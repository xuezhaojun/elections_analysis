1343923723875835905 2020-12-29 22:15:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @msSelliT Possibly, although his wording leaves something to be desired.   Talking about Brexiteers as if we are an homogenous group is inflammatory (and possibly deliberately so).
1343897663754948608 2020-12-29 20:32:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> A very high proportion of Brexiteers are working class and work in those jobs themselves, you wally! 😂
1343679460156076039 2020-12-29 06:05:22 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper @TeachertoPC Does people's perception of you change when they find out you're a police officer?
1343348639268298752 2020-12-28 08:10:48 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Berumster Weird. What happened?
1343313084979544064 2020-12-28 05:49:31 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Lakesman5 @Femi_Sorry Professional rent-a-gobs, the both of them! 😂
1343210971679092737 2020-12-27 23:03:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @RobertJTAC I live in Glasgow. Friendly people, cheap living costs, and there is beautiful countryside just a short drive away.
1342917476032663552 2020-12-27 03:37:31 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @baggy1067 Try askinf Femi about his sponsors!
1342898946855874566 2020-12-27 02:23:53 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @CentralReserva9 @Femi_Sorry This is an article he wrote:  https://t.co/8iiwtCP0G9   I don't find his reasons very convincing.
1342898235824893955 2020-12-27 02:21:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Phillipkemble @BarbaraWant @GaryMcleft @Femi_Sorry Liking your own tweet? Ouch!
1342896914778480641 2020-12-27 02:15:48 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Phillipkemble @BarbaraWant @GaryMcleft @Femi_Sorry ??? 🤔😅
1342896696251076621 2020-12-27 02:14:56 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Independent Hurrah!
1342896536729112580 2020-12-27 02:14:18 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @CentralReserva9 @Femi_Sorry I have no evidence that he's done anything illegal, but his decision not to stand in Peterborough was odd.  I mean, what rational person chooses being a professional tweeter over being an MP?
1342896020590649352 2020-12-27 02:12:15 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Phillipkemble @BarbaraWant @GaryMcleft @Femi_Sorry Whataboutery
1342886681024864258 2020-12-27 01:35:09 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Jollof101 @Terrypedia Wow! That's a bit strong! 😂
1342886483070513152 2020-12-27 01:34:21 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @emmanuelsondeji @Terrypedia Tosh. Stuff like this happens week after week. Maguire isn't good enough for a starting 11 place.
1342882105009844228 2020-12-27 01:16:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TartanTory @Femi_Sorry You'd think so, wouldn't you?
1342881993181290496 2020-12-27 01:16:31 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Yeah, and despite being a lefty, you were a huge fan of the draconian powers of the European Arrest Warrant. Pull the other one, mate!
1342879032359186438 2020-12-27 01:04:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper @Sabeenahmad1 Have you tried meditation? That may help. Also, perhaps try slow, deep abdominal breathing. A friend of mine with PTSD did that before bed, and found she didn't experience nightmares for the first time in ages.
1342868978411167744 2020-12-27 00:24:48 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper @Sabeenahmad1 Did you overcome it?
1342854930466562049 2020-12-26 23:28:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DanielCreaseyUK @Femi_Sorry Ah, so Femi is twisting things as usual!   Thanks for clarifying.
1342854600009854976 2020-12-26 23:27:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry She's said she wants to be kill British citizens? Source? I smell bs.
1342853675589447682 2020-12-26 23:23:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Is he one of the sponsors you refuse to talk about?  5:00 in   https://t.co/QbgRd53dXh
1342853016202973186 2020-12-26 23:21:22 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Why won't you answer questions about your funding?  5:00 at  https://t.co/QbgRd53dXh
1342852363644710914 2020-12-26 23:18:47 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Hey Femi, you still haven't answered our questions about your funding.  Why did you walk out of an interview where you were asked about this?  5:00 in  https://t.co/QbgRd53dXh
1342851774667915271 2020-12-26 23:16:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BarbaraWant @GaryMcleft @Femi_Sorry He does. Femi is missing out a lot of important info.  Start watching at 5:00. Spoiler alert: Femi gets extremely uncomfortable when asked about his funding, before aborting the interview:  https://t.co/QbgRd5kOOP
1342850723315384320 2020-12-26 23:12:16 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @langdon434 @Femi_Sorry I'm not sure I'd be boasting about that. :)
1342850627827867650 2020-12-26 23:11:53 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @rabid_rabitt Right, so where does the money for those designer t-shirts come from? Simple question.
1342850272842960896 2020-12-26 23:10:28 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry All we want is transparency. Where does your t-shirt/food money come from?
1342849643475046407 2020-12-26 23:07:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry 5:13  https://t.co/qNPb3Htrrv  Why did you run away when asked about your funding?
1342849063822221314 2020-12-26 23:05:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry 'We've raised over £50,000 in donations' -  https://t.co/CpD1HVbExW  Not quite the same message.
1342848192422039554 2020-12-26 23:02:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry What about the nice offices in Millbank?  And why did your advisor tell you to walk out of an interview when Katie Hopkins asked you about your funding?
1342847782743379969 2020-12-26 23:00:34 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry So how pays for your food and for those lovely t-shirts?
1342784157135605760 2020-12-26 18:47:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @StooTaylor @CentralReserva9 @Femi_Sorry I'm not the one publishing an article on the document!   It's like someone writing a review of a book they haven't read! 😂
1342738368564776962 2020-12-26 15:45:48 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @StooTaylor @CentralReserva9 @Femi_Sorry To be fair, I think it's reasonable to argue that Femi is writing about a document that he hasn't read. Don't you?
1342737426675093504 2020-12-26 15:42:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MariaReadsStuff @Femi_Sorry  https://t.co/3E60nQ14Qv  😂
1342737172454121477 2020-12-26 15:41:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MariaReadsStuff @Femi_Sorry I look forward to Femi's rigorous, impartial, balanced analysis.
1342519430589407235 2020-12-26 01:15:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @CorbynistaEdith He did loads to help make Brexit possible.
1342516429824864256 2020-12-26 01:03:54 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Thommo_online @jessphillips @cut_brick What was @sainsburys's reply?
1342446798867197952 2020-12-25 20:27:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Horseshit_McKay @HungryFor_Hands @IndustriesRyan @Femi_Sorry @sammorril Both hatreds are irrational.  As the Bhudda supposedly said, hatred is like drinking a poison and hoping it will kill the other person.
1342436361236836352 2020-12-25 19:45:44 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @meatp0ps1cl3 @RDHale_ Femi. It's Christmas, ffs! Crack open a few tins and watch a movie! 😂
1342429057749839874 2020-12-25 19:16:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HungryFor_Hands @IndustriesRyan @Femi_Sorry @sammorril I advise you to stop making assumptions. Your tone comes across as patronising. Anyway, I have better things to do at Christmas than have this conversation. Bye
1342420327444467712 2020-12-25 18:42:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ClimateWarrior7  https://t.co/wtQsxUTbzp  Your soulmate! 😂
1342416087040876545 2020-12-25 18:25:10 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MikeOGallagher @Femi_Sorry He sees himself as a savior!
1342415686283513857 2020-12-25 18:23:35 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Horseshit_McKay @HungryFor_Hands @IndustriesRyan @Femi_Sorry @sammorril You can hate whoever you want. But ask yourself this: who benefits? I prefer to enjoy life than to walk around with a head full of hatred. Life's too short.
1342414857988136960 2020-12-25 18:20:17 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HungryFor_Hands @IndustriesRyan @Femi_Sorry @sammorril Great to know, thanks.  Right, so are these protected characteristic laws a waste of time?
1342410585795919872 2020-12-25 18:03:19 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> And people accused Donald Trump of making stuff up when he said we were no longer allowed to say Merry Christmas.
1342409798411644930 2020-12-25 18:00:11 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @CorbynistaEdith  https://t.co/wtQsxVaMqX
1342319444937351168 2020-12-25 12:01:09 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HungryFor_Hands @IndustriesRyan @Femi_Sorry @sammorril Surely all hatred is to be condemned, not just that which falls foul of politically correct legislation.
1342319115508264960 2020-12-25 11:59:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HungryFor_Hands @IndustriesRyan @Femi_Sorry @sammorril But why are protected characteristics so important?  Aren't they just a modern legal construct?
1342315370342998016 2020-12-25 11:44:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @IndustriesRyan @Femi_Sorry @sammorril Does non-racist hate speech count as free speech?  Should hatred to Brexit voters be allowed? If so, why is that hatred ok to express, but not other types of hatred?
1342290824378380289 2020-12-25 10:07:25 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @GElliott26 So you want an unholy marriage of convenience, basically?
1342202175641055232 2020-12-25 04:15:10 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @nigelshortchess If Karpov vs Fischer had happened in the 70s, who do you think would have won?
1342177187106058243 2020-12-25 02:35:52 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @brokenbottleboy Why do you care so much about a party that's rejected you?
1342175617534603266 2020-12-25 02:29:38 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Femi, it's Christmas.   Step away from Twitter, stick on a DVD, crack open a few tins, and chill out!
1342173048049430529 2020-12-25 02:19:25 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BrexitBanter52 @Femi_Sorry He's already decided it's rubbish, even though he doesn't yet know what's in it! 😂
1342166347191640064 2020-12-25 01:52:48 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> Beautiful.  https://t.co/6bHU2IWAja
1342163318493081602 2020-12-25 01:40:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @bill_howarth @Femi_Sorry Or maybe not.   https://t.co/hDcKVKMinO
1342162823087009794 2020-12-25 01:38:47 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> Good to see that Femi is approaching the deal with an open mind.
1342162546757935105 2020-12-25 01:37:41 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @PMbythesea @TonyWoodlovesEU @Femi_Sorry That's a funny concept of compassion - 'I will only show you compassion if you accept that you're wrong and I'm right!'.
1342161814696697862 2020-12-25 01:34:47 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Adamtrue8 @TonyWoodlovesEU @Femi_Sorry That characterisation is unfair. I am neither a racist nor a xenophobe, nor are other Brexit supporters I know.   That kind of talk is divisive. Play the ball, not the man!
1342161393492045825 2020-12-25 01:33:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DomSturges @Peston @Femi_Sorry It makes me feel really proud. Why? Because freedoms come at a price.
1342158858748383237 2020-12-25 01:23:02 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Delores64541146 @Femi_Sorry  https://t.co/LVWigxdMN4
1342158401716031489 2020-12-25 01:21:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> I was listening to Rule Britannia while reading this and feeling a strong sense of national pride. Well done, sir! Fantastic result!   https://t.co/mdsiuU53Gh  #dealdone #theChristmasMiracle
1342135175656976384 2020-12-24 23:48:56 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @youknowit0609 @TonyWoodlovesEU @Femi_Sorry Thanks. You too.
1342135123362406405 2020-12-24 23:48:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TonyWoodlovesEU @youknowit0609 @Femi_Sorry You too. :)
1342132810371489792 2020-12-24 23:39:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Independent @tompeck Oh behave! This is a great deal for Britain! Stop being miserable and celebrate the good news!
1342132640779034629 2020-12-24 23:38:51 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> There is a lot of negativity from Remainers about this deal (which achieves things they swore were impossible). However, from what I've seen so far, this is a BRILLIANT deal for Britain and Boris has played a blinder!
1342132229913378827 2020-12-24 23:37:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TonyWoodlovesEU @youknowit0609 @Femi_Sorry You don't know that. I'm sure that, if you have a decent job or enough money to be self-sufficient, Spain would welcome you.
1342132058299236352 2020-12-24 23:36:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @youknowit0609 @TonyWoodlovesEU @Femi_Sorry I don't think so.   I used to have a Lithuanian flatmate. I'm pretty sure that he was never once on the receiving end of any hatred, as a result of Brexit or for any other reason.
1342131752777740291 2020-12-24 23:35:20 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @_alanbradbury @Femi_Sorry Let's just say that I'm very optimistic based on what I know so far.
1342131541653258240 2020-12-24 23:34:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DPJHodges A drop in the ocean (pun unintended!).
1342131246139400193 2020-12-24 23:33:19 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @youknowit0609 @TonyWoodlovesEU @Femi_Sorry But I don't see any need for nastiness, as long as opinions are expressed in a respectful manner.
1342131064819470336 2020-12-24 23:32:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SoluzioneVOX @theamonmax @Femi_Sorry "A points-based immigration system will put us in full control of who enters the UK and free movement will end."
1342131007374450689 2020-12-24 23:32:22 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SoluzioneVOX @theamonmax @Femi_Sorry "We have signed the first free trade agreement based on zero tariffs and zero quotas that has ever been achieved with the EU."  "we are not bound by EU rules, there is no role for the European Court of Justice"
1342130796736487426 2020-12-24 23:31:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TonyWoodlovesEU @youknowit0609 @Femi_Sorry No. I'm not playing that game!   I've been suckered by that one before! 😂
1342130649570963456 2020-12-24 23:30:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @youknowit0609 @TonyWoodlovesEU @Femi_Sorry Would it surprise you to learn that I have never, ever racially abused anyone? Nor, I suspect, have the vast majority of my Brexit supporting followers.
1342130423955152900 2020-12-24 23:30:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @youknowit0609 @TonyWoodlovesEU @Femi_Sorry If he walks down the street speaking Greek, he won't get any abuse. Britain thankfully isn't that kind of country.  If he posts inflammatory Remain stuff on Twitter, yeah, he'll get some stick, but that's nothing to do with him him being Greek.
1342129936245645312 2020-12-24 23:28:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @youknowit0609 @TonyWoodlovesEU @Femi_Sorry Well, that's a real shame.   I'm pleased to say that I've had good friends who I will never agree with politically, and long may that continue.
1342129513497579522 2020-12-24 23:26:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @PaulTommo1701 @Femi_Sorry Hear hear.
1342129297214087171 2020-12-24 23:25:34 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TonyWoodlovesEU @youknowit0609 @Femi_Sorry But you see, that's the funny thing. A lot of us Brexit voters are cosmopolitan people who don't have a racist bone in our bodies. A good mate of mine is from Pakistan. Another is from Nigeria. The idea that I am some Little Englander is ridiculous.
1342128987594776581 2020-12-24 23:24:20 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @theamonmax @Femi_Sorry Well, on the evidence so far, it appears that the naysayers were wrong and Boris has managed to secure us a fantastic deal.   Boris stood firm and refused to accept an unacceptable deal. He was willing to walk away from the deal, and the EU chose not to commit harakiri.
1342128283719241728 2020-12-24 23:21:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @teazle1 @Femi_Sorry Now there's a plan. :)
1342128221337362433 2020-12-24 23:21:18 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TonyWoodlovesEU @youknowit0609 @Femi_Sorry Not really. If you throw away friendships so easily, either you are a shallow person or you are full of hatred.
1342128044237058049 2020-12-24 23:20:35 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @OfVarga @BenBelcher76 @Femi_Sorry You're nitpicking.   The main thing is that we will be facing a bright economic future, contrary to Femi's apocalyptic predictions over the last 4 years.
1342127660558909440 2020-12-24 23:19:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TonyWoodlovesEU @youknowit0609 @Femi_Sorry Wow! Just wow!   If a friend or family member did that to me over Brexit, I'd take solace in the thought that anyone worth knowing wouldn't throw away the relationship over something so petty.
1342127088862638082 2020-12-24 23:16:48 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @teazle1 @Femi_Sorry It is a very high level summary.  :)
1342127023951646722 2020-12-24 23:16:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TonyWoodlovesEU @youknowit0609 @Femi_Sorry But how do you know that? I'm sure there are leavers out there with similar personalities, interests, tastes in music, etc to you. If the only thing you dislike about them is their stance on Brexit, then to turn your back on them is pretty sad.
1342126598217150464 2020-12-24 23:14:51 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BenBelcher76 @Femi_Sorry "We have signed the first free trade agreement based on zero tariffs and zero quotas that has ever been achieved with the EU."  "A points-based immigration system will put us in full control of who enters the UK and free movement will end."
1342125794588557312 2020-12-24 23:11:39 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @youknowit0609 @TonyWoodlovesEU @Femi_Sorry Why do you seek refuge in echo chambers? Are differing opinions really that intolerable?
1342125451112755202 2020-12-24 23:10:17 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @wtfyouonabout01 @Delores64541146 @Femi_Sorry Exactly. You'd think that they would be as happy as the rest of us at this fantastic outcome for Britain.
1342125143515082758 2020-12-24 23:09:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TonyWoodlovesEU @Femi_Sorry That's such a pity. I choose to be friends with people who I disagree with politically, and quite value diversity of opinion, but each to their own.
1342124868519813122 2020-12-24 23:07:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @teazle1 @Femi_Sorry Sure. Read the government statement here:  https://t.co/m6zM7godHj  You're welcome.  And here is some fitting music for this momentous occasion:  https://t.co/6K5xMl5Kzn
1342124359100604418 2020-12-24 23:05:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TonyWoodlovesEU @Femi_Sorry Let it go man.  The war is over. Time to move on. For the sake of your own mental health, if nothing else.
1342124226409590787 2020-12-24 23:05:25 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @kinorino2 @Delores64541146 @Femi_Sorry Indeed. But we are no longer a vassal state! This is a proud moment for our great nation.
1342124056007618566 2020-12-24 23:04:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @FiendsOTheEarth @Femi_Sorry "We have signed the first free trade agreement based on zero tariffs and zero quotas that has ever been achieved with the EU."  What's not to like?   I bet even you are secretly impressed! :)
1342123835496275968 2020-12-24 23:03:52 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Delores64541146 @Femi_Sorry There will things that some people object to. There is always give and take in a deal. But to quote the government statement:  "We have signed the first free trade agreement based on zero tariffs and zero quotas that has ever been achieved with the EU."  Worth celebrating, no?
1342123545716011008 2020-12-24 23:02:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BenBelcher76 @Femi_Sorry No idea what TLDR means, but read the official government summary on the BBC news website. This deal is seriously impressive stuff.
1342123359765725186 2020-12-24 23:01:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JonnyTheDean @Femi_Sorry "It means that we will have full political and economic independence on 1st January 2021."  That might not excite you, but I'm buzzing!   We faced down the EU and got a great deal.    https://t.co/6K5xMl5Kzn
1342122756066963456 2020-12-24 22:59:35 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Delores64541146 @Femi_Sorry "We have signed the first free trade agreement based on zero tariffs and zero quotas that has ever been achieved with the EU."  If that doesn't set your pulse racing, nothing will!   This is a SERIOUSLY good outcome!
1342122486717161474 2020-12-24 22:58:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @dpanch_89 @EdGeFlint @Femi_Sorry "We have signed the first free trade agreement based on zero tariffs and zero quotas that has ever been achieved with the EU."  Man, that really excites me.   I think even Femi will struggle to put a negative spin on it.
1342122180042174472 2020-12-24 22:57:17 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @EdGeFlint @Femi_Sorry 'Everything that the British public was promised during the 2016 referendum and in the general election last year is delivered by this deal."  "We have taken back control of our money, borders, laws, trade and our fishing waters'  Doesn't that excite you?
1342121901683060737 2020-12-24 22:56:11 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Femi mate, we have got a brilliant deal for Britain. It's over. Move on. And, dare I say it, celebrate the good news.
1342121252748746753 2020-12-24 22:53:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @KimberleyJayne4 @Peston Hopefully, @Femi_Sorry and Co will look in the mirror and realise that the war is over, and it's time to move on with their lives. But I doubt it.
1342099841804075009 2020-12-24 21:28:31 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Scotty2906 @Femi_Sorry No worries. :)
1342098710055051266 2020-12-24 21:24:02 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Scotty2906 @Femi_Sorry You've got the wrong end of the stick - I'm a Brexit voter! LOL!
1342089395629907968 2020-12-24 20:47:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Femi mate, chillax. The deal is about to be taken out of the oven, and it doesn't half smell nice.
1342069601027452928 2020-12-24 19:28:21 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @tomhfh Maybe you and Femi should go out for a pint to make peace and reminisce about old times, now that the war is over (though with Covid, it will have to be a virtual one!).
1342067970563059714 2020-12-24 19:21:53 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @AlistairBarrie @SimonJohnRose1 I think the Brexit deal could be the best Christmas present you ever receive, Femi. It could be the thing that prompts you to give up this fight and do something meaningful with your life instead.   The battle is over - it's time to find a new, better one.
1342065398443814912 2020-12-24 19:11:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Holbornlolz You missed out @mrjamesobrien
1342036371163254784 2020-12-24 17:16:19 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @ffcbrexiteer @matthewgibbs79 Your sponsors? 🤔
1342036047396564993 2020-12-24 17:15:02 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JohannShiel @Femi_Sorry I'm surprised Femi can find time to talk, with all the humble pie he's eating today.
1341878276839628800 2020-12-24 06:48:06 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @KaneDeffley I see this Kane fellow has blocked me, possibly for asking Femi who is target audience is! 😂
1341878022266368005 2020-12-24 06:47:06 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MikeAubury @trefeca @RobertJTAC @iainmartin1 @itvnews Mate, you've fallen into their trap! Now he'll say, 'Ah, so you don't have any logical arguments in favour of Brexit'. This is their gotcha question - anything you say will lead to mockery, so the best bet it to just ignore them.
1341877283045425153 2020-12-24 06:44:09 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Don't worry, @Nigel_Farage will provide an accurate summary of the key points for us.
1341872967983239169 2020-12-24 06:27:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JasonUoS12 @SJK415 @Femi_Sorry @KaneDeffley Likewise.
1341872369875431425 2020-12-24 06:24:38 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JasonUoS12 @SJK415 @Femi_Sorry @KaneDeffley It's Christmas - I'm not in the mood for an intense twitter debate. I'm going to give myself some time off. Have a good evening. :)
1341870298216476674 2020-12-24 06:16:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JasonUoS12 @SJK415 @Femi_Sorry @KaneDeffley I didn't think you would. I'm not playing your game. Bye.
1341869600473051137 2020-12-24 06:13:38 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Sentenren Yeah, and I've no idea what they mean by indigenous people either! That's the sort of phrase the far right use!
1341868069816299527 2020-12-24 06:07:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JasonUoS12 @SJK415 @Femi_Sorry @KaneDeffley Hmmm...    https://t.co/rEQ6N2wzAi

1341867099224993794 2020-12-24 06:03:41 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JasonUoS12 @SJK415 @Femi_Sorry @KaneDeffley Ah, that game. Ok, I'll rise to the bait. What do you think is wrong with statement A in the tweet below? 🤔   https://t.co/uu1C03gXsJ
1341864894182920192 2020-12-24 05:54:56 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JasonUoS12 @SJK415 @Femi_Sorry @KaneDeffley I think we both know that logic isn't Femi's strong point.
1341863204192960517 2020-12-24 05:48:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JasonUoS12 @SJK415 @Femi_Sorry @KaneDeffley Or maybe really gullible folk.
1341863089126445060 2020-12-24 05:47:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> Who is your target audience, Femi? 🤔
1341855853402607617 2020-12-24 05:19:00 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @Never0ffside There is a coin in my pocket. Therefore it's raining. That's the level of your so-called logic (yet there are morons out there who will lap it up, which is why Mr Soros keeps paying you).
1341828873957335048 2020-12-24 03:31:48 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> 'Brexit commentator'. 😂🤣😁😅
1341815419213144066 2020-12-24 02:38:20 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SimonD555 @Femi_Sorry I've had enough of this playground bs. You're wasting my time. Muted. Bye.
1341815026013892616 2020-12-24 02:36:46 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SimonD555 @Femi_Sorry Oh dear oh dear. Where do I even start with this ridiculous nonsense? There is absolutely zero similarity.
1341814393177255941 2020-12-24 02:34:15 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SimonD555 @Femi_Sorry Are you drunk? That makes no sense! 😂
1341814034199437312 2020-12-24 02:32:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SimonD555 @Femi_Sorry Not at me personally, but as a centre right person who he has muted, I'm sure he puts me in that camp.  Do you think that Femi needs or wants you to fight his battles?
1341813661791379457 2020-12-24 02:31:21 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SimonD555 @Femi_Sorry So you were belittling a perceived belittler of a belittler? And what does that make you? 🤔
1341813216805089283 2020-12-24 02:29:35 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SimonD555 @Femi_Sorry Is Femi one of my betters, just out of interest? 🤔
1341812995945541635 2020-12-24 02:28:42 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SimonD555 @Femi_Sorry Mate, chillax. You're taking this conversation way too seriously! 😂  I'm out. Bye.
1341812316111777796 2020-12-24 02:26:00 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SimonD555 @Femi_Sorry Yeah, you're right. I may have just achieved an MSc with distinction, but I should bow to superior minds like Simon from Twitter. I consider myself duly chastised.
1341811299492241410 2020-12-24 02:21:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SimonD555 @Femi_Sorry This is a variation of 'give me one benefit of Brexit'. Sorry pal, not playing that game today.
1341809576694439938 2020-12-24 02:15:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SimonD555 @Femi_Sorry Oh, sorry, I forgot. Everyone who disagrees with you politically must a foaming at the mouth fascist. My bad.
1341809060291723270 2020-12-24 02:13:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper Have you ever come across an instance instance in this country of a police officer arresting another police officer on the job?
1341808330394775552 2020-12-24 02:10:10 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @tonydav37104026 @Femi_Sorry I find him amusing. He's a guilty pleasure - that's the only reason I haven't blocked him ages ago!
1341808126232842245 2020-12-24 02:09:21 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Maybe they think that your apocalyptic scaremongering is unhelpful and without basis in fact?
1341807658941243393 2020-12-24 02:07:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Who are the right wing trolls? Are you referring to centre right folk who call you out?
1341680754917519360 2020-12-23 17:43:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry 'You have* to pass THROUGH France to get to the other countries!'  That's funny. I'm sure I've travelled to Holland by ferry before without passing through France.
1341468773547724803 2020-12-23 03:40:53 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @StefSimanowitz Yeah, he's great, isn't he?
1341103047670452225 2020-12-22 03:27:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JozTGAPowerful I hope you get as many likes in response to this message as you did in response to your cry for help to your 400 odd followers.
1341101202113785863 2020-12-22 03:20:17 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JozTGAPowerful I was hoping to avoid snarky comments from your lot by quoting the Guardian rather than the Mail!   I guess you can't dodge Twitter sarcasm!   Nice pile on attempt though.
1341067530455158790 2020-12-22 01:06:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TelegraphSport @Anna_Kessel Elite sports is male dominated. That's due to biology, so you might want to take your complaint up with God (if you believe in Him).

1340641376875241473 2020-12-20 20:53:06 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @FixLook @CharlotteSlalom @BreezerGalway @TheFreds @DPJHodges I can't believe a comment I was mentioned in has been liked by @TheFreds! 😍  I'm too sexy for my tweets, too sexy... 😂
1340603770061918210 2020-12-20 18:23:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @afneil Scotland does export electricity to England -  https://t.co/EfArQncdw8.  I can't view the reply to your tweet, but I think that's what you were asking about.
1340603242955325442 2020-12-20 18:21:34 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @realjimcarry @Femi_Sorry Indeed. My point exactly. Femi is talking like he's some kind of authority when he's stating the bleeding obvious.  But good sarcasm, mate!
1340591493602488320 2020-12-20 17:34:53 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @realjimcarry @Femi_Sorry Your point?
1340591425491267586 2020-12-20 17:34:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Commons39698477 @Femi_Sorry Exactly, Captain Obvious.
1340591275314167808 2020-12-20 17:34:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TOrynski @Femi_Sorry You don't need Femi to state an obvious fact, now you mention it (not that that stops him!).
1340583829648662528 2020-12-20 17:04:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Thanks, Captain!
1340583698555678727 2020-12-20 17:03:55 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Wow! I didn't realise you were an epidemiologist aa well as a Brexit expert.
1340420700792889345 2020-12-20 06:16:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BreezerGalway @FixLook @TheFreds @DPJHodges Source?  And how far outside the margin of error is that?  And how many of those deaths are because of the Covid measures, rather than because of the virus?   You need to put your ego aside and ask critical questions, or you're just going to be a hothead like @piersmorgan.
1340420107022049280 2020-12-20 06:13:51 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @CharlotteSlalom @FixLook @BreezerGalway @TheFreds @DPJHodges BTW, I know this is the bear pit known as Twitter, but when someone tells you that their brother's cancer surgery has been postponed, it's polite to express sympathy.
1340419841044455425 2020-12-20 06:12:48 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @CharlotteSlalom @FixLook @BreezerGalway @TheFreds @DPJHodges Elective surgery includes surgery that could save or massively prolong someone's life. Don't you find it concerning that such surgery is being postponed to Covid?   Do you not think that the net result is that more lives are cost than saved as a result?
1340396053003202562 2020-12-20 04:38:17 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BreezerGalway Were you hoping for a pile on?
1340395987307737092 2020-12-20 04:38:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @CharlotteSlalom @FixLook @BreezerGalway @TheFreds @DPJHodges How does that compare to car accidents? Or the seasonal flu? Or the number of people who have died early because of Covid measures (like cancer patients who are denied surgery - and before you tell me that's a myth, it happened to my brother)?
1340395668238716929 2020-12-20 04:36:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BreezerGalway @TheFreds @DPJHodges I doubt that very much - it's a pleasant story to tell yourself, but I'm met very, very few people in life who are happy to be proven wrong. Your unconscious will find a way of convincing you that you're right after all.
1340395445550522371 2020-12-20 04:35:52 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BreezerGalway @dystopianpaul @TheFreds @DPJHodges What percentage of under 70s does it kill?
1340324437460209664 2020-12-19 23:53:42 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BreezerGalway @the_boggles @TheFreds @DPJHodges @MichaelYeadon3 In other words, you've read some stuff written by people who believe what you want to believe, and your gut says that they are right.   Thank you for your honesty.
1340324228663554050 2020-12-19 23:52:52 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BreezerGalway @FixLook @TheFreds @DPJHodges Whether it's 1% or 0.2%, surely we can agree that your chances of dying from Covid are very, very slim.
1340324026279993346 2020-12-19 23:52:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BreezerGalway @TheFreds @DPJHodges @MichaelYeadon3 If you want to convince someone you really know your stuff, there are more compelling responses than that. :)
1340323759966830592 2020-12-19 23:51:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BreezerGalway @the_boggles @TheFreds @DPJHodges @MichaelYeadon3 Yes, but for every expert who says one thing, there is generally an equal expert who says the opposite. How can you, as a non-scientist, independently weigh up this matter?
1340323501652193281 2020-12-19 23:49:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BreezerGalway @FixLook @TheFreds @DPJHodges Googled it for you. It's actually about 1%.  https://t.co/OgyzmsOcgK   However, if you look at under 0s, it's vastly lower.
1340270422164697088 2020-12-19 20:19:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BreezerGalway @TheFreds @DPJHodges @MichaelYeadon3 But how do you know they are the gold standard? Are you sure you don't believe that just because some government scientist said that was the case?
1340267992614105090 2020-12-19 20:09:25 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BreezerGalway @TheFreds @DPJHodges @MichaelYeadon3 I don't have a degree in medicine. I am therefore not qualified to make that assessment (and neither, I suspect, are you).

1340266142720528385 2020-12-19 20:02:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Salajayne Not sure. When @Femi_Sorry stops posting 100 tweets a day, I'll think that something strange is happening! 😂
1340265386730795010 2020-12-19 19:59:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BreezerGalway @TheFreds @DPJHodges What methodological mistake in particular is @MichaelYeadon3 making?   Perhaps you can point to a flaw in his reasoning that he's overlooked.   As a scientist, he follows the facts, so will be happy to make a retraction if you can refute his arguments.
1340263990002413568 2020-12-19 19:53:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BreezerGalway @TheFreds @DPJHodges 'Trust the experts'.  'Which ones?'  'The government ones. They have only our best interests at heart, and they know best'.   I'd really, really love to believe that were the case, but I stopped believing in fairy tales when I was a child.
1340263658430074880 2020-12-19 19:52:11 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BreezerGalway @TheFreds @DPJHodges I don't blame you though. This is a complicated issue, and it's easier to arrive at a simple, unnuanced view and attack anyone who disagrees, than to try to properly think it through.
1340263416511016962 2020-12-19 19:51:14 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BreezerGalway @TheFreds @DPJHodges I don't think you've reached that conclusion by carefully analysing all the evidence. Your name calling and facepalm suggests that you are more interested in 'yah boo sucks' then arriving at a balanced assessment.
1340262710567583746 2020-12-19 19:48:25 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @AldiUK I'm surprised you haven't posted this:  https://t.co/P4OqhfclTG
1340251749999915010 2020-12-19 19:04:52 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BreezerGalway @TheFreds @DPJHodges Yes, I do. Do you?  And there is no need for the facepalm.  Instead of being frustrated that people disagree with you, try to undrrstand where they are coming from.  There is a credible case that lockdown measures cost far more years of life than they save.
1340247375554744321 2020-12-19 18:47:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BreezerGalway @TheFreds @DPJHodges Swedish model.   The average age of someone who dies from Covid 19 is over 80. Those people on average aren't long for this world anyway. Meantime, the Covid measures destroy lives. The cure is worse than the disease.

1339572312086097920 2020-12-17 22:05:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLammy Or maybe we could treat people as individuals, not members of groups.

1339134056844431360 2020-12-16 17:03:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @msSelliT @Thursday_12th @docrussjackson @HarryLloydJone2 Possibly, and the fact that this conversation hasn't descended into personal insults is a good sign! :)
1339130203654811649 2020-12-16 16:48:15 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @msSelliT @Thursday_12th @docrussjackson @HarryLloydJone2 Hear hear. It's extremely rare that I find myself agreeing with someone with an EU flag in their profile, but I'm happy to make an exception on this occasion! 😁
1339129109436391424 2020-12-16 16:43:54 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLammy @Conservatives I think what he said was fair comment. You do like to stir the pot, and that is bad for community cohesion (like the time your white saviours remark damaged Comic Relief).
1339127507006726145 2020-12-16 16:37:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @msSelliT @Thursday_12th @docrussjackson @HarryLloydJone2 I will concede, though, that looking at the official stats did cast serious doubts on my prior beliefs about this matter.  There you go - a first for Twitter (someone admitting they might have been wrong about something! 😂).
1339126152196214786 2020-12-16 16:32:09 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @msSelliT @Thursday_12th @docrussjackson @HarryLloydJone2 By the way, to say that there are proportionally more offenders of particular crimes from one group than another isn't demonization, as we are talking about a TINY number of people, not the group as a whole.
1339123859438579712 2020-12-16 16:23:02 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @msSelliT @Thursday_12th @docrussjackson @HarryLloydJone2 But yeah, by all means, if white men are over-represented in other sexual abuse stats compared to men of other ethnicities, that's something that needs addressing.
1339123616152215553 2020-12-16 16:22:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @msSelliT @Thursday_12th @docrussjackson @HarryLloydJone2 You are cherry picking. Have a look at  https://t.co/ogcMmtx6W7.   In the years in question, 73% of rapes of under 16 females were carried out by whites (who represent 80% of the population).
1339122192328642560 2020-12-16 16:16:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @msSelliT @Thursday_12th @docrussjackson @HarryLloydJone2 No-one is demonising anyone. But if some groups are over-represented in the conviction stats, we need as a society to have a frank conversation about that, rather than using words like 'demonize' to bury the facts.
1339119705307701251 2020-12-16 16:06:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @docrussjackson @Thursday_12th @HarryLloydJone2 Maybe that study had a HUGE margin of error. Maybe. But we should keep an open mind to the possibility that other studies might paint a similar picture (if we dare to do so).
1339119209499029505 2020-12-16 16:04:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @msSelliT @Thursday_12th @docrussjackson @HarryLloydJone2 OK, but do you not find the fact that only 30 % of grooming gang abuse is done by 80% of the population to be at all interesting? I'm no statistician, but I'm pretty sure it's unlikely to be due to random chance.   Where do you get the 90% figure from? I'd find it surprising.
1339112703353380865 2020-12-16 15:38:42 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TweetsRus14 @Muqadaam Calm down, dear. Muted  Bye.

1338959870201110534 2020-12-16 05:31:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MadWorldIndeed @TommyNobbingCum So you think he doesn't hate white paedos? 🤔
1338959594706636801 2020-12-16 05:30:18 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Thursday_12th @docrussjackson @HarryLloydJone2 Whites are 80 percent of the population. I find the fact that apparently only 30 percent of sex offenders are white to be fascinating, but maybe that's just me...
1338956512031596549 2020-12-16 05:18:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @amzkay Femi, mate.  I think you should spend less time on Twitter and more time on eBay. Selling t-shirts. Honestly mate, you wouldn't need to rely on handouts from your sponsors if you launched your own fashion label!
1338955871309737992 2020-12-16 05:15:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TweetsRus14 @Muqadaam You clearly put a lot of thought into that eloquent tweet!
1338932029581307904 2020-12-16 03:40:46 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper @TPS_32Planner Sure, but you'd expect white man to be responsible for the majority of crime across the board, given that whites represent 80% of the UK population.   The interesting question is whether some groups are proportionally over-represented (and if so, why and what can be done).
1338931187667103747 2020-12-16 03:37:25 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @__mike91 Are you a parody account?  I'll just leave this here:  'Where data was available 30% of offenders were White, while 28% were Asian.'
1338931001842667523 2020-12-16 03:36:41 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HarryLloydJone2 @docrussjackson 'Where data was available 30% of offenders were White, while 28% were Asian.'  What's your take on that?   I mean, technically the Guardian headline is accurate, but it's a tad misleading, no?
1338930449108922370 2020-12-16 03:34:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @docrussjackson do you know what the word 'proportionally' means?
1338930216606064642 2020-12-16 03:33:34 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Muqadaam Because you like celebrating 4-1 cowardace?
1338930077040578561 2020-12-16 03:33:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TommyNobbingCum I'm pretty sure that he hates white paedos too. Didn't he beat one up who was taking pictures of his young daughter?
1338929798937251842 2020-12-16 03:31:54 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @nickiabbey What has he said that offends you?
1338928872574898182 2020-12-16 03:28:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper @TPS_32Planner 'Where data was available 30% of offenders were White, while 28% were Asian'.  OK, the study those stats came from has limitations, but surely it raises important questions?
1338927717958504450 2020-12-16 03:23:38 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper @TPS_32Planner If you look more closely, you may find that there are other groups that are over-represented.  I can understand your reluctance to discuss that matter, as a serving police officer, but it's something that we, as a society, need to have a mature conversation about.
1338915927581216769 2020-12-16 02:36:47 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Will your sponsors keep on coughing up after No Deal? 🤔

I'd genuinely be interested in the results of polls on Leave voters.   I'm afraid Femi's anecdote doesn't cut it.

1338614805456883717 2020-12-15 06:40:14 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MiaFarrow Trump knows.  Whether he cares is another matter.  I don't think he's played all his cards yet.

1338573607753179136 2020-12-15 03:56:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Nikolai_speaks @nigelshortchess @chesscom As in Fischer would eat them alive?  He might do. See:   https://t.co/16eBSBP5Ex.   And if you gave both players an openings database, then that Fischer's chances would probably be significantly increased.

1338549358179053569 2020-12-15 02:20:10 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @sirtonexxx @Femi_Sorry It didn't take long for Godwin"s Law to kick in! 😂🤣
1338548870440218628 2020-12-15 02:18:14 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JanakD @Femi_Sorry I can see you put a lot of thought into that. Bravo!
1338548717113270278 2020-12-15 02:17:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry You realise we will all die sooner or later, right?
1338521781779521543 2020-12-15 00:30:35 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Femi - Has anyone ever told you that you sound like a broken record (albeit one with a very strange sound)?
1338259749293469698 2020-12-14 07:09:22 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DPJHodges I'm surprised you haven't mentioned Le Carre's A Murder of Quality, given that your mother starred in the adaptation.
1338233831422365697 2020-12-14 05:26:23 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HomeTruths111 @MarcBozza @BorisJohnson With his majority, he could change the law.
1338226900829876229 2020-12-14 04:58:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Berumster Anyone else think he looks like that bloke off Family Guy?
1338169826766950402 2020-12-14 01:12:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @naomirwolf What was the corresponding percentage increase for men?
1338168094943010818 2020-12-14 01:05:10 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @CentralReserva9 @Tweeet_Book @Femi_Sorry I like his tweet. It's put me in the mood for some patriotic music.   https://t.co/PGftGrWzVB
1338167902533455881 2020-12-14 01:04:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry You've just put me in the mood for some music.   https://t.co/PGftGrWzVB

1338149411147436034 2020-12-13 23:50:55 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DarrenT80650487 @phunkybasso @Femi_Sorry @Briefings_Brit @RemindMe_OfThis Sam probably thinks that I am a far right thug, but I'm just a fairly moderate right of centre guy who happened to vote for Brexit. And although he hates me, I bear him no ill will, and wish him only success and happiness.
1338144077573844992 2020-12-13 23:29:44 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @phunkybasso @DarrenT80650487 @Femi_Sorry @Briefings_Brit @RemindMe_OfThis Sam - I'm curious. Do you haveva girlfriend?
1338142156331085825 2020-12-13 23:22:06 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @phunkybasso @DarrenT80650487 @Femi_Sorry @Briefings_Brit @RemindMe_OfThis You might also want to brush up on your punctuation.  https://t.co/S9sRwfX407  You seem like a very angry person. Have you considered counselling?
1338140803374460931 2020-12-13 23:16:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @phunkybasso @DarrenT80650487 @Femi_Sorry @Briefings_Brit @RemindMe_OfThis You could do with googling before you tweet, yourself. 😂   https://t.co/pXAsfNRr8l
1338131450785370118 2020-12-13 22:39:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jeremycorbyn Did you ask @hackneyabbott to notify you when it was 2:30?
1338128259616301058 2020-12-13 22:26:52 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BorisJohnson Utterly ridiculous.  Stop messing about!   Force the EU to declare their hand with a firm deadline.
1338127496005492737 2020-12-13 22:23:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JustMeBeingMe4 So what evidence have you seen that you find particularly compelling?
1338127264962244611 2020-12-13 22:22:55 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JustMeBeingMe4 Yeah, but maybe there was no victim in this case? Innocent until proven guilty.
1338126939354263554 2020-12-13 22:21:38 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @akamisspink @kulthum_x @ricericebabby It's also a shame that many burgulars and murderers walk free, but I'm glad we have innocent until proven guilty.
1338126636299014144 2020-12-13 22:20:25 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @kulthum_x @ricericebabby Any evidence to back up that serious allegation, or are you just making stuff up?
1338126454731796484 2020-12-13 22:19:42 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @kulthum_x Maybe there was zero realistic prospect of conviction? 🤔
1338126281116889091 2020-12-13 22:19:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @IBRice101 You must be very confident to display your ignorance so openly.
1338125991617716226 2020-12-13 22:17:52 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HomeMusings Do you have any evidence tuat that's what happened, or are you just being mischievous?
1338125785979359232 2020-12-13 22:17:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ThomasEvans1984 I agree.  To make cheap political capital out of this is disgraceful.
1338105226746875911 2020-12-13 20:55:21 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLammy Give it time!
1338098199836446720 2020-12-13 20:27:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Fox_Claire Quite.  And meanwhile, businesses are unable to make preparations as they don't know where they'll stand.  We need to set a firm and final deadline.
1338094393065172994 2020-12-13 20:12:18 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @phunkybasso @DarrenT80650487 @Femi_Sorry @Briefings_Brit @RemindMe_OfThis I've never blamed foreigners for my inadequacies.  You have some very strange beliefs.

1338092380340314112 2020-12-13 20:04:18 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @phunkybasso @DarrenT80650487 @Femi_Sorry @Briefings_Brit Are you old enough to remember the dawn of the millennium? I am. Some people were expecting planes to fall out of the sky due to the Y2K bug. Instead, nothing happened.   Similarly, there won't be any seismic changes due to No Deal Brexit. It will be business as usual.
1338091373145231361 2020-12-13 20:00:18 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @terrychristian Yes   Do you?

1338090948295847937 2020-12-13 19:58:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Peston Do you think that Princess Nut Nuts will allow no deal to happen?
1338090537019183108 2020-12-13 19:56:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @phunkybasso @DarrenT80650487 @Femi_Sorry @Briefings_Brit Do you accept that some Brexit supporters are wiser than you?  I think you need to open your mind to the possibility that you are wrong.
1338089078366072834 2020-12-13 19:51:11 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @phunkybasso @DarrenT80650487 @Femi_Sorry @Briefings_Brit Do you accept that some Brexit supporters are far more intelligent than you?

1338087345615216640 2020-12-13 19:44:18 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @emilyhewertson Princess Nut Nuts won't let us leave without a deal.
1338086235781410816 2020-12-13 19:39:53 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @phunkybasso @DarrenT80650487 @Femi_Sorry To be fair, you started with the personal insults with your ignorant sweeping generalisation about Brexit supporters.
1338085866858815490 2020-12-13 19:38:25 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @phunkybasso @DarrenT80650487 @Femi_Sorry Even the academics over at @Briefings_Brit? 🤔
1338078666492874752 2020-12-13 19:09:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @afneil Is that tumbleweed I see before me? 🤔

1338074292794298382 2020-12-13 18:52:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Yet you aren't excited when they hold Remainers to account. 🤔
1338067943700238336 2020-12-13 18:27:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Saffronflowers @swiftyonstoke @KymriskaDraken @jessphillips I'm looking forward to a relaxing Christmas.  How about you?

1338053814205771777 2020-12-13 17:31:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @KymriskaDraken @youwon_getover @swiftyonstoke @jessphillips Your sarcasm in unwarranted. I didn't say it was a bad thing. 😎  Nice try though! 😁

1338051317248499713 2020-12-13 17:21:08 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @youwon_getover @KymriskaDraken @swiftyonstoke @jessphillips No, that's just your silly interpretation. Nice try at gaslighting, though.  Do you dispute that there are some constituencies where people will elect any candidate, as long as they are Labour?
1338049425361563648 2020-12-13 17:13:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @youwon_getover @KymriskaDraken @swiftyonstoke @jessphillips Who? Me or the other John? I don't think either of us do!

1337880580260814849 2020-12-13 06:02:41 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JayML2020 @Peston Yes, it is, if it drives up prices.  Why not let the free market determine standards?

1337688176710864899 2020-12-12 17:18:09 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @officialbarnesy Why? Do you feel it is insulting to players of other races?

1335151986401042433 2020-12-05 17:20:14 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @StooTaylor @Femi_Sorry Well done! Give yourself a gold star for spotting a typo. No, give yourself two - you deserve another one for sucking up to Femi. Good for you!
1335144206835347457 2020-12-05 16:49:19 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Femi the Mercliless! 😧

1334965320096866305 2020-12-05 04:58:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jonlis1 .@Femi_Sorry did. 🤔
1334964850964000768 2020-12-05 04:56:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MarkJudge01 @afneil Yes, and it still is. What we are seeing is bluff and bluster.
1334964626786840577 2020-12-05 04:55:44 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @chas_drew @afneil It may well prove to be. Think about it.

1334168536365871106 2020-12-03 00:12:21 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister @Jacob_Rees_Mogg Not really - just patiently trying to show you why you are wrong. :)
1334162442788724736 2020-12-02 23:48:08 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister Remember that, if @Jacob_Rees_Mogg tweets a blatant lie, it can seriously damage his career (whereas Femi's sponsors probably don't care too much whether Femi's tweets are truthful).
1334161068533440514 2020-12-02 23:42:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister I am inclined to believe that Mr Rees-Mogg was being truthful in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
1334160866942611456 2020-12-02 23:41:52 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister Agree, but it would be kind of awkward to unilaterally decide that we don't need to play by an EU rule if we were still an EU member.
1334160070695907330 2020-12-02 23:38:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister It's not a question of whether EU laws allow it. The question is whether EU approval is needed, and as Mr Mogg points out, we changed our laws so that it wasn't needed.
1334155810402947073 2020-12-02 23:21:47 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister If it weren't for Brexit, we wouldn't be getting the vaccine next week.
1334153088207351809 2020-12-02 23:10:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister Is the Leader of the Commons not to be trusted?
1334151271083806721 2020-12-02 23:03:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister  https://t.co/nTSxcODSpL  Another logical prominent Brexit supporter.

1334148566693126151 2020-12-02 22:53:00 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister 'This has nothing to do with Brexit.'  Hurrah! You have finally conceded that Femi's 'despite Brexit' comment was tosh!
1334145597901840384 2020-12-02 22:41:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister Tell me this then. Why is France not getting the vaccine next week? How about Germany and Portugal?
1334144068071337984 2020-12-02 22:35:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister This is what this discussion reminds me of. :)  https://t.co/IPTz6WVmVm
1334143358550347776 2020-12-02 22:32:18 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister OK, so:  - If Britain hadn't once been a member of the EU, we might not be getting the vaccine next week. You've got me nailed to the wall on that one.  BUT   - If Britain were still an EU member, we wouldn't be betting it next week. That is incontrovertible.
1334140650149859329 2020-12-02 22:21:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister Yes, I'm sure an EU law was used.  But the fact remains that, if we were still in the EU, we wouldn't be getting the vaccine next week.   Do you accept that much?  Honestly, I'm not making a really intricate, hard to understand argument here - this is basic logic. :)
1334138601563623424 2020-12-02 22:13:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister OK, let's break this down.  France isn't getting the vaccine yet. This is because it hasn't been given EU approval, and France is a member of the EU.  Britain isn't a member of the EU, so can do whatever it wants.  Yet as per Femi, Britain getting the vaccine was despite Brexit!
1334138084586369025 2020-12-02 22:11:21 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister He's wrong all the time, and people regularly call him out for it, but I've yet to see him admit an error, ever, yet alone apologise!   And he is definitely wrong in this instance.
1334131023911727111 2020-12-02 21:43:17 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister  https://t.co/C2sRhrWi71  As I say, Femi is being dishonest - either with us, or with himself.
1334129048260399105 2020-12-02 21:35:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister See above. I already have done.
1334127685346406401 2020-12-02 21:30:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister That's irrelevant.   Femi committed a logical fallacy - the only question is whether he did so deliberately.
1334125838242078721 2020-12-02 21:22:41 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister It wasn't despite Brexit - it was hardly the case that Brexit impeded this drug being passed!  Yet the morons who worship Femi will lap it up! 😂
1334119877976743938 2020-12-02 20:59:00 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister Do you think Femi is using sound logic here?  https://t.co/3g6QwGAnTV
1334103792724434945 2020-12-02 19:55:05 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister Premise A -&gt; Conclusion C  If Premise A is false and replaced by Premise B, it is still possible that:  Premise B -&gt; Conclusion C  No logical breakdown.
1334101738413051909 2020-12-02 19:46:55 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister Because, despite the error, the theory was sound?
1334101536721526784 2020-12-02 19:46:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister I suspect you took him out of context.  Otherwise, the claim would be easy to find on Google.
1334100370176561152 2020-12-02 19:41:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister To save me watching the whole thing, at what point does he make the claim?
1334100092001923072 2020-12-02 19:40:22 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister You could, but that is kind out of the scope of this discussion. :)
1334099637104504833 2020-12-02 19:38:34 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister No, but you could retract your false claim.

1334098460447027201 2020-12-02 19:33:53 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry @toadmeister So the purpose of your question was not to seek knowledge, but to mock a Brexit supporter. 😁  I'm pretty sure he doesn't believe that, btw!   Here are a few more intelligent Brexit supporters for you:  https://t.co/abCEVYv0le
1334096479187820548 2020-12-02 19:26:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry So is @johnredwood.

1334095748355543040 2020-12-02 19:23:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry I'm quite an admirer of @toadmeister.
1334093616508260352 2020-12-02 19:14:39 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry A lot of Brexit voters are very logical people.  I have an MSc with distinction from a top uni. You need decent critical faculties to achieve that.
1334092563503046656 2020-12-02 19:10:28 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pigmaher @Femi_Sorry It's not very constructive or mature though, is it?  Why not try to engage them in polite debate instead?
1334087054658072576 2020-12-02 18:48:34 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @cprooney @aliceclara69 @paulrey99 Order a Scotch egg. Order several beers. Drink the beers. Leave the Scotch egg untouched. Job's a goodun!

1333551115934298112 2020-12-01 07:18:56 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Surely only suitably qualified people should submit opinions (and that ain't you!).

1333410347605241856 2020-11-30 21:59:35 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Independent Is he a mate of Jezza's? 🤔
1333398330467102720 2020-11-30 21:11:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MarieAnnUK That says more about them than it does about her.  Why attend a seat of learning if you enjoy ignorance that much?

1333332803262566400 2020-11-30 16:51:27 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLammy What would a good level of rape prosecution be, David?  Do you think it's worth dragging both the alleged victim and the presumed innocent accused through the courts when there is no realistic prospect of conviction?
1333332454615216131 2020-11-30 16:50:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Gavllen @Femi_Sorry A huge proportion of murderers and burglars also get away with it.   I'm not sure what Femi's solution is? Lower the threshold of proof required for a guilty verdict?   If that happens, I hope that Femi isn't the victim of a false rape allegation and hoist by his own petard.
1333331628689682438 2020-11-30 16:46:47 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @paulddp @Femi_Sorry Googled it for you. He's still on bail and not attending the Commons.  https://t.co/lnJl6y8Cwg

1333070965299957780 2020-11-29 23:31:00 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @AlStewartOBE @gabyhinsliff @carriesymonds I'm sure she's a lovely person, but I can't help thinking of Lady Macbeth when I hear her name...
1333068810442731520 2020-11-29 23:22:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @pedpsychdoc @Telegraph I don't think controlling behaviour is sophisticated.
1332972874764857346 2020-11-29 17:01:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper Also, why were the BLM protestors allowed to protest during a lockdown?  If they had been right wing protestors, I imagine the police would have told them that they were breaking the law, instructed them to disperse, and arrested anyone who continued with the protests.
1332972602646794246 2020-11-29 17:00:08 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper Fair enough.   The impression I got was that the BLM protests/riots (depending on your perspective) were very poorly policed.   I remember that, at one point, the police were literally being chased away by protestors. That should never happen.
1332972125209194497 2020-11-29 16:58:14 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BeardedAvenger1 @GlennHorton1 @LadyUnicorn88 @Femi_Sorry @ASK_des I'm not, as long as Soros comes out and admits that he pays Femi to tweet propaganda 24/7.  It's the secrecy that concerns me.

1332847746655641601 2020-11-29 08:44:00 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper What would you say to the criticism that the police were far more heavy handed with the anti-lockdown protesters than they were with the BLM protesters?
1332846529330221059 2020-11-29 08:39:10 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JohnImrie10 @danprickett @Fox_Claire Valid point.
1332840548764364802 2020-11-29 08:15:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JohnImrie10 @danprickett @Fox_Claire Yes, but equally Eton is a commercial organisation, and having teachers promoting the Holocaust probably isn't good for business. :)
1332781855939186688 2020-11-29 04:22:11 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @piersmorgan Amusement?  Maybe you are a guilty pleasure for him?
1332770545746800640 2020-11-29 03:37:14 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JohnCleese Was that the case back when you worked for them?
1332732891701407744 2020-11-29 01:07:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Miss_Snuffy Would you ever sack a teacher for expressing a political view? Presumably you feel there are some lines one shouldn't cross, such as advocating eugenics?

1332695730377682944 2020-11-28 22:39:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Nonsensebolloc1 @Fox_Claire He actually said that? Wow! 😍 I had no idea he was a secret admirer of mine.
1332681430242123777 2020-11-28 21:43:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Nonsensebolloc1 @Fox_Claire No, I haven't, but you make it sound really enticing. Do you have a link please?
1332679189753974785 2020-11-28 21:34:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @RichieLionel81 @LeeHurstComic @rickygervais Lee hasn't blocked you. 😂  Again, what's funny and what's offensive are entirely subjective.
1332666201873506305 2020-11-28 20:42:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @piersmorgan Just what you need to relax to after a hard, tiring day at the office.
1332665879490945025 2020-11-28 20:41:20 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @RichieLionel81 @LeeHurstComic The only way you'll avoid offending anyone is by producing utterly bland comedy (which seems to be all we are left with these days, at least in the MSM).
1332665654546231296 2020-11-28 20:40:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @RichieLionel81 @LeeHurstComic But surely comedy is in the eye of the beholder.  What one person finds offensive, another person finds hilarious.   The only mistake is for the offended person to assume that there must be something wrong with the person who is laughing.
1332653973615104002 2020-11-28 19:54:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MarkStevenBlurb @JuliaHB1 Jezza is the one with the beard.  That's about the only difference.
1332653451206033408 2020-11-28 19:51:56 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DALEET @LeeHurstComic War and poverty make me sad, not someone's tweets! 😂
1332652807099478016 2020-11-28 19:49:23 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @gerryfriend @LeeHurstComic Considering he's a multi-millionaire, unlikely.
1332652571232788482 2020-11-28 19:48:27 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @RichieLionel81 @LeeHurstComic Maybe you should show us how comedy should be done. Ricardo.  Sir, the stage is yours...
1332645232240889857 2020-11-28 19:19:17 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @danprickett @Fox_Claire Thank you.   For him to be sacked for that is disturbing indeed.   If he had been denying the Holocaust or advocating eugenics, then you might argue that Eton were right to sack him, but not for taking on a radical worldview!
1332638205108236289 2020-11-28 18:51:21 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Fox_Claire It's a very well written letter, but it would be good if it had explained what heinous thought crime Mr Knowland had committed.  What did he say that was so terrible?
1332637607482830848 2020-11-28 18:48:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MrCEssex1 @CorbynistaEdith I'm well aware that Edith is a parody. :)
1332634013790593025 2020-11-28 18:34:42 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MrCEssex1 @CorbynistaEdith It's the ultimate gotcha.  Tell them to consult Google, and they reply 'So you have no arguments'.  Come up with a list of arguments, and they just mock the arguments or ignore them.   Best approach is to just ignore them.
1332609760026357764 2020-11-28 16:58:20 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @dannyroscoe7 Some good advice.   https://t.co/9Mqa0GRyce
1332452737297092613 2020-11-28 06:34:23 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper Do police keep a log of where they travel to when guarding the royals?  I'm surprised that police records haven't cleared up the Pizza Hut in Working claim.

You would be giving in to people who want to control you and create something for people to be offended about.   I'm offended by war and poverty. People using the word 'guys'? Not so much...
1331677688512262144 2020-11-26 03:14:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @sarniejewell @DPJHodges You seem to forget that it's the people's money.  Shouldn't my opinion on what my taxes are spent on count?

1329546417791242240 2020-11-20 06:05:42 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @cinderemma__ @ThomasEvans1984 He speaks his mind, rather than coming out with bland platitudes that are unlikely to offend anyone, but which use a lot of words to say basically nothing.

I can't prove with 100% certainty it exists. However, I doubt very much that a government minister would make a claim that could ruin his career easily be refuted if false.

1327965432503037954 2020-11-15 21:23:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @GWR71 @jrcharles_93 @PaulPsmith67 @DavidLammy He's quoting a study.  The study may be imperfect, but as it represents the view of experts who have studied the matter, I'm happy to go with it.
1327964096038375425 2020-11-15 21:18:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @GWR71 @jrcharles_93 @DavidLammy I've acknowledged that things may be tough.  Freeing ourselves from being a vassal state was always going to come at a cost.

1327961182280568834 2020-11-15 21:06:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @GWR71 @jrcharles_93 @PaulPsmith67 @DavidLammy So was the minister lying?  If you have evidence of that, you're wasting your time with me. Go tell me national papers, because it will be a big story. You could be interviewed by Channel 4 this evening.   However, I suspect you don't have evidence of that. Just a hunch...
1327960632319221760 2020-11-15 21:04:21 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jrcharles_93 @GWR71 @DavidLammy Not really.  If I had a few hours to spare this afternoon, and if I thought you would be grateful and actually thank me for proving you wrong, I'd be happy to oblige.  But the idea that what I wrote is a concession is a logical fallacy (google it).
1327959413479583746 2020-11-15 20:59:31 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @GWR71 @PaulPsmith67 @jrcharles_93 @DavidLammy Have you actually read my responses?!?   Studies show that the loss of export revenue will be offset by the increase in home sales.  It's pretty straightforward! 😂

1327957532904738817 2020-11-15 20:52:02 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jrcharles_93 @DavidLammy Damn! You got me! You sucked me into wasting my time on you!   If I say nothing, I get mocked.  If I show you why you're wrong, rather than thanking for disabusing you of your ignorance, you respond with scorn.  It's been a blast. Bye.
1327957253048168449 2020-11-15 20:50:56 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @GWR71 @jrcharles_93 @DavidLammy I refer the right honourable gentleman to the answer I gave some moments ago.

1327954250815725569 2020-11-15 20:39:00 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jrcharles_93 @DavidLammy You can google them yourself.   You haven't even bothered to thank me for the last request I patiently fulfilled.  I'm happy to trust that minister wasn't making up studies when he spoke with Marr.
1327953072870526976 2020-11-15 20:34:19 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLammy Great. Too much power in the hands of unelected judges is undemocratic.
1327951840663769089 2020-11-15 20:29:25 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jrcharles_93 @DavidLammy Well, the government's stats say it will.  I'll go with that.  You're welcome.
1327950577066782721 2020-11-15 20:24:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @AndrewMarr9 @SophyRidgeSky Not another one of your silly countdowns! Lord save us all! 😂🤣😁
1327949756782489602 2020-11-15 20:21:08 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jrcharles_93 @DavidLammy Our dairy farmers will sell less abroad, but that will be offset by them selling more at home.   Simples!
1327949181298872320 2020-11-15 20:18:51 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jrcharles_93 @DavidLammy Answer my question. Then ask yourself who might fill the void if domestic demand for EU dairy products drops.   It"s really not rocket science! 😂
1327947531163234306 2020-11-15 20:12:18 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jrcharles_93 @DavidLammy Ffs! I'm trying to help you to understand where your logic breaks down, and this is the gratitude I get! 😂
1327946388450258947 2020-11-15 20:07:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jrcharles_93 @GWR71 @DavidLammy Thinking isn't your strong point, is it? 😂
1327946268191182849 2020-11-15 20:07:17 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jrcharles_93 @DavidLammy What do you think will happen to domestic demand for EU dairy products when we slap on tariffs? 🤔
1327945694146162688 2020-11-15 20:05:00 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @GWR71 @jrcharles_93 @DavidLammy Sorry, my apologies. I forgot I was obliged to reply to tweets instantly.
1327933230763433986 2020-11-15 19:15:28 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jrcharles_93 @DavidLammy Why? Do you struggle with basic English comprehension?
1327932959685570560 2020-11-15 19:14:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @twentysixbux @Femi_Sorry @jdmanjohn @makai_95 But it is if it affects him?
1327932826189238272 2020-11-15 19:13:52 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @tartanmarvel89 @Femi_Sorry @jdmanjohn @makai_95 Ridiculous argument. Scotland is not a nation state, and hopefully never will be one.
1327931926473285633 2020-11-15 19:10:17 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLammy You might not understand it, but it makes perfect sense.
1327774621106626561 2020-11-15 08:45:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Steven_Swinford @jjcwow @oliver_wright Shame it's behind a paywall.
1327774007685484552 2020-11-15 08:42:46 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @PrisonPlanet Maybe this is where @Femi_Sorry has been going wrong.
1327768951129055236 2020-11-15 08:22:41 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @sjcbck @JuliaHB1 It wasn't when I took the tube from Kelvinbridge to Partick at about 6 this evening - it was dead then - but I'll take your word that it was busy earlier. :)
1327760551032852485 2020-11-15 07:49:18 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @AlStewartOBE @HMTAllegra Do you think that the cold exterior might be a front, masking vulnerability?
1327744050447921154 2020-11-15 06:43:44 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JuliaHB1 It's like that here in Glasgow too. When I take the tube to work at 8.50, there are a handful of people on the platform.
1327737914017648640 2020-11-15 06:19:21 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @theabsolutetom @jessphillips Jess's?
1327619782653468675 2020-11-14 22:29:56 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jessphillips Don't you come from a priviliged background, despite your fishwife manner?
1327619530349285377 2020-11-14 22:28:56 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jessphillips But he is.  Whereas you are part of the pc establishment, even though you like to see yourself as a bolshy rebel.
1327619236366323713 2020-11-14 22:27:46 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SnowStormBlue Pass. :)
1327615304860643328 2020-11-14 22:12:09 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SnowStormBlue I think it boils down to how you interpret the question, i.e.  a/(bc)  Or  (a/b)c  Not 100 percent sure, to be honest, though I suspect the former is correct.
1327611904802631691 2020-11-14 21:58:38 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Grassburn1 So Python and Excel are wrong? 🤔
1327611602707881984 2020-11-14 21:57:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Xinixia1 Excel understands the horseshit 'as is'. :)
1327610870214631427 2020-11-14 21:54:31 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @amy38499053 Not saying you're wrong, but Python and Excel both tell me the answer is 9. :)
1327608400289689601 2020-11-14 21:44:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SnowStormBlue Your husband entered it into Excel incorrectly then. :)
1327608074027339777 2020-11-14 21:43:25 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SnowStormBlue @Snowcatt If you google this puzzle, there are videos on it.
1327607978791464966 2020-11-14 21:43:02 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SnowStormBlue @Snowcatt I really wouldn't. :)  The codes are indeed read left to right - that has never changed.  I'd read up on BODMAS. Honestly, once the penny drops, it's pretty straightforward.
1327602876466728960 2020-11-14 21:22:46 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SnowStormBlue @Snowcatt When I put the following into Python, I get an output of '9':  print(6/2*(1+2))  When I put =6/(2÷(1+2)) into an Excel cell, I also get an output of 9.  So it makes no difference.
1327601200255078401 2020-11-14 21:16:06 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SnowStormBlue @Snowcatt As far as I know, there is no difference between ÷ and /.
1327597452652912641 2020-11-14 21:01:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Snowcatt @SnowStormBlue I'm going to do something you rarely see on Twitter, and admit an error! It seems that the answer is in fact 9!  https://t.co/QmVgI3cInm
1327596493386211328 2020-11-14 20:57:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Snowcatt @SnowStormBlue Remember that 2(1+2) is like 'x', a standalone unit. It needs to be treated like it's in brackets.  Again though, I could be wrong!
1327595409922007042 2020-11-14 20:53:05 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Snowcatt @SnowStormBlue 6 / 2(1+2)  Let's do this alegebraically.  C / A(B+A)  C / (AB + A^2)  6 / (2 + 4)  1   QED, surely?
1327594285454254083 2020-11-14 20:48:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Snowcatt @SnowStormBlue Unless things have changed since I did my MSc in Software Development last year, I'm pretty sure the answer is 1.  Not 100 percent sure though.
1327202971730534401 2020-11-13 18:53:41 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Independent The left post far worse and get away with it.
1327202727647174657 2020-11-13 18:52:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper This is ridiculous. It should be based on ability, end of.
1327038139794386947 2020-11-13 07:58:42 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Iromg How come @Femi_Sorry didn't make last year's list? 🤔
1327032031398735872 2020-11-13 07:34:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SaraBuckley1972 @Jon_statistics Sorry for your loss.
1326981265921339392 2020-11-13 04:12:42 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @tomhfh @Femi_Sorry I think that Femi should take up selling kid's t-shirts on eBay as a hobby, as he is clearly into those 'I'm just a big kid really' t-shirts!
1326967304404557826 2020-11-13 03:17:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry I wonder how long it will be before Tom joins the list of people who have handed Femi's ass to him! 😂
1326943459672985601 2020-11-13 01:42:28 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @piersmorgan @RishiSunak @GMB No, you banned him! 😆
1326807011888156674 2020-11-12 16:40:17 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Wtfyouonabout1 @Femi_Sorry I don't think he's really reading any manifestos (apart from page flicking, at a push). Just a hunch...
1326638035111383041 2020-11-12 05:28:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLammy @MattHancock @bbcquestiontime Probably thinking, 'Why have they wasted my time by putting this simpleton on the same show as me?'.
1326637556851765253 2020-11-12 05:26:55 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @aughey_steve @StevePogson1 @afneil All I'm saying is that it is an established concept, rather than a figment of Ms Abbott's imagination. :)
1326630844610580488 2020-11-12 05:00:15 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @aughey_steve @StevePogson1 @afneil This Steve guy seems like a bit of a tool, so I am loathe to back him him, but the Global South does exist:  https://t.co/bkOR3x3byE.

1325873693612978178 2020-11-10 02:51:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @piersmorgan Not sure the feeling is mutual.
1325863184922710019 2020-11-10 02:09:51 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ThatConnorGirl @UtdMoosY @0oonthe @BBCSport If by 'butt-hurt', you mean logically thinking and offended by idiocy, I'd agree.
1325862962192658432 2020-11-10 02:08:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @0oonthe @BBCSport Well virtue signalled, you.  Why not write 'I am a decent person, not a fascist' though, just to leave no doubt whatsoever about what a fine human being you are?
1325862690338861056 2020-11-10 02:07:53 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @goal They are a business, not a charity.
1325862510579298306 2020-11-10 02:07:10 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> You mean her views are the same as your own? #BBCbias @DefundBBC
1325862235596578817 2020-11-10 02:06:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HazzaR1997 Which race does he regard as inherently inferior?
1325862153262395395 2020-11-10 02:05:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @abugorowies @KilclooneyJohn Classy. I bet your mother is proud.
1325765768601022464 2020-11-09 19:42:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @realBlackInk @themetskipper That's not the strongest of arguments. :)
1325586312649379842 2020-11-09 07:49:39 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper @tylerjkayy Faor enough. You're the police officer. He just struck me as a bit of an idiot, but not a genuine threat.
1325585977944006658 2020-11-09 07:48:19 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Berumster No-one is perfect, and the world is an imperfect place.   Don't beat yourself up. A useless friend wouldn't have posted that tweet as he wouldn't give a damn. The fact that you did shows you care.   Just change what you can and accept the rest. That's all anyone can do.
1325584646655119360 2020-11-09 07:43:02 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper @tylerjkayy You can attack first if you sense someone is about to punch you, sure. But that didn't look to me what was going on. The guy was making a peaceful protest. A firm warning might have been a more appropriate initial response.
1325583640437415938 2020-11-09 07:39:02 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper @realBlackInk He was one man. There were multiple officers. I am sure they could have just popped him in handcuffs and arrested him for breach of the peace. No need to use violence.
1325583010947870720 2020-11-09 07:36:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper Could the officer not have prevented his progress without shoving him to the ground?
1325577604167069697 2020-11-09 07:15:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @spikedonline Et tu, Brendan. Et tu...

1325505895535693825 2020-11-09 02:30:06 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @teznat87 Some of us guys like a bit of hair. :)
1325505353321226241 2020-11-09 02:27:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @gavin_jon @Femi_Sorry Interesting that she is willing to work with someone she considers to be guilty of sexual assault (not to mention a racist).
1325503422859239425 2020-11-09 02:20:17 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> I am a Tory, and I also think that @jeremycorbyn should be reinstated (ideally as party leader, but sadly that ain't gonna happen).
1325503068054712322 2020-11-09 02:18:52 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JoosyJew Brutal, but fair.
1325502507070730241 2020-11-09 02:16:38 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Have you deleted the fake news about Bojo that you posted earlier?
1325463827174002688 2020-11-08 23:42:56 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Fake news. Please delete.

1325455769563750400 2020-11-08 23:10:55 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Falafelmonster1 @markbutchr @Doctor_Thomas @vince_rhodes @Femi_Sorry Damn right it is! And yours from reading tabloids! 😊
1325407545066917895 2020-11-08 19:59:18 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jwbottomley @MichaelLCrick What is routine courtesy?  I can assure you that commenting on a friendly country's domestic politics is neither routine nor courteous.
1325393428696457217 2020-11-08 19:03:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jwbottomley @MichaelLCrick And we did congratulate Biden.  However, why conment on US domestic politics? It's none of our business.
1325386388410347521 2020-11-08 18:35:14 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TimW1901 @MichaelLCrick Do you think that someone who goes around mocking other people's intelligence (as you did with Raab) is secure?
1325386125054271488 2020-11-08 18:34:11 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TimW1901 @MichaelLCrick Wow! You can determine all that from a couple of tweets?   Are you Mystic Meg undercover as an internet troll?
1325385953079418882 2020-11-08 18:33:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TimW1901 @MichaelLCrick But it's good that you've admitted you're probably not blessed with a quick mind. That kind of humility is rare on Twitter.
1325385701215629312 2020-11-08 18:32:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TimW1901 @MichaelLCrick You're probably right. I have an MSc with distinction from a Russel Group university, but I wouldn't presume myself to be as intelligent as him.
1325384338226237440 2020-11-08 18:27:05 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TimW1901 @MichaelLCrick He's probably way brainer than you! 😂
1325384176925806592 2020-11-08 18:26:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MichaelLCrick He didn't want to wade into domestic US politics.  I'm sure the US Secretary of State would have done the same if asked about a contested election over here.
1325381377756434432 2020-11-08 18:15:19 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @RupertMyers If he says, 'yes', the follow up is 'what about votes received after polls close?'. If he says 'no', he'll be accused of being anti-democracy.  He wisely sidestepped the question, rather than wading into US politics
1325362230515408896 2020-11-08 16:59:14 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SarawakRajah @ni135790 @Lord_Sugar Think it through.

1325236835082264578 2020-11-08 08:40:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @FlutterbyIckle @Femi_Sorry @MarcusRashford I just hope that, when he's in his eighties, he doesn't look back and think 'what the fuck was I thinking? I could have had a partner and kids and a career, instead of being a paid propagandist, trying to appeal to morons'.
1325234952959569924 2020-11-08 08:33:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @MarcusRashford If only tweeting were yours...
1325234343741108224 2020-11-08 08:31:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @markbutchr @vince_rhodes @Femi_Sorry Tbh, you were going to write that however I replied, weren't you? 😂  I'm glad I didn't waste my time trying to engage seriously with you.  As for the Daily Mail, I've been too busy reading textbooks and academic papers, I'm afraid. Sorry if that challeges your stereotype.
1325232835792412672 2020-11-08 08:25:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @markbutchr @vince_rhodes @Femi_Sorry Google it. I'm not here to play silly games. Bye.

1325231892086599681 2020-11-08 08:21:19 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @blain321 @flameit @YvetteCooperMP @BorisJohnson I dunno. I reckon FBPE Richard from Twitter can do far better.
1325231616684339201 2020-11-08 08:20:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @flameit @YvetteCooperMP Why don't you show us how it should be done, and blow us away with what you would have written?
1325228599239172099 2020-11-08 08:08:14 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @vince_rhodes @Femi_Sorry What, every single one of the millions of us?
1325227704506064898 2020-11-08 08:04:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DawnButlerBrent @Twitter Did you stop to think how that might make people with real mental health issues feel?
1325043913976111109 2020-11-07 19:54:21 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @d_spiegel What are your thoughts on the alleged statistical anomalies in the US presidetial results?
1324866700970430464 2020-11-07 08:10:11 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @AdibaHaq1 @Femi_Sorry His self-image is not matched by his talent...
1324837771408715776 2020-11-07 06:15:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @proud_remoaner @Nigel_Farage Yeah, I can relate to that. I absolutely loved seeing you lot lose your minds when we left the EU. 😂
1324837069525581825 2020-11-07 06:12:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @woolseverywhere @AlStewartOBE @Twitter A very dignified comment, Benjamin.
1324764003709714434 2020-11-07 01:22:06 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @PoliticsWill_ @Femi_Sorry It wouldn't. It's just Femi being full of hyperbole as usual.

1324060764345454592 2020-11-05 02:47:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @CradleOfWilf @cheekyswinematt @Lordbrexit1 @Femi_Sorry I had a feeling that there was a tinge of sarcasm in your 'enlighten us' request, but I thought I'd give you the benefit of the doubt.   Anyway, you're welcome.
1324060598863364097 2020-11-05 02:47:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @CradleOfWilf @cheekyswinematt @Lordbrexit1 @Femi_Sorry You forgot to thank me for answering your question. Funny how people requesting information frequently do that.
1324055703586279426 2020-11-05 02:27:34 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @cheekyswinematt @CradleOfWilf @Lordbrexit1 @Femi_Sorry No, it's you who took the sarky tone. But the joke is on you. It's not the president's decision. End of.
1324055449025601537 2020-11-05 02:26:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @cheekyswinematt @grumpymol @CradleOfWilf @Lordbrexit1 @Femi_Sorry But the president isn't the gatekeeper. Congress is. So it's irrelevant.
1324054481026359296 2020-11-05 02:22:42 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @cheekyswinematt @CradleOfWilf @Lordbrexit1 @Femi_Sorry The same. Thanks.
1324001458040328192 2020-11-04 22:52:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @CradleOfWilf @Lordbrexit1 @Femi_Sorry Wilfred - The president doesn't rubber stamp trade deals. That falls to Congress. Hope that helps.
1323900998222577665 2020-11-04 16:12:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Independent He's still heavy favourite to keep the presidency, so I'm sure that fact consoles him.
1323898400329371648 2020-11-04 16:02:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @campbellclaret You can bet on Biden at 2-1 on Betfair.  If you're so sure, fill ypur boots!
1323872252555919366 2020-11-04 14:18:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry You ok, hun?
1323758794963386368 2020-11-04 06:47:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @talkRADIO @Iromg @TVKev @Emma_A_Webb What about your sponsors? Do they have the money?
1323733578975510532 2020-11-04 05:07:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @fosmar1982 Rent a gob - love it! 😅
1323730067390943234 2020-11-04 04:53:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @afneil @KayBurley Nice attempt at getting @afneil to pay you some attention, btw.  Do your sponsors pay you for stirring up s***?
1323729828202381312 2020-11-04 04:52:39 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @afneil @KayBurley I'm pretty sure you've also retweeted him. So by your own logic...
1323663933891366919 2020-11-04 00:30:48 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Miss_Snuffy Nail on the head
1323663400082264066 2020-11-04 00:28:41 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> Does anyone know who Femi's sponsors are?   I think the world needs to know who is paying for this.
1323613351960813570 2020-11-03 21:09:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @terrychristian I'm sure the millions of American fans of The Word will take note.
1323587580940615680 2020-11-03 19:27:25 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLammy Will you be his dance partner?
1323529336813735936 2020-11-03 15:35:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JacobBardenUK I wonder if @Femi_Sorry gets paid by how many comments he gets. It woukd explain a lot...
1323528691629129728 2020-11-03 15:33:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @LeylaRazavi @BBC @BBCNewsPR @AboutTheBBC @BBCNews Sure you did! 😂🤣😁🤣😅
1323372012040036359 2020-11-03 05:10:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @mangowhizz @DPJHodges @GaryLineker How do you know that?
1323362280738869249 2020-11-03 04:32:09 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @WCXXVI @wheatgermdust @DPJHodges @GaryLineker It's possible that could happen, sure, but do you really think that was the motivation? Honestly?
1323357866821144576 2020-11-03 04:14:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @WCXXVI @wheatgermdust @DPJHodges You have to wonder why @GaryLineker felt the need to tell the world about letting a stranger share his house for a fortnight, that's all.   Every day, millions of people do good deeds without telling anyone about them.
1323350157052792832 2020-11-03 03:43:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @wheatgermdust @WCXXVI @DPJHodges Quite. It's a bit like telling all your mates that you've donated money to a beggar, rather than keeping it to yourself.
1323243466147713027 2020-11-02 20:40:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @cossburn @cpeedell @MichaelYeadon3 @EstherMcVey1 No guessing about it. You are struggling big time.
1323214941982236673 2020-11-02 18:46:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @cossburn @cpeedell @MichaelYeadon3 @EstherMcVey1 Which bit are you struggling with? I'm guessing that English isn't your first language?
1323194129493512192 2020-11-02 17:23:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DPJHodges So it was probably basically a case of 'Hey @GaryLineker, we have this really polite, friendly guy. Would you mind if he crashes at yours fir a week or two?'.  Hardly a major sacrifice.
1323193578009579520 2020-11-02 17:21:47 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DPJHodges He took one alleged refugee for about a week.   And I have a suspicion that the guy he took wasn't chosen randomly.
1323191699875704833 2020-11-02 17:14:19 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @piersmorgan Isn't that sexist, Darling?
1323185726121562112 2020-11-02 16:50:35 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @gallonupper @cpeedell @CharlieSpicer5 @MichaelYeadon3 @EstherMcVey1 ???   No-one is denying that Covid exists and that some of its patients end up in ICU.
1323055017847410688 2020-11-02 08:11:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @cpeedell @MichaelYeadon3 @EstherMcVey1 Your hospital could have double that amount of CV19 patients. Without further context, it's meaningless.
1323054482708680705 2020-11-02 08:09:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @cpeedell @CharlieSpicer5 @MichaelYeadon3 @EstherMcVey1 So the shutters went down immediately, basically?  What if he's right? With the stakes so high, surely it's worth considering what he has to say, even if you think he's almost certainly wrong.
1323049657317105666 2020-11-02 07:49:54 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @cocoandboris I hope they merge.
1323049067627335683 2020-11-02 07:47:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MichaelYeadon3 So basically, the lockdown was possibly based on junk science?
1323037421123080192 2020-11-02 07:01:16 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @GiveUsAQuid @LisburneRoad Is he though? That's never been confirmed.
1323022895338135554 2020-11-02 06:03:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ddale8 @daveweigel Sean Connery has barely been dead a day, and already Trump is telling lies about him:  https://t.co/cCjWhwhfkk
1323022746259959808 2020-11-02 06:02:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @dannyjaymc @NicolaSturgeon Turns out it's bull:  https://t.co/cCjWhwhfkk  Quel surprise.
1322946021043875849 2020-11-02 00:58:05 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @piersmorgan @GMB @BorisJohnson No, you banned them! Remember?
1322944236032065536 2020-11-02 00:50:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ddale8 Have you seen his tweet about the late Sir Sean Connery?  Reeks of bs...
1322915793986867205 2020-11-01 22:57:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Who? Your boss Soros?
1322901702081728514 2020-11-01 22:01:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @realDonaldTrump Hey @NicolaSturgeon. Did it really happen like that? 🤔
1322899871179952128 2020-11-01 21:54:42 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ClarkeMicah Not least @piersmorgan, who prefers shouting and name calling to calm, forensic analysis.
1322892790385332224 2020-11-01 21:26:34 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Maybe the universe is trying to tell you something.
1322881672715665410 2020-11-01 20:42:23 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @LozzaFox @piersmorgan Such grace and dignity. You are a true inspiration.
1322859538576494595 2020-11-01 19:14:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jessphillips Did you read through ones where there was a male victim?  The reason I ask is that you don't seem to take male victims of domestic violence very seriously.
1322659178750615552 2020-11-01 05:58:16 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @AlStewartOBE @NHSuk Sorry for your loss.   Do you also blame the BLM protestors, who thought that it was OK to put British public safety at risk in order to protest about George Floyd's killing?
1322658039409889281 2020-11-01 05:53:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @JamesCleverly Femi, have you thought of selling your own range of t-shirts?
1322618457062580228 2020-11-01 03:16:27 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @LittleAJ79 Sorry for your loss.
1322605000594477056 2020-11-01 02:22:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @Bankersbonus1 They learn from the best.
1322591231281680384 2020-11-01 01:28:16 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DPJHodges Will he call it an Australian style set of measures?
1322589062486806529 2020-11-01 01:19:39 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @markfcrypto @vanillabeanryan I thought you'd muted me! 😂
1322588930215235585 2020-11-01 01:19:08 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @AlStewartOBE Do you think that's the reason for the delay, as opposed to thrashing out all the details before making a public statement?
1322585499039600640 2020-11-01 01:05:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @vanillabeanryan @markfcrypto @AlStewartOBE 'people like John' - That kind of implies that you are in someway superior to people who share my view and I, does it not?
1322584624699236358 2020-11-01 01:02:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @markfcrypto I think you are being dishonest, absolutely. Bye.
1322584353680039937 2020-11-01 01:00:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @vanillabeanryan @markfcrypto @AlStewartOBE Don't assume that the people who disagree with you are similar, or that they are less intelligent than you.   Both of those assumptions may be false, and it may be you who is deluded.
1322584110209052672 2020-11-01 00:59:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @markfcrypto No. You're not seeking knowledge, you're seeking an argument. Bye.
1322581742847483904 2020-11-01 00:50:34 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @markfcrypto @vanillabeanryan @AlStewartOBE Oh, for the love of ...   Re-read my tweet.  These 'so what you're saying is' comments aren't very clever.
1322581462311411716 2020-11-01 00:49:27 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Gosh, that was a mouthful!   You need to get a girlfriend, mate.
1322581326055251969 2020-11-01 00:48:55 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @MaxTundra @DAaronovitch If my aunt had balls she'd be my uncle.
1322581106907074560 2020-11-01 00:48:02 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @DavidRu00626482 Very topical tweet Femi.
1322580971800219648 2020-11-01 00:47:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Mate, you can say it till you're blue in the face. Your protestations will change absolutely nothing.
1322580862064615424 2020-11-01 00:47:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @mitsyarty It's always the other guy who is the propagandist, eh Femi?
1322580303756595202 2020-11-01 00:44:51 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @markfcrypto @vanillabeanryan @AlStewartOBE Go into a busy supermarket, observe what you see, and then let's compare notes.
1322580168196661251 2020-11-01 00:44:19 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @markfcrypto @vanillabeanryan @AlStewartOBE Observation
1322578871863119874 2020-11-01 00:39:10 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @vanillabeanryan @AlStewartOBE Then you are in a small minority, I would hazard.
1322560409216442370 2020-10-31 23:25:48 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @emilyhewertson I didn't know she even read messages from us plebs! 😂
1322471913197887490 2020-10-31 17:34:09 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @bowenja @PrisonPlanet Which ones?
1322333076454842369 2020-10-31 08:22:27 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @grahammahony @Thenew84 @officialbarnesy Source? That's a hell of a claim.
1322332705737134081 2020-10-31 08:20:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> Imagine the outcry from the media if a white ex England &amp; Liverpool player had written this about black people.  As things are, crickets.
1322321298765303808 2020-10-31 07:35:39 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @peteaustin6 @AlStewartOBE @thetimes @DailyMailUK Yes. Although many people find the restrictions revolting, polls suggest that most people support them. I think this is cynical Blair style 'policy making by focus group' politics.
1322320493467389957 2020-10-31 07:32:27 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Fionape30319092 @spectator Yes. Now go bed and stop talking rubbish, young man.
1322318995559751680 2020-10-31 07:26:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Fionape30319092 @spectator It's not been officially confirmed.  So calm down. :)
1322318425230856193 2020-10-31 07:24:14 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @mickyhall46 @BrettEverest You're conflating unrelated things.  There is no reason why I can't dislike the protests and enjoy a holiday somewhere in France far away from where they are happening.
1322312122823512065 2020-10-31 06:59:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @RSwanson_UK @Independent Get a job at the dole office.   I believe they are having a recruitment drive.
1322311724511494152 2020-10-31 06:57:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @AlStewartOBE @thetimes @DailyMailUK In your experience as a journalist, is it common for governments to engage in such tactics?
1322305793178427392 2020-10-31 06:34:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @guesser @Nigel_Farage At what odds?
1322254314631536643 2020-10-31 03:09:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @drphilhammond Why doesn't he just buy a washable cloth mask, which is arguably more comfortable anyway?
1322253389321875456 2020-10-31 03:05:48 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @terrychristian @officialbarnesy Maybe you can explain it then, because I interpreted it literally and thought it was a tad racist.
1322253086396682241 2020-10-31 03:04:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @drphilhammond Apparently viruses don't need oxygen to survive -  https://t.co/k19R6K9LWb - so I'm not sure this would kill any viruses that might be lurking in the mask?
1322249176550383616 2020-10-31 02:49:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @officialbarnesy Hey @DavidLammy. Will you condemn this shocking racism from a role model?
1322154313087672321 2020-10-30 20:32:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ProfKarolSikora I have a small lump beneath my right earlobe. Following your advice, I rang my surgery. There are no face to face appointments, and the earliest phone consultation is Tuesday.   I'm not sure how I'm going to describe a lump I can't even see!   Utterly ridiculous.
1322151898154229761 2020-10-30 20:22:31 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DawnButlerBrent @UKYP @BrentYP That sounds very vain and egotistical. Why not instead take the opportunity to thank the hard working people who have made those achievements possible, instead of wallowing in self-glory?
1322144064536481792 2020-10-30 19:51:23 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @piersmorgan I'm pretty sure that taxi drivers in other places have been known to do that.
1322143282470768640 2020-10-30 19:48:17 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @IsabelOakeshott @bbcquestiontime How dare they not agree with the mighty Femi? 😡
1321963683677937666 2020-10-30 07:54:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @simon4124 @NazShahBfd And let's not forget the fact that a woman's word in a sharia court is worth half a man's.
1321962173011316738 2020-10-30 07:48:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ClarkeMicah @piersmorgan I think Piers is too emotional to weigh things up rationally (which is also why he published those fake torture pics without first doing a bit of critical thinking).   Classic hothead.
1321951245830135809 2020-10-30 07:05:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Tweeet_Book @Femi_Sorry Don't say stuff like that right before I go to bed - you'll give me nightmares! 😂  Can you imagine Femi hosting a press conference wearing one of his trademark t-shirts? 😂
1321941568874577922 2020-10-30 06:26:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @officialbarnesy You are a role model, so it's concerning that you are arguing against reading.
1321941335264342016 2020-10-30 06:25:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @officialbarnesy Read widely and form your opinions based on a variety of sources.  The examples you cite are extreme. I studied anthropology at uni and never came across tuat theory.
1321931654517149696 2020-10-30 05:47:21 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @OneHourEdit @DonkeyThotAy @Femi_Sorry @UKLabour I'll take my Masters with distinction over Femi's 2:2
1321931420403748864 2020-10-30 05:46:25 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @OneHourEdit @DonkeyThotAy @Femi_Sorry @UKLabour Clearly.  Quite presumptuous, aren't we? 😂
1321920675968438284 2020-10-30 05:03:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Independent Only none of the statements are racist. 🤔
1321920156810043392 2020-10-30 05:01:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @OneHourEdit @DonkeyThotAy @Femi_Sorry @UKLabour I think that we hope that we will eventually educate him, yet he keeps churning out the same half baked nonsense! 🤣
1321838374706126848 2020-10-29 23:36:41 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Independent 😂
1321837981775310848 2020-10-29 23:35:08 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @dickiegarvey @Femi_Sorry Maybe see if @owenjones84 can put in a good word for you. Oh, wait...
1321830268496470017 2020-10-29 23:04:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @greasystrangla @Femi_Sorry @BalancePowerUK I hope he's being ironic, though self-deprecation isn't his style.
1321829295518556161 2020-10-29 23:00:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @BalancePowerUK Did you ever get your Labour membership reinstated? 🤔
1321759897659297792 2020-10-29 18:24:51 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SukiStockwell @IsabelOakeshott @Femi_Sorry But he doesn't. He really doesn't.   He spews out half baked distortions, like the other day when he was kicking off about the pound dropping (even though it had risen again by the time he tweeted).
1321759582071513088 2020-10-29 18:23:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @MakeVotesMatter No.  I voted UKIP back in the year when they got something like 15% of the votes, yet just 1 or 2 MPs.  Yet the SNP get loads of seats relative to their share of the UK vote.  It sucks, doesn't it?
1321733464333389825 2020-10-29 16:39:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLammy Like Blair did?
1321709737046609920 2020-10-29 15:05:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLammy I thought you were talking about @Keir_Starmer and @angelarayner for a second!
1321561053638086656 2020-10-29 05:14:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HoohaAboutMaths @Chalky1958 @presterjohn1165 @DawnButlerBrent We're going around in circles here I'm out.
1321560942119915522 2020-10-29 05:14:16 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HoohaAboutMaths @Chalky1958 @presterjohn1165 @DawnButlerBrent That's like saying 'men do murder'.  Yes, some do, but we can't judge them all by the actions of a tiny minority.
1321560384457871360 2020-10-29 05:12:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HoohaAboutMaths @Chalky1958 @presterjohn1165 @DawnButlerBrent No we don't! 😂
1321560144107458560 2020-10-29 05:11:06 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HoohaAboutMaths @Chalky1958 @presterjohn1165 @DawnButlerBrent Mate, you're grasping at straws.  You may think there is some grand cover up, but there is zero evidence of that, or of racial profiling.  Dawn put 2 and 2 together and got 5, and many people blindly accepted her logic.
1321559524701097985 2020-10-29 05:08:38 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JamesCleverly @WFP When will you be posting about inspiring male humanitarians? 🤔
1321559277165826049 2020-10-29 05:07:39 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @JamesCleverly @WFP Would you prefer those jobs to go to other countries? 🤔
1321559067849052162 2020-10-29 05:06:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Chalky1958 @HoohaAboutMaths @presterjohn1165 @DawnButlerBrent Correct. And from Dawn's footage, the guy has a pretty light complexion.
1321512593647947782 2020-10-29 02:02:09 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper And you have to wonder how randomly those 5 were selected.   Regardless, it's a statistically meaningless sample size.
1321507321290366982 2020-10-29 01:41:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HoohaAboutMaths @Chalky1958 @presterjohn1165 @DawnButlerBrent The evidence was reviewed. The officers were found innocent of wrongdoing.  Time for Dawn to apologise and for the 'maybe the cops were racist' folk to move on.
1321496962047348737 2020-10-29 01:00:02 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ianmayo @gouldina @IsabelOakeshott @Femi_Sorry Are you trying to be unpleasant or do you just lack self awareness?
1321486793070546944 2020-10-29 00:19:38 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BoltonBarnet @AdamPrint3 @Independent If that's all you have to throw at me, you're out of arguments.  You could have conceded a bit more gracefully, but hey, this is Twitter.  Anyone, fun as your posts about dildos are, I'm going to mute you. Bye.
1321486354585473029 2020-10-29 00:17:53 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BoltonBarnet @Independent @DavidLammy For someone who's not offended, you spit out quite a lot of bile!   Melt! 😅
1321486186834239490 2020-10-29 00:17:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BoltonBarnet @AdamPrint3 @Independent It doesn't though.  You obviously think the average viewer is far less intelligent than you and can't see that.
1321485433218498560 2020-10-29 00:14:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BoltonBarnet @33Skorrie @Independent Classy. What a way to maintain the moral high ground.
1321485158239842305 2020-10-29 00:13:08 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BoltonBarnet @Independent @DavidLammy Translation: Your view offends me.  Good. Does it offend you because I'm wrong or because I might be right?
1321483014740844544 2020-10-29 00:04:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HeHasHeard @julierfourteen @_davelv @IsabelOakeshott @Femi_Sorry @jeremycorbyn I know. I had to write loads of them in my dissertation.   I'm guessing you mainly encounter paragraphs in the Sun?
1321473218742489088 2020-10-28 23:25:41 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HeHasHeard @julierfourteen @_davelv @IsabelOakeshott @Femi_Sorry @jeremycorbyn On the contrary, he gifted the Tories 2 general elections. For that, I will be forever grateful.
1321473075213438977 2020-10-28 23:25:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry You are getting paid by the tweet, right?  Nothing else can explain this level of rubbish output!
1321462285672525827 2020-10-28 22:42:15 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @IsabelOakeshott Classy, Femi.  Classy.  Do you not realise that the approach you advocate may not be the one that saves most lives?
1321453118987608064 2020-10-28 22:05:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @_davelv @IsabelOakeshott @Femi_Sorry @jeremycorbyn Thankfully, no.
1321453013177958403 2020-10-28 22:05:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @julierfourteen @HeHasHeard @_davelv @IsabelOakeshott @Femi_Sorry @jeremycorbyn He won't like it because it's totally irrelevant.
1321452819568824322 2020-10-28 22:04:38 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BoltonBarnet @Independent It is you who is being the dullard, my friend.  Comic Relief isn't a National Geographic documentary. It's about raising money for impoverished people who are incapable of lifting themselves out of their situation.   This has made that harder. I hope @DavidLammy feels proud
1321452239429447685 2020-10-28 22:02:19 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Thank you for sharing that. Most interesting.   Do you get paid by the tweet?
1321411281560260610 2020-10-28 19:19:34 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @kanjer52 @andreinawie Come on man.  No-one deserves to be sexually harassed.
1321408672644386817 2020-10-28 19:09:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DuncanBannatyne Also, I like hands-on MPs, who are willing to leave their ivory tower and fight battles for their constituents.
1321407861956763649 2020-10-28 19:05:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DuncanBannatyne That £100 might be the difference between the constituent paying their rent or not.
1321407321755570177 2020-10-28 19:03:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HoohaAboutMaths @presterjohn1165 @DawnButlerBrent Incorrect.   She accused the police of racial profiling.
1321407073335345155 2020-10-28 19:02:51 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DuncanBannatyne You have not explained the situation.  All we know is that an MP is helping a constituent take on a business in the small claims court.  Without knowing more, it's impossible to make a judgement on whether they should be doing that.
1321403458084360192 2020-10-28 18:48:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DukeofGlamis @HeHasHeard @_davelv @IsabelOakeshott @Femi_Sorry @jeremycorbyn Totally
1321403095105110017 2020-10-28 18:47:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @FNC_Jobby2 @DuncanBannatyne They could, but what if I suffer from anxiety and want someone there with me in court. My MP supports my case and wants to help out a constituent. I don't see the problem.
1321402647979720709 2020-10-28 18:45:16 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HoohaAboutMaths @presterjohn1165 @DawnButlerBrent And found no evidence of wrongdoing.  That should have been swiftly followed by an apology from Dawn.
1321402340067467270 2020-10-28 18:44:02 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DuncanBannatyne Again, what are the details?  If my MP witnesses a company flytipping in my front yard, and I want to sue them, would it be wrong for him to write an witness statement attesting to that?
1321401688893390849 2020-10-28 18:41:27 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HoohaAboutMaths @DawnButlerBrent @MPFed Dawn's was edited, for a start! 😂  Body cam footage would show the chain of events, including the conversation between the copper prior to pulling Dawn's car over (and I'd bet good money that the word 'black' isn't said once).
1321401028760248320 2020-10-28 18:38:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @FNC_Jobby2 @DuncanBannatyne You may need the civil service to provide evidence relevant to the claim.
1321400583157329922 2020-10-28 18:37:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DuncanBannatyne I've acknowledged that it depends on the case. Some cases are frivilous, others deserving.   Maybe if you provide more details, we can make our minds up?
1321399916011393024 2020-10-28 18:34:25 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HoohaAboutMaths @presterjohn1165 @DawnButlerBrent That is pure speculation.  Let's say the dashcam shows that the police knew the driver was black (unlikely). That doesn't remotely provide a racial motive for the stop.
1321399423864344582 2020-10-28 18:32:27 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HoohaAboutMaths @DawnButlerBrent Hey @MPFed. Can you answer this?   I'm guessing it's because either there was no dashboard footage or because the bodycam footage was far more revealing, but hopefully you can satisfy this guy.
1321398407014088704 2020-10-28 18:28:25 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DuncanBannatyne @scotgov Surely it depends on the case. Some companies may deserve to be sued.  What case are you referring to?
1321397602907291651 2020-10-28 18:25:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HoohaAboutMaths @presterjohn1165 @DawnButlerBrent On the topic of unreleased evidence, why do you think that Ms Butler hasn't released the full, unedited version of her own footage? 🤔
1321397058155282432 2020-10-28 18:23:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HoohaAboutMaths @presterjohn1165 @DawnButlerBrent Because the powers that be don't want to cteate a shitstorm would be my guess.
1321392991735582721 2020-10-28 18:06:54 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BritishInstitu8 @_davelv @IsabelOakeshott @Femi_Sorry @jeremycorbyn And not relevant to this discussion.
1321392885686771712 2020-10-28 18:06:28 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HeHasHeard @_davelv @IsabelOakeshott @Femi_Sorry @jeremycorbyn Irrelevant. The fact that she spent more than he'd promised to shows she put a huge sum of money in.
1321392658858868736 2020-10-28 18:05:34 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BritishInstitu8 @cbignell11 @IsabelOakeshott @Femi_Sorry @BorisJohnson You don't think what happens on social media influences public opinion, which in turn influences political decisions?
1321391952802336769 2020-10-28 18:02:46 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HoohaAboutMaths @DawnButlerBrent Seeing as the car windows were reportedly blacked out, making the race of the driver impossible to determine, I would say 'no'.
1321390038882635778 2020-10-28 17:55:10 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @_davelv @IsabelOakeshott @Femi_Sorry You're aware that Theresa May put more money into the NHS than @jeremycorbyn had promised to?
1321389799920541696 2020-10-28 17:54:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @cbignell11 @IsabelOakeshott @Femi_Sorry @BorisJohnson Yeah, but propagandists like Femi make it easier for him.
1321388950343344128 2020-10-28 17:50:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @IsabelOakeshott @Femi_Sorry Good luck getting a reply. Femi is a propagandist - he doesn't do logical debate.
1321388070747471872 2020-10-28 17:47:20 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BoltonBarnet @Independent No they aren't, but if they raise money for Africa, who cares?
1321387880397373441 2020-10-28 17:46:35 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Independent Well done @DavidLammy.  You've deprived a worthy cause of money.
1321387044455780352 2020-10-28 17:43:16 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HoohaAboutMaths @DawnButlerBrent I don't know. Ask them.
1321384135567544320 2020-10-28 17:31:42 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JuneSim63 @DawnButlerBrent Yes, because everyone who disagrees with her must be a bot. There can be no other logical explanation.
1321383821569384448 2020-10-28 17:30:27 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HoohaAboutMaths @DawnButlerBrent Ms Brent says she wants them to.  So do the officers.  Maybe her friend, the driver, objects to the footage being released.
1321382911996821504 2020-10-28 17:26:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BigDave14569376 No they don't. Sending unsolicited intimate pics is sexual harassment and a criminal offence. It's no different to flashing at someone in real life. It can make women feel uncomfortable and unsafe. It's totally inappropriate.  @MetCC @metpoliceuk @policescotland
1321376813873090561 2020-10-28 17:02:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BigDave14569376 Hey @MetCC. This guy keeps sending women penis pics. Can you do something about it? @metpoliceuk @policescotland
1321375636255084545 2020-10-28 16:57:56 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DawnButlerBrent This is the sort of thing we need to guard against.  Police need to be able to do tjeir job without worrying about racism allegations.   https://t.co/ADYHApFUFi
1321375174030217221 2020-10-28 16:56:06 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MrHarryCole Heartbreaking.
1321374916080533507 2020-10-28 16:55:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Independent Thanks Independent. I love reading about the political views of soap stars.
1321373837779521539 2020-10-28 16:50:47 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DawnButlerBrent Yesterday, we heard that a security guard didn't challenge the Manchester bomber for fear of being called racist.  Do tweets like yours above not risk the police not doing their job properly in case they are called racist?
1321372788670738432 2020-10-28 16:46:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DawnButlerBrent Speaking of which, how is the bodycam footage request coming along?
1321170158581415938 2020-10-28 03:21:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> And Jesus wept.
1321166756375920640 2020-10-28 03:07:55 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> Hey @NicolaSturgeon. So pubs in Tier 3 areas can open but not serve alcohol?   Does the virus get bored and go elsewhere if there is no beer to be drunk?   https://t.co/2i1OWgbeoq
1321124456874577923 2020-10-28 00:19:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BigDave14569376 @andreinawie Dave - I mean this sincerely. Get some professional help. That kind of behaviour isn't normal. See a doctor.

1321118664746246144 2020-10-27 23:56:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JuliaHB1 They secretly do too.
1321074052006629380 2020-10-27 20:59:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jessphillips Didn't know you were a fan of tough punishment.  I had you down as a defund the police supporter.
1321039877434232832 2020-10-27 18:43:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @AlStewartOBE You seem to be advocating emotional manipulation by the media?
1321020447685828608 2020-10-27 17:26:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Waveydavey32 @Paul_B_Hopkins @afneil Then they need educating about databases. :)
1321012915248517120 2020-10-27 16:56:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Paul_B_Hopkins @afneil Yeah, but whoever decided to use an Excel spreadsheet in a 17 million person database is also pretty incompetant.
1321012437047455746 2020-10-27 16:54:42 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @afneil I'd love to know how that money equates to 'cost per hour worked'.  I bet about £179 million is pure profit.
1320819191176482819 2020-10-27 04:06:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @oxlonger_mike @dbvl53 @AdamChalkley84 @LozzaFox Indeed. An apology on Twitter is almost as rare as rocking horse ****! :)

1320798753067044873 2020-10-27 02:45:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @AdamChalkley84 @dbvl53 @LozzaFox Ever hear of projection?   From your photo, you look like the soft, sensitive type yourself.
1320798473843867649 2020-10-27 02:44:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @macca_new @stevetoy @AdamChalkley84 @LozzaFox Wow! Now that was witty. Have you ever thought of becoming a comedian?
1320798294172422146 2020-10-27 02:43:47 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @AdamChalkley84 @LozzaFox This isn't the school playground. Ffs, grow up.
1320755397188345856 2020-10-26 23:53:19 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @LeeCorby4 @DawnButlerBrent @metpoliceuk Les, because everyone to the right of Lee from Twitter is a foaming at the mouth fascist.
1320740092009394179 2020-10-26 22:52:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @LeeCorby4 @DawnButlerBrent @metpoliceuk Well virtue signalled! 🤩  Here, have a gold star for effort young man.
1320739780632653824 2020-10-26 22:51:16 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DawnButlerBrent @metpoliceuk I look forward to seeing the body cam footage. How's that request coming along?
1320720896861085697 2020-10-26 21:36:14 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Put a note in the diary to buy yourself some humble pie in the first week of the New Year.  You'll be eating it like it's going out of fashion.
1320713017475162118 2020-10-26 21:04:55 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> Hey @BootsUK.  How much profit are you making on a £120 Covid test?
1320690650615029760 2020-10-26 19:36:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DamianClough2 @Femi_Sorry Femi is not always polite! He can be a condescending git! 😂
1320521191203966977 2020-10-26 08:22:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Tweeet_Book @Femi_Sorry I'd love to know where Femi gets his shirts from. 😂
1320485958932975624 2020-10-26 06:02:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @PointlessBrexit @JuliaHB1 Hey @metpoliceuk. Has a crime been committed with this tweet? It looks like incitement to me.
1320485387807137797 2020-10-26 06:00:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JuliaHB1 @TwitterSupport Hey @MetCC. Has a crime been committed?
1320455665614245888 2020-10-26 04:02:18 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @booshie124 My problem is that only an idiot would consider an entire race of peoplè to be an enemy.  There are good and bad people in every race and religion.
1320443499154706434 2020-10-26 03:13:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @booshie124 What kind of question is that???  I don't consider any of them my enemy, period.
1320432712738627586 2020-10-26 02:31:05 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JuliaHB1 @TwitterSupport Well. @jack?
1320404534255112192 2020-10-26 00:39:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Andy72726059 @Femi_Sorry Now that's a very interesting question.  It's one of the mysteries of our time, but rumour has it that it's a guy whose name rhymes with Sore Ass.
1320359605042630658 2020-10-25 21:40:35 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @MarcusRashford Maybe you could take a leaf out of his book and do something more useful than endlessly tweeting propaganda.
1320321565565779972 2020-10-25 19:09:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @CluelessTories @Femi_Sorry No.   We want it to be taught as a contentious theory, not an established fact.
1320320011706290176 2020-10-25 19:03:15 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MarkP7803 @Femi_Sorry @pritipatel @BimAfolami See the context:  https://t.co/OFwLyUb22F  Then come back if you have any further questions.
1320319654154407939 2020-10-25 19:01:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @FOILondon @TheDogsDinner2 @Femi_Sorry @DisraeliRascal @pritipatel @BimAfolami That doesn't follow logically, and I think you know that and are being deliberately obtuse.   You just don't want to acknowledge that Femi was distorting Johnson's words to score political points and please his paymasters.
1320318370718298116 2020-10-25 18:56:44 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @FOILondon @TheDogsDinner2 @Femi_Sorry @DisraeliRascal @pritipatel @BimAfolami OK, but can we at least agree that Femi mischievously distorted Boris's words?
1320317933793542145 2020-10-25 18:55:00 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TheDogsDinner2 @FOILondon @Femi_Sorry @DisraeliRascal @pritipatel @BimAfolami This isn't the playground. If you're just going to insult me, you're wasting my time. Muted. Bye.
1320317816860528642 2020-10-25 18:54:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MarkP7803 @DisraeliRascal @Femi_Sorry @pritipatel @BimAfolami I think all he was saying was that Uganda has suffered since the end of British rule.   He is not advocating a return to British rule. Just better governance.
1320316180167643137 2020-10-25 18:48:02 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DisraeliRascal @TheDogsDinner2 @Femi_Sorry @pritipatel @BimAfolami 'The best fate for Africa would be if the old colonial powers, or their citizens, scrambled once again in her direction' -   Meaning 'go to Africa on holiday', not 'take her over'!  😂
1320315846498156545 2020-10-25 18:46:42 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @FOILondon @Femi_Sorry @DisraeliRascal @pritipatel @BimAfolami Again, that's gut reaction, not considered analysis.  Try, as an intellectual exercise, arguing a case for the things Boris was saying. It might help you see this from another perspective.   But the fact is that Femi was distorting was Boris was saying. Do you accept that?
1320315073525649408 2020-10-25 18:43:38 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @FOILondon @TheDogsDinner2 @Femi_Sorry @DisraeliRascal @pritipatel @BimAfolami Translation: I disagree with the sentiments of the article and they offend me.  That's great, you're entitled to your opinion, but I think you're allowing your revulsion to close your mind.
1320314846957703169 2020-10-25 18:42:44 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TheDogsDinner2 @Femi_Sorry @DisraeliRascal @pritipatel @BimAfolami But it seems you are interested in insult, not discussion, so bye.
1320314788090728448 2020-10-25 18:42:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TheDogsDinner2 @Femi_Sorry @DisraeliRascal @pritipatel @BimAfolami It's the same article. Read the last sentence in the article. Look familiar?
1320313905189736448 2020-10-25 18:38:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jayoluf @Femi_Sorry @pritipatel @BimAfolami  https://t.co/OFwLyUb22F  See for yourself. Look at the comments in context.

1320313052353433600 2020-10-25 18:35:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @DisraeliRascal @pritipatel @BimAfolami Why don't you post a link to the whole article, not just out of context quotes?
1320312690913497088 2020-10-25 18:34:10 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jayoluf @Femi_Sorry @pritipatel @BimAfolami Rubbish.  Femi is making stuff up.
1320312549213163521 2020-10-25 18:33:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DisraeliRascal @Femi_Sorry @pritipatel @BimAfolami It didn't.  He didn't.  #FakeNews
1320312253980250115 2020-10-25 18:32:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @pritipatel @BimAfolami Fake news. And you know it's fake news.
1320308308536971265 2020-10-25 18:16:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BaqueHime Interesting. @jessphillips acts like a fishwife, yet was born with a silver spoon in her mouth. 🤔
1320304996206989312 2020-10-25 18:03:35 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @allisonpearson Funny how @piersmorgan went ape over the excess deaths in previous months, but he's really quiet about this.
1320291283643092998 2020-10-25 17:09:06 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DawnButlerBrent @kinkswaugh Hey @BreitbartLondon. Seen this sexism by a Labour MP?   CC: @RaheemKassam @LozzaFox @Fox_Claire @afneil @ClarkeMicah
1320130238353989639 2020-10-25 06:29:10 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @cassalyn01 @LBC @DavidLammy Yeah, no-one saw that coming! 😂
1320106995643486208 2020-10-25 04:56:48 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> Hey @GarethSouthgate  Please, please make this guy the next England captain.
1320104235892080646 2020-10-25 04:45:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @LordJolemai @CorbynistaTeen I'd go for Java, Python or C#, but each to their own. :)
1320104030799003648 2020-10-25 04:45:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @CorbynistaTeen Java  I know you were talking about human languages, not computer ones, but in the current economic climate, I reckon Java will get you much further.
1320023633780264962 2020-10-24 23:25:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @kraker2k @JohnnyMercerUK Yes, because that wasn't the best way to help those kids.
1320018715866529795 2020-10-24 23:06:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @RSwanson_UK @SkySports Perhaps, but the fact that they had £12 billion lying about to produce a track and trace app that a bunch of computing students could have done as a group project suggests that they aren't short of money. :)
1320006443777609728 2020-10-24 22:17:15 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JonnyBorders @JonathanSGlass @Practical_Phil Not much gets past you! 😂
1320003894395756544 2020-10-24 22:07:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JonnyBorders @JonathanSGlass @Practical_Phil Wow! Jonny diving in with the sarcasm to defend people on £100k. I'm guessing he must be a die hard Tory. 🤔
1319992926005567489 2020-10-24 21:23:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @theLewisbell @alexevans26 @jeremycorbyn 😂 Tell that to a pub landlord who is barely keeping his head above water!
1319965553835073536 2020-10-24 19:34:46 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ActualKahuna @antihero_kate Nor do women who commit domestic violence.
1319960379888467968 2020-10-24 19:14:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @AFoxApc @Miss_Snuffy I think this is one of many ways in which the left have hijacked the English language.
1319958052964093953 2020-10-24 19:04:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @LordJolemai @jrc1921 Your ignorance is stunning.
1319955214603067392 2020-10-24 18:53:41 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Miss_Snuffy What advice would you give if a pupil told you they wanted to change their sex because they felt they were in the wrong body?
1319954562304872449 2020-10-24 18:51:05 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Miss_Snuffy What aspects of teacher training do you feel are damaging? Genuine question.
1319952799556403200 2020-10-24 18:44:05 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Andywelsh777 @buzzin2020 @Femi_Sorry I was enjoying our debate till you resorted to cheap personal insults.  Kinder, gentler politics. 😂  Muted. Bye.
1319951191477018625 2020-10-24 18:37:42 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Andywelsh777 @LDFJY @Iliveinafield @Femi_Sorry You are obviously way more trusting than me!
1319950814077739009 2020-10-24 18:36:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Andywelsh777 @LDFJY @Iliveinafield @Femi_Sorry Great. Use your local library.
1319949692751532032 2020-10-24 18:31:44 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @buzzin2020 @Andywelsh777 @Femi_Sorry Agreed. That's the sobering reality.
1319947395631808512 2020-10-24 18:22:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @LDFJY @Andywelsh777 @Iliveinafield @Femi_Sorry No it isn't.  What if only a small proportion of fraud is detected?
1319947248441167872 2020-10-24 18:22:02 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @LDFJY @Andywelsh777 @Iliveinafield @Femi_Sorry I need water to survive.  I remember doing fine without the internet in the early 90s.  Ergo your argument is ridiculous.
1319946755774029824 2020-10-24 18:20:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @LDFJY @Andywelsh777 @Iliveinafield @Femi_Sorry But what if it's not a small minority?  Also, there is always help available.
1319946479671349251 2020-10-24 18:18:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Independent For the love of God! This guy cleatly knows nothing about betting! 😂  It's people like him who make bookies rich.
1319945713778855936 2020-10-24 18:15:56 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TartanTory @Lordbrexit1 @Femi_Sorry @BorisJohnson You sure?   I live in Glasgow and pay £100 a month council tax. And I live in a nice part of town (Hillhead).
1319944961471774720 2020-10-24 18:12:56 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @harman_geoff Maybe the gammon finds you amusing.  Or maybe he's just more interested in alternative opinions than you are.
1319942348265095168 2020-10-24 18:02:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JamesWoods84 @harman_geoff @Femi_Sorry @JamesWood24 Then they should lose their license to trade.
1319941686731177986 2020-10-24 17:59:56 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Alwaleed_Talal @Kingdom_KHC Are you proud of its human rights record?
1319940745411907585 2020-10-24 17:56:11 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Andywelsh777 @buzzin2020 @Femi_Sorry Inequality is a byproduct of a thriving economy. Hard working entrepreneurs will thrive and become wealthy.  If people who are poorer wish to improve their lot, they have the opportunity to do so. It's up to them.
1319939888058433537 2020-10-24 17:52:47 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Andywelsh777 @LDFJY @Iliveinafield @Femi_Sorry Btw, the internet is a luxury (and you can use free wifi in plenty of places).
1319939698953945089 2020-10-24 17:52:02 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Andywelsh777 @LDFJY @Iliveinafield @Femi_Sorry I'd find a way.   And I'm pretty sure that figure is incorrect.
1319939139471609859 2020-10-24 17:49:48 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @LDFJY @Andywelsh777 @Iliveinafield @Femi_Sorry But they clearly can.   Some choose not to.
1319938909170786309 2020-10-24 17:48:53 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Andywelsh777 @buzzin2020 @Femi_Sorry Mrs Thatcher saved this country from the mess created by failed socialist policies in the 1970s.
1319937785248309248 2020-10-24 17:44:25 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Andywelsh777 @buzzin2020 @Femi_Sorry Alternatively, we could do what Mrs Thatcher did, and revitalise the economy by vastly reducing state subsidies.
1319935898604179457 2020-10-24 17:36:56 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Andywelsh777 @buzzin2020 @Femi_Sorry Maybe there would be fewer children born into poverty if people were forced to take personal responsibility for their decisions to a greater degree.
1319935224260812800 2020-10-24 17:34:15 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Andywelsh777 @buzzin2020 @Femi_Sorry Again, what's your better alternative?  Give everyone £300 a week plus rent and bills paid?  If you did that, everyone would try to get fired so they could live the life of Riley!
1319934275551199232 2020-10-24 17:30:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Andywelsh777 @buzzin2020 @Femi_Sorry What's your better alternative?  Let's say you pay people enough to live a comfortable life on the dole.  Why would anyone ever bother working? 😂
1319933062327787521 2020-10-24 17:25:39 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @harman_geoff @Femi_Sorry ???  I didn't say that.  And it's not a case of punishing the children.  If the parents won't feed their kids, then social services need to intervene.   Making cheap food like a stew costs pennies.
1319931635400364032 2020-10-24 17:19:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Andywelsh777 @buzzin2020 @Femi_Sorry You can get a 700 quid loan prior to it being processed.
1319930119075614720 2020-10-24 17:13:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Andywelsh777 @Iliveinafield @Femi_Sorry Alternatively, if parents can't afford to raise their kids, you could put the kids with a foster family who can afford to do so.
1319929340008800256 2020-10-24 17:10:52 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Andywelsh777 @Femi_Sorry It's not a case of punishing anyone.  It's about avoiding a benefits culture.  If people can't afford to care for their kids, it's not the state's responsibility to do it for them.
1319928274907238401 2020-10-24 17:06:38 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Andywelsh777 @Iliveinafield @Femi_Sorry If you are overly generous with benefits, you encourage irresponsibility.  The benefit system should be a safety net, not a way of life.
1319927737080053760 2020-10-24 17:04:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry If you have kids, you should be able to pay for them.  It's not rocket science.
1319922538370289664 2020-10-24 16:43:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jessphillips They don't.
1319922000643719168 2020-10-24 16:41:42 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @PrettyHatMech @julie4north @DawnButlerBrent @UKLabour It's hardly eugenics to say 'only have kids if you can afford them'! 😂
1319921764978331648 2020-10-24 16:40:46 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @julie4north @DawnButlerBrent @UKLabour Kids are expensive.  If you're going to have them, first make sure you can afford them, instead of relying on the taxpayer to pay for their upkeep.  Why is that unreasonable?
1319917552462594048 2020-10-24 16:24:02 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> Biology isn't my forte, but I'm pretty sure that men don't get periods. 🤔
1319916598501822464 2020-10-24 16:20:14 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JamessReality I take it you can't just upload them to the cloud, and then download them to your iPhone?
1319915772110667776 2020-10-24 16:16:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Potter2backup @DavidLammy @jayrayner1 Exactly. Racism isn't lurking in every corner, as the left would have us believe.
1319913717648285697 2020-10-24 16:08:47 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Hattie__K @9Scoot @BBradley_Mans He said people who can't afford kids should stop having them.  Sounds like reasonable advice, no?

1319773555106734080 2020-10-24 06:51:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @gnomoeoffice @kevinjwoods1 @allisonpearson Let it rip.  You can't stay locked down forever.   Sooner or later you have to relax measures.  People will die, sure, just like people die every year from the flu.
1319772947003953152 2020-10-24 06:49:25 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @allisonpearson Exactly.  There is zero point in lockdown unless it continues until we have a vaccine (if that ever happens).  What is happening is madness.
1319764425138704386 2020-10-24 06:15:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Fascinating. Thanks for sharing.

1319563498301640704 2020-10-23 16:57:08 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @sirebel @Femi_Sorry And this excites you? Being one small voice, with very, very little influence?
1319441715854454785 2020-10-23 08:53:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Independent How about, um, I dunno, maybe it's none of our fucking business!
1319432899515514881 2020-10-23 08:18:11 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MusicWade @covid_long @Femi_Sorry Would you apply the same logic to the n word, out of intrrest?
1319411884727160833 2020-10-23 06:54:41 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @covid_long @Femi_Sorry We all suffer bereavement, but grief doesn't make most people behave rudely.
1319410481631842305 2020-10-23 06:49:06 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry But she didn't.  And you know she didn't.  Stop being obtuse.
1319406824697843712 2020-10-23 06:34:35 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @sirebel @Femi_Sorry A veto, yes.   But not much of a say. One small voice out of many.
1319405474673053703 2020-10-23 06:29:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry So you're saying we once controlled EU rules?
1319389940468355072 2020-10-23 05:27:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry So is Lee Jasper an extremist then? 🤔 Because he thinks only whites can be racist.  Do you condemn @hackneyabbott's comments about white people?
1319387418815025153 2020-10-23 05:17:28 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SaltyDuchess @Femi_Sorry Yeah, I was shocked the first time a leftie called me a racist.  Now I just recognise it's just how they deal with anyone who dares to disagree with them.
1319385931556814852 2020-10-23 05:11:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Do you think you might be a tiny bit racist, Femi? 🤔
1319385773175701508 2020-10-23 05:10:55 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @mikemcg65624002 @Mr_W_Carpenter Take it from someone with an MSc in software development. It isn't as easy to get a coding job as many people assume...
1319383383760396295 2020-10-23 05:01:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @FrankLuntz The Betfair odds imply that Trump's true chances of winning are slightly worse than 1 in 3. Do you agree?
1319379248357007361 2020-10-23 04:45:00 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @stillgray Deep fake?
1319374859630149633 2020-10-23 04:27:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Grasall @Femi_Sorry @DominicRaab I must admit I haven't yet researched what's going on in Nigeria, but it wouldn't surprised me if it's not quite as one sided as Femi makes out.
1319369773839507468 2020-10-23 04:07:21 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @emilyhewertson Sounds like a scam, but your best bet is to ring NatWest or pop into a branch, and check if it's from them.   Don't click on any links, whatever you do! :)
1319360238580019200 2020-10-23 03:29:28 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @GaryMcleft @Femi_Sorry @DominicRaab I think he just tweets about stuff that his sponsors are interested in.

1319357018436677632 2020-10-23 03:16:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @DominicRaab How do you know this video is genuine?  And why should the UK government take sides in something that's none of their business?
1319356332663885826 2020-10-23 03:13:56 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @harrypujols @guardian What? Fake news?
1319264841182420995 2020-10-22 21:10:23 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @LeeHurstComic Don't knock it till you've tried it!
1319208474245464067 2020-10-22 17:26:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry So Femi, if you are so concerned, how come you haven't been tweeting about this issue?
1319093339518652418 2020-10-22 09:48:54 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @verybigcow @Femi_Sorry  https://t.co/OFwLyUb22F  He makes some good points.

1319088206441271296 2020-10-22 09:28:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry You're wrong

1319085115218272258 2020-10-22 09:16:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @onepablo @NowLeaver @Femi_Sorry So are blacks, proportionally.  Here's a friend for you:  https://t.co/LPIt2XBnoz  With that chip on your shoulder, it's the only friend you'll have. 😂
1319072467013468171 2020-10-22 08:25:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Andy72726059 @calvinrobinson Extremely good question.  He won't tell us, for some reason.
1319072266936852485 2020-10-22 08:25:10 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @calvinrobinson Where do ypu buy those t-shirts, btw?  Or do your sponsors supply them?
1319071816112025602 2020-10-22 08:23:22 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @calvinrobinson That's rich coming from you! 😂🤣😀😁
1319071059035959298 2020-10-22 08:20:22 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @onepablo @NowLeaver @Femi_Sorry As a man, I'm more likely than my girlfriend to be randomly stopped.  By your logic, that makes her more priviliged than me. 🤔
1319070113644072960 2020-10-22 08:16:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Mate, you keep telling us that your religion is based on fact, but we'lll need more than some study of hiring practices to be convinced.
1319062501900812289 2020-10-22 07:46:22 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JayneCallagha10 @Fox_Claire @calvinrobinson @Femi_Sorry I see the kinder, gentler brigade have given their scholarly assessment! 😂
1319018971295866883 2020-10-22 04:53:23 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Fox_Claire @calvinrobinson Exactly. @Femi_Sorry wants relativity to continue to be treated as a theory, but 'white privilege' to be taught as an incontrovertible fact. 🤔
1318981366340608000 2020-10-22 02:23:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @chrisbizarre2 @DawnButlerBrent Sadly, I don't think the full unedited footage will ever be forthcoming....
1318974879421648896 2020-10-22 01:58:11 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @flowesaunders68 @KemiBadenoch It's not a fact, ffs! It's a dodgy theory!
1318974517939679232 2020-10-22 01:56:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @tcmacmillan @flowesaunders68 @Femi_Sorry @KemiBadenoch Maybe - just a wild, stab in the dark guess - she had seen the video previously?  How crazy would that be?
1318974199235596295 2020-10-22 01:55:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @TAGBBlackbelt @flowesaunders68 @KemiBadenoch Such breathtaking maturity from one of the great political minds of our time.
1318973627090558976 2020-10-22 01:53:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @calvinrobinson @KemiBadenoch I call bs. What's your source for the 80 percent claim?

1318702744253902850 2020-10-21 07:56:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Independent Good for him. I hope it inspires the left to delete fake news.  Hi @carolecadwalla
1318622047862444033 2020-10-21 02:36:09 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Sozzinski @GuidoFawkes Is this true @CatSmithMP?
1318560753755054083 2020-10-20 22:32:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @piersmorgan I'm pretty sure that @ProfKarolSikora didn't say that, though?
1318559030198009862 2020-10-20 22:25:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @theJeremyVine @GaryLineker You're very trusting.  If he had walked out of the shop without paying, would you say he must have forgotten to pay?
1318558048546377742 2020-10-20 22:21:51 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @RiverMa64787788 @Femi_Sorry @scottroughton He thinks he actually has power and influence outside of Twitter! 😂

1318529242037166080 2020-10-20 20:27:23 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @SBIT_UK Did you record that in a cave? There's a lot of echo going on...
1318470377736163328 2020-10-20 16:33:28 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @KayBurley I love how Ms Burley is totally ignoring you! 🤣
1318449537145540608 2020-10-20 15:10:39 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @feeldalove168 @DawnButlerBrent @estherk_k It's a really important issue.  Ms Brent accused the police of racially profiling her. The full footage would hopefully determine whether they did, or if she owes them an unreserved apology.
1318445484990672897 2020-10-20 14:54:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DawnButlerBrent All of whom are waiting with baited breath to see the police bodycam footage!  Maybe you should team up with @estherk_k to get it released when she approaches the Information Commissioner.
1318310458227556357 2020-10-20 05:58:00 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @keepit1002018 Well done!  I keep hoping to get blocked by @Femi_Sorry, but it's almost like he doesn't want to give me the satisfaction!
1318303128702386182 2020-10-20 05:28:53 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @CorbynistaEdith What a fantastic use of my taxes!
1318262015476011008 2020-10-20 02:45:31 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @chris__sto @Femi_Sorry @Scotty2906 @ukhomeoffice The guy acts like he's Mr Logical, and then comes out with stuff like blaming the Home Office for government Covid policy!
1318254536155451394 2020-10-20 02:15:48 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @Scotty2906 @ukhomeoffice Mate, the government's Covid strategy has been all over the place, but how are the Home Office to blame!?!  You've just accussed civil servants of mass murder! 😂
1318253552448475136 2020-10-20 02:11:53 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @Scotty2906 @ukhomeoffice OK, and what on earth does that have to do with the Home Office? 😂  They just carry out the government's instructions!
1318253257605734400 2020-10-20 02:10:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @ukhomeoffice And you hold the Home Office responsible for that? 🤔
1318252313144889344 2020-10-20 02:06:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @piersmorgan @GMB Bzzzzt! You banned them, remember?
1318252086149218304 2020-10-20 02:06:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @KayBurley I'm sure that Ms Burley really appreciates the advice. #Mansplaining
1318223218092789761 2020-10-20 00:11:21 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @NikkiStix55 Best thing is probably just to block them and banish them from your mind forever. Life's too short.
1318178401681813508 2020-10-19 21:13:16 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry What does your sponsor think?
1318176204667654144 2020-10-19 21:04:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @NikkiStix55 The police officers concerned have said they want the footage released.  So has @DawnButlerBrent.  Therefore, I don't see why it can't be released.
1318170952589561856 2020-10-19 20:43:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @tony_como @Femi_Sorry @AsdaServiceTeam Or maybe he'll appear on I'm A Celebrity, alongside someone who had a number 5 hit in 1990 and an ex Lib Dem leader.
1318152657970843648 2020-10-19 19:30:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @officialbarnesy Surely it's overly familiar to touch officials, period, outside of a handshake (just as you wouldn't pat your boss at work on the back unless you had a really chummy relationship with them).
1318143801391710210 2020-10-19 18:55:46 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Femi - You have never had a real job.   I have worked for a number of years in sales.  Trust me - if you are not prepared to walk away from a deal, you'll get screwed over, every time.  (Reposting as you deleted the original post that I replied to)
1318143472092778496 2020-10-19 18:54:28 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @VinceReid @Femi_Sorry Femi has deleted his tweet! Wow!   I think that's the closest we'll ever get to him admitting he was wrong about something!
1318130254628741121 2020-10-19 18:01:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Femi - You have never had a real job.   I have worked for a number of years in sales.  Trust me - if you are not prepared to walk away from a deal, you'll get screwed over, every time.
1318123700630204418 2020-10-19 17:35:54 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @NikkiStix55 I'm not sure that will go down well with all sections of the community in Leeds...
1318119895192621056 2020-10-19 17:20:47 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @deerfold @JustVeryFrank @Femi_Sorry @joncraig Analysis usually incorporates an element of opinion.   You shouldn't have to write 'This is the writer's personal opinion' at the top of editorials, as it kind of insults the reader's intelligence.
1318119516912734208 2020-10-19 17:19:16 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @reb_femme Fair enough. :)
1318117209521164296 2020-10-19 17:10:06 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JustVeryFrank @Femi_Sorry @joncraig Why? He is entitled to express his opinion, just as someone is entitled to pay Femi to represent their views.
1318116855756820481 2020-10-19 17:08:42 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @joncraig Who funds you?
1318116446648623105 2020-10-19 17:07:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DawnButlerBrent @ssearena @wembleystadium How's the request for the police bodycam footage coming along?
1318115985027665920 2020-10-19 17:05:14 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DawnButlerBrent The guy was alleged to have not acted on a rape allegation -  https://t.co/SkzGfA9b06  Does that not remotely concern you?
1318115469245751296 2020-10-19 17:03:11 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @reb_femme People on the left demanding that Sentamu be given a peerage need to consider his opposition to gay marriage and the fact that he allegedly covered up a rape -  https://t.co/SkzGfA9b06  Or maybe they have, but race trumps gay rights in their hierarchy of victimhood.
1318111309955817472 2020-10-19 16:46:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @RobertJTAC @HonestCitizen62 @19_Micky_48 Who do you think is funding him?
1318111034645860354 2020-10-19 16:45:34 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @NikkiStix55 @RobertJTAC I wonder if @Femi_Sorry left Asda as soon as he realised it was packed, or thought, 'Sod it! I'm here now, so I might as well do my shopping, even if I am endangering publuc health'.
1318110159395323904 2020-10-19 16:42:05 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DonLeShoes @AlexIden2 @DawnButlerBrent Has it? That's disgraceful. It sends a message that the PC brigade can get their own way by kicking up a fuss.  Does it not concern you that Sentamu is against gay marriage?
1318109746478653441 2020-10-19 16:40:27 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @bea_johanssen @DavidDavisMP And someone with Dark Ages views on gay marriage.  https://t.co/maiX7XYjn9

1318109212774436865 2020-10-19 16:38:20 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DawnButlerBrent So you'd be happy for someone with homophobic views to be made a lord? 🤔  https://t.co/maiX7XYjn9
1318095262871638017 2020-10-19 15:42:54 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @PrimalPolitical I hope so, because after his tree hugging climate change speech, I'd given up on him.
1318089477529677824 2020-10-19 15:19:55 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @alan_bolam 🤣😂😁😂🤣  That escalated quickly! 😂  Are you a parody account? 🤣😂
1317971659073245184 2020-10-19 07:31:44 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Mr_Hugh_Jasse @Femi_Sorry @AsdaServiceTeam Femi's source of income is one of the great mysteries of our age...
1317970825824395266 2020-10-19 07:28:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ParveenAtwal3 Yeah, trying to debate with @Femi_Sorry is pretty pointless.  It's like playing chess with a pigeon - he knocks over the pieces, sh1ts on the board, and then acts like he's won!
1317953382435463168 2020-10-19 06:19:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @alan_bolam Let's say he is untouchable (he probably is). It doesn't mean that he abused his power.   Again, where is your evidence that he's guilty?
1317916145136054278 2020-10-19 03:51:09 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry I dunno. You've tweeted far dafter things.
1317915289384833026 2020-10-19 03:47:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @alan_bolam Sure, but people are frequently certain about things that are incorrect.  I'm afraid I'm a bit old school - I take the view that people are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.
1317883104204390405 2020-10-19 01:39:51 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MattBecker82 @callumpthomas @theJeremyVine Yes, but that doesn't really address the question.   Had the government appointed Archbishop Sentanu to the H of L, the left would have been up in arms about someone with homophobic views being given that position.  They can't win.
1317882764033654785 2020-10-19 01:38:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @hayfestival You missed out the word 'allegedly'.

1317878161380679681 2020-10-19 01:20:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Tweeet_Book @Femi_Sorry Quite.  https://t.co/maiX7XYjn9

1317842153322795009 2020-10-18 22:57:08 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> Restrictions that destroy entire industries aren't minor!
1317824921746264064 2020-10-18 21:48:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> The left are going nuts because John Sentamu wasn't made a life peer.  Given his views on gay marriage, they'd be even angrier if he had been.  You can't win!    https://t.co/maiX7XYjn9

1317816218120822785 2020-10-18 21:14:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @AgathaWhisker @AsdaServiceTeam Did you leave Asda immediately on discovering it was packed, to avoid risking public health? 🤔
1317814790841040897 2020-10-18 21:08:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @philprestwich @ZuluAlpha_1 @callumpthomas @theJeremyVine Yes, and just because this guy was black, doesn't mean that his race was a consideration!
1317793539183476737 2020-10-18 19:43:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @LozzaFox Are your lawyers good at getting blood out of stones?
1317786076480741376 2020-10-18 19:14:18 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @callumpthomas @theJeremyVine I think you'd love there to be, as that would give you a stick to beat the Tories with, but if you think that Johnson thought 'we can't be giving a peerage to his type', you're deluded. There would have been a valid reason that's nothing to do with race.
1317778840853368834 2020-10-18 18:45:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @callumpthomas @theJeremyVine But why should he be?  Would it not be patronising and racist to recognise him because he's black, not because of his achievements?   The question should be: 'would he have been given the honour had he been white?'  If the answer is 'no', the correct decision was made.
1317778473713369089 2020-10-18 18:44:05 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @theJeremyVine I'm pretty sure it wasn't because he's black, if that's what you're implying.
1317767656485904386 2020-10-18 18:01:06 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @EruditeUnionist What did you say?  I'm surprised she actually reads tweets from us plebs. :)

1317516881415327746 2020-10-18 01:24:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JohnSmi50968113 @ClareCraigPath @DrDomPimenta Again, I am a non-expert, but I would have thought government scientists would take all relevant stats into account (though maybe I'm being naive).  Btw, the name calling is unhelpful and unwarranted.
1317516186045812738 2020-10-18 01:21:51 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DawnButlerBrent @Twitter @MetroUK Do you think you were being abusive when you applauded someone calling one of your critics a white supremicist? 🤔
1317497616985395200 2020-10-18 00:08:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @NikkiStix55 He probably is, to be fair.

1317399894768930816 2020-10-17 17:39:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ClareCraigPath @DrDomPimenta I am a complete layperson, so forgive me, but do the government not take that into account when assessing the stats (for example, by looking at the results of the first test carried out on each person in a given period)?

I also used to work in a retentions role. I therefore got the dregs - the really angry customers.   Maybe part of the reason customers rarely got abusive was because I didn't use the sort of sarcasm you used in that tweet.

1316534699272146945 2020-10-15 08:21:46 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @kaos_steampunk @the_right_girl4 Be careful what you wish for! 😂
1316522670612189188 2020-10-15 07:33:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @tomhfh He probably thinks the same thing when he reads one of your inane tweets! 😂
1316504417047371776 2020-10-15 06:21:27 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @homo_troglodyte We have to agree to disagree on that.   I think corporal punishment should be brought back as a last resort, for serious and repeat offenders. I think that, with some kids, it's the only way to get through to them.
1316502473675333632 2020-10-15 06:13:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @homo_troglodyte Why make this personal? We on the right are better than that. Why not just calmly discuss the issues?  Sometimes kids are out of control. If Little Jonny keeps beating up the smaller kids, corporal punishment may fix it.
1316501207951777792 2020-10-15 06:08:42 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @homo_troglodyte It's not child abuse, ffs! 😂  I bet A and E depts in the 70s weren't full of teachers who had been beaten up!

1316500406739099650 2020-10-15 06:05:31 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @o_glyndwr1404  https://t.co/YrvlYzoJyC  I bet this cheered you up, Femi.
1316500053654208512 2020-10-15 06:04:06 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JuliaHB1 Shame you've blocked @Femi_Sorry as he'd be rejoicing.
1316499688116359172 2020-10-15 06:02:39 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Miss_Snuffy Bringing back corporal punishment might not be a bad idea.
1316491739016949765 2020-10-15 05:31:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @karencollinsnyc @SohrabAhmari @DavidCornDC Do you also think hotels havebthe right to turn away gays, by that logic?

1316449159537360900 2020-10-15 02:41:52 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @zuluhedgehog @Femi_Sorry @histsocwarwick Indeed, but who is his paymaster? He won't tell us, for some reason.

1316441837100560390 2020-10-15 02:12:46 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @histsocwarwick What are your qualifications to talk on this matter?
1316428591249448961 2020-10-15 01:20:08 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry NHS resources are being diverted to Covid, which costs lives. That is undeniable.
1316399150922072066 2020-10-14 23:23:09 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @FinchTwatticus @darrengrimes_ What was the context?
1316337176624476162 2020-10-14 19:16:53 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JuliaHB1 @alanmayeruk I live in Scotland.  I want an end to this constant threat of a referendum, as its puts businesses off investing in Scotland.  The people had their vote. Let's move on.
1316335814129917953 2020-10-14 19:11:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JuliaHB1 @LozzaFox @y_alibhai @JeremyVineOn5 Yes. Substitute the word 'black' for 'white', and folk like your pal @owenjones84 would be lining up to cancel her.
1316335369990930438 2020-10-14 19:09:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JuliaHB1 It's interesting that @theJeremyVine has described @y_alibhai as a friend.  Given how she feels about whites, I wonder if the feeling it mutual.
1316332499006615553 2020-10-14 18:58:18 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ProfKarolSikora Agreed. @Femi_Sorry take note.
1316332248136908800 2020-10-14 18:57:18 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Which is 100 percent true
1316325334808133633 2020-10-14 18:29:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @AlStewartOBE @Twitter A shame more people in your former profession don't embrace that attitude of intellectual humility.
1316296318831276032 2020-10-14 16:34:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @beaumont_andrew @GMB Exactly. The hypocrisy is stunning. @piersmorgan

1316083870769524738 2020-10-14 02:30:21 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Tony_Robinson What happens at the end of the three weeks?
1316075265580302336 2020-10-14 01:56:09 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry I agree.   What's your solution then, Femi?
1316073848283058178 2020-10-14 01:50:31 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ditsy_chick @RSwanson_UK @piersmorgan @BorisJohnson Plus, the principle is sound: don't blow your economy on a strategy that will only save lives if a vaccine is found.
1316073528526077954 2020-10-14 01:49:15 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ditsy_chick @RSwanson_UK @piersmorgan @BorisJohnson If we are comparing the countries as a whole, yes. But if we are comparing the population densities in towns and cities, it might not be so clear cut.
1316072987200815104 2020-10-14 01:47:06 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @lucyallan Exactly. Do we do a stop-start lockdown approach until a vaccine arrives? It's madness.
1316065637228216320 2020-10-14 01:17:53 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JuliaHB1 Where's the option for 'none of the above'?
1316064109885116423 2020-10-14 01:11:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @RSwanson_UK @ditsy_chick @piersmorgan @BorisJohnson Hi  As it happens, I'm about to start a temp job for the Job Centre (via an agency). Something to consider? That's the one part of the economy that will be requiring staff for the foreseeable!
1316063061636251648 2020-10-14 01:07:39 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry End of the ethnic pay gap: Young employees from minority groups now earn MORE than white British workers -  https://t.co/IlkB6w4zzG  You must be delighted that Britain isn't as racist as you thought, Femi.
1316062142798409728 2020-10-14 01:04:00 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @AlStewartOBE @Keir_Starmer @BorisJohnson I'm pleased that @Keir_Starmer is actually articulating a specific position, rather than accusing the government of incompetence without saying exactly what he'd do differently.
1316057944866394119 2020-10-14 00:47:19 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ditsy_chick @RSwanson_UK @piersmorgan @BorisJohnson I quite like the Swedish model.
1316057870811770880 2020-10-14 00:47:02 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Nope, glad I voted Tory, as we would be well and truly up the creek now with Corbyn running the show.
1315996906779271168 2020-10-13 20:44:47 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @piersmorgan Have they not heard of a website called Amazon?
1315776246542983170 2020-10-13 06:07:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Anna_Soubry I wasn't aware that the Mirror was ever on Boris's side...
1315775993374806021 2020-10-13 06:06:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @chanet_zac @CorbynistaEdith She's a parody. :)
1315734836909309958 2020-10-13 03:23:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JuliaHB1 She must have never heard of Skype.

1315730392192868352 2020-10-13 03:05:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @PineappleStraws Who is our bigoted leader, oh racist one?

1315699669020930048 2020-10-13 01:03:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TSocialist19 @Femi_Sorry @KramerGraham Very succinctly put. :)   Does he ever reply to you?
1315699239905898497 2020-10-13 01:01:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SJK415 @Femi_Sorry @KramerGraham Good luck getting an answer. Femi doesn't do evidence.
1315673321405636608 2020-10-12 23:18:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper Were those officers encouraged or instructed by senior officers to take the knee?
1315668417702236161 2020-10-12 22:59:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @piersmorgan Are you being deliberately ironic?
1315662915551277056 2020-10-12 22:37:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Cherry_Cola79 @TallyCat8 @Femi_Sorry I would say the same to you. If you don't like my tweets, feel free to block me. I won't lose any sleep over it, I promise! :)
1315634896321339392 2020-10-12 20:46:17 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TallyCat8 @Femi_Sorry Yes it is if it's erm whinging.   'It's cold and wet outside.'  That's a factual statement, but it's also a whinge that makes me unhappy and anyone who has to listen to it unhappy.   That's all Femi does - whinge.
1315630133798227969 2020-10-12 20:27:21 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Whinge, whinge, whinge.  Say something constructive for a change, man!
1315617330576191488 2020-10-12 19:36:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @kindersun @GMB @piersmorgan @kehindeandrews I'm white and was offended. Funny old world...
1315560215501209602 2020-10-12 15:49:31 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper And far left content too, presumably?
1315559934407389185 2020-10-12 15:48:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @WeVotedToLeave @CockMat @Peston @ClarkeMicah Let's say it's junk - that your Guardian articles refute it.  Does that mean that the professor is wrong about everything else?
1315559286219649025 2020-10-12 15:45:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @WeVotedToLeave @CockMat @Peston @ClarkeMicah So the Professor of Medicine at Stamford has a screw loose, because Tom from Twitter says so? OK, you've sold me.  What about @ProfKarolSikora? Do dismiss him too?
1315556772116148224 2020-10-12 15:35:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @WeVotedToLeave @CockMat @Peston @ClarkeMicah Confirmation bias.  Don't confuse finding views that agree with yours with thinking.
1315556530088017920 2020-10-12 15:34:53 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @WeVotedToLeave @CockMat @Peston @ClarkeMicah Let's get this right.  Because a declaration was hijacked by idiots and/or activitists, you are sceptical of any respected authority who also signs it? 🤔
1315554063992397826 2020-10-12 15:25:05 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @WeVotedToLeave @CockMat @Peston @ClarkeMicah Like the Stamford Professor of Medicine who you rubbished because he'd signed Barrington? 🤔
1315553789252952066 2020-10-12 15:23:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @WeVotedToLeave @CockMat @Peston @ClarkeMicah Right, so you pick and choose your experts depending on whether you agree with them! 😂
1315538740002070530 2020-10-12 14:24:11 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @WeVotedToLeave @CockMat @Peston @ClarkeMicah That's a very creative way for an admirer of experts to disniss an expert.  Following your logic, why should I dismiss the Barrington document because Tom from Twitter dismisses it, when a professor of medicine supports it?
1315438818305114112 2020-10-12 07:47:08 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @WeVotedToLeave @CockMat @Peston @ClarkeMicah Let's get this right.  You're sceptical of a Professor of Medicine at Stamford University, just because he signed the Barrington Declaration?  You claim to cherish expert opinion. Maybe what you really cherish are views that accord with your own.
1315432661180207105 2020-10-12 07:22:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @WeVotedToLeave @CockMat @Peston @ClarkeMicah Great to hear! Does this guy qualify?  https://t.co/mdNBg3xTyh
1315344930605277186 2020-10-12 01:34:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @obasaolorunfemi How long you got?
1315342425846697984 2020-10-12 01:24:06 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> Great @talkRADIO interview with an anti lockdown Professor of Medicine:  https://t.co/mdNBg3xTyh
1315341870290042881 2020-10-12 01:21:54 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Fox_Claire I wonder how long it is before @NicolaSturgeon plays her usual game of one-upmanship. :(
1315341425572229122 2020-10-12 01:20:08 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Fox_Claire Very interesting discussion with a Professor of Medicine who thinks this sort of approach is crazy:  https://t.co/mdNBg3xTyh
1315330355063386113 2020-10-12 00:36:08 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @djbshearer @afneil @UofGlasgow You can do that remotely, but who knows what the future holds?  And in my limited experience, few students put their hands up to ask questions. I must have asked literally 90% of my class's questions!
1315327863722254339 2020-10-12 00:26:14 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @djbshearer @afneil @UofGlasgow The way things are going with distance learning, I'm not sure how much of a future the campus has, period. When lecturers are held remotely, the need for a huge campus is limited.
1315326648477155328 2020-10-12 00:21:25 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DanielFooksArt @afneil Apart from his employers, which is a matter of public record?  I'm more interested in who pays @Femi_Sorry to do nothing but tweet all day and night.
1315324439119233024 2020-10-12 00:12:38 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @afneil @UofGlasgow Would you describe the Adam Smith building as beautiful?
1315323601399287810 2020-10-12 00:09:18 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @afneil To be fair, parts of it are less attractive than others (Boyd Orr being the standout example).
1315323335182606336 2020-10-12 00:08:15 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SarahBrownUK @RECLAIMproject This kerfuffle has given them exposure that they otherwise could only have dreamed of.  @LozzaFox has done them a huge favour.
1315284099775504385 2020-10-11 21:32:20 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BrexitBanter52 What do you think, @themetskipper?

1315259191909548032 2020-10-11 19:53:22 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @NoughtFollowers @DPJHodges @ColinJMcQuade @NateSilver538 That article says that, historically, the margin of error has been two percent.  Based on that, Trump is toast.
1315064910527827969 2020-10-11 07:01:22 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SamuelJJack Try mindfulness and meditation. Your doctor may be able to refer you to a course. It can work miracles.

1315031305957109760 2020-10-11 04:47:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HouseOfCats66 Wow! That was quick!
1315028557358346242 2020-10-11 04:36:54 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> They'd probably get a knock on the door from the same officers who are going after @darrengrimes_
1315027250140581888 2020-10-11 04:31:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry If only. It's never just a thought with you. It's literally 100 a day, minimum.

1314707966273216514 2020-10-10 07:22:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @paul_tyndale @YouGov No, it's a sad sign of the times.

1314677989406322695 2020-10-10 05:23:52 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @smiggastitties @DanMcCa44510994 @SexyFutureJoel @MissDomergue @Im_acvnt That is probably an innocent person's address.
1314677524677488641 2020-10-10 05:22:02 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @smiggastitties @DanMcCa44510994 @SexyFutureJoel @MissDomergue @Im_acvnt I suggest you delete that tweet. You could be wrong, and that tweet could have grave implications if someone acts on it.
1314671496871239680 2020-10-10 04:58:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @UkInvaded @PrimalPolitical I'd leave it to braver souls than me to find out!
1314669915404726304 2020-10-10 04:51:47 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ClampittGeoff His meagre £70k salary!  You must be a parody account. Hey @CorbynistaEdith! Is that you? 😂
1314648023113269248 2020-10-10 03:24:48 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TheRealInsano @Femi_Sorry @darrengrimes_ He doesn't seem to block.   Maybe his sponsors pay him by the number of replies he gets!
1314643713793110016 2020-10-10 03:07:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Self-own???  How old are you? 😂
1314639932720373762 2020-10-10 02:52:39 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MellingWorld @timothy_stanley @DPJHodges Holocaust denial isn't illegal in the UK, as far as I'm aware.
1314638934014595075 2020-10-10 02:48:41 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Situla9 @DPJHodges Let's say your interpretation is correct (it probably isn't).  What benefit is there to banning racist views (however you define that catch-all term)?
1314638273034227714 2020-10-10 02:46:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ClampittGeoff @DPJHodges I think he was supportive of his right to free speech. Fair play.
1314552012705538048 2020-10-09 21:03:17 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @y_alibhai You need to chill out. I mean that genuinely. Try meditation.
1314551521758019584 2020-10-09 21:01:20 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @norfolkmum1 @Loulou3169 @NimkoAli @NikkiStix55 There is no need for the sarcastic tone. It was a valid point.   By talking about 'men', 'women', 'blacks', 'whites', etc, like they were cultural dopes who all acted the same and faced the same problems, you miss out on a great deal of subtlety.
1314549146142093312 2020-10-09 20:51:54 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @norfolkmum1 @Loulou3169 @NimkoAli @NikkiStix55 You are talking about 'men' and 'women' as if these terms actually mean anything. Some men. Some women. You are making the classic Marxist mistake of thinking in terms of groups rather than in terms of individuals. The world is more complicated than that.
1314547726005219329 2020-10-09 20:46:15 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @norfolkmum1 @Loulou3169 @NimkoAli @NikkiStix55 Which men specifically?   And do you think we can do so without being ridiculed by feminists?  Also, should the government not be doing that, given that its job is to represent all the people, not to choose which groups to champion?
1314540747698376705 2020-10-09 20:18:31 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @norfolkmum1 @Loulou3169 @NimkoAli @NikkiStix55 I once looked into how many domestic abuse shelters there were in England that welcomed men. There was just one.   I suspect that domestic abuse against men is underprioritized relative to how common it is, to avoid upsetting the toxic masculinity narrative.
1314505428844371968 2020-10-09 17:58:11 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @norfolkmum1 @NimkoAli @NikkiStix55 It is, but that is no justification for the government turning its backs on male victims, who make up a large proportion of victims.   I see no case for discrimination.
1314500632003346432 2020-10-09 17:39:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @norfolkmum1 @NimkoAli @NikkiStix55 I just hope that the government have also appointed someone to tackle domestic violence against the forgotten victims: men and boys.
1314500434611052545 2020-10-09 17:38:20 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @NimkoAli Who is your counterpart for Men and Boys?

1313500207653543936 2020-10-06 23:23:47 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> Is that why you chose to become a professional tweeter rather than use your law degree?
1313443153488289792 2020-10-06 19:37:05 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DPJHodges Hard to say. What's your best guess?

1313083732082012166 2020-10-05 19:48:52 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @LesleyPollard1 @Femi_Sorry Then why was face mask wearing not mandatory till the outbreak had been ongoing for 4 months?

1313052489093185537 2020-10-05 17:44:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @FeartheBeardy @Femi_Sorry Quite.   Femi is a lawyer by training, so he should be thinking critically, and asking what evidence there is that his cherished mask actually works.
1313051613859328005 2020-10-05 17:41:14 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Do you write as a scientist or as a propagandist?

1311982116549406720 2020-10-02 18:51:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @piersmorgan Quite. I'm no fan of cancel culture, but wishing someone's death is horrible, and I hope that the virtue signalling lefties who are cheering this news suddenly find that the phone stops ringing.
1311978969642815491 2020-10-02 18:38:56 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @CorbynistaEdith Let's say a black left wing politician got Covid. Those celebrating Trump having Covid would be calling for anyone who cheered the black politician's diagnosis to be arrested.  Total hypocrisy.

1311465534777511936 2020-10-01 08:38:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @roister_doister @hurt_chinese @Independent You sound like a religious person getting upset about people taking the Lord's name in vain.   If the message gets diluted, so be it. Relax. Life's too short. :)
1311464846349815809 2020-10-01 08:35:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SarawakRajah @roister_doister @Independent  https://t.co/rimvW9cAay  Pure comedy genius! 😂
1311462177283477505 2020-10-01 08:25:23 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @roister_doister @hurt_chinese @Independent But what if they are right and you're wrong? Genuine question.   And even if climate change is real, are young Greta's solutions the best answer?  It's not as clear cut as you think.
1311458228576935936 2020-10-01 08:09:42 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @roister_doister @hurt_chinese @Independent You support her message. That's great. However, others strongly disagree with it and have the right to criticise. That's democracy.

1311455588572975104 2020-10-01 07:59:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @roister_doister @hurt_chinese @Independent It sounds like you have a saviour complex, much like Greta.  Being the white knight in shining armour feels good, doesn't it?
1311454904951730179 2020-10-01 07:56:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Robertinno53 @FrankBarone43 @Woodyjunior67 Quite. Circle of life and all that. Not sure messing with nature is a good thing.
1311452656653733891 2020-10-01 07:47:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @roister_doister @Independent The difference between the West and China is that we have a healthy tradition of taking the mickey out of political figures.   No-one gets a free pass, nor should they.  Long may it continue.
1311452141018664960 2020-10-01 07:45:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @roister_doister @hurt_chinese @Independent Translation: he's got me there, so I'll say something immature to save face.
1311451906989064193 2020-10-01 07:44:34 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @roister_doister @Independent You think parodying an autistic person is wrong. I say we shouldn't discriminate like that. We'll have to agree to disagree.
1311451478708621313 2020-10-01 07:42:52 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TSocialist19 @Femi_Sorry @RosieisaHolt Quite. He is a bit camp, but I honestly couldn't care less what his sexuality is (even though he probably assumes that, being right wingers, we are homophobes! 😂).
1311451047576195073 2020-10-01 07:41:09 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @roister_doister @Independent Parody of political figures is a healthy part of democracy.
1311450824355336194 2020-10-01 07:40:16 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @roister_doister @Independent Maybe someone who thinks their messiah complex is good material for parody! 😂
1311450163215507456 2020-10-01 07:37:39 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @roister_doister @Independent Yes, if you would take the piss out of them otherwise.
1311449899666472960 2020-10-01 07:36:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TSocialist19 @Femi_Sorry @RosieisaHolt Hmmm...  It's almost like he's bothered if people think he's gay.  Maybe he didn't want to worry his hordes of female admirers!
1311448570994794497 2020-10-01 07:31:19 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Gordon_Pasha @DPJHodges I think it's ingenious.
1311447978599739392 2020-10-01 07:28:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @roister_doister @Independent So we should give her special treatment because she is autistic?

1311062991639642114 2020-09-30 05:59:10 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Independent Not controversial if you're woke.

1311021915193122817 2020-09-30 03:15:56 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DiannaDelicious So sorry for your loss.  You must be going through hell right now, but it will get better with time, I promise.

1310883044266475521 2020-09-29 18:04:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @reb_femme I agree. They mean well, but they can be challenging to communicate with (but you're not allowed to say that these days!).
1310882800443240448 2020-09-29 18:03:09 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @GeorgeAylett 'Let me put it in language you'll appreciate.'  Are you trying to be patronising, or do you just lack self-awareness?
1310736289851998209 2020-09-29 08:20:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @SchofieldStuart @realDonaldTrump And who are your current sponsors?  Google is as much in the dark as the rest of us.
1310729022628823040 2020-09-29 07:52:05 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @AlStewartOBE And will they get to overrule @NicolaSturgeon? 🤔
1310715623207559175 2020-09-29 06:58:51 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @PelPositive @BorisJohnson To be fair, what was the better alternative?
1310685477708627969 2020-09-29 04:59:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @reb_femme Good luck.  I'd be cheeky and push for £50 compensation for the hassle, and don't let them close the complaint otherwise. It will cost them more than £50 if the ombudsman looks at the case, so they will probably agree if you stick to your guns.
1310684674998579200 2020-09-29 04:55:52 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @OhaLdn @bigeck2281 @tynewrc @DawnButlerBrent How lazy and intellectually dishonest can you get?   There is zero evidence of racism, yet you infer it to avoid dealing with a valid point.
1310601916699770892 2020-09-28 23:27:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @reb_femme My advice is to ring first thing in the morning - say, 8pm, or post 11pm.  Alternatively, you could email a complaint to lutz.schueler@virginmedia.co.uk - their CEO - including your account number and phone number, and let them come to you. :)
1310568373001113604 2020-09-28 21:13:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @reb_femme I used to work for Virgin.   My advice is to ask them to raise a complaint, give you the complaints reference number, and refuse to let you close it till you are happy with the outcome.
1310548781776220163 2020-09-28 19:55:53 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jonnycottle @tynewrc @DawnButlerBrent Right, so calling a random stranger an idiot because they make a valid point is a sign of politeness? 😂🤣

1310532527308890112 2020-09-28 18:51:17 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry How do you know he's far right?
1310528155703275524 2020-09-28 18:33:55 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @woahjil @Kendo38383612 @DawnButlerBrent @metpoliceuk @MetCC It is bullying (no to mention wasting police time).  It's a variation of the schoolyard 'I'm going to tell the teacher on you'.   Genuine abuse is one thing. Calling someone a crap MP is merely stating an opinion.
1310526848128946177 2020-09-28 18:28:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @woahjil @Kendo38383612 @DawnButlerBrent @metpoliceuk @MetCC Calling someone a crap MP isn't illegal. Thankfully, we are still allowed to criticise our elected representatives.

1310519828994818048 2020-09-28 18:00:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Jhiaxus_Prime @DawnButlerBrent But a quick look at her timeline shows it doesn't happen all the time. In fact, it's extremely rare.
1310519641085808640 2020-09-28 18:00:05 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @terryelaineh1 @DawnButlerBrent @Twitter @TwitterSupport This isn't a feminist issue, for crying out loud!   Whether the victim is a man or a woman is irrelevant!
1310519219575025664 2020-09-28 17:58:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @tynewrc @DawnButlerBrent Sure, but she also 'calls out' people who aren't racist, like the police officers she falsely accused of racially profiling her.
1310519068647198720 2020-09-28 17:57:48 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DawnButlerBrent Do you not think it's abusive to encourage people to call your critics white supremacists?

1310262265560653829 2020-09-28 00:57:22 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Miss_Snuffy I'd be interested in @DavidLammy's take on this, in light of his Comic Relief comments.
1310219294580580352 2020-09-27 22:06:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry 'The unprofessionalism doesn't bother me.'  'Besides, the tweet from me he's referring to had a similar tone.'  So you admit to being unprofessional?
1310197473261105152 2020-09-27 20:39:54 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry I take it that your sponsors disapprove of @afneil?   It would be very interesting to know who these mysterious people are.
1310009128060940292 2020-09-27 08:11:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Tarring all Brexit supporters with the same brush, eh Femster? 🤔

1309980449964470272 2020-09-27 06:17:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TSocialist19 @Femi_Sorry Today Femi has used a rape analogy and made a joke about a child abuser.  I don't know whether he's being deliberately shocking to get retweets or is just lacking self-awareness.
1309965115844956161 2020-09-27 05:16:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @afneil He's come far since he wrote celeb gossip for The Express, to be fair.

1309945142007209986 2020-09-27 03:57:14 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry You could have used a much less emotive analogy.   How do you think a rape victim would feel about what you wrote?
1309903502806847490 2020-09-27 01:11:46 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper That would be fine if they treated BLM the same, but they don't.  They defied the lockdown with total impunity.

1309787005472182274 2020-09-26 17:28:51 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @GentlemanGeorge I see he's been suspended. Sucha pity.

1309551194168340481 2020-09-26 01:51:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @afneil Will you be inviting @owenjones84 as a guest?

1309487639146508289 2020-09-25 21:39:16 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @AlStewartOBE @Conservatives Until recently, I would have had the PM down as belonging to that wing.
1309286119255740419 2020-09-25 08:18:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Jackagilo @Independent Nope. It's democracy (just as in the UK, it's democracy for the Tories to be in power without winning an overall majority). There are good reasons for the electoral college system.

1308339111569379329 2020-09-22 17:35:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @CorbynistaEdith I think they should revive Gordon Brown's slogan of 'British jobs for British workers'.  That's a message that your average person can actually relate to.

1307777395940831232 2020-09-21 04:23:23 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @nickreeves9876 Only he didn't really abuse them and he isn't really alt right. But apart from that, spot on.

1307760021816606724 2020-09-21 03:14:20 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @chrissywhite71 @ddale8 It is a lie, in the sense of stating something he knows to be false. :)
1307729146383159298 2020-09-21 01:11:39 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidMerfyn @afneil I'm an Englishman living in Scotland. Trust me, the Scots can be pretty welcoming too. :)   Perhaps not the cybernats you encounter on Twitter, but Scots generally are very welcoming.

1307264723407319040 2020-09-19 18:26:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @RuddsBunny So you were poking fun at your own inability to reason?   I didn't know you were so self deprecating.
1307264247685054467 2020-09-19 18:24:19 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Tweeet_Book @Femi_Sorry Seriously, I would not want Femi representing me as a lawyer. He has zero grasp of logic.

It's not looking like there will be a vaccine anytime soon, so you either wreck the economy and watch the virus run free once you lift restrictions, or you take the Swedish approach and protect the elderly and vulnerable, and let everyone else live their lives.
1306874145028878336 2020-09-18 16:34:11 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @arthistorynews @ProfKarolSikora Why the need for sarcasm? It was a reasonable, politely expressed point. Muted. Bye.

1305430042378481668 2020-09-14 16:55:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Kings_of_London @EssexPR Interesting. So if I go to the pub with 10 colleagues, am I covered if it's a work meeting? 🤔
1305317109854081030 2020-09-14 09:27:05 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DJBURNS_was @heidiEC5 I do. Do you, @Femi_Sorry? 🤔

Whether it's 12 noon, 12 midnight or 5am, you can be pretty sure that Femi has just tweeted! He must be the bionic man, as he never seems to sleep!

1305266214499999745 2020-09-14 06:04:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Lisa_Defries @Femi_Sorry I dunno.   I'm not going to think about how things would be under Corbyn this late at night, or it will give me nightmares!
1305258540320411649 2020-09-14 05:34:21 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Again, what's your better alternative?  I voted for the least undesirable option.  But I think you knew that. Sometimes I think you like being deliberately obtuse.
1305251214775529479 2020-09-14 05:05:14 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @VirginActiveUK Will it matter in 100 years' time? If not, why worry about it? Why worry us about it?   You need to try practising some positive thinking!
1305101823183925249 2020-09-13 19:11:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SinclairBsfree @Independent @ITV @BGT @Diversity_Tweet That attitude is why Trump got elected.
1305101626131329024 2020-09-13 19:10:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JosephCornforth @Independent False equivalence.
1305095450576531458 2020-09-13 18:46:17 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MartinDaubney @SadiqKhan Hey @DawnButlerBrent. You might want to delete your tweet about this incident in light of this revelation.
1305095229545091073 2020-09-13 18:45:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MartinDaubney @SadiqKhan Hey @DavidLammy. What are your thoughts on this? 🤔
1305094796873289729 2020-09-13 18:43:41 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HaZaa365 @JackCuthbert @Femi_Sorry But he is funded. This is well established. Even he has admitted it.  Now, whether Soros is his benefactor, I don't know for sure, but your aggressive comment was unwarranted.
1305064045008113664 2020-09-13 16:41:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @spectator @afneil Will you be inviting @owenjones84.as a guest?
1305063468551286784 2020-09-13 16:39:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HaZaa365 @JackCuthbert @Femi_Sorry Who do you think funds Femi? 🤔
1305057123743793154 2020-09-13 16:13:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @HaZaa365 @JackCuthbert @Femi_Sorry Wow! The hostiluty! I bet you're a real firebrand in real life too! 😂
1304936787786293248 2020-09-13 08:15:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @reb_femme @Femi_Sorry Someone is paying him to tweet bollocks 24/7. It's as likely Sadiq as anyone.
1304924163279409152 2020-09-13 07:25:39 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @CorbynistaEdith Did you succeed?
1304894959863181318 2020-09-13 05:29:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Raging_Vampire @PenaltyOf @Femi_Sorry I've never heard of software development referred to quite like that, but I can kind of see the similarities!
1304891897379422208 2020-09-13 05:17:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Raging_Vampire @PenaltyOf @Femi_Sorry OK, you've beaten us with your superior analysis. I'll go back to writing my MSc dissertation, as I'm not able to compete with a towering intellect such as yours.
1304891573033996289 2020-09-13 05:16:09 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> Scotland 'not far away' from eliminating coronavirus, says @NicolaSturgeon on 26th June.     https://t.co/n3esyP9Lki  And people accuse @realDonaldTrump of recklessly talking down the risks of Covid!
1304873063373328385 2020-09-13 04:02:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Yes, but could you do a better job?
1304853116794408961 2020-09-13 02:43:20 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Raging_Vampire @PenaltyOf @Femi_Sorry 'Weakened our democracy? Tick! Fostered the rise of the far right? Tick!'  Up to that point, I thought you were talking about Corbyn, who would have given 16 year olds the vote, cancelled Brexit and fostered anti-semitism.
1304791332926488577 2020-09-12 22:37:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry And who was the better alternative who I should have voted for?
1304761565342822403 2020-09-12 20:39:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Mate, take a break. You seem to spend your entire life enmeshed in petty bollocks like this. No wonder you're too stressed to sleep.
1304760981533478912 2020-09-12 20:37:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @georgebernhard @AaronBastani @mrmickf And delete his tweet rather than doubling down.
1304760759327625217 2020-09-12 20:36:20 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @AaronBastani @mrmickf I think you're not ready for GCSE history yet, if you think Hitler negotiated Versailles! 😂
1304757907003772935 2020-09-12 20:25:00 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JackCuthbert @Femi_Sorry He relies on people replying to him to keep Mr Soros and his other sponsors happy.
1304756165277102081 2020-09-12 20:18:05 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Hundreds. 😂
1304750280265928704 2020-09-12 19:54:42 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @BorisJohnson Damn right!
1304750117405286400 2020-09-12 19:54:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @BreezerGalway Yeah, because criminals routinely announce their plans to the world before executing them.
1304747770348273664 2020-09-12 19:44:44 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @mikeonthemarne @Keir_Starmer Did you ever get your Labour Party membership restored? 🤔
1304733813755576320 2020-09-12 18:49:16 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @toadmeister And Jesus wept
1304730132976984068 2020-09-12 18:34:39 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BigAlexBoom @BlueStaffyOwner @DawnButlerBrent It doesn't matter.  You could be walking your dog and get abused.  Objectively, that's no better or no worse than a postman being abused while delivering letters.
1304727792240689152 2020-09-12 18:25:20 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Eh? Where is the similarity?  You realise he's not planning to get the SAS involved, right?
1304727179733995520 2020-09-12 18:22:54 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ceedeepeehnm @BlueStaffyOwner @DawnButlerBrent That said, I don't think it matters whether someone is doing their job. Abuse is abuse, whether you're on holiday or doing your job.
1304727025580732416 2020-09-12 18:22:18 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BigAlexBoom @BlueStaffyOwner @DawnButlerBrent No-one deserves abuse full stop, irrespective of whether they are doing their job or just minding their own business while not doing their job.
1304726324154699781 2020-09-12 18:19:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ceedeepeehnm @BlueStaffyOwner @DawnButlerBrent Abuse is unacceptable.   It wasn't my intention to imply otherwise.  To be honest, I think I just read 'We don't agree with you Dawn', and thought, 'yep, I disagree with Ms Brent about just about everything, so that describes me', without looking further.
1304722975791480833 2020-09-12 18:06:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @themetskipper It would be nice if #BLM acknowledged that the huge majority of police are decent people who risk their lives to keep us safe.
1304717177174528001 2020-09-12 17:43:10 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @frank_bough @ThrussellJames @salliemonkey @DawnButlerBrent Nor have you Frank.
1304716735568805893 2020-09-12 17:41:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ceedeepeehnm @BlueStaffyOwner @DawnButlerBrent Many of us feel the same. We is appropriate.
1304715525914865665 2020-09-12 17:36:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DawnButlerBrent So do I, but I also think it's despictable to applaud someone being called a white supremacist for expressing an opinion.  You owe that person an apology.
1304715114772410368 2020-09-12 17:34:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @andreinawie No way! You don't look nearly old enough to be a grandparent!
1304598626044465152 2020-09-12 09:52:05 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry What does that word soup even mean? Brexit began as a division in Johnson's mind?!?
1304597163150848002 2020-09-12 09:46:16 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @DPJHodges Can you give an example of when you've ever happily admitted you were wrong? 🤔
1304595599296258050 2020-09-12 09:40:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TSocialist19 He's obsessed. He needs to take a break, for the sake of his mental health.
1304593838607040515 2020-09-12 09:33:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @Leon_SFrench Do you ever sleep man? 😂
1304589248750813191 2020-09-12 09:14:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TSocialist19 @Femi_Sorry @AlexHol39917226 @Essexgooner2 Quite. Makes you wonder what he's hiding.
1304586439708073984 2020-09-12 09:03:39 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Jamilah212 @71slacknuts @ukblm Tell that to the family of a stabbing victim. The fact is that stop and search takes weapons off the streets, and that can only be a good thing.
1304585978909261824 2020-09-12 09:01:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> Hey @metpoliceuk. Given that you fined @Piers_Corbyn for holding a rally in defiance of lockdown rules, I'm guessing that the organisers of this event can also expect a heavy fine?   CC: @MetCC
1304584777551486976 2020-09-12 08:57:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> This is the most painful cancellation I have had yet. From someone I spent 10 happy years working with, many lovely family dinners and lots and lots of laughs. Someone I thought was a friend.  https://t.co/f00nCbntAu
1304570850100817920 2020-09-12 08:01:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TSocialist19 @Femi_Sorry I imagine that Femi's eyes were welling up as he was posting that. Thinking you are some kind of savour must feel good and be addictive, even if it is based on a delusion.
1304549545624449031 2020-09-12 06:37:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DPJHodges We are becoming more like North Korea by the day.
1304515334070833152 2020-09-12 04:21:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @AchimW @MailOnline Good question. Why don't you? North Korea is well known for this sort of thing.
1304511395170529281 2020-09-12 04:05:27 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DPJHodges @Femi_Sorry You have to wonder what else Femi will be proven wrong about.
1304502802790649856 2020-09-12 03:31:19 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @PoshDOSHy @MailOnline It's nothing to do with culture, and ww are entitled to care about the oppression of innocent civilians.
1304500976502669313 2020-09-12 03:24:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Yes I do
1304452838261764096 2020-09-12 00:12:46 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Azth0nL @JuliaHB1 I hope you weren't expecting loads of likes for that! 😂
1304452485445292034 2020-09-12 00:11:22 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @MakeVotesMatter And UKIP would have had loads of MPs in 2015 if the system were representative, but it ain't.
1304214340321636353 2020-09-11 08:25:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Tweeet_Book @Femi_Sorry So it's unemployed ex law student Femi vs the learned judges. Tough one. 🤔
1304205377777676288 2020-09-11 07:49:27 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Then why bother?
1304190544676093952 2020-09-11 06:50:31 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry You mean blame? 😂
1304126423515488256 2020-09-11 02:35:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @campbellclaret @Channel4News Almost as pretentious as saying the hand of history is on your shoulder.
1304104167087255553 2020-09-11 01:07:17 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @NikkiStix55 What next? Banning lads' nights out and hen parties? This is madness.
1304008220407738369 2020-09-10 18:46:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MikeStuchbery_ @Bastion28654275 What did the security entail? A guard outside your front door? Have you thought of suing @DVATW? If not, why not?
1303997682030182400 2020-09-10 18:04:09 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @allisonpearson Will learning the freemason secret handshake help my chances of becoming one?
1303994178293108739 2020-09-10 17:50:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Independent A great program, but do you think it possibly could have been a bit more diverse?
1303993605112180736 2020-09-10 17:47:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @PrimalPolitical @DPJHodges Maybe that's why he asked on Twitter.
1303848945844727815 2020-09-10 08:13:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Mate, take some time off and chillax. You're exhausting us and you must be exhausting yourself.
1303842185528344577 2020-09-10 07:46:15 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @paulhutcheon @Alliance4Unity Anyone else think he looks a bit like Harold Bishop off Neighbours?
1303841653359247367 2020-09-10 07:44:09 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @MarianneSansum @NikkiStix55 I take it the Covid virus likes to stay away from weddings and funerals? Don't blame it!
1303841142644117505 2020-09-10 07:42:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @NikkiStix55 If a nearby church happen to be holding a wedding or funeral that day, could they all meet up there without technically breaking the rules?   That said, it would be a crass thing to gatecrash a wedding or funeral for that reason! 😂
1303840384523669505 2020-09-10 07:39:06 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @NikkiStix55 If there are not seven people in a confined space at once, is it a gathering of seven? If someone stands a few feet away or in the next room, are they part of the gathering?
1303839449240002560 2020-09-10 07:35:23 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Independent Complete waste of time in my experience, unless you like getting d*** pics (if you're a woman) or ignored (if you're a man).
1303837565053698048 2020-09-10 07:27:54 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @IainDale Is it @piersmorgan?
1303824524006371334 2020-09-10 06:36:05 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Independent 😂
1303788675046821890 2020-09-10 04:13:38 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @NikkiStix55 I imagine ot depends on whether it's a work knees up, or if it's a work-related gathering, like a team building exercise.
1303737999440728065 2020-09-10 00:52:16 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @piersmorgan @CMO_England Do you trust @ProfKarolSikora, or just the medical professors you agree with?
1303724283450056704 2020-09-09 23:57:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DPJHodges I'm a fan of out of the box thinking, but this is batshit crazy! 😂
1303723956042706944 2020-09-09 23:56:27 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Mike_Fabricant It's nuts. I hope you're considering resigning the whip in protest at this madness.
1303720939339870209 2020-09-09 23:44:28 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @AlexTheGuiri @Femi_Sorry Quite. The joke's on Femi! 😂
1303717561406816256 2020-09-09 23:31:03 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @spencermorgan93 @piersmorgan Hey Piers. Seen this?  https://t.co/4j0MfXTMNl  I hope you are proud of yourself.
1303716842758901766 2020-09-09 23:28:11 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DPJHodges He's been spending too much time around @realDonaldTrump! 😂
1303447332311240710 2020-09-09 05:37:15 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @emilyhewertson Thete is no consistency. This is seat of the pants stuff.
1303445796965285890 2020-09-09 05:31:09 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DawnButlerBrent @Jo_Coburn @CommonsSTC @guardian  https://t.co/vJ76idFHgf  🤔
1303425774528192512 2020-09-09 04:11:35 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DawnButlerBrent Why so defensive? People are entitled to challenge their elected representatives. In fact, it's essential that they do. It doesn't make them trolls.
1303407271041433600 2020-09-09 02:58:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLammy 😂😅Only you could turn this into a race issue!
1303375669603295234 2020-09-09 00:52:29 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @richardpauptit @Londonred8 @Femi_Sorry No, we are asking reasonable qurstions.   If a foreign power is paying Femi to influence British politics, we have a right to know.
1303373606697816070 2020-09-09 00:44:18 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ijeoma1000 @Londonred8 @Femi_Sorry So he funds you too, Gregory?
1303373472316436486 2020-09-09 00:43:45 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @richardpauptit @Londonred8 @Femi_Sorry We have. He never replies. 🤔
1303367881309253633 2020-09-09 00:21:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @piersmorgan So does @ProfKarolSikora, but he's not nearly so pessimistic as you (yet far better qualified to comment).

1303363363129483269 2020-09-09 00:03:35 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @markmcan @afneil I dunno. I think going to war with Iraq was more chilling.

1303363016008830976 2020-09-09 00:02:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @afneil .@BorisJohnson must have been spending too much time with @realDonaldTrump and picked up his bad habits!

1303338961155260416 2020-09-08 22:26:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Cathy14178236 Oh dear. :(
1303328526972710913 2020-09-08 21:45:10 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Cathy14178236 Something to ask your doctor about:  https://t.co/0bnMpJCVuT.

1303298620700217344 2020-09-08 19:46:19 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @SkyNews So you'll stop talking about it? 🤩
1303295630132076544 2020-09-08 19:34:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @caroldecker @brightywriting @EssexPR @Lord_Sugar No way! I wasn't expecting an eighties pop icon to appear in a random Twitter politics discussion! 🤩
1303269141533646848 2020-09-08 17:49:11 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Independent It looks like racial politics has trumped #MeToo
1303124530349645824 2020-09-08 08:14:33 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent People should be free from all crime. However, that's unrealistic. All you can do is have robust enforcement in place, which already happens.
1303117095538917377 2020-09-08 07:45:00 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent There are racist police officers. That will never change.  There are also violent police officers. That will never change.   There will always be bad people, however good your enforcement is. That's life.
1303112928112107520 2020-09-08 07:28:27 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BertZZ_ @Femi_Sorry This is just a guess, but I imagine that doctors in (say) Nigeria get paid a lot less than the NHS pays.
1303112699514155011 2020-09-08 07:27:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent They may not be deliberately inciting or orchestrating violence, but it's pretty clear that their protests have had some pretty nasty consequences (albeit unintended). Also, it would be nice if they condemned the violence and told people to stick to non-violent protest.
1303111422130479110 2020-09-08 07:22:28 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent Some polls have Trump ahead, some behind.   BLM are causing violence. Just look at how many people have died due to non-natural causes since the unrest following George Floyd's death (I won't use the word murder - that's for a jury to decide).
1303107944939163650 2020-09-08 07:08:39 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent Sure, it can cut both ways, but I think the vast majority of Americans aren't huge fans of violence on the streets, and will support the law and order candidate.
1303107702076387331 2020-09-08 07:07:41 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Northernmanv2 @Femi_Sorry @verified @DVATW Nah, he's just throwing the word 'racist' around as it's easier than thinking.

1303105420291190784 2020-09-08 06:58:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent 'There is certainly evidence that Trump’s law-and-order message might well prove successful. In the swing state of Wisconsin, for instance, there has been a fall in support for BLM, which is only likely to continue after days of rioting there. This could really hurt Biden'
1303104067376472069 2020-09-08 06:53:14 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent  https://t.co/j6du6C9bjt
1303102482307059712 2020-09-08 06:46:56 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent History also tells us that it can backfire.   I think we both know that there's a good chance that BLM will get Trump re-elected. The irony.
1303101488475107331 2020-09-08 06:42:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DVATW @OwenJones84 So that's what's set @Femi_Sorry off! 😂  https://t.co/MuEuBoXmE6
1303100829411483649 2020-09-08 06:40:22 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent Yeah - in terms of slagging off BLM. The contrast with Martin Luther King, who was a peaceful, decent, non-violent man and balaclava donning figures who set buildings alight in the name of equality could not be starker.
1303100358521225217 2020-09-08 06:38:30 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent What does that mean? Are the police supposed to ignore minor infractions of the law?
1303098830162980870 2020-09-08 06:32:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent Based on what?  BTW, do you know how many blacks have died in British police custody over the past decade? 13. Let that sink in.
1303098628790157316 2020-09-08 06:31:38 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent How do you know this?
1303098565049356288 2020-09-08 06:31:22 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent But they are. Because of people think 'vandalising statues' when they hear 'BLM', it kind of undermines the credibility of the messenger.
1303096952960278528 2020-09-08 06:24:58 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent But why does BLM not grasp the nettle and talk about how it will address the fact that blacks are far more likely to end up in prison? That is something that, as a society, we need to have a serious conversation about, to find solutions, instead of tearing down statues.
1303096629222924289 2020-09-08 06:23:41 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent So everybody who takes pride in their national heritage is a foaming at the mouth racist?
1303096489787490312 2020-09-08 06:23:08 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent 'If George Floyd were white, and Cauvin black, one wouldn't be dead, and the other not in jail.'  You can't possibly know that.
1303087396322410500 2020-09-08 05:47:00 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent Also, I know it's been said many times, but if BLM are really worried about black people, why don't they address black on black murders, instead of focusing exclusively on police racism/brutality (which, let's be honest, is pretty rare)?
1303086997104463874 2020-09-08 05:45:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent I didn't say that BLM makes people racist (though, sadly, it might). I said it isn't good for race relations, and it's hard to argue that defacing Winston Churchill's statue in the name of anti-racism is good for race relations.
1303086696083456001 2020-09-08 05:44:13 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent Are a in b in the video though? What evidence is there that the George Floyd police officers were remotely racist? One of the officers used excessive force, but that doesn't make him a racist.
1303081792359075841 2020-09-08 05:24:44 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLinney4 @DawnButlerBrent You are assuming that:   a. The police really were brutal. b. The police really were racist.  c. The protests were effective.  On point c, I would say that the protests may have set back race relations and the civil rights movement by decades.
1303064232922157056 2020-09-08 04:14:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry @BorisJohnson @itvnews Yeah, that's exactly what is means. Brilliant deduction, Sherlock.

1303040186654351360 2020-09-08 02:39:24 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry But why does that matter? If there is a shortage of EU doctors, GPs from other parts of the world can fill the gap.

1302996754690969600 2020-09-07 23:46:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @SJJB55 @DavidLammy Possibly because it's fake news.

1302724894430498817 2020-09-07 05:46:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JuliaHB1 The BBC missed out 'where they can' in their headline. 🤔

1302661609433829381 2020-09-07 01:35:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JulieAmillard @rickus_dickus @WMPolice Exactly. You'd have thought that the police would want to lock the bastard up before he has a chance to offend again, and the best way to do that is to enlist the public's help in identifying and locating him.

1302564650928791552 2020-09-06 19:09:47 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @thomasod_ @DavidLammy  https://t.co/suYxrODIwx  Says victims were chosen at random.

1302563105948553217 2020-09-06 19:03:39 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jessphillips Have the police released a description of the suspect?
1302562419252879361 2020-09-06 19:00:55 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Nibbler39465073 @DavidLammy Normally, I strong disagree with Lammy, but I think he's right. No-one should languish in prison for 8 months when they haven't been convicted of a crime.
1302561175423643648 2020-09-06 18:55:59 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @thomasod_ @DavidLammy The BBC are saying the police are looking for a single suspect?

1302559899927425024 2020-09-06 18:50:55 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLammy Isn't it odd that no description of the suspect has been released?
1302559466995548160 2020-09-06 18:49:11 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLammy Any word yet on who the suspect is?
1302559191035457536 2020-09-06 18:48:06 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLammy It's utterly disgraceful. No-one should spend that long in prison if unconvicted.
1302556769676337153 2020-09-06 18:38:28 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @jeremycorbyn So we can turn.Bolivia into Venezuela?
1302541694425067520 2020-09-06 17:38:34 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Yeah, but what about the 99 percent of other non-EU countries which that doesn't apply to?

1301817079226683393 2020-09-04 17:39:12 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @NikkiStix55 @TrevorGreetham @IsabelOakeshott Yeah, but you quickly adapt. Plus, you can still have video meetings with the boss.
1301816704524333066 2020-09-04 17:37:43 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @NikkiStix55 @TrevorGreetham @IsabelOakeshott In my experiences, workplaces are places where you are couped up largely with the sort of people you wouldn't interact with otherwise. You make the best of it, but I'd be happier working alone, and socialising with mates in my own time.
1301815667923001344 2020-09-04 17:33:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @NikkiStix55 @TrevorGreetham @IsabelOakeshott I used to work in a call centre, and rang through to otherbsitrs for help all the time. It's perfectly viable.
1301815252762456064 2020-09-04 17:31:57 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @NikkiStix55 @TrevorGreetham @IsabelOakeshott I think it can be. Or you put the customer on hold and quickly give the boss a ring. It will be weird at first, but will soon become the new normal.   Plus, introverts may be more comfortable with that approach.
1301814345408622592 2020-09-04 17:28:21 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TrevorGreetham @NikkiStix55 @IsabelOakeshott They can, but if that it's is boss's attitude, they deserve to have unhappy clients who take their business elsewhere.
1301814012640997377 2020-09-04 17:27:01 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @NikkiStix55 @TrevorGreetham @IsabelOakeshott As for the social aspect of work, yeah, you miss out on the banter, but you also get to avoid some unpleasant people who , unlike with Twitter, you can't simply block. :)
1301813530857963520 2020-09-04 17:25:06 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @NikkiStix55 @TrevorGreetham @IsabelOakeshott Surely you can just IM the boss. As with face to face communication, if they are free they'll respond immediately.
1301812594513195009 2020-09-04 17:21:23 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> Does that include @GaryLineker? 🤔
1301805232842825728 2020-09-04 16:52:08 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @LeeHurstComic I travelled on the subway in Glasgow during rush hour the other day. I counted six people on the platfirm. That is unsustainable.
1301612393609547776 2020-09-04 04:05:52 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @garybrisk @Femi_Sorry Exactly. Femi needs to think before tweeting.
1301612207340486657 2020-09-04 04:05:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry I am, actually. What was the better alternative? Corbyn for PM? 😂
1301609515075489793 2020-09-04 03:54:25 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ChesseCorfe @CharlotteCGill @RumbaRebel13 Yeah, I think he has a heart of gold, and she's played him to perfection.
1301609323487952901 2020-09-04 03:53:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @TymeMiss @YouGov I wonder how many people in the US have even heard of them.
1301601425336799240 2020-09-04 03:22:17 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @NotABotpls @patriotic_ally @GoodwinMJ And what if he does? You delete yours?
1301600747944116224 2020-09-04 03:19:35 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @BrexitBazzer I'm guessing that doesn't do it for you, Barry? 😂
1301593333664546817 2020-09-04 02:50:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Miss_Snuffy This is ridiculous. It's a bit like getting upset by the word 'niggardly' (meaning stingy - a word with that has nothing to do with race) or the word 'niggle' meaning 'a trivial annoyance'.
1301524805984890881 2020-09-03 22:17:49 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @afneil How do you deal with people going into incognito mode to avoid paying? Isn't the business model built on a lot of trust?
1301524380862877703 2020-09-03 22:16:08 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Independent Inspired! 🤩

1301520132448096257 2020-09-03 21:59:15 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @FuturesBen_TDAN @rjparkerjr09 Interesting. So would you advise against joining a market that has been trending strongly for some time?
1301519083050016769 2020-09-03 21:55:05 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DavidLammy @GaryLineker How many will you be taking in, David?

1301517664494460935 2020-09-03 21:49:26 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Of he sues you, are yoir sponsors also liable? 🤔
1301304120146563073 2020-09-03 07:40:53 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @adn01jpc @Femi_Sorry You cared enough to comment.
1301303910754324483 2020-09-03 07:40:04 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Mate, you need to chillax. I hope you have a few drinks during Last Night, relax, and join in with the sing song!
1301303565537947650 2020-09-03 07:38:41 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Femi_Sorry Brilliant, isn't it? 😎

1301191816146898945 2020-09-03 00:14:38 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @henrywesto Quick bullet to the back of the head would have been an even better sentence.
1301191016549150726 2020-09-03 00:11:27 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @tackyBalrog @prageru I'm sure they appreciate your expert advice.

1301168322466250752 2020-09-02 22:41:17 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DouglasKMurray How come they get to protest but @Piers_Corbyn gets a £10k fine? 🤔
1301166387805683712 2020-09-02 22:33:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Strandjunker @realDonaldTrump There was the small matter of the thousands of civilians that his bombs killed, however.
1301160332753281026 2020-09-02 22:09:32 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @betblu3 @DawnButlerBrent @Twitter You weren't talking about racial hatred specifically, were you?   The point still stands. I don't see how some hate can be condemned, but not other hate. All hatred is irrational and destructive.
1301158940869382144 2020-09-02 22:04:00 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @ryles_mark @DawnButlerBrent @Twitter Agree 100 percent.  But Ms Butler never debates. She is a propagandist.
1301158404631785472 2020-09-02 22:01:52 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Df40460539 @DawnButlerBrent @Twitter Quite. Aa an MP, she should be willing to engage with everyone.
1301158170598035457 2020-09-02 22:00:56 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @sidddorable @DawnButlerBrent @Twitter Examples?

1301157598109077511 2020-09-02 21:58:40 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DebbieShrubb @Mediawatcher201 @DawnButlerBrent @Twitter True, but I haven't seen any abuse on her timeline.
1301157387064221698 2020-09-02 21:57:50 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @betblu3 @DawnButlerBrent @Twitter Hatred is everywhere. I'm sure there are things that even you hate. :)
1301157208625946625 2020-09-02 21:57:07 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @JodyFoxTweets @DawnButlerBrent @Twitter The latter is debatable! 😂
1301157078103404546 2020-09-02 21:56:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DawnButlerBrent @Kipperwacker @Twitter Why not simply block people you don't want to hear from? A lot of your Labour colleagues do.
1301112965157052416 2020-09-02 19:01:19 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @Independent Well trolled!
1301091341406007296 2020-09-02 17:35:23 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @NikkiStix55 .@JonathanPieNews can be pretty funny.
1301089134493265921 2020-09-02 17:26:37 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @DawnButlerBrent When will we see the bodycam footage?
1300859113644142597 2020-09-02 02:12:36 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @robinbull1 @GroundJokes @estherk_k .@DawnButlerBrent claims that she's told @metpoliceuk that she wants the footage released.  It could just be that one hand doesn't know what the other is doing because I can't believe that Ms Butler would lie to us.
1300856787298643972 2020-09-02 02:03:21 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @estherk_k Most odd, given that @DawnButlerBrent claims that she wants the footage released, and the officers also want the footage released. What gives, @metpoliceuk? CC: @themetskipper
1300844126666133505 2020-09-02 01:13:02 +0800 <JohnWoodbridge6> @scook2003 @Femi_Sorry Source? I imagine that Rashford is wealthier.
