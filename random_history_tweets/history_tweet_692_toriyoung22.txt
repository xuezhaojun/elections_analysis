1333992924481085442 2020-12-02 12:34:32 +0800 <toriyoung22> Exactly! I hope this is the beginning of the end for Trump reign of terror, too. Trump learned this crap from Roy Cohn, who was Joseph McCarthy's Chief Counsel.
1333992064334192640 2020-12-02 12:31:07 +0800 <toriyoung22> Nope.

1333988942673178624 2020-12-02 12:18:42 +0800 <toriyoung22> I fully expected Trump to sell pardons, steal artwork from the White House on his way out.
1333985789839962112 2020-12-02 12:06:11 +0800 <toriyoung22> .@realDonaldTrump is LYING to his followers, PRETENDING to raise money to fight election results, but the "fine print" says up to 75% of those funds will go to "Saving America" PAC, which he can use for personal expenses, pay himself millions, etc.

I have NEVER threatened or abused anyone here or anywhere. All I did was tweet an article about Trump's attorney making threats to Chris Krebs. What gives?

1333590508799549440 2020-12-01 09:55:28 +0800 <toriyoung22> .@realDonaldTrump is IGNORING 50 million Americans who have no food. He's IGNORING 2000+ daily American COVID-19 deaths. He's IGNORING 9 million families getting evicted in the next 35 days. He's golfing and tweeting crazy lies about not being a LOSER.
1333583366340313088 2020-12-01 09:27:05 +0800 <toriyoung22> .@realDonaldTrump LIED about Obama's birth certificate to de-legitimize his presidency. Now, Trump is LYING about the election to de-legitimize Biden's presidency. @GOP is complicit in the Trump fraud.

1332547648188948480 2020-11-28 12:51:31 +0800 <toriyoung22> No politician in U.S. history is more corrupt than Trump. Biden is deeply religious. Trump isn‚Äôt even slightly religious. Biden is faithful to his wife. Trump is a serial adulterer. Biden is already trying to fight covid &amp; save lives. Trump is golfing.
1332545518459711488 2020-11-28 12:43:03 +0800 <toriyoung22> I just hope that Corey Lee and the selfish assholes like him, limit the death and disability caused by Covid to themselves. If they want to die for Con-man Trump, so be it. But they shouldn‚Äôt take innocent people (who are trying to be safe) with them.
1332544750973456384 2020-11-28 12:40:00 +0800 <toriyoung22> Unfortunately, you‚Äôre in Dallas, TX. Texas is a Trump state. But it will be a blue state within the next 10 years.
1332544086775975936 2020-11-28 12:37:22 +0800 <toriyoung22> .@realDonaldTrump a judge YOU APPOINTED &amp; two GW Bush appointees rejected your claims in Pennsylvania case as being WITHOUT MERIT.
1332538418769760257 2020-11-28 12:14:51 +0800 <toriyoung22> Happy 61, Donny! üéÇüéÅüéâüéä I had that birthday 10 years ago. Hope your birthday and the next 10 years (and beyond) are happy, healthy, and prosperous.
1332537889847091200 2020-11-28 12:12:44 +0800 <toriyoung22> Trump will never be able to get a "white shoe" attorney. He'll start with Jay Seculow. Then, after Trump doesn‚Äôt pay and lies to him, some kid fresh out of law school. Then after that attorney withdraws, a court appointed public defender.
1332537073580969985 2020-11-28 12:09:30 +0800 <toriyoung22> Of course it's a scam. Social Security says on their website that THEY WILL NEVER CALL YOU. Your Social Security number CANNOT BE CANCELED until you die.
1332536503877058560 2020-11-28 12:07:14 +0800 <toriyoung22> A. Like Bernie Madoff, alone, broke, in prison until he dies.

1332479482419060738 2020-11-28 08:20:39 +0800 <toriyoung22> "Yall" should understand that the Electoral College will officially elect Biden on December 14. It won‚Äôt get to SCOTUS or House.

1332478355606650880 2020-11-28 08:16:10 +0800 <toriyoung22> @JoyAnnReid @ForQ2 So, WHY did you just perpetuate it?
1332476993124716544 2020-11-28 08:10:46 +0800 <toriyoung22> Won't happen. 25th Amendment requires Pence and over half of Cabinet to declare Trump incapacitated. They won‚Äôt do it, but if they did, Trump could challenge them. To overrule Trump challenge, BOTH 2/3 of Senate and 2/3 of House have to vote siding with Pence &amp; Cabinet.
1332474094181253120 2020-11-28 07:59:14 +0800 <toriyoung22> Especially because Trump is sabotaging everything for Biden. Canceling $450 billion in pandemic relief. Pulling troops out of Afghanistan &amp; Iraq. Putting stooges in civil service position.
1332469667756011520 2020-11-28 07:41:39 +0800 <toriyoung22> That tiny desk was a metaphor for Trump. He‚Äôs small, petty, pathetic and sad.

1331938624917495812 2020-11-26 20:31:29 +0800 <toriyoung22> @usabusinesshawk @realDonaldTrump The most dangerous thing Trump is doing. Destroying faith in the election system and institutions, just to soothe his fragile ego.

1331933890437476352 2020-11-26 20:12:40 +0800 <toriyoung22> @usabusinesshawk @realDonaldTrump If Trump does pardon himself, a Federal entity such as SDNY can still bring charges and test whether a self-pardon is valid. It will go all the way to SCOTUS, of course.
1331930952893796352 2020-11-26 20:00:59 +0800 <toriyoung22> I read a few days ago that Scotland may seize Trump properties there soon after he leaves office. I REALLY hope so. Trump has gotten away with his criminal activities for decades. It‚Äôs time he pays the piper.
1331929168028737543 2020-11-26 19:53:54 +0800 <toriyoung22> .@realDonaldTrump is a crook by any measure. Never before have we had a President who is so guilty that he‚Äôs planning to pardon himself and the rest of his crime family. It won‚Äôt apply to his state crimes and to the future Federal crimes he and his family will likely commit.

Now, that‚Äôs a whopper. You never allege that crap in court. @realDonaldTrump is a weakling, always whining about unfair treatment, like a baby.

1331383777344405504 2020-11-25 07:46:43 +0800 <toriyoung22> .@tedcruz is fine with 1000 Americans dying every day because SELFISH right wingers refuse to follow CDC guidance related to indoor gatherings. He wants to politicize mask wearing and Thanksgiving. Hospitals are running out of ICU beds and staff. You may need one.
1331381221021024257 2020-11-25 07:36:33 +0800 <toriyoung22> I hate OANN, but I,m not for banning free speech. Twitter SHOULD take down OANN tweets that give false covid info, incite violence or otherwise endanger people.
1331380388044759040 2020-11-25 07:33:15 +0800 <toriyoung22> No, but I really care that Trump is working up right wing, armed groups into a frenzy, thinking Biden stole the election. Trump has such a fragile ego that he will destroy democracy before he‚Äôll admit defeat.
1331377147445792769 2020-11-25 07:20:22 +0800 <toriyoung22> I really hope @TIME is considering @WhipClyburn for their  Person of the Year. James Clyburn is why @JoeBiden won the Democratic nomination. Electing Biden to deal with our Covid and economic crises is a monumental change.
1331375292456202242 2020-11-25 07:13:00 +0800 <toriyoung22> I believe it was stupid of Hunter to accept a position on Burisma board. But I don‚Äôt believe all of the nonsense and lies about Joe Biden being involved in corruption related to it. You guys find the tiniest stupid move by Dems, but totally ignore Trump corruption and crimes.
1331365592696201217 2020-11-25 06:34:27 +0800 <toriyoung22> .@Mike_Pence - the only experience you gained in the past 4 years was lying and sucking up for Trump. Not exactly qualifying you for future office. Add your previous homophobic, transphobic, racist policies as governor and that makes you a failure.
1331364578211446785 2020-11-25 06:30:25 +0800 <toriyoung22> .@Mike_Pence - In 4 long years, Trump destroyed our economy by not dealing with coronavirus, millions of small businesses bankrupt, RAISED taxes on middle &amp; lower class, raised prices for Americans through tariffs, LOST 14 million jobs. Stock market rise is on Biden cabinet picks
1331362641739087872 2020-11-25 06:22:43 +0800 <toriyoung22> .@realDonaldTrump has had the LEAST transparent administration in US history. He won‚Äôt even allow the media to see the White House guest book. We have to find out contents of calls/meetings with Putin from Russian media because Trump keeps it secret.
1331362040527482880 2020-11-25 06:20:20 +0800 <toriyoung22> It's "really scary" that only 9.4% would have acted on FAKE propaganda and lies?
1331361786310758400 2020-11-25 06:19:20 +0800 <toriyoung22> .@realDonaldTrump was assisted by election interference from Russia in 2016. The Trump campaign, including servers in Trump Tower were exchanging unusually high amounts of information with Russian intelligence servers in 2016. Kushner tried to establish a secret back channel.
1331359029818322945 2020-11-25 06:08:22 +0800 <toriyoung22> .@realDonaldTrump is so deeply narcissistic that he is incapable of putting Americans first. His administration is staffed by incompetent people whose only "qualification" is fealty to Trump. Morale is really bad among competent career people.
1331265412797874180 2020-11-24 23:56:22 +0800 <toriyoung22> .@realDonaldTrump is still a grifter. His latest con is lying to the "marks" that are his supporters in order to separate them from their money. That's what he‚Äôs always done.
1331264272756662272 2020-11-24 23:51:50 +0800 <toriyoung22> .@realDonaldTrump won‚Äôt write a letter to Biden. Trump is an immature, sore loser. He is doing his best to sabotage and booby trap the government to hobble Biden‚Äôs presidency.
1331263740600225792 2020-11-24 23:49:44 +0800 <toriyoung22> A promise is a promise. Go away @realDonaldTrump. You could seek asylum in Russia or North Korea.

1331226409612705793 2020-11-24 21:21:23 +0800 <toriyoung22> .@realDonaldTrump has NEVER been about America first. He‚Äôs TRUMP FIRST and America alone! We no longer protect Europe and NATO. Trump withdrew fro nuclear arms control treaty. Part of his many gifts to Putin because he owes hundreds of millions to Putin's oligarchs.
1331225438333460481 2020-11-24 21:17:32 +0800 <toriyoung22> Is he still on the run?
1331193679579471872 2020-11-24 19:11:20 +0800 <toriyoung22> My meager unemployment check of $191/week will stop in December, so we are having a modest meal. Trying to save every penny we can at this point. It‚Äôs not safe for us to risk getting covid, as we could be particularly vulnerable.
1331184892030251010 2020-11-24 18:36:25 +0800 <toriyoung22> CORRECTION: Last day to register to vote for Georgia Senate runoff elections is DECEMBER 5! Also, they have been purging voter rolls, so DEMOCRATS, check to make sure you are still registered and if not, re-register by December 5.

1331182585066651649 2020-11-24 18:27:15 +0800 <toriyoung22> I'm pretty sure Trump tweeted that he told Emily Murphy to start the process soon AFTER her letter was made public. He had to IMMEDIATELY take credit for it. No one gets to upstage the geriatric toddler.
1331179737083912192 2020-11-24 18:15:56 +0800 <toriyoung22> Why are Republicans so devious and deceitful? And how is that they convince so many that it‚Äôs the Dems who are crooked?
1331178862714109952 2020-11-24 18:12:27 +0800 <toriyoung22> I wonder if this demand is what led to Emily Murphy deciding to issue a letter of ascertainment to Presiden-Elect Biden?
1331178384752185345 2020-11-24 18:10:33 +0800 <toriyoung22> When nearly a third of Americans are food insecure and half of Americans cannot come up with $500 in an emergency, our financial conditions are dismal. Only the investor class is in great shape.

1330334593849946112 2020-11-22 10:17:38 +0800 <toriyoung22> Today, while the G20 held a virtual meeting about combatting coronavirus worldwide, Trump played golf while the other 19 world leaders tried to reach solutions. 25,000+ Americans have died of Covid since the election. Trump doesn‚Äôt care about anyone but himself.
1330333907024113664 2020-11-22 10:14:54 +0800 <toriyoung22> Unfortunately, there are millions of Americans who believe the false image of Trump as a successful businessman because of the phony Apprentice show. It‚Äôs a cult of personality, albeit a disgusting personality. Cults don‚Äôt behave logically.
1330332920137932803 2020-11-22 10:10:59 +0800 <toriyoung22> I'm LMAO that you call Biden "Ol' sniffy" when Trump, who snorts Adderal is sniffing constantly in every public speech. I was a teenager in 1968. I have a Master‚Äôs in International Business. I'm betting that I have a lot more world experience than you do, by your immature insults
1330331868835717120 2020-11-22 10:06:48 +0800 <toriyoung22> Apparently, you think you are so smart that you can read peoples' minds. Do you tolerate people with opinions different than yours or do you just insult them like you are doing to me? Trump supporters ate lemmings running to the cliff to jump with him.

1329990370122289153 2020-11-21 11:29:48 +0800 <toriyoung22> Several sleep specialists say 300 mcg, which is slightly less than 1/3 of a milligram is the optimal dose. It‚Äôs available very cheap on Amazon. When I tried 5 mg or 10 mg, I woke with a headache every time.
1329988638097035264 2020-11-21 11:22:55 +0800 <toriyoung22> Yes. I use it to help me sleep. It‚Äôs VERY important to have the right dose. I tried 5 mg at first and kept waking up with a headache. Then I read some articles, including one by a sleep specialist that said the PROPER dose is only 300 mcg, a lot less than 5 mg. It works.
1329987851572822018 2020-11-21 11:19:48 +0800 <toriyoung22> FYI, the "good faith" side is Democrats. The "bad faith" side is Republicans.
1329987099580239872 2020-11-21 11:16:49 +0800 <toriyoung22> .@tamaracalif is incorrect. Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives, which is sort of an equivalent of an indictment. There was a trial in the Senate and Trump was NOT found guilty. If he had been found guilty, he would no longer be president. @melreynoldsU @RicColes1
1329983440985354240 2020-11-21 11:02:16 +0800 <toriyoung22> .@SenBobCorker I appreciate your tweet, but I cannot help but notice that Republicans are only "brave" about calling out Trump for his recklessness if they aren‚Äôt running for anything or in very safe places like Romney. Republicans need to show integrity, but they don‚Äôt.
1329981421616730113 2020-11-21 10:54:15 +0800 <toriyoung22> Pence can issue a preemptive pardon like Ford did for Nixon.

1329979002946154498 2020-11-21 10:44:38 +0800 <toriyoung22> .@JennaEllisEsq should tell that to Trump. Trump and Giuliani are perpetrating OUTRAGEOUS LIES to sway public opinion, but the rule of law says Biden won. Biden‚Äôs win is being certified as we speak.
1329978257047916544 2020-11-21 10:41:40 +0800 <toriyoung22> Folks, this is what "delusional" looks like.
1329978020740796416 2020-11-21 10:40:44 +0800 <toriyoung22> Trust in our institutions is gone because your boy @realDonaldTrump has been lying about them and appointing people to cabinet posts who are intent on DESTROYING those institutions. Steve Bannon announced Trump admin plan to "destroy the administrative state."
1329977177895440384 2020-11-21 10:37:23 +0800 <toriyoung22> Bullshit! Just because there are more Democrats who get more votes, doesn‚Äôt mean they cheat. They appeal to voters' needs. In 1972, it was REPUBLICANS who burglarized Democrat HQ in Watergate Bldg. Trump has dozens of associates who have been indicted and/or convicted.
1329975932602384384 2020-11-21 10:32:26 +0800 <toriyoung22> BULLSHIT from a nearly illiterate Trump supporter.
1329975719623946240 2020-11-21 10:31:35 +0800 <toriyoung22> .@not_that_actor thinks campaigning honestly, counting ALL legal votes, including from people of color, and releasing true numbers of votes (even in states like Georgia &amp; Pennsylvania, where Republicans control vote certification) is cheating.
1329974585450582016 2020-11-21 10:27:05 +0800 <toriyoung22> No one has been more vulgar in the press than Donald Trump, who lies, insults and obfuscates ‚Äî when he‚Äôs no tweeting and golfing and stuffing junk food in his pie hole.
1329973839032270849 2020-11-21 10:24:07 +0800 <toriyoung22> Sidney Powell should be disbarred for perpetrating a fraud. When asked for evidence of her outrageous lies about the election, she said that‚Äôs not how the legal system works. She‚Äôs clueless at best, dangerously devious at worst.

1329961991838920705 2020-11-21 09:37:03 +0800 <toriyoung22> .@RichardGrenell should stop chastising reporters for reporting information released by Don,Jr's spokesperson. It was publicly released by Trump. Reporters are free to reportmon publicly available information.
