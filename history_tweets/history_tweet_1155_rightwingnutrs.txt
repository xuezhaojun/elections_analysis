1344070245221347329 2020-12-30 07:58:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed @SaxonDixie It reminds me of Model UN.
1344070014236766208 2020-12-30 07:57:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeracleanVision Say what you want, but the valiant loser IS a western archetype. Typically is flourishes into a later winner. Typically a cause has many valiant losers until they finally win.

1344047340366262272 2020-12-30 06:27:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> What a morbid person.
1344044270454534145 2020-12-30 06:14:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf A problem with modern egalitarianism is the only way to distinguish yourself ultimately is money. A solid class structure allows for other means of attaining and maintaining social prominence besides collecting cash.
1344043382310633474 2020-12-30 06:11:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf I figured probably not, but I didn’t see anything that fit better.
1344042910069751808 2020-12-30 06:09:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I have a phone number that is associated with at least three South Carolina Democrats.

1344041088118628355 2020-12-30 06:02:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed I wonder how many people know that’s what they’re doing.
1344021156072988673 2020-12-30 04:43:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It is absolutely essential that you interpret even the most “out of this world” phenomenon with a material universe, no matter how irrational it is to do so, in order for the plot to have a chance to succeed. Even the putatively religious have a tendency to do this now.
1344020451417350149 2020-12-30 04:40:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you associate angelic beings (both demons and angels) with the modern alien phenomenon, it makes sense in light of ancient mythology and the True History contained in Genesis. It also makes sense of why materialism is such an important aspect of modern Anti-Christianity.
1344017764558778370 2020-12-30 04:29:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @that_Brev It used to spook me too, until I realized I have total control over them. Fun fact: Christians are above angels (and, by extension, demons) in the universal pecking order.
1344003033173270529 2020-12-30 03:31:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @that_Brev Why? Jesus has already beat them.
1343994686302773253 2020-12-30 02:57:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Yes, aliens are actually demons.
1343981824230502407 2020-12-30 02:06:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Maybe this would have worked like 30 years ago, but then it wasn’t politically viable for other reasons.
1343973749650026496 2020-12-30 01:34:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LarryJB33 The lone walker with a mask is a real treat.
1343972919815385090 2020-12-30 01:31:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RCNonsense Mariolaters be nuts man.
1343972632430051330 2020-12-30 01:30:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Christianity is about reaching out to the outcast. Unless they’re outcast for right wing opinions, then you have to make snide remarks about them and not engage them at all.
1343970816686481410 2020-12-30 01:23:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan So, 17th Century Anglicans were right about the Jesuit menace.
1343970716413272064 2020-12-30 01:22:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LarryJB33 Never, because I’m a Catholick.
1343968832134803458 2020-12-30 01:15:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad The White guy sounds like what we’d say ca. 2000.
1343966645421830145 2020-12-30 01:06:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It seems to me the Scriptures are a more consistent source of doctrinal unity on the key point of homosexual behavior than ecclesiastical authority is.

1343959051844120577 2020-12-30 00:36:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 That would just be nuts. Still think Salvini would make a good PM, though.
1343958570472247296 2020-12-30 00:34:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 It’s just going to be crazy when Lega leads the right wing coalition with FDL second.
1343957336067608578 2020-12-30 00:29:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 It just looks like the right is going to slaughter in the next Italian election. FDL+Lega getting to 40% without even the help of Forza.
1343956560477888512 2020-12-30 00:26:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 Interesting that 5SM is still strong in Sicily.

1343810361187823617 2020-12-29 14:45:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReformedMallard Given that this is mine, it seems that we will be fighting a civil war against people trying to make men immortal while @AnglicanMan19 hides in a shell. Interesting.
1343809476252590080 2020-12-29 14:42:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RandalLutheran @brianalmon I like the change from a gameplay perspective, but it was a lot to implement at once.
1343808292779388928 2020-12-29 14:37:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon @RandalLutheran The radical shift implementing both the hex tiles and the one unit per tile rule at the same time really changed the nature of the game a lot more than any previous iteration.
1343805919956770816 2020-12-29 14:27:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RandalLutheran I feel like Civ IV was the pinnacle of the series even though some of the innovations in Civs V and VI make for a better game on a technical level.

1343686561246965762 2020-12-29 06:33:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @samhydegger As a driver, I find them obnoxious because they have a tendency to disobey traffic rules while expecting you to be deferential to them. Having the "rules of the road" apply to them should be a two way street, but it never is.
1343686242869932032 2020-12-29 06:32:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Absolutely. It's like "well, if this is all true, how come your co-religionists disagree?" Christian perspective is that Satan is attacking the Church, of course.
1343685504714366981 2020-12-29 06:29:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @samhydegger Cyclists are the worst. Try living in the Portland Metro: They infest the place, especially hilly suburbs where you can't get around them.
1343685038685216768 2020-12-29 06:27:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis It would be far more interesting critique of Christianity if someone could critique from within. Aside from some half-ass attempts at pointing out "Bible contradictions," people rarely attempt to take on Christianity on its own terms.
1343672260478062593 2020-12-29 05:36:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 However, this would go over like a lead balloon and be an eternal embarrassment to the Royals. Not that she isn’t already.
1343672125647945729 2020-12-29 05:36:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 She is still eligible as she did not receive the title when she held any office of trust in the United States.
1343670272818352128 2020-12-29 05:28:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @stealthymagne They're all just trying to feel super smart if things don't play out to Trump's benefit.
1343666294391001088 2020-12-29 05:13:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Probably mostly pride. They could make pure profit if they just created cheap emulators and sold them for $50-100 in some pseudo-console. People would buy them rather than download an emulator.
1343619680901226496 2020-12-29 02:07:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @timesnewemma @RCNonsense It's plausible, but the textual evidence is not conclusive.
1343618445435432961 2020-12-29 02:02:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MarcusShrinking Could just be the WHO dunking on Trump. In any case, I don't trust any of these people.
1343616554756435970 2020-12-29 01:55:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roland_Gunn2 I think part of it is that a lot of them are degen atheists themselves and trying to deflect blame from the total collapse of religion, even pushing crazed theories about Christianity itself being some kind of Jewish plot.
1343613495707885569 2020-12-29 01:43:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 @BasedNYer1 @Michael_acct54 That’s still insanely good for a Republican. I’m inclined to believe it.
1343612566665383940 2020-12-29 01:39:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @revjackashcraft It’s just so cringe because it clearly isn’t authentic. They don’t actually believe the gods are living, breathing deities. They’re either some kind of pantheist who thinks these deities are metaphors for different divine aspects, or an atheist who believes in “tradition.”
1343609829114466305 2020-12-29 01:28:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RandalLutheran @thuletide @MeldEndCastles Atheists, man.
1343609484573290504 2020-12-29 01:27:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis I’d say the Middle Ages are compatible with a Hoppean vision of libertarianism.

1343029457515327488 2020-12-27 11:02:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @kangfrenly I refer just to the religious aspects. Anything that doesn’t disturb the substance of the memorial is fine.
1343029276975771649 2020-12-27 11:01:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @kangfrenly It would have to be a matter of extreme urgency to even consider disturbing the dead.
1343028716100845569 2020-12-27 10:59:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @kangfrenly There is just something deeply wrong about disturbing a place of rest.

1342959701156376583 2020-12-27 06:25:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @aphoneyname It’s the culmination of the regulatory capture we’ve seen over the years.
1342958247679062019 2020-12-27 06:19:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @radiationorgan I just don’t think we’re going to get very far without a vision for the future.
1342957912755499011 2020-12-27 06:18:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnthonyPunished That’s protectionism. That can take place within the context of a market economy. A market economy can be more or less heavily regulated (I tend to be somewhere in between here), but a command economy is entirely different.
1342957214802313217 2020-12-27 06:15:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is why I refuse to take right wing anti-market people seriously. As in I have zero respect. You pretend to be opposed to a command economy, but then say markets are evil. And then refuse to articulate anything but your displeasure with markets as an alternative.
1342956838552272897 2020-12-27 06:13:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Listen, it’s really simple. You have two economic options: A market economy or a command economy. There is no third option.
1342955570203123712 2020-12-27 06:08:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @apex_pl @HeritageNLegacy Profits are just profits. Sometimes they’re generated honestly from honest labor. Sometimes they’re because a harlot has had a really good night taking mercenary petty cash. When they’re the product of honest labor, they are good.
1342955292271800320 2020-12-27 06:07:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @apex_pl @HeritageNLegacy Something not being inherently good doesn’t make them inherently bad either. Which is my primary point.
1342955033395130383 2020-12-27 06:06:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @apex_pl @HeritageNLegacy The average economist does *not* think markets naturally lead to Pareto efficiency or that there are low barriers to entry or that perfect information exists. If you take the next course up, they, tend to explain the way these markets end up slightly off course from the ideal.
1342954598919786503 2020-12-27 06:05:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @apex_pl @HeritageNLegacy Your article leads to the impression your understanding of economics comes from case studies of basic microeconomics. Any two bit Econ prof at your local community college understands the market doesn’t take full account of externalities and needs some outside regulation.
1342952723000545282 2020-12-27 05:57:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @apex_pl @HeritageNLegacy Like, this is GOOD.
1342952629954084864 2020-12-27 05:57:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @apex_pl @HeritageNLegacy Finding arbitrages is exactly what trading has always been about. “Oh, look, place A has a ton of cotton, if I go there, I can get a ton of it cheap, and then move it to place B with no cotton, and then return to place A with farm equipment so they make more cotton, repeat.”
1342950684228988928 2020-12-27 05:49:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @apex_pl @HeritageNLegacy The market isn’t taking into account negative externalities here, but let’s not pretend it isn’t working on its own terms.
1342950565719011329 2020-12-27 05:49:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @apex_pl @HeritageNLegacy That is still what it signals generally speaking. The reason why we have exported all of our production is because companies can make more with fewer resources by doing that. Denying that is just ignorant. Making more with fewer resources means further division of labor.
1342949629067984897 2020-12-27 05:45:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @apex_pl @HeritageNLegacy Profits are an inevitable byproduct of the division of labor, which is just what society does: Divides labor.
1342949404643364864 2020-12-27 05:44:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @apex_pl @HeritageNLegacy No. The profit motive signals an excess of productivity. This is what makes society possible in the first place. You don’t get cities if you don’t have farms. Farms produce an excess of food beyond what the farmers need to survive. This frees a man to specialize in something else
1342948955647324163 2020-12-27 05:42:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @apex_pl @HeritageNLegacy As I’ve said: The state is at least an equal partner in this dispossession. It is the state’s responsibility to rein in these excesses, and they’ve positively subsidized them.
1342948471377174528 2020-12-27 05:40:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @VeloMontaigne @Blair_A_Nathan This isn’t a problem among normiecons. You confuse normiecons with the center right elite class. Normiecons are dudes with AR stickers on their F-150 who gay “I ‘ate commies and love Merica.”
1342948049753145344 2020-12-27 05:39:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @apex_pl @HeritageNLegacy A far greater problem than the profit motive is regulatory capture. Big business is in cahoots with regulatory agencies. These regulatory agencies manipulate the law to favor their friends. The state is at least an equal partner in this evil.
1342947410167869440 2020-12-27 05:36:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @apex_pl @HeritageNLegacy The solutions I have seen advocated are arbitrary and confiscatory taxation, the punishment of the genuinely productive, and the vesting of ever more power in a central government in a pseudo command economy. Actual solutions are the legal protection of families and their wealth.
1342946944642146306 2020-12-27 05:34:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @apex_pl @HeritageNLegacy This is a temporary profit boost at best. My problem here isn’t with any and all economic regulation, it’s that you are attacking the profit motive itself, which is the driver of economic advancement. And economic prosperity is itself a good thing...
1342946168968503299 2020-12-27 05:31:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Let me give you another hint: The problem is sin and greed, not making a lot of money and not taxing it enough.
1342944868079964160 2020-12-27 05:26:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @apex_pl @HeritageNLegacy Material prosperity, when an end of itself, is obviously the cause of much evil. But it isn’t evil in and of itself, and this isn’t a result of market economics or a low tax rate. This is a result of a vile and wicked people.
1342944318122831883 2020-12-27 05:24:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @apex_pl @HeritageNLegacy Your problem is religious and cultural in nature, not economic. Your misdiagnosing the whole problem and blaming it on something that makes zero sense historically. What exactly is “capital” here? You’re attacking material prosperity, which is a byproduct of productive families.
1342939339844685824 2020-12-27 05:04:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy By giving them exactly what they want?
1342938353122107392 2020-12-27 05:00:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @EyeballFlaming They are intensely pragmatist at least.
1342936544794062849 2020-12-27 04:53:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy If you don’t think fighting communism was a worthy cause, you’re actually evil.
1342929582169747464 2020-12-27 04:25:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeracleanVision Capital properly speaking is the means of production, which don’t have moral agency.
1342928091899965441 2020-12-27 04:19:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Like, seriously, when you rant about the evils of “capital,” you sound like a Marxist. Stop.
1342927646120943621 2020-12-27 04:17:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The proper right-wing turn of phrase is not “capital,” but “monied elite.”
1342927295716225024 2020-12-27 04:16:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @VeloMontaigne @Blair_A_Nathan Yes, and a huge cause of capital flight is regulatory capture and normiecons do not “fellate capital.” You sound like a leftist yourself when you insult ordinary people like this.
1342923939723546627 2020-12-27 04:03:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @VeloMontaigne @Blair_A_Nathan I see many in our corner end up attacking the concepts of private property itself and advocating something that is essentially socialism itself or otherwise advocating arbitrary wealth or income caps. These are band aids at best and the arbitrary use of force is never ideal.
1342923618339213313 2020-12-27 04:01:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @VeloMontaigne @Blair_A_Nathan My problem is that in this corner is that countersignaling normie conservatives on this point leads to arbitrary and often just flat leftist solutions to the underlying problem. Normie conservatives are essentially correct that the problem is with state regulatory capture.
1342909386071695361 2020-12-27 03:05:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> ...Among the priestly order, the actual priests have been displaced by the academic and the scientific community. The courageous warrior is no longer the common people’s hero, but has been replaced by the cult of celebrity.
1342908939575431174 2020-12-27 03:03:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think the problem the traditional right senses in the accumulation of capital with our elite is that there has been a mass displacement both within the different elites orders and among them. The landed aristocrat and industrial baron has given way to financial tricksters...

1342906528718868481 2020-12-27 02:54:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirGripz This depends on the context. I like Churches that represent the best of their era and place. A simple wooden country Church can be beautiful and so can a large Neogothic Church in an urban center. I do think it should stick with traditional Church design principles in layout.
1342905937993019394 2020-12-27 02:51:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Kane9015 The modern warehouse megachurch is generally reflective of that Church’s as an essentially industrial scale conversion machine. It is designed to get butts in seats, disconnected from tradition. This isn’t historical Protestantism, though.
1342904727391109120 2020-12-27 02:46:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> At the same time, looks *can* be deceptive. Something can appear to be beautiful when it is really rotten to the core. And sometimes something beautiful lurks beneath the surface. This is why it is dangerous to put too much emphasis on aesthetics.
1342904243511025664 2020-12-27 02:44:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> While I don’t think aesthetics should be the primary concern of the honest truth seeker, the truth is beautiful, and the beautiful does reflect back the truth.
1342903725346721792 2020-12-27 02:42:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HoppeanEmo The Soviets did have some sweet aesthetics when they were trying.
1342899432438853635 2020-12-27 02:25:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Blair_A_Nathan I just think too many in our little corner are taking this observation way, way too far. We cannot win the next battle by conceding the last. I agree the people who possess the capital now probably need to have it taken away, but that’s a temporary measure, not a permanent policy
1342899008197550081 2020-12-27 02:24:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Socialists’ highest value is equality. That used to manifest as the equal distribution of material goods. That is no longer the case. Like us, they now have a more holistic approach to equality. The right embraces natural hierarchy, and we can’t just sacrifice the economic realm.
1342897736295833601 2020-12-27 02:19:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Blair_A_Nathan If there’s one thing worse than capital being on the other side, though, it’s having the full force of the state forcing you to contribute to it, which is what any and all socialist regimes have done.

1342670904011186178 2020-12-26 11:17:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton @brianalmon It’s interesting and certainly more compelling than the standard “prophets be crazy” line, but it also leaves a lot of gaps. This shift appears to have been incredibly sudden, at least in terms of a materialist secular timeline.
1342669669149368321 2020-12-26 11:12:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon @Theo_Chilton The problem with this thesis is the underlying naturalism.

1342642139147227141 2020-12-26 09:23:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think this is backed up by Scripture in that God goes silent in the intertestamental period. This is also the period when early philosophy and rationalism started taking hold in many ancient societies.
1342641634316591105 2020-12-26 09:21:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I genuinely believe the Ancients living nearer to The Flood had more contact with the spiritual world and this is why everyone was extraordinarily religious.

The problem is that in a lot of industries it’s more profitable to have hordes of cheap barely functioning employees who are lifted by a small core of extraordinarily productive employees.

Perspicuity certainly doesn’t mean that alternative interpretations might not *sound* reasonable, but ultimately the meaning of Scripture in matters of Faith and Morals is clear.

1342568358303191043 2020-12-26 04:30:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ek07178562 That would be a whole other level of heresy because Christ is wholly man and God, with his racial heritage being entirely a property of his human nature.

1342567549272285185 2020-12-26 04:27:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I guess the ERLC follows the One Drop Rule in terms of ethnic diversity.
1342567339880013824 2020-12-26 04:26:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Jesus was probably less ethnically diverse than the average Roman Legionnaire in the Early Empire.
1342566516231974914 2020-12-26 04:22:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer The ERLC is kind of out of control, to be fair.
1342554420622585866 2020-12-26 03:34:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Like, even if we accept the “results” at face value, this alone is a serious problem.
1342554242360487937 2020-12-26 03:34:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I don’t know how one can accept the legitimacy of a government that would have absolutely no hope of election without “naturalized” foreigner votes.

1341799786794655747 2020-12-24 01:36:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's like Richard Spencer is on a mission to get people to hate him.
1341795303092088833 2020-12-24 01:18:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump cannot pardon people who were convicted of state level crimes. Of the 2.5 million incarcerated people, only about 10% are incarcerated by the Federal Government and these tend to be more heinous crimes.

1341466214267273216 2020-12-23 03:30:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Life went back to normal after the Black Death, but Covid? Truly the herald of a New Age.
1341464894919614467 2020-12-23 03:25:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roland_Gunn2 BigLaw about to become a veritable death camp for young White and Asian men (and even women to some extent).

1341436346305568768 2020-12-23 01:32:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @D______K_______ This isn’t sustainable. What form the blowback will take or if total (counter)revolution can be staved off a few more years are open questions, but I just don’t see us going quietly into the good night like what seemed possible as late as a few months ago.
1341435360182677510 2020-12-23 01:28:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @implicitwahoag Clearly a body double. The real Pence would cause tectonic movement if he were to run. He must carefully weigh every step.

1341427140844240896 2020-12-23 00:55:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HisApostolic @KingofShirgar I’d still think they’d view themselves as a bridge between the Muslim world and the West. I’d still say the Arab world itself is more of a peripheral part of Western Civilization than it is its own thing entirely. Perhaps you could call it two branches from one trunk.
1341425434714660864 2020-12-23 00:48:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HisApostolic @KingofShirgar Even the Neo-Ottomans are arguably Western in Identity. The Ottomans themselves surely thought of themselves as a European Great Power, even if they were dedicated to Islam.
1341417050900754433 2020-12-23 00:15:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KapitalistKhan Or that time we are still living in where some illiterate shepherds have them pinned down for 20 years or more?

1341203488022388742 2020-12-22 10:06:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @s_Bass2 That’s an intentional action taken than will certainly take lives. What we are talking about is the fact lives have already been taken and something was discovered in the process. You’re not taking any other life.

1341187043637010434 2020-12-22 09:01:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NJRespector @ciceromt63 That doesn’t mean there’s no history, though. That’s just a part of the history.
1341185922604347393 2020-12-22 08:56:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NJRespector @ciceromt63 Seems like the Northern Mid-Atlantic states are the only ones that don’t. At least from what I’ve seen so far.

1341181988322078721 2020-12-22 08:41:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Even Julian was really a Neoplatonist. There are probably more consistent ways of combining the two, but that’s for someone else to waste their time on lol.
1341180876844126213 2020-12-22 08:36:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis If I was a pagan, I’d just embrace it: “The world is a cruel place because the gods are cruel. Morality is what you can get away with.”

1341157763767013381 2020-12-22 07:05:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy So do California and Washington. State history, then US history the next year.
1341156740839182336 2020-12-22 07:00:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IdomeneusRex To be fair, if any state is at the center of US history, it’s Virginia.
1341155800836960256 2020-12-22 06:57:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SloyerCo I can't imagine a state that doesn't do this. Most states have a fairly unique story to tell too.
1341155422737195011 2020-12-22 06:55:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Uh...Can anyone name me a state that doesn't? I know California, Washington, and Virginia all do this as well. Fairly sure this is every state.
1341155220622065668 2020-12-22 06:54:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MonarchistSpirt I had Washington State History and California State History as well. I also know Virginians take Virginia history.
1341145530274033665 2020-12-22 06:16:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton That is December 23rd, so yeah.
1341139929468968960 2020-12-22 05:54:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @breakonthru234 I'd say more guns, but the good ones are mostly over $600 now.
1341125067107934211 2020-12-22 04:55:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sweighbar There are, but if this doesn't ultimately flow back into the imperial coffers, it just isn't sustainable.
1341124271184199684 2020-12-22 04:51:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sweighbar That's true, but this isn't supposed to be the relationship an Empire has with lesser powers. If we're not profiting from our presence or securing the defense of our frontiers, why are we there?
1341122655223762945 2020-12-22 04:45:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Seriously, how long can this order survive when the United States has declining birth rates, flagging spiritual health, and weak moral fiber? Many think we will enter some kind of dystopian future where this goes on perpetually, but at some point biological reality takes hold.
1341121436832976903 2020-12-22 04:40:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> One reason I think the present world order is doomed much faster than older world orders is that the imperial relationship of the US is entirely reversed. For some reason, we feel the moral compulsion to pay our protectorates money. This can't be sustainable long term.
1341120768982315009 2020-12-22 04:38:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Who ever heard of an empire that paid its clients tribute?
1341118982900899840 2020-12-22 04:30:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GeorgeBMcGroyp It does have Bourbon and my grandfather is from there and much of the family still lives there.
1341118395350073344 2020-12-22 04:28:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing Most of the people saying CRT is "secular" or "unbiblical" aren't making the mere claim that the idea has an origin outside of Scripture: They are making the positive claim that it is actively against a consistent Christian, believing worldview.
1341117339975233536 2020-12-22 04:24:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> CRT also advocates for immoral acts to be done against White people. Aristotelian realism doesn't imply doing anything actually immoral.
1341116425432408065 2020-12-22 04:20:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There are several problems with this: One is that CRT directly supplants Christian dogma (specifically, that of Original Sin) in a way Platonic or Aristotelian Realism simply do not. The other is that CRT is just not true. Thinking Plato has insights doesn't mean Epicurus does.
1341112217769566211 2020-12-22 04:04:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @4dchessmaster1 People get really confused by parliamentary trickery.
1341111112205561857 2020-12-22 03:59:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I told you this would never pass.
1341108740850921481 2020-12-22 03:50:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Yeah, they have to last two weeks for the big sales, so they're not as steep. Pretty hard to maximize profits if you keep the 80-90% cuts those hourly flash sales often saw.
1341108022681210880 2020-12-22 03:47:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Oblivion2elect1 @realikamusume Trump appeals to a cross section of genuine elites (aristocrats) and the lower classes. He really gets squeezed with oligarchs and the upper middle class. You can see that on this map: Santa Monica/Hills/Glendale are actually upper class. Rancho Palos Verdes/OC? PMC types.
1341106485649166336 2020-12-22 03:41:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I kind of miss old school Steam sales where the different hot deals changed everyday and the hourly flash sales and stuff.
1341104642084769792 2020-12-22 03:33:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm still skeptical of the vaccine, but for other reasons that have nothing to do with the particulars of any testing regime.
1341103141660594177 2020-12-22 03:28:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Let's just say they came up with the cure for cancer, but they ended up killing a thousand babies along the way, is it immoral to receive said treatment? When does the immorality expire?
1341096890507653123 2020-12-22 03:03:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I always love that astronomical events occurring near Christmas have to be declared to be "Not the Star of Bethlehem!" by "scientists" for one reason or another.
1341088711694540803 2020-12-22 02:30:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 I don't really think so, both bad. Clinton really inaugurated the Post-Soviet World too.

1341076680136376321 2020-12-22 01:42:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DKaiserjager Exactly. As far as I know no one at all was convicted of treason in connection to the Civil War. I just assume there might be some espionage case I haven’t heard of.
1341076414762786816 2020-12-22 01:41:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Leftists: The Confederates were TRAITORS! We should purge their memory!  Also Leftists: If you can’t get a judge to say so in court, there clearly was no election fraud.
1341075755057483780 2020-12-22 01:39:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Fun fact: No one was convicted of treason in connection to official Confederate activity in the Civil War.
1341059557171335177 2020-12-22 00:34:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Burdman_at_law @MaimsJason @BeigeShiba People complain a lot about video games because the interactive and expensive nature of it leaves us feeling like we should get more for it. Why do I feel like I’m still playing the same game as I did on Windows 98?

There were the equivalent of trash dime store novels in Ancient Greece too: Not everything was good. I do think we’ve reached a point in our civilizational cycle where creativity is at a pronounced low, though.

For instance, you end up learning a lot about Ancient Greek Civilization in English Literature in freshman and sophomore years because that’s when you read Homer.
1341051359672594432 2020-12-22 00:02:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 @GengarJew420 Charles V, yes (not that I suspect most remember). We go over the Reformation and early Spanish Colonization and he plays a big role in that. I can’t recall going over the 30 Years War specifically, but we might have.

1340740252177186816 2020-12-21 03:26:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> “Christian socialism” is a contradiction in terms, certainly when referencing anything resembling modern Marxist socialism.
1340738844178657285 2020-12-21 03:20:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing Yeah, people have no concept of what it’s like to show up somewhere and literally have to build a whole society from scrap. This is an extremely new phenomenon. Notably, Rome faced a similar problem when emerging into its Imperial phase: Nowhere new to build something.
1340737476646871040 2020-12-21 03:14:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It is, after all, our divine duty to create and build such societies and “subdue the earth.” God Himself even creates these boundaries between families and nations (see Paul before the Areopagus in Acts 17). The main problem with NAP is that people are born into societies.
1340736942544187392 2020-12-21 03:12:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Initially, when human beings were scattered from their diabolical plan to build the Tower of Babel, they came upon new and unsettled land. They then variously hunted, gathered, or settled this land and created societies. I find it difficult to call this “aggression.”
1340723214092263424 2020-12-21 02:18:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles Ah, ok.
1340721885450022912 2020-12-21 02:13:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles Though, she may just be severely ill, which, while certainly better for her family, is cool comfort for vaccine skeptics.
1340721736883576834 2020-12-21 02:12:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles Yeah, the circumstantial evidence is compelling for an outsider.
1340721253775265794 2020-12-21 02:10:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m inclined to believe this based on the fact this rumor has been going around for approximately the last 24 hours and apparently no one has heard from her or her family on social media since the 17th and she was apparently a regular poster.
1340717224571658246 2020-12-21 01:54:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @GladstonianLib It’s definitely making the rounds. Media claiming it isn’t true, but her social media has gone totally dark.
1340717042069086211 2020-12-21 01:53:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf Yeah, certainly not for the young. For the old? Perhaps, but that’s up to them.
1340715930507223041 2020-12-21 01:49:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf I assume it’s to put this whole Covid thing in the past.

They are not less susceptible to error. And your dancing around this by calling infallibility a "legal fiction" reeks of hypocrisy. The Roman and Greek Churches assert authority on par with Scripture.
1340708262765858817 2020-12-21 01:18:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @EyeballFlaming @barf_captain @HeritageNLegacy “Surely the ravings of a madman from Galilee cannot be better than the learned opinions of all the Rabbis. He is merely a carpenter!”

1340706848102637576 2020-12-21 01:13:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This was always the problem with the Optimates and why they were doomed ultimately. People suffered all around them and all they could do is whine about the latest threat to the Republic from someone actually wanting to fix something. There truly is nothing new under the sun.

1340542703491309568 2020-12-20 14:21:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @MemeMagician97 To use the example of Caesar again: When he crossed the Rubicon, he had a few dozen Senators, some Centurions, and his chief Lieutenant (and childhood friend) abandoned him for the elitist Pompeians. Talent counts for a lot if it comes to actual regime change.
1340542186845315073 2020-12-20 14:18:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @MemeMagician97 I mean, all you need is a small amount of dissident elites (who we already know exist) who are willing to lead the masses.

1340455829791760386 2020-12-20 08:35:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart It isn’t really, though. It’s a city dedicated entirely to the power of the National political class.
1340455275434799104 2020-12-20 08:33:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles That was kind of the idea. Didn’t really work out. Instead it has developed into city that revolves entirely around political power.

1340054192732442626 2020-12-19 05:59:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis It is amazing we have the independent witness of Rome’s conflict with the Punics to support the Old Testament record on this and we KNOW, even by liberal dating standards, that the Old Testament was in its current form before the Punic Wars.
1340048859217707009 2020-12-19 05:38:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @modestianrite Where did I decry bishops? It isn’t the word of God because of the Pope you slavishly support.
1340040433821495299 2020-12-19 05:05:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @THEbottlecate @radiationorgan The issue at hand stems from rampant ignorance among Romans, which is nothing new.
1340035575395577856 2020-12-19 04:45:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @THEbottlecate No, but that does not mean they were infallible or have their own Supra-Biblical authority.
1340035387213934594 2020-12-19 04:45:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @THEbottlecate No, the Church received the Canon as it had been given. It did not judge it.
1340035209224466433 2020-12-19 04:44:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @THEbottlecate Paul warned that false teachers would come even from the elders.
1340034693236965376 2020-12-19 04:42:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @THEbottlecate They heard the Apostles speak. You are not in that position. And, as I said, the issue is the CANON. To say the Canon derives its authority from some external tradition and not from its own nature is to say someone has the authority to judge the words of God.
1340034198850195456 2020-12-19 04:40:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @THEbottlecate Traditions are to be judge by the authority of Scripture because it is only that we know comes from the Prophets and Apostles.
1340033885263020034 2020-12-19 04:39:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @llano_queipo However you want to put it, to elevate anything to be in a position to judge what is or is not Scripture is to nullify the authority’s the Prophets and Apostles, from whence the authority of Scripture derives.
1340032785495552007 2020-12-19 04:34:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The problem with these arguments is that it effectively elevates “tradition” over Prophets and Apostles. The Scripture is authoritative because it is the very Words of God, delivered from His prophets and apostles. Not because bishops have been rubber stamping it for a long time.
1340030080668602368 2020-12-19 04:24:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @radiationorgan All this question does is relocate the problem. Prophets and Apostles have authority in and of themselves (directly given by God). The authority of Scripture derives from the office of its authors, not from some stamp of approval it gets from other officers.

1339758956277854208 2020-12-18 10:26:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @HeritageNLegacy There was a split in the Triumvirate itself between Ryan and the other two. Walker-Priebus clearly wanted to be more cooperative.

The tax regime is designed specifically to squeeze the working class: It taxes the activities of tradesmen to an insane degree and the well-paying jobs that aren't tradesmen are universally in insanely high COL areas like the Bay.
1339318367610658818 2020-12-17 05:15:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NobleTater @Orange_Eagle624 Why?
1339316319485890563 2020-12-17 05:07:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 @Orange_Eagle624 Yeah, this makes up for a lot of the marginally worse thing it does compared to other leftie states. The problem is the regime is structured so that you can't really enjoy living in the state if you're in the White working class, even if you have money in that class.
1339315197660581888 2020-12-17 05:03:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoblemanGesture Attempting to not be seen as anti-Semitic has been disastrous for conservative Christian presentation of Judaism. We *have* to claim we are the true heirs of the Ancient Israelite religion, but that's anathema to moderns.
1339312220895895554 2020-12-17 04:51:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The main problem with total and complete legal egalitarianism is that it is far more difficult to account for the very real differences between different classes of men, whether social or economic.

1339301388132691971 2020-12-17 04:08:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think the second option functions best when the executive is elected indirectly by the legislature and the former best when elected independently of the legislature.
1339301119042916353 2020-12-17 04:07:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PerfInjust Some would in fact argue that.
1339300964608643077 2020-12-17 04:06:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It seems to me there are two ways you can go to have a functioning republican executive: 1. Long terms (10+ years) with lots of checks and balances. 2. Short terms with few checks and balances.

1339276168156033026 2020-12-17 02:28:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It will never happen, until it does.
1339275925268160522 2020-12-17 02:27:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @RccTurbo These people often come up with extremely petty reasons to deny tips, and in the US it’s not uncommon for brainless bozos to claim “I only give God 10%, why should I give anymore to the waiter!”
1339275345749479424 2020-12-17 02:24:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @RccTurbo I’m inclined to think so anyway. I’m not a fan of petty tippers and the most common place I see them is among Churchgoers to be quite honest.

1339274243851358210 2020-12-17 02:20:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RccTurbo @BronzeCullis The only time it happens over the course of a pay period is a restaurant that’s probably going out of business anyway. Might happen on some really slow lunch shift during a dead season if just going by shift, though.
1339270832087044097 2020-12-17 02:07:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> How do you read Psalm 2:10-12 and not come to the conclusion that governments our obliged to acknowledge the Supreme Governor?
1339269521715175424 2020-12-17 02:01:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Yes, if you’re short of minimum wage, the restaurant is obliged to cover the difference. Many states calculate this on a per shift basis  and not per pay period. Some states do not allow tips to minimum, though.

1339251271270797313 2020-12-17 00:49:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoblemanGesture IMO, the American South north of Florida has the worst of all worlds weather wise. It's miserably hot and humid in the summer, cold in the winter, but not so cold you get snow. The periods of nice weather are very brief in the spring and fall. Just unpleasant all round.

1338728432134467589 2020-12-15 14:11:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Dan722J @SelimSeesYou Other countries have faked whole elections. It’s a bit difficult to do that with our elections, but it’s not impossible.
1338726224126947329 2020-12-15 14:02:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JBFalke @HeritageNLegacy Nah, I’m still technically committed to Latin and Ancient Greek.
1338725863697895429 2020-12-15 14:01:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy When I lived in the UAE, the locals wouldn’t speak Arabic to you because they thought you were insulting them by thinking they didn’t know English.
1338724544928944129 2020-12-15 13:56:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy I’m not proficient, but I surprisingly still know enough Spanish I could probably get by for a while. I really should learn a language, but, like you, I’m lazy.
1338691295322189826 2020-12-15 11:44:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I like how they frame is as "marriage equality" when they're demanding we not even recognize biological parents.
1338645398592888833 2020-12-15 08:41:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @shmoneyman5 @SelimSeesYou Same.

1338644687247335425 2020-12-15 08:38:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I heard the pretender is speaking.
1338634523626639365 2020-12-15 07:58:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @warpfactor13 Yes, and they sold it to him as "these are the best men for the job, look at their resume!"
1338633613605294080 2020-12-15 07:54:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @warpfactor13 The hiring for private and public is totally different, especially for a figure like Trump with entrenched resistance. You can't replace loyalty in government. In private business, you can buy loyalty with success.
1338633168228937733 2020-12-15 07:53:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> None of this would be happening if the left hadn't declared their intent to be positively vindictive towards Trump, his family, and his supporters. Instead they rigged an election and boast publicly of plans to send us to re-education camps.
1338624302804045824 2020-12-15 07:17:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 22:1 is better odds than 32:1 in terms of likelihood to happen.
1338622745781919750 2020-12-15 07:11:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 Huh? Lol.

1338604843724902402 2020-12-15 06:00:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnbourbon98 My point is about the House being the judge of its own members’ elections.
1338604219457220612 2020-12-15 05:58:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnbourbon98 @NRxAuthors I think this is only true in unhealthy polities such as ours.
1338603375395540993 2020-12-15 05:54:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnbourbon98 @NRxAuthors He is dead in the water if Trump is out. He would have been a shoe in had Trump won on election night.
1338603207170404358 2020-12-15 05:54:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NRxAuthors @johnbourbon98 You mean if he doesn’t just exercise unilateral authority to toss ballots?
1338601167388094465 2020-12-15 05:46:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnbourbon98 @NRxAuthors Probably not. At least not without some kind of backing.
1338600757164187653 2020-12-15 05:44:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnbourbon98 @NRxAuthors The legal argument from a Trump Camp person is Congress doesn't matter and the Vice President, in his capacity as President of the Senate, is the sole judge of electoral vote legitimacy.
1338600124612816901 2020-12-15 05:41:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NRxAuthors @johnbourbon98 I have no idea at this point.
1338599941636288516 2020-12-15 05:41:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @chris_lapee The Vice President is vested with the power to count them, not Congress.
1338599782319845386 2020-12-15 05:40:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnbourbon98 I honestly think we're beyond ordinary constitutional or legal remedy at this point.
1338599319482544130 2020-12-15 05:38:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NRxAuthors @johnbourbon98 The elections committee signed some letter. They haven't voted because none are in session.
1338597433228587008 2020-12-15 05:31:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar Same as President for the most part, just on a state level. The Speaker of the House in Michigan called the Articles of Impeachment "shameful" for whatever reason, though.
1338597231637749772 2020-12-15 05:30:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sorrowen Not yet.
1338597046056595458 2020-12-15 05:29:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnbourbon98 I think the idea is to get the legislatures to validate them later, but it does appear Georgia and Wisconsin did make some move.
1338596730447736833 2020-12-15 05:28:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If the State Legislatures choose the electors, I don't see how you can make a statute that the Governor has to sign off on it. Like, who gives a rat's ass what the Governor thinks?
1338593337583001610 2020-12-15 05:14:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar We’re really beyond constitutional remedy. Not legal remedy, but constitutional remedy.
1338586533616562181 2020-12-15 04:47:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Make it so.
1338584873293000705 2020-12-15 04:41:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> In order for this to work, you’d need to stagger the two year terms. But that could still lead to the problem of a majority refusing to seat minority party members and coming up with BS reasons why.
1338584414998159362 2020-12-15 04:39:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There’s just a huge gap here.
1338584280818216962 2020-12-15 04:38:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Chief problem: Who is the House when its term expires? Who judges the elections to the new House if it doesn’t exist?
1338583961027694593 2020-12-15 04:37:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The idea Congress is the sole judge of its own elections:  1. Lends credence to the idea the VP is the sole judge in the electoral college.  2. Could lead to a lot of problems.
1338581879235162117 2020-12-15 04:29:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @followingstaars @ruintal Not an argument.
1338581350442528770 2020-12-15 04:27:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @followingstaars @ruintal I was unaware counting electoral votes was a commercial transaction. Someone should warn the FBI about potential election influencing bribery.
1338580276969136128 2020-12-15 04:23:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @followingstaars Like I said, not the Constitution.
1338580190457434112 2020-12-15 04:22:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @followingstaars @ruintal That is not the Constitution.
1338579493657726976 2020-12-15 04:19:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FrenlyKang That is the Electoral Count Act, not the Constitution.
1338579350623543309 2020-12-15 04:19:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @followingstaars That is not the Constitution.
1338579248395788291 2020-12-15 04:18:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @romeo_not Doesn’t matter now. There’s a Republican slate submitted from a deciding number of states.
1338578991779864583 2020-12-15 04:17:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Doesn’t anticipate disputed electors. Just provides provision for a contingent election if no one gets a majority of the electors.
1338578842752061448 2020-12-15 04:17:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The most plain meaning seems to indicate the President of the Senate is the final arbiter. Even that is only an inference.
1338578569023385601 2020-12-15 04:16:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There is absolutely zero constitutional provision for disputed electors. It doesn’t exist. Doesn’t even anticipate the possibility.
1338577581214474242 2020-12-15 04:12:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden171 It is. Majority leader determines scheduling.
1338573634525421574 2020-12-15 03:56:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If there is no VP, who is majority leader in a 50-50 Senate?
1338573482989391874 2020-12-15 03:56:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FrenlyKang What happens in a 50-50 Senate with no VP, though?
1338573137869467652 2020-12-15 03:54:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FrenlyKang The VP would take over presumably. They can then nominate a replacement VP.
1338572751641210886 2020-12-15 03:53:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FrenlyKang @BigotsBlow If the precedent is followed, it goes to contingent election with only Trump eligible (barring faithless electors). If I were Democrats, I’d send in one faithless elector on purpose for this scenario.
1338571798309429257 2020-12-15 03:49:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FrenlyKang @BigotsBlow 3 were not faithless and voted for Greeley anyway.
1338571702498959367 2020-12-15 03:48:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FrenlyKang The House couldn’t vote for Harris because she’d have received no votes. We’d be subject to Trump/Harris Admin by law in this scenario.
1338571411422650369 2020-12-15 03:47:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BigotsBlow @FrenlyKang The only precedent we have for a dead man receiving votes, his votes were not counted.
1338570320790302720 2020-12-15 03:43:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Remember when he said this was “impossible.” So, he was LYING for a whole six weeks about that.
1338561138922020866 2020-12-15 03:06:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Has Elon Musk developed the Tesla Tank yet?
1338559646127239173 2020-12-15 03:01:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright I don’t think government in general derives its just power from the consent of the governed. It is divinely instituted.
1338558588151795713 2020-12-15 02:56:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright However, I think it does apply generally to governments. I.e., it can apply even to a pagan government when it is not forcing you to commit immorality.
1338558376146595840 2020-12-15 02:56:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright The problem with deeply corrupt governments is that legitimacy disputes inevitably arise and it's prudential whose side you pick if you pick any at all. Most of the disputes in Rome were of no concern to Christians: Who cares which new pagan general is raised to Augustus?
1338556860316741633 2020-12-15 02:49:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> My main point with this is that it doesn't really tell you who to listen to and obey in the case of disputing authorities and it certainly doesn't oblige you to obey laws that demand you engage in immoral behavior.
1338555856858836992 2020-12-15 02:46:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @GaSecofState They didn't even publish the hand recount results. It was that big of a sham.
1338555694040178689 2020-12-15 02:45:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @VAJackson1611 I wanted to add that given my monarchist sympathies, but wanted to appeal to a wider audience.
1338555128727670786 2020-12-15 02:43:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If nothing will come of the competing electors, why lock the doors?
1338554570176401412 2020-12-15 02:40:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> What a freaking snob.
1338554440920555524 2020-12-15 02:40:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar What do you mean?
1338543729678954500 2020-12-15 01:57:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> From there, GOP states should send members for the vacant seats in the rump Congress to form a quorum.
1338543404112863234 2020-12-15 01:56:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The proper course of action from here is to send in the Trump electors, continue all challenges, then dispute in Congress. When the Democrats likely force the Biden electors to be counted, the dissenting GOPers should leave and form a rump Congress.
1338541584653160452 2020-12-15 01:49:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @modestianrite Do you dispute what I said?   The “authority” isn’t always clear and there are certainly cases where you MUST disobey authority.
1338539797095264261 2020-12-15 01:42:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> His early reign was characterized by eliminating secret trials and restoring some Senatorial authority.

1338531836327301120 2020-12-15 01:10:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I see no other recourse and Trump is our chief still. He has no choice if courts do not grant remedy for an unlawful election conducted in secret.
1338531220272111621 2020-12-15 01:08:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So, elections can be run in this country without any regard to the law and you have no recourse. There is no law in this country.
1338529470647562240 2020-12-15 01:01:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim If they don’t rule for Trump, it’s fastest overturning of precedent in history.

1338519356872011776 2020-12-15 00:20:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 Seems to be the case. The purging of the adjudication log itself should invalidate the election wherever this occurred.
1338518951253471234 2020-12-15 00:19:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "Christian nationalism" is fundamentally part of Protestantism. It's why the Reformers believed in worship in the common tongue.
1338518376512098306 2020-12-15 00:17:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Weirdest part of this report: The adjudication log from 2020 was purged.

1338488680751751168 2020-12-14 22:19:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 EU has been trying to punish the tech giants since the 90s. In the 90s it was mostly to piss off America, though.
1338370370760531970 2020-12-14 14:28:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing Hence why it would be foolish on Trump’s part to pardon him at this moment. Trump cannot risk further alienating people in the government at this moment.
1338369600744992768 2020-12-14 14:25:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing This is honestly why we need to start totally fresh here. Only when the hostile permanent government actors are removed or totally surrender can this happen in a healthy way. If Trump just pardons him on the way out the door, he'd still be in danger here.
1338369019510976512 2020-12-14 14:23:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StValentine_ Trump can't afford to pardon him until after all the accounts are settled and he's out on top.
1338368741860659201 2020-12-14 14:22:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 My point is that the law he broke is a just law.
1338368613015752706 2020-12-14 14:21:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing This is very standard practice historical when reconciling people like him. He must admit his guilt and then receive pardon. That reinforces that legitimacy of the rule itself. We obviously must protect classified information.
1338368126606512129 2020-12-14 14:20:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 While our deep state is utterly corrupt, that doesn't mean there isn't a legitimate reason to maintain intelligence agencies and classified information in the interest of national security. No government can function without these.
1338367894242152452 2020-12-14 14:19:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DarkerDisciplis A pardon would be ok, but only after he admits guilt.
1338367725320724481 2020-12-14 14:18:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Talk of him being a "traitor" though is utterly stupid: He exposed a state that had run roughshod over the rules they are bound to uphold. That's why his punishment should be nominal at most. Enough to reinforce the law, but also to recognize he did a service in this instance.
1338366935118073861 2020-12-14 14:15:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thedragonlord99 @oblivious_guy A lot of people want Trump to pardon him.
1338366863353503746 2020-12-14 14:15:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I honestly think an Edward Snowden pardon is an incredibly dumb move on multiple levels. First, it offends the whole state apparatus for the sake of one man. Second, Edward Snowden committed a crime. He should get a slap on the wrist for the sake of appearances.
1338365637605928960 2020-12-14 14:10:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FlycatcherSilky You'll never find me devoid of theological takes lol. However, the fight of the hour is obviously a political one. Exhausting, it is, but not as tiring as modern conservative Christian academia.
1338364980584980481 2020-12-14 14:07:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat The best part is he's an historian by trade. Too committed to being taken seriously by the Academy than to understand history in the context of the active, living God. Christianity is an historical religion, we believe God acts in history. Jehovah is not just a philosopher's God.
1338362664595185664 2020-12-14 13:58:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden Of course, to most of these people, "Idealism" is more of a reason to ignore Revelation than anything. "Well, if it's not talking about a literal Apocalypse, what does it matter! Besides, people get uppity and say weird things when they read Revelation."
1338362363171528704 2020-12-14 13:57:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden It's funny because this is the perfect application of the popular interpretation of Revelation among Theological folks these days: Idealism. If Revelation is an allegorical retelling of apocalyptic events, then it applies even more than just guessing we're in the literal events.
1338360464544325634 2020-12-14 13:49:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Perfect description of the egghead mentality.
1338360162214699008 2020-12-14 13:48:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing It's easy for people like this to just brush it all off. They get to sit up, comfortable in their sinecures, telling the little people whose farms have been pillaged by barbarians why they're being too worldly or something.
1338359749209894915 2020-12-14 13:46:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "Losing America" *is* an apocalyptic event, just like losing Rome was, or losing any great nation. It might not herald the Second Coming of Christ, but a world will have ended and a new one begun.
1338359181565423616 2020-12-14 13:44:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PerfInjust @IVMiles When Rome fell, it certainly felt like the apocalypse for the people living through it.
1338358971686641665 2020-12-14 13:43:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I can always rely on Miles to come through with the conservative eggheaded take on anything.
1338351847053078529 2020-12-14 13:15:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Blackpills are illegal.
1338350610341629954 2020-12-14 13:10:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy I'm making a generalization here about Anglo culture not some scientifically exacting one drop rule. The "stiff upper lip" attitude of modern Anglosphere society is incredibly Stoic in its acceptance of a hostile state of affairs and ad hoc rationalizations for it.
1338349165043183618 2020-12-14 13:04:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JBFalke @HeritageNLegacy Perhaps so.
1338349117949554689 2020-12-14 13:04:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JBFalke @HeritageNLegacy He has a Scottish and English flag and if he's Lowlander, it's Anglo.
1338348886478491649 2020-12-14 13:03:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trooper097996 @ElPincheBoludo Dude, we already know the polls were rigged. There's no way on Earth Trump never broke 50% approval after getting 75 million votes in the year from Hell. Even if he did lose. Your premises are faulty. And also irrelevant.
1338348524518461440 2020-12-14 13:02:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @libertarian_ass He is guilty of a crime and I'm not particularly partial to letting him go scot free. However, I also have sympathy for what he did and it was not treasonous as she describes nor was that his intent. Also, as a contractor, you have no right to go to the IG as a whistleblower.
1338347893334405122 2020-12-14 12:59:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy I think there's something in pure bred Anglo DNA that leads to a higher propensity towards a demure attitude.
1338347587771002881 2020-12-14 12:58:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ElPincheBoludo Oh, I think it was rigged by the Democratic machines, not by a foreign power. I was more remarking on Anglos attitudinally.
1338345848330022912 2020-12-14 12:51:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Seriously, every single one of these right-wing guys who thinks it's beneath our dignity to believe the results ends being a pure bred Anglo. Sad!
1338344858273128448 2020-12-14 12:47:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Democrat Electors' votes got lost in the mail, sorry. Probably shouldn't have trusted it to FedEx.
1338342703562682368 2020-12-14 12:39:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @VAJackson1611 I will not bend the knee to the pretender.
1338342207946944512 2020-12-14 12:37:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This still doesn't seem real to me.
1338328378693332998 2020-12-14 11:42:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks @buymeyarn This is usually very subtle, though.
1338327446639284225 2020-12-14 11:38:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @buymeyarn @PiousTusks These things do not belong on lasagna (well, there can be a small amount of mushrooms in the sauce.
1338326732751982593 2020-12-14 11:35:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @SirDowden @AqBoga Much of Evangelicalism has, unfortunately, been reduced to mainliners who believe the Resurrection took place and haven’t yet embraced gay marriage officially.
1338320210688925696 2020-12-14 11:09:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BasedMorrowind Mortgages or get in with a local real estate investor.
1338276841942093825 2020-12-14 08:17:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BasedMorrowind This is actually a viable business plan if you have the startup capital, which isn’t as hard to get as you might think.
1338273779143876608 2020-12-14 08:05:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LovebugMAGA Personally I’m in it for the campfire songs, so yes.

1338271702019608586 2020-12-14 07:56:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Translation: Edward Snowden frustrated our ability to spy on our own citizens.

1338223332743843844 2020-12-14 04:44:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @PhilipDerrida @CrankyFed "Bibliolatry" is my favorite one I've seen publicly. I've even seen Evangelicals take up that language. "You like the Bible TOO MUCH at the expense of Jesus!" Uh....wutnow?
1338223111318147077 2020-12-14 04:43:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PhilipDerrida @CrankyFed Yeah, people act like there's some kind of "treasury of love" we all draw from and that we need to budget it properly. It's all rather bizarre.
1338222752684257286 2020-12-14 04:42:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BasedMorrowind Well, that's the UAE, but I'm biased.
1338222509951492096 2020-12-14 04:41:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BasedMorrowind To subject yourself to some kind of torture? Proper response is to enjoy yourself. A nice vacation at a resort in Bahrain and flirting with random Euro chicks would be a perfect response.
1338221654883840002 2020-12-14 04:38:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BasedMorrowind Why go if you won't like it?
1338221508062310400 2020-12-14 04:37:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PhilipDerrida @CrankyFed This is always framed as "you need to love Christ more than other things." The solution if you're not doing that is to love Christ more, not other things less (assuming no sin, etc.).
1338221084634738700 2020-12-14 04:35:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BasedMorrowind You will.
1338219164884938754 2020-12-14 04:28:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed My favorite one is the time I heard a preacher discuss how not to idolize your wife. Basically: If you care about your wife a lot, it's idolatry. Something, something, your heart is a factory of idols.
1338218443120783360 2020-12-14 04:25:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 My favorite setup I ever saw was an on-premise mail server combined with Office 365. They set it up this way for "security." I was like: That doesn't work.
1338217984091975682 2020-12-14 04:23:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 There is absolutely zero excuse for an entity like the Treasury Department not to have their own mail servers. None whatsoever.
1338216791378694147 2020-12-14 04:18:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 365 is a security hazard that should only be used by organizations that rely on security by obscurity.
1338206574175776769 2020-12-14 03:38:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_AnHero_ @ClassicalTheis And they feel like they will lose them under a Biden/Harris regime.

1338204477518737417 2020-12-14 03:29:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing Exactly. Also, what relief does he want? To be President? Courts can’t make him President.
1338204231082381322 2020-12-14 03:28:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @UnrankedChevron @ClassicalTheis The legitimacy crisis the American State is facing.
1338203660061454348 2020-12-14 03:26:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @UnrankedChevron @ClassicalTheis This came of that.
1338202498490830854 2020-12-14 03:21:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> A standing doctrine SCOTUS has developed is that Congress isn’t injured by an executive flouting the law. SCOTUS has arrogated to itself the sole ability to arbitrate constitutional disputes and then doesn’t do anything when there’s a dispute between the “political branches.”
1338200765991690241 2020-12-14 03:14:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing They basically can. States can’t sue because “no injury.” Congress can’t sue because Congress can never sue the President. Biden could potentially sue, but that would have to meander its way through other courts.
1338157501741756418 2020-12-14 00:23:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeracleanVision @KingofShirgar No one knows really. Thomas Jefferson unilaterally accepted deficient electors in the case of Georgia in 1800 (they hadn’t signed the paper correctly and he counted them anyway and no one objected).
1338156988879007755 2020-12-14 00:21:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeracleanVision @KingofShirgar He can try to get Pence to not count the electors. Barring that, we’re beyond law.
1338156509679783936 2020-12-14 00:19:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar I don’t get why people are combing through legalese if this is the plan. Obviously it might lend some legitimacy to the actions, but is isn’t necessary for a Rubicon moment.
1338148957294354439 2020-12-13 23:49:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SloyerCo @BrianSh86084519 Agreed, but it should be done anyway.
1338148703505420293 2020-12-13 23:48:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeracleanVision @stealthymagne @hydrocubes Agreed.
1338148040859918343 2020-12-13 23:45:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeracleanVision @stealthymagne @hydrocubes Yeah, AF has definitely earned a place in the coalition here. I think it has its limits when it comes to appealing to older people on the right, but it definitely has a ton of momentum right now among young men.
1338147583336861696 2020-12-13 23:43:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_Kenziepuff @GladstonianLib Yet another study to tell us what we already knew.

1337983110177239040 2020-12-13 12:50:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @miguy02 People definitely attached themselves to Trump. But the problem is Trump outperformed most of these people in their own districts with the exception of a few suburban Republicans.

1337888593856040961 2020-12-13 06:34:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just don’t believe one goes to West Point because they’re into BLM shit.
1337888397583675394 2020-12-13 06:33:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles @JorgvonWartburg Even the lower level officer corps will side with Trump. That’s where the real power lies to start/stop a coup.
1337887537000570884 2020-12-13 06:30:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JorgvonWartburg If the young cadets and midshipmen won’t support them, they’re just old dudes with stars on their shoulder.
1337887054441668609 2020-12-13 06:28:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> What was that about the military being on Biden’s side?
1337886566744776715 2020-12-13 06:26:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed TFW old  https://t.co/4XnjFtEHUk
1337882744513245203 2020-12-13 06:11:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So, I found Gettysburg, but I couldn’t find Gods &amp; Generals.
1337882369307631617 2020-12-13 06:09:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs>  https://t.co/3z6S9qm5WY
1337881526013464581 2020-12-13 06:06:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer Oh, that’s what that was lmao.
1337880259983708161 2020-12-13 06:01:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @EYrnir @LokiJulianus He’s a cuck. He’s the swing vote.
1337880075363115008 2020-12-13 06:00:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LokiJulianus The dude is the swing vote, though.
1337879519068364801 2020-12-13 05:58:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They did bring a case and they just ignored the ruling.
1337878955139928066 2020-12-13 05:56:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m loving the rhetoric.
1337870158992388096 2020-12-13 05:21:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing Not at all.
1337868008451092486 2020-12-13 05:12:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> “No evidence!” “Can we look for it?” *finds evidence* “Sorry, we have to put that under seal.”  Just like the hand recount results that we never received from Georgia.
1337867407398985732 2020-12-13 05:10:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL Will decide that later.
1337849443375337477 2020-12-13 03:58:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So, it’s the Proud Boys who reek of pot lol.
1337849005599023111 2020-12-13 03:57:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 There was steam for about an hour going up Pennsylvania Avenue, so maybe more than that total because that isn’t even everyone in the city.
1337848466987474946 2020-12-13 03:55:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IdomeneusRex Heard there isn’t today.
1337846532704526337 2020-12-13 03:47:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago The scenario where it works, the Church will just do it anyway.
1337846332984332288 2020-12-13 03:46:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Might have been more people than I thought: A lot of marchers.
1337846220501487616 2020-12-13 03:46:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago “The Benedict Option” is basically this idea that Christians should withdraw from political society.
1337844459489390592 2020-12-13 03:39:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m so glad I always thought The Benedict Option was a dumb idea.
1337843721543573510 2020-12-13 03:36:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you don’t think the people attacking Trump are really attacking his followers, you’re actually a moron. Like just plain stupid. How can you be so blind?
1337841948896473096 2020-12-13 03:29:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just want Trump to march around with lictors carrying fasces. I’m a simple man.
1337838940762550279 2020-12-13 03:17:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The best way to let people get away with election fraud is declare any claim of election fraud to be “against democracy.”
1337838781328715777 2020-12-13 03:16:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump just passed by!
1337836824178331649 2020-12-13 03:08:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The problem we have is that our judges aren’t into exercising raw authority to achieve political goals, leaving them vulnerable to be convinced by sophistical arguments of the other side.
1337836315501531136 2020-12-13 03:06:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Thinking of embracing Hoppeanism for real.
1337836110379163652 2020-12-13 03:05:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @knot_agency @offthe_res It was the dudes he was after.
1337834728347602949 2020-12-13 03:00:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden She ran her first campaign against gay marriage.
1337834296065880065 2020-12-13 02:58:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 It’s fundamentally a counterintelligence agency and functions as such.
1337828867445301253 2020-12-13 02:37:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is like thinking someone who buys a “world’s best grandma” mug is disrespecting other grandmas.
1337828639698804737 2020-12-13 02:36:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We believe all nations should exercise their sovereignty and unique identities over a globalist reductionism.
1337828112588009476 2020-12-13 02:34:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This fundamentally misunderstands the nationalist spirit and confuses it with pure provincialism.
1337826713682767873 2020-12-13 02:28:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> For point of comparison: I’ve been at rallies between 15K and the MAGA March, which was multiple hundreds of thousands. This is definitely between them, but many multiples of 15K: You barely notice 15K people in DC.
1337826229857169417 2020-12-13 02:26:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JoeHide09211954 Yes.
1337825978714886144 2020-12-13 02:25:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Because of how many people are just wandering around the city, it’s a bit difficult to tell, though.
1337825482339999745 2020-12-13 02:23:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Between the two main rallies and the random people wandering around I’d guess there’s about 100K people.
1337824975244255240 2020-12-13 02:21:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HindlesKitchen @parkercassidy4 Marine One was flying around. That’s why.
1337822602816000000 2020-12-13 02:12:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 That sounds about right.
1337821862634643457 2020-12-13 02:09:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 Not disheartened, but a bit more angry I’d say.
1337821559050924040 2020-12-13 02:08:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 It’s probably less actually, but it’s really difficult to tell because people are just kind of wandering over the entire National Mall and Capitol area.
1337819879886508034 2020-12-13 02:01:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @emily_nephilim @RiddleguyMan There was one at SCOTUS where Nick Fuentes was this morning.
1337818992921206792 2020-12-13 01:57:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan There are at least three rallies going on.
1337818762658131968 2020-12-13 01:57:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan It’s a bit more dispersed.
1337817846919933953 2020-12-13 01:53:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think there might be more people this time.
1337817656343339011 2020-12-13 01:52:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> How many rallies are down here? Lol.
1337812929501126659 2020-12-13 01:33:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @D______K_______ It is a strictly modern phenomenon to separate religion from politics.
1337766279571263496 2020-12-12 22:28:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @penni1153 I’m on private.
1337758546226778115 2020-12-12 21:57:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Imagine thinking disabling the like will do anything on Trump’s Twitter.
1337649316534611968 2020-12-12 14:43:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer 50%? Uh, what? Press X.
1337601546960449536 2020-12-12 11:33:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @acrimonyand Maybe the SCOTUS Justices are extremely based and realized by doing this we get to purge the system.
1337599779728134144 2020-12-12 11:26:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @acrimonyand Any good reactionary should acknowledge that events are what do this.
1337596029047332866 2020-12-12 11:11:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Do these people really believe the world has just totally changed in 100 years or something? Romans were fat and happy and made civil wars a veritable sport.
1337588968918028293 2020-12-12 10:43:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy He was decent. Seems to come from a similar vantage point as the wignats in this (though, obviously he isn't that) as a sort of reflexive state worshipper. I have a high view of the authority of the state as well, but at what point do you not realize something is up.
1337586401395793920 2020-12-12 10:33:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Brad has been a total bootlicker on this covid thing. Lost a lot of respect for him, tbh.
1337586198160826380 2020-12-12 10:32:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Anton56422519 That was under the condition that I had egg on my face cause he lost in a legit landslide like the polls said.
1337583218892152833 2020-12-12 10:21:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Clarifying: Not logging off permanently lol.
1337583161367261184 2020-12-12 10:20:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Anton56422519 Not logging of permanently lol.
1337576904136790016 2020-12-12 09:55:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> OK, I'm off I need to plan for real freaking life and get out of this damn hell hole. I see miles and miles of Texas in the future.
1337575987102552064 2020-12-12 09:52:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm entering comfy mode for the time being. First time in here.
1337575721280151552 2020-12-12 09:51:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 @BrianSh86084519 @NyerK98_2 @implicitwahoag Temporary restraining order on the electors.
1337575540346281984 2020-12-12 09:50:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NyerK98_2 @ItalianGroyper3 @BrianSh86084519 @implicitwahoag I can't imagine they'd reject it on such slim grounds
1337575239883100162 2020-12-12 09:49:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 @IAmSilky2 @D______K_______ Was gonna say. I'm having to calm her down here.
1337575018688077827 2020-12-12 09:48:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I hope none of you guys abandon the rally tomorrow.
1337574793009303552 2020-12-12 09:47:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @ItalianGroyper3 @NyerK98_2 @implicitwahoag Thomas himself basically betrayed us. Alito and Thomas said they wouldn't grant injunctive relief either.
1337573959764750336 2020-12-12 09:44:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LovebugMAGA Black flag!

1337572923985567744 2020-12-12 09:40:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NewAmer93831160 @IdomeneusRex Well, I hope you already have one of those.
1337572625430802435 2020-12-12 09:38:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @disnibbahereboy @johnbourbon98 @realDonaldTrump Cato was a massive LARPer. Cicero is perhaps one of the most overrated historical figures of all time. Pompey just wanted his own dictatorship. Everyone else was just along for the ride.
1337562186072403968 2020-12-12 08:57:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Republic is dead, congratulations, SCOTUS.
1337559831289409536 2020-12-12 08:48:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Hey, @realDonaldTrump:  https://t.co/BFYSAS1H6c
1337558951903244289 2020-12-12 08:44:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This isn’t the home of the brave anymore and to suggest otherwise is nothing but raw, unjustified chauvinism.
1337557555112005634 2020-12-12 08:39:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Well, I’m livid. Without words. Surrounded by cowards. Dismissed in the most cavalier fashion imaginable. You guys know what I think the next step is. I only pray we get the chance. I’m sincere.
1337544724870275078 2020-12-12 07:48:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I heard. I’m at dinner.
1337529643642068995 2020-12-12 06:48:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Just a reminder for those who don’t believe in conspiracy theories: The media just engaged in a four year effort to suppress the breadth and depth of Trump support while giving credence to the most ludicrous claims of disloyalty on his part. You know this. We all know this.
1337528850687864832 2020-12-12 06:45:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> RIGGED ELECTION!!
1337527253593362432 2020-12-12 06:38:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 It is, I agree. He’s doing a good job.
1337524716555407363 2020-12-12 06:28:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Ted Cruz is really hustling these days to be a likable, funny guy.
1337524239910494210 2020-12-12 06:26:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @penni1153 As far as I know, Communists weren’t so crude as to forbid beach visits.
1337523828814192643 2020-12-12 06:25:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ColumbiaBugle You should note that the Veto comes with a “Veto address” that is supposed to be read before the vote. These have proven persuasive in the past.
1337522410342535170 2020-12-12 06:19:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Lady, I don’t care about your life story. What did you see at the recount that causes you to testify?
1337522136177664001 2020-12-12 06:18:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedPolitics2 @bravoole2 Nobody is really free of optical considerations.
1337521078596472834 2020-12-12 06:14:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedPolitics2 @bravoole2 That wouldn't be good optics.
1337520379171102723 2020-12-12 06:11:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I love how suddenly all these weak kneed Republicans who voted over and over to renew the Patriot Act and other arrogations of Federal power are suddenly strict Federalists over actual corruption at a state level.
1337519717603553281 2020-12-12 06:08:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @yemanouspeak Yeah, this is an opportunity to set precedent and accumulate for themselves more power. Part of the reason this system doesn't work the way it was intended: We're dependent on SCOTUS to not give itself more power lol. The left deserves a taste of their own meds on this front.
1337519328686641152 2020-12-12 06:07:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tempusRevocatus @pegobry @JamesDelingpole Just look at their political donations. It's still like 2:1 D, but that's another universe compared to other tech firms and I guarantee the 1 comes from the engineers while the 2 is focused on the higher echelons.
1337518132152442881 2020-12-12 06:02:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pegobry @JamesDelingpole Oracle is the most red tech company.
1337516816562868230 2020-12-12 05:57:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @JorgvonWartburg That’s my best guess, but it might be better than 50/50 by Monday honestly.
1337516266987397120 2020-12-12 05:55:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 I tend to agree. However, if they grant a hearing, I’m not sure what they’re going to say if they said with Biden. Like, how is a conservative going to defend that on constitutional principles?
1337515384216358916 2020-12-12 05:51:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JorgvonWartburg I tend to think Monday morning is the 50-50. Favors us by Monday afternoon into Wednesday.
1337515009711235072 2020-12-12 05:50:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bravoole2 Yes. They can deny a hearing and deny injunctive relief.
1337514644072763392 2020-12-12 05:48:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @yemanouspeak The more carefully the consider the case, the better Texas’s case looks IMO. Once you get over the initial hurdle of getting them to listen, the fact the defendant replies are so terse will come through.
1337514224675909637 2020-12-12 05:46:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @disnibbahereboy Agreed.
1337513263936966656 2020-12-12 05:43:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JorgvonWartburg Nah, if they wait until Monday, we’re good. This eventually reverses starring midweek next week.
1337512664604569604 2020-12-12 05:40:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m actually of the opinion the longer the SCOTUS doesn’t say anything, the less likely they are to dismiss it out of hand.
1337510219803484171 2020-12-12 05:31:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @extradeadjcb Partially, perhaps. The poor and working class in the UK also had a much poorer diet and dental care than the colonies. Poor diet in your youth can lead to long term and generational looks issues. The upper classes in the UK look much better by comparison.
1337508768897183745 2020-12-12 05:25:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 They still need to strike down Act 77.
1337507790651322370 2020-12-12 05:21:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Where are all the left-wing astrologers to inform us that this is incredibly inauspicious.
1337506942332309509 2020-12-12 05:17:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles I'm inclined to agree. Executive Privilege is what they should invoke if there's a legitimate state secret at play.
1337504749298573312 2020-12-12 05:09:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal Imagine if they actually did that, though. It's a declaration of war.

1337498039896985603 2020-12-12 04:42:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 People usually don't publicly pressure the court too much before a decision like this because they are wont to buck people who do that.
1337497424563228672 2020-12-12 04:40:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "So, how you doing?"  *crickets for 24 hours*  "By the powers vested in us by the Constitution, the Senate, and God, we declare this election RIGGED!"
1337496535437893634 2020-12-12 04:36:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lorien19731 @ComfortablySmug Presidents do this a lot. Usually they do it when Christmas falls on the weekend or Friday or Monday. Trump has done it every year. Kind of annoying for us contractors because we can't work and we can't charge holiday.
1337496342554357763 2020-12-12 04:35:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ComfortablySmug @revprez He does this every year....
1337496154079031298 2020-12-12 04:35:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 I think it's the election commission, not the legislature. Could be wrong, though. He's clearly the point man for Wisconsin GOP on the fraud.
1337495987582078978 2020-12-12 04:34:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's all LARPing until one day it becomes just LA.

1337495016252583937 2020-12-12 04:30:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MosleyGang @SelimSeesYou Politicians have been doing this crap from time immemorial. Listening about the political chaos of Caesar crossing the Rubicon is embarrassing. Most of those Senators were incredibly weak. And I dare say that was a much less supine generation than ours.
1337494640375816192 2020-12-12 04:29:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 Clarence Thomas, for the majority: "Brian Kemp, have a seat."
1337493419804024834 2020-12-12 04:24:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago Republican member of the Wisconsin Election Commission. He apparently sounds like THE guy for election fraud. Been researching it and fighting it for decades. Citing events from all sorts of elections and showing why these results are very suspect.
1337493193525518337 2020-12-12 04:23:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 He apparently did a research report into the 1960 election and documented the fraud. He's been on the voter fraud beat for a long time. This is his jam.
1337492977179123712 2020-12-12 04:22:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou They should, but SCOTUS saying "yeah, Texas is right" will give them the political capital they need to push this over the top.
1337492410784509953 2020-12-12 04:20:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This Bob Spindell guy in Wisconsin is amazing.
1337486042119737351 2020-12-12 03:54:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "Acting now, once, removes any incentive for future lawlessness. Injunctions and/or acts of executive fiat that undermine the lawful election process will cease if the Court acts now."
1337485921248272385 2020-12-12 03:54:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Another salient point in support of this from Texas:   "Not acting incentivizes further lawlessness and will drive honest voters from the polls: why should anyone vote if a few urban centers will manufacture an unlawful and insuperable vote margin?"
1337483947467485191 2020-12-12 03:46:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @implicitwahoag @ItalianGroyper3 So did Michigan.

1337481615786774533 2020-12-12 03:37:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 Probably just heard about it this morning.
1337479933271093248 2020-12-12 03:30:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The big argument for dismissal is that it will lead to states suing each other every election over minor issues. Extremely doubtful. SCOTUS setting a precedent against election fraud of this variety will more likely end these lawless (and regular) practices for a generation.
1337479536758435843 2020-12-12 03:29:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Texas's most salient point in the response is this: "Far from condemning this and other courts to perpetual litigation, action here will stanch the flood of election-season litigation."  Settle this now and run elections cleanly from here on, or be burdened by nonsense suits.
1337477525568679937 2020-12-12 03:21:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @i_aver If there's one thing I've learned, it's that bureaucrats are lazy.
1337475814296842241 2020-12-12 03:14:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There's a website where you can sign up for "Confederate Citizenship" and pay money to the "occupied" Confederate government. If that isn't a Fed op, I don't know what is.
1337475614652198916 2020-12-12 03:13:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LovebugMAGA They should called themselves "True California" and "True Nevada."
1337473411539472385 2020-12-12 03:04:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @OVonReuenthal It did explain why I never got below a B+ on a paper, though.
1337473277879586818 2020-12-12 03:04:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @OVonReuenthal I went to a community college and then Liberty University. I have no idea why Bible majors were utterly incapable of using Chicago style or understanding what a peer-reviewed journal was.  Fun fact: These kids are mostly youth pastors now.
1337472738483695621 2020-12-12 03:02:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep I am shocked. Shocked I tell you!
1337472368202178564 2020-12-12 03:00:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal At least they're citing sources. When I'd peer review papers for classmates, I was utterly appalled by their lack of sources (nearly always below minimum) and lack of readable formatting on the sources they did cite.
1337471698350845955 2020-12-12 02:57:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The boycott is definitely the difference maker in the Perdue race. Not sure what's going on with Loeffler, the big difference is she does a lot more poorly with Hispanics. She's actually doing better with Blacks somehow.
1337464628662726661 2020-12-12 02:29:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaloTrope Protestants don't believe you get to make up your own allegorical interpretation of the Bible to dismiss parts of it you don't like. It's against the very nature of Protestantism itself. That's why literally no magisterial Reformer disagreed on what I've said here.
1337463345251815425 2020-12-12 02:24:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @shuggabumfairy @C4SO I'm the big gay.
1337462769998848003 2020-12-12 02:22:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaloTrope If you think something "sounds heinous," the problem is YOU, not the words of Scripture, and you are not free to come up with an allegorical interpretation about why it isn't real. It was certainly real when He gave it to the Ancient Israelites.
1337462554885550080 2020-12-12 02:21:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaloTrope You're equivocating on prophetic use of figurative language, direct divine command, and moral example. The Mosaic legal code was an actual legal code of an actual people, to be used as a legal code. A God given legal code could not have commended that which is immoral.
1337461666318077952 2020-12-12 02:18:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jamesdkclark We have no concept of context in modern life. Things can be perfectly normal or even laudatory in one settings and bizarre in another. We have a reductionist tendency to think wisdom and morality never change in spite of context.
1337460123795656710 2020-12-12 02:11:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaloTrope No, it isn't. It only requires two premises:  1. God inspired the writing of Scripture. 2. God would never command that which is immoral.   I'm not a Divine Command theorist, I simply acknowledge the Bible was given to us by God and is better than our own flawed moral reasoning.

1337455660695425031 2020-12-12 01:54:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @hyperboriankiwi @extradeadjcb Yeah, acknowledging legitimate factual changes is one thing. Changing policy opinions based solely on who is in office is obviously asinine.
1337454939585589249 2020-12-12 01:51:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing And it clearly isn’t subsiding. They have a real problem. Their only real counter is “hey, your Bible says you’re supposed to sit down and shut up cuz Romans 13” or something.
1337454159780605955 2020-12-12 01:48:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @heron313 @JayFiveK They seriously claimed this. Some still believe this is all a Trump publicity stunt. They’re that deluded.
1337453921384722437 2020-12-12 01:47:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaloTrope If there was a procedure for condemning a whole nation to the sword, then it would not be immoral. Such as it is, God gave a very specific command about a very specific group of people. Laws on executing a murder in Moses give a general procedure to be followed repeatedly.
1337451630594289669 2020-12-12 01:38:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaloTrope They certainly bind you from condemning it as somehow unjust.
1337451195166838788 2020-12-12 01:36:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I heard he didn’t even really run for President in 2016. He never wanted the job. All a publicity stunt. He will resign and go away any minute now.
1337450772028657666 2020-12-12 01:34:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaloTrope Others really did not follow his wild allegorical approach that totally dismissed the literal meaning. That’s a really tortured reading of Church history. People found allegorical meaning in what they believed to be actual historical events and commandments.

1337448892707860480 2020-12-12 01:27:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaloTrope I don't think the Mosaic Law was a theoretical death penalty. Also, Origen was a heretic.
1337448618593280000 2020-12-12 01:26:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They're claiming Trump conceded this morning? Uh, ok.
1337448451739619331 2020-12-12 01:25:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaloTrope It is to be assumed Scripture is always consistent with itself, being that it is all inspired by God and profitable for doctrine, reproof, and teaching in righteousness. (2 Tim. 3:16).
1337448158046134277 2020-12-12 01:24:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaloTrope No Scripture shall be interpreted to the perversion of another. I.e., if there are two interpretations possible for a passage, the one that is not contradictory to clear passages is to be favored. There are clear commendations of the death penalty.
1337447774078590977 2020-12-12 01:22:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaloTrope It is. Capital punishment isn't mentioned as capital punishment in this passage. My interpretation is consistent with the Rule of Faith, yours is not.
1337447102201393160 2020-12-12 01:20:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaloTrope You should pay attention because this is exactly what the left does these days.
1337446963231518722 2020-12-12 01:19:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaloTrope The point is that the Pharisees aren't actually the "legalists" they portray themselves as: They are just hypocritical criminals using "the law" to condemn people they don't like (in this case, women).
1337446489493299201 2020-12-12 01:17:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaloTrope One doesn't have to give a judicial argument every time someone does something plainly wrong, as the Pharisees did:  https://t.co/aEnIdajFqV
1337446197599068160 2020-12-12 01:16:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaloTrope As for adultery, in Mosaic case law, there are several elements for a proper judicial killing:  1. Two witnesses (who were these?) 2. The adulterous COUPLE is to be stoned, not just one of the partners. Where was the man?
1337445941113200640 2020-12-12 01:15:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaloTrope Because your error is common and worthy of public condemnation.
1337445774762913794 2020-12-12 01:14:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If the Pharisees were merely doing what Moses had said in the law, there would be no basis for condemning them.
1337445644684963845 2020-12-12 01:14:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> How could Jesus condemn men for actions God so obviously commended in the Old Testament? The New Testament hadn't even come yet, so that can't be the reason.
1337444238850740227 2020-12-12 01:08:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaloTrope Your concepts of mercy are not taken from the Scripture. The Scripture never condemns the use of the death penalty and everywhere it is spoken of, it is commended for use.

1337421576309010436 2020-12-11 23:38:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 It gives the GOP Pierce County, Washington, which hasn't gone GOP presidentially since 1984.
1337421088905682945 2020-12-11 23:36:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 Yeah, it's a bit inconsistent. It gives the GOP too much, but there are a few areas Trump flipped they don't give him. Maybe it's some kind of average?
1337420546984841218 2020-12-11 23:34:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This map seems a bit over generous. Gives Republicans all the counties either Bush or Trump won it would seem.
1337418135092289537 2020-12-11 23:25:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JorgvonWartburg Yeah, I don't think it makes much sense legally. The Constitution is essentially a contract. You can obviously withdraw from contracts. The idea the Federal Constitution was intended to create an entity with divine right to rule over the states is patently ridiculous.
1337417272697171970 2020-12-11 23:21:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @aaronasmyth That was the normal take, but that presumes it was an open question at the time of the Civil War, and that really isn't favorable when you want to paint the likes of Robert E. Lee as some kind of lowlife traitor, which is what the new gen does.
1337415786265243651 2020-12-11 23:15:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @D______K_______ True lol.
1337414571645153284 2020-12-11 23:10:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> And don't you dare even think about seceding! The Constitution declared the Union has a divine right forever and ever, amen.
1337414407354249216 2020-12-11 23:10:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If states with 270 electors conspire to rig their own elections, there's nothing anyone can do about it, cuz standing.
1337413338322636806 2020-12-11 23:06:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Rod Dreher claiming Eric Metaxas is hysterical for his take on election fraud is presupposing political events don't really matter. It is essentially pacifism, which is what most of these "no one should do anything" critiques boil down to on a moral level: Pacifism.

1337407914487795713 2020-12-11 22:44:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ericmetaxas Sick of this "no evidence" charade from Christians who should know better. We have piles of witnesses. Do we no longer trust witness testimony?

1337276975682039809 2020-12-11 14:04:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The last time I lived in a state when a Republican won a major statewide election I lived in California oddly enough.   Well, that’s aside from the two times it was obviously stolen.

1337266793136656384 2020-12-11 13:23:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is why I’m not a “trust the plan” guy. I trust Trump’s judgment, which is different. The best laid plans of men fail. However, good judgment means you can deal with these inevitabilities and roll with the punches.

1337264591689162753 2020-12-11 13:14:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NickJFuentes Technically, it was filed before "safe harbor."
1337264009976946691 2020-12-11 13:12:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 The Presidency was, I think, rarely the target of the fraud. However, numerous lower ticket races were stolen. Part of the reason politics centralized in the FedGov was because local politics in the US was so obviously corrupt and everyone knew it.
1337262962130755589 2020-12-11 13:08:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @JayFiveK It's not the Constitutional Arrangement, but the Constitution itself was produced by extra-Constitutional methods. Kind of the nature of the business. An Article V Convention can be called right now, though, under some legal theories, and then just vote to give itself power.
1337261711699681281 2020-12-11 13:03:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Doll_lifeDan @JayFiveK Trump and his followers exist in a symbiotic relationship. If his followers have the strength for it, he can feed off that energy and steel himself for it.
1337261281812865030 2020-12-11 13:01:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @JayFiveK I said a few weeks ago the legal framework of a Trump Caesarianism is a National Convention in constant session until deemed appropriate to hand power back over to a more normalized arrangement.
1337261004867170304 2020-12-11 13:00:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK The logic is simple:  1. It is the solemn duty of the head of state of any people to prevent a usurper and a traitor from having power over of them. 2. Biden is a usurper and a traitor.   Nothing else matters. We know what the right thing to do is.
1337259695501938688 2020-12-11 12:55:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> When people think Jesus was condemning the Pharisees for having a moral code, they clearly weren't paying attention. Pharisees were masters at twisting the law so it would never apply to them and always someone else.

1337252183071477761 2020-12-11 12:25:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @stealthymagne This was, perhaps, the most well-orchestrated coup in history. Turned a whole election into a sham through cloak and dagger settlements. Wantonly ignored laws. If the SCOTUS takes this, and rule in Trump's favor, it can only be considered a Divine Intervention considering RBG.

1336756799316307970 2020-12-10 03:37:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Right now I’d imagine they’re shorter than usual.
1336750318852452353 2020-12-10 03:11:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @emily_nephilim @GoodFaith_Actor @KingofShirgar Our institutions have already been fundamentally altered. I don't see the point of retaining much in the way of form when the substance has long since gone and, on top of that, the form itself has been corrupted. Whichever branch is controlled by the opposition is hampered.
1336743721111588865 2020-12-10 02:45:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal They have none of their own memes.
1336741733833601028 2020-12-10 02:37:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal @KingofShirgar I do not. I just mean I would if I did. I am considering doing a regular show, the demand seems high right now.
1336740685836390401 2020-12-10 02:33:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal @KingofShirgar Or Rumble. I’d still do uploads on all until YouTube wields the banhammer.
1336738928171380740 2020-12-10 02:26:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar Just avoid use of the word “widespread” or “Trump lost” if you want to stay on YouTube.
1336738301118611456 2020-12-10 02:23:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 I don’t get the idea that it’s “dangerous” to believe in conspiracy theories even if they aren’t true. These aren’t cult groups. No one tells people to commit suicide or steal things because they believe in the New World Order or something.
1336736494057369603 2020-12-10 02:16:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Or you could there was widespread fraud, but not claim Trump lost because of it? This is the lamest rule. Clearly designed to trip people up to get more arbitrary strikes.
1336736120776888320 2020-12-10 02:15:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> “Trump really won; Biden stole the election with targeted fraud” would be acceptable. This is just Orwellian.
1336735741221679104 2020-12-10 02:13:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> That is so freaking weird.
1336735114496270337 2020-12-10 02:11:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GoodFaith_Actor @KingofShirgar Allowing Whitmer to continue her crime spree of ignoring court orders and robbing the people of Michigan when you have the power to stop it is a moral evil.
1336733462057930752 2020-12-10 02:04:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GoodFaith_Actor @KingofShirgar Jesus and the Apostle Paul said to obey the authorities, not "the laws." An important distinction when there's a conflict between different authorities. Also, no morally evil law (or law that requires you to commit moral evil) can possibly be binding.
1336731141198364674 2020-12-10 01:55:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HoppeanEmo File an amicus curiae brief. It’s not really a big deal.
1336730417790136328 2020-12-10 01:52:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @barf_captain ‘Tis true. I like to point out the Leftist Revolution really got underway in Catholic France and her primary opponent was Protestant Britain. Of course, the French oppressed the Church, but it didn’t prevent it from happening.
1336729553243353090 2020-12-10 01:48:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JiffjoffI @JayFiveK That consulate was definitely a part of a wider spy ring. My speculation at the time was that they had to do with the riots.
1336729351673536518 2020-12-10 01:48:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @barf_captain To be fair, no one is really doing hot in Europe.

1336728479711318019 2020-12-10 01:44:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 In my experience overseas, Americans, because we are overworked, tend to work hard and then party harder leading to these wild swings between toiling away and then getting utterly smashed and not able to see straight.
1336727964596244481 2020-12-10 01:42:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GoodFaith_Actor @KingofShirgar The Constitution is not morally binding. It’s a legal contract between state parties, not some moral directive delivered to us by the Prophets of God.
1336727267863629826 2020-12-10 01:39:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GoodFaith_Actor @KingofShirgar I don’t think you get it, dude. We shouldn’t let them have power at all. This isn’t subject to election. These are morally evil people and anything not morally prohibited is on the table.

1336726339781599233 2020-12-10 01:36:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Imagine thinking the Founders wouldn’t immediately tar and feather all these lockdown governors. Heck, so would have anyone alive ca. 1775. They dealt with worse disease on a daily basis.

1336725578452508675 2020-12-10 01:33:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GoodFaith_Actor @KingofShirgar Yeah, they’d probably advise worse of Whitmer. WEAK.

1336724821804273665 2020-12-10 01:30:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I love how we somehow live in a world where Democrats are the party of big business legal protection and capital while Republicans are the party of working class Middle Americans. Total role reversal.

1336722945511657478 2020-12-10 01:22:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK The Houston Consulate incident happened in 2020.
1336722360884457472 2020-12-10 01:20:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @colored_sands Sure, when some random chick you met at the bar does it, whatever. But when it’s people you see on a near daily basis: Not fun.
1336722138712170497 2020-12-10 01:19:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @colored_sands Dude, it’s freaking embarrassing. When this happens when you’re in college or high school, it can be a social disaster.
1336721879877492737 2020-12-10 01:18:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GoodFaith_Actor @KingofShirgar Of course it shouldn’t be used flippantly, but it requires two thirds majority to remove. Whitmer has abused her office in a criminal manner. Of course there’s remedy for that. Evaded court orders. Helped rig an election. She belongs in prison.
1336719894172282883 2020-12-10 01:10:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Dan_iel_Bur_row @GoodFaith_Actor @KingofShirgar Just be a dumbass as far as I know.
1336719384845430792 2020-12-10 01:08:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GoodFaith_Actor @KingofShirgar Abuse of office is certainly reason to remove. I don’t agree Roberts has abused his office, though. Whitmer certainly has.
1336714822688370690 2020-12-10 00:50:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 He’s Trump lol.

1336714441438748673 2020-12-10 00:48:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 He can submit an amicus curiae brief.

1336711169575440384 2020-12-10 00:35:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is like the Dominion thing: The more they hide the machines, the more I’m like “uh, why are you so aggressively preventing us from auditing it?”

1336562604303675392 2020-12-09 14:45:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou And, as you pointed out, they broke harder and harder against Trump. Contrast this with Arizona where late counted ballots favored Trump, but they favored Trump less and less as the count went on.

1336546370455539712 2020-12-09 13:41:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> SCOTUS has a constitutional duty to take the Texas case and hear it on the merits. States are the parties to the Union. Their grievances need to be at least be heard and addressed substantively when they have them. To do otherwise invites catastrophe.

1336497835307651072 2020-12-09 10:28:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This gives us an excuse to put ALL of the evidence we have in one big package and throw the whole thing out. And we don't even really need evidence of mass fraud.

I don't see how you can't be whitepilled by what we've seen over the past 5 weeks since the election. So many have lost faith in American institutions.

1336452947673276416 2020-12-09 07:29:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnbourbon98 The fact they denied relief so curtly leads me to believe it ain't over, that's for sure.
1336451477926187008 2020-12-09 07:23:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think what SCOTUS would ideally do is take the Texas case, strike down the election, then take the Pennsylvania case later and strike down Act 77 as a separate matter.

1336439591612592128 2020-12-09 06:36:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I heard in the "hand recount" that they actually didn't give the hand tabulated results, but the machine results in the second certified results (the falsely so-called "audit").

SCOTUS does try to avoid ruling on state law. Texas has similar legal claims and actually allows substantive relief.

1336436758175752197 2020-12-09 06:25:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal @sorrowen I’ve thought from the beginning they wanted to find a way to combine all of the cases. Texas and Louisiana just gave them a manner of doing that.

1336434531914702848 2020-12-09 06:16:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf I agree. I’d think they’d delegate the task to Thomas to excoriate us for being a bunch of insane rubes.
1336432473153167360 2020-12-09 06:08:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal They have to docket it, though, it's a case in their original jurisdiction. This might not be any different than some kook filing a case down at the county courthouse only to have it dismissed without a hearing.
1336431110000152579 2020-12-09 06:03:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @disnibbahereboy @Hockyluv21 The Pennsylvania case is included in the Texas case (at least the dispute in it). I'd think Thomas or Alito would at least state a reason if they didn't intend to take any cases. Technically, they haven't rejected the appeal yet either.
1336429902250258433 2020-12-09 05:58:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lauraka09619649 I've read they're required to put a State v. State case on the docket.
1336429793391366147 2020-12-09 05:57:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright Consider they get thousands of appeals every year and at most takes 150 or so. A lot of those other appeals have merit.

1336429266871984134 2020-12-09 05:55:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright They didn't state the grounds. SCOTUS denies a lot of cases like this if they think they can address the same issue in another case and there's no way to legally combine the Kelly case with the Texas and Louisiana cases.
1336429020775411712 2020-12-09 05:54:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Has anyone confirmed they took Texas or is it just on the docket?
1336428009956515842 2020-12-09 05:50:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright It sounds like they might be taking the Texas motion, which includes the legal dispute in the Pennsylvania case.
1336427669932683264 2020-12-09 05:49:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @disnibbahereboy Sounds like they might have taken the Texas case instead. They need to issue an opinion here. I can't imagine Thomas won't have something to say.
1336427075268452353 2020-12-09 05:46:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf The Kelly case.
1336426791595106309 2020-12-09 05:45:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Now that's a bummer.
1336426187095220225 2020-12-09 05:43:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 Those checks are as easily weaponized against the law as for them. That's exactly what has been going on for the past four years: These "checks" have frustrated the will expressed in the 2016 election to course correct on failed institutions.
1336425572868747265 2020-12-09 05:41:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 Any classical political philosopher would classify it as a democracy. There are three basic types of government: Monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. The United States started out as an aristocracy and has turned into a democracy.
1336424607864262657 2020-12-09 05:37:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Democracy really is the god that failed. This election is akin to Boniface going up and felling Donar's Oak.

1336383877326188546 2020-12-09 02:55:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Most Reformed people are dorks, but I agree with 98+% of their theology. This sums up why I’m an Anglican.

1336380400613138433 2020-12-09 02:41:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Get to DC if you can.

1336373559946596353 2020-12-09 02:14:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> New suit shipped. Nice.
1336372553397506056 2020-12-09 02:10:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Don’t overthink it.
1336370454274170880 2020-12-09 02:01:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Yes. Next.
1336367746817388544 2020-12-09 01:51:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Nomos_Forever Sullivan is dragging out this process and looking for an excuse to dismiss the pardon.
1336364502410031104 2020-12-09 01:38:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 Big dick energy is even stronger than 2016.
1336361427058233345 2020-12-09 01:26:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is insane.
1336355648397828098 2020-12-09 01:03:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theromancitize1 @SelimSeesYou Not even 1960 bucked this many bellwethers. Especially strong bellwethers. Also weird: In-state bellwethers were bucked. Luzerne always votes with PA. Kenosha always votes with Wisconsin.
1336353816321675264 2020-12-09 00:55:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Thamer72663870 That’s effectively handing it to Trump.
1336351717915566081 2020-12-09 00:47:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart @T51BC Unless they’re True Romans and need slaves.
1336351089952780291 2020-12-09 00:45:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @T51BC Whatever they’re short of I imagine.
1336350647608877057 2020-12-09 00:43:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> True will to power decision from SCOTUS is to effectively hand it to Trump just to reinforce that they are our true rulers.
1336350103548858379 2020-12-09 00:41:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 Not sure. Texas out of staters leaned GOP, but people move to TX from all over.
1336348472598028295 2020-12-09 00:34:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 That's definitely true. I'm inclined to believe the diaspora leans Republican, but the trend here started a long time ago.
1336348298861547520 2020-12-09 00:33:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If there are aliens, they aren't in any federation. They're Space Romans moving from planet extracting resources at whim.
1336345416657473537 2020-12-09 00:22:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Psalm 2:10-11: Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
1336340747499409417 2020-12-09 00:03:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 Difficult to tell really, but inclined it would be lean blue.
1336339319930249223 2020-12-08 23:58:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 Yeah, “statistical extrapolations that make no sense whatsoever” sounds more like a “you” problem anyway.
1336336533930962951 2020-12-08 23:47:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> That isn't the claim, Michael.
1336335364210880519 2020-12-08 23:42:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SloyerCo Yeah, the Founders didn't really envision a world where moving to a new state was as simple as hopping into a car, finding a job, and renting an apartment. This was supposed to be a big deal.
1336334531368865793 2020-12-08 23:39:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The West is really losing local cultural distinctives and our lax citizenship policies are the primary driver of this, combined with mass media.
1336333600321499138 2020-12-08 23:35:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @JohnDoe22628416 State Citizenship could be made a thing: You can move around for business purposes, but your home state is your home state and that's your tribe until you're accepted into another one. The Romans did this.
1336333339171540993 2020-12-08 23:34:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 That's along the lines of what I'm thinking here: A guarantee for both sides to function as they have and a real crackdown on hostile carpetbagger populations in red states. That's the only possible path forward peacefully. Otherwise, someone just needs to capitulate.
1336331809051738112 2020-12-08 23:28:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 Possibly not, but it's the only peaceful method of trying. We can't just keep the same institutions, though.
1336331592499830785 2020-12-08 23:27:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JorgvonWartburg They'd need Republicans to vote to appoint Biden electors, which seems unlikely even if they won't actively appoint Trump electors.
1336331197031464962 2020-12-08 23:25:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> At the very least there needs to be a new Constitutional Convention to address these issues. This is the peaceful means of coming to a new constitutional settlement, which is desperately needed at this moment.
1336330842453417986 2020-12-08 23:24:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think the Pennsylvania response to the lawsuit is half-right on one thing: The SCOTUS ruling either way on this case is a breaking moment for the republic. Our institutions cannot survive much longer in the form we have known them the way it is going.
1336328242500759556 2020-12-08 23:14:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Pontius Pilate isn't supposed to be a role model for federal judges. Pray he doesn't become one.
1336324067121459209 2020-12-08 22:57:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK We all knew this. They're still out searching for our StopTheSteal posts lol.
1336323261022392323 2020-12-08 22:54:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @D______K_______ I guess you can just make it part of any law that you can't challenge it after a day and then, haha!, no more challenges. Sucks to be you!

1336316725235773440 2020-12-08 22:28:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @JayFiveK Not yet.
1336315577284124673 2020-12-08 22:23:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I really felt like there should have been a way for SCOTUS to take the case on original jurisdiction. This also allows SCOTUS to be finders of fact (though, the suit doesn't involve any specific allegations).
1336313947297894401 2020-12-08 22:17:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Trump smashed him in his own home state. Had to be a humbling experience.
1336312541199421443 2020-12-08 22:11:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @D______K_______ If they do take the case (and especially if they rule in Trump's favor), then imagine discrediting that much work over one case.
1336166121804861440 2020-12-08 12:30:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Barnes and Barris were noting that a lot of the anomalies are occurring in areas with larger nursing home populations.
1336164789635207168 2020-12-08 12:24:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Given the proliferation of easy mail in voting and the motive of some people to fight Trump as some kind of Hitler, truly massive fraud could have occurred without even much organization. A few nursing home workers. A few people stealing grandma’s ballot. Adds up quick.
1336155098465120257 2020-12-08 11:46:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep Cringe.
1336148776688492545 2020-12-08 11:21:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> That is sad.
1336148001077809153 2020-12-08 11:18:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sorrowen @OVonReuenthal The way they conducted the two recounts themselves caused more suspicion than just not doing them at all.
1336147482045272066 2020-12-08 11:15:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @acrimonyand I mean, that is where we get the word “laconic” itself lol.
1336127503849676802 2020-12-08 09:56:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar Newsmax goes back a long way: TV started in 2014, but 1998 is when the magazine was founded. Pretty much on the hard right of the Overton Window. OANN started in 2013, but no one really knew anything about them until they became the Trump Channel, basically.
1336116379976675328 2020-12-08 09:12:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @YoungGrasshopp7 Congratulations!
1336106064677384194 2020-12-08 08:31:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @battlethrall Of course it’s publicity.  I dogmatically deny the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence on theological grounds.

1336067601877889025 2020-12-08 05:58:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TrustThePlant @Barnes_Law Barnes assumes Trump will just engage in a permanent campaign.
1336066646746787844 2020-12-08 05:54:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @SelimSeesYou That’s the upside, but is it enough? Will he have that kind of weight?
1336066345608376322 2020-12-08 05:53:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou There’s all sorts of issues with it. And Barnes himself understands how corrupt these institutions are. Radical action needs to be taken, and it needed to be taken yesterday.
1336065093667270672 2020-12-08 05:48:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The problem I’ve had with virtually all right wing opposition to Trump is few seem to grasp how late the hour is here.
1336064600610058244 2020-12-08 05:46:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So, @Barnes_Law almost wants Biden to prevail as he thinks it will be long term better for Trumpism. While I think he’s right in terms of electoral prospects, we must consider the catastrophe that would be a Biden Admin and this whole Covid lockdown and mandatory vaccine crap.
1336051873057542144 2020-12-08 04:56:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon Probably more like Trudeau, Johnson, or Macron. Someone they wouldn’t expect.
1336048941989761032 2020-12-08 04:44:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Really feels like Caesar and Pompey trying to bribe different groups of people.
1336032401500348416 2020-12-08 03:38:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume It definitely makes it easier and harder to verify.
1336027702898331655 2020-12-08 03:20:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy That's the case in the rural South, but not the suburban South.
1336026209210265601 2020-12-08 03:14:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sweighbar It's a cultural thing, but my experience with Southern Evangelicals is they didn't live up to their reputation at all. They're wonderful people, but very gullible and not as well versed in theological matters as northerners and westerners.
1336025095807098880 2020-12-08 03:09:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 I agree, Cobb has evidence of similar events to Fulton box stuffing.
1336024360428179458 2020-12-08 03:06:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Agreed.
1336022739648466948 2020-12-08 03:00:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law I think the batch of 55 actually broke GOP.
1336022281827590150 2020-12-08 02:58:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NateBlanchett @implicitwahoag @RealAPolitics They did in 2016 and have been trending that way for years.
1336022217486983168 2020-12-08 02:58:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @implicitwahoag @RealAPolitics Only the contested states. Trump lost a few points at most in the other ones. Atlanta suburbs are far and away his worst regression from 2016 and Cobb has allegations of fraud too.
1336020877423620097 2020-12-08 02:52:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MikeMericano @RealAPolitics 55 vs 53.
1336020527324999683 2020-12-08 02:51:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @implicitwahoag @RealAPolitics These people already voted. What group of people voted this year that literally never has in the past? We’re talking an historic performance here.
1336019726976356353 2020-12-08 02:48:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SFofficial123 @RealAPolitics Name the last time an exit poll was more favorable to the Republican than ended up being the case.
1336018928984858625 2020-12-08 02:45:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SFofficial123 @RealAPolitics They're a mess that has always tilted against Republicans in recent years.
1336018837268008962 2020-12-08 02:44:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Those were the best exit polls for a Republican since 1988 when they dropped.
1336014600920330243 2020-12-08 02:27:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you think it can't happen here, just remember California has the infrastructure of Latin America now.
1336013092879265800 2020-12-08 02:21:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> &gt;Demands respect for the "free press." &gt;Insults free speech rights of ordinary citizens.  We are ruled by such blatant hypocrites it gets galling.
1336008931508883458 2020-12-08 02:05:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 Remember when they claimed these virtually all Biden ballot batches were “pre-sorted”? Lmao.
1336007387208175622 2020-12-08 01:59:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The more we get access to, the more evidence is piling up. At first all we had were some statistical anomalies, our gut instinct, and a few whistleblowers. Now we have people on tape kicking out poll observers and counting shady 98% Biden batches.
1336005437305532422 2020-12-08 01:51:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BretagnePoint @Blair_A_Nathan The problem is the US is definitely the nexus for this globalist trade oligarchy (wouldn’t call it an aristocracy).
1336002476017848322 2020-12-08 01:39:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Blair_A_Nathan I think the American right is coming to a consensus that traditional American institutions have been hijacked to promote this crap. It’s hard to deny at this point if you have any real traditional right wing principles.
1336002099423932416 2020-12-08 01:38:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Kemp has been talking out of two sides of his mouth the whole time. On one side he’s demanding an audit, but then refuses to do the one very easy thing he could that no one can legally question.
1336001047677034499 2020-12-08 01:34:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Blair_A_Nathan The problem with a lot of these immigrants isn’t that they aren’t assimilating as civnats would say, but that they’re assimilating into Western PMC culture.
1335998941545058306 2020-12-08 01:25:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 @realikamusume Exactly. VBM is indifferent without machine counties. When Oregon adopted it in 1994, it stayed relatively competitive because Multnomah wasn’t as corrupt and it wasn’t aided by suburban PDX in Washington County. Now it’s a mess again.
1335996012293476354 2020-12-08 01:14:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HHHtappedin The average real five percenter (if they’re even real) is a moderate college educated voter whose girlfriend harassed them to not vote for Trump cuz fascism.
1335995302558511104 2020-12-08 01:11:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume The problem is mail in balloting gives Democrat machine counties a whole extra month to harass low propensity urban voters into voting.
1335994765381410823 2020-12-08 01:09:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume You’re wrong. Just look at Washington Elections before and after. Washington instantaneously went from light to solid blue.
1335994311645786113 2020-12-08 01:07:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If mail in voting becomes the norm, this country is over.

1335980484929654790 2020-12-08 00:12:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Anton56422519 The problem is that you should have standing before or after the election. Before because if you can see a reasonable possibility of shenanigans, ideal is to prevent them. After because sometimes shenanigans happen anyway and you don’t know until you’re injured.
1335974417101418499 2020-12-07 23:48:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Oh look, another catch 22 for election fraud challengers.

1335806228769943552 2020-12-07 12:39:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @radiationorgan I have zero moral problem with calling priests father at all. I do tend to think the idea of a spiritual father is more personal, though. I don’t know, Reverend just seems like the more appropriate address to a member of the clergy in ordinary circumstances.
1335805026862829569 2020-12-07 12:35:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV Emmanuel Macron is basically a liberal Donald Trump in that he was an outsider who had no idea what he was getting into when he got elected in a field of deeply unpopular candidates.

1335792745127047170 2020-12-07 11:46:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 On the part of some, perhaps, but the little people who provide their power base are genuinely convinced that they need to "stay home, save lives" and not go on "unnecessary walks."
1335791636513763331 2020-12-07 11:41:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 Spoken like a true chad.
1335791206362701827 2020-12-07 11:40:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @D______K_______ We're kind of in the heat of battle. I feel like it's easier when we're not pretending anymore. It's really annoying when everyone's pretending to be friends, but when the swords are drawn, you can respect your foe on a more instinctual level.
1335790914820825089 2020-12-07 11:39:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Been done to death, but you can see the modern left's war on reality in the covid response.   Reality: Seasonal viruses happen. Sometimes new ones come about. People will die from then.  Modernity: We must avoid life to avert the reality of death.
1335784656646627332 2020-12-07 11:14:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @MahlerLCMS It is not morally imperative to be a lumberjack, but it is certainly permitted.
1335784512790421505 2020-12-07 11:13:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @MahlerLCMS "All imperatives are permitted." Your reasoning here is bassackward. You seem to be under the deeply flawed assumption that one can only engage in morally imperative behavior, but certainly there are a large number of activities which are neither required nor condemned.
1335783567683674125 2020-12-07 11:09:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @MahlerLCMS You're clearly starting with a wrong understanding of permissibility. Worship of God and love of neighbor are moral imperatives, not merely permitted practices. Polygamy would be a better example of a permitted practice that governments can prohibit.
1335782331530010625 2020-12-07 11:05:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @MahlerLCMS This is not true.

1335763964207181827 2020-12-07 09:52:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I remind everyone Acts 17:21 is one of the greatest dunks on philosophers of all time: “(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)”

1335760188272484354 2020-12-07 09:37:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> A bunch of people in the replies said this wasn’t true and I’m just wondering if they ever were successful at anything. There are people (perhaps most people) who, the moment they see success, they try to cut it down. Lowlifes.

1335738625493962753 2020-12-07 08:11:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @OVonReuenthal Like the American Civil War: That was first a war of ideology and information and then boiled over.
1335738456656519175 2020-12-07 08:10:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @OVonReuenthal Geopolitics is politics and I think it applies even less to civil conflicts as the nuclear issue isn't there. All civil conflicts begin as information conflicts and end in kinetic conflicts. Kinetic political conflicts happen when unstoppable forces meet immovable objects.
1335737700020850696 2020-12-07 08:07:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @OVonReuenthal I just doubt this is the case. Due to the advent of nuclear weapons, I just don't think the Great Powers have thought any of their conflicts have warranted that kind of risk. I don't think this makes kinetic power meaningless or impossible to exercise.
1335736582234640391 2020-12-07 08:03:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal This concept of fifth generation warfare being solely information is bizarre to me. Like, bullets are bullets and they kill people, certainly someone isn't going to go like "but look at the info!" when the bullets are flying.

1335720654809821186 2020-12-07 06:59:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @lukeachilds @MeldEndCastles You linked to a profanity-laced tirade from a “scientist” who basically says we are spreading “misinformation” because we haven’t conducted a scientific trial. By endorsing this and sending this, you’re saying we’re lying. We can forgive, but I think you should reflect on that.
1335719347302621185 2020-12-07 06:54:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Pray for our brothers and sisters in this family.

1335717772391837699 2020-12-07 06:48:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @lukeachilds @MeldEndCastles Furthermore, it’s not “misinformation” to express skepticism and want more objective information. Insulting me will go nowhere. It’s also beneath an ordinand to claim we’re actively lying by disbelieving experts.
1335717289103077379 2020-12-07 06:46:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @lukeachilds @MeldEndCastles What does it even say besides “you’re spreading misinformation if you say the vaccine might cause female infertility”? That’s literally the words of the Pfizer CEO here.
1335716390993600517 2020-12-07 06:42:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @lukeachilds @MeldEndCastles Did you read the fact check?

1335705700157231104 2020-12-07 06:00:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles @lukeachilds I just remember these are the same “experts” who deny the authority of Scripture on their “expert” study of ancient history and textual hypotheses.
1335704012792999936 2020-12-07 05:53:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles @lukeachilds The thing is just someone’s rant about someone taking a statement by the Pfizer CEO and believing it is spreading “misinformation.” I don’t take kindly to someone just asserting expertise and insulting people who express skepticism.
1335703333978386439 2020-12-07 05:51:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @lukeachilds Did you read the fact check? The Pfizer CEO said it could cause female infertility.

1335682546483552263 2020-12-07 04:28:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realDharmapala The problem for the law if the courts don’t rule the elections were illegitimate is what is the point of election law if it can be violated when you actually hold an election?
1335681964003774469 2020-12-07 04:26:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BasedMorrowind It was better the first time lol.

1335679960011448322 2020-12-07 04:18:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 Well, Erickson seems to be back on board lol. The Cruz gang’s objections were primarily personal. They always mostly agreed with Trump’s policy platform and the disagreements were of minor significance. The Paul Ryan crowd have had to lie the whole time because no one likes them.
1335676272320581632 2020-12-07 04:03:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think it’s important to rehash the 2016 GOP Primary arguments sometimes because it’s at the root of the current struggle. Still have the same factions: The large majority of the “NeverTrump” faction has had an evolving, inconsistent logic from Day 1.
1335671967337353216 2020-12-07 03:46:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HHHtappedin Imagine thinking StopTheSteal is electoral politics. These guys are ready to cross the Rubicon and proclaim the First American Principate and it’s about “electoral politics”? LMAO.
1335669681097646080 2020-12-07 03:37:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HHHtappedin Israel would have much preferred these Arab recognitions to have never happened. It’s huge emotional leverage for them to be surrounded by states officially committed to them not existing. They’re basically open allies with the Saudis now. They can bomb Iran, I don’t care.
1335666225842622464 2020-12-07 03:23:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Also, need to distinguish between off year and on year politics. Engaging in debate about philosophy in odd years on college campuses is much more acceptable than election (AKA battle) year gutter sniping.
1335665743413866500 2020-12-07 03:21:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Hey, taunting Charlie Kirk has its place lol. As far as I know, they’re not insistent on a Catholic Integralist approach to politics, even if they are majority RC/EO. They definitely are engaged in IRL activity and increasingly so with this moment.
1335664608342921217 2020-12-07 03:17:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy I think they have shown willingness to work with other groups with similar interests and not be overly insistent on ideological purity like the wignats. They’re part of the coalition as long as they’re willing to work together.
1335660139953655812 2020-12-07 02:59:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 @GaSecofState The very issue at dispute is what the will of the people is.

The people who compose the deep state and global elite we oppose are, at the end of the day, just people. Powerful people aided by demons, but people nonetheless.
1335656696354664448 2020-12-07 02:45:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Yes, I am, in fact, a religious zealot.

1335650092079075333 2020-12-07 02:19:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @Smelly_Fingers_ The average Marine and Army combatant is the stereotypical based zoomer.

1335644294162616324 2020-12-07 01:56:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy I think you’re really underestimating America First.
1335643287911272450 2020-12-07 01:52:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW I think .224 is more designed for marksmanship, so shorter barrels are a bit counterproductive. I’m not terribly familiar with .350 legend, but I do know it was designed specifically for hunting and not just marksmanship.
1335486603473645568 2020-12-06 15:29:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I think half the House members on the list are already on their way out.

Trump’s base is strong because Trump has been fighting for his people since he took the ride down the escalator and people are inspired by it.
1335483612372799488 2020-12-06 15:17:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Doomgroyp @JohnDoe22628416 @AnnCoulter She has a horrifying dating history.

I think Trump 2016 is about the only time I ever agreed with her pick.

1335479301098106880 2020-12-06 15:00:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Doomgroyp @AnnCoulter I remember her shilling for Romney for 6 straight years. 2006–12 she was the woman who loved Mitt Romney all because of an EO he signed as Mass Governor about illegals that was in effect for all of a few months.
1335478095235706881 2020-12-06 14:56:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 They don’t understand what the WWC thinks, especially the rust belt WWC in the places that delivered him the Presidency in 2016. Their issue was trade, not immigration and Trump delivered on trade and manufacturing. She’s so last focused on immigration she misses this.
1335476928078258179 2020-12-06 14:51:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 Maybe she’s imbalanced.

1335476355119673344 2020-12-06 14:49:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Since Perdue will technically not be a Senator for three days at the start of the next term, would that make Loeffler the Senior Senator from Georgia? (Assuming both win). Not sure how that would work.
1335474751658209280 2020-12-06 14:42:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @gabrale99 @onewalleee Being disappointed and then rallying when the stakes are this high is normal. Ann was launching gutter snipes at Trump and lying about the wall right up until the election and then turns around and wants us to faithfully vote Perdue and Loeffler. It's called hypocrisy.
1335474253291016192 2020-12-06 14:40:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If she thought the stakes were this high, she shouldn't have ever hopped off the Trump train. Certainly not in the lead up to the election. The stakes in this election have only been raised at every turn since 2016.
1335471713426018306 2020-12-06 14:30:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee It's incredibly odd behavior.

1335337693220384768 2020-12-06 05:38:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 I agree the Reformation was inevitable. One can also argue a Constantine was inevitable as well in Rome. My main point is that Constantine like figures are the people who take a religion and either replace or recover it. They are the catalyst for it to reach critical mass.

1335332794793402369 2020-12-06 05:18:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Blair_A_Nathan Not Mormon, but Mormonism has always been a political religion. By that I mean they have always been willing to change core theological tenets to comport with the political winds of their day. Polygamy and Curse of Cain/Ham repeal being the most prominent.

1335312684594688002 2020-12-06 03:58:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Do religions form around communities or do communities form around religions? I think it can be either or. Certainly the community and the religion are very closely tied together.
1335312435801182209 2020-12-06 03:57:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AqBoga All people are religious on some level and BLM certainly has a religious energy to it. However, I think a connection to the spiritual realm is required of any religion with real staying power.

1335286432584388610 2020-12-06 02:14:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GhostSteveJobs1 I actually had an experience at a speaking event with Donald Trump back in 2012 where, after he spoke, this group of diehards (he had them even then) was in the back. One said to me “That man will save America one day.” She said it with such conviction it startled me.
1335279481519529986 2020-12-06 01:46:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 The Scripture demands that all rulers obey Christ and honor the Lord. He is their ruler. That doesn’t change because we haven’t been faithful to it of late.
1335273561997635585 2020-12-06 01:23:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Anton56422519 In this environment, the Baptists were really able to make a lot of headway because their polity is naturally resistant to such broad catastrophes. This was also after the period when the Baptists became the religion of the Southern working man.
1335273172313235458 2020-12-06 01:21:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Anton56422519 What happened to American Protestantism is the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy of the late 19th, early 20th Century. The modernists essentially won and American Protestantism faced this deepening schism between Bible believers and the liberal and neo-orthodox theologians.
1335271042001104896 2020-12-06 01:13:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 The Protestant Reformation was largely accomplished through local nobility and royalty adopting it. This is why you have very clear national traditions of Protestantism.
1335270700588933121 2020-12-06 01:11:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Anton56422519 There is some work on it in the mission field (they recognize the importance of proselytizing local tribal elders, etc.), but due to Baptist influence Protestants are largely unable to realize the consequences of this for the West.
1335270044616560642 2020-12-06 01:09:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 The model for a genuine revival is King Josiah recovering the law.
1335269809848774658 2020-12-06 01:08:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 There were still leaders, but this is why I think the first and second Great Awakenings had long term deleterious effects on religion. They led to innumerable schisms and the Second Great Awakening in particular is responsible for many heresies including the Mormons.
1335268514945527810 2020-12-06 01:03:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Traditionally, religious awakenings are actually top down phenomenons. There usually is a leader who inspires his followers to return to tradition.
1335268031912620036 2020-12-06 01:01:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp There are simply too many bugmen whose minds are polluted with midwittery and irrelevant garbage. This is why I think the key is some kind of religious awakening. These group needs to purge themselves of midwittery and embrace tradition.

1335264153464938497 2020-12-06 00:45:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is why I think the only way out of this bind electorally is a religious awakening.

1335262229080526850 2020-12-06 00:38:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It’s crazy to think 17 years ago, Elizabeth Warren wrote a book about how dual incomes were crushing the middle class. Even suggesting this now is sexism.

1335115709240778753 2020-12-05 14:56:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 Trump was just the catalyst of something that was already happening. The suburban Republican was never particularly conservative on social issues and that’s really who Trump speaks to. Add on top of that uni hostility to traditional values and it’s just a mess.

1335087446191706113 2020-12-05 13:03:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Yeah, going somewhere that lacks all the pollutants of modern life and you can feel your mind fixing itself. It's not just chemicals: It's the whole cacophony of modern pollution.
1335085965283561472 2020-12-05 12:57:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RandalLutheran I knew it wasn't really serious the moment Richard Spencer started spending more of his time insulting rural Evangelicals in Iowa than the effete liberals he lives around. He's basically just a racist liberal and TRS has followed in that mold to some extent.
1335084345669902336 2020-12-05 12:51:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RandalLutheran I've heard their listenership is on the slide. That would make sense of it.
1335083521602367488 2020-12-05 12:48:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It occurs to me that I've seen bugmen compare religions to fandoms and it's just so bassackward you don't even know where to start.
1335082444412907521 2020-12-05 12:43:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RandalLutheran I haven't listened to anything on TRS in a while, but this was definitely causing them to go down some rabbitholes. I think a lot of atheists make politics a sort of alt-religion.
1335079779486330881 2020-12-05 12:33:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JorgvonWartburg They have their replacements for them: "Fandoms" being basically makeshift religious cults in the lives of many. But these are an even more hollow imitation of True Religion than some animist worshiping his fetish doll.
1335079282008330241 2020-12-05 12:31:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JorgvonWartburg On a philosophical level, everyone is religious. What I'm talking about are the bugmen who don't participate in any kind of tradition. Religio, traditio, worship, community. What is life without connecting to these things?
1335078040804741123 2020-12-05 12:26:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I really just don't get areligious people.
1335077822482821120 2020-12-05 12:25:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @BronzeCullis I've mentioned my family participating in such breakroom conversations. Many of our family friends were from such work Bible groups.
1335077218381410305 2020-12-05 12:23:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @BronzeCullis The education thing wasn't really a problem for the culture overall. It used to be California was probably one of the more learned states on matters of theology. I remember everyone had very well-informed theological opinions when I was a kid. Unis are too hostile to religion now
1335076726506852352 2020-12-05 12:21:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @AStratelates On the positive side for the State of California, it should be noted this is the primary reason Silicon Valley is a thing.
1335076285819858945 2020-12-05 12:19:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @BronzeCullis Yes, I don't believe the law was ever repealed.
1335076062229917696 2020-12-05 12:18:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @AStratelates When the White population became too educated to work the fields and also too dense, had to import Mexicans.
1335075936316878849 2020-12-05 12:18:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @AStratelates This actually is the origin of the whole chain of events that basically led to our present catastrophe with illegal immigration when you think about it. California was an agricultural and resource extraction state with a sideshow movie industry. Always minimal industrial base.
1335075490789515264 2020-12-05 12:16:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @AStratelates 40s it was caused by California offering a great deal for GIs to attend the UC system on the GI bill. This is why California has been one of the most educated, suburban states in the Union for decades.
1335075049146114048 2020-12-05 12:14:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis This is why California aligned with the Reagan and Nixon wings of the GOP.
1335074702579134464 2020-12-05 12:13:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Depends on how you define that. It was always more socially libertarian, which I would distinguish from socially liberal in this case. Live and let live attitude, but this applied equally back towards very religious, traditional groups.

1335068803361886209 2020-12-05 11:49:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Super_Lutheran Yeah, these folks who were sniping at Trump the month before the election and then turn around and question anyone who's threatening to boycott the Georgia runoff have some real nerve.
1335066268588761090 2020-12-05 11:39:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @CantusLaudanum I mean, he's a soul materialist. I kid, though.
1335065969782353922 2020-12-05 11:38:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis If there's a weird set of beliefs at all associated with Christianity, you can find someone who upholds them within the Anglican Communion. Part of why it is so entertaining.
1335065711509532674 2020-12-05 11:37:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Is this @CantusLaudanum? LOL.
1335049278230814721 2020-12-05 10:32:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @partynxs @rooshv I assume he is of relation to the former Governor Nathan Deal.

1335015283124285442 2020-12-05 08:17:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim He “shredded” their factual claims by systematically using technicalities to dismiss the evidence.
1335009251597701122 2020-12-05 07:53:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I mean, why even have election law if it’s completely unenforceable?

1334992823163170818 2020-12-05 06:47:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jefferyclark He says they needed to depose all their witnesses by the 25th of November and they didn't do them until the 27th. He totally dismissed witness affidavits entirely. He also dismissed the expert testimony.

A Georgia County just today or yesterday (getting confused) found their machines were switching Trump votes to Biden: Small amount, but still significant enough.

1334990841715286017 2020-12-05 06:39:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The main argument of the judge in the Nevada order is he didn't think the manner of gathering evidence was in accord with the statute, so he doesn't really address the main claims.

The party has moved to the right on social services? Shut up. You’re obviously a complete moron. Also, literally the only person good on the war was Ron Paul in 2008. There’s well more than that now.
1334958349054582794 2020-12-05 04:30:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mike323a @SelimSeesYou The GOP has made policy priority changes over the past decade and a half. I suspect you weren’t even around in 2008 if you think the GOP hasn’t changed at all in that time. The party center has moved considerably on a number of issues.
1334957786309025799 2020-12-05 04:28:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ToonChap @SelimSeesYou The idea the GOP base has completely abandoned small government ideals is probably the single dumbest idea being spread on this corner of the Internet.

1334957001076445185 2020-12-05 04:25:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mike323a @SelimSeesYou More traditional conservatives are still the single largest voting bloc in the country and they can be fused with America Firsters and some populists.
1334956643340181512 2020-12-05 04:24:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mike323a @SelimSeesYou Because conservatives won’t turn out if they don’t stay at least nominally conservative. They need to be in the top right-middle to both attract enough traditional conservatives and socially conservative economic populists.
1334956050697625609 2020-12-05 04:21:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mike323a @SelimSeesYou I was making an observation of what works electorally for the Republicans. Also, I’m in the top-right, so of course adopting my preferred policies works for me.
1334954925097447425 2020-12-05 04:17:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The Republican Party’s sales pitch is “those people in the bottom left are so insane, everyone has to vote for us.” It works if they stick to the top right-middle.
1334953893491597312 2020-12-05 04:13:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 Eric Trump is the better one both politically and just aesthetically. We all know the true heir is Barron: Our Augustus.

1334943677916049410 2020-12-05 03:32:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If Trump finds a way to pull this off, Republicans have already retained control of the Senate.

Yes, God uses persecution to bring resurrection to the Church, but to pretend this is a positive good is delusional. Persecution is evil.

1334918769831981057 2020-12-05 01:53:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Ordered or urged?   I'm not sure Kemp has the authority to order it.
1334916549593985026 2020-12-05 01:44:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 She’ll probably do a bit better than Bush because of South Carolina, but she’s not even a lock to win that. If she loses that, she’ll be out when he was even if she got marginally more votes.
1334916276792283140 2020-12-05 01:43:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There are people who believe it is our moral duty to bomb Iran to spread democracy, but don’t give a rat’s ass of election integrity laws are complied with in Georgia.

1334912314504605697 2020-12-05 01:27:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RogueScholarPr @realDharmapala This is precedented if one side is proven to have made a concerted effort to cheat, the election is tossed and either reran or, in rare cases, just given to the victim.
1334910520617537537 2020-12-05 01:20:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> END LOCKDOWNS NOW YOU EVIL CRETINS
1334908296181014531 2020-12-05 01:11:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jamesdkclark I mean, his statement is technically correct. If you can't trust democracy, the alternative is some form of authoritarian government.
1334907481332600834 2020-12-05 01:08:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Asking that the President actually be in control of the executive branch of government is fascism, apparently.
1334897731400306690 2020-12-05 00:29:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 @plzbepatient I mean, just look at this guy's face. Clearly a NeverTrump type.
1334897503561510914 2020-12-05 00:29:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar To be fair, this is kind of Hannity's wheelhouse. Tucker has always been more of an issues guy.
1334896298772852740 2020-12-05 00:24:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL @CityBureaucrat The issues are so much more fundamental now. It's more like dating someone from a different religion. I'm sure if you asked Protestants in 1960, most of them would have had a problem if their child was dating a Catholic and visa versa.

1334893663638450177 2020-12-05 00:13:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Glass half empty, I see.
1334893534512623618 2020-12-05 00:13:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Polish__Patriot @MArepublican18 Well, I'm right about the facts, but that's no guarantee of the final result. The law seems clear: There are more illegal votes than the margin of victory, therefore the election is invalid and cannot be certified if contested.
1334891945026592769 2020-12-05 00:06:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Polish__Patriot @MArepublican18 Republican appointee and the law school (Pacific McGeorge) he went to tends to be more right-leaning than average as well.
1334891413406937088 2020-12-05 00:04:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Here's what they do: They mix in legitimate ballots into the fake ballot mix. That way, in order to throw out the bad ballots, you have to "disenfranchise" the good ballots. This is deviously dishonest and exactly why we have election observation laws.
1334891145705426945 2020-12-05 00:03:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thevivafrei @ScottAdamsSays @Barnes_Law They certainly shouldn't.
1334890875843964929 2020-12-05 00:02:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @lambeth981 Yes, and I never got the jump people make about religion. There are very few people whose story of their wandering from the Faith starts with "and then I realize Santa Claus wasn't real, and, therefore, Jesus too must not be real." Like, what?
1334889775388569602 2020-12-04 23:58:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I noticed my follower count dip yesterday.
1334889577119625217 2020-12-04 23:57:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @lambeth981 I tend to agree, but I don't have children. I think the issue people have, though, is that parents actively participate in it. I just don't think it causes the parental distrust people think it does and the whole thing seems like harmless fun on all sides.
1334885985759408129 2020-12-04 23:43:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Wait, I thought we already had a "hand recount" in Georgia!
1334885665411112968 2020-12-04 23:41:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GodBlessDJT45 @MArepublican18 If the evidence leads him to believe for certain that enough of the fraudulent ballots benefitted Biden, he can. More likely is voiding the election entirely.
1334883903803371520 2020-12-04 23:34:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates Because he's wearing the blue jacket that's supposed to be that of a state official.
1334883364323594250 2020-12-04 23:32:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates They're assuming he's a Republican because he's from the Secretary of State's office, but no one actually knows.
1334883060786008064 2020-12-04 23:31:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates That's what they're saying. Because one state official was there, it's all kosher. Nevermind that they obviously kicked out a bunch of Republicans and there's a 98% Biden 24K vote update coincidental to these events that perfectly matches how many votes would be in the cases.

1334877518806065153 2020-12-04 23:09:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PereGrimmer I think @Barnes_Law is right: You can call most elections (especially with an incumbent) a year out. Of the elections I can remember, it seemed pretty obvious a year out for all of them: 2004-2020. This one was a bit unique with the pandemic, but we all know who really won.
1334871439132987393 2020-12-04 22:45:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Good morning. The election has been DEBOONKED!
1334726124383952901 2020-12-04 13:08:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou If he is convinced of fraud and feels convicted to do the right thing, he will still want to thread a needle so Nevada knows exactly what to do to prevent this from happening again.
1334725772074946561 2020-12-04 13:06:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou That’s the hearing time as far as I know. The longer the hearing tomorrow the more likely I think he is to rule in Trump’s favor. We are making a big claim here and he will be making big precedent if he favors Trump. Both for this election and future Nevada elections.
1334724032038580226 2020-12-04 12:59:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @vpiercy @realDharmapala I think in order to truly understand a religion you should try to understand it from the perspective of someone who actually believes it. Why do they see the world that way? This doesn't entail actually believing that religion.
1334723200454971392 2020-12-04 12:56:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @vpiercy @realDharmapala All I said the standard religion course in the standard secular university feels more like they are studying animals in a zoo than real people who actually live and breathe a religious life. The approach is often bland and a priori skeptical of their experiences.
1334721821535563776 2020-12-04 12:50:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Apparently someone tried to register Raffensperger's dead son in the runoff too. Talk about a kick in the groin. The Abrams gang probably has zero respect for the Kemp-Duncan-Raffensperger crew.
1334719259734368256 2020-12-04 12:40:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ruintal @SelimSeesYou Here's how an election contest like this would go:  Vote-&gt;Count-&gt;Certification-&gt;Recount-&gt;Contest-&gt;State Trial court-&gt;State Appellate System-&gt;State Supreme Court-&gt;SCOTUS-&gt;Senate  Congress rarely resolves disputes like this. They usually respect what the election or courts find.
1334718255047520259 2020-12-04 12:36:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ruintal @SelimSeesYou The Constitution actually makes the Senate the final arbiter of its own elections in case of contest, but state court cases can get to SCOTUS.
1334717743900332032 2020-12-04 12:34:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The traditional remedy in a fraudulent election where you can't be certain who won legitimately is to do a rerun. This seems moot with the runoff coming up anyway. Judges have very rarely decided the fraud was so blatant the other guy should win, though.
1334715573574447105 2020-12-04 12:26:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Is that Mark Sanford in the bottom right? LMAO.
1334715149358346243 2020-12-04 12:24:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy My favorite are the people that claim inerrantists and strong infallibilists are guilty of "Bibliolatry."
1334712535937921029 2020-12-04 12:14:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @vpiercy @realDharmapala What a way to pack a strawman, question begging epithet, and general ignorance into one sentence. Perhaps that is what is taught in English departments now. The fact someone made you a professor of anything is a testament to how failed our academy is.
1334707954944266240 2020-12-04 11:55:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou They were for the Republican.
1334702340662833153 2020-12-04 11:33:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden No, but let me know lol.
1334697701179592705 2020-12-04 11:15:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NewAmer93831160 The fact he didn’t dismiss it out of hand tells me he either has to come up with a really good response to the Trump evidence to wash his hands or he knows what the law is and knows this decision could be momentous.
1334696585494745095 2020-12-04 11:10:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The primary early argument against Trump I heard from Evangelicals was “He is insufficiently pro-life” because they hadn’t yet decided immigration was a moral imperative. Now it seems to be “You’re a wanton idolator and worldly if you think anything important is going on here.”
1334685420022620162 2020-12-04 10:26:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 This is the standard time frame for these kinds of appeals as far as I'm aware.

1334684720597245953 2020-12-04 10:23:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 Basically, it's an arbitrary date Congress setup that if you resolve all dispute before that date your electors are "guaranteed" to count. They aren't. Entire thing is a bit of a sham.
1334684499905568769 2020-12-04 10:22:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @BrianSh86084519 The safe harbor deadline is not final and it actually had been broken at least once: Specifically, Hawaii's 3 electors were switched after the safe harbor in the 1960 election (initially they voted for Nixon by a couple hundred votes, but they ended up for Kennedy).
1334684237207834626 2020-12-04 10:21:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 They could take the case right away. Could still be before the 14th. The December 8th safe harbor isn't the final date people make it out to be, but it would be nice to get something moving before then.

1334645865651318784 2020-12-04 07:49:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jamesdkclark The problem is not being able to separate wisdom from moral imperative. Yes, it is wise to have people of strong moral character on all levels in office, but it is not a moral imperative, and certainly not a very high priority compared to actual moral imperatives.
1334645420828618753 2020-12-04 07:47:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Maybe conservatives angry about the pitch our politics is reaching should consider the background. We have governments locking us up in our homes over a mild seasonal virus and the one guy on the international stage against it is having an election stolen in front of our eyes.
1334642635861057538 2020-12-04 07:36:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There are some Evangelicals who legitimately think saying “I like Trump” is on the verge of heresy.

1334614532648562696 2020-12-04 05:44:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Some patriot who works at security at State Farm Arena likely got access to these tapes and went through them and was like "well, well, what do we have here?"  The Georgia riggers always seemed the most incompetent, inexperienced of the bunch. Was a mistake to even involve them.

1334609318319181827 2020-12-04 05:23:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Apparently the angle is “we don’t know how to interpret these events where there’s a suit case of ballots with no chain of custody. We must spend several days going over this so we can then dismiss your case on the Doctrine of the Laches.”

1334601475184529411 2020-12-04 04:52:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Pray.
1334599432961191945 2020-12-04 04:44:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL Exactly. The narratives, times, and witness testimony line up *perfectly*. This is a rock solid narrative.
1334597850332860416 2020-12-04 04:38:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> With this video, it literally shows you exactly how they would do it in all these states in a very tangible way. There are witnesses to similar events in every state. Why disbelieve them? You can't with any intellectual honesty now.
1334597587601657857 2020-12-04 04:37:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Our narrative has, I believe, won the parsimony test for weeks at this point (perhaps since the moment of the 98% Biden drops), but we're at the point where Ptolemaic epicycles make more sense than "Biden got 81 million legit votes and just enough in the right states to win."
1334596288021745669 2020-12-04 04:32:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BTwanner It was "deboonked" of course:  https://t.co/Em5g3D6OtC
1334596098757971974 2020-12-04 04:31:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The story with Dominion initially seemed overstretched: Stealing votes everywhere, etc. The past week a new narrative has emerged where Dominion and related technologies are systematically aiding Dem strongholds in producing fake ballots and perhaps eat Trump ones.
1334594318435311617 2020-12-04 04:24:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Anyone remember when climatologists across the globe were caught faking temperature readings to peddle climate alarmism and they just doubled down on it anyway?  https://t.co/smsD453JvH
1334591337132412929 2020-12-04 04:12:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> You don’t even have to do the box stuffing the Atlanta people did: Just harvest a bunch of fake nursing home ballots everyone thinks are legitimate on the surface. You could do this in a GOP county.
1334591017094438913 2020-12-04 04:11:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Nursing homes. Check the nursing homes. It really explains why the vote trended the way it did when the electorate was older and Whiter than usual.
1334590327957676032 2020-12-04 04:08:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I wonder if those Fulton ballots were also marked for Ossoff. If they were, Perdue was already re-elected.
1334588297738395649 2020-12-04 04:00:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 @LuisBobby3 Did Bush ram much through beside NCLB? The entire rest of his tenure his mandate was derived from 9/11.
1334587274554712064 2020-12-04 03:56:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realDharmapala I don't get going to a secular university to study religion. Like it's this extremely dry topic in these secular religion departments: Entirely comparative and historical studies. Little consideration of these religions from the perspective of actually believing in something.
1334585940543758346 2020-12-04 03:50:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @CarlStein1984 That would be 270-268. A real tease.

1334584291515375619 2020-12-04 03:44:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jamesdkclark I honestly think a lot of people are taken aback at how broken this is.
1334583996735496192 2020-12-04 03:43:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @revjackashcraft Which is what Rome finally realized, sensibly. Unfortunately for them, the lack of succession rules due to their continued republican virtues led to some unfortunate backstabbing.
1334583683706195969 2020-12-04 03:42:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 Once one breaks, I tend to think at least 4 of the 6 will, possibly all 6.
1334583301621878786 2020-12-04 03:40:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They should assemble anyway.
1334582789367353344 2020-12-04 03:38:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Arizona+Georgia+Wisconsin path is still perfectly viable, as is any path involving Pennsylvania. Nevada remains the sleeper.
1334582165414285317 2020-12-04 03:35:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Damn the Romans were cool. Best Civ and it isn't even close.
1334581656557150209 2020-12-04 03:33:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Roman Office of Dictator once again proves necessary to save republican governments in times of great turmoil.
1334581404265537539 2020-12-04 03:32:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I wonder what "The Editors" think of Trump's "shameful" activity of uncovering mass left-wing election fraud.
1334580990921027590 2020-12-04 03:31:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I wonder why he wouldn't come. Perhaps it is because he knew of a certain video. Criminal.
1334577888495095808 2020-12-04 03:18:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MosleyGang @Pozzidonius1 Waste of time in Georgia. We have them on freaking video lol.
1334576834697195520 2020-12-04 03:14:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> People who are saying Trump shouldn't get another four years are openly advocating rewarding lawless activity and usurpations of power.
1334572836363624454 2020-12-04 02:58:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Our nation will soon be split between a Hispanic Caudillo in the Southwest, two Communist communes in the Northwest and New England into parts of New York, and a Republican Dictatorship in between them.
1334572024367345665 2020-12-04 02:55:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I take my solace in the fact that the correct half of the country now knows everything is a fraud. Our path to victory is now wide open, if not through Trump, then through the collapse of system legitimacy. You cannot have 45+% of your population think it's all a joke.
1334570591500832773 2020-12-04 02:49:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 Yeah, this year made it a lot easier, but there's good, ole-fashioned box stuffing you can do. Identify a low turnout precinct and just have a reserve of ballots to sit in the back and shove in there.
1334570010002513922 2020-12-04 02:47:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm legit wondering how many Democrat ballots are printed any given year. How many of them were there ever? If they just take suit cases full of ballots and shove them through the scanner this year, why wouldn't they do it any year? They always kick out GOP poll watchers.
1334568150306856960 2020-12-04 02:40:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OakenOdyssey @RedEaglePatriot That law still has to go through the House and likely won't before End of Session. It's really nothing, that's why no one bothered to be in town for it.
1334567848191152131 2020-12-04 02:39:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @yernotmydad1776 I mean, what more can you want at this point? Trump is at 248 electors.
1334567596117680131 2020-12-04 02:38:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If we had just courts, this is game, set, match in Georgia.
1334563307248902145 2020-12-04 02:21:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FlycatcherSilky Generally speaking, you might be correct. I tend to favor more local, regional governments as well. However, in disputes within a federal system I think you should generally take the side of the people with the moral high ground.
1334562427195830277 2020-12-04 02:17:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BretagnePoint Those courts take ten days to say "You didn't file soon enough."
1334561804337471492 2020-12-04 02:15:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> My belief here is very simple:  1. It is part of the natural law that the head of state is ultimately responsible to see justice served in his realm.  2. No oath or law of man can legally bind him from doing so.  The conclusion is obvious.
1334560010551128065 2020-12-04 02:07:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @OVonReuenthal There might still be enough in the rest of the complaint that hasn't been dismissed to overturn the results.
1334559600058699782 2020-12-04 02:06:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon There isn't one. The Constitution has been effectively suspended by judicial fiat.
1334559038881796098 2020-12-04 02:04:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 The specific dispute is about poll watchers. We filed those cases during and they just didn't hear them. It's like: What is going on here?
1334558800213405696 2020-12-04 02:03:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> File before election: "Nothing is actionable, hasn't happened yet."   File during the election: Ruling doesn't come quick enough, dispute is moot.  File after the election: "Sorry, too late."  If you support this crap, you're a hypocrite.
1334558375338766346 2020-12-04 02:01:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Let me get this straight: They filed the contest as soon as the ballots were finished getting counted, but it isn't "timely"?   Such obvious corruption.
1334557991228596224 2020-12-04 01:59:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GladstonianLib I guess this makes sense to keep the terms in sync on some level. Still would be fun to have a concurrent UK and US General Election.
1334556383493181452 2020-12-04 01:53:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GladstonianLib The last election was in December 2019, though. Why does the 5 year term not expire in December? A bit confused here.
1334555050329378818 2020-12-04 01:48:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TrustThePlant @RyanGirdusky That bill isn't going to become law and the Senate GOP is much better than it was in 2013.
1334549883789996034 2020-12-04 01:27:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If it can be extended to December, we might have the UK and US election calendar sync up for the first time since 1964.
1334549466616127488 2020-12-04 01:26:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If the Fixed Term Parliament Act is repealed, can the next UK election take place in December 2024, or must it still be May 2024?
1334546957063368706 2020-12-04 01:16:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeracleanVision This is basically the only thing holding the Italian government in place right now. We’d certainly see a new election before 2023 if it weren’t for how much of a bloodbath it would be for the left.
1334546233277476865 2020-12-04 01:13:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The graph for the next Italian General Election is concerning for the right until you realize Lega voters are just shifting to FDI.
1334544888722038792 2020-12-04 01:07:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 GOP governors for 18 straight years, so that makes sense. They are subject to affirmation by the electorate, though.
1334544576183480320 2020-12-04 01:06:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 Georgia Supreme Court?
1334544060414107654 2020-12-04 01:04:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper3 The thing is they never had to struggle for anything. When they came to power in Georgia, they just got swept in on a tide of anti-left sentiment. No careful selection of candidates to win that strategic seat in the state legislature.
1334542784452321283 2020-12-04 00:59:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I imagine the tendency of safe-ish states and seats to produce weak candidates is amplified in a state like Georgia that doesn't have a strong GOP history.
1334539732253077504 2020-12-04 00:47:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Think we discussed the flu shot once: There's been an intense push for it the past few years that is utterly bizarre. Companies are desperate to not lose a single moment of productivity to sickness. You should want healthy employees, but this is overbearing.
1334538944546004993 2020-12-04 00:44:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Never been an anti-vaxxer, but I'm never taking this. Don't care about the consequences.
1334538366822576134 2020-12-04 00:41:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 Ducey is term-limited.
1334538245921796100 2020-12-04 00:41:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you can't rely on witness testimony, written chronicles, etc., then you essentially can't know anything. Light skepticism such that you can be convinced is warranted towards most claims, but radical skepticism is a debilitating epistemology.
1334537664800956420 2020-12-04 00:39:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I avoid radical skepticism towards even some outlandish claims because of what happens in my earlier thread. I only deny things outright if it directly conflicts with Scripture or a necessary dogma of Scripture. You can always find reasons to be skeptical of anything.
1334536999173296129 2020-12-04 00:36:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 Rubio is too popular and Florida is an expensive campaign. Hispanic backlash against a White conservative nominee might push a Democrat over the edge in the state too.
1334536747020062720 2020-12-04 00:35:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @revjackashcraft There are different ideological reasons in this one. For the left, the ideological reason is they believe people hate Trump so much we had the highest election turnout since 1900 to defeat him. Nothing you can do to convince them otherwise.
1334534913119367168 2020-12-04 00:28:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> At some point you have to conclude they don't want to be convinced for one reason or another, likely ideological.
1334534819909431298 2020-12-04 00:27:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Then we get to combining witness testimony to those statistical anomalies and you have a complete narrative of event with multiple witnesses across multiple states: Still isn't enough for these people.
1334534641076887553 2020-12-04 00:27:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Take the evolution of this debate on voter fraud as a prime example. At first we have "no evidence" because, well, we just suspect something. Then we present statistical anomalies. Well, that's weak. Perhaps it is. Then we have witness testimony. Witnesses are unreliable!
1334534209596252161 2020-12-04 00:25:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> At some point you just become a denialist. You can demonstrate the evidence presented is weak in some manner, but claiming it "doesn't exist" is just not true. It's just burying your head in the sand and you have to take more and more radically skeptical approaches to evidence.
1334533794976722946 2020-12-04 00:23:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> People have been borrowing this idea from atheist polemics since the Dawkins days and applying it across the board. Generally a person making an assertion has to provide an argument, but you can't counter their evidence by saying "You need to provide more evidence."
1334531685854089220 2020-12-04 00:15:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 Tim Scott sucks. I don't care if people think we're racist for kicking him out. The man hates his own voters.
1334530667967893508 2020-12-04 00:11:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I forgot Pennsylvania. Maybe we can get @SenMastriano to run there?
1334530521314054147 2020-12-04 00:10:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 The new instant runoff system in Alaska is likely to favor her, though, unfortunately.
1334529887051329538 2020-12-04 00:08:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These are top targets, but probably should have added North Carolina here. New Hampshire and Alaska could also be in the mix here, but I just think these are lower on the list.
1334529411660525571 2020-12-04 00:06:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Pirate_HuntZoro Tillis isn't up in 2022. Richard Burr announced retirement.

1334528720837742592 2020-12-04 00:03:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Pirate_HuntZoro Oh, that one should be a target too. Lots of rumors Lara Trump will go for it: She's probably a lock for the GOP nod if she does.
1334528521256005639 2020-12-04 00:02:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Mark Kelly is up again in 2022. The election this year was a special election, which is why he has already taken his seat.

1334527084207747074 2020-12-03 23:57:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @hoomysoup There are, unfortunately, some personally popular figures who have threaded the needle the past 4 years. However, yes, 2022-2024 is likely to be a bloodbath for establishment cons. They're already getting rarer and rarer. A lot of them don't even face primary voters and retire.
1334525514657226753 2020-12-03 23:50:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It still gets me that NeverTrump conservatives main case is "Yeah, we basically were never conservative and were lying to you the whole time. But you should accept it because we're the Real Republicans."

1334363996472930304 2020-12-03 13:09:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @AnglicanMan19 The GOP Establishment in Georgia doesn’t seem to care about either. They seem willing to throw them overboard if it means getting rid of Trump.
1334363651596234753 2020-12-03 13:07:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Ugh...it’s going to be ugly if this whole fraud thing isn’t sorted out.
1334356159449337856 2020-12-03 12:37:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried Dude has me blocked and I don’t even know why other than suggesting caution giving any money/info to their website.
1334355819748614144 2020-12-03 12:36:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 They seem like a sideshow at this point. Maybe their stuff pans out later, but it’s clearly not the focus.
1334353966071762949 2020-12-03 12:29:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidSh00289562 No, I don't unfortunately.
1334353689927159808 2020-12-03 12:28:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If SCOTUS takes the case and throws at Pennsylvania, it's literally a whole new ball game. Dams breaking everywhere. Also, looking forward to the Nevada hearing tomorrow.
1334353029957562368 2020-12-03 12:25:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @T51BC Not sure. Would depend on where the population distribution is.
1334352259732353025 2020-12-03 12:22:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles The recount would have been an obvious sham.
1334352070158249984 2020-12-03 12:21:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 Yeah, but the sham recount in Georgia made it look like even more of a sham than it was.
1334351946967371776 2020-12-03 12:21:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates I love you too, bro.
1334351731950546944 2020-12-03 12:20:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 Yeah, he still doesn't make it out of the Senate primary.
1334351544234500102 2020-12-03 12:19:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I do actually think the campaign made a strategic mistake not going for the recount in Michigan.
1334351206525898755 2020-12-03 12:18:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 Maybe he has Senate ambitions in 2022 or something.
1334350511970070528 2020-12-03 12:15:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So, top target in the House is this guy in 2022:
1334349569094791168 2020-12-03 12:11:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAJMHoward @quindle @ScottMGreer This is very explicitly outlawed in the canons of my Anglican Church.
1334349472969744386 2020-12-03 12:11:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAJMHoward @quindle @ScottMGreer All Anglicans ordain women? This is news to them.
1334348874006355968 2020-12-03 12:08:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAJMHoward @quindle @ScottMGreer You're so ignorant of different Anglican Churchmanship this is laughable. You've spent 27 years in Catholic Apologetics and apparently haven't learned enough to not make a fool of yourself in an internet exchange by equating Baptists with Russian Orthodox and Anglo-Catholics.
1334347491383386113 2020-12-03 12:03:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAJMHoward @quindle @ScottMGreer Those guys wouldn't associate themselves with Evangelicals.
1334347364597981189 2020-12-03 12:02:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @quindle @DavidAJMHoward @ScottMGreer He's very typical of the sort of Neo-Evangelical who has absolute no attachment to any historical tradition. Gets sort of angsty about this lack of rootedness and then just digs the aesthetics of Rome or Constantinople. Doesn't really adopt the new tradition fully, though.
1334345932264124416 2020-12-03 11:57:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAJMHoward @quindle @ScottMGreer If you can walk into these two Churches and tell me they are similar, I think your understanding of theology is lacking. Of course, you strike me as the type of guy who'd say they're closer to Islam too or something.  https://t.co/FUX8rkVDyz
1334344837856972803 2020-12-03 11:52:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Would.
1334344408326664193 2020-12-03 11:51:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realDharmapala This guy wrote a whole book about how we have to retreat from the culture and all he does is push his opinions....in the culture.
1334344120987492352 2020-12-03 11:50:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There are people out there who think it's some kind of moral obligation to listen to every random public intellectual to get a "balanced" view of public life. Who has that kind of time.
1334343707328454657 2020-12-03 11:48:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realDharmapala I don't know, I don't make a habit of caring about his opinions. Some guy at Church was telling me about it the Sunday before Thanksgiving, though.
1334343079843819521 2020-12-03 11:45:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidSh00289562 No one really knows, but he can try.
1334342991960477698 2020-12-03 11:45:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAJMHoward @quindle @ScottMGreer I'm just not seeing it.
1334342750255403009 2020-12-03 11:44:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidSh00289562 Yes, they'd send two slates.
1334342671331188736 2020-12-03 11:44:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ClassicalTheis The trouble is being the first domino. Legislators likely aren't going to be it. Win a big court case, then activate a legislator, then it falls into place.
1334342343017852929 2020-12-03 11:43:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @quindle @ScottMGreer @DavidAJMHoward Hey, he's Eastern Orthodox now. They can have him and Frankie Schaeffer.
1334341858949033985 2020-12-03 11:41:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Michigan Legislature likely will not break the dam, but they could deliver their electors if one of the court cases goes our way.
1334341101004713989 2020-12-03 11:38:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realDharmapala His opinion is that it would cause too much strife for Trump to win now. Nevermind that all that would do is short-circuit the success of his "Benedict Option."
1334340676515999744 2020-12-03 11:36:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer "Theodosius is being too mean to the pagans! We must distance ourselves from his heinous crimes."  "You servile beast, the Vestal Virgins needed to be purged as their continued devotion to the false gods of our pagan past are a curse upon the empire."  "Why are you so mean?"
1334339657878876161 2020-12-03 11:32:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer I wonder if there were editorials like this from theologians published about various Roman Emperors after Constantine.
1334338705633538048 2020-12-03 11:28:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @hoomysoup 10% of the Democrat votes in a Democrat machine country are just fake or otherwise coerced. That's being conservative.
1334337948800737284 2020-12-03 11:25:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidSh00289562 Oh, and Ed Gillespie should have been the incumbent Senator this year.
1334337556436168705 2020-12-03 11:23:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidSh00289562 Virginia probably voted for Romney in 2012 and maybe Trump 2016.
1334337128059301888 2020-12-03 11:22:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidSh00289562 Oh, Fairfax is corrupt too.
1334337063731277825 2020-12-03 11:22:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 The state is only 10% rural.
1334336291253661696 2020-12-03 11:18:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 That would be surprising.
1334335747755794433 2020-12-03 11:16:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Would it surprise anyone if Democrats print 100K votes in Detroit every election?
1334334798630936576 2020-12-03 11:13:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I wonder what the 2008 campaign would have been like if the GOP nominated Rudy. Could have been a lot more fun. Too bad he was pro-choice and a terrible campaigner.
1334334314373394432 2020-12-03 11:11:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NerdGhey That the people are pissed off and the Founding Fathers wouldn't stand for it.
1334334183121022978 2020-12-03 11:10:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing The left.
1334334026707034112 2020-12-03 11:09:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Democrat: Let me nitpick some random statement you made.
1334333279181344768 2020-12-03 11:06:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The day the moderate liberal New York Republican began to hate.
1334332568339156998 2020-12-03 11:04:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Giuliani sounds like he’s on the warpath.
1334331264531357701 2020-12-03 10:58:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If we don't see the Rubicon crossed now, might want to get elected to a legislature in the near future to participate in the brawls that will likely erupt periodically over the next several years.
1334329805312024577 2020-12-03 10:53:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal Literally all the left has is snark and, unfortunately for them, it got old very quickly after W left office.
1334328833672159232 2020-12-03 10:49:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FestiveJones @JayFiveK It’s an automatic process, which is legal.
1334320552253812741 2020-12-03 10:16:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 I know. We’re at the point it’s comical.
1334320351174651904 2020-12-03 10:15:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK It seems like a necessary consequence of the electors clause. The state legislature can’t be prevented from doing its job by some tricks of the state executive or judiciary.
1334274676412084231 2020-12-03 07:14:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PereGrimmer @JayFiveK @The_WGD Yeah, Somalis don't even natively speak Arabic. If a Somali knows their Arabic well enough to speak conversationally, they know English lol.
1334268754612645888 2020-12-03 06:50:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK He will let the constitutional process play out and cross if he needs to. Just as Caesar did: He will let the Senate make the right decision before alea iacta est.
1334264287460782080 2020-12-03 06:32:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This whole thread is a joke, though. "Reports" lol.
1334263962670657539 2020-12-03 06:31:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Small victories build into bigger victories.
1334262754069389313 2020-12-03 06:26:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 Nothing, my point is rhetorical.
1334261359257726977 2020-12-03 06:21:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I mean, he's President, if he tells you Q is real, it probably is.
1334260953953816583 2020-12-03 06:19:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JorgvonWartburg @DaldorenGaming Yeah, people do this. I was thinking of voting for Bernie back in the March primary. Couldn't bring myself to do it as my state has a loyalty pledge (not that it's enforceable).
1334260024064012290 2020-12-03 06:15:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DaldorenGaming No one has independently confirmed it either. It's public record, but it's not like you can just look it up on the website.
1334259194527162369 2020-12-03 06:12:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DaldorenGaming To be fair, this is public record.
1334256155133157378 2020-12-03 06:00:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @floydgroyper @RedEaglePatriot @based_pal He won't be able to block it if he's not majority leader.
1334256068055212032 2020-12-03 06:00:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @based_pal Perdue and Loeffler will not be among them.
1334255891575660553 2020-12-03 05:59:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Since Covid is going to be a seasonal virus, I can easily see most of the people who die this winter having had covid. They will say Covid is killing tens, maybe hundreds of thousands when the overall death rate has barely budged from the year before.
1334254789585199106 2020-12-03 05:55:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar I never got my money from the 2016 election because the ones that allow Americans are even scummier with more bizarre business practices.
1334251436209827847 2020-12-03 05:41:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidSh00289562 Yes, but the State Legislature has minimal interest in the Senate contests, if any. Some of them might be eyeing those seats themselves.
1334250640382578689 2020-12-03 05:38:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidSh00289562 There is no leverage there. Loeffler and Perdue have called on the issues to be addressed in public, multiple times. There's literally nothing else they can do.
1334249998448553985 2020-12-03 05:36:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I hate ritual denunciations. Except the way Trump does it:  Reporter: "Will you denounce this evil racist!?!?"  Trump: "I denounce them."  Reporter: "Do it harder!"  Trump: "Shut up, I already did."
1334249720466837508 2020-12-03 05:34:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johncardillo @news_revolver @realDonaldTrump Trump is rallying for Leoffler and Perdue on Saturday. What more do you want?
1334248927894392833 2020-12-03 05:31:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 Eh, I'd prefer a virtuous man, but politics, especially for an aggressive reformer, tends to be for the hot-blooded. Just comes with the territory.
1334248108117651463 2020-12-03 05:28:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> My mother once told me Presidents couldn't have wives that were too attractive because it makes other men jealous and women can't relate to the First Lady. I think there's some truth in this and why a lot of Trump criticism has always boiled down to sex.
1334247043401998338 2020-12-03 05:24:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon I feel like he is setting it up. Let a state flip through court order and then go Rubicon if the legal options are denied by other means.
1334246300863303681 2020-12-03 05:21:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Where there's a will, there's a way.
1334245233182314512 2020-12-03 05:17:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton The Governor of Michigan in particular: She's a real piece of work.
1334243525693739010 2020-12-03 05:10:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They didn’t when Mitt Romney was in control lol.
1334243192825376771 2020-12-03 05:09:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 @RedEaglePatriot They only need 50 if the filibuster is broken, which they might do. Also Perdue and Loeffler are pretty solid “nays” to get to 41 to filibuster.
1334242567714693120 2020-12-03 05:06:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m down for President Flynn, tbh.
1334237972921716738 2020-12-03 04:48:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Thamer72663870 @Barnes_Law Perdue was 12K short of a majority in the general election itself. To say there's "zero chance" is just ridiculous.
1334236397994184704 2020-12-03 04:42:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'd vote in the Georgia runoffs, but the most cringeworthy people in this whole affair are the folks who want you to not criticize Perdue and Loeffler when they were gutter sniping at Trump before the highest turnout, highest stakes election of our lifetime so far.
1334235155905581058 2020-12-03 04:37:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GladstonianLib At least make them cheat instead of just giving it to them. Perdue is an immigration hawk and Loeffler is literally just a generic R vote.
1334234350716653570 2020-12-03 04:33:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cummymonke @SelimSeesYou This is bigger than the Tea Party. Trump probably has like 60 million loyalists at least.
1334230007279972354 2020-12-03 04:16:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Literally the only place we've had any real discovery process and we find 2% of the votes were stolen from Trump. People denying election fraud are burying their heads deeper and deeper.  https://t.co/aJkjLz1nqr

1334228288974295040 2020-12-03 04:09:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @radiationorgan Ali sucks, but Caesar had to placate the plebs too.
1334224651401224192 2020-12-03 03:55:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 That's besides the point. They have infighting, but they are just better at presenting a united front in the middle of battle.
1334223381462458370 2020-12-03 03:50:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is why Democrats win a lot of optics battles: They wait until after the election to criticize losing narratives unless they have no choice. We all sit around in a circular firing squad making sure every i is dotted in every Trump press conference.
1334219360425144330 2020-12-03 03:34:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 Yeah, the Karens dominate California politics, unfortunately.
1334219063174848512 2020-12-03 03:33:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cummymonke @SelimSeesYou Based.
1334218778012508162 2020-12-03 03:31:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Pennsylvania's GOP is going to the SCOTUS, though. I think their guy is just bad at social media lol. Doesn't post much at all.
1334218537536196613 2020-12-03 03:31:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 What I think is liable to happen there is a GOP bounceback in terms of state government in 2022, this goes well, and leads to a state realignment.
1334217524372787202 2020-12-03 03:27:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 There’s effectively no rural vote in California. It’s like 10% of the vote when nationally it’s like 30.
1334217338497998850 2020-12-03 03:26:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 Problem in California is that the White population there is disproportionately the type of White pop that doesn’t like Trumpism: Educated, suburban, not particularly religious.
1334216274184900608 2020-12-03 03:22:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ElectionPage Trump needs to run nonstop for the next four years if this happens. Leader of the Opposition style.
1334215787658276866 2020-12-03 03:20:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BayouSzarvas This was a long time coming. It isn’t Trump they have a problem with (though, they may use that as an excuse). It’s his policies they actually object to. They directly conflict with their interests.
1334215360200007683 2020-12-03 03:18:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 3 million new voters with that same split for ten years is too far out to rely on. I agree ten years is the horizon here, though. Also if we get a dynamic where more settled voters gradually become more Republican, the numbers keep growing for Democrats to flip the state.
1334213947189293056 2020-12-03 03:12:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ElectionPage That’s one reason I’m not convinced of the “we will never win again!” narrative if the worst happens. Just need to evade amnesty for four years and 2024 could be a Democrat bloodbath.
1334213625905602562 2020-12-03 03:11:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 Trump won by 631K votes. Assuming a 70-30 Dem split (not the case), Dems would need to get 1.5 million new voters in Texas to narrowly win the state. Assuming a more reasonable 60-40 split, it’s north of 3 million new voters.
1334212563769364480 2020-12-03 03:07:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> That said, I'm of the opinion the GOP has more room to grow in terms of genuine vote switchers. Democrats just always get better media. GOP gets voters by breaking them out of the media echo chamber.
1334212200265904128 2020-12-03 03:05:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is why Texas seems like fool's gold for Democrats for the time being as well. They need to convince people who voted for Trump to win the state anytime soon. Does anyone foresee that happening? Seems unlikely to me.
1334211693098962946 2020-12-03 03:03:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> California 2020 is a good example of why raw vote is more important than margin in terms of the swingability of a state. Trump shrunk his percentage margin there, but lost by a million more votes. To win a state like that, you need real vote switches and not just turnout juice.
1334208993330421760 2020-12-03 02:53:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Full repeal actually would leave places like 4chan vulnerable to lawsuits.
1334208895494090753 2020-12-03 02:52:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm personally of the opinion that Section 230 needs to be amended to include the provision that it applies, but only if all legal speech (besides pornography) is allowed on the forum uncensored.
1334208506904399875 2020-12-03 02:51:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 I'd almost bet on Wisconsin. Arizona is looking really good too. Nevada has a hearing tomorrow too. SCOTUS will likely give us Pennsylvania if any other state breaks too.
1334207723274203138 2020-12-03 02:48:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @JayFiveK We have all the time we need.
1334207565807439872 2020-12-03 02:47:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All we need is one state to break, guys. One state. If one state breaks, this whole narrative is destroyed. Even if we get some crazy crap where the electors get pushed through anyway, our cause will be fully justified among a critical mass of people.
1334207042379264000 2020-12-03 02:45:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @JayFiveK I mean, she's just stating facts, we all know this. Things are coming together, though. NV+AZ+PA denies Biden 270. NV+AZ+WI+GA also denies Biden 270. I think if one of these breaks, the others will fall fast.
1334205284173156360 2020-12-03 02:38:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MosleyGang @realDharmapala Tomorrow is the hearing in Nevada too: They're saying they're going to present evidence of massive fraud in Clark County, Nevada. Tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of votes. Dam seems ready to break in the Southwest.
1334204691518005255 2020-12-03 02:36:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MosleyGang @realDharmapala This is part of a formal elections contest in Arizona. The full hearing is on Monday. We haven't even gotten to the good stuff here.
1334204354941886464 2020-12-03 02:34:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK The hearing is on Monday and we still haven't gotten to signature matching. This error here wasn't even possible to find in any publicly available data.
1334204098606997508 2020-12-03 02:33:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> You can get away with being a financial center if you're a small island nation or European microstate, but just expect extended hard times whenever the economy hits a speed bump.
1334203626785562624 2020-12-03 02:31:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The foundation of any strong, resilient economy is goods production. I know people "studying" economics who don't get this.
1334202881935880193 2020-12-03 02:28:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal I disagree it’s hopeless if this doesn’t get fixed, but this needs to be fought out to the greatest extent possible to have a shot at 2024 even if it doesn’t work out.
1334202559268007937 2020-12-03 02:27:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @EyeballFlaming I’ve never lived in New York or a metro center personally. You just have a higher density of interesting characters in these places and weirdos running around at all hours of the night.

1334191297037471744 2020-12-03 01:42:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The only good thing about living in a place like New York is eating at a 24 hour diner after 1 AM and people watching.
1334180576916615168 2020-12-03 01:00:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 12 vote lead. Very robust compared to Miller-Meeks’ 6 vote lead in Iowa 2 lol.

1334173188671016965 2020-12-03 00:30:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NewAmer93831160 I keep getting a lot of messages and replies asking me to reassure them on the prospects and it’s not like I have access to some inside info.
1334172794729410561 2020-12-03 00:29:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Thought the hearing was tomorrow, but hopefully this one out.
1334172068338872323 2020-12-03 00:26:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics And now you understand why the Voting Rights Act and a lot of civil rights jurisprudence is just a license for Democrats to get away with mass electoral fraud.
1334170723406016528 2020-12-03 00:21:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm just going to say this: I'm not your election support blanket.
1334170598373793800 2020-12-03 00:20:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidSh00289562 Yes.
1334170462402777089 2020-12-03 00:20:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton @AZGOP @kelliwardaz @realDonaldTrump Not all ballots were duplicated, though. However, considering these are switches, they could for 2 in terms in terms of margin. So switching 2 from Biden to Trump means you're 4 votes closer.
1334169856535646208 2020-12-03 00:17:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Thamer72663870 @DavidSh00289562 Ask her.
1334169768132308994 2020-12-03 00:17:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidSh00289562 Will be up to the court.
1334169200974245892 2020-12-03 00:14:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidSh00289562 I don't know how many duplicates there are, but if they're switching 4% of Trump's votes to Biden in duplicates, it would only take like 150-200K duplicates to overturn the state.
1334168808899153922 2020-12-03 00:13:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If they're removing about 4% of Trump's votes (assuming 50/50 Biden/Trump), then what else are they doing?
1334168101823401984 2020-12-03 00:10:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 2% is a big number in a state separated by 11K votes.
1333973063839395840 2020-12-02 11:15:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon Optics is for guerrilla warfare. We’re at the stage of guerrilla warfare where our forces are strong enough to confront the enemy head on in a conventional battle.
1333971460176683009 2020-12-02 11:09:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ClassicalTheis I honestly didn’t expect we’d actually get this far. Trump could unironically make himself Emperor right now and get away with it.
1333948276568158214 2020-12-02 09:37:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @quantuspolling @JayFiveK Anything remotely competitive, obviously. Then OR+WA+NJ+IL would do it or throw NY into the mix. Would require even extremely depressed turnout in several major metros, though.
1333946567796154368 2020-12-02 09:30:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @quantuspolling Yeah, if Trump is at 75 million with Covid, easily could have hit 80-85 without it with a completely disinterested Democrat Party.

1333826172472487939 2020-12-02 01:31:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Wisconsin and Nevada appear to have the strongest factual claims to me. The Pennsylvania case is the strongest on the legal front. The margins in Arizona and Georgia are very narrow. Michigan the hardest, but we do have some pretty crazy evidence there.

1333272421835673601 2020-11-30 12:51:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf This goes back to my disagreement with classical liberalism itself: Problem is that written constitutions can only ever be a small part of a constitutional order. As important are all the forms and manners of government: The unwritten rules.
1333271070477049857 2020-11-30 12:46:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ElectionPage Even then I think it’s so broken the Republicans would have to call a new Constitutional Convention and pass something rapidly. Probably a whole new Constitution.
1333270780885536768 2020-11-30 12:44:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> At some point you just have to recognize the institutions incidental to the Constitution are so thoroughly corrupt and unaccountable the only means of fixing them is radical constitutional reform, which the Constitution makes prohibitively difficult when the stakes are high.
1333270162930360321 2020-11-30 12:42:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> My main concern with a 2024 run is I’ve believed the American Constitution is fundamentally broken at this point for a long time. We’ve kept the forms without the substance for a long time. Now we’re rapidly losing the forms. These aren’t things that just get fixed through will.

The constant rush to throw out the evidence of any potential fraud should be convincing enough for anyone of sound mind to recognize what’s going on.

1333250514969108480 2020-11-30 11:24:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ancap_oracle @ScottMGreer Man is an unknown quantity.
1333249332158603264 2020-11-30 11:19:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer I’m convinced Kemp and Raffensperger want to screw Perdue too.
1333246898585690112 2020-11-30 11:10:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I think Barnes is full of himself, but he's right on the facts here very likely and on the likely path forward. I really think Plan B is justified, but Plan C is viable.
1333243198106464256 2020-11-30 10:55:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou 6 Dem defections is not that many really for key pieces of legislation regardless of how the contestation works out.
1333240355530166274 2020-11-30 10:44:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 @SelimSeesYou But they don't stand for anything and are clearly unwilling to fight for a seat at the table. It was remarkably easy to get Paul Ryan to leave office. Now he thinks he can manipulate things like some weasel on the FNC board, but we see how that turned out.
1333239909709213696 2020-11-30 10:42:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you lack either the courage of your conviction or raw will to power, please stay out of active political life. You're only hurting your own side.
1333239350423932932 2020-11-30 10:40:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou These are people who I honestly don't believe ever had the courage of their conviction or even raw will to power. I don't even know why they're in politics. Maybe there was a time where Congress could be a form of community service, but that time has long since passed.
1333237813333159937 2020-11-30 10:33:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Chars_Slonker @BronzeCullis Then there's the Kurds....
1333237638401306624 2020-11-30 10:33:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Tells you a lot about the subcontinent.
1333236967887220738 2020-11-30 10:30:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The party is healing. It's one reason I think talks of third parties are dumb. New people like Paul Mitchell are getting harder and harder to come by. The only one I can think of this cycle is the guy in TX-23.
1333233885770108928 2020-11-30 10:18:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I've never heard of a black-pilled man seizing power or even getting very far. Usually they're gay writers if you've ever even heard of them.
1333233357812064257 2020-11-30 10:16:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ancap_oracle There's a rock in a park in Arlington we drop Plan B docs under, but we're not supposed to talk about it.
1333231101494562816 2020-11-30 10:07:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DaldorenGaming Yes, totally not that. I'm a man of peace.

1333230278261747713 2020-11-30 10:04:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I wonder why people think Top Secret Plan B should be on the table.
1333217315299717120 2020-11-30 09:12:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperRedacted @HHHtappedin Eh, all these "dissident right" fakes seem to be reflexive bootlickers.
1333217148634865666 2020-11-30 09:11:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HHHtappedin They support lockdowns? Geez. What freaking losers. "Dissident" my ass.

1333214368851505152 2020-11-30 09:00:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ancap_oracle @thevivafrei @Barnes_Law Yeah, he's one of those "my way or the highway" kind of guys, but his opinions on various legal doctrines being used are astute.
1333213934841712647 2020-11-30 08:59:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LibertyHangout @Filmerian1 That's no an abuse of authority because it's the right thing to do.

1333213174858969088 2020-11-30 08:56:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Listening to the @thevivafrei and @Barnes_Law stream. Infuriating the way these courts handle elections.
1333200089079296002 2020-11-30 08:04:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Don't really want to start a blog tonight. Anyone have an anon file sharing site they'd recommend?
1333199642289446913 2020-11-30 08:02:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon Yes. A Speaker can be overridden by a discharge petition. There is no such thing in the Senate: The Majority Leader can prevent anything he doesn't like from making it to the floor.

1333196098819813377 2020-11-30 07:48:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @Barnes_Law It’s not tenable to have a society where 43% of the population thinks the government is illegitimate.
1333193506333093889 2020-11-30 07:37:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law This same poll underestimated Trump by 4 points even according to the fraud numbers.

1333179263885975554 2020-11-30 06:41:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @OVonReuenthal @HeritageNLegacy By House delegation each gets one vote. The good thing is that Don Young and Liz Cheney are bookends (besides Alabama), so we will know very early what’s going down on any particular ballot.
1333178003099160578 2020-11-30 06:36:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ancap_oracle @JohnDoe22628416 @punisheddixie @RichardBSpencer And Charlottesville was always going to be bad optics. If they had just shut their mouths they could have played games behind the scenes.
1333177476961464320 2020-11-30 06:34:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So, is the SCOTUS a bunch of GOP partisan hacks willing to do anything to help us, or is it brave and impartial? Depends on what helps the narrative today.
1333176965101215744 2020-11-30 06:32:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal @HeritageNLegacy Liz Cheney, yes. Don Young? I doubt it.   Also, that wouldn’t give Dems a majority. Would be 25-23 if Iowa goes our way. 24-23 if it doesn’t. Would be a lot of ballots.
1333175923999453184 2020-11-30 06:28:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ancap_oracle @JohnDoe22628416 @punisheddixie @RichardBSpencer I tend to think Spencer is some kind of asset given his particular background. Asset of who? I don’t know, I just watch things.
1333173667950374915 2020-11-30 06:19:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 @0komi By executive order when every court in the land is conspiring to frustrate your will. These people are delusional.
1333173475884855301 2020-11-30 06:18:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 Man won more seats than were available.
1333173191133507586 2020-11-30 06:17:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @0komi You are just lying at this point.
1333172988330594307 2020-11-30 06:16:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @0komi @RamblingGroyper The ones that made your paycheck fatter? Yes. Did you know there was actually a wealth transfer from big cities to the country from that tax reform bill? But cringenats have now embraced stale, decades old Dem talking points on taxes these days lol.
1333172585421475840 2020-11-30 06:14:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis I don’t even believe this, but I’d propose.
1333172128812830720 2020-11-30 06:12:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @0komi This is like complaining someone is a bad negotiator because they couldn’t walk off the lot with a new Ferrari for 5 grand.
1333171586589921281 2020-11-30 06:10:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @0komi Yes, Trump made a mistake allowing Paul Ryan to survive for a House term. That’s obvious, but you can always find something someone did wrong.
1333171257328721922 2020-11-30 06:09:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @0komi 52-48, then 51-49 one of whom is John McCain and the likes of Bob Corker hanging around. You cringenats are so ridiculously ignorant of the political process it’s ridiculous.
1333169966942662656 2020-11-30 06:04:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @0komi @punisheddixie His executive order wasn’t even relevant until he signed it. There were no critical race theory classes in the FedGov or contractors before this past summer. Source: Me. I work here.
1333169179298566148 2020-11-30 06:01:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Imagine thinking a democracy is legit when they won’t even let you investigate it.
1333168879984668672 2020-11-30 06:00:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LikeStojakovic Yeah, votes for dead people don’t count. Actually, he has to make it to the 6th of January.
1333168563494981636 2020-11-30 05:58:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @0komi @punisheddixie 400 miles of wall is progress. You reject progress. You make the perfect the enemy of the good. You are an unreasonable person.
1333168086749491201 2020-11-30 05:56:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If Biden doesn’t make it to the 14th, Trump might end up President by default. Or we get the Harris/Pence Admin.
1333167480106340358 2020-11-30 05:54:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @0komi @punisheddixie Trump never promised to end immigration and that has to go through Congress dumbass. Also, illegal immigration is, by nature, impossible to stop 100%. DACA is subject to dumb court games.
1333167207162015745 2020-11-30 05:53:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Black-pillers always cover their demoralization as being “realistic.” They’re literally as unrealistic as any starry-eyed optimist. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, and you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.
1333165876070277120 2020-11-30 05:48:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @0komi @punisheddixie What else do you want?
1333165624013500417 2020-11-30 05:47:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tempustempus I’m posting the backup plans for the blackpilled apocalyticists on this.
1333165148303990792 2020-11-30 05:45:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @punisheddixie Will is a literal three letter asset lol.
1333164724595421184 2020-11-30 05:43:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @0komi @punisheddixie Cut legal immigration by half and constructed 400 miles of border wall.
1333164296927408132 2020-11-30 05:41:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BretagnePoint Looks like they reversed on the most bizarre basis ever.

1333163425829179392 2020-11-30 05:38:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BretagnePoint The L. Lin Wood case?
1333157661437812738 2020-11-30 05:15:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I didn’t expect the Harris Admin-Elect to start so soon and yet be so short.
1333156226616713218 2020-11-30 05:09:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 @JayFiveK They are obsessed with getting right wing people to read their trash and take it seriously. Meanwhile, they trash any conservative outlet.
1333155791742922753 2020-11-30 05:08:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 @SelbJim Even if you take the results at face value, 80/220 million eligible isn’t a majority by a long shot.
1333154141699526659 2020-11-30 05:01:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I’ve actually heard this for years even before Trump is a thing. That conservatives basically live in a bubble. Meanwhile lefties can’t even tell you what right wing people (of any stripe) actually believe.
1333134741369982976 2020-11-30 03:44:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton The most frustrating aspect of this is the dooming. Not to be all “trust the plan,” but like there’s nothing we can do but show up at rallies and tweet anyway.
1333131221501681665 2020-11-30 03:30:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton He was on Maria Bartiromo and he expressed uncertainty about whether SCOTUS would provide relief.
1333121334755389448 2020-11-30 02:51:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 They file a challenge after Dane is finished.
1333120833036881922 2020-11-30 02:49:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 The point of the recount wasn’t to find Trump votes, it was to identify the fraudulent ballots.
1333120497933017092 2020-11-30 02:47:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Yes, and they found hundreds of thousands of challengeable ballots.
1333120013901979650 2020-11-30 02:45:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 It was an uphill battle for Caesar (quite literally) until the Battle of Pharsalus.
1333106235231645697 2020-11-30 01:51:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So Trump questioned whether SCOTUS would provide relief and everyone is panicking? Caesarian Legions facing 2:1 odds against the Pompeians we are not.
1333104556465676302 2020-11-30 01:44:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is where centuries of democracy worship leaves you: Totally unable to even have a democracy because everyone in authority is too afraid to question the legitimacy of the results.
1333097598710915075 2020-11-30 01:16:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheFatManDiary @OVonReuenthal Our argument isn’t with split ticketing, but the unusually high drop off between races in terms of raw votes. These people didn’t vote Biden-Perdue-Loeffler. They voted Biden-only.
1333097307114524676 2020-11-30 01:15:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal The problem is this isn’t what we are even saying. The problem is these votes don’t exist at all down ballot, not that they voted for Biden and then Republican down ballot. A genuine case of that is Nebraska-2.
1333093094020018176 2020-11-30 00:58:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingOfSalt4 @AnimeBibleVerse This is true while also laughing at modern science cultists.
1333091044913778688 2020-11-30 00:50:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal These people always pull out these “threats” as a means of accessing political capital from gullible normies. Meanwhile Rand Paul has actually been physically accosted and even shot at. Steve Scalise was literally shot. How many death threats has Trump received from celebs now?
1333085694957383692 2020-11-30 00:29:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RoyalistW The problem with population decline is that it can spiral into a negative feedback loop as the society ages on the whole. Family formation and rebound becomes more difficult. I suspect there is a bottom to this, but we’ve never really experienced this type of population decline.
1333082752502140933 2020-11-30 00:17:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is complete. Debating where to post it.
1333082037562073089 2020-11-30 00:14:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheEorlkonig Would have been worth it for entertainment value alone.
1333081200135639040 2020-11-30 00:11:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump likely voted for Laura Loomer in the General Election lol.
1333056945532661762 2020-11-29 22:35:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 They probably are ignorant of them.
1333056559589584896 2020-11-29 22:33:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mu11igan @MeldEndCastles @augustin_brown @goldiesway Imagine thinking that just because you confess Christ, murder is of the same moral weight as, say, pilfering a bag of chocolates.
1333033935513808896 2020-11-29 21:03:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar No doubt they targeted Flynn very early. Particularly because Flynn was against the Russia hawks.
1333018134941491200 2020-11-29 20:01:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Apparently they did in 2009-10 with control over AL, AR, and LA legislatures, but those Democrats likely voted Republican up ticket themselves personally.
1333015770557796352 2020-11-29 19:51:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 This is actually why the Framers set it up that way.
1333013207083053056 2020-11-29 19:41:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 This is also highly unlikely to happen considering Democrats haven’t controlled that many state legislatures in decades.
1333010999868272644 2020-11-29 19:32:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar Plans do fail. Just because a plan doesn’t work doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist nor does it mean it is a bad plan.
1333010489002127364 2020-11-29 19:30:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NRxAuthors @KingofShirgar You can argue that was the plan, but they didn’t expect the courts to be absolutely unwilling to hear evidence. No plan survives first contact with the enemy.
1333004071960272896 2020-11-29 19:05:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar This is where I think trusting Trump is perfectly normal: He has proven he has the right instincts on multiple occasions. I trust his instincts and his generals goals. I don’t necessarily buy that there is “a plan” in the Q sense (even if it isn’t Q), but I trust the decision.
1333002895327948800 2020-11-29 19:00:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar Ideological autists are the drivers of any “true belief.” This is correct. Also, even the smartest person can start with a faulty premise and end up on a rabbit trail.
1333002328966897665 2020-11-29 18:58:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @doukhobour @KingofShirgar Also, those people are ideological autists, not emotionalists.
1333002124293251081 2020-11-29 18:57:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @doukhobour @KingofShirgar This isn’t most people.
1333001275827490816 2020-11-29 18:54:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @doukhobour @KingofShirgar This is simply wrong. Even people who believe things for no other reason than raw emotion have breaking points where their emotions can handle the narrative swings.

1332998210781122560 2020-11-29 18:41:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar Donald Trump has an unusually high degree of loyalty for a modern Western politician, but this a return to the mean historically.
1332997865610866688 2020-11-29 18:40:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar Yeah, eventually a narrative collapses like this. We should distinguish two types of “trust the plan” people, though:  1. Q-types with a very specific idea of what “the plan” is. 2. Those who trust Donald Trump to make the right decision.  The second is normal for a leader.
1332904949240516610 2020-11-29 12:31:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 @ancap_oracle Pork was probably the most unreasonably maligned aspect of Congressional budgets. We’ve trimmed a lot of it and what has it gotten us?

1332900757855670272 2020-11-29 12:14:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 @ancap_oracle Harding was one of the most corrupt Presidents in our history. An administration of base graft.

1332884215076171777 2020-11-29 11:08:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @emeriticus If you expect candidates for office to endorse the right person in every election, you’re too stupid to actually have a reasonable conversation with. Which is why I have you on mute and you’re now going on block.

1332880042314129409 2020-11-29 10:52:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Lol, Wyoming going to be 52/60 in the State House.
1332879703670190080 2020-11-29 10:50:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Does anyone know what the phrase “courage of your convictions” means anymore?
1332878800489766913 2020-11-29 10:47:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing Lefties are humorless.
1332877665334910977 2020-11-29 10:42:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Timcast It’s literally the law right now lol.
1332876727446540288 2020-11-29 10:39:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The legal argument is so solid the Democratic Supreme Court had to go like “you should have sued before!” Imagine believing such tricks were valid morally.
1332874147408596994 2020-11-29 10:28:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden You’re making too much sense for Pedro. We all know “there is no political solution” besides constantly whining on Twitter lol.
1332864059193102337 2020-11-29 09:48:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @radiationorgan They were a bit surprised when civil war didn’t erupt over the first contested election.
1332863917941469185 2020-11-29 09:48:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @radiationorgan I don’t think the Founders really envisioned people slavishly following the forms while ignoring the substance of the purpose like we do.
1332861416198508550 2020-11-29 09:38:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> A nation’s constitution should always serve the moral law, not be in contradiction to it. When the constitution is being used as a tool to suppress morality, it is no longer legitimate and it is the moral duty of the authorities to reform it to promote morality again.
1332860179965222912 2020-11-29 09:33:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The moral law is more easily discernible than constitutional norms because the moral law is written on our hearts. Consider this when there is a day of decision in our political life.
1332852865715593218 2020-11-29 09:04:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realDharmapala @PereGrimmer It’s such a sham.

1332835699565989891 2020-11-29 07:56:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ClassicalTheis The remedy would be to completely decertify the election, not throw out the ballot entirely. At least that’s what courts have done in the past.
1332834657449242625 2020-11-29 07:51:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Such rank corruption.
1332827207119609856 2020-11-29 07:22:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy The things we’re pointing aren’t even the “evidence” we’re point to. We’re just saying we smell a rat and want to look into it based on this stuff. The affidavit filings and the rejection rates are the real meat of our evidence.
1332824951364198403 2020-11-29 07:13:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mskoffdmrblkpll @realikamusume It’s like you can’t read vote totals.
1332824029233897479 2020-11-29 07:09:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mskoffdmrblkpll @realikamusume Did you even read the Trump platform from 2016? The tax cuts and Obamacare repeal were in there.
1332823759779229703 2020-11-29 07:08:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 Typically this is something you could see more for Trump. The Trump-only or Trump-Dem down ballot voter is a working class male who doesn’t trust Congressional Republicans: A common type.
1332823476126834691 2020-11-29 07:07:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 It’s just incredibly difficult to model who this “Biden-only” voter is especially because we have so few places they occur.
1332822942808469506 2020-11-29 07:05:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mskoffdmrblkpll @realikamusume The GOP needs a healthcare plan, sure. Only a charismatic leader will be able to accomplish this, though, and it was never Trump’s issue besides pointing out the obvious flaws in the corporate welfare program that is Obamacare. GOP aren’t “free market fundamentalists,” though.
1332821723025203204 2020-11-29 07:00:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Yeah, that’s too close. The hearing is happening regardless it sounds like. Perhaps Court efforts will prevent Arizona from sending Biden electors.
1332821202323304450 2020-11-29 06:58:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mskoffdmrblkpll @realikamusume Healthcare couldn’t even get Bernie close in the DEMOCRAT primaries lol. GOP can’t run around and lose its base pursuing a government healthcare scheme.  Also, if he lost among White men, it’s because their GFs bitched at them and nothing more.
1332820490298290177 2020-11-29 06:55:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 But, only Biden? Surely they’d have voted for a Republican down ballot. Keep in mind the Atlanta suburban swings are the largest of any suburbs.
1332820080602865669 2020-11-29 06:54:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Why? Ducey at least seems cooperative. Makes it a bit easier.
1332819777295966208 2020-11-29 06:52:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 The Biden-only votes are the real kickers in these disputed states. The only state besides the battlegrounds where they seem have happened much at all is Texas. And they only happen in these totally unaccountable counties.
1332819295987003395 2020-11-29 06:50:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I think pols like Ted Cruz have learned enough from Trump that they can win these places if they take the lessons to heart long term.
1332817037643681792 2020-11-29 06:41:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PerfInjust This is ultimately why I didn’t pursue an academic career personally. The number of posts an illiberal Reformed Christian can hold is sparingly few.
1332815535680139264 2020-11-29 06:36:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> That, and Cobb County is one of the locations of the pristine Biden-only absentees.
1332815054161534979 2020-11-29 06:34:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It’s not about vote share. The fact Democrat margins in terms of raw votes (the thing that actually wins elections) increased so drastically despite overwhelming evidence of urban dissatisfaction with Democrats is exactly why this is so suspicious.
1332798637705994241 2020-11-29 05:28:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Media causes this dynamic where ancestral conservative Democrats have little idea how liberal Democrats are, but ancestral liberal Republicans are aware of the conservative GOP drift.

1332789227218759683 2020-11-29 04:51:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> “As late as...” as if this wasn’t a brief interlude and likely not reflective of opinions outside the seminaries and clerical class.

1332779911971532800 2020-11-29 04:14:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The entire process of investigating potential election fraud is deeply flawed in this country. The people in charge of it are the very people who would commit it.
1332779465458511873 2020-11-29 04:12:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Milwaukee County Clerk investigates himself and finds himself innocent. Checkmate, Trumpers.
1332771978642649089 2020-11-29 03:42:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SloyerCo This is essentially the view of the conservatives who are like “Biden cheated fair and square and there’s nothing we can do about it now.”
1332767435313786880 2020-11-29 03:24:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I once again am confused by the view of some that the American Republic and Constitution is somehow immune from the forces of history because someone bothered to write it down.
1332765708124614657 2020-11-29 03:18:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Blair_A_Nathan I have a vague memory of knowing this.   Enoch Powell was an incredibly popular guy for most of his career: A true Renaissance man. Perhaps the last true British (Anglo?) statesman. They suppressed him for this of course.
1332758507188326400 2020-11-29 02:49:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I only support banana republics in places that grow a lot of bananas.

1332755165976391694 2020-11-29 02:36:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks Why I tend to think it needs to be full scorched earth from here on out if Trump gets a second term. No pussyfooting around: Destroy their institutions root and branch.
1332751680706842626 2020-11-29 02:22:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is actually why the Brexit Referendum Law passed in the 55th Parliament was such a sham: It was totally non-binding on the Parliament under which the referendum would have occurred (likely the 56th).
1332750985496850433 2020-11-29 02:19:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The privilege of selecting electors is solely with the state legislature. It is a long standing rule of law that no legislature can bind a future legislature to an action. A legislature thus cannot surrender the right of a future legislature to select electors.
1332744833019113474 2020-11-29 01:55:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Polls, as we know, are a rational excuse for ditching election integrity laws. When one candidate is ahead by ten points: Who cares if there’s fraud?
1332729475524653062 2020-11-29 00:54:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LokiJulianus That’s probably what he’s doing. It’s dumb.

1332727351944339462 2020-11-29 00:45:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 To be fair, one of those guys was Charlie Crist.

1332721993653825538 2020-11-29 00:24:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp They mostly seem averse to taking any sick leave whatsoever. Most of them are workaholics in the bad way.
1332721417335529472 2020-11-29 00:22:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I haven’t, but it seems the PMCs decided it was an annual ritual sometime in the past few years. It used to only be recommended if you were under 12 and over 65 or had some kind of immune problem.
1332719005845622786 2020-11-29 00:12:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly Literacy was much lower in the pre-alphabet days because the symbols were too complex for most people to memorize. Once the alphabet standardized symbol-&gt;pronunciation, more and more people were able to read at a level where they could at least engage in literate commerce.

1332548131960053760 2020-11-28 12:53:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 It’s a reach. It is precedented to declare the “loser” the “winner” because of fraud, though. Throwing out a whole category of ballots seems dubious, though.
1332547679566618624 2020-11-28 12:51:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Is anyone actually able to see, in their mind’s eye, a Biden Presidency? I just can’t see it.
1332547135934500865 2020-11-28 12:49:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 Usually the whole election is vacated and rerun. They don’t just throw out all ballots of a certain category.

1332517856718823425 2020-11-28 10:53:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CatholicEcon It’s because the GOP isn’t as deeply rooted there. Georgia GOP has never really had a strong machine associated with it, except for the Perdue machine which Kemp isn’t friends with.
1332517157868072964 2020-11-28 10:50:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CatholicEcon They’re just inept. Consider the Georgia GOP only elected its first Governor in 2002.

1332493198149758976 2020-11-28 09:15:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This was exactly what we were looking for with this recount. It was the entire point of it.

You can't pass a law that binds another Congress to not use its prerogative. So, if Congress can reject electors, Congress can't pass a law saying a future Congress must accept them if they're verified by X date.

1332427731489984515 2020-11-28 04:55:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @antifapiggy Their claim lacked “merit” as a matter of law based on the idea they claimed grievance too late. Actually read the decision. The judges haven’t even heard evidence. Any opinion they state on the evidence is irrelevant.
1332426036777246721 2020-11-28 04:48:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The two main legal arguments (regardless of evidence) from the opposing side are essentially that:  1. Trump should have complained sooner. 2. There's no remedy.  The first amounts to requiring minority report prediction of future criminal behavior. The second is just wrong.
1332422428199366661 2020-11-28 04:33:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @travis_john78 @Barnes_Law That still doesn't matter. If it goes to the SCOTUS, it's all persuasive precedent anything. There's no legal mechanism by which the Supreme Court can bind itself to not using its own legal reasoning from a prior case or even reject it entirely.

1332418614771769344 2020-11-28 04:18:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Because the Republicans aren't totally gay now too. We're all in this boat together.
1332417680557690887 2020-11-28 04:15:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Tories would back such a move too. He's the rightful head of state until he surrenders that.

1332406531149754368 2020-11-28 03:30:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Truth_Reaction He's introducing a resolution for the legislature to appoint electors.
1332405202159329280 2020-11-28 03:25:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy You have to consider his approval ratings spoiled at this point too. They want you to believe Trump never had a single day above 50% approval, yet he got 74 million votes. Certainly Trump hatred wasn't that feverishly hot for four years straight.

1332395391325786113 2020-11-28 02:46:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 It's such an inherently unjust and ridiculous opinion. It literally is a license to commit mass fraud. "Oh, you can just break chains of custody on hundreds of thousands of ballots and because we know some of them were real, you have to count all of them." Pure bunk.
1332394638834081793 2020-11-28 02:43:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "You need to prove fraud." Excuse me, I don't have to prove any particular ballot is bad. That's voter fraud. Election fraud is conducted through large scale breaks in secure chain of custody, which particularly happened in Pennsylvania and Georgia.
1332394140789780480 2020-11-28 02:41:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is why chain of custody is important in elections. In order to have a genuinely secure election, you need a rock solid chain of custody on ballots. If you have hundreds of thousands of ballots without a proper chain of custody, then the election is, by nature, illegitimate.
1332393082147442693 2020-11-28 02:37:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Anyone who has ever worked in a secure facility realizes security means paranoia.
1332390843706118144 2020-11-28 02:28:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BorealReinhard Appellate courts don't hear evidence in the first place. The fact they are even talking about it is wrong. They're supposed to rule on the law, not the evidence. The law interacts with the evidence, but these courts are basically suggesting there's no relief for election fraud.

1332385662998294528 2020-11-28 02:07:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The legal "reasoning" of judges who dismiss election fraud claims appears to be "I see nothing, I hear nothing, I know nothing."  https://t.co/0gx5lN4Hp4
1332383564642586625 2020-11-28 01:59:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 Precisely. This is very typical of courts in election fraud cases.

1332365704826384384 2020-11-28 00:48:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> You see the same sort evidence denialism in both instances: Dismissal of eyewitness testimony. Use of technicality (“It wasn’t said in court!”) to avoid acknowledgment of evidence. Unreasonable standards of evidence based on philosophical priors that themselves are dubious.
1332365189421953026 2020-11-28 00:46:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> You can transmit this to materialist skepticism of miracles where this phrase is usually used. If you’re already a confirmed believer in a spiritual metaphysic, miracles aren’t “extraordinary” in any meaningful sense. They might be rare events, but not implausible.
1332364757001777152 2020-11-28 00:44:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The main problem with this phrase is the phrase “extraordinary” is very subjective and built on the person’s intellectual priors. To me, the idea they’d try to steal an election from Trump isn’t really an extraordinary claim given the events of the past few years.

1332350091861123072 2020-11-27 23:46:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar Assuming it stayed roughly the same, you’re still looking at a 90% or so turnout rate.

1332344855146729476 2020-11-27 23:25:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RadicalLib @KingofShirgar @YouTube The Cathedral's reaction to him is the strongest evidence he's the real deal on some level, to be honest. The establishment just has problems with people who are the genuine article, regardless of their particular political beliefs. They prefer people they can control.

1332340947582136321 2020-11-27 23:10:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Anton56422519 Israel, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain all have more motive to do this directly and a history of using such methods.  Also, let's not neglect it could have been an inside job. Let's not pretend Iran are the "good guys" or something.
1332340281908277251 2020-11-27 23:07:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> With the Biden only printed Georgia ballots: I'd honestly sooner believe them if they were marked "Biden-Perdue-Loeffler." It would at least fit the narrative of Republicans sick of Trump.
1332339410298417154 2020-11-27 23:04:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I honestly doubt we had anything to do with the assassination in Iran today.

1332200966465200128 2020-11-27 13:53:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Pennsylvania Democrats were so excited about the election, only about 20K requested a mail in ballot each day and most of the requests just carried over from the primary. Totally why they have the highest return rate in the country.

1331848339176960001 2020-11-26 14:32:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @HeritageNLegacy I mean most law students anywhere (besides a few explicitly conservative law schools) are pure wokeists lol. Top ranked school with a conservative rep these days is Notre Dame, but even that isn’t really well earned.
1331847996556906496 2020-11-26 14:31:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @RupertVonRipp Harvard Yale Stanford: The perennial top three law schools.
1331847282468249600 2020-11-26 14:28:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @HeritageNLegacy Probably. First you have to get over the hurdle of HYS admittance. Then you have to land your clerkships. Then you have to make political connections. Then you have to pray some politician isn’t look to fill some quota.
1331846860668014592 2020-11-26 14:26:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @HeritageNLegacy It does. He was actually supposed to be to the left of Roberts according to most legal commentators at the time (they were nominated so close together). One of the few Justices that has gotten more conservative as time goes on too. Maybe Scalia and Thomas made an impression.

1331844189580038144 2020-11-26 14:16:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NRxAuthors That’s not true. He was on the right side of Heller and McDonald, which were both 5-4 decisions.

1331843585541632000 2020-11-26 14:13:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp He ruled against gay marriage.
1331843233215868928 2020-11-26 14:12:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NRxAuthors I mean he has sided with the conservatives *most* of the time up until the past year. I don’t even know what his philosophy is anymore.

1331730052485173249 2020-11-26 06:42:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ruintal @SelimSeesYou Here's how it works: Majority of state delegation votes for candidate: Vote counted. No candidate with a majority of the delegation: No vote. Need a majority of states to win. Could see dozens of ballots and the House gridlocked on other business.
1331729695214350338 2020-11-26 06:41:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ruintal @SelimSeesYou Funny thing is I think something like that is more likely from the Democrat side. If that happens, I can see Pence easily being confirmed by the Senate while the House is in gridlock (takes 26 states) because states can't cast votes. Pence could end up President for a while.
1331729098582974471 2020-11-26 06:38:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar I'm fast becoming a permanent Jenna Ellis simp lol.
1331728745296781314 2020-11-26 06:37:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ruintal @SelimSeesYou Top three in the House and top two in the Senate: Biden, Trump (insert any faithless elector votes there might be) in the House. Pence vs. Harris in the Senate. Pence can break a tie for himself.
1331728132597026820 2020-11-26 06:35:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @insanerap1st @SelimSeesYou Oh, he won't say it like that. He won't move on from the steal. He might cease contesting this election formally, though. I pray he doesn't, of course. I'm all for Plan B.
1331727888794652672 2020-11-26 06:34:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ruintal @SelimSeesYou However, if Biden electors are sent without an alternative Trump slate also sent, it would likely be bad news.
1331727744527372289 2020-11-26 06:33:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ruintal @SelimSeesYou It isn't really truly over until the House confirms the electors and they are counted and one of the candidates has 270 or more of them.
1331727435205906448 2020-11-26 06:32:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Precisely: Even when it's time to take a breather because the die is cast, we still never move on from the steal.

Federal corruption now is a lot more targeted than it was in the 30s and 40s when revenuers were blatantly framing random farmers.
1331718605151612935 2020-11-26 05:57:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SixDegreesOfBob @SelimSeesYou I'm not sure about that. Pardons were a lot higher back then because our courts used to be more corrupt to ordinary people than they are today. They're corrupt now too, but not usually for railroading hundreds of innocent men a year.
1331718185356242948 2020-11-26 05:55:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hail__To_You @SelimSeesYou I mean, if he's going to hand them out like candy, might as well ask "trick or treat?"

1331711987848507398 2020-11-26 05:30:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MosleyGang Powell had asked him to not do the pardon because she wanted the charges dismissed the normal way. Pretty clear they're trying to stall that indefinitely and it's a nice holiday gift for the General.
1331711510918393862 2020-11-26 05:29:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy This whole covid thing has really revealed how most of the big wignats are literally just racist PMC libs.
1331710143558541316 2020-11-26 05:23:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CRFlixxx @JadenPMcNeil That is not clear. Also, if we have proof they threw them away, then we have proof of a Federal felony.
1331709716096028673 2020-11-26 05:21:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Do the Georgia people think the Senators can call special session of the State Legislature? Do they realize Kemp probably has as much problem with the Perdue machine as he does Trump?
1331709344463917061 2020-11-26 05:20:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CRFlixxx @JadenPMcNeil They have called for signature matching. Once again, you want to punish a confirmed immigration hawk and a solid Trump ally because they don't immediately issue more meaningless statements despite having reaffirmed their support for Trump's efforts multiple times.

1331706999147532288 2020-11-26 05:11:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PrimetimePurity He's more libertarian leaning. He's not like a doctrinaire laissez faire capitalist or anything like that. He's more socially moderate in that sense.

1331687667399069696 2020-11-26 03:54:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I like the tone from the Chairman.  "Most important hearing in 100 years!"
1331686732958490628 2020-11-26 03:50:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon @PennsylvaniaGOP Kelli Ward, Paul Gosar, and even Doug Ducey are doing a good job in Arizona.
1331686279990431749 2020-11-26 03:48:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates So we can coverup the biggest fraud scheme in an American election in history.
1331686145885937667 2020-11-26 03:48:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is how Democrats lose margins among Mexicans to a man who started his campaign in 2015 by implying many of them were rapists and wanting to build a wall on the Mexican border.
1331685720705159172 2020-11-26 03:46:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Repeat after me: Witness testimony is evidence.  Also repeat after me: Coverup is itself evidence of a crime.
1331685069988179971 2020-11-26 03:43:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Q&amp;A: Should give us an idea of what the Senators are thinking.
1331682997679034374 2020-11-26 03:35:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Good riddance.
1331681948373295110 2020-11-26 03:31:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 Perhaps, we will see though.
1331681479970222084 2020-11-26 03:29:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy By phone, yes.
1331681442397646848 2020-11-26 03:29:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @penni1153 I actually agree it's unconstitutional to have these voting machines for this reason, but it's not compelling.
1331681282263306246 2020-11-26 03:28:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I don't like the tone of these Senators.
1331681114474373124 2020-11-26 03:28:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump joins the hearings.
1331680565104406529 2020-11-26 03:26:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The old people having computer problems are probably the least convincing of these witnesses.
1331678435941490691 2020-11-26 03:17:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou All you need to do is show more votes are doubtful than the margin of victory.
1331675946273939459 2020-11-26 03:07:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 Seems a bit too good to be true lol.
1331673303954714632 2020-11-26 02:57:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KarnatakaYankee @SelimSeesYou Yes, they are:  https://t.co/wcEbrmwaeT
1331672671646527488 2020-11-26 02:54:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The man who was denied observation of the polls on election day is up.
1331672284210270208 2020-11-26 02:53:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Incredibly strong case being made. Lots of witnesses. The Dominion stuff is being used properly: Identifying it with mail in ballots that weren't properly observed with ridiculous margins. Setting up a strong narrative of what exactly happened.
1331671825642901507 2020-11-26 02:51:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou You watching the PA hearings?
1331671333105758216 2020-11-26 02:49:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @AStratelates The problem is you can't certify an alternative result. You can only rerun it.
1331671149865021440 2020-11-26 02:48:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy Just consider that the CNN exit poll was the best exit poll for a Republican in the modern era. Exit polls have systematically underestimated all Republicans since 2000. That's why Florida got called too early. That's why everyone thought Kerry won in 04. Clinton 16.
1331670109539143688 2020-11-26 02:44:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates It's a Federal felony. 22 months for all elections records.
1331669925446955010 2020-11-26 02:43:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @justaplebe_ian @news_revolver @NationalistTV Biden: 61.7-&gt;63.2. Trump: 31.6-&gt;34.3. Overall, Trump's margin improved 1.2%. Marginal, but was very strategically located to recover several House seats over 2018.
1331669260167483392 2020-11-26 02:41:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates Democrats eliminated the chain of custody of the votes in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. ELIMINATED.
1331668897544740878 2020-11-26 02:39:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Listening to this hearing while working: "No evidence" my ass.
1331668704862613505 2020-11-26 02:38:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @justaplebe_ian @news_revolver @NationalistTV Seems to have stayed stable with 2016 among Cali Whites while improving marginally with Hispanics, particularly strategically placed Hispanics in the California swing districts.
1331666956764770304 2020-11-26 02:31:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @justaplebe_ian @news_revolver @NationalistTV It is likely he did better among Cali Latinos. That's the driver of him gaining 3% share in the state overall. The Whites are very educated in California overall
1331665875850694656 2020-11-26 02:27:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AboveIvan @NationalistTV You know they change these percentages to reflect the purported results, right? This wasn't what they looked like when they came in and they don't really make much sense on the whole.
1331664833767469058 2020-11-26 02:23:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roland_Gunn2 Trump rallies were packed with attractive women too lol.
1331664476484014085 2020-11-26 02:22:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 @NationalistTV It's in the recount stage, but they're denying an audit. Lawsuits pending.
1331663783090155520 2020-11-26 02:19:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV I'll spell it out: F-R-A-U-D.
1331662428455702536 2020-11-26 02:13:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 @NationalistTV This is why it's dumb to promote any narrative right now besides fraud. This was either an unprecedented realigning election or it was fraud. Would take an in depth study to understand the exact nature of the realignment.
1331660951070928904 2020-11-26 02:08:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @news_revolver @NationalistTV If we can't sort out the election, it will take an incredibly in depth study to understand what happened here electorally. It doesn't really make sense.
1331660227234701315 2020-11-26 02:05:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @news_revolver @NationalistTV I honestly think it underestimates his Latino improvement. His performance in South Texas and Florida alone are enough to get in the upper 30s among Hispanics.
1331658275784433665 2020-11-26 01:57:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ClassicalTheis Well, it is Will Chamberlain and that’s been true for a while.
1331657404782620673 2020-11-26 01:54:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So CNN lied and was proven to have lied in less than an hour lol.
1331650061802070016 2020-11-26 01:24:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @juukuchi @JayFiveK It’s challenging the constitutionality of the entire mail in voting scheme.
1331649452961099778 2020-11-26 01:22:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK This particular case could basically toss the whole election in Pennsylvania. Including down ballot.
1331644173364191234 2020-11-26 01:01:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Evidentiary hearing. You know, one where the parties present evidence.
1331641962554863616 2020-11-26 00:52:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer Soon you'll open up a car review video and it will be like "the AP has called the election, it's ogre."
1331639768506126336 2020-11-26 00:43:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Now they're saying Giuliani isn't going to the hearing either. A bit confused since @JennaEllisEsq had said they already left.
1331636616381820931 2020-11-26 00:31:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LokiJulianus I wouldn't read too much into this because several of the other states had access to in person early voting and Pennsylvania did not.
1331633870203129859 2020-11-26 00:20:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Gay
1331633685599285249 2020-11-26 00:19:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Firing squads.....hmmm
1331631185081077761 2020-11-26 00:09:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 Well, he doesn't drink. Maybe high on life?
1331630499316584449 2020-11-26 00:07:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed @timesnewemma They aren't in the good churches, sad to say.
1331625646699782151 2020-11-25 23:47:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Democrats: Believe all women.  Also Democrats: I refuse to believe eyewitness testimony to events that happened three weeks ago because they benefit my team.
1331624648946102282 2020-11-25 23:43:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton It's literally what they designed democracy for in Athens. This is always couched in terms of holding back dangerous strong men and tyrants, but it often just leaves people helpless when faced with a crisis.
1331623338532347906 2020-11-25 23:38:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperNugget @JadenPMcNeil They back Trump:  https://t.co/1jjvLSK0e3
1331623194948722688 2020-11-25 23:38:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CRFlixxx @JadenPMcNeil They already have called for this multiple times:  https://t.co/1jjvLSK0e3
1331622966262632453 2020-11-25 23:37:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Political opposition to neoliberal policies and openly speaking about potential election fraud is "sedition" according to the left now. These are incredibly dangerous people.
1331618867085529095 2020-11-25 23:20:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Bets on how many of these signatures are squiggly lines or written in crayon saying "I am the voter"?
1331473678735986689 2020-11-25 13:43:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MosleyGang @RealAPolitics The symbolism has epic potential.
1331473226548072448 2020-11-25 13:42:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sorrowen @SelimSeesYou Pennsylvania is bad overall, but it’s more dispersed. Georgia is basically all concentrated in like three counties.
1331472955734364162 2020-11-25 13:41:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @6998sara I’m not for punishing Perdue (a good Senator) over other’s actions, but it’s really rich to see Ann and Ryan unconditionally backing Perdue when they’d snipe at Trump constantly in the months leading up to the elections.
1331472510198624256 2020-11-25 13:39:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sorrowen @SelimSeesYou And their numbers are some of the most ridiculous. There’s less signs of fraud in Philadelphia than the Atlanta Metro: Ridiculous margins, Biden only ballots, bad registration addresses, out of state voters, no signature matching at all. All well documented at this point.
1331471763042078722 2020-11-25 13:36:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TrustThePlant @SelimSeesYou They’d probably be as happy to be rid of the Perdue machine as well. Two birds with one stone. One reason why I think it’s really dumb to punish an immigration hawk like David Perdue because Kemp and Raffensperger are playing games.
1331470716173225989 2020-11-25 13:32:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Hopefully Georgia ends up sorted out in court.
1331465775459282944 2020-11-25 13:12:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Everyone knows that the best way to prevent potential election fraud is by aggressively censoring those who claim it might exist, call them cranks, and then pray your country doesn’t turn into third world sham.
1331461171069808641 2020-11-25 12:54:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The symbolism of this could be Epic.
1331459136815583235 2020-11-25 12:46:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's amazing how the conservative intelligentsia has just totally lost all credibility with the base progressively since 2015.
1331456637027180544 2020-11-25 12:36:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal She said there'd be a flurry of lawsuits this week. Tick tock on that.
1331456376128802816 2020-11-25 12:35:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal I imagine this is what lawyers feel like when they're about to crack a witness, but I don't know.
1331455678255407105 2020-11-25 12:32:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Jenna's angry.
1331451804572409856 2020-11-25 12:17:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Super_Lutheran That looks like poison.
1331451217990590465 2020-11-25 12:14:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks @EndDemocracy The first rule of Plan B is no one talks about Plan B.
1331448762770788353 2020-11-25 12:04:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wizard_Predicts You’re giving Biden an extra elector in Maine.
1331444672556904450 2020-11-25 11:48:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I wonder what our ancestors would think if we just casually stood by while an election was stolen by a candidate and party who promised to destroy our way of life?
1331440257301159937 2020-11-25 11:31:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Contestation can still move forward.
1331438568607260672 2020-11-25 11:24:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MitchellYTweets There's so many problems. The only benefit is it's high reward if you succeed. Just the odds off success are next to nil.
1331437547914997760 2020-11-25 11:20:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The main problem with a third party: If you can't win a partisan primary, how do you expect to win a general election?
1331434796749348864 2020-11-25 11:09:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon The House GOP will not vote Biden.
1331431422045933568 2020-11-25 10:56:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So, prevent Arizona, Wisconsin, and Georgia from sending electors and Basement Biden is at 269.
1331431096756686848 2020-11-25 10:54:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 @JayFiveK @SelimSeesYou If Biden gets in (Heaven Forbid it), just about any Republican could win that seat.
1331430263348408321 2020-11-25 10:51:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 @JayFiveK @SelimSeesYou Not even they’re that shameless. Ducey appointed her because he wants the seat.
1331430093948940289 2020-11-25 10:50:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theeternalright @DrPaulGosar He’s doing good work as well.
1331429738829803521 2020-11-25 10:49:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Yes.
1331429192152604672 2020-11-25 10:47:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Kelli Ward is back again to try to singlehandedly save Arizona from national embarrassment.

1331426693693771776 2020-11-25 10:37:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Scott Peterson gets paid while your family has its business destroyed.
1331426026803646471 2020-11-25 10:34:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal I don’t think that’s the point of it: Just not buying random Polish Jews teach their kids to say God Bless America. And the guy in the tank just so happens to be Black? Yeah, sure.
1331425021106016259 2020-11-25 10:30:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Anyone else get the feeling this story is extremely convenient?
1331418309607165957 2020-11-25 10:03:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Wait, I thought Trump's lawyers were just a bunch of cranks and there was "no evidence" for election fraud?
1331415486106636290 2020-11-25 09:52:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @OVonReuenthal Barrett has a good track record on immigration and the law here is extremely clear.
1331415262529286144 2020-11-25 09:51:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @OVonReuenthal There is at least a law there, if misapplied. No way this would hold up in court.
1331412626384031744 2020-11-25 09:41:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @OVonReuenthal That wasn't granting them citizenship, though.
1331401422139691008 2020-11-25 08:56:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IndependentUnd1 I am sincere as well.
1331400980425019392 2020-11-25 08:55:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MarchinThruGA Trump just doesn't leave.
1331400307423764487 2020-11-25 08:52:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> More reason for Plan B.
1331396623415599109 2020-11-25 08:37:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jhhhhhhhnnnnnn1 @SelimSeesYou Very pro-Trump.
1331390233427013634 2020-11-25 08:12:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL They say this while most of their people openly speak of punishing Trump Admin people through four years of show trials on made up charges of "sedition" where "sedition" is defined as "not agreeing with permanent government apparatchiks."
1331387932230488065 2020-11-25 08:03:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Maybe start by not trying end our careers and, in some cases, our very lives because we have differing political opinions. Seems a bit too late for that now.
1331387700755263490 2020-11-25 08:02:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton That’s pretty cool.
1331387245983657992 2020-11-25 08:00:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I like how so many of our political analogies are built on a polity that has been essentially dead for 1500+ years and existed 5000 miles away.
1331381410289037312 2020-11-25 07:37:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NRxAuthors I’ll take the case on its own merits. I literally do not care what the MSM says.
1331374626174332929 2020-11-25 07:10:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy That’s my main focus. Just a bit worried this can turn into a big distraction.
1331370844195581963 2020-11-25 06:55:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theeternalright I trust all of the people involved. They’re just talking so big it’s hard to believe.
1331369225877909506 2020-11-25 06:48:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon Half of any likes on a Biden tweet are bought and paid for lol.
1331367759989633032 2020-11-25 06:43:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JadenPMcNeil Perdue is an immigration hawk and Loeffler ran as “to the right of Attila the Hun.” These aren’t the right targets, sorry.

1331366900815826949 2020-11-25 06:39:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’ll be honest: I have a bad feeling about this.
1331366626772578319 2020-11-25 06:38:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou This is straight gaslighting lmfao.

Definitely feel like a lot of different elements of the right are coalescing behind the 2020 steal narrative. Not just the election steal, but covid and the transfer of wealth from the country to the hands of a few global behemoths.

Simply too many people are openly disobeying the authorities at this point. At least 40% of the voting public believes the election was stolen, likely more. Covid narrative is falling apart. Don't see this lasting.
1331356243554918404 2020-11-25 05:57:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 That's literally exactly what happened.
1331355493839859713 2020-11-25 05:54:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We're already going for ANC levels of White dispossession.
1331355152238993409 2020-11-25 05:52:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnbourbon98 People have a sense that if one thing is wrong, everything is tainted.

1331340827130523651 2020-11-25 04:56:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PrimetimePurity I can't find anything about this.
1331340500142616579 2020-11-25 04:54:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This may or may not be true. I do distinctly remember Barris and Barnes mentioning the margin would narrow in Arizona yesterday, though.
1331340337651052549 2020-11-25 04:54:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ZokharSarniev I don't know...I was inclined to believe based on something Barnes and Baris said yesterday on their show about the margin narrowing. Neither of them are inclined to believe wild rumors.
1331339575894155268 2020-11-25 04:51:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PrimetimePurity Baris and Barnes mentioned the margin in Arizona would narrow. What is the source of the rumor, then?

1331335873284202499 2020-11-25 04:36:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Pozzidonius1 I got an armory. Kind of just what I buy when I have a few hundred lying around burning a hole in my pocket.
1331335601493340170 2020-11-25 04:35:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I was wrong about Oregon: Apparently they're at 80% too of registered voters voting. Wikipedia for some reason uses registered voter participation in some states and eligible voters in others.
1331334929297379341 2020-11-25 04:32:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @antifapiggy @davidchapman141 It repeats itself in Kentucky and across working class White America. Trump just got more votes among his base. You can argue he lost from some other group, but he certainly didn't lose because he lost working class Whites.
1331333846143561729 2020-11-25 04:28:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Oregon actually experienced a decrease in terms of registered voters voting, very marginal, though: From 80.3%-&gt;79.9%. Also universal mail in state.
1331332013731831811 2020-11-25 04:21:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So, Washington State participation went from 78.76% of registered voters to 83.5% of registered voters. This seems like a good control group from a high participation all mail in state.
1331329754356719617 2020-11-25 04:12:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad No one's doubting this was a high turnout year. What people are questioning more specifically is the total lack of ballot rejections, combined with the turnout, combined with particularly high turnout in certain key locations driven by votes that weren't reported until later.
1331329366672936960 2020-11-25 04:10:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Chfl_malcontent It won't be, and no one on the legal side (even the more conspiracy driven folks) has mentioned it much, if at all. However, it's all very suspicious looking from the outside in, especially combined with the total lack of ballot rejections.
1331328981677846528 2020-11-25 04:08:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Universal mail in voting state Washington is usually 80%, btw. Oregon closer to 70%. Washington has pretty clean rolls since the mid-2000s because of the 2004 steal the King County Democrats engaged in.
1331328426054217729 2020-11-25 04:06:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Pennsylvania turnout was supposedly 83% of active registered voters.
1331327695410618368 2020-11-25 04:03:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad Washington has much cleaner rolls than Pennsylvania does too because the Secretary of State has been Republican since 1965 and they've been doing regular roll purges since 2006 or so.
1331327528875798528 2020-11-25 04:03:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad Turnout in Pennsylvania was actually about 77% of all registered voters, including inactive voters. It is 83% when you include only active voters. Washington, is usually 80%, and that's highly affected by King County fraud itself.
1331326135037210624 2020-11-25 03:57:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad None of those states had universal mail in voting, though.   Also, where did you get the turnout rates for 2020? I'm pretty sure turnout was higher in Pennsylvania overall. However, the particular problem is insane turnout in a few key areas that don't make sense.
1331324947667554306 2020-11-25 03:52:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Charlygirl101 @Breaking911 Of course the reporter, silly.

Sometimes, I doubt ascertaining the true nature of events today is even possible for average man such as ourselves. We can all smell the rats, though.
1331322458922741762 2020-11-25 03:43:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lauraka09619649 Reminds me of the phrase I learned back when I supported Ron Paul: "Truth is treason in an empire of lies." Feels like that's where we are now, even more so than 2008.
1331320573914468361 2020-11-25 03:35:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lauraka09619649 I remarked before the election that even if Biden, honest to God, got more legitimate votes than Trump in the swing states, the election was still illegitimate because of this. Imagine listening to the media at this point. Completely dishonest people.
1331319498922729473 2020-11-25 03:31:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This tells me if we had a halfway honest media who actually covered any issues during the campaign, no amount of fraud could have overcome Trump's 49 state landslide re-election and subsequent mass victory parade.

1331316528206188550 2020-11-25 03:19:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So, was the shredding thing in Cobb County the big announcement?
1331316116791189504 2020-11-25 03:17:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rick_Taylor19 @SirDowden This is actually why Democratic Party politics works so much better than Republican Party politics. The Democrats have created over the past 200 years well oiled machines that just pump out votes, real or, if necessary, sometimes fake or coerced.
1331315595619528704 2020-11-25 03:15:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rick_Taylor19 @SirDowden when a pol is going too far off the rez you can run an opponent in the primary and potentially withhold votes in the GE if they're just that bad. The last is kind of a last resort, though. We kind of did it to McCain because of how pointless that struggle was.
1331315337296572422 2020-11-25 03:14:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rick_Taylor19 @SirDowden Yes, sometimes you have to threaten them with not showing up to vote, but this is done diplomatically. "Our people do not like the policies you are pursuing and wish you would take a more hardline stand on X." Sometimes this won't work and you have to be a team player. However,
1331315096627392512 2020-11-25 03:13:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rick_Taylor19 @SirDowden Ultimately the Paul faction split into pro and anti-Trump camps and wasn't able to maintain control. The Pro-Trump people are still influential in the party and the anti have went over to pointless Lolbert voting patterns.
1331314795606380548 2020-11-25 03:12:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rick_Taylor19 @SirDowden What ended up happening was that the Ron Paulers took over the local GOP, basically all the local GOP pols adopted Paul-like positions. This was after I left town, but what eventually happened is the Paul faction lost power after a more pro-Trump faction took hold.
1331314426469888010 2020-11-25 03:11:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rick_Taylor19 @SirDowden The fact it is a political machine is exactly why it can be taken over. It is only concerned about maintaining some semblance of power. You do this by bringing things to the table: Either money or votes (more important in the final analysis). My experience was supporting Ron Paul
1331312864645312515 2020-11-25 03:04:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @barf_captain The problem with all of these trifectas is they were never willing to nuke legislation through the Senate.

1331310733213265921 2020-11-25 02:56:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JonathanTCasey @davidchapman141 Your chief magistrate is. Also, I'm shocked a libertarian would cave to authority like that. LOL.
1331310121155252226 2020-11-25 02:54:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "I'm going to dismiss eyewitnesses with opportunity to actually see something three weeks because maybe we can find witnesses to Trump doing something bad decades ago."
1331309528483291138 2020-11-25 02:51:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JonathanTCasey @davidchapman141 LOL...ok. These people have actually been around the ballots. If you want to make up meaningless hypotheticals so you can lie to yourself about there being "no evidence," go ahead. Just shows your dishonesty as a person.
1331308054122467332 2020-11-25 02:45:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JonathanTCasey @davidchapman141 There are 9 sworn witnesses to extremely suspicious ballots in Cobb and Fulton Counties. You call yourself a Christian. The Bible says 2 witnesses is enough to establish evidence of a crime. Witnesses are evidence. Stop apologizing for a corrupt system.
1331307358073581570 2020-11-25 02:43:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LovebugMAGA We should know by January 5th. I get the anger at the GOP, but directing it at Perdue, who sponsored RAISE, and Loeffler, who has a solid record and ran as "to the right of Attila the Hun" is just cutting off your nose to spite your face even if we want to form a 3rd party.
1331306167163817984 2020-11-25 02:38:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Ending First Past the Post is a curse for the hard right. It is unlikely we will ever be able to get a majority of the vote outright to affect meaningful change. The Ds and Rs would just continuously form a cordon sanitaire around us.
1331305528543342594 2020-11-25 02:35:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaulFor86 @RedEaglePatriot With FPTP, you either can take over one of the major parties in a district, or gather enough momentum to get one more first preference vote in a critical mass of constituencies.
1331305315594366982 2020-11-25 02:34:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaulFor86 @RedEaglePatriot Ending FPTP voting seems like a boon until you realize that European countries that don't have it usually form Cordon Sanitaires around parties like what an America First Party would be.
1331304656904052739 2020-11-25 02:32:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rick_Taylor19 @SirDowden I literally helped take over a county party in a county of about 400K people (swing county, most county officials were Republicans). State Conventions, etc. Never went to a fundraiser, though except the time I crashed the opposing Senate primary candidate's party lol.
1331304238530564096 2020-11-25 02:30:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JonathanTCasey @davidchapman141 So, more cover ups from our courts.
1331303858153418756 2020-11-25 02:29:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaulFor86 @RedEaglePatriot Alaska is a state of around 750,000 people on the fringes of American society. The Alaskan Independence Party fits a niche in Alaskan politics and their formal goal is literal independence from the rest of the country, but they never actually pursue it.
1331302779562975235 2020-11-25 02:24:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All talk of third parties and stuff is premature.
1331302489812062215 2020-11-25 02:23:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MarkFaceBk @RedEaglePatriot Trump's 2000 campaign was quite bizarre, I have to say. Funny to see Buchanan later turn into one of his staunchest defenders.
1331302270634512390 2020-11-25 02:22:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CantusLaudanum We follow the leader around here.
1331301983576317953 2020-11-25 02:21:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rick_Taylor19 @SirDowden Then bring a few average Joes with you.
1331301883022086147 2020-11-25 02:21:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CantusLaudanum Did Trump concede?
1331301042596827137 2020-11-25 02:17:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rick_Taylor19 @SirDowden Maybe if you showed up to a meeting instead of whining about it on the Internet this wouldn't be the case.
1331300620012236806 2020-11-25 02:16:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics He blocked me....Someone with a screenshot?
1331300504488521731 2020-11-25 02:15:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> LOL, @ali blocked me of #StopTheSteal blocked me for some reason. I don't even think I called out his grift directly.
1331298774522732546 2020-11-25 02:08:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm going to LARP that this ends with Trump establishing a new Anglo Imperial dynasty. House of Windsor is getting gayer by the day.
1331297016429809666 2020-11-25 02:01:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cal_of_Cloyne You clearly don't follow this account lol.
1331296620344991745 2020-11-25 02:00:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Because 5% is literally nothing, will disintegrate and no time just like the Reform Party, and there's no need to reinvent the wheel if we just show up for local GOP meetings?
1331295420664979456 2020-11-25 01:55:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Behold, a moral coward.   "This election was stolen fair and square, better luck next time sport."  This isn't a dispute over some pettily ant tax reform. These people want to destroy your businesses, punish you for disagreeing, take basic privileges of citizenship.
1331294204610433031 2020-11-25 01:50:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roland_Gunn2 Trump would get most of the guys with guns on his side anyway.
1331294022124662788 2020-11-25 01:50:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cal_of_Cloyne 80+% &gt; 31%.   This isn't some theory about technicalities like Bush 2000 or whatever. This is a belief by 60+ million people that Democrats just flat our printed ballots. Which is, of course, the truth.
1331292268934930435 2020-11-25 01:43:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar Gotta finesse this vote count, Milwaukee!
1331291381793492993 2020-11-25 01:39:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuthKnight @Charlemagne_03 Think he meant to add a question mark.
1331289812205178884 2020-11-25 01:33:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Azrael556_Fet Trust in media is incredibly low. People just don’t believe this. The fact the polls are even saying over 40% don’t trust the results tells you it’s basically half of relevant people.
1331287028206620675 2020-11-25 01:22:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Biden cheated fair and square ok. Who cares if a third of his votes come from mail in ballots with squiggly line signatures?
1331286277648429062 2020-11-25 01:19:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Azrael556_Fet 40% of the voting population is huge on something like this. It’s not the thoughts of a few cranks and slavish loyalists.
1331284240189808642 2020-11-25 01:11:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Yes, we should just let Biden have the Presidency. Everything will go back to normal then.
1331283521646850048 2020-11-25 01:08:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This was the entire point of threatening the GSA head.
1331283173712474113 2020-11-25 01:06:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump has basically already won the propaganda war on the steal.
1331282075031318528 2020-11-25 01:02:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JurisNaturalism @JayFiveK @apalmerdc I'm allergic to almonds. No wonder I can't stand the thought of a Biden Admin.
1331281334283735043 2020-11-25 00:59:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL It's not even that: It's just stuffy, sweater vest conservatism. It's smug WASPness without any of the gravitas.
1331280972113915910 2020-11-25 00:58:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I try to keep the typos to a minimum here and I do delete sometimes, but doing this all the time ruins the flow of consciousness that is my timeline.
1331280606089666561 2020-11-25 00:56:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Matt Walsh pretending to be the smartest, most dignified man in the room again.   When this guy hits it, he hits it. When he doesn't? Just total cringe.

1331276656837877772 2020-11-25 00:41:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OfficialDavidNC It's more than that in all likelihood.
1331276455389638657 2020-11-25 00:40:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 @LuisBobby3 We definitely have just cause on multiple levels.
1331276061221531648 2020-11-25 00:38:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I still got Biden on block.
1331272257377857539 2020-11-25 00:23:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 There's no circumstances where I give up, but a lot of people just don't get the stakes here.
1331271430747648006 2020-11-25 00:20:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal Daring to be elected and have different policies.
1331269563820990466 2020-11-25 00:12:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We hit it @mccarthywzright!  https://t.co/Inj7bzJBvg
1331269191735906304 2020-11-25 00:11:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright I ticked down to 1998 for a moment lol. Back up.
1331268997363462145 2020-11-25 00:10:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 Yeah, if Trump lost like 74-68, I’d be much more inclined to believe it. 80-74 in the highest turnout election since 1900?
1331268356259901441 2020-11-25 00:08:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Imagine believing Joseph R. Biden got 80 million votes.
1331267140935151629 2020-11-25 00:03:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Someone already filed a contest yesterday according to @Barnes_Law
1331266641267740672 2020-11-25 00:01:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Calm down.
1331266533142781954 2020-11-25 00:00:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright The highest turnout since 1900, right.
1331266180347285508 2020-11-24 23:59:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KlytusKing @JayFiveK Well, you can always go down the Bill Maher-Ann Coulter relationship.   Or the fact Don, Jr. is dating Gavin Newsom's ex-wife.
1331265409295769600 2020-11-24 23:56:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KlytusKing @JayFiveK So, I looked this up, and Olbermann had the audacity to make fun of Laura for being an infotainment chick because she joked that she hadn't had a "real job" after she left her law firm while they were dating.  Tweet had 5K likes. Pot, meet kettle. LMAO.
1331264781769170946 2020-11-24 23:53:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FlycatcherSilky My pleasure. Happy Thanksgiving to you as well!
1331262894684721160 2020-11-24 23:46:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar I feel like he definitely uses the law to his advantage, but the lawyers he surrounds himself do not exactly inspire confidence. Michael Cohen went to Cooley for crying out loud.
1331262257490178050 2020-11-24 23:43:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright "This claim has been deboonked by Reputable Sources(tm)!"

1331260072882810891 2020-11-24 23:35:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK WE WILL NEVER CONCEDE!
1331259683395473411 2020-11-24 23:33:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad I mean this unironically: You got a better chance with the ho.
1331250928213757970 2020-11-24 22:58:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 @JackPosobiec There’s a debate. The wording of the 22nd amendment says you’re no longer eligible to be “elected” President, not “be” President. The only qualification to be elected VP is that you are qualified to be “be” President.
1331249848356646919 2020-11-24 22:54:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 @JackPosobiec There’s theoretically the possibility that you get elected to be Vice President and the President immediately resigns.
1331145992838799360 2020-11-24 16:01:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 Lin Wood got a subpoena for video evidence of fraud and seems to have found it.
1331141362352332800 2020-11-24 15:43:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar Even if the Powell stuff isn’t true, I think Dominion and other election software played a role in this. It helped them assess how many ballots they’d need and print those ballots at minimum. Potentially manually moved or invalidated Trump ballots.
1331139972309585926 2020-11-24 15:37:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IndependentUnd1 @Pozzidonius1 This is defeatism. Look, I get the stakes and I have repeatedly said what I think should be done if we don’t find remedy in law, but until we’re put in literal camps we must fight. Elections have been stolen before. Nothing is new under the sun.
1331138160412291074 2020-11-24 15:30:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Pozzidonius1 Regardless of what happens from here, Trump will likely win the propaganda war about the steal (he effectively has already), and this will be a bludgeon he can use over the next 4 years.
1331137771092799488 2020-11-24 15:29:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Pozzidonius1 This is only amplified by going 3rd party, not alleviated. Also, this is primarily the result of Trump not understanding he had not won the war by winning the election and being magnanimous to his (not yet) defeated foes.
1331135481522892801 2020-11-24 15:20:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Pozzidonius1 What I’m saying is Trump had the right idea to seize control of an existing party. It’s relatively easy to do in the United States and you get with it infrastructure and the vast majority of the partisan loyalists. There are a lot of GOP partisans out there after 164 years.
1331133120104591363 2020-11-24 15:10:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Pozzidonius1 Britain doesn’t have the primary/caucus system as a check on party leadership. Literally all you have to do to take over a local GOP in most counties is show up. From there you take the state, etc.
1331118355076538368 2020-11-24 14:12:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Imagine thinking calling upon the President to do his duty is some kind of crime.
1331115433936756737 2020-11-24 14:00:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Pozzidonius1 Wait, you don’t have one?

Would never fly with a 6-3 court. Yes, he'll expand immigration as much as possible, but they won't be citizens yet. Punishing a confirmed immigration hawk is cutting off your nose to spite your face.

1331100450821722112 2020-11-24 13:00:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Fun fact: It's true.

1331089311375257603 2020-11-24 12:16:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright Obama's first election was won by challenging petition signatures on his opponents' ballot petitions.
1331089184325570562 2020-11-24 12:16:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright My theory is that President Trump is the exact inverse of Obama. If Trump wins re-election by court challenge of mail-in ballot signatures, this theory will be almost complete. The final act is he leaves office more popular than ever, handing off power to a hand picked successor.
1331088110202073089 2020-11-24 12:11:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Yes, Obama was a failed President and left us in this complete wreck. Thankfully President Trump will sort it out by hook or by crook.
1331085773840535552 2020-11-24 12:02:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles @AtlanticAdvo That’s the only realistic plan there ever has been.
1331085573600239617 2020-11-24 12:01:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Woke_TGC I heard Trump committed adultery, so bombing Syrian villages is the only moral alternative.
1331085279025827841 2020-11-24 12:00:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AtlanticAdvo @MeldEndCastles Good point.
1331085132044840962 2020-11-24 12:00:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles @JayFiveK A fraudulent coup by the powers of darkness.
1331084683363446785 2020-11-24 11:58:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @ChickenHalf Well, you really are. All you can do is pray. That’s why I’m not fretting about every twist and then. Yes, I hope Trump has an iron resolve and is will to go through with The Final Act of all else is lost, but that’s not really my decision to make.
1331084317959868416 2020-11-24 11:56:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AtlanticAdvo @MeldEndCastles Maybe because America Firsters aren’t completely cringe and have some sense of how to create a political coalition while TRS folks just want to feel like the smuggest guys in the room?
1331083891566927872 2020-11-24 11:55:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 Sanctimonious to boot.
1331083690462556160 2020-11-24 11:54:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf A lot of people just don’t get what’s at stake. They think we can go back to some kind of normal and play the “we’ll get them next time, old sport” game. They don’t seem to understand the republic is on its last legs and we’re just sorting out what it will look like after.
1331083318666858496 2020-11-24 11:52:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles @AtlanticAdvo I vaguely remember that when I’d occasionally listen. I was a paycuck for them for a couple months out of loyalty because of the podcast. I just stopped caring at a certain point.
1331082160967720960 2020-11-24 11:48:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There's actually a significant number of people who basically believe "Democrats cheated fair and square, Trump should just let Biden have it."
1331081823720534018 2020-11-24 11:46:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles @AtlanticAdvo Wow.
1331079039684145153 2020-11-24 11:35:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles I was told the next President would be Mike Enoch running on the National Justice Party platform. Would probably win a majority of the House and Senate too.
1331075900155236357 2020-11-24 11:23:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There is no dignity in surrender to a band of thugs.
1331069174307835905 2020-11-24 10:56:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou "Administratively cancelled" sounds more like just thrown in the trash.
1331068719720771590 2020-11-24 10:54:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Also, the absentee ballots that the Republicans sent in that got "administratively cancelled" Baris mentioned were a real groin kick.
1331068312634134538 2020-11-24 10:53:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou As they keep pointing out: If they'd have just done proper signature matching, Trump would have won every one of these states with the possible exception of Michigan and that might have been finessed a little more than the others.
1331065173050863616 2020-11-24 10:40:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim John Brennan just looks like he’s possessed.
1331056184665763842 2020-11-24 10:04:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Agreed. @realDonaldTrump: You have a patriotic duty to do everything in your power to stop this.
1331055857656881153 2020-11-24 10:03:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @freshpseudonym I used to be too.
1331055477917093889 2020-11-24 10:02:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Signature matching!
1331054551466713090 2020-11-24 09:58:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @freshpseudonym Why are you overthinking this?
1331052114664189952 2020-11-24 09:48:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @freshpseudonym I interpret the right as order and left as chaos.
1331051099554541569 2020-11-24 09:44:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CantusLaudanum Lol
1331050873317974017 2020-11-24 09:43:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CantusLaudanum Embrace common sense neoplatonism with Thomistic flavors.
1331050501035659265 2020-11-24 09:42:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CantusLaudanum I said “rationally justify.”
1331050446631342080 2020-11-24 09:42:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CantusLaudanum Stop.
1331050195572944896 2020-11-24 09:41:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy I don’t get these guys. They all pretend to be right wing and then can’t follow a leader.
1331049885169311744 2020-11-24 09:39:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I generally take the most hardline right wing position that I can rationally justify to myself on any given position. This goes across politics and theology.
1331047863934136320 2020-11-24 09:31:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realDharmapala Rod Dreher sucks and his ideas for addressing the present crisis are pure grift.
1331041631949246465 2020-11-24 09:07:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 1. He is not the President-Elect.  2. Get rekt. You’re a paid apologist for wanton criminals. You’ll get your reward in this life or the next.
1331032851127676930 2020-11-24 08:32:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat Basically the Democrats threatened to prosecute and personally harass this woman and Trump let her give Biden an office.
1331031180708294660 2020-11-24 08:25:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I think the guy that closest to Trump’s final total vote in Pennsylvania was @RealAPolitics lmao. He estimate 3.4 million and Trump is at like 3.35 last I checked.
1331027630683004930 2020-11-24 08:11:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 Yeah, you guys are known for your government instability lol.
1331025203665788932 2020-11-24 08:01:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright @theeternalright @inteldotwav I support him going for those. But the court process has to play out first for political reasons.
1331023870015500300 2020-11-24 07:56:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 Why not?
1331022727780687874 2020-11-24 07:52:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright @theeternalright @inteldotwav I know what you're saying. Just the preferred thing on a moral level is SCOTUS hands this to Trump.
1331021774327308288 2020-11-24 07:48:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @moonmusicblues @SelimSeesYou Because the legal fight continues?
1331021587592720388 2020-11-24 07:47:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright @theeternalright @inteldotwav Perhaps, but keep our powder dry until SCOTUS removes all constitutional legal process from the equation.
1331020635917725698 2020-11-24 07:43:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NewAmer93831160 @MosleyGang Not clear. She doesn't have to have Trump clear her and GSA head isn't exactly a coveted position among politicos.
1331020130265026562 2020-11-24 07:41:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jamesdkclark NGL, a little bit, but my position is clear: I'm behind Trump until he concedes. Even then, I'm still behind him, just in a different way.
1331018227191787520 2020-11-24 07:34:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RadicalLib What if I told you I was disappointed Trump wasn't that based?
1331017985046220809 2020-11-24 07:33:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CMayyne I mean, no, because nothing about this election season is standard.
1331016322902265857 2020-11-24 07:26:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MosleyGang Yeah, it basically means I don't think we will be seeing Rubicon Don, which is the real best possible result in many ways.
1331016032002174982 2020-11-24 07:25:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DKaiserjager Look, it's concerning, but we have to continue to back the President until he has conceded.
1331015772156682242 2020-11-24 07:24:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> That is all the more reason WE have to continue to support him.
1331015128872054784 2020-11-24 07:21:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MosleyGang The "I believe" part kind of gets me, but still, he has not conceded.
1331014896830582785 2020-11-24 07:20:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheEorlkonig He hasn't conceded.
1331014142887669760 2020-11-24 07:17:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ProjektM0gul @SelimSeesYou As can be seen, it's not actually on behalf of Trump.
1331013097885143041 2020-11-24 07:13:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan That's not a legal argument.
1331012416746950656 2020-11-24 07:11:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan I mean, as long as Trump doesn't concede, who cares?
1331011329403080706 2020-11-24 07:06:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL Agreed. And Trump has all the legitimacy with the Presidency to just end this charade.
1331009470755954688 2020-11-24 06:59:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roland_Gunn2 We've built each other up into a frenzy staying inside with our families. Now we're all nuts and we have to purge it Thunderdome style.
1331008079316578307 2020-11-24 06:53:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan You can taste the fact humans aren't supposed to consume the contents.
1331007605339254785 2020-11-24 06:51:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I blame the people who insist diet soda tastes just as good as regular soda for the fact they are trying convince us bugs are good food. If you must drink soda, drink it in all of its sugary, natural glory.
1331007182121394176 2020-11-24 06:50:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RoyalistW I once had the misfortune of driving through Charleston art night. Yeah, not a place to be.
1331004542956294147 2020-11-24 06:39:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RegReformedGuys Used to be more distinguishable, but most postmillennialism now is just an optimistic form of amillennialism.
1331001927195357184 2020-11-24 06:29:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MosleyGang @DarrenJBeattie Last I heard Ducey is doing everything he can to delay certification while Kelli Ward (state GOP chair) is doing her best to actually audit Maricopa County.
1331001684781391877 2020-11-24 06:28:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DarrenJBeattie Still in contest as far as I'm aware.
1331000625312698375 2020-11-24 06:24:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All these covid restrictions are doing is giving us further reason to not give Biden the Presidency under any circumstances.
1330999618851704835 2020-11-24 06:20:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> LOL, in actual Michigan law you don't even need proof of fraud to request a recount on those grounds.
1330997856795291654 2020-11-24 06:13:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Fact check: True.
1330997757499346948 2020-11-24 06:12:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL @thevivafrei @kasie Elections have been overturned when a large enough irregularity is found like this. One or two bad votes here and there won't do it, but if you find that thousands of votes are just bad, the whole thing becomes tainted.
1330996481176825856 2020-11-24 06:07:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BretagnePoint We have to stand united right now. The system is cracking under its own weight right now. Either the Supreme Court will step in and restore some faith in it or it will refuse and then it's actually really dangerous for them.
1330996141194874880 2020-11-24 06:06:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Peaches_Sabrina @OVonReuenthal Getting all six contest states to fold would be a double hat trick.
1330995891751292937 2020-11-24 06:05:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon Issue an order calling out the unorganized militia to take charge of the streets. Trump supporters will control the whole country soon enough.
1330995293677121537 2020-11-24 06:03:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @billsretpal This Wisconsin recount is going really well. Tens of thousands of ballot challenges.  Also, the army is still in the field and the commander hasn't ordered any surrender.
1330994820987445251 2020-11-24 06:01:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal I hope this all ends up in the Supreme Court for the Case to End All Cases.
1330993366411173897 2020-11-24 05:55:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "One of our legions is suffering, time for whole army to crack."  Half of the Trump Twitterverse every time an election dispute doesn't go our way.
1330991014199357442 2020-11-24 05:46:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAFoshee @LifeNewsHQ That's the argument of the people who voted yes: They have no discretion. Seems dumb to me.
1330990631204900867 2020-11-24 05:44:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAFoshee @LifeNewsHQ I think he tried and they wouldn’t let him.
1330986577431031814 2020-11-24 05:28:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> TO COURT
1330986519516098562 2020-11-24 05:28:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal WEAK. TO COURT
1330986360384221186 2020-11-24 05:27:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad I once worked with this chick who would basically only eat bread and extremely plain meat. She looked extremely unhealthy.
1330984760567541762 2020-11-24 05:21:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Yeoman360 @onewalleee They will, but this is about finding them.
1330974512301666304 2020-11-24 04:40:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou And this wasn't just in Philly where you'd expect some vote dumps to be heavily Biden like that. It was also in places like Montgomery, Erie, and Allegheny where, while they lean left, they aren't dictator margins.
1330974276254650369 2020-11-24 04:39:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou Well, the 110K vote lead needs to be taken in the context of Trump getting 205K more votes in the state overall.   For PA, he was 2.7 million to Biden's 2 at one point. That was when you started getting these crazy 95+% Biden vote dumps in these key counties. 1/2
1330973305482907649 2020-11-24 04:35:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou I think some people do have the PA precinct data now. Yeah, a lot of suspect stuff that came out of a particular Montgomery County middle of the night vote dump based on the precinct data from this vote dump.
1330972940914057217 2020-11-24 04:34:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal More of the same "you're a racist for even questioning the results" I'm guessing.
1330972459865153536 2020-11-24 04:32:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Peaches_Sabrina @OVonReuenthal Internal Michigan Constitution doesn't really and that's what's relevant for Michigan electors.
1330971889779535886 2020-11-24 04:30:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Every Democrat argument boils down to "my opponent is an evil racist scumbag for even daring to question my opinions."
1330971700348022784 2020-11-24 04:29:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal @Peaches_Sabrina Either that, or this hearing is about giving him a counter-argument. We will see. Him voting not to certify would make this contest much easier and we'd get into true constitutional crisis territory.
1330971476510584841 2020-11-24 04:28:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou Yeah, I just don't get where these extra Biden voters came from in many of these counties. Erie in particular finding an extra 10K Biden votes over Hillary is massively suspect.
1330970935495626755 2020-11-24 04:26:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Peaches_Sabrina @OVonReuenthal The main argument to certify is that they don't have any authority not to. I think the GOP member that says he buys this argument will probably end up making a statement that he thinks the whole thing was a sham if he does end up voting that way.
1330969953474916353 2020-11-24 04:22:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Agreed. If I ever move back to California, I'd move to SoCal even though I'm from the Bay. It feels more like the California I grew up in when I visit. Also warmer, nice bonus.
1330969669390438401 2020-11-24 04:21:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is the "law" now.
1330969583306600448 2020-11-24 04:20:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal Watch him pull a Toobin.
1330969233631670272 2020-11-24 04:19:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume *country
1330969127498952704 2020-11-24 04:19:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume It's Metro vs. County. Houston is an American city. Los Angeles is a mix of American and global city. Global cities with internationalist pretensions are the core of the problem. Education is related to this, but part of it is cultural attitude.
1330968511393488898 2020-11-24 04:16:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All I care about at this point is defending our people. We cannot allow these threats, etc. to go unpunished and it's Trump's duty to stop them by hook or by crook.
1330968071725588483 2020-11-24 04:14:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal We need to defend our people. That's what this is about at this point.
1330967287386542083 2020-11-24 04:11:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GladstonianLib @realikamusume Boomers didn't have the cheap access to credit we have and they've paid off their mortgages for the most part.
1330967063494619136 2020-11-24 04:10:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal Watch them convince the flagging GOP guy to vote no because their sheer incompetence.
1330966673818529792 2020-11-24 04:09:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal @theeternalright Some of that stuff is just gut instinct. "Would you trust this person?" "Nah."
1330966200030031874 2020-11-24 04:07:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @GladstonianLib You can't inherit debts unless the debt was owed on tangible property you inherited (like a mortgage). Even then you don't really inherit them. Most of my student loans actually disappeared when my father passed as he was the one who took them out.
1330965586575306760 2020-11-24 04:04:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theeternalright @OVonReuenthal Saying there were without numbers just sounds like you either don't really know if there were or you're hiding how many there were.
1330965349408378890 2020-11-24 04:04:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal These Democrat County Clerks are either uniformly incompetent or uniformly corrupt. Obfuscating the truth constantly.
1330964099237371906 2020-11-24 03:59:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal Let's get something good.
1330963521874649094 2020-11-24 03:56:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal Also, they stuffed the box in 2016 too. They do it every year. It's just a way of life in these big city Democrat machine counties. They do it even when they don't have to so that they can get away with it when they do.
1330963081137152006 2020-11-24 03:55:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal Just saw the legal argument they are compelled to certify after looking this up: Yeah, it's thin. I'd bet on him voting to certify, but wants this shit show on record for the later contest.
1330962473466343426 2020-11-24 03:52:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles I never followed. Someone RT'd.
1330962360106962947 2020-11-24 03:52:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Didn't they move right this election, at least according to exit polls? *grain of salt*
1330960767210885120 2020-11-24 03:45:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Breaking? They released this on Saturday night.
1330960589984817152 2020-11-24 03:45:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal Watch us get a Senate rerun out of this too.
1330958852548911105 2020-11-24 03:38:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Still the best in the business as far as I'm aware and more powerful than ever. Don't shoot you these days, but I almost think the surveillance is worse in the creepy 1984 sort of way.
1330958400604299266 2020-11-24 03:36:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LFighter1776 @goldielee1012 @OVonReuenthal @realikamusume I can only hope you're right.
1330956436105555973 2020-11-24 03:28:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @goldielee1012 @OVonReuenthal @realikamusume Yeah, this seems pretty important. I imagine a witness not showing would look bad for the side that would call them to the stand.
1330955452016975875 2020-11-24 03:24:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal Was it a pro-Biden witness or a pro-Trump one?
1330955248094097410 2020-11-24 03:23:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 @davidchapman141 Yes.
1330953028137062403 2020-11-24 03:15:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Ann can never keep her story straight. She's just mad whenever someone disagrees with her for a moment. Even if she later changes her mind, she doesn't forget you disagreed. Her fanatical Romney loyalism is kind of why she was on the outs in 2015.
1330952650863620097 2020-11-24 03:13:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Cuccinelli is literally just because of that dumb moment at the convention. Otherwise, he has been solid for most of his career, if a bit pompous. She pretends to want Trumpism without Trump, but then condemns Cuccinelli for a moment of insufficient Trump loyalism. Emotionalism.
1330951952491032577 2020-11-24 03:10:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal I can't listen: Someone was saying that it sounds like one of the GOP members sounds determined to vote "yes." Is that true?
1330950794296897540 2020-11-24 03:06:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Her Romney support was what told me she didn't have good discernment back in the day. She backed him because he made some mostly meaningless noise about illegals as Governor of Massachusetts during the final year of his term. Media hyped it. Just extremely gullible.
1330949404682047488 2020-11-24 03:00:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheThirdEpoch @JayFiveK Was the first speaker a Republican or Democrat? If it's a Democrat, it's irrelevant and just throw it out.
1330949260557381636 2020-11-24 03:00:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @TheThirdEpoch @JayFiveK I doubt the law actually says that. Until someone comes up with something else, I think it's probably a misinterpretation of the word "shall."
1330948879999791104 2020-11-24 02:58:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 That is actually the legal process in some states: Certify the count, then file a contest. Doesn't mean there's no recourse.
1330948728446967808 2020-11-24 02:57:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 I'd think such a law would be unconstitutional.
1330948363186003973 2020-11-24 02:56:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheThirdEpoch @JayFiveK What's the statute?
1330948312632012803 2020-11-24 02:56:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> From where does the supposed obligation of the Michigan Board of Canvassers to vote "yes" come from? Can anyone point to this in the law? Seems utterly pointless to have a bipartisan board of canvassers if they can't canvass and investigate.
1330947970158747653 2020-11-24 02:54:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheThirdEpoch @JayFiveK From whence does this supposed legal obligation derive, btw?
1330947812398411777 2020-11-24 02:54:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheThirdEpoch @JayFiveK I'm hearing one might and the other seems solid no. There is literally zero point to this charade if they can't investigate fraud claims.
1330947072313454594 2020-11-24 02:51:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @TheThirdEpoch What's the point of voting if they can't choose one of the options? That's just dumb.
1330946319964311553 2020-11-24 02:48:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I love the smell of Constitutional Crisis in the early afternoon.
1330945657499242496 2020-11-24 02:45:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Don't get me wrong, I like Newt and probably would have voted for him in 2012 had he been on the ballot in my state.
1330945411390054402 2020-11-24 02:44:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Well, considering another was convinced of being a pedo, one was known for crying a lot, and the other is Paul Ryan, yes.
1330944721825501188 2020-11-24 02:42:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm totally ok with arranging a deal with the Arabs and Israelis where they bomb Iran whenever they feel like it, they pay us for weapons, and then we profit from our almond, pistachio, and oil industries.
1330944048673288193 2020-11-24 02:39:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cav_is_boring I think you have the ratio reversed, but basically.
1330943005457600517 2020-11-24 02:35:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cav_is_boring Considering the makeup of the KKK, yes.
1330941791261110276 2020-11-24 02:30:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rural_Respecter @insanerap1st @SelimSeesYou Just done with these people. Willfully ignorant obscurantists at this point.
1330941301538353154 2020-11-24 02:28:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rural_Respecter @insanerap1st @SelimSeesYou Then we have the 9 witnesses between Cobb and Fulton County that purport to seeing these batches of pristine Biden-only "absentee" votes that weren't even folded and looked like they had just been flat printed. That's a slam dunk in my mind.
1330939073066889217 2020-11-24 02:19:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @El_Black_Prince I don't know how this guy keeps making appearances.
1330938828782260224 2020-11-24 02:18:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Does anyone even really care about the Biden cabinet?

1330937225006166017 2020-11-24 02:12:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 Yes.
1330936602483372034 2020-11-24 02:09:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KarnatakaYankee @SelimSeesYou Trump can still contest if they certify. Just becomes a bit harder. GOP controls Michigan Supreme Court through January.
1330936588369616896 2020-11-24 02:09:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Yes.

1330935485611565060 2020-11-24 02:05:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad Oregon has been doing this since 1994, Washington 2006, and Utah did it a few cycles ago (not very long).
1330935303570403331 2020-11-24 02:04:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad Yes. Everyone gets one.
1330935235966627844 2020-11-24 02:04:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @SelimSeesYou As far as I know, Ducey is trying to delay cert as long as possible.
1330933970834497537 2020-11-24 01:59:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Michigan Speaker said a constitutional crisis could prompt them to send Trump electors. We are approaching that point right now if you can’t already call it that.
1330932599758401536 2020-11-24 01:53:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad We have two states that have done all mail in for a long time and neither of them reach these participation rates on the regular. Certainly not the Pennsylvania compulsory voting rate we are seeing.
1330931604282347536 2020-11-24 01:49:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Tom Cotton wins the Internet for today.
1330930611574493184 2020-11-24 01:45:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @insanerap1st @SelimSeesYou I remarked after the election: A mistake the Trump supporters made that allowed the fraud engine to pump out in overdrive mode was voting early in the day on Election Day. Traditionally, Republicans vote between 4 and poll closing so it's difficult to predict how many will show.
1330929188430360576 2020-11-24 01:40:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @insanerap1st @SelimSeesYou I'd believe the turnout numbers if it weren't for the relatively poor turnout in the rust belt in early voting, particularly the big city centers that are the engine of this.
1330928480729624582 2020-11-24 01:37:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou "Yeah, it's totally not suspicious we have highest turnout rate since 1900 despite extremely low interest among our youth population."
1330927340742963201 2020-11-24 01:33:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Why does every world leader look like they're broadcasting from a bunker and being filmed by a high school media team?
1330926241172639744 2020-11-24 01:28:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim Even if you think it's true, pay it no mind. Consider the source.
1330926016710238209 2020-11-24 01:27:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I am certainly happy I purchased level 4 plate armor last month.

1330920725830656002 2020-11-24 01:06:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Pick your battles and try not to do much out of raw spite.

The party is just better than it used to be. I don’t think Georgia Senate is the right battle to pick. Threaten primaries later, not throw solid to solidish votes against Amnesty cloture out.
1330918507257749506 2020-11-24 00:57:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @GladstonianLib @SelimSeesYou Threatening to throw out a solid immigration hawk like Perdue over Raffensperger’s dumb actions is cutting off your nose to spite your face. Do whatever you want with Loeffler, but not Perdue.
1330915976649564163 2020-11-24 00:47:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Anglo_Imperium I obviously have my disagreement with how the United States came to be as a political entity, but I also can't stand cringe anti-Americanism.
1330915781811580932 2020-11-24 00:47:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Seems almost likely that will get stalled out. I think all 6 contested states have a possibility of getting stalled beyond Dec. 8th. Least likely seems Michigan to me, so if that's looking good, better shot at the others.
1330914846041382917 2020-11-24 00:43:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon It does complicate things to some extent: A Christian should use their best judgment as to who (or what) to vote for. My main point is that our allegiance doesn't belong to some abstract entity like "the law" or something, it belongs primarily to the person.
1330912783303634944 2020-11-24 00:35:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheThirdEpoch @SelimSeesYou Comfy mode.

1330911314449993728 2020-11-24 00:29:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Pozzidonius1 @SelimSeesYou Desperate to "cure" ballots.   Allegheny is almost as bad. Trump probably should have gotten 42% there. Scranton, Montgomery, and Erie, possibly Northampton are the hot spots of fraud in Pennsylvania.
1330909512711229442 2020-11-24 00:22:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This can get complicated when there are multiple heads of state to which you owe allegiance. This happens in federal and feudal systems.
1330909222956052481 2020-11-24 00:21:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> My opinion is that Romans 13 and "Render unto Caesar" apply primarily to the person of the head of state. The rest of my political thinking as far as structure goes flows from this.

1330907832561045504 2020-11-24 00:15:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark If what we get out of Trump is a delegitimization of American democratic institutions, then it's better than I thought we'd get quite frankly.
1330906569698123777 2020-11-24 00:10:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Has Trump conceded? No? Then neither have I. Standing back and standing by.

Probably why we only get random acts of individual terrorism now. Coordinated plots just don't have the momentum anymore because you can't find the volunteers to subject themselves to this.

1330900441685700613 2020-11-23 23:46:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 We did have grassroots. I personally helped take control of a local GOP in a county of about 400K people. It just turned into a shit show the moment Ron Paul wasn’t there to bring the different groups together.

1330899506892824580 2020-11-23 23:42:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Perdue sponsored the RAISE Act. Throwing him under the bus because of Raffensperger is just dumb.
1330899170513793024 2020-11-23 23:41:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Anton56422519 That makes sense.
1330899112632475650 2020-11-23 23:40:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There are 9 witnesses to perfectly printed Biden ballots in Fulton and Cobb.

1330898071765606405 2020-11-23 23:36:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Imagine not showing up for a sponsor of the RAISE Act because you’re angry someone else in his party isn’t doing enough for Trump.
1330897917083848706 2020-11-23 23:36:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer I didn’t even know Perdue was that good.

1330893692366884865 2020-11-23 23:19:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BibMccafferty @ProudColonizer McConnell himself is on record as opposing the Gang of 8 bill. The party has only gotten more hardline on the immigration issue since then. With a majority in the Senate McConnell can prevent the use of the nuclear option and likely whip 41 Senators to oppose amnesty.

1330892190244016129 2020-11-23 23:13:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BibMccafferty @ProudColonizer It is left wing legislation regardless of the partisan affiliation or purported ideology of its supporters. Regardless, it’s the only alternative we have if Trump doesn’t get back in and he doesn’t activated Top Secret Plan B.

If this doesn't work out the way we all hope, a GOP majority in the Senate is the best method of preventing amnesty and an AWB. Obvious, this is Plan C if top secret Plan B turns out to be LARPing, but I'm not giving up the country for spite.
1330889075017068545 2020-11-23 23:00:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Please note, this is Plan C. Plan B, as we all know, is top secret.
1330887388781023232 2020-11-23 22:54:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I obviously get the frustration with the Republicans, but we can and have more easily pressured Republicans into rejecting left-wing legislation like amnesty more often than we have Democrats.
1330886700315402245 2020-11-23 22:51:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WwiiiZoomer Better than just letting the Democrats do it. This is what is known as "cutting off your nose to spite your face."
1330886140782632969 2020-11-23 22:49:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @T51BC It's literally the only option: If Trump doesn't get four more years, the only thing between you and stuff like assault weapons bans and mass amnesty is a GOP Senate majority.
1330886016794759171 2020-11-23 22:48:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WwiiiZoomer If Trump doesn't get four more years, the only thing between you and stuff like assault weapons bans and mass amnesty is a GOP Senate majority.
1330771308502781952 2020-11-23 15:12:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar Our side likes to look smart by throwing their own under the bus at the first opportunity.
1330770469193134082 2020-11-23 15:09:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The fascist libertarian President lol.
1330766404191219712 2020-11-23 14:53:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan I don’t get why some conservatives think they can just turn the clock back on this. In many ways, the Rubicon has already been crossed. The die is already cast. We’re just already at the point we believe such different things that a house divided cannot stand.
1330764495107584000 2020-11-23 14:45:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Cancel culture just seems to be an inevitable part of narrative divergence and polarization. It's not really new. People have been doing this to each other during periods of heightened tension for thousands of years.
1330758436481609728 2020-11-23 14:21:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tonybalogna How is that comment even real? LOL.
1330754952747159552 2020-11-23 14:07:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheRoguePrince1 As someone who liked Sessions, this stings, but it is true. Sessions was a bad AG on multiple levels when he should have been the best Trump cabinet member. Rex Tillerson was a worse hire on some levels, though.
1330754589767950337 2020-11-23 14:06:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Pozzidonius1 @SelimSeesYou Is there a single large county in the whole country he didn't get more votes in? I haven't seen one.
1330752949224697857 2020-11-23 14:00:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @YvesDeBeloeil @SelimSeesYou The loyalists in the Trump Admin, besides Mike Flynn and a few others, were total amateur hour, you're right.
1330752427193229312 2020-11-23 13:57:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Truth_Reaction Jared and Ivanka are personally well-meaning towards Trump. I'm talking about conniving snakes like Paul Ryan, Rex Tillerson even being allowed in the admin, not protecting Mike Flynn, etc.
1330752115053109248 2020-11-23 13:56:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IgnatiusR99 Main enemy he should have quashed was Paul Ryan. Mark Meadows wanted to get rid of him and had a plan to do so, but Trump overrode it in a spirit of generosity.
1330751306877853696 2020-11-23 13:53:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> My one point of criticism for Trump: Trump tried to be magnanimous with his enemies early in his Administration because he thought he won the war when he won the election. He had merely won the equivalent of his Battle of First Manassas.
1330750481610776577 2020-11-23 13:50:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @YvesDeBeloeil @SelimSeesYou That really is the truth. The Federal Government is a massive beast and it really just takes more than four years to get it under control as an outsider. You also need an iron will. Trump made the early mistake of attempting magnanimity before he had won the war.
1330748843286286338 2020-11-23 13:43:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @YvesDeBeloeil @SelimSeesYou Nixon didn't have to deal with a hostile Pentagon and Intel Community.
1330748162735214596 2020-11-23 13:41:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 @SelimSeesYou Yeah, just looking at the numbers, a lot of the non-participants that people talk about are probably completely disinterested in politics. There is literally nothing you could do to get them to vote short of straight bribery.
1330747686090403841 2020-11-23 13:39:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou He used this rhetoric more on the trail. Probably could have done it on Twitter, though, that is a bigger audience.
1330746649010954244 2020-11-23 13:34:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @YvesDeBeloeil @SelimSeesYou So they showed up in record numbers for a guy who actively supported the rioters' cause? This narrative makes even less sense than the standard "Orange Hitler" meme. I live in a metro suburb and know not a single person who voted for Biden for this reason.
1330744652450902020 2020-11-23 13:27:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @YvesDeBeloeil @SelimSeesYou His entire message is directed against their class interest itself. The metro suburbanite making six figures or more is the person who benefits from cheap labor overseas and open borders.
1330744440059793408 2020-11-23 13:26:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @YvesDeBeloeil @SelimSeesYou What exactly could he do, though? He already got rid of that dumb Obama era regulation that was going to bring the projects to your suburb. He cut their taxes for the most part. They were getting raises if they were near middle income. What exactly was he supposed to offer?
1330743259283529729 2020-11-23 13:21:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou They went overboard on it to the expense of other issues. Should have been sold as "here's how our economic nationalism will help urban communities" and then moved on.   Not sure if there's any rhetoric to get these metro suburbs back to being more even, though.
1330742197038313473 2020-11-23 13:17:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @17cShyteposter @PereGrimmer I was lamenting this the other day: I'd really prefer it if we still lived in a rational environment where you could have reasoned debate about ideas, but we're just beyond that point. Yes, this leads to unchecked quackery, but that's just life.
1330740133142867970 2020-11-23 13:09:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DKaiserjager Someone will emerge.
1330739749863165959 2020-11-23 13:07:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden I'd support it.
1330738894367764482 2020-11-23 13:04:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DKaiserjager I just think this is partially a natural human tendency. That doesn’t mean another leader can’t emerge organically, but the smoothest transitions tend to take place when everyone knows who the next guy is.
1330738267747127296 2020-11-23 13:01:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dear diary,
1330737901022433280 2020-11-23 13:00:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Fascism is college girls supporting your local police department.
1330736848491175938 2020-11-23 12:56:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This isn’t how movements work organically. See how fast the libertarian/constitutionalist movement became cringe after Ron Paul left no real heir. Trump must select his heir to carry on his legacy.
1330731409686794240 2020-11-23 12:34:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @WickedTewi Congressional contestation and potential SCOTUS rulings are possible.
1330729995883438080 2020-11-23 12:28:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheEorlkonig @HansMahncke @Barnes_Law I mean, this always seemed to be what was going on to me anyway. It is two separate things.
1330728379138658305 2020-11-23 12:22:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal I could see him declaring himself an "Independent" and caucusing Republican for the sake of discipline. Clear his priorities aren't in line with Schumer's.
1330727995896717313 2020-11-23 12:20:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheEorlkonig @HansMahncke @Barnes_Law I think her work is useful from the public angle. Showing even the potential for these machines to be used to significantly tamper with votes shows how vulnerable our elections systems are. Other English-speaking democracies simply do not use these things.
1330726467634929665 2020-11-23 12:14:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal Manchin be like "dude, I won't be able to live in my state if I vote for that."
1330725984681811968 2020-11-23 12:12:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Defending yourself from potential killers is actually pro-life. Executing murderers is also the pro-life position.
1330725016506425345 2020-11-23 12:09:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan I think by then we will have reclassified the Plans. Plan D is pray they don't pack the courts and our SCOTUS majority saves us from anything too crazy while we plan for 2024.
1330724335837999107 2020-11-23 12:06:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheEorlkonig @HansMahncke @Barnes_Law They should stay in their lane and drill down on the hard stuff then and let other people pursue their angles. The right wastes far too much energy refuting each other.
1330723757875482624 2020-11-23 12:04:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheEorlkonig It seems that’s what the team has been doing. The allegation they have been focused on Powell’s angle to the detriment of others is just that: An allegation. This is just clarifying that Powell is doing her own thing. Look at the presser: Giuliani went over the hard cases.
1330722217001410562 2020-11-23 11:57:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheEorlkonig Leave no stone unturned.
1330720572674887680 2020-11-23 11:51:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheEorlkonig It's indicative they're still on good terms.
1330720419855347713 2020-11-23 11:50:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Doomgroyp The main reason I'm reluctant to be completely skeptical of her angle is this: I'm not sure what exactly she gets out of it besides a short term cash infusion from donors that I imagine could results in a lawsuit.
1330717335120973824 2020-11-23 11:38:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Jenna Ellis is still on Team Powell it seems. Head spinning.
1330716585565298689 2020-11-23 11:35:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thevivafrei Trust the plan is the attitude a soldier should have in war and that’s basically what’s going on in a metaphorical sense at least.
1330716027987124224 2020-11-23 11:33:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If she files this lawsuit and it turns out to be totally baseless, she could easily be disbarred in our political climate.
1330715458299891716 2020-11-23 11:31:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Barnes should stay in his lane and do his own thing. His thoughts on Powell‘s evidence or lack thereof shouldn’t be his focus. It’s enough to state your skepticism and move on.
1330715122592002049 2020-11-23 11:29:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou  https://t.co/BLSLL56KrF
1330707603068948481 2020-11-23 10:59:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Gallow_Glass @ScottMGreer That looks like some weird commie shit.
1330704451699683328 2020-11-23 10:47:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Pozzidonius1 Wait, that’s what happened?
1330704283935903747 2020-11-23 10:46:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’d really enjoy it if people on our team didn’t make themselves feel more intelligent and better than others by throwing people under the bus and feasting on corpses like buzzards on roadkill.
1330694853622181890 2020-11-23 10:09:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK In the meantime, I think charging headlong into enemy machine gun nests is ill advised.
1330692244823625728 2020-11-23 09:58:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK It’s almost like this is why I voted for him back in the 2016 primaries.
1330688917163618306 2020-11-23 09:45:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Ohio was a much more Republican-leaning state at the time. People are claiming it is now too, but the evidence for that is voting for Trump by 8% twice. It isn’t demographic or attitudinal.
1330688423892561920 2020-11-23 09:43:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PurpleBaptist @SelimSeesYou FDR only lost Ohio in 1944 and he lost it by .36%.
1330686526506872833 2020-11-23 09:36:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roland_Gunn2 That’s my thinking. She has no reason to do this unless we come to find out she’s in dire financial straights or something personally. I just doubt that.
1330683762385055745 2020-11-23 09:25:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Metropolitan libs who hate the concept of the nation-state itself calling other people “traitors” for mere policy disagreement is among the most hypocritical developments of the Trump era.
1330682248090296326 2020-11-23 09:19:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 Or at least confirmed that he will be.
1330680876628398080 2020-11-23 09:13:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Even a normiecon Evangelical Steve Deace is getting that political power comes from the power of will more than anything. This is starting to remind me of the phrase that you go bankrupt “first slowly, then suddenly.”
1330679743910453250 2020-11-23 09:09:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Imagine actually taking the time to hear shitlib arguments at this point unless you were paid to do so.
1330679456885858304 2020-11-23 09:08:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MosleyGang My main concern with Rubicon Don is apparently our legions might break at the first sign of trouble lol.
1330676188046561280 2020-11-23 08:55:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton It was, technically. So, yes, it is kind of a nothingburger in terms of facts on the ground. Circumstantial at best. Coming from mostly the same people that tell you there’s “no evidence” of voter fraud of course.
1330675635765833731 2020-11-23 08:52:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton The campaign released a statement saying that she is an independent attorney and not on the formal legal team. Most people seem to assume this means they think she’s FoS. No one actually knows that, though.
1330675341866766338 2020-11-23 08:51:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realDharmapala Seriously, everything else is just gravy.
1330673125395140618 2020-11-23 08:42:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @lambeth981 We don’t know why they’re distancing is the thing. It would make sense if this is about keeping the cases separate so judges do not associate the two different cases being made here. The lesser fraud claims with more solid witness evidence are enough to throw out the results.
1330672350594027521 2020-11-23 08:39:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GenFlynn @SidneyPowell1 Thank you General. We stand behind all patriots in these difficult times. No rock should be left unturned!
1330670053994491904 2020-11-23 08:30:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Here is my opinion: Use your best judgment as to who to believe and why and what to focus on. We’re really just novice foot soldiers here doing some amateur sleuthing and sending our links to spread the word and keep spirits high. Truth matters, but we won’t know it for a while.
1330668913244434435 2020-11-23 08:26:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 Nothing in particular. Just that it seems weird only 8 write in votes were recorded in a state with over 17 million votes.
1330668390755741696 2020-11-23 08:24:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sadpianonoises @SelimSeesYou Obviously, she was at the presser. She might still be semi-officially a part of the team.
1330668084898754561 2020-11-23 08:22:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @virginiabelle76 That is what his legal team should focus on, that doesn’t preclude Powell’s statements from being correct and the statement doesn’t imply that either.
1330666454727991305 2020-11-23 08:16:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal Most of them want to issue the most restrictive ruling possible. They don’t want to deal with some grand theory when workaday law will do. This applies across the board.
1330665614126542859 2020-11-23 08:12:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal Yeah, don’t want to prejudice the judiciary with fantastical claims.
1330665429979848705 2020-11-23 08:12:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Yes, Trump is totally telling people “look, I know I’m nuts, but this lady is even more nuts.” Sure, right. Lol.
1330665138941292547 2020-11-23 08:11:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim The “even for him” give it away lol.
1330661255766552577 2020-11-23 07:55:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 Yeah, people are making a mountain out of a molehole quite frankly.
1330660788072222722 2020-11-23 07:53:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 At this point I believe so. Certainly acts that way. Constantly bitching about stuff. Finally put him on block.
1330660573281914880 2020-11-23 07:52:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I see literal grifters are still out for their pound of flesh for being “proven right” about a potential grifter.
1330659374138843137 2020-11-23 07:48:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal There’s always multiple possible interpretations of single points of data. People get way too caught up in proving their pet theories.
1330658651640631298 2020-11-23 07:45:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MosleyGang @SelimSeesYou Compartmentalization is just good design philosophy.
1330650189963603969 2020-11-23 07:11:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GladstonianLib Yeah, the Trump team’s best legal case is the technicalities. Powell’s effort is more important for a later propaganda win if what she says can be proven.
1330649203077488640 2020-11-23 07:07:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou My statement on the Trump team’s statement:  https://t.co/NwnvW9f9QL
1330648625538625538 2020-11-23 07:05:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GladstonianLib The fact they had her at the presser tells you they thought at the time, at least, her angle was fruitful. That might have changed, but it’s all speculation on our part.
1330647993469440000 2020-11-23 07:02:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad @AmericanRhodie You can get married really quick and then smash.
1330645590322122754 2020-11-23 06:53:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Circumstantial evidence the Powell statement is more about judicial strategy than anything else: Jenna Ellis’s last tweet was about the appeal.
1330644307846586369 2020-11-23 06:48:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CousinGroypley We don’t have much other choice. Our fervent speculations like we know something are just that: speculation.
1330643985472364545 2020-11-23 06:47:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @CransleyPerfume I agree. They may just not want to be associated with her efforts while adjudicating the lesser claims. That makes sense from a strategic perspective. It generally militates towards skepticism about her case.
1330643320637427716 2020-11-23 06:44:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CransleyPerfume Any reason you have is speculation.
1330643105666707457 2020-11-23 06:43:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is just a statement of fact. People out for a pound of flesh after taking statements out of context are cringe.
1330642668855111681 2020-11-23 06:41:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theeternalright @Wizard_Predicts People always looking for a pound of flesh.
1330641383972024320 2020-11-23 06:36:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob Let’s just wait and see what happens at this point, but I obviously agree this doesn’t look good for her case. Trump did share the Dominion report from OAN.
1330635184757235718 2020-11-23 06:12:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy They were. They were instructed to contest every ballot labeled indefinitely confused. There’s 170K of these in Wisconsin with a large percentage in Milwaukee and Dane. Well more than enough for Trump to win.
1330633244237324290 2020-11-23 06:04:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There’s no election fraud!
1330622000100990982 2020-11-23 05:19:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The observers not paying attention are likely the Democrats. That one in front certainly has the physiognomy. Sounds like they are coming up with some ridiculous rules, particularly in Milwaukee, though.
1330618055102246913 2020-11-23 05:04:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Reminder than Ronna Romney McDaniel endorsed Trump before Michigan had voted in the primaries. Might have even been before Super Tuesday.
1330617127376728068 2020-11-23 05:00:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I genuinely like trolling Romney with his niece being a Trump loyalist.
1330616905305124865 2020-11-23 04:59:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates That is plausible, but it’s kind of a chicken and egg question at some point.
1330615963390242819 2020-11-23 04:55:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> For lack of a better term, men who vote Democrat lack any sort of will to power. To be expected of women on some level. Men? Get some testosterone supplements from your doctor.
1330613075402235905 2020-11-23 04:44:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ClassicalTheis He never was anything else.
1330612765258604549 2020-11-23 04:42:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob That’s partially true, but that was a dead cat bounce caused by the patriotic fervor of 9/11. The right has been skeptical of the Feds since the 90s with stuff like Waco and Ruby Ridge. It has worked its war from the hard right to basically any genuine conservative now.
1330612283450531840 2020-11-23 04:41:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @battlethrall Especially with the video cards that just dropped.
1330611849910497283 2020-11-23 04:39:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob Trust in these institutions was already pretty low. What Trump just did is kick down the door.
1330611200355340292 2020-11-23 04:36:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim They’re just flat lying. Their own manual said you could do this.
1330610098977320960 2020-11-23 04:32:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @winogradsky1 @LaurenWitzkeDE Go ahead. We have nothing to hide.
1330608908755320832 2020-11-23 04:27:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jaussie74 @LaurenWitzkeDE They all do, you’re right. Georgia is the most egregious and obviously impacted the result, though.
1330606251592605698 2020-11-23 04:17:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy We will have the final proof the Know Nothings were right.
1330606036248621067 2020-11-23 04:16:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim “It was a glitch!”  I mean, one or two of these and you can accept it, but the number we saw and is being documented through Edison certainly warrants investigation at this point.
1330605205684183046 2020-11-23 04:12:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @agentbizzle Literally had a study last week showing how useless masks are. Keep dehumanizing your own flesh and blood, though.
1330604506145583107 2020-11-23 04:10:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JBFalke I actually am a flag.
1330603858083647493 2020-11-23 04:07:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @agentbizzle Because of the incompetence of doctors treating the disease early on and shoving too many people on ventilators. Keep hiding in your basement like a useless, lazy coward, though.
1330601247188119553 2020-11-23 03:57:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 12 million “have Covid.” Apparently you never recover from this virus. You’re tainted with it forever.
1330589340137893893 2020-11-23 03:09:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Kane9015 I’m not a premill or a futurist, but I’m willing to accept the idea of @HeritageNLegacy at this point that this might be one of many marks of the beast we will struggle with.
1330589104048918531 2020-11-23 03:08:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I don’t get Christians who reflexively dismiss conspiracy theories. Jesus was literally the victim of a conspiracy.
1330587922421190658 2020-11-23 03:04:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton We’re reactionaries. Even though we’re not democrats, we also trust in the common wisdom of the folk.
1330586870854656004 2020-11-23 03:00:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Saw this on the way home from Church this morning.  https://t.co/kl5FySNOCT
1330585409357828102 2020-11-23 02:54:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton This is where you get cringe apologies for Stalin being some kind of cool dude for being authoritarian and somewhat pragmatic. I’m like “he is still a godless communist.”
1330584493405601793 2020-11-23 02:50:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton I don’t know where this whole discovery of traditional authority got sidetracked into belief in the modern nanny state. Too much reactionary postmodernism and not enough just reaction.
1330583865136721920 2020-11-23 02:48:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Indian_Bronson I literally just said I believe this.
1330583439381237763 2020-11-23 02:46:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dissident rightist reflexive bootlicking has nothing to do with genuine traditional authoritarianism.
1330577648045727749 2020-11-23 02:23:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeracleanVision We’re really just waiting for the formal casus belli.
1330577197522939905 2020-11-23 02:21:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DaldorenGaming Agreed. This is a nice formal casus belli, though.
1330576483476267011 2020-11-23 02:18:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal This poll also said half thought the election was stolen. According to Rasmussen, that means a fifth of the people polled are weak sauce.
1330423317346611200 2020-11-22 16:10:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar Link? This sounds fascinating.
1330423124228247554 2020-11-22 16:09:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing Might be. Time will tell.
1330422480167706625 2020-11-22 16:06:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> At least not all the TDS people were psychos about Russia in December of 2016.
1330422214110408709 2020-11-22 16:05:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Whenever progs make these kind of statements, I’d just laugh and go like “yes, please investigate the voter fraud. I’m sure you’ll love what you find.”
1330421129027219463 2020-11-22 16:01:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon And you wonder how real any of the big city turnout is even in a regular year. Like a lot of the people in the cities just don’t care.
1330420106514604034 2020-11-22 15:57:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon People are beginning to wonder if libtards are even real lol.
1330418526100844545 2020-11-22 15:51:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon Everyone’s done with this shit and yet supposedly Biden got 80 million votes on it lmao.
1330416429737381889 2020-11-22 15:42:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The term “oh ye of little faith” is not used enough these days.
1330414449329643525 2020-11-22 15:34:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat *hear
1330414352336351235 2020-11-22 15:34:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat The momentum is building like crazy. Ready to here Rush come on the air and declare Trump should be emperor.
1330412390026981378 2020-11-22 15:26:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat Amend the constitution to make Presidential election disputes the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
1330412113567903745 2020-11-22 15:25:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChiefTrumpster @TrustThePlant Apparently the CIA has rogue elements that you don't hear about that get cracked down on somewhat regularly by other government agencies.
1330411852707278848 2020-11-22 15:24:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChiefTrumpster @TrustThePlant It definitely happened, but there is a dispute about what exactly happened. The initial reporting was that it was a private server. The new information is that special forces seized it from a CIA facility. This actually happens whenever they think the CIA has gone rogue.
1330410834988838913 2020-11-22 15:20:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Expat_Beagle_Oz Human being engages in perfectly normal activity many generations of his ancestors participated in is "bloodlust."
1330409848610107396 2020-11-22 15:16:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RadioactiveRedn In all honesty, I expect this order isn't being enforced; "Persons arriving in California from other states or countries, including returning California residents, should practice self-quarantine for 14 days after arrival."
1330408583293493251 2020-11-22 15:11:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LovebugMAGA Can I be proud of my birth state again?
1330407954957348867 2020-11-22 15:09:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @SirGripz No, but the restrictions on gatherings of any kind are ridiculous. Legit, it's probably my grandmother's last Christmas and she can't travel. Will find a way.
1330407731883335683 2020-11-22 15:08:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing I will enter China under the guise of selling the country out and enter California on the pretense of being successful.
1330407539205402625 2020-11-22 15:07:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirGripz Sounds like a plan.
1330406937414995969 2020-11-22 15:05:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> How does one sneak into California these days? Asking for a friend. He needs to clandestinely see family.
1330406087313543168 2020-11-22 15:01:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot HE REALLY IS VERY GREASY. I SAW IT ONCE IN PERSON.
1330405838834573314 2020-11-22 15:00:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @qidase I think he should do so beforehand. Do not let Biden have the Presidency under any circumstances.
1330405098233749505 2020-11-22 14:57:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob Trump and his team have other means of gaining intelligence outside of the Justice Department or the IC. I know this for sure.
1330404193996320776 2020-11-22 14:54:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Means, motive, opportunity. We got all of these. We have them in spades. We have witnesses to them using some of these means. That's hard evidence. Really the only thing we could want more at this point is a smoking gun on Dominion strategically switching votes.
1330403257886367744 2020-11-22 14:50:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob Would you trust the Justice Department if you’re Trump? I’d posit you’d have to be an idiot to turn evidence of what they’re alleging, even on a small scale, over to the FBI.
1330401476200587266 2020-11-22 14:43:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @qidase @RiddleguyMan These people don't seem to get that the left intends to punish Trump people. There can never be another genuine right wing administration if we allow them to legally harass our people.
1330401061736214528 2020-11-22 14:41:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThracianGroyper I think we will probably form makeshift regiments of roving Trump supporters.
1330400830525239296 2020-11-22 14:40:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThracianGroyper Come join the cause. Will be glorious. Much loot to be had and the women always love a war hero.
1330398392200159232 2020-11-22 14:31:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon Quite frankly I think Trump has the Mandate of Heaven regardless of the judicial outcome simply because his people obviously have more will to power and love for the man than Biden's voters do. Trump can just go like "no" and seize power.
1330396341516836866 2020-11-22 14:23:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan It's smaller in those 3 states. Biden's lead is larger in PA's than Trump's was and Biden's Michigan lead is very healthy as well. Of course, Michigan also has that 100K Biden vote dump that supposedly happened in Wayne County in the middle of the night with 4 eyewitnesses.
1330395541671440385 2020-11-22 14:19:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan "Healthy margins" like Arizona: 10K or so. Georgia: 12K. Wisconsin: 20K. That is 37 electoral votes right there.
1330395158345605120 2020-11-22 14:18:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates We can give each voter some kind of cryptographic ID with their registration that will allow them to vote. Will prevent any possibility of someone voting on your behalf.
1330394528315035648 2020-11-22 14:15:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you don't want hand counted and verified paper ballots with strong chains of custody and observation during the counting process, you're actually an enemy of the country at this point.
1330393634378833927 2020-11-22 14:12:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Hmmm.....  It's all coming together now, isn't it?
1330384805842874371 2020-11-22 13:37:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis @RedEaglePatriot @davidchapman141 @OfficialDavidNC @RealAPolitics @reddvoyager1 If they prove fraud on a massive scale like that, and the courts refuse to even hear it, then I honestly think the republic is done anyway and the proper course of action is to fight and you know what I mean when I say that. Sorry, but the stakes are too high to just concede.
1330383855564582912 2020-11-22 13:33:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis The margins are tight enough in enough states that the lower bars of mass mail in fraud are enough to throw out results.
1330383338981494787 2020-11-22 13:31:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis @RedEaglePatriot @davidchapman141 @OfficialDavidNC @RealAPolitics @reddvoyager1 I don't like giving percentages to events like this because we're really in unprecedented waters right now. I think the chances are better than 5%, though.
1330381134052646916 2020-11-22 13:22:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ciceromt63 @bronzeagemantis The whole country knew what was up when that Philly Republican poll watcher wasn't allowed into that one precinct on election morning.
1330380184156057602 2020-11-22 13:18:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Michael_Voris It's all the same thing. One mass of corruption and deceit.
1330377634426073091 2020-11-22 13:08:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd Also consider in Pennsylvania, they ignored a SCOTUS order directly. Personally, I'd invalidate their election on principle.
1330374078310604802 2020-11-22 12:54:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump won a landslide in 2016 too. Clintonistas were just as fake and gay as Biden bros.
1330373225872756738 2020-11-22 12:51:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @politicalcorr14 You do that by not saying anything.
1330373170365411331 2020-11-22 12:50:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @flatearthhardR Hmm...that makes sense of why I like them, but don't get what all the fuss is about from people who rave about it.
1330367657829429248 2020-11-22 12:29:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Well, we gotta boycott Black Rifle now too.
1330367026699886592 2020-11-22 12:26:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Obama rigged the election for Trump because he hated Hillary.
1330363691657797632 2020-11-22 12:13:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @andrewboonedog I find her writing tedious and her philosophy bad.
1330363093004783616 2020-11-22 12:10:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Someone found the one passage in Ayn Rand that was any good.
1330362778993954818 2020-11-22 12:09:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon Well, I’m in Virginia for the time being. Skedaddling if Biden gets in though. If not, probably will anyway.
1330362129015332866 2020-11-22 12:07:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob He doesn’t even have any qualities that make up for that. At least Bush had endearing mannerisms and Mitt Romney is well put together. Pat Toomey looks like a stooge.
1330361521965297664 2020-11-22 12:04:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon My Washingtonian family is packing up as we speak to go. They’re done with it.
1330358024209387520 2020-11-22 11:50:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 Yes. That’s why I said it. Virginia has no state offices on the ballot this year. No local stuff where this would look weird.
1330357710764838915 2020-11-22 11:49:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It would make sense of the extra votes in Fairfax County that didn’t exist as of 5 PM on Election Day.
1330357445336715264 2020-11-22 11:48:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think this is Virginia if it’s true.
1330356909787013121 2020-11-22 11:46:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @T51BC The task is daunting. All the more why we must not shrink from it.
1330355350428643329 2020-11-22 11:40:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m not really worried about the clock ticking for Team Trump. A lot of people do their best work with a time pressure.
1330355006877421568 2020-11-22 11:38:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> What is going on?
1330352655919669255 2020-11-22 11:29:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 Us IT workers got some sick raises hopping around because of the H1b crackdown.
1330346928148770816 2020-11-22 11:06:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JBrewski12 @EndDemocracy @MisesianChicago @Charlemagne_03 @KapitalistKhan The Tariff of Abominations was just had policy.
1330346531065565185 2020-11-22 11:05:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Charlemagne_03 Trump is head of state. He is the one with the Mandate until he surrenders it. 4 year terms are recommendations. They’re the revolutionaries, not us.
1330344808506925056 2020-11-22 10:58:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago @Charlemagne_03 @JBrewski12 @EndDemocracy @KapitalistKhan How can you not respect a man who beats his wannabe assassin with a cane and walks around with a bullet in him?
1330338640396947457 2020-11-22 10:33:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly Typically it means he thinks your case was not only bad, but brought in bad faith.
1330338389527289861 2020-11-22 10:32:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OfficialDavidNC He needs one other. That would leave Joe with 270. Joe supposedly has 306. PA+GA is 36. 306-36 = 270.
1330337280440098824 2020-11-22 10:28:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dismissal with prejudice is typically the end of the case, but there’s always ways around stuff. The law isn’t so dumb as to let some corrupt judge dismiss cases with prejudice without any recourse. Makes it a pain in the ass, but this was always going to be a pain in the ass.
1330336529806397446 2020-11-22 10:25:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MichelleRE0191 They can always appeal.
1330336254391693313 2020-11-22 10:24:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton The judge did his best to make that a pain in the ass, but to be expected from an Obama appointee.
1330336078738452480 2020-11-22 10:23:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Yes.
1330336011570835456 2020-11-22 10:23:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Why does everything have to be so creepy?
1330334361670053888 2020-11-22 10:16:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 We’re in an information war. Listening to the enemy at all right now is like going personally charging an enemy machine gun nest.
1330333790636568576 2020-11-22 10:14:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RoyalistW Imagine if an army had this kind of morale problem.
1330333197469626370 2020-11-22 10:12:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I can’t believe how many blackpillers there are over one Obama Judge dismissing a case.
1330332230749655048 2020-11-22 10:08:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ClassicalTheis “Their own.” These people have no understanding of what we believe or how we think.
1330331163483910151 2020-11-22 10:04:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @Blair_A_Nathan Neoreactionaries have a point about formalism in government. However you structure your government, it needs to adhere to formal structures and chains of command. Dark people no one knows can’t have real control.
1330330060256129025 2020-11-22 09:59:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LokiJulianus I’m pretty convinced Will glows in the dark.
1330329843033108480 2020-11-22 09:58:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @Blair_A_Nathan It sounds like a good idea until you realize it basically means you have no real control over government and no one can hold these people accountable. They just do whatever they want.
1330329337225240580 2020-11-22 09:56:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy I hate agreeing with you on this, but it is mostly true except for some fringe guys.
1330326581026435073 2020-11-22 09:45:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @Blair_A_Nathan Permanent government works. It’s really an old concept stretching back a long time in political philosophy. Main point is that it’s not some new conspiracy theory lol.

1330304194151129090 2020-11-22 08:16:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep Did it in a way he sounded like he was ripping off Pace Picante too lol.
1330303711869095938 2020-11-22 08:14:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal This was to be expected. This is just about getting the contestations on record.
1330300600790212608 2020-11-22 08:02:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @JayFiveK It’s a problem when you combine the function of the Constitutional Court with the function of workaday law. Many countries separate these functions to a specific court that only handles interpretation of constitutional political questions.
1330299864677298183 2020-11-22 07:59:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume The last time California shifted right in comparison to the rest of the nation was 1972-&gt;1976 when it went from D+5-&gt;R+4. This is a technicality too, it still shifted left in terms of absolute vote. Probably can’t identify a time New York ever did that in the post-New Deal era.
1330298933051056135 2020-11-22 07:55:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @JayFiveK Our courts are so corrupt. *Checks partisan affiliation of judge* *Already knows outcome of decision*
1330298372352331786 2020-11-22 07:53:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LokiJulianus Man hops onto every contrarian bandwagon ever. He’s so contrarian he gets confused about what he’s supposed to be contrarian against.
1330298044231938051 2020-11-22 07:52:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Who appointed the judge?

1330294797404401666 2020-11-22 07:39:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep I once balled my eyes out (alone, like a proper man) after I wrote a theology paper about the Hypostatic Union in John’s Gospel.

1330291532650467333 2020-11-22 07:26:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is gaining steam. Pretty crazy to think about.

She’s not a crank.

1330237280720662535 2020-11-22 03:50:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy I’m not sure where all this even came from. I know of several young Reformed ministers who preach this trash. They should be defrocked and excommunicated.
1330236819368251393 2020-11-22 03:49:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @NationalistTV Uh...the Covenanter’s used the phrase “For Christ’s Crown and Covenant.”   Jesus if King of Kings. That’s the Biblical language.
1330236189920686084 2020-11-22 03:46:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Christians who agree with sentiments like this (and I know of pastors who preach it) are in direct violation of the Fifth Commandment.

1330234276089114625 2020-11-22 03:39:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee How dare he appease his Evangelical base with a mostly meaningless gesture while negotiating lasting peace so we don’t have to have our boys dying anymore.
1330226024278319104 2020-11-22 03:06:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Compulsory voting would have made more sense to enact in the 1990s when participation was at all time record lows.
1330225807483146240 2020-11-22 03:05:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Democrats think this will really benefit them, but it hasn’t helped the Australian or Brazilian left as much as they’d like.   Also, it is bizarre to call for this after what is supposedly the highest turnout election since 1900.
1330221544635846658 2020-11-22 02:48:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad @Reactionaryguy Honestly, just be confident and yourself. It sounds cliche, but if you behave like you will have fun regardless, that shows confidence.
1330221274543648771 2020-11-22 02:47:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SpringToad This is exactly what is going on. It’s why, despite its crassness and base immorality on a certain level, Trump’s “grab them by the p*ssy” line rings true lol. Built guys have a leg up on this due to the fact they just look like they get their by sheer force.
1330218316514930690 2020-11-22 02:35:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad @Reactionaryguy You gotta be aggressive, but not like creepy aggressive. Just act like a guy who gets his way more often than not. I’m honestly terrible at this.
1330217264939929602 2020-11-22 02:31:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BibMccafferty @ProudColonizer I’m not sure about Georgia’s process precisely, but it seems difficult to get new results due to the secret ballot without mass irregularities in particular ballot batches. If systemic irregularities are detected, the results can be declared invalid.
1330216836076613636 2020-11-22 02:29:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark “We need a scientific study to reaffirm what everyone’s instincts told them for untold millennia.
1330215103329939462 2020-11-22 02:22:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Blair_A_Nathan It’s just a term for the unaccountable bureaucracy that actually runs the country as opposed to the political branches which have become Kabuki theater at this point. The Mormons at the CIA seem half competent, though.
1330210340995538944 2020-11-22 02:03:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee @RiddleguyMan Absolutely, keep the pressure on them for sure.
1330209303110807553 2020-11-22 01:59:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DocKilmer Will need to the contestation period to play out. That ends on Tuesday. Team Trump will definitely be filing a contest. First week of December is primetime for legislative involvement.
1330208916798627848 2020-11-22 01:58:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @roytapel @trajan_decius @RiddleguyMan Yeah, most of the minority pandering was actually aimed at keeping the numbers among college Whites down for the Democrats. It sucks because they’re an extremely reliable voting group. They just show up more consistently.
1330207564047507469 2020-11-22 01:52:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DocKilmer Governor signing off on the electors is usually pro forma. He doesn’t really have any authority to not do it. The contestation period is still open.
1330207286619467783 2020-11-22 01:51:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Perhaps, but he was technically the anti-Georgia establishment pick in the runoff. Cagle had the backing of the usual suspects in the Georgia GOP. Obviously, if stuff comes out, all for it. We just need to be more focused than we are. We waste a lot on the wrong targets.
1330206866559934464 2020-11-22 01:50:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 I’m unsure as to Georgia legal specifics, but he likely doesn’t.
1330206745789165571 2020-11-22 01:49:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 These roles are usually written in the State Constitutions themselves. A lot of states specifically prohibit unitary executives. I’m obviously a fan of unitary executives, but it would take a lot to undo them at this point. Whole new state constitutions in most states.
1330206015346892807 2020-11-22 01:46:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Raffensperger is the one who entered into the illegal consent decree and ran a shit show election. Keep your eyes on target. The Governor has minimal authority running an election.

1330202839914860544 2020-11-22 01:34:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Anton56422519 I agree, but I’m just saying there are honest people who do believe the theology.
1330202325588336646 2020-11-22 01:32:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 @KingFrenly It is built into the system at this point. Abolishing it in a vacuum will throw things off.   Also, while I am against arbitrary price controls of most types, I am for strong labor protection laws which the United States utterly lacks. Repealing our only laws would be bad.
1330201122263490573 2020-11-22 01:27:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Anton56422519 Some of the more prominent Israel first, last, and only people like John Hagee it is. Dispensationalism has been around long enough it has a genuine following, though.
1330199919836229637 2020-11-22 01:22:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Filmerian1 @Theo_Chilton It’s a simple fact that Evangelical political theology turned on a dime over the past 10 years. Pre-Obama hardline immigration stances and commitments to European identity were the norm among Protestants.
1330199561227395074 2020-11-22 01:21:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It makes sense of why Evangelical political theology suddenly looked exactly like the type of politics Fortune 500 companies profit from. This wasn’t the case until very recently. Hardline immigration stances are the norm for Protestants historically.
1330198879984361472 2020-11-22 01:18:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton @Filmerian1 I honestly thought this was already documented.
1330197728031363074 2020-11-22 01:13:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It makes legal sense to pursue lesser fraud claims as the Trump Camp has mostly done legally. If they can prove the greater conspiracy claims, that would be a boon to political capital.
1330197332772745223 2020-11-22 01:12:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hakasays @realikamusume California has urban sprawl like no other state in the Union. Literally hundreds of miles of single family homes stretched out. Considering it is home, I didn’t mind if before the foreigners took everything over starting in the early 2000s.

1330188557617688577 2020-11-22 00:37:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad The rejection reason is actually from Eric Erickson, who is against the whole notion of fraud. He argues that the law doesn’t require signature matching.
1330184837890764804 2020-11-22 00:22:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad No, they didn’t. They didn’t reject a single ballot for a mismatched signature. Only no signature at all.

It's documented at this point.
1330050300053516289 2020-11-21 15:27:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @realRonDeSantis @AStratelates @dyn0mutt If the courts won't even let us make our case, that is when things get dangerous. The left has been openly threatening Trump's team personally and us on wider scale with things like "re-education." It's why I said what I said about Rubicon crossing.
1330049620576186370 2020-11-21 15:25:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis @HeritageNLegacy @AStratelates @dyn0mutt You are perhaps right. At this point, I think the irregularities are so well documented that the right will continue to believe it regardless of how it turns out. We might have different theories as the exact means they use, but the fact of the steal is solidified in our minds.

1330046086258548736 2020-11-21 15:11:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 @KingFrenly I just think it's going to cause more harm than good to totally abolish it.
1330045577934082050 2020-11-21 15:09:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @trajan_decius Like, these people who voted just don't vote. We're talking 67% eligible voter turnout, which, as stated, hasn't been seen since 1900. Difficult to believe it actually happened. You need precinct level data and the voter file to actually understand these trends for real.
1330045191936421888 2020-11-21 15:07:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @trajan_decius Yeah, it's difficult to analyze these "results" at this point. Genuine political experts in a normal election analyze the electorate over the course of 18 months. If they get away with it, I want the voter file to see how they did it.
1330044113157320704 2020-11-21 15:03:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trajan_decius @RiddleguyMan People who simply don't think Trump speaks to populist issues enough aren't going to go out to vote for Joe Biden. I mean, man was basically the Senator of the credit card companies.
1330043868931383298 2020-11-21 15:02:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trajan_decius @RiddleguyMan Trump probably could have pushed a bit harder on the populist front. However, given the turnout levels in the rust belt, I'm not sure what good this would have done. We're talking about an election with turnout higher than we've seen in 120 years. Clearly more was at stake.
1330042149023469568 2020-11-21 14:55:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trajan_decius @RiddleguyMan That is probably more realistic, but the political feasibility of this is questionable in my mind. White guys tend to be conservative economically. No way you can get a critical mass of people behind the kind of platform they are suggesting. It ends up alienating everyone.

1330039477780312064 2020-11-21 14:44:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AtlanticAdvo That was the main problem in Trump term 1 that is slowly getting fixed. There just weren’t  enough of us running around Washington in political posts to man an Admin. Now there are, but that will change if people get subject to years of legal harassment.
1330038894688133122 2020-11-21 14:42:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis You certainly have more interaction with the real world. WNs are basically an online only thing. I get why that is on some level, but you can’t be that big of a group if you’re limited to a few small Internet forums.

1330038060629815298 2020-11-21 14:39:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Loosey39671884 Yes I am. You are the idiot who doesn’t know what you’re talking about.
1330037956862746629 2020-11-21 14:38:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Wignat meme 5%: Racist White trolls who voted for Biden.  Actual 5% (according to media polls): Moderate college educated dudes whose girlfriends bitched at them for liking Trump.
1330037351964413952 2020-11-21 14:36:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Loosey39671884 You are wrong on all counts. Whites are 70% of the electorate and Trump cut legal immigration. Also “no political solution” is either a cop out for bitchy posts online or fedposting.
1330036886350548992 2020-11-21 14:34:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates It’s just a lot to bank on if you’re wrong and given the environment of the past 4 years, the idea these guys will just move on is incredibly naive. They tried to frame Michael Flynn while Trump was President for crying out loud.
1330035566910574593 2020-11-21 14:29:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> A lot more is at stake here than the results of one election. What these people promise to do is evil and it should be prevented at all costs because we might not get a second chance.
1330035199669841920 2020-11-21 14:27:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> What is the plan of the people who want to just let Biden have the Presidency? I’m never giving up the fight no matter what happens, but if they start truth and reconciliation committees for ex-Trump officials, who do you expect to man the deck of our next Admin?
1330032946263232515 2020-11-21 14:18:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob @davidchapman141 @SidneyPowell1 What message would these people want that Trump doesn’t already represent and actively accomplished? I mean this man destroyed NAFTA: What more can a WWC person in Michigan ask for while not losing the whole GOP base in the process?
1330032643723956224 2020-11-21 14:17:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob @davidchapman141 @SidneyPowell1 Turnout and margins among that group are likely maxed out at this point. Folks like Girdusky think they can get millions more of these people to the polls and I just don’t think it’s possible. We already saw record breaking turnout this year even in these places.
1330031747103387650 2020-11-21 14:14:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob @davidchapman141 @SidneyPowell1 Michigan is already going to contest anyway. Though, Minnesota’s numbers are ridiculous too.
1330031338821459972 2020-11-21 14:12:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob @davidchapman141 @SidneyPowell1 Parscale was bad: That is universally acknowledged. Blaming Kushner for everything is tiresome at this point. Going after working class Hispanics was a good idea and worked well with Trump’s overall messaging. I’m not really sure how much more juice there is to squeeze among WWC.
1330030049400131586 2020-11-21 14:07:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob @davidchapman141 @SidneyPowell1 I’m pretty sure that’s L. Lin Wood’s case in Georgia, which isn’t actually the President’s. Jared and Parscale aren’t on the legal team.
1330023796787585024 2020-11-21 13:42:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The certifications aren't as final as people think. The process seems all messed up this year, though.   In any case, certification is usually the first point where you can actually dispute the results through legal contests.
1330022984422223873 2020-11-21 13:39:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JakeBalcom @CottoGottfried @DayPolitical I just don't trust technology to be accessible and secure enough. If ain't broke, don't fix it: Secured, chain of custody, observed boxes counted in central locations by precinct are the best we can day. Impervious to fraud? No. But nothing is.
1330019510867406848 2020-11-21 13:25:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried @DayPolitical It's quite clear that even if they weren't used to manipulate this election, they could be used to do so. We will probably be going back to hand counted ballots at central, observed locations at this point.
1330015718260305930 2020-11-21 13:10:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Blair_A_Nathan Oman.
1330014408311967745 2020-11-21 13:05:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou At least we will no longer have to deal with that crook.
1330014117080535040 2020-11-21 13:04:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Likely no signature matching for certain ballots in Maricopa with the right party registration.
1330013259651538946 2020-11-21 13:00:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeftyHaruspex You want to delete the 6 million votes! I've heard this before....
1330012117890703361 2020-11-21 12:56:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I don't think Dominion is going to be getting another contract for voting machines anytime soon.
1330010680074915843 2020-11-21 12:50:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @hatefuldweeb If we had precinct level data, we could perhaps reasonably determine there were certain Democrat heavy precincts that turned out at much higher rates and investigate those. Regardless, Erie turnout is at compulsory voting levels.
1330010347290435584 2020-11-21 12:49:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @hatefuldweeb Edinboro has 6,000 people. Certainly couldn't have up with an extra 10K votes for Biden over 2016. Most of these votes would have to come from Millcreek and Erie itself. We don't have precinct data, so we don't really know where these votes come from. Itself problematic.
1330007179915628545 2020-11-21 12:36:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou We are talking about DMV ladies here lol.
1330006571401797637 2020-11-21 12:34:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @hatefuldweeb Mahoning is home to Youngstown. These are extremely similar counties and historically, Erie leans to the right of Mahoning.
1330006131264131075 2020-11-21 12:32:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Mahoning turnout makes sense: It's up, but with shrinking population, the amount it is up is small. Erie County faces a similar shrinking population and it scrounges up 16K more voters, 6 for Trump and 10 for Biden?
1330005737989419008 2020-11-21 12:30:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Can someone explain to me how Biden got 1,035 votes less than Hillary in Mahoning County, but 10,224 more in Erie County, Pennsylvania?  https://t.co/nSlg0JU8MK  https://t.co/moRXPlXrBa
1330003803412815872 2020-11-21 12:23:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob Consider that in September, Erie County Republicans registered 1500 people and Erie County Democrats registered...15.
1330003622336335872 2020-11-21 12:22:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob Yeah, it was definitely electorally inefficient, but Trump still got a lot more votes in the rust belt and I'm really suspect of the universe where Youngstown flips red for the first time since 1972 and Erie scrounges up an extra 10K Biden votes over Hillary.
1330002433062350854 2020-11-21 12:17:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou In seriousness, I think the reporter was discounting the 100K provisional ballots. That's where the vast majority of the 65K Trump votes come from. The fact the final batch of votes in Allegheny and Philadelphia are like 90% for Biden is kind of ridiculous, though.
1330001940340756482 2020-11-21 12:15:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob In terms of vote gain from 2016, technically Trump gets a disproportionate gain from California as well. He has 1.5 million of his 10 million new votes from there.
1330001588224741376 2020-11-21 12:14:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob It's really difficult to say. A lot of Biden's votes come from California, where there is a reasonable explanation for the higher than normal turnout. Where it doesn't make sense are these dying metro areas in the rust belt that experienced 90+% turnout supposedly.
1330000927454007298 2020-11-21 12:11:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou That second line:  https://t.co/JkXLwCVueS
1330000476633444352 2020-11-21 12:09:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob Like I pointed out earlier, this is going to be the highest turnout election since 1900 in terms of eligible voters. Given who was voting in the early vote, I'm just not sure where these people come from.
1329994885219430400 2020-11-21 11:47:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou It is possible this clerk is particularly lazy with entering birthdays or something (should be automated anyway at this point), but given the corruption of the Democratic machine counties, incompetence seems more like cover for suspicious activity in my mind.
1329994187878649860 2020-11-21 11:44:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The total number is 36K in the county, and the number nationally is 303K.
1329994094895050752 2020-11-21 11:44:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I think some of the fraud was baked in to start. I'm convinced there's something extremely fishy with Milwaukee's voter rolls: 12% of the people the voter file can't determine the age of reside in this county. I suspect most of these people don't exist. (This 2016 DNVs age).  https://t.co/qBadnyfHcI
1329992370553827331 2020-11-21 11:37:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @AStratelates This is true, but corrupt governments do decay and fall with time. It may take decades, but it does happen.
1329992139690962947 2020-11-21 11:36:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 @AStratelates Well, I don't think it's fake, but it is certainly not the apocalypse it is portrayed as.
1329991464332513281 2020-11-21 11:34:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing Wouldn't shock me.
1329991219360002050 2020-11-21 11:33:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates As I pointed out earlier, we're beyond the point where we can dismiss conspiracies as the thoughts of cranks. Simply too many people believe this system is rigged in some manner. It will either be reformed or it will collapse in on itself in due course.
1329990922797453312 2020-11-21 11:32:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing Everyone's basically looking at each other right now going like "where exactly are these 80 million Biden voters?"
1329985737161388034 2020-11-21 11:11:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep My whole family is going to be getting a new pillow set this holiday season. Best sleep of their lives knowing they supported a good cause.
1329985214395912199 2020-11-21 11:09:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheEorlkonig That’s not a stable foundation on which to build a political movement or a stable political philosophy. Not all governments are corrupt. Reflexively opposing whoever is in power is rank contrarianism.
1329983414515150853 2020-11-21 11:02:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BasedScale @SelimSeesYou Adrian Fontes definitely could fake 10-20K votes if he wanted to.
1329982027555344384 2020-11-21 10:56:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @Theo_Chilton Any case in these starts can get fast tracked.
1329980867746426881 2020-11-21 10:52:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheEorlkonig I’ve seen Tucker morph over the past 15 years from one insurgent movement to the next and he landed on Trumpism because Trump ended up actually being successful in his insurgency. Part of it seems to be genuine disillusionment, but it just strikes me he doesn’t have strong ideas.
1329979584259952640 2020-11-21 10:46:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep Why wouldn’t it be?
1329976854502051843 2020-11-21 10:36:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JackChambersGB @realkingprep I feel like this should involve a pipe.

1329974214112239619 2020-11-21 10:25:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheEorlkonig I've been really skeptical of Tucker since he lost the hard drives and I've long thought he was a bit overrated.

1329972084391497730 2020-11-21 10:17:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheEorlkonig Just that he hopes Sydney Powell proves it, but he is doubtful.

1329963243679453184 2020-11-21 09:42:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ElectionPage Yeah, he should have just stayed quiet. But, this is an ok comeback. Ok. The anonymous sources were dumb.
1329963050758266880 2020-11-21 09:41:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 I’m ok with this tbh. Besides the reference to anonymous sources.
1329962647509463043 2020-11-21 09:39:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m ok with this.

1329950814501269504 2020-11-21 08:52:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing You need like 90% college White and Black turnout in some of these places. The voter file is going to be worth the money to look at if they don’t sort this out. Like, who are these people? Where did they come from?
1329949931495444480 2020-11-21 08:49:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We’re pushing 160 million votes. Going to be the highest turnout rate in decades and decades supposedly.
1329948998808047617 2020-11-21 08:45:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 You’re discounting third parties. More like 156 million.
1329947850952880136 2020-11-21 08:40:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @T51BC He will get creamed in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. He’ll insist on staying through Super Tuesday to further embarrass himself, though.
1329946271604412416 2020-11-21 08:34:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I’ve seen them do this stuff where they lie to your face and then gaslight you into believing it didn’t happen to ever trust media again.

1329945556232318977 2020-11-21 08:31:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> And he only did this to troll Trump from the Senate. His third run will go nowhere.
1329944305860046857 2020-11-21 08:26:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot It’s because they didn’t reject a single ballot for a mismatched signature
1329943852657086465 2020-11-21 08:24:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @hatefuldweeb It’s his account I believe. He might be confused. He is 17.
1329943687648964610 2020-11-21 08:24:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Note this is on a much higher rate where Clark County sent out mail in ballots to even the dead people on the voter rolls.
1329941618649157632 2020-11-21 08:16:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PattyforTrump @davidchapman141 Traditionally judges are extraordinarily wary of throwing out ballots.
1329939691295137799 2020-11-21 08:08:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou He told these counties several times they had until X hour to find ballots. X hour passed. Didn’t find them. 6 hours later: Oh, we found them. Uh huh.
1329939479688335362 2020-11-21 08:07:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The problem is that we run our elections in most states such that, at best, you can never really know if there’s fraud most of the time. Lack of transparency leads to distrust and that distrust is earned.

1329934144038707200 2020-11-21 07:46:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou They pretend like we didn’t watch this live. The mysterious ballots being found everywhere. Sure, GOP counties found a few thousand here and there. Blue counties are just finding them by the truck load.
1329931907631624193 2020-11-21 07:37:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Why are BigLaw lawyers risking disbarment if we have no case?

1329920194848944129 2020-11-21 06:50:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @reformedindixie @ericmetaxas See, you're accusing us of being in a cult of personality. That isn't acceptable. Liking someone is not a cult of personality. I do not worship Trump. I can respect him as a leader, for what he is, without doing those things.
1329918151086256128 2020-11-21 06:42:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @reformedindixie @ericmetaxas 3. If we do not stand up for Trump, we will never get a real change agent in Washington again. What these people intend to do to him personally for merely getting elected is evil. Trump is well within his authority as head of state to do everything in his power to stop Biden.
1329917780540461061 2020-11-21 06:41:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @reformedindixie @ericmetaxas 1. Trump has said he has converted to Evangelical Christianity. He has kept it quiet, but he has said so. It's not ok to slander Christians. 2. This isn't about policy. This is about the fact we have corrupt elections and anyone who doesn't believe that is just naive.
1329916674653491203 2020-11-21 06:36:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jamesdkclark This is like 99% of my job. This is why I have time to Tweet all day.
1329916344473690113 2020-11-21 06:35:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @reformedindixie @ericmetaxas That is not an argument. You clearly do not understand how Trump supporters view the world. We do not trust Republicans either. We do not think this struggle is just about Republicans vs. Democrats.
1329915949877760008 2020-11-21 06:34:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @reformedindixie @ericmetaxas Just because it didn't happen one place doesn't mean it didn't happen in another. Also, I've shared my skepticism about Dominion before. We did NOT get an audit in Georgia of absentees. We have affiants swearing to obviously fake Biden ballots.
1329915237840134146 2020-11-21 06:31:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I see this constantly. At work, my favorite is when some tech starts opening up the command line over a simple display issue. Once saw this guy who thought he was smart struggle for like 30 minutes doing this before I just unplugged it and plugged it back in.
1329914748880769028 2020-11-21 06:29:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Charismatics have crossed the line.
1329913742948241411 2020-11-21 06:25:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @reformedindixie @ericmetaxas You’re accusing Christians (Sydney Powell and Jenna Ellis are both Evangelicals) of not only lying, but conspiring to get people to commit perjury. That’s a serious charge.
1329913045385097218 2020-11-21 06:22:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Lol.
1329911977318244353 2020-11-21 06:18:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @reformedindixie @ericmetaxas Of the three lawsuits the Trump team has filed? You’re enthralled with media lies. Given your constant religious crisis, I guess it shouldn’t be surprising. I’ve given you the benefit of the doubt.
1329910975143800833 2020-11-21 06:14:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @reformedindixie @ericmetaxas Now is not the time for cynicism. Sydney Powell is a respected attorney with a good record and putting her career on the line and so is Jenna Ellis. Give them the benefit of the doubt.
1329901467399049216 2020-11-21 05:36:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Obama start political career on technicality. Trump ends it on technicality. Score.
1329901217334644739 2020-11-21 05:35:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> My reverse Obama theory will be complete if Trump gets a second term.
1329896003953156103 2020-11-21 05:14:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed It's why I think a more responsible, reserved media in both instances would have done a lot to lower tensions right now. It's to the of point of yellow journalism IMO. They seem to want us to hate each other. Not sure what can be done about something that has already happened.
1329895659625984001 2020-11-21 05:13:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed There are human universals here. Your reference to Obama's rise is in line with my theory of Trump as the reverse Obama. Obama's strength gained strength from reflexive media adulation. Trump's gains it from reflexive media derision. 1/2
1329892937631756290 2020-11-21 05:02:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SPLAT07220386 It's literally just human nature. People crave leaders and the Republican base hasn't had a leader they fully respected since Reagan.
1329892552112279552 2020-11-21 05:01:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingofShirgar The numbers are reversed in 2000, 2004, and 2016.
1329891911797252097 2020-11-21 04:58:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's why the media attacks on Trump never really work on his base. It basically has created this symbiotic relationship where the two depend on each other. Treating Trump more fairly probably would have created a weaker bond here.
1329890952861900803 2020-11-21 04:54:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Courage is contagious and Trump is the first GOP leader in ages to show real courage that meant anything to the base. People who make fun of these people or rationalize why they shouldn't feel this way do not recognize the organic nature of the political order.
1329890252790566918 2020-11-21 04:51:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @space_cadet2020 @GranTorinoDSA Repealing NAFTA, 400 miles of border wall, and 50% slashing of legal immigration isn't "nothing."
1329889018625077250 2020-11-21 04:47:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NRxAuthors This won't catch Dominion because it's in blue counties. Allegation on Dominion is they stole votes in red and light blue counties.
1329887512031096834 2020-11-21 04:41:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 Eh, plenty of people do it. Just move there three years in advance. Go to Church. Show up to GOP meetings. Whatever.
1329887289514856448 2020-11-21 04:40:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Probably doesn't want it.
1329887012682428417 2020-11-21 04:39:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 You can move anywhere if you're someone like him.
1329886841428996102 2020-11-21 04:38:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NRxAuthors It's not exactly clear. However, the GOP inspectors are allowed to inspect the absentee ballots and make objections. The GOP wants to create a separate count without these objectionable ballots. Their objections will be recorded and can provide basis for challenge regardless.
1329885827124645888 2020-11-21 04:34:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Odds Nick Fuentes is in Congress within the decade? Lol.
1329885538107666435 2020-11-21 04:33:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 Possible Wood is out on a limb here. Powell is holding her cards closer to her chest, but she is making big noises for sure.
1329884071972003847 2020-11-21 04:27:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you want your vote to count, maybe don't perjure yourself on your ballot application.
1329883935690682368 2020-11-21 04:26:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "Some" is probably on the order of like 140K+ when all is set and done lmao.
1329883378141761536 2020-11-21 04:24:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 Georgia is not gone. Still two days to contest (through Tuesday).
1329883258184732676 2020-11-21 04:24:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK She can submit an intent to resign for January so California can start the process of finding a new Senator. She can then rescind it if fraud is found. Very odd she hasn't even done that.
1329882716926566400 2020-11-21 04:22:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Filmerian1 Seems like we're playing a game of chicken right now.
1329881336883113985 2020-11-21 04:16:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Filmerian1 Not sure there is a good parallel. Seems like a demented Pompey, but without the legal authority to me if I was forced to pick.
1329879382937231363 2020-11-21 04:08:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @QuasLacrimas @Roark1Jacob My projections changed when I saw the strength of turnout and numbers from out state. I thought he’d lose narrowly going into the night. In terms of population percentage, Wisconsin was his strongest increase in the rust belt if I recall. 205K new voters is nothing to sneeze at.
1329878189896847361 2020-11-21 04:04:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sierranolandely @BibMccafferty @SelimSeesYou It was decided in March. We will just take it to SCOTUS if they rule incorrectly. Your tactical respect for states’ rights are laughable.
1329877819111989252 2020-11-21 04:02:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @zattack2016 @SwampFox8 I know. However, the memo is legitimate. While he’s spinning it as some kind of attack on democracy, all it tells me is the WI GOP has their shit together on what to look for.
1329877453536452615 2020-11-21 04:01:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 Agreed and we will have hard stats soon from it.
1329876673802670080 2020-11-21 03:58:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sierranolandely @BibMccafferty @SelimSeesYou The stats on the indefinitely confined ballots were mostly cast under false pretenses to avoid the legal requirement to show ID. The stats and the law on this is pretty clear. Covid is not indefinite confinement.
1329875416635543552 2020-11-21 03:53:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ruintal @SelimSeesYou The Dominion claims are that they stole Trump votes in Red precincts in red to light blue counties. Dominion would not have done this in Milwaukee or Dane counties. Would request a Waukesha and Brown County recount for that.
1329874996613816322 2020-11-21 03:51:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Ok, so they WILL find enough objectionable ballots to overturn it, but it will likely need to be ruled on by the courts afterwards.  https://t.co/vCOaie9wdU
1329874618195308553 2020-11-21 03:49:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The indefinitely confined ballots are well more than enough objections to switch Wisconsin. The others are just gravy.
1329874247913771014 2020-11-21 03:48:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BibMccafferty @SelimSeesYou This is why I think it’s mostly about discovery on the part of Team Trump. Typically you don’t ask for a recount only in your enemy strongholds. Due to the Wisconsin recount rules, this is the easiest place to find potentially fraudulent ballots without court involvement.
1329873804286447617 2020-11-21 03:46:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @luismen1991 They wanted to make it harder to dispute absentees specifically.
1329873303180369926 2020-11-21 03:44:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Mack_J_Devlin @SelimSeesYou Dane was pretty crazy too, but I'm more willing to believe a large turnout increase there on the crazy Anti-Trumper AWFL theory.
1329872757044219906 2020-11-21 03:42:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I just want to say: It is possible that while the recount doesn't overturn the results itself, they find the evidence they need to prove fraud to take it up on challenge.
1329872113768026114 2020-11-21 03:39:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Mack_J_Devlin @SelimSeesYou Yes. The Biden and Trump campaigns are already disputing a lot of absentees in Dane County and Dane is likely less corrupt than Milwaukee.
1329871747240370176 2020-11-21 03:38:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou It is just a recount. It verges on audit territory, so they will be able to do a lot of discovery. Like I said, I think this is partially a trial run for how much they can prove.
1329870947793375234 2020-11-21 03:35:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FifthLibation Foreign. CIA is the big gay.

1329870549305221120 2020-11-21 03:33:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @BritishConserv3 The last Republican leader of the California State Assembly was a Liberty grad lol. They nominate a lot of people who are moderate on social issues, but the party itself really isn't. Have you been to the Central Valley? It's as Evangelical as the rural South.
1329870113118498820 2020-11-21 03:31:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Where do I sign on for your legions?
1329869846339850248 2020-11-21 03:30:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @BritishConserv3 This just isn't true.
1329869650944008199 2020-11-21 03:30:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BritishConserv3 @realikamusume It's not perfect, but is has worked out for the GOP. Certainly more so than a trifecta with two Democrat supermajorities would.
1329869323859595268 2020-11-21 03:28:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @arizona_melissa @SelimSeesYou @realikamusume Talking about the leadership.
1329868929309810690 2020-11-21 03:27:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BritishConserv3 @realikamusume California redistricting is done by an Independent commission. Has an equal number of Democrats and Republicans and there are NPAs as well. The districts are actually remarkably fair for such a D heavy state.
1329868624354488322 2020-11-21 03:26:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @realikamusume If she runs again, it will be for House in a custom built district for her. For some reason Arizona Republicans love that chick.
1329868015375175681 2020-11-21 03:23:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume This is pretty normal in House races lol. Same folks against each other for like 10 years straight.
1329867803017490434 2020-11-21 03:22:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> To clarify: Tucker is not CIA. He still got cucked.
1329867206017101834 2020-11-21 03:20:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's all the CIA. This whole thing is just a battle between the CIA assets and their opponents.
1329866213896359939 2020-11-21 03:16:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There might never be another hero if they get away with that. Mr. Smiths have been afraid to go to Washington for decades. Trump isn't Mr. Smith, but he is the closest thing we have gotten in a long time.
1329865807271260161 2020-11-21 03:14:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @russiancosmist The consequences of Trump being punished personally for daring to be elected President in the first place are the actual acts of sedition against the republic and "democracy."  People who can't see this are just apologists for the system itself.
1329865300611887104 2020-11-21 03:12:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They want you to think the attempt to punish Trump and his loyal supporters is about the "ego" of one man. It isn't. It's an attempt to suppress growing dissent against their entire system. That's why this fight is so important and we need to be all in on it.
1329863741622644738 2020-11-21 03:06:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark @DavidAFrench @RichLowry @AndrewCMcCarthy Momentum is building like crazy. TrueCons are legit terrified right now.
1329862285196730370 2020-11-21 03:00:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> My suspicion is this Wisconsin recount is testing the waters a little for what they can prove.
1329861961098670080 2020-11-21 02:59:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark @DavidAFrench @RichLowry @AndrewCMcCarthy The only poll out right now showing the 2024 race with Trump shows Trump getting 45% of the GOP vote already. Second is Pence at 22%. Romney? 8. Eight percent. And he's third. Trumpism is going NOWHERE.
1329861029917061121 2020-11-21 02:55:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob @QuasLacrimas Given the printed Biden only votes numbering something like 90K in Georgia not sure what you thought the margin would be, but that’s a few percentage points.
1329860198954135552 2020-11-21 02:52:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob @QuasLacrimas That would have been about 2% in the final vote.
1329859431048368129 2020-11-21 02:49:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Filmerian1 The 17th Century and the failure of the religious wars to come to a, for lack of a better term, final resolution to the question of religion have done a number on all aspects of our public religion. The right upholds religion, so it has faced an uphill battle.
1329858963437985792 2020-11-21 02:47:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DaldorenGaming Computers computing the amount of fraud you need to overcome the legit Trump votes has really made people incapable of thinking on their feet.
1329858397609537536 2020-11-21 02:45:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @QuasLacrimas Funny enough, 50-100K was what I thought Trump's legit lead was before the 4 AM votes came in lol.
1329856056986644480 2020-11-21 02:36:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @T51BC He ain't even a real boomercon. True boomercon loves a "Dems stole the election" story.
1329855696523956226 2020-11-21 02:34:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> LOL.
1329854301687181312 2020-11-21 02:29:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law Could never happen now. We're more moral or something.
1329854039740325890 2020-11-21 02:28:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Normal conservatives: Trump delivered when I wasn't sure he would and I distrusted him. I was wrong and I'm happy to stand by him now.  Pseudointellectuals: Trump lacks decorum! This is disgraceful! The Democrats cheated fair and square and we should just roll over!
1329853405494448134 2020-11-21 02:25:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Yujinesque @catturd2 I'm ok with them holding their fire for now.
1329851897071722499 2020-11-21 02:19:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I think he improved in San Diego County, too. Not LA Metro, but has similar politics as it merges into it and is in the CSA.
1329851536088965120 2020-11-21 02:18:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @seepat @catturd2 There was at least Louis Gohmert and newly elected Lauren Boebert. I think there were others, but there were A LOT of speakers, can't remember all of them.

1329850012327694338 2020-11-21 02:12:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Nothing to see here, folks. Just a bunch of people avoiding ID requirements. No reason. Totally legit.

1329847779888410627 2020-11-21 02:03:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Maybe Democrats shouldn't have threatened personal punishment on private citizens who donated to Trump.
1329847439654793218 2020-11-21 02:01:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Georgia: They have two business days to file. So, Tuesday next week at the latest. It is my speculation based on the press conference they are assembling their cases over the weekend and will unleash a flurry of them early next week.
1329847008631402505 2020-11-21 02:00:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> ACB opponents BTFO.   This was one of their talking points.

Also, the Air Force, from which it was formed, is by far the gayest branch. Full of AWFLs, PMCs, and people just looking to avoid actually shooting while still getting VA bennies.
1329843576575053830 2020-11-21 01:46:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm a simp for all of the Trump team women until this is all over. Sue me.

1329838307098943488 2020-11-21 01:25:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 That’s the thing. The GOP base is convinced at this point. I’m not sure anything could dissuade them this election wasn’t stolen. Nothing could dissuade me.
1329838082326204416 2020-11-21 01:24:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 It would be ok if they said they intended on voting in the GOP primary. However, 3.5 years out from that is a long time for intentions to change.
1329837933130559492 2020-11-21 01:24:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 Just that the top line numbers include all Democrats, even the ones who don’t intend on voting in the GOP primary.

I think it’s a lack of testosterone more than anything, but controlled opposition would act no differently.

1329830580666691584 2020-11-21 00:54:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There's always fringe nuts that believe the game is rigged, but when 40+% of the relevant population believe the game is rigged, the game just isn't sustainable. No one shows up to a poker game like this.
1329830277070381057 2020-11-21 00:53:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Large scale belief in conspiracies isn't a sign of a problem with the people that believe conspiracies. It's a sign that the system is flawed. People holding it against laymen for believing conspiracies are ignoring the real problems. Not everyone who believes this is a crank.
1329829689364520962 2020-11-21 00:51:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I get the skepticism over this, I really do. Like I said, I've been skeptical of it too. However, this is just a bad take. If people believe corruption goes that deep, they will want large scale electoral reform across the board.
1329828517908017161 2020-11-21 00:46:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates Which, of course, McConnell has too. Sometimes you're just like "this man singlehandedly saved the Senate." Other times you're like "this guy is a snake."
1329827991677964289 2020-11-21 00:44:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bisquitmelange I said he had more poetry. However, his place in Roman politics was similar. His actions didn't always live up to his lofty words.
1329827695593730049 2020-11-21 00:43:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates Cicero....had some bad moments.
1329827576542613504 2020-11-21 00:42:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SixDegreesOfBob @SelimSeesYou Yeah, it's still a distraction from the direct evidence being presented. Yes, it's of L. Lin Woods' own doing, but that isn't a logical argument against his claims.
1329827199017422852 2020-11-21 00:41:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Reading about Cicero and you realize he's basically just Mitch McConnell with more poetry.
1329826414166732801 2020-11-21 00:38:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @CarlStein1984 I just think these guys deserve the benefit of the doubt. And, quite frankly, we should be willing to go to the mattresses for them. The people who are trying to seize power right now are hate filled and vindictive criminals. Every measure must be taken to prevent it.
1329825708252798980 2020-11-21 00:35:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Filmerian1 People like Erick Erickson insulting these people gall me to no end. They sit around acting pompous about their commitment to “truth,” meanwhile they throw people under the bus at the first sign of trouble.
1329824942234460160 2020-11-21 00:32:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BladesOfChaos70 @SelimSeesYou This is not a filing from a Trump lawyer.
1329824896873078790 2020-11-21 00:32:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou This is not a filing from a Trump lawyer.
1329824686478340097 2020-11-21 00:31:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @CarlStein1984 Shouldn’t Americans be concerned this is even possible? This kind of software manipulation should not even be possible.
1329822812320772105 2020-11-21 00:24:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 That should be enough for discovery at least.
1329822269456179201 2020-11-21 00:21:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OfficialDavidNC @RiddleguyMan Tucker punched right. That's wrong.
1329822155207553026 2020-11-21 00:21:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Regardless of what you think about Giuliani, a reminder that Jenna Ellis and Sydney Powell are officers of the court, member of an Evangelical Christian Church, and are good lawyers. You should give them the benefit of the doubt: They believe they have a case.
1329820332555972617 2020-11-21 00:14:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad Mostly speculative on our part. I imagine they need the weekend to finish putting together their case.
1329819598053662720 2020-11-21 00:11:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They don't even want people to hear evidence, which is probably what Trump's team is going to present to the MI GOP leaders.
1329816082216054789 2020-11-20 23:57:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OakenOdyssey Kemp is basically AWOL and Raffensperger is in on the scam.
1329815583207153664 2020-11-20 23:55:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Not quite as clear cut: The later ballots didn't break as heavily for Trump as the earlier ones. The first set of these ballots were breaking like 66-30 for Trump and the later ones were like 49-47. Yes, it would have been a wider margin for Biden, but not as much.
1329814818891632640 2020-11-20 23:52:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL His claim Trump with 70%....yeah. LMAO.
1329814074834759681 2020-11-20 23:49:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So, here's what's going on in Georgia: Raffensperger has to certify. Then the Trump Camp has to file a contest. Then they can demand a full audit, etc.
1329813140599672833 2020-11-20 23:45:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The usual suspects on the right are spending more time dissecting the 30th page of non-Trump lawyer's legal briefs than confronting the folks that are seriously claiming Trump is engaging in "sedition" and "treason."
1329812571495526405 2020-11-20 23:43:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law All being done ex post facto so they can get rid of Trump quietly and then do some modest reforms so the GOP can stay in power. It's a terrible miscalculation on their part.
1329808090292740097 2020-11-20 23:25:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaleoEconomist I actually don't watch Nick's show that often. I've heard the name. I don't know, I've just always thought Carlson was overrated. A lot of time he invites leftists on his show and just does his stare and I'm like "ok, and?"
1329806619975278598 2020-11-20 23:19:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad These smaller cases are enough to overturn the results in a lot of states anyway.
1329806482020446210 2020-11-20 23:19:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad It's out of context. The cases these lawyers are presenting are substantively different, but the Trump Campaign hasn't filed the mass fraud case yet. It's fundamentally dishonest to use the "they haven't filed" argument. It's not a valid argument logically or legally.
1329805880464994305 2020-11-20 23:16:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaleoEconomist Because he's wrong that Carlson was ever the frontrunner for the 2024 GOP nomination....  Seriously, this a meme among extremely online PopNats. I don't know if Franssen is that.
1329805272790036481 2020-11-20 23:14:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Deus_Rex_Patria I'm not saying that Trump didn't lose ground in the suburbs. I'm saying Atlanta and Philly suburbs represent an utter collapse. Most of these places you are talking about are like 5 points max margin regression. Not 15 point collapses.
1329804461754241029 2020-11-20 23:11:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Deus_Rex_Patria Comparing the results to 2016, it was usually a single digit swing, besides Dallas where it hits exactly 10 in a few counties. Furthermore, none of this is uniform. There were suburbs that swung towards Trump. Atlanta suburbs have the highest swings by far.
1329801783766638594 2020-11-20 23:00:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan We could be in the midst of a hot civil war and guys like this would be like "we might have lost the battle, but at least we didn't hurt anyone!"
1329801210304589826 2020-11-20 22:58:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan I was surprised when I saw Trump friendly posts earlier this year from them.
1329800991919775746 2020-11-20 22:57:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BretagnePoint I agree, it's very suspect how strategic these collapses: Limited to areas with key Democratic officeholders.
1329800416985554945 2020-11-20 22:55:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou There were several times when the Georgia Secretary of State reported less outstanding ballots than Trump's margin of victory and they just kept finding more.
1329798305333829635 2020-11-20 22:46:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Among Republicans, it's 45 Trump-22 Pence-8 Romney.
1329797163904348164 2020-11-20 22:42:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Imagine thinking Trump supporters think this is solely about Republicans vs. Democrats.
1329795070401376256 2020-11-20 22:33:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark Yeah, they did some "math" and determined that if we don't do lockdowns, 6 million of us will die. It's anuddah shoah.
1329794527448723456 2020-11-20 22:31:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These people ducking questions should at least raise some eyebrows. I was definitely skeptical of the Dominion thing to start with, but they definitely behave as if they have a guilty conscious.
1329793512385224709 2020-11-20 22:27:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JimmyKPolk11 @SelimSeesYou Wisconsin it account for TEN TIMES Biden’s margin of victory because of how many people illegally said they were “indefinitely confined” and thus skipped the need to provide identification of any sort.
1329680862326235137 2020-11-20 14:59:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly I don’t like arbitrary wage controls in general, so I generally only support modest minimum wage increases. Especially federally. $15 minimum wage would kill small businesses in Middle America.
1329680228248117248 2020-11-20 14:57:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat He blocked me. I have no idea what he thinks these days lol. So has Taylor Marshall actually. Forgot what I even did to offend.
1329679822382125056 2020-11-20 14:55:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat We’re about ready to seize power for some kind of pan-Christian blogger theocracy.
1329679095186264065 2020-11-20 14:52:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Our “never punch right” rule is one that I’ve long thought is the most important piece of strategic advice the right can adopt. If someone is out there pushing a narrative for the right, and you don’t want to be associated, just don’t say anything. You get no points attacking it.
1329677720024965120 2020-11-20 14:47:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CosmoDiGirolamo @SelimSeesYou @17cShyteposter The thing that happened in Wisconsin is the Milwaukee clerk personally counted 169K ballots alone in a room with no observers at like 3 AM.
1329677154678956037 2020-11-20 14:45:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Pozzidonius1 @SelimSeesYou @17cShyteposter Yeah, the early mail ins they counted split for Biden, but reasonably so. By the end they were counting these 90% Biden batches everywhere. Even Erie County LMAO. Was ridiculous.
1329675244085374979 2020-11-20 14:37:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @QuasLacrimas @17cShyteposter @Outsideness Very true. There’s also the McCain factor. Still convinced there’s no way Biden got over a million votes in Maricopa County.
1329674738021568518 2020-11-20 14:35:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @hyperboriankiwi I am going to miss this man so much.
1329672269732438017 2020-11-20 14:25:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @QuasLacrimas @17cShyteposter @Outsideness Yeah, the results where I got this map show Ohio at 3% for Trump and Florida was very narrow. I couldn’t manage to get Arizona to flip outside a Biden landslide, but there are local oddities every election, I suppose.
1329670953484365824 2020-11-20 14:20:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago If they stole the election, that would in fact be a seditious conspiracy.
1329670711951101954 2020-11-20 14:19:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @QuasLacrimas @17cShyteposter @Outsideness *swing against Trump.
1329670621769457664 2020-11-20 14:19:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @QuasLacrimas @17cShyteposter @Outsideness Basically the only why I get anything close to these results in the Cook Swingometer is to push Black turnout to 75% AND push college White turnout to 85% and have those groups swing Trump. Just utterly ridiculous. And it only happens in 4-5 states: The others are totally off.
1329668451305218051 2020-11-20 14:10:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The shadiness alone should be enough to invalidate the results. Please don’t say “democracy dies in darkness” and then literally hide your ballot counting in the dark of night. Confession through projection.
1329667080971579394 2020-11-20 14:05:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It will be challenged. Calm down.
1329666178432835584 2020-11-20 14:01:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Doomgroyp @SelimSeesYou More of a mix. Philadelphia was a Republican machine through the 40s. New York's Democratic aligned Tammany Hall is the mother of all machines, though. The machines used to be a bit more independent and willing to help the other team from time to time when they weren't greased.
1329665697669144577 2020-11-20 13:59:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @hyperboriankiwi Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis are Anglos. I guess our womenfolk have to represent us.
1329665280440721408 2020-11-20 13:58:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @hyperboriankiwi Hannity isn't actually a Roman Catholic anymore. Think he has gone charismatic.
1329664696752934920 2020-11-20 13:55:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Doomgroyp @SelimSeesYou Anyone who doesn't believe Democrats cheat in elections is just naive. Machine cities have been printing ballots for the party in power since the 19th Century.
1329663304273453056 2020-11-20 13:50:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @SelimSeesYou Only 9 of the seats the GOP lost were open, so incumbents retiring was not the primary cause of lost seats. Incumbency was hardly even a factor. The number of lost California seats that flipped days after the election was suspect. That and NJ and VA are corrupt.
1329662572405067776 2020-11-20 13:47:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Doomgroyp @SelimSeesYou The evidence coming out leads me to believe Bush probably won Wisconsin and potentially Pennsylvania in 2004.
1329661843439308801 2020-11-20 13:44:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Filmerian1 What I am saying is that ascertaining who are the legitimate authorities you should obey is not always a clear cut thing. Usually by the time a civil war has reached critical mass such that either side could win, both sides have some arguable legitimacy.
1329661188146405377 2020-11-20 13:41:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Filmerian1 It's mostly an historical talking point anyway. Whoever has committed "treason" is determined by whoever loses the civil war. It is rarely so morally clear cut before it actually happens.
1329660485222998017 2020-11-20 13:38:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago People accusing Trump of sedition should look that up too. As far as I'm aware he has not conspired to engage in an act of insurrection.
1329660064358146048 2020-11-20 13:37:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's not even clear to me that an act of insurrection would be an act of treason by this definition because it seems to imply an external enemy. Of course, insurrection is its own crime.
1329659646043414529 2020-11-20 13:35:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Actual definition of Treason: "Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort."  The United States is not at war with anyone, therefore you cannot commit treason.
1329658848127438848 2020-11-20 13:32:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PerryforAnkeny @RealAPolitics 1. Question begging. 2. That is not treason.
1329653808276926465 2020-11-20 13:12:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart That's one reason the protests are important. These people need to know we're not going away no matter what.
1329653185359785986 2020-11-20 13:09:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical If you've ever been to a GOP state convention, you'd know how true this is.
1329652718869360641 2020-11-20 13:08:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart The legislators are under immense pressure right now. Something like 90% of Trump's voters assume this was stolen at this point and all of these people just got re-elected on Trump votes.
1329651519004823554 2020-11-20 13:03:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical Not sure about lesbo. Heard she got around quite a bit on her way to the Governor's Mansion, though.
1329651060638707713 2020-11-20 13:01:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart I don't think so. We're too entrenched at this point. Rudy was speaking to Trump's sympathizers directly.
1329650574367797252 2020-11-20 12:59:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @attyzachmiller Don't get me wrong, I like most of what Trump has done and think some don't give him enough credit and I generally trust his political instincts.
1329650172008296451 2020-11-20 12:57:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart I don't get how you think it was rambling. Yes, he spent time at the beginning criticizing the media, but then he brought out details.
1329649205577609217 2020-11-20 12:54:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart They presented witness testimony in the form of sworn affidavits. That is evidence. They clearly got enough that if this wasn't the Presidency, the elections in these states would be thrown out. It is precedented to do so below the Presidential level.
1329648844372635650 2020-11-20 12:52:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There's a cringe tier of trusting the plan where you just assume whatever Trump does is good, but he's the leader right now. At some point you just have to stand back and stand by.
1329639729927741440 2020-11-20 12:16:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WeWontExtinct @BeigeShiba Everyone on FNC is suspect due to their obvious collusion with the Biden campaign in this whole process.
1329637658532982788 2020-11-20 12:08:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Filmerian1 Spain 1936 is a very close parallel given the rigged election followed by the widespread intimidation campaign.
1329635482301554688 2020-11-20 11:59:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Filmerian1 It feels that way. Where are we on the timeline? Is this being compressed? So many uncertainties.
1329635149093494786 2020-11-20 11:58:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These people are trying to make us feel we have no peaceful means of redress and our only hope is to use whatever offices and power we have left to simply defend ourselves. We are not the ones forcing the fighting here.
1329634642715086850 2020-11-20 11:56:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> What is the opposition’s goal by openly threatening Trump’s team with trying them for treason or sedition? Why are they forcing the stakes to be so high?   We know they’re not just going after Trump because of petty personal corruption or something. We know they hate us.
1329633557480869888 2020-11-20 11:51:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim These guys just don’t even want to hear the other side.
1329632787834560513 2020-11-20 11:48:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba He hasn’t been talking about the election fraud and took time out of his day to bash Sydney Powell, who most of us over here respect for her work with the Michael Flynn case (she basically saved his ass). She also had an accomplished legal career before that.
1329631809672515585 2020-11-20 11:45:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theeternalright Yeah a lot of people are on death’s door with cancer or are just old or something and die with the flu. No one thinks it was the flu that really did them in, though.
1329631320251768833 2020-11-20 11:43:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical @SelbJim Tucker’s problem is he is coming at this from a very intellectual and cynical angle. He has said many times he is a cynic in the past. These aren’t times in which to be a cynic.
1329629852673191937 2020-11-20 11:37:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK That news conference is what we were waiting for. Some needed affirmation that we have a case.
1329628380992593920 2020-11-20 11:31:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @JayFiveK They desperately cling to empty talking points.
1329627039486369793 2020-11-20 11:26:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sadpianonoises @SelimSeesYou This is all rather unprecedented and is more indicative of our rotten elections than anything else. American elections have long been the most corrupt in the western world. No one has ever tried what Trump is trying right now, so we will likely get new precedent.
1329623914406948873 2020-11-20 11:13:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Obviously printed ballots in the Atlanta Metro seems like a serious story to me. 9 eyewitnesses identified specific boxes where these things were located.
1329623486722084865 2020-11-20 11:11:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I mean, who even thinks to do this stuff? You have dirt on the DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE.
1329622346618040321 2020-11-20 11:07:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Linkoln63081697 @NickJFuentes Yes, he means what he says. He isn’t just a raw propagandist. Few right wingers are.

1329621774959599618 2020-11-20 11:05:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Imagine siding with a journalist over two former federal prosecutors and Jenna Ellis.
1329620699594547203 2020-11-20 11:00:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CthulhuRight @NickJFuentes Tucker fancies himself an intellectual. Hannity has no such pretentious.
1329620432807399425 2020-11-20 10:59:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Linkoln63081697 @NickJFuentes Hannity’s whole shtick is exposing Dems doing crap like this. Would be incredibly odd if he didn’t claim the Democrats stole a close election.
1329620189835644929 2020-11-20 10:58:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NickJFuentes BASED BOOMER IS BASED
1329618660768559104 2020-11-20 10:52:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Not sure I’d contact the Feds to be honest.
1329618174363447299 2020-11-20 10:50:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago Denying the mounting evidence of fraud is a classic case of obscurantism, though.
1329617576306020355 2020-11-20 10:48:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Election obscurantism is rampant on the left.

1329616224117018629 2020-11-20 10:43:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @juanjromero @NickJFuentes Eyewitness testimony is hard evidence.
1329615863343947785 2020-11-20 10:41:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I love how the left has taken to calling righties snowflakes for not wanting to lose our jobs or be assaulted for having the wrong opinions.

1329613028149620739 2020-11-20 10:30:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Isn’t Harris a mix of urban and suburban? I’d think Dallas is the most classically urban county in Texas.

1329611059506843654 2020-11-20 10:22:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Now is not the time for cynicism. For everything there is a season.
1329610698113114112 2020-11-20 10:21:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MaritimeLoyal This has been proposed since before World War II lol. They used to want to form their own state with NorCal called “Jefferson.” Guess they figure this way they can escape by consent as the GOP won’t gain any Senate seats in this process.
1329609123969851395 2020-11-20 10:14:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Thamer72663870 She is putting her reputation on the line for this. Give her the benefit of the doubt.

1329607613286395908 2020-11-20 10:08:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Based.

Giuliani and Powell obviously have reputations, but the fact Ellis is putting her reputation on the line for this speaks to me personally.
1329603496732192774 2020-11-20 09:52:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis Well, then there’s The Final Act if it’s totally corrupt.
1329602878097461248 2020-11-20 09:50:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis They’re basically going to war. From our perspective, they deserve the benefit of the doubt until proven otherwise at this point. The low level fraud seems well documented at this point.
1329600506348662786 2020-11-20 09:40:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @TenorTerrific They’re not technical. @CodeMonkeyZ is and said he is releasing information on Saturday.
1329599526106238976 2020-11-20 09:36:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 He just wants ratings and clear has orders to dispirit the base.

1329598650016739330 2020-11-20 09:33:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Deus_Rex_Patria She’s alleging a vast conspiracy. You don’t lay out your evidence in public until these people are dead to rights.
1329597590875287559 2020-11-20 09:29:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Tucker took his 30 pieces, I’m sad to say.
1329597467986419713 2020-11-20 09:28:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Tucker took the 30 pieces.
1329596783295651841 2020-11-20 09:25:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 @Theo_Chilton I mean Trump needs to use any political capital to reorient the structure of our politics. Punish the fraudsters, expose them, enact legislations a wide berth of issues. Stuff that can’t just get taken back when a Democrat gets in.
1329595122259021825 2020-11-20 09:19:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton All I hope is that this isn’t all for just a second term.
1329592474583650305 2020-11-20 09:08:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Yeah, that’s why I voted for him. It’s legitimately the reason.
1329592071414554626 2020-11-20 09:07:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 An “audit” with no observers, no reconciliation of the poll books, no signature checking. Fulton County also refused cert for the same reasons Wayne did.
1329590732924006408 2020-11-20 09:01:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Apparently the new victory margin is 12,284 votes.
1329590211584659456 2020-11-20 08:59:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Has anyone released a new total vote count for the Georgia recount?
1329589895497736193 2020-11-20 08:58:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> LMAO.
1329588840030474240 2020-11-20 08:54:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Our people are losing their livelihoods left and right. Gotta stick with the team, frens.
1329587149008670725 2020-11-20 08:47:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal Too bad Britt Grant went over to the Federal bench. I'm a simp, I'm sorry.
1329585048731922435 2020-11-20 08:39:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I just think this is impossible. The head of state just is an important position regardless of whether you hinder its legal power. It's the person the people look to for leadership in times of need.
1329584249733779456 2020-11-20 08:36:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL @RupertVonRipp @realikamusume I think it's the hillbillies' turn to get some loot. That's all I'm saying.
1329583122829152259 2020-11-20 08:31:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Yes. If you don’t believe this is possible, and probably even likely, you’re just dense.
1329573075294294018 2020-11-20 07:51:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL @ScottMGreer They need to be sent to prison.

1329570283234205698 2020-11-20 07:40:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 I think it was about the vaccine. I know he said they had a 100 million of them ready.
1329569323506163715 2020-11-20 07:36:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK You think there’s 70 million of them?
1329568354718412800 2020-11-20 07:32:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal Their days are numbered.

Apparently her record is stellar for this field. Represents Michael Flynn.
1329563130419089409 2020-11-20 07:12:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @eddiecarl4468 @SelimSeesYou @SidneyPowell1 Imagine not standing besides your fellow patriots during trying times such as these.  It is certainly true right now, "We shall all hang together or we shall surely hang separately."
1329562335644626947 2020-11-20 07:08:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's always one way with these people. They never take anything on a case by case basis.
1329562114952998914 2020-11-20 07:08:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I like how lefties have went from accusing courts of systematic White supremacy to claiming none of them could possibly be corrupt.
1329560378284630017 2020-11-20 07:01:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> As usual, dumb lefties mispresenting what was said.
1329560056778682379 2020-11-20 06:59:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SuzyQL @JennaEllisEsq That says more about the court than the witnesses.
1329556587724353537 2020-11-20 06:46:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @orange_snail @alemuji546 @JennaEllisEsq Trump’s team has only filed three cases and the case they withdrew today was because they already got the relief they were asking for.
1329556345637507072 2020-11-20 06:45:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GarrettFAdams There’s allegations they’re not even doing a real hand recount and also the possibility they simply didn’t do the algorithm in Georgia.
1329555808745566209 2020-11-20 06:43:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Apparently. It’s all so incestuous.
1329555543166492676 2020-11-20 06:41:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @zattack2016 @realikamusume I want him to certify it without a final official tally. Seems local officials are only reporting their original tallies.
1329555236898353153 2020-11-20 06:40:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Dude apparently has a relative on the board of Huawei who retweets Lincoln Project stuff.
1329554538135773184 2020-11-20 06:37:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LokiJulianus This is all one incestuous criminal gang.
1329554309978189824 2020-11-20 06:37:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Raffensperger wants to go to prison now too.
1329554002221084681 2020-11-20 06:35:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cowmix @CarlStein1984 I mean, it was pretty funny and it was obvious what the narrative would be the moment you could tell he was sweating.
1329552944908398598 2020-11-20 06:31:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @alemuji546 @orange_snail @JennaEllisEsq They've already made sworn affidavits and put themselves at risk of perjury charges. The idea we're just irrational conspiracists for believing sworn testimony isn't serious.
1329552505206878208 2020-11-20 06:29:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Because one time Rudy conceded a race 31 years ago, he can never claim any other election was fraudulent.
1329552175295553536 2020-11-20 06:28:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JennaEllisEsq You have several sworn witnesses that you presented. The idea that you have "no evidence" is beyond parody at this point.
1329551765583384581 2020-11-20 06:26:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The narrative on the left has went from "no evidence" to "no merit." LMAO.
1329551072508129282 2020-11-20 06:24:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AsTheW0rIdBrns @ScottMGreer The number of dumbass libertarian gun owners using the deep state ATF bureaucrats' 11th hour action on pistol bracers to suppress Trump turnout was ridiculous.
1329548949896777729 2020-11-20 06:15:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad Yeah. Destabilizing and evil regime is actually good.
1329548647755870208 2020-11-20 06:14:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IgnatiusR99 @unseen1_unseen The 74% in PA was particularly of interest. Biden needed 75% of the outstanding vote and there was Election Day vote that hadn’t been counted. He got these absolute dictator margins in more than the number of expected mail ins in Allegheny and Philadelphia, though.
1329546591452147712 2020-11-20 06:06:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CityBureaucrat I can confirm this firsthand.
1329546033370640386 2020-11-20 06:04:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 Most elections, anyway. Our population isn't growing as fast as it used to. Number of voters went down in 2012 compared to 2008. The insane turnout increase is one of the red flags. We're going to end up with the highest turnout rate in decades apparently.
1329544774303543297 2020-11-20 05:59:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics After we expose the fraud in the Dem machine counties, yes.
1329544547211358217 2020-11-20 05:58:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 Starting to think you're right after the press conference.
1329543756777918464 2020-11-20 05:55:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It has been determined through scientific survey that Biden could not have gotten more than 72 million votes.
1329543504771559424 2020-11-20 05:54:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Here's my sales pitch for Italy:  https://t.co/OdBz3WwupR
1329543085236293637 2020-11-20 05:52:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Oh, I'm judging.
1329542300603650053 2020-11-20 05:49:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy Trump has gotten 1.5 million more voters IN CALIFORNIA. and supposedly he lost. How do Trump's margins stay the same in Orange County and collapse in Cobb? Makes no sense.
1329542012081672192 2020-11-20 05:48:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp That makes sense. Those came near the end of my schooling. Mostly was just the real dangers of fire and earthquake.   I have to say, the idea of getting bombed by the Russians was much more thrilling than getting shot at by some psycho.
1329540852847431680 2020-11-20 05:43:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I think we were the last class that had air raid drills in California. I remember them in 1st grade anyway. Watched the drill videos about potential nuclear strikes. This was all after the USSR collapsed of course.
1329539978108563458 2020-11-20 05:40:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp These people remind me of a girl in elementary school who was afraid the Russians had done 9/11 the day after and was worried we'd be nuked (we were in the middle of nowhere as far as California was concerned at the time).
1329538567345942533 2020-11-20 05:34:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 Open top two primary.
1329535961190043648 2020-11-20 05:24:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We're going to unseat Kamala Harris in 2022 and replace her with a based Hispanic who wants to help make the wall 10 feet higher.
1329531918803755014 2020-11-20 05:08:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Even the CNN pundits were like "where are these votes coming from." It seems like only FNC was in on it. Wouldn't be surprised if the media end of this op wasn't coordinated through the NeverTrump wing.
1329531353289928704 2020-11-20 05:05:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL That seems to have been what happened. They needed these 95% Biden vote dumps of votes people either didn't know existed or we now know were from sketchy sources to start.
1329530599133110279 2020-11-20 05:02:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LaurenHailey201 Especially when you looked at similar counties in Ohio: It was obvious even earlier in the night the math for Biden just wasn't there in the rust belt (except, maybe, Michigan). Then the counting stopped and hundreds of thousands of new mail ins, 95% for Biden, were found.
1329530180692537345 2020-11-20 05:01:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @lazlototh67 @unseen1_unseen 2 AM is about when they started claiming they had all these votes out that didn't exist before. Except Georgia, which kept finding ballots for days afterwards. LMAO.
1329528674073317377 2020-11-20 04:55:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> You could tell the later returns would tighten the race and make it relatively close because of where the votes left out were coming from, but it was impossible for Biden to get 3.4 million votes in Pennsylvania at midnight on election night.
1329528382565060615 2020-11-20 04:54:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The finding more votes thing was utterly absurd. I'm confident in my ability to analyze returns as an amateur. It was basically impossible for Biden to overcome Trump's leads as of around 11 PM to midnight. But all these votes mysteriously appeared no one knew existed.
1329527168871882753 2020-11-20 04:49:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou He didn't botch it, you see. According to his ex post facto manipulated polling data, it wasn't actually that wrong.
1329526875056713729 2020-11-20 04:48:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Always the same crap with leftists: Refusal to address substantive issues and focusing on a misspelling on the 10th page of a brief in some random case.
1329526188809842695 2020-11-20 04:45:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They're just going to have SCOTUS hand them the electors. Ballsy.
1329525291161628672 2020-11-20 04:41:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @michaeljburry @bronzeagemantis They also fake the averages after the election.
1329524979587817476 2020-11-20 04:40:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal If we have to throw out an election to get an honest one in the future, then, oh by gosh by golly, that's what we're going to do.
1329524618537934855 2020-11-20 04:39:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Mr. Baris said he is likely to go into the field to survey this.
1329524294347595791 2020-11-20 04:37:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @Theo_Chilton I think parsimony is overrated. It's helpful for shaving stuff down, but it isn't usual a means of finding truth itself. Complex conspiracies and systems exist.
1329522997879840775 2020-11-20 04:32:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bronzeagemantis Not even worth engaging with these people at this point. They don't even want to interact with evidence.
1329521975929266176 2020-11-20 04:28:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnbourbon98 I am unsure. However, Arizona's elections laws sound kind of ridiculous to me. Extremely narrow margins to even request a recount. No mechanism for challenging with the Secretary of State. Seems like there's no accountability outside of just going to court.
1329521187475611648 2020-11-20 04:25:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton I think there's an "I know it when I see it" aspect to ridiculous claims. Some dude with a wild eye claiming something fantastical, yeah, I'm not going to take him as seriously as a dude who's just trying to read between the lines of UN reports.
1329518676857516035 2020-11-20 04:15:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CalebJHull @MarkHerringVA There's actually a Wal Mart in the parking lot of this gun show.
1329518447223508992 2020-11-20 04:14:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Well, line's going to be long tomorrow.
1329518216033554437 2020-11-20 04:13:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal Dang. I intended to go to this tomorrow.
1329516534000185345 2020-11-20 04:06:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This happened 15,000 times in Allegheny County alone. That many people don’t forget they voted. Usually it’s a small percentage of mostly old people.
1329515877335773185 2020-11-20 04:04:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp That's why I used "peer review": The whole thing has become a sham. It's all just the same people citing each other over and over acting like they're intellectually superior because they have some increasingly meaningless credentials.
1329514283110195203 2020-11-20 03:58:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "Well we called the (scientists, pollsters, election officials) and they all denied any wrongdoing. Must not be true."
1329514018525089794 2020-11-20 03:56:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is basically the whole intellectual environment in a nutshell: A bunch of people citing each other in a spiral of peer review where all dissenting voices are just denied a seat at the table.
1329513625317421058 2020-11-20 03:55:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "Thou shalt trust AP factchecks."
1329508987704905730 2020-11-20 03:36:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m thinking of Trump’s last rally where he accused the opposite camp of treason and said he’d prove it.
1329508699472351235 2020-11-20 03:35:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Facts.
1329507290945363969 2020-11-20 03:30:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK They'd have been better off just letting us win and throwing us a few bones.

1329503241109909507 2020-11-20 03:14:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Democrats were always corrupt, but supporting them after this goes down will be like literally voting for the head of the Italian mafia.

1329501134260678656 2020-11-20 03:05:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Miche1T @bronzeagemantis @TeamTrump For the Presidency, yes. I think they're going to end up with enough to throw out some Democratic Senate and House wins too.
1329500389218136067 2020-11-20 03:02:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bronzeagemantis @TeamTrump I think their goal at this point is to prove systemic fraud to throw out the results entirely. Whole redos.

1329495294774546433 2020-11-20 02:42:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All these people have are threats and empty denialism.

1329494247049977866 2020-11-20 02:38:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biden votes should forever come with an asterisk.
1329493651634982925 2020-11-20 02:36:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Been told by people I’ve been shadow  banned. Finally earned my place as a proper dissident.

1329490064443928576 2020-11-20 02:21:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates Basically the Trump lawyers gave an opening statement and laid out their hundreds of witnesses to crazy stuff like mass fake ballot printings, potential electronic fraud, etc. A lot of the stuff has already been said, but this was systematic.
1329487786567753731 2020-11-20 02:12:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Basically everything to the right of Virginia and maybe even that.

1329483861068279812 2020-11-20 01:57:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JBFalke Hundreds of thousands of fake votes. The evidence of Dominion fraud is mounting. Lots of affiants providing evidence.
1329483425389162496 2020-11-20 01:55:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We’re apparently just rigging elections all over the place. Get rekt globalists.

1329482560863416320 2020-11-20 01:51:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m convinced now: Trump won a bigger landslide than even I thought possible.
1329482411785195524 2020-11-20 01:51:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK This is literally the exact thing he did to the mob, but with money instead of votes. It’s all the same.

1329468725339287552 2020-11-20 00:56:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Miche1T This totally isn't a crisis. Biden will just be a normal moderate Dem like Bill Clinton. Totally won't surrender our sovereignty and put us all into a pod. The Founders wanted us to slavishly adhere to procedural norms while the country gets destroyed.
1329463811523350528 2020-11-20 00:37:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @SwampFox8 Speculating on a President Romney is borderline paranoia, I have to say. This would be political suicide for Republicans.
1329463520342183938 2020-11-20 00:36:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 @realikamusume This is a widespread misconception. All the SCOTUS said is that you can enforce existing state statutes on electors, including replacing faithless electors. A lot of states don't really have faithless elector statutes or merely punish you with a small fine.
1329459869372608515 2020-11-20 00:21:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I can see a Biden/Pence Admin emerging. With Biden’s health, wouldn’t shock me if Pence would become the President eventually.
1329457311346286605 2020-11-20 00:11:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Top 3 for President and Top 2 for Vice President after the Twelfth Amendment.

1329451094154633221 2020-11-19 23:46:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad I'm confident as of this moment we will get them. Let's wait for the news conference, though.

1329439616215158786 2020-11-19 23:01:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL I've support Trump since the escalator and it's all water under the bridge now. Like, who cares? We have to focus on tomorrow.
1329439355203690498 2020-11-19 23:00:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IngrahamAngle We forgive her. Next.
1329439111434936321 2020-11-19 22:59:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ori_Ar Yeah, a lot of House people end up bunking unless they're in a safe district and have lots of personal wealth. Senators are there for 6 years at least and Hawley is no stranger to DC.
1329438833587400707 2020-11-19 22:58:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We all make mistakes from time to time.

1329437513199521795 2020-11-19 22:52:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL Not the kind of life I wanted to live for very long. However, the thing with BigLaw is there's no real down season. The horror stories of writing briefs on Christmas are rare enough, but combine that with a rat race to get the most hours to get partner and it's just like "no."
1329436449427628034 2020-11-19 22:48:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL I never considered being a big 4 auditor, but I know the average work week of a BigLaw lawyer is like 60 hours and some firms have averages north of 70.
1329435658939740161 2020-11-19 22:45:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL Getting a SCOTUS clerkship is hitting the law school lotto. A big payday, work for like two years collecting the big bucks in BigLaw in the chillest BigLaw department where  you set your own hours (still a lot of work), and then do literally whatever you want.
1329434841230827520 2020-11-19 22:42:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL In the timeframe Hawley was a SCOTUS clerk and then went to work for Hogan Lovells, he likely would have gotten at least a quarter of a million dollar bonus, possibly north of 300 grand. That's a signing bonus.
1329434440926453765 2020-11-19 22:40:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL Home prices are kind of weird in the DC area: There's a high bottom and relatively low ceiling (kind of like the salaries), but you're correct. You're looking at a decent sized home in a good neighborhood, but nothing crazy. Hawley was also a SCOTUS clerk, so he had a big payday.
1329432925604110345 2020-11-19 22:34:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Senator spends most of his time around DC. Shocking!
1329432333607464960 2020-11-19 22:32:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou *counting was done. Haven't had my coffee yet lol
1329432157299806208 2020-11-19 22:31:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Virginia 7, they found a few thousand votes for Spanberger when the counties was supposedly dumb and Freitas was ahead by a couple thousand.
1329430276636815364 2020-11-19 22:24:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnbourbon98 Then you have the counter that the act of voting itself was done under duress.

1329307897344503808 2020-11-19 14:17:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> After all the fraud is revealed, we learn there are only actually 30 million Democrats in the country and the rest of their votes are just fake.

1329291279306551298 2020-11-19 13:11:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden Yeah, I don't see this going 100% smoothly in a 24 hour period throughout the entire United States. The military is the sole organization even able to attempt it, though.   Also, I'm no anti-vaxxer, but my spidey senses are tingling with this one.
1329290706515582987 2020-11-19 13:09:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal They're really ballsy even trying this. They basically just tried to ram stuff through by force of will at the last minute and GOP-leaning people are just like "yeah, nice try."
1329289622417969156 2020-11-19 13:05:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden Yeah, this is just how military guys talk. It sounds all forceful because that's what they're used to, but it's not like GIs are going to be at your door to stab you with a needle.

1329288847553912839 2020-11-19 13:02:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> That isn't quite what he was saying. He said "all of America" should get it within 24 hours. This doesn't mean everyone is going to be forced to get the vaccine within 24 hours of it being authorized. It means every locality will have access to it.
1329286931281219585 2020-11-19 12:54:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee Our courts are kangaroo courts. Nearly all of the judges from your local county judge to the Justices of the Supreme Court have become partisans and one of the parties is completely uninterested in the pursuit of justice and the other is easily manipulated.

1329282074616926208 2020-11-19 12:35:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So, we have hundreds of affiants swearing, among other things:  1. Fake Biden-only ballots that appear to have legit been printed. 2. Workers receiving bribes. 3. Being denied access to counting observation.   This is just the tip of the iceberg.
1329281287966896128 2020-11-19 12:32:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Bribes directed at elections workers from private actors. Seriously, just throw this election out. The whole thing.

1329280403597893632 2020-11-19 12:28:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 9 affiants swore. Christians dismissing this as nothing have a standard of evidence higher than the Bible itself.

1329255755548069891 2020-11-19 10:50:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This electorate and the results are just mindboggling. Precinct level data.

It's not as strong as Caesar's loyalty, but it might be strong enough.

At the end of the day, Trump, like Caesar, has reformed the VA to such a great degree that many Vets are personally living better lives. They are loyal.
1329245527838486528 2020-11-19 10:10:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theJackAndrews @SelimSeesYou Trump's base and platform are very similar in terms of relative socio-political rank. Their platforms are extraordinarily similar too. People are just wealthier in general than they were historically (basically any time before the 60s). A lot of his supporters are terrified too.
1329244568156565506 2020-11-19 10:06:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou If I had to bet, I'd have to get some pretty good odds before I'd bet Trump would do it. However, given what these people intend to do to him and his supporters, the odds are much higher than at any other point in American history. Still, all other avenues should be exhausted.

1329234970339139592 2020-11-19 09:28:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These suburban anti-Trump swings aren't even uniform either. Broward and Palm Beach, with very Northern Demos, swung towards Trump. So did Osceola. In Ohio, some swung towards Trump, others 2-4 point regression. Why are these voters so different? Obvious answer is obvious.
1329234557569282049 2020-11-19 09:26:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> You can detect slight suburban White swings against Trump, but why is it extremely pronounced in Pennsylvania and Georgia to the point of utter collapse? If these had swung similar to the 2-5 points, with better rural Trump margins, in other states, Trump wins.
1329234140550541313 2020-11-19 09:24:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If we can't sort out this fraud thing and get a genuine count, these five states need to be studied in depth to understand why their voters behaved so differently from similar voters in other states.

Sam Reed did purge the rolls of the hundreds of thousands of dead and movers that were on there, though. Of course, that was after 2004 was stolen.

1329188829945884675 2020-11-19 06:24:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Somehow, the Washington Secretary of State's office has been held by a Republican since 1965 and the Republican just got elected to another term. Wasn't even close.

1329147488364883972 2020-11-19 03:40:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Considering Republicans have long argued we are a "republic, not a democracy," I think they've already decided.
1329147287671599108 2020-11-19 03:39:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> French Davidianism is rootless cosmopolitanism wrapped up in a few Bible verses taken out of context.   Being not of this world isn't an excuse for your lack of filial affection.

1329140971238531074 2020-11-19 03:14:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics It was the realignment. The realignment that only seemed to happen in states that use Dominion software and paused their vote count.

1329138041919823873 2020-11-19 03:02:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you actually open up the poll, Romney is at 11% among Republicans and 38% of the whole US sample wants Trump to run again.

1329112705043755009 2020-11-19 01:22:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I always love when demonic leftists threaten you with hell. It has become a much more common thing since they’ve been trying to use Trump’s personal foibles to suppress GOP Evangelical turnout.

1329104051737403392 2020-11-19 00:47:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law @realDonaldTrump Thank you for not backing down.
1329103595900456967 2020-11-19 00:46:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DaldorenGaming On the state level, yes. This is true in a lot of states, actually. Reverse is true of State GOPs in very blue states. The Federal party is usually closer to the national positioning in both cases, though. Bullock would have been a faith Dem vote had he gotten into the Senate.
1329102203756437504 2020-11-19 00:40:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DaldorenGaming Schweitzer and Bullock were both pretty solid on guns, though. With GOP state legislatures, you wouldn't have known the difference. Schweitzer even passed a law attempting to exempt Montanans from all federal gun regulations.
1329101652318703617 2020-11-19 00:38:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's Trump's sacred duty to prevent this election from being stolen. Pass it on.

1329095621110796290 2020-11-19 00:14:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The only people who have confidence in this system are those that benefit from it.
1329092058657693699 2020-11-19 00:00:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Let's review:  1. Circumstantial evidence is evidence. 2. Witness testimony is evidence. 3. Lack of transparency is evidence.  So, every time someone tells you you have "no evidence" they are either flat ignorant or lying.
1329088752136818704 2020-11-18 23:47:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL Warnock is a fruitcake. Ossoff at least presents well.
1329088567088353281 2020-11-18 23:46:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DKaiserjager Warnock is definitely weaker than Loeffler is relatively speaking. I think it will end up being close either way.
1329087277159444487 2020-11-18 23:41:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Georgia runoff is kind of funny: Warnock is the weaker Democrat and Loeffler is the weaker Republican. If you reversed the matchup, it would basically be certain to end up 1 D, 1 R with Perdue beating Warnock and Ossoff beating Loeffler.
1329086954877534208 2020-11-18 23:39:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Because he is a political candidate and ACB was an appointee.

1329085938635399169 2020-11-18 23:35:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I love how these neocons think they can snatch back the GOP when the GOP is bigger than it has ever been.
1329083409444966400 2020-11-18 23:25:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @warpfactor13 If it goes anything like the Georgia recount, we might find that thousands of Trump votes were simply missed.
1329081742578249739 2020-11-18 23:19:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> When he says “no evidence,” btw, he actually means it. No one in the upper echelons of the Democratic Party even accused the Russians of doing this.
1329080616248217603 2020-11-18 23:14:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf When I worked with the Ron Paul Camp, we took control of a county party in a county with about 350K people. Was fun.
1329080178325082123 2020-11-18 23:13:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Your local Republican Party is partially responsible for enforcing fair elections in your jurisdiction. We can all help get a fair, honest election by taking control of local GOPs.
1329079783129378818 2020-11-18 23:11:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf State delegate is ridiculously easy unless you're in a big GOP county.   Electing your own County Chairman takes a bit longer, but if it takes you more than two years, you're doing it wrong.
1329079131242340359 2020-11-18 23:08:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Take control of your local Republican Party. This can mostly be done by showing up.
1329076412418990081 2020-11-18 22:58:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @5gentexan Why does a county judge think they get to express political opinions?
1329075576108249088 2020-11-18 22:54:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Liberals: Land doesn't vote!  Also liberals: Hahaha....we have more of duh GDP than you Trumpers.

1329072973186154498 2020-11-18 22:44:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> What if I told you I don't trust "reputable sources"?

1329071971590664198 2020-11-18 22:40:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden This is one reason why I think a Trump Term 2 will tend to be better. Even if that comes about Grover Cleveland style: Perhaps even more so if it comes about Grover Cleveland style.
1328933403547332610 2020-11-18 13:29:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky @nguyenthevote I’ve worked on several campaigns and even have one on my resume (Ron Paul 2012). Helped seize control of a large county’s GOP while we were at it.
1328932429109846016 2020-11-18 13:25:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tfamilyfriend @SirDowden @SelimSeesYou Lol. The main ones that got me were the Church leaders. I’m like: What do you think it means to ban abortion, moron?
1328932216471162889 2020-11-18 13:25:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Truth_Reaction @SelimSeesYou The left is the agent of degeneration and decay. It is always easier to destroy than to build.
1328931630053023748 2020-11-18 13:22:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @SelimSeesYou I’ll never forget late March 2016 when he said that if illegal, abortion should be punished and all the pro-life and Big Eva grifters came out and said that was the “wrong tone.”
1328930052889833473 2020-11-18 13:16:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trutsle Maybe he can lose races there too!   I like Kobach, but apparently the man is a flawed candidate. Though, Kansas may not be the best fit for him.
1328928094523154434 2020-11-18 13:08:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nguyenthevote @RyanGirdusky Going door to door just isn’t an effective method of reaching these people. You mostly reach the disinterested ones through organic outreach: “Hey, hear about this Trump guy? He wants to build a wall, sounds cool.”
1328927425556844547 2020-11-18 13:06:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky If Trump hasn’t engaged someone, then they don’t want to be engaged at this point. He’s literally everywhere. A lot of the people in this group you are referring don’t even have political beliefs beyond “politicians bad.”
1328924793278783488 2020-11-18 12:55:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky Ryan, you're talking about a group of people that just doesn't vote and never has historically. Trump got an historic number of the ones who do infrequently vote to the polls. It's the law of diminishing returns you're running into, not bad turnout drives.
1328924053869047808 2020-11-18 12:52:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nguyenthevote @RyanGirdusky @SirDowden The idea the Trump camp didn't make a concerted effort to register new voters just isn't born out by the data. He got at least 73.2 million votes: That's an amazing turnout increase.
1328923658291654656 2020-11-18 12:51:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nguyenthevote @RyanGirdusky @SirDowden 1. That is a perfectly normal drop off. Some of those people probably don't even live in the State of Georgia anymore. We have no way of knowing they ever would have voted Trump anyway. 2. Most of those people don't want to be registered.
1328923036406468611 2020-11-18 12:48:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky It has nothing to do with my standards. You're sitting out there flat misrepresenting stuff like the Platinum Plan and giving credence to all sorts to dispirit portions of Trump's base. Of course Trump ain't perfect, but October wasn't the time to publicly criticize it.
1328922532351717382 2020-11-18 12:46:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky First of all, that isn't a British flag. Secondly, I've lost personal friends over Trump too. Been laughed at by people at Church like I was some kind of idiot. This is just what all of us outspoken early Trumpers experienced. Not all of us got a book deal out of it.
1328920742550003713 2020-11-18 12:39:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky @SirDowden Who are these people you are talking about? Trump got more votes basically anywhere there were more votes to be had. The number of Obama-&gt;Trump-&gt;Biden voters was incredibly minimal. Statistical noise. In Georgia, the man got 350K more votes. Who else was he supposed to drag out?
1328919638680416258 2020-11-18 12:35:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden I think the better framing for our struggle is the Country vs. Court Party struggle of 18th Century British politics. We are the party of the Country and they are the party of a hostile, often seemingly foreign, elite Court in the metros.
1328919155601514499 2020-11-18 12:33:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden One reason populist movements tend to peter out over time is they are generally focused on achieving one particular goal or a small set of goals. Once that is accomplished, they have no reason to exist. There's no real principle involved. 1/2
1328917666657165312 2020-11-18 12:27:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Charlemagne_03 @bronzeagemantis Trump is head of state and is so until he relinquishes the task. He should protect it.
1328916412119855105 2020-11-18 12:22:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden The antics of the emerging Populist, Inc. set have been bizarre to me the past month and a half. Just constant sniping.
1328914439521902593 2020-11-18 12:14:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Imagine what kind of corrupt person you'd have to be to not find anything sacred and reject loyalty as a virtue.
1328913075597139969 2020-11-18 12:09:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I have thought of this passage of Scripture many times as I reflect on the corruption that our nation has experienced over the years:  https://t.co/NgLy3iR4zP via @biblegateway

1328911661756018688 2020-11-18 12:03:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden North Georgia showed some slight Trump regression. Enough to be the difference. However, two of three counties that found missing Trump votes were in North Georgia (the other was an Atlanta suburb). It was mostly insane turnout in the Atlanta burbs, though.
1328909973804421122 2020-11-18 11:56:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If we can somehow take out a few BigLaw firms while we're at it, that would be hilarious.
1328909490700374017 2020-11-18 11:54:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden Trump has gotten 36K more votes in Brooklyn. Most of that is probably heightened Ultra Orthodox turnout.
1328908686383869952 2020-11-18 11:51:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> White male Democrats who aren't pols are the saddest creatures on the planet.
1328907690207227904 2020-11-18 11:47:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Duke_Libertas Like I said, I hope they win, but after his sniping at Trump all they way up to election eve, it's really rich to see this guy in the tank for two standard issue RNC Senators.
1328906077497397248 2020-11-18 11:41:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Girdusky shilling for Loeffler and Perdue is just disgusting. Like, I hope they win their races, but coming from this guy it's really rich.
1328904165041573888 2020-11-18 11:33:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnAdamsTrue @NRxAuthors I'm honestly not going to hold it against them personally. These are just ordinary people who were trying to do their civic duty and got assaulted by every global media outlet within minutes of standing up.
1328903596763656194 2020-11-18 11:31:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NRxAuthors @JohnAdamsTrue Risky move, but I kind of like the idea of waiting to see who your real friends are and then pouncing.
1328903320921059331 2020-11-18 11:30:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnAdamsTrue @NRxAuthors Likely allies of Rick Snyder, a NeverTrumper, so I'm not sure how much stock I'd put in them.

1328894886561656832 2020-11-18 10:56:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnAdamsTrue And the people who are in charge of enforcing the rules are themselves the beneficiaries of this fraud.
1328894598656167936 2020-11-18 10:55:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnAdamsTrue The American election system is so thoroughly corrupt it's mind-boggling. What we are witnessing is an alignment of all of those forms of corruption into one giant mass of fraud so big it's difficult to understand how truly large it is. Won't convince me otherwise at this point.
1328893927894749186 2020-11-18 10:52:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law They do it even when they don't need to do so just to get away with it when they do.
1328893267761635334 2020-11-18 10:50:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnAdamsTrue It’s probably just standard practice. Even when they done need to do it, they do it just to get away with it when they do.
1328892282116972551 2020-11-18 10:46:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It isn't a legal decision as it was done under duress. Trump needs to take strong action now.
1328891978453573632 2020-11-18 10:45:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnAdamsTrue I don't even know if they could make such a condition binding. I'd certainly not vote that way until they conceded and did it.
1328891247822581762 2020-11-18 10:42:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal The GOP State Senate leader called Biden the "President-Elect" today. Wouldn't count on him.
1328890853511852032 2020-11-18 10:40:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnbourbon98 It does work and it seems the only effective response is to short circuit the system for a while and just go fash.
1328889683363893248 2020-11-18 10:36:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnbourbon98 Don't even know what to do here. We're dealing with an enemy that resorts to lawlessness at the first breath and while our side does very little about it.
1328889329427623937 2020-11-18 10:34:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal Sounds like cave.
1328888846004662275 2020-11-18 10:32:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal Yes.
1328888619428409346 2020-11-18 10:31:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So: Wayne certified it on condition of an audit of absentees. No idea what this means.
1328887891897044993 2020-11-18 10:28:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 None. This is all highly irregular.
1328887810900844546 2020-11-18 10:28:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 Yes, hold on for that.
1328887407937265666 2020-11-18 10:27:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 Basically, Philly and Pittsburgh (and perhaps others) mixed all these ballots together against the orders of Justice Alito and so now they're all just mixed in together and no one really knows how many there are.
1328887198746349569 2020-11-18 10:26:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 There's multiple cases in Pennsylvania. The one you are talking about are the late arriving, no postmark ballots. Of which, there are at least 10,000 (virtually all for Biden), but no one knows the exact number because of the other case about lack of vote observation.
1328886052950593537 2020-11-18 10:21:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I've never seen a recount this lopsided and when they are, they're usually for Democrats. Ballots in trunks weeks later sort of thin.
1328885282016473090 2020-11-18 10:18:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Raffensperger and Kemp trying to blame a random county elections officials for their poor choice of elections program is really rich. Asking him to resign? LMAO.
1328884490958147586 2020-11-18 10:15:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Me, a monarchist: Do I dare get my hopes up?
1328882594067460096 2020-11-18 10:07:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Not as bad a miss as AR-2 being a "tossup" and French Hill winning by.....more than 11 points.
1328881743076667396 2020-11-18 10:04:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 No. She's abusing her power and the law. A criminal, in other words. Woman is sick in the head.
1328880649453916164 2020-11-18 10:00:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This woman is a criminal and belongs in federal prison.
1328880434118348804 2020-11-18 09:59:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So here's how this went down: They guesstimated how many votes they'd need. While checking off people that didn't vote, they miscounted how many they needed to mark as voting. So now we have a discrepancy.
1328879956659761153 2020-11-18 09:57:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I told you guys 2018 was likely the nadir of the California Republican Party. That much seems certain now.
1328879178981183488 2020-11-18 09:54:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CoolAidsMan4 @FatalityMail To be fair, this was probably owned by some incompetent minority criminal who was as liable to kill himself as someone else if he ever used the thing.
1328878795881934848 2020-11-18 09:52:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JenFarkas2 @RealAPolitics Theoretically a candidate could come in a very close second in both districts, but lead statewide.
1328878474174533634 2020-11-18 09:51:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 I love Timmie's.

1328876869161267201 2020-11-18 09:45:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Oh, no, we're racist guys. Time to pack it in.
1328874824773623810 2020-11-18 09:37:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 It's for the good of the city, after all.   Tim Keller is such a snake.
1328874244458024961 2020-11-18 09:34:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nc_groyp @SelimSeesYou I muted him months ago. Dude does nothing but blackpill all day. It's his market. Some people legit love being blackpilled.
1328873207802327048 2020-11-18 09:30:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou There's a growing Populist, Inc. grifter group developing. Going to be as bad as Con, Inc. ever was. Unfortunately Tucker is in this group.
1328871203671568385 2020-11-18 09:22:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Honest opinion: Everyone is guilty of confirmation bias at this point because our system is so rigged you can never really know what's fair and what isn't. We just don't have legitimate elections. No way to ascertain legitimate votes from illegitimate ones.
1328869497500020741 2020-11-18 09:15:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @attyzachmiller @Barnes_Law Perhaps it could be a condition of voting absentee when you have good cause to do so.
1328869232390639624 2020-11-18 09:14:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Republicans: The party of the natural aristocracy.  Democrats: The party of the natural slave.

1328866591287685121 2020-11-18 09:04:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @attyzachmiller @Barnes_Law Simple answer: In person voting at a secure location.
1328865611108274177 2020-11-18 09:00:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If 2020 has taught you anything, it should be that Aristotelian natural slaves are a real category.
1328865342928674817 2020-11-18 08:59:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @GladstonianLib That I can at least get.
1328865262133796867 2020-11-18 08:59:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GladstonianLib @realikamusume I don't know. My government boss was telling me that she was socially distancing from her own son (who lives at home) a month ago. Like, wtf is wrong with these people? How can you be so slavish?
1328864808767283203 2020-11-18 08:57:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OnlineXtians I detect no lies.
1328863870253981696 2020-11-18 08:53:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Thamer72663870 Tonight, just enjoy the winning.
1328861719352004609 2020-11-18 08:44:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Bill ain't going to have anywhere left to run when this is over. Not even Israel will take this sucker.
1328859604206424066 2020-11-18 08:36:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm looking forward to finding out how much they bribed the Georgia Secretary of State to help cover up the steal.
1328858109079670785 2020-11-18 08:30:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jamesdkclark I take a very strong view of it myself, as should be obvious from my handle, but then there's the totally slavish view some have.
1328857571311169536 2020-11-18 08:28:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm waiting for someone to tell me Romans 13 means I have to do this.
1328855884152365056 2020-11-18 08:21:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jandrusk Good. Full scorched earth now.

1328852955437600770 2020-11-18 08:10:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realDonaldTrump Thank you, Mr. President, for exercising your constitutional duty to remove corrupt government officials.
1328852001397018627 2020-11-18 08:06:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Also: How many of the names crossed off didn't actually vote?
1328851807364403200 2020-11-18 08:05:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dang Wayne County can't even stuff a freaking box right. SMDH.
1328851146765643783 2020-11-18 08:02:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Thamer72663870 If they do allow it to stand, I want to read the opinion. They'd have to be incredibly precise to not turn our elections into complete shams.
1328850698461728770 2020-11-18 08:01:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @virginiabelle76 That's usually the case if a Democrat wins Michigan by less than 8 points or so.
1328849790768197632 2020-11-18 07:57:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Michigan is also big because it has the largest margin of the states in dispute in terms of both percentage and raw votes. If that one can get thrown out, very good precedent.
1328849481400524806 2020-11-18 07:56:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis Besides the completely expected PA ruling, literally nothing bad happened all day.
1328848420849725445 2020-11-18 07:52:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We may be gettin' Michigan back, boys.
1328844250218438664 2020-11-18 07:35:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Michigan: Lets create a law where every county needs a bipartisan group to agree to certify results of an election. Should check fraud.  Democrats later: HOW DARE YOU REPUBLICANS QUESTION THE RESULTS!!!
1328843394903379970 2020-11-18 07:32:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThePotenciado @TymesDark @DjJon75 @michpoligal I always love when you arrogant pricks act like a grammatical error or spelling mistake negates the substance of a statement. This is Twitter, not an academic board.
1328843133573095424 2020-11-18 07:31:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @CarlStein1984 Apparently it's state law in Michigan all counties have a 2-2 board of canvassers.
1328842877150093315 2020-11-18 07:30:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IH28284922 @DjJon75 @michpoligal This person legit wants them "investigated" like the canvassers committed some kind of crime by doing their job and saying they think the results are suspect in some manner. Why have a bipartisan board of canvassers if they can't look into results they find suspect?
1328842372017516547 2020-11-18 07:28:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Big for Senate too.
1328841644121141249 2020-11-18 07:25:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 Regardless it gives the Trump team ammo. It's clearly a partisan result, but the fact the Republicans even had the balls to do it in Detroit is significant.
1328841143115796481 2020-11-18 07:23:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 I’m unsure.
1328839806999261196 2020-11-18 07:17:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LudicrousHilar1 @realikamusume Especially when the Canvassers are 2-2 R-D.
1328839639138971650 2020-11-18 07:17:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @beemorgs @DjJon75 @michpoligal I see you know everything. What is the mystery of life? Can you tell me you secrets?
1328839421911822341 2020-11-18 07:16:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Yes.
1328839371605340164 2020-11-18 07:16:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DjJon75 @michpoligal Apparently good ones.
1328839247349026817 2020-11-18 07:15:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> How is the Wayne County Board of Canvassers 2-2 Republican-Democrat? Is it required by state law or something?
1328838417128562699 2020-11-18 07:12:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DjJon75 @michpoligal On what grounds?
1328838239462035456 2020-11-18 07:11:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 👀
1328837695402094593 2020-11-18 07:09:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Will check it out.
1328837216999763968 2020-11-18 07:07:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou What's up with the Dutch choosing Wawa? Like, who goes "Wawa" when asked about food chains?
1328836997520232456 2020-11-18 07:06:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I have never once went a Checker's since I've moved to an area they exist.
1328829008151273474 2020-11-18 06:34:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Watch this county further cut into the Biden lead in the state. Or maybe Dominion is further printing Biden ballots as they realized they shit the bed on this.
1328828535935557636 2020-11-18 06:33:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK They were the ones conducting the "audit."
1328828258075422720 2020-11-18 06:31:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DaldorenGaming He brings the block down pretty quick.
1328828059760386052 2020-11-18 06:31:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @rwg4302 Georgia seems to be staffed by a band of traitors or utter morons.
1328827383730868224 2020-11-18 06:28:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @rwg4302 If that. It will likely be incumbent Harris vs. Progressive challenger in the 2024 primaries. Trump should run again because of how much of a cakewalk it will be. All we need to do is secure a fair election process in the swing states and we're gold.
1328826407762485256 2020-11-18 06:24:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Angerville9 "Joined November 2020" 0 followers. LMAO.
1328826250903908352 2020-11-18 06:24:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If Biden gets in, the Democrats will basically be in a state of civil war for the next four years.
1328825491218960384 2020-11-18 06:21:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Kenosha bucked its bellwether status in Wisconsin and they're claiming that is also because of the riots shifting them towards Trump. Which one is it? Do the riots hurt them or help them?
1328825162616217606 2020-11-18 06:19:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Angerville9 The votes should be properly audited. As should all Pennsylvania mail ins. Your lack of transparency is itself evidence of criminal intent.
1328822269297258498 2020-11-18 06:08:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Hello, I'm an American liberal. I'm going to tell you about how Americans are worse at everything compared to Europe and Canada, except elections. We do those much better. Because White Supremacy or something.
1328821717112938504 2020-11-18 06:06:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Talk about posting your Ls online.
1328820032432910336 2020-11-18 05:59:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Ok, we will just ignore the 1250 net Trump votes the machines hid.
1328819171073855490 2020-11-18 05:55:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "Election fraud never happens."
1328816941734227976 2020-11-18 05:47:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Get owned. Keep this up, McCarthy, and I may just like you.
1328815890532622336 2020-11-18 05:42:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Not just flip, but probably flip by a margin similar to 2016. Maybe one or two point regression.
1328813972875743232 2020-11-18 05:35:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is the most suspect election already. We've never had a recount overturn more than a thousand vote lead. 1300 votes for Trump just found that weren't even counted, the auditor switching votes, etc. All of this is enough to warrant throwing out the results.
1328813394254835713 2020-11-18 05:32:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theeternalright I'm talking about rallies, marches, townhalls, increased activism from the right. I was a passivist, but we're really reaching critical mass here regardless of outcome and that's the time to make your warfare conventional.
1328812979597561860 2020-11-18 05:31:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Two counties in Georgia. More votes have already been found for Trump than in the history of recounts.
1328812659605708810 2020-11-18 05:30:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theeternalright I don't think they'll be able to do anything like abolish the electoral college, get an AWB through, etc. The people will be too restless.
1328812348568694785 2020-11-18 05:28:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theeternalright I honestly think Trump should go nuclear if he doesn't win the battle here, but the enemy simply doesn't have enough power. The Great Reset will be a Great Failure and leave them incredibly vulnerable. The Dems will be in utter disarray and we will only grow stronger.
1328811140282003462 2020-11-18 05:23:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theeternalright You can't give up if there's a setback. It's not an option. I agree it will make the task more difficult, but we can secure a free and fair election in 2024. It's not impossible.
1328802910361235463 2020-11-18 04:51:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 That's when we'll know we have to go full Caesar, to be honest.
1328802246696513539 2020-11-18 04:48:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Let's hold an election by mail, not check the signatures, reject hardly any ballots, and then when someone ask questions tell them redress is impossible because we already screwed them over.  This is what many consider "justice" now.
1328800432123162624 2020-11-18 04:41:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I want to fight this out so we get the women after the victory parade.
1328800183925215235 2020-11-18 04:40:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The corrupt Pennsylvania Supreme Court rules that they are not, in fact, corrupt. Cites their own selves. This is government now.
1328799722149195778 2020-11-18 04:38:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's literally this guy's job to secure election integrity and he goes behind the back of the state legislature to enact a "consent decree" that limits enforcement of their laws. What kind of government is this?
1328799270506557443 2020-11-18 04:36:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Georgia Secretary of State should be voted out for no other reason than his lax standards on mail in voting.
1328796729756569600 2020-11-18 04:26:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @radiationorgan Ok, so he's just solid. Definitely a solid dark horse to back if no one else is good in the stable of candidates.
1328795925205180416 2020-11-18 04:23:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I try to exist simultaneously in the land of the normies and the land of the reactionaries.
1328795163171418116 2020-11-18 04:20:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @radiationorgan He solid on immigration? Seems he’s solid on everything else.
1328794916936437760 2020-11-18 04:19:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL Oh, I have to work with them on the daily, so don’t remind me. I’m literally going to quit if Biden gets in. I won’t be able to take it.
1328794723088297984 2020-11-18 04:18:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So, this guy is kind of my guy: He’s a millionaire tech guy who spends his spare time hunting and contributing to YECist research. His views on retirement seem a bit extreme, though.
1328794224238718977 2020-11-18 04:16:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL Lawyers at least understand the public holds them in contempt. Academics are begrudgingly respected by many, even if they think too highly of themselves. So I think not. Especially considering journos are basically failed lawyers or academics.
1328792859122786306 2020-11-18 04:11:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @barf_captain It's so convenient, isn't it?
1328791453376671744 2020-11-18 04:05:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JurisNaturalism @JayFiveK It's why I won't get down regardless. We're building something here and the only thing that will let them win in the end is letting them.
1328789763441168384 2020-11-18 03:59:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Georgia Secretary of State is trying to save his own hide from conducting a real audit. There's always a small percentage of drop offs. For all we know, some of these people moved or died.
1328788883589488642 2020-11-18 03:55:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume This isn't a crazy large number. There's always random dropoffs between the Primary and GE.
1328784198530965504 2020-11-18 03:36:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK If we had a reasonable electorate, Trump would have won by like 10 points in 2016. 20 in 2020. This was stolen, but if we had a more reasonable electorate that wouldn't have even been vaguely possible. Just look at Naomi Wolf complaining about lockdowns and Biden. Low info.
1328776097597632513 2020-11-18 03:04:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BatteryFive DeSantis definitely has a lot of strategic advantages. Basically securing Florida is a big win. If Trump doesn't pull this off, I still think the best chance for the movement is a Trump 2024. If he does pull it off, Pence will be such a favorite in the primaries it's absurd.
1328774529079005188 2020-11-18 02:58:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis Yeah, I think she has too much baggage overall. Probably not a smart pick. I would like it personally, though.
1328774327018381315 2020-11-18 02:57:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BatteryFive Her lifetime record from NumbersUSA is 53%. That's pretty bad for a GOP Member. A lot of that is from her final 2-3 years when GOP members were getting a lot of heat from the Trump Camp on it too.
1328774056074760192 2020-11-18 02:56:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BatteryFive To be fair, this sounds like a normal South Dakotan.
1328773486249119744 2020-11-18 02:54:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BatteryFive Lots of GOP governors resisted that stuff, so her record is suspect and she hasn't said much else.
1328773274189393926 2020-11-18 02:53:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis Would vote for this ticket.
1328773160863457283 2020-11-18 02:53:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 She volunteered for thousands of refugees to flood Sioux Falls.
1328772638811037697 2020-11-18 02:50:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> No, Sarah Palin had a hardline stance on immigration. One reason her appearance on the ticket with McCain was so weird.
1328771769638006790 2020-11-18 02:47:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> LMAO. No source. Here's what happened, if anything: Trump jokes "we can always nuke them."   Pompeo says, "No, no, that's a bad idea, Mr. President."  Trump responds, "Of course not, have a little fun, Mike."
1328770815911931911 2020-11-18 02:43:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Every time this guy does something cool, he retracts it.
1328768873282347009 2020-11-18 02:36:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @politicsmaps @RedEaglePatriot My point isn't that it proves anything, but it basically messes up everything we know about trends and voting groups. These voters aren't that different.
1328768609741627393 2020-11-18 02:34:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @politicsmaps @RedEaglePatriot Mahoning County flipped for Trump. It's basically the same place as Erie County. Cleveland suburbs were stable for Trump. Ashtabula is literally right next to Erie and swing 5 points towards him. These aren't normal trends.
1328767842309824513 2020-11-18 02:31:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Also, how long it takes New York to count votes and the number of estimated votes out is absolutely absurd two weeks out from an election. Simply unacceptable.
1328767284266020864 2020-11-18 02:29:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump's probably going to double his vote total in The Bronx if the number of votes outstanding are to believed and he gets any of them.
1328766978715213830 2020-11-18 02:28:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GabeGuidarini @RedEaglePatriot Also, Trump got more votes in every Borough already and the population has shrunk there. Unsure where these miraculous Biden votes will come from.
1328766357236756484 2020-11-18 02:26:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GabeGuidarini @RedEaglePatriot "I just don't see how upstate New York...."
1328766036280287238 2020-11-18 02:24:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GabeGuidarini @RedEaglePatriot Most of upstate is.
1328764952216268800 2020-11-18 02:20:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> That's totally normal, sure.
1328763796039618560 2020-11-18 02:15:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Literally banana republic tier stuff.
1328763546893770757 2020-11-18 02:14:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Precinct level data.  That's it. That's the Tweet.
1328763008303190023 2020-11-18 02:12:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot I just don't see how upstate New York and Ohio swing so far right while Pennsylvania goes with Biden. Makes no sense.
1328762484577202177 2020-11-18 02:10:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roland_Gunn2 Hopefully it last more than a 100 days, but I feel like this moment is what the Trump 2024 Campaign would feel like if Biden gets into office.
1328759251490250755 2020-11-18 01:57:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume They know what side their bread is buttered on at this point.
1328755425152540674 2020-11-18 01:42:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @real_1776 Radically changing our compensation structure for healthcare effectively makes it government healthcare. Government will mandate costs, etc. I’m not a free market absolutist, but systemic price controls like what it appears Japan does are just bad policy.
1328754419035484160 2020-11-18 01:38:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @real_1776 Going too far towards government healthcare will create an even worse dichotomy because what will happen is the very rich will end up leaving the country for their healthcare in territories that have effectively private healthcare. This is what wealthy Euros do.
1328754015325327360 2020-11-18 01:36:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @real_1776 I’m more in favor of plugging gaps in the existing system than total revolution. The American healthcare system is the most innovative in the world. Part of the reason it is the most expensive. I don’t want to give that up.
1328752395942301697 2020-11-18 01:30:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @real_1776 I'm unfamiliar with the Japanese healthcare system. I have long thought American laws on paid leave are absurd and need reform, though. Our people need a vacation. Assisted childcare: I worry how this affects housewives.
1328751745741164545 2020-11-18 01:27:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These people will not be achieving total power regardless of what happens. Do I believe all the stops should be pulled from preventing Biden from taking office? Yes, absolutely, my position on this cannot be clearer, but I'm not going to go away under any circumstances.
1328751025545736192 2020-11-18 01:25:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @togreatness777 @realikamusume Oh, I see, you're just going to surrender if they win this time. Pathetic. Napoleon had to be put on a tiny rock in the middle of the Atlantic to give up his dreams.
1328750013959315457 2020-11-18 01:21:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @radiationorgan I'd rather they not even get an opportunity, but I just don't think their plan is a viable one.
1328749725819023360 2020-11-18 01:19:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @real_1776 I'm in favor of expanding certain government programs a la Bismarkian conservatism, but full leftist plans like universal healthcare, arbitrary wealth caps, etc. are non-starters. They aren't even that popular.
1328749137467240448 2020-11-18 01:17:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @togreatness777 @realikamusume GOP controls many state legislatures. Show up to townhalls. Organize friends. Send letters. Secure a free and fair election in 2022 and 2024 and we can win a true landslide with a complete mandate.
1328748823540273154 2020-11-18 01:16:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @togreatness777 @realikamusume Your attitude is one of defeatism. There are always setbacks. ALWAYS. That occurs for them as much as us. The only way they win is if you surrender, which is basically what you are suggesting. Never surrender. Until they put us in camps and execute us, there's hope.
1328747341029969921 2020-11-18 01:10:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @togreatness777 @realikamusume That's extremely flawed thinking on their part if we keep the pressure on regardless.
1328746635426467844 2020-11-18 01:07:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @togreatness777 @realikamusume It's the point, but they risk a ton right now. They really don't have the mandate they wanted to do much. If Biden forces a depression, it could prove fatal to the regime. Things don't happen in a vacuum and they're not omnipotent.
1328745553103085568 2020-11-18 01:03:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume It’s a serious gamble on the part of the ruling class.
1328745364996972547 2020-11-18 01:02:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theeternalright It was merely a nice side effect.
1328743754925268993 2020-11-18 00:56:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Maybe we just give this shitshow to Biden to laugh when it blows up. It's a viable strategy, if risky and ending ugly.
1328742162650030082 2020-11-18 00:49:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedeemedCat There are always exploits.
1328741711430946819 2020-11-18 00:48:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark Not every country is so easily cowed as Westerners these days.
1328738885527023620 2020-11-18 00:36:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ItalianGroyper1 @SelbJim People make money in different ways. Trump has made most of his billions by building things: An actually productive activity. He also has a brand he sells, but it complements that rather than supplants it. Most of these billionaires are just really good at cooking books.
1328735933110292482 2020-11-18 00:25:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The sharp divide between the metros and the country needs to be addressed. As a firm member of the Country Party (one of the old names for the English Tories), I obviously would like this settled in favor of the country.
1328734337269977094 2020-11-18 00:18:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 Eh, most of these folks don’t actually care. There could easily be a two tiered system: An area for authorized partisan challenger, and then a few feet behind them where any random bloke can sit there and watch them.
1328733216061218820 2020-11-18 00:14:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just don’t understand why any interested observer can’t go and watch the votes being counted. Like, why do you even need credentials? I trust random cranks to enforce the rules.
1328731138614042624 2020-11-18 00:06:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Now that their evil creature that spread porn and social isolation has achieved its goals and is now turning against them, time to ban it.
1328729549908144129 2020-11-17 23:59:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 What Biden has done and what he intends to do is uglier.
1328729337277853698 2020-11-17 23:58:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @real_1776 Most of the people who are advocating that stuff live in Metros themselves. Girdusky, Carlson, etc. all live in major metros and are basing their beliefs on flawed polling numbers less so than being in touch with any constituency. They're basically PMCs themselves.
1328728888869064704 2020-11-17 23:57:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnAdamsTrue @TLCB2006 Kemp is definitely a bad actor. Not sure how responsible he is for the SoS's actions, though. States have different standards on whether the executive officers are independent of gubernatorial authority or not. Lots of states lack unitary executives.
1328728140261314560 2020-11-17 23:54:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnAdamsTrue @TLCB2006 That would be the Secretary of State that entered into the decree. Not sure how that vacancy is filled in Georgia TBH.
1328727760026656769 2020-11-17 23:52:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnAdamsTrue @TLCB2006 That consent decree was ridiculous. He should be impeached.
1328727498868350976 2020-11-17 23:51:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TLCB2006 We do have SCOTUS.
1328727221171875840 2020-11-17 23:50:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @uhhhhhhhhhhhuh Our allegations are:  1. They were illegally connected to the internet. 2. Some may have been locally manipulated.
1328726992058003456 2020-11-17 23:49:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TLCB2006 You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.
1328726904388640769 2020-11-17 23:49:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnAdamsTrue @TLCB2006 I understand what you mean, but you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take, so to speak.
1328725781363777536 2020-11-17 23:44:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TLCB2006 Stop this defeatism. Pressure your state legislature to pass better laws. Pressure Congress.
1328725502983598084 2020-11-17 23:43:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @uhhhhhhhhhhhuh We didn’t say it was impossible. We just said Russia didn’t do it and there was no evidence that Russia did. Nor was it even alleged by anyone on the Dem legal team. Just because one country didn’t do it doesn’t mean another couldn’t.
1328725130042875904 2020-11-17 23:42:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Voter ID, strict rules on mail ins, regular cleaning of the voter rolls, etc. are all the norm in most Western democracies.
1328724840925290496 2020-11-17 23:41:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All Republicans are asking in this country is that we run our elections like basically every other country in the Western World.
1328723729480896512 2020-11-17 23:36:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If I tweet out anything that suggests contingency plans: All I’m saying is every setback must be turned to opportunity.
1328723510764695554 2020-11-17 23:35:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @real_1776 Democrats are basically limited to Metros at this point and Metro outposts. AKA bughives. This is a slim portion of the state in Kentucky. They do exist in the rust belt states (Philly, Dane, and Detroit).
1328722949914959873 2020-11-17 23:33:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 To reiterate my position: I don’t think Trump should concede under any circumstances, even if it means tearing the country apart.
1328722582770749441 2020-11-17 23:32:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 No, absolutely not. I’m just saying there’s no reason to throw in the towel if we got setback this round. A lot of people think it’s over. We must be ready to turn any setback into opportunity.
1328721751090585604 2020-11-17 23:28:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Charlemagne_03 They’re so dumb I don’t believe their government can possibly last long. Like, their pure incompetence will be their undoing at this point.
1328721172050096128 2020-11-17 23:26:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> And, 4. This country has had several elections stolen and all of them have energized the ones that had it stolen from them.
1328720890461294592 2020-11-17 23:25:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m saying this so you all stay in the fight regardless of whether this gets proven in court:  1. The election could have been stolen and we can’t prove it in court. 2. There are a lot more of us than there were 4 years ago.  3. The next 4 years will present many opportunities.
1328719621680148480 2020-11-17 23:20:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @real_1776 Basically. The GOP got a lot more than usual in 2016 and 2020 in the rust belt. There were definitely Obama-&gt;Trump voters in 2016 that put him over the top, but that wasn’t what put him in real contention.
1328718005904269312 2020-11-17 23:13:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @real_1776 To be fair, Trump's gains there are primarily based on turnout increase among dispirited voters. Type of people who gave Reagan his 49 state landslide and haven't cared since (even if they're too young to have done so personally).
1328717201776533505 2020-11-17 23:10:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Anton56422519 You're right: Could be a misdirect on the part of Team Trump. Still, we're on the outside here looking in. They need to get something really going.
1328716814805831682 2020-11-17 23:09:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 We will just have to wait and see. I'm a patient guy, but the clock is ticking. Just is.
1328716255436664838 2020-11-17 23:06:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This Dominion stuff all seems too good to be true to me, but I generally trust Bongino, Powell, and some of the others reporting on it.
1328715757962858496 2020-11-17 23:04:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 Oh, yeah, he lost due to the Fontes crook margin, but he should have won 2016 and 2020 by larger margins.
1328715185763328001 2020-11-17 23:02:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 "Build the Wall" would have won the West circa 2000. If Trump ran his campaign in 1992-2000, he really could have shook up politics massively. I don't know what happened in Arizona. That should be their issue and that's why he won the GOP primary there so handily in 2016.
1328714178044043271 2020-11-17 22:58:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 True on both counts!
1328713906597015552 2020-11-17 22:57:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 Which Trump delivered on as much as can be reasonably expected.
1328712967660113920 2020-11-17 22:53:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump got 73 million votes and lost in the Rust Belt (if he lost). Rural Wisconsinites just aren't as concerned with immigrations as we are. I'd love to slash immigration, it's one of my top issues, but I recognize most people aren't me.
1328712596191653888 2020-11-17 22:52:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Fact check: No.   Also, Trump basically did institute a moratorium this year, the first year he possibly could have.
1328710305652871176 2020-11-17 22:43:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim Long run, yes. Today? No.
1328706251790934017 2020-11-17 22:27:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @UnbiasedData She's a serious attorney and she says she has evidence, so she should be given the benefit of the doubt until otherwise, but I understand what you mean.
1328705495071297536 2020-11-17 22:24:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Update on the day:  1. I'm not terribly optimistic about this Penn court case given that the attorneys chickened out. 2. Team Trump needs to start getting the Sydney Powell stuff out soon. Doesn't have to be today, but if it's not out this week it probably ain't coming out.

1328564576020017153 2020-11-17 13:04:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ElectionPage I get you, we're honest folks. At some point you're basically at war, though, and all's fair in love and war.

1328563672168472576 2020-11-17 13:00:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Team Trump needs to start dumping millions of hidden Trump mail ins throughout Georgia and the Rust Belt "Oh, look, here's a 100K Trump ballots you didn't count. They're totally legit I swear."
1328563199503978498 2020-11-17 12:58:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis At least he ain't gay.
1328562507796140037 2020-11-17 12:56:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou Man knows his business. He even thinks he underestimated Trump's strength. Just quite obvious from the vote total there was a sizable shy Trump factor. Not even the pro-Trump polls really predicted him getting over 73 million votes. They expected lower turnout.
1328561941107896321 2020-11-17 12:53:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan They were doing that last week. If I'm Team Trump, I guess I don't even care at this point because either they'll find relief in court or they won't.
1328561172682059778 2020-11-17 12:50:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Like, if you don't find this crap suspicious, you definitely chose correctly when you didn't go into detective work.
1328560913096601600 2020-11-17 12:49:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is getting ridiculous.
1328559337019764736 2020-11-17 12:43:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou The Seniors in Florida definitely stuck with Trump at similar margins to 2016. It is possible seniors in the rust belt did not do so. Baris did find that seniors in the rust belt weren't as Trump favorable as Florida seniors, but this is just the norm. They still broke Trump.
1328557963972403201 2020-11-17 12:37:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou It's kind of backed up by county level voting data: Hispanics definitely shifted towards Trump. Perhaps more than we suspected they would given some of the Texas returns. We'd need precinct level data to understand the data on rust belt seniors.
1328557634379722753 2020-11-17 12:36:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou Baris is livid. You can see it in his eyes every time he talks about it. Like, there's no reason for this complete lack of transparency. It's either incompetence or malfeasance, both of which throw the results into doubt with such tight margins.
1328557319903465472 2020-11-17 12:35:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou According to the information we have so far from exit polling, you'd expect 2024 to be a GOP landslide because the two groups that shifted against Trump were White men and seniors. Those folks will be back home in 2024 and the GOP isn't likely to lose among Hispanics.
1328556818352787456 2020-11-17 12:33:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou We still lack precinct level data, I suspect largely because it would show how ridiculous the whole story is. We need that data to do an actual autopsy of what happened, regardless of outcome. Like, we just have no idea where these votes are coming from. Also, the voter file.
1328549398050205696 2020-11-17 12:03:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou I honestly believe the fraud in PA was so massive and systemic we won't ever really know the full extent unless Sydney Powell comes through with the greatest prosecution in American history (global?). I want a full audit on all these mail ins in every county.
1328548823539572738 2020-11-17 12:01:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Love Laura. LMAO.

1328546404344750081 2020-11-17 11:52:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou That and I don't think we can ever really get to the bottom of. Similar story in Arizona and Nevada.
1328546087926456321 2020-11-17 11:50:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou It makes no dang sense. Those fracking comments should have killed any shot Biden ever had in PA. They had to go into crazy fraud overdrive to makeup for that crap.
1328545663878041602 2020-11-17 11:49:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou I did some rough calculations and 50K really seems like the right numbers in Wisconsin. 70-100K of Biden's votes just seem to have appeared from nowhere. Similar story in Penn.
1328544564676878337 2020-11-17 11:44:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou The narrative is that these other states were just more Democratic to start with, which I don't think anyone denies. But it's just really difficult for me to believe Trump flipped Mahoning and lost Erie. I mean, these places aren't even that far apart on a map.
1328544072173314048 2020-11-17 11:42:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou Well, two rust belt states maintained their Trump margins while the others rip Biden votes out their ass.

1328529073778384898 2020-11-17 10:43:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ori_Ar There's a way the Democrats can deny the GOP a majority of delegations. GOP should control 26, but the IA-2 race is very close. If it gets contested, GOP controls 25 and you need a majority of delegations. Theoretically, you could get a few GOP flips to Biden after deadlock.
1328527940183855104 2020-11-17 10:38:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Giselle84979969 I said somehow.
1328527613879611392 2020-11-17 10:37:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Donald Trump gets appointed Vice President and is confirmed by the Senate. Pence resigns with 1 year, 364 days left in the term. Trump gets 2.49 terms.
1328527041138978819 2020-11-17 10:35:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Election thrown to House and Senate. Somehow, house gives it to Biden while Senate gives it to Pence. Pence becomes President after invoking the 25th. Gays get completely owned.

1328526337003425793 2020-11-17 10:32:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnAdamsTrue @JayFiveK @SelimSeesYou The only one I can see possible is to attempt to get a tie in Iowa as the IA-2 race has the Republican leading by 47 votes. I could see them throwing that out somehow, that would still leave Trump with 25 delegations and deadlock ensues...
1328525325979045888 2020-11-17 10:28:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lauraka09619649 If it's God's Will, then that shall work itself out in court, I suppose, right?

1328524298244423680 2020-11-17 10:24:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lauraka09619649 Erickson has never really liked Trump and Erickson has always thought highly of himself. I got banned from RedState because once upon a time I supported Ron Paul (I didn't anymore when I joined). As far as I know, that's still a bannable offense.
1328523926725685248 2020-11-17 10:22:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnAdamsTrue @JayFiveK @SelimSeesYou She could, but I don't think there are enough relevant close races to overturn the results. The opponent would have to file a contest and then the Democrats would have to unite to shove through a sham rejection: Would be the most obviously corrupt rigging ever.
1328522390876336131 2020-11-17 10:16:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnAdamsTrue @JayFiveK @SelimSeesYou Well, it might actually be the best option for her. If the election gets thrown to the House, Trump wins with 26 Republican delegations in the new House.
1328522038944870404 2020-11-17 10:15:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnAdamsTrue @JayFiveK @SelimSeesYou It's a date appointed by Congress, and, therefore, it is a date Congress can change.

There's a second envelope they may be referring to called the "secrecy envelope" that is literally just a scrap of paper that protects the secrecy of the ballot and would be legally irrelevant.
1328521299522707457 2020-11-17 10:12:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnAdamsTrue @JayFiveK @SelimSeesYou It would depend on what the national scene looks like. If that happens in enough states, Congress could potentially move the date the electoral college meets and a redo could be held in those states. Other possibilities would include no electors and state legislature appointment.
1328519957123096578 2020-11-17 10:06:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnAdamsTrue @JayFiveK @SelimSeesYou In the Presidential race, you throw out the results entirely.
1328519405991583744 2020-11-17 10:04:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> BTW, this would apply to the Perdue Senate race as well.
1328519186327494661 2020-11-17 10:03:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnAdamsTrue @JayFiveK @SelimSeesYou No, there should be no way to connect a particular signature with a particular ballot otherwise the secret ballot is compromised. Not that it isn't already through the process of mail in voting, of course.
1328518405524164613 2020-11-17 10:00:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @SelimSeesYou He's right, but that's not an excuse for not conducting an audit. If the audit finds systemic problems with signature verification, then the election is thrown out. See the election result that was just thrown out in Nevada today.
1328517821907816448 2020-11-17 09:58:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roland_Gunn2 Pointless Congressional grandstanding against the evil opposition President is basically a pastime now.
1328517465857462273 2020-11-17 09:57:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp That, and you basically become a pawn of whoever the President is. Not as much room for parliamentary gamesmanship and kabuki theater.
1328516916642803712 2020-11-17 09:54:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think there's some kind of perverse incentive where the legislative party in a Presidential democracy wants to be the opposition. So, Congressional Republicans thrive when there's a Democrat President, etc.
1328516473925537794 2020-11-17 09:53:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan They buy media narratives when it suits their narrative and complain about them when they don't. I, an intellectual, reject all media narratives equally.

The extreme PopNats don't seem to have ever paid attention to Trump's campaign in the first place. They get mad at him for pursuing tax cuts when he literally gave a policy speech about it in 2016.

1328427336430198784 2020-11-17 03:58:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Can we finally take out Crist in 2022? I want that joker gone.
1328425483680223240 2020-11-17 03:51:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Regardless of what happens from here, yes.
1328424207424876545 2020-11-17 03:46:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BayouSzarvas Biden/Harris will be an utter disaster. Part of the reason we should pull out all the stops to prevent them from taking power to start. However, between 2022 and 2024, a Trumpist GOP can easily crush the Democrats. I think Trump himself is even capable of a comeback if he wants.
1328422432739352586 2020-11-17 03:39:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> “You believe Jesus is the Jewish Messiah? Anti-Semite! Clearly the same thing as Hitler.”
1328420895724089351 2020-11-17 03:33:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BayouSzarvas They already have the power to do this basically. It’s why I’m not going to just go home if we can’t pull this off. The opening in 2024 will be massive.
1328416551003971584 2020-11-17 03:16:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChiefTrumpster @SusanCollinsFan @RedEaglePatriot "I'm a fan of putting my finger in the wind and doing whatever the fake polls tell me to do."
1328414600166051840 2020-11-17 03:08:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m hearing this around Twitter. I have nothing special to add.
1328414525843009537 2020-11-17 03:07:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Hearing there might be some big court stuff going down tomorrow.
1328413904947572740 2020-11-17 03:05:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @radiationorgan They still showed up to vote in record numbers across the board, though. I’m just not sure how much more juice there is to squeeze here. At least not in the 2020 environment.
1328412535175966720 2020-11-17 03:00:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If Trump did get a lower share of non-college White vote, this was driven entirely by increased turnout over 2016. It was not from many genuine flips. Trump simply got more votes across the board.
1328411625930584064 2020-11-17 02:56:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GranTorinoDSA If there were any Obama-Trump-Biden, they were extremely few and far between. Trump just simply got more votes than he did last time even in these places. The new Biden votes are driven almost entirely by turnout increase, even assuming they’re legit.
1328408223100133378 2020-11-17 02:42:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed My favorite is 1974 New Hampshire Senate, separated by 2 votes. They just decided to opt for a rerun.
1328406305539842052 2020-11-17 02:35:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot @RealAPolitics There's a lot more unexplained glitches than normal this year and odd ones, at that.
1328405091641122825 2020-11-17 02:30:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 104 votes separate Mike Garcia and Christie Smith in CA-25. If you think that's close, 47 votes separate the candidates in IA-2.
1328399957745938432 2020-11-17 02:10:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @freshpseudonym I just regret that it has come to this.
1328399488780824576 2020-11-17 02:08:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These people are going to make me, a conservative, want to go full wealth redistributionist if they succeed in their goals. Just pillage everything from Amazon and give to people to rebuild their lives they had stolen from them.
1328398982431862787 2020-11-17 02:06:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Translation from political leaders globally: I'm really looking forward to destroying the small, family owned businesses of my country and giving that wealth to a small set of massive corporations owned by the billionaire set.
1328396789494542337 2020-11-17 01:57:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These people can't even manage good production value at this point. Looks like your class president decided to announce the "great reset."
1328396493569585153 2020-11-17 01:56:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It feels like there's an international coup going on being ran by people in their basement too afraid to go outside.
1328391762449207296 2020-11-17 01:37:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We’re not going away. Concede nothing.
1328380481260425218 2020-11-17 00:52:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The poll shows 57% support stricter gun laws.
1328380291392675840 2020-11-17 00:51:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> And we know how trash polls are.
1328377079621152769 2020-11-17 00:39:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I once got 54 votes (20%) in an election (a real one). I didn't even campaign.
1328372404654108682 2020-11-17 00:20:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Haven't heard anything today.
1328371293549441024 2020-11-17 00:16:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dems would have to bank on yet another AA turnout surge in the fraud states and to get back a huge chunk of the Hispanic vote. Those two things are incompatible at this point.
1328370869547266052 2020-11-17 00:14:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The narrative of this election from the exit polls and mainstream media would lead you to believe the 2024 election is going to be an inevitable 10 point GOP landslide. Like, seniors and White men turn against the GOP? Yeah, they'll be home in 2024. Not clear Ds get anyone back.
1328369912746823680 2020-11-17 00:10:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 Yes, but the ball needs to get rolling this week. Trump's team says to watch for this week. We will see what they have up their sleeve.
1328368573794967552 2020-11-17 00:05:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad They are acting in desperation right now. Even if we assume the results of the Presidential Election are legitimate, the national conservative/populist movement is on the verge of an absolute majority of voters and that can only be held up for so long. They have to break us.
1328367675500883970 2020-11-17 00:01:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Seriously, why won't they let people audit the absentee vote signatures?
1328366756503703558 2020-11-16 23:58:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @JayFiveK @HLBuncombe That's my suspicion as well: They're doing the hand recount just to distract us from the real issues. Difficult to trust these people at this point.
1328365837053546498 2020-11-16 23:54:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad Now it's just to break our spirit and further centralize power and wealth in the hands of the big tech monopolies.
1328364999979507714 2020-11-16 23:51:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @HLBuncombe Alabama doesn't have Dominion, notably. However, they're doing a hand recount now. Wouldn't it show up? This whole audit feels more like a coverup than a genuine audit, though. Difficult to see rural GOP counties in on something, though.
1328363896076455938 2020-11-16 23:46:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RoyalistW I think California is primed for a GOP bounceback. It kind of happened this cycle and likely will gather momentum in 2022.
1328363664160792582 2020-11-16 23:45:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cowmix *no voters' remorse
1328363435223117829 2020-11-16 23:44:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cowmix It is important for the national psyche that the vast majority of the vote is cast on the same day after the full campaign is held. There should be absolutely voters' remorse until after Election Day.
1328363073372041217 2020-11-16 23:43:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RoyalistW California elections, I don't even know. Illegals vote in some places and throws things off, but I'm not sure how much at this point.
1328362865477160960 2020-11-16 23:42:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RoyalistW Washington State for sure should not be as blue as it is and is only that blue because King County harvests mail ins like mad.   Other states probably are corrupt too, but most of that is good, old fashioned box stuffing.
1328361984811732992 2020-11-16 23:39:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> January 2021, with new sessions of state legislatures: Demand they end mail in voting except for very good cause. Limit in person early voting to the same causes as well.
1328359998959783936 2020-11-16 23:31:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> How did Republicans lose even more seats in the California State Senate? They did gain one in the State Assembly, though.
1328359299333173248 2020-11-16 23:28:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> My team is supposed to have a daily stand up and it has been removed from the calendar like 12 of the past 15 days. Yes, it's very daily, guys.
1328358963872731140 2020-11-16 23:27:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bronzeagemantis Trump is a pragmatist with nationalistic and conservative sympathies. This is what he ran as in 2016 and this is how he governed. People who don't think so were just reading what they wanted into his campaign the way one projects their dreams on some girl they're crushing on.
1328357708395925504 2020-11-16 23:22:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Democrats will go through nursing homes and just flat out fill out a ballot for some elderly woman who barely has a coherent thought. But, we know in her heart of hears that she's really a liberal Democrat.
1328357272830042113 2020-11-16 23:20:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp To be fair, this is the historic alignment in terms of actual policy (minus the "muh racism" rhetoric).
1328357040130056197 2020-11-16 23:19:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> One reason mail ins need to be ILLEGAL, like they are in many countries, is because they are used as a tool to harass the elderly and it's evil. You would never be able to know these aren't legitimate ballots either.
1328356266440355847 2020-11-16 23:16:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I regret to inform the neocons, but the party of forever wars and "muh free trade" is forever over.
1328345454422192130 2020-11-16 22:33:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky @realkingprep @GavinWax New York would be red without New York City. California, you're right about.

1328197593525063680 2020-11-16 12:45:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It’s only a means by which Democratic machine counties intimidate voters.
1328197345406803968 2020-11-16 12:44:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Ban mail in voting.
1328192756792111104 2020-11-16 12:26:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Barack Obama: People having different opinions about how to interpret facts means democracy doesn’t work.   Well, he’s right, but in a wrong sort of way.
1328190712404447233 2020-11-16 12:18:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Why is every enemy of ours a pedo? Super creepy at this point.
1328188772631142407 2020-11-16 12:10:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Could easily get back Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin just auditing mail in votes. Possibly Nevada. Penn is like halfway there or more.
1328175501396111360 2020-11-16 11:18:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LDF120 @WilkesBoothProj @realikamusume Trump ran as a conservative in 2016. The tax cuts you people complain about were on his website and he even gave a policy speech about them.
1328174219939733504 2020-11-16 11:13:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LDF120 @WilkesBoothProj @realikamusume Getting an extra 3% of the national vote seems like a pretty good deal. And Trump ran as a conservative and the people like you saying he didn’t just weren’t paying attention, sorry.
1328173949948227591 2020-11-16 11:12:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LDF120 @WilkesBoothProj @realikamusume Trump turned out a lot more people. More than I even thought possible in some of these states. There’s only so much Trump can do even if he was a perfect President. It’s called the law of diminishing returns.
1328172945383043072 2020-11-16 11:08:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LDF120 @WilkesBoothProj @realikamusume It indicates Trump didn’t lose support. This is evident in raw vote totals and share. We really need a full audit of these results to even know where this mass of new Biden votes came from. Until then, any analysis you’re conducting is extremely tainted.
1328172580742844418 2020-11-16 11:06:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LDF120 @WilkesBoothProj @realikamusume Less? Dude we’re talking 8.1% vs. 8.13%. And Trump clearly did win over more Indies and Dems in Ohio: Mahoning County doesn’t flip on conservative Republicans.
1328171164162809858 2020-11-16 11:00:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LDF120 @WilkesBoothProj @realikamusume You know Trump got a higher percentage of the vote in all three rust belt states, right?
1328170237972328450 2020-11-16 10:57:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 Dare question CNN reporting and you're an enemy of democracy, though.
1328170072439812096 2020-11-16 10:56:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Woke_TGC Some people seem to believe in the Divine Right of the American Union.

1328168335712935936 2020-11-16 10:49:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LDF120 @WilkesBoothProj @realikamusume This election was either a realigning election beyond Trump's control or the results in the 3 lost rust belt states are suspect. Why were WWC people in OH shifting towards him more than in PA? This isn't answerable from a policy standpoint. It just isn't.
1328167979901734913 2020-11-16 10:48:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LDF120 @WilkesBoothProj @realikamusume You're really just ignorant of political trends. Looking at Ohio, Florida, Indiana, etc. as a control group, it's pretty clear that whatever losses he had among college Whites were made up for increased non college support or turnout.  1/2
1328167313665892354 2020-11-16 10:45:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nc_groyp I genuinely enjoy discussing the issues, but there are no issues to discuss. This wasn't always the case.
1328166955061219329 2020-11-16 10:44:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I really don't like being forced to fall back into a right wing echo here, but it's really the only way to stay sane anymore. You can't take people seriously who just assume the other side always lacks any point at all about anything.
1328166544204066817 2020-11-16 10:42:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Politics has gotten way more boring for people like me since the left has rejected any form of dialogue with their opponents. They constantly just make apocalyptic pronouncements and say we have "no evidence" of anything. It's like, no: You're just being dense.
1328165964689645570 2020-11-16 10:40:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @peggyhill755 @17cShyteposter @RealAPolitics @toad_spotted It just wasn't. The Pennsylvania election in general was conducted violating multiple state statutes. Just a fact. Just because you got a court and an executive officer to cover for your latent criminality doesn't change the fact it was criminal.  Also, lmao at citing DHS.
1328163881882161152 2020-11-16 10:32:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @peggyhill755 @17cShyteposter @RealAPolitics @toad_spotted You guys want to run an election in an absolutely lawless manner and then get mad when someone notices it doesn't make any sense. I don't care how it turns out at this point: We're not going away and the only idiot is you if you think so.
1328163403626590208 2020-11-16 10:30:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnbourbon98 What do you expect from some non-lawyer telling real lawyers how to do their job?
1328162169008119808 2020-11-16 10:25:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm wrong because I used slander in a colloquial sense and didn't use it in a legally precise manner. Lefties love their technicalities. "Haha, I won because you use word wrong."
1328161854036828161 2020-11-16 10:23:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @peggyhill755 @17cShyteposter @RealAPolitics @toad_spotted The courts of these places you are referencing are corrupt. We will see how the legal process plays out from here. In the meantime, continue enjoying your party of corruption and darkness.

1328158418130046976 2020-11-16 10:10:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Did you know some corrupt courts in Philly and Detroit ruled against Trump? Get owned MAGAts, there's clearly nothing to your case if the esteemed judges of Wayne County, Michigan do not even hear your case.

Some county level data in NYC, Cook, and Broward Counties (which has a large Black population more like Northern than Southern Blacks) indicates a shift towards the GOP.
1328121760928182280 2020-11-16 07:44:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WilkesBoothProj @realikamusume That’s solely Georgia. Southern Blacks have always been more loyal than Northern Blacks for Democrats. This is for historical reasons (Northern Blacks were once controlled by GOP machines themselves). And, yes, decreased turnout among the group is some vindication for them.

1328119178142896128 2020-11-16 07:34:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Peoples_Pundit The sheer number of attempted dead votes is suspected. A few dozen, maybe even a couple hundred can be chalked up to clerical error. Ten thousand? Clerical error? How bad is this clerk?
1328118251080052746 2020-11-16 07:30:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Good thread on Trump supposedly losing the WWC, which isn’t backed up by actual returns outside the fraud states.
1328115109785427969 2020-11-16 07:18:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee Thankfully for the Presidential Election, we have contingencies for an invalid election: State legislatures and House contingent election. If other races are invalidated, a new election can be held and it has happened before.
1328114482518888450 2020-11-16 07:15:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WilkesBoothProj @RupertVonRipp @JayFiveK @realikamusume The only reason it looks that way is the thousands of fake votes urban Black Democrat machines printed for them. Basically what happened in the real world is a small shift and a turnout decline among AAs. Not voting for your opponent is a win, unless someone else votes for them.
1328111628131463169 2020-11-16 07:04:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Many states conducted this election in a lawless manner. That needs to be addressed. Do we just need to accept it as a fair accompli? Does it invalidate the results? What does that mean?
1328111415350206465 2020-11-16 07:03:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There are definitely legal issues with the way this election was conducted that the courts need to address. Ignoring them just would be a shirking of their duty. They may not rule the way we want, but the opinion they issue on the circumstances will be important.
1328109828623970304 2020-11-16 06:57:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 When have these people ever been right? Trump definitely needs to get some legal momentum going this week, but that is entirely possible. Only way it won’t happen is if courts just ignore evidence.
1328109315786485762 2020-11-16 06:55:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ProfoundProfit Over aggressive...ok.
1328108186054832128 2020-11-16 06:50:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LueYee Smells and bells.
1328108062058680322 2020-11-16 06:50:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 Most of it is media spin at this point. Most of the cases that have been dismissed are basically in places like Detroit where the courts are in on the whole gag.
1328104497600753665 2020-11-16 06:36:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Georgia was robbed. It’s impossible to analyze results of a robbed election.
1328103658488274947 2020-11-16 06:32:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Definitely don’t want to leave any potential argument on the table.
1328103129024503808 2020-11-16 06:30:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you feel like the Trump team’s messaging is all over the place, they’re likely pursuing multiple legal angles because there are multiple viable legal paths to challenge the results.
1328099751598940165 2020-11-16 06:17:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Also the people walking around with masks while outdoors.

1328087683042861059 2020-11-16 05:29:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roland_Gunn2 In most of the country, there does seem to have been a large anti-Trump vote that dumped early. In states like Florida and Ohio, the closer to Election Day someone cast their ballot, the more pro-Trump they were. Cross the line into PA and all these patterns go out the window.
1328087067440656389 2020-11-16 05:26:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lauraka09619649 It’s really difficult to analyze the meaning of this election from any other angle. They’re claiming it’s a realignment election on the “no fraud, Trumpsters” side, but who realigned to what and why? Like it doesn’t make sense.
1328086662979661826 2020-11-16 05:25:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Miche1T @JayFiveK Yes. And a good attorney with a respected record in court.
1328086118898733056 2020-11-16 05:23:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Another thing that’s weird about the Pennsylvania mail in debacle is that the late mail ins leaned more towards Biden than the early ones when all indications are that the race tightened in the final days.
1328085735262609409 2020-11-16 05:21:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK She has a lot more credibility in my mind than some of the other goombas in Camp Trump. I hope she delivers and isn’t just yanking my chain.

1328079763152510976 2020-11-16 04:57:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @17cShyteposter @RealAPolitics @toad_spotted The PA one is close to believable (if it weren’t for about 150K of the mail ins materializing the day after the election). The one that has a big red flag is Michigan. There’s no real reason it should be that different from Ohio or Illinois.
1328078300787462144 2020-11-16 04:51:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal Them continuing to use the word “decisive” over a very narrow win is ridiculous.
1328077592264642561 2020-11-16 04:49:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 If we get Biden/Harris, we will have an opening between 2022 and 2024 to crush them. 2024 could be a huge GOP landslide.
1328077041154072579 2020-11-16 04:46:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump really did try to reach out to more center right Republicans, like Paul Ryan, and bring them on board. This was a reasonable and admirable goal, if naive. I don’t know if he has learned his lesson yet.
1328075637358288897 2020-11-16 04:41:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 People need leaders.   I do think it’s possible Trump presents enough evidence of fraud, but the courts turn a deaf ear to it, and he escapes with both a loyal following intact and without the Presidency.
1328074652959301639 2020-11-16 04:37:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @CrankyFed This is why I voted for the man.
1328074414928359426 2020-11-16 04:36:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 I’m not stressed about it. I do worry if they don’t have the goods that our people will be demoralized in the future. We don’t have a replacement for Trump out there really.
1328074046047662081 2020-11-16 04:35:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Who fired him?
1328073699371720704 2020-11-16 04:33:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biden basically intends to allow his buddies to rape the small businesses of the country while demoralizing families and you wonder why I think Trump and Republicans should resist by every method possible.
1328073267236790272 2020-11-16 04:31:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Regardless of what happens, I’m going to get more involved in local Republican politics in some place where we actually have a chance of winning.

1328071830825996293 2020-11-16 04:26:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon Disagree: This week is make or break.
1328071533248516101 2020-11-16 04:25:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles True. Half these accounts seem to glow in the dark at this point.
1328071284836732928 2020-11-16 04:24:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dissident Right folks would really learn a lot by taking the proverb “you catch more flies with honey than vinegar” seriously. Kicking MAGA folks when the media is kicking them too will just alienate them.
1328070741783416834 2020-11-16 04:21:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Really feel like this lady is yanking my chain, but we will see.
1328067309261426693 2020-11-16 04:08:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Some GOP pol could have nipped this whole thing in the bud by just going like “Trump speaks for many of our supporters who feel disenfranchised. I appreciate him representing these people and I would like to earn their support.” None of them would do that.
1328066561442197513 2020-11-16 04:05:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The method people have used to attack Trump from day one of his campaign is basically the equivalent of trying to escape from one of those self tightening knots. You’re just proving his point.
1328065382150713347 2020-11-16 04:00:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou In Nevada, they basically set the machine settings so low, they’d accept any signature. They set it to 40%, which the manufacturer manual says you might as well not even be checking signatures at that point.
1328063686112636929 2020-11-16 03:53:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> ACB for the majority: “There’s no way Basement Biden got 78 million legal votes. Therefore, all disputed electors go to Trump.”

1328057334577442816 2020-11-16 03:28:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Humans have rarely experienced anything like this kind of dehumanizing treatment from government. Constantly treated like a suspect, like a potential malefactor for merely engaging in normal activities like...visiting friends and family.
1328056204812316674 2020-11-16 03:24:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp People who don’t see this are just dumb. Hate to go all lolbert, but the extreme safety nanny state that has grown leaps and bounds over the past two decades is basically an enemy to anyone with sufficient T levels to challenge them.
1328055060308369409 2020-11-16 03:19:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> People still buying Covid apocalypse narratives have proven how extremely gullible they are.

He basically had two ways to win. Biden can only win by the courts ignoring the fraud. I think the evidence at this point is overwhelming with witness testimony.
1328044041037111299 2020-11-16 02:35:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @USDwraith @MosleyGang @SelimSeesYou If the fraud claims are proven, then the elections will likely be considered too tainted at this point. The Democratic machines have intentionally mixed the fraud ballots with the real ballots to make a true count impossible.
1328043445911515136 2020-11-16 02:33:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MosleyGang @USDwraith @SelimSeesYou *three things

1328042306595909635 2020-11-16 02:28:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago Imagine being a Kamala supporter.

1328040311520694275 2020-11-16 02:20:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MosleyGang @USDwraith @SelimSeesYou This is my opinion. This week is make or break due to certifications as well. States will start certifying results by the end of this week.
1328039494541586432 2020-11-16 02:17:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou She’s a successful former federal prosecutor and defense attorney. She has been representing Flynn since last year.

1328019520741634048 2020-11-16 00:58:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> LMAO.
1328017764708212740 2020-11-16 00:51:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> National mail ins thrown out. Trump wins every state.
1328013271589335048 2020-11-16 00:33:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy For Pennsylvania: I’d expect it to be the highest on this list because PA Republicans were much more against mail ins than other states. However, over 3:1? That seems absolutely ridiculous.
1328008642113761281 2020-11-16 00:15:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I don’t know. People keep saying they did. Maybe they’re just that brazen.
1328007439552274435 2020-11-16 00:10:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp It should be. It’s a federal felony to destroy the signature envelopes less than two years after the election.

1327864840308846592 2020-11-15 14:43:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf I’m not saying not to pursue the angle. However, it can’t be that easy, can it?
1327864574029295622 2020-11-15 14:42:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @coronayomama @ScottMGreer I definitely would have preferred he made a speech.
1327863557682237445 2020-11-15 14:38:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Dominion stuff just seems too easy to me. Like it’s a trap of some kind.

1327860357445120000 2020-11-15 14:25:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There must be a manner of redressing grievances among the population. Back in the day, this used to be being able to make your case personally before the King. Nowadays it's supposed to be through voting. Nullifying that through whatever scheme destroys regime credibility.
1327859470886637568 2020-11-15 14:22:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Oh, no, the horror. It must be terrifying.
1327856973199642627 2020-11-15 14:12:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PerfInjust @LueYee Really, Trump supporters shouldn't have been out marching to begin with because we're not respecting the lawful authorities enough when we do so.
1327855939400110080 2020-11-15 14:08:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 It's beyond anyone's control at this point. Government is losing legitimacy really fast.
1327855637393534976 2020-11-15 14:07:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @17cShyteposter Trump will either be the 2024 nominee or pick whoever it will be. His people are loyal and he commands enough of them to have the whole race wrapped up on Super Tuesday.
1327855458053464065 2020-11-15 14:06:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @17cShyteposter It really depends how much bad luck they have and what path they tread. If they go hard social left, they'll face less internal strife, but will alienate the center. If they moderate, then they will face a strong internal primary challenger while the GOP stands united.
1327853699151130624 2020-11-15 13:59:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LueYee At the height, there were definitely hundreds of thousands in the city.
1327853520708624385 2020-11-15 13:58:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @17cShyteposter I don't see it lasting beyond Biden/Harris, if that's any comfort if he does succeed. The civil war that will occur in the Democratic Party will be greater than anything the GOP has ever experienced. The only question will be what people do with the power vacuum.
1327851235744026624 2020-11-15 13:49:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FlycatcherSilky I left as I knew it would turn into a shit show. Kind of regret it, though. Sounds like a lot of fun is being had still.
1327851113543049216 2020-11-15 13:49:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Sticking to the National Mall and you'll mostly have the Capitol Police around and they'll be sure to stop any nonsense.
1327850826539393026 2020-11-15 13:48:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Would be an extremely bad look for the country for there to be a brawl on the steps of the Capitol Building itself, after all.
1327850718343081984 2020-11-15 13:47:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Just to clarify what's going on in DC: There's two sets of police. DC Police and Capitol Police. DC Police are your typical corrupt urban police department. Capitol Police are under the control of the Feds and are generally very good with maintaining peace at rallies.
1327847235237916677 2020-11-15 13:33:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @17cShyteposter Constitutional Government is failing. It just is. The people who cling onto it are either benefitting from the bad policies or hopelessly naive about what comes next. They'd have all been better off to just take the L with Trump.
1327845231333617664 2020-11-15 13:25:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jefferyclark The raw number of rejected ballots in Pennsylvania makes the whole thing suspect. There were more in 2016 and 2018 in terms of raw numbers and that was with significantly less mail in voting.
1327841476664057858 2020-11-15 13:10:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton @benjamin_blitz @jefferyclark @RealAPolitics He claims he would accept an audit, but he should ask himself the question why no one is doing that of their own free will.
1327841207578480641 2020-11-15 13:09:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton @benjamin_blitz @jefferyclark @RealAPolitics Probably the same old "you're unamerican for wanting to disenfranchise people!" as if conducting elections in an unlawful manner isn't the very definition of disenfranchisement. Trump got record turnout: Almost the best possible and we're just supposed to accept this lawlessness.
1327840574288912385 2020-11-15 13:07:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton @benjamin_blitz @jefferyclark @RealAPolitics LOL, dude blocked me.
1327840017822134272 2020-11-15 13:05:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @benjamin_blitz "No evidence."   We have witness testimony from multiple people. That is evidence. Stop lying.
1327839781200551936 2020-11-15 13:04:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton @benjamin_blitz @jefferyclark @RealAPolitics It's a genuine constitutional crisis and the narrow margins in a number of states make it difficult to just accept it as a fait accompli. If Biden had won by 5 points across the swing states like the polls predicted, fait accompli would be an easier pill to swallow.
1327839458117496833 2020-11-15 13:02:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton @benjamin_blitz @jefferyclark @RealAPolitics Yeah, the manner in which these elections were conducted in a broad number of states were flat illegal by state statute. Of course, some of that should have been rectified before the election, but a lot of this stuff was sprung in the final two months of the campaign.
1327839090918760448 2020-11-15 13:01:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @benjamin_blitz LOL, you won't like what you find after an audit.
1327838396979552256 2020-11-15 12:58:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They consider the most basic precautions of election security "technicalities." They care not one wit for the "will of the people" expressed through a free and fair election. They don't care that any procedures are in place. They'd prefer there are none.
1327836625330728961 2020-11-15 12:51:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @benjamin_blitz @jefferyclark @RealAPolitics You are the people disenfranchising voters by allowing illegal votes. Let's get that straight.
1327836390525181952 2020-11-15 12:50:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @benjamin_blitz There are extremely few cases they can't take. If a case can be tried in your local courthouse, it likely can be appealed all the way to SCOTUS. Some states it's even theoretically possible to appeal a traffic ticket all the way. Not that they will take the case.
1327835048616275969 2020-11-15 12:45:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jefferyclark @benjamin_blitz @RealAPolitics It disenfranchises the Citizens of Pennsylvania as well.
1327834718272937986 2020-11-15 12:44:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 His impeachment was also a political scam, just like Trump's was. He wasn't convicted because enough Senators realized it was terrible precedent to set.
1327834391423426563 2020-11-15 12:42:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @benjamin_blitz @jefferyclark @RealAPolitics They can't choose to conduct their elections in an unconstitutional manner or in a manner that is in conflict with their own laws.
1327832735432503297 2020-11-15 12:36:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Filmerian1 Very true. However, God has made our choices a part of His plan. Right now, the indications are that the choice has already been fundamentally made. We've crossed the proverbial Rubicon and we're just waiting for the outcome of the ensuing civil war.
1327830025224265729 2020-11-15 12:25:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 Eisenhower wanted to fight the fraud, but Nixon chose it would be better if he staged a comeback. We will see Trump's ultimate choice.
1327829619156922369 2020-11-15 12:23:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Not that they ever really are completely in our hands, but there are definitely times when it feels like our choices have more weight. Right now, events seem to be taking a life of their own. It doesn't really matter what most of us think, things will happen the way they will.
1327829179941974023 2020-11-15 12:22:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Events might simply be out of the hands of us mere mortals at this point, I think.
1327828831609221122 2020-11-15 12:20:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Stand back and stand by.
1327828605662064642 2020-11-15 12:19:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @HeritageNLegacy @Ori_Ar I absolutely agree with you. Hopefully we get to a breaking point where we say enough is enough and do something that outside the current pale before we're at the point this country is a real powder keg. If it isn't already. Might be beyond us mere mortals at this point.
1327827375648878592 2020-11-15 12:14:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou  https://t.co/Q5Jal6h2Nr
1327826675804024836 2020-11-15 12:12:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @HeritageNLegacy @Ori_Ar Either way, Harris (let's be real, Joe's going to be luck to be alive in 2024) will face a primary challenger in 2024 and the GOP will likely have a nominee that is either Trump himself or his handpicked successor by Super Tuesday.
1327826356261031944 2020-11-15 12:10:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @HeritageNLegacy @Ori_Ar The Democrats are stuck between a rock and a hard place: They either go full lefty psychopath with BLM and alienate Whites and Hispanics (and a sufficient minority of Blacks), or they go full moderate and don't get anyone out to vote in 2024 because Biden/Harris will be terrible.
1327825804143767555 2020-11-15 12:08:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @HeritageNLegacy @Ori_Ar I honestly think 2024 could be that breaking point if Trump doesn't pull off a legal miracle here (which I think the best outcome). There are a lot of seats that could be on the map in the Senate if it breaks big like a 1980 style landslide.
1327824875608748038 2020-11-15 12:04:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @HeritageNLegacy @Ori_Ar Do you ever see the Democrats giving up their voting base?
1327823698599010304 2020-11-15 12:00:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @HeritageNLegacy @Ori_Ar They could, but then that convention has to come up with amendments that will get ratified by three quarters of the states. I'm not sure if the right could get anything through a Convention it couldn't get through Congress. A Convention could propose more radical reforms, though.
1327822590195478528 2020-11-15 11:55:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @HeritageNLegacy @Ori_Ar I don't see that resolving any stalemates that would occur in Congress, really. The only way I see that ending while accomplishing a lot is by essentially agreeing to dissolve the Union, but that seems extremely unlikely.
1327819199905935360 2020-11-15 11:42:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The loyalty of Trump's base meeting the fanaticism of his opponents. This just *is* the stuff "unrest," to put it mildly, is made of.
1327818786670596096 2020-11-15 11:40:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Same, but I just got a feeling this could get really ugly really fast.
1327818432629313541 2020-11-15 11:39:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @Ori_Ar Maybe, but I just see continued stalemate indefinitely.
1327818066974158849 2020-11-15 11:37:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Uh....uh....Is this actually going to happen?
1327817412805267457 2020-11-15 11:35:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ori_Ar Democrats are raw obstructionists when it comes to any meaningful right-wing reform. They will pull out all the stops.
1327816887477153794 2020-11-15 11:33:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fran7zero7 290 is two-thirds, which is constitutional majority (you can pass a constitutional amendment without consent from the opposing party).
1327816686330908674 2020-11-15 11:32:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The way I see it the only way out of this long term and mostly peacefully is to ram through Constitutional Amendments. 67 Senators is actually a doable number if 2024 is a GOP landslide. 290 GOP House Seats is much harder.
1327816217730682886 2020-11-15 11:30:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Is there anyway we can gerrymander the House to get 290 GOP seats?
1327812783937826816 2020-11-15 11:16:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat I thought Max Trump votes in California was ~6 million, he's at 5.73. Biden is near the max too, which I put at 11-12. I didn't think that could be simultaneous, though.
1327812503041093632 2020-11-15 11:15:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat They use Dominion and if they did steal everywhere, there are some spots in California Trump could have made some large gain. He definitely didn't win it, but enough to put him well ahead in the popular vote.   He's actually near my "Max Trump votes" in California.
1327811846179598342 2020-11-15 11:13:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReformedMallard I overheard some moderate Democrats who couldn't wait for an "old White man who won't do anything" to come back into office today. LMAO.
1327811415160336386 2020-11-15 11:11:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ClassicalTheis Shit, we're going to lose now, aren't we?
1327808036086444034 2020-11-15 10:57:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy It's ballot stuffing on the Rez.
1327806698036350977 2020-11-15 10:52:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy I'd believe there are enough local factors to make one or two of these states turn out differently, but it's just extremely hard to get anything like this lineup with only one or two exceptions.
1327806290849095680 2020-11-15 10:51:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics My understanding is the law allowing extensions wasn't actually a law, but a legal fiction created by the court. Thus, the statute would be restored over against the legal fiction. There are other problems with the mail in ballot system in Penn this year, though.
1327805194730659842 2020-11-15 10:46:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy LOL, shows how trash exit polls are.
1327803749776191490 2020-11-15 10:40:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> By force if necessary.
1327803528979615744 2020-11-15 10:40:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles It's One Struggle right now. It's traditional government or it's lawless anarcho-tyranny ran by horrendous media companies. Yes, I'll take American style democracy over the latter.
1327803284049047552 2020-11-15 10:39:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacksonPackson1 Chanting 1776 just wasn't from the heart for me.
1327800611639873536 2020-11-15 10:28:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles I'm descended from Loyalists.
1327800509458231296 2020-11-15 10:28:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacksonPackson1 I'm descended from Tories and generally agree with the philosophy.
1327793518362972160 2020-11-15 10:00:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Even if we posit the election results are legitimate, this makes it extremely hard to glean any long term lessons from a Trump "defeat." Because it's just uncharted territory and would take many election cycles to study the impact of this bizarre, unprecedented realignment.
1327793085888204800 2020-11-15 09:58:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Note, that even on this map, Ohio and Iowa are much closer than they are in the real world. The Demos in these states just match the rest of the rust belt with some variations. It is extremely bizarre demographically.
1327791909037875202 2020-11-15 09:53:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These uniform national swings are never precise, but these crazy divergences between states and even areas within states are just bizarre.
1327791446431248384 2020-11-15 09:52:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm playing around with the Cook Swingometer and it's basically impossible to get these election results. You have to posit like 75% Black and 85% College White turnout to even get close.  https://t.co/yNo0qnYMaS
1327789656616955905 2020-11-15 09:44:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd @HeritageNLegacy @AnglicanMan19 Honestly, I probably should have gotten up a bit earlier and met with the Groypers in front of the hotel. Ended up getting to the rally only like 15 minutes early. Was in a perfect spot to hear the speakers at SCOTUS, though and the dude next to me was hilarious.
1327788304020942848 2020-11-15 09:39:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Dadetalian @JayFiveK If Trump announces a rally in DC personally to announce his win, they could fill the National Mall.
1327787600178982912 2020-11-15 09:36:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd @HeritageNLegacy @AnglicanMan19 Was trying to find you guys, but didn't hear word where it would be. Was sad, but didn't want to be roaming DC alone at night when I knew Antifa would be around.
1327787322352541698 2020-11-15 09:35:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I think all we can do is pray our people get out safely and Trump addresses this.   "The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will."   That's really all we can do at this point.
1327786876233715712 2020-11-15 09:33:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @No2Sovereignty Biden is a traitor. The Steal is a crisis of State. We have just cause here.
1327786222824140800 2020-11-15 09:31:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @AnglicanMan19 @JacobCLloyd I think the worst thing they did during the day was light up some joints at their "counter demonstration." Wreaked in front of the rally stage because of that.
1327785529409228801 2020-11-15 09:28:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @realDonaldTrump This needs to end next week or the third movie of this trilogy ain't going to be pretty.
1327784668096245760 2020-11-15 09:25:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 I've made it home. I knew this would turn into a shit show, so when I couldn't figure out where @JacobCLloyd and the gang were, I headed home through the Federal area that is heavily policed.
1327784363120087041 2020-11-15 09:23:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We're just beyond the point ordinary constitutional government as we have come to know it can handle this crisis. It's just a fact. We need stronger action than our bureaucratic state is built to handle.
1327781646507122690 2020-11-15 09:13:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates I had no idea these people didn't even allow pentests. Quite clear they intend to allow hacking their systems if that's the case.
1327780511725531141 2020-11-15 09:08:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @parkercassidy4 Yes, and they are your typical incompetent urban police department. Capitol Police do a good job keeping the Capitol vicinity under control. Secret Service controls the area immediately around the White House and do a good job as well.
1327779919594741761 2020-11-15 09:06:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 DC Police are trash. Capitol Police (different group) told the organizers to send us down Independence. A lot of people went down Constitution (where BLM plaza is) anyway and then hung around until after dark.   Capitol Police are the ones the Feds directly control.
1327778411729866754 2020-11-15 09:00:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 At the risk of playing the devil's advocate: We were specifically told not to go the direction those people went. The energy is still high out there. I don't think anyone is being intimidated by this.
1327776810067767297 2020-11-15 08:53:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Whoever maligned Lauren Boebert as some deranged conspiracy theorist should recant their slander.
1327776147535433734 2020-11-15 08:51:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Dadetalian GOP women are always more attractive, even when they're terrible.
1327775697868353537 2020-11-15 08:49:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Nikki Haley is the Right's Kamala Harris. She'll never win a primary. Some dummie might pick her for Veep, though.
1327775390681751555 2020-11-15 08:48:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou There was actually a group of people at the Rally today with this walking around. Weren't even the Groypers.
1327775166668136451 2020-11-15 08:47:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @SouthernConsDem Bombing people without just cause just is terrible. I mean, what kind of worse abuse of power can you imagine? People actually die over that.
1327774965031198720 2020-11-15 08:46:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Ave Caesar Trump.
1327773466293047302 2020-11-15 08:40:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @diosreyypatria @ClassicalTheis I should note I think 2 is from fraud more than genuine shift as well. Trump is getting a lot more votes in these suburbs too, but turnout is bonkers high.
1327772900330450945 2020-11-15 08:38:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @diosreyypatria @ClassicalTheis The numbers in terms of vote totals simply don't show it. Trump got more WWC men and women out for him in every rust belt state. Biden's edge is coming from two things:  1. Obviously stuffed boxes in 4 urban areas. 2. A slight shift against Trump in some relevant suburbs.
1327771104103034881 2020-11-15 08:31:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy It's like: And this is bad, how, exactly?
1327770571187347456 2020-11-15 08:29:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical I voted Romney in 2012 after telling myself I wouldn't. Romney's main problem is that he was so polished he was boring, he ran an incredibly generic GOP campaign, and the author of Romneycare had no credibly as the opponent of Obamacare. Still, that was a winnable race.
1327769158361165824 2020-11-15 08:23:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed This is like Reno being further west than Los Angeles.
1327768904685465601 2020-11-15 08:22:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> MAGA ain't ever going away!
1327767727709229056 2020-11-15 08:17:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @radiationorgan @MosleyGang @SelimSeesYou Political violence is multiplying less because of GOP fecklessness (though I wish they'd crush these people and just proclaim Trump Caesar) and more because our system isn't designed for this moment. It simply doesn't have the resources to both stay itself and crush Antifa.
1327767345629171714 2020-11-15 08:16:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @radiationorgan @MosleyGang @SelimSeesYou The reason this even is happening is because Trump, regardless of what you think of the man himself, represents a force these people can't control. Telling people you support Trump openly is telling them they have no power over you and you don't really care about their opinion.
1327764857970712580 2020-11-15 08:06:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Just to give a bit of perspective: On the top left (apx. where I was), there's a line of Trump supporters you don't see wrapping around both buildings for at least two blocks (couldn't see farther). And this was before the rally officially commenced.
1327761184171454464 2020-11-15 07:51:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This stuff just sums how this is a battle of darkness versus light: Trump votes get counted in the day, Biden votes at 4 AM in some dark room with no observers. Trump rally is peaceful and happy (despite seemingly long odds) in the day. Antifa rally is violent and angry at night.
1327760836211978240 2020-11-15 07:50:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @revjackashcraft It wasn't supposed to start until noon. Definitely were hundreds of thousands out by the time the March really started rolling.
1327760632574251009 2020-11-15 07:49:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I apparently left just in time (and from the opposite direction).  Knew this was likely to turn into a shitshow the moment the sun went down. Martial law now.
1327759228719816713 2020-11-15 07:44:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidMasterson6 Lmao. You’re as dumb as you look.
1327759106367741954 2020-11-15 07:43:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We got to the rally. The rally was high energy, huge, and fun. Hopefully it rallied any flagging spirits there might have been in the Trump Camp.
1327728392658178049 2020-11-15 05:41:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Lol...I haven’t seen anything like this in town in terms of a rally ever.
1327722082751410176 2020-11-15 05:16:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Those are best exit polls ever seen for a Republican...and he loses? Like, what? Yeah, exit polls are utter trash, but usually trash that overestimates Democrats. When that CNN exit poll dropped that said 48% thought we had handled Covid well, I thought it was over TBH.
1327717926615605251 2020-11-15 04:59:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Hearing there’s an AF after rally. If anyone knows when/where LMK.
1327705403258531845 2020-11-15 04:10:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Lol, Dr. Taylor Marshall is speaking.
1327703773339324418 2020-11-15 04:03:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 @Peoples_Pundit Tens of thousands of illegal votes will delegitimize the entire vote even if it doesn’t throw out the entire election.
1327699820715384833 2020-11-15 03:47:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LueYee @JacobCLloyd I have not. It’s huge.
1327696828784140288 2020-11-15 03:36:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LueYee Yes
1327692368783486977 2020-11-15 03:18:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon Well, until the 2020 Presidential Election.
1327686824089759744 2020-11-15 02:56:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Loosey39671884 @zorkenfeetpics @CosmoDiGirolamo That isn’t incompatible with conspiracies existing.
1327673184662003716 2020-11-15 02:02:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal He has been saying “next week” all week.
1327672590803070976 2020-11-15 01:59:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal This week is make or break.
1327672239421091842 2020-11-15 01:58:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal It’s many hundreds of thousands. That’s a lot of people for hostile territory.
1327671519170977796 2020-11-15 01:55:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Nigel_Farage @BorisJohnson Run again Nigel!
1327668893951930369 2020-11-15 01:45:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> No, low T votes don’t count. Ergo, Biden got 0 votes.  https://t.co/t5FTx4cNZf
1327667552869363719 2020-11-15 01:39:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The counter demonstration is pretty pathetic.
1327652144623874055 2020-11-15 00:38:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 Took me a half an hour just to find a parking spot
1327650715343364096 2020-11-15 00:32:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> A spontaneous army assembles in DC for this man and you want me to think he lost?
1327640451176951808 2020-11-14 23:52:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @FreeNortherner Exactly. Pause in counting. Then the miraculous 4:30 AM 100% Biden dumps and you’re left wondering how someone doesn’t think it’s rigged.
1327633997220941825 2020-11-14 23:26:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Washington Post claims that there are “hundreds” of Trump supporters in DC. LMAO. Another claim so dishonest it only highlights the dishonesty of the one making the claim.
1327631569734012932 2020-11-14 23:16:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Indian_Bronson @JayFiveK Once again, net benefit. You can always point to things you wanted done better. Trump has limited immigration where he can. Went to great to enhance border security in spite of a lack of congressional will. He has done a lot of good.
1327631274148814849 2020-11-14 23:15:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Indian_Bronson @JayFiveK Trump was a bit naive when it came to Paul Ryan. He genuinely wanted to bring these people into the fold. That’s an admirable goal, if naive. As for Kushner, it’s his son-in-law and besides the Syria thing I’m a fan of Trump’s MidEast policy, which is what he mostly does.
1327630340568076288 2020-11-14 23:11:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Indian_Bronson @JayFiveK You guys demand the impossible. Could Trump do more? Yes, of course. No man is perfect, but that doesn’t mean he hasn’t been a net benefit to our cause. That’s what you should actually be looking for: Net benefit.
1327629892054372353 2020-11-14 23:10:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Indian_Bronson @JayFiveK You’re setting up a straw man. You’re the one suggesting we’re unflaggingly loyal no matter who or what the GOP is up to. We’re just people who don’t have a habit of making the perfect the enemy of the good. You want perfection, which is impossible in a two party democracy.
1327501742829957120 2020-11-14 14:40:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago Putting Illinois and New York on the map more than offsets the purpling of Georgia and North Carolina. Texas is a bit of a harder blow.
1327501052103569413 2020-11-14 14:38:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Indian_Bronson @JayFiveK This is how political coalitions work, yes.
1327500302845693952 2020-11-14 14:35:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp If Trump’s margins hold there, it could easily be a battleground in 2028.
1327497071285374976 2020-11-14 14:22:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba Gravy, cheese, fried potatoes. How can you hate on that?
1327494782923513856 2020-11-14 14:13:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy In my experience state level politicians are a lot more based than Federal ones as well.
1327494669421469696 2020-11-14 14:12:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy They will if their constituents demand it.
1327494182986985473 2020-11-14 14:10:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy Never say never.
1327494079559700481 2020-11-14 14:10:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Electoral College would be cooler if it met under the same circumstances as the College of Cardinals.
1327493429635506178 2020-11-14 14:07:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Reminder that the state legislatures of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin need to stop the steal and send Trump electors to the Electoral College.
1327490797776891904 2020-11-14 13:57:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @JayFiveK I’m two degrees removed from the President by an awkward happenstance. This means I know enough to know half these narratives are total BS.
1327489555654701056 2020-11-14 13:52:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @JayFiveK I don’t know. He might just have volunteered.
1327488661529763840 2020-11-14 13:48:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Indian Bronson is the quintessential “but at least we taught the GOP a lesson” guy.
1327487817421910016 2020-11-14 13:45:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It has been 1,978 days since Trump announced his campaign and we still haven’t gotten a serious debate about the policies he has espoused.
1327487350365106176 2020-11-14 13:43:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biden had to show up in Detroit and beg them to vote because they were incredibly energized to defeat the Bad Orange Man.
1327486837829603328 2020-11-14 13:41:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon They’d print ballots until Biden got 86 just to make it more credibly and avoid auto audits.
1327485632525070336 2020-11-14 13:36:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Trump needed to rip rural Pennsylvania Whites out of his ass cuz immigration.
1327484724667944960 2020-11-14 13:33:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan It’s basically victim blaming at this point.
1327483304493330438 2020-11-14 13:27:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan She actually would have made a decent populist if she hadn’t sold her soul to the Harvard gods.
1327482982014328832 2020-11-14 13:26:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan She used to be a Republican. 🤣
1327482417297428480 2020-11-14 13:24:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Warren is the biggest fraud in American politics and that’s saying something when the competition is record Biden turnout in Detroit to compete with.
1327481418734252033 2020-11-14 13:20:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Imagine voting for McMuffin in 2016.
1327476357664747522 2020-11-14 13:00:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It is November 14th. Donald Trump is still President. He has not conceded. Fight!
1327471843574472705 2020-11-14 12:42:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK It’s a dish best served cold!
1327457912533495808 2020-11-14 11:46:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Don’t even know what else to say. If you don’t find the way this all unfolded suspicious, you’re lack a sixth sense most of us have.
1327457616746991617 2020-11-14 11:45:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Why don’t people want an investigation? Like, really, you’re really gullible people. I want the best investigators in the world scouring Milwaukee, Pennsylvania, and Atlanta to audit these votes and if you don’t, you’re just wrong.
1327455997217153029 2020-11-14 11:39:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biden:  Fake news. Fake votes. Fake virus. Fake President.
1327455338208124936 2020-11-14 11:36:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Truth_Reaction Is this not always true, though? Pray!
1327454766994173953 2020-11-14 11:34:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Truth_Reaction I get you. Seems too good to be true right now.
1327453885989007361 2020-11-14 11:30:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Truth_Reaction Multiple people have went all in with this narrative and if it doesn’t pan out, just ugh.
1327448788865327106 2020-11-14 11:10:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Should I wear my body armor?
1327447315385344000 2020-11-14 11:04:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If this is you, you’re on the right track.  The good life is to own the libs in all their forms.
1327446871397322754 2020-11-14 11:02:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL These people are all so corrupt. And to think I was once excited over this cretin riding Ron Paul’s coattails into Congress.
1327446297750740992 2020-11-14 11:00:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL Dude would have lost to a wet paper bag.
1327446098517118976 2020-11-14 10:59:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Media announces Biden win.  Governors: Let’s oppress our people over the seasonal flu more.
1327445364014768129 2020-11-14 10:56:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This “libertarian” is ok with a Biden Presidency because election law procedures aren’t in the Constitution. Know what is? State legislatures choosing electors, bitch.
1327444253254021120 2020-11-14 10:52:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner Well, he stole like 7, let’s be real.
1327443793948200960 2020-11-14 10:50:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The 306-232 reversal in Trump is literally too perfect to be real.
1327443360324390914 2020-11-14 10:48:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lauraka09619649 @itsJeffTiderich Geez, apparently there’s a lot of parody Jeff Tiderich accounts lol
1327443167608758272 2020-11-14 10:48:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lauraka09619649 Her and @itsJeffTiderich. Weirdos.
1327441937411026944 2020-11-14 10:43:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AltBias @SelimSeesYou The fight has just begun lads.
1327441784822226944 2020-11-14 10:42:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These people would have a lot more weight if they hadn’t already socially ostracized 73 million plus people because they voted for the President.
1327441312879169541 2020-11-14 10:40:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @OVonReuenthal They faked like 30K votes in Fairfax being conservative.
1327441068955201536 2020-11-14 10:39:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ramzpaul Join us!
1327440776947785735 2020-11-14 10:38:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal I’m there.
1327440531211902976 2020-11-14 10:37:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal It has been a while since I’ve been to an actual Trump rally because Virginia wasn’t a battleground this year.
1327437467478265861 2020-11-14 10:25:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou He will need GOP unity.
1327436904179097600 2020-11-14 10:23:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon This type of crap would make a lot of sense if that Dominion stuff ended up being true. Just steal Trump votes: Brilliant!   It is basically only Dominion jurisdictions this kind of wild GOP-Trump performance is the case. That and Nebraska 2, but that’s a very local race.
1327431838323838976 2020-11-14 10:03:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @45ismyhomeboy @NickJFuentes Nando’s is amazing.
1327431479924822016 2020-11-14 10:01:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NickJFuentes Imagine having to live here.

1327427205064921088 2020-11-14 09:44:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Translation: Corrupt local court in some shithole in Pennsylvania rejects GOP challenge with poor reasoning.
1327426395861970945 2020-11-14 09:41:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> See y’all in France.  https://t.co/0USx7tYwkh

1327394807933755392 2020-11-14 07:35:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 The same guy sent in 9 ballots and all 9 were accepted.
1327394692884029440 2020-11-14 07:35:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Also, Victor Joecks committed a felony. We’ll pardon him if Trump wins.
1327385329238728712 2020-11-14 06:58:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics They always are.
1327382171192086531 2020-11-14 06:45:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @RealAPolitics Same. I’m almost thinking at this point the whole Georgia audit is a charade to discredit Dominion concerns. “Haha, they used Dominion, and the recount didn’t help!”
1327380127018332163 2020-11-14 06:37:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @RealAPolitics None of it makes any sense.
1327377650621542400 2020-11-14 06:27:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Mormons do not vote 90% Republican regularly. It’s a loyal constituency, but more on the order of 75%.

1327374105746739200 2020-11-14 06:13:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics It’s about demographics. When you look at counties with the same profile swinging in opposite directions, something is probably up.
1327373138695516161 2020-11-14 06:09:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperWars @Breaking911 Yeah, it wasn’t exactly confidence inspiring.
1327370987516661762 2020-11-14 06:01:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperLuke @JacobCLloyd Texas or California? lol
1327369172221833221 2020-11-14 05:54:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics The .03% rejection in Pennsylvania is absolutely ridiculous.
1327366076942921730 2020-11-14 05:41:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Anyone who wants to meetup associated with the rally, feel free to DM me.
1327363424704204803 2020-11-14 05:31:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner No one would be questioning things if it didn't seem these people were mysteriously ripping ballots out of their ass.
1327363120399069185 2020-11-14 05:30:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Take everything one day at a time, boys.

1327354488378765315 2020-11-14 04:55:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Virginia has joined with the latest round of trash lockdowns.
1327353538561929219 2020-11-14 04:51:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics But only in the fraud states.
1327353250287390726 2020-11-14 04:50:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @JayFiveK Nah, he's a prof at Hillsdale. These people are so dedicated to their cushy positions as the resident losers of the academy they really do believe that trash.
1327352530309959680 2020-11-14 04:47:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If this isn’t reason alone to keep in the fight, there never will be.
1327352281403170822 2020-11-14 04:46:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Then, we just overturned that will through an election that broke all laws and constitutional norms. And Trump is supposed to roll over and accept it? Why? What good of the nation is there in this?
1327352024019705861 2020-11-14 04:45:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> At one point does the constitutional sabotage become so great you just have to recognize the whole thing is a charade and you have to go back to original principles of government? We’ve just spent four years where unelected bureaucrats frustrated the will of the people.
1327350028814475266 2020-11-14 04:38:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LarrySchweikart @azfamily It's only like 200 ballots.
1327349805027307522 2020-11-14 04:37:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon Don't tell me that, bro. I'm gonna be there.
1327344704569176064 2020-11-14 04:16:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OakenOdyssey I'll give her this: She has a better shot at winning South Carolina than Tim Scott does. But Tim Scott has no chance. She'll probably do terrible in Iowa/New Hampshire, if lucky eke out a win in South Carolina, and then get creamed on Super Tuesday if there's only one other guy.
1327343481870835716 2020-11-14 04:12:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> No. Don't listen to these people saying this.
1327341556148424704 2020-11-14 04:04:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Nothing, I'm just having fun.

1327338092378861571 2020-11-14 03:50:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 @SelbJim OK, so waste of money.
1327327362980179973 2020-11-14 03:07:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob We need to stand behind Trump right now. It's do or die time.
1327323889601556480 2020-11-14 02:54:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Hearing reports from on the ground that the people of the Grand Canyon State think it was rigged too.
1327323198455754759 2020-11-14 02:51:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheGoldphinger @modestianrite It’s a last ditch effort after a stalemate IMO. Would rather fight it out. That’s just my bellicose talking, perhaps.
1327321910007435269 2020-11-14 02:46:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @modestianrite @TheGoldphinger Articles of Confederation, basically.
1327321678930702338 2020-11-14 02:45:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd There's a crown in the gutter.
1327321163492634624 2020-11-14 02:43:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @modestianrite Like I said: Even if it was good to start, all things decay and fail with time.
1327321003157041152 2020-11-14 02:42:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheGoldphinger @modestianrite The entire reason why the Founders structured our constitution the way they did was because they recognized a continental democracy was ridiculous in concept. We've gotten rid of nearly all checks to mass democracy and we've probably never ran a clean election ever anyway.
1327320091063676930 2020-11-14 02:39:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @modestianrite Most of these people just have really cushy positions and don't really care or are delusionally enamored with the Constitution. The Constitution might be great and all (I very much doubt it ever really was, of course), but this too shall pass.
1327319279159611398 2020-11-14 02:35:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Stoner_68 Exactly my point. Continuing to give legitimacy to this facade of legality is ridiculous.
1327318596142428160 2020-11-14 02:33:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is my honest opinion.
1327317709248487425 2020-11-14 02:29:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 @LuisBobby3 @realikamusume Exactly. They know what kind of power Trump has over his loyal base and that base has only gotten bigger. They insult and demean us for it, but this is a reciprocal relationship.
1327316951031554049 2020-11-14 02:26:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 @LuisBobby3 @realikamusume We just might not get a second shot at this. Ever. Whatever Trump chooses to do, we must stand behind him.
1327315857379385351 2020-11-14 02:22:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It has been my opinion since last week that as long as we could make it to the rally in DC tomorrow without Trump conceding, we would be able to stay in this fight and the show of support can help rally flagging spirits in the Trump Camp and on Capitol Hill.
1327314862259789824 2020-11-14 02:18:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @realikamusume He will if his supporters abandon him.
1327313778795536384 2020-11-14 02:13:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @realikamusume Well, let’s hope. I’d like it to be true, but this whole audit is off to an inauspicious start.
1327313291367026688 2020-11-14 02:12:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Here’s the thing: They *could* have stolen Georgia the old fashioned way and the entire purpose of the hand recount is to discredit claims of electronic interference, which might have affected the rust belt states. I’m still skeptical Dominion switched ballots en made, though.
1327310246637924354 2020-11-14 01:59:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> To use NRx terms: The fraudulent Cathedral has conspired to prevent a True Election of a counter-Cathedral force.
1327309377955622919 2020-11-14 01:56:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @VGKVegas @RealAPolitics Fake audit.
1327309217817096195 2020-11-14 01:55:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is a man who aids and abets liars to get your sons to die in foreign wars.
1327303072310181895 2020-11-14 01:31:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All he needs are his voters and the will to persevere.
1327302453876957186 2020-11-14 01:28:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL They know how dangerous this can get.
1327301901344514052 2020-11-14 01:26:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Not all lawsuits are the same.
1327301573916172288 2020-11-14 01:25:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @HeritageNLegacy The Dominion stuff just seems too good to be true to me. Like, they couldn't have been that hamfisted about it, could they?
1327301045056380937 2020-11-14 01:23:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The only real reason Dayton, Ohio narrowly flipped is the corrupt military contractors there.
1327299632129564674 2020-11-14 01:17:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I would like to remind everyone my position cannot be clearer: There are no circumstances under which Trump should concede.
1327296194796728321 2020-11-14 01:04:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @SelbJim I hear you, but we might not get a second chance at this. Trump needs us to back him.
1327295869973098496 2020-11-14 01:02:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "I'm doing an audit." Doesn't actually audit anything.
1327295641148682252 2020-11-14 01:01:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @SelbJim Did Trump concede?
1327288801220325376 2020-11-14 00:34:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Call out the War Chiefs! Cowboys and Indians ride together this time!
1327287125319049223 2020-11-14 00:28:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If we don't get a reverification of the absentees, an audit of where the post-election day ballots "found" came from, etc., this whole process is a sham.
1327285041324552198 2020-11-14 00:19:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If they didn't want their votes thrown out, maybe they shouldn't have shamelessly handled them illegally according to hundreds of eyewitnesses.
1327284038575550464 2020-11-14 00:15:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK That and they were just flat out rigged.
1327279545096003588 2020-11-13 23:57:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Men of Georgia: Do not let your government be stolen from you.
1327279084443983874 2020-11-13 23:56:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The biggest clowns in this whole process are those that think the Republican Party will go back to business as usual post-Trump.
1327273121645211650 2020-11-13 23:32:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Wendy Davis lost by about 6.7%. I personally enjoy every time she loses. So much Democrat money is wasted trying to get her elected.
1327272723752624128 2020-11-13 23:30:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> For all the money Democrats wasted on races in Texas, Republicans got closer to taking TX-15 than any of the Dem targets and they didn't even try.
1327270073535492102 2020-11-13 23:20:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law Are we getting a real audit or just a fake one?
1327268766368083968 2020-11-13 23:15:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Would anyone accept this excuse from a spouse?  "Just because I closed the door and was alone with that woman doesn't prove I had an affair!"
1327267949376368645 2020-11-13 23:11:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim Still 50%+1!
1327266410301681666 2020-11-13 23:05:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @unseen1_unseen @SelimSeesYou 27 million dollars on useless races.
1327265340246679553 2020-11-13 23:01:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @modestianrite We’re winning the propaganda war. The legal war has barely even started.
1327265189994123266 2020-11-13 23:00:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Someone called their buddies in Shanghai and was like “yo, we got a 100K emergency Biden ballots in Philly, don’t worry your pretty little head.”
1327264835428626432 2020-11-13 22:59:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> “There is no deep state.”  Also this:
1327264449795940353 2020-11-13 22:57:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Has Trump concede? No? Then sounds like it’s another day of fighting.
1327258616404078592 2020-11-13 22:34:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jamesmadison501 @LokiJulianus The state legislatures. The House. Keep protesting, writing letters, etc.
1327117797604941825 2020-11-13 13:15:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Miche1T @RepMattGaetz Dude is tweeting out being friend zoned.
1327117527659503616 2020-11-13 13:14:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jamesmadison501 @LokiJulianus Then make them.

Larry is definitely an optimist, but I’m not going to call him stupid. I mean he is an accomplished business historian.
1327115478033199104 2020-11-13 13:06:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob @CarlStein1984 @davidchapman141 @LarrySchweikart I don’t know think anyone expected them to rip a 100K ballots out of their ass in Wayne County.
1327113372756832258 2020-11-13 12:57:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @revjackashcraft @YouTube I tend to think on top of this, the loyalty belongs to the person of the head of state less so than any legal regime behind them. So, there’s no divine moral obligation to abide by 4 year terms.
1327110574115868672 2020-11-13 12:46:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago Savage.
1327109436545130497 2020-11-13 12:42:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal I mean, we just 73 million freaking votes. LMAO if they think we can’t pull this thing off.
1327109076036284416 2020-11-13 12:40:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal These people really just expect us to go away.
1327108846054223872 2020-11-13 12:39:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Apparently they want to make it illegal to talk about election fraud in Europe. Those guys really go all in on narrative control, don’t they?
1327106826995949570 2020-11-13 12:31:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal It’s likely unconstitutional to provide no recourse to recount.
1327106157618606083 2020-11-13 12:28:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly @MichaelZBoulos Starting to think they broke up.
1327105355625738240 2020-11-13 12:25:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou But then maybe we get BASED Rubicon Don.
1327104902271823872 2020-11-13 12:23:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FrenRapist @SelimSeesYou It technically hasn’t started yet and it will take several days. I’d give it time, but we don’t want to let up that’s for sure.
1327103366527414273 2020-11-13 12:17:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Trump’s team needs to get this sorted and fast.
1327101638868398080 2020-11-13 12:11:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It’s also unreasonable to ask for one. Typically smoking guns for actual murders aren’t in the public domain either. That doesn’t mean you can’t have an opinion on whodunnit.
1327101228514414592 2020-11-13 12:09:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you’re looking for a smoking gun on election fraud, you will never find it in the public domain. There’s a lot of suspicious stuff you can point to, but the “here’s the body and the bullet that killed him along with the gun” isn’t hiding on some internet post somewhere.
1327100356917125120 2020-11-13 12:05:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 That was this morning.
1327099592228425731 2020-11-13 12:02:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LarrySchweikart The Bible is the Bible. It’s all the same God.
1327096572019085314 2020-11-13 11:50:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @radiationorgan This is true, so the prophet Alex Jones saith.
1327096160125849600 2020-11-13 11:49:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @radiationorgan I like most forms of alcohol unless it’s overly hoppy beer.
1327095936120725505 2020-11-13 11:48:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DKaiserjager @Wolfgang18842 In some ways he was more successful than Perot despite his lower popular vote share. If he had ran a slightly more strategic campaign (he insisted on visiting all 50 states), he likely could have forced the election into the House.
1327095474634035201 2020-11-13 11:46:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GoogleAgorism @Wizard_Predicts It’s missing a few premises, but the logic isn’t necessarily circular.
1327095020495761408 2020-11-13 11:44:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DKaiserjager @Wolfgang18842 Perot 92 was higher in the popular vote, but Wallace 68 got electors and that’s kind of a big deal. Last third party to win a state.
1327094308881788928 2020-11-13 11:41:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 If they threw away the ballot envelopes, they committed a felony and invalidated the election. We will be able to find this.
1327092003889434624 2020-11-13 11:32:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Stay upbeat! I’ve had more fun after than I did before to be honest.
1327091585243357185 2020-11-13 11:31:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jondutoit This was my big objection. I’ve heard you couldn’t share links without an ID? I don’t know, I haven’t tried.
1327090144176959488 2020-11-13 11:25:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So my brother had some nice Cabernet Sauvignon while eating ramen noodles tonight. Peak bachelor life.
1327089557091790849 2020-11-13 11:23:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Filmerian1 @Nick_B_Steves I appreciate having two intelligent people here agree with me on this. Hopefully God gives him strength in the coming days and weeks.
1327080402197024768 2020-11-13 10:46:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They probably baked in about 5 million fraud votes before the election even started.
1327080222009724930 2020-11-13 10:45:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal I follow this stuff and there’s so much going on it’s still difficult to keep track.
1327079830073077760 2020-11-13 10:44:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Is there an audit in Wisconsin or just a “recount”?
1327076348683309063 2020-11-13 10:30:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WickedTewi He hasn’t fired Fauci yet.
1327072873354235906 2020-11-13 10:16:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It’s amazing people believe stuff like this. This guy would be lucky to get 10% in the South Carolina Primary.
1327068930511429632 2020-11-13 10:01:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Does Donald know Tiffany is Matt’s beard?
1327068549773398017 2020-11-13 09:59:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan So I said.
1327067854944997377 2020-11-13 09:56:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is wrong.
1327065955248332803 2020-11-13 09:49:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Sailingceo @Peoples_Pundit I didn’t call you establishment. I said that the establishment doesn’t like people like us because of people like you who throw people under the bus because of a 5 minute FNC segment that didn’t meet your lofty standards.
1327065286781116418 2020-11-13 09:46:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I would just like to remind Big Eva that Trump beat his own record for most Evangelical votes of any Presidential candidate.
1327064855757656065 2020-11-13 09:44:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Sailingceo @Peoples_Pundit Sir, I’m a Christian. I don’t judge people based on what they might do in the future.
1327063147514122240 2020-11-13 09:38:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Sailingceo It was a less than five minute Tucker segment. @Peoples_Pundit has always been reserved in his statements. Just getting exposure might get more people to listen to the podcast and hear more.
1327062689261248512 2020-11-13 09:36:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 Fight!
1327062108354334720 2020-11-13 09:33:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I remind everyone again one reason some GOP establishment types don’t like insurgents is their haste to throw even their friends under the bus.
1327061565519126528 2020-11-13 09:31:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 Has Trump conceded?
1327060602917937152 2020-11-13 09:27:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Can anyone stop by and give our man @davidchapman141 some white pills? He seems to be on a real downer these days.
1327059961344626690 2020-11-13 09:25:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Not much said by @Peoples_Pundit other than a fraud investigator has the information.
1327058363302211586 2020-11-13 09:19:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> STOP THE STEAL
1327058030937174016 2020-11-13 09:17:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OfficialDavidNC Having Florida in the bag is nice.
1327057046408196098 2020-11-13 09:13:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The left has no shame.
1327052632465289217 2020-11-13 08:56:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> He’s going on Tucker!
1327048255616790528 2020-11-13 08:38:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Biden transition team is just a grift sign Hunter can get more crack money.
1327041983303573505 2020-11-13 08:13:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The FNC’s House calls in 2018 and 2020 were such a blatant instance of journalistic malpractice and electioneering it’s ridiculous. It’s one thing to say “the Democrats look like they’ll take the House.” It’s another to “project” it when all the polls aren’t even closed.
1327038652459999235 2020-11-13 08:00:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I mean, really? Lmao. Once again: These kind of brazen lies only highlight the dishonesty of the institution saying it. Mail in voting just *is* insecure lmao. It’s a feature, not a bug.
1327031075454013440 2020-11-13 07:30:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I didn’t think he could get 73 million a month ago. If you would have told me he’d get 73 million AND LOSE, I’d have thought you were nuts. Of course, we know he really didn’t.
1327028524390166528 2020-11-13 07:20:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Remember this glorious moment last week.

1327017005061431298 2020-11-13 06:34:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp They also lack basic understanding of incentives for the other action: The Emirates is a tiny nation utterly dependent on us for their defense. They're not going to harbor Trump if Biden wants him: Treaty or not. Laws are strongly worded suggestions to the Emir of Dubai.
1327015824675262465 2020-11-13 06:30:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I mean, these people don't even understand the concept of a mortgage and secured debt. They really think Trump's 400 million in debt is some massive burden and that he's desperate for some last minute bribes. Also, the Emirates would never burden themselves with that, I guarantee
1327014847863803910 2020-11-13 06:26:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp It basically amounts to "Cheetoh Hitler became President to get rich and hate immigrants. The HYPOCRITE now wants to move to escape JUSTICE."
1327014541083938817 2020-11-13 06:24:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @uhhhhhhhhhhhuh The New York Attorney General has been investigating this for years, actually. Has found exactly nothing.
1327014096865288194 2020-11-13 06:23:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There's a conspiracy theory going around on the left that Trump is trying to move to the UAE because it has no extradition treaty.
1327011809438609416 2020-11-13 06:14:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Charlemagne_03 This type of moment is literally why the Romans had the Office of Dictator.
1327008718005919746 2020-11-13 06:01:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Governor Abrams of Georgia awards their electors to Donald Trump. Says she knows how it feels to have an election stolen.
1327008460995760128 2020-11-13 06:00:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Charlemagne_03 Eh, that's still better than Biden, but I still get what you mean.
1327006737048739841 2020-11-13 05:53:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Suicide rates in the US are at an all-time high. Could 2 friends please copy and re-post this tweet? We’re trying to demonstrate that someone is always listening.   Call 1-800-273-8255 (USA hotline)  Just two. Any two. Copy, not retweet
1327006379710812161 2020-11-13 05:52:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 .03%: Basically none.
1327006280205160450 2020-11-13 05:52:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton @Peoples_Pundit He is, but he didn't do his daily podcast today. Think the man has been overworked.
1327005982313091073 2020-11-13 05:50:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ori_Ar @SK90_FL Supposedly she's dating Michael Boulos.
1327004058092253189 2020-11-13 05:43:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GTaroia @Peoples_Pundit He didn't do his Podcast today.
1327003910364663810 2020-11-13 05:42:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lady_Astor Be careful. A lot of fake accounts going around to make us look bad.
1327003608060137474 2020-11-13 05:41:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm not going to get my @Peoples_Pundit fix today and I'm sad.
1327003479659909120 2020-11-13 05:40:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lady_Astor It's a fake.
1327002993032617986 2020-11-13 05:39:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL She pulled the "only emoji" RT.
1327002045195423751 2020-11-13 05:35:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All these fake accounts are indicative of a psyop.
1327000053836361728 2020-11-13 05:27:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So the Tiffany Trump-Matt Gaetz ship is real?
1326999647378960386 2020-11-13 05:25:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly It was a message from Bibi.
1326992791684132871 2020-11-13 04:58:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Did you know people have different opinions about a thing that happened?
1326991526581465092 2020-11-13 04:53:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @TRPolitics_ @MattZupon All strategically located in places with no election integrity.
1326990739864215553 2020-11-13 04:50:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing The only state you see it much at all it Utah, but Romney is ridiculously personally popular there and it's still a 20+ point Trump win.
1326988906710118407 2020-11-13 04:43:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing Trump is doing better across the board except for the fraud states and we all know. There's like 3 or 4 states where he might have genuinely lost share and they're all deep blue and it was very small.
1326988308799516674 2020-11-13 04:40:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing You can tell Trump passed the prior shit tests by women voting for him in larger numbers.
1326987918091702274 2020-11-13 04:39:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This election is just another shit test for the Trump Administration.
1326987069755961356 2020-11-13 04:35:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago I drank more alcohol in my few months in Abu Dhabi in 2018-19 than I probably have in the rest of my life combined lol. I know that was the state of affairs in the Abu Dhabi Emirate for many years.
1326986394846289920 2020-11-13 04:33:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago No: Alcohol was allowed in every Emirate outside Sharjah. Even in Sharjah, it was allowed, just under extremely strict regulations.
1326985822898307072 2020-11-13 04:30:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago The UAE has never banned alcohol and their religious police have always been a joke.
1326984618017517570 2020-11-13 04:26:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @CarlStein1984 It's basically one big game of chicken: They're basically demanding the GOP accept this wholesale illegality as a fait accompli by making it impossible to distinguish good from bad ballots. The question is the GOP (including justices) have the balls to tell them "no."
1326983518241611789 2020-11-13 04:21:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 It wouldn't surprise me if they did, but if they did this is almost too easy to just throw out hundreds of thousands of Biden votes as flat illegal.
1326982115293093888 2020-11-13 04:16:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CaesarSalad99 Lib chimpout is what I crave.
1326981836032139272 2020-11-13 04:14:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CaesarSalad99 I genuinely think the fraud is pretty obvious, but we're at the point where people are looking for smoking guns and we're just not going to find them in the public domain.
1326981373320683520 2020-11-13 04:13:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I keep seeing people saying this, but there are two separate envelopes with a typical mail in ballot and one of them is basically just a sheet of paper to protect ballot secrecy. Did they destroy the relevant envelopes or just the secrecy envelopes? The former would be a felony.
1326979616800731143 2020-11-13 04:06:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy It affects a few thousand votes in the running tally if I've heard correctly. Key point is that the Secretary of State can't change Election Law. I don't think they'll do this, but that could theoretically invalidate every mail in vote.
1326976421143711746 2020-11-13 03:53:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "Democrats are the real racists" rhetoric is right about one thing: Democrats do not care at all what happens to Black people if they can continue to use them for political gain. Just a fact.
1326974696517210115 2020-11-13 03:46:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Thank you, @RonPaul, for making anti-war conservatism great again.
1326973450238484486 2020-11-13 03:41:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The extremely conservative bump is from falling for FBI stings.
1326972944778747904 2020-11-13 03:39:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @vegangolfgirl @Robertl01464344 He's probably referring to his plagiarism scandal.
1326967320112222210 2020-11-13 03:17:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's official: The dinosaurs have returned in yet another sign of the chaos of 2020.
1326966090870747136 2020-11-13 03:12:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @theeternalright Yes, that's a very good point. Could lead to potentially large amounts of ballot disqualifications on other legal technicalities later.
1326965496579829760 2020-11-13 03:10:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @thehangingchads The ruling is about ballots that weren't cured by November 9th, not all post-election ballots.
1326965362534060032 2020-11-13 03:09:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theeternalright @thehangingchads I think there are 2000 in Allegheny County. I haven't heard about others. It might significantly shave off the margin which will make the rest of the process easier.
1326964342772932620 2020-11-13 03:05:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads First of many, I hope. This doesn't affect too many votes unfortunately.
1326963339487031296 2020-11-13 03:01:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou It was literally all just a predicate for the mass vote theft that occurred in the six fraud states.
1326962048530526210 2020-11-13 02:56:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The whole gang is going to be at the big rally!
1326961090480234499 2020-11-13 02:52:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Donald Trump reads a room better than this.
1326958842178138113 2020-11-13 02:43:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK We're all in, brother.
1326955378203037697 2020-11-13 02:29:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago Either way, really.
1326951705045577736 2020-11-13 02:15:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KGCreal @realikamusume @Davelevy23 @Stoner_68 Kern does use Dominion. If that's true, it would explain the shift almost entirely.
1326951347187556352 2020-11-13 02:13:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Miche1T @HeritageNLegacy I'm all in here. This is certainly our last best chance to save the country and potentially the western world from the Amazon pod bug food future. I honestly really don't care if I end up with egg on my face.
1326946650112319491 2020-11-13 01:55:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @KGCreal @Davelevy23 @Stoner_68 Or in Valadao’s district, a part of which I believe is in Kern County.
1326946512753012737 2020-11-13 01:54:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KGCreal @realikamusume @Davelevy23 @Stoner_68 We won back the pro-Trump Valadao seat on Trump Latinos, though. Confused.
1326942765507358720 2020-11-13 01:39:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Just to reiterate the position: We’re with Trump however he chooses to handle this crisis.
1326942690232201217 2020-11-13 01:39:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Just to reiterate the position: We’re with Trump however he chooses to handle this crisis.
1326941978135769088 2020-11-13 01:36:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Sorry, a lot of us just don’t trust anyone else. Certainly not people who have been around forever. If we can find someone else who hasn’t been around, then I’m obviously open to it.
1326940987013419008 2020-11-13 01:32:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is why I tend to think he can run again in 2024 if he chose to do so.
1326938180252291074 2020-11-13 01:21:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wandlearner @Real_Adam_B @ConceptualJames  https://t.co/1f0rYPoxCv
1326935699766063105 2020-11-13 01:11:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Margins don't really matter when the absolute share of the vote is still a majority and increasing. What tends to happen in these deep red/blue states is the non-dominant vote contains a lot more protest than usual. Biden is still well below Obama's margin in this state.
1326934376542851073 2020-11-13 01:06:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Trump was on par in Alabama (62.08% to 62.16%) and only lost 1% share in Madison and 3% in Shelby.
1326933475581186048 2020-11-13 01:02:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 Yes, but if they think Trump has gone of the rocker, now would be the time to start distancing. Trump won't keep much base if he goes all in with irrational narratives.
1326932540498833410 2020-11-13 00:59:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad They would, but only as a remedial matter after certified.
1326932333879029767 2020-11-13 00:58:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> On the one hand: Trump going all in with the Dominion thing is a very risky move that could damage America First.  On the other hand: The GOP is still behind him except the usual suspects. If they didn't think Trump had a case, they should be distancing themselves more.
1326931694235119616 2020-11-13 00:55:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad Arizona has a Democratic extremely anti-Trump Secretary of State and that's more relevant to election fraud.
1326930767881117699 2020-11-13 00:52:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @SelimSeesYou Oh, the Chinese would have helped. That we can almost be assured of. Biden is their guy after all: A literal Manchurian Candidate.
1326929505248813056 2020-11-13 00:47:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou As someone who used to play a lot of poker: This really feels like a moment you're watching two players raise each other and you legit have no idea who's the maniac and who's the guy with the nut hand (best possible cards).
1326928119488520192 2020-11-13 00:41:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DKaiserjager If Georgia show a huge discrepancy, it will force others to do the same.
1326927930132402176 2020-11-13 00:40:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ZokharSarniev My position is clear: I support the President until he chooses to give up the fight. When he says stuff like this, it really needs to come out or he will lose a lot of trust and potentially damage our cause if he doesn't prevail.
1326927683062788097 2020-11-13 00:39:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theeternalright A hand recount would resolve stuff like this. It's actually extremely easy to prove or disprove. However, we will see. I'm not holding my breath on this one. Fraudulent mail ins and mysterious midnight 97% Biden dumps seem the most fruitful path.
1326927115321667584 2020-11-13 00:37:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DKaiserjager Well, the audits and even a hand recount would theoretically show this.
1326926166075338752 2020-11-13 00:33:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These brazen bastards.
1326925468667404288 2020-11-13 00:30:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @harb_degelivirP @Davelevy23 The South was ridiculously swingy from 1960-2000. It would go from big margin Democrat to big margin Republican and back again.
1326925062012809217 2020-11-13 00:29:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed @AviWoolf The way you are speaking of is nominating Kelly Loeffler, who will now be hammered about her sales of hospitality stocks in February. She will drag down Perdue if the audit doesn't put him over the top.
1326924256345804801 2020-11-13 00:26:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @harb_degelivirP @Davelevy23 @realikamusume Ohio does too. Time will tell with Florida.
1326924033661804548 2020-11-13 00:25:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think this really tells you all you need to know about rust belt turnout.
1326923139863998464 2020-11-13 00:21:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Pozzidonius1 The only two prior times an incumbent got more votes and lost were 1840 (insane turnout increase of 22% and the PopVote didn't matter as much) and 1888, which is known to have been stolen through bribes in Indiana.
1326917854164299776 2020-11-13 00:00:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks The system is so corrupt at this point, it does seem imperative to either radically reform it ensure integrity or to simply throw it off completely when the opportunity presents itself. And it is presenting itself right now.
1326916868377112579 2020-11-12 23:56:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Keep the pressure on them, men of Georgia.
1326914197087793156 2020-11-12 23:46:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Literally all you have to do to get the top of the food chain on the right to back down is call them racist or a conspiracy theorist and they become shrinking violets.
1326912912645107714 2020-11-12 23:41:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Even if you're not sure if fraud has been committed, from a right-wing standpoint you should at least be using the momentum of this to pressure for significant electoral reform to prevent it from happening. Of course, conservatives are perennial losers.
1326910895189004291 2020-11-12 23:33:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's the struggle, I assure you.
1326906928455446535 2020-11-12 23:17:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It was justified to defeat the Orange Man. His policies made lawyers in NYC pay slightly higher prices on some random goods and this a complete travesty of justice. Probably immoral even.
1326904905718784000 2020-11-12 23:09:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Maybe we wouldn't be in this mess if dummies on the right hadn't been attacking the President for not pulling a miracle out of his ass. How many votes did Trump lose because of that? Enough to make the difference in Arizona, I'd bet, and that'd give us more momentum here.
1326903047948283904 2020-11-12 23:01:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @Davelevy23 @Stoner_68 I don't get the numbers out of Kern County to be honest. It's literally an oil town and they swung towards Biden? What?
1326901949787213825 2020-11-12 22:57:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Davelevy23 @Stoner_68 @realikamusume This election there actually was, though. Illinois and New York are a lot closer this cycle.
1326901807763873794 2020-11-12 22:56:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @Davelevy23 The PMC is just antithetical to the America First Agenda because PMCs thrive on low consumer goods prices. There's just only so much we can do about that. And Trump really drove rural turnout: I'm not sure how much more he could have really done.
1326899111757484032 2020-11-12 22:46:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Davelevy23 @realikamusume Colorado is the dude, weed crowd.
1326898977518784522 2020-11-12 22:45:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Davelevy23 @realikamusume I'm not convinced about Georgia. For one thing, let's see what the audit says. Secondly, Virginia has the FedGov employee factor, which Obama made solid blue.
1326897974258130946 2020-11-12 22:41:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume This was a very low turnout election and Virginia was nowhere near as blue as it is today.
1326894876210966528 2020-11-12 22:29:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The absolute last office you should allow a Democrat to hold is the Secretary of State’s office.
1326759789888671746 2020-11-12 13:32:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright @SelimSeesYou I’d be extremely cautious with anyone claiming they have a smoking gun that isn’t from the campaign themselves and making a public pronouncement.
1326759007143518209 2020-11-12 13:29:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright @SelimSeesYou I mean, math is math. It’s just really hard to prove a lot of this stuff without access to the original ballots.
1326755340197765126 2020-11-12 13:14:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Math_oma Star Wars has an absolute fire soundtrack, though.
1326754886965452801 2020-11-12 13:13:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FlippantSol No.
1326753630490398722 2020-11-12 13:08:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis The Federal Government has become a grotesque monstrosity that exists mainly for the purpose of expanding its own power at this point. Her policies actively harm Americans.
1326751417206444033 2020-11-12 12:59:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just believe our country has been rotting from the central government for decades and Trump is the only guy who has shown any willingness at all to even acknowledge the problem.
1326749196523868160 2020-11-12 12:50:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Orange Cheetoh Hitler always wins, guys.
1326748449887367168 2020-11-12 12:47:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Mack_J_Devlin @Pozzidonius1 @SelimSeesYou The people in Cleveland knew Biden had no chance in Ohio against Cheetoh Hitler, so they stayed home. The people in Milwaukee knew it was their divine duty to defeat Cheetoh Hitler, though.
1326745532983881730 2020-11-12 12:35:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf This is just going to be a long slog. I was hoping to get a few victories without massive legal battles. This would be a lot easier if we only needed one or two states to flip. Right now we need three.   My position on conceding, though, cannot be clearer I think.
1326741488034869249 2020-11-12 12:19:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Mack_J_Devlin @Pozzidonius1 @SelimSeesYou But only in a few key swing states.
1326741329062354944 2020-11-12 12:19:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Pozzidonius1 @SelimSeesYou I honestly think Biden's performance is skewed nationally by these key areas too. There's a few of them nationally that just don't make a whole lot of sense.
1326737898775908354 2020-11-12 12:05:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 @Theobservin It's going to be hard just to put it into auto recount territory.
1326737798121009154 2020-11-12 12:05:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperWars If Trump hasn't conceded, neither will I.
1326737653501407234 2020-11-12 12:04:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theobservin Still got some out, but no way they'll break enough for Trump. We will need some further evidence before we can overturn this.
1326737323334246400 2020-11-12 12:03:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperWars The election. Arizona coming through would have been a big aid.
1326736976939278339 2020-11-12 12:01:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan He's behind by about 4500 votes. Really weird: A lot of people seemed to have skipped that race entirely. Maybe people just don't like him and there was no way to make that up.
1326735990183092226 2020-11-12 11:58:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'll be honest: The Arizona debacle is probably the worst news so far in this debacle.   However, if what we believe is true actually is, then it will be uncovered in time.
1326735376183152641 2020-11-12 11:55:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If there's some good news from Arizona it's that Fontes will no longer plague us for sure after this election.
1326733925163610112 2020-11-12 11:49:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The mere fact this article from 2014 exists proves that Trump isn't responsible for people thinking elections are rigged. This is clearly a long term consensus people have had and most ordinary people just believe it. It all does seem very staged to the average person.
1326731986057224192 2020-11-12 11:42:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The thing is that turnout is freaking off the charts in just the right places for them. This isn't an even turnout increase.
1326731491037032449 2020-11-12 11:40:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Man, you called for Trump to assemble the War Chiefs earlier today. Not sure how much more Fedposty that gets.
1326731200208248832 2020-11-12 11:39:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Hurry up, call Arizona for Biden to dispirit the Trumpers. It's ogre!
1326729252558004224 2020-11-12 11:31:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Truth_Reaction Yeah, Rudy likes to mouth off.

1326728277638180870 2020-11-12 11:27:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I imagine we intended to use the fraudsmithing against other countries and not ourselves originally.
1326727993104994304 2020-11-12 11:26:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LikeStojakovic The Scorecard is the idea they were just flat robbing Trump with election software strategically in GOP friendly counties/precincts.
1326727469047668737 2020-11-12 11:24:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LikeStojakovic I just would really like this Scorecard thing to be real to put this shit to bed.
1326726305786851328 2020-11-12 11:19:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I thought we had the whistleblowers.
1326725807281221632 2020-11-12 11:17:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> From the standpoint of an investigator: We have means, motive, opportunity, a confession. Literally all we're doing is trying to identify the murder weapon(s) and the body.
1326724952813395971 2020-11-12 11:14:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LikeStojakovic @RonaldKlain @voxdotcom How is this even real?
1326724457105395712 2020-11-12 11:12:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We have a confession.
1326724086081458181 2020-11-12 11:10:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Yep, it is.
1326720257910853633 2020-11-12 10:55:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GunthBeethoven @Charlemagne_03 Certainly is if you watched Boston Legal.
1326720153468481538 2020-11-12 10:55:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Charlemagne_03 It's also just a show he does. Like, it's not like this is some official campaign briefing.
1326719852145479680 2020-11-12 10:53:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy I think what happened is that basically everyone realized Covid was like 90% BS over the course of September and October.
1326716144116510720 2020-11-12 10:39:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 Yeah, none of it makes sense.
1326715598081024000 2020-11-12 10:37:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy That Covid caused anti-Trump hysteria?
1326714937977282562 2020-11-12 10:34:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The only reasonable explanation for the rust belt trending against Ohio and Iowa this election is Covid restrictions causing Covid hysteria in those states. The problem is that Blue states with Covid restriction in general have trended red.
1326713726238646275 2020-11-12 10:29:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @SelimSeesYou We still have the paper ballots and they can't be destroyed for 22 months after election day by Federal law.
1326713546026180608 2020-11-12 10:28:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The typical response to "my guy sucks" is to stay home, not vote for other dude because Orange Cheetoh Hitler Blumpf must be stopped.
1326712958492282880 2020-11-12 10:26:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou They actually just reran the ballots through their machine after recalibrating it. So, if the Scorecard thing is still true, they would still be affected by it.
1326710987223937025 2020-11-12 10:18:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden I heard she was actually fired yesterday.
1326710168026050560 2020-11-12 10:15:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf @JayFiveK That's true, but I'd support him if he did it and I don't think the American people will care either.
1326709508203286528 2020-11-12 10:12:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf @JayFiveK Disagree about being too old. It would depend on the state of his mental health.
1326708829627813889 2020-11-12 10:10:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @20_mockingbird @BobbyHe45365937 @realikamusume Doesn't it depend on how mentally healthy the person is? Plenty of Senators in their 80s are still with it.
1326708627005124608 2020-11-12 10:09:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @realikamusume Absolutely.
1326708268044005379 2020-11-12 10:07:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @realikamusume The only way I can see Trump conceding are guarantees he'll be allowed to run again and assurances from the GOP they'll pass integrity laws. That's the only way I'm seeing it.
1326707808428027906 2020-11-12 10:06:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @realikamusume We could absolutely force GOP state legislatures (of which we control nearly all the relevant ones) to pass strong election integrity laws.

1326685110675116038 2020-11-12 08:35:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan The Trump Camp.

1326684657337950208 2020-11-12 08:34:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Isn’t some announcement supposedly coming down the pike at 9 PM?

1326681179651788802 2020-11-12 08:20:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Exactly why we CANNOT concede.
1326680931613151232 2020-11-12 08:19:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They probably could have gotten away with it if they hadn’t gone nuclear with the purges in the week after the election. Seriously, offer a freaking olive branch dummies.

1326673476518891521 2020-11-12 07:49:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RoyalistW Florida is very hard to pull off much fraud. Maybe a few hundred absentee ballots at most, but not the tens of thousands they are alleging.
1326672983864320000 2020-11-12 07:47:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RoyalistW I want to compare states with known election integrity against states whose elections are doubtful. Virginia is in the latter camp.
1326672036203278337 2020-11-12 07:43:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GarrettFAdams Iowa and Ohio for sure. Very confident in the integrity of those elections.
1326671106577752064 2020-11-12 07:40:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mauritaniamike Everyone assumes Dems cheat. I don’t think anyone ever believed it could be done at the level it appears to have been done here.
1326669997092036608 2020-11-12 07:35:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mauritaniamike True. I don’t think anyone is doubting the integrity of either of those elections.
1326668963015774209 2020-11-12 07:31:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> How many Biden only ballots were there in Florida? Would be revealing.
1326668576246419456 2020-11-12 07:30:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They got less votes. Flat true.
1326660177043599360 2020-11-12 06:56:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThePhoneRebel @RealAPolitics Main point is they're open to voting Democrat down ballot more than up ballot.
1326657786462302208 2020-11-12 06:47:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Obviously hasn't heard of Southern legacy Democrats. The type of people that vote for Trump and McConnell and then vote for the Beshears.
1326656458101035008 2020-11-12 06:42:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed There was definitely some low key calling them racists. Also, Hillary was robbed of that nod. I'd feel bad, but it's Hillary Clinton.
1326656093645312002 2020-11-12 06:40:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Mssr_le_Baron Not fully, but the Trump platform definitely has critical mass to accomplish this regardless of the outcome of this election.
1326655290142564353 2020-11-12 06:37:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lady_Astor @Uncle_Muscle He is, ultimately, a left-liberal. While he isn't a complete psychopath, there are things he'll just be wrong on.
1326654227415003137 2020-11-12 06:33:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump is very much like Caesar on a political philosophy level: A Populare with a conservative bent. That's why Trump was able to get a critical mass to essentially seize control of the Republican Party: Enough of the Optimates are on sympathetic to his cause to take charge.
1326652628097519616 2020-11-12 06:26:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The duties of a Head of State are inalterable on a high moral level, but you can practically limit their authority for the sake of good government.
1326652205902934021 2020-11-12 06:25:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is still my position and that will not change because it's less about the present crisis and more about my larger political philosophy.
1326651009914052610 2020-11-12 06:20:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 Regardless, this is an oddity that should be looked into. Who are these voters?
1326649517840666626 2020-11-12 06:14:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Nate Silver doesn't understand the concept of a "hostile witness." Trumpists think of the media as a "hostile witness." When they confirm things for us, it's given a lot more weight than when they say the opposite.
1326649026834558977 2020-11-12 06:12:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 Honestly think it could have been bigger.
1326648716225376258 2020-11-12 06:11:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReformedMallard There are two types of ballot envelopes in a mail in ballot, one it is ok to destroy as it just protects the ballots' secrecy. Another would be a violation of Federal law to destroy until 22 months have passed.
1326647785916162052 2020-11-12 06:07:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ori_Ar You might be right about the latter, but Dems fall on the sword all the time and the 2022 map is not favorable to the GOP.
1326647585466159105 2020-11-12 06:06:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TrustThePlant I keep seeing people point to random votes he sides correctly. Never once is he *the* deciding vote and people just don't seem to get that. He has been the deciding vote for things his state does not like.
1326644445803143176 2020-11-12 05:54:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @SelimSeesYou Yeah, I'm hoping something big breaks before the end of the Georgia audit.
1326643182675894272 2020-11-12 05:49:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @SelimSeesYou Geez, I hope not. Everyone's all in here. If Trump doesn't come through with something, there ain't no 2024 I can tell you that.
1326642423460663299 2020-11-12 05:46:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Agreed. They shall also get a sizable number of delegates to the RNC. Whoever can prove themselves to be the most MAGA candidate through a series of trials shall be deemed worthy.
1326641846139953154 2020-11-12 05:43:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 👀
1326640061383925763 2020-11-12 05:36:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou My suspicion is they wouldn't be doing this if the Trump team wasn't passing along info and ready for this. The margin is relatively big.   My *hope* (it is just hope) is that the reason Kemp and SoS were absent last week was to let them think they'd get away with the sham.
1326636975030480896 2020-11-12 05:24:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan I think they tried, but the margin was just too big and North Carolina elections are generally a pretty clean affair. Not Florida clean, but clean.
1326635775203680258 2020-11-12 05:19:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We do think there was fraud in North Carolina, duh.
1326630759256494082 2020-11-12 04:59:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NotTheDeepStat1 @AnnCoulter There are 237 affidavits in the Michigan lawsuit. I don't care how many media reports deny it. They're not sources.
1326630258699886592 2020-11-12 04:57:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PrinceCrispin @realkingprep It's close. That, and a lot of us are convinced a few of these races were probably stolen. Including Sean Parnell in PA and Freitas in Virginia.
1326629553872261122 2020-11-12 04:55:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NotTheDeepStat1 @AnnCoulter Affidavits are not hearsay.
1326629439371960320 2020-11-12 04:54:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @radiationorgan @AnnCoulter That’s true, but the Pop and Wignat narrative of this election just isn’t born out in numbers and they just flat misrepresent these agendas. The Platinum Plan is an infrastructure plan and it would be unconstitutional if it merely helped Black people get money.
1326628941176696840 2020-11-12 04:52:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NotTheDeepStat1 @AnnCoulter Witness affidavits are evidence whether you like it or not.
1326628308801499142 2020-11-12 04:50:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I don’t think so.
1326627442858094594 2020-11-12 04:46:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NotTheDeepStat1 @AnnCoulter Haha...yeah, no.
1326626145253666816 2020-11-12 04:41:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnnCoulter Trump 205K more votes in Wisconsin AT LEAST, Ann. Stop with this BS. Maybe some random wignats stayed home over this but the vast majority of ordinary WWC don’t care.
1326623022518849537 2020-11-12 04:29:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright The IG’s job is basically this: Cover up real corruption while harassing random makework bureaucrats about missing pencils.
1326622137650728961 2020-11-12 04:25:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @radiationorgan Yeah, the down ballot skips happen, but not too this level.
1326621013724065793 2020-11-12 04:21:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @yemanouspeak Agreed.
1326620608482914309 2020-11-12 04:19:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @radiationorgan Like maybe some extremely fringe group of Biden/Perdue NeverTrumpers, but they’d still vote. Biden only? Nearly 100K? Ridiculous.
1326619822973718529 2020-11-12 04:16:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MarcusShrinking I think part of it is also just that they were overwhelmed by the sheer number of votes Trump received.
1326619403652374536 2020-11-12 04:14:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is why FNC is allowing some mention of the fraud on their primetime.
1326618859584049153 2020-11-12 04:12:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’d buy the GOP’s overperforming in Senate and House races if so many of these votes weren’t Biden only and that’s basically the only reason Trump “underperformed” the Congressional GOP. Real fraudster could have made this look real good and mark some ballots Biden/Perdue.
1326618028184907777 2020-11-12 04:09:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So sloppy.
1326617351400382471 2020-11-12 04:06:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics I counted ballots once (at a caucus). It wasn’t hard.
1326616622434557954 2020-11-12 04:03:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MrValance @SelimSeesYou There should be two separate envelopes in a mail in ballot: An outer envelope that verified the vote is legitimate and an inner secrecy envelope that gets destroyed once opened. You verify the ballot, separate the secrecy envelope and throw it into a pile.
1326614366423277568 2020-11-12 03:54:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago @RupertVonRipp Turnout is 100% of the population? WHO CARES!
1326614140581015552 2020-11-12 03:53:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago @RupertVonRipp They might just be that desperate: All for one last gambit. No holds barred. Print fake ballots until you literally run out of ink.
1326613534885769216 2020-11-12 03:51:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If Democrats didn’t want their supposedly legitimate election results thrown out and thrown to pro-Trump legislatures, maybe they should have followed the law.
1326612685455323136 2020-11-12 03:48:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MosleyGang @RupertVonRipp That’s going to be a tall ask.
1326610753500155909 2020-11-12 03:40:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou A world where every dead White man in the states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan had someone vote for them. They were all very loyal Democrats and should have their ghostly voice heard about Cheetoh Hitler.
1326608863471292416 2020-11-12 03:32:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 Stop. Just stop.
1326607972282363904 2020-11-12 03:29:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton @RupertVonRipp  https://t.co/5h5HfIX3gT
1326607722914123779 2020-11-12 03:28:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp We give them the stones. If you’re in Pennsylvania, rally in Harrisburg now.
1326607233388597252 2020-11-12 03:26:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Throw the ballots out. Yes, some legit ballots will get thrown out, but it really shouldn’t matter to you. These people violated an order of the Supreme Court.
1326606168261865472 2020-11-12 03:22:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Just imagine what kind of landslide re-election Trump would have received if we had a halfway honest media.
1326604647172354048 2020-11-12 03:16:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottonTurtle9 Yeah. All we can do is put our trust in the Lord that righteousness will prevail.
1326603741156552708 2020-11-12 03:12:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottonTurtle9 The Secretary of State’s office, and there should be party officials from both parties involved.
1326603557852884994 2020-11-12 03:11:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lauraka09619649 I say: Thank you for your service. LMAO.
1326603318588809217 2020-11-12 03:10:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> True.
1326603050837012480 2020-11-12 03:09:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL Hopefully we get reports of good news before then.
1326602903944110082 2020-11-12 03:09:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lauraka09619649 “We need to re-educate these people because they voted for Cheetoh Hitler.”
1326602248181456896 2020-11-12 03:06:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Anyone know how long until the Georgia audit is done? We’re really banking on that right now.
1326601093909016578 2020-11-12 03:02:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Where the white women be at?
1326597900126851078 2020-11-12 02:49:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> He’s on the case.
1326597817603907589 2020-11-12 02:49:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 This is the age, which is fairly reliable, and this is an extremely unusual number. Like many orders of magnitude over the national average. It’s 13% of the national total by itself.  https://t.co/Tdtxzv7X9G
1326596380157218816 2020-11-12 02:43:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Doll_lifeDan @JayFiveK It’s precisely that and I think some of the fraud ballots do help Ossoff. Enough for the runoff anyway.
1326570589700706307 2020-11-12 01:00:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Yes.
1326562851608256514 2020-11-12 00:30:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LikeStojakovic Yeah, he’d have at least pulled off a respectable loss without embarrassing the party. Probably lose like 51-47 or something. Would make it easier to unseat Obama in 2012.
1326561865669992448 2020-11-12 00:26:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp They really should have done it up there to make Penn more believeable.
1326561603559563266 2020-11-12 00:25:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep Justice for Malfoy!
1326561527281946633 2020-11-12 00:24:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I think they just didn’t even try in New York or something. That would make the most sense to me. Obviously NYC is well versed in the art of the election steal.
1326561123521409024 2020-11-12 00:23:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> How on Earth does upstate New York shift that far right while Penn doesn’t?
1326560269670211584 2020-11-12 00:19:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If Rudy Giuliani pulls this off, maybe he should have been the 2008 nominee.
1326556269126316040 2020-11-12 00:03:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I just hope we get some proof here. If we get something big out of Georgia by the weekend or early next week, that will give a lot of momentum.
1326555818981003264 2020-11-12 00:02:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @uhhhhhhhhhhhuh @Thamer72663870 It apparently includes an audit.
1326555649782800386 2020-11-12 00:01:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL Apparently they are doing an audit and everyone is just calling it a recount.
1326554858695036928 2020-11-11 23:58:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Ok, so they are doing an audit.
1326554160624496640 2020-11-11 23:55:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Certainly not on the scale we are alleging.
1326553658981404679 2020-11-11 23:53:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 No.
1326553554404876289 2020-11-11 23:53:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Well, if they did crap like run things through the machine multiple times and that scorecard thing is real, it could theoretically help a lot. I’m just skeptical of the Scorecard thing.
1326552874474635267 2020-11-11 23:50:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I thought this was an audit.
1326541801759498243 2020-11-11 23:06:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Something like that.
1326541329598312448 2020-11-11 23:04:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Washington, DC.
1326540926877982723 2020-11-11 23:02:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These people really expect you to believe only 3% think Trump won. LMAO.
1326394687561879552 2020-11-11 13:21:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @revjackashcraft Same...we must be on some block list.
1326392301090902016 2020-11-11 13:12:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ori_Ar @revjackashcraft These are two fundamentally incompatible forces at this point.
1326391208332111873 2020-11-11 13:08:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky @ScottMGreer Ryan, literally all a Union would do for Amazon workers is a net increase of their hourly wage by 25 cents or something. It’s not even worth the effort for actual workers anymore. These are extremely corrupt organizations and have been for some time.
1326390354111832069 2020-11-11 13:04:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @ScottMGreer They also take some money out of their workers’ paychecks and give them increasingly minor and nebulous benefits in exchange.
1326389568652931072 2020-11-11 13:01:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer Unions are systematically corrupt Democrat voting machines and were probably organizationally complicit in the systematic vote stuffing that went on.
1326388242212655106 2020-11-11 12:56:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @revjackashcraft Nikki Haley is going nowhere in the 2024 primaries. Nowhere.
1326387519785742336 2020-11-11 12:53:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Republican Party is in for a rude awakening if they think they can just go back to business as usual.
1326382254373937152 2020-11-11 12:32:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The @Peoples_Pundit ITN shows these days are essential listening:  https://t.co/2sLZM6oCE6
1326381989189070848 2020-11-11 12:31:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Mssr_le_Baron Yes, but politics is a bigger game where such things have much more dangerous consequences. Also, technically speaking Trump is calling here, so he isn't really bluffing. He would be bluff catching. Which indicates he does have some hand, even if we don't know what it is.
1326379011904335873 2020-11-11 12:19:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We know everyone here is capable of making a big bluff, but honestly I'd expect Trump to be more the more timid bluffer since he has less experience in the game.
1326378608219332619 2020-11-11 12:17:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This really does feel like one of those awkward moments when neither side is showing their hand for like a minute and we have no idea which one of them is bluffing.  Also, since Biden made the last raise, he's supposed to show his hand first, not Trump.
1326378006252826624 2020-11-11 12:15:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Don't muck your cards at showdown until you've seen your opponents hand.
1326376657880485889 2020-11-11 12:10:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FlycatcherSilky @Maga4Justice Lol.
1326374318457098241 2020-11-11 12:00:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Returned before requested ones are really odd for sure. The same day ones *could* have requested and returned it in person, the next day ones are actually slightly more suspicious than that.
1326359234376830984 2020-11-11 11:00:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Awesome.
1326357788411523072 2020-11-11 10:55:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis That would work too. Or literally any other state not called for him besides Alaska.
1326356457676304387 2020-11-11 10:49:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cigarticker MI+PA+Any other state not called for Trump right now is over 270.
1326355949175644161 2020-11-11 10:47:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnonTrump66 You must fight Adrian Fontes.
1326355862823329792 2020-11-11 10:47:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis He would just need PA and one of Wisconsin or Georgia.
1326353942431870978 2020-11-11 10:39:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 Yeah, even if he doesn't end up winning Michigan, proving some crazy 100K vote discrepancy would go a long way in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
1326353579569983489 2020-11-11 10:38:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp My main concern is they've definitely had opportunity to cover up some of the fraud. The amount that seems to have went down in Wayne County could be mind boggling, though.
1326353355250282502 2020-11-11 10:37:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Watch them overturn Michigan by next week and it doesn't even matter what happens in Arizona.
1326353005206233089 2020-11-11 10:36:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CransleyPerfume Assuming the summation is correct, I believe it would include an audit.
1326352706303385600 2020-11-11 10:35:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Usually a recount of this kind would include a full canvass at least and probable audit.
1326348317001977856 2020-11-11 10:17:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Pretty brilliant.
1326346060965572609 2020-11-11 10:08:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 Yes: I was sitting here tabulating these returns day by day, it got to 2.5 million total returns by the morning of the election. Now there are like 2.8 million in PA, nearly all the extra for Biden, and virtually none rejected for any irregularities. Excuse me for call BS on it.
1326344091848871940 2020-11-11 10:00:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Some states it is, some states it isn't. When the voter intent is absolutely crystal clear, it doesn't seem that big of a problem, but some voters absolutely intend to spoil their ballot.
1326343810884972544 2020-11-11 09:59:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OttoVonKangz It is theoretically possible that's what's going on, but ballot curing like this needs to be done with elections judges around because some voters intend to spoil their ballot.
1326343219068755969 2020-11-11 09:57:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The rejection rate on Pennsylvania mail ins is pretty damning. There's no way that high of a percentage of the mail ins were in order. That's not the case in states with universal mail in voting. Especially with what we know about the dead vote that's supposed to be rejected.
1326340959232253953 2020-11-11 09:48:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I have Joe Biden on block.
1326340826130247680 2020-11-11 09:47:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @RupertVonRipp Democrats are braindead.
1326339500042301443 2020-11-11 09:42:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp This is the first pro-Democrat polling error in Georgia's recent history I'm aware. Even McCain outperformed his polls in Georgia. JOHN MCCAIN.
1326339050534526983 2020-11-11 09:40:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nived56 The non-conspiratorial reasoning is they simply don't have the ability to rig a vote outside their counties to a great degree.
1326338509444149248 2020-11-11 09:38:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nived56 That's one plausible reason.
1326338397082963968 2020-11-11 09:38:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There was no polling error in Georgia.
1326337381071527942 2020-11-11 09:34:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheConnachtKing There's a lot of reasons, some are technical, some are nefarious. The easiest explanation is that the critical amount of box stuffing occurred in Democratically held counties and those don't usually overlap with competitive House seats.
1326336358361731079 2020-11-11 09:30:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis Maybe it can all be part of the encyclopedia entry.
1326334402738216962 2020-11-11 09:22:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 @DirkRecker7676 @Peoples_Pundit I just RT'd it.
1326333486672830472 2020-11-11 09:18:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @onewalleee My understanding is they’re usually treated like absolute shit and Trump treats them very well, which boggles my mind because these people protect your life. Least you can do is treat them with some respect.
1326333192991887360 2020-11-11 09:17:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @onewalleee To use a lolbert idea, the marshals are basically like the Federal sheriff while the FBI is your local fully militarized police department.
1326332638131589128 2020-11-11 09:15:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @onewalleee I don’t even understand why we even have an FBI when what they do is basically the Marshals’ proper job.
1326332392836116480 2020-11-11 09:14:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @onewalleee The Federal Marshals would probably gladly do it. Oh, and the Secret Service if rumors are to be believed that they love Trump.
1326331214702256129 2020-11-11 09:09:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @onewalleee Well, that describes just about everyone in the Federal Bureaucracy except the military, and IMO:  The Federal Marshals  CBP Officers ICE Agents *Some* DEA guys  Just about everyone else is PMC.
1326330040632696835 2020-11-11 09:04:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @onewalleee This is the Postal Inspector General, not the FBI. Inspector Generals' offices are terrible: They are a classic example of Anarcho-Tyranny: Obsessed with the minutiae of counting of every pencil that goes missing, but complicit in covering up large scale fraud and corruption.
1326329010150912001 2020-11-11 09:00:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @kear_nik And Freitas would have been a strong Trump ally.
1326328948163305472 2020-11-11 09:00:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @kear_nik Yeah, Spanberger is definitely in the margin of fraud.

1326327824333090818 2020-11-11 08:56:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JTLegionaire @Peoples_Pundit To be fair, Presidents always do more in Term 2 on this front, but the thing about the Trump Admin is it’s a fundamental break with the standard Washington Business. It needed to be more radical from day one.
1326326489789460481 2020-11-11 08:50:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JTLegionaire @Peoples_Pundit He needs to clean house in the whole government. This is the type of situation that Ancient Romans had the office of Dictator to address. Someone just gets 6 months to fix everything. Not saying that’s what we do now, but that’s the gravity of the situation.
1326325449446875140 2020-11-11 08:46:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Peoples_Pundit Of course the Feds are in on it. That's the whole point. The ATF was trying to suppress Trump votes before the election by randomly deciding to ban pistol braces. This rot goes deep and it has to stop.
1326324986328588288 2020-11-11 08:44:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy This doesn't make sense because we actually conduct 51 separate elections. The SCOTUS could only invalidate an election 1 state at a time and that wouldn't prevent them from seating electors in any event.
1326323650845347840 2020-11-11 08:39:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law 1888 was stolen through bribery in Indiana.

1326321662804025346 2020-11-11 08:31:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou It's right here:  https://t.co/d0QSwCgcCC
1326321479961759744 2020-11-11 08:30:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jaskane @JayFiveK 2002 House map shows a gain, but this might have been a product of redistricting and not a true gain.
1326314473192304642 2020-11-11 08:03:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> You can tell when a district in California is overrun by illegals by how few votes there are in the district. These are usually in GOP dominated counties where they're stricter about voter rolls.
1326314057784242176 2020-11-11 08:01:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 @JayFiveK 213 votes. Based.
1326310181442105346 2020-11-11 07:46:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Seriously: No one here would feel that invested in this if they hadn't promised what comes next. They want total capitulation and they just don't have the strength to pull it off.
1326308890309505026 2020-11-11 07:40:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All I'm saying is maybe the Left shouldn't have forced Trumpists into a position where they've threatened to purge us from society for merely expressing our continued support for the President and his political goals.
1326308203894874112 2020-11-11 07:38:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @JayFiveK @JonesDay Everything is on the line. Either a legend or fired and career destroyed. Maybe the globalists shouldn't have forced Trump and literally everyone vaguely associated with him into this position. It's only strengthening our resolve.
1326307043695874048 2020-11-11 07:33:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @JayFiveK @JonesDay Oh, this guy is heading up. Basically was put there for this job:  https://t.co/WQO8VaengL
1326306481260597252 2020-11-11 07:31:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @JayFiveK @JonesDay Probably. Almost all of those law firms are filled with the most loathsome PMC lefties you can imagine. Part of the reason I didn't go to law school myself. Let me look and see where the Elections Law partners went to school and I can tell you a bit more.
1326305610137296897 2020-11-11 07:27:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @JayFiveK Apparently @JonesDay is representing the Trump Campaign. Sheisty lawyers every one. The best sheisters you can buy. (Well, not quite, but not sure if anyone higher up the food chain even has an elections practice).
1326300859832168449 2020-11-11 07:09:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Wait, I thought Republicans were terrible people because they didn't accept the results?
1326300629539708930 2020-11-11 07:08:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @indiegop @Robbo1992x Yeah, the whole Logan Act is an unconstitutional sham and the thing it is aiming to prevent is the only crime spelled out in the Constitution.
1326300313075261441 2020-11-11 07:06:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 @JayFiveK GOP needs to start its own ballot factory in Brazil somewhere.
1326299600660131846 2020-11-11 07:04:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Current status of the Democratic Caucus:  https://t.co/F5nPmyGZBw
1326299373924458497 2020-11-11 07:03:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Especially with the way the Democratic Caucus is on fire right now.
1326298917508706304 2020-11-11 07:01:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 @JayFiveK Still, first in a GE. That is the one the GOP is trailing in: Extremely close, though.
1326296668363436034 2020-11-11 06:52:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK They didn't win 9 seats in California. So far they've won back  three and are trailing in one they currently hold. Still, this is the first time Republicans have gained seat in California since like 2002 or something.
1326294398842384384 2020-11-11 06:43:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Emergency Fontes ballots hidden in the alleyway behind the Recorders' office.
1326293508064485381 2020-11-11 06:39:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Why does it take Arizona so long to count vote? It's not that hot there right now.
1326290477935697920 2020-11-11 06:27:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They literally sent a Trump advisor to jail for this.
1326289771241541632 2020-11-11 06:24:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL Yes, but lawyers are nothing if not snobs. These numbers mean something to them.
1326289124488327173 2020-11-11 06:22:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> DNC is usually represented by Perkins Coie, which is well down the Vault 100 list.
1326288694123356173 2020-11-11 06:20:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Wait, @JonesDay is representing the President? Haha. We got this. Hundreds of BigLaw T14 grads slaving away for the President right now.
1326287277824356357 2020-11-11 06:15:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> At this point, it seems clear that disgraced former VP Joe Biden ought to concede for the sake of unity. Pass it on.
1326286163443847169 2020-11-11 06:10:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dailywokeup @SelimSeesYou I mean, the Democrats suck for a reason. There are definitely worse Democrats out there, though. She's like Feinstein in that manner. Whole SFO machine is actually to the right of where you'd expect it given the political environment in that cesspit.
1326285154537648131 2020-11-11 06:06:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou For Kent, Delaware: It's a bellwether that only voted for Biden by 4 points when he was the Senator from Delaware for decades upon decades and it's home to the state capital. Even that tells you something is fishy.
1326284782318313473 2020-11-11 06:05:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ori_Ar @SelimSeesYou Couple point win for The Donald in 2016. Not much, you're right.
1326284691016724483 2020-11-11 06:04:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Oh, there's that one too. I was referring to Kent County, Michigan, though (Grand Rapids), though.
1326283723545915393 2020-11-11 06:00:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I think the only counties he really flipped were Pinellas, Duval, Erie, and Kent. Erie is because the Post Office is printing ballots there like it's their last chance.
1326282632615895044 2020-11-11 05:56:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingKirmudgeon @SelimSeesYou Honestly think that would probably be a mistake if Biden becomes President. That district is ripe for the picking in 2022 and being Speaker would basically secure that for Lamb. If Trump is President, though, I think control of the Chamber for business purposes is worth it.
1326280665130807296 2020-11-11 05:48:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingKirmudgeon @SelimSeesYou Lamb would never be agreed upon by the progressive wing. Too far right. He could be Speaker if Republicans agreed to support him, though.
1326280288012525576 2020-11-11 05:47:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CEOofBarron @SelimSeesYou There's definitely a fight in the Democrat House Caucus. There's no way some of these Democrats survive a 2022 midterm and they know it. I think the most likely result is they settle on a new median Democratic leader.
1326279901259968512 2020-11-11 05:45:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The Democrats are in quite a bind. Nancy is actually a pretty median Democrat all things considered. They either need to find another median Democrat to agree upon or the centrists will end up forming a coalition with the Republicans (which won't mean much if Biden is Prez).
1326278743090991108 2020-11-11 05:41:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 We love you, but keep your powder dry. Now is not the time to make needless enemies.
1326278176507572225 2020-11-11 05:38:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed That would probably be an effective way to accomplish a coalition Speaker since the Speaker doesn't vote by tradition.
1326277343158087680 2020-11-11 05:35:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Watch us get a coalition Speaker in the House.
1326276269693145088 2020-11-11 05:31:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FlycatcherSilky Given that Trump isn't backing down right now in the slightest, I think it's real. Only time will tell, though. We must keep the pressure on to make it real.

1326274638448652290 2020-11-11 05:24:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump is officially above my mean California projection of 5 million votes. Biden will likely exceed my mean of 10 million votes by a couple hundred thousand.
1326274233882861568 2020-11-11 05:23:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Joe Biden will never be President.

1326261334325997569 2020-11-11 04:31:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> TrueCon NeverTrumpers will argue it was their Constitutional Duty and we should accept it as a Fait Accompli.
1326257085269630979 2020-11-11 04:15:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark I always thought bringing Chris Christie on the team was a mistake.
1326255264786485248 2020-11-11 04:07:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Matt Walsh's food and clothing opinions are a caricature of stuffy sweater vest conservatism.
1326252105095663617 2020-11-11 03:55:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Given the sworn evidence, I'd take people more seriously if they said "the evidence is limited." They cannot do that, though, because that would acknowledge at least some evidence exists. They must baldly lie to you to gaslight you into submission.
1326246860663742465 2020-11-11 03:34:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Has Trump suspended the NFA yet?
1326244736672411658 2020-11-11 03:26:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Likely the only time this demographic was real was the 2008 election and, to a lesser extent, 2012.
1326242122782142464 2020-11-11 03:15:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I'm honestly extremely concerned if this ends up a double run off with a Trump Presidency incoming. That will energize Democrat turnout like crazy. Trump would need to fight HARD for both of those seats. Not sure it can be done.  Single run off would be more doable.
1326240024292171778 2020-11-11 03:07:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Tribune of the Plebs vetoes this election.
1326238474639462415 2020-11-11 03:01:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 There's always the fact Adrian Fontes is a crook too.
1326237541394165772 2020-11-11 02:57:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Can't report on Election Fraud, but can accuse the Trump Admin of systematically manipulating the Census.

1326236877658206209 2020-11-11 02:54:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 Their turnout as a percentage of population is extremely suspect.
1326236622367625216 2020-11-11 02:53:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou He's just using the Decision Desk map.
1326236322659446785 2020-11-11 02:52:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @Theo_Chilton He's literally the fulfillment of the Davidic Covenant and sits on David's Throne right now.....
1326236112399036417 2020-11-11 02:51:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 Trump's vote totals in the swing states match our behavioral analysis to a T. What I didn't fully expect was the higher totals in Blue States and, in some cases, turnout increase in red states as well.
1326235486462087168 2020-11-11 02:49:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon They've been at this game for potentially months in Pennsylvania. Preparing voter rolls to get all these fake votes in.
1326234846037946368 2020-11-11 02:46:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I myself thought a more realistic overall result would be 68 million for Trump with 70-71 for Biden. Trump eking out the EC win.
1326234463387398145 2020-11-11 02:45:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Quite frankly, I think they underestimated our turnout. That 71+ million numbers is rather high and a lot of it was people mobbing to the polls on Election Day. As a result, the fraud had to be so massive it became obvious to those watching.
1326230367670562821 2020-11-11 02:28:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Unstoppable force. Immovable object.
1326229309242138624 2020-11-11 02:24:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon He was elected a long time ago. Personal popularity goes a long way with some voters in House races.

1326227718363615232 2020-11-11 02:18:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon Peter DeFazio has notoriously hung on despite not matching his district very well. Eventually that seat will vote for Republican, just a matter of waiting for him to leave. Oregon 5 is a bit more of a fight.
1326226629291610112 2020-11-11 02:14:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon We did take Washington-3 under similar circumstances in 2010. OR-5 has a similar profile. OR-2 has a ridiculously personally popular incumbent.
1326225614542680066 2020-11-11 02:10:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Republicans need to redouble efforts at OR-2 and OR-5 in the midterms. Very close races. Would take control of the Oregon Delegation. Can be done!
1326224698103959553 2020-11-11 02:06:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trutsle @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 But only in Wayne County and only for Biden.

1326222854262845440 2020-11-11 01:59:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cav_is_boring I mention this because the lines on the floor of Parliament were part of the discussion: He asserted were superior to the English because of this.
1326221815136530433 2020-11-11 01:54:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cav_is_boring I once got into something of an argument with a Romney Campaign representative over this very issue at a Republican State Convention. He was angry I would even suggest booing Romney and wanted me kicked from the floor.
1326220663909179392 2020-11-11 01:50:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "America is too dignified for this!"  Maybe that's the problem?
1326220502894055429 2020-11-11 01:49:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Waiting for the brawls on the House and Senate floor to start.

1326219926760284162 2020-11-11 01:47:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These ballots tend to lean towards Democrats historically, but never by this much. Like, this is insane.

1326216313254055939 2020-11-11 01:33:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Timidity in the face of moral evil is in itself a great moral evil and often more galling than the moral evil itself.
1326212208737521667 2020-11-11 01:16:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's literally treason.
1326212077896265729 2020-11-11 01:16:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Fraudsmiths' Guild is still hard at work pumping out fake ballots. Gotta overwhelm the system.
1326210987347816448 2020-11-11 01:11:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FlycatcherSilky The midterms still energized a lot of Trump's base. There was huge GOP turnout and Democratic turnout was only marginally higher relatively. The real problem was some Indies swinging against the GOP.
1326210698830024706 2020-11-11 01:10:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat Caesar Chavez was extremely against migrant programs. I mean, any moron who wants higher wages would as well. Just basic common sense supply and demand.

1326208421486538754 2020-11-11 01:01:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BankerG2 I do agree they're not maxed out, though. They can probably get to a third, especially in low turnout years.
1326208337453707267 2020-11-11 01:01:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BankerG2 The problem is that the Black community has a lot more welfare class people. This isn't fertile ground for the GOP and can't be at all, even if GOP shifted messaging (they'd lose too much base). The remaining share of the non-college vote Democrats get is the welfare vote.

1326207215703908357 2020-11-11 00:56:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The real thing that would keep California from going red is the high density of PMC Whites and Asians. There just isn't a place for WWC people in California due to the insane taxation, regulation, and cost of living.
1326206731026903042 2020-11-11 00:54:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> PMCs have a huge advantage in midterms because they're such high propensity voters.
1326205807474708482 2020-11-11 00:51:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jacquoranda @NationalistTV They can try that, but I doubt the SCOTUS will find that acceptable.
1326205241193336832 2020-11-11 00:49:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jacquoranda @NationalistTV Then they don't get counted in the recount. If there's no evidence the ballot existed, it gets uncounted.
1326204940537180160 2020-11-11 00:47:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark When Joe Biden attempts his lawless usurpation in January (should it get that far), we will go for weeks and months at a time not knowing whether he is even alive.
1326204432665735172 2020-11-11 00:45:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner They've damaged their credibility so much. Even people who accept their diktats don't really believe them, they just submit to them out of some kind of loyalty.
1326203949054038018 2020-11-11 00:43:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is going to be huge, isn't it?
1326202705996615681 2020-11-11 00:38:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV This is because almost everyone is interested in top of the ticket. However, there are some voters who are conscientious about voting in races where they do not sufficiently know the candidates or issues. This is rarely *all* of them.
1326202533438689280 2020-11-11 00:38:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV The issue is the location of them. There usually is a drop off, but they're usually evenly distributed, and it's very rare to get a "just President" ballot, especially by mail where the voter had more time to vote. Usually they vote for Prez, and then random races down ballot.
1326201625543909377 2020-11-11 00:34:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks @Reactionary_Ed That probably was an unnecessary waste of imperial resources. However, displays of raw power are pretty Lindy.

1326200039396544513 2020-11-11 00:28:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL I've heard from multiple sources we must just submit to lawless usurpations, even when the lawful authorities resist, because it's in the Bible somewhere or something.   The fact of the matter is that the law was violated this election in the counting process. Unlawful state.
1326198615975530496 2020-11-11 00:22:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you think it is some kind of moral imperative to uphold "faith in democratic systems" you're wrong and you should a Bible sometime because it isn't anywhere in there.

1326196035606228993 2020-11-11 00:12:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's Trump's job to enforce the law. Your opinions on whether you trust the multitude of eyewitnesses coming out saying they witness electoral fraud are correct are irrelevant. Trump has the power of the sword until he chooses to concede it.
1326193534391754757 2020-11-11 00:02:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We all need to have patience right now. Trump isn't backing down and neither should you.

1326046121676976128 2020-11-10 14:16:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Why can’t the voter file identify these voters’ age? Many counties this number is a flat 0, but there here it’s more 1.5x Biden’s whole lead in the state.
1326045802117148674 2020-11-10 14:15:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> In the Wisconsin Early vote, an extremely high percentage of the national vote that the voter file can’t find an age for occurs in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. A full 13% of the number of unknown age voters (of those who didn’t vote in 2016) occur in this county.  https://t.co/3qintT6MsI

Trump kind of evened that out 4 years ago. Now there are all these mysterious Biden only ballots in extremely strategic locations we have no way of verifying where they came from.

1326037298203545601 2020-11-10 13:41:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @No2Sovereignty @Theo_Chilton The sheer size of the election day turnout in Pennsylvania for Trump was larger than even his own campaign expect by about 250K people. They expected 2.6 and they got close to 2.9.
1326036699626016768 2020-11-10 13:39:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheConnachtKing I'm not necessarily saying decline is inevitable either. I'm just saying things always take new forms. I don't believe in Fukuyama's concept that this is the end of history. Wars happen. Governments gain and lose power. These things just happen.
1326035956072321027 2020-11-10 13:36:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheConnachtKing As if this state of global affairs will continue ad infinitum into the second coming. As if the United States will always exist basically as it does today, for instance.

1326033867065749504 2020-11-10 13:28:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The amount of people who seem to think the Modern West is immune from the forces of history is, quite frankly, alarming.
1326033130327846913 2020-11-10 13:25:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton They're usually not "only President" ballots either. That's an extremely small fraction. The vast majority of voters vote top of the ticket, and then some choose not to vote in some down ballot races, but not others.
1326032408328679424 2020-11-10 13:22:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 There's never any dialogue with the modern left. It's a one way street.
1326032163461074944 2020-11-10 13:21:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 They don't even pretend to be interested in honest debate anymore. They just declare something debunked based on cursory evidence (at best) and then declare you a psycho for disagreeing. It's why I don't feel bad not dialoguing with these people.
1326029059973853184 2020-11-10 13:08:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> My view of the intelligence of the average Biden voter is very low, but I don't think they lack any sort of self respect.
1326028837491257344 2020-11-10 13:08:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Does anyone believe the Democrats actually elected a neocon administration voting in record numbers?

1326025345598803968 2020-11-10 12:54:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnonTrump66 @LanaLokteff I honestly think they did that to help the Pop and Wignats cope with the loss. They know those are the most fierce potential Trump supporters.
1326024873664196608 2020-11-10 12:52:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 @SelimSeesYou Dems stuff the box every year. They usually do it small enough amounts and in believable enough numbers you can't really prove much. 2016, they legit believed polls and were frantically scurrying to find votes. 2020 they were more prepared, but the Trump turnout was massive.
1326021341582139392 2020-11-10 12:38:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lauraka09619649 Yeah, I don't know. The margin in the county makes sense for the county's voting history. Trump actually got a very respectable vote share for the county.
1326019717258223616 2020-11-10 12:31:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 Gateway Pundit is alleging this happened and that it would come out during a recount.
1326019219037822976 2020-11-10 12:29:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 I mean, not if the MSM is in on the op.
1326019123009249282 2020-11-10 12:29:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Yeah, I mean these display glitches do happen pretty regularly. Trump did have a huge rally in this county two weeks before the election, though.
1326017315306082309 2020-11-10 12:22:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics It should be "persons to votes"
1326012487444164608 2020-11-10 12:03:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I'm skeptical too. If it does turnout out to the case, there were dozens of Miami-Dades throughout the country and it will be glorious.
1326011258953412609 2020-11-10 11:58:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Wisconsin "glitch" I'm pretty skeptical of. It was a Hillary+10 county. If it does turn out to be the case, we might be looking at something truly crazy here and not just a few stuffed boxes in Milwaukee County of whatever.
1326010755775393793 2020-11-10 11:56:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads This county voted for Hillary Clinton by 10 and hasn't voted red since '84. I'm skeptical, but if it's proven we could be looking at something truly unprecedented.
1326009552739987457 2020-11-10 11:51:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics I'm skeptical. It is possible this was a display glitch. This county is a pretty blue county.

1326000488978976770 2020-11-10 11:15:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou About the PA break: The PA GOP did consciously boycott mail-ins specifically. It isn't that crazy there'd be a bigger break there. The real scandal is the shear number of unreported mail ins.   Michigan: Yeah, the break is weird and should have been closer to Ohio. No boycott.

1325973040384122881 2020-11-10 09:26:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 The first night was the really early early vote.
1325972854232506369 2020-11-10 09:25:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton I mean, Chris Shays? Where'd they find that guy?
1325972725714841600 2020-11-10 09:25:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton There's not a single one of those who I have ever respect.
1325971285759959040 2020-11-10 09:19:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They're going to overcome the Fontes crook margin in Arizona.
1325971078020263943 2020-11-10 09:18:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer Flagstaff is a beautiful town, though.
1325971026119942145 2020-11-10 09:18:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer Coconino is a blue county dominated by PMC college types too.
1325970012281204736 2020-11-10 09:14:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @HeritageNLegacy It's one of those "We'd probably have been better off if we elected Gore" questions. We'll never really know. All we know is this is God's plan for how events should unfold.
1325968675623546880 2020-11-10 09:09:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wandlearner Yes.
1325966953815662598 2020-11-10 09:02:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’ve believed Democrats in California use illegal immigrant votes to stuff the box since I can remember having political thoughts.

1325960510601359360 2020-11-10 08:36:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DirkRecker7676 @CarlStein1984 @CottoGottfried @LuisBobby3 I don’t think so.
1325960381978857476 2020-11-10 08:36:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Frenchies just defraud their employers.
1325960077690482689 2020-11-10 08:34:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 @JayFiveK Getting conflicting reports about whether it was uncalled or not.
1325958992976355328 2020-11-10 08:30:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DaldorenGaming The Donald really has a way of persuading his enemies if you just listen to him. I experienced this personally the first time I heard him speak: Went from a skeptic to “I love this guy” in under 10 minutes.
1325958618596962304 2020-11-10 08:29:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Trump will be Caesar-Elect by next weekend.
1325953733365280768 2020-11-10 08:09:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 I have a feeling we will have to have this spirit for a while.
1325953240035446784 2020-11-10 08:07:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 Agreed.
1325953173341745155 2020-11-10 08:07:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Oh....
1325952781186904066 2020-11-10 08:05:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It’s ok to be loyal to a political leader as a Christian. No loyalty can be above Christ, but there’s nothing sinful about being loyal to a political leader either.
1325952220362313729 2020-11-10 08:03:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Yeah, I’m talking about the people who won’t let it go and think you’re a hate filled bigot or something. Just not representative of Christ at all.
1325949876786622465 2020-11-10 07:54:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Yeah, I really wouldn't want to be those guys on the day of judgment to be honest.
1325949595516612612 2020-11-10 07:53:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis I mean, part of the reason I'm an Anglican is I'm kind of a snob about liturgy and some other stuff (do not order a steak above medium rare in my presence). Making fun of randos on Twitter is a bridge too far for me.
1325949258059669504 2020-11-10 07:51:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pseudophilo @RupertVonRipp Modern Episcopalian priests are really sad creatures.
1325949112739631104 2020-11-10 07:51:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis The issue really affects conservative Anglican Churches as well. Anglicans just kind of *are* snobs. In the West anyway.
1325948038037327877 2020-11-10 07:47:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Almost worse. They make fun of you. Total elitist snobs. Don't even really engage.
1325947571207016450 2020-11-10 07:45:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I have more respect for Fr. James Martin than I do for many Anglican Communion Twitter priests and it makes me sad.
1325946945307877376 2020-11-10 07:42:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @revjackashcraft Even the 1876 election was mostly over some legal technicalities of the whole process.
1325946834259488768 2020-11-10 07:42:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @revjackashcraft Something big is going on here regardless of the final results, and I eagerly await them. We've never had an election contested on this magnitude.
1325946607494459394 2020-11-10 07:41:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @revjackashcraft You wouldn't tell ordinary congresscritters about something this big. You'd be dumb to even tell Mitch before it's a fait accompli. All I'm saying is have patience here. Trump doesn't seem to be backing down.
1325944948273844229 2020-11-10 07:34:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This guy wants to be a priest. Shameful.
1325944735899525121 2020-11-10 07:33:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @revjackashcraft Give it time. I didn't think this before the election, but Barr meeting with McConnell and then McConnell immediately going onto the floor and stating his support to continue the contest is good news regardless of why.
1325943481248964610 2020-11-10 07:28:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @M_Julius13 Then why are you making fun of fellow Christians in a foreign land for believing ours? That's unbecoming of someone who wants the ministry.
1325942677465149440 2020-11-10 07:25:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @M_Julius13 Also, there's evidence of several irregularities:  https://t.co/dT5TIkY6lP
1325942414272499716 2020-11-10 07:24:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @M_Julius13 He's your head of state and it's his job to enforce the law. And he intends to prove it in court.
1325941109407748096 2020-11-10 07:19:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @M_Julius13 Literally you and the media.
1325938244790464513 2020-11-10 07:08:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Important point.
1325936972729344007 2020-11-10 07:03:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL Baris is still insisting they used "curing" as an excuse to harvest in Georgia.
1325936622391746561 2020-11-10 07:01:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd I don't know what it is about Christians and media in this environment: These people have been openly slandering us for over a decade now and we just take their word because they're trusted or something? Give me a break.
1325936338433155072 2020-11-10 07:00:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL "I was assured by the Michigan Democratic Secretary of State that none of the OVER TEN THOUSAND dead people who attempted to vote actually did!"   It beggars credulity that this many dead people attempted to vote by accident. Obviously there was a large fraud scheme attempted.
1325934912793436161 2020-11-10 06:54:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> BBC: Exceedingly high turnout, but only in areas favorable to one party, is a sign of fraud.  Also Media: Oh, wait, that's only if it's third world. If it's in Pennsylvania, it's obviously legitimate.
1325934598279278598 2020-11-10 06:53:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy To be fair, she did basically just ask for patience. They're really all in on this narrative.
1325934460190269443 2020-11-10 06:53:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It is correct: I do not accept claims made by the Tokyo Roses of our information war.
1325932325402710016 2020-11-10 06:44:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep Crappy employers, maybe.
1325929015211921410 2020-11-10 06:31:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WesfromF The whole thing is a sham.
1325926762702843909 2020-11-10 06:22:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> FNC didn't call Indiana for hours even after it was obvious Trump would never lose that. He still lost Virginia by single digits after it was all set and done. Why didn't they call Indiana at the same time? No excuse.
1325926394967285760 2020-11-10 06:21:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> With Virginia, I think the reason for padding the vote for Biden here was less so that he would win the state, but more that they needed it to look inevitable very early on. Explains the irresponsible early call and everything proceeding from there.
1325916889135144960 2020-11-10 05:43:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot No: We will use this as a mandate to clean up our elections.
1325916630715670532 2020-11-10 05:42:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @coronayomama Hopefully we can get some cool groypers together for the after party.
1325914155933708288 2020-11-10 05:32:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MaritimeLoyal Facebook is the tool of the regime to force you to engage in socially acceptable action. Anons are where it's really at.
1325913411889356801 2020-11-10 05:29:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Look, I'm just going to believe Barr has been conducting the largest sting op in history until proven otherwise.
1325912889476124672 2020-11-10 05:27:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd @BronzeCullis It's a 19th Century Southern Protestant phenomenon.
1325912650975502336 2020-11-10 05:26:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 New guy is pro-Trump.
1325912512295022595 2020-11-10 05:25:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @JacobCLloyd The argument is that the Roman Church doesn't believe in the Gospel, so therefore their ordinances are invalid. It's rather Donatist.
1325912132484034560 2020-11-10 05:24:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @JacobCLloyd Yes.
1325911968570601472 2020-11-10 05:23:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump conducting countercoup ops and they're butthurt about it.
1325911046784241665 2020-11-10 05:20:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark The people who voted for Lolberts this time were not a very Trump friendly voting group. They were either BLM-sympathizing Left Lolberts or gun nuts so butthurt about the bump stock ban they don't remember what side their bread is buttered on.
1325909307515428865 2020-11-10 05:13:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BobRossPoolGuy @whois_John_Galt Sounds like it's time to rebuild it come hell or high water.

1325905148082843650 2020-11-10 04:56:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK All is water under the bridge as long as you rally to the banner on the day of decision.
1325903022904516608 2020-11-10 04:48:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK He needs to go to Federal prison.
1325901888810868737 2020-11-10 04:43:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical Yeah, the media used to be way worse with calls than they have been since 2000. Of course, now we're a banana republic, so we will see how this turns out.
1325901061962539008 2020-11-10 04:40:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical Watching the 80 results is fun because Carter just starts losing his own Southern base like immediately and even though they hadn't called the race, they weren't expecting that at all. Especially with California out, it was a done deal.
1325900812778954754 2020-11-10 04:39:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @paulasport20011 You're probably right, but we would need another few election cycles to fully confirm.
1325900718717497344 2020-11-10 04:39:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical Oh, yeah, I forgot about that one.
1325899658300952579 2020-11-10 04:34:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis "James White is a dick."  Catholics🤝KJV Respecters
1325898077899780098 2020-11-10 04:28:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @RedEaglePatriot The only way a critical mass of both sides will accept the outcome at this point is if we rerun the whole thing with the purple finger method in like Mid-December.
1325897701943369730 2020-11-10 04:27:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChaserWestbrook It has definitely been done. I honestly think Trump was right that the state was in play in August. It's a tough ask because these people are settled Dems at this point, but people have changed their minds before.
1325897314255450113 2020-11-10 04:25:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChaserWestbrook The key to a victory in New York State for a Republican is to win the Long Island+Staten Island vote overall (including Queens and Brooklyn) and then have the Upstate vote overwhelm Democrat margins in Manhattan and The Bronx.
1325896562275454977 2020-11-10 04:22:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChaserWestbrook (It's a joke).  In all seriousness, though, Trump didn't lose New York by that much all things considered.
1325896309686071299 2020-11-10 04:21:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @johnnysobieski There's a not insignificant number of Omaha bugmen paid by Warren Buffet himself.
1325895596465643520 2020-11-10 04:18:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnnysobieski NE-2 has been trending this way since Obama, to be fair.
1325895171708432384 2020-11-10 04:16:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Nebraska-2 is officially homosexual.
1325895081090576385 2020-11-10 04:16:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Florida is still close because, eh, it's Florida.
1325894924701741061 2020-11-10 04:15:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou It is. It's an excuse for systemic voter intimidation in Democratic machine counties. That's all it is.
1325894792694403072 2020-11-10 04:15:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Map after all fraud is exposed:  https://t.co/vhX5cKuboQ
1325893574668529664 2020-11-10 04:10:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If this was the early 20th Century, Trump would probably be having seances to contact the ghost of Richard Nixon.
1325891485489721344 2020-11-10 04:02:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BorealReinhard My understanding is they are, in fact, in touch with the Twitter autists.
1325891349888053250 2020-11-10 04:01:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep @oldtoryright. I haven't really been posting. Just a backup for when the coup goes full swing.
1325890460011950081 2020-11-10 03:58:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BorealReinhard Wisconsin we just have to prove the dirty votes in Milwaukee and Trump wins.
1325889415663718401 2020-11-10 03:54:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BorealReinhard Sounds like invalid mail in ballot sigs and the like.
1325888331687800832 2020-11-10 03:49:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @WesfromF @CottoGottfried It's a daunting task. It will be tiring.
1325887428729692161 2020-11-10 03:46:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WesfromF @LuisBobby3 @CottoGottfried That doesn't mean he's not optimistic about it. Sekulow is a religious guy. Using the word "miracle" is just in his vocabulary. It will take a miracle. That doesn't mean it is some bleak forlorn hope like Hitler sending out Ghost Divisions.
1325886699843547136 2020-11-10 03:43:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @CottoGottfried It's from the media. It's about the best you'll get out of them.
1325885083442704384 2020-11-10 03:36:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @coronayomama @thehangingchads  https://t.co/zpJtsOU1VF
1325884553563525120 2020-11-10 03:34:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads That's a good point: Elected officials should be more measured in their official, public response until we've officially decided it's go time.
1325883143317037064 2020-11-10 03:29:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @coronayomama @thehangingchads See other thread.
1325883084030550018 2020-11-10 03:28:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FieldFreeWill @thehangingchads Baris seems to have indicated a ton of CoA flags in Fulton County. There was definitely post-election ballot harvesting going on. TrueCons assure me this was somehow legal.
1325882904497557505 2020-11-10 03:28:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Rallies are about occupying physical space to show your continued support of the President.
1325882460568215552 2020-11-10 03:26:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads He seems to be indicating he doesn't think they will find enough invalid votes to overturn the margin.
1325882032174616577 2020-11-10 03:24:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I'm actually a bit concerned by this statement.
1325881312964730880 2020-11-10 03:21:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I looked at the donations map for SFO before the election: I was shocked how many there were for Trump. I randomly clicked on Harmeet Dhillon's too lol (she gave a metric shit ton of cash to everything Trump).
1325878041655074817 2020-11-10 03:08:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 Yeah, I'm not really shocked by this anymore. My body had time to prepare.
1325877109873631233 2020-11-10 03:05:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 DM me.
1325876923067719680 2020-11-10 03:04:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I'm convinced Chinese Intelligence was involved in the June riots.
1325874713189617665 2020-11-10 02:55:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim I actually believe this one and would support McEntee doing so.
1325873708326641664 2020-11-10 02:51:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> How many Joe Biden ballots in Las Vegas were the result of straight bribery and intimidation of working girls?
1325872932506234886 2020-11-10 02:48:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I think they technically suspended harvesting laws in Nevada. However, they still resorted to getting the dead and out of staters out to vote.
1325872297924812802 2020-11-10 02:46:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you would have told me in February they intended to systematically harvest invalid mail in ballots in 6 states to defraud the American Public of a legitimate election, I'd have thought you were nuts.
1325871958018433024 2020-11-10 02:44:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Over 2020 I have went from being extremely cautious about conspiracy theories, but obviously conscious of the elite agenda, to full blown "this is the biggest conspiracy we will ever witness unfold."
1325871593369837569 2020-11-10 02:43:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> More eyewitness testimony to the vast conspiracy. I guarantee this happened in Maricopa and Clark Counties as well.
1325869034903105536 2020-11-10 02:33:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> No one wants Kamala Harris in office either.
1325868993752739842 2020-11-10 02:32:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This should have been Sanders vs. Trump: An honest election between two competing worldviews. Instead we got slow-walked a coup starting in early February. It all seemed suspect starting in South Carolina. No one wants Joe Biden to be President for real.
1325868594908028937 2020-11-10 02:31:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I regret to inform you this whole election was a sham from day 1. Starting in the Iowa Caucus.
1325866940913643522 2020-11-10 02:24:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp OK. I'm dead.   This guy really thinks they'll be able to take the party back. Like, I don't care what Trump does from here, these people will never take control back of the Republican Party.
1325866629998186501 2020-11-10 02:23:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp This guy is a classic chickenhawk. He's extremely pro-war but he looks like he'd fall over if he tried to shoot a 12 gauge.
1325863666286276611 2020-11-10 02:11:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> My power levels are growing higher by the hour.
1325863535084265472 2020-11-10 02:11:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Yesterday I confronted a NeverTrump type Republican about basic trade policy and calling the WWC degenerate pill poppers and he spent the time fidgeting. Was rather funny.
1325858314547294209 2020-11-10 01:50:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Stop sharing fake news reports. Listening to media reports right now is like listening to Tokyo Rose. I’m sure the President is exploring all of his options, but if it isn’t public, it isn’t real.
1325857447798562818 2020-11-10 01:47:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Maybe because they weren’t part of a systematic fraud being conducted on the American Public.
1325854110999060480 2020-11-10 01:33:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperCrusade @realikamusume That’s not really how redistricting works.
1325854029596024834 2020-11-10 01:33:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Give it to Ohio.

1325849832704135168 2020-11-10 01:16:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MVernon_5 @SelbJim @Barnes_Law That's not what a provisional ballot is. A provisional ballot is a vote cast because they don't know if you've already voted or there is an error in your registration.
1325849815297773575 2020-11-10 01:16:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @atwaSDOK @SelbJim @Barnes_Law That's not what a provisional ballot is. A provisional ballot is a vote cast because they don't know if you've already voted or there is an error in your registration.
1325849424640286720 2020-11-10 01:15:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Hispanics in Philadelphia were disenfranchised by the dead vote.
1325849124261027840 2020-11-10 01:13:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer They're going to surrender.
1325847720926523395 2020-11-10 01:08:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ClassicalTheis I keep pointing this out: Our calculations on total votes were pretty much spot on in the key states for Trump based on the behavioral metrics, etc. Mysteriously Biden has more than we predicted, but only in the fraud states. Florida, Ohio, Texas? Spot on.
1325842371586772994 2020-11-10 00:47:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I would be weary of the  https://t.co/aP1z7evmhZ site, btw. Do not give away personal information to untrusted sites. Hat-tip @radiationorgan. Reminder to obey all lawful authorities and conduct your protests in a peaceful manner.
1325839476908847105 2020-11-10 00:35:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They can't steal Alaska because there aren't enough dead people in their cemeteries.
1325838693530279937 2020-11-10 00:32:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I was told they awarded their electors to Jo Jorgenson.
1325837577534967808 2020-11-10 00:28:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Joe Biden wins Pennsylvania 30 million to none!

1325833025729540096 2020-11-10 00:10:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnnysobieski It really makes you think how many people in PDX actually voted for Biden.
1325832109462786057 2020-11-10 00:06:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Presented without comment.
1325831738434707458 2020-11-10 00:04:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SouthernBytheG3 Let's let this play out. I firmly believe we should support Trump in whatever he decides to do to prevent this lawless usurpation.
1325830278640791554 2020-11-09 23:59:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SouthernBytheG3 I firmly disagree there is nothing he can do.
1325829332569378817 2020-11-09 23:55:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The United States isn't immune to the forces of history: Good or bad.
1325828934936748033 2020-11-09 23:53:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SouthernBytheG3 Trump is our lawful head of state. Attempts to resist his authority are, by definition, rebellion.
1325828731982786560 2020-11-09 23:52:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ProudColonizer As long as 5 do, it will only be to Roberts' shame if he does not. Still, we must pray all of them join the cause of justice.
1325828110017851395 2020-11-09 23:50:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I will remind you all that it is Joe Biden who is the "leader" of the lawless rebels in this story.
1325827879209488385 2020-11-09 23:49:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These sick bastards are already taking credit for the actions of the Trump Admin.
1325824339971862532 2020-11-09 23:35:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> More eyewitness testimony of a criminal enterprise to steal the Presidency, which must be stopped at all costs.
1325712999978586113 2020-11-09 16:13:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden He’s his son in law. He isn’t going anywhere. Annoying at times? Yes. But some people act like he’s President
1325711993618264064 2020-11-09 16:09:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Anton56422519 That is it. I’m more of a classical reactionary: Emotionally laden strongmen are kind of my jam.
1325709887624638464 2020-11-09 16:00:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd Yeah: The purge will be VIGOROUS. There might not be a second chance at this.
1325708409937797120 2020-11-09 15:54:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nguyenthevote @SelimSeesYou Ticket splitting isn’t necessarily fraud, but NE-2 saw an unusually high amount of ticket splitting. Vaguely possible? Yes. Likely? No.
1325707572847005698 2020-11-09 15:51:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I’m really suspicious of how many supposed NeverTrumpers are there that don’t seem to exist in any other Congressional District in the country.
1325706147899314179 2020-11-09 15:45:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> “I want Biden because he discredits the regime long term” is such an awful take. Like, no he won’t. Certainly not enough to cause some kind of critical mass to achieve real political objectives.
1325705808269733888 2020-11-09 15:44:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just don’t agree with these types of analyses. It always strikes me as people who think they know more than they do. People need to let events play out a bit before they go around overanalyzing them like there some kind of genius shadow government analyst.
1325704197208150017 2020-11-09 15:38:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Indubitably.
1325703791342202881 2020-11-09 15:36:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba This is bigger than Trump. You’re not looking at this from the proper perspective. This is an opportunity to expose our illegitimate institutions. His people do not seem to be backing down.
1325703313212444673 2020-11-09 15:34:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba This is absolutely not how the vast majority of his supporters feel.
1325700550084669440 2020-11-09 15:23:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Nomos_Forever @Charlemagne_03 This is the closest America has come to having a Caesar moment. You must push the narrative.
1325700130465599488 2020-11-09 15:21:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @2bittony @SelimSeesYou Yeah, there’s no reason they didn’t stuff the box with perfectly live voters they knew weren’t likely to vote. People go in and get told they voted already every election cycle. I doubt it’s an honest mistake that often.
1325699385104195584 2020-11-09 15:18:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Libs are so mind numb they associate Trump with establishment Republicans. They don’t even get that he’s a different breed. To them, he’s no different than Bush or Romney. They it’s all some parlor trick.
1325697776970248197 2020-11-09 15:12:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden If what they seem to be threatening comes to fruition, this might have been why he was hanging around the whole time.
1325697598838157312 2020-11-09 15:11:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Fact check: True.
1325697166128668676 2020-11-09 15:10:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Rudy broke the mafia. Watch him break the international cartels robbing us of our birthright.
1325695787356086274 2020-11-09 15:04:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou 10K dead in Michigan seems pretty big. “But the margin!” If there’s 10K dead voters, how much else is fraud?
1325692378951389184 2020-11-09 14:51:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @b0xmagic @VC4351 @DatElefan @Peoples_Pundit @shylockh "Debunked." Yeah, whatever.
1325688745539100673 2020-11-09 14:36:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "They were rejected!"  Why was it even attempted? Like, 1 or 2, maybe even a few dozen you're like "this guy clicked the wrong thing" or whatever, but several thousand? C'mon, do you think I'm a fool?
1325685174802259968 2020-11-09 14:22:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NickJFuentes You mean Trump's Second Inauguration. Because that's what's going to happen. If he wills it.
1325684114163380227 2020-11-09 14:18:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @1PathLessTravel @RealAPolitics Mail ins flowing in for weeks after the election flipped like 4 seats.
1325682714918391809 2020-11-09 14:12:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @1PathLessTravel @RealAPolitics Beginning to think 2018 was rigged as well. We know some in Cali were.
1325681831342186496 2020-11-09 14:09:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Seriously, Trump getting 160K out of 640K votes cast would have been an absolute disaster for Biden in Pennsylvania.
1325681455469621249 2020-11-09 14:07:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Was the NYTimes article about Biden struggling in Philadelphia (confirmed by @Peoples_Pundit) a signal for the Philly Machine to go into vote stuffing overdrive?
1325670989032775685 2020-11-09 13:26:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AdamasNemesis @17cShyteposter This is definitely true, but there's a trend here in a lot of these places. 3/4 of the McMuffin vote went to Trump in Utah.
1325667510323212288 2020-11-09 13:12:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden I think some PopNats have over read into the Trump phenomenon all their goals as well, but TrueCons definitely understand it even less. Just like they misunderstood the Tea Party. Or their base since like the Reagan Era at least.
1325665402865782784 2020-11-09 13:03:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden I've come to the opinion that TrueCons just don't even *want* to understand Trump, his base, or why we're so loyal. Just like the media, they assume we're just enthralled in some kind of bizarre personality cult.
1325663168002199558 2020-11-09 12:55:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The only two elections where I can find this kind of increase in vote for a defeated incumbent are 1840: Don't know what was going on with that crazy 80% turnout (up 22.4%). Thee other is 1888, which is widely known to have been stolen.
1325661868971728897 2020-11-09 12:49:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Statistically speaking, at least 2.25 million Trump supporters died since last election. Probably more like 2.5-2.75, maybe even 3 when you incorporate that the GOP skews old. That means Trump convinced at least 10 million more people to vote for him.
1325658838251528194 2020-11-09 12:37:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> TrueCons who were never into Trump anyway: "Aw, shucks guys, guess they stole the election, we'll get them next time."
1325657887297957888 2020-11-09 12:34:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @3502zippo If it's what we have to do, it's what we have to do. Caveat: The Armed Guards are delegated from each interested party.
1325653100032647168 2020-11-09 12:15:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These people really want me to believe honest turnout in Maricopa County was half the population.
1325652697824059392 2020-11-09 12:13:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat @Taliaferro_98 I can get behind this. I'm a Divine Right kind of guy, but the means of obtaining Jure Divino rule aren't always so clear cut as "this guy is the King's eldest son, he goes next."
1325652370328465408 2020-11-09 12:12:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DaldorenGaming @ProudColonizer I just hope he's willing to take down the ship with him if he needs to. We can't let these people get away with this. It's literally like letting your enemy have a warship. Every patriot's duty is to scuttle and scuttle fast.
1325651192609992704 2020-11-09 12:07:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I can't believe there are people who actually think the media convinced more than 10 million people that "Orange Man Bad, so must vote for creepy Pedo Joe" in the past 4 years.
1325647349184598017 2020-11-09 11:52:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BringBackPapa @RiddleguyMan @ScottMGreer I was with the person I mentioned when he did that and we were disgusted with those antics as well. Bygones are bygones, though.
1325646279641337859 2020-11-09 11:47:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ori_Ar @RiddleguyMan I mean, Dick Cheney is on the team
1325646182576689153 2020-11-09 11:47:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I need to emphasize: We really need to let things play out. If Trump hasn't conceded, we haven't either. Yes, this lull can be frustrating with all the fraud going on, but they want you to feel without hope and you can't let them win on that. This is how the terrorists win.
1325644984343801856 2020-11-09 11:42:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ori_Ar @RiddleguyMan It would be dumb. Quite frankly, it would be a blessing to our cause if Trump is to be ousted from office.
1325644850671345664 2020-11-09 11:42:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @ScottMGreer Cuccinelli is a good guy. I know someone who knew him way back when he was just a lawyer looking to get into politics.
1325643912648777731 2020-11-09 11:38:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @ScottMGreer Because Cuccinelli pulled that stunt on the floor of the Convention where he was trying to free the delegates of their binds to Trump. That was stupid, but it doesn't make him a supporter of "open borders."
1325643457692655618 2020-11-09 11:36:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LikeStojakovic Don't get your hopes up about "balls," but him saying he wants an investigation into the irregularities does help us in the infowar.
1325643305233813504 2020-11-09 11:36:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Yeah, he still sucks. Still, him coming out and saying he wants an investigation does give us legitimacy. This is less about him and more about winning the info war.
1325642918384832512 2020-11-09 11:34:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis I mean, we will see.
1325642321732513793 2020-11-09 11:32:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Is there some worse news I'm unaware of today? All I've heard is that Mitt Romney wants an investigation into the irregularities and Graham doesn't want Trump to concede.
1325641884161732610 2020-11-09 11:30:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis I keep hearing that everyday. What's the update. Trump is closer than last time. Not sure if the last vote dump he was on pace.
1325641634390937600 2020-11-09 11:29:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Apparently.
1325640212584816642 2020-11-09 11:23:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan The first time I heard Trump speak in person, I was honestly very skeptical and was prepared to be annoyed due to the venue (religious). Turned out it was the best convocation of my time at Liberty. Funny. Inspiring. Intelligent. He read the room perfectly.
1325639136351571971 2020-11-09 11:19:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> As long as Trump continues to assert his legitimacy, you should too.
1325638866230009856 2020-11-09 11:18:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is information warfare. The media has spent four years lying constantly (as opposed to the usual low level twists) to you on behalf of global elites hellbent on your dispossession. Biden/Harris have already announced their intentions. You must resist this usurpation.
1325638223582867459 2020-11-09 11:15:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 This sums it up.   https://t.co/MjIP6UbfwY
1325636130851721217 2020-11-09 11:07:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 Like, I don't get how you can't just acknowledge it's suspicious how this played out. Normies are suspicious of it. You're thinking like a lawyer, not a normie.
1325635202039865345 2020-11-09 11:03:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 Philly had 640K votes as of 6:30 PM on Tuesday night. They claim to have 800K right now. Where did these extra votes  come from? Why did these late night vote surges happen only in known corrupt and leftist counties? Quit being naive or you're going on mute.
1325633882008522752 2020-11-09 10:58:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 Have you not seen the reports of Republican polling station watchers denied entrance to polling stations and vote counting centers? Are you just willfully blind? Are you this naive? Do you think this hasn't happened before?
1325633630098649088 2020-11-09 10:57:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Everywhere that ran an honest election with competent observers, chains of ballot custody, hard counts of votes to tally, etc. saw Trump maintain or increase his vote share, basically. Mysteriously several states with shady practices this didn't happen and we want forensic proof?
1325632733448728577 2020-11-09 10:54:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 Do you believe we need proper account and chain of custody for ballots and for this to be observed by lawful observers from all candidates' campaigns?
1325631452659200001 2020-11-09 10:49:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 ...That's more than enough evidence for what you'd call "reasonable cause." If you deny that, it's just sophistry and naivety about the way American Elections work.
1325631306571665409 2020-11-09 10:48:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 Look, I'm just a guy on Twitter. If you don't think mysterious 4 AM vote dumps of previously unaccounted for votes in places that refuse to allow a sufficient number of observers and provide chain of custody isn't suspect, I have a bridge to sell....
1325630704001150976 2020-11-09 10:46:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @OVonReuenthal She's an idiot.
1325628168309530625 2020-11-09 10:35:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I mean, we all knew that.
1325627515751292929 2020-11-09 10:33:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 Sir, this is Twitter.
1325627009767272449 2020-11-09 10:31:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Exactly.
1325626649409359872 2020-11-09 10:29:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I’m honestly of the opinion most of this Covid thing was a conspiracy. Was it hatched in some lab for the purpose? Probably not. But it all seems awful convenient how it all played out for them. The main flaw is it gave a lot of time for people to notice things.
1325619167635124225 2020-11-09 10:00:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Well, this *is* the next best thing.
1325616525160624129 2020-11-09 09:49:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Occupy physical space for the President! Thank you @JacobCLloyd
1325615784618496000 2020-11-09 09:46:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> YESSSS!!!!
1325597256632967169 2020-11-09 08:33:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> IT IS ON!
1325595660326989826 2020-11-09 08:26:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy Except in the fraud states.
1325595488834494465 2020-11-09 08:26:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Is this what this whole thing was about? To discredit our concerns?
1325586453913628672 2020-11-09 07:50:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK There are no brakes on the Trump Train. We know this. It is a law of the universe like gravitation.
1325584577361010689 2020-11-09 07:42:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> FRAUD
1325572620570537984 2020-11-09 06:55:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @CrankyFed I also think the Coronation Oath serves as an analog.
1325564585886310403 2020-11-09 06:23:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's important that we remember patience is a virtue during this trying time. We may want the smoking gun right before the public for all to see right now, but that may take time.
1325561103573770241 2020-11-09 06:09:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The issue is that there are always some of these. It's going to be difficult to obtain how many, though. The extreme of "just Biden" voters is definitely weird. A lot of people skip lower ballot races because they don't know, but all of them?
1325557680249966592 2020-11-09 05:55:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan The thing we need to get into the softer right's mind (and even center) is that this can't happen again. Several states had model elections this cycle. Covid is just a BS excuse for a few states.
1325556685000372225 2020-11-09 05:51:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan The thing there's no real excuse for is having the wide berth for potential votes being out. They should have a more solid handle on it than a 14% margin.
1325556353688104960 2020-11-09 05:50:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @yemanouspeak I think there's enough mounting evidence that this software was at least deeply flawed to require a manual counting of the votes in many states. It need not even necessarily be malicious (though, we both know it would), just flawed programming.
1325555913713922049 2020-11-09 05:48:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Decision Desk says between 12.1 and 26.8% of the vote is out (seriously?).
1325555563380486145 2020-11-09 05:47:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan I'd hold off on that. They're still reporting 28% of the vote out. Trump has made huge absolute vote gains even in deep blue areas. The Bronx has more than 50% more votes for Trump.
1325554884180140032 2020-11-09 05:44:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Of the 5 he didn't, one is Delaware (big surprise), Maine has experienced a big demographic shift (PMCs), Kentucky is basically maxed our for the GOP. Connecticut and Rhode Island are the ones that make this hypothesis weaker, but it's an incredibly small margin regress.
1325548192323301377 2020-11-09 05:18:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Charlemagne_03 I'm there.
1325548127861006336 2020-11-09 05:17:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Charlemagne_03 The MAGA Rally next Saturday?
1325545707319668737 2020-11-09 05:08:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @lynnrusso88 The theory is that it's a feature, not a bug.
1325544825219936258 2020-11-09 05:04:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @Roark1Jacob @KevinAldrich2 The theory is also that DeSantis was a victim of this too. As were many midterm Republicans, supposedly.
1325544544117673985 2020-11-09 05:03:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob @bestgtor88 @KevinAldrich2 To further explain the motive for this: It's to make it look like Trump is less popular with his own base (despite turning them out in absolutely bonkers numbers).
1325544261614497797 2020-11-09 05:02:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Yeah, definitely need to focus on the key states before going full "audit everyone everywhere" mode.
1325543626110332929 2020-11-09 05:00:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @Roark1Jacob @KevinAldrich2 It just seems extremely coincidental Trump gained like 1-2 points vote share in a lot of random deep blue counties (or didn't recede as expected *by his own campaign* in Hillsborough), but for some reason the red areas are about 1-2 points less red.
1325542892002283520 2020-11-09 04:57:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @Roark1Jacob @KevinAldrich2 The hypothesis is that they used it in red and light blue counties, but not deep blue counties in a lot of these places. Explains why Trump has a huge margin gain in Southeast Florida, but a small margin loss in the red areas.
1325540191403208711 2020-11-09 04:46:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @KevinAldrich2 @Roark1Jacob It's still worth investigating if this thing is true.
1325538597915815937 2020-11-09 04:40:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tubafoh @JayFiveK Get on the team.
1325538436602793984 2020-11-09 04:39:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @KevinAldrich2 @Roark1Jacob Vote share is important when it is at or near majority. Winning a state by 10 points when your share is 40 is not as impressive as winning it by 10 with 54% share.
1325537837769510913 2020-11-09 04:37:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @unstoppaghosted @onewalleee Whatever happens from here, we must be absolutely dedicated to getting free, fair, open, and honest election procedures and vigorously enforce them in every state of the Union. This should be universally agreed upon.
1325537393609412615 2020-11-09 04:35:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roland_Gunn2 I should clarify: He likes Trump now and regrets not trusting him to deliver in the first place.
1325537186620592130 2020-11-09 04:34:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roland_Gunn2 My Uncle who hated Trump and voted for Ted Cruz after he dropped out of the race is convinced Trump had Washington stolen from him this year. He lives in a swing county.
1325536617851998210 2020-11-09 04:32:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roland_Gunn2 I'm deep behind enemy lines here, but that also leads me to know things. I'll leave it at that.
1325536025201045512 2020-11-09 04:29:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roland_Gunn2 I'm just praying something comes of this at some point. People are going to think we're crazy. Maybe we are, I don't know. I know I don't trust these people.
1325535725010509826 2020-11-09 04:28:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @Roark1Jacob He got .03% less share with at least 1.2 million more votes. Like, that's insane.
1325535505845522433 2020-11-09 04:27:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 10 million were just so offended by Trump they swamped to the polls. But only in swing states with extremely sketchy ballot handling skills.
1325535097026727938 2020-11-09 04:26:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @crow_tommy_ @HeritageNLegacy Protestantism and Nationalism are two peas in a pod.
1325534931959820289 2020-11-09 04:25:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob I think they just couldn't come up with the needed numbers there. They were just flat overwhelmed by Trump votes.
1325534326017101828 2020-11-09 04:23:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @JayFiveK "I may be an evil racist, but at least I'm not a conspiracy theorist!"
1325534071506792449 2020-11-09 04:22:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy More Evangelicals voted for Trump on Tuesday than have for anyone in history. By the millions.
1325533203294253058 2020-11-09 04:18:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK All the right-wing "we need more proof!" takes seem to be from college educated PMC types, tbh. Even in the dissident sphere, there's a temptation to rag on normie right narratives to appear smart to the left. It's a pitfall.
1325532503872958464 2020-11-09 04:15:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TalleyrandCovfe @ScottMGreer Good point about that.
1325532421715070977 2020-11-09 04:15:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp It's looking that way. Let's focus on the key victory states first and then we can do a full audit to figure out what really happened.
1325531835527467036 2020-11-09 04:13:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If this Dominion software "glitch" strategically in red to light blue counties, particularly red and light blue suburbs, turns out to be a real thing, the Democrats were likely thinking Texas was in play from it. They didn't foresee the mass increase in Hispanic support.
1325529167572643841 2020-11-09 04:02:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Melania stands by her husband as all wives should.

1325527665529524225 2020-11-09 03:56:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles @SilentVoter4 Ignore lib troll posts. Block lib troll accounts.  Half these people are fake anyway.
1325526118758232066 2020-11-09 03:50:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles I have lived in Washington and my Uncle thinks it was stolen too.
1325525367566823424 2020-11-09 03:47:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @travis_john78 We apparently oppress people because we ask them not to drink alcohol and have pre-marital sex of their free accord as adults going to the school. We also are well known to hate gay people, apparently.
1325524245045260292 2020-11-09 03:43:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @travis_john78 I know fellow alumni who are embarrassed to admit they went there. They won't even talk to me about their experiences at the school like a normal human being. It's really weird. I don't let HR ladies looking down on it phase me.
1325522213357936641 2020-11-09 03:34:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @travis_john78 Yeah, he has been good. I’m not a huge college football fan, but it’s always nice to cheer on the Alma Mater.
1325521620019142661 2020-11-09 03:32:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I genuinely didn’t believe this day would come for many years. Its our third year in the FBS.
1325521383930081280 2020-11-09 03:31:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> What, what, my team is ranked?
1325520319818461191 2020-11-09 03:27:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis We’re relying on a lot of people past their prime right now. Trump isn’t exactly a spring chicken himself.
1325519101045985280 2020-11-09 03:22:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I recognize I have been loose with language using the word “meme.” As in “meming” someone onto the team, etc. What we really ought to be doing is *praying* they join the cause of justice. I apologize for this looseness of words.
1325517949306855425 2020-11-09 03:18:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis We’re talking about the guy who broke the power of the mafia and made New York a peaceful, happy city for the first time in decades. The optics might not be great, but that lion is in there somewhere.
1325517272669163524 2020-11-09 03:15:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @MeldEndCastles We’re going for gold. National recount and audit of the vote in every state of the Union. Right now we must focus on the key states to keep our eyes on the ball, but once we have achieved victory on that front, we shall discover the true depths of their national disgrace.
1325516758539759618 2020-11-09 03:13:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 🤣
1325516705930620930 2020-11-09 03:13:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Wow. Lol.
1325516438858293248 2020-11-09 03:12:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GoogleAgorism In Wisconsin, clerks in Dane and Milwaukee are known to have “fixed” faulty absentee ballots. Georgia and Michigan are plagued by counting machine problems that no one really knows the full extent of.

1325512053658882049 2020-11-09 02:54:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 @NoctRomaRTW @JayFiveK No doubt he’s a rough and tumble guy. Perhaps too much so. We all have our flaws. I find people who doubt his conversion because of rumormongering gossip columns grossly pharisaical. We’re not supposed to listen to talebearers.
1325511220691152896 2020-11-09 02:51:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Truth_Reaction @JaromeBellVA Have patience. It’s a virtue.
1325510734994927617 2020-11-09 02:49:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tpjohn5454 @JayFiveK @SwampFox8 I have little doubt Fontes printed tens of thousands of Biden/Kelly ballots.
1325510491343638538 2020-11-09 02:48:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Giuliani is claiming potentially up to 900K invalid votes were cast in Pennsylvania. Impossible, you say? Think again. The bigger the lie the easier to get away with because the more crazy the man calling it out looks.
1325509500686786562 2020-11-09 02:44:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @SwampFox8 @NoctRomaRTW Reminder that one Mr. Roger Stone was also involved on Bush’s team in the Florida 2000 events.
1325509286185889793 2020-11-09 02:43:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @JayFiveK @SwampFox8 I honestly believe God is guiding him through this. A lot of people think that’s crazy, but it’s what the Bible says God does for true kings. It is assuredly possible Trump has genuinely converted too. He asserts so and he has born fruit in his policies.
1325508710953852928 2020-11-09 02:41:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @eugyppius1 @JayFiveK Yeah, the other counties it was just a few ballots here and there to give the appearance of a trend.
1325508046257262592 2020-11-09 02:38:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 @JayFiveK This was a long time Democratic seat and she was never elected. Also, for redistricting, the Democrats actually don’t control it. It’s controlled by a pan-partisan (including Indies) board. California actually has pretty fair districts.
1325507454554296321 2020-11-09 02:36:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m seeing a lot of people use this as counter evidence for the rigging. These people do not understand how Democrat machine politics work on a lower level and on a higher level they do not understand the GOP may have been in on the steal.
1325505014002044935 2020-11-09 02:26:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LikeStojakovic @ScottMGreer Yeah, India doesn’t really matter for our political narrative.
1325504800553902083 2020-11-09 02:25:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @eugyppius1 @JayFiveK I’m convinced they printed mail in votes in every county.
1325504403932123139 2020-11-09 02:24:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you don’t believe this is a sham, I once again would like to sell you a bridge or a timeshare.
1325504155285409792 2020-11-09 02:23:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer I think Modi is just naive.
1325503699553312770 2020-11-09 02:21:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> PMC Republicans mostly just don’t *get* the Trump supporter worldview. We’ve long suspected there’s a great deal of evil in our government. Trump didn’t tell us this. He just has shown a lot of light on it. Meanwhile they autistically demand absolute forensic proof.
1325502630697775106 2020-11-09 02:17:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Dadetalian Florida was the first state to flip GOP in the South. I think there will stay Southern GOP states: AL, MS, LA, AR, TN, and KY aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. I doubt SC is either: It just has more Blacks so it looks closer.
1325501743275397124 2020-11-09 02:13:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Dadetalian Perhaps so. Definitely can see scenarios even in 2024 they get put in play. That would have to be very favorable circumstances. 2028 they’ll look even better.
1325501202835103744 2020-11-09 02:11:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Dadetalian Both New York and Illinois have shown signs they’ll be back in play for Republicans long term this election.
1325500353362714624 2020-11-09 02:08:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I honestly think Trump was right that New York was in play in August. The margin of 12 there right now wreaks of some Dems coming home in the final stretch.
1325500068133277696 2020-11-09 02:06:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Dadetalian @joehiden16 But he gains some WWC Dems who just wouldn’t ever vote GOP.
1325499813887152128 2020-11-09 02:05:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Dadetalian @joehiden16 Lies: Trump wins 45 states.
1325498480035573783 2020-11-09 02:00:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MVarcolac @Jroxer99 Wouldn’t surprise me.
1325498419792777216 2020-11-09 02:00:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 That’s what I’m saying: They’re surrendering to Trump.
1325498220697571330 2020-11-09 01:59:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim These people have no clue how Trump Supporters view the world.
1325491443931246593 2020-11-09 01:32:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Reminders: Block lib trolls. Ignore lib troll posts.  Adrian Fontes is a crook.  Trump won in a landslide and they manufactured the votes in the dead of night.
1325491165127450633 2020-11-09 01:31:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They’re surrendering.
1325434447513198594 2020-11-08 21:46:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> True!
1325358770411753472 2020-11-08 16:45:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Hillary also knows that part of her margin is stuffing in these states too. Recounts don’t go smoothly in that situation.
1325352646925049859 2020-11-08 16:21:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DazzyJinzo They definitely steal memes, though.
1325350825959559168 2020-11-08 16:13:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They steal our memes like they steal our votes.
1325345367882391553 2020-11-08 15:52:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bguddy611 @realikamusume @LarrySchweikart You need someone who can tie in the Collar Counties and have the rest of the state beat the Chicago Cemeteries.
1325344070584180737 2020-11-08 15:47:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago I’d say they’re synonymous for most people. I do understand in libertarian thinking they can be distinguished and there is something to that.
1325343027695640577 2020-11-08 15:42:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Does this guy not understand what government is? Government is force. It’s not just some old ladies at post office.
1325342617866035201 2020-11-08 15:41:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReformedMallard Does this guy understand what government and the use of force even are? Like, we seem to be confused on this point these days.
1325341674982268930 2020-11-08 15:37:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GRANTSRNTS I’d bet Adrian Fontes was doing this in Maricopa County too.
1325340143063080962 2020-11-08 15:31:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> “We got to elect Joe Biden because Trump says mean things about reporters we all hate anyway.”
1325339530786992130 2020-11-08 15:29:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Virginia might be blue, but it’s light blue.
1325338783181631493 2020-11-08 15:26:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Here’s the motive to stuff the box in Virginia: Networks get to call it instantly when polls close. You’re not supposed to do that unless you know for sure the guy is going to win. Not that they care about this year, but a 10 point margin basically vindicates the instant call.
1325337757028323328 2020-11-08 15:21:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @17cShyteposter Seriously. Just don’t surprise us with 90% dead people turnout and we’ll believe you.
1325336924140265472 2020-11-08 15:18:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @17cShyteposter The weird thing is that Michigan and Ohio ran basically the same election, just without any integrity laws or enforcement in Michigan. Like, these numbers should be closer. Even if Biden legit won the state.
1325336143731318784 2020-11-08 15:15:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Ok, but I already lost mine in a horrible boating accident last year.
1325335422143229953 2020-11-08 15:12:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThracianGroyper In NY, for a Republican to win, they basically have to fight to a draw between Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island, and then hope the rest of the state overwhelms the Dem margins in The Bronx and Manhattan.
1325335163119816704 2020-11-08 15:11:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThracianGroyper The demographics are such that if you get the right turnout demographic, NoVA isn’t so blue that it can’t be overwhelmed by downstate turnouts. Most of the population is downstate. Downstate just isn’t as red as Northern Virginia is blue. It’s not as bad as NY, for instance.
1325332476584226817 2020-11-08 15:01:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @DickChappy88 I’m just saying Democrats were generally the party of free trade post-Jackson.
1325330997337075713 2020-11-08 14:55:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Wait, what, there's a GOP chief in Israel? Like, how does that work?
1325330701760204800 2020-11-08 14:53:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @DickChappy88 That was a key Democrat plank back in the day. Ironic given the "Tariff of Abominations" Jackson passed.
1325329962371526656 2020-11-08 14:51:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp We NEED integrity in our elections. It's of the absolute utmost importance. This is like verifying your heir to the throne isn't a result of your Queen's adulterous affair. Just basic common sense.
1325327816683106304 2020-11-08 14:42:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Like, I'm not into lib "Diebold stole Ohio" tier yet, the fraud seems more old school than that mostly, but it would freaking hilarious. They both stuff the box and surreptitiously steal Trump votes to make you look crazy. Brilliant. If not for one flaw....
1325327446070136832 2020-11-08 14:41:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Watch this scorecard thing be real and instantly flip millions of votes to Trump.
1325327208886530051 2020-11-08 14:40:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @vaniteye @SelimSeesYou It's a joke. They usually wait for the first vote dump from Alaska for appearances' sake, but I think only time it has ever voted Democrat was 1964 lol. They've been trying to meme it into some kind of swing state since 2008, though.
1325324968255746049 2020-11-08 14:31:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Give your energy to Trump. This is the key stage of attempted demoralization, and, honestly, it's having the opposite effect on me. I was having difficulty sleeping from nervous energy on Wednesday. Tonight? I'm just too damn excited.
1325322894046597122 2020-11-08 14:22:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump is going to get 71 million votes or more. And never once, not one time did his approval rating exceed 50%? I mean, c'mon people.
1325322528135409664 2020-11-08 14:21:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GRANTSRNTS I told someone earlier today a Biden vote is by definition invalid as it proves the voter was too stupid to vote.
1325321388866072576 2020-11-08 14:16:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you don't believe the media spent four years manufacturing fake approval Biden horse race numbers, I have a bridge I'd like to sell.
1325320558851010560 2020-11-08 14:13:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FoundingRequite @GRANTSRNTS Absolutely, I agree.
1325320330949365760 2020-11-08 14:12:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Recall: The color revolution is FOR TRUMP. They stuffed the box, not us.
1325320218701393921 2020-11-08 14:12:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Why is it ok to color revolution the Ukraine, but not ourselves? Are we some kind of sacrosanct nation above the moral law?
1325319610699313152 2020-11-08 14:09:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GRANTSRNTS @FoundingRequite I agree, but he has a point. Our anger is directed at legitimate injustice, not random idiots who happened to vote for Biden. If they choose further evil in the coming days, they've made their own bed, but we're not personal enemies.
1325318773654622208 2020-11-08 14:06:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 As much as I know about this stuff, there's just so many arcane laws in so many states and this election has thrown even those for a loop, so it's impossible to really know the full details in a lot of these cases.
1325317857710923777 2020-11-08 14:02:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 Oh, I don't know for sure. That would freaking awesome though. Total glorious victory.
1325315016518754304 2020-11-08 13:51:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 It is possible some of them had votes mailed in for them and the provisional ballot could expose some of the fraud. That's pretty ballsy, though, on the part of Dems. Think they'd limit it to known non-voters in the red counties.
1325314675710566400 2020-11-08 13:50:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago There's also the fact I know Fairfax County was below 2016 turnout as of 5 PM Election Day and now it's like 75K votes over (all for Biden!) despite no reports of lines at any polling stations and no late absentees allowed.
1325314255260938245 2020-11-08 13:48:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago I don't know. What I do know is there are 85K Biden over votes in the First Congressional District. They voted for Biden and Mark Warner, but they didn't vote on anything else. Including the amendments in our state, one of which is pretty important this year.
1325313702573338624 2020-11-08 13:46:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @17cShyteposter This is the case in basically every honest state. He flipped Lorain County, Ohio on Johnson votes, basically.
1325313426814537729 2020-11-08 13:45:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm at the point where I think Virginia was stolen. Probably should have been recount territory. Yeah, you can think I'm crazy all you want, I don't care.
1325313297030197248 2020-11-08 13:44:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheEorlkonig @davidchapman141 Honestly, we could have gotten more Hispanics on our side if we want full race-baiting against Blacks. That risks driving out *legitimate* Black turnout, though (as opposed to the fraudulent Black turnout).
1325312733219348480 2020-11-08 13:42:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @DickChappy88 I don't know, the fact several factories demanded their workers return Republican ballots seems pretty sketch. Our elections in that era were notoriously corrupt too.
1325312245002366976 2020-11-08 13:40:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheEorlkonig @davidchapman141 I think he could have sold the Platinum Plan differently. Sure, emphasize the Black outreach, but make sure it's known everyone is eligible (as the law would dictate).
1325312002013720576 2020-11-08 13:39:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Protestant dissenters to the legitimacy of the so-called "Biden Administration" will officially be called "Non-Jurors." We will not fully contemplate the meaning of this until the fight is over.
1325311006378168326 2020-11-08 13:35:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheEorlkonig @davidchapman141 They did do that, though. Do you look at the vote totals? There's only so much we can do as human beings. Trump got 205K more people to the polls in Wisconsin. That's 3.5% of the state's POPULATION. That's a lot of people who didn't vote for him last time, and they're mostly WWC.
1325310512687697920 2020-11-08 13:33:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Watch Baris be right about 10K votes. I want it for him so bad. He's doing great work over there.
1325309721792946182 2020-11-08 13:30:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BustoAlligator @RupertVonRipp @tonybalogna Doesn't matter. State Legislatures have sole authority. Some dispute about repealing the statutes, but if they determine there was significant fraud, it will cause a constitutional crisis.
1325309377524494338 2020-11-08 13:29:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @tonybalogna Time will tell. Reports are they actually approached the Trump Campaign about the nuclear option back in September. The Left has been worried about the nuclear option since that time. Probably a mole in the GOP camp.
1325309102835240961 2020-11-08 13:28:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tonybalogna Constitutional crises cause crisis solutions. Just saying.
1325308720201560066 2020-11-08 13:26:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Newsmax and One America are doing the Lord's work. They're our news providers now.
1325308133141581824 2020-11-08 13:24:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Given all the street celebrations, you'd think it was already under control. Who knew?
1325307834339368960 2020-11-08 13:23:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 Full story? Usually you're supposed to cast them if you've already been sent a mail in ballot. Sometimes you cast them if they think you've already voted. Could expose fraud if we're lucky (people voting for someone else).
1325307084183900160 2020-11-08 13:20:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you want to experience consumerism in its purest, most unadulterated form, I encourage a visit to the United Arab Emirates. It's so honest about it that it's endearing.
1325306574332719105 2020-11-08 13:18:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Good point. He should move to Dubai. They're building a synagogue last I heard.
1325305574674870272 2020-11-08 13:14:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp The stakes were just raised. We will see how the Gulf Arabs respond.
1325305308282048512 2020-11-08 13:13:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy I really thought he'd stay quiet. Of course, Bibi has gotten what he needs out of Trump. We will see how much this affects the calculus.
1325304867167068160 2020-11-08 13:11:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It is very important we obey the lawful authorities and exercise our rights to peacefully protest.
1325304646802534405 2020-11-08 13:10:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Bibi has turned on the President. He shall remember this.
1325304228206813185 2020-11-08 13:08:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly Do not stop meming until Trump concedes. The meme energy must be printed out faster than Post Office print new Biden ballots.
1325303987424391169 2020-11-08 13:07:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep I believe they are throttling all of us.
1325303848391614464 2020-11-08 13:07:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Zukk66127667 @RyanGirdusky Look at the numbers. Trump is going to get at least 8 million more votes. He didn't lose any White vote. Where is that evidence in Ohio? Indiana? Tennessee? Maybe some in Texas because of the PMCs, not the WWC.
1325303482212098049 2020-11-08 13:05:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @JayFiveK Of course, without that, they don't get their mass absentee fraud scheme.
1325303321087926273 2020-11-08 13:05:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @JayFiveK This part, yes. The virus thing maybe wasn't part of the plan. It allowed us to understand something was up. The narrative of 2020 is one of chaos. Of course the election is chaos.
1325302872595165184 2020-11-08 13:03:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf @JayFiveK Large scale electoral reform must be part of the agenda. Voting Rights Act, but this time actually protecting the vote instead of helping Dems intimidate voters.
1325302435804557312 2020-11-08 13:01:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK We all knew where this year would end up by the time March rolled around. Our bodies have been preparing all year.
1325302057092460544 2020-11-08 13:00:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @SirDowden Philly is going to end up with like 100K more than 650K, btw.
1325301838170746881 2020-11-08 12:59:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @SirDowden As of 6:30 PM on the night of the election, there were 650K votes in Philadelphia, including approximately 350K mail ins. Where did all the extras come from? Turnout is flat or down in urbans in the open states. Philly, Wayne, and Milwaukee supposedly had last minute vote surges.
1325301112312909824 2020-11-08 12:56:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @SirDowden It's entirely normal to take a few days to count straggling ballots. The sketchy states have masses of votes no one knew about until 4 AM the night of the election. You cannot accept the legitimacy of this election from this fact alone. These votes are entirely against Trump.
1325300765515190272 2020-11-08 12:55:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DickChappy88 Voter intimidation.

1325298358492278786 2020-11-08 12:45:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "Climate Change" is just an excuse to sell our jobs to China.

1325297292384014336 2020-11-08 12:41:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @SouthernConsDem A lot of people are thinking Abbott for President. I'm not even sure he really wants it. He seems really happy where he's at. President's a tough job.
1325296609857572864 2020-11-08 12:38:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Kane9015 @Jroxer99 There's a possibility that this is the biggest opportunity we've had in the Trump era. You thought building a wall was nice? Imagine that, free and open election, revealing a grand criminal treasonous conspiracy. Permanently removing the left from power. A man can dream.
1325295197304074242 2020-11-08 12:32:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> William Jennings Bryan had an election stolen through voter intimidation. He ran three times. Never give up.
1325294545857294341 2020-11-08 12:30:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy One Struggle right now. All this philosophizing is for the discussion hall when this is all over.
1325293610053591040 2020-11-08 12:26:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @revjackashcraft He's a dweeb. And a Jewish one, so extra dweebish. But God creates heroes from unusual people sometimes.
1325293087506259968 2020-11-08 12:24:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @revjackashcraft Don't believe media reports. It's spin or outright fabrication right now. Information warfare.
1325292700237770753 2020-11-08 12:22:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm a Man of Faith. If it's in the Bible, I believe it. Period. End of story. No debates. God will see us through this. I have Faith in Him, not Trump.
1325292279284830209 2020-11-08 12:21:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @revjackashcraft We can only hope he is and he's out. Best ending to this story. I'll take whatever allies we can, though. I don't care about past political differences. We're in One Struggle mode right now.
1325291896671973376 2020-11-08 12:19:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Don't believe anything from any reporters. If the last five years has taught you anything, it should be that.
1325291786894446592 2020-11-08 12:19:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MoultriePatriot Yeah, all media is trash.

1325290912612818945 2020-11-08 12:15:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I participated in one last Sunday. Was exciting doing it on the Beltway, offending the DC Elitists. There's hundreds of thousands of us in your own backyard, snob.
1325290267654709248 2020-11-08 12:13:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp The average one did. Heck, a lot of people on *our* side thought they were legit. Thought the random Trump parades throughout the nation weren't representative of much. No President has had this kind of support. Of course, some are just jealous of the loyalty of Trump's base.
1325289410368327685 2020-11-08 12:09:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm really energized tonight after spending much of the day in physical labor. This is fun. The Democrats' fraud is far too obvious. Not sure even the world's best crook could have made this look believable, though. No phony "elite" could have seen Trump's groundswell.

1325287482267734017 2020-11-08 12:02:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm calling on Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the Second to recognize Donald Trump as the legitimate President. She can also seize personal government from Boris Johnson and her other PMs while she's at it.
1325286382521167873 2020-11-08 11:57:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> One word on "coping." You'll never get anywhere in life if you don't take your setbacks and turn them into opportunities. I've personally learned this lesson the hard way sometimes. It's ok to find new avenues to victory after every setback: That's life.
1325286089007968262 2020-11-08 11:56:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @paulasport20011 MSNBC reported it as well. Everyone agrees these favor Trump. Might even help expose the mail in fraud going on.
1325285761575424003 2020-11-08 11:55:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperWars @RedEaglePatriot *decrease share.
1325285719095566336 2020-11-08 11:55:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperWars @RedEaglePatriot The "exit polls" this year included large samples of early voters who were polled by other methods than the traditional in person survey after leaving the polling place.
1325285561150550018 2020-11-08 11:54:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperWars @RedEaglePatriot They were. They had to find somewhere for Trump to increase share. They know some of Trump's fiercest base are PopNats and they'll seize on this narrative of "White men abandoned Trump." Everything is faked at this point, you can't trust anything.
1325285102734221318 2020-11-08 11:52:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GoogleAgorism I like the move. Enjoy life. This might get rough for a while. His supporters are on the streets. It's our turn to do our duty.
1325284832310685698 2020-11-08 11:51:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot He only lost share among White men because of the dead vote. You know it's true. All those people registered in 1900? White men.
1325284343632293890 2020-11-08 11:49:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I guess Caesar gave up because the Senate voted.

1325283165003538434 2020-11-08 11:45:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Checking to see if dead relatives voted in California. Unfortunately, I need their DL#s and who keeps that around?
1325281257455054848 2020-11-08 11:37:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JashuaParez Hundreds of thousands more votes in these states with shrinking populations with 90% turnout and dirty voter rolls. Right.
1325280377422929923 2020-11-08 11:33:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump only lost share among White men because of the dead White male vote.

1325273374088704000 2020-11-08 11:06:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> You need to be helping Donald Trump with your excess energy. He may have few allies right now. Let him know his people are with him.
1325273085038223360 2020-11-08 11:05:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 Good. Means Trump still has votes out there. Potentially netting tens of thousands.
1325272919002517505 2020-11-08 11:04:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Joe Biden is not a legitimate President. Praying for him would be no different than praying for a usurper on the throne: You should pray he relents his treason.

1325262805172432896 2020-11-08 10:24:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Very few Evangelicals were fooled by McMullin and of those who were, they immediately regretted their actions and a lot woke to the glowie because of it.
1325261757535969280 2020-11-08 10:19:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> BTW, guys, I'm actually shocked at these results. I was expecting to be disappointed with some 66-33 margin. Instead Trump ran up his dictator margins here as usual for the GOP.
1325260201738588160 2020-11-08 10:13:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp There's definitely a class of sweater vest old school Republican Evangelical voter that doesn't like Donald Trump. This is a small minority, though.
1325259725349511168 2020-11-08 10:11:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "Donald Trump is unpopular with young Evangelicals, especially college educated young Evangelicals."  Results from Liberty University's polling station: Donald J. Trump: 1,197 Joseph R. Biden: 117  (I'm guessing LU told their PA students to vote in PA, explains lower turnout).
1325257534840705026 2020-11-08 10:03:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Election Fraud is treason.
1325255839213621248 2020-11-08 09:56:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I legit have a phone that is associated with three South Carolina Democrats and you don't want me to think there's voter fraud somewhere?
1325253675586101248 2020-11-08 09:47:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Golfing while your enemies gleefully assert your coming demise and vindictive punishment is probably the most chad move I've ever seen. "Yeah, whatever guys, you know I always win in the end."

1325250408093265920 2020-11-08 09:34:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump is unpopular! He has been abandoned by his own base!  Trump: Turns out 8 million more voters and counting.

1325249297982640132 2020-11-08 09:30:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biden:  Fake News. Fake Votes. Fake President.
1325248937247305728 2020-11-08 09:29:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Good point.
1325248180871704578 2020-11-08 09:26:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump is really an Old School Whig advocating the American System.
1325247116948754432 2020-11-08 09:21:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MotherRobinson3 @RealAPolitics Michigan will be flipped too. Perhaps even Minnesota when all is said and done. The fraud is truly immense. It may seem unbelievable, and maybe we won't prove it all, but believe. There were fraud ballots manufactured in every Democrat post office in every fraud state.

1325240282514944000 2020-11-08 08:54:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 Don't give up hope. I truly believe we're in this together. Restoring one of our countries will eventually lead to restoring all of them.

1325239952259641344 2020-11-08 08:53:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JonMeyersSF Oh, no, Trump finally asks our allies to carry their own weight so we can take care of our own people for a change.

For the record, there was no way for him to pass comprehensive immigration reform with the makeup of the House and Senate in 2017-18. 52 Senators, 7 of whom are total traitors, is not many.
1325236888249241603 2020-11-08 08:41:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NewEra_05 Don't even contemplate it, we're going to win this. The fraud is too obvious.

1325233923992006659 2020-11-08 08:29:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I don't even know how, but I feel even more energy than I did before the election. There was always uncertainty before the election, but we got the votes and they faked there. The energy is just there. We will win, come hell or high water.
1325232760953434113 2020-11-08 08:24:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 I have Canadian ancestry. Hits you in the gut.
1325232601431494658 2020-11-08 08:24:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep It is. But, given BoJo’s congratulations, everyone but Australia has fallen so far. Not sure what’s going on Down Undah. One Right wing Senator is spreading the word on the fraud.

What happens *every* election in these counties is that these machines "fix" ballots from their wards. Mysteriously ballots from the few GOP friendly wards in a place like Philly or Milwaukee go missing. 1/2
1325230220627091462 2020-11-08 08:14:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK They hate it when you’re happy.
1325228920732590087 2020-11-08 08:09:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy He brought back dignity to millions of people and they wanted to reward him at the ballot box. They were denied their franchise and we can't let that happen.
1325228499062444032 2020-11-08 08:07:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob No legitimate government means anarchy. Our government's legitimacy index has been collapsing for decades. We may be seeing the breaking point.
1325228141913251843 2020-11-08 08:06:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> You'd expect given the trends in Ohio, Trump to win by about 1-3% in Pennsylvania (there's always deviation). But these mysterious all Biden mail ins no one reported before the election are flowing out of every post office in the Commonwealth.
1325227598704685056 2020-11-08 08:04:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Some of Biden's support increase over Hillary in some counties is naturally high turnout. In a high turnout election more of both sides show up (usually). See 2004. However, these trends are totally broken when you cross into the fraud states.
1325226784451940364 2020-11-08 08:01:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis Trump didn't get more minority votes because he pandered. He did it because he delivered. He also delivered for WWC people, which is why he's racking up huge vote totals. Forget Biden's totals: We really don't know how many of those votes are fake.
1325225978810011649 2020-11-08 07:57:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark @ramzpaul Americans must chimp. We do not accept a Biden steal.
1325225800979845126 2020-11-08 07:57:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump is going to get over a million votes in Maricopa when this is all set and done. How many of Biden's million or so were from Adrian Fontes' buddies at the Fraudsmiths' Guild in the back of the Central Phoenix Post Office.
1325224552448856066 2020-11-08 07:52:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky Get on the team, Ryan. This election wasn't legitimate and Trump got 205K more votes in Wisconsin and many hundreds of thousands more in PA and MI as well. This isn't because he lost support: It's fraud.
1325224314279505923 2020-11-08 07:51:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Ryan: Stop peddling this nonsense. Trump got 205K more people in Wisconsin to the polls. In a state like Wisconsin, that's an ungodly number of people. This isn't because Trump lost White Working Class support. Your narrative is dumb. Get on the team.
1325223913777991680 2020-11-08 07:49:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Th0mist @GroyperWars @RealAPolitics Get on the team. Whatever the team wants to do, do it. This election was not legitimate, you cannot be on the team if you think it was.

A new election was ordered in North Carolina over 500 bundled ballots when the margin of victory was just over a thousands. Where there's smoke, there's fire.

1325217913209561088 2020-11-08 07:25:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics That narrative is that Trump supposedly had people abandon him en masse in these places, but the reality is that he convinced more people everywhere. Even Dem strongholds. Some is natural high turnout, but the trends are extremely suspect where they occur.
1325217677045080065 2020-11-08 07:24:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Not even. Trump has gotten new votes across the board. I imagine you can find some shrinking rural counties where Trump got less votes, but I haven't been able to identify anywhere he actually lost votes in terms of absolute number. Not much evidence, but it is odd...
1325217247934164992 2020-11-08 07:23:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @SouthernConsDem The Electoral College hasn't even met or been counted. He isn't officially President-Elect until at least then.

1325216381097271299 2020-11-08 07:19:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @conn_paleo That's including the previously reported mail ins, which were 350K.

1325215748768354304 2020-11-08 07:17:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Philadelphia had 650K ballots as of 6:30 PM on Tuesday afternoon. Where did the others come from?
1325215635521986561 2020-11-08 07:16:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics It was record turnout. Even though these mail ins were totally unreported and there were no long lines at polling stations reported....anywhere!

1325208695765004290 2020-11-08 06:49:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Boris Johnson publicly congratulating Biden tells you how international this fraud is. No doubt in my mind Europe overreacted to Covid to cover for Dems here. Someone probably forgot to pass the memo to Sweden.

1325202155616280576 2020-11-08 06:23:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Been saying this since 2018: 2016-2020 will be the nadir of the GOP in California. Already starting the rebound. On Trump Latinos. If you told anyone that on June 17th, 2015, they'd have told you that you're a psycho. We knew it was inevitable.

1325177700068122625 2020-11-08 04:45:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy That’s definitely part of it. Ironically most of these guys are actually professional class. They’re not in touch with plumbers in Erie County, Pennsylvania. They’re just ideologues who mostly live major metros.

1325132753810042881 2020-11-08 01:47:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation If you don’t find it suspicious that it’s only these sketchy mail in voting rule states and sometimes counties, I really think you need to turn up your noticing meter. Trump doesn’t get more than 10% more votes in a declining population state and have Biden get just enough more.
1325132381263638530 2020-11-08 01:45:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation The absolute percentage is more interesting than the margin here. That was pretty far apart, but Ohio is 2% more Republican overall. I can’t find an election they’ve trended *against* each other. Especially when Trump got as many votes as expected. Also, get on the team.
1325131393056219136 2020-11-08 01:41:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark Well, they might stuff the box for a Mitt Romney once every couple decades to keep the charade going.
1325130895255203841 2020-11-08 01:39:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I reiterate my position that I’m with Trump ALL THE WAY.
1325130192688472064 2020-11-08 01:37:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Where Trump’s votes were spot on, but Biden’s votes are not.

1325087826279616512 2020-11-07 22:48:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Let me reiterate my position: I support Trump all the way and hope he fights this obvious fraud all the way.
1325086373083295745 2020-11-07 22:43:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This despite 95% GOP approval ratings and the only primary challengers in the GOP were crushed.
1325085838569574402 2020-11-07 22:40:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @RupertVonRipp @TxGirly83 @Rasmussen_Poll @NickJFuentes Just look at Virginia-1, where Biden has an extra like 85K votes that didn’t vote in the Congressional race. Somehow this district swung 20 points against Trump, but not the GOP? With a 95% GOP approval rating?
1325084406344658945 2020-11-07 22:35:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @TxGirly83 @Rasmussen_Poll @NickJFuentes Yeah, I’d buy this narrative if these people had voted for Biden and then voted GOP for the House, but the mysteriously disappearing votes for House is extremely weird.
1325083946879766529 2020-11-07 22:33:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wandlearner @Jroxer99 Yeah, I found the 2000 number most interesting. What’s weird is Trump is gaining vote share in Pennsylvania. Like it’s just odd how fast Biden stacks up votes in these key states that basically don’t match anywhere else.
1325083474030702598 2020-11-07 22:31:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The cuckservative.

1325083009683509249 2020-11-07 22:29:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark I mean, no one thinks Biden, a dementia patient, had people so inspired that they delivered last minute mail in ballots with 95-5 dictator margins in the middle of the night.
1325075298589831168 2020-11-07 21:59:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 It’s extremely rare for Ohio to trend against Pennsylvania. And when they do, it’s by a small margin.
1325074788503662592 2020-11-07 21:57:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Kane9015 Or Ohio, which has the same basic laws on this stuff theoretically.
1325073992777150467 2020-11-07 21:53:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Can someone find an election in our history where Ohio and Pennsylvania voted 8 points apart?
1325072364535762944 2020-11-07 21:47:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Another day. Another midnight ballot dump.
1325070678282932224 2020-11-07 21:40:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark They apparently found more ballots in Georgia.
1324968633404170241 2020-11-07 14:55:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing Dems do straight up voter intimidation on those folks. Evil.
1324968536201187328 2020-11-07 14:54:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It’s amazing that for an election with such high turnout, we have such a low proportion for first time voters in early voting. And they tended to favor Republican demos.
1324968303761252352 2020-11-07 14:53:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Have we found out if the youth voters who never registered and never sent in their mail in ballots mysteriously had their ballots harvested at the last minute?

1324964072169803777 2020-11-07 14:37:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou What’s going on here appears to be too massive to be believed, but we both know these people are capable of anything.

1324961469792989185 2020-11-07 14:26:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dhizzyNYR @RupertVonRipp @RealAPolitics I’d expect that to make some difference, but drive out an extra  500K Dems over 2016? Give me a break.
1324960381811486720 2020-11-07 14:22:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @dhizzyNYR @RealAPolitics I honestly think the fraud in PA is systematic. Occurred in every county. Not necessarily at the county level, but the way PA apparently conducted its mail ins and the high number of provisional ballots make me sus.
1324960019037696000 2020-11-07 14:20:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @dhizzyNYR @RealAPolitics You can go on Google maps and see some communities straddle the state line.
1324959706193010689 2020-11-07 14:19:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MGMJohn_Sonic6 @RealAPolitics They too have multiple rounds. Simple fact is no one uses simple popular vote. They always use multiple rounds. They also run their elections in a constitutionally different manner.

1324957645053243392 2020-11-07 14:11:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks @AStratelates LBJ being legendary for his fraud capabilities.
1324956201654874112 2020-11-07 14:05:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @RealAPolitics Same with PA. Not sure there has ever been an election in our entire history PA and OH have been this far apart. Usually PA is about 2-4 points bluer at most.
1324955328954372096 2020-11-07 14:02:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Broward County was like 4% more Republican and it’s a suburban county with extremely unfavorable demographics for Republicans.
1324947800321368064 2020-11-07 13:32:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 Here’s the thing: We don’t need to prove every single instance of fraud. The stuff adding up here is more than enough coincidences to make us distrust the sources of the data. When we can’t trust the source, we can’t trust the votes they’re producing.
1324946823648305152 2020-11-07 13:28:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 The Benford Analysis going around is mostly analyzing this dump.
1324945877144842245 2020-11-07 13:24:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 These votes were very obviously hidden and when they dumped they were 98.7% for Biden.
1324941639777988608 2020-11-07 13:07:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Election Day usually is rigged. Mail ins just make this shit a lot easier to get away with.
1324941429874036741 2020-11-07 13:07:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is why we all thought this couldn’t happen in Wisconsin and yet it did. Because no one holds these people accountable. And yet there are those on the right telling you to accept it because you can’t prove they were fraudulently cast at the moment.
1324934273527373824 2020-11-07 12:38:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @mccarthywzright Nothing to see here. Not like we hadn't already heard stories like this out of Pennsylvania.

1324931199677108225 2020-11-07 12:26:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Let me get this straight: We now have evidence in *two* states that just so happen to be key to Trump's chances that ballots intended for Trump were counted for Biden?
1324927554403315713 2020-11-07 12:11:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan He also "lost White men" despite getting hundreds of thousands more votes.
1324927393371475968 2020-11-07 12:11:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Mysteriously, he lost White men in Pennsylvania, but not Ohio.

1324926935634423808 2020-11-07 12:09:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @EndDemocracy They're claiming the null thing, but needs to be corrected. Like, we can't run elections like this where mysterious midnight ballots break 95-5 for one candidates and a bunch of them are from people with no birthdate.
1324923028963282944 2020-11-07 11:54:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Get in the pod. Drink Starbucks. Eat bugs.  You're a cuck if you accept this shit.

1324920160629747713 2020-11-07 11:42:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TrustThePlant There hasn't been a mysterious Election Day box that shows up post-election for the GOP since like 1888.
1324919760455348225 2020-11-07 11:41:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They still will be paid regardless. Systemic disruption doesn't help them. The problem is that the working class people, especially the working class Whites, need systemic disruption to restore their honorable industry.
1324919518544744448 2020-11-07 11:40:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is just an extension of the class war that's going on. With the exception of some few real patriots who understand how society should function, Trump's professional class supporters are mostly comfortable in their sinecures regardless of outcome. 1/2
1324918437089603586 2020-11-07 11:35:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Libs think Bush stole Ohio in 2004. I forgot the reasoning. Something, something voter suppression.
1324917891167358976 2020-11-07 11:33:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @KingBroly Indiana is more for Trump now than in 2016. Rural counties in Kentucky basically matched their 2016 margins. Similar story in Tennessee. Georgia rurals aren't Atlanta. They should still trend with other Southern rurals.

1324913200693989376 2020-11-07 11:14:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly @realikamusume It would explain the slightly smaller margins there despite the huge increase in votes.
1324912714662207488 2020-11-07 11:13:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou In Florida, they definitely classify mail ins, IPEVs, and EVs separately.
1324912201463975945 2020-11-07 11:10:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I'm seeing some statistics from some places, but it's limited. I found one county earlier where the absentee vote split was 51-45 Trump. Only one I saw outside Pennsylvania. Can't find it now, though.
1324911670016290816 2020-11-07 11:08:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 20 million of which were completely hidden from public view until after the election.
1324911527867060225 2020-11-07 11:08:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Have any mail in ballots discovered at midnight narrowed the results in Ohio?
1324910795550044160 2020-11-07 11:05:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou TargetSmart was basically spot on in Ohio, Florida, Texas, etc. Then you hit the rust belt and some counties in Georgia and it's terrible.
1324909975378997254 2020-11-07 11:02:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I don't care how unreasonable you think Trump's idea that hundreds of thousands, nay, millions of votes may be fraudulent, he has a right to make his case and it should be investigated and we should back him.
1324909672382521345 2020-11-07 11:00:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The thing that gets me is that there are way more mail in ballots than requests before election day. Super fishy.
1324905313481469954 2020-11-07 10:43:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou And this was just an "honest mistake" (AKA standard Dem machine politics). Not a global media elite conspiracy.
1324905021629149184 2020-11-07 10:42:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We're not on copium until after Trump concedes (which he will not). Then we cope. Then we hope again when we fight again.
1324903810184192002 2020-11-07 10:37:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Really, already releasing this three days after the election.
1324900623595220993 2020-11-07 10:24:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb @MonarchistSpirt Ok, officially blocking you.
1324898695180120066 2020-11-07 10:17:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They're moving in.
1324897239072972800 2020-11-07 10:11:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiah_crawley I'm just waiting to see if the Blue States start manufacturing votes just to help their buddies out and evade capture.
1324896206548586499 2020-11-07 10:07:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiah_crawley 2/2 But not even Hoover was so unpopular that FDR had tens of thousands of over votes compared to House races because people simply didn't vote there.
1324895997433163777 2020-11-07 10:06:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiah_crawley I'm not really educated enough to analyze it, but I'm buying at this point on the gut level. Taking everything together and you're seeing just crazy anomalies and we're supposed to believe it's all because Orange Man Bad. There have been unpopular Presidents. 1/2
1324895315674148865 2020-11-07 10:03:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 That's what you'd expect to see if an incumbent were reelected. We haven't had an incumbent lose reelection without an increase in third party vote ever as far as I'm aware. Certainly not in the 20th Century. There even was in the 1932 landslide.
1324894438745907200 2020-11-07 10:00:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> But only in key swing states. Nowhere else was energized. Because they're a swing state or something.
1324894130351300608 2020-11-07 09:59:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Urban turnout was down as a share of the vote throughout the country prior to Election Day. Suddenly, massive spikes of urban voters post-election going 95-5 for Biden. Screw this.
1324893867901120512 2020-11-07 09:58:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm convinced this is the biggest steal ever conducted in history at this point.
1324893687277641729 2020-11-07 09:57:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's a "clerical error."
1324893372834832388 2020-11-07 09:56:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @o_visc @CitadelMark These people didn't just vote for Biden and then vote Republican. They didn't vote for Congress *at all*.
1324891038855680002 2020-11-07 09:46:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark I should note that the Senate candidate Mark Warner also was the beneficiary of these overvotes somehow. You should lookup what happened in 2014 in Virginia and how what was supposed to be a comfortable Warner reelection turned into a nail biter decided by Fairfax County.
1324889649605709824 2020-11-07 09:41:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark This is bigger than I even imagined possible. I can't believe that many people literally just voted Biden and left. Have you heard of any of these "Biden only" voters? Where are they coming from?
1324889337121660928 2020-11-07 09:40:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics @TeamTrump St. Louis County is weird man: Even the NYTimes polled it and had Trump leading there. He has enough votes to have swung it to his column from 2016, but Biden mysteriously has 8,000 more votes than Clinton.   That's a long time corrupt County too.
1324888091090411526 2020-11-07 09:35:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LarryJB33 This is extremely weird. Where the frick do these ballots come from? This has me concerned.
1324880601992794112 2020-11-07 09:05:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @katiehasedits @RealAPolitics Nebraska segregates its electors by district.
1324877936684634113 2020-11-07 08:54:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Single payer wasn't even a winner in the Dem primaries. It's underwater nationally. Public option is an ok compromise.
1324877376522772481 2020-11-07 08:52:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Sorbetti4 @RealAPolitics @joehiden16 Yeah, I'm not seeing this.
1324876848975777796 2020-11-07 08:50:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics I think this is a typo.
1324876501238603777 2020-11-07 08:49:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Where are you seeing this?
1324876002900791301 2020-11-07 08:47:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FrankRory81 @thehangingchads That's what makes this all so weird. The rust belt is seeing turnout increases on par with states with fast growing populations when their populations are declining or growing incredibly slowly.
1324874615274037248 2020-11-07 08:41:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dufus38605342 @RedEaglePatriot 60% would do it. 120,000 over 80,000 would put Trump at a 4K vote lead.
1324873102367584259 2020-11-07 08:35:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy He's going to get more votes in every state of the Union. Here in Fairfax we didn't hit 2016 turnout as of 5 PM on Election Day. Mysteriously we have like 75K more now. No one reported any lines at the polling stations.
1324871758768463877 2020-11-07 08:30:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BobLobl53498620 It's the illegals. Chicago and Philadelphia have dead people. California has illegals registered by the Department of Mexican Voters.
1324871411014496257 2020-11-07 08:28:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates It wouldn't shock me to find out dozens of offices are stolen every General Election.
1324869723616649218 2020-11-07 08:22:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JimmyKPolk11 @SelimSeesYou @trafalgar_group Miami: Reports a million or so votes basically instantly.   Philadelphia: Oh, we have an extra 100K mail ins sitting in the back. Not sure where they came from, but we swear they’re legit.
1324868923326656512 2020-11-07 08:19:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume This could end up as big as the committee reports of yore.
1324868294785032193 2020-11-07 08:16:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JimmyKPolk11 @SelimSeesYou @trafalgar_group Broward County is mysteriously 4% more Republican this year. I thought the suburbs hated Trump? Especially in a place like Broward County.
1324866638735405058 2020-11-07 08:09:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy A fraudulent part of the Constitution anyway. We need this spirit of 19th Century compromise if we are to survive this and neither side seems to have it. Our side is composed of cucks or hawks and their side is mostly just hawks.
1324865719369150465 2020-11-07 08:06:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LockheartApril @realikamusume We’re all in.
1324865474203627520 2020-11-07 08:05:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Word of warning: Basically the only reason war didn’t breakout over 1876 is everyone was still tired from the last one.
1324865312261607427 2020-11-07 08:04:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Charlemagne_03 All in.
1324864479314710528 2020-11-07 08:01:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 1876 Presidential Election. This isn’t unprecedented even on this level. If the House of Representatives needs to vote by state delegation, that’s what needs to happen.
1324863823942127620 2020-11-07 07:58:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FrankieFlames @Miche1T Even the Military should have special polling stations setup and their votes transported in a very secure and orderly manner.
1324862518846689289 2020-11-07 07:53:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CYBERFRNT @punisheddixie Clearly GOP voter suppression. They don't want the Black vote to count.
1324861878066155527 2020-11-07 07:51:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FrankieFlames @Miche1T California has had a lot of Congressional races flipped over the years from mail in ballots flowing in weeks after the election. Been going on since at least 2010 or so. Notably, after the last California Republican left the Secretary of State's Office in 2007.
1324861004719796225 2020-11-07 07:47:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @yemanouspeak Biden’s team wasn’t.
1324860369991577600 2020-11-07 07:45:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FrankieFlames @Miche1T Democratic states in general seem very bad at counting votes.
1324860283651756033 2020-11-07 07:44:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FrankieFlames @Miche1T California is still counting votes.
1324858032241643521 2020-11-07 07:35:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 He'll probably end up closer to 3.4 when all is set and done after the 200K votes outstanding are counted, many of which are provisional ballots in Trump Country.
1324857477314334730 2020-11-07 07:33:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Chfl_malcontent Yeah, the political front is merely to give legitimacy to our continued waging of guerilla information warfare.
1324856656476385283 2020-11-07 07:30:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They wanted to call the Election sooner for Biden, but the votes Trump tallied up were shocking even to them. They don't want us knowing how many of us there really are.
1324856014055919619 2020-11-07 07:27:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’ve spent the past 3 days trying to find the FNC app on my phone to delete and I finally found it. No more trash “Fox News Alerts” which were clickbait anyway.
1324853658316689409 2020-11-07 07:18:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou Trump will teach them.
1324853254933590021 2020-11-07 07:16:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OfficialWG_ "This Confederate Veteran has been voting straight Democrat since 1860. He might have voted for the Whig his first election, we don't really know."
1324852909297848321 2020-11-07 07:15:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Bush v. Gore says the Legislature's authority on the matter is plenary. Not answerable to anyone.
1324852794113822720 2020-11-07 07:14:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Prepare for the highest turnout runoffs in the history of the State of Georgia.
1324852051717836800 2020-11-07 07:11:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @oglethorp12 I heard the last Maricopa vote dump was bad news. Don't have much news how much is outstanding there.
1324850263065305102 2020-11-07 07:04:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Anyone know how many votes are outstanding in Arizona? Info is all over the board.
1324849843576147969 2020-11-07 07:03:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics In Navajo County? Wow. That county is usually pretty 50-50.
1324848367936176133 2020-11-07 06:57:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @patrickbasedmn I think we lost Indiana and added Louisiana over 2016. Would have to go back and check.  Ladies: Don't look for husbands in the blue male states.
1324845249903079424 2020-11-07 06:44:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs>  https://t.co/xPIB98PfPR
1324844371657805825 2020-11-07 06:41:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Yes, there would have been mysterious last minute ballots after the Panhandle reported.
1324843503017447424 2020-11-07 06:38:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan They didn't have any "mail in ballots" heretofore unrequested and uncounted to find in some back alley somewhere. Had to rely on old fashioned box stuffing.
1324842821409480706 2020-11-07 06:35:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan They waited for the calls in all of them to see how many ballots were outstanding in the cities. Mysteriously this never happens in states like Florida or Texas or Ohio with massive cities.
1324842605117640712 2020-11-07 06:34:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Georgia is a good example. Trump won that by 5 points and they waited *forever* to call that because Fulton was trying to print ballots like crazy. Realized the lead was too strong to overtake.
1324842019949334531 2020-11-07 06:32:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I like how no one remembers that they tried to pull the same midnight ballot garbage on a smaller scale in 2016. They just weren't prepared for Trump to even be in a position to win because they believed their own trash polls.
1324837086906769410 2020-11-07 06:12:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dsdav3 @ScottMGreer Ted Cruz would go up by about a million percent in my book.
1324836397207949312 2020-11-07 06:09:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @ScottMGreer Or Adrian Fontes did.
1324833813768392705 2020-11-07 05:59:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 Of that, there's little doubt.
1324833103957893127 2020-11-07 05:56:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Block all lib trolls. Ignore lib troll postings.

1324831323853410306 2020-11-07 05:49:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CalebJHull @trailbla_zing We live in two different countries at this point.
1324830901088493572 2020-11-07 05:47:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly Ok, he's going off mute and into block. Screw this cad.
1324829899526492161 2020-11-07 05:43:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @punisheddixie Always in one direction and always in Democrat Counties.
1324826000472027137 2020-11-07 05:28:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Yeah, a few states here and there have gotten bluer or redder, but it's not some massive swing.
1324825566072197120 2020-11-07 05:26:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Taliaferro_98 The entire thing is a meme anyway. There's very little evidence there was a regression of Trump support among WWC voters anywhere outside the three states in dispute. He got 205K more votes in Wisconsin: That's not some small number.
1324824289489625089 2020-11-07 05:21:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They're claiming this a "realignment" election. Except it really isn't in the red states or swingish states where the Republicans are strict with election law like Florida, Ohio, and Texas (besides that Harris County drive-thru voting fiasco).
1324823907317284864 2020-11-07 05:20:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Adam_Reynold5 @PapaUrbanusII @NationalistTV Oh, yeah, I'm actually convinced Bush won Pennsylvania in 2004 now as well. Maybe Wisconsin too. Not that it really matters much as he sucked and it was just standard games the Dems play.
1324823705768370176 2020-11-07 05:19:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> You can only rig elections in districts you control. That's part of what makes the rigging so obvious: In districts and states they do not control, the GOP is making significant gains up and down the ballot, including the Presidential level.
1324819592523427842 2020-11-07 05:02:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy If the Dispie premills end up being right....Oh geez. This ain't going to be pretty.
1324819014829416450 2020-11-07 05:00:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @CitadelMark Vaccine you can do by making it part of some kind of employment scheme.
1324818918712762368 2020-11-07 05:00:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @CitadelMark Mass gun confiscation is harder logistically than a mandatory vaccine. There are simply tens of million of "assault weapons" out there and going door to door would likely cause a civil war.
1324817164130463744 2020-11-07 04:53:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnonTrump66 @RealAPolitics Yeah, this shit is creepy. I expected slightly higher than expected Biden totals for a variety of reasons, but this is all too damn convenient where and when they occur.
1324816970194292737 2020-11-07 04:52:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou They should recall the bitter Democratic primary contest that year that Obama basically stole from Hillary.
1324812238230867972 2020-11-07 04:33:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JorgvonWartburg @RealAPolitics You'd have to go through the timeline. He predicted the Trump tally at 3.4 million in PA and that's what it's heading towards after the provisionals and remaining mail ins are counted. He predicted Trump would lose Nevada by 8000 votes.
1324811716778229762 2020-11-07 04:31:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The number of Trump votes is going to basically exactly match the @RealAPolitics model in all these swing states and it's kind of creepy.
1324811036474617859 2020-11-07 04:28:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RoyalistW As monarchists, we value legitimacy above all. Illegitimate government, whether it be by rigged election or usurpers on the throne, is the death of a nation.
1324810719339098112 2020-11-07 04:27:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Dadetalian Maybe the fact the Trumpist Modern Steppe Truck Hordes coming out this weekend has them scared.
1324810490674057217 2020-11-07 04:26:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep We all know Wisconsin was robbed anyway.
1324809728590073859 2020-11-07 04:23:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BloomerUSA @CitadelMark BALLOT BOMB EVERYONE RUN
1324807799793242118 2020-11-07 04:16:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> That's an insane number of provisional ballots. These are people who had someone vote for them by mail, most likely (that's the proper procedure if you dispute that you had a mail in vote cast in your name, but Dem machines don't do it, btw).
1324799181878448128 2020-11-07 03:41:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump got more Election Day votes in Pennsylvania than his own campaign expected.
1324798374881746945 2020-11-07 03:38:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume They’re angry they didn’t get away with it.
1324798118718824449 2020-11-07 03:37:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Been seeing them since yesterday.
1324795438046859265 2020-11-07 03:27:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ValarAddemmis @SelimSeesYou Maybe, but it's best to give it our best shot and Trump will be basically a shadow President for the next 4 years. We can stop this. In the meantime, double down our efforts to clean up the Republican Party.
1324794489752428552 2020-11-07 03:23:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Then run again in 2024.
1324793863291240448 2020-11-07 03:20:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ValarAddemmis @SelimSeesYou I don't understand the point of not even getting our best shot. If the Republicans look to cuck, get out in the streets. That's how we stopped the 2006 amnesty: Mass flooding of Congressional offices with demands to stop it. It WORKED. And there's more of us now.
1324793665039048704 2020-11-07 03:19:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ValarAddemmis @SelimSeesYou The GOP gained in the House and it's a purer party there as well. Not even clear you can get a clean vote in the House for amnesty as there are some Democrats who are still dependent on opposing it. It will be a narrow vote there if they do: No Mandate.
1324789677463949315 2020-11-07 03:04:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ArmorRenegadeOP @SelimSeesYou They can, but I don't understand what the point of not even trying is.
1324789389474615299 2020-11-07 03:02:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ValarAddemmis @SelimSeesYou We have a record on this: 32 Republicans voted no on Gang of 8 (including Mitch McConnell). Of the ones who voted for it, only 6 are left and at least one has explicitly changed positions. The newbies are all elected from Trump states on Trump platforms. They can filibuster.
1324787389961768961 2020-11-07 02:55:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ValarAddemmis @SelimSeesYou He wanted significant concessions: Full funding of the wall, a very long pathway to citizenship, and to limit chain migration. He wasn’t just demanding 5 billion over the wall. It was a reasonable deal. The 5 billion was the shutdown.
1324786719460380677 2020-11-07 02:52:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ValarAddemmis @SelimSeesYou That wasn’t about actually passing amnesty. Trump was playing a game with Democrats to show how unreasonable they are.
1324786458968903682 2020-11-07 02:51:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon This was always my fear with these early mail ins. Part of the reason I do not recognize the legitimacy of a Biden Presidency in any event.
1324785883434856448 2020-11-07 02:49:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There was a sizable increase in the number of “75+” first time voters this election. At first I thought this was favorable to Trump. Now I’m not so sure.
1324784515080966144 2020-11-07 02:43:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ValarAddemmis @SelimSeesYou No, they would not. The GOP is a much purer party now than it was in 2013.
1324784355533836290 2020-11-07 02:42:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PollySpin @SelimSeesYou They prevented it in 2013 and 2006 in spite of much stronger political forces wanting it. This just doesn't hold up to history.
1324784059353096193 2020-11-07 02:41:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The left wins because they want it more. They've never given up. Reagan won a 49 state landslide reelection and they insult his legacy and defend Carter's crushing defeat. You can't win if you don't want it more in this tight contest.
1324783529969045504 2020-11-07 02:39:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I can't agree with this. GOP can prevent amnesty if GOP controls the Senate. They have a mandate to do it.
1324782411364864000 2020-11-07 02:35:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It was a map of trends in Wisconsin.
1324782332864270340 2020-11-07 02:34:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The only way this election makes sense is if we acknowledge we are a deeply divided people and come up with a way basically half the country doesn't have its way of life at stake every 4 years. This is the peaceful thing to do, but one side won't allow it and will rig the system.  https://t.co/OZtBlipbZY
1324780401483780096 2020-11-07 02:27:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Look, we have the courts. DACA was an obvious unconstitutional sham. Roberts can't kill us now either.
1324777456558026758 2020-11-07 02:15:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @AnOrthodoxLife Oh, ok, good. They haven't called Alaska yet and theoretically, Republicans are the more likely source of election fraud in that state if we're being honest (Alaska GOP is utterly corrupt).
1324776577561960450 2020-11-07 02:12:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Amnesty will not pass a GOP Senate. Would be political suicide. Maybe they're suicidal, but I doubt they're that suicidal. Do you have another solution besides just withdrawing?
1324776121813131266 2020-11-07 02:10:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW What do you mean? A bunch of hidden Biden votes?
1324775735270277124 2020-11-07 02:08:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan The midterms will be impossible to stuff to this level. We control the State Houses. Force Floridian Elections Reform.
1324775463055724547 2020-11-07 02:07:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "Let's unite the country."  Also: "At least 70 million of you and likely your children are vile beasts who can't have a voice in the future."
1324774684999692288 2020-11-07 02:04:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan I understand, but don't stop the fight regardless.
1324774020957544449 2020-11-07 02:01:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @kansaspower Agreed.
1324773814744612864 2020-11-07 02:01:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TennentsPlease The late hour some of these guys were still denigrating Trump was galling. They knew what was at stake and couldn't help but peddle their ideological agendas.
1324773297402351617 2020-11-07 01:59:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Democrats are already trying to claim some kind of mandate to do mass amnesty and whatever.
1324772953997877251 2020-11-07 01:57:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump didn't lose because they failed to get more voter registrations among his WWC. This should be obvious from vote totals.
1324772412718809088 2020-11-07 01:55:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer Before someone points out that Trump eked out wins in the three rust belts: Yes, they were, but he still got more votes than any previous GOP nominee while Hillary got basically what Obama did in 2012, just in the wrong places.
1324771661472763905 2020-11-07 01:52:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer Trump is crushing every GOP nominee in history in the PV right now. Including himself. Biden eked out a win in like 4 states.
1324770367794282501 2020-11-07 01:47:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb @joshuaduffey3 It's your moral duty to determine the legitimate authorities to obey and which to not. It's in the Bible. Nothing about the Constitution.
1324769797763190785 2020-11-07 01:45:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb @joshuaduffey3 If it isn't morally binding, it isn't legally binding either. God is our judge. If he finds it acceptable, you should too.
1324769276230832130 2020-11-07 01:43:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb @joshuaduffey3 Saying it is morally binding is claiming divine right.
1324769172212121601 2020-11-07 01:42:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FlycatcherSilky @GladstonianLib Voters thought Trump could take it because there has long been a dream (especially on the Republican side) of a businessman coming in and cleaning house. Pundits? No. Carlson is far too ideological and nerdy for the average voter. WWC won't get him and neither will Latinos.
1324768686868148234 2020-11-07 01:40:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics So many trends were bucked. I mean, Vigo County and Luzerne, bellwethers upset? There are no more bellwethers if this stands.
1324767145633480704 2020-11-07 01:34:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TristanTheAncap Ourselves.
1324766427799277570 2020-11-07 01:31:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Seriously: It's simple as this, we're right and they're wrong. Nothing else really matters.
1324766126019088385 2020-11-07 01:30:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Libs have no right to moral indignation because their morality is perverted. Ours is not. Big difference.
1324765326869995523 2020-11-07 01:27:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Keep the fight up, @realikamusume. We all deserve a long vacation after all this, but we can't give up if we can't fix this now.
1324765042814967814 2020-11-07 01:26:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb @joshuaduffey3 You mix the two, giving the American Union a divine right it does not and has never claimed for itself.
1324764954571014147 2020-11-07 01:25:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb @joshuaduffey3 Secession from the American government is acceptable under both systems, on different principles: In Traditional Conservatism by asserting divine right to honest government. In Classical Liberalism, by withdrawing consent, which cannot be bind on future generations.
1324764695430123529 2020-11-07 01:24:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb @joshuaduffey3 You cannot be both. In classical liberalism, government is expressly by consent of the government (the people of each state of the Union) and they can withdraw it. In Traditional Conservatism, government is by divine right, which the American Government cannot have.
1324762280668635138 2020-11-07 01:15:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb @joshuaduffey3 Your political beliefs are an irrational mishmash of traditional conservatism and classical liberalism.
1324761992872316929 2020-11-07 01:14:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb @joshuaduffey3 You cannot call yourself a classical liberal and believe what you’re advocating. If the states withdraw consent from the document they consented to *the governed* no longer consent. You can’t bind a future legislature. That’s an ancient law of the Anglo Saxon people.
1324761297041444866 2020-11-07 01:11:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb @joshuaduffey3 This is a government, not a spiritual being.
1324761146512080896 2020-11-07 01:10:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb @joshuaduffey3 You need to be on the team. I’m for whatever the team decides. If it’s separatism: So let it be written, so let it be done. If we decide to fight in the context of the Union: Again, so let it be written, so let it be done.
1324760813052268544 2020-11-07 01:09:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I don’t know, I’m just highly encouraged by how many more people showed up to stand up to 4 years of media lies than last time. I don’t believe we can’t convince more people over the coming years.
1324760279226396676 2020-11-07 01:07:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb @joshuaduffey3 Why is a perpetual union more perfect? That’s just circular reasoning.
1324760096111579137 2020-11-07 01:06:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The number of people who seem to want to concede the *future* to these cretins is what concerns me the most. You need to be ready for another round until we’re all shipped off to gulags.
1324758582466891777 2020-11-07 01:00:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb @joshuaduffey3 If they refuse to be bound by the Constitution and the laws, it is pure cuckery to be held back by some court ruling. Also, the words “perpetual Union” are not in the preamble. We may have usurpers on the throne.
1324756124508311553 2020-11-07 00:50:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright @SelimSeesYou They do cross check the rolls of who voted with the number of ballots and discrepancies lead to questions.
1324755828600168449 2020-11-07 00:49:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Arthur_Fleck20 @GunthBeethoven @JacksonPackson1 @PapaUrbanusII @NationalistTV I’ve been advocating the purple finger method for the future since Tuesday.
1324755279091798019 2020-11-07 00:47:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GladstonianLib I just don’t see him winning a General Election (or even a primary, to be frank). He’d be a Horace Greeley Analog.
1324753551067881475 2020-11-07 00:40:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Supposedly Montana had a competitive Senate Race. Popular Governor Bullock lost by 10%. Same in SC.
1324746758115725315 2020-11-07 00:13:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Or anyone really.
1324746688205148161 2020-11-07 00:13:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Has anyone been leader of a House Party this long after showing this level of unpopularity?
1324745862002675712 2020-11-07 00:10:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb SCOTUS regular makes bad rulings. I do not care.
1324744511403315201 2020-11-07 00:04:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GunthBeethoven @JacksonPackson1 @PapaUrbanusII @NationalistTV They’ve been stuffing the box for decades. International observers from the right think our elections are probably the biggest shams in the Western World. There are third world countries with more honest elections.
1324742050894536706 2020-11-06 23:54:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump has a right to spend the rest of his life claiming the Election was stolen regardless of whether he can prove it in court. That's America.
1324741716688199681 2020-11-06 23:53:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PapaUrbanusII @NationalistTV Democrats always seem to have a lot more people who just vote Prez regardless of the election.
1324739130992087041 2020-11-06 23:43:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trooper097996 There's some dispute about this. The claim is *recent* movers lean father left, whereas older movers (like, pre-2010) lean right.
1324738430627155973 2020-11-06 23:40:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb The Preamble is of no legal effect.
1324738331641552897 2020-11-06 23:40:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> You saw me tracking the early vote every day before the election. I sat there everyday looking at these numbers. The margins of Trump's victory were obvious to anyone watching this and knowing how many would show up on EDay. Except in 5 states. (NV was always a close one).
1324737382462164993 2020-11-06 23:36:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NolteNC @BreitbartNews *isn't
1324737224823476227 2020-11-06 23:35:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There's no denying the fact the Democrats didn't report these mail ins they are finding before the election. They did this on purpose, regardless of how "legitimate" they are. They did it to humiliate you because they don't care about unity: They're trying to provoke you.
1324736381441232896 2020-11-06 23:32:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NolteNC @BreitbartNews There’s no way Trump’s base won’t feel like this is stolen from them.
1324735803222827009 2020-11-06 23:30:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trooper097996 We'd have everything we need, including enough oil. It is obviously the best option on the strategic level. The Division in the state is very high, though. We'd need to flood it with refugees from across the country.
1324734605329604609 2020-11-06 23:25:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing I expected California to be about 10 million votes for Biden to 5 million for Trump before the Election and I think that's where it will end up. Are a million of Biden's votes illegals? Yes, but still.
1324733963139747843 2020-11-06 23:22:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We have to come up with a plan as a team here. Obviously a lot of us have different political philosophies (I'm obviously not an Americanist), but whatever the *team* decides to do, you stick with the team. We can't afford bickering about exact principles.
1324733317653082112 2020-11-06 23:20:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StaresInStoic We all knew it.
1324733184286883840 2020-11-06 23:19:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> With Blacks too. And only in rust belt states.
1324732788923355146 2020-11-06 23:18:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Nomos_Forever I just don't see how we do that right now. If we can, I support it. We have to stick together and come up with a plan as a team. Whatever the team decides, that's what we have to do. If it fails, we try something else.
1324731598978322432 2020-11-06 23:13:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 How so?
1324731477398036484 2020-11-06 23:12:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Nomos_Forever We've recovered from stolen elections before in this country. We can do so again. I get being frustrated with this process, but we're not without recourse. I support Trump going all the way with this, but we cannot permanently concede if we can't overturn this.
1324730712600256512 2020-11-06 23:09:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark Latinos voted for him because he exudes caudilloism. Same reason Anglos cucked. Latino Caudilloism combined with a blue state excess can keep the Sun Belt in our hands.
1324730154829123585 2020-11-06 23:07:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark Trump is going to end up with like 5 million votes in California. If just a fifth of them abandoned the state (that's a tall order, but with tech it might be done), they can secure TX, AZ, and NV fully.
1324729773126537217 2020-11-06 23:06:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark The better move is to completely abandon blue states like CA, NY, VA, MD, etc. and move to competitive states. Not red states, competitive states.
1324729153183191041 2020-11-06 23:03:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 Those states are for those back east. We need to secure these strongholds. The lefties won't leave their bughives.
1324728475530465282 2020-11-06 23:00:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 @FaithGoldy Trump got more votes in every single state. It's clear he didn't lose because he lost voters. One or two random dissatisfieds is inevitable.
1324728281900482561 2020-11-06 23:00:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm calling on every Republican who can leave California, Oregon, or Washington for Nevada or Arizona to do so before the 2022 elections.
1324727784896417793 2020-11-06 22:58:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark @ScottMGreer He can run a shadow Presidency over the next 4 years and either play kingmaker in 2024 Primaries or run again himself and he will win them. We must challenge the GOP Establishment at every opportunity. Every suspicious Congressman in a red district needs challenging.
1324726122714664967 2020-11-06 22:51:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump racked up more votes in every single state of the Union. Don't forget that. There are more of us than there were 4 years ago. There can be even more of us 4 years from now. There's no reason to concede this permanently. Keep the pressure on regardless.
1324725179159896064 2020-11-06 22:47:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb Yeah, the law was you don't get to declare independence against King George over some small taxes. And now we're here. I thought we got to change this arrangement if we're unsatisfied? Clearly nearly half the voting public is dissatisfied.
1324724754092380160 2020-11-06 22:46:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb Apparently the Marines are on the side of Trump. If we have the Marines and all the guns, we win.
1324724499837845507 2020-11-06 22:45:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner I don't know how they can succeed in purging Trumpism. Trump just ran up 70 million votes in the middle of a pandemic and only lost in very suspicious, narrow circumstances after a global media elite conspiracy.
1324724131821166594 2020-11-06 22:43:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb I hope so as well. Hopefully every state gets run like Florida and with extreme consequences next time.
1324723744238161920 2020-11-06 22:42:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Florida had 116% of 2016's turnout in a FAST growing state. Miraculously all of these rust belt states are going to end up with more despite losing population numbers. Bizarre.
1324722517609775105 2020-11-06 22:37:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb What do we do, then?
1324722316669050881 2020-11-06 22:36:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Some people take the American Union as some kind of Jure Divino institution when the American Union doesn't even claim that for itself. You can't have Divine Right if you don't claim it.
1324721991014899713 2020-11-06 22:35:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I honestly don't respect the political philosophy of people who think both that the American Union is some sacrosanct, indissoluble institution AND that the American Revolution was justified. God has allowed nations to split before. He will do so again. Ours isn't that special.
1324721917677490177 2020-11-06 22:34:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trooper097996 Also has defensible frontiers that can be stretched if you include Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and potentially others.
1324720556902666240 2020-11-06 22:29:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cmvalentineb I'd rather concede defeat on some level and allowed to live in peace than fight until forced to unconditional surrender.
1324720230233481216 2020-11-06 22:28:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nived56 @ChaserWestbrook FNC has lost all credibility among ordinary conservatives. They were already losing influence pre-Trump. Now it's over. The jig is up. OAN and Newsmax control a critical mass of GOP voters to win a GOP primary.
1324719982056476672 2020-11-06 22:27:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So, where's our best bet of establishing the new Confederacy?
1324719254307037186 2020-11-06 22:24:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nived56 @ChaserWestbrook The thing is that our primary system in the United States gives people a much larger voice in the way the parties manage themselves. Many of our party offices are subject to election by the public at large too. It’s not like the Tories who are members only club.
1324718917101780995 2020-11-06 22:22:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Lol.
1324718793244004356 2020-11-06 22:22:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChaserWestbrook There will be some professional class people who likely return home or simply abstain from voting in the runoff.
1324718603216822273 2020-11-06 22:21:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nived56 @ChaserWestbrook We can’t let them win.
1324718318738116609 2020-11-06 22:20:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChaserWestbrook If we keep control of the Senate, no way they impose an AWB, though.
1324717684823654401 2020-11-06 22:18:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Media: Yeah, we lied to you for 5 years with our fake news polls, but it’s the law that you have to believe is now. It’s science or something.
1324717388542234624 2020-11-06 22:16:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark Republicans need to frame this as a fight against voter intimidation, which is what it is.
1324716515351035904 2020-11-06 22:13:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @America19722722 I think it might happen naturally if Biden attempts any draconian Covid restrictions.
1324715046858117122 2020-11-06 22:07:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is a good way to put it. “You’re crazy for thinking there’s anything suspicious going on here!”
1324714048898957312 2020-11-06 22:03:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis I just don’t see him delivering.
1324713892057141249 2020-11-06 22:02:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL There are definitely principled professionals who understand what’s up (and why Trump happened in the first place), but it’s just amazing the divide with some of these guys who just don’t understand what we think is at stake.
1324713618819194881 2020-11-06 22:01:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark I believe it. So many votes in our history were obviously rigged.
1324713486518202368 2020-11-06 22:01:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark Did you see the Liberal Aussie Senator who came to investigate how we do elections here conclude there likely never has been a single honest election in our history?
1324711636087787522 2020-11-06 21:54:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PoliticalTake13 @realikamusume Except he didn’t. Biden overperformed. That’s what’s so weird. Trump is going to get the 3.3 million votes we all thought he would. It looks like is going to come up with 3.35 from somewhere when that doesn’t trend with any of the fair count states.
1324710469647716352 2020-11-06 21:49:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @scapeXghost @thehangingchads That’s better, but if we do have it, it needs to be run like Florida’s.
1324709178565365761 2020-11-06 21:44:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @America19722722 I just don’t think that will happen, as much as I think it might be necessary.
1324708118559924224 2020-11-06 21:40:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TrustThePlant These are the same people that told you Russia stole the election.
1324706376044732417 2020-11-06 21:33:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wfdavis_ Yes, that was obviously stolen. I remember it well. However, he was always very moderate to liberal.
1324706138630328320 2020-11-06 21:32:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MarcusShrinking Real patriots. Standing up solely for their class interest and never even engaging the Trump base in the first place.
1324705455780802562 2020-11-06 21:29:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Of course you don’t understand the importance of standing up to China in a Trade War: It might even hurt your pocketbook a little. Who cares what happens to the vast majority of people who have to make things for a living?
1324704857975128064 2020-11-06 21:27:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Every Republican who is accepting of these results does so because they have comfortable professional class sinecures whose remuneration will not be affected by a Biden Admin.
1324700961655431169 2020-11-06 21:11:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AstorAaron @IVMiles An Obama campaign operative was going around *on Twitter* asking people to “fix” their ballots on Wednesday.
1324700130881261569 2020-11-06 21:08:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IVMiles What if Biden systematically harvested mail ins days after the election because he’s a corrupt demented husk of a Democratic machine politician?
1324699866744979457 2020-11-06 21:07:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou It’s ok to hold your cards close to your vest.
1324699759836352512 2020-11-06 21:06:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou This tells me the fight is just getting started.
1324699096410718208 2020-11-06 21:04:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IVMiles These go around ballot harvesting after the election and you think that’s cool. It’s not.
1324697908218896384 2020-11-06 20:59:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Democrats: “We lost the last election and the other guy is a real threat to our power, let’s manufacture scandal and question the election’s legitimacy.”   GOP: “Aw shucks, we lost, it doesn’t really matter anyway. This is all a friendly game.”
1324694853754769408 2020-11-06 20:47:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 1876 Presidential Election.
1324584842957361154 2020-11-06 13:30:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @Wedgetweets DeSantis would appeal to the people who are voting Pence or Trump, Jr.
1324584472801587200 2020-11-06 13:28:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnonTrump66 We’re just a divided people. We either have to come to some kind of arrangement where half the country doesn’t feel their way of life is at stake every election or we have to separate.
1324583679616843776 2020-11-06 13:25:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @turrible_tao He ran on revoking driver’s licenses from illegal aliens and then didn’t do it and even helped expand them. We left California after that happened. Was becoming too obvious.
1324583336006868995 2020-11-06 13:24:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The left: Bringing the country together by going “you lost, hahaha, eat shit, you’ll never win again!”   Real unifying. This totally makes me feel comfortable and want to live in the same country as you.
1324582101648314368 2020-11-06 13:19:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TrustThePlant @ScottMGreer Those errors tend to be egregious and small in number. More systematic box stuffing requires less obvious means. Some of the double counting stuff is a legit mistake and Dem bureaucrats are just more incompetent on average.
1324580407027867648 2020-11-06 13:12:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV Walter Mondale is still alive. He can tell you about getting spanked in the popular vote.
1324579659204485120 2020-11-06 13:09:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 My thoughts: I don’t trust reporters and don’t care about their opinions.
1324578133572505601 2020-11-06 13:03:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TrustThePlant @ScottMGreer Mostly because they find out that the Democrats do crap like count votes twice and have a bunch of random stuffed mail ins lying around.
1324575775866183680 2020-11-06 12:54:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL The parties tend to abuse their mandates too. Like, they’ll get elected on one thing and just do something else. Dems were not elected on Obamacare in 2008. Bush tried to use his 04 mandate for social security reform, which wasn’t even part of the campaign.
1324574628925374465 2020-11-06 12:49:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL That’s one reason why I think if we must have democracy all major decisions need to be done by referendum. People are way too manipulated by people. Issues are clear cut. California voting 25 points right of its Presidential vote on Referenda is proof of that.
1324574182928252929 2020-11-06 12:47:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TrustThePlant @ScottMGreer The reverse tends to happen in states with GOP Governors.
1324573803364683778 2020-11-06 12:46:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL California voters also rejected the Constitutional Amendment to remove the non discrimination clause from their Constitution so Democrats could pass a law making minority representation compulsory by quota.
1324573326312935424 2020-11-06 12:44:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL Dems do a lot of trial balloons in California to see if they’ll get voted down at the ballot box. California voters actually vote way to the right on referendum compared to their other votes. Quite odd.
1324572347463016448 2020-11-06 12:40:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL That got voted down.
1324571343472439299 2020-11-06 12:36:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation @JayFiveK @Maurice20twenty @HeritageNLegacy The weird thing about WI is that literally every county showed increased Trump margins. Just absolutely bonkers turnout in Dane and Milwaukee.
1324570942442491905 2020-11-06 12:34:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation @JayFiveK @Maurice20twenty @HeritageNLegacy Basically what the margins indicate in Michigan at least (and why I don’t think Michigan was stolen, though Wayne obviously stuffed the box) is that every professional “decency” voter that abstained last time voted Biden this time. WI is a bit different.
1324570296226033665 2020-11-06 12:32:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The narrative of the election from the Democrats of this election is basically that everyone in the cities hated Trump so much they turned out like crazy to defeat him. So, sit down, shut up, and accept a return the Obama gig economy because Orange Man Bad.
1324568950760525825 2020-11-06 12:27:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @Maurice20twenty @wasphyxiation @HeritageNLegacy This is all just a narrative the wignats are telling themselves so they can say “I told you so” at the end of the day.
1324568828735606785 2020-11-06 12:26:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @Maurice20twenty @wasphyxiation @HeritageNLegacy Trump got 205K more votes in Wisconsin even *if* he lost. That’s an insane number of votes in Wisconsin. And he got more votes in key working class counties. The places he lost were Dane and Milwaukee: Not strongholds of the WWC.
1324567665164406785 2020-11-06 12:21:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Maurice20twenty @wasphyxiation @HeritageNLegacy @JayFiveK Trump did not lose support among the WWC in the rust belt states every indication from the results is that Trump regressed among the professional class. That’s why this thing is narrow, not WWC. Trump got a lot more of the WWC out everywhere.
1324563884318011392 2020-11-06 12:06:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ori_Ar Noem just won’t win a general. Rubio could, but I’m an immigration hawk and he isn’t. DeSantis: It depends. Having Florida in the bag is nice.
1324563544092954626 2020-11-06 12:05:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Kane9015 They’re desperate to win back the professional class and they don’t realize it’s just lost.
1324562943128883201 2020-11-06 12:03:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheAquaMariner She was at like 10% last time 2024 was polled. Even that’s a meme: She’ll collapse as fast as Harris did from her 18% or wherever. No appeal to actual voters outside South Carolina.
1324562175554428928 2020-11-06 12:00:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I will not entertain the thought that Nikki Haley will ever win the nomination. I didn’t before the election and I won’t now.
1324556439860531200 2020-11-06 11:37:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Sorbetti4 @ChaserWestbrook @RealAPolitics Yeah, I think the margin there is just too big to have been fraud. Doubt Grand Rapids swinging was fraud. Wisconsin, though: Trump got more votes everywhere.
1324553153187090433 2020-11-06 11:24:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Having a different opinion means that you should have your professional life ruined.

They might Republican for Governor or whatever because they want a better state tax policy or whatever, but these are cringe atheists or pseudo-Christians. Not fertile ground.
1324552334010130434 2020-11-06 11:21:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheAquaMariner @realikamusume @NationalistTV Mostly college educated. Flat stupid. No strategic sense in their brain. I hope they enjoy a return to Obama gig economy and severe media repression.
1324551759902199808 2020-11-06 11:18:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @realikamusume @NationalistTV Considering Trump got 80% of Non-College Whites in Georgia, no, the wignat narrative is not right. It’s the professional prog class.
1324551543509704704 2020-11-06 11:17:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @NationalistTV It’s these college socialized morons who bought into this dumb “Trump is dictator” narrative. How do you counteract that level of sheer brainwashing?
1324547529413955587 2020-11-06 11:01:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation The Wisconsin +17 poll was electioneering. Plain and simple.
1324541741228302338 2020-11-06 10:38:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @CityBureaucrat DMV Lady not as good at stuffing the box.

1324531378793418753 2020-11-06 09:57:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Democrats and Establishment Republicans: We need to bring the country together.  Same guys: Trump’s voters should never be allowed to make their case again.
1324515269683875840 2020-11-06 08:53:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Just another reminder that no matter what happens you cannot stop fighting. Seeing a lot of doomer posting like it’s over. I know a lot is at stake, but we need to keep pressing our GOP elected officials regardless of what happens. Good night for now.
1324513156119613441 2020-11-06 08:45:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @modestianrite We can only hope Trump fights this *all the way*. If not, we need to fight to prevent this from becoming permanent throughout the country. Hopefully Senate Republicans know what’s good for them.
1324512295289053185 2020-11-06 08:41:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> GOP will cooperate and that’s the end of honest elections in this country.
1324512185662513153 2020-11-06 08:41:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just don’t think these guys know what’s at stake. Mail in voting has been an excuse by Democrats for years in Oregon and Washington State to go door to door harvesting ballots and make these states uncompetitive when they really should be. They will expand it nationally.
1324511556235894785 2020-11-06 08:38:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis The neocon hacks gonna hack. The annoying ones are the immigration hawks and wignats who were disappointed in Trump’s performance on those issues.
1324510833259565057 2020-11-06 08:36:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> “I think it’s ok for Democrats to use a pandemic and mail in voting to rig an election because I’m a critic of Trump from the right.”  -Lots of people.
1324509259535732736 2020-11-06 08:29:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They just don't want to give us an inch here.
1324508919637676032 2020-11-06 08:28:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> States like Florida and Ohio with long term experience in making voting fair and easy also seem to have very different results from these Dem machine states. And no one was surprised by midnight ballots coming in from nowhere previously unreported.

1324505387601723392 2020-11-06 08:14:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottonTurtle9 It will be just enough I guess.
1324504433326247937 2020-11-06 08:10:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottonTurtle9 I’m pretty sure Chatham and Fulton have been all counted. Not sure if there are any votes left out in Dem strongholds.
1324503392648089601 2020-11-06 08:06:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> What’s left out in Georgia?
1324501878504345600 2020-11-06 08:00:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried @realikamusume I’m hearing the votes aren’t breaking as hard against Trump as they thought they would.
1324499563936468992 2020-11-06 07:51:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf I think he is a bit disappointed in his campaign for letting this get to this point.

1324489710526439424 2020-11-06 07:12:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IVMiles It’s the way people have always behaved throughout human history.
1324489349468102657 2020-11-06 07:10:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark They’ve just been re-elected on Trump voters and a lot of those voters would never vote for them otherwise.
1324484395647016968 2020-11-06 06:51:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnonTrump66 That seemed to be what happened in PA in particular. Trump’s campaign thought they’d get 2.6 million votes on EDay to 1.5 million for Biden. The break is even bigger than that. Trump got like 2.8 million votes and Biden got 1.3 or so. Suddenly all these mail ins appear.
1324479812426211328 2020-11-06 06:32:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL @thehangingchads Shocking that Broward was more Republican this year. Just absolutely shocking.
1324477976956862464 2020-11-06 06:25:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL @thehangingchads That’s what Florida does and no one at this point doubts the authenticity of Florida results.
1324476730791337985 2020-11-06 06:20:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> How come post Election Day votes favor Democrats literally everywhere? You’d think randomness would dictate they sometimes favor Republicans. This isn’t just this bizarro quasi-election either: It’s been going on for years.
1324475089744781314 2020-11-06 06:14:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DanCrenshawTX @KaitMarieox You suck.
1324472496930914306 2020-11-06 06:03:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @saveusculture @JayFiveK Those Hispanic Anti-Coms in Miami are a big ally too.
1324469898651815938 2020-11-06 05:53:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @KpopCatboy @realikamusume There's already rerun precedent. And it's simply the law that the State Legislatures have plenary power over Electors.
1324469037485752321 2020-11-06 05:50:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This 👇  We must stand together.
1324466911648882691 2020-11-06 05:41:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Left: Trump is a divider, you shouldn't treat your political enemies like they're the enemy.  Also the Left: I can't wait until we surreptitiously steal this election and prosecute Trump and his entire family for political reasons.
1324466477903286274 2020-11-06 05:39:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Trump just needs some allies and to fight all the way.
1324466305651613697 2020-11-06 05:39:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL @IrishLarper I'm a fan as well.
1324463475054252034 2020-11-06 05:27:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot How close the Nevada total's are to RAP's projection is, quite frankly, scary.
1324462785024167937 2020-11-06 05:25:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> My Traditionalist half of me says just use state legislatures as the Constitution demands. My pragmatic half says the only way everyone will feel this is fair is if we rerun this thing nationally with a ton of observers everywhere.
1324461827452002305 2020-11-06 05:21:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 We're not going to take it back, but GOP has gained at least 10 seats and possibly more.
1324459665644728320 2020-11-06 05:12:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SaveWhitesInZA @akattorney @RealAPolitics Yeah, because they're printing ballots.
1324459239339864067 2020-11-06 05:11:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @CitadelMark Now is the time to keep our cards close to our chest.
1324458900561760257 2020-11-06 05:09:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> When I say "voted early" I mean early on EDay of course.
1324458763517046784 2020-11-06 05:09:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm inferring this from how Florida's turnout went over the course of the day and my personal witnessing of what happened in Fairfax County.
1324458571296366598 2020-11-06 05:08:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> OK, so here is one way they were able to go crazy with the fraud: Republicans bucked their trend of voting very late in the day (typically after work) and instead were so excited for the Prez, they voted early. This gave Dems the whole day to know how many ballots to print.
1324457614412029954 2020-11-06 05:04:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SaveWhitesInZA @RealAPolitics That doesn't really say much.
1324455930793201665 2020-11-06 04:57:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Turnout in Fairfax hadn't matched 2016 number as of 5 PM Election Night. Suddenly, they have tens of thousands more.
1324454431145033729 2020-11-06 04:51:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeerXcutioner Republicans are naturally more conservative personalities. I support keeping our cards close to our vests at this point.
1324452906205126658 2020-11-06 04:45:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Before we start dooming about Republican turncoats, please disregard all media reports about them. The public statements of Republicans all indicate they are in support of the President. I don't fully trust a lot of these guys either, but media hacks gonna hack.
1324452554772750341 2020-11-06 04:44:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright 👀
1324450447357333504 2020-11-06 04:36:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Th0mist @RealAPolitics As a percent of total pop it is. Very unusual to see that kind of increase when we didn't see it almost anywhere else.
1324445960630579202 2020-11-06 04:18:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot A lot are from Savannah, though.
1324444603148357633 2020-11-06 04:12:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Filmerian1 @CitadelMark I think I might turn on his show tonight in spite of what I just said. Heard he has an expose going on.
1324444175077695489 2020-11-06 04:11:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @detroitotaku Printed ballots in Philly. No joke. Before the 1940s, Philly was run by a Republican machine. Used to pull the same tricks the Dems do there now. It rarely impacted the results, though, because Republicans were so dominant nationally between 1860 and 1928.
1324443763150901249 2020-11-06 04:09:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Filmerian1 @CitadelMark Hearing reports from multiple people they're never turning it on again. Only debate is if Tucker's an exception or not. Personally, I ain't even turning it on for Tucker.
1324441613846892546 2020-11-06 04:01:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf @realikamusume I’m a perennial one. We can’t let them win in the end.
1324441296812052482 2020-11-06 03:59:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf @realikamusume I tend to agree. I’m just saying it is possible.
1324440608774250497 2020-11-06 03:57:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf @realikamusume If we can secure a fair midterm in the rust belt, populist GOP Governors will take office in the rust belt and ensure free and fair elections in 2024.
1324440348563775489 2020-11-06 03:56:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf @realikamusume That's my concern, but we have made a lot of gains in the rest of government. We can systematically demand free and fair elections in all these states.
1324439471832616960 2020-11-06 03:52:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I'm thinking about it and this might be the best play. Maybe it's cope, but we can spend the next 4 years purging disloyalists in the GOP and building this coalition to simply overwhelm them in 2024. Take huge majorities in the House and Senate after redistricting.
1324438613673811969 2020-11-06 03:49:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LibertarianGC Truman won that legit.
1324436971490549763 2020-11-06 03:42:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Nixon, Cleveland, and Jackson obviously had shenanigans played against them.
1324435791553191937 2020-11-06 03:37:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Lefties are out in force to discourage you and reinforce the mass disenfranchisement that is occurring.
1324434486210289664 2020-11-06 03:32:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 @SelbJim Just saying it probably was true in PA too, but it's being hidden.
1324433879952957443 2020-11-06 03:30:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 @SelbJim The precinct level data backs it up in most of the country.
1324433395284353024 2020-11-06 03:28:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 I'm actually beginning to believe they likely stole PA and WI from Bush in 2004, but being a typical GOP insider, Bush didn't care and he already won.
1324432933218930688 2020-11-06 03:26:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot These patterns are NOT repeated anywhere else in the rust belt but the states in dispute.
1324432517613690882 2020-11-06 03:24:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 Shockingly enough...Bush margins. This is basically the 2004 election with mass voter fraud and Virginia off the table.
1324431756137766918 2020-11-06 03:21:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump did better with Blacks everywhere....except Pennsylvania, where Blacks are usually more disloyal than average (they voted for Bush at higher margins).
1324431192876322816 2020-11-06 03:19:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pjg0014 @EricTrump This is the third Presidential election you have attempted to steal in 60 years. Screw off.
1324430735751712781 2020-11-06 03:17:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot The moms came home, the dads went away, very weird.
1324430632810938370 2020-11-06 03:17:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot It's apparently suburban....dads who turned against Trump. Utterly bizarre.
1324429548985978886 2020-11-06 03:13:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just wonder what this election would like if the polls had been honestly. Certainly there were some people discouraged by constant "Biden+10, everyone has become a prog" polls from voting.
1324428725556051968 2020-11-06 03:09:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Checkmate on fraud, libtards.
1324426920600215556 2020-11-06 03:02:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ded_ruckus It is possible in PA because most of the “mail ins” that are being found weren’t proper requests: They were printed at home and sent in. That’s why Lancaster has more mail ins than requests. If you can trace them all to small set of printers, that’s beyond reasonable doubt.
1324426306394742786 2020-11-06 03:00:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If Trump does go full scorched earth and invokes the state legislative option, he needs to use his office to expose everything.
1324426026118750210 2020-11-06 02:59:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @QuasLacrimas It’s literally just one of several coincidences that don’t add up when taken en Toto.
1324423773005774848 2020-11-06 02:50:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @EricTrump Eric, encourage your father to fight this all the way. The integrity and legitimacy of government is at stake.
1324423418033426434 2020-11-06 02:48:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark FNC has lost million of loyal viewers since Tuesday.
1324417309960740865 2020-11-06 02:24:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jefft2003 @SlugFuz3 @RealAPolitics Pinal is too.
1324416276396232705 2020-11-06 02:20:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart @NationalistTV India counts 800 million votes in a day. Think about how many that is.
1324415628288184320 2020-11-06 02:17:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV At this point, this is an insult to third world countries. It's worse.
1324414212983214080 2020-11-06 02:12:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Nomos_Forever @SelimSeesYou @KingBroly I'm for literally whatever it takes. You read that correctly.
1324413672983285761 2020-11-06 02:10:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Just literally LM. 10K NeverTrumpers I believe. 105K vote Biden and not Democrat? LMAO.
1324413365066829825 2020-11-06 02:08:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law Trump won WI between 50 and 100K. Can't convince me otherwise at this point.
1324413061101461504 2020-11-06 02:07:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanSHensler @NoahPisardin @Wizard_Predicts @RemindMe_OfThis 5 of them are fake. Just like last time.
1324412510754213888 2020-11-06 02:05:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanSHensler @NoahPisardin @Wizard_Predicts Oh, looks like we control the state legislatures in a deciding number of states.
1324409164756561920 2020-11-06 01:52:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is international. People throughout the world know the Democrats are trying to steal this from Trump and some of them are in on it. Some know it’s the biggest BS they’ve ever seen.
1324407596271489025 2020-11-06 01:45:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’ve seen elections flip in the Wild West over a few thousand votes that flow in after EDay that were sus. Hundreds of thousands? Never before dreamed possible.
1324406179347529731 2020-11-06 01:40:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OrthoStruggle @CitadelMark I think the Hispanic Trump voters are freaking scared of a communist takeover and are willing to go full Pinochet. Who knows how many Whites follow?
1324405366051012610 2020-11-06 01:37:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OrthoStruggle @CitadelMark It’s really up to Trump. He has a very loyal following.
1324404579551879168 2020-11-06 01:33:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @realikamusume Yeah, what's up with this, Trump won and we need to keep the energy up.
1324402738558603264 2020-11-06 01:26:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SPLAT07220386 No. I've been sus of them, but it might be my our only option. Will create one tonight.
1324402022523805697 2020-11-06 01:23:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We're being shown up by third worlders with shit in the streets.
1324401666632916993 2020-11-06 01:22:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I need to create another outlet before they ban us all from here.
1324401493592727558 2020-11-06 01:21:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Look, guys, you *cannot* accept the legitimacy of the election at this point. We’ve been lied to for months and now they’re doing everything they can to continue the lie.
1324398456795025408 2020-11-06 01:09:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark I had been tracking the early vote the country and my suspected margins ended up right in the vast majority of the country *except* these three rust belt states.
1324397636846309380 2020-11-06 01:06:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @KingBroly Have faith we will restore integrity in this process.
1324394185013764098 2020-11-06 00:52:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Thank you, Senate Republicans.
1324394073470455812 2020-11-06 00:52:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The US is a country that sends "election observers" to all over the world, but they won't let Republicans watch votes in Dem Machine counties.
1324392313804738563 2020-11-06 00:45:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark Penn is in the hall of shame too as they print ballots.
1324389558834892802 2020-11-06 00:34:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @monk_cryptic No, typical Black county ballot stuffing.
1324389408041291782 2020-11-06 00:33:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Daily post-election reminder that the polls were fake for months and this was always a close race. Closer than we all wanted, but it was never going to be a Biden 8 point landslide.
1324389217250717697 2020-11-06 00:32:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee It would have been a deadlock pre-election, but Trump flipped Iowa.
1324388974312521728 2020-11-06 00:31:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @monk_cryptic Savannah is getting in on the action, actually.
1324388114379481089 2020-11-06 00:28:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CowboyTfup420 @LongCole After all the blue Texas memes, Dems flipped like one county and I think lost a lot of Hispanic ones.
1324387692646453250 2020-11-06 00:26:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Retardius2 @thehangingchads Trump is actually doing better than our models predicted in some states.
1324387472613216258 2020-11-06 00:25:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation I love Indians.
1324384584189022211 2020-11-06 00:14:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Like, we even called how close Nevada would be, despite Dems assuming that was safe. RAP's model basically exactly matches the vote total there.
1324384235579494401 2020-11-06 00:13:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads It's amazing how the number of GOP votes basically match our models to a T, but the number of Dem ballots jump up in some key states.
1324383044858531849 2020-11-06 00:08:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ori_Ar @realikamusume If that's the case, Trump won those votes.
1324382954127298560 2020-11-06 00:07:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Republicans: Win everywhere, but mysteriously ballots show up to go just beyond recount margins in like 5 swing states 2 days after the election. Not sus at all.
1324382399271194626 2020-11-06 00:05:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan She'd need cabinet approval and the approval of two-thirds of both houses of Congress.
1324382075730956288 2020-11-06 00:04:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan I doubt it. McCarthy indicated his support for Trump and they literally all just reelected or elected on Trump votes.
1324381878942654465 2020-11-06 00:03:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Sorry, but, technically speaking, this is the most 2020 result.
1324381654832525319 2020-11-06 00:02:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DocKilmer @realikamusume That why it doesn't make sense. Like, I just don't see Trump regressing among men that much.
1324380681665957889 2020-11-05 23:58:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed They seem to have gotten pretty good at this since 2000. Those results come in fast and basically no one doubts the results, especially after the 2018 cleanup of Broward (which, suspiciously, is now more Republican than it usually is).
1324380253716946946 2020-11-05 23:57:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I'm really hoping those rest of state ballots were dropped off on EDay. Those should be disproportioantely GOP or Indie ballots. Otherwise, the current break is looking like 50K votes for Biden.
1324379163315347456 2020-11-05 23:52:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jaden_nixon @realikamusume Yes. State Senate leader is already saying the results as sus too.
1324378849099087873 2020-11-05 23:51:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation @Ori_Ar @KevinAldrich2 The good news is we're already finding thousands of out of staters and dead people voting across the rust belt and all these results are incredibly close.
1324376797040041985 2020-11-05 23:43:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ori_Ar @wasphyxiation @KevinAldrich2 Penn GOP State Senate leader is already casting doubt on the legitimacy of the election results.
1324376639816519687 2020-11-05 23:42:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Tells you just how massive the fraud could be. That’s like 10% of the votes in a typical House race.
1324376288275124224 2020-11-05 23:41:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation @KevinAldrich2 Technically the courts don’t have to do it, the state legislatures can act on their own, but it would add an air of legitimacy to the process.
1324376063053615106 2020-11-05 23:40:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation This is long standing tradition: Philly busses voters from Camden New Jersey over to pad the ballot box. They actually did it for Republicans way back like 70+ years ago.
1324375753081966593 2020-11-05 23:39:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Anyone else remember the time Connor Lamb tried to get 30K votes counted in his district when the voters weren’t even from there?
1324375412781293568 2020-11-05 23:37:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Of course, now they’re going to “rebuild” the Republican Party as the party of losers again.
1324375027450523649 2020-11-05 23:36:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 It’s never been done for a Presidential race.
1324374932009209856 2020-11-05 23:36:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim Trump got more EDay votes than his campaign expected and they’re supposedly losing. LMAO.
1324374297494913030 2020-11-05 23:33:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theeternalright @OfficialDavidNC The news so far is they found 10K out of staters voting in PA already. Most likely Camden voters heading to Philly.
1324374105999745025 2020-11-05 23:32:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> An Election Board ordered a new election in 2019 over 500 bundled ballots in North Carolina. 10K out of staters is well more than enough to call for a new election in PA.
1324373291801432069 2020-11-05 23:29:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NHmortal @Ecsullie @BoggJoe @SelbJim @Peoples_Pundit @realDonaldTrump Seriously. Trump probably won PA by tens of thousands more votes than he did. Hillary’s team wasn’t fully prepared for the scale of fraud they’d need to conduct. They thought a stuffed ballot box here and there would do it. This is much bigger.
1324372190863724544 2020-11-05 23:25:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Unity isn’t always worth the price.
1324370393046679552 2020-11-05 23:18:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 10,000 people who don't live in PA voted there. Probably voted in New Jersey too.
1324368967012634624 2020-11-05 23:12:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lady_Astor This is what it seems like.
1324368515000918016 2020-11-05 23:10:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Apparently, there were a bunch of families where the wife voted for Trump and the husband for Biden. That ruins quite a lot of narratives lmao.
1324368339058200577 2020-11-05 23:09:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These are actually some really good numbers for Republicans....except among married men?   Something doesn't add up here.
1324365641160269830 2020-11-05 22:59:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> As suspected, this crap is going on everywhere.
1324363083544932356 2020-11-05 22:48:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "Election Fraud doesn't happen."
1324362781668397058 2020-11-05 22:47:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume They've done literally everything. It's crazy.
1324362565862985734 2020-11-05 22:46:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Nuclear option afoot.... *prays*
1324362398933880833 2020-11-05 22:46:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I wonder how many gun voters stayed home because of the ATF's pistol brace antics the past three weeks. These guys pulls out all the stops.
1324359645042003968 2020-11-05 22:35:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> And this in a state that doesn't ordinarily do mail ins, so it's not like Florida where they're incredibly efficient with it (still, a great return rate on mail in Florida is 85%).
1324359471422935042 2020-11-05 22:34:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There were 3.1 million requests in Pennsylvania. No in person voting *at all* and they suddenly scrounge up 400K extra votes after EDay, giving them an unbelievable 95% return rate.
1324358773620826112 2020-11-05 22:31:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @altamontcarl @realikamusume The electors are appointed by the votes. So, without the votes tallied, the state legislatures have to appoint them.
1324358583354593282 2020-11-05 22:31:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NycPilgram @realikamusume He did during the Obama Admin. I don't understand people's problem with cocaine Mitch. He has delivered pretty consistently.
1324356046014566402 2020-11-05 22:21:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan I'm beginning to think it's systematic. Demographically, these people shouldn't vote this far apart from each other. You can claim a small gap in Wayne is some organizing, but this much? Crazy talk.
1324355495537332225 2020-11-05 22:18:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All I'm going to say is that there wasn't a big difference between the way people voted by mail in Michigan and Ohio and one of those showed huge Trump lead and the other mysteriously finds tens, nay, hundreds of thousands of mail in ballots for Biden all over the place.
1324354178664325120 2020-11-05 22:13:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Republicans: Record turnout across the country.   Democrat response:  https://t.co/JLcEe4z7Xl
1324350864392413184 2020-11-05 22:00:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim Trump won indies in Florida.
1324349825517760514 2020-11-05 21:56:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is a sham.
1324348309784481793 2020-11-05 21:50:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou What tells you there is *massive* fraud is Republicans are making gains everywhere and then you hit these big cities and suddenly there’s massive turnout increase all for Democrats.
1324210701385289728 2020-11-05 12:43:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep It really depends on if their base demands it and there’s enough reason to do it. Their base is terrified of a Biden/Harris Admin and very few of them have any reason to listen to anyone else.
1324209848058290176 2020-11-05 12:40:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’d find it hilariously ironic if Trump ends up going nuclear with the state legislature option. Constitutional Republicanism restored through fire.
1324209296024940544 2020-11-05 12:37:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep If we ever did see it, it would be this year. The GOP throughout the country has been retained in their office on Trump votes. They have a symbiotic relationship now.
1324207099623124993 2020-11-05 12:29:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp They’re already having difficulty controlling people and GOP Govs won’t give two shits about it.
1324206786522611714 2020-11-05 12:27:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Florida saw a high turnout election. It didn’t see 95% Democrats return their ballots. There weren’t websites where you could just print a ballot. Oh, and look, Trump won big.
1324204223899312132 2020-11-05 12:17:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @Anton56422519 I agree. Definitely need to figure out how to clamp down on the gig economy.
1324201513166786561 2020-11-05 12:06:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @Anton56422519 California’s law was total overreach that also affected stuff like having to give your wedding musician a W2 at the end of the year. Was really bizarre. Needs to be redrawn to not be ridiculous like that.
1324198857006305287 2020-11-05 11:56:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Anton56422519 It’s funny how the more “educated” voters vote more on socialization and aesthetics than on issues.
1324197401880657931 2020-11-05 11:50:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Anton56422519 The personality was a factor in 2016, though.
1324197240504811521 2020-11-05 11:49:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @andrewboonedog That’s what I’m saying: Trump improved his margins in every demographic group except professional males and *potentially* some White working class men. Not particularly clear he did that as those precincts are still very Trump.
1324195940610281472 2020-11-05 11:44:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just find it hilarious that after all of the polls showing Trump collapsing among White women while holding among men, the only reason this race is close and not an absolute Trumpslide is major regression among White college men. I honestly think they’re jealous.
1324195419891605504 2020-11-05 11:42:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed You are actually correct.
1324195068723580928 2020-11-05 11:41:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Of course, this is exit polls, so grain of salt.
1324194999735668739 2020-11-05 11:41:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> White women were 2 points more for Trump and, contra wignat and popnat narrative, basically the only group that regressed at all in support for Trump was professional men. Any White Working class male regression was tiny and made up for by women.
1324193435465764866 2020-11-05 11:34:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @wasphyxiation Senate actually met in secret for many years because they would spend the time discussing executive matters.
1324193301889798144 2020-11-05 11:34:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @wasphyxiation It seems like a good idea on paper. “Let the loser feel like he has a seat at the table.”  Originally the role in the Senate was thought to bigger as they thought there’d be a lot of ties and the Senate was supposed to play a more proactive role in advising the executive.
1324191728216264706 2020-11-05 11:28:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation “Well, that was a mistake, wasn’t it.”
1324191613606912000 2020-11-05 11:27:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation I mean, at least pay someone to do it.  This was also the original intent of the Constitution. It took exactly one contentious election to get thrown out as a bad idea.
1324190459640631296 2020-11-05 11:23:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NewEra_05 @ColumbiaBugle Yeah. The House and Senate races look *exactly* like a narrow Trump win. Extremely coincidental that.
1324190028873015296 2020-11-05 11:21:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Mail in voting is the least secure form of voting on every level. When you have to have a reason and you have to request it, it’s not a problem, but just mass mailing ballots is a recipe for fraud.
1324189779270029316 2020-11-05 11:20:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is actually what’s going on in a lot of these places. A lot of protest voters intentionally spoil their ballots. Right now Democrats are giving them the opportunity to “fix” them to “have their voices heard.” Nah: They’re going to harass you until you give them a Biden vote.
1324189178205265925 2020-11-05 11:17:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NewEra_05 @ColumbiaBugle Republicans have screwed the pooch on healthcare for sure.
1324189025255776259 2020-11-05 11:17:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> One reason mail in ballots suck is they are a source of potential voter intimidation. It’s easier to agitate voters into giving you a ballot they don’t really want to when they already have it. Harder to get them to actually go to the polls.
1324187297529679874 2020-11-05 11:10:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NewEra_05 @ColumbiaBugle We just can’t keep surrendering on every issue over and over again. It’s clear we have enough people out there to fight them to a draw at every opportunity. We can’t just be the side that sits down and takes it after 4 years of relentless media assault. They’ll always win.
1324186118259122176 2020-11-05 11:05:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Like, we have convinced a lot of people of the need for restrictionist immigration reform, better trade deals, tax policies that help Middle American families instead of blue state professionals. And now they’re just printing ballots because we must defeat the Bad Orange Man.
1324185618348494849 2020-11-05 11:03:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’ve supported Trump literally since the escalator. As a human being with different opinions, I’ve not always agreed with everything he has done, but the way we’ve been maligned ever since for fighting for Middle American values and their prosperity is quite something...
1324184966062874624 2020-11-05 11:01:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ColumbiaBugle Typical cuckservatives. This is a difficult time for us who have been on the Trump Train since June 16, 2015. Like, we’ve accomplished so much and they’re just trying to take it through the most underhanded ways possible.
1324184449731481600 2020-11-05 10:59:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 That they’ll fight to the bitter end and they legit believe this is being stolen.
1324183941276966919 2020-11-05 10:57:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just hope Trump’s fundraising emails are serious.
1324183690604400646 2020-11-05 10:56:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LatrineJames Yeah. Like, one side or the other surrenders. My main point is it’s better to go for another round than surrender this. This election is at best a split decision. Biden will have no mandate to get anything done.
1324183326052261889 2020-11-05 10:54:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SylvanRed @SelimSeesYou The part of California he represents looks more like the South or Midwest than the rest of California.
1324182384305147906 2020-11-05 10:50:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ToshJann They do. I don’t know how far they’re willing to go. I hope all the way.
1324182276654157829 2020-11-05 10:50:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LatrineJames Getting them to even agree to a divorce is a fight in and of itself. If that’s what we need to do, we need to fight for it.
1324181268972654592 2020-11-05 10:46:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It’s not cope to pick yourself up and go for another round.
1324181086449115137 2020-11-05 10:45:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Guys, if they do steal this election and we are not vindicated you *must* continue fighting for the cause. They’ve spent 4 years preparing for this, even trying to avert through other means, and the fact they’re having to do what they’re doing now is an accomplishment.
1324180236951560195 2020-11-05 10:42:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cheetodorito69 They’ve ruined elections in the states of Washington and Oregon. Those states were purple or at least competitive until they went all or default mail in and now they’re solid blue. Seattle just prints however many ballots they need.
1324178545774571521 2020-11-05 10:35:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 Biden would have already set the precedent.
1324178180643688449 2020-11-05 10:34:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JonMeyersSF I agree, but if Trump doesn’t figure out a way to stop this steal, I’d back him for a third run.
1324177692061818880 2020-11-05 10:32:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cheetodorito69 Nixon had it rigged against him in 1960 and he won a squeaker in 1968.
1324177238707867653 2020-11-05 10:30:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon So am I, but we should retain the Senate and prevent court packing, thus allowing our 6-3 majority to deliver them some blows.
1324176912344846337 2020-11-05 10:29:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiah_crawley Oh, it will go. Especially because we retained control of the redistricting process. Senate might flip: Would have to run a strong race in Illinois to potentially gain many seats.
1324176642294632453 2020-11-05 10:28:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JonMeyersSF Trumpism isn’t as far from the traditional conservatism of the average Republican voter as people think. Like, it’s a bit more gung Ho on some stuff, but Duncan Hunter and Tom Tancredo were conservative stalwarts in Congress with the same platform as Trump.
1324176304871268361 2020-11-05 10:26:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MatthewRafeedi1 I’m down with it if he goes for it. I just think Pence 2024 is a GE lock.
1324176097576161282 2020-11-05 10:25:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BradsNews I will never cast a vote for Marco Rubio and neither should you.
1324176024830119937 2020-11-05 10:25:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy I’ve been thinking about 2024 since 2016.
1324175885747060736 2020-11-05 10:25:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Part of this is I’m convinced if Biden/Harris do take office, it will be an incredibly unpopular Admin. Immediate 48% disapproval at least (ignore fake polls showing he has like 75% support or whatever).
1324175395915288582 2020-11-05 10:23:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m actually going back and forth between Trump and Pence 2024. I think Pence running on Trumpism would be damn near unbeatable. Some hardcore Trumpists don’t trust him, but it seems like the best choice politically unless we want to burn it all down and maybe that’s the move.
1324174444441587712 2020-11-05 10:19:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> True.
1324174174890479617 2020-11-05 10:18:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @yeahitscasual If it’s EDAY it will come through.
1324174077645541376 2020-11-05 10:17:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiah_crawley @Data_Orbital Even if Biden won Arizona, the margins will continue to narrow.
1324173986570317834 2020-11-05 10:17:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiah_crawley @Data_Orbital Yeah, lots of EDAY vote in a lot of these places.

1324171971358326785 2020-11-05 10:09:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Sorry for doomer posting.
1324171837778132993 2020-11-05 10:09:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LVB_19 Ok. So I thought the vote total seemed low. We have more EDAY votes?
1324171613902938113 2020-11-05 10:08:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis I think I might have missed something.
1324171489571180544 2020-11-05 10:07:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I keep seeing people saying it was good. What am I missing?
1324171222930853889 2020-11-05 10:06:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Well, doesn’t look good in Arizona.
1324169786331439107 2020-11-05 10:00:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MaritimeLoyal @BrianSh86084519 BS
1324169377286103041 2020-11-05 09:59:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> About ready to get the Maricopa County dump. Hopefully it’s good.
1324169248026054656 2020-11-05 09:58:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Does anyone on earth know how many mail ins are outstanding in PA? Like, I didn’t see this election going above 6.5 million based on trends, those seem to work everywhere but all these states sitting out.
1324167670200258567 2020-11-05 09:52:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StaresInStoic They’re lazy and told people how many votes they needed in that by the hundreds/thousands.
1324129539090468865 2020-11-05 07:20:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If we’re going to be this divided, we need to do the purple finger after you voted.
1324127243350716417 2020-11-05 07:11:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou This dude spent his campaign calling basically half the country “chumps.”
1324124205189898241 2020-11-05 06:59:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Conservatives who defend this type of legal gamesmanship really get to me. Like, there’s no way Biden wins a free and fair election.
1324123933612904448 2020-11-05 06:58:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer Just flat out doing in front of our faces.

1324122749158248452 2020-11-05 06:53:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Just to reiterate the point: Either the pollsters that showed a tight race were wrong and got lucky with turnout on Election Day or most of them MSM has been rigging polls for basically the entire Trump era.
1324121311770300418 2020-11-05 06:48:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Dadetalian Most of them will be Republicans and we will end up even more polarized potentially.
1324120979753312263 2020-11-05 06:46:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiah_crawley That’s one reason I say it.
1324120276267945985 2020-11-05 06:44:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If Biden wins and ends up attempting to institute a national lockdown over corona, expect a mass migration of people to red states/purple states that will resist.
1324118148006772741 2020-11-05 06:35:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Literally printing ballots. Sounds totally legit.
1324117117344616452 2020-11-05 06:31:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @Dadetalian Not really, but I’m going to meme.
1324116341759070208 2020-11-05 06:28:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @Dadetalian We controlled their legislatures.
1324114482399006721 2020-11-05 06:21:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tempustempus Trump's team was rumored to be gaming this scenario for months.
1324114148305866753 2020-11-05 06:19:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 Not yet. Let them think they've won some more.
1324114062553288706 2020-11-05 06:19:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Moreover, they don't just control them, they retained control. There's literally nothing that can be done about this constitutionally if the Republicans are united in their belief the election was stolen.
1324113845632290817 2020-11-05 06:18:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BorealReinhard @ByzCat Bush v. Gore.
1324113648177029120 2020-11-05 06:17:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The GOP controls the state legislatures in all of the relevant states besides Nevada: Both Houses. Per Bush v. Gore, they have plenary power *without gubernatorial interference* to award electors.
1324112758326087687 2020-11-05 06:14:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Have the Democrats picked up any House seats? Looks like they might pull off CA-25.
1324111211991105548 2020-11-05 06:08:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is a postmortem gift from Based Rehnquist, btw.
1324111125055680512 2020-11-05 06:07:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 Better yet: They all just reelected on big Trump vote.
1324111055874936832 2020-11-05 06:07:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago Bush v. Gore.
1324111004456931330 2020-11-05 06:07:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 @AStratelates Based Rehnquist.
1324110714613780483 2020-11-05 06:06:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates Yes.
1324110467866988544 2020-11-05 06:05:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If the Dems can try to scheme their PV pact stuff. We can scheme the constitutional method back.
1324110162030923776 2020-11-05 06:03:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump's going to go nuclear and get the state legislatures to award their electors to him. I like it. Constitutional checkmate.
1324108972765466625 2020-11-05 05:59:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> As of yesterday morning the number of returned mail ins was: 2,506,557.
1324108316168101888 2020-11-05 05:56:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trutsle @TiddieChvmper2 This is totally normal.
1324107251536302080 2020-11-05 05:52:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The polls said half the PA pop would vote by mail, break 75-25 for Biden, but if all the votes are counted end up at like 6.5 million as they are claiming, this is well outside the margin of error even if every requested mail ballot was returned.
1324106729903300609 2020-11-05 05:50:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiah_crawley I agree with the strategy.
1324106652078014468 2020-11-05 05:50:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BorealReinhard I saw a clip from the presser. He was saying we're going to find out every dead person, Camden resident, etc. who voted in Philadelphia.
1324105915608477701 2020-11-05 05:47:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Giuliani is really going hard. I hope this pans out. I'd really love for the American political machine to really be outed for their corrupt games.
1324105204632035328 2020-11-05 05:44:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation Are they doing it on purpose to humiliate us? Seems like it.
1324104393445310469 2020-11-05 05:41:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law Decision Desk thinks a max of 14% of the vote is out.
1324102501562490880 2020-11-05 05:33:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark BTW, the last two guys that did unseat a President this narrowly (Benjamin Harrison and Jimmy Carter) went on to be defeated in their reelection.
1324101989219926018 2020-11-05 05:31:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheEorlkonig @SelimSeesYou It's normal for the SOS to be behind.
1324101770671464448 2020-11-05 05:30:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark Is he trying to claim some kind of mandate because he narrowly clung onto a few states at best?
1324101457063411714 2020-11-05 05:29:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Michigan is beyond recount. Wisconsin: There's something fishy going on there.
1324098689930022923 2020-11-05 05:18:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Seriously, I didn't even think the number of votes *Trump* got in Wisconsin was possible. Like, that shit's crazy.
1324098367006396421 2020-11-05 05:17:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Did Trump really win a huge landslide in Wisconsin only to have it stolen by stuffed ballot boxes in Dane and Milwaukee? This seems likely given voter turnout there.
1324097128969441285 2020-11-05 05:12:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnnCoulter Exit polls suck Ann.
1324096897037066240 2020-11-05 05:11:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Even California has had enough of the wokeness it appears. I'm sensing GOP rebound there in the midterms if Trump loses.
1324095730039066624 2020-11-05 05:06:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cera_larry It's going to be a bitter slog in AZ whoever wins. Most of the vote out is EDay. Rumor is that the Maricopa recorder found some batch of mail ins he didn't tell us about.
1324095047344730113 2020-11-05 05:03:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Sounds like Nevada not looking good for Trump. Penn is given their continued delay of the vote count. Arizona is forcing Maricopa's hand, but they delayed ALAP too.
1324094372166705152 2020-11-05 05:01:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> And by this, I don't mean just not repealing some of our policies, I just mean they want to ruin you *personally* over this. No one on the right wanted to ruin people personally because they voted for Obama in 08: We all understood the mood of the country was against us.
1324094050237112321 2020-11-05 04:59:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Please don't misinterpret me: I'd be far more accepting of defeat if they hadn't been promising retribution for the past 4 years. Like, there has to be give and take here if we don't want contentious elections.
1324090254626902022 2020-11-05 04:44:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 It's a tough ask. But 40 wouldn't have been crazy given his crazy improvements with minorities.
1324089695249309696 2020-11-05 04:42:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 I did. They were forced to retract it, though. Keep your powder dry.
1324089544367624192 2020-11-05 04:42:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 They pulled out literally everything, including the weaponization of a disease.
1324089477430693888 2020-11-05 04:41:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 Unbiased media it might have been bigger than that. I honestly believe it. Even the typical slight Democrat spin would have been massive.
1324088997665275905 2020-11-05 04:39:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The fact Trump even fought this to a draw is a feat politically. These people should be scared. The repression will only get more fierce from here.
1324088450027560960 2020-11-05 04:37:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I have literally no doubt in my mind that if every vote was cast on Election Day without fake news corona scare tactics, Donald Trump would have won a huge mandate.
1324088155239309312 2020-11-05 04:36:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law Especially when the early vote actually looked depressed there and there were zero reports of long lines in urbans.
1324087911348903940 2020-11-05 04:35:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob Because if they lose, it's fraud at this point.
1324087387463520257 2020-11-05 04:33:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I told you over 90% mail in returns would be suspicious and that's what Biden's team is looking for in PA.
1324083876801765376 2020-11-05 04:19:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Switching sides against the left. It can be done. We just need to keep pressing. Press. Press. Press some more. Even if Trump loses, the Harris Admin will be an unpopular nightmare and he should run again.
1324082571026796552 2020-11-05 04:14:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I do think we are a divided nation, but we’re not quite as divided as I thought going into this election. Trump’s vote totals are up almost across the board. Even in blue states. I think switching can occur and this election might set the stage given the staggering failure.
1324078948435824640 2020-11-05 03:59:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation And by that: If the results are suspect in enough states to decide the election (and it’s more than one or two), Trump (or Biden) could force a Constitutional Crisis over it.
1324078613956800528 2020-11-05 03:58:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation Most likely the state legislature as there isn’t time unless we do it nationwide.
1324077913529077767 2020-11-05 03:55:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation The Michigan 2016 recount provides a path: If there are discrepancies in the voter rolls and number of votes, could invalidate the election results totally. Between Dane and Milwaukee, they might have stuffed the box that much.
1324076615890952195 2020-11-05 03:50:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaleoEconomist This is pretty normal.
1324072593566113792 2020-11-05 03:34:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Funny how the only way Biden wins PA at this point is if there was a polling error in the City of Philadelphia.
1324072270730506240 2020-11-05 03:33:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Unions screwing their own members for their Democrat paymasters.
1324072099380645889 2020-11-05 03:32:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Folks, this is happening. We're going to court. Holy shit.
1324071695297269760 2020-11-05 03:31:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @CarlStein1984 I'm down.
1324071558080565252 2020-11-05 03:30:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 As if Democrats haven't done this before. The only race the Republicans *probably* stole in our history was 1876. Democrats have stolen several.
1324070856402915336 2020-11-05 03:27:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 This is such a great setup for the nuclear option.
1324069509918040068 2020-11-05 03:22:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates Between dead votes in Chicago, illegals in California, etc. we don't know who really won the PV in any particular election.
1324068913513201665 2020-11-05 03:20:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This 👇
1324068232857374721 2020-11-05 03:17:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Seriously: If the Trump Camp thinks a hundred thousand Biden votes are total trash, I don't care how unlikely you think that is, Trump's Camp has the right to make their case in a court of law.
1324067315462320128 2020-11-05 03:13:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We need to be united right now. The Trump Camp thinks they've won the election. None of this infighting or doomsaying. We're in this together until every *legitimate* vote is counted and every *illegitimate* one is not.
1324065462725054470 2020-11-05 03:06:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation Of course, the moment after Trump's camp contests the results.
1324058377069187074 2020-11-05 02:38:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> And for all you wignats: This is much bigger than race or anything like that. We have to be united in this thing. There's clearly enough non-PC minorities to pull this thing off.
1324057735806242819 2020-11-05 02:35:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There are million of Biden voters who will regret their cowardice in the face of this extreme evil.
1324057477525196802 2020-11-05 02:34:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Sorry, but it is a moral duty at this point to delegitimize leftist institutions. The only way Biden might even eke this thing out is systematic suppression, lies, and the kitchen sink thrown at Trump and he still increased his national vote share.
1324057140278005761 2020-11-05 02:33:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat The media spent 4 years suppressing Trump support, lying about virtually everything. Democratic Governors spread fear and panic in their populations and they still didn't get a mandate. If you don't spend the next 4 years delegitimizing everything of their, you're wrong.
1324053943408877569 2020-11-05 02:20:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rubatirabbit1 Seems likely.
1324052785369894916 2020-11-05 02:15:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NeandertalCniht @realikamusume No one is updating the EDay vote totals.
1324049008508215296 2020-11-05 02:00:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ProudColonizer They're clearly fringe, though. A bigger fringe than some of these Southern suburbs, but a fringe.
1324048667582619651 2020-11-05 01:59:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The popular vote isn't real and we have learned that today if we didn't already in 2016. God knows how many harvested ballots come out of Chicago, California, and New York every cycle.
1324048240644444164 2020-11-05 01:57:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Brian_Lardin @SwampFox8 @RyanAFournier They're going to Trump.
1324047960561377282 2020-11-05 01:56:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Just need to stop the steal in PA and there's the White House.
1324047542900895744 2020-11-05 01:55:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KarnatakaYankee Very fringe there too. Biden isn't running that far ahead of the Senate candidates there. I'm basing NE-2 off the fact Sasse did way better than Trump in Omaha.
1324047201857900544 2020-11-05 01:53:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 @CottoGottfried @NoctRomaRTW I'm never turning that channel on again. Not even for Tucker.

1324046539652767746 2020-11-05 01:51:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The only places NeverTrump GOPers seem to exist are a fringe element in Arizona, NE-2, and NoVA.
1324045967528730628 2020-11-05 01:48:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried @NoctRomaRTW Screw him. Too little. Too late.
1324045746673471488 2020-11-05 01:48:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 @RyanAFournier I think we're at 268 because NE-2 cucked.
1324045470105219074 2020-11-05 01:46:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JustinTime931 @RyanAFournier There was always more of the vote out there.
1324044024827793408 2020-11-05 01:41:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat It might appear that way, but we don't have any of the relevant offices in the State of Nevada and that makes stopping their shenanigans harder.
1324038077346684933 2020-11-05 01:17:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nc_groyp @RedEaglePatriot Prosecutions will come.
1324037788057088004 2020-11-05 01:16:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nc_groyp @RedEaglePatriot Those votes WILL get counted.
1324037545668345856 2020-11-05 01:15:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WMiddleton1837 @RedEaglePatriot I think 10K is more likely.
1324037248938053632 2020-11-05 01:14:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @eye_idol @BrianSh86084519 Yeah. That one will probably be the hardest.
1324037114854604800 2020-11-05 01:13:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot 520K. 60-40 and he wins.
1324036855621451776 2020-11-05 01:12:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CransleyPerfume Either after Democrats think the GOP can’t win or they don’t have anymore mail ins to harvest.
1324036202023002114 2020-11-05 01:10:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 They definitely did ballot harvesting. Those ballots need to be thrown out.
1324035767526674432 2020-11-05 01:08:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm really hoping the GOP pulls through in Arizona. That seems like the easiest path right now despite the call. Certainly one that involves the least legal headache. That's assuming they don't print a million ballots in PA.
1324034559726571521 2020-11-05 01:03:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Has any incumbent ever increased their vote total in every state of the Union and lost?
1324032182420201472 2020-11-05 00:54:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Basically every bellwether will be upset if Trump ends up losing this election. Vigo County. Luzerne. Erie.
1324031896142172163 2020-11-05 00:52:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dbongino @catturd2 Mysteriously Republican vote counters work hard and count votes as long as possible and Democrats hold it up.
1324028731665645575 2020-11-05 00:40:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @wasphyxiation Same with WA. I hear people are calling shenanigans there too.
1324026052801343489 2020-11-05 00:29:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I apologize.
1324025878695862275 2020-11-05 00:29:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK There are two counties in the whole country urban turnout is up (besides Trump favorable Miami-Dade, laughably enough) and they just so happen to be putting Dems their lead in their states.
1324020278956011522 2020-11-05 00:06:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 @JayFiveK They have ordered new elections before. Also, the state legislatures in many of these states are Republican and could award the electors to Trump.
1324018748928499716 2020-11-05 00:00:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Adobo_Autist @wasphyxiation Both sides are being strategic, but Democrats have some key office-holding advantages in the states in play that could have always turned against us in this crazy scenario.
1324018525682499586 2020-11-04 23:59:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Adobo_Autist @wasphyxiation We're not counting votes the way we usually do. All these percentages are all over the place. No one really knows how many votes there are. Exactly what Dems wanted in their states and Republicans in their states. It's really a sham.
1324018238808821763 2020-11-04 23:58:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep @StevenWalter_ That will be the highest turnout runoff ever. GOP Edge, though.
1324018149818335232 2020-11-04 23:58:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StevenWalter_ @realkingprep They'll do it if they can. She's the real candidate.
1324018062404833280 2020-11-04 23:57:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Getting edgy, there, friend. Almost as edgy as me.
1324017612775432192 2020-11-04 23:56:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StevenWalter_ @realkingprep Yes. It could. If somehow Democrats pull off the Senate, then Harris will be President. *shudders*.
1324017274966212610 2020-11-04 23:54:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep @StevenWalter_ He would if he can I imagine. Would be hilariously dumb not to. Also, I have my doubts as to whether the Succession Act would be Constitutional in this deadlock scenario.
1324016966512889856 2020-11-04 23:53:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StevenWalter_ @realkingprep It doesn't envision this scenario at all because it expects the sides to come together and do a bargain, which neither side has the incentive to do right now. If Pence can break the tie in the Senate, he would be President until he forced Pelosi to make Trump President.
1324016619589390339 2020-11-04 23:52:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep @StevenWalter_ Can he break the tie?
1324016413309313024 2020-11-04 23:51:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf That remains to be seen. I remain skeptical anyone has the balls.
1324016042826452997 2020-11-04 23:49:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I thought this election was 1948. Turned out it was 1948+1960.
1324015705734434818 2020-11-04 23:48:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StevenWalter_ @realkingprep No one technically knows what would happen at that point because it has never happened. Would cause a genuine constitutional crisis: The first real constitutional crisis in our history.
1324015486389133320 2020-11-04 23:47:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChrisRaab3 @RealAPolitics Yes. They printed ballots on suspiciously high turnout for an urban.
1324015145941716994 2020-11-04 23:46:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep @StevenWalter_ Ties don't vote and you need a majority of states. No one will have that at the end of the night, but the GOP will have an edge. Would get real wild. Senate might be 50-50. That would be the true gamer scenario: No President, Vice-President on January 20th.
1324013856260280324 2020-11-04 23:41:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed @LueYee Biden's improvement on Hillary's numbers is pretty consistent across all swing/purplish states. So are Trump's. Except in MI and WI where mysteriously Biden is being pushed over the top by national turnout highs in urbans. Even Illinois and New York are relatively more narrow.
1324012570550947840 2020-11-04 23:36:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed @LueYee Agreed, it was completely irresponsible of FNC to call it at close, though. There were clearly ways the votes *could* have stacked up in Trump's favor, even if narrowly.   Totally convinced on WI and MI at this point, though. Their turnout doesn't make sense.
1324011796773175298 2020-11-04 23:33:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation That's from Trump's Camp.
1324009472847683585 2020-11-04 23:23:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried @NoctRomaRTW PA margin sounds about right. NV: It's going to be close.
1324006308211838976 2020-11-04 23:11:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad Maricopa has 520K votes out apparently. No one knows what's going on.
1324005825329958915 2020-11-04 23:09:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad Nah. There are more votes than that apparently. He needs 60-40 to flip it.
1324005634040365061 2020-11-04 23:08:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark Mysteriously none of this crap happened in Ohio, Florida, and Texas: States with total GOP government at basically all levels.
1324002427956301827 2020-11-04 22:55:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Oh, I see what you're saying.
1324002314223558656 2020-11-04 22:55:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation @BobLobl53498620 Shenanigans were definitely afoot in Maricopa County with their Democrat Recorder. GOP votes not getting counted, etc.
1324002132358537220 2020-11-04 22:54:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Wisconsin's numbers make more sense to me, but I'm still not buying Milwaukee and Wayne turnout numbers.
1324001627477549057 2020-11-04 22:52:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BankerG2 Ohio was a high turnout election too. I'm saying the numbers aren't proportional to the demographics. You wouldn't expect this in a vacuum.
1324001448389156867 2020-11-04 22:51:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Like this election is basically the 2016 contest numbers wise, with Trump improving by some margin of votes in red states. Then you have this "blue wall" where mysteriously Biden just got a huge number more votes than Hillary.
1324000976332869635 2020-11-04 22:50:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biden got 200K more votes than Hillary in Ohio. Somehow, in Michigan, a state with fewer voters, he has 250K more than Clinton while Trump also as 220K votes than he got in 2016 (notable a proportional number to how many more he got in Ohio). This makes no sense.
1323996642807291905 2020-11-04 22:32:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation Ohio isn't even a big early voting state.
1323996570753314819 2020-11-04 22:32:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation Ohio did it too. There's no excuse for this from Democrat states.
1323995223714910208 2020-11-04 22:27:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm not even sure about PA at this point. This all seems planned in advance.
1323994684704935938 2020-11-04 22:25:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They're literally printing ballots across the country and TrueCons are like "whatever."
1323990867082883077 2020-11-04 22:09:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Republican States/Jurisdictions:  Tallied the Biden votes first, Trump crushed it afterwards, but not unexpectedly so. Democrat States: Tallied the Trump votes first. Biden gets hundreds of thousands votes unanswered in Democrat strongholds on record turnout.
1323990272313860096 2020-11-04 22:07:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 140000 votes at once all for Biden.
1323989941483982855 2020-11-04 22:06:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> “Oh, who cares if we ran an election where 140,000 votes are tabulated all for one losing candidate all at once. All the same to me!” Why do you even bother?
1323989602332540932 2020-11-04 22:04:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I don’t understand the conservatives who act like this isn’t a big deal. The left saw a threat to their power and they spent the past four years concocting fake scandals and refusing to even engage disaffected people. Of course, TrueCons are in on the whole scam.
1323985000220471298 2020-11-04 21:46:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @baalwark These states vote together. Trump does go from 51%-&gt;53% and then lose narrowly in every other rust belt state. Same true in Indiana and Iowa.
1323984564415549442 2020-11-04 21:44:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou That’s because they didn’t know they had to rig 2016.
1323983630876770305 2020-11-04 21:41:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Like, seriously, Trump ran Ohio running away. There’s no way Biden just so happens to eke out a win with a bunch of absentee ballots breaking harder than every other state in the Union.
1323927489400524801 2020-11-04 17:58:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Guys, don’t let them get you down. We will fight this all the way. We won’t let them steal this.
1323927115964829696 2020-11-04 17:56:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Michigan: There’s a lot of room left in Wayne for Biden to grow. But, Trump does still have some strongholds with votes left.
1323926245252468738 2020-11-04 17:53:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChaserWestbrook It’s just so weird that Trump surged everywhere and then you hit a Democrat Governed state and suddenly...it ticks down a few points.
1323925560578482176 2020-11-04 17:50:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All I’m going to say is this election appears very different in states with Republican governors and states with Democrat governors.
1323924043964256256 2020-11-04 17:44:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark Yes. Let’s see if they can do Michigan now.
1323923351593693185 2020-11-04 17:41:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I don’t think there are enough votes there unfortunately. Concerned about Michigan now.
1323922525919809537 2020-11-04 17:38:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis I’m not buying these Milwaukee turnout numbers.
1323921613004378112 2020-11-04 17:34:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biden ahead after the Milwaukee dump. Brown County dump may bring it back for Trump, though.
1323921314747473921 2020-11-04 17:33:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 Decision Desk:  https://t.co/jndq4bbZYj
1323921062447505409 2020-11-04 17:32:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 Wait, what, now Biden is ahead by 2K
1323920941601202176 2020-11-04 17:32:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 Trump still leads the state by 22K votes.
1323920692379832320 2020-11-04 17:31:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 Looks like it just dropped.
1323917456574976000 2020-11-04 17:18:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Blue state anti-lockdown vote is real in New York is another thing we learned tonight. Trump could have won a risky landslide if he had went Full Sweden on rona in March.
1323916828842876928 2020-11-04 17:15:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @SelimSeesYou That’s literally it. Their votes will forever be a shame, especially as Trump is victorious.
1323916189358346240 2020-11-04 17:13:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 There are actually 3 million votes outstanding in Philadelphia cemeteries.
1323915749401001984 2020-11-04 17:11:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @SelimSeesYou About 5-10% of Biden’s voters literally just cast a vote to surrender.
1323914883449147393 2020-11-04 17:08:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV What we’ve learned today:  1. Shy suburban Trumpers are real. Trump barely regressed in the suburbs at all. Some he flat out advanced in. 2. Rural turnout was real in much of the country.
1323914318547734529 2020-11-04 17:05:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @xCptJackSparrow @NationalistTV Yeah. They’ll need to stuff like multiple precincts worth of boxes.
1323914088766996480 2020-11-04 17:04:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @xCptJackSparrow @Reactionaryguy @NationalistTV We will not be disenfranchised.
1323913925411409922 2020-11-04 17:04:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This man is a liar. I’m not even sure there are enough voters in WI to do that. Turnout is already well past 2016 in the reported votes and Trump blasted past his 2016 total in WI.  PA, he’s including unreturned mail ins. Probably because they’re desperate to find them.
1323913141017870337 2020-11-04 17:01:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mansf1eld1563 @RealAPolitics BS. No one is actually estimating that. He must be including unreturned mail ballots.
1323912808468238337 2020-11-04 16:59:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mansf1eld1563 @RealAPolitics Who’s saying that? That would be psycho turnout.
1323912530708877318 2020-11-04 16:58:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StevenB57195754 @RealAPolitics Estimated over 95% are counted.
1323911430442242048 2020-11-04 16:54:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SavnRyansPrvate @klarkgallagher @NationalistTV Like I said, even if they do break Biden, at this point the lead is too great there. He’d need to flat flip Green Bay at this point and that ain’t happening.
1323911184068784128 2020-11-04 16:53:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV No one knows if all the ballots are mail in or if they’re even there. The break Biden needs is ridiculous. And Wisconsin is out of reach too. There’s no path to 270 for Joe Biden.
1323910545314140160 2020-11-04 16:50:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @klarkgallagher @SavnRyansPrvate @NationalistTV Wisconsin is not on the table. There’s just not many votes left on the table and a lot of them are in Green Bay, which should break for Trump. Even if they break Biden, not by enough.
1323910296482828289 2020-11-04 16:49:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SavnRyansPrvate @NationalistTV Nevada was a narrow miss and if the remaining votes there are EDay, there is a path to a narrow Trump win.
1323909568582324227 2020-11-04 16:46:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou At this point James’s overperformance is narrow. Technically James is getting fewer votes, just a larger share. Apparently a lot of people Voted Trump and didn’t vote for Senate or voted 3rd Party. Also, Wisconsin has Brown with a lot of votes left to count: Trump Country.
1323908288979865600 2020-11-04 16:41:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou I just can’t believe he’ll come up short at this point. He doesn’t need many votes in the rust belt to be over the top, especially in PA and WI. I haven’t checked MI in a while. MI *might* be a red mirage a bit, but if what we saw in the other states come to fruition, it isn’t.
1323907574253584384 2020-11-04 16:38:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou Given the kind of night it is, we all know who has had all the luck too. Honestly, Trump has outperformed my expectations in some of these places.
1323907104130871296 2020-11-04 16:37:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark It’s potential recount territory. “Potential” being a very loose term here.
1323906782486560768 2020-11-04 16:35:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou A lot of it depends on where they are too. Like we *know* there are 350K mail in ballots in Philly. If those are less than 90-10 for Biden, he’s finished. No way they are in the rest of the state.
1323906196093415426 2020-11-04 16:33:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou Decision Desk is saying between 1 and 1.5. If any of those are still Election Day, it’s not good for Biden.
1323905973883383809 2020-11-04 16:32:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou At a more realistic million votes outstanding, it’s just not possible. He’d need 85% of them.
1323905743138021380 2020-11-04 16:31:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou Just doing some rough math it doesn’t look even possible for him until until you get to like 1.5 million outstanding mail in votes that haven’t been counted. Then they’d have to go 1.1 million to 400K and then you’re at a tie. There are definitely still Trump votes out there too.
1323903381447053312 2020-11-04 16:22:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @lawlietg79 @SelimSeesYou I’m hearing rumors that there are way more votes out there that haven’t been counted than is reported. If there are a million Election Day votes out there somewhere, then Trump could still pull it off. I’m growing more suspicious of shenanigans as the night goes on.
1323902707191681024 2020-11-04 16:19:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou PA the big question is no one really knows how many votes are out or where they are. It’s pretty clear Biden needs at least 80% of them, though. An unbelievable margin considering only 350K of them are in Philly.
1323902160153829378 2020-11-04 16:17:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan *safe
1323902043384401922 2020-11-04 16:16:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan South Dakota is age. But Montana? Do not like. Especially because they’re picking up a seat.
1323900713311764481 2020-11-04 16:11:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ToshJann @SirDowden Arizona.
1323900189539815425 2020-11-04 16:09:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden There are like three swing states that swung heavily against Trump. Everyone else is even or showing Trump improvement. Kind of strange.
1323899079403950080 2020-11-04 16:05:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ticviking @JayFiveK Trump won’t let them do it. We’ve got this. There’s only so much they can do. That, and they’re likely all going to go to prison. Maybe all of them will anyway.
1323897796177596416 2020-11-04 16:00:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fitzwarren12 @SelimSeesYou I can kind of get it in 1960. The issues just didn’t seem to be that great: Let the corrupt husk of a man win narrowly. This is 2020: Our way of life is at stake. Fight every stuffed ballot envelope everywhere.
1323895943008296960 2020-11-04 15:52:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Wait a second: If it’s the Election Day vote in Las Vegas and Reno outstanding it might actually put him ahead.
1323895642931011584 2020-11-04 15:51:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Wait, what, was I early? Holy shit.
1323894880284909568 2020-11-04 15:48:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Like, Biden needs like 90% of the outstanding vote in Pennsylvania. He needs at least two thirds in WI and MI. Possibly already beyond his reach in WI, but no one knows how many votes are outstanding.
1323894465447239680 2020-11-04 15:46:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK They’re racking up so many Trump votes in Wisconsin and Penn they won’t be able to stuff enough boxes.
1323890211806420992 2020-11-04 15:29:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SlipMaker @SelimSeesYou PA+AK+WI. Wisconsin is looking very good for Trump right now. Blasted past his 2016 totals. Total Dem turnout collapse.
1323889374455615489 2020-11-04 15:26:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou He’s declaring overall victory. Even contesting Arizona. I think he’s right to do so.
1323889220864352256 2020-11-04 15:26:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SlipMaker @SelimSeesYou He did.
1323884679695650816 2020-11-04 15:07:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LVB_19 @wasphyxiation They’re scouring every post office from here to Timbuktu (literally) to find Penn mail ins right now.
1323883233440923650 2020-11-04 15:02:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ToshJann @Vaiv71738794 @CitadelMark There could be a lot of Democrat votes left in Wayne. That’s a concern.
1323881515135258626 2020-11-04 14:55:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation He might be going to pass 40% in New York. First Republican to do so since Bush 04, who narrowly beat that. Last one before that was Bush 88.
1323880811658182657 2020-11-04 14:52:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Vaiv71738794 @CitadelMark Yeah, I think PA is going to be beyond a margin they can reasonably take. However, MI and WI look very tight.
1323878437942079488 2020-11-04 14:43:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark As I figured: The math just isn’t there for Joe there. Damn this is a fight.
1323877495863709698 2020-11-04 14:39:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis I don’t know.
1323877447801147393 2020-11-04 14:39:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CransleyPerfume Most probably.
1323877367408959488 2020-11-04 14:38:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @lambeth981 With 25% of the vote outstanding, getting 300K of them will put him over the top. It doesn’t matter where they come from.
1323876849198444544 2020-11-04 14:36:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump needs about 300K more votes *somewhere* in PA. It doesn’t matter where.
1323876596915294210 2020-11-04 14:35:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @luismen1991 @SelimSeesYou That’s your analysis?
1323875050529968128 2020-11-04 14:29:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Seriously.
1323874947807219713 2020-11-04 14:29:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 I get this totally. The people I’m talking about it are the people who worry Trump’s margin slightly changed in a county because they dumped mail ins.
1323874719838470144 2020-11-04 14:28:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is the problem with running a third world election. There’s so much fog of war. We don’t really know how many votes are left out or even where. Trump has overpeformed in several big Rust Belt suburbs so far, though.
1323874108355084288 2020-11-04 14:25:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ori_Ar Virtually impossible.
1323874054089170944 2020-11-04 14:25:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Some of you guys really worry about everything. Trump is overperforming most places it really matters and you’re still trying to doom. Like, there are still plenty of Trump votes left in the Rust Belt. It ebbs and flows as mail ins and then IP votes are counted everywhere. Chaos.
1323873125784821761 2020-11-04 14:22:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Clark dropped: Going to Biden for sure.
1323872571465629696 2020-11-04 14:19:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim More than likely. I wouldn’t give up total hope.
1323872211346870274 2020-11-04 14:18:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Ok. So Nevada dropped Washoe: Not looking good. Will need Clark to really come in by less than 4 points.
1323871463485693952 2020-11-04 14:15:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp It appears that’s Trump path to victory there. He nearly has it. But it’s going to be close.
1323870511366066176 2020-11-04 14:11:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Ok, in Indiana, Ohio, and Iowa, Trump is up like 2% on his 2016 share. This bodes well for the remaining votes in PA and MI especially. Wisconsin a bit different of an animal. Isn’t trending with the others.
1323869308368408576 2020-11-04 14:06:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheAquaMariner @B17Fortres Too early, but Trump expanding his margins in the rurals in a tight state makes it a race. It was decided less than 30K votes last time and we’ve already cut 3K into it.
1323868410271457281 2020-11-04 14:03:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 Trump doesn’t need that many of the outstanding votes in PA. He needs like 40% to be comfortable.
1323866586793521152 2020-11-04 13:56:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @markjbult Biden needs to win the outstanding votes well over 3:1, maybe more because no one really knows how many of them there are. It might look possible, but there’s enough EDay votes in there to prevent it from happening.
1323866010290716672 2020-11-04 13:53:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheAquaMariner @markjbult It was in 2016 too.
1323865538137886725 2020-11-04 13:51:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @markjbult Yes he does.
1323865080782589953 2020-11-04 13:50:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Sorry, but initial returns from Nevada rurals are VERY encouraging. If Trump can just narrow Las Vegas a little...he can win. He has already exceeded his 2016 margins in several counties. PA+NV is a win.  Stop worrying about GA. It ain’t happening for Biden.
1323862943575035904 2020-11-04 13:41:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @AnglicanMan19 I don’t know. It’s going to be tight in PA.
1323862686548008961 2020-11-04 13:40:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 This guy is a moron.
1323862155406548992 2020-11-04 13:38:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @billsretpal Lmao.
1323855895164555266 2020-11-04 13:13:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Deplorable1984 I'm just out of fuel.
1323853403357876231 2020-11-04 13:03:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm calling it a night. This election will end up in SCOTUS: That's my call as of this moment.
1323852471563931648 2020-11-04 12:59:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume He is correct. Arizona is Biden's in 80% of universes right now. Of course, this is a 20% universe apparently.
1323852203837263874 2020-11-04 12:58:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @coronayomama That's what they're doing.
1323850086191927299 2020-11-04 12:50:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm very optimistic about PA because I think a lot of the suburban vote left outstanding is the EDay vote which leans heavily towards Trump. However, I'm cautious because a lot of the rural vote out is mail in and favorable to Biden.
1323849062630760448 2020-11-04 12:46:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Really? They hadn't called it when they called Arizona with a quarter of the vote out. Seriously, these people are criminals.
1323847835910082561 2020-11-04 12:41:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark Mail ins.
1323846276077785088 2020-11-04 12:35:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou FNC is just bad tonight. I've never seen a news outlet this irresponsible. Unethical. Incompetent. Ignoring national trends.
1323844930628968448 2020-11-04 12:30:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume FNC is an irresponsible media outlet.
1323840890868301826 2020-11-04 12:13:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ellen6019 As of right now, it's not looking good.
1323840384473174020 2020-11-04 12:11:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @paulasport20011 See follow up Tweet.
1323840272497811457 2020-11-04 12:11:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is an affluent Cleveland suburb with a similar profile to Chester.
1323839861216940032 2020-11-04 12:09:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump won Lorain County. Good news for Chester County.
1323838410797338636 2020-11-04 12:04:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Remember the vote was over half registered GOP and only 18% Dem this morning. Probably got worse. That's the outstanding vote.
1323838248507113473 2020-11-04 12:03:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Samhydabber12 @SelimSeesYou We can Nevada and it won't matter.
1323837809275269120 2020-11-04 12:01:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I don't even know.
1323837772067704832 2020-11-04 12:01:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pimpisyou Party of my Arizona is really gay map.
1323837391539441664 2020-11-04 12:00:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> My Arizona is really gay map is *possible* right now.
1323835876816936966 2020-11-04 11:54:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis I'm concerned we've got a mix of red and blue mirage overall. I think there are plenty more votes in PA for Trump out, though and the trends are that Trump is maintaining or expanding his vote totals in the key counties he needs.
1323835401434501120 2020-11-04 11:52:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump got 320K more votes at least in North Carolina than last time.
1323833583031717889 2020-11-04 11:44:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Neither am I. Tighter than I'd like.
1323833493206552576 2020-11-04 11:44:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacksonPackson1 Yeah. They haven't counted EDay yet. You can almost tell what portion is early and mail by following Baris's polls in these state lol.
1323832995791384576 2020-11-04 11:42:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 75% of the vote in in AZ. EDay out. EDay was supposed to be 2:1 there.
1323831234376728578 2020-11-04 11:35:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark "1 for Trump. 2 for Trump."
1323830379783081985 2020-11-04 11:32:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Decision Desk HQ Delaware County numbers are just wrong. That's the Tweet.
1323830075134017536 2020-11-04 11:31:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cogi2_ErgoTsun Not enough votes it's looking like.
1323829232196268032 2020-11-04 11:27:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BCLive5 With these numbers: Not really, but we don't really know with crazy way these states are reporting numbers.
1323828037683695617 2020-11-04 11:22:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 @cera_larry Who cares.
1323827405581148161 2020-11-04 11:20:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Loser.
1323827064093499392 2020-11-04 11:19:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cera_larry Yes. He's in the lead. Need more out of Southeast, but not all of the EDay vote has been counted.
1323826937933008898 2020-11-04 11:18:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Margins are narrowing everywhere as soon as EDay votes are counted.
1323826707917381633 2020-11-04 11:17:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 It won't be enough. This is yuge.
1323826367557967875 2020-11-04 11:16:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> PA is looking really good for Trump.
1323826203745275905 2020-11-04 11:15:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Everyone keeps panicking when these early votes dump when it's obvious the narrative is on fire.
1323821621677871105 2020-11-04 10:57:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 If Trump gets 52.5% in Ohio, regardless of margin, I'm almost certain he will win.
1323820934139125761 2020-11-04 10:54:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Also: I'm very optimistic about Donald Trump carrying the White House at this point and whatever happens, the polls were freaking awful.
1323820215139028995 2020-11-04 10:51:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Just a word of warning: Some of these states are reporting their numbers differently. Some have red mirage. Some have blue mirage. I think this *might* be varying by county in Pennsylvania.
1323819557392363525 2020-11-04 10:49:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark I'd end up on the wrong side of the line, but I endorse this 120%.
1323819056374448128 2020-11-04 10:47:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GarrettFAdams They aren't at least violating long time codes of journalistic ethics.
1323818671337316355 2020-11-04 10:45:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CryptonMaximus @ThracianGroyper Yes, but some votes are in: Big unknown if they're only counting EDay right now. Virginia is terrible at counting votes. The worst state in the union. I'm not kidding.
1323816704024158208 2020-11-04 10:37:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Fox News is an irresponsible media outlet. Do not watch them.
1323816616988233730 2020-11-04 10:37:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation If he gets 52.5% of the vote, the margin is irrelevant. He will have expanded his majority and he was very closes to a majority in PA.
1323816348405911554 2020-11-04 10:36:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @shuggabumfairy I'm done with them. They're obvious losers.
1323814823352819713 2020-11-04 10:30:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy Yes.
1323814569471545348 2020-11-04 10:29:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy They're counting the mail ins and as the in person early and EDay vote is counted, Trump takes big lead.
1323813482249289728 2020-11-04 10:25:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThracianGroyper They didn't realize the shy suburban Trumper is real.
1323813257786871814 2020-11-04 10:24:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tempustempus I can't believe this shit is happening again.
1323812886293131267 2020-11-04 10:22:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @rwg4302 The CNN Exit Polls were actually pretty good for him.
1323812736023842816 2020-11-04 10:22:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark One America News. It's the right call. It's still lean Biden, but we need more votes. The shy Suburban Trumper is real.
1323812510349275137 2020-11-04 10:21:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There's more like a Blue Mirage right now than Red Mirage. I'm honestly shocked I was right. LMAO.
1323812146069835777 2020-11-04 10:19:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @shuggabumfairy @RealCandaceO I knew that was BS from the get go
1323810048204820480 2020-11-04 10:11:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks @thehangingchads They'll regret it, though.
1323807128642035712 2020-11-04 09:59:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This will be a 2016 or so margin in Virginia. Still might pull closer if this Loudoun margins are real.
1323803907865432067 2020-11-04 09:47:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis @Fuckgsw2 @Ori_Ar I don't really know about it. Everywhere else Trump is advancing. Wait to see the full vote.
1323802806608867328 2020-11-04 09:42:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 @Ori_Ar BS. They though Biden won the early vote 2:1. He didn't.
1323802730679443456 2020-11-04 09:42:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SR71999 Southern Blacks are more loyal than Northern Blacks.
1323802538529984514 2020-11-04 09:41:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ori_Ar Early votes.
1323802230621904897 2020-11-04 09:40:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Black Trumpers are real. The votes prove it.
1323801931807137793 2020-11-04 09:39:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pimpisyou @SelimSeesYou Fairfax vote is down as a share of the vote BIG. As of 5 PM, they hadn't even hit 2016 turnout.
1323800992526336000 2020-11-04 09:35:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Virginia might be a race. For real. These margins in Virginia Beach and Chesterfield County are insane.
1323796530948694016 2020-11-04 09:17:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Just mean results so far.
1323796420093235200 2020-11-04 09:17:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SR71999 Yeah, early votes from there too. It only gets more GOP from here.
1323796201930661889 2020-11-04 09:16:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Ohio is basically Cuyahoga and Franklin.
1323795849470742528 2020-11-04 09:15:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 Wait for some results, friend.
1323795647275978752 2020-11-04 09:14:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 It looked like this at this point of the night in 2016 if I recall.
1323795467759689729 2020-11-04 09:13:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis Still weighted by the dumb polls.
1323795366156947457 2020-11-04 09:13:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Seriously, Fairfax County is ridiculously irresponsible with how long it takes them to count votes.
1323794974673166341 2020-11-04 09:11:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates Trump's campaign was really pushing down low that they got 45% or more of the vote in Miami Dade.
1323794786424414210 2020-11-04 09:10:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates I didn't even believe the Trump Camp's 45% rumors. Thought it'd be like 40-42.
1323794567318130688 2020-11-04 09:09:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BasedMorrowind Just having fun, friend.
1323794429321379842 2020-11-04 09:09:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BasedMorrowind Cubanos y Venezolanos son Blanco.
1323794144091930626 2020-11-04 09:08:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Going to move to Miami and find me a hot Cuban or Venezuelan chica.
1323793685864239104 2020-11-04 09:06:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Latinos might have delivered Donald Trump reelection in 2020. The past 4 years has been insane. What a time to be alive.
1323793453436801025 2020-11-04 09:05:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 Yeah. The margins was too big for it to be not fraud, though. What I'm seeing so far in downstate counties seems better than 2016....Including Fauqier, which is the edge of NoVA.
1323792678182625287 2020-11-04 09:02:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> As usual, Fairfax County is waiting to see how many ballots they need to print.
1323792358450888711 2020-11-04 09:01:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ToshJann Not as many as these polls would indicate. Maybe a 1 or 2 point regression.
1323792251823312898 2020-11-04 09:00:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheAquaMariner Southern suburbs diverging from northern suburbs over industrial issues. Southern suburbs go from Republicans for Evangelical reasons usually. Northerners would go for them for economic reasons.
1323791315130327043 2020-11-04 08:56:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think it's likely correct, but I still think it's irresponsible. If Virginia Beach is 60-40 for Trump and so is Chesterfield, then it's a race in Virginia. Fragmentary returns. Might be unusually Republican precincts.
1323790286569508864 2020-11-04 08:52:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Counterpoint: Virginia Beach is 60%.
1323789985057775617 2020-11-04 08:51:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheAquaMariner Pinellas is basically a tie. Duval looks more like a Southern Suburb.
1323789674637393923 2020-11-04 08:50:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiah_crawley Nationwide. Not that Hillsborough is a northern suburb, but doesn't have the same characteristics as say, Cobb County.
1323789313105080322 2020-11-04 08:49:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Hillsborough is only Biden+8. That's good news for suburbs. My theory on Southern and Northern suburbs diverging might prove true.
1323787888379731972 2020-11-04 08:43:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis It does, but he has room for error there he doesn’t in other states.
1323787776106635269 2020-11-04 08:42:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 Yes.
1323787059908255746 2020-11-04 08:40:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Whatever else happens tonight, boys: Fuck the polls.
1323783270459445248 2020-11-04 08:25:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis @Ori_Ar Yes.
1323781813500841984 2020-11-04 08:19:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @royallprick They ain't even closed yet. They're still romping on Biden up there!
1323781594553946113 2020-11-04 08:18:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 @CasualsNorthern It was 29.5
1323781524320182272 2020-11-04 08:18:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis Panhandle my dude
1323781137030881281 2020-11-04 08:16:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 45% in Miami Dade! 45% in Miami Dade!
1323780312665591808 2020-11-04 08:13:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @paulasport20011 Projected 41.7% in Hillsborough, 43.7% of the early vote went to him.
1323780158881435649 2020-11-04 08:12:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Underperforming in Sumter, though. Haven't checked others.
1323780011745304580 2020-11-04 08:12:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @real_1776 @Theo_Chilton @revjackashcraft I'm not worried about Kentucky, but if Biden wins his counties by more while Trump does win his by more, Biden wins.
1323779889137410049 2020-11-04 08:11:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump is outperforming the TargetSmart "Modeled Republican" vote in Pasco County and Hillsborough so far.....
1323776885638209538 2020-11-04 07:59:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 We really won't know that yet.
1323776270874873856 2020-11-04 07:57:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Sorry about Kentucky: Appears to be all mail in so far.
1323775411956961281 2020-11-04 07:53:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Yeah, that leaned heavily Dem. In person was larger and leaned heavily for Trump. We’re going to need more results if this is pure mail in.
1323774248410906630 2020-11-04 07:49:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 Hopefully, but I'm pretty confident saying he has regressed in Fayette.
1323773377375621120 2020-11-04 07:45:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump maintaining his margin in Fort Wayne. Good news for other exurbs
1323771807950905344 2020-11-04 07:39:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cummymonke @ManuelB59425346 Lol.
1323771503243108353 2020-11-04 07:38:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cigarticker @Peoples_Pundit Thank you.
1323771232949555201 2020-11-04 07:37:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Does anyone know when the @Peoples_Pundit broadcast starts?
1323770610615463937 2020-11-04 07:34:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing He only lost by 9.5%. He's on track to lose by well more than that.
1323770462330146816 2020-11-04 07:34:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @ellen6019 Maybe I am. Hopefully.
1323770171769716737 2020-11-04 07:32:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @ellen6019 If we see more of that shit, yes.
1323770112172851210 2020-11-04 07:32:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChaserWestbrook Oh, Trump will win Kentucky.
1323770059618213888 2020-11-04 07:32:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JorgvonWartburg Trump, but this break is big. Hopefully Trump romped EDay turnout.
1323769954450231296 2020-11-04 07:32:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ellen6019 Clinton got 69,000 votes in the county and Biden is at 61,000 already. Unless something dramatically shift there, that's bad.
1323769512106303498 2020-11-04 07:30:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There's no spinning the fact the results in Fayette County, Kentucky are bad.
1323769403519995906 2020-11-04 07:29:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CMazin1976 So Trump lost 3 points with fragmentary returns.
1323768893064781825 2020-11-04 07:27:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 Rural Indiana counties.
1323768830473211904 2020-11-04 07:27:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CMazin1976 You're just wrong.
1323767619707686914 2020-11-04 07:22:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sword_and_fount @Theo_Chilton Where are the results on Guardian.
1323767366375952384 2020-11-04 07:21:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation There is no way this is true with the collapse in Black turnout we've seen.
1323766473354104834 2020-11-04 07:18:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacksonPackson1 We will see when everything is reported. These are fragmentary returns.
1323765794342318080 2020-11-04 07:15:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton NYTimes is usually the best, but only USA Today has these results right now.
1323765434999558149 2020-11-04 07:14:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> He's 1% behind, but this is just the early vote. Might widen (or shrink, I guess) with EDay.
1323765197400641537 2020-11-04 07:13:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump is basically maintaining his margins in the two Indiana rurals reporting so far.
1323763711736270848 2020-11-04 07:07:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @user10000000007 @BrianSh86084519 And Fairfax is literally the entire Dem margin in this state.
1323763548779126787 2020-11-04 07:06:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @user10000000007 @BrianSh86084519 Richmond is even worse. Virginia Beach, which voted for Trump, is the only one with increased turnout.
1323763379098525698 2020-11-04 07:05:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tempustempus I still believe, but so many conflicting reports.
1323763093239980036 2020-11-04 07:04:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 Yes. Sorry, I feel more personally invested in this than I probably should.
1323761563707334663 2020-11-04 06:58:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 Look, at this point, we were either right or wrong. Either we’re delivering a win for Trump or this country has drastically changed just in the past 4 years and for the worse.
1323761262900236288 2020-11-04 06:57:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @user10000000007 @BrianSh86084519 I’m going to explain this once more: There are fewer total votes in Fairfax right now than there were in 2016 as of one hour ago.
1323760979038113797 2020-11-04 06:56:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GarrettFAdams A lot of Trump voters still don’t like the Republican Party. Of course, some Dem voters disapprove of the Dems I imagine.
1323760598237224961 2020-11-04 06:54:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Guys, I'm so freaking nervous.
1323760206665469955 2020-11-04 06:53:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @user10000000007 @BrianSh86084519 Those are actually mostly in person and Fairfax is lagging.
1323759790842105857 2020-11-04 06:51:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @20_mockingbird @SelimSeesYou Two house seats are flippable. The third we lost....If we got it back, it would just go back in 2 years.
1323759458552549376 2020-11-04 06:50:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy The issues that divide us in this country run very deep. This isn't "oh, he favors a different policy on China than me." This is "he wants us to live differently than we do." Like, normal people in history fight wars over this stuff.
1323758532022382592 2020-11-04 06:46:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark Richard Spencer cares more about universal healthcare and climate change than actual White people issues. What else would you expect from him?
1323758087027777539 2020-11-04 06:44:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @travis_john78 I can believe 75% want a pathway to citizenship number. 60% more government? What?
1323757889757085697 2020-11-04 06:44:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Government healthcare wasn't even that popular in the Democrat primaries.
1323757725214494724 2020-11-04 06:43:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KpopCatboy @SelimSeesYou No, they always find ways of guesstimating the other turnout.
1323757591802093576 2020-11-04 06:42:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton 70% of the public wants mask mandates and public healthcare it sounds like. Absolutely ridiculous.
1323757425581842433 2020-11-04 06:42:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They have 70% of the public favoring some kind of government healthcare and that wasn't even the case in the Democrat primaries.
1323757251023245312 2020-11-04 06:41:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation @BillTaggert That, and the low "worse off" from 4 years ago. Like, that's crazy low. That's just personal bad luck territory. These exit polls are kind of all over the place, though.
1323756947083005953 2020-11-04 06:40:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So it looks like the CNN exit polls are somewhat Trump favorable, but I don't even know what to make of FNC's voter analysis.
1323756550343766016 2020-11-04 06:38:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation Wait, this wasn't even above water in the Democrat Primary? This doesn't make sense.
1323756226782658561 2020-11-04 06:37:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BillTaggert @wasphyxiation It's literally all Dem ideologues. There's always one issue they pick to tell the pollster.
1323755288521048064 2020-11-04 06:33:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 Overall, yes, but that’s kind of a strong break
1323754745220206595 2020-11-04 06:31:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 The FNC exit polls have 60% strongly supporting mask mandates.
1323753009730519041 2020-11-04 06:24:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JoelLoren1 That’s one thing that might make these better for Trump, but people so strongly correlate between things going well and the President doing well, this is good news for Trump regardless.
1323752638710767616 2020-11-04 06:23:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @user10000000007 @BrianSh86084519 Like, we already know they didn’t.
1323752587888349184 2020-11-04 06:23:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @user10000000007 @BrianSh86084519 They didn’t.
1323752515108802560 2020-11-04 06:22:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan I’ve never seen them good for the Republicans. Ever. Almost makes me nervous that they’re teasing.
1323752146941157376 2020-11-04 06:21:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan 48% think we responded well to coronavirus.
1323751949909561344 2020-11-04 06:20:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Ok. Done being excited for the best exit polls for a Republican I can remember. VOTE
1323751637018697729 2020-11-04 06:19:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Chungus1488 @Cummymonke @amerikanism VOTE
1323751203138899969 2020-11-04 06:17:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou These look good to me. 48% approve of the US job on corona? How does Trump lose the election on that? That’s literally Biden’s whole campaign.
1323749544904052738 2020-11-04 06:11:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Then, there’s some people in the economy/bad corona camp who will vote Trump.
1323749279819845636 2020-11-04 06:09:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biden needs a huge advantage among the rona/bad camp to overcome a huge Trump advantage in economy/well camp.
1323749026404159488 2020-11-04 06:08:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 48% thinking we’re responding well to corona? Those people going to vote Biden?
1323748816391200768 2020-11-04 06:08:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Holy shit. Those are good numbers. Those are good numbers.
1323747322732388353 2020-11-04 06:02:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Libs relishing low Texas returns on EDay: We wouldn't hear anything from GOP rurals anyway and all that tells me is the Dems are tapped out in urban areas and suburbs.
1323746688759115776 2020-11-04 05:59:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @gbadamosiwole @Barnes_Law So many people had already voted there anyway. Nevada might not be huge, but the electorate was already more tilted GOP than 2016, so anything today is just gravy.
1323746227784163328 2020-11-04 05:57:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CatholicEcon Nevada the gap was already smaller than 2016 going into EDay.
1323745486243831811 2020-11-04 05:54:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @gbadamosiwole @Barnes_Law Florida. We're already well over the 2016 and 2018 advantages. Nevada the advantage has narrowed significantly too. Arizona Republicans are romping too, still on pace to get close to the 2016 gap. PA is foggier because no one has number, dummy.
1323744602457858048 2020-11-04 05:51:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @gbadamosiwole @Barnes_Law Literally everywhere dude.
1323742459768250370 2020-11-04 05:42:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @gbadamosiwole @Barnes_Law You people are so isolated, you assume everyone who didn't vote must lean blue. All the evidence is that the infrequent voters look more like Republicans than last time.
1323742281908760577 2020-11-04 05:42:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @gbadamosiwole @Barnes_Law Compare the turnout that year to 2000 and tell me how increased turnout always favors the Dems.
1323740949088972803 2020-11-04 05:36:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiah_crawley How would polling pick up something that can't be polled...Don't they notice the disconnect between Republican approval and Republican vote share in the swing states? Literally that ALONE is the margin of Biden's victory in PA and FL.
1323740385089363969 2020-11-04 05:34:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The makework bureaucrats I know have already voted. Considering I am the makework bureaucrats' servant, I know a few.
1323739741402050568 2020-11-04 05:32:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @gbadamosiwole @Barnes_Law Ask John Kerry how increased turnout worked for him. Or Walter Mondale.
1323739589677297664 2020-11-04 05:31:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HUACwasright @SelimSeesYou Fairfax turnout still hasn't matched 2016 and the rurals are getting a surge. It isn't *that* blue yet if the right electorate occurs. Of course, this is very strange as NoVA has been very engaged typically against Trump. Why the turnout is down here is anyone's guess.
1323738986016350208 2020-11-04 05:29:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou There was a Biden+5 in VA in early September/late August. Everyone trashed it as impossible.
1323738747813433344 2020-11-04 05:28:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnonTrump66 One less vote for Biden is nearly as good.
1323737283623878656 2020-11-04 05:22:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I honestly hope and pray I'm not leading you all astray. I've gotten a lot of followers over the past 6 months since I came back on Twitter. I'm just calling them as I see them. Now convince someone else to get off their ass and vote TRUMP 2020!
1323736839304450048 2020-11-04 05:20:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 Yeah, well, there's all those mail ins that supposedly voted en bloc for Biden.
1323735666170171392 2020-11-04 05:15:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @ToshJann "Slow down" means "their edge is not increasing as much every 20 minutes as it was a couple hours ago."
1323735067622019073 2020-11-04 05:13:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Dude, it’s cool bro. Win lose or draw, we are all fighting the fog of war. The media are a bunch of lying scumbags regardless of the outcome: Doesn’t mean we *should* have trusted them instead of our guys.
1323734552645406720 2020-11-04 05:11:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 2 hours 49 minutes left to go, get to the polls. Nearly 4 if you’re in the panhandle.
1323734250307391489 2020-11-04 05:10:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If Trump is winning in a single exit poll or “voter analysis” expect a landslide.
1323732547591950341 2020-11-04 05:03:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Yeah, a few tens of thousands of votes max in the rust belt. And those will be fought over tooth and nail.
1323731482603589635 2020-11-04 04:59:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnonTrump66 Yeah, my mother was doing that to us when she was in her 20s lol.
1323730567813308416 2020-11-04 04:55:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Going to be honest here: Who hasn't had their parents or grandparents call them by a sibling's or cousin's name? Don't have to be senile to do that.
1323729934536314880 2020-11-04 04:53:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark Like, if Dems aren't as interested in the election, why would left-leaning Indies be more interested? If Republicans are very interested, wouldn't right-wing Indies also be? These are related groups.
1323729748506349569 2020-11-04 04:52:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark He either needs a big crossover: Unprecedented in GOP history, or this. I would just think if either of these things were happening, they'd happen in conjunction with sky high Dem turnout too, which we're just not seeing. These things tend to go together.
1323729019427344389 2020-11-04 04:49:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @conor4341 @HeritageNLegacy @realikamusume Oh, you believe in community, name everyone in your million plus person county.
1323728876493819907 2020-11-04 04:48:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky YouGov had a majority liberal Biden+10 poll this morning.
1323726773788528644 2020-11-04 04:40:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton @SelimSeesYou Tories for Trump!
1323726086627348481 2020-11-04 04:37:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky Lots of old Dem crossover types. County profiles matter almost as much as party affiliation.
1323723266830311425 2020-11-04 04:26:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I know several of those 528,077 who checked their ballots for Trump.
1323722913674072064 2020-11-04 04:25:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @SelimSeesYou Campaigns typically underestimate themselves.
1323722087622651905 2020-11-04 04:21:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I love how all Dems assume high turnout means Dem advantage. It's literally all Republicans, men, and working class people doing the voting.
1323721791852957702 2020-11-04 04:20:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SageMccallister Lots of people are worried about PA over this. I wouldn't be, even if it were true.
1323719937731473412 2020-11-04 04:13:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiah_crawley @thehangingchads Yeah, overall turnout is down. GOP turnout is still ticking up in terms of advantage even in Florida.
1323719788917567489 2020-11-04 04:12:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I love all the people panicking about this. Literally all it means is that there's way more people who wanted to vote for Trump and RIGHT NOW than they were anticipating.
1323717388811014144 2020-11-04 04:03:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Black and Caspians Seas get their standard 3 EVs just to get the libs to eat it about "popular vote" nonsense.
1323715634212048897 2020-11-04 03:56:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @codysviews They did it last time when the Biden voters voted on EDay too. They can do it. Go to the polls!
1323714518858584065 2020-11-04 03:51:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart We're already well above where we were in 2016 after everything was set and done.
1323714048735776770 2020-11-04 03:49:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lauraka09619649 The registered party voter gap in total votes, including mail ins, was already well under what it was in 2016.
1323713105323577344 2020-11-04 03:46:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> That's just in Clark County.
1323713015590604800 2020-11-04 03:45:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf We're already well over our final gap in Nevada in 2016. Really up to those NPAs.
1323712823214673922 2020-11-04 03:45:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Democrats are like 10,000 ballots behind their advantage in 2016 and we still most of EDay left to go....
1323712601545678849 2020-11-04 03:44:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The lead is growing...
1323711958684782593 2020-11-04 03:41:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KarnatakaYankee They don't regularly dump ballots. You need to be able to match the number of ballots to number of voters by law (this goes both ways, why lazy box stuffing gets caught and indicted easy).

1323710148381167616 2020-11-04 03:34:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd Watch Trump get 50.01%.
1323709421751513088 2020-11-04 03:31:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Over 2018 advantage of 132K.
1323708328686559239 2020-11-04 03:27:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheJordanRachel Remember not to believe them.
1323707768507871233 2020-11-04 03:24:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SouthernConsDem Winning the DC primary is tantamount to election.
1323707389468659712 2020-11-04 03:23:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark Enjoyable, but always take with a grain of salt. These people are way too irrational. I've heard reports of Biden volunteers crying because they're missing their turnout goals. These people might cry over missing it by like 1%, though. That's how fragile they are about it.
1323705629349916673 2020-11-04 03:16:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed @AStratelates It's crazy. In 2006 that guy barely won in Virginia and far more liberal candidates are able to win statewide election easily.
1323705165275430913 2020-11-04 03:14:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Haven't heard any Florida updates: We still romping? JoeIsDone doesn't seem to be updating.
1323704369678852096 2020-11-04 03:11:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed @AStratelates That was the entire reason the GOP won the House back with relative ease in 2010. People didn't suddenly become progressives just because they didn't like the war and the economy went into the tank at the worst possible moment.
1323703627521937413 2020-11-04 03:08:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed @AStratelates I think people were mostly shocked by the Indiana and North Carolina flip, which most Republicans really expected to hold. Then the Republicans lost 8 Senate seats and a further bottom out in the House. Wasn't a split decision like 1996 or 2012.
1323700672618004482 2020-11-04 02:56:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates The YouGov sample definitely did: It had a plurality Liberal electorate. Never happened in modern US history. Even 2008.
1323700027538235392 2020-11-04 02:54:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Retardius2 @freunraven  https://t.co/TZuU0KIWLP
1323699871052898306 2020-11-04 02:53:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Like, if we discover that Republicans are very loyal to Trump, Dems are less loyal to Biden, and Indies break small for Trump we just have a better idea than randomly calling up people and coming up with the same top line for all sorts of random reasons.
1323699558573133828 2020-11-04 02:52:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Retardius2 @freunraven Typically D or R.
1323699437449990146 2020-11-04 02:51:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If the polls end up as far as off as seems possible right now, we need to *at least* start doing polling by in depth analysis of different voter groups instead of just randomly sampling the whole electorate. The Electorate is composed of discrete groups.
1323698331441373186 2020-11-04 02:47:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner God, I pray so hard.
1323696643707936774 2020-11-04 02:40:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is like 1% (being conservative on whose’s eligible and with 6.5 million voters) of the vote in PA and literally all of them are voting Trump.
1323696004303040514 2020-11-04 02:38:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> High turnout is bad for Democrat incumbents, not Republican ones.
1323695913349558272 2020-11-04 02:37:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BLG923 @CarlStein1984 And that’s with the record early vote. Crazy.
1323695673221488642 2020-11-04 02:36:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Peoples_Pundit I find this encouraging: Means turnout is higher than they expected and they expected high turnout.
1323695512500031488 2020-11-04 02:36:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SoccerM28488565 @thehangingchads @Peoples_Pundit He’s probably exhausted and has a long night of him.
1323694645604458496 2020-11-04 02:32:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> “Elections basically don’t matter.”  *reads history book* *it’s basically all about who’s in charge of the government*  Uh, ok.
1323693742444797952 2020-11-04 02:29:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Imagine if we get 60 million voters today and they break 40-18 (accounting for random third party) for Trump or more. Lmao. Make it happen.
1323693151958241286 2020-11-04 02:26:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 There was a 3 hour long line to vote in Bethlehem PA this morning. I don’t think they were Biden voters.
1323692523945152513 2020-11-04 02:24:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThatElectionGuy @CarlStein1984 Typical EDay shenanigans. That sounds like they're overwhelmed by just how many people are out to vote. They'll find a way to the polls.
1323692083832643588 2020-11-04 02:22:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I like how we're seeing reports of big turnout on EDay everywhere for Republicans and the doomers are worried there's fog of war in a few states. Like, if this is a national mood, it's happening there too.
1323691598912380929 2020-11-04 02:20:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThatElectionGuy @CarlStein1984 It's looking amazing. Huge GOP turnout advantage on EDay.
1323691417861033987 2020-11-04 02:20:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 Reports of long lines in PA. Most of the stuff I'm hearing so far is typical EDay shenanigans.
1323690304164270080 2020-11-04 02:15:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MonicaCfromMI @HelloTeamTrump Your elected electors, not the President. States run elections in this country, though there are Federal regulations. If you note, Trump is also on the ballot twice.
1323689627220365312 2020-11-04 02:12:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Biggest jump will happen between 4-7 according to historical patterns. Might change this year because I believe some people might have voted early when they usually vote late. I don't know, though.
1323689344880857088 2020-11-04 02:11:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 Florida:  https://t.co/uUWZDa760Z  Hearing over 50% in Arizona and Nevada too. Long lines reported in Pennsylvania.
1323689050985869315 2020-11-04 02:10:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 Republican landslide in EDay votes nationally.
1323687390821666817 2020-11-04 02:04:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MonicaCfromMI @HelloTeamTrump This is standard in New York due to Fusion Laws.
1323685867836329985 2020-11-04 01:57:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm laughing at the YouGov Biden+10 poll with more liberals than conservatives. When was the last election that happened? Ever?
1323685606661214209 2020-11-04 01:56:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SR71999 @LVB_19 Some people are weird.
1323685078636077056 2020-11-04 01:54:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SR71999 @LVB_19 I'm more concerned about crossover voters, but I won't believe it until Biden wins by 5 nationally or whatever.
1323684894581657602 2020-11-04 01:54:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @paulasport20011 @GTaroia Nope, but it only gets bigger from here. No Culinary Unions this year.
1323684774574174208 2020-11-04 01:53:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cogi2_ErgoTsun Most of this stuff sounds like typical Election Day shenanigans.
1323684416426823687 2020-11-04 01:52:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 Long lines in Atlanta or something?
1323684194619478017 2020-11-04 01:51:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GTaroia 26% Dem turnout in Las Vegas, Nevada is just like: holy shit.
1323683993687068673 2020-11-04 01:50:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Is it happening or what guys?
1323677588804567043 2020-11-04 01:25:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cogi2_ErgoTsun I suspect this is the typical shy Trumpers. Like, Republicans who approve of Trump aren’t going to defect to the tune of 1/9. Even some of the disapprovers would likely vote Trump just because they don’t like Biden: That’s more normal.
1323677235757391874 2020-11-04 01:23:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StaresInStoic Probably. Most of it is just typical Election Day shenanigans.
1323677127766646787 2020-11-04 01:23:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Would be truly bizarre.
1323676966499815426 2020-11-04 01:22:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottonTurtle9 Normally you’re right, but if the suburban trend is real, Georgia would flip while North Carolina would stay purple lean red because NC just doesn’t have as many metro suburbs (Charlotte suburbs are not metro).
1323674296548556805 2020-11-04 01:11:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SageMccallister @AirBossUT5 Student vote down 30% in Ohio.
1323674236620328960 2020-11-04 01:11:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SageMccallister @NatPresPart Return rates seem below average in big Dem counties in general. Highest is Sarasota: A traditional R stronghold. Some GOP rurals have low return rates, but they might vote in person today. Of course, so could the Democrats, but they usually don’t even without the pandemic.
1323673853885849601 2020-11-04 01:10:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 This is big. Democrats are really banking on the senior GOP desertion meme at this point.
1323673133539352581 2020-11-04 01:07:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates Florida GOP usually leads in mail in votes. They didn’t use them this year because Trump told them to vote in person and crushed In Person instead.
1323672839581478914 2020-11-04 01:06:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cogi2_ErgoTsun @KingBroly If they’re Election Day, I guarantee they’re breaking for Trump. Even Election Day Dems will have a higher crossover rate than the average Dem. My only concern is that GOP mail in defection might have been a bit high. But if it was less than 10%, it’s basically nothing.
1323670692152356864 2020-11-04 00:57:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Reminder the last St. Pete Poll had 15% GOP crossover vote: More than Biden's entire 1 point lead in the poll. They're saying Trump will lose 15% of the GOP vote even though the Florida GOP entirely shifted their voting patterns at his command.
1323669391855308801 2020-11-04 00:52:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @NatPresPart It's freedom vs. tyranny on the ballot. I hate to go all TrueCon here, but just look at these lockdowns. These people want to destroy our businesses and our lives over a virus that just isn't as bad as they're claiming. This is the world's shot to say "NO!"
1323668998127525888 2020-11-04 00:50:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart No. There was energy, but not this much. The GOP seems far more united this time too. Like, the Ben Shapiro conservative has come home. Trump still got 90% of the Republican votes. I don't see how he regresses.
1323668636230426624 2020-11-04 00:49:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SageMccallister @NatPresPart Requested mail in return rate.
1323668092673810436 2020-11-04 00:47:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart Outside Texas and California, it's basically all Republican areas turning out too. Like, I don't get how the GOP county vote share can increase this much in a landslide GOP loss. Republican crossovers would be disproportionately located in Dem or purple counties anyway.
1323667262105157637 2020-11-04 00:44:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The final return rate for mail in ballots in Broward County was 76%. Might get to 80 if the USPS rushes.
1323666462976970752 2020-11-04 00:40:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart Democrats are winning the election day vote everywhere right now outside of a narrow Dem lead in Broward. They're definitely winning EDay voters in Miami.
1323666238913024000 2020-11-04 00:39:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nc_groyp "Oh, I approve of the stuff Trump does in office, but I think he's mean, so I'm going to vote for a corrupt husk of a Democrat machine politician."   Said 5 million people? What?
1323665872188329988 2020-11-04 00:38:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart Miami will be net Democrat, but much less so than 2016.
1323665763354484738 2020-11-04 00:38:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nc_groyp The polls are bizarre: They have Trump at 95% approval with Republicans, but 85% of the vote share. That alone is like 3% of his deficit. Probably shy Trumpers if I had to bet.
1323665512270880768 2020-11-04 00:37:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sgaspari Hypocritical losers to a man.
1323664830138617856 2020-11-04 00:34:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If Democrats win this election it's on Republican votes.
1323655412860727297 2020-11-03 23:56:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you eliminate the obvious push polls, the RCP national average is more like Biden+6.
1323654456056172545 2020-11-03 23:53:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 There are rumors of an anti-Biden insurgency there over the laptop.
1323652860903608323 2020-11-03 23:46:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles Even McCain won more crossovers than Obama did. Like, Republicans just stay home when they're dissatisfied, they don't vote for leftist politicians.
1323652428168876032 2020-11-03 23:45:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FlycatcherSilky I can get being disaffected and not voting Trump, but showing up for some pathetic corrupt husk like Joe Biden because Trump sends mean tweets and a respiratory illness: Who even are you? Seriously, it's latent hypocrisy.
1323651187976097794 2020-11-03 23:40:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Sorry, but if you vote for Biden because of "decency" or whatever, IDGAF about your "principles."
1323650899827445761 2020-11-03 23:39:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dems literally praying on crossover votes. Have been for weeks.
1323650005673140224 2020-11-03 23:35:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark The exit polls didn't call a GOP win in any of the 3 past elections where a Republican won the Presidency. They also underestimated their share of the votes in every election. They're literally always tilted toward Democrats.
1323648151476228096 2020-11-03 23:28:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Maybe with a quick flip over to TYT every once in a while to drink up those sweet liberal tears.
1323642764421156867 2020-11-03 23:06:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Sarasota will be majority GOP on Election Day and Miami-Dade might this year as well.
1323637606471618561 2020-11-03 22:46:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PianistF There's a lot of bad stuff you can say about the Amish, but I'm just not a fan of leftist governments breaking up communities with long traditions over petty crap.
1323636124850524160 2020-11-03 22:40:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LVB_19 It hardly ever worked anyway.
1323636030667411458 2020-11-03 22:39:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 @JayFiveK He did three weeks ago. Mostly about money, but there was a YUGE impromptu rally alongside it.
1323635688651280384 2020-11-03 22:38:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LVB_19 Every year they try to discourage Panhandle voters by acting like Florida is done for. Definitely won't work this year when Miami-Dade doesn't dump some absurd margin.
1323634361766465537 2020-11-03 22:33:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Some fed agencies are just glorified gangs.
1323634205658669057 2020-11-03 22:32:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I'm hearing this isn't even including a few large large counties that are also seeing a surge of GOP voters.
1323633466358046724 2020-11-03 22:29:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 How many are low propensity? Any indications?
1323632781180719104 2020-11-03 22:27:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL I would, but this is a work line.
1323632264085983239 2020-11-03 22:24:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> For some reason the voter file thinks one of my numbers belongs to several (at least 3) South Carolina Democrats.
1323631828981473280 2020-11-03 22:23:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I will be watching the early reporting states for margins in different types of counties. If Trump is maintaining his margins at least in Indiana and Kentucky, then he's looking good.
1323628479590600704 2020-11-03 22:09:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This poll only had 25% voting on election day and had more voting in person early. Turnout will probably end up being 30-35% on election day. The mail in portion (40%) seems about right. Also, this poll had more liberals than conservatives, which has never been the case.
1323627003933794305 2020-11-03 22:04:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Lol: Uber is giving out discounted rides cause they’re desperate for youth votes.
1323621718531969024 2020-11-03 21:43:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I was at a Fairfax precinct. We’re normally Republican: Line was huge. 3/4 voters were taking the GOP sample ballot. The Dems looked depressed.
1323621232407941121 2020-11-03 21:41:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TywysogM @CitadelMark Yes. A lot of these states simply don’t have enough mail in ballots out either. Trump campaign is expect 2.6 million votes in PA today to 1.5 for Biden. Only need a small fraction of the mail ins need to be Trump votes if that’s the case.
1323620541308276737 2020-11-03 21:38:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark Hearing reports rural turnout is insane. Longest lines people have ever seen.
1323620373154418692 2020-11-03 21:37:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biggest polling misses happen when rural turnout is off the charts!
1323619082831335444 2020-11-03 21:32:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wizard_Predicts @realikamusume Those NPAs are definitely breaking Trump and I suspect the Dems have a higher crossover rate than those voting early on top of it.
1323617886414528514 2020-11-03 21:27:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL They are. This will get sorted out.
1323617680830681090 2020-11-03 21:27:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 I NEED MORE
1323617215296512000 2020-11-03 21:25:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We don’t let this happen in third world elections we watch.
1323616834923495426 2020-11-03 21:23:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @thehangingchads Yeah, I’m not terribly worried about it, but just want to watch it like a hawk. Need a convincing win.
1323615354942296064 2020-11-03 21:17:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TywysogM @CitadelMark That’s why they called Florida for Gore early. Bush probably would have won the popular vote as Republicans have voted late for decades.
1323612997076557824 2020-11-03 21:08:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark That’s typical. Republicans return their mail in ballots late in Florida. Democrats always think they’ve jumped out to some huge lead. It’s mostly just Republicans waiting to return it later.
1323612347320160256 2020-11-03 21:05:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CoryRob50589614 @jspencer67 @ScottPresler Wilkes-Barre, PA. Northeast: Wyoming Valley.
1323611594224472065 2020-11-03 21:02:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Anyone hear what’s going on in Philadelphia? Have they started stuffing the ballot box yet?
1323611437961543681 2020-11-03 21:02:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> ROMP
1323610888121835526 2020-11-03 21:00:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 Those are the counties where even the Dems vote GOP too lol.
1323609298333818882 2020-11-03 20:53:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dems need 40K more votes to match 2016. Same with the GOP.
1323609036869304320 2020-11-03 20:52:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I checked it out: Dems outnumbered GOP by 2:1 in Broward on Election Day in 2016. Both sides have more in the bank this time, though.
1323606916715716611 2020-11-03 20:44:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 Democrats need 40,000 votes in Broward today to match 2016.
1323606362845335552 2020-11-03 20:42:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 Such good news.
1323605263908298752 2020-11-03 20:37:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @guru_scout @FatGutKelly1 @RealAPolitics He was supposed to rebuild the resort and never did.
1323604420416966656 2020-11-03 20:34:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @SelbJim I just can’t help but think if Trump loses, there really isn’t much to do from here. Like, they’ll just ignore Trump-type candidates and they’ll never get traction.
1323604011266789377 2020-11-03 20:32:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads RCP sounds like they want to save their reputation.
1323603667115790337 2020-11-03 20:31:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim I know, but I can’t help but be uncertain.
1323602488759603200 2020-11-03 20:26:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Kane9015 Seriously. It’s why I don’t get the blasé attitude about it among some elements. It’s like: Do you not realize this means the media has complete control over our government if he loses? His policies are popular by every measure.
1323601521393733633 2020-11-03 20:22:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It’s just sad if Trump doesn’t win. He has given so much hope to Middle American communities. If college educated Whites end up delivering Biden the Presidency over this sham, I don’t even know what to think. We’ll never get a chance to finish rebuilding these communities.
1323599361297862658 2020-11-03 20:14:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @yemanouspeak It actually dropped off pretty quickly.
1323599208633503746 2020-11-03 20:13:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 He’s probably one of their better stumpers, actually. The spouses are better than the candidates on that side.
1323598873076682752 2020-11-03 20:12:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If what we’re hearing about the Election Day vote being 2.6-1.5 million votes in Pennsylvania today: It’s looking good.
1323596374039056386 2020-11-03 20:02:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis I’m confident he’ll get at least that. I worry about some long court battle should he only get that narrowly.
1323595263672504322 2020-11-03 19:57:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis That’s my map too as of right now. Most unsure of New Hampshire, though.
1323594222830845952 2020-11-03 19:53:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Bradsnel1 @BibMccafferty @realikamusume So did Romney.

1323593650295709699 2020-11-03 19:51:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis Nervous. Not going to lie, but I hope people made the right choice instead of sending in their mail in ballot before they really knew what they were voting for.
1323591337371992064 2020-11-03 19:42:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis Based on my highly scientific “who picked what sample ballot” my guess is Republicans got 75% of the vote that was just in line at least and that was hundreds of people.
1323590494493024256 2020-11-03 19:38:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> My vote for Donald Trump has been counted.
1323586634256961537 2020-11-03 19:23:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 I haven’t seen a single anti-ad. Guess they’re not particularly invested in it.
1323585508820373504 2020-11-03 19:19:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 Virginia. Republican precinct.
1323585159619366917 2020-11-03 19:17:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Lol: The Democrats in Virginia claim the anti-gerrymandering constitutional amendment is gerrymandering. Typical lies.
1323584751953989633 2020-11-03 19:16:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @Alec_Holbeck @AkwesiQuan_ Absolute max for Biden. Quite possibly 55-45 on more regular support levels.
1323583439409451008 2020-11-03 19:10:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @Alec_Holbeck @AkwesiQuan_ I think he has max 60 and Trump is set to romp today 34-12.
1323582742475452418 2020-11-03 19:08:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AkwesiQuan_ That’s my guess.
1323582291315142656 2020-11-03 19:06:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 NoVA. This is usually a Republican precinct, though.
1323581609304608771 2020-11-03 19:03:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Holy crap the line is long to vote.

1323516954246860801 2020-11-03 14:46:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @chudmost @davidchapman141 Just the total number. No results.

1323511172902080512 2020-11-03 14:23:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Local media interviews.
1323510827694084096 2020-11-03 14:22:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @35JackKennedy @Barnes_Law Fog of war and there are people betting Biden because they believe the polls.
1323510630658297856 2020-11-03 14:21:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 @Barnes_Law And W was nowhere near as loved as Trump is with the base. Part of the reason Bushies hate Trump.
1323510265883885570 2020-11-03 14:20:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law It’s just a total joke at this point.
1323508674845941760 2020-11-03 14:13:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Verb_Sap No, saying his opponents have been.
1323508540061995008 2020-11-03 14:13:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pimpisyou @KingBroly As if Democrats have earned their trust. Trump needs some help in Congress or we’re just in for 2-4 more years of constant deadlock and Trump issuing EOs that will be overturned the moment a D gets elected.
1323508104416366592 2020-11-03 14:11:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly @pimpisyou We will see tomorrow. A lot of people in these rust belt states still don’t trust Republicans.
1323507566639501314 2020-11-03 14:09:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pimpisyou @KingBroly Depends on how much ticket splitting happens in a Trump win.
1323507129295249413 2020-11-03 14:07:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> You’re voting for an old demented, senile, corrupt machine boss and all you got is tired old jokes about Trump’s hair I’ve been hearing literally my entire life.
1323506281475440640 2020-11-03 14:04:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @trajan_decius I hope the latter is it. Honestly half respect it.
1323506009034362881 2020-11-03 14:03:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CJlegalBeagle @3GHtweets @SelimSeesYou @Barnes_Law It worked back when polls were trying to do their job. I’m convinced at least half these polls are legit just push polls.
1323505006016892929 2020-11-03 13:59:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @trajan_decius It’s the entire Lincoln Project.
1323504852215959552 2020-11-03 13:58:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> YouGov push polls seem perfectly designed to show women abandoning Trump. Who do you think abandons the survey when they get a question about Trump infecting Latinos with Corona?
1323504477207408642 2020-11-03 13:57:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NickJFuentes And that’s in the YouGov push polls.

1323502652370624512 2020-11-03 13:49:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I’m skeptical...but if this is what dumps tonight, Biden’s finished. National landslide.
1323502187339796480 2020-11-03 13:48:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Reuters looking for a last minute “small” miss.

1323501532965470209 2020-11-03 13:45:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Basically.
1323501472764645376 2020-11-03 13:45:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAFoshee The owner: Les Otten, I believe.
1323501312823107584 2020-11-03 13:44:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp An LP Presidential candidate bought everyone a Reason Magazine subscription and camped out there for like a year. He got 10 votes.
1323501079129194496 2020-11-03 13:43:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Actually, what happened is the lolberts decided to harass them for years in the 90s. That, and one of these places is literally owned by this guy Les Otten who is a big time NeverTrumper: Probably don’t want to get harassed by the boss in a community with 5 voters.
1323500376872701953 2020-11-03 13:40:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ToshJann @pabloplato These communities are weird and they get pushed around a lot politically.
1323499995912425474 2020-11-03 13:39:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 True. But typically losing candidates get conciliatory at the end. Of course, Trump has always done their own thing.
1323499790068523008 2020-11-03 13:38:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 16-15 Trump so far.  Also, these northern midnight New Hampshire precincts are renowned for their lolbert weirdos. That’s why they have a bunch of NeverTrumpers (and did in 2016).
1323497570895859713 2020-11-03 13:29:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hwy41 @CottoGottfried Yo, hey, Trump was there today and some of us are really looking forward to them heckling their “hometown” boy.
1323495459994947584 2020-11-03 13:21:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This shit is even less believable than it was in 2016. I was genuinely nervous the Cruz types would stay home or otherwise throwaway their vote. Anyone think that’s happening this year? Now it’s like three Romney Republicans who are mostly embarrassed to admit it publicly.
1323494422106021889 2020-11-03 13:17:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 I mean, Biden thinks Trump is winning.
1323493658553966597 2020-11-03 13:14:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dude, Trump is talking treason. This guy is freaking all in. He believes he’s going to win, rightly or wrongly. So does Biden it seems.
1323493229728309248 2020-11-03 13:12:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly @Peoples_Pundit Speculation in 2016 was Republicans held the House and Senate that way.
1323492450258821122 2020-11-03 13:09:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump calls them suppression polls. Love this guy.
1323492017121431552 2020-11-03 13:07:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> What the Democrats are doing to this country is terrible. Just because some people dared to express dissatisfaction with Obama’s shitty term in office and want to rebuild something more like Old America.
1323489210297442304 2020-11-03 12:56:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou Just a simple fact that coups are less successful when the leader is out of town. Especially out of town in a state where his friend is the governor and controls the local organs of state power.
1323488391254736896 2020-11-03 12:53:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Personally, I'd chill in Mar-A-Lago if I were Trump. Palm Beach has a lot more friendlies in the area.
1323488007215865857 2020-11-03 12:51:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ori_Ar @PhildodaDildo @Peoples_Pundit @NateSilver538 No, this goes back to McCain. Romney's were even worse. Both Romney and McCain's internals were picking up on what Trump has tapped into, though: The WWC male voter in the rust belt hates the Democrats.
1323487170498334722 2020-11-03 12:48:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @NoctRomaRTW @AStratelates I don’t know. Somewhere. I’ve just heard Stephen Miller has a shit ton written.
1323487011047702528 2020-11-03 12:47:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 @AStratelates @NoctRomaRTW We will almost certainly take the 9th Circuit if Trump wins. That’s BIG.
1323482522181865477 2020-11-03 12:29:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PhildodaDildo @Peoples_Pundit @NateSilver538 Btw, the reason he said that is that McCain had an internal having him running behind by 6 in Pennsylvania. Like, it wasn’t that far off.
1323480600729276416 2020-11-03 12:22:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PhildodaDildo @Peoples_Pundit @NateSilver538 Nate is famous for thinking internals are trash.
1323480345946267648 2020-11-03 12:21:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @NoctRomaRTW Because screw these people it needed to be done yesterday.
1323480247698939908 2020-11-03 12:20:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Peoples_Pundit This is the most bizarre campaign of our lives whatever happens tomorrow.
1323480048758915072 2020-11-03 12:20:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @NoctRomaRTW Probably doesn’t want to cause needless controversy before the election.
1323479621648764928 2020-11-03 12:18:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @AStratelates It was actually the swamps. Supposedly a bunch of EOs are planned for the moment this thing is called.
1323478725711843328 2020-11-03 12:14:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> “We’re going to pull the plug tomorrow.” Pence.   Sounded like it was a done deal to me.
1323476721815998464 2020-11-03 12:06:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> How dare you have your own opinion.
1323474680393682945 2020-11-03 11:58:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I wonder why Trump supporters might question the legitimacy of narrow Biden wins.
1323474371722334209 2020-11-03 11:57:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They keep threatening me with a good time.
1323473503945936896 2020-11-03 11:54:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 @SelimSeesYou I believe that the genuine fence sitters didn’t vote until later, but who knows?   Also, you might think you’re solid on a choice and then something like the Biden laptop happens.
1323472557794828289 2020-11-03 11:50:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I’d blame this dumbass Election Month: How many of these people might regret their vote?
1323472311152971777 2020-11-03 11:49:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 I don’t know how you look at Biden’s angry rants and Kamala’s awkward campaigning and then look at Trump/Pence laughing all the way and you’re just like: Who looks like they’re winning?
1323470081465163778 2020-11-03 11:40:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Pence looks energized.
1323468554554007553 2020-11-03 11:34:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaleoEconomist Especially true with school boards and judges.
1323468169508507648 2020-11-03 11:32:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 If they're too friendly to Democrats (and I see what you're saying: Clinton got fewer votes than "Modeled Democrats" from 2016, Trump got 7 million more), they need A LOT of defections. Like I keep saying: I'm not buying it until I see it.
1323464387471048704 2020-11-03 11:17:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads What if turnout is crazy up, but it's a crazy amount of Trumpians on Election Day? Pray!
1323463912558395392 2020-11-03 11:16:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Don't you know that masses of Texas Republicans are voting for Biden because they hate how Trump handled Covid?
1323463426283311104 2020-11-03 11:14:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 He seems to think Texas is in the bag for Biden. At least that was the message I got.
1323462680196370432 2020-11-03 11:11:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The UC system is so corrupt and has been for 5 decades. Want to know what ruined California? Well, besides the illegals, there was also the UCs.
1323461981014249473 2020-11-03 11:08:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 I just enjoy trolling Tom "here's how Biden can still win" Bonier.
1323461503631187968 2020-11-03 11:06:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @17cShyteposter @planefag I'm estimating that nationally, at least 30 million will go to the polls tomorrow. Disproportionately in rust belt states.
1323461001937825795 2020-11-03 11:04:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @EMichaelFrens @thehangingchads My grandfather was Labor Union organizer from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I'll feel good when it reports Trump won.
1323460657036054531 2020-11-03 11:03:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There are just more White Non-College Republican men that haven't voted yet than potential Democrats.
1323460453830479872 2020-11-03 11:02:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Tom, question: Do you understand the law of diminishing returns and that there are only so many voters in the voting universe? Face facts: You need very traditional Republicans to have voted for Biden already, and they didn't.
1323460098149240832 2020-11-03 11:00:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @17cShyteposter Also, yes, the Election Day vote is going to be crazily slanted toward WWC males.
1323459899783737345 2020-11-03 11:00:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @17cShyteposter They're breaking down Texas because it's literally the only state that has positive trends for them in early voting. It's also a state they have an 8 point deficit to makeup.
1323458230350217217 2020-11-03 10:53:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @arlowe84 @davecatanese The GOP won first time voters by 1900 votes in North Carolina. A category they lost by 25000 in the EV in 2016.
1323455352713682946 2020-11-03 10:41:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @SirDowden Bigger margins matter.
1323455216461762561 2020-11-03 10:41:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @SirDowden Hmmm....perhaps. Not sure the dynamics of their prior gubernatorial race. Also, the Hispanic shift towards Trump is real and likely to be felt in New Mexico.
1323454191868805121 2020-11-03 10:37:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden Another map bro.
1323454071605518336 2020-11-03 10:36:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @SirDowden Oil.
1323453887379054592 2020-11-03 10:36:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Literally everyone with a brain could see this coming from the beginning.
1323453617135931393 2020-11-03 10:35:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads What happened to the covid social distancing protocols in the audience?
1323453331352756224 2020-11-03 10:33:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Pacific_locust Two bitches yelling at each other about who hates Trump more: One is secretly voting for Trump anyway.
1323453169259679746 2020-11-03 10:33:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SR71999 There's definitely that segment of the electorate. I believe they've already voted. They're also disproportionately located in reliable blue states. Who cares how many extra 25 year olds show up in San Francisco?
1323452446614704128 2020-11-03 10:30:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SR71999 25-30% of youth said they'd vote tomorrow: Below average for the electorate at large, which is about a third. I believe the youth that do vote tomorrow will break for Trump relative to the rest of the young vote anyway.
1323451714083692544 2020-11-03 10:27:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If Trump is reelected tomorrow, it will be the third straight Republican reelected where the Democrats expected a youth voter surge to win it for them and it just didn't happen. At least McGovern appealed to youth. Mondale, Kerry, and Biden? No.
1323450667533565952 2020-11-03 10:23:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RocketOtter @realikamusume It was such a desperate gambit in the first place: Either win big with it or just blow up in your face. Like, it's a temporary issue. Are you really going to vote for a corrupt Democrat shell of a man just because of a disease?
1323448421102080000 2020-11-03 10:14:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @realikamusume Looks like I'll have to get some of that tomorrow.
1323446092885827586 2020-11-03 10:05:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou RCP aggregate has been way more accurate than Nate's model over the years. Nate's model is a glorified poll unskewing op, but for Democrats, who are almost never underpolled nationally.
1323445623228686337 2020-11-03 10:03:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 @JayFiveK @Nicholastrad Nevadans can't be in favor of forever lockdowns. Probably why Young Nevadans aren't showing up to vote Democrats.
1323444485787975680 2020-11-03 09:58:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @Nicholastrad The late Independent Break for Trump is big there because it is a state that breaks late and is won on Indies. No Mass and Vermont buses this year. No Unis.   I still think there's an unlikely scenario where Trump gets 270 from NH and NV flipping even while losing the rust belt.
1323443956936515584 2020-11-03 09:56:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AkwesiQuan_ Yeah. They really believe they have these lifelong Florida Republicans who are just too afraid of the rona and want to spend the rest of their short lives in the basement.
1323443362532384770 2020-11-03 09:54:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Only reason Trump is losing by 1 in the St. Pete Poll is a 15% Republican Biden crossover vote.
1323443194173030401 2020-11-03 09:53:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Map brothers!
1323441567269638150 2020-11-03 09:47:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The only swing state that showed movement towards Biden today is Florida and that was because of the dumb Quinn poll with 11% not committed to either candidate the Sunday before the election.
1323441187827625984 2020-11-03 09:45:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SK90_FL @Barnes_Law You've done all you can.
1323439579530231810 2020-11-03 09:39:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChoralReave @Barnes_Law Yes. Usually Florida counties report their whole early vote count at once.
1323438798534025216 2020-11-03 09:36:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law We got less than 24 hours until Miami-Dade dumps early votes and this happens for the narrative:  https://t.co/YvNOjWw7hQ
1323435620354691079 2020-11-03 09:23:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law @realDonaldTrump Homemakers and Pastors for Trump: I thought the religious and women hated Trump? LOL.
1323434975010717698 2020-11-03 09:21:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 Every state randomly votes for opposite party Governors and Senators, though. Virginia was renowned for its "opposition party always wins the Governor's Mansion" until the rigged 2013 election.
1323433795228413954 2020-11-03 09:16:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 No, but you know how Chicago might react if Trump wins.   Or maybe Biden, because apparently Southside is "MAGA Country."
1323427210762604544 2020-11-03 08:50:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thevivafrei @BarackObama These guys must be freaking desperate.
1323426137549230080 2020-11-03 08:45:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jaden_nixon I'm going to be at the polls when they open. We'll give it our best shot, but I dare not hope.
1323425886595592192 2020-11-03 08:44:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @travis_john78 Oh, yeah, Wexton sucks. I actually don't live in her district, but I have to drive through it to vote. If that tells you how gerrymandered this place is. Of course, the Republicans did that.
1323425399905394690 2020-11-03 08:42:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @travis_john78 Dude, it's Culpeper, Spotsylvania, and Chesterfield Counties. Culpeper is the farthest north and it's not NoVA. I live here, dude. Are you talking about Wexton?
1323425002402783233 2020-11-03 08:41:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis @SelbJim There are simply more Californians, and thus more opportunities for big movements in electoral subgroups. Californians are naturally more libertarian, and thus more likely to vote for Trump out of lockdown protest or something like that.
1323424384028151814 2020-11-03 08:38:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @travis_john78 That wasn't NoVA, actually. Her district is more Middle Virginia.
1323424090154295296 2020-11-03 08:37:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @SelbJim It's 8 PM on Election Night and you hear Wolf Blitzer announce: "Massachusetts is too close to call at this hour."
1323423598250516481 2020-11-03 08:35:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @travis_john78 I mean, I'm here and I know people who have switched back to Trump from backing third party people. Also, significant elements of the Asian community around here are in on Trump.
1323423308788936707 2020-11-03 08:34:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jhc131 No. ME-1 has become too professional with Massholes.
1323423193034641409 2020-11-03 08:34:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim There's no universe where California flips and Oregon doesn't. Probably Washington too.
1323422747716915200 2020-11-03 08:32:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @travis_john78 I don't think Trump regresses any in Northern Virginia from 2016, which was already abysmal. If he wins Southern Suburbs (Chesterfield, Virginia Beach) on shy Trumpers and there's a rural turnout surge, it's a real race. Nova only has a third of the population total.
1323421544014635009 2020-11-03 08:27:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Taliaferro_98 Yeah, this guy actually has a vague chance of winning, though.
1323421424548282370 2020-11-03 08:27:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I really wanted to flip Virginia, but I think they'll print ballots in Fairfax and Richmond because the Senate race might end up closer than expected like the 2014 Gillespie-Warner race was.
1323420918069235715 2020-11-03 08:25:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW Covid isn't going to be an issue the moment Biden concedes.
1323420736501985280 2020-11-03 08:24:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Taliaferro_98 Black Senate Candidate will help Biden with rural Black turnout there.
1323420307017867266 2020-11-03 08:22:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All in on a Trump win. There's simply too much fog of war to know if this is going to be an electoral blowout or a squeaker.
1323419948706861060 2020-11-03 08:21:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dropping my final maps: My "average turnout" model:  https://t.co/Y7keottId0 My "rural surge, Biden is screwed map":  https://t.co/EfVF0GTDLT
1323413483346661377 2020-11-03 07:55:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sgaspari He was basically just noting the bimodal distribution in the polling and the fact that the enthusiasm for Trump is off the charts.
1323410478924767234 2020-11-03 07:43:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @d_purifoy02 @LuisBobby3 @RedEaglePatriot Yes
1323408797264683008 2020-11-03 07:36:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @RedEaglePatriot Yes.
1323408364387401729 2020-11-03 07:35:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @RedEaglePatriot This has been the case in all the polls for months. It’s why this whole early vote looking good for Democrats thing was nuts.
1323408098158092288 2020-11-03 07:34:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @RedEaglePatriot Yeah, they need to be winning more than 60% of the vote so far nationally. That’s a pretty tough ask looking at the “modeled Republican” number.
1323406721491099649 2020-11-03 07:28:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot They actually have been there for weeks: Pew said this a month ago in Biden+10 poll.
1323406522160943106 2020-11-03 07:27:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Lots of polls are converging on this number.
1323406100071358464 2020-11-03 07:26:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 Same. We’ve never seen anything like this bizarre race.
1323405313043795969 2020-11-03 07:23:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Brit Hume is so confused.
1323398479603970054 2020-11-03 06:55:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_Rep00_ @SelimSeesYou Emblematic of the different universes we have been living in for the past 8+ years the only seem to be diverging further.
1323395211192684544 2020-11-03 06:43:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @gildhelm @Fuckgsw2 That was the first time in over 100 years Missouri voted for the loser. It was really unexpected by most analysts.
1323394380544299010 2020-11-03 06:39:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp That's in Philadelphia, btw. I actually expect Election Day turnout in Allegheny to be for Trump, if narrowly.
1323394176176848896 2020-11-03 06:38:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 Kerry, Gore. They also though Obama was going to win by like 11 points and McCain would lose Georgia and Missouri.
1323393892323074051 2020-11-03 06:37:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Just pay attention to turnout reports in urban precincts. If it sounds light, then it's ugly for the Democrats. They need about 350K, 300K have to be election day voters, more ballots in there in order to match 2016.
1323393254310744064 2020-11-03 06:35:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnonTrump66 Well, there are several that are in the hall of shame here at this point.
1323391660408115200 2020-11-03 06:28:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Raffaus1 @ByzCat Netflix will desecrate Christopher Columbus.
1323390862261428225 2020-11-03 06:25:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaleoEconomist Iowa is still a swing state despite its large margin for Trump last time. It hasn’t voted for a losing Republican since Ford 76.
1323390274295521281 2020-11-03 06:23:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaleoEconomist The Electorate is already more red than it was in 2016 and it's only likely to get more red tomorrow.
1323386015680253953 2020-11-03 06:06:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaleoEconomist Pennsylvania and Nevada.
1323385619859595264 2020-11-03 06:04:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf @JayFiveK I agree on that point. We have moved the normies sufficiently for the moment. I think the alt right could have done a lot more if people like Spencer and Striker didn’t take control.
1323383376762515457 2020-11-03 05:55:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I hate to say it, but the dissident right ceded control of the narrative at Charlottesville. It will take a long time and probably a Democratic President to take it back.
1323382149475672064 2020-11-03 05:51:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou &gt;DC.  This guy barely represents Establishment Republicans in Arlington County across the river anymore.
1323381594997067777 2020-11-03 05:48:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Meaning they know he has likely already won.
1323380995480031237 2020-11-03 05:46:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 Yeah. I thought they’d hit 85% a couple days ago, but they’ve been lagging bad the last few days while Republicans inch up too. We won’t know until after the election as there likely will be an unusually high number delivered tomorrow as USPS does prioritize them.
1323379585493422080 2020-11-03 05:40:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 Republicans typically catch up late on this metric.

1323379169670189058 2020-11-03 05:39:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 Where are you seeing that? I assumed you’re looking at Florida. Last I checked there it was 77.3 to 78.8 for Democrats.
1323378783639003136 2020-11-03 05:37:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Democrats: This is basically fascism.
1323378555884052481 2020-11-03 05:36:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 It means YouGov and MorningConsult are FakeNews and Silver knows it.
1323378246344417280 2020-11-03 05:35:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 Yes. Many are and the GOP return rate is nearly equal to the Democrat.
1323377799491690497 2020-11-03 05:33:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics I mean, they are Bernie voters....

I think there’s a segment of Republican women who aren’t a fan of Trump’s demeanor, but that doesn’t mean they’ll vote for a corrupt Democrat husk like Biden.
1323372643983216641 2020-11-03 05:13:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Personally I’m a decent Latin dancer, so this is cool with me.
1323371871002365952 2020-11-03 05:10:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lauraka09619649 I never bought the narrative.

1323370631472271361 2020-11-03 05:05:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RadiumLovesIt @davidchapman141 Not necessarily the case. They want to be accurate.
1323370419747987456 2020-11-03 05:04:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 @HillaryClinton @JoeBiden Biden will attempt to delegitimize the results.
1323369609853079558 2020-11-03 05:01:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 He did do better among Georgia women than nationally, as you’d expect in an R+4 state that year.
1323368879964540929 2020-11-03 04:58:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 He won White women. That was the group that was really dragging him down this whole time. Men haven't wavered at all ever (except in some obvious fake news polls).
1323367736211316736 2020-11-03 04:53:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Georgia poll has Trump only behind by 5 with women. If women are rallying back to Trump nationally, which we also saw in the Seltzer poll, it's big. Trends are aligning here.
1323366303437066242 2020-11-03 04:48:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AliceTeller "I swear, the Black and youth vote was all dumped by Drumpf's goons in the postal service. Please ignore the record GOP turnout, it's an illusion, they all hate Trump!"
1323363937623093252 2020-11-03 04:38:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm being generous to Biden here:  https://t.co/mXG5TlR9yN
1323363206929256450 2020-11-03 04:35:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Iowa and Ohio? 64. I'm having fun with this.
1323363096249966599 2020-11-03 04:35:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Add Arizona and it's 60% lmao.
1323360927652208641 2020-11-03 04:26:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OfficialDavidNC He feels he's too bearish too. LOL.
1323359487282057218 2020-11-03 04:21:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat Mine will definitely happen regardless of the outcome.
1323357078585593856 2020-11-03 04:11:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim Quinn's really going to just embarass themselves like this one last ditch effort to push Biden over the edge.
1323353989430284291 2020-11-03 03:59:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The sensible thing to say for these Boards of Elections to say is "We are experiencing an unusually high amount of absentee and mail in voting, we will endeavor to count the votes as quickly and fairly as possible." Nothing else is legitimate.
1323351528321748992 2020-11-03 03:49:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sgaspari Will release tonight. Probably around 9 PM.

1323351384692056064 2020-11-03 03:48:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 Probably tonight.
1323349527643017216 2020-11-03 03:41:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Someone needed to recover the collapse today.
1323349225959247872 2020-11-03 03:40:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> No one can stop this train.
1323348784961736704 2020-11-03 03:38:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump up to 219 in No Toss Ups.
1323344433505554432 2020-11-03 03:21:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 @BrianSh86084519 I think that one is a bit more balanced. I knew Karens in school. Not sure if I knew a Janet or Nancy.

1323343275303096325 2020-11-03 03:16:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 Janets are like 67% for Trump.
1323340258327625732 2020-11-03 03:04:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TennentsPlease Positive insurgents eventually win favor when they understand the rules and become a proper part of the coalition.
1323332966035181568 2020-11-03 02:35:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @gildhelm It would be extremely unusual for these people not to show up, in other words. These are the people that march to the polls and dutifully vote Republican even when McCain was going down to a crushing defeat.
1323332672664571906 2020-11-03 02:34:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @gildhelm The number he is talking about is that Democrats only have about 200K "super" and "frequent" voters left. Republicans have at least a million. Nets 800K. Plus you always get random low propensity voters even in a bad year.
1323332085038370816 2020-11-03 02:32:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 To be fair, if I was him, I'd underpromise and overdeliver.
1323331158843772930 2020-11-03 02:28:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think he's being coy. It's going to be like 2+ million in PA.
1323329681421148165 2020-11-03 02:22:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DKaiserjager PA his lead has collapsed two points and that's with the Rasmussen Biden+4 in that state. Will edge back up a bit as when the Marist poll, but not much.
1323328927524409345 2020-11-03 02:19:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biden's lead collapses in the RCP average of battlegrounds further. Pollmagedon approaching for Dems as more non-push polls are released.
1323328336060420097 2020-11-03 02:17:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly Even Marist is down to a 5 point race in Pennsylvania.
1323328064986730496 2020-11-03 02:16:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago I like how Colorado is blue even here because of the dude, weed crowd.
1323326039884550151 2020-11-03 02:08:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I can’t believe I’m so optimistic about tomorrow given what the “data” shows. Who cares anymore? All we gotta do is get people to the polls like they promised and this thing is ours. We will see record turnout alright: Of Republicans defending their President.
1323325495505752064 2020-11-03 02:05:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 You forgot to bump White Non-College to like 60%.
1323324228612083713 2020-11-03 02:00:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TennentsPlease Ryan is a perfect representation of why your local GOP County Chairman can't stand populist insurgents. Just always finding something to complain about, even at the post-convention party.
1323323681943261187 2020-11-03 01:58:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 Maine is a harder lift this time because Portland is more college educated now.
1323323564058136577 2020-11-03 01:58:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WesfromF What are you talking about? Republicans lead on the key early vote indicators: They actually have a huge edge over where they were in terms of first time voters last time.
1323321280393891841 2020-11-03 01:49:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW 30 is still a Trump win IMO. 40 is Virginia flips territory.
1323320920816103426 2020-11-03 01:47:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> A real turn out surge could see as high as 40 million. If that happens, it’s going to be ugly for Democrats.
1323320335219986434 2020-11-03 01:45:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I believe at least 30 million more Non-college Whites will vote tomorrow, breaking heavily for Trump.
1323318552787640320 2020-11-03 01:38:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 This is the first cycle they’ve done state polling. I think they’re just bad at it.
1323317684143095808 2020-11-03 01:34:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> “Hey, you know how you make all your money, I’m going to actively punish you after a terrible year for your industry, isn’t it great?”
1323317484330586115 2020-11-03 01:34:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I like how we’re still on about Blue Texas after Biden’s oil comments. Like, he’d probably lose the state based on that alone. Their only prayer is they had banked enough NeverTrumpers by then. I could see Harris County flipping Republican on that alone.
1323315058483568643 2020-11-03 01:24:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Counties with the highest mail return rates in Florida are those that more likely have crossover Dems and NPAs breaking for Trump: Broward, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach all below state average. Sarasota? 89%.
1323313142257065984 2020-11-03 01:16:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Sabato is more than just a dumbass poll reader. Dem stooge? Yes. Poll reader? No.
1323312945254797312 2020-11-03 01:16:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 @Barnes_Law Yeah: Not buying that either. I'm predicting Trump win.
1323312499362570240 2020-11-03 01:14:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StaresInStoic Yes. This is exactly what the polls missed in 1948 too.
1323312190007480321 2020-11-03 01:13:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> *pols
1323312051280875520 2020-11-03 01:12:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Lots of American polls are, in fact, guilty of aiding the IRA. Basically any Irishman in Congress in the 1980s.
1323311047160303617 2020-11-03 01:08:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law That's more reasonable than these psychos predicting Biden 400+ EVs.
1323310841161256961 2020-11-03 01:07:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Men: Deliver the same polling error that delivered Harry Truman the White House. The stage is all set for a magnificent day tomorrow. All that's left to do is deliver the huge Election Day victory we said we would.
1323310016376483844 2020-11-03 01:04:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 They have him losing PA by 4 today.
1323309581989236736 2020-11-03 01:02:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joshualucas @CantusLaudanum Same. Especially because PA and TX have a lot of juice left in the rurals.
1323309243383107586 2020-11-03 01:01:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Rasmussen state polls are all over the map lol.

1323308437313331202 2020-11-03 00:58:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CantusLaudanum Trump wins Pennsylvania and holds the Red Wall and wins the election.
1323307701754044418 2020-11-03 00:55:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Rural share of the vote is up 2.3% in the Battlegrounds compared to final early vote in 2016. Suburban down .4% and Urban down 1.9%.
1323307174177710080 2020-11-03 00:53:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @drump_donny @RealAPolitics You know how many Republicans didn't vote in 2016 because they were turned off by Trump? A lot. They're voting this time. And it's not because they like basement Biden.
1323306548496683009 2020-11-03 00:50:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @drump_donny @RealAPolitics You know the last two elections where a Republican was re-elected President were on higher turnout, right? Simple fact is that this electorate is far more favorable than the 2016 electorate was for Republicans so far by every metric.
1323305867618459648 2020-11-03 00:47:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @drump_donny @RealAPolitics The Republicans lead by 2,000 among first time voters in North Carolina. They lost this category by 25,000 in the early vote last time and still won the state.
1323305442102124545 2020-11-03 00:46:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Republicans have a 2,000 first time registered voter advantage in North Carolina in the early vote. The Democrats led by 25,000 in this category in 2016 and still lost the state.
1323304096015781889 2020-11-03 00:40:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DominionLad Also had a big move to Trump among women and Indies. Lots of polls are showing this. There's basically two separate polling universes right now.
1323303469911052291 2020-11-03 00:38:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @drump_donny @RealAPolitics First time voters are down 3.1% as a share of the electorate so far. Youth turnout is looking average at most. Where's this record Turnout?
1323301433152884738 2020-11-03 00:30:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 That and I think they're oversampling Postgrads among college grads.
1323301347131822080 2020-11-03 00:30:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I like the Democrats acting like Iowa isn't a bellwether because it went huge for Trump last time. So far, since 2000, it has voted Democrat in 3/5 elections and the only two times a Republican has won it, they won the election. It's a bellwether of the White vote nationally.
1323299894757646336 2020-11-03 00:24:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Checking it out: The final 2016 numbers had a lot of numbers converging on 51-55% White vote too. It ended up being 57. Main difference is that Clinton’s share was lower too.
1323298678610796545 2020-11-03 00:19:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @shuggabumfairy The NeverTrumper’s biggest stronghold is NoVA. If enough of them come home, it’s possible. This Commonwealth is basically two different states now, though.
1323298360967766017 2020-11-03 00:18:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @uhhhhhhhhhhhuh That’s more reasonable than the wignat narrative.
1323297791322562565 2020-11-03 00:15:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @shuggabumfairy Trump will need a very strong turnout tomorrow. I think it will be closer than most think, but it’s such a heavy lift.
1323297637328736257 2020-11-03 00:15:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @drump_donny @RealAPolitics Trump got record blowout turnout in the R primaries and got 94% of the vote. The opposition did field a candidate. Where were they? Also, Trump has like 95% approval among Republicans. Keep dreaming.
1323296375283556352 2020-11-03 00:10:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 There's also the question of just how real the White College vote collapse is. Baris seems to think a lot of it is lumping BAs in with Postgrads and not realizing BAs don't vote anything like Postgrads. Combined, a huge polling miss is possible among Whites.
1323294812276166660 2020-11-03 00:04:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnonTrump66 I mean, if they voted for McCain to the tune of 55%, I don't think they're not voting for Trump because he isn't gung ho enough on immigration.
1323293695018475521 2020-11-02 23:59:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All the polls have pretty much converged on a White vote collapse for Trump and I'm just not going to buy Trump will have the worst White GOP vote numbers since Bob Dole.
1323293371583049728 2020-11-02 23:58:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 @RealAPolitics Take Stage 4 TDS people with a grain of salt either way. They're literally insane. Biden could be getting 1% less than what they wanted and some will have a mental breakdown. That said, this is consistent with everything we're hearing. We will know soon enough and I'm optimistic.
1323292336768618505 2020-11-02 23:54:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 @RealAPolitics He could mean they're behind their targets, which everyone seems to recognize. If Trump gets so much as 40% of the vote in Miami-Dade, Florida is done for the Democrats.
1323292147219652608 2020-11-02 23:53:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @drump_donny @RealAPolitics There is such a thing as a crossover vote. I wouldn't dismiss them because you'll need them to win the election based on current turnout.
1323290891029745666 2020-11-02 23:48:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 @CarlStein1984 I think Trump will get more votes than Obama did in 2008. Which will be the real clincher for these Dems.
1323289618561859588 2020-11-02 23:43:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biden's national lead has collapsed 1.5 points since you woke up yesterday.
1323289466669355010 2020-11-02 23:42:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @CarlStein1984 @LVL1776 @Emperor_of_PA @RED_IN_PA If Big Data Poll, Susquehenna, Trafalgar, AtlasIntel, Des Moines Register, Rasmussen, and IBD at this point all end up calling the results, how will the media cope?   Only 4/6 of those are partisan outfits at all, and even partisan outfits have incentives to be right.
1323287152843759616 2020-11-02 23:33:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OfficialDavidNC Especially since we know Castizo Futurism is more than a meme now.
1323286804053843969 2020-11-02 23:32:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Based.
1323285944963862534 2020-11-02 23:28:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> That's including the trash push polls YouGov and Reuters put out.
1323285706521956353 2020-11-02 23:27:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> He's only .4% behind his 46% average on February 4, 2017.
1323285326920622080 2020-11-02 23:26:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump's approval in RCP is the highest it has ever been outside the pandemic and two weeks after he took office.
1323284398813433856 2020-11-02 23:22:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GanleyShah @togreatness777 @realikamusume I agree. I'm also of the opinion Democrats simply don't have enough requests out. Philly will need to do old school ballot box stuffing and that's harder than this mail in "10 days after the election" crap.
1323284151315898368 2020-11-02 23:21:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IVMiles We all whiff on sometimes. No mere mortal bats a 1.000.
1323283757034622976 2020-11-02 23:20:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 That was the big x-factor with this race from day 1. Easy to see a ton of people telling pollsters they're going to vote Biden just to express their displeasure with Trump's antics, only to vote for Trump because they agree with his policies. Like I've been saying: Reverse Obama
1323282344783073282 2020-11-02 23:14:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 That's even better.
1323281977500442624 2020-11-02 23:13:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 VOTE!
1323281637271052289 2020-11-02 23:11:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 Trafalgar thinks they’re Biden voters who just won’t end up voting. That happens: Get cold feet and don’t end up actually voting. If that happens, plus a Trump indie shift, plus GOP turnout surge, red wave incoming.
1323281281229164544 2020-11-02 23:10:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LVB_19 This stuff just isn’t statistically possible. You expect one or two outliers both directions, but we basically have two different polling universes.
1323280614167109633 2020-11-02 23:07:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cogi2_ErgoTsun @ichancayanan I'm still hoping Texas is mostly a meme at this point.
1323280146393190401 2020-11-02 23:05:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LVB_19 Everyone with a shred of honesty knew this was inevitable at the last minute. I just can't believe the media is still pushing out these ridiculous push polls.
1323278988626792451 2020-11-02 23:01:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Every honest poll seems to have indies breaking for Trump at the last minute big.
1323278897237164034 2020-11-02 23:00:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biggest news: "Trump holds a narrow 2-point edge among independent voters, 46%-44%, the IBD/TIPP presidential poll suggests. Until Sunday, Biden had led among independents for 20 straight days."
1323278495162765313 2020-11-02 22:59:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ichancayanan With California and New York's likely margins, it's just hard for Trump to make up that margin. Who knows, though. If there is a shy Trump vote even honest polls can't detect, this might be a big break.
1323277279737356291 2020-11-02 22:54:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brettbjj_brett He has a serious shot of winning Lackawanna, though. He only lost by 3 points in 2016 and Baris had it moving bigly in his direction.
1323277080692477956 2020-11-02 22:53:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Honestly, it's worse than communism. Communists don't prevent you from having beers at the bar with your buddies after work on Friday.
1323276915181047808 2020-11-02 22:52:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Uh, IBD is at Biden 48.8%-Trump  45.6% Was at Biden+7 as late as Friday.
1323276517951066117 2020-11-02 22:51:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnonTrump66 @OfficialDavidNC We will know by the results in Georgia suburbs pretty early in the night. If those are at the same level they were in 2016 or maybe a couple points either way, the whole thing was a total meme.
1323275850800898048 2020-11-02 22:48:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Also, RCP hasn't even posted Trafalgar PA yet.
1323275734350286849 2020-11-02 22:48:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Biden's national lead has collapsed by 1.3 points just in the past 24 hours.
1323274900828729344 2020-11-02 22:44:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnonTrump66 @OfficialDavidNC Hopefully this is just the shy Trump vote. It seems crazy they'd have have shifted 20 points against Trump in 4 years.
1323273716206342145 2020-11-02 22:40:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump is going to win Biden's "hometown" and it's beautiful. It is the Scranton vs. Wall Street election, Joe, and guess who you are?
1323273289989541890 2020-11-02 22:38:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OfficialDavidNC GOP is going to need New Jersey + Illinois to be back on the map for them to compensate for the fact Texas looks to be a battleground in the extremely near future.
1323272731450888197 2020-11-02 22:36:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @togreatness777 @realikamusume Trump already has lawyers crawling around Philly.
1323272584079773699 2020-11-02 22:35:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 We all should pray he does. I'm hoping we here reports of short lines at urban precincts like we have been for most of the early voting period.
1323272233603768320 2020-11-02 22:34:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GodEmperorKek @LuisBobby3 Even in a national Biden landslide, he's going to get Florida by max 4%. Max.
1323271500812767232 2020-11-02 22:31:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All I'm saying is that you'd make more money betting on Trafalgar polls than Nate Silver's model. I'm just saying.
1323268419718963201 2020-11-02 22:19:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @kwamurai @QuasLacrimas It was weird when we first heard about the Hunter-Haille Biden hookup. Now that we know who Hunter is, you're just left going like "wtf?"
1323268091141410816 2020-11-02 22:17:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnnysobieski The lolbert-populist crossover of the Trump GOP is so bizarre sometimes.
1323267363228258305 2020-11-02 22:14:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 We know how many votes are outstanding there. If Trump hits his numbers, it doesn't matter if they find every random Democrat ballot sitting in some trash can somewhere to mark for Biden.
1323266339998441474 2020-11-02 22:10:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BorealReinhard The shifts are low enough to be statistical noise.
1323265581055905794 2020-11-02 22:07:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Look, guys, just push Trump over 3 million vote in Pennsylvania and end this crap.

1323264576025206786 2020-11-02 22:03:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rubatirabbit1 How Josephs are voting for Biden just because his name is Joe?
1323261287195959297 2020-11-02 21:50:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark I keep pointing out that it has a Bimodal distribution: A statistical impossibility. Someone’s doing the fake numbers.
1323260988083363840 2020-11-02 21:49:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Lmao at this chart.  https://t.co/ACef26UHvT
1323260812560138240 2020-11-02 21:48:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark Just look at the trend chart: It’s going up, up, up for Trump except when some crazy suppression poll is dumped. Basically eliminate one of the suppression polls in each state and he’s ahead of where he was in 2016.
1323257729637584897 2020-11-02 21:36:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The most reliable Democrat voters.
1323130333420834817 2020-11-02 13:10:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Very observant I see. Impressive.

1323122789075865602 2020-11-02 12:40:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SR71999 I honestly think half or more these polls are push polls at this point. They’re not “data.” Bimodal distributions shouldn’t happen in polling and that’s what we’re seeing, though one side obviously has a higher number of polls. It’s pretty clear that both sides are dug in too.
1323121992757874690 2020-11-02 12:37:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @furioustheguy @AirBossUT5 I assume that the Republicans would keep the House.
1323120606943023117 2020-11-02 12:31:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FlycatcherSilky Dukakis was a Governor and I mean, no one was going to beat Reagan.   Long time Senators are total Ls for sure, though. I mean, that problem goes back to like Henry Clay. Everyone thinks they’re a cringe striver.
1323119685936754695 2020-11-02 12:28:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Libs complaining there’s not enough variance in the polling lol.

1323118043422167040 2020-11-02 12:21:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 Florida is always close, but yeah, I think Trump’s team feels confident. Only going back to Florida to run up the excitement and margins in Miami-Dade.
1323117832960380933 2020-11-02 12:20:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 Illegal aliens have been ruining California elections since 90s.
1323117641981173761 2020-11-02 12:20:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Assuming Biden loses, I’m just going to laugh whenever a challenging party puts up a Bob Dole, John Kerry, Mitt Romney, or Joe Biden up as their challenger. Total jokes.
1323116888495448065 2020-11-02 12:17:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> “These pollsters have a different idea of who the electorate will be.” Funny how random people with some gut instinct have been able to figure this out.
1323114629153906689 2020-11-02 12:08:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Even Tom Bevan is on FNC noticing the bimodal polling distribution.
1323112107420897282 2020-11-02 11:58:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago @RealAPolitics I hear they’re likely Biden. All the hicks have finally come around to the cultural superiority of New York media elites.
1323108693433634826 2020-11-02 11:44:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Same with Arkansas.

1323105347863826433 2020-11-02 11:31:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @usquequo_domine @thehangingchads This is a new order that will probably get overturned.
1323104940538187777 2020-11-02 11:29:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cogi2_ErgoTsun @callmeMcDowell Iowans strike me as the type of people who would think the secret ballot is sacred.
1323103424938999809 2020-11-02 11:23:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @callmeMcDowell @Cogi2_ErgoTsun That Iowa poll had 5% who refused to answer who they were voting for.
1323102859278327809 2020-11-02 11:21:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @callmeMcDowell @Cogi2_ErgoTsun I tend to think the suburban Trump voter is the shy Trump voter. Then there's a rural Trump voter that just isn't polled at all. Hoping this is right. We will know on Tuesday.
1323102605019697154 2020-11-02 11:20:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "White people have abandoned Trump!"  Also this:
1323101281293131778 2020-11-02 11:15:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JoelLoren1 @JayFiveK "Republicans pounce!"
1323100846767382535 2020-11-02 11:13:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @Cogi2_ErgoTsun Trump still won Tarrant and most of the big suburban counties in the state, if on receded margins. The narrative on this is the suburbs have broke a further 10-20 points against Trump: I'm just not buying, like I've said.
1323098565359640577 2020-11-02 11:04:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cogi2_ErgoTsun Nevada and Arizona suburbs are Western: Which tend to behave more like Northern suburbs than Southern ones, though there are Southern influences as well.  The narrative on blue Texas and Georgia is that suburban Texans and Georgians have abandoned Trump. I have my doubts.
1323098078224809984 2020-11-02 11:02:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @17cShyteposter @QuasLacrimas They've got to be seeing what we're seeing when we notice that these people just aren't showing up for Biden. Why risk turning off swing voters on the eve of the election otherwise?
1323096065692893186 2020-11-02 10:54:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It is possible that Southern suburbs have shifted against Trump while Northern suburbs haven't. Would portend the GOP eventually become the party of the rural states and the industrial North again. Would explain an unexpectedly tight contest in GA and TX during a national win.
1323093360740081664 2020-11-02 10:43:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume The rally I was at was totally astroturfed: Most of the people wouldn't have been there were it not for all of us getting bused there and excused from class.
1323092551663046656 2020-11-02 10:40:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Half the size of Trump's and with far less frequency.   Also, I was at a Romney Rally the day before the election. It wasn't that enthusiastic. Wasn't in Pennsylvania, though.
1323089684009013248 2020-11-02 10:28:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp The advantage the big city striver has is in saving for retirement, but the higher tax burden removes that edge because this is marginal.
1323089028091183113 2020-11-02 10:26:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 Yeah, I kept trying to point out how this was basically a burden transfer to wealthy urban centers and away from your local guy who owns a small business and maybe a few rental units.
1323088755843104769 2020-11-02 10:25:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Reverse that: the burden went to blue state professionals from small business owners.
1323088545985318913 2020-11-02 10:24:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp The whole tax plan was basically a tax burden shift from blue state professionals to small business owners in Middle America.
1323087903271112706 2020-11-02 10:21:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The entire Democrat campaign is one big lie.
1323086962555760640 2020-11-02 10:18:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The election if the White Working Class all showed up (even if the White College swung against Trump huge): Here's my 2020 election map using @CookPolitical and @NBCNews's Demographic Swingometer  https://t.co/CW5dQiP4xX
1323083928702472193 2020-11-02 10:06:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Baba9773 @GallopingGhos11 Early on you could attribute it to that, but now things have evened out and this kind of turnout isn't unprecedented.
1323079120784412673 2020-11-02 09:46:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jacobladder13 @ScottMGreer Gore won it by 2% in 2000. It's not as blue as it used to be.
1323076709034450951 2020-11-02 09:37:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @BibMccafferty 80-20 on turnout down by 20% (or even 85-15) is a massive blow to Democrats. That's like 2% of their national margin by itself.
1323076258557808642 2020-11-02 09:35:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I thought it was an aberration, and so did most pollsters for a long time as it isn't that weird to show some Blacks flirting with voting for a Republican only to have them either not vote or flip back. Trump's support is real in the Black and Latino communities.
1323071215947386880 2020-11-02 09:15:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 Their bet is they either have enough in the bank or they just don’t and are trying to save themselves from embarrassment.
1323070221993807883 2020-11-02 09:11:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Both Biden and Harris have made significant hard left statements today. My interpretation: They’re trying to drive out the base, which isn’t showing up. Will it be enough?
1323066368028266496 2020-11-02 08:56:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 White men: 33% of the electorate. White women: 41% of the electorate.  Rookie numbers, dudes. We need to get those numbers up.
1323065979493093377 2020-11-02 08:54:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon Yeah, I'm just not going to buy that there's this massive genteel revolt amounting to 4-5% of the White electorate when they say they approve of the President.
1323065098609577991 2020-11-02 08:51:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Interesting note about the Democracy Institute Poll: They had Trump at 53% among White voters, but 57% approval. 57% would be a far more typical share of the White vote for a Republican candidate to get post-2000. Last Republican to get less than 55% of the White vote was Dole.
1323064063010709504 2020-11-02 08:47:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @RealAPolitics MSP itself cannot deliver enough votes to overwhelm huge turnout and margins in the rest of the state. MSP+Suburbs might if they break huge against Trump. I'm not convinced the suburbs will end up any worse than 2016.
1323062475487694854 2020-11-02 08:40:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Consider a lot of the blue dots to the North and East on that map are voting for Trump.
1323061785159782401 2020-11-02 08:38:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer Cookie polls are more real than mail in ballots.

1323041619713642496 2020-11-02 07:17:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 2/2 The Democrats, as of now, are entirely dependent on traditional Republican voters to deliver the insane margins the polls are predicting in some cases. I will not believe that's what has happened until I see it.
1323041369858985984 2020-11-02 07:16:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Here's my assessment of the state of the race:  1. Trump is closing strong. I think everyone can see that. 2. Biden is closing weak.  3. Several media outlets appear to have decided to pump out push polls through to the very end.   It's nerve wracking to say the least. 1/2
1323040358842904587 2020-11-02 07:12:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KMGVictoria Usually in the early morning hours past the election and you usually get a feel for how the night will go pretty early on. 2004: Everyone knew Bush would win by about 11. The question was whether Pennsylvania, Ohio, or Wisconsin would put him over the top.
1323036595738628102 2020-11-02 06:57:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This isn't statistically possible. Someone is extremely wrong in their assumptions.
1323036124445630466 2020-11-02 06:56:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Khanscott @BeigeShiba They're trying to meme it into not happening twice.
1323034725594894336 2020-11-02 06:50:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MarcheseJack @RedEaglePatriot 4.6 million outstanding. Democrat returns have been slowing lately too.
1323034040975400961 2020-11-02 06:47:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @durnkest @SelimSeesYou Yeah, between the two are ~14/22 million. The rest of them are at a pretty normal return rate.
1323028622786007040 2020-11-02 06:26:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Those are mostly in California.
1323028161530089479 2020-11-02 06:24:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @jhc131 @CottoGottfried They did change their methodology on the PopVote.
1323028057335226370 2020-11-02 06:24:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jhc131 @NoctRomaRTW @CottoGottfried I think they expected NV and NH to go for Trump and WI to go for Clinton. Arguable NH was stole and NV the GOP tends to get overestimated because it's hard to quantify the Strip Union workers voting as a bloc and getting bused to the polls.
1323026279151640576 2020-11-02 06:17:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jhc131 @NoctRomaRTW @CottoGottfried They got the EC right, though. A lot of people underestimated how many votes would come out of California or New York.
1323017207320846338 2020-11-02 05:40:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AmericaFirst29 @AkwesiQuan_ @RealAPolitics  https://t.co/GBBUozEgLl
1323016992052445189 2020-11-02 05:40:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @neoconscringe @AkwesiQuan_ @RealAPolitics Actually the largest age group is those aged 50-64.
1323016016130117632 2020-11-02 05:36:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Peoples_Pundit @realDonaldTrump I think there are three potential sources of shy Trumpers that not even you would be able to detect: Suburban college educated Whites, particularly those who identify as Christian is the largest potential for a shocker on the night of the election.
1323010234286284803 2020-11-02 05:13:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TarienCole @Verb_Sap Yeah. I’m not worried about it. Democrats didn’t get enough requests. Especially with a 85-90% return rate.
1323009722723741699 2020-11-02 05:11:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Interpretation:  Now that I’ve got whatever swing voters will vote for me, I’m desperately trying to excite some base voters who aren’t showing up.
1323007740239896576 2020-11-02 05:03:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Republicans will cruise past Democrats on Election Day in Florida.
1323005074046623746 2020-11-02 04:52:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These people are so irresponsible. Most of the vote in PA will be cast on Election Day.
1323003459231240193 2020-11-02 04:46:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ClassicalTheis Yeah. This particular number has been driving me nuts because it makes absolutely zero sense.
1323000359103668227 2020-11-02 04:34:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @baalwark @MeldEndCastles My understanding is the only Republicans voting by mail in PA are older and concerned about the coronavirus. Based on returns, this seems to pan out.
1322998305136271361 2020-11-02 04:25:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MeldEndCastles I expect that’s a bunch of their plans then on the GOP side. Who knows with Dems.
1322997917532246018 2020-11-02 04:24:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think Democrats will get between 85 and 90% return rate in PA in mail ins. Currently at 80.8%. Republicans are lagging behind: Anyone know if those folks would be able to vote in person on Election Day if they don’t return their ballot?
1322996397235458048 2020-11-02 04:18:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CatholicEcon The fact they’re still expecting Trump to romp Election Day by 70-30: How bad is it really? Like, if he does that or better, then it’s freaking over.
1322995020971036675 2020-11-02 04:12:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 The Democrats live in a delusional alternative universe where the media is uber pro-Trump.
1322991124940791810 2020-11-02 03:57:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads That’s more people than voted for him in that county in 2016.
1322990781062356995 2020-11-02 03:55:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wandlearner I suppose not.
1322988957429366784 2020-11-02 03:48:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SageMccallister @NoctRomaRTW @thehangingchads Democrats want to count every random naked ballot that was in a mailbox sometime around Election Day.
1322988579409268736 2020-11-02 03:47:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnonTrump66 They’re from the rural South and they’re hitting 80.
1322988147224027144 2020-11-02 03:45:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer To be fair, Biden has always been legendary for his gaffes.
1322986003775299585 2020-11-02 03:36:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @thehangingchads Like, Florida is running its standard election. Why would it take any longer than it normally would to call it if Biden is winning in such a huge blowout?
1322985386151391238 2020-11-02 03:34:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I’m sick of this crap. I don’t care how many push polls put Biden 50 points ahead.
1322981715984457732 2020-11-02 03:19:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Do you feel 10 points ahead?
1322980640636260353 2020-11-02 03:15:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Corona has possibly really impacted polls. There are these corona mole people who barely leave their house and it’s genuinely possible they’re just being overpolled.
1322980000111464453 2020-11-02 03:13:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 @Rajbrown1 Either the Trump camp is completely delusional or Biden’s ready to get roasted. Biden’s team behaves like Trump’s. Ohio seems to be a last minute Hail Mary.
1322979281933316103 2020-11-02 03:10:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rajbrown1 @Fuckgsw2 Clinton was in Ohio the day before the election.
1322979067365392389 2020-11-02 03:09:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So it sounds like most of the real campaign energy is being spent in Pennsylvania.
1322978162846912513 2020-11-02 03:05:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @billsretpal I have watched those as well! They’re great!
1322977973197279238 2020-11-02 03:05:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This poll shows exactly what I’ve been saying. For this to be right, Biden needs north of 20% Republican defection among early voters considering some of the indies and Dems voted for Trump for whatever random reason. Just assigning Trump the modeled Republicans and it’s a tie.
1322977420031467520 2020-11-02 03:02:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Can’t barrage the Farage!
1322975844558622720 2020-11-02 02:56:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Romney was in Pennsylvania the night before 2012. He lost it by 5.
1322975688853475334 2020-11-02 02:55:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thatbrian I guess we will see it on Tuesday. I’m not even seeing it here in Fairfax County. Trump is still getting high 70s of religious right voters too.
1322975397605183488 2020-11-02 02:54:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Yesterday he was in Michigan with Obama and the day before he was in Minnesota. Totally a campaign on the attack.
1322974981299601410 2020-11-02 02:53:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thatbrian You think Trump will lose the suburbs by 30 more points than 2016? Seems crazy to me.
1322974812516605952 2020-11-02 02:52:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan One reason I’m not worried about Texas at all is that Trump isn’t even going there on the pretense of rallying for Cornyn (who appears to be in zero trouble).
1322973959122550786 2020-11-02 02:49:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon The only Johnson defectors I know from 2016 are voting Trump this year.
1322973488274169860 2020-11-02 02:47:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These polls show wild suburban swings against Trump. Does anyone believe a 30 point shift happened in the suburbs?
1322972982868848640 2020-11-02 02:45:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Three potential sources of un or falsely polled Trump supporters: 1. Suburban metro college Whites (men and women), particularly those who identify as Christians. 2. Angry old people. 3. Rural voter surge.
1322972290435481601 2020-11-02 02:42:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CelticRoman8 @italiantrumper1 I meant more that I don’t think seniors are actually defecting the way polls sometimes indicate.
1322971942568296449 2020-11-02 02:41:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Probably because Montana isn’t in contest dummies.
1322971230551576576 2020-11-02 02:38:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 Yeah, the danger isn’t the 85+ crowd. It’s the 65-85 crowd who haven’t come to grips with their mortality.
1322970394085728256 2020-11-02 02:34:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 @CelticRoman8 Yeah, it just doesn’t seem to match reality.
1322970216977104899 2020-11-02 02:34:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just personally don’t know any older white people that concerned about the coronavirus. My grandparents are longtime partisan Republicans (one even voted Goldwater), but their friends don’t seem to care either.
1322969618135351297 2020-11-02 02:31:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SavingALegacy @Peoples_Pundit X factor is early voters.
1322968516769812483 2020-11-02 02:27:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The narrative of a Biden win is that enough White seniors defected to Democrats for two reasons: 1. Trump’s temper, sealed by his 2. Response to coronavirus.  I’m just not going to buy it until I see it.
1322962405664710659 2020-11-02 02:03:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JurisNaturalism Wisconsin doesn’t separate in person and mail I don’t think.
1322960722599489537 2020-11-02 01:56:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 Florida is younger lol
1322960546547773448 2020-11-02 01:55:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation Watch Florida’s ex-felon voting law backfire.
1322960201344045058 2020-11-02 01:54:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 Just looked it up: it’s matching with 2016 so far. Apparently Wisconsin is full of oldies.
1322957569862869010 2020-11-02 01:43:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I don’t even know what is going on with the Biden campaign anymore
1322956215744368643 2020-11-02 01:38:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago I wouldn’t bet the farm on it, that’s for sure.
1322950695327322113 2020-11-02 01:16:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ArtaxAbraxas It’s basically NoVA vs Old Dominion. If anything, the rest of the state is more Republican than it was before.
1322950142832611329 2020-11-02 01:14:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There are more first time registered Republicans who have voted in North Carolina. Democrats has a 20K advantage overall in this category in 2016.
1322946108411306005 2020-11-02 00:58:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ArtaxAbraxas We will give it our best shot, man.
1322942788808396803 2020-11-02 00:45:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DilwrAli The future is always uncertain, but I just don’t find it likely at this point.
1322941456361922571 2020-11-02 00:39:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DilwrAli Very well could.
1322940711424188416 2020-11-02 00:36:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DilwrAli Trump: Somewhere between the hair on his chin and 326.
1322940021549182988 2020-11-02 00:34:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Vietnamese out in force for Trump in Northern Virginia
1322933032651837442 2020-11-02 00:06:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Eraserheadbaby2 @thehangingchads @CatholicEcon 45% and trending up. He’s riding high.
1322908293275226112 2020-11-01 22:28:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> As I suspected: We have a set of polls that show a close race and another set of polls, mostly from the Resistance Media, that show some kind of national massacre of Republicans everywhere. This is just bizarre.
1322907000183918592 2020-11-01 22:23:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume This is so ridiculously irresponsible
1322903955110842373 2020-11-01 22:10:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Kane9015 @RupertVonRipp It is: Shows organic support. The energy simply is greater than 2016 for Trump.
1322902785017450498 2020-11-01 22:06:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Kane9015 @RupertVonRipp Some of these stretch over 100 miles. Just absolutely bonkers.
1322901026001870856 2020-11-01 21:59:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> And, sorry, but the Republicans definitely have more gas in the tank. Democrats need more low propensity voters to show up on Election Day. They just do at this point. And who knows how many low propensity Republicans will show up.
1322900242757537793 2020-11-01 21:56:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just don’t know how the pundit class can get around that so far the electorate looks more favorable to Republicans than it did in 2016.
1322892060249231360 2020-11-01 21:23:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Eraserheadbaby2 @thehangingchads @CatholicEcon Theoretically true, but this country is basically 50-50 Dem-Rep leaners. Who is more energized is a big deal.
1322889457700405250 2020-11-01 21:13:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Given the registered party makeup of the Iowa early vote (47-33-20), I’m virtually sure that 5% that refused to answer broke heavily for Trump and voted early.
1322777886001082369 2020-11-01 13:49:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @tonybalogna The age break among Republican mail ins is rather jaw dropping.
1322777646162464769 2020-11-01 13:49:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @tonybalogna Pennsylvania Republicans told their old people to vote by mail if they felt uncomfortable. About 400K of them have done it. The rest appear set to storm polls on November 3rd.
1322774615521984513 2020-11-01 13:36:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This reminds me so much of McCain’s last minute Pennsylvania Hail Mary or Kerry’s Virginia Hail Mary,
1322772040697393152 2020-11-01 13:26:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou That said, my running theory is that the polling aggregate is messed up by these push polls this time.
1322771826301349889 2020-11-01 13:25:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou That’s a month of court battles and sleepless nights for everyone.
1322762283743928320 2020-11-01 12:47:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Stuff doesn’t happen in a vacuum. There aren’t the exact same breaks in the exact same demos across the board in very state. Campaigning has some effect.
1322761112186736642 2020-11-01 12:43:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BillTaggert @SelimSeesYou Zero
1322760988526071813 2020-11-01 12:42:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Technically, yes, but no one is dumb enough to leak that info to Dave Wasserman.
1322755868375556096 2020-11-01 12:22:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BKudron @Peoples_Pundit If Miami ends up as Republican as Trump’s campaign thinks it might, they’ll be forced to call it once the Panhandle reports.
1322755216119341056 2020-11-01 12:19:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @17cShyteposter @SelimSeesYou Wisconsin poll. That and everyone knows that Iowa poll isn’t some random bullshit like CNN. Also Trump+2 in Florida according to ABC/WaPo
1322754840372662274 2020-11-01 12:18:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAFoshee Popular vote!
1322754338851299328 2020-11-01 12:16:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAFoshee I don’t think Trump will carry Hawaii. It’s just indicative of potential crossovers in this realignment election.
1322752327892246528 2020-11-01 12:08:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Supposedly 90% of the vote so far in Hawaii is Democrat.
1322748321375674374 2020-11-01 11:52:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 Not sure. Wilmington is heavily Democratic, though.
1322747878327095296 2020-11-01 11:50:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 That state is basically a small town: God knows if they believe the laptop stuff.
1322747601440198656 2020-11-01 11:49:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Maybe that’s why I want it...
1322747433688932353 2020-11-01 11:48:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StValentine_ Flip Nevada and it’s my “Arizona is gay” map.
1322747267422527488 2020-11-01 11:48:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 That’s the bigger part of me. The other part of me is just a troll.
1322746826773155842 2020-11-01 11:46:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> A part of me wants my map where the whole rust belt flips, Trump wins, but Texas goes for Biden. Would really mess with a lot of narratives.
1322746512359804928 2020-11-01 11:45:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Your lies will come home to haunt you, Bill.

1322745396024791040 2020-11-01 11:40:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> In terms of Registered Voters, Nevada is 2.3% more Republican than it was in 2016 at the close of early voting. Vote Nevadans!

1322743573314502657 2020-11-01 11:33:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp He knows Trump has a greater than 10% chance of winning somewhere in his soul. This isn’t 1932z
1322742488868728834 2020-11-01 11:29:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pimpisyou I’m just having fun dude.
1322741468168114178 2020-11-01 11:25:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dude, these people are done. I can’t wait. I almost want to call the race, but the future is always uncertain. Trump definite advantage.
1322739363671904257 2020-11-01 11:16:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I think we’re onto Election Day. As of today, the national electorate is more Republican than it was in 2016.
1322738348780331010 2020-11-01 11:12:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cogi2_ErgoTsun At this point I’m convinced some portion, probably most, of the pollsters are legit just faking numbers.
1322736319399866369 2020-11-01 11:04:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> What is going on tonight? I’m having a great time.
1322735562789396482 2020-11-01 11:01:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 👀
1322735355137839104 2020-11-01 11:00:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume And that’s with Nate Silver putting his finger on the scales.
1322732487735468034 2020-11-01 10:49:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 If California votes for Trump, I’m moving back.
1322732413802479620 2020-11-01 10:49:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DilwrAli Have some fun man
1322732030707249154 2020-11-01 10:47:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK The Iowa poll really has them panicking. They have a brilliant reputation and Iowa is a bellwether.
1322731694177292296 2020-11-01 10:46:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 They know something doesn’t seem right about all this shit.
1322731478728482816 2020-11-01 10:45:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Fox News Election Alert: Illinois too close to call, Biden edge, but waiting for returns to verify.
1322730054103826435 2020-11-01 10:39:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Baris says he regularly gets people who have already voted who say they’re undecided. People are weird man.
1322729725035511811 2020-11-01 10:38:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CoolChange80 @SelimSeesYou Then there’s that and you have a point and I’ll leave it at that.
1322729529295675393 2020-11-01 10:37:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PianistF A few of them are.
1322729204266471426 2020-11-01 10:36:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cogi2_ErgoTsun Someone I know is dating someone and I’ll leave it at that.
1322728160643981312 2020-11-01 10:32:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SageMccallister @SelimSeesYou That’s definitely a part of it. House races under Obama were easy to predict. We’re returning to an era that may see more split ticketing and have a more “all politics is local” vibe.
1322727493577674753 2020-11-01 10:29:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I don’t even know anymore. I used to respect these people as political forecasters. Just not buying what they’re selling.
1322726889794932736 2020-11-01 10:27:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou Isn’t that case next month?
1322726802754883585 2020-11-01 10:26:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The House has been way underpolled and there’s some supposedly “likely” and safe Dems that think they’re in trouble.
1322726230882471938 2020-11-01 10:24:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LueYee @Cogi2_ErgoTsun Let’s not go too far here.
1322725647404466176 2020-11-01 10:22:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Iowa House races have been a bellwether of late. If Republicans take 3/4....not good for Democrats and not just because of two random House seats in some farm state.
1322724962445205504 2020-11-01 10:19:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StValentine_ @BorisJohnson No doubt Biden is the candidate of the globalist elite. The Great Reset and all that crazy Orwellian crap.
1322724764608307200 2020-11-01 10:18:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DilwrAli The science is in: A marginal number more people will die this year than last. Maybe even less.
1322724400291041282 2020-11-01 10:17:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DilwrAli NO MORTALITY INCREASE
1322724068492255234 2020-11-01 10:16:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Hey, guys, Biden is the better candidate because of a slogan he ripped off from @BorisJohnson. Everyone can go home now.
1322723721212272640 2020-11-01 10:14:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DilwrAli I’m not changing the world forever because of a fucking cold. NO MORTALITY INCREASE
1322723301274329089 2020-11-01 10:13:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DilwrAli I’m still waiting for the mass mortality from Sturgis.
1322722703875387394 2020-11-01 10:10:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DilwrAli There’s no evidence outside events even cause spread.
1322721893754032131 2020-11-01 10:07:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DilwrAli There will be no mortality increase this year. Sell your lies somewhere else.
1322721270946025477 2020-11-01 10:05:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Who would win: An angry, senile old man or a movement dedicated to rebuilding this country, from the ground up if necessary?
1322720759639429120 2020-11-01 10:02:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @davidchapman141 It’s propaganda. I think there are systematic problems for polls in general and then there’s a set of polls that are pure propaganda and not even real.
1322719909630124033 2020-11-01 09:59:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 More like add 10 for Trump +/- 4 from there.
1322716154369056769 2020-11-01 09:44:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation I think Trump wins because deep down Americans are an honest and fair people and they waited to hear Trump’s final case to vote. He delivered as I expected and it’s a race. Combine that with the far older, Whiter, and more Republican electorate than we were expecting.
1322715517778563072 2020-11-01 09:42:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @yemanouspeak @joehiden16 I wonder why young people aren’t flocking to the polls.
1322715232318427142 2020-11-01 09:41:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cogi2_ErgoTsun Teachers break for Democrats big. Young women break for Democrats big. Single women break for Democrats big. Combining them: not many who vote GOP. I happen to know a bunch.
1322712418875809792 2020-11-01 09:29:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cole45458208 Yes. One of them voted for Johnson. A couple just didn’t vote.
1322710593317515266 2020-11-01 09:22:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 Most of them were just raised Republicans. The others just became friends with the ones who were and adopted the culture.
1322709597321310208 2020-11-01 09:18:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I have very unrepresentative friends: I know a BUNCH of single female teachers in their 20s who are voting for Trump in Fairfax County, Virginia.
1322692192780038146 2020-11-01 08:09:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 @realikamusume It’s 900 people in Iowa and it’s the same as 2016.
1322691292191772673 2020-11-01 08:05:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Suddenly the Democrats are suspicious of polls.
1322690964671074304 2020-11-01 08:04:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ori_Ar @WilkesBoothProj @PianistF At least net 100K Republicans over Democrats. Maybe more. God knows how many backwoods Trumpists will emerge from the Panhandle.
1322689989445066753 2020-11-01 08:00:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WilkesBoothProj @PianistF @Ori_Ar The undecided vote is very favorable to Trump in Pennsylvania. Blacks have made up their mind.
1322686985610383361 2020-11-01 07:48:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ToplessVegas @realikamusume Same as 2016. Independents and women rallying to Trump in the final days. If this repeats nationally, that’s great news for the President.
1322686087748329473 2020-11-01 07:45:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dea Moisnes Register reported 5% that didn’t want to tell them who they wanted to vote for. That’s incredibly thorough. Total X factor.
1322684354452197380 2020-11-01 07:38:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All the polls I trust to be trying to do their job are breaking towards Trump in the final days. Then there’s another set of polls that appear to just be total BS.
1322683573657284608 2020-11-01 07:35:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis @CottoGottfried @Barnes_Law @RealAPolitics @RedEaglePatriot @reddvoyager1 @Peoples_Pundit CNN has always had great election coverage honestly. Always preferred it to Fox. Think that will change this year.
1322683123189108736 2020-11-01 07:33:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DDG_994 Same poll result. Overall, this poll is better for Trump given the momentum among indies. If that’s national, this race is breaking for Trump huge.
1322682629800558593 2020-11-01 07:31:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump plus 7 same as 2016!!!!!
1322682501740040193 2020-11-01 07:30:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump +7 same as 2016!!!!
1322681839564267523 2020-11-01 07:28:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cogi2_ErgoTsun 2 minutes
1322678661426880512 2020-11-01 07:15:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation President drops in 15 from what I understand. Nervous about this one tbh.
1322677063564824576 2020-11-01 07:09:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump has been running ahead of Ernst. This is a nail biter.
1322672233886658561 2020-11-01 06:50:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 @smallgovlizard He’s just wrong too.
1322671967980474369 2020-11-01 06:49:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SWfan4life @AirBossUT5 If you vote in primaries and midterms/off years, you’re probably a super voter anyway.
1322670062260682753 2020-11-01 06:41:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 It is. Republicans are notorious for marching to the polls in spite of crazy odds.
1322669368434720768 2020-11-01 06:38:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 We’re not supposed to “know the results” according to the other side for days, so I can only assume it’s an attempt to: 1. Suppress Republican voters by demotivating them. AND 2. Delegitimize a close Trump Electoral Victory
1322668403988062208 2020-11-01 06:34:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Along the same lines:
1322664824648716289 2020-11-01 06:20:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I honestly don’t know what to make of this. It is extremely bizarre. The behavior of the Biden campaign has been utterly bizarre throughout this whole cycle.
1322664479700766721 2020-11-01 06:19:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CelticRoman8 @NoctRomaRTW I honestly don’t know what to make of this.
1322661284974891013 2020-11-01 06:06:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 @SelbJim @davidchapman141 @ToplessVegas @galt1776 The public polls in Indiana are right where they were in 2016. We will know pretty early if they were right. I doubt it.
1322648842735636480 2020-11-01 05:17:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly Exit polls are even worse than regular polls.
1322622019322695680 2020-11-01 03:30:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I’m going to one tomorrow!
1322621890968621056 2020-11-01 03:30:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @realikamusume  https://t.co/1ic38eKwcF
1322618829328056323 2020-11-01 03:17:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CransleyPerfume He had Trump gain nearly 2% since last time. I think his electorate is way too Democratic there too.
1322613166644350976 2020-11-01 02:55:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is .2% improvement for Trump since the last poll. Late deciders in suburbs breaking for Trump. Likely won’t collapse there at this point.
1322612061566865409 2020-11-01 02:51:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Just to reiterate the point: Since response rates are as low as restaurant review rates, the entire art of polling is about figuring out who’s actually going to show up to vote. Marginal errors on this can lead to big errors overall.
1322610812129808384 2020-11-01 02:46:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 @RealAPolitics I remember when Election commentators used to actually understand that people can change their minds.
1322608672036556810 2020-11-01 02:37:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis There are so many unknowns in the rust belt, which is I’m tentative. Especially Pennsylvania. The super and frequent voter numbers there look excellent for Republicans to make up a huge gap, but I still think it will come down to whether low propensity Ds finally show up.
1322607913597358080 2020-11-01 02:34:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis On Sunday or Monday night I’ll draw something up.
1322606458123493384 2020-11-01 02:28:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan This dude is the reason why normal establishment Republicans (not the utterly corrupt Bush wing, but the typical GOP County Chairman) have been skeptical of insurgents: they’re unreliable backstabbers who don’t understand you keep this shit behind closed doors.
1322605616771276803 2020-11-01 02:25:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan This one was more of a formal speech. The other ones are his typical rally.
1322605124028669954 2020-11-01 02:23:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Deus_Rex_Patria They’re still up in terms of proportion of the vote. Men just vote at lower rates than women.
1322604907002843140 2020-11-01 02:22:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> BTW, this is the case in basically all these all mail in, virtually all early vote states with the exception of California where there basically isn’t a rural vote.
1322603408797433867 2020-11-01 02:16:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump’s speech in Pennsylvania was great.
1322602258916384769 2020-11-01 02:12:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CelticRoman8 It’s our job!
1322597175805812736 2020-11-01 01:51:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The national net super voters of 1.5-3 million I mentioned yesterday are disproportionately in the key swing states. I don’t think Democrats banked enough of these infrequent voters. And NPAs nationally waited to hear the final case: Another blow to Democratic prospects.
1322594397670825984 2020-11-01 01:40:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> In Pennsylvania, registered Republicans should net 700K on the current Democrat returns in super and frequent voters alone. That would leave the gap at 300K in the Democrats’ favor. The gap in 2016 was 398K in favor of Democrats.
1322590599070044164 2020-11-01 01:25:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @MarcusShrinking I’m almost going to be disappointed when they don’t materialize.
1322590061850955776 2020-11-01 01:23:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These admin insiders are making a strong case for Trump’s base to be out in force!
1322589499352821770 2020-11-01 01:21:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 Yeah. I think part of what’s going on is that Biden will get narrower margins from these traditionally Democratic groups because the R-leaning ones will go and all the D leaning ones are at home scared of Covid. These people are weird.
1322589075153559554 2020-11-01 01:19:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @riesi041 @Chillin_out_ @RedEaglePatriot If they have 51% of the National early vote, and we win Election Day 2:1, that seems like a win to me.
1322587960722759680 2020-11-01 01:15:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NuncVideo @MylesNunez305 @Mark_E_Noonan @CottoGottfried It’s the same mistake most challenging parties to an incumbent President make: they nominate a total blank slate because they assume people are sick of the incumbent.
1322586430347104256 2020-11-01 01:09:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 Registered party. Both are down. But Dems are down a bit more.
1322585787523833857 2020-11-01 01:06:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The youth vote is net 1% more Republican this year in North Carolina.
1322582003317952514 2020-11-01 00:51:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PatrickSquarep6 @TRElections Low turnout congressional district primaries aren’t easy to poll.
1322581097427992577 2020-11-01 00:48:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BibMccafferty @realikamusume The Dems are making the same mistake the GOP did with 2010 and both misunderstanding the nature of the midterm election and why they won.
1322580151356608515 2020-11-01 00:44:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LarryJB33 The big X factor is indies. If they are even split at this point in the key swing states, I think Trump will do well. As for 2018, Republicans didn’t do that poorly in the key swing states.
1322578108269166594 2020-11-01 00:36:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LarryJB33 I’m right there. I just don’t see it happening for them. But the future is always uncertain from our point of view.
1322574295172849667 2020-11-01 00:20:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Kane9015 That’s what I’m thinking. Like there’s going to be a large group of people, no matter what happens, that will be in utter disbelief.
1322573087183904771 2020-11-01 00:16:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Literally everyone is all in on their narratives at this point and I’m not sure I’ve ever seen anything like it.
1322571590366875649 2020-11-01 00:10:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Well, someone is going to be unemployed.
1322569781711654913 2020-11-01 00:03:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MarcusShrinking @JayFiveK I think they’ll definitely try, but if turnout is any indication, their voters aren’t feeling it.
1322563607557713920 2020-10-31 23:38:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly @realikamusume Their entire campaign is premised on scaring White seniors to vote Biden at this point because of Covid at this point.
1322436921247805440 2020-10-31 15:15:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @William18716726 @JohnFiliss @Barnes_Law Fewer of them because of those lockdowns.
1322434103569010690 2020-10-31 15:03:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Em3Doctor @Barnes_Law @CottoGottfried @YouGov That’s just in GOP registrations. Add NPAs to the mix and the margin should be well north of that.
1322433954029412352 2020-10-31 15:03:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law @CottoGottfried @YouGov If Trump wins Indies, this election is over.
1322427949962977280 2020-10-31 14:39:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FCorak @Barnes_Law And the incumbent lost.
1322424772161114114 2020-10-31 14:26:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark @17cShyteposter It's not just the Economist. Basically all the polls found that Trump would win E-Day vote by 2:1 margins. I'm not as optimistic about that now, but I still expect Trump to win the E-Day vote by a significant margin.
1322424141945950208 2020-10-31 14:24:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago The whole point of this election for the Republicans is to seal the Presidential coalition they created in 2016 (and that should have been sealed back in 2004, were it not for Bush's failures). If they don't f it up, they could have 16 years in the White House, I'm convinced.
1322422914839384065 2020-10-31 14:19:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GlenWalken @davidchapman141 @RealAPolitics There's just not enough of these wealthy types.
1322421996395835393 2020-10-31 14:15:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical The media's treatment is literally the inverse: Any criticism of Obama's policies or anything was "racism" and for Trump and support of his policies is also racism. It's just dumb.
1322421219539517440 2020-10-31 14:12:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GoogleAgorism @RealAPolitics Yeah, people were worried about Bernie, but I think Bernie would have eventually turned off Independents and drive Republicans out to the polls in record numbers. Biden wasn't as much of a mess as he is now.
1322420408365338624 2020-10-31 14:09:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> By most indications, people like Trump more than they did in 2016. That's the calculation of the left this election: They think they can sneak by on just Trump hate and Joe is less objectionable than Hillary. Problem: What if people just don't hate Trump as much as 4 years ago?
1322420081570308096 2020-10-31 14:08:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump is like the reverse Obama: Started out unpopular, unliked, and no one believed his campaign. Trump ended up sneaking through to the Presidency, delivering on a lot,  and has battled the media where Obama was lifted by it. Narratively, this election should end with a win.
1322418756916776960 2020-10-31 14:02:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cougarsportsfan I don't really care about the polls at this point.
1322418338451128321 2020-10-31 14:01:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics They could have kept the WWC in the rust belt if they nominated Biden in 2016. They didn't. Trump delivered on trade and it will payoff on Tuesday. Even if Biden wins, it will be because of crazy margins in Montgomery, Bucks, Delaware, and Chester Counties.
1322417566267199490 2020-10-31 13:58:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 @RealAPolitics Some other states like IA, OH, and WI with close margins favoring Trump, though a tie in WI.
1322416914119958530 2020-10-31 13:55:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 @RealAPolitics He got leaked internals. Trump up in MI and TX, but only by 4 in TX. Just feels like Biden would have went there more if it was that close.
1322413151812542465 2020-10-31 13:40:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates True.
1322413070904418305 2020-10-31 13:40:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 @pimpisyou We just got to meme it at this point.
1322412385672564737 2020-10-31 13:37:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates People already know who won Texas and Florida. They have to at this point.
1322410040184156161 2020-10-31 13:28:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Bernie Sanders has been told what's going down on Tuesday.
1322409499668393987 2020-10-31 13:26:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 There was a surge of Black NPAs in 2018 for obvious reasons. That's why the race was even close.
1322408860158726144 2020-10-31 13:23:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy If you're one of those people that shows up to every election, including primaries, and you've been a voter for at least 10 years, then probably. Most super voters don't reach that status until later in life, though. Hard to break in until you're in your 40s.
1322408221097734144 2020-10-31 13:21:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 I also think the NPAs are more Republican and TargetSmart seems to agree.
1322407787570364418 2020-10-31 13:19:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 Yeah. I think we're looking at R+5 or so this year too.
1322406110138146816 2020-10-31 13:12:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 Yeah, Republicans have at 70,000 more super voters in Florida, potentially 170,000 more. They also have a lot more frequent voters in the tank. Probably will net another 200+K out of them. Rest is just gravy. There will be an R+ electorate in Florida.
1322404696372449282 2020-10-31 13:07:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ori_Ar @AbdiPopulist @bishop_gains @Barnes_Law I was getting suspicious of this whole thing by early April after initially being sympathetic with expanded government powers in the emergency. Then came advice like this and I was like "this is obviously a joke."
1322403839224532992 2020-10-31 13:03:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The situation among "Frequent Voters" seems about tied. The situation among the irregular (first time and infrequent) is, by nature, unknown.
1322403050330464261 2020-10-31 13:00:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'd estimate that, nationally, the Republicans have between 1.5 and 3 million more Super Voters in the tank than Democrats.  https://t.co/pFzmmTTvtl
1322402579746357248 2020-10-31 12:58:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AbdiPopulist @Ori_Ar @bishop_gains @Barnes_Law I'd have to agree with that observation.
1322401201556697089 2020-10-31 12:53:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 I hear they're paying farms in China to like his crap. Just rumors, but it makes sense of all the random 4 follower new accounts that just spend time trolling and liking posts. These people don't seem real.
1322399937993334786 2020-10-31 12:48:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Someone told him people don't like lockdowns anymore.
1322398482813100033 2020-10-31 12:42:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf @realikamusume I imagine you could probably compute a model based on what percentage of the electorate have children of school age, but you'd probably have to lean it in favor of Republicans. Also, not all kids participate in the same mock elections.
1322397459012870144 2020-10-31 12:38:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume These maps are just like: WTF
1322396467764625408 2020-10-31 12:34:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot @RealAPolitics House is so hard to predict this cycle.
1322395705441398784 2020-10-31 12:31:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AbdiPopulist @Ori_Ar @bishop_gains @Barnes_Law I just don't get it. These are the people that take the advice from health officials to wear covid masks while having sex and that just grossed me out thinking about it so I will subject you to it too.
1322395387555172352 2020-10-31 12:30:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical NBC.
1322391834136662018 2020-10-31 12:15:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bishop_gains @Barnes_Law For some bizarre reason, the young Biden voters I know are more scared of Covid than my aged grandparents.
1322389992023429121 2020-10-31 12:08:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation Like, right now the rurals are estimated to be at 60% for the GOP in most polls. That’s the national modeled Republican vote in the national rural regions, not incorporating Indies or Dem crossovers. Rural Dems are less loyal than urban Ds and rural Rs are more loyal.
1322389369811013633 2020-10-31 12:06:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation Republican margins are routinely underestimated in the rurals. It’s usually the cause of a polling miss for Republicans. If you combine it with potential shy Trumpers in swing state metro suburbs, could be massive.
1322388942684065792 2020-10-31 12:04:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @1516Patriot @realikamusume Hope so!
1322388800849518599 2020-10-31 12:03:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JurisNaturalism That’s definitely it. The WNs with some real world investment I wouldn’t classify as wignats in the first place really.
1322386602199556101 2020-10-31 11:55:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 I could listen to these guys all day. Their old school yankee accents are buttery smooth.
1322386121343569920 2020-10-31 11:53:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Watching the 1968 Election returns: You can track our decline as a country since TV was a thing by how much more annoying the voices of the network news anchors are.
1322378418479075328 2020-10-31 11:22:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 Yeah, they seem to buy mainstream narratives on basically everything but race and it leads to some really weird ideas.
1322378209770561536 2020-10-31 11:21:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden I just somehow separate my extremist, out of the mainstream bits of ideology from my practical electoral politics. Like they’re just different things. At the end of the day one of these guys is going to be President and I want the one that’s better for me at the end of the day.
1322375718794309633 2020-10-31 11:11:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden They think it’s like a direct transfer payment to Blacks. They don’t understand that would be unconstitutional anyway.
1322374938792251392 2020-10-31 11:08:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @W4nk_3ngine @Theo_Chilton Yes
1322347263872684033 2020-10-31 09:18:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BibMccafferty @ProudColonizer Actually working people in the Rust Belt are happy with Trump. They live in a delusional alternate universe where these people are wignats themselves instead of just people who want jobs.
1322346629979115520 2020-10-31 09:16:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BibMccafferty @ProudColonizer It’s the Friday before the election and they’re still complaining “how dare Trump even try to earn Black votes!” I don’t even know what to say about it at this point.
1322344861027151873 2020-10-31 09:09:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pimpisyou I think I’ve been clear.
1322344433673773056 2020-10-31 09:07:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pimpisyou Biden is a silent you dumbass.
1322344177896722432 2020-10-31 09:06:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pimpisyou The future is always uncertain. And, no, it isn’t just Boomers, it’s also silents. The Boomers might be a problem too.
1322342657729863680 2020-10-31 09:00:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DagothUrm @RyanGirdusky You think White voters aren’t showing up because of the Platinum Plan and don’t actually listen to any of the Trump campaign.
1322342387734126593 2020-10-31 08:59:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Sorry to inform wignats, but if Trump loses the election, it’s not because of the Platinum Plan. It would be because enough White seniors got scared by Covid and believed Democrats’ BS promises to magically remedy it.
1322341967628439552 2020-10-31 08:57:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DagothUrm @RyanGirdusky You’re living in an alternate universe.
1322341316194230273 2020-10-31 08:55:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 Not sure there was much the Dems could do to get Black turnout up this election.
1322340151197003777 2020-10-31 08:50:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky Dude, shut up.
1322336577951993856 2020-10-31 08:36:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 I think @Barnes_Law is right at this point: People’s lived experience is just running in the face of this narrative at this point.
1322336293913681920 2020-10-31 08:35:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 I also had a map with Trump winning without Texas. I’m just having fun here.
1322335804363079681 2020-10-31 08:33:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The “dang, Democrats really should have picked Klobuchar” map.  https://t.co/o72VL8o8Ux
1322333020293128193 2020-10-31 08:22:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TennentsPlease Same. Nothing I’ve seen has shaken my opinion that the numbers just aren’t adding up for them.
1322332609347751936 2020-10-31 08:20:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pimpisyou Thomas is a good justice with a good legal philosophy. Greatest? No. But only one guy can be that and that’s William Rehnquist.
1322332362655543296 2020-10-31 08:19:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TSeeker241 I’m referencing Clarence Thomas dunking on Joe Biden in his documentary.
1322332198247292929 2020-10-31 08:18:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TennentsPlease It’s driving me nuts. I take comfort knowing it’s over soon whatever happens.
1322332019678945284 2020-10-31 08:18:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pimpisyou He’s smarter than Joe Biden.
1322331656095731712 2020-10-31 08:16:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Joe’s not every smart and he never was. Just as Clarence Thomas.
1322331167950032898 2020-10-31 08:14:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All I’ve wanted from these people is a consistent narrative at this point.
1322331053986635776 2020-10-31 08:14:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @Independent I just want a consistent narrative from these people.
1322326793693646848 2020-10-31 07:57:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ded_ruckus @turrible_tao Extremely Online wignats get more on my nerves by the day.
1322323069785018371 2020-10-31 07:42:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Just heard about the crowd limiting in Minnesota: the Governor needs to be in jail.
1322311252471853056 2020-10-31 06:55:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CelticRoman8 Depends on the state really. The polls are so all over the place and they’re a difficult group to predict.
1322310713591869440 2020-10-31 06:53:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon @travis_john78 NeverTrump is a feint designed to throw your Republicans off, but at this point it’s throwing Dems off that there’s a massive group of Republican defectors they’re about ready to win an election with.
1322309418487324672 2020-10-31 06:48:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I knew this was the real reason for calling the “lid” as soon as he showed up in Chester the next day.
1322309285607624704 2020-10-31 06:47:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton This is exactly why Biden called a lid on Sunday night.
1322309022847016962 2020-10-31 06:46:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @travis_john78 They’re really stuck in this world where there’s just mass defection from the Republican Party.
1322307786408103943 2020-10-31 06:41:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @travis_john78 To be fair, there are always Republicans who think this is the year they’ll take California.
1322307603221925889 2020-10-31 06:41:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon I’ve seen these people say both! I’ve seen several argue Trump made them pay more taxes because they got a smaller refund.  https://t.co/bZnRVoa8Ad
1322306668743503883 2020-10-31 06:37:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They’re convinced the early vote is good news for them, failing to understand a higher percentage of Republicans are waiting to vote and that they need more young people and Blacks than expected to show up on Election Day.
1322306133642661890 2020-10-31 06:35:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I legit don’t think lefties understand the concepts of margins, per capita, and percentage.
1322305003541987362 2020-10-31 06:30:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf That’s what I felt like too, but those returns from Southeast...oosh. Hurt.
1322304773371109376 2020-10-31 06:29:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon Penn dumped their early vote and it was like 70-30 for Clinton. Just kept getting more narrow until Trump took a lead with like 70% in (which was predictable by the time 30% was in).
1322304524464365572 2020-10-31 06:29:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cole45458208 @Cogi2_ErgoTsun Florida went really blue. Those margins from the panhandle were simply crazy: No one expected them.
1322304328380698624 2020-10-31 06:28:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NVA08867863 That was years ago, btw.
1322304273158447104 2020-10-31 06:28:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NVA08867863 I muted Richard Spencer for a reason.
1322303109457190912 2020-10-31 06:23:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m old enough to remember when Rasmussen released their final Clinton+2 and everyone assumed the election was over. Heck, even I was nervous until about 9:30 PM.
1322301198263865346 2020-10-31 06:15:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The party of unity!   The sunglasses really reinforce the mob boss look. Guess it’s a campaign theme now.
1322299208267943937 2020-10-31 06:07:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiah_crawley Probably want to add @realikamusume and @RedEaglePatriot to the list.
1322297031122104321 2020-10-31 05:59:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiah_crawley Sorry, but I consider my commentary insane and off the rails.
1322296853954732035 2020-10-31 05:58:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 They seem to be saying that youth voters are drastically up everywhere: it makes no sense.
1322296538920615937 2020-10-31 05:57:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 Dems might inch forward nationally because California should start to trickle in. California's returns are really bad so far, actually. Most of the states running behind are Republican, though.
1322292737861931009 2020-10-31 05:42:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 The Electorate just is more Republican than it was 4 years ago. Baris was just showing that it’s 38% Republican in Wisconsin now. Was 30%. Some of our voters definitely decided to vote early instead of E-Day, but Trump is still set to swamp. They need NeverTrumpers.
1322291240847745024 2020-10-31 05:36:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If we missed the legion of Republicans voting early, what's to say there isn't an even bigger legion voting on Election Day? Where will these Dem votes come from?
1322291109385699333 2020-10-31 05:35:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just don't know how these Dems can delude themselves about this. Like, the polls were wrong. They refuse to ever admit they're wrong or even ask why. Constantly doubling down on the same errors over and over and over again.
1322290824676364288 2020-10-31 05:34:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @redsnowtree @DylanMasondbk @PpollingNumbers @GallupNews LOL, your dude blocked me: Republicans will win the Election Day vote by a bigger margin than they did in 2016 and he knows it.

More Republican. You need Republicans to vote for you as Trump WILL win election day, I'll bet my bottom dollar, even if he loses in the end.  https://t.co/csvlsqFihP

1322282112918147074 2020-10-31 04:59:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DylanMasondbk @redsnowtree @PpollingNumbers @GallupNews Oh, looks like Trump's at 46%. Seems higher than 40%. And it's trending upwards: Trend is important. Earlier this month it was 43 and this polls was half before the debate when this number has been trend up everywhere.
1322281521152172032 2020-10-31 04:57:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @redsnowtree @PpollingNumbers @GallupNews How do you get a "general approval" without doing a poll?

1322280798263955456 2020-10-31 04:54:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm totally ok with the reverse too. Obviously, whoever wins gets the better negotiating positions.

1322279838951026691 2020-10-31 04:50:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Can we just agree to a national divorce if these guys vote for Biden because Trump sent mean Tweets and a respiratory illness?
1322278168712126465 2020-10-31 04:44:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @redsnowtree @PpollingNumbers @GallupNews Not true. Bush got 48% in the final pre-election survey of 2004:  https://t.co/hpsKcUHCUJ
1322277832882556928 2020-10-31 04:42:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @whack_a_commie My only concern there is the Covid vote, but I'm just not buying it until it happens.
1322277618780090373 2020-10-31 04:42:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @calebqwash There are so many nonsensical numbers in these polls because of non-response.

Some a little, some a lot. It's crazy swings against him in the White vote and I'm just not buying it until I see it.
1322272502991773698 2020-10-31 04:21:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump's approval is the highest it has been during his Presidency besides the pandemic and the very first days and two random days in 2019.
1322270483576987649 2020-10-31 04:13:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CelticRoman8 Just inference.
1322270442736988160 2020-10-31 04:13:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mattljames11 @RealAPolitics If more Republicans are waiting to vote for Election Day than Democrats, it seems every demo that votes on Election Day would be more Republican than those that voted before Election Day.

1322269365803327488 2020-10-31 04:09:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Suddenly when the polling data doesn't match real life they're like "people change their minds."   Kind of like voting for Trump when they said they'd vote for Biden to a pollster. I guess they'll change their mind about everything but whether they'll vote for Trump.
1322268016927793152 2020-10-31 04:03:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics That’s the Republican ones anyway.
1322266735823753217 2020-10-31 03:58:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I feel like the opposite.
1322264538213949443 2020-10-31 03:50:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FoundingRequite That and the fact the media is running push polls with massive abandonment rates.
1322263825505243138 2020-10-31 03:47:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BladesOfChaos70 @SelimSeesYou No. There's this myth that goes around that saying you got this in the bag depresses your turnout: It doesn't. People like being on the winning side. Their constant message is that it's closer than the polls say.
1322258995374116864 2020-10-31 03:28:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Has there been a single campaign source from Biden saying that this thing is in the bag? I’d like a link.
1322257086810566657 2020-10-31 03:20:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Republicans won Florida Election Day voting in 2008. 2008. Think about that.

1322255861155332096 2020-10-31 03:15:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 True. Some indications Trump counties trust their officials more and are returning their ballots at a higher rate.
1322255337592885253 2020-10-31 03:13:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Pennsylvania is difficult to gauge because of the mail in X factor there. Like, these demos will all tilt more Dem than the in person vote there.
1322254055876579329 2020-10-31 03:08:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Yes, so far first time voters are a higher share of the electorate in 2016 versus this year. I'm talking about among first time voters.
1322253556381065216 2020-10-31 03:06:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Higher what?
1322253173424332800 2020-10-31 03:04:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Forgot modeled party (way better)  https://t.co/rykZlo9ntA
1322252631025291264 2020-10-31 03:02:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Here's some more info about this group that shows other good trends compared to 2018 since people keep asking about it. Gender gap is smaller, older. It's a bit less rural, but it's also less urban than 2016.  https://t.co/KJgghWa4d4

1322249985602265088 2020-10-31 02:52:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @down_the_summit @togreatness777 @realikamusume @RedEaglePatriot @RealAPolitics @SelimSeesYou And I'm comparing the final election numbers to the current numbers, so theoretically it should favor Dems way more than they do.
1322249861459251201 2020-10-31 02:51:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @down_the_summit @togreatness777 @realikamusume @RedEaglePatriot @RealAPolitics @SelimSeesYou The difference here is that everyone is expecting the Republican demos to massively increase on Election Day relative to the other Demos. That wasn't the case in 2016. So, the GOP only being marginally behind in anything is really good news.
1322248637318074369 2020-10-31 02:46:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @down_the_summit @togreatness777 @realikamusume @RedEaglePatriot @RealAPolitics @SelimSeesYou Yes, but these voters are also a bit older, more male, and more Republican as well. That uncoded is a big X-Factor too. It's 40% more proportionally.
1322247729020624896 2020-10-31 02:43:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot In order for Biden to win Texas, The Lincoln Project has to be more than a meme and if that's the case, this country is done anyway. Stick a fork in it.

1322244711264997383 2020-10-31 02:31:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @togreatness777 @realikamusume @RedEaglePatriot @RealAPolitics @SelimSeesYou This is first time voters. When you've already won, that matters less.

1322244205083828234 2020-10-31 02:29:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf @CEOofBarron @realikamusume @RedEaglePatriot @RealAPolitics @SelimSeesYou Exactly. Combine that with Black New Voters being down. Young new voters are basically stead (1% uptick is marginal). Also, the first time vote is disproportionately male.

1322240713589952514 2020-10-31 02:15:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation @SelimSeesYou Besides the polling this looks exactly like Bush 2004 to almost creepy levels. Just on steroids. It's like if Bush had succeeded in his goals in the rust belt (which he had tried to win himself). The huge x factor is rona.
1322240042107047937 2020-10-31 02:12:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cogi2_ErgoTsun That's true.
1322239097860247559 2020-10-31 02:09:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation I think he said that on Sunday as part of his "Trump steal" tweet.
1322237265486225409 2020-10-31 02:01:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou It’s what’s happening in Nevada.

1322236286602805251 2020-10-31 01:57:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> National first time voter demos. These are crazy good demos for Trump if this hold. CRAZY. @RedEaglePatriot @RealAPolitics @realikamusume @SelimSeesYou  https://t.co/rdzKDZ4z5I

1322234068755501065 2020-10-31 01:49:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dems seem to think every non-voter from 2016 is secretly /theirguy/ just demotivated and now they're rushing to the polls. The pattern just simply doesn't match this at all unless they think there are a bunch of hidden progressives among WWC voters in rural areas.
1322232203636596737 2020-10-31 01:41:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sgaspari @thehangingchads Do you even pay attention to data besides polls? Do you honestly believe lifelong Republicans are voting well above pace for Biden?
1322231734897942529 2020-10-31 01:39:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Mar-A-Lago or somewhere else in Florida is appropriate.

1322230637500239872 2020-10-31 01:35:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads 2.1 million. Several surveys claimed a third had already voted as of like 10 days ago.
1322230416137474049 2020-10-31 01:34:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> CCES 2016: "The survey was also designed to have representative samples in each state.

1322227358963814402 2020-10-31 01:22:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Dead cat bounce: Complacent Republicans in these places are rallying to the polls to prevent what they didn't think possible.
1322226400829575170 2020-10-31 01:18:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I believe it's safe to say at this point that more votes overall will be cast in person than by mail.
1322226203659554820 2020-10-31 01:17:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Have you heard of a dead cat bounce? Even if Texas is trending blue in the long run, it could break hard for Trump this year due to a rally effect.
1322225889317367815 2020-10-31 01:16:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads So were the polls right that half of Pennsylvanians would vote by mail or were they wrong? Because 3.1 million is not half of 6.8 and that's how many requests there are.

1322221302112026624 2020-10-31 00:58:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GarrettFAdams It was one of the big ironies of the 2016 election that Trump won the election on precisely these voters. There are definitely enough of these people surrounding Pittsburgh and in the "T" to win PA for Trump again.
1322220751097913344 2020-10-31 00:56:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads It's like there are two separate universes right now. They're going to collide on Tuesday in a magnificent manner.
1322219313093292038 2020-10-31 00:50:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> McCain’s polling was right, but it took 8 years and the right candidate for it to come to fruition.
1322219049397506049 2020-10-31 00:49:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Part of Silver’s claim to fame was discrediting McCain’s internal polling showing McCain was down by 6 in Pennsylvania. McCain lost PA by 10.3: Not that far off. McCain’s polling had picked up the long term Southwestern PA shift towards the GOP and expected it to play a big role.
1322216452380905472 2020-10-31 00:39:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan I mean, I hope not (unless they’re voting for Trump). Dems definitely need them. Their requests are just not enough there.
1322216171907747840 2020-10-31 00:37:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @coloredsands1 A lot of people, actually. There are still definitely large groups of swing voters.
1322215991934332928 2020-10-31 00:37:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Bad news for Democrats I should say.
1322215880277790720 2020-10-31 00:36:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 If it’s close in PA, yes.
1322215772291239936 2020-10-31 00:36:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> With the Black vote depressed most places, big thing to watch on Election Day are lines in the urban precincts: Philadelphia, Cuyahoga, Wayne, etc. Short wait times are bad news. Will be harder to ascertain the state of the race in rural areas.
1322215177547247616 2020-10-31 00:33:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I’m totally ok with Superior, Wisconsin port workers stuffing ballot boxes for Trump. They’re doing it: All is fair in love and war.
1322214384660324352 2020-10-31 00:30:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The race basically looks the same in the national polling as it did before the pandemic. It’s just bizarre. You’d think something somewhere would have caused something to change in the craziest year on record.
1322214046414852102 2020-10-31 00:29:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m going to be confident of Trump victory barring something stunning happening for Biden over the weekend, but if Trump loses, there’s nothing he could have realistically done. This is the most bizarre cycle we’ve seen in a long time. In some ways ever. Nothing moves the needle.
1322213172372230145 2020-10-31 00:26:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ProudColonizer I don’t even know what to make of this. Both sides are doubling and tripling down on their narratives. The Biden and Democratic Campaigns seem to be the only ones on the other side even ringing warning bells. It’s so bizarre.

1322211633897287681 2020-10-31 00:19:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou It’s because he dumped Trafalgar because of their leaked internals (probably unweighted) that he told everyone to ignore in the past.
1322209970897723394 2020-10-31 00:13:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @Barnes_Law If the election were tomorrow and Labor were running on “lockdown today, lockdown forever” they’d probably lose.
1322209735307857928 2020-10-31 00:12:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @Barnes_Law People often just express support for the opposition because they don’t like the incumbent’s policies. This election is more than 4 years away barring some crazy level of Tory defection, so this will be a thing of the past by then.
1322208702334717952 2020-10-31 00:08:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CelticRoman8 I think it was a miscalculation, but it’s such a huge unknown. Complete x-factor.
1322208487817023491 2020-10-31 00:07:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW I think it will in the end as well because the mood has shifted drastically on the issue over the last month, but I think they legit had seniors scared for a while.
1322208070395666432 2020-10-31 00:05:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I feel like if Scott Walker held on in 2018 and opened up Wisconsin, this still wouldn’t even be a race. Wisconsin would be secure and the reverberations would be felt throughout the rust belt.
1322207395582513152 2020-10-31 00:03:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Part of the reason I believe a normal election sans Covid and this month long mail in business would have been a certain landslide. Like, the only argument Dems have is this Covid scare.
1322205941006241792 2020-10-30 23:57:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @kevxcollins @AndToddsaid @LarrySchweikart I don’t know how many times the speakers yelled 133 votes at the 2008 State Convention. GOP was still pissed about that brazen criminality.
1322203769157943296 2020-10-30 23:48:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jaden_nixon @realikamusume If we somehow narrow the margins to Romney levels here in NoVA, Trump will carry on the strength of rural turnout. Might even pull if off with 16 margins. Just can't regress below 16. Early vote is looking ok in Fairfax for Republicans. Just ok, though.
1322203235927658496 2020-10-30 23:46:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume "Vote Pro-Life" signs are all over my NoVA neighborhood. Our precinct has always been GOP, though.
1322202571168251908 2020-10-30 23:43:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 They're defending their President at unprecedented rates for the modern era.
1322202326036291587 2020-10-30 23:42:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 Sunday is the last day in Florida, right?
1322202109547335680 2020-10-30 23:42:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @subschneider @LarrySchweikart I know Washington transitioned in 2006 (I lived there). I knew Oregon was earlier, but wasn't sure.
1322201902294179847 2020-10-30 23:41:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AndToddsaid @LarrySchweikart Washington is totally corrupt. They definitely robbed the 04 Governor's race with mail in votes.
1322201745695584256 2020-10-30 23:40:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IndependentUnd1 Everyone seems to think so. Even the Democrats and the pollsters. I think they wanted a lot more votes in before the last debate.
1322201172640411650 2020-10-30 23:38:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm not as worried about the surge of early voting this week as I was last week. This week's early voting favors Trump a lot more than the mail ins flowing in last week.
1322199135345364999 2020-10-30 23:30:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Oregon has been all mail in for over a decade. Interesting data, but it's not absentee voting.
1322198970215632896 2020-10-30 23:29:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LarrySchweikart Oregon has been all mail in for over a decade. Same with neighboring Washington.
1322197765154328577 2020-10-30 23:24:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CEOofBarron The margins of error on the state level are enormous.
1322196581567942657 2020-10-30 23:20:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume The lefties are acting like this is some big win as if it doesn’t signal Trump is going to get the same support in Connecticut as he did 4 years ago, at least.
1322195529061847040 2020-10-30 23:15:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cogi2_ErgoTsun @AirBossUT5 That's what I figured. Subsamples are simply too small too make sense on a state level.
1322195345170964482 2020-10-30 23:15:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Gauntlets thrown.
1322192761722949636 2020-10-30 23:04:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Data_Groypr Early voting data would tend to agree.
1322192231437078530 2020-10-30 23:02:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 @NateSilver538 Everyone wants to be a TLP donor.
1322191133783588864 2020-10-30 22:58:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @realikamusume Like, this just didn't happen with Democrats under Obama.
1322190728051724290 2020-10-30 22:56:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 This polls is utterly bizarre. Says Trump's only 5 points down nationally, but the state polls are all over the map.
1322190161451601920 2020-10-30 22:54:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> How does the electorate get so much more Republican if we're under a horrifyingly unpopular Republican incumbent?
1322189703362367493 2020-10-30 22:52:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Data_Groypr It also has Trump down by 19 in Michigan. I don't think those states have ever in history voted 30 points apart from each other.
1322188913730035718 2020-10-30 22:49:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The numbers on the Florida mail ballots requested updated: Now shows 3.13 million for Dems (was 2.6) and 2.96 for Republicans. The return rates for both are now low, but I'm wondering if they're able to count people who surrendered their mail in to vote in person.
1322185129771622401 2020-10-30 22:34:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SR71999 This is heavily skewed by the trash Wisconsin Biden+17 poll.
1322183436900204545 2020-10-30 22:27:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The trend is more important to me than the raw number. Trump definitely has the momentum coming into the home stretch.
1322182853485072384 2020-10-30 22:25:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Uh...but then he went over to the Vikings and he's actually from Mississippi.   I think celebrity endorsements of the type Trump is getting add to the feeling of momentum. People always expect big stars to endorse Dems, but it's news when they endorse the GOP.
1322181940481544192 2020-10-30 22:21:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BibMccafferty @thehangingchads Seriously. This has to be the most bizarre coalition assembled in campaign history.
1322181553749975048 2020-10-30 22:20:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan They're like the reverse of the NeverTrumper: They're trying to agree with the left somewhere so they can feel like they're being Very Rational and Objective or something. "Both sides get it wrong!" sort of thing as if that will save them.
1322180204723318785 2020-10-30 22:15:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These NatPops remember this tax plan was on the Trump campaign website, right?
1322179855857917956 2020-10-30 22:13:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm super conservative: I repeat left-wing talking points. It's like they think I don't notice that my paycheck got bigger after this was passed.
1322177433563529216 2020-10-30 22:03:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TexasVC Oh, and SC doesn't differentiate between a mailed ballot and an in person vote. So, their return rate is unusually high  because some people vote absentee-in-person and these are counted as returned mail ins.
1322175981654843392 2020-10-30 21:58:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The University of North Florida claimed Republicans "traditionally lead in in person early voting and Democrat vote by mail." These people are just flat lying at this point: It was always the opposite, mostly because of "Souls to the Polls" by Democrats.
1322175374059601924 2020-10-30 21:55:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TexasVC Literally every state shows Republicans ditching mail ins/absentees they traditionally use and voting in person. I don't care what Democrats are up to.
1322175062250803200 2020-10-30 21:54:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @yemanouspeak If he isn't in on the whole thing, something has to be telling his data nerd brain something isn't adding up here. This polling cycle makes no sense. Even in 2016, there were at least some patterns in the polling data you can point to. This crap is just all over the map.
1322173353264848897 2020-10-30 21:47:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Hint: It's Republicans doing the voting.
1322172872782188544 2020-10-30 21:45:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Here they go again: Threatening me with a good time.
1322172228142878721 2020-10-30 21:43:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 @LuisBobby3 You'd actually be wrong about California, surprisingly enough. I mean, they're almost there, but they about another million before I'd say it's a total lock. I fully expect them to get that (or more), but it's surprising how slow they are being to return their ballots there.
1322171664998764546 2020-10-30 21:41:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 He's saying that Biden's pollsters called to tell him to HEDGE, HEDGE, HEDGE because this is going to be one long night for media polling.
1322170844030898176 2020-10-30 21:37:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I thought we would have to have the "biggest polling miss" ever and enough people had already voted for Biden.
1322170691207204865 2020-10-30 21:37:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 I thought the Democrats already had all the votes in the bank?
1322170082001301507 2020-10-30 21:34:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cogi2_ErgoTsun @SelimSeesYou If it’s bleak, it wouldn’t be the first time a poll with a good track record got it really wrong.
1322169844737953798 2020-10-30 21:33:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cogi2_ErgoTsun @SelimSeesYou I expect it to be a bit tighter than it was last time. Iowa usually votes left of Ohio. Wouldn’t be surprised if they returned to form a bit.
1322167714702594049 2020-10-30 21:25:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cogi2_ErgoTsun @SelimSeesYou Dea Moines Register. They have a good track record: They got Trump+7 in 2016, Obama+5 in 12, etc. They did tarnish their reputation this year by not publishing a Democrat caucus poll.
1322167230797414400 2020-10-30 21:23:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @space44331811 @SelimSeesYou Don’t you know? Lifelong Republicans are rushing to the polls to reject Drumpf because they’ve had enough of the Bad Orange Man.
1322166339046412291 2020-10-30 21:19:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The big Iowa poll doesn’t come out until Sunday.
1322164414821421058 2020-10-30 21:12:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads It’s non-Black: 40% of the non-Black, non-White vote is vaguely possible.
1322042558252519424 2020-10-30 13:08:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JoelLoren1 I think Trump will improve, it for no other reason than there are more Republicans in California than there were four years ago and California Dems are notoriously unreliable voters. I think a strong Republican candidate can win the Governor’s Mansion in 2022, though.
1322041354206302208 2020-10-30 13:03:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @turdferguson691 @BiskyRusiness @schwartzbCNBC Probably didn’t even bother asking because if PA is looking good, Ohio is too.
1322040831675670528 2020-10-30 13:01:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JoelLoren1 They did make a national buy. Tells me they're going for a popular vote win. Something crazy has to happen for Trump to even get close in California.
1322039692523675650 2020-10-30 12:56:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Nasoj12 @HeritageNLegacy 2.2 according to the election project: They do have an abysmal mail in percentage too.
1322036494299762688 2020-10-30 12:43:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing I'm just not going to let my hopes get that high.
1322036031701585923 2020-10-30 12:42:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Nasoj12 I'm not remarking on the possibility of winning California. I'm just saying it's incredibly odd that their return rate is so slow.
1322035105532121088 2020-10-30 12:38:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just find it incredibly odd that, in an election where Democrats are supposed to be crawling over glass early to get rid of Donald Trump, only 150K more California Dems have voted than Texas Republicans and they've had this mail ballot for a long time.
1322034226255069184 2020-10-30 12:34:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy No, but we might win the popular vote if this keeps pace and it hasn't really picked up that much. Texas still has more votes in.
1322033458504491008 2020-10-30 12:31:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> California Democrats have a 45% mail in ballot return rate so far. Odd.
1322029964468887553 2020-10-30 12:18:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JurisNaturalism No way Grand Rapids, Michigan ends up outside Jesusland. Also: Vegas is in Jesusland? What?
1322026961984782337 2020-10-30 12:06:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Reminder that 80% of Joe's voters will have voted by Sunday in Florida.
1322025738720206848 2020-10-30 12:01:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 @DavidMasterson6 Yeah, you'd have to have access to the voter file as it was updated and no one is going to pay for that and then just tell people on Twitter.
1322024203999170563 2020-10-30 11:55:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JurisNaturalism That explains Butler’s abysmal return rate.
1322022651230113792 2020-10-30 11:48:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The sampling error in a poll is for each number in the data. So a poll showing 50-44 with a +/- of 3% could be 47-47. This is why people started averaging multiple polls because you expect the data to fall on regular distribution (hint: it doesn’t this cycle).
1322021534760902662 2020-10-30 11:44:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @powerkekt @realikamusume True. But still. I do like ending the campaign in Michigan.
1322020692062339074 2020-10-30 11:41:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Still waiting for the mass Sturgis death.
1322020002871074816 2020-10-30 11:38:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheWeatherGroyp @realikamusume If he carries Grand Rapids by an increased margin over 2016, he carries Michigan. Simple as.
1322018931926802434 2020-10-30 11:34:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume The only thing I don't like about this schedule is the symbolism of using Gerald Ford International Airport.
1322018606323011584 2020-10-30 11:32:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @powerkekt @SelimSeesYou That was part of the reason for hitting NE-2: Also hits Iowa.
1322018053035614208 2020-10-30 11:30:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @powerkekt @SelimSeesYou And WI.
1322018005342183425 2020-10-30 11:30:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @powerkekt @SelimSeesYou He's in MN tomorrow.
1322017240057892865 2020-10-30 11:27:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @KingBroly They used to not do weighted polls except by likely voter algorithms. Of course, that was back in the day when 1-in-3 people you called would talk to you.
1322016870619402240 2020-10-30 11:25:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @durnkest @DeplorableNEET @SelimSeesYou Oh, he was, sorry. I didn't realize that rally had Biden there too.
1322016658182053890 2020-10-30 11:25:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly Baris doesn't weight by party. He weights by other factors and he thinks that should end up getting you the right party affiliate for the electorate that will actually show up.
1322016338756444160 2020-10-30 11:23:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DeplorableNEET @durnkest @SelimSeesYou The Biden campaign seems to have completely given up on Florida. I can't believe they would think it's in the bag for them.
1322015394459230211 2020-10-30 11:20:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @eye_idol Yeah, Dem turnout is really hurting with all this diminished activity in their mass vote busing centers.
1322015180285448193 2020-10-30 11:19:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Yes.
1322014897761357824 2020-10-30 11:18:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @eye_idol Last weekend they did souls to the polls in Florida and....Republicans outnumbered Dems at the polls that day (though, it was the closest day of IPEV in Florida so far).
1322013936682754048 2020-10-30 11:14:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @durnkest @SelimSeesYou I'd be more concerned if Biden call a lid on Sunday, only to suddenly begin campaigning again the next day in all the swing states, including Biden+Obama on Saturday night in Detroit, Michigan. They seem to think this is where the election is at too.
1322013253124427777 2020-10-30 11:11:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume The 1980 one is awesome. 1984 is kind of boring, I got to say "Reagan wins, oh Reagan wins again, oh, look, he won that other state over there."
1322012653510893568 2020-10-30 11:09:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I feel like he's hitting PA enough to already be into diminishing returns.
1322012310811140096 2020-10-30 11:07:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Good point about the Senate races. Need to make sure the GOP is positioned strongly there. Those might both go to a runoff, but it would be nice if Perdue bags his without one as that should depress Dem turnout in the runoff (they're a very fickle people).
1322010572402102274 2020-10-30 11:00:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The only even slightly concerning stop is Georgia, but that state is just getting closer potentially because of the demos. Ending in Michigan is definitely a campaign on the attack. In 08, both campaigns ended in Virginia, signaling McCain's desperation to hold on there.
1322009493769736194 2020-10-30 10:56:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 Maybe. Obviously there were some, but that small of a sample is rather hard to find.
1322009228421271559 2020-10-30 10:55:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IndependentUnd1 I'm using TargetSmart:  https://t.co/SEfpHoqFnY
1322008838564945920 2020-10-30 10:54:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 The bad news is the proportion of Males:Females is the same: Black men voted 14% for Trump. Pew couldn't find a Black female who did.
1322008335361675264 2020-10-30 10:52:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Pew had Blacks at 10% of the turnout (I suspect they were higher). Nationally they are currently at 8.4%.
1322007886659276801 2020-10-30 10:50:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SR71999 Nate Silver's whole model is that the only numbers that matter are the top lines of polls and averaging them out using his increasingly arbitrary polling grades. His operation has also grown increasingly partisan since 2012 (this started before Trump).
1322007288174006289 2020-10-30 10:47:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> LA Time: Young people driving record voting.   Real life: 18-29 year olds are 11% of the vote. Pew Estimates they were 13% of the 2016 Electorate.
1322006771993661441 2020-10-30 10:45:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SmrtFrijoles @SelimSeesYou It's exaggerated by the scale used.
1322006109461323782 2020-10-30 10:43:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SR71999 Literally every poll everywhere is showing the election day margins are 2:1 greater for Trump. Less than 20% of Biden voters intend to vote on Election Day.
1322005910592671744 2020-10-30 10:42:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheCatchFence @LarrySchweikart Percentages matter less when a higher share of the vote is in. That split was, overall, 30-42 or so.
1322004398453784577 2020-10-30 10:36:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If this election day vote terns out to be 2:1 Trump as everyone is expecting, this is going to go pretty well.
1322003813285437441 2020-10-30 10:34:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAFoshee @RedEaglePatriot @realikamusume It's definitely looking a lot better for the GOP this year. They might yet narrow the gap in terms of registered voters as well.
1322002834943053824 2020-10-30 10:30:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAFoshee @RedEaglePatriot @realikamusume In terms of registered party, which is on the Secretary of State's site, the Dems have a 40K advantage currently.
1321999379721498630 2020-10-30 10:16:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The Top Battlegrounds should be closer in RCP because MN is closer than WI in the average and same EVs.

1321968787185410053 2020-10-30 08:14:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Michigan will save this campaign yet again!
1321967402163253248 2020-10-30 08:09:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brettbjj_brett @realikamusume Yeah, this polling narrative only developed in the wake of Nate Plastic’s “data revolution” that predicted one of the most easily predictable elections of the modern era. You didn’t need polls to tell you Obama was basically a shoe in barring some crazy scandal.
1321966317054865408 2020-10-30 08:05:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp In fact, it skips the Vice Presidency and goes straight Barron should Trump departs this mortal coil.
1321966127803736064 2020-10-30 08:04:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat Horrifying.
1321965819308507142 2020-10-30 08:03:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I know we repealed a a Constitutional amendment to let Trump reign indefinitely, but we’re right this time. Everyone hates Trump now.
1321965117823688705 2020-10-30 08:00:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Yes, I’ve heard of all the non college Whites men who are just itching to vote Biden.
1321964748754309120 2020-10-30 07:58:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark They literally fudged their numbers to make it look better after the fact and they call you some kind conspiracy kook if you just link the way back machine.
1321964458705592326 2020-10-30 07:57:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 110%
1321963785905704961 2020-10-30 07:55:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Tina Smith is going down.
1321962267966164993 2020-10-30 07:49:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roark1Jacob @realikamusume That’s what it feels like is happening over the course of the week. Trump is making a strong closing case and Biden isn’t even making a case.
1321958150422073344 2020-10-30 07:32:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp That is definitely what happened: they expected Trump to only get good news and it has happened. Part of the reason they force cancelled the second debate: They were trying to lock in shaky voters. I don’t think they did enough.
1321957171647680512 2020-10-30 07:28:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Even in the golden era of polling, polls were 2 or 3 days behind the race. The Trumpmentum in the approval ratings today would be leading indicators for a genuine old school election watcher instead of the new school data nerd.
1321952578909908992 2020-10-30 07:10:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Note about Nevada: It’s the only of the swing states where Dems won E-Day vote in 2016. This is because of Strip Employees getting bussed to the polls by the Unions. There are a lot fewer of these this year. That alone could be the margin.
1321951303149494272 2020-10-30 07:05:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NOTBillMitchell @MccreightDave @RalstonReports @Barnes_Law Apparently it didn’t in Nevada and this year the voting intention is crazy disproportionate. With a statewide 4.5% gap, if that holds, we probably won’t be able to call Nevada night of and if Trump carries NPAs it will be very close. And the gap could still narrow.
1321949531190239233 2020-10-30 06:58:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NOTBillMitchell @MccreightDave @RalstonReports @Barnes_Law Because statewide the gap is smaller proportionately? There are votes outside Clark County. Also, with the disproportionate nature of voting intentions this year, and fewer culinary union employees, we expect the GOP to narrow the gap even more on Election Day itself.
1321943920218116096 2020-10-30 06:36:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jSinSaTx @SelimSeesYou I agree, but we’re at the point now they’re giving us no means of redress and just baldly usurping the whole process. At what point is a democratic government just illegitimate? It’s not quite the same thing as a usurper on the throne, but that’s what it feels like.
1321942427305955328 2020-10-30 06:30:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FowlesMurphy @CocosPatient @SelimSeesYou @Peoples_Pundit They basically stole 4 seats in California too. Full court press they had and they still only had a slightly above average year in the House.  I still blame Republicans for not FIXING HEALTHCARE. Seriously, guys? You'd been promising that for SEVEN YEARS!
1321941354365263873 2020-10-30 06:25:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @martok112 @TRElections @SelbJim A gallup poll had him up 10: 54-44 two weeks before that. All the polls did. It was a tie ball game at that point. I don't think there's any world McCain pulls it off, but that campaign was embarrassing. He didn't have to take 8 Senators with him.
1321940600980230146 2020-10-30 06:22:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheSadKot @SelimSeesYou &gt;Guy who doesn't accept the legitimacy of our institutions is angry some other people are starting to agree.   Ok.
1321940457019056129 2020-10-30 06:22:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou People need to think more about this: At what point do we just accept that our institutions aren't legitimate? I mean, Democratic governors are using the power of their office to spread panic among their populations and attempting to evade court orders and shit. It's crazy.
1321939843396620288 2020-10-30 06:19:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cyncical @RalstonReports @Barnes_Law I've been following this everyday. The statewide lead was 7% over the weekend and I just checked and now it's 4.5%.
1321938102760411138 2020-10-30 06:12:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CelticRoman8 Nevada NPAs historically favored the GOP, but have swung towards Dems in recent years. Think they could swing back because of Sisolak and Biden's lockdown policies. Vegas cannot afford a Biden Admin.
1321937613029298185 2020-10-30 06:11:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BryceVegas702 @NOTBillMitchell @MccreightDave @RalstonReports @Barnes_Law That's because the culinary unions usually drive their people to the polls. I wonder how that will workout with so many fewer Strip Employees on duty. Not sure they're too happy with Dems shutting down their jobs either.
1321937375405232128 2020-10-30 06:10:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cyncical @RalstonReports @Barnes_Law Sir, this is Twitter. You only have so many characters. He linked the article. If you want to get a full picture, you can go over there. And the fact of the matter is the GOP is narrowing the gap everyday in the in person voting.
1321936762239897610 2020-10-30 06:07:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FerranteGiants Cool! Hope it does. They only had about 89K ballot requests, which should bode well for the GOP's prospects there if they can drive up E-Day turnout.
1321935941246849025 2020-10-30 06:04:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Anyone paying any attention to Lehigh County in Pennsylvania? Narrowly went for Clinton, but seems like the type of place that should favor Trump. Pretty vote rich, could offset any losses in the Philly burbs.
1321934707655876613 2020-10-30 05:59:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Dude, that's up 3% in Gallup from last time. This is swinging HARD towards Trump even in the polls. Gallup would probably have a tie ball game right now if they still did a topline.
1321934329723977729 2020-10-30 05:57:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dems are going to need NPAs or fraud ballots in NV and that's just a fact.
1321933819746856962 2020-10-30 05:55:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NOTBillMitchell @MccreightDave @RalstonReports @Barnes_Law Republicans have won the Election Day vote in virtually every election it was a thing and they continue to narrow the gap everyday. With a disproportionate number of Republicans, even compared to prior years, waiting until day of, They're in good shape. Dems need to Indies.
1321932437845323782 2020-10-30 05:50:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MccreightDave @RalstonReports @Barnes_Law So the polls were wrong when they said Democrats would disproportionately vote early? Republicans are flat out winning among same day registrants in Nevada right now. That's just a fact. Lots of good signs for Nevada if they get their people out on Election Day like expected.
1321932054120943617 2020-10-30 05:48:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cyncical @RalstonReports @Barnes_Law It's more down by 7, dude. We're talking about a one possession game. Anyone can check the registration data.
1321931078869929984 2020-10-30 05:45:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf How dare you notice my own model says 41% of the National electorate is Republican so far when we predicted it would be 32% max!
1321929919170023427 2020-10-30 05:40:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Lefties get really angry when you take their raw data and interpret it a different way than they do.

1321929110348828683 2020-10-30 05:37:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NickGreenwald @RalstonReports @Barnes_Law So?
1321928646353891329 2020-10-30 05:35:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RalstonReports @Barnes_Law He literally just quoted you.
1321928495379947521 2020-10-30 05:34:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cole45458208 For re-election, you’re correct.

1321925983876898817 2020-10-30 05:24:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cole45458208 Yeah, I don’t get it at this point. Like Trump consistently has 90+% approval ratings in the GOP.
1321925062447038464 2020-10-30 05:21:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation Ivanka would have no traction with the base. Don, Jr. would, but then he'd flame out because he's awful.
1321924687618805760 2020-10-30 05:19:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Are the doomers really thinking 20% of modeled Republicans are defecting with no pickups of NPAs and Dems?
1321924448925192193 2020-10-30 05:18:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Trump voters on the margins have reported slightly higher intentions to vote early in person, but not enough to offset the swamping that appears to be coming on Election Day. Nearly every poll has it 2:1 at least. 50 million election day votes would Net Trump more than 15 million
1321923069766705153 2020-10-30 05:13:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TRElections @SelbJim Part of what made Nate Silver famous was discrediting said internals.
1321922768712146944 2020-10-30 05:12:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TRElections @SelbJim In late October, McCain was pushing internals that had him only down by 6 in Pennsylvania.
1321921216949747713 2020-10-30 05:05:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TRElections @LuisBobby3 MontCo Karens disproportionately said they'd vote by mail: 274,665 requests. Clinton got 256,082 votes in that county. They're going to need more people out on E-Day than said would go.
1321920473366671361 2020-10-30 05:02:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChaserWestbrook Yeah, it's probably going to come down to the wire.
1321920131279323137 2020-10-30 05:01:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TRElections @LuisBobby3 Dude, it's happening. I don't know what more evidence you need that these polls are trash. The early vote looks NOTHING like what they expected across the board. Half the vote was supposed to be in PA before E-Day: Even if they returned EVERY ballot that wouldn't be the case.
1321919290757517312 2020-10-30 04:58:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @emolaborunion @SelimSeesYou He was in NH on Saturday.
1321919064936226816 2020-10-30 04:57:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 I don't get it: I was looking at some numbers today and there are signs that we're looking at a wave in rural areas for Trump. Well more than enough to offset some small losses in Philly suburbs, if those happen.
1321918765760655362 2020-10-30 04:56:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW I tend to buy DI this cycle, but they did do that Trump+5 last time and a lot of people just don't buy it because of that. Not that it's fair: Same people won't trash D positive polls.
1321918008563040258 2020-10-30 04:53:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Your daily reminder that PA Dems regularly have the highest defection rates for Democrats outside the South.
1321917808935055360 2020-10-30 04:52:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cole45458208 @RealAPolitics This is an interesting factor: The "modeled" party is a significantly smaller gap than the registration advantage and this fits PA historically.
1321915566484017152 2020-10-30 04:43:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @VeryLegalGenius @Rrawa9857 @davidchapman141 He thinks it's all about PA. He's probably right. He still has a very close race in MI and WI, though, could definitely tip back to Trump. He's less bullish on MI because of Whitmer's propagandizing.
1321915099829968896 2020-10-30 04:41:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Yeah, but Republicans are boycotting mail voting in PA. Doesn't make any sense.
1321914932988940288 2020-10-30 04:40:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @VeryLegalGenius @Rrawa9857 @davidchapman141 I don't remember an exact time, feel like it was about halfway through.

1321914433560600576 2020-10-30 04:38:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rrawa9857 @davidchapman141 On his show tonight.
1321912725396664322 2020-10-30 04:32:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 We cancelled our primary otherwise I would have.
1321911993046097927 2020-10-30 04:29:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Reminder: 18.1 million voted for Trump in the primaries just to get high from checking his name.
1321907799333457932 2020-10-30 04:12:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cummymonke @SelimSeesYou Do people like this understand how historically abnormal they are? Do they understand why people fought wars in the past? The issues at stake almost seem petty to those at stake now.
1321906713591767040 2020-10-30 04:08:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics You hedging, bro?
1321900511059156992 2020-10-30 03:43:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer I still don't get why he's using his courtroom defendant pic for his profile.
1321899269759139840 2020-10-30 03:38:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PianistF I don't know, but I'm just convinced we're looking at the biggest polling miss ever and the signs pointing to it are inside the polls themselves.
1321898284764594177 2020-10-30 03:34:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @briangobosox @JoesBarAndCult @SelimSeesYou Yeah, it's just absolutely nuts. There's no way Biden is doing that well among people that already have voted and every poll has him crushing with those who haven't.
1321897136913600512 2020-10-30 03:30:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> What happened to Biden's lid? Like, I heard he was so far ahead Sunday night he didn't even want to campaign?
1321896559349534721 2020-10-30 03:27:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads No way Messner is running ahead of Trump and Sununu is going to win by double digits.
1321896417439424513 2020-10-30 03:27:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Been totally out of the tech loop because of the election: Apparently Big Navi was real? Am I hearing this right? I'm so accustomed to disappointment with AMD video card products.
1321895566931091458 2020-10-30 03:23:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee There needs to be a reckoning after this election. This is the craziest shit you've ever seen.

1321894687351951362 2020-10-30 03:20:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 @Barnes_Law @NateSilver538 Dem voters will believe anything. They'll think Governor Tom Wolf and Gretchen Whitmer are involved in a conspiracy with Trump if the media told them to.
1321894293846589443 2020-10-30 03:18:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks @thehangingchads @NateSilver538 @Nate_Cohn @Redistrict I don't even know what to make of this data at this point. Like, it almost seems too good to be true for Republicans.
1321894156244029442 2020-10-30 03:18:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JoesBarAndCult @SelimSeesYou The 58-39 number is from Monmouth. The D-R-I split I posted is state data.
1321893318511464449 2020-10-30 03:15:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JoesBarAndCult @SelimSeesYou Not sure what you mean.
1321893176043622405 2020-10-30 03:14:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BibMccafferty @SelimSeesYou Probably in that neighborhood. Even being conservative at 90 and this poll is nuts, though. Trump would have to get less than 10% of the combined non-Republican vote.
1321892863756718089 2020-10-30 03:13:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JoesBarAndCult @SelimSeesYou Florida had a Republican primary on March 17th. Trump got 93.8% of the vote at that primary. Like, even assuming 10% defection is rather high.
1321892503424028678 2020-10-30 03:11:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JoesBarAndCult @SelimSeesYou Just what needs to happen for his poll to be right among already voteds to make sense. 37.4% of the voters so far are registered Republicans. If they're 90% loyal, 34% of the vote so far is Trump Republicans. That means Trump would have to get less than 10% of non-Republicans.
1321891167760457730 2020-10-30 03:06:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Either mass Republican defection or Biden is winning NPAs 90-10. We're talking like 25% defection rates.
1321890706227662848 2020-10-30 03:04:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Like, you know how much defection this would require, and all one way?
1321890275976007683 2020-10-30 03:02:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Monmouth: "More than half (58%) of registered voters in Florida report having already cast their ballots. Biden leads among this group by 59% to 39%."  Early vote current 41-37-20 D-R-NPA. LMAO.
1321888243185573888 2020-10-30 02:54:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law @SelimSeesYou @NateSilver538 It's going to be even quicker this time when Miami-Dade dumps its votes and it's clear the margin is like two thirds of what it was last time. They'll hold off calling it until the numbers from Hillsborough are laughable for them too.
1321886931832180736 2020-10-30 02:49:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "We can't call the election. We know Trump is ahead by 35%, but we swear our boy Joe won the early vote by dictator numbers!"
1321886586896850948 2020-10-30 02:48:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This crap doesn't make any sense. Like, we will know roughly how many people voted and the crazy suspicious margins Dems will need to pull it off in these states.
1321885520541196290 2020-10-30 02:44:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @NateSilver538 @Nate_Cohn @Redistrict It makes all their crazy turnout models with high youth and minority turnout models make sense.
1321885310779858944 2020-10-30 02:43:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @NateSilver538 @Nate_Cohn @Redistrict I'm doing the math on this and I'm just convinced they're completely missing 20-30 million votes and these votes are like 90% Trump.
1321884899356323840 2020-10-30 02:41:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat I think Nate's model would make a lot more sense if you just locked in states that have no real chance of flipping.
1321883580247744512 2020-10-30 02:36:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @yemanouspeak Given how lopsided Election Day turnout is looking to be, and the fact we will need a surge of youth vote on Election Day to reach anywhere near historical norms, I think we will end up with an historically high GOP share among young voters. Not win them, but high share.
1321880421131603970 2020-10-30 02:23:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads If these polls are still kind of right on this at this late hour, I honestly think they could be missing tens of million of Trump votes totally.
1321880177157246976 2020-10-30 02:22:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The thing is: TLP people used to *run the Republican Party*. People like Greenwald never did that.
1321879367191068675 2020-10-30 02:19:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I honestly think Quinn is just totally fake numbers. Even more fake than anything you can throw at Rasmussen.
1321879058620260353 2020-10-30 02:18:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Wait, 13% not voting major party with 5 days left to go? IN FLORIDA? No.
1321874581074944001 2020-10-30 02:00:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @yemanouspeak I agree, there's something definitely off somewhere. There's definitely a piece of this puzzle missing. We've seen very consistent polling that the Election Day vote will favor Trump, though. No poll has found otherwise, even ones with Trump down double digits.
1321873968433946631 2020-10-30 01:58:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @baalwark Either way, this poll makes no sense with the numbers we're seeing in terms of the early vote. Like, we're going to hit max 100 million by Election Day. 50 million votes 2:1 Trump supporters is like a net 15 million votes.
1321872597647319041 2020-10-30 01:52:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 If it's really true there's an army of Trump supporters waiting to head to the polls on Election Day, we could be missing like 20 million votes in this poll. I don't know if I really believe that.
1321872368713764865 2020-10-30 01:51:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If we're going to get to 150 million votes, we need to have 40% of the vote turn up on election day with 90 million votes in the bank early. Like, this poll's numbers just don't add up in terms of turnout at this point.
1321871793930543104 2020-10-30 01:49:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Roland_Gunn2 @AirBossUT5 Reagan played the game when he shouldn't have.
1321871672606076930 2020-10-30 01:49:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Even if you assume everyone who isn't a Republican is voting Biden, that gives Trump 28,543,958 votes to Biden's 40.2 or so. Assume Trump hits 35 and Biden hits 50 before election day, This would put the race at dead even. It would also be a shockingly low turnout, though.
1321868936498073603 2020-10-30 01:38:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 Reagan made a poor pick with Bush. I think Pence is much better.
1321868479260217347 2020-10-30 01:36:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Minnesota isn't in play!
1321867647710015489 2020-10-30 01:33:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried I just don't know how someone can recover from a 10 point polling error. That's well within the margin of most major elections.
1321865672901668869 2020-10-30 01:25:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan I mean, their own polls expected this. I don't understand why they're acting surprised. The only thing they weren't expecting was the Republicans to show up once in person voting started up.
1321864844463714304 2020-10-30 01:21:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 I was kind of hoping we'd be rid of her while gaining seats.
1321864345215795202 2020-10-30 01:19:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Trump Army!
1321864149744422914 2020-10-30 01:19:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Hint: If the early vote is a larger percentage of the overall vote, it matters less what percentage of the early vote is any particular demographic.
1321863647115857920 2020-10-30 01:17:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joshualucas Combine that with the fact Republicans are set to overwhelm the Election Day vote.
1321863513808211969 2020-10-30 01:16:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joshualucas That doesn’t matter when a larger percentage of the vote is early. Old people have voted early for a long time, especially in Florida.
1321863045308710914 2020-10-30 01:14:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @asiandunce @Summerterrace1 You mean decrease?
1321859774728777728 2020-10-30 01:01:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is key because the Democrats were hoping to lock up this key senior coronavirus voting group before the argument can really be fleshed out. Now that the mood has swung against them on this issue, I just don’t think they banked enough of the swing votes in this group.
1321859481710592005 2020-10-30 01:00:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just don’t know how you can get around that this electorate so far is older, Whiter, and more Republican than the polls anticipated. This is especially important as seniors have swung towards the President by all signs. The votes in the key swing states are lagging too: Key.
1321858701490343946 2020-10-30 00:57:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation Proprietary Colonial Government was underrated.
1321855691892678665 2020-10-30 00:45:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Summerterrace1 @SelbJim He's getting nervous. Perfectly normal at this late stage. I'd certainly much rather be 5 points ahead in the polls, but we have all the momentum and everything else.
1321855301667217413 2020-10-30 00:43:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @realikamusume He noticed it was Blacks over the age of 65. Not really sure how this group votes. It was basically Biden's only loyal support base in the primaries. Overall, it still appears Trump will get a larger share of the minority vote on a smaller turnout. A large net gain for him.
1321853958902730752 2020-10-30 00:38:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @Summerterrace1 All narrow and he's bullish on a PA win despite being an inch behind.
1321853822130479104 2020-10-30 00:38:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Blacks were at 23% of the electorate when Obama lost North Carolina in 2012 (people keep saying he won it in 2012, but this is incorrect).
1321852867339292673 2020-10-30 00:34:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Been noticing this, yet Tom "Here's How Biden Can Still Win" Bonier thinks minority turnout is going to be up. LMAO.
1321852572165091328 2020-10-30 00:33:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Summerterrace1 @SelbJim Baris has Biden 2 points ahead in Michigan. Calm yourself.
1321852134019747846 2020-10-30 00:31:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> At this point, MN and WI were lean blue. They're currently tossups.
1321851819681861632 2020-10-30 00:30:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @billsretpal Yeah, the only standout is that TX was lean read as was GA. Other than that, basically the same. Of course, they also had MI, WI, and MN as lean blue and they're tossups now, so?
1321851453867200513 2020-10-30 00:28:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> He was doing a bit better in the no tossup camp, but the Ohio and Iowa polls are far more scant this cycle. Difficult to fully compare.
1321850890542895112 2020-10-30 00:26:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @billsretpal Now:  https://t.co/UNjDYisHKb  Nov. 3 2016:  https://t.co/PgBQicT6uJ
1321849562668191745 2020-10-30 00:21:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law @NateSilver538 The CNN Biden+10 in PA is falling off. Expect some crazy Biden+12 poll claiming Biden's fracking comments helped him with all the environmentalists in the PA T.
1321849257033347072 2020-10-30 00:19:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This firm has Biden 9 ahead in TX, but only 5 ahead in PA. Oh, yeah, and Jorgenson lmao.
1321848913582841856 2020-10-30 00:18:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The RCP map is basically what it looked like at this time in 2016.
1321848629502660613 2020-10-30 00:17:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jonas_thelion @quantuspolling @drfozzarelli That's what it looks like to me, but max 100 EV and 60 on EDay. Higher EV means lower EDay most likely. Trump should win EDay by 2:1 basically everywhere.
1321848214853738496 2020-10-30 00:15:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PumpknSpiceSoul @Barnes_Law The ship on this has sailed. The government bureaucrats (I think on purpose) lost credibility when they extended shutdowns beyond mid-April. If they had transitioned to "Normalcy+Masks" by then, the public would have accepted it. It's not the public's job to believe experts.
1321846728157548546 2020-10-30 00:09:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads In order for them to be winning, they need to be getting about 60% of those Indie votes.
1321846496782942209 2020-10-30 00:08:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Including in Clark County, man. CLARK COUNTY
1321841997351690241 2020-10-29 23:51:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TennentsPlease No, there's a large group of NPAs in Clark County as well, but of the people that did choose an affiliation, Republicans are ahead by a relatively significant margin as of yesterday.
1321841831710216195 2020-10-29 23:50:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago Honestly think Nevada might just get swamped with GOP ballots. Like, these people are pissed about lockdowns and Trump has been running against them. It's their last chance to save their jobs.
1321840964344909824 2020-10-29 23:46:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just don't know how you can spin more same day registrants choosing Republican party affiliation over Democrat in Clark County, Nevada. This isn't how this was supposed to work.
1321840599130116100 2020-10-29 23:45:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAFoshee They just don't have enough non-partisans banked for their team in any case.
1321840076515647490 2020-10-29 23:43:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BibMccafferty @realikamusume At the same time, if there's a shy Trump vote, it's among suburban men and women in states like PA and GA.
1321839469465608192 2020-10-29 23:41:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Ford had an even rougher primary and was able to rally his base more than Carter was.
1321839212434513921 2020-10-29 23:40:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dems: "The US is doing so much worse than Europe in the pandemic!"  Europe: Hits case records, shuts down again, truly draconian measures promised.
1321838866937106434 2020-10-29 23:38:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume The only time since we have data I can identify a larger crossover R-&gt;D vote was Clinton 1992 and Bush had a relatively rough primary and abysmal party approval ratings. Neither of which happened for Trump.
1321831724796489729 2020-10-29 23:10:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Tom "Here's how Biden can still win" Bonier.
1321817864685408259 2020-10-29 22:15:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Down the line the left takes basically the same approach to all data: Takes some headlines and blast it out with your philosophical spin pre-attached.
1321815927772614656 2020-10-29 22:07:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 It's like the top line of polls is a religion. "Who they're voting for is accurate, but who cares whatever else they say?"
1321815090073640963 2020-10-29 22:04:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume If the early vote drops over 40%, I don't see how Trump loses the election.
1321813425505345537 2020-10-29 21:57:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Americans have absolutely no idea how taxes work.
1321812937212907522 2020-10-29 21:55:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Quick! Media better produce another fake PA poll before their fake CNN Biden+10 poll drops off and Trump climbs higher in the average.
1321812315000446976 2020-10-29 21:53:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I was informed that Trump's lockdown, which was totally necessary and, in fact, "the science," would cause a permanent economic depression, never to be recovered from because Trump's lockdown would be worse than Biden's lockdown because reasons.
1321810277688639488 2020-10-29 21:45:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BorealReinhard @SelimSeesYou Their methodology is to discourage Trump voters and excite Biden's.
1321810142971809793 2020-10-29 21:44:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation @SelimSeesYou Also, you'd be totally right to just trash this poll. I don't think RCP is even going to publish it.

1321809029417603074 2020-10-29 21:40:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Even Sherman thinks this ain't real:  https://t.co/NL8kE7dq3t
1321806325488209922 2020-10-29 21:29:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim Apparently the evil racists Whites hate evil racist Trump now because of his evil racism?   I'm so confused as to the narrative at this point. Only way Trump loses is a huge White vote swing against him at this point.

1321798152161239041 2020-10-29 20:56:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> GDP soars. Oh, look, another reason Dems wanted to have a bunch of potential swing votes banked before the election.
1321699141655928835 2020-10-29 14:23:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If Texans were thinking about voting Democrat, how did Trump get nearly as many votes as all the Democrats combined in a basically uncontested primary?
1321691283879038976 2020-10-29 13:52:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @smileefase1 @FreeNortherner Driving down Biden’s numbers among young people can only be good and Trump will never face the voters again. He has credibility on the issue because he has extended payment and forgiven Rona interest.

1321673627230703624 2020-10-29 12:42:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing What we're really seeing in the battle of Trump vs. The State is the battle of traditional human leadership versus this technocratic dystopia the Neo-Marxist left has in store for us.
1321672798499123200 2020-10-29 12:38:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I want to organize an army of Christmas Carolers to descend on Sacramento just to piss this guy off.
1321672419036270592 2020-10-29 12:37:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 Literally all signs besides fake news polls point to an army of backwoods Trumpists descending on polls on Election Day like a conquering army.
1321672144510734336 2020-10-29 12:36:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Can you believe this crap? When Trump wins next week, I honestly think some of these governors should be thrown in jail.
1321670665930461185 2020-10-29 12:30:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Similar story in another high return rate neighboring county: Wyoming. These are places with likely high rates of Dem crossover too.
1321669638791614465 2020-10-29 12:26:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If more than half of the Biden vote is in already, then Biden might get like half the votes Clinton got in this county.
1321669397170298880 2020-10-29 12:25:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I checked out the county with the highest ballot return rate in Pennsylvania: It's a rural County named Sullivan. Majority of the votes are registered Ds, but a majority of the first time votes are Republicans.....
1321668615633014784 2020-10-29 12:22:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @CottoGottfried I don't get these people that think she's a secret Lib. Like, even if she voted McMullin doesn't mean she'd make a bad Justice. Just a complete confusion of what the conservative legal movement is about. Roberts wasn't actually a member of the conservative legal movement.
1321668053273366531 2020-10-29 12:19:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @CottoGottfried Sick of these people. We got what we needed already. The case is moot pretty much already with the way ballot returns are going there.
1321666321596194816 2020-10-29 12:13:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DrinkinAbraham @Barnes_Law It's just obviously not serious when you have Biden 2 points ahead in Louisiana, but Trump 2 points ahead in Minnesota.
1321666138141528064 2020-10-29 12:12:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Did he really remove *all* ads. People keep seeing these media buy headlines that are actually just typical shuffling of resources.
1321665823312957440 2020-10-29 12:11:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I thought the President caused this plot.
1321664519404457992 2020-10-29 12:05:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Historically speaking, since we have data basically, Democrats have been far less loyal than Republicans. There have been a few elections that wasn't the case. Even McCain won a larger percentage of Dems than Obama won of Republicans.
1321662733243265027 2020-10-29 11:58:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Ok, everyone has this now. Even YouGov's consumer panel surveys.
1321661949952856069 2020-10-29 11:55:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 LOL, Georgia.
1321661755446251528 2020-10-29 11:54:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 Watch George randomly flip blue this cycle while the rest of the country is a sea of red.
1321659498155618305 2020-10-29 11:45:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you replaced WI with MN as a "top battleground" (a state with the same EVs), Biden would lose about .3% of his edge.
1321658215839502337 2020-10-29 11:40:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 My parents would listen to Michael Savage on the radio when I was a kid. I've basically believed the same things since then politically.
1321657945415917568 2020-10-29 11:39:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I always ran a traditional campaign pandering to everyone in every state while collecting huge sums of cash in California.
1321657702452465675 2020-10-29 11:38:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 It's closer to 1860. Abraham Lincoln would have won the electoral college even if there was only one other candidate because he got literally 0 votes in most of the South. Lincoln won a majority of the vote in enough states, if barely.
1321657081422848000 2020-10-29 11:36:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 I remember when I was a kid in 2004, there was a national straw poll in our "school network" (I have no idea how this worked) over gay marriage. The people who presented the results were visibly disappointed when the result was 66% opposed across 100K students.
1321656183585951746 2020-10-29 11:32:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp That is not a challenge I ever took up in Political Machine. Sounds like fun, though.
1321655548924841986 2020-10-29 11:30:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you won these states by 1 vote, and 0 votes in the others, you could win the election with about 25% of the popular vote theoretically.  https://t.co/sl9ldwaxra
1321653997808295937 2020-10-29 11:24:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV Dude, Casey is a popular guy in Pennsylvania and Barletta just was never going to get there.
1321653033919533056 2020-10-29 11:20:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 @Barnes_Law Trump gets his 270th EV from stuffing ballot boxes in DC....hilarious.
1321652216059539459 2020-10-29 11:16:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law Dude, this is a troll. They also have Louisiana as a tie and Minnesota as lean Trump.
1321648810532069377 2020-10-29 11:03:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 The first sign of this was seniors coming home in Florida, a senior state as America's honorary retirement home. That was with Ron DeSantis lifting all the restrictions.
1321648447796187136 2020-10-29 11:01:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 It's one reason why I was never really worried about the older polls. I was like "are conservative seniors really going to cast their vote for Joe Biden at the end of the day because they're afraid of rona? I'm calling BS." People are bad at predicting their future behavior.
1321647427951202304 2020-10-29 10:57:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's a SurveyMonkey poll, so grain of salt, but still it just seems like the mood on this has shifted drastically over the past month. People are really sick of rona fearmongering.
1321647084127268865 2020-10-29 10:56:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I found this of interesting from early September and it might explain why the national mood on lockdowns seems to have shifted drastically since Trump decided to concertedly oppose them as part of his campaign:  https://t.co/X9q2mcUQou
1321646637232590851 2020-10-29 10:54:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @eye_idol @17cShyteposter Speaking of this, I was digging around for rona info because the national mood on this seems to have shifted drastically of late (we're sick of it and just don't care anymore). Seems to back the idea people trust Trump deep down on rona:  https://t.co/X9q2mcUQou
1321646318331269121 2020-10-29 10:53:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Duke_Libertas Then there's this from early September, which is kind of bizarre and probably explains why Trump's tone on the issue has shifted national opinion on it:  https://t.co/X9q2mcUQou
1321646097106874371 2020-10-29 10:52:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Duke_Libertas Rasmussen had a poll out that 60% of people opposed further lockdowns two weeks ago. Even if Rasmussen is off, that's a big majority. Trying to find a similar poll from around the beginning of October that had it 5 points under water:  https://t.co/c4hPAk4sss
1321644713057964037 2020-10-29 10:47:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Duke_Libertas That poll among others. Also, lockdowns have collapsed in popularity over the last month. Lockdowns and more mandates just aren't as popular as they were before. Trump's message on it was on point last debate.
1321641563601195010 2020-10-29 10:34:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @17cShyteposter I've never seen anything like this. Even 2016 wasn't like this: Yeah, I felt Trump would get a hidden bump from some backwoods voters in the rust belt, but nothing like what it feels like right now.
1321637670309810177 2020-10-29 10:19:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 Oh, I absolutely agree, but I think on general principle voting should be done on Election Day. It's important for the national psyche that most votes be cast after a full debate is had and all the twist and turns of a campaign are accounted for.
1321637248048205824 2020-10-29 10:17:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> National modeled party gap is down to 7.9% on TargetSmart. Registered party gap is narrowing too.
1321636682966487040 2020-10-29 10:15:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @17cShyteposter Doesn't she question the polls when she can't so much as find a living Biden supporter on the Internet, where they seem to reside?
1321635639130001408 2020-10-29 10:11:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim Minnesota!
1321635109196496896 2020-10-29 10:08:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I can vaguely understand on democratic principles pushing easier access to the polls through widespread availability of early voting. What I do not understand is pushing it like voting on Election Day doesn't count or something. Seems suspicious to me.
1321634262689394689 2020-10-29 10:05:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAFoshee @realikamusume @nguyenthevote They're not really pacifists. They're anti-nation building. The reason Trump is able to unite them and working class Italians is that he combines the peace inclinations of Nords with the gung ho "I'm gonna kick your ass" of the Italian.
1321632944415526914 2020-10-29 10:00:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Taliaferro_98 I continue to think he's overrated. Honestly, @BillOReilly had better Talking Points memos on immigration back in the day.
1321631868094173185 2020-10-29 09:56:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @neolib_fanfic @SelimSeesYou The first political belief I remember having is that we needed to build a wall on the Mexican border. You can imagine why I've been a pretty loyal Trump supporter since the escalator (he literally shocked me into supporting him).
1321628149025775616 2020-10-29 09:41:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 I agree. You can see the signs in his poll of where Trump can grab the rest of the support he needs. Trump's people just need to get to the polls.
1321627844003401731 2020-10-29 09:40:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Shit, I just want to go to a Halloween Party without some crazy Dem police state issuing a citation.
1321627642429407235 2020-10-29 09:39:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Truth finds a way. That's why Dems wanted to stuff ballots like three weeks ago.
1321627343098646529 2020-10-29 09:38:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The gap on coronavirus has really narrowed in the final days of the campaign. There were times last month this was a double digit issue for Biden.
1321624934913855488 2020-10-29 09:28:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee @RiddleguyMan I think that bodes well, though: Trump's people have listened to him saying to vote in person, either early on election day, and they have so so far. Dems might make up for it a bit with some youth and AA turnout, which has been abysmal so far.
1321624676125364224 2020-10-29 09:27:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee @RiddleguyMan I get it: There's always a possibility everyone was wrong about everything and this year has just been bizarre overall. I mean, Republicans have never led Florida in person early voting ever, but this year they're hundreds of thousands ahead. Mail in votes are the exact opposite.
1321622817130106880 2020-10-29 09:20:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @onewalleee I'm not worried too much about it because the GOP has won Election Day voting since Early Vote was a thing.
1321621965938040832 2020-10-29 09:16:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @EMichaelFrens @JayFiveK Mail in vote makes it a bit easier in some states, but in PA you're still limited by the number of people who requested ballots.
1321621449732427777 2020-10-29 09:14:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee @RiddleguyMan Certainly not, but we make fraud harder by keeping our powder dry and showing up in force on Election Day when possible. Don't let them know how many votes they need!
1321620606232780801 2020-10-29 09:11:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 @JayFiveK Oh, that was just a test run. Not the real margin. Who knows, though. I do think in a Trump landslide, Illinois margins narrow to single digits.
1321620209019572224 2020-10-29 09:09:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 @JayFiveK I'm telling you people know the results in Florida and Texas already. Like, there's no way these campaigns don't know where they stand in those places.
1321619664523374592 2020-10-29 09:07:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There are 438,292 mail ballot requests out of 1,100,348 registered voters in Philly. There were 707,631 votes last time and Hillary received 584,025 of them.
1321616727805931520 2020-10-29 08:55:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 That shit is why the SCOTUS reserved the right to retake the case. Yeah, if the race comes down to like a thousand votes and they’re in the mail, it will matter, but if the turnout is what we’re hoping for among the WWC, then it’s just not going to happen.
1321616222992142337 2020-10-29 08:53:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StaresInStoic Republican states get a bonus Senator and 50% more electoral votes.
1321615457179312132 2020-10-29 08:50:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed @RiddleguyMan CNN CONFIRMED FOR WOLF BLITZER SPECIAL
1321615232486297601 2020-10-29 08:50:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan The thing is they’re still going to be more dependent on traditional fraud schemes in Philly. Like, we KNOW how many mail ballots are out in Philly. Nothing ACB could have done to prevent Election Day stuffing standards in Philly.
1321614816826576897 2020-10-29 08:48:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks It’s also the law in North Carolina that it only has to be postmarked: I never thought the appeal would succeed for that reason as well.
1321613989344874496 2020-10-29 08:45:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I don’t understand the same people who think Trump is going to win by a significant margin think Trump is going to be overwhelmed by a few thousand extra votes *maybe* post Election Day in Philly and North Carolina.
1321613428176334848 2020-10-29 08:42:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LovebugMAGA I don’t know, just seems these docs are too valuable to trust to the mail. Stuff randomly disappears because a dude threw it into the wrong pile and stuff like that.
1321612819914252288 2020-10-29 08:40:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LovebugMAGA They did.
1321612765845401601 2020-10-29 08:40:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Hopefully it’s just some kind of sting op.
1321612491118575617 2020-10-29 08:39:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 @Barnes_Law That has been the law there for a long time. Please stop acting like there will a 100K fake mail ballots. They already had to put the request in.
1321612180937203713 2020-10-29 08:37:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 @Barnes_Law NC statute specifically says the ballot only needs to be postmarked by Election Day.
1321611997767704578 2020-10-29 08:37:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ArchibaldLewis5 Hope so.
1321611868499300354 2020-10-29 08:36:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Apparently not.
1321611481394413569 2020-10-29 08:35:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m sorry, I just don’t get this. Why are these people so incompetent? If I had damning docs against the Democratic nominee for President, I would have them personally escorted only by people I trusted.
1321605363884576772 2020-10-29 08:10:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RhinecanthusA @RiddleguyMan @Barnes_Law Barrett can’t rule on anything on which she was sworn if after the hearing and briefs. She can rule on the merits for PA after the election potentially because the merits haven’t been heard.
1321605108438884354 2020-10-29 08:09:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law This is the law in NC.
1321604640610332672 2020-10-29 08:07:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads It’s also the law in North Carolina. The main legal dispute is about PA violating preexisting statute.
1321603379655778304 2020-10-29 08:02:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation Scottish Nationalists since Thatcher took power are complete cringe.
1321603095642689536 2020-10-29 08:01:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @realikamusume It is the law in North Carolina. Not much you can do about that.
1321602954407907331 2020-10-29 08:01:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis It’s just amazing me to me how out of touch Evangelical elites are from people who actually go to Church.
1321602194710450176 2020-10-29 07:58:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat This is funny.
1321601296424730624 2020-10-29 07:54:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis I agree, but it seems to hurt Congressional Republicans more than Trump.
1321601065582792704 2020-10-29 07:53:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed The algorithms are weird. I still get Arabic ads from time to time.
1321600710090366977 2020-10-29 07:52:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Smiller1517 It’s sad actually. So many have lost all credibility in my mind. This started back in the 2016 primaries, though, and in the 2016 General Trump ended up with a historic share of the Evangelical vote, which was also larger share of the vote than ever.
1321599448896704512 2020-10-29 07:47:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump’s going to get like 90% of the Evangelical vote. Most of the reason Evangelicals ever voted Dem was stuff like healthcare anyway and Trump has neutralized stuff like social security and Medicare:  https://t.co/iCKyb9fapU
1321597852020285441 2020-10-29 07:40:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think I’ve watched too much of the Latinos for Donald Trump Ad. Getting Spanish ads now. Surprised how much of the gist I remember from high school.
1321597300226039808 2020-10-29 07:38:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nc_groyp If it comes down to potentially outstanding ballots, there will be an army of Republican lawyers and volunteers who will descend on the state and watch everything.
1321596828110909440 2020-10-29 07:36:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TrustThePlant @RedEaglePatriot Nikki Haley was at less than 10% in the last 2024 primary poll. Please stop buying media memes.
1321596407472685056 2020-10-29 07:35:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There hasn’t been a single policy outline speech this whole election. Trump only gave like one or two in 2016. It’s all about whose team you’re on now.
1321595475913515011 2020-10-29 07:31:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Vote!
1321595382565117952 2020-10-29 07:31:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Wait for Big Data Poll.
1321593478099410951 2020-10-29 07:23:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK People thought Arizona was some NeverTrump stronghold and this dude had to dropout because he’d have gotten like max 20% in the primary. I think one poll had him at 12%.

1321590700237033473 2020-10-29 07:12:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you open up the PA ballot requests on the election github, 311 ballots have already been rejected. For some reason this rate is higher in GOP strongholds than Dem strongholds. I wonder why? Only 1 ballot in Philly has been rejected.
1321589165008605184 2020-10-29 07:06:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume All the disloyal Ds makes that gap not matter as much.
1321588837303406602 2020-10-29 07:05:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Which is why 2020 feels like this thing *might* get settled by a court dispute in early December or worse.
1321588690817327106 2020-10-29 07:04:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed I know it's nuts, but that was one too many historic underdog victories that year for me to not bet Trump was going to pull it off somehow. Kind of felt a bit like we might get steamrolled before that.
1321588061457780737 2020-10-29 07:02:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joshualucas @CottoGottfried @realikamusume Oh, got you. Yeah. That map makes more sense.
1321587424317870081 2020-10-29 06:59:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joshualucas @CottoGottfried @realikamusume I'm still seeing Advantage Trumps there in Lee and Collier. Not seeing a single county with Advantage Biden. Haven't moused over all them, though.
1321586522185994243 2020-10-29 06:55:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics This is one of the few times in recent history when the Dems won the crossover vote.
1321586184343195648 2020-10-29 06:54:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joshualucas @CottoGottfried @realikamusume It just seems a bit too good to be true. Even in Broward, the GOP overperforms early vote on Election Day (they still lose, obviously).
1321584943634522112 2020-10-29 06:49:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried @realikamusume Uh...That's not what the site says.

1321583046919917568 2020-10-29 06:42:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Calm down everyone.
1321581315381170176 2020-10-29 06:35:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Sk9077809128 It’s Friday.
1321581264776830976 2020-10-29 06:35:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> More Trumpmentum and more reason why they wanted to bank their low propensity and leaners through their VBM scam.
1321580998455427073 2020-10-29 06:33:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We still haven’t had Q3 GDP drop.
1321577910684319751 2020-10-29 06:21:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @frodri_023 @Barnes_Law Stuffing E-Day ballot boxes is completely aside from the current appeal.
1321577596467974145 2020-10-29 06:20:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @frodri_023 @Barnes_Law They stuffed E-Day ballot boxes, which is different than the scheme they're trying now.
1321576938000076801 2020-10-29 06:17:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @frodri_023 The request deadline was yesterday. They can't request more mail in votes now. The number is the number.
1321576275987890177 2020-10-29 06:15:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CastleChrome It will if Republicans don't show up. Show up!
1321576201174077441 2020-10-29 06:14:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacksonPackson1 True, but I think our guys will watch them like a hawk. Also, this is the advantage of waiting until election day: They'll have to guesstimate. Right now, with how abysmal the mail in voting is so far in PA for Dems, I just don't see them able to do it even with some Philly fraud
1321574742856507392 2020-10-29 06:09:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm still not certain why everyone is panicking about PA: Dems didn't even get to half the total vote in requests, let alone returns. And some just won't be returned. Like, it would be suspicious if over 90% we returned, tbh.
1321572063958753285 2020-10-29 05:58:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BayouSzarvas @SelimSeesYou Precisely. 2009 is a bit of an exception, but that was a wave no one could hide. We must pray Trump wins: Maybe these people's crimes can be exposed once and for all.
1321569688296574978 2020-10-29 05:49:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @davidchapman141 I'm actually surprised it's still dropping. There just aren't that many votes coming in from California.
1321569058085625856 2020-10-29 05:46:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Samhydabber12 @SelimSeesYou I don't even understand why anyone is talking about Georgia or Texas. There are so many votes there it doesn't matter at this point.
1321568493452623872 2020-10-29 05:44:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The reason I mention 2006 is it's very typical to see a lot of surprisingly close races in a wave year. One side is more energized to vote, of course they'll come up with a shocker or two. So, it's actually surprising to see a Republican doing better than expected in a D wave.
1321567891683217410 2020-10-29 05:41:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Dems were overestimated even in 2006. Like, Jim Webb was supposed to run away with Virginia by 5 points. It went to a recount.   Same thing happened in 2014 with Ed Gillespie. Both were probably robbed by stuffed ballots.
1321567433644253185 2020-10-29 05:40:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brettbjj_brett That's the problem for Dems: This whole situation is turning out to favor the more motivated voters and that's just us, not them.
1321567225116008448 2020-10-29 05:39:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 If there's a 155 million voters, it's going to be driven by every White White Working Class male in this country registered to vote dragging his ass to the polls on Election Day. That would be amazing.
1321566703025868804 2020-10-29 05:37:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joshualucas This is embarrassing: My calculator apparently multiplied it a second time. 75% nationally would make sense of a 70% CA return rate, though.
1321566089030049794 2020-10-29 05:34:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf It did. We got a burst at the end of last week. Right now it seems to be slowing. Especially the mail returns. We're at about 49 right now. Just running into laws of diminishing returns right now as Ds are now searching for low propensity voters. They're getting some, though.
1321565562888212480 2020-10-29 05:32:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Washington had an 80% return rate last time, Oregon 70%. Like, there's just no pattern here, even in these two states with similar demographic groups and cultures.
1321565209690050562 2020-10-29 05:31:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I feel like this is the mean results. We could always see a dramatic slow down or pickup. The whole states voting by mail really throw a wrench in any analysis as they will likely have different return rates than states where you actually have to make an effort.
1321564597950783489 2020-10-29 05:28:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Nationally there are 91,851,474 total mail vote requests, including the entire states of: CA, OR, WA, NV, UT, and CO.   At 85% return, 66.4 million will have voted by mail. I feel like that's consistent with what we're seeing. Another 35 million in person, 45-50 EDay.
1321563249188491265 2020-10-29 05:23:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brettbjj_brett Might explain the abysmal request rate in PA.
1321560483107885059 2020-10-29 05:12:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @codysviews @lsu_sir @AirBossUT5 Much of my family lives in between Fresno and Sacramento somewhere. Yeah, it's bad. My grandmother has barely been able to leave her house in months because of first covid and now the air quality issue.
1321558970201460738 2020-10-29 05:06:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @codysviews @lsu_sir @AirBossUT5 The air quality isn't that bad when you're on the north or central coast. Air quality is absolutely horrendous in the South Valley, though, because of both the Bay and LA. Definitely worst in the country outside NYC and a couple random industrial bastions here and there.
1321557724510015488 2020-10-29 05:01:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @codysviews @lsu_sir @AirBossUT5 The only thing they should want is the weather.
1321557288394596353 2020-10-29 04:59:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly GOP is talking about potential 90% GOP turnout rates when it's all set and done. They don't even have to win Indies if they hit that crazy number and Dems don't show up on Election Day.
1321556785451454464 2020-10-29 04:57:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @lsu_sir @codysviews @AirBossUT5 I was born in San Jose. I feel sad when I think of what has happened to the Golden State.
1321556243513823243 2020-10-29 04:55:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I'm so confused by the mask thing at this point. It was supposed to be that you protected others by wearing it, but now you protect yourself? This isn't science. If you're going to sell me BS, try to at least keep the story straight. This is like a bad poker bluff.
1321555206266650629 2020-10-29 04:51:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "Rally size doesn't matter."  You should read about the dueling rallies between McCain and Obama in Virginia the day before the election.   There are a lot of aberrations in primaries, maybe there will be because of rona, but they are trying this car rally thing to combat that.
1321554108390776833 2020-10-29 04:47:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @codysviews @AirBossUT5 Michigan might be unique because of their psycho governor. All politics is local, so you could see a slight shift like that.
1321552978197860353 2020-10-29 04:42:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @codysviews @AirBossUT5 It has happened. Most recently 1988.
1321551789733384193 2020-10-29 04:37:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @turdferguson691 These are the same people who think it's a moral duty to stay in Afghanistan until Christ's Second Coming.
1321548230291763210 2020-10-29 04:23:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ryan_Milliron @AirBossUT5 It's fairly normal to get 20% of the electorate to have not voted in the last election. Those people would probably be the most excited to check the box, and thus the most likely to show up at rallies.
1321547075931295744 2020-10-29 04:19:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sburke85 @AirBossUT5 GOP has voter files, so they can definitely cross check it.
1321546395556499456 2020-10-29 04:16:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 Bullhead City has retirees, doesn't it? Might be "did not votes" in AZ, but they might have back home. 25% is more normal.
1321545970186883079 2020-10-29 04:14:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The process of mail in voting is essentially a literacy tests that the Democrats have voluntarily subjected their low propensity voters to.
1321544792917135362 2020-10-29 04:10:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim That's a pretty cool story.
1321542396899938304 2020-10-29 04:00:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Look: Another reason they wanted their leaners to vote early. The closer we get to Election Day, the more all of their narratives just collapse because the truth usually finds a way in our environment.
1321541594147938307 2020-10-29 03:57:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All that the reveal proves today is that there is a permanent administrative state who want to impose their policies regardless of the will of voters. You have an option to reject their plots.
1321539585382535173 2020-10-29 03:49:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidS56943033 @Cogi2_ErgoTsun Trump is putting all the work in. All we need to do is vote. If we show up more than they do, then we win. And these people are afraid in their basements all day.
1321538607258210305 2020-10-29 03:45:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidS56943033 @Cogi2_ErgoTsun Have you heard of the Law of Diminishing Returns? He obviously should focus on PA, but camping out there will only have a marginal effect.
1321536824653893632 2020-10-29 03:38:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cogi2_ErgoTsun @DavidS56943033 He hasn't crunched it yet even. It's raw data. He said he think it's about even in Kenosha, though, and that's traditionally a WI bellwether.
1321535147980869632 2020-10-29 03:31:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump is bouncing everywhere, but definite focus on the Big 4. Obama and Biden rallying together on Saturday night in Michigan. Definitely coming down to the Rust Belt.
1321534377369702405 2020-10-29 03:28:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 Yeah, we're going to be 15 or so early. Polls here in VA open at 6 AM, which is REALLY early.
1321534127443636224 2020-10-29 03:27:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidS56943033 I listened already as I do almost everyday for the past month. I did not get that message.
1321533827022495746 2020-10-29 03:26:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BladesOfChaos70 @GranTorinoDSA This is the Saturday before the election. Traditionally that's in a state you think will be the tipping point.
1321532369413775362 2020-10-29 03:20:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Des Moines Register poll this weekend will probably be insightful. However, their reputation is tarnished from their stunt in the Dem Caucus. Could be an opportunity to redeem it.
1321531567420903425 2020-10-29 03:17:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidS56943033 Your presentation of what Baris said is the disinfo. He didn't say Trump was impossibly behind in MI or WI. It's the same as last time: PA is the real state that wins or loses the election.
1321531110745083904 2020-10-29 03:15:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidS56943033 He's just throwing random stuff out there. It's fun.
1321530789734027264 2020-10-29 03:14:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidS56943033 He didn't say that because Trump is impossibly behind in WI and MI.
1321529331605274631 2020-10-29 03:08:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Constantly finding these numbered account spreading disinfo and doomerism.
1321528902729277440 2020-10-29 03:06:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BladesOfChaos70 @SelimSeesYou @Peoples_Pundit @RobertCahaly One bad outlier cycle and you should cancelled USC/Dornsife too for being as much bad Dem. They're Biden+11.
1321526479054950400 2020-10-29 02:57:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BladesOfChaos70 @SelimSeesYou I just give more weight to right wing guys. Everything is on the line for @Peoples_Pundit and @RobertCahaly. Even Rasmussen will be tarnished bad, possibly expelled from the club. The stakes are much lower for the others.
1321525853822558214 2020-10-29 02:54:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Vaiv71738794 @BladesOfChaos70 @SelimSeesYou Without that single poll, Biden would be down to +3.3 in the Battlegrounds. 3 tenths of a point.
1321525227596226561 2020-10-29 02:52:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Vaiv71738794 @BladesOfChaos70 @SelimSeesYou It's the only reason Biden inched up today in the BG polling. Remove that and Trump would be up again. Statistically, it's perfectly valid to remove an outlier like that. It's usually recommended to come up with a real mean.
1321524986255998977 2020-10-29 02:51:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BladesOfChaos70 @SelimSeesYou Like, I don't know how you can trust these people at all at this point. Like, they're just going to have to show me with hard votes on election night and until then I'm going to discount most of them.
1321524728935440387 2020-10-29 02:50:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BladesOfChaos70 @SelimSeesYou Normally, I'd agree, but we're at the point where we have two different groups of polls in a lot of states. It's not just that one R leaning pollster is out on a limb and another D leaner is out on theirs. Combine that with the concerted smear campaign against R-leaners.
1321522117284925440 2020-10-29 02:40:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis I really don't like being this way, but I just believe they're faking numbers and/or don't care. Just absolutely ridiculous stuff is published every time we get a new round. Trump up in Florida! Collapsing in Wisconsin! All politics is local, but not THAT local.
1321521151424761856 2020-10-29 02:36:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 1 or 2 outliers? Yes, those happen all the time. Usually in both directions. We're at the point where pollsters like Susquehenna, Trafalgar, Rasmussen, and Emerson show a completely different race than the other media polls.
1321520855474704387 2020-10-29 02:34:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We've never seen a polling cycle with a bimodal distribution of polls.
1321520618718793729 2020-10-29 02:34:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Bimodal distribution.
1321518708293095435 2020-10-29 02:26:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume It's amazing how Bush 41's percentage among the GOP in 1992 matched almost exactly his percentage in the primaries. Was within a couple points.
1321514979300904960 2020-10-29 02:11:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Pennsylvania Democrats have been renowned for their disloyalty for decades. Penn Republicans have been insanely loyal.
1321514542501974017 2020-10-29 02:09:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou We have a bimodal polling distribution right now, though. That is very weird. Not sure if it has ever happened.
1321510820187131912 2020-10-29 01:55:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JonJohn28289587 @LuisBobby3 @RedEaglePatriot @hireb @DavidAFoshee @realikamusume @RealAPolitics @shujamtaro I don’t care how TargetSmart tells me to use their data. Of course registered party is more accurate: It’s a hard number. The modeled party is far more interesting in most circumstances because of the large number of GOP leans in the Indie crowd.

1321505943197306881 2020-10-29 01:35:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @nguyenthevote Publishing results like this: You need to show nearly exactly who you polled, because I get the feeling you polled every librarian in Eau Claire for your vote spread in that region.
1321505428954632192 2020-10-29 01:33:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume This is criminal. Like people actually need to go to jail after the election.
1321504515510669313 2020-10-29 01:30:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume They’re really excited about her plan to abolish social security.
1321502421546389507 2020-10-29 01:21:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @billsretpal 80% return rate. Meaning, of the requested ballots, more than 80% will go back. 80% is like the minimum you want.

They expected half the vote to come by mail in PA and that will not happen: There simply aren't enough requests.
1321501966674120706 2020-10-29 01:19:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JonJohn28289587 @RedEaglePatriot @hireb @DavidAFoshee @realikamusume @RealAPolitics @shujamtaro Of course they're not: No one knows who these people voted for. But *every* indicator is that GOP turnout is much higher than expected by polling. Every one. You apparently retweet TLP, so I guess you're delusional and think this is Republicans crawling over glass for Biden.
1321501192309137409 2020-10-29 01:16:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Part of the reason the vote gap is narrowing in Florida is the GOP is narrowing the gap in return rates among mail ins. It was like 5% last week. Down to 2.6%. Looking like Dems will get over 80, though.
1321499908277473281 2020-10-29 01:11:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JonJohn28289587 @LuisBobby3 @RedEaglePatriot @hireb @DavidAFoshee @realikamusume @RealAPolitics @shujamtaro Turnout percentage is more important and it's low in Philly.
1321499357590544385 2020-10-29 01:09:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JonJohn28289587 @RedEaglePatriot @hireb @DavidAFoshee @realikamusume @RealAPolitics @shujamtaro That's a two way street. These were very accurate in the past. The only way it isn't now is if GOP leaners have abandoned Trump en masse and there's no indication of that anywhere, even polling.
1321498068064325634 2020-10-29 01:04:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sprucemoose75 @realikamusume I was growing suspicious by mid-April of their nature, but that cemented it in the public's mind and that's when I'm like "yeah, now I feel absolutely no moral obligation to abide by the order." I take a very strong view of Romans 13 in Scripture, but even I'm like "nope.'
1321497180121845760 2020-10-29 01:00:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @RedEaglePatriot @JonJohn28289587 @hireb @DavidAFoshee @realikamusume @RealAPolitics @shujamtaro That's what it seems like.
1321496983811620864 2020-10-29 01:00:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The ship has sailed. I was very sympathetic to emergency government powers early on, but now that it's clear these are being used merely a political tool for a certain political party to spread fear among the populace, I don't care. All legitimacy is lost in them.
1321496434831691776 2020-10-29 00:57:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @RedEaglePatriot @JonJohn28289587 @hireb @DavidAFoshee @realikamusume @RealAPolitics @shujamtaro It's partially the far left 99% Dem vote that isn't showing up too. The more marginal groups that vote a bit more GOP than the average Black are. That's part of the reason Trump will likely get a higher percentage of Blacks.
1321496172893245445 2020-10-29 00:56:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JonJohn28289587 @RedEaglePatriot @hireb @DavidAFoshee @realikamusume @RealAPolitics @shujamtaro Just because you're an NPA doesn't mean you call yourself that, though. A lot of people call themselves a Republican and they're really a registered NPA. It's just meant to incorporate the "leaners."
1321495408535896065 2020-10-29 00:53:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JonJohn28289587 @RedEaglePatriot @hireb @DavidAFoshee @realikamusume @RealAPolitics @shujamtaro It's not 100% accurate, but we can take all the data together. People who subscribe to Guns &amp; Ammo don't show up to vote for Joe Biden because they're afraid of coronavirus: That's the type of information TargetSmart has.
1321493780986531840 2020-10-29 00:47:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @RedEaglePatriot @JonJohn28289587 @hireb @DavidAFoshee @realikamusume @RealAPolitics @shujamtaro GOP has a lot of random WWC low propensity voters who don't pay attention to the last minute. Dems have their minorities who do similar. It appears the WWC is more excited this year, but all things being equal these "make it easier to vote" measures usually help Dems more.
1321493420083417095 2020-10-29 00:45:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou That's why I want to amend section 230 and not repeal it. Repealing it will just lead to an end of the Internet.   "Like, look, we'll protect you, but you have to let people say whatever you want on your platform as long as it ain't porn, ok?"

It's reasonably to assume Independents break roughly equal to the R:D break overall in their group.
1321492081483882499 2020-10-29 00:40:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Interesting factoid.

1321487238891479041 2020-10-29 00:21:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Political power is literally about being able to use force on people. Of course it invokes deep passion when we’re talking about the kind of philosophical divide in our country now. It’s exactly what you’d expect given historical precedent.
1321486124154605569 2020-10-29 00:16:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @warpfactor13 If it comes down to that, it will get really ugly.
1321484559234568193 2020-10-29 00:10:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume YES. I’ve been saying do Rochester for like two weeks now.
1321484369618415617 2020-10-29 00:10:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If nationally 10% of all mail ins end up being invalid, and Biden wins mail ins 2:1, it would knock about 1.5 million votes off his margin. This is given my assumption the invalidation rate will be extremely low in the Dem strongholds. 20% in FL? Ugly.
1321482648225751046 2020-10-29 00:03:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Maybe Dem voters shouldn't riot?
1321482211166740480 2020-10-29 00:01:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @crs2044 @NoctRomaRTW @realikamusume @Summerterrace1 @SelbJim I mean harder than his 2016 and 2020 runs are, not than Romney.
1321482017247236096 2020-10-29 00:00:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @crs2044 @NoctRomaRTW @realikamusume @Summerterrace1 @SelbJim He still nearly beat Obama. Imagine if Trump ran in 2012? Might have juiced turnout even higher than 2008. Would have been harder for him to carry MI and WI, but I suspect easier to carry VA, NV, and NH.
1321481095788060674 2020-10-28 23:56:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @realikamusume @Summerterrace1 @SelbJim Romney was NOT confident. I went to a Romney Rally the day before the election and he did not look like he was having a good time and he was in a part of Virginia that just doesn't have a lot of votes.
1321478443893248000 2020-10-28 23:46:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I can only identify one election in history where WI voted 10 points left of MI: 1988.
1321478046772305920 2020-10-28 23:44:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 85% of ballots returned. 20% of those without signature. Another 5% destroyed by riots.
1321477397875728389 2020-10-28 23:42:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis @RAHarrisonPA @conservmillen @ScottAdamsSays @brithume @Barnes_Law @dbongino @DonaldJTrumpJr @LarrySchweikart Yes, my understanding is that every Trump supporter is secretly afraid of the rona. I hear that even I myself will cast a vote for Biden because deep down, I know only he can totally stop the spread of respiratory illness.
1321472957944836096 2020-10-28 23:24:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Response rates are horrendous: Pew and Gallup, both historically good surveys, were talking about this since the "no landline" group became too big. It has only gotten worse. These surveys were never true science and now it's even less science than it used to be.
1321471948237557760 2020-10-28 23:20:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Gallup, the gold standard, left the field. Basically it's the wild, wild west out there now.
1321470887518998534 2020-10-28 23:16:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed I just hope polls are permanently discredited after this cycle. They're absolutely horrendous for dialogue and they're only getting worse. If only some GOP partisans can get it close to right, what's even the point?
1321469189937385480 2020-10-28 23:09:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @realikamusume @RealAPolitics Baris doesn't weight by party, though. I do think the electorate will be slightly more GOP than he expects in PA, for sure, though.
1321467317612613633 2020-10-28 23:02:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Popular vote in site.

1321465762549276673 2020-10-28 22:56:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK It's more like intimidation. Not a lot of "persuasion" has gone on.

1321460574384017409 2020-10-28 22:35:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @yemanouspeak I learned this in a basic stats class in college. Part of reason I've been skeptical of polling for a long time. It only seems to be getting worse and now with one side disproportionately doing it, who knows how it will affect the data. For all we know, Trump is 10 points ahead.
1321457479985803264 2020-10-28 22:23:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 "Everyone is afraid of catching the rona and dying!"
1321456783475560449 2020-10-28 22:20:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump supporters yelling "F U pollster, I'm voting Trump." *Hangs up*  Pollster: "I guess they're not voting."
1321454852266930177 2020-10-28 22:12:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> For reference, there were 6,165,478 votes in Pennsylvania last time.
1321454133161971714 2020-10-28 22:09:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> PA has a total of 3,058,418 ballot requests out.  1,926,783Democrats 775,084 Republicans 25,047 Minor Parties 331,504 NPAs.  That's about half the vote last time. They'll need to return nearly all of them to the half of the vote in they wanted. If it's like 85%, it's 2.6 mil.
1321451005435875332 2020-10-28 21:57:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The fact is, Dems need a large amount of defection among traditional Republican voters at this point. Either that or they need to run up the score with true Indies.
1321450036098703360 2020-10-28 21:53:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon Probably. Also to skew the battleground average, which is getting mighty close.
1321449869589045251 2020-10-28 21:52:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We've been doing significant early voting since 2004, especially in Florida, and the Republicans have won the Florida Election Day vote in EVERY election in Florida. Including 2008. And you're telling me an election where Ds are afraid to leave their house will be different?
1321449322748301315 2020-10-28 21:50:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 Who just don't seem to be voting in any significant numbers.
1321448790298120196 2020-10-28 21:48:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MaridiaNorfair @realikamusume California and Nevada are having similar problems.
1321448190122598402 2020-10-28 21:46:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These polls have over 90% GOP loyalty to Trump in both states. That is utterly bizarre for there to be that kind of landslide among solely Indies.
1321445111339823109 2020-10-28 21:34:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The WaPo release a 17 point race in WI, but only a 7 point race in Michigan. What?   I think people are just trolling at this point.
1321439621272772608 2020-10-28 21:12:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LibertyLover70 @SwampFox8 That’s because of casino culinary union workers. Nowhere near as many of those.
1321325795546193921 2020-10-28 13:39:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner That’s how I read this. These people have to know the early vote numbers in Florida. Like, I’m assuming this gets leaked to campaigns somehow.
1321324223839772672 2020-10-28 13:33:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing The Trump airport plane rally is the new Whistlestop tour. Other campaigns have done it, but with nowhere the effect and speed Trump does.
1321323490058870785 2020-10-28 13:30:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp GOP guy: “Yo, hey, these people want to destroy our way of life, mind voting to help maybe stop it?”   Oil worker: “Sure, Biden seems awful and I kind of like Trump.”
1321322741698613248 2020-10-28 13:27:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing It’s legit just campaigning. Dragging more people to vote in your strongholds is far more effective than trying to convince some random swing voter to switch sides. That’s the desperation move: Scrounging up every random swing voter you can.
1321321956130652164 2020-10-28 13:24:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All the lefties are acting like this is desperation. Shocking the GOP would go ask the neighbors they know would vote GOP to actually do it in larger margins.
1321320920179527680 2020-10-28 13:20:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KhakiBlueSocks @AP @KevDGrussing Do you understand how margins work? It’s not like an extra vote there counts less than one in Philadelphia or Bucks County?
1321318862823002117 2020-10-28 13:12:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly Yahoo is big. Lot of random middle aged swing voters who read that site.
1321314930084220928 2020-10-28 12:56:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan I mean, there was a reason this used to be reversed in Florida and GOP slightly favored mail in while Dems slightly favored in person.
1321311488980766721 2020-10-28 12:43:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @W4nk_3ngine @SelimSeesYou “Our polls weren’t that far off in the end! How dare you even question us!”
1321309669424537600 2020-10-28 12:35:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan The problem Dems have had for a long time with understanding how right leaning the country is that the overwhelming majority of them live in these lefty bughives where any right wing opinion is banned, yet a quarter of them defect and vote Right anyway. That’s the shy Trump guy.
1321300954231250944 2020-10-28 12:01:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 It’s going to be so hilarious when the Miami early vote dumps and it’s like 40% for Trump without even the Election Day voters tallied.
1321298547900354563 2020-10-28 11:51:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat On that level, yes. It’s just so...empty. Feels even more empty than Obama to me and I never thought much of the substance of Obama’s campaign speeches.
1321292050915053573 2020-10-28 11:25:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Anton56422519 @_dirigiste Thank you
1321291073134755840 2020-10-28 11:21:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Even going back to 2006 (undeniably a Dem year), a lot of these Senate races that the final round of polling had as strongly leaning Dem ended up being extremely close. Particularly VA, MT, and MO.
1321290711661162498 2020-10-28 11:20:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Historically speaking, if you're going to be on someone to beat their polling spread in the past decade and a half at least, you should bet on the Republican. You'd have made way more money outside of Sharon Angle in NV 2010 and the strength of Obama's national win in 12.
1321283425756762114 2020-10-28 10:51:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "We choose hope over fear." Really rich coming from the party of covid panic porn.
1321281381700378625 2020-10-28 10:43:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon A "surge" would be about 20%. This might look like 15% in the voter file, though.
1321280650717089794 2020-10-28 10:40:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm too lazy to do my daily early vote update. Youth vote inched up to....10.3% nationally. Exciting stuff for Dems.
1321280190333464576 2020-10-28 10:38:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ClassicalTheis Nate's model, even if it weren't so skewed by fake polls he gives A ratings and his banishment of polls with good track records, is ridiculously full of completely impossible noise and it's probably worse when you have the kind of crazy polling cycle we've seen.
1321279239438651392 2020-10-28 10:34:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 Like I said earlier: The only x-factor in this election is the rona and the Dem propaganda around it. If there wasn't this constant panic porn and "Trump is to blame" propaganda, this wouldn't even be a race. Taints the legitimacy of this whole process.
1321278143894900736 2020-10-28 10:30:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK How much you want to bet those no parties are people who don't want to tell the poll worker they're voting Trump? Way higher percentage of those in Clark and Washoe than the rest of the state, where you might get some weirdo embarrassed they're a Dem sheep in Elko.
1321275963762745345 2020-10-28 10:21:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou They're just desperate to peddle rona as the top issue because about all they have is stirring people into fear of the rona.
1321274819334340609 2020-10-28 10:17:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This a totally expected in a Biden+8 national election. People totally register as Republicans to vote for Joe Biden.
1321274278067798016 2020-10-28 10:15:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 LOL at the idea PA isn't the Dems' Florida. If Trump manages to win PA, how does he lose Florida? That made sense in 2016 when Hispanics hated him and we knew about the potential WWC voter, but not now.
1321273323842621441 2020-10-28 10:11:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp LOL. That's basically their idea of patriotism.
1321272516233625600 2020-10-28 10:08:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp That's the type of crazy pseudo-patriotism these Conservative, Inc. people used to promote "Look at all these people who want to be Americans! They're just like you! They want to wear cowboy hats and own a gun or two (for hunting purposes only, of course)!"
1321271262853898242 2020-10-28 10:03:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Don't put it past them to claim Trump is involved in some kind of scheme with China at the last minute.
1321270852411887620 2020-10-28 10:01:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I don't think a Republican could ever get elected in this country on an explicitly pro-immigration position, at least not historically. In the future, it would only happen after severe mismanagement by the Democrats.
1321270658949668864 2020-10-28 10:00:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp While it is true the Labor Left has always been anti-migration, this was something they used to get along with the right on. In the US at least, the key shift was the Kennedy/Johnson Dems going neolib, most especially with the 1965 Bill.
1321268376472342529 2020-10-28 09:51:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @italiantrumper1 @realikamusume PredictIt is thrown off by people who legit believe 538 is some kind of scientific oddsmakers.
1321268167822528513 2020-10-28 09:50:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp It's a high stakes game we're playing right now, but the entire reason the system worked the way it did for them is that center-left parties helped the working class backbone enough they didn't rebel. That has changed.
1321265801953972224 2020-10-28 09:41:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jhc131 I have not seen it.
1321265524945395720 2020-10-28 09:40:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Final note on it: I suspect why we almost perennially see late surges from these types of movements is precisely the people pollsters miss convincing people in the group pollsters reach to vote the way they do.
1321264910551158788 2020-10-28 09:37:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Part of reason these people are almost perennially missed is because they're not convenient people for the establishment. They don't want them to be there. So their own confirmation bias tells them not to reach them because they don't think they really exist or at least vote.
1321264392672026625 2020-10-28 09:35:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Unless you're incredibly dedicated to reaching these people like @Peoples_Pundit and @RobertCahaly are, you're just going to miss this group of people with these types of ideas.
1321263938026250242 2020-10-28 09:34:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The thing about all of these races: The reasons the vote broke the way it did is basically the same as the issues Trump represents. The key Tory vote in 2015 in the UK was a proxy vote for a Brexit Referendum, and thus Brexit itself, forecasting that error. It's the same problem
1321262341669982211 2020-10-28 09:27:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I know you're all shocked. No way only reaching 35 screeching feminists was unrepresentative of working class Philly suburbs.
1321259251721973760 2020-10-28 09:15:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AkwesiQuan_ @realikamusume Trump gets 30% because only the Italian working class wards show up.
1321259145463582720 2020-10-28 09:15:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume There have to be Dem ballots getting destroyed in these riots.
1321258673944088577 2020-10-28 09:13:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy I don't know, it's like we're experiencing two different elections. Goes with the theme of the whole year. These people still live in a fantasy land where there's mass covid death and conservatives are deliberately spreading illness in NYC.
1321258255272808451 2020-10-28 09:11:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf I'll be honest, I was getting a bit worried at the end of last week with how fast it was occurring. However, now that it has returned to form, still doesn't look like they'll get enough. Not sure how to parse out requests. Right now I'd guess a total of 70 million mail votes max.
1321256942736650242 2020-10-28 09:06:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Mail vote returns are slowing to a trickle.
1321255439414317056 2020-10-28 09:00:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Bill Nelson is a great Democratic Majority Senator.
1321254210055393281 2020-10-28 08:55:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Like, that was in the golden era of polling the case. Now that they’re probably just garbage, it’s might be a whole other animal.
1321254063984545793 2020-10-28 08:54:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I was trying to tell people it takes like two or three days for polls to actually pick up movement in the electorate. People just don’t like telling you they changed their mind yesterday. It’s why I put no stock in the “when did you decide?” exit poll number.
1321253302303133697 2020-10-28 08:51:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Just that oil comment might have shifted some normally partisan Democrats in places like New Mexico into, at the very least, not voting.
1321252813909991425 2020-10-28 08:49:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> People voting in early October are mostly partisans anyway, so it hasn’t had as much of an effect as Dems hoped, but there are some confused souls who get influenced by family members.
1321252372467929089 2020-10-28 08:48:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Early voting was ALWAYS about this. Campaign twists and turns always have the most effect when deployed late, regardless of their nature. Nearly all of these in recent history benefit the Republican in the race. Part of the reason the GOP always wins Election Day voting.
1321251169742848000 2020-10-28 08:43:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou A lot of those seats were in blue states, though. 14 between California, New York, and New Jersey alone. 3 in Virginia. In relevant swing states, there was like 4 net gains, including the ones in PA which were judicial activist gerrymandering.
1321249704437493762 2020-10-28 08:37:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume These people probably know the vote counts under the table.
1321249260889923589 2020-10-28 08:35:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ShadowOfOcelot @JayFiveK This is in Montgomery County, which voted for Clinton by 21 points. It is right on the line for Bucks County where it was a two point race, though.
1321248338885419011 2020-10-28 08:32:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CommonM24045307 @juukuchi @realikamusume “Fine, honey, I’ll vote for Trump so you can make more money.”
1321245209137655810 2020-10-28 08:19:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @AkwesiQuan_ @realikamusume That’s one reason I’m hoping for a big break. Kind of hard to deny a 330 EV landslide as just some laptop.
1321243794038231043 2020-10-28 08:14:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Looks like a little bit of a reversal of 2018.
1321240531582812162 2020-10-28 08:01:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> *might
1321240309251133440 2020-10-28 08:00:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Electoral College is amazing with checking forced national narratives. For instance, Covid: Trump wins narrowly if he wins FL, NC, GA, NH, AZ, and NV: Why most those states buck a national trend? NV's economy has been ruined by D fearmongering and NH is Live Free or Die.
1321238852682633218 2020-10-28 07:54:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LVB_19 @SelimSeesYou He seems to really know how to tap into groups other people miss. No one else thinks in these terms because they've been brainwashed by leftist ideology not to: No one thinks about how Italians in Bucks County might vote differently than similar (on the surface) German people.
1321238453661634563 2020-10-28 07:52:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WMiddleton1837 @tonybalogna @SelimSeesYou Especially with the way they've threatened his entire family and livelihood. I don't know, I'd like to think I have a good poker face, but I wouldn't be too enthusiastic if I thought I was about to be ruined after a life of being a workaholic.
1321237209391968257 2020-10-28 07:47:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LVB_19 @SelimSeesYou Did he ever give a reason? Or did he just label it a fake poll?

1321233502860357634 2020-10-28 07:33:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan "Let's totally ignore our centuries of theory on the nature of the democratic administrative state."
1321232025827872768 2020-10-28 07:27:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I also don't think anyone is really thinking about how Covid moves might affect this race. We might see way more surprises given the fact there does appear to be a significant number of Covid migrants. Where will these people vote? Who will they vote for? Will they vote?
1321230955923836929 2020-10-28 07:23:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Took a little look at it: Trump back in the lead among seniors. 2 points underwater with Indies. Getting 95% of Republicans. Deficit comes from "the suburbs."  I just think we're very liable to underestimate Trump's raw vote margin in the rurals and overestimate suburban shift.
1321229283243790336 2020-10-28 07:16:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These people send out literal clowns to give covid updates, but Trump is the bad guy for making light of it. 🤡 Literally
1321227565005156352 2020-10-28 07:09:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy @SelimSeesYou It was never Biden+12 in PA. Just never. There's definitely Trumpmentum post-debate, but the margins were never that wide. Same thing in 16: There were ridiculous polls it was tied in places like MO or IN over the summer. Those were 20 point races: Give me a break.
1321226928649633792 2020-10-28 07:07:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Watch Quinn drop some crazy "Trump +15" in Texas polls so their "bias" is artificially skewed in the 538.
1321226760730673152 2020-10-28 07:06:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Foot Locker is the smart choice, but I kind of like some of knick-knacks you find floating around Ollie's, but I'd never spend a nick on.
1321225677862031360 2020-10-28 07:02:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou He claims he removed the national polls because they affected his "model" too much, but the only thing he seems to care about are the national polls and leaked district internals. Ignoring that the polls in the swing states are basically right where they were 4 years ago.
1321222489163337735 2020-10-28 06:49:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Biden losing points by the minute in Texas and Ohio.  Also, Bloomberg just believes memes. Bloomberg lives in an echo chamber where all his "closest" Republican friends hate Donald Trump.
1321221054933667844 2020-10-28 06:43:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CJlegalBeagle @SelimSeesYou I need to watch "Plot Against the President" tonight.
1321219741902639106 2020-10-28 06:38:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Yeah, Catholics only blend into the whole thing when they're basically Americanist heretics in terms of RCism.
1321217609707196417 2020-10-28 06:29:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @Lewis30730015 We have Democratic Governors who have been trying to use the emergency powers of their office to spread panic among their populations so they vote Democrat. If that isn't Banana Republic level stuff, I don't know what is.
1321217319226511360 2020-10-28 06:28:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @Lewis30730015 I don't really like being one of those people who promises to leave after every election or something, but the issues at stake in this election are big and there's no doubt about that. "It's always the most important election!" Well, yeah, until it is actually.
1321216735870095364 2020-10-28 06:26:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW I'm not doubting that Trump is likely to pull this off at this point. I'm just saying there's no way we can spin a Trump loss and if I can influence one person to get out to the ballot box who would otherwise stay home as some kind of protest, every little bit help.
1321216251528679431 2020-10-28 06:24:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 1500 followers, thank you!  https://t.co/KUGD4jxhLM
1321215451658100737 2020-10-28 06:21:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp That's the problem: Basically every right-wing (and, perhaps, left-wing) dissident group should be all in on Trump because to do otherwise is to validate the strategy that will be used against you: Non-stop media barrage and smear campaigns until "decent" people reject you.
1321214821308747778 2020-10-28 06:18:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These guys trying to spin a Trump loss into something "good" are so weird. I'm not saying it's *impossible* to ever recover, but they will have their whole strat validated. Who cares if White men reject matriarchy if they are incapable of exercising political power?
1321213758937718786 2020-10-28 06:14:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Biden supporters are hiding in their basements because of Covid. Which I guess means everyone you see who leaves their house is a Trump supporter.
1321211676759379969 2020-10-28 06:06:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I like how the Dems mobilize the NatGuard the next day since they know it would be an election killer to go like "we should let the riots continue!"
1321207660553867272 2020-10-28 05:50:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 Selling the "it's ogre" narrative has been like half of their campaign argument.
1321206524472107009 2020-10-28 05:45:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> For reference, nowhere I've lived since I can vote has party registration and they have very different profiles.

1321206167050342403 2020-10-28 05:44:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'd trust TargetSmart data less if I wasn't able to open up counties I've lived in and go like "yeap, that's about what I'd expect."

1321201445992103936 2020-10-28 05:25:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bandofthecock @SelimSeesYou It normally would. We've never had an election like this, though. Only late 19th Century elections were this corrupt.
1321200438318911489 2020-10-28 05:21:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou To be fair, Biden has basically every organ of power in the Western World on his side.
1321199971488718849 2020-10-28 05:19:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I assumed this guy was talking about Trump. Sorry, it was Biden it appears.
1321199796263276548 2020-10-28 05:19:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Uh...he was in NH two days ago? What is this idiot talking about? Ads are a waste of money in NH because of Boston and their independent mindset.
1321198585808097281 2020-10-28 05:14:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's crazy to me that with a week left to go, there are still more votes in Texas than California. I figured Cali would catch up right now. I don't expect the early vote to get anymore Republican (and may tick back a little Democrat) partially because Cali will trickle in.
1321197424623407106 2020-10-28 05:09:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Sk9077809128 I mean, you got the same thing among wignats and immigration. "Well, he should have paid more attention to White voter issues!" It's just not a narrative you can sell unless you have mass media outlets on your side and these guys don't.
1321196737109831680 2020-10-28 05:07:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou This is one reason I'd be concerned if I went to bed with a less than 2 point Florida win. That would mean that some Midwest types probably shifted ever so slightly against Trump considering Trump's improvement with Hispanic voters.
1321195217479999492 2020-10-28 05:01:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The two groups disappointed in Trump are the immigration hardline voters and the hardcore lolbert-leaning 2A crowd. Lots of lolbert sympathies in that crowd. They think their Jo Jorgenson protest vote will get people to pay attention.
1321194099878301698 2020-10-28 04:56:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If Trump loses narrowly, it's because ATF bureaucrats right now are attempting to discourage gun voters by issuing absurd regulations that the admin doesn't have time at the moment to fully check. Make no mistake, if you vote Biden, you're only hurting your 2A rights.
1321192308927352835 2020-10-28 04:49:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Daines is safe. You can go home now.

1321191258484854784 2020-10-28 04:45:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The entire Biden lead was built on the premises:  Suburbs rushing towards Democrats. Early voters rushing towards Democrats.  What if the suburbs are full of shy Trumpists and we all know what the Early Vote looks like right now?
1321190576491028480 2020-10-28 04:42:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @kyubi_chibi @SelimSeesYou They definitely believe they can get Minnesota and they were saving their final push for the end so Dems can't really respond. There are fundamentals that may deliver Trump MN even on an otherwise good night for Biden. St. Louis County flipping is a big deal there.
1321189754189320194 2020-10-28 04:39:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Trump pulls money out of Florida to spend it in Minnesota: "Deperate last minute reach!"  Biden attracts 15 reporters to a GA event: "Bidenmentum! Landslide incoming!"
1321187334918983683 2020-10-28 04:29:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I honestly just don't know how we get an honest election in the near future if Biden wins. Barring some big upset where the Senate stays Republican or something, they will just use this as carte blanche to suppress the slightest hints of Trumpism.
1321186049457033218 2020-10-28 04:24:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If this thing turns into a Biden landslide, definitely deleting my account. Will be desperately trying to find a job in foreign locales.

1321171835057307649 2020-10-28 03:28:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law As you point out, Florida is disproportionately full of retirees and movers from these places and they basically are the marginal voters that decide Florida's elections.
1321171101792247815 2020-10-28 03:25:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks One reason I hope one of the "impossible" states randomly flips. Obviously not CA or NY or something, but VA, CO, or NM, outside OR will suffice.
1321170354375696386 2020-10-28 03:22:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks Then they make fun of Republicans for trying to meme even a light blue state into their camp.
1321169666203701253 2020-10-28 03:19:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks Democrat stronghold turnout: Down. Republican stronghold turnout: Up! Meme: The Republicans are voting for Joe Biden, the True Conservative (tm).
1321168892040019970 2020-10-28 03:16:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AG123321GA @Barnes_Law I guess someone hasn't kept up on employment reports.
1321167691026206724 2020-10-28 03:11:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @whack_a_commie @Barnes_Law That's basically it. It's very hard to find good news for Democrats in the early vote. Most you can find is that they're still in the race in some places.
1321165779623137282 2020-10-28 03:04:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @whack_a_commie @Barnes_Law Seriously, at this point, I think Trump has already had enough votes cast for him in TX it's more than over. And he still has Election Day voters that will come out.
1321161804559634432 2020-10-28 02:48:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Summerterrace1 @Barnes_Law I'm just saying people who vote by mail already don't believe the President on one issue, so it's likelier they lean more towards Biden than the average of their group. Of course, overall, I think this will cancel itself out.
1321160649544769543 2020-10-28 02:43:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 @Fuckgsw2 @SelimSeesYou @Jroxer99 GOP has won Election Day voters basically since Early Vote was a thing in 2004. It's a pretty safe gamble you'll continue winning when you've won that even in a bad year.
1321159628709834752 2020-10-28 02:39:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 @Fuckgsw2 @SelimSeesYou @Jroxer99 I would not trust my ballot to the postal workers in PA or to local elections officials in many of these counties, especially the ancestral Dem counties, unless I absolutely had to.
1321159460723871747 2020-10-28 02:38:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 @Fuckgsw2 @SelimSeesYou @Jroxer99 PA is a unique animal and there is no reason they can't vote on Election Day: If there are there by the time the polls close, they have to let them vote.
1321158653894950916 2020-10-28 02:35:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law Right now, they'd need crazy crossover votes. Even if the polling split was correct, it wouldn't be enough in the votes so far.   I can believe the GOP votes by mail have a slightly higher rate of defection than the in person votes, though.
1321157910383177729 2020-10-28 02:32:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @rightwing_ls @SelimSeesYou PA has had a few polls, but RCP is still including two week old Biden+8 and Biden+10 polls.
1321156772338552832 2020-10-28 02:28:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @Jroxer99 The enthusiasm for Biden is amazing!  Also: Only a miniscule percentage of our people are even bothering to ask for a ballot.
1321156595527593986 2020-10-28 02:27:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The polls expected about half the votes in by election day through mail in PA. Right now, unless there's abysmal turnout, 100% of everyone just about would have to return their mail in ballot.
1321155380236427267 2020-10-28 02:22:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Only another 20K Dem requests in PA today. They got another 2 and a half hours.  @realikamusume @SelimSeesYou @RedEaglePatriot
1321154188643020800 2020-10-28 02:17:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cg9oyg4 Corona, polling, intense media barrages 24/7/365 against candidates they can't ignore. They'll just ignore any future Trumps in the GOP primary, preferring to promote Nikki Haley. Trumps will have to rely on retail politicking in Iowa and New Hampshire to even have a shot.
1321150233720590344 2020-10-28 02:02:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly @realikamusume NH doesn't follow any patterns, really. There's some voters there that follow national trends, but there's just a lot more independent minded people in that state. Same with NM and CO, but to a lesser extent.
1321149321291718657 2020-10-28 01:58:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m fairly certain even McCain won the Election Day vote in Florida. Election Day voters have swung GOP for a long time in that state. Now with a national (and state level) partisan gap of this proportion? I just don’t how you can’t be confident in Florida at this point.
1321147910889852930 2020-10-28 01:53:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @mauritaniadan I was informed Ohioans wanted to stay in their basement until 2025 because Rona.
1321147144359845888 2020-10-28 01:49:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @0xB22234 @Theo_Chilton That’s a good point.
1321146697813270528 2020-10-28 01:48:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Their internals leaked (or what we all assume are their internals). They don’t appear to have been weighted, but it showed Trump with 27% among Blacks, so Silver took them off the aggregate.
1321145959682887684 2020-10-28 01:45:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @0xB22234 @Theo_Chilton I don’t see a reason why a ski resort is fundamentally different in employment dynamics from a beach or spa resort, though. I suspect ski resorts would resort more to Euros than Hispanics, though.
1321143966100819968 2020-10-28 01:37:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Lmao.
1321143874019086336 2020-10-28 01:36:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads State level polls from somewhat reputable pollsters are showing a completely different universe at this point: Corona going down as an issue, economy up, Trumpmentum. Meanwhile IBD has Biden’s edge gaining nationally? Just utterly bizarre.
1321141097775714305 2020-10-28 01:25:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 I don’t know how people don’t believe those guys are just faking numbers at this point. Yet the slimer has the gall to remove Trafalgar from some leaked data sheets.
1321139678762860546 2020-10-28 01:20:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Watch a Q poll drop "Biden plus eleventy thousand!"
1321139575264260097 2020-10-28 01:19:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump officially ahead in the Florida average. Tell me again how this election is decided already.
1321138159451885570 2020-10-28 01:14:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MarcSpector12 @realikamusume As a California transplant myself, there are two groups of California transplant: People who moved because life sucked there and people who moved because some company moved them. The latter group leans left and former group heavy right. Overall, ex-Calis are GOP.
1321137872347516933 2020-10-28 01:13:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SouthernConsDem Yeah, but who cares if Charlie Baker or some Dem is Governor of Massachusetts.
1321136167358730242 2020-10-28 01:06:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MarcSpector12 @realikamusume They key for a Republican between 1988 and 2010 in California was to at least run even in LA. If they did that, there were enough GOP votes in the SoCal suburbs and lopsided margins in the Central Valley to win the state. Now there's just so many fewer GOP voters.
1321134881615859714 2020-10-28 01:01:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @NoctRomaRTW If Trump gets close in VA or wins it, it will be from the same people who delivered him the rust belt and the rest of the South. It's not on the back of the checkpants Republicans in Loudoun County.
1321134699318829059 2020-10-28 01:00:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical Eh, some of it is just they are processing the models. However, yesterday them not doing a second update at night was really suspicious given how far behind they were.
1321133816539451400 2020-10-28 00:57:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @realikamusume No.
1321133282730397697 2020-10-28 00:54:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KarnatakaYankee Not sure I count single women as a group with agency.
1321133131009851402 2020-10-28 00:54:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @VeriteJacques Well, it was also the Republicans who were padding the ballot back then.
1321132582826840066 2020-10-28 00:52:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed I mean, a Democratic Congressional Candidate tried to get 30K ballots counted in his district from people who don't even live there. Democratic Governors are trying to get people afraid of leaving their homes. These aren't legitimate government functions at this point.
1321131948916592640 2020-10-28 00:49:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed You know that's not my point. I certainly didn't think the same thing because Obama prevailed over Romney. This isn't a few extra gotchas thrown at one candidate. We're talking about a systemic plot to undermine the legitimacy of Trump from the start.
1321130387519799296 2020-10-28 00:43:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KarnatakaYankee That's a whole other point: People with any remote level of agency break for Trump by well more than double digits. The only groups of people breaking Biden are the incredibly ill-informed and their loyal minority groups (which even they are faltering to some extent).
1321129515389722625 2020-10-28 00:39:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed It means that the institutions of the American Republic have failed and do not retain the moral authority to bind your conscious the way they normally would. All laws of morality would continue to apply, of course.
1321128142443061248 2020-10-28 00:34:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @user10000000007 California's profile has totally changed even over the last 20 years. Even in 04, Bush only lost by 10 points.
1321127892185743368 2020-10-28 00:33:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Reagan won Marin County in 1980. Maybe even 84. That place is like 90-10 Dem these days.
1321127723469803525 2020-10-28 00:32:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The only reason this is even a race right now is because of crazy levels of fear mongering over Rona. If the rona had been allowed to take it's natural course, we'd be looking at Trump landslides in all the key states due to the flourishing economy.
1321127439054098432 2020-10-28 00:31:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Here's my honest view: *If* Biden wins in a week because more voters actually voted for him in the swing states, it's still illegitimate because the entire reason it happened was a media conspiracy to systematically suppress pro-Trump and anti-Biden narratives. (1/2)
1321126726991314946 2020-10-28 00:28:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Herbert Hoover won Philadelphia in 1932. Kind of weird to think about it.

1321121553686384640 2020-10-28 00:08:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Surprised they don't have SC lean blue.
1321119275713810433 2020-10-27 23:59:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis The funny thing is that most of those things not even THEY wanted in 2016. Some real bad actors got involved, though, especially after their ill-advised C-Ville stunt (a plot that was obviously spooky to start) and now they're these weirdo Nazbols when they used to like Pinochet.
1321118084858597377 2020-10-27 23:54:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Even being very generous to the Dems and assuming a 60:40 split right now, with half the votes still left to go, there's nowhere near enough swing votes in the bank for them to have this thing locked up the way they wanted.
1321117674970165248 2020-10-27 23:52:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Just a reminder that, in order for Biden to be ahead by the 2:1 nationally the polls expected, not a single modeled independent or Democrat voter could have voted for him and about a fifth of the modeled Republicans had to vote for Biden.
1321117182718316545 2020-10-27 23:50:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> He's 10 points ahead guys. Texas is voting Biden because they've had enough of the Bad Orange Man and they want to spend the next two years living in their basement.
1321116855730393092 2020-10-27 23:49:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 Election Day.
1321115952243757061 2020-10-27 23:46:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChancelThreader Suddenly, the media they all abhor is trustworthy because Trump wasn't able to literally get Mexico to sign a big game show wall check while he declares a total moratorium on immigration and ships illegals home by the train load.
1321115565642178560 2020-10-27 23:44:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The thing that has really gotten me about what the Alt-Right has become is that they basically just buy every half-assed media narrative on Trump because they're disappointed there isn't a solid cement barrier on the border and a total immigration moratorium.
1321113914420154373 2020-10-27 23:37:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Wignats still think WWC voters aren't going to show up to the polls because Trump hasn't said the n-word.
1321106529072893952 2020-10-27 23:08:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CatholicEcon You have to stop yourself from wanting it!
1321093398632239106 2020-10-27 22:16:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Well, the economy was 37% and Rona was down at 23%. Honestly I don't think it's even mostly about the issue. I think it's more of a proxy for party affiliation at that point.
1321091477141946372 2020-10-27 22:08:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Yeah, it's not like Philly has 50% of the vote or something like NYC in NY.
1321091235872940035 2020-10-27 22:07:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> FAU poll: "Those who said the Economy is most important are breaking for Trump 80% to 16% while those who said Coronavirus are breaking for Biden 82% to 14%."  Has anyone seen these kind of crazy numbers?
1321088744989097986 2020-10-27 21:57:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I can't believe these lefties still think PA is safe blue after Biden's fracking comment. They're really expecting crazy margins out of the Philly suburbs.

1320972911923126272 2020-10-27 14:17:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I should be asleep, but I wonder how many Dem ballots have been torched in random mailboxes tonight in Philly.
1320970618792222722 2020-10-27 14:08:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tokar @CottoGottfried I think Cotto is overestimating the fraud there. Like, the Strip Employees  aren’t showing up for Biden and more lockdowns. They’re just not. They haven’t shown up yet and they’re not on Election Day.

1320929264217296896 2020-10-27 11:24:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Besides NC, which is more split, the models show these people are generally older and Republican. Does anyone believe people who have voted for every Republican since Jimmy Carter are crawling to the polls to cast a vote for Joe Biden because mean Tweets?

1320921028680441856 2020-10-27 10:51:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> You can probably reasonably guesstimate Biden's strength in a county by combining ballot request percentage and return percentage in PA.

Every one assume they're going to get bigger margins out of Chester, Montgomery, and Bucks, but are we really sure about that? At this point I wouldn't bet on it if I were Dems.
1320911024208420869 2020-10-27 10:11:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 This dude in my replies was trying to claim North Dakota had the highest per capita deaths in the, get this, WORLD because of Sturgis. Never mind Sturgis is in South Dakota and North Dakota is 21st among the states (behind most of the blue ones) in deaths per capita.
1320908542883336193 2020-10-27 10:01:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Having an enemy like old Teddy Kennedy proves that.
1320907047601426432 2020-10-27 09:55:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Every ethnic group with any kind of solid identity in this country is voting Trump. Only the bughives are against him.
1320906269839020033 2020-10-27 09:52:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ComradeDoyIe It's cute when girls make silly mistakes about dude stuff. Shows they care, but they're a girl.
1320904538702913542 2020-10-27 09:45:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WOW0W0 @SelimSeesYou Trump has radically reshaped the courts thanks to @SenatorReid's use of the nuclear option. Best thing that has ever happened to the Republican Party, thank you Senator Reid from the bottom of my heart.
1320904141405913088 2020-10-27 09:44:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @AwkwardGrip Republicans suppressed million of Black votes! Here's an anecdote from someone who couldn't even tell the poll worker what their name was!
1320903782272770049 2020-10-27 09:42:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There hasn't been a night I haven't had a good time dealing with campaign stuff in a couple weeks at least. Maybe the entire month of October.
1320902336886280192 2020-10-27 09:37:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Truth_Reaction @thehangingchads He didn't. Fifth vote on that was Kennedy.
1320901955485663238 2020-10-27 09:35:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Truth_Reaction @thehangingchads Roberts was the swing vote on the court, so now he doesn't get to be the decider on all those 5-4 cases.
1320901421525598208 2020-10-27 09:33:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CelticRoman8 They really wanted more votes banked before the inevitable Trumpmentum of the final week.
1320900993702350848 2020-10-27 09:31:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "So many people have already voted!"  "Well, maybe, but what about all those people in PA who haven't returned their ballots yet?
1320900252120031233 2020-10-27 09:28:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou If Trump wins in a week, it will prove they’re the boy who cried wolf.
1320899726007586818 2020-10-27 09:26:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly It’s up to him. He has earned it and he isn’t that ancient.

1320898165260931072 2020-10-27 09:20:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Probably couldn’t get a date even if this leftist bug hive.
1320897838784651270 2020-10-27 09:19:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> My highly scientific “open up Tinder for the first time in months” yields significantly less BLM and anti-Trump sentiment over the first 50 samples (precisely one tagged BLM and that’s it).
1320896035070291968 2020-10-27 09:12:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Has the Barrett family even gotten their new digs yet?
1320895514645245956 2020-10-27 09:10:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 This would be a cruise with the Rona and Americans deep down know this will be over and they want it to be over. In their stomachs they see Biden wanting the horror to continue for cynical political reasons.
1320895089485488129 2020-10-27 09:08:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It’s on! ACB is going to be fully a Justice in moments!
1320894844030636033 2020-10-27 09:07:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 It’s what I’ve seen from some Twitter folks and it’s really the only rational case they have.
1320893790182379521 2020-10-27 09:03:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> At this point, Democrat coping is down to "Republicans are running to the polls so they can vote for Joe Biden and get more lockdowns because they're afraid of coronavirus."
1320893432915730433 2020-10-27 09:01:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Lots of "here's how Biden can still win!" vibes from Tom Bonier.
1320892990609592326 2020-10-27 09:00:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sgaspari What isn't? More Republicans than expected, fewer Democrats. Fewer youths, minorities (except some pro-Trump Latinos). It's just bad.
1320892677190279168 2020-10-27 08:58:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu It's fun watching the national Democrat lead tick down by half a point every update.
1320892479785324544 2020-10-27 08:58:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu They've been doing 2x a day since last Wednesday or Thursday on the TargetSmart site. They're a bit behind this site:  https://t.co/gJuOIzCJDU, but the information is more in depth, so more interesting to track.
1320892168609898496 2020-10-27 08:56:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 Says more to come. Can always tack on a surprise MN visit while touring Wisconsin.
1320891815273312256 2020-10-27 08:55:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Beginning to think TargetSmart isn't updating their voter dump because it's embarrassing.
1320889029106257920 2020-10-27 08:44:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Massachusetts votes Trump in response.
1320885511066705920 2020-10-27 08:30:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical He’s technically still in the race I think.
1320883954816339969 2020-10-27 08:24:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I feel like Kanye played the role of Ralph Nader: Got a certain class of Black male to pay attention to the election that didn’t care. They’re now breaking for Trump. That’s where the Trump Black support comes from. Nader had a similar effect on progressives for Gore.
1320880665999646720 2020-10-27 08:11:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Robert’s concurring opinion: I surrender.
1320880455919509507 2020-10-27 08:10:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Amy Coney Barrett’s First Opinion: Trump’s first term doesn’t count because of PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
1320878027773980672 2020-10-27 08:00:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Reporting truth yet again.
1320877881569038337 2020-10-27 08:00:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I hope it is.
1320877549921144833 2020-10-27 07:58:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hakasays @MichaelShinkar @realikamusume Very true.
1320874513891024897 2020-10-27 07:46:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CityBureaucrat I mean, is there anything this guy hasn’t plagiarized? His current slogan was ripped off from @BorisJohnson. Everything this guy does is a rip off. Especially his Covid plan.
1320872948945817603 2020-10-27 07:40:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Trump team is way more confident than this time in 2016.
1320871204937490434 2020-10-27 07:33:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MichaelShinkar @realikamusume He has continued some conflicts in which we were previously engaged. He's mostly just funneling weapons to our allies as far as Yemen goes. Yemen is a much different animal than Syria too.
1320870117845159937 2020-10-27 07:29:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Kane9015 @TheRickWilson College midwit tourists and workers are the worst. The same people here telling you about how to respect diversity and bag on Trump for calling the third world a "shithole" endlessly attempt to alter these people's culture. Personally, I tend to be a "when in Rome" type of guy.
1320868988935700481 2020-10-27 07:24:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Kane9015 @TheRickWilson Yeah, I think exporting the LGBT agenda is probably the number one reason people hate us now. I mean, I'd be pretty pissed if I were them.

1320867841294348291 2020-10-27 07:20:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Kane9015 @TheRickWilson *happened after
1320867779688517632 2020-10-27 07:19:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Kane9015 @TheRickWilson I personally was well below voting or volunteer age, but was caught up in war fever as were many because of 9/11. No one wanted what happened ever. We wanted to go in and kill that terrorist Saddam and maybe setup a puppet government. Not spend years of blood and treasure dying.
1320867437651415041 2020-10-27 07:18:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Kane9015 @TheRickWilson I agree. It was just so bad. Bad for the country. Bad for the Republican Party. Bad for the young men who have needlessly died or otherwise damaged most of all. Yet you still have defenders of our former Middle East policy.
1320866872506593280 2020-10-27 07:16:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed He should send his regards to his predecessor.
1320866031624212482 2020-10-27 07:12:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Kane9015 @TheRickWilson But democracy!  I really wouldn't want to be an impenitent Bush warmonger. I have a feeling judgment would not go so well.
1320864960851943429 2020-10-27 07:08:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you don’t think @TheRickWilson is in it for the grift, I have a bridge I’d like to sell.
1320863352969695232 2020-10-27 07:02:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Guys, this is a joke.
1320856072085753860 2020-10-27 06:33:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks I don’t think this happens, but if it does, Arizonans are to be shunned.

1320853886849196033 2020-10-27 06:24:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Especially at Biden rallies.
1320852045235212288 2020-10-27 06:17:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Do you really believe St. Louis County is going to vote Republican for the first time since 1928, and that Republican will lose?
1320851197549568003 2020-10-27 06:14:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Thread. Trump is a closer. Combine that with the votes still on the table breaking hard for him according to every metric? Two different worlds exist.
1320849481739477000 2020-10-27 06:07:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu Egalitarianism is a left wing idea, and classical liberalism assumes it. It only appears right compared to our modern virulent left.
1320849293226496000 2020-10-27 06:06:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu I think the right, traditionally, is far more pragmatic on economic policy. They'll promote trade when it benefits them, denigrate it when it doesn't, etc.
1320848998740221957 2020-10-27 06:05:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu On economics, I'd classify neoliberalism as fundamentally centre-left. There's two types of left-wing economic ideas: Socialism and Laissez Faire. Laissez Faire still assumes a type of egalitarianism the traditional right would reject. Neoliberalism isn't Laissez Fair, but close.
1320847259614019586 2020-10-27 05:58:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu In terms of policy, definitely. In terms of fundamental political principles, there's definitely something to the idea of left and right because you can almost instinctively recognize a right wing idea from a left wing one, even if they look similar on the surface.
1320846680074407936 2020-10-27 05:56:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Yeah, I don't think the Medieval Kingdom of England was some proto-Marxist State because of the Poor Laws.
1320845889959809026 2020-10-27 05:52:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> My point on economics: You're not some leftist just because you want the government to protect the little guy from having his town pillaged by some robber baron who institutes the right of prima nocta on the peasants.

1320842056105971713 2020-10-27 05:37:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheEorlkonig Ill-gotten gains, perhaps. I really don't like the idea of setting arbitrary caps on how much wealth you can obtain and I think most Historic Americans (and Anglo-Saxons) would find that incredibly distasteful.
1320840934049882114 2020-10-27 05:33:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The red group basically wants strong social security and medicare and strong support for small businesses as opposed to global corporation. They don't want to strip millionaires of their property.

1320838227964678144 2020-10-27 05:22:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks That's part of the Q numbers: Right-wing people are naturally more skeptical of conventional talking points these days
1320836468659683329 2020-10-27 05:15:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There’s definitely some of this. Though, I suspect there’s probably a little the other direction. Not as much, though.
1320834022378000384 2020-10-27 05:05:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @howardfineman Journalists are failed Top 14 Law applicants.
1320832643940950019 2020-10-27 05:00:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed To be fair, even I'd admit *some* of that is his own fault. I also think if anyone was subject to the crazy lens Trump is, we'd probably all fall apart. We still haven't gotten an honest discussion of Trump's central platform after 5.5 years, so we will likely never get one.
1320831997833564161 2020-10-27 04:57:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep People blackpilling on this I think don't appreciate how much more difficult it was to find conservative jurists back in the Reagan-Bush era (and even worse in Nixon). And then they'd get subject to Borkings if they were known quantities.
1320831451189923840 2020-10-27 04:55:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Trump also has the advantage that people actually *agree* with him on almost all the important issues of the day. That's why the entire anti-Trump argument has always been that he's too brash about it. Only possible wrench right now is Covid and Biden's messaging on that is bad.
1320830277309157384 2020-10-27 04:50:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Romney people did this too. "Obama is just a cult of personality!" Like, who cares if he inspires his people to action? That's what leaders are supposed to do. If you can't inspire people to action, you're not a leader.
1320829868117020673 2020-10-27 04:49:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This sentiment is always massive cope. It's reasonable to expect your leaders to inspire you on some level. That's the way we've chosen leaders for thousands of years. Not "well, I guess he ain't so bad."  https://t.co/JJtZ78UgFt
1320829328482066432 2020-10-27 04:47:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm willing to bet this person is a loyal Democrat voter and that's the most they can say.
1320827745878855681 2020-10-27 04:40:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Miami-Dade dumps early vote on Election Day: 40% for Trump. And that's before Election Day vote. "Biden can still make it up in Hillsborough!"
1320826600901038082 2020-10-27 04:36:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu They were good back in the day. They've totally lost the plot since 2010, though. All of their "tossups" end up voting Republican unless there's like a horrific scandal or something. Then some of the lean Ds too.
1320825909839093760 2020-10-27 04:33:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu The only House race that trended Republican in the last Cook update was in Illinois. And that's based off the fake internals they're leaking.
1320824883325128704 2020-10-27 04:29:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu Washington State is harder because the vote is more concentrated in the Seattle Metro and King County is about as crooked as Cook County, Illinois or any other Dem machine county while Multnomah isn't. Overall, the dynamics are similar, though.
1320824561483612165 2020-10-27 04:28:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sgaspari They might as I do think some of the shift is fairly consistent Republican voters among Indies just calling themselves Republican now. However, I do not believe we will see the 20 point margins these polls have (which they also predicted in in 16 ands 18 that didn't happen).
1320823726737444866 2020-10-27 04:24:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu This is in Washington State.
1320823608474767360 2020-10-27 04:24:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu My old home county is showing a huge increase in Modeled Republican vote from 2016. Well more than enough to flip the county and that county is pretty close to the national average every election, though it leans a couple points more Republican.
1320822929437937665 2020-10-27 04:21:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> People who think it's necessary to wear masks outside are peak Covid cringe. Their level of moral signaling is pharisaical.
1320822443854958595 2020-10-27 04:19:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm fairly convinced at this point more Republicans will vote than Democrats at the end of the day. My only question is if they will call themselves Republicans to the exit pollster.
1320821402732253185 2020-10-27 04:15:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jeremy43527949 @CassandraRules Like @Barnes_Law and @Peoples_Pundit pointed out: We Trump supporters are getting creative. Trolling Biden highway signs, etc. People pay attention to this stuff at election time.

1320818131699404801 2020-10-27 04:02:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing Orange County is supposed to be Republican, though. This is a county Republicans can win 70-30 and still lose the state. Trump would need to make serious inroads in Los Angeles, Santa Clara, Contra Costa, and flip all strongholds back GOP like Fresno.
1320817258394984448 2020-10-27 03:59:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing There's just too many raw Dem votes IMO and anti-Trump hysteria is peak in places like the SFO Bay Area and even Orange County. If Orange County goes back GOP, though, that's a Trump landslide nationally and everything we thought we knew about the metro suburbs is wrong.
1320816923362381826 2020-10-27 03:57:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JurisNaturalism California new law: You must hire any minority who applies.   Good news: I'm now Hispanic.   Also good news: Amy Coney Barrett repeals all California gun laws.
1320816578431246338 2020-10-27 03:56:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing I think Trump is going to overperform my expectations. Dems just aren't turning up there like I thought they might. You never know, though, still a week to go and everyone there has a mail in.
1320816126511775745 2020-10-27 03:54:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think Dems are going to have a rough midterm in California in 2022. Their energetic anti-Trumpism is not going to hold regardless of what happens.

If the return rate ends up being a normal 80-85%, that's only 1.6 million Dem votes in the bank. Not many NPAs are voting by mail either, which indicates to me NPAs are going Trump in PA.

1320799338025701380 2020-10-27 02:47:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Turnout is about motivation. If people are motivated to vote, they will get drenched in the rain (or, you know, bring an umbrella) to vote. Trump's Election Day voters are the most motivated voters in the country.
1320798025854439426 2020-10-27 02:42:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 My point. I mean, what are you going to do when the media 24/7 weaponizes the flu against you? Maybe they don't do it with a Rubio Presidency, but all that would prove is how useless a Rubio Presidency would be.

1320786434664681472 2020-10-27 01:56:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I still think Barnes and others are underestimating Trump's chances in Nevada. Yeah, there's fraud that will go down there, but if the Strip Employees want their jobs back, are they really going to vote Biden for more lockdowns? Only so much fraud is possible. @HeritageNLegacy

1320781329584316416 2020-10-27 01:36:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They will not call Indiana when the polls close even if Trump is winning there with more than 60% of the total vote.
1320781194540310528 2020-10-27 01:35:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW The only national poll on lockdowns I've seen in the last month had it underwater 5 points. Only 42% support. Not a winning message for Dems. The poll was very specific: The 47% didn't support more lockdowns under ANY circumstances.
1320780570851500035 2020-10-27 01:33:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical @realikamusume If Trump hits 45% in Louisville, he's doing really well with Blacks very likely.
1320780255922106368 2020-10-27 01:32:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW I agree, but I'd be near certain Trump is going to win if it weren't for Covid. Not even the polls could hide it if we had an honest press on Covid.
1320780042805235712 2020-10-27 01:31:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Please ignore any media spin. Any small Trump regression in some random county will be taken as a sign of things to come. They'll ignore the county right next to it where Trump is doing 5 points better.
1320779279479803904 2020-10-27 01:28:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I believe Rubio likely would have won 2016, against what a lot of my fellow dissident rightists think. However, the only reason Trump isn't coasting to reelection right now is Covid and there's nothing any Republican could have done to stop that spin.

1320777679034044422 2020-10-27 01:21:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical Meanwhile, nothing the NYPost publishes is even worth of investigation despite being sourced beyond "anonymous sources close to Trump we swear are real."

1320776181621379072 2020-10-27 01:15:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume To be fair, if there is a demo of Republicans that might crossover, it's the metro suburban "Romney Republican."

1320775671833124865 2020-10-27 01:13:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical The Dems live in this delusional alternate reality where White Supremacists militiamen have been burning down cities the whole summer to get Trump re-elected. Right....

He was very offended by Access Hollywood. Very offensive to women apparently.

1320764967843467265 2020-10-27 00:31:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaleoEconomist Either losing Europe as an ally because they will be dependent on Chinese controlled oil or alternatively massive energy price increases as US/Canada end up supplying more of Europe's energy needs.
1320764573608300544 2020-10-27 00:29:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 If Trump gets Bush's black margin in Michigan (15% or so) and keeps his 16 coalition mostly intact, he won't win Wayne County, but the margins just won't be there for Democrats even if there is slight shift towards Democrats in Grand Rapids.
1320763725620588546 2020-10-27 00:26:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CelticRoman8 The "modeled party" score in TargetSmart is one such example:  https://t.co/fK8wesDdbL.
1320762424144920579 2020-10-27 00:21:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CelticRoman8 Not individually: That would violate the secret ballot. The partisan scores tend to be accurate, though.
1320762225947250694 2020-10-27 00:20:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 I'm beginning to wonder if these folks can even do basic math. Like, the turnout models aren't there if their polls are right about voting intention. If their polls are right about voting intention, it's too good to be true for Republicans as it stands today.
1320761740267847681 2020-10-27 00:18:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FoundingRequite Bush got 11. It's really where Blacks were before Obama: Somewhere between 10 and 15 and lowish turnout. Seems to be where we're heading right now.
1320761224968228869 2020-10-27 00:16:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FoundingRequite I think he'll improve as a lot of people are showing increased percentages. 27%? More like 12.
1320760180813037568 2020-10-27 00:12:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Ras poll has Trump winning 27% of Blacks. Color me skeptical.
1320759470201425922 2020-10-27 00:09:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Among NPAs, 397,648 have voted in person and 791,303 have voted by mail. I suspect mail ins will tilt Biden and in person will tilt Trump.
1320759066310922250 2020-10-27 00:07:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Republicans are catching up in return rate for FL mail in ballots. They were down by 5% most of last week. Now like 3.5%
1320757267277500416 2020-10-27 00:00:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads And you know whatever Indies show up on the election day are going to break huge for Trump too.

1320748290191855616 2020-10-26 23:25:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CassandraRules These stories get around through the grapevine. You need to talk to your neighbors about it. Spread the word. Take some responsibility. The media won’t help.
1320745876546048002 2020-10-26 23:15:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Almost feels like they’re setting up a massive steal attempt. Like, half of Republicans who mail in ballots don’t vote Trump and literally everyone else votes Biden too? I’m going to need some hard proof of this because it didn’t happen in 16 and he’s more popular in the GOP now.
1320745513180942342 2020-10-26 23:14:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LVB_19 @SelimSeesYou I’ve been trying to dig into these crosstabs. You’d have to assume MASSIVE crossover Republican votes to get this.
1320745280652890113 2020-10-26 23:13:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou This means half of registered Republicans who returned their ballot in PA defected. You buy that?

1320743640868634624 2020-10-26 23:06:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MaritimeLoyal I think it will be closer than people expect, but I’d have to assume Biden will win it at the end of the day.
1320742652053196801 2020-10-26 23:02:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 In PA, that means a full half of registered Republicans who returned their ballots defected. Does anyone buy that?
1320742412491345921 2020-10-26 23:01:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 Means that they are trying to get closer to the average of polls so if they're off, they're as off as everyone else.

1320741315873804290 2020-10-26 22:57:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thevivafrei @NYT @nypost I think we can separate personal and philosophical bias here. I think journalists have gotten too personally involved with their stories for sure. They are personally invested in a candidate winning due to raw prejudice. This is different than agreeing with a party's philosophy.

We should endeavor not to have personal biases as they stem from personal prejudice. Supporting one candidate over another is more indicative of a philosophical bias, which is unavoidable.
1320739751964585984 2020-10-26 22:51:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 I'm also not buying the current "Joementum" story they're selling. Supposedly Joe is gaining after the events of the past week? With who? Where are these people?
1320739513719754759 2020-10-26 22:50:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @yemanouspeak All these polls that slightly overestimated Trump in the popular vote radically changed their methodology while polls that overestimated Clinton haven't.
1320738761190363136 2020-10-26 22:47:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @SelimSeesYou A lot of people in the United States believe in the idea of "divided government." What happened in 2018 was a surge of turnout for both Democrats and Republicans (D edge here) and a swing group of Rs and Is that voted D because of healthcare and to check the Prez.
1320737936216870912 2020-10-26 22:43:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thevivafrei @NYT @nypost I'd rather they be open about their bias than hidden.

I'd say the other polling outlets are risking something, but I genuinely believe the other side here will never learn and keep publishing garbage.
1320728681116028929 2020-10-26 22:07:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I do believe they’re overestimating Texas Republicans, but I doubt enough to lose.
1320728571976032258 2020-10-26 22:06:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Texas overall is the only state with this kind of awe inspiring turnout. Wasserman is really digging for this because everywhere else is way less than his models would expect.  Oh? And the youth vote is only 11% of the vote so far in Texas and AAs are down too.
1320615604085235712 2020-10-26 14:37:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The American people haven’t trusted the media for decades and Trump capitalized on what everyone thought. Meanwhile they desperately try to convince you not to vote for Trump for just about any reason other than the fact you disagree with him because they know you agree with him.

1320581069855481856 2020-10-26 12:20:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @buzzfeedrainbow @RealAPolitics That’s what happened in 2004 even after the exit polls showed a Kerry sweep. Democrats had a pretty abysmal night. And that was with the far less popular George Bush at the top of the ticket.
1320580118989987840 2020-10-26 12:16:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Their problem isn’t how they’re voting. It’s that their people don’t really want to vote.
1320574331479609344 2020-10-26 11:53:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads The Americans won in key battleground Virginia against the coastal urbanite hoards!
1320563810013532160 2020-10-26 11:12:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner @DavidAFrench I’m so disappointed in so many people. Not French specifically, but there turned out to be a whole class of Evangelical strivers who care more about superficial niceties than the meat of policies. They apparently run much of our Church Life.
1320561058113794049 2020-10-26 11:01:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IndependentUnd1 We will all know who won. They won't be able to hide it.

1320560846079250438 2020-10-26 11:00:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The thing about this is: Either the polls were wrong that so many Biden voters already cast ballots, or they were wrong about Trump winning. Either way, the polls are wrong. There's no escaping the fact the polls are wrong.

1320557519924797440 2020-10-26 10:47:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat @PaleoEconomist The AIP exists as a funnel for expressing extreme frustration for the Alaskan political machine, which is pretty corrupt.
1320557129330233350 2020-10-26 10:45:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat @PaleoEconomist Don Blankenship is convicted crook. I don't know why anyone would support him.
1320556802245857280 2020-10-26 10:44:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaleoEconomist @ByzCat That is true. When I voted for Trump, I was honestly of the opinion the only thing that mattered on that front by that point was appointing good judges to chip away at these bad precedents. I think it's working in the long run.
1320556460368109569 2020-10-26 10:42:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat @PaleoEconomist We have definitely discussed many time how Saagar and other "populists" have incredibly unfairly misinterpreted the Tea Party and misrepresented the Trump platform in the first place. They were both grassroots conservative insurgencies, though Trump was less ideological.
1320555760795983877 2020-10-26 10:40:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat @PaleoEconomist Fuentes is just a consistent application of the America First principles Trump ran on.
1320555625739358208 2020-10-26 10:39:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat @PaleoEconomist Yeah, people give Cruz too hard of a time honestly. Trump and Cruz ran on basically the same platform (a couple minor differences). Cruz's argument was "I'm the gentler option."
1320553776579751936 2020-10-26 10:32:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GOrwell2020 I honesty saw most of this stuff coming. I don’t think this makes me some kind of prophet, but it just seemed the inevitable course of events. It has been a bit more intense than perhaps I thought, but that’s not an essential difference.
1320553406654808064 2020-10-26 10:30:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks I really feel like a lot of people have radically different opinions. I’ve basically always been a hard right ideologue with a pragmatic streak at the end of the day.
1320552536378662913 2020-10-26 10:27:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Am I the only guy on this site who believes essentially the same things now that I did in 2016?

1320548018274390018 2020-10-26 10:09:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Wisconsin's vote has slowed to a trickle as of late.

1320547614467784705 2020-10-26 10:07:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Texas is just crazy. Probably really throwing off the national numbers.
1320547322938286080 2020-10-26 10:06:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Which is funny because a Rasmussen poll there from nearly a week ago now said a third had "already voted." I guess 500K ballots are still sitting in the mail somewhere.
1320547088233566208 2020-10-26 10:05:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Interesting thing is some states have kept a rapid pace and others have slowed significantly. For instance, the rust belt had a quick deluge of ballots, but has been a trickle since. True in MN, MI, and WI. PA similar, but they're only at 23% of the 2016 vote.
1320544210135691272 2020-10-26 09:54:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> TargetSmart Report:  Total votes: 54,311,081 Increase: 2,647,234  Youth:  National: 9.9% Battleground: 9.9%  Didn't Votes:  National: 25.3% Battleground: 24.8%  PA still has abysmal Democratic ballot requests, but they weren't updated over the weekend. They have until Tuesday.
1320539922772774912 2020-10-26 09:37:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads These people constantly play fast and loose with numbers. They find one that favors them and hammer it without putting it into context.  And 700K manufacturing jobs don't lie.
1320538099647160321 2020-10-26 09:29:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I can't believe there are still people who defend these policies over this.
1320536651052032000 2020-10-26 09:24:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Step 1: Contract flu. Step 2: Go to doctor. Step 3: Doctor tests for covid. Step 4: Test postive. Step 5: ??? Step 6: Doctor profits.
1320531906602192901 2020-10-26 09:05:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads If the polls are half right as of right now about voting intention, it will be the first time Republicans have outnumbered Democrats at a Presidential General Election since 1928.
1320522906884067328 2020-10-26 08:29:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I enjoy that they are frightening their voters from the polls.
1320521586445864962 2020-10-26 08:24:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot @EPOfficialYT You'd think they'd at least check the current numbers.

1320519384939536386 2020-10-26 08:15:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brettbjj_brett @CrankyFed Yeah, I honestly thing part of it is he doesn't want to give us anymore satisfaction.
1320519151677513730 2020-10-26 08:14:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 @wasphyxiation They did the same thing in 2016: They assumed high turnout was bad for Republicans. It all depends on who does the turning out, doesn't it?
1320518861549150210 2020-10-26 08:13:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation Ideally, in a democracy, we wouldn't care anymore than if our local sports team won or lost, but we don't live in a functioning democracy and haven't for many decades.
1320518642640060422 2020-10-26 08:12:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation Biden will have the power to exercise force to exact vengeance on the right for threatening them with Trump. I think you lack historical perspective on how people feel about this stuff. Political power is why we fight wars. Civil conflicts are the most brutal and passionate.
1320517179201257473 2020-10-26 08:06:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 @wasphyxiation Every year since 2004 the early vote has increased and each year they try to act like it's ogre because one or the other is ahead. The only thing we can infer right now is that the early vote is more Republican than expected.
1320515985661710337 2020-10-26 08:01:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IndependentUnd1 @CrankyFed Yes. If I recall, he spent most of the fall campaign in a New York hotel.
1320515456348884992 2020-10-26 07:59:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 @wasphyxiation About 60 million. Estimated 50-40-10 D-R-I. Dems would need significant R loyalist defection to have locked this up.
1320515059177631745 2020-10-26 07:58:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed It's something you do only if you think going out loses you votes. Or maybe your candidate doesn't have the energy. Plenty of other reasons besides they think he's going to win.   And, of course, the last guy who did this lost after a 9.5 point polling error.
1320513299931430913 2020-10-26 07:51:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @randomblacgurl I can say a lot of stuff here that perhaps you can infer.
1320512398382501893 2020-10-26 07:47:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FlycatcherSilky I'm saying it's possible to read these things anyway you want. It's why I don't say "oh, guy is doing this, therefore he must be winning/losing" except on a very high level. Losing campaigns throw Hail Maries (see McCain PA 2008). Winning campaigns shore up strongholds.
1320512039387910144 2020-10-26 07:46:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BibMccafferty I mentioned this earlier: I don't really pay too much attention to VP visits. They're more about good will than trying to win. Maybe they're trying to win, but so many people have already voted there that if they won, they've already won.
1320511659417456646 2020-10-26 07:44:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Beakerlives He seems alive and he's just talking about a mask.
1320511559932760067 2020-10-26 07:44:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation I mean, there's a huge risk here of validating a Trump narrative: Biden's an oaf who can't handle the job. If they think he's winning, they think the votes are already in the bank, which I don't see how it's mathematically possible with the returns so far.
1320510909320671234 2020-10-26 07:41:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Beakerlives His family agrees.
1320510298147663873 2020-10-26 07:39:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Biden Campaign is really all in on the Covid is a disaster by the Bad Orange Man narrative. Like I mentioned: Campaigns are selling narratives. That’s the Biden narrative. Could just be that.
1320508931618312192 2020-10-26 07:33:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @realikamusume I wouldn't say that. Covid is a big x factor here.
1320508381392678914 2020-10-26 07:31:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @realikamusume They’re convinced he already has his votes in the bank too.
1320507291305680896 2020-10-26 07:27:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 They're coping. It looks really bad.
1320503124558315523 2020-10-26 07:10:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Souls to the Polls total failure. Blacks don’t want to vote for an old creepy White guy who insults them.
1320502539960373248 2020-10-26 07:08:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CoastTwo @thehangingchads You’re actually stupid.
1320501859250032646 2020-10-26 07:05:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_KarthikAFC @Oblivion2elect1 @RedEaglePatriot Nevada has party registration, but it’s not hard to infer actual political leanings with TargetSmart’s data. Republicans are running on pace in terms of party registration split from 2016, but significantly better in inferred Republicans.
1320499435437260802 2020-10-26 06:56:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_KarthikAFC @Oblivion2elect1 @RedEaglePatriot Both.
1320494792602722305 2020-10-26 06:37:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed You know, this is a more complicated question. It’s perfectly reasonable that people had a better philosophy of life on the whole centuries ago than they do now. This would be entirely consistent with the Christian idea of wealth corrupting your moral compass.
1320494283821064192 2020-10-26 06:35:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu @CelticRoman8 That’s a reasonable assumption right now, actually. Still could break big for the GOP depending on Election Day vote.
1320493941830127616 2020-10-26 06:34:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CelticRoman8 @nossgiu I don’t know what he’s talking about. Arizona looks close, but 20% of the vote will be Election Day and GOP will win 3:1.
1320493747138973696 2020-10-26 06:33:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CelticRoman8 @nossgiu This is supposed to be the first election most voters vote early and we’re not there yet and a disproportionate amount of the mail votes are coming from CA and TX is basically all in person early votes.
1320493244283822081 2020-10-26 06:31:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu I assume that’s mail: We probably won’t get 80 million mail votes. We probably will get 80-100 million early votes total, including in person. This is tilted by CA being nearly all mail in this year.
1320489915747127296 2020-10-26 06:18:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pontificatormax @thehangingchads Speaking of PA: Lou Barletta did really well for someone running against a Casey in PA. The midterm prior the seat was up, Casey beat a Republican incumbent by 17 points.
1320486388664537090 2020-10-26 06:04:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu I can see scenarios where 150 million vote and Trump wins anyway, btw. Maybe even more.
1320486044870103041 2020-10-26 06:03:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu If Biden wins, about 150-155 million will vote. Some of those extra folks will vote Trump.
1320485448716853250 2020-10-26 06:00:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu I'm confident he will right now even if he loses. I was not confident about this when October started. The turnout is going to be insane and it's going to be Republicans doing the voting.
1320484562754035712 2020-10-26 05:57:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Comparing House elections to Prez races is the exact mistake Romney made. Keep going, Mr. Enten.
1320484320453287937 2020-10-26 05:56:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Rona breakout middle of this week. Biden voters stop early voting. Didn't request absentee ballots: Too late. Don't show up on election day. Trump wins by 10 million votes.
1320483604326195201 2020-10-26 05:53:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TRElections @Barnes_Law Maricopa County voted for Trump in the 2016 primary by a significant margin. Same in Bucks. Plenty of Trumpers to bolster Election Day turnout in those places and there are more Trumpers today than 4 years ago.
1320482580031045633 2020-10-26 05:49:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Harriso95417155 @Barnes_Law Only in their jurisdictions. The election judge in Luzerne County, PA won't put up with that.
1320481707297001481 2020-10-26 05:45:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law They cannot shut down a polling place. That's illegal.
1320481026683080706 2020-10-26 05:43:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy I enjoy the feeling as well. But it's not, like, hard. Then again, I've never encountered a line longer than maybe 5 minutes. I usually choose to go when no one else will be there, though.
1320480212447076352 2020-10-26 05:39:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I still really don't get why people act like voting is some big accomplishment.
1320479803665977346 2020-10-26 05:38:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Some people are nuts, man.
1320477631897325568 2020-10-26 05:29:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu Guess that's her comeuppance. She beat Bob Dornan in her first election on fraudulent illegal immigrant votes.
1320477310949171203 2020-10-26 05:28:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu I don't get how Loretta Sanchez didn't win that election. She should have gotten the Hispanic and the Republican vote (she was the more moderate candidate). What do I know I guess.
1320474177770500096 2020-10-26 05:15:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu @RedEaglePatriot I want to humiliate them, though.
1320473990339710976 2020-10-26 05:15:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Max_Rohtbart @RedEaglePatriot New Hampshire because it is decided by late breaking Independents and I believe those will break hard for Trump this year.

1320470154778738693 2020-10-26 04:59:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I really don't pay too much attention to where VPs go. Harris might be more important than most VPs, but VP trips are often more about expressions of good will than serious attempts to win a particular area.
1320469333605273600 2020-10-26 04:56:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law @CBSNewsPoll @YouGov I dug into the Florida numbers: Definitely overestimated Biden among already voteds, more than his entire lead.   These polls better start praying they're wrong among "yet to votes" or it's going to be one ugly night for the Democrat Party.
1320468601485303820 2020-10-26 04:53:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @kelli09372726 @AirBossUT5 Stop listening to these people. They are misrepresenting data to you.

1320459585627578368 2020-10-26 04:17:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RhoadsCannon @LarrySchweikart There was a Dallas Morning News poll. Pretty sure they had Clinton ahead too.
1320459215186649089 2020-10-26 04:16:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Armenians have been a loyal Republican voting bloc since their arrival in the United States.
1320455990815395841 2020-10-26 04:03:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I was going to say that: Trump's base only falters when they feel he's too influenced by Washington Elites.
1320455444813516802 2020-10-26 04:01:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 I assume the orange cones are the electioneering boundaries.
1320454564911472642 2020-10-26 03:57:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Political analysts overanalyze things. They see Trump run a 2016 full of gaffes and no endorsements and he wins. So they think gaffes and endorsements don't matter. They ignore that campaigns are selling narratives to voters and those things didn't matter for Trump's narrative.
1320451327818928134 2020-10-26 03:45:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou A passport is always the strongest form of identification you can have. It proves who you are and your eligibility to exercise all the rights of a US Citizen in one.
1320446387776081920 2020-10-26 03:25:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton These folks share this and don't notice these polls show Trump losing White support, not from WWC people (mostly), but from suburban women who think Trump is "racist." Hardly indicative of a need to push immigration more.
1320445646478974986 2020-10-26 03:22:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mike_schietzelt @TheRealKDuff @LarrySchweikart I agree. I honestly think the overall national electorate might end up being plurality Republican for the first time in a Presidential Election since we've had exit polls. If the polls are right at all about how many Republicans are voting Trump on Election Day.
1320444298568093697 2020-10-26 03:17:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mike_schietzelt @TheRealKDuff @LarrySchweikart It bodes well, but presenting it as a negative number is a bit misleading. Those are still Dem votes. I agree Dems are out of juice, but that’s because the young people don’t want to vote for old, corrupt Joe.
1320443965263519745 2020-10-26 03:15:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @JurisNaturalism @RealAPolitics Only 55% of eligible White Working Class voters voted in 2016. 57% of eligible Blacks. If Blacks go down, Whites go up, and any Hispanic increase goes to Trump? Lots of juice left to squeeze for Republicans.
1320443119020756992 2020-10-26 03:12:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @JurisNaturalism @RealAPolitics As the early vote trickles in, it’s just plainly obvious this electorate is older, Whiter, and more Republican than anyone thought.
1320442018355695618 2020-10-26 03:08:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The entire point of 538 is to find good betting odds and they’re terrible at it.
1320439709655572483 2020-10-26 02:58:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m really looking forward to hearing reports of long lines at the Election Day polls throughout the country.
1320439379387703297 2020-10-26 02:57:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Getting dozens of people to show up for Democrats in Detroit. Harrismentum.
1320438774527107073 2020-10-26 02:55:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JurisNaturalism @LuisBobby3 @RealAPolitics I’m constantly trying to check my optimism at this point, but the only contrary evidence at this point is the top line of veritably bunk polls.
1320438350499774465 2020-10-26 02:53:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads They never address truth. They always just try to question the source. “Well, Hillary’s emails came from Russia, so don’t listen.” So what if they did? Are they her emails or not? If they are, I don’t care if the KGB dropped them and they were published by some pinko commie.
1320435513829040128 2020-10-26 02:42:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @VGKVegas @TheRealKDuff @LarrySchweikart Overall, I agree. Republicans have a lot of gas left in the tank and Democratic turnout slows by the day while GOP is staying relatively flat, preparing for an Election Day explosion. Overall I’m very optimistic. Just saying I don’t want that number to get too negative.
1320435155975180291 2020-10-26 02:40:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JurisNaturalism @LuisBobby3 @RealAPolitics I agree, I’m just saying they’re obviously just playing damage control. Every moment Biden appears endangers House and Senate Dems, regardless of the state of Presidential race.
1320434900995112963 2020-10-26 02:39:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Democrats are going to need an unprecedented ballot return rate in Florida to be confident going into Election Day. At 90%, they’re at 2.4 million. Mind you Hill got 4.5 million votes.
1320432306407022593 2020-10-26 02:29:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Man77Nc @TheRealKDuff @LarrySchweikart I understand, but if that negative number is growing it’s still Dem votes in the bank. I’m honestly not worried about Florida much at this point at all. It’s pretty clear they underestimated Republican turnout in the state.
1320432095139909633 2020-10-26 02:28:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @VGKVegas @TheRealKDuff @LarrySchweikart It’s not that bad. I’m just saying it’s not good news. Of course there are unreliable voters showing up in a Presidential Election: They always do.
1320431076838412290 2020-10-26 02:24:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Should I be freaked out? Have demons awoken?

1320427809970495488 2020-10-26 02:11:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics These people never articulate policies. They just complain about mean tweets. Intellectual midgets. It’s actually exactly what Jesus complains about the Pharisees: More focused on appearances than real jobs in the Iron Range and rust belt.
1320426978537803776 2020-10-26 02:08:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheRealKDuff @LarrySchweikart This is actually a bad thing. Means that non-super voters are turning out. Of course, it’s not that bad. Presidential elections always have a lot of inconsistent voters and the GOP is getting them too.
1320426501402144768 2020-10-26 02:06:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This just makes me angry. My grandmother was a lifelong Democrat and irrationally hated Trump. I couldn’t imagine even discussing politics with her in her dying days. We talked about family recipes and old stories like normal human beings.
1320425578416218115 2020-10-26 02:02:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Kentucky doesn’t have partisan registration lol.
1320424741400924160 2020-10-26 01:59:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 If Trump gets his 2016 coalition, plus the Hispanic vote, he *could* win with 51% of the vote. Margin doesn’t really matter if it’s an actual majority.

1320418480055877633 2020-10-26 01:34:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WesfromF She can be sworn in as soon as the Chief Justice receives her judicial commission, which can be done hastily (within an hour or two).
1320418238690398208 2020-10-26 01:33:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jroxer99 Yes. I wish I could hedge here. Most I can hedge is that nothing in life is certain until it happens and maybe I’ll have egg on my face. I just don’t see a path for Biden at this point.
1320417630906437632 2020-10-26 01:31:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Cloture invoked on Barrett! She will be a Justice of the Supreme Court tomorrow.
1320414642724810752 2020-10-26 01:19:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiah_crawley Older more conservative voters are definitely the most reliable voters in the whole and that’s part of what gives the GOP a decent floor. However, that definitely isn’t the whole picture.
1320414086266523656 2020-10-26 01:17:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiah_crawley Trump’s strongest base (White Working Class) only turned out 55% last time: Less than the 57% of the potential Black vote. Hispanics have abysmal turnout rates, though. They’d favor Dems likely.
1320413775216914433 2020-10-26 01:15:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiah_crawley It all depends on who does the turning out. The idea every potential Trump voter voted for him in 2016 is patently ridiculous. If absolutely everyone turned out, the electorate would probably slightly favor Dems, but not as much as people think.
1320412229481750535 2020-10-26 01:09:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Last two Democrats were re-elected on decreased turnout funny enough.
1320411933519040520 2020-10-26 01:08:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nc_groyp @SelimSeesYou Especially because California sent out unsolicited mail ins to the whole state. Trump will get his 31% in California he got last time: Maybe more.
1320411688529702914 2020-10-26 01:07:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RockyMountViews @Beakerlives How about you reach out an olive branch instead of threaten our ways of life?
1320411438712840193 2020-10-26 01:06:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Beakerlives @RockyMountViews I posted the per capita deaths: under 600 per million versus over 1800 for NJ.  https://t.co/o6OBhuzKx0
1320410543245660162 2020-10-26 01:03:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @down_the_summit @SelimSeesYou Texas’s population has increased significantly. More votes doesn’t necessarily mean more turnout in terms of percentage of eligible voters.
1320410088197206017 2020-10-26 01:01:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou It means Texas might see the craziest turnout you’ve ever seen.
1320409152145993734 2020-10-26 00:57:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @RealAPolitics I lean towards that. Every time he leaves his basement to speak he just offends someone. Even if he somehow has this in the bag, he’s only hurting down ballot Democrats by speaking. If people really hate Trump that much, they could vote GOP in the House and Senate to check Biden.
1320408526385258496 2020-10-26 00:54:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This will be a historic election no matter what happens, but I feel strongly it will be a historic turnout among Trump’s base to defend their President and he will get enough Dems and Indies to get over the top.
1320408123383971842 2020-10-26 00:53:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The only way Trump loses at this point is if he has HUGE base problems, and there’s no evidence of this anywhere. Even the polls say the Republican base is on his side. Only other possibility is he gets absolutely clobbered among Indies at historic levels.
1320407799713665027 2020-10-26 00:52:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All of these polls build Biden’s lead on the basis of the early vote. There’s no doubt Biden is leading among those who have already cast votes. However, the electorate is far more Republican than anyone ever expected and it only get more GOP by the day.
1320405274398687233 2020-10-26 00:42:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 The Republican Party is over for good because Drumpf! How dare you deplorables even try!

1320404387420798976 2020-10-26 00:38:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Interesting
1320403138990493696 2020-10-26 00:33:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 It was one poll.
1320402187206393856 2020-10-26 00:29:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It still appears to have overestimated Democrats among Already Voteds.
1320401737052786692 2020-10-26 00:28:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This Florida poll is the first one I’ve seen that did not obviously over sample Already Voteds.
1320401041066688524 2020-10-26 00:25:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 Hispanics aren’t much of a thing in Michigan there. Probably huge sampling error there.
1320400155095584769 2020-10-26 00:21:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 The traditional early vote strat was to get your super voters in the bank so you could focus on the new guys. This never worked. Dems will probably keep trying this again and again because it’s what the “science” says to do or something.
1320399635123474432 2020-10-26 00:19:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 The Democrat strategy is more traditional. The Republican strategy is new and it’s more balanced. A lot of GOP new voters are still to vote on Election Day because GOP new voters are big fans of Trump and he said to vote in person or on Election Day.
1320399172831502338 2020-10-26 00:17:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TiddieChvmper2 He gives Big Data Poll an F when they only have an average polling error of R+0.4, which is basically just noise.
1320398796744986631 2020-10-26 00:16:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @markjbult @RealAPolitics He’s right where Hillary was in the battleground states lmao and we know they’re running behind polling in early vote. Like, it’s just a joke to think this is a Biden landslide at this point.
1320395952214200323 2020-10-26 00:05:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @RealAPolitics So did one Thomas Dewey’s before there was a 9.5 point polling error.

1320270781444751362 2020-10-25 15:47:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical @eball0911 Someone in one of the media outlets in 1972 said they didn’t know a single person who voted for Nixon. Like: It was 60% of the country and he won two boroughs of NYC, and got 48% in Brooklyn. What kind of privileged isolated ingrates were these people?
1320269128746323969 2020-10-25 15:41:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OVonReuenthal @realikamusume They’re overestimating Dems in St. Louis County. I guarantee it. A lot of people that would be a “modeled Democrat” in Duluth will be voting Trump.
1320268807609421825 2020-10-25 15:39:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @guru_scout @davidchapman141 You should look at Youth Iowa turnout: They’re not even keeping pace with their 2016 share of the early vote. Youth turnout is going to be abysmal unless they show up on Election Day.
1320268212269973505 2020-10-25 15:37:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheSadioRole @eball0911 Yeah. The only question was if he would win the whole rust belt or some combination thereof. He only needed one, so they knew it was hopeless.
1320267808110936065 2020-10-25 15:35:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical @eball0911 People have been doing this to Republicans for decades now. Republican landslide night they’re all like “let’s not be too hasty.” When Democrats edge out Republicans as soon as the polls close they’re like “it’s over, Dems won it all, go home.”
1320267076469182464 2020-10-25 15:32:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 Let them cope while they still can.
1320265947777765378 2020-10-25 15:28:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WhateverUchoose @realikamusume So he can continue to fool West Virginia into giving their votes indirectly to Chuck Schumer? Yes.
1320262358464430080 2020-10-25 15:14:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperHeisen @tonybalogna @Interstate_85 700K manufacturing jobs don’t lie and there are whole regions of the rust belt where economic activity has boomed. Why do you think 6 Democratic Mayors in the heart of the Iron Range bucked their party to endorse Trump? Their towns have flourished under his policies.
1320261647924158469 2020-10-25 15:11:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hall511Ricky @MuddyCuck @RyanGirdusky @RedEaglePatriot It’s not like this is the only place this is happening. Polls across the board are doing two things: 1. Overestimating how many have already voted. 2. Underestimating Republican affiliation among those who have. Florida is a good control here as FL has partisan registration.

1320251867692228608 2020-10-25 14:32:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Beakerlives North Dakota is 21st among the states in terms of per capita Covid deaths. And no one will catch up to New York or New Jersey.
1320250787159805957 2020-10-25 14:28:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Beakerlives Also, your candidate only raises money from big donors. Trump is killing him in number of donors and that’s why he has raised far more money in places like Macomb County, Michigan and Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.
1320248589977792512 2020-10-25 14:19:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Has there been a single Covid death linked to a Trump rally? There’s been plenty of time for one to happen.
1320248381147668481 2020-10-25 14:18:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Beakerlives Still no mass death. Death rates in the tank. When will you just admit you’re a coward who can’t handle life? It’s a respiratory illness. There’s no magic voodoo that’s going to make it go away.

If Trump gets done what he needs to do personally over his next term, Pence will execute Trump term 3 effectively. What happens thereafter is real up to him, but eventually Barron is likely to be a factor.
1320240327555452928 2020-10-25 13:46:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BasedMorrowind @MechInATek1997 Why not? If Hispanics vote 40% for Trump, as is quite possible right now, that's enough to keep the GOP competitive well into the future even if demographic change continues. If they change immigration law (which Trump still promises on the trail), it will reorient politics.
1320239925980237824 2020-10-25 13:45:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BasedMorrowind @MechInATek1997 People listen to these folks, but once they hear someone running as Trump Pt. 2, they'll flock to their banner.
1320239413578862592 2020-10-25 13:42:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BasedMorrowind @MechInATek1997 Depends on what happens in 10 days. If it breaks wildly for Trump, they just need to embrace Trumpism and hope to have a New Deal-type realignment, which we haven't had since the New Deal.
1320239067913740288 2020-10-25 13:41:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BasedMorrowind @MechInATek1997 Trump lives by the old adage "keep your friends close, and your enemies closer." Trump is one by one removing people from political relevance. People don't know it yet, but Haley was ruined by her appointment to the UN. Many such tales will be told.
1320238521467142145 2020-10-25 13:39:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BasedMorrowind @MechInATek1997 These people are only popular insofar as they defend Trump. The people they want to be the next Republican nominee will not have any traction.
1320238003617472512 2020-10-25 13:37:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BasedMorrowind @MechInATek1997 Under Trump, the direction is good. Support Trump. Support American Caesarism.

1320233721820307458 2020-10-25 13:20:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @based_LI @SelimSeesYou Not saying it was a perfect stand in: But often you'd see Clinton+10 polls, but the generic ballot was tied. Which one do you think was closer?   As for incumbency: It was not statistically a factor in 2018 and incumbency tends to regress as a factor for freshmen in Prez years.
1320233176887853056 2020-10-25 13:18:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BibMccafferty @SelimSeesYou There is, but there's only 5 polls, not including this one, and two are stale (from September). Notable, USC Dornsife has the Presidential race as Biden+11 and the House at Dems+7. They actually had the Dems at +15 in 2018 in their final poll.
1320231753647333377 2020-10-25 13:12:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cogi2_ErgoTsun Shh....let me meme.
1320231587565490176 2020-10-25 13:11:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd Seriously. Like, we know this stuff is true. We know Epstein was a thing and all these creeps knew what he was up to. They try to divorce this from the rest of our knowledge, but people know about Epstein.
1320231149181063168 2020-10-25 13:10:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joshualucas @KelleyNorth @austintwelch @Peoples_Pundit I think one of their problems is they're oversampling highly engaged people (the type of people who vote first) and right now, there's a group of liberals and left-leaning moderates who are just very engaged in their Anti-Trump fanaticism.
1320230312748765185 2020-10-25 13:06:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump carries Oregon after exorcized of demons.
1320229249098416134 2020-10-25 13:02:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If Republicans lose the national House vote by 4, they could recapture the majority.  Also noteworthy that, if I recall, the 2016 Generic Ballot was a more useful metric for the actual state of the Trump v. Clinton race than the top line.
1320227697872830464 2020-10-25 12:56:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> People are so excited about Biden, they won't even show up to a Cher concert to listen to the Biden pitch. Maybe this says more about what a has been Cher has become of late than Biden, though.
1320226586403241986 2020-10-25 12:52:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joshualucas @KelleyNorth @austintwelch @Peoples_Pundit None of those 4 numbers make any sense, either. Yesterday, only 50% of the vote was in from 2016, today 53 (some from in person voting that occurred after the poll). Florida has increased in pop since 2016 too. They're either predicting low turnout or it makes no sense.
1320223557004283904 2020-10-25 12:39:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tonybalogna @BasadoChino He has been hitting the peace deals hard in the Midwest, at least. They have a big impact there.
1320222159323750400 2020-10-25 12:34:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tonybalogna @BasadoChino Right now, Dems would have to return like 90% of their requested ballots (an insanely high number historically) to even have a prayer, I think. Unless independents swing against Trump by a large margin.
1320219966604517377 2020-10-25 12:25:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tonybalogna @BasadoChino Referring to 2016.
1320219881950842881 2020-10-25 12:25:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tonybalogna @BasadoChino Know what's good to know? The insiders (in Trump's own campaign) were convinced he had lost the morning of the election. It wasn't until they heard turnout reports in his strongholds they thought they even had a shot.
1320218010880180224 2020-10-25 12:17:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiahgameking2 This is the result I pray we avoid.
1320216691599724544 2020-10-25 12:12:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheBigProp @SirDowden You can also increase turnout and shrink Cook to a lower portion of the statewide vote. In Minnesota, Trump lost last time because his counties had like 60-70% turnout while MSP had 80%. Same thing happens in IL and NY.
1320216191105961985 2020-10-25 12:10:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheBigProp @SirDowden You lose 100% of the time you didn't try.
1320216001158520833 2020-10-25 12:09:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheBigProp @SirDowden I don't what you're not seeing. 100% of Cook County's vote is about 38%. If you take 20% of that vote (Trump got 21), you're ~7.5% of the statewide vote. You need to win 70% of the non-Cook vote. Hard? Yes. Impossible? It has been done.
1320214728996769792 2020-10-25 12:04:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheBigProp @SirDowden I mean, Bush got within 10. Combine Trump's Illinois Coalition with Bush's and you have a majority.
1320214577422999552 2020-10-25 12:04:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheBigProp @SirDowden With the crazy number of Covid relocations, we might see some bizarre results this election. People aren't even considering this. People have vacated New York City. If the back country shows up in force and gives crazy margins to Trump and the City is desperate....
1320213852013854727 2020-10-25 12:01:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheBigProp @SirDowden Republicans can flip Illinois eventually.
1320213345329434631 2020-10-25 11:59:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Sleep is for the dead.
1320212984380248065 2020-10-25 11:57:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @TheBigProp You can see the difference even in early voting: Maine 2 is listening to the President and not voting. Maine 1 is voting early.
1320212780943872000 2020-10-25 11:57:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @TheBigProp I mean, theoretically the votes between the two should be roughly. However, the politics of these two districts are crazy far apart. Trump could easily win ME-2 by 10 points, but lose ME-1 by 20.
1320211548036628480 2020-10-25 11:52:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @TheBigProp I'm just not very optimistic about Maine. My understanding is the Portland professional class is even more far to the left than they were 2016. I think Trump will hold Maine 2, but regress in Maine-1. Also, they're doing instant run off for Presidential voting.
1320210959840018432 2020-10-25 11:49:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiahgameking2 Big echoes of 1948 in 2020. Incumbent who just lost a high turnout historic midterm facing several crises. Challenger leading big in the polls, barely even campaigning. But the incumbent has a lot of support in the back country.....
1320209725741465606 2020-10-25 11:45:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheBigProp @SirDowden He's talking about the "Yankee" states in the Civil War. Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Iowa, and Maine? maybe for number 9.
1320207483420479488 2020-10-25 11:36:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiahgameking2 It's not even like the young people requested ballots they just haven't returned yet, they never even asked for them. On top of that, they're returning the ones they did ask for more slowly than they would like for sure.
1320207276813275138 2020-10-25 11:35:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiahgameking2 Yeah, the problem for Dems just hasn't been resolved yet. The electorate is still older and Whiter. They will need Blacks and the youth to show up on Election Day because they're not early voting and they haven't even requested mail ballots. The word there is requested.
1320206449834926081 2020-10-25 11:32:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NewEra_05 They'll use any excuse to take away our great Second Amendment.
1320205591856484354 2020-10-25 11:28:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ObservingStill @Crystal__Monroe @Travis95139024 Even if it was just the Republicans and known Trump-leaners, I remember phone banking for McCain and Romney. McCain had zero excitement. In my state, lots of people planned to vote in the governor's race and not for him. I didn't really care. We all knew McCain was a loser.
1320201763144740865 2020-10-25 11:13:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Duke_Libertas LOL, that was in Portland, Oregon. Of course, that was Bush era. There weren't roving bands of antifa threatening your life back then.
1320201301066735617 2020-10-25 11:11:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Salt_miner69 @RealAPolitics People who read election mafia headlines out of context and think it's over for Trump.
1320200840557244417 2020-10-25 11:09:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Maybe it's dawning on Democrats that having your entire party base gerrymander themselves into apartment complex echo chambers isn't a good move to win over real voters. I hope not, I prefer they remain ignorant.
1320199545771491330 2020-10-25 11:04:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I mean, they are probably known Republican leaners that they are calling. Still, I phonebanked in 2008 to get in the party's good graces and people were not, shall we say, excited about voting for McCain.
1320198929397501953 2020-10-25 11:02:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Duke_Libertas I'll never forget going to a "talkfest" in 2004 when I was a kid (my folks were always politically involved) and the Bush/Cheney desk was staffed by these gorgeous girls and the Kerry/Edwards desk was staffed by some real uggos. I'm like "no thanks."
1320198517894352902 2020-10-25 11:00:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump: "We're going to win everywhere! It would be embarrassing if we didn't!"  Biden: "Please, we need more cash for our flailing campaign, Trump up, please, it's ogre if you don't."  I don't think it takes a psych master's to figure out which one is the winning message.
1320194826940391426 2020-10-25 10:45:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> More foreign election interference for Biden/Harris.
1320194009600561152 2020-10-25 10:42:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NewEra_05 They do that as well.
1320193948971900929 2020-10-25 10:42:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Let's do some quick math. If 100% of the 25% of the county (last I checked) who hate mask support Trump and a third of the 75% of the country who support mask mandates support Trump, then Trump wins. This is how margins work for the ill-informed.   BTW, I think it's lower now.
1320193360091598849 2020-10-25 10:39:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These people don't think Trump supporters wear masks when asked politely to do so. That's their gauge of Biden support.
1320191648480059393 2020-10-25 10:33:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JurisNaturalism @realikamusume I like how they read the tea leaves over one rally, but fail to notice Biden is camped in Pennsylvania for dear life as hordes of Trump supporters heckle him. Pennsylvania is the Democratic Florida: If Trump was in Florida all the time they'd be saying he's desperate.
1320191052477812736 2020-10-25 10:30:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly @realikamusume They were really hoping they'd just be able to get a flood of mail ins banked before the election actually happened while Republicans were discouraged by polls. Problem was that no one ever bought the polls and the optimism and energy is too much to hide now.
1320190593612566531 2020-10-25 10:29:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @RealAPolitics I think everyone knows at this point that all Trump needs is to win a coin flip or two. Even if you half buy the polls.
1320189116974321666 2020-10-25 10:23:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JurisNaturalism @realikamusume Did he see the rally in Beverly Hills for Trump? Maybe Biden needs to shore some support there like he did in Delaware yesterday.
1320188892167929856 2020-10-25 10:22:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly @realikamusume @Barnes_Law 8 PM: Fox News Election Alert, Trump leading in New Hampshire.

1320187869152071680 2020-10-25 10:18:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume They're like "yo, hey, we're not out of the woods yet here in Colorado, don't mind Nate."
1320187510694289408 2020-10-25 10:16:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Republican Party was founded in Wisconsin, good that he's hitting on that history there.
1320187386735755266 2020-10-25 10:16:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Someone just yelled "40 more years" from the crowd. LOL.

1320185257312854016 2020-10-25 10:07:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden Casting a wide net, ok. lol.
1320184464295813121 2020-10-25 10:04:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm philosophizing the fact I really just want to ask for their phone number.
1320184314152312832 2020-10-25 10:04:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The girls over Trump's right shoulder are cute. Aren't Republican women just more attractive? It's because their souls aren't consumed by darkness.
1320182479530196992 2020-10-25 09:56:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I honestly don't even believe it's close this time. I wish I could hedge here. The energy is just too high. The optimism just too much. He didn't even need this scandal. Maybe he needed the debate performance to give him the momentum, but the laptop? Just icing.
1320182044329127936 2020-10-25 09:55:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I think both the polls were fake, but the election was so close in the key rust belt state, it likely was what put him over the top.   I mean, Clinton was never up 15 like some of the polls said. It was never tied in Indiana or Missouri.
1320181594158780417 2020-10-25 09:53:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wandlearner @realikamusume @SelimSeesYou That's true. Boosting energy in Ohio does boil over into Pennsylvania at least. Given my knowledge of Ohio-Michigan relations, they might want to use Indianans in Michigan...
1320181000123654147 2020-10-25 09:50:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump's recounting of the CNN Minneapolis reporting was gold.  https://t.co/7el5wnfS9S
1320180445301116928 2020-10-25 09:48:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> CNN Sucks! CNN Sucks! CNN Sucks!
1320179922573328384 2020-10-25 09:46:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @SelimSeesYou All politics is local. Ten points in Ohio is close enough maybe some people don't show just because they didn't like that Trump didn't visit. People can be petty.
1320179613914550278 2020-10-25 09:45:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK "Pay no attention to the army at the gates!"
1320179384507092997 2020-10-25 09:44:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks He kind of did, just not as often.
1320178184671973376 2020-10-25 09:39:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Can Trump keep these rallies going after his Presidency? Like, these things are amazing.
1320177678230687745 2020-10-25 09:37:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "Sanders is a good sport." Donald Trump at his rally. LOL
1320176853857017856 2020-10-25 09:34:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 Honestly, if they're only at 54% after only a few days of in person early voting, it's not going to be pretty. Everyone is expecting Trump to win Election Day vote. Even the polls that have him down 10 points expect him to win 2:1 on Election Day.
1320176014924853251 2020-10-25 09:31:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ElanExcess @EMichaelFrens @thehangingchads And let them know how many of us there are? You can't plan your life because of some off chance some disaster strikes. If you can predict it might happen, then sure, but not just because "oh, no, what if I get in an auto accident, etc."
1320175453496315904 2020-10-25 09:28:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DreadPennies @ElanExcess @EMichaelFrens @thehangingchads Totals. Mind you, Trump got 34% in this county.  https://t.co/cBQc2bn9L3
1320174319331401728 2020-10-25 09:24:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat Nikki Haley ain't happening. Stop interacting with these neocon troll. You're more likely to be a GOP Presidential nominee than that chick.
1320173884642070533 2020-10-25 09:22:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Dude, there were more people at that rally than in the county it was located. Whole town appeared to be lining the streets. Energy boost!
1320172617953935362 2020-10-25 09:17:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiahgameking2 GOP or Dems?
1320172274348064768 2020-10-25 09:16:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The last poll that I saw in NC expected Trump to win the election day 3:1 22.5%:7.5% of the overall vote. By this calculation, Trump has already won the state of North Carolina according to a poll that had Biden winning it by 2%.
1320170404036694017 2020-10-25 09:08:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If the trend of the previous week had continued throughout the past week, it was looking truly disastrous for Dems. Republicans definitely have a lot of juice left to squeeze out there, though. Dems are struggling in their low propensity voters.
1320170103581908993 2020-10-25 09:07:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> TargetSmart report:  Total Vote: 51,663,847 Increase: 3,926,459  Youth:  National: 9.7% Battleground: 9.6%  Did not votes: National: 25.1% Battleground: 24.5%  Conclusion from this week: Democrat have gotten numbers up enough they're still in the game.

1320167290927800320 2020-10-25 08:56:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @austintwelch @Peoples_Pundit I meant in raw support, total that's a 9 point swing for the President.
1320166916825239552 2020-10-25 08:54:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Nuns are sneaking out of their convents to cheer for Trump and he’s supposedly going to lose by tens of millions of votes.  https://t.co/HNXEXlYFrF

1320161348580507648 2020-10-25 08:32:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> None of these match what the polls are expecting the margins to be with the possible exception of Michigan.

1320156959480467456 2020-10-25 08:15:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is 4 points behind what St. Pete polls has it for Biden. An 8 point swing. Biden eked out a 1.5 point win in that survey.
1320156678508191744 2020-10-25 08:14:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Peoples_Pundit That's 4 points behind St. Pete polls latest that had Biden eking it out by 1 or 2.

1320124509274492929 2020-10-25 06:06:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden The excitement is palpable for Trump. I genuinely believe any loss is illegitimate. It has to have been faked or stolen. I mean, they couldn't even manufacture a Frank Luntz anti-Trump focus group after the last debate. Even the black woman is like "yeah, I'm for Trump now."

The magistrate facilitates this through various degrees of protection. God sees to it the enemies of the Church are punished.
1320115088792162311 2020-10-25 05:28:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks I don't think so. The judiciary Trump has appointed will protect Churches and our private space. Ultimately, our private space will flourish over theirs and we will conquer. Have Faith: We have the Truth on our side.

1320114094809153536 2020-10-25 05:25:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks Perhaps, but I think the GOP has the opportunity to come up with a stable system out of this over the coming decade, if Trump wins the White House. As long the government allows good behavior to be rewarded and the bad punished, it will work to some degree.
1320113331856879617 2020-10-25 05:21:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> No conservative is looking to impose some kind of Puritanical theocracy anymore. We're at the point where the left's entire argument is conspiratorial and "no fun allowed."
1320113100511694853 2020-10-25 05:21:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The one thing that might negate the hypothesis that we are inevitably drifting farther left is that the left has entirely lost the plot. They're supposed to be the party of fun and good times: Sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Now they're the party of decency and depression.

Dems need either Pitt to show up in force for Democrats or the Wyoming Valley as well. There isn't as much juice to squeeze out of Montgomery or Chester: Those people vote anyway.
1320109836500164609 2020-10-25 05:08:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Maiorianus @thehangingchads Oh, I'd still bet on a Biden win in Virginia. Just that Virginia isn't likely to be quite the blowout we imagined it if Trump does attract a lot of backwoods rural voters that haven't voted in a long time like we suspect he is doing.
1320109084977385473 2020-10-25 05:05:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Bucks County might....buck the trend, though.
1320108673163808768 2020-10-25 05:03:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @1920Thomas @GOP I only speak the truth. I think the American people are more sick of your bald-faced lies and the corruption of our ruling class. They will not vote for the candidate of Wall Street: Joe Biden.
1320108428367482881 2020-10-25 05:02:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Maiorianus @thehangingchads The reason Trump won the election in 2016 was that he squeezed out a lot of dispirited rural White voters. There are still enough of these in Virginia to win the state if their turnout significantly outpaces Blacks and the NoVA area.
1320107872206917633 2020-10-25 05:00:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law I prefer the petty graft of Dick Nixon over the Orwellian schemes of modern spy agencies.

1320103109100699648 2020-10-25 04:41:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @horatio__92 Meaning that, of the people that didn't vote in Nevada in 2016 (a lot of people might have voted in other states), it's likely Trump is only losing by 2K or so and he has been gaining in this category everyday.
1320102044137607168 2020-10-25 04:37:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Republicans are less than 2000 votes behind in "Did not votes" in 2016 in Nevada.  https://t.co/1K1odDccwC

They've been that way even in the days of the Gallup gold standard. That's why they underestimated the size of Reagan's 80 win.
1320100738245251075 2020-10-25 04:31:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 @MitchMichaels8 @Rasmussen How many people have "already voted" according to that Rasmussen poll. I can guarantee you it's too many.  Also, the debate was two days ago. No way that can factor into national polling yet.

1320098421370458112 2020-10-25 04:22:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @powerkekt @realikamusume Right now it's at 67K vs 72K in 2016. So, it will have more votes, but 100K votes is nothing in Texas and Trump's margin there was a whopping 600 votes. Not exactly relevant to overall turnout. Need to keep an eye on the big counties and the sum total of the rest.
1320097651380178945 2020-10-25 04:19:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @powerkekt However, this will probably hold true within a state. Meaning, Dallas County likely has a lot of Republicans that look like Democrats around them and Cumberland County, Maryland has a lot of Democrats that look like Republicans around them.
1320097401391271938 2020-10-25 04:18:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @powerkekt The one caveat here is that I suspect TargetSmart overestimate party affiliation in party strongholds, but this is a two way street between Dem and Rep strongholds.  Meaning, a lot of Republicans are modeled Democrats in a state like Maryland and visa versa in a place like Texas.
1320096869247311877 2020-10-25 04:16:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @powerkekt Seriously: Collin County was one of Trump's biggest counties and it's at 83% turnout. Dallas? 67, below average. Travis is above average at 75 and Harris at 71, but they need big margins from Dallas to even make a dent. They will not get them. Period.
1320094982754140160 2020-10-25 04:09:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @realikamusume I just want to rebuke the Evangelical elite.   Al Mohler is voting Trump last I heard, though. I think he's far more representative of the average clergyman and former NeverTrump pew sitter than these Twitter seminary profs.
1320094511989727234 2020-10-25 04:07:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @powerkekt @realikamusume This analysis is terrible because the entire premise is wrong: We are not seeing turnout increase in Democrat areas. Not even in Texas. He also fails to note a much larger percentage of the vote is in than 2018 at this time. He's coping hard because he knows this is a disaster.
1320094212768079874 2020-10-25 04:06:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @realikamusume Colorado overall is 30% Hispanic, I believe.
1320093752074133504 2020-10-25 04:04:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Evangelicals in the South and West, but they've just been overwhelmed in recent years. I do think the religious right Evangelicals might vote 90-10 Trump on 27% turnout (meaning 27% of all votes are Evangelicals).
1320093328344551424 2020-10-25 04:02:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> In order for the polls to have been right about how much the early vote would break against Trump, TargetSmart's "modeled Republican" would have to be at least 25% disloyal to Trump and Trump couldn't pick up a single unaffiliated or Democrat. Color me skeptical.
1320092813778968581 2020-10-25 04:00:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Colorado is all mail in. It's a bit different.

1320091314445307906 2020-10-25 03:54:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @nossgiu Yes, he votes for Trump's nominees and occasionally for something we approve of, but NEVER was it the deciding vote. Most it did was prevent Pence from having to break a tie.
1320091129954652162 2020-10-25 03:53:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @nossgiu I still see people fooled by this guy on the "populist" right and it, quite frankly, leads me to think they're just political morons. There is not one vote Manchin has cast the deciding vote in our favor. Not a single one in his entire Senate career.
1320090476469432320 2020-10-25 03:51:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume It's even better when you look at how abysmal turnout in Black districts is. I still think Biden will win it, but it will not be the blowout a lot of you guys think.
1320090280989761537 2020-10-25 03:50:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @nossgiu Because he lied about opposing OCare and then again about working with Trump in 2018 and the GOP nominated a Cruz guy. Should have went with Evan Jenkins since he is personally popular like Manchin is.
1320089923907653634 2020-10-25 03:48:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @nossgiu She's not crazy liberal, but she's a loyal D vote on big votes like this and she did just direct her Judiciary colleagues to boycott the hearing to attempt a delay.  She's also likely to be challenged from her right again.
1320089305923129347 2020-10-25 03:46:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @nossgiu Feinstein? LMAO. Manchin, maybe, but like I keep saying with that snake: He's never there when you actually need him.
1320089001953579008 2020-10-25 03:45:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright @KingFrenly She'll have a primary challenger anyway. She hasn't run a race where she hasn't.
1320088176350945280 2020-10-25 03:42:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @nossgiu It isn't in her hands. She has nearly lost it in every race she has run, including to the Democrat in 2004 and she better be thankful the Democrats chose to vote for her over their own candidate in 2010.
1320087815766577155 2020-10-25 03:40:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu @BrianSh86084519 I think Sasse genuinely has a tortured conscious as well, but that's just because he's a weak-willed snake.   Murkowski isn't even really NeverTrump. She's just a liberal in general and has been from the start.
1320087480545255425 2020-10-25 03:39:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 She has also yet to receive a majority of the vote in any of her re-election campaigns (including her initial election after he daddy gave her the job).
1320087301830152194 2020-10-25 03:38:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 She should do it anyway. I'll never forgive her for her sore-loser write in run in 2010.
1320086488604958722 2020-10-25 03:35:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We've managed to whip Murkowski to being a tolerable Senator. This is....not what I would expect.
1320085738873065473 2020-10-25 03:32:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I think the post-election received date will get overturned. However, my understanding is the PA statute doesn't require the mail in ballot to have a matching signature. That's a problem for team GOP legally.
1320085298961932291 2020-10-25 03:30:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat Most of them don't say anything, but I mean someone like Saagar should vote for Trump, even if reluctantly, if you believe his public persona.
1320085048968839168 2020-10-25 03:29:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Only place it isn't holding is PA, but we all know PA GOP is boycotting mail ins. They still don't have enough requests out to win the state unless Biden supporters show up in force on election day.
1320084235810648072 2020-10-25 03:26:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I just know turnout is abysmal in Black jurisdictions right now and slightly behind pace in Fairfax. Up in rurals.
1320084045112410114 2020-10-25 03:25:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat You can't trust what any of these people say publicly. Some of them are more forthright than others, but the incentives for them are all out of whack. The media has made big money from Trump and they probably don't expect that to really change in Term 2.
1320083665574154241 2020-10-25 03:24:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I thought the registration trend in VA was slightly Trump positive. Don't know, though.
1320083243270610945 2020-10-25 03:22:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat It wouldn't surprise me if secretly Krystal is voting Trump and Saagar is voting Biden and they don't even know they're playing each other.   Also, he clearly wants in her pants.
1320082294359482369 2020-10-25 03:18:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Republicans trust Trump so much they have changed their voting patterns because of his word, but they're going to vote for Biden because mean tweet. Covid!
1320080455245434881 2020-10-25 03:11:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 @SelimSeesYou How can they possibly express their platform in terms of joy at this point? We're at the point where they have basically everything they ever wanted. Their platform can only be expressed as bitter resentment conservatives still exist.
1320078716832223233 2020-10-25 03:04:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pseudophilo There's a strong argument to be made that you should attempt to stay in communion with a backsliding group until they force you out, so I don't begrudge people who have stayed thus far. However, when they force you to accept sin in your diocese, they have crossed a line.
1320078345405632514 2020-10-25 03:02:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TraderNickPA @JackPosobiec The clip above is from the earlier rally in Bucks.
1320077814511620096 2020-10-25 03:00:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou How can they be happy when Trump has genocided 220 million people with covid? And another tens of millions of Latino refugees and Blacks?
1320077040448655362 2020-10-25 02:57:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 I mean, people think he has those locked up. They're probably not wrong. He needs to keep all of the rust belt anyway, though, particularly PA. I think he has already hit diminishing returns there, though.
1320076269510447106 2020-10-25 02:54:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Will do, brother.  Some people have very strange views.
1320075825660743682 2020-10-25 02:52:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There are definitely more people at the Wilkes-Barre rally for Bon Jovi than for Biden.
1320074249281875969 2020-10-25 02:46:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy How do you even reason with such people? What incentive would he even have to do that?  With Black people, you can at least ascribe Trump a cynical motive.
1320073485813714944 2020-10-25 02:43:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dude blocked me lmao  https://t.co/MkIWYek6zW
1320073266065821697 2020-10-25 02:42:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @trevorm8 @AirBossUT5 I'm not really sure where the Blacks live in Florida. We don't need Broward, Orange, or even much in Miami-Dade anyway.
1320071884030070784 2020-10-25 02:37:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> As a matter of ecclesiology, I have thought that it may only be appropriate to separate from a communion when they excommunicate the orthodox. TEC has officially stepped over that line now.
1320069277278474247 2020-10-25 02:26:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacksonPackson1 @AirBossUT5 Still a good sign because Republicans are expected to win election day by even more.
1320068507443335168 2020-10-25 02:23:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Chronolxgical @AirBossUT5 If Trump gets 40% in Miami Dade, it's ogre.
1320068247329345537 2020-10-25 02:22:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 Umm...Miami Dade?
1320068012112752646 2020-10-25 02:21:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I don’t understand how you can seriously defend people like this having any say in how we run the government.
1320066027095527425 2020-10-25 02:14:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis People seem to have forgotten in the industrial age that people have arbitrary wills.
1320065393789194240 2020-10-25 02:11:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It can get worse!
1320064785824796673 2020-10-25 02:09:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nived56 He did say that, though.
1320063690440323072 2020-10-25 02:04:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> On one side of his mouth, he speaks of unity. On the other he speaks of how red states are the cause of coronavirus. Trump's message might be "divisive," but it's consistent.
1320063463025238017 2020-10-25 02:03:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I honestly don't think the "deplorables" thing really hurt Clinton much in the end run because her campaign theme didn't really conflict with it.  Voters like hearing a consistent narrative. Biden's narrative is much less consistent than Hillary's was.
1320059850982887424 2020-10-25 01:49:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NickJFuentes I like parliamentary style debate. It’s fun.
1320059467610886144 2020-10-25 01:47:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CelticRoman8 Too early really. I think it will end up being closer than I thought initially. I enjoy being pleasantly surprised, though.
1320057352763080704 2020-10-25 01:39:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CelticRoman8 The typical “suburban women hate Trump!” story.
1320057220814544896 2020-10-25 01:39:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago @JackPosobiec If Trump wins Bucks County, it’s ogre.
1320057027910131712 2020-10-25 01:38:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Funny thing is that more Evangelicals will vote for Trump than any other President in history anyway.
1320056510328823808 2020-10-25 01:36:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Several of these name are pretty cool IMO.
1320056322897883137 2020-10-25 01:35:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Even doomer Girdusky understands basic math here.
1320053722542755842 2020-10-25 01:25:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law @realDonaldTrump These people talk to their friends and convince them to vote Trump. Those are real votes from real people.
1320053483001860096 2020-10-25 01:24:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 56% of people according to Gallup say so. I thought we believed the polls?
1320051582466142211 2020-10-25 01:16:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "I'll be the President for the chumps too!"   What a unifying vision for the country. Truly inspiring.
1320051355202080774 2020-10-25 01:15:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JackPosobiec This is Bucks County.
1320051027496865792 2020-10-25 01:14:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BorealReinhard I actually think it will look most similar to 2004 at the end of the day in terms of part affiliation.   You can tell there's big response bias by the "already voted" category that gives Joe more than his entire edge in these polls. Every single poll "already voted" is too high.
1320050447919579138 2020-10-25 01:12:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ozbollox88 Trying to find stuff, but late deciders have broken for the Republican in basically every election since 2004. Even in like 2008 this was the case. I think a part of it is that undecideds are like two-thirds just "shy Torys."
1320049705083088899 2020-10-25 01:09:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BorealReinhard I believe these people don’t understand the electorate at all.
1320047810809659392 2020-10-25 01:01:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed No. I love the mood here:  https://t.co/lcmpnseNiw
1320047405912498176 2020-10-25 01:00:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical If Gallup is anywhere near right about the gap in voting intention between Republicans and Democrats (and this is repeated across polls) and it's 4:1 on election day? We're looking at a plurality Republican electorate.
1320046997626380288 2020-10-25 00:58:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical I think we might be looking at the most Republican electorate since the New Deal. When you just take everything together, it just seems we're looking at a large increase of Republicans voting.
1320046432200556544 2020-10-25 00:56:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 2020 is the best year ever and you're not going to convince me otherwise.
1320045867555061761 2020-10-25 00:53:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If there's a turnout surge, it's going to come from rural Republicans. This is why I'm bullish on Minnesota, where there's a lot of turnout to juice in the rurals.
1320045286291628033 2020-10-25 00:51:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep I think Rush isn’t verified because he thought the process was BS.
1320045068087152647 2020-10-25 00:50:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WhateverUchoose I think third parties will get like 3% this time: A more typical share. Popular Vote would be close: Would depend on exactly how many people show up in California.
1320041687658471424 2020-10-25 00:37:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago Satan one would presume.
1320040383586439169 2020-10-25 00:32:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago A bit difficult to gauge that question. We’re at 37% of the vote from the 2016 election so far, but about 20% of them didn’t vote at all (an average number).
1320039994015219713 2020-10-25 00:30:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Republicans have won Election Day voting in every election since early voting was a thing and now we have an election where a disproportionate number of them claim to be waiting until Election Day. Dems better pray they have enough votes banked.
1320037607385014273 2020-10-25 00:21:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wandlearner Ohio has always been a must win for Republicans. I don’t think any Republican has ever won the White House without Ohio.
1320036863030288385 2020-10-25 00:18:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu @bestgtor88 It was robbed for sure.
1320036386179788803 2020-10-25 00:16:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Important for voters by mail!
1320036122404192256 2020-10-25 00:15:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Iowa voted for Ford in 1976, but Ohio did not.
1320035725694349314 2020-10-25 00:13:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The last time Iowa and Ohio voted for a losing Republican was 1960.
1320035240610496512 2020-10-25 00:11:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 Every roughneck I’ve ever known is so far to the right they make me blush.
1320035035114840064 2020-10-25 00:10:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 Last election with a comparable turnout was 1960 at 62.8%.
1320034840151031811 2020-10-25 00:10:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 83.3% of registered voters. 62.5% of eligible voters. Unprecedented in a modern election.
1320033837339058183 2020-10-25 00:06:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If 150 million votes end up being cast, I think Trump will get at least 72 million of them.
1320033555704139779 2020-10-25 00:04:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dems are really banking they banked enough swing votes early Biden’s oil industry gaffe and the laptop won’t hurt him. They’re only fooling themselves.
1320033087540002817 2020-10-25 00:03:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @realikamusume Biden is running them here too. A lot. I’ve heard this is because of the two super red counties in PA in the DC market. I’m like: LMAO
1320032536895082496 2020-10-25 00:00:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @loxotic8 @realikamusume We have body armor and everyone in the House is armed with enough ammo. Would rather be safe than sorry.
1320032141527420934 2020-10-24 23:59:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly Wish he voted on Election Day. Then again, this gives him more time to hit the Rust Belt hard.
1320031685195554816 2020-10-24 23:57:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume The gun show in late November here is going to be insane if Biden wins.  I’m significantly less concerned about civil unrest if Trump wins than I was a month ago, to be honest. I think the key Dems have mentally accepted their defeat even if they don’t admit it.
1320023920083410944 2020-10-24 23:26:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation @rudnicknoah I’m too in the weeds right now lol
1320023847840718848 2020-10-24 23:26:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation @rudnicknoah Actually, if Gallup is right that 28% of Republicans wanted to vote early, and early voting stopped today, we’re looking at like 70-80 million Republican votes overall. Which seems like...a lot. Though, I enjoy being pleasantly surprised.
1320023348970246149 2020-10-24 23:24:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation @rudnicknoah I’m just comparing them to polled voting intention...which, apparently, were ridiculously wrong.   Some people are looking at the D vs R numbers and completely forgetting that Republicans self-reported that they didn’t want to vote early disproportionately.

1319864235250286592 2020-10-24 12:52:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The head of the executive branch is responsible for policy making. If the people making policy on behalf of the office he lawfully occupies defy him, they should be subject to immediate dismissal. Period. End of story.
1319861819683594243 2020-10-24 12:42:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @CottoGottfried The whole thread and he never once considered that more of the vote is in than in 2018. He also didn’t consider what happened in the Gubernatorial Election.
1319861364848984066 2020-10-24 12:40:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee I’m still waiting for the other shoe to drop. It’s pretty clear we’ve got him dead to rights, but people need to KNOW.
1319860666870759424 2020-10-24 12:37:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou These are the people that went from “only the Sith deal in absolutes” 15 years ago to being unable to understand how margins work.
1319859617665568769 2020-10-24 12:33:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @horatio__92 @BeigeShiba Yeah, it really did kind of turn in the latter half of the main quest line into something far less interesting.
1319853055685382144 2020-10-24 12:07:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba It was enjoyable, but I wouldn’t spend too much money on it.
1319851163727126528 2020-10-24 12:00:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This will be particularly bad in Pennsylvania. Polls will show Trump down by 5 or so in the closing days, but the Election Day vote will swamp the Democrats in the state.
1319850620858388480 2020-10-24 11:58:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Any poll that controls for those who have "already voted" will tighten significantly. The problem is that they will now overcorrect and underestimate both the margin of the election day Trump win and the size of the Election Day vote.
1319850273846808577 2020-10-24 11:56:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jpoliticologist I think we're going to see poll tightening based on the early vote for this reason, but it's going to tighten by overcorrecting for turnout and going to underestimate the Election Day turnout we are going to get.
1319848095031742470 2020-10-24 11:48:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Guys, 70.4% of Democrats have already voted in Florida according to the polls. Please ignore that the present return rate is only 60%.
1319847279688359942 2020-10-24 11:44:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This includes 70.4% of Democrats. 70.4!
1319847063790800897 2020-10-24 11:43:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Is a fifth of the vote really in the mail right now? Seems doubtful.
1319846984954597376 2020-10-24 11:43:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Another poll, another crazy number of people who "already voted" that simply doesn't make sense.  According to St. Pete Polls, 60.3% of people have already voted in the State of Florida. Problem: Only 49.8% of the number of ballots cast in 2016 have been returned.
1319842024120635393 2020-10-24 11:23:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Can't you just feel the Joementum?
1319841770834808834 2020-10-24 11:22:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Hello, I'd like to report some "foreign election interference."
1319840730765021184 2020-10-24 11:18:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @CottoGottfried TargetSmart's dude was trying to argue Dems actually are ahead of where they were in 2018 in the Early vote. Ignoring that there are way more votes in, so it doesn't matter.
1319840177523666944 2020-10-24 11:16:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wandlearner @razibkhan That's because you have two sides that will head after you. The Trumpian "he's going to pull it off for sure!" clan and the election mafia that claims anything where Texas isn't blue must be a Russian psyop.
1319836972836323328 2020-10-24 11:03:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump: The air in India is filthy.  Media: He insulted India!  Indians: Yeah, it's pretty filthy here.
1319836339886526466 2020-10-24 11:01:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It should also be noted turnout isn't exactly stellar among 30-39 year old. I expect this is because younger Republicans are all waiting for Election Day.   Guys, there's going to be a crazy number of Republicans voting on Election Day. It's going to be nuts. Unprecedented.
1319835034866622464 2020-10-24 10:56:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 @JayFiveK @wasphyxiation @SelimSeesYou @HbdNrx This is vaguely possible if he gets 20% of the overall Black male rust belt vote like Bush got and a lot of them vote early. Just extremely unlikely I'd venture.
1319833292670226434 2020-10-24 10:49:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @SelimSeesYou If Trump loses, it will be because of a relatively large loss among Independent voters in the swing states. It will not be because of a Democratic surge. If anything, we're looking at the most Republican Presidential Electorate since 2004.
1319831994876952576 2020-10-24 10:44:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot After the debate last night? 100%, no doubt.
1319831746985283591 2020-10-24 10:43:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @wasphyxiation @SelimSeesYou @HbdNrx That's my theory on it as well. Which will lead to a 1972 like scenario where the youth vote is both depressed and more Republican than expected. I think this is also what's happening among AAs to a certain extent as well.
1319831233459871745 2020-10-24 10:41:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @wasphyxiation @SelimSeesYou @HbdNrx Trump will win nearly every demo that votes on election day except Blacks. Yes, that includes young people and Latinos who vote on Election Day. Question is how many people vote on Election Day.
1319827046403592192 2020-10-24 10:24:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I just don't even see what they're seeing. In public district polling (which is much more scant than it used to be pre-2010 when they tried to hide the impending GOP wave over OCare), Trump is doing totally fine compared to 2016.
1319826686305837058 2020-10-24 10:22:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Can someone teach political analysts about the law of diminishing return and hard barriers? Like, there's only so many potential people in the universe of voters.
1319825549565612032 2020-10-24 10:18:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Dems are presenting early vote data completely out of the context of a national surge of early vote compared to 2016. The youth vote is still well below average nationally. That WILL increase, but no sign it will be over the average of 17-18% overall like their fake polls say
1319825041023008769 2020-10-24 10:16:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation @SelimSeesYou @HbdNrx ...Nationally, since 2004, the youth vote is typically 17-18% of the vote. Including 2016. 2000 it was 15%. If I had to bet, right now we're looking at national youth vote at 15-16%. 18% is definitely still possible with election day turnout, but seems unlikely.
1319824757110546435 2020-10-24 10:15:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation @SelimSeesYou @HbdNrx Thank you  Note on this: They're comparing incomparables. The early/mail vote is a larger percentage of the total vote this year. Thus, it's actually harder for the youth to boost their turnout on election day like they usually do from the days of early voting....
1319822811628797953 2020-10-24 10:07:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing @AbdiPopulist Someone was telling me I should trust Fairfax County and vote early. Me:  https://t.co/by2SkBKl2m
1319821647860420609 2020-10-24 10:02:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Bellwether Suburban County info: Clark County, WA. This is a county that is typically very close to the national total vote and it appears to be swinging for Trump. Modeled Republicans are beating Modeled Democrats by ~4,400 did not votes as of right now.  https://t.co/MqVritzKZv
1319817965798367232 2020-10-24 09:48:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> As you can see below: The vast majority of "Did not votes" are not truly new voters. They are either movers or infrequent voters for the most part. Some of them are new since 2016 and voted in 2018, but that's not a large cross section. This is not a turnout surge in other words.  https://t.co/bib0pZfB4M

1319814014764044289 2020-10-24 09:32:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nossgiu I know, but this behooves traditional political analysis. People call themselves all kinds of things and then have fundamentally opposed opinions. For instance, this gay man's opinion, despite his "left wing" politics, is almost reactionary on a social level in a certain sense.
1319812726064119808 2020-10-24 09:27:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Most people's political views are incredibly bizarre when you get down to it.
1319811901463924737 2020-10-24 09:24:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I once had a gay man tell me he thought his role in life was to support straight people having more kids and that was why he was a Democratic Socialist. Truly odd individual on a number of levels.
1319811438681182209 2020-10-24 09:22:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiah_crawley @AStratelates I have significant other problems with this. The simple fact of the matter is that computers are not as reliable as pen and paper and never will be. There's always a backdoor. There's always a hack. It just requires time and investment and there's a lot of money in a Prez race.
1319809272843296768 2020-10-24 09:13:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates Perhaps there are ways to do this with standard mail, which is what we are talking about, but doing so would be ridiculously expensive to implement. KISS: Show up in person, prove who you are, sign your name, drop a vote in a box.
1319806956924768256 2020-10-24 09:04:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @AirBossUT5 Nebraska is one of the most reliably Republican states in the Union and always has been aside from their law affair with William Jennings Bryan (understandable for farmers). Nebraska 2 has some cringe metro urbanites, though.
1319805162505064448 2020-10-24 08:57:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 Would be embarrassing if Joe gets 270 from NE-2 and he didn't even show.
1319802130220371968 2020-10-24 08:45:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The problem with mail in voting is there no way to completely resolve election security with a secret ballot. In person voting is the only way to resolve this issue.
1319801476001239041 2020-10-24 08:42:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> For reference, an average of 20% of voters in any Presidential election didn’t vote in the last one.
1319801065311817728 2020-10-24 08:41:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> For TargetSmart data, it should be noted that “did not votes” just mean they didn’t vote in that state in the last election. Perfectly reasonable to assume a lot of them have just moved. Probably how 33.6% of them are super/frequent voters.
1319797661969616896 2020-10-24 08:27:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads They’re probably embarrassed by @AOC

1319791785263173632 2020-10-24 08:04:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I've been waiting for TargetSmart to update to do my daily turnout report since they've been update two times in recent days. Haven't done a second one yet and I know they're behind. If they haven't dumped it by 9, I'm just going to do it anyway.

1319772098571739136 2020-10-24 06:46:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is my problem right now: In order for Dems to win, the polls have to be wrong that they're all voting by mail. In order for them to lose, the polls are just wrong period.
1319771842358480898 2020-10-24 06:45:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All this spin from thee Dem camp about the early vote: Look, are the polls right and there's supposed to be 60 million banked Dem votes going into election day or are they wrong? Because Republicans WILL win the election day vote. The only question is how much.
1319770707224657920 2020-10-24 06:40:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BladesOfChaos70 @SelimSeesYou All this is subject: We don't know who these people are voting for, etc., but Tom is really trying to spin something bad for Dems into something recoverable. Is it recoverable? It ain't over until the fat lady sings, as the saying goes, but they'll need to change trends.
1319770388356866048 2020-10-24 06:39:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BladesOfChaos70 @SelimSeesYou It's actually *harder* for the youth to increase their turnout on Election Day simply because of the way math works. So far, they're 10.5% of 5.7 million. To match 2016, they need another 250K votes if no one else voted. Where are those people?
1319769827465101316 2020-10-24 06:37:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BladesOfChaos70 @SelimSeesYou Wow. That is some terrible analysis. He doesn't seem to be taking into any account that we're supposed to be seeing (according to every data point available): A larger Dem turnout comparatively in the Early Vote. Much more of the population overall has voted: where are the youth?
1319768039143989251 2020-10-24 06:29:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Maine 2, yes. So many Massholes in Maine 1 because of Covid, sadly.

1319766714935054339 2020-10-24 06:24:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 I don't think they have as many requests out as they need. If they get 85% return rate, they're still only at 2.25 Million in mail ins. Add about a million in early votes, we're at 3.25 million. They're going to need ED voters or heavy NPA break: Trump will likely break 5 million
1319765420677730304 2020-10-24 06:19:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Election Day NPAs are likely going to favor Trump. IPEV are likely fairly even and mail ins are probably breaking even. There's so much gas left in the tank in Florida for Trump among super voting Republicans and IP NPAs.
1319762140744585218 2020-10-24 06:06:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hockyluv21 @LuisBobby3 @RedEaglePatriot Immigration is neither good nor bad as an overall idea. There are definite negatives to it: A society must have a strong culture to absorb new blood without losing its identity. Problem is we have mass immigration of highly dissimilar people at a historical cultural weak point.
1319760903462682625 2020-10-24 06:01:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @RedEaglePatriot I fear it might lead Republicans to get a bit complacent on it. Mass immigration is definitely a net loss for the GOP, it's just not the immediate disaster doomers like Coulter and Mickey Kaus think. It won't take hold for several more cycles.
1319759906396868608 2020-10-24 05:57:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot With Tejanos trending back red, it's going to take a lot of suburban flips for Texas to trend blue, which is bad news nationally. Very Bad News.

Trump won by 45K. If GOP returns their ballots or votes on Election Day (still 20% of the vote, maybe more this year), Trump is in ok shape right now.

1319751784701845504 2020-10-24 05:25:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law He clearly doesn't understand how margins work. Like, you can't get an idea of what the overall Central PA T margin is going to be with a random sample of statewide voters. This is becoming a bigger problem as we see a larger cultural divide between the metros and the country.

My grandmother (his wife) was a devout Catholic from Wilkes-Barre, but shortly before she passed she was angry at Trump over trannies in the military. Like, I know you didn't grow up thinking that way, grandma.
1319729102358781955 2020-10-24 03:55:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dude, if this comes down to 10,000 votes in PA like this, it's not going to be pretty.
1319728210821730304 2020-10-24 03:51:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The other one voted for Barry Goldwater in his first election and is currently terrified at the prospect of a Biden win.
1319727975072452609 2020-10-24 03:50:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> My grandfather from Scranton probably would have voted for Joe Biden and say it was because of Amtrak. And he never cast a vote for a Republican and his whole life, but that's a separate story.

1319719102617948166 2020-10-24 03:15:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Honestly, I’m going to be a bit concerned if Florida is only 2 points Trump at the end of the day. Not enough to believe he’ll lose, but 3-4 is where we’re going to see a big night for Republicans across the board.
1319715571123036161 2020-10-24 03:01:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @billsretpal @lambeth981 Same. This is all with the caveat we don't know who these people are voting for.

1319711604242587648 2020-10-24 02:45:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I think Trump will carry Michigan, but I don't think it's by carrying 40% of AAs. That's territory where he's nearly carrying Wayne County and Flint once you incorporate the White margins.

1319707468797218821 2020-10-24 02:29:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Hot take: I don't think the Dem message on healthcare is really going to resonate going into election day this time. We've had 3 years of decreasing healthcare premiums under Trump and everyone promises to protect pre-existing conditions.
1319707049945681923 2020-10-24 02:27:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis @KingBroly @Peoples_Pundit She has a better chance than people think. I think even Baris is underestimating her chances. If healthcare is off the table when the swing Trump voters actually cast the ballot, she'll probably pull it off IMO.
1319706613624819712 2020-10-24 02:25:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rrawa9857 @RedEaglePatriot PA is abysmal for Democrats unless they can get more requests in by Tuesday night next week. The others are harder to determine, but the trends aren't good.
1319706337790525440 2020-10-24 02:24:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 You should be able to do a standard RT when you enter no text in your quote.
1319705914916655109 2020-10-24 02:23:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly @Peoples_Pundit Seems unlikely, but the poll is a good sign for both. It does partially depend on turnout who runs ahead of who, I just don't see the McSally coalition showing up in greater numbers than the Trump coalition.
1319704701605208072 2020-10-24 02:18:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago I agree, but I think Reagan's putting even more pressure to amp up the military, and then Gorbachev attempting to reverse course way too late did hasten the fall. I'm just saying that's the only recent term you can argue was as much of a success as Trump's.
1319703810223296518 2020-10-24 02:14:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago This is the most successful Presidential term in a long time. At least since Reagan II setup the demolition of the USSR. I think it's even better than that considering other events, but I may be biased.
1319703109191536642 2020-10-24 02:11:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> USMCA. Hundreds of miles of border fencing. Legal immigration decreasing. Fastest economic recovery in history. Wages up for the first time in decades. What more can you ask for?
1319702569866960896 2020-10-24 02:09:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "Trump has no significant foreign policy successes!"  Peace in the Middle East seems pretty big to me. The Custodians of Mecca are going to recognize Israel. That seems like a Big Deal to me.

1319701400121757696 2020-10-24 02:05:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @lambeth981 The numbers we are seeing in early voting simply do not match the numbers we are expecting to see according to the polls. This is across the board in every state. Turnout in PA among Dems is looking abysmal. Youth and AA turnout is looking down. No excitement for Biden at all.

There was a time in the not too distant past where the only people who didn't vote on election day had a strong reason. Turnout hasn't really ballooned since.
1319700028672409600 2020-10-24 01:59:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheRealKDuff @j_stonian @RedEaglePatriot I don't know, I like giving them false hope and then crushing their dreams.
1319698163700273152 2020-10-24 01:52:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The corporate media is an enemy to all right-thinking, honest people. If you EVER want to have an election where we debate issues in an open and honest manner, you have to reject their propagandistic lies.
1319697581958717445 2020-10-24 01:49:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis I actually used to prefer CNN over FNC for election night coverage. CNN is just way too biased now to even have fun, though. Think I'm going to be following Baris unless I'm at a big party.

It's a joke. Also consider it's looking like 10% crossover Dems votes in PA.   If the GOP shows up on election day in force, it's going to be ugly.
1319695355370418179 2020-10-24 01:41:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 @realikamusume Also, the undecideds disproportionately purport to be conservative and moderate Indies that tend to agree with Trump on the issues.
1319695080341602304 2020-10-24 01:40:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 @realikamusume It's all good news from here on out for Trump. The debate was good news. The economy will be good news. Biden will be plagued with this scandal, which is getting traction among swing voters despite what cynical pundits think.

1319682552194600961 2020-10-24 00:50:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago Only 18.2% of voters in Hennepin so far didn't vote in 2016 (20% is totally normal). Overall, DNVs are breaking significantly for Dems in MN, but turnout is slowing and I think GOP is waiting to vote on election day.

1319666175098441728 2020-10-23 23:45:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis They also overestimate immigration as an important issue. People agree with them on immigration, and it's a big issue in GOP primaries, but it's like 10-15% among the general electorate. You can't run a campaign purely on "kick out all the Mexicans" in PA.

1319665206545555464 2020-10-23 23:41:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis These people act like Trump is endorsing amnesty by going like "well, why didn't you do it?"   This actually depresses support for amnesty itself: Shows even its supporters know it's wrong or don't care on some level.

1319664136310185986 2020-10-23 23:37:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads They did already immediately after the debate.
1319664014474039296 2020-10-23 23:36:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Mickey here apparently doesn't understand good politics. It's perfectly reasonable to drive down opposition turnout by questioning their creds on their platform.   What else do you expect from the doomer Coulter crowd, though?
1319661494888517640 2020-10-23 23:26:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @ProudColonizer Nevada is going to be really weird this year with the way their economy is going.
1319661264596029451 2020-10-23 23:25:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @ProudColonizer New Hampshire, and, to a lesser extent, Maine are decided by last minute independent swing voters. Definitely possible for weird stuff to happen there.
1319660645625827329 2020-10-23 23:23:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> LMAO
1319660212643598336 2020-10-23 23:21:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW Strong disagree. I don't think Trump is getting these minorities from the ridiculous amount pandering. He's getting a higher percentage because of lower turnout, maybe a little of the First Step Act, and because the economy is working for them. A rising tide lifts all boats.
1319659095041990657 2020-10-23 23:17:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon Well, I think this poll is garbage. It has Trump running even among Blacks. The rest is believable, but that? LMAO.
1319658888812204033 2020-10-23 23:16:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> FYI, I think this poll is garbage. It has Trump and Biden basically tied among Blacks.
1319657730819457024 2020-10-23 23:11:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Libs in the comments: Polls are only good when they agree with me.
1319656482523254792 2020-10-23 23:06:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Agreed. The dude, weed crowd in Colorado is just too strong.
1319654436491415553 2020-10-23 22:58:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Lighten up Virginia. Turnout is abysmal in Black dominated jurisdictions and up in rurals.
1319652835441569793 2020-10-23 22:52:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @pabloplato @realikamusume TargetSmart is producing two separate numbers for themselves and NBC. Odd.
1319652594072027137 2020-10-23 22:51:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Fox News Election Alert: Delaware too close to call.
1319650642525409280 2020-10-23 22:43:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lauraka09619649 @SelimSeesYou The most reliable voters are older college-educated conservatives, but I definitely think a lot of people in Trump's WWC base didn't turnout because of the doomerism. These people might call themselves moderates or conservatives, but they really tend to believe the same things.
1319649929992732674 2020-10-23 22:40:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Oblivion2elect1 @realikamusume @SelimSeesYou Yeah, there was a lot more juice to turnout in the GOP rurals compared to MSP in 2016. With the Iron Range flipping, it might not even be that close.
1319645698112000007 2020-10-23 22:23:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lauraka09619649 @SelimSeesYou Yeah, it really depends on who does the turning out, of course. At 100% turnout, I think that slightly favors Dems, but not as much as it would have 10, 15, 20 years ago. But 100% turnout isn't a thing.
1319643456982142976 2020-10-23 22:14:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LVB_19 @SelimSeesYou Turnout is way down in urban cores right now as well.
1319642668394291200 2020-10-23 22:11:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LVB_19 @SelimSeesYou It could always pick up, but I think we're heading for the lowest youth turnout since 2000.
1319642264696741888 2020-10-23 22:10:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Yeah, high turnout in rurals isn't good for Democrats. There aren't a bunch of hidden liberals in the backwoods of Wisconsin.
1319636103591268352 2020-10-23 21:45:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Their lead in the battlegrounds is about half of what it is nationally because of California.
1319507983567642624 2020-10-23 13:16:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK There’s a Senate race in New Mexico. Watch it randomly flip now.
1319507861177774080 2020-10-23 13:16:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK House Dems: Oh shit.
1319502942634971136 2020-10-23 12:56:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @CottoGottfried The Hunter scandal is reinforcing Trump’s whole narrative that he’s trying to sell. What’s reinforcing Biden’s narrative besides relentless media propaganda?
1319502461242167297 2020-10-23 12:54:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @CottoGottfried ...It’s just so obvious how biased the media is and how vitriolic his critics are. They act like there’s no legitimate reason you can like Trump and people just aren’t buying it.
1319502195268718593 2020-10-23 12:53:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @CottoGottfried This is exactly the kind of fundamentals I’m talking about. Fundamentally people agree with Trump and like his Presidency, but they’re trying to be “decent” and give some of his critics the benefit of the doubt. That doubt is disappearing over the course of the election...
1319500965012262912 2020-10-23 12:48:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @CottoGottfried Anything specifically, though? These focus groups are supposed to be “undecideds,” right?
1319499803110395904 2020-10-23 12:44:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @CottoGottfried People just don’t seem to get that voting is an act of arbitrary human will that can change at any moment. Much more important than who people tell you they voted for is the why they’re voting at all.
1319496129223020545 2020-10-23 12:29:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation Because this isn’t how political coalitions work and the pitch for the WWC is to continue policies have actually benefitted them in real tangible ways. Just looks what has happened in the rust belt. Some of these places have jobs for the first time in decades.
1319488982254837761 2020-10-23 12:01:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Pittsburgh is pretty vote rich.
1319488167892996096 2020-10-23 11:57:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Seriously.

1319486251871948800 2020-10-23 11:50:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @SelimSeesYou “I’ll be the President for all Americans...by force!”  Real unifying message from Biden.
1319485856445534208 2020-10-23 11:48:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Kane9015 @AirBossUT5 I think she’s more representative of her social group than people want to believe.

1319484739087118341 2020-10-23 11:44:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cummymonke Yeah, it’s looking pretty bad right now. Not all these requests are being returned. They don’t really have enough requests out in PA and they scared their voters from the Election Day polls.
1319484107110387712 2020-10-23 11:41:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BlackLodgeAgent @Cummymonke They’re not really prepared for it. Can be a real disaster for the Dems since they’re so unprepared it.
1319483208157794305 2020-10-23 11:38:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BlackLodgeAgent @Cummymonke They still need their requests in by Tuesday. They don’t even have enough request out for Democrats right now and not all requests will be returned.
1319482732691468289 2020-10-23 11:36:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sethjlevy NC shifted red. His prince going up across swing states.

1319478916197875713 2020-10-23 11:21:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Sir, please take that back, I think even your "hometown" of Scranton is going to vote against you now.   (I really wanna see Lackawanna turn red just to piss them off).
1319478612253413376 2020-10-23 11:19:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @realikamusume The only reasonable alternatives to fossil fuels they refuse to pursue. It's too much effort for a single 4 year administration, but the only real way to efficiently move beyond fossil fuels is nuclear. Massive wind and solar farms are horribly wasteful.
1319477751330594816 2020-10-23 11:16:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> A lot of politically active people don't get how these people can exist, but a lot of people just aren't politically active and they tend to waffle a lot in general.
1319476574584975360 2020-10-23 11:11:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is a good way to put it. The undecideds and third party vote parkers will come home. I don’t get how people think there’s no undecideds or soft support when the RCP average has 6% not voting Trump or Biden. Not that I buy the polls, but these people obviously exist.
1319475981493669890 2020-10-23 11:09:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton It’s against the norms of our democracy!
1319475217148841985 2020-10-23 11:06:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biden spent the time yelling “c’mon man.” His entire campaign is cynical lies. I’m really sick of it. Trump’s message isn’t fundamentally a cynical one.
1319473307524173825 2020-10-23 10:58:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I really want to end Frank Luntz and Nate Silver’s careers.
1319472615111692289 2020-10-23 10:56:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Doesn’t this just tell the story? Biden’s sitting here trying to run out the clock. It’s so cynical.
1319472027405864961 2020-10-23 10:53:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FlycatcherSilky This country is too big to let moral scares in left wing urban centers ruin the lives of ordinary people.
1319471243314319361 2020-10-23 10:50:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Legendary.
1319470248865792000 2020-10-23 10:46:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Seriously. These cynical commentators pretending this matter pretend like people are all ideologues. There’s real people with real jobs and real friends and family in these industries.
1319468813562355713 2020-10-23 10:40:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NewEra_05 There is no way Biden wins PA now. No way.
1319468224103186432 2020-10-23 10:38:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump won that debate. Period. End of story.
1319467698947051520 2020-10-23 10:36:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Systemic racism!
1319467485192663042 2020-10-23 10:35:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Yeah, I think he just lost PA. And those folks definitely haven’t voted yet.
1319466809465196545 2020-10-23 10:32:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Wait, did he grow up in Scranton or Delaware?
1319466045606907904 2020-10-23 10:29:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiah_crawley Go after the ACNA vote by promising to restore our properties!

1319463264259100672 2020-10-23 10:18:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Sick of everything negative for Democrats being called Russian disinfo. They really just want this to be a one party state with a fake opposition.
1319462557619453954 2020-10-23 10:16:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biden is known for telling the truth? Oh, c’mon. This guy has real nerve.

1319460765569527813 2020-10-23 10:08:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Lmao.
1319460727971893248 2020-10-23 10:08:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Wow. Trump calls the illegals dummies.

1319448487453392901 2020-10-23 09:20:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> More Americans oppose more lockdowns at this point. This is a winning point for Republicans.
1319447511300530185 2020-10-23 09:16:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Seriously, if we vote (assuming it’s not rigged) for Biden, apparently Americans suck. Do we really want to hide like this?

1319430683505426441 2020-10-23 08:09:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @17_canderson @AirBossUT5 78% of the Republicans who have voted so far voted in 2016.
1319427239109427212 2020-10-23 07:55:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I think it’s a combo of bad method and confirmation bias as well.
1319426279838535683 2020-10-23 07:51:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @JayFiveK He has the goods.
1319425818171478017 2020-10-23 07:50:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AKCdoghandler @RealAPolitics That’s why Kamala Harris is heading to Cleveland.
1319425470975397888 2020-10-23 07:48:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK He has such a knack for timing.
1319425083245473794 2020-10-23 07:47:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Offensive on all fronts!
1319424341919043589 2020-10-23 07:44:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CityBureaucrat Why you insult us splitters?
1319423801470242818 2020-10-23 07:42:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The reason the Hunter laptop story matters is because it reinforces Trump’s narrative: There are corrupt elites arrayed against the interests of the American people and the media is helping them do it.
1319423400629108741 2020-10-23 07:40:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Cummymonke Yeah, this is bigger than any emails of Hillary Clinton.
1319422229633994752 2020-10-23 07:35:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly Yes
1319418911734059014 2020-10-23 07:22:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I know people who were ridiculously hypocritical on the tapes. Really pissed me off.
1319417289524084736 2020-10-23 07:16:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tempustempus @SelimSeesYou Clearly they should turn to Haley!
1319417191830327296 2020-10-23 07:15:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume You’re supposed to read this as “Ohio is faltering” because Harris is going there for a rally where ten people will show up. Momentum!
1319415539278794753 2020-10-23 07:09:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume What a glorious future awaits.
1319414828948164609 2020-10-23 07:06:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tempustempus @SelimSeesYou He’ll be lucky to carry Indiana, his VP’s own home state! Tennessee is faltering!
1319414002401804294 2020-10-23 07:03:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tempustempus @SelimSeesYou “Why do you even want to stay on as President?”
1319413292448690176 2020-10-23 07:00:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Ted Cruz tried to run on the Pace Picante platform. Joe is going with Dunder-Mifflin, I guess.
1319411857241874433 2020-10-23 06:54:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK He promised number 3!
1319410421191815168 2020-10-23 06:48:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee Honestly it’s speculation on my part, but Henry McMaster was the first statewide elected official to endorse Trump and he was in charge of the anti-Haley/Sanford wing of the South Carolina GOP.
1319409338730020871 2020-10-23 06:44:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ProudColonizer She hasn’t got a prayer, IMO. If Trump wins, there’s even less chance.
1319409075013242884 2020-10-23 06:43:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Richard30223710 @AnnCoulter I don’t like Haley either. I’m not sure how much “influence” she has over Trump.
1319408503279263744 2020-10-23 06:41:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Richard30223710 @AnnCoulter What does that have to do with Trump?
1319407426672656385 2020-10-23 06:36:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Richard_Stud @Barnes_Law Nationwide.
1319406007790063618 2020-10-23 06:31:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnnCoulter Why would you not vote for Trump because of something Nikki Haley said?
1319402591680417793 2020-10-23 06:17:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Jimmy Carter is still eligible to be elected President.
1319402379930980352 2020-10-23 06:16:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @revjackashcraft I wouldn't put it past AOC to setup an OnlyFans if she thought it would drive out prog votes.
1319402138628390912 2020-10-23 06:15:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Guys, I really want to see Joe replaced by Walter Mondale a la 2002 Minnesota Senate.  (Yes, I see the date).
1319401480726728706 2020-10-23 06:13:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden Do these people think the average auto mechanic in Erie, Pennsylvania even knows who Jared Kushner is?
1319401044078637058 2020-10-23 06:11:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ZachBurke15 @RedEaglePatriot I'm not terribly worried given that most Republicans report wanting to vote on Election Day.
1319400781737590785 2020-10-23 06:10:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Wait, this actually happened? LMAO  https://t.co/13jCM4krG0
1319400272221917186 2020-10-23 06:08:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @down_the_summit Wait, which House member said that? What a moron.
1319399909062225925 2020-10-23 06:07:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 If he was just a generic establishment Republican like a young Mitch McConnell, I wouldn't care: He'll vote the way he's told in Washington. Clear he has Big Plans for The Future, though.
1319399217165684736 2020-10-23 06:04:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Another reason to cast your vote for Trump this November. Maybe this guy can finally retire to irrelevance too. Preferably in a foreign locale.
1319398618781093889 2020-10-23 06:01:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @down_the_summit If we are retaking the House, I doubt this race will matter much towards that anyway. It would suck if it's 218-217 Democrats, but such is life and special elections are a thing.  All politics is local when it comes to the House, even though national trends do matter.
1319398006521737219 2020-10-23 05:59:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jpoliticologist Mostly boilerplate, but it's Romney-Ryan boilerplate about "freedom." Biggest red flag: He says we need to "address" prejudice or racism in our society.
1319397139286577152 2020-10-23 05:56:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton I don't know, he did have that half baked sex scandal.
1319397038648365065 2020-10-23 05:55:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright It's not just that: Old people have this dumb tendency to listen to young people who tell them things they like to hear. This kid tells them things they like to hear, but are actually bad. Better he just scurry off to irrelevance.
1319396555670102017 2020-10-23 05:53:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Oblivion2elect1 @realikamusume In Lincoln's Day, they were run by Know Nothings and Populists.
1319395800389242880 2020-10-23 05:50:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Seriously, all this guy has to do is go like "I'm cool, young, Trump supporting guy. I will defend the President!"   Instead he chooses to pass off the politics of yesteryear's Ryans and Bushies as some kind of new paradigm.
1319395433379147776 2020-10-23 05:49:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @NickJFuentes @CawthornforNC Nick for Congress 2024.
1319394707747778567 2020-10-23 05:46:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Legit would vote for his opponent now.
1319394481259642886 2020-10-23 05:45:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CawthornforNC Wow. I already didn't like you. Now I'm not even sure I want you to get elected.
1319393788578701313 2020-10-23 05:42:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Backed up in triplicate, hidden in multiple safety deposit boxes in multiple banks with the security of Ft. Knox. Seriously.
1319392923511816198 2020-10-23 05:39:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @turdferguson691 @CrankyFed I'm half convinced it's a deep fake.
1319391537025978372 2020-10-23 05:33:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @Oblivion2elect1 That's more because of the exodus of California conservatives than shifts.
1319389528755503105 2020-10-23 05:25:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @EvaPilotNoa If Trump has "The Big Mo" going into Election Day, it will flip. Otherwise, I doubt it.

1319387111817170945 2020-10-23 05:16:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StarFox6441 @SelimSeesYou Yes: I think the movement overall is more vulnerable now than it was if Trump lost 2016. One reason I'm so committed to a win. 2016 you can easily sell a narrow loss as people just not being ready to turn over the reins to a non-politician. Now? Not so much.
1319383759578333185 2020-10-23 05:02:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JameseoTJ @JustinWStapley That's a nightmare. Sasse would be an awful President.
1319383405277184001 2020-10-23 05:01:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @boomerslayer @RyanGirdusky @CawthornforNC Honestly, I don't care about the ideology of House members unless it's truly horrific like Paul Ryan. Most of them just do what they are told.
1319382853763870721 2020-10-23 04:59:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ProudColonizer @VenomousStare @SelimSeesYou He thought Greg Orman was going to win Kansas until the night of. NC same deal for the Dem. Orman lost by like 11 points. Only reason Pat Roberts looked even vulnerable was an internal conservative challenger and they all came home at the end of the day: This was obvious.
1319382524154478593 2020-10-23 04:58:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Cringe.
1319382494802808841 2020-10-23 04:57:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JameseoTJ @JustinWStapley Cringe, bro, cringe.
1319382262023180290 2020-10-23 04:56:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @boomerslayer @RyanGirdusky @CawthornforNC My point isn't that I like Madison: I don't. My point is that you are deluding yourself if you think there's a crucial swing vote of 20% of voters in that district that will swing against him because of something not on his website. That's just stupid.
1319381793917861888 2020-10-23 04:55:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @VenomousStare @SelimSeesYou Dude, Nate Silver still has truly embarrassing tweets from 2014 up, and 2016, etc.
1319381359362773003 2020-10-23 04:53:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou 7 PM Election Night Frank Luntz: Just so it's clear, Biden will be sworn in on January 20th.
1319380992143097856 2020-10-23 04:51:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @boomerslayer @RyanGirdusky @CawthornforNC You're preaching to the choir here, but VOTERS do not place it that highly and that's just a fact. If you want to live in Ryan's delusional alternate universe where the number one issue among 70 million voters is immigration, go right ahead, but you're only fooling yourself.
1319380214158397454 2020-10-23 04:48:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot It’s not just modeled party: It’s where the votes are coming from. Lots of excitement evident in rurals. Little in urban centers.
1319380005881864192 2020-10-23 04:48:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @boomerslayer @RyanGirdusky @CawthornforNC It's part of the reason he pulled it off, but it's not only reason. More important in the key rust belt states was the issue of trade and job opportunities.
1319379789300568075 2020-10-23 04:47:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 2/2 Both are also pretty ruthless in their methods (though, Trump much less so than Putin, for cultural reason) of managing the corrupt parties over which they are forced to govern.
1319379562577514496 2020-10-23 04:46:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The reason centre-oriented politicians in the West hate Putin and Trump is essentially the same (and it's why they can't divorce the two in their petty minds): Both got put in charge of their countries after severe corruption of their ruling elites. 1/2  https://t.co/w7wObLmGj0
1319378543755788293 2020-10-23 04:42:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @boomerslayer @RyanGirdusky @CawthornforNC I vote on it, but you live in an alternate universe if you think it's the top issue for most voters. It's down in the teens as "most important issue" among voters even in 2016.
1319378215497093120 2020-10-23 04:40:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "Hey, the big guy over here wants to sell your jobs back to China. Just ask his son's former business associate over here."
1319377479694487557 2020-10-23 04:37:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @boomerslayer @RyanGirdusky @CawthornforNC Immigration is not "the most important issue" to the vast majority of voters.
1319377318360584212 2020-10-23 04:37:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ProudColonizer @RyanGirdusky @CawthornforNC Yeah, I'm not a Cawthorne fan by any stretch, but the idea removing immigration from a website almost no one checks is causing him to lose is a joke.
1319375927776784384 2020-10-23 04:31:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky @CawthornforNC Or maybe the DEM INTERNAL is just a load of shit and you should stop tweeting.
1319368146030125071 2020-10-23 04:00:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law @CBSNewsPoll @YouGov It's not even that they haven't returned their ballots yet. They haven't even requested them.
1319367693116542979 2020-10-23 03:59:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner @ProjectLincoln I was convinced of this when they squandered 1 million dollars of Gordon Getty's money.   The only contravening evidence is that Rick Wilson is a paid Qatari agent and they hate Trump. Then again, maybe that's part of it too.
1319367248340000773 2020-10-23 03:57:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou What questions could it possibly raise? It's completely legal to lend yourself money for your campaign and then pay it back from post-election fundraising.

1319355941725327361 2020-10-23 03:12:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @SelbJim He can stop by Virginia on his way between Florida and the Rust Belt. Turnout in Black areas? ABYSMAL. Like 10 points behind the state average.
1319355059784863746 2020-10-23 03:08:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim Just look at these first time voter numbers:  https://t.co/aUcmL4MnRv
1319354647673438209 2020-10-23 03:07:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim The turnout trend in Virginia is very Trump favorable.
1319354045644132353 2020-10-23 03:04:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law The base of the Republican has wanted what Trump offered them for a long time. He's finally getting to them and they wonder why all these undetected dispirited voters come out of the backwoods to get what they've been asking for since Bush 41.
1319352775394942977 2020-10-23 02:59:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KoenigJojo @BrianSh86084519 I believe so. Natives vote tribally. There was actually a big controversial election among the Cherokees last year for chief and the major issue was that the incumbent was a Democrat ally. The incumbent's ally lost.
1319351501396082692 2020-10-23 02:54:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I wonder why people don't trust "respected health officials" when it's quite obvious corona death and hospitalization rates are in the tank.

Not ok when Republicans do it with real ones.
1319350085549985792 2020-10-23 02:49:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks More than half of global media entertainment revenues go to video games (it's like 70 billion vs. 30 billion for everyone else). These people don't need more money.
1319349029713707009 2020-10-23 02:44:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law @NateSilver538 But they had finally mastered the Kansas game: Pretend to be an "independent" and then just caucus with and always vote for whatever Harry Reid/Chuck U. Schumer says.

1319347048207032320 2020-10-23 02:37:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DTReeves2 @Barnes_Law Pat Roberts was even more of a cookie cutter than Marshall.

1319338350139105282 2020-10-23 02:02:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LibertarianGC @realikamusume Voter registration makes that prospect bleak. Dems have registered 1.6 million new voters since 2016. Republicans only like 300K. To be fair, that's the first increase since 2004 for Republicans.
1319337138253684738 2020-10-23 01:57:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @realikamusume Regardless of what happens this election, a Republican will be the next governor of California.
1319336452359135233 2020-10-23 01:54:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LibertarianGC @realikamusume I just don't see Trump doing any better than 35 in California. But 35 for a Republican in the post-Bush era is amazing.
1319335386519396354 2020-10-23 01:50:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume There is no way Biden is up by 5 nationally with these numbers. No way.
1319332517607100418 2020-10-23 01:39:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 That’s why I tend to lean more towards 15-16 than 17-18.   Also, the ones that aren’t afraid vote Trump. I think we’ll see a shocking break among the youth vote: They’ll vote Biden, but not by that much.
1319332331090575360 2020-10-23 01:38:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Arguably stolen in the R-&gt;D states.
1319330965492322305 2020-10-23 01:33:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Absolutely not. Think we're on track for 15-18% at the most. Depends on if they show up on election day (The lion share of Dem votes on election day will be from young voters).

1319302631311986688 2020-10-22 23:40:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou We could be looking at what happened in 2016 too: A bunch of people assuming Clinton would win, so they voted Republican down ballot to check her. Perhaps people end up voting for Republican House members to check Biden/Harris.
1319301811271061504 2020-10-22 23:37:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I just don’t get where they’re expecting flips. Of course, these people Trump is also going down like Carter 80 (at least), so we will see.
1319301577556066304 2020-10-22 23:36:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Who would win: The head of the Irish mafia or some Iron Range miners?
1319299546934136832 2020-10-22 23:28:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed A lot of people think this story isn’t getting traction, but I think it is among the type of people who decide elections and the media is only furthering it and they don’t even know it. People just don’t trust the media.
1319296807915167744 2020-10-22 23:17:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads These people's OpSec is freaking embarrassing man.
1319289084766949398 2020-10-22 22:46:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @realikamusume Yeah, I would guess it's really in the 30s and 50s opposed.
1319288521367064578 2020-10-22 22:44:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @realikamusume There was one poll that was a reasonable proximity of that question that asked if they favored lockdowns. Nationally it was underwater 47-42. That was in one of the closer polls for Trump.
1319286512127627264 2020-10-22 22:36:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @realikamusume I think people were willing to give their governors some benefit of the doubt early on, but now that it's clearly a political game they're over it.
1319286230731812864 2020-10-22 22:35:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @realikamusume Basically as soon as people tuned in seriously, they were like "oh, this is bullshit" to put it bluntly.
1319284776541405184 2020-10-22 22:29:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Oblivion2elect1 @PNWRed According to one Wasserman article from WaPo. Color skeptical.
1319284111626833925 2020-10-22 22:26:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I've been saying since August: The red states with a GOP governor will vote Trump because corona will be over and done with. Only question is if he can convince one state that their economy is their governor's fault. He has done that.
1319146812553441280 2020-10-22 13:21:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BobbyBlueCollar @davidchapman141 Could be either. Depends on who exactly does the turning out. 2012 was an average year and Obama won. 2016 was just a little higher and Trump did. Republicans have become more reliable voters, though, so lower turnout tends to favor them.
1319143088850436097 2020-10-22 13:06:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BobbyBlueCollar @davidchapman141 I think it will end up pretty average. Lowest youth turnout since 2000, though.
1319142247628263424 2020-10-22 13:03:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @kokochsi @RedEaglePatriot These people were respectable once upon a time. Sad they’ve basically become a media operation for the Dems.

1319116951667560449 2020-10-22 11:22:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "Her position has been made more difficult by the President saying he needs to rush her onto the court in case he disputes the election results."  CNN produces nothing but nonstop lies.
1319116436804145157 2020-10-22 11:20:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @hayekguy1 Correct. PA they just made up an extension because of the "emergency."
1319116241353740289 2020-10-22 11:19:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates I prefer that, but the statutory requirement is the law as it stands.
1319116024218816513 2020-10-22 11:19:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rickymccarl1 I've seen so many weird and misplaced priorities in pop-Calvinism it's ridiculous. They take Calvin's phrase about our hearts being idol factories and then think anything you enjoy is an idol.
1319115510039064576 2020-10-22 11:17:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 True. Also, request needs to be submitted by Tuesday next week.
1319114669215436801 2020-10-22 11:13:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The "postmarked by election day" standard in North Carolina is the current statutory requirement. I don't see an appeal working there.
1319107994072875009 2020-10-22 10:47:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MonarchistSpirt Henry Clay is the best President we never had.

1319106880866783234 2020-10-22 10:42:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @lawlietg79 @SelimSeesYou Seems so. McSally is a terrible candidate and has a problem connecting fully with the Trump base and also with her old McCain-Republican base at the same time.
1319106580592398338 2020-10-22 10:41:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads They're banking so hard on Covid scares and "Trump sends mean tweets" it's ridiculous.
1319105533606068224 2020-10-22 10:37:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @lawlietg79 @SelimSeesYou I think he was in North Carolina more to help Thom Tillis than himself. Same with Arizona and Martha McSally.

1319103423481073665 2020-10-22 10:28:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m going a bit nuts with this stuff, but I genuinely like doing it.   However, if you cross-reference “already voted” tabs in basically any recent poll with actual ballot returns you get absurd conclusions about how many people are going to vote in every state I’ve checked.
1319102828959485953 2020-10-22 10:26:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law @nytimes Cross referencing the “already voted” tab with actual ballots returned leads to mind numbing inconsistencies.
1319102116850470912 2020-10-22 10:23:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They’re really banking on everyone being so afraid of Covid they think their sins will be cleansed by voting Biden.
1319098830390988800 2020-10-22 10:10:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @altamontcarl @thehangingchads Even with Obama, North Carolina went to Romney. It went to Obama by 14,000 votes in 2008, not exactly a landslide.
1319096419689680897 2020-10-22 10:01:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics I’ve thought this likely because of the Latino shift. If the Latino shift happens, he gets the WWC out, and there isn’t a huge shift against him in the 65+ crowd? Definitely a 5 point win.
1319095480584994816 2020-10-22 09:57:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly Forest seems to be making up ground as the public’s opinions on corona shifts. As people have tuned into the elections, they appear to have gotten sick of the corona lockdowns and mandates.
1319095186153242625 2020-10-22 09:56:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou It would get real ugly, I do believe.
1319094367114661888 2020-10-22 09:52:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly That’s because he’s going to win North Carolina.
1319092949112786945 2020-10-22 09:47:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @Peoples_Pundit He does. He’s probably the most responsive President in history to these concerns. Most Presidents are completely insulated from what their base thinks.

1319078261700370432 2020-10-22 08:48:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dvdpeters Priests are supposed to comport themselves in a certain way in public. Sir, you are a seminary professor and an ordained priest. This is beneath your dignity. What we’ve come to expect from the Synagogue of Satan that is the The Episcopal Church these days I guess.

1319075531485335554 2020-10-22 08:38:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Hey, @iamepiscopalian, one of your priests spends his time going on websites calling people names. Not sure this is who you want representing, but who am I to judge?

1319065337489428482 2020-10-22 07:57:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @billsretpal I've been track PA because of how important it is for both camps and right now there just aren't enough ballot requests out for Democrats to win Pennsylvania. They have a lead in mail in voting, but who cares if more people vote on election day.
1319064737754263554 2020-10-22 07:55:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @juukuchi @KingBroly Same. I'm not sure he'll actually do it. I'm not sure he needs to do it, but it would be incredibly strong. Remind voters why they voted for you in the first place.
1319064502567161856 2020-10-22 07:54:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @billsretpal I'm just kidding. They really need Pennsylvania. They talk about Trump needing Florida, but Biden needs Pennsylvania. There's no way he gets to 270 without Pennsylvania.
1319063957324337153 2020-10-22 07:52:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @juukuchi @KingBroly Trump has an art for firing volleys at the right time. The final debate is the right time to let loose here. Don't let there be any spin on it before the debate.  Don't fire until you see the whites in their eyes. Same principle.
1319063590977064970 2020-10-22 07:50:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @billsretpal I've heard it was a 10 point Biden states. Must just be trying to pad those pop vote numbers.

1319060152595714048 2020-10-22 07:37:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MilkZoomer We'll probably be fine, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. We're all in this together.
1319059994764103681 2020-10-22 07:36:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JackCWard99 @Vaiv71738794 @SelimSeesYou A higher portion of Republicans are first time voters than Democrats:  https://t.co/g3M7HQ2HFQ
1319058719167205377 2020-10-22 07:31:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs>  https://t.co/NO7HDulEYe is why conservatives own guns.
1319057448230113280 2020-10-22 07:26:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee And here conservatives were warning about what a disaster Federal Election Campaign Act would be by publishing this stuff.
1319045390117851138 2020-10-22 06:38:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Man77Nc @RedEaglePatriot @RyanGirdusky Because Jared it completely out of touch with Trump's base and he's in charge of way too much.
1319038209565884416 2020-10-22 06:09:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf @thehangingchads More people show up to random meetings of the local library book club.  If Biden wins, it's fraud.
1319035974991622146 2020-10-22 06:00:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly @BronzeCullis Honestly, stuff like this is stronger evidence that there's something to the whole thing than anything else. There's a whole mythos I have not engaged with that I doubt is real, but the idea there's Trump friendly IC people who are onto something conspiratorial is believable.
1319034567467110400 2020-10-22 05:55:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So, apparently there are disgruntled people on the inside or who were on the inside? Tell me: Why should I believe them any less than I believe an agency with an abysmal truth-telling record like the CIA?
1319034246971928582 2020-10-22 05:54:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The funny thing here is that Evan McMullin is basically saying that what QAnon believes about itself is basically true, just from the wrong angle.
1319033980675641344 2020-10-22 05:53:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly What Evan McMullin is proposing here is much closer to what QAnon believes about itself than what it's debunkers say, funny enough.
1319032459133157377 2020-10-22 05:46:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @b0nghitrnsplant @thehangingchads @Jogger_American A more common mix that you'd think, actually.
1319032137165754369 2020-10-22 05:45:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @Jogger_American Me when I'm 5.
1319031961365655552 2020-10-22 05:45:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jogger_American @thehangingchads I could honestly flip a coin between a sausage and a shredded beef taco. Would depend on my mood.
1319031333826531330 2020-10-22 05:42:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @Jogger_American There's just not as many fine dining Mexican meals. There's a few good ones, but German has stuff like wienerschnitzel and sauerbraten that's just on another level from stuff like carne asada. The two countries' wealth disparity is apparent.
1319030532425027584 2020-10-22 05:39:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jogger_American @thehangingchads German food is definitely higher quality. But who doesn't like a taco every now and then?
1319029167577550848 2020-10-22 05:33:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Can confirm.
1319028745198555137 2020-10-22 05:32:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf @Barnes_Law @538politics To be fair to Nate Silver, 538 is so influential that they probably can move betting markets. However, that would be correct. You could make money doing the opposite of what Nate says and assume the price for his pick is inflated simply by his analysis of the situation.
1319027776364699653 2020-10-22 05:28:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I've seen amateur sports bettors swear by 538. Lighting money on fire.
1319027463582867462 2020-10-22 05:27:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly I had a dream the other night I was at a party and George Bush was there. We had a very long conversation. Guess politics is on the brain.
1319026232852402176 2020-10-22 05:22:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PerfInjust Vote for Biden, the corrupt mob boss, because Trump sends mean tweets.
1319025406406758402 2020-10-22 05:18:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bae_miami @Barnes_Law If you still believe polls at this point, I have a bridge I'd like to sell you. I keep seeing stuff like this observation below in multiple states. Rasmussen also did it in Ohio and Penn yesterday.   https://t.co/gVI6laPcgn
1319024684168585229 2020-10-22 05:16:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HerbAlexander80 Hopefully we have people on the ground. Dems only got 18.5K requests in yesterday in PA.
1319024015797866500 2020-10-22 05:13:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HerbAlexander80 Phillies lagging pretty hard on requests. They might be planning on turning on the printing presses on election day there.
1319023484308234241 2020-10-22 05:11:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot I lied: It was an extra 18,561, so not even. Like, honestly, this is looking pretty abysmal on their side.   NPAs were an extra 6,055. People just don't trust mail ins in Pennsylvania.   They only have another 7 days including today and Tuesday.  @realikamusume @SelimSeesYou
1319021239273476099 2020-10-22 05:02:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Almost certainly. There's hardly a group of people in America more isolated from ordinary life than academic pollsters.
1319020634542886913 2020-10-22 05:00:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation To be fair, GIs have always been gross when it comes to sex.
1319019788828614656 2020-10-22 04:56:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SinoTriumph @BeigeShiba The experience you get in a country as a foreign guest is not the same as if you actually have to live and work there as an ordinary citizen, especially in these dictatorships.
1319019498914127875 2020-10-22 04:55:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Also, another note, I think more 2.7 million Democrats will show up to vote. How many more? Time will tell.
1319018442192805895 2020-10-22 04:51:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Like I keep seeing: It's rather obvious these polls are oversampling highly engaged people. I suspect they are oversampling highly engaged liberals and left-leaning moderates even more.
1319018074570477571 2020-10-22 04:49:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There's so much weird data in these polls. St. Pete Polls reported 41.2% of Democrats had already voted as of October 12th. However, if that's true AND we're lagging by 9 days in reported turnout, Dem turnout would still be only 2.7 million, which just isn't enough.
1319016863070883841 2020-10-22 04:45:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAFoshee @RedEaglePatriot @RealAPolitics @realikamusume I do think you could see an unprecedent vote strike of some kind there over rona. People in Vegas are not happy over the fear mongering destroying their economy.
1319016647139725314 2020-10-22 04:44:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot PA only had an extra 20K Dem requests yesterday reported. Not enough.
1319016125078904840 2020-10-22 04:42:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAFoshee @RedEaglePatriot @RealAPolitics @realikamusume Nationally, in person voting is appearing to favor Republicans. Nevada we just have to watch out for all the corrupt potential ballots in Clark.
1319015818512957441 2020-10-22 04:40:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @labor_law_dad @RedEaglePatriot A lot of x factors here it's impossible to account for.
1319014354977755136 2020-10-22 04:35:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @labor_law_dad @RedEaglePatriot I'm not sure how Florida is counting these. You can always return your marked mail in ballot in person, so that could count as returned mail-in stats wise.
1319013481182539779 2020-10-22 04:31:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot The only thing worrying is it does appear Dems are returning their mail in ballots at high rates. These things can always change. NC was looking bad, but it narrows by the day.
1319012707249651717 2020-10-22 04:28:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAFoshee @RedEaglePatriot @RealAPolitics @realikamusume I noticed this too.
1319012360229703683 2020-10-22 04:27:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biden needs to get at least 2 million votes in PA by mail in order to have a chance. Right now, he'd need a 100% return rate and to win NPAs by mail by 2/3 (assuming no crossover).
1319011860285370369 2020-10-22 04:25:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Regarding Pennsylvania: You still have to request your mail in ballot by next week on Tuesday.
1319010862338891777 2020-10-22 04:21:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law Their methodology here with using the midterms reminds one of a certain Mr. Karl Rove's poll unskewing in 2012.
1319010623888478211 2020-10-22 04:20:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law There's just not enough requests out there right now for this. I just don't know where these votes are supposed to come from. We're not seeing a huge youth surge. Nothing like that.
1319008824800444416 2020-10-22 04:13:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> With this, the running seven day average of returned ballots is 3129626, up significantly. However, with one less day, we're looking at 73 million early votes if it stays on course.
1319008275925508096 2020-10-22 04:10:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Daily early vote turnout report:  Total voters: 33,988,430 Increase: 4,520,104  National: Youth: 8.7-&gt;8.9% Infrequent Voters: 24.7-&gt;25.4%  Battleground:  Youth: 8.5-&gt;8.8% Infrequent: 24.5-&gt;25.2%  Another big day for California. Florida also had a huge day.
1319007407465504769 2020-10-22 04:07:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba It's like they forget that Aristotle distinguished between tyrannies and monarchies and I don't think anyone would doubt which one China is.

1319004516189151238 2020-10-22 03:55:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba Sick of even /ourguys/ falling for ChiCom propaganda.
1319002001414459392 2020-10-22 03:45:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Won't age well.

1318999280938606592 2020-10-22 03:35:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @thehangingchads The crossover rate right now in modeled voters would have to be like north of a third nationally for Biden to even have a prayer.
1318998171217989632 2020-10-22 03:30:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @milton_prescott @SelimSeesYou Some of the data we have from polls is obviously wrong. Rasmussen said a third of Pennsylvanians had already voted, but that would require a near doubling of the current return rate. Are that many really in the mail? IDK, maybe, but it seems unlikely.
1318994623524610048 2020-10-22 03:16:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago Right now, for Democrats to win, their mail in voting has to pick up a lot and they have to pray there's a lot of crossover Republicans voting Biden or third party. Just no evidence that's happening.
1318993871041417220 2020-10-22 03:13:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @SelimSeesYou There still aren't enough mail in ballot requests for Democrats to win Pennsylvania.
1318993404282380288 2020-10-22 03:11:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago Trump knows hot to peak at the right time. People keep act like "But early voting!" It doesn't matter. People who vote that early made up their minds months ago and very little can change their minds. Right now is when to unleash a barrage and he's doing it while Biden hides.
1318991846119559173 2020-10-22 03:05:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There's little doubt Trump has the momentum right now.
1318990382521327618 2020-10-22 02:59:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Only two polls have Biden above 50 in PA and one is Quinnipiac, so yeah, whatever.
1318989894266605570 2020-10-22 02:57:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sgaspari @JonWheaton @PollWatch2020 We've been saying this will happen at the end for months and then when it happens people still don't believe it.
1318989775525810176 2020-10-22 02:57:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sgaspari @JonWheaton @PollWatch2020 Act III. Are you this gullible?
1318989363921956865 2020-10-22 02:55:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sgaspari @PollWatch2020 By what metric?
1318982449611919365 2020-10-22 02:28:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @realikamusume I agree, but the more convincing the better in my opinion. More convincing means more political capital. More political capital means more stuff gets done.
1318982144958599170 2020-10-22 02:27:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim The lack of Strip culinary union employees is a big x-factor no one is talking about. Like, they're just not there. If their ballots are returned marked Biden, it's fraud. Probably will be difficult to prove in Nevada, though.
1318981120453640192 2020-10-22 02:22:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I agree with Baris: If Trump loses this election it's because there's a slim group of voters who are just tired of the last four years and want it to end. They won't vote Biden, but they might not vote at all.
1318980886658994180 2020-10-22 02:22:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @drfozzarelli @realikamusume So much of the national margin for Democrats will be wasted in California it's ridiculous. Even worse for Dems: It's going to be wasted in the Inner Bay Area and Inner Los Angeles. We won't see much movement in Orange County unless there's a ton of vote fraud (quite possible).
1318980439122583552 2020-10-22 02:20:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I think Trump can completely seal the deal tomorrow. Pray he's on point.
1318979834706599937 2020-10-22 02:17:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @juukuchi @realikamusume Dole and McConnell types, based on my experience in local parties, are skeptical of right wing insurgencies less because they view them as threats and more because right-wing insurgents often aren't team players and get bogged down in ideological minutiae.
1318979587817209857 2020-10-22 02:16:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @juukuchi @realikamusume The Bush-Ryan type of guys are literally just there because they want to co-opt the GOP to just be a tool of corporate donors or the neocon agenda. Folks like Dole and McConnell are ancestral Republicans and tend to be team players....
1318978018430377984 2020-10-22 02:10:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @juukuchi @realikamusume I've heard Bob Dole was a decent leader. Another "good establishment" type of guy.
1318976699296550914 2020-10-22 02:05:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @juukuchi @realikamusume Since McConnell has taken over as leader, the Republicans in the Senate have shaped up a lot. There used to be so many defections constantly, but he has really created a well-oiled machine.
1318975468851417088 2020-10-22 02:00:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Schumer is like a worse version of Harry Reid and without the ability to operate a political machine in a key swing state.
1318975075341770754 2020-10-22 01:58:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I mean, McConnell got 49.9% of the vote that year. Think he could have pulled it off anyway.   In any case, he's a shrewd politician and has been a valuable asset in the Senate. I think people knock him too hard. There's two types of establishment Republicans.
1318973770485403648 2020-10-22 01:53:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @whofarted_notme Yes, Trump's base is more enthusiastic, but there's a small group of voters who like Trump's policies, but are tired of the constant controversy. There's definitely a few million of these people and they might decide the election.
1318973504985927680 2020-10-22 01:52:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Back in the day, California was insanely pro gun control, even among Republicans. There just was no gun culture in the populated suburbs in SoCal or the Bay Area and not many hunters. Hunters kept the 2A alive for like 45 years until 94 Assault Weapons Ban made ARs cool.
1318963798129188864 2020-10-22 01:14:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 @thehangingchads There's 19 of them. Texas is just big because you'd expect there'd be a big registered Republican edge.
1318962094310653953 2020-10-22 01:07:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Is that overall based on registration? A lot of states lack partisan registration, inflating the independent numbers. Texas notably lacks partisan registration.
1318958415918616576 2020-10-22 00:52:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Do it.
1318956672451227649 2020-10-22 00:45:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The reason I'm confident Trump will get across the finish line is because people still fundamentally agree with Trump over Biden on the important issues. The only question is if they're willing to keep fighting for them.
1318955986820976640 2020-10-22 00:43:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Yes, @realDonaldTrump, do this. Literally the only reason he's not heading for a landslide reelection right now is because people are tired. People have felt literally under siege for the past 4 years. Some people need a reason to keep fighting.
1318954519435399168 2020-10-22 00:37:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> He has the opportunity to do this tomorrow at the debate.
1318954291172954112 2020-10-22 00:36:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Baris is right that Trump needs to reinforce his sales pitch from 2016. Voters are tired.
1318948367041441793 2020-10-22 00:12:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Trump should go to Rochester and then head over to Eau Claire.
1318947177771814914 2020-10-22 00:08:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis Guns. I know she's not going after him much on it, but the issue will work in Arizona and people do have minds of their own.
1318946932119797760 2020-10-22 00:07:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I wish she was a bit more willing to go after Kelly on guns. I don't get how that's not a bigger issue in Arizona.
1318946443311370242 2020-10-22 00:05:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Baris has McSally basically tied in Arizona. Think she'll pull it off.
1318946168416702465 2020-10-22 00:04:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @RealAPolitics Whatever makes the RCP average not look so bad it discourages voters.
1318942296675618817 2020-10-21 23:48:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Good point, folks. Wouldn't put it past these guys.
1318942059366125569 2020-10-21 23:47:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TRElections @realikamusume Mail in requests there are pretty abysmal for what Dems need.
1318934490719334403 2020-10-21 23:17:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @TrumpDucki California is catching up, though. They’ve dumped over a million ballots two days in a row.

1318765367716622337 2020-10-21 12:05:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FLGator193 With the higher number of votes in, they will need to start turning in their ballot fast to get to 2016 turnout levels overall. At the current rate of share increase, on the high side it will be at about 13% overall. Could be as low as 11.5% with 70 million votes in.
1318764854514225152 2020-10-21 12:03:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FLGator193 Percentage wise they are correct, compared to this time early voting, but you cannot compare the percentages because nearly 3 times as many people have voted. Overall, after everything was set and done, 18% of the vote was youth vote, right now it's 8.7%.
1318761895294357504 2020-10-21 11:51:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer Fact check: 100% true.
1318760051864195078 2020-10-21 11:44:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Even worse for Democrats, though, is the possibility turnout is actually going to start to slow. I see a lot states get up into the mid-30s and then start to slow significantly. Still a lot of states that have minimal returns and then dump a bunch.
1318758111751163904 2020-10-21 11:36:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If election day voting is 7 to 3 Trump (about average), and early vote, and pre election day is about 2:1, you get essentially a tie unless there's a massive to dropoff of voters overall (insanely low turnout).
1318756907251830785 2020-10-21 11:32:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It could pick up, but on the high end here we are taking 78 million unless it really picks up.
1318756668931526657 2020-10-21 11:31:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> With 6 days of tracking, I've averaged out daily returns at 2.9 million. If that holds, we will see about 70 million ballots returned. Which is about consistent with a normal 80-85% return rate on requested ballots, which are at about 84 million right now.

Maybe back in 1960 they could, but not with cell phone cameras and Trump on the watch for it. They'll be able to scrounge up some bogus ballots, but they still need signatures and each signature can be challenged in court.

If Trump wins Pennsylvania by tens of thousands of votes, they're not going to be able to scrounge up enough votes in Philly dumpsters to make up for it without starting a war.
1318739691689082880 2020-10-21 10:23:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly @BrianSh86084519 @realikamusume @HeritageNLegacy Calm down. I agree the stakes are immense right now, but there's really nothing you or I can do about this, I'm confident ACB will grant it, and I'm also confident that if Roberts had to rule on the merits he'd probably rule correctly. He hasn't ruled on the merits yet.
1318739353045184523 2020-10-21 10:22:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KarnatakaYankee I don't think we've ever seen a presidential election down 25% in turnout. That's including 1920 which uniquely was the first women could vote and a lot just weren't interested.

I honestly think Kagan and Breyer might join the majority. They law is pretty clear on this in a way it wasn't in Bush v. Gore.
1318737831209086988 2020-10-21 10:16:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @realikamusume @HeritageNLegacy @KingBroly I'm confident that we would get an emergency hearing. I do think Roberts will vote with the conservatives for a 6-3 decision in Trump v. Biden. The point of not hearing the case is so that you can let the bad individual ruling stand without making permanent bad law.
1318736693298683904 2020-10-21 10:11:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @realikamusume @HeritageNLegacy @KingBroly The law in all these states is that your absentee (i.e., mail-in as we are calling it) needs to be in by election day. The judges in multiple states have been like "well, there's an emergency, so no." That's not very...legal.
1318736327270191104 2020-10-21 10:10:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @basedinheaven2 @thehangingchads Also thanks Trump's policies. The Iron Range has benefitted more than any other single region of this country.

Some states have postmarked and received by x day as the legal standard. Problem with these new round of rulings is that they are nakedly against existing statutory law.

They could still take the case and issue an emergency stay. It's in a weird sort of legal limbo. They can also package all these cases and have the Trump and Biden campaigns be the parties.
1318734068410929152 2020-10-21 10:01:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I think we're going to get a whole package of cases late next week on this. "Trump v. Biden"

Meanwhile, Biden is hiding in his basement while the fmr. Mayor of New York accuses him of truly vile levels of corruption.

I actually think if Trump ran his 2016 campaign as an independent that year and had stayed in it after Perot dropped out, he probably would have won. Would have been a truly bizarre coalition of states too.

I actually think Republicans taking the House probably made that race unwinnable.   I don't think that's what saved Obama in 2012, though.

If the margins stayed constant in NoVA, improved in the Richmond area (in terms of net votes) and Trump got another 200K WWC to the polls in the South and West, it could happen.
1318693771442294784 2020-10-21 07:21:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Another note (I always end up doing these): First+Infrequent doesn't mean they didn't vote last election. An infrequent voter has a less than 40% propensity to vote. They might just vote in Presidential Generals and skip some of those. Also, a frequent voter might have not.
1318693401894727681 2020-10-21 07:19:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 2/2  California reported more than a million votes today, about 30% of the total and the modeled partisanship remained constant.  Youth vote is creeping up, but reminder that 18-29 year olds are typically 18% of the electorate. We're still on pace for much less.

Republicans always outperform among Florida Hispanics and usually among Tejanos and New Mexicans. NV/AZ Hispanics are close to the national average. VA Hispanics like CA.
1318685518201323521 2020-10-21 06:48:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Blacks can be as high as 15/85 on a low turnout. Similar with Hispanics, could be as high as 42/58 on low turnout.
1318685319932350469 2020-10-21 06:47:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Think it will end up being:  NCW: 70/30 CW: 50/50, but potentially 52/48 Trump if the women don't show Hispanics: 38/62 Blacks: 10/90
1318684663230173184 2020-10-21 06:44:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ProudColonizer @SelimSeesYou Trump's taken charge now it looks like to me and whenever Trump is in charge, the messaging is as close to on point as can be reasonably expected from a human being.
1318683920762884097 2020-10-21 06:42:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ProudColonizer @SelimSeesYou I'm ok with pandering to some degree and even with good laws that just so happen to benefit black people, but it's going way too far. If there's one thing that reeks of desperation from Team Trump it's the Black voter stuff, but I think they have backed off a little bit lately.
1318682515469701121 2020-10-21 06:36:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I think I'd have to beat my head against the wall. Especially if Trump outright won the Hispanic vote.
1318679187817975809 2020-10-21 06:23:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK There's one House seat in Virginia that's almost certain to flip back. Another is definitely on the table. If third one is even close, Trump would have to be within two of winning Virginia at least.
1318678515957551106 2020-10-21 06:20:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PoliCenright @realDonaldTrump The full context will be interesting, though.
1318677859154747392 2020-10-21 06:17:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @KingBroly Rasmussen has been trash since Scott Rasmussen left. It's like their numbers are just made up to generate a headline.
1318675154277466112 2020-10-21 06:07:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's quite obvious these polls are just oversampling highly engaged people. It's a pretty common problem. Why they wouldn't stop to check this against hard numbers, I don't know.
1318674006137016321 2020-10-21 06:02:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> By the largest estimates, 1,028,431 ballots have been returned so far. That is not 31% of the PA electorate. It would have to be nearly double that and that's like 90% of the requests out there.
1318673498953424900 2020-10-21 06:00:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TiddieChvmper2 @JayFiveK The Democrats need incumbency to be a factor for them to keep the House. Freshman incumbents in a Presidential year are always vulnerable. There's few Democrat pickup opportunities even in a narrow Trump loss, let alone a Trump win.
1318672803034443778 2020-10-21 05:57:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK A uniform national swing of 5% against the Democrats results in a Republican House. There's scenarios where Trump narrowly loses the election and the Republicans regain the House.
1318671332389933058 2020-10-21 05:52:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation There's probably a whole angry mob outside.   Dudes into feet are just creepy. They also tend to be way too forward. A few years ago I had to brush one off who was trying to hit on my mother by asking to take a picture of her feet. Like, dude, wtf is your problem?

1318669422559715329 2020-10-21 05:44:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> As it should be.

I think the disconnect is partially caused by the pan/bisexual girls who are really just whores others perceive as straight.
1318664326266425345 2020-10-21 05:24:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Is that why Democrat vote rich Cuyahoga County is lagging the state average return by 4 points?
1318663161080352769 2020-10-21 05:19:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation More reasons not to trust polling. I saw a poll that showed a quarter of zoomers identify as some kind of queer, but only a third knew someone that was queer. The math there just doesn't add up.

1318640927469146112 2020-10-21 03:51:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @down_the_summit @SelimSeesYou I honestly don't think it will even impact that. I believe most of the surge is from heavily Democrat districts anyway.
1318640608832094208 2020-10-21 03:49:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou 80% of Trump voters say election day I believe, so with a turnout surge on the Trump side, that still would not be enough.
1318640403009146880 2020-10-21 03:49:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I just checked PA again: Still only 1,807,025+293,563 Democrat+NPA ballot requests. 701,915 GOP. 2/3 Biden voters say they're voting by mail. He needs to get basically all of those D+NPA ballots in and pray the NPA break 2:1 in his favor to get to 3 million.
1318638920683409408 2020-10-21 03:43:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou At least 30 million of those are in the all mail in voting states, including over 21 million in California.
1318638779998097408 2020-10-21 03:42:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Right now, there still just aren't enough Democrat requests nationally to bank enough votes. I think we need 100 million ballots out, at least 80 million returned by election day for them to even hope for a win. We're at about 83 million requested (100% returned is a red flag).
1318638103003791360 2020-10-21 03:39:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou He's right. Particularly in the swing states, their vote leans heavily towards old reliable voters so far. The one place there's some indication of unreliable Democrat voter surge is California, but that is the one state where it is consistent with voter registration trends.
1318637251992182785 2020-10-21 03:36:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @paleomexicano @tz_redivivus One drop rule, but for wokeness.  (This is actually a thing).
1318636761409617922 2020-10-21 03:34:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume This is what you do after the election when you don't want a disastrous midterm.
1318636601996705800 2020-10-21 03:33:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is not a winning campaign, folks.
1318636412506341376 2020-10-21 03:33:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So now Biden is desperate enough to float GOP members as part of his potential cabinet to scrounge up whatever votes he can grab from moderate Indies afraid of the left.

1318634423714185218 2020-10-21 03:25:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just saw a 49-44 Biden MN poll where 80% of those who already voted said they voted for Biden, but the TargetSmart data shows 25% or so of the vote in is GOP-leaning plus a bunch unaffiliated obviously. One of them is wrong and I trust voter files more than polls.
1318633876252708864 2020-10-21 03:23:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Prior to early voting, I didn't trust the polls because my gut told me not to.   With early voting numbers, logic dictates you have to uphold a contradiction in order to trust polling.
1318633054739615745 2020-10-21 03:19:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Here's the only things we know from this:  1. If Biden wins, the polls were wrong that a significantly disproportionate amount of Democrats would vote early or by mail. 2. If Trump wins, the polls were wrong that Trump would lose.   Either way, the polls are the losers.

Only issues with a significant amount of room between Romney and Trump are trade and rhetorical style and the second is surface level.

1318592742314967047 2020-10-21 00:39:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Probably right, but the key lesson that needs to be learned is among conservatives to simply ignore these people.
1318589686558896131 2020-10-21 00:27:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume If Trump wins the popular vote it will likely be from narrower margins in Illinois and New York, and an increased margin in multiple swing states and Texas.
1318587215946055680 2020-10-21 00:17:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads 91,000 net votes is 1.5% of the overall 2016 vote.

1318575784190238721 2020-10-20 23:32:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The problem for Democrats in Nevada is that there are so many fewer Strip employees and the ones left aren't enthused about voting for the party that killed their jobs. The corrupt Reid machine might have enough bad ballots, though.

1318558611304534017 2020-10-20 22:24:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart I know a lot of random geography stuff, but the world is a big place. Not reasonable for most people to know all sorts of random geography facts about places they will never go or care about.
1318556062023405570 2020-10-20 22:13:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @based_coder @NationalistTV @realikamusume There's a reason they're not even releasing another poll.
1318551467763159045 2020-10-20 21:55:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume "There are enemies among us!"
1318547812775321602 2020-10-20 21:41:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump got his base to come home and convinced independents! Democrats just didn't vote! How were we to know?
1318547033725325316 2020-10-20 21:38:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume IBD has a vested interest in knowing a real outcome as opposed to other media polls that are just in the tank at this point.
1318431869097168902 2020-10-20 14:00:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law It’s not just the modeled partisan affiliation in a lot of these cases, it’s where the vote is coming from. With some exceptions, votes in Democrat strongholds are pretty lackluster compared to state averages.
1318424154799067136 2020-10-20 13:29:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @JayFiveK And that’s in blue Tucson. I just feel like this will break more than we dare hope.
1318423312888958982 2020-10-20 13:26:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Networks used to hold off on calling the overall election until at least California closed. Don’t know when this stopped.
1318420262262591488 2020-10-20 13:14:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics North Carolina, though, has the X factor where it has the old registered Dems who always vote Republican for President. These are shrinking every year.
1318419513352880128 2020-10-20 13:11:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @HeritageNLegacy @SirDowden @JBFalke This is done as hoc right now. For instance, late boomers like Mark Steyn have been classified as “Generations Jones.” People noticed they were more culturally conservative than older boomers and their political attitudes were informed more by the events of the late 70s.
1318419063832498177 2020-10-20 13:09:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If Trump wins this narrowly, it will be because of him forcing Pelosi to go insane over the relief bill.
1318418369822052359 2020-10-20 13:06:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @RupertVonRipp @SirDowden @JBFalke By that I mean, you have larger generations of apx. 20 years and then those are subdivided into 3-4 cohorts.
1318418074517835776 2020-10-20 13:05:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @RupertVonRipp @SirDowden @JBFalke Generations should probably be divided into 5 year cohorts.
1318416642267881473 2020-10-20 12:59:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou It's the reason I'm keeping an eye on their urban areas and the Black percentage of the vote.
1318415942506991618 2020-10-20 12:57:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou They really need those urban blacks to show. If they don't, they're screwed. Even in a good year for Dems their numbers are heavily padded by their inner city margins. 2012 is a perfect case in point.
1318415666005856257 2020-10-20 12:56:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon That was their number last time, I tend to agree they will shrink this time.
1318413272949886976 2020-10-20 12:46:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GroyperOregon Way too high as in turnout or for one candidate? I didn’t tinker with that at all as doing my standard “shrink to 50 and give Trump 12” would make the map looks ridiculously red.  Also, I think you’re right that we could see near Bush level Hispanic support for Trump.
1318411548398964737 2020-10-20 12:39:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I find the odds of this pretty slim on a national level, but it is quite possible you see it in swing states. Also, these broad demos in Cook aren't granular enough to take into account all the variables.
1318411028787494916 2020-10-20 12:37:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The suburban and college educated vote is where any shy Trump support exists. This is why I think things *could* end up breaking much more significantly for Trump than most believe. If they are both underestimating WWC and there's a shy Trump college vote, this could be the map:  https://t.co/3TcA0kQTf3
1318408799544377344 2020-10-20 12:28:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JBFalke @SirDowden @RupertVonRipp I suspected he was older than he appeared because he's been around as long as I can remember, but he really does look younger than his age, and perhaps acts younger still.
1318407170837434370 2020-10-20 12:22:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @RupertVonRipp I think we have a winner, honestly, if he wanted a permanent fill in spot. Mark Steyn is smart and hilarious. He is 60, though.
1318406010655178753 2020-10-20 12:17:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @wasphyxiation They don't have too many redeeming qualities, that's for sure.
1318404806952833026 2020-10-20 12:12:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer If the courts European female monarchs are anything to go by....well, just imagine the depths of whoredom we can still reach with women running everything.
1318404515436109825 2020-10-20 12:11:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAFoshee It is pretty sad.
1318404242152038400 2020-10-20 12:10:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @HeritageNLegacy Yeah, most of them are controlled oppo (which I never bought that Limbaugh was, as he emerged organically). I just don't see Tucker having the clout Rush did. Nick Fuentes has painted himself into a corner, but he has the personality for it, which isn't a common one.
1318402970866900993 2020-10-20 12:05:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @RupertVonRipp I'll be honest, I think my most controversial take in these parts is that Tucker is overrated. I just can't see him able to do a three hour show and that's a necessary format in this business apparently.
1318402222074613761 2020-10-20 12:02:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp If Trump wins, I think you might see someone riding his coattails take up the mantle. Rush Limbaugh essentially kept Reagan's legacy alive through his program. Someone might end up being that, but for Trumpism.
1318401718539948034 2020-10-20 12:00:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAFoshee I commented on that earlier. Despicable. Like I said, I stopped listening to him religiously when he spent too much time on air with his petty personal issues with other hosts.  His opinion on Hannity has always been spot on, though.
1318401435575455745 2020-10-20 11:59:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Who even is there? Sean Hannity? Mark Levin? Lars Larson used to be good forever ago, but he never took off outside Portland.   This might be devastating for the conservative movement. 50 million people tuned into Rush's show for the convo between him an Trump. FIFTY MILLION.
1318400769096404992 2020-10-20 11:56:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation I've personally only ever owned one pair because of how crappy of a shoe they are overall. They seem nice until they're perpetually dirty and fall apart nearly instantly.
1318400062079275014 2020-10-20 11:54:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp He's so funny. It will be the end of a great era. Most on talk radio tries to be Rush and none really succeed.
1318399670360694785 2020-10-20 11:52:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I think they're amping this stuff up because the gun vote is actually Trump's weakest point in the coalition. A lot of these people are one issue voters and extremely dogmatic on it.   The bump stock ban was inexcusable, though.
1318398815683084293 2020-10-20 11:49:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The people in the replies to this are some really sick animals that should be ashamed of themselves.
1318396408379133952 2020-10-20 11:39:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried *42 million new voters. However, at lot of these polls would have more like 150 million plus turnout, unless there was a dropoff of the GOP vote unprecedented in modern times. That would 45+ million new voters.
1318395791208255491 2020-10-20 11:37:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried 20-30 million new voters would be pretty average low propensity voter turnout at 140-150 million total votes. It actually looks like we will hit something like that. To get the 30% low propensity voter turnout these polls predict, at 140 million votes you would need 33 million.
1318391218909401088 2020-10-20 11:18:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AsianMilo @RiddleguyMan Ann lives in a policy echo chamber.
1318387591692099585 2020-10-20 11:04:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou When I say “thing have changed wildly,” I mean early vote can mean all sorts of things. In any case, the polls are looking gross right now.
1318387285918875649 2020-10-20 11:03:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Yeah, I’m holding back because things have changed wildly, but...
1318381101174448130 2020-10-20 10:38:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Really sick of people projecting their petty personal issues into grand political narratives.
1318378704242954240 2020-10-20 10:29:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @billsretpal No surge of youth vote really

1318344332538236929 2020-10-20 08:12:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @secret_returns @realikamusume Don’t put your eggs in one basket.
1318343695993872386 2020-10-20 08:10:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This needs to stop. NEEDS TO STOP
1318343116802445313 2020-10-20 08:07:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 And an incredibly low turnout election. One reason the Popular Vote is total garbage.
1318342456560226304 2020-10-20 08:05:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Yes. I think other agencies called it early too.
1318342383025770499 2020-10-20 08:04:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @SelbJim Kind of my type. So yeah.
1318340848669675520 2020-10-20 07:58:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim I'd simp for this girl any day of the week.
1318340538677022721 2020-10-20 07:57:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm convinced they're going to pull multiple 2000s Florida and call things they shouldn't.   That 2018 House call was irresponsible and against norms of journalistic ethics. They got away with it once. Will they do it again?
1318338858958917632 2020-10-20 07:50:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Vote on Amy Coney Barrett this week, @senatemajldr
1318338320913567754 2020-10-20 07:48:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MaritimeLoyal But the deficit is bigger this time! No way he pulls it off! Joe isn't as unlikable as Hillary!  Yeah, whatever, I'll believe when I see it at this point. They even had to steal a Senate and at least 4 House seats to not make 2018 look....underwhelming.

1318327647525621762 2020-10-20 07:06:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @LuisBobby3 @LeVanderBrock Neither am I, really. Just saying it’s the only place where the Democrat path even exists in early voting.
1318327310697795585 2020-10-20 07:04:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 @thehangingchads We’ve been saying the polls will likely do this for months near the end. Now watch the election mafia use them to reinforce the reliability of their trash polls.

1318314283017658368 2020-10-20 06:13:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> What if the RNC is driving out voters in Michigan so the Biden camp freaked out there and didn’t notice their other problems?
1318313712386715649 2020-10-20 06:10:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads When people read this they read it as “Trump has cancelled ALL ads.” That’s just not the case.

1318257960779472903 2020-10-20 02:29:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Unless voting picks up a lot this week, I just don't think they're on track to bank enough votes.
1318255480519655434 2020-10-20 02:19:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 No update today yet. I'll do my daily report tonight.

1318250587335675905 2020-10-20 02:00:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Might end up voting early and having the Fairfax County Elections Board throw away my vote. "Straight ticket GOP, in the trash."
1318244511903059970 2020-10-20 01:35:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TiddieChvmper2 Same people for the most part.
1318243345152544776 2020-10-20 01:31:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TiddieChvmper2 He reminds me of old shitlibs when we'd head into San Francisco as a kid. Hopelessly snarky. Unfriendly to strangers. Makes godawful amounts of money, still can't figure out how to put together a stylish outfit.
1318241816542674944 2020-10-20 01:25:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 I really want the closing message of the Trump campaign to be on the post-Covid economy. It seems they're gearing up for that. We will see at the debate.
1318240293980938240 2020-10-20 01:19:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @joehiden16 I think this is backfiring on Democrats. Their entire gamble here was to keep their states closed to make the economy look bad, but I feel like the rust belt states have just ended up blaming their Democrat governors because people aren't that dumb.
1318239925758758914 2020-10-20 01:17:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ComradeDoyIe How is socialism any different? Confused.
1318238905225924609 2020-10-20 01:13:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @realikamusume The Republican vote leans more towards the unreliable voters than the Democrat vote (mean a higher percentage of the Republican vote is low propensity than the Democrat). Very good sign in a tilt Republican state.
1318238663520800768 2020-10-20 01:12:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @realikamusume They narrowed the gap (percentage wise) on the first day of North Carolina in person voting. Will need to wait and see, but of the swing states, it looks the worst for Republicans. No signs of youth turnout and the Democrat vote still leans heavily towards reliable voters....
1318231910074679298 2020-10-20 00:45:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReactionaryIan @TheNostromoDos @RyanGirdusky Yes. 10-15% and low turnout is the norm in the post civil rights era. They’re kind of hoping Biden is viewed as an extension of Obama and drives up margins and turnout in that community. Seems unlikely right now.
1318231223261593600 2020-10-20 00:43:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @realikamusume Republicans narrow the gap everyday and there’s still no indication of a youth or minority vote surge, especially in key swing states.
1318230861603627008 2020-10-20 00:41:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheNostromoDos @RyanGirdusky I understand. Bush got 11%. Trump got 7%.

1318220882528043014 2020-10-20 00:02:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon 538 also does poll unskewing for their data models, which is hilarious given how much they insult the GOP for doing that.
1318220700923138057 2020-10-20 00:01:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation I'm a politics nerd and the only time I listen to that much political talk is near the election and when I'm on a long drive and the talker is talking about something interesting to me.
1318220333267247111 2020-10-19 23:59:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MilkZoomer Rasmussen's polling seems incredibly lazy at this point.
1318219370229878784 2020-10-19 23:56:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Every metric we have, from yard signs, voter registrations, to polling data suggests the White Working Class is more excited about Trump in 2020 than they were in 2016. Ryan and Ann live in policy echo chambers where Trump is a disappointment because he didn't close the border.
1318219030302511107 2020-10-19 23:54:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Leave it to Ryan to present data sans context. Neither of these shifts are monumental shifts and entirely precedented in the recent history of the Republican Party. Also, Trump losing 3-4% of the White vote is totally discounting the enthusiasm gap among low propensity voters.
1318217384927309825 2020-10-19 23:48:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky Gaining 4% of Black voters is not "monumental" it's literally exactly what Bush got in 2004.
1318216218097188872 2020-10-19 23:43:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @realikamusume My confidence in this election grows with each new TargetSmart early vote dump.
1318215625999814663 2020-10-19 23:41:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation I'm convinced The Lincoln Project is a deep fake Trump group at this point. They've squandered literally millions of Democrat donor money while lining their own pockets.
1318214963790479360 2020-10-19 23:38:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Unfortunately, I'm not seeing a poll from them in 2016. I note Remington had it Clinton+8 on the eve of the election.
1318214151764889600 2020-10-19 23:35:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Trump is basically tied when you squeeze more of those vote parkers out of Jo Jorgenson anyway.
1318213783693807617 2020-10-19 23:33:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Signed, Walter Mondale.
1318212766419791874 2020-10-19 23:29:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @4dchessmaster1 Same reason Republicans shouldn’t campaign in urban cores.
1318212695427026952 2020-10-19 23:29:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @4dchessmaster1 Lowering margins for your opponent in their strongholds can contribute to a win. Problem is that when you’re talking about some place like the Florida Panhandle, it’s such a stronghold that I think you drive up your opponent’s margin by the act of campaigning there.
1318209393146605573 2020-10-19 23:16:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Such a nice word to distinguish between something healthy and normal and something creepy and gross.
1318206742480695298 2020-10-19 23:05:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis I find most conversion to a religion besides Christianity has something to do with a prurient interest in sex.
1318204177554771969 2020-10-19 22:55:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Across all these states it appears the early vote lead from the Democrats was caused by urban/suburban college educated White liberals blowing their wad too soon. Across all these states, that's what is driving the Democrat lead. These people are basically irrelevant.
1318202272225071105 2020-10-19 22:48:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bertento @AirBossUT5 Their entire theory on ACB was demonstrably false and people just kept repeating in ad nauseum.
1318201240417861632 2020-10-19 22:44:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads My policy has generally been to ignore ecelebs.
1318200280207548417 2020-10-19 22:40:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bertento @AirBossUT5 Not sure about that. We all have our blind spots.
1318199855366479877 2020-10-19 22:38:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bertento @AirBossUT5 Too influenced by Barnes on this front and Barnes is convinced there are no Evangelicals in Michigan when Michigan has its own internal Bible Belt.
1318199475542937602 2020-10-19 22:37:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @liobserver @RyanGirdusky You can't plan life around natural disasters. You typically see hurricanes at least a week before they hit Florida too.
1318198863140966401 2020-10-19 22:34:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky You know, unless you want to wait until election day. This is a free country.
1318198620823429123 2020-10-19 22:33:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Vaiv71738794 @SelimSeesYou Trump is getting low propensity voters. Biden isn't. Simple as. These polls have the electorate all wrong and the rallies tell the story.
1318197443050209280 2020-10-19 22:28:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I actually think ads might be a net negative for Trump in Minnesota, to be honest. The biggest media market by far is the Twin Cities and that's Biden's base. Might drive up negative turnout.
1318196875506388992 2020-10-19 22:26:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TrustThePlant @SelimSeesYou Orange County has like 3 or 4 House seats Republicans can potentially regain. Pretty vote rich. If Republicans manage to recapture it, that would be very good news.
1318196592223113216 2020-10-19 22:25:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Vaiv71738794 @SelimSeesYou True, but getting people to line the streets is pretty powerful. This was in Newport Beach, which did vote for him in 2016, but just these people lining the streets capture a significant vote percentage there.
1318051219739377666 2020-10-19 12:47:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly There was a whole Trump neighborhood that had their Trump signs stolen near me and they’ll make this an incident of terrorism lmao.
1318045848710926336 2020-10-19 12:26:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Supreme_Chungus Fact check: True
1318036291750154240 2020-10-19 11:48:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates I’m convinced a lot of typical old people problems, especially on the mental side, are a result of not socializing enough with younger people. Most people who don’t confine themselves to retirement communities seem to stay sharper unless they get a legitimate disease.
1318035309632827392 2020-10-19 11:44:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @hndlunspecified @ScottMGreer How do you forget you’re wearing a mask. Only time you’ll catch me with one on outside a business at all is running into or out of said business.
1318034934242619392 2020-10-19 11:43:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @revjackashcraft I don’t really know anything about this other denomination, but I’m weary of using size as a selling point for REC.
1318033921527980033 2020-10-19 11:39:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @revjackashcraft I’m a REC member, but twice nothing is still nothing. REC is still a microdenomination.
1318032774503215104 2020-10-19 11:34:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SmrtFrijoles @SelimSeesYou Most people feel guilty if they don’t drop at least a 20 in the plate in my experience.
1318032053527601152 2020-10-19 11:31:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaleoEconomist There’s huge evidence the Iron Range has flipped and that provided about half of Hillary’s margin in 2016. Signs of increased turnouts in rurals as well. Trump could carry all but 4 counties in the state. As long as he doesn’t get swamped in MSP, he’s in good shape.
1318030955685228546 2020-10-19 11:27:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DarkSergey2 @GranTorinoDSA Next election people will be begging her not to vote for them.
1318030765809147905 2020-10-19 11:26:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GranTorinoDSA This is the dating pool I’m dealing with in this county.
1318028701943169024 2020-10-19 11:18:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @crypto_passion @CottoGottfried We can get an idea of if that’s even possible by ballot returns.
1318026898576912386 2020-10-19 11:11:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed I have read about these in the past and they are, in fact, terrifying.
1318023483557879808 2020-10-19 10:57:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Lmao.
1318020351595548673 2020-10-19 10:45:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I think they’re regressing even more, honestly. Part of the reason Trump needs to win.
1318005792256217088 2020-10-19 09:47:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @realikamusume This is the guy whose focus groups constantly told us Trump did horribly in the debates. Meanwhile Trump just kept rising in the polls.

1318004436871110658 2020-10-19 09:41:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume It’s like these people forget 2016 even happened. Spend the money on Election Day get out the vote efforts.
1317998341029007361 2020-10-19 09:17:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer I'd also note that Latin American Catholics do appear to be more religious than those still in Latin America.
1317998016851300358 2020-10-19 09:16:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer If Republicans get a surge of votes from Latinos, it will be because enough of them have converted to Anglo-American Evangelicalism. A lot of them are converting (this is a pan-Latin America phenomenon, not limited to immigrants to the States).
1317989797907103746 2020-10-19 08:43:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics When I say "who knows?" I mean that literally no one does: Not even Nate. That's how unscientific and ridiculous the whole operation is.
1317989675345321985 2020-10-19 08:43:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics 2....Of course, this is why polling election prognostication is a pseudoscience in the first place. Human beings don't function this way, and it produces obviously bunk possibilities. Who knows how much of this noise affects Nate's model.
1317989358734114817 2020-10-19 08:42:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Basically Nate Silver runs the numbers for as many possible scenarios given current polling numbers at state levels (and probably nationals). Given how many scenarios this is, there are a lot of weird ones that will never actually happen, but it is technically possible....1/2
1317988955451777024 2020-10-19 08:40:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation Very true. Nearly every non-Hispanic White (and some of the Hispanics) can claim ancestry here before independence (and, thus, Anglo ancestors) besides very insular ethnic clans. Lots of people choose to identify with their one Irish grandparent or whatever instead.
1317987250022604800 2020-10-19 08:33:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Still looks to me like college-graduate liberals got really excited to turn in their ballots. Basically everywhere is showing a narrowing gap between Republicans and Democrats or a widening lead for Republicans where they had one already.
1317986761436520449 2020-10-19 08:31:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Daily turnout update (it is Sunday, so grain of salt, but we did get votes from TN+WA, around 610K)  Total turnout: 24,943,285 Increase: 2,460,838  Youth: 8-8.2% Infrequent+First Time voters: 23.9%
1317977450249396224 2020-10-19 07:54:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @yogurt_chunk @RedEaglePatriot To be fair, that was months before the election. Still probably way off.
1317972697465430019 2020-10-19 07:35:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed And having an eschatology that history is one progression towards greater and greater moral perfection is also totally cool.
1317971913008943104 2020-10-19 07:32:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp There’s always a state religion.

1317966919681671168 2020-10-19 07:12:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot And most of these polling averages were only saved by a couple of right leaning polls that aren’t polling for the most part.
1317955063155929088 2020-10-19 06:25:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Reactionaryguy He’s kind of an arrogant jerk and obsessed with making his esoteric points.
1317954085363081222 2020-10-19 06:21:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @michaeljpsallee @dondero_e @LarrySchweikart Yeah, but lower turnout in Fairfax and Richmond City right now. A lot of turnout is being driven by some Trump friendly rurals.
1317951497053851649 2020-10-19 06:11:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 Addicted to losing: Our criticism of the eGOP from the beginning. Literally completely incapable of self-reflection.
1317944596438069248 2020-10-19 05:44:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 @StaresInStoic Bunning ran a pretty terrible campaign against a pretty conservative Democrat.
1317937495393316867 2020-10-19 05:15:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> A lot of my political followers won’t know this person.
1317937325809217543 2020-10-19 05:15:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Random: Jay Dyer blocks me. I don’t know why, but I’m kind of proud of this fact.
1317935699967070211 2020-10-19 05:08:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump is either conceding the race or wants to win back the House.

1317933303652098048 2020-10-19 04:59:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NewEra_05 I just don’t know how we come back together after this.
1317932777526992901 2020-10-19 04:57:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Pathetic and evil individuals.
1317927298843217922 2020-10-19 04:35:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume That means only 10,000 Republican mail ins are outstanding, though.
1317926200271097856 2020-10-19 04:31:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @juukuchi There’s some complications with that this year. There were legit supply chain issues this year that will probably reverberate through next year at least.
1317925011898892290 2020-10-19 04:26:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad That might be part of it. Women were more compelled to work in the home because they didn’t work outside the home. Now domestic labor is supposed to be more equitable, but equitable does now often mean “men do most of the chores.”
1317924595614318594 2020-10-19 04:24:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Nate “My Models Don’t Account for National Polls” Silver has Texas going for Trump. Here’s the RCP average in Texas:  https://t.co/BheAg03WlZ
1317923236378791937 2020-10-19 04:19:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @black_knights92 @RedEaglePatriot Much more confident now. All of her choices have lost the election.
1317923145580531717 2020-10-19 04:18:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot What kind of lame woman shows up to vote McCain in 2008?
1317922257113665538 2020-10-19 04:15:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad People used to argue against the suffragettes by saying women had too much power already.
1317922147969519616 2020-10-19 04:15:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad Women have always had a lot of power with decent guys. I mean, St. Paul says that men are distracted by pleasing their wives.
1317921531838795780 2020-10-19 04:12:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad Well, that’s a pretty common problem across relationships.
1317918675702341644 2020-10-19 04:01:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @carlos77carpizo @ByzCat It would still need to be validated against them to be truly scientific and I’m not sure if election prediction could ever be described as “scientific” as it does involve the exercise of often arbitrary human will.
1317917159364960256 2020-10-19 03:55:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @carlos77carpizo @ByzCat What Nate Silver said was that this was a *likely* outcome. As for the probabilistic nature of predicting election outcomes, the problem is that we will never run enough national elections to validate Silver’s model.
1317916693973315585 2020-10-19 03:53:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat Any map that involves Trump losing Texas at this point just isn’t serious. Silver claims his model doesn’t involve national polls, but this is the only way you get a “big cluster” of results with Trump losing Texas.
1317915819184168960 2020-10-19 03:49:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @VictorGlover07 @RedEaglePatriot Cool story, bro.

1317905676392423425 2020-10-19 03:09:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StaresInStoic Cocaine Mitch hung on in 2008. They always think they’re going to get him and he always hangs on. Usually by a wide margin.

Rural Dems are more likely to crossover than urban and suburban Dems. If we are seeing higher relative returns in rurals, that’s a good sign for Republicans even if they’re registered Dems.
1317898416249253888 2020-10-19 02:40:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> At the risk of stating the obvious: Early voting dynamics are different in every state.

1317896151677403137 2020-10-19 02:31:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot And the return rate is slowing.
1317895353287532546 2020-10-19 02:28:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AirBossUT5 I see half-witted sports betting prognosticators taking Nate Silver’s model as some kind of time-tested model. It isn’t. Just as a matter of statistics, we will never run enough Presidential elections to determine the truth of the model.

1317892203423895555 2020-10-19 02:16:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @secret_returns @realikamusume POLITICAL CAPITAL. Trump could barely get anything done because his win was so narrow he had no mandate. I want a mandate.
1317891882224132098 2020-10-19 02:14:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I think he’s being conservative. Predicting a Trump win at all could be death if it doesn’t happen in this environment. But if you say he will win with just above 270 votes and if he wins with 316+, you won’t get the shaft.

1317890426335039489 2020-10-19 02:08:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Complacency happens when you’re voting to reelect someone like Mayor Daley for the third time during an off cycle election. That’s when you see 10% turnout rates.
1317889279637524481 2020-10-19 02:04:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Texas Early Vote is really looking good for Republicans. I believe Texas and Arizona will experience a “dead cat bounce” for Republicans this year as they trend towards Democrats. I the think the rust belt’s dead cat bounce for Dems happened in 08 and 12.
1317885939079815168 2020-10-19 01:51:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim I don’t know how you can be so unaware that soft votes are usually more delayed in returning their ballots. Like, if you’re like “I’m leaning Biden, but I want to hear more from Trump” you’re not turning in your ballot before the last debate.
1317883006397403137 2020-10-19 01:39:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @RealAPolitics Exactly.

Presidential Politics in the United States is about building an electoral coalition able to win a majority in the electoral college. Also, I have a suspicion that he's doing more than denouncing some random rally and really doesn't like Trump's nationalism itself.

1317628396965384193 2020-10-18 08:47:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou True. And the polls were terrible. TERRIBLE.

1317627839223574529 2020-10-18 08:45:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou If Trump ends up losing, the only thing I can think is that they have gaslit themselves over 2016. But, typically local candidates would be running from the President. With the exception of an awkward McSally comment and typical Susan Collins antics, no sign of that.
1317625405663268864 2020-10-18 08:35:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou You should read about Hoover’s 1932 campaign. Hoover would go campaign and people would just show up to boo and insult him. That’s the kind of defeat these polls are expecting.

There’s way more than Party ID and Party ID is actually the least reliable. For instance, White rural Dems in NC are far more likely to crossover and vote GOP than urban Dems.
1317598737133391872 2020-10-18 06:49:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CatholicUndead @Peter_Nimitz Republicans always do this and then come in later. Democrats are blowing their wad.
1317598599228854272 2020-10-18 06:49:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I should say we will know Florida unless they pull a 2000 and are going to be decided by like 500 votes or something.
1317598021337649153 2020-10-18 06:47:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The vote counting thing has been really overestimated. We will know Florida on election night. If Trump wins Florida and is ahead in rust belt states, I think he’s likely to pick up the states he needs elsewhere. It’s a must win for him, but it really forces Biden into a corner.
1317596974955323395 2020-10-18 06:42:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou We could if ballot returns are lopsided one way or the other and polls have shifted dramatically towards Trump. If it’s Biden+1 in a bunch of swing states, and the early vote looks ok to good for Trump, I’d bet on a Trump win.
1317596064749322240 2020-10-18 06:39:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CatholicUndead @Peter_Nimitz Georgia early vote is not strong for Biden when you incorporate that there's low turnout in the Dem strongholds and that Republicans always win election day voting.
1317595425646444549 2020-10-18 06:36:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FlycatcherSilky I don't pay too much attention to betting markets. There's a lot of people betting on their favorite, sometimes with irrational exuberance and a lot more just herding around conventional wisdom. I do think Trump is undervalued in a lot of states on PredictIt, though.
1317594763969941507 2020-10-18 06:34:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jonas_thelion On election day, which Susquehenna says will be 30% of the overall vote (who knows), Trump should win by about 3:1. That's a 15 point overall margin. Biden edges Trump in the early in-person vote in the same poll. Overall it has Biden+2.
1317593049640427521 2020-10-18 06:27:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jonas_thelion No, that's overall. I think it was wider before, or at least over 50% Democrat. I can cross check North Carolina polling and see what percentage of Trump voters intend to vote in what manner.
1317592837760995333 2020-10-18 06:26:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Miche1T @SelimSeesYou @Pozzidonius1 Yeah, this seems normal. A lot of tourist spots give out "local discounts" too to make it sound more fair.   Russia does kind of suck, though. Depressing place. Of course, that's part of the reason it's crazy we fear them. They're like a sick animal.
1317591647186751490 2020-10-18 06:21:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jonas_thelion 47% registered Dems to 24% registered Republicans. Good news there is that the Republican totals lean more towards first and infrequent voters than Dems. If that trends continues into election day, Republicans should edge out Dems in the final results.
1317590688737992711 2020-10-18 06:17:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NewEra_05 That's what passes for "science" these days and they wonder why more people are skeptical of the whole enterprise.
1317590127129075714 2020-10-18 06:15:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "Scientific realm"  Word games are science.
1317589758068035584 2020-10-18 06:14:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Turnout seems to be picking up a lot of places, but I note it's kind of slow and steady in most places we had a ton of data. Tons of votes on the first day of NC in person voting: about 708K of today's increase is there.
1317588675715358721 2020-10-18 06:09:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Daily turnout update:  Total Early Votes: 22,482,447 Difference: 4,767,389  Youth turnout 7.7-&gt;8.0  Also going to keep track of national first/infrequent from now on: 23.6%.

Might just be a lot of outstanding mail ballots from Covid that will end up coming through.

They need to be rebuked and run a sane candidate and actually talk about the issues.
1317575346980605953 2020-10-18 05:16:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @DanielB94640224 @realikamusume Trump won Chesterfield, if barely. I do think he'd need to improve there. I just don't think he needs to improve much in NoVA, like Loudoun, Fairfax, and Prince William. Just need to pray for low relatively turnout there.
1317573605727850497 2020-10-18 05:10:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @DanielB94640224 @realikamusume I don’t think so. Trump wins by driving up turnout in low turnout WWC areas while holding his own in the suburbs. This is why Trump benefits in a lot of states from high turnout while he doesn’t in heavily suburban states. Virginia has a mix, but suburbs do dominate typically.
1317572910740111366 2020-10-18 05:07:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DanielB94640224 @BrianSh86084519 @realikamusume Checked around: Richmond is also lagging state average. A couple Trump rurals are above average, though and there’s still juice in a lot of these counties if Trump can get more out to the polls.
1317571534366658560 2020-10-18 05:01:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DanielB94640224 @BrianSh86084519 @realikamusume I agree, it’s definitely a long shot, but it is a shot. Worth noting Fairfax early voting lags the state average.

Trump lost 50,000 votes over Romney from 2012-2016, which is rare. I think he will get some of those back and narrow the margin. A lot have probably fled the state, though.

Trivial to get a court to rule to extend the deadling with technical glitches like that.   Now, not saying the technical glitch wasn't on purpose.
1317567731693125632 2020-10-18 04:46:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DanielB94640224 @BrianSh86084519 @realikamusume Virginia 5's Republicans will be bolstered by thousands of Liberty University student who turn out on election day and vote 90-10 straight ticket Republican (10 is being generous to Dems, I believe they got 8% when I voted there).
1317567354444910592 2020-10-18 04:45:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @realikamusume If there's an unexpected avalanche in the South for Trump, it could overwhelm NoVA. It's definitely still possible. Would require a lot of targeted GOTV along I-81, the South, and in Hampton Roads.
1317565436284850176 2020-10-18 04:37:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Colorado is a bit swingier. Virginia’s problem is an incredibly inflexible constituency for the Dems. Long term Republican goal should be civil service reform.
1317563973710073856 2020-10-18 04:31:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Well, and Colorado. Trump has compensated for that by sealing Ohio. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.   West Virginia has always had weird politics like that, though. They seem to be the first to signal a shift in a whole working class swath in the Rust Belt.
1317562618710810624 2020-10-18 04:26:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Obama’s 2008 landslide really obscured a lot of these in play states. People act like the Trump and Bush maps are really different: Once again, beating the dead horse, they are not.  Bush was just poorer and turning out the WWC.

1317556177505558528 2020-10-18 04:00:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @BKudron There’s like zero ballot returns in suburban philly. Given that Republicans are boycotting mail ins in Pennsylvania, it might be a contra-indicator for Republican performance.

1317553514554458114 2020-10-18 03:50:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Hopefully that’s ca. 2028 and the Democrats have moderated themselves.
1317551465381154816 2020-10-18 03:42:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Biden’s campaign doesn’t seem to believe he’s competitive in those states. Loser mentality. All I can say is I hope it’s as good on election night as it appears it might be now.

I'm just saying you don't want to appear to be begging for votes like Biden was last night Michigan. Makes you look desperate. Like some dude who hasn't taken "no" from a girl and is asking her out for the fifth time.

1317548441732567040 2020-10-18 03:30:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is why it's incredibly dumb and possibly desperate for Biden to basically pull out of states like Iowa and Ohio. It can create the narrative that you're a campaign in retreat and that narrative itself might cause losses.
1317548144108994562 2020-10-18 03:28:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Part of the reason Trump even campaigns in what used to be termed "reaches," much to the chagrin of right-wing election pundits, is to generate excitement in the swing states. "Woah, we might get Virginia back, gotta get out and vote and be part of this big victory!"
1317547285916667904 2020-10-18 03:25:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Taliaferro_98 The Silents had a lot of subversives in their ranks. The Greatest lionized JFK to a ridiculous degree. Boomers in the first election they voted in significant numbers (1972) were a huge disappointment for Dems: Splitting only 53-46 for McGovern and barely even showing up.
1317545967596470273 2020-10-18 03:20:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @PerfInjust Yeah, if Trump were elected to the Senate, Mitch McConnell would have to step to the side.
1317545751866675200 2020-10-18 03:19:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Trump isn't driving down turnout when he says "We're going to win Minnesota!" He's actually driving it up because people like casting votes for winners. They don't like showing up to be the desperate last stand of a candidate in trouble.
1317545559717253126 2020-10-18 03:18:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I keep telling people that, if you're not being honest, you want to pretend to be stronger than you really are. People like being on the winning team. Biden coming out and begging people for cash like he's hanging on for dear life might create the very thing they want to avoid.
1317544968345571339 2020-10-18 03:16:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @PerfInjust Not sure his buddy Ron would like that. Challenge Little Marco in the primary? Now that would be hilarious.
1317544046324293634 2020-10-18 03:12:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PerfInjust I think he might just run again in 2024 if it's close.
1317542786791624706 2020-10-18 03:07:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law @NoctRomaRTW There would be someone out there running as "Trump, minus the midnight Tweets" if Trump really had base problems.
1317542567140089857 2020-10-18 03:06:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law @NoctRomaRTW The only time the incumbent loses is when a significant share of the vote goes to the third parties. At least some people don't want to turn to the opposition and look for a more moderate/extreme version of the incumbent. 1992 is a huge case of this.
1317540761840345091 2020-10-18 02:59:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @labor_law_dad @RedEaglePatriot You clearly don’t understand human psychology. People like being part of the winning team. You nearly always want to pretend to be stronger than you really are. I’ve tried to point this out before: No one stays home because their candidate is 10 points ahead. Maybe 50, not 10.
1317540286734753795 2020-10-18 02:57:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Oblivion2elect1 @RedEaglePatriot They wouldn’t be desperate for money if they were ahead by 9 points.
1317491348841398272 2020-10-17 23:43:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Seriously, what is up with folks wearing a mask on a walk or jog? Totally brain dead.
1317462512388931584 2020-10-17 21:48:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK There just aren’t the requests out there for the turnout they need. It doesn’t even have to do with returns, which are bound to be lower than requests.
1317333296808906754 2020-10-17 13:15:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Joe21235278 @ToshJann @Peoples_Pundit @MarketSight Think he was born yesterday. Toddlers aren’t that naive.
1317331027883417600 2020-10-17 13:06:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation They then combined this with Trump’s working class White appeal and that’s how they got all those registrations in the rust belt. Republicans used to be better at this than Dems pre-tech, but Obama did leverage tech better in 2012 and that was part of the margin.
1317325540081192966 2020-10-17 12:44:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV The Republicans have built one of the most impressive get out the vote operations in history. If you’re in a swing state and you’re in a Trump favorable group, your ass is getting dragged to the polls.
1317318570192392192 2020-10-17 12:16:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TRElections If it were up to me, I’d mandate Election Day voting without good reason to vote absentee.
1317318226234277888 2020-10-17 12:15:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TRElections Two reasons:  1. For a lot of people (like me), it’s tradition. It’s just cooler walking in and casting a ballot on election day. 2. Not showing up until Election Day prevents Democrats from knowing how many ballots to print.
1317315673618612224 2020-10-17 12:05:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AkwesiQuan_ @realikamusume They’ve been close since 2000.

1317293091875848194 2020-10-17 10:35:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume It’s like they don’t even point out their own polls.

1317287161406853121 2020-10-17 10:11:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SwampFox8 @realikamusume Delaware I don’t think because he was their Senator once upon a time.

1317259756743122944 2020-10-17 08:22:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 “Threat to democracy.” Threat to their apparently weak hold on power. Normal Americans have lionized the idea of a Trump going to Washington and cleaning house and it’s here and, guess what? The house fights back.
1317259295323455488 2020-10-17 08:21:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They talk about a threat to democracy. The only threat to our democracy is a party trying to obtain total power for their wildly unpopular agenda through fake scandalizing and sensationalism.
1317258741063045121 2020-10-17 08:18:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> How many more of these fake character assassination jobs will we have to see? It has been 5.5 years and we have yet to see the media seriously engage Trump on policy. FIVE AND A HALF YEARS.

1317247779597668352 2020-10-17 07:35:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume There’s going to be a turnout tsunami alright.
1317240195947921410 2020-10-17 07:05:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Michigan Supreme Court is ours. So is the Federal Appellate Court. So is SCOTUS. Their schemes are toast.
1317239630186557441 2020-10-17 07:02:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Dems are going to end up screwed because of this. They’re going to have all these mail ins running around and they’ll need them all into the election office when they have a demotivated base.
1317227331371585536 2020-10-17 06:14:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biden campaign right now:  https://t.co/bjmnfnmgFY
1317225527179157506 2020-10-17 06:06:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jonas_thelion By that, I mean, the fewer Republican votes by election day, the more wildly it will swing Trump. Trump's working class base seems incredibly skeptical of the mail in process in PA and that might lead to veritable tsunami of votes on election day to overcome even that 2.1 million
1317225190921744385 2020-10-17 06:05:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jonas_thelion They have 2.5 weeks and these things tend to pick up. Certainly within the realm of possibility. There is a strong possiblity there will be an even larger than expected dump of Republican votes though. PA may end up contraindicated by mail ins.
1317224741346906112 2020-10-17 06:03:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jonas_thelion Notably, Philly is about a fifth of the mail in vote right now. Allegheny is similarly disproportionate. Dems actually seem to already be running low on potential ballots in their strongholds.
1317223826657300480 2020-10-17 06:00:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jonas_thelion About 700,000 votes returned. About 5:1 Democrat. Notably, Republicans have a much lower return rate right now. Don't know how that will play out.
1317222968494272514 2020-10-17 05:56:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> In Pennsyvlania, I'm guesstimating Biden voters need to cast 1.9-2.1 million ballots by mail to win. There's enough requests out there to do that between Dems and Biden Indies. They'd have to return all of them, though.
1317215470001528833 2020-10-17 05:26:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ellen6019 I'm just trying to keep track of turnout to see if we can detect some massive turnout jump. Right now I'm not seeing it, but this election is so weird we don't know. I think we will learn a lot next week, though.
1317214992727461889 2020-10-17 05:25:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Also, about a third of the increase is from Texas alone. Another half a million from California. Aside from AZ and NV, the daily increases appear steady in battleground states.
1317214507249401857 2020-10-17 05:23:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Daily Turnout Update:   Total EV Turnout: 17,715,058 Daily Increase: 3,984,319  Youth turnout: 7.4-7.7  This is not apples to apples. Four new states started reporting, including Illinois (3 Blue last election: HI, IL, OR and 1 Red: KS). 687,078 between the three.

1317193869356912640 2020-10-17 04:01:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Second debate is supposed to be foreign policy.
1317193452568928256 2020-10-17 03:59:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Yeoman360 @JayFiveK Sasse is one of those Midwest Evangelicals that genuinely buys the idea Trump is just too immoral to be President and he has adopted this to the point of aiding his mortal enemies in the process. Truly a tale of foolishness.
1317155234838347777 2020-10-17 01:27:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume People trust Donald Trump. This man commands his base in a way only Obama could compete with and even then, I doubt it.
1317154967996796932 2020-10-17 01:26:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume We’re getting really divergent returns in states depending on whether Republicans trust local election officials. We can even see this within states in county by county Florida results.
1317147553926946823 2020-10-17 00:57:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer What "principles" is this guy talking about?   Of all the politicians to talk about "principles" we're going to ask the guy who was pro-choice, then pro-life, created Romneycare and then ran against the Obama version of it? This man strains credulity.
1317137405229621248 2020-10-17 00:16:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Donald Trump has opinions about the attractiveness of women. How dare he! Totally disqualifying!
1317108977046618115 2020-10-16 22:23:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They tried really hard, but Trump still won the game.
1317105357198675970 2020-10-16 22:09:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> How many times do we have to hear that "hospitals are running out of room!" and have it not happen before we just stop believing it?
1317103592147456002 2020-10-16 22:02:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee @vrtester @ZyclownB @OpinionsMiOwn @love_whiteppl @NoTatsClassy @realDonaldTrump People expected way too much. I knew it would be difficult when the Senate ended up being 52-48 and Trump lost the popular vote. Just wasn't the political capital and a shutdown showdown with your own party is a really bad look.
1317102295407087616 2020-10-16 21:57:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee @vrtester @ZyclownB @OpinionsMiOwn @love_whiteppl @NoTatsClassy @realDonaldTrump Why are so many of the right wing criticisms of the Trump agenda post-election the same as the shitlib objections before? So odd.
1316979912344043520 2020-10-16 13:50:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot These people think if Dems finagle their way into stealing an election, it’s theirs forever.

1316965879415013379 2020-10-16 12:55:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou There’s a lot of Hispanic indies in Florida too, so GOP’s percentage is much lower. Those Hispanic Indies typically break Republican, but they will occasionally swing wildly for the Democrats.
1316959658008076288 2020-10-16 12:30:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 Some older people don't seem to know. Like, you talk to these people and it's like they forgot they opposed gay marriage a few years ago.  Think about this: Trump announced his campaign before the Obergefell decision, cementing gay marriage in every state of the union.
1316959136320524289 2020-10-16 12:28:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BibMccafferty @SelimSeesYou True. I'm just thinking against Trump, though.
1316958449679405057 2020-10-16 12:25:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BibMccafferty @SelimSeesYou Bernie would have been a great person to humiliate.
1316957621270831110 2020-10-16 12:22:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I remember it being talked about at the time. I was off Twitter, but it was rather obvious what was going on.   Now, I don't think it was good will towards Joe Biden on the part of Obama. It was just obvious only Joe could possibly beat Bernie after the Nevada Caucus.
1316956198613229571 2020-10-16 12:16:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LibertarianGC The reason Clinton was able to get a second term was, ironically, the Republicans taking the House for the first time in forever in 1994.
1316955857196810240 2020-10-16 12:15:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LibertarianGC Democrats did suck because they were far too liberal for the nation as a whole. This had been the case since the Johnson Admin really and still is in some respects. Carter himself ran as a moderate and lost because he governed left of the country. Clinton only won as a moderate.
1316954947347488769 2020-10-16 12:11:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LibertarianGC There will definitely come a point when people want a calmer, steadier hand in charge. I don't think that's yet, though.
1316953319605260288 2020-10-16 12:05:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LibertarianGC 1988 was very much a latter type of election. People liked Reagan. They didn't want anything to change fundamentally with the way Reagan did things.
1316953147076640769 2020-10-16 12:04:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LibertarianGC 1976 featured two meh candidates and Carter was arguably the one who was slightly less meh. I do think this can change quickly. People vote for meh candidates when they like the policies they live under and just want them to continue. If Trump wins, Pence can pulls this off.

1316946912935903232 2020-10-16 11:39:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WI_Forward @ryano3232_ryan @RealAPolitics Ask your friends at TargetSmart (a Democrat firm) why they're doing that then. They don't release this information to the public, but people with access to the voter file know it.
1316945415913263105 2020-10-16 11:33:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnnysobieski Like I said, same, but we at least have to try. Lots of harm can be done to these hostile institutions by the mere act of delivering Trump a victory.
1316944796750143489 2020-10-16 11:31:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is the path forward if we vote Biden. I'm not sure all the king's horses and all the king's men can prevent this dystopian future at this point, but we at least have to try.
1316943601511825412 2020-10-16 11:26:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @labor_law_dad @dpr1000 @RedEaglePatriot No. NPAs skew differently depending on state and NPAs typically skew towards Republicans in Florida.
1316942146935672838 2020-10-16 11:20:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim If they vote, they almost certainly lean GOP these days. These are the type of people who liked both Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich. Trump rode a lot of that anti-establishment angst into the White House.
1316941530398183424 2020-10-16 11:18:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK "Quick, we're going to make our guy look like he's really passionate about policy despite not having any unique proposals."

1316937976354660355 2020-10-16 11:04:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim I'm old enough to remember when most anti-vax types were civil libertarians who leaned Democrat. Democrats have just totally abandoned those people. Not sure how many of them there really are, though.   Also, I'm not taking any rona vaccine period.
1316937058783531009 2020-10-16 11:00:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Joe Biden feels so much like the Democrat Mitt Romney it’s ridiculous. Both nominated on the theory that their opponent is so bad you want to nominate a generic elephant/donkey to not offend anyone.
1316936449254711296 2020-10-16 10:58:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba But the science says Orange Man Bad. Vote Generic Democrat to replace Orange Man.
1316935948958109696 2020-10-16 10:56:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pabloplato @DirkRecker7676 @realikamusume Trump got 2,000 less votes because he regressed in the suburbs. The theory is that Trump is going to recover a lot of those margins in the WOW counties and get enough of his 2016 base in the state to combine for the win.
1316935103206096898 2020-10-16 10:52:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @GanleyShah New Hampshire is probably the most difficult state to predict. They are incredibly independent minded up there.
1316934502942429184 2020-10-16 10:50:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GanleyShah @realikamusume NH registrations aren’t a great corollary though because a lot comes from the primary.
1316932822171590657 2020-10-16 10:43:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @realikamusume To be fair, how much of that 63% was cash for ballots?
1316932674389483520 2020-10-16 10:43:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Miche1T @realikamusume St. Louis County with Duluth is the heart of the Iron Range.
1316932009499987968 2020-10-16 10:40:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume From what I’ve seen, they could actually lag in turnout compared to 2016. Trump’s machine is going to drag a ton of voters out of the woods to vote for him and there just aren’t any left MSP with the Iron Range flipping as well.
1316930704446492673 2020-10-16 10:35:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume St. Louis is going to flip. Only thing that can save them is increased suburban MSP intensity and will we really see that after the riots?
1316929326437236737 2020-10-16 10:29:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiahgameking2 It was really dumb of them to nominate her. The traditional Lolbert Nominee is an upper middle class White guy with an autistic, ideological bent. She does alienate a lot of those old school lolberts.
1316928799901126656 2020-10-16 10:27:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiahgameking2 I just don’t think his base is going to care about the Platinum Plan. There’s every sign of increased intensity among working class men from what data we do have.
1316928538734452739 2020-10-16 10:26:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiahgameking2 I think she’ll be above average just because there’s still a certain demographic that hates Trump, but can never vote Democrat.
1316927051132260353 2020-10-16 10:20:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiahgameking2 Johnson himself ended up being a Trump vote parker for the most part. I can’t imagine Jorgenson ends up with any more than half of Johnson’s total.
1316919957905702916 2020-10-16 09:52:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BCLive5 @CrankyFed @JBFalke All true. I can’t imagine trying to hike a leg in an adrenaline driven scenario where your life is actually in danger.
1316915591828164612 2020-10-16 09:35:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed @JBFalke I say this because some people think if you so much as draw your weapon you need to shoot until they’re dead, which isn’t exactly true.
1316915284565962758 2020-10-16 09:34:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed @JBFalke The general advice is if you’re shooting, you better have a defensible reason they need to be dead. Doesn’t means it’s illegal not to kill them.
1316914207732961282 2020-10-16 09:29:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JBFalke So you’re a monarchist? Good show.
1316914003617218562 2020-10-16 09:29:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot @NilesJasper They didn’t like Romney in 2012. There’s always random ideology switchers.

1316903765891600385 2020-10-16 08:48:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky It started in North Carolina today.

1316903175396478978 2020-10-16 08:45:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon True, but by that same token it’s silly to dismiss that Trump ends up with a larger EV win by carrying MN and NV.
1316902753902395393 2020-10-16 08:44:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Nothing we didn’t already know. There was a new email though.
1316902600051167232 2020-10-16 08:43:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 2012 was one of very few elections where the incumbent regressed in his re-election attempt. One of the others was 1916 and 1912 was bizarre and another 1940.
1316901778747756547 2020-10-16 08:40:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I can’t believe they’re still trying to get on Trump for having a mortgage.

1316899192481120256 2020-10-16 08:30:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Is it really that bad?
1316898601155645440 2020-10-16 08:27:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The FCC exists, dude.
1316897747006590978 2020-10-16 08:24:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Remember that early interview where he got the reporter to laugh?
1316897285977014275 2020-10-16 08:22:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume This is how Trump broke out in the primaries: These types of exchanges. I think they forgot that.
1316894005502803968 2020-10-16 08:09:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf Republicans in PA are basically boycotting mail ins. Same is true in Florida to a lesser degree.
1316893837852315648 2020-10-16 08:08:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So what I’m getting out of this is that the past 6 years of terrible American foreign policy towards Russia have been caused by Biden’s personal graft? I wish I could say I was surprised.
1316891987547705344 2020-10-16 08:01:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I honestly think he’s just low T.
1316890887452934144 2020-10-16 07:57:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @davidchapman141 They never address the actual issue. Even if it was Russia who dug it up: is it true or not?

1316890053986013184 2020-10-16 07:53:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @SelimSeesYou They're like "screw you guys, we'll take our 30 pieces, thanks Donald."
1316889596802850818 2020-10-16 07:52:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK "Bro, you gotta get out there and vote!"
1316887489953599488 2020-10-16 07:43:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 That's a good point and one reason I assume that the youth vote will pick up to at least 15% when it's all set and done. However, knowing some of these youth lefties types, they're as irrationally afraid of the rona as their grandparents.
1316886306413301761 2020-10-16 07:38:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 Because of their attempted mass mail in scam, Dems are running out of time. I'll be more optimistic if these trends continue into next week. Could be in for a shockingly low turnout election if the Dems send out all these mail ins and they return at these rates.
1316886173000830976 2020-10-16 07:38:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NotABotHeh @RyanGirdusky 58% registered Dem to 22% Republican. Republicans are actually outperforming their share of registered voters.
1316885193970622468 2020-10-16 07:34:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NotABotHeh @RyanGirdusky That's why Republicans aren't turning in mail ins. Especially true in Democrat counties. Republicans are doing well in counties where the local Republicans are in charge of the County Government.
1316884781179805698 2020-10-16 07:32:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NotABotHeh @RyanGirdusky Yes, but not as severely. Record numbers of Republican in Florida report not trusting mail ins. Honestly, Republicans are doing well in Florida. Most of the Dem vote is old Super Voters (people who voted for Hillary Clinton 4 years ago).
1316884576715890697 2020-10-16 07:32:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The doomer is right in time with out of context data!
1316884485582036994 2020-10-16 07:31:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NotABotHeh @RyanGirdusky Way more of the Democrat vote is in. Pennsylvania Republicans are boycotting mail in voting.
1316883993669894144 2020-10-16 07:29:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 I was actually impressed how low it was. Assuming youth vote creeps up by .2% everyday from now until the election (HUGE assumption), we're talking 11-12% youth turnout. That's so low I'm assuming it picks up.
1316883721186836480 2020-10-16 07:28:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried @realikamusume Spoiler: Dems are doing even worse today.
1316882761534312448 2020-10-16 07:24:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Total Early Vote Today: 13730739 Total Early Vote Yesterday: 12081046 Increase: 1,522,635  Youth vote (18-29): 7.2% -&gt; 7.4%
1316881684562849792 2020-10-16 07:20:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Twitter's back and in time for my daily turnout update!
1316849869659799554 2020-10-16 05:14:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 @thehangingchads Nationally, there just aren't the requests to match the idea of a Dem voter surge if polling is any indicator.
1316849735752392706 2020-10-16 05:13:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 @thehangingchads Exactly. The requests is the main problem. Also, the GOP haven't returned their ballots as fast as the Dems. Not an indication they won't vote, though.
1316849038579445761 2020-10-16 05:10:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 @thehangingchads They were pretty good. Pointing out Biden needs like 40 point leads in mail in voting to even stand a chance in PA.
1316848314051112963 2020-10-16 05:07:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 @thehangingchads Exactly. There's just no evidence of this massive turnout surge. I'm convinced Dem returns are going to start SLOWING too. I think they need 40 million Biden votes nationally before polls even open on Election Day to have a prayer.
1316847405464276992 2020-10-16 05:04:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @CarlStein1984 They're all high on these early vote numbers and it really just feels like straw. So much of this are older super voters that you know voted Clinton in 2016. Yes, old female Democrats are excited to rebuke Trump. Who cares?
1316844923413508096 2020-10-16 04:54:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads If people still buy this crap after this election, I'm out.
1316842987280912386 2020-10-16 04:46:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @RedEaglePatriot ...Trump's platform was never as economically populist as people suggest. On that front, he basically just didn't care about pretending to want to reform the welfare state significantly. His populist points were on trade and immigration and those should be accomplished.
1316842573403750402 2020-10-16 04:45:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @RedEaglePatriot He doesn't, but that doesn't mean he has bad politics. Trump's policies are a lot more popular than his person, so there is a certain class of voter that Pence will get and he'll just have to convince the WWC he will continue Trump's policies....
1316840654585069570 2020-10-16 04:37:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @RedEaglePatriot Nikki Haley will never be the Presidential nominee of the Republican Party. Pence will be it in 2024 and he'll run as Trump's third term. That should be enough to motivate these voters and he should reclaim some of the suburban types.
1316839318955196417 2020-10-16 04:32:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @RedEaglePatriot Trump's populism isn't going anywhere and this is a long term realignment that has been occurring. It started in West Virginia and will likely reach into the Iron Range this election. Reminder that Bush nearly won all these states: Just didn't drive turnout high enough.
1316837449675530240 2020-10-16 04:24:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot We could see an intensification of the realignment that has been occurring since the mid-2000s as the Republicans gain strength in the Upper Midwest among WWC and lose strength among suburban Whites in the South. This could change margins significantly.
1316831056658599937 2020-10-16 03:59:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright @TeamTrump Karl Rove texted....geez this guy want me to vote for Biden?
1316830879281491969 2020-10-16 03:58:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Super_Lutheran He asked Scaramucci if he should respond to the Trump campaign. They were clearly collaborating with Team Biden.

1316827727513690113 2020-10-16 03:46:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Seriously, getting like 10+ texts a day. Maybe even more.
1316827607963439104 2020-10-16 03:45:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Look, I want to win too, but I'm tapped out on the donations @realDonaldTrump.
1316826952209256448 2020-10-16 03:43:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Gotta take the small wins.
1316825703376060417 2020-10-16 03:38:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed That's pretty based there.
1316822007049334784 2020-10-16 03:23:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed True masculine conservatism is....slaughtering children.  https://t.co/Empi1CMWq1
1316814910907731969 2020-10-16 02:55:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnnysobieski You know it takes months by law to issue a ruling like this, right? Like, there's no way around it. It's pretty clear with the events of the past week, especially Justice Thomas's opinion, there's momentum to change the way this is handled.
1316809905928499201 2020-10-16 02:35:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CaesarSalad99 @jcbonthedl I know people who have hitch hiked cross country to be homeless in California
1316808422868877313 2020-10-16 02:29:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's just bizarre they won't even consider this.
1316807754452004872 2020-10-16 02:26:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Maybe the race is just about 6 points right of where the average is and Trafalgar's superior methodology picks up on that.
1316790426830073858 2020-10-16 01:17:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NilesJasper @realikamusume Which is why St. Louis County is interesting: They actually got a decent sample there in a county that hasn't voted for a Republican since Herbert Hoover.
1316790077226471424 2020-10-16 01:16:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NilesJasper @realikamusume It feels like they got their lopsided numbers by calling like one person in a bunch of red counties who happened to vote Biden. In very strong, populous red counties it's tougher to hide the lean.
1316789350823329793 2020-10-16 01:13:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @bestgtor88 @CottoGottfried That's why I'm tracking daily shifts. It really feels like we just got a bunch of old Democrats who returned ballots really quick and it seems to be dropping off a bit. Don't expect to see a huge GOP uptick, though, due to voting intention. At least not until in person voting.
1316788123943174147 2020-10-16 01:08:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @bestgtor88 @CottoGottfried I wouldn't worry too much about it. Still skews heavily old. And, notably, despite their head start they are slightly below average in returns: 20.1% in Broward, 20.2% statewide. Collier is at a third and leans Republican.
1316787398207049736 2020-10-16 01:05:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @bestgtor88 @CottoGottfried It was one or two. Right now Dems are at about a fifth of their 2016 vote total: 105,811 to 553,320. GOP's at about a tenth of theirs in the county: 27,117.
1316786217493684224 2020-10-16 01:01:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Heay, @realDonaldTrump, get on this now! The people demand it!
1316785757055578112 2020-10-16 00:59:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @CottoGottfried Of course, Collier and Lee County are full of retired supervoters. Of more interest are places like Broward and Palm Beach.
1316785516331905025 2020-10-16 00:58:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @CottoGottfried Yeah, should clarify, what I mean is that I want the numbers to lean towards super and frequent voters. Much over 80% and you’re just going to have a lot of infrequent voters in there.
1316785177834774528 2020-10-16 00:57:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @davidchapman141 Low follower count doomers with few, if any tweets equals instablock. Don’t mind people trying to get an accurate picture of the election with all the disinfo out there, but not bots or near bots.
1316783286291759107 2020-10-16 00:49:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried The pace still needs to slow. It's not good if 80+% of Dems return their ballots.
1316782281802027009 2020-10-16 00:45:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics @CoreyPa99610050 They also have a relationship that goes way back to the beginning of RCP.
1316781836174012416 2020-10-16 00:43:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Like I was pointing out yesterday: This is an issue we have regulatory precedent on. It's not like we'd be in totally uncharted waters to declare social media a regulated medium and apply telecom laws to it.
1316781520020033542 2020-10-16 00:42:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Seeing a lot of people down on the prospects of regulating big tech. On the contrary, there's now a clear and direct cause for doing so and, should Republicans win the election, they will have ample political capital to start cracking down.
1316780959841374209 2020-10-16 00:40:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @VanCoullin Negra is much better than Especial IMO. I think that's a pretty broad consensus.
1316775106165776384 2020-10-16 00:17:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @realikamusume Barnes has Trump at 25% working black male support in PA. That’s basically the black demo in the South.
1316774832965660672 2020-10-16 00:15:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trex9045 @realikamusume Given their campaign actions, it seems they are acting like they believe it. They do not seem to be cruising for a blowout all chill.
1316773855067860993 2020-10-16 00:12:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume That Charleston sample is way too blue. You’d get the impression it is as lopsided as Queens or something and last election it was 50-42.
1316770048686645248 2020-10-15 23:56:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @Oblivion2elect1 @WC_Fox I recorded their totals for D and R first time and infrequent voters to see what they show. Those should be harder to model in the first place. Radical shifts there would be odd.
1316768767461003268 2020-10-15 23:51:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WickedTewi @Hakasays @realikamusume Nationally it’s about 50-30. Dems trailing their predicted share by some margin.
1316766031793328130 2020-10-15 23:41:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @KingFrenly When the economy doesn't run on fossil fuels, then we can move on as they'll just be a giant sand trap at that point. Until, then, though, it's desirable to stay friends.
1316765100951379974 2020-10-15 23:37:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just want to remind my fellow dissident rightists that the friend-enemy distinction isn't *supposed* to apply to the different political factions in a functioning democracy. Probably inevitable it will at some point, but it isn't *supposed* to be this way.
1316763891595202561 2020-10-15 23:32:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly KSA and Israel are friends, but, yes, it's more important to be friends with the Saudis than the Israelis. The oil they control is vital to the world economy.
1316763587080343554 2020-10-15 23:31:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @KingFrenly Saudi Arabia is like the feds for Islamists. They provide support and then tell America about it if they think they're going to attack America.
1316762181749346305 2020-10-15 23:25:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @groyper_boston @CitadelMark @ScottMGreer Infiltrating institutions is a long game and they're really cracking down on right-wing entryism.
1316761061715046400 2020-10-15 23:21:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @groyper_boston @CitadelMark @ScottMGreer Don't discount change in behavior over time. *If* (it's a big one) conservatives can reform or destroy hostile institutions over the next decade, young people will reform their behaviors over time.
1316760714527215616 2020-10-15 23:19:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed The term "sophomoric" is a term for a reason.
1316754349549379584 2020-10-15 22:54:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer I think the meme comes from Gen Z right wing kids being more right wing.   I always take this with a grain of salt. They say these things, then don't vote and when they start voting they start voting like their parents (mostly).
1316750914271797249 2020-10-15 22:40:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> How irresponsible of the Biden camp. Clearly they should have completely prevented themselves from catching a respiratory illness through magical barriers.
1316615907108630529 2020-10-15 13:44:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CaribouXLou @SelimSeesYou They reported that Biden had Covid. I fell for it.
1316615453062705152 2020-10-15 13:42:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReformedMallard @mccarthywzright Crap.
1316607347205312514 2020-10-15 13:10:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ArchibaldLewis5 I wouldn’t put it past them, but it’s really interesting when you see numbers like this.
1316604837623222272 2020-10-15 13:00:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Either people are looking for an excuse not to vote for Trump or, alternatively, an excuse to vote for him and who really knows why either way.
1316603619094016003 2020-10-15 12:55:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So many of these numbers add up like this and you're just left shaking your head about how people are saying they're going to vote for Biden. Only halfway reasonable answer is "cuz Covid."
1316603003479232512 2020-10-15 12:53:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago The odds of that are so close to zero (well below 1/1500) and that *could* happen to Dems too.
1316599681099739137 2020-10-15 12:39:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago I think, strictly speaking, an absolute best case for Trump he gets at least Virginia and Oregon (absolute best case maybe even more), that is if we're going to include Kansas, Missouri, and Alaska for Biden.  I think MN flips right now. Too early to tell, though.
1316596962054017024 2020-10-15 12:29:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 15% of requested early/mail in ballots are from 18-29s. This includes California's 19% (everyone's getting one). So, if everyone 18-29 returns their ballots and they don't represent a disproportionate surge on election day, they'd still fall well short of 2016 numbers.
1316591153089781760 2020-10-15 12:06:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jondutoit The twenty second amendment was a bad idea and an overreaction to FDR anyway (FDR survived mostly through momentum in his second two terms).
1316590401588023297 2020-10-15 12:03:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Tmoneyhoops I'm not from Indiana and don't follow college basketball and I thought of this, but couldn't remember the name. Thank you!
1316589557891174400 2020-10-15 11:59:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ded_ruckus They should blame ACB's predecessor. She's the one who came up with this idea that you should do this in a Senate hearing because not even a Dem Senate would have approved that witch when she was nominated.
1316587459174694915 2020-10-15 11:51:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Some new party called Advance New Zealand. Apparently dedicated to covid skepticism of some type.
1316587141858816000 2020-10-15 11:50:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads New Zealand First? Can't imagine it's the Nationals or Labour.
1316586575346782208 2020-10-15 11:47:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou But they'll point out how evil it is a 5% surge in WWC turnout can do the same for Trump.
1316586292105351168 2020-10-15 11:46:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PrimetimePurity @politidummy_ In the post-9/11 era, yes, yes it is.
1316586066367991809 2020-10-15 11:45:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @diegodiasgarcia @RedEaglePatriot Democrats don't try to fool themselves when they conduct an internal poll.
1316584620880789505 2020-10-15 11:40:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp That's basically what the FCC has done with TV and radio. I'd just copy paste them and take the time to codify it into statute as some of what the FCC does is purely regulatory and can be changed at their whim.
1316584327178747904 2020-10-15 11:38:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CatholicEcon I think Thomas was right about Section 230, which is why I think we need a bigger solution. There are a lot of pitfalls about removing this protection. However, with protection should come responsibility.
1316583833408598019 2020-10-15 11:37:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Perfectly reasonable to regulate a site like Twitter or Facebook the way we do radio: The only restriction on these platforms should should be the same decency standards we apply to those platforms.
1316578076017537025 2020-10-15 11:14:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp The 14th Amendment is definitely the problem. It's just so vague that it ends up applying things that were probably never meant to be applied through it.
1316576917773053952 2020-10-15 11:09:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Oh no, maybe we let some states do some different things. The horror! If it's so horrible, won't people just leave? This is what could have been the beauty of America: If you wanted to go be a degenerate sinner, you could just move to another state that allowed that like Nevada.
1316575459338059776 2020-10-15 11:03:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @HeritageNLegacy Why do we care why some people rape? This is Twitter, not some psych journal.
1316574077541330944 2020-10-15 10:58:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Also will keep track of the youth vote percentage, which stand at 7.2%. For the record, yesterday was at 10.7 million. Today is at 12.1. This will pickup. We lack data on states that cast 28.6 million votes in 2016 (7 R, 5 D), or approximately 21% of the vote.
1316571047169273856 2020-10-15 10:46:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm going to try to keep track of the daily increase of the national early vote. See if we can pick up on a huge turnout surge nationally.
1316564803234734080 2020-10-15 10:21:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TRElections @realikamusume Biden was a liberal Senator from a neighboring state. I don't think people in Chester County fondly remember Uncle Joe from his days as Delaware's Senator. Most likely it's awash, but might hurt him among a certain breed of Chester NeverTrump Republican.
1316564199707942912 2020-10-15 10:19:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnDoe22628416 @CottoGottfried @NoctRomaRTW Just saying that given the fact we're expecting Republicans to vote disproportionately on election day, these states were heading for double digit Trump landslides. Is that really what we'll see? Seems unlikely.
1316558415393628161 2020-10-15 09:56:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried @NoctRomaRTW It really did seem like Republicans were doing much better there than would be expected.

1316555146927710208 2020-10-15 09:43:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JBFalke I just find it fitting that New Jersey, the most "meh" state in the Union, likes the most "meh" fast food chain.

1316554577760706561 2020-10-15 09:40:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat 14th Amendment is a two way street on this for now. Most states have pretty strong versions of a Second Amendment as well, often stronger than the Federal Constitution. Also, the second amendment codifies an ancient practice of the Anglo-Saxon people no legislature can repeal.
1316554034472529924 2020-10-15 09:38:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume They're really counting on that helping him in the Philly burbs. If anything, I think it might end up being a drag.
1316553568888016896 2020-10-15 09:36:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TiddieChvmper2 Checked out Dick's: It's even worse than Burgerville. They aren't even on the other side of Lake Washington from Seattle.

1316551698408714240 2020-10-15 09:29:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks Arizona, Utah, and the DFW aren't bad. I think they're expanding into Oklahoma in the near future.

1316551290005196805 2020-10-15 09:27:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TiddieChvmper2 I lived in Washington and don't even know what Dick's is.   Burgerville exists from Longview/Kelso, Washington down to Eugene. So, if you lived somewhere else, you would have seen it. And it sucks, so not worth going to when you have to go to the city.
1316550809870569473 2020-10-15 09:25:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks It's called In-N-Out, right down to the Baptist owners. In-N-Out I think even cucks less.
1316550300615020544 2020-10-15 09:23:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Burgerville sucks, btw.

1316493852153458693 2020-10-15 05:39:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I really want to see Minnesota vote Trump.   Note about MN early vote turnout: It's modeled, not registered, party and there have definitely been a ton of flips in the Iron Range that will look like they're Dems, but they're actually voting Trump.

This is the same thing that was done with all the Clinton scandals in 2016: They would never deny the truth of the allegation. They'd just question how sources were obtained. This isn't a two way street either.

1316442132157206534 2020-10-15 02:13:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ShapiroBenjamin @SelimSeesYou They still need a registered voter and a ballot with a signature to get this stuff counted.
1316442019208757254 2020-10-15 02:13:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ShapiroBenjamin @SelimSeesYou Mail in balloting is vulnerable, but Republicans have armed themselves with a lot of lawyers to fight this in key states. Dem canvassing ops are basically nonexistent as a gamble to spread Covid fear (without Covid, this would NOT be a race), so it will be difficult for them.
1316440752721928193 2020-10-15 02:08:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ShapiroBenjamin @SelimSeesYou There's only so much rigging you can do in the urban cores. Dems are hoping they can expand their operations to the suburbs. We will see if it works.
1316435174280790023 2020-10-15 01:46:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Biden's family corruption is corruption because of Joe Biden. There's plenty of evidence here he uses his political positions to advantage his deadbeat son. Hunter Biden is just what happens when you're a spoiled brat and is evidence of Biden's corruption.

1316429211700285443 2020-10-15 01:22:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> In the desperate final act of the “NotTrump” campaign, Dems frighten their own voters away from the Election Day polls cuz “second wave” Covid.
1316425056193572871 2020-10-15 01:06:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Note: Especially in Florida because Florida doesn’t really have the same type of suburbs as the rest of the country.
1316424821375467524 2020-10-15 01:05:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Given the Cuban support surge and assuming Trump retains his WWC base, I don’t see how Trump’s victory is as narrow as a lot of people think it will be. This seems more likely. Unless Trump’s support just collapses in the suburbs, but I’m convinced that will be marginal.
1316420263202914305 2020-10-15 00:47:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They're trying to meme this second wave, but death rates are so far down. Is this really how we're going to determine the President for the next four years? We're going to vote for a corrupt old man because of a disease whose death rates are collapsing?
1316419586238091267 2020-10-15 00:44:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Bush at one point had like 20% approvals. Half the GOP hated him. That half was Trump's base in the 2016 primaries.
1316419394201845762 2020-10-15 00:43:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump's message at this townhall tomorrow should be "Trust me to the build the economy that comes after Covid."  Biden's message is incredibly fleeting. Covid will go away eventually. Are you really going to vote for Biden over this?

They keep bringing up this 500 billion to black businesses packages. Like, it is unconstitutional to pass a law that gives money to a specific race over others and a 6-3 court will not overturn that. Not even Roberts is that dull.

1316385898603442178 2020-10-14 22:30:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim This dude is just a total blackpiller who doesn't even understand the Trump base as much as he thinks.

1316375997437153280 2020-10-14 21:51:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @realikamusume There's just so much third party vote parking and "undecideds" even in these Baris and Trafalgar polls. Convinced tons of these people will vote Trump at the end of the day.

1316242448021172224 2020-10-14 13:00:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical @CottoGottfried He would have lost 2012 against a competent opponent. Even New Gingrich probably could have eked by in Virginia, Ohio, Florida and Nevada that year to squeak an EV win.

1316238102441218048 2020-10-14 12:43:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot If Trump wins, but gets less than 280 EVs, Arizona will be the tipping point.

1316234138647695360 2020-10-14 12:27:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Pennsylvania in particular has a very strong voter registration correlation in presidential elections.
1316233445312520194 2020-10-14 12:24:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Arizona and Nevada are going to make interesting case studies because of the traditional large percentage of mail in votes anyway.

1316223621002657793 2020-10-14 11:45:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Been saying this for years: Democrats complain about gerrymandering, but they gerrymander themselves. Don’t need to gerrymander when they shove themselves into a few square miles. Want to see real gerrymandering? Look at what Maryland has to do to get their Dem numbers.

1316218943175045121 2020-10-14 11:27:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago I’m certainly not counting on Illinois to deliver the 270th electoral vote if that’s what you mean.
1316217916241649666 2020-10-14 11:23:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago I think Illinois is going to long term trend back towards Republicans and this might be the first election we start seeing it to a significant degree.
1316216921025646592 2020-10-14 11:19:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago Unfortunately no IL info yet. There were two polls putting Trump only 15 points behind or so.

1316210486661312512 2020-10-14 10:53:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried Clinton got 61.7%. Trump 31.6%. I think both sides will improve on these numbers.

He will almost certainly get more raw votes this time.

1316201022684041216 2020-10-14 10:15:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation On the Republican side, we have a man from South Dakota named John Thune. Incredibly boring. Too bad Larry Pressler  didn't get any traction to take his old seat back in 2014: He was MAGA before MAGA was cool (old school GOP protectionist and wanted US out of Europe).
1316198933568389120 2020-10-14 10:07:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WesleyPrimrose I think Republicans just aren't going to turn out in Pennsylvania until election day because of the court fight: None of them trust it.
1316198234893713409 2020-10-14 10:04:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CATNAPPER2020 Just checked: Harris County's early vote is more Republican this year than in 2016 and, notably, more of the first time and infrequent voters are projected to be Republican.
1316197217431101440 2020-10-14 10:00:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DirkRecker7676 @CottoGottfried That is something to consider: With all these Strip employees leaving the state and the all mail in election, probably can't trust Clark County. Of note, returns in Clark County are very low so far.
1316194240712638464 2020-10-14 09:48:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried Only poll in California recently tacked Trump at 28%. For the record, I think the final tally in California will be 9-10 million for Biden (probably closer to 10), 5 million for Trump.
1316193716953116677 2020-10-14 09:46:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @CottoGottfried Considering Nevada is all mail in, it is an interesting test case. Not enough is in yet for us to know much, though. Hopefully it bodes well for election day voting in the battlegrounds.
1316193245890777094 2020-10-14 09:44:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @CottoGottfried Was just looking at Nevada early vote: The Republican vote leans more towards infrequent and first time voters than the Dems. Republicans are banking more unreliable voters in Nevada than the Democrats.
1316191348811235331 2020-10-14 09:37:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Nationally, the youth vote is at 7%. That's being buoyed in irrelevant California at 9.6%. It is high compared to the national average in PA and MN too: 8.5% and 9.1% respectively. WI and MI have abysmal youth votes so far.
1316190226658754560 2020-10-14 09:32:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Doing even more digging on the national early vote so far:  Democrats: Super+Likely voters: 78.2% First+Infrequent: 21.8%  Republicans: Super+Likely: 79.3% First+Infrequent: 20.7%  Not some stunning number from Democrats considering how much they've pushed mail in voting.

1316184278737223683 2020-10-14 09:09:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CEOofBarron @SelimSeesYou We have data on this: The vote skews heavily old and high propensity.
1316183930173784066 2020-10-14 09:07:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The early vote is all old super voters. These people have all voted before. New voters are incredibly marginal. Infrequent voters are also a much lower share than 2016.
1316183391331667969 2020-10-14 09:05:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Well, and a little bit of help from one Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

1316151649774247938 2020-10-14 06:59:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot They're correct this time, we swear!
1316150972918398976 2020-10-14 06:56:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Can't find the original article from 2018, but they mention it in their press release for this year's data:  https://t.co/dzk2DfSwY9
1316150861635223552 2020-10-14 06:56:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed TargetSmart (where I'm getting all this info because it's the easiest to get) did some study on it because of 2016: Insofar as you're getting super and frequent voters out, you're mostly just banking votes that already would have been cast, especially in Presidential years.
1316149081501315074 2020-10-14 06:49:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Jeb Bush engendered more excitement and loyalty.
1316147533350162432 2020-10-14 06:43:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dems are obviously just cannibalizing so much of their later vote in PA it's almost funny. The vast majority of the votes in so far are in heavily Democrat counties. It's old super voters in urban cores driving this.
1316144480081281025 2020-10-14 06:31:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Enjoy life. Vote Trump.
1316141009663918081 2020-10-14 06:17:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim How does Trump lose one point in the head to head? That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
1316139237574684672 2020-10-14 06:10:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK The fact this woman is still in charge of House Dems after 18 years is disgusting.
1316138574920720384 2020-10-14 06:07:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation Conservatives support conserving the fundamental laws of the land unless duly considered and passed with a broad consensus: Shocking!
1316136404712337408 2020-10-14 05:59:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> In Pennsylvania, the Republican vote leans more towards less frequent voters than the Democrat vote so far. Unaffiliateds lean heavily towards low participation.
1316133741320974345 2020-10-14 05:48:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Excuse me, all four besides DC are pretty close to flipping, though New England would need half their judges to retire to totally flip.
1316133530024529921 2020-10-14 05:47:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Look at how close three of the Dem circuits are. Only solid one is DC. Will be ironic when the legacy of the Reid Nuclear Option is Democrats only controlling one Court of Appeals in the whole country.
1316133076637024257 2020-10-14 05:45:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 Eh, I wouldn't say that. I used to live in a Portland suburb, so I know them a little bit better than most.

1316127918741954566 2020-10-14 05:25:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Biden is 20 points ahead and can't fill a socially distanced room. I believe!
1316127513932976128 2020-10-14 05:23:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BibMccafferty @SelimSeesYou Hillary barely got above 50% and that was mostly because PDX suburban Republicans had a strong distaste for ideological reasons.
1316126968052699136 2020-10-14 05:21:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Yeah, I was looking at old McCain campaign articles and they were much less optimistic than these. They were like "well, maybe if we shove all of our resources into PA, we'll come up with a miracle." Trump's team seems optimistic, but not leaving anything to chance.
1316125002853421058 2020-10-14 05:13:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 Oregon was close in 2000 and 2004. Only reason Trump ran so far behind in 2016 was a lot of NeverTrump ideologues in PDX area who voted third party.

1316121120253374471 2020-10-14 04:58:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @uhhhhhhhhhhhuh @SelimSeesYou They think if we never elected Trump, this land would not be cursed with a pandemic. But Evangelicals are crazy if they suggest California wildfires have anything to do with God's wrath.
1316120593411051520 2020-10-14 04:56:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou They, therefore, believe that either:  1. The American people are in on it and are raping minorities for all they're worth. 2. The Republicans systematically rig elections by denying people their right to vote through voter ID laws.
1316120306998804482 2020-10-14 04:55:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou You have to understand the way their perverted mind thinks. They legitimately believe that Republicans are this evil cabal of self-interested, kind of dumb and uneducated, bully boys who don't care if people live or die, so long as they get their two nickels out of it.
1316118712571834369 2020-10-14 04:48:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JoelLoren1 We’re really struggling. We both only make low six figures and live in a luxury apartment two blocks from where we work.

1316115677514625024 2020-10-14 04:36:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Yeah. These couple live together for like two years and then decided to go for a cash grab for a wedding to obtain the gifts. Quite ridiculous.
1316114948301426688 2020-10-14 04:33:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical @AirBossUT It's just a state with a lot of demographic flux and a battle between New North Carolinians and the more native population.
1316113653800763392 2020-10-14 04:28:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical @AirBossUT Honestly North Carolina is one of the harder states to analyze. I don't really know what's going on there.

1316111517213962241 2020-10-14 04:20:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wasphyxiation “Yeah I totally voted for Donald Trump in 2016. Now I hate him.”  *Actually voted for Jill Stein.*
1316109143745482758 2020-10-14 04:10:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @JackKaiser16 @davidchapman141 And they are extremely independent voters. They switch around all the time.
1316108631289466880 2020-10-14 04:08:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Twopointoh14 @SelbJim @davidchapman141 The libs are claiming it's a conservative poll because the Review Journal is owned by Adelson. Disregard that AARP also sponsored the poll and they're in the tank for the Dems.
1316107225556017154 2020-10-14 04:03:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 I was informed Biden was 17 points ahead nationally. How can this be?
1316106528550776834 2020-10-14 04:00:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 So far it all seems to be a pretty base-oriented election across the board. I can really see a lot of infrequent voters turning out on election day for Trump, though. Unaffiliated voters are at best running even with 2016.
1316105004571398145 2020-10-14 03:54:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 I'm talking specifically about Florida here. Midwest seems mostly super voters. Minnesota is showing an equal intensity with 2016 in youth voters, though.
1316103926215774208 2020-10-14 03:50:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 And given the shade Trump has thrown on early VBM, I would actually expect later infrequent voters to skew Republican if anything.
1316103559658770440 2020-10-14 03:48:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 I always say: ANYTHING is possible. However, there's just no indication of a groundswell of excited youth voters or suburbanites who hate Trump that don't vote on the regular anyway. It's all a big dud so far.
1316102419579887619 2020-10-14 03:44:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @Redistrict sCRamBlInG!   Maybe he should ask why Biden "scrambled" to Nevada a few days ago.
1316099957800284163 2020-10-14 03:34:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 Just to give you an idea, in order for infrequent voters to make the same percentage as they did in 2016, they'd need to turn over a hundred thousand extra ballots in Florida compared to their current percentage.
1316099679550144512 2020-10-14 03:33:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 That only makes it harder for infrequent voters to surge as a percentage of the electorate.
1316098944338980865 2020-10-14 03:30:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CarlStein1984 Thank you. So, it looks like Democrats are slightly outperforming Republicans in infrequent voters, but it is very marginal right now.
1316098771491663874 2020-10-14 03:29:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 That's down a third compared to the same time in the previous elections.
1316098293106184194 2020-10-14 03:27:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 That's actually significantly lower than 2016 and 2018. First time and infrequent voters are down a third.   Right now, GOP counties tend to have lower Super Voters, higher frequent counties, and marginally worse infrequent voters. We're talking 20 vs 25% here, not crazy.
1316096499328090120 2020-10-14 03:20:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Increasing the standard deduction was a nice boon to lower income people. Having a bunch of money that isn't taxed at all is better than a marginal decrease in percentage.
1316096224240570369 2020-10-14 03:19:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I wish I could cross-reference the TargetSmart data for voting propensity with party ID. Just based on the surface level Florida data, it mostly looks like Frequent and Super Dem voters, but 23% are infrequent voters and who those are matters a great deal.
1316095798388629504 2020-10-14 03:17:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim The Baris poll indicated something like a quarter of Biden voters already had voted and only a single digit percentage of Trump voters had.
1316094848131358720 2020-10-14 03:13:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim PA is going to be bad for Republicans in mail ins because the court battles there have made a lot of news.
1316094444391862273 2020-10-14 03:12:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Looking at the early vote in Texas, not much is in yet, but turnout in Harris and Dallas counties doesn't look as robust as GOP-leaning Tarrant County. It's all old people right now, though.
1316085925567516674 2020-10-14 02:38:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CBruno4444 @CottoGottfried Yeah, some big counties are only reporting a few dozen votes.
1316084951817781250 2020-10-14 02:34:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OneGravitas @turrible_tao Federalist Society figured this out with Gorsuch, who is more of a textualist. They're only recommending originalists now to Trump. Originalists are far more dependable.
1316083598097776643 2020-10-14 02:29:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @turrible_tao Textualism sucks because lefties are in charge of defining words for the most part, but at least it makes some sense in theory.
1316083423837073408 2020-10-14 02:28:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @turrible_tao Seriously. Besides textualism, the only other options essentially amount to judges making law. Why even elect a Congress? Just have the Courts, the Senate to confirm the judges, and the President to enforce whatever the courts say.
1316081370633056256 2020-10-14 02:20:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @covfefe_forever @SelbJim @bestgtor88 @CottoGottfried True. Pence does come from the conservative wing of the party, though. He was a former talk radio host lol. Party has changed a lot since then and the northeast moderate wing is so out of power it's almost sad.

1316080636365623296 2020-10-14 02:17:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @DayPolitical @CottoGottfried At least Johnson/Weld were two former governors and Johnson had previously ran for President as a Republican. Even he was a Trump vote parker for the most part, though. Jorgenson? Certainly Trump votes parked there.
1316079701564284928 2020-10-14 02:13:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @covfefe_forever @SelbJim @bestgtor88 @CottoGottfried It will really depend on how Trump's second term goes. Eventually people will want to return to normalcy and to have a traditional President. Pence has potential, if he wants to, to really seal Trump's legacy in a way HW Bush did not seal Reagan's.
1316078502702129153 2020-10-14 02:09:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @covfefe_forever @SelbJim @bestgtor88 @CottoGottfried I think Pence is the only traditional Republican who gets it on this front. If Nikki Haley runs in 2024, she will be laughed off the stage.

Portland lefties are a violent, intolerant breed and have been for decades.
1316076969797324800 2020-10-14 02:02:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @covfefe_forever @SelbJim @bestgtor88 @CottoGottfried CA GOP was MAGA before MAGA was cool. This is the same party that supported Prop 187. National Republicans have excoriated the local GOP for focusing so hard on illegal immigration.
1316076679413014528 2020-10-14 02:01:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @covfefe_forever @SelbJim @CottoGottfried Trump made some unusual gains in Oregon while losing heavily in suburban Portland. Suburban Portland doesn't look bad demographically, but it is heavily ideological. So, Trump flipped a lot of literal lumberjacks who have vote Dem their whole life and lost ideologues in PDX.
1316075024483258368 2020-10-14 01:55:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @covfefe_forever @SelbJim @bestgtor88 @CottoGottfried No Party Preference California voters also tend to break Republican on the state level in California as well, even in bad years.
1316074793511378945 2020-10-14 01:54:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @covfefe_forever @SelbJim @bestgtor88 @CottoGottfried If we don't see it this year, I do think California will start trending Republican again in 2022. They are starting to net gain in voters again after, like I said, two decades of losing enrolled voters while Dems gained millions.
1316074120325591041 2020-10-14 01:51:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @bestgtor88 @CottoGottfried It is possible for Trump to improve in the state while the Barnes Presidential registration model to hold true if Biden improves to 62-65 and Trump improves to 32-36.   You are partially right: California GOP Prez votes track well with registrations, Dem Prez votes don't.
1316072633889370113 2020-10-14 01:45:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @bestgtor88 @CottoGottfried So, if Trump wins the election, but loses the popular vote more than last time, it comes from that flood of 1.3 million net Democrats in California. Maybe they don't show up and they are an artifact of the 2018 cycle, but I'd bet on at least a large chunk showing up.
1316072307425718272 2020-10-14 01:44:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @bestgtor88 @CottoGottfried I was tabulating numbers over the weekend: Nearly half of the net new registered Dems in the country are in California alone. There's 1.6 million new Dems. Only 300K new Republicans (which, to be fair, is at least a gain after nearly 20 years of losing raw voters).
1316070839897468935 2020-10-14 01:38:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @CottoGottfried California could see unprecedented Dem turnout. I think if Trump loses PV by 3, that's likely where it comes from.
1316070249196916736 2020-10-14 01:36:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried A lot of those Jorgenson votes are parked Trump votes. Jorgenson get 1-2 and Trump gains a 1-2 points there. Biden likely squeezes half point out of Hawkins voters. Then Trump ends up tied from undecideds breaking for him.
1316065193370292224 2020-10-14 01:16:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Joe Biden endorses Donald Trump for President.

1316060772255125504 2020-10-14 00:58:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 Republicans always return their ballots late for some reason. What we're seeing with the youth vote is the most interesting: It's nowhere to be found.
1316058385217978368 2020-10-14 00:49:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 Statewide races specifically. Like Florida early voting in 2018 favored the GOP and polls didn't: GOP won.
1316057367134507009 2020-10-14 00:45:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just feel like if either the polls OR early voting favor Republicans, Republicans always win that race. I can't think of an exception since 2014.
1316056422556274688 2020-10-14 00:41:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These people think you can only be objective if you're one of them. If you're from a conservative background and do things like own guns, go to Church regularly, or at this point if you're even just an ordinary married person, you're inherently biased.
1316051137833951234 2020-10-14 00:20:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DontFollowMeMNT @realikamusume Consider that they'll double down on 2016 formula and be willing to call blue states earlier than red states. Like, Georgia should not have taken so long to call and it was obvious where Florida was going hours before as well.
1316048349167050752 2020-10-14 00:09:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @realikamusume 1/3 keeps their hopes alive. 2/3 seals the deal IMO.
1316047339275128833 2020-10-14 00:05:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly @realikamusume If the GOP can take back 2/3 seats in Virginia they’re in really good shape to take back the House. The third is impossible, but just 1/3 keeps them in the game.
1316047076220960769 2020-10-14 00:04:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cicero1776 @realikamusume They’re really hitting Gade hard on Covid.
1316046691485782023 2020-10-14 00:02:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume It appears a lot of Fairfax is already at a fifth of their returns from 2016. Richmond similar. Having them already factored in a little bit before voting day could help Republicans know their targets.
1316042132604452865 2020-10-13 23:44:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume This is 40+ state landslide territory for Biden. Where are the Texas polls to back it up? Where are the polls to show Tennessee is looking weak for Trump?
1316041603434401798 2020-10-13 23:42:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I never pursued the Ph.D because I knew the odds of getting a job in a field of interest were tiny.
1316036969525280769 2020-10-13 23:23:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump really needs to change the conversation to long term issues. Covid is his main weakness and are we really going to choose the next President that will end?
1316031471967178753 2020-10-13 23:02:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This has been standard since I've been volunteering in politics.
1315905050598928384 2020-10-13 14:39:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Short memories cause so many problems in our society. People’s memories of news events often seem entirely made up to me and it’s funny when they’ll insist on their misguided memory over hard contemporary evidence their memory is wrong.
1315900915686297603 2020-10-13 14:23:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @Oblivion2elect1 It makes the most sense of the GOP registration surge we are seeing in the rust belt.
1315900652774666240 2020-10-13 14:22:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @HeritageNLegacy It’s dumb when tortured to death, but the fundamental errors of liberalism and pelagianism are the same: No recognition of the inherent corruption of man. Of course, there’s differences, but it is one reason why orthodox Christian political liberalism is a non-starter.
1315899550985531392 2020-10-13 14:17:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Oblivion2elect1 @NoctRomaRTW Democrats are depending on White college educated women to turn out because they hate Trump. This is disastrous for them.
1315898309094125568 2020-10-13 14:12:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @SirDowden Well that’s just true.
1315897879647653894 2020-10-13 14:11:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @SirDowden “Really atheism is Gnosticism because blah blah blah.” Just more argument by labeling. Ultimate midwit tactic.
1315891597754527745 2020-10-13 13:46:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @davidchapman141 My grandfather is from rural Kentucky. He talks like this.
1315891289884372997 2020-10-13 13:45:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Most pols just try to plug gaps when they’re bleeding and only ever attack soft targets. Leaves a lot on the table.
1315890876900691969 2020-10-13 13:43:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou It’s really basic grand strategy. It’s just dumb to leave your flank open before heading out on an offensive. Most pols don’t think in these terms for some reason.
1315888860971311104 2020-10-13 13:35:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 Mitch has always talked like this.
1315888441708761089 2020-10-13 13:33:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd I wonder what Thomas Aquinas would think of this.  Also, AJ Delgado is one sad creature.
1315887955504963584 2020-10-13 13:31:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CommissionerIs I was totally a Trump immigration supporter, so I decided to vote for Biden because Trump mean. Who cares about issues?
1315886335765475328 2020-10-13 13:25:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 @AnglicanMan19 To be fair, Mondale, McGovern, and Goldwater could all draw crowds. McCain could too. But so could all of their opponents and Biden can't.
1315885867198709760 2020-10-13 13:23:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @BrianSh86084519 Those national polls are utter trash. Like, they can't possible be right given state level polling we've seen in nearly every state. TX and GA are holding. FL and NC stay close. Even blue state polling is indicating similar margins as 2016, including in vote rich California.
1315884830375190529 2020-10-13 13:19:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical The problem for McCain is he ran as a moderate insurgent to a "conservative" establishment. The GOP is a conservative party: He really had no base to energize outside some Indies that can't vote in GOP primaries.
1315884068500799490 2020-10-13 13:16:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 Right now I'm thinking we will get around 140 million voters. If Trump can drive out his WWC base on election day, he could best Obama's raw vote total from 2008.
1315883790133231617 2020-10-13 13:15:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 Even in base elections, it matters who turns out those infrequent voters. Right now Trump can drag out a lot of infrequent WWC voters that didn't even vote for him in 2016 and that could make a huge difference.   2004 was a base election too with decent turnout.
1315883302671257601 2020-10-13 13:13:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical You have to remember McCain was the victim of a rather nasty underground campaign in the South Carolina Primary in 2000. I mean, McCain always sucked, but he refused to campaign negatively after that until he went NeverTrump.
1315882657339891718 2020-10-13 13:10:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BrianSh86084519 That's just not really true. People who vote more than two weeks in advance only matter if they haven't voted before. Right now, the early vote skews towards old, reliable voters. Last two weeks you can shovel in a lot of less reliable voters. where the race is really decided.
1315881836669816832 2020-10-13 13:07:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical McCain was at a real handicap that election and he never did anything to help himself besides pick Palin and she was a bit of a loose cannon that created a divide on the ticket: Not a good look in the end run.
1315881618712809472 2020-10-13 13:06:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical I was just reading some 08 articles. McCain's people basically found him down 6 in PA internals and just shoveled money in. But Nate Silver pointed out, of all things, the Dem registration advantage there. Funny that.  Not a terrible move when you have no options, I guess.
1315881056784936960 2020-10-13 13:04:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @Euphful1 Seriously: How is that building still standing?
1315880898504556544 2020-10-13 13:03:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical NC &amp; GA will be a Trump 4-5 point win (maybe a little more in GA): That's too close to risk, but not vulnerable. They're also small enough rallies matter a lot. Similar for IA. TX is too big. Two weeks out you want to give yourself some alternate paths. One week out: No chances.
1315880335977132032 2020-10-13 13:01:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical It makes a lot of sense. I've seen a lot of campaigns totally mess this up and just kind of run around without any gameplan for why they are doing it. Trump's team seems more in touch with voters than the Bush, McCain, and Romney teams were. I think Biden is doing that too.
1315878926628028422 2020-10-13 12:55:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 3 weeks out: Shore close base states. 2 weeks out: Try to expand the map a little. 1 week out: Focus on the tipping point states.
1315878773070364672 2020-10-13 12:55:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> About the Trump IA, NC, and GA visits: These states will be close, even if Trump will win them comfortably enough. I think it makes sense to visit them to shore up support, especially this coming week. If we're seeing a lot of that at the end of October, I'd be concerned.
1315876354731241472 2020-10-13 12:45:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee This is one reason why polls can and have changed quick, in spite of conventional wisdom to the contrary. Real people convincing other real people to change their vote or turnout when they weren't going to can and has swung elections. This isn't a machine: *People* vote.
1315875580206813184 2020-10-13 12:42:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FullLennyJacket @RealAPolitics Been noticing huge numbers of bots lately. Probably because there's about ten people in the country enthusiastically supporting Biden.
1315875116467748864 2020-10-13 12:40:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat Eh, CalGOP might be. They're run by a different breed.
1315874474529632268 2020-10-13 12:38:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Peoples_Pundit I'm convinced every NeverTrump Republican in the entire country is within two degrees of Bill Kristol personally.
1315873874463121408 2020-10-13 12:35:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat The bottom left of the political compass is the most divorced from reality. This is known.
1315871152234008577 2020-10-13 12:25:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee This is America. We've always believed the only poll that really matters is Election Day. Make your case. Say what you believe and why you believe it. This is all gaslighting when used to discourage voters.
1315869475279904775 2020-10-13 12:18:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @AdamWilday Republicans did turn out to vote in the midterms in record numbers. There was just a 17 point swing against the GOP in Indie voters and Dems increased their share by 1%. ONE. The strat probably saved the Senate and 200 House seats isn't a total disaster.
1315868320877498368 2020-10-13 12:13:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads One day, hopefully sooner than we think now, everyone who casts a vote for Biden will be too embarrassed to admit it publicly.
1315866942087913472 2020-10-13 12:08:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @stock1847 @KingFrenly I think there's consensus weapons continued evolving in spite of other technological decay. An argument can be made that for most of history, weapons technology advances more during period of decay than prosperity. An exception would have to be made for industrial warfare.
1315865979625320450 2020-10-13 12:04:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @BeigeShiba Biden/Harris is a one term Admin, just like Carter. The GOP will win 2024 if they win this year. Probably won't be worth a win at that point, though.
1315865234142265347 2020-10-13 12:01:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Looking at MN ballot returns in the rurals and the fact it really looks like St. Louis County is flipping, it's really looking good there for Trump. NV is an unknown, but the Dems are handicapped with layoffs for Strip employees (and they all blame the Dem governor, not Trump.).
1315864711695663104 2020-10-13 11:59:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @BeigeShiba Nixon is also a hit even with the moderate Dem ladies in my experience. He's just fun. Just like Trump will be in like 10 years (and would be now if not for the relentless media spin).
1315864143442980866 2020-10-13 11:57:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I'm beginning to think there's some chance of a Trump mini-landslide like we saw for Obama in 2008. I think overall turnout will remain steady this year, with Ds just unable to get their people to the polls and WWC getting out in a way never seen before. Run even in the burbs.
1315863317764870145 2020-10-13 11:53:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly Their advantage was primarily one of superior organization, tactics, and logistics.
1315862820773298176 2020-10-13 11:51:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba @RupertVonRipp Think I'm going to go as tricky Dick to Halloween this year. Just in that kind of mood.
1315861399139233793 2020-10-13 11:46:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads This is pretty powerful messaging.
1315857036232609792 2020-10-13 11:28:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd Only Republicans are capable of vote fraud. Few know this.
1315856726340644865 2020-10-13 11:27:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba @RupertVonRipp Most people who have a strong opinion of Nixon in my experience still like the guy. Could be what happens to Trump: Used as a punching by the left for the next 6 years or so and then everyone who remembers him remembers him fondly.
1315853245189967872 2020-10-13 11:13:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @YanHui89767430 @a_wassen Correct answer.
1315853029745319936 2020-10-13 11:13:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics No technology is as secure as a paper ballot.
1315839906414039040 2020-10-13 10:20:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics I thought they believed polls.
1315837705515945984 2020-10-13 10:12:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Thinking CNN sucks is the same thing as fascism.
1315837235879608322 2020-10-13 10:10:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried Everyone's concerned about the VBM numbers in Florida, but it's all old people who always vote anyway. Like, who cares? Also, the GOP seems to be making up in requests since the last time I checked.
1315835797346672641 2020-10-13 10:04:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 The Iowa Caucuses are incredibly hard to poll on both sides. Only the Des Moines Register poll gets close and even then you really have to dig into trends and, on the GOP side, wait for the Dutch Reformed endorsement (there's a guy who tells them how to vote, forgot his name).
1315835322354274304 2020-10-13 10:02:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @TXVet4Trump It was a deciding state in 2016. It actually wasn't called yet when Fox News project PA for Trump, but it was clearly leaning in Trump's direction.
1315834000821420033 2020-10-13 09:57:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @TXVet4Trump Florida was clearly going to Trump by 9 even thought they didn't call it. If Trump doubles his margin and is getting at least 36% in Miami-Dade, it will be obvious, perhaps even as soon as the Panhandle starts reporting. Similar with GA.   Arizona won't be called, though.
1315833110064500738 2020-10-13 09:53:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @SelbJim @Overlord26 @AirBossUT Apparently it does extend into Franklin and Fulton counties, which combine for ~165K people and both counties gave over 70% to Trump and nearly the same to Romney. Seems like a waste of money to me if that's what they're eyeing.
1315830215575302145 2020-10-13 09:42:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @LuisBobby3 @Overlord26 @AirBossUT I saw a Biden ad here in DC yesterday. I hardly watch TV, but I was surprised. There's barely even a competitive house race that touches the DC media market.
1315829316371054593 2020-10-13 09:38:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @VeryOnlineGuy1 @ScottMGreer I grew up in the Bay Area and my folks listened to him from the first day he was on the air. I think I started *asking* to listen to Savage around 9 or 10. Probably not healthy looking back on it, but it happened lol.

Things have changed very little in this regard.
1315823749145522176 2020-10-13 09:16:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeardedDraygon @GodRemembrancer Probably both.

1315819601759014912 2020-10-13 09:00:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried @realikamusume Trump projects confidence and fun at these rallies. Biden’s like “please don’t call me a socialist.”

1315814690799398915 2020-10-13 08:40:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RomanBardylius @ibrahimalipasha Sorry, the Serbian American vote is larger and they say no.
1315812480942329861 2020-10-13 08:31:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly This is just from the rally. Definitely a lot of enthusiasm for Trump, though. He could win new voters if new voters aren't the people pollsters think they are (young and liberal urban and suburbanites.
1315812156462510081 2020-10-13 08:30:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @CityBureaucrat I've never seen people switch tunes like they do with Trump. Everyone gives their side more grace and the other less, but Trump just causes people to talk out of both sides of their mouth in a single sentence.
1315811796658393088 2020-10-13 08:29:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Isn't it grand? LMAO.
1315809917656354816 2020-10-13 08:21:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @gildhelm @ReformedPepe I have seen some "school choice" programs where you can only pick whatever public school you want and those tend to work the way you indicated.
1315809669139623938 2020-10-13 08:20:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @gildhelm @ReformedPepe Depends on how it's implemented. The typical conservative proposal is a school voucher program. It will take some time, but over time you'll see a natural arrangement of people into self-segregated schools based on social class (religion, race, and income/education level).
1315809055399649282 2020-10-13 08:18:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReformedPepe The reason why they do that is to distract from the real reason they want to do it: To please religious conservatives who want to send their kids to the local Christian high school, but can't afford to do so. It does help minority kids on the margins, though.
1315808565681061890 2020-10-13 08:16:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Maxwellulous @RealAPolitics Minnesota is looking very strong for Trump. Dems only prayer right now is to increase margins even further in MSP suburbs and I don't think it's possible.
1315807939677040645 2020-10-13 08:13:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @VeriteJacques It's a massive improvement. Everyone will benefit from this arrangement in the long run. Even, I believe, school teachers: Private schools might be forced to start offering more competitive salaries.
1315806965428367360 2020-10-13 08:10:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReformedPepe Fact is this will get a lot of kids out of the liberal public schools. A lot of families will choose to send their kids to private religious schools.

1315806319207739394 2020-10-13 08:07:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReformedPepe There’s zero evidence this happens to any significant degree and some evidence to the opposite. Towns in the South came up with a type of school choice as a means of essentially continuing segregation by mutual consent.
1315803415247818752 2020-10-13 07:55:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Ben Sasse has always looked sickly and kind of dumb to me.

1315802926347169792 2020-10-13 07:53:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump promises school choice. Wignats mad for no discernible reason.
1315801787866271744 2020-10-13 07:49:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @billsretpal @realikamusume True. Been there done that. It’s even worse up north: Look at what happened in San Joaquin. But part of it had to have been native. Place trended more than 10 points Dem in 2016.
1315797937826529280 2020-10-13 07:34:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They’ll claim he’s still dying if he speaks for 15 minutes less than average.

1315785896583671813 2020-10-13 06:46:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Euphful1 Most of history is full of ugly buildings. The oldest known occupied residence in the world in France is UGLY and looks like it’s held up by magic. For the most part, the beautiful buildings survive the test of time and the ugly ones fall into disrepair.
1315783911105064960 2020-10-13 06:38:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Being built with indoor plumbing and electricity in mind and having more space than we know what to do with.   This is quaint and all, but Old Urbanist trads post some of the most ridiculous cringe on the right.

You mean to say there are 15% more Democrats. 15% Dem registration advantage would mean 15% more of the electorate is Democrat (so 45%-30% for instance).

1315763575051431937 2020-10-13 05:17:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago We should create a second class of state we give one Senator and make SF Bay Area, LA, Chicago, NYC Metro this type of state.
1315762927148904450 2020-10-13 05:15:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago New York is so dominated by NYC in a way PA is not dominated by Philly, though.

1315762251035541506 2020-10-13 05:12:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago Probably because those three states are now solid one way or the other and Missouri is part rust belt, part corn belt. But so is Iowa.

Only way I can see it bucking a trend to that degree. However, it would be crazy if Trump flipped a 30 point Dem County while losing similar counties by the same margin.

Maybe even carry Duluth itself? I don’t see how Trump loses Minnesota while carry St. Louis for the first time since 1928.

It's pretty easy to infer party affiliation based on certain activities and the few times it's wrong, it tends to be wrong equally in both directions.
1315510287869640705 2020-10-12 12:31:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Then we can argue about the second one. Who started it, why, maybe even when it started. We will even argue about what America looked like in the antebellum years.

1315505195510624256 2020-10-12 12:10:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Could independents swing against Trump wildly? Could he not steal enough PA Dems like he did last time? Possible, but Republicans stealing PA Dems (PA Dems are renowned for their disloyalty) and winning Indies stretches back decades before Trump.
1315504905449136128 2020-10-12 12:09:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Also, with the polls this tight, and given the high turnout of a Presidential race, things like historical trends are more reliable estimators than current polling. Simple fact is that there are more Republicans in all of these states than there were four years ago.
1315504335648944134 2020-10-12 12:07:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation All I'm saying, which you agree with, is that the current round of national polling has to be off. Given that is off, it isn't a stretch to think we're seeing polling errors in the key states matching 2016. That's all that has to happen for Trump to win.
1315501509065535489 2020-10-12 11:56:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Florida does tend to be a tight race regardless. They only voted for Obama by 4 points in the 08 mini-landslide. As I pointed out last night, the one that gets me is Texas because it's so large with a very diverse population that leans suburban and college educated.
1315500767906758657 2020-10-12 11:53:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation If Biden is ahead so much nationally, we really are looking at losing states like Texas. Arizona too would be gone. New Jersey wouldn't be at the same margin it was in 2016 (two polls there recently showed that). Heck, the last poll in CA was within the MOE of 2016.
1315500435260796928 2020-10-12 11:51:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Same. I really don't like believing this because it just seems far out there, but it really just makes no sense to me when you dissect it. Like, how can Florida be a 2-3 point race if Biden is ahead so much nationally? Why would they publish such an obviously bad poll?
1315498491439964161 2020-10-12 11:44:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation @davidchapman141 ...admitted that even the EXIT POLLS (which are vaunted for their finality and vast scope) were absolute trash.
1315498361512919040 2020-10-12 11:43:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation @davidchapman141 When you remove USC/Dornsife they missed it by 2 and when you incorporate the fact they undersampled NY and CA, it's more like 3. The only reason they were even close was CA turnout surge no one foresaw. You should go back to 2016 election night when the raw commentary...
1315497760351834112 2020-10-12 11:41:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation I'm sorry, but I just don't think you can put any weight at all in these national polls. Zero. They are obvious propaganda. The state level polling is more down to earth, but that shows a tighter race right now than 2016.
1315496593584521216 2020-10-12 11:36:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation This isn't by trusting or not trusting polls. It's about the fact the polls are all over the place. Even the polls showing Biden in the lead in the swing states indicate those states have shifted massively towards the Republicans in relation to the national electorate.
1315496338885402624 2020-10-12 11:35:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation There has to be a huge polling error this cycle *somewhere*. It is impossible for it not to happen. According to national polling right now, when compared to state polling, the only two states trending blue in relation to the national vote are MN and KS.  https://t.co/bAozsnX6ca
1315495919698182144 2020-10-12 11:34:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation @hfahcl @westland_will Notably that's what Trump got in 2016.
1315494083377459200 2020-10-12 11:26:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Please just tell me we will be having this much fun in the 2024 race.
1315490511755542528 2020-10-12 11:12:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @eball0911 @JacksonPackson1 @AirBossUT Should be noted that even if they are Biden ballots, turnout tends to increase in areas, not independently by party. So, if rural county turnout is higher, it will likely be higher for both Ds and Rs (not accounting for potential flipped voters).

1315466317672198147 2020-10-12 09:36:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 Disagree. Most polls have her 2 or 3 points behind Trump. I think if Trump wins the state by 3-5, he'll drag her over.
1315466126210596866 2020-10-12 09:35:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pabloplato @davidchapman141 He wants the seat in 2022.

Also, that popular vote margin was heavily influenced by disastrous nights in CA, NY, and NJ. Wasn’t really an awful night in the rust belt. Lost a few house seats and didn’t unseat the incumbent senators, but not bad.
1315450201730101248 2020-10-12 08:32:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Given than Democrats could get a 5 million vote margin out of California, not terribly crazy.

1315446574512775168 2020-10-12 08:17:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The conventional wisdom is approval ratings determine incumbent prospects. What if the campaign affects the approval ratings?

1315423912205914112 2020-10-12 06:47:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biden is totally winning so hard, he has to run ads in DC.

1315408760731586562 2020-10-12 05:47:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @incelsage I’m not a huge fan of country pop, but if you’re going to hate on country, you’re just hating on old school Taylor Swift. Like, why?
1315408524789325825 2020-10-12 05:46:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @incelsage I really don’t get all the country music hate. Seems incredibly artificial to me. There’s just some undeniably good country songs and a lot of it is just Country Pop.

1315404078093135873 2020-10-12 05:29:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you have no other reason to vote for Trump, just consider that it will prove the media hold over our politics is broken FOREVER. If that alone isn’t worth it, I don’t know what is.
1315403101839536128 2020-10-12 05:25:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @zerowing0 Biden will get plenty of votes in Fairfax County because the ballot printing presses will look like this:  https://t.co/PI0iLqzkZN

1315401644092383232 2020-10-12 05:19:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @zerowing0 I know people like this. It’s why I think Virginia might end up closer than many suspect. Trump lost 50K raw votes in Fairfax County compared to Romney. I think he gets at least half of those back.

1315386701267841024 2020-10-12 04:20:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BatteryFive Mitch McConnell has honestly surprised me. He grows in strength.
1315386224782307329 2020-10-12 04:18:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Eh, the map looks like three GOP seats in play for the Dems (minus potentially Arizona). Three Dem seats potentially open for GOP.

1315383534090100736 2020-10-12 04:07:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 I live nowhere near them, but I know someone who they did antibody tests on: They had it in December after a trip to China. We think our grandmother had it in February as she lives less than a mile away from that individual and was very sick with something that wasn’t the flu.
1315381604467040258 2020-10-12 03:59:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot 21-22% probably didn’t vote last election and we really don’t know who these people are. 4% totally new voters is a disaster for Democrats. DISASTER. That’s the only group of infrequent voters they win by a huge margin. For all we know the infrequent voters are Trump’s.
1315380643321315329 2020-10-12 03:55:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Did I already get Covid or something? I haven’t so much as had the sniffles since this thing started and like I stopped caring about the social distancing thing in like June.

1315379779407880192 2020-10-12 03:52:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CassandraRules You cannot have a democratic policy run like this. It’s just doomed to devolve into tribal conflict and ultimately tragic violence.
1315377050988023808 2020-10-12 03:41:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReactionaryIan If Trump’s second admin is successful, he’ll run as Trump’s third term and likely be able to reclaim the wavering suburban votes Romney got and keep the Trump base. Wins by 8 points and it’s never really a race.
1315376158960242692 2020-10-12 03:38:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Looking at registrations, it appears to have worked.
1315375486873358337 2020-10-12 03:35:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Versus Harris who is only second fiddle right now because she slept with Willie Brown.
1315375292635123720 2020-10-12 03:34:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Imagine saying this against Pence, who has been a strong conservative ideologue and intellectual leader of the conservative wing of the Republican Party from the time he was elected to the House.
1315374468546600960 2020-10-12 03:31:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DataDistribute How will the right? Geez. With friends like these...
1315374067390783494 2020-10-12 03:29:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReactionaryIan If Pence wins 2024, the President after him will likely be a millennial Democrat.
1315373630633783297 2020-10-12 03:28:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReactionaryIan One reason he won’t win. I think GenX might get skipped too.
1315371395564568576 2020-10-12 03:19:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Agreed and Trump’s policies have helped the Iron Range more than any other single region of the country. The place was nearly dead and now it’s growing again. Honestly think Minnesota would be in the bag for him sans Covid.
1315352661122838532 2020-10-12 02:04:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Oblivion2elect1 Totally Biden voters.

1315325296493637633 2020-10-12 00:16:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It’s funny because this was literally the issue in the landmark Marbury v. Madison decision that established judicial review. Adams had packed the courts with supporters two days before his term ended.

1315194996660801537 2020-10-11 15:38:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried @NoctRomaRTW Like, thousands of these registered Dems might not even be in Nevada anymore and if they are, they may not be solid voters.
1315194759850479618 2020-10-11 15:37:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried @NoctRomaRTW The one thing that could upset Nevada in this analysis is that VBM might not go as well for them as years past because the Reid Machine depends heavily on Strip Employees turning out for Dems and there’s thousands less.
1315185751462641665 2020-10-11 15:01:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried @NoctRomaRTW You posted cringe, bro.
1315184826182512641 2020-10-11 14:57:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Will they even accept the election results? I think they trust their polls more than hard ballots.

1315173960787648512 2020-10-11 14:14:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @davidchapman141 And I’ve never know a WWC male who buys propaganda. If you want to hear some truly crackpot conspiracy theories, speak to your nearest welder.
1315173627965386758 2020-10-11 14:13:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @davidchapman141 I think it’s just common sense. People don’t show up to vote for the opposite of what they voted for four years ago because “Orange Man Bad.” Even if they bought the propaganda, they’d just stay home.
1315171786804297728 2020-10-11 14:06:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat I find it ironic because Virginia did, in fact, call in vain.
1315171450882600960 2020-10-11 14:04:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 @LudicrousHilar1 @KAGsquatch Nonresponse rates aren’t a terribly big deal if you’re using a reliable, representative method like landline polling was for 50-75 years. They’re a big problem when they vary by method and demographic group.
1315168992798167040 2020-10-11 13:54:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Even though all these national polls are officially worse for Trump than 16, I’m still less worried about them. Why? In 16 you legit had Republicans defecting and in near panic over it. This year? Has any elected Republican expressed any signs of fleeing because of polls?
1315168097708511232 2020-10-11 13:51:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JHarleyJames @JH53361341 @PatriarchPrimus @KMGVictoria Read the Epistle to the Hebrews. You know, the one that explains why you shouldn’t sacrifice animals anymore using the Old Testament.

1315163441469030401 2020-10-11 13:32:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KMGVictoria Agreed. I find the suggestion that God would command the Israelites to do something harmful merely as a show of good faith to be incredibly impious.

1315160734603542529 2020-10-11 13:22:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing Gallup is a marketing firm that used its presidential polling to market their legitimate business product. "Hey, we predicted the President five times in a row, let us help you sell junk." Not so with most of these new firms. They NEED to be accurate. Unis don't.
1315159570885545984 2020-10-11 13:17:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing At this point, yes. I think Baris is right: Since Gallup left the polling business, it's basically the Wild West. Whatever else they were, they were a responsible outfit whose misses made sense and weren't always in one direction. A firm anchor.
1315158773556809728 2020-10-11 13:14:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailbla_zing This election isn't about "believing polls" versus "not believing polls." It's simply a fact these polls are all over the place. No way they're good across the board. Some of them will be AT LEAST five plus points off the mark.
1315157221525934080 2020-10-11 13:08:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These national polls are such ridiculously obvious propaganda when compared with state level polling. Texas is a huge, populous state. No way it defies national trends to this degree, but even more so with its electoral makeup.
1315156972665212929 2020-10-11 13:07:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Currently Texas is Trump+4.4 in the RCP average. Trump+6 averaged for the only two polls in October. National average is Biden+9.8. Texas is an R+8 state heading into the election. It defies all convention wisdom and common sense that Texas has shifted 6 points right.

I can see him being right if Paul ran in 2004, did a version of his 08 run, took enough of the party in 2004 and then won in 2008.
1315079128496865282 2020-10-11 07:57:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 The electoral college technically favored them from 2004-2012. I think the dynamics of elections make this an unlikely scenario in reality, though. Democrats have been the PV winner in every EV-PV split and were basically founded because of such an incident.
1315077877621288961 2020-10-11 07:52:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The electoral college makes the American Presidential Election the single most interesting election on the planet and liberals want to get rid of it.

1315033476110970883 2020-10-11 04:56:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation It’s even worse when you realize the gap between New York and New Jersey and the rest of top ten is massive. The first red state on the list probably never catch up to NY and NJ. Louisiana is the highest red state, has a D governor, and got surprised with an early breakout.

1314814234094645248 2020-10-10 14:25:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @coogerjr @RealAPolitics Then he shouldn't even be campaigning at all. .

1314796910339817477 2020-10-10 13:16:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> What is going on with these polls? Like, how do 56% of Americans think this and still have Biden in the race?

And he does have that giant golden campaign sign within eyesight of most Nevada voters: Has to count for something.

1314703741598281736 2020-10-10 07:06:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I find it incredibly odd a generation that rejects the tenets of classical religions rejects our basic material nature as omnivores, predator animals who reproduce sexually (two sexes: male and female). Like, it's just bizarre.
1314703194589716480 2020-10-10 07:04:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The only reason people are susceptible to this type of crap argument is because they're just incredibly separated from their nature in the material world. Despite our irreligion, we are in many ways more "spiritual" beings in that we reject our basic material nature.

However, they have added this category called "superprecedent" for it so they have a justification for not being willing to overturn it (not that there has been a relevant challenge).

They're not really that many people who are militantly anti-mask. I know one guy who is anti-mask to the point of annoyance and even he wears it when asked specifically to do so.
1314680419552571394 2020-10-10 05:33:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HornballChris Federal mask mandate is unconstitutional. Disqualified. Especially for an Executive Order. Maybe a statute could enforce it, but pass a statute for a temporary crisis is bad law.
1314680044065828866 2020-10-10 05:32:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Arizona is just the next Florida, guys. It’s not going to turn into a blue state. Retirees and movers will keep the state relatively balanced for some time. Nevada might become this over time too.
1314679660157034502 2020-10-10 05:30:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 Put all his campaign funds on a game of craps obviously. Oh, and to sniff the dealer’s hair.
1314679068621787137 2020-10-10 05:28:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Avoiding death isn’t worth not living.
1314678495058984961 2020-10-10 05:25:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HornballChris Ok. So the xenophobic travel ban is ok for Europe, but not the country we knew had more cases. We only knew it was spreading in Italy in mid to late February. By then it was already seeded here. Amazing the hypocrisy you’re willing to engage in though.
1314678053096882177 2020-10-10 05:24:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HornballChris No one in the world knew how to treat it at the time and before you blame Trump for not sending people to China: You honestly believe they’d have opened up if we asked nice and said pretty please?
1314677217423691776 2020-10-10 05:20:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HornballChris Just answer this question for me: Do you think it is possible for any Presidential policy to entirely arrest the spread of a respiratory illness? If so, what are those policies? If not, how much do you think it could have been reasonably slowed?
1314675371267239939 2020-10-10 05:13:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HornballChris Cases only matter insofar as they translate to deaths. Since the death rate is lower due to more effective treatment, the number of cases don’t matter as much as they did in say, April.
1314675139292868609 2020-10-10 05:12:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HornballChris The death rate for corona has collapsed since the spring. Just a fact. Cases don’t matter as much now. H1N1 is a virus that has been around since 1918: Covid-19 one that emerged last year. We now have effective treatments. What could Trump have done differently?
1314674105438875653 2020-10-10 05:08:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HornballChris So, which matters, deaths or cases? Pick one please.
1314673421566046209 2020-10-10 05:05:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReactionaryIan Olbermann or however you spell his name is such an unlikable dick not even leftist media could put up with his shenanigans any longer.
1314672855058178048 2020-10-10 05:03:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HornballChris @jerzguinzo @frodri_023 @Peoples_Pundit @Barnes_Law @CottoGottfried Yes, I love the latest ad for Trump from The Lincoln Project. Buy Regeneron! Do you want treatments or not? Like, what do you want exactly? No more Covid cases? That isn't going to happen.
1314672458973224963 2020-10-10 05:01:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HornballChris All I ask is some consistency from you people. A little fairmindedness, but no, so I won't give it to you.
1314672351808827392 2020-10-10 05:01:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HornballChris Also, if you're going to talk cases, have you asked Joe Biden how many Americans got H1N1 under his watch?   If Trump/Pence is responsible for every case of Covid, Biden has to be responsible for every case of H1N1 as he (like Pence) was in charge of the team.
1314672096799264768 2020-10-10 05:00:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HornballChris Who cares? It's amazing that you believe the government can stop a respiratory illness. Here's the deaths per million pop: Hint, they'll never catch up to the top two.  https://t.co/wfuDs9nyc4
1314671024366116866 2020-10-10 04:56:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HornballChris It isn't devastating red states with Republican governors. It has turned California and New York into intolerable hellholes. Try again.
1314669939400245248 2020-10-10 04:51:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These people tell you that you are a part of a personality cult when their biggest winning argument to vote for Biden is that he's got a better personality. Trump voters are issue voters.  They've come to like Trump's personality, but we like who we like.
1314669184727560193 2020-10-10 04:48:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HornballChris @jerzguinzo @frodri_023 @Peoples_Pundit @Barnes_Law @CottoGottfried Change the talking point: The American people just don't agree with you and all you got are half baked talking points. Enjoy living in fear your entire life over a bad cold.
1314668401546100738 2020-10-10 04:45:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jogger_American @FreeNortherner They are, partially, but I think one thing 2016 showed is that enough can be influenced by real issues that they can hold their nose on a personality flaw and Trump's personality deficit is actually lower nationally than it was 4 years ago.
1314667968555606017 2020-10-10 04:44:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner They pivoted hard back two weeks ago because of it. They know it's going poorly for them.
1314667343583342593 2020-10-10 04:41:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HornballChris @jerzguinzo @frodri_023 @Peoples_Pundit @Barnes_Law @CottoGottfried If you believe the polls, polls show the only reason people are even considering Biden is Trump's personality. Not even the rona would stop him otherwise.
1314667185818791937 2020-10-10 04:40:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HornballChris @jerzguinzo @frodri_023 @Peoples_Pundit @Barnes_Law @CottoGottfried Hahaha. Dude, I didn't even like Donald Trump when he announced his campaign. I thought I was tuning into a clown show. But he stood up on the border. Yes, I respect his personality because of that. Because of the issues! Exact opposite of your deranged opinions:  https://t.co/DmmxQC1adE
1314666047694307330 2020-10-10 04:36:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HornballChris @jerzguinzo @frodri_023 @Peoples_Pundit @Barnes_Law @CottoGottfried Even if Biden wins, it still won't validate your agenda, which is what you really hate about Trump. The people might have a problem with his temper, but they're not opposed to his policies.
1314664836375216131 2020-10-10 04:31:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HornballChris @jerzguinzo @frodri_023 @Peoples_Pundit @Barnes_Law @CottoGottfried Tens of millions of people love Trump. The people out of touch are the effete urban liberals who sneer at his voters.
1314663704525516806 2020-10-10 04:27:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They get upset when you decide you might want to defend yourself from this.
1314663540192612352 2020-10-10 04:26:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Someone has to do it folks. There's a first for everything!
1314663364610711557 2020-10-10 04:25:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> "Nobody has come back from this polling deficit!"  https://t.co/DdxmSWQUD5
1314662568385011719 2020-10-10 04:22:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Bob Dole refusing to take any more shit. Love it!
1314660427779973120 2020-10-10 04:14:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jondutoit It's the most effective grift operation ever. I'm honestly impressed.
1314659125830262785 2020-10-10 04:08:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou There are so many metrics that indicate is more popular with the Republican base than he was 4 years ago. Also, they're basing the economy thing of that one garbage CNN poll where Trump was behind 16. Biden led 50-48 (MOE) on economy. Like, ok, guys. Really?
1314657780746326017 2020-10-10 04:03:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 There's a reason her boyfriend didn't get charged: It was a random incident where both sides had the right to shoot. It just happens. Unfortunate, but that's life.
1314654872835371009 2020-10-10 03:52:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's just so obvious why the rest of it was setup: VP should be a Presidential ally, so he's only likely to invoke it when it's legit needed. The idea the President undeniably needs to go to the funny farm is provided for by the two thirds vote in Congress.
1314653585381232647 2020-10-10 03:46:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Whose idea was it to put in this dumb clause into Amendment 25 anyway? The entire purpose of that section is to provide for truly incapacitating events like a coma or something. Doesn’t take a panel of experts to tell you that.
1314653068001247232 2020-10-10 03:44:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @realikamusume @CottoGottfried That's how you know he's just a contrarian grifter.
1314652651683020801 2020-10-10 03:43:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @realikamusume @CottoGottfried The time to Tweet this was likes a week ago. Might have been true then. Today? Definitely some Trump momentum since the VP debate.
1314652381804666880 2020-10-10 03:42:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CommonM24045307 @davidchapman141 His favorability in 2016 was often in the low 30s. I don't think it ever cracked the 40s. Also, his unfavorables were in like the high 50s. Now they tend to be in the 40s to low 50s too.
1314651121948991488 2020-10-10 03:37:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @JayFiveK NH's registrations are always deeply affected by the primary there, so difficult to make snap judgments. Maine seems gone due to a very recent influx of Covid Massholes changing their primary address. ME-2 should stay loyal, though.
1314650574676205574 2020-10-10 03:34:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Sorbetti4 @davidchapman141 They tend to be more useful when neither candidate has been in office. Like 2008.
1314650318341316611 2020-10-10 03:33:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 Even so, his favorables are much better than 16. Those were truly abysmal.
1314650051898114048 2020-10-10 03:32:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads People act like these are totally independent people. Biden and Clinton were in the same Admin and have worked together for a long, long time. Clearly relevant. Clearly applicable to what a Biden Admin would look like.
1314647415228596226 2020-10-10 03:22:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReactionaryIan Some of them really did. Also a ton of ignorance on political capital and how the process works. They really expected Trump to get in a standoff with Paul Ryan to pass a RAISE Act that had no hope in the Senate anyway.
1314647102467780609 2020-10-10 03:21:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Bush did well among Hispanics because a large percentage of the Hispanic vote was in Texas and Florida. Florida Hispanics have always been more Republican. Tejanos voted for Bush because of his gubernatorial record, which bled over to New Mexico. Obama a return to norms.
1314645750991724544 2020-10-10 03:15:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @down_the_summit @SelimSeesYou Sounds like it's time to build a new bridge. I think this will occur naturally. The laws are good on unions still in most places. They can rebuild them in a fair manner if the workers want them.
1314645060529647620 2020-10-10 03:13:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @BCLive5 Just think about this: If he's not competitive in those states, it's over. He'd never give up on those states unless he was comfortable.
1314644726889488384 2020-10-10 03:11:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @down_the_summit @SelimSeesYou It's really over for Union leadership. They're basically irrelevant to the political process.
1314644631250927618 2020-10-10 03:11:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @down_the_summit @SelimSeesYou You have to recognize why a lot of the private sector union busting existed, though: It's because the GOP recognized this problem a long time ago (even before the Great Depression) and recognized the only solution was to break their power. Which they've basically done now.
1314644201523548161 2020-10-10 03:09:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @down_the_summit @SelimSeesYou Honestly think it's impossible. These people haven't been listening to their membership since the 80s and have really cemented their hold on leadership. Only new union structures could do it, but the unions do provide marginal benefits for workers so that's hard too.
1314642786092806146 2020-10-10 03:03:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK This is why I think Pence is near inevitable in 2024 if Trump wins, btw. Assuming the economy is doing great, he can run a very strong character plus "continue Trump's policies with a nice guy up top" campaign and it's going to be one tough nut to crack for anyone.
1314642334374604802 2020-10-10 03:02:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Exactly. You don't have to run on it. You just stick to the issues from the beginning. If you're going to run a character campaign, you better have the character to back it up. Better be Mike Huckabee, in other words.
1314641983504343040 2020-10-10 03:00:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @down_the_summit @SelimSeesYou Unions have been corrupt for decades. Take it from someone whose grandfather was a Union labor organizer: They care far more about advancing a leftist agenda than their workers and have for many decades now. Their workers know it too.
1314640267740352512 2020-10-10 02:53:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Look, if you're going to run as Conan the Barbarian, you have to run as Conan the Barbarian. Can't run as Mr. Nice Guy and be a total snake. Play to your strengths, boys!
1314638707929088000 2020-10-10 02:47:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 Even if Trump really is losing now (big if), all it shows is that it's relatively easy to right the ship. The fundamentals are still there for him regardless of whether voters like his tude or not.
1314635194918490112 2020-10-10 02:33:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Even Bush sent out stimulus checks in 08. Like, this isn't some new thing.
1314634385229058049 2020-10-10 02:30:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner Curious where I can buy a fascist Bible and which chapter and verse he's talking about.
1314634018118303746 2020-10-10 02:29:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FlycatcherSilky @LuisBobby3 Honestly half convinced TLP is a deep fake to soak up wine mom votes.
1314633060248363011 2020-10-10 02:25:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads MN: I think the Democrats appear to have tapped out their voting base in MSP. GOP could have juiced a lot more rural turnout.
1314632543648571393 2020-10-10 02:23:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot AK polls suck. Probably the hardest to poll in the whole country. I mean, a fifth of the population lives in the Alaskan Bush and isolated by frozen tundra.
1314632337150423041 2020-10-10 02:22:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ForceDeth76 @RedEaglePatriot I think he's saying the AK should show a much bigger Trump lead.   Not entirely convinced this is inevitable, though.
1314630659915296768 2020-10-10 02:15:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume The San Francisco political machine is the most corrupt in the country. Put nothing past these bastards. As bad as Tammany Hall ever was.
1314629203527110658 2020-10-10 02:10:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @realikamusume Really wish I got in earlier on the MAGA grifter game. Better than winning the lotto.
1314628518983204864 2020-10-10 02:07:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume In my experience, old Republicans are most likely to go like "I hate the media, polls suck, fuck Covid."
1314626702350450690 2020-10-10 02:00:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @reluctantcentr5 @Oblivion2elect1 @SelimSeesYou Also, Barnes is simply wrong that Evangelicals aren't a factor in MI, WI, and MN. MI in particular has some real hotbeds of Evangelical voters (every Evangelical book you buy has Grand Rapids, Michigan stamped as the publishing city).
1314626154255482883 2020-10-10 01:57:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @reluctantcentr5 @Oblivion2elect1 @SelimSeesYou True, but it's particularly effective in Ohio because Evangelicals are more loyal than WWC and they're a bigger share. PA it's the opposite. Why it's a bit of a harder lift.
1314625885958549509 2020-10-10 01:56:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @uhhhhhhhhhhhuh @SelimSeesYou Maybe not this election, but the country is about 37-38-25 Conservative-Moderate-Liberal with conservative and moderate trading leads. This is the long term facts. Each election is unique in terms of whose a hard supporter of each candidate.
1314625478016274433 2020-10-10 01:55:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @reluctantcentr5 @Oblivion2elect1 @realikamusume @SelimSeesYou Because the right-leaning WWC didn't show up. Reason Trump won Ohio by so much is he got the Bush Ohio coalition and drove up the WWC. Ohio GOP coalition is Evangelicals+WWC.
1314625093432213506 2020-10-10 01:53:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Yeah, you don't want to do stupid shit that drives moderates to the polls, but moderates split enough on the issues that the GOP usually can pick up enough of them if they stay on target.
1314624641315545090 2020-10-10 01:51:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Oblivion2elect1 @realikamusume @SelimSeesYou Romney barely won independents and the reason he did is that right-wing independents were scared of an Obama second term. Not quite scared enough, but scared. Trump was able to drive up their turnout in the key rust belt states in a way Romney and Bush couldn't.
1314623664806146056 2020-10-10 01:48:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Best thing Bush II did is save US Steel with a huge tariff. This is why Trump won PA. Kind of crazy to think about.
1314623392000233472 2020-10-10 01:46:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Romney, McCain, Dole, Bush I. Bush II was a base candidate, but not as effectively as Trump because he was out of touch on trade and immigration (trade he wasn't as out of touch as Romney-Ryan, though). Trump is the apotheosis of GOP base politics since 1992.
1314622900348084224 2020-10-10 01:44:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @verexel It has been crazy. There was a few years in the mid to late 2000s where it has stagnated, but that growth picked up again under Obama and has grown rapidly under Trump because no one trusts folks like CBS to tell them the truth anymore.
1314621331477008384 2020-10-10 01:38:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LVB_19 FNC has needed to go down for years. Long a stronghold for the GOP establishment and people are realizing it now that it is more brazen. Either totally purge it or just ignore it.
1314621013217378304 2020-10-10 01:37:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Simple fact is that tens of millions of people listen to conservative talk radio on a daily basis. Conservative talk radio and folks like Hannity and Tucker are more listened to than mainstream news sources. They swing elections folks. They command vast loyalties in some states.
1314620443383525378 2020-10-10 01:35:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis I've always heard Bane-er.
1314620332016361472 2020-10-10 01:34:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot The Democrats talked of a Blue Wall in the rust belt when Kerry won most of these states by less than 5 points (same with Gore), but I think sunbelt red wall was stronger than the blue wall ever was and far more relevant.
1314620037131534336 2020-10-10 01:33:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Base election and is there any doubt the conservative base is much larger than the liberal one? Has been for decades and the GOP has refused to take advantage of it.
1314618905197977600 2020-10-10 01:29:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads She's totally misrepresenting this clause on top of it.
1314618749421527042 2020-10-10 01:28:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump dunks on Paul Ryan. If nothing else, gotta thank Trump for removing that snake from national politics. Honestly preferred Boehner.
1314616321959776257 2020-10-10 01:18:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OfficialDavidNC @Turk187187 @CottoGottfried Yes. But that's what the media wants us to believe.
1314614977718820867 2020-10-10 01:13:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I want some now. Thank you. Miss old school ads from a time when we wanted our ads to be funny and over the top because we didn't need to fake normalcy.
1314614393129365505 2020-10-10 01:11:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> San Francisco political machine seems to be making big moves right now with this 25th Amendment bill and Kamala. Who really knows what's going on? Could be petty internal squabbles in the Democrat Party.
1314612957289107457 2020-10-10 01:05:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Either it was a really dumb risk, or it's a way ahead/way behind type of thing. Hoping they're just desperate to drive up their turnout, which is looking abysmal right now.
1314612090099900417 2020-10-10 01:02:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SouthernConsDem Got family who lives in the Western part. Obliged to vote that way.
1314611826093707265 2020-10-10 01:00:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried @OfficialDavidNC They're registering Republican to vote Biden. Duh!
1314611615090847744 2020-10-10 01:00:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Rush dunking on Trump for not letting Biden hang himself. Love it.
1314609686168076288 2020-10-10 00:52:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If Donald is ahead by 7 in Texas and Biden is ahead by 8 nationally, Texas is an R+15 state this election. Right now it's rated R+8.
1314608237178744834 2020-10-10 00:46:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @KingBroly People don't really know what they want on healthcare. They want their private health plans with pre-existing conditions.
1314608100628992000 2020-10-10 00:46:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @KingBroly No. Absolutely not. That isn't even the plan you're talking about and national healthcare is wildly unpopular.
1314607580627505155 2020-10-10 00:44:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly It's the most glaring GOP weakness. Need to get a better answer here.
1314604571055067136 2020-10-10 00:32:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Such brazen liars.
1314603841028083712 2020-10-10 00:29:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump mentioning chain migration. End chain migration!
1314599598133043200 2020-10-10 00:12:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KoenigJojo @SelimSeesYou Notably, I have always been against campaigning in hard left urban areas because it only serves to rally the enemy: Simply not enough people are convinced. Even if you narrow the margin by 5%, not worth the increased turnout due to net votes.
1314599345774264328 2020-10-10 00:11:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KoenigJojo @SelimSeesYou ...Given the major media market is MSP, it kind of makes sense to not advertise there. Trump nearly won MN because of a total surprise. Maybe if turnout is low in MSP and high in his areas, he sneaks a win and his ads could drive up Biden turnout.
1314599040160591874 2020-10-10 00:10:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KoenigJojo @SelimSeesYou I'm actually back and forth on MN. It really looks like the GOP has a lot of juice to squeeze even compared to 2016 in their rurals. Dems simply don't in their MSP and Iron Range strongholds: MSP was at like 80% turnout and Iron Range increase will be Trump.....
1314597598385315844 2020-10-10 00:04:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical Arizona is a state that's going to depend heavily on turnout. Need to drive those numbers up! Same with any of the swing states really, but you drive up turnout in different ways.
1314594516834418688 2020-10-09 23:52:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think it's pretty clear that AZ+PA is the easiest Trump path to 270. Like, this makes total sense. He's not pulling out of OH and IA because he's losing and wants PA instead. Also note the national ad buys.
1314593967657357319 2020-10-09 23:50:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RLTW14 @SelimSeesYou Have you even looked at state level polling for 2018? It was trash, especially in key Trump states like Florida and Ohio. PA didn't really have a competitive race, so the polls there don't even really matter.
1314593547925049347 2020-10-09 23:48:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I mean, note, a bunch of the money he has pulled out is in the lean Trump states OH and IA and he has shifted to PA and PA is likely the state that puts him over 270. I do think they're pulling out of MN, though
1314592963767476226 2020-10-09 23:46:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Because he isn't. He's still spending money there. We saw all these headlines in 2016. Like, literally all of them. I mean, I don't know, maybe, but given the likely turnout right now I'm just not seeing Trump collapsing to below McCain's vote total.
1314592395506393091 2020-10-09 23:43:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RLTW14 @SelimSeesYou Yes, but that only works across similar methodologies.
1314583304385986561 2020-10-09 23:07:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I mean, these errors shift. No one is always right every time. I remember the IBD/TIPP was spot on for both 2004 and 2008, but then missed 2012 like everyone else.

1314437451201601536 2020-10-09 13:28:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Vaiv71738794 @SelimSeesYou It actually isn’t. It is part of the 25th amendment. However, this commission would still need to pass the two thirds bar.
1314436959293632512 2020-10-09 13:26:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Pelosi and Harris are part of the same San Francisco political machine funded by the billionaire Gordon Getty. Quite possible this is a setup for removing Biden and making Kamala President. It’s a way ahead way behind kind of move, though.

1314419607189499904 2020-10-09 12:17:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The issue in the poll, I have yet to have someone explain to me what could have been done. I'm open to hearing, it's a practical issue, but I just hear a bunch of screeching about Blumpf.
1314419313881870338 2020-10-09 12:15:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou So he admits they just arbitrarily stole the institutions of learning and information without actually proving their point. A moment of honesty that they will not reflect on for one minute.
1314416547616763904 2020-10-09 12:05:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Trump wins when he hammers the issues. His selling point is "I believe what you believe and I fight everyday for it, but sometimes that looks rough."
1314416150441349120 2020-10-09 12:03:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics A lot of people are ignoring the obvious: 49% say the agree more with Trump than Biden. 46% say Biden. That's among RVs. The other question is highly susceptible to media manipulation, the second is much harder to budge.
1314413055019802627 2020-10-09 11:51:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK It's 2016 all over again, except this time with more media voter intimidation. Everyone knows you gotta double down when you lose the first time.

Had similar path to Trump's, but couldn't excite the WWC as much as Trump. If Trump gets a second term and continues and expands his first term policies, these states will be voting Republican unless the GOP totally rejects Trumpism.

Not sure without fraud they'd have gotten less than 218, though. Most of the fraud was in blue states.

Was probably a pretty lonely caucus for him. I was afraid to ask him his opinion about the election until he volunteered it.
1314319432437641217 2020-10-09 05:39:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BBoomer75 @thehangingchads Utah is a weird one because of the McMullin vote, which has virtually all come home.
1314319174903226368 2020-10-09 05:38:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> A Democrat can get away with just outright saying it: Look, you bozos, I'm not going to give my enemies fodder. Republicans need to start talking like this instead of letting Democrats ask hypotheticals about abortion laws 20 years from now.
1314319071383621635 2020-10-09 05:37:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I want to tabulate these. Might have some time over the weekend. I suspect half of national Democrat net registrants are in California.

Gentry types who made their vacation home their primary residence. The Congressional race didn't swing much at all towards the D:  https://t.co/N4SqVC3VFm
1314316654529175552 2020-10-09 05:28:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @realikamusume Yeah, I actually think that's a lot of it. Trump lost by 15 points and the Congressional race only swung 1 point to the Democrat in 2018. Seems to have swung since 2018 in any case.
1314316166249279489 2020-10-09 05:26:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @realikamusume Reasonable. I suspect a lot of it is Massholes escaping the rona.
1314315443348353024 2020-10-09 05:23:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @lthomps54 @realikamusume In Presidential years, the Republican vote total tracks very well with their registered vote total. The Democrat total doesn't. Still, a reasonable worst case scenario for Democrat seems 8-6 million with low Dem turnout and Indies swinging heavily against the Dems.
1314314861820739584 2020-10-09 05:20:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @realikamusume NH appears to be due to the primary this year. So, will come down to turnout.
1314314280578224128 2020-10-09 05:18:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @realikamusume Maine 1 has swung heavily to the left. Maine 2 seems to have remained stable. Kind of odd.
1314313393763954697 2020-10-09 05:15:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Once you get in, you only get kicked out quickly if you're total Republican-leaning hot garbage. It Trump wins, I think Bevan will likely start purging a lot of these trash firms.
1314312247875973120 2020-10-09 05:10:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Democrats have registered like 1.5-2 million new voters in California since 2016. This accounts for a ridiculous percentage of national Democratic growth. I think Biden wins California 9-10 million to 5 million: Truly crazy numbers.
1314311330145411072 2020-10-09 05:06:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 @ruintal @SelimSeesYou I think what happens is young people express a preference for the Democrats due to education presenting a very favorable perspective on them. When they actually start voting, they vote more on present issues and expressed their real preference.
1314310674974089216 2020-10-09 05:04:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 @ruintal @SelimSeesYou Yeah, the adult population has a lot of people who say they're Democrats, but don't care at all. I'm not really sure about the dynamics of this. Some of it might be minority voter low participation rates and some of it is false preference while voters express more revealed pref.
1314310268856475660 2020-10-09 05:02:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 Everything is so disingenuous now. It's quite obvious she was never in any real danger.
1314305950879227906 2020-10-09 04:45:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jcbonthedl @SelimSeesYou Remember when we could make jokes about this stuff and not have our careers threatened by a violent mob?
1314303605281894400 2020-10-09 04:36:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton I want to believe, but it is possible they're doing this to get their girl Harris in after the election. Pelosi is also a member of the San Francisco Gordon Getty machine.
1314302551496495111 2020-10-09 04:32:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou This was a really easy job back in the days of Gallup random dial methods and everyone having a landline. It has gotten harder since 2008 when that wasn't the case.
1314302194691252232 2020-10-09 04:30:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou He really gets down into the weeds with it. The problem with polling is that the electorate is self-selected. Determining who is actually a member of the group of people who show and vote is important business and the mainstream pollsters aren't giving straight answers right now.
1314298920504381441 2020-10-09 04:17:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiahgameking2 @thehangingchads Certainly not. However, given Hispanic participation rates, it isn't really the end of the universe as long as they can secure enough of the White vote. Hispanic voting trends tend to merge with White voting trends over generations too. Cutting it off now and it's salvagable.
1314296795070164992 2020-10-09 04:09:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Notably, under any circumstance, the 25th Amendment cannot be invoked permanently without the consent of two-thirds of both Houses of Congress. So, if the President disputes the findings of this "commission," the commission needs two thirds of both Houses to agree.
1314296137122275329 2020-10-09 04:06:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Relevant clause: "Thereafter, when the President transmits...his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless...or of such other body as Congress may by law provide."
1314295087480934400 2020-10-09 04:02:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Number of votes Whitmer got in Michigan: 2,266,193  Number of votes Trump received: 2,279,543  Evidence is Trump is more popular in Michigan than she is.
1314294705027534856 2020-10-09 04:00:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Oh, look, another politician throwing out every canned word to throw at Trump because "hate." So sick of this crap. How about the hate the media has for White working class voters in your state, Gretchen?
1314287862867808257 2020-10-09 03:33:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We need to have a national conversation about how divorced women project their personal struggles onto national political figures.
1314286089566330880 2020-10-09 03:26:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Texas is narrowing less because of Hispanics and more the high concentration of wealthy divorced college women in the Dallas and Houston suburbs.
1314281460212342784 2020-10-09 03:08:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner It really is mostly ignoramuses talking about things they don't know about based on their own personal biases. So many people apply their own personal struggles to national politics it's ridiculous, especially in countries the size of most nation states.
1314280283991158784 2020-10-09 03:03:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @NoctRomaRTW Hillary could at least tap into some of her husband's popularity and the woman thing. Biden has nothing going for him after Trump robbed his base.
1314278001589321732 2020-10-09 02:54:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ruintal @SelimSeesYou Pennsylvania Dems have a high defection rate (have for a LONG time) and they also don't show up. Republicans in Pennsylvania show up. Indies tend to lean Republican, but that could have changed.
1314277675700310021 2020-10-09 02:53:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ruintal @SelimSeesYou Loyal Reps had outstanding turnout for a midterm incumbent party. Only D+4 compared to D+3 in 16. Pennsylvania is unique, but nationally the vote will come down to whether right-leaning indies show up.

1314274126341832712 2020-10-09 02:39:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical @CottoGottfried Trump might shine in the townhall format, though.
1314273459221008386 2020-10-09 02:36:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @uhhhhhhhhhhhuh @SelimSeesYou You also just have to think in terms of raw votes: People registering as Republicans translate into some percentage of raw votes for Trump.
1314273288676409344 2020-10-09 02:35:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @uhhhhhhhhhhhuh @SelimSeesYou They typically do swing against the incumbent party too. Left-leaning indies appear to have been more energized than right-leaning indies as well.
1314272251160793089 2020-10-09 02:31:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Registrations matter more in Presidential years because more people vote and the reasons Dems took the House is an independent swing against Republicans. A split decision among indies would have been a GOP hold.
1314265000383516675 2020-10-09 02:02:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical She's just extremely unlikable.
1314264268989227009 2020-10-09 01:59:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The traditional wisdom is a VP can't help much, but it can hurt you. Kamala Harris's favorability hurts Biden. Just a fact. Pence probably is a net plus for Trump, even if marginal. Just a fact.
1314262518261600256 2020-10-09 01:52:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads The divorced wine aunt and mom vote who, if they have kids, are hated by their own children.

1314250069084962819 2020-10-09 01:03:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Those 32% new voter polls are literally physically impossible.
1314249933508300806 2020-10-09 01:02:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume 90th percentile turnout is like 150 million. 140-145 million is reasonable.
1314248735124262918 2020-10-09 00:58:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads So confusing.
1314245011119255560 2020-10-09 00:43:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Why can’t Trump do a virtual debate if he does a virtual rally?  Because we only get three debates and part of the debate is the human interaction between the participants. Duh.
1314232762367344648 2020-10-08 23:54:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PerfInjust This is the conservatism of meaningless institutionalism.
1314231893932548096 2020-10-08 23:51:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Busing not mentioned. Pence old enough to remember everyone thought that was a shit policy.
1314229805634727938 2020-10-08 23:42:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 Yeah, I think Trump’s style works in a lot of ways. 90% of the problems it creates would go away if the GOP would just circle their wagons when he’s attacked for it and the other 10 is just margin of error.
1314228625756037125 2020-10-08 23:38:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mauritaniadan @thehangingchads @SelimSeesYou It’s the number one chink in their armor. Typical imperial hubris. And for no real reason either. Elections show they’re wildly unpopular and they only win when the Republican candidate is even more unpopular.

1314205914577006600 2020-10-08 22:08:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Cruz was the only other one who could have won that primary. Rubio third maybe, but he would have been a dud.
1314205331065466885 2020-10-08 22:05:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> One of the cringier takes of the dissident right was that only Trump could have won the 2016 race. I mean, the only reason the Republicans lost 2012 was because Mitt Romney sucked. I voted Trump for other reasons in the primary.
1314197679354806273 2020-10-08 21:35:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @Davelevy23 Well, that’s because Richmond and Fairfax hold back their vote so they can print any ballots they need.
1314196101885558785 2020-10-08 21:29:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @Davelevy23 Does no one remember that Pennsylvania was initially reporting 70-30 for Clinton when the polls first closed? That was the mail in vote.
1314186261180096512 2020-10-08 20:49:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The only reason they though Kamala did well at first was the whole covid BS, but I think Pence did an effective job on that.

1314079166145409024 2020-10-08 13:44:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical He was from a school of Republicanism where you had to run a positive campaign to win. McCain was from this school too, but he at least knew to pick Palin to get conservatives on board.
1314078683456569345 2020-10-08 13:42:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical He was an old school Eisenhower Republican running 36 years after the sell by date and Kemp was just bad on every level. Don’t even know if he really attacked Clinton, which he needed to do to drag Clinton’s sky high approval down.

1314070661527203840 2020-10-08 13:10:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CanisAzureus @SelimSeesYou Yeah, Pence handled it with grace. Trump’s approach is high risk/high reward, Pence’s risk is more subdued, but it can pay off enough to win. Harris mostly did herself in, which helped a lot.
1314070218692538369 2020-10-08 13:08:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @AnglicanMan19 They’re not interested in debate rules and it was obvious the moderator was biased. While she wasn’t as bad as Wallace, she did cut off Pence far earlier than Kamala. Playing by these rules is the way Republicans lose. Proof is in the pudding.
1314063774802948096 2020-10-08 12:43:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I remember Kamala taking a bunch of notes and crap the whole debate. Didn't see Pence doing that. Maybe I just missed it, but definitely gotta respect boss mode where you just go off feel.
1314063519973888000 2020-10-08 12:42:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @AnglicanMan19 Literally no one cares about that stuff. For the most part, Pence was substantive and direct. He only completely evaded a few obviously twisted questions and the pre-existing conditions thing. That's what voters care about.
1314062404117028864 2020-10-08 12:37:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @AnglicanMan19 Democrat voters and donors think so. She went from a high of 17% in the primaries, definitely a top tier contender, to like 2% and dropping out because the donors knew she was a loser.
1314061410381574146 2020-10-08 12:33:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou Thankfully most people still don't live in that alternate reality. Unfortunately, not all of us in the real world are convinced of just how insane the left has become.
1314060063561207809 2020-10-08 12:28:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou No one remembers the moment, but they will remember their impression that Kamala Harris spent 90 minutes being a total bitch and the other guy seemed pretty nice.
1314058487664648193 2020-10-08 12:22:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Can't hug your wife in public without wearing a mask. This is the Democrat platform in 2020.

1314056309466071040 2020-10-08 12:13:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I mean, really, they're really saying she won? And you wonder why I don't buy polls.
1314055934432415744 2020-10-08 12:12:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If this is the road we're going to go down, why don't we just pass another amendment revoking men's right to vote? Apparently we're not allowed to have an opinion. It's "mansplaining."
1314044087528501249 2020-10-08 11:24:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 She didn’t even make it to Iowa. Joe Biden did the same thing in 1988 and it took 20 years, a Vice Presidency, and Donald Trump getting elected to even have a chance at the nomination. Total AA candidate. If they win this year, though, yeah, she’ll still lose the General.

1314042517537599489 2020-10-08 11:18:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 She won’t win the primary. Not even Dem voters really like her that much.

1313970122634256386 2020-10-08 06:31:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @SelbJim @NoctRomaRTW @CottoGottfried Before 2008 the conventional wisdom was to build a war chest and dump it on ads in the battlegrounds. This kind of worked, but it hit diminishing marginal turns fast when Obama rejected FEC funds for his campaign and opened the dam for billion plus dollar Prez races.
1313969415675879430 2020-10-08 06:28:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @realikamusume @NoctRomaRTW @CottoGottfried I don’t think that’s quite true, even though it’s close. I think they work in small doses early in the cycle to reinforce base voter enthusiasm and define the election. The old school method of dumping shit tons of money on ads in September/October was dumb.
1313965779323424769 2020-10-08 06:13:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou No, by that token Biden looks to be "in retreat" too in some places. I think it's just that the game evolved: October money is better spent on turnout and lawyering up if that's necessary. Campaign ads work better when the money is spent in small doses months earlier.
1313965038798020612 2020-10-08 06:10:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou No, not really for the exact reason you cited. Money has diminishing returns in politics and we used to be capped well below that diminishing returns limit, but we clearly hit it really quick when Obama opened the dam on unlimited campaign spending.
1313964506549301248 2020-10-08 06:08:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WesternCath @SelimSeesYou We're winning the grifter battle!
1313964132107005953 2020-10-08 06:07:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> A lot of people talking about the money game today with all the ad stuff. Just a friendly reminder that one reason elections have gotten so expensive since 2008 is because Obama declined FEC matching funds that year. The Citizens United decision only added to that.
1313963075360493571 2020-10-08 06:03:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @onewalleee The traditional method of campaigning was to dump a shit ton of money into ads in swing states a month before the election. I think someone realized that shit don't work and you should spend a little over several months and then dump all the money on turnout.
1313961231045275648 2020-10-08 05:55:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Good to hear.

1313956070906376193 2020-10-08 05:35:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @iChanticleer Trump excited the right people: People who don't normally show up. All the people he didn't excite among Republicans always show up anyway. Reverse problem with HW in 92.   I mentioned earlier today: Perot is evidence people still hated Democrats in 1992 despite not liking HW.

Everyone read it as "THIS IS THE END FOR BLUMPH" because he lost it by like 3 points. A state that had picked the big loser two times in a row. Then he crushed in NH and SC and the narrative was "the field is divided!"

1313954499397120011 2020-10-08 05:28:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @iChanticleer @thehangingchads 1992 it kind of does because people weren't really enthusiastic about either candidate. Clinton got in during the most chaotic election of modern time before Trump. Hadn't seen an election like that since 1912.

It is possible Trump gets 90 among Republicans, 10 among Democrats, and narrowly wins Indies in a D+3 electorate. These things don't happen in a vacuum and all these groups can shift independently.
1313952460231372801 2020-10-08 05:20:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Bankers100 @davidchapman141 On a bad night, he'll get 90. On a good night 96. So, yeah.

For one thing, no one on Earth lives up to their potential. Secondly, @onewalleee is pointing to tangible accomplishments people just denounce as "not good enough" without a second thought.
1313949889588539398 2020-10-08 05:10:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CRASHjesterTV @onewalleee Ann has been an outrage merchant for so long she doesn't know how to do anything else at this point. I've been suspicious of her political instincts since she backed Mitt Romney in 2008, though, solely because of a meaningless EO Mitt did against illegals as Governor of Mass.
1313947401619755008 2020-10-08 05:00:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Barnes_Law @NoctRomaRTW Looks like they're polling counties in Ohio that only made up about half the electorate to the point of 2:1. I'm including a couple of the GOP suburbs it looks like they polled.

Just not buying that narrative. We don't have September's numbers: At the end of August Trump was sitting on 150 million to Joe's 220, though. Hardly disastrous for Trump.

There were mainline-ish Southern denominations that no longer exist and the SBC was classified with them, then Evangelical, now they're trending back.
1313925386330427392 2020-10-08 03:33:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Combined with a long term Hispanic trend to the GOP, this is the last election Democrats have to arrest a semi-permanent governing coalition for Republicans at the Presidential level. 2024 will be worse for them.
1313925052665036802 2020-10-08 03:31:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Simply put: Republicans are energizing the White working class to vote for them at a much faster rate than Democrats are turning educated Whites and minorities to turn out.
1313924532542021632 2020-10-08 03:29:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK I pulled this back to 2004: Republicans have been favored in it the vast majority of the time (save 2008). However, I do think this is indicative of the long term realignment we have seen toward the Republican Party among White Working Class voters.
1313922298055925767 2020-10-08 03:21:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK "I want to be a Republican so I can....vote for Joe Biden?" Yeah, that's not happening folks. You heard it from me. We're going to win bigly!
1313921524508884995 2020-10-08 03:17:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @redN4C @KingFrenly Yeah, even when it's just a cold, I tend to be like "the cold's going around in my house." Most people don't really care, but it's helpful to know if someone has something going on and they can't risk getting a cold.
1313919031234170884 2020-10-08 03:08:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee Trump didn't sign on for throwing swastikas on the Lincoln Memorial. Clearly he's just another ZOG plot.
1313915141898018821 2020-10-08 02:52:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 I mean, Alf Landon got 36.5%. ALF LANDON.
1313914704918708225 2020-10-08 02:50:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 You can technically say this about races going back like 150 years. Since the Civil War, the only time a party has slipped below a third of the vote was the really bizarre 1912 race. So, at least 2/3 people are loyal voters: Democrat or Republican.
1313910189297414144 2020-10-08 02:32:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Wow. If the affair didn't move the needle, this will. That's just really shitty.
1313902730134593536 2020-10-08 02:03:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads He's old. Maybe he just wants to put it all one red one more time.
1313897038208172045 2020-10-08 01:40:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DonTheSEODude @trutsle @davidchapman141 Doubt that for Rasmussen. I just think Rasmussen is incredibly lazy these days.
1313895698904080391 2020-10-08 01:35:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CKaliszeski @JamesGa58897950 @RedEaglePatriot They lean that way more than blue and swing states, but some more than others. Many are just so solidly Republican that only a horrific corruption scandal can undo the Republican candidate. Also depends on if the candidate is running on values.
1313894508547973121 2020-10-08 01:30:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JamesGa58897950 @CKaliszeski @RedEaglePatriot Clinton wasn't a values candidate.   Also, John Edwards much? Also a Senator from North Carolina, a values state, btw.
1313894186509271040 2020-10-08 01:29:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot @Remstreamt Literally all ex-wives do that shit.
1313893874142793730 2020-10-08 01:28:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @realikamusume CNN literally did that.
1313892762115280896 2020-10-08 01:23:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @realikamusume Pollsters are people too and they are also subject to confirmation bias. A responsible, honest pollster tries to correct for that. Given the rhetoric these pollsters believe about "Trump dictator! Trump bad!" it's really unsurprising they don't question their first instincts.
1313891842321248257 2020-10-08 01:20:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @realikamusume I've never seen polls this all over the place. The only explanation I have for it is that it seems likely the Trump base is even harder to poll than 2016 and that shows up more in national numbers than state numbers. That's assuming honesty on their part, which I don't anymore.
1313891049081888768 2020-10-08 01:16:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @realikamusume Instinct rules, my friend. People vote on gut for the most part. Polls are useful, but the top lines are just trash used to generate headlines. Have been for a long time. Even when they favor Republicans.
1313890584944349192 2020-10-08 01:15:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Remove the USC Trump+ 3 poll and it's off by two points. Incorporate the fact they underpolled California and New York and it's off by like three.
1313889696477597697 2020-10-08 01:11:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Like saying "the only poll that matters is election day" isn't an uncommon opinion in this country. Notably, it has the truth on its side.
1313889551757303808 2020-10-08 01:10:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume The average normie believes all sorts of weird shit people in power don't want him to believe. We have this vision of normies as these people who buy all narratives, but that's just liberals and leftists.
1313888935974703106 2020-10-08 01:08:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Typical of Rasmussen. I'd take them off RCP. They aren't the outfit they once were.
1313888535934627841 2020-10-08 01:06:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Honestly, Biden appear to be underperforming among Democrats too in this poll. Most polls have him with around 90%. The Indie thing: A lot of polls are showing it, I'm not buying it.
1313887018900959232 2020-10-08 01:00:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Clinton is also like the only President in modern history to underperform his approval rating during his re-election attempt.
1313886824222330881 2020-10-08 01:00:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed I think the whole Perot phenomenon indicated people didn’t really want to turn to the Democrats in 92, though. I think Clinton would have won regardless, but it wouldn’t have been the downright embarrassing showing for an incumbent it was.
1313883982010949634 2020-10-08 00:48:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @risengrind1231 @Sdraid13 @NationalistTV Virginia will join. After all, we have a grudge from calling in vain in the Late Unpleasantness.
1313880160685490182 2020-10-08 00:33:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump still excites these people to get out and vote and he has accomplishments. Biden promises nothing but the loss of their jobs and their way of life. Even an establishmentarian like Bush nearly won on this. Trump isn't that.
1313879962966011904 2020-10-08 00:32:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> People keep contrasting Trump with Bush, but Bush nearly won the rust belt too. In fact, he outperformed Trump in a lot of places. Why? Because these union workers have known for decades the Democrats no longer stand with them and they have known that since Clinton and NAFTA.
1313879603396726785 2020-10-08 00:31:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Polls do not indicate people support what Biden claims to stand for. As we near election day, that becomes more obvious. This is one reason I believe Republicans have dominated election day voting since 2004.
1313879444910637057 2020-10-08 00:30:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This was easily predictable to anyone who actually knows how people work. The same thing will happen with these Trump double digit polls: They will narrow and the fundamentals will play a role: Do you actually want to vote for Biden?
1313879239456948228 2020-10-08 00:29:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> However, what wasn't debatable is this electorate was overwhelmingly Christian and dogmatically against it. So, when actually confronted with the choice "Hey, do I actually want to vote for something that I don't believe in on a core, fundamental level?" they said no.
1313879059013738496 2020-10-08 00:29:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Because people expressed a false preference. They said they were ok with gays marrying. Maybe, on some level, they are. It doesn't affect them, right? Well, that was debatable.
1313878750233325569 2020-10-08 00:27:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I like this because it's a pure issue: People don't really change their mind on the issues very often. People change their minds about people a lot more. So why did the polls miss this by double digits (Favor won by 5)?
1313878514471522304 2020-10-08 00:27:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Here's why you really need to ignore polls. Races come down to turnout and fundamentals. People express false preferences. Sometimes to the tune of double digits. Here are the polls for the 2008 California gay marriage referendum. It's a perfect example. Thread.  https://t.co/DTegltADFk
1313877236362117120 2020-10-08 00:21:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @president4hunn1 @RealAPolitics What Pelosi wanted is unacceptable.
1313876213103030273 2020-10-08 00:17:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @president4hunn1 @RealAPolitics He never came out against stimulus. Did you even read the tweet?
1313875266104590337 2020-10-08 00:14:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Everyone in the know knows this round of polling is just preference falsification cuz "Covid bad!"
1313874527257059330 2020-10-08 00:11:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan Seriously, it should have been a very average midterm all things considered.
1313874380674527232 2020-10-08 00:10:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Like, if the President was on the ballot in 2018, he would have lost incredibly narrowly.
1313874050935029761 2020-10-08 00:09:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Can I just remind everyone Republicans had a better night than people thought in 2018? Like, they gained 2 seats in the Senate (would have been 3 sans Arizona steal) and lost the House because of a typical Independent swing against the incumbent party.
1313872852798537728 2020-10-08 00:04:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Rasmussen does not normally overestimate Republicans that much more than everyone else.
1313872514637074433 2020-10-08 00:03:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV Oh, yeah, Maryland sucks.
1313872423398277120 2020-10-08 00:02:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Doesn't it occur to you that there's no way this is possible with state level polling we are seeing? Rasmussen does not lean insanely far right in their actual top line numbers.
1313871927124152321 2020-10-08 00:00:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV So, he's on track for nearly the exact same performance he had in 2016?  https://t.co/dUGKUrhmyr
1313869726121066496 2020-10-07 23:52:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates That's part of it, but this exists on the official level far more on the right. The right is simply far more divided than the left is. The right is far more principled: Like I've been saying: A lot on the right are aggressively right on one issue to the point of myopia.
1313869317017141248 2020-10-07 23:50:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads They simply don't believe it. They live in such an echo chamber they won't even consider contradictory facts.

1313863083681558535 2020-10-07 23:25:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads You mean, the guy who plagiarized Neil Kinnock is plagiarizing BoJo now?

1313856854779453441 2020-10-07 23:00:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads They don't argue it. They just assert it.
1313850906488832000 2020-10-07 22:37:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK John Kerry ran this campaign and....I guess we had a President Kerry?
1313850206824341506 2020-10-07 22:34:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics They're really banking on 2:1 suburban college women margins.
1313849918038118403 2020-10-07 22:33:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @CottoGottfried People like Ann Coulter and Girdusky just don't get that they won. They've been psychologically marred by fighting on the outside for so long. Particularly Ann. The Republican Party looks a lot more like what Ann Coulter wanted, so they've found a new reason to complain.
1313836830110998529 2020-10-07 21:41:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I really don't get the weirdos who get angry over Trump tweeting stuff like this.
1313712645950910465 2020-10-07 13:27:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BiglyMemed @MemedBigly @RealAPolitics If that’s going to happen, I think it happens regardless of the outcome unless someone wins in a landslide, that being a relative term.
1313711181933273088 2020-10-07 13:22:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MemedBigly @RealAPolitics One way is Trump wins PA, loses the rest of the rust belt, loses Arizona, holds Nebraska 2 and Maine 2. Also wins Arizona, wins either NE-2 or ME-2 and then wins WI or MN.
1313701003842260996 2020-10-07 12:41:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @SelimSeesYou Her only prayer of winning the seat is Trump winning the state by 5+ points and dragging her two points behind.
1313700483731804165 2020-10-07 12:39:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou So odd. Even the polls with Trump down like 10 in the states showed her doing WORSE.
1313700086942175233 2020-10-07 12:38:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV Damn I hope this press conference is good. The debate should be good regardless.
1313699394869514240 2020-10-07 12:35:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PstafarianPrice @ded_ruckus Thank you. I will use this to justify the purchase of my next firearm.
1313697749917929472 2020-10-07 12:28:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @thehangingchads I mean, my guts have always told me to not trust these people, but this stuff just helps you realize how deeply cynical these politicians are.
1313696441882357760 2020-10-07 12:23:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @4dchessmaster1 @LarrySchweikart Please tell me she brought up his gun control policies.

1313691200789131264 2020-10-07 12:02:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee The 9th Circuit is almost a miracle. If Trump gets another term, it will flip totally. Will be a huge victory in the long run. Big time winning right there.
1313676988973019136 2020-10-07 11:06:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Another thing about Obamacare: So many conservatives noted that there was no way it could work and the Democrat play here was obviously an attempt to make universal healthcare more popular later. Lo and behold we now have “right wing” people begging for national healthcare.
1313675269362929664 2020-10-07 10:59:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat Remember that time David Koch was the LP’s VP?
1313674726993207297 2020-10-07 10:57:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Obamacare sucks. It’s literally the worst of both worlds.
1313674119439843328 2020-10-07 10:54:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton CNN poll! We are doomed! Cope! Poll unskewing!

1313659532548030471 2020-10-07 09:56:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TitanSteel3 @DavidAFoshee @CottoGottfried Where is this myth coming from? Trump has 150 million at the end of August and I guarantee he had some bomb fundraising numbers on some days in September.
1313659334845444097 2020-10-07 09:56:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAFoshee @CottoGottfried The House and you want to stay on the air a little just to keep people engaged if there’s any chance later. Biden has more money than he knows what to do with. So does Trump.
1313659135339180033 2020-10-07 09:55:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Stupid Rasmussen paywall. I can somewhat believe the race is at Biden 51-43 right now, though. Will that be where it is when Election Day arrives? No, but maybe right now.
1313649545553874945 2020-10-07 09:17:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Indian_Bronson You think they don’t do this in the Emirates? Boy do I have news.
1313648352312143873 2020-10-07 09:12:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @NationalistTV @SelimSeesYou Florida is always key. Sealing that for Republicans really narrows the Democrat path.
1313648092454039553 2020-10-07 09:11:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV @realikamusume @SelimSeesYou @trafalgar_group This race is going to come down to turnout and late deciders in the rust belt. There’s a small alternative path for Biden by winning Arizona and NE-2 and only losing one rust belt state, but that would be a real odd one.
1313646694203088896 2020-10-07 09:05:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @NationalistTV @SelimSeesYou Obviously Liberty is in Virginia, but we were a small and very reliable voting group. Needed to be in Loudoun, Hillsborough, and Cleveland suburbs.
1313646451981942784 2020-10-07 09:04:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @NationalistTV @SelimSeesYou I remember knowing Romney was going to lose the election because he came to visit Liberty University the day before the 2012 election and was flying to Penn the next day. It was obvious that election would be decided in OH, VA, and FL. Made no sense.
1313644814357929985 2020-10-07 08:58:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV @realikamusume @SelimSeesYou Like, it actually sucks that Rasmussen is the only GOP firm still polling because they actually do suck and Scott Rasmussen doesn’t even work there anymore. However, they don’t suck any more than polls CNN released today.
1313644099040423936 2020-10-07 08:55:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV @realikamusume @SelimSeesYou But you’ll buy a poll that overestimated Dems by the same election by 7? Be consistent: That’s all I ask of people.
1313642540046876673 2020-10-07 08:49:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV @realikamusume @SelimSeesYou There have been races where Rasmussen underestimated the GOP. The overestimated Romney, but so did everyone.
1313642322140319750 2020-10-07 08:48:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV @realikamusume @SelimSeesYou The main difference is the only Republican leaning poll still polling is Rasmussen, which is at Biden+8. No evidence they actually have a huge Republican lean in results.
1313638851055845378 2020-10-07 08:34:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RiddleguyMan @onewalleee Convinced half the reason Trump eked our a win is all the dispirited folks who regretted not voting for Mitt and ending up with another four horrible years of Obama.
1313631015777247233 2020-10-07 08:03:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FlycatcherSilky I'm really ok with all this nonsense in off years and behind the scenes. When you fully admit you know that Trump is the better option and you're still criticizing everything in public, knowing the stakes, you're just proving that you're not a team player.
1313629806165217280 2020-10-07 07:58:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @piccorojoey @davidchapman141 Someone hasn't looked up 1876: The most obviously rigged election in American history.   It's probable JQ Adams made a deal with Clay to appoint him Secretary of State for his support, but this is just the way politics works. There's nothing corrupt about it.
1313628863377879040 2020-10-07 07:55:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @piccorojoey @davidchapman141 It was resolved in the constitutional manner.
1313628176669646848 2020-10-07 07:52:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's really annoying being on the side of the political aisle that doesn't realize politics is a team sport.
1313627610077954048 2020-10-07 07:50:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @davidchapman141 I honestly do believe Trump could execute stuff a better (can't we all?), but there's just so much criticism about every minor misstep. I've seen horrific gaffes that lost elections criticized less than Trump's word choice and tone sometimes.
1313625897220608000 2020-10-07 07:43:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is literally like 90% of the arguments lefties make.
1313625109865869314 2020-10-07 07:40:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee @emmy600 This bill was all sorts of awful. There was no middle ground. Reasonable middle ground was print a bunch of checks and move on, but Dems refused to even talk about that.
1313624309328490496 2020-10-07 07:36:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee NatPop grifters are just how the Democrats responded to Trump, knowing they couldn’t directly attempt to appeal to working class Whites anymore.
1313616749020033025 2020-10-07 07:06:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK But someone discovered the word “cope” in the past few years and gave it a negative connotation.
1313604333141884929 2020-10-07 06:17:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @calm_normal @JayFiveK I’m convinced the olds are going to come home anyway for exactly the reason you state: Disproportionately stuck at home scared left-leaning boomers. Right leaning boomers are like “fuck polls.”
1313603769758814208 2020-10-07 06:15:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Yeah, but there’s supposed to be 32% new voters!
1313602793081634821 2020-10-07 06:11:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MaritimeLoyal What is up with Atlantic Canada? Why is it so far to the left of the rest of Canada?
1313600339472510982 2020-10-07 06:01:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OakenOdyssey Oh, yeah, I did after finding it.
1313598984481574913 2020-10-07 05:56:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All this speculation about not knowing the election results for weeks just seems to be more of the same hyperbole we have experienced throughout the Trump era.
1313598555530186758 2020-10-07 05:54:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OakenOdyssey Found it.
1313596150080057347 2020-10-07 05:45:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Wow. They're trying it again? They already got let off. Double jeopardy much?
1313589609520037890 2020-10-07 05:19:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation 2/2 The ridiculous Dem polls aren't counterbalanced this cycle with polls that oversample Republican leaners either like it was in 2016. Some of those same polls are now heavily Democrat (USC/Dornsife being a huge offender here).
1313589349213143041 2020-10-07 05:18:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation This is why Baris has been saying you really have to discount the average this time. You're comparing extremely different electorates across all of these polls. Some truly ridiculous like CNN's poll today with a 28% Republican national electorate. 1/2
1313585018346901506 2020-10-07 05:00:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rufus38605416 @realikamusume Crude, but I honestly think he's just trying to get into Krystal's pants.
1313582198910521351 2020-10-07 04:49:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Lawyers are expected to take cases pro bono. This is just an expectation in some fields.

1313578865978155008 2020-10-07 04:36:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There's this psycho who keeps blocking me and then unblocks me to get to vent aggression and then blocks me again. Toxic individual. Hopefully I can catch it next time and render them permablocked.

1313575576033206274 2020-10-07 04:23:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> You know, Virginia kind of makes it a pain in the ass to find out what's actually going to be on the ballot. Or at least Fairfax County does.
1313574050397065217 2020-10-07 04:17:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @animegorilla @SelimSeesYou Seriously, Pence is going to wreck it tomorrow night. He's an old school budget dweeb too, so he knows this process in and out from his time as Chair of the House Republican Conference.
1313571274229264386 2020-10-07 04:06:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner Neither do I, but you clearly don't understand Trump doesn't have the capacity to actually pull that off. Like I said, I'm willing to follow him if he crosses the Rubicon, but it's quite clear he won't, and maybe he can't. You just have to deal with the facts at some point.
1313570924474568711 2020-10-07 04:04:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics Imagine the kvetching from the likes of Girudusky when the Trump Legions lose a battle (it's going to happen, folks!)? They'll think it's over the moment the first MAGA brigade is forced to surrender.
1313570503727165447 2020-10-07 04:03:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics This is weakest ass bitch team in history and they're all demanding Trump becomes a dictator with it. Who would go to war with this band of blackpilling bozos who buy the media narrative at first glance every time?
1313570095340412930 2020-10-07 04:01:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner You can't have an honest election if you do something like this.
1313569742700122112 2020-10-07 04:00:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @evelyn_waugh1 Teddy Roosevelt didn't make appropriations without Congressional approval.
1313569309441089537 2020-10-07 03:58:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner This doesn't win him the election itself. If he wants to go balls to the wall, I'll follow, but it has to be BALLS TO THE WALL.

1313569085809188866 2020-10-07 03:57:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If Trump once the cross the Rubicon, I'm 110% willing to follow him, but he can't pussyfoot around in it half assed.
1313568707160035328 2020-10-07 03:55:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Once again, we have politically ignorant right wingers on the timeline demanding Trump assume dictatorial powers to solve a temporary political problem. This isn't about principle or even the law, it's just dumb on every level unless Trump is willing to go full bore.
1313568220868214785 2020-10-07 03:54:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner That doesn't work:  https://t.co/8LXrwEfskC
1313568103427723269 2020-10-07 03:53:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner It cannot be done. There is nowhere to obtain this money. This money doesn't exist in the first place. The only way to make it exist is to print new bonds and the bonds have to be authorized by Congress, and if the Prez lose that battle, it would kill America's prime credit.
1313567376907079683 2020-10-07 03:50:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> For all those blackpilling about Trump saying he's not negotiating any further with Democrats: Stop. All appropriations fights get turned against the GOP regardless of facts in the media. What was he supposed to do? Not say anything? Continue fruitless, dishonest negotiations?
1313566819429625856 2020-10-07 03:48:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner There's just nowhere to draw hundreds of billions like that from already made appropriations.
1313566597450289153 2020-10-07 03:47:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner Article I, Section 9, Clause VII: "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time."
1313562353712193539 2020-10-07 03:30:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat No one relevant is opposed to direct payments, but Dems are holding them hostage to bailout their shit states and make Trump look bad in the process.
1313560496973459456 2020-10-07 03:23:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CommonM24045307 @realikamusume UBI is not popular. It's also an insanely bad policy.
1313559867970420738 2020-10-07 03:20:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CommonM24045307 @realikamusume I wouldn't call supporting infrastructure projects moving left. I mean, one of the wonders of the modern world isn't called the "Hoover Dam" for nothing. This is just traditional conservative politics.
1313558810678775811 2020-10-07 03:16:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat They want jobs. They want to lead happy, healthy, fulfilling lives. They want what literally every human being wants. This doesn't happen by printing money for some dumb stimulus scheme for poorly ran blue states that kill jobs and kill working families.
1313558442330779651 2020-10-07 03:15:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat So out of touch with Trumpists. So out of touch with actual blue collar populists. So out of touch with what it means to be an American, or just any Anglo-Saxon anywhere. Americans don't just want to be handed checks from big daddy government and they never have.
1313557358837141506 2020-10-07 03:10:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat Dude's a snake and has zero grasp on the Trump base or what got him elected.
1313553789010485249 2020-10-07 02:56:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III The reason for this goes back a long way to when the Democrats were the party of states rights and decentralized power. That typically meant opposing statehood in the territories. That's one reason the mountain and plains states lean so heavily Republican.
1313553326009712640 2020-10-07 02:54:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SouthernConsDem A Wyoming county with the murder rate of a country facing a low level civil war. And a few weird plotlines.    I like it, though.
1313550067857608706 2020-10-07 02:41:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee Everyone knows who they are. Many forget that at the end of the day all of this is just people doing what people do. The propagandists dehumanize the admin in the extreme and perpetuate false media narratives for their grift.
1313548913144745985 2020-10-07 02:37:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Str8Don @SelimSeesYou @ShapiroBenjamin Yes, it became pretty clear that you either fell in line with the Trump way of doing business or voters would punish you harshly. The stubborn RINOs didn't even have the balls to face the electorate: True cowards.
1313548433924542465 2020-10-07 02:35:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @onewalleee The blackpillers and, at this point, rank slanderers have really gotten on my nerves. They prey on people's complete lack of knowledge of the political process and tendency to view political issues myopically.
1313547491099451393 2020-10-07 02:31:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad Yeah, well, this poll is also total trash. So, grain of salt lol.
1313545725511381000 2020-10-07 02:24:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> #StopTheSteal
1313544765103902720 2020-10-07 02:20:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV @SelimSeesYou The one competitive poll was 44-40 Warner. Final result: 49.1-48.3 Warner with all the fake ballots from Fairfax saving him.
1313544489127026696 2020-10-07 02:19:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV @SelimSeesYou Can Trump lose? Yes. But if he does it will be like Virginia Senate 2014 Gillespie against Warner, which was a total polling miss. Only one poll had that race even competitive and it was decided by less than one point. ONE POINT.
1313543035331006464 2020-10-07 02:13:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV @SelimSeesYou It seriously cannot be emphasized enough how trash these polls are. You simply cannot believe them in this environment. They're in full tank mode against Trump and Republican pollsters are being systematically removed despite having good track records.
1313542577602408453 2020-10-07 02:12:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV @SelimSeesYou When these polls show themselves reliable. They have been trash for three cycles. Seriously, they're getting more competitive races wrong than right since 2014. All in favor of Democrats. These internals are trash. This CNN poll has 28% Republican turnout. TRASH.
1313541704977395713 2020-10-07 02:08:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @SelimSeesYou Baris crowdfunds polls and does them based on what his clients (the crowd) wants. He put out a vote basically between Arizona and PA (other options, but they were never in the race) and PA won like 3:1.
1313541295286161408 2020-10-07 02:07:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Str8Don @SelimSeesYou @ShapiroBenjamin It has been non-stop media assault. Honestly, in this environment, it is amazing how much Trump has unified and disciplined a notoriously undisciplined party. So much improvement has been made from where the party was even in 2016 and that was improved from the 2000s.
1313540691155447813 2020-10-07 02:04:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Sorbetti4 @mikea1028 @RedEaglePatriot What I mean by that is the split between ME-1 and ME-2.

1313538590673178624 2020-10-07 01:56:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot But Biden+16 nationally!

Sorry, but at this point, we really have to discount the vast majority of polls, especially at the national level. They can't even possibly reflect reality.
1313534838356480001 2020-10-07 01:41:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> How can miners get job benefits with no mines? What, are we supposed to just pay them to sit on their ass at home? This isn't how civilization works!
1313533239861088258 2020-10-07 01:35:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot They're going to have Americans longing to proclaim Trump Tsar by the night of the election.

Millions of people use it everyday. Yes, it's a piece of the Brooklyn Bridge and if you are kind enough to give me $10,000 cash money, a piece of it can be yours!
1313529708508741633 2020-10-07 01:21:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @KingBroly The only way this will matter is if we're waiting on Arizona and the margin there is less than 50,000, but that would have been the case in a regular election.
1313528916758474752 2020-10-07 01:17:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly @realikamusume I was talking folks like Baris. 18-29s are being overestimated, and their margin for Biden is also being overestimated.
1313528425823514629 2020-10-07 01:15:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly @realikamusume Late, but yes. I do think some of these election forecasters are really overestimating the impact of the mail ins. Most of them will be in by election day.

1313526117521911808 2020-10-07 01:06:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I'm really looking forward to digging deeper into these numbers.

Votes are real live people and those people participate on Twitter and Facebook. You would see huge groups of ex-Trump supporters for Biden if Biden were really looking at a 10+ point national landslide.

The only Democrat since FDR to get those numbers was LBJ running against Goldwater a year after the Kennedy assassination.

Trump has been dealing with this at increasingly fever pitched rates since June 16, 2015. If you’re still falling for it, you really need to re-examine why you’re still their mind prisoner.
1313498498990510082 2020-10-06 23:17:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There was a Biden+13 poll from Illinois like a week or two ago. No way to square that with national polling.
1313498025508196352 2020-10-06 23:15:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dems really confident in their vote rigging machine.

1313492497147011073 2020-10-06 22:53:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I didn't start this Covid thing as an anti-masker conspiracy theorist, but the data is right there. There is no more reason to be afraid. We're subject to yellow journalism on this.
1313491079333908484 2020-10-06 22:47:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @ForecasterEnten The last time Republicans were only 28% of the electorate was 1980.   (BTW, this is why Reagan is so popular among Republicans: He permanently boosted the Republican Party to the mid 30s when they had spent decades in the mid to high 20s).
1313489065778597896 2020-10-06 22:39:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @groyper_boston @ClassicalTheis Just another example of Conquest's Third Law: Anything not explicitly right wing eventually becomes left wing. That show is no exception.
1313486259453603843 2020-10-06 22:28:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @groyper_boston @ClassicalTheis Saagar is getting gayer by the day.
1313483627553083394 2020-10-06 22:17:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There is absolutely no way to square this poll with Biden+3 national polls. No way to square it with Florida being tied. No way to even square it even with Penn+9 for Biden. Half of the polling is pure propaganda this cycle.
1313483138354614277 2020-10-06 22:15:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads They refuse to engage on facts. They always engage on a rhetorical level. "Oh, that's just crazy! You're unpopular!"
1313482725526048768 2020-10-06 22:14:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I love Dems just buying this poll.
1313482248876969988 2020-10-06 22:12:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads The last time an incumbent lost like this was HERBERT HOOVER. Let me repeat: HERBERT HOOVER.
1313478708687261696 2020-10-06 21:58:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @asiandunce @Hakasays But they do it anyway. Because they're dishonest hacks. Pure demagogues. They're really trying to gaslight the American people into believing the government has this magic ability to stop disease in its tracks.
1313477490426470401 2020-10-06 21:53:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TRElections Stop being afraid. The entire reason Trump has succeeded so far is he doesn't give a shit about these traditional rules. He confronts bullshit and the media Covid narrative is total and complete bullshit.
1313477203892621314 2020-10-06 21:52:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @TRElections How do people behave? Revealed preference is people hate lockdowns and think lefties are nuts for insisting on them.   Even where I live, that voted 28% for Trump, you would hardly know Covid was a thing without the mask mandate.
1313474824581382148 2020-10-06 21:42:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @realikamusume Looking at all these results, it does seem that the people returning ballots at the highest rates are old registered Democrats. However, this isn't anything new, they've been doing this as long early voting has been a big deal. It quickly runs out of steam.
1313474292806492163 2020-10-06 21:40:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trutsle @realikamusume Even funnier than the top line here is that the polls showed Trump with like a 20% favorability rating among Republicans when he announced. There were Democrats with better Republican favorables. He turned it around instantaneously upon actually entering the race.
1313473620757315585 2020-10-06 21:38:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mikea1028 @Peoples_Pundit The margin of error on a small subsample like Florida blacks is pretty large. It's reasonable to be off by even ten points.
1313464776023068675 2020-10-06 21:03:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The left had a meltdown last night over a man taking off his mask on his own balcony with no one around.
1313363888369537024 2020-10-06 14:22:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou If you pay close attention to these reports, that’s quite literally what they’re saying. They basically dismiss leftist and minority activists as serious long term threats to the regime.

1313358462185766912 2020-10-06 14:00:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV Wow. They’re really digging deep for the next crisis in Trump’s second term.

1313352991219625984 2020-10-06 13:38:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics More interesting is the 30 somethings that were even more lopsided. Wouldn’t read too much into it now: Young voters are known for procrastination.
1313337806773780480 2020-10-06 12:38:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hakasays @realikamusume Trump needs to win the popular vote to get a mandate and get the House back if possible. Vote even in California.

I've voted Republican straight ticket for literally everything. I voted Ron Paul in the Virginia 2012 primary because he was the only option who wasn't Mitt Romney: I wanted to vote Santorum despite having worked for Paul in 08.

When he went off on that and the illegals, I was literally shocked into supporting him immediately.

1313320027114868770 2020-10-06 11:27:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 Found numbers, Dems won: 2,558,000 to 2,471,000 ( https://t.co/tLCbzGJmmj). Not sure what pace were at "on this day" I do remember GOP making up a lot of ground near the end.
1313319049875591168 2020-10-06 11:23:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @LuisBobby3 Happy to be of service. Don't let the media gaslight you.
1313318785378648064 2020-10-06 11:22:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 Dreaming of a scenario where all these scared Dems who don't want to go to the early vote polls forget to return their ballot. Seems almost likely to me in Florida. Only a tenth of these have returned ballots. It will pick up, but can easily see only 3/4 returning it.
1313317456409235456 2020-10-06 11:17:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks It would appear so. It appears the most anxious group to vote early in Florida are old Democrats. Which isn't the group where these huge Biden margins come from.
1313317008138817536 2020-10-06 11:15:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 Seen some random blackpilling over the Florida return rates and PA lopsided counting. Honestly, these VBM have me excited. If Republicans show up on election day in their usual numbers, they're going to crush it.
1313316270775980032 2020-10-06 11:12:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Florida is always lopsided for Dems in the Early vote and it's still very early in their process. Only a tenth of ballots have actually been returned.
1313315898829279232 2020-10-06 11:11:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Pennsylvania looks like it's heading for the smallest mail in vote of the three rust belt Trump 2016 flips. It's the most lopsided Democrat, but no info on return rate and and it's still only look to be about a third of the total vote.
1313315304081154051 2020-10-06 11:09:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Looked more into these numbers: The numbers that look best for Republicans are the ones that it actually matters. WI and MI are having a huge surge in mail in votes and the GOP is keeping pace.
1313308824674205697 2020-10-06 10:43:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SouthernConsDem Teton County is a gold mine. Who wouldn't have fundraisers there?
1313305543428186113 2020-10-06 10:30:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics I got access to the local voter vault when I was a campaign volunteer at 16. In a state without party registration, but it was still pretty accurate about how left/right someone was and if they had important issues they cared about. It's built on top of the underlying file.
1313303574588329986 2020-10-06 10:22:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Arizona is actually down in ballot requests lmao.
1313303507743715328 2020-10-06 10:22:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_Rep00_ Yeah, this is going to be close, but these VBM numbers are actually better than I was expecting except in PA, which are about what people were expecting.
1313302420554997761 2020-10-06 10:17:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I can't believe there are people blackpilling about these vote by mail numbers. After all that campaigning, Dems only got like 14.5 million registered/inferred Dems in the whole country to request them.
1313298118159609856 2020-10-06 10:00:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical They hate him. They hate his voters. They hate everything he stands for, or they think he stands for. It's just beyond reason.
1313297847840890883 2020-10-06 09:59:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DayPolitical I've seen so many people lose all perspective over Trump. They say Trump is a hater or whatever, but so many people are consumed by hatred of a man they don't even know.
1313297406105194497 2020-10-06 09:57:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAPolitics The same people that want you to believe the first smidgen of returns from Florida want you to ignore the returns from Nevada, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Got it.
1313297076156018690 2020-10-06 09:56:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> How can you be this insulated from the truth? Seriously, this is just mind boggling levels of delusion and hatred. They refuse to believe a man in a category with an, at minimum, 98% survival rate survived? Like, this isn't hard.  https://t.co/5KFZmNkUfK
1313295850014158848 2020-10-06 09:51:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation These people claim Trump is a demagogue (perhaps he is), but is there anymore raw demagoguery than engendering class envy over the POTUS getting better living conditions than the rest of us?

1313294715891130370 2020-10-06 09:47:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @realikamusume @Rufus38605416 @VirginiaConser8 Yeah, that's why you usually see this huge dump of heavily Democrat ballots that usually narrow in Florida, Nevada, and Ohio. Arizona tends to count them more over time, so it tends to turn against Republicans.
1313293948031508486 2020-10-06 09:44:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @realikamusume @Rufus38605416 @VirginiaConser8 All the ones that have large early vote usually do it ahead of time, but there's a lot of BS court rulings going on that haven't been settled yet.
1313293721966964737 2020-10-06 09:43:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These are incredibly broken people and they wonder why conservatives refuse to trust them about anything. This whole trend is a bunch of people who believe obvious bunk from a 15 year old girl. These people cannot be let run a country.

1313289917804535809 2020-10-06 09:28:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @NateSilver538 In the Nate Silver model, even charitably, anything less than 90% likelihood is essentially meaningless to real world results because we will never go through enough elections for the model to be proven. It can always account for upsets.

1313285465223692289 2020-10-06 09:10:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Because Trump is his own actor and they can't have that. He's not /ourguy/, but that doesn't make him /theirguy/ and they can't have that.
1313285251859451905 2020-10-06 09:09:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I keep tweeting stuff ending with lmao tonight. It's because I've actually been laughing my ass off all night. Really high energy over here.

Honestly, all of this is too early to make any solid conclusions, but there is just zero evidence of this overwhelming groundswell of Democrat ballots the polls are predicting. Even in Florida.
1313284271600291840 2020-10-06 09:05:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> All Dems have today is like a 2% higher ballot return rate in Florida that could change at any time. Lmao.

Trump was the first effective advocate they have had in a Presidential Primary since Pat Buchanan and he was challenging an incumbent. Even Reagan tapped into nationalistic fervor.

Traditionally, societies solve these problems through enforcement of social relationships, but that is the ultimate taboo in our libertine society.
1313238989055369231 2020-10-06 06:05:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @00lshr @Nomos_Forever @Odious_Ledger @BeigeShiba The biggest enemy right now is the anti-competitive contracts our governments allow. They enforce monopsonies for Amazon, Wal Mart, etc. These are anti-competitive and are designed at accumulating wealth and power unjustly in the big box distributors and the big tech firms.
1313238448216694790 2020-10-06 06:03:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @00lshr @Nomos_Forever @Odious_Ledger @BeigeShiba You simply cannot do this arbitrarily. It feels good because our enemies presently accumulate wealth, but it isn't a just point of view and is expressly immoral in the pages of Scripture. Rather, we must create just laws that hamper the designs of the truly greedy.
1313225411816501249 2020-10-06 05:11:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @parkercassidy4 If the GOP can win back the House by some miracle, something like the RAISE Act can be passed now and a more favorable illegal immigration settlement.
1313225130433273864 2020-10-06 05:10:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @parkercassidy4 They were on record for the most part and 2/3 were forced out of the party, 1 has passed, the other two are far more reliable votes today than before. The Senate GOP is a far more disciplined group under Trump: It's quite amazing given the struggles historically in that body.
1313223205511933956 2020-10-06 05:03:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @parkercassidy4 How are you going to get 51 Senate votes to overturn the filibuster in the Senate with McCain, Flake, Murkowski, Collins, and Corker all still there?
1313222708876980231 2020-10-06 05:01:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 @parkercassidy4 The legal questions there are much more debatable. The Administration has to pass two hurdles I'm not sure the Roberts Court would have affirmed in 2017-18:   1. The 14th Amendment doesn't guarantee it. 2. The President has the authority to issue an EO on it.
1313218014268055554 2020-10-06 04:42:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 Personally, remembering the 2006 amnesty battle and then then the Rubio push in 2013, this is all very good news. We nearly had total amnesty both of those times, citizenship for tens of millions. Conversation is totally different under Trump.
1313217374666002432 2020-10-06 04:39:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 He has not indicated any willingness to just hand DACA kids citizenship without significant concessions (the last bill, they had to wait at least 20 years even to be citizens and that still wasn't good enough). People are sympathetic to DACA kids: He has to express sympathy.
1313216923275087874 2020-10-06 04:38:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon Bill Clinton 1992 was himself a moderate, almost Conservative, Democrat. Democrats turned to him because of how much of a disaster northeast liberalism proved to them electorally and, indeed, it is still a loser for them. That's why Obama oversaw historic Dem losses downballot.
1313215811423789059 2020-10-06 04:33:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 Trump had an incredibly small amount of political capital when he was elected. Possibly the least in the modern era. He has had to fight merely to maintain his office. Something like the RAISE Act was simply never possible.
1313215489892593665 2020-10-06 04:32:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @parkercassidy4 He has not. He has never had the political capital to actually get anything major done on that front and people on the outside saying he has, like Ann Coulter, have proven themselves time and again of being completely ignorant of how political capital actually works.
1313214142703177731 2020-10-06 04:27:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> He is not a rejection of the Tea Party movement or religious conservatives. He is an AFFIRMATION of all of these things and an insistence on fighting for them tooth and nail and always has been. 3/3
1313214090437955589 2020-10-06 04:26:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> He did not represent a departure from historic Republican norms. Virtually nothing on his platform is outside the norms of the historic Republican Party.  He is not a rejection of the market or moderate fiscal restraint. 2/3
1313214047173701637 2020-10-06 04:26:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think some of you have really misjudged the nature of the Trump phenomenon. Trump did not run on national populism. He was a trade and immigration hawk with a personality GOP voters felt could get the job done. 1/3  https://t.co/aoYKN70sz6
1313209327159828494 2020-10-06 04:07:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume You know, if Biden had been elected in 2008, it wouldn't have been so bad. This shit is hilarious.
1313208019744960522 2020-10-06 04:02:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly I feel like if you ask the right questions, rapid marriages seem to be the happiest ones. That said, a lot of people don't know the right questions and basing this purely off feelz. Sometimes people just click in a good way, though, and you shouldn't unduly frustrate that.
1313206020932501504 2020-10-06 03:54:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IcedGroyper @KingFrenly Practically speaking, it can, in some circumstances, be difficult to ascertain if you are truly compatible in 12 months these days. However, it's not THAT hard. Most people who think adding five years to a courtship would change the outcome don't even know what questions to ask.
1313205338318008321 2020-10-06 03:52:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads To be fair, with Black men running around, can you blame them?  The never ending cycle of matriarchal violence.

No matter what happens, he can say his model accounts for it without really digging into the details as to why. A 70-30 split may as well be 50-50 in the real world.
1313204183332421633 2020-10-06 03:47:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly Seriously, if it feels right, her parents approve, and she's willing to say "love, honor, and obey," then what is there to drawing out the inevitable?
1313203795250339846 2020-10-06 03:45:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly Based and whirlwind romance-pilled.
1313202374828322817 2020-10-06 03:40:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon Dems had a chance to make Covid a real disaster and they've tried their darnedest, but if that really succeeded, then I think you'd see a lot more base faltering than we've seen throughout this cycle. At every turn, the base circles their wagons around Trump.
1313200421050232832 2020-10-06 03:32:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Beams78 Perot's support probably would have split about equally. Even then, Bush would have had a lot more base problems than Trump does.
1313199227321937926 2020-10-06 03:27:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The last incumbent to lose reelection was George HW Bush. That year, he only received 74% of the vote from his own party. Trump still has his base. He's even running better among Republicans than Ford.
1313197563714179078 2020-10-06 03:21:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Nearly 30% of Democrats voted for Reagan that year. Different dynamics back then, but there's zero sign of Republicans faltering in their Trump support. Not even in the fake news polls.
1313197271316660225 2020-10-06 03:20:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Yeah, it's ridiculous. I'm supposed to expect to believe there's this historic landslide incoming the likes of which we haven't seen since Carter lost the 80 election and there's just zero sign of it. Like, people were excited about Reagan. Biden? Give me a break.
1313196532993331202 2020-10-06 03:17:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Democrats are going to have to rely on Independents breaking against Trump by a record margin.
1313194841384325121 2020-10-06 03:10:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @LuisBobby3 @AirBossUT @realikamusume @TRElections @eball0911 @RealAPolitics That seems EXTREMELY unlikely, but it is, at least, in the realm of human possibility.
1313194696248881161 2020-10-06 03:09:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @LuisBobby3 @AirBossUT @realikamusume @TRElections @eball0911 @RealAPolitics I could see 2008 participation levels, maybe even a little bit higher. However, even in a terrible year for Trump, some of that increase will come from his supporters (see 2018 where the GOP also got record turnout). That would be about 156 million voters or so, 70 for Trump.
1313193467204579328 2020-10-06 03:04:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @billsretpal These things have a way of balancing out in the long run. Imagine how hopeless it looked for Republicans in 1936. The major parties will always find a way to rebound from even the worst disasters. What emerges after is anyone's guess.
1313192458331750402 2020-10-06 03:00:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @LuisBobby3 @AirBossUT @realikamusume @TRElections @eball0911 @RealAPolitics For instance, even to get to even the same percentage boost as 2014 (a historically low midterm) to 2018, you'd need more than 70% eligible voter participation. Last time we had that? 1900, yes 1900. Not even Herbert Hoover was that hated. HERBERT HOOVER.
1313191370216157186 2020-10-06 02:56:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @LuisBobby3 @AirBossUT @realikamusume @TRElections @eball0911 @RealAPolitics The problem is the law of diminishing returns. Eventually you just run out of voters.

You'd have to see something truly crazy to get 30% new voters in an electorate, though. Notably in 1972, polls highly overestimated youth McGovern support.
1313188330729803779 2020-10-06 02:44:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> LMAO: It's already trending. Didn't even see it.

This would be more than 50% more than that. It's physically impossible to replicate across the country, I don't think. Certainly not indicated in VBM trends.

1313184313270247424 2020-10-06 02:28:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat Buchanan told a group of students he wanted to take their Pell grants away. He wasn't some natpop looking to redistribute wealth. He ran as the true heir of Reagan.
1313183610191699969 2020-10-06 02:25:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat Ron Paul was in many ways a Trump forerunner. He made it mainstream to be antiwar in the party again. Indeed, by 2016 Trump bashed Bush on stage and it was a WINNING issue in the GOP primary. They have plenty of differences, but they definitely draw from similar voting bases.
1313182526891012099 2020-10-06 02:21:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat His only noise on the populist front was on trade. Otherwise, he ran a very traditional Republican campaign. However, the Tea Party was also opposed to TPP and wanted NAFTA reform. This is a common GOP position going way back.
1313182258006831110 2020-10-06 02:20:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat People like Saagar have completely misread the Trump and Tea Party phenomenons. They are, fundamentally, one and the same. The Tea Party base were never free market ideologues and Trump never ran on this pseudo-left wing populist platform.
1313179578089852928 2020-10-06 02:09:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @conn_paleo I meant to put Rhode Island in the lean category with Delaware. I think a lot more resources would be dedicated to flipping Illinois when it trends competitive again.
1313179044297478146 2020-10-06 02:07:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheBigProp Illinois is already trending back to being competitive. If Trump gets above 40, then I think it will trend with the rest of the Midwest.
1313177871784046594 2020-10-06 02:02:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Texas is the big battleground. Rust belt is still trending Republican. Other paths to victory besides Texas would be to win Oregon or North Carolina.
1313177393541066757 2020-10-06 02:01:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think this could be what a narrow Republican victory looks like in 2032 or 2036 if Trump wins a second term.  https://t.co/wVh6totom4
1313174407087521795 2020-10-06 01:49:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep I was confused: Thought they voted for Cert. That was my impression as well: The case really isn't a Supreme Court matter, but I honestly feel for Kim Davis. Their decision here wouldn't really create any precedent.
1313173910310055936 2020-10-06 01:47:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Some people read Oswald Spengler and take his BS way too seriously.
1313172040174764038 2020-10-06 01:39:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep It should be clarified that just because Gorsuch, Roberts, and Kavanaugh voted to deny cert doesn't mean they're onboard with the decision in the first place.
1313170262213394432 2020-10-06 01:32:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @flagg_colonel @realikamusume The only thing believable about the poll is that Trump is running two points ahead of McSally, which is where I've pegged the race the whole damn time.
1313159583058276359 2020-10-06 00:50:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @VeriteJacques You can grant a pardon for every crime previously committed. That's how Ford pardoned Nixon.
1313159316199870466 2020-10-06 00:49:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads It's all the more reason Trump has to win. These people need to be absolutely humiliated until their reputation is so shot only true cultists follow their deranged rants.
1313158480824500224 2020-10-06 00:45:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads You'd think they'd at least hedge their bets a little.
1313157578780741633 2020-10-06 00:42:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon They can try, but the pardon power is absolute.
1313156808484282369 2020-10-06 00:39:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If Trump loses (may it never be), I'm thinking it would be a good idea for him to resign and have Pence grant him a complete pardon before we get the inevitable revenge show trial.
1313151270144872451 2020-10-06 00:17:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trixareforlibs @RedEaglePatriot If Trump wins, it will solidify his already incredibly strong hold on the party. 2024 will be Pence vs. a candidate claiming to be the true heir of Trump.

Those minority populations turned their energies to undermining the state. There probably wasn't anything wrong with their policies towards Austrian Germans and Hungarians.

They fall behind in technology, lose wars, or become victim of internal strife because they do not let their people prosper.
1313143662239506432 2020-10-05 23:47:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Odious_Ledger @BeigeShiba @00lshr There was one old school right wing regime that was effective in dealing with technology: Pre-Great War Germany. It had the right balance of letting creative enterprise develop while controlling the key systems of information.
1313141983377076228 2020-10-05 23:40:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The narrative pre-Trump diagnosis was that he was well aware of the threat of the virus and cynically protecting himself while doing nothing for the country. Now he's an incompetent fool for "letting" his admin get infected.   Some of you are fools enough to buy both of them.

Only way Canada lasts long is if they fortify their natural barriers and then launch attacks with the aid of the rest of the Commonwealth (this was the British war plan in case of war with the US pre-WWII)

1313136573102395392 2020-10-05 23:18:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III All this straight hair is symbolic of our needing everything to look all nice and clean on the outside because on the inside our souls are dark and twisted.   Same thing with our near religious commitment to minimalist decorating standards.
1313131927306723330 2020-10-05 23:00:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep Same garbage has happened with abortion. So many states have tried to pass laws to make Catholic hospitals support it in some way, it's ridiculous.
1313130289309331458 2020-10-05 22:53:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep What is the case?
1313129427891564544 2020-10-05 22:50:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> A really good example of this is Prop 8: All the polls showed it would fail, but then it succeeded by a five point margin. People in California might have said they supported gay marriage, but they simply weren't ready to cast a ballot for it when all was set and done.
1313128878693588992 2020-10-05 22:48:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BatteryFive Yeah, scientific surveys are difficult on things that aren't, fundamentally, a scientific project and involve expressions of volitional human will.
1313128535050129408 2020-10-05 22:46:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There have been a number of races over the years the polls have all shown going one way that makes no sense, then on the eve of the election everything just changes. I'm not convinced this is conspiratorial. Sometimes it's just a false preference.
1313128120522878976 2020-10-05 22:45:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I honestly think there is something about voting the polls don’t actually capture. The fundamentals play a big role when someone actually casts a vote. Tons of examples well beyond the Presidential level where fundamentals just take hold of a race when voting arrives.
1313127884664569858 2020-10-05 22:44:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There is literally no way you can square this with Biden+14 results.

1312972093718437894 2020-10-05 12:25:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba @00lshr Coming up with the right balance here has proven incredibly difficult for right wing regimes.
1312971712208797696 2020-10-05 12:23:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @00lshr @BeigeShiba Now imagine a country without computers facing off against even a nation half its size with computers. Computer country crushes the primitives.
1312971482323185664 2020-10-05 12:22:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @00lshr @BeigeShiba This is the problem with a lot of reactionary thinking and why it lost favor so quickly in light of the First World War. It’s just impossible to compete as an agrarian, reactionary society against mass industrial mobilization. The tech always wins.
1312969740806168576 2020-10-05 12:15:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ferric242 @CottoGottfried 1992 had more wild swings, but that was because of Perot. After he left the race really stabilized until he came back and it was still pretty stable.
1312969560178544641 2020-10-05 12:15:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ferric242 @CottoGottfried You have to reach back all the way to 1988, which had the most legendary unforced error of all time combined with the most effective negative ad ever.
1312967805806010370 2020-10-05 12:08:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ferric242 @CottoGottfried Is 2016 the first race we had new facts in? It’s the first time we saw such wild shifts in polling.
1312967135161921538 2020-10-05 12:05:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Ferric242 @CottoGottfried Garbage. There was never a point in time when Trump was losing by 10. There were polls that had Trump tied in Missouri: A state he won by 20 points. It was never a tie.

1312915970336468992 2020-10-05 08:42:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou OK: I actually do believe this is a House play. El Paso and San Antonio are the media markets for the 23rd CD, which is a key target for House Dems. Wendy Davis is challenging Chip Roy in TX-21 near San Antonio as well and she's a leftie darling despite her defeats.
1312913806121730048 2020-10-05 08:33:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou El Paso and San Antonio are heavily Hispanic (like 90% in El Paso).   Overall, I don't like the move, but given the targeted nature, he might just be trying to shore up a base for congressional elections.

People have been afraid Georgia is trending blue for decades because of Northerners moving to the Atlanta suburbs. They only started turning when other suburbanites nationally did as well.

1312902795792711682 2020-10-05 07:49:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Seriously, what is the difference between believing Putin is an agent of the old KGB power structures trying to restore the USSR and believing that Trump is opposed by forces in the permanent government?
1312902497388949504 2020-10-05 07:48:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp These people call you a "conspiracy theorist" for applying age old political theories. The idea of some permanent government behind democratic forms would have been familiar to Ancient Greek philosophers. The media promotes the idea of a "deep state" in the former USSR itself.
1312901720448606208 2020-10-05 07:45:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Deep State is literally just a descriptor for the legions of bureaucrats and operatives that work for the government. It isn't the idea there's some guy who's the secret President in some dark bunker command center somewhere.

1312876111152414721 2020-10-05 06:03:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sovereignminds_ @RealAPolitics A lot of Obama voters didn't vote down ballot for Democrats, so the margin for Democrats was much narrower than for Obama. Trump voters could theoretically do the same, but evidence is they're mostly reliable GOP voters.

Then we got this horrendous Biden landslide poll from NBC/WSJ that everyone knows is BS and everyone’s panicking. How many Clinton+12 polls did we get last time?
1312822177444564992 2020-10-05 02:29:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ellen6019 @RedEaglePatriot About the only difference is that it has shifted a point or two towards Biden compared to Hillary.

1312800369181949959 2020-10-05 01:02:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed The last Democrat to win by that margin or more was Lyndon Johnson facing Barry Goldwater.

1312410596701286400 2020-10-03 23:14:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JackPosobiec Joe Biden claimed to be in the Senate for 180 years. He would have voted. We should ask him. His state was, after all, a slave state.
1312409595227365378 2020-10-03 23:10:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @oldcarolinian Lancelot Andrews affirmed the reformation doctrine.
1312409150970830848 2020-10-03 23:08:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pseudophilo “Donald Drumpf is conman. Drumpf liar. Drumpf didn’t drain the swamp. Drumpf racist. Drumpf fascist.”
1312408573918490626 2020-10-03 23:06:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @oldcarolinian Why do you think so?
1312408502627901440 2020-10-03 23:05:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd I’m so done with this. Enemy of the people.
1312408212675743745 2020-10-03 23:04:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @oldcarolinian The only question you have to ask about the Reformation is: Were the Reformers right about their doctrine of sola scriptura? Everything else is the consequences of history.
1312262851650871296 2020-10-03 13:26:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW I like sake, but you clearly aren’t drinking tawny port.
1312262337894780933 2020-10-03 13:24:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat A conversation between dumb and dumber. Which is which? Answer: Only dumbest cares.
1312260148652634113 2020-10-03 13:16:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @realikamusume 362 EVs is every state or EV that has been contested by Republicans since 2000. It would include some hard lifts, but none totally off the wall.
1312259772524228615 2020-10-03 13:14:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @realikamusume He still had it at 362. That’s far more plausible because it doesn’t involve insane states.
1312257760352964608 2020-10-03 13:06:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume 20%? I mean, he’d have to win one of: NY, IL, CA, or MD. Just seems impossible.
1312256319143976960 2020-10-03 13:01:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @ByzCat I think there was a while where we thought it would happen faster, then that it would be slow after it didn’t happen. However, reading history, it becomes clear these events happen very slowly and then, one day, a dam just breaks.
1312255253140602881 2020-10-03 12:56:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @softsuthernwind Honestly, the media’s violent response to it is the strongest evidence in its favor as far as I’m concerned.
1312254128844873728 2020-10-03 12:52:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IVMiles I think something like half of people admit to cheating at some point. Not clear it’s that high of an overrepresentation.
1312244388555304961 2020-10-03 12:13:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @softsuthernwind I'd remove any of Kansas and significant chunks of Florida. I'm not terribly sure about including any of IL, IN, or OH either.
1312233921111875584 2020-10-03 11:32:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReactionaryIan While bombastic, Trump really didn't take any revolutionary positions within the party. Even the protectionist stuff had a base in the GOP pre-Trump and that was his most far out there thing.
1312233519981170688 2020-10-03 11:30:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReactionaryIan I've been a bit confused by him.   Larger note, I think a lot of people (including Trump's biggest supporters) have totally misread the Trump phenomenon themselves. There's no hunger for a radical shift in pre-Trump base GOP politics, just that they're better represented.

1312159588821524480 2020-10-03 06:36:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @InternetZenMstr @realikamusume Biden leaders too.
1312150180083331072 2020-10-03 05:59:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Checking out for tonight. If Trump gets really sick, so be it.
1312150048910635008 2020-10-03 05:58:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> None of you people know anything. Stop your wild speculations.
1312122224397094912 2020-10-03 04:08:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot It's simply impossible to reconcile these polls. It's even worse when you look at how they're getting the top line numbers. The recent huge margins for Biden are because of Indies. But these close polls show Trump close or winning Indies. Not a margin of error deal.
1312120340814819328 2020-10-03 04:00:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @realikamusume This is exactly what happened in Virginia. It’s exacerbated here by the demos of the college educated White vote here. There are paths to fixing this, but action needs to be taken.
1312119697484079105 2020-10-03 03:58:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Drumpf is finished. We finally got him.
1312118402828230656 2020-10-03 03:52:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @realikamusume Not in NM, but I imagine same thing there.
1312118258393178112 2020-10-03 03:52:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @realikamusume White working class is really getting screwed by immigration in states with a lot of educated jobs (NM has a lot of government jobs from the labs, mil, etc.). I just saw a working crew yesterday where not a single one of the dozens of workers were White.
1312116658450821120 2020-10-03 03:46:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @bestgtor88 If there's a 12 point swing among Hispanics towards Trump, that itself halves his margin in the state. Just needs to suck up enough of the White Johnson vote and he's over the top in the state. NM has a malleable electorate.
1312115708478668800 2020-10-03 03:42:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @realikamusume As a percentage of the voting population, Hispanics are actually more influential in New Mexico than California. It is vaguely possible Trump gets Bush levels of Hispanic support while losing a small share of the WWC vote and that would lead to that crazy map.
1312114827377086466 2020-10-03 03:38:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I came up with this map. Odds are extremely low, but it does seem *possible*.  https://t.co/SJICVzpdAV
1312113769103859714 2020-10-03 03:34:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume If Hispanics have really flipped as much as a lot of people think, the state is certain to be a lot closer. Could make for a weird path to victory in some odd instances.
1312113047838756865 2020-10-03 03:31:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried In the swing states, Evangelicals are at or above national average. They're just really underrepresented in New England, New York, and the West Coast.
1312112727804928001 2020-10-03 03:30:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried No. Unless you think Iowa is a solid GOP state from exactly one election. Or Ohio. Or Michigan. Or Penn. Or Wisconsin. Or Texas. All these states have large Evangelical pops. Evangelicals are still over a quarter of the adult pop in this country and actually growing.
1312112205265993729 2020-10-03 03:28:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LoneAdvMGL @CottoGottfried OH, PA, WI, and MI all have significant religious right voting blocs. Heck, Grand Rapids is a veritable HQ of Evangelical activity. Just look at nearly any Evangelical book published in this country and it will be stamped "Grand Rapids, Michigan."
1312111849639346176 2020-10-03 03:26:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @FreeNortherner Want to get the "I actually read banned books treatment" at B&amp;N, just slip to the Bible section and peruse conservative looking KJVs.
1312109767041507330 2020-10-03 03:18:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Trump wins these because when he lands a punch it LANDS and people don't punch back at him effectively. It looks messy, but it's effective at actually winning over voters and that's all that matters. If he had the style too, he'd be OP. Devs had to balance his character.
1312109189238419456 2020-10-03 03:16:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Three day weekend next week. Thinking of going somewhere. Just somewhere.

1312103136492806144 2020-10-03 02:52:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DirkRecker7676 @CottoGottfried *50% of the Trump vote
1312103060546617344 2020-10-03 02:52:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DirkRecker7676 @CottoGottfried Evangelicals alone were 26% of the vote in 2016. Trump got 81% of them. That's ~21% of the vote were Trump Evangelicals. Even if you assume a mere 10% of the Catholic vote also counts as "religious" right you're at more than 10% of the Trump vote.
1312101467579273217 2020-10-03 02:45:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nsquaredcrypto @GunsOfIllyria @PollWatch2020 That was an incredibly close election that Ford started with an unprecedented handicap on. Really respectable showing given the situation.
1312100559713828864 2020-10-03 02:42:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner Formal institutions are always preferable to shadow ones, even if, in theory, the shadow would be better when made formal. The key to stability is people knowing the rules.
1312097670983487489 2020-10-03 02:30:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SouthernConsDem I mean, c'mon, Strom Thurmond was a Republican most of his time in the Senate. Also, I really don't get the whole Biden attack line on busing. Busing was a horrible policy and literally no one liked it besides some wacko judges.
1312096908698157057 2020-10-03 02:27:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I don't know what it is about ordinary Republicans, but they just absolutely hate the religious right. Born Again Evangelicals were 26% of the vote in 2016 and 81% of them voted GOP. What kind of moron would abandon 30 million (at least) reliable voters?
1312096479574732800 2020-10-03 02:25:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried More than half of Trump's vote in 2016 can be classified as the "Religious Right." Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face. Abandoning your base is never a good idea.

1312080361271316480 2020-10-03 01:21:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> You want to stop a SCOTUS confirmation over the rona? Get bent.
1312079239718543363 2020-10-03 01:17:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 It's a joke. I mean, no one working age is vulnerable unless they qualify for disability. I understand some of us have people at home, but we're really talking about over a year of disruption on this call.
1312077945419247616 2020-10-03 01:12:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> In a meeting: How are we all still supposed to pretend to be scared of Covid? Like, is this real? I'm convinced it's mostly an excuse not to do work at this point.
1312075889291784192 2020-10-03 01:04:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Gonna have to walk to Scotland unfortunately. No more gas.
1312073023302914049 2020-10-03 00:52:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Unless there's just a flood of NeverTrumpers signing up to vote in rural rust belt counties, all of these places just appear to be more fundamentally Republican than they were 4 years ago.
1312071822700142597 2020-10-03 00:47:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation A lot of Indies also believe in "divided government." I mean, my family have been partisan Republicans for a LONG time and even they sometimes thought along these types of lines.
1312069640999313411 2020-10-03 00:39:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation California voted for Kerry by less than 10 points (barely less, but still less) in 2004.   It's crazy how many Rep Senators there were from blue states before 2006. Of course, this shift has led to the Senate being a far more partisan body than it was then.
1312065452563206151 2020-10-03 00:22:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @CottoGottfried A lot of these people just don't have any idea what it takes to govern. You can't just insist on your ideological proclivities every moment when you're President.
1312054697239498752 2020-10-02 23:39:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IVMiles Us California kids have even less hope in the cold weather. Hits 50 degrees and we're like "time for the parka."
1312053457021534208 2020-10-02 23:34:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Oh, no, I'm scared. Biden will continue to show up to train stations and attract dozens of supporters.
1312052616231297025 2020-10-02 23:31:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReactionaryIan These people are really just throwing stuff out there hoping it sticks. None of the criticism is genuine. If you think Biden would have handled it any better overall, I have ocean front property in Arizona I'd like to sell you.
1312051085775962112 2020-10-02 23:25:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReactionaryIan I said this a week or two ago. The most substantive critique I can find is that he didn't ramp up production of PPE and masks fast enough or something. When stated this way, it's really hard to come to the conclusion he is a "murderer," though.
1312047810305560587 2020-10-02 23:12:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TonesHyus @TedBrogan92485 @JohnDoe22628416 @realikamusume @TRElections They only listen to top lines of polls and don’t investigate further. An almost criminal lack of curiosity evidenced.
1312042134330126337 2020-10-02 22:49:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation We're all wondering if it helps or hurts the campaign on a cynical level. You're right: It really depends on the course of the illness. If he recovers quickly, the upside is potentially tremendous on a lot of levels. If it drags on, the downside is also potentially large.
1312040984025460736 2020-10-02 22:45:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I have never bought any of the rhetoric against Trump because I have felt *personally* accused of this type of stuff over the years. They won't have a conversation about genuine right-wing ideas. They just try to get you to back down based on a label. At some point, just say no.
1312040197874429952 2020-10-02 22:42:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Just a reminder that the left is really just angry Trump punches back at these sorts of things. I hate playing the "you started it" game, but at some point when you keep escalating this rhetoric you have to expect an in kind response.
1312034464453795840 2020-10-02 22:19:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Normal human response if you oppose the President: "It's difficult for me to have sympathy for the President because I feel he has really let America down with his Covid response."  TDS Response: "I hope you die! You're literally Hitler! you should have stopped all disease!"
1312029031521550337 2020-10-02 21:57:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed A bunch of people are posting this bizarre message with different images (all of a disturbing nature) on the President's Tweet about his Covid diagnosis:  https://t.co/Ef8dPnhrb6
1312026811988148228 2020-10-02 21:49:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jamesdkclark These people actually believe all their own BS. It's really crazy.
1312026336052031488 2020-10-02 21:47:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Maybe at least refrain from posting replies with demonic images and curses in bizarre foreign scripts.
1312025304194592768 2020-10-02 21:43:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TiddieChvmper2 Between Covid and the Melania tapes, really looking good for the President.
1312024859430584325 2020-10-02 21:41:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They really can't help themselves and I love it.
1311910588919017472 2020-10-02 14:07:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Yes, because someone is President they should be *checks notes* immune to all disease.
1311906416274350080 2020-10-02 13:50:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @mtracey It’s almost like these libs haven’t been listening to us at all.
1311901223835009025 2020-10-02 13:30:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ramzpaul No. Because that will mean Trump clearly faked his positive test. No other reading in psycho conspiracy driven leftie media.
1311897801685598210 2020-10-02 13:16:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jondutoit He’s asymptomatic so far. He could remain so.
1311897027622694914 2020-10-02 13:13:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The two arguments Dems have are the “decency” argument that Trump just isn’t a decent guy and turning to Biden is turning to decency. The other is Covid. Literally watching both of those go up in flames.
1311895706014306304 2020-10-02 13:08:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Simplicissimu16 That’s the only possible negative, but odds are more likely a delay.
1311895269177544704 2020-10-02 13:06:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW He contracted it on purpose!
1311894898866614273 2020-10-02 13:04:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump will be fine. On the off chance he dies of Covid, well, 2020. I like everyone still acting like it’s a death sentence when even among olds there’s over 95% survival now.
1311892736686075906 2020-10-02 12:56:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Emperor_of_PA @Cole45458208 @davidchapman141 I mean, Clinton sailed to reelection in 1996 and was only at 86%.
1311892635209076736 2020-10-02 12:55:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Emperor_of_PA @Cole45458208 @davidchapman141 There was a cult of personality from the beginning, but in 2012 there were still a lot more legacy Dems and legacy Dems were always less reliable than legacy Republicans.
1311883796321628160 2020-10-02 12:20:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks We’re so divided on the issues it’s impossible to win on those. Gotta win by mud slinging.
1311882287974359042 2020-10-02 12:14:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried @NoctRomaRTW The polls shifted from huge D over samples to now they’re getting their number from HUGE Biden margins among Indies. Some of these national polls show 20+ point Biden Indie wins. Just totally unrealistic. A D+5 electorate is at least vaguely possible.
1311881045655068677 2020-10-02 12:09:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacksonPackson1 @RedEaglePatriot I’d imagine by “calling it” he means with certainty. Without even a chance at NC, difficult to see Dems taking the Senate. Would have to take Iowa (in addition to AZ, ME, and CO) and only lose Alabama.

1311872679608188928 2020-10-02 11:36:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba He set a bad precedent by limiting himself to two terms. Either should have kept going or made it clear he didn’t want another for personal reasons.
1311870178104422400 2020-10-02 11:26:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 And, obviously, these people all had their own corners where they were influential even before that. The thing that set TRS apart was its initial willingness to be a meeting ground for all these different factions of hard dissident right and the insistence to never "punch right."
1311869849140854785 2020-10-02 11:25:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 A lot of the stuff goes back a while. The Alt-Right developed from NRx, which itself developed from the hardline National Conservatism of people like Larry Auster, Pat Buchanan, Sam Francis. There has been an Internet subculture around these people since the days of Usenet.
1311868682600054787 2020-10-02 11:20:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @realikamusume The answer you are looking for is yes.
1311866456481697798 2020-10-02 11:11:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 Both. The answer you're look for is that he is both. The whole team over there at TRS really took a very positive development and spun it into a bunch of crazy wignats.
1311864847370457097 2020-10-02 11:05:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 Charlottesville was a freaking psyop. Also, note, there's a large faction that thinks it's "neither good nor bad." Especially among Republicans, I think a lot of that is social desirability bias.

That's what the Tea Party tried to be. They always were a populist movement: They want a government that stands for the little guy while also not getting in his way.
1311859221768605699 2020-10-02 10:43:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_Rep00_ They're desperate. They know these polls are fake.
1311858808663179264 2020-10-02 10:41:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This Melania leak, while hilarious, is also a new low. What was done to her just now is ILLEGAL in several states. You can go to jail. Imagine having a confidante and having your personal conversations leaked to the media. With the Internet, we need more two party consent states.

It will partially depend on the primary dynamic, which will probably be Pence vs. someone claiming to be more Trumpist than Pence.

1311815761384615937 2020-10-02 07:50:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DeathtoTyrants4 @NoctRomaRTW Friend, we seem to have gotten off on the wrong foot. I simply made a single factual observation.
1311815240305332225 2020-10-02 07:48:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DeathtoTyrants4 @LueYee The last time Minnesota voted for a losing Republican was 1916. Does that mean it will ever be thus? No: It voted to the right of the country in the past two cycles (2016, 2018) by most metrics.
1311815052731666432 2020-10-02 07:47:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DeathtoTyrants4 @LueYee The fact that Republicans have added raw voters to their rolls in the state for the first time since 2004 indicates that the massive demographic shifts the state has experienced over the past 20 years are slowing and could start turning in the other direction.
1311814226726522880 2020-10-02 07:44:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation It's October, stop blackpilling. This is a Dem poll and the final RCP average in 2016 had it at Trump+3.
1311813591549571078 2020-10-02 07:41:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DeathtoTyrants4 @LueYee I'm interested in long term trends, not your ideological proclivities.
1311813371088588801 2020-10-02 07:40:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW One reason the popular vote is so stacked against Republicans is just how much turnout Democrats can juice in California (and New York). They could easily win the state by 5 million votes this go around while the rest of the country votes Republican.
1311812959581220864 2020-10-02 07:39:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW Yes. It's difficult to see a Republican doing any worse than Trump did in 2016 at 31.6%/4.4 million votes. I think Trump will beat his raw vote total from 2016, but the percentage might slip as Democrats have registered 1.6 million people since 2016.
1311811322108170241 2020-10-02 07:32:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think 2016 or 2020 will be the worst Presidential year ever for Republicans in the State of California. The raw number of Republicans increased in the state for the first time since 2004. Might have finally reached an equilibrium of sorts.
1311806965941784579 2020-10-02 07:15:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PatriarchPrimus They really do believe this. They believe the mother has the right to determine the personhood of the child.
1311794306252976128 2020-10-02 06:25:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation I see things swinging back and I just see Arizona as kind of the tipping point. McSally has been a reliable vote (so have Gardner and Tillis), and given I think it will be the closest, seems like the best bang for the buck. Still probably won’t give anything.
1311793703640543238 2020-10-02 06:22:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Related: I don’t know what it is where even in conservative Christian circles some are arguing that “brethren” isn’t an inclusive enough term for women. Like, no woman is not going to Church because they say the word “brethren” instead of whatever gender-inclusive word.
1311791366020698112 2020-10-02 06:13:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GrayConnolly Isn't it ever thus, though? Very rarely do you get whole nations eager for civil wars in particular.
1311790370704031752 2020-10-02 06:09:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation I think Arizona Senate is going to be on a razor's edge.
1311790219608424453 2020-10-02 06:08:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Thankfully I do not get those. I think I got Ilhan Omar's once. I did send some cash Trump's way yesterday, so getting a higher than usual number of texts today lol.   Only other candidate I'm considering contributing to (and you'll hate me for this) is Martha McSally.

1311785722882469891 2020-10-02 05:51:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> One thing I still believe from my libertarian days is that voting is, in fact, an exercise of violence/force. Government is force. That's just what it is. Voting is vesting the ability to use force in a person. People are finally waking to this.
1311784781995282432 2020-10-02 05:47:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner Given the account, I lean towards the latter. However, I would personally say this cynical garbage myself.
1311781246578634757 2020-10-02 05:33:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's October 1st. Election is November 3rd. 33 days. Yeah, at this point I'm 110% in the tank for Trump regardless of what happens.

1311529056249278465 2020-10-01 12:51:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The funny thing about “whataboutism” is that it’s a propaganda technique used by totalitarian regimes to suppress dissidents by pointing out their personal flaws...which is exactly what these people are doing when they complain about a personal flaw in their political opponents.
1311527028919762944 2020-10-01 12:43:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Anytime a purported Christian complains about someone doing “whataboutism” when you point out their blatant hypocrisy: “Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.”

What we're going through right now is an indirect result of 60-40 female college classes. This societal shift will be painful for everyone, but we will emerge from it.
1311402069534928902 2020-10-01 04:26:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mybrainmelted @DonnyCrypto The only time I stop talking to people over politics is when it's so obsessive they can't just sit back and enjoy a drink or going to the bowling alley.
1311401788273299459 2020-10-01 04:25:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mooncult @mybrainmelted @Witty_Crypto Consider what this says.
1311400455499583499 2020-10-01 04:20:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly I think the argument was that they didn't follow their own policies.
1311392186441891840 2020-10-01 03:47:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @altaccount1965 @SelimSeesYou He did
1311391827958919168 2020-10-01 03:45:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd BORING
1311389601697861632 2020-10-01 03:37:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @evelyn_waugh1 Thankfully this is just DC. Literally irrelevant for the electoral college. Tons of potential for garbage in NC and the Rust Belt, though.
1311388966613127168 2020-10-01 03:34:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Someone please tell me this sorts itself out. If you want a bigger shitshow than the debate last night, just wait until we have millions of trash ballots floating around.
1311387750994763777 2020-10-01 03:29:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ColumbiaBugle I feel like the quick helicopter presser is Trump's best format.
1311383981770895363 2020-10-01 03:14:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Yeah, it definitely seems more distinct to me as well.
1311381901349969921 2020-10-01 03:06:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CityBureaucrat Who doesn't love a man who loves trains?
1311381395655319552 2020-10-01 03:04:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I love looking back on these old clips of Trump. Hilarious.
1311374995961118720 2020-10-01 02:38:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed "I was just sitting here trying to write my latest insight into the Properly Basic nature of religious belief when I realize it's 86 degrees in my house. I'm sure we've all experienced something like this."
1311370842706771968 2020-10-01 02:22:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton This is kind of what happened in the 1920s. The Catholics started voting enough for the GOP we got the immigration restriction that characterized the 1920s-1965.
1311364545328435203 2020-10-01 01:57:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rufus38605416 @RedEaglePatriot They will always nitpick Trump. Literally no one could stand up to this insanity.
1311364152309547009 2020-10-01 01:55:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot I think they're all in on this crazy strat because if they can drag Biden across the finish line with it, they'll have carte blanche for a full crackdown on right-wing dissent.
1311363617497980939 2020-10-01 01:53:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @Fuckgsw2 @Peoples_Pundit @realDonaldTrump Yes, I'm still convinced this will be the story of this election.
1311362440676900868 2020-10-01 01:49:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly I just love this quote in these situations:  https://t.co/FBupDwPuv7
1311362121318445060 2020-10-01 01:47:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Fuckgsw2 @Peoples_Pundit @realDonaldTrump Seriously: This entire election is going to come down to convincing folks in exactly one rust belt state their Covid econ woes are entirely the result of their piss poor Democrat governors.

1311360136871661568 2020-10-01 01:39:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I mean, what else do they have? There are no real, significant "white supremacist" organizations in this country.
1311355744214806533 2020-10-01 01:22:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CaesarSalad99 The less politics is mentioned in the workplace the better. Of course, lefties now claim this is an inherently right wing idea.
1311354108742426625 2020-10-01 01:15:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads That was early and it is on the key issue Trump is losing on. Narrowing the gap on Covid will shift the race to the economy, which Trump wins on. I think we were seeing this already, but this helps for sure.
1311344686020395010 2020-10-01 00:38:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @EMP_999 @PunishedWld @SelimSeesYou No, he's just a libertarian and disagrees with anyone's legal interpretation that isn't.
1311344133328564224 2020-10-01 00:36:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @EMP_999 @PunishedWld @SelimSeesYou Barnes' opinion isn't the Gospel. He's also incredibly wrong about ACB and the political impact of her nomination.
1311343794541989888 2020-10-01 00:34:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @michellemalkin He's up in 2022. Someone needs to challenge him in the primary.
1311343211063934979 2020-10-01 00:32:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @EMP_999 @PunishedWld @SelimSeesYou So?
1311342720460500994 2020-10-01 00:30:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Oblivion2elect1 @SelimSeesYou They're just flat out liars.
1311341178550353920 2020-10-01 00:24:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Apparently he already is. Good.
1311341101631107074 2020-10-01 00:24:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou It's slander. I hope he gets to sue one day.
1311332441525813249 2020-09-30 23:49:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ttran9235 @RedEaglePatriot Worse.
1311332336986992642 2020-09-30 23:49:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Just a reminder the "oddsmakers" had Trump at like 17% day of election.
1311331579709587458 2020-09-30 23:46:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 @SelimSeesYou Yeah, he definitely left a lot on the table. It could have really been a rout. The left are really out of talking points now. The mildest cross examination destroys their insane policies.
1311330063011504130 2020-09-30 23:40:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Yo, they actually freaking did something slightly good. This has been a huge Dem talking point. LMAO.
1311329399984320514 2020-09-30 23:37:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 @SelimSeesYou He needs three good nights with his decline and the only reason he didn't completely f up last night as Trump didn't give him quite enough rope to hang himself.
1311327504016257025 2020-09-30 23:30:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Just remember that Trump and Pence are a bad cop/good cop routine.
1311327294863142912 2020-09-30 23:29:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Just consider: First debate is usually the worst for the incumbent. We're getting a great moment at the Townhall. And Pence will shine against Harris.
1311317784954114051 2020-09-30 22:51:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads She has been tolerable since getting unceremoniously canned from NBC.
1311302298052763650 2020-09-30 21:50:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Will you shut up, man?   LMAO.
1311163117892665344 2020-09-30 12:37:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is just such a tremendous L for the narrative. Imagine if Trump gets Bush levels of Hispanic support. Would blow people’s minds.
1311159513257574400 2020-09-30 12:22:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> My entire life, the left comes to these debates armed with “the experts say!” while the right comes armed with concrete factual details. Which do you trust?
1311158233961299974 2020-09-30 12:17:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Skelesorceror @realikamusume I mean, he has to know that’s a meme.
1311157666127978497 2020-09-30 12:15:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BigBoiBoiBoiBoi @ScottMGreer wHY dId yOU sAY tO DRiNk blEaCH?!?
1311156823110582273 2020-09-30 12:12:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Damn this is good news.
1311155548667154433 2020-09-30 12:06:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Freshtendies @WFlyte @NationalistTV I think all they’ll remember out of that is that California (who literally everyone associates with Democrats) is on fire and Biden doesn’t know if he supports GND.
1311154689824694274 2020-09-30 12:03:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Freshtendies @WFlyte @NationalistTV I actually liked his climate answers. Climate change isn’t a Democrat winner despite what pols think.
1311153585451864064 2020-09-30 11:59:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NorcalSailor @ScottMGreer One has it now and hasn’t used it.
1311153489146515456 2020-09-30 11:58:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump killed it. In an almost literal sense.
1311152196134854657 2020-09-30 11:53:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume He supports the Green New Deal, but he doesn’t. He has the worst of both worlds on that.
1311151692327587842 2020-09-30 11:51:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MuricaNumbaOne @thehangingchads There were also those.
1311144559431254017 2020-09-30 11:23:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_Rep00_ @thehangingchads Two key moments for Trump: Covid topic. He effectively made his case and attacked Biden on it. The other was when Biden endorsed the Green New Deal after denying supporting it and then switching back again.
1311144294099701768 2020-09-30 11:22:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_Rep00_ @thehangingchads 100% agree. Biden was barely even at the debate. People are acting like he succeeded because didn’t literally stroke out live on TV, but he still came across as weak, old, and confused.
1311143926720614407 2020-09-30 11:20:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WFlyte @NationalistTV Yeah, there were a few topics with clear winners. I honestly think Trump did well for Covid and that’s the only reason he’s even behind in the first place.
1311143505297895424 2020-09-30 11:19:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Eh, there were some moments he went too far. NGL. However, overall the style clearly works for him.
1311134811025739777 2020-09-30 10:44:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Like, he didn’t shit his pants, but he just didn’t really say much.
1311134567001190402 2020-09-30 10:43:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biden was barely present.
1311133677733261317 2020-09-30 10:40:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Shit show favors Trump. I’m telling you.
1311132617010544645 2020-09-30 10:35:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou BASED
1311130624455999488 2020-09-30 10:27:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Wait, does he support the green new deal or not?
1311127939136786434 2020-09-30 10:17:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> “Totally discredited.”
1311127695636520961 2020-09-30 10:16:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I didn’t particularly like Trump’s answer honestly.
1311127294342238208 2020-09-30 10:14:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I didn’t like Trump’s answer tbh.
1311126415006486530 2020-09-30 10:11:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It’s coming from the left not the right!
1311126063762878473 2020-09-30 10:09:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LueYee Dems always want to have their cake and eat it too. It’s their entire platform.
1311125913292206085 2020-09-30 10:09:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They shot him!
1311125062016212999 2020-09-30 10:05:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Were you raised in Scranton or the suburbs?
1311124419201445892 2020-09-30 10:03:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> YOU DID NOT GROW UP IN SCRANTON
1311122031564464134 2020-09-30 09:53:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Ok, this isn’t good right now.
1311121532416978944 2020-09-30 09:51:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp He doesn’t have one because they don’t have the truth.
1311121136974016512 2020-09-30 09:50:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biden needs to settle on an economy or Covid narrative.
1311120458209808384 2020-09-30 09:47:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Buy American Joe. Like, who believes this crap?
1311119003788685316 2020-09-30 09:41:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Like, seriously. This is important.
1311118738025000960 2020-09-30 09:40:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m so happy Trump is mentioning the other health hazards of Covid shutdowns.
1311117496380948481 2020-09-30 09:35:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump is getting the chance to make his case here and he’s making it effectively enough. He’s narrowing the gap on Covid.
1311116154077876225 2020-09-30 09:30:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Did Biden really mention the bleach crap?
1311114762349088769 2020-09-30 09:24:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Sick of this Covid crap. If you think Trump could have stopped disease, you’re really stupid.
1311113590548697089 2020-09-30 09:20:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Yeah, Biden is digging his own hole enough.
1311112245418635267 2020-09-30 09:14:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Biden seems shaky already to me.
1311110854398611456 2020-09-30 09:09:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> WE WON, YOU LOST, SUCK IT.
1311110785037410304 2020-09-30 09:09:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou WE WON, YOU LOST, SUCK IT

1311109999645650944 2020-09-30 09:05:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Biden is so old, he’s not even a boomer.
1311109833890951168 2020-09-30 09:05:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon is real.
1311108241091440640 2020-09-30 08:58:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> MAGA hat on!
1311081469918556161 2020-09-30 07:12:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @punishednrx @SelimSeesYou Winner of the 2020 election by KO: Donald Trump.
1311073346726100993 2020-09-30 06:40:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @realikamusume @SelimSeesYou Well, it’s not really a proper poll. It’s a collation of all the interviews they’ve done. It wouldn’t be 11% undecided, presumably 2-4% were for others. Just interesting because it is effectively a battleground states poll.
1311067411844665344 2020-09-30 06:16:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @realikamusume @SelimSeesYou Yeah, to be conservative I’d just assign 2/3 undecideds to Trump and call it a day. Could easily be 3/4 or 4/5.
1311065674966544384 2020-09-30 06:09:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 @SelimSeesYou Yeah, those were some dark days and Trump needed to find a way to stay in the war.
1311064198219169795 2020-09-30 06:03:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 @SelimSeesYou People actually thought he lost the campaign there because he was admitting she was smart. But, it was obvious normal people wouldn't take it that way: He gave her a legit compliment and she said something obviously canned and backhanded.
1311053858924363777 2020-09-30 05:22:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This was always the take that made the most common sense from an adversarial point of view. Sow discord by just obfuscating the results of a contentious election: No matter who wins.
1311033791922745344 2020-09-30 04:03:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Didn't Baris's poll give Trump the edge in Bucks? Very narrowly for Clinton last time, could definitely tip it.
1311030065732497408 2020-09-30 03:48:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_oumuamua @plzbepatient @s_pitchfork @SelimSeesYou I'd assume Seth Rich.
1311029015768166402 2020-09-30 03:44:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou It's like thinking some dude isn't guilty of murder because the cop didn't properly fill out the evidence locker entry on the murder weapon.
1311028768891449348 2020-09-30 03:43:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The left in this country is so delusional they won't believe the hardest evidence against their people. They make fun of Trump supporters for sticking by their guy, but there's hard evidence against them and they dismiss it on technicalities as if technicalities affect truth.
1311027663327375360 2020-09-30 03:38:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Like actually murder someone on Fifth Avenue level fuck up lol. Yeah, that's the big advantage Trump has: His support is far more locked in. Biden's support is far less reliable.
1311026907425714178 2020-09-30 03:35:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I mean, just look at the numbers the NYT shared today: 47-42 Biden. That's 11 points not for either. That's a lot of fluidity, in addition to potential mind changers.
1311026051833892866 2020-09-30 03:32:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I disagree with the conventional wisdom on this. Debates matter more than you'd think because there are more fluid voters than people think. Also, a good performance can energize a campaign and than has a boil over effect on fluid voters.
1311024985696276480 2020-09-30 03:28:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright You could literally watch it happen. But they just pretend like it was some big secret.
1311014893634584577 2020-09-30 02:48:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Accelerationism only works when you have positions of real, executive power. The people pushing "accelerationism" don't so much as have a Governor on their side.
1311012402624946177 2020-09-30 02:38:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theJackAndrews @SelimSeesYou One in Missouri had Trump up 1 in August 2016. He ended up winning by 20. You can't convince me it was a 1 point race in Missouri in August 2016.
1311010985394810894 2020-09-30 02:32:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LVB_19 @SelimSeesYou Nothing about any of this data makes sense. I mean, there was a poll showing Trump down almost 40 points among suburban voters in Pennsylvania. For that to happen, you'd have to have mass defections. Elected Republicans left and right would be denouncing Trump.
1311009286865158145 2020-09-30 02:25:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LVB_19 @SelimSeesYou Interesting thing about the poll is that it has Trump up among the Olds. Very odd given the national narrative.  Georgia has a tendency to break late for Republicans since 2008 (McCain outdid his average there as well).
1311007554617708551 2020-09-30 02:18:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LVB_19 @SelimSeesYou Typical garbage Quin poll. Add 10 to the GOP lol.
1311007245807816709 2020-09-30 02:17:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Harvard/Harris last night was good, though.   Also, not seeing a new poll in NC on RCP.
1311006946221338625 2020-09-30 02:16:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This poll also has Trump down by 3. But, interestingly, he's up among Olds. First time I've seen that in a while, but it is just Georgia.
1311002476573851648 2020-09-30 01:58:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Poll is recent, here is the link:  https://t.co/LXuBCtcvWd
1311002368243380230 2020-09-30 01:58:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 2/2  I find it very odd that these wild suburban swings just don't seem to pan out when you break it down in specific counties and districts.
1311002098117509122 2020-09-30 01:57:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Was just looking at a poll for CA-25. Interesting case study: Suburban district in very blue California with a cook PVI of EVEN that went for Clinton by 7. Found a D leaning poll that shows it going to Biden by 8, essentially even. 1/2  https://t.co/7YlV71TG1S
1310998789210152960 2020-09-30 01:44:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @VeriteJacques The district he won is nearly identical in profile to many Orange County seats. If anything, they lean farther right.
1310993404399095810 2020-09-30 01:22:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Yeah, the libs responding to this don't really seem to know how to read this data. It's rather funny, actually.
1310992516527861762 2020-09-30 01:19:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Interesting to not it appears red is dominating Orange County, California. Hopefully that's representative as it would be big for the GOP in the House.
1310990833232080897 2020-09-30 01:12:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is good data. This is a lot of uncommitted people, contrary to popular wisdom.
1310987351095681024 2020-09-30 00:58:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @groyper_boston @JCompson_III They got obsessive, man. Turning every issue back to the Jews as if no one else in the world has any agency at all. It was parody-levels of anti-semitism.
1310983236949094400 2020-09-30 00:42:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Every Anglo-Russian I know votes pretty much like me lol.

1310982105514627073 2020-09-30 00:37:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Yet another crossover no one expected to come out of 2020.
1310980620135337985 2020-09-30 00:31:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReformedMallard It seems the Christian thing to do is to pray Trump's faith is genuine regardless. I mean, it is kind of explicitly commanded of us.
1310973379529396225 2020-09-30 00:03:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @musculus_s @PerfInjust @mark_bauerlein Trump started his Presidential campaign with a 20% favorability rating among Republicans and was the frontrunner within a month or two. That's simply unprecedented. Something bigger than the petty stuff is clearly going on.
1310971970746568705 2020-09-29 23:57:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PerfInjust This is why many don't get his supporters. People think Trump supporters (especially the early ones) are particularly dedicated to this guy for some bizarre cultish reason. It's really that he exposes what they have long suspected true.  https://t.co/zJxkTKhTTF
1310962225537003521 2020-09-29 23:18:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TRElections I don't even think this is physically possible.
1310959851015671811 2020-09-29 23:09:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BladesOfChaos70 @SelimSeesYou We haven't been this close to civil war since the day before South Carolina seceded. Close calls have been avoided, though.
1310950781860884482 2020-09-29 22:33:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @QuickOne76 @PollWatch2020 @Peoples_Pundit Biden pay for an ad buy there that starts in about a week.
1310949306137014272 2020-09-29 22:27:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nc_groyp @thehangingchads @animegorilla They pretend it doesn't matter despite the fact that, at the end of the day, the only thing that matters is real people who turn in hard ballots.
1310949086036660229 2020-09-29 22:26:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @animegorilla @thehangingchads The only people who are still buying pollsters will believe pollsters no matter what.
1310943831467192327 2020-09-29 22:05:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Trump seems relatively stable around 45 while Biden's numbers bounce all over the place.  Odd.
1310812537127133185 2020-09-29 13:23:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Why would I waste 200 hours of my life on a shit game?
1310806902788493312 2020-09-29 13:01:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer Does anyone believe a dude with that physiognomy is anything but a right winger of some stripe?
1310803616027078670 2020-09-29 12:48:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TrustThePlant Being against rich people for the sake of being against rich people isn’t just. The problem isn’t that some people are good investors and make bank. The problem is more that our regulatory structure hasn’t caught up with modern technology.
1310803107719376902 2020-09-29 12:46:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TrustThePlant Who gets to decide this? When does a business expense cease being a business expense? When do you have to stop carrying over losses? When does depreciation no longer apply? When does a cash out refinance count as “income”?
1310801001511780352 2020-09-29 12:38:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AccurateCaption @ReactionaryIan It’s stupid, but it’s literally Rich Dad, Poor Dad tier stuff. Ann Coulter is someone who, if taken at face value, is dumb enough to live in two of the highest taxed states and not get a financial planner to structure investments. She’s equal to someone who just hit the lottery.
1310797216940990464 2020-09-29 12:23:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Ann Coulter is taxed a lot because she makes bank on books and high margin speaking gigs. She doesn’t really have expenses and apparently isn’t entrepreneurial enough to parlay these windfalls into long term investments that benefit society (like housing units).
1310795813950545922 2020-09-29 12:17:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is such a dumb take. Most of the elements of our tax code cannot be structured in such a way as to tax someone like Donald Trump without KILLING thin margin small businesses. If you want every rental unit to be owned by a megacorp, destroy depreciation and 1031 exchanges.
1310786847824580609 2020-09-29 11:41:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 Same pattern as last time really.
1310784470862254081 2020-09-29 11:32:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads That’s hitting goals right there.
1310781243752148992 2020-09-29 11:19:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer We didn’t exactly cheer John McCain at the County Convention in 2008 where I was (large enough county to not just be a bunch of bumpkins either).
1310775272090857474 2020-09-29 10:55:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK Poll day before the election shows Trump+5: Don’t worry, Biden has this in the electoral college!
1310774603611070465 2020-09-29 10:53:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I like how every time a poll comes out with narrow number for Trump the lefties who gobble up laughable Biden+9 polls are there to tell you this is impossible.
1310724751460106241 2020-09-29 07:35:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Trump 23, Biden 70.
1310721210104283143 2020-09-29 07:21:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This whole Trump tax business just shows why no one understands money and they don't keep much of it.
1310720863520591880 2020-09-29 07:19:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Sometimes Matt Walsh just has an incredibly boomer take on something incredibly silly and meaningless.
1310716383588757508 2020-09-29 07:01:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MuricaNumbaOne I think she’s American.
1310716256950124547 2020-09-29 07:01:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MuricaNumbaOne She blocked @BronzeCullis, she wasn’t banned.
1310716051479498752 2020-09-29 07:00:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks I was thinking about retracting my statement and adding video games, but I decided teenagers shouldn’t be on those either.
1310715519096553474 2020-09-29 06:58:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MuricaNumbaOne She’s a teenage Jewish convert to Catholicism who has a habit of attacking trads and also just having a very arrogant attitude online. Very typical teenage behavior, all things considered, but she’s a particularly bad example.
1310713316633964545 2020-09-29 06:49:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JanSkzretuski @BronzeCullis Given her backstory, I understand why. Doesn’t mean it’s healthy for her to have a huge online following boosting her ego.
1310713064908521472 2020-09-29 06:48:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I really don’t know who thought it was a good idea to give teens access to the Internet for anything other than school research.
1310712540515663872 2020-09-29 06:46:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis This girl is nuts. Need to ban teenagers from the Internet.
1310695624388628483 2020-09-29 05:39:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Yeah, it’s vaguely possible that you see a crazy blue state surge crushing Trump in the popular vote and Trump ekes out a series of wins in purple states.
1310684326066036741 2020-09-29 04:54:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @softsuthernwind Yes, and this is because it is particularly suited to cotton growth.
1310682489141301248 2020-09-29 04:47:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @softsuthernwind No, because there's a strip south of Little Dixie, but north of the far South that is more midwestern.
1310681526607245313 2020-09-29 04:43:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @softsuthernwind There's multiple lines because there's the "Little Dixie" portion of central Missouri and the Southern portion of the state is also culturally aligned.
1310680880051032065 2020-09-29 04:40:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Yeah, I trust the WSJ to report something that is at least effectively the truth. They won't make any waves cracking underground stories, but they also won't totally BS you about what's going on.
1310679516247986176 2020-09-29 04:35:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Missouri voting McCain was the only major good news for Republicans that night that I remember.
1310677810969796616 2020-09-29 04:28:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @horatio__92 1972 they voted for Nixon. Bush narrowly missed it twice.
1310676884678750208 2020-09-29 04:24:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Fun fact: The last time Minnesota voted for a losing Republican was 1916.
1310676261971296258 2020-09-29 04:22:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @realikamusume That's actually returning to historical norms for the GOP (though, Minnesota has been a thorn in their side for longer than elsewhere in the North). Republicans need Illinois, Washington, and Oregon long term for that map to work, though.
1310674863028400135 2020-09-29 04:16:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume It has been trending Republican overall since the 90s. Like, this isn’t the Minnesota that voted for Mondale over Reagan. Bush narrowly missed it twice. This is one reason I don’t like people complaining about the “Bush map,” the Bush and Trump maps are the same minus VA and CO.
1310658832671137798 2020-09-29 03:13:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot I really don't like the Barnes' take on this. His take seems to be to throw judicial conservatives under the bus to get some elusive, cheap political points. It won't work.
1310644822752079874 2020-09-29 02:17:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Joe Biden is one of the worst career liars in Washington and in a normal election, it would get actual press. Instead we're subject to endless speculation about the legality of Trump tax schemes.
1310643821785604103 2020-09-29 02:13:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CantusLaudanum I hear Armenia uses 40 width divisions and the Azeris use 20.
1310642451774877696 2020-09-29 02:08:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @RupertVonRipp My favorites when I was a kid were all the illegals driving cars whose side panels were 90% bondo.
1310642322263150593 2020-09-29 02:07:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @RupertVonRipp That's a lower percentage of the East Coast pop than the outer burbs in California, though. SFO only has about 900K people compared to an SF Bay pop of 7.7 million. NYC has 8 million out of 18 million in the NYC metro. Population East is more dense by physical necessity.
1310640663185195008 2020-09-29 02:00:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @realikamusume This is one reason California is full of old beater cars. They just last forever if they've been in California for their entire service life. Roads salts aren't an issue, etc.
1310639624239357958 2020-09-29 01:56:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @RupertVonRipp I'm from the Bay Area and most of the Bay Area has much larger lot sizes than back east here. The middle inner bay (Alameda, San Mateo, San Fran) are very dense, but lot sizes are massive once you get into the outer, north, and south bays compared to anything in the NE.
1310639234684981248 2020-09-29 01:55:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @RupertVonRipp At least they aren't molding. Stuff in California lasts a lot longer because of the dry weather (btw, the reason your roads suck is most states started using California road standards, which don't work in humid climates).
1310638666658832384 2020-09-29 01:53:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @realikamusume California you have to tend to the water supply, but most of the soil is rich. Water has been horribly mismanaged.
1310637742167076867 2020-09-29 01:49:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @RupertVonRipp East coast where? California lot sizes are massive for anything north of the Rappahannock River.
1310637161637609472 2020-09-29 01:47:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Also, nothing says California quite like urban sprawl lol.
1310637059892219905 2020-09-29 01:46:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Personally, I like open floor concepts. I guess this is my native Californian showing.
1310634834524549125 2020-09-29 01:37:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW Yeah, you do have to consider crosstabs have a significantly higher margin of error than the top line numbers.
1310633229536432129 2020-09-29 01:31:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Uhh....Trump -7 among youngs and -12 among olds. That's pretty shocking.
1310632912853831688 2020-09-29 01:30:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BritishConserv3 @realikamusume That's within the margin of error. Some of these polls have Trump losing Indies by like 20-30, which is just ridiculous.
1310630553834663936 2020-09-29 01:20:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @realikamusume Jo Jorgenson has actually been floating around as a potential Lolbert nominee for ages: She was the Veep choice back in 1996 (seriously, lol).
1310629190400708608 2020-09-29 01:15:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Those SCOTUS numbers are excellent for Trump.
1310627640538271748 2020-09-29 01:09:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @zattack2016 @realikamusume I'm hopeful it will dawn on people everything about Covid would be better if it weren't for the awful decisions of Democratic governors.
1310625956801978374 2020-09-29 01:02:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume We have never seen an America with this large of an economic divide based on state government decisions. We really don't know how it will influence the election.
1310625694083428352 2020-09-29 01:01:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I think this is one reason why we *might* see Florida vote significantly to the right of a typical swing state this year. The economy is just so much better there. Then Trump just has to convince voters in 1 of the 4 rust belt states the economy is their governor's fault.
1310622686238912512 2020-09-29 00:49:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad Blackstone Legal Fellowship is pretty good, though.
1310612167482376192 2020-09-29 00:07:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou There’s a non-zero chance of just about anything.
1310609825852686336 2020-09-28 23:58:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads To be fair, I think they’re so used to lying (especially about Trump) that it’s just reflexive at this point.
1310608363227619329 2020-09-28 23:52:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads "Joe Biden tried to screw you over 30 years ago. Now you have to recuse yourself when he tries to screw over America!"
1310606164682518528 2020-09-28 23:43:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CaesarSalad99 It's pretty beautiful when it's not on fire.
1310604941229273089 2020-09-28 23:39:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Jo Jorgenson was really hoping this would rescue her campaign.
1310601145371570176 2020-09-28 23:23:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MuricaNumbaOne @JacobCLloyd There are some strong pro-Israel personalities, but this doesn't really define daily Evangelical life. Also, not all people who identify as Evangelical are dogmatically pro-Israel.
1310599886048497664 2020-09-28 23:18:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd Evangelicals get publicly maligned by literally everyone. Sick of this crap. I can guarantee they were praying about America.
1310586728223322112 2020-09-28 22:26:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy were reliable GOP votes on election issues and Roberts is more conservative than they were.
1310583974935158784 2020-09-28 22:15:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I really need to get a job covering the Biden campaign. Would love to call it a day at 9:30 every morning.
1310582596208918534 2020-09-28 22:10:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 That's good. Genuine tax evasion is obviously sinful.
1310581775350071296 2020-09-28 22:06:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 I guess we should all feel guilty taking a tax deduction.
1310574745813946380 2020-09-28 21:39:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wandlearner Even when we “get back to nature” and do things like go camping, it’s in an incredibly controlled environment compared to historical realities.
1310436532206137344 2020-09-28 12:29:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Conquestian @AnglicanMan19 Well, I don’t think it’s really saying that (though, I do believe we have a general obligation to be charitable to our neighbors). I think it’s more saying that we shouldn’t dwell on negative things. A lot of right wingers have a tendency to do this and it wraps their minds.

1310435135976812544 2020-09-28 12:24:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Conquestian @AnglicanMan19 I was thinking of Philippians 4:8.
1310432085983875073 2020-09-28 12:12:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wandlearner @AnglicanMan19 The bottom really fell out in the 2010s for some reason. Like, it was obviously not doing so hot before that, but then it’s just “we’re going crazy now!”
1310428432510185474 2020-09-28 11:57:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 Maybe that’s why Paul said not to think about it.

1310425054312894467 2020-09-28 11:44:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaleoEconomist It only makes sense as a power ranking. But then I’d have to put the party leaders in Tier A just by virtue of their position.
1310424040729964544 2020-09-28 11:40:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rufus38605416 @realikamusume @Barnes_Law There’s a split in the right wing judicial camp between conservatives and libertarians and Barnes falls squarely in the libertarian camp and ACB in the conservative camp. The conservatives are far more deferential to the powers of the other branches when there is doubt.
1310422143457427457 2020-09-28 11:32:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DickCha38486361 @Gravelord_Kyle It was a market economy. Everything else about capitalism is details.
1310422014956638210 2020-09-28 11:32:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Gravelord_Kyle This is why I can’t stand the edgy “third way” types. There are only two options: Market or command economy. There is no secret third option.
1310421540689846278 2020-09-28 11:30:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Gravelord_Kyle @KagutBlood Democracy is literally just communism for the government.

1310413025065791488 2020-09-28 10:56:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation California net lost half a million White middle class people every year between 2000 and like 2015 to internal migration. It is reaching an equilibrium now, but that’s a lot of people. Everywhere you go you find members of the California diaspora.
1310410344892899329 2020-09-28 10:45:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume The Democrats will have to remain disciplined and keep the issues to abortion and healthcare. No personal attacks on her religion or anything like that.
1310407875404103680 2020-09-28 10:35:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 @realikamusume He can stay equal, but, yeah, seems like it’s nearly impossible to not do better just by random accident.
1310405895285858305 2020-09-28 10:28:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I honestly don’t see Trump doing 10 points better with non-college Whites unless he really drives turnout to beyond historically unprecedented levels.

1310399389396078592 2020-09-28 10:02:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JohnPaulBarber I’m seeing more Biden signs, but Biden is a slightly less embarrassing candidate to admit you support than Hillary. I’m in a heavily D area and you can tell, but not by much.
1310398950512488455 2020-09-28 10:00:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @evan4905 @SelimSeesYou If he stopped doing that, then he’d have to never do it again and that could wreck his finances. He probably isn’t very liquid.
1310397188619599872 2020-09-28 09:53:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume He literally can’t get worse with black women.
1310394287813808130 2020-09-28 09:41:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume That’s just weird.

1310383691307397120 2020-09-28 08:59:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume They’re trying to meme it into reality.
1310383596147011584 2020-09-28 08:59:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 Oh, yeah. Not saying they’re staunch defenders over there. But at least they do exist.
1310382334324154370 2020-09-28 08:54:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @KingBroly I do wonder how that impacts Superior, Wisconsin.
1310382038168600576 2020-09-28 08:53:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 @realRonDeSantis Yeah, once you get to the nitty gritty of raw votes you realize how few people any national race really hinges on. Like, this race will come down to a few hundred thousand in the rust belt at most.
1310376131556790272 2020-09-28 08:29:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep In California: Largely yes.
1310375642358329344 2020-09-28 08:27:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep I think they included it later, but 1850 was the first census with any measurable Hispanic pop and people mostly just thought of them as Spanish.
1310375390150561793 2020-09-28 08:26:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @realikamusume Could see a narrower margin in Texas and some other red states too. I think that will play a role in the final popular vote tallies. I definitely think it’s in the realm of possibility.
1310374816264925186 2020-09-28 08:24:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep I think Hispanics were counted as pure Whites. I believe LA was a largely Hispanic ranching town at the time.
1310374456624394240 2020-09-28 08:23:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis I’d ignore them tbh. They’ll be different tomorrow. Some of these polls have the White vote at like 60%, a 10% collapse from last election.
1310374063337025536 2020-09-28 08:21:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 @realRonDeSantis 74 million votes seems plausible. But north of 75 and we’re starting to talk about really dragging out a lot of hidden Democrats.
1310373685967101952 2020-09-28 08:20:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 @realRonDeSantis Some of these people need to contrast the numbers they’re getting with some projected raw vote totals. If we have the same turnout as last election, they’re saying Biden will get 74 million votes. If it ends up being around 140-145 million, it’s 76-78 million. Unlikely.
1310372138713579525 2020-09-28 08:13:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis You can’t tell me ABC/WaPo polls are reliable when they have Trump down 10 nationally and up 4 in Florida at the same time. One of them has to be pretty far off the mark.
1310368754744913920 2020-09-28 08:00:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @zattack2016 @realikamusume Romney was a vulture capitalist. He was the type of Wall Street person people aren’t naturally sympathetic to and he only played into that by running from it.
1310368499743809536 2020-09-28 07:59:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume As a rule, it’s not right to run from your record like Romney did. He could have played into his Wall Street culture capitalist persona and said he wants to use those tools for America in some way. Problem was that he really didn’t.
1310367856685715457 2020-09-28 07:56:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @realikamusume I think Dems think it will help with the White working class, but White working class people aren’t socialists and never have been. They really don’t care that rich people have money. They certainly don’t hold them personally at fault lowering their tax burden.
1310367317193306113 2020-09-28 07:54:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume They’re really just trying to make it sound like Trump is a privileged tax evader and, therefore, unpatriotic. I don’t think people buy this and this was litigated last election when a smaller portion of his taxes were released.
1310366622499196929 2020-09-28 07:52:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Econotheist This is the root of much Papist error.
1310361620615491584 2020-09-28 07:32:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BluntandHonesty @KurtSchlichter That is literally what sex trafficking is.
1310360500518219776 2020-09-28 07:27:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> My two cents is that Trump has a chance to defend his record at the debates. This is what all incumbents do, but Trump is unique in that he doesn’t have many mainstream defenders outside Fox News. It’s a chance to say his piece on a level playing field.
1310358049127829506 2020-09-28 07:17:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is the traditional incumbent analysis. If you still think of Trump along traditional lines, you’re beyond reason. He wasn’t a traditional candidate, didn’t run a traditional campaign, and isn’t a traditional incumbent. Traditional analysis doesn’t work.
1310340156117913600 2020-09-28 06:06:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad Most people are at the public option level, not public healthcare. Get people with preexisting conditions onto Medicare more easily and 70+% of the public will be satisfied.
1310339743377494022 2020-09-28 06:05:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Does any driver in the Commonwealth of Virginia know how to signal when changing lanes or just keep to one lane?
1310336374365663233 2020-09-28 05:51:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I believe you have a moral obligation to lower your personal tax burden to the lowest reasonable level as provided for by law.
1310333775390355456 2020-09-28 05:41:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeardedDraygon Yes. If you do it according to the law, it’s 110% fine and you’d be a fool to do it any other way.
1310331832777531395 2020-09-28 05:33:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Did you know real estate moguls maximize their profits through properly structuring their taxes to show loss? You did if you watched literally any real estate professional on YouTube.
1310309580388220930 2020-09-28 04:05:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 @EsquireTargary1 @realikamusume Dems have once again misread the electorate and Trump will capitalize in the end. They think people are hungry for left economics and social policy and they just aren’t. Obama got a second term by a hair only due to low GOP enthusiasm and a bad candidate.
1310308927263834117 2020-09-28 04:02:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad In all reality, the average Southern Baptist is more Catholic than the average Democrat voting “Catholic.” I mean that with no irony at all.
1310308581330223105 2020-09-28 04:01:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad I think being confirmed and not an active atheist is enough to be Catholic in the lib worldview.

1310270049316491267 2020-09-28 01:28:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sappergieb @realikamusume Yeah, pre-Covid Trump would have been cruising because of this. Covid has interrupted this, but even the polls indicate people aren’t really blaming Trump for the Covid economy.
1310268236064227338 2020-09-28 01:21:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @shuggabumfairy Oh, yes, let’s just incentivize the opposite party to trump up charges the moment they have control of the House.
1310266171153944582 2020-09-28 01:12:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III There are ways of doing it, but they involve government subsidies.

1310086666091147265 2020-09-27 13:19:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Looks like the polls are following the same pattern as 2016: Bunch of  tight horse race polls, then a spate of “Trump down big everywhere!” polls.
1310079239375532032 2020-09-27 12:50:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp California is renowned for this BS.
1310078599890952193 2020-09-27 12:47:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> He does this by EO so his successor can just keep kicking the can down the road.

Those are still viable methods. A public person can legally create a defense fund for him and get a PO Box to accept checks.

I can easily see a stooge failing to bring up the counsel issue.
1310074942973771776 2020-09-27 12:33:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Hawkins at 3% is pretty ridiculous. Ralph Nader got 2.74% and he's assuredly the most popular Green ever.
1310073416196722688 2020-09-27 12:26:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I don't want to put too much stock in this type of stuff, but his campaign acts very funny. If they thought he was up by 10, I think they'd have cancelled the debate by now. Like, if they're that far ahead, it's only risky to let a debate happen.
1310072563691851786 2020-09-27 12:23:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReactionaryIan @SlightlyBlind @RupertVonRipp @trajan_decius @johnnyj44067880 @CassandraRules It appears his case is still pending appeal, but I'm not able to access who his attorney on the appeal is.

Like, seriously, being denied your own attorney and being FORCED to accept a certain Counselor is a major violation of the Sixth Amendment.
1310069291866296320 2020-09-27 12:10:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SlightlyBlind @ReactionaryIan @RupertVonRipp @trajan_decius @johnnyj44067880 @CassandraRules Kentucky v. Dennison was a case in 1860 the decided that governors could ignore this provision of the constitution, effectively.
1310069136521916417 2020-09-27 12:09:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SlightlyBlind @ReactionaryIan @RupertVonRipp @trajan_decius @johnnyj44067880 @CassandraRules Unfortunately, no. They'd just take him to Federal Court from State Prison. Even if he found some way to do that, once pardoned and released, the Constitution obliges states to honor each other's arrest warrants and, unfortunately, Dennison was overturned in the 80s.
1310067209671249920 2020-09-27 12:02:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @No2Sovereignty @ReactionaryIan Yeah, I think "King James" referencing Lebron James is itself related to the King James Bible. I mean, most American homes still have the King James in them even if they rarely read it.
1310066308529225728 2020-09-27 11:58:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReactionaryIan @RupertVonRipp @trajan_decius @johnnyj44067880 @CassandraRules Unfortunately, he can't do that as he was convicted at the state level. Only the Governor of Virginia can pardon him and good luck getting Ralph Northam to pardon him.
1310064602550538241 2020-09-27 11:51:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I like Girdusky, but he just looks like a total poseur here.

1310053615554494465 2020-09-27 11:08:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Sometimes I wish I didn't have weird opinions. Then I remember that would be boring.
1310052368470417409 2020-09-27 11:03:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad There's an Obamacare case coming up next year that could overturn it. They're going to argue she's the fifth vote.
1310050209309786116 2020-09-27 10:54:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad They're trying the healthcare angle, which isn't something I had quite thought about. Has a better chance at succeeding than the abortion angle, but I doubt it tbh.
1310040634972082177 2020-09-27 10:16:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @Wasperation I don't really follow any at all, but I will watch the local hockey team and go to baseball games. They're just fun.
1310040075770658818 2020-09-27 10:14:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation @LAGalaxy Very true, but I think the team combat football mimics is most suited to an amateur environment and it really loses its luster in the professional sphere.
1310038860206936066 2020-09-27 10:09:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Basketball's white popularity has really taken a nosedive in the past decade. Those same types of fans have migrated to hockey in my experience.   Baseball is just so enjoyable to casually watch in person. Very involved for the dedicated fan, though.
1310038461458657281 2020-09-27 10:08:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Also, in a similar vain, high school and college football is way more fun than pro football. I always enjoyed going to the game and cheering for OUR team. I don't have the same attachment to any professional sports. Watching pro baseball is watching men do athletic art, though.
1310037071436931078 2020-09-27 10:02:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation I really don't understand how football came to just take control of the American sports world. There was a time when it was a distant second and only a little ahead of basketball.
1310035679611695117 2020-09-27 09:56:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Democrats are always fearful evil racist Southerners will drive Blacks from the polls. That's the root of their bizarre, conspiratorial ideas of election rigging. The GOP is more concerned with actual ballot tampering with real votes cast.
1310035053318221825 2020-09-27 09:54:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou You might think the Progressives had gotten their way with the Warren and Burger Courts, but those Courts were about broadly interpreting legal rights based on this idea of there being an implied compact to expand American liberty. This doesn't go far enough for the modern Prog.
1310034451502637058 2020-09-27 09:52:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou The wokeness is essentially an ideology designed specifically to use the Courts to enforce the leftist agenda. There's other facets of it obviously, but it's targeted at liberal arts students who go to law school and eventually come to essentially be the law. It's a power grab.
1310033970621489152 2020-09-27 09:50:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou The primary reason amnesty was ever able to pass Congress in 1986 was the provision to really hurt employers of illegal immigrants (there were no penalties previous), but this has not been enforced. Now it has become this social justice issue it never was.
1310033599870181378 2020-09-27 09:48:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou This is why the Bush I Presidency was so disastrous. He (intentionally) failed to follow up on any of the immigration concessions extracted for amnesty, got Clinton elected, and lost California in the process.
1310032195034243072 2020-09-27 09:43:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou I also think if the 94 Referendum was upheld, it would have eventually become national law as California is very influential in the political process and California Republicans would demand candidates support it.
1310031877575774209 2020-09-27 09:41:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou It would be a much slower demographic crisis, and one with rational policy obstacles. The primary driver of US Hispanic population explosion is illegal immigration with anchor babies and the driver for that is California Agriculture. Without that driver, it would be much slower.

1310030894040834061 2020-09-27 09:37:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou If the 94 referendum had went through, California probably would be a lean-D swing state.
1310030761559502852 2020-09-27 09:37:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Seriously. If the courts had let 94 Referendum (an eminently reasonable piece of legislation) stand in particular, we really wouldn't be in this spot.   I think only one state approved gay marriage by referendum, and that was Maine 53-47. NY did approve it legislatively.

1310025501298380800 2020-09-27 09:16:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @IVMiles Other countries have Constitutional Courts whose sole job it is to answer constitutional questions. This seems like a better model than combining the mundane tasks of procedural jurisprudence with the grand task of determine the constitutionality of a major act of congress.
1310025131071242240 2020-09-27 09:15:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @IVMiles It seems the Founders thought everyone involved should play some role in determining the constitutionality of legislation and I think that's right, but it really does seem the judiciary is best equipped to be a true arbiter of these cases.

1310010189622513669 2020-09-27 08:15:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IVMiles Like, if the Supreme Court can’t decide an act of Congress conflicts with the constitution, what power do they have to check Congress (or the Presidency?) If Congress is really brazen and passes an ex post facto law by simple majority, how does the judiciary handle an appeal?
1310009773132259335 2020-09-27 08:14:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IVMiles The problem I find is that without judicial review, the judicial branch is really powerless. With it, it can be far too powerful in practice. I’m not really sure if there is a solution to this conundrum.

Reagan was better and would have been great sans the Borking. Bush I and II appointees are better overall. Federalist Society is now at full strength and will impact this.

Sometimes you have to confront the ghouls with their evil. You don’t have to shove images of aborted fetuses in the face of your dorm mate who doesn’t really care about politics.
1309996674992013317 2020-09-27 07:22:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp These people being the pro-abortion ghouls

1309996459174043648 2020-09-27 07:21:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I understand what they’re trying to do, but that’s one thing that puts people off about the most radical pro-life elements too. The “Abortion Abolitionist” types have a tendency to shove morbid images in your face and demand immediate moral capitulation. 1/2
1309993665125920768 2020-09-27 07:10:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp That seems to be the public middle, yes, but difficult to tell. Polling is all over the place. One sure thing is that people don’t like abortion glorification. They’re far more put off by that than super Evangelical Southern grandma who is uber-prolife.
1309991611472977925 2020-09-27 07:01:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Abortion will not move the needle one bit. The “extreme” positions are at least equal strength. Most are in the middle. The only attacks on ACB will only serve to alienate voters to the Democrats.

1309936445797302274 2020-09-27 03:22:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JBFalke @AnglicanMan19 That’s what they said then. But Trump should have known better and began pumping up mask production 4 years ago. Or something.
1309932566754070528 2020-09-27 03:07:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 I can get the “buck stops here” argument, but I mean, they seem to really believe a few extra masks in March would have prevented some great catastrophe that has supposedly befallen us.
1309923020169977861 2020-09-27 02:29:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Is this where we’re at as a country: We believe that government can stop disease and only selecting the correct Presidential Candidate will prevent disease?
1309922644997935107 2020-09-27 02:27:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m still trying to figure out what people wanted Trump to do about the pandemic that he didn’t do. The main criticism from the left seems to be that he should have ramped up mask production a week sooner or something.

1309685355474542592 2020-09-26 10:44:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Hakasays @realikamusume What I mean to say is that merely identifying a mail ballot as elections mail seems like a literacy test.

ACB has a lot of recorded right wing opinions on a lot of issues.
1309682672973893632 2020-09-26 10:34:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_bregna @Theo_Chilton As for other examples: Rehnquist never drifted left. Scalia never drifted left. Alito is MORE conservative than when he was appointed. Byron White was appointed by JFK and never moved left.
1309681817310711808 2020-09-26 10:30:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_bregna @Theo_Chilton I’m not saying she’s some kind of singlehanded champion of Reaction or something who will finally be the one to stop this madness. Also, first Roe has to be challenged before it can be overturned, which it probably won’t.
1309680098912735233 2020-09-26 10:24:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_bregna @Theo_Chilton Looks like we’re to the hard right “spin the wheel” of insults. Just take the L.
1309679470563950594 2020-09-26 10:21:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_bregna @Theo_Chilton I literally provided you one counterexample and I can give others. Justices simply don’t do this. Their ideologies are relatively predictable and they do not change significantly. Even Roberts was always a center-right guy. ACB will rule against any of the crap you’ve mentioned.
1309678051802968067 2020-09-26 10:15:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_bregna @Theo_Chilton That’s a separate issue from the idea that Amy Coney Barrett is some kind of secret leftist, which is what you were saying. Most justices have a set ideology once they get on the court and move little over time. Thomas is no less conservative today than the day he was confirmed.
1309676575252717568 2020-09-26 10:10:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_bregna @Theo_Chilton You’re paranoid.
1309675529193295873 2020-09-26 10:05:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_bregna @Theo_Chilton You have to be pretty deep to think Amy Coney Barrett will rule in favor of any of that. Unless you think she’s some deep cover leftist, but if she is, who couldn’t be?
1309673424583884802 2020-09-26 09:57:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_bregna @Theo_Chilton Press X. What is there left to expand at this point?
1309672980843245568 2020-09-26 09:55:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I mean, I think Biden was joking, but his delivery was absolutely terrible and it doesn’t really appear he was joking.
1309672654048239617 2020-09-26 09:54:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Salve_font @SelimSeesYou It’s also one reason why democracy. Justice only gets done when someone in authority very keenly tells these type of people to go fuck themselves.

The thing is, we just have to stick to our guns. Because, ultimately, the only poll that matters is the actual people turning in a real ballot.
1309668191564713984 2020-09-26 09:36:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cathandler @ScottMGreer I can’t wait.

1309619425168027648 2020-09-26 06:22:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NullusMaximus Trump narrowly defeated the establishment and Trumpism will be virtually outlawed by then, let alone something more radical. Just do us all a favor and vote Trump instead of indulging your fantasies.
1309617552759365632 2020-09-26 06:15:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @evan4905 @SelimSeesYou Like, if Trump wins, why not just go forward in the lame duck?

1309615749623885826 2020-09-26 06:08:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NullusMaximus Sounds like uselessly burying guns. And really? The people will just show up and nominate Ted Cruz if we’re LUCKY. More likely we’ll get a cringe version of Mike Pence or Haley or someone equally bad.

1309607879939444737 2020-09-26 05:37:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NullusMaximus It’s funny you think 90% of gun owners wouldn’t just surrender their arms or simply uselessly bury them if the Feds did another round of AWB. Tell me: Who is your mysterious White Horse Andrew Jackson that is going to show up in 4 years?
1309606877156777986 2020-09-26 05:33:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NullusMaximus Like, no, and it's honestly funny you still believe these fantasies. We literally have leftists rioting in the streets right now and you're like "we gotta push them more with Biden." I guess that's after all our guns are taken away at the order of a packed court.  https://t.co/mU8UkyB3uf

1309569137514078209 2020-09-26 03:03:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @SelimSeesYou The only thing that saved the GOP from an utter disaster was diehard Trumpist turning out in the millions. The Republicans had a record breaking vote total that year themselves. Indies broke for Dems by 12 points is the sole reason it was such a big house victory.
1309568208387489795 2020-09-26 02:59:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @SelimSeesYou The Democrats' only argument is a fundamentally conservative argument: Vote for Biden to return to normalcy. "Normalcy" is basically the definition of conservatism. Their argument is a cosmic joke that will easily fall flat in the debates, even if Trump isn't great in them.
1309567519716454400 2020-09-26 02:56:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @thehangingchads Democrats keep misreading the electorate, thinking they're hungry for leftist policies and "anti-racism" or whatever. They're not. The Democratic Party has not increased in identification or public perception even in the wake of their 2018 victories.
1309566848170684419 2020-09-26 02:54:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @thehangingchads The problem for Biden is the same as the problem for Hillary: Their support is a lot more fickle and capped lower in key states. There's not going to be any late break for Biden. If you still have an open mind for Trump at this point, there isn't some torpedo that will kill him.
1309558937499447296 2020-09-26 02:22:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Nevada really has visceral knowledge that the economy is bad from Democrat lockdowns. The Vegas economy thrives on everything shut down right now and they're really not happy with it.

1309557931235520514 2020-09-26 02:18:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RacistClip @thehangingchads I really am concerned about labeling any domestic group that hasn't been convicted of any crime under RICO a "terrorist" group. Sets bad precedent. I think we can go after Antifa under RICO. But who knows what exactly being labeled a "terrorist" group does legally?

1309532335902257152 2020-09-26 00:36:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I really think Republicans hit their nadir in California in 2016-18. They might not improve this election, but it's difficult for me to see them collapsing even further in the state. I hope Trump reclaims Orange County, though, especially for the sake of the House.
1309531571163205632 2020-09-26 00:33:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume My one concern on this front is that it assumes a uniform swing. We might see a situation where Trump doesn't improve at all in blue states, and perhaps actually falls there, while improving significantly in swing and red states. Blue states are raw vote rich.
1309529853985783808 2020-09-26 00:27:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This will end up being the story of the election: Suburban swing state moms and dads buying a gun and quietly voting Trump.

1309519205369352193 2020-09-25 23:44:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer These people are so weird.
1309518148056551425 2020-09-25 23:40:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CantusLaudanum That’s because they were literally going to coup him if he tried to use the military.
1309517670358843393 2020-09-25 23:38:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CantusLaudanum The Feds are doing what they can about it pre-election. They’ve arrested a lot of people and Portland has somewhat died down because of it.
1309516825072414720 2020-09-25 23:35:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep DeBlasio is on the list? The dude isn’t even popular in New York.
1309516564144812032 2020-09-25 23:34:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CantusLaudanum He is already doing most of it. This just allows his EOs to continue.
1309514764574490628 2020-09-25 23:27:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Joe Biden:  -BLM wins -Amnesty -More wars -Conservatives removed from social media and driven underground  Donald Trump:  -BLM loses: CRT commissions established -No amnesty -Less wars -Leftist mobs imprisoned  The choice is clear.
1309513974933860352 2020-09-25 23:23:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @meat_wilson @RyanGirdusky Literally every poll says it besides one that had him at like 8% for Blacks. Nearly all the polls have Trump in the mid 30s for Latinos with room for improvement as Biden usually sits in the 50s. This is just a return to historic pre-Obama voting patterns.
1309512572178173952 2020-09-25 23:18:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAtheology Just FYI, the set on the right is like 120 bucks new on Amazon.

1309507982535938050 2020-09-25 23:00:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky Also, Trump is not getting as low of a vote share of minorities as he did last time. Likely somewhere in the double digits for Blacks and 35% or so for Hispanics.
1309507777971195905 2020-09-25 22:59:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky Haven't they done the work needed here?
1309506784655224832 2020-09-25 22:55:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Also had Florida 43-46 Biden. If Trump can win both Florida and Arizona, it's really not looking good for Biden. Trump is going into the debate with a lot of momentum.
1309506411534135297 2020-09-25 22:53:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @smitallica @PpollingNumbers @DataProgress That's pretty consistent, actually.

1309503526201184257 2020-09-25 22:42:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Another way that I think is more possible than it appears is an incredibly high turnout election where the Republicans are just a little bit better at getting their people out than Democrats, but Democrat turnout is fueled by self-motivated college educated women:  https://t.co/2eWsCHMZxB

1309501342508109824 2020-09-25 22:33:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @bronzeagemantis @EricGascho Landslide. Notably I think New Mexico and Colorado would flip here (CO would stay blue and NM would go red) because part of the reason he is doing better in the "Other" category is Natives in New Mexico.  https://t.co/NF45re7BkS

Trump has made a lot of gains in every Asian community except the Chinese, which aren't actually a large voting bloc in the United States.
1309499646151143424 2020-09-25 22:26:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NamelessHorse_ The minority vote shares are about average for what we are seeing. Basically the only two conjectures here are:  1. WWC increased turnout by 5% while everyone else stays about equal. 2. A small shy Trump vote factor among college educated Whites.

The minority vote shares are about average for what we are seeing, I just have a small shy Trump vote factor among the college educated and 5% increase in WWC turnout, but a slightly smaller vote share.  https://t.co/nDzAtVpses

1309490084308234241 2020-09-25 21:48:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Yeah. It’s because more people try online dating and women are naturally more selective when online dating than men. IRL these women can be totally different.

1309273959838429185 2020-09-25 07:30:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 It really depends on the final makeup of the caucus and what the Democrats agree to pass. In the event of a trifecta, I tend to think we will see a 1-2 seat gain in the Senate for the GOP with Jason Lewis winning in MN. Would bode well for the caucus.

They’re crazy skeptical of all things government and assume the worst of anyone running for office, even someone like Trump. Very hard group to reach.

There was just a lot more social pressure to hate Trump here than, say, suburban Dallas. By the same token it would underestimate the rally effect in 2020 here for similar reasons.

You might want them to be more generous for some reason with the definition, but this Congressional District shouldn’t be denied their seat in the House because some random guy got 5% of the vote in a State Auditor election. That’s ridiculous.

He lost it by like 200K votes more than Romney and still only ran about a point and half behind Romney. He really drove up downstate turnout. Narrowing the race here is good because it’s an expensive state.

1309234829062533126 2020-09-25 04:54:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JcantorWeinberg @sarahnferris Minnesota is crazy generous with its definition of "major party." Also, I can guarantee you this law was passed because of Paul Wellstone's unfortunate accident.
1309231497937915904 2020-09-25 04:41:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Every time some Dem brings up healthcare as an issue, I'm reminded of the fact that the Dems specifically designed Obamacare to fail because things like Medicare4All and single payer were WILDLY unpopular with the American electorate 10-12 years ago.
1309229313515040768 2020-09-25 04:32:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WC_Fox @RedEaglePatriot Yeah, Obamacare has never really been huge above water even on its good days. From the moment they enacted it, the plan was to create something bad to push for something more radical later to bludgeon Republicans. These people are diabolical.
1309228955799564291 2020-09-25 04:31:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LVB_19 @RedEaglePatriot That’s not possible without a law passed by Congress.
1309226770433019905 2020-09-25 04:22:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 @Theo_Chilton James Buckley was elected Conservative Senator from New York from 1971-1977. He caucused with the GOP. Bob Smith temporarily left the GOP in 1999, but that was kind of a fiasco, he came back quickly, and he was elected as a Republican. Not sure if Dean Barkley caucused at all.
1309224829057470480 2020-09-25 04:14:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @softsuthernwind I don't even get the point. A lot of people act like the most sacred right you have is the right to mark a box and stick the paper in another box once every 4 years.
1309221594284412929 2020-09-25 04:02:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 @Theo_Chilton I keep forgetting that. The 55-45 is worse than it looks too because there were even more moderate McCain types than there were even in 2017. Murkowski, Collins, Snowe, McCain, et. al. were even less reliable votes on even stuff like judicial nominees than the 2017 caucus.
1309221225688903686 2020-09-25 04:00:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelbJim @obamaisgay69 @AirBossUT Depends on how  you count it, but he lost St. Louis County by 13K votes. That was more in Duluth than the Iron Range, but if he wins MN, it will be partially because he slashes that margin.
1309219691559374848 2020-09-25 03:54:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou This was easily predictable. The fact they are talking about it now either indicates desperation or a pompous level of confidence.
1309217850742243330 2020-09-25 03:47:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @obamaisgay69 @AirBossUT Trump is really going to narrow the gap in the Iron Range, possible win it overall. Together with further driving up rural turnout and potential shy Trump suburban MSP voters makes a pretty wide path for him to take the state.
1309214063935787015 2020-09-25 03:32:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton BTW, of those trifectas, 6/8 had a Senate decided by one vote, including the most recent 2 years. 05-06 was 55-45 and they wasted it on....a botched social security reform attempt!
1309213303676317698 2020-09-25 03:29:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Americans have only given the GOP a trifecta for 8 years (6 in the past 20, though) since the 1930s due solely to scaremongering over social programs. Democrats have gotten it for like 16 years just since since 1952, let alone 1932-52 when they had it for 18/20.
1309208326346092545 2020-09-25 03:09:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @medicjm @RyanGirdusky @nedryun There are ways of finding out that are pretty accurate.
1309207806785060864 2020-09-25 03:07:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @based_coder @RyanGirdusky Dems are underperforming what they want. They're looking for more like 60+ because none of their voters will be showing up election day this year.
1309198032257376257 2020-09-25 02:28:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads People really thought we were exaggerating this stuff for years, but it was all true. All I know is evil thrives in darkness. It dies in the light.
1309196178513424384 2020-09-25 02:21:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Jogger_American @JFedposter @SelimSeesYou I'm not sure if he voted for himself.
1309196088625299459 2020-09-25 02:20:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @HarmlessYardDog Wasn't Ann Coulter into this guy for a while?
1309192831785984006 2020-09-25 02:07:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiahgameking2 I think in a rosy scenario, Trump can get upwards of 71-72 million votes. In a rosy scenario for Biden, he could probably get 75 million. It's possible for both of those to happen. I think an average result is like 66-69 Biden popular vote.
1309189469686444032 2020-09-25 01:54:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed If I remember, he's specifically referring to Western and Central Europe and their settler colonies.
1309187663682056205 2020-09-25 01:47:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Yeah, and these polls are literally all over the map. Trump+2 in Nevada while tied in South Carolina and down 9 in NC is just like: No.
1309186975035994113 2020-09-25 01:44:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I know people who really think Trump is going to get less raw votes than McCain and I just think that's crazy.
1309185840921350147 2020-09-25 01:40:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume True, but I really think suburban voters will come home this time around.
1309185636709142528 2020-09-25 01:39:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Nothing is a coincidence. This is literally what we are fighting.
1309185164665409538 2020-09-25 01:37:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed This is Carl Trueman's most garbage take. The Reformation didn't happen yesterday. Protestantism is the default in many cultures now and has been for over 4 centuries.
1309184691254235139 2020-09-25 01:35:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume WI was a squeaker in both 2000 and 2004. Trump pulled it off by flipping the rurals. It's really a question of if he can do it again. MI was a similar story, but a much tighter race in 2016.
1309183575535898624 2020-09-25 01:31:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Pre-RBG, Dem poll.
1309182523768008711 2020-09-25 01:26:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @EveKeneinan It's all going to be so petty when the day of judgment arrives.
1309182234788757505 2020-09-25 01:25:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 I remember a certain Christine O'Donnell who did this in Delaware. Delaware GOP primary voters have a knack for picking these people.
1309181201257816066 2020-09-25 01:21:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Seriously: We could totally create like a second class state in our system and separate out shitlib centers and the country will be 55-45 Republican and the Democrats will be much more moderate. They can shovel all their immigrants in their dens of communism and it will collapse.
1309180821446811649 2020-09-25 01:20:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think some of you are getting way too excited about Lauren Witzke. Like, she won a primary in an election she has no shot of winning. She isn't the "future of the Republican Party" as much as I want more people like her in the Party.
1309179969021661184 2020-09-25 01:16:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Effectively 0 vs. 0 is a tie.
1309178129961844738 2020-09-25 01:09:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GrowtheFKUP Any divorce would have to require mass population exchanges and more natural borders. Like, some of these countries would be utterly indefensible. The Commie Coast could literally be crushed in a day.
1309177331173462021 2020-09-25 01:06:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy A lot of these divorce maps don't really make much sense. The problem is the modern United States doesn't have enough regional unity in most of these places. Like, what would an independent Florida identify as? The continental retirement home?
1309176267145654272 2020-09-25 01:02:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed And shoving them with Appalachia lmao.
1309175221996449799 2020-09-25 00:57:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Ban public polling.
1309173952598732801 2020-09-25 00:52:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot There's always at least one or two House upsets even in the most boring years. Usually at least one both ways. DeFazio has hung on in a district that doesn't match his politics at all for decades. Time seems ripe for a swing against him tbh.
1309173789033406464 2020-09-25 00:52:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Lots of terrible borders here: Fairfax in Appalachia, saddling "Big Sky" with Portland.
1309173310287118344 2020-09-25 00:50:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Yeah, I'm sure there totally isn't a shy Trump vote in the suburbs with violent rioters roving around assaulting you and your property.
1309167139375513604 2020-09-25 00:25:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theedgeofright @ColumbiaBugle @MeredithMarsha1 A very long future.

1309165815208513541 2020-09-25 00:20:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly He should hole up at Mar-A-Lago, but yes.
1309165546039054339 2020-09-25 00:19:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @revjackashcraft It's one thing to hype up your stuff, but "it's going to change the election" better not be Planned Parenthood saying Planned Parenthood things again.
1309164706029023236 2020-09-25 00:16:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacksonPackson1 @RedEaglePatriot That video of the commie working for him apologizing for Castro really killed him with a lot of Hispanics.
1309164022525296642 2020-09-25 00:13:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot I've lost a lot of faith in these people over the years. They better have Joe Biden on tape with Chinese hookers.
1309163397540466688 2020-09-25 00:10:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Even without the signature requirement or anything really. Like, being able to identify it as elections mail is a literacy test.
1309163275360374784 2020-09-25 00:10:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation They're arguing it's a literacy test, but by the dumb definition of literacy tests from civil rights precedent, filling out a mail-in ballot is itself a literacy test.
1309162307113672704 2020-09-25 00:06:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This smells like...victory!
1309152225000935424 2020-09-24 23:26:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep Every vote counts. Gotta narrow that PV margin.
1309151946876628992 2020-09-24 23:25:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @oblivionrecurs Lots of divorces in Iowa in the post-election civil war.
1309149502918594566 2020-09-24 23:15:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ConservadorOtto @realikamusume I didn't even see that. Yeah, these polls are all over the map. I'd just throw them in the trash. You'd probably get a better poll asking people at a random McDonald's who they're voting for.
1309146680567246854 2020-09-24 23:04:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III Electorate: Reminder, all the people you hate, hate Trump too!
1309145420443070466 2020-09-24 22:59:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @realikamusume 9/1-9/21: The poll could be done by the polling gods and it would be bad.
1309145300016168961 2020-09-24 22:58:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Trump+2 in NV and Biden+9 in NC is ridiculous lol. Yeah, I thought those earlier numbers were garbage, but this confirms it.
1309141579991580681 2020-09-24 22:44:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> We cannot afford another Democrat term, especially now. You think the crackdown is bad now? You think it's hard being a right-winger now? Try it the day after Trump loses the election. We cannot afford negative nellies and petty critics right now.
1309140756276350979 2020-09-24 22:40:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner I'm sick of these naysayers, especially at this late hour. We can't afford a Biden term. We can't afford to be bashing the President and discouraging his voters because he didn't perform a miracle. We can't affirm a Democrat trifecta in Washington again.
1309139798607757314 2020-09-24 22:37:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Liberals: We should respect all countries equally and respect their way of life!  Also liberals: Russia is evil.  These people literally never said this when Moscow was the capital of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
1309137789645185026 2020-09-24 22:29:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume That and Crook County and Dallas vote fraud. There's actually a few elections like this in history where it's difficult to get a precise count.
1309137064831709188 2020-09-24 22:26:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Ranked choice is so dumb. Southern states have been doing actual runoffs for a long time for basically everything but President. That's reasonable.   Also, this will mess with the national popular vote tally (putting a lie to the idea it actually exists).
1309136485673824258 2020-09-24 22:23:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ClassicalTheis There's still time!
1309000916733956098 2020-09-24 13:25:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Convict them before the election so they can’t vote.
1308995442299015175 2020-09-24 13:03:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @imboombing @thehangingchads @CatholicEcon We won’t know that until after the fact really.
1308992079440338944 2020-09-24 12:50:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trueaspenblue He like, bitch, I just think he’s funny.
1308990707399622657 2020-09-24 12:44:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OakenOdyssey Sure
1308990210294927360 2020-09-24 12:42:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OakenOdyssey A lot of the conventional wisdom is that he will pick Haley, but conventional wisdom also said the 2008 Presidential race would be George Allen vs. Hillary Clinton in 2006.
1308989763219795968 2020-09-24 12:40:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OakenOdyssey It really depends. I can easily see a better primary challenger emerging, but I’m not going to get angry if Pence wins and has a decent VP. If he picks Nikki Haley, that will be a massive disappointment.
1308989241435795456 2020-09-24 12:38:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @imboombing @thehangingchads @CatholicEcon The model seems to heavily weight enthusiasm. It’s going to get a lot right because the more enthusiastic supporters nearly always win, but there will be aberrations and coin tosses.
1308988222442217473 2020-09-24 12:34:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OakenOdyssey If Trump wins this year, it’s basically a fait accompli. There might be challengers claiming to be more loyal to the Trump agenda, but Pence will run as Trump’s third term.
1308986444099334151 2020-09-24 12:27:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @imboombing @thehangingchads @CatholicEcon I don’t think that’s the only factor in the model. I remember there being eleven elements to it including basic stuff like the economy.
1308986026334003203 2020-09-24 12:26:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m sure this is really helping Biden in Pinellas County.
1308981535014612992 2020-09-24 12:08:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 @MuricaNumbaOne @mauritaniadan @thehangingchads Good point, but those states are just so tiny that the entire state’s pop is basically located in one metro area. Same could be said of CT, RI, VT, and DE. Perhaps NJ, but you could wrap NYC up with a few counties in North Jersey and kill two birds with one stone.
1308970741149425668 2020-09-24 11:25:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 @imboombing @thehangingchads @CatholicEcon Yeah, that’s the map if Trump actually manages 362 by some miracle.
1308969731081351169 2020-09-24 11:21:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @imboombing @CatholicEcon Yeah, I agree, I’m just wondering how his model works to get that ridiculous result.
1308969509504638984 2020-09-24 11:20:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MuricaNumbaOne @mauritaniadan @thehangingchads Most states are like this. Only California is so bad you’d have to mangle the state to create a GOP stronghold.
1308968163879550977 2020-09-24 11:15:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @imboombing @thehangingchads @CatholicEcon I just want to know how he gets the EVs. I just find the idea of NY flipping while NJ, VA, and CT stay blue kind of ridiculous.
1308967432376156161 2020-09-24 11:12:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III “The future is incel.”  Then the future is pretty short. Opinion dismissed.
1308966081453846534 2020-09-24 11:06:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot If they're tuning into the debates with an even halfway open mind, they're probably not too concerned with elite media opinions.
1308965925350236161 2020-09-24 11:06:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot I just don't think this will make much of a difference. ACB's judicial position is overwhelmingly popular in the public: The public doesn't want judges making law and that's the conservative position and that's ACB's position.
1308962413400780800 2020-09-24 10:52:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I have Virginia and Colorado flipping last. I think Virginia flips before Colorado, but that could go either way.
1308962161167917057 2020-09-24 10:51:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume This is what a 350+ EV victory looks like. It seems a pretty tall order, but it also seems the only way to actually put this to bed without some dumb secession attempts or something crazy.  https://t.co/HxOmHx3uIp
1308960979246514176 2020-09-24 10:46:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly @realikamusume New Mexico would be a nice one to have.
1308960337677504512 2020-09-24 10:43:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingBroly @realikamusume I just don't know how he can pull it off. He'd need to take virtually all of the Gary vote and draw new voters.
1308959941953228803 2020-09-24 10:42:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_Rep00_ @realikamusume The larger the margin the more only the leftists will take to the streets. When I say "peacefully," I basically mean "with relatively full official Democratic acquiescence." There will be riots regardless.

1308958954085584896 2020-09-24 10:38:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume The popular vote win is the only way to potentially have this resolve itself peacefully and for the good of the country.

1308917615205576704 2020-09-24 07:54:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 @oblivionrecurs @TRElections Oh, yeah, that too, but the idea they’re breaking more than Stein voters just kind of puts the lie to it.

1308915264831008768 2020-09-24 07:44:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV Republicans win landslide in 2010, gaining 63 seats: It’s low turnout! Not really Democratic!  Democrats win above average 41 seats in 2018: Proof that we must proceed with impeachment to save democracy.
1308914575211929602 2020-09-24 07:42:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV These people have always lived in an alternate universe and it has only gotten worse over the years. They take every time their guy wins by a few votes as some kind of eternal mandate.
1308912329409671169 2020-09-24 07:33:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @thehangingchads It’s what the Founding Fathers would have wanted.
1308911645180256257 2020-09-24 07:30:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in her first opinion, declares Trump President for Life due to the ongoing national emergency.
1308911139779117058 2020-09-24 07:28:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReactionaryIan Unfortunately on many levels, it looks more and more like like we’re in for a roller coaster.
1308910833662132225 2020-09-24 07:27:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV He’s going to do it.
1308909078299672578 2020-09-24 07:20:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Leftist act like you’re some kind of crazed conspiracy theorist if you show the slightest bit of skepticism about their projects. Really it doesn’t have to demand some lizard-people plot to be skeptical of modern information distribution.
1308907826077728769 2020-09-24 07:15:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I like how lefties will tell you to trust the polls until they all start unskewing unfavorable ones. Maybe we’re all just prone to confirmation bias sometimes? Maybe that’s why all the polls tilt left in the first place?
1308905813411606528 2020-09-24 07:07:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton They’re also becoming Protestant. Some dude named “James Hernandez” will be telling us why we need to respect our Anglo Saxon heritage is 20 years.

1308900468316426242 2020-09-24 06:46:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 Precisely what I was thinking about.
1308891627679866880 2020-09-24 06:10:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation The polls don’t show some massive shift on the issues. If Trump was really this massively unpopular personally, you would see a strong third party challenger with someone like Perot claiming to be the real heir of a legacy.
1308890877247586304 2020-09-24 06:07:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Anderson took votes from Carter. His base was liberal independents.
1308885172352364544 2020-09-24 05:45:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I doubt that will happen if Trump wins the entire rust belt, which I think happens before Virginia.
1308884406300545025 2020-09-24 05:42:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SaveWhitesInZA Fairfax has some population centers that have insanely high Dem turnout rates. Most of the row houses in places you’ll see are still GOP dominated.
1308883371263766533 2020-09-24 05:38:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Two things: Gun control and judicial nominees. NeverTrumpers in Northern Virginia care about that sort of thing and Trump has been really good about it. Gun control could drive down state turnout, while judicial nominees gets him back to Romney levels in NoVA. It's a narrow path.
1308882832698363905 2020-09-24 05:35:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Trump got 28.6% in Fairfax. It's really difficult to go lower.
1308882615668224000 2020-09-24 05:35:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Consider: Trump lost the state by about 1.5 points more than Romney did, while losing more than a net 100K votes from Northern Virginia compared to Romney. This was mostly in raw switches from Romney to Clinton. If Trump can recover those, the state is back in play.
1308882029333934083 2020-09-24 05:32:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I don't think Virginia will really vote Trump, but I honestly do not believe it will go by more than 6 or 7 points to Biden. Democrats have really hit a cap in NoVA in 2016 and I don't see them squeezing any more net votes there. It is possible for the GOP to improve some places.
1308879305045413898 2020-09-24 05:21:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @oblivionrecurs @TRElections Interesting survey. It would be interesting to compare the data from January to now and what trends emerged. I do think the rally effect has finally hit for Trump.
1308877102532489221 2020-09-24 05:13:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @oblivionrecurs @TRElections I'm just not buying the idea Johnson voters break more for Biden than Stein voters.....What's the sample size there? Is it even possible to poll this group nationally? There really aren't that many people in it.
1308876485932048384 2020-09-24 05:10:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @TRElections I think it's possible he will run even as his 2016 totals with the group because it's possible blue state Republicans might still be just as sour on him or perhaps more. However, this will be irrelevant in the states that matter where this mass social pressure doesn't exist.
1308875981696966660 2020-09-24 05:08:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @oblivionrecurs @TRElections This makes far more sense of what it seems like on the ground: The NeverTrump movement is almost totally dead now. It's literally just a grift for the TLP, which I'm convinced might even be a deep fake at this point.
1308875080479498241 2020-09-24 05:05:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NotMyNameWhoU @PlumCat3 @realikamusume I really want a 30-06 in my collection. It's such an underrated round because many see it as "obsolete."
1308874886232801280 2020-09-24 05:04:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TRElections This poll is confirmation bias for me: I've been saying for months the White college vote is going to come home. Like, these people didn't suddenly become BLM leftist open borders advocates suddenly.
1308874514743390213 2020-09-24 05:02:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @busteraxp @TRElections He's obviously winning White college grads in, say, Idaho.
1308874419834585089 2020-09-24 05:02:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @busteraxp @TRElections That's nationally.
1308873950810824705 2020-09-24 05:00:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PlumCat3 @NotMyNameWhoU @realikamusume Part of the reason everyone does it is the arms are so plentiful.
1308868438618705920 2020-09-24 04:38:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV That's what they want: The left is essentially treating cops as second class citizens. They literally advocate holding them to "higher standards" for self defense than you or me. This is worse than anarchism.
1308868216475746306 2020-09-24 04:37:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Kristi Noem &gt; Nikki Haley.   If Pence has to pick a woman in 2024, let's pick this lady.

1308865658361442306 2020-09-24 04:27:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Ford was unique because he had never been elected to either the Presidency or Vice Presidency, so I don't think he counts.
1308865430744858635 2020-09-24 04:26:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NotMyNameWhoU @realikamusume @PlumCat3 Personally, I'll be happy to put a full auto select fire control group in my AR. You should form squads around light machine guns and know a guy with a heavy, though.
1308864878296412168 2020-09-24 04:24:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChickenHalf @DoomerAnimeFan John Anderson was the "NeverReagan" Republican. He was polling double digits most of the race and ended up with 7%. Third parties overall got nearly 10, including the best LP showing before Gary Johnson.
1308864376762437632 2020-09-24 04:22:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If there was some mass exodus from the GOP because people disliked Trump enough to not turn out for him, this would show up in the form of a very significant third party challenger almost certainly.
1308863914202083332 2020-09-24 04:20:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The last time an incumbent President lost reelection without a major third party challenger was 1932.
1308861413151170560 2020-09-24 04:10:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is pre-RGB. Believe people.
1308860521815453700 2020-09-24 04:07:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trueaspenblue The concern with mail in is more about ballot harvesting people who have moved, died, or just stealing someone's ballot and voting for them.
1308859232817733633 2020-09-24 04:02:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @USofAmerichan @PlumCat3 No, an appeal was never heard. Other circuits did issue contrary rulings, but none have reached SCOTUS. There are a lot more gun manufacturers willing to take on this sort of thing, though: Massively helps their profit margin with us gun rights people.
1308858777890889729 2020-09-24 04:00:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StaresInStoic Once every so often they go through a culling. Frustrates our account growth.

1308857958948798473 2020-09-24 03:57:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @USofAmerichan @PlumCat3 The full autos are actually legally easier. The Central District of Illinois already agrees with the argument: NFA was passed as a tax. Now that the machine gun registry is closed, there is no purpose for the registry, therefore post-Hughes machine guns are free and clear.
1308857579318259714 2020-09-24 03:55:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I've lost 4 followers in like 30 minutes.
1308856829041090566 2020-09-24 03:52:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @USofAmerichan @PlumCat3 @realikamusume I'm thinking worst case scenario. Mag caps might be ruled unconstitutional in the next 1-2 years anyway. AWBs a year later. Machine guns as soon as a year after that. The rest of the NFA will be a different challenge and more legally difficult, but that could follow full autos.
1308855156205916163 2020-09-24 03:46:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @squigglefang Here's the thing: The machine gun provision is dead with 6 right-leaning judges at least. The reason the NFA was allowed was because it is technically a tax. The closure of the machine gun registry renders this moot for machine guns. This has never been challenged at SCOTUS.
1308854471506751488 2020-09-24 03:43:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 Oh, yeah, and then we lost Alabama....ugg

1308853507705974784 2020-09-24 03:39:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PlumCat3 @realikamusume When the NFA is ruled unconstitutional in the next decade.  You get a machine gun, you get a machine gun, everyone gets a silenced machine gun!  https://t.co/aelFuBe5v7
1308852248877899777 2020-09-24 03:34:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 The problem in 2017-18 is that Donald Trump really scraped into the White House by the hair on his chinny-chin-chin and the Republicans had 51 Senate seats, 1 of which was Jeff Flake among other terrible people. If Trump wins this time, he should have a bigger mandate.
1308851398025641984 2020-09-24 03:31:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingPhilipIIof2 @trueaspenblue Well, you see, only states get to have militias! And they don't have them anymore, so checkmate gun people, you don't get any anymore.
1308851156202987522 2020-09-24 03:30:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trueaspenblue To lefties, existing and having the wrong opinion is terrorism.
1308850737674440704 2020-09-24 03:28:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 Taxes rates are such an ephemeral thing. Easily changed on a whim. It's harder to enact to massive statutory reforms like immigration.
1308850461907333122 2020-09-24 03:27:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @asiandunce @realikamusume However, the rust belt I do think is trending Republican regardless. Trump's first term policies were directed at helping that region and they have. The second term needs to be about continuing that and pushing back out west to take back those states.
1308849934389719045 2020-09-24 03:25:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @asiandunce @realikamusume I'm not too worried about generation gaps. They always seem to exist, but the conservative-leaning people in younger generations seem to eschew politics for the most part and participate more later. I mean, Nixon lost boomers in 1972 (yes, 1972) and look at their reputation now.
1308849334881071110 2020-09-24 03:22:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 Healthcare is easier to get passed overall, but harder to do right.
1308849228777746439 2020-09-24 03:22:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 The Republicans have not enacted a major piece of legislation worth defending in decades. They need that rallying cry. The American people will see the immigration issue as settled if a major reform is passed and they will see Democrats as threatening.
1308848430081609729 2020-09-24 03:19:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 For the Court, I'm referring to some major cases with favorable rulings. For the other two: Major, favorable legislation. Something that seriously reforms the system in the GOP's favor. So, limited immigration, and end to chain migration, etc. Healthcare is more difficult.
1308847149556338693 2020-09-24 03:14:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer Reminds me of the boomer memes about right wing protests vs left wing protests and all the trash left behind.
1308846192789463043 2020-09-24 03:10:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Just a reminder there were still Clinton+10 polls in PA the eve of the election.
1308843363895042049 2020-09-24 02:59:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Murkowski has never gotten a majority of the vote in Alaska. She's up in 2022. Just let that sink in.
1308842942346526720 2020-09-24 02:57:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @oblivionrecurs If the electorate is more White than this in Florida and Trump only pulls off a two point victory, that means he lost significant ground among White voters. That doesn't bode well in the White rust belt.
1308837399712104450 2020-09-24 02:35:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> GOP gameplan if they win the election and we avoid mass conflict.   1. Supreme Court settlement. 2. Immigration settlement. 3. Healthcare settlement.   This will consolidate gains in the rust belt and put the west back on a slow red trajectory.
1308836315727880192 2020-09-24 02:31:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChancelThreader Fact check: True.
1308835780455002112 2020-09-24 02:29:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @120Lior @Sorbetti4 @lebronisajoke @RedEaglePatriot Yeah, we need those California &amp; New York seats back. FWIW, I think 2016-2018 will end up being the nadir of the GOP in California. Won't be going back in the red column any time soon, but it will be hard for it to get any worse from here on out.
1308835264710795266 2020-09-24 02:26:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Max_Rohtbart @RedEaglePatriot Minnesota is the bluest in a region trending red. Arizona is the reddest in a region trending blue. Depending on how you count Illinois and Texas respectively.
1308833569310203905 2020-09-24 02:20:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume He's on the shortlist if I recall.

1308832180978831360 2020-09-24 02:14:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MarcSpector12 @RedEaglePatriot In order for California to go red again, you'd have to have some serious magic happen. The problem is the sheer number of people they lead by and it only is getting worse. I do think they'll hit a nadir this year, though, if 2016 wasn't a nadir.
1308831597483954177 2020-09-24 02:12:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BritishConserv3 @realikamusume @MarcSpector12 @RedEaglePatriot Illinois' big problem for the GOP is the sheer amount of Crook County vote fraud. It's truly a legend going back decades, if not a century or more.
1308828477106388993 2020-09-24 02:00:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @oblivionrecurs I think that electorate makeup is possible and the Hispanic increase could be largely due to the Cubans coming home for the GOP. If the electorate ends up more White, Trump could win Florida by a Bush 04 margin.
1308827557752696834 2020-09-24 01:56:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @oblivionrecurs People are coming home. Big implications for the map. Biden will denounce court packing in a desperate move to still present himself as a moderate and tame GOP enthusiasm, but it will not avail much. He will have to contest Virginia too. He will prevail there, but narrowly.
1308826443279892482 2020-09-24 01:51:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @oblivionrecurs @NationalistTV Interesting dynamic: BLM town in a Republican State in one of the most deeply Republican region of the country with a moderate to conservative Democrat governor.

Literally meaningless noise in terms of the election this year. Very few of them were in the rust belt that will once again be the center of this race.

The story of the midterms isn’t mass Trump rejection, you’re overconfident just like GOP was going into 2012. The fundamentals on 2016 haven’t changed.

The nation is an extension of the family. To say it’s impossible for it to be Christian is essentially to say you can’t have a a Christian family, but this is absurd.

On abortion (if that makes it to the court), you'd see a gutted Roe v. Wade, but it wouldn't technically be overturned. There are ways to synthesize the Roe holding with an effective ban on abortion.

1308485216827310081 2020-09-23 03:16:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I think Collins is kind of screwed either way here. Maine just isn't a fan of conservative judicial nominees yet. Her prospects go down over this while McSally, Tillis, and potentially Ernst's go up.
1308481333065375745 2020-09-23 03:00:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @anradila17 @ScottMGreer Literally no one seriously wants to pass a law to ban birth control.
1308480103706394626 2020-09-23 02:55:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright The threat alone will be sufficient for all but the diehards. That's why rioting dies the moment the "shoot the looters" order is issued.
1308479517036605441 2020-09-23 02:53:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright The GenXers are with them. It's happening, if Trump wants it too. Literally all he has to do is give the word.
1308479111950675969 2020-09-23 02:51:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SouthernConsDem Yeah, his legal philosophy is very idiosyncratic, but it isn't liberal by any stretch of the imagination. You just have to craft your argument really well and use the right issue to get him to side with you.
1308477934013952000 2020-09-23 02:47:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Loftii @realikamusume I don't like that it says only 1% are new registrants.
1308477431053942785 2020-09-23 02:45:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @chigrl @ChadPergram @LiveSquawk It's his call. Them's the rules.
1308476855054479360 2020-09-23 02:42:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Judicial appointees have been remarkably reliable in hard voting disputes. O'Connor and Kennedy were loyal to the GOP in Bush v. Gore (though, notably, Stevens wasn't, but he had long since joined the liberal camp totally, which Roberts hasn't done).
1308475951660007426 2020-09-23 02:39:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Now that's sexy.
1308471962763755520 2020-09-23 02:23:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis I have the memory of an elephant too. I honestly think people with longer memories tend towards the right, especially these days. So many things that just weren't so are peddled as undeniable facts over the years.
1308470841143963652 2020-09-23 02:18:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis A lot of people don't. It's crazy how little people remember over the years.
1308470315253747714 2020-09-23 02:16:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Around 9/11 there was a targeted campaign of distributing ricin and anthrax to American politicians through the mail. Some of the anthrax ended up infecting postal workers and also some Congressional aides if I recall. Was very scary, people were freaked to touch mailboxes.
1308469176584073216 2020-09-23 02:12:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis I mean, someone literally tried to mail ricin to the President of the United States. That was more than some rando sending a DM.
1308468907469135874 2020-09-23 02:11:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis These leftists always say they're inundated with death threats and they rarely produce the threats and they're almost never serious. Leftists make viable threats that end up prosecuted all the time.
1308466487712153600 2020-09-23 02:01:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer How dare you insult the sacred White Claw!
1308461857120935943 2020-09-23 01:43:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Just in case you have forgotten, God planned from all eternity to end Ruth Bader Ginsburg's life 46 days before the election. Let that sink in.
1308461579831324674 2020-09-23 01:42:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LibertarianBlue @ColumbiaBugle Would even total surrender work? They even call their own White male allies who do everything they ask part of the evil White patriarchal system if they so much as breathe wrong.

1308458603028807681 2020-09-23 01:30:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Arab States are going to be our puppets in 4 years if we reelect Trump. They'll be paying us for all their security through private contracts and thousands of young White American men will come home rich from their time as, effectively, mercenaries.
1308458004552060929 2020-09-23 01:27:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @mccarthywzright @NationalistTV Biden hasn't backed out and it's on the schedule. If he doesn't show at this point, it will look really bad.
1308457424446271490 2020-09-23 01:25:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Why do we think all the Arab states are clamoring to recognize Israel?
1308457158758084608 2020-09-23 01:24:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep Back then people were sane and understand rioting isn't really an acceptable thing to do.
1308455993202937858 2020-09-23 01:19:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep Lolberts love him. I wonder what they think about this.
1308455583859777537 2020-09-23 01:18:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @m_terrence_ @BronzeCullis The thing is, California and Mexico have the most potentially rich agricultural land on the continent, but they lack the water. They have the potential for massive food production, even more massive than now. Food should be really cheap on this continent.
1308455000335679488 2020-09-23 01:15:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @m_terrence_ @BronzeCullis The problem has been the environmentalist movement mostly. They have a large say in the places with the most excess water. Some of /ourguys/ like the enviro movement, but irrigation is a basic function of civilization since Ancient Egypt: we can do this and not harm nature.
1308453714886356997 2020-09-23 01:10:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @m_terrence_ @BronzeCullis California keeps its large reservoirs in higher elevations up north with less evaporation than the rest of the state. Trinity and Shasta lakes have climates that more resemble Oregon than the rest of California. California has also tried to pay Oregon for more water, but no dice.
1308453244352573441 2020-09-23 01:08:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Imagine if Biden never says anything and just doesn't show up. That would lol.  On a more serious note, if Biden doesn't show at this point, the campaign is over.
1308452632038645760 2020-09-23 01:06:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @m_terrence_ @BronzeCullis I don't actually live there anymore lol, but I had a couple recent generations of ancestors that owned farms in California and it's always going to be home.
1308451043420835843 2020-09-23 01:00:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @m_terrence_ @BronzeCullis California's nickname "The Golden State" comes equally from this as the Gold Rush.
1308450885920530432 2020-09-23 00:59:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @m_terrence_ @BronzeCullis California supports natural grass because it isn't an actual desert (well, not mostly and not in LA, Orange, and SD counties), but they die in the summer dry season creating this beautiful golden brown on hillsides that looks ugly in your lawn.
1308449733631934464 2020-09-23 00:55:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @m_terrence_ New ones anyway. There were a lot of them that already existed before their water crisis.
1308449606825541633 2020-09-23 00:54:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @m_terrence_ They are being effectively banned in Arizona or made too expensive to economically keep. LA and Orange counties should copy Maricopa.
1308449110874357760 2020-09-23 00:52:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @m_terrence_ @BronzeCullis Water gets redirected from actually productive purposes in the fertile delta to watering Los Angeles lawns in a sprawling metropolis that exists mostly as an accident of modern technology.
1308448822650195977 2020-09-23 00:51:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @m_terrence_ @BronzeCullis The Imperial Valley is an accident of poor engineering that everyone knew was temporary in nature once the dam was built. Central Valley's farm struggles are nearly entirely due to the terrible anti-farm policies of Sacramento of the past few decades.
1308447604078936065 2020-09-23 00:46:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @m_terrence_ @BronzeCullis The Colorado River doesn't impact the Central Valley at all. Central Valley is struggling since the last drought, but droughts are temporary by nature.
1308447278697517056 2020-09-23 00:45:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Yes, and California agricultural land is controlled by people more like their cousins in Wyoming than the urban areas where the population is. If California attempted to make war against the United States, the agricultural land would fall very quickly.
1308446481259663368 2020-09-23 00:42:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Well, California is actually our most agriculturally productive state with abundant fertile soil and three full growing seasons and Wyoming farmland is actually shit, but that's part of why people in Wyoming are more rugged.
1308446066967293957 2020-09-23 00:40:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @TomBevanRCP Them and Richard Barris have been doing the Lord's work cutting through the garbage assumptions of mainstream pollsters that accumulated in the wake of Obama's 2008 mini-landslide victory.
1308445505576488960 2020-09-23 00:38:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Also, yes, people in Wyoming are 68 times more valuable than people in California because people in Wyoming are more likely to survive the apocalypse.
1308444813549805573 2020-09-23 00:35:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @zattack2016 @realikamusume @CEOofBarron @TRElections I'm confident in AZ. NV has a very strong Democrat machine built up by Harry Reid over the decades and bolstered by Obama and now Sisolak most likely. Harder mountain to climb. I always try to remain optimistic and Trump definitely still has a shot.
1308444480027189248 2020-09-23 00:34:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @zattack2016 @realikamusume @CEOofBarron @TRElections NV and AZ have traditionally had a lot of mail in votes for a variety of reasons anyway. It will impact them less than the rust belt where most of the vote is usually in person on election day.
1308444090858639406 2020-09-23 00:32:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @CEOofBarron @TRElections The ballot signatures go a long way toward preventing ballot harvesting, which is why Dems really hate them.
1308443816744058886 2020-09-23 00:31:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @CEOofBarron @TRElections This is one reason absentee ballots used to favor the GOP before the Dems started ballot harvesting scams in the past couple decades.
1308437448129740801 2020-09-23 00:06:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer I love how the left just can’t take a joke.
1308436475428704256 2020-09-23 00:02:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Trump makes picks based on this kind of stuff. Just meme ACB into being RGB’s mirror image.
1308430513200345088 2020-09-22 23:38:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> When a leftists says that they have had "death threats" against them, I can almost guarantee they're referring to people who say they will defend themselves from their wanton aggression.
1308428049763966979 2020-09-22 23:28:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Does any one else remember when Mitt Romney cracked down on illegal immigrants in Massachusetts as a pre-campaign stunt in 2006?  https://t.co/o96Cv4crJK
1308427683014021121 2020-09-22 23:27:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @realikamusume Romney finally remembers his start in national politics was as the conservative alternative to McCain.  You know, he even started cracking down on illegal in Mass in 2006 during his last year as governor. That's why Ann Coulter liked him (she was gullible).
1308427050089410562 2020-09-22 23:24:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I was actually concerned when you said this.
1308426730537918464 2020-09-22 23:23:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Because some people can't read directions, we have to let unsecured, unsigned ballots count in our highly contentious election. Brilliant.
1308426489499725824 2020-09-22 23:22:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CEOofBarron @SelimSeesYou This means two professors at UPenn are careless or not very smart.
1308423855560589314 2020-09-22 23:12:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky These people just remake history. They'll flat our lie. They'll act like the Republican Party has always supported amnesty and open borders and crap trade deals: It's a lie. They are liars. This was never popular in the conservative movement.
1308423602941943809 2020-09-22 23:11:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky Original NeverTrump argument was that he was an unreliable conservative, not that he had the wrong ideas. Now they say he has the wrong ideas. Wrong on what? They'll argue immigration, or perhaps trade, but most of these people opposed NAFTA, TPP, and mass migration 5 years ago.
1308423231825686530 2020-09-22 23:09:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky Literally all of these people abandoned principles they articulated as late as 2015-16 in order to oppose Trump. And they sit around and call you the coward traitor. Heath was either a liar before, or a liar now. No in between.
1308422679347822593 2020-09-22 23:07:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep Some basic problems with this is separating a government benefit from other government income. How are we going to segment out income from being a state government employee from unemployment benefits, legally? Keep in minds states pay you your unemployment.
1308420823678685186 2020-09-22 23:00:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky That's because nearly all of them live inside the Beltway with a few random suburban strongholds scattered throughout the country.
1308419821923717120 2020-09-22 22:56:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba It really depends on why you are libertarian. If you're just a conservative who mostly wants to be left alone to do conservative things, you quickly realize your dream is a lie. If you're a true ideologue? Might as well be a leftist.
1308418312527806466 2020-09-22 22:50:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JackPosobiec These people are just blatant liars. You can't expect the truth out of them at all.
1308416545312378883 2020-09-22 22:43:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep The way tax law defines "income" is extremely broad and it would be difficult to make it so government benefits were exempt.
1308287587476414465 2020-09-22 14:10:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DavidAFoshee Then he gets to remind everyone that he warned them lmao.
1308284356515913729 2020-09-22 13:57:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> &gt;Trump gets Dems to vote by mail. &gt;20% don’t sign them.  &gt;Trump wins landslide.
1308284080258052096 2020-09-22 13:56:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It’s “disenfranchisement” to make a voter actually sign a ballot that goes out in the mail. These people don’t give one wit about election integrity at all. Just think about what these people are saying and what’s possible to blatantly do with no recourse.
1308280589800226817 2020-09-22 13:42:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Sorbetti4 @SubToPe20882818 @RedEaglePatriot Basically Bush 2000.
1308280374380736513 2020-09-22 13:42:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HueJass0 @RedEaglePatriot Would be funny if Arizona is saved by the old Orange County Conservatives crossing the Colorado.
1308278492677767173 2020-09-22 13:34:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 Trump’s campaign is definitely not taking those gambles. That’s why they’ve setup dedicated offices to drag out every WWC male voter in the rust belt to the polls.
1308278148753010688 2020-09-22 13:33:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 It’s impossible to ascertain poll bias to a full degree. However, what we can note is a pattern and not get black pilled every time some new trash poll comes out with obviously ridiculous results. Also recognize have mostly been used to distract from discussing actual issues.
1308276288159993856 2020-09-22 13:25:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer Immigration restrictionism was unquestionably the conservative position pre-2016 New Hampshire primary.
1308275104380604419 2020-09-22 13:21:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou You just look at all these firms and nearly all of them have a D bias and the ones with an R bias are treated as if they’re some kind of pariah: Filled only with worthless partisan hacks.
1308273867945922565 2020-09-22 13:16:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 I’d bet hard money on there being at least a three point pro-Dem bias in national polling today.
1308273636198035456 2020-09-22 13:15:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 I’m talking even more fundamentally than that: The people collecting the data and reporting it have these problems too and that’s where it’s really tough right now. Polling is a hard business on a good day, but in a day like ours? Almost useless.
1308271891451441154 2020-09-22 13:08:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 You have to remember the people taking the polls are most assuredly, often by their own admission, biased against Trump. They want to see things that way and they don’t seem to ever really question their foundational assumptions on this level.
1308271543299043332 2020-09-22 13:06:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 But it’s one with the only living precedent being in 2008 when Bush was markedly unpopular and the economic crash was widely blamed on Republicans. My reason for doubting the number overall is we’re seeing no real meaty disassembly of this data or why.
1308270947418419201 2020-09-22 13:04:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 Probably. Notable: the data shown is 18-29, not 18-24 or 18-21. 18-21 is likely the lowest subgroup, so below 40%. Really what the race boils down to is if that 47-52 number for 2016 voters is correct. A small shift to Trump there massively changes your calculus.
1308269278517440513 2020-09-22 12:57:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Basically, the only way it could have been better is if more of the public was aware of just what’s at stake right now. If the GOP could have dragged 5 million more people to the polls, the house likely would have been held or marginally lost and the Senate goes +7-8.
1308268824739950592 2020-09-22 12:56:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou It could have been better, but with the way the national media was and without Trump on the ballot, it was impossible. Too many of the potential gains were in marginal swing states.
1308266800883421190 2020-09-22 12:48:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 Impressive. Ok, sit back and think about this, though: You gave them extremely generous assumptions and could barely eek out the required votes. That youth vote 50% turnout is crazy high, not “abysmal” and the margin is likely to be smaller in a Presidential election.
1308263510242099208 2020-09-22 12:35:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I know NeverTrumpers who have come around simply because Trump is willing to fight on the court. The average real conservative Trump opponent did so because he wasn’t a “true conservative,” but he has fought more for their cause and most real people know that.
1308261718666158085 2020-09-22 12:27:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @oblivionrecurs @davidshor @SpecialPuppy1 Like I said: Stupid. I’d bribe these people into voting for a Trumpian GOP, but I honestly don’t think they can get the message.

1308259878717267969 2020-09-22 12:20:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @oblivionrecurs Some people are incredibly stupid I have learned.
1308259554514395136 2020-09-22 12:19:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 Shit, these people can’t even AstroTurf opposition in Alabama. At least in swing states they can find the one guy who is now voting Biden and do a profile on him.
1308259360527843328 2020-09-22 12:18:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 If it was, it would have been tossed out as trash. If enough people in Alabama had flipped to make that poll possible, it would be all over the news “TRUMP SUPPORTERS ABANDON HIM: BURN MAGA HATS IN STREET!”
1308258399218532357 2020-09-22 12:14:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 There are 30.6 million 18-24 year olds in the US. There’s no way they break that much for Biden.
1308257984078925824 2020-09-22 12:13:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 There’s no way this group constitutes 15 million people. 18-21 year olds are notoriously unreliable. Bernie got 13.2 million primary votes and the VAST majority voted for Clinton in the general. California couldn’t even rig CA-25.
1308256472095240194 2020-09-22 12:07:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 That’s what I’m trying to get out: The math is simply impossible. These people don’t exist. There’s no hard evidence outside polling from biased outfits that there’s some massive upswell of anti-Trump rage to elect Joe Biden with nearly 80 million votes.
1308256051955994624 2020-09-22 12:05:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 Like I said: It’s simply not possible using real bodies. There simply aren’t enough Democrats in the United States for this to happen. Not even with the imports they’re bringing in.
1308255531807715331 2020-09-22 12:03:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Some estimates of the electorate have it at 150 million. I’m not sure this is possible. If that happens, that means Democrats would need to somehow come up with 79.5 million votes to win with 53 percent of the vote. Where would 15 million people who didn’t vote Hillary come from?
1308254721170382849 2020-09-22 12:00:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> However, I think given the likely size of the electorate, they will need to win by even more. Well over ten million. I haven’t computed it because I don’t think it’s possible using real live voters.
1308254080649883648 2020-09-22 11:57:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> By my estimation, in order for Dems to match the current RCP average, they will need to outpoll Republicans by at least  9 million votes and get at least 3 million more than Hillary got. This is why I deeply distrust the polls going into this average.
1308252015882108929 2020-09-22 11:49:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 My reason for thinking this is based on what I see as worst case scenarios. The polling average is at or beyond a worst case scenario just in terms of warm bodies going to the polls. Given that Dems are voting by mail and Repubs are voting in person, will have hard data soon.
1308250828336230400 2020-09-22 11:44:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 The priors. Just for background: I’ve worked some on campaigns and accumulated this knowledge over time. Not that you have any reason to believe me, I was very suspicious of Romney’s chances because of similar reasons stated here: There was a very tall mountain to climb.
1308248171496308738 2020-09-22 11:34:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 If we had surveys that were all over the place, then it would be easier to say it’s just the normal data chaos you expect in any attempt to survey a popular as large and diverse as the United States. But we don’t, they’re all skewed heavily.
1308247741861109760 2020-09-22 11:32:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 Here’s the thing: What I’m inferring from the data presented is that it’s consistently skewed in one direction. I don’t trust that direction and I trust them less today than I did 4 years ago. Essentially, the polling data is meaningless, because falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus.
1308247004271841281 2020-09-22 11:29:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 Given that Romney&gt;Other voters prefer Trump, there’s simply no way this is possible, even if Trump loses, mathematically he is going to lose by 4%, unless even traditional Republican voters turn against him en masse.
1308246532098084871 2020-09-22 11:27:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 So, if Biden wins by 7 and Trump gets like 63 million votes? He needs to win the equivalent of every single non-Trump voter from 2016. This is why the polling average makes no sense: There’s no way Biden wins by 7 in an average result. There just aren’t enough warm bodies.
1308245942529855489 2020-09-22 11:25:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 I mention 2008 because it’s kind of a worst case scenario for the GOP. I don’t see Trump getting fewer votes than McCain even in the worst case. Hillary got 65.8 million. In order for Biden would need to get 4 million more votes than Hillary just to run even with 2008.
1308244169060646912 2020-09-22 11:18:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 That one shows him at 94. I like to think in terms of raw vote totals, which is harder, but does give some perspective at the actual warm bodies that have to show up somehow. Trump got 63 million votes last time. McCain got 59 million. Obama got 69 million in 2008.
1308241997040365572 2020-09-22 11:09:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 Seems the latest round of polling has him down more among indies than the last round did, but with similar top line results.
1308240921717288960 2020-09-22 11:05:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 I see Marist has him down 20 with Indies actually, which is just lol.
1308239983304638469 2020-09-22 11:01:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 I have not seen a poll that hasn’t had him up with indies nationally to be honest. IBD has him +4 today.
1308239658346741760 2020-09-22 11:00:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There’s simply no way Trump loses the Popular vote by more than 5 while winning Independents unless Democrat turnout is legendary, Republican turnout collapses, or some combo thereof.
1308238776334979079 2020-09-22 10:56:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Right now, Trump is leading Indies. With the same electoral composition as 2018, everything else staying equal, and Trump wins Indies by 6 points, he’s within 2 of Biden. This really doesn’t seem like dumb poll unskewing from 2012. There’s no way these poll internals match Exits.
1308237830674669568 2020-09-22 10:52:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Actually, I lied, did the math wrong, with Trump winning Indies by 6, he’s losing 47.5-49.5 or so. He honestly COULD have won the 2018 electorate with the same party affiliation.
1308237250040397824 2020-09-22 10:50:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I note independent-ID’d people broke Dem 54-42 in 2018. They’re breaking for Trump by 5-10. Giving Trump a 6 point lead with the same party ID as 2018 he loses 47-51 in the PV to Biden. 2018 wasn’t the insane disaster people think.
1308235324137578497 2020-09-22 10:43:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Traditionally, something like 80% of registered voters vote in Presidential election. Means registrations matter more than an off year cycle.
1308234935321362433 2020-09-22 10:41:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou 2018, keep in mind, GOP had crazy retirements: 39. GOP got 50.9 million votes, more than 6 million more than their previous record. This was overshadowed by a truly crazy Dem turnout at 60.6. With higher turnout, registrations matter more.
1308230009723781120 2020-09-22 10:21:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I do think there are potentially millions more GOP votes, though. Harder for them to draw out their voters due to innate right wing pessimism and added pessimism from Obama years.
1308229440850231296 2020-09-22 10:19:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou 53-45 after 8 years of Bush, McCain promising more of the same, and a crashed economy two months before. Republicans have had a hard time breaking out of that 60-63 million vote mark, though.
1308227134335397889 2020-09-22 10:10:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @KevinAldrich2 @realikamusume @SelimSeesYou Wyo &amp; Ming Ut &amp; Ah.
1308224327242874880 2020-09-22 09:59:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @CatrionaMDW @SirDowden She didn’t say that. She also cleared death sentences to start, which was the issue she has been taken out of context on.
1308183021728731141 2020-09-22 07:15:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CatrionaMDW @HeritageNLegacy @SirDowden I like Rushing. In fact, she’s my favorite overall. However, ACB’s origins list creds are very strong and the attacks on her very weak.
1308181066793005056 2020-09-22 07:07:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Dems are really excited to get out and vote this year!  Also this:
1308180331812528129 2020-09-22 07:04:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Brunch is not something Catholics understand because it’s a White Protestant privilege.
1308179467421077510 2020-09-22 07:01:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This person’s opinions are the law of the land. That isn’t ok.
1308179030013890561 2020-09-22 06:59:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Someone tell this woman who is President.
1308178434871439367 2020-09-22 06:56:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @SirDowden That is far from her only appeal. By all outward appearances, she's the strongest originalist on the shortlist.
1308177912529592320 2020-09-22 06:54:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HornetTamer @SelimSeesYou This. Bush interventionist policies were terrible, but we cannot go back to 1939 style isolationist American politics. The US totally ceding ground globally will only create a power vacuum our enemies will take great advantage of.
1308175594505596935 2020-09-22 06:45:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot They probably think Alabama is in play now. Dummies all.
1308175415035539464 2020-09-22 06:44:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @realikamusume This crap gets fast tracked.
1308165869697208324 2020-09-22 06:07:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou All indications are that Kavanaugh helped the GOP in 2018. With the environment then compared to now, I’m not sure how it hurts the GOP. Even ACB. Evangelicals are the only big voting group that care about Court. Leftists are a slim group of people in the actual electorate.
1308163392016986116 2020-09-22 05:57:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Oh, yeah, definitely. I’m just saying the legal argument that what they did was wrong is essentially an enactment of an ex post facto law.
1308162471815979009 2020-09-22 05:53:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Even if you oppose no knock raids (I think they’re overused, but that’s a hard problem to solve), you can’t make them illegal ex post facto.
1308161652177633281 2020-09-22 05:50:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Oh, yeah, I’ve known people like this. All these lib NGOs and domestic nonprofits (my actual experience) are staffed with true believers and headed mostly by greedy people of a certain class.
1308160149555744769 2020-09-22 05:44:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV Just a reminder this is the best they got.
1308159809984909312 2020-09-22 05:42:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads It’s remarkable how cheap decent talent is and how easy it is to fool them about what they’re working on.
1308158912647114753 2020-09-22 05:39:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @alt_hudson @SelimSeesYou Florida seems almost in the bag to me.
1308158797165322245 2020-09-22 05:38:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The polls were awful in 2018 too: They just hit the national generic ballot.
1308157851236536321 2020-09-22 05:35:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CitadelMark Religion is clearly fundamental to how normal people function.
1308147228465397766 2020-09-22 04:52:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PerfInjust Hey, you can’t do that, making laws is basically fascism.
1308145898279645184 2020-09-22 04:47:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> OK, whoever put this together has my gratitude.
1308145478249459715 2020-09-22 04:46:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They're ramming this through and it's going to be beautiful.
1308142963223130120 2020-09-22 04:36:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KAGsquatch @davidchapman141 If they cover his campaign fairly from the beginning and the “NeverTrump” movement among elite Repubs never happens? 60-40 is possible.
1308142790006763520 2020-09-22 04:35:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KAGsquatch @davidchapman141 It’s such a long term hypothetical it’s difficult to know. If we put the point of departure after the 2016 election (let’s say they admit defeat and cover somewhat fairly thereafter), I think we’re looking at 55-45 or so. 40 states.
1308127080765419520 2020-09-22 03:32:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CTrefugees @trueaspenblue Believing the Bible can never be wrong in any circumstance whatsoever.
1308126525179428867 2020-09-22 03:30:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CassandraRules This is “reason” now: “She supports the wrong side, so must be discounted!” No dispute of the actual factual matter.
1308125362191323137 2020-09-22 03:26:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PaleoEconomist @SpringToad Reason and apologetics are effective tools for conforming the mind to truths revealed in the word once you've already accepted the fundamental truths of the Faith. They also reveal the world's wisdom to actually be foolishness.
1308122907164454913 2020-09-22 03:16:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FlycatcherSilky @ScottMGreer I mean, if she just "remember to vote" it would just be bog standard garbage. "Making a voting plan" makes it sound like there's some kind of great inconvenience or complication to voting.
1308113697110360065 2020-09-22 02:39:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer "Make a voting plan..."   These people act like this is some kind of intense mystery.
1308097389048332289 2020-09-22 01:34:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Proving voters are real people that actually exist is basically Nazism.
1308096599319613441 2020-09-22 01:31:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Just your daily reminder that the only way the left ever wins is by manipulating conservatives to buy their garbage.
1308093191019692034 2020-09-22 01:18:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton Maybe they'll actually need to honestly win an election every once in a while now.
1308091545355202560 2020-09-22 01:11:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @llano_queipo The Mississippi poll is pretty typical. It's difficult to gauge the proportion of landslides sometimes.
1308085323256168450 2020-09-22 00:46:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Maybe we can one day put to rest the notion it was ever a ten point race in Pennsylvania in 2016.
1308082002554433536 2020-09-22 00:33:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Looks like you have to add about 10-15 points to the Republican if Alabama is any indication.
1308081680427757572 2020-09-22 00:32:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot How can you trust a group of polls that has Trump running equal in Florida and Texas? Like, just dumb.
1308071700626628610 2020-09-21 23:52:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @YellowLantern19 @ScottMGreer Like I said: They were biased. Always have been. However, they weren’t the blatant liars they are today.
1308069538194493441 2020-09-21 23:44:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly Women know we’re going to win and they’re looking for a mate on the winning side.
1308069195687526405 2020-09-21 23:42:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer It’s pretty amazing how the “fact checkers” went from biased to blatant liars over the course of a decade.
1308065336344948739 2020-09-21 23:27:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep Yeah, Ben Sasse has been reliable on Judicial votes.
1308064452835766273 2020-09-21 23:24:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer Just have to elect Biden and they will stop threatening you for disagreeing with them!
1308060834451656705 2020-09-21 23:09:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I'm convinced the Kavanaugh confirmation saved the Senate.

1308054243878858752 2020-09-21 22:43:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @softsuthernwind Sir, we've been waiting for this opportunity for 155 years.
1308049404537036800 2020-09-21 22:24:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Americans have always had a unique pride in our economy due to the fact America drove world innovation for much of the past 150+ years: Being innovative is certainly nothing to be ashamed of. However, this is no longer pride in innovation.
1308036253598834688 2020-09-21 21:31:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @loucheprophet @LueYee The13th Amendment renders that moot.
1307897146633486336 2020-09-21 12:19:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 She seems to imply she herself would do so, but that doesn’t appear to hinder her reasoning as an appellate judge.
1307896885508812800 2020-09-21 12:18:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 Yeah, they extremely misrepresented what she said. She was addressing a hypothetical about actually issuing the sentence and she said that you should recuse if you can’t apply it in good conscience, which is the correct answer in terms of professional ethics.
1307895487840825344 2020-09-21 12:12:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 This isn’t what she said and she cleared federal executions to start again just this year.
1307894442767118336 2020-09-21 12:08:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Going to a Trump rally is like going to a big party or a football game. Romney? No one had that much fun.
1307886715563053062 2020-09-21 11:37:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried She cleared executions to start herself earlier this year. You’re clearly taking her out of context, misunderstand the conservative legal movement entirely, and don’t like her for political reasons more than anything.
1307885860197675008 2020-09-21 11:34:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks I guess we’re a monarchy now. Trump is Emperor. God save the Emperor.
1307884808136208384 2020-09-21 11:30:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried She’s a principled judge, not a politician. You clearly don’t understand what the conservative legal movement thinks their role is.
1307884625923117057 2020-09-21 11:29:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So, followers, how does this make you feel about ACB?   She applies the law, not what she imagines she wants it to be.
1307884395550867457 2020-09-21 11:28:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried She’s correct. The law is the law even if you don’t like it.
1307884192999649280 2020-09-21 11:27:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried That’s about right for party registration in North Carolina.
1307883037204647938 2020-09-21 11:23:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried The entire idea behind the conservative legal movement is judges don’t set policy. They apply immigration law, not determine what it should be.
1307882786808893440 2020-09-21 11:22:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried The conservative legal movement isn’t about any of this. It’s about properly interpreting the Constitutional powers of government. The Federal government definitely has the power to set pragmatic, nationalistic trade and immigration policies.
1307879320602513413 2020-09-21 11:08:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Mi__General There is absolutely no way they’re capable of making fun of BLM in any capacity right now.
1307877774938509314 2020-09-21 11:02:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @softsuthernwind Will really depend if open conflict occurs. If this is just low level violence until we solve are differences: Own theater. If Trump calls for Volunteers in December? Bleeding Kansas (Starting at Ferguson in 2014).
1307876346417352705 2020-09-21 10:56:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky Dems spent 8 years railroading political norms under Obama. Republicans responded in kind with Trump. Why change now?
1307875938076688385 2020-09-21 10:54:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat Russell Kirk is highly underrated.
1307872328701956098 2020-09-21 10:40:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @SelimSeesYou Nationalists kind of are the main party there. Le Pen is running around 40-45. That should be enough, if translated to legislative votes, to become the official opposition. Personally, I’d probably closer to a right wing Republicans member, but is what it is I suppose.
1307870252206895105 2020-09-21 10:32:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I don’t think she’ll win next election (things can change), but the next election there will determine if the FN is a permanent force there. They need to get significant parliamentary representation.
1307863785642831872 2020-09-21 10:06:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried They have the votes. She’s getting through if nominated and no one will care.
1307863316581224448 2020-09-21 10:04:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @EsquireTargary1 @realikamusume PA was on the Bush map.
1307859866208395264 2020-09-21 09:51:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PerfInjust Why can’t we just say these people are disobedient, often violently and willfully, to God and His law? They’re unbelievers, of course they’ll be offended. How can this guy even call himself a Calvinist?
1307857293023891458 2020-09-21 09:40:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChancelThreader I mean Answers in Genesis uses this type of thing to explain how we get all the species on the Ark.
1307847666982846465 2020-09-21 09:02:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 Yeah, the case made a lot of random statements, but the actual holding was that it was a tax, and so therefore constitutional on that basis. Case was US v. Miller.
1307846703073165314 2020-09-21 08:58:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @corey_gman @Vaiv71738794 @NationalistTV They sent the New York one back down because New York repealed the law in question, so it was moot. No major ones have been rejected to my knowledge. California’s mag cap is what’s likely to make it.
1307843461777887234 2020-09-21 08:45:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 People don’t even know the entire reason the NFA was allowed by SCOTUS in the first place is that it’s a tax. The law has gotten better about overly burdening lawful activities through taxation. A district court in the 90s ruled the machine gun provision unenforceable.
1307841761180618754 2020-09-21 08:39:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 State mag caps and AWBs are going to get to SCOTUS and so much rage will ensue when they say “yeah, no, you can’t do that.”
1307841477205258244 2020-09-21 08:38:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 It was 5-4 with Roberts on the right side. Even if we get another Roberts, gun rights is ours. I’m convinced the NFA is going to get gutted.
1307840624104800257 2020-09-21 08:34:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Does everyone just forget Heller?
1307840493447974912 2020-09-21 08:34:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @reformedindixie I would highly adviser everyone avoid seeking psychiatric treatment for spiritual problems. Don't trust those goons with your soul. Clinical depression? Yes. Spiritual confusion? No.
1307839615764697092 2020-09-21 08:30:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Vaiv71738794 @NationalistTV He counts for gun rights and a lot of gun rights cases are going to make it to the court in the next decade. His infamous tax reasoning in the Obamacare case can be used AGAINST the National Firearms Act too.
1307838139801702400 2020-09-21 08:24:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Vaiv71738794 @NationalistTV I mean, 82 isn't an unreasonable age. It's really what he feels like doing. If he wants to just enjoy life, that's what he'll do. RBG was just a bitter hag who wanted the first woman President to appoint her replacement. God rewarded her greed.
1307837329588051969 2020-09-21 08:21:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV He might retire. Also, Sotomayor is younger, but not in great health.
1307830359510392832 2020-09-21 07:53:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think some of these SCOTUS picks are getting an undeserved bad rep based on one or two random statements taken out of context, but it's good this is mainstream convo now. I remember how hard it was to prevent Harriett Myers from getting on the court under Bush.
1307827601772294144 2020-09-21 07:42:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I mean, it is constitutional to seek the advice of the Senate. Literally how it's supposed to go.
1307822383991009280 2020-09-21 07:22:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation I'm a very religious person and that's incredibly important to me, but when it comes to women I almost consider their political affiliation before that because of how heated it is now. If they're some kind of hardcore leftie or NeverTrumper, I don't bother. Too much risk.
1307817943443615746 2020-09-21 07:04:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Americafirstpa6 @RedEaglePatriot Well, that's true, but I've never seen it done this much and it's not like Democrats are new to the lying business.
1307817338822066176 2020-09-21 07:02:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot What is up with this guy and the ridiculously huge numbers? Is that a symptom of dementia?
1307817078586515456 2020-09-21 07:01:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DefaultAccoun17 My bio clearly gives my location outside the UK....  FWIW as an American with a keen interest in British politics, I've always seen Johnson as a means to an end in getting a tolerable Brexit (if not, if God wills, no deal).  https://t.co/4LN1mQPJFy
1307812866712625152 2020-09-21 06:44:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat They basically just want to outlaw Christianity.
1307812195275857924 2020-09-21 06:41:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DefaultAccoun17 People say this stuff, but that was supposed to be the case in 2016 too.
1307812029403738114 2020-09-21 06:41:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried This idea she wouldn't enforce the death penalty is just a lie and you're better than it. She helped clear federal executions to start back up earlier this year.
1307809844754370565 2020-09-21 06:32:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This puts Joe Biden basically right at what Hillary got in 2016. Seems right. I think Trump soaks up some more of that Jorgenson, undecided, and other vote and eeks out a one point win again.
1307808702787878912 2020-09-21 06:27:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot You think only 5? I hope it's wider, tbh.
1307808136468852736 2020-09-21 06:25:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theoldright @RedEaglePatriot That is based on her appellate judge role. Even ACB would uphold Roe in her current role.
1307806436345475072 2020-09-21 06:18:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theoldright @RedEaglePatriot Kushner’s motives are likely electoral and whoever the pick ends up being will have been pushed hard by the Federalists.
1307803401493909504 2020-09-21 06:06:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @theoldright @RedEaglePatriot Why?
1307801992706895872 2020-09-21 06:01:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sillysailor5 @Barnes_Law It's a category the progs have invented to pretend like some precedents are more equal than others. There's some sense that some landmark cases mean more for the law than others and this should be taken into consideration, but it doesn't make it anymore binding.
1307800230486736902 2020-09-21 05:54:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks @quintfilius Can never trust them, correct, but there's a reason there's a subculture in the Bay Area of people like Curtis Yarvin. It's because they got left behind in the post-Cold War tech world.
1307799074113048583 2020-09-21 05:49:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LarrySchweikart @CottoGottfried Yeah, I don't think this will cause any problems for Trump in the Rust Belt and might excite some Evangelicals in places like Grand Rapids who were otherwise reticent (these people exist, unfortunately).
1307798027978133505 2020-09-21 05:45:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks @quintfilius The CIA built Silicon Valley to fight commies. Now that the CIA has transitioned from "lead anti-communist force" to "lead Big Gay force," well, this happened.
1307797657910472704 2020-09-21 05:43:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @quintfilius It wasn't always this way. Rather rapidly old school White-bread tech geeks got overtaken by a culture of Indian H1bs. At the same time that was happening, millennials raised on the Internet and joining tech were very left-wing for a variety of reasons.
1307796146656509954 2020-09-21 05:37:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Looks like Oracle is the company to work for if you’re a software engineer. This matches personal experience: Oracle folks seem very professional in the White-bread sense of the term.
1307795452520280064 2020-09-21 05:35:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @RedEaglePatriot Basically. Congregational culture could play a role here too. Problem with this is it’s a lot of effort and still some guesswork involved. Only other thing I can think red pill life events like Kenneth K. Lee: Rooftop Korean, Appellate Judge, but that’s an incredibly slim group.
1307794263527297024 2020-09-21 05:30:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cg9oyg4 @JCompson_III Good point.
1307794121814351872 2020-09-21 05:29:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @RedEaglePatriot Alito has been that (he was seen as more moderate than Roberts when nominated). We really don’t know how Kavanaugh will turn out yet. I’m not really sure what a good sniff test for this is besides possibly what Church they attend (not denomination, but if the Church is based).
1307792583993831424 2020-09-21 05:23:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot I’m happy with any of the picks. Most of these inferences about their positions on particular issues are inferences anyway. Like, you never know until they’re on the Court what they really think about anything.
1307792180791201799 2020-09-21 05:22:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot @CottoGottfried As long as Biden is below 50, it’s up for grabs.
1307791963991797764 2020-09-21 05:21:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Left doesn’t need to play divide and conquer on the right. We do it to ourselves with the slightest transgression. This is waning, thankfully, but it still crops up in dumb Twitter battles.
1307791319385939972 2020-09-21 05:18:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III This isn’t even what people ever meant by small government anyway. Shooting criminals is the most basic function of government. Opposing that is anarchism, nothing more or less.
1307789240919621633 2020-09-21 05:10:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks @ComradeDoyIe Then dryly say “no pun intended.” Conservatives are too serious for puns.
1307787998361075712 2020-09-21 05:05:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ComradeDoyIe Conservatism is literally just liberalism from 6 months ago. ACAB.
1307787579148963840 2020-09-21 05:03:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp BTW, if the California assault weapons ban ends up overturned (I think it will), someone needs to go straight after the NFA. I think the machine gun provision in particular is vulnerable. A court in the early 90s already ruled enforcement unconstitutional.
1307784692989657092 2020-09-21 04:52:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp It’s absolutely ridiculous Dems thing late term abortion is a constitutional right, but God forbid someone own a semi-auto rifle with a 20 round capacity.
1307784325400756224 2020-09-21 04:50:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I don’t know much about Lagoa, but even ACB would say this and she’s far from an abortion apologist.
1307784078129856514 2020-09-21 04:49:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is true FOR APPELLATE JUDGES. Note that she says Supreme Court precedent for lower courts. This is all true.
1307778000256208898 2020-09-21 04:25:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Yeah, I don’t think we have anything to lose by just jamming it through.
1307777748690231302 2020-09-21 04:24:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TuckerSaglio @Goodtweet_man “This can’t happen in other countries!”  &gt;Trudeau gets a minority government after losing the popular vote.  “Well, I guess that’s ok.”
1307777478660890624 2020-09-21 04:23:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tsrblke @Goodtweet_man @varadmehta These people conveniently ignore that countries with popular votes to elect a strong president tend to do so through runoffs.
1307774784487534592 2020-09-21 04:13:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp I think it was, in many cases, literal bar fights.
1307766747949404167 2020-09-21 03:41:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill An Assad supporter who destroyed Harris’s campaign.
1307766051514576899 2020-09-21 03:38:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SouthernConsDem @NikkiHaleyfan @DubyaShill I’m actually enjoying this because it is far more reasonable than 99% of Twitter convos.
1307765777798500355 2020-09-21 03:37:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill Like I said Kamala Harris: Part Deux. Some GOP equivalent of Gabbard will go up there and just wreck her whole campaign in about two minutes.
1307765586668277760 2020-09-21 03:36:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill Because if she didn’t she wouldn’t go anywhere. It will ring incredibly hollow the moment she’s subject to cross examination.
1307765208702750721 2020-09-21 03:34:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill Imposing one extra tariff than you would doesn’t mean he transgressed some great principle.
1307765096568020992 2020-09-21 03:34:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill I’m aware. That’s why I find it silly that many of you think it’s some kind of point of dogma that Trump can’t be more aggressive with them to get better trade deals.
1307764610414645248 2020-09-21 03:32:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill “More than you give him credit for.”   He was willing to use tariffs when it suited him, which cuts to the heart of actual conservatism: We govern on principle, not ideology. There are few hard and fast rules when exercising lawful political power.
1307762026551422976 2020-09-21 03:22:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill I’m not an “economic leftie” nor am I even a “populist” or “nationalist” in an ideological sense. Protectionism is not a leftist position and is, indeed, the original position of the Republican Party. Even Reagan was more protectionist than you would give him credit for.
1307760924950921217 2020-09-21 03:17:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill I don’t think he really fit the definition of a neocon, though. He was operating in a fundamentally different context than the Old Right was.
1307760536059342850 2020-09-21 03:16:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill Why do you think I care what Reagan’s opinion was about anything? He was a good President, not some Prophet of right wing philosophy.
1307757148412301314 2020-09-21 03:02:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill That isn’t what neoconservatism is: Neoconservatism is ex-communists who switched over to “the right” because they came to believe the proper historical end stage was capitalist democracy. This isn’t “conservatism” at all or even right wing.
1307756812653998080 2020-09-21 03:01:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Simplicissimu16 That’s what I said: We’re not an Imperial people. Americans are always up for a good fight, though. They just don’t like the aftermath.
1307755771929808897 2020-09-21 02:57:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill That’s because the old American right saw isolationism as the best means of maintaining American power, not because they liked having a weak America. You believe too much of your own propaganda.
1307754794132615169 2020-09-21 02:53:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill Why on earth would preserving a nation’s power need a “neo” prefix? Conservatives have supported that since literally forever.
1307753746773012481 2020-09-21 02:49:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill Yes, it really is. Have you not read any Irving Kristol? He’s very explicit about what he wants the US to use power for, and it’s not realpolitik. Realpolitik is not neoconservatism: It’s just conservatism.
1307752951327395841 2020-09-21 02:46:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Americans are a bellicose people, but they are not an Imperial people.
1307752699044208645 2020-09-21 02:45:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill I didn’t say he wasn’t an interventionist. He’s just not a nation-building fool who will bog down thousands of our men in a fruitless attempt to impose western democracy on a bunch of savages.
1307744687751655424 2020-09-21 02:13:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill He says that. But he won’t actually commit actual resources to actually accomplish that. Talk is cheap and no one wants to be seen as propping up some two bit dictator. But he would do just that if it was to our benefit.
1307743636633911296 2020-09-21 02:09:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill Are any of those in the pursuit of something like what Bush attempted in Iraq or Afghanistan? No, they’re to advance very specific policy objectives without long term commitments. He isn’t Ron Paul, but he’s not Bush either.
1307741552236691456 2020-09-21 02:00:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill Any other GOP President would have jumped at Syria. Trump’s view on war is much closer to the base’s than Bush’s was: Get in, accomplish a defined objective, and leave. None of this nation building, democracy spreading futility.
1307740640025997313 2020-09-21 01:57:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill You don’t know that. He has changed his tune a lot being number two to Trump.
1307740199426961408 2020-09-21 01:55:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill Keep dreaming. It isn’t happening. Trump has a better chance of denomination than that. I’d bet on Cruz personally.
1307739986440134659 2020-09-21 01:54:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill That doesn’t mean they’ll vote for her in a primary for President. The party base chose in spite of incredible machine maneuvering to back Trump. The base isn’t where you think they are. Pence will not run as a free trade, pro-was candidate. He would lose if he did.
1307739253976248320 2020-09-21 01:51:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Media is going to try to meme Nikki Haley to death. She’ll get tons of cash. They’ll try to sell us that she’s an “up and comer.” Don’t believe it. She’ll falter the moment she has any questions thrown her way.
1307738951134961664 2020-09-21 01:50:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill Nikki Haley is the Kamala Harris of the Republican Party. Same energy.
1307738572427063297 2020-09-21 01:49:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill “Most likely.” No. Like, this woman is a media meme candidate. She has little pull with actual GOP voters. Pence will run as Trump’s third term, and his greatest challenge in the primary will be trying to prove that.
1307737777535176708 2020-09-21 01:45:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill The primaries. People like Rubio are remarkably unpopular in their own party and there’s no indication their wing will recover. Just look who’s in the running in 2024. If Trump wins, you got no shot. And that’s good, because you suck and make terrible policies.
1307736710894301184 2020-09-21 01:41:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem @DubyaShill You lost. Get over it.
1307734781526970370 2020-09-21 01:34:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @guru_scout @RedEaglePatriot Awash. It isn’t really an issue among low propensity voters in the state.
1307734133079191554 2020-09-21 01:31:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @AStratelates I do think this is one reason why Anglicanism in particular has become more identified with liberalism than other Protestant denominations. Anglicanism isn’t anymore infected with it than Presbyterians are, but Anglican identity took a massive hit with the Tractarians.
1307733623207010309 2020-09-21 01:29:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @AStratelates This is what we Reformed (even Reformed Catholic) Anglicans have been saying since Newman penned Tract 90.  https://t.co/038TwP6seq
1307733343723810818 2020-09-21 01:28:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Simplicissimu16 @AStratelates @BronzeCullis There are different types of High Anglicans, even ACs. A lot of ACs are formally committed to Protestant dogmas like Sola Scriptura. They aren’t just Roman Catholics sans Pope.
1307732581044150274 2020-09-21 01:25:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @AStratelates It’s almost a reverse correlation.
1307732374642397184 2020-09-21 01:24:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @BronzeCullis The Continuum doesn’t contain most ACs.
1307731440856166400 2020-09-21 01:20:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @BronzeCullis Most ACs are liberal to some extent even if they aren’t completely insane.
1307730299485290496 2020-09-21 01:16:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis I think he is more beloved among Anglo-Catholics than actual TradCats.
1307728807512674306 2020-09-21 01:10:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Know what I can’t stand? When Protestants talk about needing a “theology of the body.”
1307725725718450178 2020-09-21 00:58:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Quite literally: They’re the original liberals.
1307724935637405696 2020-09-21 00:54:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @EvenWokerPresby I’m thankful these people have revealed themselves to be the cold hearted cowards they are. No spirit here at all.
1307666483699486720 2020-09-20 21:02:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailduster6bt @realikamusume Yeah, I don’t know enough about the Hispanic woman.
1307665879358898176 2020-09-20 21:00:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailduster6bt @realikamusume No, the Roof Korean. Mike Lee’s brother’s name is Thomas Rex, I believe.
1307665214754697216 2020-09-20 20:57:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @trailduster6bt @realikamusume I’d love Kenneth K. Lee. Too bad St. Benitez is too old.
1307661036963667971 2020-09-20 20:41:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba It’s crazy to think that mid 2000s MSNBC seems tame compared to this crap. They’d launch abortion scares from time to time, but birth control? Sterilization? What?
1307660548243361794 2020-09-20 20:39:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba I really don’t get how they believe these delusions. I think the Internet has just gotten all the left wing conspiracy quacks a lot more power. They didn’t use this type of ammo back in the legacy media days.
1307659892526927873 2020-09-20 20:36:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @SChristum The more interesting page’s would be, well, more interesting. However, there’s a lot of hay to get to that needle.
1307659005922283520 2020-09-20 20:32:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SChristum @BronzeCullis I’m going to sleep just thinking about that.
1307644906664595457 2020-09-20 19:36:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou If you change this to the last 10, it’s 4/10: Hardly the landslide he’s making it out to be. And the Republicans were the last to win a double digit popular vote landslide. No Clinton has ever gotten a majority either despite winning the popular vote.
1307550841587601408 2020-09-20 13:23:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @SirDowden So they did Redistrict, but who knows how it will play out.

1307549599717109761 2020-09-20 13:18:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @SelimSeesYou North Carolina might have had to redraw their maps.
1307548813914238976 2020-09-20 13:15:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Imagine actually drinking the Kool Aid this much.
1307548426993913864 2020-09-20 13:13:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried “Stealing.” Ok.
1307547672702783488 2020-09-20 13:10:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba I was a gifted kid and know where he’s coming from. I’m more successful than most on this corner of Twitter, but it’s hard. The system has really screwed over people like us.
1307542191196254213 2020-09-20 12:48:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried We can get too confident based on this type of stuff. These are the places the battle is and everyone knows it.
1307541374649106433 2020-09-20 12:45:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @SirDowden I just don’t see how the GOP could sink lower than 2018 unless the Dems win a landslide of 2008 proportions nationally. That still seems unlikely given the dynamics of Trump opposition.
1307540114839687168 2020-09-20 12:40:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The 2018 midterms had a record high Democrat turnout with around 61 million votes. In that milieu, 45% still approved of Trump. Does any one really doubt his voters will be more motivated to get to the polls? No.
1307538045084807168 2020-09-20 12:32:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Murica baby.
1307537649197109250 2020-09-20 12:30:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @SelimSeesYou They didn’t even properly evaluate the 2018 midterms, they’re so blind in their Trump support. Republicans had record turnout out too. 2018 had ridiculously high, unprecedented turnout and the GOP lost a slightly above average amount of seats.
1307537203178995713 2020-09-20 12:28:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Yeah, it’s going GOP. What’s his face will be lucky to hold elected office ever again.
1307536544589393923 2020-09-20 12:26:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nc_groyp @JayFiveK True, but this horse might get crippled. I’m not very optimistic if Trump loses. If he wins re-election, he’s only the beginning. There’s a bright future ahead, regardless, just depends how long it takes to get there.
1307535672610357254 2020-09-20 12:22:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReformedMallard Can Ted vote to approve his own nomination? That would be funny.
1307535221378691074 2020-09-20 12:21:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nc_groyp @JayFiveK This isn’t about Q or any other distraction. Trust God’s plan. We have no other choice. Trump is our only shot.
1307535049647157248 2020-09-20 12:20:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nc_groyp @JayFiveK These people feed on it. Bottom feeders. We’re finally on the right track after decades of fighting. Are there bumps on the road? OF COURSE! But we’re finally in the fight. Stay the course.
1307534307523727364 2020-09-20 12:17:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MarcSpector12 @CottoGottfried The election is still a month and a half away. We could wake up one morning and learn something that convinced 60% of people to vote GOP. What? God only knows, literally. I wouldn’t bet on it, but it CAN happen.
1307533918657183744 2020-09-20 12:15:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MarcSpector12 @CottoGottfried I mean, anything is possible. I’ve seen crazier shit happen in politics.
1307531892720271363 2020-09-20 12:07:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump has almost singlehandedly reshaped the Republican Party. There’s more discipline than there has ever been. More unity of purpose. Now is not the time to change course.
1307531425810440193 2020-09-20 12:05:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried Alaska in particular is a very tight knit community.
1307531093109878785 2020-09-20 12:04:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MarcSpector12 @CottoGottfried Yeah, Cory Gardner will have to get really lucky to hold on.

1307530801865789441 2020-09-20 12:03:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried That’s literally the worst nightmare.
1307530580410675200 2020-09-20 12:02:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @markjbult @CottoGottfried That’s a worst case scenario. Arizona is far from guaranteed and neither is Maine.

1307529453837455362 2020-09-20 11:58:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> You know, this stuff happened pretty regularly on TV pre-2000.
1307527358207926273 2020-09-20 11:49:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat *Trump wins re-election* *He dies*   Trump’s will says his family should be President forever! How dare you disrespect the dead!
1307526256582422529 2020-09-20 11:45:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat @BronzeCullis It was modified. It’s no longer mandatory to have health insurance.

1307524089477844992 2020-09-20 11:36:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @ByzCat Good.
1307524034649784322 2020-09-20 11:36:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat The Republican Party is far left socially in most of the world TODAY.

1307520177077211136 2020-09-20 11:21:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OakOdyssey Elections have consequences, as it has been said.
1307519743243497473 2020-09-20 11:19:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Look, brunch is awesome. If you don’t like it, we probably can’t be that close.
1307519279034753026 2020-09-20 11:17:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Guys, you have to fold aces because it’s the right thing to do.
1307517447948431360 2020-09-20 11:10:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou There’s always a lot of retirements the cycle after you lose the House. The House is a lot less fun if you’re not in the majority.
1307515564450086912 2020-09-20 11:02:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The vast majority of that damage was done in the first election, so I doubt it.
1307514525227388928 2020-09-20 10:58:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer Your opinion unironically has more weight.
1307514370059051009 2020-09-20 10:58:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer You mean when McConnell said he wouldn’t confirm an opposite party’s nominee? Yeah, I agree.
1307514146636922880 2020-09-20 10:57:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @josiah_crawley @CrankyFed Anglicans are the true TradCats. I unironically believe this.
1307511744458358784 2020-09-20 10:47:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JBFalke I read A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. I think that’s the closest anyone has actually come.
1307505356592078849 2020-09-20 10:22:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SouthernConsDem The German Empire had a powerful navy that had no hope of fulfilling their strategic objectives. The United States could do that.
1307503928083349504 2020-09-20 10:16:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SouthernConsDem United States has the advantage of a ridiculously long coastline and zero real threats.
1307503265530155010 2020-09-20 10:14:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @deleted52248878 Anglicans aren’t doctrinally zionist.
1307503154876080128 2020-09-20 10:13:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The GOP lost by 9 points and still got like 200 seats. I really think people are underestimating their chances in the House. Even if they lose by 4 points they’ll gain a lot of seats.

1307500058296938499 2020-09-20 10:01:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @No2Sovereignty Better support is better support. The facts are the facts: The company that was given prototype STGs in 1942 LOVED them and more of them came home than expected. I don’t think any of them died. Germans officers were smart cookies and knew how to use them immediately.
1307498978779566080 2020-09-20 09:57:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @No2Sovereignty German industry was highly underrated. They could have pumped out these things by the millions if Hitler desired. He just didn’t.
1307498552252301317 2020-09-20 09:55:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @No2Sovereignty It markedly increased survivability in tests. To the degree it convinced Hitler to allow mass production when he was very opposed to it. If he hadn’t been opposed and made it a priority from the beginning, it could have been out much earlier and in large numbers.
1307498234131165184 2020-09-20 09:54:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @No2Sovereignty Hitler wasn’t. However, the soldiers loved the STG. It did marvelous on trials and markedly increased Eastern Front survivability.
1307497953301536773 2020-09-20 09:52:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @No2Sovereignty Yeah. From a military perspective, bolts were obsolete on any battlefield where the Americans were present. A lot of strategists of the side of the Axis knew this too.
1307496593587933185 2020-09-20 09:47:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @No2Sovereignty Yes.
1307495837430411264 2020-09-20 09:44:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @No2Sovereignty True, that’s why I’m discussing the different equipment decisions the Germans could have made.
1307495041628286976 2020-09-20 09:41:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @No2Sovereignty People problems are always fixable. Equipment issues are more set
1307494176465002497 2020-09-20 09:37:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @No2Sovereignty Biggest mistake the Germans made was not widely distributing the STG as soon as they could. If they pumped those things out as soon as they could, it would have held back the Soviets at least a year. Could have won the war if they were really aggressive.
1307493736595816450 2020-09-20 09:36:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @No2Sovereignty The Gewehr sucks. It was a remarkably unreliable gun. The K98 was a good rifle, but bolts just aren’t useful in the presence of mass fire unless wielded in the sniper role.

1307488875904933888 2020-09-20 09:16:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @No2Sovereignty This is because bolt action rifles are useless in the vicinity of a machine gun. Semi-autos are useful. So much fire could be laid down by an American squad it’s ridiculous.

1307478698719928324 2020-09-20 08:36:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Why? The Constitution clearly allows them to not consider it. Advice and consent, not just consent. Their advice? Fuck off, we’re going to win the election baby!
1307478408402817025 2020-09-20 08:35:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It really wasn’t long again when it was the universal report what the courageous stand was. The people claiming these moderates are “principled” are the lowest form of life: Traitors.

1307457757453352961 2020-09-20 07:13:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon Kelly is just too far left for the state. He’s photogenic and everything, but the race narrowed a lot the moment it got serious and now it’s even more serious.
1307456871452880898 2020-09-20 07:09:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon She was only 4 points behind in the last two reasonable polls. I think Trump wins the state 3-5 and drags McSally 2-3 points behind him.
1307447803178819585 2020-09-20 06:33:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV She has become a pure outrage merchant.

1307438388669227010 2020-09-20 05:56:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis Last two reasonable polls only had McSally down by 4 and she hasn’t attacked him on guns yet.
1307436917076774923 2020-09-20 05:50:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So, here’s what I see happening in the Senate now (no toss up version):  Dem Gains: Maine Colorado  GOP gains: Alabama Michigan  Michigan narrowed from a 20+ point race to a 6.5 point race over the course of the Kavanaugh hearings.
1307434475295567876 2020-09-20 05:40:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Yeah, Maine will slip away over this and Arizona comes closer.
1307434219820535814 2020-09-20 05:39:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton The Presidency could assert imperium and I think it would win in a pinch most of the time.

1307403729826582529 2020-09-20 03:38:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou A lot of this is Trump’s doing, but I think it would have happened with almost GOP Presidents.
1307403553393254407 2020-09-20 03:37:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The Senate GOP has improved drastically in discipline these past 6 years under McConnell’s majority leadership.
1307403342830874624 2020-09-20 03:37:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Because his caucus was terrible then. At least half a dozen defections.
1307403110424477697 2020-09-20 03:36:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly They’re picked up by other justices usually. Always a shitty situation.
1307402848578265089 2020-09-20 03:35:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Based.
1307402747319406592 2020-09-20 03:34:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon Someone called her an “outrage merchant” in reply to me last night. That’s about it: She thrives off ruling people up even when there’s nothing to be riled up about.
1307402405861093379 2020-09-20 03:33:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @SelimSeesYou Yeah, especially with this RBG thing.
1307402016419991552 2020-09-20 03:31:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Polls were already showing McSally miraculously narrowing the race against Kelly. Convinced she’s possible now.
1307400634015125504 2020-09-20 03:26:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon She’s also just misrepresenting what ACB said.
1307395951296942081 2020-09-20 03:07:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I can’t believe Ann is actually stupid enough to believe this.
1307387586097434628 2020-09-20 02:34:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Neither does the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

1307380886506217473 2020-09-20 02:07:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation There’s only so far you can push it before it’s just literal anarchy. Has to be some give and take here. Democrats still pass spending bills with Trump as President. Keeping an 8 member SCOTUS around for 4 years would cause all sorts of problems on the appellate level.
1307378061361459203 2020-09-20 01:56:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KevinAldrich2 @Guyfromnowhere1 @realikamusume Yeah, the conservative legal movement is specifically about putting stuff like this aside to make correct legal rulings. It’s about reducing judicial activism. You’re obviously going to disagree on legislative policy sometimes.
1307376615987519490 2020-09-20 01:50:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation At that point, you might as well just give up on any sort of constitutional government, though. You’re talking about potential 4 year impasses at that point. It also wouldn’t work for Republicans electorally if a Dem was President to hold out that long on any nominee.
1307373420691312645 2020-09-20 01:38:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Obama: Democrat. Senate: Republican.  If the Dems won the Senate in 2018, nothing we could do to shove an appointment down their throat anyway.
1307373018411343872 2020-09-20 01:36:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation That’s what he said. Why do you just believe whatever Democrats say they said?   Specifically he said the Senate hasn’t approved an opposite party nominee in an election year since 1888.
1307372638638084098 2020-09-20 01:35:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @devinsvigil @SelimSeesYou @HarmlessYardDog See United States v. Rock Island Armory.
1307372416121868292 2020-09-20 01:34:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @devinsvigil @SelimSeesYou @HarmlessYardDog That’s actually a possibility. The original case that affirmed it did so because it was a tax. Now that the machine gun registry is closed, it’s clearly more of a de facto ban. Never was properly challenged before the Supreme Court and courts are split on interpretation.
1307370328906240001 2020-09-20 01:25:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I’m convinced the Senate was saved by Kavanaugh. I think this will have the opposite effect: I think it will save McSally. A bit less bullish on Maine because of their “independent mindset.”
1307368844495814656 2020-09-20 01:19:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I don’t know who needs to hear this, but the words “boomer” and “cope” aren’t in themselves an argument.
1307365255497035776 2020-09-20 01:05:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer He doesn’t have moderates on the list and abortion doesn’t excite actual Democrat voters.

1307364641618657296 2020-09-20 01:03:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Guyfromnowhere1 @realikamusume She has a record: Including a rebuttal to the primary right wing concern about her. She cleared federal executions to restart earlier this year.
1307360955224002565 2020-09-20 00:48:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou People who vote on judges always break GOP. Even in 2018 they broke GOP. Very few in the Democrat voting coalition care much about the issue.
1307358166636781569 2020-09-20 00:37:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I'm surprised Britt Grant isn't on the shortlist. She's 42 from Georgia.
1307356418018816000 2020-09-20 00:30:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Allison Rushing is a Duke grad. ACB is a Notre Dame grad. Barbara Lagoa is a Columbia grad. No state schools, but plenty of non-HYS. Only Stanford female is Britt Grant.

It's of context.
1307351106666795008 2020-09-20 00:09:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @CottoGottfried @ozymandias31803 Personally, I prefer others over ACB, but her statements on this have been wildly misrepresented.
1307350921643520002 2020-09-20 00:08:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @CottoGottfried @ozymandias31803 The problem with Ann Coulter's opinion here is that it's clearly wrong: ACB was involved in clearing federal executions to start again.
1307349740171014145 2020-09-20 00:04:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Allison Rushing is 38. Age alone is a huge plus there.
1307348382940385280 2020-09-19 23:58:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Mr. President, we reject your nomination. We want the hottest member of the Federalist Society under the age of 30!
1307343030601617410 2020-09-19 23:37:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @KingFrenly She cleared a federal execution to go forward just a few months ago.
1307203714885857280 2020-09-19 14:23:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @PiousTusks @SelimSeesYou Yes, but I forgot the exact process of obtaining it. They’re supposed to talk it over with their clerks, and then their votes get submitted until they run out of room on the docket.
1307202032248524800 2020-09-19 14:17:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @PiousTusks @SelimSeesYou If I remember correctly, justices don’t talk to each other before they decide if they’re going to take a case. So, it’s something of a guessing game and there’s some rituals involving the clerks in this whole game.
1307201225264369664 2020-09-19 14:13:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @PiousTusks @SelimSeesYou I think it’s more about bouncing ideas off of people with different thought processes. There are some things the Justices try to strategize on: Like particularly if they want to take an appeal or not and know if they’re likely to win is important.
1307199383356821505 2020-09-19 14:06:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TrustThePlant @AnnCoulter She cleared a federal execution just this year: She has a record.
1307199280239837185 2020-09-19 14:06:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou It’s pretty smart to hire some opposing clerks. That’s why even most of the leftie judges do it from time to time. Don’t quote me on this, but I believe RBG didn’t, though.
1307198899900370944 2020-09-19 14:04:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou One benefit of being a stellar conservative law student is you’re significantly more likely to hit this lottery than the masses of AWFLs who fill law schools.
1307198587416260613 2020-09-19 14:03:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou Oh, yeah, you’re also guaranteed to get the most prestigious job: Appellate Practice. I’ve heard this also comes with the perk of less hours, but that’s a very relative term for these guys.
1307197995381911553 2020-09-19 14:01:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou SCOTUS clerk is like winning law school lottery, btw, and you get a huge payday when you leave. When I say "huge" I'm talking like 10x the average Amercans' salary just in bonuses.
1307197753815072768 2020-09-19 14:00:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou Squishier GOP picks do it on the basis of merit: Good grades, good school, know the right people, that sort of thing. They still do draw from Federalist Society members. Some on the left do hire right as well: I've heard Kagan does that quite a bit.
1307196344474492928 2020-09-19 13:54:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou Thomas definitely does. He's pretty ideological in his clerk hiring. Alito hasn't really hired enough people: It takes a long time to build a strong network of ex-clerks.
1307195764209262594 2020-09-19 13:52:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou There has been more talk about Alito retiring than I expected. I think he kind of just wants to be normal and move to Florida. Thomas should definitely do it, though.

1307194292021194755 2020-09-19 13:46:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks @southunionist Yes.

She's not saying the death penalty shouldn't be imposed in a case the law demands it,  just that someone with conscious objections should recuse and let someone else do it.
1307193746451312640 2020-09-19 13:44:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @southunionist The Olympics canceled Rugby because we were too good at it. They're just upset at our athletic prowess.
1307190183494909954 2020-09-19 13:30:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @GrayConnolly We are. We're just determining if we have a strong enough minority to retain control. And if we do, oh boy, is it going to be fun.
1307189780195799042 2020-09-19 13:28:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Imagine if the left sets themselves back on everything from gay rights to immigration because they decide to explode over this.
1307189363122548736 2020-09-19 13:26:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @GrayConnolly Of course, we just have to get it to support us, and suddenly it has all the political legitimacy of the Flensburg Government.
1307189195799228416 2020-09-19 13:26:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ljm_scuba @pabarlow @AnnCoulter She has a judicial record and you can't point to a bad ruling. Even on issues she hasn't written much about, such as the 2nd Amendment.
1307188949706772480 2020-09-19 13:25:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GrayConnolly This legitimacy crisis is entirely because the Dems refuse to consent to Trump's Presidency, but they still want to rule over the rest of America and they're attempting to force us to capitulate.
1307186979780653056 2020-09-19 13:17:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CatholicPods @pabarlow @AnnCoulter True: Her words were more about frontline district judges imposing a death penalty. Advocating recusal under conscious duress is actually far less activist than some who say the judge shouldn't impose the penalty due to their own private opinion.
1307185975676874753 2020-09-19 13:13:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Real_JohnTitor @thehangingchads That actually makes sense. The car doesn't appear to be moving erratically as you'd expect from some creep trying to film a TikTok video.

1307185380006002689 2020-09-19 13:10:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChancelThreader Geez. God's really got a message for these people they just don't want to hear.
1307185223675899905 2020-09-19 13:10:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Is she in the UK or something? She's using right hand drive.
1307184884784476160 2020-09-19 13:08:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp We were talking about the possibility of Presidents appointing young family members. There's literally no reason they can't constitutionally.
1307184515580911616 2020-09-19 13:07:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Stephen Breyer is 82. He could retire in Trump's 2nd Term. Thomas might retire to let a Republican appoint his successor. 5 Trump justices for the Court. He'll demand it be renamed the "Trump Court."
1307182042891812864 2020-09-19 12:57:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CatholicEcon @thehangingchads Honestly, I think Ann has been driving a ridiculous amount of sensationalism for the past couple of years. Like, we're going to have our disagreements with anyone and some stuff just isn't going to get done the way we want it to.
1307181598643806208 2020-09-19 12:55:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pabarlow @AnnCoulter ACB didn't bind herself to ruling on the basis of every utterance out of the mouth of Pope Francis or recusing herself on that basis either.
1307181212524568576 2020-09-19 12:54:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @pabarlow @AnnCoulter I agree, I find the reasoning questionable, but Ann Coulter is sensationalizing it and also misrepresenting what was actually said. ACB didn't say that Catholics should recuse themselves any time the Pope has an opinion on an issue: Just one specific morally weighty scenario.
1307180220630343682 2020-09-19 12:50:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnnCoulter That isn't quite what ACB said. She specifically said she thinks Catholic judges should recuse themselves from imposing the Death Penalty. Her reasoning is questionable, but her role as a SCOTUS Justice would be fundamentally different.
1307179974248497159 2020-09-19 12:49:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CatholicEcon @thehangingchads That isn't quite what ACB said.

1307179101908762627 2020-09-19 12:45:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Biden is already struggling with Hispanics. Try to drag them out to vote for people insulting their Church on national television.
1307178570582818818 2020-09-19 12:43:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @southunionist @MapleAndTea Old North Church? Only place I've ever seen this style is the South.
1307178183859605506 2020-09-19 12:42:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago @thehangingchads Funny thing is that this sort of thing is exactly why Know Nothings didn't want to let Catholics have citizenship.
1307178004540542976 2020-09-19 12:41:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MisesianChicago @thehangingchads It's pretty good, except for one issue: She has written that she thinks Catholic judges should recuse themselves in death penalty cases and her reasoning does lead to some skepticism about her reliability on immigration.
1307177483293339648 2020-09-19 12:39:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MapleAndTea @southunionist It's definitely an Anglican Church in the South, that much is for sure.
1307176749369884673 2020-09-19 12:36:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads This was my immediate thought. It could turn this race into a landslide.
1307176333085212672 2020-09-19 12:34:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Expat_Beagle_Oz All I have to say is I hope there's some body armor at the next gun show because none of the crap I can order online will be here before the election.
1307175670640975874 2020-09-19 12:32:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried I really hope Jason Lewis can pull off the upset.

1307173405439950855 2020-09-19 12:23:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried I never though Mitch would live up to it. He's going to be laughing all the way to the bank. The capstone: Trump wins epically in November. That's how this story ends. You couldn't have written this drama better.
1307172685693288450 2020-09-19 12:20:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It will not turn into a Kavanaugh circus. The hearings are a formality anyway. If it got really bad, they could just skip the whole charade. Graham doesn't have Jeff Flake holding a gun to his back.
1307171715521409025 2020-09-19 12:16:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Always has been.  https://t.co/lrhmC8sFzc

1307167605590024194 2020-09-19 12:00:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba Simple fact is that voters gave Mitch McConnell this power in 2016 and again in 2020.
1307166676132261889 2020-09-19 11:56:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The simple fact of the matter is the Senate can confirm it wants to. There's no precedent because one time it was controlled by a recalcitrant opposing party.
1307165833211379712 2020-09-19 11:53:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried Simple fact is the Senate doesn't have to confirm if it doesn't want to. If it wants to, no one can stop it.

1307103787933405185 2020-09-19 07:46:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis Same to be honest.
1307102836564668416 2020-09-19 07:42:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just heard the news.

1307066052971360256 2020-09-19 05:16:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MaritimeLoyal @texan_tory Part of the reason American soldiers are so effective is our average infantryman is raised with guns and knows how to use them from a young age.
1307065836918759424 2020-09-19 05:15:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MaritimeLoyal @texan_tory You guys only had your ARs taken away earlier this year (though, they were limited compared to our fairly unregulated regime). I just think men should own military style weaponry and be able to defend their families and the realm when called upon.
1307065260625592320 2020-09-19 05:13:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried I’m really not concerned about this: Even for Virginia, there’s only so many of these people, they’re high propensity, and incredibly anxious. This won’t mean Trump will lose it by any more votes than last time.
1307063987406864384 2020-09-19 05:08:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MaritimeLoyal @texan_tory Personally, the one distinctly American position that I'm extreme on is gun rights, but I'm not sure how "distinctly" American that is: I think it's the traditional Anglo-Saxon position.
1307059635145396225 2020-09-19 04:51:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MonarchistSpirt Exactly what I was getting at: Conservatives sat by and rigorously enforced the Constitution being used to destroy them covertly while egregiously violated against them as well because they confused the written constitution for the unwritten one that is far more important.
1307059159276441601 2020-09-19 04:49:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SavnRyansPrvate @RedEaglePatriot Those people have the highest propensity to vote already and they already do vote. There's no evidence this will produce a 500,000 vote margin in Virginia.
1307057686962417664 2020-09-19 04:43:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SavnRyansPrvate @RedEaglePatriot They already maxed that out in 2016 IMO.
1307056901667123205 2020-09-19 04:40:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MonarchistSpirt Conservatives try to preserve the laws and order of a society. It was really difficult with American law to directly assault the private conservatism of the average individual. So what they did was systematically use their organs of power to suppress us in every corner.
1307056194264223746 2020-09-19 04:37:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MonarchistSpirt We're all human and make mistakes. They're just never confronted on theirs at all.
1307055360386179077 2020-09-19 04:34:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed Yes, it was never as deranged as the French, especially in the anticlerical department, but it wasn't devoid of leftist tendencies or assertions.
1307055208187539456 2020-09-19 04:33:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CrankyFed We forget a lot of the more violent elements of the revolution.
1307054912539369473 2020-09-19 04:32:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MonarchistSpirt The average liberal has a remarkable ability to maintain cognitive dissonance. They'll read this, think it's crazy, and then pretend like they never saw it.
1307053427202158593 2020-09-19 04:26:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MonarchistSpirt Yeah, this whole "have sex with a mask on" think is just meant to insult conservatives.
1307052999274041344 2020-09-19 04:24:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @texan_tory American conservatives are so schizophrenic about stuff because their tradition is so inherently anti-conservative. They're essentially conserving their own defeat.
1307050918664458241 2020-09-19 04:16:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> *Puts Tory hat on*  American Conservatives: Our Revolution was nowhere near as leftist as other revolutions.  Also Americans:
1307049349655015425 2020-09-19 04:10:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 @bestgtor88 @PollWatch2020 Yeah, with those numbers, odds are he'll win at least one of the Big 4 states. Combine with Arizona and he's in the clear.
1307049027553431554 2020-09-19 04:09:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @celt_slavic I agree with Red Eagle: I think Delaware would have come into play if someone other than Biden was nominated. Not with Biden on top of the ticket. He won't win it by any more than previous Democrats, though.
1307047713838686215 2020-09-19 04:03:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayRico888_ @jdplankton Immediate calls should be like 20+ point races. 10-20 points can get called with only a few percentage points of the vote in. Beyond that it really depends.
1307047476298424325 2020-09-19 04:02:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayRico888_ @jdplankton I wouldn't trust any calls. I'm convinced they're going to call stuff when they shouldn't for Biden. If they call it, not saying it could still go for Trump, but it might not go for Trump by as much as an immediate call would indicate.
1307046282830188546 2020-09-19 03:58:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayRico888_ @jdplankton That said, I think the most likely outcome is a 5 point loss like last time, just with a rearranged electorate.
1307046150483120129 2020-09-19 03:57:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayRico888_ @jdplankton There's a chance it will be closer than last election IMO. I know a lot of NeverTrump types who sat out or voted third party voting for Trump now in NoVA. Trump lost a lot of votes compared to Mitt Romney there and the Mitt voters aren't AWFLs (not mostly).
1307045370560688130 2020-09-19 03:54:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot @Peoples_Pundit Postgrads seem highly oversampled. Like, there really aren't that many people walking around with master's degrees.
1307044605419040768 2020-09-19 03:51:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MarcSpector12 @RedEaglePatriot No competitive statewide race has reached that kind of landslide for Dems yet besides the 2008 and 2018 Senate races, which weren't really competitive and the GOP hardly contested.
1307044122189074432 2020-09-19 03:49:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MarcSpector12 @RedEaglePatriot That's reasonable, but that isn't to the left of Oregon. REP up here is predicting 12 point landslide: If that happens, you're going to see a national landslide for Biden. Like, Texas is in play with the demos needed to reach 12 point Dem in Virginia.
1307043443408080897 2020-09-19 03:46:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @labor_law_dad @RedEaglePatriot There was some slight GOP gerrymandering, but the last election roughly followed the proportions of their votes. It's harder for Democrats to come up with those kind of gerrymandered districts without making it obvious.
1307042928783745024 2020-09-19 03:44:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MarcSpector12 @RedEaglePatriot He lost by 5% last time. It was hardly some epic landslide.
1307041116374609921 2020-09-19 03:37:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot If Trump loses Virginia by 12, he's getting crushed nationally. With all the Democrat energy and enthusiasm of the past 3 years, they still only managed to capture 55 House of Delegates seats and edge out in a couple congressional races.
1307040157191806988 2020-09-19 03:33:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @fakeserpounce @CottoGottfried Well, California was much closer back in the day. I remember going to one of the last whistleblowing tour stops for Bush in Lodi, California when I was a kid.
1307039822910029824 2020-09-19 03:32:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot It's also literally like five minutes from the White House to Virginia.
1307039636745859072 2020-09-19 03:31:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot No, it won't vote to the left of Oregon. That's ridiculous.
1307039328976146434 2020-09-19 03:30:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jdplankton I think, at worst, it will vote 3-4 points left of the nation as a whole, like it did last time. The Dems really hit their ceiling for in 2016 in this state with Trump losing more than a hundred thousand votes in NoVA compared to Romney.
1307027167394529286 2020-09-19 02:42:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads @OnlyFans I'm for radical OnlyFans and Hollywood wealth redistribution. SEIZE THE MEANS OF PORN PRODUCTION!

1306991987309121536 2020-09-19 00:22:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot 3 days is reasonable and a lot of states already did it, but two weeks? Ridiculous.
1306990902116843520 2020-09-19 00:18:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @That_Guy_LV @realikamusume The problem for Democrats is so much Trump opposition is purely aesthetic. I honestly think someone with Trump’s platform, but better aesthetics, would be on track for a huge 40+ state landslide.
1306989870511017985 2020-09-19 00:14:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @That_Guy_LV @realikamusume I’m not convinced this is enough of a mass movement, either, though. We constantly see people switching parties even when the country is trending in the other direction. I do think the current Democrat coalition is very weak, though, and much weaker than it appeared in 2008-16.

1306984166777593857 2020-09-18 23:51:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Ok, this is hilarious. I don't care who you are.
1306983799499218951 2020-09-18 23:49:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @neoconremover My mom has come around over the years.
1306983457344679936 2020-09-18 23:48:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates God specifically ordered those and, as you point out, He did extend an offer for their repentance before doing so.
1306983197507547136 2020-09-18 23:47:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Christian leaders: We're supposed to be countercultural!  Also Christian leaders: Join cultural power centers in condemning White people as inherently racist.
1306983000165494785 2020-09-18 23:46:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Christian leaders: We must stand up to oppressive power systems that oppress people!  Also Christian leaders: Say nothing about the cultural genocide of a whole race of people.
1306982433569624067 2020-09-18 23:44:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It isn't morally acceptable to desire the destruction of any people group or their culture: Including White people and their nations. We have seen this clearly desired by many.
1306980783442321408 2020-09-18 23:37:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ImBatmanTwitch @DazzyJinzo @ScottMGreer "White Genocide is a conspiracy theory."  Also: "I can't wait until there are no more White people."  You are an evil person.
1306980248408518657 2020-09-18 23:35:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ImBatmanTwitch @DazzyJinzo @ScottMGreer I like how you come in attempting to be all neutral, and then just accuse anyone right of center of being some kind of Nazi crackpot. Have a nice day.
1306979705321672704 2020-09-18 23:33:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ImBatmanTwitch @DazzyJinzo @ScottMGreer You just denied we have valued at all. Just because you don’t like them doesn’t mean we don’t have them, dolt.
1306979300160176128 2020-09-18 23:32:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ImBatmanTwitch @DazzyJinzo @ScottMGreer I see: You’re stupid.
1306978718620024833 2020-09-18 23:29:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ImBatmanTwitch @ScottMGreer Education and morality are inseparable. Anything not right wing is bound to become left wing.
1306978032805187586 2020-09-18 23:27:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Oh, yeah, I’m convinced a million votes of that PV margin in 2016 come  simply from illegals in CA. However, that still doesn’t address if the people leaving are more GOP than the state average.
1306977305303150592 2020-09-18 23:24:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Given this, I still think the people leaving are more Republican than the state average. They might lean Democrat now, but not to the degree the state of California does by any stretch, and a lot of the moving people aren't voters either.
1306977003808198665 2020-09-18 23:22:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume You have to combine that with the fact that 2016 CA is one of the very few places where Clinton 2016 outperformed Obama 2008 by every metric. Also, the Libertarian vote was essentially equal to the national average.
1306975836998963200 2020-09-18 23:18:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @bestgtor88 @realikamusume In order to say this definitely, I'd think we need more data. We can tell the data from Florida simply because it's a state a lot of people move to. Arizona is a retirement state too, but it's not quite receiving floods of people to the same degree Florida is.
1306974703916060672 2020-09-18 23:13:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Other counterexamples: Romney won California Whites in 2012. Trump didn't in 2016. Trump was pretty popular among California Republicans from the beginning (it was Trump's primary backstop), so I don't think this is from a high concentration of NeverTrumpers.
1306973668661243905 2020-09-18 23:09:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Do we have any evidence of this besides anecdotal "my new California neighbor is a total libtard!"?   Bush got 5.5 million CA votes in 2004, McCain 5, Romney 4.8, Trump 4.5. Given the dynamics of those races, CA conservative exodus doesn't appear to have slowed much.
1306972834065940483 2020-09-18 23:06:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Austin, TX has received a disproportionate number of the liberal tech workers that are leaving due to job opportunities and mass corporate moves.
1306972491743662082 2020-09-18 23:04:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I'm not convinced. I think the electoral dynamics that will lead to Biden's overperformance in AZ were already native to Arizona. The people moving out of California are more Republican than the state average, as evidenced by how fast California has lost competitiveness.
1306971266889506818 2020-09-18 23:00:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III Same thing had already happened to "neocon" so they had to move on to something else.
1306970842996371460 2020-09-18 22:58:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChancelThreader If He is infinite, He already knows everything. If He knows everything, He wouldn't change His mind. The reason people change minds is because they discover something new (even if that's just a new emotion they experience over something). God cannot discover anything.
1306959951588454406 2020-09-18 22:15:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Lefties always do this: They act like if you haven't exhaustively read every single work of their ideology, you have no right to have an opinion. Meanwhile, they haven't so much as read a conservative opinion column in their entire life.
1306825937632325632 2020-09-18 13:22:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 @realRonDeSantis It would be pretty smart of them to hold back some ammo and have Trump drop it at the debate, though. Unless it’s unnecessarily risky.
1306819826606895106 2020-09-18 12:58:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis @RedEaglePatriot @reddvoyager1 @CottoGottfried @RealAPolitics @conn_paleo Trump’s “good debate” reputation is solely from his zingers. I do think he has refined his ability to produce zingers, so he might do better than last time.
1306814551862784005 2020-09-18 12:37:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks He’s the Harold Camping of neolib prognostication.
1306813263003496454 2020-09-18 12:32:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @feketemacska3 Also the Bible doesn’t teach the Earth is flat.
1306813205801570306 2020-09-18 12:32:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @feketemacska3 I don’t think it is actually deceptive if studied properly. The radioactive decay thing in particular is a joke and the fact it’s used at all is a testament to how little evidence there is for the foundational elements of the modern scientific mythology.
1306812560629477376 2020-09-18 12:29:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp It’s more insidious than that. It shuts down debate because the left uses momentary advantages in national polling to solidify gains and shut down conversation on issues. We’re never allowed to come to proper solutions to issues because it’s far too simplified by the data geeks.
1306811970927177732 2020-09-18 12:27:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks It has gotten so bad since 538 started doing their thing. Polls have obviously been a thing for a long time, but it was always part of a larger conversation. It wasn’t like “we’ve done a poll and so we’re just going to beat you with the fact you’re a minority!”
1306810794773032966 2020-09-18 12:22:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Can someone give me one thing incessant polling adds to the national conversation?  It was one thing when Gallup released a poll every two weeks. This “polls, polls, polls!!!” thing is just a way to distract people from the issues. It should be banned if this is what it is.
1306810200725299202 2020-09-18 12:20:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried Trump’s personal favorability has improved a lot since 2016. In many ways he and Obama are mirror images of each other: Obama was always personally well-liked while disapproved of on issues. Opposite for Trump.
1306809124265644033 2020-09-18 12:15:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @feketemacska3 Neanderthals, etc. were descendants of Adam and Eve and lived in the past ~6-8,000 years just like the rest of us.
1306805327673790464 2020-09-18 12:00:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @feketemacska3 Using the word “exhaustive” obfuscates the real issue: Is what is there true or not? The Bible is clear that Adam and Eve were there in *the beginning*. The flood account contains numerous falsehoods if it wasn’t a global event. These are just two problems among many.
1306804191453683712 2020-09-18 11:56:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @feketemacska3 That just isn’t the story that’s actually in the Bible and the question is about a “literal” Adam &amp; Eve, which is what the Bible portrays them as: The progenitors of the whole human race, to the exclusion of anyone else, and the origin of this whole journey our species is on.
1306802324761960448 2020-09-18 11:48:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV Two kings.

1306801948675497984 2020-09-18 11:47:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @feketemacska3 This is even further from a literal Adam and Eve than I thought you meant. Believing in a literal Adam and Eve means you believe that God specifically the original couple in a Garden and that death (of some kind anyway) entered the world through their transgression.
1306797818921791488 2020-09-18 11:30:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @feketemacska3 Young Earth is far more effective at that.
1306797628970205186 2020-09-18 11:30:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried What would possess you to do such a thing?
1306797381141311489 2020-09-18 11:29:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @feketemacska3 You *can* in the sense it is logically possible. However, it doesn’t really make much sense for the reasons you would want to do so. By believing in a literal Adam &amp; Eve you’re already rejecting the vast majority of the modern science myth, so why bother with the rest of it?
1306796995345084417 2020-09-18 11:27:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @feketemacska3 That isn’t a literal Adam &amp; Eve...
1306790143563620354 2020-09-18 11:00:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden I don’t even know what these people want anymore. Their project is a dead project. Like, it already failed and everyone knows it already failed. People running around claiming to be some socialist refuse to actually make concrete demands on anything.
1306786441696096256 2020-09-18 10:45:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden Oh, yes, it's all part of the conspiracy.   Does it ever occur to the people who think this way that the people they are talking about are flesh and blood humans? I think they took Icke reptillian memes too literally.
1306784930534494208 2020-09-18 10:39:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Candace28110975 @CottoGottfried The Supreme Court of the United States is extremely reticent to intervene on a question like this. Ultimately it is a question of state law, and the Penn SC ruling doesn't really interfere with Federal Constitutional norms.
1306783441011306497 2020-09-18 10:33:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden What exactly did Hillsdale do? I've seen a lot of chatter about them, but not sure what exactly the controversy is.   I don't follow Logo because I don't want a cursed timeline.
1306783084122189832 2020-09-18 10:32:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation We're likely to get another two next term, especially if Biden wins. Breyer is pretty old.
1306780982784163844 2020-09-18 10:23:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This dude is only slightly more associated with Scranton than I am and I've never been there in my life.
1306769763306274817 2020-09-18 09:39:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If anyone should get it for this cycle, it's Trump.
1306758758798852097 2020-09-18 08:55:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou It only get worse from here. Their lack of political will to stop this will likely end up being devastating when the population bomb in Africa explodes. The only thing that will be in between Europe and total domination by those hordes will be the laws of nature.
1306757080221724672 2020-09-18 08:49:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried I've heard these people call Netanyahu a fascist and Israel an "apartheid state" (which, to the ears of the average person, means "Nazi"). Ideological nuance isn't their strong suit.
1306755979715981313 2020-09-18 08:44:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sulla_henry @southunionist Also underrated, but not a Bourbon Democrat.
1306755389078241281 2020-09-18 08:42:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @southunionist Grover Cleveland isn't the best President we've ever had, but he is probably the most underrated.

His actions in Charlottesville alone did terrible harm to the dissident right that was growing in strength. It really pisses me off, actually.

1306733632288157696 2020-09-18 07:15:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @horatio__92 It’s vaguely possible for certain practical subjects to be taught without too many ethical considerations mixed in. Like math. However, we’re talking about history and that subject is particularly fraught with moral questions.
1306733148756226049 2020-09-18 07:13:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Steak followed by bread pudding for me.
1306732644634431488 2020-09-18 07:11:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @horatio__92 I’m not saying the curriculum should teach falsehood. That’s obviously immoral. However, morality and education go hand in hand. Teaching children to respect the traditions of their country is important.
1306731900900343808 2020-09-18 07:08:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @horatio__92 Yeah, we’re trying to have that pluralism without recognizing the plural in it. It’s in the word itself.
1306729380538978304 2020-09-18 06:58:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> You can’t divorce morality from education.
1306725031221907457 2020-09-18 06:41:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GengarJew420 It has to do with the rising Hispanic vote, but I don’t think this is happening near as fast as people think it is. Also, it won’t be enough to put Arizona out of reach for Republicans for a while. However, it does make the state more purple combined with other dynamics in play.
1306715759406714880 2020-09-18 06:04:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Kingreardon @ScottMGreer Personally it was my fave in the waiting room.
1306709031571140608 2020-09-18 05:38:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I don't understand why Conservatives are so reticent to use state power in the manner used against them for decades now. Like, we don't even have to actually do anything, just withdraw funds.   We can't even get something basic like PP unfunded because of dolts, though.
1306708499372683264 2020-09-18 05:35:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer Not politically, necessarily, but at least engaging.
1306708408435912704 2020-09-18 05:35:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer You know, there was a time when the New Yorker was good.

1306703990139301890 2020-09-18 05:18:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PrimetimePurity @CottoGottfried I think he's finally coming back down to Earth. He's very photogenic and everything, but I think he's far to the left of Arizona politically. Much more so than Sinema. Particularly on gun rights.
1306703392778022912 2020-09-18 05:15:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried I took a look at the internals earlier today and they make sense at first glance. It is essentially a tie ball game in Arizona. I think that gives an edge to Trump from the come home effect.
1306698138921644038 2020-09-18 04:54:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou This is actually pretty standard in most states with a lot of mail ins. Alaska is even more generous for obvious reasons.
1306698005609959431 2020-09-18 04:54:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou No, it appears they still need to be postmarked by Election Day: "Ballots that are eligible to be counted must be postmarked by the time polls close and be received by county election boards at 5 p.m. on Nov. 6, three days after the Nov. 3 election."
1306695375365996547 2020-09-18 04:43:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Media: We're going to report on this election differently than we have ever done in the past.  Cons: Wow, I wonder what's up since you're telling us you're going to change this key aspect of our political system?  Media: WHY ARE YOU SOWING DISTRUST IN DEMOCRACY?
1306692617594384384 2020-09-18 04:32:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba Yeah, we'd be paying out the ass for a decent rig, but not for the software to put on it.
1306692469216735243 2020-09-18 04:32:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba Even if AMD had gotten stuck behind Intel, the mere fact of their existence is enough to keep the x86 platform relatively open on the software front.
1306690805667635201 2020-09-18 04:25:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba It's good that two companies own the rights to the x86 architecture and the platform is essentially open in the software realm. Can't imagine what kind of expensive horror the PC world would be if Intel was the only company with x86.

1306650230599954433 2020-09-18 01:44:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TRElections @CottoGottfried A difference? Yes. Ultimate difference? I don't think so. I think most third party voters wouldn't vote regardless.
1306649822217281537 2020-09-18 01:42:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried I still don't like it. I doubt it will make an ultimate difference in the race, but limiting voter choice in this way is ridiculous.
1306649442238558213 2020-09-18 01:41:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Modern Christians actively endanger the Commonwealth with their lack of moral courage in politics and have for many, many decades, perhaps centuries.
1306649169189384192 2020-09-18 01:40:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Bible:   Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry  Modern Christians:  It doesn't matter who you vote for or why. Who cares?
1306648335076544515 2020-09-18 01:36:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 @HeritageNLegacy Exactly: I'm no strict theonomist or anything, but these people are positing a completely different moral structure than the Old Testament. As if God suddenly changed his mind on what sin is.
1306646655945584640 2020-09-18 01:30:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 @HeritageNLegacy tHaTs olD TEStaMenT!
1306645719089139712 2020-09-18 01:26:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Really, what's the difference at this point? Most of these people are functional atheists: Blind to spiritual conflicts and take their moral cues from society at large. They just mix Jesus in when convenient.
1306640265030111237 2020-09-18 01:04:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Taliaferro_98 LMAO.
1306634597086699522 2020-09-18 00:42:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DanielB94640224 Right now, a lot of Biden's lead in AZ is coming "OH Predictive Insights" that gave him +10, which is just ridiculous. Monmouth just had Biden+2, which is possible.
1306634336930803713 2020-09-18 00:41:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DanielB94640224 Arizona seems almost counter-cyclical this cycle: When Trump improves nationally, AZ slips away. When Trump collapses nationally, AZ stays close or gets closer. It's really difficult to say. Ultimately I think Trump pulls it off.
1306632889212252163 2020-09-18 00:35:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DanielB94640224 It's ~35-31% Republican. Arizona's independents seem to be more independent than many, though. Biden might end up getting an unusual share of the Indie &amp; GOP vote in AZ, even compared to other states this cycle, but, if so, it points to no long term trend.
1306631618283679744 2020-09-18 00:30:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @llano_queipo Yeah, I don't get that move. She had already been rejected by voters. Almost seems insulting. Ultimately, I think he will pull her up more than visa versa. She wasn't crushed in 2018: She lost by like 60,000 votes.
1306630418230398977 2020-09-18 00:25:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If Arizona was really being pushed out of reach for Republicans, it would show up in registrations.
1306630175564673024 2020-09-18 00:24:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Registration isn't the be-all, end-all, but in order to believe the idea that Arizona is has become a 5-10 point Biden state, you have to believe right-leaning independents have somehow started breaking against Trump.
1306629842826297344 2020-09-18 00:23:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Arizona is swinging wildly left!  Also this:
1306622884069154816 2020-09-17 23:55:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WhoWasThurs @Woke_TGC It seems to be the pinnacle of racism. Not even the Blacks can get away with it.
1306622194697539584 2020-09-17 23:53:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Good episode today.   Also, Maricopa is ridiculous in some of these polls. Does anyone in Arizona actually believe there has been some tectonic shift to the left?
1306618480494628864 2020-09-17 23:38:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CEOofBarron @SelimSeesYou For reference, the last time there was a split decision in a coinciding Senate Special election was 1966 in South Carolina where Strom Thurmond was reelected as a Republican (was a Democrat in the last election) while Fritz Hollings was narrowly elected over Marshall Parker.
1306617107401113600 2020-09-17 23:32:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CEOofBarron @SelimSeesYou In those odd special election circumstances, though, the popular incumbent tends to drag the new guy along. You don't get people splitting ticket for essentially the same office to that degree ever. Tina Smith isn't running as well this time.
1306609369396764673 2020-09-17 23:02:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Metro conservatives think they're getting some huge upgrade by going to the next most liberal city.

There are some things that different local areas (including countries) just can't produce economically at all. I want anti-fragile supply systems, but not at the cost of any kind of economy.
1306604370805567491 2020-09-17 22:42:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @ByzCat Generally agreed with this reason, but I have a rather expansive definition of national security to include secure supply lines for toothpaste.
1306603591529123846 2020-09-17 22:39:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat Closer to protectionism, but I am kind of sick of the autarkists.

1306601240051232770 2020-09-17 22:29:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III You just know it's taken out of all context too. I'm just surprised they're still dragging this stuff out. Like, how many women has Donald Trump supposedly "assaulted" over the years at this point?
1306597104668860418 2020-09-17 22:13:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III I would somewhat agree on the grounds genetic laziness is part of their handicap and just to get a higher basedness score.
1306595818548404224 2020-09-17 22:08:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PerfInjust A lot of these people were the same ones who said the Church shouldn't be involved in politics 10 years ago. Probably got tired of having to defend this blatant hypocrisy.

A lot of people are fooled by colorblind rhetoric, but the root of basedness is the ability to confront the truth even when inconvenient.

1306345684275204096 2020-09-17 05:34:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I actually have known people like this. They’ll call themselves a Republican and then take the leftist side on nearly every issue.

1306320690593886210 2020-09-17 03:54:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads It's just projection.
1306320488629764097 2020-09-17 03:54:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume If Trump wins and life is good in 2024, I think Pence wins reelection by 5-10 points nationally.
1306319216962928642 2020-09-17 03:49:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @breddy_gud That's not how charges work. People are regularly charged with a litany of crimes and then acquitted on some and convicted on others.
1306318907557507073 2020-09-17 03:47:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Would be weird if Wisconsin &amp; Minnesota voted GOP and Arizona voted Democrat.
1306312317458624513 2020-09-17 03:21:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume @realBenLeBlanc Yeah, I don't think it's worth it to get too more aggressive on the issue. Too risky and the Dems are mostly digging their own grave with it.
1306312058003173376 2020-09-17 03:20:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume This is exactly what happened in 2016. Trump won Florida early in the night and Clinton had to try to hang on in all 4 of the contested rust belt states and she only kept 1.
1306311707942432768 2020-09-17 03:19:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realBenLeBlanc @realikamusume Trump could probably flat our win Hispanics if he went full IDPol against BLM. Would probably be totally conceding the suburban White vote, though.
1306310913134387205 2020-09-17 03:16:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK It's honestly pretty confusing.
1306307833961553920 2020-09-17 03:03:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK So, scrap the poll. Apparently the sample is global and Trump support is primarily coming from Africa and Russia. LMAO.
1306307489395281920 2020-09-17 03:02:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 @SelimSeesYou Ok, so get this, scrap the poll, but apparently the Trump support is coming from gay Blacks in Africa and also Russians.
1306307165142110211 2020-09-17 03:01:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 @SelimSeesYou It was an LGBT survey crazily enough. Was a specific dating app, but I'm not sure dating app usage and political affiliations vary that widely (with obvious exceptions):  https://t.co/LGdoEp3TFw
1306306102884270081 2020-09-17 02:56:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 @SelimSeesYou Like, it's vaguely possible they polled too many gays who live in places like rural South Carolina, but the odds of that are extremely low.
1306305819391262720 2020-09-17 02:55:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @cope_killa_99 @SelimSeesYou 1200 sample size on a demo with about 5 million members yields a margin of error 3% w/ 95% confidence or 4% w/ 99% confidence. It's a good survey and because it's targeted at a specific group, we don't have to ask too many questions about the details of sub demos.
1306304531593146371 2020-09-17 02:50:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @SelimSeesYou Exactly:  https://t.co/gOqsHPv75P
1306304415045951488 2020-09-17 02:50:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Trump's strategy here is far more viable long term than the Dems: Temporarily concede ground to the Democrats while solidifying a group of supporters that are difficult for the Dems to win back (by their own doing, no less) and then to attack the traditional GOP turf.
1306303511278301185 2020-09-17 02:46:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The entirety of Biden's edge right now resides in college educated White voters in the suburbs. This a traditionally GOP voting group. All that has to happen is for these people to either come home or be flat out lying in their true preference.
1306302782673170432 2020-09-17 02:43:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JayFiveK @SelimSeesYou I just don't see how it's possible Trump loses with these types of numbers. Note that this survey is likely far more accurate than any national poll given that it is highly targeted at the specific demographic.
1306300591606501376 2020-09-17 02:35:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you're buying this SC Q poll, might I remind you that you are, in fact, stupid and gullible?  https://t.co/f6ow1pZDVp

All that has to happen for Trump to win (nationally, as well as MN) is for enough of them to be expressing a false preference and "enough" isn't very many statistically.
1306290613013413888 2020-09-17 01:55:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @celeste43_ @RedEaglePatriot @Man77Nc And I've talked to people I've known who have lived in the Iron Range in the past 4 years.

Everywhere else he got a solid improvement over Romney that wasn't just aberrational because of split votes. I don't think Obama voters vote for McMullin because they don't like Clinton. That makes little sense.
1306289235335491584 2020-09-17 01:49:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @celeste43_ @RedEaglePatriot @Man77Nc Trump is winning Romney&gt;Other voters, which is a significant chunk of people in MN. What happened in MN is that the electoral map shifted. Trump didn't get a higher vote total, but he got the traditional Democrat rural vote and got it with a majority in many blue counties.
1306287341431140355 2020-09-17 01:42:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @celeste43_ @RedEaglePatriot @Man77Nc He only lost by 1.5%. It is perhaps less elastic, as demonstrated by the fact it’s the one of those 4 he didn’t win, but 0 chance? If he has 0 chance at it, he has 0 chance at the election.
1306286558283210757 2020-09-17 01:39:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @celeste43_ @RedEaglePatriot @Man77Nc He would have to gain elsewhere. I don't see Minnesota being lost by 10% and him winning Wisconsin, for instance.
1306286057890164736 2020-09-17 01:37:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @celeste43_ @RedEaglePatriot @Man77Nc If Biden gets back into the 60s, I'm a bit skeptical of Trump's overall chances. This is a place that has almost come back to life under Trump's watch. If he can't narrow the margins by even a smidge, that's not good for him.
1306283306946830336 2020-09-17 01:26:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @celeste43_ @RedEaglePatriot @Man77Nc Even if you assume every single third party votes Dem, which seems unlikely given their expressed preferences, Trump still narrowed the county from a 30 point to a 20 point loss and that's pretty big.
1306282282295136258 2020-09-17 01:22:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @celeste43_ @RedEaglePatriot @Man77Nc Including McMullin and Johnson gets to 45% right-leaning. Only 1.67% Green. It was actually 39.7%, so proper rounding means Trump got 40%. Low 40s seems almost certain. If Johnson+McMullin come home, 45% is par for the course. Even more optimistic now, actually.
1306281129767571457 2020-09-17 01:17:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot @celeste43_ @Man77Nc St. Louis is a huge county too. If the northern half (the actual Iron Range, Duluth isn't technically in the Range) of the county votes overwhelmingly Trump and Southern half stays even with 2016 or maybe slightly higher for him, he can win it.
1306280333554462720 2020-09-17 01:14:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot @celeste43_ @Man77Nc It is more possible. It went from 63-33 Obama 2012 to only 51-39 in 2016. A net 12 point gain almost seems like: This place has benefited more than any other singular county in the United States from Trump's economic policies.
1306278345655619590 2020-09-17 01:06:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @celeste43_ @Man77Nc @RedEaglePatriot Trump might win it overall. He significantly narrowed the margin in St. Louis County (the only populous county with Duluth) in 2016 already. The other 3 counties were very narrow in favoring Clinton. I suspect he at least breaks even there, but depends on Duluth.
1306277129710075906 2020-09-17 01:01:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @celeste43_ @Man77Nc @RedEaglePatriot I really just don't see those Iron Range Democrat Mayors coming out to endorse Trump unless he was genuinely popular there.

1306078862426677249 2020-09-16 11:54:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Police are essential to this task. Yes, we live in a polity that is largely hostile to good, peaceable citizens and not hostile enough toward malefactors, but the means of changing that isn’t to become malefactors ourselves.
1306078512747552768 2020-09-16 11:52:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Rightists who are saying we shouldn’t defend police over BLM activities are resting far too much on their ultimate ideological objectives. Before any of that can be achieved, it is vital that there is peace and order in a commonwealth.

Delaware is a state where there are just more Democrats. Republicans only win by winning a huge majority of Indies and even cutting into Democrats. DE is a closed primary, so registered Indies don't vote in primaries..

1306068846252642304 2020-09-16 11:14:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @AnglicanMan19 I can identify the moment when they heated up the rhetoric against Russia. Sochi Winter Olympics 2014: Suddenly Bob Costas is reminded you that Russia used to be the USSR and are bad guys. A month later the whole Ukraine thing boiled over. Convenient timing, that.
1306065276514045955 2020-09-16 11:00:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @AnglicanMan19 How did it all sink this low? Magnamity is a great virtue and essential to diplomacy and peace: It is spurned. Everything is petty. It's all about reopening old wounds. Nothing is ever allowed to heal or for the dead to stay dead.
1306061644947238912 2020-09-16 10:45:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden It was the Kurds who really took back Mosul. The Iraqis are a bit better than the Gulf Arab tribesmen I'm talking about, though.
1306061477699346432 2020-09-16 10:44:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @AnglicanMan19 Look at the whole ISIS thing: That was an embarrassment. Yes, we were there when we shouldn't have been, but you can't just let some insane gang of hostile thugs roll over a major city in a country you recently occupied and not really do anything effective about it.
1306060634765787136 2020-09-16 10:41:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden @AnglicanMan19 He literally made about the dumbest possible call in any given situation. When we should have intervened, he was out of the way. When we should have stayed out, he was there all half-assed. Syrian disaster was averted only by the fact literally no one wanted that.
1306060226525831168 2020-09-16 10:39:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden That's what I'm saying.

1306057058521878529 2020-09-16 10:27:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot @LaurenWitzkeDE Notably the primary numbers look ok for the GOP. Like, they're running on par, maybe a little higher, than normal compared to the Dems. No sign there's some massive Democrat turnout coming from nowhere.
1306054976297480192 2020-09-16 10:19:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @SirDowden It really is. Literally all of this could have been done under Obama (I don't think it could have been done under Bush because of the war), especially in his 2nd term. But he didn't care about peace, America, or anything relevant to solving the problem.
1306053168460115968 2020-09-16 10:11:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirDowden I think Trump's idea is brilliant, actually: American security firms are taking over a lot of defense work for these states and getting paid a lot of money that flows back to the States for it. A small US military presence is maintained to deter open hostilities with us.

KSA was a backwater, the UAE and other gulf states didn’t exist yet. Israel was our only reasonable opportunity at an ally in the region.

1305982115348131841 2020-09-16 05:29:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_Rep00_ Determining who votes is hard because it's self-selecting. Getting the demos right is key to getting the correct numbers. This is why campaigns invest millions on conducting large internal surveys of tens of thousand of voters. This gives them freedom to make multiple guesses.
1305981857599758336 2020-09-16 05:28:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_Rep00_ The dirty secret about polls that they don't tell you is that there are so many factors that go into them, it's ideally a "best guess" as to what an electorate looks like. A scientific survey is only good if it samples the right population. That's harder than it sounds. 1/2

1305979166156886017 2020-09-16 05:17:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AgainCav I know for sure that the UAE and Israel didn't openly trade and it was illegal to bring Israeli made goods into the country. Not that this was enforced strictly, but nothing is there (except drug laws).
1305978789487403008 2020-09-16 05:16:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @_Rep00_ Yeah, a lot of these top line numbers make no sense of the internals of the poll when compared to past data points. Like, they're just obviously oversampling some groups of people more than others unless you assume the demos of the country have shifted radically from 2016.
1305976447488667648 2020-09-16 05:07:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If those numbers can be close to average across the country, I just don’t see Trump losing. 40% of households have a gun. Winning them by double what you’re losing non-gun households means winning. These numbers here put Trump at 50 guesstimated.
1305974989414436865 2020-09-16 05:01:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy I like how these people are prognosticating based on individual days. As if there weren’t really bleak days for the Trump campaign in October 2016.
1305972985212407809 2020-09-16 04:53:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Blac6kywalker @RyanGirdusky Whites will be a majority of the vote for a long time and they’re the most attracted to GOP messaging. I do not believe in compromising any core principles to appeal to other demographics.
1305964981700227072 2020-09-16 04:21:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky The White vote has always been the most malleable vote. It seems far less likely for a Trump minority voter to defect back to the Dems than visa versa. This is one reason why I remain optimistic about the prospects for Trump's reelection
1305964378580230151 2020-09-16 04:19:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky Natives are an underrated voting group for the GOP (mostly because they don't play any role in any swing states except Arizona). If Trump can bump up to 35-40 among Asians, he could conceivably win the "other" demo.
1305957302864838661 2020-09-16 03:50:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @illewminatus @xmackaveli @heckyessica If you aren’t afraid of going to jail, you’re even more stupid than the idiot who shot the cops.
1305957137932320768 2020-09-16 03:50:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is what you say when you’re truly delusional about human nature. These people genuinely believe the only reason there are bad guys is “systems of oppression.” There’s no excuse for committing a crime.
1305955956589842433 2020-09-16 03:45:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot I doubt it. There are still fence sitters, especially among the shy voters.
1305954912443019265 2020-09-16 03:41:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @billsretpal Well, there’s that one guy who is ratio’d to hell.
1305954728480829440 2020-09-16 03:40:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpeedDemon1738 @HarmlessYardDog Just for reference: Not even Illinois has a gun registry. The only two states that require long gun registry are Hawaii and California. A few more require handgun registration (notably NY), but not many.
1305953518621261826 2020-09-16 03:35:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpeedDemon1738 @HarmlessYardDog The vast majority of guns aren’t registered and most states have no registry. This is based on a poll with a very poor methodology. The Wyoming number, for instance, is essentially meaningless because it has a margin of error of 49%, so it could be anywhere from 3-100%.
1305952330102321152 2020-09-16 03:31:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnnysobieski Hint: In Oakland, it's even higher.

1305949103184965633 2020-09-16 03:18:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III They then highlighted the most irrational elements of the opposition. Your average boomer conservative would have been ok wearing a mask in April as long as normal life was put on a path to return. That isn't what happened: We were specifically told life would be changed forever.
1305948642696728576 2020-09-16 03:16:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III Let's not forget all of this is stoked by an elite trying to specifically engender this and blow it out of proportion. If states had adopted rational policies and kept rational goals in mind, this wouldn't have taken off at all. Instead they chose to destroy peoples' lives.
1305945136304709633 2020-09-16 03:02:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There is no excuse for this. If you attack law enforcement in the performance of their duties, your trial should be swift and the punishment death. Law enforcement is what having a civilized society is about.
1305935003319181317 2020-09-16 02:22:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon Fairfax now does the same thing in Virginia.
1305934403609268225 2020-09-16 02:19:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The Second Amendment is couched in the liberal idea of "rights," but it's really about your duty to protect your home, your family, community, and, ultimately, the Realm, from all enemies.
1305934057050640385 2020-09-16 02:18:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If I was less lazy, I'd make a tweet storm about why gun rights are the traddest thing about America and why the Second Amendment has its roots deep in Christian (and, more especially, Protestant) Civilization.
1305932218343227393 2020-09-16 02:11:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon If any race in Washington State is within 5 points, I assume it was rigged by King County.
1305931401917759489 2020-09-16 02:08:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon I think you mean 2000. 1998 was kind of a landslide.
1305928617617174531 2020-09-16 01:57:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wandlearner That's what I love about it: It's like, hey look, our voters and bureaucrats are a little bit special and don't know how to count votes. They need like three rounds to get it right. This is especially on display in WA-2004 where the King County Chairman screwed up his own ballot.
1305925826131775488 2020-09-16 01:45:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @johnnysobieski Also "homeschooled my entire teen years" reads to me as "I let this kid get out of control and my attempts at correction were too little and too late." Note she doesn't say "I was always homeschooled."
1305925270449389569 2020-09-16 01:43:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Washington 2004 Gubernatorial. Minnesota 2008 Senate. Virginia 2013 Attorney General. Any time there's a close recount, mysteriously the Democrat gets more votes. You'd think by accident once in a blue moon the GOP would find a trunk of ballots if this is all up and up.
1305924164742774784 2020-09-16 01:39:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @reformedindixie The dead. The people who moved 5 years ago. Apparently grandmas who vote by mail are much more Democrat than grandmas that walk in to vote: Why? Divine will, I supposed.
1305923224845377537 2020-09-16 01:35:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Someone mentioned how, with the exception of the 2000 Florida recount, a Republican has never won a major recount in recent memory. Like, how does every recount always produce more Democrat votes? Any fool can tell you.
1305919975111172096 2020-09-16 01:22:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AetiusRF @NationalistTV The first debate is scheduled for less than two weeks from now. If Biden doesn't debate, it won't go well for him.
1305917439327305733 2020-09-16 01:12:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation If you exclude media and uni polls (except Emerson), a lot of these errors aren't as bad.
1305917264915505152 2020-09-16 01:11:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation State levels were really bad in some places. MI had Clinton up by 3.6 (excluding Trafalgar makes this a lot worse), and WI was Clinton+6. No avg in MN, but the last poll had Clinton up 10 when she won 1.5. Also, notably, there were points in October that were terrible.
1305911120159477768 2020-09-16 00:47:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There's a reason everyone covered "Obamaphones," but not the housing program in the suburbs.
1305910911413235719 2020-09-16 00:46:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is really what happened during the Obama Presidency: A lot of sneaky little programs you never heard about (unless they were mostly harmless) that remade suburbia and some rural areas over the course of 8-10 years (they couldn't all be stopped immediately).
1305909829370871811 2020-09-16 00:42:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation This is why Reagan paid off the Japanese who went to the internment camps.

Fraud is centered in urban cores run totally by Democrats top and bottom: It's not very effective in a state like SC or IA. Even their big cities feature a political balance.
1305905033238786050 2020-09-16 00:23:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ComradeDoyIe Conservatives are open to correction and reason. Most of our opinions are based on practical realities (though we stay committed to core values). The left lives on empty platitudes.
1305903290174132224 2020-09-16 00:16:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Yeah, I’m trying and I can’t come up with a worse scenario.
1305902955804200962 2020-09-16 00:15:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot This is like a horrifying worst case scenario on a bad night. CO, AZ, NC, ME, GAx2, SC, and IA and lose Alabama somehow (or win AL and lose MT).
1305899682330226695 2020-09-16 00:02:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It’s amazing people actually think Hillary Clinton cares whether they live or die.
1305899032301187073 2020-09-15 23:59:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp We have lots of precedent for school choice leading to voluntary segregation. A lot of Southern towns did this to evade integration rulings and it worked very well. Of course, this was later deemed unacceptable racism.

1305880838400282626 2020-09-15 22:47:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @38658O583 I was born in the early 90s, so I understand what you mean. It really did feel like the world order was set. Even 9/11, while angering, seemed like an impotent attempt to crash an unsinkable ship.
1305880149632614402 2020-09-15 22:44:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CantusLaudanum Any differences are of degree, not kind. People have been complacent due to prosperity before. Many ancients speak of this. We simply have not lived in modern society long enough, even under a secular view, to have evolved into different creatures. We have the same desires.
1305879426140459008 2020-09-15 22:41:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If you vote for Trump, you will die. Of course, if you vote for Biden, you will also die. You might also kill him: Who knows if his feeble body can handle the stresses of the office?
1305878648587771904 2020-09-15 22:38:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis It was contained, not banished.
1305878370757095426 2020-09-15 22:37:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Some people, left &amp; right, think some things just "can't happen" anymore. This is foolish. Of course they can.
1305878100954304512 2020-09-15 22:36:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I don't understand why people think modern people are so different that earlier people. There is nothing new under the sun. People are the same today as they were yesterday. Evil has been set on the loose, but this has happened before.
1305877153289048064 2020-09-15 22:32:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LanceVader @AStratelates No, postmillennialists do not believe the millennium has already happened. They believe it will occur at a future time, but Christ won't come until after. This is often mixed in modern times with a symbolic understanding of the millennium, but wasn't historically.
1305870831445250048 2020-09-15 22:07:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Now you know why they're so desperate for mail ins (in addition to the obvious ballot harvesting schemes).
1305867802864234499 2020-09-15 21:55:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads I'm not sure they tried to pin the pro-family, anti-gay social conservatives with this label this early in the game. At least not from mainstream people like Frum.
1305864980617736194 2020-09-15 21:44:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MattWalshBlog It really is that dumb.

That extremely common sensical opinion is enough to get you labeled a right wing extremist these days.

1305740345922158592 2020-09-15 13:28:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Trust is a difficult thing to quantify, but I’ve followed this issue for a long time. I don’t remember Cruz being wishy washy. I do remember him supporting more H1bs, but nearly everyone was from the climate: That was preferable to pathways to citizenship that seemed inevitable.

1305726042850635782 2020-09-15 12:32:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads You’re just wrong. Cruz ran on building a wall when he ran for Senate in 2012. He also was key to opposing the Gang of 8 amnesty bill in the Senate.
1305724632218193920 2020-09-15 12:26:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @thehangingchads Part of the reason it was so brutal is Ted thought he was going to play the role Trump did. It was funny watching the moderate establishment sidelined for these two to duke it out over aesthetics of what was essentially the same platform. He did come around before Election Day.
1305718985644703747 2020-09-15 12:03:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis This whole incident is little understood. What do you expect? Everything is now “White man did bad thing because White man EVIL!”
1305709377165447168 2020-09-15 11:25:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot 2018 was simply an unprecedented midterm election. It's really difficult to take any lessons from it because the turnout was simply unprecedented. Is it a sign of some massive Democrat hidden vote that Trump has caused to come out? Seems doubtful.

I became Calvinist in the YRR time. Was difficult being a young Calvinist and not YRR: Those people are just warmed over non-denoms.

1305637571016433665 2020-09-15 06:40:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp The problem is here is that it's going to take profound effort to get this done and I'm just not sure the American people have it in them to stay the course. People are getting fired over this type of thing, though.

1305626028572897282 2020-09-15 05:54:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd I work for 5 hours a week at a Subway. I need a living wage!   One of the dumber things on the right as of late is capitulating to every dumb economic demand of these radical leftists.
1305624721199968258 2020-09-15 05:49:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It is possible for one man to command such a large organization, but only if it were run like a military where commanders have absolute authority over subordinates.
1305624316491563009 2020-09-15 05:47:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is only true of the most restrictive sense of "state power." David Frum wants you to live in 8th grade civics where the President has the executive branch at his command (as he should) despite the fact basic sense tells you that's impossible of such a large organization.
1305622370082869251 2020-09-15 05:40:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer Oh no, it's ALT RIGHT? The horror!  I like how these people never claim you are wrong. They just label it with something.

1305615718961078275 2020-09-15 05:13:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis JK Rowling has been on a redemption arc since she admitted that she fowled it up by shoving Hermione with Ron Weasley. What a joke to anyone who knows how men and women work.
1305615197219028993 2020-09-15 05:11:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd Dragons being really puts a huge hole in the idea the Earth was created/formed billions of years ago. Just think: Dragons and dinosaurs would clearly be related (and they look similar in depictions). That means the fossil record just missed dinos for tens of millions of years.
1305613562715439106 2020-09-15 05:05:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd Notably, the dragon accounts among old world people died out well before the age that modernists claim people were scientifically aware. Like, peasants in the 17th Century didn't run around regularly talking about dragons and it's not like they were scientific skeptics.
1305613235878604800 2020-09-15 05:03:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd I mean, it just seems weird that everyone from very disparate people groups that supposedly diverged tens of thousands of years ago have accounts of giant, dangerous lizard creatures. Native Americans even have them and dragon accounts had largely died out by then.
1305612319225982978 2020-09-15 05:00:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd Dragons are real and universal dragon legends are proof God created the Earth in six literal days less than 10,000 years ago. Also, dinosaurs are dragons.

1305605635506135041 2020-09-15 04:33:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BastGribble @HarmlessYardDog I found the article, there were no details, but it said it was a "4000 person survey," which is highly inadequate for a survey of this kind. The Pew Center usually would use tens of thousands for a survey of this kind and to state breakdowns, you need more than that.
1305604728760537088 2020-09-15 04:29:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Technically, Wyoming doesn't even meet the minimum requirements for a scientific survey. And neither does any state with less than 3.2 million people in their population.
1305604259443101696 2020-09-15 04:28:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SpringToad @BasedLM @NationalistTV I'd prefer it not come to that, but at this point it seems necessary to avoid a worse outcome. Which is when war is just.
1305604050164080645 2020-09-15 04:27:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> OK, I found the source of this and it's actually pretty illustrative of why I don't trust polling. They surveyed 4000 people. No details, but assuming they polled a proportional number in each state, that means the margin of error is as high as 49% for a state (Wyoming).
1305603299450724355 2020-09-15 04:24:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BastGribble @HarmlessYardDog OK: They polled 4,000 people. That means the margin of error in any particular state is crazy. Assuming they polled Nebraska in equal proportion to the rest of the country, the margin of error is 19%.
1305602382710136838 2020-09-15 04:20:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BastGribble @HarmlessYardDog I'm not even sure the methodology was polling.
1305602273779871746 2020-09-15 04:20:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BastGribble @HarmlessYardDog The main problem with all these numbers is they are wildly inconsistent and follow no rational pattern. If it was underreported by a similar degree across the board, this theory makes sense, but given the wild numbers, I think there's a deeper problem with the methodology.
1305595720578326529 2020-09-15 03:54:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Yeah, some skinny dweeb married to a two ton tessy is not aesthetic in any universe.   Us manlet kings married to 6'0 queens? We're just providing better genetics to our children.
1305593565423296517 2020-09-15 03:45:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jamesdkclark I'm not asking you to take a position, but I think our general lack of a narrative on this matter is concerning and leaves us vulnerable to manipulation now.
1305593276590886912 2020-09-15 03:44:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jamesdkclark I don't think it can be doubted that the number of true abolitionists among groups that would later become today's conservative Evangelicals was very limited in the immediate period before the War. This is just something we have to deal with one way or the other.
1305591385672880129 2020-09-15 03:36:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jamesdkclark I'm concerned we have shut down discussion on this and other matters: Too much discussion ends with "well, that's unpopular, so I'm just not going to touch it." Just something to ponder.
1305591269045997570 2020-09-15 03:36:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jamesdkclark Chancel Threader was making an academic point. I doubt he believed he was going to change the whole LCMS's position with some tweets.

1305589014850932736 2020-09-15 03:27:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There are people that actually believe this stuff. They believe what government you choose will prevent all hurricanes, floods, and disease. It's really ridiculous stuff, but that's where we are in our irrational descent to mob rule.
1305588227731009536 2020-09-15 03:24:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @jamesdkclark I don't think the modern illegal human trafficking trade (often for always sinful sex slavery) is necessarily connected to the inherent morality of all systems of slavery.
1305586864766803968 2020-09-15 03:18:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I like how the Dems are trying to meme the Trump depression. It doesn't appear the economy is anywhere near as bad as it could have been. Voting Dem in November will only further kill small business.
1305579579302711296 2020-09-15 02:50:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TitanSteel3 @WickedTewi @Hakasays @realikamusume @SpaceRa76073414 @animegorilla A lot will depend on how a Trump 2nd term goes. I don't think we necessarily will need that if Trump is widely popular going into 2024.  That said, I'm just talking about this from a perspective of who I think is likely to win, not my personal preference.
1305578307732344832 2020-09-15 02:44:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Literally everyone I have ever known from Ohio has owned or at least knows how to shoot a gun. I have never actually known a person from Nebraska very closely.
1305577899479699458 2020-09-15 02:43:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HarmlessYardDog Not buying these numbers. Either a lot of stats are mixed here or they're just really underestimating it in some states. No way more households in DC own legal guns than Ohio.
1305577705954476034 2020-09-15 02:42:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There's a lot of suspicious numbers here. For one thing, the national average is guesstimated at ~40-45%. Might be individuals, as opposed to households, but still seems unlikely in a number of these states, ESPECIALLY Nebraska. Ohio looks really low too.
1305576904905367555 2020-09-15 02:39:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TitanSteel3 @WickedTewi @Hakasays @realikamusume @SpaceRa76073414 @animegorilla That's probably his most effective asset, though. He's not a fighter in the Trump sense, but he's really good at brushing this stuff off. I thought his performance against Kaine was excellent last time. Him and Trump are a yin and yang in this regard.
1305576351722860545 2020-09-15 02:37:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep Like, this is really important. One reason we need to win this election.
1305576272895111172 2020-09-15 02:36:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realkingprep 9th Circuit is one appointment away from flipping totally.

1305574631093473280 2020-09-15 02:30:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot I mean, maybe, but knowing these people personally, they can be borderline irrational.
1305572870395965441 2020-09-15 02:23:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Oregon is a state with a lot of untapped conservative populist voters who are really skeptical of everyone. Very difficult group to win over.
1305570638397087745 2020-09-15 02:14:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TitanSteel3 @WickedTewi @Hakasays @realikamusume @SpaceRa76073414 @animegorilla It really depends on how people take the loss. If traditional conservatives are like "purge all memory of Trump," he's probably not going to make it.
1305570289863004166 2020-09-15 02:13:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TitanSteel3 @WickedTewi @Hakasays @realikamusume @SpaceRa76073414 @animegorilla A chance: Yes. But the odds are significantly reduced from "near shoe in" to a tier 1 contender among other such contenders. I'd still give him an edge given that he can credibly appeal to some Trump voters and more traditional conservatives.
1305569683630886912 2020-09-15 02:10:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Romney got 47.2% of the vote and 60,933,504 votes. Trump got 46.1% of the vote and 62,984,828 votes, more than 2 million more. Those raw votes are real people that turned out to vote for Trump, but not Romney. Getting a landslide in a low turnout election doesn't say much.
1305568153636929536 2020-09-15 02:04:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think raw vote totals matter more than percentage of the vote in terms of long term political trends.

1305566941827026949 2020-09-15 01:59:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WickedTewi @Hakasays @realikamusume @SpaceRa76073414 @animegorilla HW was a one termer because he failed on his promise to be Reagan's third term. The reason Perot got a lot of headway was because people were very uneasy about turning to the Democrats as a solution. Clinton barely outdid Dukakis: That's how unpopular Democratic policies were.
1305564814320832512 2020-09-15 01:51:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nayrASW @HeritageNLegacy @SouthernConsDem Yes, that's the one.

The Dems also have two very distinct factions. The GOP is far more conservative than the Democrats are leftist in their base politics.

It would a sin (I mean that almost literally) if he didn't run.

1305562151155904518 2020-09-15 01:40:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis @kawashima_ami_ Basically. This is why cops are usually only aggressive in enforcing these measures when actual public safety is at risk or to raise revenue in speed trap towns.
1305561836515979266 2020-09-15 01:39:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @nayrASW @HeritageNLegacy @SouthernConsDem Has Donald Trump? Donald Trump =/= the Tea Party. By this standard, Biden is supported by people with much more radical agendas than Trump's people. Think TR would support BLM? He'd consider it an existential threat most likely.

It says that it would include all government health agencies, meaning the infrastructure largely already existed.

1305560402252779525 2020-09-15 01:33:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @kawashima_ami_ 1. Courts do not consider speed limits laws. You can also often challenge posted speed limits because very few of them are posted in accordance with state law.   2. What if the government doesn’t enforce them?
1305559355920732160 2020-09-15 01:29:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @nayrASW @SouthernConsDem Seriously: These things are all basically the law now. The progressive agenda was largely accomplished and what little of it wasn’t became wildly unpopular for a reason. TR wouldn’t insist on failed policies: He was much smarter than that.

Ordinances are only obligatory insofar as they are enforced and conducive to local society. For instance, violating a noise ordinance when no one hears it is irrelevant.

1305520755694866434 2020-09-14 22:56:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III The breaking of bread is meant to be a communal activity.
1305515048505401345 2020-09-14 22:33:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates My apologies.
1305513977561190400 2020-09-14 22:29:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates I read this "it was really a local flood."
1305501262230810630 2020-09-14 21:38:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PrankardShelley @KingFrenly More than 50 really, my grandmother was an IBM engineer 55 years ago and it wasn't like she was the only one. Despite this this is an unusual preference among women. Stop remaking society to fit people who are weird and then we can talk about what the proper course of action is.
1305500547064233987 2020-09-14 21:36:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PrankardShelley @KingFrenly The problem is less with individuals getting jobs and the fact our whole society is structured around girls getting an "equal playing field." Just look at the propaganda when you go to the movies about women in STEM. Girls have been free for 50 years to choose STEM.
1305497897753096197 2020-09-14 21:25:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'd pay money to see this, honestly.
1305497081549856769 2020-09-14 21:22:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Genesis 1:28: "And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."
1305496282488811523 2020-09-14 21:19:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly @PrankardShelley It will be more dystopian than that eventually. And these people just deny the past 50 years have happened and that people are extraordinarily unhappy with this arrangement and it isn’t because we haven’t had enough liberalism.
1305495503375921152 2020-09-14 21:15:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @axegrinder14 It’s just funny how they’ll talk out of both sides of their mouth all the time. One moment they’re telling you this is a dangerous tool. On the other, they’re telling you you’re still powerless with it. It can’t be both ways.
1305493548138221573 2020-09-14 21:08:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PrankardShelley @KingFrenly You’re messing with the biology of 90+% of the population to suit the whims of a group of people that are simply ill-suited to life outside of the modern metropolis. None of these people would survive if it weren’t for the fact we have insulated ourselves from nature.
1305493055525576707 2020-09-14 21:06:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PrankardShelley @KingFrenly The problem is exactly what you want here: the utter makeover of society to suit a slim minority of biologically imbalanced people. Even women who “want” to work often have changes of heart when their kids are actually born because their hormones tell them to stay close.
1305491620641542148 2020-09-14 21:00:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PrankardShelley @KingFrenly Men who want to be homemakers are, in fact, weird, yes. That doesn’t necessarily mean they want to be away from home like modern work has it, but men are traditionally much less attached to the children at the hip, especially the younger ones, and more likely to travel.
1305490839376887811 2020-09-14 20:57:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PrankardShelley @KingFrenly It’s more about spending large amounts of time away from the children. Traditional female roles (which aren’t just what we call homemaking) keep them close to their children. Yes, it’s weird when a woman wants to be regularly separated from her children. As for men...
1305489581157081090 2020-09-14 20:52:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I just love how the left can't help but contradict themselves on even mundane issues.
1305489165308624901 2020-09-14 20:50:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PrankardShelley @KingFrenly You can't run society based around weirdos. Any genuine libertarian individualism also lets people think these people are weirdos. Once again, you're trying to remake society against people's innate tendencies.
1305488769819258880 2020-09-14 20:49:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Anti-Gun People: Ban weapons of war!  Gun people: That's what the 2nd amendment is for!  Also Anti-Gun People: What are you going to do with your AR-15 against the Army, tough guy?!?
1305486926468743168 2020-09-14 20:41:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PrankardShelley @KingFrenly The idea we can just change society so men are happy being nurturers and women are happy away from their children is a fool's errand. You're either attempting to reverse thousands of years of "social conditioning" or the innate nature of the sexes. Probably impossible.
1305486425899651072 2020-09-14 20:39:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PrankardShelley @KingFrenly Feminism can be defined in one of several ways. One of them is the idea men and women are interchangeable. Men are not nurturers by nature. This isn't because it isn't "socially acceptable," it's because this has been the division of labor from time immemorial.
1305479150493487106 2020-09-14 20:10:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly Our social structures were based on our innate natural purposes and tendencies. This idea we can just make it psychologically acceptable for people to do the opposite of what God made them for is insane.
1305346727847899142 2020-09-14 11:24:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates dEMocRaCy!
1305345593682923526 2020-09-14 11:20:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @OrwellNGoode They’re insanely paranoid, that’s what.
1305338559277211648 2020-09-14 10:52:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Noting something about the Romney/Obama &amp; Trump/Biden: If this election pans out the way 2012 did, it really solidifies the blue vs red divide. The opposition that loses the swing states will always react very harshly in their own states to no avail in the battlegrounds.
1305336671139958785 2020-09-14 10:44:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Notably, Romney and McCain ran behind their national averages in states totaling more than 270 electoral votes.  That said, I think your fears here are unwarranted. Even the election analysts have noted the Dems have gained far more support in blue states than swing states.
1305329899624947713 2020-09-14 10:17:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates That's because the outer edges are turning on it. They're either going to crush this insurgency mercilessly and we'll enter a very dark age (of unknown duration) or they will be defeated.
1305322325395615744 2020-09-14 09:47:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LowHangingFrui8 @RedEaglePatriot Except Presidential generals. That I really like showing up day of. It's an experience.
1305322201177034752 2020-09-14 09:47:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LowHangingFrui8 @RedEaglePatriot I normally vote early in person. I trust that much more than I trust the USPS.
1305320726497570816 2020-09-14 09:41:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot "Everything I don't like is racist." These people are such clowns. Completely intellectually bankrupt. All they can do is repeat slogans they've come to believe far too much.
1305320268768960512 2020-09-14 09:39:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis That's why we need to cut the spigot. I think we can slowly integrate the Latinos and eventually they might be on board.
1305318956346073088 2020-09-14 09:34:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis I think we should use the Biblical standard and you don't achieve full citizenship rights until you've lived here for three generation. So your grandpa had to be born here and then you can apply when you're a functioning adult.
1305317190732853248 2020-09-14 09:27:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis Not sure about Muslims, but immigrants really take a long time to assimilate and I think it has to be far more intentional than we do today. Most Irish and Italians have integrated now, but there's still that branch that never got over it.
1305313993104523265 2020-09-14 09:14:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis The Democrats are still able to get a lot of those people to vote for them by appealing to the "Nation of Immigrants" line. Note that the Democrats never welcomed these people in their own states in the Solid South in significant numbers.
1305311738418671617 2020-09-14 09:05:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis I don't even understand why they do this. Their arguments are utterly terrible for it. We have a million legal immigrants a year to this country. We could hardly get more if we tried. We'd have to show up and offer free passage.
1305308559396274177 2020-09-14 08:53:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis He says he wants to "make it easier." I really can't imagine increasing legal immigration: We already have the floodgates open unless you have literally no connections here at all. In any case, individual Senators have very little power on this.
1305307523767992322 2020-09-14 08:48:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacksonPackson1 @wallsberg @RedEaglePatriot A lot of polls Have Trump behind Biden on Law &amp; Order. It's just difficult to pinpoint how this is impacting the race or how it makes any sense.
1305306283298480130 2020-09-14 08:44:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @wallsberg @JacksonPackson1 @RedEaglePatriot A lot of polls have been saying this. It's really quite baffling given the bumps Trump gets whenever there's a riot in town. Quite frankly, the Dem messaging on the BLM thing is so all over, it's crazy.
1305305406793805826 2020-09-14 08:40:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot It was limited to MN and blue states, but it spreading to a lot of other swing states is really bad news for Dems, especially with their local inaction and bluster when Trump offers help while their cities burn.
1305303099846860801 2020-09-14 08:31:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GrayConnolly @mrsdzt These people know asking for a raise at work is altering their employment contract, right? Deals are always open to renegotiation.
1305301791513481226 2020-09-14 08:26:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LewisCallum @RedEaglePatriot I mean, being a part of a big win is exciting. People still remember going to cast their votes for Reagan in 1984 and tuning in to watch that beautiful map get painted red and that was 36 years ago now.
1305301508834111488 2020-09-14 08:25:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot I know it's a tall order, but I just feel this map is the best chance we have of avoiding a terrible consequence to this election:  https://t.co/FX71LWeEjE
1305300285888311297 2020-09-14 08:20:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot @LewisCallum I don't get why you say this: No one was ever discouraged for voting for the President because of landslide potential. Reagan was ahead by nearly 20 points in the final poll and he matched it everyone knew Reagan was a shoe in by October.
1305299946393010176 2020-09-14 08:18:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LewisCallum @RedEaglePatriot I hope so.
1305299433719050241 2020-09-14 08:16:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis Can always challenge him in a primary later on. People have gotten a lot happier about ousting unpopular incumbents in primaries for ideological transgressions.
1305299190113865729 2020-09-14 08:15:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis I mean, it's better than Peters. I'm confident he'll be a reliable vote: McConnell has that caucus well organized.
1305298997188472837 2020-09-14 08:15:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy I think this pandemic and the way they played it will come back to bite them in the ass: That's a reason they might avoid debates even without Biden's problems. They want to have their cake and eat it too on the issue and put Trump in a Catch-22 over a natural disaster.
1305298306826985472 2020-09-14 08:12:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PrimetimePurity @RedEaglePatriot Seems likely Trump will overperform McSally. I really hope he can drag her across the finish line. I don't really see how someone votes for Donald Trump and Mark Kelly. People keep saying he's an amazing candidate, but I think it's more that McSally is uniquely uninspiring.
1305297018999447554 2020-09-14 08:07:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot The GOP appears to be on an upswing there. Hopefully they can drag Trump across the finish line.
1305294470892617728 2020-09-14 07:57:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CursedModernism Since when is City Council high office? I mean, San Francisco is an important city and all, but it's hardly "high office."
1305294311437856768 2020-09-14 07:56:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> That might be the most cursed image I've ever seen in a very literal sense.
1305293227994603520 2020-09-14 07:52:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NeverForget6Bil If by "based" you mean "Tim Scott of the North," I guess.
1305292525683511296 2020-09-14 07:49:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> If John James wins in Michigan, I hope Jason Lewis also wins in Minnesota. John James has terrible immigration and trade positions while Jason Lewis is pretty good on both.
1305284284496908288 2020-09-14 07:16:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 Same could be said for West Virginia in reverse. Lots of hunting in Vermont, I think. Also, in a rural area, you need guns just to deal with pests. Even the Soviets let rural peasants own guns for these purposes.
1305275811449262081 2020-09-14 06:42:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So many people have become water carriers for an elite we all knew was corrupt pre-Trump because Trump says mean things about it. It's really quite bizarre.
1305273294707470337 2020-09-14 06:32:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Hardly even a dark horse now. On a good night, might see an even Senate or possibly +1 GOP with AL+MN+MI flips and losses in AZ, CO, and possibly NC. If the GOP does better than that, I'd be pretty surprised, but it's not impossible.
1305270932953600001 2020-09-14 06:23:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Amazing how jealous people get of success. This is no different than dweebs insulting the HS QB for getting women.
1305269269693857797 2020-09-14 06:16:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Circlek8211 @GrayConnolly Incest is kind of in there right now. Polygamy is far too traditional for these clowns.
1305269147207692288 2020-09-14 06:16:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis @RedEaglePatriot Democrats used to run on this crap all the time. They were the "Buy American" party for like two decades while Repubs were busy on their lolbert odyssey. Never did jack crap about it. Instead they wasted their political capital TWICE on unpopular healthcare measures.
1305268085297942528 2020-09-14 06:12:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> No we ain't!
1305267629746278400 2020-09-14 06:10:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot I think he had 48% approval, right? Like, that isn't bad for how awful the night appeared to go. Even more NeverTrump types have come around since then.
1305265926980460544 2020-09-14 06:03:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III Just imagine you’re some big smarty pants for equating some rednecks beating some random Paki at the bar to a coordinated terrorist plot.
1305264247329484803 2020-09-14 05:57:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd Is the guy on the right Charlie Baker? He’s not even popular among NeverTrumpers. He’s like “he’s the best we got who can win Mass.”

1305250458748018695 2020-09-14 05:02:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The crime bill was bad because because of the magazine ban, not the fact a bunch of cops were put on the streets. Arm yourself!
1305249875764948992 2020-09-14 04:59:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III Yes, but we need to seize on their more brazen sexualization attempts in things like Cuties to point to why these things are bad. The “slipper slope is a fallacy!” is losing credibility fast. Need to hold the line on these issues to protect the children in the next war.

1305248732951257090 2020-09-14 04:55:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @GrayConnolly I was informed I was a crackpot conspiracy theorist to believe pedophilia is part of the agenda.
1305247442020061189 2020-09-14 04:50:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat I will fight. Sorry, no surrender to these punks.
1305246533504434178 2020-09-14 04:46:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @semaj_drof @trueaspenblue The war was more caused by the fact the preceding election was obviously rigged (this was documented by foreign powers) and they used the very narrow, rigged result as a mandate to murder kulak class farmers. The religious persecution started when the war did for the most part.
1305245523713159173 2020-09-14 04:42:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @rievaulx_ I’d argue colonisation is far better: Empires can respect local ethnicities and cultures. Modern mass migration is built on a denial of these thing and mass cultural disintegration.

1305236208600186881 2020-09-14 04:05:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @softsuthernwind And it’s like: To what effect? Africa isn’t infested with White liberalism: Maybe she should move there?
1305232348808654849 2020-09-14 03:50:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WVPitt @IVMiles And Russell Kirk is really an introduction. People like David French are beyond not reading these people for lack of time or interest, though. They’re genuinely suspicious of you have read and agree with them.
1305231726910767104 2020-09-14 03:47:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @softsuthernwind A battalion!
1305231269782052869 2020-09-14 03:45:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @WVPitt @IVMiles It’s really unfortunate how “barren of depth” it really is. This is because a lot of these people are genuinely afraid of being a deep conservative thinker. That means reading people who are positively anathema in the modern intelligentsia and they’d rather just forget them.
1305229883749158920 2020-09-14 03:40:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation @BoozyBlair Most people with diabetes don’t take care of themselves. Still eat like shit. Don’t take their insulin when they should. If you take care of yourself even a little, you can still live a full life.
1305229060654747649 2020-09-14 03:37:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @limitedholmes71 @RedEaglePatriot 42% is pretty good for a Republican among Hispanics. Nearly Bush numbers.
1305227727486816258 2020-09-14 03:31:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume I really feel Minnesota is happening. I know people who have been up in the Iron Range since Trump took office and that place has really turned around.
1305227316713451526 2020-09-14 03:30:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation That’s the problem with a lot of these reverse discrimination lawsuits: They’ll probably have the effect of further hindering Whites because of how much Asians over perform and you know they’ll find a way to sneak in affirmative action for Blacks and Latinos.
1305226121135509504 2020-09-14 03:25:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThomasTorsan @RedEaglePatriot GOP bench in Arizona is pretty shallow.
1305224934998847489 2020-09-14 03:20:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DatOneG30640581 @RedEaglePatriot FNC has had some of the worst Trump polls since 2016. Like, consistently below average.
1305224788772818956 2020-09-14 03:20:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Cyclically, we could probably get the Hispanics on board by going full IDPol against the Blacks. I don’t support this for a variety of reasons, but it probably would work better than the Jeb Bush idea of how to appeal to Hispanics.
1305223898766680066 2020-09-14 03:16:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChancelThreader Sick of all this “let’s slap something I don’t like with an -ism and then my opponents don’t even get to argue.” Very worldly.
1305223172925554690 2020-09-14 03:13:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation I think GOP gets respectable double digits among married blacks. This is just an incredibly rare breed.
1305221898528321537 2020-09-14 03:08:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Wyoming is grey. This is because no one lives there. Wouldn’t move there unless you’re interested in livestock.
1305221567094427650 2020-09-14 03:07:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy If you don’t enjoy the company of women, you’re a fag. Just don’t get these people who like to spend their time bitching about potential mates online.
1305220754271764480 2020-09-14 03:04:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There are 11 states where single people vote GOP. Probably nice places to move to find women.

1305217420181811202 2020-09-14 02:50:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Democrats always do this shit. I fricken hate it. They’ve been doing it for decades.
1305217193337028609 2020-09-14 02:50:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AgainCav Not sure if you have it in the UK, but in the US, they used to broadcast everyone who turned 100+’s birthday every morning. Occasionally they’d interview one who was like 105 and they always were a drinker and had some other weird habits.
1305216843058155520 2020-09-14 02:48:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation Latin migration still threatens our identity, just in a less immediately political way. I do think if we shut down immigration, it isn’t so far gone right now and they’d eventually assimilate. I’m also more concerned about Asians (all Asians) than Latinos or even Africans.
1305215793324589056 2020-09-14 02:44:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AgainCav It’s the Scotch. Drink a glass a day with a cigar and you’ll live to be a centenarian.
1305176251829809152 2020-09-14 00:07:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @oblivionrecurs Pretty typical. Usually the disapprovers vote for the incumbent 5%.

1305013809032105988 2020-09-13 13:21:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Blue98705683 @RedEaglePatriot It isn’t “playing soft” to secure the battlegrounds first. When Obama “expanded the map” (which he didn’t do very well), he had already secured the battleground states. And Trump is clearly campaigning in Nevada.

1305011950896766977 2020-09-13 13:14:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Blue98705683 @RedEaglePatriot New Jersey is the next state after Colorado or Virginia to fall. Trump is already campaigning everywhere short of New Jersey.
1305011541360730112 2020-09-13 13:12:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Blue98705683 @RedEaglePatriot Expand into what? What message? Indiana's 2008 vote was a fluke. Also: 2008 was the first time Missouri voted for the loser in 100 years: Obama's failure to win there was a big deal. Montana has 3 electoral votes: It was a curiosity he got close.
1305010995786637312 2020-09-13 13:10:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon Something to be said for it, but even with it, they didn't really get that many people out to vote that election. 45 million for Clinton, 39 million for Bush, and Perot got nearly 20. In Gallup, Perot hit 39% with an 8 point lead. He could have done it if he kept the energy up.
1305010560619229185 2020-09-13 13:08:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Blue98705683 @RedEaglePatriot 2008 is just the map you expect from a Democrat winning by 8 points nationally in 1968. The last time someone tried your strategy (without actually winning a 49 state landslide) was in 1968. That's how dumb your strategy is.
1305010177381486600 2020-09-13 13:07:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Blue98705683 @RedEaglePatriot Obama didn't win anywhere terribly shocking besides Indiana, which neighbors two purplish states and Obama's own home state. It was mostly just a really high water mark for Democrats. You clearly don't know what you're talking about.
1305009745657503744 2020-09-13 13:05:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IanBurkePerry1 The fact the challenger won 1992 with a 3rd Party candidate running a clown campaign getting nearly 20% of the vote undermines this notion. I think Perot himself would have won, or at least thrown it to the House, if he didn't drop out. Bush got 37% of the vote as the incumbent.
1305008351772901376 2020-09-13 13:00:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon Perot's problem I think was that his campaign was an utter shitshow. Given the polls, it looked like people really didn't like Bush, but we were still really high on Reagan at the time and turning to a Democrat really seemed like a betrayal.
1305007922943057921 2020-09-13 12:58:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @quintfilius LMAO: When I was in the Middle East, this chick got really turned on when I just mentioned being interested in picking up the hobby. Of course, I think she was just into me.
1305007113312317441 2020-09-13 12:55:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @quintfilius LMAO. Are they Muslim? Muslims with a dog is just a dumb idea. Their natural pets are falcons (pretty cool hobby, btw).
1305006787184209922 2020-09-13 12:53:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Thoughts on this? I really think the system was healthy enough in 1992 a shock like this might have led to a more stable course. Also could have been done in 2000 or 2008, I think, but more difficult by 2008.
1305005041493905408 2020-09-13 12:47:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @quintfilius I remember some Muslims moved in across the street from one of my friends (this is pre-9/11) and my friend's mom had a conniption fit over what I now know to be an iftar dinner they held in the driveway. Real trashy thing to do at the time: Eat in the driveway like that.
1305004657065029633 2020-09-13 12:45:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @quintfilius I was actually thinking about this: I think if you replace Ross Perot with Donald Trump in the 1992 race and he runs his 2016 campaign plus some Perot-style budget stuff, I think he wins and the country was sane enough then he could have gotten the agenda passed.
1305003449235447808 2020-09-13 12:40:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @quintfilius It's the whole damn country now. Only place you can go is like Wyoming and even then the gas station will be owned by them.
1305003305643511810 2020-09-13 12:40:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @quintfilius To be fair, they shouldn't have voted for Grey Davis. Of course, Dan Lungren was a horrible nominee.
1305002987736227841 2020-09-13 12:38:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @quintfilius They're gross. This is why California Republicans are still pretty conservative on this question: They know from first hand experience that the Jeb Bush idea of recruiting them as "natural conservatives" is a fool's errand.
1305002597737271297 2020-09-13 12:37:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @quintfilius The thing that really gets me about this whole situation is that we tried. California Whites have been anti-immigration literally since statehood. So much energy was exerted to implore the Federal government to do something about this problem and eventually the dam just broke.
1305001998023118848 2020-09-13 12:34:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @quintfilius We moved from the Bay Area to the Central Valley. We determined we had to leave when we couldn't escape all the Indians even there.
1305001795916308481 2020-09-13 12:34:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @quintfilius They really just need to leave and their homes given back to whatever family had to move to Arizona to escape the (now literaly) hellscape the state has become.
1305000522039070723 2020-09-13 12:29:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @quintfilius I read somewhere that half of the immigrants to the US go to California.
1305000353000239105 2020-09-13 12:28:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @quintfilius The problem is that it was too blessed and attracts an insane number of foreign immigrants. Between the tech giants importing Asians, farmers importing illegals, and SoCal importing legal Hispanics, it didn't stand a chance.
1304998649903153152 2020-09-13 12:21:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @quintfilius I mean, he was still well below the national average in the state. I'd be willing to bet my grandfather was one of them, though, lol.  Seriously, it's just really sad what has happened there, especially the last 20 years. A whole way of life just destroyed.
1304994447743242241 2020-09-13 12:04:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Apparently 151K of them were in Los Angeles.
1304993547028959232 2020-09-13 12:01:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> In 1968, 487,270 people turned out to vote for George Wallace in California. Just a different world.
1304992670633385985 2020-09-13 11:57:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Blue98705683 @RedEaglePatriot The election would have went to the House, Republicans controlled 17 delegations, and Wallace likely would have had enough support among Southern Conservative Democrats to deny Humphrey a majority of states.
1304992250691190786 2020-09-13 11:56:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Blue98705683 @RedEaglePatriot He won 5 states and was within 5 points of Nixon in South Carolina and Tennessee. He was about 8 points behind in North Carolina. If he had won those three states, instead of wasting time in New York and California, Nixon would have gotten 269 electoral votes.
1304989127587360773 2020-09-13 11:43:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Blue98705683 @RedEaglePatriot Bunk. Wallace chose this strategy in 1968 quite stupidly. If he would have spent his time in states he could have won, he was within striking distance of Nixon in 3 states that put him over the top (and thus would have denied Nixon a majority and thrown it to the House).
1304986619456434180 2020-09-13 11:33:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @biscottimelange We'll see how they want to play it pretty soon after election. Honestly, if I was a moderate Democrat who didn't want to go along with this insanity, I'd consider helping rig the popular vote in Trump's favor if Trump is a lock on the swing states. Only way to calm people down.
1304983853694681088 2020-09-13 11:22:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @biscottimelange There's only so much more they can squeeze out of the urban districts than they did last time. It would be enough to make the difference in 2016 I think (unless they were already maxed out), but might not be enough now. Could sway the popular vote, though, but that's dangerous.
1304983580515414016 2020-09-13 11:21:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @biscottimelange It really depends on how big Trump of a lead Trump can get outside of the urban cores. Democrats don't have the infrastructure to do much fraud in rural and most suburban counties in swing states. If Trump gets Ohio-level margins in enough states, nothing Dems can do.
1304981418968256514 2020-09-13 11:13:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @scythyphus @PiousTusks Like, if you're looting, and property isn't real, is it yours? Like, can't I just take it later? If property isn't real, what's the difference between a home and a goods storehouse (a "store")? I can't believe this shit is coming back from the dead.
1304978975702298630 2020-09-13 11:03:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CursedModernism I found the race I'd vote Democrat in.
1304978750606635009 2020-09-13 11:02:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks "Property is a lie." Opinion dismissed.
1304978467780468736 2020-09-13 11:01:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @john_bieder1 @RedEaglePatriot That's "reasonable Trump high water."
1304978114829791233 2020-09-13 11:00:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 2/2 It is also quite possible Trump does this in swing states and nowhere else, kind of like what happened in 2016. Could see a really weird electoral alignment due to just how hated Trump is in blue states, especially blue state elites (college educated Whites in those states).
1304977736335851520 2020-09-13 10:58:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Really, all Trump needs to do right now to get break his 2016 numbers is get college Whites and the 65+ to come home. If they come home by November 3rd, Trump would certainly win and quite possible walk away with the popular vote. 1/2
1304975032318337024 2020-09-13 10:47:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RealAntonioJT @RedEaglePatriot It's good because Republicans still lead in the county by about 52,000. Dems need Maricopa to win the state.
1304973420975788032 2020-09-13 10:41:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JacobCLloyd Only Japanese get to kill themselves and not be losers. And only if done by sepuku.
1304972728097701889 2020-09-13 10:38:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Any sane democracy would ban polling. It does literally nothing for public discourse.
1304972607679352833 2020-09-13 10:38:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Then there's the poll that had a "0.5%" margin of error. I mean, just lmao. I'm becoming convinced the whole thing is a psyop.
1304972161640267778 2020-09-13 10:36:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot I leave this for the educated reader:  https://t.co/SE7ZMWRiMO
1304971556993597440 2020-09-13 10:33:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation PPP still had Feingold up by 5 a week out.
1304971294702739456 2020-09-13 10:32:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation 3 weeks out from the election and all these polls had Feingold up, 4 over 50% (including a poll with a "0.5%" MoE) and Johnson won by 3.5%.
1304970663581671425 2020-09-13 10:30:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> lol...+/-0.5%. This whole thing is a joke.
1304970436904652800 2020-09-13 10:29:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChelenaDrew @RedEaglePatriot Perhaps, but I don't really think this would make a huge difference unless every candidate up and down the ballot was massively exciting.
1304969328719265792 2020-09-13 10:25:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> What is this race and who won it?  https://t.co/oIrs65ArxO
1304968539745513472 2020-09-13 10:21:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChelenaDrew @RedEaglePatriot Because they don't like the Senator, they're not going to turn out to vote for the PRESIDENT of the United States? I can't think of a single instance where this happened. Also, Kelly does have flaws: His views on gun control are far to the left of Arizona.

1304950811441668096 2020-09-13 09:11:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis HRE was a far less centralized state.
1304949808231256065 2020-09-13 09:07:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis It waxed and waned in enforcement, but it wasn’t like there was mass state repression.
1304948747743506432 2020-09-13 09:03:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis France didn’t start persecuting Protestants until the late 17th Century because of a religious awakening Louis XIV underwent.

Extremely effective and suppressing college educated and upper middle class Trump support.

1304934875175231488 2020-09-13 08:08:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Anyonebutthede1 @CKaliszeski @RedEaglePatriot It’s not really that bad. He lost by 200,000 votes. Yes, the margin in Fairfax is bad, but narrowing it does a lot statewide and I doubt GOP turnout was maxed in rural counties and Richmond suburbs in 2016.
1304934140416991235 2020-09-13 08:05:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Sakurak38915749 @Balthazar003 Adam and Eve didn’t know good and evil in the sense that they were incapable of understanding the full panoply of sin and evil we experience. It doesn’t mean they didn’t have any concept it was wrong to disobey God.
1304933627680219136 2020-09-13 08:03:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Sakurak38915749 @Balthazar003 This still isn’t a “logical contradiction.” A contradiction is affirming something and denying it at the same time and in the same relationship. It’s also just wrong. They didn’t “know good and evil,” but they did receive a command they understood and disobeyed.
1304929590729678849 2020-09-13 07:47:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CKaliszeski @RedEaglePatriot It’s just low on the priority list IMO. If things are looking bright in October, he should spend more here.
1304929167369293825 2020-09-13 07:45:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CKaliszeski @RedEaglePatriot Lose by less than 5 seems likely at least. It’s still hard for him to win the state.

1304927876253446144 2020-09-13 07:40:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CKaliszeski @RedEaglePatriot It was hella blue in 2016 because it’s the only place NeverTrumpers exist. I expect he’ll get like 35% to his 28 last time.
1304926863651995648 2020-09-13 07:36:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CKaliszeski @RedEaglePatriot Still don’t expect him to win here, but perhaps overpeform last election.
1304926711096672263 2020-09-13 07:35:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CKaliszeski @RedEaglePatriot Fairfax. A lot of Never Trump types coming around in my circles.
1304926272741670914 2020-09-13 07:34:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CKaliszeski @RedEaglePatriot I live in Virginia and I’m getting more bullish. Seeing more Trump support than last time
1304926111957241857 2020-09-13 07:33:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot He also collects a disproportionate amount of cash and it’s right next to Arizona. Low effort with potentially high payoff

1304904381419188224 2020-09-13 06:07:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChelenaDrew @RedEaglePatriot I was talking about Trump being an incumbent.

1304896197409353735 2020-09-13 05:34:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realikamusume Just think about this: Nearly 70,000 people in Multnomah County, Oregon voted for Trump. Would you know that walking around town? You’d swear there wasn’t a Trump supporters in the whole county. Same could be said in many urban and suburban counties.
1304893942052327425 2020-09-13 05:25:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChelenaDrew @RedEaglePatriot This usually works in reverse, especially for incumbents.

1304857933566619650 2020-09-13 03:02:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheHidingGhost @SouthernConsDem I don’t think any form of anarchism works long term. The AnCaps support “private security firms” which would eventually just become armies and governments. The anarchist part is a mirage for what these groups actually want.
1304857006281576455 2020-09-13 02:58:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’ve never been a conspiracy theorist, but something is clearly up when they claim you’re some kind of crackpot for opposing the sexualization of minors.
1304856716090191872 2020-09-13 02:57:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Apparently opposing pedos is now “QAnon.”

They inevitably have to come up with some kind of currency, which inevitably would lead to some kind of market, and everything just starts back over.
1304853352749191168 2020-09-13 02:44:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheHidingGhost @SouthernConsDem They believe government is what artificially props up the upper class’s ability to maintain property. They believe without government, the workers would own the means of production.

The growth of the Christian movement is testimony in itself. We can trace the Christian confession to 30s Jerusalem. 3. Those Gospels contradict the Old Testament. In addition, they are late.

1304846572660944896 2020-09-13 02:17:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Looking into this a bit more, it seems the last time a President underperformed his approval rating in their re-election attempt was Clinton, which he still won. Everyone else in recent memory has overperformed it by a few points, including both Bushes, Obama, and Reagan.
1304840117668937729 2020-09-13 01:51:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Approval and eventual support track pretty well for incumbents. Trump only needs like 47% to win I think. In Arizona maybe 48-50.

1304822857160105984 2020-09-13 00:43:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp It’s funny watching Irish and Italian conservatives (I haven’t followed this argument, so I don’t know if she fits that) turn into lefties over Catholic immigration. “You’re just an anti-Catholic bigot!” That’s how they got White Catholics to vote Dem for so long.

1304640456073121793 2020-09-12 12:38:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ribdisrespecter @SirDowden @AnimeBibleVerse The only fool here is you: The passage is talking about the origins and fruits of unbelief. One of which is the sin of homosexuality.
1304639108669636608 2020-09-12 12:32:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ribdisrespecter @AnimeBibleVerse Of course, homosexuality is a symptom more like blood in the stool than a cough, but it still could have multiple origins, and not all of them are “he’s doomed.”
1304638855396626432 2020-09-12 12:31:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ribdisrespecter @AnimeBibleVerse You’re right: It’s a symptom. However, symptoms don’t work the way you’re making it. Having a cough could mean you have a cold or it could mean you have stage 4 lung cancer. Same with sin.
1304638387446571008 2020-09-12 12:30:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ribdisrespecter @AnimeBibleVerse Yes, you’re just saying that no one who does it gets pardoned. Totally different.
1304638218613260288 2020-09-12 12:29:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ribdisrespecter @AnimeBibleVerse It says abusers of themselves with mankind, which implies homosexuality, in I Cor. 6:9 (as well as the effeminate, which implies crossdressers/trans as we would call them).
1304637849447403520 2020-09-12 12:27:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ribdisrespecter @AnimeBibleVerse Christ proclaimed only one sin unpardonable, and it was not homosexuality. Christ’s blood avails for all sins but one.
1304637588490407936 2020-09-12 12:26:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ribdisrespecter @AnimeBibleVerse This happens to some people, but you’re making a blanket assumption about the causes and effects of homosexuality that are unjustified based off a false, logically invalid, inference. Paul says some of the  Corinthians were homosexuals in I Cor. 6:11.
1304635343950483458 2020-09-12 12:17:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ribdisrespecter @SirDowden @AnimeBibleVerse It’s obviously talking about reprobates, but you’re falsely using it as some kind of scientific formula to determine who is reprobate. The Bible has some awful things to say about all sinners, but the Gospel is that Christ fame to save sinners.
1304634552762200065 2020-09-12 12:14:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ribdisrespecter @AnimeBibleVerse This doesn’t mean God could never possibly forgive the sin of homosexuality.

1304281256872554496 2020-09-11 12:50:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates You can go in and sign the ballot if the signature was rejected.
1304277979372105729 2020-09-11 12:37:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot America wouldn’t survive without immigrants? Earth hasn’t had immigrants in a while and it seems to be doing ok...  What even is the point of a dumb statement like that? These people can’t think of second order consequences.
1304276452393844736 2020-09-11 12:31:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Do people not care about voting when you’re re-electing the Mayor for the 6th time and everyone knows he’s a shoe-in for re-election? Yes. President? No.
1304276105201963008 2020-09-11 12:30:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot My objection to this is that no one has ever been discouraged from voting by potentially participating in a Presidential landslide.

1304257072612233218 2020-09-11 11:14:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation I'm not an engineer, but it's crazy to me screwing up a pedestrian bridge is even possible like this. Like, you'd think diversity hires would be able to do it with minimal supervision just by following a set formula.
1304255736827056129 2020-09-11 11:09:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat Well, considering the Historicist view declares the Pope to be the Beast of Revelation, I'd imagine that would go over too fondly in the Vatican.
1304255190128898048 2020-09-11 11:07:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ByzCat Wait, that's acceptable for the Catholics?

1304192738024456193 2020-09-11 06:59:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> They are rigging this election and the only thing that can stop it is a horde of incredibly honest poll workers in the Midwest combined with hordes of Trump voters.

1304190679254532097 2020-09-11 06:51:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou There wasn’t for a single moment where they said “look, Trump is going to be the President for the next 4 years, we hope he is successful.” Not even Obama said that. That alone tells you everything.
1304190341726244865 2020-09-11 06:49:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou I don’t recall specifics, but they definitely made noises that way. Especially the doctrinaires they invite on.
1304190111807156227 2020-09-11 06:48:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I remember the story on that being he betrayed his base after he did little more than that.
1304189407830978561 2020-09-11 06:46:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I’ve never seen such imbalanced coverage and from day 1 of the campaign too. They literally are constitutionally incapable of crediting him with anything good.
1304184538965442562 2020-09-11 06:26:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @danwolfgang_ I honestly believe this. Trump needs more mandate.
1304184371281358850 2020-09-11 06:25:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III She has a point in that many women can look attractive into their 40s, but after 50 desirability drops off a cliff even compared to that. You're never going to see guys clamoring around women in their 40s unless it's purely for recreational purposes to put it politely, though.

1304163714736828418 2020-09-11 05:03:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LowHangingFrui8 @RedEaglePatriot Remember all the agencies that Ohio as Lean D before 2016? That was hilarious when results started poring in and it was obvious Trump was crushing it there.
1304163497933254656 2020-09-11 05:03:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Looking forward to the Red Mirage followed by the subsequent coup attempt. Gonna be tons o' fun. Import the third world. Get the third world. Including coups! Score!
1304161935861198848 2020-09-11 04:56:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot They had Florida as Lean D? No wonder these people have become a joke.

1304140041724334084 2020-09-11 03:29:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Apparently it was Mike Castle. Got those two confused.
1304137673578360832 2020-09-11 03:20:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IRussell729 @SouthernConsDem I'm not sure if there's any GOP membership in the country left that's moderate.
1304136935406010370 2020-09-11 03:17:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @adrelmn @SouthernConsDem What about any of the elected officials? The grassroots doesn't seem that bad, but Trump ran in many ways as a moderate. He was sort of a moderate that appealed to a frustrated conservative base.
1304136225591308290 2020-09-11 03:14:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SouthernConsDem Massachusetts by far. Conservatism basically doesn't exist in that GOP as far as state or local officials go.
1304136058372870144 2020-09-11 03:14:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SouthernConsDem @karrnine As a native California, California GOP is very conservative.
1304135825949700099 2020-09-11 03:13:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Only reason Delaware didn't have an R Senator to replace Biden was because Christine O'Donnell (who was a terrible candidate beyond her stances on the issues) defeated the popular Darrell Castle in the primary in 2010. Castle was a total RINO, though.

1304104896732508162 2020-09-11 01:10:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot @heyisthatjordan There's also the fact Dems usually have an advantage in this because young voters are the largest group of entirely new registrants and they've always trended D. Honestly, I'm shocked PA is that close in this metric.
1304096650487648257 2020-09-11 00:37:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Stoner_68 As if ear ticklers don't exist in Rome or Constantinople? This is a people problem, not a Protestantism problem.
1304093694530916355 2020-09-11 00:25:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Stoner_68 So?
1304092937467228160 2020-09-11 00:22:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @VeriteJacques I don't even know what chart you're looking at if you're just not that well informed about Evangelical vs. Mainline Protestantism.
1304089796139266055 2020-09-11 00:10:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Stoner_68 For what? The Bible already condemns all of this. The Bible is the sole infallible rule of faith.
1304089673283842049 2020-09-11 00:09:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Stoner_68 @CidreLecker So, you don't actually believe in it?
1304071660774060033 2020-09-10 22:58:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart Yeah, in my experience the people identifying as Evangelical are practicing a lot more. The main contrast I'm looking at is Mainline vs. Evangelical, not Prot vs. Catholic.
1304070796776812545 2020-09-10 22:54:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Stoner_68 No.
1304065356957392897 2020-09-10 22:33:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> So, the driving factor behind atheism is liberal Protestantism. To the shock of exactly no one.

1303896712411574278 2020-09-10 11:22:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I think mid 40s might be a new approval standard. Obama and Trump have been hovering there forever.
1303894078074032129 2020-09-10 11:12:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly Normally I don’t say this because it’s anti-White rhetoric, but she looks like a ghost.

1303882058612301825 2020-09-10 10:24:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Wars have a tendency to change people's minds about things. Such as Northern Abolitionism.

1303862990014480385 2020-09-10 09:08:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Yeah, I don’t see any of those states being up grabs under Biden besides a really good candidate in NC with a bad GOP candidate. At least three would be open for the GOP in a Biden Admin, possibly 6 or 7. This is a stable map, overall, though.

1303853797593296896 2020-09-10 08:32:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation This is a long standing Anglo tradition. It’s a subtle of way saying you disapprove of the administration while remaining loyal to the administration’s objectives itself.
1303853161912905729 2020-09-10 08:29:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I retweeted a thread earlier about wartime conservatives vs peace conservatives and immunity to leftist labels. This just proves you also need immunity to the bad ideas of peace conservatives.

Yeah, people don't age like that without doing it to themselves. Your appearance shouldn't be wrecked like that from 21-26. Usually your late 20s to early 30s will be your peak attractiveness as a man.

1303774540795973632 2020-09-10 03:17:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @oblivionrecurs I don't think these numbers are terribly unusual.

1303771139810955270 2020-09-10 03:03:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RyanGirdusky The Biden numbers: Divide by about a thousand and you're almost there, but not really.
1303752604216946690 2020-09-10 01:50:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Oregon 4 is so weird. How does one vote for Peter DeFazio and Donald Trump? Some people did that in 2016.
1303745798161735683 2020-09-10 01:23:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This has been the standard liberal line forever. Biden hasn't gotten the memo they're supposed to be flat out pro-drug use now.

1303539872725110784 2020-09-09 11:44:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates @BenSasse It sounds like the ultimate classical liberal solution to our problems: Let’s add some more constitutional weirdness and maybe that will fix things? Like, just get over the fact your project is failed.
1303539242199650304 2020-09-09 11:42:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I can’t imagine a more bizarre proposal on any level. One 12 year term with no cameras around and no committee investigations? Forcing Senators to spend most of their time isolated from their families and the rest of the world. @BenSasse Resign, you’re insane.
1303538666770436098 2020-09-09 11:40:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation One 12 year term is worse than term limits with one or two re-elections possible.

1303534219218628608 2020-09-09 11:22:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReactionaryIan The main reason it happened is because everyone figured we were going to lose anyway, so they didn’t really care to fight it out.

1303464868218052608 2020-09-09 06:46:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @oblivionrecurs That’s worst news than it appears on the surface because that is also the demo least likely to vote and I’d guess most likely to give a false preference.
1303454188018561024 2020-09-09 06:04:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Racism_truth @BeigeShiba That was the height of mass media influence.
1303453701407817728 2020-09-09 06:02:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba That seems unlikely. 1988 seems like the cap in a dream scenario even. I still think median scenario is a 2016 repeat minus Michigan or Pennsylvania.
1303453102880808961 2020-09-09 06:00:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Racism_truth @BeigeShiba A lot of unreasonable hate for Nixon out there back then.

Trump’s strategy leaves him a lot of options for a surprise election night victory. This could change by election night, but taking Florida off the map is not good.
1303451701635153930 2020-09-09 05:54:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Also, his comments about cops today reek of desperation more than senility.
1303451202684882947 2020-09-09 05:52:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The fact Biden isn’t contesting Florida right now should tip people off. Without Florida on the map for him, his path is really, really narrow.
1303448859012665346 2020-09-09 05:43:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There's so much cope going on in left wing Twitter every time a state poll showing Trump doing well comes out. We really could see a race where Trump is defeated by 7-8 points in the PV and wins the EV right now. So much of the D surge is coming from solid blue states.
1303447168565551105 2020-09-09 05:36:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV Switch that one D vote in Nebraska and all hell is going to break loose.

1303397105013329920 2020-09-09 02:17:40 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart I just don't think they can control it at this point. I think both sides expect something to happen and that alone is often enough of a spark to cause something to happen.
1303396040641572865 2020-09-09 02:13:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CottoGottfried @NoctRomaRTW I honestly think this could turn into a rout. I hope it does for all our sake's.
1303394864428732417 2020-09-09 02:08:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart Nation doesn't trust the mass media. Trump will be President until at least January 20th. As long as Trump stays outside of their custody, he will be able to send his message to the military and he has loyal soldiers and governors.
1303393688266121217 2020-09-09 02:04:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FlycatcherSilky Securing Georgia and North Carolina are the biggest things. Honestly, I don't think it was worth how much effort they've put in, but I'm kind of shocked it's working.
1303392830560272385 2020-09-09 02:00:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart I think they overestimate their chances, particularly with the military. Barr is laying the groundwork for resisting the legal tricks they will attempt as well.
1303392108313706497 2020-09-09 01:57:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I regret to inform hardcore wignats, but it's really looking like Trump has gained a significant amount of Black support in just about every poll. I haven't seen one with him below double digit support in a long time.
1303391243800584193 2020-09-09 01:54:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart It depends on if Trump wins. If Trump wins and he has the guts to resist, he has enough support.
1303390652743536642 2020-09-09 01:52:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV If those end up near the national shifts, Trump wins a landslide.
1303390391689936898 2020-09-09 01:50:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart I agree, long term. However, I still find it unlikely they win even short term. Their power centers are incredibly vulnerable: Even California.
1303387933882355712 2020-09-09 01:41:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot Lookup 2004 Washington Gubernatorial for how they might fix this problem in a diabolical way.
1303380130769895425 2020-09-09 01:10:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There’s a worst case scenario (perhaps several) where the Left wins a post-election civil war. I do not think this likely, but it is possible. War is always uncertain. Very unfortunate affairs.
1303379418023440392 2020-09-09 01:07:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III @Wasperation It really is just more convenient stripping for a lot of them. Lol.

1303356712238407680 2020-09-08 23:37:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Simplicissimu16 @BronzeCullis If Trump wins in November, I wouldn't bet on it. The Democrats are crazy enough to try it.
1303355741324095491 2020-09-08 23:33:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Simplicissimu16 @BronzeCullis The mag cap restriction is still in place pending final appeal. And that was the 9th Circuit, not the California Supreme Court.
1303355577041649664 2020-09-08 23:32:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Simplicissimu16 @BronzeCullis Like I said, in 95% of scenarios, they fail. However, in the off chance they get the right jump, that threat can be more easily neutralized than much of the country.
1303355343083376641 2020-09-08 23:31:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Simplicissimu16 @BronzeCullis I'm from California and everyone in my family that still lives there votes GOP and likes Trump. I'm not saying you don't matter. I'm just talking about possible scenarios where California or the West Coast generally attempts secession.
1303353915099021315 2020-09-08 23:26:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Simplicissimu16 @BronzeCullis It is, but it isn't outside the realm of possibility. In 95% or more scenarios, I think California is overwhelmed if they attempt secession. Mainly because Placer County is controlled by Republicans and Federal troops can poor in from there and seize all the food production.
1303353536336539652 2020-09-08 23:24:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Simplicissimu16 @BronzeCullis California has more Republicans than Texas because it is the most populous state. There are far more Democrats in the state and they control nearly all population and transport hubs outside of Fresno and Bakersfield.  And I'm merely explaining the best case scenario for the left.
1303352876966858755 2020-09-08 23:21:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Simplicissimu16 @BronzeCullis Basically, if the Marines at Camp Pendleton defect to the rebels in large numbers, and Colorado and New Mexico join in large enough numbers, it becomes very difficult to deploy overwhelming force quickly.
1303352386749112324 2020-09-08 23:19:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Simplicissimu16 @BronzeCullis California is more blue on a map than you would like to imagine and they notoriously have strict gun laws. I'm not saying this is likely (it very much isn't), but there are scenarios where CA, OR, &amp; WA are able to raise enough troops to secure everything West of the Rockies.  https://t.co/FZAoEoXpb3
1303350427849756673 2020-09-08 23:12:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis The longer you have an independent Western US fortifying the Rockies, the more true this is.
1303349962252660736 2020-09-08 23:10:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis The biggest natural boundary in the US is distance. FWIW (little), I've been playing some scenarios in my head for West Coast Secession: I think there are some scenarios where it's just difficult to get large numbers of troops out past the Rockies.
1303345821417603077 2020-09-08 22:53:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Yeah, it's difficult to imagine a permanent one right now. Someone just ends up being a big dog and eating everyone else over time. Only way I can see preventing this is if everyone was in interlocking alliances that prevented anyone from achieving overwhelming odds.
1303345396509560832 2020-09-08 22:52:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Anunnakimoment @BronzeCullis Even most balkanization scenarios would involve enough eventual reunification to emerge as a global power. A foreign power invited to our shores in a place like California or New England could be enough to deter adventurism, though.
1303344783595892738 2020-09-08 22:49:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis As long as the US stays relatively united, I agree. If we were to balkanize, this of course changes.
1303344361925640196 2020-09-08 22:48:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Yeah, honestly you don't seem like the typical autistic person I'm talking about. I'm talking about people who are very obsessive about one thing to the point of insanity. The type of people who tend to an extremism without practical balance.
1303341132877791232 2020-09-08 22:35:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BronzeCullis Sorry, it's for the greater good. lol

1303204644454268930 2020-09-08 13:32:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Basically, in a lot of states, the GOP are working at an immediate handicap because of the dishonesty of urban officialdom. They have to come up with dictator numbers in rural and exurban precincts to have a shot because those places are typically honest.
1303204140450033666 2020-09-08 13:30:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> That’s part of what makes this so effective. They go in to help great-grandma fill out her ballot at the nursing home and they inform that she really prefers Biden to Trump. If they even bother to tell her. They really feel this is her true preference...
1303203749930979329 2020-09-08 13:29:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> These people are the ones that come up with votes in the trunks of cars. They collect votes from people who are dead or who have moved. They get people to collect senior citizens’ absentee ballots and fill them out for Democrats. They actually consider this a community service...
1303203229577220096 2020-09-08 13:27:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Thinking about this: The question of cheating is a complicated one in the United States. There’s only so much of it you can do because votes are counted locally. The main source of cheating is Democratic elections officials in the inner cities....

1303199270632411139 2020-09-08 13:11:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AStratelates I once had someone try to convince me to get a job at the USPS because one day it could be activated as a right wing militia. I’m like:  https://t.co/ZjSxCIm5MH
1303194255817674753 2020-09-08 12:51:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I once showed up at a post office that was closed because no one had shown up for work that day.

So, the defeated Japanese warrior must commit sepuku because he brought shame to his family, not because he feels it internally.
1303181985192579073 2020-09-08 12:02:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba Is the UAE guilt based because it has more Whites than natives (true story)? Really confused here.

In Dec. 2016 there were about 22K troops in Iraq+Afghanistan, mostly Afghanistan. Military Times thinks there's about 8500 in Afghanistan now ( https://t.co/52uUA3rRAv). Iraqi numbers aren't clear, but US forces have handed over many bases.
1303175714569678850 2020-09-08 11:37:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Rickymccarl1 It's the entire point of critical race theory: If you don't agree, you're not listening, and if you just listen to them talk, you're letting them convince everyone of their horrid opinions. They basically have pathologized dissent.

He also wants to get us out of Afghanistan and Iraq and has done a lot to draw down our forces. Drones are de-escalations compared to boots on the ground.

1303172298535587849 2020-09-08 11:24:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Maybe because "racism" isn't a sin once mentioned anywhere in the Bible and Critical Race Theory is clearly antagonistic to the Christian doctrine of Original Sin, among others.
1303171194640830464 2020-09-08 11:19:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @chrislhayes I'd take you more seriously if you would just acknowledge something good Trump does once in a blue moon. No, you can't. You're like psychologically incapable or worse.
1303170885566816257 2020-09-08 11:18:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @chrislhayes LMAO, dude. Trump is the first President in decades to not start another war and you don't think this is "good faith." Anti-war Democrats are jokes.
1303170653529538561 2020-09-08 11:17:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV Chris Hayes someone isn't engaging in "good faith discourse": Seriously, fuck off.

1303165781593780229 2020-09-08 10:58:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brianalmon Reagan still switches parties and gets elected in 1966, opportunistically challenging an unpopular Pat Brown.

1303128735395307521 2020-09-08 08:31:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly That was my thinking. That and everything was just so new and fresh in this essentially virgin land.
1303127278667411456 2020-09-08 08:25:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @KingFrenly I concede the spirit of the hexagon, but there definitely was something about America that spurred that population’s creative faculties to their peak.
1303126933291573248 2020-09-08 08:24:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LDF120 @Wasperation This is an incredibly one dimensional way of looking at quality of life. Also, “peaks” occur after the rot has already begun. That’s the reason things decline from the peak. America in the 1990s was the best place to live ever for most people there.
1303126085375348737 2020-09-08 08:20:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I doubt this considering the surge of innovation that occurred in late 19th, early 20th Century America.
1303124980813778945 2020-09-08 08:16:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @quintfilius It’s just unjust too. Like, why is it ok to come in and steal stuff from people because you think they have too much? This guy calling himself trad while giving an apologia for King Ahab wanting a better vineyard.

1302998468374429696 2020-09-07 23:53:38 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @TheLaurenChen Precisely. It's just a straight up rejection of longstanding English tradition. I understand this is far from a universal practice, even among traditional societies, but it is the way we symbolize something more important.

They don't view antifa as threats, but tools. Muslims pose no great threat either. RW "terrorists," despite their small numbers, actually threaten their power.
1302796291500630018 2020-09-07 10:30:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> The left has been trying the "GOP President is Hitler" line for decades now. It was a nice little way to score cheap rhetorical points and pump up the base. Problem is they clearly believe it this time. They're that delusional.

1302039062233088000 2020-09-05 08:21:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @anteruina Yes.
1302031704446689280 2020-09-05 07:52:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton I mean, that definitely sounds Atomwaffen tier lmao.
1302028433657126914 2020-09-05 07:39:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CantusLaudanum @Gravelord_Kyle It’s probably overestimating how often they were hitting allied shipping. Most of those raids were over in minutes.
1302009881214492690 2020-09-05 06:25:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton @RupertVonRipp That gun is remarkably fed looking. You’d think one of these guys would at least try to show up with something that doesn’t look like it comes straight out of an FBI armory.
1302009478158659584 2020-09-05 06:23:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton @RupertVonRipp Definitely.
1301996725100568576 2020-09-05 05:33:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Wow.

1301979904389591042 2020-09-05 04:26:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @oblivionrecurs This happened in PA in 2016. I remember initial results had Clinton up near 60 and Trump below 40. Looked really bad until you realized it was a bunch of mail in ballots from Philadelphia that was the bulk of the vote.
1301974265177223170 2020-09-05 04:03:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @elh2005 @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY He also didn't call us to use the standards of modern liberal news companies.
1301966589881876481 2020-09-05 03:33:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @oblivionrecurs I think that was opposed to other forms of early voting. Also, mail in ballots back west are a different breed. I know absentee votes used to favor the GOP in California back in the day.
1301965741147803654 2020-09-05 03:29:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @oblivionrecurs Makes sense to me. GOP loves to vote in person and most on the GOP side aren't irrationally afraid of covid.
1301965245343203329 2020-09-05 03:27:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @oblivionrecurs That would make up a huge mail in gap.
1301962584271335429 2020-09-05 03:17:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @elh2005 @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY When I say "you have no moral responsibility to verify it," I'm saying your belief in it need not stand up in a court.
1301962233669455872 2020-09-05 03:16:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @elh2005 @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY We clearly don't agree on point two: I think it is ok to share information which you are unsure is true. You have no moral responsibility to verify it. This is because the only things we can know with religious certainty are in Scripture.
1301961682433060871 2020-09-05 03:13:49 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lady_Astor Fairly certain this guy would turn around immediately:  https://t.co/YFusuUXBdc

We both agree it's wrong to spread veritably false info. 2. Is it ok to spread information you believe, but don't know for sure, to be true?
1301958453443923970 2020-09-05 03:00:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @elh2005 @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY So, merely spreading it as something you believe to be true is fine?
1301957727430881280 2020-09-05 02:58:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @elh2005 @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY I've worked in intelligence and law enforcement. Sometimes anonymity is necessary for that type of work and that's the type of work QAnon claims to be engaged in. I don't believe the whole idea, once again, but anonymity is not sufficient grounds to disbelieve someone.
1301956085625036802 2020-09-05 02:51:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @elh2005 @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY Sometimes you have to make snap judgments based on limited information. It's the nature of life.
1301955893655896076 2020-09-05 02:50:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @elh2005 @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY All of the claims, or merely some? Also, the nature of QAnon is one guy (supposedly, I don't trust it personally) is supposedly reporting on events. It's a matter of trust: Do you trust the source or not? Some people apparently do and the most you can accuse them is gullibility.
1301955146755256323 2020-09-05 02:47:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @elh2005 @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY That's a very particular assertion. Yes, if a particular statement is verifiably false through common knowledge. However, that doesn't reach to things that are not verifiably false. Also, these applies equally to all news sources, not just QAnon and Alex Jones.
1301953905027407873 2020-09-05 02:42:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @elh2005 @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY That's my point: You're only talking about QAnon. Because you're so offended by this one conspiracy theory, you're blind to the precedent you are setting of incompetent pastors adjudicating every random conspiracy theory someone might have. It's ok to believe weird things.
1301953294466789376 2020-09-05 02:40:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @elh2005 @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY What if someone believes the information is true? Why is it the pastor's responsibility to adjudicate that?   The New York Times has also published false information: Should we stop reading it?   Your principle is very one sided against people who believe unpopular things.
1301952736871829505 2020-09-05 02:38:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @elh2005 @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY Once again: Does that mean I can't believe any conspiracy theories? Does that mean I should only believe what's printed in the Newspaper of Record? Is that what you believe? You haven't articulated any principles.
1301952478531981314 2020-09-05 02:37:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy Seriously, these people are unprincipled fruitcakes who want to use the power of the Church to suppress things they don't like. I'm almost starting to believe it myself. Look at this guy:  https://t.co/7RlhQr8nwh
1301951699477762052 2020-09-05 02:34:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @elh2005 @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY Where does this stop? You only want to apply it to QAnon.
1301951215077658635 2020-09-05 02:32:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @elh2005 @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY That's what your position commits you to. You're the one making an unprincipled exception for QAnon because you're particularly offended by this false belief for some reason.
1301950499026071552 2020-09-05 02:29:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @elh2005 @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY The deceiver here, if anyone, is the person posting to the QAnon website. It is not someone who believes his false testimony. Anyone is liable to be conned from time to time and you're foolish if you think you're not susceptible yourself.
1301949861080829952 2020-09-05 02:26:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @elh2005 @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY You're the one making an unprincipled exception due to your ideological objections to QAnon, not me.
1301949761147334657 2020-09-05 02:26:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @elh2005 @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY Do you honestly the Church can figure what is true in any given circumstance and police member beliefs and advocacy at that level? Should we excommunicate defense attorney when their clients are convicted too? Prosecutors when they lose a case?
1301948743110012928 2020-09-05 02:22:24 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @elh2005 @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY It's the same principle: Believing incorrect things is not, in and of itself, a matter of Church discipline.
1301946304189394946 2020-09-05 02:12:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy @ReformedMallard "If you believe the Bible, you probably worship it more than Jesus!"

1301945874373894145 2020-09-05 02:11:00 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @elh2005 @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY So, believing the wrong thing about the JFK assassination is now a matter of Church discipline? That's what he's advocating here.
1301945591832997888 2020-09-05 02:09:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CyberSubutai @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY I don't even buy into QAnon, but it's utterly bizarre that this guy calls it "unchristian" just because there are good guys and bad guys in the conspiracy theory. It certainly isn't a matter of Church discipline in and of itself.
1301943383733264385 2020-09-05 02:01:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @MarkDice The left still believes Jewell was guilty. Pretty sure I saw some defenses of the mob in that case around that documentary that was released last year.
1301942893859479553 2020-09-05 01:59:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I also love all these people who act like he's some brave stalwart for standing up to QAnon followers. Yeah, sure, real brave to take the position every other major cultural figure takes.
1301941498964045824 2020-09-05 01:53:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @edstetzer @kevinhash @USATODAY Ed, how do you adjudicate what is and isn't true? Lots of stuff goes on in the world you don't know about. Why do you suppose you are more competent to judge the facts than your parishioners?
1301940466720571392 2020-09-05 01:49:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @shuggabumfairy The reaction to it almost makes me want to believe it.
1301939428601008130 2020-09-05 01:45:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Ignore the QAnon issue for a moment: Quite frankly, I don't care about it. The point is that pastors are not competent adjudicators of facts outside of religious contexts. They cannot tell you what to believe about who did 9/11 or any other conspiracy theory.
1301938622153842693 2020-09-05 01:42:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReformedMallard I don't know what happened to Protestants, but I remember a time when you used to have to prove something was immoral using the Bible. The principles here would just paralyze you into inaction through fear of some weird form of idolatry.
1301938270079770626 2020-09-05 01:40:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ReformedMallard This is so dumb. I don't buy QAnon, but it isn't incompatible with the Christian religion.
1301933818081873922 2020-09-05 01:23:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChancelThreader @JorgvonWartburg @SynodTn Very true. The abolitionist position is clearly nowhere justified in Scripture.
1301932792633331713 2020-09-05 01:19:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JorgvonWartburg @SynodTn @ChancelThreader You're confusing my position: I'm not saying the slave is not property. I'm just saying it's a different class of property than chattel.
1301929856264003584 2020-09-05 01:07:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JorgvonWartburg @SynodTn @ChancelThreader Kidnapping is obviously the unlawful taking of a person. I'm unconvinced this has general application to slavery if the taking was lawful. However, the Scriptures do seem to show different regulations are applied to slaves than typical chattel like your house furniture.
1301926241667289090 2020-09-05 00:52:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SynodTn @ChancelThreader I'm of the opinion slavery is perfectly lawful, but I'm not sure about the specific case of chattel slavery. There seems to me general moral principles that would require certain behavior towards slaves that precludes treating them like other chattel.
1301924223150174208 2020-09-05 00:44:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChancelThreader Unsure, but based for sure.
1301920417058295808 2020-09-05 00:29:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart We send our people off to die so they can spit in our face and laugh at us behind our back. Trump finally says no and our establishment gets angry.
1301920262988890119 2020-09-05 00:29:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart It’s so dumb. We have the power in these relationships. We should exercise it. The thinking on the other side is that we need to be some super gentle leader in order to maintain power: That kind of power isn’t worth having anyway.
1301919241214590979 2020-09-05 00:25:10 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart Anything over which Trump has had unilateral and direct authority has been a resounding success, really.
1301919119202291712 2020-09-05 00:24:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NatPresPart He does that and he has a presence about him that indicates he’s serious despite his jokes. It’s also something over which he has nearly unquestionable unilateral authority.
1301917112156463104 2020-09-05 00:16:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> It's just amazing to me: If this was any other President in our history, he'd have been hailed as one of the greatest diplomats of all times. This and the UAE-Israel deal are legitimate contenders for the Nobel Peace Prize if it weren't for who did it.

1301901534213672960 2020-09-04 23:14:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lady_Astor People have this idea, especially among "Christians" that you're supposed to get along with everyone. It just ends up with a bunch of suppressed personalities subscribing to a bland niceness.
1301900002457944066 2020-09-04 23:08:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lady_Astor You know what? It's also entirely normal for people to rub others the wrong way. Some people just will never get along and that's fine.

1301897119293476864 2020-09-04 22:57:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV For clarification: Absentee ballots have started being mailed out today. You could receive them today I suppose, but not likely. None could possibly have been returned.
1301896575380271107 2020-09-04 22:55:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV That's ballot requests, not the ballots themselves.

1301877110290644992 2020-09-04 21:37:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> 7% is a really high number. It just is. Especially considering that protests that turn violent are liable to last longer. How many of these "protests" were a bunch of random suburban White people standing on a street corner with a dumb sign.

1301729753326596096 2020-09-04 11:52:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @JBFalke I think having one assigned directly to New England would be too offensive to their sensibilities. They’d all be assigned to the colonies as a whole.
1301729409263640576 2020-09-04 11:50:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StochasticReso1 @adamgoldmanNYT “Jesus Freak” Portland had a reputation for being a decade behind everyone else when I lived there. Glad to see that’s still the case.
1301728164478156800 2020-09-04 11:45:54 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 @JBFalke Seems like if you send one, you need three to reproduce themselves without having to go back to England to obtain new bishops. A bishop and two suffragans seems appropriate.
1301727869757001728 2020-09-04 11:44:43 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StochasticReso1 @adamgoldmanNYT Yes, I’m sure the Portland riots have been fueled for over 100 days by Washingtonians.

1301725652467544064 2020-09-04 11:35:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JBFalke @AnglicanMan19 Sending some to the Southern colonies and getting a working seminary at William &amp; Mary would have bolstered those colonies natural bent towards loyalty. The problem is that was considered a problem to the Hanovers.
1301718066745823238 2020-09-04 11:05:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis @RedEaglePatriot He also really isn't that old in terms of modern life expediencies. He's 77, not 87.
1301717851745800200 2020-09-04 11:04:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @realRonDeSantis @RedEaglePatriot I see a lot of people acting like he's a normal old person. I don't know, my grandmother is older than he is and has a lot of lung problems, but she knows how to put together a sentence. Same with other old people I know. Old people forgetfulness isn't what he's displaying.
1301715488523907072 2020-09-04 10:55:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation All the people whining about the Patriot Act because they were convinced Bush was Hitler, supported it under Obama and that's when Snowden is their enemy.

1301706245351538688 2020-09-04 10:18:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot I'm concerned at this point because so many large states important for our economy are still on lockdown.

1301698845638877184 2020-09-04 09:49:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 It's quite obvious to all but the most anti-European, bigoted onlooker that the soul of a whole people was crushed by that war. World War II was a bunch of toddlers fighting over the husk left behind.
1301698534253658112 2020-09-04 09:48:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp Everyone knew Wilson's "Make the world safe for democracy" idea was total trash. That's why the GOP rejected Versailles. We were very reluctant to go to war, went to war as a matter of national pride, and quickly regretted the whole adventure.

1301697161659387910 2020-09-04 09:42:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @LuisBobby3 I was outspoken about this in school and even the liberal teachers didn't even bother telling me I was wrong on this one.
1301696346295021568 2020-09-04 09:39:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ChelenaDrew That's what I'm saying: Most people wouldn't have cared generally, but if someone told them "I don't think we should have gotten involved in that war," they'd either agree or not care enough to argue the point.
1301696009282744320 2020-09-04 09:38:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm not even talking about the type of people posting on Twitter these days. I'm just talking about your uncle who thinks all the politicians are liars and likes to whittle.
1301695424152195072 2020-09-04 09:35:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> A fairly decent chunk of Americans don't believe the US was right to intervene in World War I. If someone said this in 2000, they'd at worst be considered quirky for bringing up the point while a lot of people subtly agreed.
1301689144758894594 2020-09-04 09:10:50 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Most people when they vote are incredibly selfish. That’s why ridiculous Democratic smears on Republicans that they’re out to get your social security check are very effective. The GOP hasn’t been after your SS check since 1944 and this still somehow works.
1301688488849543169 2020-09-04 09:08:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou The GOP can’t make enough hay on it because for most voters it is a minor issue and the propaganda on the left is very thick on it.
1301681653832708096 2020-09-04 08:41:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> This is still a good thing. If the GOP can be successfully divorced from the traditional powerbrokers, it becomes a much fairer playing field.
1301681392686960640 2020-09-04 08:40:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @CityBureaucrat It is a good thing, though. If they rely solely on the people to carry them to political office, maybe we have a chance.

1301613722587275264 2020-09-04 04:11:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy The margins in raw vote totals is what matter for this. They need a margin where they can finagle the results in deeply corrupt urban areas where they have total control. I think that was beyond their control in PA and WI in 2016 and it took them by surprise.
1301599681718484992 2020-09-04 03:15:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @HeritageNLegacy True. If the election is close, though, I’ve seen Democrats surreptitiously find ballots in trunks of cars and stuff like that. 2004 Washington Gubernatorial had one such case and so did 2008 Minnesota Senate. If Trump is ahead by 10K in PA, expect crap like that.
1301598891452895234 2020-09-04 03:12:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> There have been multiple elector slates sent from the same state before. I’d have to lookup the most recent time this happened, but Gore did famously dismiss a challenge to Florida’s votes from the floor in 2000.
1301598210075619330 2020-09-04 03:09:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Fun fact: Electors send their results to the President of the Senate, Mike Pence. Ultimately he decides who to recognize.
1301597198073966593 2020-09-04 03:05:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @StaresInStoic I think that’s it.

1301594944755433475 2020-09-04 02:56:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TennentsPlease House Republicans ran behind Trump in the midterms, crazy enough. I think Trump had something like 47% approval versus 44% GOP House vote.
1301594168989544448 2020-09-04 02:53:26 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TennentsPlease Really depends on how Trump does. If Trump wins by the same margin he did last time, probably 10. If Trump outperforms himself by a hair, I think 15-20 is reasonable. Problem is California, really. That’s why no one is talking about the House.

1301577342268198914 2020-09-04 01:46:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Essentially what happened in 2018 is that a standard midterm backlash turned into a slightly worse than average R rout in the House because of incredibly uniform Democratic vote.
1301575821266743296 2020-09-04 01:40:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Their top line was bad, but their internals were accurate. They just really underestimated the Democratic turnout. Notably the accurate polls really underestimated total turnout. Both sides had record turnout numbers, it was just INSANELY high on the D side.

1301543590687113216 2020-09-03 23:32:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheEorlkonig @NoctRomaRTW @SelimSeesYou Worst case scenario drags on for a long time. Perhaps beyond morale breaking point for the right wing side. However, if the Marines at Camp Pendleton hang on there, it's probably over in a matter of months.
1301542680032407552 2020-09-03 23:28:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> On a uniform national swing, the GOP retakes the House if they lose the House Popular vote by 3-4. Uniform national swings rarely happen, but the overall numbers tend to be pretty close.
1301530336770260992 2020-09-03 22:39:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @TheEorlkonig @NoctRomaRTW @SelimSeesYou California simply can't defend itself. It would have to take Nevada, Oregon, and Washington with it to even last long and even then it's extremely vulnerable. Then their only prayer is unrest in the rest of the US causing delays, allowing them to build defenses.
1301529278207733760 2020-09-03 22:35:35 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @SelimSeesYou California has zero strategic depth and the only point of defense is controlled by Republicans.
1301527840266096640 2020-09-03 22:29:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @SelimSeesYou Trump is not going to let California secede. It's just not going to happen.
1301526842999017474 2020-09-03 22:25:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @SelimSeesYou The problem for Dems is so much of their pop vote increase comes from their own states.   If Trump loses the PV, though, the only way we're getting anything done is if there's basically a civil war over it and I'm just not sure that will happen.
1301525972467023872 2020-09-03 22:22:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoctRomaRTW @SelimSeesYou Yeah, this really boils down to raw vote totals. I don't see Trump getting less than 63 million votes like he got last time. For Biden to win by 5 percent, he needs 70 million votes. He needs to beat Obama.
1301524514082357249 2020-09-03 22:16:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ThisIsMy4thAcc2 How do people still care about this? It's like they don't even care about the numbers at all.
1301523922618286080 2020-09-03 22:14:18 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @luksic_leonardo @PollWatch2020 It has only been in the past two decades that GOP party affiliation has even come close to Democrat as the parties align closer to their ideological bases and conservative Democrats are exiled from the party.
1301523700207038464 2020-09-03 22:13:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @luksic_leonardo @PollWatch2020 I'm talking historic, not the past few cycles. It was around 10-15 between the 90s and 00s. Then 20s before that. Traditionally GOP party affiliation is very poor. Consider that Reagan was dealing with an electorate that was 43% Democrat to 28% Republican.
1301522974546239488 2020-09-03 22:10:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou Electoral college actually favored Dems in 2008 and 2012: Meaning, in a uniform national swing, Democrats would win the electoral college while losing the popular vote.   Uniform national swings never happen, but they are a good gauge for similar races.
1301522270582648835 2020-09-03 22:07:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @luksic_leonardo @PollWatch2020 20% of Democrats voting GOP is an historic norm.
1301519650577158150 2020-09-03 21:57:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ScottMGreer @groyper_boston Let me guess: All three have gotten a divorce since 2016.
1301517839678005248 2020-09-03 21:50:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @brad_polumbo @RyanGirdusky Yeah, what libertarians really need to do is use more state power to police people's thoughts about race and sex. Only way forward really. Very libertarian.
1301508941453709312 2020-09-03 21:14:47 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @tonybalogna @SelimSeesYou The best part was that a couple of the ratings had it as Lean D. Lmao.
1301367382326349825 2020-09-03 11:52:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 These people have gone nuts. They just like refuse to believe the right ever has a point. The right’s fundamental problem is the left has been acting this way for about 8-12 years and the right hasn’t caught up to it yet.
1301361785635835911 2020-09-03 11:30:02 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Yes, disenfranchising your political opposition is, in fact, an effective method of retaining power.
1301360647742119936 2020-09-03 11:25:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IiiInnocentius @ArenMys I almost feel like that would be better.
1301360565215023104 2020-09-03 11:25:11 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IiiInnocentius @ArenMys I used to work across the street from their lobbying HQ in DC (it’s in an historic manor). Gave me the creeps.
1301360000481271808 2020-09-03 11:22:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @IiiInnocentius @ArenMys I was going to go with Mormonism, but Scientology is really bad. It’s such an obvious con game.
1301358861446774784 2020-09-03 11:18:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @samhydegger Don’t do it. There’s plenty of time for that in BigLaw.
1301357403565436928 2020-09-03 11:12:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Theo_Chilton “Oh, you and what army?”  *Hears M1 Abrams turn on in the background*  “I’m willing to negotiate.”
1301354594061242371 2020-09-03 11:01:27 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot That’s in a state where I imagine enforcement is somewhat ordinary procedure. In California, they don’t call the DMV the “Department of Mexican Voters” for nothing.
1301348071998197760 2020-09-03 10:35:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I really can’t believe how the people who whine about “oppression” can’t see the obvious power dynamics of the Speaker of the House strong arming freaking hair stylists.
1301346810305314817 2020-09-03 10:30:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @4dchessmaster1 I'd be more amused if they weren't running the country in spite of our best efforts.
1301345941782441991 2020-09-03 10:27:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot It's almost like we have a federal system where states vote and not individual voters.
1301345306991308801 2020-09-03 10:24:33 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @DanielChapter5 @NationalistTV Gun stores seem to have a pretty low compliance rate for sure.
1301344783785492481 2020-09-03 10:22:28 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV @chhardman This is why I hate East Coast life.
1301331231548768257 2020-09-03 09:28:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JoelLoren1 Given what is going on in the world, the accuracy of the passage is striking.
1301329033674797056 2020-09-03 09:19:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I’m not saying Alex Jones or whoever is a reliable alternative news source. Just that the traditionally reliable forms of media aren’t. You’re better off trusting your own instincts.
1301328799607525376 2020-09-03 09:18:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Literally put nothing past anyone in the approved media at this point. Their power has gone to their heads. They believe their own lies. They suppress all contrary evidence. It’s Romans 1 in a nutshell and it’s why cons who don’t understand this look more and more pathetic.
1301326579121913861 2020-09-03 09:10:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @evelyn_waugh1 It’s the entire Trump phenomenon and that’s why they hate it. I really feel like another rejection might break their spirit even if all they really need to do is wait four more years. They’re known for poor timing.
1301326005383168001 2020-09-03 09:07:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @evelyn_waugh1 It’s just remarkable how difficult their victories are in spite of all their seeming advantages. People’s instincts just revolt against their agenda a lot.
1301320818174156801 2020-09-03 08:47:15 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou There was a poll yesterday out that Trump down 2 nationally. Polls are all over the place.
1301316443670278144 2020-09-03 08:29:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Wasperation His first terms was based: Ford famously visited him because he didn’t want the “FOBs” to come to California.
1301297847426527232 2020-09-03 07:15:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou Very true. Notably, male voting habits don’t change near as much. Married men are more likely to vote GOP, but both single and married White men vote GOP.
1301297255165591552 2020-09-03 07:13:37 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Timcast Finally.
1301297067529310208 2020-09-03 07:12:52 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou In 2016, consistent with 20102, the gap was huge between married and single women. Married women voted for the GOP MORE than married men (not much more, but some), while single women were overwhelmingly opposed.
1301293363841376256 2020-09-03 06:58:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Sorry, I just don't know what to believe anymore. It's frustrating to watch people so desperate to save their own sad, pathetic existences they suggest stuff like this.
1301293099193438208 2020-09-03 06:57:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I'm serious: What is wrong with most people? How is this even a suggestion? The only people I know like this in real are real life bureaucrat gang, yet supposedly this crap has high support.
1301292583898025985 2020-09-03 06:55:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @PiousTusks @Theo_Chilton I think it's a good way to read it if you have the right mindset. As a devotional and way to get an overarching "story" of the Bible, it's fine. It's absolutely a terrible way to study it as a piece of literature considering it isn't really one piece of literature.
1301291910410260489 2020-09-03 06:52:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @evelyn_waugh1 I just don't know with some of these polls. You saw how fast they turned around on BLM since June. People "agree" with things for a lot of different reasons and those reasons matter for how they think about things.
1301291316261933057 2020-09-03 06:50:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou I don't think this works among mothers with boys as much.
1301291121008619521 2020-09-03 06:49:14 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou Exactly. It's a crass attempt to look cool to younger people. Even Republican-leaning college educated people imagine themselves to be tolerant and "liberal" in a classical sense. It's this meme:  https://t.co/rioK70NK8i
1301290653360558082 2020-09-03 06:47:23 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @evelyn_waugh1 I'm concerned, but don't get into panic mode by any stretch.
1301290457415258118 2020-09-03 06:46:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou It was very good. That and the sex stuff.
1301290245133078529 2020-09-03 06:45:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou The socialization seems to have trickled up from the younger people. Basically, these people all end up working and talking to each other and they don't talk to their non-educated peers. So, the older folks are just as much part of this imbibing as the younger ones.
1301289944942546944 2020-09-03 06:44:34 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou It's socialization more than anything. That's why it even shows up among Evangelicals who wouldn't buy into the sexual revolution at least.
1301289672023384065 2020-09-03 06:43:29 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @SelimSeesYou One thing is for sure: These places have become absolute indoctrination centers.
1301288889366253571 2020-09-03 06:40:22 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> FNC has had a lot of Trump's absolute worst polls. They had him at -12 on election day 2016.
1301288593277804544 2020-09-03 06:39:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou I just don't see how Trump will end up that crushed with college Whites when he squeaked out a 48-45 win among them in 2016. We will see I guess. Hispanics and college Whites definitely appear to be the most malleable voting groups.
1301285092665495552 2020-09-03 06:25:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ArenMys @KingFrenly They've been doing this since before any of us were born. "San Francisco is great because of all the great diverse food choices from immigrants!"
1301284720790175744 2020-09-03 06:23:48 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III It really is contrarianism. If Trump came out tomorrow and pushed through an immigration moratorium, instead of taking the W, they'd spend their time complaining he wasn't actively seeking Afrikaner immigrants.
1301284300965457923 2020-09-03 06:22:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @whiterage7 @RupertVonRipp @Indian_Bronson I rarely eat breakfast. Every once in a while I'll treat myself to some bacon and eggs or something.

I just wonder what world these people live in as they post this crap over a broadband internet connection.
1301283422007169036 2020-09-03 06:18:39 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III 55% of people own stocks. This is America, not some shithole third world country where no one has any savings. Sometimes I forget how much money I have (not that I have a ton, but with a shit ton hiding in 401(k)s, it's easy for your assets to escape your notice).
1301282987309490176 2020-09-03 06:16:55 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RupertVonRipp @Indian_Bronson Yeah: Coffee, (breakfast if I eat it), and then shower, etc. I don't know how else to do the morning.
1301277660753154048 2020-09-03 05:55:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NoOne60a @NoTrueScotist Their moron followers always attempt to engage and get clobbered.
1301266275939880965 2020-09-03 05:10:31 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III This is one reason I can't stand the incessant pandering. He's able to get a decent number of Black votes just naturally based on his personality and there are still plenty of Uncle Ruckus types floating around
1301261308994695175 2020-09-03 04:50:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> Pelosi is a real piece of work. Imagine the audacity of being Speaker of the House trying to shut down a hair salon.
1301260281914503172 2020-09-03 04:46:42 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @sullen_eyed @FreeNortherner People who believe are essentially saying that, in order to keep borders open, we should all be confined to our homes. It's absolutely insane.
1301258899710976002 2020-09-03 04:41:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @FreeNortherner I’m just amazed people actually believe border enforcement won’t work but being confined to your home does. It’s literally the same principle in both cases, just rigorously enforced in the latter.

1301246187081793537 2020-09-03 03:50:41 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot The trend in a poll is at least as interesting as the numbers themselves. Right now, all these polls are based on electorate composition speculations we can only make an educated guess on until election day.
1301243372707946499 2020-09-03 03:39:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III It really is. Corporations as corporations usually just take the easiest path to profit. They're not into surreptitiously funding mass movements decades ahead of time to maybe gain a few extra percentages points of profit in the long run. That's not even foreseeable.
1301227289938726912 2020-09-03 02:35:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ArenMys This is true, but certain aspects of Shia Islam are just weird to understand for an outsider even beyond political dynamics.

It's so devious and evil that if they get away with it, I can only imagine God is punishing us.
1301210018801315840 2020-09-03 01:26:58 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Lady_Astor This is why Americans won't give up their guns. They want to do that crap here.
1301209110566899715 2020-09-03 01:23:21 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 It looks like a good deal on the rifle in any case. Worst case scenario looks like you can sell it on Gunbroker for a small profit.

1301205485190811648 2020-09-03 01:08:57 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @RedEaglePatriot YouGov is the most overrated pollster of all time from precisely one election.
1301205063130640384 2020-09-03 01:07:16 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @SuperSaltTea I've already seen consistent attacks on the Senate. The problem in both cases is the same: We were a federal structure, but so much of government has been nationalized the states don't really have as much freedom as they should.
1301204765142069252 2020-09-03 01:06:05 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SelimSeesYou @SuperSaltTea I mean, California has 40 million people and Wyoming has less like 580,000: I don't see how it can get much more imbalanced than that with California's growth rate slowing down to the point they might lose a House seat.
1301200399521771524 2020-09-03 00:48:45 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @ProudEorzean I know. That's how you know the whole thing is a con so their rampant fraud in places like Crook County, Illinois, King County, Washington, illegal votes in California can ruin the national elections.
1301199080022896640 2020-09-03 00:43:30 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @Groyple @NationalistTV They also don't understand that in other countries with NPVs for Presidential elections, they have two rounds with a runoff to get a majority typically. They don't just use FPTP. They also have national voter registration, which we don't have.
1301198808626475008 2020-09-03 00:42:25 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @NationalistTV I'll keep saying this again and again: They advocate for National Popular Vote, but they refuse to mention any of the myriad of system changes we would need to make to make it equitable.
1301194707670839296 2020-09-03 00:26:07 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @SirStevenKJ @RyanGirdusky Dems heavily outregister Rs in PA. If it's sampling registered Ds vs Rs, it's fine.
1301191958577250309 2020-09-03 00:15:12 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> I think it’s something like this that will set people off. We’ve been remarkably complacent because of material prosperity. What happens when the trappings of that prosperity disappear?

1301151778394832897 2020-09-02 21:35:32 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @JCompson_III The thing with this one is that it is so much effort to remember how all this degenerate trans shit works.

1300814823958237193 2020-09-01 23:16:36 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 It’s worse than that considering I’d bet half of those people are kooky dispies who read too much Daniel.
1300811472176648192 2020-09-01 23:03:17 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dukeoftheweald @Raffaus1 All lefties who believe in the supernatural do this in some way. Lefties Catholics tend to denounce the hierarchy. Leftie Muslims deny the authority of Imams.
1300811164243329026 2020-09-01 23:02:04 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dukeoftheweald @Raffaus1 It’s obvious among Evangelicals where progressive Evangelicals say they are “Jesus followers” and that “Jesus was against religion.”
1300810858738651136 2020-09-01 23:00:51 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dukeoftheweald @Raffaus1 It is. That’s why the first targets of leftist revolutionaries are traditional religious institutions.
1300810643315056640 2020-09-01 22:59:59 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dukeoftheweald @Raffaus1 Yes. Because even if you are a secular rightist you have to defend the practical social value of religion. A right-left axis can effectively be replaced by a “religious vs irreligious” axis. Note the “religious” left usually denies that they are “religious” in some sense too.
1300809861123448833 2020-09-01 22:56:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dukeoftheweald @Raffaus1 Yes, in an ultimate sense. They can obviously be to the right in terms of the practical political order and sit on that side of the legislature. They are not ultimately committed to it.
1300809578880421888 2020-09-01 22:55:46 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dukeoftheweald @Raffaus1 By not actually believing in the metaphysical order they are trying to enforce. This is why secular rightist arguments are overwhelmingly pragmatic ones. It’s not about there being a chain of being, it’s simply that right wing societies work and leftist ones don’t.
1300809217218088961 2020-09-01 22:54:19 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dukeoftheweald @Raffaus1 Yes, that’s kind of the point.
1300808916054487040 2020-09-01 22:53:08 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dukeoftheweald @Raffaus1 There is no metaphysical natural order in a world without metaphysics.
1300808393154867201 2020-09-01 22:51:03 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dukeoftheweald @Raffaus1 I’m not saying people who disagree with my religious beliefs can’t be rightists. Only that the genuine right with heart commitment to the doctrine of the right has to be, by definition, committed to some religion. I don’t demand they be High Church Anglicans to be genuine.
1300808062769475590 2020-09-01 22:49:44 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dukeoftheweald @Raffaus1 The religious right is metaphysically committed to the right in the way the irreligious simply cannot be. Once again: Our doctrines aren’t the same, though our praxis may be.
1300807846112694272 2020-09-01 22:48:53 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dukeoftheweald @Raffaus1 Yes, let’s just declare it absurd and move on without even defining what the right is. Our point is the doctrines aren’t similar: It’s the praxis that is similar, if anything. The doctrine of religious rightists is enforcing a transcendent order. 1/2
1300806674173878273 2020-09-01 22:44:13 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @BeigeShiba They certainly could just lower the advance or royalty.
1300805615065980928 2020-09-01 22:40:01 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dukeoftheweald @Raffaus1 2/2 Right wingers who are agnostic or irreligious tend to be Reactionary Modernists, like the Fascists. Most of them still have commitments to the supernatural. Old school reactionaries deny the right wing creds of reactionary modernists and the old school was there first.
1300805192229715969 2020-09-01 22:38:20 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dukeoftheweald @Raffaus1 And you have yet to offer a substantive definition of the right or proper any early rightist thinkers who weren’t deeply committed to some sort of religion. Mauras is the closest I can think of and he was still deeply committed to a Catholic France. 1/2
1300803387290783745 2020-09-01 22:31:09 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dukeoftheweald @Raffaus1 The earliest right wingers all had at least superficial attachments to religion. You can be a “secular” right winger in the sense you are committed to right wing beliefs beyond any individual religious creed, but the belief in transcendent order itself is a religious belief.
1300802577999769600 2020-09-01 22:27:56 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @AnglicanMan19 The bigger problem IMO is that Churchgoing core is ill-equipped. If the majority of that 37% was well-equipped for the spiritual warfare in which we are engaged, these nominal Christians might be better behaved.
1300800102580260865 2020-09-01 22:18:06 +0800 <rightwingnutrs> @dukeoftheweald @Raffaus1 I don’t really think so. Perennialists can be because they are vaguely religious. But agnostic types that believe in “right wing” polities for pragmatic reasons don’t have fundamentally different beliefs from the left. The right is committed to transcendent order.
