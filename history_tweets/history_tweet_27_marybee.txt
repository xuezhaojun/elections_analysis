1343960478536650752 2020-12-30 00:42:02 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie So sorry dearie. I hope she gets better soon x
1343700195582889988 2020-12-29 07:27:46 +0800 <marybee> Growing up, I also faced severe social stigma due to my glasses. People’s reaction varied between shock, pity, and ridicule. I was bullied at school and mocked at social gatherings. Until I was able to get contact lenses.
1343700194412666881 2020-12-29 07:27:45 +0800 <marybee> I have yet to find a frame that’s fashionable and can sustain the weight of my glasses. Being severely nearsighted is not fashionable and neither is cheap.
1343700192567193600 2020-12-29 07:27:45 +0800 <marybee> “Glasses are often referred to as the exemplar of a product that addresses a disability, yet with little or no social stigma attached” - (book: design meets disability) - not if the glasses are half-inch thick -14 diopters.  https://t.co/f9TiwW0Qva
1343679391574994946 2020-12-29 06:05:05 +0800 <marybee> 8yo: ok google, say something rude  Google: what rhymes with ‘plucking bell’ Me: 😱😳  https://t.co/8isNOv4fKc
1343678837176070149 2020-12-29 06:02:53 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie Hahaha. I better get into the habit then 😃 I’ll see your avatar on the apple watch next week 😉
1343678395767525379 2020-12-29 06:01:08 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie Just put on charge 😄 it should be ready to go in the morning.
1343677698997153793 2020-12-29 05:58:22 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie Lol I hear you. I was doing daily morning walks but then stopped last week! I shall start again from tomorrow. I will join you for the daily step count.
1343676903257944065 2020-12-29 05:55:12 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie I’ll join you. I am terrible at doing this alone. Are you trying anything particular?
1343675694027591680 2020-12-29 05:50:24 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie You can do this!! I’m here for encouragement and support! (and an occasional kick up the backside for when you need to get moving 😂). I fully expect the same from you 😊
1343640687317835778 2020-12-29 03:31:18 +0800 <marybee> @puddlelogic @cathyholloway1 @nadiaberthouze @e_mln_e @AnaTajadura @AnaJavornik @ousmet @anja_thieme
1343640685778497541 2020-12-29 03:31:17 +0800 <marybee> Our #CHI2021 workshop aims to explore the approaches, methods, and tools for technology design for the evolving sensory needs and embodied experiences of disabled people through life-course. Workshop details at @GDIHub:  https://t.co/lXohjj26y0. Position paper deadline 21 Feb.
1340681709407367168 2020-12-20 23:33:22 +0800 <marybee> @nbhansen I haven’t a clue. How does one qualify as a Santa?
1340676955998482434 2020-12-20 23:14:29 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie Ha! A new learning experience for us all then
1340675034671697926 2020-12-20 23:06:51 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie I LOVE this outsider’s perspective on Christmas happenings!!!
1340674781654507524 2020-12-20 23:05:51 +0800 <marybee> I am down for a secret Sheikh for Eid!!
1340337864391966720 2020-12-20 00:47:03 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie I am supposed to babysit my niece and nephews for a couple of days. I have no idea what Tier 4 means for this.
1340336614388719618 2020-12-20 00:42:05 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie 😞
1340284309874368514 2020-12-19 21:14:15 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie Hahaha... it’s all good. But I’d take the dream as a good sign of getting a cat soon 😄 my husband will just have to get used to having two moody, demanding yet adorable things in the house 🤪
1340205290852118528 2020-12-19 16:00:15 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie I had a dream that I adopted a gorgeous white and ginger cat named Apples 😂😂 there were cuddles and tears of joy.... and then my husband left me 😂😂
1339148123411767297 2020-12-16 17:59:27 +0800 <marybee> Very excited for my upcoming project with @cathyholloway1 and @BeTheMagpie at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London. We will be reaching out to east London blind and partially sighted community to work with us in the new year. More details will be out soon. @uclic @GDIHub
1338411838275543040 2020-12-14 17:13:43 +0800 <marybee> @kmstorer @Google Congratulations. Sounds exciting! Looking forward to reading your paper.
1337710130444562432 2020-12-12 18:45:23 +0800 <marybee> @Trundles_bot Thanks @Trundles_bot. Is this really a bot account?
1337704993890164737 2020-12-12 18:24:58 +0800 <marybee> Hivemind, any thoughts on how to workshop my thoughts on “what the hell am I doing with my life?” Google has not been helpful this morning. Help!! #phdchat #phdlife
1337470662743633924 2020-12-12 02:53:49 +0800 <marybee> @itisimrankhan You are not the only one :-)
1337368327623225351 2020-12-11 20:07:11 +0800 <marybee> It's Friday and the #impostersyndrome is getting the best of me :( #phdlife
1336940921737383937 2020-12-10 15:48:49 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie because  these have charactertistics which are more ‘diverse’ in terms of cognitive and developmental capabilities than ‘neurotypical’ @zuleimamorgado is our in-house expert on neurodiversity. ☺️
1336939498970771456 2020-12-10 15:43:10 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie I attended a seminar recently which suggested that we are all neurodiverse. I understand your point that It’s easier to grasp on the concept through understanding autism spectrum and other learning and behavioural difficulties..
1336736700161290242 2020-12-10 02:17:19 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie Amazing! Congrats 🥳
1336045384083402753 2020-12-08 04:30:16 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie So so cool! Is there one? Naturally it has to be cut out and framed! 😀
1336001073073491968 2020-12-08 01:34:12 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie This AMAZING!!
1334890945972752387 2020-12-05 00:02:57 +0800 <marybee> Took me some time to find it 😬 #UXfail  https://t.co/u3o25Yydl8
1334865849430274048 2020-12-04 22:23:13 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie Thank you! I've ordered some red and green PLA :D so exciting!
1334841637365837828 2020-12-04 20:47:01 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie yep! we also printed an igloo :D looks pretty cool with a light inside.. would have loved it to be transparent or less opaque though with little people :D haha we = me and Ahsan :D
1334841162843230213 2020-12-04 20:45:08 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie Not transparent 👎🏿  https://t.co/KIC65ZbPMq
1334840792146464768 2020-12-04 20:43:39 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie sounds amazing! I'll try to find a different manufacturer for the PLA.
1334839646916915200 2020-12-04 20:39:06 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie Thank you! I wanted to make transparent baubles but the transparent PLA printed fully opaque :(
1334838580246614017 2020-12-04 20:34:52 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie I love this!! Can you share the stl for the advent calendar? thanks xx
1334819372301496320 2020-12-04 19:18:32 +0800 <marybee> @haleemahsadiaa hear, hear!
1334766958504517632 2020-12-04 15:50:16 +0800 <marybee> Absolutely brilliant and so heartwarming to see such great teachers! He is the best teacher indeed!
1334764057279262722 2020-12-04 15:38:44 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie That’s true!
1334763658405175300 2020-12-04 15:37:09 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie Aww!! So jealous! All we got was rain, all night 🥴
1333496385568710662 2020-12-01 03:41:28 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie it's a thing of beauty!
1331949326210396163 2020-11-26 21:14:00 +0800 <marybee> It’s probably the sad combination increasing cold weather and lockdown 2.0 that led me to dig out this notepad today! #phdlife  https://t.co/JZHVqCV7AC
1331555988386811906 2020-11-25 19:11:01 +0800 <marybee> 😂😂😂 couldn’t agree more.
1329874454420336641 2020-11-21 03:49:12 +0800 <marybee> @cecaholic @alicook_ Well done @alicook_ ! Hope you celebrate tomorrow 🎊
1329542608616628224 2020-11-20 05:50:34 +0800 <marybee> The #chi2021 memes are totally making up for the crappy reviews 😂🥴
1329541718761410567 2020-11-20 05:47:02 +0800 <marybee> @rogueCHI Oh fuck! Indeed. 🥸
1328429183127728129 2020-11-17 04:06:12 +0800 <marybee> @itisimrankhan I’m very sorry for your loss. Lost my dad to cancer 2 years ago. It’s the worst. Fuck cancer indeed.
1326573591341768704 2020-11-12 01:12:45 +0800 <marybee> @alicook_ You have done so well so far! You can do it!!!  https://t.co/zdeLmxFPJV
1326106461718650880 2020-11-10 18:16:32 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie this is one of the saddest things i've seen this year
1325847840187420675 2020-11-10 01:08:52 +0800 <marybee> @sycynliu Thanks so much! Very best of luck 😊
1325444047109021698 2020-11-08 22:24:21 +0800 <marybee> @JASONWILSHERMIL @ace_midlands @ShapeArts @AnneMarieTasker @MadeWithMany_ @ace_national This is amazing!! Thank you for creating and sharing this.
1325146249020936192 2020-11-08 02:41:00 +0800 <marybee> @sycynliu Hi @sycynliu best of luck!! Will the dissertation defence be streamed on Zoom as a webinar and can people request to join?
1325046752643338241 2020-11-07 20:05:38 +0800 <marybee> @BryansQuest Hiya, I was wondering if you meant to attach an image or video to this tweet?
1322590930168414209 2020-11-01 01:27:04 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie Congratulations 🥳
1322129273495453699 2020-10-30 18:52:37 +0800 <marybee> Search for a human skeleton or summon a ghost using Google #AugmentedReality models. Boo!  https://t.co/rMU6O9ZtIP
1321910824991182848 2020-10-30 04:24:35 +0800 <marybee> @itisimrankhan True, but they say the body ‘advises’ the govt on religious matters. I understand what you mean though.
1321898061141053443 2020-10-30 03:33:52 +0800 <marybee> @itisimrankhan Well done! Everyone has a right to worship their religion anywhere on earth. On a side note, can students in madrassah’s be not blown up please?
1321725411886272512 2020-10-29 16:07:49 +0800 <marybee> @nehakumar @munmun10 @Dr_Inkster @naslundj @SachinPendse Sounds great! Look forward to a recording of this session.
1321554541154836482 2020-10-29 04:48:50 +0800 <marybee> Great to see attendance from across the world at #assets2020. It has been amazing!!  https://t.co/UtGzmYW8A1

1321468196801679363 2020-10-28 23:05:44 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie I know! I realised this week that I am already slipping into the deep darkness of depression. The lack of sun definitely exacerbates the low mood.
1321462089974775810 2020-10-28 22:41:28 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie @IncognitoPengy The rain doesn’t help at all! But Ahsan and I have been going to the park for a bit whenever the sun is out. It does help to see the outside world. Don’t force yourself to work, take some rest and come back to it when you are feeling better. It helps me sometimes.
1321112648658882560 2020-10-27 23:32:55 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie Cool! You should aim for it next year. It's amazing!  https://t.co/uGtc8zh6fY
1321111914857062405 2020-10-27 23:30:00 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie Aww! Thanks! are you at ASSETS? Honestly, I have a feeling I might pass out as soon as I am asked a question lol.. won't be the worst thing though!
1321111234075394049 2020-10-27 23:27:17 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie oh! I may just order one today then if I don't pass out from this anxiety-induced headache. 🥴
1321106395215876101 2020-10-27 23:08:04 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie Omg yes! On the brink of a breakdown so this was much needed.
1321073028273496064 2020-10-27 20:55:28 +0800 <marybee> Today we're designing social interactions in @ScratchTeam and my 8 yo comes up with this gem! I am pretty sure that's how most of his social interactions begin. On the plus side, that's a good use of a forever loop!  https://t.co/sSy8tz0kty

1320759597028827137 2020-10-27 00:10:01 +0800 <marybee> @MaiShehaly I know. It's tough enough with the pandemic as is! We've been going to the local park every day when it hasn't been pouring down :) Also, the week is not over yet!
1320743944800620544 2020-10-26 23:07:49 +0800 <marybee> @colegleason @clb5590 I agree! Glad I dealt with part of it while recording the presentation video so now can enjoy the conference.
1320743141180379142 2020-10-26 23:04:37 +0800 <marybee> Really enjoyed this presentation! The content was very well-structured and the visuals were brilliant! #ASSETS2020
1320742513808936962 2020-10-26 23:02:08 +0800 <marybee> @jeffbigham @tjvguerreiro 😂 thanks!
1320742263929143299 2020-10-26 23:01:08 +0800 <marybee> @liltove Same!!
1320742169871863822 2020-10-26 23:00:46 +0800 <marybee> @jeffbigham @tjvguerreiro That's very cool! My 8-yo has used up his screen time and now kicking the ball around as I try to engage with the presentations and avoid getting hit in the head. I doubt he'd want to sit down and watch the conference though. 😞
1320741130682720264 2020-10-26 22:56:38 +0800 <marybee> It's half-term in the UK and schools are off. How are other parents managing childcare while attending #ASSETS2020?
1320727885167140868 2020-10-26 22:04:00 +0800 <marybee> @LeonaHolloway20 yayy! I'm excited to hear more about your work on COVID-19 mentioned in the keynote.
1320727350179438593 2020-10-26 22:01:52 +0800 <marybee> I'm wohoo-ing! in my living room right now!! YEAH!! #ASSETS2020  https://t.co/gGlRbINtuh

1317507242762055681 2020-10-18 00:46:19 +0800 <marybee> @ankharrufa Cool setup!! I need to find a similar working set up for a sitting/standing desk.

1309545539151761408 2020-09-26 01:29:21 +0800 <marybee> @itisimrankhan Such shame.
1309534852291735552 2020-09-26 00:46:53 +0800 <marybee> @serayibrahim Is the drone part of the installation?
1309527865046818816 2020-09-26 00:19:07 +0800 <marybee> This is awful! #snapchat AR filters are great fun but can be quite disturbing for children and vulnerable people who may not be able to understand when something is real/AR.  https://t.co/hDDKSMAoJr
1306194584322662400 2020-09-16 19:33:51 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie Lol. Nothing works thesedays 🤦🏽‍♀️

1306013248567865345 2020-09-16 07:33:17 +0800 <marybee> @e_mln_e True true
1304465064800464898 2020-09-12 01:01:21 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie Ah! okay.
1304450284572336128 2020-09-12 00:02:38 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie What is this? I want to do it too!
1304005400346451968 2020-09-10 18:34:49 +0800 <marybee> @canyaimam It's the standard operating procedure here. For everyone's safety, schools can ask a child to not attend school if suspected COVID-19. I don't disagree with it but there needs to be a proper online learning system in place so those in quarantine can stay up to date.
1303861462763540480 2020-09-10 09:02:51 +0800 <marybee> And wait for the results. He will also miss school until his result is received. The school has no online learning system in place so he is likely to fall behind his peers in class and will have to deal with added stress because of this.
1303861461517848576 2020-09-10 09:02:51 +0800 <marybee> Btw, any parent who has children in school right now knows that there is no effective social distancing happening at schools. There are no testing sites locally (in Southeast London) so now he has to travel half way across the country to be tested for COVID-19.
1303861460167274499 2020-09-10 09:02:51 +0800 <marybee> Nephew got sent home from school for coughing, he says he was running and choked that’s why he coughed. He did not have a continuous cough or temperature. The panicked response from the school without assessment shows how unprepared the schools are to deal with COVID-19.
1303819188860006401 2020-09-10 06:14:53 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie The ABC ones
1303817294284558336 2020-09-10 06:07:21 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie I think the multivitamins I got from Holland and Barrett are working.
1303815782405672961 2020-09-10 06:01:20 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie I feel ya! I had a moment of immense excitement when I spotted some baby hair growing in my bald spots 😂🥳
1303815092434239490 2020-09-10 05:58:36 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie youth? :)
1303810044648017921 2020-09-10 05:38:32 +0800 <marybee> @itisimrankhan I wholeheartedly support public hanging of such monsters. They should be dragged out on the roads and publicly raped so they remember never to look at a woman again.
1303056814536364033 2020-09-08 03:45:28 +0800 <marybee> @DilishaBP I wish lol
1302944119388622849 2020-09-07 20:17:40 +0800 <marybee> Apparently, I've inherited $4.5 million which johnpaulco**@gmail.com will transfer to me on cashable ATM MasterCard if I send him my all biodata 😂
1302943279017857030 2020-09-07 20:14:19 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie yayy! Congrats! 🥳
1302327600061255682 2020-09-06 03:27:50 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie Hahahhaa yes, yes it is! I feel like I have aged 30 years in 10 🙈
1302327273798983680 2020-09-06 03:26:32 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie 😂 thanks. Good old days.
1302326172227899398 2020-09-06 03:22:10 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie Not the traditional red in this ceremony (I had two receptions 1 year apart) but lots of jewellery and make up, here goes! 😂  https://t.co/PxpS47JXUG
1302324558461046784 2020-09-06 03:15:45 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie I love this!! You look gorgeous 🥰
1301932745472516096 2020-09-05 01:18:49 +0800 <marybee> Now that the schools are re-opening, as a mobility specialist for #blind and partially sighted people, would you like to share your experience of the #COVID_19 lockdown and social distancing on your work?  https://t.co/oP8nKHG1Zh Please RT @HabVIUK_org_uk
1301531305075716097 2020-09-03 22:43:39 +0800 <marybee> @xandvt All the reasons for not wanting to go back to the office.
1301121164966797319 2020-09-02 19:33:54 +0800 <marybee> @BeTheMagpie love it!! That would be perfect! A self-entertaining baby without having to give birth. Sounds like boss baby movie :D  https://t.co/LwgWI2urho
