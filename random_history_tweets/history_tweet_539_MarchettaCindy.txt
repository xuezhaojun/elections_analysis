1308176216696991744 2020-09-22 06:48:09 +0800 <MarchettaCindy> @rite2right @realDonaldTrump I'm in fourth stage kidney failure.  I've been locked away in my house since early January because I watch the news and I seen the virus is coming. Trump played it down, you know that for a fact. I have no trust in a person that can't tell the truth. They are worth nothing to me.
1308155750259331072 2020-09-22 05:26:49 +0800 <MarchettaCindy> @Cynster2002 @rite2right @realDonaldTrump Look at yourself first. Trump is no God

1307690535444983815 2020-09-20 22:38:14 +0800 <MarchettaCindy> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump That would be un American, Trump was impeached he should not be able to run for president are to full the seat.

Don't worry nobody's going to take your guns, but if Trump wins it will cost you your life and others you love. That is the truth with 200 thousand dead from Trump lack of responsibility.
1307643588692643840 2020-09-20 19:31:41 +0800 <MarchettaCindy> @Acyn What Trump says about others he does himself. I've seen something like a white rock come flying of Trump nose while he was talking. The man is definitely snorting something.
1307392361849409536 2020-09-20 02:53:23 +0800 <MarchettaCindy> @LindseyGrahamSC Only one changing America is Trump. He wants people to hate each other, it's not going to happen. He hate America and loves money , Putin and himself.

1307059101319430145 2020-09-19 04:49:08 +0800 <MarchettaCindy> @SenTedCruz Trump won't do the right thing. We wouldn't be here if we had someone who thought about others than himself. Trump isn't this man and we are paying the price.
1307032311146450946 2020-09-19 03:02:41 +0800 <MarchettaCindy> @realDonaldTrump Trump playing to save his ass from jail. Vote him out make him pay for causing so much death and pain.

1306924801559334912 2020-09-18 19:55:28 +0800 <MarchettaCindy> @realDonaldTrump Trump didn't do shit to help stop the virus. He doesn't care about you are your family. Only thing he care about is saving his ass from going to jail after he leaves office.  That's the truth!!!
1306920662989185024 2020-09-18 19:39:02 +0800 <MarchettaCindy> @TODAYshow @NBCNews @PeterAlexander If Trump wins Putin wins that sample. Vote Trump and Putin out.

1301215347178188810 2020-09-03 01:48:08 +0800 <MarchettaCindy> @TrumpWarRoom Instead of talking  about Joe  listen to Trump talk about the Civil War and airplanes. We didn't have planes back then. That's crazy talk. Are was it a mistake?? People does make mistakes. Move on people this is making you look stupid.
1301212372791693313 2020-09-03 01:36:19 +0800 <MarchettaCindy> @LindseyGrahamSC It's sad that we don't have the politicians to speak out about the injustice of people. What happened to Dr. kings dream I'm hoping to God that these are the days that it comes true. Equal rights for all

1301140386463784960 2020-09-02 20:50:16 +0800 <MarchettaCindy> @realDonaldTrump You are not the president the people wants. Maybe the ones that has hate in the heart. But most of us wants peace and someone that knows how to save the people not kill them off one by one. Save America and vote Trump out.
1301138232835440640 2020-09-02 20:41:43 +0800 <MarchettaCindy> @realDonaldTrump Trump is losing faster than anyone I ever seen before. Low IQ is the blame but Trump blames others.

1300919762889965569 2020-09-02 06:13:36 +0800 <MarchettaCindy> @RepMattGaetz @GenFlynn It's a search for the truth since the Republicans can't tell the truth.
1300892499008016384 2020-09-02 04:25:15 +0800 <MarchettaCindy> @RepMattGaetz @RepAdamSchiff I wouldn't trust you but a bottle of beer.

1300835567882641409 2020-09-02 00:39:02 +0800 <MarchettaCindy> @realDonaldTrump You can try and hide the truth, but what see is telling a different story. We see you can't walk well, and can't pronounce words properly. Tell all of stroke. Just like me Trump you're not gonna live forever.
1300781389642637312 2020-09-01 21:03:45 +0800 <MarchettaCindy> @realDonaldTrump @NBA Trump Virus is killing people everyday, looks like he doesn't care. Vote the ASS out.
