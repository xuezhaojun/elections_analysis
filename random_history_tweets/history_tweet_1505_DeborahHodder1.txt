But don‚Äôt forget that Medicare and Social Security is an investment and about 10% comes out of people‚Äôs paychecks for about 50 years. It‚Äôs like a 401k- forcing people to save.

Arizona just had rain last weekend. But we haven‚Äôt had rain in Phoenix for about seven or eight months! Australia had so many fires it wiped out 1/3 of all the koalas

Perhaps instead of the church giving directly to the people they should donate to a certain charity in their neighborhood so the funds can be tracked.  Many organizations like Saint Vincent de Paul give to the poor.

1336966654287204352 2020-12-10 17:31:04 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @h82w8cfm @peepsvoiceradio @ResisterDude That‚Äôs why a committee needs to be selected to go after all the corruption. It would be similar to the Mueller report so the president doesn‚Äôt have to be bothered nor blamed for indicting.
1336965715111288832 2020-12-10 17:27:20 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @kalmantibs @ResisterDude Someone recently made a great case about why Sally Yates should be the AG. The main reason is because she has experience and she knows a lot of the people in the justice department.  That will help mend and get the ball rolling more swiftly
1336964256906932225 2020-12-10 17:21:33 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @glennkirschner2 @Ozarkskygirl @JoeBiden Perhaps Biden will put together a committee for an investigation similar to the Mueller report.  Quite a few indictments occurred
1336878658800111617 2020-12-10 11:41:24 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @wendy_hinman @dunecat1 Someone explained that it would be best to have an AG that has some experience &amp; know the people in the justice department. Doug Jones is a great guy but he just doesn‚Äôt have enough experience as an AG.  Sally Yates should be the next AG.

1336697844296781832 2020-12-09 23:42:55 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @girlsreallyrule I think all three candidates would make a great Attorney General. Doug Jones has a demeanor that is similar to Biden‚Äôs and I think the country would tend to support him because of that

1336695512393662466 2020-12-09 23:33:39 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @RepKatiePorter I would love to see @katieporteroc Take the place of Kamala Harris‚Äô seat in the Senate.

Currently you have to be at war with another country before it‚Äôs called treason. But then if there‚Äôs a Civil War I suppose it could be called treason if someone incites violence to start one

1336526229944455171 2020-12-09 12:20:59 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @teriwessels1 @azcentral Yeah potus already raised $250 million in donations &amp; 75% of the money he gets to keep and do with anyway he wants.  Well, I wonder if he‚Äôll pay off that $400 million debt with it?
1336525472738381825 2020-12-09 12:17:58 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @turbophan7 @azcentral I think one of T‚Äôs concerns is that now that the election is finalized &amp; states certified today-it will be harder for him to get the extra money from his base. Can you believe POTUS already received $250million in donations to help him pay 4 lawsuits-75% goes into his pocket!
1336524199574163456 2020-12-09 12:12:55 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @azcentral Well, after today‚Äôs SCOTUS ruling ‚Äì ‚Äì one sentence was written that basically said ‚Äúyour games up‚Äù to potus. The Trump followers hopefully will calm down and realize that they‚Äôll have their chance again in four years

1336455179936223232 2020-12-09 07:38:39 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> OK. I just heard that SCOTUS doesn‚Äôt want to look at any so-called fraud cases of the election. The game is over &amp; Biden won the election fair &amp; square with a significant lead in each state-more than Trump received in 2016. Today is the deadline for all states to certify-Dec. 8

1331069633021976577 2020-11-24 10:58:25 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @ektaka @maddow Why didn‚Äôt the military block the destruction of the OC135B spy planes?  It was an illegal action! Congress was supposed to vote on such an order! How appalling!  It Sounds very convenient for a certain country! And, What what was the meeting all about today with Pompeo?
1331068480364298240 2020-11-24 10:53:50 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @hugolowell Have the OC135B spy planes already been destroyed or can we get the military to block Trump from doing it?  Congress was supposed to vote on whether or not he could withdraw from the treaty &amp; destroy those planes! Make T sell a hotel or golf corses to pay for it!

She spoke for about 20 minutes on how the POTUS is destroying our only OC135B spy planes to make it impossible to check on Countries that test nukes, etc. &amp; he pulled out of the open skies treaty w no vote of congress!
1331064462254559232 2020-11-24 10:37:52 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @CNBC I wonder what Giuliani‚Äôs insurance is against the President?
1331062565749751808 2020-11-24 10:30:20 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @MaddowBlog Congress is supposed to decide whether the sky watch treaty is abandoned /OC135B planes destroyed &amp; they were not consulted. I think Trump should have his bank account frozen-pay for 2 new planes just like Di Joy should pay for all of the sorting machines that he had destroyed!

It‚Äôs not 1/20/21 yet &amp; the plan hasn‚Äôt been totally developed. I‚Äôm thinking it will look something like-corporations sponsor the students &amp; pay their loans as well as school districts, police departments or something like a WPA program

He said it would be for the first four years ‚Äì two years would be for junior college. It sounds like the debt won‚Äôt be paid off from before 2021 unless they perhaps do public work (like a WPA?) to pay part of it off

1327945312544059392 2020-11-15 20:03:29 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @ViewsPlusNews @glennkirschner2 I see a lot of cracks in the laws that need to be firmed up such as there needs to be tighter vetting of an incoming president such as making it mandatory to show taxes. All Senators should show taxes before &amp; after they are in office to show if any bribes were paid to them, etc
1327942033030352897 2020-11-15 19:50:27 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @BlackPhysicists @glennkirschner2 I wonder why Ford pardoned Nixon. What was it for him? Isn‚Äôt that one reason why Ford was never reelected?

1327935751799984128 2020-11-15 19:25:29 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @cogitounboxed @glennkirschner2 So if someone has to answer questions under oath after being pardoned and they lie under oath, isn‚Äôt that perjury &amp; the pardon doesn‚Äôt matter anymore for that particular case and could get them up to five years in prison?

Perhaps you didn‚Äôt know that. And, New York adored Hillary Clinton. She really did a lot of good for the people!  Biden/Harris did just fine in New York.

By the way, if you‚Äôre not of the left nor the right but in in the middle politically what does that make you? I think it‚Äôs called being a moderate-like Biden.

Plus, say some Rep senators vote to impeach?  It could be a tool to slow down any more progress to block Biden‚Äôs election transition

An impeachment would have been too distracting &amp; may have swayed some from voting for Biden.  However, if the two senators are elected in early January they may be able to vote on an impeachment by January 19 if an impeachment began now?

There are some desperate people without jobs in Texas who might like to get a chunk of the $1 million dollars and falsely say there was voter fraud.  But you are so right Robin, where did the $1 million come from ‚Äì tax payer money or private money?
1326342348779843584 2020-11-11 09:53:52 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @thedailybeast There‚Äôs a lot of desperate people out there governor Patrick. Some don‚Äôt have jobs &amp; no food on the table. Yes, some of them might lie and say there was voter fraud for a share of $1 million.  I call that bribery!!!
1326331546035396608 2020-11-11 09:10:57 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @kylegriffin1 He seems to be allocating right now. Barr came out of the woodwork last night &amp; T‚Äôs been tweeting a lot. He‚Äôs already planning his campaign for 2024., I wonder how much campaign money he will get over the next four years before he decides that he‚Äôs not running after all in 2023
1326330989480562688 2020-11-11 09:08:44 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @JoyceWhiteVance Hi Joyce.  I had a rotator cuff injury ‚Äì ‚Äì my left armpit and I had a nice small pillow that seemed to fit perfectly underneath my arm. Most of the time I just slept on my back.  I loosened caps from water bottles and positioned them in ways that I could lift with one arm
1326202908237459458 2020-11-11 00:39:47 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @jerrysaltz I received 9 hours of sleep 2 nights ago but now Barr is back at it.  He wants to have the states investigated for voter fraud Prior to the states being certified. It‚Äôs never been done before. That rule needs to be struck down.  The goal Seems to be to drag the election out!
1326202115606261762 2020-11-11 00:36:38 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @ElieNYC Can the arguments be seen on TV Or heard?
1326201466248261635 2020-11-11 00:34:03 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @JoshuaGroover @barberseansee There is evidence that Russia did collude. They are still trying their best to do so. Why do you think there are so many bots from Russia on Twitter?  If you‚Äôre up late because you can‚Äôt sleep due to stressful politics you notice that at about 3 AM the bots come out in droves
1326200249585528833 2020-11-11 00:29:13 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @mossrock42 @barberseansee Wow! Good point! So the president says he wants to run in 2024 and have people send him millions of dollars to campaign 4 years out.  Interesting ü§î
1326199757992161282 2020-11-11 00:27:16 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @carroindamix @barberseansee Thankfully we know that Joe Biden has a clean track record but yes, in the future we need to vet very thoroughly any incoming president. Have them show their taxes. That‚Äôs a must! And, absolutely suspend any businesses for the 4 or 8 years w no family control of them/independent
1326186467090067457 2020-11-10 23:34:27 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Right! Joe Biden is the president elect. The last four years were not great because of the dysfunction of this government!  So yes, let‚Äôs make America great again!
1326185359923843073 2020-11-10 23:30:03 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @realDonaldTrump Pfizer is an independent European company &amp; based on science. They called Joe Biden with their results not Trump. Joe put together a committee of 12. What happened to trumps committee that seem to have ended months ago? Let me
1326183640456257537 2020-11-10 23:23:13 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @AnneFlournoy @marykmiller5 @phillipdyte @ryanjreilly @edbott @jennycohn1 Thanks! I am following @jennycohn1 and I already replied about my nervousness with what Barr plans to do‚Äîinspect states for voting fraud before states certify.  And a key voter inspector resigned because of it!
1326180071179051008 2020-11-10 23:09:02 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @NewKevinBacon @jennycohn1 Yes!  I hope you can testify in the he new Congress.  BTW I am really worried about Barr‚Äôs latest suspicious strategy of investigating voter fraud before the states are called &amp; certified.  And too many key people are resigning (Richard Pilger).
1326061922404294656 2020-11-10 15:19:33 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @barney1776 @DrDinD I think they are referring to absentee ballots

1326038878990422017 2020-11-10 13:48:00 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @dancecat1970 @BillyBaldwin Plus, Pfizer personally called Biden to give him the news. I think they feel he deserves the credit!
1326038381298503681 2020-11-10 13:46:01 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @HeschRhonda @BillyBaldwin Bannon got caught scamming people into thinking they were donating to building an extra section of wall. I wonder what happened to all of the border wall money from the taxpayers? What about the 2016 inauguration money surplus?  Covid19 Stimulus money $billions?
1326037427916451841 2020-11-10 13:42:14 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @BillyBaldwin Billy, do you realize that doesn‚Äôt make sense?  Over 50 million dollars was donated to Harrison and McGrath so obviously the elections were not rigged.  And there‚Äôs this in AZ:  https://t.co/ANbct4MyQE

1325964211449524224 2020-11-10 08:51:17 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @phillipdyte @ryanjreilly @edbott Here‚Äôs a great argument on MSNBC-If the election was rigged why were the Republican senators re-elected when so much money had been funneled into the Lindsey Graham/ Harrison seat for example or for McConnell‚Äôs seat? In Az 75K Navajos &amp; Hopi‚Äôs voted for Biden &amp; many on horseback
1325962409811406848 2020-11-10 08:44:08 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @EktaShahMD How true!  I just suggested some white male Republican cabinet members!  Oh wait! I suggested Ana Navarro and Susan Rice for cabinet positions too.  I‚Äôm sure Kamala Harris will have some great input too!  Please do not select Paul Ryan. He wanted to axe SS/Medicare
1325960923568250880 2020-11-10 08:38:13 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @goldenheart1995 @dpfdpf I hope Susan Rice is in there somewhere
1325960728705036288 2020-11-10 08:37:27 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @NotoriousRED2 @dpfdpf I agree. We need more women in the cabinet
1325960519665119237 2020-11-10 08:36:37 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @CathyJoeGPT @dpfdpf I think that Romney is well spoken and would make a great Secretary of State or head some committee but Paul Ryan wanted to dismantle SS and Obamacare.  I would say no to him.
1325959967585656832 2020-11-10 08:34:26 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @riotwomennn @dpfdpf There are some Republicans I think would do a great job to unify the country. Jeff Flake? Ana Navarro? Mitt? Glenn Kirshner for AG.  I think there are some grudges against Kasich but he seems OK. Ryan wanted to dismantle SS.

1325845544585998336 2020-11-10 00:59:45 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @MelissaGill999 @RightWingWatch I feel there are a lot more people that are spiritual but also believe in science-many people who revere quantum physics may also be believers of metaphysics but any religion that judges others is not spiritual! A gay friend‚Äôs evangelist family claims she is of the devil. Sad
1325839340593770496 2020-11-10 00:35:06 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @ArtReview_ Personally, I don‚Äôt like pretty art. I like art that affects me emotionally. My own work is very surreal and expressive!  For example, some favorite artists are: Jim Dine, Debra Fritts, Van Gogh, Kathe Kollwitz, Alice Neel, Roy De Forest and David Hockney
1325837728416632846 2020-11-10 00:28:41 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @DWUhlfelderLaw @marylonerganart I agree that @GSAEmily should help Biden‚Äôs transition But how many of you feel that she‚Äôs afraid she could really anger the President?  Who knows, maybe she received threats from some of the base.  Personally, I would resign.  Is she contracted?

And good morning to all of you from Phoenix, Arizona where the temperature is 54 degrees‚Äîstaying focused this AM on election results in AZ.  It‚Äôs a nail biter W about 80K more ballots to count‚Äîfingers crossed we hold our lead for 11 electoral votes.  We‚Äôre turning BLUE üíô

It‚Äôs vascular so that means little blood vessels in your body starts to burst causing little strokes, killing organs. Even those with light cases can end up w serious pre-existing conditions!
1325575786737393665 2020-11-09 07:07:50 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @C_Stroop @AuthorKimberley I loved it
1325517157841526784 2020-11-09 03:14:52 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @sarah_meinzer @cogitounboxed I agree! Why can‚Äôt we all get along? Maybe there should be a committee to filter through all the conspiracy theories and get them resolved.  We pretty much all want the same things such as food, shelter, medical, fair wages and education + ‚ù§Ô∏è
1325516395791097856 2020-11-09 03:11:50 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @C_Stroop @AuthorKimberley So you don‚Äôt like that Biden went to the cemetery to pray where his wife, daughter and Bo were buried before his speech? How much more sadness does that man have to go through? Bo was 46 at death &amp; Biden will be the 46th President.  It sounds like an omen from God‚Äîto me.
1325485306368290817 2020-11-09 01:08:18 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @TraversonJanet @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt think the president realizes that when a state is ‚Äúcalled‚Äù it is because more people voted for one person versus the other and the other could never catch up ‚Äì even with the military ballots (absentee ballots)!
1325482225467420672 2020-11-09 00:56:03 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @ZachandMattShow The universal wage guarantee should be $2000/mo to cover rent, food, medical ‚Äì all the basics. Soon, about 1/3 of the work force will be replaced by artificial intelligence. Whoever wants to make more than 2K could work to do it if they can find the job.   https://t.co/5Ls1dCYWqf

BTW was it Fox News that spread the word not to wear a mask during this epidemic?
1325462478512218113 2020-11-08 23:37:35 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @john_godish I read that Fox News actually showed New York, Philadelphia and Georgia people dancing in the street so I thought OK. Let me see if Murdoch got tired of all the trump propaganda and the media station changed its tune. Nope. The talk became...about illegal votes.
1325460858072264706 2020-11-08 23:31:09 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @queenthiab @maddow Oh yes, and MSNBC is smack in the middle for bias.  To me, that means they‚Äôre one of the most fair news stations.
1325460572704399360 2020-11-08 23:30:01 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @queenthiab @maddow I also noted that NPR is one of the least biased sources as well as BBC.  Air America is probably another good one As well as Republican-based news such as the Wall Street Journal
1325455001808891904 2020-11-08 23:07:52 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @queenthiab @maddow It doesn‚Äôt take long to fact check. I wish a lot of the Republicans would do that. It seems that many listen to each other‚Äòs conspiracy theories instead. There are many women who claim T sexually abused them.  Biden has no such claims:  https://t.co/fgBdHW9pLD
1325453602987495425 2020-11-08 23:02:19 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @queenthiab @maddow A site that I fact check is snopes.  I found this article that shows Trump sent the pedophile lies to about 84 million people but it also has another source on there:   https://t.co/p6pwUQyXES

I live in Phoenix and Alex Jones was spouting some slanderous remarks w a bull horn, hopefully not distracting the vote counters. Fingers crossed that GA &amp; AZ go blue!
1325443584691113984 2020-11-08 22:22:30 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @debrafinch I‚Äôll bet the FBI and the CIA will be hopping on parler too.  I‚Äôm all for free speech as long as people do not incite violence.  I hope they realize that if you shout fire in a crowded theater it‚Äôs against the law.

No you don‚Äôt have to lose your Social Security by 2023. I really don‚Äôt think Trump wanted to become president again for four more years. Surely he knew that by saying such things he would disengage millions of people

1325211317100138498 2020-11-08 06:59:33 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @Susan_Hennessey I was reading about it. Apparently the Democrat was an independent and changed to Democrat. He‚Äôs a favorite of the Alaskans and Sullivan committed some controversy that the people don‚Äôt like.
1325210406751629318 2020-11-08 06:55:56 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @EmeraldRobinson OK here Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on with the Senate race in Alaska, The Democrat was an independent and is a favorite of the people and Sullivan committed some kind of controversy so The Democrats may have another senator soon.  Georgia may give the Dems two more senators in January!

Well, I heard that when there is a pandemic people feel better for some reason when they believe in conspiracies. Plz Do your fact checking. Let‚Äôs stay positive and loving-learn to work together &amp; let‚Äôs not be so partisan
1325169959371091970 2020-11-08 04:15:13 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> Fox was doing a great job showing the celebrations in the cities-then they started talking about dead people voting &amp; how the president wants to investigate Clark County Nevada because T said 9000 people voted that were out of the area ‚Äì ‚Äì ridiculous!  No more conspiracies plz!
1325157630814289922 2020-11-08 03:26:14 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @BeckEMouse @AdamParkhomenko You l‚Äôll love Steve Kornacki. On MSNBC he‚Äôs a mathematical genius!  I think they are less biased station because they always have Republicans on to give the counter arguments. Also they never did call Arizona like Fox News did
1325156945720872961 2020-11-08 03:23:30 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @thomasjwebb @AdamParkhomenko I really can‚Äôt blame the T supporters who watched stations like Fox News 24-7.  Trump was a reality TV star &amp; was very entertaining. They covered T‚Äôs rallies &amp; speeches more than any other stations. They even spouted propaganda talking points as Antifa &amp; fake news constantly-sad
1325152209860923392 2020-11-08 03:04:41 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @robbystarbuck Well, I think Fox News had the best ratings of any of the stations for four years so hopefully Murdoch and all the news staff was able to save their bucks and can Move on!
1325151705005109254 2020-11-08 03:02:41 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @SmakThis @ACTBrigitte Well, at least Tucker Carlson has a degree. He has a bachelors in history. He wanted to join the CIA and was denied So became a journalist. Hannity BTW doesn‚Äôt have a degree.   https://t.co/AjfnCyGnoa
1325150539097665543 2020-11-08 02:58:03 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @LucasScattolon @ACTBrigitte Sure FOX supported Trump. He was entertaining-he was a realitystar. You‚Äôll be OK. Remember Biden has been a senator since he was 29 and a VP. He knows how to run a country.  The rest of the world can now support us again &amp; that‚Äôs a good thing!

1325014231297662976 2020-11-07 17:56:24 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @rickhasen I just heard that Georgia won‚Äôt be able to certify the election until about November 20th. The recount has to happen first.  So, fingers crossed that AZ &amp; Nevada certify soon! BTW there are pockets of Biden supporters in Central Phoenix as well as Tucson!

After the 20 minutes he seemed to leave in a hurry.

1324827609532751873 2020-11-07 05:34:50 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @realDonaldTrump Most ballots did not come in after Election Day-it takes a while to count them. The only ones that come in after election day are ones where states were postmarked on election day and then you have the ballots coming in from the military-due today

There is the AZ Senate seat as well as Colorado so don‚Äôt the three new senators make a tied number of Senators.  And, there still could be some senators that win w mail-in ballot counts?
1324014859776786432 2020-11-04 23:45:16 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @michelleinbklyn Michelle, There will be a runoff election for Warnock and we added a Senator in AZ, and Colorado and Nikil Saval won the senate.  So far that‚Äôs 3 Senators &amp; it gives us a tie, right?  What about other cities still counting mail-in ballots that possibly affects the senate race?
1324013018569560065 2020-11-04 23:37:57 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @hmcghee What about Nikil Saval who won the Senate?  That gives us 3 Senators?  When Warnock wins the runoff vote that would give us the last of the Senators to get a majority

1323951000038699009 2020-11-04 19:31:30 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @_drei OK people, so how does that work if you have a tied senate?  Does that mean there would be no majority leader? And, would the vice president vote as the tie breaker?
1323949671727861760 2020-11-04 19:26:14 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @simondolan Simon, calling a state does not make it official until all the votes are counted. That‚Äôs why no one concedes until all R counted.  If districts to be counted are overwhelmingly Rep or Dem it can be assumed but not official    https://t.co/qEu56A8ykA

When the media calls the state it‚Äôs because there was a majority registered Democrats or Republican‚Äòs in a certain county that‚Äôs overwhelmingly one or the other but here‚Äôs an unbiased article about it:   https://t.co/qEu56A8ykA
1323945645187559426 2020-11-04 19:10:14 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @PhilWisher @simondolan The news media can call a state but it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs official so let‚Äôs not get all excited.  If a state has more registered Dems than Reps &amp; independents they most likely will be called a Democrat win‚ÄîIt‚Äôs not official until all votes are counted  https://t.co/qEu56A8ykA
1323944521202237440 2020-11-04 19:05:46 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @SunnygladeClose @simondolan OK. That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs official:   https://t.co/qEu56A8ykA
1323944351701979137 2020-11-04 19:05:05 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @SunnygladeClose @simondolan Just because the state is called doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs official. Signatures have to be validated, etc. Here‚Äôs an unbiased explanation:   https://t.co/qEu56A8ykA
1323942312947277824 2020-11-04 18:56:59 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @JoannaS27209973 @simondolan The mail in ballots in AZ have been counted prior to November 3 and during the day. At 1 AM Mountain standard time all the votes were counted in Arizona and Biden was ahead by over 100,000 votes. Where are you people getting your information? I live in Arizona

A lot of people don‚Äôt understand why the ballots can‚Äôt be counted before election Day‚Äîas they‚Äôve been counted in AZ prior to &amp; including Nov 3rd

1323292773982695426 2020-11-02 23:55:57 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @GeigerNews And I heard that DT buses people to the rallies and leaves them stranded after it.  That happened at four rallies in a row that were held really late at night in the cold!!!!
1323292212575178763 2020-11-02 23:53:43 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @hyemom10 @stone_circle A lot of people don‚Äôt live in the past. But if you want to get technical at one time there weren‚Äôt any parties Just just the Mayflower!

1323290870850875392 2020-11-02 23:48:23 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @DanScavino It‚Äôs really not fair. POTUS gets to take the Air Force one plane to go from place to place. Do you really think he pays for the use of it with his campaign funds? He is supposed to I believe.
1323290464657666048 2020-11-02 23:46:46 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @Sammypooh13 @AynRandPaulRyan I used to love to vote on voting day! This year I just wanted to get my vote in for Biden as soon as possible.  Be safe when you vote tomorrow!

1323272472293044226 2020-11-02 22:35:17 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @ry1980mcc @atensnut I read that it was a Boogaloo guy that burned down &amp; fired 30 rounds into the police station.  I wish people would read the unbiased news reports. PBS is good.  With Trump we‚Äôll lose our Social Security and Medicare by 2023 &amp; That $ came out of our wages
1323178743829991424 2020-11-02 16:22:50 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @RonaldKlain So the people at the Trump rally want the other doctor that just had an interview with RT to be their selection to understand about Covid19?  Yikes!  I‚Äôll take Dr Fauchi as the top medical adviser for Covid19

Isn‚Äôt it the Republicans that said they didn‚Äôt want to wear a mask because it took away their freedom? Is blocking this highway freedom?
1323017654005714946 2020-11-02 05:42:43 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @QueenOfGeele @CNN Hi Jamie from Canada! There are a lot of really good TV shows the come out of Canada such as the Expanse, Lost Girl, Orphan Black, Once Upon a Time, and way back...Highlander!
1322983537939656704 2020-11-02 03:27:09 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @CatintheHome @swank_shane @DarkWebWarrior The 1 great thing about Twitter is that many who watch Fox News get to see actual footage that they may not see aired on that mostly propaganda station.  I trust media sources of those who have a journalism degree. One of the most popular on FOX has no college degree-research it
1322982146026303489 2020-11-02 03:21:38 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @gapeech10 @swank_shane @FBI Does anyone know some of the FBI agents that are fairly high up that we‚Äôre from the Obama era That are still in place and has not been fired?
1322980359437348864 2020-11-02 03:14:32 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @RepublicanSwine I wouldn‚Äôt call the Maga People trash. I think they are just very uninformed and watch way too much Fox News 24 seven. Propaganda can do strange things to the brain. Even words like an Antifa (anti facism) or fake news stated over and over again can brainwash one!
1322979592273981440 2020-11-02 03:11:29 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> I‚Äôm glad this is the #1 trend!  People were asking last night why this didn‚Äôt trend as #1.  Maybe people were attending Halloween parties?  Once again, my answer to this dangerous trump caravan is, where were the helicopters? At least 1 vehicle crossed it‚Äôs line #TrumpTerroism
1322846188043825152 2020-11-01 18:21:23 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @GCDCBflo @JRehling How far is Butler from McKeesport, Irwin or Paintertown, Pa?

So Biden would come to the rescue of those stranded at the Trump Pennsylvania rally where the temperature is about 40 degrees

Harris was supposed to speak today in Texas and plans were changed due to that.  Where were the helicopters? And the police were out numbered.  Disgusting!

We need to spread the word that trump caravans tried to Force the Biden bus off the road when Kamala Harris went to Texas to speak. They outnumbered the police. Where were the helicopters? So =no rally

That‚Äôs not a fact because scientists are still learning about that but research said that many brains become compromised‚Äî making them 10 years older!
1322638759997796352 2020-11-01 04:37:08 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @kylegriffin1 I wonder how many of Trump‚Äôs rally goers from this week or last week will be sick at home with Covid19 and can‚Äôt even go to their voting place on Tuesday?  Isn‚Äôt it the Republicans that normally vote the day of the election?
1322638031912800256 2020-11-01 04:34:14 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @HKrassenstein So what can those people do in Texas Who dropped off their ballots in the drop off boxes?  Should They vote in person and then state that their ballot was jeopardized?

However, hasn‚Äôt the laws changed on how many votes it takes to do that?  The house of representatives makes the laws and if we take the Senate we could pass such a law‚ÄîChange it to a majority vote

1321301339889172494 2020-10-28 12:02:42 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @ericgarland OK. So if Kavanaugh is Eventually impeached and one or two other Supreme court justices were selected &amp; paid for by the mob does that mean the cases they voted for could be re-tried/tossed out? This is a hypothetical question

1321220710665121792 2020-10-28 06:42:19 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Right‚Äî so the proud boys &amp; Boogaloo people probably are the ones that signed up to vote for the 1st time this year in Michigan, and voted foe Trump‚Äì ‚Äì probably some are the same people that wanted to go after governor Whitmer.  20K new voters in an entire state is not that many.
1321219077508005888 2020-10-28 06:35:49 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @JDiamond1 @HillaryClinton How ridiculous that Biden would select Hillary Clinton as a supreme court justice. First of all you have to have five years experience I believe as a judge. Which by the way Amy Barrett only has three. Maybe it‚Äôs not a mandate but it should be

1320951030566191104 2020-10-27 12:50:42 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @RobTPhoto @ericgarland Can we see their taxes and find out how much money each senator has accrued in the past four years?
1320950739397562369 2020-10-27 12:49:33 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @ericgarland It‚Äôs interesting several Deutsche bank loan officers were found dead- supposedly suicide in the last year.  There are some interesting threads if you search Justice Kennedy on Twitter.
1320949030722048000 2020-10-27 12:42:45 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @cmclymer @physicsmatt I think in this administration we are finding lots of holes in the constitution. I don‚Äôt think a majority senate leader should be able to block bills or judges! &amp; A potus should be vetted by a committee &amp; show 10 years of taxes! Plus, There should be a psychological evaluation!

1320944487598755845 2020-10-27 12:24:42 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @markos Also, any Scotus should have at least 10 years experience as a judge.  That law should be passed &amp; make it retroactive!  So, which of the supreme court justices would have to step down?
1320943430009196545 2020-10-27 12:20:30 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @BFriedmanDC Brandon.  It seems to me that Trump was a test run for the many holes we have in the constitution. We need to mend them.  All presidential candidates should be well vetted by a committee and show 10 years of taxes.  A SCOTUS should have at least 10 years experience as a judge!

1320935745175994370 2020-10-27 11:49:58 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @DawnYatesArtist Could emails or other correspondence from Kavanaugh and or Barrett or both that shows political comments about Supporting trump‚Äôs causes be cause for them to be impeached?  In regards to Barrett, can her religious actions cause her to step down or be impeached?
1320914787073576964 2020-10-27 10:26:41 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @DoYouEvenLif Maybe there should be a law passed saying a supreme court judge must have at least 10 years experience as a judge before becoming a SCOTUS‚Äîmake it retroactive!  Barrett only had three years experience :0

1317507106413576193 2020-10-18 00:45:46 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @JonFlan @theresajlacey That‚Äôs too bad how people change to living a darker lifestyle. It sounds like Lindsey Graham chose a similar path.  Do you think there could be some deep dark secret on them?  Maybe they‚Äôre outwardly showing that they‚Äôre loyal to a source that holds their secrets?

1317504978529890305 2020-10-18 00:37:19 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @MerrittKelly1 @JonFlan I agree and look at all the CEOs of corporations that make over 1-10 million dollars a year or more. How much money do they need to be happy? I think power should be: giving a good chunk of it to charities, schools or programs! They should make a budget! ‚úàÔ∏è
1317501180763754496 2020-10-18 00:22:14 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @AuthorKimberley Apparently Rona &amp; her friends &amp; family make over $400,000 a year (at least 82% of them). Most would be happy to have that in their savings 4 a lifetime!  I guess that about 4% to 6% of the population in the US makes $400,000 a year? Most of my friends are Artists or teach=50-80K

That man next to her seemed to be the one that talked about the gun threats and he seem to control/own her.  I wish we could see his face to identify him but perhaps the woman could lead the FBI to him.

He kept interrupting &amp; talking over the woman like he owned her. So I would say the man is more guilty in terms of the FBI investigation than the woman for threats. But if recognized she could lead them to him.

On the other hand, I think Trump was flustered by the questions Savannh asked. Did you notice him perspiring? He only spoke for 1 hour/Biden spoke 90 min+
1317202480153849856 2020-10-17 04:35:18 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @scottbriggs0 @HeyTammyBruce He had what looked like a 3 x 5 card with some statistics on it ‚Äì ‚Äì numbers.

There‚Äôs another one ! Ouch! Taxes! Trump would‚Äôve done better with a debate against Biden on zoom!

1317196919534284800 2020-10-17 04:13:12 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @republiculos Right. And he never wrote a speech for Obama. He wrote speeches for President Bush though

Here‚Äôs the problem, once Amy Barrett becomes SCOTUS it is almost a fact that she will overturn Obamacare and we will all lose our pre-existing conditions. Trump will most likely lose the election &amp; this is coming up to be voted on November 10 ‚Äì hope you don‚Äôt get sick!
1316950458225856513 2020-10-16 11:53:51 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @edring Biden is not crooked but maybe people want to see what kind of trash is being tossed out there.  I thought social media (Twitter) was going to be tossing out the slanderous mis-information!
1316944276438323206 2020-10-16 11:29:17 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @MerileeParis Can we send these tweets over to the new social media platform called ‚ÄúParler‚Äù?  I heard a lot of the Trump supporters are heading over there because they get censored on Twitter.  Maybe I‚Äôm thinking more of the Qanon people?
1316942174706163716 2020-10-16 11:20:56 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @VABVOX I know what McConnell is up to. He knows Trump is losing and he wants to make Biden‚Äôs administration hell‚Äî I hope people realizes that it‚Äôs not Pelosi it‚Äôs the GOP. You need to call your Senators and complain‚Äî
1316938735456555008 2020-10-16 11:07:16 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @mmpadellan I‚Äôm going to be catching the Biden town hall on YouTube later tonight. I had plans during the debate and forgot to record it.  That‚Äôs good to know that Biden‚Äòs Townhall lasted longer. Can anyone tell me how much longer than DT‚Äôs?
1316936498546200579 2020-10-16 10:58:23 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @RepsForBiden I think it‚Äôs pretty lame that NBC aired a trump Townhall at the same time as Biden‚Äòs on ABC. I would‚Äôve like to have watched both.  Well people, go watch Biden on YouTube if you only had a chance to see Trump‚Äôs town hall and vice versa.
1316935888778264577 2020-10-16 10:55:58 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @RepsForBiden I think a lot of people are watching the Trump Townhall, not because they like him as a candidate but perhaps they want to see What off-the-wall comments he has to make and if he‚Äôs prepared. I guess people also want to see how much energy he has after having Covid19

I don‚Äôt mind hearing conservative views as long as there are news links to back them.  I really feel we need to unify instead of being so divided.
1316496529511735296 2020-10-15 05:50:06 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @mmpadellan Brooklyn dad, what I don‚Äôt understand is that genius politicians &amp; witty political philosophers begins a Twitter conversation &amp; conservatives come on and badmouth them w/o evidence. Seldom do I witness the opposite.  Do they think they‚Äôre going to sway moderates or the left?

He knows 6 or 7 languages right?  Can you imagine how the diplomats from other countries will do a 360¬∞ when they speak with such an intelligent man?  Maybe he will be our next secretary of state under Biden!
1316226999896010753 2020-10-14 11:59:05 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @krilia @PersonalAlchem @GeorgeTakei Sure, he‚Äôs young enough and he needs the experience before we vote for him as president.

Racism is all about how children are raised. It‚Äôs learned.

1314410465737359361 2020-10-09 11:40:50 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @jadeecee1 @gregolear Pelosi would be president for a while if Pence and Trump are incapacitated. So, she could put in her own supreme court justice if she‚Äôs president‚Äîjust saying.  But she would do the right thing and wait ‚Äì ‚Äì tell Barrett to step down and not replace her.

Did the president say lock her up-in regards to Whitmer today ‚Äì the day this terrorist plot against her was announced?  Could this be why Pelosi wants to talk about the 25th amendment next week?  Just curious about the time line.

1314292908170768384 2020-10-09 03:53:42 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @JoyceWhiteVance So why hasn‚Äôt the president or the WH said anything about this kidnapping plot? Are they all complacent on purpose? Why is Pelosi going to talk about the 25th amendment next week?  Is this somehow connected to the domestic terrorism plots?  Are there more plots in the works?
1314288646934028289 2020-10-09 03:36:46 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @TheDiscoUnicorn @thebradfordfile Dr. Fauci just said today in a press conference that next week will be the week that Trump experiences the worst of Covid19

I think Kamala Harris did a fantastic job last night. She was poised and patient when Pence consistently went over his time limit. And, Pence rarely answered the questions but skirted around them.

1314282950192590848 2020-10-09 03:14:08 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @ChampPR @dougducey You‚Äôre lucky to have been able to move to New Zealand. When I visited New Zealand four years ago you had to go via a return ticket. In order to be a citizen there you have to have $400,000 in the bank and make at least $60,000 a year.  Having a job offer there is just as good
1314281494446129152 2020-10-09 03:08:21 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @joelockhart I heard that the women‚Äôs vote with the undecided was up by about 14% from the debate last night!  Pence was condescending to the women-in interrupting, not finishing on time- going on and on, &amp; not answering many questions. Harris answered most that she could.
1314280368552341504 2020-10-09 03:03:52 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @coldlawgic @JudyB1313 The militia thugs were also going to destroy the police station nearby.

A spokesman said that they even had explosives to blow up a bridge. Not all the people were from MI &amp; at least one was from Del-Do they think DT will pardon them?

Unless you have $100,000 to burn for the cocktail the president got you better wear your mask because now it‚Äôs flu season. How will you know whether you have COVID-19 or the flu &amp; What if you catch the flu &amp; then Covid?
1314076170653069317 2020-10-08 13:32:28 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @chrislhayes The debate was very important because depending on who wins the election &amp; due to the age of the president the VP may possibly take over as president within the next 4 years.  So who would you trust the country to? Pence was very condescending to the women so he lost my vote!

1312621826464391168 2020-10-04 13:13:25 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @ballark @KnightLAT @rmayemsinger Does anyone have any evidence on when Amy Barrett had Covid? Remember summer Ended just a couple of weeks ago.  And, isn‚Äôt it true that you can get COVID-19 more than once?  I believe the antibodies don‚Äôt last that long

1312529715832348672 2020-10-04 07:07:24 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @HeidiEAnderson1 @CBSNews @WCCO Shouldn‚Äôt there be Repercussions if someone infects someone when they know they have a virus like COVID-19? It‚Äôs like when someone burns down their business for the insurance. They go to prison for 10 to 20 years for attempted murder of a Fireman!

I just read a couple of her tweets that condemns Biden for not standing up for himself. I thought he did great job considering Trump was like a 3-year-old saying mama mama mama La La la When mom is on the phone‚Äîinterrupting

1311196980480102401 2020-09-30 14:51:35 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @brhodes Well, I think people normally watching only Fox news was probably brainwashed into thinking Biden was mentally deficient so I‚Äôm glad they could see potus as he really is‚ÄîIn other words, he wasn‚Äôt the compassionate one

The debate team may bring it up for the next debate but I doubt if trump‚Äôs team will allow it.  The mic should‚Äôve been turned off for those who broke the rules and they should get forfeited 2 minutes
1311153942823280640 2020-09-30 12:00:34 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @alexatm101 @swilli8831 @ABC I agree with you! Biden was classy and yes he said a couple of comments that he needed to say but in general he was very compassionate and wanted to talk to we the people. I liked when he looked in the camera at us and stated his plans
1311152125678821377 2020-09-30 11:53:21 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @basma_harmouch @swilli8831 @ABC I thought Biden showed a lot of compassion that Trump lacked.  So, overall, I would say the undecided voters will vote for Biden unless they are white Supremists
1311150021891387394 2020-09-30 11:44:59 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @Breaking911 Well, overall I thought Biden showed compassion and Trump showed that he was sociopathic-like.  I feel that the undecided voters will most likely go to Biden unless they are white Supremists
1311136674923950080 2020-09-30 10:51:57 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @TG22110 If Chris Wallace said that I would‚Äôve taken back another comment I made about him :-)
1311135904233259009 2020-09-30 10:48:53 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> Trump abused the process!  That moderator, Chris Wallace was not respected.  He should've turned off trump's Mike for an extra two minutes. There's something he could've done!!!!!
1311129578350362625 2020-09-30 10:23:45 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @ananavarro Wallace is trying to save his job On Fox news?

1310641520895307782 2020-09-29 02:04:23 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @artoflivingslow As far as Facebook manipulation. Most of my followers are artists and are Democrats. I rarely ever see any political propaganda and if I do see politica instead of ‚Äúpolitico‚Äù for voting example I warn the person To be on the lookout for improper sources
1310640375694897152 2020-09-29 01:59:50 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @SusanMMeacham @Out5p0ken So someone needs to come up with another platform to replace Facebook if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre saying ‚Äì ‚Äì what about the old my space?
1310637465569382400 2020-09-29 01:48:16 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @alfonslopeztena When Biden becomes president I hope there‚Äôs a new law that requires all churches to pay income tax.  And if the middle-class Americans have no loopholes any longer in paying taxes then no one should!  How do you feel about getting A tax write off for contributing to charities?
1310614285408546816 2020-09-29 00:16:10 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @JoyAnnReid If Fox News hasn‚Äôt reported DT‚Äôs tax fraud story that The New York Times reported yesterday then it could backfire w the Fox people because they will probably watch the debate, &amp; will assume Biden will make a fool out of himself-NOT-Due to FOX‚Äôs claim Biden will be mentally weak

1310603822008475648 2020-09-28 23:34:35 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @jerrysaltz Well, hopefully the debate goes very well tomorrow night so that could take away some of the fears that DT wins the election.  And, I think Pelosi has more than 1 Weapon to stop the SCOTUS‚ÄîImpeach Barr!  BTW why do  some people claim DT is the greatest POTUS ever w/o examples?
1310601944608641030 2020-09-28 23:27:08 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @BrianRoemmele What is the medium for the figures? Is it ceramic? Wood? Or are actual humans shrink wrapped inside plastic as temporary performance art? The plastic is a creative way of suspending the figures but The wrinkles created from the process is distracting‚Äîfar reaching as art
1310600576367960065 2020-09-28 23:21:41 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @ReneeLasswell What I‚Äôm worried about is that DT is taking money from the coffers of various funds such as military, Social Security etc. and putting it in his pocket.

1309984180311261184 2020-09-27 06:32:21 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @kylegriffin1 OK. So we need to get the show on the road. Who are we going to impeach so we can stall the Senate?  I suspect we will find out on Monday. What do you think Kyle?

So many times in 2016 a news source on Facebook said something like politica instead of politico. Often the daily beast, etc is a source
1309916821777121280 2020-09-27 02:04:42 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @SaraGideon I love our government land as well/national lands. We can kiss them goodbye if Trump Tramples on the constitution because he‚Äôll sell off the land to corporations most likely to drill for oil, etc. The Grand Canyon &amp; Alaska are 2 areas that are on the top of that list!  #JoeBiden

1309912450653847554 2020-09-27 01:47:19 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @nytimes Proud Boys, etc R trying to make the protesters look bad!  I wish the protesters would go home &amp; be safe well before the curfew &amp; if these type of groups cause trouble by day maybe people need to take a break until after the election due to POTUS fueling the flames-40+ days

There needs to be some overhauling so people like trump don‚Äôt keep wasting money, Time and energy/limit appeals &amp; what constitutes ‚Äúfrivolous‚Äù?
1309572246680211456 2020-09-26 03:15:28 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @glennkirschner2 We‚Äôre waiting for those taxesüôèüèº. Please let us know when they‚Äôre finally released since Trump has no more chances in the courts to stop their release+Mary Trump is now suing Trump &amp; the siblings for millions. Could this indicate his taxes were released?/Interesting timing!

Do you want a majority of conservative Supreme Court justices To drop you from healthcare if you have pre-existing conditions. It will be coming up for a vote November 14th

Now he‚Äôs losing in the Senate race. I wonder what these GOP leaders know that we don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs like they know the election is in their pocket.

1309044358205919235 2020-09-24 16:17:50 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @underthesea62 @rayleengale I wonder where we could buy a CB radio? That would be the best fit if the Internet goes down.  I had an uncle that was a radio announcer during the war and always had a CB radio.  Or get people‚Äôs addresses and use snail mail.  NPR and Rachel Maddow for news

1309040289890394113 2020-09-24 16:01:40 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @HistoryGypsy @henryrodgersdc But why did the signs that I saw coming out of the U-Hauls say abolish the police?  Is that a bit radical?  Sure, Make it mandatory for officers to wear a cam, but don‚Äôt abolish all police.
1309039037869690882 2020-09-24 15:56:42 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @samajdarn @henryrodgersdc OK. you have a point but I saw some of the signs coming out of the U-Haul and they said things like abolish the police. The signs were very large and were not the typical protest signs for BLM.
1309037490213453831 2020-09-24 15:50:33 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @TheOxyCon @henryrodgersdc That‚Äôs true. Find out who was planning for an unruly protest due to the signs that I saw coming out of the U-Haul such as abolish police. And right, how did people know where to get those signs?

Let‚Äôs do something to make voting easier for people such as wear a mask and take someone in your neighborhood to the polling place

I live in AZ &amp; it‚Äôs a bit too hot for them here :-) although, a little secret is that Flagstaff is only 85¬∞ as a high in the summer &amp; the Grand Canyon, Payson, Prescott etc. has pines  https://t.co/hezZ6lHuHD
1308865324930998272 2020-09-24 04:26:25 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @wannachoco_ @DoxyMom2 @TexasTribune @SenTedCruz Why do you say the Democrats would make radical statements like Ted Cruz/act to benefit self vs others if the roles were reversed?  Most of my friends are Democrats and are either artists or teachers and make the world a better place for others!
1308859532228128775 2020-09-24 04:03:24 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @piedpenguin @ChadKMills @WDRBNews I agree with you on that but so many people have been hearing the word militia that I think it has a new terminology now. I found this:  https://t.co/VwfSSzoVo0Ôøº20/08/28/kyle-rittenhouse-violent-pro-trump-militias-police/
1308858085138722816 2020-09-24 03:57:39 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @cogitounboxed @ChadKMills @WDRBNews Yes, I hope someone gets in front of the militia &amp; get face shots of them just in case.  I wish AK-15‚Äôs are not allowed to be carried by civilians.  I certainly don‚Äôt feel safer as a matter fact I feel more fearful. Only swat teams &amp; the military should have those weapons!!!
1308856853628157953 2020-09-24 03:52:45 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @SVNewsAlerts Please Go home tonight all you wonderful protesters‚ÄîI feel you R being set up by the radicals. Uhauls have 100s of protest signs ready 2 go- very suspicious-and banners saying abolish the police. You don‚Äôt want all the police gone just the bad ones that don‚Äôt wear body cams!
1308855236279390208 2020-09-24 03:46:20 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @JoshuaPotash I think a sign saying abolish the police is going a bit too far don‚Äôt you (a radical plant?) One time a guy wearing orange knocked on my door at midnight-an escapee? Thankfully the police arrived quickly! I feel they need to wear police cams and if it is not on them‚Äîfire him/her
1308853997713973253 2020-09-24 03:41:25 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @HKrassenstein Yes! We need to spread this out there. Protesters R feeding into T‚Äôs hands. I believe in protesting Breanna but wait until after the election ‚Äì just another 45 days!  I‚Äôm not saying not to peacefully protest in the daytime but as soon as the sun goes down people need to go home
1308839255515504640 2020-09-24 02:42:50 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @GriffinMalone6 I‚Äôm glad the detective was indicted. He was the one that should have researched the correct address.  But I‚Äôm sorry, if those officers did not wear a body cam they should be guilty of at least manslaughter!
1308838810311102467 2020-09-24 02:41:04 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> There needs to be some new laws for police officers to protect themselves as well as society. If they do not wear a body cam for arrests‚Äìall types of arrests, they need to be suspended from duty/fired and that fact held against them for prosecution-most are good officers I feel

He followed families that were spies whereby their kids didn‚Äôt even know their parents were Russian. I think the series the ‚ÄúAmericans‚Äù was inspired by A KGB family in the US
1308123681764204546 2020-09-22 03:19:24 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @AvysDorinda @joelockhart Well, there is speculation that someone shut down the monetary Russia/Trump investigation of the Mueller report. Rosenstein ordered it but I don‚Äôt feel Mueller messed up. Who directed Rosenstein to stop it? I think Mueller was told he would be replaced if he investigated it.
1308122231042580480 2020-09-22 03:13:38 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @ericgarland Right. Didn‚Äôt Rosenstein shut down the monetary investigations between Trump and Russia? I don‚Äôt think Rosenstein did that on his own.  Who directed him to stop that part of the investigation?

1307870337921507328 2020-09-21 10:32:42 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @Davidsannie4 @ProjectLincoln @LittleBlkDres Yes, write the voting alert number on a sticky note and have it with you When you go to your polling place to vote.  If someone blocks your path to vote that is not allowed!  Perhaps have some friends meet you at the polling place at a given time.

Remember the House and Senate were run by the Republican so they may have found a way to stop filling her position 5 years ago! I believe there is a reason for everything.

I think the president is inciting violence so he can continue to call himself the one for law and order!  Maybe ID those people and see if they‚Äôre even from Portland.

He will most likely be in the Senate November 30 I‚Äôm I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll vote No!  He would not want a supreme court justice selected yet.

1307405630236311553 2020-09-20 03:46:07 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @lieann76996688 @Jbarkerjune @LindseyGrahamSC women will still get abortions with coat hangers-the poor ones. Other women will go to Mexico or Canada to have an abortion. Does a fetus feels pain-not wk 24 does it start to feel pain  https://t.co/gXN5t0dvjI

It‚Äôs a fact that a fetus does not begin to feel pain until the 24th week and most states have a law that says abortions cannot be done by that date unless the mother is at risk.  https://t.co/gXN5t0dvjI

1307401699036860417 2020-09-20 03:30:30 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @Jbarkerjune @LindseyGrahamSC Well you know the poor women will be the ones to use the coat hangers. Abortions will still happen but just not In a healthy way. The women who can afford it will get their abortions in Canada or Mexico.  What else will be reversed? Gay rights?
1307400495556820992 2020-09-20 03:25:43 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @KeithShow @LindseyGrahamSC 45 days is just a little over a month. We need to see what president is elected and then install a Scotus

I wonder how he will act if he knows a lot of people will change their minds &amp; vote for a Dem Senator in SC If he Goes against his previous word of not installing a SCOTUS in an election year? I‚Äôm from AZ and I‚Äôm voting for Mark Kelly!
1307398061983821824 2020-09-20 03:16:02 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @HKrassenstein @LindseyGrahamSC I think Lindsey Graham is going to lose this election because he lied to the people so what will he do for his own people in South Carolina in the future?  Lie to them? On the other hand if he sticks to his convictions he may just win the South Carolina Senate seat. Career or?

Do you think he would be thinking about serving the president or voting for the people‚ÄîNon-political? I‚Äôm thinking that perhaps he may be more non-political than people think
1307351156918689794 2020-09-20 00:09:39 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @shannonrwatts @ReverendWarnock I could be wrong but I‚Äôm pretty sure reversing women‚Äôs rights to protect their own body will mean that men will have wages garnished if they get a woman pregnant ‚Äì ‚Äì until that child is 18 years old because of DNA. BTW soon there will be incubators to raise a fetus=no abortions
1307338562891702273 2020-09-19 23:19:37 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @waltshaub Kavanaugh should not be tried for impeachment Until after the election. Hopefully there will be quite a few new dem senators in a majority but yes, there has to be more than a majority I believe to impeach a supreme court justice? Maybe look into his friends re sexual assault?
1307337041537986562 2020-09-19 23:13:34 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @Almijisti @JulieBorowski Well, I really admired justice Ginsburg and will be mourning her death for a while. So now I‚Äôm really concerned about our Constitution.  My biggest fear is if the president lies and says the election was rigged and asks the supreme court justices to vote him in-&amp; they do that
1307185146827649024 2020-09-19 13:09:59 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @JulieBorowski How could a law that was already passed by the Supreme Court be retried again?

1306721938723581957 2020-09-18 06:29:22 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @HopesMom12 @MerrittKelly1 @kylegriffin1 OK everyone. When you go to the post office to buy stamps or mail a package ask your postal clerk there if the sorting machines have been repaired. Let‚Äôs have a consensus. I will be going to the post office in the next couple of days so I will be asking or...#askyourmailcarrier
1306721125410287616 2020-09-18 06:26:08 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @bettygirl1239 @kylegriffin1 I wish the postal people could have stopped the sorting machines from being destroyed.  Surely everyone knew it was illegal to do that!
1306718882594344961 2020-09-18 06:17:13 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @FeasterFamine @kylegriffin1 And why not have DeJoy pay for the 600+ sorting machines to be reinstalled‚Äîwith his own money To lessen his prison sentence
1306718094560079872 2020-09-18 06:14:06 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @AriBerman I didn‚Äôt read the article but I hope that means DeJoy will reinstall the sorters and make the mail-in ballots first class; otherwise I suggest that everyone put a forever stamp on their mail-in ballot and make it first class‚ÄîJust in case.
1306716564188585985 2020-09-18 06:08:01 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @JBTonightShow @CRRJA5 There‚Äôs an interesting clause in there ‚Äì ‚Äì peacefully assemble. When people don‚Äôt wear a mask in stores for example when they‚Äôre supposed to &amp; cause a scene that‚Äôs not being peaceful. We are at war with a pandemic right now‚ÄîMasks saves lives‚Äîsinging in a church w/o a mask kills

Thankfully this wasn‚Äôt like the 1918 Spanish flu.  People bled internally. It could be worse:   https://t.co/wJkEKhvmhN
1306712159246663680 2020-09-18 05:50:30 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @JohnMax12665996 @CRRJA5 No way! As soon as my doctor And other doctors get the vaccine I‚Äôm ready to go. In the meantime I‚Äôm going to continue to wear a mask and wash my hands often. Most likely it will create a lesser flu season to wear a mask. That‚Äôs what happened in Melbourne Australia!
1306711488128675840 2020-09-18 05:47:50 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @yap2yap4yap1 @CRRJA5 @USAloveGOD Many people are &amp; were asymptomatic.  So there needed to be an initial lockdown and now people just need to self distance and wear a mask As well as limit the number of people in an area. Covid19 Can cause small and large blood vessels to burst causing strokes &amp; harming organs!
1306710086228738048 2020-09-18 05:42:16 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @myown1959 @CRRJA5 No. The government won‚Äôt be mandating country to get the vaccine‚Äîthere can be a certain percentage of the population that doesn‚Äôt get the vaccine and it would still Cause the virus to diminish or die out
1306709580794060800 2020-09-18 05:40:16 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @paulsperry_ Yes! Those radical groups need to be investigated. AG should start with proud boys and Boogaloo. I heard they were we‚Äôre driving into the protest areas from out of town and rioting as well as looting after curfew hours!  https://t.co/3aOFcFqI4y

Does he think the elderly are expendable‚ÄîHave Herd immunity Because it‚Äôll kill off the elderly, blacks and Hispanics?
1306706695633002496 2020-09-18 05:28:48 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @DoxyMom2 @az_reason @paulkrugman Are you saying that if you go to work outside of your home you would not want to wear a mask? Yikes! Today they said in Melbourne Australia that the flu season was very small because people are still wearing masks and washing their hands frequently-A thought for flu season
1306705694641381376 2020-09-18 05:24:49 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @mbradle3 @paulkrugman SNL!
1306704944238489600 2020-09-18 05:21:50 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @MartaWomack @paulkrugman I heard today that Melbourne Australia had a very small flu season because people are still wearing masks and washing their hands frequently. Remember it is winter there when it is summer here
1306704554134659072 2020-09-18 05:20:17 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @MikeHolloway @paulkrugman Good point but we do pay for trash pick up in our water bill
1306690481007374336 2020-09-18 04:24:22 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @cards2020champs @RexChapman Also, today on the news someone from Melbourne Australia said that their flu season was very small because people were wearing a mask and washing their hands frequently. It might not be a bad idea for us to continue to do that during flu season.  Even after COVID-19 is gone

1306473410172604423 2020-09-17 14:01:48 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @CastilleJordi @mmpadellan So true! Arpiao even had a women‚Äôs chain gang. And one time he even had cams in women‚Äôs sleeping quarters but he quickly took that down.  Another very racist Arizona politician was governor Mecham:  https://t.co/9BsZXH7So1

1306425531970142209 2020-09-17 10:51:33 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @travisakers Do you think maybe Pence says he has the virus and then he could be in isolation so he doesn‚Äôt have to have a debate against Kamala Harris October 7?

1306420074941562880 2020-09-17 10:29:52 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @duty2warn Well, so far many people not wearing a mask in public are Republicans at those POTUS rallies  https://t.co/KAah9vW81S

1306391659958083584 2020-09-17 08:36:57 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @Fishbones2017 Thank you for saying moderate Democrat and not socialist
1306390548731707393 2020-09-17 08:32:33 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @CastilleJordi @mmpadellan There is hardly any humidity in Arizona until the monsoon season season hits‚Äî this year we didn‚Äôt really have much of one.  It hasn‚Äôt rained much in Phoenix for about 120 days but it has rained a lot up in the mountains
1306343110813728768 2020-09-17 05:24:02 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @RosiePunch @RexChapman Well, their faces are public and the assault was shown as a record. They need to be reprimanded for not wearing a mask, and verbally and physically assaulting someone.  Whoever took that video, was the police called?
1306342564165857280 2020-09-17 05:21:52 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @cards2020champs @RexChapman Say, I don‚Äôt like wearing a seatbelt but I do. There‚Äôs that one chance in 1 million I could get into major accident. What if you‚Äôre the one that gets COVID-19 because someone else doesn‚Äôt wear a mask? Thank you for going along with the mask wearing even though you don‚Äôt like it
1306298677888081920 2020-09-17 02:27:29 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @CastilleJordi @mmpadellan That sounds like a great plan except for the cutting off the AC.  It would probably take hours and hours before the store would get warm enough to make it uncomfortable in there
1306298390657953792 2020-09-17 02:26:20 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @IJS03422635 @mmpadellan Good point! I believe you are correct! What Trump doesn‚Äôt realize is that many more people contracted it and died at home and haven‚Äôt been recorded via a hospital.
1306297776477581312 2020-09-17 02:23:54 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @ForFoxSake84 @mmpadellan Yes, and now all of their faces ‚Äì ‚Äì the non-mask wears flaunting the fact at Target ‚Äì ‚Äì yelling and spewing droplets all over the place, now went public!  They better hope they don‚Äôt come down with COVID-19 and spread it or they may be sued. I wonder who they are
1306296720628707329 2020-09-17 02:19:42 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @BaumanDe @mmpadellan Good point!!!
1306296507369320448 2020-09-17 02:18:51 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @gary_kline @mmpadellan Well, all the faces have been recorded and went public/not wearing a mask in Target. Target, Costco, &amp; most stores require a mask just like you need to wear a seatbelt or you can be fined!  If any of those people come down with COVID-19 &amp; is a carrier I hope they are prosecuted!

I think if teachers go back to school and teach in person they should be provided with hazmat suits including shields that connect to the suit. If I had that, I would teach again. And, get one of those canisters that kill the virus before you take the suit off daily
1306293874785099777 2020-09-17 02:08:24 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @KaizokuShojo @SMWillox @mmpadellan I heard that it takes at least three months to recuperate from COVID-19. After that some are still compromised. The virus is nasty! It can cause small and large blood vessels to burst creating strokes and damages organs permanently!
1306293361649709056 2020-09-17 02:06:21 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @SMWillox @mmpadellan I live in Arizona and the Navajo reservation got hit hard by Covid19!  People in neighborhoods are putting together supplies and taking it down there.  Come on Trump supporters, please wear a mask to protect others.  https://t.co/devvjhRFUg
1306291031772520448 2020-09-17 01:57:06 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @JNBoylan @mmpadellan Well the people that are destroying property and rioting are the ones who are called proud boys and Boogaloo. The vandalism starts after curfew hours! Look it up.  Target mandates wearing a mask and these people are breaking the law and potentially possibly spreading Covid
1306290025470914561 2020-09-17 01:53:06 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @KatrinaHagen2 Good luck! My friend Tina started law school at about 39 years old.  She became a corporate lawyer!  And, she‚Äôs a Democrat! I have three friends that are lawyers and all are Democrats. Yay!
1306261330010103808 2020-09-16 23:59:04 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @5_2blue It looks like there is a such thing as karma. And all those people who go to the rallies without masks yelling and screaming while all the droplets of COVID-19 Spread to many‚Äîmore karma.
1306260326170599426 2020-09-16 23:55:05 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @KatrinaHagen2 Congratulations! Age is just a number. You set a goal and you are accomplishing it And learning much along the way! Heck, you could live to be well over 100!  Keep going!
1306259132609998848 2020-09-16 23:50:20 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @peterbakernyt Here is the trailer to World on Fire. It‚Äôs a PBS series and I believe it can be watched on Amazon prime. Season 1 just finished a few months ago and there will be more seasons. It‚Äôs an excellent movie about how the Nazis persecuted Europe:  https://t.co/JnNcSHrr1f
1306258099490099202 2020-09-16 23:46:14 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @peterbakernyt Here is more information about the most famous German female artist, Kathe Kollwitz.  She is indeed one of my favorite artists. Her late works were created during the Nazi era:  https://t.co/6tUlFpJqJu
1306257345580736512 2020-09-16 23:43:14 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @peterbakernyt In July 1936, the Gestapo threatened Kathe Kollwitz with arrest &amp; deportation to a Nazi concentration camp; she/husband resolved to commit suicide if such a prospect became inevitable. However, Kollwitz was by now a figure of international note, &amp; no further action was taken.
1306256487161847808 2020-09-16 23:39:50 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @peterbakernyt Why isn‚Äôt the holocaust being taught in schools? I learned about the holocaust in art history classes when we talked about Kathe Kollwitz, The most famous woman artist that lived in Germany.  She was threatened by the Nazis-forced to portray her art the way they wanted it...

Climate change will continue to move across the country.  There are some areas in Arizona that are pretty cool in the summer with no earthquakes or hurricanes
1306174376048386048 2020-09-16 18:13:33 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @megmeg381 @RexChapman It‚Äôs the proud boys &amp; Boogaloo that caused all the problems after curfew hours.  They drive in from out of town. They‚Äôre the ones that caused the destruction‚ÄîLooting &amp; vandalism to make it look like it was the protesters. Our cities are as safe as they ever were

1306171966101966849 2020-09-16 18:03:58 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @QuancyClayborne @RexChapman But yes there are some Kens and Karens not wearing masks and making a scene. I am so thankful that most stores mandate wearing a mask.  Stores are some of the few places I go to any more‚Äî Thank goodness so far I haven‚Äôt seen anyone not wearing a mask at the grocery stores
1306170738613784577 2020-09-16 17:59:06 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @QuancyClayborne @RexChapman Maybe we should play a game where we pretend no one has skin color.

1306078980773048320 2020-09-16 11:54:29 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @JackPosobiec Come on everyone, maybe Biden really does like the music.  1 of my favorite singers is Shakira. Look at the policies. Do you want freedom or do you want a dictator? Do you want clean air for your kids? Florida will be underwater in about 20 years. Biden believes in science

1306059742763130881 2020-09-16 10:38:02 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @KamalaHarris I live in AZ &amp; taught art in the public schools! I always loved Hispanic students. They are so creative!  Some little kindergarteners or first graders  couldn‚Äôt speak English on the 1st wk of school &amp; were scared so I would talk to them in Spanish and hand them a stuffed animal

He will give you real Hurricane based relief ‚Äì ‚Äì monetary relief and probably help out physically in person!  He Is that kind of man!!!

It‚Äôs Florida that apparently has the Cuban vote which is Rep because they are afraid of socialism?‚Äîmaybe it reminds them of communism? Biden is not a socialist But will make your life better than Trump. B believes in science

1304157175133077504 2020-09-11 04:37:55 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @kat_smalltalk @Shem_Infinite Now there are 190,000 dead &amp; over 6 million people who have had it or have it (millions more= asymptomatic). We don‚Äôt know what side effects are held by the disease. For example, is it like chickenpox where it could come back later?-chickenpox can become shingles.

I wish you just put in a paper ballot and the machine counts the ballot as it enters. In Arizona we don‚Äôt have ballots with chads.  You use a black marker and mark the selections

1303791026008543232 2020-09-10 04:22:58 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @DrDenaGrayson The AGs of each state needs to check out the software of the voting machines. Why are we using computerized voting machines anyway? You put in a paper ballot &amp; it clicks a number? In Arizona we have a black marker and we mark selections in ink/no hanging chads &amp; = a paper trail

Do you think POTUS dishing the military, lying about the virus &amp; inspiring Proud Boys to visit various cities to cause trouble at BLM protests is enough to give Biden Harris a lift? Now he talks about a secret nuclear system-? Taxes??

1303777530042658816 2020-09-10 03:29:20 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @bluenaredstate @danielsgoldman I was reading a Republican based thread about the Woodward scenario and they‚Äôre calling it a hoax but I don‚Äôt think they are realize there are actual visual tapes Incriminating the president. I wonder if those could be shown on the Fox News Twitter feed, maybe under Hannity?

The mask prevents the other person from catching the airborne disease and in turn others wearing mask protects you! I saw A man not wearing a mask at Lowe‚Äôs yesterday and was appalled.  Thankfully I was about 15 ft away!

Let us  on Twitter know what was said!  Good luck over there! I‚Äôm in Arizona and we have a ballot you can use markers to fill it in so there is still a paper trail
1303705083796811778 2020-09-09 22:41:28 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @BeautyBind I certainly hope so!  Something sounds awfully fishy about Biden‚Äôs polls in Fla dropping as much as nine points in less than a week. When is Biden and Harris heading to Florida?
1303690811205246978 2020-09-09 21:44:45 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @mmpadellan @wechoosewisdom What do we do? We need to get the Biden Harris polls cranked up in Florida. I just made a plea to Ana Navarro.  She could be a big help.  I thought Biden was ahead by at least 9 points in Florida. What happened?
1303690220919902208 2020-09-09 21:42:24 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @BeautyBind BTW I saw that Susan Sarandon is trending. She‚Äôs pushing a third-party candidate. I made a comment about it on her thread and already received a response By someone else voting third-party. All I ask is why? I did give a good explanation as to why now is not the time.
1303689565467631616 2020-09-09 21:39:48 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @klmccook @HKrassenstein By the way, I‚Äôm an independent so I am a vote third-party eventually when this is all over. I really like Andrew Yang for example right now I am so fearful that our constitution is being shredded.  All that died for the constitution is what I would be thinking about.
1303689032514248704 2020-09-09 21:37:41 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @klmccook @HKrassenstein Please don‚Äôt vote for 3rd party this time around. Trump will win if too many vote third-party and then you‚Äôll have a dictator in office. Look what‚Äôs happening with DeJoy, Hatch act, military disrespectful, Barr and that rape victim/Unprecedented‚Äîüôèüèº vote blue, etc.!
1303686375938514947 2020-09-09 21:27:08 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @HKrassenstein I wish Susan Sarandon would stick to acting if she‚Äôs going to be pushing a third-party candidate. We need to come together right now/vote blue &amp; maybe in 4-8 years we can go that route but not now. Biden said he would push for electric cars and green energy that‚Äôs a great start!
1303678516668497920 2020-09-09 20:55:54 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @ananavarro @MichaelCohen212 Ana, what can you/we do to convince the Cuban Americans in Florida that Trump is not a good choice? Maybe convincing them Trump is pro-choice is a start?  I couldn‚Äôt believe the polls yesterday that Trump and Biden are even-48% to 48%!  BTW I miss you on the View Fridays!
1303541670802149376 2020-09-09 11:52:07 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @RexResearcher I think some things cannot be divulged by Cohen‚Äîthat could incriminate him
1303235111299686401 2020-09-08 15:33:58 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @KeyDecision1 @JayThePopulist Sometimes parents are taken to court when their kids miss 30+ days of school. Some parents make the older kids, say the 10-16 yr olds, stay home and take care of their younger siblings.  I don‚Äôt know of any that actually served time for it But it‚Äôs really not fair to the kids

It does take a lot of water to feed cattle too. I do hope climate change doesn‚Äôt destroy the farming industry soon
1303176512208662528 2020-09-08 11:41:07 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @CaroleMyers @DaniellaMicaela Yep. I hate to say it but because of

There needs to be curfews &amp; anyone outside &amp; in the protest areas after 8pm should be arrested.

1302366465757044741 2020-09-06 06:02:16 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @AceHoffman It‚Äôs not a bad idea to kick out the students who come down with Covid19  at colleges If it was discovered they were going to house parties or caught not wearing a mask in public!  Maybe they would think twice before being so careless if it‚Äôs their future
1302365334079381504 2020-09-06 05:57:47 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @neiltyson That‚Äôs pretty funny because if an alien was able to travel light years to earth they most definitely believe in science.

1302359813091860480 2020-09-06 05:35:50 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @chrisgalea @KellyO @NBCNews There really needs to be a new law that states that a president can only travel for recreation a certain amount of times a year ‚Äì ‚Äì certainly there should be a golf course within driving distance of DC ‚Äì ‚Äì somewhere near DC!  AfterX amount of recreation days, the POTUS must pay!

He had some great come-backs... there‚Äôs inside the WH talk of military disrespect behind closed doors as well. And Others went to the cemetery in France in spite of the weather including John Kelly

The primary in AZ was in April. I received an application for a mail-in ballot, filled it out &amp; drove it over to the polling place. I still received an application for the Nov election!

1302033254153728000 2020-09-05 07:58:13 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @PeteButtigieg I watched mayor Pete on Fox News &amp; I was thankful that Fox News aired him &amp; 20+ secs. of Biden. Right afterwards the news announcer started downplaying Biden‚Äôs lack of anger &amp; talking about how Fla‚Äôs ‚ù§Ô∏è T for violence control &amp; the economy &amp; implied FLa polls 4 T=good. Violence?
1302026141729869825 2020-09-05 07:29:57 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @Strandjunker After that remark about the women such as Fiona Hill, Sally Yates, etc speaking up, we may hear from from the generals! They really need to stand up for the military!  &amp; Tammy Duckworth today said when her plane was shot down she was 1st thought to be dead #shesnoloser
1302023826369212417 2020-09-05 07:20:45 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @joshscampbell @JeffreyGoldberg Biden was very angry in today‚Äôs speech-I heard more of his speech about the military &amp; how T calls them losers. &amp; Biden was in WI yesterday  https://t.co/SRCccQes1L

This may be the nail in the coffin ‚Äì making such terrible-horrifying, remarks about the military!  I heard Tammy Duckworth talk about how she was at 1st thought to be dead when her plane was shot down
1302018178499796993 2020-09-05 06:58:18 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @joshscampbell @JeffreyGoldberg Say everyone, mayor Pete is going to be on Fox news at 7 PM ET talking about the military

1302013575263789056 2020-09-05 06:40:01 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @ericswalwell Gosh! It almost looks like his degrading of the military is 1 more item on a list that he is supposed to check off by I won‚Äôt say what country.  What‚Äôs next-stepping down from NATO?  His disparaging the military is due to a lack of empathy-&amp; he‚Äôs abolishing Stars &amp; Stripes news
1301998096877060098 2020-09-05 05:38:30 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @HKrassenstein This may be the nail in the coffin for the most patriotic of the POTUS base to support him now that there‚Äôs so much evidence he thinks of the wounded or fallen soldiers as losers.  He said-what‚Äôs in it for them-they probably don‚Äôt make enough $ 2 be respected by him. $matters!

1301722320499695616 2020-09-04 11:22:40 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @suecorvette @KDKA Well, we had A pandemic, killer hornets, earthquake near the San Andreas Fault, Hurricane Laura-The strongest hurricane to have ever hit Louisiana, protesters arrested &amp; placed in unmarked SUVs and kids in cages. God may be sending us a message here: #VoteBidenHarris2020
1301716087709417473 2020-09-04 10:57:54 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @mcgrathmickj @mmpadellan The Dow is down 807 points today and apparently Apple stock lost $187 billion today. The NASDAQ is down over 500 points.  I wonder if Stock market is now catching up with all the job losses.
1301686092010192896 2020-09-04 08:58:43 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @mikehahn_ @realDonaldTrump OMG I used to visit Latrobe often to visit my aunt &amp; uncle. It was farm country- at the time I was a kid my cousins would shuck corn, dry it out and then toss it at windows during Halloween‚Äî an innocent prank that the neighbors expected.

1301666985340620801 2020-09-04 07:42:47 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @davidmweissman @kylegriffin1 I‚Äôve been thinking that this is strike 3+ for the president in regards to the military-in disrespecting a gold star father/wife, pardoning a soldier that urinated on deceased,etc, abandoned the Kurds to be most probably killed, Russian bounties, etc-now this-and much more!

1301652806982537217 2020-09-04 06:46:27 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @kylegriffin1 Wow! The president certainly is alienating the military.  If he loses the election and claims the election was rigged and refuses to leave the White House do you think the military will Help him pack up his stuff and move him out?
1301651798130741248 2020-09-04 06:42:26 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @lauferlaw I had to look up those initials ‚Äì ‚Äì Russian organizations.  Snowden, in order to have safety there, must have traded quite a bit of classified information

1301281660806209536 2020-09-03 06:11:39 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @ananavarro @SpeakerPelosi So what‚Äôs the difference if a hairstylist goes to your house to give you a haircut or style your hair versus closing down the salon to the public and only allowing one person at a time For the haircut etc.
1301258171520962561 2020-09-03 04:38:18 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @realDonaldTrump The stock market does not look at politics. The Stock market is about the companies not the president.  I think the stock market sees that there is a vaccine around the corner and there‚Äôs hope but that‚Äôs not‚Äî politics!

1301244133210611712 2020-09-03 03:42:31 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @kdevil66 @mdnij34 They were helping Trump‚Äôs cause. The 17-year-old was in the first row of a Trump rally. It was televised and the photo of him there was shown on Twitter.  Also, Zuckerberg took down a page on Facebook requesting militia such as proud boys to head toward the protests.
1301243188737241088 2020-09-03 03:38:46 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @JasonMillerinDC Nope! Biden would raise taxes on the 18% who make over $400,000 a year

Or, have people turn in their A.R. 15‚Äòs and have them redesigned to do that
1301178985267605506 2020-09-02 23:23:39 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @mmpadellan What I don‚Äôt understand is how the Ingram interview debacle on Fox incl Biden Sending men wearing black clothes to Portland, doesn‚Äôt increase Biden‚Äôs chances to win the election by at least 15 points! How could the race  be so close when so many Republicans R now voting4Biden?
1301176380638392320 2020-09-02 23:13:18 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @whitestwhitekid @LadyGravemaster @dorkoramadesign @TrumpStudents @realDonaldTrump Great idea!

However, I do hope someday the AR15‚Äôs with multiple round magazines as well as pistols with multiple round magazines becomes banned from those other than the military. Besides, hunting with those will tear up the meat!

Biden already said he‚Äôs going to keep the Obamacare.  This country needs to heal &amp; the constitution needs to be saved. In healing, we need a strong EPA For clean air, etc.

In Phoenix we have a station called KJZZ &amp; NPR is proadcasted daily on it until about 8 PM and then we listen to jazz
1300937128495337474 2020-09-02 07:22:36 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @jacobhinz4 Biden &amp; Harris are not socialists.  There‚Äôs a certain amount of socialism in this country as it is: the police dept. highways, public schools, etc.  He wants Obamacare-not Medicare 4 all. Go online &amp; look at his policies.  Wait! I‚Äôll look it up for you:   https://t.co/jQqR8tUykp
1300819247707250689 2020-09-01 23:34:11 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @HerelnTheDark NPR is one of the least biased stations!

I don‚Äôt listen to music in the car and told them that. I like to listen to the news stations.  I would rather pay that extra $45 to NPR!

1300698846876450816 2020-09-01 15:35:45 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @jerrysaltz Was POTUS referring to the men in black? I always wanted to know what the CIA found in reference to alien visitations  https://t.co/1KbtTT6Yqg

1300625596939079681 2020-09-01 10:44:41 +0800 <DeborahHodder1> @kirkacevedo I would walk through the Phoenix 117¬∞ heat to vote for Biden (well, it could still be over 100¬∞ October 7th, the first day of voting early here)

Did Mueller think the FBI was investigating it?  Go to it FBI!  Adam Schiff is going after Deutsche Bank...
