Whatever the CDC advises, he does the opposite. Whatever Trump says, he follows. Please investigate &amp; report as u have on other governors.

1312526018687639552 2020-10-04 06:52:43 +0800 <cybernutty> @chrislhayes I feel nothing for Trump.

1312452816829521921 2020-10-04 02:01:50 +0800 <cybernutty> Yes, if he recovers miraculously, COVID is not serious. He tweeted a short time ago and sounds perfectly healthy, however, they say he has trouble breathing. Which is it?

1312443501729071106 2020-10-04 01:24:49 +0800 <cybernutty> @AnnaForFlorida I mailed my ballot at the beginning of the past week. It was mail, received, and COUNTED in a week. #VoteEarly
1312442882666577921 2020-10-04 01:22:21 +0800 <cybernutty> @travisakers About time!!
1312442298123206658 2020-10-04 01:20:02 +0800 <cybernutty> He IS a better person &amp; doesn’t need 2 prove himself. @JoeBiden stopped them on the day it was announced #45 had COVID. Now it’s time to resume his campaign. Good and negative ads. Everything about Trump’s diagnosis is being questioned now. Gooooo Joe!!
1312440386103635968 2020-10-04 01:12:26 +0800 <cybernutty> @KamalaHarris The Trump campaign neglected to let @JoeBiden know #45 had COVID. This is a WH ploy to cover up Trump was infected 72 hrs prior to letting people know. He intentionally held rallies. Republicans are testing positive now. PLEASE return all campaign ads to TV!
1312138806322106369 2020-10-03 05:14:04 +0800 <cybernutty> @JoyAnnReid My thoughts exactly! Don’t believe him.

1312137451666718721 2020-10-03 05:08:41 +0800 <cybernutty> @joncoopertweets @JoeBiden It’s disgusting! He’s received an antibody cocktail for a moderate case of COVID. Anyone else suffering from COVID across the US receive it? Give him his hydrochloroquine &amp; bleach injection. He says it works. WH workers STILL not wearing masks. SMH

1311504504660070400 2020-10-01 11:13:35 +0800 <cybernutty> @Acosta Trump just can’t stop lying!! When Biden’s camp says that, I’ll believe it!!

Joe Biden is not senile &amp; your Trump wouldn’t know the truth if it hit him in the head. He paid a smart man 2 take his SATs &amp; his sister did his college HW. The IQ test he took awhile ago was ridiculous &amp; provided lots of laughs.
1311427563324088320 2020-10-01 06:07:50 +0800 <cybernutty> @Liverpoolfc46 @TheDailyShow Trump says they don’t sweep the floor or get the little sticks of tinder that’s there. 🤷🏻‍♀️

1311425145806954497 2020-10-01 05:58:14 +0800 <cybernutty> @GeorgeTakei It was disgraceful! Biden tried so hard to ignore Trump’s constant interruptions, but it took a toll on him, not bc of age. Hell, I’m younger and my head was spinning.  Trump mistook his stuttering for lack of ability. Trump was responsible 4 the chaos.
1311423200509730819 2020-10-01 05:50:30 +0800 <cybernutty> @realDonaldTrump I don’t believe ur unfamiliar with Proud Boys bc when ur called on the carpet 4 something, that’s ur answer-I don’t know or never met them. U can’t denounce white supremacy bc ur a racist like ur dad, &amp; u are a chip off his shoulder. Apple doesn’t fall far.
1311422118912028673 2020-10-01 05:46:12 +0800 <cybernutty> @realDonaldTrump Joe Biden can do rings around you in the IQ area. U tend to misread his stuttering for incompetence. U have no tolerance for disabilities. Guess he took his own SATs and did his college assignments where u have always needed help. Joe is smarter &amp; on the ball!

1311144271429369856 2020-09-30 11:22:08 +0800 <cybernutty> Shut Trump’s mike OFF when his time is up and remove minutes from his responses every time he disobeys debate rules.

Would he be able to handle Trump’s yelling &amp; interrupting him when asked questions? Biden handled himself professionally and tried to let viewers know his plans &amp; comments. Chris Wallace couldn’t handle Trump. BidenWonTheDebate

Our country does NOT recognize illnesses that occurred from horrific events. Vietnam Veterans have been rejected now for over 50 years. See the pattern? Sooo sad.

I don’t give a damn about his health. What about the hundreds of thousands of Americans that have died from COVID that could have been avoided if you told us early when you knew it was serious!

With Trump’s record on lying, I believe Woodward the complete info on Trump’s admissions about COVID before bringing it to the public’s attention. Even if he released that info then, Trump would manipulate the info to his liking just like he’s doing now.
