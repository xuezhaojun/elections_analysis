Brexit Party and UKIP stood down most of their 2019 candidates in Conservative seats to get Brexit done.  We helped Boris get his 80 seat majority.  We now disagree with their lockdown policy.  And with mass immigration

1325808664876298241 2020-11-09 22:33:12 +0800 <DavidHadley1973> @JWPReardon UKIP stood down their candidates and told their members to vote for Boris.  BECAUSE UKIP WANTS TO GET BREXIT DONE.  But we have become tired of mass immigration  and all these lockdowns.  Nevertheless our priority is still to get Brexit done.

The system of food vouchers should be extended to cover the half term holiday and Christmas.  In the short term this is a reasonably cheap solution to the Covid-19 hunger crisis.

But if one infected person enters Britain everything starts all over again.  So it would only be a short term gain.  Following Sweden seems to be a middle path.  We flatten the curve a bit.

They realise that UKIP was right all along. The whole country now realises what a big mistake it was to drop immigration as an issue.  That is why UKIP is rising again

But Nigel Farage now realises that dropping the immigration issue was a big mistake.  He has returned to his roots.  He now supports the UKIP viewpoint on immigration.  Its big news again.

So he set up the Brexit Party.  He topped the poll with the Brexit Party.  He now realises that was a mistake.  He is now the main person in Britain against illegal immigration

In the USA babies get a vast number of vaccination for many sicknesses that have almost died out.  We think there are too many vaccination for babies.

And on the world stage Donald Trump takes the lead.  For the next month UKIPers should be campaigning for Donald Trump and the USA Republican Party on Twitter.  Every little helps.

The Brexit Party is the big Brother.  We could never beat Nigel Farage in a fight.  But we still feel we have a role to play.  Even if it is a smaller supporting role.

You dont like UKIP.  I wont try to change your mind.

Patriots are all on the same side.

Not to change parties but just cooperate with each other.  For example all patriots want to halt illegal immigration.  Surely that is a campaign we could all work on.

She was supported by Red Robbo of the Labour Party who was determined to bankrupt Leyland Cars by striking.  So during the 1970s British industry had no friends, left or right.  So Britain stopped making things

Rover Cars asked Tony Blair for help but it was refused because it was classed as state aid and was illegal under EU law.  That is why we have to import so much.

1306689396612227073 2020-09-18 04:20:03 +0800 <DavidHadley1973> @LucBarrett3 @UKIP @NeilUKIP UKIP supports British industry. It is called state aid.  That is banned in the EU.  But this is Britain, UKIP wants to support British companies in preference to foreign companies.  That is what being a patriot means.
1306688524226306054 2020-09-18 04:16:35 +0800 <DavidHadley1973> @LucBarrett3 @UKIP @NeilUKIP In a recession we would support British industry.  Illegal in the EU but we are leaving, so it OK.  1/ That could mean loans to businesses.  2/ It could mean a buy British policy.  3/ Government spends 700 billion a year UKIP would guide much of that spending to British companies
1306687374164979713 2020-09-18 04:12:01 +0800 <DavidHadley1973> @LucBarrett3 @UKIP @NeilUKIP Britain runs a trade deficit with the EU of 2 billion pounds a week.  The trade deficit is approximately a hundred billion every year.  We are being robbed.  UKIP supports British industry.  But supporting your own industry is illegal in the EU.

That could be why you feel that helping them is racist.  But a patriot loves his country and wants it to prosper as a nation and economically.  That includes helping the young
1306683105957285888 2020-09-18 03:55:04 +0800 <DavidHadley1973> @LucBarrett3 @UKIP @NeilUKIP Luc,  You probably think that helping the young generation to find a home for their families is racist.  But this is Britain, we pay our taxes, we want to help the young generation to make a good start in life.  British homes for British homeless.

House prices are far too high.  The young cant afford to rent or buy.  UKIP is the only party that cares about young people.  We want a decent home and job for all. We want to help young people

I am sure that everyone in the Labour Party would claim to be a patriot.  The word patriot is a very weak word.  It includes almost everyone.  Even socialists and Marxists.

I would say they were civic nationalists.  This means they cannot be trusted on issues like immigration.  They are also brainwashed about Globalisation.

I frightens off the liberals and Marxists.  Nationalism is a political philosophy.  It clarifies the issues.  For example all nationalists hate HS2.

I swap around the words nationalist, patriot and centre right because they all mean roughly the same thing.  Patriotism is a very weak word.  For example Theresa May said she was a patriot.  Most liberals and Communists call themselves patriots.
