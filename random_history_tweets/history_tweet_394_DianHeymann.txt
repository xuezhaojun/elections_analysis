When Trump fires they revolt.Trump is evil and satanic to dare institute Marshall law. This sickening thinking is floating around. Trump has brainwashed his base and enablers.Putin can do that in Russia but can't export to America as annex
1340989606150418432 2020-12-21 19:56:51 +0800 <DianHeymann> @LepapillonBlu @cljmo Bolton part of fascists team until Trump fired you? Whilst with him you were a right wing hardliner pushing for war. What has changed? After writing a book about the time at the WH,as a senior citizen what good did you  bring America Seeds of discord maturing into Marshall law
1340970954785251329 2020-12-21 18:42:44 +0800 <DianHeymann> @RepClayHiggins That's very true and the wish of millions of Americans.
1340374079799504902 2020-12-20 03:10:58 +0800 <DianHeymann> @WalshFreedom Shamefully shameful and disgraceful for Trump to defence of Russia

1340371525275414528 2020-12-20 03:00:49 +0800 <DianHeymann> @itsJeffTiedrich The greatest mistake America has made is for Trump to be President.
1340035490704187395 2020-12-19 04:45:32 +0800 <DianHeymann> @TimOBrien TRUMP WHERE ARE YOU? HAPPY WITH PUTIN AS HE  ATTACKS THE NATION

1340035485759115267 2020-12-19 04:45:31 +0800 <DianHeymann> @TimOBrien What is happening asTrump  sends dangerous worrying threats to survival of democracy in America. A puppet of Kremlin sabotaging all efforts to  normalcy. America is under attack. Chris Miller and pentagon are refusing to cooperate with Biden team so they will be kept in the dark
1339974596041322497 2020-12-19 00:43:33 +0800 <DianHeymann> @MedicVet68 @Betterw05759703 The irony is that the very president entrusted with protection of the nation is the main antagonist secretly giving her away. What is more problematic is his inability to seek some form of respite to the cyberwarfare  by Russia on America.
1339951743346610179 2020-12-18 23:12:45 +0800 <DianHeymann> @RoArquette @LynnSharig8 Trump, GOP, his enables are compli it. They have given him the backing to and energized Trump base to protest across the country. They followed Trump to Moscow and remain supportive of his criminal moves.. Money has  been the biggest factor and fear of losing support base
1339944026280243201 2020-12-18 22:42:05 +0800 <DianHeymann> @robreiner I'm not a lawyer but. my little under derstanding tells me that Trump has to be charged and tried for treason and espionage His deafening silence speaks volumes. From all indications and evidences from recent books available from 2016 to date the police should question Trump
1339933819751833603 2020-12-18 22:01:32 +0800 <DianHeymann> @kylegriffin1 @TapestryofPeace @colbertlateshow So the right hardliners are envious of Jill  Biden's PhD. She is the first Flotus with a PhD.
1339931311734140929 2020-12-18 21:51:34 +0800 <DianHeymann> @JoyceWhiteVance Trump sold his conscience and  country to Putin.
1339919320156155905 2020-12-18 21:03:55 +0800 <DianHeymann> @MollieKatzen Spot on. It's no coincident. Trump is   burning the nation. He couldn't make it better. All sold out to Kremlin his allies for four years. Hillary warned us. The  consequen es terrible and gargantuan obstruction and destruction
1339842953846677504 2020-12-18 16:00:27 +0800 <DianHeymann> @kylegriffin1 Trump where are you? Busy destroying what  is left of America to Putin. Until the President Elect Biden takes over Trump will continue with the desecration of the temple US. How can he abandon the nation he swore to defend and protect. God bless America.
1339707104400171009 2020-12-18 07:00:38 +0800 <DianHeymann> @danielsgoldman A leader who loves superspreading the Covid 19 virus at rallies to get more of his supporters infected, infected family members and the WH. His preference over business conflicting interests matter most to IMPOTUS no surprise when Russia is declaring cyberwarfare he is silent
1339703336145186816 2020-12-18 06:45:40 +0800 <DianHeymann> @danielsgoldman Sold out. America Judas. Gross betrayal

1339699921138671623 2020-12-18 06:32:06 +0800 <DianHeymann> @RepSwalwell @holmes_62 Trust Trump is fully aware of the Russian espionage that is why he is nowhere to be found when over 3,,000 Americans will die and no word from him.Putin mounted the hacking albeit with Trump's backing by sacking the man in charge. Most treasonous traitor, destroyer. Lock him up

1338230693965557767 2020-12-14 05:13:55 +0800 <DianHeymann> @jelani9 This nation saw the slains of  Presidents, leaders of the progressive  and civil rights movement by suspected White Supremamists justified on conspiracy theories. The lives of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have openly come under threat from Trump and his cohorts rallies. Police?

The world watches raptly  as democracy is torn down with disinformation. Putin jubilates, the nation burns

1338048024334004227 2020-12-13 17:08:03 +0800 <DianHeymann> @TIME One thing you cannot take away from President Elect Joe Biden is that he remains calm in the midst of the storm. Great leadership.

POTUS is emboldening his associate militiamen, white Supremecists, Prince's private army for export as mercenaries. Trump is lighting the flames of hatred, racism and his base to take up arms and keep him in the WH although he lost to Biden

Dems leadership remain too silent on this It is true 20th January is the inauguration day but sore miserable Trump is sending wrong disturbing signals Lock him up. Sedition
1337516203384983555 2020-12-12 05:54:47 +0800 <DianHeymann> @kurteichenwald How a mere mortal can refuse to extend a little kindness to his neighbor because he weilds power and is wealthy.The level of hypocrisy and pretense is grave but for Christ sake do it for neighbors as the command says love your neighbor as yourself Moscow Mitch McConnell.
1337106899674800129 2020-12-11 02:48:21 +0800 <DianHeymann> @NYGovCuomo Congratulations for a well deserved award.
1337084573298126852 2020-12-11 01:19:38 +0800 <DianHeymann> @TomJChicago Trump is wrecking more harm than good before he leaves office. Trump a sore loser can't let go except to dismantle the system for Biden to face difficulties. From all indication he wants to set fire on America before 20th January. How the hell would you overturn an election.?
1337081934128828418 2020-12-11 01:09:09 +0800 <DianHeymann> @AVindman @realDonaldTrump @GOP Trump has not solved any peace in  the Middle East. He announces shoddy rehearsed victory in the region which is not reflected on the ground. Morocco has annexed a portion of land which does not belong. to her. Out of the blue Trump foolishly gives recognition to Morocco.
1337075730430259200 2020-12-11 00:44:30 +0800 <DianHeymann> @AVindman @realDonaldTrump @GOP Trump has never been held for all the crimes he has committed in his lifetime, the 22women he assaulted among many other suspected crimes. Yet  Barr has the effontery to execute capital punishment and go after Hunter. Trump your blood be upon your head from treason/Covid victims

Accidental president. No action, no plan for Covid19 after losing the election
1337041212583370754 2020-12-10 22:27:20 +0800 <DianHeymann> @politvidchannel This is a huge welcome news. It also shows the difference between the two men. Biden is  experienced and responsible, considerate to needs of others, not the me, me center of focus bereft of fellow feeling begging to be noticed always.
1336948733779566593 2020-12-10 16:19:52 +0800 <DianHeymann> @davida76321 J. F Kennedy said 'Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country.'

Please Putin can continue to help you. The country is worn out with you. Keep your hands off this country. At least 80 million people do not want you as president.
1333124588331560965 2020-11-30 03:04:04 +0800 <DianHeymann> @politvidchannel President Elect Joe Biden will become the 46th that very  day  he wants to launch his ill motivated, nefarious bid. America needs Joe today, his qualities of decency, respect for individuals, rights, empathy, kindness. Trump failed and it's over for him now. God bless America !
1333116305168363521 2020-11-30 02:31:09 +0800 <DianHeymann> @KellyO Trump team interferences in defence, pardon, elections claiming fraud and falsely accusing officers and institutions, throwing his weight around and cannot be dealt with because of immunity?.

1332021813321359363 2020-11-27 02:02:02 +0800 <DianHeymann> @politvidchannel Unity is a two way thing just like in any mutual relationship. Biden plan for unity is appreciatiable where Trump men respect him, yet as Biden tries to mend the fence they continue their nefarious ways to tear  https://t.co/954ezvnPrN olive branch where it's not needed. Priority
1332013441545105409 2020-11-27 01:28:46 +0800 <DianHeymann> @politvidchannel Biden, goodwill, goodness.But be careful with Trump and enablers. There are many Republicans for Biden and many others who saw you as alternative leader would you not consider the collision who delivered the victory are far better than Trump voter.Kindness must not be a done deal
1331987178658930691 2020-11-26 23:44:25 +0800 <DianHeymann> @glennkirschner2 Trump knows perfectly well he is guilty of crimes and in anticipation of prosecution he is freeing Flynn by pardon. Trump and enablers must come clean before a competent court of jurisdiction. They must come clean. Treasonous treacherous poison cover up.What you guilty of Trump?
1331981522304438272 2020-11-26 23:21:56 +0800 <DianHeymann> @politvidchannel Sue Trump, make him responsible for his public debts. He has been reckless with no shame and integrity. Trump needs to account for his stewardship. I wish all those states would hold him liable with the Covid pandemic trails he incurred apart from refusing to pay venues' fees.
1331929696314028032 2020-11-26 19:56:00 +0800 <DianHeymann> @StevenBeschloss NO, TRUMP IS NOT ABOVE THE LAW. THE CRIMES HE COMMITTED MUST BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURTS. ALL HIS LIFE MONEY HAS BOUGHT EVERYTHING HE WANTED AMERICANS VERSUS TRUMP
1331927828091297792 2020-11-26 19:48:34 +0800 <DianHeymann> @CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump Capital punishment is no longer attainable. Trump is so crude, inhuman, callous, is not merciful, shows no remorse or compassion   mortal as he is. Lies every second. He only pardons his criminal accomplices and himself. If he isn't Guilty why the pardons? Trump can't hide lockup

You Republicans associated yourselves with Putin championing Kremlin kompromat and oligarchs. Soviets and socialists calling the kettle black. So shameful and disgraceful.Joe lock them for Treason
1330960934307848195 2020-11-24 03:46:29 +0800 <DianHeymann> @natureofthings7 Perfectly agree with you subpoena Emily Murphy. She is not above the law. Trump is not above the law either. Americans voted for change for Joe Biden as President
1330957467061202945 2020-11-24 03:32:42 +0800 <DianHeymann> @glennkirschner2 I hope Biden does the right thing by letting the rule of law work. Ineptitude allowing Trump walk free from prosecution and crimes against the country will not be tolerated. America should work again
1330844235503988736 2020-11-23 20:02:46 +0800 <DianHeymann> @politvidchannel Biden has to fumigate the WH before setting foot there.

1329086370891984903 2020-11-18 23:37:38 +0800 <DianHeymann> @johnpavlovitz I perfectly agree with you Pavlovitz. The prolongesilence of Dem  leadership is damning and uneasy as if there are no balls. At least a condemnation of recent happenings where some Republicans are trying to turn the tide in Trump's favor after Biden's landslide win at the polls.
1328105646500274179 2020-11-16 06:40:35 +0800 <DianHeymann> @Speaker71111280 So sorry. terribly traumatic but stay strong and seek counseling.

1326621932876394507 2020-11-12 04:24:50 +0800 <DianHeymann> @washingtonpost Biggest joke of the moment. Trump's fed. budget for 2021 &amp; adamant transition will not happen?!! Law enforcement the option. Disgracefully sad.  Fired and voted out of office. Still violating the constitution with his enablers Mitch, Trump Pompeo  vagabonds,fugitives, criminals
1326621932876345345 2020-11-12 04:24:50 +0800 <DianHeymann> @TheRickyDavila Thank God for the life of a godly elected President Joe Biden not a religious hypocritical zealot who is calm. sensible, sensitive, enduring, peaceful, prevailing, intelligent and believes in science. Trumpism will not survive. Cult worship is eating Republicans up. Plutocrates
1326259667589271554 2020-11-11 04:25:20 +0800 <DianHeymann> @kaitlancollins Trump it's time you realized that you are not a king.. When you don't leave, you will be escorted out of the WH. Is that your preference?
1326253512666345479 2020-11-11 04:00:52 +0800 <DianHeymann> @brycetache Third world countries engage in coups to change leaders but they are fewer now even amidst conflicts cropping up from time to time. Trump is a con man ,a bully, assaulted 22women, untouchable but it's time to face the music. Thank you Pres Biden for having a heart for Americans
1326250597914390535 2020-11-11 03:49:17 +0800 <DianHeymann> @jimsciutto Please there is Covid 19 infection at the WH so VP Joe be careful going there.Fumigation before you step there.
1326248876349808643 2020-11-11 03:42:27 +0800 <DianHeymann> @kylegriffin1 President Elect Joe Biden whether Republicans fume, shout on the roof tops Trump has been fired for good. They cannot obstruct or subvert the will of the people. This is not one party state. Please a reminder that. Kremlin can contain Trump but not the nation he detests so much
1326246233317535744 2020-11-11 03:31:57 +0800 <DianHeymann> @jimsciutto @SecPompeo Crazy, lust for power. Democracy works you cannot continue to sell America for your gluttonous egocentriism infantile minds-  Moscow Mitch, Leningrad Lindsey Graham, Pompeo and all enablers of Trump. Respect the constitution instead of pushing your self interest agenda SHAME
1326241857014296577 2020-11-11 03:14:33 +0800 <DianHeymann> @kenolin1 @LindseyGrahamSC What a big joke Pompeo insipid poisonous viper. Trump has been fired period. The people have spoken. The voice of the people is the voice of God. What a sham even third world countries are better than this. America the greatest will never go down in the flames set by Trump, Mitch
1326240121432264710 2020-11-11 03:07:39 +0800 <DianHeymann> @kenolin1 @LindseyGrahamSC These Republicans have sold their souls to Satan. By escalating the war drums they are senseless morons serving the interest of their paid master Putin. The leadership of the Republican party is just a bunch of rif rafs greedy bustards wielding sycophantic miscaculated power.
1326237732423786498 2020-11-11 02:58:10 +0800 <DianHeymann> @mmpadellan Pompeo's pronouncement is a disgrace. An  American A huge entanglement and a laughingstock in international circles.

1326233881805283329 2020-11-11 02:42:52 +0800 <DianHeymann> @MeidasTouch Inflated ballots happens in third world countries and where authoritarian rule prevails. This should be seriously investigated to avert future philanderers. All votes should not exude population. A problem somewhere, no one noticed. Ivanka's voting machines. Weird

1325137166968606720 2020-11-08 02:04:55 +0800 <DianHeymann> @MegLavDC Moscow Mitch should mind his own party. Biden is more experienced and dignified than the Republicans' hypocrisy, cruelty and inhumanity. As a leader of his party he  was on the side of evil inclinations towards the people.
1325137165475606528 2020-11-08 02:04:54 +0800 <DianHeymann> @pleasesaveour @karolcummins Lashing out loudly is not the best, close your ranks and ideological differences. Of course Trump sold socialism to Latinos in Florida and they believed him. So the extreme leftists should be careful. This is a moment in history the world needs Biden not only America. Unite

1324504442457231365 2020-11-06 08:10:41 +0800 <DianHeymann> @HKrassenstein Trump's biggest lying today. Trump failed at the polls. The people have spoken. Accept what you cannot change. You crafted everything up to this stage when votes would have been counted earlier. Shame Trump you are not fit for the office. Fake president usurper.
1324502684704116746 2020-11-06 08:03:42 +0800 <DianHeymann> @ddale8 Trump has been lying all his life but presidential cowardly manipulation tied to lies conceivably inaccurate is most dishonest, not honorable, disceitful and doesn't fit the profile of the leader of the greatest nation on earth.Trump you lost  give way to the next President Biden
1324488989596897285 2020-11-06 07:09:17 +0800 <DianHeymann> @sgtmiller1255 So sorry for your loss.
1324380677337452545 2020-11-05 23:58:53 +0800 <DianHeymann> @HKrassenstein Dangerously deranged mentality urging followers to take up arms against the winning Dems. The people have spoken you can't continue. Leave to Moscow if you will. Evetyone is tired of you. Violence will never Win.

1322622058447122432 2020-11-01 03:30:46 +0800 <DianHeymann> @CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump Trump is sending wrong signals to his supporters thro in- person rallies with no respect for the Covid 19 protocols.He is leaving in his wake deaths and infection. Driven by ego, selfishness and cruelty he knows the repercussions of his careless multiple actions Vote Trump out

1322068171659059201 2020-10-30 14:49:49 +0800 <DianHeymann> @hshaban @connie_rodeconn Presidential superspreader of the Covid 19 in America. Hard to believe with the knowledge the world has of the virus that Trump will consciously, unhingedly rally supporters to dishout the virus Trump can't be a patriot when he is a major source of multiple killings Vote him out

Shoving and dragging by pulling the hair and poo to the ground. Racism of white power police. How long shall this  atrocious, genocidal menace of the black or brown person continue?
1320460918040465414 2020-10-26 04:23:10 +0800 <DianHeymann> @kaitlancollins The super spreaders are at it for votes. They have infested the  WH and now innocent citizens are carrying the brunt. Meanwhile the WH officials are implicitly covering up for Pence and Trump both suspected carriers spreading carelessly regardless of their supporters perishing
1318594113994883078 2020-10-21 00:45:09 +0800 <DianHeymann> @HKrassenstein Coney did that to Hillary. Barr is following the same trend.
1317862304361402369 2020-10-19 00:17:12 +0800 <DianHeymann> @RBReich Make sure your vote is for Biden and  not Trump. Cross check that the machine didn't deliver your to Trump. This is happening in some places. It happened without noticing in 2016. No not 2020

Hilary is a great politician,she survived and has since moved on. A great leader.
1309208866731819011 2020-09-25 03:11:32 +0800 <DianHeymann> @clairecmc What went wrong America for Russia to indulge itself in  deciding who should lead this great nation. Whilst Trump is hypocritical he confirmed yesterday without mincing words but the voice of the people is God's. Vote blue massively to uproot evil from the Oval office.

1306904681315213314 2020-09-18 18:35:31 +0800 <DianHeymann> @kstreet111 Trump must stop spreading the Corona virus purposely in exchange for votes. Blindly and blisteringly he injects the crowds with the virus. Horror is every he holds rallies non stop.Knowingly he is killing his ignorant deorables who listen to hateful jibes. Stop the vicious P0TUS
1306901950068391938 2020-09-18 18:24:40 +0800 <DianHeymann> @kstreet111 Trump spreads COVID19  more than any human being who is conscious of the disease. The supporters he calls 'disgusting'behind them but loves canvassing for their votes, yet deliberately infecting them with no social distancing or face mask. A real leader will not want them to die.
1306721230456844289 2020-09-18 06:26:33 +0800 <DianHeymann> @CraigDMauger A shameful deed for militiamen trying to takeover a city. Gradually the hen is coming home to roost. Dangerous, primitive and  unbecoming in modern day America  that can prevail in a third world country. Democracy can not give way to an authoritarian regime no never. Trump retire
1305598400784732160 2020-09-15 04:04:50 +0800 <DianHeymann> @politvidchannel This is a democracy! Moron the Kremlin plot thickens by the day but America is the greatest nation on earth. It can't be brought that low. God forbid as other nations look up to her for leadership lacking today in the world. "In God we trust"
1305580893264846848 2020-09-15 02:55:16 +0800 <DianHeymann> @JuliaDavisNews This man needs to be arrested, Trump prefers dictators over Biden
1305550741881393155 2020-09-15 00:55:27 +0800 <DianHeymann> @samstein I agree with you it's wrong.
1305538939726561283 2020-09-15 00:08:33 +0800 <DianHeymann> @MeidasTouch @realDonaldTrump The mindset of a con man prepared to kill or do anything at power, steal, maim, lie, insult,rage rant, suppress. subdue, humiliate, swear, fool people mislead, deceive, lure, preaches only vice. Trump is a huge satanic evil. Vote him out
1305535946679607302 2020-09-14 23:56:40 +0800 <DianHeymann> @ThePubliusUSA As  November elections draw closer the man made and natural fires burn, escalating job losses amidst deaths from the pandemic Trump resolutely leads crowds, no social distancing purposely to win votes mindless if they die. This inhuman POTUS must retire if he has conscience
1305533925633204227 2020-09-14 23:48:38 +0800 <DianHeymann> @ThePubliusUSA The world watches with rapt attention. Some laugh at the leadership even third world countries think Trump is a sick man mentally. The GOPers are treacherously dangerous enablers who sold what the rest of the world couldn't believe America. Why Republicans? Why? He is not.
1305531698340409344 2020-09-14 23:39:47 +0800 <DianHeymann> @ThePubliusUSA Decency.decorum is not part of POTUS' language. Trump presides over those he kills negligently be it from COVID19 or at his rallies,cities He is spreading the virus. A lap dog of Kremlin.Unbelievable that the beloved nation could simply be turned Putin's annexed authoritarian
1305529549652930567 2020-09-14 23:31:14 +0800 <DianHeymann> Posterity can't pardon Mitch McConnell and Trumpers who got gold to betray America to her arch rivals. The deal is sealed and a done deal but how about the ignoramus who Trump keeps infecting with the virus at his rallies. The nation is fed on lies and Soviet propaganda.
1304132897658503168 2020-09-11 03:01:27 +0800 <DianHeymann> @tribelaw 'Republican Senators' seem timid, fearful of Trump's  bullish tantrums and erratic rants . Until they get the balls they wouldn't stand up to him. They jump to POTUS' defence like weaklings morally inept and mentally  bankrupt but partisanly unified in rescue of Trump cult.
1304058899381858304 2020-09-10 22:07:24 +0800 <DianHeymann> @Broad1Big @brycetache No one could stop Trump. These are dark times. The tell all books are historic. Money, a motivation for some,but boldness, courage and patriotism for the heroic effort of Bob Woodward, Mary Trump and few others are speaking to power.  Refusal to appear at impeachment, then books

1302221479040503809 2020-09-05 20:26:09 +0800 <DianHeymann> @Amy_Siskind 'This is not a coincidence.' Voter Suppression.Late arrival of votes presumably will not be counted or added.Votes not  confirmed is an issue because it lessens a party's votes. Please this is well intended by Trump to reduce Dems votes with the conniviance of Dejoy. Too late?
1302218188659318784 2020-09-05 20:13:04 +0800 <DianHeymann> @Amy_Siskind A ploy, prelude to delayed votes not counted in Dems strongholds. Dejoy had dismantled all the equipment b4 he went to Congress to assure them. It was a huge fiasco, deceitful. Dejoy wasn't conclusive.Evasively he repeatedly said the equipment could not be returned. Mischievous
1302209537584377857 2020-09-05 19:38:42 +0800 <DianHeymann> @Amy_Siskind Trump enablers doing the Ruski bidding cannot forever sell America to Putin for gold. They lost their consciences to greed and avarice. But America will be rescued by able men and women of courage, face off Trump with all the orchestrated violence,mail boxes dismantled. Vote.
1302204620526235649 2020-09-05 19:19:09 +0800 <DianHeymann> @Amy_Siskind Patriotic Americans must rise above partisan.Those in the now Trumpian Party and GOP. It is deeply disturbing for  some Senators to ally with Kremlin courting  Trump's persona as god of the Russian alliance. Disgracefully the sycophants see no evil by enabling Moscow to dump USA
1301923931625082881 2020-09-05 00:43:48 +0800 <DianHeymann> @SteveSchmidtSES Trump serves Russian interest than the nation's by shielding the bounty given to Afghan soldiers to kill  American soldiers by Vladimir. Donnie further denigrates them as 'suckers and losers'. He prefers Putin 's military. Stunningly Trump is the POTUS.Paradoxically steal to win
1301655980552355840 2020-09-04 06:59:04 +0800 <DianHeymann> @SymoneDSanders Joe Biden is a real peaceful man by nature comparison with impeached dictator, close ally of Kremlin. Joe showed human compassion, empathy which America hasn't seen in almost Four years of Trump. Biden was at Kenosha yes he was. And not only that he was in touch with the Blakes
1301650982842126338 2020-09-04 06:39:12 +0800 <DianHeymann> @GOPLeader Your party is in league with Putin who has replaced the North Atlantic Alliance hence the Republican party is Socialist. Chew only what you can  bite and don't throw out the carcass. Truth over propaganda injected with poisonous vibes
1300897765598408705 2020-09-02 04:46:11 +0800 <DianHeymann> @tribelaw @MTmarilyn2 Russians are once again interferring in the internal affairs of America.
1300829570799677440 2020-09-02 00:15:12 +0800 <DianHeymann> @JoyAnnReid Trump it is time for you to bow out of the presidency. Retire , unfit for the job. Liar with too many liabilities and baggages of crisis, blood and deaths. This is not America
1300827904960585728 2020-09-02 00:08:35 +0800 <DianHeymann> @ThePubliusUSA So what is Trump hiding from the nation that he keeps fighting against disclosure.
1300826864513159168 2020-09-02 00:04:27 +0800 <DianHeymann> @JoeBiden Why would a normal president want to bring down America on its knees ?Trump does and this is deeply frightening. GOP enables Trump to the gutter unhinged to destroy the greatest nation on earth. They are all in his pocket.
1300727543654420480 2020-09-01 17:29:47 +0800 <DianHeymann> @HLStockenstrom Boogaloo boys and other fascist vigilante groups are being used to terrorise Dems supporters. Trump will stop at nothing but go on to use prisoners With Barr 's help. Does he want blood bath, massacres all over of Dems. A clear sign of Russia alliance and tactics. Trump is unfit
1300692581857333248 2020-09-01 15:10:51 +0800 <DianHeymann> @funder I do agree 'more of this everyday' 'more of this everyday'
