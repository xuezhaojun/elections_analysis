1336554502552510464 2020-12-09 14:13:20 +0800 <pepsiroo> @Bates19C @JakeHepple1 Absolutely right!

It's now been ruined and I suspect a major downturn in ticket sales will follow along with other associated revenue.   Idiots must be running the show.

Of course, they'd concede and the one with him a Bond Girl, in particular, was hilarious.  What changed?

Because they were so uncomfortable, most toddlers were happy to be out of them by 2.  There was no need to hassle them but was a natural progression.

The fact they were taking profits from the company didn't seem to come into the calculation. Presumably that's changed in recent years.

1318527101314662400 2020-10-20 20:18:52 +0800 <pepsiroo> @firstyorks2017 I don't think there's any law that says you can't give a job to who you want but employers should stop wasting everyone's time by advertising and giving people false hope.  Local policy may say it must be advertised but not the law.  Let me know if not correct.

One open fire in the living room and no other heat in the freezing cold house.  No double glazing.

1315892318894010368 2020-10-13 13:49:11 +0800 <pepsiroo> So 5.1m people will not be getting railcards extended or refunded despite most of the advice being against rail travel.   Many private orgs e.g. gyms have done this, why not the rail industry?
