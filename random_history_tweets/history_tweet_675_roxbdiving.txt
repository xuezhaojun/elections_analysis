1343979225309700099 2020-12-30 01:56:31 +0800 <roxbdiving> @therecount First, why isn't mcconnell in a mask?!! Secondly, how can he sleep at night?!! I know he is made up of carbon, breathes and blood runs through his veins but nothing else indicates life!!!
1343582838097063936 2020-12-28 23:41:25 +0800 <roxbdiving> @realDonaldTrump And 333,000+ deaths are YOUR fault!!!
1343582077376200706 2020-12-28 23:38:24 +0800 <roxbdiving> @realDonaldTrump I liked how you begrudgingly signed the bill after 5 days of golf; what did Lindsey put you up to it?! You do not give a second of care for any other human unless it can benefit you personally. Stop pretending to care, we know better!!
1341808102086238208 2020-12-24 02:09:15 +0800 <roxbdiving> Just got out of Twitter jail...my post about #MoscowMitch was worth it!!
1341807871680540673 2020-12-24 02:08:20 +0800 <roxbdiving> @NC_Governor Based on the latest figures, just wondering when more realistic restrictions will be put into place?! Bars, gyms, hair dressers open, no social distancing and questionable mask practices?! TAKE A STAND if you do not enforce no one else will #lookatwhateuropeisdoing  https://t.co/RLr3jGUybD
1341766249181802496 2020-12-23 23:22:57 +0800 <roxbdiving> @GrahamAllen_1 @SpeakerPelosi How about all the corporations that @senatemajldr sought to protect in this bill vs actual people. A 500 page relief bill is nothing more than corporate quid pro quo and protecting donors $$$. Sad you can't see that!!!

1336456974721028097 2020-12-09 07:45:47 +0800 <roxbdiving> Today @RoyCooperNC rolled back restrictions so that all stores/restaurants close by 10pm. I know few people that eat  or shop past 10pm....HOW is that helping?!!

1330612461901393920 2020-11-23 04:41:47 +0800 <roxbdiving> I was traveling out-of-state with my daughter this week for college visits. In every state people were respectful and wore mask, even at the gas pump. I get back to NC and no mask. Hello @RoyCooperNC ?!!

1330608810751373312 2020-11-23 04:27:16 +0800 <roxbdiving> @Angry_Staffer Sorry to disagree. I would never get a 1st generation vaccine especially one that has expedited clinical trials.

1325799142719975427 2020-11-09 21:55:22 +0800 <roxbdiving> Did I read correctly that every President BUT trump has thrown out the ceremonial pitch? Ohhh that's right, trump was an illegitimate president so yah, he did not count. Sides he was probably too afraid to pitch given he has not a lick of athletic ability.

And secondly, US autopsy report would show the CAUSE of death. The patient may have other comorbidities but COVID is what killed them!

1316427898379739141 2020-10-15 01:17:23 +0800 <roxbdiving> @senatemajldr said in his debate that vaccines were already being developed, no corners were being cut and yet clinical trials were not completed. Lets be clear, without "completed" clinical trials, vaccines and meds are NOT safe for production that is the whole point of trials!!
1316425429100703744 2020-10-15 01:07:34 +0800 <roxbdiving> @crzyfkinworld It's going to be the white piece of paper Amy Coney Barrett held up!
1316425160199634953 2020-10-15 01:06:30 +0800 <roxbdiving> I know it's the job opportunity of a lifetime but Amy Coney Barrett is not ready for a lifetime appointment nor is the timing of this right. If she had any morality, she would recuse her nomination until after the election!!
1315840158512619520 2020-10-13 10:21:55 +0800 <roxbdiving> Fantastic debate tonight @AmyMcGrathKY, what we wouldn't do to have you in NC! Kentucky needs you!!
1315828995276111873 2020-10-13 09:37:34 +0800 <roxbdiving> @senatemajldr and "his" relief pkg helps businesses from being sued due to neglect from COVID and not individual americans from losing their job, losing their home &amp; putting food on the table! That is why Pelosi has declined your pkg! @AmyMcGrathKY wants to help everyone esp KY!
1315827717577867264 2020-10-13 09:32:29 +0800 <roxbdiving> Anyone that believes the COVID vaccine is the single source of truth is sorely mistaken. The 1st generation vacc is based on virus "at that point in time" and does not cover mutations since then. The vacc just like the flu shot will help some but not all @senatemajldr is wrong!
1315826310908960771 2020-10-13 09:26:54 +0800 <roxbdiving> @senatemajldr just said in the debate with @AmyMcGrathKY that vaccines are being created but that corners are not being cut. If vaccines are being created without completimg clinical trials that IS cutting corners!!

1314610954760486912 2020-10-10 00:57:30 +0800 <roxbdiving> @realDonaldTrump You have an EXCUSE for EVERYTHING! This one too big, this one too short, this one too liberal jesus don how in the hell did you ever get married?! Ohh right....money you had to buy love!!

1314610014322126848 2020-10-10 00:53:46 +0800 <roxbdiving> @kayleighmcenany First Kayleigh, you do not like it when people put words in your mouth so respect that you would not do the same with @JoeBiden !!  Americans do deserve a clear answer. Who does @realDonaldTrump owe, $440 Million to?!
1314588499190964227 2020-10-09 23:28:16 +0800 <roxbdiving> @kayleighmcenany Voters deserve a CLEAR ANSWER to who @realDonaldTrump owes $440 MILLION to!!
1314579976524529666 2020-10-09 22:54:24 +0800 <roxbdiving> @NikkiHaley The American people deserve to know who @realDonaldTrump owes $440Million to!!
1314579682491236352 2020-10-09 22:53:14 +0800 <roxbdiving> @kayleighmcenany @JoeBiden The position to debate @JoeBiden is completely up to trump. If @realDonaldTrump doesn't debate that is HIS CHOICE and has nothing to do with the Commission!! Man up or Stand Down and stop blaming others!
1314578624511700995 2020-10-09 22:49:02 +0800 <roxbdiving> @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/Xe4838ld3O
1314578472845676546 2020-10-09 22:48:26 +0800 <roxbdiving> The irony that @realDonaldTrump says a woman should be "punished" for an abortion and yet he received a trial COVID cocktail from fetal stem cells and as quoted by him "it was his idea"!
1314313212221894662 2020-10-09 05:14:23 +0800 <roxbdiving> @kayleighmcenany @Mike_Pence If you have to type that then you are trying to convince the base!! Not very convincing!!

1314020556010905600 2020-10-08 09:51:28 +0800 <roxbdiving> I've had enough of this moderator not shutting up Pence when he repeatedly runs over in time just rambling bullshit!

1314019095793274881 2020-10-08 09:45:40 +0800 <roxbdiving> Watching stepford pence on stage with his syrupy regurgitation of bullshit is mind boggling, not sure I can take much more!!

1313811171997364224 2020-10-07 19:59:27 +0800 <roxbdiving> @realDonaldTrump NO North Carolina is not, our elections are legit and will legitimately vote your ass out!
1313810865737662464 2020-10-07 19:58:14 +0800 <roxbdiving> @realDonaldTrump BECAUSE HE IS NOT LYING LIKE YOU!! Good try #coviddonthecon
1313559270823206912 2020-10-07 03:18:29 +0800 <roxbdiving> @realDonaldTrump And yet here you are you POSITIVE with COVID!
1313557773817442307 2020-10-07 03:12:32 +0800 <roxbdiving> @realDonaldTrump Polls support americans receiving COVID relief not supporting another SCOTUS nomination. You will continue to lose at the ballot box if you do not put working class first! Pass the damn relief and stop putting people's very lives at risk!!
1313555864612220928 2020-10-07 03:04:57 +0800 <roxbdiving> @johnysonthespot @LungMD01 @JoeBiden If the orange bafoon repeats last antics, walk off stage and when the he is ready to debate like a gentleman and a candidate he will come back!
1313538993804500992 2020-10-07 01:57:55 +0800 <roxbdiving> Time to Leave, Time for Jail, Time to end this God awful Tale!
1313538992504221696 2020-10-07 01:57:54 +0800 <roxbdiving> #coviddon is a Con That lives in a house he did not espouse. He sells the oil like a snake, And will forever be US's biggest mistake. Don owes Billions to whom we do not know, But I bet the banker will come calling and the dish will flow.
1313537293874069504 2020-10-07 01:51:09 +0800 <roxbdiving> @realDonaldTrump You FELL in the DEBATE with @JoeBiden. You FELL to COVID when you said it was a HOAX and continue to FALL in the POLLS!!! See a pattern here!!
1313534804604968960 2020-10-07 01:41:16 +0800 <roxbdiving> @realDonaldTrump STOCK MARKET only helps the wealthy and yes they are even richer under your administration!! You care for no one especially not the average American! Let's talk about who you owe billions to donnie!!!!
1313494376002314251 2020-10-06 23:00:37 +0800 <roxbdiving> @thehill @prevostscifi Polls do not matter when a foreign power is embedded in an election. VOTE!

1313492780359061507 2020-10-06 22:54:17 +0800 <roxbdiving> Wow Chris must have been feeling so proud of yourself that night. Enjoy your deplorable, irresponsible lack of ethics as karma has circled around and she won't play fair either!
1313490499551068166 2020-10-06 22:45:13 +0800 <roxbdiving> @realDonaldTrump THIS IS NOT TRUE!!!! A few thousand die every year to the flu not 212,000+ to COVID!! Stop spreading misinformation as YOU will continue to get people killed!!!
1313489798850637828 2020-10-06 22:42:26 +0800 <roxbdiving> @IAmJulesWard @Antswifey4life Clearly they did not offer picture books as he discharged himself. WTH did he learn?!
1313486777710260231 2020-10-06 22:30:25 +0800 <roxbdiving> Serious question, when people get tested for COVID, is the test able to determine which strain it is meaning west coast/east coast? A doctor friend shared that east coast was much more aggressive and symptomatic.
1313485172587868161 2020-10-06 22:24:03 +0800 <roxbdiving> @realDonaldTrump First, it's called steroids! And two, that statement will now kill thousands more Americans. Your incompetence and irresponsibility is beyond reproach!! Who has to die before you take this serious?!!
1313484201560334336 2020-10-06 22:20:11 +0800 <roxbdiving> Trump's action yesterday was the epitome of narcissism. To discharge yourself only to go to a place where numerous individuals are responsible for you and vulnerable to catching COVID is a whole new level of irresponsible!! Only dictators behave like that! #whitehouselivesmatter

1312766703135330305 2020-10-04 22:49:06 +0800 <roxbdiving> Stop running your campaign @JoeBiden as if you are running against a normal opponent. You were prepared in the debate on issues but you were not prepared for trump's chaos.Bring on @MaryLTrump as an advisor to your campaign! She can consult on donald and the psychology as well!!

1311742110257876992 2020-10-02 02:57:44 +0800 <roxbdiving> @FrankSowa1 Time for all governors to take a stand for their states and not condone this behavior and set the repercussions for any malfeasance!! @RoyCooperNC protect NC!!
1311741054069202950 2020-10-02 02:53:32 +0800 <roxbdiving> @realDonaldTrump No don, you embarrassed yourself and you made a mockery of a democratic process that Americans have used to vet candidates on issues. You should have been forced off stage as you clearly were not presidential nor behaving in the manner that we expect of our candidates!!
1311404944331886594 2020-10-01 04:37:58 +0800 <roxbdiving> After reading about trump's taxes it occurred to me that he is using the IRS like his own private bank. Ridiculous deductions, unbelievable multi-million $ refunds?! I am at a loss and am stunned how the Gov't allowed this to happen?! The CPA firm should also be held accountable!

1311122306824048646 2020-09-30 09:54:52 +0800 <roxbdiving> This debate is a free-for-all and trump's strategy is to interrupt so that he doesn't have to address facts and be held accountable. I could come through the TV and shut trump up myself!! #shuttrumpup

1306977373586427905 2020-09-18 23:24:22 +0800 <roxbdiving> @AudreyStJames1 Gorgeous...thank you for sharing!
1306976982513717253 2020-09-18 23:22:49 +0800 <roxbdiving> Sooo... I requested early ballots for me and my husband (just in case due to covid). Somehow we have received duplicates. Is that a ploy to get us to vote twice/make our votes ineligible. Anyone else have this?
1306976110949920768 2020-09-18 23:19:21 +0800 <roxbdiving> @RhoniDu I am so sorry Rhonda but know you do not need to tell her goodbye. Tell her you love her (she does hear you) and that you will see her again. She will always be with you...in heart and spirit!! ‚ô°
1306975159945920513 2020-09-18 23:15:35 +0800 <roxbdiving> @chipfranklin @JoeBiden Standing in line for as long as it takes!!

1306953467634880512 2020-09-18 21:49:23 +0800 <roxbdiving> @kylecupp I am so incredibly sorry for your loss, I can't even begin to imagine!! Sending prayers your way to help during this difficult time!! ‚ô°

1306757477912977408 2020-09-18 08:50:35 +0800 <roxbdiving> @markknoller Yea Mark Meadows...you first. No way in hell I would take a 1st generation vaccine from an administration who rushed to push it out and who also thought it ok to inject clorox. Moving on!
1306756079678885889 2020-09-18 08:45:02 +0800 <roxbdiving> @itsJeffTiedrich That's just the # that came forward. What about all the women/teenagers that did not!!
1306750275982626816 2020-09-18 08:21:58 +0800 <roxbdiving> I signed Jon Stewart's petition to help veterans suffering from exposure to burn pit toxins. Please sign it, too.  https://t.co/UugG2GxVag
1306288868883419137 2020-09-17 01:48:30 +0800 <roxbdiving> @thehill @Pontifex I seriously do not believe this is the path you wish for your followers or your church?!!!

1306214531400597506 2020-09-16 20:53:07 +0800 <roxbdiving> @BillResitance @GOPLeader THIS!!  üëá A MUST WATCH FOR EVERYONE and yes...that means you GOP, Republicans and Independents!!! We are past the time that enough is enough!!
1305969200561876992 2020-09-16 04:38:15 +0800 <roxbdiving> ExxonMobil has been pumping money into Alaska's grueling Iditarod dogsled race since 1978, fueling dog deaths, suffering, and neglect. Please, tell @exxonmobil to stop sponsoring the Iditarod:  https://t.co/vF7dsNGURT. Via @PETA
1305867637684084736 2020-09-15 21:54:41 +0800 <roxbdiving> I am pissed that @realDonaldTrump is holding yet another rally in NC when our COVID #'s are climbing. Worst yet he has the audacity to go to Fayetteville..hasn't he disrespected and hurt military families enough!! @RoyCooperNC - why are you allowing this?!
1305866831614402561 2020-09-15 21:51:29 +0800 <roxbdiving> @realDonaldTrump But yet you didn't want to share  COVID details in February to prevent a panic and yet here you are?!!
1305218537749913600 2020-09-14 02:55:23 +0800 <roxbdiving> @AngrierWHStaff And the animals!!!!  https://t.co/hFZMcekuUI
1304907341159170050 2020-09-13 06:18:48 +0800 <roxbdiving> @realDonaldTrump @OANN What have you done in favor of Hispanics...not one damn thing!!! #hispanicslovebiden  #hispanicsvotetrumpout  #hispanicsforfacts  #hispanicsfortruth
1304904062693933057 2020-09-13 06:05:47 +0800 <roxbdiving> North Carolinians-our COVID #'s continue to increase and yet trump was allowed in our state to hold rallies which contained hundreds of people in close proximity, many without masks. @RoyCooperNC.THIS CANNOT BE ALLOWED AGAIN!Take a stand for North Carolina you were voted 4 that!!
1303861614375043072 2020-09-10 09:03:28 +0800 <roxbdiving> @realDonaldTrump Now? You've had 3 1/2 years to take care of seniors. You failed them then and you are failing them now. You have NO plan and NO intention of helping them. STOP LYING!!!
1303508990144512006 2020-09-09 09:42:15 +0800 <roxbdiving> @tedcruz Bet you are really feeling the loyalty and devotion tonight knowing that trump personally approved the attack ads on your father!! 1st disparaging comments about your wife and now confirmed reports on your father. I would imagine a husband and son would have enough?!!
1303506309401239553 2020-09-09 09:31:36 +0800 <roxbdiving> @LaceyVoteDem @mmpadellan Watching this too....unbelievable!
1303506185677688834 2020-09-09 09:31:07 +0800 <roxbdiving> @Covfefe_For_All @46mingo I have been there many times before and there is nothing that can ease this pain. Try and remember all the good times together, she would not want you to grieve or suffer. I'll be sending prayers your way!! ‚ô°
1303486408770936833 2020-09-09 08:12:32 +0800 <roxbdiving> @LouiseMensch @lauferlaw @realDonaldTrump @KamalaHarris Just brilliant, a campaign event in my state with no social distancing and objectionable use of face masks. There goes our #'s again!!!  #noncfortrump
1302966416514199552 2020-09-07 21:46:16 +0800 <roxbdiving> @SRuhle @stevenmnuchin1 That would make my year...I'll bring the popcorn Stephanie!!
1302964568227012608 2020-09-07 21:38:55 +0800 <roxbdiving> @tedcruz Hey Ted - want to talk about donors, who is putting money in your pockets?!
1302963549585768448 2020-09-07 21:34:52 +0800 <roxbdiving> @realDonaldTrump Now THAT is laughable!! You have the worst marks of ANY country and the US has had more deaths than ANY country. If your marks were so high you wouldnt be reporting this 9 months post start of pandemic. You are a pathetic loser and the marks prove it!!!
1302637989097545731 2020-09-07 00:01:13 +0800 <roxbdiving> @tonyposnanski I think you might have to define "loving". Trump would use that grotesque display of molesting the flag pole on numerous occassions.
1302636827107643393 2020-09-06 23:56:36 +0800 <roxbdiving> @BillKristol I think if our country matched the viewpoint of this sleazy, entitled, pathetic loser, we'd have no military!

1301298486147776514 2020-09-03 07:18:30 +0800 <roxbdiving> @D_jeneration @JoeBiden I'm not sure how you can say Joe will be boring when he will be spending every waking hour fixing trump's catastrophic mess?!!!
1301191660190212098 2020-09-03 00:14:01 +0800 <roxbdiving> @chipfranklin This is GREAT but PLEASE wear masks appropriately!!
1301162877131386882 2020-09-02 22:19:39 +0800 <roxbdiving> @hjelle_brian @46mingo I know, pretty pissed about that one too!
1300839777575600129 2020-09-02 00:55:46 +0800 <roxbdiving> @ProjectLincoln North Carolina is READY!!
1300615078459441152 2020-09-01 10:02:53 +0800 <roxbdiving> @mog7546 I work very closely with Sweden and they will tell you it did not work! Employees are still working from home as it is not safe to be in an office even while social distancing!!
1300611193191661568 2020-09-01 09:47:27 +0800 <roxbdiving> @ZevShalev @Welshsprout The American people have every right to know our president is well and capable to do his job!
