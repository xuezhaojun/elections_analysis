1343676277224574980 2020-12-29 05:52:43 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @Lemondeselon1 @D_Shelf I agree to an extent, but I'm not really a fan of the term either. I much prefer "European" or "European Decended."
1343669608373493761 2020-12-29 05:26:13 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @Lemondeselon1 @D_Shelf I think the term "West" has come to mean Liberal in modern times. I'm not saying "Europe" or "European Civilization" is based on the enlightenment. "Western-style democracy" means Liberal Democracy. I can give you examples of people saying the West was founded on liberalism.
1343662938603868162 2020-12-29 04:59:43 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @ClanDestiny91 This is the reason why there is an anti-British line of thought running through British Ethnonationalist spheres. It's something that needs to be eradicated if we intend to move forwards and make nationalism sellable.
1343648247856967682 2020-12-29 04:01:20 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @IvetMachova The actual NazBol was an attempt to unite the Far Right and Far Left against Liberalism in Russia in the 90s. Basically, anyone who says they are NazBol in 2020 are just Strasserites. Bolshevism is fundamentally anti-nationalist, you can't be a nationalist and a bolshevik.
1343645879392210944 2020-12-29 03:51:56 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @D_Shelf @Lemondeselon1 I'll leave Jakes and Dangerfield aside, but they have made arguments that sound a lot like what I'm describing. So why does Molyneux want to preserve a white majority? I think it's because he sees outsiders as not in line with his values. They may, of course, be other reasons.
1343644706434068481 2020-12-29 03:47:16 +0800 <OakeRoyal> The modern concept of nationhood (post-Westphalia) is based on liberal nonsence like the social contract that puts down nationality to simply a utilitarian decision rather than a tribal association, as well. This is why I'm reluctant to associate myself with the label.
1343642823778848769 2020-12-29 03:39:47 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @D_Shelf @Lemondeselon1 There are definitely ethnonationalists who want to preserve a white majority because of muh rights and muh freedoms in muh liberal democracy. Jakes, Dangerfield, Stefan Molyneux to name a few.
1343639294443925504 2020-12-29 03:25:46 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @Lemondeselon1 Yes, it is. I've heard Dangerfield and Jakes makes arguments that sound like they are trying to defend the Liberal West from Reactionary Outsiders. I'm using the classical definition of Liberalism, not the modern one.
1343638660709801984 2020-12-29 03:23:14 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @D_Shelf @Lemondeselon1 Erm.. well Yes and No. I don't think the Romans or Greeks ever called themselves "Western." When people say "The West" or "Western Values" they mean Classic Liberalism or post-Westphalia Liberalism based nations. If I said "European civilization" your criticism would be correct.
1343637563005931523 2020-12-29 03:18:53 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @IvetMachova Don't exist
1343635279895277568 2020-12-29 03:09:48 +0800 <OakeRoyal> 90% of "nationalists" are basically just liberals. "Western civilization" is built on the enlightenment and that is what civic and cultural nationalists seek to defend. Even some ethnonationalists say we need to stop the replacement to preserve "western (liberal) values."

1343008491116634118 2020-12-27 09:39:10 +0800 <OakeRoyal> My message to Amy: it is natural having grown up in a society where pluralism, individualism and blank slateism are drilled into you to feel bad for expressing your collective interests. The answer is to throw out this framework completely and move towards something more tangible
1343007146980605952 2020-12-27 09:33:50 +0800 <OakeRoyal> It's morally correct to act in your collective &amp; individual self-interest. Humans wouldn't have survived if they didn't. Liberalism has made Europeans think this is wrong. This is immoral, as it creates an imbalance between us and other groups that do act in their self-interest.

1335376366049619968 2020-12-06 08:11:50 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @sevenman96 @AC96772343 You're correct that it wasn't natural, it should have closed gradually over time as it became unprofitable. It's just governments were too scared of the population until Maggie Thatcher came.
1335318746764816391 2020-12-06 04:22:52 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @AC96772343 The reason manufacturing is moving out of China is that wages are increasing, meaning it's cheaper to make things elsewhere. The reason that we have a generation working in Tesco rather than down a coal mine is because A. People prefer it and B. It's valued higher by the market.
1335312488586506240 2020-12-06 03:58:00 +0800 <OakeRoyal> It's frankly misguided to think that we can or even should move back to a primary manufacturing based economy. We moved away from it as high skilled or service jobs are better paid and are nicer. China's quality of life is improving as they transition to a service economy.

1334916989756862464 2020-12-05 01:46:26 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @HMS_Haddock The issue is though that I'm very ideological and see things in very black and white ways. Nuance comes with age. I think when I'm older I'll see too many of my takes as overly zealous and not accepting the reality of what is tangible in the 21st century. Maybe not, idk.

1334914957985673224 2020-12-05 01:38:22 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @HumbleIslandman It isn't, what I'm saying is that both sides of politics believe in political corectness, it is just one claims they don't so they can posture about how bad it is.
1334898650502352900 2020-12-05 00:33:34 +0800 <OakeRoyal> Same with "identity politics." All politics is, by definition, identity politics. People need to avoid falling down these liberal rabbit holes. Just be against things that are negative for your people and act in your own self interest.
1334894614784962562 2020-12-05 00:17:31 +0800 <OakeRoyal> The Left and Right BOTH believe in political corectness. The Right thinks that it should be politically incorrect for people to promote transgenderism. The Left thinks it should be politically incorrect to be pro-British. Your problem is not with the former, but the latter.

The guy who invented the word "gender" expermimented on a child, making him become trans at 22 months, then forcing him to perform sex acts on his twin brother.

The trauma made him commit suicide later in life. Read up on David Reimer.

The average person in 1913 had by orders of magnitude a better life than someone from 1785.

1318239483561693185 2020-10-20 01:15:59 +0800 <OakeRoyal> Loads of people online argue against democracy, but the reality is if they lived in a non democratic state as a normal member of society they would likely argue for democracy as it's in their self interest. Especially if they have political ambitions.

My only opinion on class is that class collaboration is a good thing and hierarchies are natural and to an extent necessary.

I've said on stream a few times that there are 2 council seats in my area that voted BNP, then UKIP, then voted Leave and then voted Boris. I reckon any nationalist party who can put a few people on the ground over a weekend could get those. Boom. Hard power.

I spent 2 years TRYING to escape it. Different groups have in-group preferences that clash, and it's not conducive to have that in a society.
1312075852713164802 2020-10-03 01:03:55 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @KurtenBrigade @YouKipperLad @GenteelParoxysm @HearsayTerence PA is coming along well with forming local organizations and dabbling in a bit of activism. I don't think your comment that they are focused on the Jews constantly is wholely fair, Mark has made 1 video about that topic and mentioned it once in his 400 page book.

Not sure if that will happen, though. I will say if Heritage runs down here I probably will vote for them if PA doesn't come through.

I think he has said he identifies more with his British half than with his Jamaican half. I'm afraid this attitude will spiral into "your 2% arab, therefore you can be in our movement" which is just unhelpful.

He appears to push for true conservatism and has even made noises about replacement migration. If he puts a dent in the Overton window, great. But I feel we've been let down by this UKIP guys too many times. Hope you're doing well.

1305895334397325312 2020-09-15 23:44:44 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @JohnB_ENR @FreeLionsRadio I'll ask him.
1305894526255538177 2020-09-15 23:41:32 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @JohnB_ENR @FreeLionsRadio Interested in what happened to change him from openly opposed to ethnonationalism to openly espousing it. Plus he is one of the best examples of someone that was essentially "cancelled" in lieu of a better word by "the cathedral"/political establishment so that is interesting.
1305678362841669633 2020-09-15 09:22:34 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @Daryl16519C Obviously yes
1305677407446327297 2020-09-15 09:18:46 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @Norkron Perhaps a factor, but I think a bigger reason is that people can't find "tradwives" here, so go to Asia where moral order is still somewhat intact and white people aren't hated.
1305676436569759757 2020-09-15 09:14:55 +0800 <OakeRoyal> Not trying to throw shade at anyone but I don't understand why there is a trend in the British Nationalist Movement of people picking up sticks and emigrating, mostly to East Asia. My view is this is my land and it's eternally tied to my people. England is where I'm meant to be.

Imperialism is an extension of nationalism, it's an expression of the internal desires to expand and further your group's ethnic interests. If Ireland had the prerequisites that England or Britain had, events would still have happened the other way around.

1303130781821349889 2020-09-08 08:39:24 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @LutherBurgsvik @HannaRiversM Collett told people to not address drama and cause infighting constantly and Ralph kept doing it and wouldn't take stuff down when asked. Plus he spoke on behalf of PA when he wasn't authorized to do so. You can't really have that in a political organization.
1303129410292326404 2020-09-08 08:33:57 +0800 <OakeRoyal> @HannaRiversM I remain somewhat loyal to Ralph as he was the first person to shout out our show (and did it quite a lot) and was generous with his time as the first guest. The man is however prone to causing drama and infighting which is not what you want in a political organization.

In many ways he embodied a very British spirit I think we need to revive, and he even made some noises that sound similar to ethnonationalism. But at the same time, he was a Liberal who was a key framer of the modern post-war consensus.
