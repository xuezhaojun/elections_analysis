1342633244953636865 2020-12-26 08:48:05 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> There are two FBI's. The one on the TV homicide shows whose field agents help solve crimes with their expertise. The other corrupt FBI of higher ups Comey, Strzok, Page, etc. uses power for nefarious ends. So which FBI is in Nashville?

1327300674065936385 2020-11-14 01:21:55 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> All dead people voted for Biden, none for Trump. That is statistically impossible.
1327300242706935810 2020-11-14 01:20:12 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Just a coincidence, nothing to see here. Vote counting stops simultaneously, for hours on end, in the middle of election night in the very decisive swing states where Trump was winning by sizable margins.

1326684437136994305 2020-11-12 08:33:13 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @jfmclooney @BoltingVulture Nice addition.
1326684040833994752 2020-11-12 08:31:38 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @BoltingVulture We discovered when the D/W won't start because there's no dish dry liquid, you can put in water and it runs. Magic.
1326683549219647490 2020-11-12 08:29:41 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @BoltingVulture That's funny in a funny sort of way.
1326683286593277953 2020-11-12 08:28:38 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @illdiscourse The swamp will stop at nothing to stop Trump.
1326682950331666438 2020-11-12 08:27:18 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @TanyaCornfield WE heard that straight from an elector to that Electoral College, NOT
1326682590368182272 2020-11-12 08:25:52 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @SBrewY Obama's diversity Army.
1326682065996230659 2020-11-12 08:23:47 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @StevieRenee3 @Sen_JoeManchin He and Romney should get together to cry in their beer and lemonade respectively.
1326681359130251264 2020-11-12 08:20:59 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @TanyaCornfield Sounds cool. My son's in Colorado, goes for the Dead, Phish &amp; jam bands. I'm a Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty guy so whatever.
1326680583095902209 2020-11-12 08:17:54 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @StevieRenee3 @Sen_JoeManchin Finally Manchin speaks out, but you have to wonder why some Dems are still Dems.
1326679997046812678 2020-11-12 08:15:34 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @TanyaCornfield So then he gave up Johnny Cash for rap?
1326679735330615301 2020-11-12 08:14:32 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @CindyKendrick11 The only way to fly. I remember ordering steak and fries in Paris which came out beautifully seared on the outside and raw throughout. Ate it anyway though chewy it was.
1326678493619507200 2020-11-12 08:09:36 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @RonCrowder7 @SheriHerman10 I'm obsessed by fraudulent ballots and vote counting programs. Does anyone doubt that the Dems would cheat to win?
1326677865631522818 2020-11-12 08:07:06 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @DmitriyMolla Right on, and I must say when it comes to classical music there are the immortal Germans: Bach, Beethoven &amp; Brahms. (And a host of other Europeans too.)
1326676252456005635 2020-11-12 08:00:41 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @DmitriyMolla Nice plans &amp; presentation.
1326675677282770944 2020-11-12 07:58:24 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @DmitriyMolla Fascinating, she made it through tough times in central Europe. The Axelrods lived in polyglot Bukovina where they spoke 5 languages. I feel lucky to have been born in the US with English, the language of Shakespeare. Tho not so cosmopolitan as the EU.
1326654573239554049 2020-11-12 06:34:32 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @chick4trump See us in the best light.
1326654411985326080 2020-11-12 06:33:54 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> The same folks who are sure Seth Rich was shot in a botched robbery are telling there's no evidence of vote fraud.

1326652003951513603 2020-11-12 06:24:20 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @SheriHerman10 That happens to the best people nowadays.
1326651821532852224 2020-11-12 06:23:36 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @DmitriyMolla Not a bad guess then. Moldova is a 4 hour drive from the town where my paternal grandparents emigrated from in 1904: Chernivtsi Oblast, Ukraine. (was Austria Hungary). You have a fine lineage!
1326636263710085120 2020-11-12 05:21:47 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @DmitriyMolla Your name evokes European design, is it Romanian?
1326635126822985728 2020-11-12 05:17:16 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @DmitriyMolla Right, I learned so much from Steve, and SF had firms that could run all those beautiful moldings.
1326634709733019654 2020-11-12 05:15:37 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @DmitriyMolla If you get an opening with a firm that does any thing like the design you are drawn to it's off to the races. You have the motivation!
1326633694417866762 2020-11-12 05:11:35 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @DmitriyMolla Oh dear, I didn't know Philip did that one. So where did you study?
1326633159446962178 2020-11-12 05:09:27 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @DmitriyMolla BTW Shay Zak is a genius designer. And here's the firm I was with from 1990-2000.  https://t.co/Z1ao918GKh (Steve Rynerson also a genius design, expert in Victorian restoration.BTW both Steve and Shay were tops in pencil drafting. I was good too (64-95)
1326631820469874694 2020-11-12 05:04:08 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @DmitriyMolla It's a long story how I got there. That project you posted shows talent. Would you seriously consider moving to SF if Shay (Zak) needed someone? If so I would give you my email.
1326630798624174081 2020-11-12 05:00:04 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @DmitriyMolla Ha. I knew Gropius was a boring designer way back. One of the principals of Kallman McKinnell Knowles (City Hall) was a lecturer at GSD when I started ('64). So the teachers loved it but not the public. Just looked up that firm, to find they softened up.  https://t.co/UKCVKmzN9e

1326596789290545153 2020-11-12 02:44:56 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @SheriHerman10 When the election fraud is exposed and Trump is chosen by the Electoral College, the damage to the deep state will snowball.

1326359605115490304 2020-11-11 11:02:27 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @DmitriyMolla Yes, though I was disillusioned by my experience in Cambridge. Became a drafter and worked my way up to project designer in the span of 35 years. Last position was the best:  https://t.co/KRooBMn0gw

1326009273722220545 2020-11-10 11:50:21 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @mattmfm Election is still a squeaker, nothing decisive or decided at all. And there are legal challenges, which are growing in number, that will have to be decided by SCOTUS. Enough justices may be constitutional originalists, will rule in favor of Trump and flip it.

The goal is to nullify any illegal ballots so that there can be a legal conclusion to this vote within all the states in question. Trump might win #2.

He worked as a pollster for the Democratic Party during electoral campaigns for Mike Bloomberg, and in 2016  dismissed Donald Trump's chances to beat Hillary Clinton.

The plan was that Trump would appear to win on election night but mail in votes would trickle in to give it to Biden which is happening.

1324554299188355072 2020-11-06 11:28:48 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> I thought Barr's armed men would be in Philly tonight looking over the shoulders of vote counters to make sure everything is on the up &amp; up. Because tommorrow may be too late.

1324552572225622021 2020-11-06 11:21:56 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Tonight's the night the fix comes in for Biden. But if you watched Tucker your know this can not be tolerated.  They stole this election.
1324552053914537985 2020-11-06 11:19:53 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @LibStinky Fox 'decision desk' director Chris Stirewalt has egg on his face for their way off polling predictions. He even looked like an omelet. And Arizona was pure DNC bias.

1324140946964045828 2020-11-05 08:06:17 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> You have to hand it to the Dems and their coercion strategy of allowing vandalism, rioting, looting &amp; arson to proceed uninterrupted by police intervention. Many voters probably  preferred Trump but just wanted Biden to stop the civil insurrection.
1324140520013205504 2020-11-05 08:04:35 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @123RHGreen @gatewaypundit The CIA began developing assets in the media during the 1970's with Operation Mockingbird. They never stopped and why would they not include Fox today?

1324138494516711425 2020-11-05 07:56:33 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> You have to hand it to China for helping their boy Joe with his campaign by exporting their customized virus to the Western world so their allies at WHO &amp; CDC could implement economy crushing lockdowns which put the brakes on populism.

1323989153277792259 2020-11-04 22:03:07 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> So all those blue wave polls were actually a voter suppression plot hatched by the CIA, DNC &amp; MSM.

1323381345595412480 2020-11-03 05:47:54 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @tweettruth2me Possible from neck vertebrae compression. I had that and a friend put some bee stings into my neck which fixed it.

1314044470468521989 2020-10-08 11:26:30 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @MaybeAmes @Mike_Pence Tucker says she was known as 'Sandy Cortez.'

1314042246912761856 2020-10-08 11:17:40 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @FrancesBreedlo5 @RaheemKassam His speech in Hawaii when soldiers remains were repatriated from North Korea was fantastic. I knew he had character then.
1314041189839110151 2020-10-08 11:13:28 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @assume_not Yup, that's our next President &amp; we screwed.
1314040615391424512 2020-10-08 11:11:11 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @Lynnsky_C Why is that no class partisan hack even on Fox. Just for her skin pigment?
1314040208564744193 2020-10-08 11:09:34 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Can I remind Pence and others that George Floyd took a huge dose of fentanyl with a meth booster, was resisting arrest and the knee restraint was sanctioned &amp; does not block the airway. The entire narrative is BS used by BLM to start trouble.
1314039428025905154 2020-10-08 11:06:27 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @rising_serpent The question was a Dems talking point, really stupid.
1314039099033092096 2020-10-08 11:05:09 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @TheChuck1nator @MikayesFiona Right, she was a total smirking nasty bimbo, not ready for prime time. No wonder she dropped out of the primary.
1314038739824513030 2020-10-08 11:03:43 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @MikayesFiona That disqualifies her.

1314034233791348737 2020-10-08 10:45:49 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Donna Brazile is so unlikeable that she and Kamala are two of a kind.
1314029781713932288 2020-10-08 10:28:08 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Dingbat moderator reminds us that Trump has many times said he will refuse to leave office. So Pence what will you do? she's a partisan hack, but it's not helping.
1314028923722792961 2020-10-08 10:24:43 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @JKash000 No class, as expected.
1314028730587795457 2020-10-08 10:23:57 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Moderator gave her 30 seconds and she got 3 minutes.
1314027949964881921 2020-10-08 10:20:51 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Ladies &amp; gentlemen, she brings us the 'fine people' hoax.
1314027623190802432 2020-10-08 10:19:33 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> More crap about condemning white supremacy, a phony issue.
1314027307145875458 2020-10-08 10:18:18 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Sadly Republican leaders like Pence have to say there's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. The reason was he resisted arrest in a drug induced frenzy and the fentanyl killed him.
1314026539886039041 2020-10-08 10:15:15 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> This moron said Police tortured and killed drug addict Floyd. Total lie, Officer Chauvin will be exonerated.
1314026079275945993 2020-10-08 10:13:25 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> So now we hear about nobody Breonna Taylor who stashed drugs for her boy friend.

1314023711318700033 2020-10-08 10:04:00 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @_YvonneBurton Two against one again, as will be the next debates.
1314023545048047617 2020-10-08 10:03:21 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Harris thinks its wrong to have bounties on our troops. A totally disproven meaningless talking point. Typical of this lightweight.
1314022066232930304 2020-10-08 09:57:28 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @SilvinaFlorida Not really explaining any policy just dissing Trump. Was supposed to have substance tonight. Fail.
1314021586006085632 2020-10-08 09:55:34 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> She's kicking Putin &amp; embracing Wray, bully for her.
1314020792842293253 2020-10-08 09:52:24 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> "Trump has a weird obsession with undoing Obama's legacy." Yup, that's what we voted for!
1314020071006765056 2020-10-08 09:49:32 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Harris' Senate voting record sucks. Hammer time!
1314019473448464390 2020-10-08 09:47:10 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> If any American votes Biden-Harris, they get a bimbo and a dazed old coot. They can keep that.
1314018973944606720 2020-10-08 09:45:11 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Climate change is Greta Thornberry personified or whoever she is. It's a bogus issue. Climate is always changing.
1314018453133684742 2020-10-08 09:43:07 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Harris won't talk green new deal, just fires hurricanes and tornados.
1314017770330296320 2020-10-08 09:40:24 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @Lady_Aodh I've had it with black, hispanic &amp; asian employment numbers. There's poor White folks in central Florida who need help.
1314017454050471938 2020-10-08 09:39:08 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> A perfect segue to friggin climate change? And hurricanes? This broad is moronic.
1314016953812611080 2020-10-08 09:37:09 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @OneVoiceUS Can't keep her teeth or lips together. Can't be president, too goofy.
1314015982021758976 2020-10-08 09:33:18 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @Lynnsky_C She's another democrat.
1314015128606642177 2020-10-08 09:29:54 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @SemperIdom Terrible snarky expressions non-stop
1314014883072167938 2020-10-08 09:28:55 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Harris is not answering one question. The 'moderator' is lobbing softballs and not holding her to answer.
1313990997395865604 2020-10-08 07:54:01 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @SilvinaFlorida Right, "I'm not one of your toys."
1313979086805626880 2020-10-08 07:06:41 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @SilvinaFlorida Reminded me of Leslie Gore's song: (she and I were at the same summer camp ages ago when 14 years old, and she led sing alongsüòé)  https://t.co/faHTTlTdMK
1313951211033366528 2020-10-08 05:15:55 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @jeff_gluck 'Critical race theory' is poison designed to divide the populace. Anyone who let's themselves be berated by a 'diversity trainer' is submitting to a cult fiction. BTW BLM has fomented rioting based on the fake story that police killed Floyd, who overdosed.
1313932128934137857 2020-10-08 04:00:05 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @keck553 Pathological fixation on Trump.

1313911752829136896 2020-10-08 02:39:07 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Officer Chauvin is out on Bail. Great news, he is innocent!  https://t.co/K2T02jp2gX
1313911438164066306 2020-10-08 02:37:52 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @Lady_Star_Gem Hey dingbat! Floyd died of a fentanyl overdose, its all on the latest video. Officer Chauvin acted professionally &amp; will be exonerated. BLM is the most dangerous group out there, look at the rioting.  https://t.co/K2T02jp2gX
1313890227942051843 2020-10-08 01:13:35 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @LeftyCrypto @FrantizekPaul Should also be dropped against Officer Chauvin in Minnesota. George Floyd died of fentanyl and meth poisoning.

1313828164792201220 2020-10-07 21:06:58 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Trump was elected to, build the wall, lock her up, bring back jobs and DRAIN THE SWAMP. Everything else is of lesser importance.
1313827455518605312 2020-10-07 21:04:09 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @catturd2 Barr has more important stuff to do as he stated there may be systemic injustice out there, somewhere.
1313827024553865216 2020-10-07 21:02:27 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @KatieHill4CA @AnnCoulter Hollywood is now a failing left wing propaganda machine.

1313825687153905664 2020-10-07 20:57:08 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @adamhousley @SaraCarterDC By what book? Trump supporters want lives ruined like the coup plotters did to Flynn, et al. If Biden wins it's the end.
1313824658442125315 2020-10-07 20:53:02 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @HansMahncke @paulsperry_ I remember that infuriatingly godforsaken day as if yesterday. Will someone in authority get the truth out before it gets forever buried?
1313823804301479944 2020-10-07 20:49:39 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @Thomas1774Paine It's been pointed out there's major left wing jewish involvement in all this; is there any truth to this rumor?
1313822632177995779 2020-10-07 20:44:59 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> That national security briefing at eleven today. Did the FBI find another Nascar noose? Has the DOJ identified a secret KKK militia cell? This damn well better be good. The base is sick of 'declassified' documents with the juicy bits blacked out.

1313804583442042880 2020-10-07 19:33:16 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @RealJamesWoods @HeyTammyBruce Doubts are creeping in about Michelle being a biological female.
1313803822024863744 2020-10-07 19:30:15 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @AndrewCMcCarthy @HeyTammyBruce Racial solidarity is a smoke screen, as is systemic racism &amp; 'the 1619 project.' George Floyd was not killed by Police, he died of fentanyl poisoning. Everything from BLM is a lie which suckered people in.

1311808203152338945 2020-10-02 07:20:22 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @SilvinaFlorida I know, so genteel.  Tomorrow I play with the guys. Thought you would appreciate the view of the 13th hole from the lanai. (Lake Haines in the background, Polk County, FL)  https://t.co/G2WBx7rbwB
1311805565480439809 2020-10-02 07:09:53 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @Lisette09280142 @WakeUpCanada1 I had a girlfriend in New York City who was adopted &amp; she learned she was born in East Chester. So we made a pilgrimage there (in 1970). Fascinating trip then, no mosques of course. My guess is still Canadian old stock, but can't be sure, right?
1311803629700100097 2020-10-02 07:02:12 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @SilvinaFlorida Great ad copy, I like the part about 'an afternoon of golf.'

1311745453000667138 2020-10-02 03:11:01 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @j_gelling He will shine next time by letting Biden go on and on.

1311151011063529472 2020-09-30 11:48:55 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @marewest Biden had a simple answer for every question, "I won't answer that" then he denounces Trump.

1311149251251122176 2020-09-30 11:41:56 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @CAGL_1 @JesseKellyDC Biden was an incoherent trash talker.

1311148902276571136 2020-09-30 11:40:32 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @nikonchick That hot mess had Wallace sweaty looking and shaken.
1311148534322933763 2020-09-30 11:39:05 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @DeAnna4Congress Dana Perinio said Biden got over the low bar set for him and others are saying a version of that. But who set a low bar for Joe and why? The bar has to be high for both and Biden totally took gas tonight.
1311147601367109632 2020-09-30 11:35:22 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @SeattleIndpdnt Who want a divorce, now what? lawyers?
1311146360134160389 2020-09-30 11:30:26 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Wallace was a good Democrat all the way: he wanted Trump to call off the Proud Boys, brought up the fine people hoax, brought up the 750 bucks, demanded Trump believe climate change, believe white supremacy training, etc. We know where Wallace stands!
1311137508282036224 2020-09-30 10:55:16 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @illdiscourse Ugly moderator.

1311135943252996096 2020-09-30 10:49:03 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> WTF? Biden had a binder on the podium, he was reading notes the whole time. An aide picked it up after the debate.
1311133175519862785 2020-09-30 10:38:03 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @BretBaier Not Wallace, very weak.
1311132995437441025 2020-09-30 10:37:20 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @BretBaier Wallace lost.
1311132866156298240 2020-09-30 10:36:49 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Joe is speaking in platitudes nonstop, the most boring uninspiring speaker ever.

1311132421476298752 2020-09-30 10:35:03 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Wallace is worried Justice Barrett would settle the election. What a total hack he is.
1311130545833881600 2020-09-30 10:27:36 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @BrianFinch38 It's old, all his material tonight is old.
1311130431237087238 2020-09-30 10:27:09 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Wallace says he's having trouble following all this, Biden sure is too.
1311128922717859840 2020-09-30 10:21:09 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @JoeDanMedia @_YvonneBurton Wallace is a disgrace to Fox tonight.
1311128779104890882 2020-09-30 10:20:35 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @FrancesBreedlo5 Why would a Hillary voter do such a thing?
1311128531385057288 2020-09-30 10:19:36 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Wallace wants to know if Trump believes in climate change. Dumfuk question, climate is always changing.
1311127988860325891 2020-09-30 10:17:26 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> My son....had a drug problem! (Biden)
1311127849420697603 2020-09-30 10:16:53 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Wallace can't hide his bias, he's been exposed.
1311127715748220928 2020-09-30 10:16:21 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> 'He's Putin's puppy' says Biden
1311126962442768386 2020-09-30 10:13:22 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Wallace just wanted to give Biden a polite boost, and now this shit show.
1311126812932616193 2020-09-30 10:12:46 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @leighgoodison He's lost control, statesmanship out the window.
1311126614034591749 2020-09-30 10:11:58 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Biden has crib notes.
1311124860412874752 2020-09-30 10:05:00 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Wallace chose humbug topics.
1311124672738734082 2020-09-30 10:04:16 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Biden not good with words.
1311124495181193231 2020-09-30 10:03:33 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Wallace like critical race training, thank you very much.
1311123068434157575 2020-09-30 09:57:53 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Race relations is the dopiest topic of all. Just an excuse for Biden to talk about Charlottesville.
1311121257618968580 2020-09-30 09:50:41 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @SharylAttkisson Biden is only partially coherent, mostly mud slinging.
1311120840109551622 2020-09-30 09:49:02 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Biden looks at the camera and talks to the people. I dunno bout that.
1311118558701793280 2020-09-30 09:39:58 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Whats Biden reading?
1311118423502606338 2020-09-30 09:39:26 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @LeslieMarshall @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Yes
1311118267361222656 2020-09-30 09:38:48 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Wallace asked Trump about the ecomedy which says a lot. Wallace is flustered.
1311117242713755648 2020-09-30 09:34:44 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Biden says Trump sits on his golf course.....ooh
1311116957773688832 2020-09-30 09:33:36 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Biden never answers Wallace questions.
1311114752597413898 2020-09-30 09:24:51 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Joe didn't say about his covid plan.
1311112540223668224 2020-09-30 09:16:03 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Wallace is debating Trump.

1310949875278909441 2020-09-29 22:29:41 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Race relations were good until BLM used the overdose death of George Floyd to drum up the false charge of 'police brutality,' setting off nationwide rioting and assaults against White people. All this was planned long ago awaiting a pretext.
1310948063821824007 2020-09-29 22:22:29 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @larryelder @RealCandaceO Same with George Floyd, who ingested a fatal dose of fentanyl which caused his lungs to fill with fluid. That's why he said 'I can't breathe' 15 times, standing, sitting and horizontal. Only Tucker Carlson has the guts to say that Officer Floyd isn' a killer.
1310947069448904704 2020-09-29 22:18:32 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @RealCandaceO @SHAQ Barkley &amp; Shaq are deluded, as most black men are, in assuming police killed Floyd. In reality his own bad behavior caused his death. He ingested a fatal dose of fentanyl and resisted  arrest. That neck restraint doesn't block the airway.

The objective is total control of the population by dividing us along racial lines &amp; instituting a 'social credit' score; all this to obscure wealth inequality.

1308751397349924872 2020-09-23 20:53:43 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> In a Dem-crat city they have to call out the National Guard when a jury is reaching a verdict in a trial whose outcome might trigger the local agitators.  So when will FOX quit referring to subversive rioters as 'demonstrators' or 'protesters'?

He's #1 in the nation.

1304237766927175680 2020-09-11 09:58:09 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @DazzyDi @cabinetdoorgirl Will find it. I love it when he takes off his glasses, puts them down stares into the camera, points his finger at us and goes wild.

1304203161742303232 2020-09-11 07:40:39 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @JNewcomer5 @douglasmercer33 Good advice, cops should walk! Luckily we live in small town Central Florida, where the peace is kept by a real lawman, Sheriff Grady Judd.

Are you on something?... because you're acting real erratic" Floyd:" No, nothing.  Chauvin later: "He's got to be on something.

1304114075245346816 2020-09-11 01:46:39 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @tribelaw Folks move from cities to escape the carnage there, the poverty stricken ghettos, the blight, the density. What's that got to do with Trump avoiding panicky rhetoric? But I know why you, sir, are panicking. Your leftist agenda will be stopped in November.
1304097716054765569 2020-09-11 00:41:39 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @marangwe @douglasmercer33 Many conservatives  are unwilling to go against the mainstream narrative by which BLM has them over the barrel of political correctness. Too bad, since everything BLM is a destructive lie, oddly embraced by big Tech &amp; most corporations.
1304082250368274433 2020-09-10 23:40:11 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Tucker had this to say about 'critical race theory:' "It's a bad idea &amp; like all bad ideas it came out of Academia." Add to that 'gender &amp; sexuality theory, part of the attempt to replace traditional values, which the Obama years greatly advanced.
1304046556979621888 2020-09-10 21:18:21 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> So he is not a sharp tack?

1304043324328861696 2020-09-10 21:05:31 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Still waiting for Hannity &amp; Judge Jeanine to apologize for convicting Officer Chauvin of a 'racist' murder. The man is unjustly languishing in jail for a crime he did not commit while rioters are bailed out pronto by left wing lawyers.  Free Derek Chauvin!
1304042102490312704 2020-09-10 21:00:39 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Conservative guys, Deroy Murdoch &amp; Ben Carson, reacted irrationally to the death of G. Floyd. They wanted to make 'Juneteenth' a national holiday right away, assuming it was a racist murder. Video &amp; transcript evidence shows that was not the case.
1303989259297226753 2020-09-10 17:30:41 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @douglasmercer33 Many thanks for this, I wondered about the full transcript! Officer Chauvin's only error was keeping Floyd horizontal, which is the worst thing to do during opiate overdose. But he's a cop, not a medic. Transcript needs to get out there more.

Also obvious that Officer Chauvin did not murder Floyd. The neck restraint didn't block the airways, his lungs filled with fluid.

I was surprised to see Nat'l Guardsmen kneeling with protesters after the George Floyd hoax blew up the country. (New bodycam showed it was a drug OD, not murder)

1303528954645676034 2020-09-09 11:01:35 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> @MattWalshBlog Not actual sailboats but maybe the feeling of being adrift at sea out of touch with the world. Artists get to say anything about anything. If you have a real job you don't get to do that. Because I was an Art major way back when.

1303004043820830720 2020-09-08 00:15:47 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Barr seems to be a good man, but he lacks the fire that Comey, Weissman, Strzok and all the hacks on the other side have. They were able to get indictments, show trials, convictions and prison sentences in record time. Yet Durham has charged but one.

1302769142706114560 2020-09-07 08:42:22 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Barr on Levin TV: 'We will indict people only when we are certain a crime has been committed and can prove this beyond a reasonable doubt.' Man oh man a fiercely motivated lawman has just laid down the gauntlet.....yawn.

1302765923401715713 2020-09-07 08:29:35 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Ag Barr said 'black lives matter &amp; all lives matter.'  'There are some problems with policing' without giving an example. 'Systemic racism exists in this country because black schools are failing.' Kind of a nothing burger so far.
1302763092393308161 2020-09-07 08:18:20 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Bill Barr is on with Levin now being evasive to the question 'is the DOJ looking into Antifa's funding and organization? He said they get money off the internet &amp; they hijack lawful demonstrations. Surprisingly weak &amp; nonchalant.

1300985805754847232 2020-09-02 10:36:01 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> In 2012 Obama issued an executive order that mandated 'diversity training' through the Federal Government. This indoctrination into 'critical race theory' has gone as far as the FBI and Sandia National Lab. President Trump can undo all this by order too.
1300984253530939394 2020-09-02 10:29:51 +0800 <LHAxelrod1> Tucker's opening was about how an idea called 'critical race theory' has inserted itself throughout the US Government in the form of mandated 'diversity training'- directed against whites only. You learn about 'white privilege' and have to write confessions.
