I was a QA Director then a Launch Director but neither titles describe it as these are just end of process for most people. We can chat.

1313147733960785925 2020-10-06 00:03:11 +0800 <JoeGSwe> @lfcxtn Who is the next captain? You could see moving from Gerrard and Carragher to Henderson and Milner but what‚Äôs after that? VVD?
1313144345332195328 2020-10-05 23:49:43 +0800 <JoeGSwe> @SkyNews Is that to get more people in to a small space? Surely they should be doing the opposite?

1313084758910554117 2020-10-05 19:52:57 +0800 <JoeGSwe> @DevRelCallum You can calculate the ‚Äúknock on rate‚Äù by measuring new issues introduced in a game area after someone worked on that area - QA science

1312344539433238528 2020-10-03 18:51:35 +0800 <JoeGSwe> @AntonHand All the money, all the hype, the big name franchise and hordes of developers. Hasn‚Äôt changed there then. EA is not what it was in the 90s and early 2000s.
1312339536752652290 2020-10-03 18:31:42 +0800 <JoeGSwe> @Mitsuo_Hirakawa I recall a drunken conversation with you where you told me your name was Shining Hero.
1312050141940125697 2020-10-02 23:21:45 +0800 <JoeGSwe> @Byronwww123 üòÇ
1312011960997814278 2020-10-02 20:50:02 +0800 <JoeGSwe> So yes, bad management and planning are a cause. But the whole market strategy of gaming is the true root
1312011323266473984 2020-10-02 20:47:30 +0800 <JoeGSwe> Though downloading a 20gb when you first insert a disc is something that also causes concern. As we move to more and more digital delivery the need to crunch should be less and less, but there will always be those who want their shiny limited edition on day 1
1312011321756577793 2020-10-02 20:47:29 +0800 <JoeGSwe> All of this leads to a very fine balance in delivery, making it quite scientific with prediction models around how teams perform that seem at odds with the whole creative process. To mitigate many of these issues a lot of publishers lean heavily on day 1 patches
1312011320280129536 2020-10-02 20:47:29 +0800 <JoeGSwe> This sometimes happens years in advance, before a title is announced. Pre-orders give an idea of demand which will affect the size of the manufacturing block you need. Reaction from the public will lead to a tweak in features which could lead to feature creep or even feature cut
1312011318787014656 2020-10-02 20:47:29 +0800 <JoeGSwe> There is competition in the backend for access to produce these items, especially to get things out in time for holiday seasons. Publishers often block book manufacturing times and then slot a game into that time once they know how it is progressing.
1312011317398704128 2020-10-02 20:47:28 +0800 <JoeGSwe> There is a finite amount of manufacturing space for discs, packs etc. Gaming shares this with other spaces such as Movies and Music (Blueray, DVD and CD production and packing).
1312011315729268737 2020-10-02 20:47:28 +0800 <JoeGSwe> For note: I specialize in Launch, Project Planning and Quality Assurance and have shipped 100+ products over a 20+ year career. So here goes: Most games still provide some sort of physical media, and this is what causes the core problem. Why cant dates move?
1312011314240380929 2020-10-02 20:47:27 +0800 <JoeGSwe> I see that #Crunch in #Gaming is trending again with a lot of people talking about bad planning and bad management. Whilst both of those do have an effect it is important to understand how this area of gaming works, as its far from ‚ÄúCreative‚Äù.

There are enough true social manipulations like Facebook going on, but Health professionals wouldn't take part in something like this.

1311065267930308609 2020-09-30 06:08:12 +0800 <JoeGSwe> @jtoresson Good article. Sums up my frustration. After 25 years mainly at EA and Sony I know what I want from a publisher. It feels like I have to take this big package from them when what i really need is cash. Investors say get a publisher first so I go around in circles looking for a fit

1310639857253986304 2020-09-29 01:57:47 +0800 <JoeGSwe> @Shatners_Ghost @parrotttd It‚Äôs supposed to give command of those who wear the other rings. You know what they think and can manipulate them. It‚Äôs also supposed to make lesser races(orcs and goblins) be easier for you to control.
1310496277898113024 2020-09-28 16:27:15 +0800 <JoeGSwe> @Alfie_Agius @PeterStefanovi2 Probably right after they realize that these people serve, not rule, as they are elected to positions by the people to whom they remain accountable- not themselves or business
1309840364086362117 2020-09-26 21:00:53 +0800 <JoeGSwe> @SkyNews How did they launch a product that didn‚Äôt do what it was designed to do?

1308898791622402049 2020-09-24 06:39:24 +0800 <JoeGSwe> @AntonHand I recall shipping a few games with multiple exe files to help with memory issues. Especially swapping from Single to Multiplayer. No one really noticed (was very evident on MoH 2010)
1308853130608738304 2020-09-24 03:37:58 +0800 <JoeGSwe> @AntonHand It says they‚Äôve finally fixed the UI. At last, it was almost Skyrim bad
