1327408696834486272 2020-11-14 08:31:10 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @MZHemingway I think Rich Grenelle said the Liz Sly story was false.
1327401192830320641 2020-11-14 08:01:20 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @janciiiii @mcuban @senatemajldr @SpeakerPelosi Thanks for your message. My understanding is that Nancy Pelosi would not do a separate bill to authorize strictly relief payments to Americans. My understanding is also that that option was available from the Republicans. it is a shame that Americans are suffering.
1327394983838576640 2020-11-14 07:36:40 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @TeamCavuto @SenGillibrand The senator is not a prophet &amp; talking about stopping the economy again she‚Äôs very very wrong.
1327301660826189824 2020-11-14 01:25:50 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @LizSly Treachery by people who know better.
1327283287182635009 2020-11-14 00:12:50 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> So @CNN you go along with @camanpour? We never saw anything like her film portrays during all of President Trump‚Äôs administration except as practiced by the left. Have you denounced BLM and antifa? Biden and Harris would not. Harris encouraged paying bail for the looters.
1327281744542724096 2020-11-14 00:06:42 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @janciiiii @mcuban @senatemajldr All Nancy Pelosi would have to have done was agree to a relief bill that just covered relief payments to Americans. She wouldn‚Äôt do it. It is a shame that the American people have been put in the middle of a politicized pandemic by our ‚Äúrepresentatives‚Äù.
1327281051312406528 2020-11-14 00:03:56 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @camanpour It is offensive that you would compare Donald Trump‚Äòs administration with Nazis. I know you‚Äôre much smarter than that, so I really don‚Äôt understand why you would do it. The glass breaking, burning and killing were done by the left to purposefully harm Americans.
1327278029589004290 2020-11-13 23:51:56 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @mcuban The problem is Nancy Pelosi, who who could‚Äôve provided relief for people months ago, and has not. I hope you see that Covid has become politicized well Americans are suffering. #COVID19
1327055287837020162 2020-11-13 09:06:50 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> We have been patient for two weeks times many more 2 weeks. It‚Äôs a virus. Why don‚Äôt you be honest with people?

1318432700206702592 2020-10-20 14:03:45 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> I should have said Joe Biden was alleged to have assaulted intern.
1318411925634441216 2020-10-20 12:41:12 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> Joe Biden is saying to the American people that they don‚Äôt deserve to know anything about his campaign.
1318411576341221376 2020-10-20 12:39:49 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @Apostate1123 @ggreenwald @AdamSchiff Everything he said about Donald Trump turned out to be untrue.
1318410142124187649 2020-10-20 12:34:07 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> The fact that the ‚Äúexperts‚Äú can‚Äôt come to a consensus is an indication that they as group cannot tell the truth, and we really don‚Äôt have a pandemic of serious consequence. If they really cared, they wouldn‚Äôt jeopardize Americans.
1318409491268816896 2020-10-20 12:31:32 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> I think Mr. Roberts you have cheap and the vote. #SCOTUS
1318406890947145728 2020-10-20 12:21:12 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> Why hasn‚Äôt it mattered to you for at least the last four years? Many people with conservative opinions have been routinely shut down by Twitter and Facebook. Why didn‚Äôt you care then?
1318404969553293314 2020-10-20 12:13:34 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> Anyone can I ask what flavor milkshake you bought.
1318394932130766848 2020-10-20 11:33:41 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> The GOP is using a legitimate process to select a supreme court judge. And, it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs an opening.
1318388023772377088 2020-10-20 11:06:13 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> I am disappointed that the world now teaches that there is no God, and therefore, we are not his children. However, when you pray you find out otherwise ‚Äì he does live and you are his child.
1318386566738276353 2020-10-20 11:00:26 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @libbytard @JackBlaine3 Family is too important to cut ties for politics.
1318385936724447232 2020-10-20 10:57:56 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @revwadegriffith @ak111961 Joe Biden supported segregation. He created law in Senate that has put ton of black petty criminals in jail for  long time. He assaulted one of his interns. allowed his son to use second highest position in the land to obtain money &amp;  influence. Will Raise taxes. Vote @POTUS 2020
1318383958019645442 2020-10-20 10:50:04 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> Don‚Äôt you think that if a ballot cannot be validated, it should not count John Roberts? #SCOTUSPA

1318355325309734918 2020-10-20 08:56:18 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> So, why wouldn‚Äôt the Biden campaign engage with ice cube? Wouldn‚Äôt that have been a benefit to Black people?
1318353215704891392 2020-10-20 08:47:55 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> Joe Biden will increase your taxes. He is not a nice guy.  #VoteTrump2020

1318331437381136386 2020-10-20 07:21:22 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> I think this is race baiting.
1318321861407645696 2020-10-20 06:43:19 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> But, he would say, you have no right to see me work every day until you elect me.
1318314676824854528 2020-10-20 06:14:46 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> I was glad to be in Hires downtown today- great service and food as usual! #hiressaltlake
1318314443550306304 2020-10-20 06:13:51 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> I would think a candidate for President would want to answer questions.  I‚Äôm voting for @POTUS
1318302575561560065 2020-10-20 05:26:41 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> Ever since #Covid 19 started, the @POTUS administration has been working for a vaccine. Why are Harris Biden trying to make people afraid of it?
1317701613465739266 2020-10-18 13:38:41 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> Joe Biden is not condemning this violence.
1317697657750482944 2020-10-18 13:22:57 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @DavidAFrench Why don‚Äôt you go after Gavin Newsom for his abuse of Californians?  and Governor Whitmer‚Äòs abuse of Michiganders
1317696728456257538 2020-10-18 13:19:16 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> That‚Äôs not true at all.
1317693692287741952 2020-10-18 13:07:12 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @darrenforutah Improve Utah first. Education money spent unequally depending on where someone lives.
1317692528058040321 2020-10-18 13:02:34 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> Your paper tells an amazing story. I could not have believed that a person could be sentenced to so much time in jail for demanding his right to go to trial. Just not right.
1317682234061582337 2020-10-18 12:21:40 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> An abuser who used the law as a bludgeon speaks.
1317655984584544261 2020-10-18 10:37:22 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> Why didn‚Äôt someone protect him?
1317614567719989249 2020-10-18 07:52:47 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @realDonaldTrump knew what was needed to revive the economy &amp; he did it. Donald Trump cares about America and you didn‚Äôt. You purposefully weakened it.
1317614560208068608 2020-10-18 07:52:45 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> This is a terrible statement and untrue. The US had the best economy until Chinese virus. And it is roaring back! But you left the president and the United States a stagnant one that you had rigged to never really revive. Even Barack thought a magic wand was needed, but ...
1317491669239934979 2020-10-17 23:44:26 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> If Joe Biden were for the Second Amendment he wouldn‚Äôt want to ban any kind of rifle or handgun. And more importantly, he would want to make sure that I had the ability to properly protect my life.
1317490545124540416 2020-10-17 23:39:58 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @JohnStossel @realDonaldTrump lower taxes, 2A, law &amp; order, my personal liberty, energy independence, less war.
1317294313051545600 2020-10-17 10:40:13 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @JoeBiden has not condemned those that take your food at a restaurant, eat it &amp; throw it back at you. He has not condemned violent rioters who have destroyed your business, beaten you &amp; killed you. Trump stands with all of us.
1317284798172295170 2020-10-17 10:02:24 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @Twitter, really?

1317256959599333376 2020-10-17 08:11:47 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> Paying higher taxes as Joe Biden would force us to do, would give us less money to use as we deem most appropriate. #VoteTrump2020

1317246597793607680 2020-10-17 07:30:36 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> The Congress could easily do both things. @SpeakerPelosi won‚Äôt negotiate. Right?

1317221441155211264 2020-10-17 05:50:39 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> Don‚Äôt know why people listened to one or the other. But I know the Biden meeting was much easier to listen to because he was given an opportunity to tell his story. NBC Townhall was a model of contention brought on by the moderator, who didn‚Äôt make it very comfortable for people
1317217805557641216 2020-10-17 05:36:12 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @unseen1_unseen Today Romney is upset that he didn‚Äôt denounce Q anon

1316990318969909249 2020-10-16 14:32:15 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @GStephanopoulos you did not serve America well today by giving Biden such easy questions, particularly with the corrupt relationship he and his family have had with China and the Ukraine.
1316989975519318016 2020-10-16 14:30:53 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> Why @EvanMcMullin are you trying to steer LDS people ‚ÄúMormons‚Äú away from voting for Donald Trump. I question that you love the United States of America, if you think Joe Biden would respect our liberty. You remind me of Nephite dissenters in the book of Mormon.
1316988714929680386 2020-10-16 14:25:52 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> Facebook and Twitter are hiding Joe Biden‚Äòs corruption from you. They are hoping you won‚Äôt find out about it because Biden has allowed his family to benefit and receive money from China and the Ukraine and the mayor of Moscow‚Äôs wife.

1316040090301341701 2020-10-13 23:36:23 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @MittRomney Don‚Äôt just talk about tone of voice. Encourage the American people to hold up, revere the US Constitution and follow it. It‚Äôs for all of us to see how we measure up to it. This election is about personal liberty. Will we as citizens demand it Or let others control us even more.
1316039082762362881 2020-10-13 23:32:22 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @MittRomney Your statement deals with appearances, but does not get to some of the real issues for people. But, I know this, you cannot have one side demand that the president condemn white extremism, and at the same time condone the violence of the left.
1316037552046968835 2020-10-13 23:26:17 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @MittRomney promised by A Biden administration. You don‚Äôt talk about the politicization of COVID-19. You do not talk about the very real side effects of COVID-19 like suicide &amp; drug abuse and the destruction of an economy. Nor, the attacks on a supreme court nominee for her religion.
1316035836714991616 2020-10-13 23:19:28 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @MittRomney Your statement does nothing to address false impeachment of the president, and attack at the highest levels of government meaning it‚Äôs police and intelligence functions on the presidency of the United States. You don‚Äôt address the further attacks on the second amendment ...
1316034959891546112 2020-10-13 23:15:59 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @MittRomney You  have a media that is hiding information from the American people, so that in the end good decisions may not be made. The medias bias and partisanship are the real election interference in America. Your &amp; Congress continue to allow the censorship of conservatives.
1316033826104045568 2020-10-13 23:11:29 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @MittRomney There are Democrat leaders allowing their cities to be destroyed. Neither property nor life are valuable to some, and yet you have Kamala Harris and Joe Biden who will not condemn the violence of the left, and Harris even asks citizens to bail violent leftists out.
1316032829650685953 2020-10-13 23:07:31 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @MittRomney It is a shame that Democrats and Republicans - politicians have not done the work over the years they said they would do. Both liberals and conservatives agree to spend same amount of money, leading, in the end, to little or no difference between them.

1313572580763164672 2020-10-07 04:11:22 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @realDonaldTrump after calling off the stimulus talks the market sank. Keep negotiating, Americans need the help.

1311141640652771328 2020-09-30 11:11:41 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> President Trump is not responsible for coronavirus deaths. He sent hospital ships he built hospitals he got ventilators to hospitals.

1309971671491645440 2020-09-27 05:42:39 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @ewarren This is absolutely outrageous. #votetrumppence2020
1309968725488013314 2020-09-27 05:30:56 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @TempestCounsel Certainly. But, you wouldn‚Äôt lead them from God. Good luck in your work.
1309946584881270784 2020-09-27 04:02:58 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @TempestCounsel I am addressing your comments from the viewpoint of a person seeking counseling. Your first text talks about toxic religion, a term I admit, I don‚Äôt readily understand. My experience with religion has been very good. My experience w/God has been very good  No need to separate.

1309888717637578758 2020-09-27 00:13:01 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @TempestCounsel The should work together.
1309715185041436672 2020-09-26 12:43:28 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> God requires us to protect our families &amp; our own lives even to shedding blood. He made us free, and not to be subject to the violent. #freedom
1309684869518123008 2020-09-26 10:43:00 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> Faith is as effectual as facts. Faith builds hope and confidence and love in those that possess it. Faith leads people to greater accomplishments than they might have thought possible on their own. No favors are done to the person that eliminates faith in their life.
1309584359154880512 2020-09-26 04:03:36 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @JoeBiden must not get the questions to the debate ahead of time. @realDonaldTrump
1309576904928718849 2020-09-26 03:33:59 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> No person should have to tolerate #BLM interrupting their dinner. no person should have to tolerate BLM blocking their vehicle in traffic and damaging it.  no person should be targeted, beaten, and shot by BLM. Get BLM under control.
1309567895685324800 2020-09-26 02:58:11 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @PricerMad @ldsknack @JosephNSanberg The WSJ article title asked if we should forgive all student debt. It‚Äôs interesting that word we used. because to forgive all of the debt would put the burden on taxpayers. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to tax others to pay off a student‚Äôs debt. There is no endless supply money
1309566729463365632 2020-09-26 02:53:33 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @PricerMad @ldsknack @JosephNSanberg Seems to me that the people who have the debt and our economy are best served by paying it off. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever been good financially for the groups that make loans to have to write them off. I still think it‚Äôs necessary for people to learn to pay their debts.
1309367639605538817 2020-09-25 13:42:26 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> There‚Äôs no excuse for the violence being carried out on American streets. There‚Äôs no excuse for the mistreatment of anyone.

1306717518107607040 2020-09-18 06:11:48 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @EricRWeinstein Peoples hearts determine whether or not violence will be needed. There are violent and evil people. Until we change our hearts, there will always be violence and evil.
1306716936848289792 2020-09-18 06:09:30 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> @EricRWeinstein It seems this thinking has led to the defunding police movement. I am in favor of more and more training of police to make them better and better at relating to and dealing with people. But sometimes, violence is the only answer.

1302504093936566272 2020-09-06 15:09:10 +0800 <ChipSpencer1> This is terrible statement by @KamalaHarris about not trusting vaccine during @realDonaldTrump admin. People are depending on vaccine to feel normal. She is trying to increase fear. And she implies President would try to kill people. She is not a leader. #VoteTrump2020
