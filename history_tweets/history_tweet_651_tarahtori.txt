There are only 2 parties in America.  Rats or Republicans. Independents serve to siphon votes.  The forefathers suggested ONE party and work out differences.

A mere 100 years ago this was a world full of people what participated in physical labor since the beginning of time until the modern era.

There may be worse or others in the past but she is IT for me.
1341553575261065216 2020-12-23 09:17:51 +0800 <tarahtori> @jabnolimit @realDonaldTrump he made the announcement, they have to try harder.  lol  he's not signing it

Right?  People have strengths and weaknesses.

1341543729396629504 2020-12-23 08:38:44 +0800 <tarahtori> @EaglesWinItAll @JackPosobiec equality is the only way?  In what manner are you speaking? Are we all equally as smart, honest, caring, pro America?  Or do you mean equally held at the same position at work forever with no chance to shine, no chance to be a leader or own your own business?

1340026489232904193 2020-12-19 04:09:46 +0800 <tarahtori> @Bran_American Hence the overblown "death count", masks even though they don't work and banning social gathering places.  All documented in the plan for the Color Revolution.  It's all in there.

1339734587891740674 2020-12-18 08:49:51 +0800 <tarahtori> It’s imperative to our survival that across the Nation all GOP leaders stand behind the Forensic Audit of all suspect machines.  We must sort the illegal paper ballots and drive out unlawful acts of physical exclusion at the polls!

I don't think it would ever be a good idea but I will not tolerate being physically attacked and to go through "re-education" nor have my children taught Marxism in school.  That's where I draw the line.  Some schools already teach it.

I've seen what I believe to be evidence, I've heard accounts what I believe are actions that clearly point to something being hidden yet our point has been shot down at every turn.  If there are other options...someone "IN AUTHORITY" please share!😅
1337567813733675008 2020-12-12 09:19:52 +0800 <tarahtori> @1Latinos4Trump Should it turn into a "who can the cheat the best" contest?  OMLord....this would be funny if wasn't so un-funny.  You know, I'm mad...all these people saying, "take a deep breath..blah blah blah"  OK, I'll consider that after I let out my frustration of the past 5 years!  TVM 😅
1337565446220996614 2020-12-12 09:10:27 +0800 <tarahtori> @EBergstrom75 Thanks for belittling everyone who has been on edge for 9 months with babies to worry about, jobs they've lost, credit ratings going in the toilet and bills continue to be paid.  Some of us are not very rational right now.

1337435443659497478 2020-12-12 00:33:52 +0800 <tarahtori> Is the "evidence" just fluff? Is this another scam like the "Russia Hoax?" I have more questions than answers at this point.

1337275779466612738 2020-12-11 13:59:25 +0800 <tarahtori> You re spot on.  The Left are rabid haters that would, if the truth be told, love to see Donald J. Trump dead.  They have no real basis for it and it's consumed their lives.  It's sad and pathetic but, a problem.  How do you talk to people who are out of touch?

I wouldn't trade a single moment but, I didn't always walk in the light.  To quote someone I respect, "...we live and learn and redeem."  Thanks for your candor.

Maybe instead of the rapture into heaven this is the decent into hell leaving the people who love God, believe in Jesus, honor them both as best as sinners are able and move forward in the "purged" world.  One can dream....

1327126641022291970 2020-11-13 13:50:22 +0800 <tarahtori> This is the ALCJ website voter fraud hotline list for all 50 states.  I will pin it to my profile if anyone needs it.   https://t.co/MqVdHMl7OR
1327126043157782528 2020-11-13 13:48:00 +0800 <tarahtori> @JamieeS17 @mickolambo That was really weird, how does someone disappear?  I saw another file on twitter that was recorded on someone's phone.  It was CBSN and the guy's eyes went from very dark brown or black to some odd looking reptilian greenish color right on the screen.  Very creepy stuff
1327124757817532416 2020-11-13 13:42:53 +0800 <tarahtori> @aubrey_huff @A_Comfy_Chair I believe you! I'm a Texan born and raised but spent a lot of time in California.  I really like the state a lot.  I have longed for it to be Red so when I saw the energy and excitement for Trump I was thrilled.  All States should be audited
1327124293860405248 2020-11-13 13:41:03 +0800 <tarahtori> @Calloutfortruth To clarify:  If in fact there is an abundance of fraud, which I believe there is, and the court cannot make a decision....that's when it goes to the House.  it's in the constitution and it's the 12th Amendment
1327122772498198529 2020-11-13 13:35:00 +0800 <tarahtori> @catturd2 @BlueSkyNJ2 I had to read that a couple of times....I get you.
1327120623664050176 2020-11-13 13:26:28 +0800 <tarahtori> @Calloutfortruth I believe we have time...but the other option we have is that if the court cannot make a determination the election is null and void.  Choosing the President then goes to the House of Rep.  Each state gets one vote per state = 50 states and there are 37 Republican states! Bonus!

1327114589629198336 2020-11-13 13:02:29 +0800 <tarahtori> @HBwriterMike @LilyGraceSABY It started back in the 90's I remember Anarchy being a thing at our local Jr. High but I thought it was cute, like a joke.  Kids never want rules, that's a given.  No one wants to hear this but we have failed our unwed mothers by having no programs to provide meaningful help!

1327110854232465409 2020-11-13 12:47:38 +0800 <tarahtori> @Calloutfortruth This Dominion Software scandal is the real deal.  The Left gets busted.  Trump gets 4 More Years.

There hasn't been a Presidential Candidate to Win FLORIDA and NOT proceed to win the Election since 1992 when George HW Bush lost to Clinton.  Before that was 1960 when Nixon lost to JFK.

Ask them why they don’t report it. Give your question to them until they block you. I started doing that today.

1320840050138034176 2020-10-27 05:29:42 +0800 <tarahtori> @exponaeus I once just thought, "It doesn't matter, anyone can be who they think they are or who they think they should be."  Then they started punishing people who don't buy into their theory.  And the Left says were a "Cult"  HA!
1320839433558609922 2020-10-27 05:27:15 +0800 <tarahtori> @OD_ant @MarieTerese10 Agree, and the fact that I'm the Chumpiest Chump of the Trump Chump Chumps...is reason to follow me!  No matter my skin tone!

1320827308815601664 2020-10-27 04:39:04 +0800 <tarahtori> I have to have time to process this information.  Is this common knowledge?  Am I the only one who didn't know this information?  Obviously not because the Left is losing their minds over the Death toll and THERE is NO WAY of knowing how many actually died of Covid-19!

Legalized murder is far more costly than any other expense. How can a people who do not respect unborn life first passionately promote respect for life at all?

1314771065378398209 2020-10-10 11:33:43 +0800 <tarahtori> @cdinicol I just wanted the free shipping.  My nephew has had an Amazon account since they started and all the services are free with his subscription!  I'm too afraid to ask if he's cancelled because I don't want to hear the answer.  : (
1314763385834295296 2020-10-10 11:03:12 +0800 <tarahtori> This is the Pizza Shop President Trump mentioned.  BLM has harassed them into cancelling an event for a Republican Candidate!  #freedom    https://t.co/rd895vNlU1
1314760470805573633 2020-10-10 10:51:37 +0800 <tarahtori> @cdinicol I think when you sign up it's called Amazon Prime and the video service comes with it.
1314758688511590401 2020-10-10 10:44:33 +0800 <tarahtori> Guys, we really have to boycott the liberal companies that support the Left with billions.

1314749944813809665 2020-10-10 10:09:48 +0800 <tarahtori> @RevPatriot17 @HembG @MajorPatriot Sidney Powell said at a Speaking engagement at Hillsdale College that Seasoned NY Detectives had to excuse themselves to puke at what they saw on the Lappy.  I really get a nausea/chill when I think of what she said.  People need to be "hung"  seriously.
1314748023185051649 2020-10-10 10:02:10 +0800 <tarahtori> @RevPatriot17 @HembG @MajorPatriot The laptop owner was released to a "halfway house" in May of 2017 and we haven't heard a peep out of him.  I believe he's working with the team of investigators.  If I know Trump, there's a bombshell coming.  If no bombshell I'll be devastated.

1314632240807239681 2020-10-10 02:22:05 +0800 <tarahtori> now we see the full picture....Pelosi pushed for mail in ballots to throw a monkey wrench in the American Election Process sure but also, She wanted all the Democrats to VOTE EARLY before all the Documents are Released that will "BLOW UP" the Democratic Party.
