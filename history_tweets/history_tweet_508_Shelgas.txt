1332033939075190787 2020-11-27 02:50:13 +0800 <Shelgas> All 4 justices that ruled AGAINST the Constitution are a disgrace.
1331751227386966016 2020-11-26 08:06:50 +0800 <Shelgas> @TheRealBriBri17 Sorry about the misinfo. That was bugging me all day! But it makes sense now.
1331750026478051331 2020-11-26 08:02:03 +0800 <Shelgas> @TheRealBriBri17 OK. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in 12/17 and later tried to withdraw his guilty plea, a "pardon" spares Flynn the possibility of any prison sentence, which Sullivan could potentially have imposed had he decided to reject the Justice Department's dismissal request.
1331710464624123905 2020-11-26 05:24:51 +0800 <Shelgas> @realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn Will someone please explain to me a pardon without a conviction!
1331604329757863939 2020-11-25 22:23:06 +0800 <Shelgas> @RepAndyBiggsAZ Shame is lame. I want to see prosecutions.
1331603223224983560 2020-11-25 22:18:43 +0800 <Shelgas> @gatewaypundit It takes years of practice to say something that stupid with a straight face.
1331463126517239808 2020-11-25 13:02:01 +0800 <Shelgas> @Songbabe109 "Trump tells confidants" who immediately blab to the press? Not buying it.
1331443001646866432 2020-11-25 11:42:03 +0800 <Shelgas> @TheRealBriBri17 Flynn can't be pardoned because he was never convicted. The case is still in limbo until it is eventually thrown out. No pardon needed.

1330530956336373760 2020-11-22 23:17:54 +0800 <Shelgas> They are terrified of loosing control of the narrative.

1329924886140162056 2020-11-21 07:09:36 +0800 <Shelgas> @JenniferJJacobs @alexsalvinews How many times was he tested. It takes 4 just for 50% accuracy.
1329820246140719104 2020-11-21 00:13:48 +0800 <Shelgas> @PAHouseGOP @iowa_trump From what I've seen of those pole workers, there is no way I would trust some of them with my sacred vote.

1328422049224814600 2020-11-17 03:37:52 +0800 <Shelgas> @Mountainminder @Breaking911 started this nonsense last week. I finally got fed up and unfollowed. If people retweet their crap, I'll block.
1328020254363160576 2020-11-16 01:01:16 +0800 <Shelgas> You are here: But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.
1327798359525036033 2020-11-15 10:19:32 +0800 <Shelgas> Please stop saying this. I'm one of these people. I can't just sell my house and leave. I have to stay and fight!

1327083573631967235 2020-11-13 10:59:14 +0800 <Shelgas> I just realized.  It's the middle of November. Why have I not been inundated with ads to get a flu shot? And why haven't I seen any Black Friday blockbuster ads? (well, except for the shopping networks)

1326005033796841472 2020-11-10 11:33:30 +0800 <Shelgas> Are you trying to compete with the Babylon Bee?
1325937310807052290 2020-11-10 07:04:24 +0800 <Shelgas> What about the ones that have already made it to the landfill without ever having been counted?
1325911007550722054 2020-11-10 05:19:53 +0800 <Shelgas> Dear God I hope this means they busted the Dems for cheating in her district!

1325661729725050882 2020-11-09 12:49:20 +0800 <Shelgas> There is no Pres-elect Biden. Typical lying politician spewing meaningless empty words and lies.
1325656582668038144 2020-11-09 12:28:53 +0800 <Shelgas> @prayingmedic So it's because of his ego and not because he cares and loves this country?

1325115803168104452 2020-11-08 00:40:01 +0800 <Shelgas> Just because this propaganda rag says it, does not make it true. AP just sealed their conviction. Or should I say unsealed?
1325100072334479362 2020-11-07 23:37:31 +0800 <Shelgas> This feels like 2018 elections all over again. Trucks full of bins of ballots being delivered in the middle of the night, voting machine totals changed. The difference this time is people are fighting.
1325099118310662144 2020-11-07 23:33:43 +0800 <Shelgas> @RedPillBM I just heard Dershowitz say computers make mistakes. No! They don't!
1324881736648560641 2020-11-07 09:09:55 +0800 <Shelgas> @TomFitton Which begs the question, who's job is it to arrest these law breakers?!
1324872398232023040 2020-11-07 08:32:49 +0800 <Shelgas> @MichaelCoudrey This would explain why we can't get rid of Durbin and Bustos.
1324841898192896000 2020-11-07 06:31:37 +0800 <Shelgas> @EmeraldRobinson He didn't say there are no watermarks. He said CISA does not print or audit ballots.  He did say watermarks can be used in ballot security measures by the states.

1324365428542550025 2020-11-05 22:58:18 +0800 <Shelgas> @cjtruth Is it based on the Chicago model?  Illinois Democrats have been fine tuning their election fraud system for a half a century.
1324184239739408385 2020-11-05 10:58:19 +0800 <Shelgas> Exactly! Because the Democrats haven't figure out how to cheat with that kind of system.
1324160337340473349 2020-11-05 09:23:20 +0800 <Shelgas> Agreed

1324073724618940424 2020-11-05 03:39:10 +0800 <Shelgas> @MajorPatriot Elections used to work just fine. What we need to do is plug the wholes the Dems have used to cheat. And unfortunately, it seems we will need some Federal rules because not all states like to play nice.
1324018158727012352 2020-11-04 23:58:22 +0800 <Shelgas> The people who voted for Trump but then voted Democrats into the Senate and House, basically voted for Trump with handcuffs.
1324013192692043778 2020-11-04 23:38:38 +0800 <Shelgas> And MSM will back him up!
1324012965155188739 2020-11-04 23:37:44 +0800 <Shelgas> @SenatorDurbin Hey @Twitter , you recently suspended me accusing me of being a bot account. Just take a quick look at these for a real example of what bots look like.

1323778964398219266 2020-11-04 08:07:54 +0800 <Shelgas> @Breaking911 Go back and look at what the House was actually doing between 2016-2018.  They were renaming post offices "and other things" all over the country. I think they were laying the groundwork way back then.

1323758699563929607 2020-11-04 06:47:22 +0800 <Shelgas> I hope we get the numbers of first time voters for this election. My guess is it's huge!!!
1323715272033841155 2020-11-04 03:54:48 +0800 <Shelgas> Why does it seem to be so easy for the left to remove someone and so hard for conservatives?
1323714043845238788 2020-11-04 03:49:56 +0800 <Shelgas> So is this a Federal offense? Felony?
1323713200051916803 2020-11-04 03:46:34 +0800 <Shelgas> Exactly
1323709232307408899 2020-11-04 03:30:48 +0800 <Shelgas> No

1320110377624084481 2020-10-25 05:10:15 +0800 <Shelgas> @LindaLiberty9 @ShawnG927 Totally agree! Whenever I see "elite ruling class" I was to scream! It's an affront to our constitutional republic.
1319838442436648960 2020-10-24 11:09:40 +0800 <Shelgas> @Songbabe109 Agreed. I think Jared is as brilliant as Trump and loathes the stench of the swamp. Especially the lying media.

1319800512200531968 2020-10-24 08:38:57 +0800 <Shelgas> @SVNewsAlerts I saw a horrific video of a young man who was hog tied, gagged and blindfolded who's entire front was cut open and his organs exposed while he was awake. He was even slapped for moving too much.  Now I stop and ask "do I really want to see this?" Cuz you can't unsee this stuff.

And if it didn't pass the Senate, it's not the Dems fault (it's a given they will vote against the people) it's the Rep fault since the they hold the majority.
