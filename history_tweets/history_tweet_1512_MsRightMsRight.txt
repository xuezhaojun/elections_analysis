I don't have to be a scientist to know that Government's LIE. READ information published by actual scientists/medical professionals who don't have an AGENDA.

C’mon please. Talk about sitting on the sideline. Everyone that does not speak out are complicit in these murders

That does not fit in with the elite agenda plan. Hence the vaccination &amp; Do Not Resuscitate orders &amp; all those in the care homes that were left to rot
1343862361837461504 2020-12-29 18:12:09 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @chocolatefireg2 Too much invested in it, plus it’s there to serve the depopulation agenda too.

1341761111033561088 2020-12-23 23:02:32 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Well who’d have guessed? a loophole in Tier 4 - if you have a baby under 1.     Seeing it yet ?  https://t.co/91iSRg6nZK

1341731930723725312 2020-12-23 21:06:35 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @NHSuk Your not offering a good service. Therefore I withdraw my funding.   You will only see people who want a poisonous vax. Those whom have not spoken out are complicit in the crimes against humanity. We will remember you all and how youve treated us all, with DNR orders etc.
1341729233404620800 2020-12-23 20:55:52 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> If your not seeing your family at Christmas because Boris said you can’t, but your still going to work as Boris said that’s OK. I think you need to slap yourself. You can work all week with Dave &amp; Karen &amp; sit next to them in the van, but you then can’t meet them outside of work ?
1341727673865875456 2020-12-23 20:49:40 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @speakeezie It’s just pure and simple radiation poisoning! The government gave cv19 the same symptoms to disguise the 5G radiation poisoning.
1341727174236188674 2020-12-23 20:47:41 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @MrsSMHI Brainwashed as. They’ll be partaking in the bell ringing for loneliness on Christmas Eve too - another phy-op.

1341064025568927752 2020-12-22 00:52:34 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @CambodiaKerri @JohnMay03231265 @AndrewYang Really ?  https://t.co/ht95IIgoDd
1341063828260438019 2020-12-22 00:51:47 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @CambodiaKerri Correct. Each to their own, none of us are perfect. Take a peek at Agenda21 &amp; the NWO because that’s what all this alleged virus is about. Let’s hope it’s only a saline solution you got or they’ve been truthful to you about the contents of the vaccination .  https://t.co/e5jeiEC5mP
1341062025934454785 2020-12-22 00:44:37 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @CambodiaKerri @JohnMay03231265 @AndrewYang Sorry if that’s sounds harsh, but I’m fed up of being lied to by the government. Your daughter is lovely, she has a very cheeky mischievous face, I can imagine she’s lots of fun &amp; keeps you on your toes. Give her a huge hug from me.
1341061470617030665 2020-12-22 00:42:24 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @CambodiaKerri @JohnMay03231265 @AndrewYang But the chances of dying with covid are about 1%, it’s only been those who have been on end of life care, or serious underlying conditions that have died. To me, even more of a reason NOT to be a guineapig for an untested vax with the responsibilities you have for your daughter.
1341059635139276803 2020-12-22 00:35:07 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Travis_A9 Quick halt all shearing until 2025.

Also why a vax for something with a flawed test system &amp; a 99% recovery rate. Cv19- It’s Flu rebranded nothing more.  https://t.co/TDdiKKLvOH

1340773050644656128 2020-12-21 05:36:20 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Is it because the Contract summary is given out and closed (to those applicants who wanted it) 9/11/20 So then they have 9/11/20 /. 20/11/20 to send in their application ?
1340741392180654080 2020-12-21 03:30:32 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> 42k contract awarded on 9th Nov  2020. But then it says contract end date 20th Nov 2020 ?       So, is this an 11 Day contract worth £42k ....or have they got year wrong and should it be 2021 ?  https://t.co/E6kv6ohh6x

The population cull was to be the Elderly, Disabled &amp; BAME community. Everyone needs to stand together &amp; say NO to the vaccination. We are strong together,they tried to divide us with race/ religion etc when infact the majority of us all get on

1339210720928534528 2020-12-16 22:08:11 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @stevecitizen838 Exactly that. They got there just desserts too eventually.
1339210174523977728 2020-12-16 22:06:01 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @BarrySheerman What is deeply worrying is Why on earth are you pushing a untested vaccination like a drug peddler? Shame on you. Just Remember Sheerman if you get taken to the NHS you’ll have a DNR order slapped on you. Where’s your proof this vax saves lifes? Your outrageous claims are liable  https://t.co/I8ZWoZzR1U
1339206295182860291 2020-12-16 21:50:36 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @themood2020 Sorry that is NOT an excuse, whilst ever they remain silent peoples parents, sisters, brothers and relatives are being MURDERED. They are as complicit in the murder as those making the rules are if they choose not to speak out. Have they got NO morals or a zero morality compass.
1339185562364895233 2020-12-16 20:28:13 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @MattHancock Shame the NHS couldn’t see to and treat the rest of the population isn’t it? we can’t see Cancer patients, but hey look how many Drs &amp; nurses we have to vax you. You really are shameful Matt Mengele -Death Secretary.
1339155554728620039 2020-12-16 18:28:59 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @SmithTarquin Another one for you to push too the “sterility element “. This applies to both females and males re fertility. Anyone taking this is mental !  https://t.co/stOFH8BRtu

Anyway if you believe it’s a miracle cure then roll up your sleeve and off you trot for the saviour vaccination. Me - il take my chances with the alleged virus!  https://t.co/9zjaJo4fX8
1339136934556348416 2020-12-16 17:14:59 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @1964_skb @JeremyVineOn5 The vaccination has never been about a cure for an alleged virus. Look up agenda 21. Agenda 2030. And Event 201. It’s about depolarisation via sterilisation &amp; brain control via nanochip technology &amp; a Nazi state.  https://t.co/THu5xwsCBD
1339134398369845248 2020-12-16 17:04:55 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> They’ll be bottling it and selling it soon. Just like in the Lorax.
1339133773963808769 2020-12-16 17:02:26 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @nudger1966 @Chloe7Acton Has the fact a vaccination is being made for something with a 99% survival rate gone straight over your head ? Yes, someone would turn that money down actually- someone with common sense and ethical standards for a start. Big pharmaceuticals care only about money not people.
1339132973506027521 2020-12-16 16:59:15 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @JamesMcGuckin2 @Charlotte3003G You are correct. The elderly, disabled and BAME are on the cull list. The elderly more so as they know history, which is currently now a repeat of naziGermay. They want your pension pots &amp; properties.
1339132105637367808 2020-12-16 16:55:48 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @JeremyVineOn5 No.
1339130536984530946 2020-12-16 16:49:34 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @1964_skb @JeremyVineOn5 Why should they be tested ? Have you not heard the tests throw off 90% false positive readings. The hospital Drs and nurses who were dealing with patients were not tested regularly &amp; most not at all, so why should care home staff. #Agenda21
1339129054822346753 2020-12-16 16:43:41 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> If you’ve not already, remove your kids from school
1339128816170639362 2020-12-16 16:42:44 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @nudger1966 @Chloe7Acton And in fairness... they’re only thinking of the huge profits they stand to gain from this scamdemic, ask yourself which genuine company makes a vaccination for an alleged virus with a 99% survival rate?. Follow the money.

1338983822050856961 2020-12-16 07:06:34 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @SmithTarquin Employers have a duty of care and to protect all Employees, remember company policy or guidance is not Law. Therefore in my opinion It would not be considered reasonable to ask or try to cohearse staff into taking a vaccination as they have no medical say over your body.
1338979729303597056 2020-12-16 06:50:19 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @IshaX3111 @adiktive956 ANOTHER NO “smart boilers become ‘smart’ when paired with a smart thermostat.

All comms then must be in dated letters or emails so you can keep a track of what’s been said, make sure you keep a copy of all sent items &amp; replies for future ref.

1338976321255464962 2020-12-16 06:36:46 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> The Gvmnt grinch will try to snatch Christmas in a last minute attempt to coerce people into the vax, No matter what you do, they’ll keep saying it’s rising, so spend Christmas with your loved ones as it may be the last one you ever get to spend with them.

1337710863466311681 2020-12-12 18:48:17 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @AerialBolero @EssexPR Agreed. If the clowns actually thought for themselves and grew a pair we’d all not be in this mess now.
1337707339894452224 2020-12-12 18:34:17 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @JanettedelvD They want the kids back purely for vaccination purposes. Once they’ve had Flu &amp; HPV you watch schools will probably not return after Xmas, designed to put further pressure on working parent with kids not being at school, this not enabling one of the parents to goto work.
1337704798565576704 2020-12-12 18:24:11 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @educationgovuk Not whist they are mask wearing. Hand sanitising and satanic distancing it doesn’t.

To me, the sleep feature, is a clever ploy to  encourage you to wear it 24/7 and to bed. Notice how all the smart monitoring items are highly pushed, mostly free or on offer. Ie Alexa.  Another danger is the wireless earphones.
1337697151678373890 2020-12-12 17:53:48 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> 1. Another No from me. Heart monitoring, GPS tracking etc, stuck directly on your skin for the majority of the day, calling for a Wi-fi signal, why do you need a watch to tell you how much sleep you’ve had?

1337494904537223171 2020-12-12 04:30:09 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @jkcainey No one dies FROM cv19. People have allegedly died with it. But even that’s questionable with a 97% false positive rate on the tests which were not even fit for purpose or designed to detect it.
1337494403393462275 2020-12-12 04:28:09 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Why is Yorkshire cv19  R Rate below 1, but here we are still in T3 Yet London’s R Rate is above 1 yet they are still in T2. It doesn’t take much research to show your being played like a player.

Doesn’t go to the practice to my knowledge, goes straight to that Drs wage, like the rest of the incentive pay they get for every vaccination they give.

1336066074048139265 2020-12-08 05:52:29 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> 3. the millions ploughed into this virus could have been helped these people that have just been forgotten about. Because there was no profit to be made from helping them. some of us have family members that are being denied life saving treatment because of this plandemic.
1336066071418302464 2020-12-08 05:52:28 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> 2. but now they want us ALL to be vaccinated costing billions for a virus that had a 99% plus recovery rate to protect us. For any one that thinks us so called conspiracy theorists are wrong, what about the real folk that have suffered for all these years with no help?
1336066068880748550 2020-12-08 05:52:28 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> 1. Wow we have children dying from starvation in this world ( the cure being food )we have homeless dying of hypothermia, while we have empty properties. We have everything in this world that should mean no one suffers needlessly, but what have the government ever done about this

There is NO VIRUS the only thing making you sick is the 5g. That’s exactly why it went up at warp speed during lockdown.  Wuhan 1st place to install it, princess cruise ship 1st boat with it.

1335626176933621760 2020-12-07 00:44:29 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @leedslovingdaz Thanks Dazza. See they coving ass with this - Fertility It is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has an impact on fertility.
1335626026144198657 2020-12-07 00:43:54 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Here the cv19 Vax info sheet. They are covering their arses already..... “Fertility -It is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has an impact on fertility”           they know it has a sterility agent in it.  But anyone wanting to be government guineapigs -be my guest

1335376244746104835 2020-12-06 08:11:21 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> From 1957 to 1962 they promoted this as a SAFE wonder drug to stop morning sickness. it took them 5 years to withdraw it. Don’t fall for it again.  Makes you wonder if they were trying to depopulate even back then ?  There’s a reason why they want to eradicate history.  https://t.co/DwLAgR1C7V

1335157424664227846 2020-12-05 17:41:50 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> 🚫Imagine such EVIL that gives you a Vax that once the majority have partaken in it, they then find out it kills you - UNLESS you pay every year for another vax they invent to just keep you alive? Don’t put it past them. ☠️ @freenationtoday @DarrenPlymouth @LordBrexit
1335155457934172161 2020-12-05 17:34:01 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @charliethornton Correct. It’s missed the zero off my 7.     Yes stored at minus 70.
1335153884550074369 2020-12-05 17:27:46 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @paulmyth It’s 2 jabs at £12 per jab. Notice they’ve not said if you’ll have to have the vax continually ? Il bet they’ll have to have it twice a year to survive. Imagine an evil that gives you a Vax that kills you unless you pay every year for another vax to just keep you alive?
1335152713211006978 2020-12-05 17:23:07 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> So what’s the answer they have given for having to store the Cv19 vax at minus 7 degrees ?  No other vax is stored this way. Ask yourself what’s in this vax that’s not in any of the others. And psst don’t get it either.    https://t.co/lPqnf09g3M
1335151345784020992 2020-12-05 17:17:41 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @2013Boodicca Exactly why they make cannabis illegal. They know it’s a cure for many many things. The cancer cure was found long ago. The worst thing is THEY give you the cancers via things in your foods, hair dye, deodorants, house cleaning products. Use natural things when you can
1335149888800219142 2020-12-05 17:11:54 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> If the vax worked- as plebs we’d be last in the queue, The Queen, &amp; government would all go first! Stop being so brainwashed! The vax is for the over 80s It’s a cull of the elderly to steal their pensions &amp; eradicate history knowledge. If you have elderly in care GET THEM OUT.
1335148214585004034 2020-12-05 17:05:14 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Couldn’t get to see your GP’s all year, but il bet the Bastards open their doors and WILL SEE YOU NOW .....to give you that vax! Add a nice little bribe to their wages of just over £22 per person injected.  What could go wrong with a rushed vax and a crooked company that make it?

They will be replaced with a one world army. Anyone sick well, sick slaves can’t work, it’s not rocket science that they end upon the cull pile too.

Not the elderly in care homes, with no visitors!! .......Think about it.

1334835083157659657 2020-12-04 20:20:58 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @DavidTruthist Yes because when they die, it’ll bump up the cv19 figures for them, to further try and justify the draconian lockdown. No deaths will be allocated to the vaccination. They are just so predictable.

1334805628552962050 2020-12-04 18:23:55 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @AnnaBrook17 Absolutely but big pharmaceutical don’t like it.
1334805338126766081 2020-12-04 18:22:46 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @BangoBilly For the MPs yes. Unfortunately the elderly won’t be so lucky they’ll get the real deal ☠️ . If you have elderly in care please try and protect them from the vax.
1334804521248313344 2020-12-04 18:19:31 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @PirateLCH Thing is they’d never let it be common knowledge if it was. Just like they don’t list the sterility agents they put in the vax, we know they’re there but they obviously don’t advertise it. It’s called thinking outside the box which many folk can’t do as we’ve seen with the masks
1334803743846637569 2020-12-04 18:16:26 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> The elderley, and staff in care homes are to become the real guniea pigs for the vaccine. WHY NOT VACCINATE THE POLITICIANS AND MEDIA FIRST.
1334802547605991426 2020-12-04 18:11:41 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Changed there minds on front line NHS workers for the vax now. Just back to the original plan of wiping out the Elderly, sick &amp; BAME community then.  Watch out folks there coming for your family members with this vax.

1334771451308748800 2020-12-04 16:08:07 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Are you really TRUSTING the manufacturers of the vaccine to LIST ALL INGREDIENTS ?

1334435191536889856 2020-12-03 17:51:56 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> So, for Xmas your loving government will give you a free vax,this vax will help them achieve their Depopulation Agenda &amp; leave the younger generation sterile, which Gates already did with the poor souls of Africa he sterilised. Don’t believe me ? Get researching or be a guineapig

The new cv19 will more than likely have a sterility agent in it, quicker depopulation for them or any to ensure any future survivors can’t reproduce. There’s been a lot of people with sterility in the HPV jab

Just like Khan did when he’d said he’d had the flu jab, even though the needle still had the cap on.  It’s simple, just don’t get the vax.

The government does not give you anything good for free.
1334213912871530505 2020-12-03 03:12:39 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Best get refusing that vax folks.

If you don’t listen NOW &amp; you keep complying, then just remember the next conspiracy is the concentration camps. Seeing it YET?

They’ll never have been more conned in their life than with this vax, a vax so great it’s got indemnity. Form a line sheep or should that be experimental guineapig

1334095470684155904 2020-12-02 19:22:01 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @TheCoronaCure_ A virus -that’s not even  been proved to exist!! Compare 5G radiation poisoning symptoms to cv19 they are same. Wuhan dropping dead, princess cruise ship 1st ship to have 5g, Botswana 5g turn on killed hundreds of elephants. They were the experiment to see how far to crank it up.
1334094334925434883 2020-12-02 19:17:30 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @MattHancock 🆘The death secretary want you to take the death vaccination. A vax so safe it has an indemnity clause. Your taking a vax for a virus not proved to even exist. Only the stupid will comply.   Anyone for being a Gvmnt guineapig. Think thalidomide &amp; swine flu folks.  🚫🚫🚫🆘🆘🆘🆘
1334092779522232320 2020-12-02 19:11:19 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @TheCoronaCure_ It’s a choice between freedom or death from the vaccination it’s not a hard choice.

1334088085076897792 2020-12-02 18:52:40 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @EssexPR Yes but the elderly &amp; others are being brainwashed into it. They can’t research on computers so they rely on MSM who are constantly ramming lies down their throats.  A new vax with an indemnity clause, if it’s so safe why the indemnity? I’m glad I don’t have elderly in care!
1334087008105492481 2020-12-02 18:48:23 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @EssexPR A virus with a 99% survival rate. Absolutely no need for any vax. They said thalidomide and swine flu vax were safe. How quickly people forget history. Don’t say you wernt warned take at your own peril. #Agenda21
1334086558497071104 2020-12-02 18:46:36 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @EssexPR If all the vaxers think after taking it there going to be free and back to normal than they’re as brainwashed as they were when wearing the masks.  Anyone stupid enough to be a guineapig should 1st ask for the Gvmnt for clarification re the freedom they are expecting once taken

1333545466336833536 2020-12-01 06:56:29 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @kateferguson4 And ..... let them go bust. I for one won’t be conned into a vax that’s going to potentially kill you anyway, dead people won’t be going to football or the cinema anyway. More farcical scare tactics.

1333535975272800260 2020-12-01 06:18:47 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @LaraCrabb Because they don’t want you to have pets. Especially guard dogs.  Take no notice. There is no virus and your pets can’t catch or spread it.

1333469484510744581 2020-12-01 01:54:34 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Chrissytn1 I Remember when pop man used to come round &amp; if you returned your old pop bottle you got 10p off another one lol. Bring back proper recycling like this used to be. Glass bottles sterilised and reused. No waste.

How much you been paid to sell the vaccination agenda? or are you waiting for your bonus £25 quid for each person you vaccinate? Your a disgrace to the profession - Drug peddler.

1332997199056293889 2020-11-29 18:37:52 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @TwangyBrit Definitely something dodgy with that, although they have now changed this on their webpage to the “not secret menu” which is even more suspicious. So we have a shop that’s had 50k of ordered for 9 meals in the space of months, but still has to close. Narrrr I’m not buying it.  https://t.co/WVpkjKcb5j

1332992789873823744 2020-11-29 18:20:21 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> How many more lies can HanCOCK tell. Where’s the detailed receipts for all the meals that we’ve paid for ! Bloody disgusting when they wouldn’t entertain kids school dinners but they’ll spend 50k on 9 meals. Even stranger the restaurant has now closed down, after 50k spent there
1332989800350093313 2020-11-29 18:08:28 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @2013Boodicca @Lucky_SoulRadio Or truthful. If anyone believes anything bill gates says, then I’ve got some hens teeth to sell you.

1332778886573285379 2020-11-29 04:10:23 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @onotcomply Welcome lovely.
1332775226774609928 2020-11-29 03:55:50 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> You’ve been warned.
1332775022151274497 2020-11-29 03:55:01 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @davidkurten And well done you for attending. Respect.
1332774635528708106 2020-11-29 03:53:29 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> All these for peaceful protests. Where were they when the BLM matched. Where were they when the statues were toppling down. Il tell you - Too busy bloody kneeling. This current police force is an absolute joke.
1332774156698574853 2020-11-29 03:51:35 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @rob_miller12345 Because people submitted their freedoms by mask wearing and complying with the rest of the bollocks.

1332759645518245896 2020-11-29 02:53:55 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> They’ve definitely forgotten very quickly.
1332758929806331905 2020-11-29 02:51:04 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @MetPoliceEvents If those peaceful people protesting ever decided to turn on you, you’d definitely know about it. The amount of police negligence and lack of knowledge of LAW re cv19 is truly disgusting by all the police forces. But esp from the MET where C. DICK actively encouraged bullying
1332756866116542464 2020-11-29 02:42:52 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Hissyfits5 They will goad one step too far at one of these protests, if the people decided to dish out some backlash, the police would be in some very very serious trouble, as they’d be outnumbered greatly. They should tread very carefully &amp; treat the public with respect.
1332754985214423040 2020-11-29 02:35:24 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Richard09380984 Agreed Richard, whilst some of us scrimp to get by, he’s dishing out our money like there’s no tomorrow. Some struggling to place a meal on table whilst he’s allegedly treating his staff to takeaways with our cash, Like rubbing people’s noses in it.
1332691088038129664 2020-11-28 22:21:30 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Don’t forget the HS2 is in their draconian plans too. Don’t allow it to happen.  https://t.co/Huv05pXZpv

It would have made no difference to me to credit you - if that’s where I got it from.  But it wasn’t.

Next you’ll be saying anyone who posts about cv19 vax or any upcoming event stole that idea from you too. The person who’s work it is, is credited in the original post. So stop bleating 🐑

1332051257775820805 2020-11-27 03:59:02 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Everyone now arguing that because of low infection rates, their area should be in Tier 1 rather than 2 or 3.  Whereas in reality, they shouldn't be in a Tier AT ALL.  Welcome to open air prison folks. Guaranteed to get worse, unless you grow a pair.  #Agenda21 #Agenda2030

1332030343428366336 2020-11-27 02:35:56 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @DancerDad Because it’s never been about the alleged virus. It’s about control and stealing your freedoms chunk by chunk.
1332029722042228736 2020-11-27 02:33:28 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @SandraWeeden Personally with the amount of deception I wouldn’t trust them to print the truth on the insert anyway. Don’t care what’s in it. It’s not for me. Il use my immune system.
1332015480165556225 2020-11-27 01:36:52 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @AuriaZepherine I think the first person to go for the fake virus vaccination should ask for the insert and then walk out with it saying they need time to read through it all carefully before consenting.
1332014303164174336 2020-11-27 01:32:12 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @fabtantrum Don’t care I’m not having it. Anyone stupid enough to get it after all the info there is out there on it ,well they can just feel free and have mine too.

1331971792316067841 2020-11-26 22:43:16 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @DailyMailUK seriously?? Why encourage mask wearing which causes bacterial phenomena for an alleged virus. With a 99% survival rate. Showing the young girl wearing a mask trying to make it a fashion statement is also below the belt   I’m not impressed at all.  https://t.co/GAyXBkUDzd

1331969369946152967 2020-11-26 22:33:39 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> 3. This is the article by the NHS that makes the claim that vaccines do not contain mercury/thimersol even tho they clearly do.   https://t.co/jU19iyBGZH
1331969367567962114 2020-11-26 22:33:38 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> 2. This claim has been proven to be false as it is listed on the box of many intramusculer vaccines including the flu shot.  We suggest you do not take information shared by the NHS the Mainstream media or government as fact and do your own independent research.
1331969364254453762 2020-11-26 22:33:37 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> 1. Independent Public FactCheckers have fact checked the NHS and found the NHS article why vaccination is both safe and important.  To contain both false and misleading information that is a danger to public health the article says that vaccines do not contain mercury/thimersol.

1331956815731560448 2020-11-26 21:43:46 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Jool313 Councils are profiteering from the lockdown.  They receive £1 per person for everyone in tier-2.  £2 per person for tier -3.   No payment incentive for them to keep you in tier1. You will never be out of the tiers unless you rebel against the draconian measures.
1331935739144232962 2020-11-26 20:20:01 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Where is the EXIT STRATEGY PLAN for the alleged virus? C’mon folks you must be able to see it.

But with all the money invested in them it’s not going to happen. The more that hook up to 5g on their phones etc the worse it’ll probably get &amp; let’s not forget it’s a military grade weapon.

If you ever managed to claim, which ask any vaccine injured parents it’s very very difficult to prove, it would take you 4- 6 years. By which time the vax could have killed you anyway. Why take the chance? Who needs that poison in their body ?

1329873247429677056 2020-11-21 03:44:24 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Most want to get tested because they’re either being paid for getting tested or they want two weeks off work. Then there’s the other idiots with a slight sniffle convinced they are dying of rona.
1329872182042832898 2020-11-21 03:40:10 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @neilsco91038181 Yes I’d corrected it somewhere in the tweet. Me bad.
1329853624927850497 2020-11-21 02:26:26 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @DisparatePost Mines meant to say March not May.
1329817504936566786 2020-11-21 00:02:54 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @KEV26105 15th March. Not may. Ops me bad.
1329817092510478338 2020-11-21 00:01:16 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Mocha63825993 Correct, don’t let them poison your children.
1329816683524055040 2020-11-20 23:59:38 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @kenkelly1 Correct. It’s March. I had may on the brain lol.

1329763183532371968 2020-11-20 20:27:03 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> 15th May 2020. You seeing it yet ???  https://t.co/UynkreQ0RT
1329761739743883268 2020-11-20 20:21:19 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @sarahpye18 I know what your saying Sarah but forewarned is forearmed so to speak. It’s like me asking do you have genuine proof cv19 exists?
1329760774374486016 2020-11-20 20:17:29 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Janice95147072 Did you notice whilst vaccinations were not being distributed cot deaths non existent ? How many Vax injuries have caused death &amp; it’s been blamed on cot death rather than the vaccine ?
1329759603853234177 2020-11-20 20:12:49 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Read the last part, then re read it again.  Still want the cv19 vaccination ? Not managed a cure for cancer (allegedly) but have managed to find one for this. Anyone thinking of taking it should be doing some serious research &amp; asking questions, especially with the indemnity.  https://t.co/LQ80Baiuki
1329738515400232960 2020-11-20 18:49:02 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @sarahpye18 Go up the thread. Someone who works in one of the care homes has commented.

1329736482828021760 2020-11-20 18:40:57 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @LizElen1 You obviously can’t see that there is no cv19 it’s a hoax.
1329736060155404293 2020-11-20 18:39:16 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @sarahpye18 It’s also how sometimes information that’s kept under wraps also makes people aware. Also if you read on the thread it was confirmed.
1329735686619066368 2020-11-20 18:37:47 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @mandylm81 I agree. But if people see there is no one getting tested hopefully it will slightly open their tightly shut eyes.

1329526515097329667 2020-11-20 04:46:37 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Essex care homes ! Be aware.   apparently 20 care homes are piloting the vax??  although I can’t confirm this info.  https://t.co/GITWOQq1fg

1329499471831511041 2020-11-20 02:59:09 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @keepitsimple369 The MMR was combined if you recall I’d guess around 2000 maybe earlier. When you look at ingredients it’s frightening. Nothing more than a money making scheme for big pharmaceuticals to keep you ill so your a repeat customer.  https://t.co/VLpku7Amny

1329492968500293637 2020-11-20 02:33:19 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> They want rid of the elderly, they have too much knowledge, know too much history, they want their pensions and their properties. Quick easy cull for the depopulation agenda. Don’t let them do it.

1329438102742589442 2020-11-19 22:55:18 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @jeremy_hume @mobojo78 It’s a free world. No one owns the trees the waters or the lands. Yet we are charged &amp; taxed to the hilt by certain people whom have put themselves into a power position slot. I hope this Gvmnt go and they are are never replaced.

1329434209811918861 2020-11-19 22:39:49 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE LOCKDOWNS IS FOR PEOPLE TO STOP GETTING TESTED! If we stop getting tested they won't have the statistics to keep us in lockdown. Or force the vaccine on us!
1329432998597586947 2020-11-19 22:35:01 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @fight_lies @Lordgreyofponty Yet the Gvmnt just spend £130 million on stopping people talking about vaccinations.  How much have they spent paying the 77th brigaders?

1329116673987784706 2020-11-19 01:38:03 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @CllrBSilvester But why should even those people who test positive be counted in the death toll when the PCR test are throwing false positives. No one has died from covid ! Underlying conditions yes, covid NO.

1328763617332879360 2020-11-18 02:15:08 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Nice warm 15 degree weather again for November. Weather manipulation?. Notice we’ve had no frost to kill the germs. ? If you don’t think they can manipulate weather then look up operation Popeye.
1328762959162716161 2020-11-18 02:12:31 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @JuliaMiller900 @MikeBul64700146 Sorry but their moral compass is all wrong. Myself, I couldn’t stand by &amp; say nothing. They’ll only speak out when it effects an immediate family member, but by then it maybe too late. Couldn’t live with myself holding back vital info that could potentially save not 1 but 1,000s
1328761550455402499 2020-11-18 02:06:55 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Spangles91 @specialXservice Yes. Certain frogs have the ability to change their gender.

1328673635473760257 2020-11-17 20:17:34 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Hells4Heroes Simple they should be sent home.
1328672999092989955 2020-11-17 20:15:03 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @SandraWeeden I’m sure all the vaccine injured children and parents would have a VERY DIFFICULT PERSPECTIVE on that.
1328672666694332416 2020-11-17 20:13:43 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> So here you have it. That’s your new normal unless you stand up and speak out.
1328672334413262849 2020-11-17 20:12:24 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Times two doses. Soz Doc you’ll not be seeing my £25.16.

1328671990576799745 2020-11-17 20:11:02 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @rob_miller12345 But remember you can’t sue them they have indemnity which possibly includes the person vaxing you. Best bet - don’t get it.
1328671425624989696 2020-11-17 20:08:48 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Bee42681881 Probably caused by vaccinations lol.
1328671214097883136 2020-11-17 20:07:57 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @SandraWeeden I see it that he’s trying to say, he’s had it once &amp; got antibodies, but now he’s caught it again, he will say even though you’ve got antibodies you can still catch it.....cue the miracle vax cure ?
1328651822479892483 2020-11-17 18:50:54 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @ChoonedM @freenationtoday Not heard that re the antibiotics! Deffo weird. But thinking they can’t take your blood / plasma if you’re on antibiotics. Or maybe they don’t want people self medicating, they may be looking at destroying the supplies?

1328650528319004672 2020-11-17 18:45:45 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @freenationtoday By the time they’ve got to 5th question patient is dead. When you see the DNR orders &amp; the resuscitation, where you place a cloth over their mouth &amp; nose when not breathing, WTF, makes you wonder what other rules they have, we don’t know about.
1328649761830940673 2020-11-17 18:42:42 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Ridiculous

1328332800051867648 2020-11-16 21:43:13 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Bear1Kuma Could be either scenarios, who knows. Except 2020 has been one shit show after another and the fact Boris has been involved right from the start, leads me more to believe he’s either part of, or being controlled by the cabal.

1328308531892772867 2020-11-16 20:06:47 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @LBilderberg Climate change and fossil fuels are both massive hoaxes.

1328303294339567621 2020-11-16 19:45:58 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @robinmonotti Absolutely distopian. It’s a free world that no one owns. No one will dictate to me that I will take something I don’t want. The time to rise is here.
1328302314080362497 2020-11-16 19:42:04 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Yup another loada bollox that bumbling Boris had to be told by track n snake.
1328301243584884736 2020-11-16 19:37:49 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Is it because Boris will develop symptoms, thus proclaiming having had the virus it does not mean immunity - and so the MANDATORY VACCINATION roll out begins.?
1328299124568051713 2020-11-16 19:29:24 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @LordBrexit Look at the tweet I’ve just put on re sunak.

Who knows the truth behind Boris going into hiding? Is it the scare tactic, stating I’ve had it once, got antibodies, but now I’ve got it again ? Keeping up the fear

1327561910104035334 2020-11-14 18:39:58 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Fans should have been informed and Should have refused. Is going to a game worth being sprayed with god knows what. Surely they have to give them a leaflet re what’s in the spray? What if someone is allergic to what Evers in that spray. ?
1327560799372636160 2020-11-14 18:35:34 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @kathlee11462722 Yes no inverted one on this piccy.

1327369431350177792 2020-11-14 05:55:08 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @UnityNLove @redpillmonster Keep him off that day otherwise he will get it. Look at implied consent and gillick competence. Kids shed this live flu vax upto 28 days after. Also look up shedding as it can be as bad as letting him have it.  https://t.co/U2bRXCtz7j
1327368503859548160 2020-11-14 05:51:27 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @5Agenda21 I reckon with the amount of people not wanting it he will be at the very front of that queue, and he’s can have mine as a freebie too.
1327367612179820545 2020-11-14 05:47:54 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @SaltySeaDog7 With his cardboard box. For sure a Staged event. Why is he really going ? But we all know it’ll be with a nice big wedge of hush hush money. He will be set for life.

We all find little bits then suddenly the pieces become a bigger picture. Try walking barefoot on soil. Anything Wireless give it a cable. You don’t have a smart meter do you ? If so you need to faraday cage it up.
1327359335886970883 2020-11-14 05:15:01 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @clonk456 Yes and il bet as you moved away your symptoms lessened.

1327348939318829057 2020-11-14 04:33:42 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> That’s because there’s no virus. It’s 5g.  https://t.co/K3PeucK02D

1327348559088394241 2020-11-14 04:32:12 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @mobojo78 Look at 5g towers in your area. When they were activated. Look at the symptoms  https://t.co/xt0WPq92Q2
1327343746611032065 2020-11-14 04:13:04 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @mobojo78 Depends also if you’ve underlying conditions , even ones your not aware of.
1327343380267929600 2020-11-14 04:11:37 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @mobojo78 2 years ago my family were all ill. Flu like symptoms with severe headaches,dizziness and lots of other symptoms. If we’d have had it this year it would be classed as cv19! Think when anyone gets ill this year they automatically assume it’s cv19. 5g has identical symptoms to cv19
1327341282562367495 2020-11-14 04:03:17 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @SGamble123 You are, but they are also asking reasons why you are declining. You shouldn’t have to give a reason why. It’s a simple yes or no answer. Only problem is now with the implied consent &amp; often paperwork declining it gets accidentally lost sometimes!  if you know what I mean.
1327340504468566017 2020-11-14 04:00:11 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @cliff_grieve Yes he’s been caught saying masks were useless. Then going to - everyone must wear them.  Hillary the shill.
1327340270489317376 2020-11-14 03:59:15 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @mobojo78 So what makes you think you had the virus as opposed to the normal flu ? I’m Just curious

1327337994982989824 2020-11-14 03:50:13 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @mobojo78 There is no virus so no one needs a vaccination. Problem solved.   The virus is 5G

Your paperwork saying NO to it mysterious never gets there &amp; they do them anyway. Flu is a live virus that sheds for upto 28 days, homeschooling is the only way.  https://t.co/BiT2J6J7Ks

1327280441196425217 2020-11-14 00:01:31 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @carol36838688 Do your research into this vaccination before even considering taking it. It’s a new rushed MRNA vax, lots have died in the trials. They are that confident in their own product they have No INDEMNITY, if it maims or kills there’s no comeback for the makers !

1327204166314450945 2020-11-13 18:58:26 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @agvBruceAdams I absolutely agree. I don’t think there’s every been a virus. It’s been 5g all along. Wuhan -5G. Princess cruise ship -5G. Botswana installs 5G hundreds of elephants die. 5Gs radiation symptoms are par for par with cv19. Then we had the mass roll out of 5g during lockdown

Look at the great reset and what they want to do. They want you enslaved in debt, why do you think they’re chucking furlough money and loans to them like there’s no tmoz, if you think there’s no catch then your kidding yourself.

The government don’t give you anything for free - there’s ALWAYS a catch.... always !!
1326948385644027905 2020-11-13 02:02:03 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @VegasLocal1 How am I wrong ? It’s what’s occurring right now. The fact you have guns has nothing to do with what’s playing out.
1326947972366667776 2020-11-13 02:00:24 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Get sharing folks.

You will pay a high price from your social credit system for any medical treatments needed or be just left to rot. They have already started if you look, they are hardly treating anyone in hospitals.

1326919176351576064 2020-11-13 00:05:59 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @TooSoon51705384 Exactly that. Leverage and scare tactics for those they can’t trap in the unemployment loop hole.
1326915418427187202 2020-11-12 23:51:03 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> You can see who they want gone first with who they offer the vax to. The plan was for it to be the elderly. Disabled &amp; BAME.  We all need to unite as one for this fight. We all have friends and relatives in all the above 3 categories. #unitethisfight

They should all be made to vote for or against. This not voting either way is a complete cop out. I will remember my local Mp.

The fact it’s rushed &amp; no indemnity is offered says it all anyway. Vax allegedly 90% effective, which you will need 2 shots &amp; then every year thereafter or your own immunity system for a virus with a survival rate over 99%.

1326107186301374464 2020-11-10 18:19:25 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Splintered9 @mobojo78 It would need a min 2 years to start showing any side effects that weren’t currently showing. I Wouldn’t take it if you paid me millions. Have you researched all the ingredients? Poisonous cocktail, narrr not for me. Why would anyone take it when there’s a 99% survival rate?

1325837403437867008 2020-11-10 00:27:24 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> What are the long term implications of a positive test result? It’s already affecting mortgage applications &amp; life-insurance policies. Think before you put yourself forward for that test.

1325823527329689600 2020-11-09 23:32:16 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Let’s look at statistics shall we. The vaccine has a 90% success rate &amp; Covid has a 99% survival rate.  Killer vax with nano chip?  or your own immunity system? It’s not rocket science.

You can buy a natural bar and send it with your child. Many are allergic to hand sanitiser so they can’t force you to use it. Other option is to home school esp with all the Army testing kids.
1325712113223016449 2020-11-09 16:09:32 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @LennyStone11 I have. My problem is they also have the ability to be switched back very very easily to the killing machines they were intended to be. For me, they should go completely.

Who issued that letter. Absolutely bloody disgusting and it would have gone ahead if not exposed. Putting that news out on a fri which was to be actioned on a mon, some1 has a case
1325400573949206530 2020-11-08 19:31:36 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Only when they were EXPOSED &amp; called out did they change this re the Army testing kids at BROADGREEN school.Liverpool without parental consent.

There job is to know the LAW. They’ve had 9 months to get this correct re facemasks etc &amp; yet they still act like unruly children. No disciplinary for those officers ? how will they learn.

1325128778687762432 2020-11-08 01:31:35 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @errjustsaying A test that gives off huge false positives, which then have a knock on repercussions of a 14 day quarantine &amp; help keep everyone in lockdown.

1323222180222717953 2020-11-02 19:15:26 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @CarlDevitt Keep them off that day. Email the school to ask what date are the vaccinations scheduled for. You need to look up shedding too from other kids, goes on for upto 28 days after other kids have been vaxed

1323209334751432704 2020-11-02 18:24:24 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Glen95266596 More than likely true. Shedding can continue for 28 days though.
1323208469139333126 2020-11-02 18:20:57 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @myhollycat I take it yours wasn’t from mask wearing as lots of wearers have suffered with that.
1323207826160930816 2020-11-02 18:18:24 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @BeverleyQQQ17 We will see. Nothing set in stone. So need preparation.
1323207635676602369 2020-11-02 18:17:39 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @ShesElectric777 Look up shedding because it’s equally as bad as taking the vax. The shedding can last 28 days. My suggestion would be take your kids out of school till after Xmas. Problem being once their vaxed by “mistake” it’s then too late, that poisons &amp; sterility crap is in their system.
1323206935445966850 2020-11-02 18:14:52 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @TracyBr96532270 They want you on your knees crumbing, they want to wear people down so much they are willing to accept anything, this is when they’ll be vaccinations, microchips, isolation camps, cashless society credit systems. Get ready China’s totalitarian state is on its way if you let it.
1323205988372107264 2020-11-02 18:11:06 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @tic_peter Yes all to do with the serpent company SERCO. £900 per immigrant.
1323205763741999105 2020-11-02 18:10:12 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @ItsMeKirsty1 They couldn’t buy a few of us with their meals, but how many are they buying and silencing with the furlough scheme money. The cash incentives for testing. All you partaking in handouts for testing are shameful!!
1323205257342685184 2020-11-02 18:08:11 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> If you think by Dec 2nd after another lock down has “allegedly failed”, you’ll be free to go on and celebrate a normal Christmas then - DREAM ON.  choose your side, or forever live where a government are stopping you seeing relatives for a virus with over 96% recovery rates.
1323204281206493185 2020-11-02 18:04:19 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> The schools are allowing kids back because they want them VACCINATED!!  By sending your child on vax day that is NOW CONSIDERED CONSENT by the W.H.O. don’t believe me go look. take your kids out of school. If your kids are at college get them back, a lockdown for Xmas is planned
1323203515645394946 2020-11-02 18:01:16 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @myhollycat No, it’s only a virus, nothing I can give you. Let it run its course, take paracetamol if you need to.
1323203143535153158 2020-11-02 17:59:48 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @tic_peter What did it say Peter? I’ve seen the young fighting aged males come across in their droves, never no women &amp; children.
1323202796141875200 2020-11-02 17:58:25 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @tic_peter Exactly. Locking down, but at the same time allowing people from other countries across. More chance of catching scabies than cv19 !!
1323202451156180994 2020-11-02 17:57:02 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> I said the “eat out voucher scheme” was a huge con to say you’d all been congregating &amp; used get up numbers, (with the false positive tests)  when will people learn the government don’t give you anything good for free, &amp; if you’ve not yet worked that out then slap yourself.  https://t.co/xHEFDolcQ9
1323200702848618496 2020-11-02 17:50:06 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> If you still, after 8 months (your 3 week to flatten the curve) you don’t think your freedoms are being stolen then wake up, every lockdown will impose more restrictions, your freedom is being stolen. What did your Dr say to you if you presented with a virus in the past ? Recall?

1321129017194520577 2020-10-28 00:37:57 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Plane2TheT Yes but no one would recognise is by that name.
1321120939568992257 2020-10-28 00:05:51 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @RedDiesel88 Had a bit of a look of this before. The only reason I could think of is that they wanted to make sure all newborns had chromosome 8 to make them more pliable and easier to control or easier for the NWO &amp; to identify them from others. Not sure I didn’t delve too far into this one.  https://t.co/aDtx7b8KK5

1321083373033541632 2020-10-27 21:36:35 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Robertcass17 It’s called reading back of a packet &amp; making an informed choice. The bed wetters that want this, want a slap. That bracelet will go hand in hand with the cashless society, where you will be told what you can &amp; cant buy !! &amp; it will deduct the price straight from your account.
1321078812248018944 2020-10-27 21:18:27 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @modernwoman13 Yeah I’m sure one will pop up soon.
1321078128991678465 2020-10-27 21:15:45 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> I could be way off here but ..... All these alleged cv19 testings and the ancestry DNA etc etc. It’s become increasingly apparent that they appear to be looking for certain blood lines, families ?That’s my take on it. Is it to offer them salvation to protect that bloodline.?
1321017258777477126 2020-10-27 17:13:52 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @aliceq4 @History_Thieves Suggest they get a lot more pens if that’s the case.

1321009622111703047 2020-10-27 16:43:31 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Are the pop up testing centres going to become the new Army “vaccination stations” ? Or are they there outing the D.u.m b s? This is South Yorkshire.  https://t.co/cg07NxdS6w
1320819718077468672 2020-10-27 04:08:55 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @LBilderberg Let them waste their cash. The government should have charged that per test too, less idiots would have got tested just because they had a slight cough and we wouldn’t be in lockdown.
1320819172033634306 2020-10-27 04:06:44 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Bee42681881 No thanks. They can pretend all they want. They can have mine too. The only disinformation is spread by UNICEF stating vaccinations are good. After all those African children suffered how don’t know how they DARE post that.

1320804961375166464 2020-10-27 03:10:16 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> WHY ???   52 Northern Ireland wind turbine owners have received emergency coronavirus funding from Stormont. A £10,000 payment was sent automatically to any business in receipt of small business rates relief.  https://t.co/6VIFMjR8GC

1320693121584451589 2020-10-26 19:45:52 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @FartItchy Dr Raj and Dr Hillary both push those vaccinations like drug peddlers. But let’s not forget they have to fulfill a quota of vaccinations before they get their bonus money.
1320692561296719872 2020-10-26 19:43:38 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Agreed. Plus the Cpt Toms donations they got!

They also do a convincing fake syringe, which has a blunt needle that appears to go in the arm, but goes back up into the syringe, I posted a video on it a few week back. They can have it &amp; mine too with pleasure. CHARLATANS!!!

1320459290180788227 2020-10-26 04:16:42 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Skully0011 They need a certificate of training and regular calibration for those temp takers, the laser ones if pointed in the eye by accident can cause some significant damage and or blindness. Not to mention it’s a trigger for those whom have had a gun pointed at their head. Do not agree

1320430593532928003 2020-10-26 02:22:40 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Our taxes are paying the NHS. We currently have a service either no one can use and/ or everyone is scared to death to go there, esp with the DNR orders. It’s more like a death camp than a hospital .  You know how they did a defund the BBC? Well .....,

It’s also part of the cv19 plan that no one owns any assets. You will live in a smart city 24/7 surveillance. You will not buy or sell things. The NWO is horror show on legs. #donotcomply
1320352401245732865 2020-10-25 21:11:58 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @seekthetruth27 I think they’d stop the scamdemic virus by shoving them up both nostrils, in your mouth &amp; your arse hole.

1319668650081701888 2020-10-23 23:54:59 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Every time you take a TEST and keep us in lockdown, ASK YOURSELF how many deaths are on your hands?  from keeping us in this lockdown. Suicide. Mental health, cancelled hospital appt. elderly dying from loneliness. Blood on your hands.
1319665909183713282 2020-10-23 23:44:05 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Government Won’t pay meals for the starving kids throughout the school holidays, but they’ll pay you for this shit to keep you locked down.  Anyone who can be bought so easily actually deserves a place in the “smart camps” they have planned for you.
1319664855503220737 2020-10-23 23:39:54 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> It’s ridiculous! My take on this is they are trying to ultimately make it a super shit Christmas, so everyone caves in for the vaccination 💉. Don’t let them dampen your spirts it’s exactly what they want. #wedoNOTconsent
1319664188843839490 2020-10-23 23:37:15 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Nice bribe to keep you in lockdown,whilst they cull the elderly &amp; stop you visiting friends &amp; relatives. It’s being funded by US the taxpayer, So, your ultimately PAYING to be kept in this Lockdown which is going on till at least 2025. Stop taking the test  https://t.co/AfH91nFJrg

1318611723562176514 2020-10-21 01:55:08 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @rdevitoboutin @simondolan Apparently last years super booster, Would be nice to see if all who fell ill this year had last years Flu jab.

1317755180293804032 2020-10-18 17:11:32 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> 4. Why do councils need a bribe? They willingly rolled out 5G whilst you were in the first lockdown, and now the councils are taking government bribes to keep you all locked up, whilst they go about their daily business without a care in the world, they don’t have to worry about
1317755178037268482 2020-10-18 17:11:31 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> 3. If we move from tier 2 to 3 do they get the payment again? Likewise if we move from tier 3 to 2 do they again get the per person payment ? There is NO CASH incentive given for keeping you in tier 1.  So you know you’ll constantly be on Tier 2/3.
1317755175482937344 2020-10-18 17:11:31 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> 2. Why are the Councils given a cash incentive when lockdown in enforced their area, if you go into Tiers 2 &amp; 3 they get a payout, per person. TIER 2 - £1 PER HEAD.  TIER 3 IS - £2 PER HEAD.  Is this a weekly/ monthly payment?
1317755173121437696 2020-10-18 17:11:30 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> ‼️1. This is flu season, The government from 8/10/20 have decided to combine figures for both the FLU and Covid AS ONE UNIT.

Along with that provided road map the Strategic Planning committee was asked to design an effective way of transitioning Canadians to meet a unprecedented economic endeavor. One that would change the face of Canada and forever alter the lives of Canadians.

All I know is that I don’t like it and I think its going to place Canadians into a dark future.  Canadians need a voice and JustinTrudeau needs to lose his. He does not speak for the Majority!

1317486295346745345 2020-10-17 23:23:05 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> 5. Committee members asked who would become the owner of the forfeited property and assets in that scenario and what would happen to lenders or financial institutions, we were simply told “the World Debt Reset program will handle all of the details”. Several committee members

1316222811812360199 2020-10-14 11:42:27 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @PollinatorZen @spiderweb945 Your right they’re not equivalent because flu has a higher kill rate than the alleged virus.
1316178138020352005 2020-10-14 08:44:56 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> when they say the covid ward is full,  but forget to tell you there’s only 8 beds on that ward. !!!Amazing how they can twist things to suit their narrative.
1316161939106672642 2020-10-14 07:40:34 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @DrThomasPaul Parents equally to blame for making or letting their kids wear them.

1316096662763438081 2020-10-14 03:21:10 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @SBretell Way to go. We must not cave in.

1316045867506429953 2020-10-13 23:59:20 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @benn_laverick The fact is when you read behind the lines of whom they want to get rid of first by killing them off with the vaccination is the elderly, disabled &amp; BAME. They’ve already started on the elderly &amp; sick (as we’ve seen from no hospital admissions, they want them all gone. ! )
1316044688168751106 2020-10-13 23:54:39 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Thatcurllyhead @conspiracyb0t No I’ve only heard of it today so not had time to research it fully.
1316044495830609920 2020-10-13 23:53:53 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> The HS2 Trainlines must be stopped. They are sacrificing OUR wildlife, forest areas and trees, for a train that’s going to probably take you off to the concentration camps.
1316044048797437953 2020-10-13 23:52:06 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @westyuk21 @Berumster That’s exactly why people need to take a stand and grow a backbone, because ultimately that’s what it will come to for everyone. But that will be the least of your worries, especially when your all eventually carted off to a smart city, otherwise know as concentration camp.
1316043428585758729 2020-10-13 23:49:38 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @KEastick Personally I think it’s making people with a disability be discriminated against further by having to wear a stupid sticker. You wouldn’t see a wheelchair user with a sticker on stating “wheelchair user” because it’s obvious, as is people who don’t wear masks.
1316042822571773952 2020-10-13 23:47:14 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @annacabanna But your still complying by giving false details, better to flatly refuse and walk out. The sooner they learn we won’t put up with this crap the better. They need our money to survive as a business.

1316032648154935303 2020-10-13 23:06:48 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @KEastick Hmm. They shouldn’t need a sticker.  If your exempt your exempt. Yer don’t need a sticker to highlight your disability issues even further .
1316021357642047489 2020-10-13 22:21:56 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Warnzwifey @talkRADIO @MattHancock @HouseofCommons I agree they gearing up to this vaccination that’s not needed. How many grubby little shares do they all have in vaccinations, vaccinations that they themselves or their families will never get. Think about that one. Even Bill Gates won’t vax his own kids, he knows it’s poison.

1314171889296838656 2020-10-08 19:52:49 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @DeeQuinby If you test positive the cure is 14 day isolation, if your ill, just self isolate for 14 days. Why the need for the test? Or to drive miles for a test when the cure is 14 days?. Dominic Rabb stated the tests are only 7% accurate! Lots of false positives, why bother getting tested  https://t.co/AVOJXS8IkX

1314145449541021696 2020-10-08 18:07:45 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @DeeQuinby Why would you need a test to tell you your ill? I can understand your hospital admission one. Will you test yourself every month just incase you get a different result even though you feel fine, the virus has a lesser kill rate than flu. They are DNA harvesting do some research.
1314144497920602112 2020-10-08 18:03:58 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Thoughts ? President Trump was taking Regeneron's antibody cocktail along with zinc, vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin, aspirin, Dexamethasone and Remdesivir.  “it’s called Regeneron, and other things too, but I think this was the key.”

All the children get councilling at school too, just to make sure they don't go telling tales to their parents, maybe for children who do talk

Unfortunately Op Popeye, northwoods, paperclip, Artichoke, deep freeze. &amp; Monarch MK ultra. Have all been taken. Maybe this one could be operation SCAMDEMIC 2020?
1310611878700363776 2020-09-29 00:06:36 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @ed_itu What you’ve got to understand is people are planted at such protests to purposely cause trouble with the police &amp; incite violence, looking like a few crisis actors were there at this protest.

1310163553530376197 2020-09-27 18:25:07 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> Both same outfit. Later the elderly one of the two is stood on that same chair which is where you see the footage of the police tipping her off.
1310162895758651392 2020-09-27 18:22:30 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> The police incident gets more bizarre by the hour. 2 VERY different aged women, both in same outfit, to find one person in that outfit yes, two absolutely NO. I can only think planted to incite violence into a peaceful protest. Something very very odd going on here.???!  https://t.co/Ca7adNMnFn
1310161672812851203 2020-09-27 18:17:39 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> 2. Please remember to cut the straps of your face covering when disposing of them, and put them in a bin with a secure lid to stop them blowing away. You can find more information and best practices here:  https://t.co/a7wayVnSBx
1310161667360198656 2020-09-27 18:17:37 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> ⚠ SNIP THE STRAPS ⚠  1. Improperly disposed of face coverings can be a hazard to wildlife. Since lockdown, the RSPCA has reported 938 incidents of animals caught in litter, including face mask straps.  Stay safe, thank you.
1310160880433328128 2020-09-27 18:14:30 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @caton_connie The peaked caps are their uniform, in their hands they have their riot helmets, it would be far too hot to stand around in those helmets all day, especially whilst wearing a facemask. One BB Cap can easily be exchanged for the Riot helmet should things get heated.
1310154947657453568 2020-09-27 17:50:55 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Joannew68022274 Looks like two different people to me.  https://t.co/7RsAVHk8ye

1308313263541825537 2020-09-22 15:52:43 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @hbeeeme @crbarnes001 Don’t forget vaccination day &amp; off for the subsequent 5 shedding days after. You need to find out the actual date. I would also as well as sending in your refusal form (if you get 1) also email the headteacher stating you decline all vax. The next is HPV. Don’t allow either.

Research &amp; question what is in that vaccination, &amp; other vaccinations especially aimed at your children, the HPV has sterilised &amp; maimed many, this Vax is being pushed on 11/12 yr old boys &amp; girls, you must look into it before allowing your child to have it in order to make

They are not independent, and they haven't done long term studies on the safety of 5G.

A piccy of 9/11 on social media was removed by fact checker, so did 9/11 not happen just because fact checker says false. Sometimes I think if it’s not on the news it’s often the truth. Time will tell.
1305064718441250816 2020-09-13 16:44:10 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> According to the government cv19 cases are going up . Yet you have been wearing masks since 24th july. Do you get it now? The covid face nappies are submission muzzle tools, which do not work . Stop being played folks.

1304687370793607168 2020-09-12 15:44:43 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> It just so happens this exact same 18-character sequence, verbatim, is also found on Homo sapiens chromosome 8! As far as I can tell, this means that the WHO test kits should find a positive result in all humans. Can anyone explain this otherwise?
1304687367886966784 2020-09-12 15:44:43 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> The sequence “CTCCCTTTGTTGTGTTGT” is an 18-character primer sequence found in the WHO coronavirus PCR testing protocol document. The primer sequences are what get amplified by the PCR process in order to be detected and designated a “positive” test result.

It’s about time some LEGAL people on here put out some free advice on being tested this often at work. It’s got to be against some sort of your rights. C’mon all you Legals offer them a get out clause &amp; free advice.

They are only guidelines which means they are not law, it’s upto the individual pubs to implement it or not. The pubs not doing it are getting the customers. Your ignorance is our freedom!

But they are forbidden from speaking about it,  remember when Eamonn said something about it being connected to 5g, think he said we can’t rule it out, or similar. He had his knuckles rapped over that from producers.

1301245285885267970 2020-09-03 03:47:06 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @zukibites Thing is when your onto something they try to discredit everything you do and say. They’ve done this will all the Drs that have come out too. Both kate &amp; Mark came out well before this gained momentum. Just beware their are paid 77th brigaders on here paid to discredit posts.

They have 5 million invested in 5G do you really think that the companies they had to come &amp; do the testing won’t have been bought &amp; paid for.
1301242469921685506 2020-09-03 03:35:55 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @adrianshort @zukibites @KateShemirani 1 Working for Mark Steele?. They are both their own people. As for that testing you posted about, Gateshead council are bound to have turned down 5G especially when they know people are coming to take readings, you can’t be that naive?  You’ve obviously never whistleblown on such
1301240731655385089 2020-09-03 03:29:00 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @zukibites They are two separate ones. If you can’t make one go to the other or go to both. If you watch the video I’ve posted it explains all in that video.

1300828449796501504 2020-09-02 00:10:45 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> The drive to get them back to school is to create a 2nd lockdown,not for the children’s welfare. Before this they’ll try &amp; vax your child whilst In school. Watch how quickly the vaccinations start once they’re back in school, once vaccinated watch how fast your locked back down.
1300825772672921601 2020-09-02 00:00:07 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> We’re the coroners getting any bonuses for putting cv19 on the death certificates? You know like Drs get a bonus for every vaccination they administer  https://t.co/h2miVlyBQD

1300804987342204928 2020-09-01 22:37:31 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @rustysaddle Once they are in school the schools overtake your parental responsibility as the children are in their care.

1300693828651937792 2020-09-01 15:15:49 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @SaveusnowF Don’t worry Granny we we’ll get them !! For all those poor souls they murdered we must overthrow this government. They have bled the country dry, taxed up to the hilt, all whilst enjoying their 10k extra work from home pay. Absolute ****s

1300692435320877061 2020-09-01 15:10:16 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @EsotericExposal What is the bottom middle part ? Like a ghost house ? The sun is the all seeing eye, looks to predict flat earth with the ice filament.
1300691818611441664 2020-09-01 15:07:49 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @kbeanie93 @LisaFrideborg Done mine. You don’t have to provide all your details! But in light of these 2 lovelies, everyone should get on there and oppose. If you don’t they will give you unlicensed drugs &amp; if there’s a pandemic, yer can bet it’s a MANDATORY one, this is their ultimate aim &amp; end goal.  https://t.co/xzP5YnPLJ5

1300689231946354690 2020-09-01 14:57:33 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @KSbyAuntieNic @q_3verything Go on Facebook find one of @KateShemirani fab videos, which tell you all about vaccinations &amp; show her the video, also show her this.  https://t.co/Sj3O5c6Qcr
1300688735915388929 2020-09-01 14:55:34 +0800 <MsRightMsRight> @Lasella73 No one should be bribed into accepting vaccinations &amp; this, if correct is what this is. I would think, this couldn’t be possibly legal.
