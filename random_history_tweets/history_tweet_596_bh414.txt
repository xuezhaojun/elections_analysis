1341564209776222209 2020-12-23 10:00:07 +0800 <bh414> @GeniusTrader777 @rnocks76 Do you like brtx, for explosive growth potential? Or is 1 of your 4 more of a favorite for meteoric rise?
1341481846694154243 2020-12-23 04:32:50 +0800 <bh414> @stockballa Ahh. Makes sense why you seem to be more positive.  If your setting goals and actually exiting before the rip reaches top.   Thanks for sharing insights to your style.
1341479274243641347 2020-12-23 04:22:37 +0800 <bh414> @stockballa Thanks for the info.  With something like this do you expect 002 or actual pennies.  I’m a bit of a newbie and trying to manage my expectations
1341379582830764032 2020-12-22 21:46:28 +0800 <bh414> @JuneDaVisionary Been stacking hcmc.  Missed hbrm at bottom. Feels late to the game.
1341374225899278337 2020-12-22 21:25:11 +0800 <bh414> @JuneDaVisionary Looking at when as well.  You in sanp?
1341363796359700482 2020-12-22 20:43:45 +0800 <bh414> @AdnansArk Thinking of moving some sanp over to atmh.  Did you have any opinion on sanp Price target?  I had hope for .0025 or more this week.
1341197136986292231 2020-12-22 09:41:30 +0800 <bh414> @LordStocksPicks Sounds great.  How do we get signed up for the texts?
1340691329102262274 2020-12-21 00:11:36 +0800 <bh414> @AdnansArk Good tip.  When you (and others) say load up, does that mean 10 million to 20 million?  As a newbie I had thought 3 million was huge.  Thinking 10 mil+ is how millions get made with patience.  Also seems you bail all or large part before ever hitting a penny.  New mindset 4 newb
1340329071885119489 2020-12-20 00:12:07 +0800 <bh414> @AdnansArk @yatesinvesting Does anyone think other crypto coins can increase at a better rate than Bitcoin? So many to choose from.
1340071156934709254 2020-12-19 07:07:15 +0800 <bh414> @GeniusTrader777 Thanks.  Very true and would be very stabilizing.
1339680563205189633 2020-12-18 05:15:10 +0800 <bh414> @GeniusTrader777 Is there still an assumed RS on Bayp?
1339670852971999251 2020-12-18 04:36:35 +0800 <bh414> @GeniusTrader777 @acoste22 Hey.  Great info.   Do you still feel this way?  Thought stop loss was in but it was not and it dropped well over  50% on me.    Also are you in a discord or telegram chat? Always have great DD and explanations for education
1339592335059869699 2020-12-17 23:24:35 +0800 <bh414> @AdnansArk No phun?
1339556481893617665 2020-12-17 21:02:07 +0800 <bh414> @JohnRSpano1 If I missed the aegis buy in would you still grab it or just double up UNGS? Great work
1339387772310831104 2020-12-17 09:51:44 +0800 <bh414> @TheWizardTrades @DJ_TOBIAS Planning to join your group. Appreciate your input.  How do you hold such 100% confidence?
1339211349583421440 2020-12-16 22:10:41 +0800 <bh414> @FlexOniHub Thanks for all the input.  Does Flex often hold a stock overnight or start fresh each day
1339015213048328192 2020-12-16 09:11:19 +0800 <bh414> @JuneDaVisionary @knovicetrader Have you been successful following that plan with multiple stocks.  Seems like an awesome plan
1338882536177590276 2020-12-16 00:24:06 +0800 <bh414> @FlexOniHub So park means to cash out? Forgive the ignorance
1338138689407430657 2020-12-13 23:08:19 +0800 <bh414> @PulteDaily Kind of you to give.  Keep going
1337149411638521856 2020-12-11 05:37:17 +0800 <bh414> @JohnRSpano1 Great.  In your experience would it maintain a price near .10 or do 98% of these stocks get dumped by us, once price target achieved
1337144621697273863 2020-12-11 05:18:15 +0800 <bh414> @JohnRSpano1 Thank you.   Sorry they fell today but looking forward to the learning experience, as this scenario is what happens most often when trading on my own.  Not proficient at navigating the loss prevention/exit.   Thank you
1336368930160566278 2020-12-09 01:55:56 +0800 <bh414> @HomelssMillionr Thanks for this alert.  Are you feeling good about the .10-.20 range.  I ask as a newbie and seeing others claiming the Oustanding shares are much higher now.  Great job!  I buy many of your alerts.  Thank you
1334952110144819200 2020-12-05 04:05:59 +0800 <bh414> @AlexDelarge6553 @bhatia_shitij Wow.  From 2 years ago?? Patience you have.

1332704182269321218 2020-11-28 23:13:32 +0800 <bh414> @AlexDelarge6553 Very helpful to hear your opinions on when to hold and when a stock has reached its life.  SUTI PUGE etc.  as beginner reading charts and gaining input can be challenging when deciding what to hold and for how long.
1332682268972900353 2020-11-28 21:46:27 +0800 <bh414> @AlexDelarge6553 @yatesinvesting Grateful for the help.  Looking forward to it.

1331232095738486786 2020-11-24 21:43:59 +0800 <bh414> As Katt said “the only cabinet Biden will have is the one he keeps his cereal in.  That’ll be full of flakes and nuts too.”
1329845305207119875 2020-11-21 01:53:22 +0800 <bh414> @HomelssMillionr Great What trading platform do you use?  The couple I checked don’t seem to allow the extra digit
1325513729186934786 2020-11-09 03:01:14 +0800 <bh414> I just ate lunch....and Donald Trump is our next President
1325509575517368328 2020-11-09 02:44:44 +0800 <bh414> God making Trump President in His own way will be exciting to watch unfold.  Corruption from every corner uncovered and removed.  Repent or be removed
1325509224491864065 2020-11-09 02:43:20 +0800 <bh414> It is very exciting to have Trump as President for 4 more years.

1320172776846708736 2020-10-25 09:18:12 +0800 <bh414> @Cernovich Does it give you a similar focus as Stimulant without the caffeine? Or is it no “buzz” with clarity
1317603868210089984 2020-10-18 07:10:16 +0800 <bh414> @adamhousley Keep doing the right thing.  You make a difference.
