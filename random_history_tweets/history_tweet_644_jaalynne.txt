1343602303035723777 2020-12-29 00:58:46 +0800 <jaalynne> Here are trumps &amp; the GOP accomplishments for the last 4 years.
1343566790341890048 2020-12-28 22:37:39 +0800 <jaalynne> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Why don't all of Congress give up their healthcare and paychecks.   I want to see you guys live on $1800 for 9 months.   Go f@*k yourself.
1343324121497808897 2020-12-28 06:33:22 +0800 <jaalynne> This is what @SenTedCruz   was pushing for with the PPP loans. Not helping small businesses. We need to #RetireCruz   https://t.co/RQ9yRNcbQU
1343219586653708290 2020-12-27 23:37:59 +0800 <jaalynne> Must be nice to earn an income paid by the American people while withholding financial aid to the American people.  #RepublicansDontCare
1343218709184323584 2020-12-27 23:34:30 +0800 <jaalynne> #DerangedDon  needs to go to prison.
1342969674523414529 2020-12-27 07:04:56 +0800 <jaalynne> I can't wait for #DopeyDon  is locked up
1342930309436887044 2020-12-27 04:28:30 +0800 <jaalynne> @Bill_Maxwell_ A galaxy far far away
1342929736142626818 2020-12-27 04:26:14 +0800 <jaalynne> @J21O I voted for the guy who believes in science
1342883127396593669 2020-12-27 01:21:01 +0800 <jaalynne> @PeekaBLUE80 Socks or slippers. I have slippers for my friends when the come to my house. No one gets past the entry way with shoes on. (If there is a medical reason they can have their shoes on)   If I am going to someone else's house I will bring socks/slippers to change into at the door.
1342671235902267395 2020-12-26 11:19:02 +0800 <jaalynne> Wtf is wrong with these fuckers!!
1342667040105095168 2020-12-26 11:02:22 +0800 <jaalynne> @Paul36130834 Nope
1342666841177600000 2020-12-26 11:01:35 +0800 <jaalynne> @Homeoffree61 Yes, we have guns and believe in the 2nd amendment too.   A lot of us are also military, veterans, and in law enforcement.
1342587322957778952 2020-12-26 05:45:36 +0800 <jaalynne> @itsJeffTiedrich That is breathtaking
1342586344116260875 2020-12-26 05:41:43 +0800 <jaalynne> @Baligubadle1 Because the GOP only believes in Corporate Socialism and Socialism for the rich. Not for the average American  Their followers whowould benefit from socialism are to ignorant to see it  They also don't understand that the Fire depart, Police dept, is a form of socialism
1342576954780880899 2020-12-26 05:04:24 +0800 <jaalynne> @Jim_Jordan Your just a wolf in sheep clothing.   Enjoy your Christmas while your constituents are starving, losing their homes, unemployment and lively hood.  Jesus would be ashamed of you.

I am an atheist and I still say Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah or what ever the person I am talking to believes in. It doesn't bother me if someone has a different belief than I do.
1342560889342468096 2020-12-26 04:00:34 +0800 <jaalynne> @KFILE My heart is deeply sorry for your loss! Please remember and treasure the joy she brought to your family and friends
1342559674936266752 2020-12-26 03:55:44 +0800 <jaalynne> @JohnCornyn Must be nice when your constituents are hungry, can't pay their rent, water, electricity and already lost or are losing their unemployment benefits.   Go Fuck yourself
1342437093054799873 2020-12-25 19:48:38 +0800 <jaalynne> @txchristabelle Merry Christmas to you and Nana. Thank you guys for all you do!  https://t.co/g40cGGuEBz
1342244420473786372 2020-12-25 07:03:02 +0800 <jaalynne> @ErrolWebber @laurenboebert If they do, than the are participating in Sedition. According to the 14 amendment section 3 any person who commits Sedition is not eligible to serve in Congress.
1342243636667445248 2020-12-25 06:59:55 +0800 <jaalynne> @laurenboebert Does that mean you are objecting to your election too? If the election was a fraud then that means yours would be invalid too  Can't have it both ways!! You owe it to America &amp; your constituents to not be a traitor and participate in Sedition, which is against the constitution

1341868554694606851 2020-12-24 06:09:28 +0800 <jaalynne> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Fuck you, you traitor.   What the hell does trump have on you
1341773591889797122 2020-12-23 23:52:07 +0800 <jaalynne> @DearAuntCrabby If you had his life, wouldn't you?   Can we please leave him out of it. Teenage years are hard enough, without the world knowing your family is fucked up.
1341772568769028096 2020-12-23 23:48:03 +0800 <jaalynne> @Shaken0Stirred I am so sorry. Sending warm thoughts and wishes your way.

There is a company in Seattle who pays their employees @ the lowest $70k   He says production has went up, sick days have went down  Those are greedy companies being greedy. If ppl refuse to work, they would shut down.
1341750877170884609 2020-12-23 22:21:52 +0800 <jaalynne> @AlexoItz @SenSanders It's called the working poor. In 5 states his comp have the most on SNAP  Anyone working 40 hrs a week should have enough money to live on  It is time for a living wage across the board. CEO pay has grown 940% since '78 Typical workers has risen only 12%    https://t.co/1ZZGKc6ZSw

Gov (Grandparents can die for the economy), and AG actually files lawsuits against the Judges &amp; Mayors who try to do mask/ lockdown  Look how well that is working out. #1 for deaths #2 in cases.

1341699923016871936 2020-12-23 18:59:23 +0800 <jaalynne> @OracleNil Yes, my family does. It is the Pagan Holiday Yule or Yuletide, the winter festival.  To us it's about community giving, enjoying each other's company and spending time w/ friends and family
1341554813893525511 2020-12-23 09:22:47 +0800 <jaalynne> So trump pardons 4 guys who worked for Betsy DeVos brother Erik Prince..
1341527567053053955 2020-12-23 07:34:31 +0800 <jaalynne> @MpTnlu @MixterPamla @Nasty_Mindy @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr You are not listening to what I am saying. I know how the government works, but she refuses to play hardball.   She remained hesitant to file   Like I said in my post, she doesn't use what tools she has.    https://t.co/II4HixPjVd

1341523610159202306 2020-12-23 07:18:47 +0800 <jaalynne> @MpTnlu @MixterPamla @Nasty_Mindy @SpeakerPelosi Pelosi has tools she could of used. She doesn't. She allows the GOP to do whatever they want  She didn't want to impeach trump  According to the 14th amendment section 3 the 126 GOP Reps are participating in Sedition. They are unqualified for office. She is still seating them
1341521092201111552 2020-12-23 07:08:47 +0800 <jaalynne> @SpeakerPelosi This bill is not for us. We are struggling and you don't give a fuck  Thanks for giving our hard earned money to Israel, border wall, defense con, big biz again. Tax breaks for the rich, 3 martinis lunches  You gave it to everyone, but the ones who need it  Fuck you &amp; the GOP

I can tell you she made a lot more working than she did off of UE  The extra UE payments was equal to someone making $15 an hour working a 40 HR week  If they made more off of UE then that tells you something is wrong w/ the wages in the US

1341150078547996675 2020-12-22 06:34:30 +0800 <jaalynne> We get $600 because of the deficit.  Today Congress approved funding for the border wall.   We got fucked by congress

They knew trump probably wouldn't get reelected and a Democrat would be in office. That way they can say, see the Dems raised your taxes.
1340837157087395845 2020-12-21 09:51:04 +0800 <jaalynne> @TMTate4Liberty @CBSNews @brianjsmith195 We want a Democratic Socialism. Like what Europe and Canada have.   Big difference than Socialism like they have in Venezuela.    https://t.co/mhgjKpmkNC
1340834672415260682 2020-12-21 09:41:12 +0800 <jaalynne> We didn't need a study for that. Any working American with a brain could of told us.
1340833407903928326 2020-12-21 09:36:10 +0800 <jaalynne> Retweet this if you need more than $600 a month to cover rent/bills. Let‚Äôs show Congressional leaders how tone deaf this bill really is. This ‚Äústimulus‚Äù bill does not take care of the everyday American, and it‚Äôs not close.
1340827983037272065 2020-12-21 09:14:37 +0800 <jaalynne> @SenSchumer Why don't you guys all forgive your salary and live on a fucking one time payment of $600?  All of you guys have no problem spending money, except when it come to the citizens.   Go fuck yourself along with the GOP and Pelosi.
1340826969819258887 2020-12-21 09:10:35 +0800 <jaalynne> @Scrooched21 @bohemiantoo @jakkiisaid @MysterySolvent @SpeakerPelosi She doesn't play hardball. She gives in every flipping time  She thinks the GOP is like they were 40 yrs ago, willing to work together. They don't  She blames the progressives for losing seats, when the progressives all won their seats without the backing of the moderate Dems.
1340825607685455872 2020-12-21 09:05:10 +0800 <jaalynne> They need term limits and no retirement.   Their pay should be lowered too. The founding fathers never thought that job should be lifelong or full time.
1340824387113672707 2020-12-21 09:00:19 +0800 <jaalynne> Because we are the peasants.   They don't care about us. Hence why we are only getting $600. That will pay about 15 days of rent for a 1 bedroom apt.

She has powers to use, she just doesn't  She didn't want to impeach trump. She has the power not to seat the 126 Republicans that are involved in Sedition  America has change in the last 40 yrs. The est Dems still believe it hasn't
1340819837166206977 2020-12-21 08:42:15 +0800 <jaalynne> Great for memes bad for the American people. She has no backbone!!  Hi, I live in the US where our politicians give us lip service and rather help corporations than the American people.  #PelosiMustGo

He has never shared any of my values and I am sure a lot of other liberals feel the same way.   BTW I can think for myself and don't get my views from the media.
1340778134929633283 2020-12-21 05:56:32 +0800 <jaalynne> @LeeMont2002 @Zis4Zachariah @swon26 @JoeBiden Trumps net worth didn't go down. He used his office to grift off of the American people. He directed business to his properties.   It would of been cheaper for the US if he would of taken his paycheck instead of playing golf. $142 mil instead of $1.6 mil. Education @ it's finest.
1340770571022381056 2020-12-21 05:26:29 +0800 <jaalynne> @AnikoTHomas Because people think it isn't their representative that is the problem.   A poll once showed congress approval rates in their 20's. When the same people were asked if their Representative was doing a horrible job 89% of the respondents said no.
1340651566525722626 2020-12-20 21:33:36 +0800 <jaalynne> @the_real_sunz @BernieSanders Actually all the progressives won their seats without the backing of the establishment Dems  What loss seats was not listening to the younger generation. The ones that in 10 - 20 years will be running the country  The country has changed from 40 yrs ago, but the est Dems haven't
1340650533980409856 2020-12-20 21:29:30 +0800 <jaalynne> @__quack @BernieSanders Say the words: Pelosi is only good for memes.   She backs down every single time.

Not much is spent on anything to improve the way of life for our personal. Meaning housing, base facilities, medical care.   Our military budget is more than the next 13 countries combined. I served 20 yrs.

That means the 1st 3 years of trumps admin economy was Obama's. In Jan &amp; Feb 2020 the econ started to faltered covid just pushed it. Trumps policy was a flop.

1340320817536774146 2020-12-19 23:39:19 +0800 <jaalynne> Dear Georgia, just remember that the people who are trying to take away your healthcare has Gov't paid healthcare.  The 1% is stopping us from getting "Disaster Relief" aka stimulus checks.
1340256350903918592 2020-12-19 19:23:09 +0800 <jaalynne> @robfwtx I did and this is why. The person who abused me as a child didn't care if I was angry at him/her.   I forgave him/her because it was taking a toll on me mentally and physically. Once I let the anger go, I felt better.  Forgiving doesn't mean you have to have a relationship.

Pandemic out of control  The middle class disappearing, while the rich keep getting richer.  A fascist wannabe president who won't acknowledge he lost the election.  The GOP who is complicit.

1326872606004404224 2020-11-12 21:00:56 +0800 <jaalynne> @DinoGodJegs @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Trump didn't stop them from going overseas.

1326865885458477057 2020-11-12 20:34:13 +0800 <jaalynne> @SenRonJohnson Why aren't you investigating Dejoy?   That is who you are describing. He tampered with the mail and interfered with an election.   BTW the Democrats didn't have to cheat. We hate trump that much. If we would of cheated do you think Mcconnell &amp; Graham would of won reelection?
1326863755939082241 2020-11-12 20:25:46 +0800 <jaalynne> @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Just cause he is President doesn't mean he is competent.  The military higher ups can also say that's not a lawful order and refuse.  You should be ashamed of yourself. You helped turned the GOP into the Fascist loving authoritarian party they are today.
1326861775158075392 2020-11-12 20:17:53 +0800 <jaalynne> Except that the establishment Dems are to busy playing nice instead of governing. @SpeakerPelosi   I am tired of them giving into the GOP. They need to get a backbone and do what's right for the American people

1326601152574726145 2020-11-12 03:02:16 +0800 <jaalynne> Unfortunately trumps supporters don't know how to read.  If they did, they would realize the money they are giving for his "legal fight" 60% is going to pay his campaign debt (his pockets) the other 40% to the RNC.

1326582455118262272 2020-11-12 01:47:58 +0800 <jaalynne> @TomiLahren @ConnorEngelbre1 That's why Red states receive more money from the Federal Government than they paid in.   No, lib's usually move to red states because their job transferred there because the Red state gives the corporation tax breaks. Once they end the company leaves.   Stupidity is a disease.

1325404078894161920 2020-11-08 19:45:31 +0800 <jaalynne> @BCOOL333 I am so grateful for a Biden/Harris win. We won the 1st battle, but the war is not over to regain America. Our 2nd &amp; 3rd battle is in Jan in Georgia. We must continue to fight for our voices to be heard.
1325392702490488838 2020-11-08 19:00:19 +0800 <jaalynne> We won the 1st battle. We still have two more to go, otherwise nothing will change. Mcconnell will do what he did to Obama the last 2 yrs of his Presidency and these last 4 yrs.  We need to put all of our strength together and help out Reverend Warnock and Mr Osoff.
1325390890534379521 2020-11-08 18:53:07 +0800 <jaalynne> @Annakhait @realDonaldTrump I don't think God is on the side of a man who broke 8/10 commandments, locked kids in cages, lied about a Pandemic, used the Bible as a photo Op. Raped a 13yr old girl, grabbed women by the Pu$$y. Called our military "Suckers &amp; Losers," Committed Treason and many other crimes
1325387475649441797 2020-11-08 18:39:33 +0800 <jaalynne> There are many of us who would be more than happy to carry out this mission.

That means even the Republican Judges aren't buying his BS.   Here is Judge Diamond in Pa and Trumps lawyers in the argument over observers not being able to watch.  Trump is lying. Open your eyes and do your own research  https://t.co/Vdll0oV8rG
1325377597996457987 2020-11-08 18:00:18 +0800 <jaalynne> This shows us that the GOP doesn't care about our country. They care about staying in power and having control.

He committed Treason &amp; crimes against the US. If we don't stop it and show consequences. It will happen again and we won't be able to stop it next time.
1325239099670794242 2020-11-08 08:49:57 +0800 <jaalynne> Hell no, he needs to pay for his crimes! Along w/ his kids, administration, and senators, and anyone else who enable him and was complicit. I don't care Red or Blue they all need to pay.

Doesn't matter Red or Blue. They committed treason &amp; crimes against the US  Didn't prosecute the Bush Admin for their crimes. Which just emboldened trumps regime

1324724526320701440 2020-11-06 22:45:13 +0800 <jaalynne> First we need to win the Senate in January.   Georgia voters you can do this! We appreciate your voting and it proves if we do vote, we can change things. Let's keep it up to make it the America we want and need
1324723439815561216 2020-11-06 22:40:54 +0800 <jaalynne> Yes, we will
1324721310539390978 2020-11-06 22:32:27 +0800 <jaalynne> @kayleighmcenany Yep God rejected the man who broke 8/10 commandments. Locked kids in cages. Used the Bible as a photo Op. Refused to help Blue states w/ natural disasters. Threw paper towels at Puerto Rican's. Grabbed women by the pu$$y. Raped a 13 yr old. So I would say "God" is in control.
1324719721451786242 2020-11-06 22:26:08 +0800 <jaalynne> @Kristynmazurek @JoyVBehar We should. One of Jared's apartment buildings has filed 100's of evictions in court this week.
1324719077294825472 2020-11-06 22:23:34 +0800 <jaalynne> @MollyDarden @JoyVBehar We actually should revoke his passport. That way he can't leave the US and has to be held accountable for his crimes
1324716433234907137 2020-11-06 22:13:04 +0800 <jaalynne> @GuyLafleur65 Obviously you haven't listen to the younger voters. I have 5 kids under 30. I listen to all their views and their friends views. Times are changing.   If we don't take them in account then the Democrats will not advance if we disenfranchise them. Just saying
1324714839776833536 2020-11-06 22:06:44 +0800 <jaalynne> @HamoodIsWithYM @DecisionDeskHQ @JoeBiden Shut up. The only fraud was committed by the Postal Service and the GOP.   If voting by mail was so fraudulent then why did Trump, Pence and most of his administration vote this way?
1324713469443215360 2020-11-06 22:01:17 +0800 <jaalynne> @GuyLafleur65 @billscher The centeralist dems lost seats. While the prog dems even w/o the backing of the est kept their seats.   We have to open our eyes and realize the GOP is no longer the GOP of the 80's where everyone works together. They are only out for themselves and not the good of the nation.
1324711055705165826 2020-11-06 21:51:42 +0800 <jaalynne> @GregAbbott_TX Texas is still counting votes. Stop lying.   Texas legislature does not truly represent our views. It is not a true Democracy. If it was, it wouldn't have the gerrymandering and voter suppression. It would have a system in place that would allow all eligible voters to vote.

1324706873937973250 2020-11-06 21:35:05 +0800 <jaalynne> Unfortunately Pence has no backbone.
1324705174561132545 2020-11-06 21:28:20 +0800 <jaalynne> @fletchthecommie I took a religion class in college. I was also Catholic and saw how the Priest Molestation scandal was covered up. Then while in the military our priest told us to vote and pray for Bush &amp; Cheney reelection. Then I started noticing all the hypocrisy of "Christians"

1324703047667376128 2020-11-06 21:19:53 +0800 <jaalynne> This administration and some Senators need to go to prison after this election is finished.

Why then, have both Presidential Polls involving a Trump election been so off?  Does anyone else see something wrong with this?

Then their wives who are also uneducated and can't think for themselves. I see it everyday in TX. I also saw it with my family in the Midwest who are farmers.  This is why an education is important.

If churches want to be involved in politics they shouldn't pay no taxes.

1321249160583127041 2020-10-28 08:35:22 +0800 <jaalynne> @MalcolmYates11 @thejtlewis Trump doesn't have charisma. It's called a love of Racism which he shares w/ his followers. It's a shame that trump doesn't care about the American people. His administration is right now is in court to undo peoples healthcare, with no replacement.

The Dems should expand to 12 SCJ. That way it will be 1 to 1. We should also remove any judge that was appointed even though they were deemed unqualified.

1317499632142831616 2020-10-18 00:16:04 +0800 <jaalynne> @Freddyvolpe @RealFredBJones @NancyParks8 @nes_nathan @Amy_Siskind @SohrabAhmari Why is it wrong to ask for proof? You know FACTS. There is proof the SDNY is investigating Trump for tax fraud. I believe in facts not conspiracy theories.
1317498720531877888 2020-10-18 00:12:27 +0800 <jaalynne> I don't want him to flee the US. I rather he be held accountable for his crimes and wear Prison Orange   Vote #BidenHarris2020
1317497159235768322 2020-10-18 00:06:15 +0800 <jaalynne> @RealFredBJones @Freddyvolpe @NancyParks8 @nes_nathan @Amy_Siskind @SohrabAhmari Lol. Where is the proof? Who put this out, the corrupt AG Barr? You really need to stop drinking the orange kool aid.
1317496517268140032 2020-10-18 00:03:42 +0800 <jaalynne> @GOPChairwoman You are a liar just like your Uncle Mitt.  Biden said that he was raising taxes on the 18% who make over 400k a year, not under. We know that the trump cult is to ignorant to know when they are being lied to. The rest of America can't wait till trump is wearing Prison Orange.
1317491835799961601 2020-10-17 23:45:06 +0800 <jaalynne> @chipfranklin @JoeBiden My mother is one of the 18%, she said she doesn't mind paying more and voted for Biden.
1317331875371786240 2020-10-17 13:09:28 +0800 <jaalynne> Trump Makes Last-Ditch Play to Reclaim Seniors Promising to protect Medicare and SS and to distribute a virus vaccine to nursing homes for free.  Don't believe him or the GOP on Medicare or SS. They try to cut them every chance they get! Vac are also free under The ACA and Part D
1317309129870864384 2020-10-17 11:39:05 +0800 <jaalynne> @M_Quintilian @jonfavs Probably taking the high road. Figures why give trump &amp; Co the satisfaction.  If Biden addressed all the lies that trump &amp; Co says, he would never address the real issue.
1317306459336527874 2020-10-17 11:28:28 +0800 <jaalynne> @M_Quintilian @jonfavs Sure it is. This "news" story got the FBI involved, but not how the Trump administration wanted it. The FBI is now investigating Giuliani. I guess that's karma.
1317275006687047680 2020-10-17 09:23:30 +0800 <jaalynne> Anyone notice how quite the Trump campaign is on the town hall ratings?
1317225288535732224 2020-10-17 06:05:56 +0800 <jaalynne> @funder My pre-existing health is covered. Military service is respected &amp; not being called "losers &amp; suckers". Women are not disrespected and treated like objects. People making over $400k a year pays their fair share of taxes. We don't have a scandal every day! #JoeBidensNeighborhood
1317194992973090816 2020-10-17 04:05:33 +0800 <jaalynne> @NRA I guess the musket is making a comeback.
1317194460640391169 2020-10-17 04:03:26 +0800 <jaalynne> @davidmweissman I guess the NRA is saying we need muskets again.
1317178695568691200 2020-10-17 03:00:47 +0800 <jaalynne> @DonaldJTrumpJr Quit ur Bitchin, your daddy could of participated in a debate and refused too. Btw he looks really unstable, you might want to have a mental health professional exam him.  https://t.co/GOiUhjoVfl

1317115257240735744 2020-10-16 22:48:42 +0800 <jaalynne> I would love to have "Mr. Rogers" as President. I can't make it four more years of "Buffalo Bill"
1316964019002068992 2020-10-16 12:47:44 +0800 <jaalynne> @Freddyvolpe @NancyParks8 @nes_nathan @Amy_Siskind @SohrabAhmari Yes, the SDNY already put out trump is being investigated for tax fraud. Why do you think trump keeps fighting to not turn over his tax records? Education and researching for yourself does wonders for your brain. Trump is a con man.
1316962549972303874 2020-10-16 12:41:54 +0800 <jaalynne> @SohrabAhmari Lol, printing lies is not JOURNALISM, that is called trash. Why don't you report the corruption of this Administration? Stop being the Murdoch's b!+ch.
1316930727196446723 2020-10-16 10:35:27 +0800 <jaalynne> @ddale8 Not all states got the money and it only lasted a couple of weeks. Not nearly enough help that the US citizens need.
1316924598177452040 2020-10-16 10:11:06 +0800 <jaalynne> @MollyJongFast Damn! I need to get some of those drugs that trumps campaign is on üíä
1316921345633026048 2020-10-16 09:58:10 +0800 <jaalynne> What?? Just more talking in circles!! If they repeal it, we will lose coverage!! Don't believe Pinocchio our lives depend on it!
1316919614492868609 2020-10-16 09:51:17 +0800 <jaalynne> Trump: You don't ask Biden if he denounces ANTIFA.  Why would Biden denounce ANTIFA? Antifa means Anti Fascism. You know against Fascism.   News Flash @realDonaldTrump if you are against ANTIFA that means YOU SUPPORT FASCISM! #TrumpCrimeFamily #TrumpIsNotAmerica

1316911162198544384 2020-10-16 09:17:42 +0800 <jaalynne> @DanRather Biden, he is doing awesome! Very professional. Listening attentively and responding with clear concise answers.

1316831167069343744 2020-10-16 03:59:50 +0800 <jaalynne> Trump just admitted to ordering a killing of a US protester in Portland, Or. WTH are we a FASCIST country?

Ginsburg only followed that rule if she HAD no predetermined opinion. Barrett had an opinion. RBG answer on abortion during her confirmation.  https://t.co/vei3oI8iNd
1316738618891800576 2020-10-15 21:52:05 +0800 <jaalynne> I think when Biden is being sworn in, the SDNY should simultaneously arrest Trump &amp; Co. That way they can't flee. #TrumpCrimeFamily

1316723267923656706 2020-10-15 20:51:05 +0800 <jaalynne> @bluemangos @danpreston @funder Those reports were already deemed false. Hence why Barr isn't arresting anyone.
1316548653545263105 2020-10-15 09:17:13 +0800 <jaalynne> This is why we need to flip the Senate.
1316532238993911809 2020-10-15 08:12:00 +0800 <jaalynne> @Scottcrates @electroboyusa I am so sorry for your lost.
1316524173942943745 2020-10-15 07:39:57 +0800 <jaalynne> WTF!! Did he forget that he needs the Seniors vote.
1316522325198606337 2020-10-15 07:32:36 +0800 <jaalynne> @AmericanCente14 @KamalaHarris Except some of those questions she refused/didn't know the answer to, were basic questions that you learn in HS Government class. They weren't asking her to rule on a case. I mean she didn't know the 5 protections in the 1st amendment.
1316518078788759552 2020-10-15 07:15:44 +0800 <jaalynne> @FrankieSaysNews @davidmweissman Well this year, hopefully the jokes on them. Thanks to trump mishandling Covid it gives people that normally wouldn't be able to take off to vote, the time to VOTE THEM OUT.
1316517398342557697 2020-10-15 07:13:02 +0800 <jaalynne> @Daunting_1 @davidmweissman And if you live in TX where public transportation isn't everywhere, you can't get to those polling places.
1316516945378729984 2020-10-15 07:11:14 +0800 <jaalynne> @davidmweissman Yes, this happens every election in heavily populated Minority and poor areas. Nothing like good ole voter suppression!
1316508496163041280 2020-10-15 06:37:39 +0800 <jaalynne> @Scottcrates @mommamia1217 Holy shit! I need to know what kind of drugs this person was smoking when they wrote this üò≥üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
1316483353369931776 2020-10-15 04:57:45 +0800 <jaalynne> @JamesKosur Wait, I thought his father said kids can't catch it. It's unheard of.
1316442283580022784 2020-10-15 02:14:33 +0800 <jaalynne> @IJReilly4 @Welch_tx I feel the same way. We should not be used as props, then when no one is looking, they vote against bills that will help the military personnel and Vets. Voting for military spending doesn't help us. It helps the contractors, buys more weapons &amp; planes.
1316439086857478144 2020-10-15 02:01:51 +0800 <jaalynne> @AynRandPaulRyan @davidmweissman @bia31star This is insane. She was a "Professor" and taught law. I was taught in HS US Government class.

1316366211567874048 2020-10-14 21:12:16 +0800 <jaalynne> @jedimindpimp81 @JSEveret @SonRanto Except Obama would have taken precautions not to catch it. Trump knew it was dangerous and choose not to protect himself. How do we know he knew it was dangerous, he made his rally attendees sign waivers not to sue.
1316359763798626304 2020-10-14 20:46:39 +0800 <jaalynne> @JonathanFalcons @kylegriffin1 You wish, but you forgot that Abbott courted businesses from Ca to move to Texas. Guess what that means? Yep, a lot of those companies people transferred into Tx and we all know Ca is full of Dems. Many of my friends are those Dems. üò≥üòÅüòÖüòÇ TX did it to themselves.
1316157279700303873 2020-10-14 07:22:03 +0800 <jaalynne> @Glow_Exquisite @TalbertSwan @realDonaldTrump He has been ordered to give DNA evidence. He has refused and is fighting it in court. If I was him and DNA would clear me, I would be giving it. There are also video tapes too.
1316156712588472322 2020-10-14 07:19:47 +0800 <jaalynne> @McFaul @devaney_robin Don't forget they are for the life of a fetus, but not helping that child once born. They are also for the death penalty. So it's not okay to kill something that can't live outside it's host, but it's okay to kill someone that is breathing. Oh and 220k &amp; counting covid deaths.
1316155266719596545 2020-10-14 07:14:03 +0800 <jaalynne> @Glow_Exquisite @TalbertSwan @realDonaldTrump So let's just keep on ignoring Trump's crimes in the name of GOD?  Maybe if it's 1 but it's a lot and and a pattern.
1316153470613811200 2020-10-14 07:06:55 +0800 <jaalynne> @Glow_Exquisite @TalbertSwan @realDonaldTrump Here's some more facts. The application of a 13 yr old girl's restraining order against trump for him raping her.  https://t.co/6kSf2MDRuz
1316066679986679813 2020-10-14 01:22:02 +0800 <jaalynne> @RIPEdith @PolitiKurd Don't forget if a women becomes pregnant or has an orgasm during the act, she wasn't raped either.
1316066115756290049 2020-10-14 01:19:47 +0800 <jaalynne> @PolitiKurd Hmm, except the woman that GOP is rushing to put in is against Women's rights. BTW I have daughters and none of them were forced to share a locker room with a transgender person and yes they went to school with transgender people. Your bigotry is showing.
1316046832959590405 2020-10-14 00:03:10 +0800 <jaalynne> @MittRomney News flash! Keith Olbermann is not running nor is he the president. Grow some balls and STAND UP to the Orange Man for the good of the American People and the US.
1316044439274450945 2020-10-13 23:53:39 +0800 <jaalynne> And here is the restraining order against Trump for it.  https://t.co/KGpRhoNPBa
1316043253737615362 2020-10-13 23:48:57 +0800 <jaalynne> @CelerySorbet @chipfranklin Except that a lot of antiabortion groups are against IVF too. They say it's up to god if you get pregnant or not. They just make the narrative to fit their agenda. Sad
1316042573421584384 2020-10-13 23:46:15 +0800 <jaalynne> @chipfranklin Gee, I thought the were against all abortions. Nancy Reagan was against stem cells until Ronald needed it. After he died, then she went back to not giving a shit. Just more GOP hypocrisy. They stand for nothing.
1315820868119920640 2020-10-13 09:05:16 +0800 <jaalynne> @chipfranklin Everything! From the hate spewing to the grifting to the lying to the unfortunate 219k and counting deaths. I could go on but I just want him Evicted from the peoples house!
1315819501561147392 2020-10-13 08:59:50 +0800 <jaalynne> @flyguysmom @GeneMcDonald88 @AmyMcGrathKY Don't forget both of them are corrupt too. Elaine Chao, Aka Mrs. McConnell, Aka DOT Sec was being investigated by an IG that trump fired and McConnell refuses to appoint another one. What are they hiding? McConnell bails out Big Biz but refuses to help the American People.
1315813333589610497 2020-10-13 08:35:20 +0800 <jaalynne> @GeorgeMasonJr1 @Right_NotLeft @JoeBiden I'm not the hypocrite. These are the hypocrite's. February 2016, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said a vote on the next Supreme Court justice shouldn‚Äôt be held during an election year.  https://t.co/M6ac4hspfq
1315809801973055489 2020-10-13 08:21:18 +0800 <jaalynne> @GeorgeMasonJr1 @Tiggersdad2 @Right_NotLeft @JoeBiden His tax returns allows the Govt to know if he could be compromised. Which gee, who does he owe $421 million too? He would of never gotten a Sec clearance owing how much he does and bankruptcy. When I had a gov't Sec clearance just a bankruptcy would get you denied or it pulled.
1315808124993851392 2020-10-13 08:14:38 +0800 <jaalynne> @GeorgeMasonJr1 @Right_NotLeft @JoeBiden Maybe you should tell trump that. BTW here is video of McConnell laughing about not allowing any of Obama's go forward while admitting to stacking the courts.    https://t.co/SQ6rZ71OV6
1315782211489071104 2020-10-13 06:31:39 +0800 <jaalynne> @Right_NotLeft @JoeBiden Obviously you need to change your moniker because you definitely are not right on this subject. Why don't you stop listening to ads and research who has packed the courts. You will learn something.
1315779824913326080 2020-10-13 06:22:10 +0800 <jaalynne> @Right_NotLeft @JoeBiden If you look at history the Dems have appointed 4 SC Justices, where the GOP have put in 15. The last 2 years of Obama's term McConnell refused to sit any of Obama's appointees. Trump has had 200 appointed even though a lot of them were unqualified. Tell me again who's packing?
1315777982309363717 2020-10-13 06:14:51 +0800 <jaalynne> @Senator_Simon @JoeBiden @TwitterSupport Except he didn't lie like trump did. See the difference? Of course not. Fauci himself said what trump did was a lie
1315777264668172290 2020-10-13 06:12:00 +0800 <jaalynne> @MollyJongFast Where is his PCR test? Antigen test doesn't mean he is still not infected.  https://t.co/Ua8hAV35Lf

1315764381855019008 2020-10-13 05:20:49 +0800 <jaalynne> @realDonaldTrump Coming from the liar in chief who is spreading it. Where is your mask? Can't wait till you are EVICTED and wearing PRISON ORANGE.
1315761050478755840 2020-10-13 05:07:34 +0800 <jaalynne> They should be prosecuted. That is tampering with an election.
1315756898629513217 2020-10-13 04:51:04 +0800 <jaalynne> @pasbless @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Pre-existing coverage was put in by ACA or "Obamacare". Trump is full of smoke and mirrors, they don't have a plan. 12 years and nothing.
1315756100210237440 2020-10-13 04:47:54 +0800 <jaalynne> @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Hmm, why would trump sign a EO on protecting American with pre-existing conds? It is already law under the ACA.  Why don't you tell the truth that this admin has a lawsuit that is to be heard next month by the SC to eliminate cov for pre-existing coverage.   STOP THE LIES!
1315658126322876416 2020-10-12 22:18:35 +0800 <jaalynne> Just goes to show how bad the GOP is about lying. Their base just follows blindly w/out evening reading what their own candidate's put out.
1315648869833744390 2020-10-12 21:41:48 +0800 <jaalynne> @GOP_Ethics Just like they did for Kavanaugh

1315433859521994752 2020-10-12 07:27:26 +0800 <jaalynne> @maddogpac @nprpolitics Don't forget Obama's last 2 years, McConnell refused to seats including a SC Justice.
1315426323515371520 2020-10-12 06:57:29 +0800 <jaalynne> The GOP is so bad at lying. Only 1.8% of Americans make more than 400k. I guess they think we are all stupid like their base üò•

GOP = Corporate Socialism is good, Citizens socialism is bad. Don't believe trickle down econ works either. It has been Proven the rich get richer and the middle class is poorer.
1315400766337609729 2020-10-12 05:15:56 +0800 <jaalynne> @senatemajldr Hmm, why didn't Obama fill any court vacancies his last 2 years in office? Oh yeah you held it up, same with a SC Justice vacancy for 11 months. You are a traitor just like trump. You make up the rules as you go. Can't wait till the GOP lose.
1315250562351460353 2020-10-11 19:19:04 +0800 <jaalynne> @Harriet35824 @kayleighmcenany @JoeBiden Funny, Don't you think Barr and his goons would of press charges if Obama was corrupt. Obama &amp; staff never refused to testify under a subpoena or fired any IG that was investigating him. Tell me again how Obama is the corrupt one? Facts don't lie, educate yourself.
1315040914562260992 2020-10-11 05:26:00 +0800 <jaalynne> @SenatorRomney How come you're not standing up in SUPPORT of the American people against the Fascist we have in the White House? Do what's right for America!
1315020565510598657 2020-10-11 04:05:09 +0800 <jaalynne> Look who the GOP have running for the Senate in Delaware. A self admitted ex drug runner for the Mexican Cartel

It is also reasonable to assume the Debt would go down under Dems. Since 1981, Reagan, the national debt has increased under the GOP. It decreased under two President's. Wanna guess, Clinton &amp; Obama.

1312711640576479232 2020-10-04 19:10:18 +0800 <jaalynne> @turboj67 @DevinNunes Maybe because the treason and incompetence is on the right. Who refuses to testify, obstructs justice? Ask yourself this, if any other Admin acted like this would you still think the same way? Obama? I would because it's about the US not Right or Left. Ebola 4 or Covid 214k

1312447800911642624 2020-10-04 01:41:54 +0800 <jaalynne> @realDonaldTrump Who the fuck wrote this shit! We know it's not trump. He would of said Wuhan Flu or China Virus, not Plague. All the words are spelled correctly and proper punctuation used. If you are going to fake tweet at least make it look real.
1312441320560947201 2020-10-04 01:16:09 +0800 <jaalynne> @TrendingLiberal @JoeBiden Is it negative if it's the truth?
1312438578429878275 2020-10-04 01:05:15 +0800 <jaalynne> @AmyTambone @CaslerNoel Nope
1312438162879250432 2020-10-04 01:03:36 +0800 <jaalynne> @nancylualb @CaslerNoel Wait, he can't play golf at the hospital.
1312432488636063744 2020-10-04 00:41:03 +0800 <jaalynne> @Winelover3384 @TeaPainUSA I see the racism is still live and well. How exactly is a donation helping him get better? He will not have any medical bills, thanks to us tax payers.
1312431522092216322 2020-10-04 00:37:13 +0800 <jaalynne> @TeaPainUSA He's not tweeting either. Silence, no misinformation aka LYING.   Hope he is enjoying the free healthcare while his administration is fighting in court to take away ours.
1312378263314944000 2020-10-03 21:05:35 +0800 <jaalynne> @GOPLeader @SenateGOP @HouseGOP  Quit lying to the American People!  Fact check: Republicans, not Democrats, eliminated the Senate filibuster on Supreme Court nominees EVERYONE needs to educate yourself. Quit being a puppet for these people who don't care about us.
1312353656360955905 2020-10-03 19:27:48 +0800 <jaalynne> @kevinreed70 @Kandid61Kandi @PressSec @realDonaldTrump I can tell you what kind of care the President and Congress receive at Walter Reed Hosp. They have a ward that is called the VIP ward. The Dr's and Specialists are the best in the world. No average person care comes close to this. How do I know? My husband worked on that ward.
1312351216379203584 2020-10-03 19:18:06 +0800 <jaalynne> @TuckerCarlson WTF is wrong with you? Sexual assault is not a choice, has nothing to do with what a person is wearing. Not wearing a mask is a choice trump made. No one ripped the mask off of his face. He is not a victim, he is a product of his own ignorance.
1312189402781679618 2020-10-03 08:35:07 +0800 <jaalynne> @MAGAThing @TimMurtaugh If you watch Biden's speech from MI. he wished the Trumps well. Quit being a tool for people who don't care about us. Education is powerful! Trump &amp; the GOP leadership has mocked this virus and lied to us. Biden took down all negative ads. Not the GOP. Whose the party of morals?
1312187994946764800 2020-10-03 08:29:31 +0800 <jaalynne> @TimMurtaugh Funny, I watched the video. He wished the Trumps well. Quit lying to the AMERICAN PEOPLE! We deserve the truth!!! Don't believe me? Look up the video yourself. Education is powerful. Quit being a puppet.
1312178846611857409 2020-10-03 07:53:10 +0800 <jaalynne> @SenatorRomney @senatemajldr. These are the lies that the GOP are pushing about the confirmation of Judges. Don't believe me, fact check it! Education is power, quit being the GOP puppets.  https://t.co/CZMfEucz21
1312177749830717440 2020-10-03 07:48:49 +0800 <jaalynne> @AndrewSolender @JoeBiden @TimMurtaugh They are a disgrace! We need to keep exposing the GOP for what they are. Vote because our life depends on it!
1312176300795162624 2020-10-03 07:43:03 +0800 <jaalynne> @tedcruz This is how the GOP is lying to the American People about the confirmation of Judges in the US. Don't believe it. Research for yourself. Education is powerful!  https://t.co/CZMfEucz21
1312175356430827521 2020-10-03 07:39:18 +0800 <jaalynne> @LindseyGrahamSC This sums up how you the GOP lies about the appointments of Judges. Check the facts if you don't believe it. Education is power!  https://t.co/CZMfEucz21
1312155237487054849 2020-10-03 06:19:21 +0800 <jaalynne> @maxwelltani He didn't do it for us. He is selfish and didn't want to admit he screwed up the Covid-19 response. He has lied about it since day 1. Remember it is just a Hoax, it will go away.
1312143681994981377 2020-10-03 05:33:26 +0800 <jaalynne> I wonder if Trump will pray on his death bed? Will he accept Jesus?
1312142841993256960 2020-10-03 05:30:06 +0800 <jaalynne> @MeidasTouch Whoever was running it before. Trump hasn't tweeted all day.   If trump is incapacitated it will go to Pence.
1312138775112212480 2020-10-03 05:13:57 +0800 <jaalynne> @simonbowthorpe @DrEricDing @BillNigh @VP Please take a Civics class. Trump isn't dead. If he is incapacitated The VP takes over the duties. If the VP gets sick then Nancy Pelosi takes over. Pence only picks a VP if he becomes the President because Trump died.
1312131151125868547 2020-10-03 04:43:39 +0800 <jaalynne> @the_ericyates @bayoublugrass @JS1fontes I had a miscarriage/spontaneous abortion at 20 wks. Should I get prosecuted because my body couldn't carry to term? Is that murder? Both of the twins died. Besides we leave in the US. Separation of Church and State.
1312129864376352769 2020-10-03 04:38:32 +0800 <jaalynne> @the_ericyates @bayoublugrass @JS1fontes Late term abortion after 21 weeks can only be performed in a hospital with a surgical center. It can only be if there is something wrong w/ the baby and or the mother's life is at risk. It is very rare to have one. You do know a miscarriage is called an abortion, right.
1312128144371937280 2020-10-03 04:31:42 +0800 <jaalynne> @the_ericyates @johnmlester @AngrierWHStaff The righteous right supports a man that has done NOTHING to stop over 212k deaths. Has a court case for raping a 13 yr girl and another where there is DNA evidence. He is ordered to give a DNA test, but refused. Has paid for abortions, Broken 8/10 Commandments.
1312117245347209216 2020-10-03 03:48:23 +0800 <jaalynne> @funder This is insane! We need a real President and administration. Vote Biden/Harris
1312116382545321985 2020-10-03 03:44:58 +0800 <jaalynne> @mmpadellan My husband and I were leaving our terminal at 2:09 am. We said Karma, then wondered if it was really true. Then thought that it still won't make this heartless man have any compassion or sympathy for our fellow Americans.#COVIDcaughtTrump?
1312103964981092352 2020-10-03 02:55:37 +0800 <jaalynne> @HJWallEcon @SenDuckworth Saying "we have plenty of Catholics" is not the same as saying "we already have enough Catholics". I see you just want to argue and twist my words. Good bye
1312086816074334209 2020-10-03 01:47:29 +0800 <jaalynne> @KathleenSR1952 @duty2warn People who have an undetectable viral load of HIV (0% of spreading) are still prosecuted for having sex and not informing their partners. What trump and his campaign did is worse.
1312081656468000768 2020-10-03 01:26:58 +0800 <jaalynne> @HJWallEcon @SenDuckworth Don't put words in my mouth I didn't say.
1312081053838794753 2020-10-03 01:24:35 +0800 <jaalynne> @HJWallEcon @SenDuckworth I was pointing out when stating "we have plenty of SC Justices that are Catholic" as why we are not oppose to her for being Catholic. I am oppose to her because of her extreme views.
1312080143947427840 2020-10-03 01:20:58 +0800 <jaalynne> @HJWallEcon @SenDuckworth As what our Constitution calls for
1312079805269995521 2020-10-03 01:19:37 +0800 <jaalynne> @HJWallEcon @SenDuckworth I have never said I was against Catholics on the supreme court. I said it was important to know the background, since she belongs to an extreme sect of the church. I don't care what religion anyone is. As a former Catholic and now agnostic. I am for separation of church and state
1312060202540167168 2020-10-03 00:01:43 +0800 <jaalynne> @GOPLeader Hmm, why was it again that you didn't vote on President Obama's in 2016? Don't say because the senate and President wasn't of the same party. During Reagan's presidency a Democratic Senate Confirmed SC Justice Kennedy.
1312059385456156674 2020-10-02 23:58:29 +0800 <jaalynne> @GOPLeader This is how trump acts when someone gets ill. Stop asking is to unite because he is ill. He showed no concern for the American people when he lied to us about Covid-19  https://t.co/vbhO2AsLet
1312057552398544898 2020-10-02 23:51:11 +0800 <jaalynne> @GOPLeader Do not tell us this is the time to unite and come together because trump is ill w/ the virus he denied, lied about, and had no regards towards US. He is everything a true American isn't. He is a RACIST, Criminal, Bully, Rapist, TAX Cheat, liar, and a grifter.
1312053694012092418 2020-10-02 23:35:52 +0800 <jaalynne> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP Where was your disgust when the Honorable RGB passed away and McConnell was immediately stating that the senate would vote to replace her ASAP? That is what is shameful
1312050596292120576 2020-10-02 23:23:33 +0800 <jaalynne> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP Wait, I thought it was a hoax or it would just simply go away. Where is your sympathy for children locked in cages, people who died because of his lies, lost their jobs and no insurance? Which BTW where is a stimulus package to help all of these people?
1312049454891978754 2020-10-02 23:19:01 +0800 <jaalynne> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP Where was your outrage when he attacked Hillary when she caught Pneumonia? That is what is truly shameful.
1312048926942404610 2020-10-02 23:16:55 +0800 <jaalynne> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP I'm disgusted that your a man of no morals. Pushing through a SC Justice during an election year, when you denied Obama the same opportunity in 2016.
1312036474456469507 2020-10-02 22:27:26 +0800 <jaalynne> @IllinoisOpen @1x10e6 @HJWallEcon @SenDuckworth My parrish priest told me that it was against Catholic teachings to do IVF. He said it was God's will if I got pregnant or not. I then responded to him "God gave Dr's the knowledge and tools to help me get pregnant"  He still said nope. My husband and I left and never went back.
1312023032181911559 2020-10-02 21:34:01 +0800 <jaalynne> @GordonBombay7 @HJWallEcon @SenDuckworth Yeah that's it. It couldn't be that they don't want people to see what her beliefs are. We all know personal beliefs shape who we are. I'm just saying why hide what you believe. My Gparents were extreme Catholics and they didn't hide it, and yes it shaped their views.
1312018022752677888 2020-10-02 21:14:07 +0800 <jaalynne> @WatsUpDoc6 @kiaraaknox @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @POTUS You actually inferred it, when you said, I know seven people who had it and recovered and according to the MSM they all should have died. That tells me you only watch FOX or OAN news, because the MSM hasn't said everyone who catches dies. They said it's deadlier than the flu.
1312010218826395649 2020-10-02 20:43:06 +0800 <jaalynne> @IllinoisOpen @1x10e6 @HJWallEcon @SenDuckworth Not true. This is from the Catholic church saying it is against IVF  https://t.co/MHN4PlSian
1312007179138809864 2020-10-02 20:31:02 +0800 <jaalynne> It will be nice to have a President where there isn't chaos every flipping day!
1312006363950669824 2020-10-02 20:27:47 +0800 <jaalynne> @1x10e6 @HJWallEcon @SenDuckworth This was one of the reasons my husband and I left the Catholic church. Can't use IVF but it's okay to molest boys.
1312005554424803328 2020-10-02 20:24:34 +0800 <jaalynne> @HJWallEcon @SenDuckworth You need to Do better research. If her sect of The catholic church is not extreme, then why are they scrubbing her from their websites? We have plenty of SC Justices that are Catholic.  https://t.co/Hw0TnS5gxS
1311966795843080193 2020-10-02 17:50:33 +0800 <jaalynne> @hrafnkat @donwinslow I am usually a compassionate person, but all the info about trump has to come out. He has damage the US more than any president of the US. BTW his cult already thinks of us as evil.
1311836519095701504 2020-10-02 09:12:53 +0800 <jaalynne> @Sheri46522053 @joshdcaplan If you weren't blinded by the racism you share with your cult, you would see that they are all lies. When you have 50 news stations reporting one thing and Fox and Oan news saying something else you have to wonder. Just because trump says it's fake, doesn't mean it's not true.
1311834575878856704 2020-10-02 09:05:10 +0800 <jaalynne> @joshdcaplan @Loverboy7771 What took them so long?
1311834434899910656 2020-10-02 09:04:36 +0800 <jaalynne> He needs to be impeached and removed from office. If he has committed any criminal crimes he should prosecuted for those too.
1311831794732265472 2020-10-02 08:54:07 +0800 <jaalynne> Looks like the whole GOP party is the party of RACISM and NO INTEGRITY
1311811811075788800 2020-10-02 07:34:42 +0800 <jaalynne> This is after they have Gerrymandered the state. You would think that would of been enough, but what do you expect they gave us @JohnCornyn @tedcruz. That's why as a Texan I will be voting Straight BLUE.
1311801332538327040 2020-10-02 06:53:04 +0800 <jaalynne> @PSadistisch @maple_vine @mmpadellan They do have members who are white supremacist.  Good bye, I am blocking your dumb ass

1311799401073963010 2020-10-02 06:45:23 +0800 <jaalynne> @PSadistisch @maple_vine @mmpadellan Who the FBI and Homeland Security use to follow hate groups/domestic terrorist. Like I said, you need to go educate yourself. You think you know a lot, and you just talk shit.
1311798868007284736 2020-10-02 06:43:16 +0800 <jaalynne> @maple_vine @PSadistisch @mmpadellan Yes, they are classified as a general hate group.
1311798242380709888 2020-10-02 06:40:47 +0800 <jaalynne> @PSadistisch @maple_vine @mmpadellan The southern poverty law center who is in charge of hate groups list them. You just proved how ignorant you are. An education is a valuable thing.
1311797570851627008 2020-10-02 06:38:07 +0800 <jaalynne> @PSadistisch @maple_vine @mmpadellan Wrong again. They are designated as a hate group. I will no longer be replying to you, since you just keep pulling shit out of your ass.  https://t.co/6nNtmVu9zd

1311784266477387777 2020-10-02 05:45:15 +0800 <jaalynne> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Just more corruption from the GOP. I guess his words don't mean anything. They don't care about the constitution or the American people. Their only objective is power at any cost
1311768299894571008 2020-10-02 04:41:48 +0800 <jaalynne> Just another day for the  RACIST GOP . Reminds me need to go donate again to @harrisonjaime

1311764060204015617 2020-10-02 04:24:58 +0800 <jaalynne> @PSadistisch @maple_vine @mmpadellan There has been multiple sources, even Fox news has put it out, that he said it. Judge Andrew Napolitano has even said it was true, and he is friends with the president.
1311761516345999360 2020-10-02 04:14:51 +0800 <jaalynne> @PSadistisch @maple_vine @mmpadellan Your ignorant and uneducated. Even with proof you ignore the truth. Keep following the bone spur cheeto right in the Fascist country he is turning us into.
1311760192732684288 2020-10-02 04:09:35 +0800 <jaalynne> @PSadistisch @maple_vine @mmpadellan No it wasn't. Even John McCains wife Cindy called him out on. Here is the video it. https://t.co/ZEUY9cQ2ea
1311757813278892032 2020-10-02 04:00:08 +0800 <jaalynne> @PSadistisch @maple_vine @mmpadellan Obviously you haven't seen @votevets. They are all voting for BIDEN. Why would you want a bone spur coward that is in Putin's pocket as a Commander in Chief?  How many days has it been since we found out Russia put bounties on our heads and not one word from trump.
1311756325869682688 2020-10-02 03:54:13 +0800 <jaalynne> @PSadistisch @maple_vine @mmpadellan Mmm, well let's see I'm retired Navy, husband, FIL, son, BIL army. Grandpas both af, cousins and uncles marines. All voting blue.
1311755561466163200 2020-10-02 03:51:11 +0800 <jaalynne> @SamIamSamUaint @grandmagrit Except it came out those ballots that got discarded was because of Trump's lawsuit stating that they had to be returned in a secrecy envelope. It was Proven they were not and that's why they were thrown out. If your going to provide evidence, provide the whole truth.
1311754080969138176 2020-10-02 03:45:18 +0800 <jaalynne> @PSadistisch @maple_vine @mmpadellan A lot of my friends/family that support  BLM/Antifa are Military, Dr's, Attorneys, Bankers, Engineer's, Teachers, Truck driver's, cashiers, Police Officers, Fire Fighters, and postal workers. The couple that vote GOP happen to be unemployed, living off of the system. Just saying
1311748984927477765 2020-10-02 03:25:03 +0800 <jaalynne> @politvidchannel @Loverboy7771 You would think with all the gerrymandering Texas has done, they wouldn't need more voter suppression. As a Texan I will be voting straight Blue this year. We need to stop this madness
1311716357306687489 2020-10-02 01:15:24 +0800 <jaalynne> @josh_wingrove @PressSec This is as bad as when my 7 year old son told me he was going to college at "Palm Harbor" instead of Harvard.
1311715025652912128 2020-10-02 01:10:07 +0800 <jaalynne> @tedcruz You're nickname as lying Ted fits you perfectly. I just read your oped on why a SC Justice should be voted in, unlike in 2016. During the Reagen admin a Dem Senate voted in SC Justice Kennedy. Stop lying to the American People. No Integrity. As a Texan I will vote BLUE
1311674620039184384 2020-10-01 22:29:33 +0800 <jaalynne> They won't because they and their followers are showing us their true beliefs. They are RACIST and okay with RACISM.
1311673698202447872 2020-10-01 22:25:54 +0800 <jaalynne> So sorry for your loss.
1311671871767629824 2020-10-01 22:18:38 +0800 <jaalynne> Dear news outlet we all know trump is racist. What you should be focusing on is what trump said about accepting the election results.

1311506023350370304 2020-10-01 11:19:37 +0800 <jaalynne> @LindseyGrahamSC Just wanted to say: Thanks Lindsey, I just donated to Harrison.  https://t.co/ImNLfmt96x
1311502456061272066 2020-10-01 11:05:26 +0800 <jaalynne> @LindseyGrahamSC Hell no! You spineless piece of crap. What happened to no SC Justice in an election year? You word obviously means nothing. No integrity! I want someone who is honest, compassionate, and cares about the American people. Now I'm making another donation to Harrison!

1311454163033710593 2020-10-01 07:53:32 +0800 <jaalynne> @sean_antrim @JoeBiden What debate were you watching? Biden gave facts, stayed calmed, &amp; focus. While trump was amped up on adderall or something else. Very Unfocused, incoherent at times, and called on a white supremacy group to stand by? Unless you're a racist you should be ashamed trump is our pres.
1311452762832470016 2020-10-01 07:47:58 +0800 <jaalynne> @JoeBiden You were great last night. Trump on the other hand showed us what a racist lunatic he really his.
1311445155505795073 2020-10-01 07:17:45 +0800 <jaalynne> @realDonaldTrump Where are the 300 mil mask that you promise? Department of Health and Human Services, the government now has 87.6 million N95 masks available, far short of the 300 million promised we would have by September.

1311418459658412032 2020-10-01 05:31:40 +0800 <jaalynne> @DanCrenshawTX Bidens want to raise Taxes on people making over $400k, not the middle class. Quit telling partial truths!
1311418032091144192 2020-10-01 05:29:58 +0800 <jaalynne> @DanCrenshawTX Antifa is an ideology against facism,meaning no organization, this is according to our own FBI. The FBI and Chad Wolf both told Congress that the real threat to America is from White Supremacy groups. Quit lying to my fellow Texans and tell the TRUTH!

I rather have a president that tries to unite our country unlike trump who called on the proud boys to stand by. As a Texan and a Vet, this year I will be voting straight blue. Just another "sucker and loser"

1311401403152121856 2020-10-01 04:23:53 +0800 <jaalynne> @oldgoat608 @mmpadellan ??? BLM and Antifa (yes I know Antifa is not an organization) are not designated by the FBI as terrorist groups or domestic threats.

If you look at my reply to you I was nice enough to attach the video of Fox News where they admit bone spurs trump did call our brothers in arms this. Keep believing the man who can't speak without lying.

1311326801587625987 2020-09-30 23:27:27 +0800 <jaalynne> I am actually wanting to see him cry like the little bitch he is. Which he will, because he is a coward.

1311030826105266176 2020-09-30 03:51:21 +0800 <jaalynne> @SMHU14 @votevets Why, he not running for office. Biden just released 22 years of his. Trump won't because he is fraud and cheat. Why do you think he's fought so hard to hide them. He would of never passed a background check.
1311030109130952705 2020-09-30 03:48:30 +0800 <jaalynne> Especially since Biden released 22 years of his

1311023855541145606 2020-09-30 03:23:39 +0800 <jaalynne> @NFL_Kneeler @JohnAnzo @votevets Biden voted for Iraq because of false intelligence pushed by Bush/Cheney. Remember weapons of mass destruction. 9/11. Props? You must be talking about trump. He tries to use us as his personal army. Hence why he had the military parade on the 4th.

Unlike Mr bone spurs "suckers and losers" How many vet's does trump have in his family tree. ZERO. Who passed Veterans Choice? Obama/Biden. Let's drug test Mr. adderall. Why we are at it, let's give him a real lie detector test.

That tells me they Don't research or educate themselves. #2 They see no problem in Trump not releasing his returns, and it doesn't faze them that he committed tax fraud.

Please don't say, trump says it is fake news. Trump likes to sue for slander. Why isn't he threatening that? If it's not true why doesn't he just show his tax returns?

Ask yourself why he has fought so hard not to release his tax records. Follow the courts and educate yourself.  Don't believe political ads. Look and see what he really has done (hint nothing) to what he says.

Among them was $747,622 written off by the Trump Organization, the same amount his daughter Ivanka Trump reported receiving in consulting fees
1310694094163849224 2020-09-29 05:33:18 +0800 <jaalynne> @realDonaldTrump Will you, @realDonaldTrump, agree to do a lie detector test on live TV? Where REAL American people get to ask the questions. If you do I bet @JoeBiden will submit to a drug test.

He paid Ivanka as a consultant, when she was employed by Trump during 2 separate business dealings. That is illegal. He also wrote off personal expenses as a business expense, which again is illegal.
1310675039608504328 2020-09-29 04:17:35 +0800 <jaalynne> @RobertGCart @JoeBiden He broke the law by cheating. He wasn't following the tax codes.
1310650193826717704 2020-09-29 02:38:51 +0800 <jaalynne> Serious question. If trump gets convicted for his crimes, will he lose his pension of $219,200 per year? @SenSanders @RepTedLieu @AOC @SenWarren
1310647219670876161 2020-09-29 02:27:02 +0800 <jaalynne> @RBReich @SophiaBush What also makes me sick is that this grifter will continue to receive Americans Tax payers money after he leaves office. $219,200 per year as a pension.

He hung out with the whores, prostitutes, thieves and murderers.  The Jesus I was taught about was compassionate. Yet, the GOP supports a guy who has broken at least 8 out 10 commandments.
1310566939882926080 2020-09-28 21:08:02 +0800 <jaalynne> @nj_vet @GeorgeTakei There is tons of proof and yet his followers refuse to see it. Jesus could show up and condemn trump, and his followers will be "That's not Jesus, it's fake news" Ask yourself why so many of Trumps people are criminals. He is a con man.
1310565359037173760 2020-09-28 21:01:45 +0800 <jaalynne> @nj_vet @GeorgeTakei Your so clueless. There is tons of proof and yet his followers refuse to see it. Funny how we never heard of Fake News till trump. Hitler did the same thing to the media.

What has he done for the people? The wall Mexico paying for? No. Healthcare? No. Veterans choice? No, Obama. Tax cuts for the rich? Yes. For the working people? No. 209k+ dead.
1310559876867858432 2020-09-28 20:39:58 +0800 <jaalynne> @ananavarro Yet the GOP base loves him. If Jesus showed up and condemned trump. His followers would be "That's not Jesus, that's a fake."
1310558769198190595 2020-09-28 20:35:34 +0800 <jaalynne> If Jesus showed up right now and condemned Trump. The GOP followers would be "that's not Jesus, he's a fake."

1310379375771234304 2020-09-28 08:42:43 +0800 <jaalynne> @JCfromtheChi @PatriotNews8 @BernieSanders He lied about what they were worth on his taxes. There is plenty of evidence supporting this. His niece has paperwork showing this. That's how his family scammed her out of her proper share of her inheritance. He is being sued for this also.
1310378470611005442 2020-09-28 08:39:07 +0800 <jaalynne> @CitizenDoe @SenSchumer We'll see. That's why the DOJ removed Preet Bharara from SDNY. He was investigating Trump before the 2016 elections.
1310372733658820609 2020-09-28 08:16:19 +0800 <jaalynne> @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump We need a law, that anyone who is running for President and VP has to be vetted and pass a background check. They also have to provide their income taxes too. If we would of had this law the grifters would of never been in office.
1310366243656998912 2020-09-28 07:50:32 +0800 <jaalynne> @PatriotNews8 @BernieSanders Undervaluing your properties for tax purposes is fraud. Then he inflated the value of those same properties for loans. Which is bank and wire fraud.
1310364568657506305 2020-09-28 07:43:53 +0800 <jaalynne> @celticpride83 @MatthewsHawk @CitizenDoe @SenSchumer BTW if you are this ignorant you have no right quoting Ben Franklin.

The fed's shutdown trump University and their cancer charity, because they were stealing from it. How many patents has Ivanka got from China?
1310363270084255745 2020-09-28 07:38:43 +0800 <jaalynne> @CitizenDoe @SenSchumer It wasn't the codes. What he did was outside the law. Hence why he has been being investigated by SDNY before he became President. He is a Con Man and always has been.
1310361184907001858 2020-09-28 07:30:26 +0800 <jaalynne> @ProjectLincoln We should have a law that anyone running for President has to be vetted and able to pass a security background check. Along with releasing their tax information.
1310360161639432192 2020-09-28 07:26:22 +0800 <jaalynne> @ananavarro We should chant that anytime he goes out in public.
1310353943315320833 2020-09-28 07:01:39 +0800 <jaalynne> @ProjectLincoln Just think of all the money he has fleeced from the American taxpayers. Charging outrageous amounts for the SS to stay at his resorts.
1310352405322752002 2020-09-28 06:55:33 +0800 <jaalynne> @robreiner He wishes he was as smart as Capone. He is just a coward, that has Bar and others do his dirty work.

Can't wait to see him and fam in handcuffs and jumpsuit orange. Just wish he would go to regular prison &amp; gen pop. I will just have to settle for fed pen.
1310343440606138370 2020-09-28 06:19:55 +0800 <jaalynne> @grottyscotty @ananavarro Don't forget he also paid off prostitutes. He also has 2 court cases going on. One where he raped a 13 yr old,  and the second happened in a dept store dressing room. The 2nd one has DNA evidence that trump is refusing to submit his DNA.

I never said looting and rioting is okay. They are breaking the law and should be punished, but the ones who are protesting should not be injured or arrested. Just like the journalists.

We should all have the right to protest. What about the ones showing up at court houses with assault riffles and hanging effigies? I don't see you upset about them protesting.

More dead than 5 wars put together. Never had a dime of welfare. Married, College educated, raised 5 self sustaining kids. Worked hard and have a great income. I also have a heart and can empathize w/ ppl less fortunate.
1310291932007018497 2020-09-28 02:55:15 +0800 <jaalynne> @marcorubio What attacks on Catholics? Only the GOP is talking about religion. 4 of the sitting SC judges are Catholic. Biden is Catholic. Only your ignorant followers would believe the shit coming out your mouth.

How do we know that? Multiple media outlets showed it. Time to turn off faux &amp; Oan news.

1310273295753908227 2020-09-28 01:41:12 +0800 <jaalynne> @utvolfl In the last 4 years, trump and GOP have done nothing for Americans on health care. Even though they have total power. They have been to court multiple times to take away our coverage, even in the midst of a pandemic.
1310272753895956482 2020-09-28 01:39:02 +0800 <jaalynne> @utvolfl He disrespects our soldiers calling them "losers and suckers"
1310271850929369088 2020-09-28 01:35:27 +0800 <jaalynne> @utvolfl Help minorities how? He spews racial hate. He took away diversity training. He calls the racist "fine group of men and they have great gene's" Even though 93% of the BLM protest are peaceful he calls them "thugs". Covid-19 affects minorities more, over 7mil ill and 207k dead.
1310270771080634369 2020-09-28 01:31:10 +0800 <jaalynne> @utvolfl What has he done? He signed an EO to protect preexisting conditions. While that all ready exist under the ACA. At the same time he is in court to eliminate the ACA provisions that protects our coverage. The veterans choice was put in under Obama. He is all Smoke &amp; Mirrors.

1310216868284821506 2020-09-27 21:56:58 +0800 <jaalynne> @JohnCornyn, You gave me a BS letter regarding your vote for a SC Justice to replace RGB. You didn't apply the same rules with Mr. Obama's pick. You just confirm to me the GOP just cares about power. That is why I am voting straight BLUE this year as a Texan &amp; Vet.

1310022084324659201 2020-09-27 09:02:58 +0800 <jaalynne> @oper102 @otisrex @BernieSanders For someone who claims to love Jesus, it looks like you missed compassion in Sunday school. Just saying
1310020885680709633 2020-09-27 08:58:12 +0800 <jaalynne> @oper102 @otisrex @BernieSanders How do you expect the unemployed to pay just for housing and basic living needs? The working is making more. Their wages plus the 2k a month.
1310017146764898305 2020-09-27 08:43:21 +0800 <jaalynne> @otisrex @BernieSanders No $h!t, the unemployed (becuz of this Prez &amp; Co incompetence) need the help more than the working. I also bet you rather give it to Big Biz, becuz you think the CEO's and shareholders need the money. SMH another person w/ no heart.
1309995155185958912 2020-09-27 07:15:58 +0800 <jaalynne> @LindseyGrahamSC What happened to no SC Justice confirmation during a election yr? Before you say the Senate and Prez is the same party. A Dem senate confirmed Kennedy under a GOP Prez. You have no morals or integrity.
1309957969493319683 2020-09-27 04:48:12 +0800 <jaalynne> Eric Trump: President would concede election 'if he got blown out of the water' by Biden. Let's make this a reality @mmpadellan @SophiaBush

Just look at the 70's compare to now. Then 1 person worked 40 hrs and was able to support a family of four. Now 2 working parents can barely make it working 50 hrs a week.
1309582407310471170 2020-09-26 03:55:51 +0800 <jaalynne> @SenSanders It needs to be a living wage across the board. I am tired of the Rich getting tax breaks. The poor gets help from welfare, but the middle class is struggling too. Ex: I make $15 now, my new pay should $22.75. Then every year we should get Cola raises.
1309508253169180673 2020-09-25 23:01:11 +0800 <jaalynne> @usnews Why write this article and not state it is already a law under the ACA?

1308815486545788928 2020-09-24 01:08:23 +0800 <jaalynne> @LindseyGrahamSC FYI a democratic senate during Reagan elected a SC Justice (Kennedy), while it was an election year. I guess you think your followers are to ignorant to figure out your just a liar.

Have you not seen how this administration is not following science or how they are manipulating numbers. Just look at the CDC. They change on a whim becuz of trump. I know Dr's that say they are signing more death cert from covid than is being reported.

Whereas BLM protest are about inequalities and people dying at the hands of PO. They should have the same rights.  A persons life is way more important than not having to wear a mask.

His reason for not confirming Obama's was because it was a lame duck year and never before had a opposing senate confirmed a SC justice. That was a lie.

1308426059784876033 2020-09-22 23:20:56 +0800 <jaalynne> @SenatorRomney The only "Precedent" you are following is the GOP can't stop lying. A Democratic Senate confirmed Ronald Reagan‚Äôs nominee, Anthony Kennedy, in 1988.

1308418868604530688 2020-09-22 22:52:22 +0800 <jaalynne> @MittRomney You just pull sh#t out of your a$s. A Democratic Senate confirmed Ronald Reagan‚Äôs nominee, Anthony Kennedy, in 1988. I guess you don't care what's right and follow in line with a corrupt administration.
1308109253316694017 2020-09-22 02:22:04 +0800 <jaalynne> @stevennelson10 @MayorBowser New York should just stop sending money to the federal government. They will have a surplus not supporting the Red states.
1306606459791314944 2020-09-17 22:50:30 +0800 <jaalynne> @AllenciaMiguel @SenSanders @yukeleon @SenGillibrand It is not losing money. It has to prefund pensions 75 years in advance thanks to a law from 2006. No other company has to that. Please educate yourself on the postal service.
1305811636188524560 2020-09-15 18:12:09 +0800 <jaalynne> @LindseyGrahamSC @harrisonjaime Oh the hypocrisy. You care about your opponents but not trumps. Please just go away and take the rest of the GOP with you.
1305448818545176581 2020-09-14 18:10:27 +0800 <jaalynne> @3658_1 @GOPChairwoman Funny, we had Ebola and H1N1 under Obama/Biden. They seemed to handled it quite well.
1305448120357203973 2020-09-14 18:07:40 +0800 <jaalynne> @GOPChairwoman Are you really this ignorant? Traitor Trump is president.  The GOP's ignorance hurts my head
1303737070016507904 2020-09-10 00:48:34 +0800 <jaalynne> @shirry23 @tammytabby @cathponeill @JoeBiden Who is the President now? Trump. Where is the law and order? All of this chaos is under him. Trump is a rapist. Look at the court cases against him. BTW I am a rape survivor. Over 190k have died because of Trumps incompetence. How do you think those families feel.
1303736013592899584 2020-09-10 00:44:22 +0800 <jaalynne> @shirry23 @tammytabby @cathponeill @JoeBiden That is a lie. Do some real research. 91% of abortions performed are done before 13 wks. Only 1.3% are performed between 21- 24 wks. (Most of those are due to the mother's or babies health) How many abortions do you think Trump has paid for?
1303605754864136193 2020-09-09 16:06:46 +0800 <jaalynne> @tammytabby @cathponeill @shirry23 @JoeBiden I question why the GOP touts they are God loving but endorses a man who has broken at least 8 of the 10 commandments and uses the Bible as a prop.
1303604913096843265 2020-09-09 16:03:25 +0800 <jaalynne> @cathponeill @JoeBiden Prochoice does not mean you are for abortion. Prochoice means no one should tell a women what to do w/ her body.(Esp old white men on viagra) The GOP coined it proabortion during the '80's to rile up it's base.  GOP less gvt unless it's a women's body üòû
1303417115974799362 2020-09-09 03:37:11 +0800 <jaalynne> @Bishopoftyler As a Catholic are you saying we should support a man who has broken at least 8 of the 10 commandments? Nope, I rather support someone who shows us what a real man is suppose to be. Also, politics has no place in the church &amp; is against the IRS tax code.
1302836142904086528 2020-09-07 13:08:36 +0800 <jaalynne> @Cernovich As a 100% Disabled Veteran I am offended by your statement. Trump does not care about the military. He took away funding for our families for a wall "Mexico was paying for" He uses the military for props and acts like it is his private military.
1302440824106627074 2020-09-06 10:57:45 +0800 <jaalynne> @LovesTravelStop You have 2 male employees at #758 on 9/5/20 @ 2030. That deserve a shout out! They were very helpful, respectful and polite.
