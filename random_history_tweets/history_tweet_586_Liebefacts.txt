Writing down his feelings, talking it out, drawing, walking etc. Needs to express it in someway. Even if it's just baby steps at first. As long as he keeps trying.
1344035292114776065 2020-12-30 05:39:19 +0800 <Liebefacts> @LornaMarieDavid He needs to find out WHAT is giving him the anxiety. He should write in a journal what is bugging him. He can keep the journal private and never show it to anyone. He just needs to "unravel" his anxieties until they are harmless. Support him but don't try to push him.
