So how is that a "descent" on our part? That's a staying in roughly the same position.

I do think some people are born with marginal hormones, problems waiting to happen. In a proper society, that shit is suppressed. They squash it within themselves. In ours? enflamed.

We have to flip that dynamic at some point and use the children of liberals to bolster our ranks (that is already happening, actually - I am one such.)  We need white babies.

1341076525513400320 2020-12-22 01:42:14 +0800 <MioBread> @DeludedShaniqua The truth behind this: a handful of white women have asked to touch in office settings over the years, and we’re trying in an awkward way to convey “oh your hair is so interesting” when they’d never trade their hair for that mess and it’s similar to nice things you say to tards.

1326902950380367876 2020-11-12 23:01:30 +0800 <MioBread> @HarmlessYardDog It's actually really angering to have the experiences of whites across so many cities, neighborhoods, etc. over so many decades - just dismissed. We have seen place after place turn to shit because of other groups. Places we built and had families before, places that were nice.
1326902622339653633 2020-11-12 23:00:12 +0800 <MioBread> @HarmlessYardDog I love this idea that the white people around there just up and decide to think of it as "Tar-Ghetto" for zero reason. As though our real "lived experiences" as whites don't come down to actual criminality taking place, an area actually being run down, etc. What a joke.  https://t.co/AxNdyosJqA

Would you say it is more or less deniable now than ‘16 that we are an irreconcilably racially divided nation? I say more and I say Trump is connected.

They got mad at him for trying to limit their wanton destruction. Like they were trying to destroy things, and they got mad at him for dousing fires and such.  Real POS

And to show up, and they even did her a kindness by knocking and announcing when their warrant allowed to go right in. Sad that her boyfriend made a mistake and started firing.
1308904944662130688 2020-09-24 07:03:51 +0800 <MioBread> @DavidAFrench @MattWalshBlog Based on that image, the warrant application seems completely solid to me. Do you really think it's unreasonable for the girlfriend of a major drug dealer, whose rental car ended up with another drug dealer dead in it, to end up getting an unexpected apartment search???

1308860731857793027 2020-09-24 04:08:10 +0800 <MioBread> @yanniwonka @baptizemyglizzy It's possible that whites benefit from the reputation whites generally have, of being civilized. While blacks may start off in a point deficit because of the reputation that blacks generally have of being violently inclined.  Too bad, I guess. Men also get this vs. females.
1308855158625972226 2020-09-24 03:46:01 +0800 <MioBread> @yanniwonka @baptizemyglizzy Some people who lose their shit, white or black, luck out and get a cop / other person who doesn't end up killing them. A lot do. Some of it is just pure luck. The cop who doesn't have the balls to pull the trigger, cuts you a ton of slack, etc. Calm blacks are very rarely shot.
1308846719359221763 2020-09-24 03:12:29 +0800 <MioBread> @kaimayesmcclain @stillgray Guess which witness said they not only heard a knock, but heard "police, police!"  ...  The one who actually lived closest, right outside Breonna's, and came outside and was told to go back in by the cops.  So a bunch of people who were too far away to hear shit other than gun.
1308839824191782913 2020-09-24 02:45:05 +0800 <MioBread> @baptizemyglizzy Tell me truthfully: are you prepared to deny, or admit, that blacks in the US are far more likely to respond to annoyances / challenges with hair trigger violence than whites are? You people literally joke about how overly polite and restrained whites are / explosive blacks are.

1308836415447461897 2020-09-24 02:31:33 +0800 <MioBread> @baptizemyglizzy When white people exhibit irrational anger toward police or other citizens, when they lash out violently, when they have hair trigger tempers and resort instantly to violence when perturbed, those white people very frequently end up shot too. And I'm glad they do.
1308834949022310402 2020-09-24 02:25:43 +0800 <MioBread> @617to416 @CharlesMBlow I hear black people brag frequently about the same characteristics you're pretending are figments of white imagination. Blacks brag about having a culture of not putting up with anyone talking shit, not backing down, hair trigger instant violent reactions (keeping it real) etc.

For whatever reason, perhaps based on the fact that they saw the TV light on, I don't know. But for whatever reason they determined to knock and announce WHICH THEY FUCKING DID WHICH IS NOT EVEN IN DISPUTE. So YOU shut the fuck up, you're the one bad info.

It was a no knock warrant but before they went in, they did a huddle meeting outside and changed it to a knock warrant. The guy who shot the cop (Breonna's boyfriend) confirms they knocked. The cops confirmed they knocked and announced. The black neighbor too.
1308823923660853255 2020-09-24 01:41:54 +0800 <MioBread> @Shrubbinn @BBCBreaking In what way is it a crime? Officers knocked, announced "police, police!" (confirmed by closest neighbor, a Jamaican guy) then entered and were shot at. Returned fire. I'm missing where the crime took place?

The cops had a legal warrant to investigate a house which had been used for drug dealing. They knocked, announced who they were, and were shot at. Sad for her family? sure.

They are super anti-cop and pro-Breonna, but they still had to confess that the closest neighbor heard "police, police!"

1308527732024901638 2020-09-23 06:04:57 +0800 <MioBread> @lanastanczak Agreed, this is especially true in light of the black community's well known characteristics of: quiet reflection, deep introspection, sober assessment of the facts, forsaking any emotion in making decisions and coming to conclusions, etc.

Of course. Is it treated differently because it's police? Yes... now I want to see if your brain is firing on all cylinders. Explain to ME why it is different. Please.

I'd have the cops go and deliberately slaughter the entire criminal element of our society - but to restrict myself for the moment to what is currently legal, I will say that the cops here did not "murder" anyone, they returned fire when fired upon. Defensive.

We're trying to help you with an intervention here. You grant more agency to whites so you hold them accountable in a way you wouldn't PoC, which is actually appropriate IMO. You're welcome
1308481187694997511 2020-09-23 03:00:00 +0800 <MioBread> @speaknowmp3 @NotRPGTV @skellytrizzon Breonna did more than date criminals, it seems quite clear she was involved in the drug dealing. She rented a car to be used in a drug sale, the drug dealer (friend of her thug bf) was killed in said car. She let him store drug money and drugs at her apartment, etc.
1308480311269961728 2020-09-23 02:56:31 +0800 <MioBread> @speaknowmp3 @NotRPGTV Correct, cops are not the jury but we empower them to use lethal force to preserve the lives of them + other citizens in situations such as, oh, I dunno... someone literally shooting one of them. Not just shooting at, no... they shot one of the cops in the femoral artery.
1308478880206946317 2020-09-23 02:50:50 +0800 <MioBread> @speaknowmp3 @NotRPGTV So "received justice" means cops who did their job going to prison for no reason or?

1308460763384868864 2020-09-23 01:38:50 +0800 <MioBread> @_rightofcenter @stillgray False.  Most of the rioters have been black across the country, both in 2020 and especially in the decades and decades leading up to this year.  This year, we do have a higher level of white rioters than before because of the ascension of antifa, but only in very white cities.

Most said all they heard were gunshots. One neighbor (a black Jamaican man) said he heard knocks AND "police, police!" - guess where he lived? Closest.
1308444041424646147 2020-09-23 00:32:23 +0800 <MioBread> @S1ckSigma @MattWalshBlog One source is actually NYT's recent "The Daily" podcast episode which is heavily, heavily in favor of Breonna. Even in that, they include a clip of the closest neighbor (lived right up the stairs) saying they both knocked and called out "police"
1308442524613304321 2020-09-23 00:26:22 +0800 <MioBread> @S1ckSigma @MattWalshBlog Incorrect.  The shooter / boyfriend of Breonna himself says they knocked. The neighbor closest to their apartment (a black man) says they not only knocked, but said "police, police!"

1308052614571896834 2020-09-21 22:37:00 +0800 <MioBread> @ABusinessMan14 @thisislaurat Very true, and I have no doubt at all that I have plenty of conquerors and enslavers and murderers in my genetic line, like everyone else does. Especially given my appearance, which seems to indicate a lot of "invader DNA" from an Irish perspective, like Germanics of some kind.
1308049924894781442 2020-09-21 22:26:19 +0800 <MioBread> @Myst5575 @thisislaurat True and I have no doubt at all that if you go back in my lineage, there were plenty of people taking things / aggressing upon others as well. It's history / life.

1308047052568326146 2020-09-21 22:14:54 +0800 <MioBread> @thisislaurat I'm of Irish descent, and I was raised to some degree being told about the ways in which the English have wronged our people. Doubtless, it is true.  Regardless, I would not wish to see any harm whatsoever happen to the English now. Especially not the form it is taking. Brothers.

1305626964615524352 2020-09-15 05:58:20 +0800 <MioBread> @stillgray They figure they can be as stupid, reckless, confrontational, and violent as they want and as long as they start acting convincingly like victims and screaming in horror when the obvious / logical / deserved outcome arrives, this somehow changes the dynamic retroactively.

Adopting it because there was a war / famine / plague and both parents died in it, is great and noble and necessary. Offloading his kid because it would really cramp his style, is not honorable or right or good.

It will change your life a ton, and that's fine. That's good. You will one day be telling that child about how you and their mom made it work / figured it out.
