Who can we even trust in the GOP anymore? It seems Pence hasn‚Äôt even been trying to secure a win. Maybe he‚Äôs too risk-averse to fight back, even against his own self-interest.
1338986545978728450 2020-12-16 07:17:24 +0800 <okcon_politics> @RedEaglePatriot Pence has been too silent thus far. I hope he knows that he will destroy his entire career if he votes to certify, be it in 2020 for VP or a 2024 presidential run. If it has to be selfish reasoning that brings him to do the right thing, so be it.

1336696330945748998 2020-12-09 23:36:54 +0800 <okcon_politics> @the_cottonmouth @RealAPolitics I think our opposition to globalism and aggressive foreign policy on the diplomatic front and our populist ideas on the economic front are the easiest to sell to a broad base. And then we can focus on pushing a more traditional social agenda.

Flip AZ. Win GA recount. Find a way to audit 1.5k more votes in WI. He ties the election. PA, NV, MI are all just icing on the cake after that.

1325157466221535233 2020-11-08 03:25:34 +0800 <okcon_politics> Now we know why the media made such a huge deal on whether or not Trump would concede....

1325121497401335813 2020-11-08 01:02:39 +0800 <okcon_politics> I surprisingly have no reaction to the Biden win. Normally there is a feeling of finality every time a race is called. Not this time. Even if the result doesn‚Äôt change, this election isn‚Äôt over.
1324512412108836864 2020-11-06 08:42:21 +0800 <okcon_politics> Sad to say, I think Georgia is done for Trump.
1324185092038795266 2020-11-05 11:01:42 +0800 <okcon_politics> If this election cycle has taught me anything, it‚Äôs how to spot a shy Trump voter. Just had a 30-second conversation with a coworker that I‚Äôm not with often, and she definitely voted Trump.
1323891463818743809 2020-11-04 15:34:56 +0800 <okcon_politics> Worth noting: Arizona has only had 5 more percent reporting since the Fox News call and Biden‚Äôs lead has already diminished by 2 points. If this pace keeps up, Trump wins Arizona by 2.
1323890440391823361 2020-11-04 15:30:52 +0800 <okcon_politics> Twitter is going to censor this Trump speech so badly

1323758209769918464 2020-11-04 06:45:26 +0800 <okcon_politics> I hate to post the same map as 2016, but this map was a tough one. PA very well could flip depending on in-person R turnout, and NV is a potential flip. I think NH could be closer than I predict. OH may be safe. I think MN is another pipe dream, but it will be closer than 2016.

1323479941527293952 2020-11-03 12:19:41 +0800 <okcon_politics> KS/TX on the verge of being safe R. NC is potentially only a tilt. I expect CO and NM to run 2-3 points ahead of Trump (hence the lean). IA could be lean. AZ could move in either direction. I have honestly no idea about ME. Collins and ranked-choice are too unpredictable.

1317127390007595008 2020-10-16 23:36:55 +0800 <okcon_politics> @JoeBiden So an 8 year old is mature enough to make a life altering decision?  If this is the case let‚Äôs change the laws so kids to smoke and drink legally. It is their body, let them do what they want.

So I think a state like PA, FL, or AZ would give us a better idea of how Trump is doing nationally. If he‚Äôs winning (or at least competitive) in those states, he takes the electoral college.
1314672290735386624 2020-10-10 05:01:14 +0800 <okcon_politics> @JJ_McCullough Ohio is moving too far right to be considered a bellwether in this election.

1313131168225734656 2020-10-05 22:57:21 +0800 <okcon_politics> The longer this pandemic goes on, the more people are personally affected by COVID. When everyone knows several people who have had this ‚Äúsuper deadly‚Äù virus and been fine, we stop caring and start taking more risks. They can‚Äôt maintain these shutdowns for much longer.
1312819006722768897 2020-10-05 02:16:56 +0800 <okcon_politics> Are people really surprised that a 74 year old man with a respiratory virus can‚Äôt go 4 minutes without a cough? They‚Äôre so desperate to paint the narrative that Trump is on his death bed.
1312772394226868225 2020-10-04 23:11:43 +0800 <okcon_politics> You know, under normal circumstances I would say that Trump getting COVID was our October surprise, but given the precedent of 2020, I‚Äôm prepared for about 17 more before the election.

1307338373573509127 2020-09-19 23:18:52 +0800 <okcon_politics> He‚Äôs not wrong but.... not the right time.
1306220203672588298 2020-09-16 21:15:39 +0800 <okcon_politics> I (registered R) just got a letter in the mail from my state‚Äôs Democratic Party asking to help out my (endangered) Democrat representative. The only thing I‚Äôm helping out with is getting her a new job in 2021.
1305920816689942529 2020-09-16 01:26:00 +0800 <okcon_politics> I thought this was talking about the House at first and it was ridiculous even then. But the SENATE?! What are they smoking?
1305655970547277826 2020-09-15 07:53:35 +0800 <okcon_politics> @CottoGottfried Pure delusion  https://t.co/kjmBcsTTVw
1305576144834568192 2020-09-15 02:36:24 +0800 <okcon_politics> Our candidates are just old dudes trying to prove that they‚Äôre not senile and can skillfully navigate a ramp
1305156062308425730 2020-09-13 22:47:08 +0800 <okcon_politics> I also can‚Äôt wait to see the meltdown of all my lefty professors/peers following a Trump win, so there‚Äôs that.
1305155698184118273 2020-09-13 22:45:41 +0800 <okcon_politics> I‚Äôm actually so excited to vote for @realDonaldTrump on November 3rd. I was not this enthusiastic even last month. My favorability of the man just keeps growing.
1305146130905399296 2020-09-13 22:07:40 +0800 <okcon_politics> These people are literally justifying murder. This is what happens when you push the false narrative that police are racist degenerates who just go around itching to kill a person of color. Disgusting.
1304899113822158848 2020-09-13 05:46:07 +0800 <okcon_politics> @AmeriGirlTN @FloridaDude297 @realDonaldTrump I keep a note of all most recent Florida Dude polling (to check for accuracy on election night). If all his polling were to hold true, Trump would win with 362-374 electoral votes (WA was a tie in the last poll).
1304877451466747909 2020-09-13 04:20:02 +0800 <okcon_politics> @davidchapman141 Not a good poll for Biden
1303690097477459968 2020-09-09 21:41:55 +0800 <okcon_politics> I‚Äôm now being recommended the 1619 project in class. Welcome to university.
1303132877199204352 2020-09-08 08:47:43 +0800 <okcon_politics> @davidchapman141 I‚Äôm a college student going into a profession where I will be shunned by  my colleagues for saying I support Trump or for expressing conservative ideas. I only have a select few friends who I am willing to be completely open with about my politics.
