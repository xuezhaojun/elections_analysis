Florida DEO, for example,may give $80 per week, if you ever get an answer from the DeSatan‚Äôs agency. The top is $275, and you do the math if your average salary disappeared.

However, from January to mid March, Trump stayed silent while  workers were subjected to the virus via commutes and offices.

1340335477514223619 2020-12-20 00:37:34 +0800 <againsthatred1> @cnnbrk These players who had COVID SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHECKED AND FOLLOWED UP FOR SERIOUS EFFECTS LIKE MYOCARDITIS INSTEAD OF FORCING THEM TO CONTINUE PRACTICING AND PLAYING.

1334567633988050944 2020-12-04 02:38:13 +0800 <againsthatred1> @sandmtnvol @AOC Because she believes people who were struggling with $600 per week Care Act money shouldn‚Äôt be supporting families on $300, which is what greedy Republicans are proposing.  Those average middle class workers were making between $1,000 and $2,000 before COVID hit.

1325349481504780290 2020-11-08 16:08:34 +0800 <againsthatred1> @newtgingrich Trump‚Äôs supporters voted for a man who had zero idea how to be a president and nothing about the government or policy.  He brainwashed them into thinking he was the greatest, thus we have had four years of chaos and destruction coupled with pure nastiness.

If they lied to the America people before, they will lie to them again.  The Hunter Biden conspiracy theories were dismissed.

1316441194499633153 2020-10-15 02:10:13 +0800 <againsthatred1> @senatemajldr You spent zero time finding and vetting the best judges-a person with three years on the bench is not the best and the brightest-then why spent taxpayer money holding this meaningless hearings?  WORK ON A STIMULUS package to help the people who pay you. Giggle giggle.
1316440477340774400 2020-10-15 02:07:22 +0800 <againsthatred1> @funder If McConnell and the Senate are spending zero time vetting the best judges, and these hearings are a done, inappropriate sham, then why are they spending taxpayer money holding them instead of working out a stimulus package???

1316393267806777345 2020-10-14 22:59:47 +0800 <againsthatred1> @Ky_Gill28 The question is why would the people who attended want to hurt their own children and grandchildren by possibly getting COVID, and why would The Villages fail to protect their residents???
1316392840566657024 2020-10-14 22:58:05 +0800 <againsthatred1> @Ky_Gill28 Trump knows he has to win Sumter County big, so he purposely put the lives of all senior citizens at the Villages on the line a few days ago by having Pence hold a mask-less rally with no social distancing.  They clearly know they were putting your lives on the line.

1316361247240204290 2020-10-14 20:52:32 +0800 <againsthatred1> @realDonaldTrump The economy is shattered after four years of TRUMP.

Hopefully they will be quarantined alone away from family at Thanksgiving and Christmas or have a loved one in the hospital they can‚Äôt visit.  Then they can pray for wisdom.
1316122360194490368 2020-10-14 05:03:17 +0800 <againsthatred1> @Redistrict So of course to Trump that was worth potentially killing people.

1316014667068661761 2020-10-13 21:55:21 +0800 <againsthatred1> @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump I really believe people who participate, the venues, and the soon-to-be ex President should be civilly and criminally liable for the resulting sickness and deaths.

1312576665390850054 2020-10-04 10:13:58 +0800 <againsthatred1> @CNNPolitics @cnnbrk I heard the Walter Reed doctor say you were not taking hydroxychloroquine, but I previously heard you tell the public you were taking it everyday.  It led to people really believing that that was an effective drug and a lot of controversy.
1312533493956571137 2020-10-04 07:22:25 +0800 <againsthatred1> @realDonaldTrump Not one word of concern about the people you infected-just bragging about yourself and how much you are loved.

1312502959834505216 2020-10-04 05:21:05 +0800 <againsthatred1> @StephenKing @GovChristie @maddow He potentially spread it to many innocent people by not taking precautions-some of those could get very sick or die.

He attacked Biden‚Äôs sons and bragged about his super spreader rallies. Trump‚Äôs  toilet mouth was in full force at the debate with zero sympathy or kindness for others.
1312436170610012163 2020-10-04 00:55:41 +0800 <againsthatred1> @GovChristie Better stay off the beach.

1312412114527629317 2020-10-03 23:20:06 +0800 <againsthatred1> @newtgingrich He DID NOT condemn it.  He told them to ‚Äú stand down and stand by‚Äù at the debate.  Have you considered having the wax cleaned out of your ears?

1312151149303062528 2020-10-03 06:03:07 +0800 <againsthatred1> @lintan19 @donwinslow Well that is one way to get out of debates, change the hot topics, and rally his base.  I am usually extremely compassionate, but it is difficult to believe a liar. He is a coward.
1312122127839944704 2020-10-03 04:07:47 +0800 <againsthatred1> @wolfblitzer @CDCgov Unless we see proof that Trump‚Äôs COVID test was positive, I have no reason to believe that a devious, pathological liar is telling the truth.  The effects of this is controlling the media dialogue.  Anyone mention that he will not denounce white supremacists today?
1312098661459877888 2020-10-03 02:34:33 +0800 <againsthatred1> @Jim_Jordan You thought you said the virus was a Democrat hoax.  If you were exposed to Trump during the debate, why aren‚Äôt you quarantining?  Is it because Trump isn‚Äôt really sick????
1312098175474307072 2020-10-03 02:32:37 +0800 <againsthatred1> @Jim_Jordan Aren‚Äôt you going to have to quarantine and be tested and do contact tracing?  You were just exposed to him?ü§ì

1312042667229011969 2020-10-02 22:52:03 +0800 <againsthatred1> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity And are all those rally goers and the people with whom they came into contact going to have to quarantine???

Is this COVID diagnosis real, or just a cowardly way to get out of debates and change the media dialogue from the fact that he supports white supremacists? Looking forward to ZOOM debates!!!
1312040437226577927 2020-10-02 22:43:11 +0800 <againsthatred1> @seanhannity We are ALL begging for MERCY from Donald‚Äôs loud abusive interrupting. BTW may we see the COVID diagnosis, because this seems like a way of changing the media dialogue from his failure to denounce white supremacy. ZOOM is the perfect venue to mute him during the next two debates.
1312032202092433411 2020-10-02 22:10:28 +0800 <againsthatred1> @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Are you willing to release your tests results and whether you were taking hydroxychloroquine every day???  It seems like you just found a diabolical way to take the media focus off your failure to denounce white supremacists.
1312031618673119237 2020-10-02 22:08:08 +0800 <againsthatred1> @cnnbrk He certainly succeeded in turning media attention away from his failure to denounce white supremacy, hasn‚Äôt he.  I think I would want to see valid test results before I wasted days yammering about this.  He is controlling your dialogue.
1312030510726688769 2020-10-02 22:03:44 +0800 <againsthatred1> @donwinslow Predictable for sure.  This is the only way he can do to change the subject from his failure to denounce white supremacists.  He is that devious.

He knew about the dangers of the virus and the manner in which it spread at least by late January, and he didn‚Äôt notify the public, doctors, or hospitals in NYC that were seeing these cases and misdiagnosing them.

This horrific event reminds us of the importance of gun reform. Also, all of these shooting are sad, but when it happens in your hometown, it pulls the rug out from under you.
1312000340091338754 2020-10-02 20:03:51 +0800 <againsthatred1> @keithedwards I believe one of these true:  1.Trump purposely exposed the public, the media, and government figures to Covid recently and in the past; 3. He is attempting a politically charged deception;  3.  He will be watched over by the best doctors 24/7 unlike the people he exposed.

1311958484590759936 2020-10-02 17:17:32 +0800 <againsthatred1> @seanhannity Chris Cuomo broadcast live every night, and he was REALLY sick.  I thought Trump was taking hydroxychloroquine daily and that the virus was a Democrat hoax.  Which is it?  Confused.
1311957241097072640 2020-10-02 17:12:35 +0800 <againsthatred1> @seanhannity Great he can debate via ZOOM.

1311833031976591360 2020-10-02 08:59:02 +0800 <againsthatred1> @atrupar That is not true ‚ÄîTrump did not denounce white supremacists at the debate.  He told them to ‚Äústand by.‚Äù  How much does a professional liar get paid?

1311809183205990404 2020-10-02 07:24:16 +0800 <againsthatred1> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity It is an entertainment‚ÄîI mean propaganda station.
1311808509462417408 2020-10-02 07:21:35 +0800 <againsthatred1> @funder @realDonaldTrump He projects everything he does onto others.  This is why I believe that all of Trump‚Äôs fraudulent voting scenarios and accusations at the debate are actually things he is doing and/ or planning.
1311732287441195008 2020-10-02 02:18:42 +0800 <againsthatred1> @loribelle100 @CJ_Haslett @JillFilipovic Trump characterized Mexicans as ‚Äúrapists and thugs.‚Äù  THAT is offensive.

1311700248318877699 2020-10-02 00:11:24 +0800 <againsthatred1> @PressSec You just LIED on CNN and said Trump denounced white supremacy during the debate.  He said, ‚ÄúStand back and standby.‚Äù  He refused to denounce them, just as he refused after Charlottesville and after the Pittsburgh synagogue shootings that Trump‚Äôs hate speech on immigrants incited.
1311681704755695619 2020-10-01 22:57:42 +0800 <againsthatred1> @Parthenon1 @JRubinBlogger ByeDon clearly stated he has NO PLAN TO DEFUND POLICE just to bring people together to weed out the bad apples among many good cops.  What did you hear??  I know Trump was having a 90 minute loud abusive tantrum.

1311629170775130112 2020-10-01 19:28:57 +0800 <againsthatred1> @CJ_Haslett @JillFilipovic Women are judged harshly by misogynists and women who want to live in the 50‚Äôs but men like Trump are excused for lying and spreading hate speech every day. White supremacists and neo Nazis ARE a‚Äùbasket of deplorables‚Äù and so are those okay with Trump not denouncing those groups.

1311292482165108736 2020-09-30 21:11:05 +0800 <againsthatred1> @jonfavs Trump indicates that we could be facing a CIVIL WAR during and after the election. Is this another scare tactic-his rhetoric has motivated violence before.  His lies about a ‚Äúcaravan of invaders‚Äù motivated a crazed shooter to murder 11 Jews in Pittsburgh before the midterms.

1311282268590219266 2020-09-30 20:30:29 +0800 <againsthatred1> @seanhannity Also Trump is on tape stating to BOB Woodward that he knows young healthy adults get severe cases of COVID.  I heard him on the debate stage say only elderly with underlying conditions get it. Do you know how many people lost or almost lost their 20, 30, or young 40 family?????
1311281460737978368 2020-09-30 20:27:17 +0800 <againsthatred1> @seanhannity Trump displayed all of the ugliness we have seen inside him all that once and magnified last night: insulting, lying, mocking, deflecting, interrupting, bragging, and I think he beat the ring wing talking heads.

1310987567400202242 2020-09-30 00:59:27 +0800 <againsthatred1> @bennyjohnson Trump supporters will vote for him if he burns down their homes or shoots their family in plain sight.  It is a phenomenon that is baffling.  I am not sure why they are even watching the debates.

So why is it okay if they struggle, even tho the Supreme Court is not in session? You do not represent people.

Where is their ‚Äúurgency‚Äù to help people whose industries still haven‚Äôt opened up from COVID?  They haven‚Äôt had Care Act money since the end of July.

So what if another 100,000 die, as long as he wins?  Trump puts his cult at risk at his conventions and rallies.  He uses them as pawns who are expendable and boost his ego.

However you heard them and saw them-they deterred your motorcade from leaving the neighborhood.  No one met you at the airport and the only conscious patient at the hospital refused to see you.
