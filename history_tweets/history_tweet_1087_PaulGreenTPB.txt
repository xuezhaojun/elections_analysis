1333839352766607360 2020-12-02 02:24:17 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @annietrev could I ask you to raise the question of the importance of unpaid carers when the timetable of Corvid vaccine schedules is being considered. Without us the NHS would collapse and I feel it’s sensible to have us close to the front of the queue.

1330645499221827584 2020-11-23 06:53:03 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @r0bs0nj Was a result of door being slightly open but freezer refuses to freeze. Emptied, to bags of food dumped and left turned off hopefully it’s a sensor with brain freeze. Try again tomorrow and if no good will call them. Thanks

1330191822270959617 2020-11-22 00:50:18 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @r0bs0nj @realgreatbrit Yes but often the alternative is the population grows  outstripping resources and the animals are facing a slow death my starvation
1330181888825307139 2020-11-22 00:10:50 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @AmazonHelp Yes we have Prime Music, however on the new device it does not offer the option to play music via that, instead states we must sign up to Unlimited. Now I have more info I can bypass but very misleading and only people to benefit is Amazon but new subscriptions
1330181090489888768 2020-11-22 00:07:40 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @r0bs0nj @realgreatbrit To be honest I have no real idea, a professional kill I would say yes but just as easy for a fox to be wounded and escape to die. It’s certainly more efficient as more are killed, many times it escaped when hunting with dogs.
1330174428886523904 2020-11-21 23:41:11 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @AmazonHelp We don’t have and have never had Amazon Music Unlimited. However some of the playlist my wife has does include paid for tracks. To repeat, we could play those playlists and ask for specific tracks on our first Echo Dot and still can on that device. Please read the question
1330171837267980294 2020-11-21 23:30:54 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @r0bs0nj @realgreatbrit But they aren’t, not now . They are shot but hunting is trail hunting, following a laid track. I wouldn’t support old style hunting, modern way retains employment, community and tradition. I’ll informed people see red jackets and make a wrong assumption
1330170591928856583 2020-11-21 23:25:57 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Beware, buy a new generation Echo Dot and you have to pay extra to access specific songs , free on the older models. #alexa #music #Amazon #ripoff

1330168997552279570 2020-11-21 23:19:37 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @AmazonHelp I could ask my Echo Dot to play a specific music track and it would, still does as it’s now in my kitchen. New echo delivered yesterday insists I must sign up to Amazon Unlimited, why and can I change. If not it’s getting sent back

1320789313999802369 2020-10-27 02:08:06 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @Iromg @RationalPanic Open the school kitchens over holidays. Kids in need get fed, suppliers get business and kids get to see their mates. If there is a problem of some parents trying to swap vouchers for other goods that’s sorted. Not a U turn and Labour can’t complain, possibly 🙄

1320752315113132035 2020-10-26 23:41:04 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @MissDemeanor07 We use them for FTTH, we have no choice as no other suppliers have equipment in the exchange. It’s fast for a rural area 75/20 and reliable. Only problem we have is engineers fixing other faults often kink the cables in the exchange and were down. Luckily hasn’t happened lately
1320750982217740288 2020-10-26 23:35:47 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Why not open school kitchens for children that need help. Kids get fed as they do at term time, suppliers are getting trade and if as some say a few parents try to sell vouchers for other things it avoids that possibility. Plus kids get contact with their friends. #schoolmeals

Once the heat was put on they started to emerge. It took at least a dozen cans of fly spray squirted into the vents to kill them, but we still heard buzzing

1319623374583308288 2020-10-23 20:55:04 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @Geo_Toni85 Pretty much same here, father left when I was 2 and brought up my mother and grandmother. But I dislike getting lectures by rich people on how poor people need help without putting their hands in their own pockets. As to the vote that is Labour playing politics with kids
1319596572997521413 2020-10-23 19:08:34 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @bbcnewcastle @alfiejoey @coast_care @NorthWildlife @LisaShawRadio I spent ages yesterday trying to get a picture of the Osprey rotor tilt aircraft yesterday only to have it fly over the house very low in darkness but I get your point 😉

1319588130002030594 2020-10-23 18:35:01 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Snigger, thankfully they are 😉
1319587402302840832 2020-10-23 18:32:08 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Well said . Sadly the parents of the children most in need are the ones who will use dodgy shops to buy anything else but food with them. And yes, I have seen it , even way back with infant milk tokens it went on.
1319586635982450690 2020-10-23 18:29:05 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Does he really need glasses, never seen them under his helmet or is it a fashion statement. Little tip mate, think you’re failing 🙄

1319583625021693952 2020-10-23 18:17:07 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @alfiejoey @MarcusRashford No set up a local group and approach schools and get something going. There maybe problems sorting out data issues but sure it’s possible. My daughter volunteers at a homeless centre in Norfolk, food, advice, clothing etc . No fuss, locally sourced but being going ages
1319580844193910785 2020-10-23 18:06:04 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @alfiejoey @MarcusRashford Then why didn’t they do it anonymously, without the publicity of hanging on the coat tails of a “celebrity .” Most will have good intentions but if he and all his fellow players offered 1% of their salary, let’s ignore the tax avoidance schemes, they could likely solve a lot
1319579365366243328 2020-10-23 18:00:11 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Scrolling through my Tweets i see some people claiming that #COVID19 is a big conspiracy, for what end can vary wildly. However many of the same Tweeters and some others also lambast the government for its incompetence. Emm , which is it ? As far as I see it can’t be both.

1316339815936335872 2020-10-14 19:27:23 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @bbcnewcastle @alfiejoey So do something we did months ago for months and expect a different result?
1316338318922207234 2020-10-14 19:21:26 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @thetruebluechef Lots of exercises going on, I live near Otterburn range and seen lots of helos and other aircraft about as well as curio on the range
1316335568402350080 2020-10-14 19:10:30 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @corporal_frank Really odd as here in Northumberland we have had no problems. I called to book my flu jab, they called to do a review of my wife’s prescriptions and district nurse visits for bloods etc
1316335136028471297 2020-10-14 19:08:47 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Something I have mentioned before

1316056761997066240 2020-10-14 00:42:37 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @truemagic68 The idea we tried for months, months ago?  Did it work , asking for a friend 🙄

1316040049910308865 2020-10-13 23:36:13 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @talkRADIO Dan can you ask all the callers who say it’s a fake and the government, or someone is making up the numbers why? What is the purpose and to they truly believe a secret across government, civil service, hundreds could be kept.
1316037903953334272 2020-10-13 23:27:41 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> One of these came over earlier at a 1000 feet. I got rather excited 😁  https://t.co/ahSnPM8IG3

1315764447244419072 2020-10-13 05:21:04 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @thetruebluechef Ok, I admire people like you that have the ability, experience and knowledge to produce food that gives people enjoyment. It’s one of the treats my wife and I enjoy, occasionally being able to get out and eat great tasting food.
1315761253537775616 2020-10-13 05:08:23 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @Iromg Just wondering why that fact isn’t being considered when all the doom and gloom is predicted. A bit like the “protect the vulnerable “ mantra. As in lock the doors then send food and medicine parcels in then forget us. As a carer I hear that all the time. To many glib words
1315759209649180673 2020-10-13 05:00:15 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @Iromg But many pubs were struggling before the pandemic. How many would have gone down anyway?
1315758936134430720 2020-10-13 04:59:10 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @thetruebluechef Yes but I would 😁

1315747927042777090 2020-10-13 04:15:25 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @thetruebluechef Try going from £68k a year, 20 years ago to £47 a week, now £67. Try getting anyone interested or to pay anything extra in tax to fund social care. That experience influences my sympathy to present situation. Plus solution is to lock us in/ down and forget us.

1315298891949109249 2020-10-11 22:31:07 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> I guess there is some horsey thing going on in North Northumberland today and it appears none of those driving horse boxes have mirrors that work. At least judging by the queues behind them . Want courtesy when there on the horse on the roads, works both ways.

1314964662409101313 2020-10-11 00:23:01 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @talkRADIO You are the 3rd Talk Radio presenter I have asked what does “protect the vulnerable “ mean ? I am a carer for my wife, vulnerable so are we to be locked away, food and medicine parcels dropped off till when ? I can tell you there is no system that can anything else.

Turns out she had been told , wrongly I had been sitting with another women in a pub. Married now for 41 years 😏
1314325841803911168 2020-10-09 06:04:34 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @MerielMyers Probably oldest thing is the cottage, built around 1810 . Other than that it’s a plaster chicken storage jar from my wife’s mother, around 1960 ish
1314318598756872193 2020-10-09 05:35:47 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @thetruebluechef @SkyNews We did notice a different approach from the usual restaurant we use, part of a chain. They packed tables and put screens up, local independent now screens but distances table to table. Latter felt more “ normal “, no idea which is better for business
1314313931930955777 2020-10-09 05:17:14 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @thetruebluechef @SkyNews Was at local pub restaurant yesterday, independent and even for midweek it was quiet.

Protect the vulnerable, and their carers, what does that mean. Imprisonment till the end of time with food and medicine parcels? Is that compassionate

1313739952702795776 2020-10-07 15:16:27 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @talkRADIO as I have said many times the phrase “ protect the vulnerable “ means locking them in their homes, along with people like me carers. Sending food and medicine in at forgetting about them as there is NO system in place to do anything else. Very compassionate

1313529395936718848 2020-10-07 01:19:46 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @thetruebluechef Yes that why I said some. Several pubs round here in a rural but beautiful area have closed over 2 years ago and are still for sale.

Probably happy to go to a pub or restaurant but moan about this. Typical unions
1313524143556628480 2020-10-07 00:58:54 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @thetruebluechef But what many people are it seems ignoring is how many in that sector were already struggling. Constant news about how pubs and some restaurants were closing. Corvid I feel has hastened that
1313460185319563265 2020-10-06 20:44:45 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> And unpaid carers such as me

1312802168576061440 2020-10-05 01:10:02 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> For those people tweeting and posting that Mad Max was set in 2020. You’re wrong  Mad Max, which in 1979, opens with , “A few years from now.” That, and a piece of graffiti on a road sign in one scene dated December, 1984, puts the events of the first film squarely the mid 80s
1312792534092054530 2020-10-05 00:31:45 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Just had a heavy shower of rain so brief I heard it cross the roof and then watched it advance across the field. Really weird 🤔

1312682248127291392 2020-10-04 17:13:31 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @r0bs0nj Thought I would finish off the last of a bottle of whiskey. Only a couple of glasses but obviously bigger than I thought

1312392659928068098 2020-10-03 22:02:47 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> What is the point if having @Eurosport_UK as part of my @SkyUK package if they keep putting #bsb on Quest? Meaning my recording gives me bloody cycling. Rather pissed off 😡

1312041245427073024 2020-10-02 22:46:24 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Not very helpful when it came to the disabled diverse part of your customers during lockdown. Universally ignored tweets and calls for some help and clarification on allowing unpaid carers access to stores during hours for pain carers and NHS.
1312031732200284160 2020-10-02 22:08:35 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Yet you close of parts of Alnwick preventing people with walking difficulties accessing and a theatre/library with no disabled parking I have seen

1311987223403859968 2020-10-02 19:11:44 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @malongoman But there never will be 100% compliance, as there isn’t with any rule or law.
1311974848604893189 2020-10-02 18:22:33 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @malongoman That’s the same with anything. She was caught so must face the consequences

1311658734662283264 2020-10-01 21:26:26 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @talkRADIO Your guest representing cyclists is a classic example, ignore breaking a law and divert the debate to a tiny amount of drivers using emotive language. License, compulsory insurance and method of ID for cyclists, same as every wheeled road user. Then report them
1311609596126072832 2020-10-01 18:11:10 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Ok settle a debate, it’s between me and my wife so really an argument, is this picture of a lake or trees? The predominant feature I mean.  https://t.co/9Y5he7jwca

Government and Boris are just doing as good a job as I or you could do facing same problems

1311060590408994816 2020-09-30 05:49:37 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @Iromg As i said when it was live they and others should have listened when people like me said the DWP was not fit for purpose. But when this is done they and others will forget. Leaving the disabled and carers in the same place. My sympathy is waning
1311059609294123011 2020-09-30 05:45:43 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @KatieMagnet Love the series and devoured the books

1310920117807730693 2020-09-29 20:31:26 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Do companies employ the thickest individuals in the packaging department? Pick up a item, insert into packing see label “ tear here to open “ and decide that’s the perfect place to sellotape around 🙄
1310880504439345152 2020-09-29 17:54:01 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @Iromg Mike while I have sympathy for your recent caller but people like me who had to become a carer years ago faced the same problem, as are new carers and disabled people now. No one was interested then nor now till it hit them. Anyone listening now ?
1310682161276768256 2020-09-29 04:45:53 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @juliemac1000 Are you early or late 😁
1310626974021251072 2020-09-29 01:06:35 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Then why negotiate a rise of that amount in the first place?
1310625945510907910 2020-09-29 01:02:30 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> This is now Prime service from @amazon @AmazonHelp . Second item not delivered on time, this was due on the 27th.

1310477599949426688 2020-09-28 15:13:01 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @talkRADIO what I don’t want is MPs who love the sound of their own voices debating any lockdown measures. Which is what I fear will happen when a quick response is needed.
1310313899678367745 2020-09-28 04:22:32 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @grahamwettone @LadBonnie Yes I agree on both points I was just curious for an informed opinion and I have heard you on various media so hence the question
1310311220336041984 2020-09-28 04:11:53 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @grahamwettone @LadBonnie But the lack of a mask ? Why would that be ok ? Genuine question

1310186968958074882 2020-09-27 19:58:10 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @ONEUKBA Wouldn’t work, pub closes so they lose money and punters move onto next pub till they end up at the one in the area stays open the latest
1310173966947024897 2020-09-27 19:06:30 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Shocking
1310173813120946177 2020-09-27 19:05:53 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @ONEUKBA So when pubs shut at 11 or night clubs at 2 am there wasn’t sights like that ? Of course there was and any of my mates working the doors will tell you that.
1310172973807144960 2020-09-27 19:02:33 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @JuliaHB1 @ONEUKBA But would it be any different at 10.30, 11 or 11.30 ? I think not
1310163609893376000 2020-09-27 18:25:20 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @bbc5live this morning asking a student how they were coping with lockdown. It’s been two days FFS 🙄
1310156144648826880 2020-09-27 17:55:41 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @thetruebluechef Listening to BBC Radio 5 this morning hearing students telling of big parties going on in halls, banging on doors telling people to come out as they want to give them Corvid it appears many aren’t following rules
1310148369671688192 2020-09-27 17:24:47 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Can you pass these to the driver, post code NE66 4 route. Turn in to track to house and sign  https://t.co/aMhjkKvkkw
1310138109993025536 2020-09-27 16:44:01 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> I saw the driver leave local village and drive past the road to my house, the one with a sign on telling him the address. Spent closer to 10k with you over last 18 months, hundreds of delivery’s but now you can’t find me. Also took out your Platinum credit card, scrap that
1310125327595851776 2020-09-27 15:53:13 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Ok another day of waiting to see if @AmazonHelp can deliver parcel from yesterday plus one due today. Customer over 8 years, same address but they had to “ fix address issues.” 🙄 Really poor service
1310124642389102592 2020-09-27 15:50:30 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @bbc5live I downloaded the NHS App, no problem with battery life but not very localised info. Lumps me in deepest rural Northumberland as same risk as a town in other end of county. Would prefer more local risk information
1310117393629351936 2020-09-27 15:21:42 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @bbc5live The media and people in general talk of “protecting the vulnerable “ Two days in and everyone is talking about the least vulnerable and it’s plain they can’t get service’s. As I have often said NO ONE can explain in detail how elderly and the sick would be protected
1309952990284066817 2020-09-27 04:28:25 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> And if she wasn’t white there would be protesting and celebrities taking a knee

1309902901083504643 2020-09-27 01:09:23 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Wonderful 😁
1309902518122614784 2020-09-27 01:07:51 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> As my Tweet said I have contacted customer services and parcel will be delivered, hopefully 🙄tomorrow. We have spent tens of thousands with you over last year but of late benefits of Prime as fading, poor service
1309900923955752961 2020-09-27 01:01:31 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @MichaelJPoulter @bbcnewcastle @alfiejoey In vinyl though 😉
1309878829868085253 2020-09-26 23:33:44 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Putting the 🔥 on , a old school style with sticks and a bleazer. Which just gave an almighty CRACK as it warmed up. As I was sitting day dreaming I almost crapped myself.😏
1309868249786572800 2020-09-26 22:51:41 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @suziperry @sepangracing @ValeYellow46 Love him and love his style but I don’t want him to quit at a low point. Nothing to prove so bow out now, much as I would hate that .😏
1309867746314858496 2020-09-26 22:49:41 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Wait in all day for a #Amazon delivery, tracking driver leaving local village then “attempted delivery.” Rubbish, contact customer services and driver couldn’t find us, any landmarks 🙄 So a bloody sign post isn’t enough? Wait till tomorrow,have another parcel, gets silly
1309851654234279937 2020-09-26 21:45:44 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @SharonNicholl2 @FreezePeach49 You mean Arabic ?

1309847473251389444 2020-09-26 21:29:08 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Anyone hear Hamilton’s mention the murdered police officer? No, just usual BLM bullocks. #F1
1309816700884447232 2020-09-26 19:26:51 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> No contest

1309813385282957312 2020-09-26 19:13:40 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> What’s the point for searching for books in Amazon Unlimited only to be presented with a list of books not in Unlimited 🙄 #amazonuk
1309801371420549120 2020-09-26 18:25:56 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @mikebrewer watching old WD episodes on Quest. Noticed you had much more of a London Geezer accent back then 😉
1309800665586298881 2020-09-26 18:23:08 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @Iromg And wouldn’t it happen been the same whatever times the pubs closed? I have never gone for the idea having longer opening hours means less people piling out when pubs close .
1309549449321099264 2020-09-26 01:44:53 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Agree

1309433615852490752 2020-09-25 18:04:36 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Starting to get sick of YouTube. Understand the need for advertising but watch a 15 minute or so program and there is four adverts. OTT.

1309419768382775296 2020-09-25 17:09:35 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Too bad, so sad. The 4 unfollowers I just tracked on  https://t.co/fgSaj71Cyl won't know how awesome I am. #whounfollowedme
1309419088582762496 2020-09-25 17:06:53 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> And unpaid #carers who without the NHS would collapse. Just a reminder as carers events are coming up

1309154164371587072 2020-09-24 23:34:10 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> My sons GF kid has a persistent cough, sent home from school, 3 other siblings also had to be sent home, couldn’t use public transport so cost over £40. Once home kid admitted he had drunk bubble blowing mix for a dare, hence the cough. Still needs to have a test. 😏
1309149523483201541 2020-09-24 23:15:43 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Reminder to Alexa to “ put duck in oven.” Reminder she gave “ put dog in oven.”🙄
1309117576136585221 2020-09-24 21:08:47 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @talkRADIO I downloaded the NHS app but it occurred to me as I leave my phone in the car now, to lessen any risk of infection it’s not going to be much use 😏
1309114225911095299 2020-09-24 20:55:28 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @talkRADIO Ian people like me ,a carer and my wife on DLA and now PIP have tried to draw attention to the complex and inefficient benefits system. No one wanted to listen, sadly now the public are getting a taste of what we have had to deal with for years. Should have listened
1309105749365272579 2020-09-24 20:21:47 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @thetruebluechef We just buy bigger bottles from Amazon and top up smaller bottles we bought. In early days my wife made some natural sanitizer but it turned my hands red raw.
1309105290349031424 2020-09-24 20:19:57 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @talkRADIO Ian , try getting a chimney sweep. There flat out partly due to the first lockdown creating a back log
1309080728639016961 2020-09-24 18:42:21 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Absolutely
1309078426784014337 2020-09-24 18:33:13 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> I shall be listening
1309062408674123785 2020-09-24 17:29:34 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @Iromg Mike I downloaded the NHS Track App. Seems a bit of a blunt tool as it only takes first part of post code. So I am lumped in with towns and cities in NE England even though I am in a very rural area
1309053159118172160 2020-09-24 16:52:48 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> NHS contact tracing app launches in England and Wales . I downloaded it, anyone else? What do you think of it .  https://t.co/HezUtOBxvN

1308873113636147200 2020-09-24 04:57:22 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Do you think sex workers are offering deals , £10 to see their chin 😉
1308867378361651202 2020-09-24 04:34:35 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @stevenrinella enjoying latest episodes of Meat Eater here in the UK but also found Stars in the Sky. Interesting thoughts on hunting
1308843732691714050 2020-09-24 03:00:37 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @clarewilliams14 @Iromg Such as ?
1308843511064735745 2020-09-24 02:59:44 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @FrankiLoveMusic Pretty wide. Rock,metal , classical and some arias
1308843241312321541 2020-09-24 02:58:40 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> 😂😂😂😂 Dicks
1308842660107612161 2020-09-24 02:56:21 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Heart breaking and you hear all over the media the glib phrase “ protect the vulnerable.” They have no idea 🤬
1308842224533344257 2020-09-24 02:54:38 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @juliemac1000 Ditto with the fire grate in the Summer 😁

1308755912086163461 2020-09-23 21:11:39 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Boring 🙄

1308717820465815553 2020-09-23 18:40:17 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @Alberta59124343 Take every opportunity as you never know what’s in the future. As a carer who once enjoyed a good salary and life till my wife became ill it’s the one thing I always say
1308717242243309573 2020-09-23 18:37:59 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @HopkinsBRFC Moronic behaviour 😏
1308716764000325632 2020-09-23 18:36:05 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @GeoffNorcott @thetruebluechef 70 % + I think the You Gov poll said
1308716537323413505 2020-09-23 18:35:11 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @Alberta59124343 As in held back on your train journey, a simple joke 😉
1308714416385470464 2020-09-23 18:26:46 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @Alberta59124343 If the train is cancelled you will be 😉
1308714172323164160 2020-09-23 18:25:48 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @Melissa00504928 @thetruebluechef If so then you need to inform the authorities of an unexpected death. Have a doctor confirm cause of death and issue a certificate. No expert but you might struggle to do that.😉
1308708598852317184 2020-09-23 18:03:39 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @thetruebluechef Because she is a medical professional and her job is to treat you as a patient and not to offer advice on a global pandemic, outside her knowledge base, that would have been unprofessional.
1308675135726145537 2020-09-23 15:50:41 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> There are around 8.8million unpaid carers saving the country £132 BILLION every year. All I hear and read of is industrial groups and individuals saying they must have help, usually money due to #Covid19UK restrictions. But as usual carers, the sick and disabled are ignored.😏
1308464418276216832 2020-09-23 01:53:22 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @Iromg Did wonder listening live are all MPs to take the course?  Or can only white people be racist? As I have brown faced friends who can have racist opinions of black people I know that’s false.
1308456779987255297 2020-09-23 01:23:00 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Glad I know 😉  https://t.co/pk8oc4xLxl
1308454156324220929 2020-09-23 01:12:35 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> So across many media sites they say people are angry about the new restrictions.  https://t.co/423BnOtesg
1308452828118167552 2020-09-23 01:07:18 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @juliemac1000 Well it was over 40 years ago so no 😉
1308441193689296897 2020-09-23 00:21:04 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @talkRADIO Dan I have tweeted and spoken to Ian yesterday on his show about the oft used phrase”protect the vulnerable.” As a carer I can tell you there was not any system in place before #Coronavirus , there isn’t one now . To trot it out is meaningless
1308432758876844033 2020-09-22 23:47:33 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Just lit a fire for the first time in months. Glancing at the articles in the newspapers as I lay them in the grate the complaints, armchair expert theories and general whining about #coronavirus has not changed from the start till now. Rather suspect same people to 🙄
1308430879950241792 2020-09-22 23:40:05 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> Absolutely
1308404881796063232 2020-09-22 21:56:47 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @HubDorset I am trying to get a higher focus from media and government for the lack of resources available to both carers and those they car for when they are parroting out “protect the vulnerable.” So far with little success
1308359700094824456 2020-09-22 18:57:15 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> And delivery slots filling up. Protect the vulnerable or I’m all right jack ?
1308359101412511744 2020-09-22 18:54:52 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @malongoman They did improve, just seems a coincidence. Makes sense for us to use as round trip plus the shop easily takes up half a day
1308356759975792640 2020-09-22 18:45:34 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @malongoman Seen reports on here from friends in North Shields and Blyth. Plus just had our usual delivery and lots of items missing
1308352408041467910 2020-09-22 18:28:16 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> A challenge to any #media outlet that parrots the phrase “ protect the vulnerable.” As a #carer I know there is no system,local or national that can do that fully. So explain how this would happen, if you can, happy to guest on any debate. @talkRADIO @LBC @bbc5live #Covid19UK
1308299937063424001 2020-09-22 14:59:46 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @talkRADIO All I heard from Lisa from Labour was vague ideas and aims. Nothing solid
1308298356830003200 2020-09-22 14:53:29 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @talkRADIO I wish people would stop saying “ shield the vulnerable “ without telling me how that works. There is no system in place to do that and I cannot find anyone that can tell me how one would miraculously spring up. By shield people mean lock them in their homes .
1308145421156528131 2020-09-22 04:45:47 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @Iromg @talkRADIO And well deserved across the shows
1308116786102054913 2020-09-22 02:52:00 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @HeatherAthey Seen lots at neighbours over weekend and even on Facebook pictures of families, not in same household, meeting
1308108476955189248 2020-09-22 02:18:59 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> “Protect the vulnerable.” That’s what I hear on here and all over the media. In reality panic buying has begun and delivery slots are filling up. In short “fuck the vulnerable, I’m all right jack.” We are a nation of many people ,some who are liars 😏 #Covid_19 #coronavirus
1308061457217654787 2020-09-21 23:12:08 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> In social claiming they can’t get tested 😏
1308060969495658496 2020-09-21 23:10:12 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @juliemac1000 Oddly no 😁but I do wonder why I bother having a shave
1307990780317962240 2020-09-21 18:31:17 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @truemagic68 I am a carer for one of the vulnerable and quite simply there is no system in place to support us. That was proven during the last lock down , we struggled to get delivery of food and medicines. As a result we had to spend more using costlier options for food.
1307940600440918016 2020-09-21 15:11:54 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @talkRADIO @JuliaHB1 @benjaminbutter My neighbour, we only have 3 as rural area, has had family from outside the home visit,including children. Daughters boyfriend visited, other friends as well. She is a nurse at local hospital so if she is ignoring guidelines what hope everyone else ?
1307772675494993921 2020-09-21 04:04:37 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> 😔

1307577592317444096 2020-09-20 15:09:26 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @bbc5live Unpaid carers have  been ignored during the corvid 19 crisis. Struggled to get food delivered,equally so with medicines. As a result we had to use more expensive options for food, many are caring for people still shielding , no focus on us including or mental health
1307373875160907777 2020-09-20 01:39:56 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @back_samuel @mssassysally If the cop had started dancing singing “chin,chinery, chin” version of the sweep song in Mary Poppins, that would be funny 😆 t
1307370577070522370 2020-09-20 01:26:50 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> So everyone buy fireworks and set them off at midnight and flood Twitter with pictures and videos. Of course it would be a very childish act to get a hash tag poking fun at a certain someone trending 😉 Wouldn’t it ?

1307278436097024006 2020-09-19 19:20:41 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @MrFrancis_ Simply pointing out the human face behind the words. We didn’t have a well resourced, funded or decent support system before the pandemic. The odds of that changing quickly to react to changes in response to corvid 19 is nil. So easy to use the phrase, harder to give confidence
1307275556887683074 2020-09-19 19:09:15 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @MrFrancis_ As I said all the suggestions you made simply did not happen during last lockdown, even basics such as food and medicine were extremely hard to have delivered. Plus to blithely ignore the mental health issues ,its what I always seems a carer. Behind closed doors so ignore
1307272277738876929 2020-09-19 18:56:13 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @MrFrancis_ All good but never happened despite government assurances last time and you didn’t answer maybe the most important question. They would still be in prison, I know two people who have to shield and have seen the effects on their mental health.
1307265662553935872 2020-09-19 18:29:56 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @MrFrancis_ I hear that all the time “protect the vulnerable.” What does it mean, eternal lockdown in their homes ? Same people who suggest that usually mention mental health problems of lockdown. I never hear and solution or suggestions

But no plans other than imprisonment in their home as to how to protect them. At the same time bemoaning the problems any further lockdown brings . Double standards?

1306632386734706693 2020-09-18 00:33:31 +0800 <PaulGreenTPB> @talkRADIO I keep hearing people saying “protect the vulnerable .” What that means is blithely committing to putting people in a prison of their own home and forgetting about them. I know two people this applies to and the deteriorating mental health is awful to see.
