1325974243281088513 2020-11-10 09:31:09 +0800 <MorrisJ65> Tucker's mention of the milk bottles at the fair reminded me of my favorite line when I ran the Dime Pitch at Coney Island!

I was negative reacting(?)...meaning there's not enough info to indicate I've had it and am immune?

Waiting for prime time!?!
1325956575027212291 2020-11-10 08:20:57 +0800 <MorrisJ65> Watching Martha McCallum's opening monolog and assessment seems pretty reasonable to me...and she's holding Eric Swalwell's feet to the fire in a manner that says she's "jake" with me!-)  Fox may be a mixed bag but I'd be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater???

Solves my problem as, at times, I get listed with a (large) group of people I really like but some extended conversations tend to so fill my "notifications" that it's hard to manage your other exchanges!
1318524502092009472 2020-10-20 20:08:32 +0800 <MorrisJ65> Irony is that, since the Republicans ended slavery back in the 19th Century, it's Biden with his "Crime Bill" that put so many Blacks back "in chains"!  It took President Trump, with his "Second Chance Act" to break those chains!-)
