You are raised by paid agents of the state on a diet of social concerns and moral displays, by elementary school teachers who gratify not individual rights, nor entrepreneurship or creativity, but "good behavior," i.e. compliance and non-disruptiveness.

1343896790882463744 2020-12-29 20:28:57 +0800 <JFGariepy> Someone predicted this. I don't remember who though.
1343776011008282626 2020-12-29 12:29:01 +0800 <JFGariepy> @JohnKubie But the fact that fire safety measures pre-existed COVID shutdowns only goes to show that some amount of communism pre-existed the current amount of communism.
1343775340402003969 2020-12-29 12:26:21 +0800 <JFGariepy> @JohnKubie Since the only thing that determines the ownership of a Bitcoin is whether someone has access to controlling its sending.
1343775240279760896 2020-12-29 12:25:58 +0800 <JFGariepy> @JohnKubie Sure, it is the proportion of control that determines ownership. Control and ownership are ultimately the same thing; if you do not own something fully you don't control it fully and if you don't control something fully you don't own it fully. Bitcoiners understand this.
1343767484692897792 2020-12-29 11:55:09 +0800 <JFGariepy> @JohnKubie Is it a form of control of the means of production though?
1343762724736675840 2020-12-29 11:36:14 +0800 <JFGariepy> @DadbodTurtle I am a moral nihilist. I am a moral nihilist because it is a true statement that the directional space of morals is undefined other than through an axiom that sets it.
1343761844738121728 2020-12-29 11:32:44 +0800 <JFGariepy> @4moreye14135025 Your statement is false.
1343760319081046016 2020-12-29 11:26:40 +0800 <JFGariepy> Or perhaps you have an inappropriately-limited view of what "controlling the means of production" means. For instance, would you say that COVID shutdowns constitute a control of the means of production? I would.

Wouldn't be surprised that about 10-20 Republicans do it for Trump and for their voters, even if technically it is not a Republican type of policy in principle.
1343688093816205312 2020-12-29 06:39:40 +0800 <JFGariepy> The 2000$ checks are currently being voted on. Seems like it will clearly pass the house. It would take almost all senate republicans to oppose to it in the senate for it not to pass. So I expect it to pass. No sign of section 230 reform yet.
1343398496314019840 2020-12-28 11:28:55 +0800 <JFGariepy> Please understand what happened tonight: @realDonaldTrump, who spent the last four years telling us that Washington is a swamp, decided to abandon any leverage on it and now tells us he trusts the politicians will handle his section 230 requests without any leverage.

1342891524720308235 2020-12-27 01:54:23 +0800 <JFGariepy> I've long addressed this question. Governments do this because they are not subject to an ever-improving function, such as those found in biological evolution and capitalism.  Rather, they are subject to an ever-worsening function. Thus they converge toward corruption (broadly).

1338268034725711873 2020-12-14 07:42:17 +0800 <JFGariepy> @jack_rearden @ramzpaul It could be that way for certain countries. But even in a country that has backdating of deaths to the actual day of death, you could still see the effect simply because people are less likely to die on weekends in general.
1338265226211418118 2020-12-14 07:31:08 +0800 <JFGariepy> There may even be, in extreme cases, a will to engage into a fight that one knows they will lose. Just to demonstrate what the opponent is willing to do to win.
1338264993599528965 2020-12-14 07:30:12 +0800 <JFGariepy> Sometimes, @TriversRobert, men who have a surplus of wealth find it in their interest to pursue a cause they find noble, even if they don't mathematically benefit from it. I can think of a few evolutionary systems leading to this kind of nobility-displaying behavior.

1338229649055289345 2020-12-14 05:09:46 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Julius77543874 So you've seen 2020 and you think self-destruction of America is far-fetched?
1338227462174597120 2020-12-14 05:01:04 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Julius77543874 In the long run, USD will fluctuate more in value than Bitcoin. USD is infinitely printable.
1338225480152064002 2020-12-14 04:53:12 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Julius77543874 Sure, I'm up for considering this hypothesis once your toenail clippings generate capital flows in the billions of dollars per day. Until then, I'll trust Bitcoin.
1338225102689808384 2020-12-14 04:51:42 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Julius77543874 You're correct, and Bitcoin offers less valuation fluctuations than the USD.
1338223079173066754 2020-12-14 04:43:39 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Julius77543874 You can transfer a billion dollar from anywhere to anywhere in the world within 45 minutes for a fee of 5$.  As for the storage of wealth, it has a finite cap of 21 million. No printing, no mining, no asteroids.
1338221379003559936 2020-12-14 04:36:54 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Julius77543874 1. The value of bitcoin is not solely based on its ability to circumvent financial regulations.  2. There is no such thing as intrinsic value. Only market value exists in the world.

I don't know that Trump will follow-up on his threat, but it's great to see him defund the military if there is no change to it.

1334192485342584832 2020-12-03 01:47:31 +0800 <JFGariepy> @thenamelesswar Who knows. A super-HIV virus spreading around, causing victims auto-immune disorders and death, at worse.
1334181173820592128 2020-12-03 01:02:34 +0800 <JFGariepy> @ConsentJohnny Oh man, so much work...
1334170011192143875 2020-12-03 00:18:13 +0800 <JFGariepy> This use of "it's" is exactly what's wrong with the modern world.
1334168392929058824 2020-12-03 00:11:47 +0800 <JFGariepy> @SimplyBiochem @thenamelesswar Thanks for acknowledging the possibility. Here's a list of other things for which probability is virtually zero: that wings would suddenly grow out of a reptile's body allowing it to fly, or that wolves would accept being carried around by humans with a leash.
1334160883086397440 2020-12-02 23:41:56 +0800 <JFGariepy> @SimplyBiochem @thenamelesswar Highly unlikely, but what's highly unlikely may become likely if you do it 7 billion times.
1334160764370907136 2020-12-02 23:41:28 +0800 <JFGariepy> @SimplyBiochem @thenamelesswar Sure for the trials, but then once the vaccine is released to billions it will have to encounter people with HIV, even if accidentally or unknowingly.
1334160611333304323 2020-12-02 23:40:51 +0800 <JFGariepy> @SimplyBiochem @thenamelesswar That's what is expected but obviously this system does not always work, since there are autoimmune disorders. My worry is that a part of the population will be affected by uncontrolled autoimmune responses.
1334140112192548864 2020-12-02 22:19:24 +0800 <JFGariepy> @thenamelesswar @SimplyBiochem That's a second worry that I've expressed separately: what if some critical cells of yours show the spike on their membrane and as a result becomes target of autoimmunity? Plus, what if a retrovirus adds the vaccine mRNA to its own genome and spreads spikes across all your cells?
1334131998412181507 2020-12-02 21:47:10 +0800 <JFGariepy> @thenamelesswar Well, human cells do have reverse transcriptase when they are infected with a retrovirus, like HIV.

1327742442028806145 2020-11-15 06:37:21 +0800 <JFGariepy> Hi @EricRWeinstein, I would love to speak with you about the concept of phenotypic revolutions, test you a little bit on Dawkins and the theory of evolution, and we could also talk about whether the DISC relates to certain forms of ethnocentrism. Just DMed you, let's do this!
1327735409082851329 2020-11-15 06:09:24 +0800 <JFGariepy> I will have to push tonight's show to 8:30 PM ET. Reason: sushis.

1325857750094647307 2020-11-10 01:48:15 +0800 <JFGariepy> Let me help leftists understand what's going on here. Trump identifies as a legitimately elected President, you are disrespecting his desired pronoun uses, and in doing so you deny his lived experience.
1325846289989459974 2020-11-10 01:02:43 +0800 <JFGariepy> Great video by Coach on those who make lists. Reminds me of the Kraut days.  https://t.co/xob13J2tP8
1325644787014373378 2020-11-09 11:42:01 +0800 <JFGariepy> Now tell me @sapinker, do you believe that a President has the responsibility to accept a result even if he genuinely believes fraud has been committed that was important enough to affect the result?
1325632951976140800 2020-11-09 10:54:59 +0800 <JFGariepy> As I've often said, the Cambrian explosion could be an artifact of poor fossil sampling. We are bound to find more and more details from finer fossils with time!

1325499131834589184 2020-11-09 02:03:14 +0800 <JFGariepy> @severian22 Yeah, it's too much poetry not enough thinking as usual.
1325488403484340224 2020-11-09 01:20:36 +0800 <JFGariepy> @ConsentJohnny I deleted 21. There was no 25 yet because I was too sick. Will do it tonight!
1325477015789645828 2020-11-09 00:35:21 +0800 <JFGariepy> Ouch, @ConceptualJames' enlightened centrism btfoed.
1325417477749305346 2020-11-08 20:38:46 +0800 <JFGariepy> Will we have a Black Republican candidate in 2024 to channel that energy?
1325401192177033216 2020-11-08 19:34:03 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Panchodelaja I said on its own, worn by an untrained member of the public who otherwise touches contamined stuff with their hands that indeed, the protection would be minimal.
1325400221556346880 2020-11-08 19:30:12 +0800 <JFGariepy> As I said many months ago, the COVID masks were going to become the political flag of Democrats, like the footballers' eye black, worn as a sign of readiness to go to war. Take note, future right-wingers. Don't fall for the authoritarianism next time.
1325278499989577731 2020-11-08 11:26:31 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Greg65405658 Had to cancel, voice has not improved since yesterday.
1325268104650354690 2020-11-08 10:45:13 +0800 <JFGariepy> In contrast, when the left is ruled by us, they have to wake up every morning with the inner conviction that they live under some fantasized fascistic dictatorship.
1325268103417229312 2020-11-08 10:45:12 +0800 <JFGariepy> On my side, I get to see leftists served by their completely inefficient government that will only pay lip service to their values while directing their money to their own people, while exacerbating any problem they proposed to resolve.
1325268100082765827 2020-11-08 10:45:12 +0800 <JFGariepy> We're only one day into this victory announcement by the media and I realize something: my life ruled by my political opponents is so much funnier than their life under our rule.
1325207275707969536 2020-11-08 06:43:30 +0800 <JFGariepy> @PascalHenrard Non, les √©lections aux √âtats-Unis sont prises en charge par les √©tats, pas le gouvernement f√©d√©ral.
1325189959758741504 2020-11-08 05:34:41 +0800 <JFGariepy> @hadid221 Haha, I saw enough of them falling in line behind Biden to conclude that they liked it better that way... may not be all of them, but there are plenty.
1325186593947328512 2020-11-08 05:21:19 +0800 <JFGariepy> Leftists: Your dreams, crushed.
1325170415103324160 2020-11-08 04:17:02 +0800 <JFGariepy> @NedPamphilon You'll have to scroll on my twitter profile, retweeted the graphs within the last 72 hours.
1325169817578573824 2020-11-08 04:14:39 +0800 <JFGariepy> You'll have to wait for January.
1325167684963561484 2020-11-08 04:06:11 +0800 <JFGariepy> @NedPamphilon To be clear, whether there was fraud or not is an independent question from the support among groups. Trump has gained support among all groups but lost white males, this is true ind. of fraud potential.
1325167017461129218 2020-11-08 04:03:32 +0800 <JFGariepy> @JPMGGA You are wrong.
1325164695729426434 2020-11-08 03:54:18 +0800 <JFGariepy> This. Trump traded votes that were necessary to victory with votes that were useless. Never abandon the base that gave you victory, been saying it for 3 years now.
1325162229616967681 2020-11-08 03:44:30 +0800 <JFGariepy> Haha, with the hoodie, nice! üòÄ

1325109956127977475 2020-11-08 00:16:47 +0800 <JFGariepy> From Steven Franssen, a look at the geographical distribution of Google Search trends for the terms "election fraud punishment." Interesting.  https://t.co/xM3bJCBSSJ

1324816279685992449 2020-11-07 04:49:49 +0800 <JFGariepy> @jd30174351 Yes, there could be various subtleties in the US Supreme Court's interpretation but that could be a valid one.
1324806690705911810 2020-11-07 04:11:43 +0800 <JFGariepy> Beautiful article that explains in very simple words how the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision concerning mail-in ballot will most likely end up being judged unconstitutional, and many, if not all, mail-in ballots could be void in this state.  https://t.co/oBZDA214Hc
1324801994691907595 2020-11-07 03:53:03 +0800 <JFGariepy> Obviously, the problem with recounts is that you will be recounting the fraudulent votes too.
1324780817911058435 2020-11-07 02:28:54 +0800 <JFGariepy> @cashmoneyglock Oh it will. Just not with so much passion and moral grandeur.
1324772391537528833 2020-11-07 01:55:25 +0800 <JFGariepy> Do it @realDonaldTrump! Scorched earth!
1324769977979817984 2020-11-07 01:45:50 +0800 <JFGariepy> @salmon_spooky You're right. They'll stabilize.
1324765787501010946 2020-11-07 01:29:11 +0800 <JFGariepy> Dear leftists, unless there is intervention by the courts, you will get a Biden presidency and it won't improve anything in your life. Looking forward to it.

1324707682914324482 2020-11-06 21:38:18 +0800 <JFGariepy> @eugene_pnf Not a problem at all. They created the necessary narratives that can be deployed on any future virus.
1324706773362683904 2020-11-06 21:34:41 +0800 <JFGariepy> @eugene_pnf Oh there'll be plenty of other occasions.
1324704800961974272 2020-11-06 21:26:51 +0800 <JFGariepy> @eugene_pnf Hum I think they'll keep the moral panic up for a month or two for appearances. That gives us Nov-Dec so it doesn't even get us to inauguration.
1324698874720718851 2020-11-06 21:03:18 +0800 <JFGariepy> @ConsentJohnny Oh yes they want it.

1324643378185818115 2020-11-06 17:22:46 +0800 <JFGariepy> @RichardBSpencer Depends, @RichardBSpencer. You could have a FCC regulation that strongly limits what a "good faith" removal is. Then, you could have 1st amendment challenges in courts based on the fact that the discretion left to social media companies then becomes anti-constitutional.
1324584040574439424 2020-11-06 13:26:59 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Mike09572367 Yeah. Most of these stories do not form the basis of my last show precisely because I perceived the same flaws as he identifies. There are still other remaining stories that deserve attention.
1324539490841624578 2020-11-06 10:29:58 +0800 <JFGariepy> We must now turn our legal attention toward Georgia.
1324526908273528832 2020-11-06 09:39:58 +0800 <JFGariepy> @CassandraRules or words such as "by a margin of...," or just use raw counts rather than percentage.
1324526329539284992 2020-11-06 09:37:40 +0800 <JFGariepy> @CassandraRules No you're good. You're using percentages in the additive sphere, which will confuse some people but your numbers are okay. Using words like "trailing by a 5.1% edge..." or something like that can help clear the confusion.
1324494413385637889 2020-11-06 07:30:50 +0800 <JFGariepy> Going live in 30 minutes. We'll talk about the situation including the Trump Press Conference.  https://t.co/CKFz9lkXen

1324342876092928001 2020-11-05 21:28:41 +0800 <JFGariepy> .. we would expect a similar advance for Biden, which would flip the current totals which come out as +172554 for Trump, to +117897 for Biden. That's if the Dem advantage from 2016 is reproduced and they do succeed at counting the votes legally.
1324342875275075584 2020-11-05 21:28:41 +0800 <JFGariepy> In 2016, the Wayne county, a big one, went overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton providing her with an edge of 290,451 votes. That is why the media is predicting a flip for Michigan; once those votes come into the count, unless Trump has greatly improved his performance from 2016...
1324342874461380610 2020-11-05 21:28:41 +0800 <JFGariepy> Looking at county-by-county data, there are 81/83 reported as fully counted by Michigan SOS. The two remaining counties are Antrim and Wayne for as far as I can understand their Excel sheet.
1324342873211416576 2020-11-05 21:28:40 +0800 <JFGariepy> Some people are confused between the narratives from the mainstream media which has called Michigan for Biden, and the  https://t.co/LI2m5O9GQH, which still shows an official count with an advance for Trump.  https://t.co/Z0EBhdnPW4
1324151163365838848 2020-11-05 08:46:53 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Wolfpup872 No as announced earlier I lost my voice.
1324146725582442499 2020-11-05 08:29:15 +0800 <JFGariepy> This is important. We already have indications from the Supreme Court that they will stick to the letter of the law of each state rather than executive diktats.
1324143345493516290 2020-11-05 08:15:49 +0800 <JFGariepy> I'd love to see what's being considered for blockchain solutions to the voting problem. Some questions are: how do we make the process transparent and auditable while keeping the privacy of the content of the vote?
1324111174124883969 2020-11-05 06:07:59 +0800 <JFGariepy> I must cancel tonight's show because I have lost my voice. Like yesterday, I'm very hopeful about a potential Trump win through Pennsylvania and Arizona. There will certainly be litigation but it may not be necessary at all.

1323561659714162688 2020-11-03 17:44:24 +0800 <JFGariepy> The path there remains long, however. One must then realize that humans are involved in a competitive evolutionary struggle and that our moral systems are subject to exploitative interference.

1322982582498320386 2020-11-02 03:23:22 +0800 <JFGariepy> @eugene_pnf You go ahead and give me a timestamp. I covered COVID before most people covered it and it was sober, scientific and still accurate as of today coverage.
1322981865196867586 2020-11-02 03:20:31 +0800 <JFGariepy> @eugene_pnf Me? I didn't. Stood against invasions of individual rights since January when they were doing it in China.
1322958669735206913 2020-11-02 01:48:20 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Burdman_at_law @KeithWoodsYT Thanks for agreeing with me that he needs to see a doctor.
1322896266263748608 2020-11-01 21:40:22 +0800 <JFGariepy> @BreLaurenn Yes.
1322895906040123399 2020-11-01 21:38:56 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Burdman_at_law @KeithWoodsYT Explain how it is wrong. Are you aware that nausea is a major cause of concern because it might reveal in this case a progression of the disease to the brainstem?
1322895485888274433 2020-11-01 21:37:16 +0800 <JFGariepy> @BreLaurenn I think we have a poor understanding of how much failed deactivation there really is so you might just be right!
1322892359357575169 2020-11-01 21:24:51 +0800 <JFGariepy> @BreLaurenn The other gentleman misunderstood your question. The answer is generally, or in principle, no. If the deactivation process of the flu shot has worked, you are not the carrier of a transmissible version of the virus. See exceptions however, such as failed deactivation (polio).
1322878271466459136 2020-11-01 20:28:52 +0800 <JFGariepy> @KeithWoodsYT Not good, looks like it might be conjunctivitis combined with graver inflammation potentially around the optic nerve or wherever it is that you feel pain. Should go to doctor to figure out if it can be fought. Worse case scenario may include blindness or death.

1322311078815141890 2020-10-31 06:55:03 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Julius77543874 Why would a bird that has wings be more likely to produce babies that have wings and that obtain all nutrients necessary from the environment so that they can build wings? Because they've been naturally selected to be that way.
1322308663340638208 2020-10-31 06:45:27 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Julius77543874 ...and undermine whoever is holding "the limit" in place. It's an evolutionary slippery slope. Just like the path that leads to birds having wings.
1322308496499552256 2020-10-31 06:44:47 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Julius77543874 ...more babies. There are now more people in your population with an interest at pushing genetic mods. They ask you to now allow combating alzheimer's, then IQ levels, then dystrophia, then... You've always let enough of them gain an advantage big enough to outcompete...
1322308212289380354 2020-10-31 06:43:39 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Julius77543874 Meaning whatever limit you impose, you are also allowing parts of it to develop. The part that develops (however small it is) eventually subsumes your limits. Ex: you first allow just fixing parkinson's disease. More and more people live longer lives because of this and have...
1322306187820453889 2020-10-31 06:35:37 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Julius77543874 Nop, I've told you enough, at this point I'll tell you to read the book and come back to me if you have questions!
1322303081317568512 2020-10-31 06:23:16 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Julius77543874 Your control mechanism is selected away because it is always located at the border of the progression of the revolutionary phenotype. People evolve to want to remove your control mechanism because it helps them reproduce more.
1322299323414175749 2020-10-31 06:08:20 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Julius77543874 Nop, you'll have to buy it. Everything's in the book. Native replicators lose because the revolutionary phenotype is a better encoder of genes and because it can print genes of the native life form, therefore outcompeting them ecologically and informationally.
1322291978143518727 2020-10-31 05:39:09 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Julius77543874 This is also a correct description.
1322290673832366081 2020-10-31 05:33:58 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Julius77543874 It is an event during which a life form that used to be formed of individuals carrying genes gets transformed into sterile workers of a central entity, therefore losing their status as gene carriers and delegating their evolution to the queen.

1321514210522779650 2020-10-29 02:08:34 +0800 <JFGariepy> @NoGuiltStoic It's an argument that's been around for a long time. As far as I can tell it is correct, in that if you use 1000 SNPs you get close to a 100% correspondence between genes and self-identified race.

1319696427833085952 2020-10-24 01:45:21 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Averagewhite14 Of course if you have extra money after all your self-sustainability is figured out I don't oppose to savings :P
1319693951029383169 2020-10-24 01:35:31 +0800 <JFGariepy> This is why I don't recommend savings in terms of storing stagnant money in the bank. A much better way to save is to build a garden, learn self-sustainability, reduce the cost of your life and find a place where you could survive even if you made 0$. Prepping is the best saving.  https://t.co/QF7tkctis7
1319686545612431360 2020-10-24 01:06:05 +0800 <JFGariepy> Good to see @EricRWeinstein come around.
1319685389628526592 2020-10-24 01:01:30 +0800 <JFGariepy> @USApatriot12 All the power McDonald's has is to produce delicious burgers for me and I'm fine with it. Had I retweeted an agent of the state, you wouldn't have minded, yet that person has more illegitimate power than McDonald's.
1319683604805550083 2020-10-24 00:54:24 +0800 <JFGariepy> So is it coming back?
1319677343078748162 2020-10-24 00:29:31 +0800 <JFGariepy> Can we get a fact check? Of course we can't.
1319495838767435776 2020-10-23 12:28:17 +0800 <JFGariepy> @RichardBSpencer To be clear, I do think Trump is submissive to Israeli interests also. But I think he would hold guilt in his heart if he was to engage in an actual invasion because of his promise to the people. So I'd expect only air strikes from him.
1319494954482282497 2020-10-23 12:24:46 +0800 <JFGariepy> @RichardBSpencer I think a random middle eastern intervention is very likely, yes. Which country specifically? You'd have to ask Bibi.
1319494711766286338 2020-10-23 12:23:48 +0800 <JFGariepy> Chad @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell doesn't hesitate to get into fist fights to maintain dominance over his senate and ensure the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett.  https://t.co/Z01lhQWPh8

1319360191104692224 2020-10-23 03:29:16 +0800 <JFGariepy> Long before @BretWeinstein was banned from Facebook others were. I was there when it happened to Alex Jones and stood by him. I was there when it happened to all my nationalist friends and stood by them. Where was @BretWeinstein?
1319348551927947265 2020-10-23 02:43:01 +0800 <JFGariepy> @RRR0BYN Reason I'm asking is that JBP in his early days was: combating pro-LGBT compelled speech, valuing religious mythology and combating a form of marxism.  The new JBP is siding with censors (Faith Goldy case), siding with mobs (Brett Kavanaugh comments) and psychologically unstable.
1319330896827371528 2020-10-23 01:32:52 +0800 <JFGariepy> Daily reminder that these people are the very same who are telling you they can't talk about the New York Post story because it's unverified (although it's been verified by business partners of Hunter).  https://t.co/ioFqcwXftw
1319323878141939714 2020-10-23 01:04:59 +0800 <JFGariepy> 2020 will be retained as the year where "verification" of information by journalists came back into fashion, after years of "reportedly, anonymous sources claim that..."
1319299106842550282 2020-10-22 23:26:33 +0800 <JFGariepy> Tonight's show will be moved to 8:30 PM ET so we can simultaneously watch the presidential debate.

1319001231231275009 2020-10-22 03:42:54 +0800 <JFGariepy> Hahahaha.
1318963461263659013 2020-10-22 01:12:48 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Joshua4NPV1 So you want the government to be smaller but you'll put the fault on them when they don't invasively control people's nutrition, health and exposure to natural risks. You live in contradiction.
1318961038142935040 2020-10-22 01:03:11 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Joshua4NPV1 You've been feminized by modern society into wanting a manly figure to save yourself from the forces of nature, when all this time you should have been taught you had to become that figure.
1318959796154961920 2020-10-22 00:58:15 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Joshua4NPV1 See how we moved from counting hundreds of thousands of deaths as being Trump's fault to "maybe, I don't know, a little bit." Impressive it all happened in 3 tweet exchanges.
1318958184585973765 2020-10-22 00:51:50 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Joshua4NPV1 So you think it's a president's responsibility to manage the health and nutrition decisions of the population?
1318957114484719620 2020-10-22 00:47:35 +0800 <JFGariepy> Why do you think more people died in America? (Assuming your calculations are correct). Comorbidities, which have developed under Obama. Are you going to hold Obama responsible for this?
1318956019607867393 2020-10-22 00:43:14 +0800 <JFGariepy> Talk about burying the lead. The Guardian article mentions the fictitious line "she's 15" before it mentions the name of the actress, which allows one to easily find that she's 23-24. Proper title: Rudy is a normal man whose penis will still respond to a flirting adult female.
1318886691478900743 2020-10-21 20:07:45 +0800 <JFGariepy> Hunter Biden: Organizes an Ukrainian extortion scheme with father while supervising a Chinese pay-for-play, while smoking crack and keeping underage pictures on his Facetime.  Media: Did you know that Trump may have opened a bank account in China?  Leftism is a helluva drug.
1318875604876464131 2020-10-21 19:23:42 +0800 <JFGariepy> I predicted this. 2020-2021 will be the great separation between BTC and most alts.

1316810848879423488 2020-10-16 02:39:06 +0800 <JFGariepy> @Danger_Smoog @MouthyBuddha There's a difference between saying: "I'm deleting this video because I have no choice but I still stand by it." and "You know, I spoke to Kraut, he was sad, so I deleted the video."
1316778749757661187 2020-10-16 00:31:33 +0800 <JFGariepy> @PotsPol @MouthyBuddha Yes. He did it as a follow-up to a full interview with Kraut and Tea in which there was no scientific argument provided, only social reasons and emotional arguments.
1316776030099644419 2020-10-16 00:20:44 +0800 <JFGariepy> For those asking "what do you mean JF?" Well I just mean that @MouthyBuddha had taken the time years ago to disavow his own work with me and walk back for non-scientific reasons on scientific realities. Just goes to show it doesn't help to kneel to the powerful and be a coward.

But you can tweet a link to a separate newspaper like Breitbart which links to the New York Post article.  Let's face it, our authoritarian tech oligarchs are not even competent at what they do.

1309482845300125701 2020-09-25 21:20:13 +0800 <JFGariepy> @jardiniernormie Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Why do you think they are something else than matter/physical processes?

1309479458831622144 2020-09-25 21:06:46 +0800 <JFGariepy> @jardiniernormie Here's your evidence: babies are matter. Babies create new consciousnesses.
1309476642645966848 2020-09-25 20:55:35 +0800 <JFGariepy> @KeithWoodsYT "If I damage the engine, the car stops working. That doesn't mean the car is the engine." -&gt; No one said the car was the engine.
1309475287395004417 2020-09-25 20:50:12 +0800 <JFGariepy> @jardiniernormie It is. Every single time consciousness emerges is because some baby is born, just like every single time a car emerges is because some industry put together steel parts.
1309474538967592961 2020-09-25 20:47:13 +0800 <JFGariepy> @KeithWoodsYT You affirm this but do not even begin to explain why that would be, as you refuse to answer my other interrogations about what are the physical laws that keep arrangements to produce consciousness.
1309473321415708672 2020-09-25 20:42:23 +0800 <JFGariepy> @jardiniernormie You are an infinite source of useless considerations, bye.
1309472507984900096 2020-09-25 20:39:09 +0800 <JFGariepy> @jardiniernormie We do know a great deal though. For instance, the reason you can see if the neural networks from your eyes to V1 and other areas of your brain. Then the reason you can act is the motor cortex and spinal cord.
1309472333917089792 2020-09-25 20:38:27 +0800 <JFGariepy> @jardiniernormie I haven't claimed that we knew how neural networks were doing that so this line of questioning is useless.

1309470994201944065 2020-09-25 20:33:08 +0800 <JFGariepy> @someguy676 @KeithWoodsYT I didn't say anything about a pink elephant I talked about the virtual image of a pink elephant. You are bringing something completely different.
1309470792648810502 2020-09-25 20:32:20 +0800 <JFGariepy> @jardiniernormie The building blocks of consciousness are atoms or biological cells or neural networks depending on which level you want to look at it.
1309470412254793729 2020-09-25 20:30:49 +0800 <JFGariepy> @jardiniernormie @KeithWoodsYT Well, here's one part of consciousness: the parietal cortex. Here's another: the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
1309470301135101952 2020-09-25 20:30:23 +0800 <JFGariepy> @jardiniernormie You are wrong. I haven't claimed I understood all of the physical mechanisms of consciousness.
1309470109212184576 2020-09-25 20:29:37 +0800 <JFGariepy> @KeithWoodsYT Yes it can. The pink elephant's virtual image is located within the boundaries of your cranium, and there are even some surgeries that could be performed to keep you from being able to think about this pink elephant.
1309469044832002048 2020-09-25 20:25:23 +0800 <JFGariepy> @KeithWoodsYT Consciousness doesn't have carness. Doesn't change the argument.
1309461739239505923 2020-09-25 19:56:21 +0800 <JFGariepy> Unbelievable. They arrest the driver instead of the antifa milita pickup truck.
1309318046616494082 2020-09-25 10:25:22 +0800 <JFGariepy> @CountWaiblingen 1. Consciousness is obviously an emergent property because it needs a brain of some kind, which has many components.  2. Yes we can fix consciousness and diagnose its disorders, just like we would to a car.
1309314850305110017 2020-09-25 10:12:40 +0800 <JFGariepy> In general, @KeithWoodsYT oscillates between two goalposts: the one in his title, where he claims he will demonstrate the absurdity of the view, and a strawman where he just wants to make the case that the idea that every other view is wrong is ridiculous. He succeeds at neither.
1309314849193639937 2020-09-25 10:12:40 +0800 <JFGariepy> Again this is fallacious, because he has not demonstrated that the building blocks of our particular universe cannot be arranged properly into a truth-seeking machine, and indeed, there is no reason within materialism they couldn't.
1309314848086396929 2020-09-25 10:12:40 +0800 <JFGariepy> Finally, @KeithWoodsYT in his 3rd argument claims that seeing our own minds as being made up of physical building blocks logically leads to denying that the products of such minds (such as mathematical truths) are true.
1309314846941261824 2020-09-25 10:12:40 +0800 <JFGariepy> a complete new "substance" had emerged.  @KeithWoodsYT claims without rationale that such new category demands some God. Of course it doesn't - because it is fallacious to assume that a new category of things cannot have been made of smaller things that pre-existed it.
1309314845808836613 2020-09-25 10:12:39 +0800 <JFGariepy> that the emergence of this new category must imply the existence of a God. A new category in the universe does not require a God. Take for instance the first car that was ever made. Before that, no atoms had ever been arranged into a car. Suddenly, to paraphrase @KeithWoodsYT, ..
1309314844693127168 2020-09-25 10:12:39 +0800 <JFGariepy> The fact that something complex cannot be separated into parts that keep the properties of the bigger ensemble is not a challenge at all to materialism.   Next, @KeithWoodsYT seems to focus on "the moment consciousness emerged from matter," claiming...
1309314843581669377 2020-09-25 10:12:39 +0800 <JFGariepy> Arguments 1 and 2 can easily be destroyed by simply replacing "consciousness" with "cars." Deprive a car of some of its atoms (say, the engine), and it's not a functional car anymore. Same thing goes for consciousness.
1309314842394730496 2020-09-25 10:12:38 +0800 <JFGariepy> challenge to a materialistic worldview.  @KeithWoodsYT claims:  1. Consciousness is irreducible to particles and therefore creates a problem for materialism.  2. You'd need a God to explain the emergence of consciousness from matter.  3. Materialism leads to denial of truth.
1309314841140539393 2020-09-25 10:12:38 +0800 <JFGariepy> In order to understand how @KeithWoodsYT is wrong in his latest video, "Why Materialism Is Absurd," one simply has to replace the word "consciousness" with "cars." See, cars are an emergent property just like consciousness. They don't cause any sort of...  https://t.co/SBQ43IiLkC
