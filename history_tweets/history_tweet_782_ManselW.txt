1339285908349210625 2020-12-17 03:06:57 +0800 <ManselW> Last week I didn't get tested for pneumonia because I had no symptoms.  The week before I didn't get tested for flu. Guess why? Because I didn't have any symptoms. Why then, would I feel a need to get tested for covid 19 when, again, I have no symptoms.
1339285232755859458 2020-12-17 03:04:16 +0800 <ManselW> @sandieshoes I get what you're saying but it is no-ones fault if you were unaware you had the virus, and let's face it. Nearly everyone won't know if they have it or not. So no blame in an otherwise blame led culture.

A deal would be good but not any deal at any cost. The deal has to be beneficial to the UK or a 'no deal ' will be the best option.

Not half a year ago you were grovelling in front of, or running away from protesters. Where was your strength and authority then?

We are all perfectly capable of living our lives without you telling us who we can and can't mix with. Please just stop.

1331996389748912138 2020-11-27 00:21:01 +0800 <ManselW> @MattHancock Not any more. I was following the guidelines but not after today's diabolical infringement of my human rights. Please feel free to shove your tier system. If these measures worked then they would not be needed after 2 lock downs and 1 previous tier restriction. You are a fraud.
1331988821211287552 2020-11-26 23:50:56 +0800 <ManselW> @MattHancock You are destroying my business and my livelihood. You are damaging mine, and my family's mental health. Stop now. So far you have cost me in excess of ¬£50k in lost revenue. I am sorely tempted to bill you personally for this.

1326960377742172161 2020-11-13 02:49:42 +0800 <ManselW> @BrexitHome UK should have triggered no deal weeks ago. They were never going to offer a good deal so let's get on with it.

I must have missed a bit because he seemed to be calm and measured and the statements seemed to  address the issues correctly. He may have used the wrong 'currently in ' words but he wasn't offensive and didn't intend to be.

1325430443668361218 2020-11-08 21:30:17 +0800 <ManselW> @OTVDesk @BorisJohnson @MattHancock I was going to explain that their hands were tied and as such they had to be seen  to congratulate Biden in the interests of smoothing political waters between our 2 countries but I think it would be wasted. You have already written them off .  Try a less blinkered approach.

There are many other reports of votes being cancelled too. Try reporting all sides of a story.

1316464063493410816 2020-10-15 03:41:06 +0800 <ManselW> @BrexitHome Yes, its gone on long enough.
1316440932967882752 2020-10-15 02:09:11 +0800 <ManselW> @Wera_Hobhouse You are a menace to normal decent society you utter fool.
1316439260447342597 2020-10-15 02:02:32 +0800 <ManselW> @toryboypierce Thats the Green Party totally screwed. They will loose what little fantasy they had with this utter nonsense.
1316006446832771073 2020-10-13 21:22:41 +0800 <ManselW> @MaureenDalby Absolutely. You chose to buy the contents of your home, you never chose to invite them into it. If they break in to your home you should be allowed to protect your possessions with any necessary force.

1315688878595100680 2020-10-13 00:20:47 +0800 <ManselW> @BILDERBERG_GP Yes he should. It would be very rude ( and dare I say typical) of the EU to miss this deadline.

1314625956288647168 2020-10-10 01:57:07 +0800 <ManselW> @GortTheAvenger Racism. They should be sued. The more people are sued for this blatant racism the sooner it will stop.

1313839210953166852 2020-10-07 21:50:52 +0800 <ManselW> @MoggMentum Perhaps because he is.
1313838590305148928 2020-10-07 21:48:24 +0800 <ManselW> @geraldjmcgrath Thank you for deciding who and what I am. Anyone trying to remain in the failing EU is, in my opinion, the furthest thing away from a patriot. Anyone who would willingly hand over their country to another is not just unpatriotic but bordering on traitorous.

1313795926629253120 2020-10-07 18:58:52 +0800 <ManselW> @acgrayling I think we are all well aware of the disaster here and it isn't Brexit. It people like you desperate to undermine  the will of the people and destroy the country.
1313795454199627777 2020-10-07 18:57:00 +0800 <ManselW> @BrexitHome Walk away now. As a country we cannot be dictated to by the EU.

1310872652622557190 2020-09-29 17:22:49 +0800 <ManselW> @LadBonnie They could have stayed where they were. We didn't force them to come here.

1306310678114959363 2020-09-17 03:15:10 +0800 <ManselW> @FoxResurrected As far as I could see it wasn't a dance about topical issues , it was a dance promoting the unpleasant death of an unpleasant criminal and shouldn't have been shown at that time of the day. It was deliberately making a political statement that doesn't need to be made.
1306296222702080000 2020-09-17 02:17:43 +0800 <ManselW> @FoxResurrected @KarinBGraham @MirrorCeleb When he replied to criticism of the dance by calling everyone that disagreed with it racist.  That's when.
1306294504840998914 2020-09-17 02:10:54 +0800 <ManselW> @Melissa5857 It just shows her lack of intelligence.

1306284487005925376 2020-09-17 01:31:05 +0800 <ManselW> @BenedictSpence @HHelenakhl She just said 'whiteness is a capitalist structure.' I always thought it was genetic. So by her own admission are mixed race people only a bit capitalist and a bit marxist.
1306166040662028288 2020-09-16 17:40:26 +0800 <ManselW> @LeanneWood @Plaid_Cymru They should be detained until they have been checked, vetted, and proved to not be a danger to our country. Once their asylum claim has been agreed or declined they should be released or deported. A totally fair system for illegal migrants.
