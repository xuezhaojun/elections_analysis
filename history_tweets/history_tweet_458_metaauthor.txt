1342519704863305732 2020-12-26 01:16:55 +0800 <metaauthor> I am struggling to think of a myth cycle that operates on a similar model - the nearest is probably Beowulf, who takes on three threats with escalating stakes, ultimately dying to score the victory.
1342519192793309185 2020-12-26 01:14:53 +0800 <metaauthor> Now - putting on my Francis Wertham spectacles and frowning - what might be the effects on a society of such sequential storytelling, where we know good must triumph but can never win, and where every Pyrrhic victory sets up the next catastrophe?
1342518488859029506 2020-12-26 01:12:05 +0800 <metaauthor> Because the setting has no planned end, no planned climax, no victory can be lasting and must always set the seeds of some even more existential threat just down the road.
1342517629534220288 2020-12-26 01:08:40 +0800 <metaauthor> So let's review - as a result of the demands of the sequential storytelling medium, we are left with a reality that is constantly menaced by a vast and unknowable hierarchy of evil, and which only continues to exist through dumb luck.
1342516833707044865 2020-12-26 01:05:30 +0800 <metaauthor> As such, victory is usually accomplished through trickery - the bad guy is fooled into doing something that destabilises his own power source and he collapses into a black hole while screaming - sigh - 'Nooooo'. Reality is thus always a  fool's gambit from annihilation.
1342516556643893250 2020-12-26 01:04:24 +0800 <metaauthor> Nor is this a universe like Dragon Ball, where the heroes can undergo a Rocky training montage to become more powerful or suddenly reveal a new hair colour during the battle which tips the balance. Superman can no longer pull new powers out of his behind to win the day.
1342516071396474880 2020-12-26 01:02:28 +0800 <metaauthor> The good members of the hierarchy - such as the Spectre - exist to 'job' to new villains and show how powerful they are by giving them someone established to shockingly beat to a pulp.
1342515805045612545 2020-12-26 01:01:25 +0800 <metaauthor> The effect - whether intended by the writers or not - is that the 'cosmic hierarchy' - the supernatural backdrop of this continuity, multiverse, etc. is almost exclusively composed of evil entities.
1342515502170714114 2020-12-26 01:00:13 +0800 <metaauthor> So while it is now de rigeur for unimaginably powerful evil entities to come out of the woodwork, it is terribly gauche and poor storytelling for a similarly powerful hero to emerge during the event itself to restore the status quo (which we might term, 'good')
1342515283811041285 2020-12-26 00:59:21 +0800 <metaauthor> The event starts when the villain decides to embark on this course of action (a previously good or neutral character becomes evil) or obtains the power to carry it out (a powerful evil character arises).
1342515087815405569 2020-12-26 00:58:34 +0800 <metaauthor> With a massive ongoing continuity, each new crossover 'event' requires the stakes to be permanently jacked up. If not stopped the villain will destroy - the Earth! The galaxy! The universe! The multiverse!
1342514910627037185 2020-12-26 00:57:52 +0800 <metaauthor> I mused recently (but perhaps not on here) that the DCverse in particular has evolved, by the necessities of narrative, into something very unpleasant and Lovecraftian, with characters in the recent Crisis events even acknowledging this.
1342496153825386498 2020-12-25 23:43:20 +0800 <metaauthor> Has there ever been a gag where a character is informed that yes, the entire multiverse was threatened this week by a villain they've never heard of, but don't worry, Kh'battuu of Shkattar from the galaxy we call GN-z11 defeated him in an epic crossover event, so that's sorted?
1342495633073184769 2020-12-25 23:41:15 +0800 <metaauthor> DC explains the Earth-centric nature of its crises by explicitly suggesting that while alien civilisations exist, Earth is widely recognised as the lynchpin of the multiverse. I'm not sure if Marvel has ever explained why all the cosmic threats seem to end up near Earth.

1342162079038525443 2020-12-25 01:35:50 +0800 <metaauthor> Of course, the idea of supernatural weapons is hardly new to European folklore; Celtic examples include Gáe Bulg, Cúchulainn's legendary spear which, when thrown under very specific conditions, guaranteed a hit and kill, and the Lúin of Celtchair which can kill without hitting
1342160677813813248 2020-12-25 01:30:16 +0800 <metaauthor> By confining power to a specific supernatural item (which fit well into the well-known and accepted framework of the *relic*), charges of sorcery or alliance with negative supernatural creatures could be rebuffed.
1342160299244331008 2020-12-25 01:28:46 +0800 <metaauthor> Much could be made, incidentally, of the tendency in particularly post-Christianisation Europe to locate 'powers' in external artefacts such as swords, boots, armour, rather than internally as in other cultures and pre-Christian European myth
1342159868782850049 2020-12-25 01:27:03 +0800 <metaauthor> A similar concept may exist in European folklore via the repeated motif of 'seven-league boots' which permit one to move large distances with each step, seemingly without changing size or shape.
1342159462312902657 2020-12-25 01:25:26 +0800 <metaauthor> Most however take a rather different tack on the trope than modern sci-fi - rather than the teleporter ceasing to exist in one location and moving to another, most relate to the distance between locations somehow shrinking ('shukuchi: 'shrink earth', tay al-ard: 'fold the earth')
1342159071617671168 2020-12-25 01:23:53 +0800 <metaauthor> What's even more interesting is that *teleportation* appears to be a far more intuitive concept than time travel, with the Buddhist shukuchi, Arabic tay al-ard, Hebrew kefitzat haderach, Chinese qinggong, and Korean chukjibeop all relating to supernatural teleportation

A streamer is not creating or distributing a copy of the game but creating a transformative work (a video of someone playing a game). If that work is then copied and distributed without credit, that would be analogous to pirating the game.

1317183807464898561 2020-10-17 03:21:06 +0800 <metaauthor> After this it becomes less clear; it appears the developers intended Raziel to realise the Elder God 's evil and return to the Chronoplast to travel into the past as the end of the game. As far as I know no dialogue was recorded for this and no additional chronoplast areas exist.
1317183526714953731 2020-10-17 03:19:59 +0800 <metaauthor> With this ability he would have been able to return to the Silenced Cathedral and, possibly from the organ room, access the pinnacle, reactivating the cathedral to slay all vampires in Nosgoth. The dialogue for this was recorded and is in the final game files.

1310196702427648000 2020-09-27 20:36:50 +0800 <metaauthor> This last tendency seems to be common in religious reform, and can be explained insofar as with the advent of Zoroastrianism, 'worship of the daevas' was prohibited. Ahura Mazda appears to be a novel god as the ancient Iranians had a version of Deus called Patat Dywos.
1310195276339187715 2020-09-27 20:31:10 +0800 <metaauthor> The Germanic word 'God', meanwhile, probably derives from the PIE word for a libation and not the being the libation is being offered to (gheu - to pour). In Persia, 'deva' emerged as a reference to demons (just as in India 'aesir' survived as 'asura')
1310194649080963072 2020-09-27 20:28:41 +0800 <metaauthor> (We should also note that the IE name Deus was ultimately transferred to a non-Indo-European - as far as we know - God throughout Western Europe, who even today is known as 'Deus', 'Dieu' and 'Jove' (from Iuppiter and not, as popularly imagined, Yehowah).
1310189280472465413 2020-09-27 20:07:21 +0800 <metaauthor> Deus Pater ('Father Sky') was replaced as the chief god by Odin/Wotan for the Norse and Germanic peoples, and with Indra (and later Rudra and the Trimurti) for the Vedic peoples, but survived as Iupiter, Zeus, and, surprisingly, the Irish Dagda ('Dagdae' from 'Dago-Dēwos').
1310187058556809216 2020-09-27 19:58:31 +0800 <metaauthor> (It is possible that Os was invoked to mean 'the gods' and that Os is cognate to 'Aes' in 'Aesir')
1310186463166959617 2020-09-27 19:56:09 +0800 <metaauthor> (A side point on this; we have noted before that the Norse figure cognate to the Indo-European Deus Pater/Dyaus Pitr is not Odin but Tyr. However, the Anglo-Saxons at some point appear to have recognised a deity called Os, which survives as part of Oswald, Osric, and Osmund)
1310185243803082755 2020-09-27 19:51:18 +0800 <metaauthor> This doesn't sync up very well with Ancient Aliens types' needs however, as it's usually the new gods they are most interested in seeing as aliens (since, as we have discussed, some pre-Christian gods were actually newcomers themselves, this severely limits the timeline).
1310184734882922497 2020-09-27 19:49:17 +0800 <metaauthor> You would have to get metaphorical and argue the various 'old gods' (e.g. the Titanes), rather than being the gods or representations of a defeated people, are actual extraterrestrials, and the 'new gods' are mythological figures intended to provide comfort post-abandonment.
1310184187593453570 2020-09-27 19:47:07 +0800 <metaauthor> That being the case, why is not the single most universal mythological theme 'abandonment by the gods'? If religions encoded distorted stories of this era, this would surely be a major trope.
1310182632953704448 2020-09-27 19:40:56 +0800 <metaauthor> Regarding the below, I suppose they would argue that humans developing carts and chariots was a critical tech threshold for first contact, explaining why mythological gods don't appear to have had 'vehicles' before the invention of the wheel.

His puppet, Julian Nepos, is also omitted, but the similarly unrecognised Romulus Augustulus is... because it lines up better with the Israelite kings.
1307234399583457282 2020-09-19 16:25:42 +0800 <metaauthor> Unrecognised non-Emperor  Ricimer, a powerful Magister Militum who backed a string of Emperors, has been added and given an extra five years for no reason. His Emperors are not included, nor is his successor Gundobad.

1307233760115556352 2020-09-19 16:23:10 +0800 <metaauthor> Basically, what Fomenko has done here is go through and choose the Augustus (junior or senior), Caesar, usurper or foreign ocupier who closest matches the Israelite king he thinks he should match against. He sometimes lists the full reign of those who overlap and sometimes not.
1307233182887051265 2020-09-19 16:20:52 +0800 <metaauthor> Fomenko transcribes the biblical side more or less accurately (only, bizarrely, fudging Hoshea into a one year reign and inserting a period of 'anarchy', which we may assume corrresponds to vassalage under Tiglath-Pileser). The Roman side however...

If Maitreya will appear when knowledge of Dharma on Earth is almost extinct, could not more people be saved faster by working to spread a false teaching that replaces the true Dharma?
