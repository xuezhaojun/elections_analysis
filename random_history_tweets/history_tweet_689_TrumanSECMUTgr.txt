Our 2020 Election, from poorly rated Dominion to a Country FLOODED with unaccounted for Mail-In ballots, was probably our least secure EVER.

1333138481644703747 2020-11-30 03:59:17 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> A fake election with a fake president and a loss of our republic. It's apparent that our Constitution doesn't matter any longer. The Dem's will attempt to rewrite the articles in the Constitution that they don't agree and all hell is going to break out! God Save Us All! ...
1333137985190195203 2020-11-30 03:57:18 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> We have evidence that is over whelming regarding fraud in the election and it keeps getting thrown out by judges.

1329640743690973186 2020-11-20 12:20:31 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> The trump legal team gave a good 90 minute presentation re: the election and the issues all should be concerned.

1328750600641785856 2020-11-18 01:23:24 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> It is evident from the Senate Judicial hearing today that section 230 must be removed from Twitter, Facebook, and Google immediately! These platforms are arms of the liberal party trying to make America a socialist country. Eliminate section 230 protection immediately!
1328733909698404355 2020-11-18 00:17:05 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> How can this not have a warning label and block as hate speech. Section 230 must be removed from Twitter, Facebook, and Google.

1328733330704117766 2020-11-18 00:14:47 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Feinstein is basically saying that the warning is not strong enough by Twitter. I assume that by listening to Feinstein that the first amendment in her mind does not exist and all Tweets of POTUS should of been hidden!

1326702308089090049 2020-11-12 09:44:13 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Tucker tonight exposed the dead voters voting in all the states that are being challenged. He also went full Tucker on the AG of Michigan she is a real piece of work!

1326654844883656707 2020-11-12 06:35:37 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Amazon has slapped Vet's in the face this year by not giving them a discount on Amazon Prime. A $40 discount to a service that brings in money for 12 months is not very smart. Jeff Bezo's must of lost so much in his divorce that the Vet's are having to pay for it!üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
1326361082504634369 2020-11-11 11:08:19 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @jonvoight Are you going to go to Parler Jon?
1326262425004421120 2020-11-11 04:36:17 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @miles_commodore Seems to be happening to all of us! Could it be that they went to Parler and deleted their Twitter? I realize some may of but I'm on both and waiting to see how things work out!
1325998662649081857 2020-11-10 11:08:11 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @aloverofblue I never thought I misspelled it in the past!

1325621166183227392 2020-11-09 10:08:09 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @hrkbenowen Asshole!
1325612719429578752 2020-11-09 09:34:35 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @ChicagoGirl_68 I have done the same and waiting for a comment back.
1325612479947345922 2020-11-09 09:33:38 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @ChicagoGirl_68 I'm in Missouri open carry and go to the range to keep my aim current if ever needed, hopefully will never have to use it but no one should test me.
1325609928858476545 2020-11-09 09:23:30 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @ChicagoGirl_68 until it is investigated and solved. We have been warned to stock up on items that you do not want to run out of, especially if you live in the north.  Be sure to fill up your gas tanks. Be aware, prepare, and PRAY.   We need this nation still to be ONE NATION UNDER GOD again.
1325609718879039489 2020-11-09 09:22:40 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @ChicagoGirl_68 Citizens are aware hundreds of thousands of votes have been destroyed or hidden all over the nation.  People were threatened at the polls, and other illegal unconstitutional acts caused this election to not be legitimate and truckers are protesting, boycotting, and striking
1325609125083041795 2020-11-09 09:20:18 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @ChicagoGirl_68 A warning has gone out here in FL by Truckers for Trump.  Because of the fraudulent activity that has stolen votes de-legitimizing the election, truckers have warned us they are getting ready to call a NATIONWIDE STRIKE across the US  until a recount of EVERY vote has been made.
1325608896086601728 2020-11-09 09:19:24 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @ChicagoGirl_68 This I why I ask I received this message;  I JUST RECEIVED THIS MESSAGE FROM THE TRUCKER'S FOR TRUMP WHO ARE GETTING READY TO GO ON STRIKE ACROSS THE NATION UNTIL A RECOUNT OF EVERY VOTE IS COUNTED IN EVERY STATE... THIS IS WORTH READING!!! Hello everyone.
1325606660522586116 2020-11-09 09:10:31 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @ChicagoGirl_68 I asked because I heard they were going to go on strike, but I can't verify!
1325599232557002754 2020-11-09 08:41:00 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Anyone heard anything about Truckers for Trump?
1325584998028767233 2020-11-09 07:44:26 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @inittowinit007 @HLAurora63 Where did you get that from, Parler was not sold!
1325554694610096132 2020-11-09 05:44:01 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @marklevinshow He is a liberal hack who is as President Trump has said many times it not Mike Wallace. I can't stand this man, Fox News has changed so badly that they except for a chosen few are part of the MSM!
1325505670452490240 2020-11-09 02:29:13 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @Lrihendry You are correct it is not a glitch it was planted in the software!
1325505043592867840 2020-11-09 02:26:43 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> I doubt they will ive him any trouble since he has the highest viewership!

1325302200961265664 2020-11-08 13:00:42 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> One last Tweet for the evening. When President Trump wins all the legal battles, and is officially recognized as being re-elected Fox News will officially be grouped with the MSN enemy of the People! Newsmax is going to be the fastest growing network with many new personalities!
1325296639599325184 2020-11-08 12:38:36 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @Likeshesays @bakoff333 Twitter disputes the Tweet, they are full of BS!
1325296407524364288 2020-11-08 12:37:41 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> I keep losing followers by the hour, I'm already on Parler and could careless if Twitter continues to take my followers. Hell I can't even get thrown off Twitter for telling the truth, can't wait till they lose section 230 and the layoffs begin!
1325295707239145473 2020-11-08 12:34:54 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @newtgingrich @FoxNews I hope you don't leave anything out as Fox News has folded on him and the fraud is the reason for this sham election!
1325295235983962113 2020-11-08 12:33:01 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> So we have a new way to win the Presidency sit in the basement until the software glitch changes your challengers votes to you!
1325294454639632385 2020-11-08 12:29:55 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Fox News has thrown Trump over the ledge I predict that their ratings go down the toilet the way they turned on our President. Only Tucker, Hannity and Laura were worth watching and you can get them on video. Screw Fox!

1325125391728533504 2020-11-08 01:18:07 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Joe Biden no sane person has placed any faith in you!
1325124989327077376 2020-11-08 01:16:31 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> If this election is allowed to stand then we have given up our country to socialism/communism! As a Veteran I am appalled that my country has let us all down! If the SCOTUS doesn't chime in and stop this travesty the USA is dead!
1325123021250703361 2020-11-08 01:08:42 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> I am done with the MSM including Fox News!
1325122260680765440 2020-11-08 01:05:41 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @CallingBSonU Agree with you completely!
1325116193250926594 2020-11-08 00:41:34 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @will_OC_Ca If he was the President by then we'd have a vaccine and it wouldn't be needed!
1325115802882859013 2020-11-08 00:40:01 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> PA conference by the legal team coming up soon, watching Newsmax.
1325115404906328067 2020-11-08 00:38:26 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> How many remain forever MAGNA?
1325114823873589248 2020-11-08 00:36:08 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> For those who feel that this election was a sham it is time for us to stand tall and strong for our President Trump. The legal team is going to need good reason to appeal but I believe we all know its there and they will find it. Plenty of whistle blowers have come out already!
1325114126629269504 2020-11-08 00:33:21 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> When the dust settles from this cluster vote of an election I expect we will expose the corrupt Democratic party and our President who was never accepted by them will retain his office.
1325113575673896961 2020-11-08 00:31:10 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> I plan to contact my two Senators in Missouri regarding their support for President Trump. I believe the rest of us need to do the same in their state to get additional support for President Trump. If they don't stand up for us now they don't deserve to be our representatives.
1325112415944650752 2020-11-08 00:26:34 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> President Trump needs the support of those in the Senate and we haven't seen it. Honestly it doesn't take a brain surgeon to see that this election was stolen by corruption. The RINO's seem to be increasing and we the people will not forget.
1325111702824816642 2020-11-08 00:23:43 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> I have heard where the GOP is not standing up strongly for President Trump and they were elected because of him. They must begin to stand up and be heard or they will find that they will not be re-elected by their constituents.

This would be a way to cheat that could of been hard to find and I salute Michigan for finding it!
1324800999052201987 2020-11-07 03:49:06 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @Jennyjen010 Very well said Jenny!üá∫üá∏

1324782935275458562 2020-11-07 02:37:19 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> I am going to boycott all news networks indefinitely.  If everyone did this the networks would feel it in their wallets and that is the only way to get to them. We all know that money talks, we have to hit them where it hurts!
1324769741861457920 2020-11-07 01:44:54 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Any of my followers going to Parler please let me know so I can follow you there. I can't take any more of this Twitter blocking Tweets!üá∫üá∏

1324751806921060353 2020-11-07 00:33:38 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> I can listen to Hannity on SiriusXM!
1324751546794549249 2020-11-07 00:32:36 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> I have been saying since BLM began that we were looking at a second American Revolution to keep this great country that our forefathers had fought. We are the laughing stock of the world after this sham election, and as a Vet I am pissed!
1324750055216156680 2020-11-07 00:26:40 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Fox is defending the election results and they are going to see their viewership go away.
1324749043109711874 2020-11-07 00:22:39 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @ACTBrigitte Never
1324746702352457728 2020-11-07 00:13:21 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> I have my Parler account and will be leaving here soon!
1324743339569283072 2020-11-06 23:59:59 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> This election is a sham, who in their right mind believes the American people elected Biden President. I don't know how this will turnout in the SCOTUS, but there will never be a healing of this country if this fraud is allowed to be carried out!
1324738917501931521 2020-11-06 23:42:25 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @megynkelly She is as crazy as ever, this election is a sham!
1324735822785093632 2020-11-06 23:30:07 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @aloverofblue That's why I set up my Parler account!

1324582310474297344 2020-11-06 13:20:07 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> No big loss with her she has been like that for months!

1324556331869704192 2020-11-06 11:36:53 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Georgia Trump lead down to 1800 votes, this is BS!

1324553660567867395 2020-11-06 11:26:16 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Obviously Hurd is a total dumb ass!
1324552468265635842 2020-11-06 11:21:32 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> My guess Lindsey is taking from his $500,000  political fund, and he actually said if 1 million American's sent in $5 that would be an additional 5 million for the legal fund!
1324550950988775425 2020-11-06 11:15:30 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @JVER1 @Trey_VonDinkis @GOPLeader @senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @GOP My guess from his political fund, and he actually said if 1 million sent in $5 that would be an additional 5 million for legal fund!
1324545628446359555 2020-11-06 10:54:21 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @JVER1 @Trey_VonDinkis @GOPLeader @senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @GOP Lindsey 30 minutes ago pledged $500,000 to the legal fund for President Trump. He stated President Trump got them all elected and they need to come out and support him!
1324538051436158976 2020-11-06 10:24:14 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @AngelWarrior321 @BDAINCBIZ FYI how will she get around section 230, just asking as I agree with Candace!
1324536760282550272 2020-11-06 10:19:07 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Both Georgia Senate Seats are now going to be a run off, that could take the GOP advantage away and open up the possible socialist agenda of the Dem's!
1324532122871320576 2020-11-06 10:00:41 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Just saw where when President Trump talked this evening that NBC, CBS, &amp; ABC cut away from it because they didn't like what he was saying! How do we live in a country where citizens fail to hear our president and the issues regarding this election filled with fraud!
1324513095956500480 2020-11-06 08:45:04 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @aloverofblue Amen sister!
1324481424469229569 2020-11-06 06:39:13 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Why in the Sec of State are they not asking her why the poll watchers are not allowed in?
1324479274259275777 2020-11-06 06:30:41 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Glad I don't live in PA and the corruption will be exposed and the criminals will be jailed and we know who they are!
1324478509377560578 2020-11-06 06:27:38 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> You can always tell when a dem is lying if their mouth is moving!
1324478355236945920 2020-11-06 06:27:02 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> PA Sec of State looks like she is scared to death and smiles to cover it up!  She has violated the law and should be held accountable.
1324477607690280960 2020-11-06 06:24:03 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> IF the MSM declares Biden the President elect I predict they will find it blow up in their faces!
1324477042549837825 2020-11-06 06:21:49 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Can't wait to see section 230 thrown out and Twitter, Facebook, and Google find out what the real world is like!
1324476626281893890 2020-11-06 06:20:09 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> The PA legislature is GOP and they need to and should of stood up regarding the election commission and some legal action against these individuals needs to be held responsible and prosecuted.
1324475482147049472 2020-11-06 06:15:37 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> PA has to be the most corrupt election counting system in the country.  The board of elections fails to follow a judges order. This is just one of the blue states that has issues but this one is the most corrupt and in plain site!
1324474286493573120 2020-11-06 06:10:52 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Agreed this has been going on for years!
1324473367274102786 2020-11-06 06:07:12 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> just turned on Fox to see the Republican News conference in PA and it then went to the 5, before I switched to Newsmax and Juan Williams had his s*** eating grin on his face. Fox has lost me I hit them for the news conference.

1324403153459138562 2020-11-06 01:28:12 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> It appears that the Dem's had ballots in reserve in battle ground states in the event that they were needed. Anyone who doesn't believe that would have to be brain dead!üá∫üá∏
1324402473600253952 2020-11-06 01:25:30 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> If anyone believes that part of this ballot stuffing was not to throw this election to Biden to throw off the corruption of him as a candidate. He is guilty of crimes against our country that need to be investigated and has been totally ignored by the MSM!üá∫üá∏
1324401681661046784 2020-11-06 01:22:21 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> The more that is exposed in this election one has to think that the results are fraudulent and for the sake of bring this country back together it needs to be redone! This may sound draconian but can anyone honestly believe that our country hasn't been severely damaged!üá∫üá∏
1324400091524927491 2020-11-06 01:16:02 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> We all went to the polls or voted absentee for President Trump because we rejected socialism. What we are seeing with this election is what socialism is famous and what the Dem's have caused by their totalitarian actions! If this is allowed we will have lost our country!üá∫üá∏
1324379049767161857 2020-11-05 23:52:25 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> This election appears to be the most corrupt in the history of this country. The election changes in the blue states with the issues made changes that are illegal and allowed for massive fraud. These issues are headed to the SCOTUS. üá∫üá∏

1324066836451872771 2020-11-05 03:11:48 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> It appears that fraud has occurred in several Blue states!
1324066664024055808 2020-11-05 03:11:07 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Fox is not reporting that the number of votes cast in Wisconsin is over 100,000 more than registered voters.
1324065268734316544 2020-11-05 03:05:34 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Since our History has been being erased this election will eventually be swept under the rug with all the monuments historical events way of life. Never thought I would ever be living in a country controlled by tyrants!
1324062061538824193 2020-11-05 02:52:50 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Assuming that the Dem's win the WH it makes me question the intelligence of the American people who voted for Biden. Elections have results but cheating has results also and I hope that they are all exposed! As a Vietnam Vet I am appalled that America has lost its compass!
1324058314897039366 2020-11-05 02:37:56 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Rush just said that in Michigan that 100,000 votes were found and all were for Biden, not one single one was for Trump!
1324051941782073346 2020-11-05 02:12:37 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @aloverofblue Have to say you look better than me after staying up till after 2am CST.‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏

1324050692340912128 2020-11-05 02:07:39 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Love the way that followers are falling and without my deleting those that I followed it makes no sense. Twitter must just delete both since my difference between the two did not change from yesterday. This is a database issue that can't be trusted!
1324047877358997504 2020-11-05 01:56:28 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> If Biden and I emphasize if he wins it will be the first time in history that a candidate with alzheimer's who has had his potential crimes hidden from the American people regarding China &amp; Russia payments to his son and himself. The MSM should be held responsible!
1324035808349868033 2020-11-05 01:08:30 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Its evident after last night that section 230 needs to be eliminated for Twitter, Facebook, and Google!
1323882750475149313 2020-11-04 15:00:18 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Looks like we won't know anything until tomorrow or later regarding the Presidental election in Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

1322227864243261440 2020-10-31 01:24:23 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> So Minnesota sets a cap on the Trump rally today to 250, then they should put a cap on Biden today to 2.5 people.

1321494336836669445 2020-10-29 00:49:36 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Joe Biden is spewing more false statements and trying to downplay the Coronavirus response of the Trump Administration. Joe needs to answer the questions regarding his corruption which is treason!

1321481797184741376 2020-10-28 23:59:47 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Jack Dorsey has truly made this a political statement by not unlocking the NY Posts account unless they delete the Hunter Biden laptop story which has not been proven to be false.

1316083837299052550 2020-10-14 02:30:13 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Biden is a Catholic in name only he doesn't follow the doctrines of the church and his stance on abortion is the most grievous.

1316081487293210624 2020-10-14 02:20:52 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Since Klobuchar brought up Biden is also Catholic lets set the record straight he is not in good standing with the church due to his stance on abortion. He is denied communion by priests and when he faces judgement will have to answer for all aborted due to his stance.‚úùÔ∏è

1310984851223465990 2020-09-30 00:48:40 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> So the Dem's think they can handle COVID better than President Trump. Just what would they of done different? I forgot Joe got his experience with H1n1 how did that go for him. Biden is a hipocrite who has no idea of what to do or how to implement a coherent plan!

1310981396475908096 2020-09-30 00:34:56 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> So today Sleepy Joe requests 2 breaks during tonights debate. President Trump says he doesn't need any breaks. I guess if Joe were President he would need breaks in matters of national security or meeting with heads of state.

1310678591252955136 2020-09-29 04:31:42 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Joe Biden has a long history of lying he has been playing the sympathy using his first wife who was killed after going through a stop sign and she and his 1 year old daughter killed. He said the driver of the semi was drunk a lie that he continues to state, he can't be trusted!
1310643373313789953 2020-09-29 02:11:45 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Is it just me or has Pelosi given the election to Trump by not passing the stimulis program and helping out the American people?

1307038730709020676 2020-09-19 03:28:11 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @LatulippeSteven Obviously Bill Gates is a flaming lib who is totally wrong with this dumb statement.
1307037687145213955 2020-09-19 03:24:02 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @DailDawson1 @crazycatkid I believe we may have a second American Revolution.

1307034679732834305 2020-09-19 03:12:05 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Trump press conference just started.
1307009312854859778 2020-09-19 01:31:17 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @RedWingGrips Good Question!
1307002509110710276 2020-09-19 01:04:15 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @EmeraldRobinson @MarisaInCali Bill is correct and he is greatly missed at Fox News, although with the new management at Fox supression is rampant!
1306997052795228161 2020-09-19 00:42:34 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @arnoldpeterso13 @BeverlyConserv1 Agreed!
1306996265507524608 2020-09-19 00:39:27 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Fox News needs to stop trying to block the truth from being said on their network.  The MSN lies constantly and no one says anything.  Newt is correct and anyone with half a brain knows Soros is backing non acting Prosecutors!üá∫üá∏
1306994626704945155 2020-09-19 00:32:56 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Dad shouldn't be outraged he should be embarassed that he wasn't a better parent!üá∫üá∏
1306992968763670534 2020-09-19 00:26:21 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> A leader wouldn't act a Pelosi and the Dem's up for re-election will feel the pain at the polls on November 3rd, GOP will retake the house and toss out the wicked witch!
1306992455976284164 2020-09-19 00:24:18 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Pelosi is not fiscially responsible and doesn't want to make a deal with the GOP. She is hurting so many people and as a multimillionaire she could care less. Her blowout was just one example of her thinking she is a queen!
1306991782031511556 2020-09-19 00:21:38 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> So Pelosi will not budge on the stimulis numbers, I guess she wants to see President Trump win as the American people are not blind when she act like a banchee child. She must want to lose the House strictly due to her!
1306807250695094277 2020-09-18 12:08:22 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> @BlessUSA45 @DexterQuad Guess she needs to be fired, but not in the lib world.

1305988508746764289 2020-09-16 05:54:59 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> I hope that the American people can see through the Dem's Socialist adgenda and Vote for to re-elect the best President we have had since Ronald Reagan.üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏

1305983101890433024 2020-09-16 05:33:30 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Pelosi on Peace Deal today a distraction from the Coronavirus, this woman there is not a word in our dictionary to describe her that is bad enough!
1305981224129830914 2020-09-16 05:26:02 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Now this tells us how the Dem's are approaching this election!  Remind anyone of Killary?   https://t.co/j8p05awLRH

1305933246862176256 2020-09-16 02:15:23 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> As a senior I can't see how seniors are polling for Biden considering compared to President Trump he hasn't accomplished a small fraction. Biden will hurt all seniors children and grandchildren with their socialist liberal platform. I can't believe they have failed to see this!
1305932074256404484 2020-09-16 02:10:44 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Time to tun off the TV and turn on the record player or crank up the old phonograph.  Like I still have a relic like these in 2020!
1305931013579780097 2020-09-16 02:06:31 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Biden giving the same old speech on vets and repeaating his comments on President calling Vet's suckers and loosers.  I guess when you can't get any proof of a statement Biden thinks it will help him.  Sorry Joe as a Vietnam Vet President Trump has done more for Vets than anyone!
1305924655165902848 2020-09-16 01:41:15 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> I guess Biden will come out of the basement and criticize President Trump again today with another one of his hateful comments written for him!
1305922604910497792 2020-09-16 01:33:06 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> I guess the MSN story on today's signing will be that they didn't practice social distancing!

1305567491385630720 2020-09-15 02:02:00 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Any person who has a brain will see that Biden is following the liberal paybook, gun control, green deal, hell the sky is falling!
1305565804897787904 2020-09-15 01:55:18 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Joe Biden has a new thing to blame on Trump Climate Change, he has missed the boat totally and if you want to see if he's lieing just look to see if his lips are moving and he has a teleprompter to read from.
1305564962899800066 2020-09-15 01:51:58 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Truth alert2: Someone tell Joe that the heat he was taking about we had before airconditioning and has nothing to do with Global Warming.  Also, make him aware that Huricanes have been occurring since annually and they are not from Global Warming.

1304110477056847879 2020-09-11 01:32:21 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Trump is not to blame for not causing a Panic with COVID.  Woodward saw an opportunity before his book launch and he stepped into a buzzsaw.  Can anyone honestly say they wanted to see a full out Panic in the USA?

1301934689922551818 2020-09-05 01:26:33 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> Notice that the reporters are not wearing their masks. He continually is looking down I am sure that he had these questions before and the answers are written out. Calling Barr bad seals it only the OBAMA AG's were credible.
1301932932614041603 2020-09-05 01:19:34 +0800 <TrumanSECMUTgr> I may be an old fart but I will expose this hipocrite Biden for his ignorance. He barely graduated from law school and cheated his way and was caught and was almost expelled! Look it up this is the truth.
