1326425585812459523 2020-11-11 15:24:38 +0800 <pop_lo> 2- Once all this is settled and a POTUS elect is certified, President Trump EITHER WAY needs to immediately have the DOJ charge Biden with violating the Logan Act!  I don't care if he won or lost, charge Biden's ass before January 20.
1326425540652392450 2020-11-11 15:24:27 +0800 <pop_lo> 1- Flynn's ordeal was started due to a "Logan Act" violation. Well, Trump was certified by the states as POTUS elect when that phone call happened. Biden has NOT been certified as POTUS elect and is talking to world leaders, CLEAR violation of the Logan Act.

Not overly impressed. I think POTUS restrained himself well tonight but still let  Trump come out and play. POTUS massacred Biden tonight, not even close. Not being bias.
