1343553668126273538 2020-12-28 21:45:31 +0800 <DefenceGeek> CORRECTION: N163PA has now altered course and is on heading 336, possibly heading back to Ramstein? @AuroraIntel @no_itsmyturn @Osinttechnical
1343552505083527168 2020-12-28 21:40:53 +0800 <DefenceGeek> N163PA (callsign PHA120) has now departed Erbil and is heading back towards Baghdad #Iraq! The aircraft arrived at Baghdad earlier today from Ramstein #Germany before going to Erbil, and is now heading back to Baghdad International. Very strange behaviour from the #US aircraft
1343550653864538118 2020-12-28 21:33:32 +0800 <DefenceGeek> Quick turnaround for #UK RAF A400M "Atlas" ZM408 in the #UAE. Using callsign RRR9942 it departed 13:22 squawking 0565.  https://t.co/Hr8JIjozFz
1343539151484968968 2020-12-28 20:47:50 +0800 <DefenceGeek> Update regarding N163PA. Spent probably an hour on the ground at Baghdad having flown in from Ramstein, now it has flown to Erbil and landed there. One worth watching considering this particular airframe normally frequents Washington Dulles.

1343293838996221954 2020-12-28 04:33:03 +0800 <DefenceGeek> Worth saying we're approaching the 1st anniversary of the assassination... there's been plenty of threats in the 12 months since the incident, but very little more than words (and the occassional rocket attack). If they are indeed going to respond, they will have to go big

1343259675261808644 2020-12-28 02:17:17 +0800 <DefenceGeek> That's interesting... wonder if that means more activity on the ground in Iraq tonight after last night being so quiet...

1343157894720741376 2020-12-27 19:32:51 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @PC_Angry Definitely needs to be a close look at a) why companies are charging the NHS ridiculous amounts for stuff, b) why equipment can't be cleaned and used for another patient (thinking crutches, etc.) And c) is the NHS getting a little too top heavy? Too many managers?

1342913451237269504 2020-12-27 03:21:31 +0800 <DefenceGeek> #US KC-135R 63-8024 is currently flying a strange pattern over Mosul, seemingly in support of fast-jets I can't see which may be operating in aid of two Beechcraft 350 ISRs that are doing orbits just out to the North-West of Erbil #Iraq.
1342911094717870080 2020-12-27 03:12:09 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @no_itsmyturn No... it's been flying along the coast and UAE border, now past Bahrain still heading North

1342901932747317248 2020-12-27 02:35:45 +0800 <DefenceGeek> UPDATE 18:30Z. Add to the above 1 additional KC-135R (63-7995) and a P-8A Poseidon (5791). Two of the KC-135s that were to the north of Baghdad (KC-135T 60-0335 and one KC-135R) have now disappeared off our trackers around Erbil/Mosul.

1342823789869064192 2020-12-26 21:25:14 +0800 <DefenceGeek> So my final tally for the aircraft tracked last night (huge thanks to @Osinttechnical @no_itsmyturn @air_intel for the help with that), we spotted the following #US assets over #Iraq: (1) KC-135T (14) KC-135R (2) KC-10A (1) E-3B (1) E-11A (1) E-8C (1) EC-130H (1) MC-12W (3) F-16C

1342744740681416704 2020-12-26 16:11:07 +0800 <DefenceGeek> So these next 7-10 days will be key... and I know @air_intel @Osinttechnical @skywatcherintel @no_itsmyturn, myself and others will be watching the region closely. Will the US show of force last night deter Iran and its proxies? Only time will tell... 8/ ---- THREAD END ----

I would suggest that with the number of tankers airborne at once, there was probably at least two dozen additional fast-jets involved, although where they flew over Iraq will for now remain a mystery. The US was sending a message - that much we do know. 5/

1342744728878637056 2020-12-26 16:11:05 +0800 <DefenceGeek> We witnessed a number of intelligence gathering aircraft (E-8C, MC-12W, E-3B, Sentinel R.1) alongside a significant number of tanker aircraft (KC-10A and KC-135R/T) take to the skies, mainly from Al-Udeid Airbase and fly up to Iraqi airspace.

1342744727448334337 2020-12-26 16:11:04 +0800 <DefenceGeek> POST-INCIDENT ANALYSIS: Clearly we witnessed quite a significant movement of #US Air assets over #Iraq last night, with the number of assets comparable to when a mainland US airbase is evacuated before the arrival of a Hurricane. Weather played no part in last night however... 1/
1342621189232066561 2020-12-26 08:00:10 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @JmeDubya Similar yes. That's a Saab 340 AEW&amp;C though i believe. The Saab 2000 is a bit larger
1342620548149501952 2020-12-26 07:57:38 +0800 <DefenceGeek> Right... well it's almost midnight and things didn't kick off in Iraq so i'm gonna head to bed. Will keep an eye on things and probably throw some thoughts out tomorrow once i've had a chance to catch up on everything that's happened this evening.  Merry Christmas everyone!
1342618584883847170 2020-12-26 07:49:49 +0800 <DefenceGeek> Another track of interest this evening was a #Saudi Saab 2000 Erieye using callsign YELOW51. Still airborne flying some sort of pattern along the edge of the Persian Gulf  https://t.co/8YXunzd8pw
1342617107972972545 2020-12-26 07:43:57 +0800 <DefenceGeek> One of the KC-135s we were tracking earlier this evening, the sole KC-135T variant detected tonight is now tracking south over #Iraq again  https://t.co/Z5eF8PzdLF
1342612716544995328 2020-12-26 07:26:30 +0800 <DefenceGeek> So according to the number of notifications on my phone i just passed 1k followers. Thanks to you all! Hope you find the content interesting!!! See my profile for a link to the UKDJ Discord server whre we're having all the fun tonight!
1342611453904347136 2020-12-26 07:21:29 +0800 <DefenceGeek> UPDATE: 2320Z. While things do seem to have got quiet over #Iraq, we have now noticed an E-8C J-STARS and E-11A BACN to add to our list @air_intel @skywatcherintel @Osinttechnical @no_itsmyturn  https://t.co/jsApCXhF9v

1342582096003543045 2020-12-26 05:24:50 +0800 <DefenceGeek> Ok so we know we have the following tankers up over #Iraq and the surrounding area right now KC-135s: 58-0065, 62-3578, 58-0066, 63-8019, 60-0353, 63-8007, 58-0061, 58-0065, 60-0366, 63-8003 and KC-10A 86-0028

1342573791881388032 2020-12-26 04:51:50 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @vcdgf555 Flights were temporarily halted out of Doha from what im hearing while F-15s scrambled... attempting to verify

1342205621739905024 2020-12-25 04:28:51 +0800 <DefenceGeek> Translation: We're annoyed they don't want to give us more money and tie their Armed Forces into our EU Defence Forces plans...
1342124413819482112 2020-12-24 23:06:10 +0800 <DefenceGeek> I give Twitter exactly 10 seconds to begin exploding, and Sturgeon until Sunday to demand a 2nd Independence referendum

1342023959164968960 2020-12-24 16:27:00 +0800 <DefenceGeek> We all knew it was gonna happen... deal or no, the EU wasn't going to let go without a fight - the UK is too valuable to them and if it succeeds outside the EU, that'll be at least one nail in the EU's coffin...

1341132672958132225 2020-12-22 05:25:20 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @skywatcherintel Well nobody is suggesting firing all 200 cruise missiles at once 😂
1341132201438703623 2020-12-22 05:23:28 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @skywatcherintel Possibly a backup option - bear in mind the Apache helicopters  are based out of Baghdad International Airport which isn't far from the US Embassy - if a major rocket attack occurs again, it's possible Baghdad airport gets hit too
1341130208771010564 2020-12-22 05:15:33 +0800 <DefenceGeek> Wonder if the arrival of two Ticonderoga-class CGs and an Ohio-class SSGN (USS Georgia) in the Persian Gulf today is part of this rumoured response

1339221495688671233 2020-12-16 22:51:00 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @vcdgf555 I agree with you... weaponizing space would be restarting work on the "star wars" satellite and space-based missiles idea

1338455599022039046 2020-12-14 20:07:36 +0800 <DefenceGeek> YouTube, Discord and Gmail reportedly down or bugged across a large portion of Europe this morning. Not clear what's causing it. YouTube and Gmail reportedly also affected in India
1338442682654453760 2020-12-14 19:16:17 +0800 <DefenceGeek> Very exciting concept!
1338400222024790016 2020-12-14 16:27:33 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @manniefabian Happy Birthday!
1338072125484175360 2020-12-13 18:43:49 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @Altern8rv SkyNews had an article titled "Britain should be very worried about a no-deal Brexit, ex-security chief says".... failing to mention of course that the ex-security chief is former head of Europol... so isn't really a security chief and is getting his pension from the EU...

1335652958348972032 2020-12-07 02:30:55 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @IntelKirby Are they naval boats? Article reads like they were a tanker and some solid goods vessels
1335338849401270278 2020-12-06 05:42:45 +0800 <DefenceGeek> I see games night is going well... reminds me of the time my sister told the family (during a game of Risk) that Afghanistan was invading Canada...

1334958011102752768 2020-12-05 04:29:26 +0800 <DefenceGeek> So he's basically stood for and won the Presidential election but will hand over to Kamala Harris with very little resistance if "there's a fundamental disagreement"... oh dear....
1334921367892979714 2020-12-05 02:03:50 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @vcdgf555 A B-52H did squawk 7700 and land in the UK yesterday after an engine failure apparently... callsign was "CAKE11".
1334258069937786881 2020-12-03 06:08:07 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @geoallison @PC_Angry Yeah that makes sense. I do feel for the officers... terrorism threat level is severe, recently a police station got rammed and the guy wasn't being very forthcoming with them!
1334255139398496263 2020-12-03 05:56:29 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @PC_Angry @geoallison With the number of attacks on police and the recent ramming of a police station... imo the officers were entirely justified to challenge him. As for needing ID as a journalist... pretty sure people are meant to show their "PRESS" ID cards if asked to?
1334248785690628097 2020-12-03 05:31:14 +0800 <DefenceGeek> And here we have an example of someone who makes less sense (and knows less) than a monkey with a typewriter... #DefenceKnowledgeFails

1327607424212226049 2020-11-14 21:40:50 +0800 <DefenceGeek> Still believe R09 of the QE-class should have been named HMS Ark Royal...

1326630749777375234 2020-11-12 04:59:53 +0800 <DefenceGeek> Please do NOT assume it's terrorism or claim such until the MPS issues a statement to confirm or deny it!! Don't make a bad situation worse!
1326630457518272513 2020-11-12 04:58:43 +0800 <DefenceGeek> I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH. The Met Police has not indicated if this is a terrorist incident at Edmonton police station tonight. It does appear to be a deliberate attack on the station given the videos currently pouring out online. Please avoid the area. Hope the officers are ok!

1325850260657344513 2020-11-10 01:18:29 +0800 <DefenceGeek> All you folks getting pissed off at someone calling Kamala Harris an Indian do realise her mother is "Indian-American" and her father "Jamaican-American"... so technically the guy who made the statement isn't wrong... she has Indian heritage

1310961782287200262 2020-09-29 23:17:00 +0800 <DefenceGeek> Explains the tweets that were seen earlier from several key figures...

1309954412501229571 2020-09-27 04:34:04 +0800 <DefenceGeek> Awesome!
1309424218988257280 2020-09-25 17:27:16 +0800 <DefenceGeek> So saddened to hear of the death of a colleague in Croydon this morning... thoughts and prayers with the family and team there. #thinblueline #BackTheBlue  https://t.co/NiGzL3XaoR
1308719582333603841 2020-09-23 18:47:17 +0800 <DefenceGeek> And to think we once had at least 7 E-3D Sentry aircraft on inventory...
1307717965102624768 2020-09-21 00:27:13 +0800 <DefenceGeek> Good job 2020...  https://t.co/ZWlCUGRjBM
1307021861377716225 2020-09-19 02:21:09 +0800 <DefenceGeek> Shows it isn't just the news agencies that can't tell the difference between types of aircraft/tanks/firearms/[insert other military kit type]...
1307021304034459648 2020-09-19 02:18:56 +0800 <DefenceGeek> I sat here and read these in several different directions and was admittedly a tad annoyed it made sense every time 😂  Nice cutout though!
1306581570720083969 2020-09-17 21:11:36 +0800 <DefenceGeek> So it looks like Overclockers UK and several other sites crashed dead on 2pm as everyone rushed to go buy an #RTX3080 lol! Can't say I didn't see it coming but hey ho...  Oh also apparently the #PS5 has already sold out in most places here in the UK too...
1305844779738071040 2020-09-15 20:23:51 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @KyleJGlen Unless you're the teacher on playground duty 😂

1304838266953310213 2020-09-13 01:44:20 +0800 <DefenceGeek> Wow... never seen that before...

1303720949934624769 2020-09-09 23:44:31 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @mrdavidboberesq @thinkdefence Donald's been nominated twice now too. First time was after the summit with North Korea in the Philippines
1303658322298580992 2020-09-09 19:35:39 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @Archer83Able @PBondaryk Yeah these were tracked deploying there on the day everyone was watching the B-52 flight of three over Ukraine
1303656502104907777 2020-09-09 19:28:25 +0800 <DefenceGeek> Another example of a misleading headline... he didn't find out about the aircraft swap until after he arrived in Oman, and is "furious". Headline makes it sound like he made the decision... good job from another rubbish newspaper
1302486737726459904 2020-09-06 14:00:11 +0800 <DefenceGeek>  https://t.co/BgjiBi6NKQ @air_intel you got a mention!
1301900171865882626 2020-09-04 23:09:23 +0800 <DefenceGeek> So we've had #US B-52Hs down near #Ukraine. #UK Typhoons, Sentinel and Airseeker operating nearby. #Portuguese F-16AMs heading past Kaliningrad. A BBMF Lancaster squawking 7700 and a supposed shoot-down of an Su-35S in #China. Have I missed anything so far today?
1301883047940362241 2020-09-04 22:01:21 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @vcdgf555 Oh god... i hope it isn't serious
1301872988183240710 2020-09-04 21:21:22 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @UKDefJournal Omani Air maybe... or someone who's a whole other level of confused
1301862711400300546 2020-09-04 20:40:32 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @vcdgf555 @Simon85205764 Is there any relevance to the use of JULIA in the callsigns? E.g. perhaps a reference to something that i'm too young and British to understand? Or is it just completely random?
1301130369312358401 2020-09-02 20:10:28 +0800 <DefenceGeek> Some parts of the media need their heads examined...
1301126120327262208 2020-09-02 19:53:35 +0800 <DefenceGeek> Well... only around half the nation voted for him... so not really news is it?
1300868077941403648 2020-09-02 02:48:13 +0800 <DefenceGeek> 6 hours later... and it's still up... sort out your double standards @Twitter @jack
1300835117120843777 2020-09-02 00:37:14 +0800 <DefenceGeek> @KyleJGlen lol I've got Ryanair and Extinction Rebellion trending in my area of the UK...
