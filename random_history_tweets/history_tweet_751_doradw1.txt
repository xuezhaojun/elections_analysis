1312107484794908672 2020-10-03 03:09:36 +0800 <doradw1> @imbdennis @costareports They would if they are assholes.
1312101545765269504 2020-10-03 02:46:00 +0800 <doradw1> @GrabberGrabber @PalmerReport Absolutely. The whole thing is probably cooked up. It would certainly be to his advantage.
1312098404961378304 2020-10-03 02:33:32 +0800 <doradw1> @PalmerReport Always expect the worse from Trump. He never disappoints.
1311865706112315392 2020-10-02 11:08:52 +0800 <doradw1> @SenTedCruz Anyone driving the train would be better then who we have now.

1311716801458434054 2020-10-02 01:17:10 +0800 <doradw1> @AprilDRyan President Carter May be our best example of our savior Jesus Christ that we have now. We would be smart to follow his example. He surely walks the talk.

1311687416110088195 2020-10-01 23:20:24 +0800 <doradw1> @lbarronlopez Trump thinks he can get rid of ballots like he thought he could get rid of  COVID-19. Howâ€™d that work out for him?
1311330208742604803 2020-09-30 23:40:59 +0800 <doradw1> @AOC @FluffyDoom You go girl!! Shame Kellyanne is not smart enough to figure it out herself.
1311301424962306048 2020-09-30 21:46:37 +0800 <doradw1> @KaivanShroff @StoopsThe Thatâ€™s nothing new. Anyone with half a mind knows that.

1310005708482633728 2020-09-27 07:57:54 +0800 <doradw1> @DunkAsASkunk @Hickenlooper Gardner learned from the lying expert.
1309962802845675523 2020-09-27 05:07:24 +0800 <doradw1> @870South Wait until Mary Trump gets finishing with his daddy.
1309290895121014789 2020-09-25 08:37:29 +0800 <doradw1> @noneejudi @ChuckGrassley As long as they can justify it in their minds itâ€™s ok and they donâ€™t have to think about it anymore.
1309288113370431489 2020-09-25 08:26:26 +0800 <doradw1> @the_bashjackson @ChuckGrassley One would think so.
1308524401692946433 2020-09-23 05:51:43 +0800 <doradw1> @BobSmokeyPeters @realTuckFrumper Everyone feared waking Hitler up too. He was also a drug addict.

1308429543779250177 2020-09-22 23:34:47 +0800 <doradw1> @tomwatson @TessaLightsItUp Thatâ€™s a big part of it but I think Trumps holding things over their heads.
1308149805525405707 2020-09-22 05:03:12 +0800 <doradw1> @Jailbird_Jack @mattklewis I donâ€™t think they will get rid of it.  If they get rid of abortion a big majority of votes go away. They talk a good talk but I donâ€™t think they will ever get rid of it.
1307823977600102400 2020-09-21 07:28:29 +0800 <doradw1> @MojackMarine Was he white? Iâ€™m wondering why he wasnâ€™t killed.
1307791966160203778 2020-09-21 05:21:16 +0800 <doradw1> @makingnonoise1 @essenviews @realDonaldTrump Correction. Donald J.Trump doesnâ€™t work period. Others do his work and cover for him.
1307403308521455616 2020-09-20 03:36:53 +0800 <doradw1> @B52Malmet @davidsongc Oh but they are making a killing off our taxes.

1306743309910540288 2020-09-18 07:54:17 +0800 <doradw1> @makeupuface @B52Malmet Donâ€™t forget the blatant ignorance of these people. Really the only things these people know about in the constitution is gun laws.
1306394572801671173 2020-09-17 08:48:32 +0800 <doradw1> @rboc15 @danielsgoldman Now would be a good time to ask him if heâ€™s aware that blue states pay more taxes than red. I would like to see what he comes up with.
1305593674567421954 2020-09-15 03:46:03 +0800 <doradw1> @ClawedReins @AmyMcGrathKY @cynthiakiker That would be hard if you havenâ€™t studied enough history to know what any of those centuries were like.

1304620201426792449 2020-09-12 11:17:49 +0800 <doradw1> @atrupar Always accuse others of what you are doing. This tells me without a doubt Trump is using.
1304515939178811395 2020-09-12 04:23:31 +0800 <doradw1> @ConfusedMillen4 @RadioFreeTom @realchriswilson @CharlotteAlter @Tracinski I am not highly educated but realize how important it is and is the only reason for anyone to believe this stuff. I would have to see it with my own eyes. This is some crazy shit.
1304285284461424640 2020-09-11 13:06:58 +0800 <doradw1> @SiegelAtty @JournalistJG Yes and I always think of Timothy McVeigh.
1304280227934240768 2020-09-11 12:46:53 +0800 <doradw1> @TeaPainUSA @JournalistJG Trump rarely smiles but he seems quite happy in this picture.
1304277150573395968 2020-09-11 12:34:39 +0800 <doradw1> @JohnWDean @UROCKlive1 Very insightful. Itâ€™s worth the read.
1304195485167693824 2020-09-11 07:10:09 +0800 <doradw1> @GerryConnolly @InactionNever I guess nothing he has ever done surprises me. I just wait for the next crisis. It will happen.
1304191104951169024 2020-09-11 06:52:44 +0800 <doradw1> @BearroristJodi Iâ€™m glad you are getting help. One thing to remember is to just keep on keeping on. One day at a time is all any of us can do.
1304151605965664258 2020-09-11 04:15:47 +0800 <doradw1> @Ky_Gill28 @56blackcat You win the internet today with your statement. I think it everyday.
1304146728468320262 2020-09-11 03:56:24 +0800 <doradw1> @RadioFreeTom Who said the words? Sir you have no shame!
1304136118154264581 2020-09-11 03:14:14 +0800 <doradw1> @EWErickson What does that have to do with it? It was his responsibility to us regardless of the outcome.
1303909498592137216 2020-09-10 12:13:44 +0800 <doradw1> @outofcontroljb @realDonaldTrump If you say it enough they believe it. Who said that again?
1303904466022924289 2020-09-10 11:53:44 +0800 <doradw1> @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Could this be the reason when Trump lies which he does without knowing and denies it enough he thinks people will believe him?
1303849493616644096 2020-09-10 08:15:18 +0800 <doradw1> @Mike_Pence @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Oh Mike, I donâ€™t need Anyone to tell me to trust anything this President says. Give me one reason to take a vaccine that he says is safe.?
1303845897235836928 2020-09-10 08:01:00 +0800 <doradw1> @Sherry033048 @HarperDJ @MeliMels99 I donâ€™t look for her to drop the case. I think she knows how important this is for all women who have had this happen to them and maybe stop it for younger ones.
1303840083611717636 2020-09-10 07:37:54 +0800 <doradw1> @TIsanasshole @Benjaminknorr79 We canâ€™t always control our feelings . Just replace negative to positive and eventually you wonâ€™t even be thinking about it. Something like I would rather be 40 than not live to be 40. Being thankful helps a lot.
1303825140598398976 2020-09-10 06:38:32 +0800 <doradw1> @sarahcpr @reconsidered Thatâ€™s a good one.
1303820953164697600 2020-09-10 06:21:53 +0800 <doradw1> @Solid_Believer What a wonderful truth. I think we know more when we study his God-Breath word and have a greater understanding and the way we do it is through study.
1303818618648621056 2020-09-10 06:12:37 +0800 <doradw1> @Bill_Maxwell_ Thank God I knew it would be ok.

1303555121310298115 2020-09-09 12:45:34 +0800 <doradw1> @Bill_Maxwell_ I donâ€™t know but we might find out sooner than later. Give the Don time and heâ€™ll throw him under the bus like everyone else.
1303537495125168130 2020-09-09 11:35:32 +0800 <doradw1> @ejeancarroll @realDonaldTrump @kaplanrobbie I have a feeling he just might be sorry he messed with you.

1303514642111778816 2020-09-09 10:04:43 +0800 <doradw1> @duty2warn Iâ€™d say heâ€™s lying.
1303511982658772997 2020-09-09 09:54:09 +0800 <doradw1> @Bill_Maxwell_ Knowing the way you take care of your child from reading your tweets Iâ€™m certain it wonâ€™t be as bad as you think.
1303494133303177217 2020-09-09 08:43:13 +0800 <doradw1> @jstorres Abraham Lincoln understood the meaning of love. Matt 22 : 36-40

1303145781659140097 2020-09-08 09:39:00 +0800 <doradw1> @FPWellman @atdavidhoffman What Trump said today is right out of Hitlers play book. He knows he canâ€™t get rid of the top Brass himself but he gets the ones under them to mistrust them he has his own soldiers.
1302850086666473473 2020-09-07 14:04:01 +0800 <doradw1> @IslandGirlPRV @OleVetUSAF One thingâ€™s for sure if she wanted to be noticed she bought the right dress.
1302837528899268609 2020-09-07 13:14:07 +0800 <doradw1> @kelly14858906 Just make yourself stay busy. You wonâ€™t feel any worse and at least you are getting things done. Itâ€™s not easy but it keeps your mind off of it.

1302467383399981056 2020-09-06 12:43:17 +0800 <doradw1> @palazzo214 @Pervaizistan Your statement is so so true.

1302438236015517697 2020-09-06 10:47:28 +0800 <doradw1> @eugenegu You can say that again only louder.
1302418188806873089 2020-09-06 09:27:48 +0800 <doradw1> @billybangu2 @DanRather Trump is always happiest when Putin is around.

1302412135641870336 2020-09-06 09:03:45 +0800 <doradw1> @Bill_Maxwell_ Iâ€™m so happy for you. Shows what a great father you are and how wonderful your son must think you to be. Our children are the best thing our Heavenly Father gave us except His Son Jesus Christ.
1302351885257650178 2020-09-06 05:04:20 +0800 <doradw1> @mjgutowski @realDonaldTrump What reason would I have to not believe the reporting? Trump did exactly what they said he did and truth be known he said more.
1301753785384087553 2020-09-04 13:27:42 +0800 <doradw1> @JHoganGidley I thought Trump ruled to let the prisoners out.
1301353912411336705 2020-09-03 10:58:45 +0800 <doradw1> @MTC_CO @EvanMcMullin Traitors is the answer.
1301342265747615744 2020-09-03 10:12:28 +0800 <doradw1> @ChestyPullar @ericswalwell @realDonaldTrump They use Mitch McConnell to get away with it.
1301341050846564352 2020-09-03 10:07:38 +0800 <doradw1> @ChestyPullar @ericswalwell @realDonaldTrump Little Donnie loves to have people clean up his messes. Barr is the brainâ€™s behind everything Trump whines about. Little Donnie still lets someone clean up his messes like he did when his father was alive. He still thinks heâ€™s four years old.
1301241663122296834 2020-09-03 03:32:43 +0800 <doradw1> @Amy_Siskind Who said after the republicans won the election that the democrats would be voted in to clean it up. Does anyone know how long democrats have been getting the deficit back in order after republican election s? Look it up.
1301164824399933441 2020-09-02 22:27:23 +0800 <doradw1> @Politicalindep2 @ABCPolitics Until you donâ€™t. Iâ€™m thinking about how long it will take Putin to poison Trump if he loses the election. Trumps not as savvy as Putin.
1301160546763444224 2020-09-02 22:10:23 +0800 <doradw1> @drsimonegold If Trump pushes it nobody believes it because of his lies. Good luck getting anyone to believe you on this.

1300960548775956483 2020-09-02 08:55:40 +0800 <doradw1> @ResisterForever @realDonaldTrump Until they donâ€™t.

1300655537391046658 2020-09-01 12:43:39 +0800 <doradw1> @DeaconBlues0 She may be in prison by then.
