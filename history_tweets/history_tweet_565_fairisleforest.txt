1331321407989370880 2020-11-25 03:38:53 +0800 <fairisleforest> @PatriciaGrid @Iwobrand To me, Ingrid is so strongly Scandinavian I almost feel it inappropriate because I‚Äôm only German. It‚Äôs strong &amp; pretty. Tamsin is firmly a magical &amp; cottage-y Welsh/Cornish name.

1331317623737380865 2020-11-25 03:23:50 +0800 <fairisleforest> @daudiulv But when our ancestors make names their own, they become meaningful. I think the Martha is beautiful, &amp; Caroline is so classic &amp; meaningful. ‚ÄúCaro‚Äù is my favorite nickname for it.

Maybe if I use Ingrid for a child I‚Äôd name a pet Tamsin, or use it for a middle. :)  /  I love honor names. I am very partial to the name Marie for ancestral reasons, even though I would prefer something with different roots.
1331316849565261824 2020-11-25 03:20:46 +0800 <fairisleforest> @Gror_longbeard @dodbjorn I found it! Congratulations on your sons to come.

1331309871799549952 2020-11-25 02:53:02 +0800 <fairisleforest> @Gror_longbeard Oh I wish I could find your post! I‚Äôm always wanting to see people discussing names. üòÖ There‚Äôs a story in each one. It really is a meaningful decision and an honor to name someone.

1331308145298210816 2020-11-25 02:46:11 +0800 <fairisleforest> @mortepervita I find different types to have markedly different flavor profiles. The classic canned black ones are not my favorite. I love green olives. If you can try castelvetrano olives I highly recommend! They are sort of buttery, nutty, sweet. The best ones I ever had were ocean-y!

1331307246140104705 2020-11-25 02:42:36 +0800 <fairisleforest> @bxscxn I love sites like Behind The Name (Germanic name elements!!) &amp; various medieval name roll sites. What are a few of your favorite names, if you feel like sharing?
1331306970637209600 2020-11-25 02:41:30 +0800 <fairisleforest> @bxscxn I‚Äôve had lists of baby names since I was about 4 or 5! I also used to like to make up names and make lists of those. These days the etymological/cultural roots &amp; historical use are what interest me. I also have distinct preferences for sounds/letters in names.
1331306018249142272 2020-11-25 02:37:43 +0800 <fairisleforest> @mortepervita Sacrilege......! No, I get it. ;) They are a divisive food with such a distinct taste.

1304954413962817537 2020-09-13 09:25:51 +0800 <fairisleforest> @tendermoonfairy Apologies for these irritating screenshots (hard to get on my phone w/the site‚Äôs layout), but FWIW (&amp; I don‚Äôt know the true accuracy) here is how specific Living DNA is. Fun in any case.  https://t.co/Cfeguc2xtE
1304940166880976897 2020-09-13 08:29:15 +0800 <fairisleforest> @Astro_Fash I gave up most of my interest in astrology many years ago, but I‚Äôd still be very interested to see how you interpret my chart! I only came at it from a very SJW perspective before. If you clear your backlog &amp; are taking new requests I‚Äôd enjoy being a client.
1304937383696031745 2020-09-13 08:18:11 +0800 <fairisleforest> @tendermoonfairy I thought it was interesting they all picked up some % of S.Europe, which I don‚Äôt have any specific knowledge of. It could be from different (now) Spanish populations coming to the Isles or it could be because I am part Swiss (near enough Italy) or both. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1304936933533999109 2020-09-13 08:16:24 +0800 <fairisleforest> @tendermoonfairy DNA companies struggle with differentiating between German, French, &amp; English DNA. 23andMe is likely most accurate in my case, though I think the most accurate % lies somewhere between Living DNA &amp; 23andMe.
1304936052826669056 2020-09-13 08:12:54 +0800 <fairisleforest> @tendermoonfairy Living DNA is supposed to be particularly good for a English DNA, &amp; gets into the regions. I‚Äôll see if I can get a screenshot of my regions. PS ‚Äî Sorry if you get this response many times! Was having internet issues.
1304935681693634561 2020-09-13 08:11:25 +0800 <fairisleforest> @tendermoonfairy They are fun to do! Have you done any others? I‚Äôll post mine from the same company &amp; also 23andMe &amp; Living DNA (in this order) so you can see how differently they interpret the same DNA.  https://t.co/czJXABFGuP

1302724709465821184 2020-09-07 05:45:48 +0800 <fairisleforest> @DionysiusElf @wonder_plants I‚Äôve felt the same effect with valerian so I wish you the very best! It is truly calming, but I‚Äôm very curious about this effect of only working for a certain period of time. Maybe it‚Äôs the body‚Äôs way of saying it is not for daily use, but rather occasional.
1302724239791763456 2020-09-07 05:43:56 +0800 <fairisleforest> @wonder_plants How wonderful that etymological connection.
1302724054453948416 2020-09-07 05:43:12 +0800 <fairisleforest> @wonder_plants I love dill!! One of my favorite tastes on this earth. It is ancient &amp; soothing. I didn‚Äôt know of its use for children‚Äîbut it makes sense. I like to give children fennel, so effective.
1302723470388649985 2020-09-07 05:40:53 +0800 <fairisleforest> @DionysiusElf @wonder_plants Try alternating passionflower &amp; valerian, maybe this would help. (1 week-passiflora extract, 1 week-valeriana‚Äîrepeat)
1302722517627318272 2020-09-07 05:37:06 +0800 <fairisleforest> @CachetMarie Have you ever written about the name Marie? Like many, I have a Mary in my family ‚Äî my grandmother. I have seen many perspectives and etymologies on/for this name but would love to be pointed to yours if you‚Äôve written on it.
1302701806821146624 2020-09-07 04:14:48 +0800 <fairisleforest> @Trad_West_Art I love the second photo.
1302700212947828736 2020-09-07 04:08:28 +0800 <fairisleforest> @Grimniu @LiguresAmbrones Yeah, I wish it was more exact. I‚Äôd love to see more of what I really am.

1302397427601661953 2020-09-06 08:05:18 +0800 <fairisleforest> @LiguresAmbrones Oh fascinating.
1302392454172217344 2020-09-06 07:45:33 +0800 <fairisleforest> @LiguresAmbrones That makes sense! In my case could also be my Swiss-German ancestry. I‚Äôm pretty sure Italian/S French usually pops up for us.
1302388465552642048 2020-09-06 07:29:42 +0800 <fairisleforest> @LiguresAmbrones I‚Äôm curious about this Med expression in UK/Irish people‚Äîshe is more beautiful than I but I have similar features to Erin O‚ÄôConnor &amp; I‚Äôm intrigued by what her genetics would be.  https://t.co/XzoVHCjQlM
1302386435329204224 2020-09-06 07:21:38 +0800 <fairisleforest> @LiguresAmbrones My hair has always been the same dark brown‚Äîlots of melanin but also must have a fair bit of pheomelanin bc it‚Äôs a very dark red in the sun. I love learning about genetic expression.
1302385972894556161 2020-09-06 07:19:47 +0800 <fairisleforest> @LiguresAmbrones My mom was white blond as a child, blond until she was a teenager &amp; became dark brunette as an adult. Dad always brown hair but skin fairer than me. I carry a gene for red hair my dad carries too, so does my boyfriend apparently. We both have cousins w/red hair.
1302385599542824960 2020-09-06 07:18:18 +0800 <fairisleforest> @LiguresAmbrones That would make sense. After one 23&amp;Me update my analysis went from 100% Euro to 99.9% ‚Äî that .1% (‚Äútrace‚Äù as they call it) is supposedly N. African/Middle Eastern. My parents‚Äô tests remained 100% Euro prediction.
1302360743015141376 2020-09-06 05:39:32 +0800 <fairisleforest> @LiguresAmbrones Anyway I‚Äôve always been curious about genetics because the pale/dark contrast of my coloring gets remarks. My boyfriend has the exact same coloring actually (pale/dark) &amp; also has tested 100% Euro. We have pretty similar phenotype...
1302360004234604544 2020-09-06 05:36:36 +0800 <fairisleforest> @LiguresAmbrones Interesting. I have very pale skin with many freckles that tans ever so slightly, mostly burns. I have very dark brown hair which sometimes looks black, lightens a bit in summer. I have hazel-brown eyes too. My parents &amp; I have all been said to be 100% Euro in genetic tests.  https://t.co/eELsKVhfrO
1301658766140518400 2020-09-04 07:10:08 +0800 <fairisleforest> I lean towards Cornwall, Scotland, or Ireland.
1301658584787214336 2020-09-04 07:09:24 +0800 <fairisleforest> I know this is a long shot, but while I love the region of the US I live in I am interested in returning to ancestral homelands‚ÄîScotland, Ireland, Cornwall, England, Germany. I plan to get a nursing degree to be a better candidate for immigration. Advice? Comments?

1301257357897261056 2020-09-03 04:35:04 +0800 <fairisleforest> @TheHearthFlame It is truly magical, it engages the children so deeply &amp; is profound for their developing brains. V good for them to get stories the way our ancestors did, without a screen‚Äîor even a page. It‚Äôs an antidote against overstimulation... their attention spans &amp; intelligence benefit.
1301256875686543361 2020-09-03 04:33:10 +0800 <fairisleforest> @TheHearthFlame Yes, it‚Äôs wonderful!
