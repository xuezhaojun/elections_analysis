1344012720203575296 2020-12-30 04:09:37 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Don't get it twisted. Trump was a front for Mitch McConnell like Mitch McConnell is a front for the Republicans who are a front for the wealthy who need fronts to pretend like they actually give a front of a fuck.
1343995416086540288 2020-12-30 03:00:52 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> You'd think they wake the fuck up but hating brown and gay people is too fun for the Stockholm syndrome sadists.
1343995406582210560 2020-12-30 03:00:49 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> McConnell was always the better fascist. Trump was just playing at it and served as a stupid lightning rod for their real policies of indifference. Trumpism is a fascist front of racist toddler fodder blowing themselves up for bigger bigot billionaires. Always has been.

1343719665986625540 2020-12-29 08:45:08 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Republicans do you love money or Georgia and control of the Senate more? DECIDE DIPSHITS. 🤣😂🤣  Sidenote: Temper tantrum Trump is the best Trump. Just keep his fascist ass away from the nukes.

1342864030801784834 2020-12-27 00:05:08 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @Inspector_W But enough to send a message. The bomber wanted the spectacle and destruction without loss of life...this time for all we know. Considerate terrorism is still terrorism.

1342855272885321730 2020-12-26 23:30:20 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I'm just upset because if the #NashvilleTerrorAttack had happened in Chicago the fascists would kicked in doors of every brown person's residence in half the city to force a "confession" out of a "suspect" about someone from the other half.
1342843974541836288 2020-12-26 22:45:27 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @djmjrules Fascism works via exhaustion. People have limited emotional  bandwidth when it comes to trauma. 6 dead babies are somehow more upsetting than 6 million jews...some of which were babies also. Get the death toll high enough and no lives matter as one.  Fascism is socialized death.
1342840332183080964 2020-12-26 22:30:58 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> So...we all just gonna pretend like we didn't have a domestic terrorist attack on Christmas Day?
1342681424873345024 2020-12-26 11:59:32 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> So an "intentional RV bomb" was detonated in Nashville and no one is calling it what it is? White privilege is when even a blatant terrorist attack gets preferential treatment.
1342678984258183169 2020-12-26 11:49:50 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> It's Christmas in 2020 so you know that means Trump is going to pardon Satan any minute now.

1342176656874733568 2020-12-25 02:33:46 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Real talk: You all realize that pardoning Blackwater murderers who operated in the Middle East killing civilians and children and sabre rattling about Iranian rockets is an attempt to trigger a Muslim backlash that would conveniently justify a holy war for his nutjob base, right?
1342168226646650884 2020-12-25 02:00:16 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Fascists only care about children when they're fucking them and even then they don't.
1342167410598694915 2020-12-25 01:57:01 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The #SaveTheChildren nutjobs are really quiet about the fascist child rapist-in-chief pardoning literal child killers.  One would almost think they were full of shit...  Nah. 'Mericuh. 🇺🇸
1342143008565833728 2020-12-25 00:20:03 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> At this rate Trump is more likely to pardon #COVID19 before #RealityWinner and that fact is sobering unadulterated bullshit.
1342113617832005634 2020-12-24 22:23:16 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @EFournierPhD Me and you both possibly but we're laughing today to keep that day at bay.
1342085672216260609 2020-12-24 20:32:13 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @EFournierPhD Do it while it's legal.
1341989343951519744 2020-12-24 14:09:27 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> America: Where being a black man selling a cigarette on the street is a death sentence but a racist fascist running a seditious Russian controlled death cabal is venerated as a political genius by half the country when he pardons convicted criminals from their deserved punishment
1341826186490638338 2020-12-24 03:21:07 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I'm not sure what's more hilarious, the fact that Trump is trying to pardon Kyle Rittenhouse at the federal level for state level crimes or the sobering realization that this isn't about Kyle Rittenhouse but emboldening more basement incel terrorists like him to follow his lead.
1341811054494543872 2020-12-24 02:20:59 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Quick, someone tell Trump that Obama wouldn't have the balls to demand 5K per family for COVID relief and NEVER would've challenged Mitch McConnell to eat his own shit with a generous side of whale dick during a Christmas Eve fireside chat.

1341427708123856901 2020-12-23 00:57:42 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Fuck rape! YEAH! Fuck sexism! YEAH! Fuck racism! YEAH! Fuck genocide! YEAH!

1341425705322749953 2020-12-23 00:49:45 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Why do people despise gallows humor while worshipping those running the gallows?
1341397060680085505 2020-12-22 22:55:55 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Pat Robertson's Trump support withdrawal should be the final nail in the inverted evangelical cross. When someone known for selling baseless shit declares you to be full of shit you might want to reevaluate your shit intake.

1339337692530831360 2020-12-17 06:32:44 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trump is doing his best to stop the virus that's a liberal hoax by making sure everyone is infected with it because it's China fault but don't forget by the way masks don't work so everyone wear one and socially distance unless it's Christmas because Jesus isn't an antifa commie.
1339245716527587334 2020-12-17 00:27:15 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> My pantheistic beliefs make me periodically fast out of the core tenet of empathy. Everything is an iteration of God. I go hungry not to please that deity but to understand how everything feels. The discomfort of that FEELING compels me to address it. Sometimes I forget to eat.
1339182406578950149 2020-12-16 20:15:41 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Job shaming in a pandemic where the people have literally been abandoned by their government is some myopic judgmental bullsh*t lacking both logic and empathy.

1338892248784773121 2020-12-16 01:02:42 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Our pleas for logic, civility, reason and facts fell on deaf ears as they strong armed themselves to the front of hate rallies and opened their mouths wide at the promise of showers of gold only to receive a golden shower when they rejected a scarlet letter for a urine yellow T.
1338889088875827208 2020-12-16 00:50:08 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I wonder what it's like to be unemployed and looking for work as a Trump supporter in a post-Trump world during a pandemic when people have seen them proudly regurgitate the most increasingly hateful shit over the past four years all over social media to friends and family. 😬
1338871458299260928 2020-12-15 23:40:05 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trump's silence after Putin openly acknowledges Trump's loss, Mitch McConnell congratulates Biden and Russia's revealed hacking shows that Trump was never truly in charge of the party-just his sucker base and Trump was always a pawn. He rages at everyone and everything but daddy.

1338517926597578753 2020-12-15 00:15:16 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> After the results are certified today by the same electoral college that the fascists didn't want to get rid of, who is putting money on Trump's books when he goes to jail?  Also...who's gonna tell him what a book is?
1338458925507686401 2020-12-14 20:20:49 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Today is the day the electoral college meets to certify the election thereby rendering any future attempts at sedition using legal mechanisms null and void. The fascists also love their 14-words so keep your head on a swivel as they implode. They only have violence as an option.

1337797881244299265 2020-12-13 00:34:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Did Trump seriously invite the leader of the bigot brownshit brigade for a secret war council after the supreme court shut his bullshit lawsuit down?  This is like a coup someone ordered from Wish.

1336505113293287428 2020-12-09 10:57:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @penofrage I agree. I don't think pacification is a passive role however. Religion is older than capitalism and exists in some form or another in every culture and is therefore a better vehicle for co-opting a culture as the programming pathways are already familiar and ingrained to exploit
1336499844287000580 2020-12-09 10:36:08 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Race was invented to justify capitalist western expansionism and forced subjugation of invaded cultures under the false assertion of divine right as part of collaboration with organized religion playing the role of pacifier but ya'll ain't ready to have that discussion yet.
1336488577233018881 2020-12-09 09:51:22 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Just did an awesome show about difficult discussions about race in the workplace. Enjoy. Apologize for technical difficulties...bear with me.

Aren't trying to overturn the results of "one of the most secure elections in history" with sedition 3. Haven't threatened killing public officials over states lost  That's the radical fascist right

1335843351279644673 2020-12-07 15:07:28 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> GOP senate incumbent Kelly Loeffler was technically correct when stating that she "doesn't have a racist bone in her body" because fascists like her are spineless pieces of shit held together by pure hate and ambition willing to fit the mold of any opportunity that grants power.
1335001931094372354 2020-12-05 07:23:58 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity There are two realities. One where you won and continued being a lying fascist and one where you lost. While you believe yourself to be in the former, you are actually in the latter yet defy physics by being a piece of shit in both timelines thus making you Schrodinger's Bitch.
1334941438895861760 2020-12-05 03:23:35 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The failure by Republicans to pass no-brainer cannabis legislation that could create millions of jobs and revenue as people scrape the bank account bottom of their shitty $1200 pandemic stimulus scraps proves that they actually love losing so much they mistake it for winning.
1334939594731757571 2020-12-05 03:16:16 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Not only did Republicans block any kind of stimulus package prior to Thanksgiving during this pandemic (where economic fallout is just beginning) but watch how fast they obstruct this landmark house cannabis jobs bill from seeing the light of day while Trump implodes their party.

You stomp them into oblivion using reason and logic and wear their carcass as a warning and example for others.  This is a war of ideology not a roundtable. I'm not giving them platforms. I'm MAKING platforms out of them.

1331068800691736577 2020-11-24 10:55:06 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> These Biden cabinet position announcements are nice and all but let's ask the important questions:  Who is being appointed to drag Trump kicking and screaming out of the Whitehouse?
1331020602686263298 2020-11-24 07:43:35 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @realDonaldTrump It's sad when people can't be sure about whether this is a thinly veiled threat, treasonous compliment or both because you're a piece of fascist fetid feces.
1331010152812736512 2020-11-24 07:02:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The problem with fascism is that you have a bunch of greed driven selfish shitty assholes so afraid of being perceived as being pussies that they end up becoming total dicks until everything is absolutely fucked.
1330959480566247427 2020-11-24 03:40:42 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> A fascist may benefit in the short term from distortion of the LETTER of these laws however the SPIRIT of the law (which resides in the people) will eventually demand restitution for the hunger caused by those who greedily consume the fruits of inequity...even those around them.
1330957642928418816 2020-11-24 03:33:24 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> There are certain rules we use and apply globally in order for society to function without collapse.  The spirit of our laws springs from these. You may be able to pervert, twist and even ignore the laws themselves but the spirit remains in the souls of the people.
1330956732990955520 2020-11-24 03:29:47 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I told you at the end of the Trump administration they would all eat each other alive for dominance. Fascism always ends this way.  No one can be King of Hatred forever.

1329836515363581955 2020-11-21 01:18:27 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I'm finding that talking about addressing systemic racial injustices ad nauseum (like the need for decriminalization of cannabis) is a great way to deflect from actually addressing systemic racial injustice like passing actual policies that address decriminalization of cannabis.
1329834343305519105 2020-11-21 01:09:49 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Why, you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence? What! beat his father if he opposes him?  Yes, he will, having first disarmed him.  Thus liberty, getting out of all order and reason, passes into the harshest and bitterest form of slavery.
1329834005013929990 2020-11-21 01:08:28 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> And therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant, who is high-minded, who is wise, who is wealthy; happy man, he is the enemy of them all, and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no, until he has made a purgation of the State.
1329833907747950594 2020-11-21 01:08:05 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> And the tyrant, if he means to rule, must get rid of them; he cannot stop while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything.  He cannot.
1329833795646787586 2020-11-21 01:07:38 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Then some of those who joined in setting him up, and who are in power, speak their minds to him and to one another, and the more courageous of them cast in his teeth what is being done.
1329833678789353473 2020-11-21 01:07:10 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> And if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom, and of resistance to his authority, he will have a good pretext for destroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy; and for all these reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war.  He must.
1329833511906381842 2020-11-21 01:06:31 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Has he not also another object, which is that they may be impoverished by payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him?  Clearly.
1329833270939443201 2020-11-21 01:05:33 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> But when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty, and there is nothing to fear from them, then he is always stirring up some war or other, in order that the people may require a leader.
1329833128060391427 2020-11-21 01:04:59 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> At first, in the early days of his power, he is full of smiles, and he salutes every one whom he meets;—he to be called a tyrant, who is making promises in public and also in private!
1329832789403979780 2020-11-21 01:03:38 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> And the protector of the people is like him; having a mob entirely at his disposal, he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen; by the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court and murders them,
1329832584067604480 2020-11-21 01:02:49 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse into greatness.  Yes, that is their way.  This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he first appears above ground he is a protector.
1329830363640848386 2020-11-21 00:54:00 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> she calls them to account and punishes them, and says that they are cursed oligarchs.
1329830362684542978 2020-11-21 00:54:00 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> When a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cup-bearers presiding over the feast, and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine of freedom, then, unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful draught,
1329829314179854340 2020-11-21 00:49:50 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> And then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their opponents, slaughtering some and banishing some, while to the remainder they give an equal share of freedom and power; and this is the form of government in which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot.
1329828818337615873 2020-11-21 00:47:51 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> There can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moderation cannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any considerable extent; one or the other will be disregarded.
1329828619213033474 2020-11-21 00:47:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The rulers, being aware that their power rests upon their wealth, refuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they gain by their ruin; they take interest from them and buy up their estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance... PLATO
1329606357994135554 2020-11-20 10:03:53 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Oh.  Look.  Fascists doing fascist shit.

1329545867657949191 2020-11-20 06:03:31 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Since Biden won people have become comfortable as hell for real. Apparently we have Trump and the office more credibility for our security than we're willing to admit, not to mention he's still the president until January.  Nothing has changed fundamentally.

1329317221651329025 2020-11-19 14:54:57 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trump paid 3 MILLION for a recount? For someone who likes "winning" so much, he really pays a premium for the Evian of losing experiences when over half the country already called him a loser for free.

1329102949738553346 2020-11-19 00:43:31 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @Juliewindels1 People with extremist views tend to make arguments that lead to absurd conclusions like this one here. The key to countering the normalization of said views is to conduct thought experiments using their own flawed logic and force them to own the results publicly.

1328998208790552576 2020-11-18 17:47:19 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Want to know how messed up our criminal justice system is?  It's so messed up we've created a cottage industry of making films and television shows about how messed up our criminal justice system is.
1328906452937961472 2020-11-18 11:42:42 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @ThsGrlKpsGoing Sorry not sorry.  Share this moment with me.
1328900495344365568 2020-11-18 11:19:02 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Is this the part of the movie where Lindsay Graham strips naked and runs down the streets screaming that he's gay and doesn't care who knows anymore and he's tired of Trump threatening to out him but everyone isn't shocked and just goes about their lives because we already knew?
1328868726830206978 2020-11-18 09:12:48 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @3kidpainter1 I got time.  It's a pandemic.  All we got is days.
1328854099828289536 2020-11-18 08:14:40 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Tuesday 7pm LIVE: North Carolina is a swing state battered by Climate Change, COVID19, struggling farm families, and communities fighting for literal survival. Tuesday's election brings hope for some, and fear for others. @ProgressIns05
1328717336774402048 2020-11-17 23:11:14 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @kimgasque @ericsslater @LindseyGrahamSC Supposedly? Lindsey should sue all the publications for slander yet he's strangely silent and simply denying the allegations without legal action. Trumps lies should've taught everyone that media doesn't make these claims without evidence to back them up for litigious protection.
1328539912128389121 2020-11-17 11:26:12 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @DwayneHinton Oh I get it! In that case...  Fuck 'em.
1328538672157888513 2020-11-17 11:21:17 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I don't understand what the big deal is:  DEFUND the police.  REFUND the community.  It's not hard to explain. People who don't WANT to get it WON'T no matter HOW you explain it.   That's how you know they're disingenuous obstructionists sabotaging discourse about real solutions.
1328487593781186572 2020-11-17 07:58:19 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @shanerobert20 It's all of them but capitalism encourages us to address none if it because the ailments are more profitable immediately than the remedies.
1328461473010638849 2020-11-17 06:14:31 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> It's telling however that America is given the option daily to reconcile with its racist past and instead subscribes to this existential distortion simply to avoid having the uncomfortable conversations that would provide meaningful change because it's easier to hate than heal.
1328461471689404416 2020-11-17 06:14:31 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Pretending like mental instability is a valid point of view not only undermines reality for society but gives false credence to delusion. No one should be surprised that the rationalizations occurring regularly now are becoming more and more fantastic and quite frankly absurd.
1328461465846689795 2020-11-17 06:14:29 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> UNPOPULAR OPINION: The main reason people won't admit Trump's mental health is unstable is due to the fact that his same cognitive afflictions exist in a large portion of the population. Treatment at that scale with our budget priorities is a logistical and financial nightmare.
1328449451694952451 2020-11-17 05:26:45 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @realDonaldTrump If you were really concerned about voting integrity you would've pressed Mitch McConnell to pass just ONE of the multiple election security bills on his desk. Instead your ass got clapped like a standing ovation in a strip club and you're about to be someone's bottom bunk bitch.
1328376728801120258 2020-11-17 00:37:46 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Abortion is murder.  A child should die in the womb of its isolated intubated mother at a hospital filled to capacity in the name of illogical fascist white supremacy the way the good Lord intended.
1328375137197023233 2020-11-17 00:31:27 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> You realize that by refusing to press for a concession, Republicans are complicit in the deaths of thousands from #COVID19 immediately incurred by Biden after January 20th due to Trump's refusal to facilitate a peaceful transition of power, right? They're pro-lifing us to death.
1328155051769155586 2020-11-16 09:56:54 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The very fact that he exists unscathed makes the presidency a mockery of democracy and simultaneously a monument to white supremacy with nothing novel about him but his mediocrity. The stain of fascism can only be washed clean from the office with the cleansing waters of justice.
1328077648833245190 2020-11-16 04:49:20 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> While you're conducting a genocide...  While you're accused of sexual assault... While you're accused of treason... While you're conducting mass homicide via gross negligence, sadism and incompetence...
1327991207654547456 2020-11-15 23:05:51 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @kikidulane Actually it was used with intent considering that the energy opposing this outgoing fascist administration was rooted in preventing more victims from being made. "Going back to normal" means those voices get put on a waiting list again. It's good to remember what we fight for.
1327990048701239297 2020-11-15 23:01:15 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> When lethal force is prioritized more than de-escalation this shit tends to happen. Unfortunately PETA takes precedent over people but I'm going to let that marinate internally as to why we feel more empathy about animals than we do some human beings.

1327608023095914496 2020-11-14 21:43:13 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Amen
1327401307309797376 2020-11-14 08:01:48 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trumpism proves that the toxic blight of American exceptionalism doesn't start at the blind loyalty to everything USA but is in fact rooted in our own individual egos with our moral compasses pointing continually to our own individual advantages, opportunities, and conveniences.
1327400012649783297 2020-11-14 07:56:39 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> An unacceptable number of women were fine with his sexism. An unacceptable number of parents were fine with child trafficking. An unacceptable number of minorities were fine with his racism. An unacceptable number of Americans were fine with treason.
1327399081585614848 2020-11-14 07:52:57 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> UNPOPULAR OPINION: Trump may have lost but election results prove that he increased his support despite his regular exhibitions of corruption, racism, misogyny, and xenophobia. America might think it's a new day with Biden but in reality Trump would've won if it wasn't for COVID.
1326787830459346944 2020-11-12 15:24:03 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Parler: Caps on. Facts off.
1326375909746683906 2020-11-11 12:07:14 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> They're not Republicans. They're fascists who have no love for democracy.
1326369942673960960 2020-11-11 11:43:31 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KimFinnie @RBReich Facts. He's quite the flight risk with all the knowledge that he has considering that he can buy his way into any non extradition country with his knowledge. People would be fools to underestimate what he'll do to save his own skin.
1326363028544221185 2020-11-11 11:16:03 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> This!  Democrats need to PLAY HARD BALL.

1326090236523372545 2020-11-10 17:12:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The fascists can't find the parents of 666 children that they lost in their genocide but they want to recount ballots...
1325891622870134784 2020-11-10 04:02:51 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Happy birthday @H4ppy_01
1325628453782253568 2020-11-09 10:37:07 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Forgive Trump supporters for their silence. It takes a while to scrub your entire social media history of four years of hateful bullshit.

1325128191556509698 2020-11-08 01:29:15 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> This taco bell administration needs a second flush for the senate in 2022. McConnell is about to do Biden like Obama otherwise.
1325114170212225030 2020-11-08 00:33:32 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @realDonaldTrump Do...you....do you think you're Joe Biden?
1325110444097490949 2020-11-08 00:18:43 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> 🤣😂🤣
1325099296958640128 2020-11-07 23:34:26 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I'd honestly be more worried if the Republicans were challenging the vote with him but they seem to be abandoning Trump now that they're election safe.
1325093454653890562 2020-11-07 23:11:13 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The fascists are protesting nationally at 12 to #StopTheSteal. Anyone else worried about a Reichstag Fire moment to impose martial law?
1324892608464900096 2020-11-07 09:53:07 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Now would be a PERFECT time for Melania to file for divorce.
1324880370718937089 2020-11-07 09:04:30 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Somebody needs to do a welfare check on these fascists standing back and standing by.  Someone didn't pay the white power bill.

1324783890679111683 2020-11-07 02:41:07 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @TheIrishJesus Hard to fight a ballot AND electoral college victory.
1324781863035150336 2020-11-07 02:33:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Who flips on the fat fascist fuck for immunity first?
1324776087910580224 2020-11-07 02:10:07 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @jennawadsworth And the unfortunate renewable resource of hate and bigotry.

1324751961795735552 2020-11-07 00:34:15 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I want to hug some of these fascists but I'm afraid they might shoot me for "attempting an aggressive embrace" or some other made up justification because they're losing their wrinkled orange Russian genocide pedophile puppet.
1324642580903137280 2020-11-06 17:19:36 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Why are all the little fascists quiet about the big fascist failing?   Y u no #MAGA2020?
1324418544499597313 2020-11-06 02:29:22 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> He's "rich" but you can't see his taxes... He's "smart" but you can't see his grades... He's "exonerated" but you can't read the report... He's "innocent" but you can't talk to witnesses...  He "won" but you can't count the votes?
1324413073197772800 2020-11-06 02:07:37 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> There's a lot of Trump apparel about to hit bargain bins at thrift stores just in time to be purchased by people about to lose their homes because of Republican policies enacted under Trump.

1324395547327868931 2020-11-06 00:57:59 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> 2016: I wish all these racists would go back in the closet they came from.  2020: Apparently half the country is from Narnia.
1324331949339627521 2020-11-05 20:45:16 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> With all these screams of fraud and tampering from Republicans regarding Trump's impending  defeat you'd think they would've invested more in security this election instead of paperweights on Mitch McConnell's desk.
1324066043560660992 2020-11-05 03:08:39 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @1980Dorothy Was she abusive growing up?

1324058477501796354 2020-11-05 02:38:35 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> How do you feel about...  Sex trafficking migrant children? Emboldening violent racists? Regulating women's bodies? Pussygrabbing? Tax fraud? 220,000 pandemic dead? Police brutality? Genocide?!  AMERICA: Let me think. 🤔
1324035663524671488 2020-11-05 01:07:56 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Shout out to every marginalized person out there just realizing today that half of the country doesn't care if you live or die. To be fair note that their actions show they don't care if THEY live or die either. However also take the time to realize that half of the country does.
1324030562957447169 2020-11-05 00:47:40 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> And this is yet ANOTHER reason why racism is a national security and public health risk...but you all don't want to have this conversation.  Makes people too uncomfortable. They'd rather die of COVID before engaging fascist white supremacy. Damn.
1324029098835017730 2020-11-05 00:41:51 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> ...ahem...  WE WOULD KNOW THE VOTE RIGHT NOW DECISIVELY AND DEFINITIVELY IF THE RACISM RACISTS CONSTANTLY DENY EXISTS TO HIDE THEIR RACISM WASN'T A PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY.  ...thank you...
1324027568765476865 2020-11-05 00:35:46 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @DueckRandall Sorry.  My point is that we should have.
1324022556068818952 2020-11-05 00:15:51 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Anyone else at work feeling like they're polishing brass on the Titanic today or is it just me? Maybe a better contemporary metaphor would be vacuuming the twin towers...of course they never saw it coming though...
1324018897058734081 2020-11-05 00:01:18 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @randomJoe217 Because cannabis usage correlates with a decline in the impulsive fear driven (and sometimes violent) consumption ideology capitalism requires to enrich its ruling class.
1324010654815178752 2020-11-04 23:28:33 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Cannabis could help fix all this shit but you don't want to hear me though.
1323935482326241280 2020-11-04 18:29:51 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @medik68 If half the country supports it and the other half doesn't our preexisting rule of law makes the final decision. Our laws demand that every vote be counted. It's a coup otherwise. This is a coup.
1323924034678128641 2020-11-04 17:44:21 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> It is very important that you call the Trump's premature declaration of victory and refusal to count all votes what it is whether it is successful or not.  We are in a #FascistCoup.   #FuckTheseFascists
1323917838000816129 2020-11-04 17:19:44 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The race might be too close to call but racism is winning all over the map for sure.
1323806769601257474 2020-11-04 09:58:23 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> This is the part of the future Oliver Stone movie where some big heist is going down behind the scenes while the whole country is fixated on CNN and Fox.
1323795974981144577 2020-11-04 09:15:30 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> These 2020 electoral maps prove that there are too many people fine with racism in this country for people to deny that racism exists.
1323736726985166848 2020-11-04 05:20:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Remember voting for Obama's second term and debating whether you should wear a bulletproof vest and gas mask because you were worried some crazy Barack supporter might shoot you from his pickup truck or the cops might use chemical irritants to deter you from voting? Me either.

1323683176171114497 2020-11-04 01:47:16 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Aren't we supposed to have the cure to #COVID19 today that Trump promised us?  Did I miss it?  Are they handing it out at polling locations?   Maybe he's saying voting him out is the cure?  Weird flex but ok...#VOTE
1323638113009311745 2020-11-03 22:48:12 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Get your mind right for the next chapter. The required conviction needed for tomorrow demands that you be committed today. #VOTE

1323485536556908544 2020-11-03 12:41:55 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @Nipplefat2 @benFranklin2018 Same. Since 2016 and I was called hyperbolic.
1323447863314128896 2020-11-03 10:12:13 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> If Trump wins legitimately tomorrow America needs to start an OnlyFans because we are most certainly fucked and should be duly compensated.
1323380102026190849 2020-11-03 05:42:58 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The fascists are right.  The world doesn't owe anyone anything. It's because of that truth we fight to make it more fair and equitable so each of us can have the resources to give the best of ourselves to society. The world doesn't owe us anything.  WE OWE EACH OTHER EVERYTHING.
1323310118440706054 2020-11-03 01:04:52 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> So he knows he's going to lose and this is the plan.

1323280644710014977 2020-11-02 23:07:45 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The sad thing is that today feels like the last day of normalcy... Until you realize the hilarious fact that nothing is normal right now... Was anything ever really normal? Will there come a day in the far future where we will long for the chaos of tomorrow?
1323258254454104066 2020-11-02 21:38:47 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Regardless of what happens tomorrow, climate change isn't going anywhere and global instability will continue to unfold. We need leaders like @jennawadsworth leading the way to address food scarcity and help open new revenue markets via cannabis legalization.  VOTE for your life!
1323165205598216193 2020-11-02 15:29:02 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Truth
1322942762120085507 2020-11-02 00:45:08 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> It's time to lean into your weirdness. Fascism loves uniformity. It creates predictable markets for manipulation and control.  If everyone is the same, uneducated, and uninformed they can't be united against authoritarianism. The greatest weapon against fascism is the unique you.
1322540509324337156 2020-10-31 22:06:43 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I just woke and I'm still mad.  I want someone to beat Lil Wayne in a Versuz battle for supporting Trump...  ...literally.
1322236944261255175 2020-10-31 02:00:28 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Can @LilTunechi even vote?
1322235180413837312 2020-10-31 01:53:27 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> How about we do #VERZUZ battles featuring Trump supporters against actual Americans?  Then people can be spared more garbage surprise revelations like Lil Wayne and 50 Cent.
1322209996592041984 2020-10-31 00:13:23 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @SteeOne But voting without a ground force to communicate that to the public is where the problem is.
1322209748209541130 2020-10-31 00:12:24 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @OhaleMoses We do. Now is not the time and this is not the way.
1322188024793485312 2020-10-30 22:46:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @SteeOne So you started in 2016 after Trump was elected? Or wait, you used that momentum in 2018 to get Green candidates in office locally?  Greens have a lot of ideals and ideas they're voting for but they all lack one thing: A unified plan about how to attain any of their goals.
1322174655277522945 2020-10-30 21:52:57 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Want to see if a Green party voter is full of shit?  Ask them what they're going to do to grow their party for 2022.   Bonus points if they call tell you what they did in 2018.
1321543339808837640 2020-10-29 04:04:19 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I don't care if I see a tweet taking off, I'll delete that shit if I see a typo. Proper grammar separates the humans from the fascists these days.  Theirs always a way they're making there devotion to ignorance known.  ☝🏿That last sentence hurt SO much to write.
1321541201040912386 2020-10-29 03:55:50 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> So the Democrats are saying they fought the Barrett nomination "fiercely" and the Republicans are claiming that we beat COVID19 and the pandemic is over.   The cannabis in DC must be some Grade-A shit because everyone is obviously high as hell.
1321537538255917056 2020-10-29 03:41:16 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> My show from last night. Check it out.
1321474754658869248 2020-10-28 23:31:47 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @Forsureafedera1 That's what makes the mental gymnastics so marvelous.  None of this shit is new yet people are repeating history and pretending to be shocked at the outcomes.
1321471946895351809 2020-10-28 23:20:38 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> When historians look back on this moment they won't marvel as much at the corrupt depths of depravity Trump was willing to go to out of his own selfish interests as they will at the gold medal olympic level mental gymnastics those he hurt were willing to perform to follow him.
1321240466596237312 2020-10-28 08:00:49 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Using You Against You: Bigots, bait and binary thinking....
1321216358596694018 2020-10-28 06:25:01 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Tell me how you lost your loved ones to the cult of MAGA.  What was your breaking point? When did you say you were done? And...if not...why? What's your point of no return when it comes to the violence, death, lies and corruption of fascist authoritarianism? 👌🏿🙃👌🏿
1321215264587980802 2020-10-28 06:20:40 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @ThatMTLGirl Sorry for your loss.  Cults work like that.
1321214196508467200 2020-10-28 06:16:26 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Speak on it. #FuckTheseFascists
1321205736853164037 2020-10-28 05:42:49 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Preach. Call them out.
1321198677654970370 2020-10-28 05:14:46 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Seriously though, some of you do have people that you're close to and you know they're a few racists short of a lynch mob in the head. Do you know what they've been up to? Do they come home smelling like gunpowder and burned crosses? If you see something you should say something.
1321194168190967808 2020-10-28 04:56:50 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> If you have fascists in your close circle of family and friends who've visibly stockpiled weapons and declared and/or demonstrated cult-like loyalty to Trump, talking to someone about it might be a good idea.

1321123575059853313 2020-10-28 00:16:20 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @ReitterSonja You're probably more of a Devin Nunes kind of woman...  That's when you wait for someone to order a drink then down it in front of them while you bang their wife.
1321093329430421505 2020-10-27 22:16:09 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Spread it.
1321069417556512769 2020-10-27 20:41:08 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> You ever order a Susan Collins at the bar? It's easy. Just order a Tom Collins and right when you raise your glass to drink it, have the bartender slap it out of your hands and piss in your mouth.  Chase it with a lemon slice.
1320940721763979264 2020-10-27 12:09:44 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @wvfilmmaker That's blatant projection from those who voted for a candidate that polled horribly in a populist election and chose to ignore flyover states completely due to her own arrogance.  Wonder to this day why she lost to the worst leader in America's history? Guess we'll never know.
1320933770942361601 2020-10-27 11:42:07 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Let us not reason like cowards...[I]f a man comes into my hut and defecates on the floor, what do I do? Do I shut my eyes? No!

1320916203976695808 2020-10-27 10:32:19 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Of course they did. I told you so.  Ya'll ready to listen now? #FuckTheseFascists
1320905275604426752 2020-10-27 09:48:53 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @bowiestardust2 @existentialcoms Are the streets filled with rebellion at this fascist power grab? You know sue was appointed to steal the election right? That's literally why they did it before/during the election.
1320725675813310465 2020-10-26 21:55:13 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Fucking fascist psychopaths.
1320704322779467779 2020-10-26 20:30:22 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> After a late night run through Tinder for pure amusement it's become readily apparent (and confirmed from multiple profile pics) that too many women are obviously fucking the same dolphin.
1320579052755947520 2020-10-26 12:12:36 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KeeperofHope923 Thanks family.
1320563899368951808 2020-10-26 11:12:23 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Who knew you had to be so pro-death to be pro-life?
1320563616597291014 2020-10-26 11:11:15 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> So that's the Republican COVID plan? Die? No War Powers Act to prepare hospitals for an influx of patients as we go into FLU season, no national mask mandates, no coordination of quarantines, no more federal assistance and they expect us to believe they have a HEALTHCARE plan? 🤣
1320554595249246209 2020-10-26 10:35:24 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> HERD IMMUNITY PROTIP: When COVID is allowed to run rampant (as the rest of the developed world addresses it with science and leadership) only the wealthy will be able to buy their way out of an increasingly quarantined and constantly infected America. #Covid19 is the wall.

1320505459791593472 2020-10-26 07:20:10 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> People that leave you on read in a pandemic are a special kind of satan.

1320106820262875136 2020-10-25 04:56:07 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @kirsteneken @RichardAiken161 For me respect is granted for all humans among us by default and lost based on actions but can be regained. This allows for respect of children by default. The amount of tolerance for lack of respect declines with age however.
1320018414342197249 2020-10-24 23:04:49 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Exactly. #FuckTheseFascists
1320007233095274496 2020-10-24 22:20:23 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Ask yourself, "How has a fascist earned my respect today?"
1320006883902738432 2020-10-24 22:19:00 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> And this concept of excusing behavior because an elder is "from a different time" is some questionable bullshit too. In a "different time" I had a flat top, wore hammer pants and drank 4Loko. I. Stopped. That's why I have a functional liver.
1320004975993475072 2020-10-24 22:11:25 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Any "elder" supporting his bullshit can grab a plate too. If you can't respect the government's obligation to protect our very right to live by informing us of danger and using all powers to assist us as citizens instead of lying and endangering our families there IS NO respect.
1320002929202499586 2020-10-24 22:03:17 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> One of the greatest lies Trump has ever exposed is the concept of respecting your elders simply because they're old. Trump is definitely my senior and I'll gladly tell anyone he can eat an endangered whale carcass ass first in a literal shitstorm for his #COVID19 response alone.
1319950728883044352 2020-10-24 18:35:51 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Bingo.
1319801880147537920 2020-10-24 08:44:23 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> TRUMP: I'm the least racist person ever.  ANY FUCKING JOURNALIST PLEASE: Then WHY do racists endorse you and do what you tell them to?
1319761607291998209 2020-10-24 06:04:21 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> "Look someone left out a double sided dildo covered in razor blades and peanut butter!  What crazy person put this out here?!  Welp, guess I better use it on anybody and everybody!"  This is how fascists sound to me when they talk about #WhoBuiltTheCages and concentration camps.
1319746113428201473 2020-10-24 05:02:47 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I love my friends and followers. I dont have bots behind me. I have people actually doing BUSINESS! @3kidpainter1 👌🏿❤👌🏿  https://t.co/0L4EBNJUj3
1319745499646361601 2020-10-24 05:00:21 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Best compliment came from my son's fiancee today! She said my son is smart, emotionally accessible, not homophobic and respects women. That's part of why she loves him in spite of their differences and his stubborness. She said his mother and I raised him well.  That's my Marine!
1319567798524432384 2020-10-23 17:14:14 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> *Saint
1319471797499297792 2020-10-23 10:52:45 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> They're taking good care of these children... - Trump  That we stole from their parents.
1319466550978613252 2020-10-23 10:31:54 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> This just in: Wind is expensive.

1319462351117189128 2020-10-23 10:15:13 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I've done more for black colleges... - Trump   An HBCU president at Saunt Augustine's University just died...from COVID. @SAU_News
1319461535287226370 2020-10-23 10:11:59 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> And now two old white men will talk about solving violent systemic racism.   Nothing could go wrong.
1319453573416091648 2020-10-23 09:40:20 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Ivanka? Jared? Don Jr? Why are we not talking about Trump's snake oil spawn?!  It's such low hanging fruit! What the fuck?!
1319452759436001280 2020-10-23 09:37:06 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Ugh Bidengate. I hate giving this bullshit life with this dialogue.
1319451771400540162 2020-10-23 09:33:11 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I'm under audit.  Forever?
1319449760043061248 2020-10-23 09:25:11 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> We need to reopen schools and not be afraid of COVID! - says the fascist with his son quarantined from school because he's afraid of COVID
1319449084726513665 2020-10-23 09:22:30 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trump should've employed the war powers act and gotten ahead of this shit from the start but he wants us to walk into the gas chamber because of his incompetence.
1319448068094414848 2020-10-23 09:18:28 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trump has switched over to some kind of remedial sign language in lieu of verbal responses.
1319447208928944128 2020-10-23 09:15:03 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> #BunkerBitch just claimed he doesn't hide in basements.
1319446741679296512 2020-10-23 09:13:12 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Joe Biden didn't move quicker on his COVID reaponse? What in the fuck was Joe Biden supposed to do?!
1319446229676400641 2020-10-23 09:11:09 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Did Trump just manipulate the stock market in real time?
1319445737290203136 2020-10-23 09:09:12 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> That's right.  Talk THROUGH him Joe. #FuckTheseFascists
1319445273152753666 2020-10-23 09:07:21 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> It's a worldwide pandemic.*  - Donald Trump  Yes dumbass. That's what PANdemic means.

1319421243993526272 2020-10-23 07:31:52 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Q: Why'd the chicken cross the road?  A: So Rudy Guiliani wouldn't choke it
1319391938253066241 2020-10-23 05:35:25 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Moderators went with a small crowd debate format not because of COVID but because when they suggested a 'mass debate'  Rudy Guiliani demanded bedside seats on the front row.
1319352808727105537 2020-10-23 02:59:56 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Obama should make a surprise appearance and sit in the audience tonight during the debate to laugh intermittently whenever Trump responds to Biden so we can watch Trump crap a fascist brick of petulant racist rage right before the moderators cut his microphone.
1319313838316150784 2020-10-23 00:25:05 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> AOC plays Among Us online and NOW people want to respect video games as political forums for discussion. Inner teenage me is highly pissed right now for not getting more support.
1319300155003338752 2020-10-22 23:30:43 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @johncardillo Affection is foreign to fascists. Most of their families hate them. The only physical contact they understand as far as intimacy is concerned involves some element of sadism.
1319268323406786560 2020-10-22 21:24:13 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> As long as Trump and other enablers keep child rapists in power? Congrats. We're ALL rapists funding rapists who like to rape because no one is stopping them from raping those they rape and the raped never get justice which normalizes rape. That's a lot of rape. Fascists love it.
1319266666287685639 2020-10-22 21:17:38 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Did you know that Trump's ICE concentration camps are not only places where taxpayer dollars fund genocide but children have and are actively been molested by ICE agents and others? The biggest child sex trafficking ring in America is literally America. Have a nice day.
1319256409700184065 2020-10-22 20:36:53 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Hey, did you hear that Guiliani found that Hunter Biden wasn't one of the 220,000 Americans dead from a nonexistent COVID response while being nowhere near the cops who aren't being charged for killing Breonna Taylor or any of the migrant children abducted in concentration camps?
1319078144989691909 2020-10-22 08:48:31 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @thamonkey1975 Like a canary. Anything to save himself from jail time but I have a feeling Russia has some kompromat that will keep him from hitting all the notes. Plus they're the mob so I'm sure his family is fair game if he runs his mouth too much.  Putin has no problem killing threats.

1319058225375961089 2020-10-22 07:29:22 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Obama is crushing Trump on CNN as he hits the campaign trail in the final stretch, Rudy is caught with his pants down, Bidengate is crashing, and the moderators are silencing microphones. Trump is gonna shit himself tomorrow on live TV.  He might even mess up and drop the n-bomb.

1318949231386857478 2020-10-22 00:16:16 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The outcry by fascists over my ridicule of Rush "Soon To Be Dead From Lung Cancer" Limbaugh illustrates a very notable point I want you to focus on as 220,000 are dead in a pandemic:  They understand the concept of empathy. They just don't apply it to anyone who isn't a fascist.
1318941381684056064 2020-10-21 23:45:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> FASCISTS: If only there was something we could do to help black people... @Blklivesmatter: Stop killing us. @Kaepernick7: Let us protest. @RevDrBarber: Help poor people. @shaunking: Reform the system.

You did it to yourselves with yo angry asses. Elect a pussygrabber who kills 220,000 friends and family and people tend not to like you.  Blame. You.
1318898462600159232 2020-10-21 20:54:32 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I think my biggest issue with @icecube and his approach to deep systemic inequality is that while he is willing to pass around a collections plate at Ku Klux Kovid rallies @RevDrBarber has been doing this work for years while building a multicultural coalition like MLK was doing.
1318893124320710656 2020-10-21 20:33:19 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> FASCISTS: StOP BeInG MEan to trump! He'S FIGHting CoviD!  ALSO FASCISTS: stOP BEiNG MEan tO rUsH LImbaugh! he haS LuNG CANcEr!  ME:  Fuck Donald Trump with Rush Limbaugh's rolled up obituary.
1318787686468145153 2020-10-21 13:34:21 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Watch Trump show up at the final debate with a bullhorn to counteract his microphone being turned off and Republicans defending the move by claiming that there technically are no rules against bullhorns thereby forcing the Democrats to do absolutely postively nothing in response.
1318747872372969474 2020-10-21 10:56:08 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> First he was dragged in his own town hall and now he's running from interviews. Trump seems to have a serious problem with addressing assertive women that ask actual questions and press for answers. They must be like Pussygrabber Kryptonite.
1318687965443510273 2020-10-21 06:58:05 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> What 'White' People Should Do Now...
1318687099311316992 2020-10-21 06:54:39 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> ...Which sucks if you're a fascist because there's simply a lifetime of anger and violence and fear to reflect upon. Then again, fascists are into that shit so I guess it still applies?
1318683800184946689 2020-10-21 06:41:32 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> When death comes, may the life that flashes before your eyes be well-lived and give you peace and joy in reflection of all the good you brought into the world. Amen.
1318681548531601413 2020-10-21 06:32:35 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> They suddenly went from lynching to giving the enemy they've raped, killed and tortured for generations raises?  They hate their OWN people! #COVID19 is killing PEOPLE FROM ALL RACES. 👏🏿 Fucking. 👏🏿 THINK! 👌🏿🙃👌🏿
1318681547701092352 2020-10-21 06:32:35 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> How do a bunch of confirmed racists benefit from making Black people rich?
1318681542848401412 2020-10-21 06:32:34 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Honey what was you thinkin?* *Black momma voice   Ya'll need some primers on fascists. You're fucking with unapologetic LIARS.
1318674433893163008 2020-10-21 06:04:19 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> You'd think someone supposedly from the streets would know a hustle when they see one. Fraternizing with fascists inevitably end up in failure.
1318672991128113155 2020-10-21 05:58:35 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Frankly I don't feel any remorse for the blowback Ice Cube is getting. He literally made a song called Arrest The President for being "Russian Intelligence" then turns around to seek aid for "Blacks" and is somehow surprised that he's being used as a token without any guarantees?
1318570178192527361 2020-10-20 23:10:02 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Steve Troxler is pushing 70 and has been in office for 15 years thanks to big agriculture donations. That's why the future of NC farming isn't a priority 4 him despite the devastation of climate change. He won't be around to see it. #KickRocksTrox, it's time for @jennawadsworth.
1318374430716891143 2020-10-20 10:12:13 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Now watch them turn around and vote to name the place Trump High just to be *ironic.  * Totally absolutely positively racist
1318372798583218176 2020-10-20 10:05:44 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I don't know what's funnier, the fact that the racist racism deniers in the Seaman district (that's deep in Trump supporter territory btw) have to admit that they were founded by the terrorist Ku Klux Klan or the fact that they have to acknowledge that Fred Seaman was a Democrat.
1318369261727977472 2020-10-20 09:51:40 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Since it's been revealed that my alma mater Seaman High School was founded by the KKK, they should change their name to The School For The Totally Not Racist Students Against Racism Who Want To Be Anti-Racist. Go LIBERALS!
1318355736288780288 2020-10-20 08:57:56 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Anyone who hasn't caught COVID19 yet should head to the super spreader event being held at the NC State Fairgrounds! Step right up for some piping hot deep fried death!  ...Or vote @jennawadsworth to end this madness and #TellTrox2KickRocks. #ncpol
1318225194553663492 2020-10-20 00:19:12 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The opposite of love isn't hate but indifference.
1318224853049221121 2020-10-20 00:17:51 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> It's a common misconception that the endgame of fascism is hate when in all actuality fascists ultimately don't want you to care at all. Hate is just the gateway drug. Apathy is the final destination.
1317884328400084993 2020-10-19 01:44:43 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @RadioKingKyle And how fucked up it has always been. A lot of people were too privileged to notice it because they weren't directly affected by race, class, gender, sexuality, religion etc.  Fascism combined with climate change brings all the stressors of tribalism to the surface with scarcity.
1317855946471768065 2020-10-18 23:51:56 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @kittymama1994 Oh totally. Misogyny is inherently baked into racism and perpetuates the construct. Women are simply viewed as wombs without independent thought to make more troops for their appointed team.
1317847587513315330 2020-10-18 23:18:43 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Calling yourself a "constitutional originalist" is a really weird way to let people know you're a classically trained racist.
1317833516550336513 2020-10-18 22:22:49 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I agree with the fascists. Hunter Biden is terrifying.  That's why I voted for his dad.  Only he can save us from this menace he created.
1317545036276326400 2020-10-18 03:16:30 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @SwiftRead @NC_Governor @RoyCooperNC Cool story bro.   Quick question:  Are we still there or no?
1317513016401866752 2020-10-18 01:09:15 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> This could help monitor any fuckery afoot if you encounter it this year at the polls. See something, say something.

ALSO FASCISTS: It came from China and Obama did worse but ate all the dead bodies with the Democrats in a satanic pizza party basement fetus ritual run by Hunter Biden. Trust the plan. #KAGAMAGA
1317450883869908993 2020-10-17 21:02:22 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @SwiftRead @NC_Governor @RoyCooperNC Again. Engagements aren't wars. We're still there. Servicemen are still dying. Try again.
1317423960221491202 2020-10-17 19:15:23 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @SwiftRead @NC_Governor @RoyCooperNC Nothing to do with the budget STILL being inflated and us involved in shadow disputes on every continent besides Antarctica making your claim about Trump ending foreign wars specious at best.  There is no evidence of that claim beyond propaganda. He ended engagements. Try again.
1317287510721110019 2020-10-17 10:13:11 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I was today years old when it was finally revealed that my high school was founded by a goddamn klan member. This explains SO much.   https://t.co/R9zcPsRi9i
1317262561084133376 2020-10-17 08:34:02 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @SwiftRead @NC_Governor @RoyCooperNC Oh. So you're for defunding the military then? 🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣
1317262372415954944 2020-10-17 08:33:17 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @SwiftRead @NC_Governor @RoyCooperNC Lol. Fascism has and always will be from the right, fascist. Read a dictionary. "Historically used to describe the experiences of fascism and Nazism today far-right politics includes neo-fascism, neo-Nazism, the Third Position, the alt-right, white supremacism, white nationalism"
1317076427536277507 2020-10-16 20:14:25 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @TheDailyShow "Moderates": Same. I have no idea who is worse here.
1317074484503941121 2020-10-16 20:06:41 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> It would be such a shame if #SleepyDonald woke up to this. I hope he got a good night's rest after being owned like a Russian callgirl in his own town hall. He was SO low energy. On the other hand @JoeBiden kept going after his #TownHall and even hung out to take questions after.
1317070048234774533 2020-10-16 19:49:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Good morning. The Russian installed fascist authoritarian with violent white supremacists on standby who is 420 million dollars in debt to undisclosed foreign creditors in the middle of a pandemic is now employing tax payer funded death squads.  It's a great Friday to #VoteEarly
1317066077931712512 2020-10-16 19:33:17 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @SwiftRead @NC_Governor @RoyCooperNC Fascism is an ideology not a genetic birthright. You embrace an authoritarian party that has lied to the American public to the tune of 218 THOUSAND dead Americans and during a spike in cases you endorse a disproven herd immunity approach that functionally equates to genocide. 🖕🏿
1317047724701868032 2020-10-16 18:20:21 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @SwiftRead @NC_Governor "Thousands of doctors"  I love when fascists toss out random numbers and figures with no evidence especially after their autocrat in chief catches COVID after supposedly taking it and lying.  "Many people are saying..." you're an idiot. Vote @RoyCooperNC and stop these morons.
1317039476384911360 2020-10-16 17:47:35 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @SwiftRead Oh the same guy who promoted the hydrochloroquine scam Trump was selling and didn't take when he supposedly contracted COVID?  Post the witch doctor next. Or maybe don't be more of an idiot and vote @NC_Governor and stop the madness.  https://t.co/lyX7AU3YTt
1316851527890472962 2020-10-16 05:20:44 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Those who embrace apathy acknowledge change is for the better is possible in their behavior.  Why seek to destroy what was not created? They assume existence is absolute and finite to rationalize their endless greed and undermine hope. The anger of the empathetic is righteous.
1316808520092835840 2020-10-16 02:29:50 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @SwiftRead Governors and teachers respond to the science of epidemiology to keep us safe. You craft policy in pandemics (while cases are spiking about a disease scientists still don't totally understand) using  *checks notes*  ...pediatricians. I'm glad the only thing you run is your mouth.
1316787635747258371 2020-10-16 01:06:51 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @SwiftRead Again...are pediatric physicians the same as epidemiologists or is literacy a problem for you?
1316785501622472707 2020-10-16 00:58:22 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @SwiftRead Because the pediatric association of composed of epidemiologists now? When your house is on fire do you call a plumber too?

1316444494301138944 2020-10-15 02:23:20 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Once you accept that racism is simply fascist authoritarian law applied to a subjugated population using genetic characteristics as a qualifier you can accept that fascism is as American as apple pie.
1316416436626219009 2020-10-15 00:31:50 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Watching fascists fail repeatedly at prosecuting Hillary or Obama would be comical except the body count from actual criminality perpetually undermines the laugh track.

1316411916944842752 2020-10-15 00:13:53 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> And then come the lies. Constructed gods forced upon you justify your suffering. Distorted science minimizes your pain. Altered history undermines the culmination of your very existence. Your life becomes spectacle. Your suffering becomes art. Your pain becomes a price point.
1316411915900465159 2020-10-15 00:13:53 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> You are  fed fear  daily  and  expected to drink  sadness and anger.
1316411914633670657 2020-10-15 00:13:52 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Yet you're supposed to smile and pretend this is normal. Raise children to suppress reaction and emotion and somehow negate the high chemical levels of cortisol perpetually flooding their bloodstreams due to persistent anxiety that contributes to physical alteration of the mind.
1316411911920062464 2020-10-15 00:13:52 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> And what makes it worse is that you're not supposed to talk about it lest you make people uncomfortable. Your very existence is politicized. Your life mattering is a dog whistle to racists and a football for opportunists. Comment on this literal truth is considered controversial.
1316397196053540869 2020-10-14 23:15:23 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Brandon why are you so political?  1.

Using the criminal justice department to fight personal rape cases? Fascist. Funneling government funds through your private corporations? Fascist. Disrupting voting by mail in Democrat states while encouraging in Repubs? Fascist.
1315309244527370242 2020-10-11 23:12:15 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @ross_oak @CalforNC @ThomTillis I noticed you responded to one accusation while ignoring all the others. Fascinating fascist deflection tactic...and that case was reopened with pending evidence with all the others. Why won't Trump give his DNA to exonerate himself? Who hides exculpatory evidence in a rape case?
1315281530923757573 2020-10-11 21:22:08 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KCA207 @ProudSocialist @JoeBiden Agreed.

Neither did the 20+ other victims and the children in the pageants he admittedly walked in on without announcing. Your :controlled" emotional ardent defense of pedophilia and rape is noted however.

This is simply bullshit righteous indignation from someone who supports an individual who brags about grabbing women by their genitals. Sometimes I forget fascists are so stupid they think everyone forgets history like they do for immediate gain.
1315033903258886144 2020-10-11 04:58:09 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Good old fashioned polite midwestern fascism.
1315025398544117761 2020-10-11 04:24:21 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Exactly fucking this.  Fascists LOVE to steal the present while they use fear and speculation about what their enemies might do in the future to excuse and rationalize their immediate death and deceit.

Fascists really need to get better at obscuring their blatantly transparent ad hominem attacks and talking points while failing to clarify positions. It's a HUGE tell.  Do you all go to the same school for this shit or just the same Gab?
1314928836635746305 2020-10-10 22:00:39 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @ross_oak @CalforNC @ThomTillis No claim is necessary. It's defacto.  Intelligence and fascism are counterintuitive.  That's why fascists have to lie to seize power and fail and keeping it even when they manage attain it. The concept in principle is quite the laughable oxymoron.   Fascism always eats itself.
1314927420470943745 2020-10-10 21:55:01 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @MrWizzer @RoyTFord This is quite true. Check their hair also. Sometimes they shave their heads, get a tat and then it grows back over.
1314904777202032641 2020-10-10 20:25:03 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Listen to this fascist piece of shit play coy about sharing a stage with the kidnapping terrorists by claiming they may have been conducting a "legal citizen's arrest" BUT conveniently leaving out the extrajudicial trial and execution part that definitely isn't legal whatsoever.

1314896257484304391 2020-10-10 19:51:12 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Get you someone whose eyes light up like fascists' do when they hear about Hillary's emails in 2020.  Just be careful because they're probably fucking crazy...and stupid. They're definitely stupid.

When Hitler seized power he privatized everything just like Trump has been attempting to do by appointing capitalists to dismantle public services like the post office and education.

1314642067302363138 2020-10-10 03:01:08 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> This is @SteveTroxlerNC. This is fascism.

1314626021828812801 2020-10-10 01:57:22 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @osnapstephanie @mattdizwhitlock @CalforNC Good god these fascists are desperate...  https://t.co/4GP0qvhxnw
1314601918702985217 2020-10-10 00:21:36 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Unless @CalforNC molested a child or an animal I don't give a shit. This is between him, the Army and his family. He might be flawed but he's not as bad as the genocidal outbreak orange in the White House @ThomTillis fellates with zeal. #ncpol @NC_Progressives  https://t.co/J4HenfnQ8n
1314577023159996416 2020-10-09 22:42:40 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> This is the kind of fake propaganda fascists have been up to while actual white supremacist terrorists plot to kill democratically elected officials that don't bend to their bullshit...
1314534152029560837 2020-10-09 19:52:19 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @3kidpainter1 Literally.
1314534046882463744 2020-10-09 19:51:54 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I noticed the garish red and yellow color palette for Steve Troxler's campaign not only reminds me of Ronald McDonald but makes his ads look terrible and illegible. Then again if you're backed by racist Confederates and big ag donors you're probably a clown. Vote @jennawadsworth.
1314340593557008385 2020-10-09 07:03:11 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @x25_princess I think. Problem with these authoritarians is that they need these tightly packed small venues to appear as of they have more support than they do. That's what makes them super spreader events: Their own vanity.
1314335395602145292 2020-10-09 06:42:32 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Bioterrorism.  Kidnapping.  Voter intimidation.  Welcome to the open visible violence phase of American fascism.
1314334246820098048 2020-10-09 06:37:58 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @RoyAllenHunt Exactly. There were THRITEEN people arrested and they had an informant for MONTHS but Barr didn't know? Please.
1314323511247339523 2020-10-09 05:55:18 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Proud Boys like Parscale don't take a vow of celibacy...celibacy automatically comes with the world view because no one with a functioning soul and clear conscience will fuck a fascist once they find out what they stand for.
1314311281483153410 2020-10-09 05:06:42 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> This fascist piece of shit was so busy looking for fake antifa terrorist cells he totally missed the Trump supporting racists under his own Hitler fanboy mustache.
1314280204123209728 2020-10-09 03:03:13 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> This is that Day of the Rope shit.  #AmericanTerrorists #LIBERATEMICHIGAN
1314263220178292736 2020-10-09 01:55:44 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trump supporters formed a cell to kidnap and kill a politician but yeah...totally not terrorists.
1314253116783693825 2020-10-09 01:15:35 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Fascists making lists isn't new. Some of us have been dealing with being on them for the past few years. Imagine all the lists outside of #LiberateMichigan that you're not seeing. ...The lists of fascist lone gunmen.  ...The lists of racist militias standing back and standing by.
1314251836426199044 2020-10-09 01:10:30 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> #LiberateMichigan
1314244942945021953 2020-10-09 00:43:06 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Hey did you hear that crazy story about antifa abducting a duly elected public official with the intent to conduct an extrajudicial treason hearing and murder them?  No?  Oh well. Here's one about some Trump supporters who did that instead until you can find it.
1314227043102531584 2020-10-08 23:31:58 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @MalcolmNance @Mgauzeo Wrong. This is an advertisement for fascism.
1314178390208000000 2020-10-08 20:18:39 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The fly couldn't help himself.  Kamala left Pence in a fecal position.
1314170197343965184 2020-10-08 19:46:05 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Mansplaining 101 in full effect last night.
1314163027793633280 2020-10-08 19:17:36 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Prayers to any man who interrupts a woman today that watched the debates last night.
1314052781976612864 2020-10-08 11:59:31 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @RadioKingKyle MVP  https://t.co/ojmcqylZZ2
1314050305684836353 2020-10-08 11:49:41 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Does the fly have an agent?  I want a whole Netflix series of the last days in the White House from his perspective.  https://t.co/CM5sLUEXBc
1314043387339829251 2020-10-08 11:22:11 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Black men have been slaughtered since slavery for expressing their anger.  Black women were simply silenced for expressing theirs because they didn't want to destroy good breeding stock.
1314043379278323720 2020-10-08 11:22:10 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Black women: They deny you your anger for the same reason they deny black men theirs. Pence's performance tonight showed that deprivation is about control.  If you do not feel entitled to your anger you will hesitate to express and wield it. You are being shamed into submission.
1314031624040914945 2020-10-08 10:35:27 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Meh
1314030218047356938 2020-10-08 10:29:52 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Time to play "Bullshit an 8th Grader."
1314030002363564033 2020-10-08 10:29:00 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Welcome to the Russian sponsored portion of this debate. Pence is spewing talking points straight from the Kremlin.
1314027774882074624 2020-10-08 10:20:09 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Nope. It was a live fly.  It flew away.  Must've been attracted to his bullshit.  It'll be back when he opens his mouth again.
1314027547529805824 2020-10-08 10:19:15 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Is that a dead fly on Pence's head?
1314027361604710401 2020-10-08 10:18:31 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Um...dafuq is this on his head?  https://t.co/xM6kN3vRAb
1314027029067640834 2020-10-08 10:17:11 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The grand jury didn't see all the options.  That story was released this week. Notice Pence dodged that while he talks about his faith in the justice system.
1314026783533084672 2020-10-08 10:16:13 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Uh oh. #BreonnaTaylor Blue lives racist dog whistle up next. Here comes the LAW AND ORDER...all caps...trademark pending.
1314026088071393280 2020-10-08 10:13:27 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Pence: Answer the question!  Everyone: You first you question  dodging bastard!
1314025354114326529 2020-10-08 10:10:32 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Yes, Pence. Trump is right to life unless he has to chug a Regeneron embryo milkshake to down some steroids.
1314023727009587202 2020-10-08 10:04:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @RadioKingKyle Thank you vice president Pence. Thank you vice president Pence. Thank you vice president Pence. Thank you vice president Pence. Thank you vice president Pence. Thank you vice president Pence. Thank you vice president Pence. Thank you vice president Pence. #VPDebate2020 #VPDebate
1314023331318898690 2020-10-08 10:02:30 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Pence is demanding time on top of the time he already stole! Why won't they just cut his fucking mic?!  Do we not have the technology?
1314022925436170242 2020-10-08 10:00:53 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Another smart move from Kamala. Let Pence run over time then demand equal time to fill that space with facts and more facts.
1314022280373166080 2020-10-08 09:58:19 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Pence: Instead of national policy I'd like to use a dead soldier as a prop if I may...  Thank you vice president Pence.
1314021625126359043 2020-10-08 09:55:43 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Russiagate defense from Pence inbound.  Ten bucks says he mentions that Hunter Biden and Burisma bullshit. Watch this fuckery.
1314019954828677121 2020-10-08 09:49:05 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Thank you vice president Pence. Thank you vice president Pence. Thank you vice president Pence. Thank you vice president Pence. Thank you vice president Pence.  Excellent moderation here Susan. Awesome. #VPDebate2020
1314019302069198849 2020-10-08 09:46:29 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @RadioKingKyle ...and you don't even know what the original reason for the meeting was for anymore.
1314018946882904064 2020-10-08 09:45:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> "Does climate change pose an existential threat?"  That was a yes or no question Pence, not a fucking propaganda preamble.
1314017958281256960 2020-10-08 09:41:09 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Half the country is on fire but yeah. A+ job with climate change climate science denier. #VPDebate2020
1314017468466290689 2020-10-08 09:39:12 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Actually it was smart to let Pence hang himself with his interruption. Kamala is able to demand last word dominance and have credibility to do so because Susan won't enforce the rules in real time.  This is killer code switch combat using Pence's rude racism/sexism against him.
1314016701365850114 2020-10-08 09:36:09 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Pence channeling his Ku Klux Kanye mic snatching skills...😒 Take your time back Kamala!
1314016165187006464 2020-10-08 09:34:01 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> We still have less jobs than we had at the beginning of the pandemic Pence.  We have not "bounced back."
1314015842087075844 2020-10-08 09:32:44 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Kamala is commanding this. Pence doesn't have anything to offer  as actual policy.  He's only defending.  You know why? Trump doesn't have a plan. Pence can only lie about broken promises.
1314015038903119874 2020-10-08 09:29:33 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Now if you're dumb as shit you're thinking Pence's depiction of Trump as a businessman is consistent. Its not. Trump has been hemorrhaging case for years.  Also notice that Pence ducked the question.
1314014633141981185 2020-10-08 09:27:56 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> 400 million dollar debt mentioned by Kamala. Pence readying the deflect. #VPDebate2020
1314014316442587136 2020-10-08 09:26:40 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> We should acknowledge the socialized care the president received that's not attainable by regular Americans?  That care Pence Puppet? #VPDebate2020
1314013743429361664 2020-10-08 09:24:24 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I love how fascists love comparing theoretical deaths their opponents COULD have been responsible for with ACTUAL ones they're responsible for as if they're one in the same. Only the dumb as hell can't recognize the false equivalency argument being made but that's their base.
1314012943093239808 2020-10-08 09:21:13 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Pence: I'd like to go back. Moderator: That's not possible- Pence: I'm going back.  Fucking fascists can't help themselves.
1314012599177142272 2020-10-08 09:19:51 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Would you take the Trump vaccine?  Kamala: Short answer? No. Long answer? Hell no...well maybe. #VPDebate2020
1314012170607382528 2020-10-08 09:18:09 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Pence front loads his responses with boilerpoint propaganda then gives actual half ass answers on the backend.  He's garbage. #VPDebate2020
1314011766087614465 2020-10-08 09:16:32 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Ugh. That's wasn't the question Pence.  What. The. Fuck. #VPDebate2020
1314010668970975233 2020-10-08 09:12:11 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I'm vice president Pence. Allow me to look directly into your face and sincerely bullshit the fuck out of you with my gaslight-o-tron.
1314009920023531522 2020-10-08 09:09:12 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Uh oh...Kamala opening with pandemic receipts. Pence attempting to make well regulated side eye contact. #VPDebate2020
1314009054688182273 2020-10-08 09:05:46 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Pence glided out like an animatronic...#VPDebate2020
1314008807312326664 2020-10-08 09:04:47 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Watching this via @NewsHour. Let me know if y'all see some craziness on other networks. #VPDebate2020
1314007546496200704 2020-10-08 08:59:46 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> So I see Pence lost that 'no barrier' battle. I guess putting them up for both parties doesn't call as much attention to the Whitehouse outbreak. #VPDebate
1313992211340632064 2020-10-08 07:58:50 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Diversity Experiment: If everyone "Black" disappeared how would your personal timeline change?  If the answer is 'not at all' have you ever wondered why that is?
1313975067299246085 2020-10-08 06:50:43 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> This is fucking genius...
1313965591879979011 2020-10-08 06:13:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Brandon you talk too much...  *Person who inevitably complains about me not talking.  **Person who wants my opinion.
1313963307762700289 2020-10-08 06:03:59 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Hey Gold Star families who shared the fascist company Trump recently! Bad news: Your loved one gave the ultimate sacrifice. Good news: You might be seeing them pretty soon? 👌🏿🙃👌🏿
1313959444980658176 2020-10-08 05:48:38 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Anyone go a whole day without talking these days then think of how weird your voice sounds out loud when you order at a drive thru? I'm out here trauma bonding with fast food workers.  Shit is getting real...with fries.
1313955728395247618 2020-10-08 05:33:52 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> "You know what they say, #Jeffs never learn. Should have followed instructions. Come on Buffy Alexis.
1313955726532935682 2020-10-08 05:33:51 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Real talk though, everyone should see the benefit of having unique names like Blacks have come to be known for. Imagine all the #Susans and #Jeffs we would be up to by now. "No, not that Jeff THAT was shot in his front yard. The OTHER Jeff that was shot in the car with his kids!"
1313955721873182720 2020-10-08 05:33:50 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Pact: 9 months from now no one names their kid Pandmikayla or Covidisha. I don't want to remember this shitshow....  Fuck. I'm too late aren't I?
1313948585302601730 2020-10-08 05:05:29 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Fascist Thom Tillis is throwing all KINDS of stones in his glass house...
1313937509487915011 2020-10-08 04:21:28 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Call me cynical but if Derek Chauvin can't be kept incarcerated until he stands trial for murdering someone as a civil servant in the middle of the street in broad daylight, I doubt there will be any real penalty for murdering 200K+ all over the country.
1313936717200658432 2020-10-08 04:18:19 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @yborgirl50 Yes. There is hope.
1313931672342200320 2020-10-08 03:58:17 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The doctors literally used his animated drugged up corpse to cheat the antibody test and make false propaganda of his COVID survival outlook like a big taxidummy.
1313906792422924288 2020-10-08 02:19:25 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> So...they detected the antibodies that they injected him with?
1313851570216472576 2020-10-07 22:39:59 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @SteveTroxlerNC is fascist paid and fascist approved.  Get hate out of our food chain.  Vote @jennawadsworth. #ncpol
1313719290302992384 2020-10-07 13:54:21 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Fascism is until everything isn't.
1313586621950971907 2020-10-07 05:07:10 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> This should terrify everyone. He knows what this will do to his poll numbers and he doesn't care.  That means he feels certain about stealing the election. He doesn't even have to pretend to care about COVID as the fascists force herd immunity experimentation on us all.
1313545357268332545 2020-10-07 02:23:12 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Fascists: They're killing babies!  *Trump mainlines a future toddler COVID cocktail and pops some roids*  Fascists: It's a Mussolini Miracle!
1313499584170205185 2020-10-06 23:21:19 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @CraigRozniecki Emasculation is a key component of fascist authoritarianism. This is an attempt to prove Biden is a beta to their overweight sick Alpha.
1313496584383016963 2020-10-06 23:09:23 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @achillesgirl @leroybrown000 Don't be upset. You're still on the good team. We just don't get to claim the modifier unilaterally.
1313493221637525510 2020-10-06 22:56:02 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @achillesgirl @leroybrown000 I know you don't want to see it but there's balance in all things and no absolutes afforded by the universe. If there is radical "good" there must be a radical "evil" and an ideology to accompany it.
1313490662399115266 2020-10-06 22:45:52 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I want a pet vampire demon for Christmas.  Deliver him to the Whitehouse.  I'll pick him up on New Year's Day.  #LovecraftCountry
1313489660509859844 2020-10-06 22:41:53 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @achillesgirl @leroybrown000 If the core of an ideology is death then genocide and mass murder are the purest form of that ideology. The more nonsensical and the more violent the better.
1313487085114982402 2020-10-06 22:31:39 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @achillesgirl @leroybrown000 I would argue that mass murder and genocide are radical concepts.
1313476463551819785 2020-10-06 21:49:26 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @achillesgirl @leroybrown000 Nah. It's the truth. People just don't want to see it. The fundamental nature of the "right" is selfishness baked into the very core of the ideology and covered with a veneer of righteousness afforded by a mythical being.
1313461176626487297 2020-10-06 20:48:42 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> What does a delusional narcissistic financially failing fascist with unstable violent white supremacists standing back and standing by do when he's at the end of his mayonnaise IV line?
1313458601302913026 2020-10-06 20:38:28 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Absolutely fucking no one:  DOCTORS: Give the mentally unstable overweight Russian controlled bubonically broke orange fascist some steroids.
1313457924858150913 2020-10-06 20:35:46 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> He keeps killing and ya'll praying for him. Wait...ya'll are praying to God right? I noticed that was left out of the instructions for some reason. Some of these fascists are praying to Trump himself.
1313418924143280129 2020-10-06 18:00:48 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Jesus be a blood clot.
1313418723882151936 2020-10-06 18:00:00 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @asfsdl @thedailyangle I know. Broken clock is right twice a day and all that...
1313413209144135681 2020-10-06 17:38:05 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Claudia Conway put her mother's real nature on blast and I'm here for it.
1313412328130576384 2020-10-06 17:34:35 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Oh FUCK no...but ya'll wanted to "pray" for his election stealing ass.
1313252871358607375 2020-10-06 07:00:58 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> For all those who wanted me to wish this piece of shit well as if getting better was going to stop making him be a piece of shit and cause him to NOT forward his narcissistic God complex enjoy his newly renewed death propaganda now with a new and improved resurrection narrative.
1313226618551373825 2020-10-06 05:16:39 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @danyasteele With a side of lies.
1313212741293953024 2020-10-06 04:21:30 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> They're gonna turn around and claim the fast food fascist rose in three days and turn him into some Big Mac Bigot Jesus now.
1313190517576998913 2020-10-06 02:53:11 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Pray for him so he gets better and sees justice in court!  *laughs in stolen migrant children* *laughs in slaughtered Kurd* *laughs in raped Katie Johnson* *laughs in Epstein didn't kill himself* *laughs in impeachment trial* *laughs in Susan Collins* *laughs in Pelosi slow clap*
1313189153341931527 2020-10-06 02:47:46 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 Glamour Shots? Yeah REALLY dating yourself. Which leads me to believe that you probably date yourself if this is an unpaid hobby of yours. This is unpaid right or does @SteveTroxlerNC cut a check? Wait, is this volunteer fascism for you? Do you still own Polaroids?
1313185034388598784 2020-10-06 02:31:24 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> If it was Trump, Melania would've pushed him closer as she pushed past him.
1313184273327849472 2020-10-06 02:28:23 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Two things prove this #Klandemic is a fascist hoax or a cult... 1. If there is a really is a cure on the horizon why would they risk their lives instead of wait? 2. Why would they expose their own children?
1313174678073204740 2020-10-06 01:50:15 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 If I wanted you gone I'd block you. You're here because I allow and want it. 🙃 It's a simple answer you should have since you've obviously applied effort. Considering you're grown it's that much more strange that you went this far with your time. No one refs mall photos in 2020.
1313171508420894721 2020-10-06 01:37:39 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 My attitude is still fun "champ." This is the fun part but I seem to have struck a nerve because you're dodging. Answer the question. How much of your life do you spend vicariously living through others looking for information for @SteveTroxlerNC? Or you can deflect again? 🙃
1313167580987830277 2020-10-06 01:22:03 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 So let's start with you telling everyone what stalking the public information of individuals does for you. Does @SteveTroxlerNC pay extra for that? Are these supposed to be threats or just sinple indicators that you're creepy and know how to use Facebook?
1313151216411725825 2020-10-06 00:17:01 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 Stalk harder. Give me more of your  time.
1313150821828308999 2020-10-06 00:15:27 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @JGeikie @NCAgriculture @SteveTroxlerNC @jennawadsworth She vote Jenna?
1313141466600964096 2020-10-05 23:38:17 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 Gotcha chief. You good?
1313136148642959363 2020-10-05 23:17:09 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 Nah. More like occupying space. While you're trolling me your limited resources are stretched elsewhere thereby allowing other posts to go unaddressed. Thanks for your time. Since you're willing to donate it, allow me to show my appreciation.
1313129798512844806 2020-10-05 22:51:55 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 You're on my profile? Again...do you understand how social media works? You obviously want attention...you're here and I'm not coming to you. Eventually you'll leave like all trolls do and be as forgotten as you were before you came.
1313125206450466817 2020-10-05 22:33:40 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 I know but you're somehow still here...failing. Hope those Smithfield checks from @SteveTroxlerNC don't bounce!
1313110246672433153 2020-10-05 21:34:13 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 @ACA_Sherpa Wait what? You're still here? Holy shit. How much is Troxler paying you to troll or is this dick ride pro-boner?
1313097265620422659 2020-10-05 20:42:38 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Is it just me or does Regeneron sound like an STD you get from fucking Decepticons?
1313070905518690304 2020-10-05 18:57:54 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Of course I've been rooting for death. What am I supposed to support? The criminal justice system?
1313050642097766400 2020-10-05 17:37:23 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @JohnsterFl @jennawadsworth We? Sound alike someone suffers from multiple personality disorder.
1313050387797209090 2020-10-05 17:36:22 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 @ACA_Sherpa Red light. 🙃
1312876467609653254 2020-10-05 06:05:16 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @ACA_Sherpa @KidSwagYolo1 True that. Upvotes have no real world commerce. It's the connections that do. But I guess if you simply spend time online and don't have a life you never make the connection @KidSwagYolo1.
1312864974923014146 2020-10-05 05:19:36 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 @ACA_Sherpa Greenlight.
1312501361506836480 2020-10-04 05:14:44 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 @ACA_Sherpa You're still here?
1312493886636343296 2020-10-04 04:45:02 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 @ACA_Sherpa we have a new fan. A little creepy but a new fan is a new fan I guess.
1312493624521711616 2020-10-04 04:43:59 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 Thanks for promoting the network! You should watch Rome's Rebellion. I think you'd like that show.
1312484535867637762 2020-10-04 04:07:52 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 Sorry. Tweet going viral. What were you saying again?
1312479191137284096 2020-10-04 03:46:38 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 That's a lot of all caps for someone who doesn't care.  Very comic book villain-y.
1312475795927920641 2020-10-04 03:33:09 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I'm not saying kill him but if he goes code blue it would be in the best interest of humanity to let him go. You ever seen a malignant racist genocidal narcissist with a god complex and a cult following before?  Yeah, I don't want to either.  Take a vape break if he flatlines.
1312466711816282112 2020-10-04 02:57:03 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The fascists picked someone to lead their thousand year Reich who couldn't handle a ten yard jog and now they have nothing but a 70-thousand-dollar fucked up hairline glued to a COVID infected KFC Klan leader in a hospital bed.
1312456743155163136 2020-10-04 02:17:26 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KatGkannon @jennawadsworth But you were triggered by my comment.  This discussion exists because of me.  Without my wall you're as irrelevant as Trump is to COVID. 🤣😂🤣
1312456337285017601 2020-10-04 02:15:49 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 Did I attack your follower account? Nah. I just pointed it out.  Are you ashamed of it?
1312442008640712707 2020-10-04 01:18:53 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KatGkannon @jennawadsworth I'm sorry.  Who are you again?  Did I say something about you?  🙃
1312441787819028481 2020-10-04 01:18:00 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 Your lack of followers and presence in this space that's supposedly  irrelevant yet relevant enough for you to maintain a dialogue about?
1312439452443176962 2020-10-04 01:08:44 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 And I don't want to stop calling attention to your inability to deflect from that fact.
1312439194921304065 2020-10-04 01:07:42 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KatGkannon @jennawadsworth Sorry. You thought this was a discourse of mutual respect? Anyone defending a pussygrabbing fascist piece of shit with racists on standby to enact violence is a subhuman piece of trash and barely entertainment to me. Someone like that might want to find another timeline to troll.
1312437411155066884 2020-10-04 01:00:37 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 But you can do that on your page...  Wait. 🤔  You do know the difference between your page and mine right? Protip: Yours is the one with way fewer followers.
1312436607786524672 2020-10-04 00:57:25 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KatGkannon @jennawadsworth Ok Pussygrabbing Sycophant.
1312436504862453760 2020-10-04 00:57:01 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KatGkannon @jennawadsworth There was no cause for alarm because we had leadership. 200K people didn't die because Obama didn't deny it existed and actually addressed it nationally early.  Trump did not.  You can't spin that. Do your research before you start lying.
1312436055207890946 2020-10-04 00:55:14 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 "I'm not interested in social media presence..."  But you're here. Next lie please.
1312433040333983746 2020-10-04 00:43:15 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KatGkannon @jennawadsworth Because I was born here and I can tell you to kiss my ass better domestically. Perhaps individuals excusing killing Americans via Trump's incompetence should get the fuck out?
1312432439965495298 2020-10-04 00:40:52 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KatGkannon @jennawadsworth I see the deflect is strong with you. How does the number of COVID dead surpass that of H1N1 again? When did we shut down the economy to address it? Where did Obama deny H1N1 existed?
1312432078655565825 2020-10-04 00:39:26 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 Well on a social media platform the amount of followers does legitimize the WEIGHT of your voice but the lack thereof indicates not only lack of social resonance but a limited  reach which would require you to grift off of larger accounts to attain recognition. Good luck to you.
1312431297516777472 2020-10-04 00:36:19 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KatGkannon @jennawadsworth The Chinese aren't responsible for Trump not wearing a mask and ending up in Walter Reed. That's all his own incompetence.
1312431091282780161 2020-10-04 00:35:30 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KatGkannon @jennawadsworth ...Then you have to give Obama credit for the exponentially higher number of Americans saved during the H1N1 pandemic and you've voided your whole argument. You're terrible at this. Stop while youre behind. You can't have it both ways. 🙃
1312430588679389190 2020-10-04 00:33:30 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KidSwagYolo1 12 followers since 2018? Did you log in JUST to make this troll comment?
1312430209908563972 2020-10-04 00:32:00 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KaySpeshel @jennawadsworth @BarackObama Lying is subjective...🤣😂🤣  I guess the only metric is the dead bodies left behind due to subjectivity. Trump has 200K dead Americans and rising. He's apparently the master of subjective death speech.
1312428355992588289 2020-10-04 00:24:38 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @terrancegavan Keep it abstract.  I could be talking about anyone. 🙃
1312427977725153281 2020-10-04 00:23:08 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KatGkannon @jennawadsworth The fact that you believe in wishes shows your lack of logic but then again karma doesn't care what you believe in as you wish for a genocidal fascist to get back to 100% health so he can continue to "wish ill will" on American citizens and facilitate the deaths of 200K more.
1312426928897482754 2020-10-04 00:18:58 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KaySpeshel @jennawadsworth @BarackObama Show me where 200K Americans died and Obama repeatedly lied to the public about it?
1312426265748688898 2020-10-04 00:16:20 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KatGkannon @jennawadsworth You mean the task force he disbanded because Obama made it? If only Trump swiftly caught it instead of lying for months about it and facilitating its spread we might not be 207K dead Americans down but COVID is working better late than never.
1312425436744429577 2020-10-04 00:13:02 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @KaySpeshel @jennawadsworth @BarackObama Show me where 200K Americans died from H1N1 and Obama lied about it first.
1312397150182092801 2020-10-03 22:20:38 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> *Grabs popcorn*  He dead yet?
1312307084516618240 2020-10-03 16:22:45 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Remember cooties? This administration is like cooties except everyone is coked up popping adderall with their fascist opioid addicted followers and they actually have cooties...  And it can kill you.
1312205103890231296 2020-10-03 09:37:31 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> These fascists dying by Russian roulette with COVID is some poetic shit.  Not gonna lie.
1312156692038074370 2020-10-03 06:25:08 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> For everyone saying I should pray for Trump, I'd like you to know that I did four years ago and God is real.   Stop blocking my blessing.
1312144034110955520 2020-10-03 05:34:50 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The people that wanted all the libs to "get owned" and are on standby to attack immigrants, jews, blacks, gays and outspoken women are attacking me for ridiculing Trump's self-inflicted medical condition but alas I harvested all my fucks a fornite ago and have not planted anew.
1312140060511281152 2020-10-03 05:19:03 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The post by @jennawadsworth mocked the hubris of an administration that lied to the American people to the tune of 207K deaths.  What's TRULY disgusting is the fact that NC conservatives are hypocritically blasting her while stand by the person whose inaction killed them.  #NCpol
1312082688824807426 2020-10-03 01:31:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I told you they were bioterrorist jihadists. Fascists don't even give a shit about each other. They just like pretending they do to distract from their greed and selfishness.
1312081127352545282 2020-10-03 01:24:52 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Here's to hope.
1312049400513003522 2020-10-02 23:18:48 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> We're not trapped in America with stupid racist lying science denying fascists.   Stupid racist lying science denying fascists are trapped in America with us.   #VOTE
1312012334777470976 2020-10-02 20:51:31 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @JonDoh_85 I'm hoping for a two piece at least.
1311988199108087810 2020-10-02 19:15:36 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> TRUMP SUPPORTERS: he'S StilL YOUR pREsideNT.  COVID19: Stand back and stand by.
1311987349371449345 2020-10-02 19:12:14 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> COVID19 do that thing you do where you kill stupid people.
1311883166861402115 2020-10-02 12:18:15 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Since he has to quarantine, @realDonaldTrump can be muted easily in a Zoom call for future debates. Just sayin.  ...Unless COVID is being used as an excuse to bitch out like a cowardly bitch due to a prior bitch like performance where he threw a tantrum like a lil 750 buck bitch.
1311741544739803137 2020-10-02 02:55:29 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Stand by for what?
1311724232548679685 2020-10-02 01:46:42 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trump: I have the best memory.   Trump: I don't know who the Proud Boys are even though my fascist mentor and Nixon-tattoo fanboy Roger Stone who I freed from jail uses them as security and they attend my rallies all the time.
1311697563674959873 2020-10-02 00:00:43 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> They're called Proud Boys because they don't have any women.  That's it.  That's the tweet.
1311416436389302275 2020-10-01 05:23:38 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The 'condemn white supremacy challenge' that's going around is hella awesome but could we have an "excommunicate anyone we know who supports a candidate who has FBI watchlist white supremacists on standby' challenge? Seems like a small actual meaningful step people could take.
1311348102704640007 2020-10-01 00:52:06 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I'm voting for the guy who doesn't have violent white supremacists on standby.
1311314003864547328 2020-09-30 22:36:36 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> How many of you have people standing back and standing by in your friends and family timelines? You realize that unless you agree with them, they're on hold to come after you too right? Trump put violence against you and yours on layaway to cash in come November 3rd if he loses.
1311277939313512449 2020-09-30 20:13:17 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Fucking facts.
1311277229180149761 2020-09-30 20:10:28 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @Jeff_Portland Thanks.  Got your back as well.  This is pure evil.
1311171623240728576 2020-09-30 13:10:50 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I don't know that many racists who take orders about who to be racist to from non-racists.  https://t.co/H6qGnvXl7W
1311154702948667392 2020-09-30 12:03:35 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Who do you owe 400 million dollars to and how do you plan to pay that debt without using taxpayer dollars? #ThingsJoeShouldaSaid
1311154270574702594 2020-09-30 12:01:52 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> How long will it take a billion newly planted trees to grow to maturity and will that be soon enough to effectively address global climate change? #ThingsJoeShouldaSaid
1311153857481904129 2020-09-30 12:00:14 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Police unions supported you before or after you defunded them by not paying your taxes? #ThingsJoeShouldaSaid
1311153520360525824 2020-09-30 11:58:53 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Let's talk about your 70K fucked up hairline...#ThingsJoeShouldaSaid
1311151898813255680 2020-09-30 11:52:27 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I'm impressed. It only took four years and one well timed question during a shitshow of a presidential debate to go from "prove Trump is racist" to "prove Trump ISN'T racist."
1311148607781900289 2020-09-30 11:39:22 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trump: I've done more for the blacks than anyone...  ALSO Trump: White supremacists stand back and stand by....
1311134999786270720 2020-09-30 10:45:18 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> This debate was sponsored by guns and ammo magazine.
1311134917636620295 2020-09-30 10:44:58 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Still think he's leaving peacefully?  I'll bet you 750.00 he doesn't.
1311133015909773315 2020-09-30 10:37:25 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Next debate needs to be held via Zoom call so you can mute Trump's mic at the 2:00 mark. Chris Wallace is too passive for this format.
1311130862457556992 2020-09-30 10:28:51 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Back up a sec...he told white supremacists to "stand down and stand by' because "something needs to be done about the radical left."  That was a literal call to sedition.
1311128389697273856 2020-09-30 10:19:02 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The west coast is on fire and we're doing "well."  https://t.co/73nGGrTgcY

1311127160313315330 2020-09-30 10:14:09 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Those openings were stolen by Mitch McConnell.
1311126534271447041 2020-09-30 10:11:39 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> President Trump. Who is the president of Antifa?
1311125353914609667 2020-09-30 10:06:58 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trump you jackass aren't you running the country right now though? Joe is horrible at the punch back. Hit this fascist Putin owned fuckwit low and hard. Keep swinging but nah...he ain't bout that life.
1311124857443299328 2020-09-30 10:05:00 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> This is Trump's America though...
1311123415886114822 2020-09-30 09:59:16 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Because of lack of an actual moderator with fact checkers, this was always destined to be free fascist presser for Trump.
1311122318291238913 2020-09-30 09:54:54 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Race:  Here we go.
1311122254353268738 2020-09-30 09:54:39 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trump: Allow me to interrupt your interruption to discuss this interruption.
1311120455877693440 2020-09-30 09:47:30 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trump: "We've done things you never would have thought of..."  Answer: YES.  LIKE FORCED CONCENTRATION CAMP HYSTERECTOMIES.  This shit should be fucking easy.  What the fuck Joe?!!

1311118740411551747 2020-09-30 09:40:41 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trump is literally spewing fascist rhetoric regarding herd immunity in real time.
1311117541356564480 2020-09-30 09:35:55 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trump: *insult* Joe: *chuckle*  me:  wtf
1311117183817318401 2020-09-30 09:34:30 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> On the other hand the guy who stares at the sun and can't spell hamburger just called Biden dumb.
1311117023699664896 2020-09-30 09:33:52 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Joe just shushed Trump.  Seriously.
1311116008313294850 2020-09-30 09:29:50 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Joe is all that stands between us and fascism.  I am kind of uncomfortable right now.  Not gonna lie.
1311114978108280835 2020-09-30 09:25:44 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Fascists are great with rhetoric.
1311114890455678982 2020-09-30 09:25:23 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The problem with the Democrats tonight is two-fold.  One is that they're not built for the mud.  That's where we are.  Two is that because of corporate interests they can't outline policy or make guarantees.  Unfortunately that makes repair rhetoric a hard sell.
1311114432278335488 2020-09-30 09:23:34 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> That's right Joe.  Tell a fascist to "shut up" that worked SO well against shutting down Hitler.
1311113756290813954 2020-09-30 09:20:53 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> So Trump is just slinging racial slurs AND lies unchecked in real time.
1311112554027118592 2020-09-30 09:16:06 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Oh shit.  Joe is not built for this...
1311112394685534211 2020-09-30 09:15:28 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Holy shit. Fox moderator. Trump spewing lies.  Trump is allowed to run all over Joe.  This is crap.
1311111677971054594 2020-09-30 09:12:37 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I need Joe to hit harder. This some high road numbers bullshit. You're fighting a cult of personality my dude.
1311110914247200768 2020-09-30 09:09:35 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Dems were stopped from appointing Merrick Garland by who you fat fascist tax dodging fuck?!
1311110331066912768 2020-09-30 09:07:16 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trump popped out from behind the curtain like...  https://t.co/KcY9V7I3iA
1311110010894782465 2020-09-30 09:06:00 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Two minute answers my ass.. Trump is violating that from response one. Watch this shit...
1311109698393985027 2020-09-30 09:04:45 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I'm watching this on YouTube. I made they running on CP time?
1311108591823261698 2020-09-30 09:00:22 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Alright let's do this...
1311055051012616197 2020-09-30 05:27:37 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Remember that time Trump handed a whole American military base over to Russian forces in Syria?  I wonder how much that knocked off the interest on his debt to Putin?
1311048946815512576 2020-09-30 05:03:21 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @m1db @American4Love @atrupar Weirdest way to commit suicide ever.
1310989862896578562 2020-09-30 01:08:34 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trump: I grab women by the pussy. Fascists: Locker room talk. Katie Johnson: He grabbed me. E. Jean Carroll: He grabbed me too. Stormy: He paid to grab me. Ghislane Maxwell: I was paid to find pussy for him to grab. Migrants In Camps: He has literally stolen parts of our vaginas.
1310985456058859525 2020-09-30 00:51:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I will say this: Trump is a fascist piece of shit but he's only playing the game the system was built to allow. If you build a system that rewards lying thieving wife-abusing pussygrabbing racists and never punishes them don't be surprised when a few show up and refuse to leave.
1310790260356452352 2020-09-29 11:55:26 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Translation: I'm a crazy ass wine witch and I printed up a bunch of ballots in China and stored them in my barn to help Trump when the time is right.
1310689038819635201 2020-09-29 05:13:12 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @ksonnichsen #TrumpSoBroke he shoots his OnlyYams content with a flip phone.
1310687779869929472 2020-09-29 05:08:12 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @ksonnichsen #TrumpSoBroke the whole country ran out of loose change to give him.
1310687088837361667 2020-09-29 05:05:28 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @ksonnichsen #TrumpSoBroke he hired nothing but roaches to be in his administration.
1310665639976153089 2020-09-29 03:40:14 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Now you see why Trump is easily distracted. He's so broke he can't even pay attention.
1310635878218444802 2020-09-29 01:41:58 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> He's avoided taxes, the draft and national security briefings...  The only things that Trump can't seem to dodge are hookers, hamburgers and phone calls from Putin.
1310583612589436928 2020-09-28 22:14:17 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Feckless? ✅ Fraudulent? ✅ Fascist? ✅ Failure. ✅  #TrumpTaxReturns
1310413706115850240 2020-09-28 10:59:08 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Fascists are shit populists. They're too selfish to give a fuck about anyone but themselves. That's why Nazis always have to fake it until they break it. Today's tax revelation proves that they will literally fuck over anyone for a dollar. We have 200K dead Americans to prove it.
1310370941629759489 2020-09-28 08:09:12 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I feel cheap. Trump paid Stormy Daniels 130,000 and she only had to fuck him once. Trump paid America 750 dollars and fucked us for four years.
1310364195263844354 2020-09-28 07:42:24 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I WAS big on eating the rich to solve America's financial woes but after today's tax revelations it's obvious that Trump isn't only saturated with fat and preservatives but he doesn't even qualify for the menu.  I'm going vegan.
1310362301086740481 2020-09-28 07:34:52 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Fake billionaire Trump has defrauded the American government and people for years by breaking the law repeatedly and not paying his taxes or as fascists like to say:  He's smart.
1310233597329145857 2020-09-27 23:03:27 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @Walshton_21 Hell yes it will. I'll be dead once but whoever takes me out will be Officer Dickgrabber for the rest of their lives. His dickgrabbing legacy will pass on to his children for a thousand disgraced dickgrabbing generations. This is the way.
1310229565873238018 2020-09-27 22:47:26 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> "I can't breathe..." "I don't have a gun stop shooting..." "What are you following me for..."  Amateurs. I'M stripping butt ass naked so as to pose no visible threat and forcing the cops to arrest me by hand. While they choke me out I'm screaming proudly:  Stop touching my dick.
1310224769485361157 2020-09-27 22:28:22 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Hitler was actually quite generous because he not only taught us the horrors of fascism so we never have to repeat them but also demonstrated how to effectively end it by shooting himself in the head. It just happened 6 million dead Jews too late. What are we at again here? 200K?
1309981794998128648 2020-09-27 06:22:52 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The sooner they get these things on the streets the sooner they can defund the police and pay some corporation to do their job instead. What fascists don't realize is that defunding the police is inevitable. The question is simply how it will be done and who will profit.
1309644702908583942 2020-09-26 08:03:23 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> She's miles ahead of the big agriculture bought Steve Troxler and doesn't just seek to engage with rural farmers but wants to connect people all over NC with their locally owned and controlled food supply chains again. We need her.
1309639464629739523 2020-09-26 07:42:34 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @ShawLaserEye @jennawadsworth Your account has been around since 2015 and you have 11 followers. This brainless bullshit is why.
1309630282908213248 2020-09-26 07:06:05 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trump just selected Amy Coney Barrett to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Unfortunately she hasn't been permitted to speak or come out of the kitchen so there's no word yet on when her husband will approve the nomination.
1309626447829622786 2020-09-26 06:50:51 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Have you retweeted your favorite politician that's running to unfuck the country from fascist control over our food production today?   Here's mine: @jennawadsworth
1309562469984206850 2020-09-26 02:36:37 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Fascists think that everyone secretly wants to be white but personally if I were any other race, I'd definitely try out being native american for a day just to walk around with that indigenous get-the-fuck-off-my-lawn energy.
1309468265278828545 2020-09-25 20:22:17 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Tory Lanez dropping an album about shooting a black woman the same week cops are cleared for shooting a black woman is bold as hell but the reception by his fans is even more savage. Apparently the cops that killed #BreonnaTaylor should just drop a hot mixtape and all is forgiven
1309347289442463744 2020-09-25 12:21:34 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> When Blacks stopped being property they stopped being important.  - fascists
1309337345867550720 2020-09-25 11:42:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> It was a total accident but #BreonnaTaylor absolutely deserved it.  - fascists
1309318203726848000 2020-09-25 10:26:00 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Anyone into politics (and humanity in general) needs to watch and share because @jennawadsworth has some solutions that transcend borders. Fresh food, clean water and clean air should not be fucking luxuries.
1309256062160244738 2020-09-25 06:19:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I'm live in 45...🙃
1309240495995060224 2020-09-25 05:17:13 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @VotingBlueInTX @slpng_giants @Facebook She would be nothing otherwise.
1309176858622210058 2020-09-25 01:04:21 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> When the world is on fire, racism is the ultimate luxury.  https://t.co/1jx3a1hEE2
1309153807406903302 2020-09-24 23:32:45 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Fuck this fascist. 👌🏿🤣👌🏿
1309152815244292098 2020-09-24 23:28:48 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @Rachelle_jdh It does help. Violence releases tension and validates anger for those who have received no validation otherwise. A riot is the language of the unheard. We don't ask hungry children to stop crying. We don't expect abused animals not to attack us. We expect adults to accept abuse.
1309125702566973447 2020-09-24 21:41:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @Rachelle_jdh It changed but the line of what has been considered acceptable in suppressing the protests changed with it with no systemic adjustment or response. No meaningful action has resulted from that change save a normalization of protest and now  we see justice isn't to be expected too.
1309115538795368449 2020-09-24 21:00:41 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @Rachelle_jdh There's no public opinion left to change. Either you see this as injustice or you don't. That's where we are now. If you see it as injustice and you realize that the corrupt have their fingers on the levers of power with no intention relinquishing them there's no other recourse.
1309110796669026306 2020-09-24 20:41:50 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> *violent
1309109490072068097 2020-09-24 20:36:39 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @Rachelle_jdh I fail to see what's supposed to work instead when all other options have been explored to the point of exhaustion.
1309108461595172864 2020-09-24 20:32:33 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Fuck this shit and anyone pretending like cops were victims here just following fucked up orders. Nazis didn't get away with that softserve shit excuse in Nuremberg either.  What you normalize becomes normal and apologists are simply exposing the inequity they're fine with.
1309108460383019015 2020-09-24 20:32:33 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> No surveillance. No drugs. No evidence. Now we're drowned in the din of the scurrying of racist roaches retroactively rationalizing another excessive use of force that we're supposed to accept blindly and the ascension of yet another unresolved hashtag without justice.
1309108458889916421 2020-09-24 20:32:33 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The warrant NEVER should have been signed to kick in the door of THAT residence at 3AM.  Period.  The only justifiable reason for doing so wouldve been fear of video surveillance giving warning and leading to evidence being preemptively destroyed.  Surprise. They found none.
1309108456973103104 2020-09-24 20:32:32 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> How about cut the racist selective bootlicking outrage? Police have become open tools of a fascist state and the first thing to go is the pretense of protocol. This is where we are now. This is what we're sanctioning. This is our new "justice." This is beyond bullshit.
1309108455832203265 2020-09-24 20:32:32 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Meanwhile we have a president surrounded by sycophants being paid our tax dollars to literally lie daily, destroy democracy, break laws and steal elections to the tune of 201,000 dead Americans without consequence while fascists applaud.
1309108454578061312 2020-09-24 20:32:32 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> It's nothing but gaslighting to pretend there isn't a clear difference between true violent offenders, sociopaths and societal predators and the menace a 20-something Black nurse posed to society for *checks notes* supposedly handling money for her drug dealer boyfriends.
1309108453076619264 2020-09-24 20:32:31 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Meanwhile #BreonnaTaylor gets her door kicked in (after a COVID fighting extended nursing stint by the way) is shot to death UNARMED and the unmitigated zeal in the rush to justification is fucking disgusting.
1309108451780505600 2020-09-24 20:32:31 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The drug dealer excuse? The opioid crisis IS killing and addicting millions RIGHT NOW but I don't see lethal no knock warrants being executed at pharmaceutical companies for some reason and the wives of CEOs riddled with bullets. It's just so STRANGE, no?
1309108450471956484 2020-09-24 20:32:31 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The violence offender excuse? A 17-year-old murderer is allowed open carry then kill only to walk past cops and turn himself in later. Billionaire bankers destroy the economy and countless lives and we just shrug and print more cash to replace it because they're too big to fail.
1309108449037426689 2020-09-24 20:32:30 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> There is a systemic discrepancy being grossly ignored and failure to acknowledge that there are multiple routes for justice in this country but the path forged for people of color repeatedly leads to their untimely demise before they can stand before a jury to receive it.
1309108445036113923 2020-09-24 20:32:30 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Her BoyfRIeNd wAS a Drug dEALer! sHE WAsn'T AslEep! shE MaNAgED dRug moNEy!  The bullshit excuses and justifications flow like water for murdering #BreonnaTaylor...
1308862436171231248 2020-09-24 04:14:56 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Arrest the people that sent the cops that killed #BreonnaTaylor.
1308814289051021312 2020-09-24 01:03:37 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> My interview with @jennawadsworth airs tonight but you can check this one out while you wait!
1308790745298595852 2020-09-23 23:30:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> This just in: Journalists are trying to find a way to "both sides" their own assaults to avoid losing advertising revenue from conservatives.
1308772539368435714 2020-09-23 22:17:43 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> You forgot Winston-Salem State University.
1308767357536481281 2020-09-23 21:57:08 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @TheCPUTutor Self oppression is a favorite oppression of authoritarians.  It's cheap, easy and low maintenance.
1308539260090355712 2020-09-23 06:50:45 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @FloydGump And the more ignorant and desperate you are.
1308487510004314112 2020-09-23 03:25:07 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Not gonna lie. If I were Candace Owens, Kanye, Diamond or Silk, or any other bootlicking sycophant of color I'd say Trump calling Herman Cain one of the 200,000 "virtual nobodies" who died of COVID would be a huge red flag that would make me reconsider my loyalty to him.
1308452122791415808 2020-09-23 01:04:30 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Eric Trump is too busy counting Ws in M&amp;M bags to sit down for a deposition apparently.   https://t.co/EyKBeKpJaQ
1308185267749167106 2020-09-22 07:24:07 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Interviewing DNC candidate for NC agricultural commissioner @jennawadsworth at 740 tonight to air tomorrow. Let me know what questions you might have for her!
1308107980345348096 2020-09-22 02:17:00 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> An impeached president accused of multiple counts of sexual assault while committing genocidal crimes against humanity shouldn't be able to pick the potential officiant of his trial as that undermines the justice process with a gross conflict of interest but you know whatevs...
1308073391987937280 2020-09-21 23:59:34 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I just uploaded “091120PlightDark” to #Vimeo:  https://t.co/9Di8XoCtzt
1308030654542761984 2020-09-21 21:09:44 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @discovolante78 @ProudSocialist @4aPeoplesParty Sounds prophetic. Proof that enough people are going g to wake up as a viable third option by election day in less than 2 months to drown Trump voters AND the Democrats in a landslide?  We're waiting.
1308029167691345920 2020-09-21 21:03:50 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @angel_castelar @ProudSocialist Except a progressive without a viable plan is nothing more than an agent for capitulation to fascism.
1307768010648715270 2020-09-21 03:46:05 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @discovolante78 @ProudSocialist @4aPeoplesParty Cool story. Why won't it?
1307764786135011330 2020-09-21 03:33:16 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @ProudSocialist @4aPeoplesParty We can't even get people to wear masks to save lives but you think you can mobilize the 40% of voters that didn't participate in 2016 to spontaneously break a financially entrenched two party duopoly in less than a month during a fascist genocide with what...thoughts and prayers?
1307703960778797059 2020-09-20 23:31:34 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Right now there's a MAGA fascist in church who seriously thinks God agrees with their support of their  genocide against other people that same God created.  https://t.co/vf3yTYwrCl
1307355887795949572 2020-09-20 00:28:27 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @heyshachi I disagree. That's enough time for them to put up a facade of respect and pretend that their insistence to find a replacement is purely out of duty to the country. Acknowledging their behavior IN THE MOMENT proves that those empty concerns are bullshit. Expose them immediately.
1307161559295299584 2020-09-19 11:36:16 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @heyshachi The threat is now.
1307161432677650432 2020-09-19 11:35:46 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> If you're real quiet you can hear fascists whispering about how they're going to justify and rationalize letting an accused rapist (who is openly working with Russia to steal the election) appoint a supreme court vacancy that would determine his own fate in an election year.
1307159556494176256 2020-09-19 11:28:18 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> No disrespect to Ruth Bader Ginsburg but to be honest if our whole system hinges on the life of one elderly person with health issues, don't you think it's a tad bit flawed?
1307131923706281986 2020-09-19 09:38:30 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> If you want to spot a fascist they're easy to identify tonight.  They're the ones celebrating the death of #RuthBaderGinsburg and the thought of undoing everything she ever stood for.
1307076371823329280 2020-09-19 05:57:46 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @reaIdonaIdtripe You hold rallies with fascists packed together with less personal space between them than you and a teenage beauty pageant contestant.
1307058302480789504 2020-09-19 04:45:57 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Steve Troxler...the farming fascist.  Time to elect @jennawadsworth.

1306670908996759552 2020-09-18 03:06:36 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @MarshaBlackburn This just in: Marsha Blackburn thinks a Black person is still three fifths of a human being.
1306666990870974464 2020-09-18 02:51:01 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I'm pretty sure all Trump does at this point is golf, rape and lie about both.
1306663909496098820 2020-09-18 02:38:47 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Here's a viral media challenge that costs nothing: pick a candidate you support at the local level and post about them DAILY to your social media following of friends, family and coworkers from this day until the election.  * Extra points if the candidate doesn't support fascism.
1306660733229445128 2020-09-18 02:26:10 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Who would've thought that a president that openly mocked the disabled, ridiculed veterans, ignored soldiers being subjected to bounties, lied about a pandemic, stole PPE from states to resell it back to them for profit and used tear gas on moms would be SO into fascist eugenics?!
1306590397150396417 2020-09-17 21:46:40 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Worshipping the construct of race by subscribing to it is a specific kind of idolatry that demands a blood sacrifice buy in. Fascism compels submission via complicity in this death cult. Trumpism solicits the simple to a Danse Macabre. The price of admission is your humanity.
1306542280694788098 2020-09-17 18:35:28 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Just your daily reminder that the Trump administration with the aid of fascist supporters are actively conducting a holocaust and forcibly removing the reproductive organs of women in concentration camps. This is not acceptable nor normal however they are absolutely fine with it.
1306535360990777346 2020-09-17 18:07:58 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @FloydGump Agreed. This is why I normally avoid incorporating the construct of race when referring to any section of the population because it naturally results in generalization and feeds into race division. Apologies if I offended. I'm aware not all those identified as white are fascists.
1306271368477016070 2020-09-17 00:38:58 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> You realize when American fascism has consumed all the brown, female, physically and mentally impaired, and non- fake Christians, and homosexuals they're subjugating the rest of the white poor that they're using already?  I dunno why poor white people think Trump gives a shit.
1306005810787553280 2020-09-16 07:03:44 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I'm on.
1305979610711162882 2020-09-16 05:19:37 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @LibRepCons @CNNPolitics @CNNnewsroom No. He didn't. He even lied during the ceremony. Two states is NOT the middle east.
1305938824137183242 2020-09-16 02:37:33 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @LibRepCons @CNNPolitics @CNNnewsroom Again. Statehood isn't a prerequisite for peace. The conflict between Palestinians and Israel goes all the way back to the formation of the created state of Israel. There is no peace between Israel and the UN recognized STATE of Palestine. Peace accord failed.
1305938236817256451 2020-09-16 02:35:13 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Notice how all the #savethechildren #alllivesmatter prolifers are completely silent about the forced hysterectomies being performed at ICE detention facilities?  They're fine.  They're complicit.  They agree. This is how Hitler got away with conducting genocide in broad daylight.
1305935806415204354 2020-09-16 02:25:34 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @LibRepCons @CNNPolitics @CNNnewsroom Even your anecdote fails your own logic test. Was your cancer cured by you saying it or the cancer actually being gone?
1305933724161376256 2020-09-16 02:17:17 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @LibRepCons @CNNPolitics @CNNnewsroom Still deflecting from my original point. You cannot simply declare a cure for cancer. You have to end the actual cancer. Same goes for peace. Bon of those "cures" you've mentioned are actual cure unless they cure. Peace isn't attained unless there is actual peace and there isn't.
1305931189350522880 2020-09-16 02:07:13 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @LibRepCons @CNNPolitics @CNNnewsroom Apparently you have statehood as a prerequisite for peace. I'm sorry you're wrong but peace has no such qualifier. Simply ignoring a valid conflict and declaring a confrontation to be irrelevant doesn't make it go away. You can't pretend away conflict like Trump tried with COVID.
1305929668130988032 2020-09-16 02:01:10 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @LibRepCons @CNNPolitics @CNNnewsroom Wait. So you're saying that they're shooting rockets? That doesn't sound peaceful at all...what's being celebrated again? Something about peace in the middle east but with no actual peace? Sounds like a cure for cancer BUT there's still cancer.  Are you SURE you're ok?
1305927408827146240 2020-09-16 01:52:11 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @LibRepCons @CNNPolitics @CNNnewsroom Why does it need to be? We are talking about peace. A huge subsection of the population is responsible for helping to attain that, stolen land or not. Are you ok?
1305925512666263554 2020-09-16 01:44:39 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @CNNPolitics @CNNnewsroom So when were the Palestinians consulted?
1305922852240216065 2020-09-16 01:34:05 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> With an increase of food deserts because of land development and upcoming food scarcity as a result of climate change, @jennawadsworth's plan to put a garden in every school is a community game changer that educates young people about agriculture while addressing food insecurity.
1305892057677004802 2020-09-15 23:31:43 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Emailed you. I'd like to talk to you about this @josie_huang.
1305874772572745729 2020-09-15 22:23:02 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Mark Zuckerberg created a corporate sponsored perpetual digital fascist klan rally and kitten photo sharing machine and now he won't turn it off because...profits. Tell me again how unchecked free markets police themselves?  This is how capitalism eats itself without governors.
1305873746733993984 2020-09-15 22:18:57 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I don't need to radicalize my kids. My kids kids will radicalize my kids just like they did me. No one wants their children growing up in a barren fascist hellscape. I never understood why fighting for humanity was considered a radical concept to begin with.
1305871493080002562 2020-09-15 22:10:00 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @MKap21 @kanyewest Naw. I just watched the congressional hearings with Lt. Alex Vindman and pay attention to these pesky things fascists hate called   *checks notes*   Facts. Kanye has a better chance making a hit record than becoming president while committing election fraud to get on ballots.
1305866830108655616 2020-09-15 21:51:28 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @MKap21 @kanyewest Haha. Yes.
1305865209077215235 2020-09-15 21:45:02 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @kanyewest Naw fam. You're Putin's Pied Piper and it's really fucking sad.
1305864504388055040 2020-09-15 21:42:14 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trump supporters are cosigning this fascist shit.
1305713586334052352 2020-09-15 11:42:32 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Fascists traffick in hate because they're not only sadistic but cheap. Traditional advertising costs money. Papers, press junkets, and rallies are expensive. Hate is distributed for free. Attach a message to hate and it will travel internationally borne on backs of bigoted birds.
1305649766253166592 2020-09-15 07:28:56 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Tillis is ready to inject frontline workers with a fast tracked vaccine first.   What could go wrong? @CalforNC
1305640324082085891 2020-09-15 06:51:25 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> By killing to defend race, fascists literally impose the broken construct upon the world by force and power. Those herded into the categories created are forced to defend themselves from repeated abominations of brutality. Thus race is MADE real by manifesting death.
1305634497644421121 2020-09-15 06:28:16 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Daily reminder that race is a lie and fascists are willing to kill to defend the social construct that even science has dismissed. That's part of why fascists are so rabid about anti-intellectualism.  The other part is sadism.
1305515697766793216 2020-09-14 22:36:12 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Conservatives: CUTIES IS CHILD PORN!  Me: But "Toddlers and Tiaras" ran for 9 seasons tho...
1305253995431309313 2020-09-14 05:16:17 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Thanks for this. This is 21st century junk mail and robs people of the most valuable asset they have: time.
1305253471046774787 2020-09-14 05:14:12 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @peplinskioregon Glad to have you here.
1305209497447735299 2020-09-14 02:19:28 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> It's amazing that the state agriculture commissioner @SteveTroxlerNC has said nothing about Smithfield spreading COVID. He must be spending all his energy ignoring how they pollute NC communities of color with hog blood and feces. We need to vote @jennawadsworth to fix this NOW.
1304861138052689920 2020-09-13 03:15:13 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I wonder what a never ending fire season does to property values? A nice view means nothing if you can't breathe the air and your kids can't play outside. It's such a shame climate change isn't real, right?
1304834691208564742 2020-09-13 01:30:07 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Forget the elections.  First party candidate to say the Pledge of Allegiance with no mistakes after a spelling, history, geography, science and drug test wins.
1304793993813909505 2020-09-12 22:48:24 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Bigots will quickly blame China for COVID while excusing Trump's hypocrisy but @SteveTroxlerNC takes the whole hog as he pockets money from Chinese owned Smithfield Company who let COVID spread in their factories in NC and failed to protect employees. Vote @jennawadsworth instead
1304792481746296833 2020-09-12 22:42:24 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Ok J-Wad this was dope. I see you. 🙃 #WadSquad
1304791121550290944 2020-09-12 22:36:59 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @46mingo @jennawadsworth That dictates NC Agricultural policy by buying off lifelong politicians like @SteveTroxlerNC.
1304788740536258562 2020-09-12 22:27:32 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I wonder why Steve Troxler hasn't said anything about this? Oh probably because he has his bank account so far up Smithfield's ass his tax returns smell like raw chitterlings. That's why I'm voting @jennawadsworth in NC.  https://t.co/1T2SYhPiN1
1304788012849606656 2020-09-12 22:24:38 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Holy shit...ok. I need answers @marilynmanson. Has he commented on this?
1304548243121082374 2020-09-12 06:31:53 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> 200,000 dead is a LOT of crisis actors for Soros to pay for while funding antifa pedophile child eating soldiers but I have to admit getting Trump to lie about everything as a narrative to drive the civilian bodycount is impressive...or maybe MAGA fascism is bullshit. Idk.
1304543509299580929 2020-09-12 06:13:04 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I'm not saying #AllCountriesMatter but we never celebrate the day we did Operation: Whatever and bombed the shit out of civilians in Somethingsomething-stan. It truly is fucked up all around that both don't matter equally. Then again we'd be grieving all the time wouldn't we?
1304535639203995649 2020-09-12 05:41:48 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> How's your 401K?  Cool? Awesome.   Sidebar.  The entire west coast is on fire and the ashes and heat are changing the weather. This is climate change.
1304534743120306179 2020-09-12 05:38:14 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> I and others are competing for your attention with a known and admitted grabber of p*ssy and indicted pedophile with an outstanding rape case pending he won't give exculpatory DNA evidence for.   That says SO much.
1304534063060054023 2020-09-12 05:35:32 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The vulgarity brings spectacle. The spectacle brings dialogue. The dialogue leads to solutions. Get people talking and they work shit out...or you could be a fascist and worship 911 dead while they sacrificed 200K to their orange fascist lying God. That's real hate.
1304533001892659201 2020-09-12 05:31:19 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> You NEED me here... But Before you think it's ego We need YOU here too. Except for the fascists. They don't need anyone. Ask them. THEY say so.
1304510781434793984 2020-09-12 04:03:01 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trump recited the pledge of allegiance perfectly!  The words just didn't match his lips on camera because he was saying it in Russian.
1304376615649136647 2020-09-11 19:09:53 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Marilyn Manson dropped a new album and I haven't even heard it yet but it's on repeat. @marilynmanson
1304228627836473347 2020-09-11 09:21:50 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Trump shook Herman Cain's hand and lied straight to his face until he died while calling him a friend and taking his unwavering support.  This is who the fascists worship as their greatest of leaders and men.
1304140294464696320 2020-09-11 03:30:50 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Don't stop...I'm almost there...🤣
1304118099852103683 2020-09-11 02:02:39 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Fun Fact: Blaming Lindsay Graham for Trump snitching on himself to Bob Woodward for hours makes Trump look way more easily manipulated and stupid than it makes Graham look like a backstabbing spineless snake, Republicans. Just saying.
1304110937310461952 2020-09-11 01:34:11 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @tr_resident Alexander Vindman and countless other people with established decorated histories of integrity have tried to warn us about Trump and no one listened. I don't get why people expected Woodward to have the magic words they're STILL denying he meant.
1304053316289212416 2020-09-10 21:45:13 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Woodward should have spoken up sooner so his evidence could've been ignored like all of the rest as he openly rigs the election and tells his followers to vote twice with no consequence.
1304023219293294594 2020-09-10 19:45:37 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> You know who would be a perfect replacement for Ruth Bader Ginsburg? Ted Cruz.  - no sane person ever.   And that's why I'm voting for Biden.
1304001559483867136 2020-09-10 18:19:33 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> These Trump revelations are so damning that Republicans are going to get to the bottom of attacking whoever informed everybody as soon as possible.
1303999077819068416 2020-09-10 18:09:41 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> "I never downplayed the virus."  Says the person who headlined the maskless RNC COVIDpalooza a couple weeks ago.
1303996856175931392 2020-09-10 18:00:52 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @tesa_silva @JohnFugelsang Probably because after 4 years of seeing our broken democracy's inability to punish anyone in this impeached administration for flagrantly breaking the law he figured this would be the opportune time when it couldn't be swept under the rug by the next scandal before the election.
1303992087814209536 2020-09-10 17:41:55 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @badbitchinaz Here's to hope.
1303990966504824832 2020-09-10 17:37:28 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> If you want to see a p*ssy in general, ask Trump which of his generals he called p*ssy.
1303988359262593024 2020-09-10 17:27:06 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Downplay is the name of my Trump themed Coldplay cover band I'm starting when this is all over.
1303987490307682304 2020-09-10 17:23:39 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Now that we know what and when Trump knew and that he didn't care about letting people die for political security and convenience, can we call his intentional COVID misdirection and mishandling a genocide? Asking for 200 thousand dead Americans and countless suckers and losers.
1303985120131641344 2020-09-10 17:14:14 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Since Trump lied about knowing about the severity of COVID and allowed 200 thousand Americans to die without an adequate response, vaccine or acknowledgement of responsibility he's sure to get the Nobel Rest In Peace Prize this year.
1303898518759903237 2020-09-10 11:30:06 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> So the guy who called veterans suckers and losers, his own generals p*ssies, intentionally downplayed the pandemic and is demanding that we cover his legal fees for a rape accusation now wants us to inject ourselves with a fast tracked vaccine right before this election? Nah fam.
1303852326734770176 2020-09-10 08:26:33 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @PattiFirrincili Yup.
1303820864866131969 2020-09-10 06:21:32 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @celtic_traveler She didn't say she wouldn't vote for Biden. She's voting anti-Trump down the ticket then pulling away to form a people's party. Is there something wrong with that. I thought the DNC didn't like progressives?
1303818703830736896 2020-09-10 06:12:57 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @LarryWoolfolk2 Stormy Daniels deserves hazard pay AND trauma therapy for that legit work. There are so many women you couldn't pay to fuck that dude yet women keep finding a price point to match with stolen money. Without inequitable capitalist markets a lot of fascists wouldn't ever procreate.
1303817378195795970 2020-09-10 06:07:41 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Um...Susan Sarandon is fighting Soledad O'Brien on Twitter.  These is the end times ya'll.
1303815423088037890 2020-09-10 05:59:55 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Lie to Congress, fuck over soldiers, steal elections. It's like Trump is desperately trying his absolute hardest to convince the world that white privilege doesn't exist by showing how much he literally has.  This is the most fascist shit I've ever seen this side of the Rio Klan.
1303814447543332871 2020-09-10 05:56:02 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Fuck no.  That's it.  That's the whole unadulterated tweet.
1303814143531720704 2020-09-10 05:54:50 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Ask a fascist if they would cover Obama's rape defense today!
1303812458918883328 2020-09-10 05:48:08 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Why isn't an adult using their body as a commodity for their own agency in the sex industry considered a "real job?" They have expenses, job hazards and regularly violated worker's rights because of quality regulation deficit.  The patriarchy keeps prices low via delegitimizing.
1303773555134533633 2020-09-10 03:13:33 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Republicans in 1998 - OMFG Clinton had consensual sex with a Whitehouse intern! The DNA is right here on this dress!  Republicans in 2020 - Rape is Trump's presidential duty and we should use taxpayer dollars to fight releasing DNA evidence that could exonerate him immediately.
1303770639413710848 2020-09-10 03:01:57 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The semantics that fascists use to avoid calling this treason is that we currently aren't in a state of formal war with Russia...while our elections are under attack.
1303769532927012866 2020-09-10 02:57:34 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> If #COVID was truly China's fault and China's fault alone, why did Trump lie to the public about the severity of it?  It's almost like the blame was shifted AFTER the fact when accountability for 190,000 dead Americans was pushed to the forefront. 🤔
1303491318136659971 2020-09-09 08:32:02 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @CorazzaModern Yes.
1303468992393359367 2020-09-09 07:03:19 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Progressives in #NorthCarolina stand up!
1303464811380998144 2020-09-09 06:46:42 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> All gave some...some were just suckers and losers.  - #Trump2020
1303463875396939779 2020-09-09 06:42:59 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Apparently the problem with the "suckers and losers" in the military is that they don't sex traffick enough children for Trump to wish them well.
1303461663388172289 2020-09-09 06:34:12 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @MEGA4NC She has a point tho. Too many people think Democracy is on autopilot and we just sit back and talk shit. That's literally how we got Trump.
1303461118967414784 2020-09-09 06:32:02 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> People are only valued as chattel to the wealthy.  American slavery teaches us that. The false construct of race simply deludes most into thinking it can't be them.
1303460087722369031 2020-09-09 06:27:56 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Now you see why Trump doesn't give a damn about Marines having Russian bounties on their heads. The fascist sees them as disposable losers who shouldn't have been suckers enough to get killed anyway. All fascists think of life like this then disingenuously hide behind the unborn.
1303424121037033473 2020-09-09 04:05:01 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @dazzlingblu @OprahWinfairy @ProudSocialist Got 'em
1303279507525251072 2020-09-08 18:30:23 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Fascists are always "proud" to be afraid of letting people hear their bigoted views in any way that makes them suffer the consequences.
1303082896937418754 2020-09-08 05:29:07 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Republicans be like: If Jeff Bezos doesn't stop being a capitalist we worship and pay more to use this post office we're making DeJoy destroy this isn't the America so many suckers and losers fought and died for and I'm voting all these politicians out in the next rigged election
1302902247567831041 2020-09-07 17:31:17 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @ismellskunk @ResisterDude @DavidCornDC Nice.
1302463983996342273 2020-09-06 12:29:47 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> We are getting closer and closer to that day when Trump drops the n-bomb and all the racists go wild because they don't have to deflect and pretend anymore that they haven't been racists this whole time aren't we?
1302459344345354242 2020-09-06 12:11:20 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Wait wait wait. This dumbass hired an Obama impersonator just so he could ceremoniously fire him.  Junior high cheerleaders on social media aren't obsessed with being this dramatically petty.
1302431747251023872 2020-09-06 10:21:41 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Along with saying fuck trump with vigor, I'm focusing on using my bit of influence in these social media streets to get these local fascists out of office. I interviewed @jennawadsworth last night for the show Tuesday and she's so impressive I'm totally down with the #WadSquad.
1302428581646266369 2020-09-06 10:09:06 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Funny how every NC fascist from @SteveTroxlerNC to @SenBurr to spineless @SenThomTillis refuses to denounce @realDonaldTrump for calling veterans in NC who sacrificed their lives, "losers."  I guess when it comes to supporting our troops they can't see @DanForestNC for the trees.
1302260456724353024 2020-09-05 23:01:02 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Don't forget to ask a Trump supporting veteran if they're a loser or a sucker today!
1301637282080882689 2020-09-04 05:44:45 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @LangerMargret There is no easy button. This path will require mobilization, organisation and discipline to work. I don't understand how Leftists who didn't possess enough of these to mobilize nationally in 2016 and 2018 to take Congress and the presidency think it can magically happen now.
1301620343182852096 2020-09-04 04:37:27 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Progressives can make demands for the future if we acknowledge this reality, continue to build on momentum and vote Biden now to elect more progressives in 2022 for a breakaway if defined demands aren't met by 2024. We cannot take this strategy under a fascist 2nd Trump term. 2/2
1301620342235029506 2020-09-04 04:37:27 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The sobering reality is that if Biden loses he and his donors will be just as fine as Hillary and her donors are right now. They answer to the wealthy who will work with the empowered fascists. The far left has no leverage to negotiate with currently for demanding absolutes. 1/2
1301603274148241414 2020-09-04 03:29:37 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @ElleWibble When you speak truth they can't.
1301533299622453250 2020-09-03 22:51:34 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> If what I say and how I say it disturbs you more than the fact that smarter more successful people than me agree with my methodology, you might need to reflect. I'm public purposefully. Public opinion can be a force for good if used to find the truth. This is why we have the law.
1301527296294236168 2020-09-03 22:27:43 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Jacob Blake was shot in the back under the SUSPICION that he MIGHT have a weapon in his van. Trump LITERALLY broke the law in front of the police on national television by telling people to vote twice and the only way you don't see this shit by now is if your MAGA hat is too low.
1301513353530159105 2020-09-03 21:32:19 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> It should be glaringly apparent by now to anyone paying attention that Republicans packed the courts with judges to protect law enforcement from facing consequences for killing the poor before they get a chance to see one themselves.
1301473002144641024 2020-09-03 18:51:58 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The main reason you can't use Trump's own words against him is because his words don't mean anything and are never meant to mean anything. Their sole intent is manipulating the recipient of the message into doing whatever Trump wants for more power. All fascists operate this way.
1301469931809255425 2020-09-03 18:39:46 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The sitting president of the united states literally told his followers to commit voter fraud to "test the system" and BREAK STATE AND FEDERAL LAW and the top law enforcement official of the country was like..."Meh."
1301463512993198081 2020-09-03 18:14:16 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @What_Name_____ Trump is legally committing genocide according to international law and has been even before COVID when he approved removing parents from their children and deporting them. This is accurate.
1301365253016518656 2020-09-03 11:43:49 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Pop Quiz: You have two candidates for president. One is actively committing genocide. The other isn't. Who do you vote for?  Take all the time you need...
1301362599519453184 2020-09-03 11:33:16 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Corporatism is the fascism precursor. Trump's methodology due to the inability to privatize public assets like the Nazis is simply to break them by handing them over to fascist capitalists to mismanage into the ground while they profit off the devastation in the private sector.
1301359659199102977 2020-09-03 11:21:35 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @AOC Love you Alex. From the bottom of heart keep fighting.
1301331479553814532 2020-09-03 09:29:36 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> It's actually pretty exhausting being a Trump cultist. You wake up every day hoping that today's the day he's gonna to fix it all and prove the libtards wrong but he ends up confirming their predictions so you pour a warm cup of glue and photoshop dicks onto Michelle Obama memes.
1301306862416072704 2020-09-03 07:51:47 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Fascists keep dressing as protesters to foment violence and provoke more Killer Kyle Kenosha encounters. How many of their scary BLM and antifa bogeyman have been caught dressing as racist militias, MAGAts and law enforcement?   https://t.co/CJGhV40eyw
1301303607954993153 2020-09-03 07:38:51 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @oldnewnurse @JFlambouis Won't be coming. Her trolling stopped the moment she couldn't refute the fascist genocide. They ALL stop when you bring up the genocide. There's no argument that's an equivalent including their abortion boogeyman ghost.  Dems should frame the dialogue like that and keep it there.
1301183577951031296 2020-09-02 23:41:54 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @oldnewnurse @JFlambouis It is. Not enough faces of color speaking out yet but I'm hoping we can get there with this current moment calling attention to mental health issues.
1301167759523565569 2020-09-02 22:39:03 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @oldnewnurse @JFlambouis The genocidal fascist blocked me @oldnewnurse. Curious to see how they respond to you. Thanks for the backup.
1301166260068249603 2020-09-02 22:33:05 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @JFlambouis @oldnewnurse Exactly. I don't know why you thought you could defend fascist genocide to begin with. Didn't work for the Nazis. Wont work for fuckwit fascist MAGAts either but you're trying...desperately and stupidly.
1301165958783000583 2020-09-02 22:31:53 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @JFlambouis @oldnewnurse It's still international law and still genocide regardless of the supposed convenience. I didn't make that law. It existed before Trump started his genocide and you supported it because you excuse killing fetuses AND their mothers.
1301165134732095492 2020-09-02 22:28:37 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @JFlambouis @oldnewnurse Whataboutism doesn't stop.the genocide you're endorsing that's happening right now. You're just rationalizing your current support of evil by deflecting to your selective opinion of evil the past. Congrats, it's still evil, fascist.
1301164715272474624 2020-09-02 22:26:57 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @JFlambouis @oldnewnurse No you're just genocidal and valuing property over actual lives while pretending to care about fetuses but endorsing sending children to die in classrooms like a fascist hypocrite.
1301164287524831236 2020-09-02 22:25:15 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @JFlambouis @oldnewnurse Try as you will, nonsensical and sadistic false equivalenciess still don't make abortion genocide according to international law. Deporting children without their parents IS recognized as genocide. Democrats have never done that as policy. Republicans are.  Try again.
1301162141022662657 2020-09-02 22:16:43 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @JFlambouis @oldnewnurse Abortion doesn't kill living viable human beings and is not recognized under international law as genocide. What the Republicans are doing right now with migrants and selective refusal to address COVID is. Stop making false equivalence to rationalize your sadism.
1301158494339563521 2020-09-02 22:02:14 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @JFlambouis @oldnewnurse Fascists utilize political power to subvert the law. The Democrats don't have the political power otherwise Trump would be gone. The Democrats aren't currently conducting genocide, Republicans are.
1301150887235198976 2020-09-02 21:32:00 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @JFlambouis @oldnewnurse You still haven't given credentials about how you're "in medicine."
1301135479086219265 2020-09-02 20:30:46 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> If you're the kind of fascist that thinks Democrat run cities are sh*tholes I'd suggest you sit down before I tell you about Republican run states but that would be pointless...  Fascists don't stand for anything unless it's an empty opportunity to f*ck a flag.
1301123642680541184 2020-09-02 19:43:44 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @Momof461187240 It's 2020. That's Satan laughing in the clouds for sure.
1301123373246951424 2020-09-02 19:42:40 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> White supremacists infiltrate protests and agitate under disguise to escalate situations. If riots are happening naturally why do they need to provoke them?  https://t.co/NXq4aiagk5
1301120265909305344 2020-09-02 19:30:19 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Read ALL of this...
1301119046235103233 2020-09-02 19:25:28 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @oldnewnurse @JFlambouis To a fascist, the number of deaths is never too high to achieve the goal of invalidating life.
1300983509230718978 2020-09-02 10:26:54 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @JFlambouis @oldnewnurse Florida is COVID outbreak central. Nice try though.
1300983393719652354 2020-09-02 10:26:26 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @JFlambouis @oldnewnurse I'm saying California accepts assistance as does every state but it doesn't need it. All the welfare queen states are Republican.  Highest poverty and lowest education rates are Republican states too. States are bigger than cities last time I checked. 😂🤣😂
1300973731142139904 2020-09-02 09:48:03 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @JFlambouis @oldnewnurse California has a greater GDP than some countries. Meanwhile show me Republican stares that are thriving without government assistance? 😂🤣😂
1300961891335000069 2020-09-02 09:01:00 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> For the people who want to know what I sound like? This is what I sound like...yes I'm loud...and kinda pissed but mostly loud.
1300961027190915074 2020-09-02 08:57:34 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @JFlambouis @oldnewnurse How many minority representatives are in the Republican party versus the Democrats again? Both sides aren't the same. Nice try though.
1300932165656612864 2020-09-02 07:02:53 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Kyle Rittenhouse is just one of the murderhole tourists. TONIGHT at 7pm Eastern: J Brandon Johnson welcomes Se7eN from #KansasCity’s “KC InfoRail” to discuss LIVE.  Join the convo &amp; here to talk about what #fascism is up to.
1300912187855245312 2020-09-02 05:43:30 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @GenZResister @suzyq8825 My post was anti-Trump also...
1300909592499630080 2020-09-02 05:33:11 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> @GenZResister @suzyq8825 Ditto.
1300814384894283780 2020-09-01 23:14:51 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The Russians have leaked the personal information of 8 MILLION Americans. This is what happens when you support a fascist so much that you don't care if they don't protect elections. Want info to target Dems to intimidate? Now you have it. This is fascism.  https://t.co/3b0VG0PlKW
1300804993168166912 2020-09-01 22:37:32 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Climate science deniers are literally killing a potential cure for cancer as bee populations are collapsing.  https://t.co/tnG3VIff73
1300777137885118465 2020-09-01 20:46:51 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> So I'm gonna be live tonight...let's talk.
1300767558191271938 2020-09-01 20:08:47 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> Happy birthday to my oldest @H4ppy_01. Love you.  Stay smart and stay safe.
1300765775372918789 2020-09-01 20:01:42 +0800 <johnsonjoeb> The black bourgeoisie strikes again.
