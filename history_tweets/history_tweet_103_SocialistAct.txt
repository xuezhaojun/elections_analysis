1343978883033554944 2020-12-30 01:55:10 +0800 <SocialistAct> There is no prospect of No Deal, so this is false  It is delusional believe this deal with bring stability - only misery
1343976328891146242 2020-12-30 01:45:01 +0800 <SocialistAct> Labour MPs must ignore Keir Starmer and vote against this rotten Tory Brexit deal   'It will leave Britons worse off in every way' - @Manuel_TSSA is right    https://t.co/PEZ7aKrrHr
1343973895532109824 2020-12-30 01:35:21 +0800 <SocialistAct> Would have to admit all previous policy was wrong  Would have to put people before profits  Meanwhile cases, hospitalisations and deaths soar  #ZeroCovid

1343971414123098114 2020-12-30 01:25:29 +0800 <SocialistAct> Starmer himself says this is a terrible deal - and then demands Labour MPs vote for it  Labour cannot recover in Scotland after voting for this - which means forming a govt is ruled out  The dissastisfaction with the consequences of this deal will go to SNP and LDEMs- not Labour
1343970462410399745 2020-12-30 01:21:42 +0800 <SocialistAct> Completely false argument that voting against Johnson's terrible deal is the same as voting for No Deal  This is the Tory government's deal - they won't even allow any amendments to their resolution in favour of it  No Deal is ruled out. Labour should not vote for this deal
1343969124121268224 2020-12-30 01:16:23 +0800 <SocialistAct> Of course all MPs including Labour MPs will be responsible for the terrible consequences of Johnson's Brexit deal if they vote for it  Anything else is simply MPs' special pleading not to be held accountable for their own actions

1343850206522187776 2020-12-29 17:23:51 +0800 <SocialistAct> Unfortunately this is wrong  Corbyn is right to be a genuine internationalist  We all live in the US Empire. That is why Brexit is done, why Johnson is PM, why opposition to Corbyn was ferocious, why £24bn extra is being spent on military, etc  Internationalism is self-interest
1343847450344378369 2020-12-29 17:12:54 +0800 <SocialistAct> Unfortunately, both were a foregone conclusion
1343845289929678849 2020-12-29 17:04:19 +0800 <SocialistAct> Claim that a vote against Johnson's terrible deal is same as voting for No Deal is completely false  If the govt brings a law restoring the death penalty you aren't voting for stoning to death if you vote against hanging  Johnson's deal is hugely damaging - and should be opposed
1343841987385057280 2020-12-29 16:51:11 +0800 <SocialistAct> Labour MPs should not vote for the Tories' Hard Brexit tomorrow!  - Campaign for Labour Party Democracy encouraging local Labour Parties to tell Labour MPs they should not to help the Tories.  (See the motion)

1343827715728797697 2020-12-29 15:54:29 +0800 <SocialistAct> £24 billion extra for the military has nothing to do with protecting Britons - the govt clearly doesn't care about that  The military budget is put in the service of the US, and its aggression around the globe, enforcing its illegal sanctions and its Cold War against China
1343826009116860416 2020-12-29 15:47:42 +0800 <SocialistAct> Very unusual - factual article in the Guardian acknowledging that Western countries should have learnt from Eastern ones  The UK and the US need to learn from countries that better handled Covid-19 - which means China, Viet Nam, NZ, Australia, Thailand   https://t.co/M7RxImnGJG

1343479865589329926 2020-12-28 16:52:15 +0800 <SocialistAct> Starmer voting for the Tory/US Brexit deal means he is siding with:  A declining minority of Leavers (40% vs 51% for Remain) A tiny minority pf Labour supporters (12% vs 88%) A project to attack living standards   https://t.co/4pju8kNvI2
1343478242137821184 2020-12-28 16:45:48 +0800 <SocialistAct> A large majority of people support another national lockdown  What is missing is the political will  #ZeroCovid strategy needed now!
1343477860284174336 2020-12-28 16:44:17 +0800 <SocialistAct> The scandal of how the students are being treated is overwhelmingly the government's fault
1343474979350970368 2020-12-28 16:32:50 +0800 <SocialistAct> The 'stimulus checks' to households cost substantially less than the bail-outs for big business, including oil, pharma and defense contractors  Yet Larry Summers doesn't believe these would be inflationary  Because the whole of mainstream economics is to justify those bail-outs
1343162244943720449 2020-12-27 19:50:08 +0800 <SocialistAct> Truth is that Chinese authorities treats the entire population far better than the British authorities treat British people
1343137485535272961 2020-12-27 18:11:45 +0800 <SocialistAct> As usual, pure BS from the Mail  Piece says 600,000 vaccinations, not 'nearly a million'  Whole population needs to be vaccinated, up to 130 million jabs in total  At current rate means this would take 6 years  https://t.co/Gr5JGzZXvX
1343133744807505920 2020-12-27 17:56:53 +0800 <SocialistAct> A proper lockdown is needed, closing all non-essential workplaces, schools, colleges &amp; universities to shift to remote learning  Proper testing, tracing and supported isolation to be put in place - it still isn't  #ZeroCovid
1343132504375619586 2020-12-27 17:51:57 +0800 <SocialistAct> The ridiculous Western smear of uninhabited 'ghost cities' are simply the temporary effect of urban planning including planned housing development, not the chaos of relying solely on the market
1343120739277414400 2020-12-27 17:05:12 +0800 <SocialistAct> By the time the Tories have lowered workers' rights, reduced environmental protections and generally Amercianised British society it will be more like losing 20 quid then losing 50 quid

1342142093582622723 2020-12-25 00:16:25 +0800 <SocialistAct> This deal will damage the interests of the vast majority of people in this country  Not a single one of Starmer's six tests have been met   Do Starmer's pledges mean anything, or are they all just words to benefit him personally?   https://t.co/8g44RPSKLA

1340961547515031552 2020-12-21 18:05:21 +0800 <SocialistAct> Maybe continuously and prominently report from the countries that have succesfully combatted the virus?  Just an idea
1340951829325246464 2020-12-21 17:26:44 +0800 <SocialistAct> This govt failure was almost certainly a factor in the renewed upsurge in cases and hospitalisations, and the reason deaths stopped falling even during the last lockdown  Govt lied to students, got their fees and rents from them, then sent them home without any help or testing

1340567073764888577 2020-12-20 15:57:51 +0800 <SocialistAct> British government policy has always been much closer to herd immunity than to eliminating the virus as was done in other countries  (....and before the trolls surface, yes NZ is an island.

1338858754977067008 2020-12-15 22:49:36 +0800 <SocialistAct> Wall Street also donated millions to back Biden for the White House  Because Wall Street wants pro-Wall Street policies  And gridlock on Capitol Hill is welcome  Because it increases the leverage of Wall St and ensures no popular pressure is effective   https://t.co/o6QQW0ywcf
1338829799847030789 2020-12-15 20:54:33 +0800 <SocialistAct> In that time nurses moved from C2 to C1 and B, hundreds of thousands of them.  This is because the minimum qualifications have risen substantially.  Just one example.  Readership survey categories of ABC1C2DE can't tell you anything about class.

1338817317665435648 2020-12-15 20:04:57 +0800 <SocialistAct> Could never happen here  British government would have given the Wirecard fraudsters a multi-billion PPE contract to bail them out
1338816873912266753 2020-12-15 20:03:11 +0800 <SocialistAct> It's the principle that they can force *all* schools to stay open  To keep all their parents/carers in work  It's profits before people
1338815628577271808 2020-12-15 19:58:14 +0800 <SocialistAct> Any infections or deaths are clearly the responsibility of the government

1338794423858188288 2020-12-15 18:33:58 +0800 <SocialistAct> Like a report some time ago, possibly FT, which quoted a dissident, a unnamed cleaner and a US Embassy official in a piece about public opinion in Moscow  #ColdWar journalism
1338793404277338112 2020-12-15 18:29:55 +0800 <SocialistAct> Many individual scientists may be too intimidated to repeat their earlier calls for tougher measures  But two of the leading medical journal are not  The relaxation measures should be cancelled now!  Not the day before.  #ZeroCovid strategy needed
1338783033021894658 2020-12-15 17:48:43 +0800 <SocialistAct> It might be this rubbish, which is essentially a shoddy argument that if new jobs have been created they must be forced labour   https://t.co/5zszqDsMyU
1338760793681260545 2020-12-15 16:20:20 +0800 <SocialistAct> Possibly 'Victims of Communism'?  If so, it's funded by the US Congress.
1338755971888410632 2020-12-15 16:01:11 +0800 <SocialistAct> @SJG99 A US Congress-funded report is released the same day as BBC has major news item across all media  And hours later 3 major retailers announce a boycott   Remarkable international co-operation and speed

1338751605756354560 2020-12-15 15:43:50 +0800 <SocialistAct> BBC reporters' indictment of China consists of the Adrian Zenz report ("these new jobs in Xinjiang could indicate something bad") plus footage of very large factories.   That's it.  Maybe Colin Powell should take it to the UN.
1338750572531511296 2020-12-15 15:39:43 +0800 <SocialistAct> The sole claim for Starmer is that he will get Labour back into government  But the evidence does not point that way at all
1338748480341352450 2020-12-15 15:31:25 +0800 <SocialistAct> Hancock implies the rise is new cases is due to the new strain - but with no evidence  The British press dutifully peddles this claim  The rise in cases was predicted - and comes from easing weak restrictions even further when cases were still at 14,000 a day  https://t.co/AEOYcF3dEU
1338606412671356928 2020-12-15 06:06:53 +0800 <SocialistAct> One of the Brexit myths is that leaving would mean far fewer rules  It clearly won't   Just far worse rules, on workers' rights, environmental protections and product standards
1338603863151161344 2020-12-15 05:56:45 +0800 <SocialistAct> No 'human rights' issues at all  Just straight forward attack for commercial/strategic reasons  But this is what the Empire does
1338601474633441280 2020-12-15 05:47:16 +0800 <SocialistAct> Because the Tories forcing you to go to work is more important than keeping your children safe
1338546437387378694 2020-12-15 02:08:34 +0800 <SocialistAct> This is the right move. It will save lives.  Other councils should follow suit.
1338526810485747718 2020-12-15 00:50:34 +0800 <SocialistAct> With this policy from the Labour front bench, one of the first things to close will be the hospitals
1338481903993835523 2020-12-14 21:52:08 +0800 <SocialistAct> Just as the large majority of voters turn against Brexit   Starmer wants Labour to embrace Johnson's disastrous Brexit    https://t.co/NWH07ATlVT

1338462483468709888 2020-12-14 20:34:58 +0800 <SocialistAct> Lateral flow testing doesn't work - as shown in Liverpool  They're both wrong - the schools should close!
1338462207445782528 2020-12-14 20:33:52 +0800 <SocialistAct> Johnson is gambling with people's lives.  And losing  #ZeroCovid  needed
1338457837144518657 2020-12-14 20:16:30 +0800 <SocialistAct> Close the schools!

1338392864955445248 2020-12-14 15:58:19 +0800 <SocialistAct> Guardian always promotes a 'progressive alliance' - a non-progressive alliance of the Labour right and the LDEMs  Just like Blair &amp; Mandelson they believe Labour separating itself from the Liberals was a strategic mistake  They want to kill off the left   https://t.co/pi3HpNzxdS
1338391768589627392 2020-12-14 15:53:58 +0800 <SocialistAct> Schools are a key transmission area for infections  Schools in London should be shut  Schools across the country should be shut    https://t.co/bLkf3kG8Le
1338248239980613634 2020-12-14 06:23:38 +0800 <SocialistAct> Germany was obliged to own up to horrific crimes and clear out the Nazis because it was the Red Army that fought it's way to Berlin  But the US dropped nuclear  bombs on  Japan - and kept all the old fascists and militarist in place
1338122210003783692 2020-12-13 22:02:50 +0800 <SocialistAct> The government knows that schools are focal point of high transmission levels  But are forcing schools to stay open, and force children to go to school  Not private school children, just your kids
1338120998877622272 2020-12-13 21:58:01 +0800 <SocialistAct> Vaccines are not a magic bullet  They are a very important part of a #ZeroCovid strategy
1338120429345574914 2020-12-13 21:55:46 +0800 <SocialistAct> When a thin deal or No Deal is finally agreed, Johnson so ill-prepared yet another extension is possible  The long-term aim is clear though - the Americanisation of British labour laws and conditions (not its pay), its environmental and product standards   https://t.co/RepzJsrLPR

1338050357780426754 2020-12-13 17:17:19 +0800 <SocialistAct> Sorry, Deborah.  But that is the history of the last 500 years of this country.  It was disguting when Britain sent naval forces around the world to plunder and pillage  It's farcical to believe for ministers to believe they can still do this - when the US will tell them to stop
1337876534556831744 2020-12-13 05:46:37 +0800 <SocialistAct> Close the schools!
1337805488508039171 2020-12-13 01:04:18 +0800 <SocialistAct> 7-day moving average is 24% higher than a week ago, 50% higher than the low-point of 14,400  The fall in cases is definitely over and there is a risk the renewed upturn has already begun  We need a #ZeroCovid policy
1337731306751406083 2020-12-12 20:09:32 +0800 <SocialistAct> Yes, still doing it all the time  List has broadened to Muslims, Black people, China, Iran, and not forgetting, Corbyn

1337675305155239936 2020-12-12 16:27:00 +0800 <SocialistAct> "Everything to stop the spread in school-age children"  Means closing the schools
1337674661673512962 2020-12-12 16:24:26 +0800 <SocialistAct> Yes.  And 'Lord' Patten made it clear: HK, Tibet, Uyghurs, Belt and Road debt etc, etc are part of an all-around anti-China propaganda campaign    The colonialists and imperialists are in a frenzy because China is pulling way ahead economically of the crisis-hit Western powers
1337670063097262080 2020-12-12 16:06:10 +0800 <SocialistAct> BBC 'debates' China with 2 rabidly anti-China figures   The former colonial governor says China will never be so important again as it is now - so UK can 'stand up to them'   In fact countries like China and India were large part of world GDP before UK invaded - And can be again
1337459529508917251 2020-12-12 02:09:35 +0800 <SocialistAct> No.  So, just as well Starmer has opposed him on every decisive question, otherwise he would be morally responsible too
1337458077587689472 2020-12-12 02:03:49 +0800 <SocialistAct> Johnson is like the First World War politicians who promised 'a land fit for heroes' while they carried on the carnage  They were lying too
1337456104842940421 2020-12-12 01:55:58 +0800 <SocialistAct> 100%
1337453349390741504 2020-12-12 01:45:01 +0800 <SocialistAct> International Criminal Court has just been asked to rule on claims of 'genocide' of Uighurs.  They found no evidence.  So the 'activist' is hurt for no reason  Or simply wants sanctions against China irrespective of any evidence
1337451179287191552 2020-12-12 01:36:24 +0800 <SocialistAct> Agreed.  Death penalty is inexcusable, whoever being punished  But these cases highlight the complete inequality in the 'justice' system for Black prisoners

1337372033634721793 2020-12-11 20:21:54 +0800 <SocialistAct> In many US States the cops are out in force on polling day, to stop Black people voting  They still do it.  And now the *elected Governors* in some of those States file law suits to have the votes thrown out  The US is not a democracy
1337333740729757699 2020-12-11 17:49:44 +0800 <SocialistAct> Remember how the Western press told us there was a new, reforming leader in Saudi Arabia?  Even as Mahammed bin Salman was keeping migrants in modern slavery, jailing activists, chopping up opponents and bombing Yemeni civilians.  But then, he does buy a lot of US/UK/French arms
1337308627863040001 2020-12-11 16:09:57 +0800 <SocialistAct> Conditions at Brook House are already grotesque  Now the government is risking serious illness or death by detaining people people *who are guilty of nothing*   Vile policy. Vile government   https://t.co/AvX08GhJho

1337305536069578752 2020-12-11 15:57:40 +0800 <SocialistAct> Bill Clinton ordered the execution of a Black man, Rick Ray Rector in order to win the White House  Trump ordered the execution of another Black man, Brandon Bernard even though he has to leave the White House, just to please his base  Even lower than Clinton is some legacy

1337303819508707328 2020-12-11 15:50:51 +0800 <SocialistAct> The broad #BlackLivesMatter   movement won the election for Biden - it was far more popular than him and most voters who supported voted Biden  But Biden has no interest in modern civil rights or combatting racism
1337144735413260288 2020-12-11 05:18:42 +0800 <SocialistAct> The NED is just the CIA rebranded  Western leftists need to be very, very wary of repeating the lies of outfits on the NED payroll
1337135919611207684 2020-12-11 04:43:40 +0800 <SocialistAct> This is spot on  The main dividing line in British politics was for or against Corbyn  Tories, their media, LibDems, Labour right and others all understood this - and prioritised stopping Corbyn
1337131727924420609 2020-12-11 04:27:01 +0800 <SocialistAct> Keeping London in Tier 2 means the government doesn't give a damn about the health of Londoners either

1337126207641374720 2020-12-11 04:05:05 +0800 <SocialistAct> Because the BBCs job is to uphold the status quo - as an arm of the State  But it's the government itself tearing down the status quo and creating chaos   So, for a moment, disarray at the BBC means they might report some news  Before returning to support the govt soon
1337103201447911429 2020-12-11 02:33:40 +0800 <SocialistAct> Johnson &amp; co have got away with presiding over 75,000 deaths and a huge economic slump  So paying a political price for the Brexit disaster is not inevitable  Because the mass of the population would also need to see there is an alternative  They look to Starmer...and see none
1337101080107343877 2020-12-11 02:25:14 +0800 <SocialistAct> The herd immunity, neoliberal cranks got their way in Sweden  You don't need lockdowns, they said.  It's only a flu, they said.  Look at Sweden, they said  Yes, look and weep  #ZeroCovid now!  https://t.co/K8qmkqNwuL

1337013834331119617 2020-12-10 20:38:33 +0800 <SocialistAct> If the police forces in Greater Manchester and in West Midlands and in London spent less time swamping #BlackLivesMatter protests and conducting racist stop and search policies  Then their record on preventing or detecting actual crime might improve

1336999257820295170 2020-12-10 19:40:37 +0800 <SocialistAct> Bolsonaro is not concerned with inflation, hunger or unemployment. It does not even deal with the pandemic, in ensuring the vaccine reaches the Brazilians. But he announced that he will put zero taxes on imports of revolvers and pistols. He is the president of violence and death
1336995228696326144 2020-12-10 19:24:37 +0800 <SocialistAct> This is already signed by almost 30% of CLPs  Many more can join!
1336986014959755271 2020-12-10 18:48:00 +0800 <SocialistAct> Brilliant fight!  Brilliant victory!  Fantastic for the fighting workers @GreatOrmondSt !  If you fight, sometimes you will lose.  But you can never win if you don't fight.  This is fighting and winning!

1336977307429441538 2020-12-10 18:13:24 +0800 <SocialistAct> They are protesting racism  They are not protesting the minimum wage  Racism permeates the whole of British society, and footballers are among all the Black and Asian people who face it, no matter what they are paid  #BlackLivesMatter
1336948132362510337 2020-12-10 16:17:28 +0800 <SocialistAct> US new cases are spreading like wildfire - 200,000 a day  Thanksgiving was clearly an accelerant  Cannot get virus under control without proper lockdown, testing, tracing and isolation.  Full financial support for workers and the poor needed.  #ZeroCovid  https://t.co/w995ebJGL0
1336945872173735938 2020-12-10 16:08:29 +0800 <SocialistAct> The downtrend in new cases already appears to have ended  There are worrying signs that new cases could already be rising  #ZeroCovid strategy is needed  https://t.co/hHBuKV82I0
1336944721214775301 2020-12-10 16:03:55 +0800 <SocialistAct> Racism permeates every aspect of British society
1336800121422565376 2020-12-10 06:29:20 +0800 <SocialistAct> But the "Muslim travel ban" gives the US authority to speak?
1336797429509853185 2020-12-10 06:18:38 +0800 <SocialistAct> Democratic Party leadership is successfully bipartisan in preventing overseas troop withdrawals  Also successfully bipartisan in preventing support for workers  Guns not butter under Trump or Biden    https://t.co/LgrcrJ2ORS via @CBSPolitics
1336796472969465857 2020-12-10 06:14:50 +0800 <SocialistAct> It's not 'in the public interest' to prosecute the people who toppled the Colston statue  Toppling the statue of a slave trader is in the public interest   https://t.co/FlllQkyuVO
1336715439905320961 2020-12-10 00:52:50 +0800 <SocialistAct> "Which is we we are using sanctions, trade wars and aircraft carriers, because these people are no threat to us"
1336711350928732161 2020-12-10 00:36:35 +0800 <SocialistAct> You can only express solidarity if you're on the minimum wage?  Limits the appeal of solidarity, or socialism a little bit
1336662065445019649 2020-12-09 21:20:45 +0800 <SocialistAct> Anti-colonial revolutions are not always successful, unfortunately  When the counter-revolution wins out, the rulers are paranoid at every expression of nationalism or independence, however light-hearted    https://t.co/55TGK4kBGs
1336650346265972738 2020-12-09 20:34:10 +0800 <SocialistAct> The call to leave Labour 'in solidarity with Jeremy' is foolish  If in an industrial dispute, workers at a plant are locked-out  It is not solidarity for workers at other plants to just quit  #ReinstateJeremyCorbyn
1336649421426135045 2020-12-09 20:30:30 +0800 <SocialistAct> We've seen the figures. 75,000 dead and rising.  You are confusing the necessary lockdown with government failures to make lockdown work and liveable  Because the govt refuses to do that, you want to let the virus rip  This is the policy of Cummings &amp; the Telegraph   Terrible
1336647995077644289 2020-12-09 20:24:50 +0800 <SocialistAct> Food retailers now say that disruption to supplies because of Brexit is now unavoidable   https://t.co/VJw9w5MCeU
1336637358381424642 2020-12-09 19:42:34 +0800 <SocialistAct> He was introduced as someone who knows a lot about the fishing industry, for family reasons  He lied about that too   https://t.co/RyPGx2sSqr
1336636191937093633 2020-12-09 19:37:56 +0800 <SocialistAct> Brexit will lead to huge job losses  It is a completely anti-worker project
1336626538054299649 2020-12-09 18:59:34 +0800 <SocialistAct> The same reactionary government who let the virus rip  Is also denying full support for lockdown, which should be 100% of wages  But it really isn't anti-capitalist to let the virus rip  The huge job losses are a result of both these failures, on public health &amp; on jobs and pay
1336623373737189376 2020-12-09 18:47:00 +0800 <SocialistAct> The Global South and China are the main forces of progressive world development   https://t.co/wCEvw2yn7k  https://t.co/PSAkXCr7IN

1336599460957261824 2020-12-09 17:11:58 +0800 <SocialistAct> The deaths are real
1336584674290831360 2020-12-09 16:13:13 +0800 <SocialistAct> Meaning businesses in Britain will not have 'the best of both worlds'  (This is also a lie.  Having a new trade border between any part of Ireland and Britiain is damaging, just less damaging than a hard trade border in Ireland)
1336583590965075968 2020-12-09 16:08:55 +0800 <SocialistAct> This is dishonest.  Ministers know that schools are the key source of new infections.  This is not an inset day. It's token damage limitation day   https://t.co/dhgvVgjBRl
1336581761594167296 2020-12-09 16:01:39 +0800 <SocialistAct> Trump doesn't even believe in the efficacy of vaccines  He just doesn't want non-white nations to gain access to them
1336581376632631303 2020-12-09 16:00:07 +0800 <SocialistAct> Western imperialist countries wonder why they are rapidly losing support and allies in the developing world  Digusting   https://t.co/UBV2ieV1k5
1336578353122435072 2020-12-09 15:48:06 +0800 <SocialistAct> When there are huge job losses because of Brexit, it will be vital to pin the blame where it belongs  Not on Muslims, or Black people, or migrants, or refugees, or Jews, or disabled people, or the Irish, or Brussels, or foreigners  But on Brexiteers    https://t.co/ZhOKMAotR5
1336571647751557124 2020-12-09 15:21:27 +0800 <SocialistAct> Brexit has always been a big business racket for lower standards, lower rules, lower protections and lower wages  But the billionaires who back it put their need for EU market access first   https://t.co/Jv5zaAMpS1
1336432525821030400 2020-12-09 06:08:38 +0800 <SocialistAct> #ZeroCovid is real  #ZeroCovid is achievable
1336346225478692876 2020-12-09 00:25:42 +0800 <SocialistAct> Close the schools!
1336323054134161412 2020-12-08 22:53:38 +0800 <SocialistAct> @Alski74 Very refreshing to be able to disuss with other comrades without rhetoric or acrimony  You are right, many outlets appear more liberal during prosperity.  But as the crisis deepens, they tend to reveal their fundamental character
1336317441954127873 2020-12-08 22:31:20 +0800 <SocialistAct> The 'we hold all the cards' Brexiteers have lied and created fantasies all the way through the process  With a few seconds to midnight reality begins to intervene  There will be no Brexit triumph just one version of calamity or another   https://t.co/z7Z2DceC5g
1336313465837920258 2020-12-08 22:15:32 +0800 <SocialistAct> It's only right that the north of Ireland remains in the Single Market  It's what the people of Ireland voted for and avoids an even greater level of economic damage than for Britain  But there will be damage - and crucial to off-setting that will be the reunification of Ireland
1336286142967279618 2020-12-08 20:26:58 +0800 <SocialistAct> This is not an accident  Government policy is to drive down wages and keep them there through mass unemployment    https://t.co/2p1dxA8KxW

1336226139413635073 2020-12-08 16:28:32 +0800 <SocialistAct> It's true that the EU allows huge subsidies to businesses  Which means that it is a complete fiction that the EU bans state aid by its Members - despite repeated Brexiteer claims
1336224893281644546 2020-12-08 16:23:35 +0800 <SocialistAct> Nothing to do with fighting crime at all  More stop &amp; search, deportations, refugees in barracks, racism-deniers at the EHRC, ignoring Black &amp; Asian Covid deaths...  All part of ruling class 'culture wars', promoting racism to provide scapegoats for their own disastrous policies
1336217860847382529 2020-12-08 15:55:38 +0800 <SocialistAct> Translation from neo-con:  "Maduro clearly won Venezuela elections despite our interventions"
1336003935551754244 2020-12-08 01:45:34 +0800 <SocialistAct> Far too soon to say there's a new trend  But all prior easing of restrictions have led to an upturn in cases  And new cases have now been higher compared to same day of the previous week in 3 out of last 4 days
1335999560624300035 2020-12-08 01:28:11 +0800 <SocialistAct> It's hard to destroy your opponent in debate  When you agree on so much and have no alternative policies on key issues
1335925202400780289 2020-12-07 20:32:43 +0800 <SocialistAct> Remember that time when Margaret Hodge called out Jess Philips and other Labour figures for their abuse of Diane Abbott?  No, no-one does

1335923258743525378 2020-12-07 20:24:59 +0800 <SocialistAct> Western governments opposed to Venezuelan - and their medialike the BBC- claim the opposition was barred from standing  Untrue. They stood &amp; got about 1/3rd of the vote  Their puppet Guaidó did not stand, but this is because he is not even supported by the opposition
1335918761262673926 2020-12-07 20:07:07 +0800 <SocialistAct> Claiming that the government was refering to the Withdrawal Agreement when they said they had 'an oven-ready deal' is a straightforward lie - the WA is not a trade deal  Meanwhile, they have also ripped up the WA anyway by putting forward their Internal Markets Bill
1335860136083136514 2020-12-07 16:14:10 +0800 <SocialistAct> Black and Asian people worst affected by virus   https://t.co/s1MMjkPmdx

1335712574659235843 2020-12-07 06:27:48 +0800 <SocialistAct> You can pretend Covid-19 isn't serious  But the virus takes everyone seriously
1335599719352061952 2020-12-06 22:59:21 +0800 <SocialistAct> So, opposition is possible  Just that it's from the right, complaining about defence cuts when the NHS is on its knees, millions face unemployment and even more face pay cuts  Starmer is not 'continuity Corbynism' and never was
1335595248995733504 2020-12-06 22:41:36 +0800 <SocialistAct> Most of the people claiming BLM = Marxism  Deny racism exists Do not support anti-racism Have never read a work of Marx Won't be honest that they are anti anti-racism, aka racist  #BlackLivesMatter
1335589679115218944 2020-12-06 22:19:28 +0800 <SocialistAct> Australian special forces set out to kill civilians in Afghanistan  Not an isolated incident, but a culture created that led to multiple atrocities  None of the perpetrators or their senior officers face jail  But the brave whistleblower does  The 'morality' of the Empire
1335584844391313409 2020-12-06 22:00:15 +0800 <SocialistAct> 'Managing the US deficit' by invading countries for their oil  When people tell you what they really stand for, believe them, espeially when they are the US President-elect
1335576970059509760 2020-12-06 21:28:58 +0800 <SocialistAct> Brexiteers establishing so much control over the borders  They are going to have two new ones, between the whole of Ireland and Britain and another in Kent  #TakingBackControl
1335575179636957184 2020-12-06 21:21:51 +0800 <SocialistAct> Support the rent strikers!  Students and young people have ripped off, lied to and mistreated - but they are fighting back  Full support for the student rent strike!   https://t.co/MyhGs9SY3w
1335549543639822338 2020-12-06 19:39:59 +0800 <SocialistAct> "Good people on both sides"  No.  They're racists  #BlackLivesMatter

1335525911366688768 2020-12-06 18:06:04 +0800 <SocialistAct> Britain has multiple crises  So the ruling class has launched a huge offensive  Starmer opposes no attack, agrees with most of them  Only the left can offer any opposition, which is why it has been targeted  #ReinstateTheLeft
1335522648940482560 2020-12-06 17:53:06 +0800 <SocialistAct> Not taking the knee or booing those who do   Is an insult to all those who fight racism and the global struggles for equality  It is racist  #BlackLivesMatter
1335521370608955392 2020-12-06 17:48:02 +0800 <SocialistAct> It's actually a product of the (international) socialisation of production
1335520548936441857 2020-12-06 17:44:46 +0800 <SocialistAct> For first time a majority (57%) do not trust government on control of the virus.  Trust in Tories fallen from 69% in April to 38% now  But has no impact on voting intention  Because Starmer has stuck to every calamitous decision from Johnson
1335182471386853376 2020-12-05 19:21:22 +0800 <SocialistAct> What is clear from this article is there is already a debate in US 'conservative' circles about militarily intervening in Taiwan, even though it is part of China  "US Marines were in Taiwan to train their counterparts...for the first time in 4 decades"   https://t.co/CNokBY25e0
1335171881767415808 2020-12-05 18:39:17 +0800 <SocialistAct> Unfortunately, the government or their advisers are well aware of the concentration of infection rate in schools  But they choose to keep them open because they want their parents/carers to be at work - for profits
1335144853680893954 2020-12-05 16:51:53 +0800 <SocialistAct> As Trump took office the US economy was 7% larger than China's (World Bank data, PPPs)  In 2019 it was 8.9% smaller than China's  On World Bank forecasts it will be 16% smaller, on course to widen further in future years  Trump's strategy failed  So, Biden the 'multilateralist'
1335127499169292288 2020-12-05 15:42:55 +0800 <SocialistAct> Macron shutting organisations monitoring breaches of civil rights, inequality &amp; Islamophobia  Johnson appoints people who deny discrimination, racism, Islamophobia exist, or even promote them  This is their response to pandemic and economic slump - vile scapegoating
1334920399851810823 2020-12-05 01:59:59 +0800 <SocialistAct> Send secondary schoolkids home before end of term, says Sage expert  https://t.co/g7sMMutJ7n   Schools should be closed!

1334837789129658372 2020-12-04 20:31:43 +0800 <SocialistAct> Very difficult to wage war on a people unless you have villified them, claimed they are a threat, dehumanised them first  This is why racism is a product of imperialism
1334793010027098112 2020-12-04 17:33:47 +0800 <SocialistAct> The campaign for justice for Pat Finucane and many more will go on   https://t.co/2at0ARDaq0  https://t.co/a8f5I2MJFP

1334769006503489537 2020-12-04 15:58:24 +0800 <SocialistAct> The government's 'priority list' is entirely fake  There are 1.5 million NHS staff alone.

1334583811020120071 2020-12-04 03:42:30 +0800 <SocialistAct> The lie is that Jeremy Corbyn is so offensive to Jewish people that he has to expunged  Then many Jewish people in Labour say they aren't offended by him at all - they agree with Corbyn  So they are expelled
1334582939754127366 2020-12-04 03:39:02 +0800 <SocialistAct> No justice on offer from the British government
1334558311841226756 2020-12-04 02:01:11 +0800 <SocialistAct> Vetoing the US military budget would be the only thing that Trump has ever done to benefit humanity  It would be a very big benefit  So there is zero chance of him sticking to it
1334556766550560769 2020-12-04 01:55:02 +0800 <SocialistAct> .@DiazCanelB on #COVID19 :   We are talking about wars, including unconventional ones; of the use and threat of the use of force and the application of unilateral coercive measures
1334551878957457410 2020-12-04 01:35:37 +0800 <SocialistAct> Government ministers decided they had solved the problem of keeping the Pfizer vaccine at -80 degrees and getting it to care homes  Then reality intervened  Yet they will again get away with peddling these fantasies because of a lapdog press and lapdog Labour leadership

1334548043245477889 2020-12-04 01:20:22 +0800 <SocialistAct> Corbyn rushed to the defence of the Milibands as they came under attack because their father was Jewish and a Marxist  David and Ed Miliband attack Corbyn, presumably because they believe bombing countries and immigration mugs better represent their politics

1334066625172168706 2020-12-02 17:27:23 +0800 <SocialistAct> Macron will not be introducing laws to demonise all Australians in the wake of the scandal  Because the Empire and its allies insist on 'Freedom of Speech' rights only for themselves and their own racism

1329493094698524672 2020-11-20 02:33:49 +0800 <SocialistAct> Some genuine improvement is possibly under way  Likely a reflection of the greater cuation people exercising about work, travel, leisure  But very important to see a very much lower levels of cases, hospitalisations, deaths before any easing of restrictions at all
1329422108808663041 2020-11-19 21:51:44 +0800 <SocialistAct> Labour should not be supporting Tories on military spending too  Can 'left wing commentators' stop claiming the Tories are carrying out Labour's spending plans or the Starmer agrees with Corbynism?

1329114273147129862 2020-11-19 01:28:31 +0800 <SocialistAct> Very true.  The government getting away with millions of redundanacies plus hundreds of deaths per day and starting a civil war are linked
1329112629701447685 2020-11-19 01:21:59 +0800 <SocialistAct> Is your Labour MP, councillor or other elected official on the left?  Maybe even calls themselves a socialist?  But they haven't re/tweeted/said/Facebook posted anything in defence of Corbyn?  Fakers
1329110800183779328 2020-11-19 01:14:43 +0800 <SocialistAct> Jeremy Corbyn has a disciplinary hearing and was readmitted to the Labour Party  Without any new information, action or statement from Corbyn, Starmer took it upon himself to deny membership of the PLP  The former DPP is supposed to know what justice looks like  It's not this
1329109993652695044 2020-11-19 01:11:30 +0800 <SocialistAct> Excellent article from @SpiritofHo   Very timely too
1329107470137094144 2020-11-19 01:01:29 +0800 <SocialistAct> Ridiculous for the Labour right to claim this is about electability  As Blair spelt out, it has nothing to do with winning, he violently opposes Corbyn's anti-war policies  And when Corbyn was suspended Labour's poll rating tanked

1328990130430996486 2020-11-18 17:15:13 +0800 <SocialistAct> Perhaps.  More likely left in CLPs is still too numerous to expel now (as NEC poll shows).  Leadership would probably welcome an exodus of the left.  Can always replace their subs with donors and also then be in complete control.
1328968772032614400 2020-11-18 15:50:20 +0800 <SocialistAct> The reinstatement of Jeremy Corbyn is to put right a serious injustice  But Starmer still intends to crack down on the left - hard   https://t.co/FPgPskkeMk

1328824723007004673 2020-11-18 06:17:56 +0800 <SocialistAct> Why painful, to lift an unjust suspension?  The Jewish community is no less fair minded than any other. There are many enemies of Corbyn, and only they are 'hurt' tby the lifting of his suspension.

1327561851790647297 2020-11-14 18:39:45 +0800 <SocialistAct> Socialists oppose all forms of discrimination, prejudice, racism  Antisemitism &amp; anti-Hindu prejudice are both greater than hostility to Christians in Britain   But by far the most widespread hatred is directed against Muslims  (report from Institute for Jewish Policy Research)  https://t.co/iB4YigHX81
1327319960100757510 2020-11-14 02:38:33 +0800 <SocialistAct> The left has just won more than half (5 out of 9) of the constituency members' seats on Labour's NEC.  Majority of Labour's members still support Corbyn's agenda.   Hence the right-wing leadership's attacks on Corbyn and the members.
1327303322471161858 2020-11-14 01:32:26 +0800 <SocialistAct> The spread of the virus is an issue of class and of race  The virus exposes the huge inequalities and discrimination in this country and deepens them
1327302333269741569 2020-11-14 01:28:30 +0800 <SocialistAct> When Johnson said it would all be over by Xmas, did.....?
1327299895083012096 2020-11-14 01:18:49 +0800 <SocialistAct> How unusual  The government lied, and more people will die as a result  The reason these monumental scandals don't bring the government down is because the Opposition leadership meekly accepts it all   https://t.co/2CWkvEFgCx
1327292193644666880 2020-11-14 00:48:13 +0800 <SocialistAct> Thought Labour leadership was aligning itself with Biden, not Trump?
1327263502847893505 2020-11-13 22:54:13 +0800 <SocialistAct> You won the majority votes of households with over $100,000  You lost the majority of votes of households in all categories below that  A fantasist, like your boss
1327198931399401473 2020-11-13 18:37:38 +0800 <SocialistAct> China is working to expand its ties to Latin America   https://t.co/Skq3wawBeq  https://t.co/pMZeeabBVV

1327161354084552704 2020-11-13 16:08:18 +0800 <SocialistAct> Tomorrow Saturday 14th, really excited to hear @GlenFordBAR and many others at the webinar   'Uniting Against Racism and the New Cold War'.   Glen is the founder of @blkagendareport and is a powerful critic of imperialism and white supremacy.  It should be a great event!  https://t.co/gqnGFmZ6fF

1327144773908656130 2020-11-13 15:02:25 +0800 <SocialistAct> BBC is an arm of the State.  EHRC is an arm of government. It was never going to find BBC guilty. EHRC role is not to highlighlight inequality, but to weaponise the issue on behalf of government   https://t.co/yrX1v1GLUo
1327140750228860929 2020-11-13 14:46:26 +0800 <SocialistAct> This makes no sense.  Obama won two terms and wasn't even on the ballot in 2016. There is a very large body of racist voters in the US.  But Obama offers no explanation of why they grew *after* he had been in office, or what Trump's 2016 coalition was.    https://t.co/jAZ7Oz038H
1326957623124619264 2020-11-13 02:38:45 +0800 <SocialistAct> 33,470 new cases are recorded more than 2 weeks after the government introduced the Tier system  It was clearly useless  Like everything this government does, including the current fake lockdown
1326948654205251586 2020-11-13 02:03:07 +0800 <SocialistAct> 33,470 new cases is far higher than the previous peak and is an increase of 44% over yesterday  No data yet on latest daily toll- which has often been a very bad sign  https://t.co/hmt0ebGyYl
1326947814933487618 2020-11-13 01:59:47 +0800 <SocialistAct> David Goodhart investigating racist policies is a sick joke    https://t.co/7NwymiUGuQ
1326947488373346306 2020-11-13 01:58:29 +0800 <SocialistAct> Latest test &amp; trace weekly number of tests has fallen for 2nd week in a row  The number contacted &amp; the number asked to isolate fell  Less than 2 in 5 of those tests returned in 24 hours  And the measure for tests in care homes is returns within 3 days!  SERCO isn't working
1326945439187398659 2020-11-13 01:50:20 +0800 <SocialistAct> The govt insists on calling it 'NHS Test &amp; Trace'  It is a private sector test &amp; trace system  Free market strategists have dreamt of this for years  Keeping the powerful NHS brand name as private firms rake in £££  But it takes a special kinf of callous to do this in a pandemic
1326929790973177860 2020-11-13 00:48:09 +0800 <SocialistAct> Turkey seeks to produce Sputnik V vaccine at its facilities  https://t.co/NOCzD7IK9g
1326926616463896584 2020-11-13 00:35:33 +0800 <SocialistAct> Full support for #OccupyUoM  !  Students across the country have been treated like garbage - simply there to pay fees and rents, no regard for their safety or well-being  Support sudents fighting for being treated like humans!

1326867796190490624 2020-11-12 20:41:49 +0800 <SocialistAct> As Granma puts it: China &amp; Cuba have formed a “solid bond of mutual solidarity” in the fight against Covid19. Both have offered the world solidarity in this battle.  Cuba and China's cooperation is a powerful combined force for human progress.  https://t.co/LtL1TufUdB (3/3)
1326867794948976640 2020-11-12 20:41:48 +0800 <SocialistAct> Whilst the capitalist West suffers Covid19 &amp; economic catastrophes, socialist China has defeated Covid19, is making economic recovery &amp; has embraced new historic goals to build “a modern socialist country” in next 2-3 years &amp; taken global lead in tackling climate crisis. (2/3)
1326867793132851200 2020-11-12 20:41:48 +0800 <SocialistAct> Cuba’s Fidel Castro spoke emphatically on the historic achievements of Chinese socialism in 1994 Today socialism in China continues to make history: * Increased life expectancy from 36 years in 1949 to 76 yrs in 2020 * Brought 860 million people out of poverty in 40 years (1/3)  https://t.co/Nr9uxQv3id
1326859914900369408 2020-11-12 20:10:30 +0800 <SocialistAct> The government has not at all prioritised public health and has completely disregarded protecting the health of essential workers    https://t.co/F8AccBU7yp
1326825160255676418 2020-11-12 17:52:24 +0800 <SocialistAct> The North of Ireland Scotland Bristol Leeds  Liverpool London Manchester  All voted Remain  Not generally regarded as the bastions of the middle classes

1326810345667776512 2020-11-12 16:53:32 +0800 <SocialistAct> Three quarters of Labour members and supporters are Remainers  You can't win with just three-quarters  You become completely irrelevant with just one-quarter
1326809410233131010 2020-11-12 16:49:48 +0800 <SocialistAct> An outbreak of facing reality on Brexit, after Trump got dumped?  Barely seems possible in Downing Street
1326776077402984449 2020-11-12 14:37:21 +0800 <SocialistAct> "So far Sweden’s strategy has proven to be a dramatic failure. Four days ago we had eight times higher cases per capita than Finland and three and a half times more than Norway."  Sweden is not a model    https://t.co/K8TBcYYYGt
1326588813574074370 2020-11-12 02:13:14 +0800 <SocialistAct> UK now has more than 750 deaths per million from Covid-19, on Dept of Health data  True total is over 1,000 per million  China has 3 deaths per million, Viet Nam even lower  The countries that defend real human rights are China, Viet Nam+ others, not Britain

1326524773103513602 2020-11-11 21:58:46 +0800 <SocialistAct> All the leaders of the warring Empires claimed they wanted peace, but fought the war to the bitter end with millions dead. The only government which brought peace by withdrawing from the war was the Bolshevik government, led by Lenin.
1326524771429982209 2020-11-11 21:58:45 +0800 <SocialistAct> Lest we forget that 20 million people died in WW1, an inter-imperialist war of plunder.  As Lenin said it was: “two or three powerful world plunderers armed to the teeth (America, Britain, Japan), who are drawing the whole world into their war over the division of their booty.”  https://t.co/nSWKFB7Dws
1326522459168894982 2020-11-11 21:49:34 +0800 <SocialistAct> BLM is much more popular than the Democratic Party.  Any association with BLM could not possibly have damaged DEMs election performance.  (data source: exit poll reported in New York Times)  https://t.co/UzEbd3IpBT

1326515676773838848 2020-11-11 21:22:37 +0800 <SocialistAct> 532 new deaths reported yesterday  Economy headed to double-dip recession   Test &amp; trace system is failing   Doubts emerge over Pfizer vaccine  Cases mounting of huge Tory corruption  But here is the news.....pathetic
1326507529292165120 2020-11-11 20:50:14 +0800 <SocialistAct> Macron has failed to suppress the pandemic so is whipping up Islamophobia   https://t.co/l4ar2dhEx6  https://t.co/xU1GOOBXS5
1326499013118586882 2020-11-11 20:16:24 +0800 <SocialistAct> Close the schools!    https://t.co/evhYpTBroq
1326494920803315713 2020-11-11 20:00:08 +0800 <SocialistAct> If the Pfizer vaccine is very expensive (&amp; just storing it sounds like it might be) but other vaccines are much cheaper or even free, will the British government insist on your taxes being paid to Pfizer anyway?  And will Labour object?
1326475973987012610 2020-11-11 18:44:51 +0800 <SocialistAct> It was why they renewed their campaign of sabotage
1326475446721142786 2020-11-11 18:42:45 +0800 <SocialistAct> "Attendance data in England &amp; Wales confirm the significant role school attendance plays in transmission".
1326474252611170304 2020-11-11 18:38:01 +0800 <SocialistAct> Not exactly a vote of confidence, is it?    https://t.co/uevdYaglRR
1326423399757975554 2020-11-11 15:15:56 +0800 <SocialistAct> At every stage, from schools reopening to pub times, Starmer has criticised Johnson from anti-lockdown position  Against the science, against public opinion, against public health    https://t.co/rdiP5e9asx via @MailOnline
1326422646817509376 2020-11-11 15:12:57 +0800 <SocialistAct> Spycops inquiry looks like it's on course to be a whitewash  More keen to protect cops than uncover scale of their illegal activity   https://t.co/jNfp7fekCF
1326419229256667137 2020-11-11 14:59:22 +0800 <SocialistAct> Political depravity  More important to Bolsonaro - and his co-thnkers about 'vaccine wars' - that a Chinese trial is halted rather than millions of Brazilians are protected    https://t.co/JSzlmiqcl4
1326233392501960706 2020-11-11 02:40:55 +0800 <SocialistAct> Utterly reckless and complacent to talk about virus as if it's all coming to an end  532 UK dead in single day, tens of thousands in total  Viet Nam (a larger, poorer country) total death stands at 35  That is putting people's health first, as in China, Aus, NZ
1326216310934675459 2020-11-11 01:33:03 +0800 <SocialistAct> Obama offered hope and change but delivered little  Which must partly explain DEM loss in 2016  Yet Trump has lost decisively this time  Because politics comes before economics, ©️Lenin  #BlackLivesMatter  is hugely more popular than DEMs at 57% - and saved Biden's skin v Trump
1326216306425729030 2020-11-11 01:33:02 +0800 <SocialistAct> The rise in real wages under Trump was strong by recent standards  And the wage share of US national income rose!  This must be one of the reasons for Trump's strong 2020 showing  It contrasts with Obama  Real wages:  Trump +11.75% in just under 4 years Obama +2.6% in 8 years
1326216303598854144 2020-11-11 01:33:01 +0800 <SocialistAct> There seems to be some surprise at FT piece today, arguing that Trump delivered higher real wages.  Assoc. editor @sarahoconnor_ commenting on this.  This is factually correct, and she and the FT piece are right  As @SocialistAct pointed out some time ago....
1326161960287825922 2020-11-10 21:57:04 +0800 <SocialistAct> No Deals proliferating

1326147922963148800 2020-11-10 21:01:18 +0800 <SocialistAct> In 'Natives', Akala praises Cuba's decisive role in the struggle to end Apartheid in South Africa.  As Nelson Mandela said: “The Cuban internationalists have made a contribution to African independence, freedom and justice unparalleled for its principled and selfless character."  https://t.co/6AnKZIk7fC

1326097915635445760 2020-11-10 17:42:35 +0800 <SocialistAct> Tory Cabinet is now being very even-handed with both the EU and US  Telling them both Britain wants No Deal with either of them  #Weholdallthecards
1326076380237455361 2020-11-10 16:17:01 +0800 <SocialistAct> Esper fired for refusing to send active duty troops against #BlackLivesMatter   Local cops, Feds, National Guard weren't enough.  Trump really did want civil war backdrop to get himself elected    https://t.co/k9ETjGPN4c
1326075397637890053 2020-11-10 16:13:06 +0800 <SocialistAct> Why is Keir Starmer allowed to speak about Corbyn's suspension, to boast about it at every opportunity, but Labour Party members aren't allowed to discuss it????  That aint democracy
1326074033931218947 2020-11-10 16:07:41 +0800 <SocialistAct> The same Ofsted who said its inspectors wouldn't be going into schools to protect them Now claims to know that fitness has deteriorated, basic skills lost and even potty-training forgotten This is policy based evidence-making, to support govt keeping schools open  @Parents_Utd
1326065834809303040 2020-11-10 15:35:06 +0800 <SocialistAct> Very important to learn where Biden will take US foreign policy This is a good place to start
1325887128312684544 2020-11-10 03:44:59 +0800 <SocialistAct> Brilliant image!  MLK was a great devotee of non-violence.  But you have to defend yourself!
1325820016646893568 2020-11-09 23:18:19 +0800 <SocialistAct> You omitted political ill-will
1325712833812836352 2020-11-09 16:12:24 +0800 <SocialistAct> Labour right claim Biden's victory as their own ignore these pledges: raise corporate taxes huge investment to tackle climate change big increases in spending on healthcare &amp; education raise the minimum wage  Biden may not do any of these But this is the basis for his win
1325711133324546048 2020-11-09 16:05:39 +0800 <SocialistAct> Through the whole crisis the treatment of disabled people has been outrageous and vile  It is continuing even now   https://t.co/GIkoSIB7sl
1325710662044102658 2020-11-09 16:03:47 +0800 <SocialistAct> Marcus Rashford is a hero  "They managed to U-turn on 2 of the 3 things we wanted and we will be sitting down to talk about the third"  Now all the disgusting Tory MPs who voted against free school meals should be asked, why?
1325702585001664512 2020-11-09 15:31:41 +0800 <SocialistAct> Cuts have decimated the NHS and letting the virus spread has taken it down  The latest mockdown is simply an effort to get the govt off the hook over their epic failures to protect the NHS  Never once putting public health first   https://t.co/coqeUx8iuZ

1325523973698965511 2020-11-09 03:41:57 +0800 <SocialistAct> Like Johnson, for Trump all politics is also personal aggrandisenent and shakedown

1324746840521232390 2020-11-07 00:13:54 +0800 <SocialistAct> What,  1. get rid of the best, most popular candidate 2. put up someone who doesn't enthuse anybody and all polls say he won't win 3. wait for for the PM to allow hundreds of thousands of his own citizens to die, to win by a tiny margin?  Great plan

1324716755734929409 2020-11-06 22:14:21 +0800 <SocialistAct> FOX News has always sucked, even more than the rest.  When it's peddling, misogyny, racism, war.  And when it supported Trump.  But the Tumpers only now discover the Murdoch always switches to the winning side - to make false claims of political influence after the event

1324668592135249922 2020-11-06 19:02:58 +0800 <SocialistAct> This article is 6 months old  But still worth repeating, 'Crunching the coronavirus curve is better than flattening it, as New Zealand is showing', from @devisridhar    Crunching the curve to eliminate the virus, not flattening it to revive once again   https://t.co/0SN9hb84zk
1324649003313750018 2020-11-06 17:45:07 +0800 <SocialistAct> Your memory is very faulty  Opposing US wars, whether conducted by Biden, or Trump, Obama, Clintons, Bushes, Reagan, Nixon or Kennedy is the opposite of enabling fascism

1324478372802629632 2020-11-06 06:27:06 +0800 <SocialistAct> Many people around the world shocked that Trump's vote has risen since 2016, even if he loses the Presidency  But the US was built on settler colonialism, white supremacy  Appeal to both have a strong pull for many voters - and so Trump's continued appeal
1324470364039204865 2020-11-06 05:55:16 +0800 <SocialistAct> Excellent. The coup supporters must be purged from the State forces, otherwise they will use their power to mount another coup

1324261078344323075 2020-11-05 16:03:39 +0800 <SocialistAct> If *unarmed* #BlackLivesmatter supporters had done this they would have been attacked, pepper-sprayed, shot, jailed  But in a state based on white supremacy, white supremacists expect and get very different treatment
1324241463941713921 2020-11-05 14:45:42 +0800 <SocialistAct> The role of government in setting economic conditions is widely undersestimated  Hoping to get re-elected, Trump did nothing to stop the big rise in US real wages  https://t.co/bVCkfbmjoE
1324114126986268677 2020-11-05 06:19:43 +0800 <SocialistAct> Bernie would have wiped the floor with Trump  The DNC knew that, but preferred to take the risk
1324090608600965120 2020-11-05 04:46:16 +0800 <SocialistAct> Stop the count is a large, open voter suppression movement  Unusually, it's not just aimed at Black people and the poor

1324034795089940481 2020-11-05 01:04:29 +0800 <SocialistAct> Tuesdays now established as a very high day total for new deaths  Even so, almost 500 new deaths is a complete indictment of this government and the Covid-deniers
1324021803283566592 2020-11-05 00:12:51 +0800 <SocialistAct> The candidates who don't get a majority of the votes repeatedly win the elections, or can resort to courts that they or their predecessors nominated  That's not even a semblance of democracy  (Although the UK is even less democratic)

1323949670205456386 2020-11-04 19:26:13 +0800 <SocialistAct> Trouble is, they've been saying that for 4 years  Their record is sanctions agaisnt Iran, sanctions against Russia every year  That's it

1323901373843460101 2020-11-04 16:14:19 +0800 <SocialistAct> A myth beloved by Brexiteers is that Trump represents 'the left behind'  He really doesn't  Massively behind in all households with income lower than $100,000  https://t.co/vl7LEV3bbD
1323896571877040128 2020-11-04 15:55:14 +0800 <SocialistAct> A few days after US election result is known, Johnson will produce one of the plans already written  Trump is disastrous No Deal and take whatever trade deal he offers  Biden is a series of damaging and messy deals with EU, and begging Biden to be nice
1323895590116298752 2020-11-04 15:51:20 +0800 <SocialistAct> 'Lawfare' in the USA  Using the courts has been a favourite tactic of the US-backed coup plotters across Latin America  Now Trump declares victory *and* he will go to court to rig it

1323891085312143361 2020-11-04 15:33:26 +0800 <SocialistAct> Doesn't seem to expect to win once votes are counted  But Trump is relying on Supreme Court that the Republicans packed, while the Democrats were too busy fighting the Left to stop them
1323887838933430273 2020-11-04 15:20:32 +0800 <SocialistAct> US ruling class is engaged in US class offensive against workers and the poor.  (British ruling class trying to copy them)   https://t.co/LygajmcWIG
1323884274144129025 2020-11-04 15:06:22 +0800 <SocialistAct> Very poor presentation of national US exit poll from BBC - no national total given  But seems clear that Trump lost the popular vote again with big loss among women  https://t.co/BkgpH4NWv5
1323873529591451649 2020-11-04 14:23:40 +0800 <SocialistAct> If only 'centrists' were as good at fighting the Right as they are at attacking the Left
1323871618763030528 2020-11-04 14:16:04 +0800 <SocialistAct> US system is entirely skewed towards suburban, rural voters  Historically, this comes from being skewed towards the smaller, slave-owning States  US still living with the legacy of slavery, Black Americans dying with the legacy

1323661529716297730 2020-11-04 00:21:15 +0800 <SocialistAct> Lots of misleading or just plain stupid assertions that 'X is literally the textbook definition of #Marxism' as it trends on Twitter on US election day  This is best textbook definition of Marxism, from Lenin   https://t.co/kD4hXq1vMK

1323018017018728454 2020-11-02 05:44:10 +0800 <SocialistAct> Very good to clearly, unequivocally support Jeremy Corbyn  Ian Byrne a solid ally  But EHRC should not be implemented. It's deeply reactionary recommendations are designed to hobble Labour forever

1317743977626505216 2020-10-18 16:27:01 +0800 <SocialistAct> Proper financial support is needed to make lockdown work -  100% pay for workers, proper support for self-employed, sick pay, and support for struggling businesses if they don't fire people  And full lockdown for 6 weeks is needed - Tiers won't work
1317742088914612224 2020-10-18 16:19:31 +0800 <SocialistAct> It seems possible the coup plotters in Bolivia are planning to overturn a MAS victory
1317736860890861570 2020-10-18 15:58:44 +0800 <SocialistAct> You are more than 3 times as likely to be admitted to an ICU with coronavirus if you are in the poorest communities compared to the richest ones -  the spread of the virus is also a class issue as well as an issue of racist discrimination
1317735874222804993 2020-10-18 15:54:49 +0800 <SocialistAct> More than a quarter of all ICU admissions for Covid-19 in the upsurge since September 1 are at Black or Asian people - hugely over-represented

1317427645617967104 2020-10-17 19:30:01 +0800 <SocialistAct> International Conference against the racist offensive - taking place this afternoon and tomorrow.  Click here for the line-up and to register:  https://t.co/CxKhkXAnod
1317374529325436928 2020-10-17 15:58:58 +0800 <SocialistAct> If we subtract all the Tory voters sending their children to private schools getting tested every day it could be much closer to 40%-40% even for them
1317374141838872576 2020-10-17 15:57:25 +0800 <SocialistAct> And where is the outrage from all the Western champions of human rights, democracy and free elections?  Silence
1317373476181770240 2020-10-17 15:54:46 +0800 <SocialistAct> Argentine legislators were mistreated on arriving in La Paz to fulfil their duties as observers of the elections next Sunday. It is the direct responsibility of the de facto government of @JeanineAnez to preserve the integrity of the Argentine delegation.  #EleccionesBolivia2020
1317372964422254592 2020-10-17 15:52:44 +0800 <SocialistAct> "#ISIS is adopting a hit-&amp;-run technique &amp; finds refuge in al-Tanf triangle were #US forbid any force to enter the 55 sq km."  Having failed to overthrow Assad using 'rebels' US has been protecting ISIS to prevent reunification of Syria
1317371176465932288 2020-10-17 15:45:38 +0800 <SocialistAct> Rinse and repeat in British politics -people voting for parties who have no interest in defending their jobs or livelihoods  And then suing them when they destroy jobs  And then losing in court, because every British government is 'sovereign' and can pretty much do what it likes
1317358822185369600 2020-10-17 14:56:33 +0800 <SocialistAct> What did they do, think of a number, double it, then add a nought?  Then said, hey you're good customers, here's a 10% discount.  If only the government had spent half as much effort on eliminating the virus as they have on enriching themselves, their families and their donors
1317358109422194689 2020-10-17 14:53:43 +0800 <SocialistAct> But there's no money for a nurses' pay rise???
1317356282307891201 2020-10-17 14:46:27 +0800 <SocialistAct> Who knew that a government which put people first in a public health crisis would actually prove popular with the people?  NZ learnt from China, Viet Nam and has effectively eliminated the virus.  Want to return to normal?  Be like NZ. Be like Viet Nam. Be like China.
1317346983665958912 2020-10-17 14:09:30 +0800 <SocialistAct> Trumponomics with British characteristics
1317142929232809984 2020-10-17 00:38:40 +0800 <SocialistAct> 215,000 human lives weren't held to be that important at all
1317126688795406338 2020-10-16 23:34:08 +0800 <SocialistAct> There is is no EU-Australia free trade deal  This is WTO arrangements, with both tariffs and non-tariff barriers  Will be diastrous for jobs in Britain, on top of the tsunami of Covid-19 job losses
1317124161475661827 2020-10-16 23:24:05 +0800 <SocialistAct> With the brilliant judgement and timing the Tory government has become famous for -  Boris Johnson decides to go for disastrous No Deal that only benefits Trump, just as President who installed him as PM could be on the way out
1317123444799082497 2020-10-16 23:21:14 +0800 <SocialistAct> British and French ruling classes at work overseas, whose only regret about their entire despicable colonial histories is that the US has long surpassed them
1317058237645074436 2020-10-16 19:02:08 +0800 <SocialistAct> As Malcolm X said, racism and the fight against it are international.  A brilliant International Conference against the racist offensive is taking place this weekend (17 and 18 Oct) Organised by @AntiRacismDay  Click here for the line-up and to register:  https://t.co/OaWmGH58jf  https://t.co/5dj0GFL0Mp
1317021432954687489 2020-10-16 16:35:53 +0800 <SocialistAct> Last time Britain lost the Cod Wars with Iceland, it led to the decimation of the British fishing fleet  This type of nonsense will end the same way, if followed
1317016082834665472 2020-10-16 16:14:37 +0800 <SocialistAct> "Are you now, or have you ever been to China?"  Disgusting red-baiting sweeping the Western countries  Anyone denying there is a new cold war is deluding themselves   https://t.co/T4FqoS38Nj
1316996531875155969 2020-10-16 14:56:56 +0800 <SocialistAct> Begins tomorrow!  Stand Up to Racism online conference  The government is responsible for the public health crisis and the jobs crisis.  Don't let them divide us with racist scapegoating.  Join us online!  This Saturday and Sunday 17th and 18th October  https://t.co/M0YqmqPCOX
1316994182142111744 2020-10-16 14:47:36 +0800 <SocialistAct> Tiers are not enough and, Yes, we do need a national lockdown  And government must come up with the funds to support it  And fix the chaotic test &amp; trace system
1316987345355288579 2020-10-16 14:20:26 +0800 <SocialistAct> UK has one last chance to save the Good Friday Agreement - @MaryLouMcDonald    https://t.co/E8x9urZM97
1316985821451386880 2020-10-16 14:14:22 +0800 <SocialistAct> The public supports stricter measures  The blockage is the politicians
1316983445697024001 2020-10-16 14:04:56 +0800 <SocialistAct> It can and does happen here  Kevin Clarke was restrained by police even while he was in handcuffs.  He died later in police custody  #BlackLivesMatter     https://t.co/oCs6SadXVW
1316853201388417031 2020-10-16 05:27:23 +0800 <SocialistAct> Antiracism is great, everyone should be anti-racist. But revolutionary Black nationalism is an answer to the question of racism  Anticapitalism is mainly progressive, but communism is the only progressive alternative to capitalism
1316793662303539207 2020-10-16 01:30:48 +0800 <SocialistAct> Andy Burnham is right  In fact, 100% support is possible, if there is a proper lockdown as that can be as little as 6 to 8 weeks  Continuous stop-go, letting the pandemic continue is much more damaging to lives and to the economy
1316791760144805889 2020-10-16 01:23:15 +0800 <SocialistAct> Because government refuses to @ucu has had to create its own dashboard for the rise in cases in the universities  It's grim reading   https://t.co/BeFaXp7Yez
1316788911633559552 2020-10-16 01:11:55 +0800 <SocialistAct> 35 Labour MPs who think that spies and cops should not be above the law, should not be free to disrupt, sexually assault, torture or murder  It should be much more, but 35 is a beginning
1316768373217406977 2020-10-15 23:50:19 +0800 <SocialistAct> The Black Panther Panther Party is not just for the history books  It's militants are still in jail  And it's ideas are still alive!  Free em all.  Free all Panthers still behind bars!
1316730571192782860 2020-10-15 21:20:06 +0800 <SocialistAct> Of course all local authorities must get financial support to cope with effects of restrictions, as well as businesses who retain jobs  It's necesaary to make lockdown work  Workers should get 100% of wages if lockdown is effective as it would last only 6 to 8 weeks
1316729831413948418 2020-10-15 21:17:10 +0800 <SocialistAct> LauraK:  The argument continues on funding for local authorities coping with new restrictions BBC presenter: Local leaders just said that they were told there was no new money. Yet Matthew Hancock tells the Commons that discussions are ongoing? LauraK: That's a holding position
1316723016764731392 2020-10-15 20:50:05 +0800 <SocialistAct> Guess the ban on demonstrations didn't work
1316718432453300225 2020-10-15 20:31:52 +0800 <SocialistAct> China’s rise: an inspiration for Bolivia in the fight against US-imposed poverty and indignity   https://t.co/UI8gXp3gLz  https://t.co/whtgyjmiIv
1316718024926388225 2020-10-15 20:30:15 +0800 <SocialistAct> Public remain way in advance of the government, the media and most politicians  Schools should be closed
1316717253849735170 2020-10-15 20:27:11 +0800 <SocialistAct> This needs to be fixed - and no 'circuit break' should end until it does
1316707285553602560 2020-10-15 19:47:34 +0800 <SocialistAct> Protests against police brutality in Nigeria have been enormous.  Often led by women.  And continuing despite even more police brutality  #EndSWAT   #EndSWAT
1316705690304557057 2020-10-15 19:41:14 +0800 <SocialistAct> Very good  #SpyCopsBill literally gives cops and spies a licence to kill  Everyone should be opposing it
1316646672617877509 2020-10-15 15:46:43 +0800 <SocialistAct> John Finucane's father Pat was murdered in front of him  The murder and many others were organised, carried out by undercover state agents  Excellent now on @BBCr4today in showing why how govt legislation would legalise those murders &amp; other crimes  Oppose the #SpyCopsBill
1316641669001994240 2020-10-15 15:26:50 +0800 <SocialistAct> The US Constitution is a legal agreement among men of property -including slave ownership - to regulate their common affairs  Of course, in UK we don't even have that.  You are a subject, not a citizen
1316639569954078721 2020-10-15 15:18:30 +0800 <SocialistAct> Labour council leader very clear on @BBCr4today   Tier 3 is not enough even to reduce R rate, as SAGE says  and  Govt financial support is pathetically low  So, tougher measures and much better funding are both needed to save lives and stop jobs being permanently lost
1316638067315429377 2020-10-15 15:12:31 +0800 <SocialistAct> There should be huge protest at this from all the camapaigners for human rights  But there won't be  Because Thailand is a state subordinated to the US, 'a friendly ally'    https://t.co/5RsyLb1vOg
1316637389868199936 2020-10-15 15:09:50 +0800 <SocialistAct> Workers and families forced into destitution, while £12 billion wasted on chaotic testing and tracing system and consultants paid over £7,000 per day  This is austerity under the cloak of Covid-19   https://t.co/43i8ZC2hTN
1316636543201824768 2020-10-15 15:06:28 +0800 <SocialistAct> Some consultants getting £7,630, while essential workers can't get a decent pay rise  Austerity under the cloak of Covid-19
1316636023007383552 2020-10-15 15:04:24 +0800 <SocialistAct> Despite what the press generally says, the public support for lockdown measures is overwhelming
1316626563740233728 2020-10-15 14:26:49 +0800 <SocialistAct> British government not doing enough, says OECD: Need to more to protect jobs Need to do more to combat virus Need to avoid diastrous Brexit crash out   https://t.co/mNWesgDWWD
1316625662283853824 2020-10-15 14:23:14 +0800 <SocialistAct> It wasn't just that the NHS was by-passed to benefit the private sector  NHS testing was dismantled completely in key areas to make bigger profits for the private companies   https://t.co/Rspdr891Oy
1316623086251368448 2020-10-15 14:13:00 +0800 <SocialistAct> Cops trying to claim Breonna Taylor's murder was somehow a mistake.  But all of them let her bleed to death - clearly a conscious decision.    Breonna Taylor was murdered  #BlackLivesMatter     https://t.co/SpUwVT2NoQ
1316621650574692353 2020-10-15 14:07:17 +0800 <SocialistAct> Killing of Michael Reinoehl was an assassination by cops, not an attempt at armed arrest   https://t.co/1a0UtZDzMg
1316487624618651648 2020-10-15 05:14:43 +0800 <SocialistAct> Because nothing says profits come before people more than  Handing over huge £££ to private sector who ar failing to test or trace the potentially sick and dying
1316486821593874433 2020-10-15 05:11:32 +0800 <SocialistAct> Boris Johnson and the rest of the charlatans are great recruiting sargeants for Scottish independence
1316486707601125376 2020-10-15 05:11:04 +0800 <SocialistAct> Boris Johnson and the rest of the charlatans are great recruiting sargeants for Scottish independence
1316423432343556097 2020-10-15 00:59:38 +0800 <SocialistAct> Anthony Costello is right - a 'circuit breaker' only works if the time is used to establish a proper test and trace system  The break should be extended to the point that cases are so low that the system can cope   https://t.co/0qLMjmzR2k
1316419178111303685 2020-10-15 00:42:44 +0800 <SocialistAct> Britain must hand over Venezuela's gold!
1316418432385069056 2020-10-15 00:39:46 +0800 <SocialistAct> Almost 20,000 new cases   New deaths almost doubling from a week ago  Waiting until half-term to announce slightly more restrictive measures is imposing a death sentence on some people  We need #ZeroCovid now!
1316406044449538048 2020-10-14 23:50:33 +0800 <SocialistAct> Millions of Americans can't get heatlhcare partly because Federal funding for defense goes to contractors who pay lobbyists to argue for more military spending
1316405478818222086 2020-10-14 23:48:18 +0800 <SocialistAct> Pro-democracy, anti-monarchy protests in Bangkok are huge
1316391737481474048 2020-10-14 22:53:42 +0800 <SocialistAct> The most important right is the right to life  If your government doesn't protect that, all other rights are undermined, conditional, insubstantial  (Clue: The governments of the large Western countries are not protecting your right to life)
1316387864159158273 2020-10-14 22:38:18 +0800 <SocialistAct> Don't believe British cops or spies would ever murder people?  Here's David Cameron admitting it in the case of Pat Finucane's murder   Oppose the #SpyCopsBill     https://t.co/qWPZpbq9mw
1316362468806066176 2020-10-14 20:57:24 +0800 <SocialistAct> China’s rise: an inspiration for Bolivia in the fight against US-imposed poverty and indignity  https://t.co/UdEuOb26Dq via @fio_edwards
1316360668937891841 2020-10-14 20:50:14 +0800 <SocialistAct> The superiority of socialist methods
1316360602944761856 2020-10-14 20:49:59 +0800 <SocialistAct> The superiority of socialist methods
1316359297891209217 2020-10-14 20:44:48 +0800 <SocialistAct> 24% of Scots haven't been paying attention
1316342488072966144 2020-10-14 19:38:00 +0800 <SocialistAct> The US presidential election and its effect on US relations with China   https://t.co/GSXQK3yec8  https://t.co/gt3Nh5ymqo
1316337755014791168 2020-10-14 19:19:11 +0800 <SocialistAct> British journalists who never expose any government wrongdoing or even criticise the government  Have no problem attacking scientists on scientific matters  Not telling truth to power, shouting power at truth
1316273312381775872 2020-10-14 15:03:07 +0800 <SocialistAct> Hospitalisations double in 16 days  Govt has lost control  #ZeroCovid needed
1316272910747697152 2020-10-14 15:01:31 +0800 <SocialistAct> Western governments, especially US and UK assume Chine uses popular technology for mass spying on the population  Because that is what they do reoutinely
1316272578735091713 2020-10-14 15:00:12 +0800 <SocialistAct> If this was a US client state, the Guardian would be praising the use of effective traditional medicines
1316272206721224705 2020-10-14 14:58:43 +0800 <SocialistAct> The OAS participated in the coup after th last elections  The US wages a multinational 'lawfare' campaign, using the courts and outfits like the OAS to overthrow popular leftist governments  Don't let the US and its lackey steal the Bolivian election!
1316271708416995330 2020-10-14 14:56:45 +0800 <SocialistAct> Don't let Britain steal Venezuela's gold!  Don't let Britain follow US orders in trying to destroy the legtimate government of Venzuela!
1316270588109950976 2020-10-14 14:52:17 +0800 <SocialistAct> BBC repeats myth that 'shy Trump' voters won in 2016  Trump's vote was way below his polls- just 25.7% of electorate  But Clinton's vote was even lower than her polling, and the electoral college skews the result  If Biden loses now it's on him   https://t.co/nrbGf7atqk
1316268390403788801 2020-10-14 14:43:34 +0800 <SocialistAct> Important development  Schools need to be closed as part of anything than can realistically be called a lockdown   https://t.co/fGv2HSXeWf
1316258987285909506 2020-10-14 14:06:12 +0800 <SocialistAct> Saudi Arabia not elected but Russia and China are   Seems majority of world's countries reject US conception of 'human rights' - doing what US tells you    https://t.co/OJQjO8e5Nf
1316125204804968448 2020-10-14 05:14:35 +0800 <SocialistAct> Completely reckless disregard for health and life to insist on students going to university during a pandemic   #Toriesliedpeopledied
1316121779098849280 2020-10-14 05:00:59 +0800 <SocialistAct> Quite right. They have followed the Chinese model.
1316067356096057346 2020-10-14 01:24:43 +0800 <SocialistAct> Time to take back control:  Testing and tracing need to be nationalised, put in hands of local authorities and NHS  Not this shower
1316065371015860224 2020-10-14 01:16:50 +0800 <SocialistAct> Important that Starmer has moved  But he highlights fatal flaw in his plan himself  March lockdown was not long or thorough enough - even with closed schools  Need a full lockdown to bring cases down to level where testing &amp; tracing can cope with small outbreaks  So 6-8 weeks
1316050359132061697 2020-10-14 00:17:11 +0800 <SocialistAct> This is better and long overdue from Starmer  But clearly should include schools  And should be aimed at #ZeroCOVID   Getting R down is not enough.  R rate fell below 1 because of previous lockdown but not far enough to crush the virus
1316048831205777410 2020-10-14 00:11:07 +0800 <SocialistAct> ONS data show Covid19 deaths are much higher than Dept of Health data, about one-third higher
1316047088514486272 2020-10-14 00:04:11 +0800 <SocialistAct> Terrible Over 17,000 new cases 143 new deaths, way above new 7-day average of 82  Still govt refuses to implement effective lockdowns (all non-essential workers stay home) + proper tracking, tracing &amp; isolation, and offers only completely inadequate financial support  Criminal
1316026589654642688 2020-10-13 22:42:44 +0800 <SocialistAct> Very good.  Also need strong financial support for locked-down workers, including original 80% furlough payments, proper sick pay, support for self-employed, renters and struggling small businesses
1315985008436314113 2020-10-13 19:57:30 +0800 <SocialistAct> This government has deliberately stirred up racial hatred, Islamophobia and other vile ideologies as a pure distraction from the crises they caused   https://t.co/4AzWn6PDGZ
1315983080650428417 2020-10-13 19:49:50 +0800 <SocialistAct> Test and trace system needs to large enough to cope with cases, quick enough to provide timely results and to grow at same rate as virus to be any use  SAGE says the privatised system it isn't any of these things    https://t.co/AKpHYTX11B

1315978176254881792 2020-10-13 19:30:21 +0800 <SocialistAct> Such an enormous scandal, even the BBC can't ignore it  SAGE advice on September 21 was to more to serious lockdown measures  The government has refused to follow scientific advice
1315948686988500993 2020-10-13 17:33:10 +0800 <SocialistAct> Everywhere *should* be in lockdown to suppress the virus  It's clear that government is not locking down Tory-voting areas - and Liverpool is the most Labour city in the country

1315917930966773761 2020-10-13 15:30:57 +0800 <SocialistAct> This is a false claim  The Human Rights Memorandum published with the Bill says explicitly; those acting for the State will be exempted from HRA  It is a police state measure, putting spies and cops above the law for the most serious crimes

1315903396000468999 2020-10-13 14:33:12 +0800 <SocialistAct> Immoral because "herd immunity is achieved by shielding people from infection, not exposijg them to it...Never in the history of public health has herd immunity been used as a strategy for responding to an outbreak, let alone a pandemic"  https://t.co/w31vTNhIl9
1315899296538128384 2020-10-13 14:16:55 +0800 <SocialistAct> Ministers ignored SAGE advice that lockdown was needed to prevent resurgence in cases  In fact that was when they stepped up their campaign to get workers back to work - and forced students to go to university    https://t.co/LPyztAILhy
1315897485924106246 2020-10-13 14:09:43 +0800 <SocialistAct> Completely untrue to say this is a return to lockdown  Non-essential workers still forced to go to work,  schools still forced to stay open- even with rising cases  As government's chief scientific adviser says these measures will not halt the spread of the virus just slow it  https://t.co/dEbu5WkJ4F

1315706736964231168 2020-10-13 01:31:45 +0800 <SocialistAct> Ho Chi Minh wrote 'The Black Race' in 1924, inspired by his time in Harlem: “It is well-known that the Black race is the most oppressed &amp; the most exploited of the human family... the spread of capitalism... had as an immediate result the rebirth of slavery." {1/2}  https://t.co/4qN1ikmMFv

1315697369984512001 2020-10-13 00:54:32 +0800 <SocialistAct> These hospitalisations data are up to October 1st  Clearly show that NHS was already under strain  Yet government has waited 10 days before acting  And once again it is a confusing mess of rules, no lockdown
1315695657903099904 2020-10-13 00:47:43 +0800 <SocialistAct> Claims that cases are rising 'because we're testing more' are pure fiction  In a short period the rate of postive tests has more than quadrupled
1315652031047258113 2020-10-12 21:54:22 +0800 <SocialistAct> In a statement released yesterday the Bolivarian government of #Venezuela denounced the consequences of the US blockade on their right to integral development, emphasizing the "deadly impact" for at least 40 thousand affected citizens.   The blockade is a weapon of war
1315640201188913157 2020-10-12 21:07:22 +0800 <SocialistAct> MPs told, "The government has prioritised keeping education and work settings open due to the significant and long-term benefits to society" reports The Times  It's clear.  Putting profits before people

1315570969877131264 2020-10-12 16:32:16 +0800 <SocialistAct> The 'lockdowns' announced are social curfews  Most non-essential workers still told to work, schools open, no proper testing &amp; tracing  Rules almost designed to cause maximum inconvenience with the minimal effectiveness  We need: Lockdown + full furlough scheme + testing

1315233270624182272 2020-10-11 18:10:22 +0800 <SocialistAct> Local government to be given responsibility for testing and tracing with 'volunteers', meaning no money  All the money has been taken, by Serco, Deloittes, etc  Real risk that this is simply devolution of a public health catastrophe + austerity
1315229476251369477 2020-10-11 17:55:17 +0800 <SocialistAct> Great!
1315222595608797184 2020-10-11 17:27:57 +0800 <SocialistAct> US Administration was hoping that it would be a 'cataclysmic event', China's Chernobyl  But whole of government, whole of society response allowed Chine to effectively eliminate the virus  The catastrophe was the US death toll, and other Western countries
1315213119908655104 2020-10-11 16:50:17 +0800 <SocialistAct> The resurgence in cases cannot be blamed on the public  The responsibility lies with the government who ended lockdown too early and introduced meaningless rules as a fake substitute  And the Labour leadership who agreed every Tory step
1315211796509327360 2020-10-11 16:45:02 +0800 <SocialistAct> A *net* 51% support 'Implementing a local lockdown where I live if cases are rising'  Big lie to claim cases and deaths are rising because the public won't stick to rules  The government doesn't have the rules to eliminate the virus
1315211041811451904 2020-10-11 16:42:02 +0800 <SocialistAct> But remember, There is no magic money tree to pay essential workers!
1315207473851228160 2020-10-11 16:27:51 +0800 <SocialistAct> Pubs &amp; bars are not the main location for infections  Biggest single location for infection is 'educational establishments'  They should all be shut for an effective lockdown - all non-essential workers should be at home, schools closed, bars and restaurants closed #ZeroCovid
1314955633855258624 2020-10-10 23:47:08 +0800 <SocialistAct> Why not add Sao Paulo too, so there can be an air vector between three of the most infected places in the world
1314954984027500544 2020-10-10 23:44:33 +0800 <SocialistAct> This is true as, in a different way, this article also shows   https://t.co/3ToBxkC8fH
1314915452976533506 2020-10-10 21:07:28 +0800 <SocialistAct> As Angela Davis says:  "By failing to recognize the material forces of racism that are responsible for offering up such large numbers of black and Latino youth to the carceral state, the process of criminalization imputes responsibility to the individuals who are its casualties."  https://t.co/kuMCXOwIfm
1314915449948254208 2020-10-10 21:07:27 +0800 <SocialistAct> The systemic racism of US criminal justice system is clear.   Black people are 5.6 times more likely to be imprisoned than whites.  Hispanic people are 2.9 times more likely.   US imprisonment rates per 100,000 adults in 2018:  1,501 for Black 797 for Hispanic 268 for White
1314885722659262464 2020-10-10 19:09:20 +0800 <SocialistAct> Macron and Trump become activists against Islamophia? Except that they are liars! No there is no concentration camp or re-education for the Uyghurs. No there is no genocide of the Uyghurs.
1314885277765324800 2020-10-10 19:07:34 +0800 <SocialistAct> There is never, ever any coverage like this of the Tory government from the BBC  And it isn't because it has handled the crisis so much better  The State broadcaster doing its job
1314877662612066304 2020-10-10 18:37:18 +0800 <SocialistAct> The Times today continues the British press propaganda campaign in favour of the 'Swedish model'  This is the reality
1314863735408857091 2020-10-10 17:41:58 +0800 <SocialistAct> Thanks Solidarity Sue  Solidarity to you and to all comrades!
1314855969994739712 2020-10-10 17:11:06 +0800 <SocialistAct> It's the only way Boris Johnson can avoid the accusation of lying  Get someone else to do his lying for him
1314850138398101504 2020-10-10 16:47:56 +0800 <SocialistAct> Now that they've been clapped and some given gongs  Is there any chance this government could provide essential workers with safe workplaces, proper kit and a decent pay rise?
1314848336520843264 2020-10-10 16:40:46 +0800 <SocialistAct> Hospitalisations doubling around every 2 weeks means underfunded and understaffed NHS will soon be overwhelmed  As this government clearly puts profits before people, deaths &amp; cases don't bother them  But news items showing patients in corridors might finally force them to act
1314845360976809984 2020-10-10 16:28:57 +0800 <SocialistAct> John Rentoul also very critical - even Blairites unhappy with Starmer
1314844607801364480 2020-10-10 16:25:57 +0800 <SocialistAct> This is ridiculous  Propaganda tools that are literally funded by arms of the US government including the CIA are not branded 'US state-affiliated media'  US exceptionalism is really US surpremacism
1314840932194320386 2020-10-10 16:11:21 +0800 <SocialistAct> Govt says R rate is 1.2 to 1.5, cases rise rapidly  2 highest regions now are East of England and the South West both 1.3 to 1.6  They will rapidly catch-up other badly affected areas, North East, North West and now London  A national lockdown is needed- even Tory constituencies
1314839596300197893 2020-10-10 16:06:02 +0800 <SocialistAct> The public is also right to be furious  It's our money given to Mickey Mouse firms who then don't deliver crucial kit or services  £10 billion on failed track and tracing
1314836524513533952 2020-10-10 15:53:50 +0800 <SocialistAct> 2019 election was not a popular surge for CON despite what Tory press says. CON rose just1.2% vs 2017- but received a surge in seats (+47)  Biggest change in 2017 was LAB loss of 7.8% and the gainers were (%, in order): LDs 4.2 CON 1.2 GRN 1.1 SNP 0.8   https://t.co/EZIF29wgeB
1314830853990739969 2020-10-10 15:31:18 +0800 <SocialistAct> Just digusting  The Home Office knows that the deportation of criminals has *nothing* to  with asylum seekers  But when you've allowed the worst public health crisis for 100 years + the worst economic slump for 90 years  You need scapegoats, however unjustified it might be  Vile
1314595764128145410 2020-10-09 23:57:08 +0800 <SocialistAct> Exactly
1314591345030332417 2020-10-09 23:39:35 +0800 <SocialistAct> New scheme is too mean, too narrow, and maybe too late to stop huge job losses and rising poverty
1314549171798577152 2020-10-09 20:52:00 +0800 <SocialistAct> Another 'world-beating' performance from the government  Tests being returned promptly are very low and/or in decline  Without an effective testing system the virus is left to take its own course
1314535855722237952 2020-10-09 19:59:05 +0800 <SocialistAct> UK GDP rebound slowed to a crawl in August  And most of that was due to the unsustainable 'Eat to Help Out' scheme, which probably increased the rate of new inflections   https://t.co/Q3avjijnkO

1314505355104325632 2020-10-09 17:57:53 +0800 <SocialistAct> It's rare that anyone, even this government, directly lies.  Much more usual is distortion, even complete distortion of actual facts.  But @skwawkbox has done a great service by exposing this blatant lie by government - the schools are the main source of the renewed outbreak

1314486947876831237 2020-10-09 16:44:45 +0800 <SocialistAct> Austerity was a transfer of incomes from workers to business, from poor to rich  Disgracefully, the Covid-19 crisis has been used to do exactly the same directly and indirectly
1314484325782556673 2020-10-09 16:34:19 +0800 <SocialistAct> The facts so obvious, even the IMF recognises them  Lockdown are a faster way to economic recovery  But the drive for short-term profits means that most of the Western governments will carry on letting the virus spread

1314463511175667712 2020-10-09 15:11:37 +0800 <SocialistAct> These partial an ineffective measures are actually doing more damage to lives and livelihoods than a strict 6 to 8 week lockdown would do  We need #ZeroCovid     https://t.co/PPY1KqMwf7 via @MailOnline

1314312448657297409 2020-10-09 05:11:21 +0800 <SocialistAct> Maybe because you need a lot more medical and other workers to run additional hospitals and there is already a shortage of over 100,000 staff after 10 years of Tory underfunding the NHS
1314257287889014787 2020-10-09 01:32:09 +0800 <SocialistAct> But Labour leadership supported  reopening of schools return of university students return to work  No ifs, no buts
1314255455544315906 2020-10-09 01:24:52 +0800 <SocialistAct> Empires don't decline because stupid people have risen to the top  The Empire's decline produces people at the top who refuse to face reality and say incredibly stupid things as a distraction  (See also, Johnson, Gove, Sunak, Raab, Patel, etc, etc)
1314253433822752774 2020-10-09 01:16:50 +0800 <SocialistAct> Trump wanted to demonise #BlackLivesMatter  in the election campaign, running on a law and order ticket  If he is defeated, and it's still unclear, it will be despite Biden's record &amp; campaign  It will be because #BlackLivesMatter  stood up to Trump   https://t.co/BJtZlZxDen

It still can  https://t.co/TOihnTxW4U
1314100413868773378 2020-10-08 15:08:48 +0800 <SocialistAct> Experts debunk 'focused protection' - letting virus spread while protecting the vulnerable  "This declaration prioritises....protecting the vulnerable and suggests we can safely build up ‘herd immunity’ in the rest of the population.

1313875119555702784 2020-10-08 00:13:33 +0800 <SocialistAct> There is no merit in arguing that 'we have done better than Boris Johnson' on coronavirus deaths  His record is literally one of the worst in the world
1313874675940945922 2020-10-08 00:11:48 +0800 <SocialistAct> If Keir Starmer ever criticised the government and put forward concrete policy alternatives to support workers, renters or the poor, he would be applauded and supported  But he never does  It's laughable to suggest he is a continuity Corbynism leader
1313858819127160832 2020-10-07 23:08:47 +0800 <SocialistAct> So the egotism of one pro-coup candidate means the withdrawal won't fully their main candidate - and others are too late to withdraw  Even in dangerous situations, sometimes the enemies of progress are laughable
1313825950040285184 2020-10-07 20:58:10 +0800 <SocialistAct> The people who want Len McCluskey out of the Labour Party  But don't want the Tories out of government  Are Tories

1313763208457527297 2020-10-07 16:48:52 +0800 <SocialistAct> There should be more funding, more info, and more local control through the NHS, not SERCO, Deloitte and others  But there should also be more lockdown.  Much more, not less
1313758843013398529 2020-10-07 16:31:31 +0800 <SocialistAct> This is not the treatment that Trump got   And Adeline Fagan will be a great loss to humanity
1313756973851201537 2020-10-07 16:24:05 +0800 <SocialistAct> Almost an effective reply  Except you're an unelected legislator  Telling an elected union General Secretary Len McCluskey to get out of the Labour Party  When your only elected position was as a councillor for the SDP and the LibDems

1313724395349778433 2020-10-07 14:14:38 +0800 <SocialistAct> UCU said all along that all possible classes should be moved online  But government and management made false promises about face to face classes to get fees and rents  And cases soared as a result

1313222732050505728 2020-10-06 05:01:12 +0800 <SocialistAct> There are some who claim that Starmer is a continuity Corbynism leader - including some who should know better  Yet at every important test since he became leader Starmer has supported the Tories and done the opposite of what Corbyn would have done  Every important test
1313222132030205954 2020-10-06 04:58:49 +0800 <SocialistAct> You live in a police state when ministers, or senior cops or spy chiefs can decide what is legal and what isn't, whether to place their own agents above the law  You live in a police state
1313221338350473216 2020-10-06 04:55:40 +0800 <SocialistAct> There were many pundits who tried to insist that Boris Johnson was a liberal.  Bizarrely there are some who still claim it, even now

1313155911922450432 2020-10-06 00:35:41 +0800 <SocialistAct> This Labour leadership has no view, or at least no decisive position, on whether it is good or bad to make cops and security agents and their informers above the law.

1313013411542900736 2020-10-05 15:09:26 +0800 <SocialistAct> The police always targeted the anti-fascists in their confrontations with the British fascists  But eventually the anti-fascist movement was growing so rapidly and so militantly, Moseley's BUF were banned - to prevent the further growth of the anti-fascist alliance
1313011279460790274 2020-10-05 15:00:58 +0800 <SocialistAct> If there are civilians to be bombed in Yemen or #BlackLivesMatter  protesters to be attacked in USA, British firms and arms of the State are always there to help    https://t.co/W9L0wszqJo

1312857418167009280 2020-10-05 04:49:34 +0800 <SocialistAct> Seems as if Govt was suppressing the data on new cases, or at least not bothering to ensure they were properly collated  But now the virus is clearly out of control, Govt decides to release the suppressed cases  This disaster will get worse until they change policy
1312855790672379904 2020-10-05 04:43:06 +0800 <SocialistAct> Huge attack on living standards is being enacted - unless Tories are resisted  Austerity on steroids

1312678577666691073 2020-10-04 16:58:55 +0800 <SocialistAct> The government has failed on both public health and the economy because they tried to prioritise the needs of private business  But it turns out that doesn't work - people will not 'return to normal' during a pandemic  Saving lives &amp; the economy need the same policy - zero Covid

1308449296296095749 2020-09-23 00:53:16 +0800 <SocialistAct> Much better to have a #ZeroCovid strategy  6 to 8 weeks of full enforced lockdown  To eliminate the virus + trace, track &amp; isolate  As has happened in China, Cuba, New Zealand, Viet Nam
1308449294597357578 2020-09-23 00:53:16 +0800 <SocialistAct> Johnson's policy will lead to more infections, hospitalisations, long Covid cases and deaths  And it could last 6 months longer from now, almost a year altogether  Whose only prospect of success relies on the virus fading naturally - extremely unlikely going into winter

Trudeau's govt refused

1308372714571390977 2020-09-22 19:48:58 +0800 <SocialistAct> Plans for future policy demands are important  But the spread of the virus will wreck all plans unless and until it is suppressed  The economic crisis created by the failure to suppress the virus is being used to cloak a huge attack on workers and the poor already under way

1302534822556991489 2020-09-06 17:11:16 +0800 <SocialistAct> The idea there is a 'free press' in Britain is laughable  Free to say any racist, sexist, anti-refugee, anti-union, anti-Labour, climate change denial, pro-Empire, pro-US claptrap  A billionaire tax-dodging press for the billionaire tax dodgers

1301473712307351558 2020-09-03 18:54:47 +0800 <SocialistAct> The government is trying to force people back to work under a completely false pretext  Deaths are rising significantly once more  But the government cannot hide this for very long  Hospitals will re-fill, and deaths will rise to a level that won't be possible to hide
1301473709765652481 2020-09-03 18:54:47 +0800 <SocialistAct> The UK authorities have imposed a ridiculous 28-day cut-off for counting the latest deaths  So, on official data yesterday's official new deaths= 10  Real new deaths yesterday= 105   1/2
