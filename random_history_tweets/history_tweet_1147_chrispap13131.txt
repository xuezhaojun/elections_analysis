1321072099692302341 2020-10-27 20:51:47 +0800 <chrispap13131> Bottom line.  RBG should have retired under Obama.  He would have filled the seat and this would have never happened.  She took a chance and wanted to be on the bench when Clinton was elected as the first woman president.  Miscalculation.  That‚Äôs your problem.
