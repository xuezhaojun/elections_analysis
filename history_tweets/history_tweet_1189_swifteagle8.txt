1338284489034723330 2020-12-14 08:47:40 +0800 <swifteagle8> @BobLoukas I was listening to Fred Hickey, says the best 6 weeks for gold from a seasonality perspective is now.

1337520863218786305 2020-12-12 06:13:18 +0800 <swifteagle8> @TuurDemeester Tuur - see excerpt from JPM report this afternoon  https://t.co/WkVGYvDkeg

1334599740240093186 2020-12-04 04:45:48 +0800 <swifteagle8> @BobLoukas Does this make you think that the SPX IC will be LT?

1332384451360276480 2020-11-28 02:03:02 +0800 <swifteagle8> @AdamDraper @BoostVC Figure out how to get China and India to stop polluting so much?
1332380636246540288 2020-11-28 01:47:52 +0800 <swifteagle8> @blueshirt_sd Another reason for gold to find a floor soon
1332325861572284418 2020-11-27 22:10:13 +0800 <swifteagle8> @blueshirt_sd Agreed.  If you look at flows too, we are seeing some capitulation.

1331062438473605122 2020-11-24 10:29:49 +0800 <swifteagle8> @SantiagoAuFund Jay P has talked about how the Fed needs the fiscal side to step up.  IMO, bc she is one, Janet will play ball with the central bankers and we will get closer to MMT than otherwise

1305593315442733056 2020-09-15 03:44:37 +0800 <swifteagle8> @hodl_american Price would be unknown but a lot higher than $125k.
1305586267485335554 2020-09-15 03:16:37 +0800 <swifteagle8> @SGBarbour Wonâ€™t happen.  People are excited and buying into higher inflation is good.
1305225056801488896 2020-09-14 03:21:18 +0800 <swifteagle8> Crazy to think that one effective meme, which costs nothing, could counteract $100MM spent by Bloomberg.     https://t.co/WGbdyoAzL6

1304188105952571393 2020-09-11 06:40:49 +0800 <swifteagle8> @millerak42 Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m concerned about direct indexing, loss harvesting strategies. Even if trump wins again, looking at our massive debt/GDP, you would think tax rates will eventually be higher 5-10+ years out.
1304144651209846786 2020-09-11 03:48:09 +0800 <swifteagle8> @sunchartist what about inverse head and shoulders on the 4hr futures chart?

1303873701658664962 2020-09-10 09:51:29 +0800 <swifteagle8> @Pazoola @michaelbatnick The argument was to whether there was any risk and clearly there is.  And I do think FDIC will always payout, as the Fed would just create the money out of thin air like they did in March. But yes, I own gold and bitcoin.  No counterparty risk!
1303857754348630016 2020-09-10 08:48:07 +0800 <swifteagle8> @Pazoola @michaelbatnick So there is no risk at all? Why would the FDIC need to insure it then? How many federal programs are insolvent at the moment?
1303846694484877312 2020-09-10 08:04:10 +0800 <swifteagle8> @michaelbatnick What do you mean nothing?  Your capital is at risk in event of a failure.
