Dems have Dead ppl voting, ppl voting 25x each, and throwing away Trump votes. I saw all of this on vids that have been on Twitter all day, even on YouTube.

Maybe you should research that before giving your 2 cents. I saw a vid where a security guard walked right past a woman that was changing the ballots right in front of him. He did/said nothing. Ppl throwing away votes.

The contents on there expose Biden‚Äôs as a crime family, selling out US to China. Two ex business partners, as witnesses, corroborate the Facts. MSM is guilty of complete blackout disinformation campaign to bury the story. Gateway Pundit.
1321563587492630537 2020-10-29 05:24:47 +0800 <katiasense> @Liciarich @CBSNews Joe Biden is the most corrupt sell out US to China VP that has ever served. He‚Äôs a lifelong corrupt politician that never did a damn thing for anyone except made himself and family wealthy, at the American‚Äôs expense. Gateway Pundit.

Sex trafficking children, Natalie Biden (14yo) sexually abused by Hunter

He told me that until every aspect in my life was perfect, without flaw, then and only then, could I have any opinions on how others live. Imagine living in a world when we say kind things to one another instead of death wishes.

1312212639552991232 2020-10-03 10:07:27 +0800 <katiasense> @McBrosius Trump‚Äôs bro died. We do not know if his death was covid-19 related. Trump has said he‚Äôs lost family/friends to covid. He takes this seriously. I think mistaken leadership and not panicking for non caring is wrong. Projected death toll 2.5millon.200K is a lot 2.5million much more.
1312194965544476672 2020-10-03 08:57:13 +0800 <katiasense> @PhoenixWomanMN @hodgetwins @WorldsGonNuts Trump did not know he had it. And! More importantly, he would never knowingly pass this on/come in close contact with anyone. He‚Äôs tested  more than anyone in the USA.
1312194006550413312 2020-10-03 08:53:25 +0800 <katiasense> @nicejulie1994 @hodgetwins What sickens me, is the media not telling the truth. Biden wrote the most racist Bill in 1994 that locked blacks up for generations, yet he says Trump is racist. It‚Äôs mind blowing projection Biden uses daily against Trump with MSM help. Why more blacks support Trump than ever. ‚ù§Ô∏è

We have more freedoms with Trump in the WH, less-much less, with Biden. Biden wrote the 1994 Bill that locked up blacks for generations. There are more blacks/minorities voting for Trump, than any Republican has ever had, in US history.Real politics

He wrote the 1994 Bill that locked up blacks for generations, while saying that Trump is the racist. It‚Äôs just maddening and so wrongüòí

1312167362041323521 2020-10-03 07:07:32 +0800 <katiasense> @chrisgalea That‚Äôs why Trump is receiving so many black votes. They know the truth.
1312167017022070784 2020-10-03 07:06:10 +0800 <katiasense> @chrisgalea Biden is accused of the same..white men suck. Biden sucks more for his 1994 bill and lifelong racist stance for locking blacks up, separating them from families, for generations.
1312166487520505857 2020-10-03 07:04:04 +0800 <katiasense> @chrisgalea And! I would never vote for a well known factually based racist, that wrote the Bill 1994 that locked away blacks for generations, ruining their lives and their families lives, for decades. Harris used the same bill  to lock blacks up for pot. So, you do you.
1312164942137577480 2020-10-03 06:57:55 +0800 <katiasense> @chrisgalea If you are real. Please know that I only care about World peace and getting rid of sex trafficking for children and women, by which Trump is a champion for.
1312162651401719808 2020-10-03 06:48:49 +0800 <katiasense> @chrisgalea @seanhannity Imagine being in a race to help the American people and to help secure their freedoms stay intact instead of allowing the Dems take over every aspect of one‚Äôs freedoms.

Harris used the same law to lock blacks up for years, for using pot. Something she laughed about.
1312135377189130241 2020-10-03 05:00:26 +0800 <katiasense> @MTorganizer @Redistrict Nope! When Trump closed the borders, back in February, Biden called him racist.

1311515465135673345 2020-10-01 11:57:08 +0800 <katiasense> @nytimes Rewatch the debate. Biden first interrupted Trump. Then, the whole thing digressed...Biden calling Trump a clown, told him to shut up. Wallace did not have control of the debate. Wallace interrupted Trump 70+ times and Biden 16 times. Wallace was not biased that was obvious. #NYT

Most people are use to, status-quo career politicians. What I like to see is both parties coming together, for the greater good. I have not seen that from the Dems at all. They have been nasty towards Trump/his family from day one.

There was a professional vote harvester that admitted (undercover) that he had rigged elections for the DEMS for the past 20 years in CA, NY, and NJ. Sadly, it is a thing.

1300685237685428225 2020-09-01 14:41:40 +0800 <katiasense> @igorbobic I guess the days of actually gathering facts and having a trial are over. Public wants to be judge, jury, and executioner w/o knowing the facts.

Whatever they want, is still unknown, except for defunding the police; we need our police, and  Trump going to Kenosha, is a good move to try and help the healing.
1300640459715469313 2020-09-01 11:43:44 +0800 <katiasense> @PN_boro @ivegotconfidnce @realDonaldTrump The 17 year old, according to his attorney, after reviewing numerous videos, says he has a self defense case. I do not have a dog in this fight. However, I think allowing justice to prevail instead of public opinion will/should prevail. We have laws otherwise it‚Äôs anarchy.
1300635365913616385 2020-09-01 11:23:30 +0800 <katiasense> @PN_boro @ivegotconfidnce @realDonaldTrump Seeing vids of crimes w/o having all of the facts, and wanting instant justice via being judge, jury, and executioner. There are many facts about these crimes that we do not know. Getting shot 7 times in the back was horrible, and shouldn‚Äôt happen to anyone. Police reform, yes.
