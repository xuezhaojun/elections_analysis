I eventually voted for Trump as what I thought was the better of two evils.  I have grown to love Trump for standing up for the people and keeping his campaign promises.

1338885667510685697 2020-12-16 00:36:33 +0800 <MadPatriot65> @BreitbartNews What about all the elec. workers that saw fraud &amp; signed affidavits?  What about  the evidence of dead voters, double voters, bogus address voters, underage voters, illegal voters, &amp; algorithms weighting votes?  Investigate to assure us you are the duly elected President.

1338610653846761473 2020-12-15 06:23:44 +0800 <MadPatriot65> @RepsForBiden Sorry, but it all started with Democrat fraud in this and past elections.  It’s all coming out now. the election system is broken and the American people demand it be fixed! Verify signatures, audit the machines, clear review/clean up of voter rolls
1338609340085841920 2020-12-15 06:18:31 +0800 <MadPatriot65> @w8lifter22 @Rothbard1776 @realDonaldTrump NOW you want law and order? This is lawful, by the way.  Election results are contested - evidence exists. Enough fraudulent votes to change results.
1338608255455670274 2020-12-15 06:14:12 +0800 <MadPatriot65> @dbongino Doesn’t matter.  GOP electors still cast their vote for Trump, as they had the right to do - as the clear and rampant fraud in MI and other states is corrected.
1338607127519260673 2020-12-15 06:09:43 +0800 <MadPatriot65> @BGOnTheScene Once all the dead voters, fake address voters, double voters, illegal voters and dominion vote switching is corrected, Trump wins.  Truth will prevail.  Biden is not the duly elected President.
