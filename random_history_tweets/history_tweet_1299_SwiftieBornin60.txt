1310740578628497409 2020-09-29 08:38:00 +0800 <SwiftieBornin60> @Saylorrtwiftt Is Stella a terror? We got a kitten in August ‚ÄúScotia‚Äù and he is so funny but so bad. We are always on alert for a cat flying in the air around us. He will play with everything and pounce from the top of the couch to the table to the chair across the room. We are human cat trees.  https://t.co/Qk0YMz9JAH

1305814869229305860 2020-09-15 18:25:00 +0800 <SwiftieBornin60> @TSlifestyle13 1. If someone unfollows you because of your amazing tweet that @taylorswift13 liked and commented on, it is no loss to you. You do not need them as a follower.   2.  Congratulations, I am happy for you and so are many more. More importantly, you made Taylor, Jess, Blake ‚Äòs day.‚ù§Ô∏è

One of the best parts about being a Swiftie is meeting people from around the world on Twitter &amp; at concerts. Tell me which country you live in and show me an iconic photo at a landmark from your country.
