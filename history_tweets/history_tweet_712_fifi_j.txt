The 'pyrrhic victory' of WW1 which was the Brothers War to end all others, &amp; convincing the British ppl that a massive victory had been achieved, despite the cost &amp; loss of virtually a whole generation of young men, was the first step.

1338096602238644224 2020-12-13 20:21:05 +0800 <fifi_j> @Grumps_MH That's one thing I have got right lol
1338095963131551745 2020-12-13 20:18:32 +0800 <fifi_j> @stubow1973 Nah. I think #TreasonMay was considered a safe pair of hands but she fucked up. Bojo has always been a loose cannon, but with the ability to convince the plebs he was a born again Brexiteer. Unfortunately many of us are equally aware he's a compulsive liar &amp; a globalist stooge.
1338094053481656321 2020-12-13 20:10:57 +0800 <fifi_j> @Firewoodturning Nah. It's all bread and circuses.  My prediction: A 'last minute deal' which has already been decided. With or without a beautiful bow on it, de Pfeffel will temporarily be regarded as 'The Second Coming'   https://t.co/K9NF3BQTXU
1338091424798175235 2020-12-13 20:00:30 +0800 <fifi_j> @Firewoodturning Indeed. But on this particular point I'm referring to delivering on the result of the referendum.
1338090500172046340 2020-12-13 19:56:50 +0800 <fifi_j> The Tories 'sold out' over 4 years ago. The day after the referendum, in fact.

1337807013863182336 2020-12-13 01:10:22 +0800 <fifi_j> @GreenSerpentini Indeed I do. Utterly horrendous.
1337806666839035911 2020-12-13 01:08:59 +0800 <fifi_j> @AQuantumCat1 Who in their right mind would want to impregnate them after this. Utterly abhorrent &amp; heartbreaking that a child's life can be snuffed out, like a candle, with barely a passing thought 💔
1337804785647575040 2020-12-13 01:01:30 +0800 <fifi_j> Whilst so-called 'toxic masculinity' is in fact a gift from God, 'toxic feminism' comes straight from the synagogue of satan.

1335679620520275970 2020-12-07 04:16:51 +0800 <fifi_j> Welcome to my grotto 🎄 Some new decorations this year.  #Christmas  https://t.co/0494DPfpqw
1335677323237056512 2020-12-07 04:07:44 +0800 <fifi_j> @LagudV @Conservatives A lot of people did. And, given the chance will do it again ad nauseam.  Which is why we need seismic political revolution.  Sadly, I think it's too late now. Under global communism GEs aren't permitted, in my understanding.
1335675204526362629 2020-12-07 03:59:19 +0800 <fifi_j> @TruthbeatsLies Quite. And, let's face it, look where it's got us!
1335674408896253952 2020-12-07 03:56:09 +0800 <fifi_j> @LagudV @Conservatives We're going round in circles. Brexit is a side issue, I'm afraid. As I keep saying, we're on the cusp of global communism right now. Under a Tory government.
1335673324291166210 2020-12-07 03:51:50 +0800 <fifi_j> @evanwoolcock64 @Conservatives Read the convo and then ask a sensible question please.
1335672728335110145 2020-12-07 03:49:28 +0800 <fifi_j> @LagudV @Conservatives The vast majority of them spoilt their ballot papers. I was one of them. Only faux right wingers vote Tory.
1335671626772475909 2020-12-07 03:45:06 +0800 <fifi_j> @LagudV @Conservatives Right wing???????  Don't make me laugh.
1335669871816937473 2020-12-07 03:38:07 +0800 <fifi_j> @LagudV @Conservatives And this is the basis of British politics? Voting for someone in the vague hope they'll be 10% better than the opposition? The Tories have taken us to the brink of global communism ffs. Pitiful. This country should DEMAND better.
1335668454570029057 2020-12-07 03:32:29 +0800 <fifi_j> @410MLXVI @TruthbeatsLies Nah!
1335668071357362178 2020-12-07 03:30:58 +0800 <fifi_j> @410MLXVI Wtf? Thankfully I don't follow any of them lol
1335666755964899328 2020-12-07 03:25:44 +0800 <fifi_j> @LagudV @Conservatives And they will STILL continue to vote Conservative regardless. Which is the point I'm trying to make. Voting DOESN'T make any difference. It's quite clear. The nation needs to STOP now. Spoil our ballot papers and DEMAND change. Sadly it'll NEVER happen. So we're fucked.
1335665011381989377 2020-12-07 03:18:48 +0800 <fifi_j> @LagudV @Conservatives If you think the Tories are gonna deliver the Brexit we voted for you're deluded, my friend.
1335664199939317761 2020-12-07 03:15:35 +0800 <fifi_j> @northsAce @LagudV @Conservatives Exactly! Democracy is an absolute sham under our current political system.
1335663627022569472 2020-12-07 03:13:18 +0800 <fifi_j> @RealBlackIrish @LagudV @Conservatives Exactly.
1335663269873324032 2020-12-07 03:11:53 +0800 <fifi_j> @LagudV @Conservatives Why did ppl vote for the Tories? One things for sure it wasn't for a Bolshevik takeover. At least with Labour, you know pretty much what you're voting for. CONs constantly lie &amp; deceive yet their tribal supporters keep voting for them. They even conned former Labour supporters.

Or are people just getting dumbed down by the regularity of it all. Either way, the UK can no longer call itself a civilised country. And our politicians need lynching.

1330432543783596033 2020-11-22 16:46:51 +0800 <fifi_j> My Twitter story's very similar. Binned facebook 7 years ago for exactly the same reasons. Brexit seduced me into giving Twitter another go and I've never looked back. Have made some amazing friends, too, during the past 5 years.  Twitter's still cying out for an edit button tho!

It's heartbreaking that this wholesale abuse of our elderly is common place today as a direct result of government legislation. It's criminal that it's allowed to continue. Ultimately, this government must be held to account for their inhumanity.

1328013524648517634 2020-11-16 00:34:32 +0800 <fifi_j> @PupspurJeanette @DouglasKMurray Thank you. Apologies for my initial reaction, but hopefully you can now see where I was coming from.
1328013251830050816 2020-11-16 00:33:27 +0800 <fifi_j> So you lock us in our houses, close our gyms and subject us to endless takeaways.  You constantly tweet nonsense. Please delete your account.
1328011937746210818 2020-11-16 00:28:13 +0800 <fifi_j> @PupspurJeanette @DouglasKMurray I get your point.  But why's he putting out deliberately misleading information?  If he's going to denounce them, then it's imperative he gets his facts right.

1328010564833075206 2020-11-16 00:22:46 +0800 <fifi_j> @PupspurJeanette @DouglasKMurray Ergo I was not criticising Murray per se, but taking him to task over a deliberately misleading comment.  I would actually very much like to know why @DouglasKMurray tweeted this.
1328009511911759873 2020-11-16 00:18:35 +0800 <fifi_j> @PupspurJeanette @DouglasKMurray Antifa are not fascists, they are bolsheviks.  Douglas Murray is far too intelligent not to know the difference. And I would expect the vast majority of my followers to be the same.  Perhaps you now understand why I was so shocked by your question.

The sooner we're rid of them the better.  I was referring to decisions UK governments made in the 1930s &amp; 1940s. The implications of which have had devastating consequences for UK &amp; its ppl.

An offshoot of the 'EU Army' to keep dissidents in check. Same happening in London under current two tier police system.

1327553163231170561 2020-11-14 18:05:13 +0800 <fifi_j> @cornwall70001 Really? Doesn't look that way to many who  predicted a Tory stitch up from the onset. After 5 years my patience is wearing v thin. The comparison is not personal, but completely valid nevertheless.  My children's future is being ruined by nothing less than deluded herd mentality.
1327551346824925184 2020-11-14 17:58:00 +0800 <fifi_j> @cornwall70001 Which is your prerogative.  Very few agreed with me when I stated this during initial Brexit negotiations &amp; look where we are now.  I'm not on here to force my opinions down peoples'  threats but to encourage them to engage in critical thought.  A rare commodity these days.

A fair indicator of the contempt many Tory MPs (inc Steve Baker) had for the so-called democratic process, which we recognise has always been a sham. Tribal Tory sheep loved it though, Farage too.

1326832438467842049 2020-11-12 18:21:19 +0800 <fifi_j> @MPfenig The Harkles are a more fitting comparison imo.

With the world on the brink of #globocommunism  it's incredibly misleading to attempt a comparison between either. Look at the ideologies &amp; indeed the death count of both. There's really no comparison.

1326228010048040966 2020-11-11 02:19:32 +0800 <fifi_j> @EternalEnglish I'm sure we'll find some of the usual suspects are heavily involved.

1326158046024912896 2020-11-10 21:41:31 +0800 <fifi_j> @EdB61 Changes to sovereignty were made in the 1973 declaration. The start of the process, if you like.
1326157505114873856 2020-11-10 21:39:22 +0800 <fifi_j> @EdB61 We need to track back to the 1973 declaration where the process of signing over sovereignty began. Followed by the 2007 Lisbon Treaty and of course Maastricht. I saved some highlighted clauses together with comprehensive info on You Tube but am unable to access them at the mo.

1325876372179398656 2020-11-10 03:02:15 +0800 <fifi_j> @EdB61 The wording of the WA as it stands.
1325875490650017793 2020-11-10 02:58:45 +0800 <fifi_j> @EdB61 @TheBernician Indeed.   The crown will always be there as a matter of protocol.  But the pressing question really is who is actually sovereign?

1325870679175143425 2020-11-10 02:39:38 +0800 <fifi_j> @EdB61 @TheBernician Yeah but the incident in question took place at the Queen's speech post election in December. In November she wore full royal regalia. In December, in relatively short succession, she wore civvies. I remember it. My gut feeling then was that something dramatic may have happened.

1325862500257116173 2020-11-10 02:07:08 +0800 <fifi_j> @EdB61 @TheBernician Thanks, Ed. I've seen this but, it doesn't appear to be directly related to her last Queen's speech.  Unless I'm having a blonde moment....

1325785817621684225 2020-11-09 21:02:25 +0800 <fifi_j> @EdB61 @TheBernician I'll leave you with this thought.....  Where were the trappings of state when Elizabeth Ii made her last Queeen's Speech in parliament?  She no longer wore a crown.  It really can't get any more symbolic than that.

1325429116821254150 2020-11-08 21:25:01 +0800 <fifi_j> @LagudV Fair point. But her devotion to the monarchy has been second to none. She's flatly refused to abdicate in favour of her moronic son, who, let's face it, has been a constant disappointment. It very much like her spirit has finally broken. Something seismic must have caused it imo.

1325010024314392579 2020-11-07 17:39:41 +0800 <fifi_j> @realquell @TheBernician Indeed. All of which was noted at the time. But largely ignored coz I'm an 'unhinged conspiracy' theorist!

1324792481561649152 2020-11-07 03:15:15 +0800 <fifi_j> Don't be so sure.  It'll probably take that long to announce the winner of #USAelection2020  And, as Britain will be communist by then, they'll be no elections here.

1324672247634821126 2020-11-06 19:17:29 +0800 <fifi_j> @Pjreid10 If everyone chose to ignore the ridiculous &amp; increasingly hysterical hype this could be sorted within hours.  How can anyone condone electoral fraud in plain sight.  What an example the 'Land of the Free' is setting to the world!
1324670990287314944 2020-11-06 19:12:29 +0800 <fifi_j> @Pjreid10 Only it 'we' let it.
1324667992781824001 2020-11-06 19:00:35 +0800 <fifi_j> And we, the people are its stooges.  The butt of every bad joke our politicians come up with on behalf of their globalist overlords.

1324631858580230146 2020-11-06 16:37:00 +0800 <fifi_j> USA sort your shit out. It's getting embarrassing....  #Election2020
1324631074878738432 2020-11-06 16:33:53 +0800 <fifi_j> @zero_to_here_oh Remember the brutal thuggery thrown at the #GiletsJaunes  &amp; the Catalans? Well it's here now. And I have the strongest suspicion so-called 'EU defence cooperation' is at the heart of it.

1324492220406386691 2020-11-06 07:22:07 +0800 <fifi_j> @GreggatQuest Yeah. I think tonight could be a turning point, but for what I'm unsure.

1324490678999621632 2020-11-06 07:16:00 +0800 <fifi_j> @EternalEnglish @VonPilsner Without a doubt. I wonder if its that energy I'm feeling? I really don't know.
1324490398908243975 2020-11-06 07:14:53 +0800 <fifi_j> @JennaJJameson1 I genuinely can't tell whether it's good or bad. But I feel sure that something BIG is about to go down. It might be something relating to the US election, though that hasn't been forefront in my mind.
1324489641421144065 2020-11-06 07:11:52 +0800 <fifi_j> @EternalEnglish @VonPilsner Exactly! An absolute patsy.
1324489441537413121 2020-11-06 07:11:05 +0800 <fifi_j> @VaughanEvans7 @EternalEnglish Without a doubt.
1324488999180947460 2020-11-06 07:09:19 +0800 <fifi_j> @EternalEnglish @VonPilsner Yeah, but are they forces for good as so many people believe. The guy keeps talking about vaxx ffs!
1324488603523833858 2020-11-06 07:07:45 +0800 <fifi_j> @VonPilsner @EternalEnglish I'm not convinced. God knows I've tried. But I do know Biden will be an absolute disaster.
1324488412607533057 2020-11-06 07:07:00 +0800 <fifi_j> @EternalEnglish Potentially when they're at their most dangerous though.
1324487865049485314 2020-11-06 07:04:49 +0800 <fifi_j> @Wolska20 Very much so.
1324487547590946817 2020-11-06 07:03:33 +0800 <fifi_j> @EternalEnglish @VonPilsner Absolutely. What worries me though is how far-reaching the tentacles of the deep state are.
1324486761314193414 2020-11-06 07:00:26 +0800 <fifi_j> @EternalEnglish I don't think mine's got anything to do with the US election, but I'll take that on board.
1324486288804896770 2020-11-06 06:58:33 +0800 <fifi_j> @JennaJJameson1 Personally, I'm experiencing a very intense gut feeling. But not sure why. Just tweeted to see if anyone else feels the same.
1324485622787178496 2020-11-06 06:55:54 +0800 <fifi_j> Is it just me? Or has anyone else got an intensely strong gut feeling that certain forces are at work tonight? Though I'm as yet unsure sure whether for they're for good or evil.  https://t.co/kTeo7Bk0ZK
1324482924205531138 2020-11-06 06:45:11 +0800 <fifi_j> @PeterTownsend2 Tbf democracy has been a sham for decades. It's all been leading to this.
1324482422298177537 2020-11-06 06:43:11 +0800 <fifi_j> @JennaJJameson1 Thanks, yes, that explains it. There's something going on tonight that I can't quantify.

1324410740435017728 2020-11-06 01:58:21 +0800 <fifi_j> What's the point of this article? Just as in the UK, successive French politicians have facilitated the global swarming of incompatible cultures &amp; globalist Macron is no exception. Migrants doing exactly what they're imported to do.  And I'm sure the French weren't asked either.

1324064176843739140 2020-11-05 03:01:14 +0800 <fifi_j> @Pjreid10 Sadly so. It's a global takeover.
1324063277882761217 2020-11-05 02:57:40 +0800 <fifi_j> @Pjreid10 Inevitable, I'm afraid, given the state of this country.

1324058808201654273 2020-11-05 02:39:54 +0800 <fifi_j> Pitiful.  It will take a lot more than one vote to vindicate any of the 650 professional traitors in our parliament.  If they were the heroes you claim, UK would not be sitting on the cusp of Bolshevism. Which under a Tory government, I'm sure you'll agree, is positively obscene.
1324054109591347200 2020-11-05 02:21:14 +0800 <fifi_j> And, not for the first time, I reiterate to my local MP @chhcalling, you're a self-serving traitor who deserves everything that's heading in your direction. #ToryScum
1324053226627485697 2020-11-05 02:17:43 +0800 <fifi_j> Are we supposed to be impressed by this?  For as usual any CONservative 'rebellion' is beyond pitiful, including today's vote. Which was piss poor to say the least.  Relentlessly we're allowing ourselves to be driven in the direction of global communism  #PartyBeforeCountryAlways

1324016847923105792 2020-11-04 23:53:10 +0800 <fifi_j> @zeropoint618 Exactly this. And what's even worse is that a significant percentage of the sheeple have already swallowed it 🙄
1324010390448152577 2020-11-04 23:27:30 +0800 <fifi_j> And this is news? WHY?
1324006162363305984 2020-11-04 23:10:42 +0800 <fifi_j> @TruthbeatsLies Oh absolutely. Still constantly referred to as a 'White Supremacist' by MSM though. Batshit crazy times.
1324003572317622273 2020-11-04 23:00:25 +0800 <fifi_j> @TruthbeatsLies Would certainly have made the Dems' cheating less of a formality.

Thereby losing every ounce of credibility she ever had.  So not a good example tbh as I'm sure her faith is the last thing that will come between herself and her brother.

1323286165798215686 2020-11-02 23:29:42 +0800 <fifi_j> @ElfieGoldbergi1 I've tried it. Sadly it works. White babies no longer exist in Google's warped world.
1323285527697756160 2020-11-02 23:27:09 +0800 <fifi_j> @suzseddon @Philip3157 Exactly! Who the fuck does she think she is. Her face personifies EVERYTHING that's wrong with the NHS.
1323279575531610112 2020-11-02 23:03:30 +0800 <fifi_j> @NeilClark66 Sadly, I think we know the answer.

1323268313162665986 2020-11-02 22:18:45 +0800 <fifi_j> Awww diddums. I find it totally obscene that so many MPs are, not only millionaires but also completely unfit for service, including your husband btw. As public servants, they're paid far too much to largely feather their own nests &amp; further their own interests.  #DrainTheSwampUK  https://t.co/YcnPLElBPT

1323042797172260864 2020-11-02 07:22:38 +0800 <fifi_j> @realhansard @PatAlternative The perfect RH summation lol The issue here though isn't really the manifesto. It's the current corrupt parliamentary system based on divisive, tribal politics which have increasingly revealed 'democracy' to be but a thinly veiled illusion.  #LibLabCon cheeks of the same arse!
1323031285770653696 2020-11-02 06:36:53 +0800 <fifi_j> @realhansard @PatAlternative Fair enough.  However, purely judging by what the Tories offered as opposed to what they've actually delivered so far (i.e. bringing us to the brink of global communism) I think this manifesto has the potential to be even more workable, even as it stands.
1323028986012774400 2020-11-02 06:27:45 +0800 <fifi_j> TWITTER POLL  Now it's November the question is when's it socially acceptable to start bombarding our eardrums with Christmas music 🎅  A particularly poignant subject this year as Christmas itself could well be under threat thanks to the crooks who govern us.

With our current political system corrupt to the core &amp; not fit for purpose, seismic politic revolution is our only choice.  With that in mind, however, I'm far from convinced that Farage is the man to drive it forward.

The divisive politics of #LibLabCon have ensured we've been at each other's throats for decades.

Very aware of false flags &amp; open to the idea that this may well be another. Muslims are pawns in the game as much as we are. They're useful because, by it's very nature, islam is perceived as the antithesis to western civilisation.

Combined with decades of cultural marxist brainwashing, the use of such anti-white dogma has been instrumental in setting a course whereby we become minorities within our own homeland.

Thanks for reminding me, it's now saved for posterity &amp; frequent viewing, I suspect!  Such dystopian themes were clearly ahead of their time &amp; feel disturbingly relevant in 2020.

1320353994351529984 2020-10-25 21:18:17 +0800 <fifi_j> Much better news on the non mask front at Children's Soft Play Hub where I've been today.

1320099885140611075 2020-10-25 04:28:33 +0800 <fifi_j> @EdB61 I find focussing on positives tends to help keep one's spirits lifted. It's all too easy to go into a downward spiral. Where would you go, anyway? The whole world's pretty much fucked.

Quite deliberately of course for exactly this reason. However, when the true extent of the Tory's treachery &amp; indeed their democide is revealed, I wouldn't underestimate the white hot anger which will inevitably result.

Like I said, NOTHING will change until the current parliamentary system is torn asunder &amp; replaced. By force, if necessary. With UK on the cusp of global communism future elections are in doubt, anyway. And all this under a Tory government 🙄

An 80 seat majority's an absolute disaster if it results in increasingly autocratic governance, working against the interests of the British ppl.

Largely because the current political system is corrupt to the core &amp; not fit for purpose. Seismic political revolution is the only answer. Because the sheeple will continue to vote for LibLabCon regardless &amp; nothing will change. In fact, things will get decidedly worse.

1317402446801653761 2020-10-17 17:49:54 +0800 <fifi_j> @ds13_manon @realquell @thismorning is perfect viewing material for all those morons (of which there are far too many) content to sleep walk their way to oblivion. Its vapid content reduces what's left of their brains to mush, thus making their inevitable demise seem like a merciful release.
1317398054706810880 2020-10-17 17:32:26 +0800 <fifi_j> @realquell As that programme oozes vacuous and banal rubbish, it's a distinct possibility that they write the scripts. Who could possibly want a cardigan that's spent most of its life rubbing up against Hammond's minge ffs! lol
1317385119485788162 2020-10-17 16:41:02 +0800 <fifi_j> When it's becoming clearer every day that diversity is actually destroying Britain, the powers-that-be decide to issue a coin to celebrate it 🤔  Are you getting it yet?

1317209787021623298 2020-10-17 05:04:20 +0800 <fifi_j> @BellaBeStrange Indeed!
1317209405117599744 2020-10-17 05:02:49 +0800 <fifi_j> Yup. Just like his idol, Churchill.
1317207905322569729 2020-10-17 04:56:51 +0800 <fifi_j> About time you sheeple woke up to the fact that Brexit is providing the perfect distraction from UK's descent into global communism. Probably the only time in his life BJ's been remotely honest. But then, it's an elite trait to provide clues in advance of their evil intentions...

In reality he's a narcissist who's probably both thick and complicit at the same time imho. None of which are a good look!  This Brexit bull is nothing but a distraction technique.
1317190171452911623 2020-10-17 03:46:23 +0800 <fifi_j> @Charbrevolution @HappyBigGrin Thank you! What an honest &amp; interesting interview. You spoke so much sense, as you always do.  So sorry about the abuse you received. It's crazy that these morons direct their anger at the freedom fighters rather than the gov who is actually abusing them.  #IStandWithCharisse

1317170619629305856 2020-10-17 02:28:42 +0800 <fifi_j> A pretty big advantage if you don't mind me saying so!   And also probably why the tinpot tyrants are doing everything they can to keep us away.  All I know is, being by the sea soothes my soul. And that's good enough for me.
1317127869785571329 2020-10-16 23:38:49 +0800 <fifi_j> @9casey99 No one was more passionate about Brexit than I. But the crisis we are facing right now renders it as mere frippery in comparison.  #GloboCommunism #NWO

1316752133350359042 2020-10-15 22:45:47 +0800 <fifi_j> @RajLionxThreads Nevertheless it still comes as a life-changing shock when all the pieces of the evil jigsaw finally fit into place.  Furthermore, today's events only add credence to the abhorrent 'evil genius' of the devil's work we have uncovered along the way.
1316750227504877569 2020-10-15 22:38:12 +0800 <fifi_j> @RajLionxThreads Yep. Only been active on Twitter for the past 5 years &amp; indeed Brexit was my main motivation for hanging out on here. I've been lucky enough to follow some awesome accounts who've completely opened my eyes &amp; pointed me in the right direction to address questions I already had.
1316741971592044546 2020-10-15 22:05:24 +0800 <fifi_j> @RajLionxThreads Will post this while I can. And urge others to do the same.  The first thing any genuine free thinker should query is WHY it's a criminal offence throughout most of Europe to question a significant event in our shared history. It always bugged me long before I was redpilled.

1315962123751755777 2020-10-13 18:26:34 +0800 <fifi_j> @Ciolfilicious1 Face it, barbarity like FGM is now common practice in this country because it's part of the culture of the third worlders our government insist on importing en masse.  This would be no different if this tribe came here. We would forced to  turn a blind eye coz 'racist' otherwise.

1315958952912474113 2020-10-13 18:13:58 +0800 <fifi_j> @Ciolfilicious1 Positively depraved, but apparently part of their culture. So perfectly acceptable behaviour to them. And if they did it here our gov would probably tolerate it too.
1315958371716079618 2020-10-13 18:11:39 +0800 <fifi_j> @sylviamcc123 Of course we consider it depraved but it's  part of their culture.

But ultimately Good v Evil Christianity v The Synagogue of Satan  We lost, btw, which is becoming terrifying more apparent by the day.

1314958723182460929 2020-10-10 23:59:25 +0800 <fifi_j> @rfstyle69 OK - I get your point. I didn't interpret it as that as I don't necessarily see possessions as material things, but that's just me lol
1314958215189336065 2020-10-10 23:57:23 +0800 <fifi_j> @TennyTennison2 So sorry to hear that. You're between a rock and a hard place. Will they also insist on Covid vaxx?

1314952095326441476 2020-10-10 23:33:04 +0800 <fifi_j> I have it on very good authority that this is almost at epidemic proportions among certain Eastern Europeans who have no respect for our laws and culture. Illegal aliens, who've already broken our laws to get here will probably be even worse.  #CulturalEnrichment

1314619991115862016 2020-10-10 01:33:24 +0800 <fifi_j> @SimonZN66 @_Eng1ish Britain accepts all cultures, almost without exception, at the cost of disadvantaging our own. The adage 'When in Rome' does not apply one iota. We are forced to sacrifice OUR ways to make others welcome.  I think in France you do things a bit differently. Better, in fact.
1314617567466708993 2020-10-10 01:23:47 +0800 <fifi_j> @_Eng1ish @SimonZN66 Without a doubt. On the odd occasion that I use public transport I feel like a stranger in my own country.

I know of colleagues who've gone to them for money advice. They know every trick in the book.  And if it's not nailed down, they'll nick it.  Most distasteful.

1314610000506097664 2020-10-10 00:53:43 +0800 <fifi_j> @_Eng1ish @SimonZN66 Their countries are enjoying a higher standard of living &amp; are getting rich at OUR expense. We pay for kids who often do not even live here. Fucking madness. It needs to stop.

1314180636731731968 2020-10-08 20:27:34 +0800 <fifi_j> I've bookmarked this tweet. Safe in the knowledge that 'in about ten days from now' you'll still be the joke you always have been &amp; always will be. Most Conservatives are evil. But you're the exception. Thick as mince.  Unfortunately the end result's exactly the same.  #Scamdemic

1314166789031563264 2020-10-08 19:32:33 +0800 <fifi_j> @VobeShy Thank you. My kids' future means everything to me. I did not bring them into the world for them to succumb to digital serfdom and debt slavery. I despise EVERYONE responsible for where we are right now. I may forgive but I will NEVER forget.
1314165191681204224 2020-10-08 19:26:12 +0800 <fifi_j> @VobeShy Certainly can't disagree with you there. But remember, we're dealing with an utterly corrupt establishment, this is not simply confined to the political class. Mass non-compliance is the way forward. We need to give ppl the strength, self-belief &amp; confidence to take this path.
1314163866209845248 2020-10-08 19:20:56 +0800 <fifi_j> @VobeShy With all due respect, this isn't going to stop them.

1313189563234422784 2020-10-06 02:49:24 +0800 <fifi_j> @AQuantumCat1 @ArcherOnTheWall Wouldn't be remotely surprised. I've been to several committals at MK Crem but that venue doesn't look remotely familiar. Unless it's recently had a drastic makeover.
1313184184299552769 2020-10-06 02:28:01 +0800 <fifi_j> @ArcherOnTheWall The perfect opportunity for the mourners to show solidarity with the grieving widow &amp; kick this jobsworth bully into touch. That they couldn't find the courage  to do so really doesn't bode well  There's no doubt whatsoever in my mind what my family would have done &amp; many others

1313067305220411398 2020-10-05 18:43:35 +0800 <fifi_j> @9casey99 Of course there's also an arguement to be made that some people haven't got a soul to sell.  Ironically they're generally found in the higher pay scale.  Politicians, for example 🙄
1313059665769570305 2020-10-05 18:13:14 +0800 <fifi_j> So true.  50 quid though? What an insult 🤬

1312811147867942932 2020-10-05 01:45:43 +0800 <fifi_j> Only because divisive tribal politics is preventing our country uniting against a common enemy.  One that the vast majority don't even realise exists.  #LibLabConCabal
1312809663663140865 2020-10-05 01:39:49 +0800 <fifi_j> Absolutely right.  There are no benefits whatsoever because we haven't left.  #ToryTraitors

They really need to wake up and smell the coffee. The so-called 'leaving' celebrations were an absolute sham, as many of us commented at the time.

A tad on the sweet side for some, but a lovely refreshing alcoholic beverage nonetheless. Highly recommended. Let me know if you manage to source some.

1312460474898767872 2020-10-04 02:32:16 +0800 <fifi_j> Why so surprised?! I'm well-read and do my research.  Democide is not only applicable to the current Covid scam, successive British governments have been killing off old people for decades.  My father was one of them 💔
1312399539903528961 2020-10-03 22:30:08 +0800 <fifi_j> @d_mos77 Indeed. You're a true tigress with regard to your young. That's exactly how it should be.  #LoveYours
1312398846362873858 2020-10-03 22:27:22 +0800 <fifi_j> @3rdPositionKeri I'm in love with him already 😍 lol
1312397863427678210 2020-10-03 22:23:28 +0800 <fifi_j> @d_mos77 It's the result of relentless state-sponsored #fearporn hitting the spot every time. I find it incredible that parents are SO terrified of non compliance that they're prepared to risk the health of their kids. It's completely alien to every fibre of my being and yours, I'm sure.
1312395475719520259 2020-10-03 22:13:59 +0800 <fifi_j> @grumpytrooper @PeakyOswald Unfortunately will continue for as long as the people allow it to.  Compliance = collusion at the present time.  Utterly heartbreaking 💔
1312392299003940868 2020-10-03 22:01:21 +0800 <fifi_j> @grumpytrooper @PeakyOswald As a parent I pray this is the case, but if you look at how much the world &amp; our perception of it has changed in the past 6 months I genuinely fear that anything is possible right now. Particularly a satanic practice which is allegedly commonplace among so many of the elites.
1312388618552569856 2020-10-03 21:46:44 +0800 <fifi_j> @grumpytrooper @PeakyOswald Paedophilia is only a decade or so behind LGBT.  #PIE was introduced in the 80s, I think, which was around  the time the normalisation of this heinous practice began to gain traction 🤬
1312383525958701056 2020-10-03 21:26:30 +0800 <fifi_j> @EC2man Unbridled joy, arrogance and smugness.  What an altogether distasteful combination.

1312356311363981313 2020-10-03 19:38:21 +0800 <fifi_j> @CllrBSilvester Always good to have a bit of perspective Cllr
1312349011177766912 2020-10-03 19:09:21 +0800 <fifi_j> Which, totally unironically, involves the entire population undergoing mandatory muzzling which substantially increases their CO2 intake.  Which can lead to death in extreme cases, &amp; at best the total breakdown of the human immune system.  It's actually got a name - democide.
1312338373613420544 2020-10-03 18:27:04 +0800 <fifi_j> @realhansard Civil disobedience &amp; mass abstinence requires the country to unite under one banner. Which is impossible under the devisive politics of LibLabCon.  So we're actually between a rock and a hard place.  Pass me the dynamite....

Admittedly the mask to non mask ratio's gone up which is quite depressing, but there was generally more interaction in the store than previously. More a feeling empathy rather than contempt. I hope more will unmask as a result.

1311598083688615938 2020-10-01 17:25:26 +0800 <fifi_j> @Yotboyo The husbandry of free range chicken is a feature on all the farms with which I'm currently familiar.
1311596372223819777 2020-10-01 17:18:38 +0800 <fifi_j> @AvonandsomerRob I entirely concur.
1311595429067476992 2020-10-01 17:14:53 +0800 <fifi_j> @Yotboyo I have kept horses at livery on various working farms for most of my life.  One of my cousins also happens to be a farmer.  So CURRENTLY still very much involved in the farming fraternity.
1311592412112969728 2020-10-01 17:02:53 +0800 <fifi_j> @Yotboyo You clearly know nothing about farming.

He'd not done a thing for 6 years as the previous owners were scared of him, so relatively low mileage for his age. He's changed beyond all recognition! He was an affiliated showjumper in Wales in his youth.

1310148390529970176 2020-09-27 17:24:52 +0800 <fifi_j> Completely impossible now it's proven that the UK political system is corrupt to the core, not fit for purpose &amp; totally irreparable. Continuing to work within this system strongly indicates nothing more than controlled opposition, as our country cries out for much needed change.

We live in an age when part of the England Football Captain's modus operandi is to lay himself wide open to ritual humiliation.   As if taking the  knee for BLM wasn't humiliating enough 🙄
