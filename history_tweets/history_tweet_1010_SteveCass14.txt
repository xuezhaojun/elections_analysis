1344011015214788610 2020-12-30 04:02:51 +0800 <SteveCass14> Your tweet should be a statement of the bleeding obvious. I wonder why it isn't seen that way by so many? Worrying!
1344005387473854464 2020-12-30 03:40:29 +0800 <SteveCass14> With what we know now, is it unreasonable to expect the Gov to be assessing the longer-term impact of lockdowns against any short-term benefits lockdown are supposed to bring? And having done that, make the best decisions overall &amp; for the future not just for the next few months?
1344003589715488779 2020-12-30 03:33:20 +0800 <SteveCass14> Not to mention their impecable human rights record!
1343999613783695361 2020-12-30 03:17:32 +0800 <SteveCass14> You can ask that question about any historical writing prior to recording technology. Anyone could write whatever they liked about whatever they liked and it was largely down to luck as to whether it gained traction or not. All depended on the influence &amp; biases of the writer.
1343662035066888201 2020-12-29 04:56:07 +0800 <SteveCass14> You, Andrew? Wrong? Never!
1343610668386312203 2020-12-29 01:32:01 +0800 <SteveCass14> Of course. Studying abroad, whether free or not, is not only a 1st world issue but a middle class and above 1st world issue.
1343597887880622081 2020-12-29 00:41:13 +0800 <SteveCass14> Why is it that the more extremist the view, the more think-skinned they are?
1343597530802696192 2020-12-29 00:39:48 +0800 <SteveCass14> Every life matters &amp; I wish covid wasn't here. To answer your question, it's for the same reason we don't let victims decide the criminal sentences. They are naturally subjective in their view. Gov policy needs to see all the issues, &amp; policy has to be for the future not just now
1343595581441191937 2020-12-29 00:32:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> You've done a lot to keep spirits up over the last 9 months Andrew - thanks!!
1343594766433398788 2020-12-29 00:28:49 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣🤣🤣
1343538486050250757 2020-12-28 20:45:11 +0800 <SteveCass14> I prefer to say that intelligence doesn't equal wisdom. In simple terms, wisdom is 'good judgement'. So a level of intelligence is required and education should help (depending on what you've been taught) but good judgement/wisdom is NOT the same as either education or IQ levels.
1343531853861548033 2020-12-28 20:18:50 +0800 <SteveCass14> No sane or decent person that's for sure!
1343525714243579905 2020-12-28 19:54:26 +0800 <SteveCass14> Of course not and we know why. It's not about slavery per se, it's about relatively wealthy guilt-ridden (why?) white people self-flagellating in a belief that it gives them some form of atonement. It's a psychological therapy being forced on the rest of us.
1343471258747482118 2020-12-28 16:18:03 +0800 <SteveCass14> True. You could also say that fighting racism with equal &amp; opposite racism, which is basically what he is promoting, is doomed to failure. Angry bitter people need to be kept away from education because they can't stop themselves indoctrinating their anger &amp; bitterness.
1343468825635934209 2020-12-28 16:08:23 +0800 <SteveCass14> I don't get why so many comfortable middle-class folk feel better about themselves putting out a nasty negative tweet like this. Pathetic.
1342943406562148355 2020-12-27 05:20:33 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yeah...but Claire, all that matters is the immediate Covid threat. Just keep repeating...'all that matters is the immediate Covid threat. All that matters is the immediate Covid threat' etc etc. No-one wants to hear reasonable questions or facts that don't fit the fear narrative!
1342845448042770432 2020-12-26 22:51:18 +0800 <SteveCass14> That may or not be true but it is certainly open to that interpretation.
1342843860033134592 2020-12-26 22:44:59 +0800 <SteveCass14> Already happening I'm afraid. When life &amp; death dangers are exaggerated, people don't appreciate it.
1342835898224939013 2020-12-26 22:13:21 +0800 <SteveCass14> Not true in law but very true in practice.
1342835438340464641 2020-12-26 22:11:31 +0800 <SteveCass14> I hope you're not suggesting hypocrisy...... how very dare you??!!
1342835243129204737 2020-12-26 22:10:45 +0800 <SteveCass14> As Tom Holland said in his recent Unherd interview, 'the leadership of the Church of England has missed a real opportunity to make a difference during this Covid period. They have settled for being an unimportant sub-department within the secular Welfare State'.
1342833703710576640 2020-12-26 22:04:38 +0800 <SteveCass14> and the next installment of this guy's critique of Robin DiAngelo's 'White Fragility'.  https://t.co/8sCBmdkK6c
1342824698615377921 2020-12-26 21:28:51 +0800 <SteveCass14> @BallouxFrancois @NahasNewman I'm not sure it fuels impotence or defeatism as I agree that is bad. I think more &amp; more it is fuelling anger; fuelling a refusal to just accept what we are told; to be much braver in questioning what those with power/influence in any given situation insist we believe. Hopefully!
1342823761381306370 2020-12-26 21:25:07 +0800 <SteveCass14> It's amazing the nuggets you find casting around social media. Here's a video on White Fragility by Robin DiAngelo  https://t.co/JbzewCttd0

1342534717321732097 2020-12-26 02:16:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> Same with kindness or niceness.
1342511045315878913 2020-12-26 00:42:30 +0800 <SteveCass14> @SocialM85897394 Yes but London is no longer majority British, so his lack of traditonal patriotism doesn't matter that much politically.
1342399282897440768 2020-12-25 17:18:24 +0800 <SteveCass14> @BallouxFrancois @NahasNewman What is it about the term 'elite' you don't like? Or is it that it's too hard to define since in differing situations, the 'elite' are different.
1342370851874885634 2020-12-25 15:25:25 +0800 <SteveCass14> Good news on Covid here! A very interesting 10 minute listen with some startling data from official sources nearer the end.  https://t.co/gOnxoYlKen
1342112662927384579 2020-12-24 22:19:28 +0800 <SteveCass14> what planet is @b_judah on that he thinks that our international reputation and hosting world conferences of privileged elites is what matters for the UK in 2021? Most of us have far more normal and basic human hopes not this elitist reputational grandstanding crap!
1342059213305032706 2020-12-24 18:47:05 +0800 <SteveCass14> Well said!!
1342058898786811905 2020-12-24 18:45:50 +0800 <SteveCass14> aargghh!! You've tempted fate now! 😃
1342057842564542465 2020-12-24 18:41:38 +0800 <SteveCass14> @toryboypierce probably!
1342057486543683585 2020-12-24 18:40:13 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Salbo5 @truemagic68 So is wearing a mask indefinitely compatabe with quality of life? on what basis should that be decided? and who should get to decide? Can it be imposed in anything other than the short term?
1342056640636473345 2020-12-24 18:36:51 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes. The figures we are given could be more explicit on these key points.
1342004167234170882 2020-12-24 15:08:21 +0800 <SteveCass14> The simple question is: 'Does the Covid death rate warrant the level of response imposed by Government?'
1342001123897573381 2020-12-24 14:56:15 +0800 <SteveCass14> Far too many print &amp; TV journalists do not to seek objective truth. Rather they have found that ‘journalism’ is a useful camouflage for subjective political activists seeking influence without any meaningful accountability for the outcomes that their biased polemics bring about.
1341999921482887168 2020-12-24 14:51:29 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣🤣
1341842390466912257 2020-12-24 04:25:30 +0800 <SteveCass14> Hypocrisy and politics have always been the closest bed-fellows.
1341842107271700486 2020-12-24 04:24:23 +0800 <SteveCass14> @iainmartin1 @AlasdairIS Well that's good then because it's apparently such a lengthy document that it would take longer than we have to read it all, let alone have sensible thoughts about the content!
1341841807492177921 2020-12-24 04:23:11 +0800 <SteveCass14> @alliyoungmd @AlanMur67591225 Of course. How was it going to end any other way?
1341774961967509506 2020-12-23 23:57:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Bully61 @truemagic68 That could just be because they're Welsh, though! 🤣
1341774760368287744 2020-12-23 23:56:46 +0800 <SteveCass14> @RannsD @truemagic68 We should have identified the vulnerable over the summer months and put processes in place to isolate them &amp; their carers and everyone else gets on with it taking the precautions they feel comfortable with. There is no perfect answer. Too many unintended consequences.
1341773406107291651 2020-12-23 23:51:23 +0800 <SteveCass14> @tismeagainuk @SueC00K @Iwontcalmdown We will NEVER be rid of this virus in the same way we are NEVER going to be rid of flu viruses. We need to find ways of living with it without normal life coming to a virtual stop. Let's hope we can reach this point sometime next year.
1341772531578101767 2020-12-23 23:47:55 +0800 <SteveCass14> @RannsD @truemagic68 I have no doubt that schools are a factor. However, all respiratory viruses die down in the summer and come to the fore in autumn/winter, so it's not as simple as that. Also, the future societal problems from children not being properly educated &amp; not interacting may be worse.
1341770564625678336 2020-12-23 23:40:06 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Jamin2g Cite the evidence please.
1341770143920209922 2020-12-23 23:38:25 +0800 <SteveCass14> @truemagic68 Explain, 'none have worked'. What are you comparing it to? How do you know the lockdowns haven't worked? How do you know how many more or less would have died if we hadn't locked down? Now, if you're saying that you believe more will die &amp; suffer due to the lockdowns, I agree.
1341683563918483458 2020-12-23 17:54:23 +0800 <SteveCass14> @alexrubner But it's weird. They only have the upper hand because older people in positions of power and influence let them. WHY????!!
1341682336614760449 2020-12-23 17:49:30 +0800 <SteveCass14> @alexrubner Your last sentence is particularly pertinent. ALL politicised people under 30 have nothing but contempt for previous generations in whatever field they are operating.
1341485457717276679 2020-12-23 04:47:11 +0800 <SteveCass14> @GordonDudman @jaycee1001 But 'services' don't travel via ports but via computer/internet for the most part don't they? If not, what do you mean by 'services'? I'm thinking banking &amp; finance which is a major profit making export for us.
1341469752435347460 2020-12-23 03:44:46 +0800 <SteveCass14> Another example of the politicised under 30s having no wisdom and even less empathy for previous generations. Authoritarian narcissist.
1341390685916835848 2020-12-22 22:30:36 +0800 <SteveCass14> Assume that everyone means well; that they want the best outcome for as many as possible even when their view of what that looks like or the path to get there is different to yours. Happy Christmas to you all!
1341390684721475585 2020-12-22 22:30:35 +0800 <SteveCass14> So, can we stop the attempts to accrue virtue to oursleves by telling others how they should behave in order to fit our definition of 'niceness' or 'goodness'? But if you really need to, try this.....
1341390683534442499 2020-12-22 22:30:35 +0800 <SteveCass14> For 90%+ of us the answer will be NONE! We can't all agree on larger socio-political issues, largely because they are complex and there's always more than one way to tackle complex issues, none of which are perfect.
1341390682192273412 2020-12-22 22:30:35 +0800 <SteveCass14> Secondly, how many of us know anyone personally of whom it can reasonably/honestly be said that they are not a nice person? That they wouldn't help an old person who fell over in the street or try &amp; help someone knocked off their bike or wouldn't lend their neighbour some milk?
1341390680967553024 2020-12-22 22:30:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> At a time traditionally said to be of peace and goodwill to all, here is my Christmas thought. Anyone else get fed up with posts telling everyone to be nice or kind and care more for others?  Firstly, the implication is 'be like me', which is pretty narcissistic;
1341389857998909447 2020-12-22 22:27:18 +0800 <SteveCass14> Thanks for pointing out the true priority here!
1341304179978072065 2020-12-22 16:46:51 +0800 <SteveCass14> 2of2. This laudable individual view, while sadly often more tokenistic than meaningful, then gets extrapolated to putting other countries and other peoples before their own.
1341304101230030848 2020-12-22 16:46:32 +0800 <SteveCass14> @MSANNCOOPER Rooted in Christianity, it’s an acceptance of original sin whereby you are guilty simply by existing; and of course, the easier/happier your life, the more guilty you are. Absolution for your self-imposed guilt is required and is gained by putting others before yourself. 1of2
1341290721345744896 2020-12-22 15:53:22 +0800 <SteveCass14> What I don't understand is why so many middle class people feel so guilty about their comparatively easy life that they need to assuage it by favouring other countries/peoples over their own. Maybe it's a form of atonement allowing them to justify continuing with their lifestyle?
1341288276720803841 2020-12-22 15:43:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> Putting your own needy people first doesn't tick a high enough box in their virtue-signalling hierarchy.
1341140280561586181 2020-12-22 05:55:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> That's true.
1341006063001362435 2020-12-21 21:02:14 +0800 <SteveCass14> Fair enough Ian. As I think we agree, people looking for perfect scenarios are expecting too much. Have as good a Christmas &amp; New Year as possible &amp; let's hope 2021 turns out better.
1341001621984129025 2020-12-21 20:44:35 +0800 <SteveCass14> @iashy @lisanandy You can't have a perfect system in situations like this but it's easy to identify the over 75s and those with existing conditions most likely to be affected by a respiratory virus via GP/NHS records. Isolate/family bubble the vulnerable &amp; let others make their own choices maybe?
1340687659858059266 2020-12-20 23:57:01 +0800 <SteveCass14> @iashy @lisanandy We weren't in lockdown in September were we Ian? If all is ok when not in lockdown but every other medical condition gets put on hold when we are, then we have a health lottery. The summer months were wasted when a more targetted approach to the vulnerable could have been devised
1340686718475923456 2020-12-20 23:53:17 +0800 <SteveCass14> @iashy @lisanandy I'm sure there's some truth in that. However, it's also true that many people are compliant for purely personal selfish reasons. We need the middle ground. Extreme positions breed extreme counter positions and that's when things can get out of hand.
1340609381570916357 2020-12-20 18:45:58 +0800 <SteveCass14> @iashy @lisanandy The Government's job is to see and then balance ALL the risks, medical &amp; non-medical both now and for the future. Yet it, along with the other political parties, seems only to see the Covid risk. It's not unreasonable to question whether or not they've got the balance right.
1340608582958653441 2020-12-20 18:42:48 +0800 <SteveCass14> @iashy @lisanandy The problem is authoritarianism v libertarianism. It's not clear cut although many seem to think it is. I like this tweet from Dr Philip Hammond.  https://t.co/Qs1KiNOK2j What about all the deaths and suffering caused by the knock-on effects of lockdowns as opposed to from covid?
1340602718646317057 2020-12-20 18:19:29 +0800 <SteveCass14> @whoopsadaisy17 Social media seems to allow people to be much braver/stupider. Why it stops people thinking in a rational way is weird!
1340582910823428096 2020-12-20 17:00:47 +0800 <SteveCass14> @iashy Difficult, as my family also follows the rules &amp; are very careful about where we go/who we mingle with. BUT I can never see unquestioning obedience to authority as being 'strong' &amp; questioning as being 'weak'. It's MY considered decision to comply. I am not complying out of fear.
1340581767640657920 2020-12-20 16:56:14 +0800 <SteveCass14> @iashy Ian, you obviously hold very strong views on this, presumably because of your own experiences. For my part, if given a stark choice, I would rather risk anarchy by encouraging freedom of thought than risk slavery via automatic unquestioning compliance.
1340576015949701120 2020-12-20 16:33:23 +0800 <SteveCass14> @iashy Is refusing to auto-accept what you're told by Government a sign of 'mental weakness'? If they have information they are keeping to themselves, they shouldn't; &amp; it won't be because it makes their case stronger. And the new tier 4 may not be house arrest but it's not far off!
1340389327566725121 2020-12-20 04:11:33 +0800 <SteveCass14> @iashy I didn't say there had been but there ARE some who want that level of restrictions on our freedom. When you add up, the non-covid medical deaths &amp; extra pain/suffering+isolation mental health/suicides +unemployment+economic depression effects, where should the balance be drawn?
1340386963753463808 2020-12-20 04:02:10 +0800 <SteveCass14> @ukhomeoffice @Dis_Critic You could start by not allowing biological males into female only spaces just because they claim they've been born in the wrong body! The line needs to be drawn before it's too late for the safety of women &amp; girls. Political correctness &amp; identity politics have no place here!
1340385933972090885 2020-12-20 03:58:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> @TheVietGwent Yes. It is possible that an emotion-based response may also happen across the best answer. Not likely but it may happen occasionally by chance. 😃
1340385452348608512 2020-12-20 03:56:09 +0800 <SteveCass14> @iashy Only idiots want a free for all just like only idiots want an entire zero movement house-arrest lockdown. It's about balance &amp; where it should be set. In 10 years time, do you think more death &amp;suffering (across all issues) will have been caused by covid or by the response to it?
1340272632080556032 2020-12-19 20:27:51 +0800 <SteveCass14> @iashy Depends on your definition. It's certainly very much a minority and I'm thankful that it is. My comment was about the method of using emotion to try and justify certain policies when ALL the adverse effects on Covid should be assessed medical &amp; non-medical.
1340269480493142016 2020-12-19 20:15:19 +0800 <SteveCass14> OUCH!! 😃
1340268558320852992 2020-12-19 20:11:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> Exactly my position as explained here. 😃 https://t.co/tlM2Jlm4U7
1339830855594881026 2020-12-18 15:12:23 +0800 <SteveCass14> Neither do 80% of white people Katharine. Sadly the 20% are the ones with most of the power &amp; influence!
1339829517662208001 2020-12-18 15:07:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> The NHS is uncriticisable within our society, which essentially means it's almost impossible to improve.
1339825423753097216 2020-12-18 14:50:48 +0800 <SteveCass14> Thoughts on the UK's Covid response.  https://t.co/tlM2Jlm4U7
1339818284712116224 2020-12-18 14:22:26 +0800 <SteveCass14> How about - 'It is wrong to justify harm to children to satisfy the desire of a VERY VERY SMALL community of MENTALLY TROUBLED ACTIVIST adults'?
1339816506742493185 2020-12-18 14:15:22 +0800 <SteveCass14> When someone (or group) wants to be treated the same as everyone else when it suits them but given special treatment when it suits, be very wary. They're either utterly lacking in self-awareness, pathologically selfish or up to no good!
1338576988311851011 2020-12-15 04:09:58 +0800 <SteveCass14> Correct, sir. It's not that we in the UK would mind, it's just not allowed for non-Commonwealth citizens.
1338220499923570688 2020-12-14 04:33:24 +0800 <SteveCass14> Wow. She must have pissed some people off to turn on their own like this!
1338219187932684294 2020-12-14 04:28:11 +0800 <SteveCass14> His total belief in his self-righteousness is nauseating!
1338218779440984064 2020-12-14 04:26:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> hope so!
1338217469023055874 2020-12-14 04:21:22 +0800 <SteveCass14> I can't believe she thinks before she speaks. Either that or a 'Party' line has been decided on these things and she doesn't care how wrong it is.
1338083753441325056 2020-12-13 19:30:01 +0800 <SteveCass14> brilliant! 🤣🤣
1338082813036421121 2020-12-13 19:26:17 +0800 <SteveCass14> Many people are so afraid of the one medical condition, Covid-19, that they are prepared to ignore all other medical &amp; non-medical forms of suffering caused by focussing solely on that one thing. Fear that turns off your wider perspective &amp; critical faculties is FEAR indeed.
1338077274558623744 2020-12-13 19:04:17 +0800 <SteveCass14> Many people are so afraid of the one medical condtion, Covid-19, that they are prepared to ignore all other medical &amp; non-medical forms of suffering caused by focussing solely on that one thing.

1338029551553826821 2020-12-13 15:54:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> Thought for the Day: When instead of looking at each issue on its merits, you have an ideology/Party that you support come what may, don't be surprised to be called out for being hypocritical, contradictory or just an arsehole from time to time.
1338028306982187012 2020-12-13 15:49:42 +0800 <SteveCass14> What a surprise! Those who feel that they do very nicely from the UK being in the EU are full of doom and gloom; those that feel that the way the EU operates contributes in a negative way just want out no matter what. Both extremes are wrong as extreme views always are.
1338027566259724291 2020-12-13 15:46:45 +0800 <SteveCass14> I'm with women on not allowing trans-women to be treated as it they're 'real' women (e.g. in sports/women only spaces) but some of the man-hating language that you see on twitter around this issue is massively counter-productive long term.
1338025978937929730 2020-12-13 15:40:27 +0800 <SteveCass14> Don't expect to be taken seriously if you say you are against identity politics but continue voting for the same political parties as the identity politickers (Lab/LibD/Green). The zealots determination always beats the moderates in the end. They can only be stopped not appeased.
1338023013753761797 2020-12-13 15:28:40 +0800 <SteveCass14> You're not suggesting bad faith agendas and hypoocrisy surely??!!
1338022478636085249 2020-12-13 15:26:32 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣
1338021772487254017 2020-12-13 15:23:44 +0800 <SteveCass14> They can't. How could they? Their whole view is based on a sad mix of mental health issues, victimhood as a path to power, and bullying anyone who disagrees.
1338019473966723073 2020-12-13 15:14:36 +0800 <SteveCass14> It's so obvious, you do have to wonder what planet those who promote and allow this stuff to take place are living on.
1338017197298503681 2020-12-13 15:05:33 +0800 <SteveCass14> Wise words. I'm with women on not allowing trans-women to be treated as it they're 'real' women (e.g. in sports/women only spaces) but some of the man-hating language that you see on twitter around this issue is massively counter-productive long term.
1338013200483291144 2020-12-13 14:49:40 +0800 <SteveCass14> Good point!
1338012659875278849 2020-12-13 14:47:31 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. It's a ridiculously privileged problem stemming from narcissism &amp; mental instability issues.
1337869629071519745 2020-12-13 05:19:10 +0800 <SteveCass14> What a disgusting individual he is. However, I suspect he's lying about getting someone sacked.
1337868824884940803 2020-12-13 05:15:58 +0800 <SteveCass14> FFS!!
1337867881921585154 2020-12-13 05:12:14 +0800 <SteveCass14> Bottom line is, he's not an upgrade on Buckner yet he's being paid a load of money. Being paid that much $ - no excuses for getting no QB pressure.
1337867454832373760 2020-12-13 05:10:32 +0800 <SteveCass14> But he's not an upgrade on Buckner and has zero pass rush pressure which is why the Bills made us look lousy. When you look at his money, he's not stepped up like he should.
1337808521526726657 2020-12-13 01:16:21 +0800 <SteveCass14> @andrewdoyle_com Seen a couple of your indentity politics videos &amp; agree with you. The problem I see is those on the 'Left' who oppose identity politics tend to vote for the same political parties as the identity politickers (Lab/LibD/Green). How does that work in fighting it?
1337806085126828034 2020-12-13 01:06:40 +0800 <SteveCass14> Armstead, John? Seriously? I'd rather keep Jimmy Ward - more versatile. Love your you tube analysis. best wishes from the UK.
1337773848100560896 2020-12-12 22:58:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> Massively so! And that a guy in such a comparatively influential/successful position (compared to the majority) and who clearly has done pretty well in this supposedly racist society can talk such bitter &amp; divisive rubbish is very sad indeed. Pathetic!
1337772895569924097 2020-12-12 22:54:47 +0800 <SteveCass14> He doesn't care. The only message you need to take away is WHITE RACISM!!!!! Got it?? 😒
1337772510201470977 2020-12-12 22:53:15 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Botanygeek What a sad and toxic individual you are.
1337771998420881411 2020-12-12 22:51:13 +0800 <SteveCass14> If someone tells you that what makes certain behaviour good or bad is not the behaviour itself but who it is that's doing it, you know they are not to be trusted.
1337642968984002560 2020-12-12 14:18:30 +0800 <SteveCass14> Interesting
1337641564055724032 2020-12-12 14:12:55 +0800 <SteveCass14> Perhaps 'real' Brexit or 'true' Brexit?
1337641038765240326 2020-12-12 14:10:50 +0800 <SteveCass14> Cue the flood of law suits but those at the top of the NHS who, based on no medical evidence, gave the go-ahead to Tavistock in the first place will get of scott-free!
1337639859356307458 2020-12-12 14:06:09 +0800 <SteveCass14> Cue the lawsuits but the people at the top of the NHS that gave the go-ahead to Tavistock in the first place will get off scott-free!
1337314814897623041 2020-12-11 16:34:32 +0800 <SteveCass14> very sad.
1337313866284494848 2020-12-11 16:30:46 +0800 <SteveCass14> @camanpour @NicolaSturgeon The first part of your opening sentence is simply factually incorrect. You're supposed to be a journalist, not an apologist for any left-leaning party or figure.
1337312543178690560 2020-12-11 16:25:31 +0800 <SteveCass14> WTF?!! The SNP are looking like left-wing dictators in the making!
1336679633757073415 2020-12-09 22:30:33 +0800 <SteveCass14> Of course. Middle-class narcisissts don't care about the poor; they may say they do but not in practice. Most middle-class driven 'causes' will adversely affect the bottom 25% but the righteous can't be wrong; and they have awarded themselves that accolade unequivocally.
1336407667426922502 2020-12-09 04:29:51 +0800 <SteveCass14> Why do radical misfits do anything?
1336342027521335298 2020-12-09 00:09:02 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣But of course, it's exactly how they think!! FFS!!
1336341272290676739 2020-12-09 00:06:01 +0800 <SteveCass14> 👇One rule for the plebs, another for us famous people.
1335325947667615745 2020-12-06 04:51:29 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. But it can only be used like this because, as with covid, we're being asked to accept a narrative from on high even though there seem to be reasonable counter-arguments. The fact that these are dismissed out of hand encourages opposition. Neither extreme view is right.
1335317562591162377 2020-12-06 04:18:10 +0800 <SteveCass14> CV19 is real. But draw a line; on the left write 'bubonic plague' &amp; on the right, put 'virulent flu strain'. Just look at the data and tell me where on the line CV19 should sit.
1335315442089533441 2020-12-06 04:09:45 +0800 <SteveCass14> and lots of it!! In fact we'd know it was you 'cos you'd be the  one sneezing constantly! 😃
1335313718310277123 2020-12-06 04:02:54 +0800 <SteveCass14> Letting the most fragile/victimhood claimant dictate what is acceptable may end well for them but it won't for anyone else; including the middle-class liberals who support them; by the time they realise that they aren't exempt from the tyranny they've unleashed it'll be too late!
1335310023363354624 2020-12-06 03:48:13 +0800 <SteveCass14> Spot on. We have entered the final decadent phase that all dominant cultures eventually reach.
1334600683811704837 2020-12-04 04:49:33 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yep, it's right up there on the not very bright scale. The difference is that one happens naturally and the other has to be medically induced! Duh!!
1333804971234619393 2020-12-02 00:07:40 +0800 <SteveCass14> By abstaining, he's fence sitting, hoping to be able to claim in the future to have been for or against dependent on what hindsight tells us would have been best. There's no principle here, just the political equivalent of wanting his cake &amp; eat it, &amp; hoping voters won't notice.
1333801769407713285 2020-12-01 23:54:57 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣🤣
1333799739234549760 2020-12-01 23:46:53 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣😀🤣
1333784276739911681 2020-12-01 22:45:26 +0800 <SteveCass14> Hmm... interesting point.
1333782065045663744 2020-12-01 22:36:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> I wasn't. I was merely explaining why I agreed with @SaltyDuchess on this particular issue. 😀
1333778789726302210 2020-12-01 22:23:38 +0800 <SteveCass14> By abstaining, he's fence sitting, hoping to be able to claim in the future to have been for or against dependent on what hindsight tells us would have been best.

1333776732483096576 2020-12-01 22:15:28 +0800 <SteveCass14> Self-righteousness is a great mindset with which to give yourself permission to ignore the adverse consequences to others when actioning your beliefs.
1333704510183776257 2020-12-01 17:28:28 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. I never watch anyhting with Morgan in it!
1333704360111599619 2020-12-01 17:27:53 +0800 <SteveCass14> Couldn't agree more! Diversity of thought is the most important diversity and is the one being totally ignored.
1333697390877024256 2020-12-01 17:00:11 +0800 <SteveCass14> took the economic benefits of free trade while maintaining their dictatorship. They laugh at us and see only weakness. They're right! We have reached the decadent phase that all dominant cultures eventually reach and the West will steadily decline as China rises.
1333697389694169089 2020-12-01 17:00:11 +0800 <SteveCass14> in a Western Liberal Democracy who supports China needs to take a long hard look at themselves. It was decided that if we included China in the world economy it would lead to the crumbling of the regime and the introduction of democracy. That's been proven wrong. They simply
1333697388196876294 2020-12-01 17:00:10 +0800 <SteveCass14> China is a dictatorship that has, over the last 70 years and still now (the Uiyghurs), caused the death and oppression of over 100 million of its people. The Chinese people's only freedom is the freedom to do what they're told - or else! As far as I'm concerned, anyone
1333695361051987968 2020-12-01 16:52:07 +0800 <SteveCass14> I just think Piers Morgan is an arrogant clown playing a role that his paymasters are happy with. He's rude &amp; obnoxious to a lot of people, not just women.
1333691841410179079 2020-12-01 16:38:08 +0800 <SteveCass14> yes, but the flight to the country was a reaction to covid confnement &amp; will end as the buyers tax cut/furlough payments stop &amp; the economy turnsdown. Many buying now will find their house worth less in 6-12 months time. They'll also find travel into big cities tiring &amp; expensive
1333374524230873088 2020-11-30 19:37:14 +0800 <SteveCass14> Sigh! FFS!!
1333156471207567361 2020-11-30 05:10:46 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣🤣
1333002716185042946 2020-11-29 18:59:48 +0800 <SteveCass14> Good point.
1332993361679093760 2020-11-29 18:22:37 +0800 <SteveCass14> The police do have a very tough job. But the question is, on what basis are they deciding which protests to just stand back &amp; allow and which to wade in and make arrests at? These choices are being made &amp; you telling anyone who asks why/how to 'go boil their head', isn't helpful.
1332989025062449152 2020-11-29 18:05:23 +0800 <SteveCass14> 'The essential principle of totalitarianism is to make laws that are impossible to obey.' C Hitchens We have many laws, including unwritten rules, that are either impossible or so difficult/demoralising to obey, that we feel that our lives are not properly under our own control.
1332987061297704968 2020-11-29 17:57:35 +0800 <SteveCass14> Whether it's ever changing covid rules or what can be said or what is acceptable around identity politics, they are all forms of authoritarianism. You can have democratic elections but if those with the power/influence agree with each other, it will be a dictatorship in practice.
1332987059959701504 2020-11-29 17:57:35 +0800 <SteveCass14> 'The true essence of a dictatorship is in fact not it's regularity but its unpredictability &amp; caprice; those who live under it must never be able to relax, must never be quite sure if they have followed the rules correctly or not.' - Christopher Hitchens (Hat tip, Heather Heying)
1332262875394609153 2020-11-27 17:59:56 +0800 <SteveCass14>  https://t.co/D0eh3TF7oZ There has to come a point when the past has to be, not forgotten, but not used as a reason to maintain bitterness/victimhood. No-one can claim to want unity if they continually hold the actions of past generations over the heads of the current generation.
1332234884539174913 2020-11-27 16:08:42 +0800 <SteveCass14> that limelight. Occasionally, some wider good may come out of it; but that's a lucky by-product, not the main aim. I know that sounds cynical but these two keep appearing in the media too often.
1332234883427688448 2020-11-27 16:08:42 +0800 <SteveCass14> Who am I thinking of? Sadly, like all narcissists, publicity/fame/notoriety are like a drug. Once in the limelight, they can't leave it, and with a PR team on the staff, they do a great job of making sure there are always plausible/worthy sounding reasons to keep their client in
1332058227345854474 2020-11-27 04:26:44 +0800 <SteveCass14> True. Indeed it's often a deflection tactic aimed at stopping scrutiny of their own behaviour.
1332021058375966727 2020-11-27 01:59:02 +0800 <SteveCass14> Sorry - please don't be mean to me! 🤣
1332020813235707906 2020-11-27 01:58:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> Have you any idea just how screwed we would be if we all got to do work of our choice? Think of all the necessary but hard, boring, dull jobs that wouldn't get done if we could all earn a living from just doing things we enjoy!
1331939293254864898 2020-11-26 20:34:08 +0800 <SteveCass14> Why is that on social media, those who try and project a meek &amp; mild, kind/tolerant persona, are often the nastiest &amp; most intolerant when anyone says something they don't agree with?
1331569860145520640 2020-11-25 20:06:08 +0800 <SteveCass14> Well it worked with the Climate Change narrative of course, so why not?
1331566408988233728 2020-11-25 19:52:25 +0800 <SteveCass14> It must be so easy to slip into the latter while telling yourself what a kind and generous person you are. Kindness with hidden/selfish motive is questionable.
1331566407889326082 2020-11-25 19:52:25 +0800 <SteveCass14> There can be a fine line to draw between using your wealth to be generous to those less fortunate than yourself and using your wealth to impose your socio-political morality on those less fortunate than yourself.
1331211965251940353 2020-11-24 20:23:59 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yikes - and Labour are the only realistic alternative to Boris? We're screwed!
1331161589362417664 2020-11-24 17:03:49 +0800 <SteveCass14> echelons of society. Their socio-political theories don't work in practice because they assume everyone thinks like them. They assume perfection of thought/motive/behaviour/ character/ability etc. We need highly intelligent folk who mix socially &amp; don't believe their own hype!
1331161588213182464 2020-11-24 17:03:49 +0800 <SteveCass14> You can be TOO intelligent for your and everyone else's good. It's easy for high IQ folk to believe that this means that what they think MUST be right. They conflate IQ with perfect judgment &amp; wisdom. Also, they are often incapable of understanding the perspective of the lower
1330845770602438657 2020-11-23 20:08:52 +0800 <SteveCass14> It's relatively easy to decide what is good/bad or fair/unfair when dealing with individuals or small groups, especially if you have time to get to know them. But this low order decision-making can't translate up to millions of people. So faceless processes are used and fail.
1330843938203312130 2020-11-23 20:01:35 +0800 <SteveCass14> We DO know who they are. The Chair and Board of the National Trust is public information and not hard to find.
1330812011937148929 2020-11-23 17:54:43 +0800 <SteveCass14> The cynical take. Middle class liberals just support the group seen as being at the bottom of the victim hierachy. Women are nowhere near the bottom - hell, they're not even a minority! So we'd like to support women as we used to but trans scores more oppression points. Sorry!
1330808413543084032 2020-11-23 17:40:25 +0800 <SteveCass14> The stock in trade tactic of bad faith radical actors, sadly.
1330807567774310400 2020-11-23 17:37:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> @truemagic68 @anthea_bailey In a country of 70 millions, there are all kinds of bad behaviours and attitudes that exist. The question is, how bad is it? And as it can't be measured, we believe what we want to believe about it.
1330587148970504199 2020-11-23 03:01:12 +0800 <SteveCass14> You missed out weak and dangerous!
1330585954273406979 2020-11-23 02:56:27 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed.
1330224900276166657 2020-11-22 03:01:45 +0800 <SteveCass14> Of course. In how many sports is the world record for men worse than that for women? - and that difference cascades down through all the levels.
1330150385819017218 2020-11-21 22:05:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> Not good for anyone!!
1330149643682983937 2020-11-21 22:02:42 +0800 <SteveCass14> This guy gets it. In old fashioned terms - it's just rude to go to another country and not abide by its laws and culture or expect special treatment.
1330148129631559680 2020-11-21 21:56:41 +0800 <SteveCass14> So BIlly's just a misogynist after all! Women should not have to pretend that men are women. No group, minority or otherwise, should be supported 'no matter what'. The WHAT matters and in the case of transwomen they are attempting to subsume the rights of biological females.
1330147886085115908 2020-11-21 21:55:43 +0800 <SteveCass14> @billybragg @NehandaMusic @NestFolk @DebbieHayton So just a misogynist after all Billy! Women should not have to pretend that men are women. No group, minority or otherwise, should be supported 'no matter what'. The WHAT matters and in the case of transwomen they are attempting to subsume the rights of biological females.
1330143401388478464 2020-11-21 21:37:54 +0800 <SteveCass14> Of course!
1330121485852225544 2020-11-21 20:10:49 +0800 <SteveCass14> Hmm... difficult decision....😀
1330121111812632580 2020-11-21 20:09:20 +0800 <SteveCass14> The obvious way to get electricity from solar is to pick locations that are already blighted in some way. So alongside motorways &amp; dual carriageways for example.
1330120029812248579 2020-11-21 20:05:02 +0800 <SteveCass14> Very well said!!
1330102605389946884 2020-11-21 18:55:47 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣
1330102394680696836 2020-11-21 18:54:57 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. Deliberately not paying tax in his home country just makes Hamilton's socio-political finger-wagging look hypocritical. On his wages he would pay a lot of tax which could help the NHS etc etc
1330098167292030979 2020-11-21 18:38:09 +0800 <SteveCass14> Makes you think - or should!
1330094760443449344 2020-11-21 18:24:37 +0800 <SteveCass14> They ARE in tune with what their own children think! 🤣
1329702320750419969 2020-11-20 16:25:12 +0800 <SteveCass14> Simple. The political, media &amp; academic elite class see policies that only adversely affect the working classes as a great way to virtue-signal and assuage the historic guilt they've been persuaded they should feel, while not affecting their own lives or status in any way.
1329422178496831493 2020-11-19 21:52:01 +0800 <SteveCass14> @brez262 @SampaJinpa @DonNantwich @psibernaut Possibly true but perhaps he should have considered more carefully the methods that would be employed to get to his utopia. Theorists always have this problem; they don't live in the world of the ordinary person &amp; therfore fail to see how their theories can be abused or corrupted
1329370029314482176 2020-11-19 18:24:48 +0800 <SteveCass14> @DonNantwich @psibernaut perhaps because Marx said socialism was the half-way house to communism and once socialism is established, it brings full communism that much closer? So socialism is communism-lite and doesn't sound quite so threatening.
1329327041284624384 2020-11-19 15:33:59 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agred. Social engineering and politics is NOT science in a proper sense; it's a distortion; a bastardisation.
1329326689311219714 2020-11-19 15:32:35 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed
1329326056625549312 2020-11-19 15:30:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> It bothers me that people in very privileged positions tell others in less privileged positions that they are in fact highly &amp; unfairly privileged &amp; should therefore be ashamed of themselves. Especially as the highly privileged finger-waggers never seem to change their own lives
1329325175519780866 2020-11-19 15:26:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣
1329324971454291969 2020-11-19 15:25:45 +0800 <SteveCass14> Why no recognition of the fact that it is the way many countries are goverened that cause so many of their people to go hungry &amp; that throwing money at it will not change that problem? Still if an excercise in pointless virtue-signalling to your echo chamber was the aim - bravo!
1329323557604749316 2020-11-19 15:20:08 +0800 <SteveCass14> We live in dangerous times. If we tell ourselves that our way of thinking is the only acceptable way, the more likely to usher in dictatorship. It only takes a crisis, covid perhaps(?), to give some the excuse they need to become authoritarian -all for the greater good of course!
1329323556384235520 2020-11-19 15:20:08 +0800 <SteveCass14> Possibly the worst thing about social media is that it has turned most, if not all of us, into moralisers; more than happy to tell others what they should think and what attitudes are acceptable and what aren't etc.
1328796923311124481 2020-11-18 04:27:29 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣
1328714839057965056 2020-11-17 23:01:18 +0800 <SteveCass14> While they keep winning elections, no, they won't stop!
1328674744099594241 2020-11-17 20:21:59 +0800 <SteveCass14> But it won't take long after that for 'petrol' stations to convert to fast-charging electric stations making it harder and harder (and more and more expensive) to buy petrol or diesel. So by 2035 or certainly by 2040, you will almost have to get rid of your petrol/diesel car.
1328309107397365761 2020-11-16 20:09:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣
1328306162257833985 2020-11-16 19:57:22 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed!
1328079409929203712 2020-11-16 04:56:20 +0800 <SteveCass14> Terrific and inciteful interview here from @triggerpod  https://t.co/eSUflqmhHL
1328052255380172802 2020-11-16 03:08:26 +0800 <SteveCass14> She is one of the worst politicians for not having a clue about subjects she talks about, which is saying something!
1328051312970391552 2020-11-16 03:04:41 +0800 <SteveCass14> It's either a staggerig lack of self-awareness or deliberate and knowing bad faith. Which do you think it is?
1327909328230158337 2020-11-15 17:40:29 +0800 <SteveCass14> How about the scientists &amp; their families having the vaccine first and then, if no health issues after 6 months, the rest of us will consider it?
1327909259883982848 2020-11-15 17:40:13 +0800 <SteveCass14> How about the scientists &amp; their families aving the vaccine first and then, if no health issues after 6 months, the rest of us will consider it?
1327908927502168064 2020-11-15 17:38:54 +0800 <SteveCass14> YES.
1327908360050667520 2020-11-15 17:36:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> It's not for scientists to demand particular socio-political policies. Just do the science.
1327908083583111168 2020-11-15 17:35:33 +0800 <SteveCass14> Don't agree with the Government's policy on covid but I can understand it. Faced with two risks, to overplay the threat or underplay it, they have decided that, however badly history treats them, it will be worse if they'd underplayed it and hundreds of thousands had died.
1327905951333146625 2020-11-15 17:27:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> So much damage can be done to society by a combination of the assumption of intellectual superiority with the utter certainty of your own self-righteousness. If you have these traits, then all you need is power/influence and dictatorship is but a simple trick of fate away.
1327902298719150080 2020-11-15 17:12:33 +0800 <SteveCass14> When there are clearly a whole host of reasons for group disparities, the claim that there is only ONE reason (or only one that matters) has to be seen for what it is, a power play. RACISM leads to VICTIMHOOD leads to POWER via 'white' guilt.  https://t.co/exDaUE3bHa
1327900672973545472 2020-11-15 17:06:06 +0800 <SteveCass14> It would be fair enough if it was true...but it isn't, so it's just saying what they woud like to be true as if it really is. Self-validation.
1327714739041013761 2020-11-15 04:47:16 +0800 <SteveCass14> 👇
1327591136274341889 2020-11-14 20:36:06 +0800 <SteveCass14> Not sure either of these are the answer although they will be for some. For others it's the simple idea that a 'good' person must always be on the side of the underdog. The Palestinians are less powerful than the Israelis. Simplistic, childlike thinking but that's all it is.
1327549688258695168 2020-11-14 17:51:25 +0800 <SteveCass14> True kindness is helping people to have agency &amp; responsibility for their own lives so that they can hold their heads up high. It's not true kindness to constantly give people help with no expectation that they need to do anything for it. Low expectations is servitude in disguise
1327177054085935105 2020-11-13 17:10:42 +0800 <SteveCass14> Both Conservative &amp; Labour Parties are lockdown zealots.
1327175641482014721 2020-11-13 17:05:05 +0800 <SteveCass14> The lockdown zealots have changed tack though. They now say, 'ok, very few die, but it creates long term respiratory problems in far more than flu.'. Not sure what the eveidence is for this!
1327172572765708288 2020-11-13 16:52:53 +0800 <SteveCass14> Everything is racist!!! Do you get it yet??? EVERYTHING IS RACIST!!! It would be laughable if it wasn't so dangerous!!
1327168966167552000 2020-11-13 16:38:33 +0800 <SteveCass14> I agree with both Julia and John Major. We should stop pretending that we are important enough to have any real influence in the world while not looking at our history and hating ourselves. I am a proud Brit but that doesn't extend to an attitude pretending it's still 1890.
1327167233391554562 2020-11-13 16:31:40 +0800 <SteveCass14> I agree that it was an unnecessary criticism. Since when have Hindus made any trouble in the UK??? At least pick your targets based on evidence not just to be snarky. In fairness, she's usually on point but I certainly wouldn't have tweeted this.
1327166230172725248 2020-11-13 16:27:41 +0800 <SteveCass14> I assume the irony of a murderous dictatorship speaking about democracy and the choice of the people isn't lost on anyone?
1326989479865950208 2020-11-13 04:45:20 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Howard_Goodall 1st world middle-class problems can be endured surely? Not really the end of the world this is it? You'll just need to be a better organised in future. To make your life a bit easier is why you want to remain in the EU?? Wow - so missing the point of Brexit. Grow-up!
1326809040341577728 2020-11-12 16:48:20 +0800 <SteveCass14> WTF!!!???
1326808862066958336 2020-11-12 16:47:38 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes. It's a problem if anyone feels that their side winning is more impoortant than their side winning fairly &amp; honestly.
1326806640440512513 2020-11-12 16:38:48 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes. Fascism was just a different form of Marxism. Hitler &amp; Mussolini were Marxists and recognised as such by, for example, Lenin. It wasn't called the National Socialist party for fun - he meant it. It later morphed but was still inherently Marxist in its foundations.
1326609893667856391 2020-11-12 03:37:00 +0800 <SteveCass14> 😒
1326608954391191553 2020-11-12 03:33:16 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. And why are the atrocities of Fascism taught everywhere but the atrocities of Communism, which was responsible for far more deaths overall, rarely taught at all?
1326607934839803906 2020-11-12 03:29:13 +0800 <SteveCass14> Same in Music. My son had a song to sing for Grade 6 which I sang 40 years ago at a lower grade. Of course, it's in the best interest of the Dept of Education to pretend standards are constantly increasing. Very hard to achieve, unless you constantly lower the bar that is!
1326606223190487041 2020-11-12 03:22:25 +0800 <SteveCass14> Sadly, I think they do know their history and are ashamed of it. So this nonsense is an attempt to abslove themselves of the guilt they feel on behalf of historical peoples and societies. It's arrogant &amp; condescending toward the past.
1326554978157293568 2020-11-11 23:58:47 +0800 <SteveCass14> More bollox! But why did the FA hierarchy not support him and tell the complainers to go do one??
1326554750742007808 2020-11-11 23:57:53 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes. Bollox isn't it??
1326549287736549383 2020-11-11 23:36:10 +0800 <SteveCass14> I can only assume that it helps them feel better about themselves (why??) without having to actually change anything about their own middle-class lifestyles whatsoever. The epitomy of hypocritical virtue-signalling.
1326506051437465600 2020-11-11 20:44:22 +0800 <SteveCass14> Only when those in politics and other influencers start saying no to it. Ordinary folk with no influence won't stop it sadly, even though they constitute the vast majoroty of the people.
1326497736645111808 2020-11-11 20:11:20 +0800 <SteveCass14> @AmyLake95695934 And don't forget the total lack of self-awareness via their self-righteousness! The righteous can do or think no wrong!
1326495004957741056 2020-11-11 20:00:28 +0800 <SteveCass14> When zealots &amp; ideologues continuously overstate their case and continuously try to silence anyone who disagrees, then many who were somewhat sympathetic start turning away. I know I do. I won't be told what I MUST think or that if I disagree it shows I must be stupid or evil.
1326454696626843649 2020-11-11 17:20:18 +0800 <SteveCass14> And should them being offended matter anyway as he clearly had no intention to offend?
1326446142771630080 2020-11-11 16:46:19 +0800 <SteveCass14> Pls explain why so many in the top 50% of wealth/income seem so ready to support societal change that will not adversely affect them in any meaningful way while seeming not to care for those in the bottom 50% who don’t want these changes? Elitism camouflaged as kindness/caring?
1326442577499975680 2020-11-11 16:32:09 +0800 <SteveCass14> Of course. the idea that appeasement stops the behaviour is ludicrous!
1326439570473414657 2020-11-11 16:20:12 +0800 <SteveCass14> FFS!
1325529331548950528 2020-11-09 04:03:14 +0800 <SteveCass14> Irrespective of whether I agree or not, when you know you have a platform &amp; that many people follow you on social media, it would be better not to make political comments when you know that isn't what people follow you to hear about. It's arrogant &amp; self-absorbed.
1325526066631479303 2020-11-09 03:50:16 +0800 <SteveCass14> media just pigeon hole people because it's easy and they're lazy.
1325524937805860865 2020-11-09 03:45:46 +0800 <SteveCass14> A fool? Possibly. Virtue-signalling narcissist, certainly. 😀
1325523733730254854 2020-11-09 03:40:59 +0800 <SteveCass14> On a local facebook group we have a post complaining about fireworks because it scares animals. There were a lot of replies, easily 50 within 3 hours, and 90% agreed. Ban fireworks. The poster and all but 2 of the respondents female. What do you make of that?
1325116856596828165 2020-11-08 00:44:12 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1325114134573293574 2020-11-08 00:33:23 +0800 <SteveCass14> Much truth here!
1324720136494977026 2020-11-06 22:27:47 +0800 <SteveCass14> Always the case. The wise and beneficent elite know what's best for us plebs and wish we would just be grateful to our betters and do what we're told! 😒
1324711750072209410 2020-11-06 21:54:27 +0800 <SteveCass14> @WholeFoodsPR Your poppy decision is a disgrace. Who exactly do you think will be applauding you and why do you think there will be more of them than those who will be disgusted? Stop pandering to left-wing UK history-hating authoritarians and operate your business normally!
1324396392719278088 2020-11-06 01:01:20 +0800 <SteveCass14> @85Alive85 It was never realistic to think that 'any deal' would be deemed better than 'no deal'. The EU found a weak prime minster in Mrs May &amp; a pro-Remain Commons. They sought to take advantage instead of being reasonable. The Dec 2019 GE changed the UK situation &amp; we are where we are.
1324357124160393216 2020-11-05 22:25:18 +0800 <SteveCass14> @85Alive85 Agree that no-one tried to rig the Brexit ref vote at the ballot box. All the more reason why the vote of the majority, however small, should be accepted. It's not democracy if you don't. Personally, I would have set a 66% threshold to leave the EU but it was 50.1% &amp; I accept it
1324353682025185280 2020-11-05 22:11:37 +0800 <SteveCass14> When you KNOW you're right, the ends justify the means. Simple as that!
1324271495112204289 2020-11-05 16:45:02 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. Appeasement of authoritarians never works (other than for the authoritarians of course).
1323991715158626306 2020-11-04 22:13:18 +0800 <SteveCass14> Not wrong!
1323671548532764675 2020-11-04 01:01:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. Aligned to this is that too many pretend that complex nuanced problems are actually very easy with a simple silver-bullet solution. Intellectual laziness or simply agenda driven thinking?
1323311189288488972 2020-11-03 01:09:08 +0800 <SteveCass14> Naughty!! 😉
1323227276285235202 2020-11-02 19:35:41 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. 'cos one it will be you!
1323020408287858697 2020-11-02 05:53:40 +0800 <SteveCass14> It would certainly up the ante if people knew that their crime would affect more than just themselves.
1323014371849719808 2020-11-02 05:29:41 +0800 <SteveCass14> Actually, I think I know what it is. Middle-class guilt (why FFS??!!) The logic(?) is this; if I talk a socialist game it absolves me of the guilt I feel while not requiring me to actually change my comfortable capitalist middle-class life in any meaningful way. Pathetic!
1322922233887686657 2020-11-01 23:23:33 +0800 <SteveCass14> I now know TWO people in my small town who frequently make their socialist views clear while working for Independent (i.e. private/fee paying) schools. Hypocrisy, lack of self-awareness, inability to see personal irony? Geez!!
1322431942642597888 2020-10-31 14:55:19 +0800 <SteveCass14> Equally importantly, they tend to have decent sized gardens compared to houses built in the last 20 years.
1322120093250322432 2020-10-30 18:16:08 +0800 <SteveCass14> very sad but I fear, true!
1322114786033913856 2020-10-30 17:55:03 +0800 <SteveCass14> @ChablisPablis Oh dear!!
1322089542736846855 2020-10-30 16:14:44 +0800 <SteveCass14> One set of rules for the progressive activists and a different set that they are happy to try and impose on everyone else. Hypocrisy is the bedfellow of illogical, contradictory &amp; self-referential cults.
1322088070473285633 2020-10-30 16:08:53 +0800 <SteveCass14> The more their bias is pointed out, the more they double-down, instead of accepting the criticism and making more effort at genuine balance. Arrogance or cowardice, I wonder?
1321858457889345538 2020-10-30 00:56:29 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed!
1321780882324267008 2020-10-29 19:48:14 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes, well, I'm afraid I am suspicious of that lady and her motives.
1321776725827747840 2020-10-29 19:31:43 +0800 <SteveCass14> yes!
1321454227831640064 2020-10-28 22:10:14 +0800 <SteveCass14> Fair enough!
1321369753760501761 2020-10-28 16:34:33 +0800 <SteveCass14> I had a discussion of Fb about this a year or so ago. I pointed out the illegality and all the parents said they didn't care, it's safer for their kids to ride on the pavement. Go figure!
1321085239964389378 2020-10-27 21:44:00 +0800 <SteveCass14> It's certainly the point of view of many millions.
1321084835927121922 2020-10-27 21:42:24 +0800 <SteveCass14> @C4M53883828 A good start. Easier to say than to make happen of course but as I say, some good ideas.
1321084574772928515 2020-10-27 21:41:21 +0800 <SteveCass14> Correct. And the same applies to trans-men of course. Women are women. There are no "special cases" of adult human female who are somehow "not women".
1321057124181573640 2020-10-27 19:52:17 +0800 <SteveCass14> @MaajidNawaz @QuilliamOrg OK Maajid, I'll take a look. But if there are reasonable policy solutions out there, they need to be pushed hard &amp; constantly on social media &amp; MSM because most people wouldn't know about them and their instinct is an extreme solution.
1321056348562489345 2020-10-27 19:49:12 +0800 <SteveCass14> True, sadly.
1321045836629987329 2020-10-27 19:07:25 +0800 <SteveCass14> YIKES!!
1321045773971324934 2020-10-27 19:07:11 +0800 <SteveCass14> But it's a great test of how far authoritarianism can be pushed without significant complaint from the people isn't it?
1321011626527674368 2020-10-27 16:51:29 +0800 <SteveCass14> We should think very carefully before making statements we know a lot won't agree with. However, having engaged brain, if you decide to say it anyway, then own it. Don't say what you think &amp; then apologise when you get the pushback you knew you would get. Explain your position.
1320771707842473984 2020-10-27 00:58:08 +0800 <SteveCass14> It would certainly be an understandable reaction.
1320770746172477441 2020-10-27 00:54:19 +0800 <SteveCass14> True, sadly.
1320688116378804224 2020-10-26 19:25:58 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1320683354702925824 2020-10-26 19:07:03 +0800 <SteveCass14> yes!
1320462043108036608 2020-10-26 04:27:38 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes!!
1319377648976597011 2020-10-23 04:38:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> yes!
1319369327481683969 2020-10-23 04:05:35 +0800 <SteveCass14> And that takes some doing!😀
1319368887700496385 2020-10-23 04:03:50 +0800 <SteveCass14> Good old Jethro!
1319323107971170306 2020-10-23 01:01:55 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1319235799448158209 2020-10-22 19:14:59 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes, I agree. Heads I win tails you lose is a lousy position for anyone to take. Black people only count when they have Left-wing political views? WTF??!!
1319235391396917248 2020-10-22 19:13:22 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed.
1319235301244534788 2020-10-22 19:13:00 +0800 <SteveCass14> YES!!
1319234961266921472 2020-10-22 19:11:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> Why is it that when you give people something for nothing, they're grateful for a short while, but soon decide they are entitled to it and complain when the free stuff gets removed?
1319233302235123712 2020-10-22 19:05:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> Who knew?? 😀
1319232675874484224 2020-10-22 19:02:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> Would be funny if it wasn't true?
1319232027925905410 2020-10-22 19:00:00 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Femi_Sorry @KemiBadenoch Keep talking. It does your opponents the world of good!
1319231737717805057 2020-10-22 18:58:51 +0800 <SteveCass14> Of course he is. Spouting divisisve views is his purpose in life it seems.
1319231469429153792 2020-10-22 18:57:47 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed!  https://t.co/DVnnE52PIp
1319231197072031744 2020-10-22 18:56:42 +0800 <SteveCass14> Hate having to self-censor BUT it would affect my wife who has to work with this person. A female 50 something indoctrinated in a late 70s female only universtity. Tells those who disagree with her rad fem socialism that she's more intelligent so they should shut up. WTF?😒
1319194811572903944 2020-10-22 16:32:07 +0800 <SteveCass14> Intresting change in attitude since.
1318997537647460355 2020-10-22 03:28:13 +0800 <SteveCass14> Says it all!
1318996881775579136 2020-10-22 03:25:37 +0800 <SteveCass14> Unless this guy is full of s*it, we're in big troule as a society!  https://t.co/O8MlkaZxmj
1318930975863222272 2020-10-21 23:03:43 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣
1318930936726233091 2020-10-21 23:03:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣
1318930484777406464 2020-10-21 23:01:46 +0800 <SteveCass14> No, I really don't think He has anyting to do with it. 😀
1318929848421781514 2020-10-21 22:59:15 +0800 <SteveCass14> 😀
1318895063628382208 2020-10-21 20:41:01 +0800 <SteveCass14> OUCH!!!
1318894525750910976 2020-10-21 20:38:53 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes but arrogance and hypocrisy usually come in equal measure, so we shouldn't be surprised.
1318893860886544384 2020-10-21 20:36:14 +0800 <SteveCass14> True.
1318893272857718785 2020-10-21 20:33:54 +0800 <SteveCass14> Very good. Like that. Always be wary of those who volunteer to tell everyone else what to do!
1318892577286967305 2020-10-21 20:31:08 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed.
1318828910155620352 2020-10-21 16:18:09 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes. About time too!
1318825858593861632 2020-10-21 16:06:01 +0800 <SteveCass14> Is that it??
1318810223583334401 2020-10-21 15:03:54 +0800 <SteveCass14> It's certainly possible. 😉
1318809975662194688 2020-10-21 15:02:55 +0800 <SteveCass14> @IMcMillan You don't live near me then, Ian. Pouring wth rain and will continue to do so all day! 😀
1318805513157644288 2020-10-21 14:45:11 +0800 <SteveCass14> @SVPhillimore Delusion does complicate matters, I agree. But is it delusion or calculated social politics with an agenda, I wonder?
1318805185599311873 2020-10-21 14:43:53 +0800 <SteveCass14> @noelplum has various you tube videos explaining why PZ Myers is not to be listened to seriously.
1318804464032227330 2020-10-21 14:41:01 +0800 <SteveCass14> It certainly doesn't seem difficult to distinguish between these things, I agree.
1318802720506216449 2020-10-21 14:34:05 +0800 <SteveCass14> Isn't this a simple statement of biological fact? What's controversial about it?
1318801910158196737 2020-10-21 14:30:52 +0800 <SteveCass14> If you want to retweet without necessarily seeming to  endorse, it looks like we have to spend time explaining why. A deliberate ploy to reduce the number of retweets of what twitter sees as controversial views I suspect. Some won't want to put their heads above the parapet.
1318799601026084864 2020-10-21 14:21:41 +0800 <SteveCass14> @hellium_w The breadth of human behaviour is vast. There are many humans who would not behave in these self-serving ways. We should be wary of those who volunteer to have power over others and, because of that power, expect higher than average standards, i.e. to set a good example. No?
1318642856316329984 2020-10-21 03:58:50 +0800 <SteveCass14> Why can't politicians just behave like decent people for those they represent to look up to instead of seeing how they can use/abuse the system to the greatest financial advantage possible?
1318642191422676993 2020-10-21 03:56:12 +0800 <SteveCass14> True
1318641755563151360 2020-10-21 03:54:28 +0800 <SteveCass14> Interesting!
1318637144110452737 2020-10-21 03:36:08 +0800 <SteveCass14> Must be considered carefully.
1318635871659347968 2020-10-21 03:31:05 +0800 <SteveCass14> @TheVietGwent Agreed.
1318281686849814528 2020-10-20 04:03:41 +0800 <SteveCass14> And when the crime is committed by a certain colour!
1318281131939274753 2020-10-20 04:01:28 +0800 <SteveCass14> Those who approve of/see no problem with the sexualisation of children or those who simply don't think about the ramifications.
1318280393963995138 2020-10-20 03:58:33 +0800 <SteveCass14> The trouble is that many fill the religious hole not with traditional religion or sprituality but with secular political ideologies that are more like destructive cults.
1318252089118760960 2020-10-20 02:06:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> @HHepplewhite We can but hope. However, the decline in church attendance/ identifying as Christian in the 10 yearly census has been going the wrong way since WW2. What will change that do you think?
1318250633774927877 2020-10-20 02:00:17 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agree but that horse bolted long ago. Less than 50% even identify as Christian now and only about 10% of those go to church on anything other than an occasional basis. Sad but true. Can't see people turning back to Christianity in any meaningful numbers I'm afraid.
1318250018084655111 2020-10-20 01:57:50 +0800 <SteveCass14> I am an Anglican but, very sadly, I agree with you.
1318249334601900032 2020-10-20 01:55:07 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣🤣🤣
1318239502985515010 2020-10-20 01:16:03 +0800 <SteveCass14> I've said before on Twitter that in my opinion, bearing in mind they are taxpayer funded, there is no job in the BBC that is so important or difficult that a salary of more than £100,000pa is justifiable.
1318238844668567552 2020-10-20 01:13:26 +0800 <SteveCass14> The leaders of the Church of England are no different from the managerial/technocratic elite class in the secular sphere, so no surprise that they behave in the same way and have the same general attitudes.
1317751229074841601 2020-10-18 16:55:50 +0800 <SteveCass14> It's almost as if political ideologues are disingenuously using certain killings to promote their politics. The deaths that offer a conduit to promote those politics get as much attention as they want; those that don't are soon passed over or even ignored. Can't be true though!😉
1317722465259356166 2020-10-18 15:01:32 +0800 <SteveCass14> Somewhat ironic, I agree!
1317720503705083904 2020-10-18 14:53:44 +0800 <SteveCass14> Original post didn't mention Unions. The implication was that every individual teacher needs to come on social media &amp; say they're horrified- or if not what? They are by default quite happy about it? We want action to combat the mindset that led to this murder not mere signalling
1317715560235438080 2020-10-18 14:34:06 +0800 <SteveCass14> OUCH!!!!!!
1317714548967735296 2020-10-18 14:30:05 +0800 <SteveCass14> Are you suggesting it's more a performance in weaponsing supposed victimhood than a logical and genuinely held view? How very dare you! 😀
1317712898513424386 2020-10-18 14:23:31 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Scion_of_Zion @hellium_w Closed-minded ideologues always defend a fellow ideologue irrespective of what they do. They wouldn't be closed-minded ideologues if they didn't! 😒
1317711660400914434 2020-10-18 14:18:36 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed.
1317562776873848832 2020-10-18 04:26:59 +0800 <SteveCass14> @COLRICHARDKEMP And you call stating the obvious on social media 'doing something'? Why should we have to come on twitter and state that we don't agree with murder?
1317560209108324356 2020-10-18 04:16:47 +0800 <SteveCass14> @COLRICHARDKEMP @EdwardoYazzie What do you expect teahcers to say? Surely you take it as read that they're horrified by it. Why is stating the bloody obvious on social media necessary?
1317558476818829312 2020-10-18 04:09:54 +0800 <SteveCass14> @t0nyyates @Jamin2g China, No and things aren't bad enough yet. Next question?
1317511233252347916 2020-10-18 01:02:10 +0800 <SteveCass14> @chadfelixg What a great thread. Thanks!
1317471614385201153 2020-10-17 22:24:44 +0800 <SteveCass14> @LanceForman @GSBradley1 They want as much restriction as possible that doesn't affect their life in any meaningful way.
1317431076147658754 2020-10-17 19:43:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> @davison_al @GuidoFawkes Is there such a thing? wow, how exciting!! 🤣😀
1317430578497585152 2020-10-17 19:41:41 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. Actual physical safety versus hurt feelings. If you have to choose, &amp; we do in this case because there is no sensible compromise, then you're a strange person to put hurt feelings ahead of physical safety. It would almost suggest you had an ulterior motive - surely not!😉
1317429249943478273 2020-10-17 19:36:24 +0800 <SteveCass14> @davison_al @GuidoFawkes The originla is a parody and I was only saying they can't rap with tongue in cheek and for fun. I think you may be taking this a little too seriously. 😀
1317428785118064640 2020-10-17 19:34:33 +0800 <SteveCass14> @SmokinKones 🤣🤣🤣🤣 And a nasty child who can only throw out slurs. Really quite pathetic. 🤣🤣🤣
1317405656014573568 2020-10-17 18:02:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> @MongKinky @uk_sf_writer @BBCNews People who take up extreme/fundamentalist positions (i.e. with no nuance/compromise), are extremists simply by definition. I don't think complex problems are best solved either by pretending that they're not complex &amp;/or with one-size-fits-all silver bullet simplistic solutions.
1317403170998542337 2020-10-17 17:52:46 +0800 <SteveCass14> @davison_al @GuidoFawkes Well I'm of an age when M C Hammer, Coolio &amp; then Eminem were at their best. Then in the 2000s, Lil Wayne &amp; 50 cent. But I don't claim to be an expert on rap, I just know what I like and when someone's trying to rap who can't 😀
1317401909255430144 2020-10-17 17:47:45 +0800 <SteveCass14> @SmokinKones Grow-up. Not everyone is a closed-minded political obsessive. I follow Corbyn, Starmer. Owen Jones &amp; many others because I want to hear all sides.
1317383976311554048 2020-10-17 16:36:30 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes. Deliberately constructing a situation whereby you can claim ignorance or lack of verifiable information is not an acceptable way for any Government to behave.
1317376982712279040 2020-10-17 16:08:43 +0800 <SteveCass14> But you're not holding your breath are you, Paul?
1317374484232523778 2020-10-17 15:58:47 +0800 <SteveCass14> @uk_sf_writer @Farmo05 @BBCNews The bubonic plague was simply a recognisable example, which I'm sure you realised. The point which you haven't attempted to refute is that we seem to be treating covid as if it's killing large %ages of the population when it clearly isn't. I just want a sensible explanation.Fair?
1317355898289987584 2020-10-17 14:44:56 +0800 <SteveCass14> Only extremists say covid is just like flu. However, if you draw a line with the bubonic plague (est 30-50% death rate) at one end and seasonal Flu at the other, Covid is way down toward the flu end, yet it's being treated more like it's the plague. That's what needs explaining.
1317354908073558016 2020-10-17 14:41:00 +0800 <SteveCass14> @uk_sf_writer @BBCNews Only extremists say covid is just like flu. However, if you draw a line with the bubonic plague (est 30-50% death rate) at one end and seasonal Flu at the other, Covid is way down toward the flu end, yet it's being treated more like it's the plague. That's what needs explaining.
1317162476581040130 2020-10-17 01:56:20 +0800 <SteveCass14> The Corbynistas really don;t like Starmer do they? And they can't rap either! 😉Keir Starmer: Bossy Cop  https://t.co/V03YY8ne6w via @guidofawkes
1317153612699701248 2020-10-17 01:21:07 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes. It's not a difficult concept to understand is it?
1317046479488536576 2020-10-16 18:15:24 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed.
1317043460449406978 2020-10-16 18:03:25 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes. The Leftward march of educationalists since WW2 will have a lot to do with it.
1317039813221097472 2020-10-16 17:48:55 +0800 <SteveCass14> The restrictions ARE clearly a loss of freedom because you can't do some things you used to be able to do. The debate is about whether the loss of freedom is justified or not and opinions are polarised on that.
1317038224989163521 2020-10-16 17:42:36 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes, because the rigid ideological monoculture they promote is the one that suits them. Never be surprised at those who claim the moral high ground as long as it suits their own interests.
1317036577202339840 2020-10-16 17:36:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> Are you suggesting that a lot of the BBC's political &amp; cultural biases are merely performative (i.e. those at the top don't really believe it)? My fear is that they DO believe it!
1317032126559211523 2020-10-16 17:18:22 +0800 <SteveCass14> @DanielJHannan @BeesWax2017 @maillotorange @wallaceme @tomhfh @james_tooley How do mobile phones raise living standards, Dan? Fascinated to find out.
1317030877277335552 2020-10-16 17:13:25 +0800 <SteveCass14> Pushback from within the medical profession ramping up in many countries!
1317025567267573761 2020-10-16 16:52:19 +0800 <SteveCass14> It's not a situation where technically OUT but in practice IN would work politically in the UK. We're now in a position whereby all the way out &amp; then negotiate in good faith but walk away if the deal isn't good enough is the only realistic way forward. Sad perhaps, but true!
1317016823343308800 2020-10-16 16:17:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> Hmm... Interesting!
1317015620572119041 2020-10-16 16:12:47 +0800 <SteveCass14> It's bizarre, frankly. That a middle class TV presenter gets a kick of moral superiority out of making racially devisive statements that don't stand-up to reasonable scrutiny just makes you shake your head in sadness &amp; disbelief that anyone could be so silly.
1317012445781688321 2020-10-16 16:00:10 +0800 <SteveCass14> He loves being Scottish so much that he ditched his Dundee accent and made himself sound like a middle class home counties Englishman. Neither (I believe) does he even own a property in Scotland, just the USA and London. The irony will be lost on him &amp; the SNP of course! 🤣😉
1317009140376588289 2020-10-16 15:47:02 +0800 <SteveCass14> While I tend towards agreeing with you, across my various social medias, I know a lot of people who think very differently. I think there will be more deaths &amp; blighted lives caused by another lockdown than by covid but the opposite view is by no means just a small minority.
1317005719862939649 2020-10-16 15:33:27 +0800 <SteveCass14> @UKurbanite @redundantuk @ajayjagota Yes. I think we have an elitist managerial/technocratic class that have power through all our major institutions &amp; companies. They believe that their globalist/'one-world' liberal views are correct &amp; are making them happen even though they know the majority don't agree.
1317002336007540737 2020-10-16 15:20:00 +0800 <SteveCass14> @mrsray77008554 Agreed. We live in a society where the younger generations (middle class?) feel entitled. Life should be easy &amp; nothing bad should ever happen. If it does, 'someone else' (usually the Government) should step in and make the bad thing go away. Fragility being pushed &amp; weaponised..
1317000665277845504 2020-10-16 15:13:21 +0800 <SteveCass14> I wonder who she's trying to impress or why it makes her feel good about herself to make these kind of divisive statements?
1316998909802270720 2020-10-16 15:06:23 +0800 <SteveCass14> @mrsray77008554 Agreed. However, who gets to decide what is a necessity and what is a luxury? For example, there are many who would claim that a TV and a mobile phone are necessities these days.
1316697090500833280 2020-10-15 19:07:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> Many people can't see past their own situation or past the thing immediately in front of them (covid). The deaths, mental health issues, unemployment/deprevation caused by focussing solely on covid just seem to get ignored. Neither society nor economy can afford another lockdown!
1316625728780333056 2020-10-15 14:23:30 +0800 <SteveCass14> Brilliant!
1316457521499041792 2020-10-15 03:15:06 +0800 <SteveCass14> Nah! He'd rather just propagandise. Less effort 😉
1316450673941151756 2020-10-15 02:47:53 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Femi_Sorry @y_alibhai What an unpleasant person you are!
1316375145318055938 2020-10-14 21:47:46 +0800 <SteveCass14> Ah... so the way to beat prejudice by a small minority of white people is not to advocate to STOP prejudice but to advocate FOR prejudice but simply reverse its direction. And MPs wonder why they're held in such low regard.
1316374974370807808 2020-10-14 21:47:05 +0800 <SteveCass14> Ah... so the way to beat prejudice by a small minority of white people is not to advocate to STOP prejudice but to advocate FOR prejudice but simply reverse its direction. And MPs wonder why they're held in such low regard.
1316320487732117505 2020-10-14 18:10:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> OUCH!! 😀
1316059860715397120 2020-10-14 00:54:56 +0800 <SteveCass14> brilliant explanation of what's going on!
1316042850489036800 2020-10-13 23:47:21 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1315733612877275143 2020-10-13 03:18:33 +0800 <SteveCass14> @honestrainbow They're anti biological science, certainly. I'm sure some are also the other things you mention but it's all grounded in the scientific factual lie that biology isn't real or doesn't matter. All that matters is to have their delusion validated by forcing others to join in the lie
1315682949044592641 2020-10-12 23:57:13 +0800 <SteveCass14> There's none so hateful &amp; exclusive as those who proclaim themselves to be the most kind, tolerant &amp; inclusive.
1315568553664434176 2020-10-12 16:22:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Generali11 @Obsolesence @WorldRugby You are correct but I'm not sure what point you're wanting to make. It's either ok for biological males with the physical strength benefits that this brings to play contact sports against biological women or it isn't. If it's not ok, then it's not ok for 1000 or 100 or 10 or 1.
1315552245249966081 2020-10-12 15:17:51 +0800 <SteveCass14> Very good! Thanks.
1315369409888890880 2020-10-12 03:11:20 +0800 <SteveCass14> Well said. Tarring ALL men with the same brush as the minority of bas****s and blaming misogyny for almost every ill in society is both untrue and counter-productive. I can only assume it makes some feel better to do so.
1315328791577792514 2020-10-12 00:29:56 +0800 <SteveCass14> @HeatherEHeying @BretWeinstein You may not be aware of these guys. They are trying to have a civilised conversation about the current political ideologies. But you/Bret/Eric &amp; the IDW are mentioned in mildly critical terms around or soon after 1 hr 10 mins. You may find it interesting. 😃
1314954605248344065 2020-10-10 23:43:03 +0800 <SteveCass14> Perhaps it's the difference between practical, common sense people and bitter people with a sense of entitlement.
1314870057361715207 2020-10-10 18:07:05 +0800 <SteveCass14> Interesting!
1314869917494149122 2020-10-10 18:06:32 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣
1314868617566138368 2020-10-10 18:01:22 +0800 <SteveCass14> That would require a) self-awareness and b) giving a monkeys what those who disagree with them think and why.
1314855368548376577 2020-10-10 17:08:43 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. And surely he's got the wit to realise that.
1314664022277599233 2020-10-10 04:28:22 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1314632125057044482 2020-10-10 02:21:37 +0800 <SteveCass14> It doesn't surprise me. I long ago stoppped believing that MPs are toward the upper end of the intelligence or self-awareness scales
1314575467941433344 2020-10-09 22:36:29 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1314511418520227841 2020-10-09 18:21:59 +0800 <SteveCass14> @JohnImrie10 @JuliaHB1 Possibly. An even easier way is to either compulsory purchase or mandate landowners to allow solar panels in all fields (where possible) to the side of motorways/dual carrriageways. These roads are already an eyesore, so adding solar panels for 100m each side wouldn't matter.
1314509027615875072 2020-10-09 18:12:29 +0800 <SteveCass14> @JohnImrie10 @JuliaHB1 A nice thought but only the large global banks/corporations have the kind of money to pay for this without it resulting in either increased taxes across the board or goods &amp; services becoming more expensive. And it's the increases in these costs that the poorest can't cope with!
1314504114315853826 2020-10-09 17:52:57 +0800 <SteveCass14> @JohnImrie10 @JuliaHB1 It's not that simple, John. The costs/societal upheaval required to move as far/fast as the environmentalists want are huge &amp; we need a compromise. We can't throw the baby out with the bathwater. It's always the poorest that bear the main burden of high cost large scale change.
1314501513591619584 2020-10-09 17:42:37 +0800 <SteveCass14> They're not very good at this communications lark are they? Constantly giving people a reason to question their motives is just stupid!!
1314501007368491015 2020-10-09 17:40:37 +0800 <SteveCass14> It would certainly be interesting!!
1314471032800137217 2020-10-09 15:41:30 +0800 <SteveCass14> @DaveAtherton20 You forgot China which was (&amp; still is? - Uiyghurs?) responsible for the deaths of more of its own people than any other regime that has ever existed.
1314465920346206209 2020-10-09 15:21:11 +0800 <SteveCass14> Very nice! I like that. But of course, whose fault is that? If we don't vote for people that make us uncomfortable by telling us what we DON'T want to hear, then we bring the hustlers on oursleves. A dichotomy hard to solve.
1314461502817136641 2020-10-09 15:03:38 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. Political ideology should have no place within the law.
1314291192209825793 2020-10-09 03:46:53 +0800 <SteveCass14> @christianjbdev Err.. no, don't think Jesus has much to do with it! 😃
1314290656261660673 2020-10-09 03:44:45 +0800 <SteveCass14> @debra_peine Gotcha! Thanks. 😀
1314290264031277057 2020-10-09 03:43:11 +0800 <SteveCass14> @debra_peine I get confused. What is the actual biological sex of a trans dyke??!!
1314245012104900608 2020-10-09 00:43:23 +0800 <SteveCass14> @JolyonMaugham @AlanMur67591225 It's the catatrophising message that needs to be banned, not him personally. As with racism &amp; transgenderism, eco-warriors are over-playing their hand &amp; getting push-back. All extremism, whatever cause they promote, should be resisted. We can make progress without all the mayhem
1314239044021256193 2020-10-09 00:19:40 +0800 <SteveCass14> Don't ask awkard questions! Just accept what you're told unconditionally!! 😉
1314238786306441219 2020-10-09 00:18:38 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. Why do so many think they gain some form of credit by being plain nasty?
1314235460747657217 2020-10-09 00:05:25 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. It's not acceptable from anyone, irrespective of their political views.
1314233291327901698 2020-10-08 23:56:48 +0800 <SteveCass14> Good but try thinking before you tweet!
1314233143734472707 2020-10-08 23:56:13 +0800 <SteveCass14> But it's only the rad fems that promote it. The vast majority of women just want equal opportunities (which they now have) and certainly don't hate men or blame them for all the ills of society.
1314231398761467904 2020-10-08 23:49:17 +0800 <SteveCass14> @CaiaCaecilia I guess we will. 😀
1314222252498579458 2020-10-08 23:12:56 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes but hypocrisy is the stock in trade of tunel-visioned activists. Whether they do it knowingly or it's a total lack of self-awareness, I don't know. Some of each I expect.
1314196212044763137 2020-10-08 21:29:28 +0800 <SteveCass14> @CaiaCaecilia I'm not being flippant. Some people only see covid. Others see the harm of mental illness &amp; economic despair caused by the lockdown. To ignore these issues &amp; just focus on covid would only be right if the death rate was much higher. Long covid? Only in the seriously affected.
1314170264935165953 2020-10-08 19:46:21 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes. This smacks of ideology winning out over common sense.
1314169394642259968 2020-10-08 19:42:54 +0800 <SteveCass14> @CaiaCaecilia I was talking specifically about whether the elderly/vulnerable people should be forced by the State to isolate. THEY are the ones most at risk not younger healthy people. I think we need to trust them &amp; their families/carers to do what's right for them while considering others.
1314148204045381637 2020-10-08 18:18:42 +0800 <SteveCass14> OK but, why 'political' interests? To me this is about a moral/ethical view. Those who believe they were born in the wrong body should be cared for &amp; helped psychologically but not allowed to ride roughshod over the rights of the biological sexes who accout for 99%+ of people.
1313924717305356288 2020-10-08 03:30:38 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣🤣
1313924222423568384 2020-10-08 03:28:40 +0800 <SteveCass14> Or, from the medics viewpoint, to show how progressive and liberal they are!
1313881070958452738 2020-10-08 00:37:12 +0800 <SteveCass14> @NikkiStix55 @KingBobIIV Agreed. What I do know though is that if you face a challenge like unemployment with defeatism &amp; bitterness as your key attitudes, it won't work out well for you or others. The change only need be temporary. Or they could do creative stuff outdoors or online like some comedians.
1313878647976198144 2020-10-08 00:27:35 +0800 <SteveCass14> Intresting!
1313878484901670917 2020-10-08 00:26:56 +0800 <SteveCass14> Exactly so, Alistair. The issue is what to do if the BBC refuses to move away from it's current non-balanced, finger-wagging course?
1313877575580758017 2020-10-08 00:23:19 +0800 <SteveCass14> @NikkiStix55 @KingBobIIV Yes they are worried. Who wouldn't be but no-one has the right to refuse to change direction in life just because it's difficult. I've been made redundant twice and I had to move into a different industry once &amp; started my own company the other time. Stressful &amp; scary but doable.
1313876326500139009 2020-10-08 00:18:21 +0800 <SteveCass14> He certainly comes across that way.
1313875717562732549 2020-10-08 00:15:56 +0800 <SteveCass14> How do so many organisations get taken over by those who are, or are supportive of, such a small group of people the main contention of which is blatantly anti-science &amp;blatantly impinging on the rights of the biological sexes?(Don't forget tran-men though they cause less issues)
1313873431616786438 2020-10-08 00:06:51 +0800 <SteveCass14> Since when do any of us have the right to expect never to have to change direction in life just because it would be difficult or awkward or our pride would be hurt?
1313870939621294081 2020-10-07 23:56:57 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. Why they think they'll make more money by pissing off the majority, I have no Idea but you're right, they wouldn't be doing it if they thought their profits would go down!
1313785137025495041 2020-10-07 18:16:00 +0800 <SteveCass14> Even those on the Left are happy with capitalism when it works to their own advantage!
1313764005421428736 2020-10-07 16:52:02 +0800 <SteveCass14> The answer to racism against ethnic minorities is.....wait for it..... racism BY ethnic minorities! Yea! That'll sort it out! What planet are these people on?
1313744406239993859 2020-10-07 15:34:09 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed!
1313514164426625026 2020-10-07 00:19:15 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Crosscolin88 @richard_bishop1 Literally impossible!!
1313487818895826946 2020-10-06 22:34:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> It's not necessarily against the interests of the resident British but the way it has been done has made that interpretation very easy to make.
1313422281293651970 2020-10-06 18:14:08 +0800 <SteveCass14> @johnestevens So what? Get a life!
1313391898955001858 2020-10-06 16:13:25 +0800 <SteveCass14> Of course. All zealots have zero self-awareness!
1313390814681333763 2020-10-06 16:09:06 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. When the only way you can think of to combat something is to do the same but in reverse, I'm not convinced you're on the side of the angels!
1313386418652286977 2020-10-06 15:51:38 +0800 <SteveCass14> Great thread!
1313385639358926848 2020-10-06 15:48:32 +0800 <SteveCass14> I don't think being responsible enters the heads of people who use words like racist, fascist, etc as a weapon. They couldn't care less. They know they are right - end of thought process.
1313378231601463296 2020-10-06 15:19:06 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Lance63 @Jonathan_K_Cook @AlanMur67591225 @TheLancet That is naive I'm afraid. We all know that, rightly or wrongly, anything that involves Israel or Gaza is immediately politicized by one party or the other. Too many hitherto non-political publications seem to have politicized people at their head who deliberately put politics in.
1313376589024034816 2020-10-06 15:12:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> Spot on!
1313205817928224769 2020-10-06 03:53:59 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Jonathan_K_Cook @AlanMur67591225 How about The Lancet stays out of of politics altogether? Problem solved!
1313136025154334723 2020-10-05 23:16:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> Pure narcissism!
1313133290480689152 2020-10-05 23:05:47 +0800 <SteveCass14> My question is, 'what do they think they gain by coddling the trans delusion?' They are such a small percentage of the population, I don't see what they have to gain by pissing off the majority (i.e. females &amp; males).
1313103880146780167 2020-10-05 21:08:55 +0800 <SteveCass14> Sometimes it's the only way people learn.
1313079602823168001 2020-10-05 19:32:27 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣🤣🤣
1312851440579289089 2020-10-05 04:25:49 +0800 <SteveCass14> They never give evidence because there isn't any. It's another attempt to frighten people/companies/organisations into shunning anyone who holds views they don't agree with.
1312848494756073473 2020-10-05 04:14:07 +0800 <SteveCass14> Even if they convince you that they really believe they are women, they are in fact, not. That's a biological fact. Defend biological female rights while you still can. Being 'nice'or 'caring' should not stretch to giving away your hard-won rights to men, which is what they are.
1312845263044849673 2020-10-05 04:01:16 +0800 <SteveCass14> @suchan104 @nicolathorp_ yes but if racist segregation is being done with good intentions, that's ok.............err, apparently!
1312842274632617990 2020-10-05 03:49:24 +0800 <SteveCass14> @lascapigliata8 An interesting take. I see the point. Either trans is a legitimate thing or it isn't. And if it isn't, then that goes for those allying with the rights of biological females &amp; children as much as for those opposing them. Food for thought.
1312794805982896129 2020-10-05 00:40:46 +0800 <SteveCass14> @BlondeKbf Yes. Was discussing C20th fascist &amp; communist regimes &amp; got told that the way communist/fascist regimes operated in practice were not the same. I listed all the ways that such regimes, when in power, acted in exactly the same way &amp; they didn't respond. Facts don't fit their views
1312743136272306176 2020-10-04 21:15:27 +0800 <SteveCass14> @SilkCutBlue @GoodwinMJ @WingPiglet Things certainly allow this interpretation at the moment.
1312741430880854016 2020-10-04 21:08:41 +0800 <SteveCass14> @BlondeKbf I should think so. Now get educated and don't do it again!! 🤣🤣
1312741168711634950 2020-10-04 21:07:38 +0800 <SteveCass14> It shouldn't of course but the problem is that the way things are going, it does!
1312740764695355392 2020-10-04 21:06:02 +0800 <SteveCass14> Doesn't it make you sick?
1312739237427580929 2020-10-04 20:59:58 +0800 <SteveCass14> Please be quiet. That's far too sensible a statement. You're upsetting the socialist luvvies!
1312738506280763392 2020-10-04 20:57:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> How dare you disseminate facts that don't fit the current narrative?!!! 😉
1312716737440354304 2020-10-04 19:30:33 +0800 <SteveCass14> @KeillerDon They lack self-awareness and get caught up by their own self-importance; self-righteousness even. It's not a mental illness so much as the consequence of not living in the  world that 90% of us inhabit.
1312714297097834496 2020-10-04 19:20:52 +0800 <SteveCass14> trying to have it both ways.
1312713969975676928 2020-10-04 19:19:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> @teresadg0 @kitty_kat_nat_ They're so lacking in self-awareness and so caught up in their own righteousness that it won't even have occurred to them!
1312713626281705472 2020-10-04 19:18:12 +0800 <SteveCass14> @quintondicky @jeffjames49 But as with the whole patrician managerial elite, these things don't apply to them, only to the plebs.
1312712493828124678 2020-10-04 19:13:42 +0800 <SteveCass14> @FabulousMrsFox @RejectIdeology @LozzaFox You could well be right! 😀
1312673952167325696 2020-10-04 16:40:33 +0800 <SteveCass14> certainly for those that commute into cities.
1312673594896461825 2020-10-04 16:39:07 +0800 <SteveCass14> @FabulousMrsFox @RejectIdeology It's the fact that they can't see the irony or the damage they are doing that isn't funny. The photo is hilarious!! 😀
1312672953427988487 2020-10-04 16:36:35 +0800 <SteveCass14> @ChablisPablis Yes, but not the fact that they simply don't see it! 😀
1312668254310199296 2020-10-04 16:17:54 +0800 <SteveCass14> OUCH!!
1312492490209984512 2020-10-04 04:39:29 +0800 <SteveCass14> Good manners? Sorry, that's well out of date. Can you explain the concept? 😉
1312492185913225216 2020-10-04 04:38:16 +0800 <SteveCass14> Spot on Andy
1312491372222398464 2020-10-04 04:35:02 +0800 <SteveCass14> You would think so, but then we're not extremists that want to bring liberal democracy down.
1312490820382023680 2020-10-04 04:32:51 +0800 <SteveCass14> Will do! 🤣
1312490446610817024 2020-10-04 04:31:22 +0800 <SteveCass14> @ALLIANCELGB @edeysal @AusHandball Only the 'Ts' count as you folk realise more than most!
1312489651660177408 2020-10-04 04:28:12 +0800 <SteveCass14> @mynonsensetogo @abline11 Only William has a real purpose in life, to be King. Harry has no purpose &amp; thus is susceptible to being led astray. In this respect, he's no different to the rest of us. The most disaffected are those with no sense of purpose/meaning. They crave it &amp; can be taken in by cults.
1312488259432271874 2020-10-04 04:22:40 +0800 <SteveCass14> Brilliant! Good for you for pointing out the stupidity of companies doing stuff like this!
1312486851819704320 2020-10-04 04:17:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> @demi_lynne701 @John197914 The woke Left, yes. there are many on the Left who aren't with the woke mob.
1312486049986220033 2020-10-04 04:13:53 +0800 <SteveCass14> These are the compaasionate people. Did you forget? 😉
1312485865306812416 2020-10-04 04:13:09 +0800 <SteveCass14> No, No! These are the kind, caring people, remember? 😉
1312483569550331904 2020-10-04 04:04:02 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Ash_Hirani @TimePartyUK @TheSDPUK @thereclaimparty @UKLabour Who'd have thunk it?!
1312482288999919616 2020-10-04 03:58:57 +0800 <SteveCass14> @SWso155 @susanstanwix None of these. The managerial elite class no longer even pretending to give a flying f*** about the bottom 50%
1312481553226760194 2020-10-04 03:56:01 +0800 <SteveCass14> Whichever is most convenient to that at the time, I suspect!
1312478300564975617 2020-10-04 03:43:06 +0800 <SteveCass14> @HolidayVinny @AshleyAFrawley @PornPanic Hmm. Hitler, Stalin,Mao. The State controlled the economy, media, education &amp; academia. It had a secret police force that could take you away &amp; murder or imprison at will. Concentration camps. State controlled movement of people &amp; speech. Genocide of out groups. Not so different.
1312476805501083653 2020-10-04 03:37:09 +0800 <SteveCass14> What a fantastic discussion. Thanks. It gives me great hope that people coming from a political viewpoint very different from mine can have so much in common with my way of thinking. 😀
1312459997360529408 2020-10-04 02:30:22 +0800 <SteveCass14> @AshleyAFrawley @PornPanic There's no difference between communisim &amp; fascism in terms of the way they manifest themselves &amp; control the population. The fact they may have differing academic/philosophical roots is irrelevant. How they operate in the real world is all that matters &amp; there's no difference.
1312458595754106880 2020-10-04 02:24:48 +0800 <SteveCass14> @AgainStan @Prisoner0071 @Pjreid10 yes &amp; yes. What it isn't, is as big a health danger as we are being told unless you are over 65 or have a serious exising medical condition.
1312457630082760705 2020-10-04 02:20:57 +0800 <SteveCass14> So the BBC have decided to sell biological women &amp; their hard-fought-for rights down the river to appease a tiny %age of the population who think that being born one biological sex but believing themselves to be the other, actually makes them so in reality? Lunacy!
1312426685262856192 2020-10-04 00:18:00 +0800 <SteveCass14> @HeatherEHeying @BretWeinstein Looking forward to it from the UK, Heather!
1312426270500761609 2020-10-04 00:16:21 +0800 <SteveCass14> @clanmacg That would be weird but I doubt it. I suspect she just either didn't think at all (an MP??) or decided that her needs were greater than the risk she was presenting other people with (an MP!).
1312415234318049281 2020-10-03 23:32:30 +0800 <SteveCass14> racist even?
1312414357410795527 2020-10-03 23:29:00 +0800 <SteveCass14> Other than defending female biological rights against trans activists, I tend to agree. Extremists of any kind are bad news for society.
1312355825537646592 2020-10-03 19:36:25 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣🤣
1312351599700905984 2020-10-03 19:19:38 +0800 <SteveCass14> Wow, Calvin. Such wise words in this article from you. Thank you!
1312350380433592320 2020-10-03 19:14:47 +0800 <SteveCass14> It's very sad what is happening to the UK and I suspect there's a lot of truth in this!
1312347180615823360 2020-10-03 19:02:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> @ParveenAtwal3 @heather_venter Good man!! 🤣
1312283972446150656 2020-10-03 14:50:54 +0800 <SteveCass14> @TimMadigan9 @catseyesjohnson It can mean whatever we want it to mean. That's the problem with these abstract terms.
1312283496363294725 2020-10-03 14:49:01 +0800 <SteveCass14> @christhemusic @Gee1Emm A combination of your parents and your education.
1312282990895157248 2020-10-03 14:47:00 +0800 <SteveCass14> Watch this short excerpt of an interview by Andrew Neil with Claire Fox.  https://t.co/4U4K1duiuO
1312281897305866240 2020-10-03 14:42:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> 'We should understand that institutions run by people who have group think at their core and only can see things in one particular way, has been incredibly destructive to trust in institutions, in democracy, and in people in authority'  https://t.co/4U4K1duiuO
1312083852895096840 2020-10-03 01:35:42 +0800 <SteveCass14> @noelplum That's it Noel. We've had liberal democracy for so long that the horrors of the first half of the 20th century are forgotten and ignored. The old saying of 'those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it'.
1312073135215214592 2020-10-03 00:53:07 +0800 <SteveCass14> @0_politics2 And don't forget how morally superior they are to you! 😉
1311742671053099009 2020-10-02 02:59:58 +0800 <SteveCass14> @OkBiology 11,000 is NOT a lot of people in countries with tens of millions of people. Always a small percentage of extremists/cranks in any large population.
1311739698973487109 2020-10-02 02:48:09 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Brian_Pocock21 There are various illnesses that affect ethnicities in different ways and to different degrees. We have to stop allowing people to make every issue about racism!

1311331092008443907 2020-09-30 23:44:30 +0800 <SteveCass14> You're being generous! 😃
1311328638009311234 2020-09-30 23:34:45 +0800 <SteveCass14> @HeatherEHeying @FreeRangeKids @meghan_daum @TheUnspeakPod Thanks Heather. And thanks for your regular conversations with Bret on you tube.
1311261569800691712 2020-09-30 19:08:14 +0800 <SteveCass14> @k_colonialism In the past Western paternalism was done from a viewpoint of cultural and intellectual superiority. Now it continues but from a combination of wanting to hold on to past influence we no longer have and guilt.
1311260672949444610 2020-09-30 19:04:41 +0800 <SteveCass14> For far too many academics their political ideology is what drives their theories and interpretations.
1311259137699909632 2020-09-30 18:58:35 +0800 <SteveCass14> @wemustleave1 True!
1311231035619848194 2020-09-30 17:06:55 +0800 <SteveCass14> Important correction!!
1311200157015379969 2020-09-30 15:04:13 +0800 <SteveCass14> I think so!
1311018351028826117 2020-09-30 03:01:47 +0800 <SteveCass14> @BenWinegard Depends what u mean by populism. It's one of those terms that can mean whatever you want. Going back to basics, why wouldn't you want to have policies that were 'popular' with the majority of the electorate? It's elitist to ram 'unpopular' ideas through against the majority view.
1311017110836064257 2020-09-30 02:56:51 +0800 <SteveCass14> @BenWinegard If the elites could be trusted to behave in the best interests of all and not just themselves, I would agree. But it's clear that we can't. The majority will accept elite leadershp as long as they feel respected (whether true or not). This is no longer the case.
1310976543343218689 2020-09-30 00:15:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> Exactly. Only ideologues decide their positions based purely on their political views.
1310975516510429186 2020-09-30 00:11:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> @noelplum 🤣🤣Nailed it as ever Noel!

1310612107528937473 2020-09-29 00:07:31 +0800 <SteveCass14> @ArchRose90 @chasfxb Agreed. And for more &amp; more, a choice that gains them very little while landing them in debt. Learn a trade, they rake it in!!
1310611443285458944 2020-09-29 00:04:52 +0800 <SteveCass14> @DeborahFSussex Presumably because it has nothing to do with us!!??
1310327732665016327 2020-09-28 05:17:30 +0800 <SteveCass14> They are liars trying to cover up their appalling views.
1310326981121265674 2020-09-28 05:14:31 +0800 <SteveCass14> @boblister_poole @delie67 Because 80% of students couldn't care less about the politics. So only the radical zealots stand and vote. Simples.
1310221298312806400 2020-09-27 22:14:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> @_Tomothyy_ It may be inconvenient but that's life. 😃
1310181705962192898 2020-09-27 19:37:15 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes. There is an empowering of minorities via the weaponising of victimhood. This is able to happen via wealthy &amp; influential majority folk feeling guilty &amp;/or morally superior in facilitating it. BUT their position means these people have nothing major to lose when it goes wrong
1310167592737406976 2020-09-27 18:41:10 +0800 <SteveCass14> @MediaGuido And also, they can be replaced by less left-wing indoctrinated people which will help the BBC achieve the political balance they have gradually shed in the last few decades.
1310167054855688193 2020-09-27 18:39:02 +0800 <SteveCass14> @emmamrevell @JuliaHB1 There's a vast social/community difference between helping small football clubs survive than bailing out a large company.
1310166001779179521 2020-09-27 18:34:51 +0800 <SteveCass14> My sentiments also at the moment. I can see both sides and am trying to work out which is most right. In the meantime, try to be reasonable with all folks.
1310164074920062978 2020-09-27 18:27:11 +0800 <SteveCass14> Fair enough. It's a perfectly reasonable view. 😀
1310135756715892736 2020-09-27 16:34:40 +0800 <SteveCass14> @corbymac @SocialM85897394 Right. But, the by-product is not incidental, particuarly for more introvert kids who only had a small group of friends in small towns or villages. It's not either/or, it's the combination of academic achievement &amp; learning to interact with a lot of different people.
1310118261833555968 2020-09-27 15:25:09 +0800 <SteveCass14> True. Most people only read/listen to sources of information that they know will agree with what they already think.
1310117585854267393 2020-09-27 15:22:27 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Meeksisglen @Sozzinski @BorisJohnson @pritipatel So this is wrong then?  https://t.co/QIRgduGabw
1310104615556395008 2020-09-27 14:30:55 +0800 <SteveCass14> Some certainly manage to give that impression!
1310103472835002369 2020-09-27 14:26:23 +0800 <SteveCass14> @HPluckrose At the moment, yes. The crazy Left have control of most culture, media and big companies, so this is a check. It may be a problem in the future of course.
1309938417661341698 2020-09-27 03:30:30 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Sozzinski Yes. It's the politically based hypocrisy which is unacceptable.
1309936351140294656 2020-09-27 03:22:18 +0800 <SteveCass14> @_Tomothyy_ I understand and don't really disagree. All I am saying is that when you feminise men by calling traditional male attitudes 'toxic', you can end up with beta males at the top who empathise more with the tiny trans minority than with protecting the biological female majority.
1309934333201874944 2020-09-27 03:14:17 +0800 <SteveCass14> Along with straight men who care more about women's rights than pretend women's rights! 😀
1309933924580237313 2020-09-27 03:12:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> @_Tomothyy_ Playing Devil's Advocate here: You blame men. However, it's the feminisation of society that has created (among other problems) this validation of what is a form of psychological illness. i.e. empathy over reality. What do you think?
1309932762237988866 2020-09-27 03:08:02 +0800 <SteveCass14> @DouglasKMurray @LBC Virtue-signalling hypocrisy?
1309927695422234625 2020-09-27 02:47:54 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Sozzinski @BorisJohnson @pritipatel I thought Sadiq Khan was in charge of the Mertropolitan Police?
1309907622930378752 2020-09-27 01:28:08 +0800 <SteveCass14> @realsb4feelings No, that would be a mistake. We need to change the mindset of those at the top, politicians and police.
1309906529160753153 2020-09-27 01:23:48 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Fox_Claire Yes. It's the one rule for some, another rule for others hypocrisy which is unacceptable.
1309817696503173120 2020-09-26 19:30:48 +0800 <SteveCass14> @FlavellG Sincere condolences but what a lovely thing to do in his memory!
1309815679009337345 2020-09-26 19:22:47 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Sozzinski @BBCNews There is an empowering of minorities (inc migrants) via the weaponising of victimhood. This is able to happen via wealthy &amp; influential majority folk feeling guilty &amp;/or morally superior in facilitating it. BUT these people have nothing major to lose if/when it goes wrong.
1309813446196764674 2020-09-26 19:13:55 +0800 <SteveCass14> Just goes to show how scared the hard-Left are of a news channel that may not always just follow the leftist elite take on every subject.
1309810867115110403 2020-09-26 19:03:40 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. Direct incitement to break the law, especially using aggression, should be prosecuted, not just be allowed to quietly leave.
1309809186092482561 2020-09-26 18:56:59 +0800 <SteveCass14> Brilliant!!!  https://t.co/DeadqhUvbT
1309754924109099009 2020-09-26 15:21:22 +0800 <SteveCass14> @TheRealAshParks Thanks for the correction. Did the interviewing journalist push back on such a crass comment though? I never understand why people care what celebrities think on socio-political matters. They don't live in the real world and know less than most ordinary folk who take an interest.
1309753214280097798 2020-09-26 15:14:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> @TheRealAshParks Ther are millions of situations which don't seem fair if you leave all the detail out!! FFS!! Context matters!! Does this person call themselves a journalist?? Propagandist more like!!
1309591472870580225 2020-09-26 04:31:52 +0800 <SteveCass14> A total lack of self-awareness
1309533691333533702 2020-09-26 00:42:16 +0800 <SteveCass14> Stupidity is being kind. Malicious or moronic would be better.
1309500549147103232 2020-09-25 22:30:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> Nah - the ends justify the means however damaging or hypocritical those means are!
1309499875407654915 2020-09-25 22:27:54 +0800 <SteveCass14> @VeteranGamerUK @wrongthinkQC @GeometricOrder @ADUK2019 @ConceptualJames There is an empowering of minorities (inc migrants) via the weaponising of victimhood.

1309497441864036354 2020-09-25 22:18:14 +0800 <SteveCass14> Sadly it's little more than a box ticking excercise these days.
1309496003997958144 2020-09-25 22:12:31 +0800 <SteveCass14> @KonstantinKisin That's not very left-wing of you Konstantin. 🤣
1309495088381341698 2020-09-25 22:08:52 +0800 <SteveCass14> Ideologues don't worry about unimportant things, like accuracy for example.
1309416514932670464 2020-09-25 16:56:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> @RejectIdeology I agree. I don't think Johnson has a clue where this is going to end up.
1309415743675674625 2020-09-25 16:53:35 +0800 <SteveCass14> @ellisgreg @RumbaRebel13 @LozzaFox Spot on assessment. It's about money!
1309414299648090112 2020-09-25 16:47:51 +0800 <SteveCass14> it goes wrong. Their comparative wealth/influence will allow them 2 safely remove themselves from the situation when the huge problems inevitably come. That's why the bottom 50% are taking any chance to stick 2 fingers up whenever they can. They realise that they're being shafted
1309414298209443840 2020-09-25 16:47:51 +0800 <SteveCass14> Here is the major problem: There is an empowering of (often small) minorities via the weaponising of victimhood. This is able to happen via wealthy &amp; influential majority folk feeling guilty &amp;/or morally superior in facilitating it. BUT these people have nothing major to lose if
1309410192258412544 2020-09-25 16:31:32 +0800 <SteveCass14> For those in the UK, by Liberalism he means hard left-wing politics.
1309409475963555843 2020-09-25 16:28:41 +0800 <SteveCass14> @RejectIdeology It wouldn't happen if the NUS leaders and the University leaders weren't of the same political persuasion. This is political ideologues sticking together.
1309214199223119877 2020-09-25 03:32:43 +0800 <SteveCass14> @PaulVanderKlay @timkellernyc @holland_tom Thanks for this Paul.
1309174737428512769 2020-09-25 00:55:55 +0800 <SteveCass14> @_Tomothyy_ I think the extremists think that by tearing everything down they ARE fighting for the betterment of themselves &amp; those they care about. That's the problem. They are utopian ideologues and the ends justify the means as far as they're concerned.
1309172920594436096 2020-09-25 00:48:42 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Arwenstar It's a reasonable viewpoint.
1309170702386421760 2020-09-25 00:39:53 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes, a lot of woke stuff is lies. However, some is exaggeration of a true problem and above all, they are driven by emotions and negative emotions at that.
1309142445817503747 2020-09-24 22:47:36 +0800 <SteveCass14> Interesting!
1309110816952799239 2020-09-24 20:41:55 +0800 <SteveCass14> @PaulEmbery So the answer is we need more extremists?? People who think that are dangerous.
1309109705948762117 2020-09-24 20:37:30 +0800 <SteveCass14> @KonstantinKisin Ah, but some have decided that they can gain even more by doing so!
1309109467674554369 2020-09-24 20:36:33 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Arwenstar True. Most Brits don't care about what happens in the USA, certainly on socio-political matters.
1309072024300670976 2020-09-24 18:07:46 +0800 <SteveCass14> @rakibehsan Perhaps they don't do this because they don't have much of a case? Not a rational one anyway.
1309063428120686592 2020-09-24 17:33:37 +0800 <SteveCass14> @_Tomothyy_ Well said!!
1309035367698440192 2020-09-24 15:42:07 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes. Hospitalisations and deaths are the important things.
1309033931090677766 2020-09-24 15:36:24 +0800 <SteveCass14> Thanks
1309032951682916358 2020-09-24 15:32:30 +0800 <SteveCass14> @MsCarolHScott @latimeralder @Majeh19 They aren't relevant on a CV - that's not the intention. The intention is for young people who may have only ever lived in one town with a small circle of friends to learn how to mix with new people as they'll likely have to once they start working and living in the adult world.
1309026135741788162 2020-09-24 15:05:25 +0800 <SteveCass14> @latimeralder @Majeh19 I agree. Basically, while this is going on, every university is the same as The Open University - which is very good but you don't get the social experiences which is a big part of university life.
1309022713382686721 2020-09-24 14:51:49 +0800 <SteveCass14> @_Tomothyy_ Or in other words the rational, scientifically truthful approach then. 😃This problem arose when medical people decided to affirm the delusions of people with mental health conditions instead of giving them the help &amp; treatment they needed.
1308842592839307264 2020-09-24 02:56:05 +0800 <SteveCass14> @AltNewsMedia She's an attention seeking anti-white troll. Ignore is the best policy.
1308838094280548357 2020-09-24 02:38:13 +0800 <SteveCass14> @_Tomothyy_ It can't be any other way when you decide that the way to deal with societal problems is not to remove prejudice but simply to reverse the flow of the prejudice.
1308835028659560449 2020-09-24 02:26:02 +0800 <SteveCass14> @MrSimonMount1 This woman is a university tenured anti-white troll. I just ignore her to be honest. Don't give her the attention she clearly craves.
1308833351810404355 2020-09-24 02:19:22 +0800 <SteveCass14> @_Tomothyy_ But of course we don't need to be either, do we?
1308776584690782209 2020-09-23 22:33:48 +0800 <SteveCass14> Anyone telling you with a straight face to read Judith Butler is not acting in good faith. Her original paper was no more than a series of unsubstantiated statements &amp; opinions.
1308775351598940160 2020-09-23 22:28:54 +0800 <SteveCass14> @dominiquetaegon Agreed. Abstract concepts cannot be pinned down which means they mean as much or as little as you want them to. Equality of outcome is impossible as we don't have equality of intelligence, drive, determination &amp; luck. We should try to increase equality of opportunity of course.
1308718932744953856 2020-09-23 18:44:43 +0800 <SteveCass14> @WinterfellT 'You can't force people to be community-minded. But....?????' That's exactly what authoritarian dictators say. When has it worked out well? Moral superiority excusing authoritarianism is bad. No-one gets to force you to behave how they want you to. Your life. Your choice.
1308715298242138112 2020-09-23 18:30:16 +0800 <SteveCass14> @rakibehsan Agreed. Not enough to have a moderate Starmer at the top with all the far Left people underneath.
1308680131121209345 2020-09-23 16:10:32 +0800 <SteveCass14> @NickBuckleyMBE Agreed. Abstract concepts cannot be pinned down which means they mean as much or as little as you want them to. As you say, equality of outcome is impossible as we don't have equality of intelligence, drive, determination &amp; luck. We should try to increase equality of opportunity.
1308660897213186048 2020-09-23 14:54:06 +0800 <SteveCass14> You need to get @PaulVanderKlay to discuss this with you.
1308660312351092736 2020-09-23 14:51:46 +0800 <SteveCass14> Silly, yes but also very dangerous!
1308660126040174593 2020-09-23 14:51:02 +0800 <SteveCass14> Because it's politically convenient possibly??
1308659868933468160 2020-09-23 14:50:01 +0800 <SteveCass14> @demi_lynne701 When you have had sufficient experiences of the good and bad to realise that life isn't simple or fair. I got to that point in my late 20s. It changed my socio-political views from dead certain to more open-minded and considerate of other's views.
1308320385197322240 2020-09-22 16:21:01 +0800 <SteveCass14> @rakibehsan Most country/non city folk are generally much more polite. I live in a market town with few black or asian people. But the few there are are not treated any differently to the majority. Why would they be? Racism is not everywhere &amp; where it exists is not confined to white folk!
1308309494129135617 2020-09-22 15:37:45 +0800 <SteveCass14> @zaelefty But the logic escapes them because emotions and power politics have consumed any vestige of reality left inside them.
1308309166214258688 2020-09-22 15:36:27 +0800 <SteveCass14> If you had half of Jordan Peterson's intelligence, you wouldn't post nonsense like this
1308139218363977728 2020-09-22 04:21:08 +0800 <SteveCass14> That's a reasonable way to look at it the way things stand at the moment.
1308070961820950528 2020-09-21 23:49:54 +0800 <SteveCass14> Spot on!
1308053631766323207 2020-09-21 22:41:02 +0800 <SteveCass14> That's an interesting combination of narcissism with condescension isn't it? 😒
1308027254061105152 2020-09-21 20:56:13 +0800 <SteveCass14> That's right. Whatever they do, 50% will complain. However, that should make the decision easier. Just do what your instinct tells you because for 50% of people, there's no right answer.
1307978449655660545 2020-09-21 17:42:18 +0800 <SteveCass14> Never understood what they stood for, other than the UK being subsumed into a European Super State. To have decided that full woke is the way to distinguish themselves from the other parties is a major error of judgement. 50% of members are soft Labour &amp; 50% are Green Party.
1307947893110833153 2020-09-21 15:40:52 +0800 <SteveCass14> Why aren't the care homes doing it I wonder?
1307947096813776901 2020-09-21 15:37:43 +0800 <SteveCass14> @DerSchwarzBaron @TRobertsNI Clearly it's a sign of BOTH
1307764908944240640 2020-09-21 03:33:46 +0800 <SteveCass14> What a surprise!!
1307676908033802240 2020-09-20 21:44:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> true but surely the answer is not to tweet as a knee-jerk response rather than put out a dodgy tweet and then ask people to be nice to you about it?
1307668962499592197 2020-09-20 21:12:30 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes. It's a rather middle class issue isn't it? Rather like most woke activists.
1307667867756883969 2020-09-20 21:08:09 +0800 <SteveCass14> @DouglasKMurray Is there a discount for those of us that bought the original version Douglas?
1307622577834209281 2020-09-20 18:08:11 +0800 <SteveCass14> @dominiquetaegon Using your media privilege to thrust your political views down the throats of others &amp; then claim victimhood (racism/misogyny) when people call you out is hypocritical. The viewers were the victims of her political propaganda. That said, rudeness/threats to her are not necessary.
1307620856194097152 2020-09-20 18:01:21 +0800 <SteveCass14> @MrSimonMount1 And I bet you were simply the best there!😀
1307620684311527424 2020-09-20 18:00:40 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. Trying to make complex multi-dimensional issues sound simple by putting forward a mono-dimensional solution is not only unhelpful but likely to make things worse rather than better overall.
1307620029773631494 2020-09-20 17:58:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> @alien_spike @WeDoNotLearn73 Apologies. I was assuming that came within my possible reasons! 😀
1307587952155951105 2020-09-20 15:50:36 +0800 <SteveCass14> @andrewdoyle_com I agree that on traditional definitions they are not Left but it can't be just co-incidence that all woke folk would vote for Left-wing parties??
1307587336218324994 2020-09-20 15:48:09 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes. Because, didn't you know, 'woke; is the new religion and religous righteousness cloaks you from all evil, including airborne disease. (NB also from hypocrisy, authoritarianism etc).
1307584811024908288 2020-09-20 15:38:07 +0800 <SteveCass14> @KarenH777 It's certainly not a good look!
1307584288381169676 2020-09-20 15:36:02 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣🤣
1307573657166917632 2020-09-20 14:53:48 +0800 <SteveCass14> aarrghh!! Too late!! 🤣🤣
1307573350370349056 2020-09-20 14:52:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes. This level of closed-minded ideologically possessed hatred &amp; narcissism is hard to beat.
1307571727648645120 2020-09-20 14:46:08 +0800 <SteveCass14> Whoa! Stop there. I'm a Brit, so if we're going to start comparing word spellings, we'll get hopelessly tangled! 🤣
1307568091065454593 2020-09-20 14:31:41 +0800 <SteveCass14> I would say that great minds think alike, except that I can't claim to have a great mind! 😀
1307566253742190593 2020-09-20 14:24:22 +0800 <SteveCass14> @WeDoNotLearn73 Certainly you can't excuse mass BLM protests &amp; then complain about the health risks of a protest you don't like politically. That sort of hypocrisy just makes you look ridiculous or a bad faith actor.
1307565550902685696 2020-09-20 14:21:35 +0800 <SteveCass14> @CathyYoung63 Well, that's true of course but as 'woke' views clearly existed already, I think the burden of proof (as opposed to opinion) is surely on your side. You seem to be suggesting that without Trump, what, 'woke' would have just gone away naturally? Wishful thinking I believe.
1307563380358680576 2020-09-20 14:12:57 +0800 <SteveCass14> @EileenTurner8 Certainly the written press is usually more evenly balanced but the TV press in the UK is entirely anti this Government.
1307562900257746945 2020-09-20 14:11:03 +0800 <SteveCass14> The TRAs are deniers of basic biology. I feel sorry 4 them as they obviously have mental health issues that make their lives uncomfortable but stomping on the rights of biological women can't be the answer. The majority of men stand with the majority of biological women on this.
1307560920357494784 2020-09-20 14:03:11 +0800 <SteveCass14> They've calculated that it will damage the current Government. Simple as that  I suspect.
1307560319884185600 2020-09-20 14:00:48 +0800 <SteveCass14> Hmm. You accept that many woke attitudes already existed. The allowing of these attitudes to take hold at their creation was the problem. They would have gotten worse anyway, maybe more slowly, but Trump didn't create wokeness &amp; caving-in to woke bullies is an individual decision
1307400577207410689 2020-09-20 03:26:02 +0800 <SteveCass14> @_Tomothyy_ The Cure
1307394469495439360 2020-09-20 03:01:46 +0800 <SteveCass14> @RejectIdeology Not sure most celebs have heard of Faust! 🤣
1307367809870110722 2020-09-20 01:15:50 +0800 <SteveCass14> @ChrisJC12002 Not over about 13 years of age, no!
1307361058139463680 2020-09-20 00:49:00 +0800 <SteveCass14> @jonnyross05 Hundreds of £thousands in many case and in some, over a £million!!!
1307359128013221890 2020-09-20 00:41:20 +0800 <SteveCass14> It's such obvious nonsense but the Lib Dems have gradually lost the plot ever since Ashdown's leadership.
1307352754604703750 2020-09-20 00:16:00 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes. Sorry, I did realise that. Should have put a smiley emoji. 😀
1307352537016807432 2020-09-20 00:15:08 +0800 <SteveCass14> @RejectIdeology Perhaps we (ignored majority) need a) to be a bit braver or we'll continue to get trampled on &amp; b) care a bit less about what those running society trumpet as necessary to 'get on'. But it has to start with decidng 4 yourself not waiting 4 a wealthy celeb 2 tell you what 2 think.
1307350966316957696 2020-09-20 00:08:54 +0800 <SteveCass14> Well, certainly not approved of by the wokesters who seem to be pulling the strings of those with power &amp; influlence in our society. If they gain true power, maybe these things will indeed be made illegal.
1307350396306952195 2020-09-20 00:06:38 +0800 <SteveCass14> @RejectIdeology Agreed. He (and all other public facing visual media employees) say the things they know they need to to keep their jobs &amp; pay. My issue is that individual 'ordinary' members of the public don't have to take any notice. We must do our own thinking &amp; ignore the establishment view.
1307347468036837379 2020-09-19 23:55:00 +0800 <SteveCass14> @RejectIdeology It's pretty pathetic in my view 2 conform 2 allow people who've been successful in a particular field 2 tell you what is right &amp; wrong. So someone's a great actor or sports star - why does that mean their views on society &amp; politics are worthy of more attention than anyone elses?
1307299640803553281 2020-09-19 20:44:57 +0800 <SteveCass14> @RejectIdeology People with the amount of profile &amp; money as Lineker shouldn't tell others what to do and think. It's utterly arrogant. At the end of the day, he's a footballer who's got lucky. Who cares what he thinks? I'll think for myself thanks. Why does anyone care what celebrities think?
1307297947789426688 2020-09-19 20:38:13 +0800 <SteveCass14> @PaulJon27273238 As soon as the BLM movement used people like Floyd &amp; Blake to be the symbols of their movement it was obviously about power politcs and not racism.
1307014781644288000 2020-09-19 01:53:01 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Raynerc113 What's an alternative that's not worse?
1306962152041918464 2020-09-18 22:23:53 +0800 <SteveCass14> Absolutely a Ponzi scheme. It was set up on that basis because back then, most men didn't live more than 10 years beyond retirement &amp; so there were far fewer pensioners &amp; living noticeably less long. With increased longevity &amp; declining birth rates, it's unsustainable long-term.
1306901406146846720 2020-09-18 18:22:30 +0800 <SteveCass14> WTF???!!!
1306656267268653056 2020-09-18 02:08:25 +0800 <SteveCass14> @RumbaRebel13 @MrSimonMount1 True. remember when Arlene Phillips was booted off Strictly?
1306598572515684353 2020-09-17 22:19:09 +0800 <SteveCass14> @ayrshire_boy That was the Remain argument against Brexit wasn't it?
1306551956048154625 2020-09-17 19:13:55 +0800 <SteveCass14> @robertwlk @dontcha_know1 @AmandaTopsy66 Not the Queen, I'm sure!
1306550934160502784 2020-09-17 19:09:51 +0800 <SteveCass14> @estherk_k But they so want it to. On the face of it, (i.e. without thinking about &amp; with zero knowledge of history), it seems so great. Everyone's equal &amp; everyone's happy! Sadly, that's not how our species evolved &amp; so it simply doesn't work in practice, even when brute force is used.
1306547578327138304 2020-09-17 18:56:31 +0800 <SteveCass14> I suspect you're both right. Strong &amp; smart will rule after the zombie apocalypse! 😀
1306530627743895559 2020-09-17 17:49:10 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Iainmackay8 @Jem2355 Hmm.... they've got socialism as well, I think!

1306506598857224192 2020-09-17 16:13:41 +0800 <SteveCass14> @RejectIdeology @MarcherLord1 While in essence I agree, we must remember that viruses spread faster and more easily among high population densities. England has a much higher populaiton density than Sweden. I still think herd immunity was the way to go but that was not the advice from the Gov's chosen boffins
1306505919765917698 2020-09-17 16:10:59 +0800 <SteveCass14> @KoolKat1025 They're certainly leaving themselves wide open to that interpretation.
1306492851308683264 2020-09-17 15:19:03 +0800 <SteveCass14> 🤣🤣🤣
1306490566335778817 2020-09-17 15:09:59 +0800 <SteveCass14> @_HelenDale 🤣
1306487769129250817 2020-09-17 14:58:52 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Upyourjunker1 Or indeed why any employee of the BBC is worth more than £100,000pa?
1306486940104110080 2020-09-17 14:55:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. Facts are only appropriate when they confirm the correct narrative!
1306485387884482563 2020-09-17 14:49:24 +0800 <SteveCass14> @uk_sf_writer @BBCNews Also, we are testing more people per day than most if not all other European countries.
1306483522702639104 2020-09-17 14:41:59 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. Also, it isn't a very intelligent way of thinking is it. since what you say should be obvious.
1306322847753736194 2020-09-17 04:03:31 +0800 <SteveCass14> My view: There is no job in the BBC so difficult or important that anyone should need to be paid more than £100,000pa. If the higher earners don't like it, they can go elsewhere but there are only so many jobs out there, so they might want to consider carefully before doing so.
1306319650335141891 2020-09-17 03:50:49 +0800 <SteveCass14> The answer of course is to pay all these people a lot less, not use past excessive salaries as an excuse to pay some people more now.
1306318603009101825 2020-09-17 03:46:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. They know no more, and often less, about a subject that non-celebs
1306191795311841280 2020-09-16 19:22:46 +0800 <SteveCass14> @roderickgraham A reasonable person would assume they HAD researched it or at least asked them the question before posting a negative comment.
1306140591689019392 2020-09-16 15:59:18 +0800 <SteveCass14> @confidencenac Agree.
1306127061178814465 2020-09-16 15:05:32 +0800 <SteveCass14> Of course but it doesn't help the SJW activist cause so they blatantly and with no shame try to claim otherwise!
1305955353444724736 2020-09-16 03:43:14 +0800 <SteveCass14> @MrSimonMount1 You seem to be suggesting that context matters. Weird!! 😉😀

Both sides take offence, often as a tactic rather than reality. Transwomen are a very tiny minority yet they want to impinge on biological women's rights in sports,safe spaces etc. It's perfectly reasonable not to agree with that
1305896357627072512 2020-09-15 23:48:48 +0800 <SteveCass14> It wouldn't matter if they were at the top of their game. None of them do a job difficult or important enough to be paid anthing near these amounts of money! Certainly not from compulsory taxation!
1305895231406120961 2020-09-15 23:44:20 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Shatterface @KushPrinc3 @SpeechUnion Yes. When people claim that no attempt to silence JKR has been made, they make themselves look very foolish or are just posting in bad faith.

1305865751866339330 2020-09-15 21:47:11 +0800 <SteveCass14> @TheRealAshParks Not sure JKR thinks she has a 'cause', Ash. Being honest when confronted with what you believe to be falsehoods about a given situation, just means you're honest &amp; have courage. As I said, her wealth makes it easier for her to say what she likes of course I accept that😁
1305865028709605379 2020-09-15 21:44:19 +0800 <SteveCass14> I mostly agree. We need to remember that Sweden has a vastly lower poulation density to England but still, unless we get a genuine second wave of hospitalisations &amp; deaths, Sweden seem to have got it right.
1305864046755958786 2020-09-15 21:40:25 +0800 <SteveCass14> My view: There is no job in the BBC so difficult or important that anyone should need to be paid more than £100,000pa. If the higher earners don't like it, they can go elsewhere but there are only so many jobs out there, so they might want to consider carefully before doing so.
1305863978971787264 2020-09-15 21:40:09 +0800 <SteveCass14> @TheVietGwent Agreed. Funded by a compulsory tax, it's totally unacceptable!
1305863715707908097 2020-09-15 21:39:06 +0800 <SteveCass14> @PippaP22 The ideologically possessed don't think rationally though! 😁
1305863213976780802 2020-09-15 21:37:06 +0800 <SteveCass14> @TheRealAshParks Understand your point but self-censorship is what you're advocating for JKR. When we self-censor, we're doing the bullies' job for them. Fortunately, JKR is wealthy enough to ignore them.
1305862774912937990 2020-09-15 21:35:21 +0800 <SteveCass14> Correct. They will have to see the downside of leaving the UK clearly &amp; then make a decision. NB The EU won't want yet another financial drain on their now reduced coffers, which Scotland would be. As at 2018 excl the UK, there are 9 net giving countries &amp; 18 net taking. Oh dear!
1305860528875753472 2020-09-15 21:26:26 +0800 <SteveCass14> My view: There is no job in the BBC so difficult or important that anyone should need to be paid more than £100,000pa.

1305839642877612032 2020-09-15 20:03:26 +0800 <SteveCass14> @SpeechUnion 1. Taking offence is a choice; 2. not agreeing with you is not de facto wrong, let alone offensive; 3. those who claim to be offended or hurt by differing opinions usually do so in an attempt to silence critics &amp; because it's much easier than having to cogently argue your case.
1305834375452524545 2020-09-15 19:42:30 +0800 <SteveCass14> My view: There is no job in the BBC so difficult or important that anyone should need to be paid more than £100,000pa.

1305831181682913280 2020-09-15 19:29:49 +0800 <SteveCass14> True of those pulling the strings. Not sure most of the ordinary supporters have given it that much thought, which may be the problem.
1305828021774016512 2020-09-15 19:17:16 +0800 <SteveCass14> @HPluckrose How very reactionary of you, Helen! 😉😁
1305824096454881285 2020-09-15 19:01:40 +0800 <SteveCass14> @LONGPIG68 @tomhfh I agree. If the Scots look at the situation in the round and decide that they'll be better off all things considered being independent, I have no issue with that at all.
1305803373208383488 2020-09-15 17:39:19 +0800 <SteveCass14> @LONGPIG68 @tomhfh The majority of English don't mind if Scotland goes independent anymore. Perhaps it's time for all nations to realise that larger pseudo-democratic conglomerations of countries with differing cultures, languages and economic needs don't work (other than for those in the top 50%).
1305801801472581632 2020-09-15 17:33:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> @AdamJCallison @tomhfh It works just as an insurance policy, Adam. You hope not to need it but it's there as a last resort if the EU try and divide Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK via tariffs. I'm not asking you to like it or agree, but that's the answer to your question.
1305801237636542465 2020-09-15 17:30:50 +0800 <SteveCass14> Indeed. You hope not to need your seatbelt but will be bloody glad if you do 😀
1305800705161256960 2020-09-15 17:28:43 +0800 <SteveCass14> @tomhfh The best thing this government could do now is to stop taking any notice of what the media (mainstream or social) says and just do what they know the majority who voted for them will agree with. Sort of the point of democracy isn't it?
1305800269716951040 2020-09-15 17:26:59 +0800 <SteveCass14> Agreed. It looks to many that the EU wanted to punish the UK for ruining their grand plan and used the pro-remain majority in Parliament (until December) to waste time in the hope that something would happen to stop Brexit. Of course this creates mistrust in the EU from Brexiters
1305792757504471040 2020-09-15 16:57:08 +0800 <SteveCass14> @MaureenDalby I wouldn't mind so much if I thought his knowledge on these issues was anything other than superficial. If he was interviewed by a proper interviewer, eg Andrew Neil or Jeremy Paxman, his lack of depth would become immediately apparent.
1305791319504191489 2020-09-15 16:51:25 +0800 <SteveCass14> They weren't rogue so much as ardent Remainers. They thought they were doing what was best for the UK since being part of a European super-state is what's best in their view - the best for whom though is the question.
1305790444039745537 2020-09-15 16:47:56 +0800 <SteveCass14> And don't forget his Private Finance Initiatives that have cost an arm and a leg as well!!
1305769140570001413 2020-09-15 15:23:17 +0800 <SteveCass14> So many social issues don't get discussed or dealt with properly because people want to be viewed as 'nice', 'kind' 'inclusive' etc. It makes serious honest good faith debate on vital topics almost impossible if you care more about your public image than getting to the truth.
1305768172411408384 2020-09-15 15:19:26 +0800 <SteveCass14> Correct. And their comparative wealth &amp; influence means that when their social engineering goes wrong, they'll be alright. Beware those with no meaningful skin in the game deciding what's best for others. You're much more likely to take high risks when you'll be ok if it goes bad
1305767276344422400 2020-09-15 15:15:53 +0800 <SteveCass14> @_Tomothyy_ You require self-awareness to realise you're an asshole thought, right? 😀
1305765430674501632 2020-09-15 15:08:33 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Ianblackford_MP Just behaving in the way you believe you do, Mr Blackford. Putting the best interests of their small country ahead of what's best for the larger entity they are part of.
1305758574111592448 2020-09-15 14:41:18 +0800 <SteveCass14> @RejectIdeology Sadly not just politicians. There is an elite class of politicians, academics, media, legal profession, educators, pop culture &amp; corporate directors who think like this. Majority opinion is irrelevant when the minority have all the power &amp; influence. I sound like a socialist 😒
1305445743474466816 2020-09-14 17:58:13 +0800 <SteveCass14> @K_Niemietz 😂
1305444693208043521 2020-09-14 17:54:03 +0800 <SteveCass14> I think that's a reasonable argument.
1305186907085824000 2020-09-14 00:49:42 +0800 <SteveCass14> @fragrantfeline @mitsyarty The young are often single-minded, very arrogant and based on very little knowledge. I was!
1305186084440150026 2020-09-14 00:46:26 +0800 <SteveCass14> @macinnes_phil @WinterfellT From a low base &amp; short-lived. The 1970s were a nightmare which is how Thatcher got in. Weak governnments, 3 day weeks, huge union unrest, regular power cuts, oil crises, high inflation, high unemployment, needing to be bailed out by the IMF, rubbish uncollected, dead unburiedetc
1305092315040669696 2020-09-13 18:33:50 +0800 <SteveCass14> @WinterfellT Of course we need a good relationship. But like in any divorce, the partner leaving can only have a good relationsiop if the partner being left is prepapred to be reasonable rather than wanting revenge.
1305090884078272513 2020-09-13 18:28:08 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Stayathomemum6 As you know well, it's not HER views it's YOUR views. What a pathetic bit of parenting!
1305090194463510536 2020-09-13 18:25:24 +0800 <SteveCass14> @KingBobIIV @ShaunBaileyUK Hope you're wrong!
1305089913507975172 2020-09-13 18:24:17 +0800 <SteveCass14> @WinterfellT We joined the EEC as our economy was shot &amp; enough people saw it as way 'out' of that problem, not because we wanted to be part of a European Super State. De Gaulle was right. Our legal sytem &amp; culture are quite different and would never work long term without total capitulation.
1305083570390798336 2020-09-13 17:59:05 +0800 <SteveCass14> @GiftCee @acgrayling Is see it like this. I am a Somerset lad. So in Cricket, I want Somerset to win. BUT I put my Country ahead of my County in politics.. One Worlders think of their Country like a County. They want us to win at sports but the utopian pan-European State is put first in politics.
1305044643843842048 2020-09-13 15:24:24 +0800 <SteveCass14> It doesn't seem to bother various other countries. China for example that those on the Left refuse to condemn for it's ethnic cleansing of Uyghurs and other human rights abuses.
1305042242701340673 2020-09-13 15:14:51 +0800 <SteveCass14> @RejectIdeology Agreed. It is a display of contempt by the powerful for the truth.
1305041928132669440 2020-09-13 15:13:36 +0800 <SteveCass14> @DavidEspley @MaajidNawaz @SadiqKhan @UKLabour @realDonaldTrump @CityHallLabour @UyghurCongress It's not a phobia to state the truth.China is ethnic cleansing Uyghurs. De-twinning would have been a symbolic gesture to show Labour's disapproval. Not to do so allows the opposite interpretation. A choice to support the oppressor not the victim. Not very progressive was it?
1305037471068102656 2020-09-13 14:55:54 +0800 <SteveCass14> @JohnScotting It's unbelievable isn't it? He has to be mentally unhinged to make public statements like that doesn't he? He could say it without the anger and insults - bizarre!!
1304805569207971842 2020-09-12 23:34:24 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Miss_Snuffy You're not suggesting that there's black privilege on display here? 😉
1304805152541507586 2020-09-12 23:32:45 +0800 <SteveCass14> @cube1729 @thatginamiller @ProfMarkElliott What's more important, living in a self-governing democracy or being a subservient region of a pseudo-democratic pan-European super-state? That's what Remainers don't get. For most Brexiteers I know, it was about nation state democracy not the economy. Soyou're talking past them.
1304803462224453633 2020-09-12 23:26:02 +0800 <SteveCass14> @MrSimonMount1 Of course. Cat just thought you were playing a fun hunting game with it. 😀

1304740021220540416 2020-09-12 19:13:56 +0800 <SteveCass14> @GiftCee @guyverhofstadt @NicolaSturgeon Yes. It's an elitist dictatorship in democratic clothing.
1304739705162997765 2020-09-12 19:12:41 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Arwenstar A realist/pragmastist after my own heart. As you say, the huffing &amp; puffing achieves nothing apart perhaps from making us feel better for a few minutes. 😃
1304661253508468736 2020-09-12 14:00:56 +0800 <SteveCass14> @EricRWeinstein Agreed but how to do that when the leaders don't appear to know (or care?) what's best for their people?
1304660320011649025 2020-09-12 13:57:14 +0800 <SteveCass14> @WinterfellT Don't despair - we must keep fighting for this! 😃
1304659980239417345 2020-09-12 13:55:53 +0800 <SteveCass14> @FreedomCitizen1 If solid, probably. If plastic, probably not! 😃
1304657829098336256 2020-09-12 13:47:20 +0800 <SteveCass14> @peytonjim @matthew54063058 Clearly not about George Floyd in the UK. Any comparisons to race relations in the USA or with policing etc are weak. The fact that some care more about the death of a criminal in USA than of non-criminals in their own country shows that a political power grab is what it's about
1304656649391616000 2020-09-12 13:42:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> @dominiquetaegon Fortunately, your both intelligent and strong enough to ignore these a-holes!
1304655363069956101 2020-09-12 13:37:32 +0800 <SteveCass14> Exactly. What person A would describe as you being kind/nice may not look like that to person B. Also, being nice may be OK or prevent confrontation short-term but in the longer run was actually not the best response. We see this all the time in politics. Emotion v pragmatism?
1304653241255432193 2020-09-12 13:29:06 +0800 <SteveCass14> @zaelefty But if the way person A defines their respect &amp; dignity directly impinges on the rights of, or way person B defines THEIR respect &amp; dignity, you get conflict. Trans v gay/lesbian v women's rights being an obvious example. This idea of be nice at all times doesn't work in reality.
1304475581887676417 2020-09-12 01:43:09 +0800 <SteveCass14> @_Tomothyy_ Fully agree. Those who suggest the way to fight racism is with reverse racism; bigotry with reverse bigotry; misogyny with misandry etc. That's revenge/hatred.
1304458406963613697 2020-09-12 00:34:54 +0800 <SteveCass14> @JaneEli43770173 She clearly believes making racist comments will help defeat racism. Hmm........
1304327772660207616 2020-09-11 15:55:48 +0800 <SteveCass14> What wokeness has done or what some people have allowed wokeness to do?? Wokeness is a choice - a bad and sad one admittedly, but a choice.
1304326625853669377 2020-09-11 15:51:15 +0800 <SteveCass14> @RejectIdeology Like the analogy 😃
1304151453066563584 2020-09-11 04:15:11 +0800 <SteveCass14> @engcathedrals @Baroness_Nichol Thanks for the memories. I was at school there.
1304134639490039818 2020-09-11 03:08:22 +0800 <SteveCass14> @ShaunBaileyUK @atticrahman @LondonLabour Why surprised at Labour and Greens behaviour over China? Communists stick together!
1304127970064334849 2020-09-11 02:41:52 +0800 <SteveCass14> @JoyceCarolOates What an utterly fatuous comment.
1304055879722041345 2020-09-10 21:55:24 +0800 <SteveCass14> @andreinawie @RumbaRebel13 certainly tempting!
1304054628691193856 2020-09-10 21:50:26 +0800 <SteveCass14> @ThomasSowell So perhaps they aren't as intelligent(sia) as they think!
1303947600488529921 2020-09-10 14:45:08 +0800 <SteveCass14> @que_uk Are you white? If so, you are racist. End of. All other facts or considerations are irrelevant. Keeping the cult rules so simple makes them easier to follow.
1303945706831577088 2020-09-10 14:37:37 +0800 <SteveCass14> Yes. It's not a tricky concept to understand either is it?
1303944263328292865 2020-09-10 14:31:53 +0800 <SteveCass14> What the actual F***??!! People who think like this are mentally ill and a danger to children.

1303583129282715649 2020-09-09 14:36:52 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Real_Adam_B @markoftheD Good answer to a blatantly loaded question.
1303579903657418752 2020-09-09 14:24:03 +0800 <SteveCass14> @EPoe187 Theory:This will never stop because it is the physical strength superiority which is the issue. Women know that, because men are on average much stronger, men can take control via violence whenever they choose. This scares and angers them. Hence the constant misandry by rad fems.
1303414328582864896 2020-09-09 03:26:06 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Sapere_vivere The irony appears to be lost on them.
1303383589904670721 2020-09-09 01:23:58 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Muttmere1 It's not supposed to make sense. It's about seeing how many people they can dupe/scare into agreeing with them - the detail is irrelevant.
1303361446160617473 2020-09-08 23:55:58 +0800 <SteveCass14> @ghost_wales It's about those who live mainly via their emotions.

Irrespective of whose fault the lack of one parent is, it's better for children to have 2. All studies confirm this. But this simple truth meets with hostility &amp; unfounded cries of misogyny.

1303266403236147201 2020-09-08 17:38:18 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Ash_Hirani @LozzaFox But all such things DO become the new normal because modern society cares more about not hurting the feelings of any kind of minority (eg single parents) than telling the simple truth.

1302551154749042688 2020-09-06 18:16:10 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Lava_Louisa Legal?? How is it moral????!!!! It never ceases to amaze me how immorally those who claim moral supreriority are happy to behave. A political agenda hiding behind a veneer of morality.
1302549538046083073 2020-09-06 18:09:44 +0800 <SteveCass14> @_Tomothyy_ Agreed!!
1302548825308114944 2020-09-06 18:06:54 +0800 <SteveCass14> @whitlockjason is an American Sports journalist. He is a rare voice of sanity. Take a look at this, particlualry from about 6 minutes onwards.  https://t.co/isyTB7O0TR
1302510395039584256 2020-09-06 15:34:12 +0800 <SteveCass14> @TomMcTague Agreed Tom. Not sure on what track record senior civil servanst should be trusted to judge the effectiveness of others anyway. They're so cocooned from real life in the Civil Service, I'd be wary of their judgement on most things/people.
1302509000358088704 2020-09-06 15:28:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> @HPluckrose Fair enough, Helen. That's not how it came over to me, I'm sorry. I'm CofE and the CofE hasn't talked about 'going to Hell' for decades. 😀
1302498576539545600 2020-09-06 14:47:14 +0800 <SteveCass14> @AlessandraAster OUCH!! As a straight man I'd like to disagree but I can't. The fact that most of the upset seems to be about transwomen and most of the aggressive TRAs seem to be transwomen not transmen, makes it difficult to argue with you, so I won't!
1302497222966358016 2020-09-06 14:41:51 +0800 <SteveCass14> @LTHlondon @Goldielocks1960 @DawnButlerBrent These are the problems you get when you pick candidates for MPs other than on genuine merit.
1302496471686750208 2020-09-06 14:38:52 +0800 <SteveCass14> @HPluckrose Yes but this isn't the case Helen (certainly not in the UK) &amp; isn't going to be, so I'm not sure the point of your post. CRT IS becoming like (bad) Christianity (ie coerced) &amp; as such is certainly worse. You can't hate Christianity so much that you liken the secular CofE to CRT?
1302295721484353544 2020-09-06 01:21:10 +0800 <SteveCass14> @estherk_k Yes but on average, the desire is less visceral than in women probably.
1302274771464454146 2020-09-05 23:57:55 +0800 <SteveCass14> @andrewdoyle_com They may as well say 'expertise on being human'. No-one is an expert or we all are. Now if they mean indoctrinated with extreme views on ethnicity etc then OK, but that's not expertise, it's ideological possession.
1302260186460061696 2020-09-05 22:59:57 +0800 <SteveCass14> @christianjbdev U have 2 judge each situation on it's own merits surely. If he's right about critical race theory, other things he may be wrong about are irrelevant. Any other view sets you down the road of always agreeing/disagreeing based on one particular view they have that you like or don't
1302208541579718657 2020-09-05 19:34:44 +0800 <SteveCass14> @christianjbdev doesn't mean he isn't right on Critical race Theory though does it?
1302188213071745025 2020-09-05 18:13:58 +0800 <SteveCass14> @ZacGoldsmith @TheSun They're just out to destroy society. They couldn't give a monkeys about the details.
1302187485909397504 2020-09-05 18:11:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> @CamillaTominey @DawnButlerBrent They're just out to destroy society. They couldn't give a monkeys about the details.
1302121355475910657 2020-09-05 13:48:18 +0800 <SteveCass14> @TheRealAshParks yeah but it's not mainly about race is it?. Life isn't fair in many ways, health, beauty, intelligence, drive, determination, and just plain luck (good &amp; bad) for example. Being told you're a victim from a young age will end in tears, either for you, someone else, or both!
1302120244790599680 2020-09-05 13:43:53 +0800 <SteveCass14> @TheRealAshParks Of course. Not to mention all the black athletes in the NBA/NFL etc paid more money than most folk, whatever their ancestry, in the USA can ever dream of!
1301969127402360835 2020-09-05 03:43:24 +0800 <SteveCass14> @PrefabTrout i'm 55 - me neither!
1301900991948820481 2020-09-04 23:12:39 +0800 <SteveCass14> @RejectIdeology It should be laughable but it's become too close to reality recently hasn't it?
1301899853816094720 2020-09-04 23:08:07 +0800 <SteveCass14> @RejectIdeology Just goes to show the gradual takeover of the metroplitan university elite socialists who care very little for the bottom 20% of our society.
1301899357168508928 2020-09-04 23:06:09 +0800 <SteveCass14> @rakibehsan Agreed. Whether I agree with the examples or not, they ARE legitimate views.
1301782579083911168 2020-09-04 15:22:07 +0800 <SteveCass14> @AlStewartOBE We'll see Alistair. Actions speak louder than words.
1301778990462636032 2020-09-04 15:07:51 +0800 <SteveCass14> @EPoe187 I had a realisation at about age 27 that some of the things I was utterly certain about at 17,18,19 were in fact, if not totally wrong, in need of far more nuanced thinking.
1301604394467840000 2020-09-04 03:34:04 +0800 <SteveCass14> @nickolasdreyfus Yes. Don't get people wearing masks alone in cars or frankly when outside at all.
1301603145500495874 2020-09-04 03:29:07 +0800 <SteveCass14> @tomhfh @lucycthomas @SkyNews So @lucycthomas is happy to go on national tv and either do no research or blatanty lie? This is ideological arrogance for you.
1301568449186062336 2020-09-04 01:11:14 +0800 <SteveCass14> @TitaniaMcGrath 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1301567811731566592 2020-09-04 01:08:42 +0800 <SteveCass14> @JulieBorowski YES!!!!
1301527402246541314 2020-09-03 22:28:08 +0800 <SteveCass14> @BenWinegard @DouglasKMurray is this. He calls himself a secular christian, meaning an atheist/agnostic who values &amp; wants to keep our christian heritage.
1301460894870896641 2020-09-03 18:03:51 +0800 <SteveCass14> @andrewdoyle_com @TitaniaMcGrath When purchased, read it to your kids and laugh mockingly. It seems too many youngsters don't get why this stuff is not correct these days!
1301459816116822017 2020-09-03 17:59:34 +0800 <SteveCass14> @KonstantinKisin And way over their heads the irony will sail! 😂
1301459616920940544 2020-09-03 17:58:47 +0800 <SteveCass14> @rakibehsan Of course. We all know the race issue is just a facade to hide their far-Left politics behind.
1301458786536873987 2020-09-03 17:55:29 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Jamessteel2008 @KonstantinKisin @BBC What a nasty piece of work you are!
1301458294788239365 2020-09-03 17:53:32 +0800 <SteveCass14> @JohnScotting The assumed moral superiority of the wealthy Left works like a religious cult. They neither see nor care about their hypocrisies and self-serving behaviour.
1301178161414234113 2020-09-02 23:20:23 +0800 <SteveCass14> @antihero_kate These wealthy politicians that promote division for political ends know that they can use their wealth &amp; position to just get out if the going gets too tough. Nost can't. Grr.....😢
1301133341543071744 2020-09-02 20:22:17 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Jen4Scot Shut down social media? Enforce freedom of speech, expression &amp; viewpoint in our education system &amp; particularly, Universities.
1301132051370913796 2020-09-02 20:17:09 +0800 <SteveCass14> @Doc_Pozzi very good! 🤣
1301129906970034183 2020-09-02 20:08:38 +0800 <SteveCass14> @GiftCee @piersmorgan Agreed. What has Sunak done other than what he (politically) had little choice but to do?
1300861855406194688 2020-09-02 02:23:29 +0800 <SteveCass14> @richard_bishop1 I agree. I don't see how anyone who remembers the last 5 years of the 1970s can think Thatcher was worse than that!
1300859271610073089 2020-09-02 02:13:13 +0800 <SteveCass14> @0_politics2 I think they just hate this country.
1300786716383621125 2020-09-01 21:24:55 +0800 <SteveCass14> @jonkay FFS! Most of these people need psychiatric help not having their delusions affirmed.
1300783157906681857 2020-09-01 21:10:46 +0800 <SteveCass14> @YardleyShooting @BBC Because you're stupid and they are the wise intelligent overlords who know what's best for you. Come on, keep up! 🤣
1300782512407543808 2020-09-01 21:08:12 +0800 <SteveCass14> @guardian Not really. Many people been made unnecessarily scared &amp; fragile by the muddled &amp; OTT Covid response, &amp; only a minority of people have 'confronted racism' (whatever that means) because the majority didn't behave in a racist way beforehand &amp; have nothing to confront/apologise for.
1300781158460989440 2020-09-01 21:02:50 +0800 <SteveCass14> @markoftheD Sadly, I think that for some, one of the ways they show disdain for their own history &amp; culture is to ignore the bad in others (especially non-Western) and portray them as pure and unsullied. Nonsense of course but it seems to make them feel good about themselves.
1300706079379197952 2020-09-01 16:04:29 +0800 <SteveCass14> @MikeNayna You see this all the time in the MSM. Take a bad/difficult but rare or small minority situation and portray it as if it's the norm. It's a way of getting people to consider the matter with their emotions not their reason.
1300700628541415425 2020-09-01 15:42:50 +0800 <SteveCass14> @EricsElectrons Indeed. They have lots to hide behing the thin facade of righteousness.
1300698128518176769 2020-09-01 15:32:54 +0800 <SteveCass14> @philsenior77 @MaajidNawaz @SamHarrisOrg Your tweet translated to, 'you may be telling the truth but you shouldn't because it might get the candidate I don't like elected'. This is exactly the closed-minded 'my guy at all costs' thinking Maajid fights against. Truth, honesty, transparency is the only ethical way.
1300695518339837952 2020-09-01 15:22:31 +0800 <SteveCass14> @ProfessionalJu2 When your living and reputation relies on bieng a radical ideologue, boring stuff like facts and truth play very little part in their thinking.
