1343722782706835461 2020-12-29 08:57:31 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> How the hell does this even make sense. According to the model on the right, Kamala Harris would replace the Republican vote supposedly, but then there are gray seats? And if they all voted accordingly, it wouldn‚Äôt be 49-51, just 50-51 with the addition of Harris, if Ds win GA

Being non-interventionalist is not a bad foreign policy, it just means we keep to ourselves more. I‚Äôd rather have peace, than invading some random country like Iraq or Afghanistan, and destabilizing them further for no gain whatsoever really.
1343714412826423298 2020-12-29 08:24:15 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @Becker_Blog @NoNODemonkkrats @DelnegroJack 1. GWB failed to reign in the power of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, indirectly leading to the Great Recession through a housing crisis and economic decline. Presidents do have control over some economic policy, and how much of the government is involved in it.
1343676968332623872 2020-12-29 05:55:28 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @danrivercustoms @k123soko Read your first tweet again. (She runs...), implying that it is not a good thing to run during a pandemic, when she could be helping the people, at which point I then stated she doesn‚Äôt currently hold any elected office and therefore cannot do anything. She shouldn‚Äôt run?

1342639016303341569 2020-12-26 09:11:01 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @CottoGottfried I agree, but in hyper partisan times, he would not lose in a landslide. I agree that 1984 and 2020 are very different times, he would probably have to adjust his platform. I was merely pointing out he could win in the right circumstances
1342637617561612288 2020-12-26 09:05:27 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @CottoGottfried He wouldn‚Äôt win in the landslide that he did years ago, but he has a strong chance of winning. He had an enthusiastic base with the kind of ‚Äúcharming‚Äù personality that people know about. He would essentially be a traditional Republican that would mainly take Bush states

1339380932650946561 2020-12-17 09:24:33 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @PappasAidan @Iran_vagabond @ShivM_07 @DilwrAli Minnesota is slightly turning red. It‚Äôs just the fact that this was a D +4.5 year, and coupled with the fact that Trump has very bad suburban appeal. A populist figure that appeals in the rurals while not alienating the suburbs much can win Minnesota.

1337253256167297025 2020-12-11 12:29:55 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @UselessVoid @SoquelCreek @Public_Citizen I believe I worded it weirdly. Yes I know. I‚Äôm talking about how the fetus becomes alive at conception, and I‚Äôm saying it is a person at birth when it comes out of the womb. You asked me when do I consider a fetus a person? I said at birth.

1337250106802843648 2020-12-11 12:17:25 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @UselessVoid @SoquelCreek @Public_Citizen ....However the fetus is still a fetus at conception, and it is still alive with a heartbeat and everything. The fetus becomes living at conception biologically due to cell mitosis, and thus can be classified as alive
1337249588370149380 2020-12-11 12:15:21 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @UselessVoid @SoquelCreek @Public_Citizen My point was they still have them, developed or not, it makes a difference later on in life if they can‚Äôt use their brain because they‚Äôre dead. Your second question is worded quite weirdly, so I would have to say a fetus is a person at birth, yes....
1337116745182703616 2020-12-11 03:27:29 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @UselessVoid @SoquelCreek @Public_Citizen Not about the COVID aspect, but Fetus‚Äôs have brains, albeit not developed. The real issue is that abortion takes away the right that the baby has to live and use their brain. Imagine if your parent denied you the right to life?

1335276693259509760 2020-12-06 01:35:46 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @Maga4Justice @CryptoGlyphic @CottoGottfried After a blue wave in 2018, that was expected. In fact, it‚Äôs underwhelming, considering Republicans should have flipped more to get back to where they were before
1335275042700201985 2020-12-06 01:29:13 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @GabeGuidarini I can‚Äôt stand political dynasties. The trump children shouldn‚Äôt run

However, over the last four years, the msm popularized the Russia hoax to the point it was believe by Democrats and some independents, while the msm crushed the right-winged ones

1334951841570975748 2020-12-05 04:04:55 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @GabeGuidarini Yes, but there should be age limits and if you are so so incredibly high on it that all brain power goes out the window, then there should be fines/punishment/rehab

1334682378074206208 2020-12-04 10:14:10 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @jhofromcanton @senrobportman @SenCoryGardner Generally I agree, but dude, based on your profile you are addicted to Portman. Also, expect both sides to use corporate cash, and it‚Äôs not like Portman does bad in the suburbs. He won Cincinnati and came close to winning Columbus.

1334611999574122506 2020-12-04 05:34:31 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @RedEaglePatriot The poll implies low R turnout because it had the Biden electorate at +4 over the GOP, and IT WONT BE TRUE IF YALL QUIT THE BOYCOTT NONSENSE

They are both supposed to get up to. 100% of the respected vote
1322948920474017795 2020-11-02 01:09:36 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @al_malik98 @ttvlabneh @DonnySpaceForce @serajiyun @MikeHarwell66 @PpollingNumbers @Reuters I don‚Äôt think you know the difference between facts and opinions. These are not my personal opinions. These are facts. Here is a Mitchell Comm. voter registration file- 67% of Dems already voted (Peters), vs. 30% (James). This is according to the Dem vs Rep registration file  https://t.co/f4njTIjyps

Therefore Trump will drastically over perform on Election Day voters. There is nothing to suggest Biden will do good on the 3rd as most Dems already voted

High turnout is good for Biden in the South, but also high turnout is good for Trump in the Midwest. That‚Äôs what allowed Trump to win Wis, Iowa, and almost MN last time around

1322899189593001986 2020-11-01 21:51:59 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @al_malik98 @DonnySpaceForce @ttvlabneh @serajiyun @MikeHarwell66 @PpollingNumbers Literally the only three states early voting is looking good for Dems is in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and in Pennsylvania only about 30% of the 2016 vote has been cast. Also not all Democrats will vote for Biden, so 5% for each nullifies that......

If Biden gets only +5 nationally, it‚Äôs likely Trump will probably carry PA, due to the electoral college system. Most of the popular vote is coming from places like California, so the popular vote will heavily favor Dems

1311272853405224960 2020-09-30 19:53:05 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @Druzzer55 @ThisOldFarmhaus @FoxNews He said ‚Äúsure I will‚Äù three times over the course of that question
1311181932508610560 2020-09-30 13:51:47 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> Oh my these debates were awful, but generally I think they came off as equal. By the way, Trump denounced white supremacy, he said sure, I will. Media is making a big deal about this
1311147651090579463 2020-09-30 11:35:34 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @TimRunsHisMouth @TAftermath2020 It‚Äôs definitely Jeb!

1307800960891224067 2020-09-21 05:57:01 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> Oops. Obama didn‚Äôt mean to say this? Now they‚Äôre saying the Republicans are hypocrites because they want to fill the seat in an election year!
1307425393134141442 2020-09-20 05:04:39 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @ANTHONYBLOGAN Wait I just realized something. Is she in America because she is driving on the left side of the car, unless she is a passenger and just delusional
1307424727032631297 2020-09-20 05:02:00 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> Lol the libs have really lost it!

1303807328869928963 2020-09-10 05:27:45 +0800 <fmrRealBobRoss> @KnSPeace @KamalaHarris @BarackObama @JoeBiden If he‚Äôs too old and senile, why are you supporting him?!!! Don‚Äôt take Obama‚Äôs word on this, it‚Äôs his job to support Joe Biden. MAJOR TIP- do your own research and vote for who you want to vote for! Don‚Äôt just listen to Obama

There are some things that the government does better like USPS and the military etc. You‚Äôre twisting words I never even said.
