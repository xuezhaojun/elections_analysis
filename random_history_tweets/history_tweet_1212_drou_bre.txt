1337172434391273473 2020-12-11 07:08:46 +0800 <drou_bre> Yes those 50 intel that Biden was talking about, are now ordered by Obama/China to get @JoeBiden out to replace him with @KamalaHarris. Everything is falling into place exactly how Obama/China wants it to go. I hope they all go down.

1336762375375106051 2020-12-10 03:59:20 +0800 <drou_bre> She should be removed immediately.

1336733104254357505 2020-12-10 02:03:02 +0800 <drou_bre> @ericswalwell stoked the Russian collusion story for 3 years. He went on every media outlet to bash @POTUS even after he was exonerated.

1336509655539978240 2020-12-09 11:15:07 +0800 <drou_bre> Why is it that  SNL can pack them in like sardines, and no masks, but people who want to go back to church or work are fined?
1336507710725091337 2020-12-09 11:07:24 +0800 <drou_bre> He doesn't even know whom the guy is.

You’re always making people out to be too stupid, too poor, too suppressed that they can’t think for themselves. You have to enforce everything to try to control  them. Wake up people!!

1329065617194934273 2020-11-18 22:15:10 +0800 <drou_bre> @RepJeffries You mean for the Democrats?   If you had your way, Republicans would be rounded up and ....well I won’t go there.

1329062949349101570 2020-11-18 22:04:34 +0800 <drou_bre> @RepJeffries While BLM and Antifa are terrorizing our country, while you and the rest of your party are living high off the taxpayers and lobbyists who fund you.

1329062221448667139 2020-11-18 22:01:41 +0800 <drou_bre> @RepJeffries But the Black Caucus is okay. How about we get rid of the “dog whistles” from the Democrat party. How about looking at your side who allows left wing Antifa and BLM to terrorize and burn down Democrat run cities. Stop funding them and start arresting these thugs!

He barely went out to campaign, and when he did there were only a handful of people there. And most of them, if not all were his staff and the bootlickers at CNN.
1328901938965057536 2020-11-18 11:24:46 +0800 <drou_bre> We need to have an investigation into the Democrats!!

1328899312445763591 2020-11-18 11:14:20 +0800 <drou_bre> No state should allow anyone to vote unless they have been living there for at least thirty days or more!!

1327392978143481857 2020-11-14 07:28:42 +0800 <drou_bre> Where do they find these people?
1327391106129141764 2020-11-14 07:21:16 +0800 <drou_bre> Thank you Mr. President for keeping America safe. If it weren't for you stopping all travel from China &amp; other infected areas, there would be so many more deaths. I can't even imagine how many would have died under Obama/Biden if this had happened when they were in office.
1327389739348090886 2020-11-14 07:15:50 +0800 <drou_bre> No.
1327194399504289793 2020-11-13 18:19:37 +0800 <drou_bre> @kibukofridah @zionpearl @TrumpWarRoom @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden You are praying for a ”New World Leader”?  There's no such thing. God is in control of the world. We have a president who has been trying to run the country for four years, and the left have done everything they can to remove him from day one. He has put America first.
1327191985984335872 2020-11-13 18:10:02 +0800 <drou_bre> They told us ”RUSSIA” hacked our elections for four years. Democrats spent 40 million of our tax dollars on the Democrat ”Mueller” investigation to what to frame President Trump. That didn't work, so now they rigged the elections.
1327189352796082176 2020-11-13 17:59:34 +0800 <drou_bre> @mcuban People can you know... eat, pay rent, function without government assistance!! There's plenty of JOBS out there Mark.

1326903372746780679 2020-11-12 23:03:11 +0800 <drou_bre> I'm sure he was a good man, but is it really worth our tax dollars to rename a clinic? Don't we have enough debt that we, our children and grandchildren have to pay back? There are veterans living on the streets, they need help!

1326624191681064969 2020-11-12 04:33:49 +0800 <drou_bre> We know that whatever the president was given works. We come a long way since we first found out about the virus that came from a lab in Wuhan China, that the Obama/Biden/Fauci administration gave our tax dollars to.

1326621204875268097 2020-11-12 04:21:57 +0800 <drou_bre> @Dragonfly_Drama @realDonaldTrump The left didn't accept the results of the 2016 elections.

1326617856369430533 2020-11-12 04:08:38 +0800 <drou_bre> This election should be thrown out! Voter registrations need to be purged and cleaned up!! No ballot harvesting, you go to the voting booth in person, or you send in a ABSENTEE ballot with a noterized signature, and maybe a specific code from your local Town/City Hall! Period.
1326616682874499072 2020-11-12 04:03:59 +0800 <drou_bre> I love this photo...she looks like my sister-in-law. Except she's a Democrat.  https://t.co/2nNgjOmDvp

1326614191264964608 2020-11-12 03:54:05 +0800 <drou_bre> There are ❤️even videos of poll counters wearing Biden masks. 🤦‍♀️
1326613728717139972 2020-11-12 03:52:14 +0800 <drou_bre> Really?! If you don't know who your representatives are, and can't take the time to learn who they are or watch debates, maybe you shouldn't be voting.
1326612974514163713 2020-11-12 03:49:15 +0800 <drou_bre> Hopefully lots of video footage of fraud.

Millions of babies are ripped from the womb every year, by people who only care about money, not the woman or the baby.

1320017183242682370 2020-10-24 22:59:55 +0800 <drou_bre> It should have been dumped eight months ago!! America  has the right to know who they are voting for. Now half the country has already voted! Why did you wait so long?! Dems would have had it out there the minute they found it, but R’s are always wimps!
1320015841535184899 2020-10-24 22:54:35 +0800 <drou_bre> Why did they wait so long?!! The @FBI needs to be thoroughly investigated! @POTUS should have been firing some folks there a long time ago!! What in the world is going on!
1320014970210439169 2020-10-24 22:51:08 +0800 <drou_bre> Why haven’t they acted on it? If he were a Trump supporter like Roger Stone, he would have been raided in the middle of the night with @CNN filming the whole thing. Sick of this bull sh*t!!

1318963053048844289 2020-10-22 01:11:11 +0800 <drou_bre> Praying for Officer Michael Sales and all of our law enforcement officers. 🙏🙌🏻🙏
1318961485419368453 2020-10-22 01:04:57 +0800 <drou_bre> No. This is absolutely on the Biden’s, and must be exposed! The @FBI have been sitting on it. If it were a Trump supporter, they would have raided them at 2 in the morning with @CNN ready to film the whole thing. I’m so sick of the way Democrats have gotten away with their crimes
1318929539951661056 2020-10-21 22:58:01 +0800 <drou_bre> @RepAdamSchiff Sounds like you are a desperate man, and desperate men say and do desperate things.
1318929299915812867 2020-10-21 22:57:04 +0800 <drou_bre> @RepAdamSchiff We’re not the ones who are “lashing out” at everyone. It’s you , your rioters, and the whole damn Democrat party!
1318922108219654145 2020-10-21 22:28:29 +0800 <drou_bre> That’s the problem. We no longer have journalists, we have liberal activists posing as journalists.
1318920967394033665 2020-10-21 22:23:57 +0800 <drou_bre> They should never be near children or the Executive Office ever again!!

1318917827902976001 2020-10-21 22:11:29 +0800 <drou_bre> Democrats don’t “care” about anyone except themselves, and when have Democrat’s ever been “fair”? These so called psychologists should have their heads examined.
1318916809765146625 2020-10-21 22:07:26 +0800 <drou_bre> Democrats made a big mistake passing over Tulsi! This is a smart woman. I would never vote for a Democrat, after what They have done to this president and to our country, but if Tulsi ever became a conservative, she would have a chance at getting into the Executive Office.

1318779761544626176 2020-10-21 13:02:51 +0800 <drou_bre> @JoeBiden I hope they didn’t flee from a socialist country, because that’s exactly what they’re going to get if Harris/Biden get anywhere near the Executive Office. It’ll be China on steroids. Because China owns Joe. Goodbye jobs, goodbye freedom of religion, 1A, 2A, goodbye school choice.

Keep voting for the same people and this is what you get.  We are now retired, but we had a business and we had to have insurance. File a lawsuit against your city.

1316912714602733571 2020-10-16 09:23:52 +0800 <drou_bre> They even gave Biden better chairs to sit in. How disgraceful!
1316912419994804230 2020-10-16 09:22:42 +0800 <drou_bre> @CNN That's the fault of Guthrie who turned the town hall into a witch hunt. She's the one who didn't give the people who attended, a chance to ask him questions with all of her ridiculous questions.

They are packing the stimulus bill. with bailouts for things that have nothing to do with the how it affects ordinary citizens. All they want is to pack the bill with money for their friends in high places. They are working for is, NOT THEMSELVES!

1314262267580612608 2020-10-09 01:51:57 +0800 <drou_bre> Just look at what President Trump has done for our country, compared to what the left have done. Not what the biased media want you to hear. You may not like him as a person, but he has done everything he promised he would do. Then look at cities run by liberals, endless wars,
1314260467301392385 2020-10-09 01:44:47 +0800 <drou_bre> Please Ken come over to our side...they call us the ”RIGHT SIDE” for a reason. 🤝

1314199834526703616 2020-10-08 21:43:51 +0800 <drou_bre> A vote for Harris/Biden is a vote for this.
1314199553160228865 2020-10-08 21:42:44 +0800 <drou_bre> Not surprised in the least. That's all they have.

1314034904502501376 2020-10-08 10:48:29 +0800 <drou_bre> Agree 100%!,
1314034844859617282 2020-10-08 10:48:15 +0800 <drou_bre> @VP was the winner tonight. @KamalaHarris was clearly lying throughout the debate, and I couldn't stand the way she kept smiling and shaking her head whenever the vp spoke.
1314032278809587712 2020-10-08 10:38:03 +0800 <drou_bre> @VP mikepence won hands down. She lied and glorified herself throughout the debate.
1314029582039814153 2020-10-08 10:27:20 +0800 <drou_bre> @TSwiftNZ @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @vmagazine You have a bad habit of choosing the wrong guys Taylor. 🤦‍♀️
1314027671341408256 2020-10-08 10:19:44 +0800 <drou_bre> Another biased moderator.
1314018866780155906 2020-10-08 09:44:45 +0800 <drou_bre> I said the same thing to my husband when she came out with that.
1314018182932430848 2020-10-08 09:42:02 +0800 <drou_bre> I do too!
1314016911680774145 2020-10-08 09:36:59 +0800 <drou_bre> She is such a liar!!
1313998720418156545 2020-10-08 08:24:42 +0800 <drou_bre> Why doesn't ABC tell the folks why the president didn't want to sign the bill. He wants to give us (US CITIZENS) $1200.00, not illegals, bail outs, and other bs!  https://t.co/9qeUdtfj5C
1313994192293711872 2020-10-08 08:06:42 +0800 <drou_bre> There is no way I would take my sign down if this were on my property.
1313993155402960901 2020-10-08 08:02:35 +0800 <drou_bre> Good luck at the debates tonight Mr. Vice President. Praying for you. 🙏🙌🏻🇺🇸
1313870238170124292 2020-10-07 23:54:09 +0800 <drou_bre> @POTUS just said he was going go declassify everything yesterday.
1313869490669711361 2020-10-07 23:51:11 +0800 <drou_bre> Post this on Bidens, Obama’s social media accounts, and every liberal who is out to bring down this country. We need to get the word out to their followers.
1313867704936390657 2020-10-07 23:44:05 +0800 <drou_bre> 🙌🙌🙌🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
1313861626425159682 2020-10-07 23:19:56 +0800 <drou_bre> While Obama was entertaining his Hollywood friends on our dime.  He never did anything for the anyone but himself and his friends in high places. And the media never said a word about it.
1313861092414812161 2020-10-07 23:17:49 +0800 <drou_bre> I can't even listen to these hypocrites any longer. 😡
1313606723681374209 2020-10-07 06:27:03 +0800 <drou_bre> Barack Obama should be in jail... Joe Biden should be in jail... Hillary Clinton should be in jail.. Loretta Lynch should be in jail.
1313604676986732547 2020-10-07 06:18:55 +0800 <drou_bre> They caused so much division &amp; hatred in our country for our President &amp; those of us who support him. If they don't go to prison, &amp; pay big fines for all the wasted tax dollars that poured into the Mueller investigation, they will do it again. I believe the media were in on it
1313602617948463105 2020-10-07 06:10:44 +0800 <drou_bre> Time to prosecute them all!!
1313602152565215233 2020-10-07 06:08:53 +0800 <drou_bre> And his arrest.
1313600848287670274 2020-10-07 06:03:42 +0800 <drou_bre> They are like a pack of wild animals!!
1313600332132487169 2020-10-07 06:01:39 +0800 <drou_bre> This always make me laugh. 😍😀
1313570677908295682 2020-10-07 04:03:49 +0800 <drou_bre> We must fight back at the ballot box in November! #VOTERED! 🔴🙏🙌🙏🇺🇸✝️
1313569988943458305 2020-10-07 04:01:04 +0800 <drou_bre> Every single Christian better get out and vote Red or we will not be able to ever go to church, worship in public or be free again.

1313564805446463493 2020-10-07 03:40:29 +0800 <drou_bre> While rioters who loot, destroy public and private property terrorize citizens are just an ”idea”. According to @JoeBiden
1313562740137525250 2020-10-07 03:32:16 +0800 <drou_bre> @JoelMcDurmon Are we as citizens free to walk down the street without being accosted in our own communities, by radical left wing groups who are filled with rage and hate?

1313561810054905857 2020-10-07 03:28:34 +0800 <drou_bre> @JoelMcDurmon Amy Coney Barrett will be appointed to the Supreme Court and God Wins.
1313560368891998208 2020-10-07 03:22:51 +0800 <drou_bre> @AJKocman Pro life Christians for Biden? Biden is for killing innocent human beings.

1313550072420892674 2020-10-07 02:41:56 +0800 <drou_bre> @Weinsteinlaw @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris I'm sorry for your loss Sir. But Democrats are not for America. They have done nothing about the destruction across our country. My sister was murdered, and I wish she would have had protection.

1313324876514627589 2020-10-06 11:47:05 +0800 <drou_bre> @CNN And the hypocrisy from the media begins...Did @CNN and all the Trump haters commenting on here see the video of @JoeBiden talking about, the  ”black woman stocking shelves so he could stay home”? No? I didn't think so. You're too busy finding fault with @POTUS.
1313323409082810369 2020-10-06 11:41:15 +0800 <drou_bre> I don't remember @CNN ever being truthful. I stopped watching when Candy Crowley gave Obama help when he was debating Mitt Romney.
1313322769053085697 2020-10-06 11:38:43 +0800 <drou_bre> @CNN And the hypocrisy from the media begins...
1313322479943852035 2020-10-06 11:37:34 +0800 <drou_bre> Is ALL LIFE protected, or is it pick and choose whose life is protected?
1313322112002723840 2020-10-06 11:36:06 +0800 <drou_bre> She will follow the US Constitution. Why is it that you will fight tooth and nail for LGTQ and womens rights, but if we mention religious views or preborn babies right to life Democrats have a fit?
1313321085962784768 2020-10-06 11:32:01 +0800 <drou_bre> @YEW2019 @JackPosobiec If you were ever a Trump voter, or a Christian. I must be Mother Theresa.
1313318629107216386 2020-10-06 11:22:16 +0800 <drou_bre> Or Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and other Dems who are Catholic in name only.
1313315721049444358 2020-10-06 11:10:42 +0800 <drou_bre> The @FBi never even took the  @DNC server in for examination. Can you imagine that?!

The party that supports aborting babies up until birth, the party that wants to take our Constitutional rights away, give our hard earned money to people who come here illegally. You sir are a Dem.
1313288192389513217 2020-10-06 09:21:19 +0800 <drou_bre> @ShaneClaiborne President Trump is a pro life president, he has done more to protect our religious rights than any Democrat ever has or ever will.

1311310318212190208 2020-09-30 22:21:57 +0800 <drou_bre> Biden also has @chriswallace and a mike in his pocket.
1310668397777227781 2020-09-29 03:51:11 +0800 <drou_bre> @IAmDawnM I’ll block you instead.
1310667251109036032 2020-09-29 03:46:38 +0800 <drou_bre> Threatening to withhold one billion United States tax dollars to Ukraine if they did not fire the prosecutor investigating corruption at Burisma which so happened to employ Biden’s son Hunter for a whopping 166,000 a month.   https://t.co/EWogL5OWKx  https://t.co/5SLgwFzunD
1310664137521991687 2020-09-29 03:34:16 +0800 <drou_bre> Something doesn’t ring true here.
1310663639737794563 2020-09-29 03:32:17 +0800 <drou_bre> Margo, I agree with everything you said, except “lady”.
1310663085955461128 2020-09-29 03:30:05 +0800 <drou_bre> Was it an “anonymous source” again?
1310661379049902082 2020-09-29 03:23:18 +0800 <drou_bre> She did this during Brett K. hearing. Dems are such bullies!!
1310661050971365376 2020-09-29 03:22:00 +0800 <drou_bre> Awesome!! @DanCrenshawTX has a great add also. Love these new updated adds!
1310655343324803073 2020-09-29 02:59:19 +0800 <drou_bre> Keep calling them out!!
1310654969654030336 2020-09-29 02:57:50 +0800 <drou_bre> He’s getting worse as the days go by...never mind weeks.
1310641192879771650 2020-09-29 02:03:05 +0800 <drou_bre> Who votes for these hateful Democrats?!!
1310640986977177603 2020-09-29 02:02:16 +0800 <drou_bre> Why are people electing these hateful Democrats?!  https://t.co/opYv0pzIoE
1310638639303602178 2020-09-29 01:52:56 +0800 <drou_bre> So sorry to hear. 😢
1310637122328592384 2020-09-29 01:46:55 +0800 <drou_bre> Not any longer. Government is too big and are out for their own political agendas.
1310626203800350722 2020-09-29 01:03:31 +0800 <drou_bre> There are quite a few corrupt Democrats who should be expelled from Congress.
1310618142230614016 2020-09-29 00:31:29 +0800 <drou_bre> If NYC wants to open up and get their freedom back, they better vote #TRUMP2020

1310600018894770176 2020-09-28 23:19:28 +0800 <drou_bre> @StephenKing @Jennybing53 Anyone who watches your movies or reads the trash you write, is just as sick as you are.
1310598653044719619 2020-09-28 23:14:03 +0800 <drou_bre> Yet they take sanctuary in churches when they are rioting, to avoid arrests. Churches need to wake up!
1310598269937029120 2020-09-28 23:12:31 +0800 <drou_bre> @georgesoros is funding the riots, the ballot harvesting, the BLM, Antifa and the chaos across our country. He should be exiled from America like he was from is home country. He causes chaos and destruction wherever he goes.   https://t.co/r6wEMGxGWl  https://t.co/VlbM84fLY6
1310594127617294336 2020-09-28 22:56:04 +0800 <drou_bre> I hope he was fired!! At the very least charged with theft!!
1310590432783499266 2020-09-28 22:41:23 +0800 <drou_bre> Wow! If this could happen to them, it could happen to anyone!  Watch your children and grandchildren very closely!
1310587581004943360 2020-09-28 22:30:03 +0800 <drou_bre> Now the left are telling people what they can eat!
1310586487096971267 2020-09-28 22:25:42 +0800 <drou_bre> The fact checkers would say true, that Biden got to the senate 180 years ago.
1310584470941114372 2020-09-28 22:17:42 +0800 <drou_bre> Good idea!!
1310578238511554561 2020-09-28 21:52:56 +0800 <drou_bre> We need to start over again, and vote in person in every single state!!
1310350929535922176 2020-09-28 06:49:41 +0800 <drou_bre> Believe them when they tell you who they are. This is what Democrats are.
1310345868814540800 2020-09-28 06:29:34 +0800 <drou_bre> @PaulBarasi Democrats are the ones who have a religion problem. You are the ones who are always trying to crucify us for our beliefs.
1310339247312953344 2020-09-28 06:03:16 +0800 <drou_bre> But it’s okay for Democrats to attack a Republican woman.
1310338811507867650 2020-09-28 06:01:32 +0800 <drou_bre> I hope the Dems remember this when they try to crucify Amy Coney Barrett on her religious freedom.
1310336339410378752 2020-09-28 05:51:42 +0800 <drou_bre> He should add the BLM terrorist organization also.
1310332193986809860 2020-09-28 05:35:14 +0800 <drou_bre> Yes, and there’s this...   https://t.co/ZLoIlLr1Yn
1310332010964058113 2020-09-28 05:34:30 +0800 <drou_bre> @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris You didn’t “ build back better” in the 47 years you were in office, and  people  actually believe you will do it now? You can barely speak and walk at the same time for crying out loud. 🤦🏼‍♀️
1310330846482702339 2020-09-28 05:29:53 +0800 <drou_bre> @RidgeGlobal @reedgalen Not surprised. Another DEEP STATE Swamp dweller.
1310330594614816774 2020-09-28 05:28:53 +0800 <drou_bre> @AlecMacGillis @reedgalen You can’t be a Christian and vote for the party who supports killing pre born babies. A true Christian and Republican does not support abortion. “Thou Shalt Not Kill”
1310328390126383110 2020-09-28 05:20:07 +0800 <drou_bre> @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris So don’t  VP decisions....   https://t.co/Qfeu0lwqDn
1310327851946831873 2020-09-28 05:17:59 +0800 <drou_bre> @KamalaHarris Her advice should have been: Don’t go out with a married 60 year old man when you’re 28 to further your career.   https://t.co/TwZr8Qjz9p
1310327256431165440 2020-09-28 05:15:37 +0800 <drou_bre> @KamalaHarris @TheRock He’s endorsing someone who calls other people “immoral” while she dated a married man who was 30 years her senior, just so she could get ahead.   https://t.co/TwZr8Qjz9p
1310326584214278144 2020-09-28 05:12:57 +0800 <drou_bre> @KamalaHarris It’s not Ginsburg’s seat. It’s not your call. It’s the choice of the President of the United States of America.  And that is Donald J. Trump.
1310323837179965440 2020-09-28 05:02:02 +0800 <drou_bre> @DrEricDing Does it help when looters and rioters go out every night?  https://t.co/wmISUaG0BT
1310322506897686530 2020-09-28 04:56:44 +0800 <drou_bre> @JackieIversArch @DrEricDing Now do the rioters.

1310317823634403330 2020-09-28 04:38:08 +0800 <drou_bre> My children have never rioted.

1310296863279644673 2020-09-28 03:14:51 +0800 <drou_bre> Also...not sure “heaven” is where she went @chuckschumer.

1310288343759028225 2020-09-28 02:40:59 +0800 <drou_bre> @vanessagrigor I can tell. 🤦🏼‍♀️
1310288256119042050 2020-09-28 02:40:38 +0800 <drou_bre> @vanessagrigor Seriously?! You have a problem.  https://t.co/lmsM4WbAUi
1310286727899217926 2020-09-28 02:34:34 +0800 <drou_bre> @vanessagrigor I don’t know if you have kids or not, but every woman I know, who has kids, are able to work and be a “loving present mom” no matter how many kids they have. 🤦🏼‍♀️
1310285511613915136 2020-09-28 02:29:44 +0800 <drou_bre> @SenSchumer @vanessagrigor How in the world do people like Chuck Schumer ever get elected?
1310278799355973632 2020-09-28 02:03:04 +0800 <drou_bre> I can’t follow either. 🤯
1310273250061156353 2020-09-28 01:41:01 +0800 <drou_bre> @DrIbram Or maybe they just adopted them out of the goodness of their hearts.  Racist much?
1310272744299298818 2020-09-28 01:39:00 +0800 <drou_bre> ESPECIALLY when the Democrat candidate for president is a practicing catholic, and the Democrat Speaker of the House is a practicing Catholic.
1310269333571096578 2020-09-28 01:25:27 +0800 <drou_bre> @Bro_Magnon @adamcarolla Feel free to wear a mask or stay home. 🤧😷🤕

1310259274120134657 2020-09-28 00:45:29 +0800 <drou_bre> @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris It’s very sad that actors who make their money off of ALL Americans,would  go public with who they are voting for.
1310257730096115712 2020-09-28 00:39:20 +0800 <drou_bre> I tried to follow you, but Twitter says I’m at my limit. 🤯
1310238867832926218 2020-09-27 23:24:23 +0800 <drou_bre> She’ll do anything to get back into the White House.
1310238599435218944 2020-09-27 23:23:19 +0800 <drou_bre> Someone tried to tell me that each individual vote doesn’t matter because of the EC. But when I did some research I found out that my vote wouldn’t count because I live in a small state. Keep the Electoral College.  https://t.co/H2avvmcOl0
1310235281522601985 2020-09-27 23:10:08 +0800 <drou_bre> No. Our climate is always changing and  if the left are so worried about it, why do they travel in luxury jets, cars, boats, etc.? But lecture to the rest of us.
1310234709352423424 2020-09-27 23:07:52 +0800 <drou_bre> The Supreme Court Justices should have to go through a competency test after a certain age. Same for running for the POTUS, I even like to see local and government offices doing this.   https://t.co/DcuZIM420S
1310233749255319556 2020-09-27 23:04:03 +0800 <drou_bre> RBG did not respect our US Constitution.   https://t.co/AKaMOZ1UrB

1310231288507510795 2020-09-27 22:54:16 +0800 <drou_bre> He’ll be a no show.
1310230968398118914 2020-09-27 22:53:00 +0800 <drou_bre> I would have chosen: None of the Above.
1310230768162086913 2020-09-27 22:52:12 +0800 <drou_bre> I’d ask about his involvement in Burisma, Benghazi, Fast N Furious, Seal Team Six, Selling US uranium to Russia, 150 billion to Iran, Red Line, the coup, IRS, released terrorists, etc.    https://t.co/fXoaHTdBtr
1310229330186973184 2020-09-27 22:46:29 +0800 <drou_bre> No, I couldn’t care less what Cindy McCain has to say.
1310228990750330881 2020-09-27 22:45:08 +0800 <drou_bre> Because Hillary and Harris picked people who are a little too far left for Uncle Joe.
1310228371083792385 2020-09-27 22:42:41 +0800 <drou_bre> Absolutely NOT!
1310228025783525377 2020-09-27 22:41:18 +0800 <drou_bre> 🙏🙏🙏
1310227872804634624 2020-09-27 22:40:42 +0800 <drou_bre> But if they do, I’ll walk right through them. Nothing is going to stop me from voting for President Trump and straight ticket RED!
1310226671778369536 2020-09-27 22:35:56 +0800 <drou_bre> Good question Missy. I don’t think my state would allow them to harass and intimidate us like they are allowed to do in other states. God Bless America, God Bless President Trump. 🙏🇺🇸
1310225261741387780 2020-09-27 22:30:19 +0800 <drou_bre> The left will say and do anything to smear good people.

1310224559656914945 2020-09-27 22:27:32 +0800 <drou_bre> Finally someone on msm calling out @SpeakerPelosi. This is the @POTUS , we elected him. When she talks this way she is talking to us. We have a right to hear both sides of the debate.
1310223444601167879 2020-09-27 22:23:06 +0800 <drou_bre> It’s a free for all sh*t show now!! The left wing activists think they can do whatever they want now! Why...because they are like spoiled children who have always gotten away with their temper tantrums.
1310222881113231360 2020-09-27 22:20:52 +0800 <drou_bre> She needs medical assistance. Crazy!!
1310222168438038528 2020-09-27 22:18:02 +0800 <drou_bre> My God, just go visit her and give her some love!! I’d go to prison to visit my loved ones!! @andrewcuomo needs to be locked up for killing our loved ones!!
1310218420764504064 2020-09-27 22:03:08 +0800 <drou_bre> I will never believe we have a “rule of law” again, until the people who perpetrated the coup on @POTUS are prosecuted.
1310218049136582658 2020-09-27 22:01:40 +0800 <drou_bre> How about protecting our vote from crooked Democrats?
1310217846555893760 2020-09-27 22:00:51 +0800 <drou_bre> In person voting, with photo Id’s is the best way to stop voter fraud. Also camera’s and other forms of intervention like stiff laws if people are caught would stop the voter fraud.
1310217134648295425 2020-09-27 21:58:02 +0800 <drou_bre> Make sure you look into Democrats like the Main Stream Media, George Soros and others interfering in our elections.

1309971346420649985 2020-09-27 05:41:21 +0800 <drou_bre> @tonyschwartz When will Democrats go after Antifa, BLM rioters, looters, Nancy Pelosi, and others for not wearing masks? Why is it always a ”disgrace” when we do it but not you?

1307132159279403009 2020-09-19 09:39:26 +0800 <drou_bre> Our country needs the senate to nominate a conservative justice before the election. This is the most important nomination of our lifetime. Please do this for those of us who voted for President Trump, and the rest of the Republicans. We need you to do this.
1307127896583135232 2020-09-19 09:22:30 +0800 <drou_bre> Absolutely!

I disagree with him on just about everything that comes out of his mouth, and the faces he makes when he disagrees with someone on the show. He makes my blood boil, but sometimes I feel a bit sorry for him.

1305990453544837120 2020-09-16 06:02:42 +0800 <drou_bre> They should be fired.
1305990034894528522 2020-09-16 06:01:03 +0800 <drou_bre> @POTUS should be informed about this, if he doesn’t know this already. Which I’m sure he does. Fire them all!!
1305988176041836544 2020-09-16 05:53:39 +0800 <drou_bre> I just can’t watch @KamalaHarris , like @HillaryClinton her voice is like listening to finger nails scratching a chalkboard.

1305941698170757121 2020-09-16 02:48:58 +0800 <drou_bre> @POTUS should use this in his campaign adds. This is what Democrats have done to our country. They have no fear of the law, because of liberals who run these cities, they have no morals, no love or empathy for their fellow man. Very sad.
1305891600351014916 2020-09-15 23:29:54 +0800 <drou_bre> @KingJames is king in his own mind.  Has he given up his money, time or anything to black communities? Or is it only to the Marxist’s at BLM? He should go to China and stay there, since he supports the communist party of China.
1305890800375664645 2020-09-15 23:26:43 +0800 <drou_bre> The only way you’d hear from this guy is if it were a white cop shooting a black man.
1305889676214046721 2020-09-15 23:22:15 +0800 <drou_bre> This breaks my heart to see two of our heroes having to go through this horrible nightmare!! All I can say is: If people can’t see the left are walking DEMONS, they are one of them.

1305874805669978112 2020-09-15 22:23:10 +0800 <drou_bre> @IlhanMN Undocumented means they are NOT citizens of the United States of America period. And as an elected official you are breaking the laws of this country by encouraging people to vote who are not legal citizens of the US. @IlhanMN must be impeached and removed from office!  https://t.co/suTCrEbk33

1305872104643059713 2020-09-15 22:12:26 +0800 <drou_bre> @IlhanMN should do some research. The US is ranked way down on the list of polluters.  But according to another site the worst polluters by state in the US, California is ranked the highest.   https://t.co/oCHrXB3kgF   https://t.co/ZlGDKvScTC
1305870657046155264 2020-09-15 22:06:41 +0800 <drou_bre> @thehill @IlhanMN According to the World Health Organization, which liberals treat as their God...The US is way down on the list of polluters.   https://t.co/ZlGDKvScTC

1305862565017407488 2020-09-15 21:34:31 +0800 <drou_bre> @shannonrwatts You mean like the Democrats are doing?!! Shoveling huge amounts of money to terrorists to burn down cities across America?!! While liberal so called leaders watch them burn!!
1305862010467495937 2020-09-15 21:32:19 +0800 <drou_bre> @AndrewBatesNC Really? Why hasn’t @joebiden condemned the terrorists who are looting , burning, killing and tearing down liberal run communities?
1305860732697927682 2020-09-15 21:27:15 +0800 <drou_bre> @GarrettHaake @TexasTribune Really? You wouldn’t know it by the size of the crowds at the rally’s.  @POTUS ‘ is overflowing with supporters compared to  Biden’s.
1305857652606590977 2020-09-15 21:15:00 +0800 <drou_bre> My family, friends, and neighbors are feeling the same way. We don’t feel safe any longer. There’s no other time in my lifetime that I know of, where our local leaders are allowing criminals to terrorize  our communities. There’s no longer law and order in liberal run states.
1305716606727790593 2020-09-15 11:54:32 +0800 <drou_bre> @RashidaTlaib @RashidaTlaib is a serious threat to the United States of America, and should be immediately removed from office and deported. This is a lie and you know it!

1305713941742604288 2020-09-15 11:43:57 +0800 <drou_bre> @JoeBiden Do you seriously think we are going to give up our weapons now..with all of your Democrat paid for thugs going around burning, looting, killing police, terrorizing us, and calling for the physical removal of the president we voted in?!! You need to go to the retirement home now!
1305711636276301825 2020-09-15 11:34:47 +0800 <drou_bre> Looks like it’s been taken down.
1305711263415238656 2020-09-15 11:33:18 +0800 <drou_bre> And idiots on the left will vote for this. 😡
1305710368573005825 2020-09-15 11:29:45 +0800 <drou_bre> I wish the @FBI would look into @JoeBiden..if he’s brazen enough to fondle little girls in public, right under their parents noses, I can’t even fathom what he’d do in private. 🤢😡
1305709125943341057 2020-09-15 11:24:49 +0800 <drou_bre> @KamalaHarris knew all along she would be sitting in the Oval Office instead of @JoeBiden...if God FORBID they are elected.

1305696771964833792 2020-09-15 10:35:43 +0800 <drou_bre> Sickening!
1305694562766196736 2020-09-15 10:26:57 +0800 <drou_bre> This could be @BarackObama ‘s son.
1305694374538379268 2020-09-15 10:26:12 +0800 <drou_bre> My prayers go out to all the men and women in blue who serve and protect us and our communities. God bless you and keep you safe.
1305693867736551425 2020-09-15 10:24:11 +0800 <drou_bre> Praying for the two officers who were brutally shot by that evil coward. My heart breaks to see our police treated like this. If Democrats refuse to speak out against this, they are just as responsible for the shootings and riots, as this ANIMAL!
1305692955890638848 2020-09-15 10:20:33 +0800 <drou_bre> I can’t imagine what these officers have to deal with on a daily basis. Just watching these evil demons is enough to make me want to go out and buy a gun. IT-shirt very scary to see how deeply disturbed these people are. I don’t know if it’s from their upbringing or lack there of
1305691929586343936 2020-09-15 10:16:29 +0800 <drou_bre> He’s sick and demented. 🤢😡
1305690293749133312 2020-09-15 10:09:59 +0800 <drou_bre> The aDemocrat Party is a DISGRACE period.
1305688757383892995 2020-09-15 10:03:52 +0800 <drou_bre> Every single one of us, who have accepted Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior must pray tonight for our country. As a Christian I can not, and will not vote for anyone who condones this, who condone killing pre born babies up until birth, who close our churches &amp; our schools.
1305687783453925377 2020-09-15 10:00:00 +0800 <drou_bre> Praying for our nation to heal. Praying for these two peace officers. Lifting them up in prayer to our Heavenly Father, who must be shedding tears for His people. Black, white, brown, pink, color doesn’t matter to Him, He made us all in His image. In Jesus Christ’s Mighty Name.🙏
1305685805294329857 2020-09-15 09:52:09 +0800 <drou_bre> @TalbertSwan You and every single Democrat are just as hateful, just as vile, just as demonic as Satan himself.
1305684467873386497 2020-09-15 09:46:50 +0800 <drou_bre> @JoeBiden should never get anywhere near the Oval Office again!

1305682738578685953 2020-09-15 09:39:57 +0800 <drou_bre> And kill innocent citizens to get what they want. Democrats are evil, hateful snakes and vipers!!

We’ve been trying not to give in to Hollywood, but we love to get together with family &amp; friends for our granddaughter’s outdoor birthday movie night.
1305586798895280132 2020-09-15 03:18:44 +0800 <drou_bre> The police can’t. Their hands are tied by liberal mayors. When they do arrest them, the liberal DA’s let they out.
1305586082151632898 2020-09-15 03:15:53 +0800 <drou_bre> This is an attack not only on this young woman, but on our sovereignty to go about our business without getting punched in the face for our political beliefs.

That’s what’s evil, sick, &amp; demented. If black lives matter so much, why hasn’t BLM spent any of the billions they’ve received on black communities?

Quid Pro Joe,  &amp;  Lefty Lap Dog Wally will be crying like babies by the time President Trump is done with them.

1300779407943102470 2020-09-01 20:55:52 +0800 <drou_bre> @richvillodas I know I’m going to be called a racist for what I am about to say, but here goes. I am sick  of hearing about “racism” every time an election rolls around, calling riots “protests”, making rapists &amp; drug addicts into heroes, while keeping silent when killing unborn up till birth.

I don’t go out and loot, burn down my community or any other. I don’t kill babies, or any other human being. I don’t yell in someone’s face or threaten
1300776863514726400 2020-09-01 20:45:46 +0800 <drou_bre> If I  sound racist, what do you call all of the facts that I listed? II AM NOT RACIST.  Stop using skin color for your failures in life. Everyone is equal in America. The only ones who are showing how racist they are, is people like you who can’t tolerate anyone,
