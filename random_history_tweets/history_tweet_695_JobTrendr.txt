What about a women who goes into labor early and has a c-section? What if it's body is out but it's head is still inside the woman? Is it not a baby then?

The video had parts cut out as any media outlet does. What is clear is them discussing the selling of inborn killed babies. The segments of the discussion was in context and the direct words of the PP PERSON

They never argued and won the case based on manipulated content. They were killing and selling unborn babies' body parts. That's a fact. So again what was fake?

When a word is changed in pronunciation and meaning it no longer meets criteria for a racist remark. The word “Nigga” does not have the same connotations as the vulgar racist N-word. It has been adopted and changed by blacks, whites, Latinos, and Asians.
1343811401459052544 2020-12-29 14:49:39 +0800 <JobTrendr> @vizz504 @draininbuckets @mmpadellan The white dude was a sh!tshow and a total waste. That being said the black guy responded calling the white guy a “Nigga” as well. It clearly wasn’t a racist incident. It was an ignorant white dirtbag wanting to use slang many blacks and whites think make you gangsta and cool

I believe if a woman's life is in danger or she was raped she should have an immediate choice to do what she wants. Most ppl do believe that. So I guess I'm pro-choice? That's what most ppl support. Only the fringe believe like you

Not 5 months down the road though. This isn't religion

If her life is in danger she should be allowed to make a choice.

If a woman wants to force her partner to get a vasectomy I'm ok with that. The man has to have one or not have sex. That will reduce abortions for sure. Let's do this 👍

As medical technology improves the life of the baby improves at younger ages. Abortions will get a smaller and smaller window as the baby will be viable at earlier ages. We are averaging 26 weeks now or so👍

At the point at which the fetus becomes viable the interest in protecting it becomes compelling, and therefore from that point on the state can prohibit abortions. That's a fact as states prohibit abortions after a certain date. VIABILITY IS THE 🔑

That's when a human life (unborn baby) has the right. Roe and Doe (not a misspell) give the woman (1) a privacy interest that outweighs any rights which may be asserted on behalf of the fetus up to the point of VIABILITY

The states have the right to restrict your ability to have an abortion based on viability of the unborn child. That's a fact. If medical tech improves and the viability at lower weeks is capable there will be more restrictions on abortion. Thank GOD👍

The government has the right to force you to have a baby if your irresponsible actions cause you to get pregnant. They currently restrict abortions after a certain timeframe. The courts have ruled on this already

If a woman should be allowed control over her body why should anyone have the right to stop women from killing an human inside her? I say if someone gets pregnant they shouldn't have the right to violate another possible woman's body inside her

You shouldn't have a right to do what you want to another human's body because you were irresponsible!  I don't have a right to kill a human because they would temporarily make my life difficult Row Vs Wade makes that clear
1339275560275632129 2020-12-17 02:25:50 +0800 <JobTrendr> @KlasfeldReports What courts have agreed to hear the evidence and determined it was a lie?

If no at what point does it become a human life, and what is the reason it becomes a human life? Does the passing through a 6-inch birth canal make it a human life? Is it not a life 2 minutes before it passes through? You ppl are deranged

What's draconian about a law that protects the life of an unborn child! The question is if an unborn baby is a human life. Again a drunk driver that kills mom and unborn gets double murder charge! Why?

To be honest I think it's a long shot BUT lets be honest and admit it has already succeeded. Close if not Half of the country doesn't believe Biden won. They think the democrats cheated (they did) and this is all that's really needed
1338603324325683200 2020-12-15 05:54:37 +0800 <JobTrendr> @BandyXLee1 Yes Biden must be removed before he might get in

If you want to vote absentee then ask for it AND prove why you need it. we dont mass mail ballots. Not acceptable
1337777335743950849 2020-12-12 23:12:26 +0800 <JobTrendr> @PatriciaLavatai @hanna_P12 @JusR3ading1 @realDonaldTrump Nope! You don't get to pass blame on GOP for democrats being racist. Biden is racist it has always been democrats in the south and north that were racist. No GOP. And I the parties didn't switch., if you use that excuse list the politicians other than 1 (Thurman) that switched.

You can't show proof if the judges won't accept hearing the case.. Everyone knows there was fraud and cheating. Pa Gov changing election law (iowgal), Detroit boarding up windows, Ga rejection rates at .06 when normally it's over 3%. Come on man
1337775749009432584 2020-12-12 23:06:07 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ChrisMurphyCT They weren't legal votes! The Pa gov changed election laws on the eve of the election, votes were changed and the excuse was ”clerical errors”, boarding up windows in Detroit so ppl couldn't see, and rejection rates in Ga at .006 when normally its over 3%!! This isn't democracy

I'm neutral to it because I know it's an attempt to not talk about the truth. Your commmet ”No fraud because you don't know who did it or their intent” then to say ”there was most likely fraud but it didn't change anything” is a parody

1337515336913006594 2020-12-12 05:51:20 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ingersoll_bob @GaSecofState there is already requirements to prove you reside in an area. That means showing bills or mail sent to your home. And ID doesn't hurt the homeless anymore than those requirements. You need to reside and it should be mandatory to prove who you are. To argue otherwise is insane
1337514751593766915 2020-12-12 05:49:01 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ingersoll_bob @GaSecofState wasn't exaggerating about my childhood. I believe Americans should vote but also have requirements that keep the process fair and give ppl faith in the system. It should be mandatory just like showing ID to buy beer. What's more important? The argument against ID is ridiculous

Several races were won by slim margins. One at the moment by a 6 point vote lead. There were many “clerical errors” some amounting to thousands of votes. It’s not clerical issues when it ALWAYS benefits 1 candidate
1337486327516979213 2020-12-12 03:56:04 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ingersoll_bob @GaSecofState never said I was dirt dirt poor! I said I grew up dirt dirt poor. Big difference. I knew you would bring up the homeless. The fact is homeless can’t vote without proof of residence in a location nor do they. You need to prove you live in the area and you should have to show ID

There is more than enough evidence of vote changes and discrepancies that all evidence should be heard. In GA alone the typical rejection rate of mail in ballots has been 3% or more. 2020 .06% Come on man!!!!

1336847170285277186 2020-12-10 09:36:17 +0800 <JobTrendr> @AdamParkhomenko Nope  the cheating dems did this
1336846851409121280 2020-12-10 09:35:01 +0800 <JobTrendr> @GoFishLynn @ipinky77 @steve_vladeck Nope! How stupid are you ppl? Hillary received less than 50% of the vote! How in the H€ll is that be a majority! My God you ppl are ig nor 🐜
1336846519648063489 2020-12-10 09:33:42 +0800 <JobTrendr> @GoFishLynn @ipinky77 @steve_vladeck Yes and a prosecutor can claim a ham sammich is guilty of a crime but the jury (Senate) decides if the sammich is guilty.  The articles of impeachment passed in the house but he was acquitted in the Senate! Catch-up dear  https://t.co/jNNz0nspQZ
1336839425565843462 2020-12-10 09:05:30 +0800 <JobTrendr> @imjdsharp If @tedcruz wins this I will knock on every door in western Ohio for his 2024 presidential run!!! I will personally bring him coffee and 🥐s daily! And if he owns dogs I will walk them and bag their turds, put it on Nancy’s front porch, light it, and knock twice 🤣😂🤣🤣
1336835775967727619 2020-12-10 08:51:00 +0800 <JobTrendr> @GoFishLynn @ipinky77 @steve_vladeck Nope the house impeached him because democrats are crazy and had control. Just like they did holding covid relief because of the election. The Senate ruled on the evidence presented by the House. They deemed it insufficient as they should have. You ppl are some kinda Kray Kray
1336835064009777152 2020-12-10 08:48:11 +0800 <JobTrendr> @GoFishLynn @ipinky77 @steve_vladeck Yeah and facts are over your feelings! Hillary didn't get 50% so she didn't receive a majority. She received a plurality! That means over half of the country didn't want her. I really wish we could divorse half of the country and rid ourselves of radical lunatics like you
1336830919861268480 2020-12-10 08:31:43 +0800 <JobTrendr> As an Ohio voter I hope the @OhioAG will sign on to the Texas @Scotus lawsuit! we on Ohio are dependent of all other steeds to follow their rules for national elections. This was not done and needs to be rectified
1336829412772294659 2020-12-10 08:25:43 +0800 <JobTrendr> @Droobie81 @Skunkitude @Greg_Faltin @WalshFreedom Yes both sides commit voter fraud! Thanks for playing

1336822243503067138 2020-12-10 07:57:14 +0800 <JobTrendr> @GoFishLynn @ipinky77 @steve_vladeck You apparently have been watching to much Nancy Pelosi!! the house presented the case and the senate ruled on it! He was not convicted! The investigation he asked for was what of the Bidens actually were guilty of🤣😂 so he was right  please educate yourself on the process
1336812600462630915 2020-12-10 07:18:55 +0800 <JobTrendr> @GoFishLynn @ipinky77 @steve_vladeck Nope! The Senate after hearing the evidence he wasn't guilty! So impeached and exonerated in the senate is an accurate statement!! Lastly the majority did not choose Hillary!! She received a plurality not majority 🤣😂
1336722406753366016 2020-12-10 01:20:31 +0800 <JobTrendr> @lawhergirl @TriBeCaDad @WalshFreedom They didn't bring the lawsuit because they couldn't until it happened. Unfortunately that's the way it works. They tried to bring suit when changes were made and the courts said they didn't have standing until after the fact
1336706153095585794 2020-12-10 00:15:56 +0800 <JobTrendr> @McKaylaRoseJ @ReverendWarnock Yep Matthew 7:15 I was thinking Matthew 7-22:23 also applies to this fake Christian

1336705521576005632 2020-12-10 00:13:25 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ReverendWarnock So what you're saying is you think a woman's right to kill unborn children is a stronger right than an unborn children's right to live? Matthew 7:22-23 your parishioners should examine 👇 Matthew 7:15 You're a disgrace
1336702168007630849 2020-12-10 00:00:06 +0800 <JobTrendr> @GoFishLynn @ipinky77 @steve_vladeck 1. ”impeached” in the house and and exonerated in the senate🤣 2. Hillary didn't win a majority popular vote 3. If Trump is responsible for covid deaths then Obama/Biden is responsible for 12,000 H1N1 deaths and many million deaths or displacements from starting a war in Libya

Threw the company out and nationalized 3 oil rigs that belonged to seadrill. They also took over several oil drilling service companies equipment from USA that we're there helping PDVSA. They used ”it was national interest” to seize them
1336471301192634368 2020-12-09 08:42:43 +0800 <JobTrendr> @RepAdamSchiff Blame Nancy you prix

1336469016144195584 2020-12-09 08:33:38 +0800 <JobTrendr> @whatisyouranswr @AniseSugarman @McKaylaRoseJ One comment was true 1. Venezuela nationalized their oil industry in the late 70s 2. I am not talking about him ”taking over independent” He seized foreign companies oil rigs and equipment 3. That's why companies in future refused to go back 4.PDVSA is ruined because of Chavez
1336395771227365381 2020-12-09 03:42:35 +0800 <JobTrendr> @whatisyouranswr @AniseSugarman @McKaylaRoseJ He also fired all the experienced PDVSA employees because most want loyal to him. So inexperienced labor with no foreign companies wanting their equipment there because it would be stolen by the state cured the meltdown in their oil production
1336394999441842177 2020-12-09 03:39:31 +0800 <JobTrendr> @whatisyouranswr @AniseSugarman @McKaylaRoseJ And the fact is Venezuela was one of the safest and most prosperous countries in South America before social and Chavez was introduced
1336394779333111811 2020-12-09 03:38:39 +0800 <JobTrendr> @whatisyouranswr @AniseSugarman @McKaylaRoseJ Nope! I never said PDVSA was started during Chavez. I worked there and was a subcontractor for PDVSA. Chavez nationalized foreign oil companies and any equipment they had in the country. Weatherford, transocean and several others lost equipment and even oil rigs.
1336369088315142144 2020-12-09 01:56:33 +0800 <JobTrendr> @whatisyouranswr @AniseSugarman @McKaylaRoseJ He also gave free washing machines and refrigerators to the poor just before election. What he didn’t provide is food for them after election. The whole economy was subsidized on oil. The rich moved and when oil collapsed mostly the poor remained Socialism KILLS
1336368733560954889 2020-12-09 01:55:09 +0800 <JobTrendr> @whatisyouranswr @AniseSugarman @McKaylaRoseJ Chavez nail in the coffin moment was when he nationalized (foreign) oil companies (I was there working in the oil industry). The result was no companies would go back into Venezuela and PDVSA didn’t have the experience to do the work(Chavez fired the experienced who opposed him)
1336367978540118016 2020-12-09 01:52:09 +0800 <JobTrendr> @whatisyouranswr @AniseSugarman @McKaylaRoseJ 2/2 crime was low and they had a thriving economy. Chavez indoctrinated a generation of youth into thinking what you own they own!!! Killings and robberies went out the roof! Ppl didn’t excel because the pay was the same regardless of job!  Lastly👇
1336367369346830339 2020-12-09 01:49:44 +0800 <JobTrendr> @whatisyouranswr @AniseSugarman @McKaylaRoseJ Hey Grandpa thanks for the video I assume it was directed as an attack but has fallen short. I lived/worked in Venezuela for over 6 yrs, actually met Chavez, and was there until the Venezuelans started eating their pets under Maduro It’s undisputed before Chavez crime was low 1/2

Everything that may be covid was listed as covid death without even confirming. For healthy ppl the 99.977 percent holds water. Masks don't work. Wash your hands and keep distance
1334650280844128258 2020-12-04 08:06:38 +0800 <JobTrendr> @JJussely @FrankCaputo12 @newtgingrich Yeah I'm not sure we will ever call them out if we don't take the hit and show the main streamers we aren't afraid of holding our vote. We made it through 8urs of Obama. I would prefer going out in flames than to keep this up yr after yr. We can't even get rid of ppl like Romney

They didn't care about the 74 million who voted for Trump and now they want those ppl to keep the mainstream GOP Paul Ryan type guard in power? Are you kidding me? Let's wander in the desert together for 4 yrs

They have rolled over and abdicated there responsibilities! The refused to fight for the 74million trump voters because they don't like Trump. now they want those ppl to keep then in power? Nope
1334611984608882690 2020-12-04 05:34:27 +0800 <JobTrendr> @EWErickson Let the democrats have it!!!!!!! 4 yrs in the desert might wake the GOP turncoat Bstards up! None of them has fought against the 100% apparent voter fraud and NOW they want the very voters they decided not to fight for vote for them to keep power? To h€ll with the mainstream GOP

Don’t take my word for it, just read the cdc report saying 85% of covid positives wore masks! Or the Denmark report showing masks don’t work! You plan on wearing a mask for the next 50yrs? The vaccine isn’t guaranteed u ppl are sheep
1334566582773829634 2020-12-04 02:34:03 +0800 <JobTrendr> @SenMikeLee Protesting in front of someone’s home is not threatening anyone. They may not get much sleep but it isn’t violent. I say put the heat on them. Don’t let up!!! Peacefully protest in front of their door!!!! GOP and Democrats should not be exempt! This mask crap is a control attempt

1334562165676793856 2020-12-04 02:16:29 +0800 <JobTrendr> @EWErickson @newtgingrich Didn’t Trump give to Democrats also? Let’s be honest I don’t think I will vote for GOP again. I’d rather set at home than vote for sneaky ba$stards like the Kemps’ and Ryans of the party. The GOP leaders have Been silent and could care less about the steal. They need to be outed
1334501509011300355 2020-12-03 22:15:28 +0800 <JobTrendr> @newtgingrich Without fair elections America is already crippled! The dems cheated and the GOP didn’t even fight it! Why? Because of orange man bad!!!!!!! If GOP can’t even defend the vote of the Trump 74 million votes why should anyone even want to help the GOP keep their precious power?

That's like a whole city and not ONE person voting Trump U may think it's ok because2-3
1332899078343192577 2020-11-29 12:07:59 +0800 <JobTrendr> @TwinPrincesses @Todd_Bonzales @O_Captain_Ove @congbillposey @jimmythemole01 @TheJusticeDept @realDonaldTrump fraud is a term far older than our legal system. It has a definition and meaning well documented. You're trying to frame the debate in the narrowest which is just silly. If our legal system created the world you'd be right but it didn't. 1-2
1332897465176104963 2020-11-29 12:01:34 +0800 <JobTrendr> @TwinPrincesses @Todd_Bonzales @O_Captain_Ove @congbillposey @jimmythemole01 @TheJusticeDept @realDonaldTrump The word Fraud has been around for at least 700 yrs. The word had meaning long before our legal system was created. if you want to put your lawyer hat on and debate the preponderance of evidence by all means go on ahead and be you! I'll stick with the original definition
1332873794315313153 2020-11-29 10:27:30 +0800 <JobTrendr> @TwinPrincesses @Todd_Bonzales @O_Captain_Ove @congbillposey @jimmythemole01 @TheJusticeDept @realDonaldTrump As I was not arguing criminal court cases I will stick with Webster's definition. If they have it wrong take it up with them and try to change the definition! You liberals are great at that! Until then the definition of Fraud in general terms is what it always has been.

I am not specifying criminal or civil! I'm saying fraud in it's meaning was committed. The term was correct. Joe Biden knew, we know, and the pll who committed the fraudulent acts to steal this election know, and you know!!  https://t.co/WA6C4zcrP7
1332809371882033153 2020-11-29 06:11:31 +0800 <JobTrendr> @TwinPrincesses @Todd_Bonzales @O_Captain_Ove @congbillposey @jimmythemole01 @TheJusticeDept @realDonaldTrump This is so ridiculous! So if someone is a victim identity theft they are not a victim of fraud until the person is caught. Fraudulent acts are done all the time by unknowns and the are still called FRAUDULENT ACTS!  This election is tainted and most ppl know fraud was committed
1332808273897156609 2020-11-29 06:07:09 +0800 <JobTrendr> @TwinPrincesses @Todd_Bonzales @O_Captain_Ove @congbillposey @jimmythemole01 @TheJusticeDept @realDonaldTrump Lastly I think your argument is ignorant at best! If a group of ppl (unknown) cheat to win an election U don't need proof of intent to say what they did was an act of fraud. Again you don't need intent in civil matters. I tell you what, look up the definition and get back to me
1332807558332035076 2020-11-29 06:04:18 +0800 <JobTrendr> @TwinPrincesses @Todd_Bonzales @O_Captain_Ove @congbillposey @jimmythemole01 @TheJusticeDept @realDonaldTrump Let me explain 1 last time Ms Attorney definition of fraud is clear I don’t have to prove intent for fraud because I not distinguishing between criminal or civil prosecution!!! you need intent for one and not the other! Even so the intent is clear when ppl cheat at the ballot box
1332729098569998338 2020-11-29 00:52:32 +0800 <JobTrendr> Some things never change👇  https://t.co/PkSFScINeY

1332487398043873282 2020-11-28 08:52:06 +0800 <JobTrendr> @RoscoAmerican @WalshFreedom Why that’s genius? GOP  is a party because of the ppl in the party. Trump has a 90%+ approval with the ppl in the party! If the GOP did try to rid Trump they wouldn’t have a party. If I were Trump I’d take my half of Americans and start a new party and dig into Dem support

Ppl like Walsh finally admit they have 2 choices Continue on with the Democrat party or just live in America without a voice. These ppl are now toxic to the new Trump Republican Party. They will never matter again on the right

They also pay huge taxes and the cost of living is horrible. trust me when I tell you a low salary McDonald worker in Alabama has a better living standard than a McDonald worker in New York.
1331952797122748418 2020-11-26 21:27:47 +0800 <JobTrendr> @GermanNerd1990 @snackhole69 @singlemomsays @johniadarola @chrislhayes now instead of debating the facts (you now know ur an idiot) you resort to calling me evil🤦‍♂️ I don’t have a problem with ppl getting a helping hand. I was pointing out your stupid argument about blue states paying for red states is stupid. U just 🦜 sh!t without research ☮️ out
1331950302925385729 2020-11-26 21:17:53 +0800 <JobTrendr> @GermanNerd1990 @snackhole69 @singlemomsays @johniadarola @chrislhayes I’m saying democrat voters by a 2-1 margin receive aid the feds send to red/blue states. It’s not the republican voters. If you take your voters to NY the red states would be less than they are per capital right now.. let’s split and you take the bum democrat voters in red states
1331949689541898242 2020-11-26 21:15:27 +0800 <JobTrendr> @GermanNerd1990 @snackhole69 @singlemomsays @johniadarola @chrislhayes 3-3 5.  We should look at per capita basis instead, blue states get more; $2,124 per resident. Red states receive just $1,879 on average So 🦜ing something that you’ve heard on tv by some liberal 🥜job is just stupid bro!  Take your own advice-school up
1331948929349464064 2020-11-26 21:12:25 +0800 <JobTrendr> @GermanNerd1990 @snackhole69 @singlemomsays @johniadarola @chrislhayes 2-2 3.Don’t blame red states because you pay more taxes at the state level 4. red states receive 35.75% on average of their budgets from the federal government. Blue states receive 30.80% because their total budgets are far larger due to all the bloat and waste 2-3
1331946928192565252 2020-11-26 21:04:28 +0800 <JobTrendr> @GermanNerd1990 @snackhole69 @singlemomsays @johniadarola @chrislhayes I knew you would make that stupid argument so let’s do this 1. U can’t use Social Security Bruce’s it was paid into 2. Democrats are about twice as likely as Republicans to have received welfare at some point in their lives. Take them with you when we split 1-2

He's a royal racist POS that has lied to Americans for 40 yrs, making his family millions after blowing the sh!t out of other countries. I'm a non interventionist (no more wars) Biden is a swamp monster that will have us in war again soon
1330689635362672643 2020-11-23 09:48:26 +0800 <JobTrendr> @AmesRhysTaylor @steph93065 Secondly, I could never get behind a guy that believes its ok to kill unborn children all the way up until 9months, a guy who spent yrs calling ppl like me ”Nazis, Dregs of society, Racist), and bailed out antifa/BLM firebombers/ looters just months ago. unity? Not a chance.
1330688831780237319 2020-11-23 09:45:15 +0800 <JobTrendr> @AmesRhysTaylor @steph93065 Biden is a globalist, he sold his seat for 37 yrs, blowing up countries and having his family secure billion-dollar contracts to build them back up. He lies worse than Trump, he passed laws targeting black men, he has always been a horrible racist like the democrat partytypically  https://t.co/KDvK3JqiWz

1329089536899465218 2020-11-18 23:50:13 +0800 <JobTrendr> @GolfedUp @heythats_mytaco @MzaneFaust @kmkm5779 @craydaysinusa @adam_brew Not true. Poll watchers were not given access. Using binoculars to see ballots isn't access, boarding up windows (why would a polling location docthat?) so ppl couldn't see is not access.. This should be a transparent process.  Go on ahead and ram ur head back into that hole bro

1329087797198614534 2020-11-18 23:43:18 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ldcl35 @adam_brew Do Ya really think after all the losses democrats have received because of twisting and rewriting the rules that winning by dirty books is a good way to go? You ppl are a joke, you think 1 win by cheat is going to change the cold war we are in. On to the next battle
1329087228539150341 2020-11-18 23:41:03 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ldcl35 @adam_brew 3-3  REID nuked senate for lower-level court appointments - GOP nukes them for Scotus Gerrymandering started by democrats and perfected by GOP no SCOTUS appointments in last yr - started by Dems ballot harvesting in Ca- GOP started posting harvest boxes everytime dems are outdone

Already documented cases. Of course it was clerical errors. We also have thousands of illegal votes in places like Nevada. Elections are now decided by 100s in some cases.
1328815741047541764 2020-11-18 05:42:15 +0800 <JobTrendr> @wilson_hugh @smalltownandrew That’s the problem. High ratings will allow them to continue. Fox owners are responsible and will only feel the pain of ppl switch off. I like watching tucker but just can’t do it anymore

Several local elections have already be over turned due “clerical errors” giving the democrat votes they didn’t receive. The msm called the democrat the winner. That’s why they don’t decide who won! When the states certify the results the winner will be announced
1328430321986117634 2020-11-17 04:10:44 +0800 <JobTrendr> @FrankLuntz I’m sorry can you explain to everyone when the states certified the election results? Or does the media just get to call it and that’s it? If that’s the way it is you better tell the several ppl who recently were declared the winner after the media said they lost

How many unborn babies lives are worth Trump's tweets?

I voted for someone who will pass polices that protect innocent unborn children, Christian bakers rights, Nuns rights, and the rights of individualism. How many children have you been apart of killing with your Biden vote? I guess mean tweets are worse

1324857755216252931 2020-11-07 07:34:38 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ProgressTroll @bellstory100 @stillgray Nobody is advocating using force to take an election. What pll are saying is only legal ballots be counted. If democrats controlled cities refuse to follow the law then they are the ones trying to take an election by force. Take it o the courts if they can't abide by law

1324456446076006401 2020-11-06 04:59:58 +0800 <JobTrendr> @MZHemingway @GovRonDeSantis My Gov @MikeDeWine is a disgrace. I promise you ill vote democrat for Gov of Ohio next election. Why have a 🐍 in the grass like a Mike
1324455715730313216 2020-11-06 04:57:04 +0800 <JobTrendr> So @GovMikeDeWine says we will respect the decision if Biden cheats his way into office! no Mike we won't. I would like to tell you what many of us will do. We will vote against your re-election. I should never have voted for you. I would rather a democrat than a 🐍 like u
1324453836866654214 2020-11-06 04:49:36 +0800 <JobTrendr> @RealChristina93 @samanthamarika1 @JohnJamesMI He is being cheated. He needs to fight
1324453686257590272 2020-11-06 04:49:00 +0800 <JobTrendr> @JohnJamesMI John, you are one of the few to truly be admired! A real fighter for the ppl. Accept defeat ONLY if it's EARNED by your opponent. Do not CONCEDE unless it has been proven through a transparent recount you lost
1324451294057320452 2020-11-06 04:39:30 +0800 <JobTrendr> @AllanSchlosser @ericawerner The war is or over you clowns
1324450140258738182 2020-11-06 04:34:55 +0800 <JobTrendr> @Pragmatictakes @LindseyGrahamSC And to think I donated to Lindsey last month. Seems to have been a big mistake

I am so tired of theses weak kneed GOP politicians. Hey Mitch, We fought to keep you in that seat you better start fighting for us
1324423492658483200 2020-11-06 02:49:01 +0800 <JobTrendr> @tulin_edwan @Patriot4NC @thehill What a childish response!☝️ by the way those lawsuits will reverse the results of voter fraud is found as it should. We don’t live in Venezuela! Also something for the legally challenged-Pa is GOP statehouse controlled. They don’t have to vote to give Biden their 20 votes.
1324420436906647552 2020-11-06 02:36:53 +0800 <JobTrendr> @JasonMillerinDC You realize that fake news is what the Philly Dems will use as an excuse for refusing to let Us in. They will use this intentional game news propaganda to stop legal action against them. These ppl should be in jail. This is the shot heard around the world! This isn’t the old GOP

1324401843913564161 2020-11-06 01:23:00 +0800 <JobTrendr> @the_mod_woman why does anyone have a right to pick on white women for voting trump when Latinos and blacks also vote for trump? You think it’s ok to ostracize someone for their vote? I must remind you democrats voting for Biden are the ones promoting racism and violence  Dems R party of racist  https://t.co/qOzZoHTEpG

1324388556069081089 2020-11-06 00:30:12 +0800 <JobTrendr> Well this about sums us up at the moment. America should never be allowed to criticize another countries “free and FAIR elections”  https://t.co/lPsSAtWZ70
1324388209833529344 2020-11-06 00:28:49 +0800 <JobTrendr> @MaybeAmes That’s most of the weak kneed gop party politicians. I wonder where  @BrianKempGA is?🤔
1324383303256911873 2020-11-06 00:09:20 +0800 <JobTrendr> @Barack_McBush @newtgingrich Actually there are several hundred thousand ballot counted for the senate race in Mi than trump received in Mi. 🤭 If they are on the same ballot as you say please take a crack at explaining that one
1324379661464461312 2020-11-05 23:54:51 +0800 <JobTrendr> @McKaylaRoseJ I’m actually thinking I should just go ahead and move back to Venezuela

1324293016971022336 2020-11-05 18:10:34 +0800 <JobTrendr> @BretBaier Fox News is a disgrace! Who’s bright idea was it to let a hardcore liberal make election calls? I’d be saying the same thing if Fox hired Rudy to make the calls. On top of that you have @ChrisStirewalt pushing polls out for months that were pure propaganda! USA deserves better

1324254548857409538 2020-11-05 15:37:42 +0800 <JobTrendr> @JoeBiden That’s not gonna happen. You can take that to the bank Joe. Democrats aren’t going to cheat you into the WH and then want to sing kumbaya!! This was the first shot. Only down hill from here

1324248688798113792 2020-11-05 15:14:25 +0800 <JobTrendr> @brian_sensebe @GaRepublicans @DavidShafer Dude there is precinct there have more votes casts than there are voters registered! All for Biden. Drops of over 300k ballots without a single vote for Trump. You need to check yourself
1324245697756102656 2020-11-05 15:02:32 +0800 <JobTrendr> @benweiser @CottoGottfried Legally is the keyword. The numbers are clearly off by millions. You have some areas where vote totals are higher than voter registrations. It may happen to Trump this time but always remember it may happen to you next time. This isn’t how we want elections conducted

1324227440198197248 2020-11-05 13:49:59 +0800 <JobTrendr> @alexsalvinews @TRElections @AP So you’re telling me a news agency knows the totals faster than the gov agency on charge of voting? gotcha👍🤦
1324225160472383488 2020-11-05 13:40:55 +0800 <JobTrendr> @davidchapman141 @realDonaldTrump They are cooking the books right now. Said there are 75k ballots left in heavy dem areas to be counted.

1324221776373698560 2020-11-05 13:27:28 +0800 <JobTrendr> @BrendanKeefe @Wizard_Predicts As many as it takes for Biden to win., we know what's going on. Not gonna end well

1324220092109017090 2020-11-05 13:20:47 +0800 <JobTrendr> @CottoGottfried And Biden gained 15k. So trump less is now down the around 16k I think. To much cheating going on. Trump needs to set on the ballot boxes. Shut this dem coup down

1324204011604582401 2020-11-05 12:16:53 +0800 <JobTrendr> @naeblissss @TRElections I think Trump should take his 60 million supporters and start a new party. Let's let someone with ”better character” pewd the handful left in the GOP
1324203223541010432 2020-11-05 12:13:45 +0800 <JobTrendr> @atrupar Looks like @FoxNews is going to catch a ratings decrease

1322784039120633856 2020-11-01 14:14:25 +0800 <JobTrendr> @andreatalbot031 @ElijahSchaffer per the CDC 85% of covid positive patients are ppl who wore a mask. Let's be honest shall we, if masks stopped the transmission places like Italy(heavy mask-wearing country) wouldn't be having a high explosion of covid. You plan on wearing a mask forever? Who knows we get vaccine

The Democrats needed a 200k plus early vote lead on election day to have a chance. While GOP was registering new voters (200k more) the democrats sat in the basement for fear of covid. They didn't knock on doors

PA Democrats are wanting exactly what I said. If you agree with me a ballot should only be counted with a postmark no later than Election Day, and a verified signature we are not in disagreement

If a ballot has a legible postmark (not smeared etc..) no later than Election Day then I rhino it should be counted. Problem is dems are pushing for weeks after election,smeared postmarks, no postmarks, no signatures, and not verifying signatures. It's radical

1322513818380107776 2020-10-31 20:20:40 +0800 <JobTrendr> @MJLegan @Rasmussen_Poll Trump will get more votes this time. Not being rude but Florida is all but doomed for Biden already. Trump has over 90% support with his followers(the ones who voted last time for him). And he's doing double digits better with black and Latinos and dems destroyed their ED VOTE

If Trump wins and polls are that far off it's because you pollsters have been cooking the books for Biden. Elections are local! Trump doesn't have control to cheat in places like PA, MI, WI!!! Maybe ppl like me lie to you so-called pollsters

At this point polls don't matter. Biden is already losing Florida pets see if he holds up in PA. If not it's over. I'm sure all the democrat voters rioting in Philly isn't helping Joe

1321030076054573056 2020-10-27 18:04:48 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ACLells @regulargirlmn @NateSilver538 Yes but if he said (he did) “if trump wins Florida then Biden only has” you take Bidens chance and subtract from Trump chance. There is only 2 players boys. One can’t have a 54% and the other have a 14%. That equals just under 70%. Where is the other 30%?

Why do you think they will change their vote this time?

1320791686470082563 2020-10-27 02:17:31 +0800 <JobTrendr> @rashyzouis @snowmanomics @PolarBarrett Well polls do have their own won't polls. Each candidate also have polls. Again I don't know if it's correct. What I do know is all the polls are all over and nobody really knows who will win. It is close because our country is very divided. I think To the point of hatred.

The fact is California and NY doesn't pick the president, battleground states do. Yes once someone is elected they are the president to the whole country. That of course is irrelevant until a person wins. We will all know on Nov 3rd
1320790107532726274 2020-10-27 02:11:15 +0800 <JobTrendr> @SehzadeSoroush @JasonMillerinDC And Biden is a racist! As is most of the democrat party.  https://t.co/wXVgPN7dIn

I pointed out how so many of you are ig nor 🐜 by not realizing they were talking about new voter registrations not new party-affiliated voters.

1320789212040515586 2020-10-27 02:07:41 +0800 <JobTrendr> @rashyzouis @snowmanomics @PolarBarrett I don't believe polls much. The argument ppl were trying to make is the comment was a lie because MI doesn't do party registrations and I was pointing out moat likely that isn't what they were referring to. Whether they are correct or not wasn't my point

Also using national polling narratives to suppress voting! Doesn’t make a difference in a candidate loses California by 10 or Texas by 10. If trump wins this will be the last time these shady pollsters get away with it

1320100344207126530 2020-10-25 04:30:22 +0800 <JobTrendr> @fightfor46 @XochforCongress I do think Biden will kill oil/gas! Why? Because that's what Obama/Biden tried while in office. I've worked in offshore oil/gas for over 20yrs. Under Obama, we suffered. I haven't forgotten. The economy is coming back better than if Biden was in office. Biden can't spell JOB
1320094359849738240 2020-10-25 04:06:36 +0800 <JobTrendr> Yep 👇 uppity liberals talking down to the working man/woman  https://t.co/4J5LD6dXec

1320068450434375681 2020-10-25 02:23:38 +0800 <JobTrendr> Interesting fake polls still say Trump will lose. Look at google search ”how to change my vote” 1 day after Trump destroyed Biden in debate. all the others that haven't voted yet are going to feel the same and vote Trump @benshapiro @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow @RealJamesWoods  https://t.co/TNTYEtXVew

I think America is so polarized not many ppl are switching back and forth. If you not a hate trump person by now you're most likely going to pull the lever for Trump. We have polls showing 15 points plus. No way that many ppl are bouncing around wondering who to vote 4

That's why they have now come put as usual about this time with ”rhe polls are tightening” and Nate Silver is doing what he does best. Hedge. I don't know if Trump will win but I do know it's going to be close. The polls have a blowout for Biden and that's not happening

Frank Luntz was just caught. This election is close

1318771683667415046 2020-10-21 12:30:45 +0800 <JobTrendr> @UncleAKnows @UnCavMyDynamo @Garyatty @SeanLangille @JakeBGibson Hunter signed the laptop over if not picked up and paid for. Then FBI used a subpoena to take laptop from the computer guy. Chain of custody basically. Biden could stop all this by coming out and saying it isn't his. Problem is his lawyer already said it was and Joe is in hiding

Biden was great friends with dem sen Byrd a KKK leader, he was a segregationist saying he didn't want his kids to grow up in a jungle!

Trump has a ground game and Biden camp has Covid basement syndrome. They actually quit knocking on doors

1318278859914174466 2020-10-20 03:52:27 +0800 <JobTrendr> @debmack__ @ProudLibPat @wsteaks Correct, but at least I’m consistent.  I consider myself an independent and even I hold more conservative views than you. That’s the reason I responded. It would be the same if I am against abortion, big govern, more freedoms, pro 2nd and saying “I’m a dem voting trump” Good luck

1317356043622645760 2020-10-17 14:45:30 +0800 <JobTrendr> @jgmitzen @mac__steele @PaulaReidCBS @BoKnowsNews Yeah we do know. Biden has not said the emails weren't real. That would be easy to do. More info is coming out and now other media sites are getting the docs. Only thing Biden said was his schedule doesn't show him meeting anyone. He has a 3 hour hole in his schedule that day

Biden was good friends with KKK leader Dem Sen Byrd, and Biden was against desegregation  wake up

1317335148996759552 2020-10-17 13:22:29 +0800 <JobTrendr> @mac__steele @PaulaReidCBS @BoKnowsNews Yes not sure how you came to that conclusion. It was on Hunter's laptop with photos of hunter passed out with crack pipe on his mouth. Sometimes it's not Russia bro. Sometimes a politician uses his power to enrich his family. That's what Joe has done. Just look at the emails

The dem party is off the rails. The violent protests, abortion up to birth(they say its rare but to even advocate for it is crazy), and labeling USA as systemically racist. Never again

1317279110671093760 2020-10-17 09:39:48 +0800 <JobTrendr> @Wendy_Ferguson @caththegreat012 Trump is causing you to work 4 jobs or take mind-altering medication? Please explain how trump did that to you? Before the virus, we had the lowest unemployment rate in my lifetime. I don't blame trump for the virus anymore than I blamed Obama for swine flu.
1317278309672169479 2020-10-17 09:36:37 +0800 <JobTrendr> @Wendy_Ferguson @caththegreat012 2/2 my daughter and her husband also saw a pay raise by lower taxes. It can't be disputed that working families have had their taxes reduces and the average wage has went up several thousand dollars. All Obama/Biden gave was shovel ready jobs that weren't shovel ready
1317277880754241539 2020-10-17 09:34:55 +0800 <JobTrendr> @Wendy_Ferguson @caththegreat012 Yes I am in the top 1% earners but both my parents are on a fixed income. They now have eye and dental and lower prescription costs. My mother was just telling me today Trunp has been positive for her and my fathers Medicaid/medicare. Lastly my daughter is middle class and saw1/2
1317276811827515394 2020-10-17 09:30:40 +0800 <JobTrendr> @Wendy_Ferguson @caththegreat012 Actually, my timeline is consistent. I've only been on Twitter around trump election. Before Trump I have never voted GOP
1317275931598356480 2020-10-17 09:27:10 +0800 <JobTrendr> @Wendy_Ferguson @caththegreat012 your abortion comment “it’s a man’s attempt to control a women” is strange considering Every woman in my life is anti-abortion. it’s not a woman or man thing. It’s a life or not life thing Is an unborn baby a human life? If a man kills a pregnant women is it double murder?
1317267133231935488 2020-10-17 08:52:12 +0800 <JobTrendr> @Wendy_Ferguson @caththegreat012 I appreciate the cordial debate👍 I will answer each of your tweets in kind. First off I would like to point out I have never voted GOP. Like my mother and father I was always a blue dog democrat union trade worker. This is what ppl keep missing 1-?

He also was against desegregation saying he didn't want his kids to grow up in a jungle! He was also good friends with KKK chapter leader Dem Sen Byrd. And passed laws to unfairly attack black men! Isn't that enough?
1317214593631064066 2020-10-17 05:23:26 +0800 <JobTrendr> @Jamiles Yes you are correct. He never said ”super” but he did say they were Predators and passed the crime bill that put thousands of black men in jail. He also was against desegregation of black ppl saying he didn't want his kids to grow up in a jungle. Come on man! This isn't hard.
1317166544821116929 2020-10-17 02:12:30 +0800 <JobTrendr> @JoeBiden Are you removing the Trump tax cuts? If so middle-class taxes will go up just by removing them. Quit lying Joe
1317163800311844865 2020-10-17 02:01:36 +0800 <JobTrendr> @BobsSolutions @EmmaKinery Yea because you want us to vote for a racist who was actually against desegregating black ppl. I think you should embarrassed  of yourself first

They have already started turning the gears by saying 2 ppl on their side has tested positive for Covid. There is no way Biden is going to do the last debate. To much corruption and unanswered questions
1316759667301908480 2020-10-15 23:15:43 +0800 <JobTrendr> @HillaryClinton Yea and that why we have politicians that can make new laws. Judges shouldn’t have that right
1316759261452603395 2020-10-15 23:14:06 +0800 <JobTrendr> Senate @SenTedCruz and @LindseyGrahamSC will be forcing @jack to appear before them for blocking news media and trying to influence the election. Oh yea

Why would we want to be under Biden? The guy can’t create a job if his life depended on it. Mark my words Trump will take Ohio. From my estimates Our union is totally in the bag for trump
1316610313454845956 2020-10-15 13:22:14 +0800 <JobTrendr> @NateSilver538 Bwah ahahaha. Ohio blue? I live in Ohio and work a union job with many different union trades. I’ve met one person pro Biden. Dude your gonna be really embarrassed on election night. AGAIN!

1316601734563758082 2020-10-15 12:48:09 +0800 <JobTrendr> @KwikWarren Biden made the racist policies by passing a law that locked up black men by the thousands. Trump fixed it. Biden fought against desegregation saying he didn’t want his kids to grow up in a jungle. Biden was the one friends with KKK wizard Sen Byrd No wonder Cube don’t trust Dems
1316589313937805312 2020-10-15 11:58:48 +0800 <JobTrendr> @Mzhy_99 @stillgray You realize how many times he has denounced groups like the KKK? You’re the one supporting the real white supremacist. Biden was against desegregation saying he didn’t want his kids to grow up in a jungle. He was also good friends with Dem Sen Byrd who was a KKK grand wizard!!!!

This election will be close but keep on believing those “Biden is 16 points up suppression polls” the RNC has massively out registered voters in battleground states and trump hasn’t lost support from 2016.

Meanwhile, Biden hasn't apologized for working with segregation pushers! He actually said he didn't want his kids to grow up around black kids. He he was good friends with a KKK leader. For goodness sake what's wrong with you!
1316504446755655680 2020-10-15 06:21:34 +0800 <JobTrendr> @AmazinglyCrapt1 @icecube First hand speech- BIDEN was against desegregation saying ”I don't want my kids to grow up in a jungle” he was good friends with Dem Sen Byrd a KKK Grand Wizard. He made fun of Indian gas station owners and used the N-word in the senate. Ice Cube is right to work with both sides

As we know more about the virus we can fight it better. We were told masks don’t work then they do then some actually makes Covid spread worse then lockdowns to slow the spread then lockdowns until we die then lockdowns are bad

If you want to talk policy I'm happy to. Trump has defended religious liberty - under Obama/Biden Christians were under constant attack! Trump has put judges on the bench that's pro-life. 1/3
1315827023756046336 2020-10-13 09:29:44 +0800 <JobTrendr> @nickiesmydog @ericawerner @berriesandblood Ps- I'm happy you thought I was important enough to take the time!! I have 0 guilt for defending unborn children from the liberal Blade of abortion, I have 0 guilt of my religious beliefs, and I have 0 guilt wanting more freedoms not less. That includes the 2nd amendment.
1315826244622200832 2020-10-13 09:26:38 +0800 <JobTrendr> @nickiesmydog @ericawerner @berriesandblood They can set it to as many or least as they want. FDR tried it and that didn't do so well. The fact is when GOP is in they put as many judges as possible and so does democrats. If each party starts increasing SCOTUS it will only result in the other party doing it.

Packing the court is raising the number which in turn would push the other side to raise the number when they regain power. Before long we will have more SCOTUS Judges than senators🤣😃 what a joke

I work union and with many different union trades everyday. I’ve met 1 Biden supporter and everyone else despises him. Of you drive 75 from Dayton to Cincinnati you'll see the favorite. I guess I could be wrong

A warmonger who was actually against desegregation saying he didn't want his kids to grow up in a jungle. Biden's on the wrong side until the polls come out. This guy is a disgrace

BIDEN said ”come on man it's an ideology” I agree with that but I also believe Antifa has a structure and should be labeled a domestic terrorist org

Trust me that's a 100 percent lefty there. Don't know any Trump supporters who would have supported Bernie or occupy wall street  he's another radical liberal
1315783967535247362 2020-10-13 06:38:38 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ShoppedDickyV @mymichaelryan @MrRyanMustang @AndrewJB97 @TaraLaRosa Well what exactly are you saying then? Wee are we even disagreeing if we both agree it's illegal to shoot someone for snapping you. I said that repeatedly and you disagreed. Go back and read your comments. Any reasonable person can see where we both stand on the issue
1315781246119796740 2020-10-13 06:27:49 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ShoppedDickyV @mymichaelryan @MrRyanMustang @AndrewJB97 @TaraLaRosa And lastly, you might want to catch up. He has an antifa tattoo ok right arm, he is connected to wall street movement and other leftwing movements, and again per Joe biden you can be antifa just by ideology alone

You keep saying it's legal to shoot someone for slapping you.I will tell you again. It's illegal and if you do it your life is forfeit. Quit defending this behavior! Someone on here may believe you
1315779760396677121 2020-10-13 06:21:55 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ShoppedDickyV @mymichaelryan @MrRyanMustang @AndrewJB97 @TaraLaRosa More evidence now. fake security guard (antifa guy) was the one who approached the guy he shot. He tried to take his mace, the guy pushed him in the face, then the fake security (antifa guy) pulled his sidearm, then the guy tried to mace him, then was shot. Stand ur ground? nope
1315778784092655616 2020-10-13 06:18:02 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ShoppedDickyV @mymichaelryan @MrRyanMustang @AndrewJB97 @TaraLaRosa No but you do have to prove any reasonable person would feel the same. Pepper spray being slapped won't work. Bit hey bro go on out there and be you! Maybe you will get to share a cell with the loon who thought the same as you do now 🤣🤣

Being slapped doesn't count bro... I'm telling you a person has to believe their life is in EMINENT danger and/or to stop a felony and can only match force. You can't kill someone because they touch u

1315623881621807105 2020-10-12 20:02:31 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DaisyGirlUSA @kaitlancollins As for Trump mishandling Covid I’d respond While Trump was shutting down travel dems were calling him racist for it Dems were tellling ppl to go to fairs (pelosi) dems a were putting Covid patients in nursing homes (Cuomo) and dems were telling ppl to ride the subway (De Blasio)
1315623235510296576 2020-10-12 19:59:57 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DaisyGirlUSA @kaitlancollins He only said permission was not given to use his comments and he hasn’t endorsed a candidate. He made them on national TV and nothing in the ad was taken out of context because it was his exact words. He made several statements saying TRUMP did everything he requested to be done.
1315622218139865090 2020-10-12 19:55:54 +0800 <JobTrendr> @BBisaillion @DaisyGirlUSA @kaitlancollins *China new year
1315621603464687616 2020-10-12 19:53:27 +0800 <JobTrendr> @BBisaillion @DaisyGirlUSA @kaitlancollins So in closing I would say Trump admin did a good job under the circumstances I mentioned above and the fact the the guy Biden had leading the swine flu response said Biden did everything wrong with swine flu, and we got lucky. Democrats could not have done anything better.
1315620897777168384 2020-10-12 19:50:39 +0800 <JobTrendr> @BBisaillion @DaisyGirlUSA @kaitlancollins 2/2 Fauci said “nothing to worry about” the CDC/Fauci said don’t wear a mask then wear any type of face covering because you can transmit it 2 weeks Before symptoms then some face covering actually spread the virus worse then you can’t transmit it before symptoms
1315619855773515777 2020-10-12 19:46:31 +0800 <JobTrendr> @BBisaillion @DaisyGirlUSA @kaitlancollins When Obama failed to keep 12k Americans who died of swine flu safe I didn’t blame him. In Jan Pelosi was telling ppl nothing to worry about please go to China new your, De Blasio was telling ppl to ride the subway, and Cuomo was putting Covid positive patients in nursing homes1/2
1315618866706382849 2020-10-12 19:42:35 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ShoppedDickyV @mymichaelryan @MrRyanMustang @AndrewJB97 @TaraLaRosa I never said there was an escalation clause. I said you have to use equal force. That’s a fact. The fake security guard (Antifa member) used in equal force and now charged with murder. Take my advise and don’t shoot someone who slaps you. It’s not legal use of force
1315618382641852418 2020-10-12 19:40:40 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ShoppedDickyV @mymichaelryan @MrRyanMustang @AndrewJB97 @TaraLaRosa First off nobody else was even talking to the guy that did the shooting. Secondly ppl yelling at you doesn’t make it a life threatening situation. If they had mobbed him you may have a case. Now we find out the shooter wasn’t even a security guard. Told u   https://t.co/Tbbc9gmc6G
1315469718132846592 2020-10-12 09:49:55 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DaisyGirlUSA @kaitlancollins My nerves are just fine. Fauci made the comment speaking about the trump admin.. he gets the Blame and the credit. Fauci also said Trump followed every advise he gave him, including shutting down the country. I might point out WHO just came out and said not to lockdown.
1315469008922083328 2020-10-12 09:47:06 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ShoppedDickyV @mymichaelryan @MrRyanMustang @AndrewJB97 @TaraLaRosa Yes you cannot by law use unequal force. Having your 🧠s best out on the pavement would make most ppl fear for their life. Someone b!tch slapping you is not deadly force therefore you can’t shoot someone. Trust me the guy is going to jail as he should
1315468543224434688 2020-10-12 09:45:15 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ShoppedDickyV @mymichaelryan @MrRyanMustang @AndrewJB97 @TaraLaRosa Yes a skateboard and fighting for his gun and one of the assaulter rust actually had a handgun themselves. I think That’s more of a reason to use deadly force than someone who slaps you in the face.. I say arrest them all and let the jury decide. Your guy is going to jail bro
1315455930641907714 2020-10-12 08:55:08 +0800 <JobTrendr> The experts (WHO) have changed their minds again. Dr Nabarro from WHO- “And so, we really do appeal to all world leaders: stop using lockdown as your primary control method. Develop better systems for doing it. Work together and learn from each other” @realDonaldTrump right again
1315455231774224384 2020-10-12 08:52:21 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DaisyGirlUSA @kaitlancollins He did NOT explain why was taken out of context! He complained his words were used in a political ad. He made the comment on national TV and was not made in private. So again what in the ad (his words) were taken out of context?
1315426578617241601 2020-10-12 06:58:30 +0800 <JobTrendr> @Travis48361432 @KatiePhang Exactly what was out of context? Fauci said this on national TV and was very clear with what he said. Nothing out of context there. If so let Fauci explain exactly what was misleading
1315426320650825728 2020-10-12 06:57:28 +0800 <JobTrendr> @KatiePhang Maybe he can explain what was taken out of context? Sounded pretty strait forward. “Nobody could have done more” let’s wait to see if Fauci explains what exactly was out of context
1315425989795733504 2020-10-12 06:56:10 +0800 <JobTrendr> @jakkiisaid @kaitlancollins His comments. Hating Trump doesn’t change what he said
1315425830961655809 2020-10-12 06:55:32 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DaisyGirlUSA @kaitlancollins The ad uses the exact words from the doctor that you trust! He said it and there was nothing to take out of context. If so let the Doctor explain exactly what was incorrect. You don’t need permission from Fauci to use words he used on National TV
1315425286289346563 2020-10-12 06:53:22 +0800 <JobTrendr> @kaitlancollins It was his words and they were not twisted. Exact phrases
1315424276087033862 2020-10-12 06:49:21 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ShoppedDickyV @mymichaelryan @MrRyanMustang @AndrewJB97 @TaraLaRosa Doesn’t matter the cops said don’t follow. That’s irrelevant. Yes allegedly Martin was bashing his head into the concrete. Like I said I have no love for Zimmerman but he had a right to to use lethal force IF it happened they way they said which the jury believed.
1315423667849965573 2020-10-12 06:46:56 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ShoppedDickyV @mymichaelryan @MrRyanMustang @AndrewJB97 @TaraLaRosa Reaching into a car with a knife on the floorboard after fighting with police does justify lethal force. Let’s be clear they were called their by the black woman(victim) who had had raped in the past. Any reasonable person would understand this
1315375359873998851 2020-10-12 03:34:58 +0800 <JobTrendr> @HannahDrake628 @BardsFM You sound like Joe Biden and his constant dodging. Face it your comment only works with ppl who disagree with you. If it were a black person you’d be screaming excessive force and murder  Have a nice day
1315374932528955392 2020-10-12 03:33:17 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ShoppedDickyV @mymichaelryan @MrRyanMustang @AndrewJB97 @TaraLaRosa Martin was bashing zimmermans head into the concrete. They were on the ground actively fighting. The jury concluded it was legit stand your ground. I personally think Zimmerman is trash but that’s besides the point. As for the other Blake had a knife in his car per reports.

1315373685117775872 2020-10-12 03:28:19 +0800 <JobTrendr> @HannahDrake628 @BardsFM Just like Antifa BLM and the many black involved shootings by police. See we both agree👍 looks like shootings for just about anything is now fair game. No need for anymore protests as everything is justified now
1315373331974156289 2020-10-12 03:26:55 +0800 <JobTrendr> @HannahDrake628 @BardsFM * Breonna  Now the the grammar is out of the way I will again repeat I’m happy we are both on the same page. I will agree with you. Now that we agree there isn’t a need for BLM as almost all of the police involved killings meet your low bar threshold and then some. See we agree
1315372720910217224 2020-10-12 03:24:29 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ShoppedDickyV @mymichaelryan @MrRyanMustang @AndrewJB97 @TaraLaRosa Wrong. Unequal use of force is illegal. I can’t shoot you for punching me unless I feel my life threatened. It has to fall into the reasonable person box. I’m just telling you if you shoot someone for pushing you or slapping you your life will be different as you know it.
1315372116414472192 2020-10-12 03:22:05 +0800 <JobTrendr> @HannahDrake628 @BardsFM Great so Brianna Taylor was a tragedy but the police were justified to return fire, Brown attacked a cop, Martin tried to crack a dude’s head open on the concrete, looks like you feel all those were justified shootings. Glad we agree on something
1315371687651803137 2020-10-12 03:20:23 +0800 <JobTrendr> @HannahDrake628 @BardsFM “Leave ppl alone”? Ok Anytime a BLM or Antifa protestors touches a person or tries to burn down there property and catch a bullet I hope you come on twitter and say “they should have left ppl alone” I assume u agree police can shoot anyone who assaults them
1315367288128901121 2020-10-12 03:02:54 +0800 <JobTrendr> @HannahDrake628 @BardsFM Lastly I’m glad you think hitting someone and spraying mace on them is reason to use deadly force. If that’s all someone needs by liberal standards not one more time should a liberals say anything about a police shooting.
1315366862373490689 2020-10-12 03:01:12 +0800 <JobTrendr> @HannahDrake628 @BardsFM I really wish liberals would say wait on the facts when a police officer shoots someone! I’m curious do you feel the same way about Rittenhouse? Attacked by a mob, beaten to the ground, one assaulter had a handgun himself, and another one tried to take his gun. Stand ur ground?
1315366287611170818 2020-10-12 02:58:55 +0800 <JobTrendr> @Jr_Sanchez_1 @icowrich @Zach_NO_20 @sjwdebates @ElijahSchaffer So we can shoot someone in the face for slapping or using mace on us? That’s your standard? Let me answer for you! Yes that’s your answer until it’s someone who agrees with you then you will scream the exact opposite. What’s your position on Rittenhouse? U feel the same way?
1315365738664919040 2020-10-12 02:56:45 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ShoppedDickyV @mymichaelryan @MrRyanMustang @AndrewJB97 @TaraLaRosa Which ones? The standard is “a reasonable person” would feel threatened. If you point out examples I will agree or disagree with your assumption. I can’t comment on such a general statement
1315365292038598656 2020-10-12 02:54:58 +0800 <JobTrendr> @wasitthat @AndrewJB97 @TaraLaRosa What is it with the left and proud boys? Are they hiring down cities like Antifa and BLM??the chairman of the proud boys is a black Cuban so stop with the race pimping. Fact is Antifa is just like the brown shirts. That being said I could care less about proud boys. No fan here
1315364038692483072 2020-10-12 02:49:59 +0800 <JobTrendr> @icowrich @CitizenStudious @Jr_Sanchez_1 @Zach_NO_20 @sjwdebates @ElijahSchaffer What would happen? Police shootings are not common when you factor in the amount of interaction they have with the population. How many police assaults vs them killing someone. Even when trying to make a felony arrest. Your assumption is as ig nor 🐜 as you are
1315309635516149760 2020-10-11 23:13:49 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ShoppedDickyV @mymichaelryan @MrRyanMustang @AndrewJB97 @TaraLaRosa Yes if someone is trying to take your firearm, hitting your head into concrete, or beating you with weapons then most reasonable ppl will assume they would feel their life was threatened also. Slapped in the face I doubt you get any takers
1315308617810276353 2020-10-11 23:09:46 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ShoppedDickyV @mymichaelryan @MrRyanMustang @AndrewJB97 @TaraLaRosa using mace or slapping someone in the face is not lethal force therefore you cannot use lethal force. The question is would a reasonable person feel their life was in danger. I think the answer is no. By making your argument you will have little room to move in future shootings
1315172288719978497 2020-10-11 14:08:03 +0800 <JobTrendr> @mymichaelryan @MrRyanMustang @AndrewJB97 @TaraLaRosa Ritrenhouse was attacked by 3 ppl while trying to run away. One of those ppl had a firearm, one was trying to take the gun, and the other beat him while on the ground with a weapon. If you want non lethal mace as the bar to kill someone many Antifa will end up dead. Not good
1315171731091398657 2020-10-11 14:05:50 +0800 <JobTrendr> @EvacuationZoneA @ZazzyJets @HannahDrake628 @BardsFM Yes if someone tried to fight you for your firearm you could make that argument. If someone blasts a group with pepper spray you can’t. Let’s be honest who would advocate for shooting someone for that. There was no threat to life therefore you can’t use lethal force
1315170917690093568 2020-10-11 14:02:36 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ZazzyJets @HannahDrake628 @BardsFM Sorry putting your hand in someone’s face isn’t FELONY assault! It is battery but you can’t shoot someone. If that are the case we’d have a lot of Antifa ppl down on the ground bleeding out.
1315170474448613381 2020-10-11 14:00:50 +0800 <JobTrendr> @EvacuationZoneA @HannahDrake628 @BardsFM Nope. Bonnie and Clyde used 0 force. Standing in front of your home with firearms isn’t against the law. The mob destroyed a gate to get into private property. They moved on when they saw ppl were armed. Problem solved
1315170067064205313 2020-10-11 13:59:13 +0800 <JobTrendr> @EvacuationZoneA @ZazzyJets @HannahDrake628 @BardsFM Rittenhouse was running to escape, was knocked to the ground, beaten down by several guyswith skateboards, and someone with a pistol in hand! If your life is in danger Im ok with deadly force. This case there was 0 physical assault before the shooting. Can’t have the bar they low
1315162650544943105 2020-10-11 13:29:45 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ZazzyJets @HannahDrake628 @BardsFM An officer trying to stop a felony in progress is justified to use deadly force. Especially if being tased.civilians can’t go around shooting ppl who use mace. They can shoot someone who is in commission of a felony. reasonable ppl won’t consider this a reasonable use of force
1315161328785518592 2020-10-11 13:24:29 +0800 <JobTrendr> @KellyScaletta So when someone on the left maces someone it’s justified to shoot them?! Huh? Are you deranged? If they were threatening his life (physically) then lethal force is justified. If someone sprays you will mace (non lethal) it’s unequal use of force to shoot someone to death
1315156342643077120 2020-10-11 13:04:41 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ZazzyJets @HannahDrake628 @BardsFM You do realize both sides uses mace. So the next time someone on the left uses mace someone on the other side can open up on them. The guy did not have a security uniform on, he didn’t present himself as security, and used unequal force. His life was not in danger
1315155371263221761 2020-10-11 13:00:49 +0800 <JobTrendr> @HannahDrake628 @BardsFM Sense the liberal left decided to believe every woman, and want to lock up everyone who used force without knowing the facts. Every police shooting is now a crime the second it happens. Even when the person killed had a gun and shot a police officer
1315154725386551296 2020-10-11 12:58:15 +0800 <JobTrendr> @wasitthat @AndrewJB97 @TaraLaRosa Nothing like the Antifa you are defending. They are Antifa by name only.
1315154520868040707 2020-10-11 12:57:26 +0800 <JobTrendr> @MrRyanMustang @AndrewJB97 @TaraLaRosa In a few days when this guys social media posts come out we will see who is laughing. Bottom line the guy used unequal force and is going to jail.. you would think he would be dressed more like security.
1315153606056849409 2020-10-11 12:53:48 +0800 <JobTrendr> @soledadobrien @MeetThePress unfortunately true. Democrats can’t hide behind their fake “I’m a Catholic” narrative anymore. Ppl can judge the tree for themselves. Liberals have attacked Christians/Catholics at every turn. Now they’re attack judge Barrett for being religious. Insanity is believing otherwise
1315152737261285376 2020-10-11 12:50:21 +0800 <JobTrendr> @rob_kp @Dont_Buy_BS @MrAndyNgo Narrative is a guy maxed another guy and that guy used deadly force. It’s unequal application of use of force. The guy is going to jail as he should. If he was being physically attacked you may have a case
1315151269527515137 2020-10-11 12:44:31 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DenverPolice Unequal application of use of force! Who in the h€ll cares what affiliation he belongs to! I hope he doesn’t have any social media posts in defense of Antifa or you (Denver police) will sound extremely bad at your jobs
1315149859327016961 2020-10-11 12:38:55 +0800 <JobTrendr> @icowrich @Zach_NO_20 @sjwdebates @ElijahSchaffer Ahhh nope! Stand your ground doesn’t apply to non lethal force being used against you. If that were the case you could kill just about anyone who comes close to you. Do you realize how dangerous your argument is You should be ashamed of yourself. It could have been someone u love
1315148734989307904 2020-10-11 12:34:27 +0800 <JobTrendr> @CABALknowsALL @Gina66734409 @DMC0821 Yea and one of those terriers was released by a democrat politician! Keep them in jail. All of them. Oh can you please point us in the direction of all the right wing terrorists burning and looting American cities? Asking for a friend
1315148176307912704 2020-10-11 12:32:14 +0800 <JobTrendr> @HannahDrake628 @BardsFM Sorry but “let’s wait for the facts” don’t work anymore! Liberals are fast and furious when it’s the other way around. Besides pepper spray is non lethal force. You can’t legally use lethal force without a threat to your life
1315143557381083137 2020-10-11 12:13:52 +0800 <JobTrendr> @SteelPumpkin75 @darreldrowland Polls show democrats are 9 times more likely to feel comfortable expressing who they will vote for. Trump supporters are much more likely to stay silent

1313485181731438599 2020-10-06 22:24:05 +0800 <JobTrendr> @AMinorGod @Thereal_kj1983 @GarmentsKings @rachelivey @KellyannePolls It's on the video. You could clearly hear her daughter say ”well because that's what I thought” no argument which says a lot considering this child doesn't seem to frightened of her parents
1313483748416122881 2020-10-06 22:18:23 +0800 <JobTrendr> @AMinorGod @Thereal_kj1983 @GarmentsKings @rachelivey @KellyannePolls 2 points unless you were there you cant speak about who said what. secondly again the video clearly shows her mother admonishing her for lying and her daughter accusing the lie by saying she ”thought”
1313483353417494533 2020-10-06 22:16:49 +0800 <JobTrendr> @AMinorGod None of that is relevant and it east fact. Her mother said ”you lied” and she said ”well I thought” she lied and secretly recorded her mother. If you want to talk what's permissible in NJ law, her mother can take that phone legally
1313482748393390081 2020-10-06 22:14:25 +0800 <JobTrendr> @AMinorGod So what you're saying is you don't know but think maybe she was? Again the video shows it was her daughter that lied. As for your last question. If I had something that could kill me I wouldn't tell my children to worry them. I would wait until I knew I was dying.
1313482095591817223 2020-10-06 22:11:49 +0800 <JobTrendr> @AMinorGod @GarmentsKings @rachelivey @KellyannePolls Well I assume she doesn't know she had it and passed it to the rest of her family unintentionally like most other Americans. Do I need to tell my 6 yr old when I'm sick? You tell your kids what you think is best to tell them.
1313481576492212224 2020-10-06 22:09:45 +0800 <JobTrendr> @AMinorGod @GarmentsKings @rachelivey @KellyannePolls How do you know she lied about having COVID? How do you know she intentionally gave her daughter the virus? Sounded to me from the video it was the daughter caught lying. If children doesn't want to respect their parents they can always move put. Until then they should
1313480773173944322 2020-10-06 22:06:34 +0800 <JobTrendr> @Thereal_kj1983 @AMinorGod @GarmentsKings @rachelivey @KellyannePolls We know both are transmitted unintentionally. The debate was about her intentionally giving her child a virus which is BS! Feel free to wear your mask, unless they are n95 they don't work anyway
1313478359834415105 2020-10-06 21:56:58 +0800 <JobTrendr> @AMinorGod It was her mother who said ”you lied about me” and her daughter who said ”I THOUGHT” the keyword is ”thought” she lied and her mother was p!ssed as she should be. Lastly this shouldn't be on social media. This is personal family issues and that alone is disrespectful
1313477492544606211 2020-10-06 21:53:32 +0800 <JobTrendr> @AMinorGod I never said your children cant ask you questions. I said they shouldn't disrespect their parents. Secretly recording her mother was disrespectful. her mother doesn't have to tell her if she's sick. Lastly we're are you getting she lied to her and intentionally have her a virus
1313476880276819969 2020-10-06 21:51:06 +0800 <JobTrendr> @AMinorGod @GarmentsKings @rachelivey @KellyannePolls Respect is given while living in your parents home. If I'm sick I don't have to tell my children. You saying it was given on purpose is a joke. So now anytime a liberal gives their children the flu virus I expect you to come out and say they are abusive
1313476365472206851 2020-10-06 21:49:03 +0800 <JobTrendr> @AMinorGod @GarmentsKings @rachelivey @KellyannePolls Kids don't develop rational thought at her age! Science has already proven that and that's why we have a 2 system legal framework. One for children and one for adults. Lastly she wasn't given Rona intentionally by her mother. For you to say that is unbelievable.
1313475627123646464 2020-10-06 21:46:07 +0800 <JobTrendr> @AMinorGod @GarmentsKings @rachelivey @KellyannePolls I was pointing out my mother respected her mother whole going through a very bad situation while this girl has a good life. Tell me how they are abusing her? While you are living under mom and dad's roof you should respect them! As i said if she was my child respect be given

At what age should children have the right to disrespect their parents? The Conway’s aren't abusing their daughter so please don't go there. There is 0 excuse for her to behave like this toward her parents

My mother lived behind a garbage dump, received a 1 can of vegetables to feed 4 sisters, and never had eaten meat until she met my father but still respected her mother. There isn't an excuse to behave the way she is. Her parents treat her well

He killed a Trump supporter and said he was defending his brothers )Antifa/BLM) from possible future harm. He was 💯% democrat voter.

I don’t think democrats have much ledge to stand on when they’ve spent months taking over parts of cities and Firebombing police stations!

I can list many more from Antifa and BLM then you can Trump supporters

It's that simple. The laws leading up to this I think we can agree on. These laws were designed to stop drug dealers from flushing the drugs. I'm actually against the way we have done the drug wars.

You can’t deescalate from that. The second someone opened fired and an officer went down shots would be returned. You’re a typical back bencher telling ppl what they should do.

1311782579914366977 2020-10-02 05:38:33 +0800 <JobTrendr> @night_harbinger @tprilliman35 @Cycle_Badger @OridiusMorphius @TomiLahren Nope. They knocked and also announced per a witness. Furthermore the person in the bed has time to go get his gun, get in position, and shoot. I don't think the police were outside sneaking around and he heard something thinking ”i hear an intruder” when police breach they scream
1311781934071263232 2020-10-02 05:35:59 +0800 <JobTrendr> @night_harbinger @tprilliman35 @Cycle_Badger @OridiusMorphius @TomiLahren I agree. I’m not a Fan of no knock warrants or getting a warrant on CI information. We agree. That doesn’t change the fact the police were acting within the laws passed by leaders in their locality. They did nothing wrong

They love America and there is t anything wrong with that. They have used violence when confronting  BLM/Antifa because those groups are torching cities. They are the radical groups! Why won’t Biden denounce them?

Wallace asked him to denounce white supremacy! Biden brought up the proud boys and they are not a racist group! They are a nationalist group. Big difference my friend! The proud boys chairman is a black Latino. Racist groups don’t let people of color join or lead

As much as Trump has done for service members and as little as Biden has done speaks volumes. Biden actually called military men and women dumb basta&amp;rds on camera. How can a cop vote democrat? Democrats hate police

They don’t seem to be very good racists if you ask me
1311740746068885510 2020-10-02 02:52:19 +0800 <JobTrendr> Then Lindsey is getting talking points from the dem party. how many times does the president need to say he condemns white supremacy before ppl like Roberts stop asking for another declaration. He denounced racist many times. Isn’t that enough John?   https://t.co/XO8T2Roc4S

They have Latinos and blacks in the group. Their chairman is Enrique Tarrio who is a black Cuban. They are a nationalist group who return violence against Antifa and BLM who burn sh!t down

Being patriotic of your country does not make you racist! As for the KKK it was trump who designated them a terrorist group! Biden had 47 yrs to do that and didn’t! Why? Because the democrat party has always been loaded up with KKK politicians
1311331592468598791 2020-09-30 23:46:29 +0800 <JobTrendr> @SenatorTimScott What do you think the police should have been charged with? One police officer was shot and they returned fire. They also were serving a legal no knock warrant and actually knocked. I think most Americans feel horrible about Ms. Taylor but not sure how the police acted wrongly

There wipxne a lawsuit and the school and police dept will lose. These ppl we're outside and distances for gods sake.. Is this what we are know? How can anyone defend this?
1309641360522256384 2020-09-26 07:50:06 +0800 <JobTrendr> @andrewkimmel @DineshDSouza she should have followed direction when told she was under arrest. Then sued the school and city. Now for her fighting, it will be a resisting charge. You can't arrest ppl for not wearing a mask outdoors many feet away from others. If you could all the protestors would be jailed

I used to be a peace officer in Arizona and nobody woke up thinking ”lets hurt a POC today”! The job is hard and pay weak. Most of these horrible homicides the person was fighting with police or had a weapon. Briana was horribly shot but boyfriend shot first

1308936594121011200 2020-09-24 09:09:37 +0800 <JobTrendr> @jfreewright Why didn't they charge the boyfriend for wanton disregard of human life? He should have been charged with manslaughter for causing her death! He opened fire on police serving a warrant, he shot a cop, they returned fire. Myhw they should have shot 1 time. I guess that would fixit
1308935514700034050 2020-09-24 09:05:20 +0800 <JobTrendr> @samanthareichle @violadavis Because he was returning fire! An officer was shot by a person on the house! In a hallway! Charge the fit who opened fore on police! He caused the death! Why wasn't he charged with wanton disregard for life just like the officer? Total BS

It’s the context that you do it. Saying it’s wrong/sinful is actually the right thing to do. That’s in scripture. The Bible is loaded with examples. If you’re not a Christian you may want to stay in your lane
1308593839641419776 2020-09-23 10:27:38 +0800 <JobTrendr> @Michele67835135 @ZupancicJareen @joemala_2020 @cindymccain @carlquintanilla @JoeBiden Apparently you aren’t much a a Christian! Please stop with acting as you know scripture! John 7 Matthew 18:15-20 Rom 1; Gal 5:19 Heb 12:14 Heb 12:15 Tons of scripture in defense of pointing out sin! Righteous judgement isn’t a sin and reinforced by scripture
1308590548979200002 2020-09-23 10:14:33 +0800 <JobTrendr> @cindymccain @JoeBiden Yep let’s put democrats in power so they can kill more unborn children, pack scotus, continue attacking religious freedoms, and restrict the 3nd amend! Sounds like real conservative principles you have! Your hatred is foremost over patriotism! Oh and John was a warmonger

Your arguing a point we agree on and a very small percentage of abortions. So let’s both agree to allow abortion when a woman may die and not for any other reason👍

If your physical life is in danger that’s different. If you don’t want the child give it up for adoption. You do not have to raise the child if you feel it will stop you from partying ect...
1308205087735586816 2020-09-22 08:42:52 +0800 <JobTrendr> @NeuronesFiring @TomjHiden @SarahJKS77 @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump Their choice has an impact on killing an unborn baby! I have no problem with a woman forcing a man to have a vasectomy if he wants to have sex with her
1308204698344792064 2020-09-22 08:41:20 +0800 <JobTrendr> @NeuronesFiring @SarahJKS77 @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump Being able to get pregnant is irrelevant to taking a position on the life of an innocent unborn baby! There are risks to everything we do in life. We don’t get to kill someone when we misjudged our risk! There is always adoption for anyone who doesn’t want to keep the child.

There is only 2 sex (M and F) and your born one or the other. that’s what I teach my sons! I also teach them sexual acts with the same gender is a sin within our religious beliefs!! I also teach them to respect everyone

If a guy doesn’t want to have one or wear a condom and the woman doesn’t want to take the pill or force him to wear a condom or have the operation then BOTH should suck it up and be responsible! A child shouldn’t be killed for a woman and MAN IRRESPONSIBILITY

Lastly I don’t think anyone needs someone to tell them what to do or accept in a relationship. If you need that u shouldn’t be in 1
1308074636178059264 2020-09-22 00:04:30 +0800 <JobTrendr> @LunaSeesU @SarahJKS77 @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump Yep I agree! I never said the contrary

She has the right to request that and the man has a right to refuse and miss out of having sex with her. Win win

Manslaughter? Or just assault on the woman only? Your position is hypocritical on a legal basis and saying the first breath somehow makes a unborn baby alive is insane
1307726125225869316 2020-09-21 00:59:39 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DejeanEndoMD @SarahJKS77 @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump Why restrict after the second trimester? If it’s not life and just an organism until it actually takes its first breath? Your last comment is misleading as I am opposed to abortion after second trimester. I’m actually in your most Americans group but don’t agree with abortion
1307725575180767233 2020-09-21 00:57:28 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DejeanEndoMD @SarahJKS77 @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump So I just want to be clear. What you are saying is a 8 month unborn baby is actually just an organism? What you are also saying is a person has to physically draw breath to be considered life? So a baby has to draw breath to be life regardless of development phase. Ur a doctor?
1307724676320374786 2020-09-21 00:53:53 +0800 <JobTrendr> @butterflynma @SarahJKS77 @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump I’m not a right winger.I don’t approve of either party. I think they both have done tremendous damage to America. What I also think is left wingers are far more dangerous. They act silly want more government intervention which is totally insane. I’ve seen how that plays out

If not can you explain when a baby becomes a baby? That really is the question isn’t it? if a drunk driving kills a pregnant woman and unborn baby they’re charged with double murder.. how is that possible if it not a baby
1307675038880067584 2020-09-20 21:36:39 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DejeanEndoMD @SarahJKS77 @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump We both agree Abortion is dangerous and should be regulated. Where I think we disagree is I think it shouldn’t be allowed unless the mothers life is in danger and you want abortion on demand. Democrats are fighting states that want abortion clinics to have admin rights. Youagree?

Democrats would fill the seat! And lastly the lives of unborn children are far more important than your hate for orange man bad! Ppl like you don’t care about unborn babies
1307669025439313920 2020-09-20 21:12:45 +0800 <JobTrendr> @HKrassenstein Lastly at the same time in2016 the Democrats were saying the GOP was wrong and filling the seat was the correct thing to do. RBG also said the seat should be filled.  Raise your hands if Democrats are hypocrites
1307668661579194368 2020-09-20 21:11:18 +0800 <JobTrendr> @HKrassenstein Only if different parties control the WH and Senate. Thanks for playing

It’s easy to fix. You don’t get to make a decision to have sex and take no responsibility. After all it’s her body as all liberals say.

It actually says in the article women may choose a doctor that isn’t experienced in doing abortions. They also talk about post damage after abortions. You just proved abortions are very dangerous and need more regulation  https://t.co/D40z4shRB5

I don’t disagree. The part we have disagreement is the responsibility part.. the question isn’t if education will slow abortion, it’s if an unborn baby is a baby Take care

1307646987106426880 2020-09-20 19:45:11 +0800 <JobTrendr> @AliVelshi @realDonaldTrump If it was “entirely peaceful” police wouldn’t have used non lethal force. So I agree it was law and order and it WAS a beautiful thing to see..

1307536667474001926 2020-09-20 12:26:49 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DejeanEndoMD @SarahJKS77 @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump Abortion is big business is America and democrats are teaching young girls there is nothing wrong with having one.. this leads young boys to say “just go have an abortion” responsibility is removed from the act. This is horrible for a society.
1307535956258492417 2020-09-20 12:23:59 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DejeanEndoMD @SarahJKS77 @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump I agree with you 💯 %. I have no problem with educating ppl on other options than abortion. My problem is with the excuses used to promote abortion. It is a baby and we should never make wrong things legal because ppl will do it anyway. Abortion has become a rally cry for dems
1307535032106577921 2020-09-20 12:20:19 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DejeanEndoMD @SarahJKS77 @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump So you’re not denying an unborn baby is an actual baby? Your whole argument is “ppl gonna do it anyway so let’s make it as safe as possible for the person doing the killing”! I’ve lived in many countries with abortion not allowed and didn’t see a mass of women dying from hangers
1307533792182251522 2020-09-20 12:15:23 +0800 <JobTrendr> @SarahJKS77 @DejeanEndoMD @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump Nor can a 1 month old delivered baby, nor can a person in a coma!! The fact is babies as young as 23 weeks can live if delivered. With technology the age keeps decreasing. It’s not a clump of cells it’s a living being. Is a 9 month old 1 hour before delivery a clump of cells
1307532648886267904 2020-09-20 12:10:50 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DejeanEndoMD @SarahJKS77 @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump Education is irrelevant when you remove responsibility!! As for my religious views I have no problem debating you on them. First: killing unborn children is wrong. I assume you agree an unborn baby is a baby? Secondly religion is flooded with consequences for disobedience Gnight
1307531241202343936 2020-09-20 12:05:15 +0800 <JobTrendr> @SarahJKS77 @butterflynma @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump Nope I don’t have a problem with a woman telling a man “get a vasectomy if you want to have sex with me” I really wish you loony libs would start asking your men to do that.

1307466731980500992 2020-09-20 07:48:55 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DejeanEndoMD @SarahJKS77 @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump There's ur ”lets educate them”  American society you have ppl wearing ”i just got an abortion” tee shirts as a badge of honor.. I worked/lived all over Africa, Asia, Europe, and Central South America and have never seen this utilization of killing babies. Education won't work
1307465875264544769 2020-09-20 07:45:30 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DejeanEndoMD @SarahJKS77 @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump Your argument was education will slow and/or stop abortion correct? my point is If that's the case why make anything illegal? Let's just school the population up! The fact is an unborn baby is still a baby. Going through a 6-inch birth canal doesn't magically make it one.
1307464780291149824 2020-09-20 07:41:09 +0800 <JobTrendr> @SarahJKS77 @DejeanEndoMD @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump Nope, that's not what in assuming. I'm not never abortion. If a woman's life is in danger that's different. If a women what's to kill a baby because it's stops her from going to parties that's a problem. Men are no better. Both mem and women should Nut up and take responsibility
1307464105327038464 2020-09-20 07:38:28 +0800 <JobTrendr> @SenatorCollins So if you vote down a Trump nominee the ppl who will be voting for you won't vote for you. Republican voters want rue position filled. Democrats would so the same if they could.. Go ahead and vote a nominee down and let a democrat take your seat.

I believe abortion should be a choice if mother's life is in danger so by all the polls I fall under pro-abortion. I am 100 percent ANTI ABORTION. word semantics is all you're playing.

That means you have a hard time making good decisions or Maybe the men you were with just wanted sex? There are women who just want sex also. Pick someone else. Also why would married ppl need an abortion? Because they don't want a baby?
1307404202646417409 2020-09-20 03:40:26 +0800 <JobTrendr> @AtWhatIsWrong @SarahJKS77 @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump So what ur really saying: Women use sex to keep men who just want sex from the woman? let me be very clear with your comment ”we should raise men to be etc..” I raised my daughter to respect herself and respect the right she has to say no. You can't say ”i was talked into it”

So you're telling me a 23-week old unborn baby is ”just a clump of cells”? How about an unborn 8-month-old? Just a clump of cells” what a ridiculous leftwing talking point  and you say I need to be educated bwah ahahsh

After all the numbers will drop if we just spend a little time educating them!!! What a joke! And you are an MD? Either an unborn child is a child that's unborn OR it isn't! If u are a doctor you know better

I guess it will be a huge win for Dems if GOP leaders like @lisamurkowski refuse to support a new nominee. 1. They will lose GOP voters that voted for them in past 2. Dems will still vote against them 3. SCOTUS won't have a tiebreak vote when election is contested

What I care about is what a woman does to other future women and men's bodies! I had a granddaughter born at 23 weeks. I held her hand while in NICU. You will never be able to say she wasn't a baby

Both men and women need to accept responsibility for their actions! Killing an unborn child for the sole reason it's an inconvenience is evil as h€ll

The GOP voters decide her fate want the vacancy filled. The Dems will be voting against her regardless. She will gain nothing from bending to liberal demands. If she refuses she will lose support from the ppl who would be voting for her

You must comply when the officer says your under arrest. You do have the right to challenge said arrest in court not by resisting arrest in the street
1305619383541264385 2020-09-15 05:28:12 +0800 <JobTrendr> @josie_huang @LASDHQ Yep you were clearly pulling away from the officers(resisting arrest)! Glad you posted this tape. Cops cleared. Another anarchist hiding behind a media badge off the streets. You screaming for other reporters to witness arrest shows you want to be the story not report stories
1305618307861622785 2020-09-15 05:23:56 +0800 <JobTrendr> @josie_huang @LASDHQ Total BS lady! You were within feet of the officers when they were making an arrest. Secondly you were screaming ouch when they were saying back up! You remind me of the soccer player who falls down when someone gets close in an attempt to say foul!

That makes little sense if they are voting twice lastly they have sent 100 as of now for prosecution. So yeah they are charging them
1305258840913571840 2020-09-14 05:35:32 +0800 <JobTrendr> @BoomstickFTTW @JonathonSnyder @birdermaria @TwitterSafety The difference is as polarized as rue country is one state can make a difference. That and the fact there is already an issue with ppl committing fraud. The Georgia issue and the GOP trying to rob an election last year. Now ppl like you say ”nothing to see here”total bath!t crazy
1305257809542557698 2020-09-14 05:31:26 +0800 <JobTrendr> @EricaKiou6 Added you👍 thank you for what you did. Very brave especially in California

Yep you seem to have that all figured out. Lord God ppl! And I have to share this wonderful equal opportunity country with ppl like this.
1305224834155253761 2020-09-14 03:20:25 +0800 <JobTrendr> @BoomstickFTTW @JonathonSnyder @birdermaria @TwitterSafety No it isn't you just acknowledged Can and Nv are doing exactly what I said. Your argument? ”its only 2 states” unbelievable

You'd have to be a partisan or lunatic not to acknowledge that. Also do you think if Biden loses the dems won't scream rigged election? Heck the dems haven't got over the last election loss.
1305209698707275777 2020-09-14 02:20:16 +0800 <JobTrendr> @BoomstickFTTW @JonathonSnyder @birdermaria @TwitterSafety Again a process that's been set up. Democrats just throwing millions of ballots in the mail (Can and Nv and others to follow) is insane. Its going to lead to more mistrust in the system. Request a absentee ballot, go to poll directly, or don't vote.  No mass balloting
1305209228936830979 2020-09-14 02:18:24 +0800 <JobTrendr> @BoomstickFTTW @JonathonSnyder @birdermaria @TwitterSafety Nevada can change the outcome of the election so it is a big deal. There isn't evidence on mass ballot fraud because sending mass ballots hasn't happened before. There has always been a process, not just taking last election voter roll and sending ballots. 1000 in ga just charged
1305208725553152000 2020-09-14 02:16:24 +0800 <JobTrendr> @BoomstickFTTW @JonathonSnyder @birdermaria @TwitterSafety this is not true! Yes you can apply for an absentee ballot but states don't mass mail ballots not knowing if ppl still live at the address. As for the typical ”no evidence” 1000 ppl in Ga are being charged with voter fraud and NC just had voter fraud with the GOP. This is insane
1305203379015217154 2020-09-14 01:55:09 +0800 <JobTrendr> @BoomstickFTTW @JonathonSnyder @birdermaria @TwitterSafety I wonder if ppl like to actually do any research or just spew CNN? Why be dishonest? You said ”they don't just send ballots to every registered voters” actually that's not true! California and Nevada, have sent actual mail-in ballots to all registered voters in their states.
1305174906947149824 2020-09-14 00:02:01 +0800 <JobTrendr> @BoomstickFTTW @JonathonSnyder @birdermaria @TwitterSafety Yea and the ppl doing the checking will use their discretion. Are these ppl experts in signature matching? With absentee ballots it's the person living in the home requesting the ballot. Less likely fraud

If I'm wrong explain with facts

Nor will I agree with ppl like you for fear of being called a racist! If someone gets shot by police I look at what happened and base a decision on the facts. I don't look at a persons color like you! What you are doing is basing your opinion on color

As long as you can push a fake narrative. He was a rapist who fought with police and had a deadly weapon in his car!!!! who cares about his color!!! He Got what he deserved

My immediate family is here on a green card, we speak Spanish in our home, and I come from a mixed home. We were taught to never play victim and respect the police. U cant change the fact Blake was a violent rapist.
1304886436991299597 2020-09-13 04:55:44 +0800 <JobTrendr> @T1cowboy @MAGAKatydid @Breaking911 @KamalaHarris @Scotus I'm far from liberal and far from conservative. I would expect nothing less than you thinking I was racist for defending police who shoot a violent rapist who fought with them. It shows how lawless you like things. I don't believe MOST black ppl agree with you.
1304885966298058757 2020-09-13 04:53:52 +0800 <JobTrendr> @T1cowboy @MAGAKatydid @Breaking911 @KamalaHarris @Scotus the Dem and GOP parties have done horrible damage. I'm not registered GOP and have always been a swing voter. In past I've voted Democrat but will never vote Dem again. The injustices in the past were a result of both parties. I do believe there are some good ppl on both sides

The crime bill wasn't fair. Thank Biden for destroying black families and Trump for fixing it. We are talking about getting shot by police. What happened to Blake was justified. Others I would agree with you
1304884459615989761 2020-09-13 04:47:53 +0800 <JobTrendr> @T1cowboy @MAGAKatydid @Breaking911 @KamalaHarris @Scotus Lastly I will say historically the system hasn't been fair to black Americans. The crime bill passed years ago by Biden and crew WAS HORRIFIC. USA is not perfect but find one who is. My point is in 2020 everyone has a fair chance. Getting shot for fighting police isn't racist
1304883342404456448 2020-09-13 04:43:27 +0800 <JobTrendr> @T1cowboy @MAGAKatydid @Breaking911 @KamalaHarris @Scotus Yea don't try the racist card it doesn't work on me. I'm saying 6% of the black population commit over half of all violent crime. That's a fact. It's not racist to point out fact. Out of the 6% (black men) it's only a small few that commit the crime. That leaves 99% good blac ppl

I like police around. It stops criminal acts

1304390267873746944 2020-09-11 20:04:08 +0800 <JobTrendr> @RuthMott5 @PolitiBunny Yea because COVID can distinguish between rally and activism! By the way, a rally is activism. Lastly, the protested aren't peaceful and 96% of the protesters were violent because any peaceful protestors would have left when ppl started burning stuff down u ppl are something else

If A cop is killed by a criminal it’s “that’s what they signed up for” just like loggers, police have tools to protect them from hazards of the job. It should be expected for them to save their lives as anyone else would
1304202318099943424 2020-09-11 07:37:18 +0800 <JobTrendr> @T1cowboy @MAGAKatydid @Breaking911 @KamalaHarris @Scotus I agree One life is one to many! You have to look at both sides though. during the past 10 years, an average of one cop killed every 54 hours or 163 per year. There were 135 law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty in 2019. When you fight with police bad things happen

If you’re going to debate someone at the minimum study up! Posting your Trashy video licking the crack of another woman’s  A$$ doesn’t make you a winner in political arguments
1304108450419486721 2020-09-11 01:24:18 +0800 <JobTrendr> @tariqnasheed Awwwww Tariq and the Democrats are losing their grip on the black population!
1304100966279544833 2020-09-11 00:54:34 +0800 <JobTrendr> @T1cowboy @MAGAKatydid @Breaking911 @KamalaHarris I’d be ok with that. I served myself and know if you fight with SP/MP you’ll get your noggin cracked. It also means criminals will be judged at tribunal which is better. No bond which is better! Sign me up

1303875853189865472 2020-09-10 10:00:02 +0800 <JobTrendr> @T1cowboy @MAGAKatydid @Breaking911 @KamalaHarris Until you are violent and a threat to the public. Again the constitution and interpretation by Scotus is clear. You don’t have a leg to stand on. Ppl committing violent crimes and fighting with police will result is deadly force being used. Cops have a few seconds to respond
1303875292969275392 2020-09-10 09:57:49 +0800 <JobTrendr> @T1cowboy @MAGAKatydid @Breaking911 @KamalaHarris What had said had nothing to do with what you it’s said. You should like a child. Respond to what I said. It’s a class thing not a color thing. Lastly you can lose your right to live when you are violent and a danger to society
1303874725861564416 2020-09-10 09:55:34 +0800 <JobTrendr> @T1cowboy @MAGAKatydid @Breaking911 @KamalaHarris @Scotus What I said was protected by scotus and therefore not a violation of the constitution. You keep talking about incarceration and I don’t understand why? I agree with u about incarceration! We are discussing use of force by police. What happened to Blake was not a violation.
1303814154394972160 2020-09-10 05:54:52 +0800 <JobTrendr> @AriKrauss It’s not difficult to win! Just look at Obama! Did nothing and won😂🤣
1303813439077445633 2020-09-10 05:52:02 +0800 <JobTrendr> @T1cowboy @MAGAKatydid @Breaking911 @KamalaHarris And your “America is racist” “cops want to kill blacks” is definitely not rooted in reality  Hence “I’m a victim”
1303813207962902544 2020-09-10 05:51:07 +0800 <JobTrendr> @T1cowboy @MAGAKatydid @Breaking911 @KamalaHarris I think every cop being a human can have bias. I don’t think it’s even close to systemic though. I think if it were someone famous of any color they would most likely have an advantage. Look at OJ. James Brown tried to run over cops and lived. It’s class not race
1303811688085565440 2020-09-10 05:45:04 +0800 <JobTrendr> @T1cowboy @MAGAKatydid @Breaking911 @KamalaHarris Nope @Scotus has been consistent “reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, and an allowance for the fact that police are forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force necessary.”
1303809880990547973 2020-09-10 05:37:53 +0800 <JobTrendr> @T1cowboy @MAGAKatydid @Breaking911 @KamalaHarris First off he was arrested for Assault. Secondly the charges were dropped as no witnesses or evidence it happened. Lastly if Hank or any other famous person acted like Blake (fighting police, tased, went into car with knife) I would say the same thing. I don’t care who u are
1303809084295086088 2020-09-10 05:34:43 +0800 <JobTrendr> @T1cowboy @MAGAKatydid @Breaking911 @KamalaHarris Not from me. I don’t care who you are. If you act like Blake did so be it
1303808067386200067 2020-09-10 05:30:41 +0800 <JobTrendr> @T1cowboy @MAGAKatydid @Breaking911 @KamalaHarris Think of those 3 things and implement them in 2 seconds. You ppl are crazy. I’ve been a peace officer and 99.9% doesn’t want to use deadly force. When you have ppl like Blake sometimes it’s unavoidable
1303807438563561474 2020-09-10 05:28:11 +0800 <JobTrendr> @T1cowboy @MAGAKatydid @Breaking911 @KamalaHarris I think Sammy Davis did a few things illegal as well! I didn’t cancel him nor do I cancel Blake. I’m saying if you fight with police and non lethal force doesn’t work and you have a weapon in reach and you were under arrest for felony rape you may get shot. It really is that easy
1303771450587873280 2020-09-10 03:05:11 +0800 <JobTrendr> @T1cowboy @MAGAKatydid @Breaking911 @KamalaHarris Actually police have a right to defend themselves with deadly force if they have a reasonable feeling they can be killed. Blake was shot under what I think most rational ppl would feel.
1303771129497235471 2020-09-10 03:03:54 +0800 <JobTrendr> @T1cowboy @MAGAKatydid @Breaking911 @KamalaHarris I agree with you on most of your comment. The specific difference with Blake is the police didn’t have surveillance on him. They were called by a minority woman who was assaulted by Blake. Then he fought with police.
1303770623966171136 2020-09-10 03:01:54 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DamnSheame @eugenegu @megynkelly It became irrelevant when he fought with police, opened his car door, and had a deadly weapon inside! It will be considered justifiable as police don’t have to wait until they get stabbed or shot to use deadly force.

1303735849377583104 2020-09-10 00:43:43 +0800 <JobTrendr> @TheRealHoarse @Benj_ier Biden is a huge warmonger like most politicians on both sides! When trump removed a mere 40 soldiers from the Middle East looked how both sides reacted! None of them want our troops home
1303734788503855104 2020-09-10 00:39:30 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ReallyAmerican1 Yes Trump knew and it was his job to keep America calm! Just like fauchi did when he said masks won’t help. U ppl are a joke
1303733967238111234 2020-09-10 00:36:14 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DamnSheame @eugenegu @megynkelly Irrelevant when he told them as the knife was in car. If a police officer reasonably believes his life is in danger its lights out for ya. Blake reaching into car after fighting with police and knife in car it’s over. Irrelevant as to what was said a deadly weapon was in the car
1303732860566876160 2020-09-10 00:31:50 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ihatefishing1 @eugenegu @megynkelly Ok he was charged with sexual assault and violence on a family member. To be factual he placed his fingers inside a woman, pulled them out, smelled them, and said “smells like you’ve been with another man” And @KamalaHarris says she’s proud of him!!! U can’t make this up ppl
1303502283498500098 2020-09-09 09:15:36 +0800 <JobTrendr> Yep  https://t.co/hcKjj5xM2D
1303502235461185536 2020-09-09 09:15:25 +0800 <JobTrendr> Yep  https://t.co/0bKHNVo9A4
1303499788252577796 2020-09-09 09:05:42 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DamnSheame @eugenegu @megynkelly Nope! That’s not why he was there. You need to worry less about my grammar and more about your lack of information! Next time you want to debate facts Do a little more research
1303499105407295493 2020-09-09 09:02:59 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DamnSheame @eugenegu @megynkelly You could hear the cop saying drop the knife!  he admitted to having a knife. That in conjunction with fighting police and non lethal force not working while attempting to arrest him for felony rape makes it justifiable.  https://t.co/XzuFmTHwhp

1303398681899667461 2020-09-09 02:23:56 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DamnSheame @eugenegu @megynkelly Hey buddy he had felony warrants for violent crimes!! He don’t get the right to leave when he wants to! you will see they won’t be charged as it wasn’t excessive! You don’t fight with police while having a felony warrant and reach into a car! Blake already always he had the knife

1303394912189251585 2020-09-09 02:08:57 +0800 <JobTrendr> @pablo_honey1 @megynkelly Has he fought with police and tried to go for a knife? Did any of trump accusers come out while he was a democrat?
1303394660258402304 2020-09-09 02:07:57 +0800 <JobTrendr> @mmpadellan Trump was not physically fighting with police, tased several times, and went for a knife in his car! Nor did any woman accuse Trump until he quit being a democrat
1303394012460654592 2020-09-09 02:05:23 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DamnSheame @eugenegu @megynkelly Not excessive force for sure. No way it was excessive I will agree it’s hard to believe he would make the actions he did
1303389698472251394 2020-09-09 01:48:14 +0800 <JobTrendr> @adriastouch @TheView No it’s not the same thing! BLM and Antifa are burning down cities! It’s not a minority of the protestors! Protestors aren’t going to be there when ppl are throwing Molotov cocktails at police! Throwing quick dry cement on police doors then setting the building aflame
1303386213630570500 2020-09-09 01:34:23 +0800 <JobTrendr> @BFriedmanDC @votevets Your point? Mr. Crowley doesn’t know what trump said! The 10 ppl including Trump hating Bolton said it was a lie. Keep spinning those wheels though

Regardless of age is he charged with felony SEXUAL ASSAULT? Can’t say it can you? It just breaks that little liberal heart doesn’t it? Destroys that ignorant narrative u ppl are pushing
1303384636513546252 2020-09-09 01:28:07 +0800 <JobTrendr> @VandenbergShawn @MrOlmos @ByMikeBaker @ChrisCuomo @donlemon @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @foxandfriends @maddow @MSNBC @CNN @FoxNewsSunday Everyone gets out without bail now! Where have you been?
1303383629717024769 2020-09-09 01:24:07 +0800 <JobTrendr> @MrOlmos Naked in public and you’re worried about him being maxed? The dude should be in jail for running around the streets naked
1303382529039314946 2020-09-09 01:19:45 +0800 <JobTrendr> @MrOlmos At least they followed instructions from police! If it were BLM and Antifa they would have started throwing bottles filled with quick dry cement
1303382252286550017 2020-09-09 01:18:39 +0800 <JobTrendr> @MrOlmos What did the woman say before macing him? “I told you I would get you for everything you did to me b!tch” and the response from the #antifa member? “I’m sorry” I think there may be more to this story that you are pushing out
1303368233798467584 2020-09-09 00:22:57 +0800 <JobTrendr> @RealityBabbler Best u got?

The most violent areas in America are controlled by Democrats! Sorry but state gov doesn’t run the democrat controlled liberal cities! Can’t blame the governor for mistake mayor Ted wheeler did! This applies to all states Thanks for playing
1303367145645015040 2020-09-09 00:18:37 +0800 <JobTrendr> @flwersrpretty @eugenegu @megynkelly I’m sorry can you please tell me if he was charged with rape? And beating his companion! Sexual assault is rape. Was he charged with sexual assault on any woman? Where did the @MeTooMVMT go with liberals! First Biden and Blake and you ppl defend them. Shame
1303365088154464257 2020-09-09 00:10:27 +0800 <JobTrendr> @T1cowboy @MAGAKatydid @Breaking911 @KamalaHarris Listen I have nothing against Blake! I’m not judging him as a person IM judging the actions he took and the result! This shooting will be considered a justifiable shooting. Shot in the back once or 7 times will be considered irrelevant when they look at Blake’s actions
1303364411948752896 2020-09-09 00:07:45 +0800 <JobTrendr> @DamnSheame @eugenegu @megynkelly Justifiably shot! They are not required to wait for a person to turn and stab/shoot them! There won’t be a judge. This isn’t going anywhere. You can take that check to the bank and cash it
1303364021706534912 2020-09-09 00:06:12 +0800 <JobTrendr> @bryonworks @mmpadellan Harris and Biden are 2 of the most responsible for locking up black men! You’re a joke
1303363574174277633 2020-09-09 00:04:26 +0800 <JobTrendr> @mmpadellan Yep and all the violence in democrat controlled cities in the red state that the state government don’t control. Newsflash-cities are controlled by local leaders
1303363289590759427 2020-09-09 00:03:18 +0800 <JobTrendr> @mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump Lier ☝️
1303358992220127232 2020-09-08 23:46:13 +0800 <JobTrendr> @Khanoisseur Blake shot for fighting with police and reaching into a car with a knife in the front seat. Blake has already admitted he had the knife! Sorry but police lives matter too! They have a few seconds to react and have a right to protect themselves with loons like Blake
1303358380036292617 2020-09-08 23:43:47 +0800 <JobTrendr> @Lily_Warrior @megynkelly Sorry but can you explain what he was reaching for inside his car? You think the police should wait to be stabbed? Wait for him to turn around with the knife before firing? Someone known for violence, tased 2 times, and still went for the front seat of his car! Nope 👎
1303357951395143687 2020-09-08 23:42:05 +0800 <JobTrendr> @nellebynature @megynkelly He was shot for reaching into his car where he had a knife in the front seat, after fighting with police and tased 2 times! Non lethal force didn’t work. Lastly they were trying to arrest him for FELONY warrants! domestic violence and Sex assault of a child! Minority victims
1303357163331563520 2020-09-08 23:38:57 +0800 <JobTrendr> @LeeNME12 There were minority victims who called the police on Blake! Domestic violence and sexual assault of a child! He was shot for not only having felony warrants but fighting with police and having a knife in his car(which he reached in for). And this is the hill you want to d!e on?
1303356742223441920 2020-09-08 23:37:17 +0800 <JobTrendr> @eugenegu @megynkelly Black woman accused him of domestic violence and sexual assault of a child was not white. These are minority victims! This is the white boogeyman who made this all up. The fighting of police and the knife in the car is indisputable! Watch the video Mr. fake Dr
1303356339364782082 2020-09-08 23:35:41 +0800 <JobTrendr> @eugenegu @megynkelly ford waited 40 yrs just as he was selected for scotus, all her witnesses said it was a lie, then others came forward and had to recant! Blake was actually charged with sexual assault of a child!!! Not a white child! The women who accused him came out immediately and was black

1302694022360764419 2020-09-07 03:43:52 +0800 <JobTrendr> @yung_afr0dite @JamesTharp10 @GoSuMonSteR @kimleannelliot @dannagal @jasonintrator it's liberals using fascist tactics! Just for disagreeing with a liberals gets you jackboots coming after you! They burn your businesses, homes, communities, they try to get you canceled! They are fascists. I'm not a GOP! Never have been. I've voted dem in the past. Never again
1302657095033147393 2020-09-07 01:17:08 +0800 <JobTrendr> @emmyrossum And every time I see you In a movie I taste a slight tinge of vomit in my mouth! You liberal movie ppl are destroying your image with half of America as much as James Woods is with the other half!
1302656039704240128 2020-09-07 01:12:56 +0800 <JobTrendr> @fredxtv @jihadwatchRS Well I've actually followed Robert and Pam Geller’s work for a long time and not knowing much about Richard other than the anti-semantic comments I think I just put down the wrong name on familiarity

Ppl on the right want small decentralized gov! They don't want cradle to grave government. That's what liberals want! Same as nazis
1302644974618640384 2020-09-07 00:28:58 +0800 <JobTrendr> @GoSuMonSteR @JamesTharp10 @kimleannelliot @dannagal @jasonintrator Yea well contrary to a changed nutritive Nazis were one of the worst terror organizations and they were socialists not on the right as ppl like you claim. Their ideology/platform was perfectly in line with our now liberal/dem platform

The first amend is there to protect against other ppl saying “you can’t say that because it hurts my feelings” where in the heck did you get a degree! Give it back! You clearly have low IQ and lacking on common sense
1302608154501541890 2020-09-06 22:02:39 +0800 <JobTrendr> @dannagal 1619 project is total false propaganda and critical race theory is another attempt into indoctrination of children in a public school that everyone pays taxes for! Just the word theory in its name is enough to trash this trash

1301118139179163648 2020-09-02 19:21:52 +0800 <JobTrendr> @ChrisCuomo Blocking the road so ppl will stop so they can drag them out of the truck so they can beat them up! Yes Chris That big @Ford is the strength we need
1301098103739736065 2020-09-02 18:02:15 +0800 <JobTrendr> @gatewaypundit @cristinalaila1 Cohen got another one!
1300979438046326790 2020-09-02 10:10:43 +0800 <JobTrendr> @KamalaHarris Good attempt! Thanks for playing
1300976919589072898 2020-09-02 10:00:43 +0800 <JobTrendr> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump Nope
1300976469045317635 2020-09-02 09:58:55 +0800 <JobTrendr> @MissNess8o8 @McKaylaRoseJ @JoeBiden @CNN I never said their past was a reason to kill them. their actions caused the end result. I personally was pointing out all of them were criminals and at lest one of them was charged for molesting. The one who shot them never had a criminal record and went strait to the police
1300930400043372546 2020-09-02 06:55:52 +0800 <JobTrendr> @MissNess8o8 @McKaylaRoseJ @JoeBiden @CNN There should be no place in anyone’s heart for Wanton violence! We do have a right to defend ourselves. You can’t expect someone to lay down and let a person kill them. If you believe your life is in danger you can use deadly force.
1300929685652725760 2020-09-02 06:53:01 +0800 <JobTrendr> @MissNess8o8 @McKaylaRoseJ @JoeBiden @CNN both agree with that. I’m anti violence 💯 % That being said I’m also for open carry and I’m also for defending oneself if you need to. The fact is 3 ppl attacked him violently with at least one having a gun himself, and all 3 had a long history of crime. I think it was justified
1300926537219420162 2020-09-02 06:40:31 +0800 <JobTrendr> @MissNess8o8 @McKaylaRoseJ @JoeBiden @CNN Of course because only ppl with your viewpoint can protest and defend themselves 👍
1300912645617463296 2020-09-02 05:45:19 +0800 <JobTrendr> @MissNess8o8 @McKaylaRoseJ @JoeBiden @CNN He had as much right as everyone else to be there. He had a right to not be attacked and to defend himself if he was attacked.
1300909907617742859 2020-09-02 05:34:26 +0800 <JobTrendr> @MissNess8o8 @McKaylaRoseJ @JoeBiden @CNN Most of the protestors from both sides shouldn’t be there. Unfortunately the mayor has allowed this to happen by not enforcing laws. He’s going to get off because you can’t beat someone with a deadly weapon, have a gun yourself, try to take the gun, and not get shot
1300909335556632584 2020-09-02 05:32:09 +0800 <JobTrendr> @LiaSchnipper @GeraldoRivera @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Wrong!!! These are democrat voters in democrat controlled cities! Democrats have been silent until now when polls have turned on them. You liberals are going to get away with peddling that trash. Presidents don’t have control over a town in Oregon! He isn’t a dictator
1300908852892893185 2020-09-02 05:30:14 +0800 <JobTrendr> @carolshappylife @GeraldoRivera @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Sorry but presidents don’t have control over Democrat run cities. I guess he could enact the insurrection clause but then liberals would say he’s being a dictator! Nope this is democrat voters doing democrat politicians requests!
1300907989843537927 2020-09-02 05:26:49 +0800 <JobTrendr> @MarkRuffalo like Biden saying absolutely defunding the police then saying he didn’t back defunding!!! Oh and during primary saying no fracking and just yesterday saying “I’ve never said that” I guess we can’t blame him for not remembering, after all he don’t even know his name half the time
1300905993698791424 2020-09-02 05:18:53 +0800 <JobTrendr> @Plain_Janie @Brittymigs Blame China
1300905656195731456 2020-09-02 05:17:32 +0800 <JobTrendr> @MissNess8o8 @McKaylaRoseJ @JoeBiden @CNN So your not denying he was acting in self defense? If you want to argue the legality of him having the gun we can do that, but the fact is what I said was accurate per media reports. That means he will not be convicted and this whole thing was just an attempt to appease the mob
1300851604447531008 2020-09-02 01:42:45 +0800 <JobTrendr> @MissNess8o8 @McKaylaRoseJ @JoeBiden I'll refer you to your favorite news channel. Don't take my word for it! Read the CNN article! Everything I said was factual from reporting.  https://t.co/uyxSM7hOuP
1300851091857379329 2020-09-02 01:40:43 +0800 <JobTrendr> @laceyb_willi @diannemando Maybe tell the media and crazy liberals to act the same way with out current first lady! I don't think it's right to attack Michele but Democrats don't have a ledge to stand on considering how they treat Melania
1300850192812515334 2020-09-02 01:37:09 +0800 <JobTrendr> @tegiortega @wallydog12967 @Infantry0300 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Yea I guess it's better to support Biden! Someone who destroyed 1000s of black families with unfair laws, said he didn't want his sons growing up in a jungle (against desegregation) said the N-word in the senate, and made fun of Indian gas station owners! U go girl!
1300847456561790978 2020-09-02 01:26:16 +0800 <JobTrendr> @HillaryClinton Ur nuts
1300821964387495936 2020-09-01 23:44:59 +0800 <JobTrendr> As I've been saying for months ⁦@JoeBiden⁩ is going to sink like a rock. He can't hold us blue-collar workers because he's owned by the progressive left  https://t.co/gycKUvpX9O
1300799826406277120 2020-09-01 22:17:00 +0800 <JobTrendr> @MissNess8o8 @McKaylaRoseJ @JoeBiden 2 of the victims were trying to take his gun, 1 victim actually had a handgun, and all three victims were violent. This will be ruled self-defense and justified! Don't take my word for it just read the @CNN (can't believe they actually posted it) article.  https://t.co/uyxSM7hOuP
1300797907940052992 2020-09-01 22:09:23 +0800 <JobTrendr> @MissNess8o8 @McKaylaRoseJ @JoeBiden an unarmed Trump supporter was killed by a biden supporter! The incident you are referring to was a 17 yr old young man getting hit in the head by one person shot, the other person shot in the arm had a handgun, and the other one killed tried to hit him with a Molotov cocktail
1300796826736562176 2020-09-01 22:05:05 +0800 <JobTrendr> @JoeBiden We know there wouldn't be any less if you're elected! Ferguson and Boston went up in flames under you! You have been defending the riots for months and only now say something because the polls are turning against you! You're soft a warm butter Joe

1300794202926788613 2020-09-01 21:54:40 +0800 <JobTrendr> @anotherAKGorman @PortlandPolice How about they defend themselves if the Antifa thug is fighting them! You don't get to break the law and resist arrest THEN complain how you're being handled
