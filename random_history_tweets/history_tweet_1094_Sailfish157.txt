1343997647380762625 2020-12-30 03:09:44 +0800 <Sailfish157> Yes. We had one cat, a goofy long-haired Maine Coon cat, who farted loudly. He was a bellows!
1343997407890206720 2020-12-30 03:08:46 +0800 <Sailfish157> Kentucky has Mitch the Itch. He alone is worth about 45 states’ lousy senators!

That $$ will inject the saggy economy w/$ Vitamin B-12. What a bastard this skunk is. @ElaineChao , Couldn’t you have done any better than this VILE SCHMUCK?
1343991747886641154 2020-12-30 02:46:17 +0800 <Sailfish157> You’re kidding? Komrade Mitch is going to get up off his butt to do something helpful for us?

1343702856134746119 2020-12-29 07:38:20 +0800 <Sailfish157> You know who is really a white donestic terrorist? Mitch McConnell! This slithery old fart angled his way into a job where the very people he gets to sh*t all over are forced to pay his salary.
1343702241887350786 2020-12-29 07:35:53 +0800 <Sailfish157> Who were the 134 sh*ts?????
1343702130507526145 2020-12-29 07:35:27 +0800 <Sailfish157> Let us now watch @senatemajldr  torpedo it!  After all, none of us who actually need this money are rich enuf to hold his interest!
1343701615816151040 2020-12-29 07:33:24 +0800 <Sailfish157> The question of the year!!!  Let’s ask the bugger. Say, @senatemajldr @SenateGOP , can you answer this question, below? Things look pretty comfy for you, Bub, yet you act like the nastiest, cruelest creep in D.C. Got a reindeer (or Thune) up your butt?
1343700700367368195 2020-12-29 07:29:46 +0800 <Sailfish157> @Loo_Goo_Two I Adore it!!! And Brigham’s make the best.
1343637766308061185 2020-12-29 03:19:41 +0800 <Sailfish157> @LaraSpencer  On 12/27 I binge watched 10 hrs of Flea Mkt Flip. Your show is mesmerizing. Thank God for it, too. (I was climbing the walls over Trump’s cutting of unemployment benefits.) Thank U for a riveting show. Happy New Year.
1343636869255458818 2020-12-29 03:16:07 +0800 <Sailfish157> @NewYorker  I don’t know Heather Cox Richardson. Has Mr Remnick considered adding her to the masthead? She is worth reading. ps I am one of NYer’s biggest fans. Happy New Year.
1343636314684497922 2020-12-29 03:13:55 +0800 <Sailfish157> Oh, Molly....... I am so sorry.
1343250710822060034 2020-12-28 01:41:40 +0800 <Sailfish157> But watch the GOP senators this week: they (slithery Mitch), won’t  even bring up any House vote to increase the checks. Watch. We can all predict Mitch very easily.
1343249202361618432 2020-12-28 01:35:40 +0800 <Sailfish157> I am so shocked by how vile people can be.
1343248726442315778 2020-12-28 01:33:47 +0800 <Sailfish157> Trump is a an inflicter of cruelty. Gets his jollies punishing people, even the fools who voted for him. Look how he handled Covid pandemic! Knew all along it was bad, yet ridiculed safety procedures, ignored WPA act for ppes, respirators. Used Dickens move to screw on Xmas Eve!
1343247074536677379 2020-12-28 01:27:13 +0800 <Sailfish157> George, Mnuchin wouldn’t bother with self-respect. Since having any would not make him richer, he wouldn’t be concerned.
1343246253556166659 2020-12-28 01:23:57 +0800 <Sailfish157> @HeyHappyJack WOW!!!! So accomplished!
1343245494513004546 2020-12-28 01:20:56 +0800 <Sailfish157> @aliciawitty  Alter is wrong. Trump IS cruelty, sadism. Exh. A: he knew about Covid in Feb but steered people into thinking which put them in harm’s way. Exh. B: cutting people off on Xmas Eve (Dickensian cruelty), while seeming to want more $ for them (insidious sadism!)
1343216586883264513 2020-12-27 23:26:04 +0800 <Sailfish157> MOXY is SAFE!!!! She will have her awful prolapse repaired!!!! Go, MOXY!!!!!!

1342943880174587908 2020-12-27 05:22:26 +0800 <Sailfish157> @senatemajldr @SenateGOP   YES!! He is the greatest piece of rank smelling political sludge that ever swerved into DC! And I know all about McCarthy.
1342942978931908612 2020-12-27 05:18:51 +0800 <Sailfish157> “no food” is rather descriptive. (“Food insecurity” is what you have 5 minutes before your first dinner party starts.)
1342941947237904384 2020-12-27 05:14:45 +0800 <Sailfish157> Gosh, YES!!!  “And move the rabbit ears around, too.”
1342904713340198914 2020-12-27 02:46:48 +0800 <Sailfish157> Trump is a complete waste of time and money. Trump IS waste.
1342903990623883266 2020-12-27 02:43:55 +0800 <Sailfish157> @_houseandgarden Yes. But what does one do when the winds start blowing a mighty gale??
1342903811082498049 2020-12-27 02:43:13 +0800 <Sailfish157> Mitch McConnell is the fast-growing tumor the colonoscopist missed.

1342901362611392513 2020-12-27 02:33:29 +0800 <Sailfish157> @realDonaldTrump  Trump upended Christmas for so many of us. He did it because, as a publicity prostitute, he knew that no one would talk of anything else but HIM. For days. While showing pics of his golf prowess at La Dee Da Golf Course. He is a child.
1342871652833619970 2020-12-27 00:35:26 +0800 <Sailfish157> Rive gauche is #1.

1342871077442215937 2020-12-27 00:33:08 +0800 <Sailfish157> And what about the human remains found??
1342870755487469569 2020-12-27 00:31:52 +0800 <Sailfish157> @VladimirPutinim  Just exactly what big secret can you tell us about Trump? It must be huge. And terrible.
1342870440717541376 2020-12-27 00:30:37 +0800 <Sailfish157> @theshadow_2020 @realDonaldTrump Hmmmm, do you suppose Vlad the putz has a Twitter address? Wouldn’t it be fun to ask him just exactly what he has on Trump?
1342869205331419137 2020-12-27 00:25:42 +0800 <Sailfish157> Wasn’t it awful? I have a cat and dog, thank goodness. Trump made it so incredibly bad.
1342863857396707332 2020-12-27 00:04:27 +0800 <Sailfish157> Here is AUBREY’S miraculous freedom video!! YAY!!! Go, AUBREY!!!!

1342850108052955136 2020-12-26 23:09:49 +0800 <Sailfish157> They are to be ignored. And if they are pests, blocked. Period!

1342849458934046722 2020-12-26 23:07:14 +0800 <Sailfish157> Sure, and what are you smoking today? 4 yrs ago you called it. The GOP party is Batshit Crazy and I hope—but do not worry—that you ALL GO TO HELL!
1342848999997530112 2020-12-26 23:05:25 +0800 <Sailfish157> @realDonaldTrump  You show so well the reason you were voted out of office! You don’t care about Americans! The world is watching you slit your own throat—and the throat of your miserable gop party! You truly are dumber than you look.

1342711089079971840 2020-12-26 13:57:24 +0800 <Sailfish157> @blazen_james @RBReich It would be going to people on unemployment. And the very poor, not to peopke holding jobs.

1342705000531832832 2020-12-26 13:33:13 +0800 <Sailfish157> @Homeoffree61 Yes!! A lot are hunters. A lot are frightened of being broken into. (I am one of the few liberals who despises guns, but I also don’t eat meat, I hate kill shelters, and I think Donald Trump is the Antichrist, on a good day.)
1342703942522777602 2020-12-26 13:29:00 +0800 <Sailfish157> He is dreadful! I hope Yale and Harvard Law School are good and mortified for admitting the sleazy, buttkissy likes of him!

1342702703462535168 2020-12-26 13:24:05 +0800 <Sailfish157> @DWUhlfelderLaw After a fleet of people in hazmat suits goes in there with power washers and gallons of Clorox in spray bottles.
1342702004825681921 2020-12-26 13:21:18 +0800 <Sailfish157> He even looks like the Grinch! Though I think the grinch was spared the McConnell wattle.

People have said “Kentuckians like him.”  I don’t believe it. Nor do I buy the fact that Ernst, Collins, &amp; Graham won legally.

1340078264010895368 2020-12-19 07:35:30 +0800 <Sailfish157> Tell Ron Johnson. Suddenly he worries about the deficit.

1339012317762244610 2020-12-16 08:59:48 +0800 <Sailfish157> Not by a long shot! I have seen many tweets to that effect in the 6 weeks since the election. I also don’t trust Susan Collins’s or Jodi Ernst’s. And I wdn’t be surprised if Mitch himself pulled all the knobs and switches!
1339011808749903873 2020-12-16 08:57:47 +0800 <Sailfish157> He is the biggest slimy sleaze.

1338903866130137088 2020-12-16 01:48:51 +0800 <Sailfish157> Remember, Mitch McConnell thinks only in color: blue and red. In Mitch’s world, blue is bad and red is good. period. PS I hope he learns what it is like to go hungry. To lose his job. To have unemploymt red tape snarls.
1338903225571942402 2020-12-16 01:46:19 +0800 <Sailfish157> Everybody did. How does he manage to get badder and badder?
1338903047456559104 2020-12-16 01:45:36 +0800 <Sailfish157> I will agree as soon as Mitch McConnell moves his wrinkly old butt off of long-hoarded Covid relief!  ONE MAN IN AMERICA IS KEEPING MILLIONS of AMERICANS HANGING BY A STRING.  @SenateGOP @senatemajldr

1338600907127271426 2020-12-15 05:45:00 +0800 <Sailfish157> Does it not enrage you that we still pay Mitch McConnell’s salary, even tho’ he has fully turned his back on suffering Americans? millions of them?

1337448647781478402 2020-12-12 01:26:20 +0800 <Sailfish157> @SenMajLdr @SenateGOP Mitch, how do you sleep at night? eat a fine meal? put on a good coat? and pay your bills? All the while failing to acknowledge the pain and the struggles of Americans at your mercy? You have no mercy. God modeled Satan on you. Merry Christmas.
1337446158197809152 2020-12-12 01:16:27 +0800 <Sailfish157> @mitchellreports Andrea, when, while chatting w/Zeke, you mentioned “President Tweet”, I believe you meant to say “President Twit.”

1337440949643980805 2020-12-12 00:55:45 +0800 <Sailfish157> I yearn for the day when no longer does anyone have to  worry about pleasing Mitch McConnell. Mitch McConnell is more evil than Trump. Mitch McConnell belongs on another planet, exercising his extreme BASTARDness there.

1329210022916730887 2020-11-19 07:48:59 +0800 <Sailfish157> @bvanhoovan Do tors do not have to see every patient; why should all veterinarians have to see all pats? This of course excludes emergencies.
1329122148187844609 2020-11-19 01:59:48 +0800 <Sailfish157> This vet prefaced his sign with “I have come to that time in my career when I can pick &amp; choose my clients. I am more interested in caring for animals that are truly loved for themselves than those animals bred solely to make money for the owner.”

1329101105989640193 2020-11-19 00:36:11 +0800 <Sailfish157> Brigitte, I pledge $10 each for SHADOW and LINDY. They are healthy, good dogs who should be going to loving homes, not sacrificed for the sole sake of expediency.
1329100698231910402 2020-11-19 00:34:34 +0800 <Sailfish157> YES. It was more than “criminal negligence” to steer Americans toward their doom while knowing full well what Covid meant and what it was capable of.

1324188171668803587 2020-11-05 11:13:57 +0800 <Sailfish157> @PeterAskin1 Just paid my pledge, Peter. I am so relieved SADIE is safe!
1324186515300372481 2020-11-05 11:07:22 +0800 <Sailfish157> Amen!
1324185975581454336 2020-11-05 11:05:13 +0800 <Sailfish157> That is just what I thought, too!And I sense a problem, too, bec Rachel comes in quickly to explain what he just said.  (And why always the same damn pants???)
1324185095318753280 2020-11-05 11:01:43 +0800 <Sailfish157> AN ATROCITY!!!
1324184113679683584 2020-11-05 10:57:49 +0800 <Sailfish157> @SworldBabbit I haven’t heard from Susie yet either. She must be away or just taking a breather. Did you see the Facebook link to Browny on the original post? That is where I found the info on her. Btw, no answer to my Q from MAS about Browny’s availability....
1324177726631194624 2020-11-05 10:32:26 +0800 <Sailfish157> @SworldBabbit True!!!
1324177409890017280 2020-11-05 10:31:11 +0800 <Sailfish157> @PoundHoundsResQ @LindaMayberry9 @louiedadawg @mamashov3 @YellwBrckRd Paid my pledge for the beautiful KING ROY.  I am so happy for him!
1324087446183813120 2020-11-05 04:33:42 +0800 <Sailfish157> I agree with you, AR Clark!!  You have to be vicious and cruel and/or have suffered a significant brain injury to support a monster, a vile demagogue, like Trump. NO EXCUSES!
1324086436187037698 2020-11-05 04:29:41 +0800 <Sailfish157> UGH!!
1324086153939722241 2020-11-05 04:28:34 +0800 <Sailfish157> @JonLemire Oh, no!!!!
1324086040106278913 2020-11-05 04:28:06 +0800 <Sailfish157> I have missed your punditing in msnbc, Prof. Painter.  Good to hear from you today.
1324085292232511489 2020-11-05 04:25:08 +0800 <Sailfish157> You are far from alone, sir!
1324084021173932034 2020-11-05 04:20:05 +0800 <Sailfish157> @SethAbramson Seth, with the state of the man’s health what it is, do you really think he will even be compos mentis in 4 yrs?
1324083732282834951 2020-11-05 04:18:56 +0800 <Sailfish157> @nancy_dills @Doug415510330 I want to be there right now! Thank you for a lovely photo.
1324083385283870721 2020-11-05 04:17:33 +0800 <Sailfish157> I agree.  All of them:  Gov, Lt. Gov, and AG of Penn. are most impressive.
1324082305187631111 2020-11-05 04:13:16 +0800 <Sailfish157> @TheRickyDavila @gullsimpression Would Barr be able to stop it, though, keep him out of jail?  (I have no idea mself.)
1324081955793784834 2020-11-05 04:11:53 +0800 <Sailfish157> @maddow  Rachel, I wonder if Hillary is feeling somewhat vindicated? After hearing for 4 yrs “how poor a candidate she was,” etc, voters did just about what they did in ‘16.
1324081524862537729 2020-11-05 04:10:10 +0800 <Sailfish157> @SamLitzinger We are in mourning, Sam. We are stunned to learn so many people could turn their back on Covid mishandling and 230K needless dearhs! He is a pig, &amp; we are heartbroken and ashamed.
1324081090072641539 2020-11-05 04:08:26 +0800 <Sailfish157> @diulusj @SandraK93322487 John is a wonderful defender of animals. You must trust that he has seen it all. I know what U R saying: somebody in dire straits didn’t know what to do, feared $$ bills. But please try to understand this is a very volatile, deeply depressing subject, dogs in kill pounds.
1324080152188489733 2020-11-05 04:04:43 +0800 <Sailfish157> @SamLitzinger True, Sam.
1324079817675935744 2020-11-05 04:03:23 +0800 <Sailfish157> @GGinCHS @GaryPeters Last I saw, he was ahead.
1324079684880130048 2020-11-05 04:02:51 +0800 <Sailfish157> @nixw20 @glennkirschner2 Yes, but it still won’t clear him of his state crimes.  Look out, SDNY! And the wonderful AG of NY!
1324079332642402307 2020-11-05 04:01:27 +0800 <Sailfish157> @Oooooo_Donna I love this! Good for you, Zimbabwe!!!
1324079049061343235 2020-11-05 04:00:20 +0800 <Sailfish157> Good one, George!
1324078935248982027 2020-11-05 03:59:53 +0800 <Sailfish157> @HappyPixr @JeanHaggerty1 When I see one of these glorious creatures, I take it as a sign from God. (Yes, I am getting schmaltzy these days...)
1324078165938130946 2020-11-05 03:56:49 +0800 <Sailfish157> Hey, David. So good to hear from you.
1324077910668488707 2020-11-05 03:55:48 +0800 <Sailfish157> @gydyup The one good piece of news about the Senate I have heard in last hour is:  SIX Senate seats are still undecided.  Yay, I think.
1324060844167204868 2020-11-05 02:47:59 +0800 <Sailfish157> @MasterAuthor @RawlinsandCo Are they taking the dog to be euthanized?
1324060679930810370 2020-11-05 02:47:20 +0800 <Sailfish157> @G8trz4ever @ElieNYC She also looks like hell today.
1324060323155005442 2020-11-05 02:45:55 +0800 <Sailfish157> @PaineSister @ChristaylJ @TruBluRayne So will I!
1324060069969932292 2020-11-05 02:44:55 +0800 <Sailfish157> Not good! I cannot, I refuse to believe we will have the monster in charge of the Senate again!!
1324040207117811713 2020-11-05 01:25:59 +0800 <Sailfish157> BRODIE is wonderful!!! What a dog! Watch his video. Come on, San Bernardino, step up for this great guy!
1324038661927743489 2020-11-05 01:19:51 +0800 <Sailfish157> @IJefTomI Right!
1324035812686733313 2020-11-05 01:08:31 +0800 <Sailfish157> Big time.
1324035636102340610 2020-11-05 01:07:49 +0800 <Sailfish157> @rachelquenzer @TravelingUS Love this, Rachel!
1324034231849357313 2020-11-05 01:02:14 +0800 <Sailfish157> And Acting Secretary of the Treasury Elizabeth Warren.
1324032881136705536 2020-11-05 00:56:52 +0800 <Sailfish157> You said it!
1324032283838435329 2020-11-05 00:54:30 +0800 <Sailfish157> But Jake, aren’t there still votes to count?  Or are these results set in stone??
1324032010676043778 2020-11-05 00:53:25 +0800 <Sailfish157> Here is a sentence designed to bring a grin to your face:
1324031835089883136 2020-11-05 00:52:43 +0800 <Sailfish157> @AliVelshi @SteveKornacki If only, Ali, you could get him to 1) talk a wee bit slower, 2) stop mentioning 2016 results (it’s like comparing apples to Kharman Ghias), and 3) a new pair of pants. (I bet those are his lucky pants....)
1324030898036244480 2020-11-05 00:49:00 +0800 <Sailfish157> This is brilliant.
1324030264943824897 2020-11-05 00:46:29 +0800 <Sailfish157> Completely true!!!
1324030105816125441 2020-11-05 00:45:51 +0800 <Sailfish157> VERY VERY Good to hear, Steve.
1324029287444434946 2020-11-05 00:42:36 +0800 <Sailfish157> @SworldBabbit Lynn, I found BROWNY on Memphis Animal Services fb page, asked if she were still available. MAS btw is open from 12-4pm. From her fb description: “[Browny #MASA790 ] To schedule an appointment to meet Browny, email your name/phone number to mas@memphistn.gov. “ Will let U know!
1324021571946745856 2020-11-05 00:11:56 +0800 <Sailfish157> @SworldBabbit @reddogsusie   Susie, Lynn is very interested in BROWNIE. What should be her next step—contacting MAS?  Lynn, Susie knows all about the MAS dogs.
1323865185115951104 2020-11-04 13:50:31 +0800 <Sailfish157> TERRIBLE!  Dangerous, too.
1323862296213540866 2020-11-04 13:39:02 +0800 <Sailfish157> CUPPY, the gray tiger girl, is at Brooklyn NY ACC, arriving there only because her parents are moving to a no-pets place. She is 5, in great health &amp; a little shy but FRIENDLY. Maybe you could RETWEET CUPPY in hopes that she finds her special someone to love?  Pledges help, too!
1323859543886090246 2020-11-04 13:28:06 +0800 <Sailfish157> @benjaminwittes @Malinowski Great person!!! Good for New Jersey.
1323858609130930176 2020-11-04 13:24:23 +0800 <Sailfish157> Yes, Ahmed, precisely!
1323857776125378560 2020-11-04 13:21:04 +0800 <Sailfish157> Is it simply that Atlanta-area votes  (&gt;1.1M) aren’t in yet?
1323853417874366475 2020-11-04 13:03:45 +0800 <Sailfish157> Amy, aren’t there mail-in votes still to count in Ohio?  (I hate it when states are “called” for one or the other. Especially now. Ohio has a couple million mail-in ballots.)
1323852201832423424 2020-11-04 12:58:55 +0800 <Sailfish157> Ricky, what confuses me is how the tv shows “call” states for one or the other. I then stupidly take that to mean Set. In. Stone.  The projections are as confusing!
1323851547298668544 2020-11-04 12:56:19 +0800 <Sailfish157> @SoaringHeart3 @TheRickyDavila @kathid_d I love him! ‘Am from Cape Cod. He is terrific.
1323850643598135297 2020-11-04 12:52:44 +0800 <Sailfish157> @PeterAskin1 $10 pledge.
1323850532340064257 2020-11-04 12:52:17 +0800 <Sailfish157> We Americans who support Biden are wondering the very same thing! Well, that side doesn’t like mask wearing or social distancing. Maybe they will diminish their numbers w/this crazy behavior.
1323849112647835649 2020-11-04 12:46:39 +0800 <Sailfish157> TONS of mail-in ballots are in the wings, waiting to be counted. What we are seeing for returns now is the “red mirage”—meaning, the votes that came in today are the numbers being reported now. (More Repubs vote on day of election, so this “mirage” was forecast. Tell him to relax
1323848247467741184 2020-11-04 12:43:12 +0800 <Sailfish157> @CanadianReports 192-114 Biden-Trump, as of 11:43pm. msnbc

1323831643703005185 2020-11-04 11:37:14 +0800 <Sailfish157> @catsrangels2 @bplace01 Oh, I know it!  And the comparisons with 2016 results county by county.
1323826600794857478 2020-11-04 11:17:11 +0800 <Sailfish157> Thank you very much, USPS De Juoy.
1323826419991040005 2020-11-04 11:16:28 +0800 <Sailfish157> And it is truly gagsome. Are people just brainwashed???
1323826095616106497 2020-11-04 11:15:11 +0800 <Sailfish157> @bplace01 msnbc and it’s frustrating.  Not a fan of the guy at the board.
1323825935569833986 2020-11-04 11:14:33 +0800 <Sailfish157> @PeterAskin1 @jamtartladyharp I am so sorry to hear this! Poor little thing.

1323825487383330818 2020-11-04 11:12:46 +0800 <Sailfish157> Me too!!! I cannot tear self away, yet it’s so ... so ..... MADDENING!!
1323825209695227905 2020-11-04 11:11:40 +0800 <Sailfish157> And lock himself into a Covid-crawling space. Smart.
1323824920082657280 2020-11-04 11:10:31 +0800 <Sailfish157> Exactly!  This is a nation of cretins!!!
1323824785705623553 2020-11-04 11:09:59 +0800 <Sailfish157> @DearAuntCrabby Not good.

1323714753886359559 2020-11-04 03:52:45 +0800 <Sailfish157> @PrincessBravato Dunno, but I wonder how many people she had to elbow past to get that plum position behind him?

1323703159227899906 2020-11-04 03:06:41 +0800 <Sailfish157> @jaxbra Apparently the wild deer came to visit the two dogs every day. Finally, the dogs’ parents bought the huge dog bed and, as you see, the deer made himself comfy.

1323699342298042369 2020-11-04 02:51:31 +0800 <Sailfish157> Can this young 63-yo join in? (I had no trouble marching 17 miles on day of Women’s March in DC in Jan of 2017.)

1323674322574184453 2020-11-04 01:12:05 +0800 <Sailfish157> @KMark1969 Hello! The very first town in USA to declare its votes, Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, has voted 5-0 for Biden. Yes, that is 5 votes. They vote at 12:01 am on election day. It gave me so much hope, this microscopic victory! Thank you, NZ. xxxx oooo

1321547639457009665 2020-10-29 04:21:25 +0800 <Sailfish157> Will you ever forget the scene in which he sobbed and screamed diring his hearing?  Yes, play it all back. Surely, he has done something impeachable by now?
1321547137658851328 2020-10-29 04:19:25 +0800 <Sailfish157> Wowee! Elena kicked Brett right where his brain should be.  This comment is a BEAUT!
1321546741884293130 2020-10-29 04:17:51 +0800 <Sailfish157> Barrett is not swift.
1321546590381871106 2020-10-29 04:17:14 +0800 <Sailfish157> @RonaldKlain Mr. Klain, I would not honor him by using the term Justice in connection with him. A bunch of Senate Bubbas getting fed and fat on greasy billionaire dough made him a “Justice”. End of story.
1321545650023124992 2020-10-29 04:13:30 +0800 <Sailfish157> Wow!  He is meaty-oaker all right!  He enrages me bec in college I knew by accident several men like him, who behaved the way he did to women, and still got away with it.
1321545023176007684 2020-10-29 04:11:01 +0800 <Sailfish157> Mr Stern’s tweet fascinates me. So Kavanaugh was once considered a brilliant legal mind.... Seriously?
1321543753035894786 2020-10-29 04:05:58 +0800 <Sailfish157> @landpsychology Think twice about that. I find them to be difficult to manage. If you do get one, Pleeeze try a Dalmation rescue group!
1321543325028130818 2020-10-29 04:04:16 +0800 <Sailfish157> They are dropping because Mitch left town without sending out more Covid relief! @realDonaldTrump
1321542414746767361 2020-10-29 04:00:39 +0800 <Sailfish157> “....Because of the sheer size of the crowd, we deployed 40 shuttle buses instead of the normal 15, but local road closures and resulting congestion caused delays,” Samantha Zager, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, said in a statement.”
1321541687701889024 2020-10-29 03:57:46 +0800 <Sailfish157> @CollinsDionte Is this what happened? They truly did NOT have a way to bring them back to cars??
1321540828704219137 2020-10-29 03:54:21 +0800 <Sailfish157> Read this about the largesse known as Trump.
1321540547757154307 2020-10-29 03:53:14 +0800 <Sailfish157> These two horses are safe, thanks to kind donations!!! YAY!!!
1321540302130323456 2020-10-29 03:52:15 +0800 <Sailfish157> Am trying to understand this. Did Trump’s campaign pay to rent the buses that brought rally goers to the airport, miles away, then NOT pay for the buses to bring them back to their cars? Someone, pls tell me. (Will the frostbitten still vote for him?)
1321539214132023296 2020-10-29 03:47:56 +0800 <Sailfish157> Marsha Blackburn has a Bachelor of Science in Home Ec fr Mississippi State, 1974. Amazing background (I thot she had a JD.) And she won a beauty pageant. Fascinating. She gives Home Ec majors &amp; beauty pageants a bad name.
1321538004008271875 2020-10-29 03:43:07 +0800 <Sailfish157> Did you hear today on msnbc that Jaime has more campaign dough than Trump? much more.
1321537270592212994 2020-10-29 03:40:12 +0800 <Sailfish157> Republican former Rep. Jeff Blake does a TV for Biden....!
1321536742604918789 2020-10-29 03:38:07 +0800 <Sailfish157> @Jessmegandmum @cobalttash I love your new baby, MERRYN! Those chubby legs and feet are adorable!
1321536297018839046 2020-10-29 03:36:20 +0800 <Sailfish157> Please look at 7-yo FRY. The MAS staff have worked w/him and he is now more acclimated, loving being o/o/his cage esp. Pls RETWEET FRY. Maybe he will  catch the eye of someone who likes senior dogs!  $10

1321181417322274819 2020-10-28 04:06:10 +0800 <Sailfish157> You cannot believe anyone could be so scrimey as to bill the US Government $6K for a rose centerpiece and $3 each for a serving of water in a glass. Trust Trump, the cheapskate. This piece is fascinating!
1321179774837051395 2020-10-28 03:59:39 +0800 <Sailfish157> YESSS!!!! Trump in action at his rallies!!!

He is finally out of that gig, now needing a safe new owner to love and hang out with. JACK is a LOVE (you see this in  https://t.co/JY6oMog10y abused dogs) and needs to get the word out fast. RETWEET JACK!
1321172865480298498 2020-10-28 03:32:11 +0800 <Sailfish157> @bvanhoovan @goldendogs4 @Starr6 Me, too, Brigitte. I am still yrying to find their posts, but I pledge $10 each for JACK and RUSSELL.

1321170614162464769 2020-10-28 03:23:15 +0800 <Sailfish157> WOWEE!! No sooner do I retweet PIPPIE the PUPPIE than I learn this sweetie has a “hold” by a rescue group! Wonderful, PIPPIE! You will make some lovely person a most loving dog! xxxooo

1321126505385177091 2020-10-28 00:27:58 +0800 <Sailfish157> Too lil too late. And I thought ot was interesting that Murkowski never rose to her feet w/the other gop senators to celebrate the confirmn. vote.
1321126049888034817 2020-10-28 00:26:10 +0800 <Sailfish157> KEKE  WAS  JUST  RESCUED! YAY!!!!

1321122607958269952 2020-10-28 00:12:29 +0800 <Sailfish157> Stephen Breyer is a lovely, softspoken man.  He kind of freaked one day in Harvard Sq. (mid-1990s) when I recognized him on the street.
1321121446685528064 2020-10-28 00:07:52 +0800 <Sailfish157> Right! And can you imagine what Barrett is going to drool all over everything along with him?
1321121095664193537 2020-10-28 00:06:29 +0800 <Sailfish157> o
1321121092505919489 2020-10-28 00:06:28 +0800 <Sailfish157> Not too many. We were smarter than to vote for the big load who ran against her.
1321119594111770626 2020-10-28 00:00:31 +0800 <Sailfish157> @mwolfers @maddow I am wondering if he contracted Covid at the now infamous Rose Garden ceremony for Barrett.
1320919376187543553 2020-10-27 10:44:55 +0800 <Sailfish157> @McKlare @KwikWarren @Clondore @JulieSummerman You are RIGHT! Her big phrase was “slipped the surly bonds of this earth....”  How I confused this w/thousand points of light is bizarre. My apologies!
1320917977374560262 2020-10-27 10:39:21 +0800 <Sailfish157> @McKlare @KwikWarren @Clondore @JulieSummerman No. She came up with the phrase and idea.
1320913292588711936 2020-10-27 10:20:44 +0800 <Sailfish157> @Clondore @KwikWarren @JulieSummerman Reagan’s speechwriter (“thousand points of light” was hers). A sanctimonious A-hole who is lulled by the sound of her own voice.
1320912209191620611 2020-10-27 10:16:26 +0800 <Sailfish157> I am the President of the First Lady of Poland’s Fan Club! What a hot ticket.
1320911602485440512 2020-10-27 10:14:02 +0800 <Sailfish157> Especially when at least TWO of those SC justices were caught diddling and abusing women! You old enuf to remember Thomas’s confirmation hearing and Anita Hill?
1320911168505024513 2020-10-27 10:12:18 +0800 <Sailfish157> Red-hot RIPPING!!!!!!?
1320910212660928517 2020-10-27 10:08:30 +0800 <Sailfish157> I guess I’m superstitious. If my professional entree to D.C. become THE superspreader event of the season, I think I would read those tea leaves and decide to get the hell away from DC as fast as possible. Amy Barrett is an idiot.
1320909193587630081 2020-10-27 10:04:27 +0800 <Sailfish157> Ha! Watch this!!!!
1320908179442667520 2020-10-27 10:00:25 +0800 <Sailfish157> And I’d stick the load named Clarence Diddle Thomas and Lifeless Alito up there with them! Ha! There are two publicly exposed perverts on the Supreme Court: Thomas and Kavanaugh!
1320907376996851712 2020-10-27 09:57:14 +0800 <Sailfish157> Truly!
1320907190811676673 2020-10-27 09:56:30 +0800 <Sailfish157> Harry, what will she do when horny Brett takes a shot at her?
1320906684534034433 2020-10-27 09:54:29 +0800 <Sailfish157> @whitepeonyfarm @MelodyLenz6 Yay! Go Mason!!!!
1320906476794322945 2020-10-27 09:53:39 +0800 <Sailfish157> Aren’t they nice?
1320906353460862979 2020-10-27 09:53:10 +0800 <Sailfish157> Connie, “meanness” doesn’t begin to cover it! Blistering cruelty is more like it.
1320905912207446016 2020-10-27 09:51:25 +0800 <Sailfish157> Exactly. One shitty little man who mused aloud when the Covid virus hit NYC, “This Covid thing appears to be a blue state problem,” did all the court destruction by himself. The 200 ultraconservative judges he rammed thru confirmation, then this supreme ditz from Notre Dame....
1320904947702157313 2020-10-27 09:47:35 +0800 <Sailfish157> She doesn’t care. Her rigid ideology, she thinks, gives her carte blanche to tear everything down. How else could you read her pointed parading around of all her kids—her sanctimonious fertility—as she sat thru her questioning?
1320903978616573952 2020-10-27 09:43:44 +0800 <Sailfish157> @Pnaplehead @BeineckeLibrary Thank you so much, Lisa. xxx ooo

1320791807064707072 2020-10-27 02:18:00 +0800 <Sailfish157> @syd_akaYog I would say that SYD is an “Appaloosa Pittie”, his markings are so gorgeous!
1320791509332090884 2020-10-27 02:16:49 +0800 <Sailfish157> @SandraK93322487 Sandra, once more I am helpless. Nowhere on that link do I see a link to Paypal for donations. BUT ignore this; I just emailed the group to ask THEM. Don’t you worry about this! xxoo

1320788054785875968 2020-10-27 02:03:05 +0800 <Sailfish157> @washingtonpost I wdn’t call any POTUS who so fatally fouled the Supreme Court as going quietly. Or who created the horror on the Tex-Mex border; who made us the global laughingstock; who let so many of his people die when he had a chance 2 save them, as going quietly. I dont care how he leaves!
1320785968388100096 2020-10-27 01:54:48 +0800 <Sailfish157> KOYA IS SAFE!!!!!!! YAY!!!!!

(They will then get sick and CLOG THE HOSPITALS when they did not have to, burning out EMTs, RNs, MDs!) Yes, they do appear to be trying to wipe themselves out!

1316758811995181056 2020-10-15 23:12:19 +0800 <Sailfish157> “Seeking refuge in ignorance and evasion...” Makes her a splendid metaphor for that part of the electorate that supports Trump!

1316755841555607553 2020-10-15 23:00:31 +0800 <Sailfish157> He is right, Turley. Covid made some things very simple to see and understand. If you don’t like the language, get outta the kitchen. I’d go so far as to say Trump’s actions bespeak a serial butcher.
1316755380442198016 2020-10-15 22:58:41 +0800 <Sailfish157> This is a perfectly fascinating museum!! I could spend six months there and not see a tenth of the collections. Cannot wait for the moment when the world gives the All Clear! and I can visit again.

1316563685867958273 2020-10-15 10:16:57 +0800 <Sailfish157> If you needed proof that Trump is a serial killer, here you go. Herd immunity-finagling sacrifices lots and lots and lots of inncent people, who didn’t particularly wish to die.
1316563201455259648 2020-10-15 10:15:02 +0800 <Sailfish157> @nixw20 And a creepy observation I am or am not proud of: Ted Cruz reminds me of Mr. Haney on Green Acres. Same hi-pitched twang in their voices.

1316557786680000516 2020-10-15 09:53:31 +0800 <Sailfish157> Barrett is doing herself no favors by playing it overly cagey. It makes her look like a legal cretin. Today’s body blow from her Notre Dame Law Sch colleagues had to hurt, too.
1316557174563385350 2020-10-15 09:51:05 +0800 <Sailfish157> She wants you to know she had a thousand kids.

I note that new cars are coming down in height (yay). This Audi is better than any of the new Volvos. All I want is my old Volvo 240 back. Had so much hauling space.
1316518812083257344 2020-10-15 07:18:39 +0800 <Sailfish157> I pledge $20 for CANDY, Susie. Please RETWEET CANDY! She is a nice dog with a couple of fixable issues. xx oo

1316470833573957633 2020-10-15 04:08:00 +0800 <Sailfish157> How is it that there can be quite  so many reckless, stupid people?  This behavior is beyond shockng. How many of them think they will be around a year from now?

Someone showed an account of a big do that Jeff Shell held for Kamala Harris recently. Mebbe that is why this spectacle is happening? NBC runs this town hall at its peril! People are pissed!

If buck indeed stops with him, I pray he loses his job. But if it was Jeff Shell’s big idea (head of NBC Universal, MBC’s parent co.) then I hope he goes! OUTRAGEOUS!
1316460621970518016 2020-10-15 03:27:25 +0800 <Sailfish157> This article names so many members of Congress who have tested positive, both Repubs and Dems. Are they getting it inside the Capitol? This is terrifying!

1316403146663571461 2020-10-14 23:39:02 +0800 <Sailfish157> Rob, I believe he committed passive-aggressive genocide back in Feb, when he knew but would not tell his people how deadly Covid was. And I won’t buy another Woodward product after he, too, knew. He could have done something!
1316401727835385859 2020-10-14 23:33:24 +0800 <Sailfish157> Fascinating! We in the Boston viewing area had to suffer thru Matt Lauer for a few years. No one could stand him in town, and it had nothing to do with his vulgar sexual incontinence. He was simply a 1st-class rotter.

What can they be thinking? Is that event the first instance of people taking their life into their hands by attending a WH ceremony?

Wouldn’t it be the political horror of American political history if several of these GOP senators just keeled over and died before their precious vote! My Q is rhetorical, but the cavalier way they treat Covid provokes the Q; their attitude is out of Sci Fi!!

He doesn’t give a timker’s damn about a stimulus pkg for poor &amp; unemployed people.
1313203757396750336 2020-10-06 03:45:48 +0800 <Sailfish157> It is interesting to me that McConnell was not at the Rose Garden Ceremony. He must have had his own Bedminster-type fundraiser to go to. After all, high rollers are McConnell’s only constituents. He cares only about people who have really good health insurance.

1313191892813860867 2020-10-06 02:58:39 +0800 <Sailfish157> @DrEricDing @JayandSteve Horrendous!!
1313191342592397316 2020-10-06 02:56:28 +0800 <Sailfish157> I believe he also sent Hicks’s “positive for Covid” news out before his own so that it would appear that she gave Covid to him. Then he had to boot it to Bedminster to kiss high-roller bum before his news cd go public. He is 100% image.
1313179620750045189 2020-10-06 02:09:53 +0800 <Sailfish157> @jeffjarvis @VinGuptaMD I know it! The poor man is on at all hours of the day. Then, in the ICU this past weekend?  Well, Dr Gupta trained in Boston, so he has learned to be awake 168 hrs a week.
1313178532999245825 2020-10-06 02:05:34 +0800 <Sailfish157> Yes. No Republican gave you Social Security, Medicare, the Voting Rights Act, or Obamacare. BUT—Obama borrowed the O-Care template from Republican senator Mitt Romney, developed when Romney was Massachusetts’ governor.
1313177869338775553 2020-10-06 02:02:56 +0800 <Sailfish157> @Bill_Maxwell_ Yes. And if I couldn’t stand that long, I’d bring a lawn chair and a book.
1313177534830444556 2020-10-06 02:01:36 +0800 <Sailfish157> You don’t do it smoothly, or painlessly, unless you are frail. But do it, you gotta.  I have done it and the hosts were actually relieved. Thanksgiving &amp; the holidays will be tough this year.
1313176632723681282 2020-10-06 01:58:01 +0800 <Sailfish157> @beautifulskinb5 Oh, yes! I happen to have a dog in the current Senate fight to nominate the conservative judge (she will take ACA care away). It is exhausting to sit and watch and count new positive cases like a sicko!
1313176047949688832 2020-10-06 01:55:42 +0800 <Sailfish157> @Amy_Siskind Amy, is it ghoulish of me to conclude here that no clear, definite news is bad news?
1313167673535102976 2020-10-06 01:22:25 +0800 <Sailfish157> In Finland!!!

1313120920916168706 2020-10-05 22:16:38 +0800 <Sailfish157> @neal_katyal Mr. Katyal, any truth to the notion that an impeached president “cannot appoint judges”? I apologize for bugging you. Thank you for any help U can give. (I am frantic about losing my ACA care!)
1313120183901450240 2020-10-05 22:13:43 +0800 <Sailfish157> Rather more like “projectile dysfunction”.

1313118596575506434 2020-10-05 22:07:24 +0800 <Sailfish157> @sfpelosi Christine, Alexandra’s fantastic (!!!) film about fat cat donors is in the Documentaries section of Movies in On Demand. I saw it, then tried like heck to tell her what a wonderful job she did. Wd U kindly share my slobbery tweet w/her?
1313116913090932736 2020-10-05 22:00:43 +0800 <Sailfish157> @Cleavon_MD Dr Cleavon, did the ordnance you hold in your hand in profile pic ever detonate?  I come from an area where ordnance is often found on beaches and embedded in trees  (musket balls -8 pounders- fr War of 1812).

1313113419978076160 2020-10-05 21:46:50 +0800 <Sailfish157> @HalstonA Well, that in itself, Halston, was an humanitarian act on your part. I put your tweet (sans yr name) up on Facebook over the weekend, and asked all my lawyer pals if they cd weigh in. Now I’ll try Tribe.  I am frantic; I can’t lose my ACA care! Thank you, sir.
1313106496222375937 2020-10-05 21:19:19 +0800 <Sailfish157> Is this “info” true or a hoax?
1313104161299365888 2020-10-05 21:10:03 +0800 <Sailfish157> Trump Tower would be another good building to light up in blue.
1313103876623663105 2020-10-05 21:08:55 +0800 <Sailfish157> @kneerecon @WCaddict @SteveKornacki  If, in 2016, Hillary had been “wildly unpopular,” she wouldn’t have won 3M more votes than Trump. And wouldn’t still be sitting around wondering if  Vlad Putin hacked into Diebolds in Nov. 2016.
1313102370100916227 2020-10-05 21:02:55 +0800 <Sailfish157> Pledge $10 to get the puppies—sick and barely hanging on—and their mom, LADY, medical treatment fast. Yes, LADY’S owner should be arrested! Disgraceful!!! Please would you RETWEET LADY? xxxooo

1313100309917569024 2020-10-05 20:54:44 +0800 <Sailfish157> @chipfranklin He wouldn’t bother to think about it.  He thinks the way Kim Jong-un thinks.
1313099718789148673 2020-10-05 20:52:23 +0800 <Sailfish157> @SenWhitehouse My blood flowed cold, Sen. Whitehouse.  I am, 63, single, unemployed, &amp; poor, and ACA is my lifeline. And after yr description of the pressure Mitch is under to shove Barrett onto the SC, I know now that I will lose my ACA—on Barrett’s 1st vote. GOP are sadists.

1313087452790370308 2020-10-05 20:03:39 +0800 <Sailfish157> @Danjon73 Maybe. The only reason I would lean toward no is, he lives for those rallies. And having Covid would definitely sideline him there.
1313086791919042562 2020-10-05 20:01:01 +0800 <Sailfish157> Yes! Nothing like voting in a President who then turns around and kills you. And for the ones still standing, he is now running as fast as he can to revoke their health insurance. What a guy!
1313084811813285890 2020-10-05 19:53:09 +0800 <Sailfish157> @JonLemire U are my favorite reporter. I try to tune in when I think U will B speaking, eg, MorningJoe. The b/w graphic behind you, tho’, distracts viewer’s eye. Maybe U cd turn 90 degrees or so in yr chair so that viewer can concentr on you. I don’t want to miss anything U say.

1312886299611852800 2020-10-05 06:44:20 +0800 <Sailfish157> We still cannot fully comprehend titanic ignorance. These people have no idea there is a deadly virus. This scene reminded me of North Korea. Typhoid Mary out among her faithful followers, killing them.
1312885895608102912 2020-10-05 06:42:44 +0800 <Sailfish157> I am just hoping that all of those rabble rousers outside Walter Reed, who maybe caught some of his spittle, are those odious proud boys.

With a face like Selleck’s, hot pants were an annoying distraction (“when is he going to split them while fighting crime?” was my usual thought.)

1312787615742074882 2020-10-05 00:12:12 +0800 <Sailfish157> @jkbjournalist  This is my thought.  The misspeak of 72 hrs by Conley has been driving me nuts since he uttered it.
1312787035376291841 2020-10-05 00:09:54 +0800 <Sailfish157> Has Dr. Conley received supplemental oxygen today?
1312786894246293504 2020-10-05 00:09:20 +0800 <Sailfish157> @PoCoAustinPa Maybe, but I think a Covid diagnosis would be the last thing he would use.
1312786131973476353 2020-10-05 00:06:18 +0800 <Sailfish157> I wonder how any patient at Walter Reed slept last night. Rabble rousers weren’t too considerate.
1312785814066065408 2020-10-05 00:05:03 +0800 <Sailfish157> The quote 72-hour misspeak fr Dr Conley was probly not one. It would be just like conniving Trump to have Hope Hicks’s Covid news go public—and many hours before—his own. In that way, she, not he, would look like the Covid heavy. AND he’d get to go to Bedminster for the handout.
1312777214459555843 2020-10-04 23:30:52 +0800 <Sailfish157> IZZY again.
1312777161166721024 2020-10-04 23:30:40 +0800 <Sailfish157> IZZY, exhausted and terrified, and fresh from delivering puppies no one can find (!), is at Palm Valley hi kill Please RETWEET her. Maybe we can help get her out of there. ‘pledge $10.
1312776139211972610 2020-10-04 23:26:36 +0800 <Sailfish157> No different from anything he has been doing for last 4 yrs.

1312524589268783106 2020-10-04 06:47:02 +0800 <Sailfish157> Mr. Franklin: Close to 400 cars are clogging the Massachusetts highways now, a parade of cars showing support for Trump. They were on the news. They started in Plymouth, MA.  BIG BAD BOOFER BUBBAS ARE everywhere, even here in pious New England. Gawd help us.

1312511054216265728 2020-10-04 05:53:15 +0800 <Sailfish157> Look at TANK now, after his return! Awful!!!!!!
1312510834078179328 2020-10-04 05:52:22 +0800 <Sailfish157> TANK lasted 6 weeks with his adopters. Then they brought him back. Look at him. (The  scary part is, Dog “returns” go straight to death row.) Would U be so kind as to RETWEET this forlorn dog, TANK, maybe pledge, too? ‘Wish TANK cd tell us what happened. ‘pledge $10.
1312509757660393472 2020-10-04 05:48:06 +0800 <Sailfish157> I had no idea Graham was one of them backwoods Bubbas. Great.

1312506069290082304 2020-10-04 05:33:26 +0800 <Sailfish157> I hope to goodness Trump gets out of bed tomorrow morning and runs for the hills to do a touchy-touchy-some-more rally with the PROUD BOYS!
1312505368002486272 2020-10-04 05:30:39 +0800 <Sailfish157> The Belgians do this, too? WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN? WHO STARVES DOGS?
1312504728287277056 2020-10-04 05:28:07 +0800 <Sailfish157> Betw 30 and 50 GOP big rollers coughed up a quarter of a million dollars each to kissy face w/Trump at Bedminster. Guess what else they will be coughing up soon?  The GOP used to be “the party of greed”. (J.K. Galbraith). It is now the party of rich ignorami.
1312503455106310145 2020-10-04 05:23:03 +0800 <Sailfish157> Oh, no! Are these people brainless? Is stupidity malignant? Cuomo will rightly hit the roof when they all begin clogging up NYC’s hospitals &amp; burning out med. staff again. Cuomo needs the natl. guard to LAY DOWN THE LAW, dammit.
1312502645014196226 2020-10-04 05:19:50 +0800 <Sailfish157> And you are a hateful man. I cannot wait for the day when Florida throws you out on your hateful, ugly ear.
1312502378260692993 2020-10-04 05:18:46 +0800 <Sailfish157> You can barely look at this emaciated, 3-mo puppy named CHARMY. She is literally skin and bones. Please RETWEET this small shred of life, CHARMY, so she will find a loving group to help her grow big &amp; healthy. ‘pledge $10.
1312501784749899776 2020-10-04 05:16:25 +0800 <Sailfish157> A DO carries as much weight as an MD in a hospital and w/every health insurer in US! He’s just not a very good doctor. Just the way Trump likes’m.
1312501331442069504 2020-10-04 05:14:37 +0800 <Sailfish157> Then today your work is done. Well done! It’s about time they ate some of their own nasty snarling.
1312501050612477952 2020-10-04 05:13:30 +0800 <Sailfish157> No sh&amp;t.
1312500951572381696 2020-10-04 05:13:06 +0800 <Sailfish157> And don’t forget this nugget: Pope refuses to meet with Pompeo until after the election. You bet we are choking on our schadenfreude &amp; praying the SC nomination hits skids so GOP won’t get to take my ACA care away. ps We just can’t say this out loud or we are as bad as he is.
1312479444167135233 2020-10-04 03:47:38 +0800 <Sailfish157> In Rose Garden video of 9/26, you see Kellyanne leaning in close to Barr as if to tell him a secret. Some secret.
1312479045108420608 2020-10-04 03:46:03 +0800 <Sailfish157> @maddow Maybe it’s ghoulish of me to want a daily tally of GOP-covid-positive names. But their SC nominee will, if voted in, vy likely vote down ACA care, and it’s all I have.(I am 62 w/out job.) Thank you!
1312469550529560577 2020-10-04 03:08:20 +0800 <Sailfish157> @maddow Rachel, pls assemble, in backgrnd of yr show, a running tally of people testing positive. Christie is latest addition, but Rick Scott is unclear. He said he was positive this am, then recanted later....? Thank U! xxx ooo

1312426963341127681 2020-10-04 00:19:06 +0800 <Sailfish157> @maddow And be cute with oxygen.  But then, who else would Trump pick for his MD?
1312426647216435201 2020-10-04 00:17:51 +0800 <Sailfish157> Yes. And Kellyanne whispered in his ear. No kidding. No joke. But I want to know if the old buzzard fr Kentucky was there. I dodn’t see him.

1312240557989793794 2020-10-03 11:58:23 +0800 <Sailfish157> @AlexMillerNews @Newsy And three reporters also in attendance at ceremony. Not to mention guest of honor, who had Covid this summer. An MD on Laurence O’Donnell said that some former Covid pts have been known to “shed the virus”, ie, spread it, a while after they were over it.

1312109820317630464 2020-10-03 03:18:53 +0800 <Sailfish157> The GOP certainly is in line for the balla-busta award of them alk:  2020’s IgNOBEL Prize (it exists).

It ends like this instead??
1312107197740933123 2020-10-03 03:08:28 +0800 <Sailfish157> But who gets last laugh?

Positives are at 0.8%. The pie chart says the rest of the field is “98.2%”. Wouldn’t it be “99.2%” if the positives are only at 0.8%?

Please RETWEET them so that maybe some group that can do it will take them. I don’t think they are bonded. ‘pledge $10 each for AGNES and CAPULINA.

1306707773154119682 2020-09-18 05:33:05 +0800 <Sailfish157> @ginachron I get the sense these kill palaces are playing all of us. They announce the killings on Thursday so as to get us moving by Friday. The San Antonio TX public pound put us thru this for three dogs today! erghhh!
1306706590527967232 2020-09-18 05:28:23 +0800 <Sailfish157> @ginachron Yes! Is he still aluve, do you think?
1306698861822517248 2020-09-18 04:57:40 +0800 <Sailfish157> He TESTED POSITIVE??? I heard this pm that he was exposed to a Covid+ person yesterday and was told to quarantine til 9/29-30.But he tested positive??
1306698236720287744 2020-09-18 04:55:11 +0800 <Sailfish157> Good news!

1306697686972801025 2020-09-18 04:53:00 +0800 <Sailfish157> He is unfit to live, as far as I’m concerned, given what he perpetrated on 200K innocent people.
1306697115863834630 2020-09-18 04:50:44 +0800 <Sailfish157> @chipfranklin What he did to Muskie was from the Trump playbook.... and all that other slimy stuff Segretti et al did to other democrats running for office. But yes, even Nixon knew how to keep his pants zipped up—politically speaking.
1306696258069897217 2020-09-18 04:47:19 +0800 <Sailfish157> @bostonherald Awful. Awful that eight hundred sixty thousand more Americans are waking up to no pay and no health insurance. While Mitch McConnell warms his ass on top of the 2nd stimulus bill he has had in his do-nothing inbox since MAY!
1306695562859872257 2020-09-18 04:44:34 +0800 <Sailfish157> Then she ain’t helping the boss. What a twit.

1306693939588718592 2020-09-18 04:38:07 +0800 <Sailfish157> @ErieNotEerie The many many many millions he is sitting on helps. As do a lot of Stepford voters in KY he has bamboozled. But if there is one thing we all learned in ‘16, a poll is not to be trusted.

1306688355485261835 2020-09-18 04:15:55 +0800 <Sailfish157> Well, since it is likely they aren’t mask wearers, it may not be as much of a worry as one would think.

UNLESS (&amp; no one on the right seems to have heard this) every air-breathing human dons a mask and keeps it on when inside near people. Mask is more effective than a vacc in stopping the wild fire spread, said CDC honcho yesterday.

1306673478016339971 2020-09-18 03:16:48 +0800 <Sailfish157> Georgie is a sweetheart! A pledge of a few dollars or any amount will urge others to follow suit! If Udon’t already know, pledge money goes to rescue groups who take the dogs. Pledge money = gas for transport, food, vet visits, &amp; so on. Groups find fosterers for training, etc! xo

1305163777600622592 2020-09-13 23:17:48 +0800 <Sailfish157> BENNI sits in a ragged cell at Carson hi kill (LA, CA) and trembles. The soundtrack in that place is one reason.

1304878279619489798 2020-09-13 04:23:19 +0800 <Sailfish157> Yes, but if that’s so—that it got sat on instead of spent—how to account for the big positive effect of spending on US economy? Since we lost $600/wk payments, economy is back to sluggish. There was method to the supposed madness in parceling out that dough.

If you know but refuse to warn your own people about a DEADLY virus, then spend many months watching them die, U R a goddamn sadistic monster.
1304095975183724545 2020-09-11 00:34:44 +0800 <Sailfish157> And who do not then mock you for social distancing and mask wearing. That is sadism!

1304081164123222018 2020-09-10 23:35:52 +0800 <Sailfish157> Right. I think that is the #1 sign we have a sociopath running our country into the ground. He is a monster and he must be removed from office, however forcibly, today. He is a bigger threat to us than covid and Putin out together.  https://t.co/mLj4XFlEZa

1304077199276998657 2020-09-10 23:20:07 +0800 <Sailfish157> Yes, it’s true. Thank you, US Senate for lending a helping hand. You’re as bad as Trump for failing to lift a finger. @USSenate
1304076686464557057 2020-09-10 23:18:05 +0800 <Sailfish157> I too hear Schiff’s words that memorable night he addressed the Senate during Trump’s impeachment!

1304075696508149761 2020-09-10 23:14:09 +0800 <Sailfish157> I know it. I wish I knew exactly when he told Woodward he knew how deadly the virus is. Woodward had a moral if not legal obligation to warn America &amp; the world.

1304074275960348672 2020-09-10 23:08:30 +0800 <Sailfish157> What I find pure evil is his knowledge of the deadliness of Covid even as he mocks people who wear masks. Donald Trump is a sadistic killer.

1303785911545724929 2020-09-10 04:02:39 +0800 <Sailfish157> BEV is a dog in great pain at San Antonio hi-fast kill. She has a bone bone break but unknown where—shelter hasn’t x-rayed her (!).

1303717189846011905 2020-09-09 23:29:34 +0800 <Sailfish157> @john_jseagraves Twitter works best for people who are hugely curious about lots of different things. Me? rescuing dogs; politics; passenger trains; writers. The more you look out, the more that comes back, oddly enuf.

And what makes it a whole lot harder is the political climate, fear of Covid, fear of having to adapt to a post-Covid. I see myself drinking too many Bud Lites cuz I am a nervous wreck, &amp; I gotta knock it off. It’s hard, Jodi.
1303702162040655874 2020-09-09 22:29:51 +0800 <Sailfish157> QUICK is SAFE!!!! YAY!!! He looks a lot happier in his freedom carrier, if a bit scrunched in there.
