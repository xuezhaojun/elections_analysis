1337286154824126465 2020-12-11 14:40:39 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @GreatestTrek Based on this tweet, I’m all in:
1337082709836001281 2020-12-11 01:12:14 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @edgar_a_bitch Bezos' insane wealth accumulation was best illustrated when someone calculated that he could give each of his employees a $105,000 bonus, and be as rich as pre-pandemic. "Wow," I thought, "I didn't realize Amazon has so few employees." It doesn't. It has 876,000 employees.
1337066854284746752 2020-12-11 00:09:14 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> According to an Israeli former space security chief, there's a Galactic Federation out there (which Trump knows about), but we're not yet ready. Here's why.

1336785016723025920 2020-12-10 05:29:18 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @dieDoktor I tried, but it says that "passw0rd" is too much like my current password. I mean how different do they want it to be?!?

1336742399213760514 2020-12-10 02:39:58 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @WillJorSaund @youwaitedtables @shoe0nhead Again, you're making a good case for this being plausible, but not for it being true. This is all circumstantial evidence.
1336640616235757569 2020-12-09 19:55:31 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @WillJorSaund @youwaitedtables @shoe0nhead What made me skeptical was that I had already found an explanation for why the smoke could be green (that quote I gave says that the chemical can produce green or white smoke), and then you gave me an alternative reason for why it'd be green, unrelated to the chemical being used.
1336639894689640452 2020-12-09 19:52:39 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @WillJorSaund @youwaitedtables @shoe0nhead Where's "here"? Also, helicopters, where did they come from? At this point, I'm somewhat sold on the plausible part, but still uncertain about the truth of it. This is a pretty wild claim to me, and as they say, extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.
1336639000124280832 2020-12-09 19:49:05 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @TehRealWaldo @WillJorSaund @youwaitedtables @shoe0nhead I'm generally still on the "sounds legit" train. It's the "is legit" part I'm trying to assess.
1336585070547783680 2020-12-09 16:14:48 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @WillJorSaund @youwaitedtables @shoe0nhead Now I’m more skeptical again... My quote explains the green color, so no need for signaling grenades. You also mention unidentified “distant observers” and “making poisoning pretty” both of which conjure up grotesquely exaggerated movie villains. You also quote no source.
1336559229654732800 2020-12-09 14:32:07 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @megaman_zer0 @shoe0nhead The article looks quite detailed and not written in the style of a propaganda piece. Of course, that doesn’t make it true. I’d love it if some reputable source could fact check this, because if it’s true, it sounds  pretty horrific.
1336558446251044866 2020-12-09 14:29:00 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @megaman_zer0 @shoe0nhead Googled the headline and found it:  https://t.co/uI274lKtFo
1336557767478419457 2020-12-09 14:26:18 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @youwaitedtables @shoe0nhead I don’t know much about chemistry, but I’d like to think I’m good at spotting propaganda. If this story is false, they put an unusual amount of work into making it seem true. If it’s true, it’s deeply troubling.
1336556500341370891 2020-12-09 14:21:16 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @youwaitedtables @shoe0nhead And here’s what it says about the chemical specifically: “Canisters collected from protest areas contained [...] hexachloroethane (commonly HC), a white powder that, when heated in the presence of metal salts, reacts to form a dense cloud of green or white smoke [...].”
1336555822277664768 2020-12-09 14:18:34 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @youwaitedtables @shoe0nhead Here’s the source:  https://t.co/uI274lKtFo

They apparently thought that the polarization itself should be stimulated.
1335312478239076355 2020-12-06 03:57:58 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @travis_view It was the same with Trump's 2016 win. It was the Electoral College! The Russians! Social media! Comey! Sure, all of these may have gotten him past the finish line. But the fact that he got anywhere _near_ the presidency in the first place was, and remains, the real problem.

His dad kept him afloat.

Ze zijn ook onverwacht effectief: men hoopte 50% van de tijd, het blijkt 90%+ te zijn. Misschien is het licht aan het einde van de tunnel moeilijk te geloven?

This is the correct answer: go first, put a plate dead center, and from then on just mirror the other player’s move. The sizes of the plates and table are a red herring: they don’t affect the riddle in any way.

1328218547525398529 2020-11-16 14:09:13 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @DocAtCDI You and a friend have round plates 12” across, and a round table 6’4” across. You take turns putting one plate anywhere on the table, so long as it’s not on top of another plate. The first person who can’t put a plate on the table anymore loses. How do you win? Do you go first?

1316009869867061253 2020-10-13 21:36:17 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @AntiProfessor @wmarybeard Why would knowledge of Latin qualify you to weigh in on how English words are pluralized? The plural of “museum” in Latin is “musea” (at least in the nominative) but in English it’s “museums.” Why? Because English people are not ancient Romans.

Jij hebt een vermoeden, en ik ook. Wat nu?
1314210726781698051 2020-10-08 22:27:08 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @doarproatlub Er zijn sinds dit begon, voorzover we weten, 150.000 mensen besmet. Dat is 0,9% van de bevolking. Stel dat we daar met een factor 10 naast zitten. Dan is het 9%. Groepsimmuniteit vereist 60-75%. Dus hoe die "bijna is bereikt" --dat zie ik niet zo gauw.

It's possible that he doesn't have it. Just like it was possible 5 days ago. My point: still believing it is a matter of degree, not kind. The logic is flawed in both cases.

What I would like is for Trump to have a brush with death, reassess his life,   renounce his ways, drop out of the race and enter a Buddhist monastery.

And now reality and facts have finally caught up with him, in a way that he cannot deny, avoid or talk his way out of.
1312152291932135424 2020-10-03 06:07:39 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @anoncatanoncat Does the Biden campaign have ads about Trump that are _not_ negative?
1312151639839576065 2020-10-03 06:05:04 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @fr_brennan I love how "research" means that QAnons twist themselves into a pretzel doing advanced math to connect Obama or Hillary to some obscure demonic number (rounded up to the nearest integer), but shrug about the fact that Trump's son-in-law owns 666 Fifth Avenue.
1312149741396848640 2020-10-03 05:57:31 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @Caelrie @noahjnelson @Popehat Right. Truth: "Tonight, FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19." Half-truth: "We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately." (Who knows if he'll recover?) Lie: "We will get through this TOGETHER!"

1312110649917411328 2020-10-03 03:22:11 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @Caelrie @noahjnelson @Popehat I doubt that _literally_ over 50% of what Trump says is lies. Apart from that, fact-checking is not math. If he said, "I was in Minnesota on Wednesday," it'd be wrong to outright disbelieve him even if he tells more lies than truths.
1312097173987876867 2020-10-03 02:28:38 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @Caelrie @noahjnelson @Popehat And on what basis do you conclude that it's more likely that he's lying than that he's telling the truth? And it's not just him, mind you; it's everyone else in the know as well, like Melania or his doctor.

1311984550319403008 2020-10-02 19:01:06 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @Caelrie @noahjnelson @Popehat The reason we know he lies in those cases is because his statements are proven to be false. If you have proof he's not infected, obviously he's lying. But you can't infer from the fact that he lies all the time that he _must_ be lying now.
1311983684392816640 2020-10-02 18:57:40 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @koemanpeter @lucoggel Veel logischer, ze kunnen mekaar toch niet luchten of zien.
1311902026075340801 2020-10-02 13:33:11 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @Caelrie @noahjnelson @Popehat The fault in the reasoning is not that Trump couldn’t be lying, it’s that Trump lying would be more likely than him actually getting sick. That latter explanation requires fewer assumptions and therefore is more likely to be true.

It was created by 4chan user "Hotwheels" who abandoned it and is trying to destroy it. It's now run by Jim Watkins, a guy living in the Philippines, and his son. Some speculate that Q's posts are now written by the son.

When he was still on 4chan, you could identify Q by his "tripcode" - basically a code that's unique like a username, see  https://t.co/5BL1j3Gk2W - but one, tripcodes can be hacked, and two, Q moved to 8chan, so who knows if it's still the same user.

Jaren later zat ooit in een restaurant waar bij wijze decor een oude encyclopedie in de boekenkast stond. Op de rug van een van de kalfslederen banden stond: "Moo - Orl"

1305876645451046913 2020-09-15 22:30:28 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @lucoggel Ja, gestoord dat wie onambigue, glasheldere richtlijnen overtreedt, toch na de 100% voorspelbare gevolgen met vage excuses in de krant mag (hij moet nog wennen, hij is pas 2 weken geleden 2 geworden). De Telegraaf is normaal toch van law &amp; order? Regels zijn regels.

Violent, child-like and stupid: the trifecta of racist stereotypes.

Kom op zeg, een hippe tent moet wel inkopen bij op z'n minst de Marqt, en eigenlijk bij de organische Baskisch/West-Mongoolse toko om de hoek.

Torres: Sylvia Plath’s “The Bell Jar”. Doctor: RL Stevenson’s “Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.” Tuvok: Plato. Chakotay: Carlos Fuentes’ “The Good Conscience.” Paris: “Flying The Edge,” apparently a book about piloting planes.

1300781954598686721 2020-09-01 21:05:59 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @LauraBeljaars Helemaal mee eens. Ik denk dat het van beide kanten helpt om ervan uit te gaan dat de ander te goeder trouw is. Dat betekent ook dat beide opemerkingen wat mij betreft volkomen gerechtvaardigd kunnen zijn... zolang ze maar ergens toe leiden, zoals je zegt.
1300734831651889152 2020-09-01 17:58:45 +0800 <mpanhuijsen> @LauraBeljaars Ik denk dat het mes aan twee kanten snijdt. Zowel "Zo bedoelde ik het niet" als "Je hebt me gekwetst" kunnen oprecht én onoprecht gebruikt worden. Beide zijn ook niet bijster constructief--wat moet de andere partij precies met deze informatie doen?
