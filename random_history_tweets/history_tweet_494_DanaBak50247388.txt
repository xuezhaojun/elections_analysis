1337986763025997827 2020-12-13 13:04:37 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @CooperNeese Terrific game at Purdue today. A very underrated player and I hope you have a great year. Be great, and be humble. Serve God!!
1333876403067101190 2020-12-02 04:51:31 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @clubtrillion Maybe they could keep doing 2 line layup dunk drills. Wtf?  All athletes, blah, blah, blah. How about the name of the game?  Shooting the ball.....Their pregame is a joke.
1327333056521400320 2020-11-14 03:30:35 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @WhitlockJason @ClayTravis So true. So accurate. Candice Owen's constantly hammers the point home when she says, "We are the only culture that CELEBRATES criminals, and criminal activity. A badge of honor and respect". Not much of a chance for kids to shine in this culture, unless it's sports, rap, crime.
1326906609193390081 2020-11-12 23:16:03 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> We just need a strong man and woman to stand up behind President Trump. He needs us, NOW.
1326613850662297601 2020-11-12 03:52:43 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> And they literally don't see the hypocrisy. They are incapable of any truth or logic.
1326560110395658240 2020-11-12 00:19:11 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @Joy17123083 @larryelder Uh, all you EVER needed to know was before the election, if you went to blm website, you were redirected to the Biden campaign site. Just follow that dirty money. They paid MILLIONS for their votes. Sickening.
1326244559148421121 2020-11-11 03:25:17 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> Wow.
1326243900244316162 2020-11-11 03:22:40 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @Outkick @ClayTravis It's the liberal way. Don't get want we want? VIOLENCE. And that, my friends is what separates Republicans from the Dems. And they are counting on us rolling over like little wimps. Remember, they were going to "burn it all down" if ACB was appointed. It's all they know. Sad.

It will be Joe's last gift to America, to help Dems win." Or some shit like that. But, they have NO intention of letting this man be President. It's a real sick show. 😡

1323394514053193729 2020-11-03 06:40:14 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @JackPosobiec I remember when Meathead tweeted this on September 29th, after the first "debate". Biden stood up for 90 mins without falling over. Sadly, that was their only criteria for their candidate. I hope he chokes on this tweet.  https://t.co/4D8hAgx7Y6

They will NOT judge what anyone else does, even if it's wrong. They've been trained to keep quiet, or be called names, ostracized, or worse. I've noticed this trend for years. As long as you don't hurt me, it's ok.🤮

No one said a SINGLE WORD about it. Open racism, open season against white males, so it's all good. No MSM since March.😡😡

The fact that they openly cheat, lie, swindle, have MSM in their pockets, etc and don't care who knows it. They just lie, get caught, shrug their shoulders, and move right on to the next lie. And no one seems to care except us. 😡😡😳😳
1319096798615666689 2020-10-22 10:02:39 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @lisa_furmama I'm a woman. 58. It changes as you get older, and you realize that looks can be fleeting. But, true empowerment, should be character related. I mean, anyone can flash their boobs, or bikini bods, but then what? Life doesn't develop character, it REVEALS your TRUE character. 🙂💖

1319015325862682633 2020-10-22 04:38:54 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @chuckwoolery But he has tweeted repeatedly that "If I'm elected President, I will WORK EVERY DAY for you". What a joke.

Maybe this is why in our area, whenever we are out and about, at least 75% of the black men we see, are with white women. I know some people love the bigger girls. It's all good, but I know what we see, too. Racism isn't the problem. Maybe you?🥴

And when someone takes home a pet, depending on the age, it can be a long process to settle in for the animal. Most people just give up. Imagine you go to new home, new people. Do I get food?

Found out yesterday that our beloved rescue hound, Oakley, has terminal cancer, no remedy. She has maybe a month. We've had her 8 years. All dogs deserve a forever home, with loving parents. We love ours so much. 😥❤❤💖  https://t.co/0TbnzB9jQ4

1313280463042236416 2020-10-06 08:50:36 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @Debmoley But, Biden has Ludacris and peeps making a video. And Harris wore Timba boots. If you "racial jungle" people don't vote Biden, "you ain't black". Dems hope to keep you in the chains of welfare, forever. Pres Trump wants to bring economic development, jobs, and power to you. 🇺🇲🤔

1309967292034363398 2020-09-27 05:25:15 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @Rockprincess818 When you plan to win by CHEATING with ballot harvesting, blocking voters at polls, throwing Trump ballots away, and other nefarious plans....you don't have to campaign. Look at Madison, WI. Next 2 Saturdays. 200 parks. Ballot Harvesting. Sponsered by BIDEN CAMPAIGN. FACT. 😡😡😡

So now, the ballot rulings are going their way. Illegally, of course, but they plan to cheat all the way. That's why BIDEN doesn't campaign. They are gonna cheat by ballot harvest.

They don't give a damn about the police, but you can bet they will call them, for help, if robbed, hurt, etc. They are absolutely COMPLICIT with the violence against LEO. 😡😡

I would like to add/bring back DODGEBALL. Gym class was a place where scores were settled, aggression released, and then we went to lunch and moved on with our lives. Now, crap builds up, and you get mass shootings. 🥴🇺🇲

It's a sad thing. And it just keeps repeating itself  because EMOTION outweighs rational thinking with this group. Maybe someday....🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲👊👊👊
1308451311084396546 2020-09-23 01:01:17 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @realDonaldTrump Get ready for the "Dims" catchphrase, "LET ME BE CLEAR". Using it to sound important. Obama used it non-stop. Now they parrot. 🤢🤢🤮🤮😡😡
1308450737677008897 2020-09-23 00:59:00 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @ChuckCallesto Should be MAJOR time limits on welfare anyhow. Welfare was designed to give someone help during a rough patch. It wasn't designed to become a LIFESTYLE. But, for millions, that's what it has become.

For example, I wish they could teach ABSTINENCE. Also, MANNERS. Because we clearly can't count on most of the parents to teach it. They just wanna be buddies. Got more, but that's enough to chew on.

How many blacks we got? 🤮

As soon as they graduate, they say, "I've worked here 3 whole months, I should be CEO by now". No concept of starting at the bottom, respectfully, and working your way up, over years.
1308206327924129792 2020-09-22 08:47:48 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @seanhannity Their statements mean NOTHING, and they accomplish NOTHING. The only thing it does, is divide the country in 2 sides.

Also, so hard to counteract 2 or 3 gens of crappy parenting. These young white girls are a mess. I blame the Kardashians and social media, too. Sadly, I'm serious. Family culture, gone. 🤢🤮🥴

He is being held hostage by his white guilt and was forced to scream "black lives matter" repeatedly, on national television. I didn't watch, but saw a clip. He's a mess, but he gets what he deserves. Can you help him? Terrorists have him. 🥴
1308071916742365185 2020-09-21 23:53:42 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @stillgray There are no boundaries anymore. Every child has been treated like equals with the adults since the day they were born. Never told NO, never made to wait, never held accountable, never had consequences. Throw in the Kardashians, and social media 24/7 and the culture is ruined. 😡
1308070663178063880 2020-09-21 23:48:43 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @stillgray My son keeps telling me we just can't relate to all of the problems this generation is going through. Ex: We have to work if we want money, pay taxes, student loans, and insurance. And it's Trump's fault. We said, "Are u fucking kidding?" Clearly, we have been shitty parents. 🥴

But, make no mistake, this shit needs to stop. This is a HORRIBLE story, on every level. Stop negotiating with terrorists. These people have NO CONSCIENCE. 😡😡😡😡😡
1308060274415538176 2020-09-21 23:07:26 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @bonnievanasse They do NOTHING to help the areas they were elected to represent. Working on Homeless, welfare, building, roads, jobs, etc? Nope. Just 3 1/2 years of non-stop harassment of Pres Trump. It's sickening, and criminal. They should be removed. They don't deserve to hold an office. 😡

BUT, he went to the doctor first. She gave him a medication, in very small dosage of an anti-depressant. It helped him alot. Don't know how it works for all, but GO TO YOUR DOCTOR.

1307950783930007552 2020-09-21 15:52:22 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @CompletelyUp They have spent over 3 1/2 years doing NOTHING constructive for their constitutes. Instead, they use every waking moment to threaten, and do everything in their power to mess with Pres Trump. None of them deserve another term. They are robbing the American people. Unconscionable.

And...their 3 kids are little buttholes. We have conservative fam, too. They discipline harder, with consequences. Their kids are a dream, usually. And if they act up, they pay the piper. 👊🇺🇲👊🇺🇲👊

That's why you can't have a discussion with them. Their way is the only way, or pouts and tantrums. Their arrogance is offensive and unwarranted. 🥴😡

It's actually an old speakers trick to purvey a sense of importance, or power. Guess who rode this trick all the way to WH? Yep, their mentor, Obama. Biden, Harris, use it non-stop. 🤢🤮

Still had to work, shop, raise kids, take care of home, pay bills. Stuff regular, productive contributors to society do each day. No time to whine, riot, protest, etc. Had to work.

Either way, the problem is the criminals, not the cops, 99.95% of the time. The narrative of hunting blacks is the most ignorant thing spinning in this country. It is a total cop out for lawless fools. 😡😡
1307388214001500162 2020-09-20 02:36:54 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @realredtarget So there are radicals piling up at McConnell's house. Since open threats have been made on his life, ANYONE who shows up there should be considered a threat and arrested, IMMEDIATELY.

1306408304122494976 2020-09-17 09:43:06 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @stclairashley Simply a classic, textbook liberal. Irrational, emotional, hates America, secretly hates themselves, and contributes nothing but chaos, turmoil, and division to this country. There is no reasoning with these people. Like talking to a TODDLER. Dont get what they want? TANTRUMS! 🤮
1306386281958699009 2020-09-17 08:15:35 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @Mamacita4life It's all there. The keys to accountability and becoming a responsible person. Add in some love, empathy, compassion, and a heart to serve others, and you'd have an awesome person!! The biggie is the word NO, and the fact that the world does NOT revolve around you. Great stuff! ❤
1306374790102618113 2020-09-17 07:29:55 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @WhitlockJason Yep. But, let's not let facts get in the way of the narrative. A black guy got shot by a cop. That's all they need to know. The cop was hunting black men and randomly shot him. That's the narrative. The fact that he's a lifetime banger doing drive-bys is irrelevant. Disgusting.😡

Just as a hospital is for sick people, a church is for sinners. If we weren't sinners, we wouldn't need Jesus. Sinners come to the Lord for healing and FORGIVENESS. Thank you God!! 🙏❤

But, they chose to divide, and have encouraged this kind of behavior. They have told their culture it's ok to resist and hurt cops. Sick.
1305272283888529409 2020-09-14 06:28:57 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @WhitlockJason Hate to say it, but Brady was done last year. When they ran out on the field for last year's opener, Brady led the team out. After a few steps, the MASCOT, with the giant head, blew right by Brady like he was in quicksand. I saw that, and knew. FATHER TIME IS UNDEFEATED!! 🏈

They literally chose every possible path to DIVIDE. They blew it. These are not leaders. Leaders find a way to unite. There is zero strong leadership in pro sports. Not one strong man among them. 😡👎

It was planned, and then they blocked the ER so the cops couldn't get help. They believe there are no repercussions for this. And, they have millions applauding this horrific act. THEY CELEBRATE THE CRIMINAL. Sick, sick, sick.😡

Many, or most of the people who commit some of the most heinous crimes have the DARKEST EYES. Just dead or cold looking. No empathy or humanity in them. It seems like a real thing. I wonder how that happens? 🥴😕

Nothing but backtracking and "gotcha" questions. Dying to be the big cheese, by getting the President. The disrespect is repulsive.

The result, social engineering and kid's brains being inundated with things young kids shouldn't be seeing. They want it all normalized. And then, there's no going back. It's a terrible mess.

I choose to avoid them. Same with any other people.

And I'm not kidding. 😡😡 Welcome to,  "bend over backwards world". We wouldn't want to hurt anybody's feelings. Sports have become a joke. 👎🤢🤮
1303544151485579264 2020-09-09 12:01:59 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @queenalmamarie The irony, and the problem, is all here. Notice what they think is important. Literally didn't mention a single ESSENTIAL worker. What are the singers and dancers gonna do when farmers stop growing food? Stores close? Truckers stop delivering? Values of this culture are askew. 🥴
1303508126453374977 2020-09-09 09:38:50 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @GSBn10UC @GrantB911 You're probably right. And in today's climate of resisting at all costs, you need about 10 guys to take someone down. I mean, there were several dudes getting on the guy. I noticed someone mentioned the knee to the neck by one of them. So many drugs and many guys are insane. Idk.
1303506076005019649 2020-09-09 09:30:41 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @PISDI94_96 Agreed. I do feel sorry for arena/stadium employees that make their living on concession sales, and ushering, etc. But, the coaches, and players. I got nuthin for them. Same for upcoming @NFL as they excitedly plan their kneeling ceremonies. Means nothing, helps no one. #America

1303476654002577409 2020-09-09 07:33:46 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @kingron_b They think, that any successful black person, only got that way, by kissing the "man's" ass. The only respectable occupations, for the culture, are: Pro athlete, actor, rapper/music, or gangster. They hate anyone who WORKS every day, in a noble profession, and LEO. It's so sad.

People used to have self-respect, and a moral compass. Now, it's a free for all. You are what you really are when nobody's looking. In this case, they don't care if they're seen. 🥴

Because we have to go to work, EVERY DAY. We pay our own way. Don't have time to riot and carry on, 24/7. It's really that simple. Idle hands and idle minds...👎👎

Just imagine if you were genuinely happy for friends or family when something good happens, or they win, get accolades, or accomplish something, big or small. Instead of envy and resentment, be happy. It feels good. But, human (sinful) nature says no.

The really bad part is how everyone congratulated him online, and celebrated his status. I can't remember whether it was 6 or 7 girls. But, of course he headed to college.

These hypocrites are mentally ill with TDS to the point that they will do anything to disrespect the POTUS. I've never seen anything like this. It is sickening and so unconscionable I have no words harsh enough. 😡

Finally, the numbers of white players can go up, to reflect the percentage of the population, accordingly. Oh, wait, it only applies to blacks, right? The fact that YOU DO ANYTHING based on race, makes you a racist. #NoNFL
1300972884328878080 2020-09-02 09:44:41 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @tedcruz It's not UNACCEPTABLE. It's CRIMINAL. My God, what is happening here? It's vandalism, trespassing, and maybe terrorism.

Call us racist all day long. It won't work on us, anymore. Anything they don't like, or agree with, racist. White supremacist. I CAN'T HEAR YOU, ANYMORE. But, I see you.

Or just white male supporting POTUS. Especially racist if: they go to work, raise a family, have a home, follow the law, legally own firearms, pay taxes, and support police. Sad. 🥴

1300630137558499329 2020-09-01 11:02:43 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @JeffStJohn18 @atensnut Was hoping for some assistance. Idk them very well. Ted Bundy was somewhere in Florida, too, I think. I only remembered Dahmer in Milwaukee. Like I said, I'm sure each team could find a local "hero". It's a sad world, huh? Thanks for the info!🙂🇺🇲👊
1300627523475251200 2020-09-01 10:52:20 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @fullofshitzu That's 2 people for each pizza he brought!! 3 pizzas is all they needed. Overwhelmed the pizza joint with their order. Probably didn't tip. 🙈🙉🙊

1300625815084953600 2020-09-01 10:45:33 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @Tommymac1711 @LeahR77 It's part of the plan. Just overwhelm law enforcement. Just think of all the crimes in the past week. Just keep creating chaos. Then, the Dem mayors let them back out of jail to do it again. It's horrific. Some really bad people out there pulling strings. 😡
1300624418499178502 2020-09-01 10:40:00 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @queenalmamarie Hey, we ALL need more GOOD friends. Tonight my husband tried to talk to people 4 or 5 times at the store. Only one person, spoke at all. Everyone seemed like freakin zombies. I think they were too shocked to speak back. Very sad. We tried. Maybe it's us? 🥴

1300622691603492864 2020-09-01 10:33:08 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @KathyVotesRed @albybrava "Trump did it. I saw the video, but I don't care. Trump did it because he's a racist. Um, yeah, he just is! I think Trump was driving the bus. That poor girl was peacefully protesting and a right-winger triggered the whole thing." -Joe Biden and Dems tomorrow
1300621162045673472 2020-09-01 10:27:04 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @ritlee83 @atensnut Oh crap, you're right. I guess I don't know my "heroes" very well. I was hoping somebody would chime in with other suggestions. I thought of Bundy, too, but idk where he "belongs", except in hell. Thanks for the correction. 🙂🇺🇲👊

1300612524598067202 2020-09-01 09:52:44 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @KassandraKitson If you don't have any consequences, or get right out of jail, this is what happens to truly morally bankrupt people. Their true character comes out. 😡😡

1300609495152963590 2020-09-01 09:40:42 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @Annakhait I don't want to say, because the SOB has been a liberal mouthpiece, and open Trump hater. So, I'm done with him and any others. Makes me sad, too. 🥴
1300609007971979264 2020-09-01 09:38:46 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @queenalmamarie Prayers for safety, clarity, and unity. 🙏🙏🇺🇲🇺🇲👊👊

1300607158434881537 2020-09-01 09:31:25 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @atensnut How about each city's most famous serial killer on their helmets? Like, the Bears could wear, (John Wayne Gacy), Patriots (Boston Strangler), Packers (Jeffery Dahmer), Seattle (BTK), etc. Honor those hometown heroes. NFL is morally bankrupt. Just looking for ONE STRONG MAN. Sad.
1300603138148380672 2020-09-01 09:15:26 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @Jim_Jordan Please ask them, "If President Trump is to blame, why did EVERY Governor and Mayor refuse his offer of help and sending the National Guard?" That's the only question you need to ask. But, you'll never hear it on MSM. 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲👊👊👊👊👊👊👊
1300598983648215040 2020-09-01 08:58:56 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @terilovestrump He's "counseling" NBA players on how to create trouble, hate whitey, and speak real smooth so it sounds like you're a hero. He hates America, just like these poor, mistreated players. They had a chance to unite this country. They've chosen to divide, and openly hate police. 😡🤮
1300597562249019403 2020-09-01 08:53:17 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @BigMikeObama21 @seanhannity Here's the simple question. IF THESE RIOTERS ARE TRUMPERS, THEN WHY DID EVERY DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR AND MAYOR TURN DOWN PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN HE ASKED TO SEND IN THE NATIONAL GUARD? They all refused his offer to help. That's all anyone needs to know. That's the truth. 😡😡
1300594004539715586 2020-09-01 08:39:09 +0800 <DanaBak50247388> @LeahR77 Saw a HARLEY RIDER headed down the highway, all alone, wearing a medical mask. Made me sad. 🥴 It's his right, and maybe it was for bugs. Idk. 😕
