1343523976375635971 2020-12-28 19:47:32 +0800 <doinggeography> @mcmadal I am not an expert at all, but the Breslau section is related to the German settlement part in Breslau; there is also a so-called hut in the Eastern Alps. But probably the section had quite a terrible history in Poland during the Nazi period, I'm afraid...  https://t.co/ijVAUqKiGU

1342798077963468802 2020-12-26 19:43:04 +0800 <doinggeography> @sher_khashimov Exactly. As a German, I have to mention the enormous amount of men from Central Asia who were killed in the Second World War - that has left enormous traces in Central Asian societies until today. The traumas have an impact right down to the grandchildren's generations.
1342769316085821440 2020-12-26 17:48:47 +0800 <doinggeography> @sher_khashimov @andersostlund Of course, I was sure you knew the book, the suggestion was meant for mediation. Indeed, there is still the truth of the relief that people felt when the persecutions and deportations finally stopped and gave hope for a good life. And this achievement must also be acknowledged.
1342767290954244099 2020-12-26 17:40:44 +0800 <doinggeography> @sher_khashimov @andersostlund I recommend for reading "Secondhand Time" by Svetlana Alexievich. I think that it makes no sense to devalue the many decades of also good life that people fought for under difficult circumstances by referring to the Gulag. The Gulag was a terrible crime, no question about it.

It is not the photos of the so-called Islamic culture that bring us closer to the people, for example, in Central Asia. These photos manly manifest the difference, the 'oriental other'. It is the scenes that show that there is generally not much difference between people.

I always need distance in order to gather strength and to be able to start over again. She is a very remarkable narrator.

Many did not understand why he played Hitler, many thought he made him into a caricature.

You get $17 per head if you have this card. Since IDPs are still living in the transitional shelters today, they urgently need this low sum. Medical care is for most of them out of reach.

1310667248672165888 2020-09-29 03:46:37 +0800 <doinggeography> @ODrachewych Yes, "Turksib" is such an extraordinary example, constructed in the same way as the film "Salt for Svaneti". Do you know the travel report of the German communist and journalist Egon Erwin Kisch from 1929? In general, the time of the first 5-year plan is a very exciting time...
1310665639934164994 2020-09-29 03:40:14 +0800 <doinggeography> @ODrachewych Thank you for your positive reply. I work on Svaneti in Georgia and was quite excited when I came across the text by Tretyakov.  It is of course only a small summary of quotations, but hopefully well readable - just as a little impulse...

1309714310306951168 2020-09-26 12:39:59 +0800 <doinggeography> @TonyWalsh_me @GilbreathDustin I tried to sketch this problem in the following text on @EurasiaNet - It also highlights the link between heritage conservation, poverty reduction and tourism  https://t.co/LrHon9lllj
1309695517044113411 2020-09-26 11:25:18 +0800 <doinggeography> @TonyWalsh_me @GilbreathDustin rightly reported on the possibility of overcoming poverty through tourism in Svaneti. Covid-19 is, of course, a step backwards in this respect.
1309695027921276930 2020-09-26 11:23:22 +0800 <doinggeography> @TonyWalsh_me You are right! That is why marketing refers to the whole region. The tourism industry simply claims a World Heritage status that does not exist in this form. But if there is a dispute with UNESCO about this, I think the bad press would have fatal consequences, cf.@GilbreathDustin
1309593928958726145 2020-09-26 04:41:38 +0800 <doinggeography> @TonyWalsh_me Georgia is unfortunately far from such opportunities. And there are very complex overlaps between traditional legal concepts and state law. In Svaneti, people have only few pre-Soviet legal documents on family property.

Ich wünsche Ihnen einen schönen Tag und dake für Ihre Anmerkungen! :)
1308294447495487490 2020-09-22 14:37:57 +0800 <doinggeography> @SchickerHanna Letztlich ist es das, was Reckwitz beschreibt, das die Maschine dort antreibt: Singularisierung, Affektintensivierung und Kuratierung des eigenen Selbst - das treibt die Blogs und Social-Media-accounts der Besucher schin lange an und die Menschen in der Region vor sich her...
1308293811685138432 2020-09-22 14:35:26 +0800 <doinggeography> @SchickerHanna 2019 hatte die Region 150.000 Besucher - die Walze rollt also, mit unserem Uni-Projekt versuchen wir zumindest die zu erreichen, die mehr Hintergrund wollen und Interesse an Nachhaltigkeit. Ich verstehe natürlich Ihren Punkt :) ich fürchte nur, dafür ist es schon zu spät...

All I am saying is that attention should be paid to these socio-economic relationships, which are not reflected in a poverty rate for the time being.

And then, within the next few years, the elderly will die, whose pensions are essential for the basic survival of most families,

At the same time, booking platforms such as booking are lowering the price of overnight stays.

There are increasing conflicts here. These lead to old-established inhabitants of Svaneti suddenly having competition.

Of course, I also see the problem in particular that there is no room in Svaneti for negotiating how to deal with its own cultural heritage. Therefore, as unfortunate as it is for Georgia, I do not expect that the World Heritage status can be maintained.
1307365782175862793 2020-09-20 01:07:46 +0800 <doinggeography> @HUL_heritage In a sense, this reconstruction was a revolt against the extermination campaign of Nazi Germany. This is why you can immediately find prefabricated concrete slab buildings behind the inner ring in the cities.
1307365432203055107 2020-09-20 01:06:23 +0800 <doinggeography> @HUL_heritage It is really shocking. On the retreat, the German army destroyed the Polish old towns along several axes by using firecrackers. The Poles rebuilt them after the 2nd World War, i.e. these old towns are not historical in the strict sense.

In other words, competition for resources is increasing.

1307363289807097856 2020-09-20 00:57:52 +0800 <doinggeography> @GilbreathDustin @niels13janssen @onewmphoto There is a specific additional problem in Svaneti: when tourists arrived, since about 2010, they entered a socio-economic system in which one person, in relation to the tourists, had more land resources, i.e. more livestock, more pasture, more buildings that could become hostels.
1307362585986072582 2020-09-20 00:55:04 +0800 <doinggeography> @GilbreathDustin @niels13janssen @onewmphoto It definitely means less poverty in the first place - for a selection of households living on the Mestia Ushguli axis, you are absolutely right and I support your figures - but I work qualitatively-reconstructively and ethnographically.

1304997811503722496 2020-09-13 12:18:18 +0800 <doinggeography> @karolina_anna1 No matter how much one may write about Alfred Nobel's 'productive' conflict with the socialist Berta von Suttner which led to the Peace Prize - the family tradition remained the same: the Nobels remained "merchants of death".
1304997571325308928 2020-09-13 12:17:21 +0800 <doinggeography> @karolina_anna1 Unfortunately, the history of patriarchy teaches us to forget the evil deeds of men. The Nobel family became rich with oil, explosives and weapons - ultimately with the war.

1303424352248115201 2020-09-09 04:05:56 +0800 <doinggeography> @Traceculture @Bertrom 😀 Rickmers really worked like an ethnographer. But even more exciting is the story of the female mountaineer who accompanied him - Cenzi von Ficker. For her achievements in mountaineering, she received Mount Ushba, symbolically as a gift from the last feudal lord of Svaneti.
