1327770983915155456 2020-11-15 08:30:46 +0800 <wittgenfine> In high school I really thought Alan Watts had all the answers and I still remember how black pilled I was when I found out he was a depressed suicidal alcoholic. Gurus really are the original grifters

1327702074075746305 2020-11-15 03:56:56 +0800 <wittgenfine> If you‚Äôre not commodifying your suffering by writing a book about it then are you really suffering?
1327697608287010817 2020-11-15 03:39:11 +0800 <wittgenfine> Sometimes I wish I had an addiction to crack it would be a lot easier to make excuses for myself

1327438950617628672 2020-11-14 10:31:23 +0800 <wittgenfine> Every great idea and all great truths are founded on mystery and secrets Godel formally proved this with his incompleteness theorem

1327330927173779457 2020-11-14 03:22:08 +0800 <wittgenfine> If someone says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for your loss‚Äù they are a narcissist people who genuinely feel sorry or bad just say ‚Äúsorry for your loss‚Äù
1327290185499824128 2020-11-14 00:40:14 +0800 <wittgenfine> I have a liberal arts degree in stand up comedy so if you don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm funny you‚Äôre an uneducated bigot
1327113185111928833 2020-11-13 12:56:54 +0800 <wittgenfine> @dendricide But That‚Äôs literally that‚Äôs what Buddhist monks have been saying forever though and it‚Äôs also a very easy and obvious concept. A more interesting refutation is that a truly ‚Äúfree will‚Äù would still be determined if God is free and he creates the universe then that‚Äôs determined
1327111510569537536 2020-11-13 12:50:15 +0800 <wittgenfine> @dendricide I just dislike that he thinks he‚Äôs a philosopher because he doesn‚Äôt believe in free will. His big brain blast is that If every cause has an effect than everything you do is caused by something else so you have no free will. Also he likes zen
1327105639391215616 2020-11-13 12:26:55 +0800 <wittgenfine> Does Sam Harris ever meditate on the fact that he is an unlikable insufferable brainlet incapable of interesting thought?
1327091220770816000 2020-11-13 11:29:37 +0800 <wittgenfine> Jung sipping on that go off juice: The fact that religious statements frequently conflict with the observed physical phenomena proves that in contrast to physical perception the spirit is autonomous, and that psychic experience is to a certain extent independent of physical data

1326995574147534848 2020-11-13 05:09:33 +0800 <wittgenfine> @magicianbrain @deltaveeee I‚Äôve been learning Python for the last 4-5 months and can write very basic functions does that count?

1326956129222471680 2020-11-13 02:32:49 +0800 <wittgenfine> Why do men volunteer to fight in war? Anyone who knows men know that there is an innate urge to do dumb shit to A. Get woman to notice us and B. Have the world remember us. Both sexes have the urge to leave behind a lasting legacy only one has the biological capabilities to do so
1326956127767171073 2020-11-13 02:32:49 +0800 <wittgenfine> Differences between men and woman come down to one thing for the most part Woman are able to leave a lasting impact by creating and raising children men can‚Äôt make babies so we have to find something to create in order to leave a legacy this also explains why gays make great art
1326940085032345603 2020-11-13 01:29:04 +0800 <wittgenfine> @magicianbrain Everyone is susceptible to coomer brain and I am no different. In other words ‚Äúhit or miss, I guess they never miss huh?‚Äù

1326689113089609730 2020-11-12 08:51:47 +0800 <wittgenfine> Was asked to repost my substack article on compression as intelligence. If anyone is interested here it is:  https://t.co/WfMLb3AOzC
1326660731303981056 2020-11-12 06:59:01 +0800 <wittgenfine> Flat earth society is just a group of guys who like flat chested little titty woman
1326658186951098368 2020-11-12 06:48:54 +0800 <wittgenfine> And I thought I put up emotional barriers
1326597507200086021 2020-11-12 02:47:47 +0800 <wittgenfine> You ever have those experiences in life where you remember the exact moment happening in a dream but then you‚Äôre not sure if you ever really had this dream. What mean?
1326591414117957632 2020-11-12 02:23:34 +0800 <wittgenfine> Wittgenstein was right most problems if not all are caused by misunderstanding either of language or of the problem what I like about coding is the necessity to define every input if you want to change you better have a definition of change and how it affects existing variables
1326583097052160001 2020-11-12 01:50:31 +0800 <wittgenfine> Your interior life and who you believe yourself to be Is the pool that Narcissus gets trapped looking in forever. Stop thinking about yourself, to think is to idealize but you are real not an ideal, these thoughts will only lead to paralysis and mental illness
1326566733549690880 2020-11-12 00:45:30 +0800 <wittgenfine> @magicianbrain Podcast and chill
1326565934996221952 2020-11-12 00:42:19 +0800 <wittgenfine> @magicianbrain When you‚Äôre too afraid to ask a girl out on a date so you ask her to start a podcast with you instead
1326564984701120513 2020-11-12 00:38:33 +0800 <wittgenfine> Sex? Is that like when you listen to a podcast with a girl?
1326396507235430401 2020-11-11 13:29:05 +0800 <wittgenfine> Don‚Äôt trust people and especially not their words all men wish they were better and project their fake better selves in to your psyche to make you feel inadequate but you‚Äôre fine and most people are idiots... also anyone who tells you they are a genius is not
1326340738821419008 2020-11-11 09:47:29 +0800 <wittgenfine> @WALMARTCHAD Because doing it while in power is suicide it would be incredibly destructive to the very institution that he is in charge of. You only tell your boss what you really think of him when you quit
1326333215536132096 2020-11-11 09:17:35 +0800 <wittgenfine> Remember to order from the secret menu at law school, if you recite the monologue from ‚ÄúA time to kill‚Äù or ‚ÄúA few good men‚Äù, they‚Äôll make your law degree animal style

1325182906025742345 2020-11-08 05:06:40 +0800 <wittgenfine> There‚Äôs an old saying that if you build a house for one man everyone will love it and if you build a house for everyone no one will like it. Government seems to function in a similar fashion
