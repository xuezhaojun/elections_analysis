1318929216914731010 2020-10-21 22:56:44 +0800 <PulpReel> Our 6 week lockdown begins tomorrow. But here is a group of respected medical professionals and scientists that say 'you're doing it wrong, World! and #lockdowns are not ideal. Here's why and if you agree, #signthepetition #lockdownireland #dublinlockdown   https://t.co/kv02Ca4JMS

1318310978086469636 2020-10-20 06:00:04 +0800 <PulpReel> Didn‚Äôt they say that back in April? If you‚Äôre obedient little sheep, we‚Äôll open back up by summer.
1318310230187532289 2020-10-20 05:57:06 +0800 <PulpReel> Those doctors and scientists will keep their jobs. Do you have any compassion for the jobless? And the ones who are suffering with depression during these times? No. Probably not.
1318309501481734145 2020-10-20 05:54:12 +0800 <PulpReel> Well fuck you too buddy. If you haven‚Äôt heard already, masks don‚Äôt do sh*t, but being a compliant sheep is forever.

1307010620437524480 2020-09-19 01:36:29 +0800 <PulpReel> @ivucica @adysanz8 We can go ahead and agree to disagree. Which is what the powers that be may want. Be healthy and stay out of trouble. Peace out.
1307009725700149252 2020-09-19 01:32:56 +0800 <PulpReel> @ivucica @adysanz8 That's the risk you take when you are living. Death is inevitable. A friend's brother and sister-in-law died of a car accident a few weeks ago. Death happens. I'm more worried about the suicide rate this social experiment will cause.
1307008444700991488 2020-09-19 01:27:50 +0800 <PulpReel> @ivucica @adysanz8 And that could be your choice to live locked down. Let's do an experiment. All those afraid can stay locked up and the rest of us can continue to live our lives with the acknowledgment that we could die getting this think. Okay, I'll take the risk. And you can stay home.
1307008109521575936 2020-09-19 01:26:31 +0800 <PulpReel> @ivucica @adysanz8 The vast majority of the planet will be okay living along side with this, especially if we practice herd immunity. The planet is being quarantined for a cold. The 99% who are okay, and maybe get it but it's nothing worse than a cold. And your 32% won't exist. This isn't ebola.
1307007200125227011 2020-09-19 01:22:54 +0800 <PulpReel> For those of you who need experts to make decisions for you, as an expert in my field, journalism and media, you the citizens need to start asking questions. Don't rely on the experts they present on government guided media. #dublinlockdown #lockdown2 #journalismisdead
1307006559256485889 2020-09-19 01:20:21 +0800 <PulpReel> @dibayley11 @adysanz8 But the 'considerate' don't care about the mental health and economic distress of the people who will suffer depression and level of poverty that will kill more than any virus will. No thanks. Don't need your 'consideration.'
1307005868777537536 2020-09-19 01:17:36 +0800 <PulpReel> @ivucica @adysanz8 Exactly! Most of the people who have died of covid were in nursing homes, terminally ill, on their way out. Why didn't you care about 'people dying' when covid didn't exist but cancer, diabetes, regular flu, suicide, etc were taking people's lives? No one 'cared'
1306981244312473604 2020-09-18 23:39:45 +0800 <PulpReel> @EthicalSkeptic @sage1411 As an expert in my field, journalism, it's crucial to ask questions from all sides of an issue to find what is closest to the truth.
1306979137387663364 2020-09-18 23:31:23 +0800 <PulpReel> Someone sneezes and the whole town shuts down #dublinlockdown
1306978564475179013 2020-09-18 23:29:06 +0800 <PulpReel> Why does no one in here ask? Don't be afraid to think. Cases fluctuate but deaths have not gone up. What, maybe one or two, a maximum of five this past month? What are the test parameters? This does not justify a lockdown. You're being played. #dublinlockdown #COVID__19
1306977364753223681 2020-09-18 23:24:20 +0800 <PulpReel> @adysanz8 Decent people would wake up and see that we are being played. It's selfish to ask people to stop living, wear muzzles and ruin their businesses for a so-called virus that has killed less than one percent of the planet.
