Even with Biden coming in next month, I still think the US is in deep quicksand, &amp; will be until Trump is gone forever, or the current GOP goes through a burn down, &amp; rebuild, as the former sane party it once was. Right now, it's full of kooks, criminals, &amp; cowards

1311934419226238978 2020-10-02 15:41:54 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @cmclymer I woke up at 2am, saw the news, &amp; have been awake ever since, but, I have to head to work in 45 min too, so am usually up at this time through the week, unfortunately 😖
1311925624123031553 2020-10-02 15:06:57 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @maggieNYT @barblet30 All that screaming &amp; hollering at his super-spreader rallies made his voice raspy, I suppose 🙄 I wonder how much virus he was spewing out into the crowd 🤔
1311917865470177281 2020-10-02 14:36:08 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @greenfield64 No, he must NOT do that!!! It's Trump's own damn fault he has it, so why the hell should Biden maybe damage himself by doing that???? No.
1311915782000054272 2020-10-02 14:27:51 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @MilesTaylorUSA We "should", but considering how he's acted, &amp; all he's said &amp; done over the last few mos, to lie, shade, cover it up, ignore, &amp; misinform the public about it, I'll pass 🙄

He's been harping &amp; harping for months that testing makes cases go up, so 🤷‍♀️ He also hasn't been wearing a mask, while going around the country exposing thousands of people, so HE is the shameful one here.

1311900393576816645 2020-10-02 13:26:42 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @YourAnonCentral @Meidas_Samantha Yeah, considering how dismissive &amp; UNcareful he's been, not wearing a mask, trying to gloss it over, cover it up, &amp; such, I heard this &amp; 😂😂

1310474673155715072 2020-09-28 15:01:24 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @Patricia_Ann_E The Chief Justice is Richard Wagner, he was the one at the throne speech, sitting in front of the GG. He was nominated by Harper, but re-nominated by Trudeau. I was curious about our Supreme Court, after RBG died, so looked into it 😏

I think when they first started coming out, many years ago, there was a small fee, except for seniors, &amp; other high-risk folks, &amp; since I've had bronchitis &amp; pneumonia a few times, I was considered at risk, so have never had to pay. They're free for all now though, I think.
1310183538256416770 2020-09-27 19:44:32 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @NickPonticello Nope, I have an empty fireplace with books in it, lol. It's blocked off, &amp; unusable for fires, so I wanted to use the empty space for books.

1310158208514883584 2020-09-27 18:03:53 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @markhollandlib @telfordk Do House &amp; Senate elected officials in the US have security detail? I thought so, but am not sure 🤔 Just curious.
1310154515845451776 2020-09-27 17:49:12 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @msnaydani I don't watch msm on weekends, I need a break from Trump, &amp; the rest of the doom &amp; gloom, like illegitimate &amp; disrespectful  SCOTUS nominees, &amp; dictator takeovers 🤬🤬🤬
1310149611307311106 2020-09-27 17:29:43 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @JL_Braden @IshatReza @francoislegault They should lessen that, if they can, to a couple of min exposure. Like you, I rarely spend more than a min or two next to someone in public.

1310136885625356288 2020-09-27 16:39:09 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @RichforGA Trump is the one who's all about demagoguery &amp; character assassination. You should listen to him now &amp; again, &amp; read his tweets, but I assume you're another one of his pet ostriches.

Boo hoo, they can piss off 🙄
1309813170656153600 2020-09-26 19:12:49 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @retiredknitwit @DavidColetto I just checked &amp; not here 'till Oct either. I also read that we're ordering 3-4% more vaccines than usual, due to increased demand 👍
1309812320185593857 2020-09-26 19:09:26 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @retiredknitwit @DavidColetto Ok, thanks.

1309809910302072834 2020-09-26 18:59:52 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @gtlem I see the Cons as more of a threat to the country than the NDP is.
1309809658106974208 2020-09-26 18:58:52 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @gtlem I'm one of those. I really do dislike the toole, &amp; Singh does irritate me sometimes too, but I don't have the vitriol towards him that I do towards the toole.
1309808727025954816 2020-09-26 18:55:10 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @DavidColetto @abacusdataca The PM should start his daily Covid pressers again. From what I've seen, they were very calming &amp; helpful for many people, incl me.

It costs me almost a day's pay to take a cab 😖

I'd like to know how many Harper judges are still in the lower courts, vs Trudeau ones.

We just seem to do things fairere &amp; better here, when it comes to these issues, where in the US it's just an ongoing war, year after year. Major reforms of those processes needs to be done down there, more independence, IMO.

With all the recent discussion on the goings-on in the US, with RBG, I've seen some Canadians commenting on our judges, &amp; saying they have no idea what their political affiliations are, &amp; that it's a good thing 👍 So I was thinking about it.

I assume so, but considering it's not obvious, one way or the other, unlike in the US, I'm just curious. They don't seem partisan, which is good, but maybe they just don't show it.

1307255907827494912 2020-09-19 17:51:10 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @clairecmc @RETJ55 But, he's probably thinking Trump will lose, &amp; the Senate will flip blue, so he wants to do this now. I hope I'm wrong.

1306670825853145089 2020-09-18 03:06:16 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @IngrahamAngle Because all Trump does is lie &amp; spread dangerous misinformation, unlike Biden. So nobody should be airing his press conferences.

Our cases have been spiking here &amp; there recently though, so changes have to happen.
1306480573465194497 2020-09-17 14:30:16 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @MalcolmNance @DrDinD I was talking to a guy at work yesterday about a vaccine, &amp; we both agreed that if Health Canada puts out a vaccine we'd take it, but if we were Americans, &amp; one was put out by Trump, without scientific back-up, no way, as Biden said, HE is NOT to be trusted, on anything.

He's a crook, who thinks he's above the law, he makes me sick.

We only have 2 active cases in our province. That was only the 2nd time I've eaten out in many months.

1302935749772423178 2020-09-07 19:44:24 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @Travistritt They're NOT anonymous to the reporters, &amp; it's been pretty much stated, by many, that John Kelly is the main one. Speaking of "sheeple", you seem to be a MAGAt sheeple. I was a fan of yours, no more 🤮🤮🤮🤬🤬
1302933909747970049 2020-09-07 19:37:06 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @Teri_SSW @colleenpierrerd @Emanate828 @StevenBeschloss @RepAdamSchiff @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @SpeakerPelosi @ltgrusselhonore @robreiner @NicolleDWallace @maddow @MSNBC @CNN Because the numbers are going down right now, instead of skyrocketing like they were, IMO, it's making people complacent.
1302932965765402625 2020-09-07 19:33:21 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @glennkirschner2 State AG's need to be looking into all these sketchy people, &amp; charging them if they find crimes, so pardons are off the table. It's ridiculous what these people are being allowed to get away with. I know the NC AG has his radar on DeJoy, which is good.

One apparently said he didn't want the tweets &amp; whatnot, which I took to mean tweets &amp; threats, but hopefully they will speak up soon.

1302273781898117122 2020-09-05 23:53:59 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @charbone1 @murshedz They're letting silence speak for itself. I believe they're afraid for their lives, if they speak publicly, because of Trump's vicious &amp; crazy supporters.

1302202085337968642 2020-09-05 19:09:05 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @KarmaKazi10 It's been confirmed by multiple sources, moron, incl Fox, again, truth hurts 🙄 If John Kelly, or Mattis, or another high-ranking leader comes out &amp; publicly confirms it, are you kool-aid drinkers still going to make up excuses for it? Pathetic &amp; delusional, if so.

1302188599711068160 2020-09-05 18:15:30 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @HunterJCullen @joefrancisco5 So far, but knowing Trump, he'll say something else disgusting, ridiculous, &amp; outrageous, that'll kick it out of the headlines, which is what happens 99% of the time. The press has a very short attention span.

Trump is a rotten, disgusting "person".

Trump has said MANY awful things, publicly, &amp; on Twitter, about McCain, &amp; Gold Star families, we all know it, so knock it off with the cover-up.
1302179562521010176 2020-09-05 17:39:35 +0800 <Jinxy_Minxy> @JMMulvaney1 You must've missed all the tweets, &amp; on camera insults, he's levelled at McCain, who was wounded in battle, &amp; is now deceased 🙄🙄 He even carried on insulting him AFTER he passed away. He's a special kind of evil cretin, &amp; YOU are complicit. Sick.
