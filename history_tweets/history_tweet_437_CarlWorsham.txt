1344052206744588288 2020-12-30 06:46:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @GeraldoRivera I'm surprised the Clintons haven't bribed the prison guards yet.
1344020408710914050 2020-12-30 04:40:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @realalvel @amandadonnell14 Train to Busan was so bloody it was funny. It was just ridiculous. It will be a cult classic for decades, sorta like the Rambo films. Everyone used to count the bodies.
1344018901819138051 2020-12-30 04:34:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @realalvel @amandadonnell14 I think Justice may be based on a true story, like one of these scandals you read about. In one they were filming in the KPop  brothels. I'm surprised it was on KBS. Too racy for their usual standards. I like Ji Hyuk. He has a bit of a Robert Mitchum vibe.
1343857143699693568 2020-12-29 17:51:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @patty78962 That might help, if the claims are true. PA decided to do a post-election audit, so we might find out. So many of these claims were found to be false, I doubt the audit will find any problems.
1343752574885883906 2020-12-29 10:55:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @realalvel @amandadonnell14 I'd wager he was not the first to think of using a window to escape 😀 I got curious, so I just read the Ted Bundy wiki.  The electric chair was too good for him. Now I'm in the mood to watch more Justice and help Nana solve these murders and taekwondo some wise guys ass.
1343689550401597445 2020-12-29 06:45:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @boredjew Nothing is ever as good or bad as it seems. It will be worked out, hopefully to the detriment of the DNC. Their policies are terrible.
1343688223323791360 2020-12-29 06:40:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @0spfinsib Obviously, the entire court did not agree. That does not mean this one judge was right. The argument is they followed the same rules as 2016, and Trump did not complain then. So we are not going to throw out 238,000 votes when the voters thought they were following the rules.
1343687027892617221 2020-12-29 06:35:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @patty78962 Not one state had more votes than registered voters in the whole country. I'd love to believe it, but it's just not true.  https://t.co/4mJJHpI3CR
1343686497036328960 2020-12-29 06:33:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Tuffy5_1 They did not stop counting except 2 places briefly, and for good reasons. The votes that came in late were mail-ins that take longer to count. Three states did not allow them to start counting until election day. Mail-ins from Democrat districts caused the spikes.
1343683359738896386 2020-12-29 06:20:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @realalvel @amandadonnell14 How did they let a serial killer escape?! Did CO have a death penalty and electric chair? Maybe it worked out for the best?
1343671067609608194 2020-12-29 05:32:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Look, I really hope Trump can pull a rabbit out of the hat and win. I'm all for trying. But the facts are not on our side, and many are starting to look foolish. No state had more voters than registered voters. Not one. Not even close.  https://t.co/WQoBBZqlNX
1343667447077986304 2020-12-29 05:17:38 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Gaetz will say something rational, then go nuts. The GOP just picked up 12-14 seats in the House, won 2 more state legislatures and got another governorship. We control most states, most redistricting. Enough with the histrionics! Fight, but don't be a drama queen.
1343653545275498496 2020-12-29 04:22:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ScottAdamsSays China requires travel permits when they don't have a pandemic, so it's a simple matter to lock down for them when they do. But, do you want to live like that? With a PLA watching your every move? We were never going to be good at this. It is not in our nature as Americans.

Truman was too afraid of starting a nuclear war. No way they could have delivered a nuke. Ridgway could have driven them to Shenyang. Now we have Kim Jung Un, courtesy of the DNC!
1343634715404865536 2020-12-29 03:07:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @TMK19882 @boredjew You know, I might block you for this. Many of these cases have been tried. Quit lying.
1343634264349405184 2020-12-29 03:05:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @0spfinsib Misleading. If you have one case of ballot fraud, it will not change the outcome. Illegal ballots? They tried that in WI and their Supreme Court said they were legal. Why is that checked? Learn to spot propaganda. Both sides use it. I'm still waiting for actual proof.
1343633012345475076 2020-12-29 03:00:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @paul_stonewall Those spikes were predicted. It was nothing more than adding the tabulation of mail-in ballots from districts that vote 95% Democrat. It was higher because Republicans were voting in person. Everyone knew that vote would be heavily Democrat.
1343632133856894976 2020-12-29 02:57:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @paul_stonewall @BadCarbNoDonut You can't say it was stolen unless you can prove it. The Trump legal team is free to keep trying as long as they want. So far they haven't won much, and it's starting to look embarrassing.
1343505645480386561 2020-12-28 18:34:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @mmwten18 Let's take the Dominion claim... they did a hand recount of GA. It came up with the same result as Dominion. Or, the GA suitcases. Earler video showed that's just where they stored mail-in ballots after opening them and before counting. No video showed they were snuck in.
1343501056580452358 2020-12-28 18:16:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @boredjew I don't know why. The Mueller Report showed Trump did not conspire with Russia. So that wasn't insane or corrupt. The courts are working. The Trump team just has not proven their case. If they had something, you'd think they would win in at least one court or state legislature.
1343499768811692033 2020-12-28 18:11:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Zachariahskylab It looks like the integrity was good this time. Mail-ins invite fraud, sure, but so far the Trump team has not proven to the satisfaction of one court or state legislature there was enough fraud to reverse any outcome.
1343482853607301120 2020-12-28 17:04:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @paul_stonewall Honestly, have you read one case? Take the WI case. Trump lawyers wanted to throw out 238,000 votes because of a disagreement over a rule interpretation. Those people voted, some for Trump, were told to follow the rule the way they did. Would you want your vote thrown out?
1343479512571506688 2020-12-28 16:50:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JohnStossel I think the entire bill should have been vetoed. We don't need anything in it.
1343457821434802176 2020-12-28 15:24:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Zachariahskylab BTW, I would like nothing more than to see the Trump team present the killer argument to seal his victory. Hasn't happened. Sadly, there really are that many dumbass Democrats. He was an excellent President.
1343456728474660864 2020-12-28 15:20:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Zachariahskylab True, but they have ways to see if it affected the race. And, they have ruled on the merits. Read the court cases. The legislatures have not changed one elector, either.
1343455484951605248 2020-12-28 15:15:22 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @BadCarbNoDonut I'm all in favor of recounts, going to court, state legislature hearings, but that is what they've been doing! They have found nothing that would change the outcome. It's a bag of accusations with no substantial proof the outcome would be any different
1343454684955217920 2020-12-28 15:12:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Zachariahskylab All this was presented to courts and no court ruled they were correct and affected the outcome. Were all 50 courts wrong? None of the six state legislatures agree. They can't all be corrupt. You start believing everyone is corrupt, you are in conspiracy theory territory.
1343448674010083329 2020-12-28 14:48:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Rational arguments here...   https://t.co/rIJjABNiGl
1343444642658988032 2020-12-28 14:32:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @0spfinsib Can you cite one case the Trump legal team won, or are you saying all 50 courts are corrupt? What about the state legislatures? Are all six corrupt? Trump SO FAR has inadequate proof to change the outcome. Individual, minor infractions that occur in every election are not enough
1343429628216692737 2020-12-28 13:32:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @stuckin5points @NoMoreJustus @LouDobbs @catturd2 Historians will look at facts, not your dumbass opinions.
1343420249245446145 2020-12-28 12:55:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Good op-ed. You can hope for a miracle, but odds are against it. If you read the court cases there just isn't much there to suggest Trump won. No state legislature has been convinced to change an elector. They can't all be  insane or corrupt.   https://t.co/pa3YggLCbV
1343417402080563200 2020-12-28 12:44:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ok_first_off No one is giving up on Trump. Some accept he has not won any court case on the election, nor convinced one state legislature to change one elector. When he does, we might believe he won. Meanwhile, it smells too much like a conspiracy theory, just like the Democrats create.
1343416081336201216 2020-12-28 12:38:47 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump Most of this is false. Who the hell is Palmer? Do you lie like this all the time?

1343321826504675333 2020-12-28 06:24:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> We should always incorporate Trump's ideas about taking care of our workers first, being independent in energy and critical supplies, and having  secure borders. That should be a part of every GOP platform from now on.

1343286376293404673 2020-12-28 04:03:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 Jessica needs more practice before getting on the mound again. She just drilled that ball into the ground 5 feet away. 😀 Suzy stood 20 feet in front of the mound at Dodger stadium. Too prissy. Seulgi and Krystal gave 100%!

Mac had a plan to fake attack from Taiwan, so China would have to move some troops out of Korea. He also wanted to bomb Russian railroads, cut supplies. Truman was too scared.

1343254747533488129 2020-12-28 01:57:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Of course, after Jessica threw the worst first pitch in baseball history, Krystal had to redeem the family name. Those two are always  trouble. 😀  https://t.co/Y4LgNYz5GP

1343093175330734080 2020-12-27 15:15:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The more I look at the relief bill, the more I think we can do without any of it. The Trump economy is resilient, bouncing back strong. The vaccine is here, so restaurant and travel should boom soon. Unemployment numbers are not that bad and improving monthly.

1343016680528732161 2020-12-27 10:11:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @VERBAL_CHANCLA @IlhanMN True. And our current unemployment rate is lower than it was the first FIVE YEARS of the Obama Administration. The resilient Trump economy is bouncing back swiftly. No need for more handouts.

More likely it was designed not to harm anyone and the police were summoned with the fake call to help people evacuate, which they did.

1342884395892543489 2020-12-27 01:26:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RepSwalwell The unemployment rate is already lower than it was during the first FIVE YEARS of the Obama Administration. Trump's resilient economy is bouncing back big! His vaccine is here! Do we really need a mammoth relief bill?
1342883185189937153 2020-12-27 01:21:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CEOJimmyLee @bette_oh @TheAnaBraga I wanted him to win, too, but the things you list cannot be proven or were not proven to be enough to change the outcome. Isolated infractions are not enough. We'll see about Dominion, but that case looks flakey. The counting spikes are easily explained &amp; were anticipated.
1342878718549782532 2020-12-27 01:03:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @DiretoReto1 Otro logro asombroso de Trump!
1342877744728842240 2020-12-27 00:59:38 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I made a mistake. It's not 4 years, but 5. The unemployment rate is already lower than the first FIVE years of the Obama Administration. Trump's remarkably resilient economy is bouncing back big. Do we need relief?  Too bad so many idiot Democrats voted against Trump.
1342877403752882176 2020-12-27 00:58:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I made a mistake. It's not 4 years, but 5. The unemployment rate is already lower than the first FIVE years of the Obama Administration.

1342874669880397830 2020-12-27 00:47:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta Unemployment is already lower than the first four years of the Obama Administration. I don't recall Acosta (🤡) whining back then.
1342874247010672640 2020-12-27 00:45:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> We have a vaccine, so soon they can get their bus boy jobs back. I'm not sure we need this bill. Unemployment is already lower than the first 4 years of the Obama Administration. I don't recall Acosta whining back then.
1342871618369056769 2020-12-27 00:35:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CEOJimmyLee @bette_oh @TheAnaBraga The goal is to convince a court or a state legislature, not other Trump supporters. Trump's legal team failed at that, and for good reasons if you read the court opinions. Sorry, I wanted Trump to win, too. It did not happen.
1342870882528669699 2020-12-27 00:32:22 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @squirrel_hockey @TheAnaBraga @bette_oh This graph proves nothing. Hart machines may have been used more in Democrat areas. You might be able to cherry pick a machine brand that favored Trump because it was used more in Republican counties.
1342870062471008256 2020-12-27 00:29:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @TheAnaBraga @bette_oh Yes, I am. The odds are way against it being election fraud to the degree to overturn this election. They are looking in every nook and cranny and can't convince one court or state legislature. Read the court cases. His arguments are weak. I wanted him to win, too, but reality.
1342869085420474369 2020-12-27 00:25:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @bette_oh So all 50 courts, every Senator,  and the state legislatures involved are full of cowards? Really? You believe that? I wanted him to win, but I'll wait for substantial proof that holds up in court or a state legislature, not rely upon internet rumors and conjecture.
1342863567893180417 2020-12-27 00:03:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar @afolayan_eunice @namerankssn @bridget_upton His DNA is in storage, silly. Remember, they were amazed people talking in different languages could understand each other back then. Now we have an app for that. To God, there is no time. All things are possible.
1342851014844698624 2020-12-26 23:13:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Natalie has returned...  https://t.co/3LVEbufjwv
1342697517084004353 2020-12-26 13:03:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @bette_oh Trump has not been able to win in court or convince any Republicans in the Senate. They can't all be wrong. It probably is no conspieacy. The simplest, most plausible reason is Trump lost and there really are that many dumb Democrats who voted this year.
1342693391990198273 2020-12-26 12:47:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MGarciaBiglay @twistninthewind @SexCounseling @realDonaldTrump What about McConnell's accomplishments 5, 6 or more years ago? Blocking Garland appointment, oil tax, gun control, more tax increases? He's been a reliable conservative a long time.
1342687044049506304 2020-12-26 12:21:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @bette_oh Rudy and the Trump legal team distanced themselves from her some time ago. Her lawsuit is separate from Trump's efforts. I don't think her voting machine fraud and Venezuela conspiracy theory nonsense is legit. It seems highly implausible.
1342616329757589509 2020-12-26 07:40:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> TIK quit his job to study history, make war history videos and play his guitars. If you want to know every detail of the Battle of Stalingrad, possibly the most important battle of WWII, he made a great series about it. Much more, too.   https://t.co/lez8coiCdY

1342570307186532356 2020-12-26 04:37:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @stillgray True. That flying carpet never got off the ground, except in faery tales.

1342231230658568192 2020-12-25 06:10:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ScottAdamsSays He still has not explained why someone who had the virus and has the antibodies needs the vaccine. With some scientists saying 5X those testing positive have had it, that seems relevant. Why not give everyone a serum test first to see if they have the  antibodies already?
1342216263075041283 2020-12-25 05:11:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 He made this for a Japanese transit commercial in the '70's.

I'm cutting logs in half today the tree trimmers left. Too long! I wanted a pretty fire this a.m. Instead I will be sawing logs this afternoon. What were they thinking? No one cuts logs that long!

1341956502995795968 2020-12-24 11:58:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden No, it won't be free. You are trying to tax the hell out of everyone to pay for it, whether they go to college or not. You want the whole country shackled into a lifetime of taxes and servitude to the state, like communists.
1341949751181369344 2020-12-24 11:32:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC If Trump obstructed justice why was that not brought up in impeachment? Oh, I know! It never happened. It was all made up, or they would.
1341949222837493761 2020-12-24 11:30:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> If Trump obstructed justice, why was that never brought up during impeachment? Joe is lying again. He knows Trump was investigated for years and Mueller nor the press nor anyone else found a crime he committed.
1341948430843842566 2020-12-24 11:26:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC Trump did not commit any crimes, moron. He was investigated for years and no one could find a crime Trump committed.
1341947637184999425 2020-12-24 11:23:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC Everyone remembers the daily lies you told with your Russian conspiracy hoaxes. No one cares what you think anymore. No one can believe a word you say.
1341904974402494464 2020-12-24 08:34:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Again, Andrew Cuomo does not know what the hell he's talking about. He's the world's number one covidiot, responsible for spreading covid-19 and killing tens of thousands.
1341873831926001665 2020-12-24 06:30:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MAGAPATRIOT34 Yeah, if you have the antibodies and can't spread it, why? It's almost like they don't know what they are doing.

1341779723366612995 2020-12-24 00:16:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> By my numbers you'd only have to vaccinate 45 million adults who have not had it to nearly wipe out the virus.  Could be done in a month.
1341773322091159555 2020-12-23 23:51:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> CA will lose one, too. Texas gets at least 3, Florida 2, Montana 1.
1341770743189823493 2020-12-23 23:40:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @david94180828 @JustMyStyle921 @w_terrence There's a third party within the Republican Party. It's not like Rand Paul and Ted Cruz vote like everyone else. The place to change the party is at your local precinct meetings. That's how we got Cruz elected in TX over heavily financed Dewhurst. Grass roots movement.
1341769580767797250 2020-12-23 23:36:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @sugarmagn01ia Good. Stay healthy!
1341768491645472768 2020-12-23 23:31:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @sugarmagn01ia Who knows? The medical community knows next to nothing. First masks were bad, now they are good. 1.2 million were going to die, now it's far less. Today they say the asymptomatic don't spread it much. Before they were all typhoid Mary. It's insane.
1341767623881732098 2020-12-23 23:28:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MAGAPATRIOT34 True. They should test us first. I have no idea if I had it. Was that dry cough I had last spring oak tree pollen or covid? No one knows until I have a test. I will have a blood serum test for covid with my annual checkup February, then decide.
1341742381398417415 2020-12-23 21:48:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Rand Paul just now is the first person other than me I've heard say it's silly to be giving the vaccine to people who already had it and have the anti-bodies. If we want to reach herd immunity fast, test first for anti-bodies. Best practice.

1341507416882593792 2020-12-23 06:14:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC They can't win this suit. Too many quirks prove it's a legitimate news story.

1341502476353191944 2020-12-23 05:54:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Of course. The Democrat Party's spies have been feeding China's militarists all the information they needed...
1341500788439445508 2020-12-23 05:48:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @bette_oh And do it in public. One reason they don't debate bills in public is they don't want people too see all the pork they stuck in there for lobbyists and their relative's fake businesses. It's all kickbacks and corruption.
1341499698679599104 2020-12-23 05:43:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @mmwten18 If you spend enough time in DC and meet people, it doesn't take long to see what the problem is. These are the most incompetent, arrogant, miseducated workers in America. Need to cut their pay and fire half of them. It's the opposite of a meritocracy.
1341498254215827457 2020-12-23 05:38:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @mmwten18 They're the worst. If they are still sucking off the government tit at their age they are either paid too much to stay or worthless.
1341496174755373057 2020-12-23 05:29:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The bills are written by "staffers" who are young, liberal, bureaucratic members of the DC swamp. Pelosi  pushes through any work they do because she knows it is the same big spending socialist garbage they discussed over ice cream.

1341396519279337472 2020-12-22 22:53:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Jeff92478649 I want parents to decide where their tax dollars go to educate their kids, not tyrants like you. I'm going to block you because you are too slow to follow the conversation and can't think logically. It is obvious what I'm griping about... uneducated people like you.

1341220092437278726 2020-12-22 11:12:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HyeinK1m Theatres hire people. I'm not sure I disagree with them getting help. It's like helping the airlines survive. Better to have a job than a handout. Convince me I'm wrong. I may be😀 My favorite movie house near me closed down, so maybe I'm biased.
1341217575150227456 2020-12-22 11:02:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> School choice is the civil rights issue of the 21st Century. You should be able to send your children to the school of your choice, public or private. Parents know what is best for their child more than government.
1341216906381058050 2020-12-22 11:00:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Why have conservatives given up on private social security accounts? If you invest your social security dollars instead of just handing them over to the government, you will have a better retirement, like in every country that has tried private accounts.
1341213534051577860 2020-12-22 10:46:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RealMattCouch Matt, you're an idiot who promoted the ignorant idea that covid-19 is like a flu. 300,000 people died from it. That did not help Trump. In fact, it hurt him.
1341211936831238147 2020-12-22 10:40:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Ashton7Sloan @RepAdamSchiff Schiff insisted on giving the $600 to families making $150,000 per year. How stupid. He could have targetted that towards people who really need it.
1341211588141977600 2020-12-22 10:38:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @DirkNurkle @RepAdamSchiff Why thank him? He's an ass who lied about Russian conspiracy theories for four years, a total idiot.
1341211289595604992 2020-12-22 10:37:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RepAdamSchiff It's too much. I don't need the damned $600 check. Why are you sending me one? You could have targeted that to people who need it. Why did you insist on $160 billion for states and local government? I will give my check to the Republican party who wanted a smaller bill.
1341205267342569472 2020-12-22 10:13:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> History will show that a small, misguided faction of Trump supporters got two things wrong:   1⃣ Coronavirus is no worse than a seasonal flu.  2⃣ Trump won 2020.   FACTS:   ▶️COVID-19 killed over 300,000 Americans in a year.  ▶️Trump lost.
1341194163681935360 2020-12-22 09:29:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps @VERBAL_CHANCLA You did not read the case. That is not what it was about.
1341192663475875840 2020-12-22 09:23:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps @VERBAL_CHANCLA The county count in the above is off. Biden won 509 counties. The population grew in the counties Biden won since Obama.  The % turnout was high is why both candidates got more votes. BTW, half of the U.S. population lives in just 143 counties, so this is not a good argument.
1341168222633127936 2020-12-22 07:46:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @bette_oh It's all pork to me. I've seen Help Wanted signs this whole time, mostly decent warehouse jobs. I've hired some guys to trim trees, and they are now installing floors for my neighbor. They've been around here finding work every week. Good hardworking men.
1341160754653917189 2020-12-22 07:16:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @bette_oh It looks top heavy for state and local government. Most is unemployment enhancements. This time $600 for each child. I read elsewhere there's considerable food stamp aid. PPP will help keep people employed, like airline workers.  https://t.co/P0da9ISpfX

1341098340352733188 2020-12-22 03:08:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @VERBAL_CHANCLA @SpringSteps Oh yes. Schumer said he'd put Bernie Sanders in charge of the Senate Banking Committee if we lose those GA Senate seats. This would be the first time we've ever had an actual communist in charge of BANKING!
1341038726219182081 2020-12-21 23:12:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps @VERBAL_CHANCLA I think you should read the WI Supreme Court case. Trump's lawyers did not even bring up rolls or any of that. It was mostly about procedure and rules. The voters voted in good faith, following the rules they were given. You can't just throw out their votes. Read the case.
1341037782291144706 2020-12-21 23:08:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @VERBAL_CHANCLA @SpringSteps Yes, all that needs to be investigated and they are being investigated.
1341033669323055105 2020-12-21 22:51:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps @VERBAL_CHANCLA Maybe you can point me to the court record where they determined Dominion software does not work. To date it's just a rumor founded upon suspect reasoning. The vote dumps were expected mail-ins from heavily Democrat precincts.
1341031981409300486 2020-12-21 22:45:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @KelemenCari @Bill_Binney I hate being a spoiled sport because I really wanted Trump to win, but 161 million voted. We really run the risk of sounding like Al Gore chad counters who don't know how to count when we make stuff up.  https://t.co/m12YRKhqbo
1340991586126192641 2020-12-21 20:04:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps Srsly. After promoting the Russia hoax for four years, they no longer can use the words "conspiracy theory" without evoking laughter.
1340986597144145920 2020-12-21 19:44:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps @tracybeanz GA "might" flip, it was close, but I'm waiting to see if the legislature decides these are valid complaints with merit. After all, our constitution says the states decide. I hope our Trump team wins, but so far we haven't, and the court cases I read were fair.
1340982652254498819 2020-12-21 19:29:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RaulByer @elonmusk @MKBHD Probably before the UltimateSuperCharger.
1340982001453699072 2020-12-21 19:26:38 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @elonmusk @MKBHD Why doesn't Tesla have a battery swap system so drivers do not have to wait for a charge? Teslas should be designed to swap to a fully charged battery in five minutes. Bulky, but they are for trips with only partial replacement needed.
1340979962489282563 2020-12-21 19:18:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @VERBAL_CHANCLA @SpringSteps We look like a bunch of Hillaries or Gores when we make up stories or weird conspiracy theories like every court in America is corrupt. Nope. We really lost those cases on the merits. I read them.
1340979402235109379 2020-12-21 19:16:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @VERBAL_CHANCLA @SpringSteps What really cheated Trump was fake news, not likely ballot fraud. It irks me Trump supporters want to use fake stories, too. I understand they feel hurt, but if we can't win in court there probably was not enough fraud to swing the election to Trump.
1340978325343395843 2020-12-21 19:12:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @VERBAL_CHANCLA @SpringSteps I wanted Trump to win, but we must prove he did. The GA video was a fraud. Those were the usual boxes used to store ballots to be counted later, not luggage, and monitors were there. The "evidence" looks more and more like that.
1340977582376890371 2020-12-21 19:09:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @VERBAL_CHANCLA @SpringSteps Any fraud that can be proven is the usual small % of mail in abuse, not enough to swing the election. Trying to toss the WI votes when they voted in good faith was wrong. Read the court cases, all that matters. States get to decide &amp; are throwing the cases out for good reasons.
1340974148315729921 2020-12-21 18:55:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoanPohYY @RealSexyCyborg @BonitaEsBalding Far worse than the US. 600 million Chinese still live in poverty, with their so-called "middle class" earning half the median income of US workers.

1340934445189263360 2020-12-21 16:17:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @jstorey75 @laurenboebert That never happened. People who were there, over a dozen, and identified themselves, said it never happened. The story you read was from anonymous sources who refused to identify themselves. It was the very epitome of Fake News.
1340932623493963777 2020-12-21 16:10:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Why do aespa and Twice include the room echo on their dance practice videos? Red Velvet doesn't.

School choice gives them the power to fire the whole school and send their children to  a better school. The bad schools disappear and the best thrive, like cell phones keep improving through competition.

1340576808199213058 2020-12-20 16:36:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> CA's response is they now want to raise their top state income tax rate from a ridiculous 13% to 17%.

1340570823095181312 2020-12-20 16:12:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HyeinK1m @MailOnline Reputable scientists say five times the number tested positive have had it. They should have antibodies, nearly 100 million Americans. You could reach herd immunity faster, the goal of vaccines, by testing for antibodies first, giving it to those without antibodies first.

1340513356256571392 2020-12-20 12:24:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HyeinK1m Where I live our police would lock them up on a noise ordinance or something. They can protest in a remote park here with a permit so we know how many police to send to protect them and when. We even had a blm protest there, about 20 kids with signs. Here's the park:  https://t.co/5AicU5I1mz
1340508070754078721 2020-12-20 12:03:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HyeinK1m I don't think we can say lockdowns don't work at all, but we should never lose sight of how much pain it causes. Like Trump said, the solution shouldn't be worse than the problem.

They shut down entire cities simply by not issuing the permits and used the PLA to enforce it. Then, let everyone who was going to die just die in there. Wiped it out. Still, I think the stats are undercounting deaths.
1340499048847949825 2020-12-20 11:27:33 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HyeinK1m It probably slowed the virus some. It could be worse, but we should not lose sight of how it hurt workers reliant on people facing jobs and small businesses.

1340488212968574978 2020-12-20 10:44:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @LogosBolo That's how our constitution works. The states decide who their votes go to. Trump is losing every lawsuit in state courts. I voted for Trump, but these states say he did not get the votes. I'm saddened, but the cases look correct.

Not much we can do if they decide they are fine with their voting. I don't think anything they tried will change the outcome. I don't like it, but it's true.

His lawyers tried to throw out 228K WI ballots over some technicality. Not cool.  There was no ballot fraud, just a procedural dispute.

Doesn't have to be perfect to slow the spread is my point. Likely can't get to 100 infecting 99 with masks only which would kill it off, but it likely helps

1340294500464422913 2020-12-19 21:54:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @JoeLinYang @OANN I called. Ted just wants to keep the background checks. Dems want them removed. I said keep the checks, but asked that Ted compromise to vet the visa holders who are already here in place, something Dems wanted, too. No need to send them back. They will pass my suggestion along.
1340287041913966592 2020-12-19 21:25:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WyattTaylor @hughhewitt @WSJ That was investigated for four years. They found none of that. You are lying.
1340286697725112320 2020-12-19 21:23:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @JoeLinYang @OANN I agree. The headline is misleading. The article says Democrats wanted to lower the vetting standards is all. No need with Hong Kongers. They have a real society that has IDs and keeps records, and can do the criminal background checks. I'll look into it.

Many narrow roads along hills in Cent. Am. They drive fast as they can, like madmen. Chickens squawking, people hanging on for dear life, luggage flying around, babies crying. Fun!

I have noticed they talk about themselves and their problems a lot, now that you mention it. They all have some food issue, too, like worrying about GMO foods or meat. Many won't try any new food. They just stare at it like it might attack them any minute.

Trump lawyers who submitted the WI lawsuit, for example, should be ashamed, it's so bad.  The Fulton Co video is easily explained and was. Stat arguments not convincing. I wish I was wrong, but as usual, I'm not.

1340143654875357189 2020-12-19 11:55:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @AndrewYang Why? If they had the disease they are immune, too. I suspect we will reach heard immunity by Summer, so who needs to know? Another stupid idea like UBI.
1340143113558487042 2020-12-19 11:53:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Another stupid idea from Yang, as bad as UBI. What if they had the disease and have the antibodies? What if we reach herd immunity? There would be no value in knowing if someone had the vaccine.
1340141752720744448 2020-12-19 11:47:47 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I'm going to start blocking Trump supporters who keep acting like Hillaries. Trump lost. The evidence he won is a dead end. It cannot be supported and you are making fools of yourselves like Hillary with her 25 excuses for losing. Your 25 reasons Trump won are just as silly.
1340139907902287872 2020-12-19 11:40:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @supersync There was a broke pipe, 17 hours before those votes were counted. No relationship.

1339971560111792128 2020-12-19 00:31:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar I usually agree with you. I have not seen evidence that would change the result. The statistical arguments are easily dismissed,  court cases well reasoned. Random poll site problems are not enough, typical low count issues of most elections. Read court decisions, like WI's.
1339968289204805634 2020-12-19 00:18:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ScottAdamsSays We have half the covid death rate of NY and NJ in FL and TX. Doesn't prove much, but casts doubt on an air conditioning hypothesis.

New Zealand, for example, has one international airport. Taiwan did stuff not even constitutional in the US. China cut all travel in spots.
1339929311760027648 2020-12-18 21:43:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Good to see Scott standing up for school choice. School choice and private social security accounts for our children are two great ideas we conservatives should advocate. Scott is "left of Bernie," he says, but he gets it.
1339927140008144897 2020-12-18 21:34:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @nomad2003 I agree. In fact, the IPCC has said we have suffered no damage from it. If it ever occurs, experiments prove we can suck CO2 from the air and turn it into jet fuel. We can go with nuclear, our safest energy in terms of btu per death, too. So, it will NEVER  be a problem.

1339893271250821120 2020-12-18 19:20:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Everyone is a genius compared to Josef Biden.
1339892279151128578 2020-12-18 19:16:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden is picking one radical, anti-fracking environmentalist after another. Natural gas from fracking lowered our emissions while every member of the Paris Climate Accord raised theirs to high heaven.
1339890194116472832 2020-12-18 19:08:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Now Biden has appointed Deb Haaland Sec. of Interior, an AOC puppet, who hates fracking, fully  supports the New Green Deal and is a socialist, money grabbing tyrant. She promises to destroy jobs, wreck the economy, bankrupt everyone. Only McConnell and the GOP can stop her.

1339797944682360833 2020-12-18 13:01:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CallMeGlib @JackPosobiec Yes, but these first two are different. Some are coming that follow that more customary concept.
1339795777397403649 2020-12-18 12:53:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden is now appointing Gina McCarthy to a climate change post who ignored the lead poisoning fiasco in Flint when she was at EPA. Next, he will put Cuomo on charge of nursing homes. We'll all be dead.   https://t.co/V0bZmTE81J
1339793697995632641 2020-12-18 12:44:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Grandam101 We actually do not know yet she cheated. You have a picture of a post. It has not even been filed as a criminal case. That likely means it's fake.
1339793250308272130 2020-12-18 12:42:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @comw1961 There has been no mathematical argument even presented in court. I already explained how corrupt that charge is. They cherry picked the data.
1339786755369824256 2020-12-18 12:17:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @comw1961 OK, just cite the court outcome of whatever else you think it was, and I'll look into it. You can look up the WI case in Google or DDG. All I'm doing is conveying the truth. If you have secret info, let us know.
1339785191406112769 2020-12-18 12:10:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @blue_proton @FastCompany None. We'll use nuclear, our safest form of energy in btu produced per death. We can suck that shit out of the air and turn it into jet fuel, if it ever becomes a problem. So far co2 is not a problem, according to the IPCC, and may never be.
1339777885234708480 2020-12-18 11:41:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @TexCIS We should probably try that again. Texas would thrive without the rest of the US holding us back.
1339776647415934978 2020-12-18 11:36:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Grandam101 And how many votes is that? If enough to change GA, how will that affect the outcome? You'd need two more states. This would be minor, if it turns out to be  anything at all.
1339773807066812422 2020-12-18 11:25:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @comw1961 Again, read the court decisions. It really is the case that the Trump team is filing frivolous complaints.
1339773422499467264 2020-12-18 11:24:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @comw1961 Trump's lawyers tried to convince the WI court those 238K votes were illegal and failed. Why? Because they were not illegal. How would you like to have followed the instructions on how to vote, then have your vote thrown out because lawyers decided Trump should win?
1339738871911878663 2020-12-18 09:06:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> These county totals are wrong and the populations of the counties Biden won are far larger now than in 2008 or 2012. Look, I wanted Trump to win, too, but lying about it does not help. This is not evidence.  https://t.co/6tTRNnQYOV
1339737030272626688 2020-12-18 08:59:33 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @martindirker @ScottAdamsSays The populations of the counties Biden won are far larger than in 2012 or 2008, too.

1339733203020640261 2020-12-18 08:44:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Grandam101 Read the WI case decision and tell me which parts you disagree with.
1339728552581881857 2020-12-18 08:25:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Grandam101 You should find the actual legal cases and read them. I posted earlier about the faulty reasoning in their MI statistical arguments. Read that.
1339727732629004292 2020-12-18 08:22:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Grandam101 After reading the WI case Trump's lawyers should be ashamed pushing that BS and attempting to erase 238,000 perfectly acceptable and legal ballots. The courts were correct to throw that and the others out.
1339706246153330688 2020-12-18 06:57:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RepAOC Nearly all those workers making less that $20K are students. People are unemployed because Democrats like you shut down too many businesses and reduced seating. Looks like Obamacare did not work if 92 million have little to no insurance, but you won't let the GOP fix it.
1339704778159509504 2020-12-18 06:51:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RepAOC They need a job. The Democrat Party shutting down businesses is why they can't find one. You just want everyone welfare so you can control their lives even more.
1339701593571274752 2020-12-18 06:38:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Trump governed like any Republican except introducing better border security policy and targeted tariffs. Tax cuts, less regulation are long held GOP ideas. Enterprise zones came from Jack Kemp. Ted Cruz selected his judge list. The idea the GOP is dead without Trump is BS.

1339695067263606784 2020-12-18 06:12:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Sounds like it could be a good movie.
1339692384741978113 2020-12-18 06:02:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @comw1961 An example is the WI case. It really was about the rules, not fraud. Trump had no problem with those same rules in 2016. You don't throw out 238,000 votes because of a petty rules squabble, and the Trump team really had no good argument about those rules.
1339691560854818819 2020-12-18 05:58:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @comw1961 It seems unbelievable, but the Fake News brainwashing was real, the biggest fraud of this election. I'm convinced the vote totals are accurate. I read 4 of the court cases my lawyer brother sent me. They ruled correctly and the evidence the Trump team gave was not any good.
1339688942795444226 2020-12-18 05:48:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Grandam101 Why would I lie? I wanted Trump to win. I'm disappointed I found so many holes in the "evidence." It's just not convincing evidence at all. If they find some convincing evidence enough to change anything, I will admit it.
1339688138382471177 2020-12-18 05:45:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @comw1961 There is no evidence of foreign manipulation of votes. It's pure speculation at this point. When I see it, I will freely admit it.
1339687595060674570 2020-12-18 05:43:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @comw1961 Of course I want it investigated and it is being investigated. The fact is that there is not adequate evidence of fraud to change the outcome. In fact, much of the "evidence" proves nothing. Read the court cases. Examine the data. Look at how many false claims are being made.
1339687119871209473 2020-12-18 05:41:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Grandam101 I'm not trying to prove anything. I'm pointing out all this talk about massive election fraud that gave Biden the election is false.
1339686755835006977 2020-12-18 05:39:47 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @finaltouchfini1 @JustMyStyle921 @AntonyCook59 @catturd2 OK. This is that same case that keeps cropping up. The "tabulation errors" were an operator who accidently transferred data wrong. They caught the error, corrected it, and the final vote tally submitted showed Trump won. This would not change the outcome of the election.
1339685242727219209 2020-12-18 05:33:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Grandam101 I watched Dr. Shiva's explanation of the statistics proving fraud. My first question was "Why is he using only four counties?" Upon closer examination I figured out why... the other counties do not prove there was fraud. He cherry picked his statistics.
1339683950055346184 2020-12-18 05:28:38 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I'm all for Trump, but I'm more concerned about the truth. I looked at the evidence closely and found no reason to think we had a level of fraud that would make a difference in this election's outcome. Both sides use propaganda. I have no qualms about pointing out any I spot.
1339682787138428928 2020-12-18 05:24:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @heil_micah I'm all for Trump, but I'm more concerned about the truth. There just isn't enough evidence the election was turned over by fraud. Both sides use propaganda.
1339682199688376320 2020-12-18 05:21:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @heil_micah The first number is false. Biden won 180 fewer counties than Obama. Out of over 3,000 counties that is a smallish number.  Our population increased since 2016, and we had a much larger percentage voter turnout. Your data only shows that the urban areas voted more Democrat.
1339680082982547459 2020-12-18 05:13:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> For further information look up "cherry picking" or "Texas sharpshooter fallacy."
1339673734509158401 2020-12-18 04:48:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @JoeBiden He talks about souls after basing his campaign on the "fine people" lie.
1339668818201878528 2020-12-18 04:28:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Why is it other states can't be like Texas? Conservative government works. Why would want to change?
1339667162160611328 2020-12-18 04:21:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The GOP is just fine. Lots of room in it for people with differing views.  If the party can hold Trump, Rand Paul and Kasich it is a big tent. Forming a new party and cutting our power in half is an idiot idea.
1339664276722769926 2020-12-18 04:10:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @UPatriot78 @JustMyStyle921 @AntonyCook59 @catturd2 The evidence presented does not pass the smell test. The statistics are easily explained, not evidence. Read the court cases. WI was not fraud, just a rules interpretation dispute. The voters followed the rules given to them.

1339433260762476546 2020-12-17 12:52:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> And how is Ohio a bellwether when they picked the loser 5 times since 1860? Missouri was once called a bellwether, and is now a red state. Things change.
1339396895094026245 2020-12-17 10:27:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> That is how you get ballot dumps that are 99% Dem when they add in the mailins. Then you have someone who wants to prove fraud. Naturally, they would pick that district to prove their point.
1339396288446685185 2020-12-17 10:25:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Suppose you have a district that always votes 95% Dem, 5% Rep. The Dems are told to mail in ballots or they will die of covid. The Reps are told to vote in person...
1339386288076668928 2020-12-17 09:45:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @lwburwell What other election had this high a percentage of mail in ballots?  Answer: None  Use your damned brain.
1339385862111584258 2020-12-17 09:44:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @lwburwell No, it's not impossible. What districts did they come from? Many districts vote 98% Democrat. It happens all the time. Some areas vote 100% for a candidate.
1339385202389487616 2020-12-17 09:41:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @shesova It's perfectly consistent to vote for Trump, like what he did as President, and realize based on the facts it is highly unlikely he won the election. I read the court cases, looked at the math and all the arguments, and there  is just not enough valid evidence to think he won.
1339384148285374466 2020-12-17 09:37:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @bstovalljr I agree. She's accomplished more in four years for our country than Biden did in 47 years in government. That tennis pavilion Melania created will live on in history longer than Harris.
1339383453909987328 2020-12-17 09:34:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @lwburwell Read the info I gave you. Everyone knew there would be a dump of votes for Biden before it happened. Mailin voters were known to be favoring Biden. This election was different from any other because of the large number of mailin ballots. It cannot be compared to past elections.
1339382545436336130 2020-12-17 09:30:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Melania speaks four more languages than Dr. Jill Biden and five more than Joe Biden.

I've looked into all Trump's claims and they are like that, and I'm a Republican who voted for Trump twice. Everyone knew the mailins would trend Biden beforehand. When they added in the total mailins it spiked.

1339249652651134977 2020-12-17 00:42:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @lwburwell I've looked at the evidence, read the cases.
1339249461080567818 2020-12-17 00:42:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Coconspiritor1 It is transparent. Did you read the Nevada court decision against Trump? Logical, well thought out, and Trump lost. There was just no evidence supporting his claims. It was theatre, not a valid suit. Sorry, but I'm just facing reality.

1339247856134316034 2020-12-17 00:35:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @inherentlypolit The Democrats have a far larger problem with people who "think" with their feelings.

Unlikely. It's disappointing to me, but reality. GA and 2022 should be the focus.
1339238763621470211 2020-12-16 23:59:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Chris23703 @JustMyStyle921 @AntonyCook59 @catturd2 They fixed that operator error immediately. Trump won that county. One error in one county of only 23,000 people will not swing an election, anyway. You'd have to find hundreds like that in Michigan.
1339237518487719937 2020-12-16 23:54:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @FlatbedEGL @JustMyStyle921 @AntonyCook59 @catturd2 No, Democrats want you to think elections are a fraud so you don't vote. If we hold GA, the Senate can block socialist policy. That should be the focus and 2022. The conspiracy theories aren't helping.
1339235339286810625 2020-12-16 23:46:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The "evidence" is all being presented and it's not good enough. Random affidavits and one operator error that was immediately corrected is not enough to swing an election. Trump lost.  I'm saddened, but we lost &amp; don't have enough evidence proving otherwise.

I've been voting straight R for decades. Independents are who turned on Trump. Look at the exit polling. GOP went from 92% Trump to 94%. Ind down from 43% to 41%. Dem same 5%.
1339230863859605505 2020-12-16 23:28:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Coconspiritor1 If this turns out to be false will you drop the conspiracy theories?
1339229310624862210 2020-12-16 23:22:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The GOP turned out in record numbers for Trump and went from 92% voting Trump in 2016 to 94%. Independents went from 43% DOWN to 41%. Democrats stayed at 5%. Yes, Independents increased their numbers, too, but decreased their percent support and caused the loss, not the GOP.

Even if he won ALL that county, it was not enough to change Michigan, not even a little. AND they caught the problem &amp; fixed it before turning in the final results.

You have weak evidence of random examples that do not amount to a hill of beans. In my state we had 1007 bad ballots one year. Out of millions that won't help. We'd have to change 3 to 4 states, too. It's just not there.
1339207729395748866 2020-12-16 21:56:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Coconspiritor1 You can't prove a negative. Anyone who studied logic knows that. It is incumbent on you to prove fraud. That has not happened, likely won't. The odds do not favor enough fraud in enough states to move the needle.

No others come to mind that had proven issues. Not saying it's impossible, but the odds are very, very low. Even if Trump got ALL Atrium votes, it would not move the final results one iota.

With no large numbers of proven fraud in enough key states, 3 or 4 states, there is no reason to believe Trump won. Small, random infractions that occur in every election won't get you there.

They spotted the problem, fixed it imediately, Trump won by 3700 votes in a county of 23,000. Even if ALL the votes went Trump, it would not be enough to change Michigan. That error was just a random, isolated accident.

1338988631747407873 2020-12-16 07:25:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar I'm permanently retired now, and K Dramas get in the way of me accomplishing what need to do. I can't imagine watching more than a few a year, if I worked. I watch little else, though.
1338987623839375360 2020-12-16 07:21:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar True. Peace and prosperity will disappear, it looks like. Happy music, good food and exercise will definitely help get through it.
1338985111073804290 2020-12-16 07:11:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar I have not seen it. Ah Jung tells me what to watch. She's watching one I recommended now, Start-Up, and I'm watching Justice she recommended. Your wife should follow her for K Drama tips. City Hunter is my favorite still.
1338981800845201416 2020-12-16 06:58:33 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar Yes. Someone posted one of her drum covers. Only time I saw her.
1338980402053132288 2020-12-16 06:52:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar Before covid, I was running 2.5 miles. I had a playlist for running, all happy songs. This was on it. They closed my gym and for some reason I lost my discipline, even though 60% of my running was outdoors all along. Srsly, it helps me stay positive...   https://t.co/j41UyHift1
1338977600358789120 2020-12-16 06:41:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar I like happy. Try this, next time you are in a bad mood. It won't last. Our moods are affected by what we hear, eat, see and smell as much as anything.  https://t.co/krl9kU1JdM
1338974691474726912 2020-12-16 06:30:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar I had a gf from China. She got me addicted. All of East Asia watches K Drama and listens to KPop, 3 billion people. It's actually the most popular TV and music on this planet now.
1338969836085456900 2020-12-16 06:11:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @nypost Bill Nye (🤡).You'd think a scientist would be able to think logically, not advocate giving a COVID-19 vaccine to someone whose body is already swimming with natural  COVID-19 anti-bodies.  Just a thought 😀
1338965232207753218 2020-12-16 05:52:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar It's too clean and consistent to have been recorded voice on the backing track. They do not sing it live. So, I imagine they may have sampled it, spread it across the keyboard and entered it on the piano role work space.
1338963892878381063 2020-12-16 05:47:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar I think they sampled the Ah la las and put them on a piano roll, and the quarter note harmony at 0:30.
1338962836387663873 2020-12-16 05:43:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar This one I think uses sampled voices in harmony. I've seen them live and it is on the backing track. At start and 0:30, that is sampled voice...  https://t.co/CauMdUTU4v

1338957584645185536 2020-12-16 05:22:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @twilight_chibi Anthropologists agreed ~50 years ago that race is not a good way to study people, anyway. Before that they recognized only 4 races.
1338956674380537856 2020-12-16 05:18:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar I like all music. KPop is the best pop music right now.
1338889066788614145 2020-12-16 00:50:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @HyeinK1m Youtube was blocked in 2008, if I recall, one of the first that China banned. They are now even cracking down on VPN usage. It's almost as bad as Twitter.
1338882767724154880 2020-12-16 00:25:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 Southwest Airlines is around 250 mph faster.
1338881816703459333 2020-12-16 00:21:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @nypost Why would Trump need it? He is very likely still immune.  Is Fauci a Pretend Scientist?
1338833296831225856 2020-12-15 21:08:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> It's funny that those who want to go back to the failed socialist policies of the old Soviet Union are called "progressives." There's nothing progressive about going backwards. If anything was proven in the last century, it's that socialism does not work, and it's deadly.
1338823480331079680 2020-12-15 20:29:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The analysts say it will be October before S&amp;P 500 earnings return to 2019 levels. It is currently priced 13% more than 2019 peaks. What does that tell you? Tells me 2022 has to look unusually bright to maintain this price during 2021. Analysts are usually way too happy, too.
1338818851404910594 2020-12-15 20:11:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> To put that in perspective, the stock market grew 67% over its previous peak to today during the Trump Administration and in only 4 years.
1338817723229478917 2020-12-15 20:06:33 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Obama was terrible for markets. It took 6 years for the S&amp;P 500 to return to previous peaks during his term. Over the course of his 8 years it grew only 36% over 2007 highs. That is an annualized growth rate of only 4% from previous peaks.
1338779252284657665 2020-12-15 17:33:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> If the GA Senators lose, the stock market will probably drop considerably. Not only is the market overheated, but higher business taxes, more regulations and "democratic" socialist policy will not sit well with investors. Just in case, I sold some stock, added to cash for now.
1338777582070796289 2020-12-15 17:27:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden That picture. LOL. A bunch of nut cases.
1338770347366240262 2020-12-15 16:58:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HyeinK1m I read that 93% of Americans are wearing masks in public. That's how it looks where I live. We've done all we can with masks. That may help slow it a bit, but herd immunity, therapies and the vaccine were always the only real solutions.
1338768467303018497 2020-12-15 16:50:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar They will enjoy it, if they like playing instruments. If they know piano and their chords, that will help.
1338767998115590144 2020-12-15 16:48:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar I thought I'd be recording like on multi-track tape. Nope. All the instrument sounds are there. You lay them out on a "piano roll" similar to writing notes on paper. You can add a guitar layer by recording, but it has enough tools to shape sounds to make them sound real.
1338766731477708800 2020-12-15 16:43:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar It's has a ton of features, takes a lot to learn. I took music theory, arranging, trumpet and piano, taught myself guitars. That helps, but it is a beast taking what you hear in your head and applying it to the software.
1338499941921067008 2020-12-14 23:03:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Good thread listing what we actually know for sure.
1338498314380201985 2020-12-14 22:57:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> There's a lot more evidence Biden is "the big guy" taking millions of dollars from Chinese communists than there ever was that Trump was a Russian spy.
1338497156525789188 2020-12-14 22:52:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HyeinK1m He was maybe reenacting a wing walking scene from The Great Waldo Pepper?
1338495291088138240 2020-12-14 22:45:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @HyeinK1m Another Democrat. smh
1338494637749784581 2020-12-14 22:42:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar I quit work when my son graduated and am learning FL Studio to write music for KPop. So, it could be she is thinking along those lines. My last project was learning to throw a golf disc 300 feet. It took me a year. I also paint rooms and fences :)
1338462905931599875 2020-12-14 20:36:38 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 She's pretty stuck up. She thinks she has everything all figured out. Start-Up you can relax and just enjoy. Not  much thinking. Justice is one you have to follow along closely. I always try to guess what is going to happen next. You can't! Too many dead bodies leading nowhere!
1338424720690122753 2020-12-14 18:04:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HyeinK1m And the voting age should be raised to 25. The science says the brain is not fully developed until then, and the election results prove it. It's too young for decisions that important.
1338422993089933312 2020-12-14 17:58:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar Because C++ is a drag. Trust me.
1338422354192572416 2020-12-14 17:55:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 Help! I'm on Ep 4 of Justice. People keep getting murdered before I can figure out why the ones killed before were murdered. Bodies are piling up everywhere, nothing gets solved, and now a bevy of actresses are being targetted. Why? I'm so confused my head hurts.
1338336752176656384 2020-12-14 12:15:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @HeatherIAm23 I tend towards Martin Luther's early view of Revelations below. He wanted the book thrown out like others before him. Instead they just moved it to the back. To each their own opinion, but I put about that much weight on it.

1338332849301315585 2020-12-14 11:59:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @JoeBiden Fake Science is now a thing, along with Fake Presidents and Fake Doctors.

1338329519078453248 2020-12-14 11:46:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Cuomo is an incompetent ass.
1338328961588334595 2020-12-14 11:44:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Why would this guy get the vaccine? It may not be "luck." Does anyone really know how long natural anti-bodies last? Why would we waste vaccines on those with anti-bodies? Seems we'd want to get as much as we can from early doses to bring us to herd immunity quicker.
1338326706789228545 2020-12-14 11:35:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MaineLogic @scottlovingood @ScottAdamsSays Looks like more than 5% above the trend to me.
1338326331633831936 2020-12-14 11:33:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @scottlovingood @ScottAdamsSays Sorry, but that looks like a significant uptick beyond the trend.
1338291003732733959 2020-12-14 09:13:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Dumbass Democrats.
1338289586389331968 2020-12-14 09:07:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @RealJamesWoods We get a vaccine, can't catch it, can't spread it, but they still want us to wear a mask? I'm not getting a vaccine until I have a serum test. Why would they give it to anyone who already has the anti-bodies? No one knows they don't! They could have been asymptomatic like MOST!
1338288262390173699 2020-12-14 09:02:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @twilight_chibi I just watched the last episode of Start-Up &amp; 1st of Justice. I can tell I'm going to like Justice. Nana is perfect for the strong female roles. So tall! Powerful presence, impressive in her prosecutor's garb, and she pulls off the attitude. I like Choi Jin-Hyuk too. Perfect.
1338284663723462656 2020-12-14 08:48:22 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @JoeBiden It's as if Biden did not know Trump's vaccine shipped today and COVID-19 will be defeated in two months.

1338126743757058059 2020-12-13 22:20:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Future elections will have less fraud than ever.

I'd say they are doing pretty good considering they don't have the House.

Need to win the GA seats, take the House 2022. The Trump ship has sailed. Pull yourself together. We won 3 more state legislatures, a dozen more House seats, 2 more Governorship. Just need to hold the Senate.
1338099483910008836 2020-12-13 20:32:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @thebradfordfile It's not true. The GOP is all that is stopping socialism. The party will do just fine, Trump or no Trump. The socialists would like it very much if we thought the party is dead without Trump. We have many more great candidates.

1338068107991142400 2020-12-13 18:27:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Tazmarac @tedcruz We did not have to spend as much because Trump did not totally wreck our economy like those other countries.
1338067784606097408 2020-12-13 18:26:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @tedcruz There is no reason for them to bring their people with them. We have plenty of qualified people and our universities are churning out more. CA really can't compete with TX on education anymore. Why they move to Texas.
1338063746997104640 2020-12-13 18:10:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @kathy2trips @SidneyPowell1 @RudyGiuliani @LLinWood This is the kind if fraud you'd expect with mail-ins. While we had a lot of mail-in ballots, the usual fraud rate would not move the needle far enough in enough states. That's what I'm saying. Maybe GA moves, but the margins are too high in the other states.
1338063037706743808 2020-12-13 18:07:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @kathy2trips @SidneyPowell1 @RudyGiuliani @LLinWood "High-ranking officials" is the same kind of sources fake news uses. When a name is attached to the statements, I might get interested.

1338061255660228608 2020-12-13 18:00:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @So_Cal_Grrrl What didn't happen?
1338061169727332353 2020-12-13 18:00:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @1234alldayDon Vietnam is more capitalist than the US. We could be Venezuela in two years. They already want to give away billions of dollars in student debt forgiveness by executive order. These are socialists. Pray for our Senate.
1338058478158565376 2020-12-13 17:49:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @1234alldayDon Their plan all along.

1337995100710899717 2020-12-13 13:37:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> History has shown that a government's redistribution of shrinking wealth, in preference to a private sector's creation of new sources of it, can prove more destructive than even the most deadly enemy. -- Victor Davis Hanson
1337989581334065152 2020-12-13 13:15:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> So Trump is investigated four years, found totally innocent of any crime, brings us to a record 3.6% unemployment rate, 3.18% GDP growth and Democrats vote for a CCP puppet whose whole family and half his party are cavorting with actual communist spies.

1337871746834239498 2020-12-13 05:27:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps @joeljoshua1020 I'll give you one example. Should the federal government be involved in some grand infrastructure scheme? I think states and businesses can do that just fine. Trump would disagree, and we are fortunate it did not happen because of no conservative support.
1337870765782405121 2020-12-13 05:23:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps @joeljoshua1020 Ted was still a better choice. Anyone could have defeated Hillary. Ted carries the mantle of Reagan conservatives. Trump still is not ideologically conservative enough for me, though he has added a lot of great ideas. I like Rand Paul, too.
1337869320001613826 2020-12-13 05:17:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps @deplorable888 I felt the same way at first. I began to like him September 2016 when I saw how hard he campaigned. A friend telling me he supported targeted tariffs, not blanket tariffs, made me feel comfortable voting for him. The rest of his policies I liked and he is a great President.
1337868254388375552 2020-12-13 05:13:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Truth. Biden will be removed. It sets up for a Cruz v Harris 2024 that Ted can easily win.
1337867619941183493 2020-12-13 05:11:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @kathy2trips I wish I could agree with you, but I have not seen evidence of that level of fraud. Of course there is more fraud with that many mail-ins, but state by state I do not see evidence of enough fraud to swing the election. The main fraud was fake news that brainwashed voters.
1337866923854471176 2020-12-13 05:08:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar I have not seen that level of fraud.

1337861255718178824 2020-12-13 04:45:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar When all the dust settles, I think you will find Trump lost the election. There simply was not enough fraud in enough states to swing an election. The result of the post mortem will will be less fraud in future elections, not more.
1337847681645948930 2020-12-13 03:51:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @Twitter I may watch Partners in Justice. She and her admirer speak excellent English in Start-Up, so I figured they lived here. The other American actors in it can actually act for a change, very believable.  Chan Ho Park is in it! Critical role to express the theme. You'll like it.
1337837975913312265 2020-12-13 03:13:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> We need to have a special prosecutor look into Joe Biden's connections to CCP spies through his son. He's a national security risk.
1337836240129974272 2020-12-13 03:06:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SteveSchmidtSES @AOC @ProjectLincoln Lies. Democrats and Never Trumpers are the worst tippers.
1337835774679638017 2020-12-13 03:04:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar I started noticing that, too.
1337834550613913601 2020-12-13 02:59:47 +0800 <CarlWorsham> If you are just looking for someone to fight for Trump you might need to reassess your priorities. There are many great GOP candidates who can win in 2024 and be excellent Presidents.
1337750020989317124 2020-12-12 21:23:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Kai52754995 You're prayers are answered. Any fraud was not enough to swing the election.
1337701008848396289 2020-12-12 18:09:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @Twitter They are cruel bastards! Watch Start-Up. I'm on Ep 14. It'll cheer you up with comedy and romance. The colors are unique &amp; some great acting. Suzy finally got a good script! She was always an excellent actress. The male leads, impressive. The tech &amp; business parts, accurate.
1337698819325222912 2020-12-12 18:00:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Shemtov10 It will be a good story. Biden and Kamala may be the best that happened to conservatism. It is hardly likely their policies will lead to Trump's 3.6% unemployment in 2019 or 3.18% economic growth in 2018. They are losers with no resume or vision.
1337697842723508224 2020-12-12 17:56:33 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @YapatMe Yes.
1337697758808059906 2020-12-12 17:56:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @kathy2trips If Trump has the energy and drive he has now at that age, I'm all for it. But, I'm old enough to know age is cruel. I'm just saying we have great candidates to put this idiotic, archaic socialist uprising to death, without Trump. His best contribution will be in media.
1337671124210081794 2020-12-12 16:10:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Trump would be my first choice in 2024 because he did an astounding job. In 2016 he was my 4th choice, but I was very impressed by his performance. That said, the GOP has many great choices in Cruz, Paul, Noem, Haley, Grennel and Crenshaw. The GOP has a bright future.
1337668653421047808 2020-12-12 16:00:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Trump lost. The sooner we get past that, the better. I hate it, but the odds do not suggest enough fraud to change the outcome, or at least not enough we can prove. The focus should be on making future elections honest, winning GA, winning 2022 and finding a 2024 candidate.
1337667427207933953 2020-12-12 15:55:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden Remorse is real. It presents a great opportunity for us to make our case for school choice, private social security accounts, low taxes, less regulation, border security and fair trade. A Cruz vs. Harris race in 2024 sounds pretty good to me. Keep your chin up.
1337666080546942977 2020-12-12 15:50:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The sooner Republicans get past this unusual &amp; weird election with millions of mail-in ballots subject to fraud &amp; start promoting our conservative principles, the better. We will never have another election like this again. We will make sure future elections are not as chaotic.
1337664424270815232 2020-12-12 15:43:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Shemtov10 I agree the states involved need to investigate and prosecute any fraud. Again, I do not think, considering how many states would have to be turned, it is enough to say Trump won. There will not be millions of mail-ins in the future and elections will have far more scrutiny.
1337656905573994496 2020-12-12 15:13:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Shemtov10 If we win the GA Senate races, the Senate can and will stop them. Look at what McConnel did to stop Garland's Supreme Court appointment and how he got us 3 Supreme Court appointments! We will fight!
1337656330316877824 2020-12-12 15:11:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Shemtov10 Yes we do. Don't succumb to hysteria. It's what the socialists want you to do. Buck up and fight for conservative principles. The GA Senate races and 2022 will more more closely watched than any elections in history.
1337655557398867968 2020-12-12 15:08:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Shemtov10 And people say I'm pessimistic 😀 Keep your chin up. This was a weird, unusual election with many more mail-ins that are more subject to fraud. It's doubtful any fraud was enough to change the outcome. Future elections will be more fair.
1337625601633624064 2020-12-12 13:09:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> School choice and individual social security accounts should be the next battlegrounds. Our future depends on improved K-12 education and saving social security. We should ditch Obamacare for American style free market solutions, not European socialism we can see is failing.
1337624637996470273 2020-12-12 13:05:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Don't give up on the Trump policies. Jobs instead of welfare handouts is great domestic policy. Trade negotiation instead of wars is great international policy. No open borders! Low taxes and less regulation in always right.
1337623751123464194 2020-12-12 13:02:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I did not want to seem negative, but I knew Trump lost all along. Lazy Democrats did not have to get off their ass to vote, and mailed it in. Rather than get all torqued up, watch Yerihan Bang for smiles, and plot to win the 2022 midterms.   https://t.co/uW3jesg32m

The energy losses in friction, resistance, transformers, charge and discharge, etc., are huge. They lose energy even when not used. It adds up to huge losses between the power plant and the wheels.

If that is not "caring" enough for you, nothing is. That and his 4 middle east peace deals earned Trump this honor. What have Biden and Kamala ever accomplished? Nothing.

Even menial work would be an upgrade for them. It would have to be amenable to the SK people for it to work, why China won't allow it. China likes them being communist slaves.

1334993485175410690 2020-12-05 06:50:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RPat360 @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse Nope. The Trump Administration put in place the distribution plan using our military to quickly deliver the vaccines. He also made sure they produced large quantities before they knew for sure it worked. What usually takes 3-4 years, he got done in 9 months.
1334742674306453504 2020-12-04 14:13:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @tbw096 @ewarren You want to take money in taxes from people who made good decisions to give it to those who made bad decisions. How does that benefit the economy? The most benefit will come from your son working to pay it off. His work is a benefit. He can get a second job helping others.
1334741274168090625 2020-12-04 14:08:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @suzuhiggins @ewarren No. It comes out of the economy when you take it from taxpayers, too. There is no net gain to the economy.
1334740731559337984 2020-12-04 14:06:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @misschrisbunny @ewarren No, you are trying to rob others.
1334740471294332929 2020-12-04 14:05:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @EllsBellsInPA @ewarren Warren has no clue how damaging her ideas are to the economy and to the lives of those who follow the rules, honor their commitments and take responsibility for their decisions.
1334739528842682369 2020-12-04 14:01:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @EllsBellsInPA @ewarren Exactly. There is no net gain to the economy.
1334738939060641792 2020-12-04 13:58:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ewarren We gave a bunch of people huge unemployment checks for months. What did they do? Tear down statues, set fire to buildings, loot and riot. Your schemes don't work, Pocahontas.
1334737554000797697 2020-12-04 13:53:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> One thing we learned this election cycle is Democrats should never be allowed near  ballots.
1334725066626625540 2020-12-04 13:03:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RPat360 @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse That's your governor doing that, not Trump. Trump is getting ready to ship the vaccines. You are not paying attention to the truth.
1334724309726744577 2020-12-04 13:00:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse Cool idea, Melania. I love seeing the Wright Flyer. It means a lot to me. Thank-you.
1334722321064615936 2020-12-04 12:52:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I thought the draconian restrictions Democrats impose were to hurt the Trump recovery to make him look bad. But Biden is promising more if he takes office. I can only surmise they are trying to destroy our country.
1334721232160382976 2020-12-04 12:48:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Truth.  Higher business taxes are actually paid by those who purchase their products. They also kill jobs. Biden and Harris both promised to raise business taxes. That hurts the poor and middle class the most.

1334710714162946049 2020-12-04 12:06:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN He's lying and of course CNN is, as usual. Propaganda.
1334710308888338432 2020-12-04 12:05:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @bstovalljr One thing proposed is to remove all Chinese citizens from our universities. Most are the children of communist party members and the wealthy. Of course, the universities would fight it, but it would be a punch on the nose for the power brokers there.
1334661111484993537 2020-12-04 08:49:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HyeinK1m Cowboy shirts with snaps. 🤠
1334655421605437440 2020-12-04 08:27:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HyeinK1m If you look around online you can find US made clothes. I bought a French iron :) Only one in my local Walmart not made in China. Sexiest iron I've ever had. I feel like a race car driver every time I use it 😀
1334649522501390338 2020-12-04 08:03:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @sulligrl Hopefully, we win the GA Senate seats and can block the communists in our House of Representatives. If not, I think you are right.
1334648241670021122 2020-12-04 07:58:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @thiruverseII @MarisaKabas Your argument appears to be we cannot investigate voter fraud unless we have the relief bill Democrats are blocking. Really? That's all you got?
1334645861549305868 2020-12-04 07:49:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> It's always hilarious when Democrats, who still believe Trump is a Russian spy and Jusse Smollett was accosted by rednecks on the streets of Chicago, lecture us to follow the science.
1334632228622577665 2020-12-04 06:54:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HyeinK1m Hmmm... just noticed 15% off for 2 pair 😀

Expensive, but they last at least three times longer than sweat shop jeans. American made!  https://t.co/QQ2m7kIzzr
1334624442920685570 2020-12-04 06:23:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Google search results are slanted far to the left. Use Duckduckgo.
1334623554588041216 2020-12-04 06:20:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MZHemingway @DuckDuckGo I realized Google lies when it was obvious to me they were burying the Climategate scandal way down on page 20 or so many moons ago. Getting Duckduckgo a couple of years ago confirmed to me they are nothing but liars.
1334621961889206276 2020-12-04 06:14:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @bette_oh I've read of about 5 cases of voter fraud in Texas the past 2 elections, the one above and four more. Every single one involved mail-in ballots. When we have millions of mail-ins, instead of the thousands we can reasonably check closely, we can only expect fraud to be far worse.
1334574503909797894 2020-12-04 03:05:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @bette_oh We have Voter ID in Texas and we lock people in prison who cheat using the mail-in ballots that we usually only allow for seniors and the disabled by request. A few are rotting in prison now.  https://t.co/POTtY0sDHE

1334564110684524544 2020-12-04 02:24:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta Acosta lied with his Russia conspiracy theories for over three years and now thinks people will believe him? Only if they are really dense.
1334563367512576006 2020-12-04 02:21:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Example of intentional  ignorance...
1334385617397026818 2020-12-03 14:34:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 I'm on ep 3. It's developing into sort of a Cyrano de Bergerac story with love triangle potential, good comedy parts. You are going to love it. Have to turn it off now because of appts tomorrow, but definitely eager to watch more. Suzy got a good script!
1334354688699994112 2020-12-03 12:32:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 Nope. I went ahead and watched  Start-Up Ep 1. Warm fuzzies, Suzy's child part is cuteness overload, Suzy is as beautiful as ever. Sister rivalry! Wendy (💓) does OST in this. Sweet break from Sky Castle intensity. Sky Castle was so good, too, the way the plot thickened!
1334328305516994560 2020-12-03 10:47:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 Haven't seen it. I'm thinking about watching Start-Up. I get roped into Suzy dramas because she's so pretty, but usually her scripts are average, not compelling like a Sky Castle or Kill It. I'm wondering what people think so far. Heard anything about it?
1334322122110496770 2020-12-03 10:22:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @jimsciutto He can't understand that by not showing the video he's lying. He's hiding what happened which is the same as lying for journalists. No rational thought is right.
1334267880318365697 2020-12-03 06:47:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Melijojo1959 I told my rambunctious boy who was always in trouble my job as a Dad was to keep his mother and the school from putting him on Ritalin. I taught him to bring down the school firewall so they could play video games. He's now a Verizon software engineer. 😀
1334262826861555713 2020-12-03 06:27:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Melijojo1959 True. Many were given those drugs since childhood to make them sit in neat little rows and behave while being brainwashed. Now they are useless adults with far worse behavioral problems from long-term use.
1334243734834343937 2020-12-03 05:11:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Our first mistake was allowing Democrats to help count the votes. Everyone knows they get confused while counting then just make up any number they want.
1334241419712737282 2020-12-03 05:01:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Americans hate Jeff Zucker more than anyone on Earth. He's done more damage to our country with all his lies than anyone this century. How does he even have a job at CNN?
1334222588818690049 2020-12-03 03:47:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> They are squirming now, fully exposed as the scam organization they are.
1334218135151534083 2020-12-03 03:29:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The media blackout of the election hearings is shameful and a disgrace.

1334157502125051909 2020-12-02 23:28:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Sadly, the prediction markets show the GA Senate races nearly even.  We could be a communist country very soon.
1333788795037093890 2020-12-01 23:03:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> What has the Democrat Party ever done to make sure our elections are secure and accurate, and that there is no illegal voting?
1333612526584672258 2020-12-01 11:22:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @KamalaHarris Trump already did that.
1333607766297108481 2020-12-01 11:04:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN Millions already had it, several times the case count according to the CDC, and are immune. Just check their anti-bodies first and this can be gone in a couple of months.

1333553584324173827 2020-12-01 07:28:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MarkTully20 @RandPaul You obviously did not review the evidence or read the article.

1333474412117549056 2020-12-01 02:14:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Trump's travel restrictions, 45 days to slow the spread and Operation Warp Speed, plus keeping the economy from collapsing, was remarkable leadership.
1333453820832215053 2020-12-01 00:52:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @GeorgieSmyth @cbcnewsbc The more people tested, the more cases. Deaths per day are half what they were. "Record highs" have been hit every week because of increased testing.
1333451653719134208 2020-12-01 00:43:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden will undo the peace and prosperity we achieved during the Trump years, if he takes office.
1333444745134268417 2020-12-01 00:16:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN Does that statement sound logical to anyone? It's pure nonsense. How can we trust scientists when they say things like this? The odds you got infected are extremely low.
1333378260835721216 2020-11-30 19:52:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Huge Trump rally in Africa gets no attention from our lying  press, just like the Trump rallies in Japan and the UK.   https://t.co/FGOJl2WTWc

1332828353020227586 2020-11-29 07:26:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Here's an example of someone just making shit up he can't possibly know. Lots more fraud is possible with mail-in ballots. Every case of fraud in Texas I've seen involves our mail-in absentee ballots, for example.

1332822736863957005 2020-11-29 07:04:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Iran probably shouldn't fire missiles into Saudi oil refineries or give people rockets to fire into Israel, much less develop a nuclear bomb. It's not a good way to get along with people.
1332820646963900416 2020-11-29 06:56:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN It's really funny seeing CNN who spread false conspiracy theories about Trump and Russia for four years suddenly become concerned about conspiracy theories.
1332819876981977094 2020-11-29 06:53:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN The vaccines are rolling out next week. Biden has no say in it. Trump will make the decisions and already is prioritizing healthcare workers and our elderly. Biden is not involved.

They investigated everything else for years. Executive privilege is a thing until the Supreme Court decides otherwise.

1332399958570512384 2020-11-28 03:04:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Fredmcd66 @ScottAdamsSays There's no reason. I'm a Texan, too. They will please note we do not have election problems. I am a little concerned about allowing county-wide early voting. All voting should take place in one's precinct.
1332375437012504576 2020-11-28 01:27:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ScottAdamsSays The question is why? Paper ballots, requirement to vote in person in your precinct where people know you, voter ID work great. We could make exceptions for the sick, aged &amp;  military. Safest way is to count in the precinct with witnesses.  You can see your precinct total on TV.

1332270804243984384 2020-11-27 18:31:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden and Obama created ISIS,  the Libyan slave trade and red lines any sh*thole dictator could step right over.

Maybe it would then pass constitutional muster. Communists are at least honest, while Democrats hide their communist intentions and thus are more of a threat to America.

1331426819766177793 2020-11-25 10:37:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @jazonuxlay Biden also plans to reverse deregulations. He would destroy millions of jobs, choking companies with red tape just like the Obama years.
1331406854732263425 2020-11-25 09:18:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Who thinks Biden can get us back to the 3.6% unemployment with Trump, and the lowest minority unemployment in history? We are in full recovery mode. I can't think of any Democrat economic policy that won't mess that up.
1331405302747557889 2020-11-25 09:12:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @LizDoeDoe They did that to me once. I don't get it. Also, they restricted me from following people a couple of times. It's always something.
1331404431183802369 2020-11-25 09:08:47 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @CameliaxRose What kind of unusual activity was it this time? You can tell us. We won't laugh. 😀
1331404146826735616 2020-11-25 09:07:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CameliaxRose @JustMyStyle921 She was probably participating in unusual activity again. That's what got me in trouble a couple of times. I'm still trying to figure out what it was. Painting my fence? Recording music with FL Studio?  No telling with Ah Jung. She's pretty weird. 😀
1331401805192982530 2020-11-25 08:58:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @lalovestrump @Scarlett_Sandy I'd avoid her and all Hollywood actresses. They probably have some bad disease. Most belong in a straight jacket.
1331399720959348738 2020-11-25 08:50:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @thehill New York has over twice the coronavirus deaths per million as South Dakota. NJ, CT and MA, too, all blue states. How are those draconian mask mandates working out for them?

1331291381004984325 2020-11-25 01:39:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Shut up about Texas. NY has 242% more covid deaths per million than TX. NJ, NY, CT and MA, all blue states, have the 4 highest death rates in the US. TX death rate is far below the national average. TX starts vaccinating hospital workers in 2 weeks, then the elderly and others.
1331290720074862593 2020-11-25 01:36:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @yfactor8 @tedcruz @AOC New York has 242% more covid deaths per million than Texas. NJ, NY, CT and MA, all blue states, have the four highest death rates in America. Our death rate is well below the national average. We will start vaccinating hospital workers in two weeks, then the elderly and others.
1331288055060291587 2020-11-25 01:26:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @tedcruz @AOC AOC has no idea how government, businesses or economies work. She makes a fool out of herself every time she opens her mouth.
1331287223820488706 2020-11-25 01:23:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> She's lying. AOC and the Democrats are holding up the relief package to get more handouts for city governments. The GOP bill of $500 billion goes straight to the people and businesses having trouble keeping their workers on the payroll.
1331278501329186818 2020-11-25 00:48:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> This would be like a tax on free speech or a poll tax limiting who can vote. It flies in the face of our constitution and civil rights. You can't tax the 2nd Amendment!

1331255678778929152 2020-11-24 23:17:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> She has common sense, all too rare in government...
1331228757470957568 2020-11-24 21:30:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Interesting...
1331088894356566016 2020-11-24 12:14:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @AOC Then why are you blocking relief to get more spending on city government? The Senate relief bill is more than enough to give families the food and money they need, way more.
1331085875917287425 2020-11-24 12:02:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Yes, the intelligent part of America gave up on CNN being anything other than a lying propaganda tool of the DNC. CNN quit reporting news long ago, so of course no one with any sense is going to watch it for news.
1331084265329725442 2020-11-24 11:56:33 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Sorry, but we don't have to take this shit from a low IQ turd who thought Trump was a Russian spy. Who the hell does this idiot think he is?
1331081945921544193 2020-11-24 11:47:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Just great. We are recovering from COVID-19, many people trying to get back to work, and Democrats want to bring a million or so more unemployed into the country. No common sense, no respect for Americans.
1331026740374810624 2020-11-24 08:07:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Science has not proven CO2 is a problem, but if it is it's just dumb to stop fracking and not like nuclear energy.

If your kitchen  can be inspected by a health inspector that does not mean they can barge in and rifle through your cash register, for example. That is why they asked what law or regulation.
1330746020418949122 2020-11-23 13:32:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Dank_H2O @justin_hart No. There are limits on what they can inspect without a warrant. It has to apply to the regulations associated with the license.
1330745148855234567 2020-11-23 13:29:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SamWils55131130 @CanadaENGG1 @joeldbloom @justin_hart Don't let them bother you. They are uneducated. They do not understand the nuances. They were right to ask why LE was there, the law and regulations, and appeared to know their business. After all, LE had no answers and left.
1330743550766690305 2020-11-23 13:22:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @joeldbloom @justin_hart So, no, it is not simple. You are.
1330743433053548544 2020-11-23 13:22:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @joeldbloom @justin_hart There would have to be a written regulation of what they can inspect. That is why they asked what regulation, what law. Like if they can inspect the kitchen, that does not mean the can rifle through your cash register.
1330742341087469569 2020-11-23 13:17:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WestergrenJon @justin_hart Unless it is a regular administrative inspection of specific regulated stuff, like a health inspection of a restaurant, they need a warrant. They asked what they were inspecting, what regulation, got no answer, so they had to leave.

1330219660281847809 2020-11-22 02:40:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Remember how frantic lefties were about tests. Look at worldometer and see if you can find a correlation between the number of tests in states and the number of COVID-19 deaths. I couldn't.

1330173172717674497 2020-11-21 23:36:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> It's the student debt that caused the cost of college to go up. If government pays it off, the cost will go up more because colleges know they can charge all they want and it will be paid. Why don't Democrats take economics?
1330142304393420804 2020-11-21 21:33:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ScottAdamsSays @stillgray @mchooyah True, Scott. If you don't mind subtitles, try Korean TV dramas. I always recommend the Korean movie My Sassy Girl as a intro to their entertainment, so you don't have to watch an entire 16 hours to sample it. Way better than Hollywood today.
1330140971384905729 2020-11-21 21:28:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> If Biden takes office, China will likely turn North Korea loose to shoot rockets over Japan again, and may possibly attack Taiwan shipping or aircraft. They will test Biden. How will he react?

1330000586675249153 2020-11-21 12:10:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Jay_Goren @chrislemley @kylegriffin1 @Fahrenthold Consulting fees are not taxed at a lower rate. As a consultant you, in fact, must pay both the employer and employee half of social security and medicare. So the consultant pays a higher overall "rate."

You can't tax the same money twice, at the company level and consultant level. This is a non-story, even if an issue would only result in paying back taxes.

The poor are better off in countries that have lots of millionaires and billionaires. They contribute to charities and pay much of the taxes. They create jobs.
1329765204662624257 2020-11-20 20:35:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Looks like we will have more vaccines than there are people who want to take it before long. They should test to see if the patient already has immunity before giving it, too.   https://t.co/YJyjYnl0ms

1329761842395287552 2020-11-20 20:21:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Ralphy57765125 They are selfish. They don't care about the country or its future. They only care about themselves and how long they can do nothing productive while others pay the bill.

The US will slowly melt into decline like we can see in Europe. Can you imagine waiting six months for surgery as you go blind and can't drive. I got my cataract surgery in three days.
1329756954911191040 2020-11-20 20:02:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @thejacques4 @AOC You're a racist, dividing people into races and turning everything into a race issue. This has nothing to do with race, anyway. Wayne County is majority white.
1329756462713860096 2020-11-20 20:00:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CubanMom52 @AOC Maybe because Wayne County is majority white and AOC is lying her ass off turning everything into a race issue when it is not?
1329755626088640513 2020-11-20 19:57:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @dbirkinshaw32 They are doing better at 38% of gdp spent on government whereas the US is at 35%. UK used to be 43%. They would be the most conservative on that list these days. Spain 41%, Germany 44%, Italy 49%, France 56%. All way to high!  20% should be enough for government!
1329736783387561984 2020-11-20 18:42:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RudolfH13535316 A lot of people don't realize French healthcare does not pay 30% of the bill. They have to have private health insurance for that. In England they wait 65 days for cataract surgery on average. I had mine done three days after I first met the doctor.  https://t.co/uEUSw3eSDd
1329735009398386689 2020-11-20 18:35:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Here is how much less money the people in democratic socialist countries make than in the United States. Would you be willing to take a 24% cut in pay for AOC's plans? Their healthcare sucks, too.  Italy -54% Spain -49% France -28% UK -27% Germany -24%
1329731577341947904 2020-11-20 18:21:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Democrats are the party of high taxes, low wages and more government dependency. The democratic socialist governments of Europe have personal incomes 20% less that the US. They have 15-20% sales taxes (VAT), $6 gasoline and high income taxes on the poor.
1329730297563406337 2020-11-20 18:16:22 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RepValDemings Why are you afraid to find out if there was any fraud in this election?
1329727684340015106 2020-11-20 18:05:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @AOC That does not detract from the fact that Wayne County is majority white.  61% of Wayne County is not black. That means it will affect the black race LESS than the other races you manufactured in our sick, racist mind. Please learn math.
1329725182987087878 2020-11-20 17:56:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @AOC Wayne County is majority white. What the hell are you talking about?  Your complaint makes no sense. Do you even have a brain?
1329721309631311873 2020-11-20 17:40:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Democrats want more lockdowns because they want more people to be dependent upon government. They want you to have to beg them for food. They do not want Trump's 3.6% unemployment record again. They don't want the poor to find a job.

1329709169667158016 2020-11-20 16:52:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> This graph is economic fact. It is actually what happened in the OECD countries.

1329679185250578433 2020-11-20 14:53:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @nguyenthevote There are manuals online Sidney cited that show the election software in question can be configured to manipulate the vote. That and some statistical irregularities are evidence enough to warrant investigation.

1328963892505145347 2020-11-18 15:30:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ChuckCallesto Odds are less than 50%.
1328963455429259266 2020-11-18 15:29:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @satoxtwo Democrats are all about creating as much poverty as they can.
1328962086358159362 2020-11-18 15:23:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @grant9865 @JustMyStyle921 @catturd2 We are holding on by our fingernails hoping to keep the Senate. Odds are not good Trump can prevail. Yes, it's politics, but don't sell McConnell short. He knows how to play the game and get results, even on defense.
1328949937296601088 2020-11-18 14:35:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @kathy2trips The main aim of Democrats is to control everything, even charity. We have emergency food stamps and charity food banks. No one will starve. They are holding up our bill to get $1.5 billion extra for city debt payments, not for the people in need.
1328943583722868740 2020-11-18 14:10:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Only Democrats can find something wrong with individual citizens giving away food. We will also pass a bill, but we are not going to pay the debts of mismanaged cities, which is what they really want. It has nothing to do with food to them.
1328939321483800578 2020-11-18 13:53:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SenSanders That's not the cost. The taxpayers pay for it. They are stuck with a lifetime of extra taxes to pay. That is why they make 20% less than Americans and have a 15-20% sales tax (VAT), too. It kills jobs, harms their economy and is unfair to workers with no degree.
1328672721186775041 2020-11-17 20:13:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SenKamalaHarris That's not how it works. You can't fight the virus, if you don't have an economy. Remember the empty shelves? Do you want to repeat that, only worse? No food?
1328672044012040192 2020-11-17 20:11:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC Fauci said masks were not needed, at first. When he changed his mind, Trump said to wear them and called it "patriotic." Why do you lie about this repeatedly?
1328609319911366662 2020-11-17 16:02:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Concede, Joe, before it's too late!

1328597281340321792 2020-11-17 15:14:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Bad Boy is my favorite.
1328596824739995650 2020-11-17 15:12:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden should pay attention. If Sidney Powell tells you to concede the race, you probably should for your own good.
1328595615954178051 2020-11-17 15:07:33 +0800 <CarlWorsham> After seeing how guilty Democrats are acting, I'm wondering if they are hiding something.
1328532917031669761 2020-11-17 10:58:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @stillgray African and Caribbean blacks do better in US schools than liberal American blacks. Why? I think it is the left-wing values they are taught. Only racist Democrats think it is skin color!
1328525848819994625 2020-11-17 10:30:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @WinterForMT I'm opposed to any student debt forgiveness. Me and my son worked very hard all through our college years to help pay our expenses. Why should loafers get a free ride? I learned as much about work and life framing houses as in college. My son learned a lot at Best Buy, too.

I preferred  sci-fi--Asimov, Heinlein &amp; Clarke as a child. Heinlein was a conservative and my favorite. Childhood's End by Clarke was really good. His shopping lists were probably great reading.
1328520048714129409 2020-11-17 10:07:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @nypost Knowing how the Japanese always perfect everything like cars and stereos, it may actually feel better than holding a real woman's hand.

1328309601331277824 2020-11-16 20:11:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN Democrats operate on a set of lies.
1328309141803311106 2020-11-16 20:09:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RBWaters1975 Nebraska and Maine divided their electors into regions. California would probably need several under that scheme.
1328256631772164102 2020-11-16 16:40:33 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I thought the reason we can look online to see vote totals is so we can question them when something seems amiss. Why did 118,000 more vote for President than any statewide race in PA? Why did 54,000 more in WI vote for President than for their US Representative seats?
1328243595124633600 2020-11-16 15:48:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @hrkbenowen Tall.
1328209509337214977 2020-11-16 13:33:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> So no matter how much corruption and illegality is found in this election, Schumer wants to "install" Biden in office, even over the heads of our Supreme Court? Sounds like a coup threat to me.

Isn't it unusual they would vote for President but not for a State Auditor, State Treasurer or State Attorney General? That many?

1327841989350498308 2020-11-15 13:12:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Is Biden back in his basement? He was parading around pretending to be President a few minutes last week, now disappeared? Napping? Why is he tired? He never did anything.
1327800455431413761 2020-11-15 10:27:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @kathy2trips The irony.
1327790475999371271 2020-11-15 09:48:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Corporations do not pay taxes. They pass along the cost of all taxes in their prices. Their customers, you and me, pay their taxes by paying higher prices. If they can't sell at the higher price, they might lay off workers. The poor suffer most from higher corporate taxes.
1327788963260665856 2020-11-15 09:42:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @kathy2trips @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden There's no free lunch. Democrats are lying when they say they are taxing corporations. No. They are taxing the corporation's customers, you and me.

1327555459847516164 2020-11-14 18:14:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden is pushing forward as if he's President Elect even though we still have recounts, audits, lawsuits and investigations to go and states have not certified the election. It's as if he's living in the Twilight Zone.

1327463013646028801 2020-11-14 12:07:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN Of course Cuomo is holding up vaccines for political reasons. the same reason he keeps New York locked down to destroy the economic recovery. He's a tyrant and evil.
1327462618899099649 2020-11-14 12:05:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN @donlemoncnn He wants to look at lockdowns that even the WHO says are not necessary as "lifesaving measures" while people lose their jobs, go bankrupt and suffer from other illnesses and psychological problems related to lockdowns. He's a fiend.
1327461576123822081 2020-11-14 12:01:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC What is more sinister is Cuomo advocating to delay an approved vaccine for political gain, this after he killed 11,000 seniors by putting COVID-19 patients into nursing homes. This is the most disgusting man in politics today.

Yes, tariffs are a tax on consumers, but a preferred tax that benefits the American worker.

1327446380621783041 2020-11-14 11:00:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Melijojo1959 Many don't know that you have to pay matching social security, medicare, workers comp, unemployment and liability insurance, the employee's income taxes, etc, BEFORE you make a dime from a new hire, not just wages. You have to have money in the bank or be able to borrow to hire.
1327445256246353920 2020-11-14 10:56:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Melijojo1959 Same with people like me who had a small consulting firm in the 1990's. I could not borrow like a big, established firm. So, I had to wait until I had $50K to spare in my company to hire a new person. I passed up on a lot of business because of TAXES that kept eating away at us.
1327444336448036864 2020-11-14 10:52:47 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Melijojo1959 Companies like stability. When Democrats are always creating new programs that will cost the company money, like Obamacare, they cannot plan. They have no idea what is coming. So, they lay off, delay hiring, cancel projects.
1327443513873756167 2020-11-14 10:49:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Melijojo1959 Like Sean Hannity says, "I never got a job from a poor person." I was an employer in the 1990's. You have to have $50K in my business to hire someone because you may not make any money from their work for months. Not a dime. Yet, you still must pay them and their taxes.
1327442506775203841 2020-11-14 10:45:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Melijojo1959 One way I found contracts was to explore all the venture capital sites to see who is building new software. There would be 40-50 firms  in Dallas starting new projects. Some of those sites totally went dark during the Obama years. The wealthy no longer wanted to take any risks.
1327441596678352896 2020-11-14 10:41:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Melijojo1959 I was used to finding another contract in 2-3 weeks after rolling off one. Luckily, I invested when I could. I got so sick of the calling around for work, I decided to retire early in 2015. Venture capital totally dried up, and I liked working on new projects.
1327439138396770305 2020-11-14 10:32:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Melijojo1959 His friends who had to wait so long to find a job using their degrees while Obama was running the country got promotions, better jobs and raises during the Trump years. I can tell you they all voted for Trump!
1327438565438058496 2020-11-14 10:29:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Melijojo1959 My son's co-workers at Best Buy graduated during the Obama years, but could not find jobs with their degrees for 6 months to a year, one with an MBA. My son graduated 2018. He had three offers BEFORE graduation, and became a Network Engineer, just promoted to Programmer Analyst.
1327436587534258176 2020-11-14 10:21:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Melijojo1959 We can only hope the Senate will block anything they try to do and will keep the economy rolling for awhile longer.
1327436108515434496 2020-11-14 10:20:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Melijojo1959 Yes. I was on a two-year contract where I had to drive 32 miles each way, an hour drive to work. My pay was stagnant. I missed six moths of work between contracts. something that never happened to me before.
1327433646941335553 2020-11-14 10:10:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RBWaters1975 We can go back to Dan Rather lying about George Bush's TANG service using fake documents, or longer. You are right, the left has been lying for a long time.
1327431931835920384 2020-11-14 10:03:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @satoxtwo @DonaldJTrumpJr I suppose the Covington kid lawsuit wasn't enough to stop them. Maybe we need way more defamation lawsuits for falsely calling people racists. Bankrupt them.
1327430261626310662 2020-11-14 09:56:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @AOC We already have free testing. Trump did that. I thought Obamacare was going to make sure everyone had insurance. It did not. It was the worst piece of legislation in US history. Why won't the House sign off on the Senate Republican stimulus bill?
1327428719703707650 2020-11-14 09:50:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Our economy and jobs all depend on two Senate elections in GA in January or a miracle. If the left is able to implement the policies of the Democrat Party, we will have an even worse economy than the lackluster eight years under Obama.
1327426516507107329 2020-11-14 09:41:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @1776Stonewall He was one of my first followers when I started using Twitter frequently a few years ago. Now he no longer follows me.
1327315269186949123 2020-11-14 02:19:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RBReich Idiot.
1327315046347714560 2020-11-14 02:19:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Anyone thinking covid was handled wrongly have not considered that countries with the fewest cases and little immunity are the most vulnerable right now. Countries doing well before are doing far worse. You do not know anything until long after the virus is defeated.
1327314383563870210 2020-11-14 02:16:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @nbeaudrot @chrislhayes I will add that the countries most vulnerable right now are the ones with the fewest cases and little immunity.
1327314005082435585 2020-11-14 02:14:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @nbeaudrot @chrislhayes Nick, we have not seen how this ends. Many countries that were doing better before are now failing. Until the final numbers are in, you have no clue how well the virus was handled, and the economy is booming back. You cannot fight a crisis without an economy!
1327313365715324928 2020-11-14 02:12:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @chrislhayes You forget the empty shelves, the job losses during the shutdown. No one starved to death. We had medical supplies, beds, ventilators. It could have been far worse. The economy was saved, and we are now in full recovery mode. There is more to the equation than you realize.
1327312417165086723 2020-11-14 02:08:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Exactly! Fundamentally, you cannot respond to any crisis if you do not have an economy. Remember the empty shelves, the large job losses? Yet everyone had food?  It could have been far, far worse. Trump conducted the symphony perfectly. We are in full recovery mode.
1327307668676108290 2020-11-14 01:49:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC We can do the same thing to Obama.
1327304111654580224 2020-11-14 01:35:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @sistronk Arnold just wants to obsess on eating cheeseburgers.
1327302996301123589 2020-11-14 01:31:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @JoeBiden One of these gay sites said Buttigeig could become the first openly gay cabinet member. I guess they forgot about Grennel? They will lie about anything. No one cares who they sleep with. Can they run the damned country!
1327302017828737026 2020-11-14 01:27:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Juliekins9 @dmk_1962 Something is amiss, that's for sure. Are they saying 118,00 to 161,000 voted for President and no other office? I don't think so.
1327300739258064896 2020-11-14 01:22:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @catturd2 I may get rid of cable and just use Fubo. Fubo has Newsmax and my Rangers baseball games. Other than news and baseball, I really have little use for cable TV. I have a fence to paint and am replacing part of it :)
1327298195765006342 2020-11-14 01:12:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @dmk_1962 Yes, it's very interesting.  I have not looked at the other states. I went straight to the official Pennsylvania election site. Anyone can check my math. You can see the other statewide offices vary, but nowhere near that much!
1327292546704420864 2020-11-14 00:49:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @TomArnold We already have food stamps, One of the biggest problems among the poor in the US is obesity.  Just stop with the lies and nonsense.
1327292089483268098 2020-11-14 00:47:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> 118,000 to 161,000 more people in Pennsylvania voted for President than the other statewide offices. Did all those votes go to Biden?
1327291700444803072 2020-11-14 00:46:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @seph_lawless @elonmusk 161,000 more people in Pennsylvania voted for President than State Auditor. Does that make sense?  The closest statewide race, their Attorney General, had 118.000 fewer votes. Why were people only voting for President and not the other offices?  Did all those votes go to Biden?
1327277665192120320 2020-11-13 23:50:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Ultimatefifthy1 @homegrowngeane Democrats are all racists, not Trump.
1327277254947328002 2020-11-13 23:48:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @alexuscatherin3 @homegrowngeane Quit projecting. Republicans don't depend on who is President for our happiness. In fact, we don't want to depend on government at all. It's a necessary evil. Sorry you lead such a hollow, needy, dependent life.
1327275963500146690 2020-11-13 23:43:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @vegasrenae It's under his discussion of "mercantilism." Because "Wealth of Nations" is the basis of all economics, it's worth reading. Free copies are online.

I never heard of Alyssa Millano, Jusse Smollett or that Griffin girl who was supposed to be a comedian, either. I'd think we aren't cool, but my son never heard of half these people and he's way cooler than me. He even has a newer car and a real girlfriend.

1327095804197285888 2020-11-13 11:47:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @AOC The states and cities fund police, not the US congress. What AOC and Manchin say about it has no relevance. They only mouth these words to get moderate support.  It's a con while they plot their socialist take-over.
1326990708444598272 2020-11-13 04:50:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @bette_oh @stillgray Typical Manchin. He knows states and cities fund the police and what any US Senator says hardly matters. So, he will demagog that to death to garner conservative votes, but when it comes to the Democrat's socialist agenda he will vote like a member of the Politburo.

1326967705367425025 2020-11-13 03:18:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Name me one pro-growth policy Democrats have. I can't think of any economic policy they have that is not deleterious. Fracking restrictions, higher business taxes, taxes on cap gains and trades, free healthcare for illegal aliens, etc... all harmful.

1326696035285078017 2020-11-12 09:19:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden is destroying the integrity of the United States by running around pretending to be President before the votes are all counted, and all recounts and disputes are settled.
1326695148999348226 2020-11-12 09:15:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Joe Biden needs to be arrested immediately. He is damaging the  reputation of our country having fair elections.
1326690125888311301 2020-11-12 08:55:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I will be forming my cabinet now.  My Presidency is as valid as Biden's until the election is completed. Anyone want to be my Secretary of State? I'm looking for a good VP, too, and other slots are available.
1326682721498828801 2020-11-12 08:26:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Can Biden be arrested for pretending he is President? The votes haven't even been counted, and we have recounts. He should be jailed until we are through!
1326679268089278464 2020-11-12 08:12:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @FoxNews He has no plan after Trump defeats coronavirus and restores the economy, and both feats are nearly completed.
1326671451181748224 2020-11-12 07:41:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The idea of Biden as President is a joke. He has no plan after Trump defeats coronavirus and restores the economy 100%  next month. He should go back in his basement NOW!
1326662265576316929 2020-11-12 07:05:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @va_shiva @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Who disputes this?
1326642980288081920 2020-11-12 05:48:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Wow. Many voters in Michigan were 120 years old!   https://t.co/c9cYU5XzUa

1326638990506782722 2020-11-12 05:32:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @BeschlossDC No one ever called the free press enemies of the people. Trump called Fake News the enemy of the people. Your tweet is an example of Fake News. You are creating a lie by twisting words!

1326625803367567360 2020-11-12 04:40:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Colsen54 @MSNBC @BreakingChesky Without an economy you can't fight any problem. Your complaint should be directed at Cuomo who killed 40,000 and the Democrats running El Paso.
1326625276999168000 2020-11-12 04:38:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC @BreakingChesky El Paso is run by Democrats. You might bother to mention that in your story. They are incompetent like Cuomo.
1326624779709935617 2020-11-12 04:36:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Were they talking about the Obama cages Trump stopped using?
1326624398393167872 2020-11-12 04:34:38 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC @MaddowBlog Maddow lecturing about credibility after lying about Russia conspiracy theories for years, the Covington kid, Jusse Smolett, the "fine people" hoax and Fake Noose is laughable. She lies every time she opens her mouth.
1326623601672548352 2020-11-12 04:31:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC When have Democrats ever cared about following the law?

1326622232936845313 2020-11-12 04:26:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN CNN will get thousands more killed by denigrating  the therapies and vaccines Trump fought so hard to develop.

1326480965204631552 2020-11-11 19:04:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> With all this blatant fraud going down, we must invalidate the election and let the House of Representatives decide. Each state gets one vote.   https://t.co/xEFwtW5WhJ

1326324661290999808 2020-11-11 08:43:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden Biden is itching to start another war. Trump brought us peace, peace agreements, better trade deals.
1326323266190008321 2020-11-11 08:38:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @EveODestruction They used to race convertibles down that beach, real ones you could buy, not fancy carbon fiber enhanced fake stock cars, in the open air, in the sunshine, through sea spray, on sand. Now that is racing!
1326321697885138946 2020-11-11 08:31:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The speeds quoted include pit stops. They used to roar down the beach reaching 150 mph. They had a separate convertible category with real stock cars fresh off the Detroit assembly lines, before they moved to that wimpy speedway.  https://t.co/Gr9gpHf0vi
1326307447619907584 2020-11-11 07:35:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @catturd2 Same here. Read a couple of her books. They were good. But she changed, became inconsistent, a clown act with no underlying values.

But when I watch this, I think "Wow, I'd like to be doing that!" I'm not sure I'd want to race without a big chrome hood ornament that looks like a rocketship. The style back then!

1326285264415821824 2020-11-11 06:07:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Democrats are scared to death we're examining ballots and recounting. They know they will be exposed as a party full of lying, cheating criminals.

1326094237818097664 2020-11-10 17:27:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @GretaThunberg According to the IPCC we've seen no increases in tornados, hurricanes, cyclones, floods or droughts, so where is the "crisis?"

1326050327062310912 2020-11-10 14:33:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> They used to race straight along the beach at Daytona with people standing on sand dunes with no barriers. Those are really "stock" cars, straight from the assembly line in Detroit just like in the automobile showroom.    https://t.co/5uKmOmQy1c
1326029537034072064 2020-11-10 13:10:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I think the harsh treatment of Irene may have something to do with Red Velvet's contracts expiring. It seems a bit contrived.

Best way to proceed without splitting the Republican Party in two and handing everything to the Democratic Socialists. We should not be fooled there are moderates in the Democrat Party who would leave! Best to modify the GOP.
1326013733920002049 2020-11-10 12:08:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @EveODestruction @LLinWood Someone who read the federalist papers 😀
1326013269769936896 2020-11-10 12:06:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @LLinWood A jobs first, America first populist Republican Party that maintains its small government stance is fine with me. Trump widened the base, if we only keep his planks. Mainstream Republicans need to accept that.
1326011546267492353 2020-11-10 11:59:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Koreaboo Daniel can find any girl to cook for him when he's not busy. Just buy her a condo. Jiyho can find a rich older guy like me who does not have to work and can arrange his time around her schedule. I could date 3 or 4 busy KPop girls. JOY of RV would do just fine.
1326007843640791040 2020-11-10 11:44:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Why is Biden still screaming at America at the top of his lungs? Didn't they say he thinks the campaign is over? Yet, he's still shouting just like during his campaign. I sure hope we don't have to listen to all this yelling for four years.
1326006177776459776 2020-11-10 11:38:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Fredmcd66 They seem frightened someone will look under the bed and find the drugs. They can't just relax and let the process work itself out. We shall see.
1325980585446223873 2020-11-10 09:56:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC It's also border security. It is a total myth that some Texans don't want border security because of their skin shade, and very racist.
1325975232000233473 2020-11-10 09:35:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Why are Democrats acting guilty?

1325959753445601287 2020-11-10 08:33:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @lwburwell @ScottAdamsSays They need to find tranches of thousands cast with no identifiable (living) voter to make a difference, but this is certainly ample reason for investigation.
1325958697256968197 2020-11-10 08:29:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Not only have they lied for five years, we know they will cover up mass murder (Cuomo) and shut down the economy in their states to gain power. Why wouldn't we suspect the Democrats would commit election fraud? They are despicable, power-hungry authoritarians.

1325955210548801541 2020-11-10 08:15:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> How does Cuomo even hold office? He kills his own citizens placing infected seniors in nursing homes, yet they still support him. Then, he says insane things like this? And they don't impeach him?
1325953702788739077 2020-11-10 08:09:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> It's what they always do. If it does not fit their narrative, the media sweeps it under the rug.
1325953226156466176 2020-11-10 08:07:38 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RealJamesWoods No, no, no, James. Count the number who did not vote, and only a fraction of those could swing an election. That is true in the large majority of elections in every state.

1325947425467604994 2020-11-10 07:44:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN Yes, he's going to force everyone to wear masks 24/7 for 3 months, even if outdoors alone. He promised that last August.

1325937787246415873 2020-11-10 07:06:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Is CNN suggesting Trump has no right to have recounts or investigate election fraud? That is not what the law says. Some recounts are automatic, even, and all of us have a right to see our election laws enforced.

1325920539886686209 2020-11-10 05:57:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Ankle-biting Democrats destroyed any chance of unity by criticizing our President for no reason and lying about him. Now they carp and whine about not having unity.
1325918853197672449 2020-11-10 05:51:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Fredmcd66 True!
1325917282216927232 2020-11-10 05:44:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @hapa_girl33 There were more eligible voters in Hawaii who did not vote than voted.
1325823690987233281 2020-11-09 23:32:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Democrats fail at everything they do.
1325823412258959360 2020-11-09 23:31:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Democrats never accomplish anything like this. Even they admit Obamacare is a disaster that needs a major overhaul, for example. What else have they done? Nothing.
1325822518985420800 2020-11-09 23:28:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Democrats never accomplish anything.
1325819534708764672 2020-11-09 23:16:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Trump solved that problem already, or did you not read about the Trump vaccine today and soaring stock market. You and Biden had nothing to do with it.
1325818860524744705 2020-11-09 23:13:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN Add the Trump vaccine to the long list of Trump accomplishments. Biden had nothing to do with it or today's stock market.
1325817794521403393 2020-11-09 23:09:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Democrats are already trying to take credit for the Trump vaccine and his distribution plan. So much for building unity.  They try to kill unity every day.
1325814124706746368 2020-11-09 22:54:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN Name your source or it never happened. No one trusts CNN after the Russia hoax, Covington hoax, "fine people" lie, and all the lies from your previous anonymous sources. This story fits the pattern of many CNN lies about Trump the past four years.
1325811864824057857 2020-11-09 22:45:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC @nytimes No matter the outcome, if we don't have a recount and potential voter fraud is not investigated we cannot trust any election again. Joe reporting anything negative about a recount and investigation is about the most irresponsible thing he can do.

1325777364425568258 2020-11-09 20:28:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RillaInglewood @robbystarbuck That never happened. He actually offered National Guard protection for them during riots, created enterprise zones to bring jobs to the cities, increased child tax credits,  lowered taxes on working Americans and small businesses which benefited workers in our cities.
1325774773272580096 2020-11-09 20:18:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> It doesn't look to me like Twitter censorship of conservatives is paying off. Maybe they should stop that. If I was a stockholder, I'd be pissed.  https://t.co/9kOWNVdpw7

1325766811980324864 2020-11-09 19:46:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Navymom0 If Democrats win the two Senate runoff races in Georgia and Biden wins, they control the Senate and can do whatever they want. Biden won't veto anything they say. That is how important the two Georgia Senate runoffs elections are December 5!
1325760833855631360 2020-11-09 19:23:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @hapa_girl33 I looked at the vote in Hawaii and it's weird... hardly anyone voted!  If you could register and motivate Republicans just to show up, you could remove Mazie. Just need a good candidate like you.
1325756248709599233 2020-11-09 19:04:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> It's already starting before the results are all in. Bernie Sanders is saying he's going to hold Biden accountable to the Manifesto he made Biden sign to get his support.

1325712338570391555 2020-11-09 16:10:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @dobermankahn Yes, my ex said if you go to college you must serve a couple of months or so in their "militia." They plant trees. You can't even own a gun after your time. I would not give their "militia" much credence.  They aren't even armed.

1325689399980515328 2020-11-09 14:39:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The press lied like this about Trump for five solid years and are still lying.

1325686290017361920 2020-11-09 14:26:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> They counted ballots for 37 days for Al Gore in FL, but Democrats can't wait 5 days for Trump without acting like assholes when it's seven controversial states, not just one. This is going to take a long time, Democrats!
1325683652794212353 2020-11-09 14:16:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Shemtov10 We are, if Trump loses. Trump will move over to Parler, likely, and everyone will abandon this platform.
1325682398688907265 2020-11-09 14:11:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @yeripics True. Makeup and hair pieces can do a lot, but she is very pretty without them, and her smile, honesty and cheerful attitude are her true beauty.

1325671761992691712 2020-11-09 13:29:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RepRooney Bullshit. When a Democrat asks for unity it's a sure con job. They only want to push their radical socialist agenda. Don't be fooled.
1325671251403272198 2020-11-09 13:27:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @lwburwell @naomirwolf Srsly... Biden said it last August and has not changed his stance. He even said he wanted a national mask mandate extending to outdoor activities like bicycling for THREE MONTHS. That could start Jan 20, if we can't stop it.
1325660340378619906 2020-11-09 12:43:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @PetiteNicoco It's hard to believe, isn't it, Nicoco. Yet, they get to vote no matter how uninformed they are. The WHO does not even support lockdowns anymore.

1325622783800446976 2020-11-09 10:14:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> It's Trump, man. About the time you think a task is impossible, he doubles down and goes for it.  Let's say he can't complete the pass. The next four years will be complete hell for the Democrats.  If he wins, triple hell. Their party may not even exist in two years.

1325539028981194752 2020-11-09 04:41:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> We should have nominated Ted Cruz in 2016, but go ahead and keep believing there's fraud. Ted would have beaten Clinton by wider margins, and trashed Biden this time. Just sayin'.

1325292037093150722 2020-11-08 12:20:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @1776Stonewall I think the Trumps are about to start a news organization, perhaps with OAN or some other group. We'll see.

1325290712603234305 2020-11-08 12:15:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HoustonChron Democrats failed to face reality they lost in 2016 for four straight years. I think we should accord them the exact same respect they showed Trump. Let the investigations and lies begin.
1325289506401083393 2020-11-08 12:10:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The old Trump days saw 3.6% unemployment, increased GDP growth well beyond the Obama Administration, the highest median household incomes EVER in 2019, Middle East peace deals, no wars, lowest minority and women unemployment in history. So, what is the "new day?"
1325281936701526016 2020-11-08 11:40:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @hapa_girl33 I've seen video of them rioting and fighting among each other elsewhere today. Amazing the press has not figured out antifa and BLM are nothing more than criminal trouble makers who couldn't care less about any issue. They are just miscreants who belong in prison.
1325280749482807297 2020-11-08 11:35:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden was pleading that we give his Democrats a chance. Let's give them the exact same chance they gave Trump, OK? I promise to do that.

1325278798191980544 2020-11-08 11:27:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta I'm very willing to give Biden the exact same chance you Democrats gave Trump. Promise!
1325278262197706753 2020-11-08 11:25:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> In today's lesson we learn that Hispanic Texans are just like any other Texans. We all just want a good economy, jobs and safety to raise our families and live long, productive lives. Border crime is a real issue.
1325277130498961409 2020-11-08 11:21:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @twilight_chibi The individual is the smallest group, most vulnerable and thus should be afforded the most protection. Dividing people into groups and assigning issues to them is sorta senseless, but hard to avoid in politics. It's like forming a gang for mob rule.
1325264671151169537 2020-11-08 10:31:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The left picture is Trump v Clinton, the right Trump v Biden. Look at how many more counties in majority Hispanic south Texas Trump picked up this time! This proves it is total bullshit that Hispanics near the TX border do not like border security. They love it!  https://t.co/wcmrAa6X5H
1325245823756738565 2020-11-08 09:16:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta LOL! That's electric? I've seen more energy at a baseball game during the seventh inning stretch and any Trump rally has ten times the energy.

1325218270320992257 2020-11-08 07:27:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> It's funny watching Democrats celebrate when they couldn't take the Senate, lost seats in the House, lost governors, are a minority party in most states, and elected a decomposing, brain-dead corpse as their leader.

1325148966242152450 2020-11-08 02:51:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I will start to worry if he actually finds the White House.

1325017957127380992 2020-11-07 18:11:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @twilight_chibi @AOC I really think House Republicans should strike a deal to make her Speaker of the House. The more her stupidity, unwarranted arrogance and incompetence is exposed, the quicker the demise of the Democrat Party.

1324820781738692608 2020-11-07 05:07:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Democrats are claiming the dead are voting for Biden because they identify with him.

If you aren't bothered by reading subscripts it's a great movie for you. It's a true love story, a comedy, my favorite movie of all time. Everyone I've told about it likes it. The ending will grab you.

1324470764834271235 2020-11-06 05:56:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> "My Sassy Girl" swept Asia in 2001, putting South Korean entertainment on the map. You could safely say SK usurped Hollywood in Asia with this. Best movie ever. Nice break from the election ruse. A TRUE love story, too!    https://t.co/gJOLL36dLi
1324467647707291648 2020-11-06 05:44:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @realalvel @JustMyStyle921 I love the single-season format, but when it goes to 16 episodes, it's hard for it not to drag in the middle or lose sight of the main story. Really, 12 episodes is about perfect, or I just expect the middle episodes to be clumsy sometimes.

1324449607171133441 2020-11-06 04:32:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @coffeandme Above your local postmaster is an inspector. Next time, if you can't get the postmaster to act, go to the inspector. I did not have to go that high, fortunately.
1324448501367934976 2020-11-06 04:28:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The very reason we have local precincts is so citizens can be involved to make sure we get it right. Precincts are small, we know our neighbors. People need to get more involved locally and quit giving all the power to Washington, DC!
1324447473071460352 2020-11-06 04:24:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @coffeandme This was our local carrier. I went to our postmaster and put a stop to it. He was very responsive. She shaped up real quick! No one had time to do anything because of work, so it went on for months.  I had to take off from work to get him to fix it.
1324446203514363912 2020-11-06 04:19:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @realalvel Oh, it's a TRUE love story, too!  Based on blog posts by a guy who later made it into a novel. The fact it is true makes it all the better.

1324444351003582465 2020-11-06 04:11:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @realalvel Jun Ji-hyun, the sassy girl in My Sassy Girl, best movie ever. She is an icon of the First Korean Wave in entertainment. It swept Asia as a huge hit putting South Korea entertainment on the map. Assassination is a good, too.  Good copy of My Sassy Girl:  https://t.co/gJOLL36dLi
1324439981629341696 2020-11-06 03:54:33 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I'm sure 99 point something of mail is delivered exactly right. But when an election is determined by much smaller fractions of a percent, the mail cannot be trusted. We must require in person voting so precinct watchers know it is a live human voting in our precincts!
1324438104443334666 2020-11-06 03:47:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I can't always trust my mail will be delivered to my mailbox. For awhile we had to stand in the street exchanging mail because our delivery person was an idiot putting mail in mailboxes willy nilly. Yet, we are depending upon the mail for voting? Is this stupid or what?
1324437112553414658 2020-11-06 03:43:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> People should have to vote in person in their precinct with an ID unless in the military. That way the poll watchers in the precinct can make sure they are not dead, farm animals or pets. This vote by mail idea is insane.
1324434137923657728 2020-11-06 03:31:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Now they say thousands of ballots were "overlooked." Who believes this crap?

1324354840500330498 2020-11-05 22:16:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> We need to verify every single person who voted by mail in WI and MI to see if they are real, living people.

The GOP Senate will block any legislation he proposes. Sadly, he will reinstate the old job-killing Obama era regulations.  America will suffer.
1324188862797721601 2020-11-05 11:16:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @twilight_chibi We still have the Senate to block every attempt they make to destroy our country. I think we can take back the House 2022. TX (3) and FL (2) get five new House seats while CA, MN, IL, MI and NY lose one apiece. It looks like we gained a half dozen seats this time?

1324140723994828800 2020-11-05 08:05:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @2Trust45 @JustMyStyle921 @77X0X77 @catturd2 @OANN @realDonaldTrump @RepShalala We had a close call in my TX-24 with Beth winning by only 1 percentage point. This has been a reliable GOP seat for two decades, but we could lose it next time. Best news is TX GOP will control redistricting and will add 3 new Representatives to DC.
1324070371381960711 2020-11-05 03:25:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ProjectLincoln @realDonaldTrump So you are going to watch cheatinh Democrats steal an election and do nothing?
1324069889066283009 2020-11-05 03:23:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @UnifiedSubtext @PetiteNicoco Not really. We would not have to pay the taxes, so would have plenty of money for anything.
1324050398106312704 2020-11-05 02:06:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC He waited four years for a chance to lie and cheat?
1323899079550771200 2020-11-04 16:05:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> If Biden had a stitch of honor, he'd concede immediately.
1323897256144195584 2020-11-04 15:57:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> You can't stop counting votes because you are losing! It's unAmerican! Trump won!
1323896586955558912 2020-11-04 15:55:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> We will fight to keep the Democrats from stealing our election! We won, fair and square! It's over. Trump won four more years!
1323895934825209856 2020-11-04 15:52:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HeatherIAm23 No! We will not let them steal the election from our President. We won!
1323894893362745344 2020-11-04 15:48:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 We won't let them steal our election! We won!!!
1323893088037834752 2020-11-04 15:41:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Trump knows the numbers and the people. He won, fair and square.  We will fight any fake, illegal or late ballots. We will not allow the socialist mob to steal our election!
1323879144191647745 2020-11-04 14:45:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> If you are staying up late you can see Fake News and the Democrats trying to steal the election in slow motion. Trump is way ahead in all the key states. He won. Watch for the fake ballots from metro areas. We will fight every one!
1323876384951992321 2020-11-04 14:35:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta Quit trying to steal the election!
1323875877239824385 2020-11-04 14:33:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> These metro areas better not be planning any fake votes!
1323873859288911881 2020-11-04 14:24:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar True, 30% are great people! Stupid, but decent people. Their government is terrible, tried to tax my guys for working there, we won!
1323872928526671873 2020-11-04 14:21:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @tyger_tyger_ CA is bottom of the heap in K-12 education. No lie. All airheads. Beaches are worst. Go to FL panhandle for best beaches!  Even South Padre in TX has better beaches.
1323870134545633283 2020-11-04 14:10:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden All we want from you is a concession speech!
1323869795897479168 2020-11-04 14:08:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ifquilt @stillgray Very disappointed in this. They don't want to improve. Sad.
1323869452128178177 2020-11-04 14:07:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @AmyKremer Stirewall needs to be fired tonight!
1323869141544112130 2020-11-04 14:06:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Ridiculous! MSLSD is saying Texas is too early to call. Hallucinating dumbasses! Texas went Deep Red hours ago, all in for Trump, GOP won ALL statewide seats, everything!
1323865930376585217 2020-11-04 13:53:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @hapa_girl33 @FoxNews I'm staying up all night to see how Hawaii votes!
1323865602855964672 2020-11-04 13:52:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> All we want to hear from Biden is a concession speech.
1323865209451282434 2020-11-04 13:50:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @nguyenthevote Any contest or Biden Riot will be met with derision or arrest.
1323863962329501696 2020-11-04 13:45:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta He's lying. Everything that comes out of his mouth is lies.
1323863542685175808 2020-11-04 13:43:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> New York and California pretty much suck. I worked on Manhattan for months, loved it, loved Queens, too, but they are idiots. Visited California. That place is hopeless, full of hapless retards.
1323858903478771715 2020-11-04 13:25:33 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @lwburwell It's crazy! VA still in play!
1323858338413772802 2020-11-04 13:23:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @IhgMember Fox is located in NY and DC. They have caught the liberal disease.
1323857983160332289 2020-11-04 13:21:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @TMK19882 No they aren't. Only Michigan hunters have not been counted.
1323857635679023104 2020-11-04 13:20:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> All those people in Northern Michigan are hunters. They are not voting for some gun grabbing city ass like Biden. Call Michigan for Trump already!
1323855847198511104 2020-11-04 13:13:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Why the hell do they not call MI for Trump?
1323854623568990208 2020-11-04 13:08:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Ralphy57765125 He's a guy who totally freaked when Trump won 2016. He's actually really like that.
1323853747399872513 2020-11-04 13:05:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @TexCIS About time!
1323853553572761600 2020-11-04 13:04:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Of course. We also hold the state legislature and control districting. We will be sending more GOP votes to the US House in DC in 2022.
1323852266626027521 2020-11-04 12:59:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @witchiepoo0618 A percentage point or two.
1323852021900976133 2020-11-04 12:58:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> It sure looks like Collins is a Senate hold. James offsets losing Gardner. The GA runoff in GA will offset McSally. GOP maintains 53-47 margin in Senate!
1323849975344861184 2020-11-04 12:50:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @BretBaier Keep bugging Stirewall for not calling TX, Bret! Fire his ass!
1323849609333121024 2020-11-04 12:48:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Can you believe Fox called OH before TX? Love OH going Red, but TX is Deep Red. 3 million votes in West Texas and rural East Texas we KNOW go 70-80% red. They have not come in!
1323848590310166529 2020-11-04 12:44:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Fox needs to fire Lying Stirewall NOW!! Shut him up, Brett!
1323848085475368965 2020-11-04 12:42:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Fox News is shit. Call OH and TX for Trump already!
1323847605915406338 2020-11-04 12:40:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @KamVTV Just stupid. Three million West Texas and rural East Texas votes have not come in. Those go 70-80% GOP!
1323847018142466049 2020-11-04 12:38:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Trump is still leading in VA. Fox may have outsmarted themselves calling it for Biden. The guns rights vote in rural counties is last to come in. We shall see!
1323845337912610819 2020-11-04 12:31:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Trump is the Dean of the Electoral College. Watch this!
1323844899763048453 2020-11-04 12:29:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> 😀😁😂😆
1323840860585369601 2020-11-04 12:13:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ScottAdamsSays Pretty good. I'm guessing 7% of Trumpers lied their ass off to pollsters.
1323832390159126529 2020-11-04 11:40:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> TX will be sending 3 or 4 new GOP Representatives to DC in 2022. We will still control redistricting.  Sewed that up tonight. TX will go big for Trump now. Watch this!
1323831255214006272 2020-11-04 11:35:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @RonDeSantisFL @catturd2 @realDonaldTrump Done deal. Don't fret. We just secured the TX House and Senate, too. That means the GOP still controls TX redistricting and we will be sending you 3 or 4 new GOP representatives to DC in 2022, too! Big night. MANY Trump votes on the way. Watch!
1323829849312710664 2020-11-04 11:30:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @77X0X77 @catturd2 @OANN @realDonaldTrump @RepShalala Don't worry about Texas. I have that handled. We will go big for Trump! Only the urban areas are counted. Suburban and rural counties come in last and are HUGE!
1323828789487505408 2020-11-04 11:25:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> We are closing in on Peak Trump!
1323828077294690308 2020-11-04 11:23:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ScottAdamsSays The Karen vote is delaying our fun. Where are the good Karens to close this out for Trump?
1323827706916708356 2020-11-04 11:21:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Too many Karens delaying the victory.
1323770484325044224 2020-11-04 07:34:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @YapatMe I want to see it when you are done!
1323769421849047041 2020-11-04 07:29:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Anyone else watching the election results on MSNBC because it will be the funniest when they start freaking out and going insane?
1323763303051677697 2020-11-04 07:05:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @FendiFact @_chstp @Breaking911 Trump doesn't promote racism. No evidence he does.
1323760954027528193 2020-11-04 06:56:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @hapa_girl33 @matuoka7ocean I'll never forget Hawaii. I've visited every island but the Big Island. Kauii was my favorite. I liked them all, and loved the people.
1323742086462644226 2020-11-04 05:41:22 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @matuoka7ocean @hapa_girl33 No matter what happens, I will be up late in Texas just to see how Hawaii votes. I'm pulling for Trump to win in Hawaii!
1323737287642013703 2020-11-04 05:22:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I wonder if Beto is secretly praying that Biden doesn't win so he doesn't have to take up those guns.
1323735289895002113 2020-11-04 05:14:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar @EAA 5 gal gas will take me 100 miles in my 3000 lb vehicle full of people at 80 mph. 4 Kwh won't do that. A Kw is 1.34 hp, like a lawnmower engine even for only 1.25 hrs with 4 hours. Would my car move much? 😀
1323724170841202689 2020-11-04 04:30:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar @EAA Especially for training where you are only going to fly 30 minutes and need to hear the instructor. Ideal! Low maintenance is huge. Piston planes require a lot of expensive maintenance.
1323723051704475650 2020-11-04 04:25:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar @EAA The last time I looked into it, electric cars required more actual fuel than gasoline cars. Wire resistance, transformers, charge/discharge losses, etc, cost fuel. I think power plants improved efficiency, though.
1323702339094614018 2020-11-04 03:03:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> He's perfecting dance. Multi-talented.
1323700422578753536 2020-11-04 02:55:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar @EAA Wow. There are so many light materials these days. Ultralights could become way more popular.
1323677268653334530 2020-11-04 01:23:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar @EAA I can't recall what it weighed. Way more! They had to make their own because no one had an engine that light--key to their success.
1323676839794085889 2020-11-04 01:22:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar @EAA Wright Brothers first plane was 11 HP. You're good 😀
1323675661148540929 2020-11-04 01:17:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar @EAA Yes, and lessons are usually only 30 minutes, anyway, and you could HEAR the instructor! I spent many flights yelling back and forth with my Dad or best friend learning to fly. Did not interest me enough to get my license.
1323653039799078913 2020-11-03 23:47:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar @EAA Think about how quiet they'd be. One thing I did not like about single-engined planes was how loud they are.
1323651501865263105 2020-11-03 23:41:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar @EAA Oh,  I like it! I saw his flying leaf blower video. I guess batteries and motors are light enough now.
1323648027798736897 2020-11-03 23:27:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar @EAA Interesting. I can't wait to see the pictures.
1323540459751440386 2020-11-03 16:20:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar @EAA Electric ultralight sounds like an oxymoron, but I'll be VERY interested if you can pull it off! If it does not work, you can always put a little aluminum block engine on it. Let me know how it goes.
1323516874953510913 2020-11-03 14:46:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> For those feeling saddened we saw his last campaign rally, don't fret. He will have more, but for governors, senators and others who care about the worker, America and the people. Four more years. I'm going to watch tonight's final rally now as I fall asleep. Peace.
1323512821758513153 2020-11-03 14:30:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @chuck_fire4 @Acosta Acosta (🤡) is a lying shill for the DNC, not a real journalist.
1323512467595603968 2020-11-03 14:28:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @AlexMissSteal @Acosta Yes!
1323498878986059777 2020-11-03 13:34:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta Mexico has 27,000 expensive soldiers protecting the border, you ass. They are the wall until it's finished, and Mexico is paying for it, you lying POS.
1323498237534310402 2020-11-03 13:32:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> They have to give you time off to vote. It's the law. Pass it around to all hardworking Trump voters! Let's do this!
1323496993440845824 2020-11-03 13:27:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @BernadetteD17 It's the law, too. They have to give us time to vote. Pass it around to all Trump voters!
1323496234808651776 2020-11-03 13:24:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> It's incredible! He's still out there pouring his heart into it.
1323495710269022209 2020-11-03 13:22:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta She locked up the Michigan people. Turnabout is fair play!
1323495408027533312 2020-11-03 13:21:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The only person other than whiny Kamala Harris suppressing the Democrat vote is Joe Biden. He's a CCP puppet, bought and paid for, whose mind is shot. No one likes him yelling at them. He needs to concede the election NOW!
1323472139954040833 2020-11-03 11:48:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I'm blocking all cunts opposed to World Peace until further notice.
1323471566504665092 2020-11-03 11:46:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MeatManNate I'll bring the beer.
1323468743092195328 2020-11-03 11:35:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @amelie_tng Blocked.
1323468529220411392 2020-11-03 11:34:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> For people who yearned for a Great America and World Peace there has never been a better President than Donald Trump.  Give him another four years and the world will see many more dreams fulfilled.
1323467869745827841 2020-11-03 11:31:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> When I think of Biden, I can't think of any politician who has been around so long and has done so little. Name one. The most useless man to ever be elected to office.
1323465248360333315 2020-11-03 11:21:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @redlightwright @ChatChristi When he's not solving World Peace, making America great, campaigning like no one has ever campaigned before, all the time battling Fake News like a champ, he's inventing a new dance craze. Amazing.
1323464322048249857 2020-11-03 11:17:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Trump is the best President of my lifetime. And I'm pretty old!
1323464077792956416 2020-11-03 11:16:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> No one ever imagined we could have so many peace deals in the Middle East. Only Trump delivered the peace deals the entire world wanted. That alone makes him the best President of my lifetime. Four more years!
1323463033990119424 2020-11-03 11:12:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden What have you ever done for World Peace, Joe? Nothing. Trump delivered something you could never do, that no President has done, that everyone wants, World Peace. No President has delivered as much World Peace as Trump.
1323462340193488898 2020-11-03 11:09:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Everyone talks about World Peace. You ask any random beauty contestant what they want and it's "World Peace." What President have we had who has delivered as much World Peace as Trump? None. Not one. Everyone wants it. Trump delivered it.
1323454982927036416 2020-11-03 10:40:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Can you imagine if Biden sneaks into the White House? Hunter will be out there scamming countries, one after another. Selling favors.  Like a crime family. The very definition of the swamp, skimming off taxpayers, foreign countries, whoever.
1323453239149400064 2020-11-03 10:33:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden put a lid on his campaign while Trump is still out there holding rallies.  Do you want a President who quits on his country or a winner? America deserves a winner in the White House! Trump is in Wisconsin right now speaking...   https://t.co/s9lHwq4NJB
1323451393135513600 2020-11-03 10:26:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WSJ Go vote and you won't have anything to worry about.
1323450982068555777 2020-11-03 10:24:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Just take the day off tomorrow to vote, if you have to. Tell your boss you are going to go vote first thing. I've done it before. This is more important than work.  If Trump is reelected, there will be plenty of work for everyone!
1323449894540091393 2020-11-03 10:20:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @texasglamo @Not_Dutt @BreitbartNews What's wrong with Colorado?
1323448011675049986 2020-11-03 10:12:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC He looks like a corpse. Did they embalm him already? His mouth isn't even moving. Are you sure he's talking?
1323444482344423426 2020-11-03 09:58:47 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC We already have an all-out response with Operation Warp Speed, bringing our economy back and protecting the vulnerable. There is more to the equation than lockdowns. People have to live, and we need an economy to fight this virus.
1323444015916847106 2020-11-03 09:56:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Who cares what she thinks? She lost. Everyone cares about the science. We also care about the economy, jobs, things she knows nothing about. Caring only about science is stupid. There is more to it than one thing.
1323443178779926528 2020-11-03 09:53:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> John Cornyn's consistent conservative vote has earned him another six years serving Texas as our senior Senator. I can't think of one vote he's cast that did not represent the values of our state.
1323442049564184576 2020-11-03 09:49:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 Their STATED plan is to steal our medicare that we spend decades to purchase for when we get old, and give it away to illegal aliens. We need PRIVATE medicare accounts and PRIVATE social security accounts that the Democrats cannot touch.
1323441112862830597 2020-11-03 09:45:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Candace Valenzuela is yet another socialist who will steal our medicare that we spend decades to purchase for when we get old, and give it away to illegal aliens. That's their STATED plan! Vote for Beth Van Duyne!
1323436933628993536 2020-11-03 09:28:47 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 Listening to the science is the dumbest idea ever. A President must listen to economists, doctors, the people, business owners, teachers, engineers, police, everyone, weigh it out to make a decision. Anyone who says they are only going to listen to the science is a fool.
1323435513966186499 2020-11-03 09:23:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @DanScavino @Longshoreman20 He loves our country more than any President in history.

1323434052385443840 2020-11-03 09:17:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden You will never be President. Your mind is shot and no one is going to vote for mentally handicapped CCP puppet.
1323433768871407616 2020-11-03 09:16:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MrAndyNgo He'll burn in hell for that.
1323433632699207680 2020-11-03 09:15:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JRubinBlogger Biden goes missing for days in the middle of a campaign with nothing else to do but campaign. Are you nuts? Trump is the most accessible President in history!
1323433225545502722 2020-11-03 09:14:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden It took you and Obama six years to get the economy back where it was before recession. Trump has it almost back to a much better place in six months.
1323407421516189696 2020-11-03 07:31:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> MJ Hegar is another left-wing nutjob like Mazie Hirino who wants to take away private health insurance and company plans,  and put everyone on a socialist high-dedicible plan that won't cover insulin or dialysis.  Don't be conned.
1323396218224082946 2020-11-03 06:47:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden doesn't remember living in Scranton, PA when he was 9. He can't even remember living in Delaware when he was 77.

1323377860355203072 2020-11-03 05:34:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ScottAdamsSays Scott, they are setting up a BLUE SMOKESCREEN. It is designed to discredit the Trump lead and any actions Trump takes to make sure the election is fair.
1323377244484575235 2020-11-03 05:31:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Democrats are creating a Blue Smokescreen to convince voters Trump is not winning. The Blue Smokescreen is designed to discredit Trump when he is ahead tomorrow and justify recounts, counting past deadlines, legal BS. It's a con.

1323360246027485185 2020-11-03 04:24:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @VonnieDeluxe @ScottAdamsSays That is what some may want you to believe, but there's no evidence Trump doesn't want to count legal, valid ballots received before state deadlines.
1323354188944973829 2020-11-03 04:00:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ElanTheDragon I thought about Expedia and the like as a vaccine play. Once flying feels safe, they may recover. Not sure which is a good reservation stock and have not examined their data. Heck, I have no idea who the players are. I just call Southwest if I need to go anywhere.
1323353237592920064 2020-11-03 03:56:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ElanTheDragon If you can wait 1.5 years or more BA should be OK. I don't look for mine to do much until then or to restore their dividend. But, I paid $80 for it long ago and am fine holding until then.
1323350678161498112 2020-11-03 03:46:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Lion8291 @Acosta You may be right. When I think of Satan personified, I think of someone screaming like that. 😀
1323350085942480896 2020-11-03 03:43:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ElanTheDragon I have no idea, but can tell you I personally will do nothing. I am positioned for long term growth with 4% cash, 21% bonds and the rest fairly conservative stocks that pay dividends except  two stocks who recently cancelled theirs.
1323330351092191232 2020-11-03 02:25:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ElanTheDragon Nice car. Love the flags.
1323328092232912898 2020-11-03 02:16:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta Why is Biden screaming and yelling at Americans? It was giving me a headache, so I turned it off. Children shouldn't be allowed to watch it. Normal people don't act like that. There's something seriously wrong with him.
1323304953004306440 2020-11-03 00:44:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> San Marcos is a great city with an honest and professional police force.  https://t.co/qdV29k5VpX
1323303278961217536 2020-11-03 00:37:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> If Trump does not win, it's because of voter fraud.
1323302929240117249 2020-11-03 00:36:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @benshapiro Biden is suppressing the Democrat vote.

1323301817997004800 2020-11-03 00:31:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden doesn't care about Scranton, PA. Only uses it as a prop to con people into thinking he's a regular Joe. No, he's a Fake Joe, got rich in congress starting at age 27 using his office for influence peddling. Never lived in Scranton as an adult. A liar.

1323180423367794699 2020-11-02 16:29:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump I watch Korean TV dramas, most of which are more wholesome and better written. I gave up on Hollywood producing anything more than trash a long time ago.

1323175376567357440 2020-11-02 16:09:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Terrible. They actually want to imprison people for not tracking citizens for the government.
1323174382957699072 2020-11-02 16:05:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN Fake Science. What about counties that had no rallies? This proves nothing, but that CNN has no understanding of how science works. And that study? Never peer-reviewed, not science.
1323173259614015488 2020-11-02 16:01:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Trump... ten events in one day!

1323162474678525953 2020-11-02 15:18:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @GaddielDomb @MSNBC That Stanford study has not been verified, never peer-reviewed. Even half of studies peer-reviewed are false, and it has never faced review. No one can make the claim outdoor rallies cause deaths. There is no science to back that up.
1323161601210548224 2020-11-02 15:14:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Fauci is lying now. We are in great position. The economy is bouncing back. Most people wear masks when appropriate and our treatments are way better, with deaths down 65% since peaks, hospitalization down more. Vaccines are due in weeks.

1323155760768000000 2020-11-02 14:51:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ossoff They need to arrest Kamala Harris, then, because she's suppressing the Democrat vote. Democrats are all voting for Trump this year because of it.
1323155233531461632 2020-11-02 14:49:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @FoxNews The Kamala-Biden campaign is suppressing the Democrat vote. You Democrats can vote for Trump! Nothing stopping you. Join the fun!
1323154212763611137 2020-11-02 14:45:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden is trying to suppress the Democrat vote. That's OK y'all. You can vote for Trump!
1323152122888835073 2020-11-02 14:37:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden hates Pennsylvania. He hasn't campaigned there more than 20 minutes, has he? Trump spent days there going to hundreds of cities, towns, road crossings. He loves the place! He went to college there.  If you live in PA, you'd be a traitor not to vote for Trump.
1323059767678521345 2020-11-02 08:30:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @wolfblitzer You caused it by lying for five years straight about Trump being a racist and Russian spy. You should be ashamed of yourself and CNN.
1323058579415465984 2020-11-02 08:25:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JHMcGinn @mattgaetz The economy is already bouncing back, up 33.5% third quarter. Help Wanted signs are up everywhere in my area. It will be back fully as soon as travel comes back Spring. Vaccines will be here in weeks.

1323056161210380289 2020-11-02 08:15:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @mattgaetz We won't let him be President.

1323022934806568960 2020-11-02 06:03:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden promised to lock down the entire country back in August. Nothing new here.

1322969498568269833 2020-11-02 02:31:22 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Irene's historic high note. She was the only Red Velvet member who could reach it. It is like a high-pitched shriek in the Halloween season hit "Really Bad Boy."
1322967233212067852 2020-11-02 02:22:22 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Driving down the road with a Trump flag or American flag is not violence.
1322967014172987393 2020-11-02 02:21:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Attending a Trump rally is not violence.

1322966616951394309 2020-11-02 02:19:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> There are no violent Trump supporters. That is not even a thing. The only violence is from left-wing rioters looting and burning, and their media personalities lying to encourage them to riot.

That requires a strong economy, too. So we need to balance the two.

Get out and vote for the safety of our country, to stop the Democrat takeover of our federal courts, to prevent a socialist dictatorship.
1322823766532071424 2020-11-01 16:52:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @nypost They need to spend their resources investigating the Biden Riots. Driving near a bus is  legal. It is perfectly safe until a Democrat drives into your lane and tries to run you off the road. Violent Democrats need to be prosecuted.

1322774195810480129 2020-11-01 13:35:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Can you believe Daniel Dale at CNN fact checked this? He has to be mentally deficient. Remember when they fact checked "hamburgers piled a mile high?"  Yes, Daniel, a Rolls. They want to give illegals a Rolls Royce. 🙄   https://t.co/IzjHj1XU3l
1322653008983896064 2020-11-01 05:33:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> My neighbor's Trump signs. LOL @ "10% for the Big Guy." The Trump signs are suddenly coming out all over. Saw a dozen Trump signs nearby, one tiny, wimpy Biden sign maybe 18 inches wide.  https://t.co/N1BDc6oCUC
1322635778233651201 2020-11-01 04:25:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden is going to lock down the country for years, if he gets in. Any time anyone has a sniffle he's going to lock the whole country down, close the whole thing. We can't have that.
1322607765030883330 2020-11-01 02:33:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Melania has done more for America as First Lady in 47 months than Biden did as a party hack in 47 years of government.

1322604787876171776 2020-11-01 02:22:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @BrendaLeeNY @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump They correct them at the last minute so they can say they were correct next time. Biden never had a lead in AZ.
1322604282911346690 2020-11-01 02:20:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ACVData @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump True. Biden plans to shut down Nevada for three months with everyone required to wear masks, even alone outdoors, and all businesses closed.
1322603582907162626 2020-11-01 02:17:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The truth is that Biden was never ahead.
1322577363050397697 2020-11-01 00:33:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ericcervini Why do you have to come here and call people you don't even know Nazis? We were just having a little fun. Go home if you don't like it.
1322573336401092608 2020-11-01 00:17:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @ericcervini I may have seen them while I was out driving by early voting sites playing YMCA and Proud to be an American real loud. We were just having fun.
1322568537551024128 2020-10-31 23:58:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @13thethe We ran her out of Texas.
1322537669193289728 2020-10-31 21:55:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 I sorta look forward to it because each RV member, especially Seulgi and Wendy, would make a great solo act, as Hyuna did. JOY could play the sexy vamp in K Dramas for the next two decades :) But I would miss their arrangements.
1322536843552894977 2020-10-31 21:52:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 If that KPop book is correct and contracts are 5-7 years from debut, RV would need a new one in 2021. I'm thinking that is why these controversies are cropping up, like with Girls Generation and F(x). SM is about to debut Aespa.

1322510939363696640 2020-10-31 20:09:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC MSNBC is lying once again. They cannot be trusted to tell the truth. Here are the facts straight from the Health and Human Services, billions of dollars distributed to hospitals for COVID-19 patients...  https://t.co/utNUSNiiUW
1322508478699679745 2020-10-31 19:59:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Real_Lawson @tomselliott @donlemon I know that most of the science points to masks being effective at cutting down transmissions so, yes, I do know. That's why doctors and nurses wear them, transmissions are lower where they are worn.
1322391083100372993 2020-10-31 12:12:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @PeteButtigieg Democrats are trying to count dead voters.
1322386437610868737 2020-10-31 11:54:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Reuters There are no capacity issues. This is a blatant lie.
1322384851715215366 2020-10-31 11:48:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN Not true. GOP will win both seats.
1322383566030983168 2020-10-31 11:43:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @catturd2 Of course. He's leading by 30 points in China. According to CNN, though, so Trump still might win it.
1322382921311916032 2020-10-31 11:40:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @LucyPreisler False.
1322377195914866688 2020-10-31 11:17:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @lwburwell I have. Usually I get non-followers liking my tweets. The past couple of weeks it's only followers, even on retweets. Also, I'm not seeing the tweets of some people I follow, like Mindy Robinson.
1322375645779939328 2020-10-31 11:11:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden needs to shut down his campaign. He's not going to be President. We won't let him. So, he needs to quit yelling at Americans and scaring children. This has gone on for too long. It's a joke and, frankly, disgusting.
1322360599997808641 2020-10-31 10:11:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Asshole...

1322306123421175809 2020-10-31 06:35:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @DanPennell I would not allow children to watch him screaming about everyone dying, darkness and gloom. He's like a nightmare.

1322298852439937029 2020-10-31 06:06:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Man, I just walked 1 1/2 miles, threw golf discs around in the park, walked back, checked my mail, and that damned Biden is still on TV screaming to the top of his lungs. They are still honking at him trying to get him to shut up. The man is insane.
1322260345684185095 2020-10-31 03:33:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Hearse following Biden bus in Texas.
1322258925450833920 2020-10-31 03:27:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @catturd2 Looks like they are sitting in a cow pasture. I can't think of anyplace else in Texas that looks like that.
1322258383169376262 2020-10-31 03:25:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @kayleighmcenany He's scaring children. He should not be allowed on TV pretending he's going to put them in masks and make them stand in circles. Many children think he's going to make this a dark winter with no sun.
1322257542609805317 2020-10-31 03:22:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I just turned on my TV. Biden is screaming at people sitting in their living rooms. Why? Trump supporters are driving by honking at him to shut up. He's frightening, awful. Kids should not be watching all this screaming.

1322237460651323392 2020-10-31 02:02:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Love it. I was actually hoping Trump would go into Scranton.
1322235638192680968 2020-10-31 01:55:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> If the left thinks their fake polls will dissuade Trump voters and the GOP, they really don't understand us. We vote as a matter of principle and duty. That's what we do in every aspect of life--we show up. That is who we are, win or lose. We do not quit. Nothing can stop us.

Many KPop groups have one style. This one is so different, without JOY because she was filming...  https://t.co/zbqxFjcRTu
1322206993898180610 2020-10-31 00:01:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Good job. All this progress on Middle East peace and keeping Iran from developing nuclear weapons would end, if Biden wins. We must keep fighting for  world peace! Vote Trump for World Peace!
1322203104901812229 2020-10-30 23:46:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @tomselliott @donlemon The science and numbers show New York has around 3 times the deaths per million of Texas, and over double that of Florida. Lemon is just not telling the truth. It is Lemon who refuses to accept the numbers.

1322199695050113024 2020-10-30 23:32:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN CNN is racist.

1322168963443380224 2020-10-30 21:30:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta Cool it with the ankle-biting BS. It's going down, vaccines on the way. The economy is screaming back. Report that and quit whining. We are bringing the country back, defeating the virus!  https://t.co/dVNtS9IXmV
1322167055618113537 2020-10-30 21:22:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Trump will win by 15 points in Texas. I only know one person voting for Biden here, and he's too damned lazy to go vote. They are all pathetic, Democrats. Always looking for handouts.

1321949024291872769 2020-10-30 06:56:22 +0800 <CarlWorsham> What do they do after graduation, if they create a bunch of new genders? All that student debt and their degrees are obsolete.

1321946597526278146 2020-10-30 06:46:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @catturd2 The funny part is when they think the college degreed vote matters. Nope. 70% of the vote or more is not degreed.  That's the part that matters, more than double. You'd think they'd know arithmetic. Advanced degrees count the least.

I guess that is why I like Red Velvet so much... variety. I like that Seulgi's 2 favorites are mine... Bad Boy and Psycho. Russian Roulette is another I like, quite a different style.
1321926952408797186 2020-10-30 05:28:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Biden has no plan that Trump has not already done or is doing.
1321926529761366016 2020-10-30 05:26:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @KamVTV It is not illegal to have signs 100 feet from the polling location. It is illegal to steal them. If we have evidence, we will prosecute them for theft.
1321925730012418048 2020-10-30 05:23:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Trump is already doing that with Operation Warp Speed. It's in the works. There's nothing Biden adds. He has no plan to eradicate the virus that we have not been working on for 10 months.
1321869765758115845 2020-10-30 01:41:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CHIZMAGA Biden is leading in China, though.

1321832873389891586 2020-10-29 23:14:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC And add that 4% plus the 4% Trump is really ahead to every one of these fake state polls.

But, you have no trouble ignoring the one that covers the news from a different angle. You are the one in the information silo.
1321784676315500546 2020-10-29 20:03:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @letsmakechange9 @jeremymwall @Acosta If you aren't advocating for school choice and teaching economics and personal finance in k-12 you have no clue what you are doing.
1321784073342341121 2020-10-29 20:00:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @I8Despotus @jeremymwall @Acosta Biden's business and energy taxes will, in fact, destroy jobs. Biden and his fanboys have no idea how economies work. Their little social study and teacher degrees don't teach that.
1321783063282634753 2020-10-29 19:56:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta Acosta's (🤡) mind reading comprehension hits a new low.
1321780777147895808 2020-10-29 19:47:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Shemtov10 She's far left on her own, but yes, the left wing socialists in her party will run the show.
1321779650465533953 2020-10-29 19:43:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @padremambo @KimStrassel @JZmirak Biden's business taxes would cost jobs, lower wages, make our products less competitive in world markets. His energy taxes would raise utility and gasoline prices. They are middle class tax hikes. The middle class and poor are hurt the most. He's not fooling the astute.
1321777811489722370 2020-10-29 19:36:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Shemtov10 True. Biden is a Trojan horse to sneak socialist Kamala into the Presidency.
1321777254641373185 2020-10-29 19:33:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden's campaign strategy to run against George Bush is failing. He's losing ground to Trump for the Presidency, not gaining anything on Bush in his North Carolina Senate race.
1321770505272238081 2020-10-29 19:07:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden needs to quit talking about "plans" when everyone knows his only plan is to nap all day.
1321731496462422017 2020-10-29 16:31:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @PragDreamer @MiaFarrow Really? Wow! Has any President in history been nominated more?

1321647298334593024 2020-10-29 10:57:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CHIZMAGA Yes, there are multiple copies of everything spread over a number  of people.
1321637379619381250 2020-10-29 10:18:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MiaFarrow Trump has three Nobel Peace Prize nominations. What do you think, dimwit?

1321606470090240005 2020-10-29 08:15:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SoCalTrucker_ Bold faced is a more modern adaptation, but is not the usual nor most accepted form.
1321606134411780096 2020-10-29 08:13:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Son_of_Gman @uliekmattkips @natakinz17 @SenSanders No, idiot. My son graduated only 2 years ago, is a systems analyst, debt free. You're just lazy. We both worked all through college.
1321596454553735169 2020-10-29 07:35:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Juliekins9 My profile picture is me with a Japanese group. The big guy on the right composes anime music and formed the group for the Magical Girl anime. The one with the X is the lead singer and plays the magical girl character.
1321592292977889287 2020-10-29 07:18:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @jaketapper What kind of idiot poll includes 119 unlikely voters this close to an election, especially with such a high percentage who already voted? Trash polling!

Anyone can start a lawn service in the Summer, wash cars, etc. They are looking for handouts. Best Buy is another who works around a college schedule. They and Amazon offer tuition reimbursement. My son got $3500 checks for tuition each year in addition to pay.
1321576047054409729 2020-10-29 06:14:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Juliekins9 I'd like to go and take the KPop tour. It would be fun. Almost went, then Covid hit. Maybe next year. I got to see my favorite group perform at SXSW... I walked in, they were performing this:  https://t.co/CauMdUTU4v

1321572238592790530 2020-10-29 05:59:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @bvttz @uliekmattkips @natakinz17 @SenSanders I had no trouble finding jobs framing house, in lawn care for motels, soldering wires 40 hr/week every summer during college.
1321571671644524544 2020-10-29 05:56:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @bvttz @uliekmattkips @natakinz17 @SenSanders Home Depot, Container Store warehouse, Amazon, Fedex, iFratelli's Pizza, any construction company in the summer--just a few near me.
1321570728605601795 2020-10-29 05:53:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ElanTheDragon We don't know.  They are having trouble now because airlines can't afford to buy airliners. Any bailout will likely only reduce the damage, not eliminate.  BA at $150 is a buy with substantial upside longer term, not a quick return. LUV will do better over the 12 months, IMO.
1321567866370576388 2020-10-29 05:41:47 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @uliekmattkips @natakinz17 @SenSanders You could change jobs. There are special programs already to help the handicapped with education and other needs.
1321556573882376193 2020-10-29 04:56:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @uliekmattkips @natakinz17 @SenSanders Work 40 hours a week. I only worked around 25 during school, but 40 in the Summer and even dropped out to work a year. My son worked even more than I did. You can do it if you actually put in the effort. I know that from experience!
1321555460936372224 2020-10-29 04:52:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @natakinz17 @SenSanders Exactly. Both me and my son worked throughout college. It helps a lot!
1321555097848078337 2020-10-29 04:51:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SenSanders I paid for most of my college and my son's with cash. Do I get a check, too? If not, is what you are scheming fair? Of course not. Go to hell.
1321554141324496898 2020-10-29 04:47:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps @MilesTaylorUSA I don't know what the problem is. An electric fence would work. You don't have to turn it way up, just enough to give them a little shock.
1321551641536040963 2020-10-29 04:37:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ElanTheDragon True. Buying at $150 here should work. That 7 year backlog of orders should come back over time. LUV may double before BA?
1321550610269904903 2020-10-29 04:33:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @youbigbang1 @mominxy @allkpop No. That is too harsh. But she should learn to behave herself and not be such a prima donna. I think they should make Seulgi leader for now. Seulgi has a positive, upbeat temperament, more maturity.
1321548594164412418 2020-10-29 04:25:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HarlequinRV @mominxy @allkpop No. Everyone does not lash out. Most people try to be nice to those working for them. I made coffee for the guys trimming my trees last week. That is how you are supposed to treat people.
1321547520766582787 2020-10-29 04:20:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ElanTheDragon I have old shares at $80. This is a good price, but airlines have to come back first. Get LUV and maybe swap them for BA later? Airlines can't afford many new planes for awhile. A year?
1321545276667158528 2020-10-29 04:12:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @politicsbySteve @LarrySchweikart @buzzskill_2000 Austin has always been weird, just a larger cesspool of liberalism now. The rest of the state is bigger, too. Don't think our Hispanic population is leftist. Not hardly. 1st and 2nd generation, maybe, but there are far more who have been here a long time and are conservative.
1321533608927133697 2020-10-29 03:25:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> My followers are disappearing. Just noticed a bunch missing. I'm posting the same sorta stuff, and all are people who liked my posts before, just about. Though, most never respond to my KPop idol posts 😀 I just like music.

I knew it could not be Seulgi, so it adds up. Irene is just a spoiled brat, which does not look good as she turns 30.    https://t.co/jW9iLbOemr

1321107565779058689 2020-10-27 23:12:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> This Trump rally on Youtube has 57,000 hits, around 25,000 in the audience. Doesn't sound like much, right? BUT, it's one of like six Youtube feeds and he did what? Four rallies in PA? Millions yesterday saw him! Correct my math!
1321105539892432905 2020-10-27 23:04:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Watching a Trump rally. He's best when he goes OFF the teleprompter. And he's going waa-aay off! Biden is decent if he stays ON the teleprompter, a failure when he leaves it. Tells you a lot!
1321080376819929091 2020-10-27 21:24:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @djrresto @PeteButtigieg Hugo Chavez and his cronies  turned Venezuela into a totalitarian state by packing the courts. No thanks, loser.
1321079837730156544 2020-10-27 21:22:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @PeteButtigieg Pete, please, that is just how our Constitution works. You need to understand it, why you and your Democrat pals are not qualified to hold office. Here, read this:  https://t.co/nAbgNlUSF2

1321075773357367296 2020-10-27 21:06:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @splasn @MSNBC MSNBC will be state news if Biden wins. All other news sources will be made illegal.
1321075121306611712 2020-10-27 21:03:47 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Packing the courts was Chavez's way of turning Venezuela into a totalitarian state. The radical left also wants to stack the Senate by making Puerto Rico and DC states, and allow mass immigration. This is a socialist take-over that Biden's few remaining brain cells can't stop.
1321072614769598464 2020-10-27 20:53:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Packing courts was Chavez's path to turning Venezuela into a totalitarian state. It can happen here.
1321072458989031424 2020-10-27 20:53:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Many seem clueless that Biden is the Socialist's way into the castle, a Trojan horse. His mind is shot, he would not be controlling the shots.
1321066084208955394 2020-10-27 20:27:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @AmylouiseDonne1 @JoeNBC It's not fiction. He couldn't care less about the Lincoln Project. He doesn't even know what they are. His mind is shot. The radical left will control his agenda. His brain is nearly gone and he can't stop them, just what the radical left wants.
1321064546174455808 2020-10-27 20:21:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC Biden has one foot in the grave and is functioning on a limited number of brain cells, which is obvious to all. Radical socialists led by Kamala and AOC will control his entire Presidency, if he wins.
1321062255933444096 2020-10-27 20:12:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC This is all part of the Democrat scheme to use COVID-19 to  throw the election into chaos and use their 600 lawyers to steal the election.
1321053465964122112 2020-10-27 19:37:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MarianIvan19 True, they all follow the same paths to gain totalitarian control. One is to stack the courts.
1321052256150630400 2020-10-27 19:32:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Sagesayer1 @MSNBC Oh, bullshit. Read the constitution. We followed it to the letter. Excellent Supreme Court pick!

1321051435468021761 2020-10-27 19:29:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC She has no understanding of the constitution. Pelosi is not even qualified to hold office.
1321050568031436803 2020-10-27 19:26:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @dana_hatch @MSNBC Seriously. Can't believe he's a Texan. Totally embarrasses the entire state. I know Texans who voted for him and are now ashamed of themselves for being misled. I try not to rub it in.
1321049532445188100 2020-10-27 19:22:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @dana_hatch @PattyMurray Whip smart is an excellent description. She really gave me hope in our future as a country. If we can produce minds like that, we did good.
1321042402015121409 2020-10-27 18:53:47 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @msfella Thank-you, bunella, for retweeting that post. I already lost one follower because of it, but I'm serious. If we learned anything the past four years, it's that we need to reign in Washington and govern our own states. Our states are different, but all Americans First.
1321038017679761410 2020-10-27 18:36:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> One reason I hope Trump wins is that we can build a larger Republican coalition based on his populism and America First priorities. I want it to include: -- Smaller national government -- More local control -- Lower federal taxes -- Fewer regulations -- Fewer laws More later.
1321025832786235393 2020-10-27 17:47:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @mynropmail @manlygumdrop @GregNorberg @ATHE1STP0WER My cousin's son maintains them. He charges a lot of money :)
1321025452245471232 2020-10-27 17:46:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @manlygumdrop @GregNorberg @ATHE1STP0WER That's what dollars are for. They are a measuring stick for comparison. Take the total cost of the installed windmill, wiring, maintenance and lifetime output and compare it to the wholesale price of the same amount of cogen natural gas produced electricity. It's a loser.
1321023385934221312 2020-10-27 17:38:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @manlygumdrop @GregNorberg @ATHE1STP0WER You forgot the wires to remote location, maintenance and are assuming the wind blows more than it does.
1321022272119951363 2020-10-27 17:33:47 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustinM79380965 @GregNorberg Not even 25%.

1321019814610161664 2020-10-27 17:24:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @PattyMurray No one was jammed into the courts. The President  nominates justices, the Senate has the option to confirm them. It is the standard constitutional process.  Here, read this:  https://t.co/nAbgNlUSF2
1321007959216955392 2020-10-27 16:36:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ImpatientCatX1 @CNN No he didn't. Read the article. Trump put sanctions on China for human rights abuses.
1321007500498448384 2020-10-27 16:35:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN What we know is nothing will get done to help the Uyghurs or Hong Kongers, if CCP bootlicker Biden is elected.
1321006094316163072 2020-10-27 16:29:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @IvankaTrump @dougmillsnyt Beautiful picture of this historical moment, Ivanka. Thank-you for sharing it.

1320998637724405760 2020-10-27 15:59:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Chavez and his cronies solidified one-party totalitarian rule by packing the Venezuela Supreme Court. That is precisely what Democrats plan to do to our country. Stop them NOW, before it's too late.    https://t.co/nRiY1zkE3m

1320987980669112326 2020-10-27 15:17:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC No one cares what Beto says in Texas. He has no significance here.
1320983914467467264 2020-10-27 15:01:22 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden admits it in the open...
1320981573060218880 2020-10-27 14:52:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @atastypizza @ScottAdamsSays No, if they already voted they ask them how they voted, not how they are going to vote, silly. Use your brain.
1320980272960229377 2020-10-27 14:46:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Democrats are lying that Trump has no coronavirus plan. The second big heading under his official second-term agenda is:  ERADICATE COVID-19  Right after JOBS! That is waaay better than Biden's plan to wear masks and live in plexiglass cubicles.
1320978745361125377 2020-10-27 14:40:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Trump's 2nd term agenda looks great to me...   https://t.co/WyAKiS6GhD

1320942496877334528 2020-10-27 12:16:47 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Melijojo1959 Biden would end these investigations, if he wins.

1320923278345670658 2020-10-27 11:00:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps @razorbackintex1 Total outrage not one Democrat voted to confirm.
1320923000926064642 2020-10-27 10:59:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps Democrats hate our Constitution.
1320922776178405377 2020-10-27 10:58:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Good stuff. Chris Cuomo is trashed good. Deserves more. His brother killed 11,000 seniors putting covid infected people into nursing homes.
1320921523096616961 2020-10-27 10:53:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> They will destroy our country with mass immigration, a federal take-over of energy, healthcare and education (indoctrination), gun confiscation and shit like this to centralize power in the hands of the few in their permanent political class, just like every despotic regime.
1320917916381028352 2020-10-27 10:39:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @PebvVan It would be a disaster of federal excess and control over our lives.
1320917426863808514 2020-10-27 10:37:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> We have to stop them! Imagine packed courts, a packed Senate, millions flooding into our country, a federal takeover of healthcare, energy and education, gun confiscation, massive unemployment and poverty, unlimited taxes. That's what Democrats want.
1320913250511429632 2020-10-27 10:20:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RepAdamSchiff If Democrats win (big IF), pack the courts (58% oppose), and destroy the economy with their New Green Deal, they will lose all power and cease to exist as a political party. The time to stop them is NOW!
1320911959156576257 2020-10-27 10:15:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> If Democrats win (big IF), pack the courts (58% oppose), and destroy the economy with their New Green Deal, they will never have any power again and cease to exist as a political party. The time to stop them is NOW!
1320909574459764736 2020-10-27 10:05:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @satoxtwo @NBCNews The only Russian collusion was Russian spies giving Steele disinformation for the Clinton financed dossier. Now Putin is openly supporting Biden.
1320899414244892673 2020-10-27 09:25:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> And with that ACB declares her independence from political interference, something Democrats deplore.
1320883746304917504 2020-10-27 08:23:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @TedJoy71 Nope. Mao was disgusted he did not know about the crop shortages. He believed his people and not the information we gave him from our aerial observations.
1320882885281406976 2020-10-27 08:19:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Democrats are shit.
1320865725704261632 2020-10-27 07:11:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I didn't know this. Biden voters need to know they may be able to change their votes.
1320863439271743488 2020-10-27 07:02:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> In China's system of government no one wants to present bad news to the top, no one at the bottom can act. By the time word of the virus trickled up to the central committee and Xi, it was too late. Same reason millions of Chinese starved during their Great Leap Forward.
1320850376812335104 2020-10-27 06:10:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN @ddale8 CNN viewers need to read this. CNN lies all the time by leaving things out that everyone else knows...  https://t.co/x9ggDaCzUN
1320849711033700352 2020-10-27 06:08:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> "It is flabbergasting that as of last week Stahl did not know that the Department of Justice’s Office of Inspector General verified that the Obama-Biden administration spied on the Trump campaign."
1320845031637475329 2020-10-27 05:49:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden wandered off the campaign trail and got lost.
1320739543872581634 2020-10-26 22:50:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden has essentially dropped out of the race. He can't handle even a sparse campaign schedule.
1320729515035865088 2020-10-26 22:10:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN Biden said he's running against George Bush for Senate. He dropped off the campaign trail today in disgrace. Likely won't be back.
1320728858153361411 2020-10-26 22:07:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden thought he was running against George Bush for Senate. He had no chance of winning.
1320713367649136645 2020-10-26 21:06:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden knows the polls are wrong, is off the campaign trail today, essentially withdrawing from the race in shame.

1320496939423748096 2020-10-26 06:46:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC The CDC has been politicizing the virus. It would be good if many quit and we replaced them with medical professionals interested in the science and saving lives instead of playing politics.
1320495082173353987 2020-10-26 06:38:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Very unlikely. Biden is physically unable to do the job. You can't nap days on end as President. He just does not have enough stamina. Now we see he was selling the VP office to the highest bidder.
1320494278540464129 2020-10-26 06:35:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @cnnbrk @CNN Biden won't win. By now everyone knows he's physically unable to do the job, sleeping days on end, not able to speak more than 20 minutes. Now we see he was an influence peddler selling his office.

1320439888257470467 2020-10-26 02:59:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN Uh... I think they discredited themselves.
1320438889463582721 2020-10-26 02:55:38 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @BGOnTheScene They should take your advice and offer donuts.
1320435782193192960 2020-10-26 02:43:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 😀😅😄She looks like a street wino flailing her arms and yelling at random strangers, wagging her finger at them. Needs to be locked up to protect the general public who only wants to vote on peace!
1320434837141016585 2020-10-26 02:39:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @bstovalljr Biden will suspend all laws, it looks like. He will confiscate guns, arrest people for not wearing masks. He even wants to steal our social security.
1320434180258471939 2020-10-26 02:36:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> How can Gov. Whitmer be so ungrateful after it was Trump's FBI who saved her from kidnapping, that fraud?
1320419385429950465 2020-10-26 01:38:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Horrible. They want to imprison us, if we don't wear a mask. He said outdoors or indoors! Do they plan to go into homes? What about this gun confiscation?
1320373661359099904 2020-10-25 22:36:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Who else will Biden call a chump? Kamala is yelling at people standing in line to vote and shaking her finger at them, like some drunk wino on a street corner. The only chumps are those voting for lying Democrats.
1320372825379786752 2020-10-25 22:33:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN Anyone who thought we would not have around 300,000 ir so deaths from this under a best case scenario is not very bright. Anyone blaming Trump for a virus that started in China and spread to every corner of the world, is a brainwashed chump.
1320364505801625600 2020-10-25 22:00:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Where I live we have noise ordinances. No one much minds the occasional teenager blasting thumper music from his car, but if it gets bad we can call the police. They will make them turn that it down, if a neighbor's warning doesn't work.  As a result, we have peace.
1320362851438034946 2020-10-25 21:53:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> 😀😀😀  No one knows who she is. They are ignoring her.
1320361203206676480 2020-10-25 21:46:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @BlessUSA45 They all have their backs turned to her. They don't know who she is. Maybe she should bring donuts.
1320360398881771520 2020-10-25 21:43:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps She should follow a food truck around to find crowds.
1320352998900596738 2020-10-25 21:14:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @monicawooden Yes! CA has rolling blackouts, triple prices for electricity, and the highest gasoline prices in the country. All those windmill blades are made from oil, anyway. Even solar panels use plastic from oil.
1320351779146633217 2020-10-25 21:09:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Buden said we would have to wear masks all the time, even outdoors alone, for three months! CRAZY! These Democrats are mean, totalitarian grouches, need to be put in straight jackets and hauled off to an insane asylum.
1320351381262422016 2020-10-25 21:07:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Wow! Biden was literally yelling at people in PA,  scolding them for voting for Trump, calling them all chumps. That's not how to win friends.   He threatened to force people to wear masks outdoors, and even threatened to put them in plexiglass cubicles.
1320131441854959622 2020-10-25 06:33:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @TANK_Patriot @cjtruth @dantheman9701 @FabioQanon True. I think Vermont will go to Biden, unfortunately, and mess it all up.
1320124255611375621 2020-10-25 06:05:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @RealJamesWoods Of course not. He still thinks he's running for Senate. He lost the last set of car keys they let him have a long time ago.
1320118105083908097 2020-10-25 05:40:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @RealJamesWoods @JoeBiden He plans to take a nap. Paulino made me a burger at Coppell Deli. I love that guy. Yum!  https://t.co/V8zPBAnwvv
1320108265229910020 2020-10-25 05:01:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @realDonaldTrump He would need a pencil to draw a crowd.

1320073236349059073 2020-10-25 02:42:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @DonaldJTrumpJr The only chumps are those voting for Biden. He can't even stay awake, sleeps in his basement for days. He knows nothing about PA. That was 66 years ago, and he can't remember that long. His mind is shot.
1320072343373467653 2020-10-25 02:39:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @realDonaldTrump I'm surprised you didn't get 100%. What was that stupid stuff Biden said about plexiglass? Is he going to make us wear masks jogging outdoors, AND live inside plexiglass?  Does he know it's made from oil? Does he have some deal with his Chinese handlers to buy plexiglass?
1320067435689578497 2020-10-25 02:19:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Notice she does not talk about the cruelty of coming into our country illegally and taking from working class Americans or dragging their kids along and dumping them here. Why doesn't she write about the 485 separated from their children who won't take them back?
1320012178867523586 2020-10-24 22:40:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MakeMnRedAgain2 @KZ4TRUMP @RealAPolitics With early voting and all the precautions, I don't see why anyone would just mail it in. I voted, it was not crowded, spacing was good and we had disposable styluses to make selections. I wore my American flag mask. It was very well run in Dallas County, TX, where I voted.
1320008365137866756 2020-10-24 22:24:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RaefDLF @ScottAdamsSays Do you have answers or are you just carping?
1320008062984507394 2020-10-24 22:23:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Good thread to pass around or copy the link and paste it in response to smears.
1320007564097093633 2020-10-24 22:21:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ScottAdamsSays Dick Durbin said Trump used the term "shithole country." No one else there backed him up, and seven there said they did not recall Trump saying that. I think the odds are high Durbin lied.
1319999475247702017 2020-10-24 21:49:33 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ScottAdamsSays @ClassicMvieLuvr Nope. It could be near 95% already where it matters.
1319989878453604354 2020-10-24 21:11:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC @kavitapmd Trump never said we have a cure. He said regeneron was like a cure for him. Big difference. He's just amazed how quickly it helped him to get over it. Quit being an ankle-biting jackass.
1319969259099951104 2020-10-24 19:49:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Here is all the proof anyone needs that the entire Biden-Harris campaign is based on lies...   https://t.co/e5U7L1kZdP
1319968391755665408 2020-10-24 19:46:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNNPolitics The authenticity of Hunter's laptop has been confirmed, not only by the DNI, FBI and DOJ, but by Hunter's business partner who received some of the emails. He links transactions discussed in the emails to Joe Biden.   https://t.co/LbncGDN0J6
1319928287301390336 2020-10-24 17:06:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> PA will become a wasteland if Biden wins. They need to remove all Democrats.    https://t.co/FtvYf5sBFK
1319924658846765056 2020-10-24 16:52:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden's energy plan will double utility bills, create rolling blackouts and drive gasoline prices over $6 per gallon. You can't power a country like this with windmills. It's nuts. Can't be done, as Germany discovered. You need petroleum and nuclear.
1319896016041160704 2020-10-24 14:58:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SayWhatLadies @JackPosobiec Raising minimum wage that much causes some inflation.
1319892794153066497 2020-10-24 14:45:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Mike_Pence My private insurance was cancelled when Obamacare was implemented. I bought an Obamacare policy. It cost 48% more that first year and 252% 3 years later. The deductible eventually quadrupled. My doctor would not take it, so I was forced to change doctors.
1319891331301449728 2020-10-24 14:39:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Wisconsin would go into a depression, if Biden is elected. Everyone knows it.
1319890923581591555 2020-10-24 14:38:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JMH_RULES @SeanPenn I can't see anything different between "Biden's" virus plan and what Trump has already done except that ridiculous national mask mandate.

1319879090887970817 2020-10-24 13:51:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Democrats are upset today that our Constitution says executive power is vested in the President. They hate it when anyone follows the Constitution.

1319805221766336512 2020-10-24 08:57:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @catturd2 He's been advocating a national three-month mask mandate including outdoors since August. Now he says plexiglass is the answer.
1319804528867278853 2020-10-24 08:54:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @twilight_chibi She got her start campaigning for Bernie. She's a socialist. Can't be trusted.
1319796704774934528 2020-10-24 08:23:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Joe Biden does not follow the science! Scientists agree lockdowns do not work. The Biden lockdown plan will harm the country.

1319789040867135490 2020-10-24 07:53:22 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Biden wants to regulate homes now, with mask police.
1319788802399965184 2020-10-24 07:52:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Biden also says he will put everyone in a plexiglass box, even in restaurants. He's insane. Needs to be put in a straight jacket and hauled off.

1319782345185087493 2020-10-24 07:26:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden has no plan to defeat the virus and bring the economy back. Trump is already doing it.

1319661505282002944 2020-10-23 23:26:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Will we have to sit in a plexiglass cubicle from now on, if Biden wins? Wear masks outdoors? Shut down the economy? Glad I didn't vote for him.    https://t.co/DvTE6a1hNm

1319538644357685248 2020-10-23 15:18:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @GregAbbott_TX Texas won't vote for Biden. He slept the past 5 days. Everyone was worried he was dead. You can't do that as President! It was like the Democrats were not ever check on him in his basement until he started to smell. They don't like him, either.
1319533989040967680 2020-10-23 14:59:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> In the debate, Biden said he disagrees with the Democrat Party is why he got the nomination. Who believes that? It's so illogical. The socialists would run everything, if he got elected. We'd go into a depression.

1319497307293913088 2020-10-23 12:34:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden was given the answers to the debate questions, was looking down reading them the whole time. Still he screwed up and lost.

1319487970681016320 2020-10-23 11:57:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> CNN is lying with fake polls, by leaving out the $3.5 million Biden took from Russia, hiding Biden's lies about fracking, his crime bill, the Obama cages and making stuff up about Russia.
1319486859056132096 2020-10-23 11:52:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> MJ Hegar is following the great Democrat tradition of lying her fat ass off in every ad and speech. Cornyn has been a steady, reliable conservative vote in the US Senate for Texas. Gotta vote for him.
1319482313722429442 2020-10-23 11:34:33 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps The unemployment rate has already dropped below what it was the first 4 years of the O'Biden administration, and this during a pandemic!
1319481851145293827 2020-10-23 11:32:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> One thing we know is Biden did not spend the last five days prepping for debate. Lost 74% to 24% according to the snap poll.  Probably napping, thank God. Everyone thought Biden might be dead. We thought Democrats would not go down there to check on him until he started to smell
1319472918489948168 2020-10-23 10:57:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ACTBrigitte Joe just hasn't had the chance, but has been a lying crook longer. Don't let him near the White House!
1319472519930384391 2020-10-23 10:55:38 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @catturd2 Lying and toobin is all they do!
1319472214153039878 2020-10-23 10:54:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RealJamesWoods @brianstelter The press didn't have ethics then spreading disproven Russian conspiracy theories, and is still unethical.
1319471648593088513 2020-10-23 10:52:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @TeamJoe Team Joe. 😀😂🤡

1319470610930716672 2020-10-23 10:48:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @donnabrazile They aren't lies. Why are you lying about it?
1319470163977265152 2020-10-23 10:46:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @twilight_chibi Putin said he supports Biden and the Democrats.
1319464066067345414 2020-10-23 10:22:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Now we know Sleepy Joe wasn't preparing for the debate in his basement the past 5 days. He was napping.
1319463105181736962 2020-10-23 10:18:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta Yep. The smart ones hide from the law to stay here. They need to go back. They are here illegally.
1319460545163071489 2020-10-23 10:08:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta Lies. The children are with relatives or in foster homes. They are better off than being in the Obama cages. Trump got rid of the Obama cages.
1319460011337277440 2020-10-23 10:05:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden built the cages, Trump got rid of them. The children are in foster homes or with relatives now. They'd be in cages if Biden was still VP.
1319454135616417793 2020-10-23 09:42:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Obama-Biden almost destroyed the steel industry in PA. Now it's coming back!
1319453497788694528 2020-10-23 09:40:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ScottAdamsSays Biden's family is like a vacuum cleaner sucking up money around the world while he's VP! 😀😄😁
1319452933180805121 2020-10-23 09:37:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden extorted Ukraine to fire a prosecutor. He admitted it on video! Now he's lying about it! We have video!
1319451602437242881 2020-10-23 09:32:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden is lying about the $3.5 million the Russians gave his son and all the money laundering.
1319451370165075972 2020-10-23 09:31:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta Jim (🤡), go away. You lied with Russia conspiracy theories for 4 years. No one believes anything you say, anymore.
1319450829326290945 2020-10-23 09:29:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden is telling one lie after another and Trump is beating the crap out of him in this debate. Putin said he supports Biden! Look at him lie about it!
1319298320326660098 2020-10-22 23:23:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @trish_regan Thank-you, Trish, for hanging in there with us. It's a boost.
1319298093242847233 2020-10-22 23:22:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> We are bringing this economy back despite Democrat riots and lockdowns. Not let's vote ALL the Democrats out.
1319296899011268608 2020-10-22 23:17:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HeatherIAm23 A nap.

1319268021488275461 2020-10-22 21:23:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @VoterWeb @sfagnew @ScottAdamsSays Nope. The overall death rate is not unusually high.

1319249674881171458 2020-10-22 20:10:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The stock market is one of those leading indicators that tell what is in store for the economy. Looks like we are swiftly climbing out of the COVID-19 slump! Super-V, baby! SUPER-V!  https://t.co/oDF268pMDY
1319246906669805569 2020-10-22 19:59:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Matthew24_Truth @c_tiot Followed you, Matt 😀
1319246612250636290 2020-10-22 19:57:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Right, Sleepy. 390,000 Americans giving their lives to free the slaves wasn't living up to our ideas? Freeing Europe from Nazis and communists wasn't? C'mon, man, quit being an ass.
1319245736408735746 2020-10-22 19:54:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Only 7 people show up to see Obama? No wonder the Dims are spending millions on ads in PA. Get out to vote, Republicans! Need to run up the score!
1319245040204599297 2020-10-22 19:51:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> "Socially distanced cars" 😀 Like a Buick can catch COVID-19. That's a random parking lot, nothing to do with Obama.
1319242589338480641 2020-10-22 19:41:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SkipperJack4 @OPruntyPoetess @MSNBC @MaddowBlog You have 24 followers, Bot. The facts do not support you... the reparations for terrorism, peace deals, increased NATO cooperation, trade deals, hostage returns, rising exports--all show that Trump and our country have much more respect from the world.
1319231351124537348 2020-10-22 18:57:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RonMilnerBoodle @IowaDeplorable I think it was laundered money, but I guess we'll see.
1319230937805324288 2020-10-22 18:55:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @DailyCaller @reneebrown1966 Obama's last year saw only 1.6% growth, the same as the annualized growth rate his entire 8 years, no improvement and the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression.
1319229301175259136 2020-10-22 18:49:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @OPruntyPoetess @MSNBC @MaddowBlog Do you think major peace deals in Serbia, Kosovo, Bahrain, Israel and UAE, Sudan paying victims of terrorism and NATO allies paying their fair share means our status has diminished? Hardly. Quit being duped by fraud Maddow, chump.
1319214879178395651 2020-10-22 17:51:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SenKamalaHarris The Senate passed a bill, an excellent one. The House should vote on the Republican bill. Pelosi is blocking all legislation to help with COVID-19  because she does not care about America, only power and her special interest spending sprees.
1319214111247446018 2020-10-22 17:48:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @AustinW93269231 @MSNBC Admits what? That the Hunter Biden laptop is not part of any Russian disinformation campaign? The FBI said it wasn't.  The misinformation is flowing from MSNBC. Quit being duped, chump.
1319204861821538304 2020-10-22 17:12:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @joey_the_dog @JoeNBC The only violence is from the left... antifa, blm, rioters and looters on the streets. It is not coming from peaceful conservatives sitting at home watching the disasters unfold  in our Democrat-run cities. It's not coming from church goers and rotary club members.
1319203422957174785 2020-10-22 17:06:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC You keep ignoring the news, Joe. You are a fraud...  https://t.co/oaiPMwHynS

1319202482933932039 2020-10-22 17:02:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN Was it normal for Obama to let ISIS fester? To do nothing about Russian incursions into Crimea, Syria and Ukraine? To let China build a fortress in the Spratly Islands counter to international law?  To preside over the worst economic recovery since WWII? Obama is a paper tiger.
1319200573875433472 2020-10-22 16:55:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @nomad2003 Unfortunately, it is actually good politics. She has no designs on higher office for the next 10-15 years.  Those kids will be voting by then. It's like Pepsi advertising to teenagers... those customers will be around longer than us old guys.
1319199389613740032 2020-10-22 16:50:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> It should be obvious by now that AOC and Ilhan Omar are out to destroy America. Make no mistake, if Biden is elected, they will be running the show. Biden and Pelosi will be gone soon, with The Squad taking over the House!  https://t.co/fDHqEJJOKk
1319174724920971264 2020-10-22 15:12:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @realDonaldTrump Biden's economic policies will cost the country 13 million jobs. We will never recover. Don't stop the Super V !!!
1319174298301587456 2020-10-22 15:10:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Democrats are a bunch of no jams, grouchy scolds. We will make America greater than ever with a positive attitude, belief in our constitution and freedom, and hard work! Let them pout and gripe. We will keep our country the greatest ever, with or without them.
1319169260170731520 2020-10-22 14:50:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Blue state lockdowns are harming the recovery. I can't help but think they are doing it on purpose. We must remove ALL Democrats from government!   https://t.co/LdFnGCqWVQ
1319155417457610754 2020-10-22 13:55:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Law and order and the economy are more important to our country than the virus long term. We know the virus will be defeated, but we cannot risk the violence in our cities or the destruction of our economy. The Democrat policies will kill our recovery!
1319154161892589571 2020-10-22 13:50:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The virus is waning. Deaths down 68% since April, 36% since August, hospitalizations down 70% or more. Once it's gone, what then? Do you want a career political hack who sleeps all day in the White House? We are winning the covid fight. Without an economy we are hosed.

1319149589501513728 2020-10-22 13:32:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @PolitiFact Biden promises to raise business taxes. Those taxes make it hard for companies to hire, expand and give raises, just like during the Obama era. That and regulations is why we had such pathetic growth for eight long years. Worst recovery from recession since the Great Depression!
1319143530107985922 2020-10-22 13:08:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @leb20082016 @LegendaryEnergy Remember when Trump asked Russia to give him Hillary's emails from her illegal server as a joke? I laughed and laughed at that. But, the idiot Democrats took it seriously. "Russia, if you're listening..." LOL
1319140579486408709 2020-10-22 12:56:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @leb20082016 @LegendaryEnergy And, gee, is it a big lie to say hamburgers were stacked a mile high?  Or that the economy is growing 3% instead of 2.9%? Most of Trump's "lies" are designed encourage out country to be great. Can't fault that!
1319138935000436739 2020-10-22 12:50:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Another reason Biden isn't qualified to lead this great country!
1319137451844247552 2020-10-22 12:44:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @PolitixGal I agree. The very minimum any society needs is peace, law and order, and the Democrats can't even provide that in our cities. Without a functioning economy, nothing else works!
1319135939185250304 2020-10-22 12:38:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> When you see Trump coming home from work night after night after long grueling hours you know he loves our country. Meanwhile, Biden is hiding in his basement taking naps all day.
1319135128409546754 2020-10-22 12:34:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @NATIVEg8r @DanScavino When you see Trump coming home from a long day at work every night you know he loves our country. Meanwhile, Biden is hiding in his basement taking naps.
1319129563587366914 2020-10-22 12:12:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Money laundering? I wonder who was on the receiving end? Sleepy?   https://t.co/3ai4TMUoQe

1319127910066868224 2020-10-22 12:06:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @KamVTV @JoeBiden You'd think a minimum qualification would be to be awake most of the day.

1318979026489430016 2020-10-22 02:14:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @bette_oh The DNI said it was real, and the FBI said they wouldn't change anything the DNI said. I agree it would be nice to have an announcement because Fake News will just drown out the story with their usual BS or ignore it. It's hard to get the truth out.

1318970043049365505 2020-10-22 01:38:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I guess no one is going to check on Biden in his basement until he starts to smell.

Operation Warp Speed promises vaccines by the end of the year. Everyone has access to testing, we never had shortages of hospital beds, equipment, supplies or food on the shelves.

She had to send her other two kids to that same school because she had no choice. Parents should be allowed to choose which school is best for their child.

In fact, we should have private accounts for social security instead of the system we currently have so we can invest for growth and better jobs instead of just moving money around.

1318897412442828802 2020-10-21 20:50:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden Biden offers nothing, just promises to do what Trump has already done and adds a bunch of taxes.
1318897196494966784 2020-10-21 20:49:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Sleepy's entire campaign is based on Fake News ginning up enough hate to get angry Democrats to the polls while he naps.
1318892171974639616 2020-10-21 20:29:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @meenaharris Trump is a much better dancer. Kamala is so lame.
1318891905640521728 2020-10-21 20:28:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Oh, my... Kamala just can't dance. Trump is much better. This is really lame...
1318888040497057796 2020-10-21 20:13:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @FullVapor Is he even alive? I guess we'll find out tonight. I'd suggest he's hiding from the press, but they won't ask him anything about the laptop probe. Probably napping.
1318887373749538818 2020-10-21 20:10:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN Has CNN checked on Biden to see if he's OK? No one has seen him for days.
1318886862459703296 2020-10-21 20:08:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Biden has been napping in his basement five days now, supposedly. Is MSNBC the least bit curious whether he is even alive? Whether he has the health and stamina to be President?
1318883478130335745 2020-10-21 19:54:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> DOJ reportedly agrees Hunter Biden emails are not Russian disinformation...  https://t.co/SrncuXHdmf via @nypost
1318878702567030784 2020-10-21 19:36:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC @MaddowBlog The FBI said Hunter's laptop is NOT Russian disinformation.
1318876985645502466 2020-10-21 19:29:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC @FrankFigliuzzi1 MSNBC seems more interested in harmless conspiracies theories than the crimes uncovered on Hunter Biden's laptop. The FBI just said it is not Russian disinformation.
1318875783402868737 2020-10-21 19:24:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Garyatty @SeanLangille @JakeBGibson The FBI determined Hunter's laptop was not Russian disinformation. You must be thinking back on Clinton's dossier she purchased from Steele.
1318874999843848193 2020-10-21 19:21:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC Scarborough doesn't seem to be concerned at all about Hunter's laptop revealing crimes connected to Biden.
1318867620012187648 2020-10-21 18:51:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @AP If they got "caught up in the moment" and set fire to police cars, tore down statues, destroyed businesses, they aren't "regular citizens." They are criminals.

1318854715023699968 2020-10-21 18:00:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 There's something really messed up about this story. Normal parents would do anything to find their child.

1318846993339437058 2020-10-21 17:30:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Trump is fighting covid, bringing the economy storming back, making campaign stops, and creating a new dance craze while Biden naps for days on end. Which one is fit to be President?

1318805781215666181 2020-10-21 14:46:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Particle96 @atensnut Are they ever happy about anything?
1318805190926020608 2020-10-21 14:43:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @NancyEHoffman2 @JoeBiden The left is always claiming the science is settled, but science is rarely settled. We will not know much about this virus, masks, which country did well, best therapies, vaccines for quite some time, likely after it is long gone.
1318801159314984961 2020-10-21 14:27:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WreckOfOld97 @atensnut Nope. She was nominated for VP.
1318801000736694274 2020-10-21 14:27:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @atensnut They can't reassign the votes cast for Biden to another person. They are stuck, and must suffer the consequences of nominating a corrupt politician.
1318796437988249600 2020-10-21 14:09:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @lahabran @daughterofagnes I voted early to avoid the crowds and still had to stand in line.
1318792246284685312 2020-10-21 13:52:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpeakerPelosi Lies.
1318792048397475840 2020-10-21 13:51:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> He's an embarrassment to the country. Both he and Kamala need to resign from the race to restore honor to our government. They represent the self-serving corruption that has taken over politics.
1318789823386275841 2020-10-21 13:42:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden A President has to weigh the economy, negative medical effects of lockdowns, national defence and a myriad of other considerations, not just epidemiology, before making these decisions. You are not bright enough to understand the big picture, not qualified to be President.
1318787131960102913 2020-10-21 13:32:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden should recuse himself from the election until the laptop probe is completed.
1318786543125991425 2020-10-21 13:29:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> More! Millions will lose their job. This econimic recovery from coronavirus we are experiencing will be crushed. Bidens business taxes will eliminate jobs.
1318785807105347584 2020-10-21 13:26:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ABC Yeah, this is why ABC campaigns 24/7 for Democrats--they give you more ad money. We know your little game.

1318764996025896960 2020-10-21 12:04:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @satoxtwo @JoeBiden Only Biden took money from the CCP.

1318758818025775109 2020-10-21 11:39:38 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden Trump and Pence have done every one of those things except mandate masks. He left that to states. Joe has nothing to offer but plagiarism.
1318757127901597697 2020-10-21 11:32:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Trump will be President the next four years. It's time Schmitt accepted the 2016 election and quit acting like a deranged idiot.
1318602433610895366 2020-10-21 01:18:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> One thing we learned the past couple of weeks is Democrats don't even know how the Constitution works. Have they ever read it?
1318601979602632706 2020-10-21 01:16:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ProjectLincoln Biden naps in his basement half the time. No one has seen him for three days. Is he even alive? You can't put a lid on the Presidency. He is not mentally or physically fit to be President. He's a joke.
1318601293729046534 2020-10-21 01:13:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ProjectLincoln After Obama-Biden doing nothing about Syria, Crimea, ISIS, E. Ukraine and the Spratley Islands, how much more will Biden concede to Russia and China? He's a foreign policy disaster. Why Putin supports him and the Democrats.  https://t.co/AZ1JF8pQC3
1318599409140178951 2020-10-21 01:06:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @politico What are their names or it never happened. Is it McCabe, Comey, Strzok. etc?  Lots of "former senior officials" after Trump got through with them. There will be more during his second term, why you are scared.
1318598493414543362 2020-10-21 01:02:33 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 @brianstelter I'm pretty sure all the CNN and MSNBC perverts are toobin behind their desks all the time. He just got caught.
1318597959190237186 2020-10-21 01:00:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN Biden has been napping in his baseball for three days. No one has seen him. Is he even alive? You can't call a lid on the Presidency. He's not physically fit to be President and his mind is shot. No one in their right mind will vote for him.
1318596395570466817 2020-10-21 00:54:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC No one else is going to vote for Biden. His mind is shot. He can't campaign half the month, taking naps in his basement most days. No one has seen him for three days now. He's not physically fit to be President.  He's a joke.
1318588960902422528 2020-10-21 00:24:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @EmeraldRobinson 25? It looked like 6 to me.
1318588160755093504 2020-10-21 00:21:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @w_terrence Napping in his basement.
1318586673815572485 2020-10-21 00:15:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MAGAGwen @artledoux0 Because she promises to follow the radical left socialist agenda.

The report specifically said they had no evidence any American, including Trump, conspired with Russia. You might consider reading it again. The exonerate part Mueller admitted in testimony has not place in law.

1318579085325512704 2020-10-20 23:45:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @jarvimom @brianstelter Because Biden is a foreign policy train wreck.

1318573089672790018 2020-10-20 23:21:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump I like Trump's personality. He likes the work, unlike Biden who naps in his basement for days on end. Trump is the only one who can keep this massive recovery going. Biden will kill the economy with lockdowns and taxes, lose jobs, wreck businesses.
1318572486561304576 2020-10-20 23:19:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump 50 Cent is welcome to bring his money to Texas. He creates lots of jobs wherever he goes.

1318571560278642692 2020-10-20 23:15:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SenSchumer I can get a test at three locations within 2 miles of me. Anyone who needs one can get one. What the hell are you tweeting about? Go away. No one needs you.
1318571001089826817 2020-10-20 23:13:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Can you believe lying Adam Schiff is blaming the Bidens treachery on Russia, without one shred of evidence, as usual? And who are these "former FBI"  employees who say it looks like Russians? Strzok? Comey? McCabe? Page? All creeps. The Bidens appear guilty as sin. No denials.
1318556013893767177 2020-10-20 22:13:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> You can't put a lid on the Presidency. Biden isn't fit for the job. He spends half the month taking naps in his basement.
1318555337906098176 2020-10-20 22:11:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> When was Biden last seen in public? Is he even alive?  https://t.co/Pos0ULZOIz

1318535210674409472 2020-10-20 20:51:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @sivanandagirl It isn't population density. Cuomo put COVID-19 patients in nursing homes killing 11,000 and spreading the disease. Trump gave him a Javits Center hospital and the USS Comfort to use, and he did not use it.

1318527247591112704 2020-10-20 20:19:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> NY, NJ, CT and MA clustered together have 11% of the population and 28% of the deaths. Compare that to TX, FL or CA who did much better. That is nearly 3 times as bad as the rest of the country. Cuomo sucks.
1318523997622050820 2020-10-20 20:06:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> As you can see at the CDC website, the hospitalization rate for COVID-19 cases is way down, by about 70% from peaks. This can only mean cases are milder.  It appears to still be slowly going down.   https://t.co/TcbphoPKIM
1318520272157331457 2020-10-20 19:51:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> US COVID-19 deaths are down 67% on the 7-day moving average since their peak last April, 36% since August. That means we are protecting our most vulnerable and the virus is waning. Cases are milder with lower hospitalizations.
1318519814508433408 2020-10-20 19:49:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> New York has the second highest death rate in the US, only after nearby New Jersey they infected. They have three times the death rate of Texas and over twice Florida's. Cuomo is a liar and a killer.
1318518366445969410 2020-10-20 19:44:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC COVID-19 deaths are down 67% on the 7-day average since their peak last April, 36% since August. That means we are protecting our most vulnerable and the virus is waning. Cases are milder with lower hospitalizations.
1318515808172232705 2020-10-20 19:34:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RepAdamSchiff When are you going to admit that Trump had nothing to do with Russia? Your years of investigations did nothing but PROVE Trump was clean. Putin supports Biden and the Democrats.  https://t.co/AZ1JF8pQC3

Trump's job entails more, like saving the economy, making sure the shelves are full, we don't panic, national defense, thinking of the future past Covid. Trump has to balance it ALL, and is doing great!

1318503994294177796 2020-10-20 18:47:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Hell, yes they plan to punish us. With their policies! Read Biden's tax plan. He "claims" he's not going to tax the middle class, but what about all those huge business taxes? They will kill jobs, make it hard to give raises, just like during that wimpy Obama recovery.
1318492690267373569 2020-10-20 18:02:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Lying CNN says the Trump family never wears masks. No true...  https://t.co/UeHVTjraB9
1318482756989583360 2020-10-20 17:22:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden will destroy millions of jobs. We'll never recover. Only the Trump agenda will keep this record recovery rate going!
1318474995715198976 2020-10-20 16:51:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SilkDharmaArt It's ugly. Tear it down. Trashy.
1318473151119020032 2020-10-20 16:44:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden is a foreign policy train wreck.
1318470299239723008 2020-10-20 16:33:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Trump's second term agenda is the best agenda in history. And with Trump, you know it will get done. He won't be napping five days in a row like Biden is.  When he says he works for America every day, Trump means work, not hide in his basement napping.   https://t.co/WyAKiS6GhD
1318453602692829189 2020-10-20 15:26:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @BeJoyTOG @NYGovCuomo New York has the second highest death rate in the US, only after New Jersey. Cuomo is a liar and a killer.

1318453153407340544 2020-10-20 15:25:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @cajunali @NYGovCuomo Then why does New York have three times the death rate of Texas?
1318452851039981568 2020-10-20 15:23:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @NYGovCuomo The death rate on Florida is waaaaaay lower than New York, loser. 11,000 dead NY seniors are your fault.
1318442877492596737 2020-10-20 14:44:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @NRO He's level headed. Pulling out of TPP was a bad idea. It reduces China's competition. Cornyn is right about that. Cornyn is more conservative on economic issues than Trump.

1318429295421816832 2020-10-20 13:50:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @hapa_girl33 Biden said he'd force people to wear masks outdoors, too, like jogging alone or whatever.

Guys who fought and died for their freedom and yours, and later died to free the slaves? Entitled? No, dear, they earned the right to create the constitution and live free, paid  with blood and treasure.
1318422506458533890 2020-10-20 13:23:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @PeteButtigieg The founders are who put the ability to amend the constitution into the constitution. What goes against the constitution and originalism is legislating from the bench, not making amendments.  You aren't very bright, Pete.

1318303892191457280 2020-10-20 05:31:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> How much money does the media make off political ads? And do they slant the news for the highest payer? The Democrats outspend Republicans. Seems to influence the "news."

House Democrats made a laughingstock of themselves. Biden never mentions it. Totally embarrsssing, looked like idiots.

Even the Ukraine President and their foreign minister said there was no pressure from Trump. Fact: Biden extorted Ukraine to fire a prosecutor. It's on video on youtube.
1318009136659992576 2020-10-19 10:00:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Remember Biden said he will force everyone to wear masks, even outdoors? Why doesn't the press ask him about that? I'll wear one in a crowded store, but while I'm outside jogging alone? Playing disc golf? Is he an idiot or what? He's a hateful old grouch. Not fun like Trump.

Trump brought unemployment down to a record 3.6%, increased GDP growth, and is doing it again. Trump and Cornyn created prison reform to free those who Biden gave long, unfair prison sentences for non-violent crimes.  And, the virus is on the run.

1317779625674756096 2020-10-18 18:48:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The GDP growth rate was only 1.6% in Obama's last year in office. In fact, it was only an annualized 1.6% Obama's full 8 years. No improvement, and that was following a recession when growth rates historically are far higher. Worst economy since WWII.

1317679878469259266 2020-10-18 12:12:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Alyssa_Milano Biden's tax increases on businesses would reduce the ability for them to hire, give raises. You will see layoffs, lower pay. Biden's energy taxes increase gas and utility prices. The worker will be hurt terribly by Biden's tax policy.

1317642970431184897 2020-10-18 09:45:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @sherree_r When he starts yelling he has to be losing votes. I guess that's why they keep him locked in a basement.

1317640657960394754 2020-10-18 09:36:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps Congressional Democrats need to be imprisoned for conspiracy, all those who voted to impeach, including Nadler who needs to be forced to run laps around the White House.
1317639478253703169 2020-10-18 09:31:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Can we try all Democrat legislators for conspiring to cover up crimes? They were running interference for the Biden crime family the whole time.  Swalwell for sure needs to be cuffed and hauled off to jail in disgrace.
1317636489682014208 2020-10-18 09:19:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HarlowGina @RyanAFournier This is the stupidest and most disgusting post on the internet today. I feel sorry for you, you pathetic, heartless ass.
1317635943747231745 2020-10-18 09:17:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @GovWhitmer Feel lucky Trump saved your ass. I wouldn't have sent in the FBI.
1317634678921302016 2020-10-18 09:12:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Russia likely bribed Biden to run hoping they could con him out of another Syria, Crimea or East Ukraine, like when Obama was President. If you don't want Holland or Delaware to fall into Russian hands, you better vote for Trump.
1317633113397317632 2020-10-18 09:06:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> There may be some CNN viewer all fired up to go to a Biden rally. Then he gets there, is assigned a circle, and becomes completely deenergized by Joe's grouching, just endless depressing scolding and complaining. Biden is deenergizing his base. He's nothing but an old grouch.
1317630292660785155 2020-10-18 08:55:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ProudPa21956142 Yeah, he couldn't tell a joke like Bush or Reagan, but at least he would try. The whole country was miserable for 8 years with Obama as President. It will be worse if we let Biden win. Can you imagine 4 years of Kamala's whining, too, with that nasally tone?
1317490326773313545 2020-10-17 23:39:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN The only one guilty of crimes is Biden, and you won't even report it.

1317486443195977728 2020-10-17 23:23:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Someone tell Kamala no one thinks she's funny. Maybe she will stop cackling after everything she says. Biden and Kamala are the dullest politicians in history. Low IQ bores, the worst. Can you imagine those two for four years? Awful. No fun.

1317484147003228161 2020-10-17 23:14:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC It was funny, too. Trump has a positive attitude and good sense of humor, unlike Biden the grouch, the first candidate for President who can't even tell a joke.
1317482997961076738 2020-10-17 23:09:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Can you imagine her nasal whine mixed with that cackling, nauseating laugh for 4 years? At least she's a grouch only half the time. Biden is a grouch 24/7. Neither can tell a joke. Kamala just thinks she can. She laughs at all her jokes. No one else does. She's not funny.
1317480738388955136 2020-10-17 23:01:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden Biden is such a grouch. He never even tells a joke. Have you ever seen that, a candidate who can't tell a joke? He doesn't even know how, just an old grouch, with no sense of humor, a no jams scold. No fun. Trump is fun, and happy.
1317479351420620800 2020-10-17 22:55:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden can't tell a joke. Have you ever seen him tell a joke?  As much of a sour puss Obama was, he could at least tell a joke once in awhile.  Every President in history could. Biden is an old grouch. We can't have a President who has NO sense of humor. Not a grouch like Biden.

1317396388532150272 2020-10-17 17:25:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Joe Biden is a grouch.
1317395825186713600 2020-10-17 17:23:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> If you aren't watching Trump's rallies, you are missing out on a lot of fun, humor and... dancing? Yes, dancing. He loves his job, loves being with the people, loves our country and is good at running it. He will end the virus, and is already bringing the economy back.
1317369433912938496 2020-10-17 15:38:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Wow. These people should be rounded up and put in jail, rehab or an insane asylum. Why aren't they at work? Are they on drugs? Why does Portland not care about them? Why do they allow them to destroy themselves and hurt each other?

Big businesses carry large debts they pay with cash flow. The banks aren't worried or they wouldn't loan it to his family's business. His sons handle his business now.
1317363952637169664 2020-10-17 15:16:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @joncoopertweets You can't know what that means unless you compare it to assets, cash flow. You show a rank ignorance of business. About all corporation carry huge debt. Real estate is a very debt intensive business. Think of it like carrying many mortgages. You just have to make the payments.

In one period of questioning, he asked about her kids. In others, he asked a lot of questions about law. You are incompetent and unprofessional, and a liar.

1317355473839050758 2020-10-17 14:43:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @PaulHartNYC @KamalaHarris Because our Constitution requires them to select Justices for the Supreme Court.

1317335986972524544 2020-10-17 13:25:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden called this West Point grad, MBA graduate of Penn State and the University of Michigan, war veteran, AH-64 Apache pilot and successful business leader, a "disaster." God, I pray John James gets into the US Senate.

Businesses will have to give their money to government, not allowing raises. We will be less competitive in trade, exports will decrease. That's the worst part. Fracking is bad, too.

1317277192364150785 2020-10-17 09:32:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Melania would make a great President, if she could run. She has more leadership skills, love for our country and our youngsters, concern for our future, than any Democrat.
1317275667600412672 2020-10-17 09:26:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The socialists say Trump has no healthcare plan. As usual, they are lying. Here's an article about it, with a link to his plan. He's implemented what he can of it. We need a conservative legislature to implement it all. It's a great plan empowering states.  https://t.co/JPtvcz9RdH

Trump did a good messaging job. I think it may have helped. He only needs to move the needle slightly.

1316951056824344576 2020-10-16 11:56:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden Your "plan" is stuff Trump has already done. Deaths are down 65% since April, new medications are working, Operation Warp Speed is bringing us a vaccine, and the economy is in a massive recovery. We do not need you to mess up our recovery and great comeback!

1316943221579223040 2020-10-16 11:25:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden Instead you plan to tax businesses so they can't hire as many people, can't give raises and must raise their prices to cover the extra tax costs. It still hurts workers! Many will lose jobs. You are a shifty liar whose business taxes will hurt the poorest workers the most!
1316939970913964032 2020-10-16 11:12:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @thehill What do you mean by "happening." I suggest you read the IPCC reports, the science parts. It says no increases have occurred in floods, droughts, hurricanes, tornadoes, no species extinctions they can attribute to climate change. I have the quotes if you need them.
1316938689713479681 2020-10-16 11:07:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @heirloomjewls @RadioFreeTom @unfuck_america It must be hard for you to adjust to the real Donald Trump after being fed a pack of lies about him. Cognitive dissonance can be brutal.
1316937964048519168 2020-10-16 11:04:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @judgnaut @RadioFreeTom Because it was the truth, and you are used to the lies about Trump. I recommend you pay attention to what he actually says, and not what you've been told he says. Quit groping to find faults. That woman just liked him. Isn't that OK?
1316937025405276161 2020-10-16 11:00:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RadioFreeTom She just can't help herself. Everyone gets excited and finds they agree with him when they hear our President speak. More people need to listen to what he really says, not what Fake News tells them he said, quit  shutting him out. He really loves our country.
1316927063639678977 2020-10-16 10:20:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> At least Savanah was partially truthful. In the middle of what was supposed to be a Trump Town Hall right before cutting to a commercial she said "Great DEBATE, let's get right back to it."  It wasn't supposed to be a debate. She made it one. It's on Youtube.
1316844001132187648 2020-10-16 04:50:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @morg787 @ScottAdamsSays I first started noticing that in ~2008 trying to learn more about climategate and global warming. Google was definitely favoring warming in its results and burying the climategate email scandal.

1316827986059034624 2020-10-16 03:47:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @everlovinaddie @Ginny__Wilson @CNN It's not just the $600,000 per year the Bidens got from Burisma, adding up to millions. What about the $3.5 million Hunter got from the Moscow mayor's wife, the $1.5 billion from Chinese investors? Chump change?  That's just what they got caught doing.    #InfluencePeddling

1316801146493771776 2020-10-16 02:00:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> What did China get for all that money they gave Hunter? The Spratley Islands? The West Philippines Sea? Would Biden sell them Taiwan and Japan, too?

1316731036269772800 2020-10-15 21:21:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Justice Barrett has been explaining our Constitution to the Democrats for several days, and they still don't get it. Now the Republicans are explaining it. Ted Cruz is talking real slow, and they look totally baffled. Will they ever catch on they just  don't have the votes?
1316727465545551872 2020-10-15 21:07:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @DanRather The process for changing the constitution is an amendment.
1316727076238626828 2020-10-15 21:06:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Kamala Harris said she's going to hold Republicans accountable for following our Constitution.   OK.

Sadly, many there looked like Democrats, slouching, picking at their masks, looking confused. We must vote in droves!

1316538621705543680 2020-10-15 08:37:22 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Voted today. 4 offices in Dallas County are uncontested Democrats! We can no longer vote straight ticket, must select individually, skip over uncontested Democrats. I saw many voting who looked like Democrats, dressed sloppy, slouching, picking at their masks. We must turn out!

1316519519628779521 2020-10-15 07:21:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> It has never been a conspiracy theory. The press is full of left-wing assholes spreading lies and propaganda, always has been. It gets worse every year. They no longer teach journalism, just how to lie and get away with it.
1316486715490566146 2020-10-15 05:11:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Kamala is disqualifying herself from being VP by bullying our next Supreme Court justice, lying, name calling and threatening. She needs to withdraw from the race immediately.

1316311096937132032 2020-10-14 17:33:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @enzoro53 @MSNBC Seriously? Do you really think anyone would believe you over the doctors at Walter Reed hospital? Even MSNBC viewers aren't that stupid. The are stupid, no doubt, but no one is going to believe you.
1316284095798931456 2020-10-14 15:45:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden Their voices were heard in 2016. Trump's term has not expired. They were heard again in 2018 when the GOP added to their Senate majority for confirmation. Yet, you say the people don't "deserve" to know who you'd choose as a judge before voting. Who the hell are you? A nobody!
1316278562169802752 2020-10-14 15:23:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC John Podesta? He's a DNC propagandist, racist and liar, an old Clinton family political hack, definitely not a doctor. That MSNBC uses a partisan conman like him as a source on medical issues shows they can't be taken seriously as a news organization.
1316276986055196672 2020-10-14 15:17:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @kylegriffin1 MSNBC lies all the time.  It's a crap company with no morals, full of low IQ liars and corrupt propagandists.

1316251060772761601 2020-10-14 13:34:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Liar says she's for fracking now. No, they aren't. Never were, never will be. Democrats will destroy the natural gas industry, and there simply is not enough space for enough windmills and solar panels to power America. They will destroy the countryside.

1316238196733284353 2020-10-14 12:43:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Trump is bouncing around happy, energetic, holding huge rallies, speaking for hours, so Democrat trolls are like, "He never had it," like we are going to believe nimrods on Tw¡tter over Walter Reed's top doctors! These people are desperate, delusional, hopeless. So pathetic.
1316219753631973383 2020-10-14 11:30:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden No you won't. You'll never be President.

1316215755176898561 2020-10-14 11:14:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle921 And they have yet to help any of the dead who vote for them!

1316211422796414976 2020-10-14 10:57:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @estafford1948 @MSNBC It has cost me $22,000 more than my old policy since it went into effect. My deductible went from $1500/year to $6600. People paying for it hate it, including employers. If you get sick you have to pay the $6600 deductible. No one can afford it. It's trash legislation.
1316204766402433026 2020-10-14 10:30:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden There's nearly a dozen cars there. Wow.

1316199826137251841 2020-10-14 10:11:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC ACA tripled premiums, quadrupled deductibles. It is crap legislation even Democrats on it hate. Hardly anyone can use it with its $6600 deductibles. It reduced healthcare. It needs to be replaced with something better that is actually affordable, and only Trump can get it done.

I actually like him more than Cruz, who likes to grandstand. He's right 99% of the time, but could dial back the intensity.

Lots of weirdos and flakes in the Senate. It's like an insane asylum. How can Cornyn even stand to be in a room with them? He's a reasonable, thoughtful man among a pack of maniacs.
1316067705116557312 2020-10-14 01:26:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MZHemingway Let them ramble on. Some may see it and realize they elected idiots. Whitehouse needs to be removed.
1316067246867873792 2020-10-14 01:24:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> If Biden can only get 6 people to show up to his events, he needs to drop out. The press and pollsters need to quit humoring him. He has no chance of winning this election.

We are making great  progress. At least four months of immunity is expected:   https://t.co/se1pVJCTwu

I read an article in it that said global warming would increase the number of insects. Nowhere did it say it would increase the number of birds that eat them, just illogical assumptions throughout.

The facilities Trump provided were there to be used as needed. Cuomo could not manage that? He needs to go. New Yorkers look stupid electing him. Kick him out!

1315799107450085376 2020-10-13 07:38:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN CNN lied all week about Trump being on his death bed and needing to be removed via the 25th Amendment.  Turn on your TV. Does he look dead to you? More proof CNN is a cesspool of deceipt, can't be trusted, lies every day.

AOC will probably be Treasury Secretary. She'll steal everyone's money.

1315512048525217793 2020-10-12 12:38:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden is not a leader. Leaders don't hide in basements, cower behind a mask, chew out citizens, scold the country and say we don't "deserve" to know what his policies will be. Biden does not deserve to be our President.
1315508113517223936 2020-10-12 12:22:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden We need a President who does not look up at everyone from his basement, does not cower behind a mask, whine and scold, one who leads like Trump,  who will finish off this virus and continue our V-shaped recovery.

What does Trump do? He starts in about how we have the greatest military in the world. LMAO! Don't get any ideas space aliens!

Or, do you just not understand basic economics?  https://t.co/Ag8uQ7nwOr
1315359223811895297 2020-10-12 02:30:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @BetterAmerica20 @Acosta If you are implying the WHO and CDC did not change their position on masks you are wrong.
1315358647166345219 2020-10-12 02:28:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @crrasher @DanielleCandela @Acosta It's not happening. He's being hysterical. Needs to chill.
1315358367225966592 2020-10-12 02:27:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @DanielleCandela @Acosta Nope. Not near 1,000. Deaths have decreased 68% since April. The virus is waning, Trump fast-tracked therapies that are curing thousands, a vaccine is near, and the WHO just said Biden's lockdowns do more harm than good.
1315352943437197315 2020-10-12 02:05:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @LizDoe6 Many came here to escape the CCP, though.
1315350138261508098 2020-10-12 01:54:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @stillgray Assault. He should prosecute.
1315348853852438528 2020-10-12 01:49:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta Are you pretending to be a scientist now? All you do is spread disinformation, Acosta (🤡).
1315345604336406528 2020-10-12 01:36:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar Yes, but he was released from the hospital, doing fine.
1315344956261892096 2020-10-12 01:34:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @1Aplus2A I was pulling for him 😀
1315339413833109505 2020-10-12 01:12:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> This or not voting are the only intellectually honest options for misguided Never Trumpers. A vote for Biden is a vote for Kamala's New Green Deal, open borders and nationalized healthcare. Better for all is to vote Trump, of course, but Never Trumpers are too hateful.
1315337172061433857 2020-10-12 01:03:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Sleepy has seen better days...
1315336764177944580 2020-10-12 01:01:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden's idea to lock down the country again is looking more stupid by the minute, now that the WHO says lockdowns causes more harm than good. It could double world poverty, cause increased child malnutrition, according to a scientist I'm watching now.
1315335763027013634 2020-10-12 00:57:38 +0800 <CarlWorsham> If Chris Christie can survive COVID-19, was it ever that bad?

1315314650356035584 2020-10-11 23:33:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The lockdown simps do not understand we must look at ALL the science, not just the parts that fit their politics. We have economic science that says lockdowns hurt incomes. We have health problems caused by lockdowns. Trump had to weigh it all.   https://t.co/2yvAUVqBb9
1315311477482573824 2020-10-11 23:21:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC The science is following Trump. The WHO scientists now say lockdowns are bad, hurt the economy and hurt the poor the most, just like Trump said months ago...  https://t.co/dsQBYTX8Dx

1315308421151948801 2020-10-11 23:08:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> So much for following the science. The science is now following TRUMP! The World Health Organization says stop the lockdowns!

1315129042027282432 2020-10-11 11:16:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Because Biden is a liar and a coward.
1315124176982859778 2020-10-11 10:56:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden Your numbers are way off. And your solution is to shut down the country again and force everyone to wear masks? That won't work. The virus is waning and vaccines are here soon. No more cowering!
1315122787812626432 2020-10-11 10:51:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JasonJacquet3 @JoeNBC Biden did not denounce Richard Spencer's endorsement personally. Only a low-level campaign staffer did. He never disavowed Putin's glowing endorsement of him and the Democrat Party.
1315116556020572160 2020-10-11 10:26:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> It's obvious Biden wants to control both the executive and judicial branches of government by adding six justices to the Supreme Court, or he'd tell voters he's not going to do that. Kamala already said she would.
1315114888273031171 2020-10-11 10:19:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden This coming from someone who skated by on a government check his entire life accomplishing nothing.
1315111780243435521 2020-10-11 10:07:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC Yes, they know the chances of  peace are gone if Biden is elected. Meanwhile, Putin endorses Biden and you say nothing, and Biden still has not personally disavowed neo-Nazi Richard Spencer's endorsement.

1314841400819814400 2020-10-10 16:13:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @dbongino Biden admits he will raise business taxes.  Businesses pass along all tax costs to consumers of their products and services. To adjust businesses will raise prices, cut wages or lay off, harming the middle class.
1314838193800466432 2020-10-10 16:00:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Mark37318024 The leftists always want to say they follow the science, but when I drill down into the science bits of the IPCC reports they admit we've seen no effects from climate change so far. They offer only highly speculative predictions of little merit.
1314827591858237441 2020-10-10 15:18:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I uncovered another Kamala debate lie. She blamed floods on climate change. From IPCC AR5: “In summary, there continues to be a lack of evidence and thus low confidence regarding the sign of trend in the magnitude and/or frequency of floods on a global scale.”

1314824366530715648 2020-10-10 15:05:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @pinkshagcarpet @dbongino Because that is not true.
1314822495099379712 2020-10-10 14:58:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN Anyone who blames Trump for a virus that started in China and spread to every corner of the world has to have her head examined. It's the most uninformed, unscientific take on the internet
1314821658708979712 2020-10-10 14:54:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> No doubt. Pelosi is already drawing up plans to remove Biden. They are humoring him, making him think they want him as President for now, with designs to put Kamala in charge.
1314820376560578560 2020-10-10 14:49:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Do not walk through that door. On the other side is socialism. If they win, they plan to remove Biden. Kamala will pack the courts to form a socialist regime, with AOC, Beto, Schiff and Swalwell, an unending nightmare.  https://t.co/Nop1Zoelzt

1314522726233669638 2020-10-09 19:06:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden said he's going to the virtual debate anyway, without Trump there. He'll probably lose.

Businesses can raise prices, pay lower wages or lay off to pay them. No other choices! All business taxes are passed along to the consumers of their products and services. It's a hidden tax on the middle class.

1314392944577740800 2020-10-09 10:31:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @you_aintblack I wonder if Kurt Godel's loophole in our constitution was court stacking. He never said what it was, but claimed there was flaw in our constitution that could lead to tyranny. We need an amendment to limit the size of the Supreme Court!
1314391987659968514 2020-10-09 10:27:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The packed courts can rule anything congress passes is legit... ANYTHING! Congress could create states from thin air to pack the Senate, too, and a packed court won't stop them. Court packing is a formula the Democrats will exploit to create a one-party state like China or Cuba.
1314390925800624129 2020-10-09 10:23:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Damn, the more we analyze this, the more lies we find that Kamala told. I spotted three biggies, and here's a fourth lie. Clown face Kamala lied every time she opened her mouth.

1314384447865790464 2020-10-09 09:57:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden Your business tax increases will cost jobs, lower wages or prices go up. There are no other options. That is just economics. No one should be fooled by your lies and hidden taxes on the very working class people you PRETEND to support!
1314383829801594880 2020-10-09 09:54:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @EnguinVinny @JoeBiden Either prices go up or they lower wages. I've read both. Either way, the working class Biden pretends to support don't make out when business taxes are raised. Jobs are lost, wages lowered, prices go up.
1314381932269121536 2020-10-09 09:47:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Alyssa_Milano Trump already did everything in Biden's plan. Too late.
1314377439724929024 2020-10-09 09:29:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JustMyStyle2026 Now everyone should be able to see why our founders rejected parliamentary government! The temporary whims of a radical House of Representatives can result in chaos and lead to a violent revolution. That is also why each member only gets two years.
1314375334519865347 2020-10-09 09:21:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @kirkfletcher @leyles7 @kingpazn @ScottAdamsSays It's to the point I have to quit responding to the dopes who believe the fine people hoax. It causes me to start cussing and calling them awful names. I can no longer control my temper. You can identify the people in an information silo by whether they believe that lie.
1314374300917477376 2020-10-09 09:17:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Chris23703 The others are Twitter polls, but he claims to have selected them randomly. If the difference wasn't so stark, I would not put much credence in this, but the fact all the Twitter polls are similar makes me think something is up.
1314372938678796291 2020-10-09 09:11:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @nomad2003 My cousin's son repairs them. It's a full-time job and he's busy year-round with overtime. Imagine what cost that will add when they are 30 or 40 years old.  That is not factored into their numbers. Often they use capacity, not actual output in their erroneous cost figures.

1314336278717104133 2020-10-09 06:46:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @PiedViper @justjuwon @AndreasShrugged The blinking, twitching in her seat, and staring down at her desk seem to show she knows she lied.

1314330623813849093 2020-10-09 06:23:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @AOC You do not want the laws changing frequently with the rise and fall of every radical group that pops up, or to benefit only states and cities with large, dense populations at the expense of small states. That's a formula for chaos and revolution. Study history.
1314321767071182850 2020-10-09 05:48:22 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Looks to me like the alleged kidnap plotters had more in common with Biden supporters. Their leader disliked police and lived in a basement.   https://t.co/KCxp65yMBY

1314273313368297475 2020-10-09 02:35:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RealJamesWoods Kamala obviously had all the questions and she still lost the debate.

1314248878032654336 2020-10-09 00:58:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @KamalaHarris Yet your ideas about how to solve the problem are exactly what Trump already did.

1314242687801995265 2020-10-09 00:34:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @DonaldJTrumpJr For many women, a man trying to get a word in edgewise is mansplaining. It means "shut up." If a woman can't win in the arena of ideas, she has no business being in politics. It is not a surprise that conservative women never have trouble with "mansplaining," only liberals.
1314240290811711489 2020-10-09 00:24:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @AOC Does Kamala plan to stack the court?

1314076199136751616 2020-10-08 13:32:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Every time Kamala Harris opened her mouth last night she lied.
1314075695186939904 2020-10-08 13:30:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Pence was right! Kamala Harris LIED about hurricanes, according to the IPCC:  "No robust trends in annual numbers of tropical storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes counts have been identified over the past 100 years in the North Atlantic basin."
1314073957092466690 2020-10-08 13:23:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @AOC @Mike_Pence Not for long.
1314072819303682048 2020-10-08 13:19:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Kamala lied about the environment. CO2 levels are declining in the US.  The US is the world leader in CO2 reductions thanks to natural gas from fracking.  https://t.co/Kd97m2EfGJ
1314072140493225984 2020-10-08 13:16:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @AOC Lies! The US is the world leader in CO2 reductions thanks to natural gas from fracking.  https://t.co/yu3MLYf1L7
1314070225420251136 2020-10-08 13:08:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Pence caught Harris repeating the disgusting Charlottsville lie. Trump condemned the white nationalists and neo-Nazis at Charlottesville "totally." It's time to put a stop to the lies Democrats tell to divide our country.  Pence set the record straight!   https://t.co/kVrj9PSvSt
1314067652005040134 2020-10-08 12:58:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WayneDoucette @Dreadedhead1 @ScottAdamsSays @VP CNN is not covering that exchange, of course. At least, I have not seen it, yet. Not sure if it will seep through the media filter, but Pence did good.
1314066747327221761 2020-10-08 12:55:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Dreadedhead1 @ScottAdamsSays @VP Yes, we need Scott's vote. Pence had something for everyone, even Scott. 😀
1314066264973811713 2020-10-08 12:53:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ScottAdamsSays @VP Harris blew it by not answering whether she would lock down the economy again and force us to wear masks. Raising taxes and another lockdown are a sure formula for economic collapse.
1314061508855422976 2020-10-08 12:34:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> It's obvious Kamala and Biden plan to lock down the entire country, kill the economy with high taxes  and force everyone to wear a mask 24/7. Kamala won't even answer those questions. Most dishonest woman in politics, worse than Pelosi.
1314048190426030082 2020-10-08 11:41:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @LilianaRose001 Maybe it's that facelift?
1314047615701528576 2020-10-08 11:39:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @astradyne2112 She is! I felt that, too. She just comes across like she's acting.
1314021181989810176 2020-10-08 09:53:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Kamala is lying her ass off now. She's just making up shit like crazy. Poor girl must be high as a kite, sounds like some street wino spewing bullshit.
1314020246358044672 2020-10-08 09:50:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Kamala already supported a bill that would raise everyone's utility bill $50 a month and gasoline 75 cents a gallon. Thank God Republicans blocked it. Her New Green Deal will triple or quadruple those costs, like France who pays $6 a gallon for gasoline!
1314018592720072712 2020-10-08 09:43:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps When she smiles she looks just like a clown. Needs a big red circle around her mouth to complete the effect.
1314018237496135680 2020-10-08 09:42:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Fact: There has been no increase in hurricanes or tornados, according to the IPCC.
1314013438218326018 2020-10-08 09:23:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Kamala doesn't just act like a clown, she looks exactly like one when she smiles.

1313846386903973894 2020-10-07 22:19:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC He did not reverse course. The GOP has always had a huge $1.6T bill on the table. Democrats rejected it. Trump is just trying to get some smaller things done before we kick the Democrats out in November and can do more.
1313845452924768257 2020-10-07 22:15:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC What "source?" Does anyone believe anyone at the White House will talk to Joe?

1313578571965902850 2020-10-07 04:35:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The Democrat's stated court packing scheme is reason enough to throw them all out of office and vote Trump!

1313443134936842246 2020-10-06 19:37:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @latimes @latimesopinion Trump's Presidency is all about empathy for workers who lost their jobs to outsourcing, saw their premiums and deductibles skyrocket, and got no raises for 8 years under Obama. And, unemployment went down! We don't need lectures from low IQ partisan hacks about empathy.
1313439684240998401 2020-10-06 19:23:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @hopevista Idiot. Trump's entire Presidency is based on empathy for workers who lost their jobs to China, did not get a raise for 8 years under Obama &amp; saw their insurance costs and deductibles skyrocket. And unemployment dropped to record lows. Biden will kill the recovery for more power.

1313283393208057857 2020-10-06 09:02:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @AmandaGLA16 @RNCResearch @realDonaldTrump Just a few words from Biden to call off the dogs would have helped, but instead his campaign staff and Kamala were raising bail money for the rioters.
1313282289430859776 2020-10-06 08:57:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The US economy would go into the toilet if Biden and the Democrats took the wheel. We can't let that happen.
1313276004614496256 2020-10-06 08:32:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Emperor1G @ValaAfshar You are correct. Trains are for freight, planes for people. The US air and freight systems are the envy of the world. No other country comes close, certainly not China.
1313274495285768192 2020-10-06 08:26:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ValaAfshar That trip would take over four hours, if they could maintain that speed the whole way. They can't. Southwest Airlines could do it in around an hour and 40 minutes. Using trains for passengers isn't very smart.
1313273504947728384 2020-10-06 08:22:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> It would take over four hours non-stop, if it could average that speed. It likely cannot. Southwest Airlines could do it in an hour and 40 minutes.

1312930485362929664 2020-10-05 09:39:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> No one does. 63 million votes are in the bag! Let's get some more!

1312925665499459584 2020-10-05 09:20:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Why won't Biden blame the CCP for the virus? They could have told us earlier so we could stop it. How much money have they given the Bidens, again?
1312923182270230530 2020-10-05 09:10:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Why is it that only Republicans cheer when black unemployment is low? Are we the only ones who want everyone to succeed?

1312919599701266433 2020-10-05 08:56:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The Democrat's stated desire to pack the Supreme Court should send a chill down the backs of all freedom loving Americans. Their plan is to create new socialist states and centralize all power in Washington, DC. It's obvious!

1312818943157993478 2020-10-05 02:16:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden would be wiped out the first day, if he caught this.
1312742318420758529 2020-10-04 21:12:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Melania has been a stable voice of reason and courage during these troubled times fighting the CCP virus, even as she has contracted it herself. She is a role model for women across the globe, a true pillar of strength.
1312731416497717250 2020-10-04 20:28:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> If Trump recovers from this, it will be a miracle, a message from God, so we must reelect him.

Read an economics book. The poor are better off in countries with more millionaires.

1312565028248264704 2020-10-04 09:27:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @rpmccombs @tweetofthmoment @armymanssg @JosephNSanberg Expanding the money supply through the minimum wage laws likely would not work very well. Companies would just automate the jobs or ship them overseas.

1312529948200955904 2020-10-04 07:08:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle121 @Nomi_Yukiz I think you'd like it, the book more. Lots of drama! And, it's true! Mao rewrote history so much many Chinese doubt we helped them defeat Japan. I met some shocked everyone in the US had TV in the 50's.
1312528342571122689 2020-10-04 07:01:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle121 @Nomi_Yukiz Lots of history in that book that explains much about China from around 1911 to 1950. Also it's a pretty fascinating story! Many Chinese I've met seem to know the story of the Soong family, even mainlanders.
1312526400692183040 2020-10-04 06:54:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle121 @Nomi_Yukiz Have you read The Soong Dynasty? There's a Hong Kong movie of it, maybe on youtube? It may be entitled The Soong Sisters? It may be hard to understand without the book. I don't know.
1312523850828009472 2020-10-04 06:44:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle121 @Nomi_Yukiz Mao saved his troops to fight Chang Kai Shek.  Then he rewrote history to say he defeated Japan.
1312520689971154945 2020-10-04 06:31:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle121 @Nomi_Yukiz IMO, they bound the feet of  women taking them from the workforce, requiring labor to care for them. European women worked the fields, milked and fed the animals, kept house and many did way more. They contributed to the economy while millions of foot bound Chinese subtracted.
1312519059032821760 2020-10-04 06:25:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle121 @Nomi_Yukiz The CCP blames European aggression. Makes no sense. Why were they so easy to defeat and manipulate? They invented gunpowder, once had ships 5 times the size of the Spanish caravels, fire arrows, rockets, huge armies. What happened?
1312517111806271488 2020-10-04 06:17:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle121 @Nomi_Yukiz China was doing pretty good until around 1300-1500, when they fell behind Europe. My tentative theory is foot-binding reduced their work force by ~30%, but I haven't found enough information to back it up. I think I could, if I wanted to spend time on it.

You can watch them on Netflix or Viki dot com with English subtitles. Little SJW BS, no nudity or unnecessary shocker violence, decent morality. GREAT stories! I recommend starting with Descendents of the Sun.

The rich already pay 90% of income tax so all that's left is the middle class and poor to tax for all their socialist schemes.

I watch them because they have less unnecessary sex and violence, generally have a Christian view of right and wrong &amp; the stars still have the old Hollywood "glamour." ~16 episodes each &amp; I watch around one a month.

1312443924682698753 2020-10-04 01:26:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JosephNSanberg Actually, less than $9.50 if you go strictly by 1960. Where I live about anyone can walk a mile from my house and get a $14/hr job, full time with benefits (warehouse work). Our minimum wage is $7.25. It means little here.
1312440315106660356 2020-10-04 01:12:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JosephNSanberg False. It would be around $9.50.

1312341401024241665 2020-10-03 18:39:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Packing the Supreme Court by adding liberal judges, packing the Senate by adding states, and confiscating guns are all moves totalitarians make to create a one-party state. Democrats advocate all of that. Pollak is correct. They have shown their evil intentions.

1312018462412361728 2020-10-02 21:15:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> At the end Yeri sings Bad Boy, one of my favorite songs, with only her playing guitar. You can hear what a great melody it is without the complex arrangement of the Red Velvet MV. Yerihan Bang (Yeri's Room) is such a warm and cheerful escape.   https://t.co/pwsl0sKddl

1312000836000776193 2020-10-02 20:05:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ScottAdamsSays I love your emotional, subjective approach to voting while you give us tools to take a more rational, objective approach. And, it's not contradictory to your belief we are emotional creatures who only think we are rational! The humor is fun.

1311955040249274368 2020-10-02 17:03:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Backfired on CNN 😀
1311954584160669696 2020-10-02 17:02:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @massbaum @ForeverIdolLove @rosemcgowan So true. The world is nothing like what CNN and MSNBC say. It's a beautiful place. The weather in North Texas was perfect yesterday. The garbage truck driver smiled and waved at me on my way to the park. All the kids coming home from school were laughing and happy.
1311952799962456064 2020-10-02 16:54:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle121 @catturd2 That alone makes up for it.

1311949801609736193 2020-10-02 16:43:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JMH_RULES @Acosta Haha. Maybe they should ask Biden daily why Richard Spencer endorsed him.
1311949284594642944 2020-10-02 16:40:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JuliansRum @Acosta He can't remember what he said yesterday, the fool. Acosta is a clown act.
1311944974079004677 2020-10-02 16:23:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> World markets are down. Like they say, when the US sneezes, the world catches a cold. This tells us what global investors think about how important Trump's leadership is to the world economy.

1311928306091130880 2020-10-02 15:17:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Get well soon, Melania.
1311913273789485056 2020-10-02 14:17:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Praying for our President. Stock futures are down after the news he caught COVID-19, telling us what will happen to the economy, if Trump loses the election. We need his leadership. Pray for his family. He will survive this!
1311790606063153152 2020-10-02 06:10:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @chrisjsmit @stop_sucking_ @CNN @elspethreeve True. We can agree on that.
1311789338947194886 2020-10-02 06:05:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Democrats have showed their cards. It's all about autocratic power and control. They will pack the courts, create new states to pack the Senate &amp; make it where no other party ever has any power. That is their stated objective--total one-party control like a communist country!
1311762381886849024 2020-10-02 04:18:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @jljacobson @MZHemingway No, he said minorities are already 30% of the suburbs and they do not want low-cost housing projects nearby, either. You need to listen better.
1311760098306527235 2020-10-02 04:09:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @chrisjsmit @stop_sucking_ @CNN @elspethreeve Agreed, we don't need it. Unless you've been living under a rock you know most of the rioting has been left wing.
1311759743787175937 2020-10-02 04:07:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @chrisjsmit @CNN @elspethreeve Being violent and being racist are not the same thing. antifa and blm are violent, too.

1311752267322847243 2020-10-02 03:38:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @chrisjsmit @CNN @elspethreeve The founder of Proud Boys is Latino, the current leader black. They have black members and are not racist.
1311745596856950790 2020-10-02 03:11:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden lost the debate so now he wants to change the rules like Democrats do every time they lose. The electoral college, two Senators per state, or nine judges isn't fair to them if they lose. They are like spoiled children.
1311744003684085762 2020-10-02 03:05:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @BeachBoyShimmy @ftuwciktytoeur1 @CNN Biden is whining about the debate rules because he lost. What an idiot!
1311698408076439554 2020-10-02 00:04:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle121 Yes. I ran across her last night while looking up old Supercar songs of all things. One comment was funny, "She's simultaneously cute and terrifying." I love her stage presence... confident, expressive and in command. Knew you'd love it. Off to throw golf discs, pretty outside!

1311670241345318914 2020-10-01 22:12:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN You are lying. Biden said it was xenophobic to restrict travel from China. He opposed it, and would have caused many thousands more deaths if he was President.
1311660936688807937 2020-10-01 21:35:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Rockprincess818 @SenKamalaHarris My deductible climbed to $1500 the first year of Obamacare, then climbed to $6000 four years later. My premiums tripled. For those who pay for it themselves, like me, it's criminal. Your employer hates it because it raised what they have to pay for your insurance!
1311659667152605185 2020-10-01 21:30:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SenKamalaHarris Lies! Kamala has never told the truth in her life. When Trump promises to protect those with preexisting conditions you can trust him to keep his promise...   https://t.co/tlkoFgFst2

1311602925505052673 2020-10-01 17:44:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Koji's voice. Sexy, n'est pas? He's a composer's composer, quite eclectic in style. You can spend all your time listening to Supercar and LAMA and not get bored with their music.    https://t.co/QlZbQ20Awh

1311590891866521601 2020-10-01 16:56:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @morningmika Biden should pull out of the race and concede the election. He is ruining our Democracy.

1311587253676912640 2020-10-01 16:42:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Biden is a global embarrassment. He needs to concede the election.
1311581727475761153 2020-10-01 16:20:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden is a national embarrassment. He needs to remove himself from the race and concede the election NOW!

1311540530300493824 2020-10-01 13:36:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I ran across this. I can support Western Civilization. Science, the arts, democracy all sprang from it and improved the world.
1311537782226120704 2020-10-01 13:25:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I have no idea what they stand for, but they are not a racist group. They should sue CNN for defamation.
1311536732404420608 2020-10-01 13:21:38 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I have also felt Wallace deals equal grief to both Democrats and Republicans, but this time his bias was over-the-top. He treated Biden with kid gloves and played defense for him, interrupting our President 79 times!
1311535468559958017 2020-10-01 13:16:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta Not many people want to flood the country with millions of refugees. We have our own problems.
1311534687622500354 2020-10-01 13:13:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta Biden did so poorly in the first debate Pelosi is begging him not to debate again. Even Joe Scarborough and his half-wit wife want him to drop out.
1311533392924729344 2020-10-01 13:08:22 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Pelosi rejected every idea to help our airlines. After she's gone and we rid congress of Democrats we can get something done to make sure our airlines survive.
1311532323607924736 2020-10-01 13:04:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Navymom0 True, but a lot of people from there commute into NYC. If you subtract the extra inordinate deaths from those few states, the US ranks high on how the virus was handled. It's not like Trump didn't pull every lever to save them, either.

1311513616575758337 2020-10-01 11:49:47 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I can listen to LAMA and Supercar all night. Miki's voice, and Koji wrote so much good music. He is all about perfect arrangements and the sound. He can sing, too.    https://t.co/oJrTqPzlQJ
1311509076577189888 2020-10-01 11:31:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The high death counts in the northeast can all be traced back to Cuomo. It's the only reason the US has bad numbers. Trump sent the Comfort, built a hospital at Javits center, made sure Cuomo had ventilators, all he neeed. Cuomo just screwed up.
1311508027648876545 2020-10-01 11:27:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Chris needs to own up to the fact his brother is responsible for the high death count. He did not protect the elderly. Cruz is right to call him out on it.
1311505271554863104 2020-10-01 11:16:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @joshrogin @OptimusLimited Not much difference. We can just be glad Hunter didn't get any of our sailors killed while high on drugs.

1311343817656799233 2020-10-01 00:35:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden Proud Boys was founded by Latinos. Biden has no clue what he's talking about. His brain is shot.
1311337622279729155 2020-10-01 00:10:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @supitsshekinah It's very confusing to me, but it's mostly the Fake News attack falsely accusing Trump of racism. They just flat-out lie about it over and over. He's not a racist. Far from it.

1311305451129262081 2020-09-30 22:02:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @NancyCallan @HillaryClinton @JoeBiden So Biden telling Trump to shut up was nice? What planet are you on? Biden lied and insulted Trump all evening. Did you just want him to take it? Of course you did, because you are abusive and hateful.

1311303073919389700 2020-09-30 21:53:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @davideisaacson @MZHemingway Get your facts straight.  https://t.co/7KJ4aaRQz3
1311301737823834113 2020-09-30 21:47:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @davideisaacson @MZHemingway Wrong. First when asked last night if he would condemn them, he replied "Sure." Second, because he condemned them in the past he no longer has to repeatedly. Why? Who the hell are you to ask that of him?
1311277674208337920 2020-09-30 20:12:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ZubyMusic The mindset part can be the toughest. I'm struggling with that now.

1311268730354237441 2020-09-30 19:36:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC Now you are groping. 175 out of 800,000 current law enforcement officials? And many more former?  How incredibly asinine. The question was how many police ORGANIZATIONS support Biden. Biden could only look down in shame because he could not name one. Apparently, none do.
1311266973469356032 2020-09-30 19:29:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JonahDispatch I guess you don't  understand the difference between giving people long prison terms for non-violent crimes (Biden) and ending the burning and looting (Trump). Your irrational and indefensible hatred of Trump is showing again, Jonah.
1311266153134731276 2020-09-30 19:26:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC Scarborough and Goldberg don't  understand the difference between giving people long prison terms for non-violent crimes (Biden) and ending the burning and looting (Trump).
1311262233834541056 2020-09-30 19:10:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> An idea that loots and burns...
1311261891038150657 2020-09-30 19:09:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RazerSliced @JamesGRickards Yes. It was for the performers on his reality TV show. It would be like paying to paint a building. The painter or hair stylist pays the tax on that money, not the person who spent it. It's not his profit.
1311260355465801730 2020-09-30 19:03:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ejane2010 @MariaBartiromo @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness The few Trump associates arrested were arrested for crimes totally unrelated to Trump, some committed 10 years ago. Meanwhile, look at those fired and indicted for the witch hunt directly connected to the scam investigation.
1311255023481913344 2020-09-30 18:42:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden Where's your empathy for people who don't want you to shut down the economy, who are sick of you supporting antifa rioters, and who are against court packing and your fraudulent ballot scheme? You have no empathy, Joe! You are a power hungry career political hack. Shut up, man!
1311253048224878592 2020-09-30 18:34:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @davideisaacson @MZHemingway He already condemned them, many times. Read the transcript...  https://t.co/3h0mj66W5a
1311251990396182529 2020-09-30 18:30:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @KirstenPowers Biden made it a mockery. He refused to answer questions about his plan to pack the court, lied with his "fine people" hoax, and told our President to shut up. Read the second box. Biden can't keep lying like this. He lied the whole time.  https://t.co/JrTR3Zb8cj
1311147186315550722 2020-09-30 11:33:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Heck, Biden said antifa is just an ideology, not a thing. An ideology with matches?
1311146576455364608 2020-09-30 11:31:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> We have the official count. My estimate of 40 was close.
1311146192622030857 2020-09-30 11:29:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Things that never happened...
1311145834063503361 2020-09-30 11:28:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Iovemypresident I thought the part where Trump asked Biden to name one police organization who supports him was best. Biden could only look down in shame.
1311140782540296193 2020-09-30 11:08:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RealCandaceO @lucille2482 What do you expect? The Biden campaign paid the rioter's bail, many felons, so they can get right back out of jail to burn and loot again.
1311139848259022848 2020-09-30 11:04:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle121 @catturd2 Or interrupting. Wallace wouldn't let Trump finish and the other Democrat kept talking even though he was boring and had nothing to say. Democrats have no respect for the Presidency!
1311136365686534144 2020-09-30 10:50:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden basically said antifa doesn't exist and he's fine with radical leftists burning America to the ground. I don't know how he expects to win with that attitude.
1311106156404912135 2020-09-30 08:50:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @rruen2 @EmersenLee Nope. I own Southwest stock. Dividends were totally eliminated. The only reason I hold it noe is they have enough cash to barely pay bills and debt payments until the passengers come back. Management cut their own pay.

1311067084357611520 2020-09-30 06:15:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @VickyK42041442 @MSNBC @maddow You run can your business the same as anyone else no matter whether your father is President or a gardener. Perfectly legal to have business loans coming due. Don't be duped by Rachel. She's a shill for the DNC.
1311066057277419522 2020-09-30 06:11:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @gwen_nels @NikkiTa86427922 @SpringSteps @BoKnowsNews Answer Nikki's question.
1311063355814219777 2020-09-30 06:00:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @VickyK42041442 @MSNBC @maddow So? Are Donald Jr and Eric supposed to run the company any different from any other company while their father is President? Why? None if it is illegal. Again, it's very common for businesses to have loans coming due. Big companies have huge loans coming due all the time.
1311052866417811456 2020-09-30 05:18:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Most of us knew this.
1311050084143042561 2020-09-30 05:07:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @AOC Because you are stupid.
1311041823855595530 2020-09-30 04:35:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Rachel takes her audience for fools. Lots of large companies have debt coming due all the time. They pay it or roll it over into another loan. No big deal. They can raise money to pay it with stock offerings, by selling something, using cash, etc..
1311040685798313986 2020-09-30 04:30:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC @maddow She has no proof a debt is leading to bankruptcy. None!
1311040447943512068 2020-09-30 04:29:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC @maddow Rachel is so disingenuous!  Large companies have debt coming due all the time! They just pay it, or roll it over into another loan. They have many was to pay it... cash on hand, stock offering, sell assets, etc. This is no big deal!
1311038605637431297 2020-09-30 04:22:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden No one cares about your taxes. If you are cheating on that, the IRS will catch you. But who is checking you for an earpiece or drugs?
1311026244897603585 2020-09-30 03:33:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @TheRightMelissa All these excuses! He sleeps in his basement days on end, has to take speed to deliver a speech from a teleprompter, uses an earpiece,  and reads interview answers off a computer screen. Yet, his dwindling fan base only offers excuses.
1311022690619273216 2020-09-30 03:19:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @PhakeGamer @MccauleyPenny Haha. I'll be watching for that tonight. 😁
1311020987526385664 2020-09-30 03:12:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MissouriTrucker I'd laugh 😀
1310995504155721728 2020-09-30 01:30:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> If Biden won't comply with the rules about earpieces, the Trump team can scan the area for RF signals and block the one he's using. Or, better yet, emit a loud noise on his frequency.
1310992015837007872 2020-09-30 01:17:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @LUBOttom @Jim_Jordan Bullshit
1310974414914191362 2020-09-30 00:07:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden needs to submit to a brain scan to see if any electronics were inserted during his two brain operations.
1310972841047851010 2020-09-30 00:00:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @obtusegoose @GoAngelo @BretBaier By what logic?
1310972675175653376 2020-09-30 00:00:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @GoAngelo @BretBaier Trump has offered to be drug tested and inspected for earpieces, so why won't Biden do it? Biden is obviously hiding something.
1310960821024022529 2020-09-29 23:13:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps I like Pence, but Ivanka would be a good choice. I have no idea why she or Jared want to be anywhere near government, but we are lucky to have them. They have done excellent work on world peace and US job development.
1310959241767923713 2020-09-29 23:06:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The big irony is those who complain loudest about government being unfair most  often want to make it bigger.
1310937091002507266 2020-09-29 21:38:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @LUBOttom @Jim_Jordan Gee, the article says some of the people who bought his condos were Russian. So? What's your point?

1310850654014001152 2020-09-29 15:55:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Corporations do not pay their taxes, their customers pay them. All their costs, including taxes, are passed along to their customers in the prices they pay. Otherwise, the corporation would lay off all its employees, go bankrupt and cease to exist.
1310849227044671488 2020-09-29 15:49:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden No corporations ever pay their taxes. They can't. Their customers pay their taxes in the price of the corporation's products. If you tax corporations more, the corporation has less money to pay employees and buy supplies, or prices go up.
1310832010861182976 2020-09-29 14:41:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> This is actually better than most BlackPink. Yes, they have a cookie cutter approach to their music, but they are fantastic, tasty cookies. It's a cool sound and who is more glamorous than BlackPink?   https://t.co/gtMvDDdltO

1310695711235813376 2020-09-29 05:39:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps It looks like Dems oversampled, Independents slighted, according to Gallup.  https://t.co/zPNRjV0wqR

1310677912295743488 2020-09-29 04:29:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @marklevinshow Biden and Harris should pay all the salary they collected back to taxpayers. They never did a damned think for it and in many cases hurt our country.
1310668899558608899 2020-09-29 03:53:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN No it hasn't. The article is 99% bullshit.
1310668605424574464 2020-09-29 03:52:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN @CillizzaCNN This is totally false.
1310668205199892480 2020-09-29 03:50:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Tax evasion has not been proven. This is an accusation, not a fact.

The IRS does not get to collect the tax twice. Costs to business are deductible.  You need to study business and taxes so you don't get duped by fake news.

1310539295535632387 2020-09-28 19:18:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @michaelinpooler @Morning_Joe Out on a limb? FACT: A $48 million, 2 1/2 year investigation found no conspiracy between Trump and Russia.
1310531490422370306 2020-09-28 18:47:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Trump needs to hit Biden hard on his desire to reinstate the Iran nuke deal where Iran did not stop processing uranium, hammer Biden on China &amp; his sleazy son's sweetheart deal with CCP members, and on Biden extorting the Ukrainians. Trump can emphasize his midEast peace deals.
1310525653226323968 2020-09-28 18:23:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> ACA is terrible legislation. Those whose employer pays it or on medicaid may not know. As a contractor my premiums and deductibles tripled. Your employer and people who need it know it sucks. Needs to be repealed and replaced.

1310517657066778628 2020-09-28 17:52:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC The only threat of authoritarianism is the Democrat Party.
1310517152148000769 2020-09-28 17:50:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @PhillyGuy_94 @kariek @MSNBC True, but you can't stop the Supreme Court appointment. How stupid was the last scam impeachment, anyway? Democrats are lost with no reason to exist as a party anymore.
1310516525460262912 2020-09-28 17:47:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @kariek @MSNBC No.
1310516112807923713 2020-09-28 17:46:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Trump never said he's not going to accept the will of the people.
1310515349465563136 2020-09-28 17:43:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN Reducing taxes through tax planning is not illegal. You can't get a picture of the sitiation by cherry picking years or data points, as the NY Times is doing.
1310499770771943426 2020-09-28 16:41:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @hapa_girl33 You know Sleepy Joe is really losing it when he starts plagiarizing a third-rate TV actress like Milano.
1310499449194586112 2020-09-28 16:39:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> It's pretty pathetic when the well-known plagiarist Sleepy Joe Biden stoops to plagiarizing a little known third-rate TV actress like Alyssa Milano.
1310489428234825729 2020-09-28 16:00:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I think this is good news. Some things you just don't want to buy online.
1310486923828494337 2020-09-28 15:50:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Buying votes does not work well in private voting booths. That's why Democrats love those mail-in ballots. They can see how they vote before giving them the cigarettes.   https://t.co/Jpa4dLiLUy
1310486133994852353 2020-09-28 15:46:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> This is why Democrats want mail-in ballots. Their big problem with buying votes is they don't know how they voted unless they can see the ballot.  That does not work in a voting booth, but does with mail-in ballots. Democrats have been caught giving away cigarettes to buy votes.
1310484138487619586 2020-09-28 15:39:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Angry_Okinawan @astradyne2112 I got a couple of those. Also, they thought I was a bot twice.   I had to answer questions and give them my number. They've also restricted my activities for a time. It's just harassment of conservatives. I changed my profile. Maybe that will help. It now says I'm loveable.
1310447035783544832 2020-09-28 13:11:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @astradyne2112 That's OK. The ♥bangs♥ are back!

He has a program that calculates it. He's my age. We played around with it and laughed and laughed, like, "Hey, what if we started smoking three packs a day? Punch that in."
1310429256095334402 2020-09-28 12:00:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ScottAdamsSays My favorite Trump line was when he said that he watched CNN the night before and it started to make him hate himself. That is classic stand-up comedy, and his buildup and timing was excellent.
1310424793204895744 2020-09-28 11:43:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Kathwhiteryn Same thing happened to me long ago. It makes you feel great when someone returns your wallet. They had to mail it to me, and I said please keep the money. They did not and I had quite a bit in it because I was on a trip. Left it in a phone booth. Remember those?
1310414128050327552 2020-09-28 11:00:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Some doctors say they think Biden is taking amphetamines. I think he could be getting cocaine from Hunter.

1310011485108744195 2020-09-27 08:20:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @DamonLinker Good!

1310009569070981123 2020-09-27 08:13:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @LaddyNYR @blossomingabyss @JoeBiden He has only been out of his basement 7 of last 14 days. He did not even make a teleprompter speech on TV. He is napping, physically unable to be President. Trump did 5 events yesterday.
1310008050183479296 2020-09-27 08:07:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden Obamacare raised deductibles so high nobody can use it. It's worthless and needs to be replaced. Trump's plan brings down costs.
1310006028067639302 2020-09-27 07:59:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden Liar! We already elected this Senate and President to seat Amy. You don't get to decide.
1309885786502897665 2020-09-27 00:01:22 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Astro_Zombi @PetiteNicoco Mental illness.
1309885040030101506 2020-09-26 23:58:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden has hid in his basement making no public appearances, not even a pre-recorded edited basement interview in front of his teleprompter, 7 of the last 14 days. He's not well. May drop out soon.
1309881885141676037 2020-09-26 23:45:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Unfortunately, Fake News won't tell the Democrats. They are in the dark about the corruption in our FBI under Obama.
1309881131437895680 2020-09-26 23:42:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeConchaTV Compared to Trump, Biden is working at a 1% clip.
1309876928673918979 2020-09-26 23:26:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Dumb idea. We've been giving the unemployed an extra $600 a week since March. What did they do with it? Riot, loot, burn, vandalize. Yang imagined they would create new businesses, improve job skills with UBI. Have you seen much of that?
1309875672207306753 2020-09-26 23:21:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Read all the comments. Apparently, Sleepy lies about his bio all the time.
1309872124652212225 2020-09-26 23:07:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Noideatoosmall Liar! He says he's against detaining anyone or deporting them for crossing our borders illegally. That is open borders!

1309843569683857410 2020-09-26 21:13:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC False. The American people already elected this Senate and this President to make the decision. Scam polls don't count. You lost the Presidential  in 2016 and lost more Senate seats in 2018.
1309837743539785731 2020-09-26 20:50:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @maziehirono Quit being a tyrant, Mazie. The American people weighed in when we elected this Senate and this President. We elected them knowing full well one of their roles is to seat new judges. There is nothing you can do to stop the American people from seating Amy on the Supreme Court.

She said it's an order, not a law, and only a warning is warranted. A warning is only recommended when distancing is not possible. You freaked out, called her names for informing you, and made a fool of yourself.

I don't see them taking courses, learning new skills or starting businesses as he imagined would happen with UBI. Nope. They just cause trouble.

1309576062712647682 2020-09-26 03:30:38 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Terrible. They want to destroy our history, our culture. They even defaced our WWII memorial in Washington, DC. These rioters are scum. This is not how to protest. It is disgusting, despicable behavior is all it is, and criminal. I hope they serve serious prison time.

1309561623187775488 2020-09-26 02:33:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> It looks like Trump was right about everything.
1309555676096716800 2020-09-26 02:09:38 +0800 <CarlWorsham> And who paid for all this skullduggery? Hillary Clinton! She's the one who paid for the fake Steele dossier sourced by a Russian spy!
1309554724212006912 2020-09-26 02:05:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps @thehill Looks like Hillary was colluding with Russians, like Hunter Biden!
1309554297487659008 2020-09-26 02:04:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I know of another collusion with Russia. Hillary Clinton's fake Steele dossier was sourced by a Russian spy!
1309553823409729537 2020-09-26 02:02:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Who is going to repay Flynn for the money and time he lost fighting this battle against the deep state?  I think the Democrat Party should pay! They railroaded a great military man, treated him like trash, then pretend they care about our military.

1309515101612003329 2020-09-25 23:28:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC @maddow Rachel comes up with the dumbest shit to say. Has she seen the Trump rallies? Supporters chanting "We love you." That's something you will never hear at a Biden "rally." In fact, that tedious bore of a scold stopped campaigning. And you really believe your fake polls?
1309495341000032256 2020-09-25 22:09:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Can you imagine a crowd ever chanting "We love you" at a Biden rally or a Kamala Harris rally? That's never going to happen. They are mean, nasty scolds because they are jealous of our President. They hate America because we will never love socialists.    https://t.co/XCqFw263YU

1309450344179564545 2020-09-25 19:11:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Man, this guy needs help. Can you believe people still believe the Russia hoax? They never read the Mueller report that clearly states Trump did not conspire with Russia?
1309449432413413376 2020-09-25 19:07:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @AriFleischer Why are Democrats acting like they are not aware of this?
1309449073334849537 2020-09-25 19:06:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Someone tell the Democrats.
1309447348268027904 2020-09-25 18:59:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Something is wrong with Biden's teleprompter. I can't understand a damned thing it says, can you?  They need to call IT.
1309445146845548544 2020-09-25 18:50:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @samstein Trump is doing debate prep, too. And campaigning, and doing tough interviews, winning Nobel peace prize nominations, rebuilding the economy, creating vaccines... maybe Biden is incapable of being president. It's too much for him.
1309443873769500674 2020-09-25 18:45:22 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CarycruzBueno Hey Cary, read the second box. You have nothing to worry about. Trump is not a white nationalist. You can read, can't you? Read it aloud until it sinks in and you realize people have lied to you. Don't be a chump.  https://t.co/vpHINxx87h
1309442243187671041 2020-09-25 18:38:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HillaryClinton Why would he commit to something that will not happen? He will win.

1309176068587376642 2020-09-25 01:01:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @samstein Trump can campaign and do debate prep while running the country. Biden cannot. Biden is not physically or mentally fit to be President. That is very clear.

1309154264133103620 2020-09-24 23:34:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC @morningmika Mika and everyone at MSNBC are too stupid to understand there will be no transfer of power if Trump wins. Of course you have to "see what happens" before committing to a transfer of power.
1309152976414572550 2020-09-24 23:29:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC That tells you what kind of people Democrats are.
1309152512725876736 2020-09-24 23:27:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Autocrats are the type who spend all their time trying to reverse an election. Give up, Schiff, you lost.

1309079287597805569 2020-09-24 18:36:38 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I thought the rioting would stop when school started. Don't these brats have homework? In my neighborhood, they go to school. Some were playing soccer into the night, leading healthy productive lives. These young Texans will run circles around the rioters their entire lives.
1309075250534064134 2020-09-24 18:20:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RealJamesWoods Haven't we finally realized 20-30% of workers do not need to live near the work site? I can do software development in NYC from my Texas suburban home. It has been practical for 25 years. Now it's been experienced. Large urban cities like NYC no longer make much sense.
1309069983251599360 2020-09-24 17:59:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @tallandmean I'm just glad these teenagers are having fun. On some fields they had actual games. It's great to see things getting back to normal.
1309013806761246720 2020-09-24 14:16:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Kids practicing soccer tonight took my advice to run backwards and sideways for exercise, coordination. Haha. They did good, synced up, looked like dancers. I can't do it. I'd probably fall.  I practice disk golf there to use their lights at night to work on form, distance.
1309005303728529409 2020-09-24 13:42:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @bobaagard @KimStrassel @jasoninthehouse Funny you should say Jared and Ivanka were not qualified for their jobs after Jared brokered three major peace deals and  Ivanka's successful job training initiatives. They alone have done more for world peace and our country than Joe Biden in his 47 years in government.

1308884052133457923 2020-09-24 05:40:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Republicans seem to have more empathy for Sleepy Joe than Democrats or his own family. It's so sad to see what they are doing to him in his condition, so cruel. He really needs to be at home getting his rest. Poor Sleepy. Time to retire.
1308882621322203137 2020-09-24 05:35:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> He's going to stroke out, if they ask him tough questions again. Sad to watch. His family doesn't seem to care. Where's Hunter?
1308874880197300225 2020-09-24 05:04:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpeakerPelosi Trump is the most investigated President in history, yet Pelosi and her Democrats still can't find any proof of any of their lies.

1308874114321575936 2020-09-24 05:01:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Imagine writing for Biden's teleprompter. How do you come up with all that gibberish?

1308833521813856264 2020-09-24 02:20:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> As you might expect, Fake News is downplaying the  #MoscowHunter Biden connection to Russian politicians, the Chinese communist army and top CCP officials.
1308812894969176066 2020-09-24 00:58:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @TheRickWilson A $48 million two-year investigation was not enough? You have to be really stupid to think that.

1308809976367001600 2020-09-24 00:46:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SpringSteps Of course they do. They want NY and CA to be able to run roughshod over the rest of the country. That is not what the founders intended. If they don't like it they can move to Venezuela or someplace.
1308736563782836224 2020-09-23 19:54:46 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @atrupar @Acosta Fauci predicted 2.2 million deaths if we did nothing. Trump did something saving all those lives. McEnany is 100% correct.

1308734059149955073 2020-09-23 19:44:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @donie @Acosta @ddale8 Is this like when CNN clipped out the part where Trump said he "condemned totally" all neo-Nazis and white nationalists, then lied about it for years?
1308729382857519106 2020-09-23 19:26:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Glowjm2 @MSNBC @NBCNews Yes. Democrats always worry they might be tricked into voting Republican 😀

1308704366010994688 2020-09-23 17:46:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Glowjm2 @MSNBC @NBCNews Exactly. The very idea Americans can't sort through the  propaganda to make good decisions I find offensive. After all, if we can see past MSNBC's lies and propaganda, surely Putin's BS is easily ignored. 😀 Did you see those Russian FB ads? Laughable!

1308694175580332032 2020-09-23 17:06:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Alyssa_Milano Criminal Democrats want to defund police because they want to continue breaking the law without getting caught. They aren't fooling anyone.
1308690040114089989 2020-09-23 16:49:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC @NBCNews The Russians (or Soviets) have been publishing US election propaganda since the 1930's that I know about. But, unlike MSNBC reporters, I read history. This is nothing new. It's been going on for at least 87 years.
1308688343681716228 2020-09-23 16:43:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SenFeinstein The difference is you did not have control of the Senate. The people did not want Obama appointing a justice not approved by a GOP Senate, or they would have elected a Democrat Senate. They know the constitution better than you or your low-information followers.
1308659772397416448 2020-09-23 14:49:38 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC Democrats don't have any supporters to knock. Biden won't come out of his basement to campaign much, and when he does four people show up. The polls are BS. No one is going to vote for a CCP puppet whose brain is shot.
1308658676614520832 2020-09-23 14:45:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC Never mind most of Trump's speech was criticizing Biden, a white male, but criticize one person of color and Scarborough says it's racist. Do you know who the real racist is? Scarborough. He thinks people of color can't handle fair political criticism like anyone else.
1308656941707689986 2020-09-23 14:38:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC Scarborough for months falsely claimed those burning, looting and destroying businesses and people's jobs were "peaceful," but when someone says we won't have that at an actual peaceful political rally, he suddenly calls them fascists.
1308563670939688962 2020-09-23 08:27:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle2024 About half of Trump supporters are full of shit, but 100% of Democrats are. It's a lonely world at times 😀
1308543566852042754 2020-09-23 07:07:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump That's right! Maybe you should think about cutting the size and scope of government so blue states don't have to worry about us taking more money. We'll take all your money, if you don't. Thanks, chump!
1308542941187768320 2020-09-23 07:05:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Then quit chanting "defund the police." That's all we've heard for 4 months is how Democrats want to cut police funding and some Democrat cities have!

1308232723287470082 2020-09-22 10:32:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Democrats are trying to wield power the people in the various states never gave them. It's not only silly, but it reeks of a tyrannical mindset. We can't allow them to have any power because we know they will abuse it.

1308222472853037057 2020-09-22 09:51:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta Why is this "speedy" when it's happened many times before this fast. Watch your adjectives. One might think you are a partisan political hack and not a real reporter.
1308221625641431040 2020-09-22 09:48:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @BelowTheRidge @DrKarlynB It's also called honoring the votes of the people in their states.
1308221199995023366 2020-09-22 09:46:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @DrKarlynB No, Karlyn. McConnell had the votes. There was no reason to go through the formalities. Why? What purpose would it serve? The Democrat's purpose? Why? The people selected Republican Senators!  They did not want Democrats to decide anything about Garland. Respect that!
1308220175779614722 2020-09-22 09:42:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @DrKarlynB Karlyn, the people spoke when they elected this President and these Senators. You either support the people, respect their votes, or you are a tyrant without regard to law. The voters did not block Obama with a GOP Senate for nothing.

Even things as simple as picking a judge or casting a ballot can become a crisis in their hands. Blumenthal is trying to turn a mundane, routine judge selection into a civil war.

1307693221192052737 2020-09-20 22:48:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> What does this have to do with George Floyd? Didn't his family say to stop the rioting 4 months ago?
1307681057802772480 2020-09-20 22:00:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RobertHarner10 @be_machiavelli @ScottAdamsSays The Nazis were a socialist alternative to German supporters of Stalin's communism. They were not anything like the GOP. They were more like Bernie. They nationalized healthcare and businesses like Junkers, etc. Their name is National Socialist Party in English.

All the video clearly show him standing in the line of fire between the police and the rioters instead of behind the police where the reporters belong. How stupid can you get?
1307621222373560321 2020-09-20 18:02:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CHIZMAGA Are Democrats ever prepared for  anything?
1307605250237444097 2020-09-20 16:59:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @thehill Ginsburg didn't care about you or any Democrat.
1307604797181263878 2020-09-20 16:57:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Ginsburg did not care what AOC or any other Democrats thought, or she could have retired when Obama was President. I think she would have been 79 when Obama still had a Democrat Senate? Old enough to retire, for sure!
1307602674947436545 2020-09-20 16:49:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Good point. The Senate needs to seat our new conservative justice quickly. Make this happen, Ted, without a long debate!

1307568060761608193 2020-09-20 14:31:33 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The Biden campaign wants you to forget Biden sold out Ukraine to Russia when he was "Obama's point-man on Ukraine."   https://t.co/0IVMT3R37S

Tell me where it says violent protests are allowed. Please note the words "peaceably" in the amendment. He was in a crowd of violent protesters.

1307513912691167232 2020-09-20 10:56:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I don't get any of this. If anyone caught him tearing up a car like that in my neighborhood, he would be stopped by me and my neighbors. It would not be pretty, and the police would come to arrest him. Why are these places different? Why are they just standing there?
1307505261112889344 2020-09-20 10:22:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle2024 The best two on Netflix I don't know  you've seen are Maesang, a very popular office drama with a Hell Josean theme, and My Mister, starring a very determined IU playing a sneaky office worker seeking justice.

It's insane Democrats constantly gripe about the federal government, but want to make it bigger, give it more power. Government works best the closer to home, down to the individual governing himself.
1307494792323043336 2020-09-20 09:40:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @davidgura @AliVelshi Velshi is not a journalist. He a propagandist who supports violence.

1307492795482017793 2020-09-20 09:32:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CulliverThomas @justmystyle2024 @davidgura @AliVelshi I've been around a long time, but have never been near a place where tear gas was a threat. It's easy to avoid if you are not a rioting dumbass burning, looting, destroying property and hurting others. Quit harming others and you can protest without trouble.

1307461005719592964 2020-09-20 07:26:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Anarchist! Needs to be kicked out of the Senate. We cannot tolerate these hateful threats.

1307454220581433344 2020-09-20 06:59:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Democrats will turn America into a communist wasteland like Portland or Venezuela. We have to stop them!

1307101869001650177 2020-09-19 07:39:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar @je_mclaughlin @imillhiser I read a lot of Chinese history. Allowing cities to run roughshod over the country leads to war. Interestingly, the cities eventually lose almost every time. Happened elsewhere a lot, too. Who has most access to resources? Mao understood that. Our Republic protects against that.
1307098089761771521 2020-09-19 07:24:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle2024 @RNelson1994 @JoyVBehar @kimKBaltimore @TheView Joy lied. Trump never once said to not wear a mask. He reflected exactly what the science says. At first, scientists questioned whether it helped, but Trump did not say not to. Then it became more evident it helps and he actually recommended it, wore one when it made sense.
1307095852314513413 2020-09-19 07:15:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle2024 I'm sure you have more reasons than that. 😀
1306984555153416198 2020-09-18 23:52:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @KamalaHarris Democrats are scared to death they are losing black voters. They never think about black voters until election time. Trump cares about them every single day and will not forget them.  https://t.co/ZB5VZ6rjiP

1306891401079160832 2020-09-18 17:42:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle2024 OK.
1306877388341612544 2020-09-18 16:47:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> A lot of the rioters Kamala's fund bailed out were career criminals. Biden's staff also contributed to those bail funds. Then they pretend to be for law and order. Liars. Bail is for people accused of crimes.

1306855140574584832 2020-09-18 15:18:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle2024 I finished School 2013. I could not sit through Biden's forest town hall. Gave me a headache trying to piece his sentences together in my mind trying to figure out what he is saying. School 2013 was far more relaxing. Thanks!

1306830955764748288 2020-09-18 13:42:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Like I said, Biden's speech is like a random pile of incoherent, disjointed sentence fragments you can't piece together in your mind without getting a splitting headache.
1306812715781025796 2020-09-18 12:30:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden You should probably get your own life back on track instead of screaming and ranting incoherently in the forest like a lunatic. You sound like an old scold who can't organize his thoughts.
1306804027104137216 2020-09-18 11:55:33 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @WitchNectar Man, that would be quite an experience flying through the air like that.
1306799927876636674 2020-09-18 11:39:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Redistrict @JoeNBC He speaks in incoherent sentence fragments sounding like an insane, babbling street bum high on drugs. He should be drug tested, and release his CT scans so voters can see what's wrong in there.
1306799170683105282 2020-09-18 11:36:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC Biden hasn't lived in Scranton since he was 10, knows nothing about it. He's spent a half century in DC, accomplishing nothing.
1306778483813683200 2020-09-18 10:14:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @bennyjohnson It's an incoherent mess of sentence fragments meaning nothing, like the insane babbling of drunk street bums.
1306777651974213632 2020-09-18 10:10:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Are Democrats going to pretend they can understand this incoherent pile of meaningless drivel?

1306774374633136128 2020-09-18 09:57:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> This is funny. Has Biden ever had an idea of his own? Lately, he's been lying, copying Trump, proposing doing things Trump did months ago. In reality, Kamala and AOC would be calling the shots, moving us towards Marxism, if he's elected. Can't let that happen.

1306752335931224064 2020-09-18 08:30:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden He did nothing? He restricted travel, shut down the economy for 6 weeks, made sure we had facilities and supplies to keep hospitals from being swamped, fast-tracked therapies and vaccines. You lying whore!
1306749726566633472 2020-09-18 08:19:47 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @palazzo214 @Acosta CK14 is an Acosta bootlicker, the lowest form of life.
1306749157928062976 2020-09-18 08:17:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta Jim, you ankle-biting ass, why don't you write about the middle east peace deals, Trump's nominations for the Nobel Prize, and the Democrat's refusal to condemn the rioters by name? This is just a distraction away from your inept reporting.
1306725499008421889 2020-09-18 06:43:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ACTBrigitte @MsTrump163USA Maybe, but we know Kamala Harris did and the Biden campaign staff did.
1306723115653894146 2020-09-18 06:34:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden isn't shy about raising taxes. The most insidious are the planned Democrat carbon taxes that will increase utility and gasoline prices hurting the poor the most.
1306721055936053249 2020-09-18 06:25:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden Lies. Right now Democrats want a carbon tax that will raise utility and gasoline prices. It hits the poor the most.

1306412824474931200 2020-09-17 10:01:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta Does Redfield think we should do away with the smallpox vaccine and just wear masks? He should be called out for such asinine remarks. Our President is just the person to do it. Redfield should resign or be fired. His comment was pointless, just idiotic nonsense.
1306411093267542016 2020-09-17 09:54:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Acosta comes right out in support of gangs of arsonists burning down churches, destroying statues, attacking Senators and defacing our WWII memorial. That is what Trump wanted to stop in DC with a non-lethal heat ray. A water cannon might work, too, but something is needed.
1306410237432336384 2020-09-17 09:50:47 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta A water canon might be good, too. We need something to keep gangs of arsonists from burning down churches, destroying statues, attacking Senators and defacing our WWII memorial.

1305600861301866496 2020-09-15 04:14:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Herchel understands. Show us your brain scans, Joe!
1305599978451144705 2020-09-15 04:11:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @janine_ashworth @Terileeh2 @CNN @StCollinson Wrong. 750. Down from 2200 and declining. Scientists predicted 2.2 million deaths. Trump has that down to 200,000.
1305594623977558016 2020-09-15 03:49:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ZubyMusic I've found that to be true personally. Get some sunshine, too. Simply going outside regularly for a 30-45 minute walk works wonders. Cut the grains, potatoes and sugars that cause soreness and weight gain. Eat your vegetables like mom said.
1305592226928619521 2020-09-15 03:40:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Why is Biden still refusing to show his brain scans? Voters really need to know what's wrong in there. Why the secrecy? Come out of your basement! Show us the CT scans, Joe!
1305585190492921856 2020-09-15 03:12:20 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN The biggest crisis is the Socialist Democrat Party trying to steal the election with fake ballots, ballot harvesting, violent riots and lies!
1305584729614438402 2020-09-15 03:10:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNNnewsroom @CNN Why is Biden hiding in a field while refusing to go on Joe Rogan with Trump for a four-hour debate? Americans deserve more than Biden ducking and slinging mud in his basement, the chickenshit.
1305583621554802689 2020-09-15 03:06:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Why won't Biden go on Joe Rogan with Trump? When Hidin' Biden is not hiding in his basement, he's hiding in a maize field.

1305409213649350658 2020-09-14 15:33:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN @StCollinson When is CNN going to report the major Middle East peace deals the Trump administration completed or the two nominations Trump received for the Nobel Peace prize?
1305377629319684096 2020-09-14 13:27:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @IgnatiusPost @JoeNBC Scarborough is still not reporting Trump's nominations for the Nobel Peace prize.

1305357960663752709 2020-09-14 12:09:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Then why are Democrats blocking a bill?
1305357310764691456 2020-09-14 12:06:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @raquelreynolds @SenSchumer There are 2 places with walk-in testing on demand within 1 1/2 miles of me in Texas I know about, and I just saw a sign nearby for another. No telling where it is. Tests are everywhere. Obama left us nothing.
1305356093061828609 2020-09-14 12:01:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SenSchumer Little Chuckie Schumer is blocking the checks to help the economy. He's trying to destroy the country to get a CCP puppet elected whose brain is shot. Call off your Marxist antifa punks, Chuckie!
1305354338269827072 2020-09-14 11:55:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @tinyboo49 @SenSchumer If Biden was President, hundreds of thousands more would be dead. He did not even want to restrict COVID-19 super-spreaders from flying in from China.
1305353728262909952 2020-09-14 11:52:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SenSchumer Yet daily deaths have dropped 67% since the peak and are going down fast. 2.2 million deaths were predicted by scientists, but it's less than 1/10th that with a vaccine coming soon, in record time. Tests are overrated. You'll know if you are sick.
1305341506430087168 2020-09-14 11:04:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I figured out why I never heard of Alyssa Milano. She's supposed to be an old TV actress, but has never even been nominated for an Emmy. Trump has two Emmy nominations. She's jealous is why she's always nipping at him.
1305336812886466561 2020-09-14 10:45:22 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN Why do we have to see this ankle-biting crap, but CNN never mentions the Middle East peace deals? Has any President ever been nominated for two Nobel Peace Prizes before, yet the "news" won't report it?
1305336278448250880 2020-09-14 10:43:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN It was more like FDR who said "All we have to fear is fear itself" during the great depression. Trump did not want panic, but he took it very seriously. 2.2 million deaths were predicted. Here we are with less than 1/10th that. Success.

1305263322602917890 2020-09-14 05:53:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Everyone scrutinizes Trump's medical reports and carps about his only medication, an innocuous cholesterol drug over half of Americans take over age 55. Yet, no one in the press asks what drugs Biden is on? C'mon, man... rumor is he takes Alzheimer's meds! Shouldn't we know?
1305259775496683523 2020-09-14 05:39:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Good news... the Dick's sporting goods near me closed their doors. The boycott worked here. They can either sell AR-15's or go to hell.
1305257282809335808 2020-09-14 05:29:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The entire city rec center is closed. I want my city taxes back!
1305255998253412352 2020-09-14 05:24:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I found out the outdoor city pool is still closed. Makes no sense. They could at least let a few in at a time! We should be able to reserve lap time. Of course, the indoor pool is shut down, but outdoor? Nonsense! I'm calling the city!

1304954322590068739 2020-09-13 09:25:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ScottAdamsSays If "they" pulled back, with no leaders, who would express that position? Some BLM stalwart may have pulled back, but we would never know. It's confusing, a reason to follow the money, ferret out their leaders so we can deal.
1304939539778199552 2020-09-13 08:26:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Of course. Biden is a CCP puppet.
1304936994066358273 2020-09-13 08:16:38 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @badService0 The outbreak was controlled. Prediction was 2.2 million deaths, it's 200,000 now. Hospitals were not overburdened, killing more. Everyone had supplies, food. A huge success and economy is bouncing back strong.

1304918009920671744 2020-09-13 07:01:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ErrolWebber It's quite a contrast to Trump's extemporaneous  wit, quick answers and thoughtful, transparent responses to reporters.
1304915307962736640 2020-09-13 06:50:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @badService0 The President has to look at issues from every perspective. Knowing when to shut down without destroying the economy is one, national defense another. He played it perfectly.

1304809622948261888 2020-09-12 23:50:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @badService0 There were no known cases in the US then. Too soon to shut down the economy. Trump threaded the needle exactly right, protecting American lives &amp; not destroying the economy. Hospitals stayed open, we had food, no one went without medical supplies.
1304808286416404486 2020-09-12 23:45:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JakeResist @RudyGiuliani Read the article. It is very fair in its analysis. Obama ranked last in growth since WWII. Economies actually grow faster after a recession! Unless your name is Obama!  Learn some damned economics.
1304807741475651588 2020-09-12 23:43:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JakeResist @RudyGiuliani Just read the damned article and quit trying to make shit up, cherry pick data and lie.  Do you even know what an annualized growth rate is? It's the rate from the beginning to end of their terms. It's a fair comparison and Obama was the worst, eight years of crap growth.
1304803971622678528 2020-09-12 23:28:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @badService0 They did not have a feel for how fast it spread here, yet. There was not one known death in the US until the last day of February.  Two weeks later they called for the shut down. Even then, there had been very few deaths.

I could not finish Legends of the Blue Sea, more suited for children. I watched it for Jun Ji-Hyun and Lee Min Ho, two of my favorite stars, Ji-hyun being the Sassy Girl and she was in My Love from the Star.

1304708423800492032 2020-09-12 17:08:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Another useless flake trying to capitalize on Trump's presidency by making up stories to titilate MSNBC's brainless fan base.
1304707633614651395 2020-09-12 17:05:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CapnBradnPearl Yeah, I had friends who worked on their election software. They had reporters following them around everywhere. Little did the reporters know they were only interested in making the software work and had no interest in their local politics. It was funny.

1304703383576678400 2020-09-12 16:48:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Riverking73 @megynkelly Like President and General Dwight Eisenhower who said "“In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex." Do you want a  President who cowers before his generals?

1304693773276979201 2020-09-12 16:10:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @NYY_Mae @megynkelly Because Biden wants to be President. Are you in favor of not asking what he'd do as President? That seems rather pathetic to me.
1304692448682225665 2020-09-12 16:04:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @megynkelly Dimwit Ducklo forgets that those who came in during the flight restrictions were American citizens. A good follow-up would be to ask if Biden was in favor of trapping Americans in Covid-infested countries or bringing them home to quarantine like Trump did.

I understand some need to be careful, have no qualms about wearing my mask to the store, but some of these governors are so overboard their scheme of destruction is obvious, and they are causing more harm than good.

1304684838184718336 2020-09-12 15:34:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Great leaders know panic is not a solution to anything. Criticizing Trump for wanting the country to stay calm while we solved this problem is one of the dumbest takes on the internet today.

1304683375358291970 2020-09-12 15:28:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> COVID-19 was a serious threat. Trump kept people from freaking out, kept PPE prices from soaring. At the same time, he acquired PPE, ventilators, flattened the curve with the 6-week shutdown, kept hospitals from being overwhelmed saving lives, and accelerated vaccine research.

1304681390424948737 2020-09-12 15:20:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CNN In CNN's ongoing effort to shut the economy down to slow the Trump Recovery, they instill fear in diners to make sure more and more people are out of work. What they don't think about are the deaths caused from so many not having jobs. They don't care about that, do they?

India admitted many are dying at home without ever seeing a doctor. These aren't chants, dipshit, they are facts. You remain unable to explain why deaths are only 10% of what was predicted.

Quit regurgitating the lies you see on MSNBC. The fact remains 2.2 million deaths were predicted and we only have a tenth that thanks to Trump's quick action.

Daily death counts are down 67% from peaks, and dropping fast. Those who screamed to follow the science, suddenly are changing their tune. Trump followed the science!

1304652581705314324 2020-09-12 13:26:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Most ignorant take on the internet. Anyone who blames Trump for a virus that spread from China to every corner of the planet has to have his head examined. The scientists predicted 2.2 million deaths in the US. Trump's actions got that down to this small number.

1304028229641043969 2020-09-10 20:05:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Biden wanted to allow thousands of COVID-19 super spreaders to fly in from China, calling Trump "xenophobic" for restricting flights. Trump saved millions of lives. You aren't fooling anyone who has a brain.
1304025569038872577 2020-09-10 19:54:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @TheGamb10 @laserblast92 @stillgray Hammer away. You will lose big time. You aren't very bright.
1304025316059422722 2020-09-10 19:53:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @TheGamb10 @NILST_ @stillgray Why do they clearly not count?
1304025072269758465 2020-09-10 19:52:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @TheGamb10 @stillgray His administration brokered peace deals with Serbia, Kosovo, Israel, UAE recently. He reduced US troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. No wars started under his command. He was just nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.
1304021901078036480 2020-09-10 19:40:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @thehill The article says 25 people who were there went on record saying the stories are lies, yet some people still want to believe anonymous sources?
1304017739405815808 2020-09-10 19:23:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Has anyone else noticed that Biden has a lot of trouble with numbers? Numbers seem to disrupt his speech pattern and cause him to become confused, too.
1304013713247268865 2020-09-10 19:07:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ScottAdamsSays The Cheshire Cat is very wise.

1304008006871506945 2020-09-10 18:45:10 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Kamala throws thousands into prison to serve long sentences for petty marijuana crimes, then visits a rapist in the hospital and bails out murderers to commit murder again. She has no idea what justice is.   https://t.co/uvl8jij7po

1303859446288977923 2020-09-10 08:54:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC Probably from watching your terribly depressing and hateful show.
1303856219870900224 2020-09-10 08:42:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Biden opposed shutting down air travel from China. That would have killed hundreds of thousands more. Scaring Americans would not have saved any lives.
1303855536987869185 2020-09-10 08:39:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC I guess your CCP handlers won't let you blame China.
1303831124251205633 2020-09-10 07:02:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden is using the old playbook of mouthing Republican policy to get elected, while scheming to move ever closer to socialism. Look at his VP pick--most left-wing voting record in the Senate.
1303829691002949635 2020-09-10 06:56:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SenSchumer We aren't going to let you stack the court with left-wing radicals. Go away.
1303823557064044547 2020-09-10 06:32:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @realDonaldTrump @TeriN41574377 We just need to get out the vote to shut up the ankle-biters. They are more a nuisance at this point, with no plan for future peace and prosperity, just a bungling mess of nimrods yapping away.
1303819295647043585 2020-09-10 06:15:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle2024 @MestizaForTrump @Redfin @zillow Gov. Abbott did a poll and found that most Californians moving to Texas vote Republican. Hopefully, y'all will get the same results. We can just concentrate the few that stay on the Left Coast and take away their representatives in the census.
1303818324472737793 2020-09-10 06:11:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle2024 @tedxlondon @n1kk1m My very liberal Mexican-American sister-in-law thinks Latinx is the dumbest word in the world. That's pretty much universal in Texas, it appears, no matter one's politics.
1303810811962499073 2020-09-10 05:41:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @tedxlondon @n1kk1m Very stupxd.
1303810229201711106 2020-09-10 05:39:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HillaryClinton @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump All the Democrats do is divide people into groups and pit them against each other for political gain. Everyone wants to be friends, but Democrats try to prevent it at every turn.
1303809707233161219 2020-09-10 05:37:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden Do you have any friends who speak with an Indian accent?
1303809128230518787 2020-09-10 05:34:54 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle2024 @KamWah888 But it was not a US production, and in Mandarin. It's not like Asian film awards include US movies. There are a few international awards like the Cannes Festival awards. I still can't get over those kids killing themselves.
1303803884570382342 2020-09-10 05:14:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard And? If a religious school can provide a better education than a public school, that's great for the children. I'm very close to blocking you because you do not make sense. The goal is to give every child a good education so they have a  fair chance in this world. Agree?
1303803140135964673 2020-09-10 05:11:06 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta So far, it's worked out great for Trump. A leader does not want the world to panic, to see prices for PPE rise, and he takes the smart action like Trump did, instead of saying it's "xenophobic" to keep super spreaders from China out of the country like Biden said.
1303789279215222784 2020-09-10 04:16:02 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @GavinNewsom Don't blame your mismanagement on climate. It's stupid.
1303788303876055041 2020-09-10 04:12:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden didn't want Americans to panic, either. He just wanted to fly in thousands of COVID-19 super spreaders from China  because he said it would be "xenophobic" not to. Biden would have killed millions.
1303765926794465292 2020-09-10 02:43:14 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard And below many poorer countries.
1303765727799914497 2020-09-10 02:42:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard The US spends more per pupil than any other country, yet ranks below most OECD countries in student outcomes. Throwing money at public schools expecting different results is the definition of insanity.
1303764933360914436 2020-09-10 02:39:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard It means eliminating underperforming public schools, not all.  If private schools are better, is it a bad thing to have better outcomes for children at the same cost?
1303764348154806276 2020-09-10 02:36:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard School choice applies market forces to improving schools. Parents can take their children out of underperforming schools and put them in better schools.
1303697780918099970 2020-09-09 22:12:27 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard Devoss is great. She's for school choice.
1303643667035496454 2020-09-09 18:37:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @GrumpAdam @MSNBC Biden gave away millions of Pennsylvania jobs to his pals in China. He doesn't care a thing about Pennsylvania.
1303643051559202816 2020-09-09 18:34:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Biden hasn't lived in Pennsylvania for nearly seven decades. He has no clue about Pennsylvania. In fact, his brain is gone and he has no clue of much at all.
1303624167812739072 2020-09-09 17:19:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @LauretteSTucker @mtavkhelidze @M_Yates_Az @JamesTodaroMD Yes, even the experts have said 10X.
1303623651342848000 2020-09-09 17:17:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @M_Yates_Az @JamesTodaroMD A lot of people had it who were never tested. They were just sick a day or two and went back to work.
1303620843474489350 2020-09-09 17:06:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Fabian2L @JamesTodaroMD I agree. Most pharmaceutical companies are creating this vaccine at cost, with no profit. Vaccines generally are not very profitable compared to their other products.
1303616530161307648 2020-09-09 16:49:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @trishandmolly @NewshubPolitics I agree. It's a conflict of interest. They can team up to give themselves raises, walk all over the private sector, destroy the productive parts of the economy.
1303600636030787585 2020-09-09 15:46:26 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard That bailout did not take a big government. Private banks actually did the most work. How about we eliminate a few agencies like the Dept of Education and Dept of Labor, two redundant agencies doing what states already do?
1303599348274597888 2020-09-09 15:41:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @bobbywarnsiii @eican @dbongino Old joke. It was not intended to be taken seriously, and it certainly was not directed at the entire military, just McCain. Trump is not in favor of endless wars.
1303489673818509312 2020-09-09 08:25:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard What I want is smaller government so it does not impact our lives so much.
1303489144363061248 2020-09-09 08:23:24 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard Our representatives would have no clue what is going on without lobbyists. A lobbyist is just someone people hire to take their issues to the representatives. Like BLM. They can form a PAC to send someone to Schumers office to present proposed legislations.
1303476660403085312 2020-09-09 07:33:47 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Do you have any articles about it being illegal to burn, loot and commit acts of vandalism? Or do you just want to make up lies about the 2nd Amendment being illegal?
1303469947796897792 2020-09-09 07:07:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard They can, but so can any group like AARP, NRA, several attorney groups, real estate groups... all need to have a voice. Form your own lobby group.
1303445312372199424 2020-09-09 05:29:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @thehill Cuomo can repeat his lie forever, but it won't bring back the lives of the 11,000 Cuomo killed in nursing homes. China's lies and deceit caused it to spread to every corner of the world, not Trump.
1303442503853658112 2020-09-09 05:18:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard  https://t.co/UbdTQLC5PP
1303440793961738244 2020-09-09 05:11:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard BTW, Trump's DOJ just whittled away at the Patriot Act with some decisions on FISA warrant reform.
1303439798254940160 2020-09-09 05:07:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard There's nothing wrong with super pacs. It's how the people get their voices heard. For example, the NRA supports 2A against the authoritarians.
1303436731958669312 2020-09-09 04:55:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ScottAdamsSays 😀😁😅 It's a single whammy.
1303434904894615557 2020-09-09 04:47:52 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard Either reason is not valid for that kind of destruction. Everyone heard the message about George Floyd, sympathised, believed the peaceful protesters had a strong argument. Police reform was discussed. Changes recommended. The escalating violence reversed the progress.
1303434108031336454 2020-09-09 04:44:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard Trump isn't controlled by anyone. Why we elected him.
1303415983261052930 2020-09-09 03:32:41 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard I hear you. My words were brutal because I strongly disagree with her promoting violence with free bail money. That is very stupid, in my opinion and you apparently agree. But, I'll try to do more explaining, less insulting.
1303415026112487432 2020-09-09 03:28:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard If someone is committing a crime like arson, vandalism or looting stores during or not during a riot, jail is the usual and best solution. It is the solution hammered out over many centuries. If you do not like it, it's up to you, not me, to come up with a viable alternative.
1303399214534266880 2020-09-09 02:26:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard How do you respond to hate and violence? By mincing your words? Kamala has funded rioters with free bail money, many who committed violent crimes.
1303384148434878467 2020-09-09 01:26:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @PetiteNicoco Now I know why women avoid me. I didn't know we men were all like that. That's a relief. I thought I might be using the wrong deoderant.

Some of the rioters they helped bail out went on to commit violent crimes while out on bail and turned up rioting again. That's why these are called the #BidenRiots on Tw¡tter.  https://t.co/h6Z9Crbzjf
1303374541864022016 2020-09-09 00:48:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @mymichaelryan @HumorBurner @MSNBC No. Wrong.

It is not anti-military to say beware of the Military-Industrial Complex.  CNN is groping for another war to get clicks. They don't care about our military, just blood and gore to put on TV to sell ads.
1303369489904545792 2020-09-09 00:27:56 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Chris Hayes has to be the biggest dumbass on TV. No one believes this. How can anyone say something so stupid? Even Morning Joe isn't this stupid. Not even Mike Barnicle... ok, maybe Barnicle. Top two dumbasses on TV, in some order.
1303367880696836099 2020-09-09 00:21:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> You've got Democrats flopping around setting each other on fire and bullying old people, and they want to run the country? Hell, no. Throw all the Democrats out. They are the party of chaos and stupidity. Very dangerous.

1303308291427139585 2020-09-08 20:24:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @realDonaldTrump The #BidenRiots taught us it's not about black lives. These are anarchists, fight clubs, and psuedo-Marxists who are incapable of explaining what they want.

1303302098243682310 2020-09-08 20:00:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @HumorBurner @MSNBC The #BidenRiots have cost $11 billion in property damage so far. I image it's that much more in medical costs, police and fire overtime, etc.

1303282195126251521 2020-09-08 18:41:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @iamcardib Your "music" is nothing more than ugly cuss word set to a mechanical drum beat, with no musicianship. No melody, not one stitch of humanity in it. Why does anyone listen to that garbage?

1303006361727442949 2020-09-08 00:24:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I found out who Cardi B is. Her music is vulgar, shallow, grade A manure for insensitive ears. It's depraved torture of the soul. This is what music sounds like.   https://t.co/4uqIh50Qib

1302997174549204992 2020-09-07 23:48:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard I'm learning digital music production. There are ways to humanize the sound, put emotion into it. Example... no drummer hits the hi hat exactly the same each time. You can vary the volume very slightly each tap. Then it sounds like a live, human drummer. Cardi B can't do that?
1302995798221885442 2020-09-07 23:43:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard Good, it has intellectual some depth. I just listened to Cardi B. First thing, F-word, then N-word followed by P-word. No melody, drums too loud, mechanical, no feeling to instruments. Sad.

1302989367259148288 2020-09-07 23:17:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Marvin_GoHard C'mon, man 😀 There's so much more to hear. Aren't you tired of rap, yet?  https://t.co/iC34De43II
1302987983411392513 2020-09-07 23:11:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @DougDigdug OK. That explains it. Rap was interesting the first few weeks, but it exceeded it's Use By date by a couple of decades. So, I quit listening to it. Hardly watch US movies, either. Most is too vulgar and depraved.
1302985884258754560 2020-09-07 23:03:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @itslemonaid I only listen to KPop and some indie and jazz music these days. It got to where US music was the same old crude garbage. I like having things like an actual melody in my music. Call me persnickety 😀
1302982226053722113 2020-09-07 22:49:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Who is Cardi B? I've never heard of her.

1302675701171183617 2020-09-07 02:31:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden's excuse for saying he will shut down the economy is he would if scientists told him to. What?! That's worse! What do scientists know about the economy? No! You consult all concerned, including economists, and thread the needle perfectly, making great decisions like Trump.

Shave a little off the top 10%. Also, look at pension reform for new hires before becoming California with their pension debt.

China's entire history dating back millennia, for example. The electoral college is more fair, avoids that, divides some power with states.

1302527098297384960 2020-09-06 16:40:34 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @mattgaetz True. Despite that "Emmy" handed out by Hollywood perverts, 2 1/2 Men flopped after Sheen left. Anger Management was so much better when Sheen no longer had to carry Cryer's ass. Cryer pretty much ruined TV for me.

1302312694041714688 2020-09-06 02:28:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Yeah, right, Trump is getting all these peace agreements signed so he can start a war. What kind of sense does that make? Trump is a anti-war President like Reagan--peace through strength--and, it's working.

1302248809184059398 2020-09-05 22:14:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> To these young reporters today, "confirmed" means they found another left-wing nut who agrees with them. It does not mean they have an eye witness or any evidence of any kind.   https://t.co/inepJy8hGP

Dallas caught politicians paying relatives school funds for roofs never fixed, using city budgets to buy personal home furniture, etc. Then, what do they NOT get caught doing?! Tulsa paid for an entire miles long road never built!
1301809993554034688 2020-09-04 17:11:03 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @robertjdenault @TAAP2020 An intense investigation over years led to a Mueller Report revealing no Trump crime. Schiff and congressional Democrats did not use one word of the Mueller Report in impeachment, they thought it was so weak. Trump is not a criminal. No proof of it.
1301809197672136704 2020-09-04 17:07:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @robertjdenault Both are using the same made-up anonymous sources. And, both news agencies lied for four years about Trump being a Russian agent. They have zero credibility.
1301805019474386945 2020-09-04 16:51:17 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC @JoeNBC Scarborough is a liar. Trump said if your mail-in vote is not counted, go to polls and fill out a provisional ballot to be used if your mail-in ballot is never found. Kayleigh explained it again yesterday for morons like Scarborough.
1301800705477480453 2020-09-04 16:34:09 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @NYGovCuomo Liar. You killed 11,000 seniors in nursing homes,  mand are deflecting the blame. Millions of New Yorkers are ashamed they voted for you.  You are the worst governor in the country.

No one will need new planes for awhile. Before covid, they had a 7 year backlog of orders. It might be a good play to buy BA stock while it's this low. It may take a year or two to get back on track, though.

1301785225371037696 2020-09-04 15:32:38 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC Scarborough lies for four years about Trump being a Russian agent, yet thinks people still trust him.

1301778942827941891 2020-09-04 15:07:40 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC The Atlantic did not "cite" anyone who said that. A citation must include a name and other identifying information like an age. Does MSNBC know anything about journalism?
1301777578768961536 2020-09-04 15:02:15 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Democrat polling shows the military will vote against them so they make up a lie using fake anonymous sources.
1301777224924909568 2020-09-04 15:00:50 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC Trump wants us to make sure our vote is counted. He did not advocate voting twice unless the first ballot was not counted.
1301776380649254915 2020-09-04 14:57:29 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC The poor are better off in countries that have the most billionaires and millionaires, suffer where no one can get rich.

1301505214776737792 2020-09-03 20:59:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Insane pitch looks almost like trick photography. It's real, though! Darvish is like a magician this season.
1301502938179948546 2020-09-03 20:50:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @roogu6 It does not make sense because Yu pitched the 29th.
1301501523822866433 2020-09-03 20:45:18 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @roogu6 You are correct. That is what they say. I thought Yu was next.

1301488036476264448 2020-09-03 19:51:43 +0800 <CarlWorsham> As if the sight of Pelosi tearing up Trump's speech was not ugly enough, she has to attack a hairdresser. She's the most gruesome and despicable woman on Earth.
1301487332588126208 2020-09-03 19:48:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump After years of intense investigation no one found a crime Trump committed. Democrats did not even use one word from the Mueller Report for impeachment because no  crime was in it.

1301466263731032064 2020-09-03 18:25:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @realDonaldTrump I would definitely monitor the bluetooth traffic around Biden to see if he's receiving signals.

1301370769121959937 2020-09-03 12:05:44 +0800 <CarlWorsham> What are you hiding, Joe Biden? Release your brain scans! #releasethescans
1301370098859552768 2020-09-03 12:03:04 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump When will you release the CT scans from your two brain surgeries? Voters deserve to know what is missing and what is wrong with you. That is way more important than tax returns no one cares about.
1301351081738473477 2020-09-03 10:47:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @KamalaHarris So you were not fanning violence by giving bail money to rioters?

1301204920805228546 2020-09-03 01:06:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Leave my governor alone. Dan is right. Abbot did ever right, is threading the needle perfectly, keeping businesses open and protecting our health.

1301165781590384641 2020-09-02 22:31:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Rubadubdubman @Bethvanduyne It's a slow, insidious path. Read "Road to Serfdom" by Hayek. Government spends 36% of GDP each year at all levels. Why so? Why should government spending be over a third of our economy? Federal spending is most of that. It's best to keep spending local, close to the people.
1301160179900338176 2020-09-02 22:08:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @laniebme Lies. Blocked.
1301155313756893185 2020-09-02 21:49:35 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC @JoeNBC Blaming Trump for a virus that came from China and infected every corner of the world is probably the dumbest take ever. Biden said it was xenophobic to restrict travel from China. Thank God he was not President and never will be. Trump slowed it's spread, saved lives.
1301153808257552384 2020-09-02 21:43:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SenrabG I noticed that, too. I think Minneapolis is less than that. It's crazy these lily white cities in the north are having all the problems while in Texas we're just trying to be friends with everybody and hardly think about race much. Not outside our living room TV, anyway.
1301146509124268033 2020-09-02 21:14:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @philosurfer88 @EpochTimes True, but they just go back to their core wells, quit investing in exploration, and the price comes back. They can get it down to where they can make money at $40/bbl in US. Unfortunately, it's lower than that now, but it will come back because they are slowing drilling.
1301142318100221952 2020-09-02 20:57:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle2024 @George89548313 @nypost H.O.T. was the first KPop band. It was created from marketing research. KPop has always been all about commercialization. If they hit on something that clicks, they will pursue that formula aggressively for $$. It gets into a rut, then an F(x) will come along to break the mold.

They tackle a lot of different styles, from beautiful ballads, to poppy fun songs to alluring sexy things. Would You, Russian Roulette, Bad Boy and Psycho are all so different stylistically. Blue Lemonade is a B-side that is so cute. I love it.
1301130583343616001 2020-09-02 20:11:19 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @EpochTimes I don't know why it is "controversial." Fracking has been used safely and effectively since the 1940's.  The new tech is combining it with directional drilling to achieve even better results. It's been around for a long time, with no significant environmental issues.
1301129621258350593 2020-09-02 20:07:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ShhhMarisa_B Their plan all along appears to be to remove Biden after the election and insert Kamala. It was no big secret the DNC, Silicon Valley &amp; Hollywood donors and the East Coast press wanted Kamala to win. They chose this avenue after it was clear Kamala could not win in the primary.

This is nothing compared to a drill sergeant getting in her face. She's well-trained and disciplined, unlike her adversary. Makes me proud of our police.
1301112910333259777 2020-09-02 19:01:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle2024 It's the people who elect them.  The fatal flaw in our government is politicians can buy votes with the people's money. It will eventually end in disaster as people sell their souls to a central committee who controls their pocketbook and their lives.

1300911301561135112 2020-09-02 05:39:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @1776Stonewall Very likely he's a Democrat, then.
1300910955023433728 2020-09-02 05:38:36 +0800 <CarlWorsham> It does not matter what Biden decides week to week about  fracking. If Democrats gain power, they will ban fracking, destroy the energy sector, and he will go along with them, just like he went along with banning fracking during the debates.
1300901445538131971 2020-09-02 05:00:48 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @stillgray Of course, he's a Democrat.
1300897490573709313 2020-09-02 04:45:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RyanAFournier I'm not so sure about that. It might be a good idea to move the entire capital, monuments and all, to Kansas, closer to the center of the country.
1300896215102615554 2020-09-02 04:40:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden If Democrats weren't always dividing people by race, sex, sexual orientation and income to pit them against each other for political gain, maybe we could all get along as Americans.
1300846374238466049 2020-09-02 01:21:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @NPR Without evidence? It's on video all over the internet. He was clearly being attacked.
1300843175054016517 2020-09-02 01:09:16 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ScottAdamsSays And this... Axios preparing us for a coup attempt...  https://t.co/E8FThgeh72
1300831379656237056 2020-09-02 00:22:23 +0800 <CarlWorsham> We really need to drive up the popular vote for Trump.
1300829877860532226 2020-09-02 00:16:25 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SenSchumer Trump has been calling for law and order all along. Biden is late to the party along with governors who turned down Trump's offers of National Guard assistance. In fact, Biden staffers and Kamala gave rioters free bail money to keep rioting.
1300828253091962881 2020-09-02 00:09:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle2024 @George89548313 @nypost Learning digital recording is opening my eyes to why US music degraded, especially to rap. It's a great tool, but it lends itself to creating beats and sound effects instead of music.
1300817577019609089 2020-09-01 23:27:33 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump There's a difference between being run down by armed criminals with guns and defending yourself and being a mass shooter, moron. If you do not know the difference you should resign your House seat.
1300809946746019841 2020-09-01 22:57:13 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle2024 @George89548313 @nypost Plus, KPop is improving, becoming more varied, producing the best music videos ever in history. Japan is producing more jazz than the US, and we invented it. And US musicians have become depraved, crude and vulgar.
1300807027569184769 2020-09-01 22:45:37 +0800 <CarlWorsham> I don't like Laura Ingraham that much. She interrupted our President too many times, inserting her own opinions. I'm interested in Trump's opinions. When he's answering a question, let him finish his answer.
1300805298135937025 2020-09-01 22:38:45 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @KamalaHarris It would have been a million dead if we did not restrict flights as Biden wanted. Thanks to Trump's quick action far fewer died, daily deaths have declines 60%.
1300802076122009600 2020-09-01 22:25:57 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Why is the press not telling the stories of the thousands of rioters arrested? It might act as a deterrent. Are CNN and MSNBC encouraging the rioters by hiding the actual news? Does it spoil their faery tale the protests are peaceful?
1300765007962136576 2020-09-01 19:58:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @SWRiverRat2 They are making up everything now.
1300764644424978432 2020-09-01 19:57:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta Who was pretending to be Biden, sending his tweets while he was giving a speech.
1300761999626903555 2020-09-01 19:46:42 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle2024 @seanhannity Travelling man...  https://t.co/vQIyRyDjp7
1300761564602085376 2020-09-01 19:44:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle2024 @seanhannity Except Lebron James who often thinks he's a running back and forgets he has to dribble the ball.
1300760681147502593 2020-09-01 19:41:28 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @justmystyle2024 @catturd2 Democrats are always pretending they love our country. They aren't fooling anyone!
1300719428385099778 2020-09-01 16:57:32 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Biden has never had an original thought in his life. He's a copycat, a phony political hack.
1300718539146485761 2020-09-01 16:54:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Democrats are keeping their states shut down hoping to stall the Trump recovery until election day. Americans see right through it!
1300718483051864064 2020-09-01 16:53:47 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @CarrieKikki Democrats are keeping their states shut down hoping to stall the Trump recovery until election day. Americans see right through it!
1300717495029030912 2020-09-01 16:49:51 +0800 <CarlWorsham> If Democrats think Trump is corrupt, how do they explain he was investigated for years yet nothing in the Mueller Report was used in their scam impeachment? Even congressional Democrats admitted there was no corruption found or they would have used it.
1300706197524357120 2020-09-01 16:04:58 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @trevornsmith @TheRightMelissa @JoeBiden He was retreating.
1300706005219713024 2020-09-01 16:04:12 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden Get back in your basement, Joe. Of course we don't want violence. Quit allowing your thugs to run loose with guns, looting and burning.
1300698880712073216 2020-09-01 15:35:53 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @igorbobic Maybe he said that because he was acting out of self defense.
1300682212900298758 2020-09-01 14:29:39 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Don't be fooled by the Democrat's postal service scam. They know full well the post office cannot handle mail-in voting volume and it's impossible to get them ready for it this late. It's nothing more than a scheme to discredit the election when Trump wins.
1300677288607076352 2020-09-01 14:10:05 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @heycheri Thanks, Cheri. The fact they harassed you for encouraging an open discussion about political literature was revealing. Let us know how your reading is going.
1300675553234649088 2020-09-01 14:03:11 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @MSNBC The postal service is not equipped to handle millions of ballots and can't be, at this late date. Democrats are pushing this nonsense to discredit the election and cause trouble when Trump wins. If we can go to Walmart, we can vote in person.
1300672969618923522 2020-09-01 13:52:55 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @joelockhart @realDonaldTrump No.
1300669751325347840 2020-09-01 13:40:08 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeBiden When violent left-wing protesters chase people down with guns trying to kill them, they can and will shoot back. We all know who started this, and it was not right wing militia. The left has been rioting for months and some are fed up.
1300668459441893376 2020-09-01 13:35:00 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC But for months you said it was peaceful protests, Joe, even as buildings burned, children died.
1300667455128338443 2020-09-01 13:31:01 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Joe Biden still had not personally denounced neo-Nazi Richard Spencer's endorsement of his campaign.
1300666837001101317 2020-09-01 13:28:33 +0800 <CarlWorsham> Now Fake News is trying to blame Biden's speech issues on "technical glitches."
1300660492231475200 2020-09-01 13:03:21 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ScottAdamsSays How do we know Biden is fit for office. He still refuses to release his CT scans. #ReleaseTheScans
1300659681812193280 2020-09-01 13:00:07 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @ProjectLincoln Why won't Biden release his CT scans? #ReleaseTheScans
1300657592620978176 2020-09-01 12:51:49 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @JoeNBC Biden wants to totally shut down the economy again. How safe is that?
1300656509853085697 2020-09-01 12:47:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> The rioters are chanting "Death to America" now. Biden and Kamala said the violence will continue, if Trump wins. Do Democrats really think they can win this way? We will not let them destroy our country with violence, threats and intimidation!
1300654613394227202 2020-09-01 12:39:59 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @PSRSurf @Acosta That was before his brain burnt out.
1300653734805016576 2020-09-01 12:36:30 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @LibbyPander @Acosta True. His controllers rarely even let him out of his basement. Acosta (D-CNN) doesn't get it when it's right there in front of his eyes for everyone to see. As usual with Acosta!
1300635621812310017 2020-09-01 11:24:31 +0800 <CarlWorsham> @Acosta It's probably true. How can Biden  give a speech and send a tweet at the same time? Someone else is sending his tweets, some  invisible person or organization we don't know. Who is controlling him and writing his tweets?
