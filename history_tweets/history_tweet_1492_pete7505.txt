Even as a political system, it presupposes a level of social trust never attainable in a country as diverse as the US.

1321978263510671361 2020-10-30 08:52:33 +0800 <pete7505> @mtaibbi How could a potential president having a crackhead sex-addicted son who's made countless questionable deals with China and Ukraine and Russia, and been accused of inappropriate sexual behavior in the presence of his minor relatives be considered a story?

How could a president having a crackhead sex-addicted son who's made countless questionable deals with China and Ukraine and Russia, and been accused of inappropriate sexual behavior in the presence of his minor relatives be considered potential kompromat?

He may very well be a pathological liar. His family is utterly dysfunctional in a way only the elites can be. Untangle the entire backstory, it could be the best thing since "All the Kings Men."

If it was all BS, the Biden camp could force the hand by offering a detailed denial. If they did so convincingly, they would turn this into a huge defeat for Trump. Crickets.

1316159404941737987 2020-10-14 07:30:29 +0800 <pete7505> @EPoe187 Do you think it is more prevalent on the left or right? I used to think the the conservatives were the worst offenders, but these days I'm not sure. The woke certainly seem full of religious fervor, but in the age of social media and corporate presentation of news, hard to tell.

1316062187555823621 2020-10-14 01:04:11 +0800 <pete7505> @wil_da_beast630 3. I endorse neither position, but the irrationality of a pro-choice or pro-abortion rights vegan might be better understood in light of understanding where people come from. Reasonable people disagree.
1316061660436729857 2020-10-14 01:02:05 +0800 <pete7505> @wil_da_beast630 2. Whereas the utilitarian may have as a moral code "Act in that manner which reduces suffering." Many abortion supporters hold that the seconds of suffering in the killing of the fetus are outweighed by the suffering they, their mother, and society might experience otherwise.
1316060955164508162 2020-10-14 00:59:17 +0800 <pete7505> @wil_da_beast630 1. This is the crux of the contrast between deonotlogical and teleological ethical systems, such as utilitarianism. Rule-based moral systems may have a commandment such as "Don't Kill" with various exceptions such as, "Don't kill unless the person you are killing is a pagan."

Too much kitsch with Moore, Dalton just never seemed right, Brosnan was good but the Craig movies are darker and he's written as a flawed but more human character.

1306404100750356482 2020-09-17 09:26:24 +0800 <pete7505> @David_Charts @mtaibbi CDC has reported 195,352 deaths total, of which they claimed days ago 6% Covid 19 was the sole cause of death. Even disregarding the 6% claim, and accepting your extrapolated death rate of Canada, 195,352-100,000 =/= 200,000. Even an "armchair economist" can do better.

1302395209083486208 2020-09-06 07:56:29 +0800 <pete7505> @BruiserK @Super70sSports I sadly read this after posting.
1302392756178911232 2020-09-06 07:46:45 +0800 <pete7505> @Super70sSports Still don't know how he fit in a submarine.

But the notion that there needed to be accountability of the institutions who created the crisis (and instead were rewarded) was widespread and felt the entire breadth of the political spectrum. Maybe the muddying was organic. Sure felt like D&amp;C.

I was just trying to clarify. But I agree, I can't fathom what would allow a human to interact with another in this manner.
1302103360389238786 2020-09-05 12:36:47 +0800 <pete7505> @fuckyeahcollin @Timcast Native American filled with resentment tries to fill the empty space in this soul by sharing his pain with a stranger. Sad. Many such cases.
1302085683977256960 2020-09-05 11:26:33 +0800 <pete7505> @kmanguward GeneXer here. I can remember them from a book from the early 70's. I was kind of into them.
