1341716556317863938 2020-12-23 20:05:29 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> The reason I'm posting this is my mum does not see an issue and dismisses our (rather fucking obvious) concerns and instead has said it is "probably" one of her kind, generous, caring, and thoughtful friends who "went through a lot of hard effort to do this" Also a bloody stalker
1341713336984072193 2020-12-23 19:52:42 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> So this Xmas my mum has received a bauble with a photo of Nat and I in. We did not send this/sent anon, and the photo is from Nat's deactivated FB. Are we being crazy in thinking this is incredibly fucking creepy that someone we don't know made a bauble with our picture in? #Xmas

1329505471162703872 2020-11-20 03:22:59 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> Good day today. Covid test in the morning and got my negative result by 10:30, MRI in the afternoon went fine, just s couple more scans tomorrow and Monday, and the PS5 was delivered! Fun day all round!
1329445293457334273 2020-11-19 23:23:52 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @JoshuaGrubbsPhD Good points. Linked to taboo the porn changes aren't in the public consciousness. With PS5 releasing today here in the UK I've heard people discussing it on the radio every hour. You don't get that public awareness for the latest sex toy. looking forward to your paper now!
1329443833499836417 2020-11-19 23:18:04 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @JoshuaGrubbsPhD As in although the quality increases as well as access, a porn video from 05 would be similar to a porn video from 2020, while in video games the tech that comes with it vastly differs (see PS5 and the haptics compared to PS2 and the novelty of the controller vibrating weakly)
1329443500476276740 2020-11-19 23:16:45 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @JoshuaGrubbsPhD I'd be curious to see why you think this. As an outsider to the researcher I'd guess the thought is because of games/SM/Mobiles there's a more apparent 'step up' from gen to gen (e.g. video games from 05 &gt; 2020 vastly different) while porn would somewhat be the same throughout.
1329439649169862664 2020-11-19 23:01:26 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @MarkHaselgrove Think the hardest bit if it was an experimental paradigm would be measuring understanding, but something like comparative judgement with subject experts could work (getting experts can be tricky). Definitely potential in it and on a quick google scholar nothing really out there.
1329437050920202243 2020-11-19 22:51:07 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @MarkHaselgrove So things like when sentences stop, pauses etc? That's really interesting as it does force the transcriber to really listen to it. The occasional hippocampus/hippopotamus would help as well. Definitely trying this now. Transcribe and later a question testing understanding.
1329356314615615491 2020-11-19 17:30:18 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @MarkHaselgrove This is a really interesting idea, might try and implement it in my cognitive lectures next term. Are you just going through something like panopto? Right now doing a study on sleep affecting understanding of stats using lectures as stimuli and can see how it could transfer.
1329355478317625345 2020-11-19 17:26:58 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @shanelindsay I didn't think it would make much difference, but wow, it really does! The tactile elements really make it a better work experience and the clicking of blue switch keys really give my ADHD a reward moment every time I'm in the zone.

Second is in a bit of a pilot stage looking at how Bedtime reading/sleep and language learning, both new areas for me. Yours is an interesting idea!

1322587093814726658 2020-11-01 01:11:50 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @ucu raise important points that are just being ignored by the universities. In lockdown F2F teaching will just mean staff and students being disgruntled with it not being what it was pre-covid, getting burned out &amp; exposed. All this before we send students home for xmas...
1322587092594184195 2020-11-01 01:11:50 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> The commitment to online and this hybrid approach is taking a toll on staff and students. Here we've put in an additional compulsory 'lecture' for each module and students are burned out by it as are staff in generating dozens of new hours of content on short notice.
1322587091449118722 2020-11-01 01:11:49 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> Last online sessions I've had when the students are comfortable with using the platform were the best I've had, once they are willing to put on cam/mic it will be even better. To then go back to F2F (which many students  won't do) just seems crazty and puts staff at risk.
1322587090257924098 2020-11-01 01:11:49 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> Instead we have a hybrid where to cater for those online I still have to sit in front of a webcam and deliver everything through an online platform, except I've had to go to a different city to do it in an entirely pointless exercise of demonstrating F2F is still there
1322587089079275520 2020-11-01 01:11:49 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> But this isn't possible. Here we have had 2 weeks of F2F for RM, first and second week. First week 5/12 students turned up in person, the rest didn't appear online. Second week 1/12 in person and 7 online with the students commenting that didn't feel safe on campus
1322587087955255296 2020-11-01 01:11:48 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> Going through a student survey a lot are clamouring for F2F teaching but seem to want the pre-pandemic style but this literally isn't possible to keep people safe. I'd love to run Research methods sessions in person and be able to solve issues by talking to you
1322581026279985152 2020-11-01 00:47:43 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> Will be interesting to see how Universities respond to the latest #UKlockdown, will it try and continue F2F for staff even if students don't bother to turn up and just do it online (as my experience has been)
1322243270185988108 2020-10-31 02:25:36 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @DermotLynott Was looking for something just like this a few days ago!  https://t.co/o1jQ3aZpFy

1313727742597386240 2020-10-07 14:27:56 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @aidanhorner Only thing missing- clicker so mic doesn't pick up keyboard or mouse clicks when changing slides

1313512261240094722 2020-10-07 00:11:41 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> Before my lecture I played some Oasis/Gallagher bros in order to fill the time between students logging in and the lecture. Did not realise my mic was on and picking up me singing along to 243 students... #onlinelearning  https://t.co/qfkUkebiEt
1313490102681776135 2020-10-06 22:43:38 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> Having fun prepping for an Online Workshop. Student's still watch the Simpsons right? And know who Troy McClure is? #OnlineLectures  https://t.co/oNnBV9dTGO
1313373756291780608 2020-10-06 15:01:19 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> 5 mins into being back on campus for some F2F teaching I feel my MCL do *something* in me knee while walking and I'm now limping to the office.   This is not the workplace hazard I was expecting today.
1313373156296609793 2020-10-06 14:58:56 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @scotthunt92 Sancho will join the likes of Gaitan, Sneijder, and Strootman.  Oh well, we (technically) got 2 RW, excited to see Pellestri play. Said to be straight into the first team.
1313192307521400834 2020-10-06 03:00:18 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @scotthunt92 I'd put VdB over pogba at the moment. CB is a real need, I saw we signed a 16y old from Schaux I think? But straight in U18. Shame we aren't in for upacameno.   RW is still an issue, throwing 18yo Pellestri in isn't the answer and traore joins in January. Shame about Sancho
1313189858614095872 2020-10-06 02:50:34 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @scotthunt92 Overall window: VdB- happy with Telles- happy with, gives Shaw competition, let's Williams go to his natural side Cavani- need a back up striker, not enthused on his wage but he is a good alternative. Traore &amp; Pellestri- don't know enough about either of them. 7/10  You?
1313184689314762753 2020-10-06 02:30:02 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> Surprisingly long and busy day at work, but at least now I get to chill and relax by the slightly more stressful but infinitely more fun duty of being a @ManUtd fan on #DeadlineDay
1313127762308276224 2020-10-05 22:43:49 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @DermotLynott Cheers! Sadly admin stopped me from doing any work on it but I know for the next couple of days üëç
1313045459267710976 2020-10-05 17:16:47 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> Exciting day, going to do a new *first*. Starting work on my first proper preregistered paper! What are the best guides out there for this?  https://t.co/ZwQpK6DCe4
1312057878757478402 2020-10-02 23:52:29 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @aidanhorner Check out speedfan, it can tell you live temp for the fans, might be a case of overheating and this is countering it.
1312041568061345793 2020-10-02 22:47:41 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @aidanhorner But in all seriousness, hope it isn't too bad. Is it a fan? Maybe computer overheating? When was the last time it was cleaned?

Project is based on a 6 year pilot study that had promising results.

1308386498170048514 2020-09-22 20:43:44 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @DrGBuckingham @hisotalus Slightly related but I knew a family of Americans who sang "happy birthday to you" as Happy birthday, To you, Happy birthday, To you, Happy birthday, Dear ___ Happy birthday, To you.  It still is weird.

1306997146961489922 2020-09-19 00:42:57 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> Such a good week so far.

Hopefully more news to share soon too üëÄ
1306932950110535684 2020-09-18 20:27:51 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @DrGBuckingham @philip_fine It feels much more natural than on top as when checking slides your eyes are still around the camera instead of looking down. so far my only struggle has been when the tripod hid the key word in the slide 'Eudaimonic' and I need to see it to say it!

My partner just told me in her work's in house social media someone is offering her side business of hypnotherapy with '1h of hypnotherapy being as restorative as 10h of sleep due to its replicating effects of REM sleep'
1305552309221498887 2020-09-15 01:01:41 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @christine_blume One I've encountered a lot recently (online) is that we don't need sleep, instead we just need light exposure to feel fine.   It's so ridiculous but I'm seeing it more and more, like sleep is optional ü§¨

1304439757188083713 2020-09-11 23:20:48 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @DermotLynott 100%. Using my webcam mic it got roughly 80-90% right. Now using bluetooth headphones that have a mic built in and accuracy is near perfect (guessing only the accent is fooling it now).
1304033081683304449 2020-09-10 20:24:49 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @aidanhorner Gotta get your make up game on point if you want a recording of just your face on a Uni server for all time üôåüôå  https://t.co/DRdbyHmQwC

1304031880359145474 2020-09-10 20:20:02 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @aidanhorner I think near enough the same as long as it's LED. This is the one I got for ¬£18 and it does a job. This is the max height though, was good for my laptop (RIP) but a bit short for my monitor).   https://t.co/6iQLx3I8IM  https://t.co/z1g2ywxDDq
1304015912337575936 2020-09-10 19:16:35 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @DermotLynott I really wish this isn't as accurate as it was.  I was just confused why it wasn't working. Then I got the smell, then I wondered why the keyboard was still backlit.  Boy was I wrong.
1304012840370663424 2020-09-10 19:04:23 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> But now I will have arant. In the past week I've 1) paid ¬£731 to fix my car after various parts went wrong  2) My laptop   a) had the hard drive fail so spectacularly it could no longer find an OS  b) literally catch fire  3) Torn my rotator cuff again  Ready for Sept to end.
1304012179277045765 2020-09-10 19:01:45 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> @aidanhorner If you haven't already make sure to get a ring light. I still have a basic webcam but it's vastly improved quality of recordings.
1304011674249310208 2020-09-10 18:59:45 +0800 <JohnJJShaw> Back after another Twitter hiatus after last time as I was on AL and Academic Twitter with people (rightfully) complaining about COVID measures + odd feelings after Cousin's death made me want to retreat.
