1337171394770165761 2020-12-11 07:04:38 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> I can really see the powers in the Dim Party will use this to make the VP the new president.  Just give them time.
1333024742190747648 2020-11-29 20:27:19 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @IngrahamAngle This is wonderful news
1332009919504117761 2020-11-27 01:14:47 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @RepAdamSchiff I agree with your closing statement -- Yes YOU are!  Your hatred should not be allowed.
1332009501789204493 2020-11-27 01:13:07 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> This comes from my heart and needs to be read by all the Democrats that now suddenly believe it is time to heal!   https://t.co/Cjpq85c2j1
1330327463990353923 2020-11-22 09:49:18 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @BeschlossDC one corrupt judge that is probably on the take from china does not represent our entire legal system.
1330327101115916288 2020-11-22 09:47:51 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @BeschlossDC We will see.  It is far from over.
1330323331418124290 2020-11-22 09:32:53 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @KamalaHarris Don't forget to include your Communist Chinese Friends
1330314473475891201 2020-11-22 08:57:41 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @BeschlossDC Apparently the judge does not believe the two plaintiffs have a right to vote, and it was not indicative of fraud.
1330312209365426181 2020-11-22 08:48:41 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> I may not want your lifestyle or completely understand your culture, but you have the right to live your life in freedom. I am a true conservative American and regardless of the names that people enjoy calling me and the hatred they display. I will continue.
1330311754170200065 2020-11-22 08:46:52 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> The stories I could tell you about the children suffering and sometimes even becoming enslaved would break your heart if you care to listen to them.  I believe it is okay to be a different color and come from a different culture.  It is alright if you are gay or lesbian.
1330311651451691010 2020-11-22 08:46:28 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> I served in the military across 4 decades.  Now I am going into our public schools as a substitute to help during the China Virus crisis.(What started as a feeling that I should help has turned into a blessing as those kiddos enrich my life.)I love people and especially the kids
1330305747025080320 2020-11-22 08:23:00 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @TheDemocrats @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris And don't forget they get money from China also.
1330282621486718976 2020-11-22 06:51:07 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @KamalaHarris You cannot roll back his tax cuts without having everyone pay more!  The increase in corporate tax will cause fewer jobs and increased prices for goods
1330277519946375171 2020-11-22 06:30:50 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer I hope you brought along Hunter's checkbook so you can start writing checks to the American people that need it.
1330276453385121800 2020-11-22 06:26:36 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> If you have watched and been around as many socialist governments as I have this should not surprise you!  They all eventually grab all the power they can
1330159167806509057 2020-11-21 22:40:33 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> The CIA was involved in the Russia Hoax and thrives on deep state.  Of course they are
1330132745377505281 2020-11-21 20:55:33 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @JoeBiden Use the money Hunter got for you!

1329972597031890944 2020-11-21 10:19:11 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @KamalaHarris I agree with most others just ask Hunter and his friends for more money
1329591434073280512 2020-11-20 09:04:35 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @Acosta Non existent signatures those votes should not count if they cannot be verified

1329588563751694337 2020-11-20 08:53:10 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @JackPosobiec It doesn't
1329588222427602950 2020-11-20 08:51:49 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @Acosta TDS---The news media is no longer a free and open press it is just a part of the liberal left that serves no true purpose or aids freedom and democracy in any way shape or form
1329587693219688448 2020-11-20 08:49:43 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @DrBiden let us see if he can encourage the house to honestly make a deal to get covid relief
1329580807191715840 2020-11-20 08:22:21 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @CBSNews go home and cry in your ice cream like pelogi

1329386369655984128 2020-11-19 19:29:43 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> They are beginning to set up to take Biden out of the picture so Harris can be president.  It is what big money wanted all along
1329385772466790401 2020-11-19 19:27:21 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @CarlyFiorina Inadequate people always complain and find fault with others while failing to see their own.  Trump did more to for Americans than you can every dream of!
1329215318208614401 2020-11-19 08:10:02 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @NYGovCuomo Shutting down schools and then going to large dinners with your other democrat cronies will probably help cure all the peons

1329212541898289153 2020-11-19 07:59:00 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @ewarren Have the Univeristies end the way they waste money and cut back on costs so that they are affordable.  Unless we hold them accountable for their own finances it will fix nothing to just keep throwing money at them.  You my lady are an idiot.
1329211962484551682 2020-11-19 07:56:42 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @DineshDSouza @PatHensley14 I will praise when praise is due and criticize when it is due!  I did it for Trump.  I did it for Obama!  When someone does something wrong that does not mean that I will.  I will always believe that Trump is one of the best Presidents we have ever had.
1329210976315592705 2020-11-19 07:52:46 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @SpeakerPelosi Great!  Now you can go home and eat Ice Cream

1327988818205663232 2020-11-15 22:56:21 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> Any Vote from a precinct that did not allow poll watchers needs to be thrown out.  All precincts that did not follow the law cannot be allowed to influence illegally.  It is not the peoples fault that voted it is the democratic party that disenfranchised them.

1321572435834114048 2020-10-29 05:59:56 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @JoeBiden I think Mussolini's almost as corrupt as the Biden Family
1321568993027772420 2020-10-29 05:46:16 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> I wouldn't follow this guy anywhere no matter how much money he has.  WOW I have seen homeless that look saner than he does  https://t.co/aU3LDSSAwH
1321564570012573697 2020-10-29 05:28:41 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @JoeBiden Because the only thing you have done is copy his plan and get money from the criminals that released it on the world.
1321563377471246337 2020-10-29 05:23:57 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @SexCounseling I have known it for years.  They became more powerful and adept at hiding their behavior after 9/11.  Too much power and secrecy was given to them at that point.  It has gradually gotten worse since then.  Eventually they controlled the FBI and CIA
1321552030792646658 2020-10-29 04:38:52 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @JoeBiden We deserve someone who is not corrupt and will sometimes work a full day without calling a lid #TrumpLandslideVictory2020
1321546727858589698 2020-10-29 04:17:47 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @MichaelJFell @Franklin_Graham I have seen Jesus condemn abominations but I have seen marriages that qualify as such.  I have never heard of Jesus condemning honest love and devotion.  You may not like it but Jesus did not hang with too many goody-two-shoes.

1321455806194307073 2020-10-28 22:16:30 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @JoeBiden stop pandering to criminals and for once support law and order!  Oh I forgot you obviously do not want law and order it would cause your family to go broke!

1320004274772992008 2020-10-24 22:08:38 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> WOW I gotta get me one of these it is so cool.  It would be great for Halloween.  Somebody is really going off the deep end.  I bet within a month the tv media will be wearing them!
1320003552727699463 2020-10-24 22:05:46 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @Eventhedogsabo1 Must be animal cruelty then to give dogs the rabies vaccine!
1320002818141507584 2020-10-24 22:02:50 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> It has been building for many years
1320002448925360128 2020-10-24 22:01:22 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @Eventhedogsabo1 @RepThomasMassie Same with small pox i suppose.  It is now increasing again because of people not taking it.  Don't get me wrong the government should not force anyone to take it but they should also not keep it from people that want it.  It should work both ways
1320000752274853889 2020-10-24 21:54:38 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @Eventhedogsabo1 @RepThomasMassie Sorry I remember polio and you are just wrong!
1319972156873281537 2020-10-24 20:01:00 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> Vaccines have helped cure many of the worlds worst pandemics.  To generate fear of them just is not logical.

1319971361016713217 2020-10-24 19:57:51 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @ArmyBratt68 Ever since J. Edgar Hoover the FBI has kept files on the elite.  Usually just to keep them in case they need the influence or to use a political power and keep everyone under control.  That is why the deep state fears and fights Trump so much
1319970635678875649 2020-10-24 19:54:58 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @CHIZMAGA @deedeeprospertx It does not,.  But will protect from droplets.  Unless you are in a weakened or are compromised in some other way the body can fight off small amounts of the virus.  A mask is just one layer of protection like putting on a coat when it is cold.
1319969368667807744 2020-10-24 19:49:55 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @PeteButtigieg Please the mandate should be left to state and local governments and not foolishly mandated where it is not needed.  More government mandates is not the solution.  What we need is the vaccine to be approved!
1319968691694505984 2020-10-24 19:47:14 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @RepThomasMassie Your negative view of vaccines is just what the democrats want.  Negative comments about vaccines are going to cause more deaths that the media will blame on anything else but the themselves.
1319961516087627779 2020-10-24 19:18:43 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @RepThomasMassie I don't understand.  We have been vaccinating children for decades and you don't think we should give the vaccine to children?
1319960210023342080 2020-10-24 19:13:32 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @RepThomasMassie This just proves that even if you study medicine it does not mean you have any common sense or support freedom.
1319959421108342784 2020-10-24 19:10:24 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> Even for Halloween that is a scary thought
1319959119596584960 2020-10-24 19:09:12 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @FGodement Of course he will it would mean more money for his family!
1319957780430807040 2020-10-24 19:03:53 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> Everyone knows that politicians are corrupt but it now seems that the more corrupt they are the more votes they get.

1319742828428349440 2020-10-24 04:49:44 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @JoeBiden His numbers would of been better than yours  -- considering you called hem xenophobic when he started limiting flights from china.  It would have spread faster and further under you
1319607778101612544 2020-10-23 19:53:06 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @bartmckinley It is easy to see that Trump will kill the Golden Goose that has been furnishing money to politicians for years!  No wonder they hate him so much.
1319607275011641346 2020-10-23 19:51:06 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @bette_oh @jimeh5 She also tried to talk over him while he was answering.  It is hard to debate two people especially when one has a mute button.
1319605881982636032 2020-10-23 19:45:34 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @JoeBiden go get more money from china and maybe while you are there you can bring back another virus
1319605444185329666 2020-10-23 19:43:49 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> No he is not lying he said he was going to get rid of the oil industry and he will do that if elected.  Not looking forward to the high gas prices again.

Joe Biden has an obligation to answer questions about his sonâ€™s influence-peddling and his own financial dealingsâ€”notably regarding China.  https://t.co/kh0MgqWOs6 via @WSJ
1318860993817083904 2020-10-21 18:25:38 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> The U.S. Supreme Court denied requests for a stay on a Pennsylvania ballot deadline extension. That extension could haunt the Justices on Nov. 4.  https://t.co/qW42H3SPqD via @WSJ

1318566511070617611 2020-10-20 22:55:28 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> This is the healthcare the left wants!

They are the deepest part of the deep state and would like the rest of us to just shut up and follow their directions

They talk a great game (almost like some of the groups in his day), but produce only??  What has he really done for the oppressed?  Have you even looked?
1318497186645200902 2020-10-20 18:20:00 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @LauraMagdalene4 Perhaps there is some environmentally friendly company out there that Hunter can be on the board of.  That could help the biden environment

1318333488861532160 2020-10-20 07:29:31 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> The Philadelphia Inquirerâ€™s Jonathan Tamari reported  What did the University of Pennsylvania get for the more than $900,000 it has paid Joe Biden? Joe collected $371,159 in 2017 plus $540,484 in 2018 and early 2019 for  no regular classes and around a dozen public appearances
1318332781081088001 2020-10-20 07:26:43 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @RBReich Does that mean the #CorruptBiden Family will return all the money from Ukraine and China?
1318331877669756928 2020-10-20 07:23:07 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> Corinne Weaver and Alec Schemmel at NewsBusters report: Twitter and Facebook have censored the presidentâ€™s social media accounts and the accounts t least 65 times. In contrast, the companies have not censored former Vice President and  Joe Biden and his campaign accounts. At all.
1318330931095232512 2020-10-20 07:19:22 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> Finally the WSJ is starting to speak out!  Have the Bidens Denied the Story Yet?  https://t.co/aSDQXqishx via @WSJ

1317245018357288960 2020-10-17 07:24:20 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> It is being hinted at that Hunter Biden was into kiddie porn..Could this be the reason Qanon is so hated?
1317242825961050114 2020-10-17 07:15:37 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @InGodIDoTrust I think it strange that the left seems to hate them so very much.  Hollywood types have always drifted toward pedophilia so it is no wonder the media is so dead set against them.
1317241110301954050 2020-10-17 07:08:48 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @JoeBiden After you get funds from China of course and raise our taxes.  #CrookedJoeBiden

1317070010385375232 2020-10-16 19:48:55 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> And we wonder why the left loves pedophiles so much?  We sexualize them at a very early age?  They need to be older before they are forced by adults to change sex

1311460265611988992 2020-10-01 08:17:47 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @JoeBiden Sleepy joe it sounds like your ANTIFA comment will turn into a mistake like the Obama JV comment did.
1311458557913706496 2020-10-01 08:11:00 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @AmandaSeitz @Beatrice_Dupuy That is not even close to being believable!  Never seen a rosary look like that!
1311457395340726272 2020-10-01 08:06:23 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @bigbettyblack45 @LegallyAutumn Trump
1311457066121408513 2020-10-01 08:05:04 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @InfidelAngela @boxersforlife I will be first in line!
1311455916542300160 2020-10-01 08:00:30 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> More truth about the China Virus   https://t.co/lN9Kb6MmOb
1311329270678138881 2020-09-30 23:37:16 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @Scaramucci I vote to re-elect Trump.  How can anyone believe someone that has been there for 49 years is the answer?
1311328747598098432 2020-09-30 23:35:11 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> This is really the one I have been wondering about.  Most of the violence was caused by ANTIFA and BLM not the other groups??
1311324762933792771 2020-09-30 23:19:21 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> Like when Obama called Al-Qaeda the JV isn't it!
1311324520414879744 2020-09-30 23:18:23 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @willchamberlain @IndianaMAGAMike Kind of like when Obama called Al-Qaeda the JV
1310741832301772800 2020-09-29 08:42:59 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> Has anyone heard about the 911 outage??
1309858106470531073 2020-09-26 22:11:23 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @LannyDavis good riddance
1309856694734909442 2020-09-26 22:05:46 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @ericbolling not now
1308941585992777730 2020-09-24 09:29:27 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @SpeakerPelosi It is a shame that you know so little about the law.
1308778128358223873 2020-09-23 22:39:56 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @PeteButtigieg Upholding the constitution is such a messy job...but I guess it is just to much for you to understand.  There are about 3100 counties in the states.  Trump took over 3000 of them.  Why should a few big cities that cannot take care of themselves rule the rest of us?
1308198300324163585 2020-09-22 08:15:54 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @Brown43Doug @IdahoLady7 It was never to protect it was to slow the spread.  This is what has been said from the very start.  It does decrease the amount you spread the disease when you have it.  protection?? where have you been all this time and what kind of drugs are you on??
1308195720235806721 2020-09-22 08:05:39 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> Update on media bias and the virus from the great state of Indiana  https://t.co/jbNTl1zwcb
1307492382527676416 2020-09-20 09:30:50 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @mzad2012 @JoeBiden Good-bye Joe
1304524946169901068 2020-09-12 04:59:18 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> Prob ably the best commercial ever
1303448567307264000 2020-09-09 05:42:10 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> Wow even the dem vp does not take questions
1303287358100590592 2020-09-08 19:01:34 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @SpeakerPelosi Time to get another haircut Nancy!
1303286878934892546 2020-09-08 18:59:40 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> This could be once again the Dems and the hoodlums they pay trying to sabotage Trump and his attempts to improve the system.
1303285695386189825 2020-09-08 18:54:58 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> Great piece of art!  Amazing
1303282267930988544 2020-09-08 18:41:21 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> The state of Indiana is doing real well but the media in general has crashed and burned.  https://t.co/VydgGvEjCE
1302718296710619136 2020-09-07 05:20:19 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> Rather than try another top-down initiative to reform education, Idaho gives seventh graders $4,125 each to customize their high-school educations, writes @maxeden99  https://t.co/HpAAZCDPRn via @WSJ
1302688385988001793 2020-09-07 03:21:28 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> How about normal people that are just plain tired of the corruption and riots??
1302688086585937927 2020-09-07 03:20:17 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> And this is a good idea for a VP pick?
1302346571003068418 2020-09-06 04:43:13 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> Sad but true.  There is nothting good that I have seen come out of donations to BLM
1301645942437879809 2020-09-04 06:19:10 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @tedwheeler Yes and if you ran your city with a little common sense and humanity it would be in much better shape.  We do not need to send you our money just to have you flush it down your toilet
1301235762667687941 2020-09-03 03:09:16 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> Portland may well go from extremely bad to even worse.  Now they want to elect a Fascist!   https://t.co/t6MXJvoNUa
1301234803577102339 2020-09-03 03:05:27 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> What a piece of work.  She believes she is above the law!  It is time to get her out of office.  Start a recall NOW!
1301233833367547907 2020-09-03 03:01:36 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> @JAMESROMANO926 I am 72 and I know if I catch it the result will probably be pretty bad.  That being said it does not slow me down any.  I have started working as a substitute teacher because it is important for those kids to be in class and having a teacher standing in front of them.
1301188551623806976 2020-09-03 00:01:40 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> This guy is insane and he is what is running this county school system??  The guy is nuts.  I am 72 and I am subbing to help out at schools and the schools here are pretty much open.  This is not education
1301187112222429185 2020-09-02 23:55:57 +0800 <TheOldCrabb> China is trying to influence the election.  Any Lame Street media that tells you different is paid by China.
