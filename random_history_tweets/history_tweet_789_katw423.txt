1342898831013404676 2020-12-27 02:23:25 +0800 <katw423> @Dr13600962 Huge THANK YOU to you &amp; your best friend for your generosity &amp; for all the other help you're providing i.e. working with LG for appliances &amp; vetting of lady in need with GoFundMe page, etc.
1342895582470430722 2020-12-27 02:10:31 +0800 <katw423> @Istandfortheru1 @glennkirschner2 I think I'd rather seen Glenn run the #TruthandCrimes Commission. But I could get behind him being AG too because #JusticeMatters
1342894559089602562 2020-12-27 02:06:27 +0800 <katw423> @GayNels87004422 @thomaskaine5 No doubt!   Just need someone that gives appearance of not being on vendetta, someone who seems non-partisan.
1342893946037542912 2020-12-27 02:04:01 +0800 <katw423> @James21700046 @thomaskaine5 I like Schiff but regardless whether district is safe or not there's others issues, such as any investigations or prosecutions for those in 45's admin would probably be seen as retaliation. What about Chuck Rosenberg or Joyce Vance? Too bad Maya Wiley is running for NYC Mayor
1342890673708654596 2020-12-27 01:51:00 +0800 <katw423> @micheletristan @thomaskaine5 He could be right person, but to me, he just seems to be too willing to "get along", not upset the apple cart so to speak, in which case he may not aggressive enough to go after previous admin wrong doing.
1342889229874032641 2020-12-27 01:45:16 +0800 <katw423> @TheresaKereakes @thomaskaine5 Biden has chosen 2 people currently serving in the House for Cabinet positions = Marcia Fudge &amp; Deb Haaland
1342587423797207040 2020-12-26 05:46:00 +0800 <katw423> @thomaskaine5 I'd love that too but we can't afford to lose any Dems from House or Senate. Biden will need to choose someone not in Congress.   There are many he can choose from. Just hope he chooses someone with guts &amp; who's not going to overlook all wrongs done by this current corrupt regime
1342584968980131847 2020-12-26 05:36:15 +0800 <katw423> @JonFlan Sorry, but that's insulting to rats. Not sure how to make an icon of it but cesspool would be more appropriate. Guess we'll just have to use 💩as their symbol.

I now call it Rethuglican party. Anti-democracy, anti-people, anti-ethical, anti-moral they're the anti party unless you're corp
1342573400284397570 2020-12-26 04:50:17 +0800 <katw423> @glennkirschner2 Hope your Christmas has been &amp; will continue to be a happy, joyful day.  Thank you for sharing your optimism &amp; insights here &amp; in your YouTube videos. That's a great gift to give all of us.

1335622596663111680 2020-12-07 00:30:16 +0800 <katw423> @AdrBell @ChrisChristianL #McConnell is one person representative democracy killer.  He does not represent me, my state or anyone not resident of KY. I'm tired of him not allowing *MY* elected Senator to vote on bills that may be beneficial to my state OR for ALL Americans.
1335619156272697345 2020-12-07 00:16:36 +0800 <katw423> America definitely doesn't need #TraitorTrump selling Intel secrets to pay off debt, get hotel deals or whatever. He doesn't care about America, our democracy, or our allies.   Ex-Presidents Can Get Intel Briefings. Trump Shouldn’t.  https://t.co/RR63ZANeIr via @thedailybeast
1334624029337120776 2020-12-04 06:22:19 +0800 <katw423> @TheUSASingers #Cult45 MAGAt's are incapable of or tired of thinking, reasoning or being rational, therefore they want dicktator #tRump to tell them what to think &amp; do, when &amp; how. They're want to act like newborn babies being coddled &amp; every need taken care of.
1334623087011262464 2020-12-04 06:18:34 +0800 <katw423> @SenAlexander I will ALWAYS remember what you wrote to me, that you didn't need more witnesses in trump's impeachment hearing because you KNEW he was guilty but said election was coming up. How's that working out for America? You're an #EpicFailure

He's 1-man democracy destroyer by refusing to allow other state Senators to represent THEIR constituents.  Come on Georgia PLEASE vote for #Ossoff &amp; #Warnock to #FlipSenateBlue Demote Mitch to minority
1334618438078259203 2020-12-04 06:00:06 +0800 <katw423> Preach it, Eddie Glaude   Selfishness is exactly what I've been saying since #coronavirus began, well before that too but.  Until someone is personally impacted by #covid19 they don't care about anyone else. What happened to #GoldenRule?  @esglaude @NicolleDWallace @DeadlineWH
1334614868138323968 2020-12-04 05:45:55 +0800 <katw423> @PuddinCusp @MarkoSilberhand @politvidchannel Same here.    I've feared &amp; talked about this since #MangoMussolini took office. We were derided as alarmists.   For some reason I can't reply to @MarkoSilberhand's tweet.
1334612995041792011 2020-12-04 05:38:28 +0800 <katw423> @Wendilynn66 I said #LeningradLindsey needed to be investigated the day that story broke. Glad someone with law degree finally formally asked for one.
1334612122643406851 2020-12-04 05:35:00 +0800 <katw423> @ProjectLincoln #VoteOssoff4Senate  #VoteWarnock4Senate  #DitchMitch, "vote out" the biggest obstructionist, representative democracy killer in our lifetime.   Come on Georgia #DemoteMcConnell to minority "leader".

1334609940565069824 2020-12-04 05:26:20 +0800 <katw423> @funder @Gdad1 If #Georgia Dems don't win those 2 Senate races we'll be complicit in destruction of government property since all those House passed bills will be stacked so high for so long on obstructionist #McConnell's desk the weight of them will cause it to collapse into pile of wood.
1334608226650906624 2020-12-04 05:19:31 +0800 <katw423> @ReverendWarnock @KLoeffler @Perduesenate And right in line with #RevWarnock's tweet comes this from @RBReich    https://t.co/UDZCZwDrNj
1334607395142705152 2020-12-04 05:16:13 +0800 <katw423> @ReverendWarnock @KLoeffler @Perduesenate And fighting hard to help #McConnell destroy our representative democracy. They only care about their power, &amp; obtaining more $ than anyone could ever use in lifetime while denying ordinary Americans #coronavirus help, healthcare, keeping food on table &amp; roof over their head.
1334593788845699080 2020-12-04 04:22:09 +0800 <katw423> Just curious when #Tulsi will change her party affiliation to #trumplican because she's sure not democrat &amp; doesn't care about democracy. #Rethug would suit her so much better.
1334592298101911554 2020-12-04 04:16:14 +0800 <katw423> @laurenvpass @ToddKolod Sadly, #Cult45 MAGAt's don't care about truth or facts.   They should care about their OWN interests which neither #Loeffler nor #McConnell care about. They're only interested in their own power, grifting &amp; taking care of their rich donors.
1334590979224068098 2020-12-04 04:10:59 +0800 <katw423> @Sbh08Mae @MarkoSilberhand If people want to insure THEIR duly elected Senators are able to do THEIR job for THEIR constituents &amp; Congress is not gridlocked by obstructionist #McConnell then PLEASE vote  #Ossoff4Senate  #Warnock4Senate  Otherwise, #CryptKeeperMitch will block every bill he doesn't like.
1334584737806028805 2020-12-04 03:46:11 +0800 <katw423> @EricLiptonNYT Maybe it's just odd to me that an email referring to hotel rates has the subject line of "buyout minimum".  How do we know this is "instructing the hotel" to charge fair market rate, it could be referring to any number of things.
1334578842443321345 2020-12-04 03:22:45 +0800 <katw423> When you see #TraitorTots trending, it doesn't take a genius to know who it's talking about.   How sad it is that the pathetic #POSpotus &amp; his #tRumpCrimeFamily are so corrupt, unAmerican &amp; fascist that treason is 1st word that comes to mind about all of them.
1334561772175585288 2020-12-04 02:14:56 +0800 <katw423> Even tho they don't discuss #MuellerReport this interview was still very interesting.   Robert Mueller does rare interview in 'Oath' podcast  https://t.co/vJ3iHohaja

1331981540121858051 2020-11-26 23:22:00 +0800 <katw423> @glennkirschner2 I'm extremely thankful for you &amp; your positivity. I get pessimistic &amp; jaded about #45 or anyone in #tRumpCrimeSyndicate will ever be held accountable for damage done to our democracy &amp; country. I can only hope NY state *NEVER* elects GOP Gov or else #45 could get pardoned there.
1331980433744154628 2020-11-26 23:17:37 +0800 <katw423> @glennkirschner2 My fear for next 50+ days is what Fed crimes #CriminalInChief will commit knowing he's #AboveTheLaw. It's why we must fight for justice &amp; against these corrupt pardons. #JusticeMatters  Thanks (not) #GOP enablers for not removing this #OrangeMenace from office when you had chance

1331970161545535489 2020-11-26 22:36:47 +0800 <katw423> @glennkirschner2 I agree these pardons MUST be challenged in court. It makes no sense that prez could murder someone &amp; be protected forever &amp; never held accountable. Same w/#TrumpCrimeSyndicate crimes.  Maybe eventually this complicit, enabling #GOP will be held accountable too for allowing it.
1331966284188225538 2020-11-26 22:21:23 +0800 <katw423> Listening to @allinwithchris Wed show &amp; ad said Chuck Rosenburg's podcast "The Oath" is returning next Wed &amp; he'll be interviewing Robert Mueller.

1331031865440997376 2020-11-24 08:28:20 +0800 <katw423> @Monaheart1229 Yep, I was listening via Tune-In app but when I heard her I quickly tuned out &amp; turned off.   Come on @TheBeatWithAri do better. We don't need to hear anything this witch with a "b" has to say.   #thebeat
1331030499696009219 2020-11-24 08:22:55 +0800 <katw423> @TheRickWilson It's pretty obvious #LoserInChief did NOT write that tweet himself, too many big words, complete sentences but the giveway is sounding like he cares what #EmilyMurphy has been going thru. We KNOW he's not capable of empathy &amp; does NOT care about anyone but himself.
1330962387277647876 2020-11-24 03:52:15 +0800 <katw423> @B52Malmet The rethugs are asking "court to strike down an expanded mail ballot policy that Pennsylvania put in place last year after it was passed by the state's **GOP-held** legislature" (* emphasis mine)  You just can't make this stuff up.
1330959888298745857 2020-11-24 03:42:20 +0800 <katw423> @5gatos Unfortunately what will most likely happen is they'll return to their town &amp; go to church, grocery store, restaurants, etc &amp; spread it to those who had NO choice about their decision. Some of those innocents may die because of it but these selfish #maskholes will never know it.

1330554554857951235 2020-11-23 00:51:41 +0800 <katw423> @Paul_VanDerMeer #NoPardonForTrump If our laws are to have any meaning then #45 should be investigated &amp; prosecuted. No one is above then law. NO ONE.   If we allow him &amp; his cronies to get away with their crimes, then why even have laws?   All must be held accountable for their crimes.

It sure helped their evening line up.   Some afternoon hosts just regurgitate the same news hour after hour after hour. No insightful stuff + stupid questions, not worth my eyeballs,
1330534474753433600 2020-11-22 23:31:53 +0800 <katw423> @charlesbethea Seems to me that #SidneyPowell needs to be investigated by @FBI for threat to "blow up" GA. If she doesn't have the means to do it personally, she's inciting violence &amp; likely another #Cult45 supporter will try it.   Let's not forget #CesarSayoc
1330530978998136832 2020-11-22 23:18:00 +0800 <katw423> @GeneMcDonald88 @DrJasonJohnson @amjoyshow I second that thought @MSNBC.   Lose #ChuckTodd for sure. And sorry I just can't get into Andrea Mitchell, time for her to go also.
1330530228431679497 2020-11-22 23:15:01 +0800 <katw423> @DrJasonJohnson @amjoyshow I love when you host @MSNBC shows, they SHOULD give you your own show. The energy in your voice early in the morning is contagious &amp; makes my day start off right, even when the news is depressing.    #AMJoy
1330353569678155779 2020-11-22 11:33:02 +0800 <katw423> Come on #Georgia vote #Warnock for Senate. GA &amp; America NEEDS people like him who understands the #DignityOfWork. Essential people who are often looked down upon for work they do, whose value is seen as less than others. For those that can't earn living wage.  #FlipTheSenateBlue
1330349483473907714 2020-11-22 11:16:48 +0800 <katw423> @mmpadellan I can't believe anyone would hire #KayleighMcEnany or any of these #Cult45 liars but they'll get hired &amp; make more $$ than majority of Americans.   Not sure where saying "crime doesn't pay" comes from but with this admin it's just another lie coz it sure seems to pay very good.
1330348045356191745 2020-11-22 11:11:05 +0800 <katw423> @glennkirschner2 How many frivolous lawsuits can one person bring before Judge says #EnoughIsEnough?    Can Judge make #45 pay the States legal expenses? It's costing states lots of money to defend against these lawsuits.   How many legit lawsuits are being pushed back because of them?

We can't let future prez &amp; other political officials think they're above the law just because Dems think it will help create unity. No it won't. #MangoMussolini needs to be held accountable for damage he's done to our democracy PLUS all other wrongs he's done.

1329508585416650752 2020-11-20 03:35:22 +0800 <katw423> @tribelaw South Carolina should be looking into #Graham's re-election since he's willing to pressure another state to throw election then you can damn sure bet he'd do so to save his own re-election. How could polls be so wrong for that Senate race?!
1329502028217937922 2020-11-20 03:09:19 +0800 <katw423> @JoyceWhiteVance I have no compassion for #EmilyMurphy since she took an oath to uphold the Constitution. All she has to do is follow the law. There shouldn't be ANY wavering or question of what is right thing to do when you're loyal to our COUNTRY &amp; DEMOCRACY.

Until Jan 20th, when we finally boot this #OrangeMenace from OUR House, let's hope he doesn't nuke Great Barrier Reef over this fantastic, truthful video. He IS vindictive

In other words, not much different than he treats humans.
1322201363745525772 2020-10-30 23:39:05 +0800 <katw423> @nywolforg Another thing I feared in 2016 before #OrangeMenace got elected = destruction of wildlife protections, land protections, clean water &amp; air. He's making #environment much much worse by removing all these protections, while causing deaths of wolves, bears &amp; people.   Pls #VoteBiden
1322199525524676609 2020-10-30 23:31:46 +0800 <katw423> @MollyJongFast And #OrangeMenace is conning his #cult45 followers into believing there is no pandemic &amp; #coronavirus is going away or "rounding the curve".   How can people believe #LiarInChief's crap when infection rates are reaching new highs almost daily.
1322196389787586561 2020-10-30 23:19:19 +0800 <katw423> @CNNPolitics And another drank too much #koolaid.   #Cult45 has some very powerful koolaid, making it easier to con people. #OrangeMenace knows what to say which is what people want to hear. Problem is he's liar &amp; all talk &amp; NO action. He's expert #ConArtist trying to buy black votes.

Yes I intentionally misspelled sycophants because they're sickos.

1320030520596627458 2020-10-24 23:52:55 +0800 <katw423> @MSNBC 29 of 40 drugs used to treat #covid19 are running in short supply.   "Another 67 out of 156 critical acute drugs -- including diazepam, phenobarbital, lidocaine and acetaminophen -- are in short supply, the report said."   https://t.co/fl6XChfHkM
1320029557446103046 2020-10-24 23:49:06 +0800 <katw423> @MSNBC Another #fake photo op for #FakePotus  224,000+ Americans dead from #coronavirus is NOT fake tho. Yet he STILL DOES NOTHING to stop spread, help Americans, or front line workers who are running out of drugs to treat patients. He got his treatment that's all that matters to him.
1320028394592010241 2020-10-24 23:44:28 +0800 <katw423> @MSNBC I only wish #MangoMussolini would've had to wait in the long line like other Americans.   #VoterSuppressionIsReal
1320028058045341697 2020-10-24 23:43:08 +0800 <katw423> @OlgaNYC1211 @NoUserNameVIX @LindseyGrahamSC Other than Dobbs going on &amp; on about #ObamaGate conspiracy theory &amp; he's pissed #LeningradLindsey never investigated non-existent conspiracy, I agree with most of what he said. And what #DonTheCon said about #LindsayGraham in 2016.

1320023805901885444 2020-10-24 23:26:14 +0800 <katw423> #FlipTheSenateBlue &amp; help restore our democracy as it SHOULD be, not as cheating rethugs want it. They can't win fairly so they lie, cheat, steal &amp; try to #SuppressTheVote.   Once Dems have control of all 3 branches of govt we WILL end #VoterSuppression.   #VoteBlueDownTheBallot
1320022038459912195 2020-10-24 23:19:13 +0800 <katw423> Sorry let me clarify, #Ivanka &amp; #Kushner have not sued #LincolnProject, they are THREATENING to sue. Want to make sure I state facts.   2 members of #tRumpCrimeSyndicate threatening to sue over #truth, that's so special.
1320020180781629442 2020-10-24 23:11:50 +0800 <katw423> @thomaskaine5 Most of what I think I don't want to type here but she's spoiled, empty vessel who has NO clue how real Americans live. She's nothing more than real #PlasticBarbie. Only Barbie had several different jobs which makes her more aware of real life than #Ivanka.
1320017374242885633 2020-10-24 23:00:41 +0800 <katw423> To my followers, sorry for RT'ing this so many times but it's the one @IvankaTrump &amp; @jaredkushner don't want anyone to see &amp; are suing @ProjectLincoln over.   So I'm going to RT it as much as possible because well, #FreeSpeech &amp; 1st amendment matters as does our #Constitution

1319477695177252869 2020-10-23 11:16:11 +0800 <katw423> @DrGJackBrown Because #MangoMussolini IS lying.   His sons bragged about how much money #45 got from Russians.   We don't know how much money he may have gotten since he's been #POSpotus. We will once #TrumpCrimesCommission investigates.   #JusticeIsComing

1319471569945636864 2020-10-23 10:51:51 +0800 <katw423> Gotta love @maddow's take on #KristenWelker winning the debate &amp; other comments about this #PresidentialDebate2020.   I just love her.
1319470336514101249 2020-10-23 10:46:57 +0800 <katw423> If #PresidentialDebate2020 has shown anything it's that we simply **MUST** #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica   And we **MUST** #FlipTheSenateBlue in order for Dems to get anything done.
1319468992705236999 2020-10-23 10:41:37 +0800 <katw423> This week may not have been good time to try to quit smoking.   I'm trying to cut way back 1st &amp; think about every cig I smoke to break that mental habit but damn I sure shouldn't have watched this #PresidentialDebate2020. I've smoke more during it than whole past week.
1319467537692823552 2020-10-23 10:35:50 +0800 <katw423> WTF is #MangoMussolini going on about fumes coming up from windmills?  Never mind. I forgot for fraction of second who I was talking about.   #PresidentialDebate2020
1319466836023455745 2020-10-23 10:33:02 +0800 <katw423> #PresidentialDebate2020   I agree
1319465197472546818 2020-10-23 10:26:32 +0800 <katw423> @JoshuaPotash God, did #MangoMussolini really say that. I missed it. I've had to tune out #PresidentialDebate2020 since it reminded me too much of #tRumpRally full of lies.
1319464155464740870 2020-10-23 10:22:23 +0800 <katw423> @donwinslow Think I read #KristenWelker would NOT be fact checking their statements. That's so wrong IMHO.   Still say we need big red LIE pop up on screen whenever #LiarInChief lies. Kinda like that big red X on Family Feud.   #PresidentialDebate2020
1319463064639557634 2020-10-23 10:18:03 +0800 <katw423> I'm with God on this one.    #PresidentialDebate2020
1319462707121238024 2020-10-23 10:16:38 +0800 <katw423> @RBReich I think he left out few words as in "no one has done more - to facilitate the killing of blacks than me".   #PresidentialDebate2020
1319462140659552256 2020-10-23 10:14:23 +0800 <katw423> #PresidentialDebate2020   Again just seems this #TrumpCrimeSyndicate is above the law &amp; rules.   Why are they not being asked to leave as Debate Commission said they'd do if people refused to wear masks?   #Maskholes
1319461046332104704 2020-10-23 10:10:02 +0800 <katw423> TRUTH!   You'll never hear that from #MangoMussolini tho. He only cares about his #cult45 people. Well, that's wrong too he doesn't care about ANYONE but himself. He demands "favors" from blue states, just like Ukraine which got him impeached.   #PresidentialDebate2020
1319460031860002822 2020-10-23 10:06:00 +0800 <katw423> #PresidentialDebate2020   Listen to truth from #farmer. Not just 1st time farmer one who's farm has been around for 200 yrs. Question is will it survive #MangoMussolini's prez term? Only with continuing taxpayer funded bailouts   All because of #45's tariff trade war.
1319458935540224002 2020-10-23 10:01:39 +0800 <katw423> #PresidentialDebate2020   #45's #Healthcare plan  Watch to find out what it is.
1319458390234583041 2020-10-23 09:59:29 +0800 <katw423> EVERY F'ING question #LiarInChief LIES. I'm so over this #POSPotus.   Pelosi &amp; House passed a bill back MAY. Talk to your #Cult45 #GOP enablers as to why no #Covid19 relief bill has been passed. It's been sitting in #MoscowMitch' desk all that time   #PresidentialDebate2020
1319457083713064960 2020-10-23 09:54:17 +0800 <katw423> Me, me, me. This whole #PresidentialDebate2020 has been about #MangoMussolini  himself.
1319455992174792705 2020-10-23 09:49:57 +0800 <katw423> Oh god more lies about #Obamacare &amp; pre-existing conditions  He has NO plans for #healthcare for millions of Americans   I don't have healthcare because I can't afford $800+/month for insurance. How many people can afford that much PER MONTH just for health insurance?
1319454654179250177 2020-10-23 09:44:38 +0800 <katw423> Farmers received #taxpayer funded bailout because of #MangoMussolini's tariff war with China.   The bailout was akin to vote buying. Did crab fishers, lobster fishers receive a bailout? Not that I know of.   China DOES NOT PAY for bailouts. AMERICANS DO.   #PresidentialDebate2020
1319453555674284037 2020-10-23 09:40:16 +0800 <katw423> @GeorgeTakei Me looking at calendar &amp; seeing it's 2020 &amp; we STILL haven't seen #LiarInChief's taxes from when he said in 2016 he'd release them, oh yeah after the "audit" was complete. I think "audit" must've been codeword for tax fraud investigation.
1319451821690163200 2020-10-23 09:33:23 +0800 <katw423> Good god, everything coming out of #MangoMussolini's mouth is lie, well I'm not actually listening, I'm reading subtitles can't stand to hear his voice. I'm not surprised but I wish there was big red LIE that would pop up screen every time he lies. #PresidentialDebate2020
1319442474998386689 2020-10-23 08:56:14 +0800 <katw423> @WalshFreedom @RickSantorum @CNN Why does @CNN allow #Santorum on their network? That's why I don't watch CNN anymore. Too many #Cult45 sycophants that seldom get fact checked or pushed back on their BS.

1319354705777205250 2020-10-23 03:07:28 +0800 <katw423> @bdog_mom @essenviews I didn't see any mention they were removed, unless it was part of "the plan" which they executed. I did notice the armed intimidators, had time to set up tent. Seems cops would've been there before they had time to do so. Also, no mention of if it was removed either.

1318571315142512642 2020-10-20 23:14:34 +0800 <katw423> @kylegriffin1 He didn't want stock market to crash or economy to get trashed. It's all he has to run on. Everything he does is to help him stay in power. #MangoMussolini does NOT care about Americans, our country, our democracy or rule of law. He's dicktor wanna-be in charge of #Kakistocracy

Won't be quick or easy task but we MUST send #trumpism to the dust bin of history.   When you create new Republican party please call it something besides #GOP. That term is toxic.

1317092892964474889 2020-10-16 21:19:50 +0800 <katw423> @tribelaw @jgeltzer Sorry but I don't agree with your statement that DOJ, FBI, &amp; esp special counsel regs has "superstrong" barriers. #Mueller &amp; his report was walked on, FBI is tip-toeing in what it says to Congress &amp; Americans, &amp; #Barr has turned DOJ into personal law firm for #MangoMussolini
1317082559478747137 2020-10-16 20:38:47 +0800 <katw423> @ThePubliusUSA And would've convicted him, removed him from office, unlike this current crop of complicit, enabling GOP coward #Cult45 members.
1317081687495495681 2020-10-16 20:35:19 +0800 <katw423> @MaxBoot @RicPatterson I'm most definitely NOT member of Bernie wing but I've NOT ruled out court expansion.   Why does everyone keep asking #Biden about court packing while letting this #GOP slide about THEIR court packing; not allowing #Obama to appoint judges, refusing to give hearing to Garland?
1317080498456449026 2020-10-16 20:30:35 +0800 <katw423> 2/2 Is that how you treat your children? Is that msg you want to send to your children?   I dunno I'm not parent so maybe I'm wrong but I'd hope I wouldn't give in to my temper tantrum throwing child.   He got exactly what he wanted + whole lot more=distraction &amp; free press.
1317080497416212481 2020-10-16 20:30:35 +0800 <katw423> 1/2 @morningmika @Morning_Joe You're both missing point about my outrage @NBC over townhall. You don't allow #BabytRump to throw hissy fit by refusing to show up for virtual debate then reward him with EXACTLY what he wanted, which was to upstage #BidenTownHall &amp; get free press..
1316976208446410752 2020-10-16 13:36:10 +0800 <katw423> @PatinkinMandy I loved your previous video's but think this one hit new high. It contains very important message while being funny as hell.  It's true, winning POTUS is not enuf, we simply *MUST* #FlipTheSenateBlue    #CreateTheOutcome &amp; help #FlipTheSenate   #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
1316974520478158849 2020-10-16 13:29:28 +0800 <katw423> If you haven't watched or seen Mandy &amp; Kathyrn's video's before, you simply must watch this one.   Not only because the message is so important but it's funny as hell too.   #FlipTheSenateBlue
1316953018592616454 2020-10-16 12:04:02 +0800 <katw423> @RegularResister Calm &amp; hopeful our democracy will survive *if* #Biden becomes our next POTUS. And that regular Americans will benefit from his policies, NOT big business, oil corps &amp; rich 1% donors. I'm still scared #FascistInChief will steal election  PLEASE #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
1316949794640846849 2020-10-16 11:51:13 +0800 <katw423> @KatSNicholson @maddow @Lawrence Well that's good I guess that she pushed back &amp; got him to admit that about his lungs &amp; also sounds like he probably didn't test negative before 1st debate with #Biden &amp; that's why no one will say when his last negative test was.
1316948938818244608 2020-10-16 11:47:49 +0800 <katw423> @carlbernstein THX Carl for speaking truth. I'm disgusted that @nbc capitulated to #45's demands &amp; rewarded his bad behavior when he refused to do virtual debate. I can only hope his rating aren't as good as #BidenTownHallOnABC but fear too many tuned in to watch potential #tRumpTrainwreck
1316946389650333697 2020-10-16 11:37:41 +0800 <katw423> @KatSNicholson @maddow @Lawrence Good for @lawrence. Hearing Rachel's fact checking of #45's event sounds like Guthrie didn't do much real time fact checking or pushing back against conspiracy theories. I could be wrong since I didn't watch it &amp; WON'T. I don't watch his rallies so not giving him my attn now.
1316943536487542785 2020-10-16 11:26:21 +0800 <katw423> Thx YOU @Lawrence saying you'll focus more on #BidenTownhall rather than #TemperTantrumtRump's #NBC rally event.   Still pissed that NBC gave into #45's demands which I'm going to assume only way he agreed do his townhall was for it be to up against #BidenTownhall. Prove me wrong
1316942050865127424 2020-10-16 11:20:27 +0800 <katw423> Sorry @maddow I've had enuf &amp; I'm so disappointed in how much you're talking about #BabytRump. Hoping @lawrence covers more of #BidenTownHall on #LastWord &amp; WAY less of #MangoMussolini's.   Sounds like #45's was just another rally event but given bigger platform for his lies.
1316940615062618113 2020-10-16 11:14:44 +0800 <katw423> So #TemperTantrumtRump's townhall was only hr but he's gotten an additional 40mins+ free press on @maddow show &amp; will probably be all news media talks about for day or 2. So he got what he needed=distraction/deflection &amp; FREE air time. #BidenTownhall gets ZERO media coverage
1316930185053220865 2020-10-16 10:33:18 +0800 <katw423> @LeslieBryant44 @Laurie_Garrett @nbc @JoeBiden @ABC Yep, #BidenTownhall lasted 1.5hr but then he continued after official event ended. TV viewers didn't get to hear what was being said but he was still at it until they cutoff the camera &amp; went to regular programming. He may still be there answering questions. lol He got #STAMINA
1316926563305259009 2020-10-16 10:18:54 +0800 <katw423> @TrumpDefined @nbc The POINT is bad behavior should NOT be rewarded. When #45 had hissy fit &amp; refused virtual debate he should NOT have been given his own townhall, esp on same night as #BidenTownHall. So next debate he'll come up with some crap, back out &amp; get free airtime on HIS terms. BS on that
1316925299599224832 2020-10-16 10:13:53 +0800 <katw423> @realMJSharma @katibug817 It was great #BidenTownHall. Wonder how many actually watched it rather than what I can only assume was sh**show on #NBC. @NBC disgusts me giving in to #BabytRump's temper tantrum of refusing virtual debate.   #Biden was still talking to those who attended after event was over
1316923605830279168 2020-10-16 10:07:09 +0800 <katw423> It ticks me off to see how many people tuned into #TemperTantrumtRump townhall rewarding him for acting like child by refusing to do virtual debate. Giving him ratings he so desires &amp; keeping people from watching #BidenTownHall. So guess bad behavior DOES payoff. Bad messaging
1316921957292609540 2020-10-16 10:00:36 +0800 <katw423> @Tom_Winter @SavannahGuthrie Your job is not to help re-elect fascist racist by giving in to his childish behavior. When #45 refused to do virtual debate he shouldn't get rewarded with own townhall &amp; then scheduled for same night as #Biden's townhall.   @NBC has lost credibility. It's all about $ to you
1316462802371051520 2020-10-15 03:36:05 +0800 <katw423> #Cult45 has some of the best people, NOT!  Ma Terrell sounds like real piece of work. Bet her Mom's proud of that mouth.
1316461948666511362 2020-10-15 03:32:41 +0800 <katw423> @arappeport LOL, I highly doubt #Biden would want ANY of these #Cult45 sycophants to stay on so don't think think #Munchkin has to worry about being asked.
1316461213568692226 2020-10-15 03:29:46 +0800 <katw423> @DanRather I'd like to see these "militia" terrorists aka #VanillaISIS walking around with muskets rather than ak47s.

1316458855157714944 2020-10-15 03:20:24 +0800 <katw423> #BoycottMSNBC for rewarding man-baby #MangoMussolini with townhall after refusing to do virtual debate.   That's NOT how to treat someone having temper tantrum. #DObetter @NBC &amp; @MSNBC. You're complicit in destroying our democracy   #BoycottNBCTownHall  #BoycottNBCAdvertisers
1316456885579546624 2020-10-15 03:12:34 +0800 <katw423> @glennkirschner2 Why is our DOJ allowed to stick it's nose where it doesn't really belong. It's not up to them to bring suit like this, is it?  Shouldn't it be the offended party, in this case Melania's lawyers, filing suit?  Our DOJ is no longer Dept of Justice. It doesn't know what Justice is
1316455609043218432 2020-10-15 03:07:30 +0800 <katw423> I know this is rather old tweet but I'll take some good news any time I can get it.

1316454591572193282 2020-10-15 03:03:27 +0800 <katw423> @DrSeaRotmann @oceanmatterz I don't understand how destructive bottom-trawling can be allowed *anywhere* on #Earth but especially in marine protected areas.   We have same problem with so called "refuges" "protected areas", "sanctuaries" which as names imply SHOULD be protectors of wildlife but aren't.
1316452834125189123 2020-10-15 02:56:28 +0800 <katw423> @theenvirotarian As are we under this #climateDenier prez &amp; republican party. Water protections withdrawn, carbon emissions rolled pack, endangered species protections gone, more drilling being allowed &amp; on &amp; on. All by this current #POSpotus.   At least your system allows Greens to have some say
1316450543783550982 2020-10-15 02:47:22 +0800 <katw423> Amazing video of #orca aka #blackfish
1316450236508901379 2020-10-15 02:46:09 +0800 <katw423> @oceanmatterz WOW! I found it amazing that when swimmer stopped doing backstroke &amp; was no longer looking eye-to-eye or facing mama #orca she swam to front swimmer in order to get that eye contact back. Talk about #Facetime. lol   #EmptyTheTanks  #DontBuyATicket #TaijiEndDolphinHunts
1316448260341534723 2020-10-15 02:38:18 +0800 <katw423> @theenvirotarian I wish we could get our #GOP #ClimateDenying politicians here in USA to be more Green thinking. Hopefully, democrats will win Senate, Prez &amp; retain House majority &amp; maybe then we can start helping our environment before it's too late. #Biden has good plan.
1316444588962443265 2020-10-15 02:23:43 +0800 <katw423> @MSNBC And you are as complicit in destroying our country as #MangoMussolini, his state run #faux news &amp; his #Cult45 enabling #GOP.   I'm so disappointed in you but then you may not have had  choice by @NBC to not show it.   #BoycottNBCTownHall  #BoycottMSNBC #BoycottNBCAdvertisers
1316442239799881728 2020-10-15 02:14:22 +0800 <katw423> @pedroiafan @keithboykin And either @MSNBC is being complicit on their own &amp; forced by their parent company to show this friggin' sham townhall.   I'm going to REALLY miss @maddow, @lastword with @Lawrence, @DeadlineWH with @NicolleDWallace &amp; few other shows but guess I'll be boycotting that network too.

1316434658578567168 2020-10-15 01:44:15 +0800 <katw423> @NBCNews You're exactly like complicit, enabling #GOP. They'll do ANYTHING so they &amp; #MangoMussolini stay in power. Appears you'll do ANYTHING for ratings.   I wish @MSNBC wasn't part of your network, as much as I love @maddow I may have to boycott her 2. #BoycottNBCTownHall  # BoycottNBC
1316432875227680768 2020-10-15 01:37:10 +0800 <katw423> WTF @nbc man-baby #tRump has hissy fit about not doing virtual debate &amp; is being rewarded with his own town hall, on same night as #Biden is having his on ABC. Seems you are trying to help #MangoMussolini get re-elected, anything for ratings, huh? You're as bad #ComplicitGOP

1316403042217066502 2020-10-14 23:38:37 +0800 <katw423> @MikeyNog Yeah, not convinced he ever had #Covid19. I still think he might have faked it like every else this #FakePotus has done or said.  He was able to deflect from all issues like taxes, able to act like #coronavirus is no big deal so he doesn't have to do anything to stop the virus.
1315924499360108544 2020-10-13 15:57:03 +0800 <katw423> @ZayaRose7 @eugenegu Yeah only 4 more yrs to go before that can be done. And not sure any Dem can beat her when former Gov #Bredesen couldn't &amp; was supported by both dems &amp; old style repubs, not these #Cult45 rethugs. Pundits thought he had change of winning but sadly lost big time.
1315915894091063296 2020-10-13 15:22:52 +0800 <katw423> @Specneedsmom4 True but I can avoid pain by not trying to type so much or do other things, like stirring pot of chili as often as I do or holding my cell phone long ( I made a bunch of ph holders so that's not issue as much now) or or or. It's all about priorities, improvising &amp; adjusting.
1315913309665865729 2020-10-13 15:12:36 +0800 <katw423> @amyklobuchar Thx Amy for at least speaking truth so maybe, just maybe an undecided voter hears what you're saying &amp; decides to #VoteBiden  I know there's not much Dems can do to stop this #ScotusSham. Come Nov I hope Senate is Blue in order to stop #MoscowMitch &amp; repugs from stacking courts.
1315912016499036160 2020-10-13 15:07:27 +0800 <katw423> @Specneedsmom4 Sorry to hear about all that. My hand problems seem small in comparison to what you've gone thru.   #Barrett with all those kids should be worried about taking away preexisting conditions since it will effect private insurance also &amp; with that many kids she's going to need it.
1315907002451845121 2020-10-13 14:47:32 +0800 <katw423> @Specneedsmom4 You didn't hear/see me say that, I don't need to have preexisting condition in case #SCOTUS with new un-American justice #Barrett ruling against #ACA &amp; preexisting conditions.   It's not actually Dr diagnosed yet so I have that going for me.
1315904896768638976 2020-10-13 14:39:10 +0800 <katw423> @tonyposnanski @Holly_L_S I'm finally able to qualify for #ACA discount come Nov1st since I didn't make enuf $ before &amp; my state didn't expand Medicaid. Now #SCOTUS may take away #Obamacare 10 days later, leaving me &amp; millions of others without #healthcare.   It's clear #Barrett will vote against #ACA

1315896070870835200 2020-10-13 14:04:06 +0800 <katw423> @GGinCHS @stephengrovesjr Thx for posting pic &amp; reminding #SC voters of recent ruling by #SCOTUS requiring witness signature, AFTER ballots were mailed out. #VoterRights aren't high on their list of rulings favoring our democracy.

1315894372119072769 2020-10-13 13:57:21 +0800 <katw423> Heads up #SC about this recent change in requiring ballot to have witness signature.   #SCOTUS making this decision just wks before election was so very wrong &amp; another sign of how they'll rule on #VoterSuppression &amp; #VotingRights.

1315891214596571137 2020-10-13 13:44:48 +0800 <katw423> @Redistrict I'm heartened to see so many voting in person &amp; thank them for waiting up to 11 hrs to vote.   IMHO #45 denigrating mail-in voting has pushed people to vote in person which I think in most states will be counted on election day unlike mailed-in ballots.
1315888292429279232 2020-10-13 13:33:11 +0800 <katw423> I forgot all about #RobertaMcCain passing away, until I just saw it on @11thHour.

1315884703585652736 2020-10-13 13:18:55 +0800 <katw423> @jaywhyelle CA **MUST** make sure voters can ID official ballot drop boxes. I hope they're doing something to distinguish between real &amp; fake boxes.   And #GOP must pay price for these illegal activity. Someone needs to go to jail over this.

Has anyone in media questioned this &amp; ask again when he last tested negative before his infection. It still matters.

1315045864084209665 2020-10-11 05:45:41 +0800 <katw423> @onelesscase I'm sure there are some people that have use for these cases esp those that might need masks available at different locations. Or have need to have extra available. Or just haven't acquired amount of stuff I have over the years that I can re-purpose.
1315044504781586434 2020-10-11 05:40:16 +0800 <katw423> @onelesscase Oh I know that. I just don't have need for mask storage case, I have plenty of items I can use for that so don't need to buy anything. Not sure why I brought up about making my own masks other than to say I didn't need to spend $ on something I can just make more of, if needed.

I researched &amp; made my own masks &amp; think 1 made from flannel is probably almost as good as N95 but it's a bit hard to breathe thru. 1 too may layers, it's 4 layers thick. My other mask is only 3 ply but has nose piece.

I'm doing my best to stay safe but I live in deep red #trumpistan country so every day I see more going maskless. #Maskholes, like their dear leader, don't care about others, so in grocery store I make point of giving them wide berth when walking by them. They notice.

1312046993401876481 2020-10-02 23:09:14 +0800 <katw423> @MSNBC Too many people with very close contact to #LiarInChief are testing negative for me to believe #45 actually tested positive for #Covid19.

1312043142800171009 2020-10-02 22:53:56 +0800 <katw423> @stengel @DebraDuGemini59 I totally agree with last part, not so much 1st sentence tho. I know that makes me bad person but I just can't seem to bring forth empathy for #MangoMussolini or any of his #Cult45 people.   He doesn't care about 200,000++ people who died because of his inaction &amp; distortions
1312042043976421376 2020-10-02 22:49:34 +0800 <katw423> @RandyBroResist @Memers08 And that is one thing that saddens me, losing my empathy. I hate that this #POSpotus has caused this change in me.    Well in addition to our democracy being destroyed among many other things he's done.
1312040588108279808 2020-10-02 22:43:47 +0800 <katw423> @Jkowalczyk5 I can't find photo right now but I have one bee pic that was so full of white pollen he looked like albino bee. 😀
1312038899183751168 2020-10-02 22:37:04 +0800 <katw423> @Jkowalczyk5 Sorry I meant hornet not bee.
1312038667813376001 2020-10-02 22:36:09 +0800 <katw423> @Jkowalczyk5 Oh great close up photo of bee. It's not easy to get such close up.
1312038140312510464 2020-10-02 22:34:03 +0800 <katw423> @Jkowalczyk5 I have what are either crows, ravens of some type of huge blackbird that I can't really identify lol who visit the birdbath &amp; enjoy the pears, apples that fall from trees in back yard. Don't have magpies where I live though. They're supposed to be super smart birds.
1312036935016341505 2020-10-02 22:29:16 +0800 <katw423> @Jkowalczyk5 Here's in USA raccoons are feared &amp; reviled as they are or can be one of main carriers of rabies, bats being the main carrier, I think I read. I've not witnessed any rabies in those visiting my yard but I'm still cautious around them.

It's illegal but done far offshore so hard to police. Not sure status of these hunts since harpoon was banned.
1312033054005825541 2020-10-02 22:13:51 +0800 <katw423> @Jkowalczyk5 My garden used to have enough flowering plants to sustain huge bee population. Sadly I can no longer keep it up &amp; noticed bees have declined. I might try using jam, though I'm afraid the ants would get it first. Worth a try though. They do need our help.
1312032045246427136 2020-10-02 22:09:50 +0800 <katw423> @Jkowalczyk5 Few of my non-feathered friends   Not the best photo's of these #Raccoon babies napping, #squirrel relaxing &amp; very shy #Groundhog but best I can do shooting thru screendoor.  https://t.co/0A7czqGKzg
1312022250300768258 2020-10-02 21:30:55 +0800 <katw423> @Jkowalczyk5  I not only feed birds, but squirrels, raccoons, chipmunks, possums whatever wants to visit my "bird" feeders. Watching wildlife &amp; experiencing nature is GREAT!

Or skin them while alive. What kind of person can do such thing to innocent animal? What does it take to mentally carry out such cruelty?
1312019255349649410 2020-10-02 21:19:01 +0800 <katw423> @DrGJackBrown @freddyatton It's way too convenient to believe #LiarInChief actually tested positive for #Covid19 esp when so many that have been in close contact with him are testing negative.   This "news" is #OctoberSurprise. meant to distract us from so many of his problems &amp; issues. It's a HOAX
1312017498368364544 2020-10-02 21:12:02 +0800 <katw423> @TheRickWilson Sure sounds like report #LiarInChief tested positive for #COVID19 could be hoax meant to deflect, distract, garner sympathy right before election. THAT is the #OctoberSurprise.   Knocked off headlines ~200,000+ Americans dead coz of #45 ~#WoodwardBook revelations ~#DebateDebacle
1312010432639627264 2020-10-02 20:43:57 +0800 <katw423> @WalshFreedom How can you be so sure #LiarInChief is telling us truth he tested positive for #COVID19. Seems pretty f'ing convenient as distraction &amp; way to deflect from all problems &amp; issues surrounding him.   Esp in light most of those in close contact with him are testing negative
1312006600606060545 2020-10-02 20:28:44 +0800 <katw423> @MysterySolvent I question whether the report that #MangoMussolini tested positive for #covid19 is true.  I wonder if it's not just way to deflect &amp; distract us from all his issues &amp; way to garner sympathy. Esp since so many in close contact with #45 have tested negative.  #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
1312004932594216961 2020-10-02 20:22:06 +0800 <katw423> @WajahatAli Since I do NOT trust #MangoMussolini or anyone in this admin, are we even sure he really tested positive for #covid19 or is this just way to deflect &amp; distract us from all issues surrounding him?  I guess we'll only know for sure if he ends up in hospital.
1312003221704134657 2020-10-02 20:15:18 +0800 <katw423> How do we know #HopeHicks got it 1st? Maybe she got it from someone else in this corrupt admin who tried to hide it as long as possible while spreading #COVID19 Because none in #cult45 care about Americans.  Hope #Biden didn't get infected.
1312000870708637700 2020-10-02 20:05:58 +0800 <katw423> @4everNeverTrump #MangoMussolini knew he was exposed to #covid19 &amp; still CHOSE to expose others.  His admin did not inform Americans of his positive result reporter did  So when it comes to this #POSpotus &amp; complicit enabling #GOP I lost any empathy I had for them. I don't care if how that sounds
1311998061879668737 2020-10-02 19:54:48 +0800 <katw423> @keithedwards Because #MangoMussolini does not care about anyone but himself. He does not care how many people he might have infected. He does not care if they don't have any insurance or good insurance like he does.  #ACA #Obamacare #HealthcareMatters having insurance MATTERS!
1311993865465925633 2020-10-02 19:38:07 +0800 <katw423> Of course rethugs want to create confusion &amp; suppress votes esp so close to election because they are losing. #LeningradLindsey could lose his seat to #JaimeHarrison #GoJaimeGo!  #VoteGOPOut #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica   https://t.co/Us7oV7ca2t

Not just focused on #NarcissistInChief's inability to denounce #WhiteSupremacy   "Any commentary about how awful these 90 minutes were is incomplete if it doesn’t pin all the blame on Trump."
1311321265593036805 2020-09-30 23:05:27 +0800 <katw423> @CassOMalley1 Thank you that may be just the word I'm looking for. Or at least just one of them.
1311320640318853121 2020-09-30 23:02:58 +0800 <katw423> @PatinkinMandy Unfortunately Kathryn it won't just be those who vote for this malignant narcissistic bully that will have to live with it *IF* he is re-elected. It's majority of Americans who value our Constitution, norms, decency, humanity who will have to watch all that is good be eroded.

He acts like he's above the law &amp; allowed to break rules, norms, laws with impunity. Worse, he gets away with it with help from complicit, enabling, hypocritic #GOP &amp; ratings hungry media.
1311311580634722306 2020-09-30 22:26:58 +0800 <katw423> @Mimirocah1 @CassOMalley1 It's depressing to hear undecided voter after watching that sh**show last night saying they are still undecided. What kind of person, what kind of character, what kind of morals or decency does such a person not possess. Is this what humanity has become?
1311308910947598336 2020-09-30 22:16:21 +0800 <katw423> @WalshFreedom You are correct but from what I'm seeing on twitter &amp; hearing on news is they are trying to make it about  "both sides". Our country is so f**ked not sure we'll ever recover.
1311306128857460736 2020-09-30 22:05:18 +0800 <katw423> @McFaul @connieg65014645 Yep, I yelled at TV for either Wallace or Biden to say that but obviously neither could hear me. Good thing I wasn't in the audience since I would've yelled out many things to counter #LiarInChief's lies, gaslighting &amp; deflection.
1311303330879205376 2020-09-30 21:54:11 +0800 <katw423> @PhlexXxStallion @ProjectLincoln Agreed!   I just had to comment to say, I LOVE this "leaning tower of stupid".
1311302675401773058 2020-09-30 21:51:35 +0800 <katw423> #TraitorTrump saying don't ever use that word = smart, with me is so spot on since he's the dumbest MF that ever walked this Earth.
1311299163473272832 2020-09-30 21:37:37 +0800 <katw423> How can any voter still be undecided at this point &amp; esp after watching that sh**show last night.   My god, our country is doomed even if Biden wins because we have far too many people who don't seem to value honesty, ethics, morals or anything good that humanity SHOULD value.
1311289007897276420 2020-09-30 20:57:16 +0800 <katw423> Re: #Debates2020  Seems no one is talking about how much #TraitorTrump denigrated blue states how he only wants to be prez for red states.   We are UNITED STATES &amp; *NEED* prez who will governor for all of us rather than dividing us as #Putin wants.   #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
1311287548183015424 2020-09-30 20:51:28 +0800 <katw423> @bblock29 @sarah_meinzer In a New York minute.   And #TraitorTrump would sell them cheaply too since he is not deal-maker he tries to con people into believing he is.

You've suffered enuf &amp; given more than your share of life to #Covid19 while others have given no one, nothing &amp; have "helped" virus take so many lives by his inaction &amp; downplaying of the virus.

Anyone that's read bible can see it. And it's true real Christians have stayed quiet too long maybe they're aren't as political as evilgelicals.   Just like real republicans let fake republiCONS take over their party.

1306599371325288448 2020-09-17 22:22:20 +0800 <katw423> @ONELONEDOLPHIN Sorry I know I went from talking about human infant self-awareness to dolphin self-awareness &amp; how it's different than just being aware or from intelligence. Many animals are intelligent, not all are self-aware. Not all have a sense of self, that they're individuals.
1306597703548391425 2020-09-17 22:15:42 +0800 <katw423> @ONELONEDOLPHIN Watch video tell me if you think this dolphin committed suicide. Dolphins have to *think* about every breathe they take, it's not automatic like in humans. This one appears to CHOOSE to no longer take that breathe coz he has sense of self, ie self-aware 😭  https://t.co/R5XUCkBbez
1306592203494612992 2020-09-17 21:53:51 +0800 <katw423> @ONELONEDOLPHIN It's why I think dolphins when trapped in #TheCove will sometimes throw themselves on the rocks to what appears to me to be committing suicide. They know their existence, who they are, their life is about to end &amp; want to end it THEIR way on THEIR terms not at hands of murderer.
1306588853348728833 2020-09-17 21:40:32 +0800 <katw423> @ONELONEDOLPHIN Not sure what happened to 1/2 tweet. Sorry for my replies being disjointed &amp; not in proper reply order. Twitter can be pain to keep convo in proper context &amp; relationship esp when I get messed up &amp; reply to wrong tweet.
1306588014580240384 2020-09-17 21:37:12 +0800 <katw423> @amandacarpenter I agree #Barr needs to be impeached even tho Senate wouldn't convict or remove him either he'd still have that mark to take into history forever.   #ImpeachBarr  #ImpeachTrumpAgain
1306587235735625734 2020-09-17 21:34:06 +0800 <katw423> @B52Malmet Blatant vote buying like 3rd world dictators do to get re-elected in rigged elections.   Same as when #LiarInChief talked about passing tax cut bill 3 wks before 2018 mid-term elections trying to help repubs get elected. #VoteBuying
1306586415283793923 2020-09-17 21:30:51 +0800 <katw423> @ONELONEDOLPHIN Tho I knew this sounds awful but put 6 month old human child in front of firing squad would she knew she's about to be shot &amp; killed? Would she even be fearful? Highly doubtful. She hasn't developed that sense of self yet to recognize her own impeding death or what is happening.
1306584185050726400 2020-09-17 21:21:59 +0800 <katw423> @tedlieu @BrianKarem @TheJusticeDept It's become obvious #Barr &amp; most republicans don't care about oath they took to Constitution, to America or Americans. They were just words recited when taking office with no meaning to them. They have no honor.   #VoteOutEveryRepublican  #VoteGOPOut
1306582994245816321 2020-09-17 21:17:15 +0800 <katw423> @ONELONEDOLPHIN 2/2 Much like humans were when Twin Towers were on fire, about to fall. Most knew they were about to die &amp; could be why some choose to jump rather than suffer burning alive. Being self-aware, they chose own fate rather than have it imposed upon them. Possible act of defiance??
1306581447592083458 2020-09-17 21:11:06 +0800 <katw423> @ONELONEDOLPHIN 1/2 Most of what I've learned about self-awareness has been about dolphins, so when Taiji has pod of dolphins in #TheCove &amp; start killing them, they probably know they are about to die. They are aware of themselves, their pod mates &amp; their fate. The have a sense of self.
1306578993768955914 2020-09-17 21:01:21 +0800 <katw423> @ONELONEDOLPHIN Or read Dr Lori Marino's paper on dolphin cognition (self-recognition, self-awareness).  https://t.co/FYhCFrdFVW  Or, tho I know it's long, watch her video to get better idea of what I'm talking about when referring to self-awareness:  https://t.co/Z5kjEpwwKZ

My dog could tell diff 'tween me, mom or even stranger but put him in front of mirror &amp; he thought he was looking at another dog NOT himself. Read about mirror test, testing self-awareness

1305565173277745152 2020-09-15 01:52:48 +0800 <katw423> @skinutonwater21 Wish I could.   I just hope #MangoMussolini's day in court will come once he's out of office.  It's #Cult45 mentality. They only believe what their cult leader tells them. They'll drink the koolaid when he tells them 2, well actually attending rallies is form of drinking koolaid

Damn this is America where we're supposed to have rights that allow us the right to video newsworthy or any event we want. I'm tired of seeing police trying to infringe on that right
1305490544106369027 2020-09-14 20:56:15 +0800 <katw423> @donwinslow I don't care if this was from 2014 or yesterday. This type of brutality needs to be called out EVERY time. I wish we had more recent update than 2017 esp about status of lawsuit since it's obvious no cops will be charged with anything.    https://t.co/0aFuEI8jqj
1305487497514954753 2020-09-14 20:44:08 +0800 <katw423> @DeepStateShu Yes   Instead we get #Cult45 trying to commit violence against those who denounce #MangoMussolini or those he disparages.
1305485708191248385 2020-09-14 20:37:02 +0800 <katw423> @JoeNBC @WSJopinion I'm also going to say I support #BlackLivesMatter &amp; denounce police brutality against blacks &amp; know it's big problem that we white people with our #WhitePrivilege  couldn't quite understand tho we are starting to get it.   I can do both denounce police brutality &amp; police killing
1305483852211785728 2020-09-14 20:29:39 +0800 <katw423> @JoeNBC @WSJopinion After scanning comments in this thread this is BS &amp; wasn't a protest, I'm just going to say, even 1 person supporting cowardly ambush shooter &amp; wishing officers die is one too many.   Around my area if we get 5 people gather together for #BlackLivesMatter it's called a protest.
1305478935766073346 2020-09-14 20:10:07 +0800 <katw423> @ONELONEDOLPHIN Sorry we'll have to agree to disagree on this since I trust science &amp; research over personal experience &amp; anecdotal "evidence".

1304483840518430721 2020-09-12 02:15:58 +0800 <katw423> @jaketapper A good portion of those were murdered by #MangoMussolini IMHO. He not only lied to us &amp; downplayed #coronavirus seriousness, he spread misinformation about it &amp; did about everything he could to help the virus. Many more lives were lost because of him &amp; his lack of humanity.

He IMHO committed genocide against Americans.
