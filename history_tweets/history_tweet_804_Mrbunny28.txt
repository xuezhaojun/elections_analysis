1343571963441197056 2020-12-28 22:58:13 +0800 <Mrbunny28> @MigrationWatch Good grief do you ever look at the sort of folk who “like” your tweets?
1343571513421783041 2020-12-28 22:56:25 +0800 <Mrbunny28> @MigrationWatch Because control means the ability to act on the the basis of best evidence?

1342935418501795841 2020-12-27 04:48:48 +0800 <Mrbunny28> @GoodwinMJ As usual “controlling immigration” is seen as important by you. Why not change it to “controlling movement”. Doesn’t sound so good does it? Wonder why?
1342884427932831745 2020-12-27 01:26:11 +0800 <Mrbunny28> @daveo99 @GoodwinMJ Nicely put.
1342800217347944449 2020-12-26 19:51:34 +0800 <Mrbunny28> Wonderful: The UK has tied its self to global standards to avoid having to be seen to having bi lateral agreements with the EU. Globalisation ha ha: Marx is right again!   https://t.co/QVY51UHLub

1340596644618842113 2020-12-20 17:55:21 +0800 <Mrbunny28> @mcelhearn @IanDunt The public especially us old pensioners up north still call him “Boris” and think we could have a laugh and a pint with him. We are culpable. And yet @GoodwinMJ gives us a free pass because we with our baby boomer pensions are in some unbelievable way “left behind”.

1338098203351281665 2020-12-13 20:27:26 +0800 <Mrbunny28> @GoodwinMJ You have a story about us and then ask the questions that illicit the “facts” that support it.

1338096440657272832 2020-12-13 20:20:26 +0800 <Mrbunny28> @crockpics The only hope lay on Brentford Road and Orange Street
1338096089799536641 2020-12-13 20:19:03 +0800 <Mrbunny28> @crockpics Then beginning of the end of the golden era of progressive pop. Now every young kid in Britain wants to squeal endless guitar solos over 12 bar blues. Syd had written all his songs. The Beatles were creating their first parody album. The Beach Boys were becoming cabaret artists.

1319942697935917056 2020-10-24 18:03:57 +0800 <Mrbunny28> @GoodwinMJ Keep up the “primacy of the nation” narrative. It might become true if you try hard enough.

The Soviet Union did it by other means ( not better). It has destroyed borders even as the ruling classes use nationalism/racism to maintain its hegemony. It will lead to the ascendency of the international worker.

Alternatively provide loads of your thing free so that you can’t sell your thing. Eg only a few people pay to see a doctor now that medicine is socialised

Serves the interests of capitalism to try and divide the working class by nationality/race/gender. “No borders” is the starting point of uniting the global working class.
