In light of title IX, which encourages false rape accusations against ethnic male minorities, we can expect this inequality to become even worse.

If course there was some fraud. The only question is how much.  For example, we know thousands of people voted in two different states.

1340883704336543749 2020-12-21 12:56:02 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @JohnJ0Donnell @nytimes Actually it makes sense. Multiple judges and lawyers have had their physical safety threatened by anarchists.  My bet is that the full extent of the fraud will come out afterwards just as it happened with Mexico in 1988.  But it's prima facie fraud to an objective observer.

1340876840869765121 2020-12-21 12:28:45 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @BadHombreMarcoB @nytimes This is very similar to the ballot envelopes destroyed in Pennsylvania. Also in every voting machine in which an audit has been done, they have found that all user logs were deleted and purged, even though 2016 and 2018 data still existed.  Destroying evidence is proof of guilt.

1340876105826365442 2020-12-21 12:25:50 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @BadHombreMarcoB @nytimes Which is why the Mexican President has declined to congratulate Biden yet. He knows exactly what a stolen election looks like-  it looks like this one.

1340874500011864066 2020-12-21 12:19:27 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @JohnJ0Donnell @nytimes Well the explantion doesn't add up. The other batches of votes from the same precincts were different. The massive spikes for Biden happened late after Republican observors were kicked out.  https://t.co/ctQCZxcjbG
1340874151746293760 2020-12-21 12:18:04 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @BadHombreMarcoB @nytimes Incidentally, Trump received a large share of black votes than any Republican since 1960. He also received unprecedented support from the Hispanic community.   If it weren't for untraceable mail-in ballots and voter machine fraud, he would have won.     https://t.co/TyGu45xdO5

They also stopped the vote count in Mexico 1988 and that turned out to be fraud.   History will not be kind to this election.  Mass absentee ballots exponentially increased fraud.

1340872973721473026 2020-12-21 12:13:23 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @nytimes Has there been any explanation yet as to why the vote counting stopped late at night and then suddenly there were large anomalous vote dumps almost all for Biden in four states?  Like, we've never stopped counting votes on election night. Isn't that prima facie suspicious?

1340867952581685249 2020-12-21 11:53:26 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @0xdemosthenes @NewYorker I believe the eyewitness testimony which is evidence of nontransparency by force. However since many have dehumanized their political opponents, they immediately write off the fact that white male pollwatchers were racially targeted and kicked out without being replaced.

It's true that in Philadelphia, the case was arguing the equal protection clause and NOT fraud.   That doesn't mean there isn't fraud, it merely means that fraud wasn't their argument.   But keep drinking the kool aid and you support big gov.

1340142864530075650 2020-12-19 11:52:12 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @athie_gnome @proteinwisdom As for politifact. Richard Baris gave them sources for dead voters who had requested ballots in Michigan and the next days those records were scrubbed.  I acknowledge that the establishment has a well oiled propaganda machine that is anti-Trump. But who checks the factcheckers?
1340142288941539331 2020-12-19 11:49:54 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @athie_gnome @proteinwisdom Do you have evidence that the signatures were checked?  We have to take the Democrats word for it in counties like Fulton because there was no meaningful bipartisan observation. Same in Philadelphia and Detroit.
1340142042949795844 2020-12-19 11:48:56 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @athie_gnome @proteinwisdom You realize that the 2016 Clinton email leaks revealed that the AP published articles under direct supervision of the Democrat party?  Essentially you just sent me Democratic Party propaganda.

1340133059681775618 2020-12-19 11:13:14 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @SecretaryHobbs It is the responsibility of government to demonstrate the security of our elections.  The easiest way to do that is to allow a full audit of Dominion voting machines and their user logs.  If we find they were deleted, spoiliation of data is evidence of malfeasance
1340132201086791689 2020-12-19 11:09:49 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @athie_gnome @proteinwisdom Meanwhile, the Democrats have kept the Green Party off the ballot by having a very high and strict standard for signature matched.  But in the general election, they didn't even check signature matches.

1340068142488367105 2020-12-19 06:55:17 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @TheReactionGif @ScottAdamsSays Democrats kick out Republican  observors and continue counting at the same time they drop an anomalous dump of Biden only votes.  And then they want the people they kicked out and blocked windows against to prove they cheated.  That's easy. Nontransparency by force. That's proof.

These same Democrats boarded up windows so Republicans couldn't see what was happening.  These same Democrats enforced nontransparency by force are now demanding evidence from the very people they evicted
1340043012630523906 2020-12-19 05:15:25 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @athie_gnome @proteinwisdom This coincides with a ballot rejection rate orders of magnitude less than the average.
1340042680760463361 2020-12-19 05:14:06 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @athie_gnome @proteinwisdom I listened to witnesses who signed the affidavits and they said Republicans were racially profiled and removed with violence.  One witness said the rules only applied when she wore a Republican badge. When she switched to a "nonpartisan" badge the rules no longer applied.
1340042311904931841 2020-12-19 05:12:38 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @athie_gnome @proteinwisdom So...  Because some observers skipped a non mandatory walk through session, that means nontransparency by violence is excusable in a democratic process?  Furthermore, witnesses said that Republican observers were racially profiled when being removed with violence.
1340040213209485312 2020-12-19 05:04:18 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @athie_gnome @proteinwisdom Citation?  You can't kick out Republicans who pointed out fraud on the one hand and then demand evidence for fraud from the same observors you kicked out.  Nontransparency by force is inherently antidemocratic. Fascist even.  https://t.co/ExBsnAo4Ay

Seems a disingenuous twisting since it's true in PA the lawyers took a different tack and the case was "equal protection." So in that case fraud was not alleged.

That is why the spike in Fulton country and other counties are so anamolous. They don't match other batches from that same county that had already been counted.   More like 70/30%

1339392404059803651 2020-12-17 10:10:08 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @business Just so long as no one is forced to take the vaccine against their will.
1339391601861419013 2020-12-17 10:06:57 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 Because for obvious reasons, the courts don't want to interfere in a federal election.
1339391053300965376 2020-12-17 10:04:46 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 So again, no actual evidence was ever examined.
1339390870349615110 2020-12-17 10:04:02 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 “The courts have not decided the facts,” Paul said Wednesday during a hearing on the integrity of the 2020 election. “The courts never looked at the facts. The courts don’t like elections, and they stayed out of it by finding an excuse.”
1339389940413677568 2020-12-17 10:00:21 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 I've already pointed out that the Trump team only has 5 cases and they are currently active. Why do you keep distorting the facts?
1339389725749239808 2020-12-17 09:59:29 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 No case has yet been dismissed on merit, but on standing, or due to the severity of injunctive relief being asked. But not one has been dismissed on merit, not has a single court heard testimony from any eyewitness listed in the affidavits.
1339389181508939781 2020-12-17 09:57:20 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 It was filed. They have not been substantiated in court yet.   The Trump team has only filed 5 cases.
1339388972045373441 2020-12-17 09:56:30 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 There's evidence. I can tell you haven't watched the hearings.   As soon as a court judges a case based on its merits, we will get some traction.
1339388643216158724 2020-12-17 09:55:11 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 Sworn witness testimony is evidence.  Video is evidence.   Statistical anomalies are evidence.  IF they confirm one another, that is strong evidence.
1339388413410160641 2020-12-17 09:54:17 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 No court has yet dismissed a case on merit.
1339388196686315520 2020-12-17 09:53:25 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 No that only happened in Pennsylvania because they tried a different tack. They argued in that case that Republican voters were treated differently.   In republican strongholds, ID's were required and signature matches were done. But not in Democrat strongholds in the same state.
1339387912757121026 2020-12-17 09:52:17 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @JordyFuchs @nevrsalty You mean a humble man?

1339387467741446144 2020-12-17 09:50:31 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 The counter argument is that not a single court has yet examined the merits of the case.  When that happens, I think the evidence will translate into proof quite quickly.   Remember- the legislative hearings have the authority to establish evidence.
1339386972566151170 2020-12-17 09:48:33 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @JoyKWilliamson @glukianoff @Popehat @TheFIREorg So killing people with speech is okay when people you agree with do it?
1339386502288183296 2020-12-17 09:46:41 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 That's a good argument. You're saying if there was evidence of fraud then the courts would handle it.   But that's your only one.   You don't actually have an argument against the evidence. So what happens if a court does find fraud? Will you change your mind?
1339386111777452035 2020-12-17 09:45:08 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @PersistentOne3 @KlasfeldReports @BrendanKeefe @RandPaul That's true for Pennsylvatia where the argument was one of unequal treatment.   Republican counties required signature match and ID's. Democrat counties did NOT.   Unequal treatment before the law. That was their argument and didn't touch on fraud.
1339385218243964932 2020-12-17 09:41:35 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 Don't need it. If they were connected to the internet that's enough to invalidate those tallies.
1339384948474703874 2020-12-17 09:40:30 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @TheHinduDindu No problem- we can just keep making up new insults. It's kinda fun!
1339384753884160000 2020-12-17 09:39:44 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 No. Krebs merely confirmed the voting machines were connected to the internet.  Unfortunately, from the single machine audit they have done, while the logs from 2016 and 2018 still exist, the user logs from 2020 are completely wiped.   That's a big no no.
1339383832097787904 2020-12-17 09:36:04 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 "Cyber Security Chris Krebs told the US Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday that some Dominion Voting Machines were connected to the internet."   https://t.co/RYR5E61Ras

1339382275646091274 2020-12-17 09:29:53 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 Um, no, if the machines were connected to the internet that was in violation of the law and election regulations.   It means we need a revote.
1339381012766355457 2020-12-17 09:24:52 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @beyouonlybetter Nope I would climb the fence and examine the signatures as is my job. If they tried to force me out I would go down swinging.   This is war.
1339380293938126848 2020-12-17 09:22:01 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @jsolomonReports @AK4WA Where is a single Democrat with integrity to come forward and acknowledge the facts on the ground?  Yes it would probably cost them their career. But it's always worthwhile to stand up for the truth in a congress of lies.

1339379827758026759 2020-12-17 09:20:10 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @americanshomer @LOLwU2 "...the reporting that President Trump is making "baseless" claims of vote fraud, despite "eyewitness affidavits, vote count anomalies, abrogations of both the Constitution and states' election laws, and the use of Dominion voting machines... have the capacity to flip votes."
1339379293231706112 2020-12-17 09:18:02 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @americanshomer @LOLwU2 Yes. This is exactly how I feel. I live in a despotism, not a republic.

1339377725543489537 2020-12-17 09:11:48 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @lotta_niko At a guess, I would say that money had a large part of it.   If you can afford a good lawyer you can get off.
1339376616624058368 2020-12-17 09:07:24 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @cb_gobsmack Wait until the USA balkanizes.
1339376399577169922 2020-12-17 09:06:32 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @caroljsroth Nope. It was "Joe Biden won the election."
1339376316982898689 2020-12-17 09:06:13 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @KyleKashuv If you are an A list actor you are still allowed.
1339376087621627905 2020-12-17 09:05:18 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @epigwhisp I watched a video in which Bill Gates briefed Pentagon officials about infecting Middle-easterners with a virus to change their DNA in order to make them less "fanatical."  This guy is like the craziest conspiracy theory you've ever dreamed of, except true.
1339374600531140609 2020-12-17 08:59:23 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @SexCounseling @QAnon2Q2Q There are 6 contentious states and in 3, smoking gun evidence for fraud large enough to overturn the election.  In each case, the argument against it is... well it wouldn't change the election anyways.   Except it would. One by one. Georgia, Michigan, Nevada are no-brainers.
1339373329745141766 2020-12-17 08:54:20 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Cernovich The case againt Pornhub is well-funded by Xvideos which owns over 80% of the porn industry. It's as simple as business.
1339355122170773504 2020-12-17 07:41:59 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @mtracey He still would have lost because of election fraud
1339354616039915522 2020-12-17 07:39:59 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @sullydish It gets more complicated because there's widespread evidence of election fraud, duelling electors, and 75 million Americans who believe he won.
1339353965411135489 2020-12-17 07:37:24 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @jonathanchait To complicate things. There's widespread evidence of election fraud.  For example, the vote machines were connected to the internet on election night.
1339353593099509762 2020-12-17 07:35:55 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @TyrannyCounter @jonathanchait There are dueling electors.

Tens of thousands of votes were mass adjudicated without bipartisan oversight?  Also, they were connected to the internet in contravention of election regulation and basic commsense.  Senators Warren and Klobuchar warned us.
1339327922075799556 2020-12-17 05:53:54 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @thehill Let me guess... these polls are from the same team that said Biden was going to win Ohio by 5%?

1339322480822005762 2020-12-17 05:32:17 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CottoGottfried The only possible compromise would be re-election without voting machines.

1339154573827715073 2020-12-16 18:25:05 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @HPluckrose Victimhood culture exists in large part because big government incentivizes victimhood with large amounts of cash.  Feminists cracked the code in the 80s and the rest of social justice followed suit.  It behooves you and your identity group to be portrayed as victims.

This creates a smoke screen of plausibale deniability.  Since the final ballot has no signature and no verification it creates the perfect storm for massive fraud.

I remember reading that Senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klochubar also spoke up about a growing concern that Dominions voting software "switched votes."   Today we learned that they were right. It was discovered in Antrim country, MI.

1338702947815976960 2020-12-15 12:30:29 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Okay it's dishonest to think that 40 unrelated individual plaintiffs would have access to the same evidence.  That's not a real argument.
1338702584044023808 2020-12-15 12:29:02 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper 45 days is extremely fast for a trial. Compound that to massive political pressure...   One judge said he was worried about rioting.  Chief Justice Roberts:  "Are you going to be responsible for the rioting if we hear this case??"
1338701769715687424 2020-12-15 12:25:48 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Maybe they did. I agree we should audit every state. The truth cuts both ways.
1338701647170723847 2020-12-15 12:25:19 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I would say the courts more or less work most of the time if they are given enough time and no political pressure.
1338701348687269892 2020-12-15 12:24:08 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Either it was not shown to a judge   or  it failed miserably.  Can't be both.

1338700686729633793 2020-12-15 12:21:30 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Did they count those ballots without meaningful bipartisan observation?
1338700519204921345 2020-12-15 12:20:50 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I understand that fact. It's also against the law to trick Republicans and press into leaving and to continue counting without bipartisan observation.  Do you understand why?
1338699848619610114 2020-12-15 12:18:10 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @jessesingal I don't remember that from DS9
1338699629806948354 2020-12-15 12:17:18 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper And all despite big tech censorship and MSM narrative painting.
1338698460166565896 2020-12-15 12:12:39 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I saw it with my own eyes. Just like Mexico 1988... they stopped the vote count when Trump was about to win in unprecedented move.  Then four dubious vote dumps in four states in the wee hours. This is how election fraud is done.  And then evidence poured verifying exactly that.
1338696599904657413 2020-12-15 12:05:15 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper The same process of election fraud.  If they get away with it... why wouldn't they do it again?
1338695468440825858 2020-12-15 12:00:46 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper My number one concern is making sure this never happens again.
1338695415433146371 2020-12-15 12:00:33 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Legislative hearings have the authority to establish evidence.   But again, I think it needs to be heard in court. I think given time and a political transition, that it will.
1338694416702304256 2020-12-15 11:56:35 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper  https://t.co/CK28RxTD1T
1338693537492312064 2020-12-15 11:53:05 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Because it might overturn a federal election?  I wouldn't blame a judge for kicking the can on this one. I think there will be a much better shot after the next president is installed, whoever that ends up being.
1338693178128539653 2020-12-15 11:51:40 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper They did. The court filing mentions the state Farm Arena video recording by name.
1338692982736891904 2020-12-15 11:50:53 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper The last proven major voting fraud happened in 1960.   But there were indictments of a judge for voter fraud in Philadelphia in 2019.   There was fraud discovered in Detroit in 2018.   Everyone knows Democrats cheat their primary.
1338692567588888583 2020-12-15 11:49:14 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Sure, it hasn't been proven in court, yet. But video evidence is video evidence. You can look for yourself.
1338692373900107776 2020-12-15 11:48:28 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper So, if at a later date in time, a court rules that election fraud had taken place, would you believe that to be true?
1338692132543016962 2020-12-15 11:47:30 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper For the sake of argument, let's assume there was no fraud. The fact that they counted ballots unobserved is by itself enough reason to throw out the entire batch.
1338691969380474880 2020-12-15 11:46:51 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper But if they counted those ballots unobserved after telling Republicans they were stopping... do you really not see the problem?
1338691816342900738 2020-12-15 11:46:15 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Some have ruled favorably, others less so. Again 45 days is an eyeblink in justice system time.   I am willing to wait for even more evidence to come out, are you?
1338691344777285632 2020-12-15 11:44:22 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper So you will only believe evidence that is proven in court unless it behooves you to believe evidence that is not proven in court?
1338691007689465856 2020-12-15 11:43:02 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Except there's video evidence that they were counting after office closed. That's the facts.
1338690888680222722 2020-12-15 11:42:34 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Mueller's investigation wasn't proven in court. But you believed that.
1338690650506715136 2020-12-15 11:41:37 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper IT's easy to understand why many judges would be reticent to make a ruling that could upset a presidential election. I think the judges will be much more amenable after power transfer.   My main concern is making sure this doesn't happen again.
1338690261069815809 2020-12-15 11:40:04 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Okay.  Fact 1: Affidavits of press and observors being told they were stopping.  Fact 2: They immediately resume counting after the Republicans leave.  Fact 3: The data records a huge anomolous spike for Biden during this unobserved, (except by camera,) time period.  https://t.co/8Zv0aF6Ho2
1338689687679078400 2020-12-15 11:37:47 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I believe that it will come before a judge and that the truth will come out but that 45 days is much too short a time for that.   But the truth always bats last.
1338689367146106883 2020-12-15 11:36:31 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper That's the truth, unless you are saying those eyewitnesses are liars. Watch them. Watch the video I provided. If you still believe they are liars then we can agree to disagree.
1338689074954121216 2020-12-15 11:35:21 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Like I don't see how you can believe this is transparent of the observors were force to use binoculars? That's insanity.  https://t.co/IBf1Sp3qkF
1338688921660760064 2020-12-15 11:34:45 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper So they kicked out all the Republican observers in an unprecedented move and we are supposed to just trust them?  And the few observors who remained said that fraud occurred.   That's evidence.
1338688458651471873 2020-12-15 11:32:54 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I don't have a problem with anybody. I have already seen the evidence. And I haven't even talked about dead people voting, people double voting, people who voted but say they didn't. People who tried to vote but were told they already did.   Ignoring it doesnt make it go away.
1338687984309317634 2020-12-15 11:31:01 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper However, in Fulton we can establish that counting happened after observors were tricked into leaving. And the votes they processed in that time is enough to overturn the election in that state.
1338687824321794049 2020-12-15 11:30:23 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper It's a poker player/dealer who asks to take a break and that you should go get lunch. When you come back he has dealt four aces.   If you protest that it's unfair, he says prove that he cheated.  You can't.
1338687657346523136 2020-12-15 11:29:43 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I have shown clear evidence that fraud occurred. We don't even necessarily need to establish fraud. Once we have non trasnparency of the election by force or fraud, we don't need to prove the fraud for that action alone to invalidate the election integrity.
1338687277564882948 2020-12-15 11:28:13 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Means, motive, and opportunity, with affidavits and video footage.
1338687096115113985 2020-12-15 11:27:29 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper No. I have established evidence of fraud.  In Fulton,  Observors were tricked into leaving. Counting resumed (illegally,) after they left. This coincides with a spike for Biden.   All of this is based on straightforward. evidence.
1338686803302363136 2020-12-15 11:26:20 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper you have made arguments but you haven't given proof. Your main argument is that they have not yet had success in court after only 45 days. That's not very strong.   You have not looked at my evidence-based argument that fraud occurred.
1338686550293565441 2020-12-15 11:25:19 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper You are mindreading again. You should learn to avoid doing that.
1338686401915785217 2020-12-15 11:24:44 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RenyTay Not yet. But I am reading about the controversy surrounding it. It seems to have been controversial at the time. But you are right, there was some who supported his ideas.
1338685673470128128 2020-12-15 11:21:50 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Furthermore, I am keenly, first and foremost a seeker of truth.   I want to know the truth.
1338685455924154368 2020-12-15 11:20:58 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper You are saying that it failed on merits but it's my understanding that they have failed on standing.   Against this is 45 days since it happened, warp speed for courts.
1338685232808124416 2020-12-15 11:20:05 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RenyTay What I found regarding Clarke's book, “Sex in Education”  "Vassar’s professor of astronomy, Maria Mitchell, considered such claims preposterous. As America’s most prominent female scientist — she had gained renown for discovering a comet, which earned her a gold medal."
1338684426365100033 2020-12-15 11:16:53 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Fact 1: Republicans and press were told counting in Fulton country stopped.  Fact 2: Video evidence shows counting resume as soon as observors left.   Fact 3: During this unobserved time preiod, a massive, anomolous batch of votes were processed that flipped the state.  https://t.co/xuIK1EQiMV
1338683950487777285 2020-12-15 11:14:59 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper For now. But this is an extremely short time line for a court to process this much evidence.  But eventually the truth will out.
1338683803573882880 2020-12-15 11:14:24 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper No. There's fraud in every election. Absentee ballots are the worst for fraud but previously made up only 1% of the total so it was no big deal.   There's a reason mass absentee ballots without voter ID is not used in most countries. It's too easy to commit fraud.
1338683464879583233 2020-12-15 11:13:04 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I make up my own mind.   There's a reason Europe has banned mass mail in ballots without voter ID.   That reason is fraud.   There's means, motive, and opportunity.
1338683219470848000 2020-12-15 11:12:05 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper There is evidence in Fulton country and in Wayne county.   This is the problem with the unprecedented use of mass mail in ballots without voter ID. It's the easiest thing in the world to commit fraud in large urban areas with giant inactive voter rolls.
1338682935671746561 2020-12-15 11:10:58 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper And again, I don't even like Trump, and I certainly don't trust him. But anyone who looks at this election objectively, including U.N. elections supervisors, would concluded that there was fraud.
1338682695426183171 2020-12-15 11:10:00 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper What's the lie?
1338682619450494982 2020-12-15 11:09:42 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I have seen evidence of it. It does exist. I have listened to the eyewitnesses. I have looked at the facts as best I understand them.   There's clear evidence of election fraud.
1338682293330845698 2020-12-15 11:08:24 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Would you cheat in an election against someone you believed to be Hitler?
1338682185717518338 2020-12-15 11:07:59 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper The Democrats seemed to have decided that no price is too great to pay to ouster Trump, even if it means cheating at elections by obtaining non transparency by force, (PA, MI,) or by deception (GA, AZ, NV, WI)
1338681920419483651 2020-12-15 11:06:55 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper They made their case in Georgia. It's clear cut. They tricked observors into leaving and then counted ballots without observation netting tens of thousands of votes in one anomolous batch.
1338681598661828612 2020-12-15 11:05:39 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I am not blaming the court. I am being realistic. The truth always bats last.   I cannot believe the party of #believewomen is now telling me that eyewitness testimony is not evidence.
1338681362979696642 2020-12-15 11:04:43 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper You argument seems to be...  Donald Trump said it therefore it must be false.   I don't even like Trump, and I don't trust him. But I trust my own gut when they paused the count on election night. I trust the eyewitnesses who corroborated fraud. I trust the math and the techs.
1338680891963531266 2020-12-15 11:02:50 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Take Trump out of the picture. I am concerned about the truth and about election integrity and don't care as much as the immediate power struggle.   In Michigan they have established the machines were connected to the internet which is against election regulations.
1338680596785225736 2020-12-15 11:01:40 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper They did file this in the court. But obviously Trump's lawyers are on a tight timeline.  I am not concerned if Trump loses. I am concerned about the integrity of the elections. If it happens one time, too bad. If we do not change the election process we have a problem.
1338680024560496641 2020-12-15 10:59:23 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper No I think it's just too slow.   In time the truth will out.   But understandably no judge wants to interfere in an election, not even SCOTUS.   But I am more interested in the truth than justice.
1338679729533181952 2020-12-15 10:58:13 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper A few have been. One judge said it was a strong case before it moved up to the next level. In Wisconsin they just ruled that the state errored in giving a blanket confinement status to everytoe even those who didn't request it.  ' Courts move slowly. In time, truth will out.
1338679318562607104 2020-12-15 10:56:35 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Not on merits. On standing.
1338679265194352640 2020-12-15 10:56:22 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Michigan also had fraud and eyewitnesses watching ballot boxes being brought in unauthorized containers without change of custody and republicans being kicked out.
1338679084126269440 2020-12-15 10:55:39 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper However in Georgia, they showed clear evidence of fraud.   Fulton country told republicans and the media that they stopped counting for the night. After everyone left they continued counting ballots. This coincides exactly with an anomalous spike.  https://t.co/Jrmr6HfjO0
1338678744702128134 2020-12-15 10:54:18 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper That was in Pennsylvania because they tried a different tack which was this- Rural, republican counties had different standards of voting requirements than Democrat counties.   Republicans did signature matches. Democrats did not do signature matches. Their argument was that.
1338677443725582336 2020-12-15 10:49:08 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper And the 50+ is a number thrown around but you realize any private citizen can file a suit over election fraud. Over 40 of those 50 have nothing to do with Trump or his team.
1338677251500630016 2020-12-15 10:48:22 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Um... they did file that in court. As did Sidney Powell. However the legislative branch also has the ability to do factfinding... hence the hearings because the courts are generally slow.
1338676203188838400 2020-12-15 10:44:12 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper That woman I shared went and made an affidavit herself on November 4th because she was so upset by what she had witnessed.   Totally unconnected to Guliani. On her own. As did many other witnesses because they were so upset by what happened. Democrats changed the rules.
1338675900301406208 2020-12-15 10:43:00 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I am skeptical of rudy. But I believe the eyewitnesses. They are very credible. Have you listened to them? Not all are highly credible but some are.  And stopping the vote count on election night in multiple states is a  red flag for fraud.
1338675641466621955 2020-12-15 10:41:58 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Thousands of Affidavits, hundreds of hours of video evidence. Statistical analysis. Evidence that the voting machines were connected to the internet.
1338675464789962755 2020-12-15 10:41:16 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper She signed an affidavit. I believe her.
1338675027856732160 2020-12-15 10:39:32 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I don't know of a single court yet that has heard a single witness.
1338674876241076224 2020-12-15 10:38:56 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I'd say that normally it takes years for a court case like this. Isn't any wonder there is hestiance on the part of the judges?
1338674673513623553 2020-12-15 10:38:08 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I find the witnesses highly credible. And they are corroborated by video evidence.   What is a claim made that is a clear lie?   https://t.co/DpJROK9qmJ
1338674266330583041 2020-12-15 10:36:31 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper So then why do you want to prosecute him afterwards?  Seems like double jeopardy.
1338673987262537728 2020-12-15 10:35:24 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper 1. They have presented evidence. Lots of it.  2. By the same logic, why did MLK JR lose so many court cases?
1338673792198074368 2020-12-15 10:34:38 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper They have presented evidence to the courts and the courts have either ruled they don't want to turn over an election, or they don't have standing.   No one has looked into the evidence. But I believe the eyewitnesses. I believe the video evidence, and I believe the statistics.
1338673490803777536 2020-12-15 10:33:26 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I am skeptical. There was not enough evidence found to move forward on collusion.   I can believe that there was run of the mill billionaire corruption no better or worse than the Biden family.
1338673152763817985 2020-12-15 10:32:05 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Okay, not enough evidence to prove collusion or even make a strong suggestive statement about collusion.
1338672762240577536 2020-12-15 10:30:32 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper If you haven't seen evidence of election fraud then you aren't looking.    A more reasonable argument would claim that it wasn't enough to overturn the election.
1338672557139046400 2020-12-15 10:29:43 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper That's the problem. You think CNN is a good source of information when they have lied to you repeatedly, just as brazenly as Fox.   The difference is that I am skeptical of both. And you only of one.
1338672320475521024 2020-12-15 10:28:47 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper How so? While I can believe there was shady business dealings, there's no evidence of collusion in election interference.  And the little interference they found... 15,000 election tweets by Russian bots? I could do that in five months. It's laughable.   Considering Twitter/FB
1338671595955564547 2020-12-15 10:25:54 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Because they aren't bogus. I don't take what any media tells me at face value.   Besides, the Bidens have never denied it. So why do you? I see it as more run of the mill corruption. It's the double standard I object to.
1338671275485646848 2020-12-15 10:24:38 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper We now know that the investigation was opened by Obama in 2016 under the request of Clinton who wished to smear Trump with Russia collusion.   I have no doubt that they kicked up run off the mill corruption but the bigger issue is the weaponization of the state.
1338670859716857862 2020-12-15 10:22:58 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I can agree that there was business dealing. I can even agree there was shady business dealings. Let's be honest, most business deals made by billionaires are shadey.   But because the FISA warrant was started under flimsy and political premises, I am skeptical of everything.
1338670411983228929 2020-12-15 10:21:12 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Right but that doesn't necessarily mean there was Russian Collusion.
1338669746095599618 2020-12-15 10:18:33 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I'm not suggesting anything. I like to keep my mind open to the possibility that I am wrong.
1338669038373908482 2020-12-15 10:15:44 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Okay. Who offered the alleged bribe?
1338667810805919744 2020-12-15 10:10:51 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I don't think the "soliciting perjury" stands from the what you showed me. Any employer would ask an employee to give a good account of their company.   I didn't see evidence of bribery.
1338667452750852099 2020-12-15 10:09:26 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper “...the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” (page 5)  That's much closer to "no evidence" than the media's claim about hundreds of affidavits.
1338666999057178626 2020-12-15 10:07:38 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper So you think the laptop is a conspiracy theory? Despite the FBI confirming it?
1338666793490124801 2020-12-15 10:06:49 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper But again. The Mueller report found no evidence of russian collusion yet you are convinced of it enough that you want him prosecuted.   That seems like cognitive dissonance to me.
1338663552702406661 2020-12-15 09:53:56 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I don't expect you to change your mind about Trump. I don't even like Trump myself.   I do hope you will learn to be more skeptical of the MAinstream media. They have actively lied to you to serve an agenda and I think you should be aware.
1338663193019879429 2020-12-15 09:52:31 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Fox doesn't even like Trump and actively and transparently worked agaisnt trump during the elction.
1338662943429439488 2020-12-15 09:51:31 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper  https://t.co/e6s8KhGgrx
1338662818325950465 2020-12-15 09:51:01 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Most of the court cases were rejected out of hand without looking at the evidence because  a. standing b. no judge wants to overturn the election  but the evidence is strong, it's just actively suppressed by the media.
1338662226748641280 2020-12-15 09:48:40 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper There's not much question if you give a fair examination of the laptop and former business associate testimony that Biden is involved in run-of-the-mill Washington corruption involving kickbacks from the Ukraine and China.   If you look, you will find it.
1338661928240033793 2020-12-15 09:47:29 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Do you not see that there is a polarization of the press such that the news you get your information from not only will ignore info harmful to the Democrats but will actively suppress it?  And I acknowledge that Fox news is bullshit. But even Fox news is against Trump.
1338661472495423489 2020-12-15 09:45:40 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I believe the witnesses who sounded very credible and whose stories are backed up by video evidence.   Also, as soon as the vote count was stopped in multiple states where Trump was winning, many suspected that this was Mexico 1988 all over again.
1338661171751219202 2020-12-15 09:44:29 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper The Mueller report found no evidence that Trump colluded with Russia.   The laptop exists. The emails have been verified via third parties.   But you are right, the establishment is treating it differently. That is the point I am trying to make.
1338660833468030981 2020-12-15 09:43:08 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Wait, we were told that the story was russian misinformation and the laptop doesn't exist. Both of those were not only untrue, but obviously untrue.   Yet I'm the liar for speaking the truth?
1338660408022929415 2020-12-15 09:41:27 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper you really eat up everything the news feeds you even after they lied to you about it?
1338660248668803075 2020-12-15 09:40:49 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Biden's lawyer called the repair shop and asked for the laptop back. The FBI says they have had it since 2019.   That's what I mean about a double standard. The media/tech establishment is against Trump. So the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
1338659431521914889 2020-12-15 09:37:34 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper I don't even like Trump, but it's so obvious that there is a double standard in how Trump is treated versus Biden.   Yet the evidence of Biden's corruption is more clear cut. He took half of everything his soon earned on the board of Burisma.
1338659089921024008 2020-12-15 09:36:12 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper How do we know, since it's the word of an anonymous source versus the WH?
1338658890716770304 2020-12-15 09:35:25 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Again, I don't see it. The crimes you mentioned were already covered during the Mueller report, which found no evidence of collusion.   Why would they prosecute after the fact?  It makes no sense.
1338658616727973892 2020-12-15 09:34:19 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Another anonymous WH source?
1338658489619652608 2020-12-15 09:33:49 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper By the same standard we should remove Joe Biden since he lied about meeting with Burisma. Have you given the Biden laptop, which the media actually suppressed, the same attention?
1338658238464745472 2020-12-15 09:32:49 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Was it another anonymous source?
1338658186044321792 2020-12-15 09:32:37 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @dubwan @bobclendenin @thecjpearson @realDonaldTrump Interesting.  So that's one Twitter user against hundreds of signed affidavits from Republicans saying they were unable to contest a single vote.
1338657827917848578 2020-12-15 09:31:11 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Are you mind reading?  Did Trump give a statement?  Or are you quoting an anonymous Press mindreader?
1338657601190584322 2020-12-15 09:30:17 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper That would be a great tool to remove any politician who is troublesome. Like the police use "resisting arrest" without any other underlying crime. If you don't see a problem with that, then I guess you deserve the totalitarianism you're inviting.
1338657325868081153 2020-12-15 09:29:12 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper “...the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” (page 5)  Mueller Report overview.
1338657087518281731 2020-12-15 09:28:15 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @bobclendenin @dubwan @thecjpearson @realDonaldTrump I don't know who "orchestrated" it. But eyewitness testimony is evidence. So that's hundreds of shreds of proof.  Also, there is corroborating video evidence.   And I haven't touched on the historical/statistical anomalies.
1338656764372389889 2020-12-15 09:26:58 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper *reportedly since it's secondhand information.
1338656653298851843 2020-12-15 09:26:31 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Obstructing justice for a crime that didn't happen.   And telling a guy he paid to speak kindly about his business?  Really?
1338656503352471552 2020-12-15 09:25:56 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @bobclendenin @dubwan @thecjpearson @realDonaldTrump So you are not concerned at all that the security user logs in tall the Dominion machines, while still intact from previous elections, were completely wiped after the 2020 election?
1338656168156205056 2020-12-15 09:24:36 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @dubwan @bobclendenin @thecjpearson @realDonaldTrump Do you have evidence they were disruptive or abusive?  See that's the ongoing abuse campaign. Since so many Democrats believe the "Very fine people" hoax it is easy for them to always demonize republicans.   I am not a republican but I can be objective.
1338655879374180353 2020-12-15 09:23:27 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper Obstruction of justice in an investigation that found him innocent?

1338655566143565826 2020-12-15 09:22:12 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @dubwan @bobclendenin @thecjpearson @realDonaldTrump The fraud is going to come out sooner or later. The only question is how it's going to work out in the short term.   The media's decision to ignore it, along with the election officials to evade, destroy evidence, and obstruct, is only confirming what many already know.
1338655302095425539 2020-12-15 09:21:09 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @dubwan @bobclendenin @thecjpearson @realDonaldTrump No. There are hundreds of Republican pollwatchers saying they were unable to contest a single ballot or to even get close enough to check ballots.   They have signed statements under penalty of perjury.   Video evidence confirms this.  https://t.co/7uN2sUMFCu
1338654471056928773 2020-12-15 09:17:51 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper So again, this is less bad than Biden/Burisma and Biden/China.   The only difference is the establishment hates Trump and loves Biden.

1338649417281376258 2020-12-15 08:57:46 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper How is it obstruction of justice for the President to ask for the scope of the investigation to be limited, an investigation, which while it hurt the country, found that there was no collusion or coordination?
1338649041467531264 2020-12-15 08:56:17 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper "Obstruction of justice" for a crime that never happened?

I'd guess if you figure that out you have answered your question.

When the other players return they discover that the dealer has dealt himself four aces.  When you cry foul, he demands that you provide evidence of how he cheated.
1338601149738446848 2020-12-15 05:45:58 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @jaketapper It turns out the Steele Dossier which was the base evidence used to open the FISA case, was   1.) Not credible  2.) Paid for by the Clinton campaign  Furthermore, Mueller states in his report that he did not find any evidence of collusion.
1338600676860030981 2020-12-15 05:44:06 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @renato_mariotti @jaketapper i.e. if the media keeps saying "there is zero evidence of zero fraud" many will believe it and ignore the eyewitness testimony, video evidence, and massive statistical anomalies.

The time correlates with a massive anomalous spike for Biden  https://t.co/q3wpz15p99

Turns out they were connection to the internet on election day. But all 2020 data wiped

Once you take partisan politics out of this it is much easier to see.  Which is why I am certain this election will go down as the most fraudulent in history regardless of the immediate outcome.

That means there is zero confirmation on millions of absentee ballots. This is the precise reason mass absentee ballots without voter ID is banned in Europe. It causes fraud.

1338515373436657665 2020-12-15 00:05:08 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @KeithDB80 @CathyYoung63 But the report does say that Dominion machines seem designed for fraud. The Biden coupsters won't tell you that.

1338513770495225857 2020-12-14 23:58:45 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CISAgov Rumour: The 2020 election was the most secure and fair ever.  Fact: There are reports of massive security breaches and Democrats obstructing ongoing investigations into fraud.

1338060240500252674 2020-12-13 17:56:35 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @barrydeutsch Right. But the murder problem is still much bigger than the police problem. As soon as the murder rate drops it will be easier to "defund the police."  It's important to follow the steps in order.  1.) Lower the murder rate. 2.) Defund the police.
1338054109145001985 2020-12-13 17:32:14 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Watchman1007 And they still made a profit doing it. That's not really a punishment, that's just cost of doing business.

This coincides with a massive spike for Biden.  https://t.co/J1XegXKvlJ

There's so much evidence that the media and tech oligarchy is having trouble suppressing it.   https://t.co/TW3KNixivX
1337524180187754498 2020-12-12 06:26:29 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Bill_Shapiro @AriFleischer Absolutely. Disregard Trump completely. I agree.  Now look at the obvious evidence of voter fraud.  Exhibit A: Democrats have sealed the evidence from a forensic voting machine that was (illegally) connected to the internet on election day.  Prima facie fraud.
1337523853183102976 2020-12-12 06:25:11 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @snowball1926 @travelingtrio2 I wonder why the Democrats have sealed the evidence that was found from a forensic investigation of the Dominion machines which were illegally connected to the internet on election night?
1337523604360220673 2020-12-12 06:24:11 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @EliseStefanik @nypost It was widespread voter suppression on the part of @twitter and facebook.

1337522885607493632 2020-12-12 06:21:20 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @AmandiOnAir The only thing worse than that is a political party that obviously cheated at the election and induced the big tech oligarchy to help hide their crime.
1337522602949152768 2020-12-12 06:20:13 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Bill_Shapiro @AriFleischer Your logic seems to be this...  because Trump said it, it therefore must be false.   If you just look at the fact that they stopped the vote count on election night that's prima facie evidence of fraud.
1337522355837472770 2020-12-12 06:19:14 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Bill_Shapiro @AriFleischer I don't trust Trump or ANY news media. I do believe ordinarty Americans like these:   https://t.co/hDd3sN0SVt
1337522217895260167 2020-12-12 06:18:41 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @LJCity @LizRNC I don't watch those. I watched the hearings. They kicked out Republican observers by force while the Democrats cheereed.   This is blatant and widespread voter fraud. And it will go down in history as such regardless of the courts' hasty decisions.
1337520953018945537 2020-12-12 06:13:39 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Bill_Shapiro @AriFleischer They also said there was "zero evidence" of Hunter Biden's corruption.  When someone in the media says there is "zero evidence" that means there is lots of confirmed evidence that they are hiding while they lie to your face.  This ain't my first rodeo, Herr Goebbels.
1337520655659626498 2020-12-12 06:12:28 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Bill_Shapiro @AriFleischer So you haven't listened to any of the hearings?
1337520305355550720 2020-12-12 06:11:05 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RepStevenSmith So when they say "there's no evidence of voter fraud" it means the same as when they said "there's no evidence of Hunter Biden's misdeeds."  When CNN says "there's no evidence" what they really mean is there is massive amounts of confirmed evidence that they won't show you.
1337519561369935877 2020-12-12 06:08:07 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Bill_Shapiro @AriFleischer Well there's a reason that mass absentee ballots without voter ID are banned throughout the world.  They tried it in England a few years back and found massive fraud. No they require voter ID.
1337518730809585670 2020-12-12 06:04:49 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @demontage2000 @Scotus They don't need to. Later they may even later call it a mistake. The idea is to slow everything down and let inertia, assisted by the big tech oligarchy, to force their will through.   This is a power play.

1337510294705369089 2020-12-12 05:31:18 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @TrumpRulzz @nevrsalty They know if you just scratch at the surface with an investigation it all crumbles into a giant heap of fraud.

1337507844371963905 2020-12-12 05:21:34 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> Meet your new overlords. They will not stand for criticism.
1337507063551959041 2020-12-12 05:18:28 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump Nazis also used disease and its stigma to dehumanize their political opponents.
1337476584060694534 2020-12-12 03:17:21 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Judith_Char Nazis were politically correct in their time and place and enforced their peculiar brand of racism just like SJW's.

1337476032589422592 2020-12-12 03:15:09 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @20_odysseus Well done.
1337463388629299200 2020-12-12 02:24:55 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @marceelias There's massive overwhelming evidence of election fraud.  Video evidence in Fulton county after the observers left and media informed voting stopped-  they continued counting without bipartisan observation.
1337461958967226376 2020-12-12 02:19:14 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @EPoe187 What's your take on the clear video evidence of election fraud that took place in Fulton county?  I am amazed that not a single academic professor has called out the clear and undeniable evidence of election fraud.  Not one.

1337459656483098626 2020-12-12 02:10:05 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MZHemingway Well we also mean the actual vote counting that happened on election night without observation after the entire country was told by MSM that they stopped counting.  That's quantifiable fraud with video evidence that overturned the election.

1337450096007503873 2020-12-12 01:32:06 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @DamonBruce Sedition is openly stealing an election.

1337447130823340038 2020-12-12 01:20:19 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Congrats on successfully rigging an election in plainsight while the mainstream media pushes this through.  Biden killed America.

1337346402972803075 2020-12-11 18:40:03 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @TheHinduDindu Off topic but I just rescued a character named Brick on Cyberpunk 2077. I assume that means you donated to their kickstarter.
1337345307496095745 2020-12-11 18:35:42 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Beth_Alize to be fair they carried off the biggest fraudulent election in the world on video and looks like they will get away with it.

1337309498084618240 2020-12-11 16:13:25 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @ProvitaSua @ScottAdamsSays The issue with that woman is she said a lot of things beyond what she saw.   However, the next two witnesses after her were the type I call "radically honest." They ony spoke directly to what they saw.   If you ignore eyewitness testimony, ask yourself, are you consistent?
1337292548130398209 2020-12-11 15:06:03 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Inductivist What happened was Facebook and Twitter engaged in active voter suppression.
1337287700181905409 2020-12-11 14:46:47 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> I would say that @jack's team's decision to remove the now proven true Hunter Biden story and to permanently suspend smaller accounts who shared it, is a form of voter suppression.

1337269488492965888 2020-12-11 13:34:25 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @senatormelendez Because the media knows better than the "little people."

1337268915148361728 2020-12-11 13:32:09 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Tim_jbo She's probably on the  Dem payroll.  AP is cited by Youtube as an official source yet the 2016 Podesta emails revealed that the DNC told them when to release their articles. Any surprise the AP is eager to call the election as an "official" source for their friend?

1337256028342157313 2020-12-11 12:40:56 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CNN I assume it's for the greatest election fraud of all time.

This is what us called a color revolution. It's already happened and you are brainwashed by the MSM.  There's clear and massive fraud. It may take years but historians will agree. We no longer live in a democracy. Don't complain when you realize it.  https://t.co/fe1ciOWcgb

Not all were credible but many were.  You are handwaving here. The eye witnesses are very credible. They were kicked out. There's video. They were unable to challenge a single ballot.

They are normal people. The last four years normal Republicans have been demonized as Nazis.  But these witnesses are credible.  Many signed affidavits the day after  election, unsolicited.

1337214781405716481 2020-12-11 09:57:02 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Gilberto42 @CathyYoung63 What's dangerous is ignoring the fraud or believing that the thousands of witnesses are part of a conspiracy.
1337214093636362242 2020-12-11 09:54:18 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CathyYoung63 There's overwhelming evidence of election fraud unless you think all the pollwatcher witnesses of both parties are in a conspiracy.

1337009416667852800 2020-12-10 20:21:00 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @EveKeneinan But it sounds like Hell to mandate that we build and maintain illusory and false concepts for the "benefit" of obviously troubled indivilduals.

1336862589645692929 2020-12-10 10:37:33 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Mesocycloon @realDonaldTrump @GOP @marceelias I don't care about winning. I don't even like Trump. I'm a registered Democrat.   What concerns me is that election integrity has been clearly and openly impugned.   Once you have nontransparency by force/deception, you don't have a Democracy.
1336862341175123969 2020-12-10 10:36:34 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Mesocycloon @realDonaldTrump @GOP Right. But if there was fraud that would expose it. This is exactly why it is a bad idea to have mass mail in ballots without voter ID.   What signature matches will catch is if there's the same signature or no signature.   Absentee ballots were always 30x more fraudulent.
1336857761372655619 2020-12-10 10:18:22 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Mesocycloon @realDonaldTrump @GOP Two years from now, when you are not so highly polarized and have less cognitive bias, you will realize that there was fraud.   Right now you can't see it because it is a struggle of will.
1336857477070065665 2020-12-10 10:17:14 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Mesocycloon @realDonaldTrump @GOP I don't like Trump and I don't trust him.   What convinces me is my own eyes.   They stopped the vote count on election night- unprecedented.  Mass mail in ballots without voter ID are banned in Europe.   The media consistently lies and censors against conservatives.
1336856680592789504 2020-12-10 10:14:04 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Mesocycloon @realDonaldTrump @GOP In fact, if they had merely applied the same rules as all other elections to the ballots, we would have expected to see enough ballots thrown out for Trump to win...  and that's before we get to the dead people.  https://t.co/yx4jLEvpGF
1336856375679459328 2020-12-10 10:12:52 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Mesocycloon @realDonaldTrump @GOP yet not once did they do a signature audit as the Governor promised the first time.   If you count counterfeit money three times, you still have counterfeit money.
1336856155973423104 2020-12-10 10:11:59 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Mesocycloon @realDonaldTrump @GOP I would say that MLK JR also suffered many setbacks in court before prevailing.  It's prima facie fishy, unless you are drinking the MSM kool aid. I mean, can you name another election in which the vote counting was stopped and one candidate suddenly decided to give a speech?

Watch the witnesses. This is going to go down in history as the biggest election fraud in history.

1336846229020561410 2020-12-10 09:32:33 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Mesocycloon @realDonaldTrump @GOP It just so happens to coincide PERFECTLY with a massive anomolous vote spike for Biden.   This is a smoking gun. Don't let the media hoodwink you. We've known since 2016 they are in the tank with the Democrats.
1336845965257486337 2020-12-10 09:31:30 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Mesocycloon @realDonaldTrump @GOP I did. I read it.   Sounds like we should call all the witnesses into court.   All major news networks said Fulton county was stopping the vote count on election night around 10:30pm.   Then we saw votes being counted without bipartisan observation.
1336845530455011328 2020-12-10 09:29:46 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @breadman28 @kylenabecker the problem is that it is really a criminal case at heart.
1336844212579528704 2020-12-10 09:24:32 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Mesocycloon @realDonaldTrump @GOP Then, without observors, they continued counting which coincided with a massive anomolous vote spike for Biden.  Unlike other cities, they didn't use force in Atlanta, they used deception. Both the press, the MSM, and observors, were told that the vote count was stopping.  https://t.co/6cM32XEQhP
1336843905158049799 2020-12-10 09:23:19 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Mesocycloon @realDonaldTrump @GOP So fact check on the fact check- "suitcases" is a red herring.   Signed affidavits say they were told the vote count was stopping for the night, so they left.  Five major media networks also said Atlanta was stopping counting for the night on Nov. 3rd.
1336842728810962946 2020-12-10 09:18:38 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @HowleyReporter It's a cultural movement similar to China. The young are being indoctrinated into the woke ideology.
1336842419233583108 2020-12-10 09:17:24 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Mesocycloon @realDonaldTrump @GOP Fortunately, in Fulton country, they have video footage of the count continuing after Republican observors, and the media, were told that counting was finished for the night.   So that's video evidence, coupled with signed affidavits, coinciding with a massive, anomolous spike.  https://t.co/F9bbZUlqON
1336842059295166470 2020-12-10 09:15:58 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Mesocycloon @realDonaldTrump @GOP No. You just need to prove that you kicked out Republican voters by force or deception. Both happened. That's it. At that point, the election is tainted.   You can't kick out all the Republican observors and then demand the same observors prove fraud.
1336841776515133440 2020-12-10 09:14:51 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @DrKarlynB But if you don't hold the exact same ideology as me you are literally denying my right to exist.

If you kick out all Republicans in major cities and then suddenly have anomolous vote spikes all for Biden, then people will become suspicious.   The witnesses are highly credible.   https://t.co/ollKuvG0iF

1336465463417696256 2020-12-09 08:19:31 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @IlhanMN Republican observors were kicked out by force and deception.   That violates the integrity of the election.   End of story.
1336462849653223427 2020-12-09 08:09:08 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @FOX10Phoenix I'm willing to die for this cause. Without fair and free elections, we don't have a country. Once you remove transparency in election by force or deception, you no longer have a fair and free election.
1336462149363838985 2020-12-09 08:06:21 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @John_JODonnell Once you have non transparency by force or deception, you no longer have  fair and free election. Without a fair and free election we are no longer a representational republic and the next step is war.
1336461849299210248 2020-12-09 08:05:09 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @John_JODonnell In Georgia, observors were tricked into leaving while ballots were counted. Their debunk was debunked. At the exact same time Fulton county reported a giant spike of mostly Biden votes.   That's evidence. I agree that we need to hear the witnesses, but that is evidence.
1336461265988935681 2020-12-09 08:02:50 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @John_JODonnell I have never seen evidence this credible for bigfoot. These are normal people saying that Republican ovservors were kicked out and not replaced and they were unable to succesfully contest a single ballot despite watching ballots being filled out.   https://t.co/HPLj3Lx8M9
1336459281563070466 2020-12-09 07:54:57 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @John_JODonnell You implied that eyewitness testimony is unreliable.   Which I took to mean you opposed the #believewomen movement which is founded upon trust in eyewitness testimony.   Checking to see if you were consistent. (you weren't.)

That's not "control of our lives" in the same way the governors in N?Y and California have it.   Plenty of room for criticism but your framing fits Democrat governors better.

1334787176626855936 2020-12-04 17:10:36 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CottoGottfried It feels like our legal system has been under direct assault for a while.  #believewomen was an attack on due process.  #blm was also an attack on due process.  Narrative reigns over presumption of innocence.  I'm afraid the election fraud strain might cause it to snap entirely.

1334769510092509184 2020-12-04 16:00:24 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @BreeNewsome You can't "defund the police" until you solve the murder problem in American cities.   Once you stop all the murders, you can easily defund the police.   Fix the root, not the symptom.

1334768354419232771 2020-12-04 15:55:49 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @FaldettaNick @CottoGottfried Probably the Democrats have been cheating in those cities for decades. Slow counting is a HUGE red flag for fraud.
1334767604519608325 2020-12-04 15:52:50 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @mdjohnson9 @KamVTV @BrandonStraka The governor said he would do an audit with signature match.   That might do it.
1334767208891871235 2020-12-04 15:51:16 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @BrandonStraka It's a little too quiet.   I re-read Sidney Powell's lawsuit and they mention the Arena Farm video. But I never imagined this.   Assuming the witness testimony matches, this is the biggest election fraud in the history of the country.
1334766315786153984 2020-12-04 15:47:43 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @tekstone @Kokuzoku2 @commondreams The world needs to band together to apply anti trust against google.
1334765133416058881 2020-12-04 15:43:01 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CottoGottfried Democrats believe they are still entitled to these  votes, as well as those of minorities, (Biden's infamous "you ain't black,") with ballot-harvesting and now universal absentee ballots.  Easily justifiable to cast the votes of minorities for them if you see it this way.
1334763376459853825 2020-12-04 15:36:02 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @wjtopp @EpochTimes @SidneyPowell1 Don't you understand that they were continuously reporting their vote tallies throughout the day?  So that between the last report and the next, they know that they couldn't possibly process hundreds of thousands of votes.  Get past your cognitive dissonance.
1334762929669935104 2020-12-04 15:34:15 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Cousin_M @EpochTimes @SidneyPowell1 It's possible they did. Especially in Wayne Country, Hillary got 95% of the vote.   In Australia they have mandatory voting and they don't get that much of the vote.   It's a huge red flag for fraud.   Especially alongside all the other witnesses under oath saying there was fraud
1334762589973262336 2020-12-04 15:32:54 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @EnemaPolitical @EpochTimes @SidneyPowell1 Agreed. Where are they?
1334762404983566336 2020-12-04 15:32:10 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Wholaughin @EpochTimes @SidneyPowell1 It takes hours to process that many votes. Because they had been uploading the vote tally throughout the night as they were processed, they know that there was not enough time to provess the number of votes they added after a few short hours.
1334761453782503424 2020-12-04 15:28:23 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @JackPolakoff @piper_low @TeamTrump @RudyGiuliani Nobody saw WTC 7 coming. That was the last time that the deep state slipped the mask for the world to see. Now we see it with the obvious and massive election fraud.   100's of witnesses in MI, PA, and Georgia, that they were not allowed to reject ballots for any reason.
1334759959553318912 2020-12-04 15:22:27 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @AurelianofRome @SwipeWright Well Princeton is self-admittedly racist and they still receive government funding.
1334759076870451200 2020-12-04 15:18:57 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @WayneDupreeShow These witnesses made my cry. I hungered for the truth and they gave it to me straight. I have no doubt in the truthfulness of their testimony.
1334758728571170816 2020-12-04 15:17:34 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @dsgoldfield22 @SputnikInt @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump I think if Biden concedes he should be allowed to be there. He may not have had direct knowledge of the widespread mail in voting fraud that occurred during the election.

1334757987320279041 2020-12-04 15:14:37 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Andrew_Havranek @GovEvers @realDonaldTrump the Democrats are the party of cry-bullies. They cheat at elections and throw out the Republicans and don't allow them to challenge a single ballot.   Then they cry victim when they are called on total bullshit shenanigans.
1334752833858662400 2020-12-04 14:54:08 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NeverTrumpTexan @RealCandaceO It also happened in Georgia. In Sidney Powell's suit.   56. An Affiant testified, under oath, that “It was also of particular interest to me to see that signatures were not being verified and that there were no corresponding envelopes seen in site.”
1334752701083766784 2020-12-04 14:53:37 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NeverTrumpTexan @RealCandaceO That's from Georgia suit.
1334752651016335361 2020-12-04 14:53:25 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NeverTrumpTexan @RealCandaceO Yes there are. The news just hasn't told you.   56 "An Affiant testified, under oath, that “It was also of particular interest to me to see that signatures were not being verified and that there were no corresponding envelopes seen in site.” (Attached hereto as Exh. 10,)
1334751416783613952 2020-12-04 14:48:30 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NeverTrumpTexan @RealCandaceO They are processing ballots without observors present after they told the observors to leave under the lie that they would be stopping.   IF the witness testimony supports that, then this video  corroborates that.   This is a smoking gun, assuming the witness testimony stands.
1334751005200756736 2020-12-04 14:46:52 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NeverTrumpTexan @RealCandaceO No. Republicans were not allowed to succesfully challenge a single ballot in Wayne county.   There were similar allegations in Atlanta. In fact, that is the whole game, even in this video before the observors left, they were not being allowed to challenge.
1334750703940669441 2020-12-04 14:45:40 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NeverTrumpTexan @RealCandaceO So there is plenty of witness testimony just none that you or I have yet seen beyond the file Sidney Powell made in a seperate case.
1334750560529027072 2020-12-04 14:45:06 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NeverTrumpTexan @RealCandaceO Affidavits are written witness testimony. I agree that we should hear these witnesses ASAP.
1334750351564681217 2020-12-04 14:44:16 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NeverTrumpTexan @RealCandaceO Furthermore, if allegations are true, that votes were both switched and empty ballots filled out for Biden, in conjunction with intent to deceive and spoiliation of evidence, we have an interesting case indeed when contrasted to statistical anomalies.
1334750074056945665 2020-12-04 14:43:10 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NeverTrumpTexan @RealCandaceO But we have not done a single signature match.   When we check the signatures, it's going to expose the fraud. Georgia has a voter signature database.   Dominion wiping their server when a judge said not to is called "spoiliation of evidence."   https://t.co/pgcb11yZZv.
1334749479195570178 2020-12-04 14:40:48 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NeverTrumpTexan @RealCandaceO The narration does affect my understanding.   But assuming, the witness testimony corroborates her narrative then yes, this is a smoking gun.   The faux debunking is a tell that the cognitive dissonance is real.
1334749117063573504 2020-12-04 14:39:22 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NeverTrumpTexan @RealCandaceO I get that Guliani is a partisan. I trust him no more than I trust the media. They both have incentives to lie.   However, Dominion has not appeared at any of the hearings.
1334748920623271936 2020-12-04 14:38:35 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NeverTrumpTexan @RealCandaceO Sorry from Michigan but all these cases are related, clearly, similar tactics.
1334748317633409026 2020-12-04 14:36:12 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NeverTrumpTexan @RealCandaceO Did you even watch the election on election night?  https://t.co/6kOtrBKHZf
1334748195306549248 2020-12-04 14:35:42 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NeverTrumpTexan @RealCandaceO However, here we have video evidence of intent to deceive.
1334748091820478465 2020-12-04 14:35:18 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NeverTrumpTexan @RealCandaceO I understand your point. I have NOT heard the testimony of the Fulton witnesses.   But I have heard witnesses in Arizona and Michigan and in Detroit I found them to be HIGHLY credible witnesses of election fraud.
1334746907000844288 2020-12-04 14:30:35 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NeverTrumpTexan @RealCandaceO I am partially relying on the eyewitness testimonies and affidavits of the observers and press who were told to leave.  In context that's two pieces of evidence showing a clear attempt to deceive. Having established intent to deceive, everything is suspect.
1334746534915821569 2020-12-04 14:29:06 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NeverTrumpTexan @RealCandaceO Except for the fact that they were counting after pausing the vote count and sending everyone home.   They did something similar in Detroit that same night.  And Milwaukee.  I understand that your cognitive bias won't allow you to see the obvious, but work with me here.
1334745811159277571 2020-12-04 14:26:14 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NeverTrumpTexan @RealCandaceO Not easy access. 30 days after a contested election, the President's besieged lawyers pried it loose from the arena.  It turns out, you're not allowed to deal the cards when your opponent is not in the room. Especially if you suddenly drop four aces.
1334745058155900930 2020-12-04 14:23:14 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @DavidHu20354920 @ethkeffel @bluemadie12 @patriotLEO82 @RealCandaceO Spoiler alert: he didn't really drink it. It was a political stunt to minimize the problem without addressing it.   Now we have video evidence. We don't have time for court. I have no doubt that this will go down as the largest election fraud in the history of the world.
1334744756350574593 2020-12-04 14:22:02 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @DavidHu20354920 @ethkeffel @bluemadie12 @patriotLEO82 @RealCandaceO That's like Obama drinking the water in Flint, Michigan.  I witnessed fraud on election night. I have heard fellow Americans, the IT employee and Indian-American immigrant in Detroit who said that Republicans were targeted and ejected and that not one challenge to a ballot stood.

1334714091001311232 2020-12-04 12:20:11 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @DianaWintah The #believewomen movement taught me to always be skeptical.  If he is convicted by a jury I'll believe it. Otherwise not.

I am a Democrat but I can't accept election fraud.

Turns out that cheating is not actually winning.  There's video evidence and hundreds of corroborating affidavits.

There's video evidence of election fraud in Fulton Georgia when there was an alleged water leak. Instead they processed 18,000 ballots without bipartisan observation.  It's over.

1334432237585113088 2020-12-03 17:40:12 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Alyssa_Milano The testimony of the next two witnesses after her changed my mind forever.  This is much more evidence than Christine Blasey Ford ever gave.

1334415959537446912 2020-12-03 16:35:31 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @ZubyMusic The witnesss testimony of anti-white racism that took place in Wayne county was deeply disturbing.
1334412762064310273 2020-12-03 16:22:49 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @gerrynkennedy I didn't find her testimony particularly creidble, but the next two witnesses made me break down in tears. It's obvious there was coordinated fraud during this election.
1334412113742352386 2020-12-03 16:20:14 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @AuntInAZ Her testimony and his was the most credible and irrefutable evidence of fraud that I have seen to date.
1334409974181728256 2020-12-03 16:11:44 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Judith_Char Judith I have only ever known you as a level headed speaker of truth and common sense.   He religious relation to feminism is similar to a christian's attachment to their religion. They see you as "bashing" their religion.
1334398548658573312 2020-12-03 15:26:20 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Cernovich @Truthteller1349 I cried when I watched her testify the first time. This is credible. This is the truth.   That's what I wanted to hear. This is the real deal.
1334376624712716290 2020-12-03 13:59:13 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CottoGottfried I found those two pollworkers testimony extremely credible. And that is fraud enough for me to know that the election has been compromised. At least in Michigan, and I suspect in Pennsylvania as well.   I'm not sold elsewhere just yet.
1334366099396321281 2020-12-03 13:17:24 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @believe_coach I wept when I saw this. I prayed to know the truth and this is the first witness that I find unequivocally credible.  I am so angry. But whatever happens, at least I was able to hear the truth with my own ears.
1334353128829956097 2020-12-03 12:25:51 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @TPostMillennial This is definitely going to go down in history as the biggest fraud with mass mail-in ballots since 1864.
1334352279412084738 2020-12-03 12:22:29 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @AwakenedOutlaw @rn__deplorable The thing is... this same basic story was available the morning of November 4th if you were paying attention. Canvassers in Wayne country getting kicked out and others bringing in ballots inside unauthorized containers.  This is where we were at on the morning of November 4th.

1334277534540763142 2020-12-03 07:25:28 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @EPoe187 As soon as we reduce the homicide and violent crime rate then we can defund the police.  It's the height of naivete to ignore the murder problem.

That's why many women believe all men are like that, because the ten percent of men they are interested in are like that.  And they are like that because they receive so much interest.

1334216862733889536 2020-12-03 03:24:23 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @evan_greer First you have to reduce the murder rate.  Abolishing police before you have lowered the homicide rate is insane.

1334172220969652227 2020-12-03 00:26:59 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @samstein @CathyYoung63 Trump was impeached because of one anonymous witness.   And yet we won't listen to hundreds of pollwatchers on both sides saying that there was no meaningful bipartisan witness for hundreds of thousands of ballots?

Anamolous, suspicious all Biden ballot drop at the same time that poll watchers were blocked and the windows were covered.

But during the general election the rejection rate for ballots was almost 0%  Classic Democrat- rules for thee but not for me!
1333877701560709121 2020-12-02 04:56:40 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @kevincorke Why is the ballot rejection rate at less than 1% ?  When Democrats kicked the Green Party off the ballot it qas because of a high rejection rate on their signatures.  So no rejection for Democrats and high rejection for other parties?
1333873875017474049 2020-12-02 04:41:28 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CNN CNN thinks it can keep its eyes closed to widespread election fraud.  It's going to come out eventually so the sooner the better.  Deliberately ignoring the evidence is irresponsible.

1333584348524769280 2020-12-01 09:31:00 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Kate9675 @johncusack @GOP A lot of what the LEft media did gets blamed on Trump. For example, they divided the country by pushing the "very fine people" hoax and the Russian Collusion hoax, as well as the impeachment hoax.

1333580018941890560 2020-12-01 09:13:47 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @TeamTrump To be clear, Twitter suspended him for testifying at this hearing, not for something that he tweeted.

1333575777405857793 2020-12-01 08:56:56 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @azcentral Get ready for a new civil war. Cheating at the elections and then having big tech help with the coverup is bullshit.

1333568850445668352 2020-12-01 08:29:25 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @PeterVroom1 @mkraju Um... they cheated. Pull your head out of the sand and look at the evidence with integrity.
1333568532563570694 2020-12-01 08:28:09 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Real_QL More Russian Collusion Hoax?  Remember the Impeachment Hoax?  Turns out Trump's investigation into Biden paid off. There corruption is real.

1333567743937949696 2020-12-01 08:25:01 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Lis_aLouu @RonColeman It's because all the people that work at Twitter have been indoctrinated. They don't hire conservatives to counterbalance. The Twitterati are unconscious bigots, but not usually consciously bigoted.  They just hate all conservatives equally.

1333542819152224257 2020-12-01 06:45:58 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Cernovich I mean if they applied a one percent rejection rate to the ballots that never signature matched, that means Trump wins.
1333542479333822464 2020-12-01 06:44:37 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @SkyNewsAust Nope. It's not final until the Second Civil War is over.

1333521928867500033 2020-12-01 05:22:58 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @DianaWintah We assume trauma for women even if none exists.  We assume benefit for men even it's non consensual.

1333493999592726529 2020-12-01 03:31:59 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CNN The only reason to rush through the process while a hearing for massive credible fraud is taking place is to force it through against the will of the people.  I'm a Democrat but I still want all the facts.

Most significant are whistleblowers in Wayne county saying there was fraud before they were kicked out.  https://t.co/aKYSmXLeP4

1333234662588764162 2020-11-30 10:21:28 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @RandPaul the ballot rejection rate was almost zero. When Ballotwatchers tried to reject illegal ballots they were kicked out. (Sworn affidavits.)  There's tons of evidence just not enough time.

1333234147553325056 2020-11-30 10:19:25 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RUMINT79 @RandPaul No. If they merely applied the normal ballot rejection rates then Trump wins. The fact that they weren't rejecting any ballots, combined with testimony under oath from ballot watchers that they were kicked out when they pointed out problems is an open shut case of fraud.  https://t.co/B8tYwcRkxh

Everyone agreed to simultaneously stop counting votes in five swing states where Trump was winning.   At 4am, when scrutineers said illegal, "biden only" ballots were brought in unauthorized containers, there were sudden drops:  https://t.co/cR20JzfncW

1332854138879807491 2020-11-29 09:09:24 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @WPXIAaronMartin Remember those mail-in ballots were counted without meaningful bipartisan observation in contravenance of two hundred years of tradition and law.  https://t.co/Po1ZOcquME

1332853040043487237 2020-11-29 09:05:02 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Hail__To_You Nope. You must have 270 to win.   Otherwise the states make their votes. More states would voted for Trump.

As a Democrat, I hate Trump, but the integrity of our elections is paramount. I don't want Trump to win but I want Democrats to get away with cheating even less.
1332851751490351104 2020-11-29 08:59:55 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Ethan242424 @ScottAdamsSays Pennsylvania is close, if they tip, Georgia and Michigan will follow, meaning Biden would no longer have 270.

1332851031756189698 2020-11-29 08:57:03 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Hail__To_You More realistically, getting three of the above states to simply abstain their electoral votes would work.

Better to let people do as they will and make recommendations than try to impose authority and have a backlash like this.

1332837277618286593 2020-11-29 08:02:24 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CNN As a registered Democrat I am concerned about the election fraud and CNN's total vow of silence on the facts.
1332836311724666882 2020-11-29 07:58:34 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @JoeBiden Any comment in the obvious election fraud.  I am a registered Democrat in a swing state but i want answers.

The only credible threats I have heard are from the Brownshirts, Antifa, threatening lawyers, polititicans, and pollworkers... basically anyone willing to stand up against the Democrat Party establishment cheating.
1332832818439860225 2020-11-29 07:44:41 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @WPXIAaronMartin @RonColeman Well it's clear that the Democrats cheated by not allowing meaningful bipartisan observation and I say this as a registered Democrat.  Election integrity comes before party loyalty.   I hate to say it but it looks like Trump won.
1332832240422821890 2020-11-29 07:42:23 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @scubas84 @nckokiko @Jayne4Susan @JakeCorman @centredaily @RepBenninghoff Then why are all the Dominion employees deleting their Linkedin accounts?  What's funny about the debunk is that they went to Dominion executives who denied the claims and stopped there.  That's like Ted Bundy debunking claims he was a serial killer.

Or that magically a million arrived on the days after election day.   Pennsylvania is such a black box and they made the Republicans look with binoculars.  https://t.co/z9JQbO6xi1

What makes it so troubling is that they are trying to obscure the facts about the election fraud. The numbers just don't add up.

With that lens, there is nothing morally wrong about cheating in the elections since from their perspective it is merely the oppressed rising up.

1332005090857799682 2020-11-27 00:55:35 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @19ranger57 @realDonaldTrump 1.) One percent error rate would overturn the election.   2.) No meaningful bipartisan observation   3.)

1331887994601615360 2020-11-26 17:10:17 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @thehill And Putin. Looks like the targeted fraud is going to melt. The case against the Democrats is just too strong.   This is going to get interesting.   The fraud is unquestionably within the margin of error.   They are going to try to jam it through but that won't work.

Meanwhile, Twitter deleted a PA senator's twitter account for tweeting this:  https://t.co/UD2rnaHMqQ

1331790861374533633 2020-11-26 10:44:19 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @complexifire @TonyChay6 @EricRWeinstein No. It was presented in the hearing in PA today.  I guess it's safe to assume you didn't watch it.   Even if they just rejected the normal ratio of mail in ballots from previous year, it's a clear Trump victory.  https://t.co/VbFicNPIB6

I'm sorry but until you explain how a batch of over half a million votes went 99.5% for Biden, your bias is clear.
1331787050635436032 2020-11-26 10:29:10 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Cernovich 570k versus 3,200.  that's 99.5% for Biden.

In that case, even a good person would do evil.

1331624623033692162 2020-11-25 23:43:45 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @mike_wanaoni @JoeBiden Correct me if I am wrong, but there are hundreds of affidavits from pollwatchers, including Democrat party whistle blowers, who are willing to testify under oath that election fraud occurred.  How is that "no evidence of fraud?"

Pausing or delaying vote count for artificial reasons.   This allows the Dem precincts in major urban areas to find out how many Biden only ballots they need to manufacture in a short amount of time.   Witnesses confirm

A high turnout in specific areas Even where the turnout is within the bounds of possibility, if the figure is wildly different from the turnout elsewhere, it serves as a warning.  Why would one particular area, or one individual polling station, have a 90% turnout,
1331622829977186306 2020-11-25 23:36:37 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @IdentifiesAsHum @jawtheshark @CathyYoung63 1.)  Too many voters Watch the turnout figures ‒ they can be a big giveaway.  You never get a 98% or 99% turnout in an honest election. You just don't.   ...in Australia... where you can vote by post or online and can be fined for not voting, turnout only reaches 90-95%.
1331622523335823361 2020-11-25 23:35:24 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @IdentifiesAsHum @jawtheshark @CathyYoung63 Well if you say it under oath you can go to jail.  At the very least I'd like to hear it. Otherwise what is the point of poll watchers?  Especially with all the red flags for fraud. As per the BBC.   https://t.co/lTjsqWfOZX

There are hundreds of affidavits, including Democrat party pollworkers, alleging that election fraud took place.  Mass mail-in ballots with voter ID always leads to fraud. Which is why it is banned in Europe.

In Australia, voting is mandatory and they don't get 95% voter turnout.   So when precincts are voting at 95% turnout and above, that is a red flag. It's especially in conjunction with mass mail-in ballots without voter ID that Europe banned it.

The essential argument comes down to who had the right to be there- Antifa or Kyle.  I'd say they cancel each other out. It boils down to a 17 year old being chased by a convicted pedophile.

The first guy that Rittenhouse shot was a provably white supremacist pedophil who was chasing him. Even then, Kyle didn't shoot until Antifa opened fire first.  It's almost as if you haven't watched the videos.

1330576445572263940 2020-11-23 02:18:40 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @mtracey By "grandiose" conspiracy theories do you mean the well documented exclusion of Republican pollwatchers in key urban areas of multiple swing states shortly before they dropped hundreds of thousands of "Biden only" votes at 4am November 4th?

As a blue checkmark, the shock of such a reality would shake the establishment and their place in it.

And there are Democrat Party poll workers who have eyewitness testimony of late night ballot shenanigans on machines that are foriegn owned and tied to the Clinton foundation.   I mean, let's at least hear this out. Even if nothing changes.

I got H1N1 after my wife did and it was the most miserable two weeks of my life.   Covid-19, while certainly frightening, was milder in symptoms and for me, mostly consisted of a light fever, sore throat, and inability to sleep very well.

And CNN is already running hit pieces calling Parler a " threat to democracy."  Unfortunately, it seems final solution for the Left is gas chambers for conservatives.

1327101483536568322 2020-11-13 12:10:24 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @clairlemon In India, a man have been arrested for breaking up a sexual relationship with a woman they are engaged to.   They call it "rape."  I think it's gone too far.

1326676941383065603 2020-11-12 08:03:25 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @SamHarrisOrg 1. Trump was winning handily.  2. Sudden unprecedented pause of the vote count  3. Unprecedented speech by Biden  4.

If there's one good thing about Trump it's that he's redpilled 70 million americans to the MSM bullshit.   It's weapons-grade CIA propaganda.
1325714462452625408 2020-11-09 16:18:53 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @GeneSatoshi @_Peeve_ @SamHarrisOrg No he's an idiot. But I like his de escalation of Middle East occupation. Four middle east peace deals.   I think he is the best on China. That's why I switched my vote. Americans do not see the Thucydides trap regarding China.   But MSM hates him because he is not establishment.
1325713912113860613 2020-11-09 16:16:41 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @dilemma5832 @mtracey You realize that mass mail in ballots without voter ID always lead to fraud?  What makes it suspicious is the obvious gaslighting by media/tech monopoly censoring a sitting president and trying to force it through before there can be a full audit.   https://t.co/ytKmo7A0lw
1325712319876313089 2020-11-09 16:10:22 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @GeneSatoshi @_Peeve_ @SamHarrisOrg I disagree. I have often and repeatedly seen the media take the least charitable interpretation to his words. Most notoriously, for years, they convinced America that Trump had called neo-nazis "very fine people."  I'm glad the BBC finally put that to be with their factcheck.

They are both lying bullshitters.  Biden sprinkles a little sugar on his shit first.  And MSM approves.

Try as he may, Sam just doesn't understand working class men and women.   There's no real qualitative difference between Biden and Trump other than Biden being more polished and politically correct.
1325695952716521473 2020-11-09 15:05:20 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @SamHarrisOrg I will always remember Sam Harris as the most irrational case of TDS on display.

1325667230105948160 2020-11-09 13:11:12 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MetroRepublican @chadfelixg Not true.   70 million Americans just watched Hammer Scorecard of the Dominion software flip the election for the Democrats and you haven't seen any armed protests in the street yet.

That is no longer the case. They are just as fraudulent-prone now but there are orders of magnitude more.

Absentee ballots were solicited. Mail in ballot request forms went out unsolicited. Absentee ballots had the highest rates of fraud but formerly only made up 1% of the total.

But fraud most often happens with absentee ballots.  This year we have increased the number of ballots by orders of magnitude. Thus any errors/fraud will likely compound as well.

1325386869736165381 2020-11-08 18:37:08 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself @Peoples_Pundit @Barnes_Law It was surreal.  https://t.co/njT2VaKG36
1325386695957680129 2020-11-08 18:36:27 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself @Peoples_Pundit @Barnes_Law Everything was going as expected.   They suddenly paused the vote count in an unprecedented move. Then, in another unprecedented move, Joe Biden came out to give a speech. Never been done before like that.   Then a couple hours later in Wisconsin and Michigan, we saw 100% drops.
1325386139671334913 2020-11-08 18:34:14 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself Well, it strongly suggested itself to me when a series of unprecedented events happened on election night.   See, I knew the ballots were wrong. I have been following @Peoples_Pundit and @Barnes_Law so we had solid evidence of the shy trump voter and the dad joke voter.

1325385263254745088 2020-11-08 18:30:45 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself When and how did the hypothesis become a law?  It was always reality- he merely had insight into that reality.
1325385036896591874 2020-11-08 18:29:51 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself Right- I need more data.  I get that.  Probably the wrong frame, since I am really seeking a historical event/phenomenon.  In that sense, it's not a scientific truth I am after.
1325384812216135686 2020-11-08 18:28:58 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself But what I am doing is more akin to contemporary history.
1325384592304590849 2020-11-08 18:28:05 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself I'm glad that Copernicus tested his hypothesis enough that he believed it was a sound theory.
1325384438600130566 2020-11-08 18:27:29 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself So I should only believe strong hypotheses?  I was just responding to your criticism of me. I said I understand that I am currently unable to convince you of my hypothesis. And you said that I should never believe hypotheses.
1325383630915559425 2020-11-08 18:24:16 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself Copernicus had a hypothesis.   Are you saying nobody should believe it?
1325383389688508422 2020-11-08 18:23:19 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself That's a hypothesis that has been proven by the data?  Isn't it?  Yet you said you should never believe a hypothesis. Was Xeno the mathematician wrong in his hypothesis?
1325383133290754049 2020-11-08 18:22:18 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself I'm just saying you should tell that to feminsts because they won't listen to you at all. They are all hypothesis. And they have tenured academic positions. I'm just a blue collar schlubb.
1325382904311111681 2020-11-08 18:21:23 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself So you don't believe the Earth is a sphere?
1325382507035025409 2020-11-08 18:19:48 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself Try telling that to feminists.   That's how they science. They assume that gender is merely a social construct and then build on that.   They have to go back 30 years to figure out they got their hypothesis wrong.
1325382264658735104 2020-11-08 18:18:50 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself It's possible that I, and many others, are also being manipulated. But if so, it is well done. Like CIA level QANON stuff.  So I have to remain skeptical as well.   Either they are sloppy, or they are deliberately manipulating conservatives.
1325381749984137216 2020-11-08 18:16:48 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself Fair enough. I acknowledge that I have been unable to provide the requisite data to convince you of my opinion.   I understand why you remain unconvinced of my hypothesis that there's massive fraud afoot.
1325381424837513216 2020-11-08 18:15:30 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself Truth reveals itself in different ways.  The "truth" we should be most wary of are the twitter factchecks that censor the executive branch of the United States of America.   We should be very skeptical of unelected media *declaring" the presidency.
1325380674010968066 2020-11-08 18:12:31 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself I've read almost all of Socrates dialogues.  I have read everything by dostoyevsky.   We all have bias. I don't think you know mine.
1325380359308136448 2020-11-08 18:11:16 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself So you haven't watched Rogan and Sam Harris?  Or Rogan and Jack Dorsey?  Or Rogan and Alex jones?  Or Rogan and Douglas Murray.  Almost the entire IDW has been on that show. Some multiple times.
1325380030168494080 2020-11-08 18:09:58 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself Yes and no. The problem with so much news is that they take what is handed to them by government and repeate verbatim.   Tim Pool is great. Many other smaller that are good.   But the big news is about directing opinion, not giving data.
1325379143526191105 2020-11-08 18:06:26 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself Call me naive but I still trust C-span. I enjoyed the big tech senate hearings.
1325378902307508224 2020-11-08 18:05:29 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself I find individual bloggers to be the best source of information.  I don't trust Fox/SKY although even a broken clock is right twice a day.  But in Trumptime, CNN and MSNBC are on a 24 hour cycle rage manufacturing spree.  I prefer Rogan. But many other smaller vloggers.
1325378420155572227 2020-11-08 18:03:34 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself They sent out ten million ballot request forms in Pennsylvania   and many more millions in other states sent to inactive and dead voters.   That provides cover. The actual how of the fraud is not clear to me.
1325378011844251648 2020-11-08 18:01:57 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself Well ballot harvesting is legal in California.  But you're right, I don't know the exact method. However, I understand the purpose of ten million ballot requests in Pennsylvania- cover for the massively increased turnout.   And 100% drops for Biden on CNN and other stations.
1325377067270238209 2020-11-08 17:58:11 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself Am I out of line to say that I see the media manufacture outrage literally everday?

1325376427882115072 2020-11-08 17:55:39 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MsbCreative @Tempaest @neilhimself They wanted additional funding for their mail in ballot harvesting scheme and the president said no. What's the problem?

1325366454355718144 2020-11-08 17:16:01 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @sherwood_de The fact that the garbage with possible ballots is not in a dumpster but in bushes seems kinda suspicious to me.   But not enough context.

That guy is probably a poll worker who knew where they put the garbage. They are hoping to find evidence of fraud.

1325282424725647360 2020-11-08 11:42:07 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Bill_Kezos The Regime appointed Biden and made it look like he won the election

Even before, absentee ballots accounted for the largest contingent of fraud but they were only one percent.  Who decided to stop the count Tuesday night?

I've seen plenty accused of rape that were innocent. But innocence is no defense against an accusation in this environment.   Same thing with racism. An accusation equals guilt.

1325173846429720576 2020-11-08 04:30:40 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MissyPhi They'd be happy but not sharing champagne in the streets.   Now we wait to see who they decide to turn their hate engine on next.

1325172486531665921 2020-11-08 04:25:15 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MissyPhi To be honest, I don't think Trump voters would have been that happy with a win.

1325171265733353472 2020-11-08 04:20:24 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @melliflora One of the tests that the U.N. supervisors uses to check for election fraud is if there's a lot of votes for the top candidate and not downballot.  The argument you're making is not a strong one.

1325154933247602690 2020-11-08 03:15:30 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @AndrewYang The real concern is the damage that mass mail-in voting has done to the integrity of our elections.  We need legislation to ensure fairness now.   Every country that has used mass mail in voting has banned it due to widespread fraud, except the USA.   https://t.co/ytKmo7RBd4
1325153593679376384 2020-11-08 03:10:11 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @holleighlama @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump Make sure you have the facts and not just the opinion that the MSM assigned to you.

1325146949851344899 2020-11-08 02:43:47 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @BenWinegard Mass mail in ballots without ID  Russia banned it. France banned it. UK banned it.  Every country that has tried it has found mass fraud, USA included.   Wait for the evidence to come out.    https://t.co/ytKmo7RBd4
1325146372966899712 2020-11-08 02:41:30 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @mtracey Prediction: The hate machine will pick a new target and become even stronger than before.
1325145710128345088 2020-11-08 02:38:51 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @namita_purohit @robbystarbuck Not yet. That is why I have not accepted the results yet.  The fact that they are pushing this through so haphazardly makes me more suspicious. EvenAl Gore was given until December to make his case.
1325145139900280832 2020-11-08 02:36:36 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @namita_purohit @robbystarbuck After the vote audit, I am quite happy to accept the results.
1325142808030687234 2020-11-08 02:27:20 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @IonaItalia So naive. You didn't read about the Burisma deal at all did you?  I'm not saying whose worse. And I get why people voted for him. But his corruption is about as well established as it can be when it's counter mainstream media narrative.
1325142252948086784 2020-11-08 02:25:07 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Cernovich The problem is that if we continue to allow mass mail in voting without ID's then the same results will happen.
1325141409561792512 2020-11-08 02:21:46 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Cernovich This is my biggest takeaway. The realpolitik is that the media chooses the president from now on.  New York Times deleted this tweet but it shows exactly how it works:  https://t.co/9ks0D5fH0R
1325141165029593088 2020-11-08 02:20:48 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @marklevinshow @lily04022018 They deleted the tweet. But the media sees themselves as the ones who choose the president, not the constitution.  https://t.co/cyLO0OumD4
1325140828021424128 2020-11-08 02:19:27 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @robbystarbuck Never forget, they deleted the tweet, but this is the reality of  power in the country.  https://t.co/bqD9h26dtc

1325137411903545344 2020-11-08 02:05:53 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CHSommers The real lesson to learn is that the tech/media establishment is real power in government.  They say who wins.
1325137159163097088 2020-11-08 02:04:53 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CHSommers Disagree. If they were fair we would wait for the legal challenges before declaring victory.  This is causing permanent damge to our trust in election integrity.

1325135601494970369 2020-11-08 01:58:41 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Soulphood @HiawathaKaplunk @SwipeWright Massive fraud happened in the UK when they tried mass mail ballots without ID.  Look up France, massive mail in ballot fraud before they banned it.  Russia same.  Why would mass mail ballots be different in the USA?  The thinking is... because Trump said it must be false.
1325134491430629380 2020-11-08 01:54:17 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Yascha_Mounk They call it on television and then quickly publish dozens of stories saying it is so.  Next time, we can just skip the election altogether.
1325134120842825730 2020-11-08 01:52:48 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @redpillmuslim @Cernovich Trump saw a rise in Muslim american voter support in 2020

1325133607774556160 2020-11-08 01:50:46 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Yascha_Mounk My hypothesis is that Trump was merely an outsider with foot-in-mouth disease but it was the media hate machine that drove the frenzy.  To test this hypothesis let's see how long before the media picks a new hate target.
1325133027102568449 2020-11-08 01:48:28 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @ScottGreenfield One thing we have learned is that the true authority in this country stems from the media/tech oligarchy. They choose the President even in disputed/irregular elections.
1325132537505738752 2020-11-08 01:46:31 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Yascha_Mounk Wait. Do the networks have the legal authority to call a disputed and irregular election or merely the unmitigated power to do so?
1325131858313666560 2020-11-08 01:43:49 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @mtracey Regardless of who wins, the electoral process must have integrity.  When the big/tech media monopoly force it, it shows the opposite.   What are they afraid of that they must force the issue?
1325131385992929280 2020-11-08 01:41:56 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @mtracey Except it's  not the same. There's a reason why mass mail in ballots without ID are banned in every civilized country. It inevitably leads to fraud.  A vote must be more than a piece of paper. Somebody must willingly cast it in their own name.
1325125986539614209 2020-11-08 01:20:29 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @JeffreyGoldberg @Yascha_Mounk So the media is the authority, not the constitution?
1325125115508527104 2020-11-08 01:17:01 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @robertwrighter @CHSommers The lesson to be learned is that power doesn't reside with the President, the people, or the election process but rather with the media.  Ex cathedra.
1325124175233769477 2020-11-08 01:13:17 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @SamHarrisOrg Mass mail-in ballots without ID are banned in every country that has ever used them because of widespread fraud.  Russia. Brazil. France. UK.
1325123933214023680 2020-11-08 01:12:19 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @EPoe187 My hypothesis is that 90% of the hatred was artificially induced by the media.  To test this hypothesis let's see how long it takes for the media to turn the next guy into a monster.

1325115735358763009 2020-11-08 00:39:45 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @EPoe187 I can accept a loss. I cannot accept that we continue to use this flawed process of mail in ballots without ID.  It damages democracy

1324849097128529922 2020-11-07 07:00:13 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NanHayworth I would rather lose the election than compromise its integrity.  If we don't have a fair election we don't have a country!

1324848277129465858 2020-11-07 06:56:58 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NanHayworth Democrats plan to assassinate a member of SCOTUS???
1324847902527807489 2020-11-07 06:55:29 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @BenDizik @ConceptualJames I meant you. I was responding to you.   I respect Sam but the integrity of the ballot box is far higher than his annoyance at a politician.
1324847048424857604 2020-11-07 06:52:05 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @BenDizik @ConceptualJames You want to punish people because the politician they voted for says bullshit?  Newsflash: that's every politician

Then you process the ballots for inactive voters. You never mail out the ballot, you put it through the machine.  Works great in a large urban center.
1324845414181425157 2020-11-07 06:45:35 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RugbyChris1 @Tryfan_73 @JackPosobiec Lol... in Philly?   No.

With no ID needed, you can just process their ballot.  Easy.  I'd rather lose with election integrity than win without it.

They overplayed their hand.  I guarantee when we audit the ballots we will find dead voters.  At the very least someone sent a ballot.

I can accept Trump is corrupt. So is Biden. But which one does the media tell you about?

1324814858999812098 2020-11-07 04:44:10 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @PureValor @RugbyChris1 @JackPosobiec They'll  put a flimsy fact check on that saying they screen for those but it still doesn't explain the ballots sent in October.

1324810895235624961 2020-11-07 04:28:25 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RugbyChris1 @JackPosobiec There is multiple Observors getting thrown out for disputing ballots.

1324810577475178497 2020-11-07 04:27:10 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> This is getting creepy. Is Ms. Ocasio-Cortez threatening 70 million voters?
1324809553666605056 2020-11-07 04:23:06 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CletusSpangler @RepMattGaetz We better check.
1324809051801329666 2020-11-07 04:21:06 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @GrimEsq @RepMattGaetz Either it's true or not.  If there are dead votes, they should not be counted and we should reform the system so it never happens again.
1324808677908504577 2020-11-07 04:19:37 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RugbyChris1 @JackPosobiec The magic trick is this-  By sending out millions of ballot request forms, large urban centers can easily pad the ballot from their large inactive voter registries.  In a city like Philadelphia or Detroit there's  literally millions of extra votes to be had, no ID needed.
1324808059106066434 2020-11-07 04:17:09 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @EsdeeEsdee1 Did you just assume I was taught to hate people?  I embrace my African roots.  I would ask you to not stereotype me.    Thanks.

1324786961828249600 2020-11-07 02:53:19 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @BicknellAlf @RaheemKassam Just look at total vote turnout in major cities in the contested swing states.  The statistical anomaly alone warrants investigation even before the reported shenanigans of observors being kicked out.

I am trying to sound the alarm that we are not going back to normal from here.  Trust in the electoral process is at nadir.
1324767687210373127 2020-11-07 01:36:44 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @DonnieB09290769 Right. Even more suspicious is that they kept scrutineers out of the polls while they added over a hundred thousand votes.  And it wasn't just in Michigan. Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Atlanta.  I know fraud when I see it.
1324766277827776515 2020-11-07 01:31:08 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @DonnieB09290769 This always happens with mass mail in ballots that only require a signature.  This is why first world countries do not vote this way.  Look at Corsica.

1324758034015494144 2020-11-07 00:58:22 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @kittypurrzog I am not sure people understand that 70 million americans feel cheated and about 35 million are certain they were cheated.  Regardless of what you think, recognize that a wheel just came off the vehicle.
1324757514605498373 2020-11-07 00:56:18 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @HalifaxShadow @QueenOfTheWilis Exactly right

1324691399430885381 2020-11-06 20:33:35 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @AmandaPresto I've been reading about Corsica. Apparently mail in ballots are always like this.   The UK is now requiring voter ID because of six labour MPs busted with mail in ballot fraud.    https://t.co/zdQDMLSq9V

There's multiple indictments for ballot fraud in Philly last year  There's always some fraud in every election.  The question is how much.  For that it's fair to ask for evidence.   It will be coming forthwith. Processing as we speak.

Anderson Cooper said they were going to take a break from the counting and restart in the morning.

More minority vote for a Republican than anyone since 1960  and not a single network caters to that.

1324676759695073281 2020-11-06 19:35:25 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @simoro1 @cain_m8 @SkyNewsAust @annelisenews @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Sure. I am less worried about who wins and more worried about how we re-establish trust in the electoral process.  I would like to see Canadian scrutineers at the recount. Probably won't happen.

That's fair.   ANd it's right to ask for evidence.  so give us time to collect it. That is happening now.

I voted Clinton although I held my nose to do so because I was so mad the Democrats had stolen the primary from Bernie. Blatantly. Debbie Wasserman. Ugh.   But yeah I'm a registered Democrat. I loved Obama. I voted Kerry.

1324634282246180865 2020-11-06 16:46:38 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @TomstoHoboRags @jessesingal but you have plausible deniability up to the that 9 million or whatever ceiling. Just enough to win by a few votes where you need to.
1324634126817906700 2020-11-06 16:46:01 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @TomstoHoboRags @jessesingal You know you can win Pennsylvania, you just need to know how many votes you need. That's when they paused it and started process "mail in ballots" many of which are legit.
1324633742510608384 2020-11-06 16:44:29 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @TomstoHoboRags @jessesingal Absentee ballots are fine. They have been used for years for military and available upon request.   The magic trick is sending out 9 million request ballots. Now you have a smokescreen to create as many votes as you need.   Look up Mexico 1988 elections.

1324628920495386624 2020-11-06 16:25:19 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @OriginalSinVA @Suzyw27936136 @ylith_peck @charliekirk11 There's a reason that mass mail in ballots are mostly banned in Europe and most other OECD countries is because they are *highly* prone to fraud.   Most countries use voter ID's for this very reason.  This reminds me of Mexico's 1988 election, which later was discovered stolen.
1324628239004872704 2020-11-06 16:22:37 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @EmperorCuck The lines have shifted due to the rise of the New Left. In fact, I don't find the one or even two dimensional political graphs at all useful.

1324626275496022016 2020-11-06 16:14:49 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @EmperorCuck It's clear voter fraud. I don't care who wins or loses but this is a Weimar moment. This was planned. The fix was in. It's pretty blatant.    https://t.co/ytKmo7A0lw

1324616955274428417 2020-11-06 15:37:46 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @SkyNewsAust @mirandadevine Apparently mass mail in ballots are highly prone to fraud and are banned in most civilized countries around the world.  Who knew?   https://t.co/ytKmo7A0lw

1324616394286288896 2020-11-06 15:35:33 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @HiawathaKaplunk @MAJTOURE It's much harder. IT makes it easy for major urban areas to vote on behalf of their inactive voter registries.

It's a magic trick:  Mail out millions of unsolicited ballot requests, and then you have cover to create ballots from your inactive voter registries in major urban areas.  AS you, see, new votes are being created by the hour in every one of these states.
1324609643704913921 2020-11-06 15:08:43 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @nypost There's probably a few more ballots in the inactive registy of Philadelphia that they can scrape.

1324607773649362951 2020-11-06 15:01:17 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @SomeBitchIKnow I just found this paper explaining why mass mail in ballots are banned in many many countries- because of fraud.    https://t.co/ytKmo7A0lw
1324607098135732225 2020-11-06 14:58:36 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @ken_duda @MAJTOURE Usually with stipulations- with voter id, or because of health.  Essentially we had the same thing here, called absentee ballots upon request. Often used by military.   But widescale mass mail in ballots without voter ID is a recipe for fraud.
1324604614839308288 2020-11-06 14:48:44 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @kittypurrzog So I just found this paper that explains why mass mail in ballots are banned in Europe, Russia, Brazil and elsewhere-  apparently it's highly susceptible to fraud.    https://t.co/ytKmo7A0lw
1324603302550581249 2020-11-06 14:43:31 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @TomstoHoboRags @jessesingal This election, all the states used it.   And this is the first time for about 37 of them.   The evidence of fraud is coming in as we speak.

I was just reading about the history of mass mail in ballots.  Turns out there is a reason it's banned by nearly every civilized nation in the world- it's highly prone to fraud.    https://t.co/ytKmo7A0lw

Almost every country in Europe has banned mass mail in ballots.   Russia, Brazil, many others. It's obviously prone to fraud.  Most countries also require ID.    https://t.co/ytKmo7A0lw

This paper shows why most countries in the world have banned the mass mail in ballot system we just used for the first time.     https://t.co/ytKmo7A0lw
1324598952839315458 2020-11-06 14:26:14 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MAJTOURE To me this isn't about who wins, it's about the integrity of our elections.  It turns out that most countries have banned mass mail in ballot for one very good reason, they are highly prone to fraudulence.   https://t.co/ytKmo7A0lw

1324597799317590016 2020-11-06 14:21:39 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @nypost So they banned Kathy Griffith as well then, right?
1324597565799673856 2020-11-06 14:20:44 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @TomstoHoboRags @jessesingal There's a reason why mass mail in ballots are banned by nearly every first world country.  They are highly vulnerable to fraud.    https://t.co/ytKmo7A0lw

1324597103885246466 2020-11-06 14:18:54 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Michael10plus10 @ColeTrain_318 @jmatthews1065 @MattWalshBlog @seanmdav Well mail in ballots are infamous for fraud.

1324594840953364483 2020-11-06 14:09:54 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @ken_duda @MAJTOURE That's actually not much of a concern because it's harder to do in rural areas.  The trick is done in major cities:  Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Detroit, Philadelphia, Atlanta.   Millions of inactive voters.
1324594509322297344 2020-11-06 14:08:35 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @ken_duda @MAJTOURE It's a magic trick.   You send out millions of unsolicited ballot requests.  Then you manufacture votes from your inactive voter registry in major urban centers.   Voila! You just won a free election.
1324594158078693376 2020-11-06 14:07:11 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @ken_duda @MAJTOURE what do you mean by "secret ballot?"  We are talking about mail in ballots.  Most civilized countries ban them for obvious reasons.
1324593927941509121 2020-11-06 14:06:16 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @ken_duda @MAJTOURE Among the 27 countries in the European Union, 63% ban mail-in absentee voting unless living abroad and another 22% require a photo-ID to obtain a mail-in absentee ballot. Twenty-two percent ban the practice even for those who live abroad.
1324593853484204032 2020-11-06 14:05:59 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @ken_duda @MAJTOURE Brazil and Russia satisfy the economic standards of the OECD, but are excluded for various political reasons. Both countries completely ban mail-in voting and require photo-IDs for inperson voting.
1324592898487320577 2020-11-06 14:02:11 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @realchrisrufo "voter fraud is exceedingly rare" is one of those assertions that is made on faith, like "only 2% of rape accusations are false."  Maybe it was true at some point, not this year.
1324590180200812544 2020-11-06 13:51:23 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Hail__To_You @RoadHomeQuiltn @Outsideness And mail in ballots. Apparently there's a reason most countries don't use them.   https://t.co/ytKmo7A0lw
1324589295953453057 2020-11-06 13:47:52 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @BIast_Off @jessesingal No, that's why you do it in your major urban county with millions of inactive voters on your rolls.

1324587422869524480 2020-11-06 13:40:25 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @ken_duda @MAJTOURE In the meantime, there's a reason why most countries that have tried mail in voting later banned it.   https://t.co/ytKmo7A0lw

1324586022139764736 2020-11-06 13:34:51 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @BIast_Off @jessesingal Why would it require so many actors?
1324585796012224512 2020-11-06 13:33:58 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @BIast_Off @jessesingal Sure, I get the argument for it.   It just enables a ton of fraud.
1324584754461745154 2020-11-06 13:29:49 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @ken_duda @MAJTOURE Processing. That's a valid ask. We have lots of anecdotal evidence but have to process it.

1324583404529160194 2020-11-06 13:24:27 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @BIast_Off @jessesingal But then you could just let them request an absentee ballot which is how it always used to be done.  Sending out millions of unsolicited ballot requests gives you  cover. A kind of plausible deniability.
1324582473720881153 2020-11-06 13:20:45 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @wgwhite2 @jessesingal It's a magic trick. They've been doing it for years just not at this scale.
1324582346205601792 2020-11-06 13:20:15 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @wgwhite2 @jessesingal Now in Philadelphia you literally have millions and millions of "voters" on your inactive ballot rolls.  1. pause the initial vote count once you know your goal  2. need to obfuscate or obscure your activity from the other party  3. push through inactive voter ballots
1324580816660369409 2020-11-06 13:14:10 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @jessesingal If you wanted to commit fraud though, the smartest thing you could do weeks before the election is send out millions of unsolicited ballot requests .
1324577724976058369 2020-11-06 13:01:53 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @DystOptimist @EricRWeinstein Right, but now remember that you don't really get to vote on any of it.

1324574708302516227 2020-11-06 12:49:54 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @DystOptimist @EricRWeinstein However, having seen it, I realize we don't live in a democracy but corportate media/tech oligarchy which fixes the votes and censors me when I complain.  This is bad.
1324567075944321028 2020-11-06 12:19:34 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @TomstoHoboRags @jessesingal This is bigger than trump or biden. If we don't address this fraud we no longer live in a representative republic.  If they get away with mass fraud with the election this is no longer a democracy.
1324565800020254720 2020-11-06 12:14:30 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @TomstoHoboRags @jessesingal Agreed. By the democrat establishment that has spied on Trump since before he was in office and the media/tech oligarchy.  Looks like Civil war frankly.
1324563693250748417 2020-11-06 12:06:08 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @TomstoHoboRags @jessesingal Are they undermining an election or have these mail in ballots allowed for mass instances of fraud in multiple states?
1324551710161907713 2020-11-06 11:18:31 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @jessesingal How are they any worse than mainstream media in that regard?

1324547924223811584 2020-11-06 11:03:28 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CaptainMelToxic @jessesingal I think that is exactlt what is happening. Meanwhile Twitter is censoring the executive branch
1324547401676427264 2020-11-06 11:01:24 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CaptainMelToxic @jessesingal Isn't that what is happening? Most importantly however, the rules in Philadelphia have already been broken
1324546920916881409 2020-11-06 10:59:29 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CaptainMelToxic @jessesingal I don't care for trump but if we allow them to cheat a vote then we no longer live in a representative republic.

There's lots of evidence you just aren't looking for it.  3. People who talk about "vote suppression" generally like loosy-goosy rules to help voter fraud.  https://t.co/0FUR0G1II3

We know the democrats committed fraud in both of their last primaries.  We know third world countries don't use mail in ballots because of the high potential for fraud
1324544908485664772 2020-11-06 10:51:29 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CaptainMelToxic @jessesingal Wait you think it's okay what Philadelphia is doing?

Your reliance on *authority* from the media/tech oligarchy is ridiculous

It's not just a non substantive argument, it's relying on nebulous authority.

But i have watched a great many elections and what happened tuesday was unreal.  I hope I am wrong. But we know there were multiple indictments for voter fraud in Philadelphia last year.

Did it not seem abnormal to you that we stopped counting votes in an unprecedented move and then Biden gave an unprecedented speech and suddenly hundreds of thousands of ballots dropped for Biden in MI and WI?

1324242248926744577 2020-11-05 14:48:50 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @kristof_saye No. That didn't happen. Just a slow night for media networks and they aren't allowed to cover antifa.   there were some conservatives that said a prayer and had gathered to hear the vote count.   You can watch the livestream. CNN just got bored and did what CNN does.

1324229419947429895 2020-11-05 13:57:51 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @PpollingNumbers @FoxNews This reminds me of the situation Trump was in before the vote count, in an unprecedented move, were allegedly stopped until 10am the next morning.   At 4am, mass ballots came in stacks of 100% Biden in Wisconsin and Michigan to the tunes of hundreds of thousands.
1324226813183303680 2020-11-05 13:47:29 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @DeuxGraham @TheJordanRachel Trump was winning in 6 states. Suddenly everyone decided at once to stop counting the votes.   Biden, in a completely unprecedented move this century, came out and gave a speech.  We were told ballot counting would resume at 10am  At 4am, hundreds of thousands of votes appeared.
1324225732562853888 2020-11-05 13:43:12 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @TheJordanRachel @NanHayworth Stopping and exposing this fraud is more important to me than who wins.  This is the end of the Republic.
1324224472551968768 2020-11-05 13:38:11 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NunesAlt @RT_com There seems to be discrepancies in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Some districts appear to have more votes than registered voters.
1324221569770655744 2020-11-05 13:26:39 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MisterKenny @PpollingNumbers They are piling in dead voters as fast as they can in Philadelphia since the Republicans can't really observe or stop them.
1324221119646306304 2020-11-05 13:24:52 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @michaelshermer I would gladly have Biden as president if it meant addressing and providing solutions to fraud such a ballot harvesting and mail in ballots from urban inactive registries.   It's the fraud and the people who have engaged in it on a large scale that concerns me most.

1324166342321328136 2020-11-05 09:47:12 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @cornbreadboii @mtracey Wouldn't we need to establish that the fishy ballot drops in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania are legit?
1324166126306238464 2020-11-05 09:46:20 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @onedozenthings @LisaMarieBoothe Not if they do mail in ballots again.
1324165817957781504 2020-11-05 09:45:07 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @mtracey It happened while voters were still in line?
1324165373156069382 2020-11-05 09:43:21 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @cornbreadboii @mtracey He was winning in six states until every major news outlet suddenly declared a pause to vote counting until 10am the next day.  Between 4&amp;5 am Hundreds of thousands of ballots dropped in Wisconsin and Michigan. All for Biden.
1324164295513563141 2020-11-05 09:39:04 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RadicalLib @Oneiorosgrip Another detail is the Chinese Yuan crashing just before all major news media agreed we would pause the vote until 10 AM the next day.  Between 4 and 5 AM Biden pulled ahead in Michigan and Wisconsin.

1324149067111346180 2020-11-05 08:38:33 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @BenWinegard Prediction- every election in the future will showcase over 90% voter mail-in ballot turnout in every major US city.
1324148480366039041 2020-11-05 08:36:13 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MarkAmesExiled Also voter participation in every urban area for every future election with mail-in ballots will be over 90% from now on...
1324148004513865729 2020-11-05 08:34:20 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @GreenwoodOutlaw My prediction- voter participation is going to go up to 90% for every major city in the USA and never come back down. They've cracked the code.
1324147700200361985 2020-11-05 08:33:07 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Debatedonthate1 @ToomeyWright Yeah but the tech/media oligarchy is too powerful. Watch Google start burying search results into this fraud.  Twitter is already silencing the President for basically calling it out.

1324145397569409028 2020-11-05 08:23:58 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @ashleigh_zc I see. the "burn it all down" type.
1324144272954871814 2020-11-05 08:19:30 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @ashleigh_zc Double check your bias. I know you want to win, but is it worth it if it means we no longer have a democratic system?
1324143195572326400 2020-11-05 08:15:13 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @GreenwoodOutlaw In the past 24 hours I have come to understand that I don't live in a democracy but a tech/media oligarchy where they just harvest the ballots they need to win.   And the magic trick works because they've led us to believe this is exactly the kind of thing that Trump would do.
1324140942618697732 2020-11-05 08:06:16 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @arpitrage @StephanLuck Twitter's unrestricted power of censorship?

1324136099850178566 2020-11-05 07:47:02 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Midgard8_3 I am fairly certain I understand the magic trick.  Millions of unsolicited mail in ballots...  plus urban Democrat registries  means virtually unlimited last moment votes in key swing states.

1324123080701128711 2020-11-05 06:55:18 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @jim_newell @jessesingal It's  all Trump's fault. Pay no attention to the establishment behind the curtain fixing exactly the right number of votes in 6 states with sudden unexpected record breaking "turn out" of mail ballots at never before seen levels of voter "participation."
1324122386418094080 2020-11-05 06:52:32 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @monetxchange @LeftistsAreScum The outgroup of the blue team is the red team.

1324120519042600967 2020-11-05 06:45:07 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @jessesingal Who made the call to pause vote counting and resume it at 10am the next morning?  Who made the call to suddenly count hundreds of thousands of urban mail-in ballots at 4am?
1324119983065042945 2020-11-05 06:42:59 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @jessesingal "turnout"
1324119885874606086 2020-11-05 06:42:36 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @jessesingal 1.) Mail out millions of unsolicited ballots  2.) Wait for red team to finish running up the scoreboard. Then pause the vote counting.  3.) Figure out precisely how many ballots you need from your major urban registries.   4.) Win by unexpected turnout in the states you need.

1324112159928995841 2020-11-05 06:11:54 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @SamHarrisOrg Are you concerned with voter fraud?  Please take a close, hard look. This looks like voter fraud... starting with the genius idea to mail out millions of unsolicited ballots.

Then those same ballots magically reappear in stacks of a 100,000 all for Biden. Those people are just on the registry, but they never actually signed their names.
1324109501520400393 2020-11-05 06:01:20 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @JohnFMiller86 @jessesingal Fox is controlled opposition.

1324075720327483392 2020-11-05 03:47:06 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NateSilver538 Not true. The official secretary of state election count in Michigan shows Trump up by 200,000 in Michigan.

1324063824480272388 2020-11-05 02:59:50 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @DiegoATLAW @ATabarrok No. Black, Hispanic and women voters substantially increased for trump in 2020. Only white men voted for Trump less than in 2016.
1324063102313353218 2020-11-05 02:56:58 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @RubinReport @glennbeck In fact, Silver exiled Trafalgar who was the closest to getting it right.

1324058930478305286 2020-11-05 02:40:23 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @thececilcharles More like, how did we lose Latinx voters?  (over 90% of latino voters don't use "latinx.")

1324058262002688000 2020-11-05 02:37:44 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @johngarcia2490 @PpollingNumbers @Data_Orbital Election day votes favor red 2-1.  This is what voter suppression looks like:  calling a state while people are still voting.

1324057236566609921 2020-11-05 02:33:39 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @nguyenthevote Does that account for deaths and people who moved?
1324056753902936065 2020-11-05 02:31:44 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @MoveOn @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @Twitter can you please add context to this tweet?  Or is that for conservative voices only?
1324055488259104768 2020-11-05 02:26:42 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @kstraith @RichLowry Right but the actual vote count is closer than 0.5% of the total vote.
1324052465122267146 2020-11-05 02:14:42 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @saucissonsec @paulkrugman Good point, there's even greater support among the black community than the exit polls showed- which was 17% of black men.  The highest since 1960.
1324051231321501705 2020-11-05 02:09:47 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @saucissonsec @paulkrugman White male voter was down for Trump, black hispanic and women voters up.
1324050715627659265 2020-11-05 02:07:44 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @kstraith @RichLowry So they violated their own policy since the margin in Arizona is less than that. Again, legal ramifications.
1324049870248955905 2020-11-05 02:04:23 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @kstraith @RichLowry But calling a state with voters still in line to the polls surely has legal ramifications?

1324012197538865156 2020-11-04 23:34:41 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Spydude43 It's easiest to do in urban areas. It's  called ballot harvesting. You mail out unsolicited ballots. Then you check millions of inactive voters in urban registry. You can safely harvest hundreds of thousands of votes.

If the only data you have about false rape accusations is from years BEFORE the #metoo movement...  then you effectively have zero valid data on false rape accusations and their prevalence.

1323908135518687240 2020-11-04 16:41:11 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @TomBevanRCP @MZHemingway The trick is there is no cut off date to continually receive absentee ballots without postmark or matching signatures.

The point is, we should treat a woman's testimony equal to a man's but not more than a man's. Everybody gets due process. Everybody deserves a chance to defend themselves.

The issue was that women were required to have an average of 4 kids in order for their tribe not to go extinct.

1323753556546113537 2020-11-04 06:26:56 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @EllieStitches @CSMFHT Eyewitness testimony is the least reliable form of evidence.  The FBI shows that 1 in 4 rapekits exclude the primary suspect as identified by the alleged victim.

1321854774321569792 2020-10-30 00:41:51 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @nickcatelli To be fair, they will burn the country down regardless. In fact, they are already in progress.
1321852454338727937 2020-10-30 00:32:38 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @HawleyMO @Twitter Surely we can have a variety of opinions about the efficacy of walls without Twitter banning state officials?
1321848592336855040 2020-10-30 00:17:17 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @kittypurrzog There were multiple indictments for voter fraud in Philadelphia last year.  I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for the election to be held on election day.
1321847318593835010 2020-10-30 00:12:14 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @larabazelon There's reason for concern due to multiple indictments for voter fraud in Philadelphia last year.
1321846361374031873 2020-10-30 00:08:25 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @erinnthered @Johnny_Joey @DavidAFrench There were multiple indictments for voter fraud in Philadelphia last year.
1321733325753589763 2020-10-29 16:39:16 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @keith3048 How many months after the election should you be allowed to vote?  What's the cut off date?
1321712777233371142 2020-10-29 15:17:36 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CSMFHT I rest my case.
1321712292166291461 2020-10-29 15:15:41 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CSMFHT Exactly.
1321710514779660294 2020-10-29 15:08:37 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> Hahaha!
1321708996181565441 2020-10-29 15:02:35 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @CSMFHT Florida same. There's no community transmission if you don't use contact tracing.  https://t.co/twfBzsmA2B
1321703801468952576 2020-10-29 14:41:56 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @jack The human arbiters may not have enough diversity of viewpoint and/or epistemology.   Also, I had an anonymous account suspended because I shared the NY Post article. (Or so I assume since it happened on the same day.)
1321688088884744192 2020-10-29 13:39:30 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @Oneiorosgrip According to The Daily Beast, ‘Nearly 10 percent of the unverified accounts retweeted by President Trump since his inauguration are currently suspended from Twitter for various violations of the platform’s policies.'”

1321513302183284736 2020-10-29 02:04:58 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @JayashreeNara14 @thehill The same was true for AT&amp;T and American Steel.
1321486877342531584 2020-10-29 00:19:58 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @DanJosephsG @NateSilver538 @Peoples_Pundit At first Blue was up 2.5%.  After debate it is tied.
1321483989006372864 2020-10-29 00:08:29 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @NateSilver538 Richard Baris from @Peoples_Pundit is tracking Pennsylvania. Check him out. He nailed 2016 and 2018.

1321269815995207682 2020-10-28 09:57:26 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @OCunasa @HPluckrose @nypost They are examples of monopolies that were broken up.
1321268750352588807 2020-10-28 09:53:12 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @jemlainey @HPluckrose I've noticed.   #BLM is the new colonialism.
1321268235812167681 2020-10-28 09:51:10 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @OCunasa @HPluckrose @nypost Just like American Steel and AT&amp;T right?
1321266537739804675 2020-10-28 09:44:25 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @OCunasa @HPluckrose So you oppose Twitter's suspension of the @nypost?
1321265360801308673 2020-10-28 09:39:44 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @OCunasa @HPluckrose Both. They both have skin in the game, according to your standard.
1321262783518957568 2020-10-28 09:29:30 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @OCunasa @HPluckrose So Russia is vindicated in their interest?
1321228066425868288 2020-10-28 07:11:32 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @JohnRSamuelsen We saw similar with early Covid reporting. Monday would always be low in new cases, with a bump on Tuesday. Seems like a normal effect of Sunday no reporting, whether with ballots or with covid cases.
1321176505825873920 2020-10-28 03:46:39 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @jennyjupite @athein1 Only 2% of those called for polls pick up. Which means most phone surveys are not randomized samples.  The problem is only worse since 2016.
1321175718181720066 2020-10-28 03:43:32 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @yesREALLYyes @Victimless12 @OCunasa @HPluckrose But someone in another country might have divergent interests from a US citizen in who is President.
1321152715959996417 2020-10-28 02:12:07 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @HPluckrose Touché.  Evenso, I retain my grain of salt.
1321151321173536769 2020-10-28 02:06:35 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @HPluckrose Helen- I appreciate your liberalism but I take your opinion of the US election with a grain of salt since you have no skin in the game.
1321146265544044545 2020-10-28 01:46:30 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @andysignore @Karantov Do we have evidence of this?
1321146014800220162 2020-10-28 01:45:30 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @andysignore I think the concern is with ballots allowed after election day without post date or matching signature...  even third world countries don't allow that...   but Pennsylvania does.
1320914797190434818 2020-10-27 10:26:43 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @neilhimself Sigh. Let me believe it's real.
1320855406105796615 2020-10-27 06:30:43 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @KristinBoymom I for one love it when royalty lectures me on my privilege.

1320537611929325568 2020-10-26 09:27:55 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @ZodiacKodiak Florida's red because of new Cuban and Venezuelan Americans.

1320289781486673920 2020-10-25 17:03:08 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @redsonic20 @JohnRSamuelsen I'm thinking of Arizona. Oops.
1320259963676205056 2020-10-25 15:04:39 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @YouknowTheguy3 @LynnIsOverIt @Garrett_Archer How do they know how they voted? I am pretty sure they haven't started counting yet in Florida.
1320255878419841024 2020-10-25 14:48:25 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> @JohnRSamuelsen Of course, it makes sense to have a higher young person turnout with marijuana on the ballot. I wouldn't think that demographic would vote much for Trump.
1316630301892923392 2020-10-15 14:41:40 +0800 <Zachariahskylab> If we can just make it to 2021 maybe it will get better.  https://t.co/7qYUm4qUwf
