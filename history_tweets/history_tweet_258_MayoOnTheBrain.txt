1343414584837873664 2020-12-28 12:32:51 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @dgonzales1990 My twins are currently fighting over their favorite new toy, "block on a string" (patent pending). It is literally a shoelace tied to a lego duplo.
1342944934572171264 2020-12-27 05:26:37 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @DrHayeLo Thank you for such kind words! They have brought us so much joy this year, especially during this holiday season❤️
1342944092007800832 2020-12-27 05:23:16 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @E_AppiahKusi Thank you! I think "squeeze those cheeks" is more common in the US...so while the specifics are a bit different, it seems that there is a general consensus that cheeks are a fair target😂
1342823452256964609 2020-12-26 21:23:54 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @Flagel_Lab Thank you Shelly! I hope you and your family are enjoying the holidays!
1342642470199427075 2020-12-26 09:24:44 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> Our first Christmas as a family of four 🎄 #Christmas2020   (Not shown: the 400 tries it took to get everyone looking in the same general direction. No idea how people do this on a regular basis)  https://t.co/lTbP5NIFty
1342634497657896961 2020-12-26 08:53:03 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @ConnorHaggarty I hope you had a great holiday with your family! 🤗
1340372926739132417 2020-12-20 03:06:23 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> CONGRATS to my (twitterless) sister Alex who got her MSW from @UMich School of Social Work today while solo-parent a 1-year-old foster child during a global pandemic.   She may be my baby sister, but there is no one I look up to more ❤  https://t.co/RSAjN6jsG5
1340133145320906753 2020-12-19 11:13:34 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @TheDavidJMarcus I'm from a place where camouflage prom (or even wedding) dresses are a thing, so I feel like I came out relatively unscathed, considering
1340115565063491586 2020-12-19 10:03:43 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @TheDavidJMarcus I went hunting on a date in high school and shot a goose but an owl swooped down at me while were walking back so I threw the goose at it and ran away.  I feel like there's a moral to this story, but basically it's just made me wary of birds for my whole adult life 🤷‍♀️
1339963840637890564 2020-12-19 00:00:49 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @DrJKhokhar @JKhokharLab @rftyndale Congrats, Jibran! Such a fantastic achievement

1339589560683020290 2020-12-17 23:13:34 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @OfMiceAndMinds Yes, this is so true! I definitely want to highlight exactly WHY we have these ethical regulations in place, and how the early studies (which violated these regulations, had they existed) still have lasting effects now. Thank you for your suggestion!
1339579236177342467 2020-12-17 22:32:32 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> Next semester I'm teaching a new upper level bachelor's course on clinical trial design. I'm hoping to make it interesting and interactive and would welcome any/all suggestions! #AcademicTwitter #sciencetwitter #clinicaltrials

Our small community has been hit especially hard lately and this is a welcome relief. I hope my friends and family back home take advantage of this opportunity 🙏  https://t.co/cn60Etrtyf

1338501573543157761 2020-12-14 23:10:17 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @KarenMSmith_bio Exactly what I was aiming for 😂

1338226753068785664 2020-12-14 04:58:15 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @anandgururajan Well all need a little comic relief 🤷‍♀️😄
1338226579567206407 2020-12-14 04:57:34 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @kalvina0308 I totally agree...but not sure she does lol
1338226334686961664 2020-12-14 04:56:35 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @DemidenkoMI This is a peak parenting moment for me this far 😂
1338217067728809987 2020-12-14 04:19:46 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> Looks like there's a bit of room to grow into the snowsuit, but that look of disapproval fits perfectly 👌 😂  https://t.co/7YGCBwSB0W

1337104559194435585 2020-12-11 02:39:03 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @ahmari_lab @JMurph22RC Looking forward to it!! And thank YOU so much for all the work you and your team put in!

1337019937005723649 2020-12-10 21:02:48 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @erings7 I know, I really can't even be mad about it 🤷‍♀️😂
1336882371262607362 2020-12-10 11:56:10 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @drpaolandmd Thank you 😁
1336882139980247042 2020-12-10 11:55:14 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @canna_brain One person in said photo clearly agrees with you 😒😂
1336870203645431809 2020-12-10 11:07:49 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @NicoleBarbaro I'm still out here asking for the species to be included in the abstract 😑
1336850020608389120 2020-12-10 09:47:37 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> When I not-so-subtly suggest he should change his [incredibly outdated] profile pic....this is what he chooses 😒🙄
1336838039604178944 2020-12-10 09:00:00 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> I was SO impressed w/ the virtual experience at #ACNP2020! It was admittedly tough getting into conference mode while WFH w/ 2 babies (s/o to @JMurph22RC for juggling both so I could try), but it was so well executed!  As nice as it was, really hoping to be IRL in PR next year 🤞
1336791647364018177 2020-12-10 05:55:39 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @NPP_Journal @Heilig_Lab @ACNPorg Thanks so much!

1336778733575950344 2020-12-10 05:04:20 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> I'm very grateful for the opportunity to join @ACNPorg as an associate member, along with so many other great people/scientists! Attending these meetings has been a huge benefit to my development as a scientist over the past few years and I'm excited to get even more involved
1336770042051096579 2020-12-10 04:29:48 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @Flagel_Lab Thanks so much, Shelly! I am very fortunate to have had such supportive mentors along the way, so thank you for all your advice and encouragement! I'm definitely missing our ACNP meetup this year, but hopefully we can make up for it in Puerto Rico next year 🤞

1336518850817429507 2020-12-09 11:51:40 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @ScientificRuvvy @ACNPorg ...to clarify, it was the first time I heard one [from outside my own tribe]
1336516471866986496 2020-12-09 11:42:12 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @ScientificRuvvy @ACNPorg I grew up on a reservation (in Northern MI) and the first time I heard anyone do a land acknowledgment (in any context) was at a conference in Canada a few years ago 😳
1335717032705323010 2020-12-07 06:45:31 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> These girls just hit double digits [in months] and are already too cool to care about mom's photoshoots 😒  https://t.co/vptHU82gWa

1334863759525949442 2020-12-04 22:14:55 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @sirileknes Thank you, Siri! It probably speaks more to my poor prioritization of time than anything, but I'm taking any wins I can get this year 😂
1334352782481108998 2020-12-03 12:24:29 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @LinzyBay Yes! @JMurph22RC is always grilling

1333425097932156928 2020-11-30 22:58:11 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @gaertner_anne Thanks you! I'm so glad you could join/participate! 😀

1332323831197929472 2020-11-27 22:02:09 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> Admittedly, I'm a little sad about missing out on the chance to physically visit @SARIC_Sussex , but I'm still excited for the opportunity to present virtually at the seminar on Monday!  Join in for a sneak peak of we're working on at @CSAN_LiU in both the lab and clinic

1330097325033840640 2020-11-21 18:34:48 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @Flagel_Lab And there are many who are so grateful to you (and @Huda_Akil1) for serving as #FemaleMentors for us!
1329368390402764801 2020-11-19 18:18:17 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> But seriously, I've been mentored by the most incredible women scientists &amp; get to mentor many talented women scientists. The fact that these mentoring relationships should be viewed as sub-optimal bc they don't include a male is very much THE problem in academic science
1329366703290126339 2020-11-19 18:11:35 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> Can't wait to hear their take on how to solve the "leaky pipline" issue of why fewer women (v. men) progress from assistant to full professor.  Probably something like, "if you're a woman, just stop trying to become a full professor" 🙄 #WomenInSTEM #AcademicTwitter #careeradvice

Secretly grateful that conference was postponed 😬 Still no idea how you managed a job talk at 7 weeks after your twins 👏👏👏

1323873370673451010 2020-11-04 14:23:02 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> It's so weird watching the election unfold from outside the US. It is business as usual over here. I have a 6hr zoom seminar soon where I need to try to play it cool because of a mandatory 'camera on' rule. Like that's going to stop me from ugly crying if trump somehow wins.

1313168139434315777 2020-10-06 01:24:16 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> We're still working on proper celebration etiquette, but happy 8 months to these two!  https://t.co/iKQjRwOrr1
1311764998033735683 2020-10-02 04:28:41 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @DrAlister @Bangasser_Lab @NewPI_Slack I feel like that's the best quick fix for now- something that reduces the worry just enough that I don't feel like I'm constantly behind!
1311759476660281352 2020-10-02 04:06:45 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @DrAlister @Bangasser_Lab @NewPI_Slack I'd prefer to but we can't forward emails because we're part of the hospital system 😔
1311693995123388417 2020-10-01 23:46:33 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @ThuHuynhPhD @Bangasser_Lab @NewPI_Slack Outlook and mansplaining are two of my least favorite things, so the combination of the two is just...ugh...😒
1311693619909230592 2020-10-01 23:45:03 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @sirileknes @smbrander @AcademicChatter @NewPI_Slack Somehow I feel better knowing that we're not the only ones with these annoying restrictions
1311693409124585473 2020-10-01 23:44:13 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @sirileknes @smbrander @AcademicChatter @NewPI_Slack @yael_niv Ooh tell me more about this forum! How do I get in? 😁
1311692284803649543 2020-10-01 23:39:45 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @Franklandlab @canna_brain @NewPI_Slack Probably my largest time sink but one that I'm not willing to negotiate on...yet 😂
1311680566165729284 2020-10-01 22:53:11 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @canna_brain @NewPI_Slack Yeah, it definitely looks like I need to implement some structure. My current freestyle method just isn't cutting it
1311673106361135107 2020-10-01 22:23:32 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @Bangasser_Lab @NewPI_Slack I'm a big fan of labels in my gmail account, but we use outlook for work and I dislike it so much that I haven't implemented any sort of system (as some misguided form of protest?). I think it's time to get organized...somehow!
1311660529094545415 2020-10-01 21:33:34 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @DrMatthewLloyd @AcademicChatter @NewPI_Slack Good point - I easily get caught up in answering emails immediately, which throws off my whole schedule. A little structure/discipline should help to prevent that!
1311660189053906950 2020-10-01 21:32:13 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @smbrander @AcademicChatter @NewPI_Slack this was my plan, but my university won't allow slack 🙄we're going to try microsoft teams and hope for the best!
1311649270253211651 2020-10-01 20:48:49 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @Synthia_Guimond @NewPI_Slack This is great! All quite simple to implement but have a clear impact on reducing inbox clutter
1311643391931944965 2020-10-01 20:25:28 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @ConnorHaggarty @cjcascio_phd @NewPI_Slack You mean, "the most importantest of important emails" folder?😉 😂
1311643149899624449 2020-10-01 20:24:30 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @kw_cooper @AcademicChatter @NewPI_Slack Perrrfect, thanks! 👌
1311642784634417152 2020-10-01 20:23:03 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @JSuvilehto @fruce_ki @AcademicChatter @NewPI_Slack I will have to try this, thanks for the suggestion! 😁
1311637158516621313 2020-10-01 20:00:42 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @cjcascio_phd @NewPI_Slack Thank you! This picture alone makes me anxious, but I'm hoping that will dissipate with repeated exposure 😂
1311617613664079872 2020-10-01 18:43:02 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> I have been a new PI for approximately 30 seconds and I already can't handle all the emails.  I really hate having unread emails in my inbox (lol), but I can't keep up. Will I learn to adapt or is this life from now on? I think I need a new strategy  @NewPI_Slack #AcademicChatter
1311166441245356032 2020-09-30 12:50:14 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> I got an email from a predatory journal that chose a 'unique' greeting, and I of course read it in the voice of @Alaska5000    #rupaulsdragrace #ScienceTwitter #AcademicChatter  https://t.co/M8I9Qrftw3

1310817968373235712 2020-09-29 13:45:32 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @Ganjavisst @tomte_skum @Heilig_Lab We will for sure reach out!
1310799222371946496 2020-09-29 12:31:02 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @caromenard666 @EurBehavPharm Thanks so much, Caroline! 😁
1310685949337141248 2020-09-29 05:00:56 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @Ganjavisst @tomte_skum hopefully the science (and medical policy) will soon be available for you to get the treatment that benefits you the most!
1310682390134693889 2020-09-29 04:46:47 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @MarcoVenniro Thanks so much, Marco! I am grateful for the opportunity, but I definitely have big shoes to fill following last year's deserving awardee and entertaining talk! 😉
1310670366092779521 2020-09-29 03:59:01 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @Ganjavisst @tomte_skum Yes, it is a FAAH inhibitor! And you are correct that there is evidence of a relationship between endocannabinoid levels and ASD. In fact, the same compound we are using in our PTSD study is currently being used in a phase 2 clinical trial for ASD ( https://t.co/aZciX4Dnl0)
1310632904817553409 2020-09-29 01:30:09 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @superkash @lvanderschuren @EurBehavPharm Thank you Tom!!
1310620782775672837 2020-09-29 00:41:59 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @ScienceSaoirse @EurBehavPharm Thank you so much!
1310616034777477121 2020-09-29 00:23:07 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @canna_brain @EurBehavPharm Thanks, Matt! I'm always grateful for your support as a colleague and collaborator!

1310569750230114304 2020-09-28 21:19:12 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @MindingtheBrain @EurBehavPharm Thank you, Kim - that's so kind!
1310558260731285504 2020-09-28 20:33:33 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @saadsnagi @EurBehavPharm Thank you, Saad!
1310558142686732288 2020-09-28 20:33:04 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @MAmlung @EurBehavPharm Thank you, Michael! It was so great to get to meet you (back when we could do that IRL) and I hope we get the opportunity to present together again! 😃
1310553888584499200 2020-09-28 20:16:10 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @IM_Meier @EurBehavPharm Thank you Isabell! I hope we get an EBPS reunion next year ;)
1310553792971182081 2020-09-28 20:15:47 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @McreynoldsJayme @EurBehavPharm Thanks so much, Jayme - I really appreciate it!!
1310551873846480896 2020-09-28 20:08:10 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @Flagel_Lab You are too kind, Shelly! I am so grateful for all the advice and guidance over the years. Your continued support means so much!
1310547971533156352 2020-09-28 19:52:39 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @NeuroIP @CSAN_LiU @EurBehavPharm @Heilig_Lab Thank you so much! I'm grateful to have such fantastic colleagues to keep things interesting (and fun!)
1310547388122177536 2020-09-28 19:50:20 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @DrJKhokhar @EurBehavPharm Thank you so much, Jibran!! 😁
1310541998449930242 2020-09-28 19:28:55 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> Incredibly grateful to @EurBehavPharm for the honor &amp; chance to share our work at next years meeting! Using pharmacology to understand behavior was what got me interested in science, so its extra exciting to be among others who appreciate behavior + pharmacology as much as I do😁
1310538105573834757 2020-09-28 19:13:27 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @sirileknes Thank you, Siri! It means a lot coming from someone who is both a fantastic scientist and kind colleague 😁
1310309682830102528 2020-09-28 04:05:47 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> As the mother of two 8-month-old babies and an abnormally gassy 12-year-old dog, sometimes I feel like all I do is walk around the house saying, "Did you poop?!"  #momlife
1309745045722017792 2020-09-26 14:42:07 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @theyanespost @Heilig_Lab @RaeganMazurka @ConnorHaggarty Thank you!
1309562153922441217 2020-09-26 02:35:22 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @sarah_stern Currently dealing with this same problem. Had one paper in 2018 and one in 2019 that built on the previous, but both were "officially" published in 2020. Still trying to figure out the best way to ref them
1309561358392975365 2020-09-26 02:32:12 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @LinzyBay Omg talk to @JMurph22RC bc he LOVES condiments, including peper jelly.  We brought back 5 jars of pepper jelly from Marshall's last time we were home 😂 Aloha from Oregon is the brand
1309542743061024769 2020-09-26 01:18:14 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @Priotab @Heilig_Lab @RaeganMazurka @ConnorHaggarty FAAH is an enzyme that regulates the availability of the endocannabanoid anandamide. By inhibiting FAAH, we enhance endocannabinoid signaling, which we hope promotes fear extinction (in the context of iCBT) to further improve treatment
1309497087009214470 2020-09-25 22:16:49 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> It's official: our clinical trial is live! Together with @Heilig_Lab, we'll test the efficacy of FAAH inhibition + internet-delivered CBT in #PTSD. I'm super grateful to have postdocs @RaeganMazurka &amp; @ConnorHaggarty here to lead this exciting project!  https://t.co/lfvFmb73oT
1307736657471430659 2020-09-21 01:41:30 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @ConnorHaggarty Was trying to guess based off the decor but clearly haven't been out in a while 😂
1307735669419245570 2020-09-21 01:37:34 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @ConnorHaggarty Pitchers?
1306882559067000834 2020-09-18 17:07:37 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @Flagel_Lab @Huda_Akil1 You will need to get one for them on your next UP trip! I definitely have a few places I can recommend 😉
1306827751895203841 2020-09-18 13:29:50 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @Flagel_Lab @Huda_Akil1 I so enjoyed my time here; the science was great &amp; the staff was so kind. When Connie (in the kitchen) heard I was from the UP, she asked for a pasty recipe. I gave her my gram's &amp; then she'd email ahead of time to tell me when she'd be serving them for lunch (incl on my bday!)
1306638062764658689 2020-09-18 00:56:04 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @RebeccaBoehme You should post a picture of our current office views for comparison 😂
1306123714770108416 2020-09-16 14:52:14 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @RebeccaBoehme @JSuvilehto Congrats @JSuvilehto! Nice work!!
1305741164411342849 2020-09-15 13:32:07 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @zivacooper @AmirEnglund @iainsmcgregor @Lambert_Usyd Thanks, @zivacooper! I'd definitely have to add Christine Rabinak (@BrainsBeesBikes) to the list, as well
1304775543309697024 2020-09-12 21:35:05 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> Great job Dr. Perini (@NeuroIP)! 🎉  https://t.co/taRwnh9zZ1
1304703381626400769 2020-09-12 16:48:21 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> probably should mention that all times are in Central European Summer Time (CEST) 😬
1304680249712672768 2020-09-12 15:16:25 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> Then stick around @ECNPtweets to hear the fantastic @NeuroIP talk about rTMS, the insula, and AUD in the "Multilevel evidence for alcohol addiction as a brain network disorder" symposium at 2.20pm (her talk at 3.05pm)  https://t.co/nHmfJT2vph
1304679304190717954 2020-09-12 15:12:40 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> Congrats to @Heilig_Lab for receiving @ECNPtweets Neuropsychopharmacology Award!  See Markus' plenary lecture "Translational approaches to developing therapeutics for alcohol addiction: hopes, disappointments and new hopes" today (Sat.) at 1pm.  More info:  https://t.co/9IuT91JSED

1304383397079519232 2020-09-11 19:36:50 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> Me, finally accepting that I need to start prioritizing: "I cannot possibly accept another invitation to review a manuscript,"  -2 minutes later-  Every paper I've reviewed in the last 6+ months: "Please review this revision"  @AcademicChatter #AcademicTwitter
1302663356990582784 2020-09-07 01:42:01 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> It's month 7 and we're currently averaging 0.5 teeth/baby 😬  https://t.co/B8217qs3jh
1302111708551487497 2020-09-05 13:09:58 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @McreynoldsJayme Agreed. Somehow everything is rude so 'best' is our best bet 😬😂
1301966664939040768 2020-09-05 03:33:36 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @McreynoldsJayme I am a habitual "best" user and this whole discussion has thrown me for a loop. I just used "sincerely" to sign-off on an email and I already hate it. It just seems....not sincere? Either way, defaulting back to "best" immediately
1300874490352676868 2020-09-02 03:13:42 +0800 <MayoOnTheBrain> @ConnorHaggarty Yes, that was definitely in the fine print! 😉😂
