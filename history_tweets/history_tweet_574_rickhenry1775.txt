While voter fraud has been around as long as voting, now it's open in the public square, and we CANNOT and WILL NOT accept it as resulting in a stolen election. If we allow this to pass, America is finished: there will never be another election.

1329415610309120001 2020-11-19 21:25:55 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @locp86 Kinda grows your confidence in the whole election process from the start, doesn't it? You go vote; they may or may not put your vote someplace where it can actually be tabulated. And, if not, it may just turn up in a stack in a closet 2.5 weeks later. Or maybe not.

Support the immune system naturally, and you've got a much better chance of fighting off anything. The addition of non-natural toxins (vaccines, pharmaceuticals, etc.) exacerbate the problem; they don't help.

1328936983050203141 2020-11-18 13:44:01 +0800 <rickhenry1775> but how many even begin to know the truth of that history? Not very many. We are a nation under God, but organized religion is not friendly to the truth of that. How many see and understand that irony?   So much to learn, to resolve. Who will really engage? Will YOU?
1328936982404337666 2020-11-18 13:44:01 +0800 <rickhenry1775> Donald Trump is on our side. He is the first big target. But he is not the only target. If / when he prevails in this episode, what will happen in 4 years if the evil is not completely put away now? Do you think it will get better on its own? We have been blessed in our history -
1328936981565493248 2020-11-18 13:44:01 +0800 <rickhenry1775> and many other institutions not instantly suspect, including religious, financial, educational and "medical." We HAVE the solutions, but their effective use requires that we get smart, get engaged, and control our emotions. This is a fight to the death. Who will live?

1324363189996408837 2020-11-05 22:49:24 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @hobbsfam01 We've had an American Party, and we have the Constitution Party now (Howard Phillips started it as the Taxpayers Party.)
1324362643654758400 2020-11-05 22:47:14 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @hobbsfam01 PLEASE look at the massive amounts of evidence all around us that show that there is ZERO possibility that Biden won anything. Believe in President Trump enough to believe his words to that effect for months. You don't put PeeWee Herman up against Ali and say, "If PeeWee wins..."

Would you deposit cash in a bank drop box like this? Would you EXPECT there to be problems with it if you did?

This Amerika sneaks around hiding its fraud under a presumed cloak of legitimacy, propped up by the mainstream media, pretenders to the protections of our First Amendment.

1324359908750467073 2020-11-05 22:36:22 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @hobbsfam01 NO!!!! Biden cannot be "elected" by means of this massive election fraud. Getting all mushy about it will NOT help the truth to come out and prevail.
1324359354309611520 2020-11-05 22:34:10 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @KellyCan1968 Coffee, no: not too early.
1324359240950157313 2020-11-05 22:33:43 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @cactusncookies Hey, we've been under a national state of emergency since 1933, which only a President can remove. Not one has so far. Maybe now Trump can clean it up and stop it. It's way more massive than most people have the wavelength to begin to imagine, though.
1324358729177944076 2020-11-05 22:31:41 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @BlondieforTrump @FoxNews Hey, they haven't hidden it from us. They're the fox in the henhouse.
1324358590652510208 2020-11-05 22:31:08 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @FoxNews Good start. 1 down, 49 to go.

1324357243572260864 2020-11-05 22:25:46 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @GroundsMisty NO security. None. Nada. And you KNOW that a single instance of this happening on the part of Republicans, the DemonCraps would call the whole thing to a screeching halt.
1324356741589512193 2020-11-05 22:23:47 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @BlondieforTrump He is NOT viewed as a uniter by those who tout "unity," but for whom it is only a political platitude aimed at making them look "nicer" but who have nothing but hatred in their hearts for us who actually are guided by principles of truth. He unites based on TRUTH.
1324356300910768128 2020-11-05 22:22:02 +0800 <rickhenry1775> Some of us may owe Trump an apology. I know that I've called him out for allowing the fake "COVID" pandemic to even gain a foothold, for giving Fauci a platform, but if he KNEW that it was designed to create this election scenario which needed to happen for him to fix it ...
1324354326819688449 2020-11-05 22:14:11 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @TV_Promo_Dude Yeah, I think it might have something to do with that extra 2.5 cups of coffee I drink during that early morning time normally ...
1324353923889700869 2020-11-05 22:12:35 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @atensnut Only now, we're counting those DemonCraps and filming them as they trash and burn our ballots and as they manufacture fake ballots (without the official watermark) for Biden. That's a ton of EVIDENCE against them. They won't survive it.
1324353474746818560 2020-11-05 22:10:48 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @AbbaFather_13 Truth will out
1324352780975427587 2020-11-05 22:08:02 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @gina_durosko That's called ...  E.V.I.D.E.N.C.E.
1324351705350365184 2020-11-05 22:03:46 +0800 <rickhenry1775> Don't let it be said that the "major media" are not complicit in this whole demonic power grab attempt.
1324347897006247937 2020-11-05 21:48:38 +0800 <rickhenry1775> Not only did Trump win by a landslide, but his "opponent" will be removed from the ballot, disqualified, in total disgrace. DemonCraps will be on their knees, begging for mercy. (Well, maybe not quite that last part, but it's a nice thought, anyway.)
1324347051233169408 2020-11-05 21:45:16 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @BlondieforTrump He needs to take Newt's advice - file suit in all 50 states.
1324346680616099842 2020-11-05 21:43:48 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @Ek7_PRN Yep. People are awakening with confirmation that we are in the midst of a massive attack upon our nation by DemonCraps who want to destroy Trump and all of us good Americans in flyover country ... but that we're not going to allow it to happen. We will win. TRUMP 2024!
1324346190184460289 2020-11-05 21:41:51 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @YehudaVX And we all know that not a SINGLE INSTANCE of anything like this fraud happening at the hands of a Republican, or in favor of Trump, would be allowed without the whole system crashing immediately to a standstill.
1324345571684110337 2020-11-05 21:39:24 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @copdoc1 "Flu season" simply means that they have to slide some of their "COVID" cases back over into the "flu" column where they came from to begin with. (Notice how flu and pneumonia are both way down this year while "COVID" is up by the same numbers ... and total deaths are the same.)

1324341908265730050 2020-11-05 21:24:50 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @Frustr8ed @LABeachGal1 How many would be red on the map now if they had a single instance of a Republican blocking a Democrat from watching a poll ... or sneaking a suitcase into a counting station ... or burning a bag of Democrats ballots out behind a precinct?
1324341332450693120 2020-11-05 21:22:33 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @DebL66 @LABeachGal1 @reg1776 Now.  We will NOT recognize a "President Joe Biden." Not now; not ever.
1324341227530182656 2020-11-05 21:22:08 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @LABeachGal1 And we would be beyond naïve to expect anything else from them.
1324340730807144448 2020-11-05 21:20:09 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @kinsella_ray Why? Because the DemonCraps want the White House by whatever means they can steal it and they cannot come close to putting up a candidate who can give Donald Trump a fair challenge.
1324340381069225985 2020-11-05 21:18:46 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @copdoc1 That's all it ever was. That and a conspiracy to create a nationally-mandated mystery (control) vaccine.

1324195262437404677 2020-11-05 11:42:07 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @SunshineDreame6 And none of them have the digital watermark of official ballots, so all of them will provide evidence of election fraud. Heads will roll ...

1324127800572477440 2020-11-05 07:14:03 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @kinsella_ray @realDonaldTrump Read:   https://t.co/V2jNNHOPwF  We ARE all slaves on the federal plantation. Elsewise, this fraudulent "election" wouldn't be happening.
1324127192113172482 2020-11-05 07:11:38 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @ElizabethKlave3 No, it's just transitioned to its next phase, which is where it was all aimed to get to from the beginning - removing Trump from the White House and subjecting us to total tyranny.
1324126935056814085 2020-11-05 07:10:37 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @Matthew_4_Trump It allowed them to open the doors to "mail-in ballots," which are easily a voting fraud mechanism. There is no virus (at least not medical; only psychological), but it was used as the means to undermine this election. It's not over. Don't believe their lies. Biden does not win.
1324126396499791873 2020-11-05 07:08:28 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @UrUnpaidPundit Totally wrong. Lincoln WAS mob rule. He destroyed this nation. The Constitution of 1787 was completely replaced.
1324126201275965440 2020-11-05 07:07:42 +0800 <rickhenry1775> MUST SEE, FOLKS; MUST SEE! Rudy lays it on the line. THIS is what's happening, and it's all fraudulent. It's against the law. THIS is not representative of America, and it shall not stand.
1324123579299074050 2020-11-05 06:57:16 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @kinsella_ray @realDonaldTrump Uh, that's been tried before. Same enemy (Lincoln was NOT our friend), same tyrannical results.

1324120533152239617 2020-11-05 06:45:10 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @Matthew_4_Trump So true. It was bogus from day one, and designed to get us exactly here. Unfortunately, Trump didn't stand up to it from the beginning, and it may cost him the White House.
1324120121678438401 2020-11-05 06:43:32 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @Reuters Just who in the name of all that is good and right and true do you think YOU are, accusing the President of lying ("falsely claimed ...")? You think you are the arbiter of all that is true? Guess God can just go on vacation, then, as Reuters has it handled.

1324105496991686656 2020-11-05 05:45:25 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @gracelover19301 Exactly. Fraud one place by DemonCraps creates reasonable suspicion about fraud in other places where they're ruling over vote counts that are their pathway to the White House.
1324105153428049923 2020-11-05 05:44:03 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @MustangMan_TX Yeah, Wisconsin - more votes counted than actual registered voters ... which, of course, the MSM don't mention when they report that Trump is demanding a recount there.

Then Lincoln came after them with guns ...  Y'all need to learn the truth about Lincoln. He was no hero.

He seemed alive then. This cadaver today is a husk of what he once was ... and even then, he was mostly wind and dandy.

The church is not the ecclesia. (Jesus founded His ecclesia; man replaced it with church and "religion.") But the Bible itself is true - all 66 books of it.
1316938309751459841 2020-10-16 11:05:35 +0800 <rickhenry1775> @usmade1001Deb Completely correct. They assume that their foundations are true, but there are NOT. Same holds true, BTW, for church, for law, for medicine, for education, for most of American government (which is anything but Constitutional, as in based on the original 1787 COTUS).
