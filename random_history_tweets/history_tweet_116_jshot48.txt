It is solely about removing US troops so that Putin can replace them with Russian troops.  That is the play here.

When President-Elect Biden reverses the leases and returns the land to protected property the oil company execs can blame  the Trump administration.  No victims here.

1312344689534787589 2020-10-03 18:52:10 +0800 <jshot48> @CBSNews I can't wait until Dr. Jill Biden becomes First Lady.  She will restore dignity, honor, respect and compassion to that office and equally as important - there aren't any naked pictures of her spread eagle floating around the internet!
1312343400457351168 2020-10-03 18:47:03 +0800 <jshot48> @SethAbramson oops ... someone forgot to put a quarter in Pence's back so that he could download the latest speaking points to his Commodore 64 floppy lips.
1312343065840029702 2020-10-03 18:45:43 +0800 <jshot48> @BrianE_Fdn Thank you to all journalists.
1312342759181778944 2020-10-03 18:44:30 +0800 <jshot48> @CNN Why can't it be a live digital debate?  We don't want Biden or Kamala to be in the same space with any of those face mask defiant, irresponsible virus spreading republicans.  We have to protect Biden and Kamala.  Republicans view not wearing a mask as a badge so have at it.

Scientific experts tried mightily to get Trump to wear a mask consistently, social distance and stop the super spreader events, but Trump was defiant, irresponsible and absorbed in foolishness.
1312337189649383427 2020-10-03 18:22:22 +0800 <jshot48> @MSNBC @chrislhayes and ... like the common garden variety fool, his defiance eventually consumes him in consequences.  Only a fool would listen to another fool and accept foolishness as a badge of honor.  Trump demonstrated to the world that he is a twice baked double stuffed FOOL!

The only way that Trump could be transformed into being likable is Obama would have to coach him, so no chance in hell.  Trump is disliked and detested by the WORLD
1312327306778734592 2020-10-03 17:43:06 +0800 <jshot48> @weijia This again is just irresponsible. These are adult men &amp; women who are defiant, reckless and endangering. Please do not ask for empathy, well wishes or compassion when they are rushed to the hospital for COVID symptoms and that includes Trump. Breaking the rules have consequences.

1312117796273184768 2020-10-03 03:50:35 +0800 <jshot48> @JRubinBlogger Something is off and I mean way off.  Republicans tweeting that they talk to the President this morning and last night and he was in good spirits is the give away.  The only time you try to convince people that someone is fine is when they're not.

He blew it in the debate &amp; now in full recovery mode ✔He released video statements yesterday about contributions to the Catholic Church after feeling rejected by the Pope  ✔went on Fox to denounce white supremacy  ✔suddenly contracted COVID.
1312068608764391430 2020-10-03 00:35:08 +0800 <jshot48> @BBCWorld Don't get side tracked by this mild lie.  He blew in the debate and now in full recovery mode He released video statements yesterday about contributions to the Catholic Church after being rejected by the Pope, went on Fox to denounce white supremacy and suddenly contracted COVID.

1312067389392130051 2020-10-03 00:30:17 +0800 <jshot48> @NBCNews Hey Mitch, did you get a chance to ask him about 200,000+ dead and the people dying every day from COVID? or about his taxes or about his epic debate debacle or the militias trying to intimidate peaceful protesters and voters?  asking for a nation
1312043394936512515 2020-10-02 22:54:56 +0800 <jshot48> @CBSNews So is Bill Barr going to direct the DOJ to remove the militias from intimidating blocking protesters and voters?

1312031746930679808 2020-10-02 22:08:39 +0800 <jshot48> @BBCWorld I could be wrong, but I think I know where this is going now.  Trump's claim they contracted the Coronavirus, take a "vaccine" and the coronavirus recedes.  Vaccine promoted to the American people and Trump saves the day.  Instant hero and election polls rise.
1312031390884663296 2020-10-02 22:07:14 +0800 <jshot48> @NBCNews @PeterAlexander Where is Bill Barr and was he tested?

Ask yourself one question and one question only about the time we live in NOW.  Why did Russia and white supremacists groups pick the Republican party to infiltrate and takeover?  hint: they align with hate

My offer from yesterday still stands. You do understand that when you have years of lying about absolutely everything, news like this is hard to believe, right?
1311997807738396672 2020-10-02 19:53:47 +0800 <jshot48> @RepKatiePorter Go get em Congresswoman Porter.  You are the new standard.

1311852822510567427 2020-10-02 10:17:40 +0800 <jshot48> @matthewjdowd I do too.

1311848197225164803 2020-10-02 09:59:17 +0800 <jshot48> @NBCNews Trump, you have a 30+ days left and you continue to act like a dog chasing his tail.  Whatever you do will be undone, withdrawn, overridden, dismissed and laughed at once Biden is in office.  You would be best served by investing your time and energy in dealing with the virus!
1311847043405615106 2020-10-02 09:54:42 +0800 <jshot48> @thehill Trump, listen. I want you to really pay attention. Getting in front of a camera and reading a tele-prompter that lists monies given to various institutions does NOT fool the Pope.  NOTHING you said dismisses the reckless, racist &amp; hateful things you've done as president.  Get it?
1311844991069753347 2020-10-02 09:46:33 +0800 <jshot48> @HuffPost Hold out.

He refuses to taking accountability for acting like a stock raving idiot and now wants to blame everyone else because the world really saw him.  Biden doesn't need the debates so let him talk to himself!
1311841764769230849 2020-10-02 09:33:44 +0800 <jshot48> @MSNBC @JoyAnnReid Oh but there is more to consider - we recently learned that Trump is $421M in debt personally so it begs the question of have white supremacists groups given Trump money and now have leverage over him?  The national security risk concern could be domestic.

1311303272100245505 2020-09-30 21:53:57 +0800 <jshot48> @JasonKander @JoeBiden Today I awoke raging thinking about the debate.  Joe demonstrated his deep Christian values that resonated with America and the world.  It stuck me like a dagger as Biden kept saying my son, my son and Trump kept attacking with no regard, no compassion and no empathy.

The 200,000+ American deaths attributable to your failures and McConnell's blocking bills from the House did not rise to the occasion you say? I'm clear, thanks.
