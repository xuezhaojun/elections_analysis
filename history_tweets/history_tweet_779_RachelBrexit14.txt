1344055656551227398 2020-12-30 07:00:14 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @The_RealTruth18 @YardleyShooting Just noticed, you say their own immune system attacks their organs, isn't this what happens with HIV/aids and I believe the vaccines contain HIV proteins??
1344055175405854721 2020-12-30 06:58:19 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @The_RealTruth18 @YardleyShooting Yes and when this happens to lots of people they will call it a new super strain and lock us all up again 😡😡
1344054810832740353 2020-12-30 06:56:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Would love to know how many people went into hospital for all other non covid illnesses and due to a false positive test found themselves on a  so called covid ward where they caught flu on top of the illness they are being treated for????
1344054193032609792 2020-12-30 06:54:25 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @The_RealTruth18 @MrsSMHI Yes. I wonder how many people on 'covid wards' are actually just being treated for covid. Not many I expect.
1344052514078007297 2020-12-30 06:47:45 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @The_RealTruth18 @YardleyShooting Yes I have heard about this. Apparently this is why coronavirus vaccines never work, once the vaccinated cats got infected with coronavirus they would die of this condition. Immune response to flu is massive,  cannot be replicated in a vaccine,  the vaccine reduces it.

1344045653773725698 2020-12-30 06:20:29 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> When you are expected to lose your business,  your home , your cancer care and even your children's education for a virus that kills no more people than flu does, then you better ask questions when people tell you this suffering is your responsibility.
1344043699072880640 2020-12-30 06:12:43 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> It ends when people stop playing the game.
1344043417408516101 2020-12-30 06:11:36 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> How are they finding this? They tell us the only difference between old and new variant is 'possible ' transmission rate, so which test is showing this difference.  Not PCR, not lateral flow,  no difference in symptoms,  so how are they finding this from routine testing????

1340754432208809987 2020-12-21 04:22:21 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> At last, some actual journalism
1340754086216552457 2020-12-21 04:20:58 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Exactly,  why are they dressing this up as something they have no reason or proof to believe?
1340722368910680067 2020-12-21 02:14:56 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Clever how they did this to us! But , I feel a lot have now had enough.
1340720988577816577 2020-12-21 02:09:27 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @SeanAKehoe I think you are right. I also think Trump is just the sort of person to take that step.
1340720018145873921 2020-12-21 02:05:36 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Melinda91810186 Maybe. Or perhaps places to treat those who get very ill next winter after the vaccine destroys their immune systems against all other coronavirus?
1340644465543950336 2020-12-20 21:05:23 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So does anyone know what the real purpose of  nightingale hospitals is?
1340642491444457473 2020-12-20 20:57:32 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Definitely 👇🏼
1340642257750384643 2020-12-20 20:56:36 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @DPJHodges So you automatically believe that when a virus mutates it becomes more virulent,  this goes against all scientific teachings, viruses mutate and get weaker. If it hadn't mutated then that would signal real danger!
1340398351657938945 2020-12-20 04:47:25 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @bianchibully @MattHancock @Mpod1964 The bitter irony that they expect us to actually believe all this is saving the NHS....the economy pays for the NHS, no economy,  no NHS. That's the future.
1340397044951859204 2020-12-20 04:42:13 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Absolutely right David👇🏼
1340396565157056516 2020-12-20 04:40:19 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @MrTardigradeUK Hi Ian I hope you got proper treatment and have been stabilised.  Couldn't stop thinking about you after seeing this tweet!🙏🏻
1340396022011490304 2020-12-20 04:38:09 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 You too Colin,  it's nice to have you as a twitter friend. 🍷🍷
1340395591185121281 2020-12-20 04:36:26 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @jfdta @LadyTyke49 I agree he hasn't seized the narrative,  the media have gone lockdown socialist bonkers. This is the problem,  there are too many powerful institutions and individuals who have a vested interest in promoting fear
1340393999782309891 2020-12-20 04:30:07 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> This is exactly it I think 👇🏼. We are being played.

1340227654994280449 2020-12-19 17:29:07 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> They have nothing but contempt for the average person to think we can be fooled by such obvious showmanship.
1340064119198797826 2020-12-19 06:39:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So medical staff tested get positive result retested to eliminate false positives.  Patients don't,  even if they are asymptomatic they are labelled with covid and all that entails.  They absolutely know what they are doing to us don't they!
1340059248131272706 2020-12-19 06:19:56 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Hospitals can't cope they say👇🏼👇🏼

1339998480006262788 2020-12-19 02:18:28 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Strikes me as too much of a coincidence that this report should come out right now after Andy Burnham stood up to the government.

1339874807022809088 2020-12-18 18:07:02 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 Strange goings on indeed. I see the old retweet facility is back, now the election is over no doubt!
1339871982695944192 2020-12-18 17:55:48 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> What on earth is actually going on, this virus is as deadly as flu yet the west grinds to a halt?

1339662368826150914 2020-12-18 04:02:53 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 Hi Colin glad u had a nice walk, good for the mind a nice walk. Have you noticed on twitter that you can't read all your replies, or is it just me?? Says 20 on the bell icon, can only see two to read!!
1339560068187078657 2020-12-17 21:16:22 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 👍🏻🍷hope you are doing well Colin 😊

1339326562324393985 2020-12-17 05:48:30 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 Yes, lots hate her don't they, but to be honest I like to listen to her just to feel normal again,  that people like her are free to criticise the narrative.

I fear what is happening is a sort of modern warfare,  not a single bullet fired and yet we are forced by fear to accept a new way of life.

1339250375900192769 2020-12-17 00:45:46 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> I would just add, it is a corrupt parliament,  not just government,  there is literally no opposition to this tyranny!

1339243577264713730 2020-12-17 00:18:45 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JeremyVineOn5 Absolutely not!!! We live in a free country  so let's fight to keep it free.

1339241204811243520 2020-12-17 00:09:19 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Who are these people,  the majority we are told, that believe restrictions should be tighter?? I am yet to talk to anyone that isn't becoming disturbed by current restrictions and tiers etc
1338974756809416705 2020-12-16 06:30:33 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @ghost_wales Men are being deliberately deconstructed into a sort of cross sex expectation and portrayal. It really is sickening,  I tell my son all the time to be proud of who he is and his sex.
1338973305005551623 2020-12-16 06:24:47 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @thetruebluechef @EssexPR I think it's to enforce the lie. 😡

1338969606531264519 2020-12-16 06:10:05 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> It stinks doesn't it, policy is like the okey cokey these days .
1338914795639234562 2020-12-16 02:32:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 If it's planned, as it seems to be then it does fit nicely with the WEF plans to destroy democracy.  I expect they will cancel the May elections because there is too big an opportunity there for a democratic fight back. This all stinks of communist China.
1338912454311555074 2020-12-16 02:22:59 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 It makes no sense in a democratic capitalist country to destroy middle England because of a flu virus! It's making me really mad now because a lot of this is so deep it's irreversible,  but maybe that's the plan.
1338909565904187392 2020-12-16 02:11:30 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 That's right Colin,  it's almost like they planned it that way.

1338887680986329088 2020-12-16 00:44:33 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> There is no democracy in Parliament when it comes to the Reset, they are mostly all on board.

To think a cotton mask is going to stop a virus,  much more tiny than the mask fibres, is bonkers.  Also sucking in your own bacteria causes bacterial infection
1337484909489893378 2020-12-12 03:50:26 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @jengleruk It contains a viral gene, this has never been done before, a lot of scientists saying this has not been adequately trialled for this reason alone.

1336753043568783360 2020-12-10 03:22:15 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> How to make a casedemic,  test the fit and well and pronounce them sick via PCR.
1336591412155068419 2020-12-09 16:39:59 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> It's always been there, it used to be elite universities churning them out, now they all are so the problem is much bigger.
1336590989620895746 2020-12-09 16:38:19 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> We have to get back to face to face appointments.  How many deaths could have been avoided if GPs were doing normal in person consultations?

No , is something huge about to happen,  cyber attack or another health 'incident '?

1336391735782596612 2020-12-09 03:26:33 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Completely correct.  The test is inadequate and can't tell between a current or past infection.  Testing in high infection areas produces lots of false positives from previous infections.

1335880097652412417 2020-12-07 17:33:29 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Ant_Ware @alexlondon Asymptomatic is totally untrue according to the majority of scientists I have listened talk on this subject,  and the pre symptomatic window is so small as to be not worthy of any intervention.
1335878151315083266 2020-12-07 17:25:45 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> This is the whole argument that masks shut people down. 👇🏼

1335873571927838720 2020-12-07 17:07:33 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @emmakennytv This is absolutely sickening.  Just goes to show , you give some people an inch, in terms of control, and they take a mile and then another mile.
1335872922121015298 2020-12-07 17:04:58 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Steve05470007 Yes I do. Once a week to watch some educational drama. It had big doors in front of the screen 😆
1335864305556877315 2020-12-07 16:30:44 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon You are keen on the words  deniers and anti vax aren't you. You see everything black and white when life is mostly grey. Goodbye.
1335864102233763840 2020-12-07 16:29:55 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon So you haven't had covid on last 6 months, hence the negative tests. So what does that prove about it being useful??
1335863889767133185 2020-12-07 16:29:05 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon It's perfectly true when your test is a piece of rubbish that doesn't differentiate between current and past infection!! Its laughable as a test, absolutely criminal.
1335863584274919426 2020-12-07 16:27:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon No we will never agree. You insist on slurring me with the anti vax tag when I am absolutely not anti vax. You believe anyone in the street can kill people and doesn't have the right to walk about. I listen to many thousands of Doctors and scientists,  Barrington, you govnt only.
1335862814444048385 2020-12-07 16:24:48 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon I don't take orders with medical issues, I do my research and use my common sense that I need it. Obviously,  I mean who takes experimental medical interventions they don't need you would have to be crazy.
1335862445420720129 2020-12-07 16:23:20 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Ant_Ware @alexlondon It is not an allergic reaction to have symptoms,  it is because you are not immune.  If you have no symptoms you are immune.  If you are immune you can't spread anything,  how else do you think vaccines work.
1335721409461547009 2020-12-07 07:02:55 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon Not true. This is now a casedemic.  The PCR test used in this way is criminal and I for one look forward to the upcoming court cases.
1335720681313607683 2020-12-07 07:00:01 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon Covid will never go away unless we stop using the totally rubbish PCR test and telling healthy people they are sick and people dying of cancer or strokes they are now covid deaths.
1335720301108269064 2020-12-07 06:58:30 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon My source is the WHO and many scientists I have listened to talking on the subject.  I put those opinions above Twitter people.
1335719676345724929 2020-12-07 06:56:01 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon New trials after concluding trials as set out are tweaks on the original phase aim. Oxford vaccine currently going through a new trial at phase 3 because they had to ask another question to get specific absent data
1335719143954292737 2020-12-07 06:53:55 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon Absolutely rubbish!!!! Asymptomatic throughout is immune! Asymptomatic as a phase before developing symptoms is a tiny window of just hours.
1335718544865169408 2020-12-07 06:51:32 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon Which Doctors is that then, thousands are saying we don't need a vaccine. Many scientists saying in these circumstances it's positively dangerous.  Can we at least agree that there is no exact science,  this vaccine is a grey area.
1335718121550778368 2020-12-07 06:49:51 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon That is absolutely untrue, some people only get sick for  day or two and then it's gone! Some people don't get sick atall as they are immune already.
1335717703500357635 2020-12-07 06:48:11 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon If they are going to develop symptoms,  the window between infection and symptomatic transmission is tiny. The way you are talking we should all be walking round in hazmat suits as a matter of normality.  Bonkers.
1335717098333630464 2020-12-07 06:45:47 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon You think that people with no symptoms atall are infecting people. That's bonkers. If the pathogens are met with immunity they cannot multiply and can't make someone ill and can't be spread.
1335716205232058370 2020-12-07 06:42:14 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon Not true, it is impossible to be infectious when you are symptomless.  Many scientists saying this and even WHO.
1335715542712332292 2020-12-07 06:39:36 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon Do you not realise that vaccines are normally trialled for 7-10 years...they normally get tweaked and retrialled as a matter of course.
1335715172829323269 2020-12-07 06:38:08 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon You can't have a virus present,  display no symptoms,  unless you are immune!!!
1335712672860528644 2020-12-07 06:28:12 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> I have had every childhood vaccine offered and have no regrets about it, I am not anti vax, but I will not have this vaccine.
1335711988270379012 2020-12-07 06:25:28 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon Something we can agree on, immune people,  commonly called asymptomatic,  don't spread.
1335711393866276872 2020-12-07 06:23:07 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon So on what grounds do you think fit and well people spread the virus, if as you rightly say, if immune system response is quick there are no pathogens  .
1335710911043162114 2020-12-07 06:21:12 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon Pheizer can't say much about this vaccine as known fact as it hasn't been trialled long enough or diverse enough. I am happy to take properly trialled and tested vaccines,  over several years, for illnesses that could kill me. This covid vaccine doesn't qualify  in either.
1335710113806635017 2020-12-07 06:18:02 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG You can't vaccinate the world,  healthy people do not need a vaccine for flu. Flu has existed forever.  Our bodies have inherited response, T Cell response and antibody response, within a healthy person all of that works better than a flu jab. NOT anti vax so don't go there.
1335709170729963521 2020-12-07 06:14:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon I am risking no ones life by being healthy,  healthy people don't make anyone sick. If I got sick I would stay at home. This vaccine right now does not stop transmission,  that is a fact much talked about on various radio channels I have listened to. Pheizer say it.
1335706186927190020 2020-12-07 06:02:25 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon I am sorry you struggle with your health, but your position is not made better by healthy people getting vaccines that lower what would have been their natural immune response while also not stopping transmission.
1335705796735340545 2020-12-07 06:00:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG Sorry but you are sounding increasingly disturbed now. You actually think people with healthy immune systems should get vaccines that provide them with a less good immune response and doesn't even stop transmission??? And that makes for a safer environment???

1335703713026101248 2020-12-07 05:52:36 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Surely that's a comprehensive victory for those aiming to prove fraud!

1335366917964632065 2020-12-06 07:34:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @ChrisMasonViews @SkyNews When was this speech,  it's pretty devastating
1335364453077045253 2020-12-06 07:24:30 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> It's disgusting what is happening to churches. Where is the anger from the church itself...
1335360819224326147 2020-12-06 07:10:03 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> What happens next in America is huge for all of us . I have no doubt the EU are desperate for Biden to actually get through the door but know that he may not

1335359048863059970 2020-12-06 07:03:01 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @juckky72 Definitely France, they are serious protesters over there.

1335355573416681479 2020-12-06 06:49:13 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO I don't like sneering,  self righteous,  judgemental types that think all their considerations are superior to anyone else that disagrees with them. They usually end many of their communications with a 🤣
1335279098185330688 2020-12-06 01:45:19 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO That's totally the wrong sum to do
1335278985572397057 2020-12-06 01:44:53 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Do you know what I really dislike , people that give you very simple sums to do that they actually believe are beyond you because they think anyone with the temerity to disagree must be thick
1335278456733577218 2020-12-06 01:42:47 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Yes the laptops are interesting,  just shows how deep the corruption in US goes that there has been a media blackout on anything anti Biden, same as UK. The media are nothing more than leftie puppets of communist extremists.
1335277973662994433 2020-12-06 01:40:51 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO The economy was far from booming but he made it so , he improved employment for minorities,  vastly reduced cost of medicines for the not so well off. It was ranked by covid, like everyone elses, made worse by the Democrat backed BLM burning the place down

1335182429242486786 2020-12-05 19:21:12 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> It does add up actually if you take total tested,  find 1% of that number and then deduct what you get from the positive number. You don't need to believe it, it's scientific fact
1335182010713829377 2020-12-05 19:19:32 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> He also  1, Doesn't want wars 2, Doesn't take bribes from China 3, wants the US economy to boom for all 4, Doesn't commit massive fraud and corruption to win elections

1335152437527777280 2020-12-05 17:22:01 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Amazing
1335151136089780225 2020-12-05 17:16:51 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> This is why the left can never be trusted with the economy.  Keynesian economics is a disaster.

1334929549864427520 2020-12-05 02:36:21 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Is Spain proof of what Fauci said in 2016, that mass mask wearing causes more illnesses than it prevents.
1334928673602985993 2020-12-05 02:32:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Their eagerness to get this stuff in my blood is really quite alarming
1334927838382862341 2020-12-05 02:29:33 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So how come their Lawyers aren't stopping deportations?
1334927646354976773 2020-12-05 02:28:47 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Typical, another Labour politician caught committing fraud 👇🏼

1334924897504604161 2020-12-05 02:17:51 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 Never done FB. Only came on twitter a year ago! I think a lot of it is that we have been too long under the rule of EU and getting rid of that, for some, is like getting rid of a parent..
1334924222330785793 2020-12-05 02:15:10 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Fabu_Bean We will have to get a vaccine for it!!😁
1334923645307793409 2020-12-05 02:12:53 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> If your immune system will give you 99.6% cover from death why would you swap that for an artificial immune response which is significantly lower? You can only have one response to this virus,  your system or the artificial system.
1334923187323367424 2020-12-05 02:11:04 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Good question! 👇🏼Also what are the bodily consequences of having just had the flu jab before the covid jab?
1334904872240558082 2020-12-05 00:58:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 Why are the nasty people the ones that call themselves liberals and European??😩
1334904540223713281 2020-12-05 00:56:58 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Out of a population of 67 million I would say those figures are now pitiful
1334904066858749954 2020-12-05 00:55:05 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Who are these crazy people that STILL think the EU beaurocrats are decent people???
1334903799509643266 2020-12-05 00:54:01 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> I trust myself!
1334903303126257664 2020-12-05 00:52:03 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> And what about those that are now terminally ill due to covid NHS?
1334903071701413898 2020-12-05 00:51:08 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Absolutely wrong and frightened.  The people doing this in the name of a virus don't care about your life, remember that.
1334902704896962567 2020-12-05 00:49:40 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @ghost_wales Which of all the many new sexes does that then???
1334902417889095684 2020-12-05 00:48:32 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 Yes I am good thanks.  Can't believe how nasty some people are getting now a vaccine is coming out, some really believe people should be forced. Just shows, every generation needs to fight for freedom!

1334895496675078148 2020-12-05 00:21:02 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 No worries Colin , glad to hear you are upsetting Twitter!!!
1334894675824693248 2020-12-05 00:17:46 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG I have been entirely consistent  that mostly old and ill are dying, you made the first statement I made the second,  so why are you deliberately twisting our conversation?
1334894350317334536 2020-12-05 00:16:28 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Oh what a tangled web we weave 👇🏼he made the first statement,  I made the second.
1334893957785022468 2020-12-05 00:14:55 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG For sure there are rule breakers, you will never get 100% compliance.  But most people are behaving safely. But not forever,  once the old or vulnerable get their vaccine there are no more excuses for killing business and mass unemployment.
1334893330036105218 2020-12-05 00:12:25 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> The US is being brought down by the Democrat movement,  they are more concerned with deals with China than their own people. The WEF globalists can't get going without Biden. God help us all when Biden is in charge.
1334892803512557570 2020-12-05 00:10:20 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG All of my analysis are from hours and hours of scientists interviewed on covid via YouTube as most are deplatformed from most media because their concerns and explanations don't tally often with the narrative. How on earth do I cut and paste that many  links .
1334839949217181703 2020-12-04 20:40:18 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @MetaFrequencies @ElzMo3008 Because it contains a viral gene.
1334839014222950402 2020-12-04 20:36:35 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> What's the point in a vaccine that doesn't stop people catching the virus or spreading it, as for stopping them die well 99.6%  wouldn't have died anyway😡
1334778267589627904 2020-12-04 16:35:12 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Too many powerful people are enjoying this recent breakdown in personal freedoms 😡 they are happy to break us down.
1334777867301957632 2020-12-04 16:33:37 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @P4triQt Best, Cornish, worst London .
1334777153456656385 2020-12-04 16:30:47 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO Look when you bring Trump into the argument you are going political.  This is what I absolutely hate, the politicization of a medical situation. When politics are mixed with medical decisions I get mad. I don't trust ANY political involvement in medicine,  then I trust neither.
1334776132957331456 2020-12-04 16:26:43 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG Sorry I don't agree. The vast majority dying are elderly and ill.  Yes there are some tragic younger deaths but unfortunately you get that with flu. To blame people for causing these deaths is not fair, I never see anyone failing to follow guidance and many millions unemployed
1334631615121813504 2020-12-04 06:52:27 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG Exactly we accept what is within the limits of our knowledge.  I can't get too upset about very old people dying of flu when kids die of cancer. A life lived is a blessing.  I fully accept my mortality and if I am lucky to get old then I will accept my end as many don't grow old.
1334630659487395842 2020-12-04 06:48:40 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Stop calling us anti vaxers as a way of delegitimising honest thoughtful questions!!! Pro informed consent 👇🏼👇🏼

We have always lived with the reality that life gets riskier as we get older or face illness. It comes to us all, so what has moved the goal posts, why is it not acceptable to die if you are old and very ill ?

1334563978475950082 2020-12-04 02:23:42 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Depopulation through vaccines, now where have I heard that before?????
1334563792747958273 2020-12-04 02:22:57 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> I would say that means it does, as claimed to be a possibility by Yeadon.
1334563556445085696 2020-12-04 02:22:01 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CromwellStuff @MattHancock Probably because it risks miscarriage due to diminishing a chemical needed for placenta formation (Yeadon).
1334563071369629699 2020-12-04 02:20:05 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Could this all be deliberate,  a bit of UK verses EU as a sort of vaccine PR gambit for brexiteers???

1334557938271318016 2020-12-04 01:59:42 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> It shouldn't be given to women of reproductive age then surely?? It's all to do with the  chemical needed to create a placenta in pregnancy.

1334557206679859200 2020-12-04 01:56:47 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Yeadon states that previously coronavirus vaccines had a side effect of attacking the chemical in women needed to create a placenta in pregnancy.

That doesn't mean I should be forced to live in fear or alter my immune system with a genetic vaccine. When people get sick we care for them  best we can.  But all life leads to death.
1334554227503460355 2020-12-04 01:44:57 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @alexlondon @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG As you well know this vaccine is incredibly different to all other vaccines which were trialled over several years, some many more. Also coronavirus vaccines are particularly problematic due to the massive immune response which is necessary.  First ever vaccine with gene virus...

Different states have different testing regimens and higher or lower test revolutions.

1334537453785452544 2020-12-04 00:38:18 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG Why would you want anyone coerced into a medical procedure they neither want or need??? That's a bit sick really. I just want everyone to make up their own minds depending on their own views or situation.  I don't believe fascism has a place in medicine.
1334536970555576322 2020-12-04 00:36:22 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> I stand corrected. It certainly makes you wonder what the hell is really going on.
1334536704871587842 2020-12-04 00:35:19 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 Quite right Colin. There are billions exchanging hands and powers/freedoms handed over by the people for what exactly?
1334536308342075393 2020-12-04 00:33:45 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Our government cannot be totally stupid so I agree they have been complicit in generating an over reach of fear.

1334416510207598593 2020-12-03 16:37:42 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO It's all about money and power, big pharmaceutical companies are running the west, their power over millions of lives is massive. Most top rate scientists get bought, for millions,  by big pharma. Some scientists that worked for him claim he covered up cancer cures.
1334415640585773057 2020-12-03 16:34:15 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG That's one of the huge problems with PCR they pick up old RNA from previous dead infections and create positives.  They can't tell the difference between active virus and dead viral dna.
1334415329812951040 2020-12-03 16:33:01 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG There are at least 1% false positives,  if you take total number tested and take 1% of that number and subtract it from the rate of positives ( that's the science) you eradicate around 90% of current cases.
1334414866518519812 2020-12-03 16:31:11 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG Sorry but I closely follow WHO and they have said it is no more deadly than flu. They have said stop lockdowns also.  Why aren't we listening anymore??
1334414390637060096 2020-12-03 16:29:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG The test is absolutely unfit for purpose,  shutting down business on the back of such a bad test is immoral. There are many studies and court cases now saying this.

1334278460898992132 2020-12-03 07:29:09 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG New transmission rates, in fact all transmission rates are bogus for covid as they depend on a PCR test which is incapable of telling the difference between past and current infections. Positive cases like wise are highly suspect for that reason.
1334277536801546240 2020-12-03 07:25:29 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Fauci is a liar that is why he now promotes masks. You can find his study on Spanish flu on youtube. They were homemade masks, sound familiar .

It's really that simple. If I,unvaccinated,  transmit covid then people with a vaccine are protected from me. Only over 60s get flu jab, it works despite vast majority not
1334275826918060032 2020-12-03 07:18:41 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @alexlondon @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG Flu has always potentially killed the elderly or sick and occasionally the young and fit. Always has always will. Flu has always had occasional life changing effects on some people's lives. Why aren't we accepting of that anymore?
1334274912379342854 2020-12-03 07:15:03 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Welcome to the new normal, even sworn in President gets ignored if he isn't saying the 'right' thing!
1334274511399751680 2020-12-03 07:13:27 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> I don't know a single person who has  decided not to take the vaccine that is also an antivaxer.

1334236888916484102 2020-12-03 04:43:57 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG I agree with him. The numbers are normal for the time of year for a flu virus.
1334236388452130820 2020-12-03 04:41:58 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG As you can see from your graph, what you call a second wave the following year was actually explained by Fauci as a wave of deaths not of Spanish flu but rather lung diseases and pleurisy brought on by regular mask wearing. Fauci did a study in 2016.
1334235739714969601 2020-12-03 04:39:23 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @alexlondon @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG If I believed this vaccine would remain free of coercion then I would agree with you.
1334235268820381698 2020-12-03 04:37:31 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG They can discredit and delegitimise him in a heartbeat if he is so wrong, but they don't . If I was a SAGE scientist and this ex colleague was saying what I knew to be very wrong I wouldn't hesitate to bring his theories down. Despite his challenges they never do.
1334234107690315778 2020-12-03 04:32:54 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG No such thing as a second wave with a virus,  that is a scientific fact. You get secondary ripples in isolated regions but that's it. Vallance was taught that as are all scientists. As for criticising graphs, I haven't seen a single govnt scientist graph that came true.
1334233522261946370 2020-12-03 04:30:35 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @alexlondon @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG Quite right too, but again why should most people who will 99.6% recover well be vaccinated? Life is about balance of risk, if your risk is high you mitigate it, if it isn't you just get on with due caution. What's changed.
1334232630313840641 2020-12-03 04:27:02 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @alexlondon @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG I am sorry for what has happened to you personally,  flu is a terrible illness that can kill the very old and occasionally make previously fit and well very ill too. But that is a risk we have all taken all our lives, why are we not allowed to balance that risk anymore?
1334231917978378240 2020-12-03 04:24:12 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CofPO @cherbic555 @AlokSharma_RDG He can't be faulted when it comes to his medical knowledge,  and he isn't alone, many other renowned scientists saying the same things. Why doesn't the government directly challenge him if he's talking rubbish,  he pleads with them to do so in the public interest.

Covid19 will not be killing most people under 60 and certainly not kids, so why the vaccine for those people.  Either your vaccine works or it doesn't.
1334224405841530881 2020-12-03 03:54:21 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CarolHambelton Vaccines are only for diseases that kill. This virus doesn't kill kids.

Unfortunately every attempt has always produced potentially deadly consequences . It is very different to ANY other vaccine in what it needs to do. Many scientists say nothing has changed.....

Yeadon tweet says that coronavirus vaccines contain chemicals that could affect a woman's ability to develop a placenta in pregnancy.  Also when faced with the real virus the vaccine can put system into overdrive and start killing healthy cells. Not good.
1334143081378160640 2020-12-02 22:31:12 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @BrexitBassist They could put Michael Yeadon head to head with Vallance live on TV but of course they won't because they know how badly it would go for the vaccine they so desperately want us to have.

1333830562398826497 2020-12-02 01:49:22 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @errjustsaying The plan is everything back functioning as normal, freedom of choices in if or how you protect yourself and protect the elderly and vulnerable,  but only with their consent. Most businesses are now covid friendly.  Most people use good sense.

What are the effects on our immune systems to taking both these vaccines let alone just the covid one??

1332594202941779971 2020-11-28 15:56:31 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> There is no way out of this self created chaos, that is what they want you to feel, so you submit to their solutions
1332593828243644416 2020-11-28 15:55:01 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> There is an effort to cause confusion,  unemployment,  disunity,  anxiety,  depression and hopelessness.  Chaos. Then out of their chaos they bring the solution,  the final solution.  It's downright evil.
1332592728459325447 2020-11-28 15:50:39 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Indeed,  nobody is talking about how this virus was released either

1332349869386838025 2020-11-27 23:45:37 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Carol has a great idea, pubs should do deals with local takeaways for food to be ordered and delivered to pubs . Small businesses helping each other. Fantastic idea Carol ( she can't be retweeted)
1332347642106568708 2020-11-27 23:36:46 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> All the conspiracies became facts, that's when you know nothing was or is how it ever seemed to be

Yet they say it won't affect the vaccine being ready in April as previously said . Makes me shudder the sloppiness going on.

1332066084388802560 2020-11-27 04:57:57 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Classic, my Mother In Law gets all her news from BBC and Sky and thinks the stuff I tell her from Talk radio etc is bonkers and fake news. The elderly,  most vulnerable tend to listen to BBC and no doubt will queue up for their vaccine in full faith when it comes.
1332065145120567296 2020-11-27 04:54:13 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Fabu_Bean There are a lot of conflicting reports on this I think. Perhaps the Oxford vaccine will pass for the under 55s only. Oxford apparently saying they will quickly trial the new dosage on the 55s up and it shouldn't affect the drug being ready by April as they had said originally.
1332064223476781068 2020-11-27 04:50:34 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @thetruebluechef It's almost like they are deliberately ruining certain industries,  getting them to spend what little money they can get together to be covid safe and then shutting them anyway. It's cruel, unnecessary and downright criminal.

1332058428693475328 2020-11-27 04:27:32 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Fabu_Bean Talkradio reports Oxford  don't have the data to say whether the vaccine is either safe or effective for the over 55s due to the way they issued dosages during the trials. Apparently it will likely get retrialled for phase 3 to get the data needed.
1332035390279196673 2020-11-27 02:55:59 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> What is this I hear about Oxford Vaccine not being properly trialled regarding dosage?? Anyone heard???

1331294853636952065 2020-11-25 01:53:22 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Joanna13071726 But surely if you are vaccinated it doesn't matter that others aren't,  you are protected by your vaccine .
1331294562237755393 2020-11-25 01:52:12 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @MarkAlanMarks1 @Joanna13071726 I will not be taking a vaccine that has been trialled for less than one year for a virus I have 99.7% chance of surviving.  It boggles my mind that people say they will, DNA changing vaccine at that!
1331293943884099586 2020-11-25 01:49:45 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @GrandmasterMan Yes, I used to work at a Nissan garage registering motability cars, that was most of the new car sales!

1330937345684762625 2020-11-24 02:12:45 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Very worrying
1330935774888517632 2020-11-24 02:06:30 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Quite right. Once the elderly and vulnerable are vaccinated  , if they wish it, then surely everything should open up, no excuses!

1330934341388603395 2020-11-24 02:00:49 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @RyanRallyOh I wonder if the vaccines are being announced in a deliberate order, depending which section of society they want to aim it at. Pheizer for elderly in homes etc, Modura for over 60s, oxford vaccine for everyone else??

I am from the UK but a lot of us here see Trump as the last defense against a global communist takeover.  Our legal system is totally corrupt along with everything else. MSM here are nasty towards Trump but it doesn't reflect the majority here. Good luck 👍🏻
1330625435441487876 2020-11-23 05:33:20 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 Yes Colin, only time will tell. Ultimately we are powerless,  just watching how these things develop.

The elderly 1st with -70 ° vaccine,  live virus? Next 50-65yrs only -20 , possibly no live virus.  Then another more suited to under 50s to appear after that etc....

1328989543874383875 2020-11-18 17:12:53 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Nic46412431 The 1936 Olympics in Berlin were a pure propaganda show of nazism with the nazi salute , by then well associated with the nazi regime. By attending the games teams were giving political validity to nazism.

1328785725005901824 2020-11-18 03:42:59 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> I agree that this does seem a bit crazy, why would a brexiteer want the free world to fall to communism?
1328785097148018689 2020-11-18 03:40:29 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Devolvement in Scotland just weaponised the SNP in their hatred of the English, of course Blair knew that would be the case.
1328782943486152714 2020-11-18 03:31:55 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Well well, this is interesting
1328754363171540993 2020-11-18 01:38:21 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Hang on isn't there only 67 million people?
1328753922685726723 2020-11-18 01:36:36 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Now here's an idea,  won't fly though because there is no fear, they need us scared as hell.
1328753236644392960 2020-11-18 01:33:53 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Nic46412431 The Nazis adopted this salute in 1933 when Hitler became Chancellor,  from 1933 it was a salute to nazism
1328629265252888580 2020-11-17 17:21:16 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> And to think we were once a free country
1328627379204448257 2020-11-17 17:13:46 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Why are the abusive, violent far left obsessed with 'finding ' far right individuals to point the finger at.....think I answered my own question there.

1328622844524302338 2020-11-17 16:55:45 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So true!👇🏼
1328471503395053568 2020-11-17 06:54:22 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> It's rather like when the Olympics went ahead despite the war ahead, the English players asked to do the Nazi salute before the match
1328467618215448577 2020-11-17 06:38:56 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Perhaps they are worried because they know he would certainly test positive due to broken dna particles still hanging around . This would blow apart the validity of the tests and the casedemic
1328466438689083393 2020-11-17 06:34:15 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> The UK was once a bastion of freedom and democracy,  who would have thought it would fall so quickly into communism from just a flu virus?

You are silenced, isolated and drip fed bad information! Let's leave this now

1328296732573261824 2020-11-16 19:19:54 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Racism exists amongst all races, privilege and corruption exists amongst all races. Racism towards whites needs to be addressed just like all forms of racism need to be addressed.
1328295825898954754 2020-11-16 19:16:18 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @emmakennytv Why the obsession with privilege amongst white men, there is much corruption around the world involving rich privileged none whites!!!
1328293795671269376 2020-11-16 19:08:14 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> What the hell are the police doing in this country,  they are literally terrorising people for walking down a street!
1328292569390911488 2020-11-16 19:03:21 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> I get the feeling Boris wants to hide away for 2 weeks for some reason, possibly to so with the US election???

1328275420819693568 2020-11-16 17:55:13 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> An experimental vaccine for our children to protect the over 80s, to who exactly does that make ethical /scientific sense.

1328273434846097408 2020-11-16 17:47:19 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Catching something twice and then being significantly ill second time rnd makes no scientific sense regarding a virus. Rather like the claim that asymptomatic positives make others ill,  and are not simply immune.

1328099677150081025 2020-11-16 06:16:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> I want my freedom back, they are using a flu virus to lock us all up and dangle the key before us but always just out of reach.  This was all planned wasn't it.
1328097620028497920 2020-11-16 06:08:42 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> I think a lot of Tory voters are feeling rightly annoyed that they voted Tory and got Caroline Lucas!

1328090207183384576 2020-11-16 05:39:14 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamessReality @JOHjohJOH12 Because they want to "prove" you can get it twice....which of course you can't when T Cells memory lasts decades. But no doubt he will become unwell to ramp up the fear and get people to take the vaccine that we don't need. Don't trust anything anymore.
1328089611906723840 2020-11-16 05:36:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @F_Fuxake @JOHjohJOH12 So sorry to hear this. My son is 16 and has started having really bad dreams where he is out of control,  he has never had these sorts of worries.  We are damaging our children needlessly.  So angry now.
1328034260956160000 2020-11-16 01:56:56 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> The press don't seem to have independent thought anymore

1327915062439403520 2020-11-15 18:03:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Will you change your mind atall when , as in Denmark,  the vaccine that most people don't need becomes compulsory?
1327912064384372736 2020-11-15 17:51:22 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> The fascists are calling anyone who doubts the safety of a rushed vaccine anti vaxers! They want to shut down these people's voices
1327906932288606208 2020-11-15 17:30:58 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Everywhere in media there is a push to dismiss those that don't want a rushed vaccine as anti vax nutters, and a need to purge their voice from all media,  isn't that called fascism!

1327548078417735680 2020-11-14 17:45:01 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> We voted Tory, we got leftie green party, the Tories are simply not Tory anymore.
1327391491354976265 2020-11-14 07:22:47 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> This is a good point👇🏼
1327390103585566721 2020-11-14 07:17:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> If this is true, expect the reset policies that would eventually destroy most of us.

1327249659962814466 2020-11-13 21:59:12 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 I agree.  There is no way this vaccine will improve people's health, with an already 99.6% survival rate. It may however have devastating and irreversible effects on immune response. I don't trust any of them , they are all proven liars.

1327246888123428866 2020-11-13 21:48:11 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @WhiteEagle1900 The amount of fraud I am  reading about is huge , like you might expect in North Africa!!!

1327016118335250435 2020-11-13 06:31:12 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Spooksy2 @MichaelYeadon3 I don't care what your choice of expert is,  frankly all any if us should be concerned about right now is the freedom to listen to all who speak and the freedom to choose what we believe and don't. If all we get is a small group of political voices then we are not free atall
1327015027933667330 2020-11-13 06:26:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 Very worrying
1327010119251603456 2020-11-13 06:07:21 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Philip Schofield is far too political these days, I vote he goes back into the cupboard with   Gordon
1326902389543219200 2020-11-12 22:59:16 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Spooksy2 @MichaelYeadon3 Ok let's not compete on experts like children.  Fact is science is rather like economics, there are facts and also opinions.  I would rather listen to scientists that are free from political intervention. Scientists that advocate my freedom to listen and decide.
1326901515920023552 2020-11-12 22:55:48 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 So how will the food shortages happen I wonder?

A positive result does not mean a person has it or us infectious,  just that they have had it or one of its many close relatives in the last 6 months . The role of PCR has been criminal
1326648665201586182 2020-11-12 06:11:04 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Spooksy2 @MichaelYeadon3 The media are owned, don't expect the truth from the media. They would soon turn on this government if it deviated from it's current covid policy. That is the mistake here, do your own research, listen to qualified people,  not politicians and bent journalists.
1326645446459207688 2020-11-12 05:58:16 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> She has it so right, I mean with such overwhelming evidence why aren't more people angry?
1326639099613212672 2020-11-12 05:33:03 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Well what are the chances that happened...
1326638629985415169 2020-11-12 05:31:11 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Spooksy2 @MichaelYeadon3 Also at least 2 of those guinea pigs lost the ability to walk, they halted trials for about a week, then said it's fine nothing to see here.
1326638403643977728 2020-11-12 05:30:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Spooksy2 @MichaelYeadon3 Why would they tell us the MHRA have asked for this? As for  trials ,  just  couple of thousand people had it just a couple of months ago, how does that tell you ANYTHING about the long term effects and even the shorter term effects  This is why vaccines are tested over 7-10 yrs.
1326636519159963648 2020-11-12 05:22:48 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Frankly just a cursory look on the WEF website is enough to give a person chills, the correlation between their simulation video and current workd events is jaw dropping  . Was released 6 months BEFORE covid.
1326604762591195138 2020-11-12 03:16:37 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Hallelujah!!!
1326603774295748610 2020-11-12 03:12:41 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Spooksy2 @MichaelYeadon3 MHRA are currently advising they will need new AI software to cope with the data collection around what they predict to be a massive amount of people who will suffer adverse reactions to the new vaccine  .
1326602323527954435 2020-11-12 03:06:55 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> They want to monitor our adverse reactions to the vaccine in the interests of data, and need new software to cope with what they predict to be a huge amount of adverse vaccine reactions....
1326598645970579459 2020-11-12 02:52:18 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @VAS6323 @TechBoy_Limited Apparently most people have flu no more than a few times in their life, and it can have very serious side effects. However a lot of people think flu is not so bad and they have had it many times, they haven't.  Flu will always be a potential killer , with or without the new vac

All governments basically do what these organisations tell them to??
1326584898916847618 2020-11-12 01:57:41 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Well said
1326541605965234176 2020-11-11 23:05:39 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Flu used to be normal, not anymore.

1326537901497180168 2020-11-11 22:50:56 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Fabu_Bean I expect all those people who have lost or are losing their business,  the roof over their head, would disagree.

1326458426260680704 2020-11-11 17:35:07 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @andrew_lilico Doctors are saying logistically the vaccine will take 5 months at least to distribute.

1326296360568623104 2020-11-11 06:51:08 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> What about vast majority who are developing mental illness due to covid policy??
1326294714275033093 2020-11-11 06:44:35 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> They don't want to lower the fear. Fear makes us weak and controllable.

1326221264151867395 2020-11-11 01:52:44 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Why is our 'wonderful ' NHS treating or rather not treating , people like this?? Forget your dodgy asymptomatic positive bollocks there are people being left out who should be front of the queue!

1326195082513485826 2020-11-11 00:08:41 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> This is dreadful testing,  harvesting false positives no doubt.

1325933023041347585 2020-11-10 06:47:21 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> An enlightening read👇🏼
1325930647890878471 2020-11-10 06:37:55 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @MichaelYeadon3 Interested to know what you think about a vaccine for a virus that hasn't been isolated?? Thanks for all you contribute to fair discussion on these issues!

1325926299400081408 2020-11-10 06:20:38 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JoeieJoey Sadly yes. I fear for those people,  a vaccine normally goes through 7-10 years of testing,  this one will be tested on mass!
1325922160028815360 2020-11-10 06:04:12 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Mmm, a virus perhaps that will more badly effect those that took the vaccine for the first virus??

1325918351453982720 2020-11-10 05:49:04 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Already they are saying there is no evidence yet that the vaccine stops transmission.  Why take it then?
1325917953250963464 2020-11-10 05:47:29 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> A vaccine that we are told is amazing,  has a 90% chance of stopping a virus that you have 99.4% chance of surviving.  Still want to risk it?
1325917450941173760 2020-11-10 05:45:29 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Anyone know how this test works and its reliability,  we all know PCR is dodgy as hell .

1325858975972270082 2020-11-10 01:53:07 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @EastwoodWolf @Bret_Sears So for two years they won't really know the full consequences of the vaccine,  by which time millions will have had it. Dodgy.
1325858715132694536 2020-11-10 01:52:05 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So what,does this mean exactly?
1325858448773423105 2020-11-10 01:51:02 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 It seems daft to take the vaccine unless you are terrified of the virus.
1325812205900673024 2020-11-09 22:47:16 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Well you really can't can you, the real experiment will be after millions have had it!!

1325436704187146242 2020-11-08 21:55:10 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JoeieJoey I have listened to about 20 different scientists of eminent qualifications talk about masks causing illnesses.  This is the info upon which I protect myself and my lived ones .
1325436276833718272 2020-11-08 21:53:28 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Why is there no independent investigation into mask wearing and sickness in this country yet??? Plenty of evidence it's needed.
1325435832191377408 2020-11-08 21:51:42 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> A lot of weeks for litigation and recounts,  I wonder at what point the MSM will acknowledge the process??

1325392073990791169 2020-11-08 18:57:49 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JoeieJoey You must have seen the recent study by American health authorities,  85% of those with covid and or respiratory illness who needed hospital treatment were regular mask wearers. It's the Spanish flu all over,  50% of them scientists say were killed by bacterial lung infection
1325357717838499840 2020-11-08 16:41:18 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JoeieJoey Ask the honest Doctors who are currently treating an upturn in pleurisy amongst regular mask wearers.

1325357136608710656 2020-11-08 16:38:59 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @neety41 @DrSpock_MGBGA Not according to many scientists who are being no platformed.
1325221604700385284 2020-11-08 07:40:26 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> The media are political activists,  switch off your TV and turn on your radio to Talkradio!
1325221008949866566 2020-11-08 07:38:04 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So officially,  as confirmed below, police can't threaten to arrest someone who is exempt of wearing a mask, so why are they?
1325219344540954625 2020-11-08 07:31:27 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JoeieJoey You also know there are millions of good bacteria and millions of bad bacteria.  Don't regularly wear a mask and give yourself pleurisy!
1325216056726736899 2020-11-08 07:18:23 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> The media are controlling the world at the moment,  they have destroyed freedom and democracy.  Let's switch them off!
1325214202240389122 2020-11-08 07:11:01 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Thank goodness   there is still integrity!
1325210367228702724 2020-11-08 06:55:47 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> It's all so bloody predictable.
1325209668105367555 2020-11-08 06:53:00 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Democracy died in USA with Mail ballots and here the rot has spread  👇🏼
1325209283772997632 2020-11-08 06:51:29 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> I thought the Biden supporters stayed off the streets in respect for the virus....isn't that why Biden had no one at his rallies??? Turns out they don't care about the virus they just knew they didn't NEED to attend the rallies to galvanise support...it was all rigged.
1325207539395407878 2020-11-08 06:44:33 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Mail votes need to go back to being ONLY for those physically unable to vote on person.
1325207241742409729 2020-11-08 06:43:22 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Was it Tweedle Dum or Tweedle Dee??
1325206625422987265 2020-11-08 06:40:55 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> I think a lot of us know how to explain it.
1325204511917486085 2020-11-08 06:32:31 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> What has just happened in America,  with the full support of almost all news networks,  should be a warning to us all. Democracy is just an illusion,  unless every generation fights for it.

1325157230090444801 2020-11-08 03:24:38 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @lewis_goodall That's quite a few weeks for legal processes to take place effectively and recounts of valid ballots only,  thanks Lewis feel so much better about the situation!

1325129077154590721 2020-11-08 01:32:46 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @NikkiStix55 @gymslip Pennsylvania still in litigation and has not certified him as the winner. Until States certify the courts are obliged to to intervene.  The media is trying to pull a fast one and hoof him over the line!
1325128384276361216 2020-11-08 01:30:01 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> They are spooked, announcing him early before any state has officially certified him as winner. Much litigation in process, this is going to be lots of fun!
1325127897359659008 2020-11-08 01:28:05 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @BILDERBERG_GP @YvetteHenson The media now think they have the power to declare a president,  yet votes are still in litigation and recounts,  let the fun begin!

1325106023447863297 2020-11-08 00:01:09 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Coincidence,  don't think so.

China is the only economy doing well. Our government though does not seek to investigate china, why? Boris ignores majority of scientists , why? We are living in fear of flu, why?
1325006491712155648 2020-11-07 17:25:39 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Asymptomatic has got to be the biggest con of this whole scam, it was a tool of control nothing more,  it meant people couldn't make a decision about their own health/risk but rather it wasn't their right, as it was about others.

1324712667223937029 2020-11-06 21:58:06 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Did they fake a pandemic to get record breaking Mail ballots which are easily corruptible?
1324629467315294210 2020-11-06 16:27:30 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Suspicious
1324629360633171968 2020-11-06 16:27:04 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Your NHS does not prioritise your health, it is now a political lobbyist...

With my dogs,they both are terrible with the fireworks,  I leave them in a safe place in the house, walk away and totally ignore them. Sounds heartless but anyone with dogs knows this works best to calm them, if you make a fuss they get worse

1324454495468793856 2020-11-06 04:52:13 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Hang on , strokes and heart attacks ARE preventable when GPs take  normal appointments and refer people with worrying symptoms!!!!! What a lie.
1324453990067806209 2020-11-06 04:50:13 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @BrokenByWar My little poodle is absolutely terrified,  same as last year, shaking all over and heart racing. Bloody hate this time of year!
1324446491478511616 2020-11-06 04:20:25 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Very interesting
1324417065437040644 2020-11-06 02:23:29 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @TheTimeBubble @2112Frankie @allisonpearson That is the killer question.  Funny how Boris in his speech earlier stated a number for how many are receiving ventilation and then quickly corrected it to, in ventilator beds!!! Nurses are saying a lot of covid patients are on ventilator beds and not hooked up to ventilator!
1324370377989042176 2020-11-05 23:17:58 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @ChristineEasda1 I wonder if Boris's near death experience was a warning shot that he is all too aware of? Is he following the 'plan' to save us all from covid20, far more deadly? So many questions...
1324369670959439880 2020-11-05 23:15:09 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> If Trump is forced out by corrupt ballots, as it seems will be the case, we all better be worried.  The US is leader of the free world, if they fall in this manner, then all western democracy will follow.
1324368557271142402 2020-11-05 23:10:44 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Telegraph Sure, let's not stop more deaths say the government.
1324368040247648258 2020-11-05 23:08:41 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @mikelovestweets Yes, for some democratic voters no doubt. But I don't believe for a second that useless campaign got the highest turnout of votes ever recorded in swing states. Maybe the huge over reaction to covid,  record mail in votes(easily corruptible), was all about this moment.

1324329920902930432 2020-11-05 20:37:12 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> The reset can't happen properly without forcing Trump out. Plans were obviously laid to force a Biden win, I guess that is why they didn't bother with the rallies.
1324311025768894465 2020-11-05 19:22:07 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @mikelovestweets Everything that has been revealed about the Biden family and their financial/political links to China is enough for me to resent him. Then when you think I about him being obviously ill,  likes sniffing womens hair and generally inappropriate to women....I could go on and on
1324309851082760192 2020-11-05 19:17:27 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> We are living through what they ,WEF, call the Reset or 4th industrial revolution,  or what some of us now recognise as the 4th Reich!
1324280512614178816 2020-11-05 17:20:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Absolutely right  democracy must be protected,  if you can no longer believe in a fair vote it's game over for western civilisation as we know it.

The police man that came rnd was very aggressive and trying to get a rise out of me, it was awful. His Dad had gone to pick him up , missed him by 10 mins , only out for few hrs.
1324081549613162498 2020-11-05 04:10:16 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So this is now definitely looking like total unadulterated fraud to steal the whitehouse

1324066670441365504 2020-11-05 03:11:08 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @emmakennytv @bpbriper My 16 year old son was eating pizza with some friends and then some other friends joined them so over 6, 4 police cars and a riot van came at them and they got put in handcuffs and taken home and warned. It was extremely upsetting.  My lad has never been in trouble in his life.
1324064809558646790 2020-11-05 03:03:45 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JoeieJoey Sorry we will not agree. I am utterly appalled at what is going on with this virus and that we are now £326 billion in debt. The NHS IS finished whatever.  It can't be paid for now, it will all change and we will all pay that heavy price
1324015314376548353 2020-11-04 23:47:04 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Trump knew he would have to fight fraud in this election,  he does have a plan   https://t.co/hbxl2dWt0v

1324006441670348802 2020-11-04 23:11:49 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> They are arriving for one reason, then after multiple PCR tests eventually get found covid+, then become covid patients or deaths. The hospital is a covid machine.
1324005351390400513 2020-11-04 23:07:29 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @avocet2 @Ding7Bill Yes they are. Wonder what they are going to do to swing them away from Trump,  who was apparently winning well when they stopped counting.  Very suspicious. None of this being reported on tv though of course.

Then they live at school, I mean who needs parents,  that's what the Socialists think! Let the state just have full responsibility for all our kids..this is what Labour promote
1323981044949934083 2020-11-04 21:30:54 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JoeieJoey Absolutely sick of the obsession with covid deaths, they are far far outstripped by all other deaths and diagnoses down by 75% in some depts. No more people are dying of covid than would normally die of flu. You can stay obsessed I won't thanks.

It is because covid policy has created covidNHS!! Apparently no other death matters to the NHS.

1323749910760558592 2020-11-04 06:12:27 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JoeieJoey Most hospitals everywhere have killed people through not diagnosing,  not testing, cancelling operations. Preventable deaths from cancer, heart disease, strokes etc are right up and climbing. They will eventually far, far exceed covid deaths.

A virus is NEVER infectious when a person has zero symptoms and develops zero symptoms. If we shut down because some well people MAY become I'll then we will be destroyed.

1323701206779387906 2020-11-04 02:58:55 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JoeieJoey I don't have it wrong. It is almost impossible for a fit and well person to have enough viral load to infect anyone. I have listened to many scientists explain this and this also makes perfect logical sense.
1323693128419807232 2020-11-04 02:26:49 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JoeieJoey I disagree,  most scientists disagree but they are no platformerd by the media and government. If someone is positive asymptomatic,  they are immune and have no capacity to be infectious.  The PCR test picks up dead RNA and presents as positive.

1323586050581655552 2020-11-03 19:21:20 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> This is exactly what they are about to do in Liverpool,  where cases are falling and have been since before it went into tier 3, according to official government data.
1323585104481034241 2020-11-03 19:17:34 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @NadineDorries False positives are to be deducted from total tested NOT from positive cases. Until you start to do this everything you say is a lie.
1323581010097938434 2020-11-03 19:01:18 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> It's a total set up to propagate the casedemic.  Don't play ball.
1323529782093598720 2020-11-03 15:37:44 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Biased terror broadcasting as usual
1323529253514784769 2020-11-03 15:35:38 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Where are the poppies on TV this year???

1323527902357499904 2020-11-03 15:30:16 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @mr_squeege To think, they tell us we are doing all this to save the NHS, what a load of tripe the NHS is buggered,  we are £326 billion in debt. It will never function as it did again and the vulnerable will be most affected.
1323388241790291975 2020-11-03 06:15:18 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Ferguson's projections again, already disproved within days, why are tax payers having to pay this man to deliver his absolute shit predictions.
1323386718733639684 2020-11-03 06:09:15 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Mass testing equals much higher positive so called cases, imagine what crazy graphs will be thrown together to keep us locked up. It's certainly no way out of this scam.

1323384057443553284 2020-11-03 05:58:41 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @BenIrvineAuthor @MaizyDaizyZzzz Also they are upping testing but if R rate goes up, as it will with increased testing,  we won't open things back up and we will blame you for not abiding by the new normal
1323382792789647362 2020-11-03 05:53:39 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> One dissenting voice at least...
1323382173651652612 2020-11-03 05:51:12 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> It's all absolute boll**ks.... there is a narrative being followed,  that's why it defies real explanation
1323381629113585664 2020-11-03 05:49:02 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @ClarkeMicah @astro_trader These days if you think differently to the mainstream narrative you are labelled as bad, evil. It isn't opinions anymore,  it's good verses evil and if you aren't on the 'right'side you are fair game for vitriolic attack 😡 so so sad.
1323379653864755201 2020-11-03 05:41:11 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Knew this was why the Democrats stopped rallies but still fake poles preparing everyone for Democratic victory,  absolutely disgusting.

Why ruin a country based on a false connection. I am disgusted with the whole of parliament and look forward to Farage and his new party.

1323025575485804546 2020-11-02 06:14:12 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @YardleyShooting @bring_on_brexit Probably because they know where it came from and aren't telling us.

1322885064909299714 2020-11-01 20:55:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> My predictions for US election: 1) Trump wins landslide victory,  Democrats and BLM hit the streets commiting crimes, huge civil unrest. Or  2) Trump wins but they say Biden won, Trump voters come out in huge protests,  civil unrest. Either way it's huge. Hope Trump wins though
1322883331151826944 2020-11-01 20:48:58 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So Govnt plan.

With millions being tested on a faulty PCR test what do you think will happen to the R rate???😡😡

1322654264561442824 2020-11-01 05:38:45 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Masks are bad for us in so many ways
1322653472844644357 2020-11-01 05:35:36 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @PrimalPolitical @BW400CN Difference is we know,or rather oncologists know roughly how many people every year, doesn't vary much, get Cancer diagnosis.  From that we can compare and project reliably.
1322652891233091586 2020-11-01 05:33:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Is this going to be our way out of this nightmare,  a Chancellor that actually cares about the economy?
1322652133506908171 2020-11-01 05:30:16 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Because it isnt a vaccine,  it's something else, something that is incredibly important in order to control millions of people.
1322651071966253063 2020-11-01 05:26:03 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Gets forgotten,  particularly by journalists who get to ask questions....
1322648627450466304 2020-11-01 05:16:21 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @10DowningStreet questions, why do you calculate false positives by deducting them from those that test positive and not from total tested as you should? Why do you treat 'cases' as  sick people when 80% of those tested aren't sick or needing covid treatment? I look forward to the courts.
1322640941132533761 2020-11-01 04:45:48 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Billions of pounds spent on an institution that is supposed to protect us, now asks us to stay away as its nurses need tik tok time..

1322608768933367808 2020-11-01 02:37:58 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Basically it looks like another lockdown,  essentially we will be subject to the draconian life the Nazis failed to achieve in the 1940s, locked in our bubbles, policed by the Gestapo and castigated by our own youth! Then it was fear of death now it is fear of a virus. 😡😡

1322588872509956098 2020-11-01 01:18:54 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamesLewisGrim2 @janekin24 I wish the truth to come out,  I can't stand the lies and the fear being generated over numbers which are not even gathered by a reliable test. We are crushing a grape with a sledgehammer.
1322587459557957636 2020-11-01 01:13:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @berniespofforth @LarraineWright1 Yes that would be a bit extra in the pot for the beloved NHS, which incidentally doesn't protect our health anymore but rather we have to clap for it as the ruthless messiah it has become.
1322586656063574017 2020-11-01 01:10:05 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @markinneswilli @EssexPR Schools won't generate taxes to pay for the life you are used to. It's game over if we kick the economy again. As for the NHS its game over for that too, what are we going to use to pay for our health service.
1322585853521219584 2020-11-01 01:06:54 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamesLewisGrim2 @janekin24 I have social distanced through this entire scam, and masks when necessary.  People can do what they are asked to do and still be very angry. The test is rubbish, the lockdown is criminal and the control through fear is diabolical.
1322585052153368576 2020-11-01 01:03:43 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @mikelovestweets That is a very callous response.  Many businesses will go under, people losing everything they have including their homes but hey successful business is successful business!
1322584334507888640 2020-11-01 01:00:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamesLewisGrim2 @janekin24 I can tell by your last words you really care. I just wish the many scientists who condemn this advice and dodgy testing were allowed a voice on the TV. I can't stand the no platforming that is going on.
1322583321206022146 2020-11-01 00:56:50 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @gina2353 @HHepplewhite There are many reasons the government advisors and scientists would deceive us!!! So you actually believe the PCR is accurate and do called cases are sick people??? I am stunned. I loved Boris but unless he stops a national lockdown with these dodgy figures I am out
1322578676765069312 2020-11-01 00:38:23 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Reprobate24 I am yes. Starmer would have been even worse and even more draconian,  but still, what happened to the Tories?
1322550157901221889 2020-10-31 22:45:04 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Where indeed?
1322549606513807361 2020-10-31 22:42:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Hadn't thought about this, let's hope they fight like hell to stop this!

1322514842796830725 2020-10-31 20:24:44 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamesLewisGrim2 @janekin24 It is a dirty rag within 20 mins of putting on unless it is medical grade. It suppresses the immune system, it can even cause retro viruses,   viruses you had and conquered coming back to life. Don't believe me fine. But after listening to many scientists talk I want fresh air.
1322513875128995840 2020-10-31 20:20:53 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamesLewisGrim2 @janekin24 We have ALWAYS lived with the seasonal threat of flu, and yes it can kill and yes it can sometimes make the healthy very ill and rarely, even die. So why are you NOW happy to shut down the western world, end the NHS that saved your life (no money), just to be righteous?
1322512937379090438 2020-10-31 20:17:10 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Scam numbers
1322512619945807877 2020-10-31 20:15:54 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @mikelovestweets And how much will their business gain from the misery and destruction of yet another series of western lockdowns??? We think Amazon are the solution,  but maybe their political lobbying is part of the problem.
1322511505636687872 2020-10-31 20:11:28 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Look what the political classes are doing to people 👇🏼
1322508618541998084 2020-10-31 20:00:00 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> We need more voices like this..
1322506794032340997 2020-10-31 19:52:45 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JuliaHB1 Ask them Julia on your show, why they are deducting the false positives from the positive case numbers and NOT as they should , from the total tested !? The first makes little difference to numbers the second destroys 'case'numbers.
1322505795196669952 2020-10-31 19:48:47 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> If only this were true ....

1322505340936769537 2020-10-31 19:46:58 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Rossva1189 @LBC Do you have any theories as to why he left the hospital a different man?
1322505057930272768 2020-10-31 19:45:51 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AeHcat It seems like they don't even care what people think and aren't even fighting to win like Trump is. I fear they have a plan to steal the election and bring down the free world, I know that sounds crazy but they seem convinced they will win despite the obvious lack of support 😕
1322459494698356737 2020-10-31 16:44:48 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AeHcat I predict the election will either be rigged against Trump or suspended
1322459036353253377 2020-10-31 16:42:59 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @LBC Boris Johnson is no longer Boris Johnson,  I voted for a man that disappeared when he left his hospital bed
1322457972023324672 2020-10-31 16:38:45 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @flowesaunders68 @danwootton Great excuse to suspend or cancel the election, we all know the Democrats can't win a clean victory,  or even commit the greatest democratic fraud on the free world.
1322457427229507584 2020-10-31 16:36:35 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> When he nearly died was that a warning shot that he must take our country down a planned route of destruction.  He certainly came out of hospital a completely different person .
1322456109744082945 2020-10-31 16:31:21 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamesHenryBush I don't think it will end because the  virus is not the problem

Feel superior in your contempt of people like me. I don't care.
1322450851336802306 2020-10-31 16:10:27 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamesLewisGrim2 @janekin24 Lol it is not God that will protect me , it is my immune system. You have learnt to have no faith in your immune system, I have not. Last time I checked we were a free country still, so don't dictate that I should wear a dirty rag across my face when I have the sense not to.
1322310597657141249 2020-10-31 06:53:08 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamesLewisGrim2 @janekin24 Keep wearing your mask,  but don't do it to protect me, I have an immune system that will protect me, as long as I breathe like God intended.
1322307158965452801 2020-10-31 06:39:28 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamesMelville Are they losing their minds or following the WEF reset plan on their website?

1322302948731441156 2020-10-31 06:22:44 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> We need to be economically destroyed not on life support! Also USA needs to fall as leader of the free world, so they have to destroy Trump at the election,  easier to do under world lockdown
1322300950216847366 2020-10-31 06:14:48 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @danwootton Dan please ask the question why are Ministers and government scientists subtracting the rate of false positives from the number of positive tests and not from the total numbers tested??? It's a killer question that blows 'cases' apart!
1322300476331827200 2020-10-31 06:12:55 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @danwootton Nothing to do with the American election at start of November???
1322298634994634753 2020-10-31 06:05:36 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Just turned the damn thing off as each one of them made a slam at Trump, laughing and taking the Mickey out of him. Just like they all did with Brexit,  they must be vetted for far left views or stupidity!
1322296869888905222 2020-10-31 05:58:35 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Good question,  do some lives matter and others not, is that the new normal?

1322293295838646279 2020-10-31 05:44:23 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> We all need to pray Trump wins, if he loses then the Democrats will bring down America as leader of the free world,  then the world economic forum plan begins. Be scared.
1322292681708621824 2020-10-31 05:41:56 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @DailyMailUK They really want this lockdown that isn't necessary,  why?
1322292117616644097 2020-10-31 05:39:42 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamesLewisGrim2 @janekin24 They aren't even wearing proper masks, just cotton , full of bacteria within minutes, hardly medical grade. Constantly touching it, grabbing it . It's scandalous that we know half the dead during the Spanish flu were mask wearing  and got bacterial lung infections and yet

1322147759147962370 2020-10-30 20:06:04 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamesLewisGrim2 @janekin24 Masks deplete oxygen,  this longterm depletes the immune system . Added to that bacteria very quickly collects in the moist warm mask, you are inhaling that bacteria   some people for hours. Eventually the immune system cannot cope and you get bacterial lung infections

Much evidence to suggest that most went in hospital with another illness and then got tested and BECAME a covid patient despite not being ill with it
1321507446121205764 2020-10-29 01:41:42 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Thousands of scientists from the best universities in the world are being ignored and Doctors are being effectively told to ignore everything they learned about viruses and how to best save lives...something is VERY BADLY WRONG!
1321506896289910784 2020-10-29 01:39:31 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @MOB51 @JamesDelingpole @Sozzinski I suppose since the media got owned by accepting money from international organisations and globalists??
1321504108482863107 2020-10-29 01:28:26 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @salus_pop @JuliaHB1 No it didn't.  For example scientists now know that at least half of the people who died in the Spanish flu actually died from bacterial lung disease caused by....wearing masks....yet we are told to wear masks as if that lesson had not been learnt!
1321232389948002311 2020-10-28 07:28:43 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @salus_pop @JuliaHB1 That viruses EVER have a second peak, they don't.  First year media school stuff
1321232124356268037 2020-10-28 07:27:40 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @salus_pop Mentioning something,  that is actually huge, is not the same as  drumming home the point!

1321226366503784457 2020-10-28 07:04:47 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JuliaHB1 Julia, please get Michael Yeadon onto talkradio for interview on covid19 and his opposition to the statements of so called facts from his old work colleague Vallance! Vallance never calls Yeadon out, why, because he knows he is right!

1321156324835631104 2020-10-28 02:26:28 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Max_reflect Because covid19 has not been isolated,  it is a scam , the test is totally abused against its original purpose.  If people stopped getting tested it would all disappear.
1321155750522179586 2020-10-28 02:24:11 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Absolutely true, we had one child because kids are expensive and we felt we could afford just one. So why do some people on benefits think it everyone elses job to pay for their kids as then have one after another, unable to support them??

However they can't explain the obvious fact that rather than local economy (supermarket) getting those sales Amazon get them instead!
1320272048715956225 2020-10-25 15:52:40 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> They are even tampering with historical figures now to boost the belief in the fake pandemic.

The reset is essentially the bringing down of world economies and resetting them to a new world order. It is  thought the Reset is being planned on the back of the virus.

1319394423936004099 2020-10-23 05:45:18 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @KernowMaiden It feels like a communist takeover
1319388353301807104 2020-10-23 05:21:11 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @NadineDorries Sorry but while you are testing millions of perfectly well people and then pronouncing them as cases because your dodgy PCR test is on too higher revolutions and picking up old DNA remnants, I can't take a single word as the truth from this sham.

1319275787703386112 2020-10-22 21:53:53 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Strange how everything we are now expected to do , distancing, masks,  flu jab, is all for the sake of someone other than ourselves . Anyone would think it all must be bad for us!👇🏼
1319274372822040578 2020-10-22 21:48:16 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> We have always cared about the economy more than flu, so what is wrong with people stating that the economy is STILL the backbone of everything we take for granted 👇🏼

1318310163263197186 2020-10-20 05:56:50 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @PaulAndersonNE6 There are so many plays on words and stats at the moment.
1318309390806646789 2020-10-20 05:53:46 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @NadineDorries Same with flu  over 60s at risk, in a free country we inform/advise  and then let people choose their own path. Thousands of people are dying every week,  but not from covid,  but no one cares about those lives.
1318303345853988865 2020-10-20 05:29:45 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @theepictetus @DerekCoates @NadineDorries Asymptomatic people are IMMUNE! Why is that so hard for people to accept??? People with no symptoms Don't make anyone sick even the corrupt WHO admits  this. Please be more critical of the rubbish being peddled and listen also to the MANY eminent scientists calling this out!
1318302367281041411 2020-10-20 05:25:51 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Fed up with Sky, they report cases as if medically sick, they say ICUs at 84% capacity without stating this as normal in October and also that 42% in ICU are 'with" covid which means nothing about why they are really actually in ICU, just positive . Am sick of this manipulation😡
1318268348988334083 2020-10-20 03:10:41 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @BritishnProud_ Me too. So many brainwashed just accepting the diet of fear and lies 😕

And statistically,  most people who are positive have no symptoms whatsoever,  but like I said if something else kills them covid is still put on their death certificate and they are counted as a covid death. There is a virus,  and like flu the old can get it bad.
1318251265114210305 2020-10-20 02:02:48 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @theepictetus @DerekCoates @NadineDorries Why is it likely covid19 caused the stroke if they die of a stroke and have no covid symptoms?? How can a virus that gives you zero symptoms ever be the cause of your death. It is utterly beyond me what people believe when they are brainwashed
1318242763633287168 2020-10-20 01:29:01 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @theepictetus @DerekCoates @NadineDorries Rubbish. I have seen death certificates, they have primary reason for death and mention other illnesses further down. Most covid deaths have a primary reason, say head trauma then further down mention covid + . died of a car crash but as covid+  its classesd as a covid death

If we did this the figures would fall through the floor.

1317899096439607296 2020-10-19 02:43:24 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @NadineDorries I suppose it would if you continue with the statedy of counting ALL DEATHS as covid deaths if had a +pcr test within 28 days of dying!!! It isn't difficult,  if a person dies of something other than symptomatic  covid then they are NOT a covid death. So simple yet NOT happening!

1317784709611606016 2020-10-18 19:08:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @KirstieMAllsopp And all because of a virus with the death rate of 0.05% (WHO FIGURE), that kills people on average aged 82.5yrs, older than average age of death.
1317783478512111616 2020-10-18 19:03:59 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> This is truly shocking,  to lie and manipulate millions of people with these false figures into masks,  lockdown,  closures and even death is FASCISM

1317117162407010305 2020-10-16 22:56:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @MattHancock This could all stop if you stopped testing the fit and well, no more casedemic,  a stop to over inflated hospitalization figures and deaths even . If someone is in hospital with heart failure and no covid symptoms they aren't covid patient whatever the test says or a covid death

I don't expect the government to stop me catching it and possibly being ill.  As for NHS many amazing people,  corrupt systems.

All lockdown is a catastrophic price to many many people.

1317047976418828288 2020-10-16 18:21:21 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @chairmick All these people thinking he is a national hero as he listed all the dire consequences of lockdown,  and then he adds at the end he backs a national lockdown!

1317047174367248386 2020-10-16 18:18:10 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @SamBuist @RogerJa32507174 @AndyBurnhamGM @DominicRaab Agree, local lockdown doesn't work but neither will another national 'circuit breaker'. It would be catastrophic for millions of people and achieve zero. No one can present any evidence atall that circuit breaker will do anything positive.
1317046701631393793 2020-10-16 18:16:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @SamBuist @AndyBurnhamGM @DominicRaab Agree it shouldn't be focused on one part of the country but disagree entirely that it should happen atall.

Hospitalised and death figures are people who have ANY illness but test positive within 28days of death/admissions.  It's a scam!
1317035908336672768 2020-10-16 17:33:24 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @chairmick Did you watch the unedited version of his speech or just the clipped bit Sky showed?
1317035622742282241 2020-10-16 17:32:16 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> People stop telling me we need a lockdown because it saves lives!!! It also ends many other lives. It ends careers, companies,  investments,  jobs, marriages.  Even WHO now saying this cure is worse than the illness! This is insanity. Please people go on the ONS do your own study
1317034819558232065 2020-10-16 17:29:04 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @ColinEv61465093 @AndyBurnhamGM @DominicRaab You can't beat a virus by locking people away, it spreads anyway within households and designated shops and work etc. We can travel to the moon but we are not grasping basic principles here. Not to mention WHO now says lockdown is wrong and fatality is 0.05%, less than flu!!
1317034132464144384 2020-10-16 17:26:21 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @niccijane2000 @janekin24 @AndyBurnhamGM @DominicRaab Yes and then at the end says he supports national lockdown,  with all the suffering he highlights in his speech h that lockdown causes. Pathetic. Have you watched the unedited version or just what Sky showed?
1317033737742393345 2020-10-16 17:24:47 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @StephenSociali1 @AndyBurnhamGM @DominicRaab Yes, remind me when is the Manchester Mayoral election, Spring????
1317033528341704705 2020-10-16 17:23:57 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Not twisted his words, he says he is against local lockdown and highlights all the suffering lockdown causes , then advocates national lockdown,  pretty pathetic!
1317033192008912902 2020-10-16 17:22:36 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @SamBuist @AndyBurnhamGM @DominicRaab That is very defeatist,  why not support instead NO lockdowns of any description.  They don't work, they cause deaths and suicides that are otherwise avoidable,  they cause economic catastrophe for many not to mention divorces and losing homes.
1317032471041593344 2020-10-16 17:19:45 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @ColinEv61465093 @AndyBurnhamGM @DominicRaab Is he also right about all the economic suffering lockdown causes??
1317025043470311424 2020-10-16 16:50:14 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CllrBSilvester Why did this story disappear so quickly I wonder?

1317024339750014980 2020-10-16 16:47:26 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AndyBurnhamGM @DominicRaab Problem is Andy you want a national lockdown which would mean all the bad things you mention in your speech for everyone.  You are a contradiction. How can you highlight all of that suffering lockdown causes and also advocate national lockdown???!!
1317022451591688192 2020-10-16 16:39:56 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @PaulaBrexiteer On one hand it is bad because it is an effort, like Starmer in parliament,  to force a national lockdown.  However,  it is I hope going to have the effect of galvanising tory opposition to all lockdowns. Tories would look weak now if there was a circuit breaker.

1317014143812227073 2020-10-16 16:06:55 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @montie @SuzanneEvans1 Agree. The lawyers are already on the case, hence WHO sudden about turn on lockdown and fatality now est at 0.05%!!
1317013221761581057 2020-10-16 16:03:15 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @GowTolson @errjustsaying I see on sky last night they edited his speech to remove what he said at the end, that he supported Starmer and his call for a national lockdown!

1316851340258181122 2020-10-16 05:20:00 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @KevinMale5 @EssexPR Yes and death total includes ALL deaths that had a positive test within 28 days, could have died of absolutely anything!

1316109887592640519 2020-10-14 04:13:43 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @RealRLimbaugh @presh_beagle Was a brilliant speech
1316106193576898561 2020-10-14 03:59:03 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamesCranworth @pinklippy @talkRADIO @MattHancock @HouseofCommons I suspect you are right, especially the criminal bit!
1316105650561323009 2020-10-14 03:56:53 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @RobsBottin80 @UKCovid19Stats They never tell you that bit!
1316093621008035841 2020-10-14 03:09:05 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @gasdoc1982 @Manda251 @JulieAdmin @10DowningStreet I think this is more than counterbalanced by the 300% increase in so called cases!!!
1316084813024161792 2020-10-14 02:34:05 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @or_dodo Some very important points in that speech,  like how many hospital patients with covid positive are actually in hospital for covid symptoms/treatment? There could be many asymptomatic positives who are in hospital for other treatments/illnesses.
1316081268774309891 2020-10-14 02:20:00 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @theorphanmoon68 @pinklippy If you wear the cotton ones it could be small fibres getting into your lungs. Try not to wear it when possible.
1316080988171177986 2020-10-14 02:18:53 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @PHIL_BERT And they said there was no cure for flu, yet here it is!!!😡
1316080771870924801 2020-10-14 02:18:02 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @LoyalDefender2K Well said. I often think he has Tony Blair in his ear, and his globalist institution.
1316080178221780992 2020-10-14 02:15:40 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @ruthie5_g @NadineDorries I hope they start to listen to people like you, you don't deserve to be ordered round like a child, you can make your own decisions according to your own circumstances and views.x
1316079425709133824 2020-10-14 02:12:41 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @gasdoc1982 @Manda251 @JulieAdmin @10DowningStreet False negative doesn't matter, if you get badly sick you go to hospital anyway, having stayed home while I'll. False positives are a game changer, many thousands having to lock away for weeks for no reason and all their household.
1316078247600427009 2020-10-14 02:08:00 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamessReality @re11ddy And wasn't that what we were told the plan was? The nightingale hospitals seem to be nothing more than an idle threat
1316078004179697671 2020-10-14 02:07:02 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JamessReality It would seem only covid19 deaths matter now
1316076545048444930 2020-10-14 02:01:14 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlbertoThomas So now we know why WHO have backtracked,  must know the evidence against them is substantial!
1316075733773692928 2020-10-14 01:58:01 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @CovidSenseBloke Who are these scientists trying to kid, all it will do is push the deaths back by a fortnight.  Or are they hoping like last time they can force the government,  with more bullshit statistics,  to stay in lockdown?
1315930554425135104 2020-10-13 16:21:07 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Aprobateti @isnt_it_red @ClarkeMicah I am struggling with Boris and apparently he is resisting sage, who want a national lockdown!
1315929869289762816 2020-10-13 16:18:24 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @gasdoc1982 @Manda251 @JulieAdmin @10DowningStreet All tests have false results,  yes,  PCR wasn't even created as a diagnostic,  it is not a test for any live or infectious virus! Its creator Mullis stated it must never be used to test for illnesses as it will find whatever you are looking for if you put it on a high enough rev
1315928359197605889 2020-10-13 16:12:24 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @NadineDorries You are expecting us ALL to live in incubators!!! Over 60s should decide for themselves what action to take and should be financially supported in their decision,  as should the vulnerable.  Life must go on or else it isn't worth living.
1315926931259432965 2020-10-13 16:06:43 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @PaulaBrexiteer I have read opposite reports, that those who took the flu vaccine last autumn were worst hit by covid

1315784070996070401 2020-10-13 06:39:03 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @wemustleave1 This woman has lost the plot. Would she defend this man if it had been her pregnant belly he had held a gun to?
1315781389632122886 2020-10-13 06:28:23 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @6631andrew @ClarkeMicah YES!!! Easy to say you are at full capacity if you only 'allocate' 8 beds for covid19 patients!
1315781105652563969 2020-10-13 06:27:16 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Aprobateti @isnt_it_red @ClarkeMicah They are probably asymptomatic positives with other symptomatic medical needs, placed in covid beds as covid patients.
1315780565841448961 2020-10-13 06:25:07 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So if you are in a 'ventilator bed' but  not on a ventilator you are counted as a ventilator patient!
1315780211967918082 2020-10-13 06:23:43 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @ClarkeMicah @Marion56728932 Apparently itv are saying Birmingham Royal is at full capacity,  yet it's been said that actually they allocated 8 beds in ICU for covid and THOSE beds are full and not the ICu unit which has 670 beds!
1315778696926629891 2020-10-13 06:17:41 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @itvnews Are they the covid allocated beds, 8, or the other 670 beds left?
1315778379279462405 2020-10-13 06:16:26 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So how many other hospitals claiming ICU at full capacity or near to it, are merely referring to their allocated beds for covid19 being full??? What a scam...
1315775031062994947 2020-10-13 06:03:07 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @gasdoc1982 @Manda251 @JulieAdmin @10DowningStreet Either the test works and we are not being manipulated or the test is a sham and we are being manipulated.
1315748436227039240 2020-10-13 04:17:27 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @HollieTheCard @NikkiStix55 I am talking out of educating myself having watched many hours of virologists and epidemiology experts discuss this on podcasts. Not to mention trawling over NHS and ONS stats.
1315747508270911488 2020-10-13 04:13:46 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @DOckerby1 Wish he was my Mayor!
1315746445199396864 2020-10-13 04:09:32 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @NikkiStix55 @HollieTheCard I feel the same,  from every graph regarding this virus,  that I have looked at we are reacting hugely disproportionately.  Also CDC now admit masks promote sickness,  80% of current cases are people who regularly wear masks. Pcr test is a sham. Cases are not sick people.
1315743277942009858 2020-10-13 03:56:57 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @spikedonline @jacksweynseye Just like the nazis suppressed news/journalists
1315740443397754882 2020-10-13 03:45:41 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JuliaHB1 What on earth is going on. This makes NO sense to anyone with half a brain, what is REALLY being addressed by these restrictions?
1315739645976678401 2020-10-13 03:42:31 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @MattHancock Schools getting shut by PHE testing the fit and well finding asymptomatic false positives. The economy is trashed. The NHS  will never function as it was again as ,again, the economy is trashed.  Stop obsessing with the covid PCR positive,  many not even ill, this is a casedemic
1315721144381644804 2020-10-13 02:29:00 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @talkRADIO @THEJamesWhale @BorisJohnson What are the stats regarding so called cases having or leading to symptoms?
1315717389439434752 2020-10-13 02:14:05 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @gasdoc1982 @Manda251 @JulieAdmin @10DowningStreet If they end up in ICU and still test negative then they definitely haven't got it.

1315696693095038976 2020-10-13 00:51:50 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So what did I learn today, well Andy Burnham in Manchester told the government to get lost with their  economy busting lockdown but good old Anderson in Liverpool rolled out the red carpet. Red being communist!
1315692288895602694 2020-10-13 00:34:20 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @ElectionMapsUK @RichardHilton1 I think it is down to the local Mayor,  they either agree to a lockdown tier jump or they don't.  Liverpool had been asking for one for ages, back in the summer!@! Easy pickings for the government.
1315686490530349064 2020-10-13 00:11:18 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @gasdoc1982 @Manda251 @JulieAdmin @10DowningStreet It isn't usually an issue unless they end up in hospital
1315667721019944960 2020-10-12 22:56:43 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AnilaDhami He hasn't told is how many of them went in with covid19!!!  Expect the majority are unwell with other illnesses and got a false positive with the compulsory tests
1315652321632817154 2020-10-12 21:55:31 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @DavdotFo @cricketwyvern Back on standby for all the thousands of asymptomatic false positive patients!!

Your type like to put everyone in a box that they can dismiss as idiotic. Have you watched and listened to the podcasts and videos on WEF????
1315632955797188609 2020-10-12 20:38:34 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @ShellySimpson67 @sandieshoes The NHS wouldn't have me, I am no good at lying!

1315628656199430144 2020-10-12 20:21:29 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @stacetheace72 @RogerHelmerMEP @PaulStonehous15 We have had 4 years of that
1315628315898777600 2020-10-12 20:20:08 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @MinistryDissent Indeed, I know a few people who tested positive,  none were unwell. I don't know anyone that had to go to hospital with it and neither does anyone I know.

1315573395686395907 2020-10-12 16:41:54 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @sandieshoes @ShellySimpson67 I say again, confirmed covid patients are merely those that test positive.  This is still not evidence that they have symptoms let alone their treatment is for covid.  Why are you so trusting of what has already been exposed by PHE policy to be corrupt?
1315572263941529601 2020-10-12 16:37:24 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> The people strike back against globalist world agenda!!

We need to protect those that need/want protecting and get out there and live with this virus that has the same death rate now as flu!
1315569870180945920 2020-10-12 16:27:53 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @sandieshoes @ShellySimpson67 @allisonpearson Yes but are they treating symptoms of covid or are the ventilated patients mainly in hospital getting treatment for other illnesses? Once patient tests positive,  whatever they are in hospital for, they become a covid patient statistic. It's absolutely criminal.
1315568942577061888 2020-10-12 16:24:12 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @HegKong @SusanHu25307477 Look on world economic forum website,  it's all there

1315548664727830528 2020-10-12 15:03:38 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @TheoWil01633736 @WendyAnnAger @BlueArmyFaction Of course figures are falsified. PHE just confirmed flu and covid figures are to be conflated. Hospital figures are massaged by testing for asymptomatic positives amongst people who are there for other medical reasons. We all know PCR provides lots of false positives.
1315547796293005313 2020-10-12 15:00:10 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @TheoWil01633736 @WendyAnnAger @BlueArmyFaction NHS has never been anywhere near over loaded and what were the Nightingales built for? Covid19 accounts for a tiny fraction of total daily deaths, we need to protect the majority and open our hospitals properly and stop testing asymptomatic
1315545499097796610 2020-10-12 14:51:03 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @boblister_poole I live in a village in Merseyside,  used to be Lancashire before they changed the borders. I have seen nothing but compliance to all the rules, full of lefties who love a lockdown,  masks   everything.  The rule breakers are a tiny fraction,  as they are most places.

The biggest info has become  apparent as he charged the muppets out of the forum. I don't think you can be critical about his info unless you are party to it!!!!

1314980350146347008 2020-10-11 01:25:21 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @cherbic555 Yes. All this testing, 250000 a day over 1.5 million a week, 6m a month. Then those that get a positive test that then happen to need hospital, for whatever reason, within 28 days of test counted as a covid hospitalisation!!! Casedemic.

I haven't read anything he has predicted so far and then concluded he was wrong later on. I also haven't seen the info he gives anywhere else.

1314841472970248192 2020-10-10 16:13:30 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Would love someone to compare how many people under the age of 50 died OF covid compared to how many under that age died OF flu? I expect flu kills more of the fit and healthy but would live to see if I am right.

1314835637028216837 2020-10-10 15:50:18 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @WendyAnnAger @BlueArmyFaction So how can covid keep spreading, despite measures, and flu all but gone?

1314687931651686402 2020-10-10 06:03:23 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @davidkurten Yes and when those  now millions of people,  end up in hospital for all the many medical diseases and illnesses happen to people, they are counted as covid hospitalizations!
1314686604636717058 2020-10-10 05:58:06 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @NadineDorries @sandieshoes If you weren't doing  250 000 tests a day producing up to 90% false positives,  mostly asymptomatic,  then those testing positive that end up in hospital due to other medical conditions,  wouldn't be counted as covid hospitalizations! You are literally creating a casedemic

1314630245622910976 2020-10-10 02:14:09 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Hancock on talkradio,  compares the 7 thousand scientists that signed a letter to government to end lockdown, to scientists that think smoking doesn't cause cancer!!! What an arrogant twerp.  The scientists were merely pointing out all the many other deaths caused by lockdown.

1314332407319928832 2020-10-09 06:30:39 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So what a waste of money the nightingale hospitals were/are. There is no intention to free up the NHS and restore normal care!
1314332089836339201 2020-10-09 06:29:23 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @johnredwood Exactly the point of nightingale hospitals and yet it doesn't happen.  Either they are a stunt that was and is not necessary or there is no intention to solve the problem of covid19 patient numbers and affects on our NHS.

1314179929316171778 2020-10-08 20:24:46 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Fabu_Bean There are ALWAYS people that die of flu that wouldn't be e expected to. What matters is what are the vast majority of deaths, who are they and why. You can't create policy around the unlikely.
1314179328150831104 2020-10-08 20:22:22 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Just been on the WEF Site, World  Economic Forum.  Definitely a chilling explanation for everything that is to come on the back of the so called pandemic. There is a plan, govnts are all playing their part with the grand reset, as they call it. There is no conspiracy,  it's real!

1313973750161956864 2020-10-08 06:45:29 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @thetruebluechef Good question,  how many over 80s with comorbidities do you see in pubs etc?? It's crazy.

1313964470297858049 2020-10-08 06:08:36 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So, who has,a life that matters to western governments? People over 80 with serious morbidity?  Or people dying of cancer, heart disease, stroke, basically all the major diseases that kill most of us before our time if not treated . Why do the majority no longer count?
1313961584180572160 2020-10-08 05:57:08 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @DailyMailUK Why close down pubs and restaurants,  the highest rates of serious incidence are old people's homes and hospitals. Why not just tell the nation the truth, who and how this virus worse affects. This is insane.

I cannot see how the NHS will ever be the same again. Many sevices will go, many small practices will shut, many people will die. And we did it to ourselves.

Your PCR test is on 45 revolutions when it should be on 30, this promotes false positives. You are allowing  deaths to be counted multiple times. IT IS A SCAM!
1313224977886347268 2020-10-06 05:10:07 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So you can no longer request an autopsy or prevent a cremation of a loved one who died from/with covid19....scarey shit!

1313064340006858753 2020-10-05 18:31:48 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @anthonysargean2 As cases figures are so far apart from death figures,  around 300% higher,  why oh why are we using cases to drive policy???? I expect if we went back to only testing those with the symptoms of covid then cases would fall through the floor.
1312870937038131206 2020-10-05 05:43:18 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @DonjiaB @afneil @RogTallbloke Yes. Taiwan tried to warn us all about this virus back in Dec when WHO still in denial and aiding the spread. I got to say I admire Trump for pulling funding and hope Boris sticks to his plan to withhold funding until WHO investigate china.

It is a pretty breathtaking analysis of events and he is a very successful high ranking lawyer. I am convinced that China has abused and used all our international organisations via money,  with the goal to break western economies and societies .

1312165061071233025 2020-10-03 06:58:24 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Why are we still allowing R rate to dictate covid19 policy? This made sense back in spring because the infection rate closely related to death rate. Now infection is 300% higher than death rate. If we just tested the sick, as before it would fall and match death rate.

1312052753477271555 2020-10-02 23:32:07 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @steveanne01 @MissSpectaclesh @taracartergmc @Klaatus_mate @lehane_tony Good old covid only NHS! God help any of us that get sick with anything else, and as covid19 was 24th on list of things killing us , that is a lot of people getting missed!!!
1312020944215592960 2020-10-02 21:25:43 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Reuters Why don't we ever get the stats on how many of these people are asymptomatic??
1312019624330919937 2020-10-02 21:20:29 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @johnbakie @SandraG41757906 @itvnews @PrueLeith Exactly.  We can do this right is what I am saying,  we are not a backward tin pot country where the law is meaningless
1312008056474079232 2020-10-02 20:34:31 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @HegKong @MaizyDaizyZzzz Yes why are cases reported to infer sick people,  most are asymptomatic now that they are mass testing the fit and well.
1312006863731527682 2020-10-02 20:29:46 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @NikkiStix55 @PaulaBrexiteer Because he is a spiteful person, only someone on the left would be this vitriolic
1312005570103332865 2020-10-02 20:24:38 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JuliaHB1 He has no symptoms,  how will there be complications.  A test should not show positive until there is enough viral load to be symptomatic,  unless immune.
1312004703308439552 2020-10-02 20:21:11 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @johnbakie @SandraG41757906 @itvnews @PrueLeith This is not a 3rd world country,  the law would be clearly defined for Doctors and consultants to abide by. The law would only apply to strictly dying patients who are on end of life treatment. I am Christian and I have no issue atall in aiding a peaceful, inevitable death.
1312003686332276736 2020-10-02 20:17:09 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @DeanBaileynorth Barnier gave it to Boris,  probably deliberately.  As for trump the PCR can provide a positive to most people if it goes through enough revolutions.
1311951383940263936 2020-10-02 16:49:19 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @rumathom @johnbakie @SandraG41757906 @itvnews @PrueLeith I think people can't understand the horror of it until it happens to them or someone they love. Once it has happened you have no doubt that it is wrong NOT to ease someone's death.
1311948403811782661 2020-10-02 16:37:28 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Rjn552 No he isn't.  I think he will campaign from home, this is the age of tech afterall.
1311947977687281665 2020-10-02 16:35:47 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @johnbakie @SandraG41757906 @itvnews @PrueLeith You haven't killed someone if they beg for their horrendous life to be cut short by a week ! If someone is terminal and dying as stated by 2 doctors and months of failed treatment and sad scans, and suffering terribly, and wishes for it to end peacefully,  that is not murder.
1311947161161142272 2020-10-02 16:32:32 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Rjn552 Yes and what are the chances of Trump, a 74 yr old, testing asymptomatic positive at this point in the debates scheduled?? As Kary Mullis,  inventor of PCR stated,  if you want a positive you can find it!!
1311946456044113920 2020-10-02 16:29:44 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @MHKiwi @WestminsterWAG @POTUS @JoeBiden They were both tested prior to the debate as was everyone present. Trump said this during the debate when asked about masks, no one there denied that was true.
1311946079051673605 2020-10-02 16:28:14 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @WestminsterWAG @POTUS @JoeBiden Trump was tested before the debate, as was everyone present, they were all negative
1311944384779255808 2020-10-02 16:21:30 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So what are the chances of Trump having received a positive covid19 test while having no symptoms atall, just at the time the Democrats are desperate to stop any future  live debates since Trump smashed Biden at the first one!!!????🤔

1311773744130592770 2020-10-02 05:03:26 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @maisie_toby @itvnews @mikelovestweets @PrueLeith I don't believe euthanasia does happen, not in uk. The law is extremely strict.  I just wish that when someone is clinically dying that if they are suffering they could have a choice as long as they are sound of mind.

1311738800545107968 2020-10-02 02:44:35 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @maisie_toby @itvnews @mikelovestweets @PrueLeith Agree, it's all about choice. My Dad begged the Doctor to give him a lethal dose every time she visited,  I would cry myself to sleep having to see such long drawn out suffering.  I wouldn't watch my dog die like that, indeed I would probably be arrested for cruelty if I did!
1311736890786222082 2020-10-02 02:37:00 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @johnbakie @SandraG41757906 @itvnews @PrueLeith I hope you never have to suffer a terrible drawn out death or watch someone you love die a long long excruciating death. I have watched my Dad die VERY slowly,  it will haunt me forever .
1311736235057176577 2020-10-02 02:34:23 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @itvnews @mikelovestweets @PrueLeith I admire her strength in speaking about this, my Dad died a long drawn out death, essentially starved to death and probably weighed less than 6 stone when he went. It needn't have been like that , he was terminally ill and was dying why did he not get to die peacefully?
1311675381909422083 2020-10-01 22:32:35 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @BreesAnna Twitter has blocked it
1311670580073070592 2020-10-01 22:13:30 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @SkyNews And what is the increase in testing over the same period? One figure means nothing without the other
1311428999537664001 2020-10-01 06:13:33 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @NatOwens3 @donaldpenman2 I hate confrontation,  so I chicken out and wear my mask but below my nose so I can breathe normally. I don't believe they stop us getting sick,  quite the opposite,  they make us more likely to get ill. I was once shouted at to adjust my mask over my nose, so I just left.

1311420072313978881 2020-10-01 05:38:04 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So is this why Bide8blue eyes went dark at the debate??
1311416219845693442 2020-10-01 05:22:46 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So which is true, we are about to walk away or to give EU a other 3 years emptying away our waters???

So people saying they got this message in parts of Wales, Scotland , NW, Nottinghamshire.  Either it's a unauthorised mistake or half the country is getting shut down!

1311402403049201667 2020-10-01 04:27:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @FarleyP @FatEmperor Mmmm. And now they are finding asymptomatic positives in SW after embarrassingly low infection rate after a summer of mass holidays!
1311402061746053127 2020-10-01 04:26:30 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @StVitusDance Mass testing of asymptomatic. They will do this region by region.  Shutting schools as they go over too many fit and well pupils at school testing positive! My sons school shut after such testing last week all asymptomatic and now my nephews. So so angry .

1311386963799412737 2020-10-01 03:26:31 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @ajw23003 Guess that means we are going to get some pretty tough restrictions in NW announced soon. My sons school shut days ago and my nephews school shut today,  both due to handful of asymptomatic positives!
1311385689855012864 2020-10-01 03:21:27 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @LozzaFox @PennyMidasRollo They are harvesting false positives.  My son's school and also my nephews school nearby have both been shut down due to a handful of asymptomatic false positives.  Now Hancock in talks in Liverpool to increase restrictions to merseyside due to school closures!!
1311384981063827461 2020-10-01 03:18:38 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @LeadingEwe Or a stitch up because of SW embarrassingly low figures,  despite 100s of thousands arriving for holidays in summer! It's a loophole in the narrative that needs dealing with.
1311381167824932867 2020-10-01 03:03:29 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Well I am in NW and just got a text message from my chemist to say expect disruption to service and order and collect your prescriptions asap. So I guess we are going into a lockdown, Hancock is currently in Liverpool talking to leftie Mayor and councillors about new restrictions

1310625772428840963 2020-09-29 01:01:49 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @RogerGalligan I take my lessons on the validity of the tests listening to the scientists that worked with Kary  Mullis the inventor of the PCR testing,  which was never intended for infectious diagnosis. They ridicule the use of PCR with an infectious virus .
1310624901863276546 2020-09-29 00:58:21 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @MartynShannon2 @LBC @NIAbbot High cases doesn't mean high illnesses,  a lot of so called cases are asymptomatic or mild. The crux of the situation is hospital admissions and deaths from community not nursing homes. Nursing homes are a separate situation as they are separated from the community.

1310329398843899904 2020-09-28 05:24:08 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @NikkiStix55 So I would say that statement is extremely offensive to people with autism!

1309986221058334722 2020-09-27 06:40:28 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @RogerGalligan I see your table was compiled by a European group, what of all the other countries not on it, statistics missed often say more than statistics presented!
1309983118477099008 2020-09-27 06:28:08 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @RogerGalligan Or live virus,  that's the connection. Low transmission of live virus leads to low,junk viral DNA also

1309948452999172097 2020-09-27 04:10:23 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @RogerGalligan Just looked at your study. It agrees with me, they have no idea how long the original infection can be detected for. As for the table you refere to, low positives or high positives depends on the amount of revolutions the PCR test is set to put the sample through,no set number!
1309940165117448194 2020-09-27 03:37:27 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> So who 'CAN'T ' believe that china is capable of tricking the world???👇🏼👇🏼😡

1309834821682769920 2020-09-26 20:38:51 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @RogerGalligan Not 2 weeks, several, some virologists saying a few months!!! PCR magnifies everything, the higher the revolutions the more junk that gets taken as a positive .This isn't a discussion its fact, that is how PCR works and why  inventor K Mullis said it shouldn't be used to diagnose
1309765476000595975 2020-09-26 16:03:18 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @RogerGalligan 1/There is only a partial gene sequence used to find covid19,  it has close relatives within the coronavirus family that form a match as per PCR testing.  Also as I say the test does not differentiate between dead and live virus,  hence the high false positives. More tests more +
1309760788467527680 2020-09-26 15:44:40 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @LittleDi70 @SkyNews My mum had a kidney removed , the scar was on her abdomen,  they go in vertically at the front. She is lying.
1309758076380119040 2020-09-26 15:33:54 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @RogerGalligan Wrong. PCR tests pick up old dead inactive RNA aswell as live genetic material,  it can't differentiate between the dead and live virus.  This is why it says on the side of every PCR machine NOT TO BE USED FOR VIRAL DIAGNOSTICS,  as stated by its inventor.

1309604352466747397 2020-09-26 05:23:03 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Iromg My son's school is shut Monday as PHE sent lots of tests in for 16yr old pupils (can consent), and awaits results.  If lots of asymptomatic positives they won't reopen Tuesday.  So PHE is harvesting false positives and shutting schools. Has anyone else reported this?
1309603043340677129 2020-09-26 05:17:51 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> My son's school took instruction from PHE to tests lots of theirs 16yr olds(can give own consent). They now await results,  have shut, will not reopen if lots of asymptomatic positives (immune). So, PHE actively shutting schools!!😡😡

1308882431777398789 2020-09-24 05:34:24 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop Question for you Have you accepted that all covid19 policy is hinged on the results of what is a very dodgy PCR test, the inventor of which stated should never be used to test for infectious viruses due to the high numbers of false positives or would create?
1308788831697735682 2020-09-23 23:22:28 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @BritishAlba @Carol01115190 @LBCNews Rising positives with a very dodgy PCR test mean nothing unless there is a matching surge in deaths that equates to pandemic level
1308778363432177666 2020-09-23 22:40:52 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop Large surges yes. All covid NO!! Countless deaths have been caused by locking down and shutting NHS depts and cancer treatments etc. No doubt many of those deaths were attributed to covid via the dodgy test. It will all come out eventually.
1308777577230852096 2020-09-23 22:37:44 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop I call it a bad winter with a new flu virus on the block. We have had those  peaks before in previous winters in the 50s, 80s and 90s, we didn't destroy ourselves though. Many many thousands will have died not from covid but BECAUSE we have a covid NHS. The figures will come out
1308723672161693696 2020-09-23 19:03:33 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop What don't you understand.  The dodgy test gives the upsurge in positives, the dodgy death certification gives the corresponding surge in deaths.

1308677986007343104 2020-09-23 16:02:00 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop Not made up but reliant on a dodgy test, often misdiagnosis of cause of death (with covid is not of covid, many of the old died of complicated serious health conditions). So yes,  what the WHO is producing as statistics is pretty laughable.
1308515847456124929 2020-09-23 05:17:43 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop No I don't accept it. It can't be proven on the back of a dodgy test and the dying with and of mess.
1308509057112846337 2020-09-23 04:50:44 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop There were more deaths last winter than the average,  but not more than previous winter peaks. As the deaths were both with and of covid19, we can't judge the connection to testing.   We need to separate the of covid19,  many with covid19 deaths would have happened via any virus
1308417798750834689 2020-09-22 22:48:07 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @ajcdeane Is than any coronavirus or covid19,  that's the question?
1308416001005039617 2020-09-22 22:40:58 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop We have no idea what % of positive resulted in sick last winter as we didn't have the mass testing. So far estimates are that current rates of positive results could be up to 90% false positive! No that isn't made up , scientists have used ONS figures to calculate it
1308309539817693185 2020-09-22 15:37:56 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @rustyrockets You are obviously being deliberately patronising in a bid to seem relevant.  Like a child that can't get positive attention  you decide to get ANY attention!
1308308430415900672 2020-09-22 15:33:31 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> If the vast majority of infections and serious illness/death are happening in nursing homes then why isn't the policy &amp; money pumped into stopping this issue? Could it possibly be that the vast majority of those dying in nursing homes were already so ill any virus would be deadly
1308305602414690306 2020-09-22 15:22:17 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop The problem is, the failures of this test are NOT taken into account or even talked about when infection rate and insuing policy is created.
1308305075232595970 2020-09-22 15:20:11 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop Yes I accept that happened last winter. Now I accept there is a surge in infection rate apparent, due to massive testing.

1308103848767164416 2020-09-22 02:00:35 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Brushes1959 @AvonandsomerRob Depends how many revolutions the test goes through, there is no gold standard as it was never intended to be used for an infectious virus. Basically the more revolutions the more likely of a false positive,  picking up of dead RNA cells. Every country is doing it differently!
1308103055083286531 2020-09-22 01:57:26 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop It is useless for testing for any infectious virus.  It was not created to so so and its inventor, kary Mullis,  stated just that!!! It is inadequate for the reasons I stated.
1308070275284692992 2020-09-21 23:47:11 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop What more do you need to see how hopeless the PCR test is!?!
1308069549703561216 2020-09-21 23:44:18 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @AlanGWardrop Asymptomatic positive is almost always an immune person with dead RNA. There is no bar on revolutions of test, the more there are the more asymptomatic positive. Let's stop testing asymptomatic and double test positives. Also 'cases' are not sick people, not even hospitalised.
1308066764241109001 2020-09-21 23:33:13 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Why is it you are accused of being a lockdown moron if you have the intelligence to say the PCR test has too many false positives and can't define between dead and live RNA , these are indisputable facts. I distance, I wash my hands, mask when necessary. Not a moron. Are you?

1307803560227336193 2020-09-21 06:07:21 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Marco55139885 Teachers are saying they are threatened with losing their jobs if they don't promote BLM. It is all pretty sinister.
1307803280379129856 2020-09-21 06:06:14 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @NikkiStix55 It is an international disgrace locking down over such minuscule figures and a very dodgy test with a terrible rate of false positives.

1307791141522337792 2020-09-21 05:18:00 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Prisoner0071 I am dreading this. My heart aches at what needless destruction they are about to unleash

I love Boris's brexit stance, his BBC stance but I can't accept his covid19 policy all based on a well known dodgy PCR test. Something is very badly wrong, not just here but in many other countries.  This is being orchestrated,  like a well rehearsed dance
1307789655295823872 2020-09-21 05:12:06 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @P3llSnow09 @updayUK The NHS is a ghost town. Most departments are restricted,  most referrals are restricted.  Many people will die because of all the other many many things that kill people every day. Even ICUs are nearly empty when in normal circumstances most are at least 3/4 full at any one time

The lie is gathering momentum and I for one am now in genuine fear of where this is all leading to. I am not a conspiracy theorist but I do question what I am being fed when it doesn't match the facts.
1307699477332086784 2020-09-20 23:13:45 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @oflynnsocial @JulieAdmin I am the same. I consider myself open minded in the face of facts. The facts of this virus and the testing are not equating to the actions being taken and considered.

1307697963158966279 2020-09-20 23:07:44 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @JohnD_ohh It certainly isn't about the true statistics relating to the very dodgy pcr test!
1307697319874310146 2020-09-20 23:05:11 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Anyone else who has seen the bias that the police have towards different political protests I ask you this. Are we now living in a police state were the police no longer hold up the law but bend their favour towards political movements,  rather like 1930s Germany?
1307696846618451974 2020-09-20 23:03:18 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @MahyarTousi No police unnecessarily charging at these protesters then? No riot gear? We are fast living in a police state.

1307574982625591296 2020-09-20 14:59:04 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Can anyone tell me why , when we are in a new flu season, covid19 deaths are being added to last season's total? Deaths are counted within the season they happen, so who has decided to sensationalism and misrepresent this season's deaths?

1306962413636521985 2020-09-18 22:24:56 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Why are we even considering a lockdown this early into flu season? We are just pushing infection further into the winter months when the natural flu season is at its worst....is that the plan?????
1306962069087023110 2020-09-18 22:23:34 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @janekin24 I agree. Lockdown now does nothing but delay infection further into winter, anyone would think they are trying to artificially create a winter crisis!

I include May as a remainer,  and Olly Robin's! Leaving the EU could have happened years ago with the genuine will to honour the result!

But do you not think we need  to empower our boys with self confidence as we should our girls. Feeling good about who you are is necessary for both sexes and it madens me how some women think they have the right to belittle men/boys regardless
1304832038214787072 2020-09-13 01:19:35 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Delilahdern @Womankind15 @EveleenWinters You totally misunderstand me. There are bad people out there that do bad things and we all negate risk as much as possible.  I simply believe it is absolutely wrong to condemn a whole gender as bad , it's wrong and ludicrous

1304820932586987520 2020-09-13 00:35:27 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Womankind15 @EveleenWinters You are a very assuming person.  You assume I don't believe men can be violent, yes some men are bad and violent. Some women are bad and violent too. I don't define a whole gender by the actions of a minority. I see different types of danger and abuse in both sexes. I assume zero

I bring my son up to be proud of his sex and not to be oppressed by womens misappropriation of his character based on his gender. He is  decent  and deserves the same respect.

1302686214210945028 2020-09-07 03:12:50 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @DPJHodges @Comp_fixbiz I would assume the positives are low relative to the tested!

1302607165715361792 2020-09-06 21:58:44 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @DavidLammy @mikegove12 @Twitter It is so amusing how you label everyone that disagrees with your politics as far right!
1302606490457473024 2020-09-06 21:56:03 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @ghost_wales He will be eventually labelled as being mentally ill,  it's all so predictable!
1302605914323718151 2020-09-06 21:53:45 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @gravydinner1 It will be another case of mental disorder!!!

1302003245498404870 2020-09-05 05:58:58 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @BraincoralMusic @Teqmock To think they can make this virus disappear,  if they reduce the revolutions of the PCR test!
1302002872486424583 2020-09-05 05:57:29 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @RealDeniseWelch @Cu1pepperTh0mas 80% of positive asymptomatic are now said to be false positive,the other 20% of such low viral load as not to be infectious. The problem is the PCR test is inadequate,  it isn't a binary test. If you want a test to be positive you increase the revolutions, or reduce for negative
1301896497068412928 2020-09-04 22:54:47 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @NewtonPeterCla1 Who would have thought that all we needed was a coronavirus to bring back the brownshirt activities of the 2WW!
1301893867625644034 2020-09-04 22:44:20 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> How are we creating a vaccine for a virus that has not been isolated? A virus for which there is no binary test? A virus which is a coronavirus,  for which there has never been a cure?
1301892352823394306 2020-09-04 22:38:19 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Teqmock @CllrBSilvester This is amazing to read!

1301827064098631682 2020-09-04 18:18:53 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> BLM present themselves as victims and yet white people are pretending to be black  such is the advantage!
1301826562069868544 2020-09-04 18:16:53 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @BornLondoner A whole livelihood on the back of presenting as a victim,  that's the state of race relations these days.
1301648557867499520 2020-09-04 06:29:34 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> It's clear as mud what they are actually testing for now, a con.
1301646349008621569 2020-09-04 06:20:47 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @ValiantThor12 Very interesting.  Thanks for sharing
1301644905299816453 2020-09-04 06:15:03 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @DaisyAdeleleo @Tee_Ess1612 So is he taking in a refugee or an illegal,  this isn't clear , one will no doubt have been checked out and vetted, the other not??
1301635520406138886 2020-09-04 05:37:45 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> People with genuine health reasons for not wearing a mask will be rightfully shocked and worried watching this.
1301634382990643201 2020-09-04 05:33:14 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Isn't this what it's all about, bring down America ....the BLM is a trojan horse

1300915745220632578 2020-09-02 05:57:38 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> Remember according to  virologists,  a virus that does not affect half the people exposed to it is NOT a killer virus 👇🏼
1300913808349835275 2020-09-02 05:49:56 +0800 <RachelBrexit14> @Leigh__York Yes, they can't prove otherwise!  My son has asthma so that will be my line of defense.  We must protect our kids from the ill effects of masks when they do not provide any real defense against a virus that won't even hurt them.
