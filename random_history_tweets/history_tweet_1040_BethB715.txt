They were afraid they would catch a disease from her that she did NOT have.  I saw cowardice as they killed my 13yo. She was ill, but not with covid. FIVE neg tests, including autopsy. #NotMyHeroes

America does NOT approve of this massive bill sending billions, in a time of crisis, to foreign countries. We‚Äôve had enough!  I‚Äôm hurt by these damn draconian covid regulations, but I don‚Äôt need $600.  That pittance won‚Äôt change anything.

Overlooking the propaganda that was permitted into the documentary, it was quite informative. They are in an information bubble that tells them Trump is a rapist, a failure, a criminal. Equally, the documentary says we are in a similar bubble.

Not because Cuomo cancelled it, but because draconian protocols put in place in hospitals during April covid caused my daughter‚Äôs death. She was sick. She didn‚Äôt have covid. She did cough.

The covid test that says you have it or don‚Äôt? Has a 30%-40% ERROR Rate. This is the test that‚Äôs deciding the pandemic is real or not. That‚Äôs what DRs told me before causing my daughter‚Äôs non-covid death.

There are Republican candidates in NY w/clear wins, but they haven‚Äôt been called. Why? What are they hoping will happen? Just spit-balling here... Is someone/entity waiting for a payout &amp; then the vote will switch to blue? ZERO TRUST!

We‚Äôll have to work on a solution for them. Most certainly not their social workers. One was arrested for stealing their votes.  Forget corona. That‚Äôs a non-starter.

NYS is using the corrupt machines, too  We have 4 or 5 republican wins with 100% vote reported and they haven‚Äôt been called. Why?

The young lady pop-quizzed me and asked me my address. Super glad I studied. üòâ  We MUST require that all registered voters are CITIZENS. I cannot become a resident in another country &amp; vote there.

1305923149012369411 2020-09-16 01:35:16 +0800 <BethB715> @bigrigrider @truckinwithnorm I wear one because I like to pick out my own veggies &amp; fruits I don‚Äôt wear it well The first time I wore a similar mask I was out riding an ATV I pull it down constantly.  It is for show and has no purpose  If I believed thisüí©, I‚Äôd invest in respirators &amp; have it fitted like DRs
1305922209303666690 2020-09-16 01:31:32 +0800 <BethB715> @ProTrumpLI @truckinwithnorm How many have died from NOT-COVID?  I know of one very important person. Her Dr‚Äôs waited for her FOURTH Neg COVID before attempting to help her or even enter her room.  I was a witness. She was 13. We‚Äôre in NY. I‚Äôve been told by attys that Cuomo is above the law. I cannot sue.

Cuomo‚Äôs executive order says we can‚Äôt sue for medical ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù during these ‚Äúuncertain‚Äù times.  Also? Are you a struggling med student? Go into pediatrics in NYS. You can suck and Mom &amp; Dad can‚Äôt sue you for killing their child.

If I, for example, do not have the virus (nor fear), I CANNOT transmit the virus to ANYONE.  Take the masks off. If you‚Äôre sick, thank you for putting a mask on, or stay home.

This whole farce killed my 13-yo Down syndrome daughter. She didn‚Äôt have covid, but it definitely killed her!!!!!! Her affordable sweet life mattered. üëºüò¢ü§¨
