It's good that they are acting as if he's under scrutiny. Then they can't act shocked when he throws them out completely!😂
1343761165437063168 2020-12-29 11:30:02 +0800 <Eyconik> @GregReports Exactly. This lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of the ECA and it's correct to do so. The ECA is in direct conflict with the 12th amendment. This is actually helps Pence by showing the public it's contested ahead of time.

1342355687695937536 2020-12-25 14:25:10 +0800 <Eyconik> @qui_mom_jinn They probably filed the case in 2017. I'm sure it's been ongoing.
1342355143749058567 2020-12-25 14:23:00 +0800 <Eyconik> @JessieIsWaiting @Maggieknp I think this was started in 2017. The president is a citizen, Sydney Powell is a citizen. My guess is They filed the lawsuit opened the investigation and then watched as they sealed their own fate. I'm sure that we will have a "sit down" before Congress meets again.

1342326046054559749 2020-12-25 12:27:23 +0800 <Eyconik> @sunnysideAK I don't know. I just read the article and wondered who would have the authority to sue on behalf of the country. Why wouldn't they have told us? With their legal backgrounds. Then I saw the False Claims Act and as soon as I saw KNOWINGLY in bold I knew. Everything just clicked.

1342296620185104386 2020-12-25 10:30:27 +0800 <Eyconik> So let's recap shall we? We are given a hint in the form of a question that directs us to research further. That research leads us to the False Claims Act. Also known as "Lincoln Law"  https://t.co/QNM3vphkdw
1342296606746554370 2020-12-25 10:30:24 +0800 <Eyconik> Fun Fact - It's also called the Qui Tamlaw! 😊  Made to protect Whistleblowers...  https://t.co/QmctOE1NAe
1342296599645532160 2020-12-25 10:30:22 +0800 <Eyconik> Then I see that lawsuits under the False Claims Act are filed under seal. So we wouldn't know if a lawsuit had been filed. Nobody would - not even the defendant.  https://t.co/hIjQ5driu1
1342296595124117510 2020-12-25 10:30:21 +0800 <Eyconik> It's also known as the "Lincoln Law"  How could Trump's legal team not know about this?! Trump loves Lincoln!  https://t.co/h9tIl1eXBX

1342296580745998336 2020-12-25 10:30:18 +0800 <Eyconik> Turns out that any U.S.citizen can file a lawsuit on behalf of the United States Government under the "False Claims Act" as long as they meet two KEY elements. 🔑 outlined below:  https://t.co/8RUzNbABUH
1342296576438509568 2020-12-25 10:30:17 +0800 <Eyconik> This made me wonder who could file a lawsuit on behalf of the entire country. So, I started to research exactly that. This is what I found:  https://t.co/SdH6e6ifMe
1342296572181278726 2020-12-25 10:30:16 +0800 <Eyconik> Unfortunately, it only left us with a suggestion. If we wanted to force SCOTUS to hear the case, the plantiff would need to be the United States collectively, as a whole.  https://t.co/nkhe9FWs0g

1342241322107686912 2020-12-25 06:50:43 +0800 <Eyconik> 💥📢BOOMS📢💥:  The article by The Western Journal (link below) hints that SCOTUS would have to hear a case if it were brought by the United States as a whole.

We are equally convinced of the opposite. That you are the ones who have been fooled. We pity each other. So we aren't that different.
1342224793563770881 2020-12-25 05:45:02 +0800 <Eyconik> @CDSzafraniec @Funkopoplove88 YOU'RE concerned that WE think based on "trends" ?? Are you...the things you say here don't make sense. We use facts almost exclusively. They never let us "trend" -- we are censored. Have you ever considered for one second that we aren't "sad" or "delusional" ?

1342123188537450496 2020-12-24 23:01:18 +0800 <Eyconik> @TheSnydeAbides That's an affirmative on the gaslighting class😂. Nothing I said was untrue. My post is 100% accurate. You read section 6 and make a premature judgement based on rushed research. Own your shit. This is bad form friend. 😘
1342121600594960384 2020-12-24 22:54:59 +0800 <Eyconik> @TheSnydeAbides So is that a yes or no then? On the gaslighting class? Maybe? 😂   Have a good day and a Merry Christmas. I almost had fun here a few times. Debate is healthy. ❤
1342120641508634625 2020-12-24 22:51:10 +0800 <Eyconik> @TheSnydeAbides Read the article. They attempted a challenge on 1/6/ 2016 against Trump electors but couldn't get senate support. I'm saying that there is no clear precedent for the chambers to vote on unlawful electors. So everyone should stop being so absolute about this. It's misleading.
1342119411491233792 2020-12-24 22:46:17 +0800 <Eyconik> @TheSnydeAbides I'm saying that the law is malleable. Because it is. The wording isn't concrete so nobody knows for sure what will happen. I'll let this guy explain it.  https://t.co/SCiiNATXTY
1342118816638267393 2020-12-24 22:43:55 +0800 <Eyconik> @TheSnydeAbides I didn't have the point here. You did. You accused me of not reading something I posted. You were wrong. Ever since you've been basically engaged in a pissing contest with yourself. Hope that clears it up for you.
1342117675795963905 2020-12-24 22:39:23 +0800 <Eyconik> @TheSnydeAbides You just quoted a movie in an attempt to make me look like an idiot while completely ignoring my context. Now I'm the asshole? Do they make all Democrats take a gaslighting class? Like as a prerequisite? Or is it learned behavior? Just curious.
1342116270876065792 2020-12-24 22:33:48 +0800 <Eyconik> @TheSnydeAbides My bad, I assumed it wasn't necessary to clairify that I was talking about the chambers  vote to challenge. I'll try to slow down so you can keep up.
1342114353882013696 2020-12-24 22:26:11 +0800 <Eyconik> @TheSnydeAbides No I was researching what you said, before responding out of haste. I am surprised that as an attorney you don't seem familiar with the lack of precedent here. And how open this leaves the possibility of interpretation. And what it would take to change it once its done.

1342112147321614336 2020-12-24 22:17:25 +0800 <Eyconik> @TheSnydeAbides If the text references section 6 then it is clearly not section 6 in the picture. It wouldn't reference itself. So your game of semantics still makes no sense. In the bigger picture this law is meaningless. The 12th supercedes. This is not our path. It's yours. 😂
1342107038923579393 2020-12-24 21:57:07 +0800 <Eyconik> @TheSnydeAbides Would you? Because my post never mentions section 6.   I disagree with your interpretation. So unless you can tell me where you got your law degree...✌💅
1342105218939547648 2020-12-24 21:49:53 +0800 <Eyconik> @TheSnydeAbides This is cute. Title 3 U.S. contains 21 sections regarding electors. I am referring to section 15. But yes, you're right, it's not in section 6. Maybe you should try reading the Whole thing. Confirmation bias is real. 😂

To prove negligence you need 4 things: Duty, breach, causation and harm. Congress does have the duty. BUT there has been no breach unless the Jan 6th. challenge fails.

1342062128254115846 2020-12-24 18:58:40 +0800 <Eyconik> 🚨Patriots🚨   Title 3 US Code says: Electors that were REGULARLY and LAWFULLY given require approval by both houses to be rejected.   FACT: These states cut corners to ILLEGALLY pass NEW election rules.   New = opposite of regular Illegal = opposite of lawfully  🐸🇺🇸NCSWIC🇺🇸🐸  https://t.co/8MRD2ijuIy
1342056476676919297 2020-12-24 18:36:12 +0800 <Eyconik> @theg0t These electors were not lawfully or regularly given. Since we know that the states broke many of their own laws as well as federal law to allow brand new voting rules. Illegal and new. Opposite of LAWFULLY and Regular. Get it?
1342055703356338179 2020-12-24 18:33:08 +0800 <Eyconik> @theg0t Only LAWFULLY CERTIFIED electors require a vote IF you think that US code overrides the Constitution. Which it doesn't. 🐸  https://t.co/iQdwjQ9LSg

1341993809031393280 2020-12-24 14:27:11 +0800 <Eyconik> @Jeff_on_HS @LLinWood Then you haven't been paying attention. Jan 6th has ALWAYS BEEN THE PLAN. That is the day the costitution gives us to challenge an election. Anything else is just...extra. You should look at my pinned thread. Don't lose hope. This is what separates the real riders. Be a rider. 🇺🇸
1341990727132327936 2020-12-24 14:14:56 +0800 <Eyconik> 🚨Patriots🚨: I see nothing that indicates a 12-23 deadline for Pence. The STATES have until the end of the day on the 23rd, so midnight?!

1341894475858251777 2020-12-24 07:52:28 +0800 <Eyconik> @WillyBorNot Exactly. Which is why asking them to send Trump electors is a waste of time. They won't.

1341892399111557126 2020-12-24 07:44:13 +0800 <Eyconik> @r_tpm @PepeMatter Yes sir!
1341842645715398658 2020-12-24 04:26:31 +0800 <Eyconik> @r_tpm @PepeMatter Yes! Praying Medic is ridiculously smart and researches extensively. I actually retweeted this thread earlier and I follow Ivan Raiklin. We have to be careful relying on specific dates. Jan 6th has always been the target in my opinion. Anything else is just a bonus.
1341834779197628416 2020-12-24 03:55:16 +0800 <Eyconik> @FRUMPLEMEIST If he allows it to go through on the 6th, yes. Today would be asking them to self correct. Which could be helpful if they do it. But hurtful of they don't because it would delay other avenues. So it really comes down to if we think they would actually self correct.
1341831531791347714 2020-12-24 03:42:21 +0800 <Eyconik> Can't forget the sauce:   https://t.co/Bmm1aWf8ik
1341831349032902664 2020-12-24 03:41:38 +0800 <Eyconik> What we know for sure:  *Legislature has the power here  *Pence presides over the legislature during the electoral count.   So if the Pence card is played today or on Jan 6th. - I like our chances @PepeMatter  Till then:  🇺🇸Patriots will Hold the Line!🇺🇸
1341831347883618310 2020-12-24 03:41:38 +0800 <Eyconik> Jan. 6th is like a legal black hole. Nobody has seen anything like this before. There is no clear legal precedent other than that of SCOTUS definitively giving the state legislatures the power. So the law is open to be interpreted by the State/Federal Legislatures.
1341831346654724099 2020-12-24 03:41:37 +0800 <Eyconik> Right now Dems have no avenue of defense. By their own admission, everything is fine and Trump has no chance.   I'm not saying Pence shouldn't send the request. I'm saying that if he doesn't - the criminal investigations have a better chance producing results. So don't panic.
1341831345417441281 2020-12-24 03:41:37 +0800 <Eyconik> Giving the states another chance to remedy could halt that process. It's risky.   2. It also gives the Dems more time to act in defense. If they know Pence plans to reject the electors ahead of Jan 6th that is more time to come up with a plan to stop him.
1341831344335298560 2020-12-24 03:41:37 +0800 <Eyconik> If you watch Praying Medic's podcast from 12/21/20 - Ivan Raiklin outlines the "certification" of the crime on Dec 14th and the evidence we've seen since then himself. People talk when jail time becomes real. "Well I was just following orders" ... Really? Who gave them? Etc.
1341831343186063364 2020-12-24 03:41:36 +0800 <Eyconik> I believe this is why Trump and Sidney Powell warned the states excessively against certification. They were trying to warn them that it takes away their power to remedy, thus becoming a crime. It's also why we're seeing more evidence after Dec.14th. Including criminal charges.
1341831342028435463 2020-12-24 03:41:36 +0800 <Eyconik> It's only beneficial if we believe there is a good chance the states would truly correct their wrongs. Otherwise our best option may be to move forward with the investigation of the crimes that were officially committed when the states certified fraudulent electors on Dec.14th.
1341831340694646784 2020-12-24 03:41:36 +0800 <Eyconik> If we give them the chance to correct the crime we could stall our investigation. It's like having to wait for a shoplifter to leave the store before they have actually committed a crime. If they still have a chance to pay, no crime has occurred.
1341831339587346434 2020-12-24 03:41:36 +0800 <Eyconik> 1. When the states certified fraudulent electors on Dec. 14th, they also officially certified a crime. A Pence challenge today gives the states the option of "remedying" the situation again. This could stop ongoing criminal investigations.

Just remember that it may not be the best strategy depending on the GAME plan.   If he does object today it sends a strong message BUT it does two things that could hurt us:  Read the full thread!

And then if they don't like it - they can appeal. And prove there WASN'T fraud. Which, can't be done. Because there was.

1341064473134706693 2020-12-22 00:54:20 +0800 <Eyconik> 3/3: Even if SCOTUS ruled majority wasn't technically met - The House and Senate then immediately vote for President - Trump still wins.   🐢 vs 🐇  Jan. 6th = UNSEALING     "The FACE of a watch/clock has multiple versions"  My pinned thread explains more.
1341064471352111104 2020-12-22 00:54:20 +0800 <Eyconik> 2/3: With no legal precedent, the law is open to interpretation. That turns the tables doesn't it? Now who has the burden of proof? Now who needs the evidence. Now who needs standing? SCOTUS has been very clear that this power belongs to the legislature.
1341064469133340676 2020-12-22 00:54:19 +0800 <Eyconik> 1/3: What if the President of the Senate (Pence), exercises his constitutional power/duty and simply throws out the electors from the fraudulent states all together? No meeting, no vote - Giving Trump the majority and declares him the winner? Who could challenge that? SCOTUS?

He can throw them out and declare Trump the winner and then what? SCOTUS? NOPE they already gave the state legislatures the power.

1340894188112637954 2020-12-21 13:37:41 +0800 <Eyconik> @tmword They've done citizens, electors, states, the Trump - no court wants to touch it.
1340878832560168960 2020-12-21 12:36:40 +0800 <Eyconik> @AnbezeduA @eosionemesis If it even comes to a vote. Because if these states get thrown out then Trump technically has the majority. But like he said and the first link in the thread explains, the house gets a vote per state and Trump has that majority too. 26-22 ish

1339582547752325120 2020-12-17 22:45:42 +0800 <Eyconik> @55true4u I want to see what's under the surface.

1339579546333552640 2020-12-17 22:33:46 +0800 <Eyconik> @KPark212 I rtd both.
1339578409853325312 2020-12-17 22:29:15 +0800 <Eyconik> @Maggieknp @realDonaldTrump I mean it's bigger than our emotions. We can't let emotions override strategy. Harness that energy and use it to gain support. We can help people wake up and be patient with them or we can feed the narrative that Trump supporters are irrational and violent. I choose the former.
1339575750710718465 2020-12-17 22:18:41 +0800 <Eyconik> @KPark212 That graphic with the grim is chilling 👀
1339574055603736577 2020-12-17 22:11:57 +0800 <Eyconik> @Maggieknp @realDonaldTrump Maybe, maybe not, but we are here to inform and to grow. I see new people everywhere. If they see "Military is the only way!" they aren't going to understand.   It's not the only way, yet. I know you're fed up, we all are, but it's not about us. Let's meet people where they are.
1339566593647493120 2020-12-17 21:42:18 +0800 <Eyconik> This plan has clearly been the narrative of primary focus since Dec.14th - This was posted Dec.13th.   Lawyers - this post is not for you. You don't need me to explain the law to you. See link 1.  This thread is for people who need hope not a legal technicalities lecture.
1339565987000147968 2020-12-17 21:39:53 +0800 <Eyconik> To the nitpickers - I understand this is an oversimplification. This thread is for people who didn't realize Congress was always the plan. It is a viable path and it's worded so people can understand. Interpretation and precedent wording would have defeated the purpose.
1339558056980574209 2020-12-17 21:08:23 +0800 <Eyconik> They are now telling us that Biden is our next president - he's not!   They say that they can't prove fraud - I believe they can.  If you don't - if you're saying things like "I'm tired of all the talk"  You haven't been paying attention.   Have Faith  Hold the F*****g Line! 🇺🇸
1339558054665351171 2020-12-17 21:08:22 +0800 <Eyconik> They said the success of the economy was fragile - It wasn't.   They said Covid would decimate our economy - It didn't.  They said he couldn't get a vaccine by the end of the year - It's here.   They said the Hunter Biden story was "Russian Misinformation" - it wasn't.
1339558051737702401 2020-12-17 21:08:21 +0800 <Eyconik> They said he'd never win the 2016 election - he did  They said he'd never build the wall - it stands.   They said "it wasn't that easy" to recognize Jerusalem as the true capital of Israel - it was.   They said his meetings with North Korea would start a war - they didn't
1339449872748060678 2020-12-17 13:58:30 +0800 <Eyconik> @thechunkybaxter @DonkeySlobber1 @MutantGenepool @nca8190 Ok. Then you have nothing to worry about. So why are you here, reading Trump threads? Either you're just an ass who likes to make fun of people you believe mentally ill (careful or you'll have to cancel yourself) or you can tell there's truth here and your curious. I was too.
1339447024882749440 2020-12-17 13:47:11 +0800 <Eyconik> @thechunkybaxter @DonkeySlobber1 @MutantGenepool @nca8190 I've said it once and I'll continue to say it. This isn't our battle. We have two completely different perceptions of reality. And whatever the reason, the people are not the problem.

1339039441478934530 2020-12-16 10:47:35 +0800 <Eyconik> @pwrussell I would care, if you didn't just insult my intelligence by linking a Huffington Post article. How about you read the 12th amendment first, post a link to that and tell me your interpretation of it. Then we can talk. Until then go back to the kiddie table.
1339026415849775104 2020-12-16 09:55:50 +0800 <Eyconik> @westmorelandwit No, a challenge is settled by house vote. Check out the 12th amendment.

1338825632344633348 2020-12-15 20:37:59 +0800 <Eyconik> @DaileyReona His only tie breaker would be for the VP so he'd have to fook himself. Isn't it beautiful?
1338825135999119360 2020-12-15 20:36:01 +0800 <Eyconik> Let's gently remind Congress that we vote by show of loyalty not by party. Maybe we can get a bipartisan overturn.

1338818072753426432 2020-12-15 20:07:57 +0800 <Eyconik> @DaileyReona He only accepts the challenge - majority STATE vote in house determines Potus and majority vote in Senate determines VP! Vote Georgia! We need those Senate seats! We are currently tied. If we get only 1 of the 2 open seats Pence is tie breaker! If we lose both...it gets ugly.

1338359331423744000 2020-12-14 13:45:04 +0800 <Eyconik> There are several questions about EO13848 as well as the Insurrection act and how that ties in here. I have my theories, but I don't know enough to do anything but speculate. However I have some articles that I will link below.
1338355273132601344 2020-12-14 13:28:57 +0800 <Eyconik> @dgoinsrn @PrivatizeIt @illdiscourse Well we are still technically at war since 9/11. There is already EO (13848) and Covid has cause a state of emergency as well. I don't know what limits if any are put on military tribunal. I have a couple good articles I will add to the thread on this.
1338354262305366018 2020-12-14 13:24:56 +0800 <Eyconik> @PrivatizeIt @illdiscourse If the support is there to challenge all Pence has to do is allow it. He doesn't have to initiate it. The bigger threat is Pelsoi refusing to meet on the 6th and there is some situation where she would be president as the Speaker of the House. It's in link 1 toward the end.

1338339583411560448 2020-12-14 12:26:36 +0800 <Eyconik> @KsalmonB @DavidBCollum Civil war would be an option either way. States are threatening to Sucede. When Antifa riots -which they will- that only gives Trump a clear opening to use counterinsurgency operations and activate military tribunals. He's used all of their moves against them. It's brilliant.

1338325352666570753 2020-12-14 11:30:03 +0800 <Eyconik> @Nflguy2018 Not exactly how it happens. If there is a challenge from at least 1 member of the senate and 1 member of the house the VP can choose to accept the challenge - which would then go the house (1 vote per state) and majority vote would win.
1338323640220327939 2020-12-14 11:23:15 +0800 <Eyconik> @bioforcegenome @sonmanvb Correct. But the January 6th date is of "ultimate significance"  https://t.co/lKp7yPXgsW
1338321246010880000 2020-12-14 11:13:44 +0800 <Eyconik> @Redrams10 It is viable and not a long shot by any means. I'd say it has a better chance of working than not.

1338307125123182593 2020-12-14 10:17:37 +0800 <Eyconik> @bioforcegenome @sonmanvb I certainly hope so. It has to happen by Jan 6th.
1338305938609070080 2020-12-14 10:12:54 +0800 <Eyconik> @JMDA_1 Maybe he will. Maybe this is plan B. In just know it's viable and people need hope right now. Tomorrow is a big day.
1338304358476288001 2020-12-14 10:06:38 +0800 <Eyconik> @KnightChevylamp I think they are in action. I think they will deliver irrefutable evidence that we need - maybe even enough to put enough pressure on the dems for a bipartisan vote. It's hard to know. But I do know that this is viable and in no way a long shot.

It seems very unlikely with this momentum that it would fail even now. Plus you know he is saving the best for last. Never show your hand. This may even be a backup. Biden could concede. But this is definitely viable.
1338300063777427458 2020-12-14 09:49:34 +0800 <Eyconik> @bioforcegenome @sonmanvb He can't bring down the system if Biden transitions. He needs executive power.
1338299217920602115 2020-12-14 09:46:12 +0800 <Eyconik> @ncutinello @TraciAnnCooper2 But I couldn't get all the way into it or I'd still be writing. If you look at link 2 it says that Biden rejected the challenges in 2016 ironically saying, "It's Over" 😂 Now we know where that came from.
1338298772946817026 2020-12-14 09:44:26 +0800 <Eyconik> @ncutinello @TraciAnnCooper2 Yes! That's how I understand it too. 1 from each the house and the senate. I think that Pence can accept or decline the challenges. I also think that if a state sends 2 sets of electors - which I fully expect from Arizona. Pence decides which set to accept. I think.

1338296899393171461 2020-12-14 09:36:59 +0800 <Eyconik> @OVoluntarist I think the EO is plan A for Deep State exposure and military tribunal for sure. But that has to be plan B for the election. He wouldn't want to take it by force. That would be hard to accept. He has to beat them at their own game.
1338296482865229831 2020-12-14 09:35:20 +0800 <Eyconik> @OVoluntarist And by Friday the votes are sealed. The information will further ensure this victory. Trust me there are ways it can get messy. Including the speaker of the house acting as president until a resolution is met. That's a nightmare so the EO is necessary for back it.
1338295846622949377 2020-12-14 09:32:48 +0800 <Eyconik> @OVoluntarist I'm fully aware of it. It's been in place since 2018. But that EO is for other purposes and last resort. It can't overturn the election. This overturns. Even if he proved it all - it doesn't elect him automatically. This does. We do. It has to be legally sound.
1338294957380165636 2020-12-14 09:29:16 +0800 <Eyconik> @AnaxJos Because this their hail mary. Nothing to lose. O
1338294817693048836 2020-12-14 09:28:43 +0800 <Eyconik> @AnaxJos I wondered the same but my guess is they already know. Trump has been saying it since before the election. See link 1. Dems tried it in 2016. That's why the election fraud was so obvious. Obvious enough to make Sydney Powell question if they meant to get caught.

1338274206124007425 2020-12-14 08:06:49 +0800 <Eyconik> @zanudanon No. Pence will choose the winning team. I'm sure there is back up for that regardless.

And with the powers granted by the EO. China would be cut of and big tech is totally wrapped up in Chinas BS. See Title 50 - 18 US Law number 794-ish on this two. I might have a link.

1338263508002217988 2020-12-14 07:24:18 +0800 <Eyconik> @Nettiequeen @SpeechlessMJJ16 Facts. We are also still at war. There is also Title 50, Directive 51, the Insurrection act. Pick one. There are so many ways it's hard to guess but nomatter how it plays out - they have it covered.
1338262944229056513 2020-12-14 07:22:04 +0800 <Eyconik> @BrianA56704722 @SpeechlessMJJ16 He could technically do that at any time.   1. We are still at war technically since 9-11.   2. There are several states of emergency declared.   3. He has several avenues available to him to make this plan foolproof.   I think this is why they were so sloppy. "Nothing to lose"
1338260785215266822 2020-12-14 07:13:29 +0800 <Eyconik> @MEXODOX The way I understand it there must be support from at least one member of each. The House vote determines the President and the Senate vote is for the VP. There are definitely complications that could arise. The article at the bottom outlines it all beautifully.

1338256577879547905 2020-12-14 06:56:46 +0800 <Eyconik> @CarlieBroyles @OctoberKnight21 Doesn't matter. So are half the Republicans but if they ever want to win another election they have no choice. The compromised know to chose the winning team. That's what they do.
1338255948134100992 2020-12-14 06:54:16 +0800 <Eyconik> @spikesterr2 @PepeMatter I think so too. This will provide undeniable support from the house and the people at just the right moment. Among other things, the EO allowed all the proof to be collected and exposed ahead of time, likely to ensure support. The courts wouldn't be quick enough.
1338253212592316416 2020-12-14 06:43:24 +0800 <Eyconik> @DecaoBear @cjtruth Enjoy the "show" set the "stage" -- The Art of War. Feign weakness. It's all strategy - long game - misdirection.

1338252092193038339 2020-12-14 06:38:56 +0800 <Eyconik> @WBlake2019 @cjtruth Which is where I think the backup plan might be military. "Military is the only way - 11.3 VERIFIES first marker" when the votes are verified it would set the first marker either way. Lose or win.
1338242682267824135 2020-12-14 06:01:33 +0800 <Eyconik> @GhostofMori @PepeMatter Military is the only way but I was struggling to figure out how he would have the power to use it if Biden transitioned. I concluded that Military is the only way to expose the truth. The other courts would be caught up in legal bs for decades.
1338239806686580737 2020-12-14 05:50:07 +0800 <Eyconik> @SpeechlessMJJ16 Hence the drop where we are asked why Antifa is allowed to exist.
1338239634116124674 2020-12-14 05:49:26 +0800 <Eyconik> @SpeechlessMJJ16 My guess is that when this challenge results in an overturn it will cause riots lead by Antifa and MS13. In which case Trump will declare Martial Law and use the military courts to expose the Deep State.

1338229941599674372 2020-12-14 05:10:55 +0800 <Eyconik> Edit to #9 - The 2016 challenge did not go to vote due to lack of support from the Senate. The challenge was rejected before the vote took place.

1338228290419650563 2020-12-14 05:04:22 +0800 <Eyconik> 10. Checkmate - Sauce in form of links to follow: Link 1 was written by a Harvard Government Professor who figured this out way before me (make sure to click full article to see where Trump himself outlined this plan months ago) Link 2 outlines the Dem challenge on Jan 6th 2016.
1338228288293122053 2020-12-14 05:04:21 +0800 <Eyconik> 9. The Democracy Hypocrisy - Dems and MSM will call Trumps actions unprecedented, claiming irrevocable damage to our Democracy. Except - Biden honored the EXACT same challenge attempted by Democrats in 2016. In which the house majority voted in favor of Trump.
1338228286955139081 2020-12-14 05:04:21 +0800 <Eyconik> 8. The Appeal - Democrats will panic and immediately appeal this decision to SCOTUS. But SCOTUS having set a very clear legal precedent that the power lies with the state legislatures - will again - dismiss the case on standing.
1338228284509851650 2020-12-14 05:04:20 +0800 <Eyconik> 7. The Second Vote - As directed by the US Federal constitution - a challenged election is settled by a simple majority house vote by ballot. However, the house gets one vote per state not per representative - Giving Trump the Republican majority 26-23 (or 22). Winner takes all.
1338228283188670470 2020-12-14 05:04:20 +0800 <Eyconik> 6. The Election Rejection - On January 6th Congress will convene to count the electoral votes. At this time the sitting VP, Mike Pence, has the ability to challenge by refusing to accept the votes from states in which he believes the vote was compromised. Which - he will do.
1338228281548697600 2020-12-14 05:04:20 +0800 <Eyconik> 5. The Clout - The calls matter! Why? Republicans know that Trump is the way to the Republican voters' hearts. When the media tried to shame Trump for overshadowing the senators in the GA rally - they basically provided incentive for every Republican to have Trumps back instead.
1338228273231384583 2020-12-14 05:04:18 +0800 <Eyconik> 4. The Fire 🔥 - MSM and the trolls continue to assist in Trump's path to victory. They only fuel the🔥 when they ignore or antagonize Republicans. Why is that a good thing? Every pissed off Republican is another call to Congress reps and senators demanding action.
1338228267246120962 2020-12-14 05:04:16 +0800 <Eyconik> 3. The Reason - The various court filings were never meant to prevail. Their only purpose was to inform the pubic. It allowed people see the fraud. The actual filing docs allowed Anons to read and share so that people could see the problems with our elections.
1338228265224466434 2020-12-14 05:04:16 +0800 <Eyconik> 2. The BIG one - The Texas SCOTUS filing - This case was 50/50 on standing but it wouldn't have offered relief. The Justices Trump appointed had no issue dismissing the case and deferring power back to the state legislatures. The reason will become clear in just a moment.
1338228263517368321 2020-12-14 05:04:15 +0800 <Eyconik> 1. The Stage - The legal effort - Make no mistake that Sydney Powell, Rudy Giuliani, Lin Wood, Ted Cruz and the Texas AG are quite familiar with standing. They knew they had little to no chance of the cases being heard, and even less chance of favorable relief.
1338228261483110403 2020-12-14 05:04:15 +0800 <Eyconik> 💥Big Boom💥: This makes it all make sense! Read this entire thread! Sauce linked at the end.   🇺🇸 This is how Trump wins! 🇺🇸

They have already set that precedent. Maybe it's strategic. Like chess. Just saying.

Maybe, This legal effort could just be an attempt to inform the public. So they get mad and pressure congress and he wins with a 26-23 vote on the 6th?

You apply one of a handful of proven test statistics to a data set - this allows you to determine the probability of a null hypothesis (event or theory that is assumed to be true) using the critical values or comparing the alpha.

1335694182913073154 2020-12-07 05:14:43 +0800 <Eyconik> @JuliansRum I am admittedly very new. But maybe that works to my advantage because I am learning everything at once. But I'm just going to throw it out there that in my opinion. Qs posts are in large part upside down (much like the world right now). They should be read backwards.

1335439651184762881 2020-12-06 12:23:18 +0800 <Eyconik> @AOC No. They'd be unemployed because Dems shut down their establishments.

Like Col. Phil Waldron the cybersecurity expert who testified at several of the hearings? Or like Matt Braynard from the election integrity fund who also testified several times on the clear evidence of fraud?

You are blind people not bad people. You think you're doing the right thing. I pray you start to think free.

They are all 3 or more hours long. Full of evidence. Including expert witness testimony from US military officials and the election integrity fund. Watch them.

1335296377128169477 2020-12-06 02:53:59 +0800 <Eyconik> @h0n0rb0und @MajorPatriot Yes. He qualified himself before each testimony. This is why I am here. I am late to this particular community but I have always been awake, just alone. Wish I'd known sooner. I avoided all social media and news out of disgust and in doing so I missed the Patriots. 🇺🇸
1335286647655702536 2020-12-06 02:15:19 +0800 <Eyconik> @a_snickers77 I am so sorry. I brand new and I don't know what this means.
1335274618937028608 2020-12-06 01:27:32 +0800 <Eyconik> @MajorPatriot Same guy talks about white hat hackers and Frankfurt in Arizona hearing I believe.
