1335211462189604870 2020-12-05 21:16:34 +0800 <iabfe> @cobbah_ Not saying all old people are intelligent, good or don’t make errors. However, those that survive the rigours of getting a little older, with some semblance of this virtues intact are worth listening to. As are those who are young, good at heart, and can articulate their ideas.
1335210692463513601 2020-12-05 21:13:30 +0800 <iabfe> @cobbah_ You want people to listen a a spoilt child does once born. What do they know of Men &amp; wars. So naive.. One day I hope you grow up and learn just to respect good people..

1304330287984377857 2020-09-11 16:05:48 +0800 <iabfe> @Detracter Obviously Kevin you do not go to deep. This is a National Australia type person against someone pushing irrelevant Globalist Communist policy. I know whos side I’m on. Australia all day long.. Nats need to bring certain Leftie liberals to heal..

1304326759937179654 2020-09-11 15:51:47 +0800 <iabfe> @rowandean @ellymelly Always was. If you followed my post since the beginning of Covid19.. There was never a logical or ethical reason why the medical establishment, bureaucrats &amp; politicians demonised Hydroxychloroquine..

1303972950719299584 2020-09-10 16:25:52 +0800 <iabfe> @roymorganonline On seeing the above tweet from Roy, I move that all other States permanently close their borders to all Victorians &amp; send all those outside Victoria back along with their Pansie Grand final.. When I say close, I mean no chance of any exemptions &amp; all who violate get 5 years jail.  https://t.co/6W2cHlaLp2

1303610843205185536 2020-09-09 16:26:59 +0800 <iabfe> @Paramythia__ Because a Majority of you were stupid enough to vote for Daniel Anderson twice.

1301796684482129920 2020-09-04 16:18:10 +0800 <iabfe> @catedempsey I can think of a few reasons not Covid19 related.. Thinking overpaid incompetent Leftie bureaucrats, but I’m not sure Pallachook would see it the same way..
1301678862947037184 2020-09-04 08:29:59 +0800 <iabfe> @ScottPresler Great to hear you are ok Scott. Need you to keep up the good work.. Just a thought... Was the other vehicle driven by someone named Hillary?

1301157796772220929 2020-09-02 21:59:27 +0800 <iabfe> @andrewtillett Yeh, but if you are 50, 000 people protesting to allow illegals to stay it is ok. Yeh, got it.. imbeciles. Time to start locking up bureaucrats &amp; police for enforcing directions from their political masters that are not infact law. Employing a lot of imbeciles in law enforcement.
1301156506314956801 2020-09-02 21:54:20 +0800 <iabfe> @9NewsMelb @LanaMurphy Time to lock up some police..

1301154263423385601 2020-09-02 21:45:25 +0800 <iabfe> @CllrBSilvester Stop talking shit Brian. Hypothetically vaccine against known cure Hydroxychloroquine, yet they go for Gdańsk first.. Just letting people did unnecessarily.. Jail need to be considered..
1301152613862383616 2020-09-02 21:38:52 +0800 <iabfe> @StevenCiobo So Steven what do you agree with? In this clip you saw police breaking the law. Telling lies &amp; intimidating an innocent person.. Get some balls &amp; stand with your community..
1301152155332677633 2020-09-02 21:37:02 +0800 <iabfe> @KeiraSavage00 Police are the law breakers. Lock them up. Jail is go good..
1301151918824329217 2020-09-02 21:36:06 +0800 <iabfe> @OMGTheMess @VictoriaPolice I’m sure if they are put in jail for breaking or inventing law, they will feel very embarrassed.
1301151668948566017 2020-09-02 21:35:06 +0800 <iabfe> @GemmaTognini So right Gemma. It is not that those from the AFL or Jeanette Young’s millionaire mates have the virus. It’s that they let these people flaunt their own regulations, but allow  others not rich to be infected, die &amp; not even have their uninflected love one present. Manslaughter.
1301149956636639235 2020-09-02 21:28:18 +0800 <iabfe> @NikkiStix55 Onley if they are funny. Troub7is The Lefties have banned al, the right wing comedians, so hard to make a judgment..
1301149094992318464 2020-09-02 21:24:53 +0800 <iabfe> @eileeniorio Gees Eileen, you do look too intelligent to be falling for this Q joke. Just post as you feel, you are too smart to think your ideas come from or need validation some irrelevant grub..
1301147395691077632 2020-09-02 21:18:07 +0800 <iabfe> @DrewPavlou Yeh, drew but this is where you could loose us. Are you asking for him to become a citizen or are you saying you just support his right to stay for a while?  In these times no one is to be considered innocent if not a citizen, as citizens are being locked down in their lives.
1301145944298344449 2020-09-02 21:12:21 +0800 <iabfe> @NatalieElphicke Just stop them all. Big or small all must be stopped &amp; sent back. Not that hard..

1301143565146431488 2020-09-02 21:02:54 +0800 <iabfe> @sanaayesha___ Never had a real relationship, as always found those I attract were shallow. Some times women form relationships when they are not realy there.. They actually think the deeply loved someone, but that is not reciprocated.. Not excusing arseholes, but this is true..
1301142629757976577 2020-09-02 20:59:11 +0800 <iabfe> @catedempsey Law enforcement officials break the law? How do we the peoooe hold them to account? Time we the people start electing people who will lock up those law enforcement officials who break or invent law such as judges &amp; police.
1301141490748608512 2020-09-02 20:54:40 +0800 <iabfe> @Newwayofdoing @andrewsmithinoz Actually I think you will find the police in this clip are breaking the law. This is the question we all need to start asking, when judges &amp; law enforcement officials start breaking or inventing law how do we bring to account &amp; if appropriate put them in jail..
1301067163688742912 2020-09-02 15:59:19 +0800 <iabfe> @andrewsmithinoz This must be the end of this. These police are breaking the law. Time to hold the bureaucrats to account &amp; lock a lot up..
