That White British birthrates are not below replacement levels, or that such fertility rates would will somehow magically not result in us becoming an ethnic minority in the UK?

1340918755531042816 2020-12-21 15:15:19 +0800 <WestHullensian> The lesson of #BrexitIsland is that we should be more self-sufficient, not more subservient. That Macron and the French would cause chaos on the border in service to his political ambitions is proof that these are not people we want to be in a political union with.

If you deny the existence of indigenous Britons then you deny the existence of all native peoples.

1338617885992882182 2020-12-15 06:52:28 +0800 <WestHullensian> @SpookLana @NXNStreams @Nature_and_Race All ethnic groups committed genocide. Not all of them built some of the most pathologically tolerant and accepting nations of Earth though. We've taken altruism to the point of ethnomasochism, and it has to end.
1338617378528178186 2020-12-15 06:50:28 +0800 <WestHullensian> @MarkEng81412342 @TheMendozaWoman What's racist about acknowledging the fact that if nothing is done, White Britons will be an ethnic minority in the UK by 2066?
1338567917672271883 2020-12-15 03:33:55 +0800 <WestHullensian> @Mammothfoot @Jack88904631 @NadiaWhittomeMP Because a system that eradicates an indigenous population for the sake of global capital is a crime against humanity, no matter how passive or 'tolerant' it might appear at first glance.

1338566891724558338 2020-12-15 03:29:51 +0800 <WestHullensian> @NadiaWhittomeMP If population A has birthrates below replacement levels and population B has birthrates above replacement levels, then population B will replace population A.

1338561869376786435 2020-12-15 03:09:53 +0800 <WestHullensian> I'm always suspicious of people who use the term "White genocide" instead of Great Replacement. They know it's awful optics that makes us look like simpletons, but they persist with it anyway.  Why?
1338560144687370240 2020-12-15 03:03:02 +0800 <WestHullensian> @thicktank @Nature_and_Race Why is it important that your family controls their home and possessions, and not strangers?
1338559674577281025 2020-12-15 03:01:10 +0800 <WestHullensian> @HintysVoice @Nature_and_Race Why do you apply criteria to Britons that you would not apply to Native Americans or Maori?  There's no such thing as "pure blood". There are distinct ethnic groups however, and the English, Scots, Welsh and Irish are among them.
1338559115724017666 2020-12-15 02:58:57 +0800 <WestHullensian> @NXNStreams @Nature_and_Race There is no demographic in recorded human history that has treated minorities better than Whites have, so if you think minorities are treated poorly, wait until you become one.
1338558799356039169 2020-12-15 02:57:41 +0800 <WestHullensian> @OlliePentecost @Nature_and_Race I would make that trade, no problem.

1338524863670194181 2020-12-15 00:42:50 +0800 <WestHullensian> @PeakyOswald That's not the point.   Politics is about perception, not truth. Who cares what Kier wants?  She forced him into a position where his two options were either a) leave Ethnonationalist talks points unchallenged or b) attack Israel.  It was perfect.
1338524428284653569 2020-12-15 00:41:06 +0800 <WestHullensian> @jdpoulter Conspiracy theories that the Independent and Guardian report as fact?  How exactly do White Britons avoid becoming a minority when birthrates are below replacement levels?   Perhaps we should we add mathematics to the list of racist disciplines...
1338523962058416128 2020-12-15 00:39:15 +0800 <WestHullensian> @jdpoulter She's great.  Starmer didn't know what to do.
1338523564975198210 2020-12-15 00:37:41 +0800 <WestHullensian> @PeakyOswald I think you're misreading the situation.  She brought up Israel to force him to make a choice. He could either leave her assertions to about the rights of indigenous Britons unchallenged, or he could attack them, and attack Israel by proxy.
1338523123814182915 2020-12-15 00:35:55 +0800 <WestHullensian> @BorisLiesRants @Independent There should be no restrictions at all.

I'm the one arguing against tying the deeds of a political faction to their entire ideology.   Are you? Because it's time to stop obsessing over the "far right" due to the actions of Hitler's National Socialist if so.
1338519898864148485 2020-12-15 00:23:07 +0800 <WestHullensian> @TheMendozaWoman I don't understand why the Left keeps calling it a conspiracy theory. It's based on projections from the head of demography at Oxford. White British birthrates are below replacement levels. How could it possibly NOT be happening?
1338517099157868549 2020-12-15 00:11:59 +0800 <WestHullensian> @SWso155 @AyoCaesar There is no historical precedent for an ethnic group going from majority to minority status and that not resulting in oppression or slavery or worse.
1338516908765818886 2020-12-15 00:11:14 +0800 <WestHullensian> @AzevedoAudio @SWso155 @AyoCaesar If people are just people and preserving ethnic groups is arbitrary, then why does the left take the actions of Hitler's National Socialists so much more seriously than those of Stalin or Mao? How can Ash openly identify as a Communist?
1338514169654632449 2020-12-15 00:00:21 +0800 <WestHullensian> The Great Replacement wasn't a conspiracy theory when the Guardian and the Independent reported that indigenous Britons would be an ethnic minority in Britain by 2066, so why is it now? Because the banks don't like it? Remember that 1% thingy...
1338270796960174081 2020-12-14 07:53:16 +0800 <WestHullensian> @jeremycorbyn Corbyn wants indigenous Britons to become an ethnic minority in our own country.

1338083216637517829 2020-12-13 19:27:53 +0800 <WestHullensian> @voice_wales Why would any indigenous population anywhere in the world want to become an ethnic minority in their own lands?  The reason the politicians never ask the people if they want it is because they know what the answer will be.

1337441284156518401 2020-12-12 00:57:05 +0800 <WestHullensian> @BBCNews You mean like how peoples who have evolved to live in equatorial climates are more susceptible to seasonal winter viruses?

That's why we need our own institutions. Grandma Towler's Tea to start, and our own bank the eventual dream.

They didn't even have any pregnant women in any of their trials, and the data from the pregnant animal testing still hasn't been analysed.  If you're under 60 and healthy you'd be insane to take it.

1335286396572098561 2020-12-06 02:14:20 +0800 <WestHullensian> @BBCSport The BBC is duty bound to be politically impartial.  "Overshadowed" is not the appropriate language to be using.

I have little time for either personally, I'm just trying to articulate why normies would boo.

1335283810632675329 2020-12-06 02:04:03 +0800 <WestHullensian> It's perfectly healthy and normal for Whites to be pro-White.  If the media, state and financial institutions call that racism then so be it.   It's just a word.

Of course they're woke.

1327273688891338754 2020-11-13 23:34:41 +0800 <WestHullensian> @talkRADIO British law quite explicitly prohibits free speech. It's not under attack, because we've never had it.

1327204894562979846 2020-11-13 19:01:19 +0800 <WestHullensian> @SteStringfellow @shieldsgazette @PatAlternative What the leaflets lack, and what I think they really need to drive home, is that British birthrates are below replacement levels, and that it's not just that we'll become a smaller proportion of the population, but we'll eventually disappear altogether.
1327204185415290880 2020-11-13 18:58:30 +0800 <WestHullensian> @shieldsgazette A political activist group delivering leaflets is not criminal activity, but wasting police time is.

Instead she hopes that making vague claims of "racism" will be sufficient to keep your minds closed - looks like it worked.

1326168117551243266 2020-11-10 22:21:32 +0800 <WestHullensian> The greatest trick the Capitalists ever pulled was convincing the Left to spend every waking moment worrying about Fascists instead of bankers.

At the very least the economic collapse will make the UK unappealing to migrants.
1325529450637889536 2020-11-09 04:03:42 +0800 <WestHullensian> @InspectorDarren If you're the person who delivered the leaflets and the police approach you about this, just ask them if a crime has been committed, and if they tell you no, then you should politely refuse to speak to them any more. This is none of their business.

1321991364775731202 2020-10-30 09:44:37 +0800 <WestHullensian> @HumanRi56 @stevie_buscemi I would suggest that Native Americans are analogous to Native Europeans, not Native Britons. The breadth of difference between Native American halopgroups for example is far greater than between England and Holland (where the Beaker people are from) for example.
1321990267243778048 2020-10-30 09:40:15 +0800 <WestHullensian> @HumanRi56 @stevie_buscemi You'll have to decide which criteria you stand by first. Do we have to be descended from the first settlers? Do we have to be genetically similar? What about language? You seem to be trying to construct a definition designed to fit one group(s) but not the other.
1321985079816630279 2020-10-30 09:19:38 +0800 <WestHullensian> @HumanRi56 @stevie_buscemi Based on your criteria? None of them. The waves of migration that make up Native American populations come from far more disparate and numerous origins than the relatively modest North West European migrations that make up the White British population.
1321984055416598529 2020-10-30 09:15:34 +0800 <WestHullensian> @HumanRi56 @stevie_buscemi I'd rather just look up the etymology of the word and see that it was adapted from Latin hundreds of years before your post modernist identity politics emerged.
1321982901982998528 2020-10-30 09:10:59 +0800 <WestHullensian> @HumanRi56 @stevie_buscemi You're a) moving the goalposts and b) providing yet another criteria that Native Americans would fail to meet.
1321980163601694721 2020-10-30 09:00:06 +0800 <WestHullensian> @HumanRi56 @stevie_buscemi The term is not "meant for oppressed peoples". It is not beneath Europeans to want to preserve a homeland for our people. There's semingly a bigotry of low expectations at play when it comes to the rejection of such an egalitarian stance, as if we're somehow above the lowly BAME.
1321978546718445569 2020-10-30 08:53:41 +0800 <WestHullensian> @HumanRi56 @stevie_buscemi You're pulling your definitions out of thin air.
1321978280451473408 2020-10-30 08:52:37 +0800 <WestHullensian> @HumanRi56 @stevie_buscemi The article you cite literally outlines how we are descended from from the first settlers. If you read it, you didn't understand it.   Paleo-Indians are not a homogeneous group. There were numerous migrations of different peoples, no more closely related than NW Europeans.
1321976885425954816 2020-10-30 08:47:05 +0800 <WestHullensian> @HumanRi56 @stevie_buscemi And how on Earth could the violent displacement and dispossession of a native people by ethnic strangers in our past ever serve as proof that we should let it happen again? The problem with your position is that insist on attacking this weird 'racial purity' straw man.
1321976008157859841 2020-10-30 08:43:36 +0800 <WestHullensian> @HumanRi56 @stevie_buscemi But again, engage your brain and apply this to other peoples. There was more than one migration wave from East Asia to the Americas, does that mean Native Americans are not native?
1321974310253273088 2020-10-30 08:36:51 +0800 <WestHullensian> @DanielJHannan It's in large part because leftists set up endless charities and thinktanks and appoint themselves experts within the grievance industry.

1321970761511391232 2020-10-30 08:22:45 +0800 <WestHullensian> @HumanRi56 @stevie_buscemi And if racial purity is your criteria, then you'd better let the Natives Americans, Maori, Australian Aboriginals etc. know that they're not indigenous peoples either.
1321969861191438337 2020-10-30 08:19:10 +0800 <WestHullensian> @HumanRi56 @stevie_buscemi I'm sorry but you're making assertions that are objectively untrue. The only region of the UK where White British people have any significant non-indigenous DNA is in England, where up to 40% of it comes from Angles/Saxons/Jutes.

1321746412351213569 2020-10-29 17:31:16 +0800 <WestHullensian> @SkyNewsBreak Would there actually be any negative consequences to ending all migration from Islamic countries? It appears to be a net negative for the West at the moment.

If an African population wanted to avoid such an end, would deride them?

The number of people that die of malnutrition every year is very low, double figures in every year I can find reference to. I can't find data on the ages, but it seems to be an issue primarily (exclusively?) for the elderly.

Yes, food banks are used almost exclusively to supplement income that can then be used elsewhere. I have no problem with voluntary charity. But mandating that the public further subsidise bad parenting is wrong.

1316882049551208449 2020-10-16 07:22:01 +0800 <WestHullensian> It's funny how Twitter went down as soon as the Biden stuff started to catch fire.

1316854511168819203 2020-10-16 05:32:36 +0800 <WestHullensian> @fight_far @jrc1921 I don't ignore them. , but they have nothing to do with a point about the things the Left ignores, as you have enthusiastically demonstrated, so there was no reason for me to arbitrarily bring them up.
1316850872287191043 2020-10-16 05:18:08 +0800 <WestHullensian> @fight_far @jrc1921 I've covered this already.

1316843374335361029 2020-10-16 04:48:20 +0800 <WestHullensian> @TheDukeofNorton @themetrobolist @jrc1921 You people have been parroting the same propaganda for so long that you genuinely believe it's true.
1316838925332369411 2020-10-16 04:30:40 +0800 <WestHullensian> @TheDukeofNorton @themetrobolist @jrc1921 It's self-evident. The Labour councillors close to the cases ignored them, their Leftist media allies did likewise, and when the whole thing blew up they both spent more time warning against "islamophobia" than admitting there was an issue with Pakistani communities.
1316837710158594051 2020-10-16 04:25:50 +0800 <WestHullensian> @TheDukeofNorton @jrc1921 In-group bias is healthy and normal. I have no qualms about admitting that I am pro-White British. Why wouldn't I take my own side? If we can stop some of my people being raped, trafficked and tortured as children by racial strangers, why wouldn't I advocate for that?
1316836333885812739 2020-10-16 04:20:22 +0800 <WestHullensian> @bc_cb_ I don't know.  Maybe you could just say what you mean?

1316834160275791873 2020-10-16 04:11:44 +0800 <WestHullensian> @themetrobolist @TheDukeofNorton @jrc1921 Why do you people act like racism is the most serious transgression in the universe? Why would you rather children be raped en masse than risk 'stoking racial tensions'?
1316833729508265984 2020-10-16 04:10:01 +0800 <WestHullensian> @TheDukeofNorton @jrc1921 Not so for gang grooming, but yes on the broader crime of sexual assault as you would expect given the current demographics. We have yet no solution for sexual assault in general, but we could save so many potential child victims by ending all migration from Pakistan to the UK.
1316832062125604866 2020-10-16 04:03:23 +0800 <WestHullensian> @bc_cb_ @jrc1921 I've never heard that before. He should be prosecuted if true.  But why, as a Nationalist, you would imagine that I might have a positive view of a Zionist shill like Tommy Robinson I have no idea.
1316767764015730688 2020-10-15 23:47:53 +0800 <WestHullensian> @jrc1921 It's strange that Leftist minds go to this kind of thing, but not the industrial scale rape of working class White children by Pakistani gangs.

The guy on the street quite likes it when an African sportsman wins something for England or Britain or whoever. It's probably one of the hardest groups of foreigners to get people to disassociate themselves with.
1316344839915659264 2020-10-14 19:47:20 +0800 <WestHullensian> @hnhcommunity The race relations industry and associated grifters will always have a financial incentive to perpetuate the perception that people are being attacked and abused because of their race. They prey on the gullible, those with more money than sense.

1316243831529123841 2020-10-14 13:05:58 +0800 <WestHullensian> @AltNewsMedia @BBCNews Actually, the Communications Act does make it a police matter if the content was shared electronically. Free speech does not exist in the UK. Dankula, or example, was not prosecuted for "hate speech", he was prosecuted for offensive speech.

1315870699525939200 2020-10-13 12:23:17 +0800 <WestHullensian> @KeithWoodsYT I wonder how much of the bias is even conscious too. When Jack appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast and Tim Pool challenged him on it, he and his colleague seemed to genuinely just trust the self-appointed harm-detecting "experts" to tell them what they needed to censor.

There is no historical precedent for a group profiting from shifting from majority to minority status.   Oppression is the best case scenario.

They demonstrate that in violent altercations with police in the US, you're more likely to die if you're White than if you're Black.   The numbers also shine a light on how much more crime Black people commit per capita on both sides of the Atlantic.

The freer the system the more the market dictates the policy, not the other way around. Private institutions become more powerful than the state, and by extension the people.

We accepted relatively modest levels of migration (compared to today) at the same time that we were giving people money to resettle in Australia.

1309067299576569858 2020-09-24 17:49:00 +0800 <WestHullensian> @BritannicBysta1 I think this could be a tipping point in the UK if they try to do this. The polling data suggests that people want harsher measures to be taken, but anecdotally at least I find that very difficult to believe.

It would still be up to the UK to negotiate it with them of course, but plenty of big players would want it to happen.

The UK's position breaks the rules of the club? What does that even mean? The EU already has lots of FTO's with nations it is not in regulatory alignment with? What on Earth are you waffling about?

The UK's position is reasonable, the EU's isn't. They demand we sacrifice sovereignty, we demand they sacrifice nothing.
1309061664248147969 2020-09-24 17:26:36 +0800 <WestHullensian> @nimmoben12 This is a conditioned response.

1307419982150729733 2020-09-20 04:43:09 +0800 <WestHullensian> @CaptainCorona4 @BritishAlba @pritipatel I'm not sure if you're aware, but it is possible to export fish. The French, for example, get two thirds of their entire fishing haul from British waters. It would also be great culturally and environmentally if we could change our seafood eating habits.
1307415538122076161 2020-09-20 04:25:29 +0800 <WestHullensian> @CaptainCorona4 @BritishAlba @pritipatel Well, the ability to control immigration, negotiate your own trade deals, monopolise your own fishing waters and actually decide upon the laws that govern your country is pretty sweet.

The Capitalist system you seem wedded to is neither sustainable nor desirable. It not only demands high levels of immigration, but levels that increase exponentially. It's a pyramid scheme.

It's one of the most one-sides issues in the country. At least the Tories have the nous to lie about their migration policy.

1302217505155567618 2020-09-05 20:10:21 +0800 <WestHullensian> @MattHancock It's time for genuine Conservatives, Patriots and Nationalists to abandon the Tory party. They are conservative in name only, and will follow the Liberal ethic of the Left as closely as they can without losing your vote. It's time for an alternative.   https://t.co/f4aNgxlNgI

1302215494569807872 2020-09-05 20:02:22 +0800 <WestHullensian> @PatAlternative "Migrants Not Welcome", of course.  I do think that for the future though, "No White Guilt" is a better slogan than "White Lives Matter", which I think some members of the public would see as purely reactionary.
1302213576174850049 2020-09-05 19:54:45 +0800 <WestHullensian> The demo at Dover is a joke. The majority of the public are distracted by Extinction Rebellion's latest antics, and the ones who aren't can only hear this Nobby character shouting profanity through a loudspeaker.
1302213006668034050 2020-09-05 19:52:29 +0800 <WestHullensian> @RealProfTwatter @jjcwow When we allowed the Tories to pretend that they're Conservatives.  They could stop the rot in a matter of months with an 80 majority, but at their core they're just Liberal Capitalists who will lean right on social issues just enough to pinch the votes they need.

1301514195113062408 2020-09-03 21:35:39 +0800 <WestHullensian> @tomhfh A Tory party enthusiastically supporting gay marriage should have been one of the first red flags for genuine conservatives.  In retrospect though, patriots should probably have been far more concerned by the collapse of real marriage than what the gays were up to.
