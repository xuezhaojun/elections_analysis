1319603968385994758 2020-10-23 19:37:57 +0800 <RealRevDan> All of my accomplishments and accolades don’t matter.   Only eternity with Jesus matters.   To live is to die.  To Christ is to gain.
1319446384953708544 2020-10-23 09:11:46 +0800 <RealRevDan> A person finds joy in giving an apt reply— and how good is a timely word!  Proverbs 15:23

1318967247793160192 2020-10-22 01:27:51 +0800 <RealRevDan> If the new normal is we have people getting threatened for their political views, having violence brought against them, how far away are we from having that happen to people for their faith?

1318923260835340288 2020-10-21 22:33:04 +0800 <RealRevDan> Let me get this straight, we can destroy ISIS but not stop Antifa?

1318588583784157186 2020-10-21 00:23:11 +0800 <RealRevDan> Romans 8:6-8 The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace; the sinful mind is hostile to God.

1317856990555561985 2020-10-18 23:56:05 +0800 <RealRevDan> Why are we paying teachers to teach anti American anti Christ values?
1317795580517732353 2020-10-18 19:52:04 +0800 <RealRevDan> Proverbs 17:28 Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps silent, and discerning if he holds his tongue.

1317472901537345537 2020-10-17 22:29:51 +0800 <RealRevDan> If you support globalism you support the restriction and elimination of personal freedoms.   Further, if you support globalism you are already unfit for the Kingdom of Christ and are ripe to be deceived by the coming anti-Christ.
1317439689176043520 2020-10-17 20:17:53 +0800 <RealRevDan> Matt 28:5-7 Do not be afraid, I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just as he said.

1317205278581018624 2020-10-17 04:46:25 +0800 <RealRevDan> Do you know Jesus as Savior --Good, but that is fire insurance  Do you know Jesus as Lord? Because that means you will follow His commands.   If you are not following His commands then you are recognizing a different Lord.
1317197229938147330 2020-10-17 04:14:26 +0800 <RealRevDan> Pro 6:6-10 Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise! It has no commander, no overseer or ruler, yet it stores its provisions in summer &amp; gathers its food at harvest. How long will you lie there, you sluggard?

1316763409745051648 2020-10-15 23:30:35 +0800 <RealRevDan> This is more than a political issue.   This is #SpiritualWarfare
1316759605830193152 2020-10-15 23:15:28 +0800 <RealRevDan> @BeverlyJPeters2 Doesn't mean it has occurred here. He is now Hollywood which doesn't help his case much.
1316751479051620353 2020-10-15 22:43:11 +0800 <RealRevDan> Media &amp; education now mocks marriage They mock church They mock worship to #YHWY They mock loyalty  They mock skin color  They mock traditional Christian values  They mock those who work for what they have  Now tell me who dividing the nation.
1316748747829850112 2020-10-15 22:32:20 +0800 <RealRevDan> I think we are seeing come to light that the orchestrators of evil are always using projection as a method to label their enemies for their own activities.
1316560303656763392 2020-10-15 10:03:31 +0800 <RealRevDan> #Jesus  Freely given, and we choose the choice to lose  (now we know) As these scars are screaming at me - just why we've chosen poorly. Could it be our chance to see why we believe  ----that we need YOU instead of following numbly?

1315429492643504129 2020-10-12 07:10:05 +0800 <RealRevDan> Long overdue. Maybe we can see morality flourish in the public schools now.
1315425788259373056 2020-10-12 06:55:22 +0800 <RealRevDan> By faith Abraham even though he was past age &amp; Sarah herself was barren was enabled to become a father because he considered him faithful who had made the promise.   Hebrews 11:11

1313859141308383232 2020-10-07 23:10:04 +0800 <RealRevDan> Instead of telling your pastor -Good Sermon or Good Message how about telling your pastor how it just may have changed your world, point of view or thinking.   This is what pastors really want to hear from their flock.
1313816678082514945 2020-10-07 20:21:20 +0800 <RealRevDan> John 14.6 Jesus said, “I am the way, the truth, &amp; the life. No one comes to the Father except thru Me.
