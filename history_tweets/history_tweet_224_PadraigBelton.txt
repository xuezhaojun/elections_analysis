1335665429918969856 2020-12-07 03:20:28 +0800 <PadraigBelton> No one quite knows why Dublin's arms are a literal house on fire.  They're granted to the Corporation in 1607, but the castle as a motif first appears in this 13th century seal. The flames may (?) represent the readiness of Dublin's citizens to defend their city. Eg, against Mayo  https://t.co/Psj7xulBh9
1335664195896020993 2020-12-07 03:15:34 +0800 <PadraigBelton> The flaming castle makes a cameo, too, in the fourth quarter of the (1862) arms of the University of Dublin (the 'castle of two towers argent, flamant proper'). They first appeared in a degree certificate in 1963, this one.  https://t.co/Xm5v0tV9nQ

1325011631139663872 2020-11-07 17:46:05 +0800 <PadraigBelton> tl;dr: 70 per cent of the presidents to have sought a second term, won.
1325008760369197056 2020-11-07 17:34:40 +0800 <PadraigBelton> @AoifeMFoley Well maybe 70% if you put the 21 who stood for a second term and won (eventually, in the case of Cleveland), against the 9 who stood for a second term and didn't.   Yes I'm slightly too invested.
1324979033155768325 2020-11-07 15:36:33 +0800 <PadraigBelton> So of the 84,562 days between George Washington became president and today, the US had multi-term presidents for 57,030 of them (67.44%).

Biden leads in Maricopa (5-23% votes uncounted), in Cocino (12-20%), and in Pima counties, (5-14%).  Trump leads in Cochise (18-25%), Greenlee (20-27%) and Pinal counties (16-24%).  They'll both add votes. Meanwhile Biden's +3.4.

1324032216675078144 2020-11-05 00:54:14 +0800 <PadraigBelton> And the Michigan votes still uncounted are from areas that are heavily Democrat:  In Detroit, 14 to 22% of votes are uncounted. Biden wins there 67-31.8%  In Kalamazoo, 15 to 23% of ballots are uncounted. Biden leads there 54-43.9%.  And 3-12% of Ingham County (Biden by 65.2-33%)
1324015746700267522 2020-11-04 23:48:47 +0800 <PadraigBelton> On 5.10m votes counted, Biden was leading in Michigan by 0.2%. On 5.11m votes, this increased to 0.3%. On 5.18m he was ahead 0.7%.  I‚Äôm sitting on a park bench in Dublin hitting reload so you don‚Äôt have to..

1323988557275561984 2020-11-04 22:00:45 +0800 <PadraigBelton> Feeding into this too is that Biden has been winning Pennsylvania postal ballots by 78 per cent to 21 per cent, according to the Pennsylvania secretary of state. And we know Michigan had about 3.1 million postal ballots.
1323986153830318081 2020-11-04 21:51:12 +0800 <PadraigBelton> The thinking here seems to be: Biden had a +4.6 per cent lead in Pennsylvania polls, which wasn't enough. But he seems to be winning states where he led by 7 (like Minnesota) or 7.3 (leading in Wisconsin). And he had a +7 poll lead in Michigan.  https://t.co/4ELHcbElc8
1323982366965194754 2020-11-04 21:36:09 +0800 <PadraigBelton> One site is giving Michigan a 76.9 per cent chance of tilting into Biden's camp. Which coupled with Nevada would be all he needs.

A UK licence is a handy UK government-issued form of identity, for people whose passports are from Ireland: we've already seen banks declining to accept EU passports.  (‚òùÔ∏èIt me.)

1309588237208432645 2020-09-26 04:19:01 +0800 <PadraigBelton> I wondered why this little girl insists on sleeping in the middle of the bed.   Then I realised she was leaving room for mummy, in London.  https://t.co/yHfClt3ygL
