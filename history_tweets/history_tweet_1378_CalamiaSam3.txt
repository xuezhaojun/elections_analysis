1333505537833570304 2020-12-01 04:17:50 +0800 <CalamiaSam3> @afroponylicious @charliekirk11 I believe Cuomo and Newsom spoke highly of the federal government‚Äôs assistance earlier this year.  And I see to remember Cuomo giving his news conferences with stacks of supplies behind him.  If he had enough equipment to use as props for his TV show they had enough.
1333440000340488192 2020-11-30 23:57:24 +0800 <CalamiaSam3> @afroponylicious @charliekirk11 Maybe if he could have focused on one city it could have been his home town.  But then again it wasn‚Äôt his responsibility as president to manage the workings of a single American city.  But this inner city violence didn‚Äôt start with Obama or Trump.  It‚Äôs nothing new, it‚Äôs sad.

And Americans aren‚Äôt the healthiest people either.  Too much junk food, not enough vitamins and minerals.  People that live in less developed parts of the world are tough.

But from what I see right now the real threat to America is progressive democrats.  We have cities and states that have implemented these policies and I think the results speak for themselves.

I still disagree with that scene at the school.  I don‚Äôt think it was necessary to arrest her but she could have handled it differently instead of making a scene

The guy gave me a ticket and there was no law broken.  I spoke with him for a minute and then just took the ticket.  Got it dismissed when I went to court.
1309467149438681090 2020-09-25 20:17:51 +0800 <CalamiaSam3> @refusalxx Yeah, we may or may not find out what the real deal is.  But, fighting or arguing with the police once things get heated isn‚Äôt  the right way to handle those disagreements.  I think it sucks but it is what it is.
1309466428605706241 2020-09-25 20:14:59 +0800 <CalamiaSam3> @refusalxx Let me say I don‚Äôt have 100% of the facts.  But I heard this morning the school has a rule that people must wear masks on school property.  May or may not be true but that‚Äôs what I heard.
1309465548640653312 2020-09-25 20:11:30 +0800 <CalamiaSam3> @refusalxx I don‚Äôt think she should have been arrested.  But, as a rule it‚Äôs not a good idea to ignore commands from law enforcement or to resist arrest.

I guess good looks can take you further than I thought possible.  I would have thought you‚Äôd need some actual substance to win an election.  I was wrong.

1308386583675052033 2020-09-22 20:44:04 +0800 <CalamiaSam3> @DanielSchoel @ReneeAponte @FOX13News Really, so if a police officer sees you run over somebody, stab or shoot someone you‚Äôre not guilty? That person is witness to the crime.  In some cases having to go through the courts is just a procedural process. Reaching or attempting to use a deadly weapon will get you shot.

But, I‚Äôd venture to say that people regardless of race have negative or deadly interactions with law enforcement when they are guilty of a crime and / or resist arrest.
1308289473583525893 2020-09-22 14:18:12 +0800 <CalamiaSam3> @DanielSchoel @ReneeAponte @FOX13News I see them all the time.   But rarely have to interact with one.  8 times out of 10 why would an individual have to deal with a LEO?  It‚Äôs usually that you‚Äôre the one reporting a crime or committing one.  Cops don‚Äôt typically ride around arresting people for no reason.

He knew about and was involved in crossfire Hurricane.  He eulogized Byrd, a known KKK member.  He‚Äôs a shitbag.  If you need more I can get back with you.

He‚Äôs voted for every war to come down the pipe.  He‚Äôs a racist having pushed the 90‚Äôs crime bill that incarcerated generations of people for bs drug charges.  He‚Äôs sold out American workers to China.  He withheld funds
