1325151687791632385 2020-11-08 03:02:37 +0800 <Olgachristie> Absolutely remarkable given he had so few followers at the few rallies he held don’t you think......must be his charisma that got him the most votes in history.  Quite incredible🙄
1325149727969533952 2020-11-08 02:54:49 +0800 <Olgachristie> And yet we allow hordes of illegal migrants in boats to come from France no questions asked.  Doesn’t take rocket science to think potential terrorists could infiltrate our country this way, and yet our hapless Border Force don’t  see the problem. Insanity😡
1325148162156158977 2020-11-08 02:48:36 +0800 <Olgachristie> It doesn’t take rocket science to explain the difference....or maybe it does if your part of MSM🙄😏

1325032059941888000 2020-11-07 19:07:15 +0800 <Olgachristie> Certainly ‘grit and resilience’ is needed if what we are seeing on social media about alleged ‘irregularities’ of postal votes (which we’re not a fan of over here) is true🙄😳

1324962175480451072 2020-11-07 14:29:33 +0800 <Olgachristie> And Boris will probably capitulate🤨
1324957294392700929 2020-11-07 14:10:10 +0800 <Olgachristie> A no-deal Brexit is a less palatable option with a new US administration that has already made clear there will be no trade deal with Britain unless the prime minister sticks to the terms of the withdrawal agreement and Northern Ireland protocol.

1321367287102902273 2020-10-28 16:24:45 +0800 <Olgachristie> It is tragic but if these people were genuine refugees as you claim they should have claimed asylum in France or any of the other safe countries they passed through and would have been grateful for sanctuary in any of those countries.

1321323549441875968 2020-10-28 13:30:57 +0800 <Olgachristie> Yes it is heartbreaking but totally preventable. You know full well there is no ‘war or persecution ‘ in France. They could and should have claimed asylum there and not attempted to cross what is a very dangerous Channel this time of year.
1321320220443725826 2020-10-28 13:17:44 +0800 <Olgachristie> It was sadly inevitable. France MUST step up their border patrols and start earning the millions we‘re paying them. And we MUST stop the *4 star hotel* magnet that draws them across a very dangerous Channel. France is a safe country and they should claim asylum there.
1321171152480423940 2020-10-28 03:25:23 +0800 <Olgachristie> It’s tragic, but there is no war or persecution in France. Those people and the thousands who have come across the channel could have had safe sanctuary in France.

1314431580107083782 2020-10-09 13:04:44 +0800 <Olgachristie> Lammy squirming a bit....well done @AlexChalkChelt 👏👏
1314430684962881537 2020-10-09 13:01:10 +0800 <Olgachristie> The usual suspects (named) charged with offences relating to nine girls, aged between 12 and 16 between 2011 and 2017.  The poor girls are getting younger.  Vile scumbags😡    https://t.co/UsDndjfbCa

1314426659995611136 2020-10-09 12:45:11 +0800 <Olgachristie> But he did allow mass gatherings to go ahead in Manchester🙄
1314126028160335878 2020-10-08 16:50:35 +0800 <Olgachristie> ‘Figures disclosed to The Times last week showed a disused 40-year-old ferry could be bought from Italy for £6million. It could house 1,400 migrants in 141 cabins.’  Great. Might even deter some thinking they will be housed in 4* hotels😏  https://t.co/FG8ccWW3U6

1314067519691468801 2020-10-08 12:58:05 +0800 <Olgachristie> So climate change is racist, is that what you’re saying?🙄
1314051080733552640 2020-10-08 11:52:46 +0800 <Olgachristie> I don’t think it would.  So much lighter to handle than a book, you can adjust the print size and line spacing on a kindle and of course downloading a kindle book is typically cheaper than buying a physical book.
1313939997800751109 2020-10-08 04:31:21 +0800 <Olgachristie> We have put our cards on the table.....tick tock🙄
1313794683299037184 2020-10-07 18:53:56 +0800 <Olgachristie> Here’s a thought (probably alien to the HAC) but how about some compassion and putting our own homeless first for a change🙄🤨
1313766474356609024 2020-10-07 17:01:50 +0800 <Olgachristie> Reading it now....fabulous, heartwarming book❤️
1313742279010668544 2020-10-07 15:25:42 +0800 <Olgachristie> That photo is certainly not indicative of the mainly young male illegal migrants crossing the Channel.  We know it and you know it Luke🙄
1313699767759835137 2020-10-07 12:36:46 +0800 <Olgachristie> And will all the illegal migrants that are brought in via your Border Force taxi service be allowed their extended families to join them?  Meanwhile we have thousands of our own homeless including veterans ignored.  Shameful😡
1313340170163441664 2020-10-06 12:47:51 +0800 <Olgachristie> I’m sure most sensible people would refuse an untested vaccine which had had no safety trials🤨
1313111359597547520 2020-10-05 21:38:39 +0800 <Olgachristie> He does have that unfortunate ‘deer in the headlights’ face doesn’t he😏
1313110395750617089 2020-10-05 21:34:49 +0800 <Olgachristie> I think at the moment the wind and rain is doing a better job of deterring the dinghies😏
1313106439850856448 2020-10-05 21:19:06 +0800 <Olgachristie> 😳🤣
1313082500844007424 2020-10-05 19:43:58 +0800 <Olgachristie> If it follows the pattern of other grooming gang trials, they will all be out on bail before the trial🤨
1313055138253340672 2020-10-05 17:55:15 +0800 <Olgachristie> But then why not have a ‘safe space’ for white employees to talk about the trauma resulting from seeing statues and monuments torn down and desecrated resulting from events surrounding BLM?🙄
1313052125350551557 2020-10-05 17:43:16 +0800 <Olgachristie> She’s great at words.....pity they’re not matched by action🙄
1312994441775456257 2020-10-05 13:54:03 +0800 <Olgachristie> Given he has a glass partition between him and those in the front and all were masked where is the “irresponsibility”🤔
1312981275708461056 2020-10-05 13:01:44 +0800 <Olgachristie> And without action.....talk about firmness is pointless🤨
1312801315119075334 2020-10-05 01:06:38 +0800 <Olgachristie> It will be quite alien for SkyNews to put a positive spin on anything Trump related🙄
1312799746126475265 2020-10-05 01:00:24 +0800 <Olgachristie> ‘Vulnerable refugees,desperate for help’?🙄  More like economic migrants cherry picking the country  with the most benefits ie UK.....obviously France doesn’t provide 4* hotel accommodation🤨
1312656384740274179 2020-10-04 15:30:44 +0800 <Olgachristie> Morning to you too Peter and the follow, have a good day...weather better than yesterday!😀
1312620079041871873 2020-10-04 13:06:28 +0800 <Olgachristie> What I’d like to know is how come Channel 4 were able to find the place where a large number of illegals were hiding (and interviewed them) the day before they came across in their dinghies yet the French authorities were apparently unable to do so and stop them?🤔🤨
1312618745018417152 2020-10-04 13:01:10 +0800 <Olgachristie> The quintessential English country pub.....beautiful😃
1312617527424552961 2020-10-04 12:56:20 +0800 <Olgachristie> Global recruitment is fine but the priority should be training our own unemployed in trades and professions to fill those vacancies.
1312614739797831681 2020-10-04 12:45:15 +0800 <Olgachristie> ‘Respectful’?   You mean like Tusk saying “There is a special place in hell for Brexiteers”🙄🤨

1312453762343079936 2020-10-04 02:05:35 +0800 <Olgachristie> Please, please don’t give them an inch over our fishing waters and certainly no 3 year transition as reported in the Guardian David....17.4 million of us will be watching very closely indeed😏
1312359654081654784 2020-10-03 19:51:38 +0800 <Olgachristie> As clear as mud to me. ‘Safe space’ from whom exactly....their fellow employees, Sainsbury’s shoppers??  Somebody help us out here🤔
1312357923595714562 2020-10-03 19:44:46 +0800 <Olgachristie> The might have to kick a few thousand illegals out of them if  they attempt to do that😳😏
1312339118697967616 2020-10-03 18:30:02 +0800 <Olgachristie> ‘Record numbers of illegal immigrants crossing the English Channel are “not a threat” to Britain, and could even be a boon for taxpayers, the UN has claimed’.

1312288014295592961 2020-10-03 15:06:58 +0800 <Olgachristie> Please explain ⁦@pritipatel⁩ why the person who committed arson and criminal damage at this camp is not being charged under the Criminal Damages Act 1971.

1312281180138598400 2020-10-03 14:39:49 +0800 <Olgachristie> A 29 yr old man arrested on suspicion of arson and criminal damage at the Penally asylum centre has been dealt with by 'adult community resolution' and no further charges will be brought.

1312090232112775169 2020-10-03 02:01:03 +0800 <Olgachristie> Isn’t advertising all about trying to increase your customer base not posting aggressive tweets like this attempting to alienate them.  Reckon you need better PR.....read your replies🤨
1312087773927661574 2020-10-03 01:51:17 +0800 <Olgachristie> ”On fisheries the gap between us is unfortunately very large and, without further realism and flexibility from the EU, risks being impossible to bridge.

1312086002605924354 2020-10-03 01:44:15 +0800 <Olgachristie> Funny how reporters can find these migrants, yet the French authorities who we are paying millions to fail to locate them...hmm🤔🤨
1311982710940983301 2020-10-02 18:53:48 +0800 <Olgachristie> 1 star hotels?   I think you mean 4 star hotels Andrew😏 Yes, it certainly worked in Australia, never had an illegal  migrant problem since, but I don’t think @pritipatel has the  backbone to do it here.
1311933793381560320 2020-10-02 15:39:25 +0800 <Olgachristie> “Are you sure we’re not breaking the rule of six Diane?”🤣

1311903968998678529 2020-10-02 13:40:54 +0800 <Olgachristie> Even the BBC can’t change the fact that the Yorkshire Dales in the 50s was all white🙄
1311894675792572416 2020-10-02 13:03:59 +0800 <Olgachristie> They already are...not only ‘knocking on our door‘ but getting keys to their 4* hotel accommodation🤨
1311889270890795008 2020-10-02 12:42:30 +0800 <Olgachristie> I was too Sue -  thought I would miss live tv, but I don’t.  I get all the news from online papers, and so much to watch on catch-up (apart from iPlayer of course). And I also have Netflix which is brilliant😃

1311887152108769280 2020-10-02 12:34:05 +0800 <Olgachristie> I think we all know why they refused the remake of All Creatures Great and Small (their loss but C5’s gain...it was their highest audience for any programme ever)

1310803377610260481 2020-09-29 12:47:33 +0800 <Olgachristie> Such a sense of entitlement...they think they are entitled to live anywhere they want, they think they are entitled to en-suite rooms.  Their present accommodation was deemed suitable for our armed forces and far better than where they came from😡
1310628116524658688 2020-09-29 01:11:07 +0800 <Olgachristie> Reckon they could do with a bit of that🙄
1310627907874816000 2020-09-29 01:10:18 +0800 <Olgachristie> Have you tried sugar free biccies Mr B...the dark choccie digestives are great😃
1310596971246350336 2020-09-28 23:07:22 +0800 <Olgachristie> Stating the bleeding obvious. What is ‘ideal’ is stopping them coming here in the first place🤨
1310583216634503170 2020-09-28 22:12:42 +0800 <Olgachristie> I think people just want to know why she is not wearing a mask when all your other officers were?🤔
1310582397428260864 2020-09-28 22:09:27 +0800 <Olgachristie> They’re not locked up though Peter. They are free to come and go during daylight hours with no supervision.
1310579342938902528 2020-09-28 21:57:19 +0800 <Olgachristie> While forging ahead with HS2 which will be disastrous for our countryside and wildlife😡
1310574321300131841 2020-09-28 21:37:22 +0800 <Olgachristie> You do know that HS2 is causing massive environmental damage to our beautiful countryside and wildlife don’t you?😡
1310538562903965697 2020-09-28 19:15:16 +0800 <Olgachristie> Even more relevant that she has done sod all since then😡
1310538275803852801 2020-09-28 19:14:08 +0800 <Olgachristie> A lot of care homes are privately owned by millionaires...why can’t they buy them?🤔
1310535485769551878 2020-09-28 19:03:03 +0800 <Olgachristie> And when our whole infrastructure collapses with half of Africa here, those idiots will still be ok in their mansions and sod the rest of us😡#Idiots
1310532017013116928 2020-09-28 18:49:16 +0800 <Olgachristie> Talking of tax avoidance *cough*🙄#hypocrite  https://t.co/lIGk9ZLIlM
1310504136857866245 2020-09-28 16:58:28 +0800 <Olgachristie> Brilliant news....you stopped being funny years ago🙄#DefundTheBBC
1310450045884542976 2020-09-28 13:23:32 +0800 <Olgachristie> “In Rennes, but also in Paris, Nantes, Bordeaux, Brest… We have to deal with drug trafficking. And also with the presence of young, desocialised foreigners wandering around.”  Will we see the same problem....time will tell?😡  https://t.co/6O2xTalDDR
1310218961561300998 2020-09-27 22:05:17 +0800 <Olgachristie> Why would we import cheddar cheese and mince...do we have a shortage of cows Faisal?🙄

1309900681432772608 2020-09-27 01:00:33 +0800 <Olgachristie> I don’t recall you tweeting similar for the BLM large gatherings....hmm🤔
1309867120138821633 2020-09-26 22:47:12 +0800 <Olgachristie> Police have appealed for witnesses after a man attempted to abduct two young girls into his van on separate days..a 10 yr old girl on Wednesday and a 9 yr old girl on Thursday. He is described as Asian with a bald head and facial hair.   https://t.co/DCCA84Fr8A
1309810996618424321 2020-09-26 19:04:11 +0800 <Olgachristie> Not yet, but was known to police apparently and deemed a ‘potential terror threat’ which begs the question why was he not either deported if he came here recently or being carefully monitored?😡
1309768203481079813 2020-09-26 16:14:08 +0800 <Olgachristie> If we hear of any crimes committed by these supposed ‘law-abiding vulnerable people’ then this ridiculous statement will come back to haunt the Home Office and so  it should. We will see.🤨
1309766168111128576 2020-09-26 16:06:03 +0800 <Olgachristie> We like strong winds in the channel....the stronger the better.  Does the job our hapless Home Office should be doing, deterring the dinghies😏
1309749606763433984 2020-09-26 15:00:14 +0800 <Olgachristie> Brilliant....really hope you bring @Nigel_Farage on board.....he always reports on news the public want and need to know which MSM either ignore or too afraid to report😀
1309738036855558144 2020-09-26 14:14:16 +0800 <Olgachristie> Great job little guys👏👏
1309592724421644289 2020-09-26 04:36:51 +0800 <Olgachristie> “If anyone was to test positive they would be put into isolation, but Ms Duggal (Kent Council) admits there is "nothing to stop them from going out. They would not be going to Tesco, etc there is nothing to stop them going out”  Unbelievable😡😡  https://t.co/s8xNfrdwno
1309590035465940993 2020-09-26 04:26:10 +0800 <Olgachristie> You’re well rid Andrew👏👏
1309589591767293953 2020-09-26 04:24:24 +0800 <Olgachristie> So concerned local people are now ‘far right fuel hate’ according to the BBC😡 #DefundTheBBC   https://t.co/qaihUa2CNs
1309544560872296448 2020-09-26 01:25:28 +0800 <Olgachristie> The fact he was on the terrorist watch list tells you all you need to know😡
1309542340395139073 2020-09-26 01:16:38 +0800 <Olgachristie> How can this be acceptable when we have our own people who are sleeping on the streets including homeless veterans who have fought for this country.  Disgraceful doesn’t begin to describe it.😡😡
1309539928183799808 2020-09-26 01:07:03 +0800 <Olgachristie> All courtesy of the taxpayer😡 So now they can contact their mates in Calais and tell them to get on the next available dinghy. The Home Office are not fit for purpose😡
1309538792588574726 2020-09-26 01:02:32 +0800 <Olgachristie> I think the public need to know if what we are hearing is true...that the perpetrator was known to authorities and deemed a ‘potential terrorist threat’ and had been referred to a specialist programme?😡
1309537239786029064 2020-09-26 00:56:22 +0800 <Olgachristie> 😡😡😡
1309536750495313922 2020-09-26 00:54:25 +0800 <Olgachristie> ‘Law-abiding, vulnerable’......you couldn’t make it up🙄 First, they have no idea if they have criminal records or not. And  we’ve seen footage of them....none of them look ‘vulnerable’.....they have iPhones and wear designer gear. The Home Office take is all for gullible fools😡
1309535508167614465 2020-09-26 00:49:29 +0800 <Olgachristie> They are already in a safe country France, therefore they are not refugees any more and could and should have claimed asylum there or any of the other safe countries they passed through. They are paying traffickers to get them here without authority which is illegal🤨
1309503065918185474 2020-09-25 22:40:34 +0800 <Olgachristie> But refuse to say how many of course😡
1309502735730044928 2020-09-25 22:39:16 +0800 <Olgachristie> That’s because the majority of them ARE single males🙄
1309501181262204929 2020-09-25 22:33:05 +0800 <Olgachristie> Our best friend👏
1309500618197827584 2020-09-25 22:30:51 +0800 <Olgachristie> It wouldn’t have been needed ‘urgently’ if your boss had got her act together and returned all the illegals as soon as they reach our waters😡
1309458565082624006 2020-09-25 19:43:45 +0800 <Olgachristie> 🤣🤣
1309457575990177792 2020-09-25 19:39:49 +0800 <Olgachristie> He was apparently arrested by 2 special constables in Croydon for acting strangely, searched and found to be carrying ammunition, handcuffed and taken to the custody centre.   https://t.co/20oVyTuROE
1309455939326668801 2020-09-25 19:33:19 +0800 <Olgachristie> Let’s hope the Home Secretary replies that her prime concern is ‘investing in the safety and well-being’ of citizens of this country first and always🤨
1309435625674862597 2020-09-25 18:12:35 +0800 <Olgachristie> “We're using these incredible cutting edge aircraft that are gathering images from the moment the boats are in French waters, right up to the coast of the UK”  You need to be returning them back to France then not monitoring them to Dover🤨  https://t.co/iXXBs7B89g
1309356330759729153 2020-09-25 12:57:30 +0800 <Olgachristie> If Italy can do it, why the hell don’t we @pritipatel?
1309346061253828608 2020-09-25 12:16:42 +0800 <Olgachristie> Yes, but you don’t need a gym to get fit.......exercise in the fresh air, power walking, jogging or cycling and it’s free and you don’t have to do the social distancing bit😏
1309344514419625984 2020-09-25 12:10:33 +0800 <Olgachristie> He is very articulate.....needs to give Boris a lesson or two on that😏
1309173029738553344 2020-09-25 00:49:08 +0800 <Olgachristie> Well said Widders👏👏
1309085878912987136 2020-09-24 19:02:49 +0800 <Olgachristie> Yes, that was an odd response from him...🤔
1309081359852371968 2020-09-24 18:44:52 +0800 <Olgachristie> What about the people here whose lives are becoming a ‘living hell’....those who live near where the illegal migrants are accommodated and are free to roam their neighbourhoods.  They have no idea if these men have criminal records and are too scared to walk alone😡
1309079608805986304 2020-09-24 18:37:54 +0800 <Olgachristie> We can only hope they last for the foreseeable future (sorry Dover folk)😏
1309078454789382146 2020-09-24 18:33:19 +0800 <Olgachristie> It’s not a crime to take a holiday DM...stop following her around and monitoring her every move and telling us what she had for dinner....leave her alone😡   https://t.co/Sbf6CwewYF
1309035654395854849 2020-09-24 15:43:15 +0800 <Olgachristie> “There can therefore be no doubt that Barnier’s remark about the fish in UK waters being ‘another story’ is completely and unambiguously false."  ⁦⁦@MichelBarnier⁩ Confirmation for you.  OUR fish, always have been, always will😏  https://t.co/qrmHkChYBD
1309028383611850755 2020-09-24 15:14:21 +0800 <Olgachristie> Within the localities where they are accommodated.
1309027819763175424 2020-09-24 15:12:07 +0800 <Olgachristie> So a couple who didn’t self-isolate when returning from abroad shown the long arm of the law....but hundreds of illegal migrants coming into Dover, who are not Covid tested are free to roam wherever they are taken without supervision....no lockdown for them😡
1309015042952749056 2020-09-24 14:21:21 +0800 <Olgachristie> Done😀
1309009898550841350 2020-09-24 14:00:54 +0800 <Olgachristie> Yep, sounds like the BBC🙄
1308989302349672448 2020-09-24 12:39:04 +0800 <Olgachristie> That word ‘plans’ again🙄
1308985386069299200 2020-09-24 12:23:30 +0800 <Olgachristie> 👏👏👏👏👏👏
1308782864381751302 2020-09-23 22:58:45 +0800 <Olgachristie> ‘New tactics’🙄 Because obviously the old ‘tactics’ didn’t work🤨
1308668660848959489 2020-09-23 15:24:57 +0800 <Olgachristie> Exactly....6 of them searching an elderly veteran’s car.  Totally pathetic😡
1308664282792501248 2020-09-23 15:07:33 +0800 <Olgachristie> The MSM must spend hours waiting for that rare pic of a child arriving among the 98% of young males.  They take us for idiots thinking we don’t know🤨
1308662941210869761 2020-09-23 15:02:13 +0800 <Olgachristie> The French always quick to let us know how many they returned to their shores.  Our Home Office more reticent to release figures that made it to Dover......upwards of 400 apparently🙄🤨
1308632896870125570 2020-09-23 13:02:50 +0800 <Olgachristie> Yes, you definitely need to discuss ’further operational work’ when upwards of 400 illegals reached Dover yesterday when you both must have had prior warning from intelligence sources in Calais that an influx was likely?  Were you asleep on the job?🙄🤨
1308499436948119553 2020-09-23 04:12:31 +0800 <Olgachristie> A very pathetic small drop in a very big ocean🙄 They will probably be back in Calais in a week.....
1308498077825871872 2020-09-23 04:07:07 +0800 <Olgachristie> So are you calling all patriotic people who love our country and flag ‘hard-right nationalists’? The only flag your lot seem to have any affection for is the EU one😡
1308453051125161986 2020-09-23 01:08:11 +0800 <Olgachristie> Yet today hundreds of illegal migrants came from Calais. If @Nigel_Farage was able to receive prior warning from intelligence sources in Calais yesterday, then you and the French MUST have also known. The public need to know why you did not act on this intelligence😡
1308419128613629956 2020-09-22 22:53:24 +0800 <Olgachristie> Ever get the feeling our new Clandestine Channel Threat Commander is a bit out of his depth.....well totally useless actually🙄🤨
1308378143368019968 2020-09-22 20:10:32 +0800 <Olgachristie> Army on the streets to keep us indoors while unlimited illegals from France pour in.  You couldn’t make it up😡
1308374913825288193 2020-09-22 19:57:42 +0800 <Olgachristie> Woah indeed😳🤨 I’ve a better idea...deploy the soldiers down at Dover instead😡
1308372026424467457 2020-09-22 19:46:14 +0800 <Olgachristie> You’re playing catch-up...over 300 arrived already before lunch😡
1308348475831193600 2020-09-22 18:12:39 +0800 <Olgachristie> Care to comment @pritipatel? If @Nigel_Farage received prior warning from intelligence sources in Calais yesterday, then you and the French MUST have also known. The public need to know why you did not act on this intelligence and prevent them leaving😡😡
1308346877436403714 2020-09-22 18:06:18 +0800 <Olgachristie> 🤣🤣🤣
1308343176554582017 2020-09-22 17:51:35 +0800 <Olgachristie> I’m sure he’ll listen to you....not🙄
1308341926345748480 2020-09-22 17:46:37 +0800 <Olgachristie> So Mr CCTC if @Nigel_Farage received information from intelligence sources in France that a very large influx of illegal migrants would arrive today then you MUST have heard too. Which begs the question why have you and the French not stopped them?🤨   https://t.co/ysE1iMIqEr
1308317817213784064 2020-09-22 16:10:49 +0800 <Olgachristie> I’ve heard it all now.....then why did the Tories win an 80 seat majority last December and traditional Labour voters in northern towns voted Tory for the first time🙄
1308300767082639360 2020-09-22 15:03:04 +0800 <Olgachristie> He was right (as with most things)...he never specified from Turkey. His prediction in 2015...  https://t.co/eW2u3urHg0
1308283165891416065 2020-09-22 13:53:08 +0800 <Olgachristie> Nigel Farage said that he has intelligence from sources in Calais that a massive wave of illegal migrants will set sail from French beaches on Tuesday, and questioned whether British or French authorities will ‘lift a finger” to stop the “invasion”.  😡😡  https://t.co/hNdaZWTAtb
1308276544817844230 2020-09-22 13:26:49 +0800 <Olgachristie> On Monday a barracks near Cheriton in Folkestone will be opened up to house 400 people.Charities have expressed concerned it could become a magnet for far-right protests.   But less concerned on the impact of local residents (deemed ‘far right’)😡  https://t.co/Y1Qx4YHIv1
1308275278767099904 2020-09-22 13:21:47 +0800 <Olgachristie> What is the point of that....people will just go out an hour early.  It’s crazy🤔😏
1308271893619724288 2020-09-22 13:08:20 +0800 <Olgachristie> I don’t get it....surely those wanting an evening down the pub will just go an hour earlier🤔🤔
1308270380109438977 2020-09-22 13:02:19 +0800 <Olgachristie> Brilliant speech Mr W👏👏👏👏👏
1308093578342694919 2020-09-22 01:19:46 +0800 <Olgachristie> Returning them will be even cheaper....
1308017870849400832 2020-09-21 20:18:56 +0800 <Olgachristie> Not a particularly well balanced panel is it....where is the white representation?🤔
1308015863245737984 2020-09-21 20:10:58 +0800 <Olgachristie> These barracks should have been made available to our homeless veterans, shameful that illegal migrants take priority😡
1307904775363719168 2020-09-21 12:49:32 +0800 <Olgachristie> 🤣🤣🤣
1307722512567070722 2020-09-21 00:45:17 +0800 <Olgachristie> But rest assured folks illegal migrants crossing the channel will still be housed in 4* hotels🙄
1307684787994464265 2020-09-20 22:15:23 +0800 <Olgachristie> Bet the locals are ecstatic.....
1307658083875934208 2020-09-20 20:29:16 +0800 <Olgachristie> Our homeless veterans should be housed there.....they have fought for our country and now left on the scrapheap😡
1307629163138998284 2020-09-20 18:34:21 +0800 <Olgachristie> YES
1307628780979204098 2020-09-20 18:32:50 +0800 <Olgachristie> You appear to be all talk and no action Mr Clandestine Channel Threat Commander (rather like your boss)...since you took up your new post crossings have increased week on week🤨

1307542633015902214 2020-09-20 12:50:31 +0800 <Olgachristie> Cue Priti Patel saying she is “deeply disappointed”🙄  The judiciary have way too much power.  Something needs to change😡
1307541410493718528 2020-09-20 12:45:39 +0800 <Olgachristie> No 1 in the UK too.....I’m on episode 4...brilliant👏👏

1307539563888422912 2020-09-20 12:38:19 +0800 <Olgachristie> 180 diversity officers employed across 9 Government departments.

Waste of money.   https://t.co/WM1U4mCYNG
1307538554231422978 2020-09-20 12:34:18 +0800 <Olgachristie> Rishi Sunak is trying to persuade Boris Johnson to rip up the 'triple lock' which protects the income of pensioners.

1305030450721828865 2020-09-13 14:28:00 +0800 <Olgachristie> I couldn’t possibly guess🤔🤔
1304996730728050688 2020-09-13 12:14:00 +0800 <Olgachristie> ‘A Home Office spokesman said: 'There is no excuse in any circumstances for harassing those arriving in the UK’  And there you have it.....illegal migrants must not be ‘harassed’.  You couldn’t make it up🙄😡
1304995474664030209 2020-09-13 12:09:01 +0800 <Olgachristie> The government claiming it is not in the “public interest” to  release the report even though almost 19,000 suspected child sexual exploitation victims were identified by local authorities in just one year simply beggars belief😡😡
1304992495982522368 2020-09-13 11:57:11 +0800 <Olgachristie> And returning to the UK in the next available dinghy no doubt.  The burning question is will they slip through the net by our hapless Border Force?🤔🤨
1304990310607589377 2020-09-13 11:48:30 +0800 <Olgachristie> Brilliant if true👏
1304990116650385409 2020-09-13 11:47:44 +0800 <Olgachristie> Keir Starmer does...called him an ‘inspiration’🙄🤨
1304986759760171009 2020-09-13 11:34:23 +0800 <Olgachristie> ‘Britain's Got Talent judge Alesha Dixon has said she will quit the show if ITV apologises over a Black Lives Matter-inspired dance.’  Let’s hope ITV apologise then, she won’t be missed🙄   https://t.co/81kjoUKDuI
1304985794088710150 2020-09-13 11:30:33 +0800 <Olgachristie> ‘Boris Johnson looks set to withdraw from significant European human rights laws in a move which could make it easier to deport migrants and more difficult to sue British soldiers’  👏👏👏👏👏   https://t.co/yCwXX5MPHx
1304877875540168704 2020-09-13 04:21:43 +0800 <Olgachristie> What a disgusting state of affairs that we have people like Steve sleeping under a bridge in desperate need of help, while boatloads of illegals migrants can come and 4* hotel accommodation.😡😡
1304875601023643651 2020-09-13 04:12:41 +0800 <Olgachristie> Are you having a laugh...an ‘inspiration’?🙄 What, for turning our once great capital city into a crime ridden horror story😡
1304678438104686592 2020-09-12 15:09:14 +0800 <Olgachristie> The reality is we all know what’s going on. Not from  mainstream media who eagerly line the dock side waiting for exhausted looking women and children being brought off the boats. We all know the reality from alternative media and independent reporters.    https://t.co/3mns4ubbDr
1304678129751994368 2020-09-12 15:08:00 +0800 <Olgachristie> ‘Over my time on the refugee trail, I’ve noticed that the majority of people making the journey to Europe are males between the age of 18-35. In fact I’d estimate up to 85 per cent of the migrant influx is comprised of young men’  We’ve noticed that🤨  https://t.co/3mns4ubbDr
1304677134565343234 2020-09-12 15:04:03 +0800 <Olgachristie> And he’s absolutely right...
1304640419045748736 2020-09-12 12:38:09 +0800 <Olgachristie> It’s Bunter Boulton lol🤣🤣
1304639590960189440 2020-09-12 12:34:52 +0800 <Olgachristie> Oops this hasn’t aged well has it Mr D?🙄😂
1304637848218460160 2020-09-12 12:27:56 +0800 <Olgachristie> Exactly. We pay the French millions to supposedly prevent them leaving their shores when in fact they are either turning a blind eye or escorting the boats into our waters🤨
1304632772925980677 2020-09-12 12:07:46 +0800 <Olgachristie> Last year Zoe Ball and Claudia Winkleman were the top 2 earning females having been paid up to £375k each.  It is estimated Fiona Bruce’s pay could now top £400k #DefundTheBBC   https://t.co/51n1emGZAu
1304513868622958594 2020-09-12 04:15:17 +0800 <Olgachristie> Stating the bleeding obvious. What has he actually done since he got his job with the ridiculous title...apart from overseeing a record 52 boats cross the channel today?🤔🤨
1304511609713364993 2020-09-12 04:06:19 +0800 <Olgachristie> And another appalling and unacceptable incident which I am sure you have been made aware of is 52 boats crossing the channel today (so far) full of illegal migrants.  The public are fast losing confidence in you and your Border Force.  Enough is enough😡
1304509966288646144 2020-09-12 03:59:47 +0800 <Olgachristie> What, by allowing 52 boat loads of illegals to cross the channel today, including several boats arriving on the coast undetected.  The public have no confidence in you😡
1304471028320665600 2020-09-12 01:25:03 +0800 <Olgachristie> He certainly deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for that alone👏
1304468383023366145 2020-09-12 01:14:33 +0800 <Olgachristie> 52 boats full of illegal migrants arrived in Dover (including several who washed up on beaches undetected).  Our Home Secretary and the head of her Border Force should resign. #NationalEmergency
1304465647775240193 2020-09-12 01:03:40 +0800 <Olgachristie> The European Union has hinted it could ban UK food exports to the bloc if the two sides fail to agree a trade deal by the end of the year.   Then we must reciprocate🤨   https://t.co/q5caEKyYDv
1304464834952650752 2020-09-12 01:00:27 +0800 <Olgachristie> Resign @pritipatel 😡
1304463450488307712 2020-09-12 00:54:57 +0800 <Olgachristie> Well the way things are heading with our historical monuments being desecrated it won’t be long before our British history and culture are eradicated altogether😡

1304394120476188672 2020-09-11 20:19:27 +0800 <Olgachristie> Great, now how about you make a historic moment by returning ALL the illegal migrants currently here in their 4*  hotels back to France and turning back any more attempting to cross🙄
1304392810196537344 2020-09-11 20:14:15 +0800 <Olgachristie> Says she who kept lecturing us that Parliament was sovereign🙄🙄
1304391114389106692 2020-09-11 20:07:30 +0800 <Olgachristie> Just a shame not all illegal migrants respect our traditional British values of respect, tolerance, liberty and safety eh Kevin?  Why don’t you follow the example of that other virtue signalling idiot and offer to house one of them?🙄
1304387918824452096 2020-09-11 19:54:48 +0800 <Olgachristie> There are thousands more like Steve who will be sleeping rough tonight and every night.  They should always be given priority accommodation before the thousands of illegal migrants currently residing in 4* hotels.  It cannot be allowed to continue @pritipatel @BorisJohnson🤨
1304369343128571906 2020-09-11 18:41:00 +0800 <Olgachristie> “The police are very much aware of our concerns and there will continue to be a staff and police presence at the bus stop."  Idiotic decision to house illegal migrants in a hotel near a school, and madness to allow those with Covid out into the community🤨  https://t.co/KMq59FkKND
1304284726136639488 2020-09-11 13:04:45 +0800 <Olgachristie> Good👏
1303996838190755851 2020-09-10 18:00:47 +0800 <Olgachristie> We need one of those Covid Marshalls down at Dover dishing out fines for more than 6 in a dinghy😏
1303996038978703360 2020-09-10 17:57:37 +0800 <Olgachristie> Who might that be?🤔

1303923567768240129 2020-09-10 13:09:38 +0800 <Olgachristie> Reverse the scenario. It would have made headlines around the world.   For weeks.....
1303918094897811456 2020-09-10 12:47:54 +0800 <Olgachristie> Only they haven’t been deported yet....stripped of their citizenship in 2018 and still here.  Why is that @pritipatel ?😡
1303885736748478466 2020-09-10 10:39:19 +0800 <Olgachristie> How about 5 homeless military veterans?😏

1303645130772054017 2020-09-09 18:43:14 +0800 <Olgachristie> And to think they got rid of the brilliant @Nigel_Farage who had a huge audience in favour of David Lammy🙄🤨
1303643261563809792 2020-09-09 18:35:48 +0800 <Olgachristie> Michel Barnier's team made threats to make food exports from GB to N Ireland illegal if the UK did not bow to their trade deal demands.His warning prompted the government to make legal changes to the Withdrawal Agreement.

1303384365888610304 2020-09-09 01:27:03 +0800 <Olgachristie> THE prime suspect in the Birmingham knife rampage was released from jail just five months ago.

1302517921252544512 2020-09-06 16:04:06 +0800 <Olgachristie> Open your eyes and look at the video....he had his back to the police talking to someone.  He had repeatedly called for a peaceful protest.  How did he ‘deserve it’?🤨
1302503988533788672 2020-09-06 15:08:44 +0800 <Olgachristie> You fail to mention that your officers brutally took down and assaulted a veteran who had his back to you and was no threat (plenty of video footage to prove).  Appalling heavy handed policing which must  be investigated.  The public are watching @pritipatel😡
1302473183648509952 2020-09-06 13:06:20 +0800 <Olgachristie> At least he was at home surrounded by those he loved Sue. You take care, hope you have plenty of support xx
1302469667102117888 2020-09-06 12:52:22 +0800 <Olgachristie> So sorry to hear that Sue. xx
1302468021982814208 2020-09-06 12:45:49 +0800 <Olgachristie> Unfortunately for the police video footage confirms he had his back to them talking to another member of the crowd and was tackled from behind.  Disgusting, heavy handed behaviour by the police😡
1302461908637888512 2020-09-06 12:21:32 +0800 <Olgachristie> “This time we won’t blink” the PM’s chief negotiator warns that Britain will not become a ‘client state’ of Brussels on the eve of crunch talks to avoid a No Deal Brexit.  Hold firm David, don’t let us down.   https://t.co/mFZrCtqlQ5
1302341914247692290 2020-09-06 04:24:43 +0800 <Olgachristie> ‘Anti-immigration protesters shouted 'England 'till I die' as they clashed with police in Dover today.’  What all the MSM really mean (but it doesn’t suit their agenda) is ANTI- ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION🤨  https://t.co/YsZdG45VeJ
1302340275084419072 2020-09-06 04:18:12 +0800 <Olgachristie> Working-class women and children were smeared as ‘far-right’ by leftist pro-Refugee groups including Free From Torture, headed by a woman who ignored warnings about Pakistani grooming gangs in her own Government report into child sexual abuse in 2012.  😡  https://t.co/7liN0X5LnG
1302253674413142017 2020-09-05 22:34:05 +0800 <Olgachristie> Disgusting😡😡
1302144881280851970 2020-09-05 15:21:47 +0800 <Olgachristie> “We hope this sentence allows her to move on and shows our commitment to removing dangerous offenders from our streets.”  Jailed for 4 years, out in 2 years😡😡  https://t.co/M7lMVUOw7x
1302143510657880064 2020-09-05 15:16:20 +0800 <Olgachristie> Double their catch from 25% to 50% in waters that belong to us? We voted to regain complete control of our waters, not a 50-50 share😡
1302141668691447808 2020-09-05 15:09:01 +0800 <Olgachristie> Can confirm.
1302115147696103424 2020-09-05 13:23:37 +0800 <Olgachristie> Your desperation and lack of reality is embarrassing🙄
1302111180933214208 2020-09-05 13:07:52 +0800 <Olgachristie> Ah priorities Natalie ....they were more concerned about arresting a reporter who took an abandoned dinghy (told by an immigration officer it was ok for him to do so)🙄
1302109870540324864 2020-09-05 13:02:39 +0800 <Olgachristie> Why don’t the police seize their phones? @pritipatel
1302108583904129024 2020-09-05 12:57:33 +0800 <Olgachristie> ‘LABOUR MP has said that British voters are not welcome in Dover on Saturday ahead of a planned protest by patriots against illegal immigration, but migrant boats are.’  I wonder how the people of Canterbury feel about their MP Rosie Duffield’s comments😡  https://t.co/gV3W5eYlqW
1302104617870921728 2020-09-05 12:41:47 +0800 <Olgachristie> 🤣🤣🤣
1302100596976242688 2020-09-05 12:25:48 +0800 <Olgachristie> Exclusive: BBC tells Gary Lineker and other stars they will not be bound by new social media rules  Why not, what makes them different, they work for the BBC, we pay their ludicrous salaries so why should we have to hear their opinionated, biased views😡  https://t.co/V8jDmPh8PV
1302097685957218309 2020-09-05 12:14:14 +0800 <Olgachristie> ‘The bloc wants to retain access for its fishing boats, but No 10 is adamant that British trawlers will be given priority.’  I can’t believe the EU would be so superior to believe they could still have the same access to our waters post Brexit😡  https://t.co/DOs9rgdXq8
1301929294994829313 2020-09-05 01:05:07 +0800 <Olgachristie> Good👏
1301928955499380739 2020-09-05 01:03:46 +0800 <Olgachristie> You wouldn’t be pleased if swathes of greenbelt were destroyed along with wildlife where you live would you? Ridiculous vanity project😡
1301926574317543424 2020-09-05 00:54:18 +0800 <Olgachristie> Meghan Markle and Prince Harry failed to tell the Queen about their Netflix deal, which could be worth as much as $150million, before announcing it to the world, a royal source has claimed.  The ultimate insult😡  https://t.co/leHBQna363
1301886603510657024 2020-09-04 22:15:28 +0800 <Olgachristie> Currently, the UK retains 25% of fish in its waters, with the rest being caught by European vessels. In the Celtic Sea, British boats are allowed to catch only 10% of the haddock quota, whereas French fishermen take 66%  How is 50% a triumph ?🙄🤨    https://t.co/cUJYBY1lPl
1301856599204655105 2020-09-04 20:16:15 +0800 <Olgachristie> I’ll believe it when I see it......
1301854372666781697 2020-09-04 20:07:24 +0800 <Olgachristie> Perhaps @TrevorCoultMC might like to enlighten you?🤨
1301824099472334848 2020-09-04 18:07:06 +0800 <Olgachristie> 11 people who had already claimed asylum in Spain before claiming it here which are quite legal grounds for deportation back to that country.
1301788716063690753 2020-09-04 15:46:30 +0800 <Olgachristie> I’d rather take lectures from a former British Army lance corporal, Territorial Army officer and police officer who has worked in a number of roles related to border management strategies than a poor apology for a journalist any day🙄😏
1301787525959294977 2020-09-04 15:41:46 +0800 <Olgachristie> People with medical conditions ie asthma are exempt from wearing a mask.  Did you hear the police officer ask him if was exempt?😡
1301743826990583808 2020-09-04 12:48:08 +0800 <Olgachristie> Read the comments Gary?🙄
1301739757781823488 2020-09-04 12:31:58 +0800 <Olgachristie> ‘Brussels wants EU fishing boats to keep current access to UK waters but No10 wants to give UK boats priority.’  What part of Brexit doesn’t Barnier understand....we take back control of OUR waters.😡   https://t.co/e1GFBwuLn2
1301739021446643713 2020-09-04 12:29:02 +0800 <Olgachristie> Many of his own MPs are deeply against the project. Costs have spiralled from the projected £36billion in 2012 to an estimated £106billion now. Chief Executive, Mark Thurston, takes home more than 4 times the Prime Minister with £659,416.  Madness😡   https://t.co/zvjj5Iw7ca
1301618970932412420 2020-09-04 04:32:00 +0800 <Olgachristie> You need to be removing more than a handful.....400 came yesterday🙄
1301540339006742528 2020-09-03 23:19:32 +0800 <Olgachristie> Since he was appointed crossings have soared......maybe a change in job description to Channel Crossings Welcome Commander🙄
1301539603711774722 2020-09-03 23:16:37 +0800 <Olgachristie> Oh really....plenty of video evidence suggests otherwise Mr Channel Threat Commander🙄
1301538116151500805 2020-09-03 23:10:42 +0800 <Olgachristie> Gary Lineker has narrated a new video to thank immigrants for bringing fish and chips to Britain as he welcomed a refugee to live in his £4million Surrey mansion.  Blimey, he’s finally lost the plot😳🤣   https://t.co/WxLvmbNWMf
1301537269820555265 2020-09-03 23:07:21 +0800 <Olgachristie> The EU's chief negotiator said the UK 'will recover the full sovereignty' of its waters as part of its decision to split from Brussels. But he insisted 'speaking about the fish which are inside those waters' is 'another story'.   OUR waters. OUR fish😡   https://t.co/e1GFBwuLn2
1301481228080689152 2020-09-03 19:24:39 +0800 <Olgachristie> Up yours activist lawyers👍👏👏
1301405377221795842 2020-09-03 14:23:15 +0800 <Olgachristie> Isn’t it a great feeling?👏👍😀
1301401732770136064 2020-09-03 14:08:46 +0800 <Olgachristie> Let’s hope he gave you advice on how he successfully dealt with the illegals that attempted to cross into his country because you sure as hell need someone to tell it like it is🙄🤨
1301389758850105346 2020-09-03 13:21:11 +0800 <Olgachristie> They’ll start on the 5* ones next......I hear The Dorchester and The Ritz have plenty of rooms available 🙄😏
1301380669411651584 2020-09-03 12:45:04 +0800 <Olgachristie> Definitely carefully hand picked....his background will be carefully scrutinised...no riff raff for Mr L🙄  https://t.co/S92lTimgm0
1301379489809739779 2020-09-03 12:40:23 +0800 <Olgachristie> Oh definitely, and just wait until his new ‘house guest’ invites his mates around🙄
1301376323915575306 2020-09-03 12:27:48 +0800 <Olgachristie> Gary Lineker has revealed he is inviting a refugee to come and live in his £4 million five-bedroom Surrey mansion. Lineker, the BBC's highest paid employee with a salary of £1.75 million, will welcome a migrant into his home in Barnes.  🙄🙄🙄   https://t.co/WxLvmbNWMf

1301210479004733443 2020-09-03 01:28:48 +0800 <Olgachristie> So sorry Alexandra......been through that heartache myself...time heals but you never forget...they leave paw prints on your heart🐾😢
1301203302462435332 2020-09-03 01:00:17 +0800 <Olgachristie> I prefer to shed my tears for fishing communities around  the country that have seen their livelihoods which have been in their families for generations decimated because of the greed of the EU😡
1301163378694553603 2020-09-02 22:21:38 +0800 <Olgachristie> And I can’t believe you are so out of touch with the people of this country....how do you think they feel when they see illegal migrants put into 4* hotels?🙄🤨    How would you describe them....and don’t say desperate because France is not a third world country🤨
1301155772743798785 2020-09-02 21:51:25 +0800 <Olgachristie> The PM’s response was pathetic.... he said he feels sympathy towards desperate migrants who are putting their children in dinghies to cross the Channel from France’🙄🤨
1301154736306032641 2020-09-02 21:47:18 +0800 <Olgachristie> Shows how out of touch he is with the reality.....the majority of the illegals are young males of fighting age - looking far from ‘desperate’ - happy to know they are bound for 4* hotels😡
1301122808446160898 2020-09-02 19:40:25 +0800 <Olgachristie> ‘Dramatic photographs showed migrants staggering onto a British beach today after a potentially record-breaking number were picked up off the coast with up to 25 boats crossing the English Channel’  Border Force are incompetent and not fit for purpose😡   https://t.co/BXTy9BET5F

1301017909762953216 2020-09-02 12:43:36 +0800 <Olgachristie> “We do understand that the UK wants certain advantages for its own fishermen, for its own fisheries industry but common resources need to be managed together in a sustainable way”  Those ‘common resources’ are OUR waters and WE will manage our own waters🤨  https://t.co/uxmmB9RIjU
1301015919381098496 2020-09-02 12:35:41 +0800 <Olgachristie> Some of them are (see the video of the boat yesterday). Drones can’t detect them all.  And unfortunately they will be staying thanks to the lawyers paid for by us who will make sure they won’t be deported😡
1301009885384105984 2020-09-02 12:11:42 +0800 <Olgachristie> More than 80% of English Channel cod is caught by French boats (yes really)  How the hell did we allow that to happen?😳😡   https://t.co/ybJ6r0ljCE
1301008042855669760 2020-09-02 12:04:23 +0800 <Olgachristie> But it’s not targeted is it....some is given to countries with their own space programmes🙄
1301006598832357376 2020-09-02 11:58:39 +0800 <Olgachristie> What planet are they living on allowing foreign aid to remain untouched, given to  countries richer than us😡 That money is needed at home to rebuild our economy.
1300845116324749313 2020-09-02 01:16:58 +0800 <Olgachristie> 100% yes given HE believes in law and order.
1300839288247119877 2020-09-02 00:53:49 +0800 <Olgachristie> A singing parrot has been wowing visitors at a wildlife park by belting out tunes by popstar Beyonce. Chico, a nine-year-old yellow-crowned amazon parrot, can regularly be seen breaking into song at Lincolnshire Wildlife Park.  Check it out - brilliant😂  https://t.co/36Id4KXmo6
1300808145099517958 2020-09-01 22:50:04 +0800 <Olgachristie> How dare @BorisJohnson and @pritipatel put our safety at risk by our hapless Border Force letting these illegals land on our beaches undetected.  How easy it would be for ISIS terrorists to be amongst them😡

1300675160761135109 2020-09-01 14:01:38 +0800 <Olgachristie> Think so🤨
1300675044109094912 2020-09-01 14:01:10 +0800 <Olgachristie> Obviously, not all ‘groups’ eh?🙄🤨 #NoLevelPlayingField
1300662686733266949 2020-09-01 13:12:04 +0800 <Olgachristie> Ordinary decent people concerned about the rising number of illegal migrants coming here and being housed in 4* hotels classed as ‘far right’.  Shame on you Political Polls😡
