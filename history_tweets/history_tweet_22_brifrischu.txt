1342112420794347521 2020-12-24 22:18:31 +0800 <brifrischu> @analog_a Hah, I have moved to a "skate punk" playlist and this gif works surprisingly well with The Clash ;-)
1342111397682044928 2020-12-24 22:14:27 +0800 <brifrischu> @0x11eaea I could Imagine that this gets to a similar point of "I love you but please go away now". ..
1342041932873297925 2020-12-24 17:38:25 +0800 <brifrischu> Whatever you are doing, whether you are celebrating or not, I hope these next days give you rest and strengths. Maybe unicorns if you into this sort of thing. I am kidding, who is not into unicorns? I mean look at this ‚ú®ü¶Ñ‚ú®
1342039431222587398 2020-12-24 17:28:28 +0800 <brifrischu> This is a shoutout to everyone who woke up with "All I want for Christmas" im their heads and is now passively aggressively singing cheesy Chrismas songs to themselves because it is not going away. I am with you üéµ üßÄüéÑ
1341724311489564673 2020-12-23 20:36:18 +0800 <brifrischu> I am still in my pyjama doing absolitely nothing and having surprisingly little guilt about it. If you need someone doing less than you today to feel better about yourself, üôã I will happily be that person.
1341672595779973120 2020-12-23 17:10:48 +0800 <brifrischu> Am I the best to do this research? Maybe not? I get incredibly red ears when talking about sex. I am shy. I find it uncomfortable. Which is why I am so greatful for people talking to me, for me about it. Don't take that away. We need to stand up as a community. For our community.
1341671975350132737 2020-12-23 17:08:20 +0800 <brifrischu> Why do I want to do this research? Because I think we can learn loads from considering elderly people as people with bodies, with needs and desires. About us, about care, about new forms of intimacy.
1341671362851729408 2020-12-23 17:05:54 +0800 <brifrischu> And I am concerned on a personal level. I want to do research into ageing, intimacy and design and I worry that Inwill not get funding if we make sexuality a taboo topic again. If these large communities decide this is too out there, what does that say about community as a whole?
1341670803620982792 2020-12-23 17:03:41 +0800 <brifrischu> Sure, it's uncomfortable. But we all have the attention span of a fruit fly anyway so if you stumble upon some content that is not for you, deal with it. There are bigger fish to fry and you will forget about it soon enough. It might not help you, but it might be great for others
1341670213788577794 2020-12-23 17:01:20 +0800 <brifrischu> I am concerned because of who we trying to silence. The bodies we rarely see in mainstream media. Marginalised communities who we are telling again and again that there is no place for them. And why?
1341669597007785984 2020-12-23 16:58:53 +0800 <brifrischu> Because, yeah we do not talk about this much in mainstream media, do we. And I get it, it is kind of complicated. And messy. And I am blatantly unaware of how much I even don't know and that is hard. But sticking with it can be really helpful.
1341668923771645953 2020-12-23 16:56:13 +0800 <brifrischu> Some of the people I follow are sex workers or people who make naughty illustrations but the majority are educators. About sex worker rights, trans health, sex with disabilities, etc. I have learned so much through them and I am concerned that I might lose this access.
1341668174807388164 2020-12-23 16:53:14 +0800 <brifrischu> A lot of the people I follow on instragram &amp; tiktok are concerned and so am I. Both platforms are cracking down on sexwork &amp; sexual content. Here are a couple of reasons why I find that problematic. Please follow me into this üê∞‚ö´
1341493815417446401 2020-12-23 05:20:24 +0800 <brifrischu> Look, I know that I am watching too much teenie fantasy, but let's face it if I want the story in which a middle aged TA lives through adventures with a bit of queer subtext of belonging and identity, I will have to write that shit myself.
1341448888474095620 2020-12-23 02:21:52 +0800 <brifrischu> It's been too long since I last played around with colourful yarns just for fun.  https://t.co/aNTmqd9YIW
1339621321257455618 2020-12-18 01:19:46 +0800 <brifrischu> I am starting to feel quite christmassy, putting #zines in envelopes. If you want to be part of this mail run, send me a DM and I'll happily add it to the pile  https://t.co/lw5yiUZBsC
1338499354273918976 2020-12-14 23:01:28 +0800 <brifrischu> @kelliemorrissey It was so much fun to make because of all the wonderful stories that came out of the workshop üôèüñ§
1338208486203723776 2020-12-14 03:45:40 +0800 <brifrischu> @mljuul * me. Don't blame random men for my shortcomings :-)
1338172639756562432 2020-12-14 01:23:14 +0800 <brifrischu> @mljuul I'll try to send them out before Christmas but please do not hold men to that ;-)
1338121987617599490 2020-12-13 22:01:57 +0800 <brifrischu> Look, what I have: the first copy of Don't Blush, a #agesextech zine. 20 pages of joyful, sex-positive ageing. Stories &amp; sketches by @mljuul @kelliemorrissey @DrSharronH @nikkinewhouse @PYurman13 &amp; many more. Made #AcmDis2020. DM or email agexestech@brifrischu.de for a copy  https://t.co/z2hHJhupvu
1337033728116318210 2020-12-10 21:57:36 +0800 <brifrischu> Have a look what my amazing colleagues are doing @ReThiCare ... with a little shoutout to a current project of mine adressing intimancy in care homes.
1337032916887605250 2020-12-10 21:54:22 +0800 <brifrischu> Coined the phrase today that working with academics these days is like herding flees on the herds of cats you normally struggle with, so here you go.
1335948559276011520 2020-12-07 22:05:31 +0800 <brifrischu> 38 when I started using the term last year. Switching between binary gender expressions and feeling useasy about myself all my life. It has helped me so much to have a word for it and I cannot imagine what it even might look like for me to "grow out of it".
1329774357565075457 2020-11-20 21:11:27 +0800 <brifrischu> @arneberger @ala_pax Sounds wonderful. Great to hear the paper is useful.
1329773297341501441 2020-11-20 21:07:14 +0800 <brifrischu> @arneberger @ala_pax Ah yeah, the white wall of care robots. Great analysis thanks.
1329746778296610816 2020-11-20 19:21:52 +0800 <brifrischu> @arneberger @ala_pax Great, this paper is absolutely meant as a conversation starter. Can you share a bit more on the criticism that started the conversation?
1329454990923067394 2020-11-20 00:02:24 +0800 <brifrischu> I really wish twitter would work harder to be like twitter and be less like other platforms. I come here fore specific types of content, interactions etc and I see that stripped away more and more.
1323675706749030405 2020-11-04 01:17:35 +0800 <brifrischu> Ok, loving the fashion on Discovery. Particulalry happy that they brought some knitwear back.
1323364497948581891 2020-11-03 04:40:57 +0800 <brifrischu> @UrbanDebris That is A LOT of blinky buttons though :-)
1323338427601952774 2020-11-03 02:57:22 +0800 <brifrischu> @arneberger I'll keep an eye out for the sofas :-) With the previous series it was so often really weirdly shaped drinking vessels ...
1323338157404934145 2020-11-03 02:56:17 +0800 <brifrischu> Maybe it is the fear of the clumsy. I imagine waving to someone and suddenly I have ordered two dozen pizzas with fried onions and blue cheese ...
1323333845274497025 2020-11-03 02:39:09 +0800 <brifrischu> From an HCI perspective all Star Trek interfaces have been rubbish I think, but the all see through interfaces just drive me bonkers.
1323332778444967944 2020-11-03 02:34:55 +0800 <brifrischu> Catching up with Discovery. While I cannot say much about the story, I am slightly annoyed by the shinyness of it all. Everything is so immaterial, so unstable, so invisible. I think I preferred the hands on futures of previous series.
1321772539329323009 2020-10-29 19:15:05 +0800 <brifrischu> Together with @ala_pax I just presented our design fiction about future robots in care at #NordiCHI2020. If you did not catch it, you can find the paper here  https://t.co/6aL6KPUkYe   Still taking questions! ;-)
1318917611011399680 2020-10-21 22:10:37 +0800 <brifrischu> What a fascinating topic, will try to make it!
1315658247374856192 2020-10-12 22:19:04 +0800 <brifrischu> No matter how often cyber turns up in my TL today, it is not going to be any less funny.
1315548939165339648 2020-10-12 15:04:43 +0800 <brifrischu> Workshops work in small doses and are much more tiring. But I have seen them opened up in a variety of ways, which is great. I also got the impression that collaborations grow more easily at the moment. After all, it is just another online meeting, isn't it?
1315548329514762240 2020-10-12 15:02:18 +0800 <brifrischu> I have been on a couple of online conferences this year. Some thoughts: The bad thing is for me that I really struggle to make time for paper sessions, as all the other tasks continue while I am in the office as normal. The good thing is that workshops still work (kind of)
1314945372113047552 2020-10-10 23:06:21 +0800 <brifrischu> Remember this tweet? @ala_pax and me analysed what bugged us about this ad here  https://t.co/WOJFZDVQsZ in the first of a series of blog posts for @ReThiCare
1313889627321835524 2020-10-08 01:11:12 +0800 <brifrischu> @DiverseAlz I'll be on a train, but I'll try.
1308841951345741824 2020-09-24 02:53:32 +0800 <brifrischu> Playing around making some paper protoypes.   I love that I learned pattern cutting when studying fashion knitwear design. Once you know how to wrap something as odd as the human body, you can make everything.  https://t.co/isDSOrjBI1
1308803524168495104 2020-09-24 00:20:51 +0800 <brifrischu> Just treated myself to these two books and somehow they sum up so much of what is going on in my mind right now...  https://t.co/E1URhoHy1V
1308119495312105474 2020-09-22 03:02:46 +0800 <brifrischu> I am pretty sure this has a back story, but it will not be as good as what I am making up right now.
1307667470161936385 2020-09-20 21:06:34 +0800 <brifrischu> You can find me all over the internet, but my new shiny website is maybe a good place to start:   https://t.co/tmJokQ79YM
1306620524483801092 2020-09-17 23:46:23 +0800 <brifrischu> I got a lot of shit done this week.   My celebration of the fact is only dimished by the feeling that it has not even made a dent in the shit that needs to be done.
1301085714923302914 2020-09-02 17:13:02 +0800 <brifrischu> Building on the naughtyness of my twiddlemuffs, I am making a thing, reflecting on the need and wish for intimacy in old age  https://t.co/qI4Oah3oaa
