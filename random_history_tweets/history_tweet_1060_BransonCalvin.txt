1339334973678120964 2020-12-17 06:21:56 +0800 <BransonCalvin> @senatemajldr We in Kentucky have had enough! You wandered around the state telling us you were with POTUS. The moment he needed your help you turned your back not only on him but all of us in the Commonwealth. Enjoy your last term. You fucking RINO..
1337812663867420673 2020-12-13 01:32:49 +0800 <BransonCalvin> Fuck around fuck around someday you won't be around! SCOTUS is about to get a real lesson..
1334888236628455424 2020-12-04 23:52:11 +0800 <BransonCalvin> Winners never cheat because cheaters never win.
1334886932464230406 2020-12-04 23:47:00 +0800 <BransonCalvin> To the #treasonous poll workers in Georgia, you have 2 choices, come clean "the truth will set you free" or lawyer up hard! You Decide!
1334512832650604545 2020-12-03 23:00:28 +0800 <BransonCalvin> Im starting to think the only one in DC who isn't in the swamp is @realDonaldTrump!
1333889237373030401 2020-12-02 05:42:31 +0800 <BransonCalvin> He hasn't seen any voter fraud because he has not led investigation into it!
