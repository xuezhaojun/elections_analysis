1338143299262156800 2020-12-13 23:26:38 +0800 <floater_ocean> Medical establishments r introducing “racial EQUITY” in patient care.   B4, priority was given from most to least emergent. If nothing is done, JUST WATCH how medical care will be distributed &amp;  ...HOW MANY of 1 group of ppl will have to suffer &amp; die to satisfy this new standard.
1338133951836250113 2020-12-13 22:49:30 +0800 <floater_ocean> @h2oskr96 @CodeMonkeyZ I think they are spotlighting Mrs. Fetterman as a local pop-icon celeb to prime the public &amp; gain crazed SJW fanfare by using her sympathetic immigrant “good guy” rags 2 riches, fairy tale princess story bc they plan2 groom her for an influential &amp; powerful role in government.
1338121714924986370 2020-12-13 22:00:52 +0800 <floater_ocean> @ThyConsigliori A little off topic, but this is the main reason why I’m taking the risk of staying here awhile longer b4 fleeing Pennsylvania entirely.

1336677819523485697 2020-12-09 22:23:21 +0800 <floater_ocean> @disclosetv @Rep_CAJohnson it’s acceptable, encouraged, &amp; incentivized to insult us, hate us, &amp; threaten us.

1336618367814340610 2020-12-09 18:27:06 +0800 <floater_ocean> @ThyConsigliori That’s why we need to use his case to fix this 4 the average man. They been railroaded in system 4 years. Extorted, Kids legally kidnapped, falsely imprisioned, rep, friends &amp; earning capacity lost. Result-suicide. Avg guys don’t have platform, connections, &amp; resources to fight.
1336616231550529536 2020-12-09 18:18:37 +0800 <floater_ocean> @ThyConsigliori @GenFlynn Also depends on the accusation as well. Some false accusations r so extreme, malicious, &amp; nuclear that jurors err on the side of the accuser just 2b “on the safe side” or to not appear to condone the crime of the accused, no matter how damaging the accusation is 2 the accused.
1336614299222085632 2020-12-09 18:10:56 +0800 <floater_ocean> @ThyConsigliori Yes.

1335967558902673410 2020-12-07 23:21:01 +0800 <floater_ocean> @PittsburghPG 🚩This PREDATORY program promotes...  Geoengineering through mental/emotional manipulation (which is high tier professional level child abuse)  RACISM &amp;  THEFT
1335964948766339072 2020-12-07 23:10:39 +0800 <floater_ocean> In summary:  implement DISCRIMINATORY hiring practices of teachers based on SKIN COLOR. Replace discipline with mental/emotional MANIPULATION &amp; INCREASE PROPERTY taxes in order to carry out this dangerous &amp; abusive geoengineering operation.
1335946434038927364 2020-12-07 21:57:05 +0800 <floater_ocean> I noticed a pattern during the week where events appear optimistic &amp; I get hopeful. Then the weekend comes, &amp; current events return to the usual gloomy reality then I return to negative,&amp; blackpilled.  Waiting for this weeks 1st dose of  hopium to perpetuate this unhealthy cycle.

1333866288540766208 2020-12-02 04:11:19 +0800 <floater_ocean> @PittsburghPG The only way to get MSM coverage of the fraud election out to the normies is if the story follows the Anti-Trump narrative. Regardless of Barr, this goes beyond fraud. It was an attack on the American ppl. That’s why NO mainstream ANYTHING has broadcasted any of the hearings.

1333767248142626817 2020-12-01 21:37:46 +0800 <floater_ocean> @SauerJacques Somewhere along the line, govt must have became so powerful that their crimes are now accepted &amp; EXPECTED. It’s sad and that’s probably why their crimes don’t get any attention. Probably bc everyone knows there’s NOTHING we can do about it. 😔
1333765045499670530 2020-12-01 21:29:01 +0800 <floater_ocean> @TRUreporting Sometimes the silence makes my tinfoil hat tingle with faith, but personal experience w these ppl, &amp; a lifetime of only seeing these arrogant cheating, lying, criminal thieves constantly being protected, rewarded, emboldened, &amp; empowered puts any hope &amp; faith right back in check.

The “glitch”, the algorithmic voting machine feature that “glitch-switches” vote numbers from the candidate(s) who were entered into the program to lose, to the favor of the candidate(s) that were entered into the program to win.  Yes. I have. 😁

1326612483424055296 2020-11-12 03:47:17 +0800 <floater_ocean> @anildash Today’s definition of “white supremacist” is anyone white, especially anyone white who opposes their own slaughter.  It is a matter of time before a WISH becomes an action.  This is a threat.  Foolish white Americans think they are immune to our rapidly approaching genocide.
1326611147634733057 2020-11-12 03:41:59 +0800 <floater_ocean> Is “white supremacist” the only way white ppl are described as in journalism?   After reading this article? How are white People (or “supremacists”) the problem? Ppl are willing to dismiss what they see with their own eyes than acknowledge real threats.   https://t.co/IXucWynnT3  https://t.co/KWmNm0GOuk

1326562254947540996 2020-11-12 00:27:42 +0800 <floater_ocean> @SauerJacques @realDonaldTrump Yes. We are. We are being slain one by one. Few and far between.

1325875846150844416 2020-11-10 03:00:09 +0800 <floater_ocean> Similar to USA. Media &amp; Institutions only teach about the transatlantic slave trade, blaming the entire white race rather than just the (((elites))) of the time responsible. They teach nothing of slave history or massacres experienced by white ethnic groups.

1306223133385461761 2020-09-16 21:27:18 +0800 <floater_ocean> This is why I (and many others who are competent and compassionate nurses and aides) will NEVER work in a facility again &amp; thug nurses &amp; aides are becoming the new norm. @realDonaldTrump I hope to see more red tape removal in the nursing field so we can take care of our patients!
1306222221619326976 2020-09-16 21:23:40 +0800 <floater_ocean> of what is horrible about nursing homes and the source of every thing (aside from negligent or abusive criminals on the floors that were hired by them) that delays recovery and/or makes the patient miserable &amp; denies patients the attention &amp; care that they need.
1306221617488461825 2020-09-16 21:21:16 +0800 <floater_ocean> The state tries to make it seem like they are out for the patients best interest when I found that they (and insurance companies, &amp; the admin - all the white collars who never see the patients) who are the ones most guilty
1306220685350572033 2020-09-16 21:17:34 +0800 <floater_ocean> the workload it takes caring for a combo of acutely ill/injured patients with many needs &amp; desired accommodations while consuming the nurses with all the required paperwork (that only nurses are allowed to complete) in order for the facility to comply with all the state regs.
1306220387232026625 2020-09-16 21:16:23 +0800 <floater_ocean> This happened to me in wound care. Praised me one year, cited me the next for doing the same thing. They have a bad rep and many times it’s warranted, but most of the time care is poor because administration don’t want to pay4 the appropriate amount of  help in proportion to
1306218665130569728 2020-09-16 21:09:32 +0800 <floater_ocean> the SAME facility for adhering to the standards they praised or enforced the previous year...each time, creating new citations &amp; adding a new policy (weather its good or bad for the patient) for nursing homes to adhere to just to fine them for following THEIR rules the next year.
1306217531573760000 2020-09-16 21:05:02 +0800 <floater_ocean> Now these commies are citing nursing homes for THIS....”failure to accommodate the needs and preferences of each resident”. I been saying this for years. These tyrants praise something and punish for something (while creating a new policy for it) one year, &amp; the next cite
1306216164545134593 2020-09-16 20:59:36 +0800 <floater_ocean> We ALL knew that a patient getting stuck between a side rail and mattress was 1 in a million chance when the state called for their removal &amp; the chances of falls &amp; numerous other issues were prevalent with their removal....BUT THE STATE SAID. So...
1306215511328468992 2020-09-16 20:57:00 +0800 <floater_ocean> Scoring charts, Assessments,  documentation, fighting with administration &amp; maintenance who adamantly resisted adding rails even though their ABSENCE increased the chance of falls, injuries, staff time in incident reports, &amp; pissing off the patients.
1306211054620422145 2020-09-16 20:39:18 +0800 <floater_ocean> @GavinNewsom @KamalaHarris So is exploitation of everyday occurrences like intentional fires, &amp; fraudulent data used by high level white collar criminals (execs &amp; politicians) to tax (steal) more of our earnings.

Although its hilarious that anyone would publicly display their preference for high taxes, surrendered rights, govt corruption, corporatocracy, violence, &amp; degenerousy, the multitude of Biden signs in SW PA are a legit concern.   Let us NOT underestimate the opponent.
1302939369137991681 2020-09-07 19:58:47 +0800 <floater_ocean> @CorrGov The borough right outside of downtown Pgh where I grew up in was violent, but discreet &amp; confined. It looks like todays culture has emboldened this type of behavior to leak beyond residential boundaries. Hopefully with awareness, will be change. @realDonaldTrump

I’ll do research about this and a few other things I’m interested in learning about  (grammar fraud - the Russel Gould thing, the Hitler - Nazi confusion) when the present crises &amp; news cycles slow down...in the mean time, curious for brief rundowns. 😊

I have ruins of an old dry stone stack semicircle at the top of my hill. I have no clue what it was. Well, Retaining wall, old spring house, no clue....but fun to imagine.

I’m limited on my understanding the history of their involvement in what’s currently happening to us, but I do see a relation just by living here and observing the behaviors.

The diverse politicians &amp; executives must enact more legal &amp; financial subversion policies for whites while street thugs commit violence in public.  It’s 2020. Time to make America exclusively nonwhite.
1301526155376328706 2020-09-03 22:23:11 +0800 <floater_ocean> @SauerJacques thanks for the retweet’s. This, I’m afraid this is one of those things no one will care about until it’s too late. Maybe it already is. I wish I knew wasn’t in on it that would investigate because the employees won’t talk. Communism is here, and it’s strong.
1301524700884074498 2020-09-03 22:17:24 +0800 <floater_ocean> @ScottPresler Tons of Biden signs in the East part of Washington county. I suspect each owner had two and put them on the very edge of each property boundary so you can’t tell if two homes have one or one property has two. I’d be pissed if I was their neighbor.

HIGHMARK is forcing employees in hospitals to sign to censor themselves on social media and other papers to be loyal to cultural replacement &amp; quiet about this forced “BOLD” program.

I’m sure there was a time before television, we had politicians were strong men who liked money and power but not enough to open their buttholes for every cent.

1301254421108662286 2020-09-03 04:23:24 +0800 <floater_ocean> Watching old news briefs from 1980-1990.

1301185431590055937 2020-09-02 23:49:16 +0800 <floater_ocean> @AxeTruthNation 🤔 - when one group of ppl based on a skin color is prioritized, celebrated &amp; promoted by corporations &amp; all media, has academic &amp; professional leveraging policies &amp; laws to shield from possibility of hurt feelings, has political organizations, holidays, tv channels, pageants?
1301151935991611393 2020-09-02 21:36:10 +0800 <floater_ocean> @SamParkerSenate That’s not saying much. Half hate the USA and half profit by the corruption that is contributing to the fall of the USA.
1301151566175576064 2020-09-02 21:34:42 +0800 <floater_ocean> @SamParkerSenate Could any info attached to signing be used against me like they do with campaign donations?
1301132417206497280 2020-09-02 20:18:36 +0800 <floater_ocean> So our guy wants to make the police (like all other professions a black majority). GREAT 4 areas where white can’t perform duties without getting killed or accused of racism, but what happens if this institution of authority becomes another antiwhite org?  https://t.co/MjwNQRt8MH

1300908609715531776 2020-09-02 05:29:16 +0800 <floater_ocean> @CorrGov @Shem_Infinite @nytimes This is abuse of aging adults that don’t know how to work a computer, has zero exposure to reality. No alternative media journalism or live-streams that broadcast truth &amp; managed to escape tech &amp; corporate censorship. Seniors that have theIt TVs set on the news 24/7.

1300871345388085248 2020-09-02 03:01:12 +0800 <floater_ocean> @dcexaminer If “race war” meaning ambush &amp; batter a lone whitey, then cry &amp; lie about being provoked by a “deeply hurtful” racial slur...   then her announcement is oh,  ⏰  40+ years late.   We BEEN in a discreet case x case race war. Most whites don’t realize it until it happens to them.

1300766634651648000 2020-09-01 20:05:07 +0800 <floater_ocean> The 3rd world vision the globalists have for the West playing out on the first day of school in France. Could this be why administrators &amp; teachers are opposed to surveillance cameras inside public schools?
