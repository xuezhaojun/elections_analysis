1340747399040536576 2020-12-21 03:54:24 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @saraannhart It’s $6 every other week so not like I’m making it rain.  I’ll told her I’ll bump it to 7 on her bday.  It’s not contingent on doing ordinary household stuff, just learning to manage the money and how things have value blah blah blah
1340740658789756938 2020-12-21 03:27:37 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @saraannhart Oh, so spending money in a wallet, savings in the piggy, and tithing in a separate bank that she then stuffs in an envelope &amp; gives to my friend who gives it to @KearneyCenter
1340740339678801920 2020-12-21 03:26:21 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @saraannhart Piggy bank that she adores dumping out and counting over and over again (nice time suck lol).  when covid is over, she can get the full bank lobby/account experience
1340738472928272387 2020-12-21 03:18:56 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @saraannhart she gets an allowance &amp; I make her do a 40/40/20 spend/save/tithe.  So she sees the power of saving and likes getting thank you letters from donating lol

1327726197036421128 2020-11-15 05:32:47 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @victoriiaaahh you know those folks aint from Leon
1327712980402917379 2020-11-15 04:40:16 +0800 <kungfumaggi> So you admit covid is a deadly problem that’s reduced by social distancing and that contact tracing works?
1327689128922783745 2020-11-15 03:05:30 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @hamiltonnolan Thanks for documenting this, stay safe &lt;3
1327688403144609801 2020-11-15 03:02:37 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @photoriphy @SelfTUPhoto it’s an evocative photo that resonates with this parent of a first grade zoomer
1327687124062248960 2020-11-15 02:57:32 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @VoteJackPorter takes office on Monday &amp; my heart is filled with pride &lt;3 #tallahassee #ihearttally #goodtrouble #allofus
1327643580245155841 2020-11-15 00:04:30 +0800 <kungfumaggi> My first grader is also resisting and protesting in her own ways
1327397343356981250 2020-11-14 07:46:03 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @BKelnhofer @JimRosicaFL @CallTallahassee @TDOnline I’m tired of state sanctioned violence against people
1327346090266529792 2020-11-14 04:22:23 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @JimRosicaFL @CallTallahassee @TDOnline Thought it horrifying enough to be its own item, but I see it in the section about Rs emboldened!

1327341305580707840 2020-11-14 04:03:22 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @JimRosicaFL @CallTallahassee @TDOnline What about the potential awful upping of stand your ground and anti-1a leg?
1327340505693360128 2020-11-14 04:00:12 +0800 <kungfumaggi> I want to be like her when I grow up
1327318508393422850 2020-11-14 02:32:47 +0800 <kungfumaggi> Again?  We never shut down properly to begin with.  Acting like shutting down for two weeks in March did fucking anything is stupid
1327300770560151554 2020-11-14 01:22:18 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @GeoRebekah I told the kids the only way we’d survive this is if we practice radical acceptance of each other
1327288940416610307 2020-11-14 00:35:17 +0800 <kungfumaggi> dude should really just delete his social media, it’s been really bad, and this is @JohnDaileyTLH ’s “chief” of “staff” #tallahassee

1327262301288796160 2020-11-13 22:49:26 +0800 <kungfumaggi> #tallahassee mystery: who is @RealBillyBucket?? Because I heard on reddit it was @Seat3TLH
1327255514892394497 2020-11-13 22:22:28 +0800 <kungfumaggi> Can you imagine getting shot to death because some FloridaMan thinks you were lifting from Walmart?
1327236760682848256 2020-11-13 21:07:57 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @TDOnline When you’re connected, they’ll keep your dirty secrets
1327205222872199170 2020-11-13 19:02:38 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @PlannerMonet Did you screen shot it? This guy has terrible habits
1327023737917599746 2020-11-13 07:01:28 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @Juliane_Seattle Yes it’s true and it’s getting worse
1326975237389430790 2020-11-13 03:48:45 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @rebekahentralgo @theotherdevin @JadaEWilliams the $300k for this is coming from DHS - we are essentially being used as a carport by DHS to deploy this “regionally”
1326925714680147969 2020-11-13 00:31:58 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @Korean_Fir_Tree People have been trying to find ways like this, but it’s private property about to be developed by private companies but incorporated into #tallahassee ’s urban services area
1326918704647516160 2020-11-13 00:04:06 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @Korean_Fir_Tree They approved it the other day, yes, it’s a done deal.  Activists have been working hard on it, two groups were able to get some accommodations made, but it was a messy, backwards, never to be replicated again process that sets a precedent &amp; will cost MILLIONS in untold expenses
1326892808779730950 2020-11-12 22:21:12 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @Korean_Fir_Tree #Welaunee plantation is what the area was called way back, but what they’re doing is creating a suburb with all new roads, infrastructure, town centers, etc while absolutely neglecting current critical areas of #tallahassee and no, I doubt there will be any such remembrance
1326883345138114560 2020-11-12 21:43:36 +0800 <kungfumaggi> Good morning #tallahassee, breathe, drink water, and tell someone you love them
1326859818066468872 2020-11-12 20:10:07 +0800 <kungfumaggi> #Tallahassee #welaunee this is systemic racism in action
1326713026968424448 2020-11-12 10:26:49 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @feacher_miles Get an MSW. Easy track, endless opportunities
1326578332910182400 2020-11-12 01:31:35 +0800 <kungfumaggi> Along these lines- to criticize the police, i don’t have to do fucking ridealongs and eat ice cream with them
1326535524551593986 2020-11-11 22:41:29 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @FrostedMeats @TDOnline tap dancing around the criticisms and plowing straight ahead damned be the consequences for the rest of us.  Watching a train wreck in slow motion is upsetting #tallahassee #welaunee
1326533100336275458 2020-11-11 22:31:51 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @FrostedMeats @TDOnline and proctor...  That was my takeaway as well
1326518196086640641 2020-11-11 21:32:38 +0800 <kungfumaggi> I’m sorry we have a day like #veteransday - I’m sorry we put people in harm’s way and then fail to adequately care for them upon return
1326490690180833280 2020-11-11 19:43:20 +0800 <kungfumaggi> #Tallahassee... where developer lives matter.  10/12 commissioners all acknowledged how flawed process was &amp; it should never be repeated yet they still voted yes. Everyone who spoke in support will gain financially #welaunee Exhausted capitulation is NOT enthusiastic support
1326488210793492480 2020-11-11 19:33:29 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @Seat3TLH Listening to everyone acknowledge how bad all of it was and how it should never be repeated yet still press forward was incredibly disappointing. Every one who spoke in “support” stands to gain financially #tallahassee #lameduck
1326251390931529729 2020-11-11 03:52:26 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @Seat3TLH His answers didn’t make me feel better - a DHS-issued peopledozer and doubleguns.... #tallahassee #defundthepolice doesn’t look like this for sure @tallycac  https://t.co/osZqnaNorK
1326143354531442688 2020-11-10 20:43:08 +0800 <kungfumaggi> My daughter started sucking her thumb again and idgaf
1326126204458557441 2020-11-10 19:35:00 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @TheBestCaptainK @TallyPD Not just new ones to replace old ones - TWO new ones for each so they have “back up” guns on their person
1325553806277550081 2020-11-09 05:40:29 +0800 <kungfumaggi> Before the pandemic, I was supposed to vacation in #philadelphia and was bummed to cancel plans, not realizing how life was about to be cancelled.  I can’t wait to go there once this is over and here’s where I’ll be sure to visit
1325534371902853123 2020-11-09 04:23:16 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @photoriphy @TheOGWeezy @TDOnline I counted... 46 😏

1325408177404452864 2020-11-08 20:01:49 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @sadgloopyrice I’ve had a similar recurring dream
1325281665967681536 2020-11-08 11:39:06 +0800 <kungfumaggi> That’s my #president
1325228443106209792 2020-11-08 08:07:37 +0800 <kungfumaggi> Feeling this joy from #florida - we’re working on the suppression, I promise!
1325228006772764674 2020-11-08 08:05:53 +0800 <kungfumaggi> I can’t wait to fly one again! I’ve been so ashamed

1325223438718562305 2020-11-08 07:47:43 +0800 <kungfumaggi> What Dejoy did was criminal, but how our @USPS #postalworkers acted was noble and worthy of sooooo much praise, tip your mail-person tomorrow!  Buy more stamps!  #tallahassee
1325218276234956800 2020-11-08 07:27:13 +0800 <kungfumaggi> I can’t get enough of these
1325157114449334275 2020-11-08 03:24:10 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @JimRosicaFL I can’t hear him over all the honking and clapping and celebrating and cheers and church bells like we just exorcised a demon
1325156652136411137 2020-11-08 03:22:20 +0800 <kungfumaggi> Does @realDonaldTrump know yet?
1325148378225905664 2020-11-08 02:49:28 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @ChantelleABC27 maybe they’ll get their zoomies out so they’ll sleep tonight?
1325147847658885123 2020-11-08 02:47:21 +0800 <kungfumaggi> What’s crazy is they don’t realize how much their own lives will improve

1325137889034964993 2020-11-08 02:07:47 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @TDOnline Or is it? Wtf clickbait is this? It’s over
1325137347198017537 2020-11-08 02:05:38 +0800 <kungfumaggi> If you’re alone rn and wish you could celebrate... turn it up real loud and jump up and down, it feels really good

1325050348067840001 2020-11-07 20:19:55 +0800 <kungfumaggi> On a Friday night, some of the best and brightest of #tallahassee got together to learn how @CityofTLH &amp; @LeonCounty work and how students can get involved….@VoteJackPorter @feacher_miles @adnermarcelin  https://t.co/gupva2ziCq

1324784811576315905 2020-11-07 02:44:47 +0800 <kungfumaggi> Three new commissioners will be seated a week later and the final adoption should be delayed until they are seated so the voters can be heard
1324764533932609536 2020-11-07 01:24:12 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @TDOnline Not only do they want new guns, they want TWO new guns for each officer to have as back up #tallahassee #blacklivesmatter  https://t.co/obot3OmLlV

1317282677305888768 2020-10-17 09:53:58 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @BlueprintIA2020 @LeonCounty All I see is $30 million poof gone promised to FSU for a white elephant convention center #tallahassee  https://t.co/XkhrhAzDON
1317281982401990656 2020-10-17 09:51:13 +0800 <kungfumaggi> Feeling seen by my local government on this fun Friday evening
1317245155985022976 2020-10-17 07:24:53 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @TDOnline 125/126 public comments were in favor of delaying this development and most in favor of incorporating Keep It Rural’s recommendations.  The comms say they’re listening to the people, but man come on, which people?
1317202131208851459 2020-10-17 04:33:55 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @mcyost I like Amy covid Barrett

1316797449479114752 2020-10-16 01:45:51 +0800 <kungfumaggi> Omg why does the worst never occur to me?  Oh yeah, I’m not evil.  I wonder which local police forces would love to be tapped for this…
1316777953754329088 2020-10-16 00:28:23 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @MonicaCaseyNews @WCTV They work hard for their kickbacks that’s for sure.  If they worked half as hard at advocating for anything truly meaningful, we might see some progression
1316775689203392516 2020-10-16 00:19:23 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @feacher_miles Do u miss them or miss who you wish they were?

1316486918507581440 2020-10-15 05:11:55 +0800 <kungfumaggi> Omg the state attorney said he’d drop the charges of #tally19 if they attend “diversion program” of @CityofTLH Race Relations Propaganda Summit!  Wow

1316468555827892225 2020-10-15 03:58:57 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @Seat3TLH @TallyPD Please see public input is taken and incorporated into the creation of this audit; there’s so much global and local expertise to be called upon to reduce police violence!

1314741570441281536 2020-10-10 09:36:31 +0800 <kungfumaggi> 1860 Census indicated that in central @LeonCounty, which was the center both of the #Florida slave trade &amp; of the plantation industry, slaves constituted 73% of the population. As elsewhere, their value was greater than all the land of the county. Have a plantation wedding today!

1314591301493456897 2020-10-09 23:39:24 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @TDOnline Does that mean he recognizes his installation was controversial, his first six months a bloodbath, and that he’ll be stepping down?  That’s would be some nice healing.

1306231014310719490 2020-09-16 21:58:37 +0800 <kungfumaggi> Authorities bulldozed the bodies of 674 Black victims into a mass grave in West Palm Beach. The mass grave was not marked and the site was later sold for private industrial use -- first used as a garbage dump, then a slaughterhouse, and then a sewage treatment plant.

Doubt it!
1303883853640200192 2020-09-10 10:31:50 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @HanleyWill Like cops are gonna say one is shit? What about everyone else saying NO to this ugh
1303881144111431680 2020-09-10 10:21:04 +0800 <kungfumaggi> 9 hour meeting for those of in the public comment portion and it had a satisfying ending
1303880928993964032 2020-09-10 10:20:13 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @KarlEtters Such an easy and good thing to do. I’m tired of having to push so hard. Grateful they came back around to it @DianneWCox @CurtisBRich @elainebryanttlh @JohnDaileyTLH
1303869088092033025 2020-09-10 09:33:09 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @HatterLynn @AbiJack53463902 @Seat3TLH made the motion and no one seconded it. I’m so ashamed

1303863311058993153 2020-09-10 09:10:12 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @KarlEtters As if cops won’t back each other up 🙄not a biased poll at all

1303842264335163392 2020-09-10 07:46:34 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @WaltMcNeil_ just said he doesn’t know what the protestors want and wonders if they’re just doing it for attention. heartbroken I voted for you #Tallahassee @tallycac
1303841665250189313 2020-09-10 07:44:11 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @KarlEtters @JohnDaileyTLH @WaltMcNeil_ am I to believe all this information was not made available to our city leaders?
1303841159064805376 2020-09-10 07:42:11 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @KarlEtters @JohnDaileyTLH just called the noon presser incendiary?? Also LE didn’t brief our city leaders?? Am I to believe that
1303839866480984065 2020-09-10 07:37:02 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @KarlEtters Omg I can’t take the narrative anymore
1303812618512203776 2020-09-10 05:48:46 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @KarlEtters Does he have business with One Plant?

1303782043181088771 2020-09-10 03:47:16 +0800 <kungfumaggi> There’s no good reason for a victim’s family to have to beg like this for an ounce of compassion from @CityofTLH #tallahassee #BlackLivesMatter

1303367873126166530 2020-09-09 00:21:31 +0800 <kungfumaggi> I have the stack of 300+ public comments they ignored in June re: police reform. They chuckled and called them form letters. Prepare to feel really angry tomorrow when they do it again, but we have to make this record! #tallahassee #BlackLivesMatter
1303366566214610944 2020-09-09 00:16:19 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @tallycac followers- I welcome all questions, comments, dms about how to shake up our city leaders #Tallahassee #blacklivesmatter
1303363945554685954 2020-09-09 00:05:54 +0800 <kungfumaggi> I just wrote a @theactionnet letter: SEND EMAIL: Drop The Charges Against the #Tally14 BLM Protesters. Write one here:  https://t.co/9gh6EeJMKj

1303322313786568705 2020-09-08 21:20:28 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @DavidsonHiers If only there was a group of people who could enforce mandates... like maybe some sort of enforcement agency.... hmmm but they seem busy dragging people off sidewalks rn
1303321836592214017 2020-09-08 21:18:35 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @Jason_DAmours @Seat3TLH At least he had one to give, that in itself is a show of strength rn imo
1303309759630761985 2020-09-08 20:30:35 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @tallycac, citizens: yes! our city has set it up to ignore us. We have to play their game until their rules break them. If they want comments, submit thousands. If they take phone calls, jam their system. We will be heard!  #Tallahassee #BlackLivesMatter
1303305457684148225 2020-09-08 20:13:30 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @WCTV @JohnDaileyTLH failed to respond to request for comment....

1303017274320842756 2020-09-08 01:08:21 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @AnthonySabatini @JimRosicaFL Stay there then
1302989441389211648 2020-09-07 23:17:45 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @Hahadaisy1 @tallycac @TallyPD @CityofTLH The first couple of meetings the relief in their face was palpable. They’ve been summarizing written comments in the most shallow possible way. They truly don’t seem to know how upset people are rn @CityofTLH
1302988097156771843 2020-09-07 23:12:25 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @Hahadaisy1 @tallycac @TallyPD My bad, not zoom for us. It’s a zoom call between the comms that we watch. It’s televised on @CityofTLH channel and streamed on their website
1302983140533850115 2020-09-07 22:52:43 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @Hahadaisy1 @tallycac @TallyPD Conveniently for them it’s zoom. You can submit written comments or sign up for a phone call. We have to play their games until it’s open again
1302982521794236416 2020-09-07 22:50:16 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @Hahadaisy1 Babies still need borne and people still need help coping with death. Natural disasters will still happen. Life is dramatic enough without the pressures of capitalism
1302978610039590912 2020-09-07 22:34:43 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @Hahadaisy1 People would still need forms of help &amp; you would provide it somehow I’m sure

First they killed her. Then they killed her reputation in #tallahassee They’ll do it to us too if we get in the way

1302659819984375808 2020-09-07 01:27:57 +0800 <kungfumaggi> Wholeheartedly agree and overwhelmingly grateful to see leadership advocating for our youth @tallycac #Tallahassee #blacklivesmatter

Criticizing how one protests&amp;defending the police state...that’s a choice that won’t age well imo

1302364724806463489 2020-09-06 05:55:21 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @HatterLynn @wakullawriter Following everything closely! Thank you!
1302364272329195521 2020-09-06 05:53:33 +0800 <kungfumaggi> Protesting in TLH is a time honored tradition.  We have plaques &amp; monuments to them.  I was brought here as a high schooler to participate, "assigned" protests to in college, I've studied them &amp; have much, much to learn.  I know this: this is not the way @CityofTLH @TallyPD

1302360776234151948 2020-09-06 05:39:40 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @wakullawriter @foswi @flmolly @MayorOfTLH @thomaswhitley If this weren’t 2020 that wouldn’t be a long time ago, it’s evidence city manager and police chief promoted rumors

1302352097955000331 2020-09-06 05:05:11 +0800 <kungfumaggi> it's happening literally rn in #tallahassee just had protesters targeted, now being arrested but also criticized for wanting lawyers in advance?  like these kids are walking into the bait
1302351672052789248 2020-09-06 05:03:29 +0800 <kungfumaggi> seriously what barney fife shit is this?  what does the post it on his forehead mean? do his tattoos have meaning?  is this a real cop?

1302348696319909891 2020-09-06 04:51:40 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @HatterLynn it's almost as if... the police are counterprotesting....  how about not be the people with weapons at the event protesting you have so many weapons?
1302348218127310848 2020-09-06 04:49:46 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @foswi @flmolly they got that together awful quickly, too quickly. @tallypd shouldn't be the response when they're who's being protested
1302347839503294466 2020-09-06 04:48:16 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @wakullawriter @foswi @flmolly @MayorOfTLH @thomaswhitley I feel this is where moderates and middle aged people like me can bridge the gap and fire up the youth and then aim that fire like a laser... they need leadership asap

1302325051639947269 2020-09-06 03:17:42 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @TDOnline The point of it was to serve a narrative; the families are collateral #tallahassee

1301914947308355584 2020-09-05 00:08:06 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @WCTV Cool so no curfew until then? @LeonCounty

1301584826584248320 2020-09-04 02:16:19 +0800 <kungfumaggi> So true. Like when Reese Goad and TALCOR spread the rumors of busloads of agitators coming earlier this summer and made NE freak out

1301213016994832384 2020-09-03 01:38:53 +0800 <kungfumaggi> "The Sheriff has requested the curfew for several reasons &amp;not just the protest.  The Commission felt it would be in the best interest to heed his advice &amp;it was also for other underlying issues." @MaryAnnLindley @LeonCounty This needs to be made more clear then @tallycac
1301207465409863685 2020-09-03 01:16:49 +0800 <kungfumaggi> @saraannhart School is kinda recent invention too, outgrowth of modernization/industrial growth.  Kids used to just be worked until they died of cholera or whatever

Black on black violence is caused by the very same systemic violence and racism as police violence.  It's just a different expression of black lives failing to matter in our society.  @kjhang10 @thewebguy
