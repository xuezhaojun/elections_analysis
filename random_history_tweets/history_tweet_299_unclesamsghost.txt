1333940680176054272 2020-12-02 09:06:56 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @LLinWood It's all over but the sedition and treason.
1333940173990731776 2020-12-02 09:04:55 +0800 <unclesamsghost> What the actual hell is with these people?
1333939052316405763 2020-12-02 09:00:28 +0800 <unclesamsghost> I do have one question though...where was all this outrage from Republicans when it was Democrats weathering these storms? Where was your support of decency then?
1333939051389476864 2020-12-02 09:00:27 +0800 <unclesamsghost> I also take note of all of the Republicans saying how "appalling" it is that there are death threats and ugliness directed at these people and I agree with that sentiment. They're right, it's unconscionable, it's un American, and it shouldn't be tolerated.
1333939050458255367 2020-12-02 09:00:27 +0800 <unclesamsghost> I genuinely appreciate and also feel for the Republicans out there who are doing their jobs and certifying elections in their states because we all know what kind of storm they're having to endure from the cult.

1321074431880474624 2020-10-27 21:01:03 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @RadicalScriptur @owillis Historically, US politics swings on a pendulum, left to right.

1317621909383712769 2020-10-18 08:21:58 +0800 <unclesamsghost> I hope they can find things that give them hope in the platform and look to the future when we can heal the nation and move forward with our shared goals.
1317621908477743104 2020-10-18 08:21:57 +0800 <unclesamsghost> We got our asses kicked. I think Bush won 40 states. It was brutal, but I've never regretted that vote because it was an informed vote, and I chose the platform that I felt would help people and be good for the country. I hope that's how people who aren't fans of Biden feel now.
1317621907567611905 2020-10-18 08:21:57 +0800 <unclesamsghost> That said, I've always liked Biden and this isn't a hard vote for me to cast. I remember the first Presidential election I voted in - 1988. I couldn't tolerate Dukakis, but his opponent was Bush, Sr. I remembered what my Dad told me and voted for the platform.
1317621906577698817 2020-10-18 08:21:57 +0800 <unclesamsghost> Just thinking about my Dad who passed in March. He always said "if you can't stand the candidates, look at the platforms and use that to inform your vote, but always vote". Joe Biden isn't my first choice but I think he's a decent man and I support the Democratic platform.

1311945622795309056 2020-10-02 16:26:25 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @eugenegu @LikelyBen I work in healthcare, I still daily talk to people who say it‚Äôs a ‚Äúhoax‚Äù. That‚Äôs his handiwork.  I‚Äôve lost people and had friends hospitalized. My empathy is not limitless. I wish it was. I don‚Äôt want him to die. That‚Äôs all I got.
1311944357495418880 2020-10-02 16:21:24 +0800 <unclesamsghost> I know some people will say that it‚Äôs awfully convenient that he‚Äôs been diagnosed now and that‚Äôs true. But it‚Äôs not really relevant. We have to keep pushing hard with the truth and get it out there and not get distracted by his Covid result.
1311944355872206849 2020-10-02 16:21:23 +0800 <unclesamsghost> We need to avoid getting distracted by his positive Covid results. He has the best medical team anywhere and they will do everything they can for him. We need to get back to the fact that we are in the middle of an election and the truth is coming out.
1311944353686921216 2020-10-02 16:21:23 +0800 <unclesamsghost> I do not wish anyone harm. However, I have limited sympathy for people who ignore medical advice, are reckless,  and who don‚Äôt care about other people. And that‚Äôs what all this masking and all this handwashing has been about. Being part of a community and caring about others.

1305298627863162880 2020-09-14 08:13:38 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @DonaldJTrumpJr ‚ÄúObama is the head of infidelity and killing him will automatically make Biden take over the presidency for the remainder of the term.

1303806608967958535 2020-09-10 05:24:53 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @realDonaldTrump 21. He promised to lock up Hillary Clinton for using a private email server. He didn‚Äôt. He uses his personal cellphone for official business, and several members of his own administration, including Jared Kushner and Ivanka, have used private email in the White House.
1303806338582147088 2020-09-10 05:23:49 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @realDonaldTrump 18. He promised to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. His Justice Department is trying to repeal the Entire ACA, including protections for people with pre-existing conditions. 19. He said Mexico would pay for his border wall. It‚Äôs cost Americans $11 billion.
1303805837715148800 2020-09-10 05:21:49 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @realDonaldTrump 17. He said he‚Äôd drain the swamp. He‚Äôs brought in more CEOs, and Wall Street moguls than any administration in history,he‚Äôs filled departments and agencies with former lobbyists, lawyers, and consultants who are crafting policy for the same industries they used to work for.
1303804610361122823 2020-09-10 05:16:57 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @realDonaldTrump 16. He promised to help American workers during the pandemic.80 percent of the tax benefits in the coronavirus stimulus package have gone to millionaires and billionaires. At least 21 million Americans have lost extra benefits, with no new stimulus check to fall back on
1303804278440632320 2020-09-10 05:15:38 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @realDonaldTrump 15. He promised to revive the struggling coal industry and bring back lost coal mining jobs. The coal industry has continued to lose jobs as clean energy becomes cheaper.
1303804151558795265 2020-09-10 05:15:07 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @realDonaldTrump 14. He promised to bring down the price of prescription drugs and said drug companies are ‚Äúgetting away with murder.‚Äù They still are. Drug prices have soared, and a company that got federal funds to develop a drug to treat coronavirus is charging $3,000 a pop.
1303803988534591491 2020-09-10 05:14:29 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @realDonaldTrump 13.

1303803925464788992 2020-09-10 05:14:13 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @realDonaldTrump 12. He promised to eliminate the federal deficit. He has increased the federal deficit by more than 60 percent.
1303803624896823303 2020-09-10 05:13:02 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @realDonaldTrump 11. He said hydroxychloroquine protects against coronavirus. No way. The FDA revoked its emergency authorization due to the drug‚Äôs potentially lethal side effects.
1303803328082718727 2020-09-10 05:11:51 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @realDonaldTrump 10. He promised that anyone who wants a test for COVID will get one. But countless Americans still can‚Äôt get a test.
1303803058883878913 2020-09-10 05:10:47 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @realDonaldTrump 9. He promised that the average American family would see a $4,000 pay raise because of his tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. But nothing trickled down. Wages for most Americans have barely kept up with inflation.
1303802811973599232 2020-09-10 05:09:48 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @realDonaldTrump 8. He promised to be ‚Äúthe voice‚Äù of American workers. He hasn‚Äôt. His administration has stripped workers of their rights, repealed overtime protections, rolled back workplace safety rules, and turned a blind eye to employers who steal their workers‚Äô wages.
1303802584436822016 2020-09-10 05:08:54 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @realDonaldTrump 7. He said he wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúcut Social Security like every other Republican and I‚Äôm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.‚Äù His latest budget includes billions in cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
1303802321453936644 2020-09-10 05:07:51 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @realDonaldTrump 6. He said he would boost economic growth by 4 percent a year. Nope. The economy stalled, and unemployment has soared to the highest levels since the Great Depression. Just over half of working-age Americans are employed‚Äîthe worst ratio in 70 years.
1303802166956765184 2020-09-10 05:07:14 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @realDonaldTrump 5. He said corporations would use their tax cuts to invest in American workers. They didn‚Äôt. Corporations spent more of their tax savings buying back shares of their own stock than increasing workers‚Äô wages.
1303801986236788736 2020-09-10 05:06:31 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @realDonaldTrump 4. He said he‚Äôd cut your taxes, and that the super-rich like him would pay more. He did the opposite. By 2027, the richest 1 percent will have received 83 percent of the Trump tax cut and the richest 0.1 percent, 60 percent of it. More than half of all Americans will pay more.
1303801617674842118 2020-09-10 05:05:03 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @realDonaldTrump 3. He said he would repeal the ACA, and replace it with something ‚Äúbeautiful.‚Äù Instead, seven million Americans have lost their health insurance since he took office. He has asked the SC  to strike down the law in the middle of a global pandemic with no plan to replace it.
1303801266682896391 2020-09-10 05:03:40 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @realDonaldTrump 2. He said he won‚Äôt have time to play golf if elected president. He has made more than 250 visits to his golf clubs since he took office‚Äîa record for any president‚Äîincluding more trips during the pandemic than meetings with Dr. Fauci. Expense to America? More than $136 million
1303800825026879488 2020-09-10 05:01:54 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @realDonaldTrump 1. He said coronavirus would ‚Äúgo away without a vaccine.‚Äù You bought it. But it didn‚Äôt. While other countries got the pandemic under control and avoided large numbers of fatalities, the virus has killed more than 170,000 Americans, and that number is still climbing.

1300972913022185472 2020-09-02 09:44:48 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @WWoodUK @kaitlancollins To be fair, if he refused to be evaluated for a mini stroke it can‚Äôt be diagnosed for certain. I‚Äôm beginning to think he refused tests like a CT to diagnose it. I also think this would give his MD cover to deny it.
1300972216482435072 2020-09-02 09:42:01 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @daft_editor @kaitlancollins My mom has had mini strokes. She had probably six or seven of them before it became obvious. How could they possibly know that he hasn‚Äôt had any if they have not evaluated him for it?
1300971796397727745 2020-09-02 09:40:21 +0800 <unclesamsghost> @kaitlancollins I find it especially interesting that he said ‚Äúhas not been evaluated for ‚Äú. How would you know if someone had a mini stroke or a silent stroke if you didn‚Äôt evaluate them for it?
