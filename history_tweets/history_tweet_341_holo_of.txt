1342339285219852288 2020-12-25 13:19:59 +0800 <holo_of> One thing I left out is that on their "compute" page (below) despite not being live yet they seem to have many users?  I was wondering how if they are in pre-sale.  Its because they are intentionally obfuscating their current Mining operations with #Cudos compute page.  https://t.co/t7A7AvlwIv
1342337063165722625 2020-12-25 13:11:09 +0800 <holo_of> But with the plot twist of gaining new cryptocurrency miners for them while they sit around waiting for a compute job. üòÇ  #CUDOS to their business plan though because if compute fails (it will), mining still wins. üòÄ
1342337060904919041 2020-12-25 13:11:09 +0800 <holo_of> To finish this up,although it is unique &amp; I have to give them credit for their research on #Holochain to create their whitepaper üòâ   This is just another #Blockchain company trying to be something it isn't suited for which is #cloudcomputing.
1342337058220646403 2020-12-25 13:11:08 +0800 <holo_of> The reason for this is like most #Blockchains there needs to be delegates, validators, stakers, voting, yada yada.  #HoloHosting is not complex, there is one internal currency (#HoloFuel) which is used for paying for hosting services, that's it, no blockchain baggage.  https://t.co/VOUkOgNFr4
1342337051681701889 2020-12-25 13:11:07 +0800 <holo_of> But with #Holochain  you are not awarded jobs by Holo the hosting company the developer or client will chose their hosts, which is why self-hosting is possible.   But with #Cudos it comes down to how rich you are (staked).   Their payments is very convoluted also see image below.  https://t.co/UCdLuE2Alh

There is no server side attacks or down time possible because #Holochain is Serverless.   #Cudos method of delegating jobs is based of course on staking.

And the app rules may see this person blacklisted as a bad node or some other punitive measures depending on the creators terms.   The bottom line is though that a person offline or online cannot spend what they do not have &amp; will be caught near instantly.

1335843306933121024 2020-12-07 15:07:17 +0800 <holo_of> of each chain and the #DHT for your application knows you know longer have those funds as you just spent them at XXX store.   So when you scanned the barcode to pay, even while still offline, the receiver would not be able to process this transaction &amp; would be alerted.    If
1335843304064237568 2020-12-07 15:07:17 +0800 <holo_of> would be an additional entry on the agent‚Äôs chain for that application. So if you tried to use the same app at the business next door after having just spent all the money you had, the previous transaction would have already been "Gossiped" to random peers who validate the sate
1335843301086306310 2020-12-07 15:07:16 +0800 <holo_of> With these rules as the foundation, each user keeps an immutable record of their own actions on a local hash-chain, DNA being the first entry on the chain. Each tweet, vote on a poll, or currency transaction (depending on the hApp)
1335843297995067392 2020-12-07 15:07:15 +0800 <holo_of> But if it was somehow the same #Application, lets say a banking or remittance app, the ‚Äúbiological constraints‚Äù of each app is  encoded in its validation rules‚Äîthe DNA of the application. These rules are the only things nodes in a hApp need to maintain global consensus.
1335843294715150338 2020-12-07 15:07:14 +0800 <holo_of> you cannot have spent it if you were offline.  But what if I went to the retailer next door &amp; tried to make the same transaction (Double Spend)?    Assuming it is the same #Holochain #application being used (If it wasn't your last transaction means nothing to a different app)
1335843291590393857 2020-12-07 15:07:14 +0800 <holo_of> transaction is now complete, the next time you are online you will see your balance has been adjusted &amp; your payment now reflects that.   How did the app know you have the money?  Because it is randomly broadcast to other peers in an encrypted form the state of the hash table
1335843288356556800 2020-12-07 15:07:13 +0800 <holo_of> In that scenario the retailer who is online depending on the app, you have scanned the barcode, &amp; clicked "Pay".  The retailers side of the app debits your account after gossiping to random others about this transaction, &amp; you have signed a header offline to approve it, the
1335843284636221445 2020-12-07 15:07:12 +0800 <holo_of> peers who validate it. Validators gossip to share good data, warn against bad data, and blacklist bad actors.  So all this is taking place during your offline retail payment &amp; the good thing is you don't need to go back online to finalize it as is the case with many like #Square.  https://t.co/WWEbgWymq1
1335843277577146372 2020-12-07 15:07:10 +0800 <holo_of> validation rules &amp; agents have their own local, tamper-resistant hash-chains recording their actions, built upon hApp rules. Each hash-chain entry is cryptographically signed (multi-party actions, like transactions, are mutually countersigned) &amp; then data is shared to random
1335843274423033857 2020-12-07 15:07:10 +0800 <holo_of> also very minute, if that makes sense.  Holochain maintains data integrity without the need for global consensus.  It uses an agent-centric approach, combining ideas from BitTorrent and Git, along with cryptographic signatures, peer validation, and gossip.  All Apps have
1335843271814172674 2020-12-07 15:07:09 +0800 <holo_of> tested on that front.  But getting back to offline payments, the reason I mentioned consensus is because if a bank or retailer decided to build an offline capable application on #Holochain they would know that it is safe to use because the security of the consensus is so high yet
1335843268790108161 2020-12-07 15:07:08 +0800 <holo_of> methods.

That's an area where I think #Dfinity is getting a little ahead of itself, it's the same 2017 hype that #Blockchain had back then.

1316231572618579969 2020-10-14 12:17:15 +0800 <holo_of> But in comparison #Holochain versions of smart contracts will be applications which will have unlimited scaling.   They are also using #WASM which #Holochain also has &amp;  #Rust.  And just like most projects they have manufactured or magnified a "selling point" issue that they
1316231569422516224 2020-10-14 12:17:15 +0800 <holo_of> But #Dfinity is #Blockchain so it comes with all of the blockchain baggage which means complications of tokens, staking, time lockups, voting etc.   Dfinity uses canisters which are #smartcontracts that are able to scale. They will no doubt be a lot better than the current #ETH
1316231566218067972 2020-10-14 12:17:14 +0800 <holo_of> architecture is also complex &amp; difficult for many to understand.   But the big difference is with Holo hosting you simply obtain Holofuel then set &amp; forget &amp; either pay for  hosting or simply earn it.
1316231562707394561 2020-10-14 12:17:13 +0800 <holo_of> They also have an insane staking lock up period that involves the slow dilution of tokens before you can get your funds, from a minimum dissolve delay of 6 months up to 8 years.  With that said the criticism about complexity I also need to point out that the #Holochain  https://t.co/BFmReDnYoU
1316231554234949632 2020-10-14 12:17:11 +0800 <holo_of> #Dfinity has neurons, voting power, proof of stake, Governance tokens, fiduciary subnets, data subnets, system subnets, sending cycles &amp; so on.   Do they really think the general public developers are going to want to get their heads around that?
1316231551076556800 2020-10-14 12:17:10 +0800 <holo_of> What data center is going to want to contribute to its own demise?  Their entire ecosystem is token based, yes Holo has Holofuel so it is also cryptocurrency based, but it seems cleaner to me to have a currency that pays for hosting that's it.
1316231547972796416 2020-10-14 12:17:10 +0800 <holo_of> remuneration.  Basically what it comes down to is the #Dfinity cloud is just rented servers from centralized companies paid for by Dfinity in their tokens.   The other thing is they also claim they want to eventually replace data centers with their new internet.
1316231544701284352 2020-10-14 12:17:09 +0800 <holo_of> to agree to this? The other problem they have in their business model is they are expecting the data centers to be paid in tokens.  They may find a few but I'm pretty sure that a data center is not going to entirely agree with a token that is subject to high volatility as being
1316231541517807617 2020-10-14 12:17:08 +0800 <holo_of> platform then guess who is left holding the bag?  Its the data centers themselves or Dfinity as the paying client of the data centers.   So there is either a centralized way to remove unlawful content or their isn't &amp; if there isn't do you think the data centers are going to want
1316231538208509952 2020-10-14 12:17:07 +0800 <holo_of> they can be identified &amp; removed as the external hosts would be able to comply with law enforcement.   But with #Dfinity there is no "person" to be identified as Dfinity themselves are paying for the data centers &amp; if someone uploads unlawful content to this "unstoppable"
1316231534924369920 2020-10-14 12:17:06 +0800 <holo_of> there is a big difference in the two.   Open source #Holochain allows anyone to build &amp; either host with Holo hosting or find their own.   So if a person uploads unlawful content on Holo hosting they can be identified.  If they do so using Holochain &amp; use external hosting
1316231531652767745 2020-10-14 12:17:06 +0800 <holo_of> As you can see from the image above Dfinity uses data centers for its cloud.  Unlike #Holochain which does not.  The name they have bestowed upon themselves is "The Internet computer" a subtle marketing ploy.  They also state that it is unstoppable.   Holochain is the same but
1316231527903051777 2020-10-14 12:17:05 +0800 <holo_of> There are a lot of #Blockchain projects that like to call themselves a #cloud  provider but they are just re-selling cloud services from big #cloud companies &amp; attaching a blockchain to it.

Remittance services &amp; banks don't ship the physical money, its all done digitally.    A remittance or banking hApp on #Holochain would work the same way with zero tx fees.

You can even act as your own ISP and provide internet to others who don't have a connection.    This is also why Holochain is ideal for #IOT  https://t.co/IGbMVl100L
1312188235192258565 2020-10-03 08:30:29 +0800 <holo_of> The next 2 or 3 years will be interesting for #Blockchain as more projects like Radix &amp; other new technology starts to take some of the market share away from traditional blockchain relics.
1312188231341940737 2020-10-03 08:30:28 +0800 <holo_of> tokenomics of Radix are weighed heavily on the previous ICO investors &amp; with so many projects pivoting to be the #Defi king it could end up being an ugly race.   Overall though imo #RadixDLT  is a good project with a solid team &amp; its definitely a step up from regular #Blockchain.
1312188226254172160 2020-10-03 08:30:27 +0800 <holo_of> into their application thereby exposing many App users to Holofuel.   The other big difference is that as I said earlier  #RadixDLT  is focused on being the "#Defi solution", whereas #Holochain is the solution for all #dApps of any kind, #Defi or not.   In summary I think the
1312188222278041601 2020-10-03 08:30:26 +0800 <holo_of> #Holochain can run without any need to interact with any tokens, #cryptocurrency or staking at all.

1312188213323165696 2020-10-03 08:30:23 +0800 <holo_of> I see it as an advanced #smartcontract platform but I also think smart contracts will eventually be replaced entirely by applications.   Probably the best way to point out the differences to #Holochain would be;   #RadixDLT engine is for the creation of #dApps which is
1312188208126464000 2020-10-03 08:30:22 +0800 <holo_of> good reason for that. üòâ  Radix still carries some of the constraints of blockchain like staking nodes, delegates, locked tokens &amp; a failure if 1/3 of nodes go down.   #Holochain has no such constraints.  https://t.co/1YQmg7D9PG

1304229278867808256 2020-09-11 09:24:26 +0800 <holo_of> That's the thing about #Cryptocurrency, if ppl own it they need others to buy it to realize profits.    Everyone is a salesperson in perpetuity, its all about on-boarding new money.    https://t.co/ST5neOnlh4
1303881253687496704 2020-09-10 10:21:30 +0800 <holo_of> Holochain #Cloudcomputing is the worlds first distributed decentralized cloud.  It is the Airbnb of Web Hosting.    #Holochain #Snowden #P2P
1302474530095472642 2020-09-06 13:11:41 +0800 <holo_of> @TrineSeven @Ripple How much time are you willing to put aside for "talking"?  It's been a few years now, how many more months or years are you willing to watch them spend your money on trying to buy adoption?
1302473642542952449 2020-09-06 13:08:09 +0800 <holo_of> of the #Crypto markets because the cost of #Cloudcomputing is not pegged to #Bitcoin.  #Holochain with #Holofuel will be the first digital currency that has an actual revenue which is asset backed.   This current pain is not in vein because the future is Holochain.üòé
1302473640726781952 2020-09-06 13:08:09 +0800 <holo_of> We can all see the market dropping massively.   This is because of sentiment but more so because none of these #Cryptocurrencies have an actual revenue or income.  They rely on whales, exchanges &amp; miners to set the pace.   #Cloudcomputing won't be subject to the same volatility
1302426220982755328 2020-09-06 09:59:43 +0800 <holo_of> A "3 year bear market"?   That's one way of looking at it. üòÇ  Another way would be to say that there is no revenue for #XRP &amp; #Ripple constantly dumps its tokens to spend hundreds of millions of üí∞ in failed attempts to try &amp; buy adoption.   How long will this bear mkt last?
1302423614512226305 2020-09-06 09:49:22 +0800 <holo_of> Can't help but notice that Binance has avoided calling its #Blockchain an actual blockchain. üòÇ
1302422768428830721 2020-09-06 09:46:00 +0800 <holo_of> As I said a few hours before this happened #Defi is just a gimmick.  No rules no regulation ppl are always going to get scammed, that's crypto.   #Blockchain self harms itself every time.   It relies on greed &amp; fomo 24/7.
1302207734209675270 2020-09-05 19:31:32 +0800 <holo_of> @ProtonDrive Look at putting it onto #Holochain Proton, they are very privacy minded &amp; will be far more cheaper &amp; more secure.    https://t.co/v5MAaURXS3
1302207034452893697 2020-09-05 19:28:45 +0800 <holo_of> there is no actual revenue or real world adoption of #Cryptocurrencies &amp; they will clutch at anything that might bring in some üí∞.  #Defi sounds catchy, but don't be caught out.
1302195658116325376 2020-09-05 18:43:33 +0800 <holo_of> @tristanxevrs @Ripple üòÖ  Ripple cult members: There is huge demand for Ripple  Narrator: There has never been any actual demand.
1302115171435864065 2020-09-05 13:23:43 +0800 <holo_of> Can you name a current #Cryptocurrency that is asset backed and has an actual external revenue?
1302111672740397057 2020-09-05 13:09:49 +0800 <holo_of> @AdamScochran Unless it is forked to make it malicious which happens at times.   #Holochain is open source but has a license to protect end users privacy &amp; data integrity, best of both worlds. üòâ   https://t.co/76BMg7WVQc
1302052877645488129 2020-09-05 09:16:11 +0800 <holo_of> @Ripple Ripple still stomping their feet with tears in their eyes saying "We created this to be used, we demand you use it".  This is the result of a flawed business model which saw a product created without first having market demand.   Fail.
1301131386548445184 2020-09-02 20:14:31 +0800 <holo_of> The name is "Forbes Crypto" but they are excited to be in the "#Blockchain universe".  Change your name to Forbes Blockchain.
1301130765577547776 2020-09-02 20:12:03 +0800 <holo_of> Consider #Holochain when live.  It doesn't have congestion, it doesn't have volatile fees.
1300619625600675841 2020-09-01 10:20:57 +0800 <holo_of> #Holochain uses peer validation, gossip &amp; cryptographic signatures for security.
1300619022552031232 2020-09-01 10:18:33 +0800 <holo_of> Gas fees are at all time highs is a good thing? üòÑ  No gas fees on #Holochain currencies, free to send &amp; recieve, no miners to pay.
