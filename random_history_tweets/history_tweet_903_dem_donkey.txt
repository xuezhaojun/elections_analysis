1337144823673987074 2020-12-11 05:19:03 +0800 <dem_donkey> What the FUCK is happening to our country??   How can this coup actually be happening? Because that is exactly what is happening here - he is staging a coup and now 106 R's who are SUPPORTING this?   WHAT THE FUCK???  I am angry, depressed, frustrated, &amp; in complete disbelief.

The sad thing is that I am finding is that I don't like most of what I've learned. We are a corrupt society. I just can't tell if it's gotten worse or I just see what I didn't before.

All in all, I'm sure you have figured out that I'm a Biden supporter, but I do truly believe that he won the election. I think people are tired of T's games and lies.

1333794742115549188 2020-12-01 23:27:01 +0800 <dem_donkey> @Cernovich Trump is the most hated, most divisive president we have ever had. You have to remember that the Democratic party is bigger than the R party, and independents largely voted for Biden. Even a lot of R's voted for Biden. It's really not a surprise.

1333621025607704578 2020-12-01 11:56:44 +0800 <dem_donkey> @realDonaldTrump Oh, just get over yourself. You LOST.

1333211378677649408 2020-11-30 08:48:57 +0800 <dem_donkey> @realDonaldTrump Yeah, he did. People turned out in DROVES to vote against you. People who have never voted before registered to vote. When even the courts are against you - your own appointed judges - you know you have lost BIGLY.  Suck it, Loser!
1333210878670462976 2020-11-30 08:46:57 +0800 <dem_donkey> @susankey_key Sounds just like something Donald Trump would say - to a 16 year old.

1331681838482460676 2020-11-26 03:31:06 +0800 <dem_donkey> @realDonaldTrump Really? Given your history of pathologically lying, I don't believe you for one second.   https://t.co/D0qDAuEVO7

1331459357037441024 2020-11-25 12:47:02 +0800 <dem_donkey> @DFiore7 @Lrihendry Except there isn't. They have lost every single major court case that they filed. Even the republicans are tired of Trump's bullshit and lies, even his own judges. There is no evidence of voter fraud, and they know it. They are just sowing chaos &amp; confusion - Trump's M.O.
1331456968184238086 2020-11-25 12:37:33 +0800 <dem_donkey> @Lrihendry Bullshit. Besides, it doesn't matter. No offense to the people of Arizona, but President-elect Biden doesn't need Arizona to win - which he already has. It's too late to change things now. Suck it up, Buttercup; your boy lost.

It's ok - they will figure it out. And if we can flip those Georgia senate seats, it's not going to make any difference.

It is all about President Biden and his cabinet nominations. He has chosen people who are experienced &amp; who are not corrupt - imagine that! The people voted, the people have spoken, &amp; they voted you out.

You may not say the words out loud, but you have to concede because you LOST, &amp; you know it. If the GSA announcement today doesn't matter, then why did you block EM for 3 weeks from letting Biden start the transition process.

You have no "case" and there is nothing to continue. You have failed as president, and your asinine attempts to overturn the election are embarrassing.

1319856242047811585 2020-10-24 12:20:24 +0800 <dem_donkey> @emeraald13 @SEGreenhalgh Yep. Brian Kemp was the Secretary of State who oversaw his own gubernatorial race, and there were a lot of issues with the election: voter roll purges; holds placed on voter registration applications; polling site changes and closings; and other voting-related issues. #CorruptGOP

My husband's signature took 3 days to verify which I was glad to see. They take their time to make sure it matches.   The best part? We have 5/5 Biden supporters in my family!

My mother says she has a friend who is no longer speaking to her b/c she is voting for Trump &amp; they have nothing to talk about until the election is over. Just curious if this is the case for you.

He was married at the time!" Maybe it only matters if the woman is married b/c he might get shot by her husband? It certainly isn't b/c he believes in the sanctity of marriage.

He is pretty well hated here in CO, is down by 9 points, and Hick did a good job as mayor &amp; Governor.  According to FiveThirtyEight, Kelly leads McSally in AZ's special election by 17 points. She has little chance of winning her appointed seat back.

President Obama was not president then - YOU were. Suspicious that you are just now sending $ to them 3 years later when you need Hispanic votes. SMDH.

1307037851570372609 2020-09-19 03:24:42 +0800 <dem_donkey> Trump suddenly sending aid to PR? Votes. Hurricane Maria was 3 years ago, &amp; it's just a bit fishy that just when he needs (Hispanic) votes the most, he is finally sending money. "We've done more for PR than anyone."

1300782457755705346 2020-09-01 21:07:59 +0800 <dem_donkey> @TiffanyATrump Ewww...you enjoy attention from the nastiest person in the House? Desperate and gross!
1300781889498873859 2020-09-01 21:05:44 +0800 <dem_donkey> @TiffanyATrump Oh, Tiffany...and all this time I thought you were the smart one. Apparently I was wrong. Very wrong. So sad!
1300640901098860546 2020-09-01 11:45:30 +0800 <dem_donkey> @tostig_alvin @bestgsquared @ModerateBetsy Ok...I know this isn't the point of your tweet, but I just have to say wow, Brad Pitt was a very handsome young man.  Whew, it's üòì in here! Lol  And yes, I agree 100% on the no railing decision...
1300614317553922050 2020-09-01 09:59:52 +0800 <dem_donkey> @kimguilfoyle I am SHOCKED that you would stoop so low as to date someone in the Trump crime family. Guess you must be a money grabbing grifter just like they are.
1300608486473166850 2020-09-01 09:36:41 +0800 <dem_donkey> @kimguilfoyle You‚Äôre just a mean, ugly, nasty person. Must be the Trump influence.
