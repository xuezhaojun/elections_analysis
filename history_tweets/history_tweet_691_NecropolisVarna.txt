If we just got rid of the Fed it wouldn't cost a thing to give the people money. The $ would be backed by the productive capacity of the U.S. which is huge.

1339943279836733443 2020-12-18 22:39:07 +0800 <NecropolisVarna> @BasilissaAnna Religion is only 1 part of a culture. A Muslim in Indonesia has a different culture than a Muslim in Bosnia. Culture is down stream of genetics, imo.
1339941548428042242 2020-12-18 22:32:14 +0800 <NecropolisVarna> @BasilissaAnna This is also why multi-cultural democracy can't work. You can't expect people who culturally and genetically are not suited to democracy participating in a democracy with people who are so suited.

1338310150885666816 2020-12-14 10:29:39 +0800 <NecropolisVarna> Brown anoles were introduced onto the continent and  aggressively usurped the green anole’s ground level territory. The beautiful aloof emerald colored green anole responded with “green flight,” taking to living high in the branches of trees, away from the coarse and rowdy browns
