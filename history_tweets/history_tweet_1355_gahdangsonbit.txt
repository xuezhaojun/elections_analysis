You could not have withstood a single day of the unfair barrage of hate that the #Leftists, the #DeepStateCabal, and the #RINOS unleashed on President Trump for over four years. His legacy is good, thanks. #AmericaFirst

However, the NEW spirit of the rule will not be passive. The ruled-over, including the useful idiots, will get it good and hard.

1323306613567033347 2020-11-03 00:50:57 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> I'm delighted President Trump is not "presidential" in the sense that corrupt Bush-Clinton-Bush II-Obama admins might have been. Knowing the extent of corruption in US politics, &amp; knowing the abuse of the USA by other countries, I'd be far less presidential than Trump has been!

I've listened to you, too, &amp; realized that you were mostly nutty, but occasionally you'd make a good point. But you are not worth the nuttiness. Unfollowing.
1317652378317967361 2020-10-18 10:23:02 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @JoeBiden But @JoeBiden, did you look #HunterBiden in the eye and discuss the dignity of pimping him and your other family members for your "paycheck"? I don't think everything is going to be OK, Pop. By the way, #WheresHunter anyway? No respect.
1317640916090355713 2020-10-18 09:37:29 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @GovWhitmer #PresidentTrump is right, you know. #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica and must be defeated. #Freedom
1317588222483042304 2020-10-18 06:08:06 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> Just say "Commie." Lah.  Howbow dah?
1316935420547129349 2020-10-16 10:54:06 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> #CrookedJoeBiden said tonight, abt packing SC ct: “The people do have the right to know where I stand, and (unintelligible) have the right to know where I stand before they vote.” That after saying SC appointment is wrong bec. people are already voting!
1316830662150610944 2020-10-16 03:57:50 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @RealJamesWoods This election may be the last time we have the opportunity to save our country in a peaceful manner. Yes, promote #CrookedJoeBiden, but let's remember the greater goal to elect #Trump2020 and down-ballot anti-socialists. All #Democrats must be defeated.
1316182327190458368 2020-10-14 09:01:34 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @ScottPresler @RSBNetwork Scott, great job on RSBNetwork at tonight’s Peaceful Protest for #PresidentTrump!
1316165101024542720 2020-10-14 07:53:07 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> President Trump just cited Alfred E. Neuman as superior to #Democrats. That’s true. They are MAD!
1316158760457433090 2020-10-14 07:27:56 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> Please find the Trump Peaceful Protest on YouTube by Right Side Broadcasting! Right Now! #RightSideBroadcasting Thank you @RSBNetwork !
1315796820333785088 2020-10-13 07:29:42 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @StacyHerndon10 America must never become a socialist nation.
1315785742094790656 2020-10-13 06:45:41 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @RealJamesWoods @mensamule The #Democrats have realized and embraced the ignorance, ahistoricality, and willful self-deceit of the sheep and useful idiots devoted to the destruction of America as founded. #DemocratsTheEnemyWithin

1315088181906165760 2020-10-11 08:33:50 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @MYKIDSEZMOM @RobbersonJon Maybe "Barri’Quisha"?
1315072615938097152 2020-10-11 07:31:59 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @WayneDupreeShow #BuildTheWall as symbolic of everything else needed to #SaveAmerica.
1315069882648522753 2020-10-11 07:21:07 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @SamBerger_DC Packing a court means legislatively ADDING SEATS and filling those seats with sympathetic judges. But you know that, don't you? Orwell and Rand wrote about people such as @SamBerger_DC. Changing the meaning of words to obfuscate. Damn #DemocratsAreADisgrace.
1314633481696145408 2020-10-10 02:27:01 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @Cernovich I'm close to retirement. Is that "elderly"? Wife and I are voting, in person, for #TRUMP2020ToSaveAmerica!
1314271610187116544 2020-10-09 02:29:04 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> Hello @joerogan. Please invite @JamesOKeefeIII to join you on your show.  I'm glad that you are interested in his Minnesota voter fraud story.   @Project_Veritas has a great record of exposing wrong doing. And he wins his defamation lawsuits. How about it?
1313259063828979714 2020-10-06 07:25:34 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @JoeyCawbs I’m confident that the H-bomb deserves jail.
1311136788631687168 2020-09-30 10:52:24 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @TrumpJew Frankly, Biden’s performance was better than I had expected. Lies and promises are easy to make.
1311096274012299264 2020-09-30 08:11:25 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @ForcedAdoption1 Wonderful! “Debate” to begin in about 45 minutes. Will you view?
1310355541034754049 2020-09-28 07:08:00 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @TheRalphRetort Paying the lowest tax legally allowable. That's something else that I have in common with President Trump! Who knew?! #MAGA2020  (Who do you know that pays more tax than is legally required? Not #Democrats I'd wager.)
1309534938899906562 2020-09-26 00:47:14 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @McAdooGordon @ChatChristi Professional liability insurance usually excludes coverage for prior acts, fraud, and malicious acts. These crooks have wasted money on insurance. Maybe they need attorneys, instead!
1308544201714434048 2020-09-23 07:10:23 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> Dear President @realDonaldTrump:  Please acknowledge @RSBNetwork for their great job of covering your Peaceful Protests. They do a great job and Show Your Crowds!  They are based in Auburn, Alabama, along with the @mises Institute ( https://t.co/sHm9j50VER). War Eagle!
1307871483419656194 2020-09-21 10:37:15 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @TimRunsHisMouth I’m a Trumplican. Love America as founded. Consider myself patriotic. My great-grandfather was a PFC in Georgia’s Confederate army. Your argument is not my favorite.
1307473892500557826 2020-09-20 08:17:22 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @ScottFishman If Sleepy Joe were a car, he’d be Chinese-made. Maybe a Great Wall Oro.   https://t.co/brNqwZt4vK
1306763043834130432 2020-09-18 09:12:42 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> President Trump is at a rally in Wisconsin. #MAGA Watch on Right Side  https://t.co/Ijf8ntrGul
1305922407555837959 2020-09-16 01:32:19 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> I saw my first Biden lawn signs today. They were in a very expensive enclave near Emory U. in Atlanta. But there are none in my middle-class neighborhood. The #Democrat / #Democratic Party is now the party of the rich. #Trump2020
1304511445300846594 2020-09-12 04:05:39 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @judymorris3 I'm reminded of Edward C. Banfield's essay on "Rioting Mainly for Fun and Profit."  https://t.co/2bpRpqt8NQ
1303496867595137024 2020-09-09 08:54:05 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @MarkSteynOnline Rush is the GOAT, but I’m happiest when @MarkSteynOnline is his guest host! Thank you, Mark!
1303073180072935424 2020-09-08 04:50:30 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @JoeBiden The real minimum wage is always $0.00. That’s the wage when you aren’t worth the artificial, government fiat “minimum wage.” Cruel thing to do to low-skilled job seekers, @JoeBiden.
1302320262361227264 2020-09-06 02:58:41 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump Yes. But Critical Race Theory is only part of pernicious Critical Theory, which calls for relentless criticism, grousing, and complaining about the established order, while promoting tolerance &amp; celebration of anything that weakens it.
1302066803909120001 2020-09-05 10:11:31 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @jason_howerton Juvenile black rat snake. Non-venomous. Harmless. Farmer’s friend.
1300979038396112897 2020-09-02 10:09:08 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @NickAdamsinUSA Nancy Pelosi: coiffed hypocrite.
1300609632302440449 2020-09-01 09:41:15 +0800 <gahdangsonbit> @NewYorker @MerrillLynch I despise wealthy corporations spending their investors’ capital on social and political causes. It is dangerous to #Liberty itself.
