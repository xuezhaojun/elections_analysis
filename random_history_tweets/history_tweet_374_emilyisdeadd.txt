1338050080042053633 2020-12-13 17:16:13 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Sometimes it feels like I live in a poorly written comedy.

1338046522223681538 2020-12-13 17:02:05 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I think some people literally think because they made a child that's all that is required in the parenting department. People really check out on their kids and expect them to grow up into fully functional adults. That's a joke if I ever heard one.

1338045512960921601 2020-12-13 16:58:04 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> It's just so frustrating bc she really thought my insurance was gonna magically go down from $400+ to $100+???? Like how? I'm not getting paid yet and I'm not on disability yet.

1337482372762267651 2020-12-12 03:40:21 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I used to do a lot in the gym but especially squats because I was good at them üòí in hind sight someone with scoliosis shouldn't be doing squats, especially more than one or two. But no one considered that I was disabled and so I was pressured to break my body.
1337482371835318279 2020-12-12 03:40:21 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Makes me wonder how much I may have fucked over my body in the gym all those years ago because everyone around me had convinced me something was wrong with my body. And that I had to change it for them in order to be loved and accepted on any level.
1337482371109621762 2020-12-12 03:40:21 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Thinking about how squating for a couple minutes not even to search for something in my room hurt my pelvis and hips so bad.

1337274432226725891 2020-12-11 13:54:04 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> That being said I love him and he has changed a great deal over the years. He also isn't in a position of power given the fact he is a working class disabled white man who is also a burn victim. That still doesn't mean he isn't violent and a deeply problematic man.
1337274431362785280 2020-12-11 13:54:04 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I have experience with domestic violence. My father has expressed to me in detail how he wanted to murder my mother with a hammer. This is not okay. She's a horrible person but he still should have kept that to himself or a therapist. I will not be able to look at him the same.
1337274430339346432 2020-12-11 13:54:04 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Also most people aren't in postions of power like Johnny Depp.
1337274429441781761 2020-12-11 13:54:03 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> There is a difference between violent thoughts and day dreaming about murdering your ex (I'm guilty of this too, multiple exes) and actually putting it into writing and sharing that with someone who can share it with the public.

1336586443490258945 2020-12-09 16:20:15 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Enjoy my goofy thread ü•∞üëΩ
1336586282487717888 2020-12-09 16:19:36 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> These stories range from funny, unbelievable to disturbing. In my life time it will be mainstream. I'll be here to break it all down with you üòÑ‚ù§üëΩüõ∏
1336586281393008641 2020-12-09 16:19:36 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> People and animals wake up pregnant despite being gay, not sexually active, infertile, and in the case of the dogs: neutered or spayed. Sometimes the baby disappears before it is born. People report meeting their children or their twin on crafts.
1336586280348626944 2020-12-09 16:19:36 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> [cw: gore]  Some of the worst stories I have heard invovle a man waking up with his eyes removed (they still haven't figured out why on earth they would do something so evil, what's the scientific or practical use for human eye balls?)
1336586279346184196 2020-12-09 16:19:36 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Some have been said to take DNA and tissue samples (not just from humans but other animals, mostly mammals). Others it's blood or sex cells (sperm and eggs). Some people have been sexually assaulted or even physically abused when abducted. Some people have memories, others don't.
1336586278360522752 2020-12-09 16:19:35 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> The theory goes we basically traded technology (weapons of war &amp; possibly communicating / spying stuff) for them to have a pass at abducting Americans for whatever sick reason. Some people are abducted and don't have bad experiences. Others aren't so lucky.
1336586277416734720 2020-12-09 16:19:35 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> There is also the chance were dealing with more than one bad group of aliens. It's thought that one of these groups came in after the first initial contact with Eisenhower &amp; convinced to take a different deal. In order to beat Russia (who probably works with other alien factions)
1336586276376604672 2020-12-09 16:19:35 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Apparently they tried to give us free electricity and Eisenhower turned them down. This meeting took place on February 18th 1954 in Californa at the Edwards Air Force Base.
1336586275462246400 2020-12-09 16:19:35 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> It's a scary thought. We can only hope help is on the way if it's not here already.
1336586274375921665 2020-12-09 16:19:35 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> My fear is the good aliens will try to emancipate earth from these right wing nazi assholes and then these 3 governments are gonna paint them as invaders.
1336586273302196225 2020-12-09 16:19:34 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Thankfully the good group has more power and the universe on their side. The war supposedly between good and evil has already been won. It just takes time for it to catch up on earth?
1336586272249417729 2020-12-09 16:19:34 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> You can bet your sweet ass Trump and Netanyahu are working with the bad group. I would even go as far as to say MBS is likely involved as well. This group of bad aliens is said to have actually inspired the nazis. So you can imagine what we are dealing with.
1336586271351771136 2020-12-09 16:19:34 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> So there are good aliens and bad aliens much like humans.

1336377243581419520 2020-12-09 02:28:58 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I noticed this happens with Black folks and poc interacting with white people too, specifically white women.
1336377242100830209 2020-12-09 02:28:57 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Men want women to coddle them and if we don't we're "mean".

1336375890754867202 2020-12-09 02:23:35 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I guess autistic men can do whatever they want to us autistic and disabled women. Don't you dare speak up about it! We're supposed to just shut up and take it.
1336375486398787588 2020-12-09 02:21:59 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Oh and then when I tried to warn the group we were in about him, men came running to his defense saying he was allowed to treat me like that bc he's autistic. Completely dismissing the fact I MIGHT BE AUTISTIC TOO
1336374940149407745 2020-12-09 02:19:49 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I was literally willing to give him a chance and I spoke to him one time not being like: uwu ‚ù§ at the end of every sentence and that's what did it for him lol  https://t.co/jZHGVs9D2X

1336374933207867392 2020-12-09 02:19:47 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I told him that's nice and all but I would rather get to know him and go on a date first. I stressed that maybe since we met during the pandemic it was a good thing bc I like to take things VERY slow. I get scared easily.
1336374931492364288 2020-12-09 02:19:46 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Thinking about that guy who inserted himself into my life when I was dying with Covid. He repeatedly brought up wanting me to move in with him or leave the country to be closer to him. He mentioned coming to see me too...

1334219155143266308 2020-12-03 03:33:29 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Anytime a white person tries to make me feel bad about hating cops and talking shit I remind them that they kill dogs.

1334215979694514179 2020-12-03 03:20:52 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> [CW: footage of police brutality]
1334215564064149508 2020-12-03 03:19:13 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> This is why I don't like sharing my name and I'm also a Little so I am deeply triggered
1334214709793480705 2020-12-03 03:15:49 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> @anthonyvclark20 I actually used this talking point on my mom and it worked (she's a Trumper). She agreed with me on something regarding the police for a change. So I reccomend to everyone use this on those who are gettable and not TFG it just might work.
1334212844376764419 2020-12-03 03:08:25 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> It's gross and telling. We're fucking monsters.
1334212843449802754 2020-12-03 03:08:25 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> White people especially white women are more concerned about their feelings and civility. ie: how hearing cuss words make them feel compared to hearing the cold blooded shrieks of the innocent.
1334212842506117126 2020-12-03 03:08:24 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> His screams were much much louder and troubling than the cussing but she didn't say a word because it didn't bother her.
1334212841407209473 2020-12-03 03:08:24 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Perfect example? Not 2 minutes later I was watching @rolandsmartin video on YouTube where they played footage of 18yo Zekee Rayford screaming bloody murder in fear he was going to be lynched by police officers.
1334212840492851203 2020-12-03 03:08:24 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I told her i just think it's words and there are other more important things in the world to be more upset about it.
1334212839431675907 2020-12-03 03:08:24 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I was watching @hasanthehun on YouTube on my phone no headphones. She overheard and got worked up because he was cussing.
1334212838454423552 2020-12-03 03:08:23 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> It's funny this defund the police talk as of late reminds me of recent interaction I had with my boomer aunt.
1334209931914989570 2020-12-03 02:56:50 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> @QueenOfShibes This is why I'm lowkey afraid of getting piercings again lol this would 100% happen to me and like you not just one time

1334207087325360128 2020-12-03 02:45:32 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I'm extremely white but at least I'm honest about it and not butthurt
1334205531838361609 2020-12-03 02:39:21 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Seriously white people think any form of criticism or push back automatically = bullying or oppression. As a fellow white, when I see other white folks especially white women engage in this kind of behavior the second hand embarrassment is STRONG
1334201180289970178 2020-12-03 02:22:04 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Surprisingly wholesome. I definitely haven't heard about this before now. A nice surprise.

1332895070144634881 2020-11-29 11:52:03 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I just want a decent partner who actually bathes themselves and is emotionally available. Is that too much to ask for?
1332894832281460737 2020-11-29 11:51:06 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> He was an upgrade but a downgrade at the same time compared to my previous ex.
1332894583710248961 2020-11-29 11:50:07 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> His family hates me like I'm some evil abusive bitch who hurt this grown ass man who doesn't know how to wash his own ass.
1332894360732659719 2020-11-29 11:49:14 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> He was so dirty and it's not even funny. I can talk HELLA shit and all of it is true. Idgaf after what he did to me. I had to get tested. You don't do that shit to someone.

How could you keep all that excess money knowing others are hungry and homeless? Why keep it all when you can literally help so many people and possibly even save lives? It doesn't make sense to me.

1332813769563639817 2020-11-29 06:28:59 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> thread by me! enjoy
1332811151118360579 2020-11-29 06:18:35 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> [end]
1332811150149386241 2020-11-29 06:18:35 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Right now my focus is on becoming a full time content creator and eventually having a decent stream of revenue coming in so I can move out and finally live my life the way I was meant to be.
1332811148962488322 2020-11-29 06:18:35 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> After all the heart break and truama I experienced in those 6+months begging for work around my entire city...I probably won't look for work again. Even after the pandemic. I try not to be hard on myself because at least I tried.
1332811148157128705 2020-11-29 06:18:34 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Honestly this entire situation with this woman and then also getting let go after I actually landed a job because I'm disabled...it really breaks your spirit. I gave up.
1332811147322470400 2020-11-29 06:18:34 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> She felt despite my friendships and knowledge of the Salvation Army I shouldn't let that get in the way of finding a job. It was pretty gross and this probably should have been a great opportunity for me to cut things off with her but no.
1332811146395574279 2020-11-29 06:18:34 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> She tried to make it seem like if I really wanted a job I had to sacrifice my ethics and dignity even though I explained to her literally all my friends are gay and trans.
1332811145380581377 2020-11-29 06:18:34 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> She found a job listing for the Salvation Army and suggested I apply. I explained to her I am not comfortable working for anyone who is vehemently and openly homophobic and transphobic.
1332811144638164992 2020-11-29 06:18:33 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> anywaysssssss before that went down
1332811143757312006 2020-11-29 06:18:33 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> If I wasn't a nice white lady who knew how to talk to cops I'm sure I would have been taken away and missed my interview. Whcih...is her job right? To help me get a job???? WHICH REQUIRES AN INTERVIEW
1332811142868111365 2020-11-29 06:18:33 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Eventually this year back in February we encountered a situation where I didn't want to continue speaking to her the day before an interview I had by the way.  She called in a wellness check.
1332811141861568514 2020-11-29 06:18:33 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> While working with her I expressed openly I live in an abusive situation and I suffer from some bad depression, PTSD, and sometimes even su*cidal thoughts. She seemed to be understanding but I was wrong.
1332811141123338240 2020-11-29 06:18:33 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> You can already see she probably had no business being a job coach for disabled people.
1332811139416264704 2020-11-29 06:18:32 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I literally ended up crying for the rest of the day about that. It was really horrible for me. When I brought it up to her she apologized but at the same time claimed she would ask skinny people too if they had considered ever gaining weight.  https://t.co/3amA6DfJgd
1332811129983275008 2020-11-29 06:18:30 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Right around when we just started working together I don't think it had been too long she had out of the blue asked me if I considered losing weight. I was so shocked I didn't know how to defend myself or anything in the moment.
1332811128955670533 2020-11-29 06:18:30 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I had issues before with her that I ignored to my own detriment. I thought I could work past them and she could still help me find work despite having constant conflicts.
1332811127852560386 2020-11-29 06:18:29 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I believe I started working with my job coach in 2019 into 2020 for roughly 6 months or more. I'm not too sure since it's been a long time since we spoke.

1332484317101121536 2020-11-28 08:39:52 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Imagine using slurs and bashing other gay folks because of internalized homophobia, a lack of understanding and a "disagreement" over a simple concept (Comm*nism) you don't seem to want to understand. Yikes.

1332467206123380738 2020-11-28 07:31:52 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> They will either admit the truth and the MAGAts will turn on them just like they did Fox News. OR? They will pretend they made a mistake or mispoke üôÑ And nothing will change

1332451273304649729 2020-11-28 06:28:33 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> It's always interesting to me when non white and non straight folks cater to white supremacy and the establishment all the while the boot is still on our necks.
1332450676270641153 2020-11-28 06:26:11 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> He accused me of being as violent and racist as Donald Trump because I tried telling him how Native folks consider Matoaka's other name to be a slur now. Oh but don't worry everyone! He thinks Becky and Karen is actually the real slur that's being used against us poor white women

1332447922366111744 2020-11-28 06:15:15 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I was disabled my entire life too (I assume) but when you have incompetent, neglectful parents you just assume you're "normal" and don't try to question it.
1332447387822993408 2020-11-28 06:13:07 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I considered myself straight for many years but that isn't true. I don't think it ever was.

1329180665498243078 2020-11-19 05:52:20 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I hate crying. I literally feel like I cry every day and I can't stand it. If I cry too hard it's followed by actual physical pain in my face like someone had been beating me.
1329180349079973894 2020-11-19 05:51:04 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I just want to stop crying for like 1 or 2 days is that too much to ask for????

1329174728809050113 2020-11-19 05:28:44 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> this triggered me really bad probably because I experienced similar situations and blocked many of them out ü•¥

1329169169582088198 2020-11-19 05:06:39 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> My great aunt was the youngest of her siblings and the sickest. She lived the longest and out lived EVERYONE. She would have been 93yo this month...
1329162882802651136 2020-11-19 04:41:40 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> It's funny as a child I honestly didn't see myself living past 21 but now I'm 28. Once I passed that marker I knew oh shit I am never getting out this am I?
1329162560113926144 2020-11-19 04:40:23 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I know the good die young because I've always had the feeling I would out live everyone and so far I have. In the last two years ALONE I've lost 13 people. Many of them were my age or younger.
1329161896889638917 2020-11-19 04:37:45 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I miss Michael Brooks so unbelievably much ü•∫
1329158817762959361 2020-11-19 04:25:31 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Just in case it comes up again everyone: I am disabled, unemployed and I can't even afford my own bills. I have no problem boosting your crowd funding but I can't donate. If I could I would but my money isn't my own. They get mad at me for having to pay for everything already...
1329157813600477187 2020-11-19 04:21:31 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I also seem to keep dreaming about my aunt...I must miss her a lot because I never dreamt about her so often
1329157627159441409 2020-11-19 04:20:47 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I had a horrific dream, the kind I can't remember very clearly but I remember enough to know it happened.
1329157572679659521 2020-11-19 04:20:34 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I can't say what my day is yet. I haven't been up long and I forgot I am supposed to have  family therapy later today. Hoping for the best.

1329053120920510464 2020-11-18 21:25:31 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Now imagine for a second it wasn't just someone who touched your heart but everyone. That is life for me 24/7. I have always felt too deeply. It is both a blessing and curse.
1329052564029988865 2020-11-18 21:23:18 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> As wild as this sounds: we actually might start seeing stuff like this IRL. 2021 is gonna get real weird. I can feel it.

1329050814602764291 2020-11-18 21:16:21 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Twitter makes me so emotional. I have too much love for the world to see it in so much pain.
1329050689159524355 2020-11-18 21:15:51 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> it made me emotional too
1329050632297336833 2020-11-18 21:15:37 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I hate seeing more tweets like this. It breaks my heart. The world is so cruel to those we should protect.

1329009733324468228 2020-11-18 18:33:06 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> When she's home and sick I'm taking care of her. She thinks I'm so great and doing so much.
1329009159606595585 2020-11-18 18:30:50 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Literally one day where I didn't do as much as the others days and I still get flak for it. Even though I'm constantly paranoid about it and struggling to keep up with demands.

1329007727142637569 2020-11-18 18:25:08 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I have auditory dyslexia and no matter how many times I tell them it doesn't matter

1329007297222336512 2020-11-18 18:23:26 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Then they get mad when I don't want to spend extra time with them or I have keep pausing what I'm listening to because they keep talking.
1329006655992983554 2020-11-18 18:20:53 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I just want a little peace...and maybe one day to actually get along with my family...and not be completely annoyed by their existence and words constantly
1329006449368969216 2020-11-18 18:20:03 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I'm so tired of this world
1329006419232907265 2020-11-18 18:19:56 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I'm so tired of white women
1329006358855905280 2020-11-18 18:19:42 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> When I tried to tell her I didn't want to keep the conversation dragging she got huffy with me
1329006170200272896 2020-11-18 18:18:57 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I don't want to be lectured by someone who literally doesn't know how their own body works.
1329006013140398080 2020-11-18 18:18:19 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Then having my mom lecture me as if she isn't a full grown woman who doesn't know how her own sex organs work
1329005271759380485 2020-11-18 18:15:23 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I hate feeling like I have to be productive constantly no natter how exhausted I am every day.

1328895271141576705 2020-11-18 10:58:16 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> @HemskVampyr For some reason unknown to me I can't interact with new men on the internet whether for friendship or dating. It always ends badly and goes terribly wrong for me. I have enough friendships and I'll have to stick to dating only IRL
1328894703031513089 2020-11-18 10:56:01 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> no more crushes for me
1328894519853666305 2020-11-18 10:55:17 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> @AfroChingona yeah it's valid but I think it always depends on the person and situation so it's up to you ultimately how you choose to respond.

1328887885542666248 2020-11-18 10:28:56 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I hate my brain.
1328887818668675072 2020-11-18 10:28:40 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> But for some reason I'm still afraid to share pix online or even with my friends??? ü§îü§îü§î
1328887741346701312 2020-11-18 10:28:21 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I feel like a ******* because I know I am attractive. Everytime I interact with people IRL I get random ass compliments since I dyed my hair for Halloween.
1328887171592450048 2020-11-18 10:26:05 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I shared in my favorite BBW group and I got literally nothing. Usually they're great about it but they weren't the last time. I haven't felt right about sharing pix since.
1328886370702594048 2020-11-18 10:22:54 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I wanna share pix of my new hair but I keep getting in my own head ü•¥ it sucks so much ass. I've been trying to take MORE pictures but when I do I am afraid to share them...

1328854265796972547 2020-11-18 08:15:20 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> @_cassiopeiamoon I'm just glad somewhat to know I'm not the only who feels like this... So many of us there are in the world and still our voices remain unheard to many. That's how the people I'm around irl make me feel at least. Like being able-bodied is normal and default üò°

1328843223436038149 2020-11-18 07:31:27 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> @MisplacedG There was never a time I didn't love animals. That was something I was born with and taught. Animals opened my heart to the rest of the world. The more I loved people the more I learned and learned how to love even more than I had originally thought possible.
1328842454016143362 2020-11-18 07:28:24 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Thanks for teaching me how to love
1328842342569218050 2020-11-18 07:27:57 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Fall in love with humans and you will see and experience some of the most beautiful things on earth.

1328826590499921922 2020-11-18 06:25:22 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Cats are kinda like some dogs and you can train them. Regarding this situation I personally recommend giving them other places up high they can climb and walk on. If cats have a higher place they can watch you from they will take it over the counters
1328824066732675074 2020-11-18 06:15:20 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> *sweats*

1328822386121125890 2020-11-18 06:08:39 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> All I ask of the people I follow on here is please for the love of God don't make me regret following you lol
1328820374402949122 2020-11-18 06:00:40 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> We are hairless apes covered in weird snake skin...who gives a fuck what kind material you put on depending on what's between your legs? Makes no goddamn sense
1328820046165143557 2020-11-18 05:59:21 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Meat bodies, skin suites, it's all the same thing
1328819935984963585 2020-11-18 05:58:55 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Imagine caring how other humans dress their meat bodies lmfao
1328819520086085638 2020-11-18 05:57:16 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> privilege at its finest
1328817996811427840 2020-11-18 05:51:13 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> It's just like self hating gays or fat folks: please just stop
1328817704560709634 2020-11-18 05:50:03 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Ableism is hard and often worse when other disabled people do it to you
1328816845013573632 2020-11-18 05:46:38 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> me ü•¥ I definitely need one
1328816696770048000 2020-11-18 05:46:03 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> this
1328815863382876162 2020-11-18 05:42:44 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Now I'm paranoid I have this ü•¥ I looked it up and I'm gonna talk to my doctors about it. It could be something or nothing. I'm just tired of being tired and feeling like I'm an imposter because no one around me seems to accept that I am disabled
1328810823582625796 2020-11-18 05:22:43 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I'm tired of everyone existing in bubbles of ignorance and cognitive dissonance. I'm gonna pop them all one by one.
1328810442744094731 2020-11-18 05:21:12 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> People still act like I can just pack all my things right now and walk out on my family in a pandemic like I'm NOT disabled and financially dependent on my abusers.
1328809741397725186 2020-11-18 05:18:25 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> People love giving terrible advice to folks in situations they never experienced or understand even on a basic level. Especially if you're poor and/or being abused. Everyone magically has a solution for your life! It's remarkable really.
1328808430187008008 2020-11-18 05:13:12 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> @Lovestained555 Oh wow I had no idea because I have PlayStation. If you get Twitch lmk I like helping my content creating friends ‚ù§

1328801591374254081 2020-11-18 04:46:01 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> PSA:
1328800992545153024 2020-11-18 04:43:39 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> After being abused, brainwashed, and on auto pilot for roughly 23 years I refuse to allow myself to be manipulated or misled ever again. In some situations it is unavoidable. That being said I will still use my all my power and discernment to avoid going down a similar route.
1328799626221285376 2020-11-18 04:38:13 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Sometimes I am not always able to tell the difference between someone who is genuine and actual bad faith actors. For this reason I must be extra vigilant.
1328798039813857283 2020-11-18 04:31:55 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> and that's absolutely terrifying
1328796739772559360 2020-11-18 04:26:45 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> @mathew_wk me:  https://t.co/PViy1ZwEIK
1328796229451608064 2020-11-18 04:24:43 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> The most accurate thing in the world right now
1328795176886808582 2020-11-18 04:20:32 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I didn't even know Twitter stories were a thing damn y'all
1328794430191636484 2020-11-18 04:17:34 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> ie: child sex trafficking and forced hysterectomies and sterilization via ICE
1328794429486985216 2020-11-18 04:17:34 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> It's 2020 and there's still a lot of us who like to pretend that some things aren't only completely possible but already happening.
1328792983530053634 2020-11-18 04:11:49 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I'm sure there are consensual parties but that doesn't mean there aren't dark crowds with darker tastes. I think it's a spectrum and a lot of people are on it. Including Jon Voight.
1328792982607323136 2020-11-18 04:11:49 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I seen a video years back of Angelina talking about the rituals they do in Hollywood and elite circles. It sounds ridiculous but who ever said these people aren't fucking ridiculous and also having extravagant sex parties?
1328792981751607299 2020-11-18 04:11:49 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> When I watch Jon Voight I understand why Angelina Jolie is the way she is. He definitely believes in Q but still partakes in rituals. Probably getting paid off by the Trump admin for PR. Probably one reason why she hates Jon's guts.
1328783657172164617 2020-11-18 03:34:46 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Kyle did a video on that pro Trump Jon Voight video that was circulating on Twitter recently. I didn't watch it. Gonna watch it now. Let the hilarity begin.
1328779774517514240 2020-11-18 03:19:20 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> @odetomedusa That's basically been me since I had my Covid situation ü•¥ The brain fog never completely lifted and I'm sure being stressed doesn't help. I wish you peace of mind and rest ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
1328774108058882048 2020-11-18 02:56:49 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Some equate Sama'el with the "literal" Devil. Meaning Set is both God and the Devil...so Christians are worshiping God and the Devil! Playing both sides while wondering why nobody likes them.
1328774107228483585 2020-11-18 02:56:49 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Wild thing about Set? There's a chance he isn't just the god of the bible. There is a chance Set is also the same entity know as Sama'el, another name for the Devil (a demon) or the "god" of this world.
1328770415574081543 2020-11-18 02:42:09 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> This is the most accurate artistic rendition of Set I've seen to date. This is apparently just one of his original forms. Behold your Christian and Catholic so called jealous god of the bible: Yahweh  https://t.co/TupKszA1pm
1328769278674423809 2020-11-18 02:37:38 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I recently personally experienced something that confirmed for me that Set is Yahweh from the bible and the "I am a jealous god" trope is extremely fitting.
1328768361698881539 2020-11-18 02:33:59 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> @regretmotron omg
1328768224180187137 2020-11-18 02:33:26 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Trump apparently almost started WW3 with Iran after he lost the election. Surprised I'm only hearing about this now. The media should be drowning him in this. This is unacceptable. They are complicit.

1328652112188891137 2020-11-17 18:52:03 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> this country is cruel and sick
1328652039858102272 2020-11-17 18:51:46 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> my heart aches
1328649284452052993 2020-11-17 18:40:49 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I will continue to lift voices and listen to them.
1328648955941576704 2020-11-17 18:39:30 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> The world is far uglier than most of care to admit.
1328647676095852545 2020-11-17 18:34:25 +0800 <emilyisdeadd>  https://t.co/N9lfYRhACs
1328647224746790913 2020-11-17 18:32:38 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I knew that post never felt right
1328646506308571137 2020-11-17 18:29:46 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> we need a general strike because the people who run this country will kill us if we don't eventually and fleece us clean
1328633152504553480 2020-11-17 17:36:43 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Another gross thing about the church is they will steal bodies and use them as spiritual weapons as well. If they do this to their Saints and Blessed ones they probably take the bodies of other individuals they would view as "evil" and spiritually gifted/enhanced
1328632426285969408 2020-11-17 17:33:49 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> @regretmotron lmfao who is this?
1328632215304024064 2020-11-17 17:32:59 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> They claimed these things were evil so they could steal them basically. They didn't want anyone else to use them.
1328631877654163456 2020-11-17 17:31:39 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> An example of this is a Catholic Saint cutting down an acient "evil" chestnut or walnut tree in Italy and making it into an alter the church would use for rituals and ceremonies üòí
1328631876429471745 2020-11-17 17:31:38 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Catholicism especially is known to hunt down supposed "evil" sites and objects in order to use them for their own agenda. If something was truly evil you wouldn't incorporate it into your religion JUST SAYING.
1328630562039472128 2020-11-17 17:26:25 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> My reason for saying that is partly the speaking in tongues and communion which is feasting on the "metaphorical" human remains.
1328630071792427009 2020-11-17 17:24:28 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I think the hype and fear over Satanism is overblown and overstated to draw attention away from the "real" Satanists who are actually Christians and Catholics.
1328629696813277187 2020-11-17 17:22:59 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Most Jews and Muslims are perfectly lovely but I can't say the same about Christians.
1328629599538982912 2020-11-17 17:22:35 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I do believe Christianity including Catholicism is a kind of death cult. I can't speak on Judaism or Islam.
1328629150068969475 2020-11-17 17:20:48 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Frankly if anyone or anything would be synonymous with Satanism it would be straight cis folks who are into Christianity and Catholicism but that's just like my opinion man..
1328628904517578752 2020-11-17 17:19:50 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I am really curious how being gay became synonymous with Satanism.
1328628502988550145 2020-11-17 17:18:14 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> You can't make it make sense!
1328628458122055680 2020-11-17 17:18:03 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> That makes it seem like straight folks are automatically Godly or God like? HOW lmfao  https://t.co/0JJsolrvw4
1328627908743729152 2020-11-17 17:15:52 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> y'all why is everything queer automatically considered Satanic? seriously I wanna know is the Devil gay or something?

1328600070019833856 2020-11-17 15:25:15 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> So this a good thread that corroborates my theory on our reality being scripted:
1328598228003147777 2020-11-17 15:17:56 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> me: I have scoliosis  an asshole: Have you considered walking?
1328594206588329984 2020-11-17 15:01:57 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> @AuntyCarpetWeed Being a picky eater. It fucks with you in more ways than one.

1328586241357606912 2020-11-17 14:30:18 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> This is literally why I CAN'T be around people who act out in bad faith because my brain will try to argue for them and in agreement WHEN IT'S NOT TRUE OR LOGICAL
1328585193633046530 2020-11-17 14:26:08 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> This is a slow game and I need support. People just want to fix things or wave magic wand. Things are not always that simple.
1328585192634785793 2020-11-17 14:26:08 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> They insist I should have someone I can move in with when I don't. My friends would take me but they couldn't pay for things. To ask that of anyone is asinine. If I tried to live with my father I fear it would negatively affect our already good relationship we worked so hard on.
1328585191644868614 2020-11-17 14:26:08 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> That's what abusers do. People in my life will still gaslight me and try to say I don't actually want to leave. That hurts me even more and causes me more stress.
1328585190713782275 2020-11-17 14:26:08 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> If I wasn't disabled and completely dependent on my family I could easily leave. But I am. They also could react badly if I try to leave. My mom has retaliated against me before.
1328585189723869184 2020-11-17 14:26:07 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I am dealing with a Boomer Zoomer who has convinced herself it's okay to treat her own child like a partner. This has been going on since I was a VERY small child. It's called emotional incest. It's abusive and fucked up on many levels.
1328582899302592516 2020-11-17 14:17:01 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> And people act like it's easy for people just leave abusive situations üò°üòí  https://t.co/pZ0zTa0LN5
1328582654313324544 2020-11-17 14:16:03 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> My own mother SHOULD know this and she STILL does this to me.
1328582301215825921 2020-11-17 14:14:39 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I mean sorry but my brain is so fucked up and open to suggestion. What she's saying isn't true and it's bullshit but because the way my brain is wired I think "well Emily why would your mom keep saying that if it wasn't true or you weren't doing something wrong?"
1328581748834361347 2020-11-17 14:12:27 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Since that happened she has said REPEATEDLY I don't want her to be happy.
1328581659147579394 2020-11-17 14:12:06 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> The mistake in question: I gave her a hard time about singing a patriotic American song once and I apologized for it multiple times üòë
1328581521465339904 2020-11-17 14:11:33 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Like how fucked up you gotta be that you claim your adult child doesn't want you to be happy because she made a mistake one time and asks you to follow some simple boundaries?
1328580599980953601 2020-11-17 14:07:53 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> So the new thing with her is that I don't want her to be happy and if that isn't the most white woman thing ever.
1328580118722318342 2020-11-17 14:05:58 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I told her repeatedly I didn't know what was going on. Like I couldn't even process her full sentences and somehow I managed to piss her off in that kind of state of consciousness.
1328580117967278080 2020-11-17 14:05:58 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Last night I was so out of it and tired she started screaming at me and I literally had no idea what was happening. All I know I was on the verge of passing out and all of sudden she's screeching at me because of something I said or did.
1328579390020653057 2020-11-17 14:03:05 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> This is what it like to have a parent who has the emotional maturity of a 16yo. Welcome to my personal Hell.
1328579389114773507 2020-11-17 14:03:04 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> She says she isn't allowed to sing and I don't want her to be happy just because I literally don't like it when she's screaming and singing while I'm trying to sleep. Our house is old, the walls are thin. I was exhausted from taking my dog to the vet and everything that happened.
1328579387969638404 2020-11-17 14:03:04 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> She said I hurt her feelings and made her forget what she was gonna tell me. She couldn't understand what made me agitated (I just woke up and almost fell, made a mess). This started another screaming match where she is telling me I just don't want her to be happy.
1328579387034394625 2020-11-17 14:03:04 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> While that was happening I almost fell and knocked a bag of empty pill bottles onto the floor. I was irritated to say the least. My emotions are wound tight because I am hormonal from not having my birthcontrol. My mom KNOWS this.
1328579386107437057 2020-11-17 14:03:04 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> It causes me to stress out. As this is happening my mom tells me she wants to tell me something else. Even though I already asked if there was something else she wanted to talk about and she said no.
1328579385285373953 2020-11-17 14:03:03 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> My mom was singing and screaming while I was sleeping. She made me get up and then said she had to talk to me. She basically just repeated something I already knew. I took off my robe to go back in my bedroom where my cat was unattended. I don't like him being in there without me
1328476916169510912 2020-11-17 07:15:53 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> were basically gotta get her treated by a dog chiropractor and we'll go from there. she's seen the chiro before and it did help. it worth a try and i trust my vet.
1328476780425080833 2020-11-17 07:15:21 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> so we have some answers. apparently if my dog's back is fucked up it could mess with her stomach and digestion. i had no idea lol
1328414174276448258 2020-11-17 03:06:34 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> We're bringing Carly in to the vet at 4pm. I'll let yall know what happens

1328124318530859011 2020-11-16 07:54:47 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Of course a disgusting creep shows up in my life AT THE SAME TIME my dog is really sick. I'm so scared, guys. Right now I'm waiting on the vet to respond to my email. I'm officially in tears.

1327633254359441411 2020-11-14 23:23:28 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> He fucked and married his sister, made a horse a Roman Senator before he was killed by his guards and replaced by his uncle Claudius: a old stuttering fool (Biden)!
1327633253415710721 2020-11-14 23:23:28 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> If we go by the history he is Caligula.
1327633252115476482 2020-11-14 23:23:28 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> If we go by appearances alone Trump would be Nero (below) or possibly Tiberius.  https://t.co/vIprLU7jMN

1327380352990588928 2020-11-14 06:38:32 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I just don't want anyone to go through shit like that on any level. Doctors are supposed to care for and protect their patients. No excuses.
1327380351874965505 2020-11-14 06:38:32 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Please if you feel ever uncomfortable with a doctor or they make comments that bother you, try to find another doctor if possible (easier said than done and I hate it). Ask for a referral or something, anything. You don't deserve subpar treatment under any circumstances.
1327379397364633603 2020-11-14 06:34:44 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I can't blame myself but the way my brain is wired it basically wants to believe that no matter the situation is.
1327379323351871489 2020-11-14 06:34:26 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I keep thinking about the doctor who hurt me. Now I have a feeling of "Wow I can't believe I let someone do that to me  and treat me like shit." I was so caught off guard and vulnerable.

1321536064255856640 2020-10-29 03:35:25 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I'm trying to ruin their plans.
1321536031758364674 2020-10-29 03:35:17 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> More to come later. Hopefully you guys don't think I've completely lost it. I am just sharing information I know to be true in wealthy and religious circles. This IS what these people actually believe. Does that mean it will happen? Well I fucking hope not.
1321535344433573889 2020-10-29 03:32:33 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> It might say it's Jesus or something (it's not). This thing is gonna pretend to save us from something and then it will replace Francis as Pope. This is will be the supposed Black Pope.
1321535343317950464 2020-10-29 03:32:33 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> This is not new information, just catching you guys up to speed:  From what I understand the rich Christians and possibly even other folks in other religions are aware Francis is the last Pope. Apparently there is a "Supreme Entity/Diety" that's gonna make itself know on earth.
1321535342193889280 2020-10-29 03:32:33 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I do not support or endrose what I am about to share with you. I only wish that you know this information so we can get a better understanding of what we are dealing with. Not only what these freakshows' believe in but anticipate and WISH to happen.

1321517156253765632 2020-10-29 02:20:17 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> This is one way she would put her anxiety on me and also another form of emotional incest. Expecting your child to regulate your emotions or be in charge of your spending habits as the adult. It's a cruel thing to do any child.
1321517155251294211 2020-10-29 02:20:17 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> This would usually happen after she spent money on something that we didn't need. New shoes, purses, cellphones. I would almost be crying as a child asking why we bought things we didn't need when we can't pay our bills? She always played dumb.
1321517154244714496 2020-10-29 02:20:16 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> [cw: emotional incest]  Everytime my mom or aunt brings up money issues in present day it triggers my anxiety and reminds me of when I was a kid with no power or control over anything. As a child my mom would share how worried she was about paying bills.
1321514536105594880 2020-10-29 02:09:52 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I just wish that if you're no longer in my life you stay tf out of my dreams. Is that too much to ask?

1319443562594009089 2020-10-23 09:00:34 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I got fresh memes for yall
1319443186402603010 2020-10-23 08:59:04 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Everyone has been so terrible lately it feels like world is trying desperately to cannibalize itself.
1319443014868258816 2020-10-23 08:58:23 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I started working on my content for my show again. I want this to be my private Twitter but I might make an offical account for my work on Twitch.
1319442184421150721 2020-10-23 08:55:05 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> The whole situation triggered my PTSD to say the least.
1319442183657840641 2020-10-23 08:55:05 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> This is why women and people who have been abused and taken advantage of don't speak out.
1319442182881857537 2020-10-23 08:55:05 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> And I have a 30 day ban on Facebook anyways so what's the fucking point?
1319442182030430209 2020-10-23 08:55:04 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> There was still men trying to defend him though. I was basically being victim blamed and mocked again like in my first post. I left the group. An admin messaged me but I found little comfort in his words. I told him the damage had already been done.
1319442181216751616 2020-10-23 08:55:04 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> The group suddenly saw the new post and I got a wave of support.
1319442180428226563 2020-10-23 08:55:04 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I just wanted to warn other women who might be more vulnerable than I am.
1319442179446767616 2020-10-23 08:55:04 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> Obviously I only shared 3 screens but they pulled it down despite the fact it didn't reveal any information about him. I didn't dox him and I didn't want people going after him.
1319442178582712320 2020-10-23 08:55:04 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> My intial post was taken down because I shared proof of him asking me to live with him (he did this 3-5 times and I have 50 screens of proof he was lying to me at the very least or trying to manipulate me).
1319442177685151745 2020-10-23 08:55:03 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I immediately blocked him and decided to warn the women in the group he found me in. Inserting yourself in someone's life when their dying while getting their hopes up is cruel. And to gaslight me about it was even more twisted.
1319442175512424450 2020-10-23 08:55:03 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I got better and off my death bed. I decided to confront him and he flipped.  https://t.co/oCTXknag7c
1319442167451013121 2020-10-23 08:55:01 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> As soon as I asked what we would do when he would come see me he flipped his tune. Suddenly wasn't interested and wanted me to carry on with my life without him holding me back. It was obvious I caught him red handed.
1319442166553497602 2020-10-23 08:55:01 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> He had asked me to live with him multiple times, said he wanted to send me money even though I hadn't asked, and told me he would come visit me after the pandemic.
1319442165601370115 2020-10-23 08:55:00 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> While I was on my death bed a man added me from a group I was in. He lead me on and made it seem he was more interested in me than he really was.
1319439645231468546 2020-10-23 08:45:00 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I am very lucky to be alive and that I didn't have to go to the hospital.
1319439522111913985 2020-10-23 08:44:30 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> So basically my mom infected me with covid and I almost died
1319439425663832065 2020-10-23 08:44:07 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> I'm gonna try to start using Twitter more often again because I am always having issues with ShitBook

1309649253753647106 2020-09-26 08:21:28 +0800 <emilyisdeadd> @aliwatson117 looks like Twitter is cracking down on everyone they shouldn't be üòí you're the second person now who said they lost an account this year
