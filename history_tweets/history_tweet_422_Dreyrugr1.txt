1344020727532548099 2020-12-30 04:41:26 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @Rizeus_V @BeigeShiba It's just not good game design IMO, and I miss when games actually had stats, everything has been dumbed down to these perk based system in large part thanks to ubisoft.
1344015232981737472 2020-12-30 04:19:36 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @BeigeShiba I was annoyed that they gave crafting its own perk tree. They took the already tedious witcher 3 crafting system where you pay other people to craft shit for you(which should still be an option at the very least) and made it even more complex and require stat investment.
1344013722881323010 2020-12-30 04:13:36 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> Why does everyone from new jersey look like they belong in a lovecraft story?  https://t.co/SRmndP0I34

1343555851869708289 2020-12-28 21:54:11 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @BeigeShiba This movie oozed with skin crawlingly disgusting levels of libtard. Even moderate libs couldn't stand it, you needed years of NPR hypnotism to even tolerate it.

1343377241951133697 2020-12-28 10:04:27 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @elaphos_ Well you see, about 60,000,000 years ago there was this reptilian race called the old ones who created most races in the galaxy...................... Fr tho, you can watch three hours of introductory lore and still have no idea what's going on lol.
1343375198679146504 2020-12-28 09:56:20 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @elaphos_ Well you see, some time in pre history Anatolia a bunch of shamans all killed themselves at the same time and created the combined soul of what would become the emperor..........

1342914035747053568 2020-12-27 03:23:50 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @StarBardent Dark humor is when jews make you think they're making fun of themselves when they mock white people.
1342634217595924483 2020-12-26 08:51:57 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> Most of my gifts are perishable items they can use or throw out like booze unless I know they want something specific.
1342634188399374340 2020-12-26 08:51:50 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> Gift giving's a pretty shit custom in our current consumer society. If I want something I'm just going to buy it, money is dirty, most hand crafted stuff is unwanted and just turns into clutter you can't get rid of.

1341188359063007237 2020-12-22 09:06:37 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> I suspect slave owners had a very similar attitude towards blacks as the average libtard. There's no way anyone else could stand to be around them.
1341184984946794498 2020-12-22 08:53:13 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> Shitting on Burzum is a bit of a freebie considering Varg himself doesn't like it and most people who do are just salty about muh racism and Varg being the most legitimately edgy person in black metal.

1340740128780775424 2020-12-21 03:25:31 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> My local flea market has some Mexicans who illegally sell burnt CDs and they've been doing it for like 15 years.

1340501116522475522 2020-12-20 11:35:46 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @BeigeShiba After level 20 you can buy an item from a ripperdoc for 100,000 credits that lets you respec all your skills but not attributes.
1340463861250609154 2020-12-20 09:07:43 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @Florky15 @BeigeShiba with tech pistols you can just straight up one shot everything through walls. It sounds like both routes are very effective.
1340463493124927492 2020-12-20 09:06:16 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @BeigeShiba Oh and I just tested this, you also lose access to breach protocol when you replace your cyberdeck so if you want the most effective fighter possible you may want to avoid int all together.
1340461651796123651 2020-12-20 08:58:57 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @Florky15 @BeigeShiba IDK about quickhacks but pistols and blades deal absurd critical damage. There's a legendary katana that boosts critical damage by 500%. Not to mention cool and reflexes both boost critical so I suspect those do more crit when put together than quickhacks.
1340457002246520832 2020-12-20 08:40:28 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @BeigeShiba Early on quickhacks are useful for a non netrunner, but breach protocol is going to hold up better in the long run because you're going to want to replace your cycberdeck with the berserk implant.
1340448054227431432 2020-12-20 08:04:55 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @BeigeShiba This is like 90% of the cyberpsycho missions.

1340085462254428161 2020-12-19 08:04:06 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @ProgenyOfEurope That type of magazine won't even work with a rimfire cartridge and even if it did it will have an extremely inconstant spring pressure and it has to rotate the cartridge 90 degrees which gets funky with a tiny cartridge.

1340079862992781312 2020-12-19 07:41:51 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> Can't believe my fucking 850 watt power supply is borderline acceptable with today's cards. I bought it with the intent of it being so overkill it would crush anything to come out 5 years down the line.

1340031058008543234 2020-12-19 04:27:55 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @BeigeShiba @boathog420 Yeah, I was hoping to squeeze another year out of it and I despise windows 10. Been saving up to rebuild from the ground up and I'm gonna go all out on a 3080 and liquid cooling in a few months.
1340014408093855746 2020-12-19 03:21:45 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @BeigeShiba @boathog420 Oh, I've pulled every trick and keep my drivers up to date. There's no difference between ultra and low, the only thing that gives me an fps boost is setting crowds to low so I think my ancient 8 year old amd fx 8350 is the problem and windows 7 probably isn't helping.
1340011696098783234 2020-12-19 03:10:59 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @boathog420 @BeigeShiba Runs like shit on my 5 year old pc with a 4ghz processor and a 980ti, which I never expected to be an issue in 1080p.
1339842746471882753 2020-12-18 15:59:38 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> At some point bethesda is going to have to choose between modability and modernizing their games. Either way it's a lose lose and the company is fucked.
1339786489127944192 2020-12-18 12:16:05 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @xctlot This might be a good idea for the latino rifle association.

1339761120068988928 2020-12-18 10:35:17 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> Oh yeah and I'm not a fan of the crafting system. I don't think it ever should've gotten it's own skill tree and at the very least you should be able to pay people to craft shit for you like W3. Unique legendary clothing is also lacking.
1339758010365820928 2020-12-18 10:22:55 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> That said the voice acting is good, the story is good, and there's still is a lot of that good witcher 3 vibe in the game. The gunplay isn't as good as a proper FPS. Even though it's a perk based system the different attributes are at least as divergent as ME 1.
1339756993897242625 2020-12-18 10:18:53 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> Just about every side quest in witcher 3 was on par with the main quest which added greatly to immersion, a lot of that is lacking now so the world is at this uncomfortable middle ground between GTA and a proper RPG and it doesn't excel at either.
1339756955385147396 2020-12-18 10:18:44 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> Cpunk 2077 is a legit good game despite it's many flaws. Most of the glitches come down to it being the 2020 version of crisis so it runs like shit on 90% of rigs.  The worst thing about the game is the dumbed down side quests and ubisoft tier random events.
1339732528580726784 2020-12-18 08:41:40 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> Not to mention in the current environment you'd be heavily incentivized to not vax your children since the vast majority of people are vaxed so there's basically no risk whatsoever in not doing it.
1339730331537182721 2020-12-18 08:32:56 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> I'm not anti vax, but I have no doubt there are negative consequences and researches who attempt to run those studies are actively suppressed. At the end of the day the benefits outweigh the consequences on a macro level, but if the reality got out a lot of people would opt out.
1339722202732777472 2020-12-18 08:00:38 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> It's pretty fucking obvious that the mainstream right should've got ahead of the covid shit back in the "kiss your local chinaman" months, but conservatives are utterly oblivious to any and all opportunities unless it involves gatekeeping everyone further right.
1339715466407899136 2020-12-18 07:33:52 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> Alright, that mission where your cop neighbor's turtle that his grandmother gave him as a child which he viewed as his only remaining companion and memento to better times died so he locked himself in his apartment and gave up on life was bringing out the feels.  https://t.co/4Mg6PIAPgk

1339674345522802688 2020-12-18 04:50:28 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> The virgin denuvo vs the chad releasing your game so buggy it's unplayable without several months of patches.

1339499492526206980 2020-12-17 17:15:40 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @BeigeShiba Did you make your character clean or double down on the morbid bodily mutilation?
1339029103492665344 2020-12-16 10:06:30 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @PiousTusks Gameplay wise it's better than I was expecting, it's just buggy and needs a 2500 dollar pc to run it at 60 frames.
1338836997054619649 2020-12-15 21:23:09 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> Look at the size of this dude.  https://t.co/mborDu237w
1338833574687072259 2020-12-15 21:09:33 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @BeigeShiba In all honesty it's way more retro than I was expecting. It could do with more metal and less electronic music though.
1338520449127505923 2020-12-15 00:25:18 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @elaphos_ Ngl, would totally compromise myself for a cute Russian spy back in the soviet era lol.

1338509829946683392 2020-12-14 23:43:06 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @StarBardent The NVA were actually just a side show to the interal race wars, fragging your CO, and cia experiments.
1338136072572776452 2020-12-13 22:57:55 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> Blatant fucking lies btw. My system has older parts than these, but performance wise it's basically identical with slightly better ram and gpu and it runs like complete shit.  https://t.co/jBgaZ1us2X
1338131885025873927 2020-12-13 22:41:17 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> I have rogue anti virus programs on my computer that have basically become viruses.
1338099744397254657 2020-12-13 20:33:34 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @that_groyper @Witch_Hammer Thought it might have been the audio bug that a Windows update caused a few years ago. That sounds like an issue with your rig and graphics settings. Probably not worth the effort at this point, most oblivion mods are crude and ancient now.
1338095865316208643 2020-12-13 20:18:09 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @that_groyper @Witch_Hammer Is it stuttering right as you enter combat?
1338094745869021184 2020-12-13 20:13:42 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @that_groyper All you do is is put esp files and textures/meshes in your data folder like every other Bethesda game. You're probably not installing prequesite mods or downloading ancient mods set up for Oblivion mod manager.
1337925515445997573 2020-12-13 09:01:14 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @EldritchWebway No, it has light attacks, heavy attacks, combos, blocking, counters, bashing/shoving, grappling, and dodging. You don't control the direction of your attacks though.
1337904014915215363 2020-12-13 07:35:48 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> Cpunk 2077 has some of the best melee combat i've seen in any game. Way more fun than ranged TBH.
1337792905424089088 2020-12-13 00:14:18 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @ProgenyOfEurope Yeah, but their success is ephemeral. It will be gone with the next trend.

1337494347764420608 2020-12-12 04:27:56 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> Think it's funny that CDPR hyped up character customization and it isn't even on par with Skyrim which came out 10 years ago.
1337447098715869184 2020-12-12 01:20:11 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> Moderately hyped for darktide.
1337236325288841217 2020-12-11 11:22:39 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @louisbeamerboy Even before 2005 it was in all of Abnett's stuff, it was also in Ciaphas Cain. Pretty sure the English are just massive simps.
1337215289105272842 2020-12-11 09:59:03 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @louisbeamerboy Lol yeah, It's not even escapable with astartes, there's always a female inquisitor or something like it inserted in the mix. I wouldn't mind if they kept it to the inquisition or had a one off story in the guard, but I don't even think an all male baseline exists anywhere.
1337211721837056002 2020-12-11 09:44:53 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> For all the whining about 40k being too masculine pretty much every black library book about the Imperial guard has a feminist sublot about integrated male and female regiments. It's honestly amazing how consistent it is.

1336916327114698760 2020-12-10 14:11:05 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @manofbunker @BeigeShiba A lot of these arguments could be made for loads of different games. Almost all moderns games have ripped off the ubisoft formula, most fantasy RPGs are extremely similar. The games feel extremely different, I just think there isn't as much competition in that genre.
1336914010948718598 2020-12-10 14:01:53 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @manofbunker @BeigeShiba Calling them clones seems a bit like calling every isometric fantasy game a baldur's gate clone.
1336913988400148480 2020-12-10 14:01:48 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @manofbunker @BeigeShiba GTA has a lot of unmarked quests that are narrative heavy. Saint's row has very arcady mini game like side quests where you're doing things like hosing down houses with shit or blowing up cars in a helicopter.
1336910976902455296 2020-12-10 13:49:50 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @manofbunker @BeigeShiba Still don't think it's similar enough to be considered a clone. quest structure is significantly different, they're both open world sandboxes where you commit crimes and that's pretty much where the similarities end.
1336909222576082944 2020-12-10 13:42:51 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @manofbunker @BeigeShiba I was talking about the gta part not the rpg part.
1336908449167384577 2020-12-10 13:39:47 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @manofbunker @BeigeShiba Hard disagree on that, sr2 was far more of a sandbox and had better combat, customization, and vehicles. It still has features that gta hasn't caught up on.
1336891736451391490 2020-12-10 12:33:22 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @Witch_Hammer He made her more attractive than she actually is. Ben Garrison is thirsty AF.

1336876209343492098 2020-12-10 11:31:40 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @whoajack1 @PipPlays @BeigeShiba The witcher games were all fairly buggy and a game in a city with vehicles is inevitably going to be more buggy.
1336870639613964290 2020-12-10 11:09:32 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @BeigeShiba Imagine not having the willpower to wait for the patches so it's actually playable.
1336865744022368258 2020-12-10 10:50:05 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> Looks like cyberpunk is going to get wrecked by its own hype and buggy launch.

1336157163253878784 2020-12-08 11:54:26 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @HbdNrx America also has a history in turning the military into a clown show during down time while being ruthlessly pragmatic when it needs to be.

Outside of the most extreme aesthetics(which is what's usually advertised) there's a great deal of nuance, especially when it comes to internal conflict.

Most training is focused around the individual for grifting, liability, and safety purposes. Airsoft CAN be a training tool but the vast majority of it is COD larping which is worse than nothing.

1319770361001660416 2020-10-24 06:39:08 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> I prefer turn based to RTS games. RTS almost always boils down to using units that require the least micro management you can blob together. In turn based there's a lot more versatility and you get more out of specialized units and glass cannons.

I think it's better to have a large bore GPMG at the platoon level and something like an rpk 74/16 as your SAW.

1309635461267296256 2020-09-26 07:26:40 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @rodinrodin7 Empire should've cut Skyrim loose while they still had effective and sympathetic leadership. "oops! Looks like they won! well we tried."
1309630729555501056 2020-09-26 07:07:52 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @PiousTusks @HarmlessYardDog @VDAREJamesK That said there's a note in a fort near the border of Cyrodiil that claims the empire is bringing in several legions from the south to crush the rebellion. If that turns out to be the default a stormcloak victory is the absolute worst outcome.
1309630459861762049 2020-09-26 07:06:48 +0800 <Dreyrugr1> @PiousTusks @HarmlessYardDog @VDAREJamesK The dominion wanted a prolonged conflict with no swift resolution. A strong alliance between Skyrim and Hammerfell is arguably worse for them than a unified Empire especially in its current state of entropy.
