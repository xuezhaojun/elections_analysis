1344057763987509249 2020-12-30 07:08:36 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @jettnuke1 I respected Nixon and actually liked him.  As a Vietnam vet, I appreciated the fact that he had the courage to get us out of there.  Johnson didn't have the balls to either fight to win or get the hell out.  Also a Navy vet, Chief.

1343944341329330176 2020-12-29 23:37:54 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Can you imagine what would happen to a politician 50 years ago who would have voted to deny Americans a direct payment? He would have been voted out of office.  That was back when we voted and the vote actually counted.
1343943721667051521 2020-12-29 23:35:27 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Google needs to be brought down hard.  They have invaded almost every aspect of American life.  It was one thing to be a market influence but they should have never become a political influence.
1343943328228753413 2020-12-29 23:33:53 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Hey Senators:  You already voted for all the pork and wasteful spending in the stimulus bill, including billions going to other countries.  Now isn't the time to scrimp.  Give Americans back their own tax money so that they can survive the shutdowns.

1343752881590026240 2020-12-29 10:57:07 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Senators:  You have a chance to salvage some of your dignity and pass the addendum that's being presented by the house.  I know, it increases the debt.  So does giving money to Pakistan for gender studies.  Do the right thing for the people that put you there.
1343736243885015040 2020-12-29 09:51:00 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The house passed a bill to bring the individual stimulus payments up to $2,000.  It makes me wonder why they didn't do this in the first place.  Now it goes to the Senate.  Republicans, we're watching closely. The President has asked for it.  Do it! The time for games is over

1343625146645446657 2020-12-29 02:29:32 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Obama knew in 2016 that Joe Biden couldn't win against any Republican candidate.  That's why Hillary ran instead.  He knew he couldn't beat Trump, which was why the entire fraud operation was put into play.
1343624487372144640 2020-12-29 02:26:55 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @DirectiveH People could elect not to have unemployment - those would be people with sufficient savings to carry them through or multiple sources of income.  They would save the cost of the premium.
1343624172723814400 2020-12-29 02:25:40 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @DirectiveH True. And they don't pay as high a premium. People with expensive cars pay a higher premium than those with less expensive ones.  People without comprehensive coverage don't get anything unless the other party is at fault and pays.
1343606119239839744 2020-12-29 01:13:56 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @Dangler59401496 If a person has financial resources, it would stand to reason that they wouldn't need help from the government.  The other side of that coin is that everyone should have sufficient savings to respond to an emergency.  If their savings is in cash, the government doesn't know.
1343588999777058818 2020-12-29 00:05:54 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If unemployment insurance was really insurance, it would cover the majority of your salary for a significant period of time.  You pay a premium.  Your employer pays a premium.  You should get a benefit.  What if car insurance only covered 25% of the value of your car?

People are smothering to death because the virus attacks the respiratory system, unlike the flu. And yes, one's own immune system plays a part.
1343232583627284482 2020-12-28 00:29:38 +0800 <oldguy_steve> China has not only made us sick with the flu that they unleashed on the world, but they've also caused us to separate from each other, distrust each other, give up our traditions. and abandon what we value most - freedom and self-determination.

It's another for Congress to vote it in while ignoring the needs of the American people.  Congress didn't even read the bill, they didn't have time.
1342996709941465088 2020-12-27 08:52:21 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The media LOVES to point out how often the President plays golf.  I wonder if they'll point out how many times Biden plays canasta or checkers?

1342996052421459968 2020-12-27 08:49:45 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Joe Biden was seen on video bragging about blackmailing Ukraine into firing a prosecutor for going after his corrupt son.  Then President Trump gets impeached just for asking if it's really true.  Really?
1342995722157793280 2020-12-27 08:48:26 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @20meansspeed Yeah... asleep at the wheel here.
1342992844240289792 2020-12-27 08:37:00 +0800 <oldguy_steve> This is the United States.  Hell no, I won't press 1 for English!
1342992733456101376 2020-12-27 08:36:33 +0800 <oldguy_steve> In America, homeless families go without eating. Mentally ill go untreated. Elderly can't afford their meds. Our veterans don't always get the benefits they earned.   Why are we spending millions on gender studies in Pakistan?
1342903078664597504 2020-12-27 02:40:18 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Yeah, okay, I'm an American citizen, but I identify as an illegal alien.  Now, can I have my $1,800 instead of $2,000?
1342874474354335744 2020-12-27 00:46:38 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I don't worry about catching COVID.  After my company went public, my wife started putting small, undetectable amounts of rat poison in my coffee. It's been going on for decades. Now I'm immune to everything.
1342855827808403461 2020-12-26 23:32:33 +0800 <oldguy_steve> REALITY:  Trump sends a bill back to Congress because it called for a mere $600 in direct relief payments to Americans and demanded at least $2,000.  MSM: Trump denies Americans the help they need by refusing to sign the relief bill.
1342852766478127104 2020-12-26 23:20:23 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Even after the pandemic is over, politicians should still be required to wear masks and carry toilet paper because nothing but crap comes out of their mouths and it's toxic.  https://t.co/hP9SDchZaB
1342829782686265344 2020-12-26 21:49:03 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Now the fake news is trying to blame President Trump for threatening a veto to a bill that Congress couldn't get right in the first place.  Congress:  Send a clean bill with at least $2,000 in direct aid plus PPP and unemployment assistance.
1342824986067668997 2020-12-26 21:29:59 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @SpeakerPelosi Yeah, Nancy, don't forget to wish a merry Christmas to all of the small business owners who lost everything and to their employees who will be out of work.  Oh, and don't forget those who will be evicted from their homes - all because YOU were unable to help, bitch.
1342556126672351232 2020-12-26 03:41:38 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Son, here's my card. Would you go to the store and pick up a dozen eggs?  Sure mom, but I will also need a carton of smokes, a six-pack of Bud, gas for my girlfriend's car, a new iPhone, and Uncle Bill wants to borrow $500.

1342236740073922560 2020-12-25 06:32:31 +0800 <oldguy_steve> It's Christmas Eve and I'm pissed.  Instead of presents this year, I'm giving everyone my opinion. I'm not worried about size or color.  No returns.  If you don't like it, re-gift it.  Merry Christmas everyone.
1342236238300909569 2020-12-25 06:30:31 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Why did Congress give $1.3 billion to Egypt so that they could buy their military hardware from RUSSIA?  How many American jobs would it equate to if they purchased their military needs from the country that gave them the damn money in the first place?
1342235381496905728 2020-12-25 06:27:07 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Name a Member of Congress that deserves to be there today?
1342235247094599680 2020-12-25 06:26:35 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If I were to lose my business and livelihood to this pandemic because of Congress and their political screwing around with a relief package, I would be tempted to toss a match into the place before I closed the door on the way out.
1342234366722732032 2020-12-25 06:23:05 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If the fact that over 4,.7 billion dollars went to foreign countries, some of which are American adversaries, doesn't piss you off then you're not paying attention.  How many American families would that money bring off the street?  How many small businesses would it save?
1342232323186597888 2020-12-25 06:14:57 +0800 <oldguy_steve> What is the purpose of bringing jobs back to America if Congress is just going to ship our money overseas?  What the hell kind of logic is that. Over 500 members of Congress let that bill go to the Oval Office.  VOTE THEM OUT.  EVERY SINGLE LAST ONE OF THEM!
1342230342493597697 2020-12-25 06:07:05 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Even if there had been a unanimous vote on the stand-alone relief bill, there weren't enough representatives to form a quorum - fifty are required. They all left for the Christmas holiday.  Vote them out.  Both parties. All incumbents. Let's start over with a Congress that cares.

1341875242390568960 2020-12-24 06:36:03 +0800 <oldguy_steve> In the midst of a national pandemic when people are losing their jobs, closing their businesses, being evicted from their homes... the Congress of the United States voted themselves a $57K raise.  That's 33%.  How much did you get this year?  Was your approval rate only 15%?
1341872526817779712 2020-12-24 06:25:15 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @NancyCoats57 California should make Alcatraz the new state capitol.

Now, maybe Congress can send me the $10 million they were going to send to Pakistan.  I'll even kick in ten percent for the "Big Guy".

1341835061788725248 2020-12-24 03:56:23 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @MsGrinningSoul To help them through the pandemic, of course.  The President mentioned it in his speech.

1341691755620487168 2020-12-23 18:26:56 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Suddenly Pelosi, Ilhan Omar, AOC, and Chuck Schumer have said they are ready to draw up a $2,000 per person relief bill.  What about the billions wasted on foreign aid and the $1,800 going to immigrants?
1341690448176271361 2020-12-23 18:21:44 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @DailyCaller @BernieSanders Go away, Bernie.  You're not even genuine as a socialist.
1341690175672393729 2020-12-23 18:20:39 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Why are illegal aliens are getting $1,800, while Americans are only getting $600?  Whose money is it, anyway?  And here I thought Congress was wanting to get re-elected.
1341444366473318400 2020-12-23 02:03:54 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @MsGrinningSoul Yeah, and the $600 that taxpayers got will cover about two weeks of daycare.
1341444046770716672 2020-12-23 02:02:38 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @MsGrinningSoul Yeah.  I just commented on the gender studies in Pakistan.  Where do these idiots come up with such bizarre ideas and how come their constituents don't hold them accountable?
1341443720059613187 2020-12-23 02:01:20 +0800 <oldguy_steve> When you pay your tax bill next year, remember the TEN MILLION DOLLARS that was allocated for "gender programs" - in Pakistan!  Why do we care if someone in an Islamic country disagrees with the plumbing he was born with?  $10 million would do a lot for homeless Americans.
1341442986161315840 2020-12-23 01:58:25 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @suesbats Could be.  Being a husband, I instinctively chose wife.

The problem now is that members of Congress worry more about getting elected than they do about the people's business.  It should be an honor to serve, not a career.
1341396682026708993 2020-12-22 22:54:25 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Your wife uses your life savings to buy a car, jewelry, and a new wardrobe. She gives 25% of it to her friends. She takes out a high-interest loan for a new house. Embarrassed, she gives you $600 but still kicks you out the door.  That's what it's like being married to Congress.
1341394452330397696 2020-12-22 22:45:33 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Americans got $600 each of their own money.  Sudan got $700 million.  While we have Americans living in tents on the sidewalk, why?  https://t.co/xdHjxfE21U
1341389749789970432 2020-12-22 22:26:52 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Congress passed a $2.4 trillion stimulus bill.  The President wanted to issue $2,000 stimulus checks. . Instead, lawmakers included $600 stimulus checks.  Congress just wanted to go home for Christmas. They didn't miss any paychecks during the pandemic.
1341385399982149633 2020-12-22 22:09:35 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I wonder how much of the $700 million comes back to the "Big Guy"?
1341385088496328704 2020-12-22 22:08:21 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @AOC How many paychecks did you miss during the pandemic, Cortez?  Most of the crap in this and every other bill is put there by self-serving members of Congress looking to appease special interests - and that includes you.
1341066152601010181 2020-12-22 01:01:01 +0800 <oldguy_steve> In the TV series "Designated Survivor", the entire government, both houses of Congress, the President, VP, and the entire cabinet are wiped out by a bomb.

1341048496271499264 2020-12-21 23:50:51 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Cancel Culture wants us to abandon our traditions like Thanksgiving and Christmas family gatherings.

His stated beliefs are contrary to every one of our values as a nation.  He has the character of a hyena and the stamina of an earthworm on a hot sidewalk.
1340283886660538368 2020-12-19 21:12:34 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Walmart and Home Depot made a fortune staying open during the pandemic when other businesses had to close.  Ironically, they are now selling a variety of overpriced masks of various colors and patterns. - all of them MADE IN CHINA.

1339361096788967426 2020-12-17 08:05:44 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @VincentCrypt46 My opinion is that if information had not been leaked in the first place, there wouldn't be a problem.  Wikileaks is no place for our secret information.
1339360126776459266 2020-12-17 08:01:52 +0800 <oldguy_steve> We should have NEVER supported or collaborated with an infectious disease lab anywhere outside the United States - especially one run by a communist adversary.  It would be akin to letting Russia build our ICBMs.
1339356463068659712 2020-12-17 07:47:19 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @bobbr107 Yeah, and I stopped buying green bananas.
1339331491289952256 2020-12-17 06:08:05 +0800 <oldguy_steve> After you've taken a Biden, don't forget to wipe your Harris.
1339326621908549634 2020-12-17 05:48:44 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @VicTrumper Sounds like you have my car bugged.
1339325981220343812 2020-12-17 05:46:12 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @dcexaminer @JoeBiden Here we go.  I said the old bastard wouldn't make it to the inauguration.
1339325683273785348 2020-12-17 05:45:01 +0800 <oldguy_steve> There is no other way to put it.  Your elected officials are playing politics with your livelihood.  Shutdowns.   No COVID relief.    In any other country, these assholes wouldn't be running for office, they would be running for their lives.
1339324577072242688 2020-12-17 05:40:37 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @kirstiealley Check the seat cushion and under the chair.  Do you have a dog?
1339225540214087685 2020-12-16 23:07:05 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @pam_sands Help that kid!  He's being attacked!
1339224050506158080 2020-12-16 23:01:09 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @LockenessNyad I am a native Californian too.  Let me know when the fight starts and I'll be right there with you.
1339221166490206209 2020-12-16 22:49:42 +0800 <oldguy_steve> To heck with an AR-15.  I want a rocket-propelled grenade launcher.  Even if you miss, they still get the point.
1339220652444643334 2020-12-16 22:47:39 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Maybe we should sell California to China for whatever money we owe them.  That would get rid of Pelosi, Swalwell, Mad Max, Schiff, Newsom, and others - plus 55 liberal electoral votes.  Damn!  Would it be worth it?
1339220142958362624 2020-12-16 22:45:38 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @MyTeresadampier That would be awesome.  It would be like leaving Joe and the DNC a little stink bomb on the way out.
1339217033515307009 2020-12-16 22:33:16 +0800 <oldguy_steve> They should put Dominion in charge of sending out the COVID relief checks.  We would all be millionaires!
1339211302590242819 2020-12-16 22:10:30 +0800 <oldguy_steve> China leads the world in jailing journalists.  You might think MSM would pay attention.  https://t.co/uPemQ7nuET

1339208975049314305 2020-12-16 22:01:15 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Politicians don't give a crap about party lines.  Politicians care about getting re-elected.  A single term would correct that flaw.
1339208400647831553 2020-12-16 21:58:58 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The Los Angeles District Attorney interviews a shoplifter.  LA DA:  Why did you steal that 4K Ultra-HD flat-screen TV?  Theif:  Because I am poor, I can't afford one, and my kids need to watch Nickelodeon so they'll learn English.  LA DA:  Oh, no problem then.  You NEEDED it.
1339206683013251079 2020-12-16 21:52:09 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @RichSementa @LadyRoyMustang They will probably rename the school for the guy that invented the gay bathhouses that used to be in the Castro District.  https://t.co/rneZesWvcn
1339205283801755649 2020-12-16 21:46:35 +0800 <oldguy_steve> China doesn't want to co-exist.  China wants to dominate.  They have the idea that they're the superior race.  If that's so, why do they have to copy steal our technology instead of inventing their own?  https://t.co/kPEDerS4Wk
1339203243109277697 2020-12-16 21:38:29 +0800 <oldguy_steve> We need to un-elect every single career politician from office and start new with dedicated, patriotic individuals who want to put forth effort DOING the job, not just working to KEEP the job.  Then we vote in single terms for all of them. We will save billions in campaign costs.
1339026694489849860 2020-12-16 09:56:56 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @Glory_Infidel Running or not?
1338918641308340224 2020-12-16 02:47:34 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I have 6 passes to the Biden inauguration.  Only 24 were issued.  Who would like to go?
1338917785011847168 2020-12-16 02:44:10 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @JoeBiden They don't need your help in Georgia, Joe... they already know how to cheat.
1338917595236352001 2020-12-16 02:43:25 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Giving Joe Biden the keys to the Oval Office is like giving a monkey a gun.  https://t.co/2ZLEilRNGV
1338916628591853568 2020-12-16 02:39:34 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @mrdeplorable I was getting off a plane in an unfamiliar airport and I had to pee like a two-peckered billy goat. I had been holding it through approach and landing. Once I was off the plane, I hurried into the restroom. I looked around and didn't see a urinal. I was able to sneak out unseenðŸ¤£
1338888305815875586 2020-12-16 00:47:02 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @seanhannity No, Nancy... YOU are the existential threat to our way of life, you dried-up old prune.
1338888102849335296 2020-12-16 00:46:13 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @JoeBiden You'll never be president for me, pal.  Ain't gonna happen.
1338887364031102976 2020-12-16 00:43:17 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @slicknick52 I mentioned to one of my grandkids that I'm getting old.  They said, present tense, grandpa, you ARE old.  Smartass kids.
1338886986271113216 2020-12-16 00:41:47 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Our elected officials have become the exact fears from which our Founding Fathers sought to protect future generations.  That goes for officials in BOTH parties.  If Americans don't stand up for themselves, nobody else is going to do it for them.  https://t.co/wAg8x6fxtp
1338885731524079618 2020-12-16 00:36:48 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Today is Bill of Rights Day â€” Just four years after the Constitution was written and signed, James Madison wrote ten amendments in order to further limit the specific powers of the federal government and better protect individual rights and liberties.  https://t.co/kkrfZJWK9W
1338881818095841280 2020-12-16 00:21:15 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @lynnriley14 Yeah, and if that happens this American will be staying at home, hungry, sober, and broke.
1338881259833970694 2020-12-16 00:19:02 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I saw a news clip of Biden shuffling off the stage after his speech the other night.  He's definitely showing signs of advanced aging.
1338880808044490753 2020-12-16 00:17:14 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @FoxytailRedhead And I always said that religion needs to be taught at home, not at school.  Now, instead, we're teaching civics and home and you learn about Islam in school.
1338860569323978757 2020-12-15 22:56:49 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @no_silenced That information allows the government to funnel disproportionate amounts of money into communities that have a high population of a particular minority.
1338858038837477381 2020-12-15 22:46:45 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @LikeFineWine63 That's something the Chinese would have for dinner.
1338856899849043968 2020-12-15 22:42:14 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Show me the article in the US Constitution that says the government has the power to close your legally-run business and destroy your livelihood?  https://t.co/f3QAayZOcr
1338856152533123074 2020-12-15 22:39:16 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Not reporting a newsworthy event is just as heinous as reporting something that didn't happen.  Our news media does both.
1338855731315888139 2020-12-15 22:37:35 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @MajorPatriot Biden probably has COVID and will check out before the inauguration.
1338855003918745600 2020-12-15 22:34:42 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Most college graduates in America couldn't tell you the difference between a democracy and a republic.
1338854507283804160 2020-12-15 22:32:43 +0800 <oldguy_steve> We also need to start educating American kids in subjects like civics so they understand their rights under the Constitution and to appreciate and protect them.  It's sad when a naturalized citizen knows more about our government than someone who grew up here.
1338854051908227072 2020-12-15 22:30:55 +0800 <oldguy_steve> It is in the interest of the United States to help educate kids in countries like Guatemala and Honduras. A child educated today is a tyrant or terrorist we won't have to deal with tomorrow.  However, we need to help educate them in their own home country.  https://t.co/Qylzg5Bjxu
1338853104243023872 2020-12-15 22:27:09 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @no_silenced Roger that!  Illegal immigration is responsible for draining our social service resources including schools.  American kids are slowed down while teachers deal with a language barrier.  In many cases, American kids are the minority in a school.
1338697835575832577 2020-12-15 12:10:10 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @BCJonah1 Lyndon Johnson was later elected to the presidency.
1338697220137218049 2020-12-15 12:07:43 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Okay, historians name all of the US Presidents who were not elected into the office.  I will throw out the first one:  Gerald Ford.
1338695039220731905 2020-12-15 11:59:03 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If California recalls Gavin Newsom, it will be the first step in toppling the Newsom, Pelosi, Brown, J. Paul Getty ultra-liberal political corruption dynasty.
1338693189679472640 2020-12-15 11:51:42 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Does the possibility of Kamala Harris having the nuclear launch codes keep you up at night?
1338692986914271232 2020-12-15 11:50:54 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If student loans were not exempt from bankruptcy you would see lenders very carefully qualifying each student and verifying that their field of study would actually produce sufficient income to pay back the loan.  Problem solved.
1338664907479212032 2020-12-15 09:59:19 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Strengthen our conservative network by following these fine patriots.
1338664569225396224 2020-12-15 09:57:59 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @textdeplorable Hillary doesn't look any better even with that mask.
1338557912487141376 2020-12-15 02:54:10 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @FoxytailRedhead It's like walking into a restaurant and having a meal, then showing a card from the government saying you're broke so you don't have to pay.  The government has no authority to do that.
1338548635068338176 2020-12-15 02:17:18 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @PolitiKurd @nevrsalty As the ancient Chinese proverb goes, Ho lee chit!!!
1338511176745938944 2020-12-14 23:48:27 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Remember, when small businesses go bankrupt, creditors don't get paid.  When renters are evicted, landlords don't get paid.  When homeowners are foreclosed upon, lenders don't get paid.  It's not just the little guy that's losing money over the unnecessary shutdowns.
1338509135646576640 2020-12-14 23:40:20 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @seanhannity No, Al, we need to get rid of corruption and cheating in our elections.  The electoral college is just fine and has been for over two centuries.  No go invent something... maybe the wheel?
1338476618570899457 2020-12-14 21:31:08 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @lawyer4laws The Biden family is corrupt, compromised, and beholden to the Chinese.
1338473666011488256 2020-12-14 21:19:24 +0800 <oldguy_steve> When you see something like this, thank a Democrat.  They put Pelosi in charge of the House.  https://t.co/HtXuaeMJwA
1338472644329394178 2020-12-14 21:15:20 +0800 <oldguy_steve> First, we give those who can't afford a college education a loan that they can't afford to pay back.  Then we cancel the debt, thereby giving them an advantage over those who knew better and practiced restraint.
1338472085656535045 2020-12-14 21:13:07 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @VicTrumper It's an attempt to "normalize" mixed-race or same-sex relationships.  It's been going on for years.  Not that there's anything wrong with either of those provided the individuals are consenting adults, but we don't need it shoved down our throats either.
1338462450543255553 2020-12-14 20:34:50 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Next month's senate runoff in Georgia is crucial to civil liberties.  If the Dems win, expect legislation that will remove your ability to own a weapon like the AR-15.  Joe Biden has already said they're coming after them along with high-capacity magazines.

1338458566638751744 2020-12-14 20:19:24 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @Neen_Katzmann @TommyforTrump Damn!  I was watching it when it went down and wanted me to sign in.  At least I know what it is.
1338124177757224960 2020-12-13 22:10:39 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @textdeplorable Man or woman?  The only way to tell is to roll it in flour and look for the wet spot.
1338123361067528192 2020-12-13 22:07:25 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Joe Biden couldn't possibly live long enough to spend all the money he's raking in.
1338121705798082560 2020-12-13 22:00:50 +0800 <oldguy_steve> A suitcase containing twenty-three missing ballots was found behind a cabinet in a storeroom at the Notre Dame all-girls high school in Baltimore.  This proves that Nancy Pelosi really was the 1958 homecoming queen.  https://t.co/0Yc2TCtOyM

1338095199898124288 2020-12-13 20:15:30 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Hunter Biden did not disclose $400,000 in income from Burisma on his tax returns.  It's easy to miss $400K when you have millions coming in from China, Iran, and other countries.
1338094431065403393 2020-12-13 20:12:27 +0800 <oldguy_steve> It's amazing how a little pandemic turned all of our politicians into epidemiologists.

1338092533780369409 2020-12-13 20:04:55 +0800 <oldguy_steve> According to Democrats, black lives stopped mattering on November 4.  For the rest of us, there was never a question about anyone's life mattering.

1338080867189657603 2020-12-13 19:18:33 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I care just about as much who is on the cover of Time magazine as I do about which floral pattern is quilted on a roll of toilet paper.  https://t.co/lZVBpfWp3K
1337898029303545856 2020-12-13 07:12:01 +0800 <oldguy_steve> It doesn't say a damn thing about wearing a mask.
1337897650356506625 2020-12-13 07:10:31 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @jessiprincey Sounds like DC needs to start enforcing the law.  If I were to assault someone for no reason, I am sure that I would be spending some time in jail.  Why not them?
1337896381223034880 2020-12-13 07:05:28 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @AlexMussio The President nominates a replacement for the Vice President.
1337825704285630467 2020-12-13 02:24:38 +0800 <oldguy_steve> So see if thinking about this doesn't keep you up:  We all know Joe won't finish his first term.  Kamala takes over.  She names Hillary as VP.  Oops.  We all know how that ends, right?
1337786095275143169 2020-12-12 23:47:14 +0800 <oldguy_steve> As soon as Joe Biden strokes out, has a grabber, or trips over his dog and breaks his neck, Kamala Harris will take his place and the media will bill her as America's sweetheart.
1337784123927085059 2020-12-12 23:39:24 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @IHearTheShofar The buyback the Dems have in mind will be mandatory.  Certain guns will be deemed illegal and owners will be given a period of time to turn them in for the buyback amount. Expect this legislation to start with the next congressional session. I will buy you a beer if it doesn't.
1337781808537034753 2020-12-12 23:30:12 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The thing about politicians is that their number one priority is to get re-elected.  That supersedes voting for what's good for their constituents or defending the choices that the American people made.  Get re-elected at all costs.
1337781264229703681 2020-12-12 23:28:02 +0800 <oldguy_steve> No matter what he accomplishes during his time in office, Joe Biden will always be perceived as an illegitimate president whose party put him in power through fraud, suppression, add deceit.  Happy presidency, Mr. Biden.
1337637731162234881 2020-12-12 13:57:41 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @56Marcitos He would need the support of the military in order to do that.  I don't think he has that support.
1337637165094727680 2020-12-12 13:55:26 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @IHearTheShofar Stop them from a gun buyback program. Mass amnesty at the cost of the demise of our social programs like Social Security and Medicare. Giving away American energy independence.  I could go on and on but I'm out of characters.
1337553170138972163 2020-12-12 08:21:40 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @IHearTheShofar I've been in other countries where it's happened in less time than that.  If the Dems get the Senate, there will be absolutely nothing that can stop them. Not a scare tactic, just a fact.
1337550499818553344 2020-12-12 08:11:04 +0800 <oldguy_steve> It sounds like all legal remedies have been exhausted.

1337420514231418880 2020-12-11 23:34:33 +0800 <oldguy_steve> How do you feel about Don Lemon and Anderson Cooper picking the President of the United States?
1337419653111402502 2020-12-11 23:31:08 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Hey, Fang Fang, doesn't a spy in China get locked up and, if they're lucky, deported?  If they're not lucky, they get a sham trial and a long sentence to a forced labor camp.
1337405073089986561 2020-12-11 22:33:11 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @Michael31093553 Of course, you don't have any concerns about Swalwell, Nancy, you put him on one of the most sensitive, classified committees in Congress.  You, ma'am, are the epitome of corruption.

1337402068751958022 2020-12-11 22:21:15 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If an adversary were to deliver a nuclear weapon in one of our cities, the result would be hundreds of thousands dead, many more sick or dying, the economy in shambles, and a breakdown of law and order. Isn't' that pretty much what happened with COVID-19?

They are close duplicates that even have the 3M logo.  It's bad enough that the bastards gave us a killer virus, now they're flooding the market with fake masks.  https://t.co/uC5DlJbygB

1337050800141557761 2020-12-10 23:05:26 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Whenever there is a tax investigation, there's usually something behind it.  Money laundering.  Illegal income.  Racketeering.  Since Hunter was stupid enough to abandon a laptop full of incriminating evidence at a repair shop, I am sure he left a trail of evidence.

He felt the need to soften the blow by acknowledging the investigation a little at a time.  I am sure all the information that's being released is being managed by Democrat Party operatives.  https://t.co/gHnZ2PM30h

1336825769734012928 2020-12-10 08:11:15 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Now that his daddy has been "elected" Hunter finally admits that he's being investigated for tax issues.  Is that all?  What about the foreign kickbacks, underage girls, and other evidence on his laptop?
1336730526946750464 2020-12-10 01:52:47 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Just think about it, your state held an honest election with no glitches or claims of fraudulent activity. Another state, with more electoral votes, cheated like a losing cardplayer.  Their results completely overwhelmed yours, totally disenfranchising you. Yeah, I would sue too.
1336729805887139840 2020-12-10 01:49:55 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Sadly, that fart is probably the most significant achievement of Eric Swalwell's political career.

1336690774067404800 2020-12-09 23:14:49 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The term "out of an abundance of caution" means someone in charge doesn't have a clue how to manage the problem so they just take the easiest approach.

Everything in your home, office, or business got there by truck.  With retail going online, the demand is even greater.  Plus, you can own your own business or be an employee - your choice.
1336683333913231361 2020-12-09 22:45:15 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @Logic_Only_Plz @Arapahoman15 To compound the problem, the cost of medical, legal and other professional services reflect student loan debt. If one could discharge student loans through bankruptcy, you would see lenders pay real close attention to what someone studied and analyze their ability to pay back.
1336682767598247936 2020-12-09 22:43:00 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @Logic_Only_Plz @Arapahoman15 I believe that one of the reasons that tuition is so high is because the money is available from the student loan program.  You can't sell something for more money than your customers have - unless they can borrow to pay for it.  If student loans went away, tuition would drop.
1336441286342049792 2020-12-09 06:43:27 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The Democrats are squealing for a mask mandate.  When you mandate something you can't enforce it's like coming to a battle of the wits unarmed.

1336313443259858944 2020-12-08 22:15:27 +0800 <oldguy_steve> In the Georgia Senate runoff elections next month, voters won't be voting for the best-qualified candidate.

The same goes for college.  Watch how fast the cost of a degree goes down once the government stops subsidizing colleges with student loans.

1334835421239361536 2020-12-04 20:22:19 +0800 <oldguy_steve> When asked about his foot, Joe told the reporter, "Well, I heard a woman's scream from a bar as I was walking by.  When I entered, there were six bikers, one-percenters, one of them was named Corn Pop. They unleashed a 110-pound pit bull and when I picked him up by the collar..."
1334834566117265412 2020-12-04 20:18:55 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If Joe Biden can't keep a simple little story about a sprained ankle straight, how the hell is he going to manage as president?

1334485621683838978 2020-12-03 21:12:20 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Americans willingly gave up their property rights to HOAs.  It's not hard to believe that they gave up their civil rights to a corrupt government.

1334179332508422145 2020-12-03 00:55:15 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The vaccine is only temporary.  The Democrats are already working with the Chinese on COVID 23.

1334159083167858688 2020-12-02 23:34:47 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If Joe Biden were to sell his soul to the Devil it's unlikely that he would get more than five bucks.

1334155706425954305 2020-12-02 23:21:22 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Historical fact in 2023:  At the turn of the 21st Century, America was energy independent and free from the political influence of other oil-producing countries, especially in the Middle East...  ...then the Democrats and their Green New Deal came along.
1334154801853022209 2020-12-02 23:17:46 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Something to remember about the FBI.  There are field agents, who are overwhelmingly honest, apolitical, and carry out their duties with honor.    Then there are the bureaucrats at the top of the organization.

And the results of the presidential election are not disputed.
1334152781893038080 2020-12-02 23:09:45 +0800 <oldguy_steve> One of the greatest achievements of Donald Trump as President was to reinvigorate an apathetic population's interest in how their government is elected and run.  And then Democrats discouraged people by demonstrating that their vote doesn't count.
1334151880168013826 2020-12-02 23:06:10 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @1TPatriot @QuantumGoof "...vain and aspiring men or women."  There.  Fixed that for ya, Sam.
1334151534804832257 2020-12-02 23:04:47 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Presidential leadership means coming up with a plan and organizing people and resources to execute that plan flawlessly.  It doesn't mean carrying out instructions devised and handed down from some faceless puppetmaster or left-wing special interest.
1334150265209901058 2020-12-02 22:59:45 +0800 <oldguy_steve> It's a good thing that Congress doesn't have to approve the vaccine.  Nancy Pelosi would be tacking on money for Democrat campaign donors and liberal causes like the Kennedy Center and Planned Parenthood.
1334149937823502338 2020-12-02 22:58:27 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If Joe Biden had to deal with a pandemic under the same conditions that President Trump did, the vaccine would have taken years, not months.  It would have been tied up in the CDC, FDA, and delayed while the Biden family figured out how to make a few bucks off each dose.
1334149381868535808 2020-12-02 22:56:14 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Operation Warp Speed yielded one of the most remarkable scientific achievements of our lifetime.  The vaccine was delivered in record time, bypassing bureaucratic overregulation, geared to save lives. Credit goes to President Trump for the leadership that made this possible.
1334137859876421634 2020-12-02 22:10:27 +0800 <oldguy_steve> So the most popular activities in senior care centers in the year 2060 and beyond will be aging Millennials trying to figure out what each other's tattoos used to be.
1334133517442138113 2020-12-02 21:53:12 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @realTrumpForce You're wrong.  The biased media is America's worst virus.

1333838282883403776 2020-12-02 02:20:02 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Was I imagining things or did Hillary Clinton say that Joe Biden should never concede, under any circumstances, if he were to lose the election?
1333780063293042688 2020-12-01 22:28:42 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @JSWilder2 If they get on the train because they want to, fine.  It's when the government orders them to board the train that the problem occurs.
1333765907168956418 2020-12-01 21:32:27 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @Zegdie Actually, it was because they didn't think they had to.

1333762953082929152 2020-12-01 21:20:42 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @JoeBlack04156 You call it pessimism.  I call it realism.  ðŸ˜‚
1333762647297118208 2020-12-01 21:19:29 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @richard_g95 I agree.  Our criminal justice system needs serious reform.  Prosecutors take cases on the likelihood of conviction, not on fairness.  Defense is based upon the ability to pay for legal representation.  Most cases are plea-bargained down whether or not the accused is guilty.
1333760191838314496 2020-12-01 21:09:44 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I know it would take forever to get the results, but maybe future elections should be in person, on paper, and counted by hand - with observers from both parties observing the count.
1333759743387582464 2020-12-01 21:07:57 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The fact that any group or department is of a single race or gender should be purely coincidental, not intentional. Sex and gender are irrelevant. Individuals chosen for a job should be selected based on merit and competence ONLY. Anything else is systemic racism/sexism.
1333758480436453376 2020-12-01 21:02:56 +0800 <oldguy_steve> George Washington warned us about political parties.  ...just sayin'
1333757610990866432 2020-12-01 20:59:29 +0800 <oldguy_steve> We can recount and inspect all we want... The Democrats had this thing planned out long in advance and it's going to be damn near impossible to find hard evidence that they cheated.  Circumstantial evidence is overwhelming but nothing that will hold up in court.
1333756621449699328 2020-12-01 20:55:33 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Your elected political heroes in Congress will be going on recess without a COVID relief bill.  I think Nancy is waiting to see if she gets a Democrat majority in the Senate to shove through her "all or nothing" bill.  Meanwhile, businesses fail and citizens go bankrupt.
1333756053721235458 2020-12-01 20:53:17 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Joe Biden just named his all-female White House communications team.  Oh, how clever.  What an accomplishment.  An entire communications staff that is sans penis.
1333747579117473792 2020-12-01 20:19:37 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Can you believe #Catturd is trending?  What's that smell?  ðŸ¤£
1333747169086435328 2020-12-01 20:17:59 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If Biden takes office, you will see billions of dollars go to bail out mismanaged blue states, California in particular.  I wonder what happens to California when they max out their Uncle Sam credit card?
1333510819452096512 2020-12-01 04:38:49 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @JackPosobiec I was a smart ass in school.  I would have answered that it depends on how many pages were left in the book.
1333505872782270464 2020-12-01 04:19:10 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Some California mega-churches are rebranding themselves as strip clubs so that they can stay open for Sunday services.  There are days when I feel like I fell asleep on the bus and woke up on the wrong planet.

1333406436701872130 2020-11-30 21:44:02 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Communism can't take hold in a vibrant economy.  It depends on mass poverty and social unrest in order to take hold.  What you're about to see is the collapse of the American economy.

1333405352855932928 2020-11-30 21:39:44 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Joe Biden has released his three-point master plan for defeating the COVID pandemic:  1. Wear a mask.  2. Social distance.  3. Close everything down.

1333398181023866881 2020-11-30 21:11:14 +0800 <oldguy_steve> America should always be a beacon of hope for those who need refuge... as long as they're self-supporting, willing to assimilate, law-abiding, and don't try to smother our culture with whatever they just left.

1333396385735925761 2020-11-30 21:04:06 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Regardless of who won the election, we deserve to have confidence that the vote was fair and accurate.
1333395466243899393 2020-11-30 21:00:27 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @PiamentaShimon @veytia_jorge That's something that calls for an extra-large can of Raid.
1333394063966543875 2020-11-30 20:54:52 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @JoeBiden Wrong.  We're Americans.  You're a treasonous opportunist that wanted the presidency so bad that you sold out your country for it.
1333173968019156992 2020-11-30 06:20:17 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @j_bulmer Because there is apparently a leak, which means reporters should be all over this, you know, like when Kim Kardashian changes hair color.
1333171308994019328 2020-11-30 06:09:43 +0800 <oldguy_steve> So why am I not hearing anything about the supposed raid on a CIA facility in Germany by US Special Forces except for a few tweets and retweets on Twitter.  Did it actually happen?
1333170903924887553 2020-11-30 06:08:07 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @SaraCarterDC @IngrahamAngle Yeah, and if we gave up sex there would be a dramatic decrease in STDs too, Fauci.
1333170455910354945 2020-11-30 06:06:20 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The simple fact that there are so many claims of irregularities in the 2020 presidential election justifies a very close nonpartisan look into each state where there's a claim.  Not doing so casts doubt on the legitimacy of the outcome.  It's in the interest of both parties.

1332074759430021121 2020-11-27 05:32:26 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Wait until Biden takes office and the stock market crashes, turning 401Ks into worthless paper. Many retirement plans will be crushed and money that people worked all their lives for will evaporate. The only ones happy will be illegals on Medicare - while it lasts.
1332073219285651456 2020-11-27 05:26:18 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @RealMiniAOC @Michael1233927 The spelling.
1332073152063500288 2020-11-27 05:26:02 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @Acosta Hey, Blowjob, you did nothing but harass the Presiden for his entire term.  Don't talk to me about convenience.  If you were a real reporter, you would be all over Biden's many scandals.
1332072883745550337 2020-11-27 05:24:58 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @Joe_Kamal_ People will sacrifice their freedom for safety.  Now they sacrifice their privacy for convenience.  A belt clip or a wrist strap would work just as well and you could take it off when you didn't want to be tracked.
1332016941674897408 2020-11-27 01:42:41 +0800 <oldguy_steve> You know what?  I am going to decide how many people are around my table for Thanksgiving or any other meal, not some socialist government official.
1332016486416670722 2020-11-27 01:40:52 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @DrBiden Oh, stuff it you sanctimonious fake. You haven't got a clue how American's live, less on how their families celebrate.  Stay in Delaware for good.
1332016024393191424 2020-11-27 01:39:02 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @KAG45Patriot No, but it would keep illegals from getting absentee ballots and selling them to whoever's buying.
1331962347640946688 2020-11-26 22:05:44 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Whatever happened to tar and feathering?  It used to be a very effective way of handling corrupt politicians.  https://t.co/iRzq2LEpKY

1331753006241464321 2020-11-26 08:13:54 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @Joe_Kamal_ The Libertarian Party is as close as you'll get, with the exception that they are pro-abortion rights.  Other than that, they're constitutional conservatives.
1331620921593847808 2020-11-25 23:29:02 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @skulltzy I agree with Fauci... Let's sacrifice Fauci!  ðŸ˜‚
1331619385602056193 2020-11-25 23:22:56 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Democrats forget... it's your country.  It's YOUR money.  Imagine the impact of adding 11 million people all at once to the Medicare and Social Security rolls.  https://t.co/hLz1WFyRGV
1331618711296385024 2020-11-25 23:20:15 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @VicTrumper I raised four kids without seatbealts.  I still do that.
1331475971497545736 2020-11-25 13:53:03 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @BKPJDP I've been here almost 12 years and suddenly I am losing more followers than I'm gaining.
1331475595755077633 2020-11-25 13:51:34 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If the GOP wasn't able to win in 2020 with a rock-solid incumbent candidate, forewarning of election fraud, and an opposition candidate who's a blithering idiot, what makes you think they could win in 2024?
1331371226460160001 2020-11-25 06:56:50 +0800 <oldguy_steve> What are the odds that Biden nominates this "guy" Surgeon General?  https://t.co/OfmzxXoY4o
1331369734101581824 2020-11-25 06:50:54 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @PiamentaShimon He's cute... as long as someone else is buying his Alpo.
1331369596020932608 2020-11-25 06:50:21 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If you think you're sick, stay home. If you are at high risk and vulnerable, stay home. Out of courtesy to others, wear a mask when you go out.  Beyond that, STFU and quit telling me what to do.
1331369079077175299 2020-11-25 06:48:18 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Thanksgiving has been a national holiday in this country since 1789 when it was declared by our first president, George Washington.  I will be damned if I'll let some dorky little Democrat keep me or my family from celebrating.
1331366019273658368 2020-11-25 06:36:09 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I wonder what Hunter Biden's going rate for access to his daddy is now?
1331365208544055296 2020-11-25 06:32:55 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Notice how when you go to like one of the President's tweets on fraud, there is now an extra notification that pops up telling you to reconsider because the claim is disputed.  Twitter really wants to suppress the fact that there was cheating and manipulation in this election.  https://t.co/tg03p4Cp0b
1331244201271390208 2020-11-24 22:32:05 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Fraud in our elections will go away only after we reform campaign financing.  Take the wealthy/corporate donor out of the election process and you'll get a whole lot closer to a clean election. Limit how much can be spent, how much can be donated, and who can donate.  https://t.co/NrTERIW1WG
1331040463013363712 2020-11-24 09:02:30 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I wonder what they were fighting over?
1331039284690731009 2020-11-24 08:57:49 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden The first challenge you will face is the knowledge that you didn't win the election.  It was commandeered by Democrats through cheating and fraud.
1331038842753744898 2020-11-24 08:56:04 +0800 <oldguy_steve> For those who think the President is being obstinate by not conceding, keep in mind the harassment that he endured throughout his transition and all throughout his presidency from the Democrats and the media.
1330910469826048001 2020-11-24 00:25:57 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Finish this sentence:  Last night I dreamed that Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, AOC, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Cuomo, Maxine Waters, Adam Schiff, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib, and were all traveling to a meeting on the same plane and it...
1330908534297399296 2020-11-24 00:18:16 +0800 <oldguy_steve> It's not that China has caused the death of hundreds or thousands of Americans and adversely impacted our economy, they have impacted our culture in ways nobody thought possible.
1330908181736820736 2020-11-24 00:16:52 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @GolfingJohn_ @no_silenced clickbait
1330907845974401025 2020-11-24 00:15:32 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Any future voting machines should be required to be manufactured in the United States under government contract by US-owned companies. There should be inspections throughout the manufacturing process and the commented software code should be provided to the FEC.
1330906453654130690 2020-11-24 00:10:00 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @no_silenced It's too damn bad they aren't as conscientious about who gets to vote.
1330905837745831937 2020-11-24 00:07:33 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The word "whisperers", in Russian "ÑˆÐµÐ¿Ñ‚ÑƒÐ½Ñ‹" was used by the Soviets to describe those who informed on their neighbors for minor violations like hoarding supplies or making anti-government comments.
1330902937644662784 2020-11-23 23:56:01 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @lori8288 @dcexaminer I didn't even notice that.  I hope it wasn't an expensive one.
1330617899258572800 2020-11-23 05:03:23 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If you don't think that Biden owes Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren mega favors for letting him with the primary, then you ain't black.  Or Cherokee either.
1330516071074426881 2020-11-22 22:18:45 +0800 <oldguy_steve> When democracy fails, revolution soon prevails.  Sorry, Democrats, you can't cheat at revolution.
1330515156581793792 2020-11-22 22:15:07 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Which is the bigger threat to the wellbeing of Americans, COVID-19 or the Biden/Harris administration?
1330514738644717571 2020-11-22 22:13:28 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @IMCarson1 @SalesDiva John F. Kennedy stood up to Nikita Khrushchev and the Soviet Union.  Joe Biden would have asked them for a payoff and leased them space in Kansas for their missiles.
1330512272163287046 2020-11-22 22:03:40 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @SebGorka @CrazyDo99917732 Vulgar.  The victims of the Holocaust were innocent men, women, and CHILDREN who we systematically murdered by an evil government. George Floyd was a convicted criminal high on drugs.  There is no comparison whatsoever.
1330511053147422720 2020-11-22 21:58:49 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @Disinformation1 Exactly.  Obama gutted the space program and we had to hitch rides with the Russians to get to the ISS.
1330334826667315201 2020-11-22 10:18:33 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Due to the recent damage, and lack of funding for repair, the world acclaimed Mt. Arecibo observatory, which was a point of pride for America, will be demolished.  Not to worry.  There's plenty of money to put our 12+ million illegal aliens on Medicare.  https://t.co/rxvnWUAeef
1330167494041071623 2020-11-21 23:13:38 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If you think Biden's VP choice made you barf, wait until you see his cabinet picks.  Who do you think will get what position?
1330161061065003011 2020-11-21 22:48:04 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @TheyCallMeTomO1 Yeah, it sure is.  La Jolla is too damn close to Mexico.
1330160388340637704 2020-11-21 22:45:24 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The media, CIA, FBI, and other deep state entities hated Donald Trump so much that they conspired and cheated to win the election.  The problem is once you cheat and win, it's hard to stop cheating in the future.  It's no longer "We the People."
1330157470438871043 2020-11-21 22:33:48 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Joe Biden is a cuckold.  He allowed Hillary and the Clinton machine to steal his 2016 presidential run, which was his as a sitting vice president.  Cuckolds are weak and should never be in a position of leadership.
1330156635428360195 2020-11-21 22:30:29 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @atensnut Joe should as hid son Hunter for money.  Or maybe China.

1329943737875644416 2020-11-21 08:24:30 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @MsGrinningSoul Tell me about it.  I am very familiar with the US Postal Service.  The union for the rank-and-file workers makes their jobs bulletproof.  When they get a raise, of course, management gets a raise.  Personal incentive doesn't exist in most areas of the organization.
1329788203843260417 2020-11-20 22:06:28 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @MsGrinningSoul We are already in a situation where middle-class Americans can't afford to buy a new made-in-America car.  One of the reasons is union wages for unskilled factory workers.  Another is the ludicrous safety regulations that drive up prices.
1329515273263562753 2020-11-20 04:01:57 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @Jim_Jordan If Trump had won the election you can bet that Congress would investigate, and investigate, and investigate...
1329442241371381761 2020-11-19 23:11:44 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Joe Biden is one of the most corrupt politicians in recent history.  Even his "cancer initiative" was an excuse to rake in millions and pay out nothing.  No grants.  No research.  Just salaries to line the pockets of his cronies.  https://t.co/mxE8OPwKJg
1329438913715441667 2020-11-19 22:58:31 +0800 <oldguy_steve> We already have Americans who work a 40 hour week living in homeless camps and Joe Biden wants to raise the refugee cap from 15,000  to 125,000 and grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens.  https://t.co/VA57zIKaTa

1329139448144044033 2020-11-19 03:08:33 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The US has never defaulted on a debt.  But I wonder what would happen if ALL nations affected by the Chinese Corona VIrus were to voluntarily default on their debt to China?  https://t.co/E3aRa4OCt7

1329137033202204672 2020-11-19 02:58:57 +0800 <oldguy_steve> For 2024, the Democrats plan on a new voting methodology that will be quick, convenient, save money, and relieve the burden on the US Postal Service:  Voting by email.  What could possibly go wrong?  https://t.co/obiaveWF0X

1329119227358318593 2020-11-19 01:48:12 +0800 <oldguy_steve> What's next, mandating webcams in every room in your home to make sure you're wearing a mask?
1329119042641088512 2020-11-19 01:47:28 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The ONLY reason I can think of as to why this weirdo got elected mayor of Chicago is that nobody else wanted the job.  https://t.co/GkN1BVLR0T
1329117834887143425 2020-11-19 01:42:40 +0800 <oldguy_steve> It's not unusual to expect Americans to turn to their leaders when something terrifying like a pandemic happens.  Leaders?  ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜…ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜…
1329042361976950784 2020-11-18 20:42:46 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I wonder why Joe Biden hasn't asked China for transition funds?  Or Hunter, he's loaded?
1329041717434089474 2020-11-18 20:40:12 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania...  https://t.co/9eQ1yNtMdZ
1328862119819763713 2020-11-18 08:46:33 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The fact that Operation Warp Speed was able to develop and produce vaccines so quickly is evidence that there is way too much bureaucratic crap going on in the FDA.  It normally takes years to develop these things because there are too many palms that need to be greased.
1328860320937328640 2020-11-18 08:39:24 +0800 <oldguy_steve> How the hell does Pennsylvania plan on enforcing a mask mandate INSIDE people's homes?  Just the idea that any government official would even consider such an absurd mandate is un-American.
1328734576366166017 2020-11-18 00:19:44 +0800 <oldguy_steve> It would be funny as hell if Joe Biden somehow found himself in a Ukrainian jail.  Do you think Seal Team Six would be willing to go in and get him out?
1328734252716879872 2020-11-18 00:18:27 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @M2Madness @rsa_cat Da Nang Dick Blumenthal is the epitome of a liar and a fake.  Why he's still in the Senate is beyond me.
1328732734341095424 2020-11-18 00:12:25 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Never before has a presidential election in the United States been so aggressively contested.  We have never had so many allegations of cheating nationwide. Even seasoned politicians, who normally shy away from such claims, are calling foul.  Where there's smoke, there's fire.
1328731721634758657 2020-11-18 00:08:23 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @Joe_Kamal_ @vetsandfriends Keep in mind that Facebook was Zuckerberg's attempt to have an online bulletin board to rate Harvard girls' appearance and sexual performance.  Only when others saw the potential for a mass communication and advertising media did Facebook take on its current form.
1328729985662676992 2020-11-18 00:01:29 +0800 <oldguy_steve> George Orwell thought that television would be the downfall of personal privacy and self-determination.  He was only half right.  Social media constitutes the other half.
1328728988747919360 2020-11-17 23:57:32 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @AlvinYo65183304 Exactly.  One color, either green or blue.
1328723449561321472 2020-11-17 23:35:31 +0800 <oldguy_steve> There is no systemic racism.  People are always going to be suspicious of, or avoid, people different from themselves. That goes away when they work or live next to someone different and find out that the differences are cosmetic or superficial. No legislation can change that.
1328382914086662144 2020-11-17 01:02:21 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If you gotta wear a mask, you may as well have some fun doing it.
1328322428146044928 2020-11-16 21:02:00 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @SJPFISH No, they will get full-ride scholarships, play football in college, get drafted by the NFL, go on to make millions of dollars a year while kneeling for the National Anthem.
1328182404289228802 2020-11-16 11:45:36 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I am calling the 2021 World Series for the Chicago Cubs.  I don't know if they will even make the playoffs but I am calling them anyway.  There... if the MSM can do it on presidential elections, I can do it on baseball.
1328181534948397058 2020-11-16 11:42:09 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @RepMikeRogers @JoeBiden The biggest threat to our country is the Democrat Party.  Second to that, it's Joe Biden.
1328097114249805827 2020-11-16 06:06:41 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Twitter doesn't want you to retweet, especially without comment.  They're afraid that it contributes to the spread of misinformation (defined as something Twitter doesn't agree with.)    Do me a  favor.  Retweet this.
1328022211286863877 2020-11-16 01:09:03 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Just when we thought that the worst thing China could give us was the Wuhan virus, they gave us Joe Biden.
1327670406518509569 2020-11-15 01:51:06 +0800 <oldguy_steve> My guess is that in less than six months into a Biden administration, Kim Jung Un will throw a little tantrum and probably launch one of his missiles to get attention.  Biden will receive a call from the defense contractors he owes favors to and it will be, "game on."
1327669768174800896 2020-11-15 01:48:34 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Does anyone remember hearing, as a child, "Eat your vegetables.  There are children starving in China?"  Times sure have changed, haven't they?
1327609869814251526 2020-11-14 21:50:33 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If you're waiting to see if you'll get another stimulus check, you can relax.  You won't.  Now Queen Nancy has upped the ante to 3.4 trillion dollars for pet projects, special interests, and Democrat donors before a single check is cut.
1327609027354787841 2020-11-14 21:47:12 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If Trump leaves office, how long do you think it will be before our next endless war?
1327608336490012673 2020-11-14 21:44:27 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Here's what you can expect if Biden is inaugurated and the Georgia senate race goes blue: - An "assault rifle" ban. - 30-50% higher gas prices. - Slavery reparations. - A packed Supreme Court. - The mother of all recessions.
1327606773662896128 2020-11-14 21:38:15 +0800 <oldguy_steve> They don't get it.  It's not that Americans mind wearing a mask.  They just don't like the government telling them what to do.
1327582019836989440 2020-11-14 19:59:53 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The same old political hacks keep floating to the top time and time again.  Don't we have anyone fresh and new and honest that can fill these positions?
1327244270131023873 2020-11-13 21:37:47 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Isn't it a great country when death doesn't keep you from participating in the democratic process?
1327243201040695296 2020-11-13 21:33:32 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Information should be classified only when it protects the national security of the United States, not the misdeeds of some politicians.  #DeclassifyEverything
1327238605253660672 2020-11-13 21:15:17 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If the Democrats are willing to pay for a fake dossier, devise a hoax about Russia interfering in our election, and trying to impeach a sitting President on trumped-up charges, don't you think they would cheat to win an election?  https://t.co/6aiBL8VgSq
1327236071877316614 2020-11-13 21:05:13 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @Thomas1774Paine @Nicamy3 Joe Biden lacks the capacity to declare dick-diddley-squat.   His masters tell him what to declare and when to declare it.
1327235602006196225 2020-11-13 21:03:21 +0800 <oldguy_steve> What are they going to do, have police count how many people enter a home?  What if you have a family of 11 or more? I suppose if you work out or grab a drink at 9:30, you're safe, yeah?  Bill de Blasio, aka, Warren Wilhelm, is an idiot and his actions are a government overreach.
1326927994707800064 2020-11-13 00:41:01 +0800 <oldguy_steve> In 2016, when Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, Democrats went out of their way to turn a proud, joyous, occasion into allegations of Russian meddling and illegitimacy.    Karma's a bitch and she never forgets.
1326920222905827328 2020-11-13 00:10:08 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Caryn Elaine Johnson, also known as Whoopi Goldberg, is a not-so-funny comedian masquerading as a political pundit.  Whatever she has to say about politics has absolutely no substance at all.  Take it with a grain of salt.  https://t.co/bMdL14YaZ3

1326904965080756224 2020-11-12 23:09:31 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @StonneJayson It is.  And for a "conduit" of free information exchange, that's a vulgar form of censorship.
1326904061287952384 2020-11-12 23:05:55 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Well, I guess if we had a flat Earth, we wouldn't have globalists, now would we?  https://t.co/7lOXY9efhP
1326901623831060481 2020-11-12 22:56:14 +0800 <oldguy_steve> if you feed someone enough crap, eventually it starts to taste like ice cream.    That's exactly what the Democrats are doing to Americans with the "President-elect" bullshit. Joe has made more appearances already as "President-elect" than he did in the entire campaign.
1326895003558293504 2020-11-12 22:29:56 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @JuliansRum @GRITS4DJT I hope so.  There are people in prison for less than he did.  Mostly, I want to see his sleazy dad exposed for what he is.

Oh, and that 3,000 sq. ft. house you paid for?  That will go to the illegal immigrant who brought 7 kids across the border.
1326550862378856456 2020-11-11 23:42:26 +0800 <oldguy_steve> How in the living hell did we allow the likes of Kamala Harris, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib to get into the highest levels of the United States government?
1326531547181182978 2020-11-11 22:25:41 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Kamala Harris will try her best to castrate and emasculate America.

1326155526900572160 2020-11-10 21:31:31 +0800 <oldguy_steve> After the last software update to Ios 14.2, the battery on my iPhone 8 only lasts about half the time it used to. It gets very little call time and used to last a good two days before it needed a charge.  Now it's only good for maybe 12 hours.  Is anyone else having this problem?
1326153284697038848 2020-11-10 21:22:36 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If you serve a turd on a dinner plate and call it meatloaf, most would object.  If you surround it with vegetables and gravy, and enough people keep telling you it's meatloaf, you may start to believe it, or at least question your senses.  MSM is surrounding Biden with veggies.
1326151244113612800 2020-11-10 21:14:29 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The networks aren't reporting stories on election fraud using the excuse that they're unfounded.  They had no problem reporting the Steele Dossier and Russia hoax, both of which were unfounded.
1326017943575040003 2020-11-10 12:24:48 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Brute force isn't leadership.  Brute force is bullying, and that's exactly what the Democrats and the media are doing to the American people.
1326015954887667712 2020-11-10 12:16:54 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Not only does the Democrat party promote a socialist ideology, but they also have no regard for the rule of law, they cheat, and they totally disregard the will of the American people.

1325930239541743616 2020-11-10 06:36:18 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Trump helping Biden with transition is like a homeowner helping a burglar load his furniture into a U-Haul.  https://t.co/NzZEexdlht
1325915566834507776 2020-11-10 05:38:00 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Twitter wants you to believe that voting by mail is safe and secure. Bullshit. Voting by mail leaves a ballot with a journey through multiple hands at the USPS on its way to be counted. Plus, there is no guarantee that the person who mails the ballot is the one who it belongs to.
1325854192389386240 2020-11-10 01:34:07 +0800 <oldguy_steve> It's one thing for cheating to go on in municipal elections.  It's been going on in places like Chicago.  People damn near expect it.  But for cheating to take place, and be accepted, in an American presidential election, that can't be allowed to happen.  https://t.co/WDrrF04RT3

1325571440242913281 2020-11-09 06:50:33 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @cannotrunfast It's a very nice letter, however, it ignores the fact that the election was rife with fraudulent votes and that the man running is way past his sell-by date. It also ignores the fact that an ambitious, uber-liberal, progressive woman is a heartbeat away from the presidency.
1325550966322597888 2020-11-09 05:29:12 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @TheyCallMeTomO1 How the hell would they know that? Do they have a hidden microphone in their bedroom?
1325550262358929408 2020-11-09 05:26:24 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @ConeBell11 No, Medicare is certainly not free. It was designed for a single pre-existing condition: age. If it weren't for Medicare, people wouldn't be able to buy insurance because nobody in their right mind would assume the risk. The only part of it that's "free" is hospitalization.
1325532034832367616 2020-11-09 04:13:58 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @helo_navy I use the VA for my healthcare.  Most of the time, it's great.
1325501306287529985 2020-11-09 02:11:52 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Congress gave American seniors a really shitty program with Medicare.  High enrollment cost, high copays, high drug prices, and a freakin' donut hole.  What makes you think a single-payer system would be any better?
1325492207642501121 2020-11-09 01:35:43 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @thehill Too bad you don't go quietly in the night, butthole.

1325486601305116672 2020-11-09 01:13:26 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Fox News is in the same business as all the other networks: Selling advertising on the public airwaves. As a business, they will do whatever gains them the most money for their airtime.  Ideology doesn't matter. Black lives don't even matter. Advertising revenue matters.
1325485704441257984 2020-11-09 01:09:52 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Remember when Obama made Biden the Cancer Czar after his son Beau died?  Did he do anything?
1325485029561020416 2020-11-09 01:07:12 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @Pasquale527 No impeachment.  Unfortunately, we have a Democrat congress.
1325428708891525122 2020-11-08 21:23:24 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Biden asks, "...give me a chance."  That would be a chance to raise our taxes, export our jobs, and take our guns, right?
1325376157022265344 2020-11-08 17:54:34 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Now that he's got his prize, supposedly, Biden calls for "unity and healing."  Let's just forget about the corruption and cheating and all just get along, right?
1325283390313017344 2020-11-08 11:45:57 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @KAG45Patriot Either that or he will stroke out.  There are rumors going around that he's got Parkinson's.  Either way, he's not going to last.  The thought of that woman in the Oval Office sickens me.
1325194677293772801 2020-11-08 05:53:26 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Do you think that the Democrat's insatiable desire for power and control is the result of a social/ideological agenda or is it about privilege and money for special interests and donors?
1325143980271570945 2020-11-08 02:31:59 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @wwdnet2 @JHester1531 Brush up on your Newspeak.
1325143789988532225 2020-11-08 02:31:14 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @ArbiterOfStupid @Rand1957 I don't think so.  The networks begin suppression polling and biased news reporting way before the election.
1325143081646108672 2020-11-08 02:28:25 +0800 <oldguy_steve> California may have 55 electoral votes but the rest of us have plastic shopping bags and soda straws.
1325137434154201101 2020-11-08 02:05:58 +0800 <oldguy_steve> In 1949, when TV was barely making a debut in American homes, a dystopian social science fiction novel by English novelist George Orwell titled "1984" predicted that television would remove human freedom and self-determination.  In 2020, the TV networks have made that a reality.
1325136083248504832 2020-11-08 02:00:36 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I thought the American people determined who was President of the United States, not the Associated Press and the television networks.
1325088175753056256 2020-11-07 22:50:14 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Isn't it ironic that the Democrats accused Russia of interfering in our election in 2016 only to mount the most massive voter fraud in US History in 2020?  The whole world is laughing its ass off.

1324934977528557568 2020-11-07 12:41:29 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Democrat strategy:  We'll just keep voting until we win.
1324934063346475009 2020-11-07 12:37:51 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Now, if California were to secede, Trump would have already won and we could all get a good night's sleep.  What say, California, you guys ready to take one for the team? ðŸ˜‚

1324717315103940608 2020-11-06 22:16:34 +0800 <oldguy_steve> For the last few days, no matter how many new followers I get, my follower count goes down.  I got one notification of 20 new followers which resulted in my count going down about 30 or so.  Is Twitter messing with me?

1324552218586931200 2020-11-06 11:20:32 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @FoxytailRedhead There has always been an aversion in America to a national ID or a citizen tracking number.  That's exactly what Social Security numbers turned out to be.  Before widespread ID theft, they were even used as driver's license numbers.  It's time to used them for voter ID.
1324489679459160064 2020-11-06 07:12:02 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @LoeWEarl They'll just do it like Russia does.  We vote but no matter who we vote for, the outcome is always the same.
1324456355864875009 2020-11-06 04:59:37 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Americans lost around 25 minutes of sleep on average on election night, according to an analysis of tens of thousands of people with health technology wearable Oura Ring.   It's the sleep I will lose AFTER the election that I'm worried about.
1324455292474552320 2020-11-06 04:55:23 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If someone is convicted of participating in or permitting voter fraud, that person should not be allowed to vote, or hold public office, or participate in an election or the political process in any way.  If you're caught counting cards in a casino, you're out for good.
1324454345341980672 2020-11-06 04:51:37 +0800 <oldguy_steve> It shouldn't be easier to track a credit card than it is to track a ballot.
1324454206971863040 2020-11-06 04:51:04 +0800 <oldguy_steve> To keep this voter fraud from happening again, we need mandatory voter ID, multiple cameras throughout counting centers observed by a centralized nonpartisan group, ballots tracked with printed with serial numbers on them, voter registration cross-referenced with SSN database.
1324414292398022656 2020-11-06 02:12:28 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @RL9631 @DD4USA Well, depending on how you look at it, he is absentðŸ˜œ.
1324413556108849153 2020-11-06 02:09:32 +0800 <oldguy_steve> A bumper sticker says, "Pray for Nancy Pelosi. Psalm 109:8."  I looked it up: May her days be short and few; may another take her place of leadership.  I want one.
1324411719527985152 2020-11-06 02:02:14 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Why would the Democrats lie, cheat, and steal to win an election?  Money.  There are billions already spent on the campaign, future billions coming from campaign donors if they win, and favors promised to powerful special interests.
1324357442826772480 2020-11-05 22:26:34 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Who will decide who's elected in 2020?
1324192098317295617 2020-11-05 11:29:33 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @StacyHerndon10 Yes.  Mine are dwindling.  I lost about 50-70 today alone, even though my notifications show that 20 people followed me.  Either they're bots that got detected, or my followers who got suspended, or Twitter is trying to deplete my followers for some reason.
1324191618484760576 2020-11-05 11:27:38 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @JoeBiden I wouldn't give you a single cent for anything you sponsored Joe.  Take the money out of your Ukraine cut, or your China cut, or your Iran cut, or...
1324191124953559040 2020-11-05 11:25:41 +0800 <oldguy_steve> How in the hell are you supposed to teach your kids to be honest and truthful and respect those around them when their government is like a bunch of hungry piranha without a single sense of decency or morality?
1324133997283168256 2020-11-05 07:38:40 +0800 <oldguy_steve> At this point in time, the fate of our nation lies with six electoral votes.
1324122818498318337 2020-11-05 06:54:15 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If it comes to it, I could accept Joe Biden as President and treat him with respect.  What I can't accept or respect is Kamala Harris.  No way.
1324122548792033281 2020-11-05 06:53:11 +0800 <oldguy_steve> People aren't voting for Biden.  They're voting against Trump - because the media has told them to.
1324024639308193792 2020-11-05 00:24:07 +0800 <oldguy_steve> First, it was hanging chad.  Now it's Sharpies.  If that's all it takes to throw an election, we shouldn't be in charge of nuclear weapons.
1323982345070759938 2020-11-04 21:36:04 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Well, I guess if Delaware can elect Joe Biden to the Senate over and over again despite multiple scandals and proven lies, then electing a transgender state senator isn't that big of a stretch, yeah?
1323979889796526081 2020-11-04 21:26:18 +0800 <oldguy_steve> When cancer does metastasize, it spreads to the organs directly next to the cancerous one.  Liberalism is the same.  Look and California and New York on your election map to see a graphic example.
1323957155968425984 2020-11-04 19:55:58 +0800 <oldguy_steve> People with full-time jobs living on the street.  Taxes so high that people are losing their homes.  Citizens and corporations leaving the state in droves.    Why does California keep voting Democrat?

1322940152067497984 2020-11-02 00:34:45 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I wonder what Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon will be doing for a living after a Trump victory on Tuesday?  CNN certainly won't be in a position of supporting them after they got it wrong twice in a row.
1322919953373175810 2020-11-01 23:14:30 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The Democrat party will likely lose big on Tuesday.  Do you think that unless they change their ideology and reject the radical left they will survive as a party?
1322918247415492611 2020-11-01 23:07:43 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Even if Joe Biden wasn't taking a cut of Hunter's money from China, Ukraine, et al, the fact that he was getting emails from the White House and flying aboard Air Force 2 is a huge security compromise.  Hunter is a drug addict, which makes him unstable and unpredictable.
1322698852982353920 2020-11-01 08:35:55 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Fauci got fame beyond anything he could have imagined when COVID hit, largely because he appeared with the President on the televised daily updates.  Do you think it went to his head the way it did with Marica Clark when she blew the OJ trial?  https://t.co/PgCt5lnswe
1322661738521661442 2020-11-01 06:08:26 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Thanks for the ride, Andrea!
1322661288833548288 2020-11-01 06:06:39 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @ASoftstar Ask Nancy Pelosi.
1322641792043425792 2020-11-01 04:49:11 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @IHearTheShofar I have the same problem lately.  I get a message saying 50 people followed me and then I look at my profile and I'm down 30.
1322601327457783808 2020-11-01 02:08:23 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Mother to Son:  Put away that crack pipe and get some clothes on.  You're NOT going out as Hunter Biden for Halloween.    And no, your sister isn't dressing like a stripper, either!  https://t.co/cadQVVVUTN
1322570354921857025 2020-11-01 00:05:19 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Nancy Pelosi is holding up the COVID relief bill simply because she thinks it will help Democrats win the election.  Meanwhile, businesses close for good, and people lose their homes.  Nancy Pelosi has no place in our Congress or in any elected office anywhere.
1322215719317069824 2020-10-31 00:36:07 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I truly believe that on January 20, 2021, President Trump will refuse to hand over power to Joe Biden.  That's because he will have won the election.
1322212550608482307 2020-10-31 00:23:32 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Dear Career Politicians,  We know Donald Trump is rough around the edges and is known for calling it like he sees it, politically correct or not.  That's because he doesn't think like you.  He thinks like us.  -  Sincerely, The American People
1322211967780622336 2020-10-31 00:21:13 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Joe:  You might be able to fool the people of Delaware for 47 years, but you can't fool the American people.
1321854905036926977 2020-10-30 00:42:22 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @IHearTheShofar They were afraid to investigate so they're posting a rumor.
1321852119549272064 2020-10-30 00:31:18 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @G_TheOriginal Is that the same bag Hunter uses to bring you your cut of the money?
1321850252081549312 2020-10-30 00:23:53 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @hcf1957 Roger that... but it still shows a remarkable recovery and a positive trend.

1321832019869921281 2020-10-29 23:11:26 +0800 <oldguy_steve> You know, a  social ideaology may give one the warm fuzzies, but if you don't have a job, you're living in a tent on the sidewalk, or you have to ration food to your kids, the warm fuzzies get cold real damn quick.
1321818019744550917 2020-10-29 22:15:48 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @coatsnancy57 Nah.  Too many rednecks with guns itching for something to shoot at.
1321817731012853760 2020-10-29 22:14:39 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @jsolomonReports If CNN refuses to run something you can bet that it's because it's true.  Let's not muck up a good string of lies with the honest truth.
1321817068614811649 2020-10-29 22:12:01 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Trump crushed the record for the largest GDP increase in US history. The third-quarter GDP is up 33.1% this morning.  Imagine where it would be without Russia, Russia, Russia, Impeachment, and all the other Democrat hoaxes.
1321816098862325760 2020-10-29 22:08:10 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @ladyquietstorm7 @realDonaldTrump I would rather that my children smoke crack or snort it off the bare ass of cheap foreign hookers and extort millions from foreign governments. - Joe Biden
1321685160597745665 2020-10-29 13:27:52 +0800 <oldguy_steve> When Joe Biden let Hillary take his run in 2016, he should have just quit and left with his name and legacy intact.  Instead, he's drug his family name through the mud, implicated his son in corruption, and become a total laughing stock to anyone with an IQ over 70.
1321676773830975489 2020-10-29 12:54:33 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Do you think Joe Biden is really a communist sympathizer or is he just playing along with whoever he thinks will line his pockets and get him elected?
1321675945145593858 2020-10-29 12:51:15 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Never have I gone to bed at night and wondered when I woke up the next morning if America would be the same free nation that our forefathers founded.  I am afraid I won't have that feeling of certainty next Tuesday.
1321504679004495873 2020-10-29 01:30:42 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @LaBonteLisa Most people go, "What the hell is that?"  Some Google it thinking it's some sort of medical specialty.
1321504164451504128 2020-10-29 01:28:39 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @bulliegirl1959 @MaryRay42617188 I wasn't talking about privacy issues.  I was talking about the fact that Americans tolerate censorship and election meddling so that they have social media like Facebook.
1321484516863561729 2020-10-29 00:10:35 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Because grandmothers all over the country want to stay in touch and see daily pictures of the grandkids, America has sold its soul to Facebook.
1321482844015767553 2020-10-29 00:03:56 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Hey Jack, how many Twitter-like companies are there in the Islamic Republic of Iran?
1321457836040183809 2020-10-28 22:24:34 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Joe Biden told the Milken Conference in 2017, where he met Tony Bobulinski, that he would not run in 2020. He'd be "in a walker," he joked.  Joe may not be in a walker but his brain sure as hell is.
1321319537963274240 2020-10-28 13:15:01 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Hey, after the Tucker Carlson interview, I hear that  #TonyBobulinski   is trending.  Let's make it take off.
1321293421416427533 2020-10-28 11:31:14 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @DSFisAddlepated I agree.  That being said, I also believe in the right to try.  If I have an illness that's going to result in certain death, I want to try anything that may prevent that death from happening, tested and proven or not.
1321226384631476224 2020-10-28 07:04:51 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @RetReaper And when those kids get their ass shot off because they didn't follow police commands and presented a threat to the cops, then it will give the whole damn community an excuse to loot the nearest designer clothing store.
1321226008075198464 2020-10-28 07:03:22 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @DrBiden And snorting coke off a hooker's ass isn't decent?  What is it with the Biden men and their nose, anyway?
1321225747231510528 2020-10-28 07:02:19 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @DSFisAddlepated Not everyone was around when the tragedy occurred with Thalidomide in the 1950s.  Thousands of children were born with very severe birth defects.

1321091775180775438 2020-10-27 22:09:58 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @chasbottom While they're stealing designer clothing, I wonder if they stop to check for sizes?
1321091002493476867 2020-10-27 22:06:54 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @SaraCarterDC I would call it, "Tales from the Toilet".
1320892828721893376 2020-10-27 08:59:26 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I used to believe that the two major parties both wanted to achieve the best for America and that they just had different ways of going about it.  Not any more.  I believe the Democrats, in particular, the radical left, want to destroy the America we know.  What do you think?
1320871606789443585 2020-10-27 07:35:06 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Jill, what's on Hunter's laptop is graphic evidence of your husband's corruption, collusion, and other illegal activity.  And yes, the American people want to know about it.
1320809765623062528 2020-10-27 03:29:22 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @HillaryClinton Why, Hillary?  The DNC sure tried to ram you through.
1320768438382456834 2020-10-27 00:45:09 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @gregolear @misticati4 With your line of thinking, slavery would still be legal.
1320766471841050624 2020-10-27 00:37:20 +0800 <oldguy_steve> In watching GMA this morning, I am convinced that they are not just biased, they are actively campaigning for Joe Biden.
1320737763809918976 2020-10-26 22:43:15 +0800 <oldguy_steve> This is the new Biden mobile.  It runs on batteries, is Green New Deal compliant, and it only makes left turns.  https://t.co/VsaHvKvZy4
1320735874053619712 2020-10-26 22:35:45 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Yesterday Joe Biden called the President George.  Everyone thought he was referring to the 43rd president.  He wasn't.  He was referring to the first.  His mind is shot.
1320578682079989762 2020-10-26 12:11:07 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @Proven_Right Good, Joe, I'm glad you feel that actively campaigning is super-spreading.  We'll see how that works for you on election day.
1320578144340897792 2020-10-26 12:08:59 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Joe Biden says that if the Presiden's tax cut goes through, Social Security and Medicare will be bankrupt by 2023.  If Social Security and Medicare go bankrupt, there's only one reason:  Congress couldn't keep their hands out of the till.
1320394741528276996 2020-10-26 00:00:12 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @missyhope1 @TheyCallMeTomO1 I know that in Southern California you didn't get into school in the 1950s without the Salk vaccine.  In the 1960s, the Sabin oral vaccine was administered right in the classroom.  I respect the rights of anti-vaxxers to not take the vaccine if that's their choice.
1320393571258695687 2020-10-25 23:55:33 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @HalseyXT Halsey, you've been a very bad girl.  ðŸ˜‚  Keep up the good work!
1320120223819649025 2020-10-25 05:49:22 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Joe Biden said we have a "dark winter" coming on. Operation Dark Winter was the code name for a senior-level bio-terrorist attack simulation conducted in 2001. It was designed to carry out a mock version of a covert and widespread smallpox attack on the United States. WTF?
1320055820004982787 2020-10-25 01:33:27 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Hunter Biden's laptop.  https://t.co/lYtfFU4ttX
1320053902906064896 2020-10-25 01:25:50 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @shellie647 Do you really think Joe would carry Delaware?
1320053619945738240 2020-10-25 01:24:43 +0800 <oldguy_steve> It was Russia, Russia, Russia. Then it was, testing, testing, testing.  Now it's cases, cases, cases.
1320052960060002304 2020-10-25 01:22:05 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Obama campaigned for Biden in Florida today.  The crowd was extremely enthusiastic and chanted "Build Back Better" over and over, all three of them.
1320052080925503488 2020-10-25 01:18:36 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I would vote for Bernie Sanders before I voted for Joe Biden.  Bernie is a slug.  Joe Biden is a viper.  I would have called Joe a rattlesnake but at least a rattler warns you before it strikes.
1320051303045713927 2020-10-25 01:15:30 +0800 <oldguy_steve> It's really hard to believe that even the accusation that one of our presidential candidates is taking money from the Chinese Communist Party isn't headline news.
1320050246034964481 2020-10-25 01:11:18 +0800 <oldguy_steve> All it took was one sentence to land me in the hospital:  "It's too late, babe.  You're already fat."
1320004402879492096 2020-10-24 22:09:08 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @LymanBay It has a lot to do with how many people you follow and how active they are.
1320004133227671554 2020-10-24 22:08:04 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @TheyCallMeTomO1 The sad part is that there are many defendants who didn't even get one fair trial.  They were railroaded or bullied into plea agreements by overzealous prosecutors and overworked public defenders.  This guy shouldn't get a second milllion-dollar trial just so lawyers can collect.
1319676962114134023 2020-10-24 00:28:00 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @Dunkmode1 That's not fair.  Maybe I should have said "serious crime".  The war on drugs was a war on civil liberties.  As a result of their being bored, legislators have made far too many things a felony.

1319670839889981440 2020-10-24 00:03:41 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Addicts don't go to prison unless they commit a crime, which may or may not be a result of their addiction.  Unless they commit a crime that keeps them from obtaining it, they are entitled to treatment.  Otherwise, they are treated like anyone else who breaks the law.
1319662032002576384 2020-10-23 23:28:41 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @PiamentaShimon Joe's not lying, he probably doesn't remember he said it.
1319661288507666432 2020-10-23 23:25:43 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @VicTrumper @ErikErikson95 That depends entirely on whose truck it is.  ðŸ˜€
1319650353365745664 2020-10-23 22:42:16 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Many seniors in our country, who have paid into Medicare all their working lives, can't afford prescription drug coverage, and the copays that go with it, for medicine that keeps them alive.  Joe biden wants to add millions of illegals to Medicare.  https://t.co/gOeFubgBWN

1319510725841149953 2020-10-23 13:27:27 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @KAG45Patriot Empathy sure as hell isn't on Hunter's laptop.
1319508588067344386 2020-10-23 13:18:57 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If you've paid into Medicare for many years, as I have, you can take comfort and pride in knowing that you will receive less coverage if Joe Biden is elected.  The pie is only so big.  If you give Biden Care to 11 million illegals, guess whose piece gets smaller.
1319507843897192448 2020-10-23 13:15:59 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Becoming a criminal is one thing.  Using your kid to help commit the crime is another - even if that kid is an adult.  Doing so shows a serious lack of character.
1319507252672229376 2020-10-23 13:13:38 +0800 <oldguy_steve> For every one of you who came to America and earned your citizenship the hard way, be advised that Joe Biden wants to GIVE citizenship to 11 million illegals.  Just like a Democrat to give away what others have worked. for.
1319506288976379904 2020-10-23 13:09:49 +0800 <oldguy_steve> C'mon, man...

1319440400524873728 2020-10-23 08:48:00 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @JustLuthien Exactly, but it protects the media from harm and harassment in their effort to inform the public.
1319439657298345985 2020-10-23 08:45:02 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @TheyCallMeTomO1 Well, he sure as hell isn't going to get anything after the debate!
1319438367122051072 2020-10-23 08:39:55 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @JoeBiden Joe, if you're going head-to-head with Donald Trump, then you're going to be showing up unarmed.
1319416244160745473 2020-10-23 07:12:00 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The First Amendment protected the press from interference from the government, from politicians, from unscrupulous lawyers - just about anyone who would get in the way of their telling the truth.  They've turned on the very hand that protected them for centuries.
1319413275155525632 2020-10-23 07:00:12 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Censorship not only kills ideas, but it will also kill a country.
1319412645972172800 2020-10-23 06:57:42 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @JoeBiden Quit pulling the "average working Joe" act.  You are as disconnected from the American worker as you can get.  The problem is, you think we're stupid enough not to see through you.  You've never had a job, Joe, and we all know that.
1319412099198537728 2020-10-23 06:55:32 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @goombafrankie @ScottBaio Just hit the retweet button without writing anything.  It will take right off.
1319390963601584128 2020-10-23 05:31:33 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Joe Biden's hissy fit, when asked about the evidence of corruption on his son's laptop, was akin to the little charade Nancy Pelosi threw when she ripped up the President's State of the Union speech.
1319390235675914242 2020-10-23 05:28:39 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @ScottBaio Scott, it's their new patch to the program.  Just hit "retweet" and you will retweet without comment.
1319348381966168064 2020-10-23 02:42:21 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I miss the days when reporters factually reported the news, actors simply entertained, athletes were patriotic, and politicians actually represented the people they were elected to represent.  I can't be the only one that feels this way.
1319338452232531968 2020-10-23 02:02:53 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I wonder what she caught him doing?  https://t.co/TUN9ww8wvP
1319273586473877512 2020-10-22 21:45:08 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @ladyquietstorm7 Hopefully, that got reported to the police and to the county attorney.  I would have made sure the state AG knew about it.  I wonder what happened with the next batch of people?
1319138117459214337 2020-10-22 12:46:50 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Social media needs to get out of the censorship business.  Let people say what's on their mind.  If it's illegal, there's a remedy for whatever it is, but free speech should never be patrolled by the likes of Facebook and Twitter.
1318965015563489282 2020-10-22 01:18:59 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @kramerreport @missyhope1 None.  There are too many copies out there.
1318964711858188288 2020-10-22 01:17:47 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Bummed out about the lockdown?  Just remember, some poor soul is quarantined with your ex.
1318964115759525888 2020-10-22 01:15:25 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Meanwhile, while your Democrat elected political heroes in Congress are bringing home steady six-digit salaries, average Americans everywhere are losing their homes, their jobs, and to make it worse, can't even get extended unemployment assistance.  Are you pissed off yet?
1318922656276598784 2020-10-21 22:30:40 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I never thought I would find myself walking into a bank, wearing a mask, and ask for money.
1318888892905390086 2020-10-21 20:16:30 +0800 <oldguy_steve> NASA just landed a spacecraft on an asteroid 200 million miles from Earth.  It will collect and return samples back to Earth.  Any yet there are those who are obsessed with who does or doesn't wear a face covering.
1318773918988005376 2020-10-21 12:39:38 +0800 <oldguy_steve> You know, even after this covid thing is over with, there are still a few people I'd like to stay at least six feet away from.
1318695614272598016 2020-10-21 07:28:29 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Oops.  They did it again.  Democrats have blocked billions in a bipartisan coronavirus relief bill to help small businesses and their workers stay on the payroll.   Democrats don't care who they hurt as long as they win.  What would you like to tell Nancy?  https://t.co/croHVqhmPd
1318693899615883264 2020-10-21 07:21:40 +0800 <oldguy_steve> At this point, if there's anyone who doesn't believe that Joe Biden is corrupt, and has implicated his family in the corruption, they're living with their head in the sand or up their @$$.  Either way, there's no way this guy should get within a mile of the White House.
1318648197091348480 2020-10-21 04:20:04 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @SanderKooi1 @JoeyaLowe Yes.  Lots of it.   Hard evidence.
1318645802307252224 2020-10-21 04:10:33 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @RussellMace2 Glad you came out of it, my friend.
1318583787614203904 2020-10-21 00:04:07 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Doesn't it anger you that ordinary citizens are going to prison for what Hunter Biden has been getting away with for years?
1318538240836521992 2020-10-20 21:03:08 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @politico If they're FORMER intelligence officers then their statement is simply their opinion.
1318385680712495104 2020-10-20 10:56:55 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I guess if you raise your kid to think there's nothing wrong with extorting money from foreign governments, then  you shouldn't be surprised when he gets drunk and leaves his computer with hard evidence where it's likely to be discovered, right?
1318385082541830145 2020-10-20 10:54:32 +0800 <oldguy_steve> So we have a pandemic and all of a sudden Dr. Fausi thinks he's in charge of public policy as if he were the President.  Did I get that right?
1318384808209260545 2020-10-20 10:53:27 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @SenSchumer Quit flapping your lips and do it.  I don't think it will work, but you can always try, Chuck.
1318268618765787137 2020-10-20 03:11:45 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Why is Twitter blocking the New York Post?  https://t.co/En2mHhkknU
1318200114456842242 2020-10-19 22:39:32 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Newsome says California can't afford to pay for extended unemployment benefits.  Don't I remember California giving stimulus money to illegal immigrants?  https://t.co/k0dIsPo46u
1318199652584353792 2020-10-19 22:37:42 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If you're waiting for federal unemployment assistance or other stimuli in response to the COVID shutdown, rest assured that you will be in the thoughts and prayers of your elected political heroes as they continue their partisan bickering. How does that make you feel?
1318198980312928257 2020-10-19 22:35:02 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Baseball used to be the national past time.  Kids were more interested in the baseball cards than they were the bubblegum they came with.  We listened to the games on our transistor radios. Look what's happened to sports since they became a commercial advertising conglomerate.
1318198364371001345 2020-10-19 22:32:35 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Why isn't Bob Woodward all over the Hunter Biden story?
1318198148838301696 2020-10-19 22:31:44 +0800 <oldguy_steve> California's Democrat governor, Gavin Newsome signed an executive order banning the sale of new gas-powered cars in California starting in 2035. Yeah, right.  That's going to help all those people sleeping in tents on the sidewalk.
1318014083472371712 2020-10-19 10:20:19 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @MSWatts47 Damn!  I got one of those.  And unlike Hunter Biden, mine says "Honorable Discharge."
1318011819831644166 2020-10-19 10:11:19 +0800 <oldguy_steve> In Russia, you see massive rallies and support of the candidate opposing Vladimir Putin.    Nevertheless, Putin always wins.  What are the chances that could happen here, bringing Biden into the White House?
1318011229466578945 2020-10-19 10:08:59 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Prediction:  Sleepy Joe will drop out of the race as the scandal deepens.  Kamalamala will run for president and pick a ringer to fill in as VP.  Is that even legal?
1318010489272631298 2020-10-19 10:06:02 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Worse yet, they don't see anything wrong with it.
1318010398713393152 2020-10-19 10:05:41 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @hrenee80 @nicklotto Worse yet, they don't see anything wrong with it.
1318010284594712576 2020-10-19 10:05:13 +0800 <oldguy_steve> At one point in my life, I signed a piece of paper pledging my life in defense of this country.  Do you really think I would let restriction of my Twitter account keep me from doing the same damn thing now?
1317971895401152513 2020-10-19 07:32:41 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @JoeBiden Just another reason why you're not qualified to be President.  If you're in a meeting in the Situation Room, I expect you to finish that meeting before you step out to take a call from anyone.  Except maybe Hunter.  He might have another $10 introduction for you.
1317847830451531777 2020-10-18 23:19:41 +0800 <oldguy_steve> What's similar about ABC News and Disney?  They both deal in fantasy.  https://t.co/Qox9St2x5c
1317844208024125441 2020-10-18 23:05:18 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Hey, Congress: Wait until those who have lost their homes and businesses have to move their families onto the streets.  You want to see acts of desperation?  Just wait.
1317843184114806791 2020-10-18 23:01:14 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I can't believe that every single day more damning evidence is being released about the Biden scandal and not a single word is being uttered by MSM.

1317831264611618817 2020-10-18 22:13:52 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @yakama717 @JoeBiden Not to mention that after being shot in the leg, the perp is disabled and will draw SSDI at the taxpayer's expense.

1317823546081517568 2020-10-18 21:43:12 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Social Worker: "I am very sorry to see that you're getting your face pounded into the sidewalk by this angry gentleman.  Please hold on for a minute while I explore his unresolved emotional issues."  https://t.co/6UU4h2y1Rr
1317812620594876416 2020-10-18 20:59:47 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Maybe we should equip Joe Biden's secret service detail with double-barrel shotguns, his weapon of choice.  Who thinks that would be fair?
1317811094384111618 2020-10-18 20:53:43 +0800 <oldguy_steve> #ChinaBitchBiden   #BidenCrimeFamily  Biden just keeps trending... help him out, folks.
1317807236110938112 2020-10-18 20:38:23 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @rleft I think we all were.  Shooting at a target you're likely to miss means a chance that bullet is going to end up somewhere you didn't intend it to.  FBI shoots to kill also.
1317650097207832576 2020-10-18 10:13:58 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Don't trade your civil liberties, like freedom of speech, for some fun and entertainment on Twitter and Facebook.  It's not worth it.  And when the right to self-expression goes away, the first to fail will be Big Tech.  The second will be the MSM.
1317649471166054402 2020-10-18 10:11:29 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I thought someone said #ChinaBitchBiden was trending?
1317649034006310912 2020-10-18 10:09:45 +0800 <oldguy_steve> When you hear about some of the things people are being prosecuted and incarcerated for, doesn't it make you sick to see what the Bidens are getting away with?
1317647211602219009 2020-10-18 10:02:30 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Aiming for the leg is dangerous.  If you leave an armed suspect wounded, he becomes much more desperate and dangerous.  Aim for the body mass, or, if you're a confident shot, the head.  They call it lethal force for a reason.  Does anyone disagree?
1317646605361688576 2020-10-18 10:00:06 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @lawyer4laws If you look like her, covering your face as much as possible IS a courtesy.

1317645132062023681 2020-10-18 09:54:14 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Whether they love America or hate America, every country in the world watches us. Some look to us as a shining beacon of hope.  Others would rather see us crawl out from under a pile of radioactive ash.  Either way, when they watch Congress today it's like watching Keystone Cops.
1317643980998205440 2020-10-18 09:49:40 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Marie Antoinette: "Let them eat cake."  Nancy Pelosi: "Let them lose their homes, their jobs, their businesses, and sleep on sidewalks and under bridges.  Unless I get what I want, let them eat $#!T."

This dog couldn't see but he could hear a candy wrapper open from a thousand yards and he could smell bacon cooking as soon as it hit the pan.  I'm sorry for your loss.
1317322632568532996 2020-10-17 12:32:44 +0800 <oldguy_steve> This isn't a battle just to elect a president... it's a battle to save our culture, our constitution, and our way of life.

1317149342663208960 2020-10-17 01:04:09 +0800 <oldguy_steve> OMG!  #Trump2020Landslide is trending.  I wonder why?
1317148196376772609 2020-10-17 00:59:36 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @SenKamalaHarris That dried-up old prune that you're party elected Speaker of the House is the one who's holding up stimulus.

1317096162730467328 2020-10-16 21:32:50 +0800 <oldguy_steve> There are black men doing prison time for only a fraction of the drugs that Hunter Biden did.  Where the hell is the equality and justice reform that Joe keeps flapping his lips about?
1317095821863657473 2020-10-16 21:31:29 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Hunter Biden was his daddy's bag man.  Pure and simple.
1317094786646437888 2020-10-16 21:27:22 +0800 <oldguy_steve> At least this kid is taking an interest in government and doesn't have his eyeballs glued to a monitor while playing Minecraft.  He should be encouraged and applauded.
1317093376722825216 2020-10-16 21:21:46 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @lawyer4laws @tomselliott @JoeBiden Oh, yeah, right... like I'm going to let a Democrat tell me what kind of gun to buy.  It's like consulting an Amish elder when I'm ready for a new car.
1316944700100743168 2020-10-16 11:30:58 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @DukeJackLorinar Okay, Sargent, I'll cease and desist with  #CrookedJoeBiden and not use  #CrookedJoeBiden any more.
1316933803286429697 2020-10-16 10:47:40 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @JoeBiden You're a dick, Joe.  When you tax a landlord who makes $400K+ in combined salary and rental income, don't you think the rent's going up?  When you tax a small business owner additional taxes, don't you think that will result in layoffs or cutbacks in hours and benefits?
1316931855791292419 2020-10-16 10:39:56 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Really?  #CrookedJoeBiden is trending?  I wonder why that is
1316832119956492288 2020-10-16 04:03:37 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Might there be a plan to elect Biden, knowing he was fully aware of his son's criminal activities, then have him impeached after the election so that Heels Up Harris gets a seat in the Oval Office?  https://t.co/RQhGZhOZxn
1316830250693582849 2020-10-16 03:56:11 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Hunter Biden should write a book, "How to get Kicked out of the Navy for Drugs, Knock Up a Stripper, and Become an International Multimillionaire CEO."  Would you read it?  https://t.co/yYrDeN86he

1316436388892508160 2020-10-15 01:51:07 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Hunter Biden introduced his father to a top executive at a Ukrainian energy firm less than a year before Joe pressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor who was investigating the company where his son was on the board.  Is this okay?  https://t.co/Cbh5yADTFx
1316372911662329856 2020-10-14 21:38:53 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Sen.

Is that a stupid, sexist, unwarranted question or what?  https://t.co/7Do7yL6Fi4

1316070811917193217 2020-10-14 01:38:27 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The Democrats are screaming that our President is infecting the masses by holding rallies.  The doctors have said he's not infectious, but they would rather not listen to the science.    They would just LOVE for him not to hold rallies and give Sleepy Joe a chance to catch up.  https://t.co/Z9L653YPrb

1315370686890696704 2020-10-12 03:16:24 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @RepStevenSmith Unbelievable.  They're not even trying to hid the bias any longer.

1315214049940971521 2020-10-11 16:53:59 +0800 <oldguy_steve> California governor Gavin Newsom says you should wear your mask between bites when eating in a restaurant.  That is the stupidest, most absurd thing I've ever heard.  If you have to do that, don't eat out at all.  Have Democrats totally politicized mask wearing?  https://t.co/3hGTB5gyyO

He's exhibiting the same behavior now that bigots in the 1950s and 60s did back then.
1315011445688430593 2020-10-11 03:28:55 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @heather_giron @Roy04297351 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump I don't like the tipping system at all. Owners should pay their employees a fair wage to provide good service.  However, the system is what it is.  If you can't afford to tip, or you just don't want to, then eat at home our at a fast food place.
1314796427688640512 2020-10-10 13:14:30 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Is there anyone out there who's never used the "F" word?
1314753073286316038 2020-10-10 10:22:14 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Beware:  When they have a total majority, the Democrat left will take your rights away and hand them back little by little if you remain in their favor and do what you're told.
1314649393123880960 2020-10-10 03:30:14 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @kpsullivan1202 Looks like somebody's been messing with DNA.
1314598820227903489 2020-10-10 00:09:17 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Oh, and while I'm at it, don't come over here from a war-torn shithole like Somalia, ask us to give you and your family refuge, then tell us what our constitutional rights are.
1314598457038913536 2020-10-10 00:07:50 +0800 <oldguy_steve> No, it's not.  Abstinence is a constitutional right.  Not having unprotected sex is a constitutional right.  Adoption is a reasonable alternative.  Killing an unborn child because they present an inconvenience to you IS NOT YOUR RIGHT.
1314576795199397889 2020-10-09 22:41:46 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @no_silenced Case law is pretty clear that a booby trap designed to do intentional harm is the same as being there and injuring the person yourself.  If they can prove the homeowner rigged the sign, they'll probably be prosecuted.
1314575978706812933 2020-10-09 22:38:31 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I wonder if the American people realize that every day Congress tries to undermine or oust the President is a day that they're not representing you.  You have no stimulus check, no extended unemployment, no business payroll assistance, all of which both sides agree are necessary.
1314573935359356928 2020-10-09 22:30:24 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The fake dossier didn't work. The Mueller investigation didn't work. The attempted coup failed. Impeachment failed.  I know, let's try to change the Constitution so that we can invoke the 25th Amendment.  Pretty sick, yeah?  https://t.co/kWE8V6wd5j
1314272985369341952 2020-10-09 02:34:32 +0800 <oldguy_steve> It's okay to wander around without underwear.  Just don't forget your freakin' mask.
1314197206224650243 2020-10-08 21:33:25 +0800 <oldguy_steve> President Trump told them that they can take their virtual debate and shove it, virtually.  Good.
1314196798542499840 2020-10-08 21:31:48 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @CNN What a shock.
1314196074630848512 2020-10-08 21:28:55 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I watched the entire debate with a barf bag beside my chair.  Every time Kamala broke into that fake little girl grin and scrunchy face, it got a little more full.
1314195140370604032 2020-10-08 21:25:12 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @DailyCaller Flaccid, Nicole?  What, as opposed to erect?
1314194809901387777 2020-10-08 21:23:53 +0800 <oldguy_steve> That's how they did it.  That fly is a miniature drone which carries a small capsule of the COVID-19 virus. You couldn't see the one that landed on President Trump.  https://t.co/8nY7u19p3U
1313950026490552320 2020-10-08 05:11:12 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @CaptainLives When I see a Biden/Harris sign it makes me want to pee.
1313879376820232193 2020-10-08 00:30:28 +0800 <oldguy_steve> CNN has said thereâ€™s a 98% chance Antifa would win a civil war in the US.  CNN has obviously forgotten about the the millions of law-abiding patriots who stock military-grade firearms and ammunition in their homes, in accordance with our 2nd Amendment.
1313864298758770689 2020-10-07 23:30:33 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @WCLJR54 I don't plan on getting THAT close.  ðŸ¤£
1313860699810979840 2020-10-07 23:16:15 +0800 <oldguy_steve> If I had to debate Kamala Harris, I would want not only at least a 12-foot distance and a plexiglass shield but also two giant box fans blowing in her direction.
1313843123924025346 2020-10-07 22:06:25 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I wouldn't line my bird cage with the New York Times.  Birds deserve to crap on something much more dignified and truthful.
1313842092079157249 2020-10-07 22:02:19 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @missyhope1 I run out of breath because I'm old and fat.  No COVID necessary.
1313694930947108864 2020-10-07 12:17:33 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Do you think there was a COVID attack on the White House, which was intended as an assassination attempt?
1313694042278916096 2020-10-07 12:14:01 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Meet Nancy Pelosi's daddy, Thomas D'Alesandro Jr. who, was a U.S. Representative from Maryland's 3rd congressional district (1939â€“47) and subsequently the mayor of Baltimore, Maryland (1947â€“59).  Mafia ties?  You decide.  https://t.co/6iYfTpq3qS
1313691701655920641 2020-10-07 12:04:43 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Trumps sons are campaigning for him.    Biden's sons?  Well, one of them is dead and the other is hiding from the media.
1313689030937116672 2020-10-07 11:54:06 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @JoeBiden I would rather be together with a sewer slug than the likes of you, Joe.
1313687833874329601 2020-10-07 11:49:21 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @DeniseKiesler I always follow back unless there's some compelling reason not to... for example, if their entire profile is in Arabic.
1313558561188802561 2020-10-07 03:15:40 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Think about it, folks, if Democrats hold the majority and the White House, you may not be able to carry a gun but you'll be able to abort an unborn child.
1313557948799438848 2020-10-07 03:13:14 +0800 <oldguy_steve> It's kind of hard to believer that 50 people a day in my follower base are getting suspended - and even at that, not coming back.
1313557808709726208 2020-10-07 03:12:40 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I do know that when someone's account gets suspended, they temporarily unfollow everyone on their follow list.  If you look at this in a 3rd party app like Who-unfollowed-me you will see their follower count reduced to zero.  When they're off suspension, they follow back again.
1313415424151703553 2020-10-06 17:46:53 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Wow!  I keep getting new follower notifications.  Nevertheless my follower count goes steadily down every day.  Why would Twitter care how many followers I have?  I can't believe there are that many people leaving.
1313322828737867776 2020-10-06 11:38:57 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @LymanBay This was the "drive by" he did for supporters yesterday.
1313186169681666048 2020-10-06 02:35:55 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @Duckyv72 @EJuneBayne I almost wish I still lived in your district so that I could vote for you.
1313182959407493121 2020-10-06 02:23:09 +0800 <oldguy_steve> The press was busy this morning condemning the President's drive-by to show appreciation for those who came to the hospital to show their support.  If that had been Biden, they would have run never-ending coverage of how brave and considerate he was to acknowledge their presence.  https://t.co/bDgh7obN5Q
1313114599743397888 2020-10-05 21:51:31 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @KokopelliAZ Yeah, that's what I thought.  The presidency became the trophy and the "journalists" were the hunters.  If you can bring down a president, it's a huge feather in your cap.  Not that a president shouldn't be held accountable, but that's not the same as going looking for dirt.
1312904712702705664 2020-10-05 07:57:30 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @KokopelliAZ You mean when Watergate broke?
1312851184575635456 2020-10-05 04:24:48 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Kayleigh McEnany: The President spent the morning going faster than a speeding bullet, leaping tall buildings in a single bound, all while fighting for truth, justice, and the American way  Reporter:  Yeah, but was he wearing a mask?  https://t.co/RA4KZuur4i
1312849740069957632 2020-10-05 04:19:04 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @TheoFleury14 @rawsubstancepro If Fidel Castro made things so great, why did people risk their lives coming to the United States on anything that would float?
1312848740625993733 2020-10-05 04:15:05 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @kpsullivan1202 Nice, considering that Starbucks corporate image is one of touchy-feely, liberal, rainbow inclusion.
1312848396655325184 2020-10-05 04:13:43 +0800 <oldguy_steve> CNN reporter Chicken Little reports that according to anonymous sources, the sky is falling.  https://t.co/MZtfD2oArA
1312846821434093568 2020-10-05 04:07:28 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @KamalaHarris Willie told us you've already given your all.
1312823829849206784 2020-10-05 02:36:06 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @atensnut Hell, if we give California 55 Electoral votes, we should at least give Australia a couple dozen.
1312823471550861312 2020-10-05 02:34:41 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @missyhope1 She's pretty good with that finger!
1312742199906332672 2020-10-04 21:11:44 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @atensnut Many, many #wetbuzzardfart s
1312548555102412805 2020-10-04 08:22:16 +0800 <oldguy_steve> No, son, your mom and I aren't getting a divorce.  We're just social distancing.  https://t.co/IrmQorkIp8
1312544878908170240 2020-10-04 08:07:39 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Who the hell is this clown?  He should be smart enough to know that the President doesn't appoint his successor.  Oh, Vanity Fair?  The facts don't matter there.
1312543313057071105 2020-10-04 08:01:26 +0800 <oldguy_steve> It's easy to feel this way when you descend from a family that's lived off the back-breaking work of their "subjects" for generations. This kid was born into wealth and has no idea what a real job looks like. He doesn't belong in the US, IMHO, but the Brits won't have him.
1312386868105805824 2020-10-03 21:39:46 +0800 <oldguy_steve> This is my new rescue dog.  I'm naming him Joe Biden.  https://t.co/DUTHqACGGG
1312363164311248896 2020-10-03 20:05:35 +0800 <oldguy_steve> At a time in our history when we could use good, honest, unbiased information we are instead left with babble and banter that doesn't even qualify as entertainment.  When they should be worried about the accuracy of their reporting, our networks worry only about ratings.
1312071325389742082 2020-10-03 00:45:55 +0800 <oldguy_steve>  https://t.co/ASFjssSdId
1312070121062424584 2020-10-03 00:41:08 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Even the thought of Nancy Pelosi in the Oval Office, if it's just for a day, gives me a terrible itching rash.
1312037487011790848 2020-10-02 22:31:28 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @Taylorm6679 I could not agree more.  Putting anything in (or on) your body should also be a personal choice.
1311968377989001216 2020-10-02 17:56:51 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Our President is probably the best protected person in the world and he still contracted COVID.  Nobody is safe.  We need a vaccine NOW!
1311727283242061824 2020-10-02 01:58:49 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @RobsoxV About the same as responding to a woman in public not wearing a hijab.
1311700707414695936 2020-10-02 00:13:13 +0800 <oldguy_steve> 40,000+ airline employees are out of work today because Nancy Pelosi couldn't pull her head out of her ass long enough to get a relief bill passed.
1311700405110202369 2020-10-02 00:12:01 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Want to clean up Medicare?  Make sure Congress has Medicare as their ONLY government-sponsored healthcare instead of what they have now.  See how fast the "donut hole" disappears.
1311698788390641664 2020-10-02 00:05:35 +0800 <oldguy_steve> White privilege?  What about celebrity privilege?
1311511450490290176 2020-10-01 11:41:11 +0800 <oldguy_steve> MCP = Muslim Community Patrol.  Is this what the left means when they say "community policing"?  https://t.co/aUMNBFetCb
1311337736415051777 2020-10-01 00:10:54 +0800 <oldguy_steve> Joe Biden says Antifa is "just an idea".  Really, Joe?  When's the last time you saw an "idea" do this?  https://t.co/lm2EUTl7Ev
1311309509369892864 2020-09-30 22:18:44 +0800 <oldguy_steve> An article about Trump's taxes is a "blockbuster report".  An article about Hunter Biden taking 3.5 million dollars from the wife of the mayor of Moscow is hardly mentioned.
1311154846511161346 2020-09-30 12:04:10 +0800 <oldguy_steve> In 2016, Joe Biden let Hillary Clinton hijack a nomination that was rightfully his.  He doesn't deserve to be President.
1311153071502684160 2020-09-30 11:57:06 +0800 <oldguy_steve> How come I'm always hearing "My son Beau" and never "My son Hunter"?  Huh?  Huh?
1311149493992079360 2020-09-30 11:42:54 +0800 <oldguy_steve> @atensnut Juanita, you must be grading on a curve.  I give him a W.
1311149005112446977 2020-09-30 11:40:57 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I used to watch my kids argue over some insignificant bullshit when they were toddlers.  I learned just about as much as I did from watching tonight's debate.  It was an unmoderated free for all.
1311147008527269888 2020-09-30 11:33:01 +0800 <oldguy_steve> I've never moderated a debate ever... but I could do a much better job of it that Chris Wallace did.  Mike Wallace is spinning like a top in his grave.
