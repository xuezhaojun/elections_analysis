1344056813235425281 2020-12-30 07:04:50 +0800 <dardar1126> @thejordanader I love this...'bots got the moves!

1344035010324664326 2020-12-30 05:38:12 +0800 <dardar1126> @thejordanader Another possibly missed video. Hilary Hahn plays this beautifully.

1344028559841636352 2020-12-30 05:12:34 +0800 <dardar1126> @thejordanader Isn't it great! Such a different perspective-it's intense. Reminds me of the feeling I got when I first saw Riverdance. It was thrilling to see so many talented dancers perfectly in unison;the sound of their steps combined w/that great Irish music brought tears of joy to my eyes.
1344024955575554049 2020-12-30 04:58:14 +0800 <dardar1126> @thejordanader My reaction.
1344024860939399174 2020-12-30 04:57:52 +0800 <dardar1126> @thejordanader I posted this last night. Don't know if you saw it; wanted to make sure you did.

1343980457592049667 2020-12-30 02:01:25 +0800 <dardar1126> @jbf1755 This is a beautiful musical representation of a lark in flight...ascending.
1343978812665700352 2020-12-30 01:54:53 +0800 <dardar1126> @bobbycblanchard Too true. My niece&amp;her husband live in Round Rock. They had 2 dogs(1 died last year),&amp; those dogs took every opportunity to crawl under the back fence &amp; go for a romp around the field &amp; neighborhood. The kids would have to go out to round them up, often w/the help of neighbors.

1343792483684274178 2020-12-29 13:34:29 +0800 <dardar1126> @MaraisThe Bravo to cinematographer Stefano Pancaldi! I love the close camera work on the hands and bows of the musicians. You not only hear the beautiful music, but you SEE it being created in a kind of raw, visceral way. It's quite thrilling!

Besides speaking affectionate terms to the leopard, at one point he asks it for a hug/embrace, and several times he counts to 3 before he dunks them in the water. Sorry, that's all I got.

1342677011207237634 2020-12-26 11:41:59 +0800 <dardar1126> @dodo OK, now I'm crying...AGAIN! I've had so many tears today, some happy like this new meeting, and some devastatingly sad due to the cancer death of a beautiful 9-month old baby girl. An emotional roller-coaster today...well, really for the last 10 months.

Judy, looking lovely, but sad,&amp;Margaret O'Brien w/tears in her eyes. And what also makes me sad is that even though Judy was so beautiful, she never felt she was. She always compared herself to Ava Gardner and Lana Turner.

1341595736962703360 2020-12-23 12:05:23 +0800 <dardar1126> @AngieCoiro Mazel tov! But as I love Star Trek, I cannot see viewing it as a slog. (In all honesty, some of the original series episodes were pretty squirrelly. What with hippies, etc. But there were some classics like The City on the Edge of Forever. Loved Next Generation though.)
1341559553872310275 2020-12-23 09:41:37 +0800 <dardar1126> @TracesofTexas The farmer side of our family would always butcher a hog as a family event. As a townie from big ol' 1960s San Marcos, I wasn't that into it. I do remember a large cast iron pot full of melted lard where they cooked the chitlins.

Was only a few yrs ago that I found out song was abt oral sex! I was so naive growing up that songs about sex or drugs just went right over my head.  https://t.co/EhY8QbUOJn

1340096642230435851 2020-12-19 08:48:31 +0800 <dardar1126> A little disappointing, but, since I like you, I'll cut you some slack. And I'll be magnanimous and give you the translation (because, of course, I chose #1, duh):  Life is like a sewer. You get out of it what you put into it.
1340092867944050694 2020-12-19 08:33:32 +0800 <dardar1126> Another popular piece was her instructions for writing your own Gilbert and Sullivan opera:  https://t.co/lzsqtuE40b 3/3  She also did Mozart and Verdi operas, and many other hilarious pieces.
1340091460520128513 2020-12-19 08:27:56 +0800 <dardar1126> She used her voice and piano to illustrate musical themes, etc. Perhaps her most famous piece was her description of Wagner's "Der Ring des Nibelungen":  https://t.co/ONIyoVv2Rg 2/3
1340090626797395975 2020-12-19 08:24:37 +0800 <dardar1126> @thejordanader After our inaugural special on Tom Lehrer "The Man, the Myth, the Mathematician," we begin our mini-series with Anna Russell. She was a British opera singer and comedian. Her specialty was giving lectures on specific pieces of music or musical styles. 1/3
1340083512137887746 2020-12-19 07:56:21 +0800 <dardar1126> @thejordanader In Tom Lehrer's Copenhagen concert there comes a point where he quotes a Danish proverb in Danish (which is seen in the subtitles-Livet er som en kloak. Man far det ud af det man kommer i det.). It is not translated into English. When that happened what did you do?

1336481768979959810 2020-12-09 09:24:19 +0800 <dardar1126> @JeffreyGuterman My family and I met Slim Pickens once at Alamo Village at Brackettville, Texas in the 60s. I don't remember the exact year, but I was probably in mid to late grade school. He was very tall, and very nice and very friendly. He chatted with us and I got his autograph.

Or coif my hair; if it's clean &amp; brushed then that's a plus. My clothes are clean (usually) with an emphasis on comfort over fashion. And my shoes are flat (like my ass).

1335375263216111624 2020-12-06 08:07:27 +0800 <dardar1126> @GPerfPBS Well, I've now seen the Josh Groban HARMONY special 4 times (plan to see it another 3 times - thanks @austinpbs KLRU!), so right now all of his songs from the special are on random shuffle in my brain. Each morning I awake with a different one playing in my mind. I love it!

1334237689592287240 2020-12-03 04:47:08 +0800 <dardar1126> @Jewyorican In the mid-80s my ex &amp; I lived on Clarke Avenue in Oakwood Heights. I took the ferry to work in the city. The usual-walk to the Staten Island train, train to the ferry, ferry to Manhattan. But we did cross the Verrazano Bridge on the occasional car trip to Brooklyn or Queens.

I still try with my mother, but between her addiction to FAUX Neuz and her progressive deafness (literal), I feel it's a lost cause.

She gets into his apt and replaces his slippers w/smaller size, puts lower watt light bulbs, etc. He freaks out, thinks he's having a stroke or something!
1332146967074443267 2020-11-27 10:19:21 +0800 <dardar1126> @KaylaChowShow 1. I'm stuffed!  2. OK, I'm ready for seconds.  3. That meat is unremarkable.

1332140324899221504 2020-11-27 09:52:58 +0800 <dardar1126> @JesseLaGreca You are often insightful, with just the right amount of righteous indignation...and with a spicy dash of "Are you fucking kidding me?!?" Hope you are well. And I hope your daughter is well. How old is she now? About 6? I've lost track of time.
1332085686569226244 2020-11-27 06:15:51 +0800 <dardar1126> @AuschwitzMuseum I wonder if that's his bar mitzvah photo? :-(

1331400729664360451 2020-11-25 08:54:04 +0800 <dardar1126> @SibsterManatea I do realize it's the only choice for some;I'm not criticizing you,just offering an opinion.I had no insurance or $ for about 15 yrs until I qualified for Medicare. It's just that back injuries can be complex &amp; tricky to diagnose. I hope you have a friend with medical knowledge.
1331398124183691265 2020-11-25 08:43:43 +0800 <dardar1126> @SibsterManatea If you have a heating pad or hot water bottle the heat (but not too hot) could help relax and soothe your back muscles.
1331397729503866880 2020-11-25 08:42:09 +0800 <dardar1126> @SibsterManatea Self or friend diagnosis is problematic. If you have insurance or some money, I'd say you need to get checked out by a medical professional. It could be muscular or skeletal, a combination or something else entirely.
1331373060897841154 2020-11-25 07:04:08 +0800 <dardar1126> @_SJPeace_ @JoeBiden Sheesh, he won't take office for nearly two more months! You might want to wait and see how things go before you start yelling at him. Give the man a chance; there'll be plenty of time for possible criticism later.
1331355165853704193 2020-11-25 05:53:01 +0800 <dardar1126> @LadyWave4 I know what you mean. Sometimes a name will sound familiar, but that's about it. If it's a rap or hip-hop artist, my chances of recognition go down considerably.

1330990629032255489 2020-11-24 05:44:29 +0800 <dardar1126> @acltv @MavericksMusic This show was FUN! I have bad knees, but I was still chair-dancing. But "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain" gave me all the feels. I only wish the show had been twice as long!! It's certainly worth the time to stream it. How many times can YOU watch it in 4 weeks? ;-)
1330986748357341185 2020-11-24 05:29:04 +0800 <dardar1126> @TracesofTexas I loved The Monkees TV show. In the long ago days before VCRs I was always afraid I wouldn't get home from high school band practice in time for the show. I didn't yet drive and depended on my parents for a ride home. And they were often late.

1330653291005562880 2020-11-23 07:24:01 +0800 <dardar1126> @captbics @TracesofTexas I remember that, too. I was almost 12. We'd gone to visit relatives over Thanksgiving, walked in their house to hear that Jack Ruby had just shot Lee Harvey Oswald live on TV! I thought 'what else could possibly happen?'

Briana's take was more that her edginess was a cover for insecurity, hurt and confusion. A much softer and more sympathetic characterization.

Don't know a lot...he was in a popular boy band, went solo-okay, that's about it.

1328850524930707465 2020-11-18 08:00:28 +0800 <dardar1126> @thejordanader Though I once briefly dated a guy in Salt Lake City who subsequently moved to Seattle&amp;embezzled a lot of $ from an arts org(ballet company, I think).He went on the lam to Israel,was eventually tracked down&amp;arrested! I only found out by seeing an article in the SLC newspaper! 2/2
1328848824480239617 2020-11-18 07:53:43 +0800 <dardar1126> @thejordanader Did you play with the orchestra? Or have some other position?

1328791784886038529 2020-11-18 04:07:03 +0800 <dardar1126> @thejordanader My flute(which is in a storage box somewhere)needs new pads.Funny story:When I lived in Boston we used to get value-pac coupons including ones for a free lotto scratch ticket. Got one &amp; won $500;used it to buy a used Gemeinhardt flute.Had bills to pay,but bought a flute!

But it bothers me almost as much as when I see a typo/error in one of my old tweets...ARGH! (Note: Deleted &amp; reposted this after I saw a typo!)
1328778456948240384 2020-11-18 03:14:06 +0800 <dardar1126> @thejordanader Which makes me think of that great scene in Woody Allen's Take the Money and Run:  https://t.co/DbiRfmc9ZC
1328778209387810818 2020-11-18 03:13:07 +0800 <dardar1126> @thejordanader I understand. I played flute all through high school, then just kind of let it go. I tried to pick it up again after about 20 yrs, but had forgotten a lot. I was every only a slightly above-average player, but it was fun in high school marching band.
1328773511486320643 2020-11-18 02:54:27 +0800 <dardar1126> @thejordanader I've been meaning to ask: Do you play in an orchestra, ensemble, string quartet, do solo work?

1328573594708930567 2020-11-17 13:40:03 +0800 <dardar1126> @TracesofTexas I recently saw a show about this on KLRU. A heartbreaking and infuriating piece of Texas history.
1328566438139990016 2020-11-17 13:11:37 +0800 <dardar1126> @TracesofTexas Definitely. But she's demure, so I see it more as Audrey in Sabrina.

You brought a warmth and vulnerability to the character that made me feel sorry for her (rather than find her endlessly annoying). And your chemistry w/Valentin @japastu is great!
1328493002986315777 2020-11-17 08:19:48 +0800 <dardar1126> @TracesofTexas That's a LOT of dead animals.

1328488684996489222 2020-11-17 08:02:39 +0800 <dardar1126> And since you like the viola de gamba, check out the soundtrack for Tous les matins du monde. Glorious period music played on authentic instruments - heaven!
1328488009138921474 2020-11-17 07:59:58 +0800 <dardar1126> @thejordanader You're welcome.I love Yo-Yo Ma.I saw him in a matinee recital @ the New England Conservatory (Boston) in '92.I had a great seat (even though I bought the ticket at the last minute), &amp; it was amazing! If you want to go old-school, check out Pablo Casals and Mstislav Rostropovich.

1328045674013880320 2020-11-16 02:42:17 +0800 <dardar1126> @waltshaub @GSAEmily But he does concede that he has not a brain in his head, a heart in his chest or a patriotic bone in his body! What a disgrace to everything this country is supposed to stand for.
1327835423511638019 2020-11-15 12:46:49 +0800 <dardar1126> @maddow It's all that economic anxiety. It makes them cranky. We liberals just have to bend over backwards to try to understand them. Right? Isn't that always the media message? What about them leaving the cult and, you know, embracing reality!
1327834438210883585 2020-11-15 12:42:54 +0800 <dardar1126> @donwinslow @Yahoo That's good, I guess. But it's not about what anybody BELIEVES. It's facts, good old math.
1327832836938887168 2020-11-15 12:36:32 +0800 <dardar1126> @donwinslow Dan Patrick=total tool! If you think he's a piece of work check out AG Ken Paxton.He's under indictment for felony securities fraud,has yet to go to court(it's only been 5 YRS).Recently had whistleblowers speak against him.Wish Molly Ivins was still alive to roast these turkeys.
1327826336799477760 2020-11-15 12:10:43 +0800 <dardar1126> @AngieCoiro @cherylhe I agree, Angie. Most of these cultists are so deep into the mindset that they are unreachable. They only listen to each other and the cult pipeline of misinformation and disinformation.  End gerrymandering, voter suppression tactics and the electoral college.
1327824716963459072 2020-11-15 12:04:16 +0800 <dardar1126> @AngieCoiro Nope, her math professor was Sean Spice-Islander. And her tutor was Sarah Huckaloogie. Sad.   #WayLessThanAMillionMAGAMarch

1327789741308260352 2020-11-15 09:45:18 +0800 <dardar1126> @Eva_eva_P Well, they're all known liars. They are craven, and will do or say anything for power (or to be near power). And, of course, they are all Republicans.
1327788968834949125 2020-11-15 09:42:13 +0800 <dardar1126> @TracesofTexas I love how most of the ladies are wearing hats.  https://t.co/ibvDC8lltp
1327779916272832517 2020-11-15 09:06:15 +0800 <dardar1126> @GPerfPBS I loved this special! It made me laugh, and it definitely made me cry. I loved the explanation of how the show fit into and was, in some ways, shaped by the times in which it was created. I watched my Fiddler DVD today, and fell in love all over again.

1327467169060429825 2020-11-14 12:23:30 +0800 <dardar1126> @JeffreyGuterman So poignant to think that in a little over a week JFK would be dead, and their little family shattered.

1327458175533113346 2020-11-14 11:47:46 +0800 <dardar1126> @GPerfPBS Hard question! Like which is your favorite child.   1. Sabbath Prayer 2. Chavaleh 3. Sunrise, Sunset 4. Every other song in the show!
1327428935337062400 2020-11-14 09:51:35 +0800 <dardar1126> @TracesofTexas Too cool! I'm sure it was his pride and joy.

1327359830177304583 2020-11-14 05:16:59 +0800 <dardar1126> @AmandaLandy If they are dismissive of you for being middle-aged, then I (probably 20+ yrs older) must seem like the Crypt Keeper! Those young ladies should respect the knowledge and experience that comes with age.
1327356003923406850 2020-11-14 05:01:47 +0800 <dardar1126> @KenMarino I only keep it to see pictures and news of my family members. I do nothing else on/with Facebook.
1327354838263468032 2020-11-14 04:57:09 +0800 <dardar1126> @AdamParkhomenko Mama made me cry, too! I know how she feels about Social Security and Medicare because it impacts me. Now we really need to protect it by winning both Senate races in Georgia, thus taking the power from #MoscowMitch to try to block all Biden's plans.
1327350377986011137 2020-11-14 04:39:25 +0800 <dardar1126> @itsJeffTiedrich @JoyceWhiteVance I was gonna go with Moe, Larry &amp; Curly, but close enough.

1327089587466985473 2020-11-13 11:23:08 +0800 <dardar1126> It is heartbreaking but suicide figures are up. Could 2 followers please copy and re-post this tweet? I want people to know that someone is always listening. And that you are important. (via @secupp )   Call 1-800-273-8255 (USA hotline)

1327011812970287104 2020-11-13 06:14:05 +0800 <dardar1126> @MaxwellDumb I confess I'm not that familiar with his solo work. But I will definitely check YouTube, etc., and his website to learn more.

1327005639617503232 2020-11-13 05:49:33 +0800 <dardar1126> @buitengebieden_ Love the look, but, DAMN, the patience to lay out 27K coins!
1327000675092488192 2020-11-13 05:29:50 +0800 <dardar1126> @MaxwellDumb I'll definitely have to look for that film. Have you seen The Last Waltz, the documentary of The Band's last concert, by Martin Scorcese? I've seen it so many times; it's excellent.
1326991740595806210 2020-11-13 04:54:19 +0800 <dardar1126> @RF_P0TUS Gotta love when the convicted felons weigh in on whether something was done legally and aboveboard.

1326744021826478080 2020-11-12 12:29:59 +0800 <dardar1126> @DanRather So, that makes Biden the Harlem Globetrotters - works for me! And do I hear the band playing "Sweet Georgia (waiting for a recount) Brown?"

1326731489866887168 2020-11-12 11:40:11 +0800 <dardar1126> @oldhollywood21 @silvermurph One of my all-time favorite movies! When she's sleeping and he says goodbye to her, telling her it's all been a dream...that scene makes me cry every time.  And I loved her in Laura - another fave of mine.

I saw it as a kid and it made such an impression on me. He's survived being hen-pecked by his wife, bullied by his boss. He survives, sorts his food, his books and then breaks his damned glasses!

It's a thoroughly delightful, entertaining and nostalgic retrospective on this great Texas swing band! Plus there are guests like Willie Nelson, Lyle Lovett, Vince Gill and many members of the original Texas Playboys.

1324840478660005889 2020-11-07 06:25:59 +0800 <dardar1126> @kenklippenstein @chrislhayes We would have no need for "red" or "blue" state distinctions. One person, one vote, the candidate with the most votes wins. 2/2
1324839971795161088 2020-11-07 06:23:58 +0800 <dardar1126> @kenklippenstein @chrislhayes Absolutely,abolish the electoral college. It's an absurd&amp;antiquated system.Biden is leading by &gt;4M votes,&amp;the fact that we are sitting here waiting to see if he "wins" the presidency is truly ludicrous!Hillary beat trump by over 3M votes,but no Pres Hillary. 1/2

1323796233211777024 2020-11-04 09:16:31 +0800 <dardar1126> Glad you found it! Since it was done as a mini-series it covers more of the book than the standard 90-120 minute versions. There's also one w/Orson Wells &amp; Joan Fontaine ('43) &amp; one w/Timothy Dalton &amp; Zelah Clarke ('83-not a great version IMHO).

It's a little sexier than most productions.Toby is a bit too handsome to play Rochester,but he's wonderful.His mum is Maggie Smith aka the Dowager Countess of Grantham!

1322716484381134856 2020-11-01 09:45:59 +0800 <dardar1126> @tcm I just watched my DVD of The Haunting this afternoon! I first saw it at age 11 w/my Aunt Helen. I remember during one scene she squeezed my knee so hard I could barely stand it! Still one of the scariest movies I've ever seen.
1322714090565963777 2020-11-01 09:36:28 +0800 <dardar1126> So adorable!

1320090404243603456 2020-10-25 03:50:53 +0800 <dardar1126> Too true! I've long thought that, at this stage, so-called "undecided" voters are either lying because they like all the attention they get...or they're dumb as bricks! The choice couldn't be more stark.

1319701363551571970 2020-10-24 02:04:58 +0800 <dardar1126> @kazweida Exactly. She's just groveling and prostituting herself to try to get another gig with FOX.
1319692653748015104 2020-10-24 01:30:22 +0800 <dardar1126> @wendydavis The original ballots are in a lock box, and she said they could be "reconstructed" and counted if a replacement ballot is not received. So, it sounds like a clerical error vs. voter suppression. 2/2
1319692495199084544 2020-10-24 01:29:44 +0800 <dardar1126> @wendydavis UPDATE: Today I talked to the Caldwell County Elections Administrator Pamela Ohlendorf. She said due to new subdistricts in the county, this led to coding errors being made on about 600 ballots (both DEM &amp; REP). They recommend voters submit a replacement ballot. 1/2

1319423688203173888 2020-10-23 07:41:35 +0800 <dardar1126> @wendydavis Will call Caldwell County election ofc tomorrow. But this is awfully suspicious, if you ask me! 2/2
1319423245783883776 2020-10-23 07:39:50 +0800 <dardar1126> @wendydavis I new wrinkle has occurred. As I posted previously, I verified that my ballot (&amp; my mom's) had been rec'd. But today we both received duplicate General Election ballots in the mail?!? Reported it to TX Dems, they've heard of others w/this issue. 1/2
1319133609228455937 2020-10-22 12:28:55 +0800 <dardar1126> @jaketapper And these a**holes wonder why they are losing the women's vote?!? It's this toxic, pseudo-macho BS that is a BIG TURNOFF for most women. They wouldn't recognize love, kindness and compassion if it bit them on the a**!

1316943417117638656 2020-10-16 11:25:52 +0800 <dardar1126> @AngieCoiro I already voted for #JoeBidenKamalaHarris2020 , so I watched The Frisco Kid.

1315790255556042754 2020-10-13 07:03:37 +0800 <dardar1126> @davidbadash @RobertMaguire_ True. It's only a holiday for those in government (Post Ofc closed, etc.). And I'm not even sure my brother (a civilian employee w/gov't) took the day off. Since he works from home for now, he pretty much creates his schedule (to a point).
1315788742968385536 2020-10-13 06:57:37 +0800 <dardar1126> @RobertMaguire_ @davidbadash Doesn't matter that this is technically a holiday. He does this every day...unless he's wasting his entire day playing golf.

1313930475308711941 2020-10-08 03:53:31 +0800 <dardar1126> @AngieCoiro So true. I (unfortunately) know he's some goofy looking guy who wore a red sweater and asked a question at some candidate's town hall (McCain?). I refuse to look up how much of that I got correct.

1309263894960111616 2020-09-25 06:50:12 +0800 <dardar1126> @TitusNation Unacceptable, but all too believable (unfortunately).

1308548199741882368 2020-09-23 07:26:17 +0800 <dardar1126> @DemWrite @ReallyAmerican1 Exactly right. They knew neither Collins nor Murkowski opposing a SCOTUS vote would make a damn bit of difference.
1308178581294592000 2020-09-22 06:57:33 +0800 <dardar1126> @Jewyorican Looks really cute and fresh.

1307147340004945920 2020-09-19 10:39:46 +0800 <dardar1126> @schuylerannemac I cried off and on for an hour. I've found some solace in PBS - a special about the composer Joseph Haydn and now an art special about contemporary London artists. Something totally separate emotionally.

1307110537763991558 2020-09-19 08:13:31 +0800 <dardar1126> @shannonrwatts I'm in tears.She was so fierce,so mighty,such a role model.Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a small person,but a GIANT intellectually&amp;professionally.She fought so hard for all of us;fought so hard to out live the evil monster in the White House.I'll miss her; I truly fear for our country.
1306410773045030913 2020-09-17 09:52:54 +0800 <dardar1126> I signed Jon Stewart's petition to help veterans suffering from exposure to burn pit toxins. Please sign it, too.  https://t.co/UwCB6jqjUB

1304898651337232388 2020-09-13 05:44:16 +0800 <dardar1126> @KFILE I'm so very sorry. I wish your family the best of luck in finding a successful treatment to heal your baby.
1304557975789543424 2020-09-12 07:10:33 +0800 <dardar1126> @schuylerannemac Me, too. I've been spending more time in bed. Your fur baby Luna must bring a lot of joy. Our fur baby BooBoo is a smaller version of your cat (same coloring), except BooBoo has dark eyes. She is a riot in the mornings when she runs around like a banshee.

We had a potentially great couple with Neal and Alexis, but now he's dead, she's distraught, and, like cockroaches, Sam and  Jason still survive. I hoped he'd die in that cycle wreck.

Howie pisses me off,so I mute him. And to make it simpler,I just mute all the judges now. I like many of the acts,but don't feel any real enthusiasm.
