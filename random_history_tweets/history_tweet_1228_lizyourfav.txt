1302678755010318346 2020-09-07 02:43:12 +0800 <lizyourfav> I definitely 10/10 recommend Franklin Drive Thru Safari in Franklin, TX. Definitely cheaper than the one in SA with more interactive animals, a baby room with lemurs and an anteater and you get to feed the giraffes on your own!  https://t.co/NcscHf7cqu
