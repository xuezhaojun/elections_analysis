1339134291528347648 2020-12-16 17:04:29 +0800 <MarkKelson> @FerranteLavinia Ha! "Mark here. Electronically mailing you from my computer. Best. Mark"
1339128768623939584 2020-12-16 16:42:32 +0800 <MarkKelson> Notable use of "e-mail" there. Google trends only goes back to 2004 but I was in a minority even then.  https://t.co/gDds3NaVKT
1338952014445879298 2020-12-16 05:00:11 +0800 <MarkKelson> @drnorzihachehim Hi Norziha. It is (virtually) in Glasgow, but i will see if they will post the link more widely!
1338949604486881284 2020-12-16 04:50:36 +0800 <MarkKelson> @iainbrennan Ha! Just searched for "thanks a million" in my sent folder. Ten hits from 2003 (my last year in UCC) and then only four over the next 16 years. Your theory is supported!
1338945760692461571 2020-12-16 04:35:20 +0800 <MarkKelson> A fun game.   1. Go to the sent folder of your oldest email 2. Order by oldest date 3. Post a screenshot of the oldest email you've sent   Here's mine. 17 years ago. I have only the vaguest recollection of who Jian/Lisa were &amp; no idea what this was about. He never got back to me!  https://t.co/RAHn2hOPts

1338433551344300035 2020-12-14 18:40:00 +0800 <MarkKelson> @tmorris_mrc I love. Yes, this kind of thing is definitely part of it and I have some examples like that myself. Thanks, this is great!
1338405685541924865 2020-12-14 16:49:16 +0800 <MarkKelson> For the morning crowd: I have a talk soon. The message is that we all know statistical theory is important &amp; useful but *applying* statistics is too. If you have stories exemplifying this idea &amp; why (e.g. insights you've gained, you'd otherwise have missed) I‚Äôd love to hear them.  https://t.co/coMxdrbZlD
1338207353070628864 2020-12-14 03:41:10 +0800 <MarkKelson> I‚Äôm giving a talk soon. The basic message is that we all know statistical theory is important &amp; useful but *applying* statistics is too. If you have any stories that exemplify the idea that statistical application is important I‚Äôd love to hear them.

1334519053415755779 2020-12-03 23:25:11 +0800 <MarkKelson> üé∂ So this is Christmas And what have you done Another year over And a new one just begun üé∂  Far be it from me to criticise, but are we 100% certain he wasn't thinking of New Year's?

1332333933585952769 2020-11-27 22:42:17 +0800 <MarkKelson> @IainALang Thanks will check out!
1332326740438507520 2020-11-27 22:13:43 +0800 <MarkKelson> @IainALang What about you? Any recommendations?
1332326671156998145 2020-11-27 22:13:26 +0800 <MarkKelson> @IainALang Yes, I do. I loved Neuromancer ( not new but I'd never read it), Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, Children of Time, I am Legend, Gun, with occasional music and read Cat's Cradle almost all the way through before realising I'd read it before ! All great.
1332324207661871106 2020-11-27 22:03:39 +0800 <MarkKelson> Delighted to take part in the inaugural TSC meeting for the CHoosing Active Role Models to INspire Girls (CHARMING) study aimed at increasing physical activity in girls (9-11). Great to see lots of familiar faces! @_KellyMorgan_ , Janis Baird, @FosteratBristol , @DrJemmaHawkins
1332267289656270848 2020-11-27 18:17:28 +0800 <MarkKelson> @IainALang Ha! Yes, I am! Something about the first lockdown got me back into sci-fi after not reading any for about twenty years! Really enjoying it!
1331681470709190656 2020-11-26 03:29:38 +0800 <MarkKelson> @IainALang ... football, &amp; therefore felt ambivalent about the two together, then the response is just the sum. Nothing ‚Äúunexpected‚Äù happens. However, if we hate crowds, love football, but *really* love (or hate) a football crowd, then that would be an interaction in the statistical sense.
1331681345647628288 2020-11-26 03:29:08 +0800 <MarkKelson> @IainALang Hi Iain. As you may have gathered i am talking about statistical interactions here (albeit using examples similar to yours to get the intuition). So, the key is that the experience of the two together should be different to the sum of the parts. So, if we hate crowds, but love...
1331646192288227330 2020-11-26 01:09:27 +0800 <MarkKelson> @statsmethods @PWGTennant I'm quite content to have haggled you down from "meaningless" to "meaning in some instances"! :-) I should have said this is in the context of undergraduate stats, not med stats so deterministic mechanisms are not completely unrealistic!
1331637774072631296 2020-11-26 00:36:00 +0800 <MarkKelson> @statsmethods @PWGTennant ...kilometres is unfortunate but I would be uncomfortable saying the interaction is meaningless therefore?
1331637425895038977 2020-11-26 00:34:37 +0800 <MarkKelson> @statsmethods @PWGTennant To maybe put it another way. Bread baked with yeast alone won't rise (I think, just go with me here). Bread baked with sugar, ditto. Bread baked with both does because of the interaction. Despite the fact that I could disappear the interaction if I measured bread height in ....
1331635390269190145 2020-11-26 00:26:32 +0800 <MarkKelson> @statsmethods @PWGTennant I see. This is now getting into hypothesis testing criticism though right? Is any of this specific to interactions or is it all about testing?
1331632032955445248 2020-11-26 00:13:11 +0800 <MarkKelson> @statsmethods @PWGTennant ...But I'm struggling to see why the fact that other scalings could yield different results is an indictment of interactions per se. The same could be said of almost any statistical method. Change the input, you might get a different output.
1331631810992893954 2020-11-26 00:12:18 +0800 <MarkKelson> @statsmethods @PWGTennant I think i am using scale &amp; measure &amp; variable interchangeably here which doesn't help! What I mean is given a variable &amp; a way of scaling it you can decide whether there is an interaction. The meaning derivable from it relates to whether you agree with the variable &amp; scaling...
1331627775934017538 2020-11-25 23:56:16 +0800 <MarkKelson> @statsmethods @PWGTennant ...But that given a scale and an approach it is possible to meaningfully say that there is a statistical interaction between two treatment factors. This is different to saying that we have found out some kind of truth, but then no single study can demonstrate that, in any case.
1331627609730510855 2020-11-25 23:55:37 +0800 <MarkKelson> @statsmethods @PWGTennant I'm beginning to see the point. I suppose my counter-argument would be that lots (all) of analyses can look different if you look at them in different ways (including by changing and transforming the variables used). And you might therefore conclude different things from them...
1331622429001707520 2020-11-25 23:35:02 +0800 <MarkKelson> @statsmethods @PWGTennant I see. And so when you say that you wouldn't view the initial examples as interactions in any sense, are you saying there is no "delicious and refreshing" scale you can conceive of that would allow you to conclude that there was an interaction?
1331620868380831747 2020-11-25 23:28:49 +0800 <MarkKelson> @statsmethods @PWGTennant Yes, say it is something like that. When you say "it depends on the scale" what is the "it"?
1331619251451551744 2020-11-25 23:22:24 +0800 <MarkKelson> @statsmethods @PWGTennant Interesting, if a little cryptic. What depends on the scale on which you measure the effect?
1331610209383493633 2020-11-25 22:46:28 +0800 <MarkKelson> @statsmethods @PWGTennant Ha! Is nothing ever simple? The defn i'm using is "a situation  where the presence or absence of multiple treatment factors simultaneously affects the response in a way that is greater or less than the sum of the individual treatment factor effects".
1331587302582312964 2020-11-25 21:15:27 +0800 <MarkKelson> @MarcusMunafo @DrGBuckingham Ha! Certainly! The patent office haven't got back to me yet, so fill your boots until they do!
1331583764514938881 2020-11-25 21:01:23 +0800 <MarkKelson> @DrGBuckingham Ha! More food. I like it, but is it obviously an interaction? I mean, avo &amp; bacon are both delicious. Avo + bacon is certainly more delicious than either on it's own, but is it obviously greater than the sum of the components? I think this requires practical exploratory analysis!
1331581485409853442 2020-11-25 20:52:20 +0800 <MarkKelson> Thinking about intuitive examples of interactions. Keep coming up with food related ones.  Nuts = delicious Chewing gum = refreshing Nuts + gum ‚â† delicious &amp; refreshing  Gin = a bit rough Tonic = a bit bitter Gin + Tonic = delicious &amp; refreshing   Any better examples?
1330975371014049793 2020-11-24 04:43:51 +0800 <MarkKelson> Goodness. This is worth 6 minutes of your time. Beautiful.
