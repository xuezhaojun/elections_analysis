There is no way it turned blue prior to the last decade.  Now that the population has been subsumed by illegal immigrants it may be true. But prior to that the entire state outside of the dense Urban decay zones were always a deep, deep red.

I‚Äôve always heard that ‚Äúvoters‚Äù are taught to just vote straight line Dem ticket, as it‚Äôs simple to instruct.   That it‚Äôs just a single top line vote is odd.  Strait ticket is the first option your given (in Alabama anyway) prior to being able to vote race by race.

Thus starving the Whites of their earned resources they feel they need to raise their own children in this world.  I agree, we need to make babies regardless if we can afford.
