1344059532620804096 2020-12-30 07:15:38 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Another layer of how pathetic our broken government is how it was to just throw us a random amount $600 or $2000. So not only are we not getting it, but our government has no interest in really delving into the details of what is needed to be done to get us out of this crisis.
1344056070520639489 2020-12-30 07:01:53 +0800 <YourComicMuse> How about just enjoying the weather, scenery, friends and dog without guns or killing innocent animals for no reason? Do you really think heaven has shotguns?

1343641153191739393 2020-12-29 03:33:09 +0800 <YourComicMuse> This is a loaded question. I grew up in Memphis TN. When chain restaurants like Bennigan's started in the 80s, things like warm honey mustard dressing were the height of sophistication. We'd never seen anything like it. You have to account for time period and region.
1343638390806339588 2020-12-29 03:22:10 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @mattknudsen Get Matt Knudsen to stop calling me buddy, as I am a girl. So to get Matt Knudsen to stop being one of those happily married guys who feels scared to even talk to women, because they might think it's flirting. Didn't want to say it, but it's a slippery slope to being Mike Pence.

1343315373991424000 2020-12-28 05:58:37 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Another cherry on the huge Hilaria Baldwin sundae is how Alec Baldwin spoke in every interview, publication and to anyone he could, about how delighted he was to find Hilaria - a sane, yoga teaching, young wife after enduring Kim Basinger who he openly called batshit crazy.

1342142711655063552 2020-12-25 00:18:52 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I'm on a layover. Just got my one granola bar and one orange Christmas breakfast from the hotel to eat alone in my room. I know the staff here, and like flight crews, they're terrified but glad to have not been furloughed yet, and hope to get vaccinated before covid gets them.

1341482454331383808 2020-12-23 04:35:15 +0800 <YourComicMuse> In 1999 I think my rent for my first studio apartment, about 300 sq. ft., was around $650 plus utilities.
1341471422170890241 2020-12-23 03:51:25 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Done it.
1341467572068225024 2020-12-23 03:36:07 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Just chatted with a contractor friend who's had to turn down multiple home building jobs because of the ban on allowing skilled laborers in under Trump. So if you're wondering why rent &amp; home prices stay obscenely high in all this, one reason is lack of growth and inventory.
1341418367194865665 2020-12-23 00:20:35 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Social media has changed so much. During the anthrax scare after 9/11 all the celebs openly bragged about getting their impossible to obtain Cipro. Now, you know they're getting vaccinated before us, but now they know to hide it.
1341377767301111808 2020-12-22 21:39:15 +0800 <YourComicMuse> This doesn't just apply to immigrants. Every working person I know feels this way too:)

I've drank very little water and a lot of comfort drinks like soda and juice. If I was still eating healthy and drinking mainly water like before covid I'd blow away.
1341184056860442625 2020-12-22 08:49:31 +0800 <YourComicMuse> The Baby Boomers expect us to let them still rule the world when they peaked in success during a decade that Mare Winningham was given a run of major movie stardom.
1341152043134668800 2020-12-22 06:42:19 +0800 <YourComicMuse> There are certain tortures I would rather endure than let someone do a hard pull of my credit score. I'm a single woman with an 814. That adds about $350,000 in value to me as a human being in this shitty, completely nonsensical, capitalist country.
1341059775618899968 2020-12-22 00:35:40 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I know these kind of rich celebrities are trying to be supportive of us, it just doesn't make me feel good things though. It makes me feel very, very, very, very bad things.
1340325019969208325 2020-12-19 23:56:01 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Can we get both the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccine?  https://t.co/F89aiZ0vHo
1340163585293488128 2020-12-19 13:14:32 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Lmao. Wow, I wonder how they EVER got this scoop?! Did it accidentally leak out like his on set Jerry Maguire/A Few Good Men/Every character he's ever played style rant??
1340158567291125761 2020-12-19 12:54:36 +0800 <YourComicMuse> You can really feel how much the pandemic has changed you if you try to watch Love Actually this year. Holy Shit. It seems like some absurdist representation of humans made by aliens. Doesn't even seem like the characters are in our species.
1340151834518810624 2020-12-19 12:27:50 +0800 <YourComicMuse> At this point in the pandemic you can really feel the celebrities, especially the actors, seething about not getting 1/1000th of the attention they usually get. I think we should make that permanent.  Especially don't bring back their awards shows.
1340136181523128325 2020-12-19 11:25:38 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Don't mean to sound like a diva, but I really miss air. Breathing in and out. I've just gotten word at my airline we are going to be wearing masks at least another year regardless of how the vaccination goes. And masks could become permanently mandatory.
1340135499567038464 2020-12-19 11:22:56 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Please just never forget when the shit really came down, and we were dying and losing everything in a pandemic our government in unprecedented global terms to other countries said a resounding FUCK YOU. Trump and the GOP of course, but the establishment Dems too.
1340055457642258440 2020-12-19 06:04:52 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Pence should have been the next to the very last person to be vaccinated.
1340037787404406784 2020-12-19 04:54:39 +0800 <YourComicMuse> On a DC layover. This is the view from my hotel. If you zoom you see I can see (much closer than they look in this pic) the Washington Monument, Pentagon and Capitol. I think at some point we have to be honest that in world comparison, our monuments are ugly, sad and crude.  https://t.co/Ic9IVUoWlC
1339771271534571521 2020-12-18 11:15:37 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I remember these fights back in 2012 and 2013. We all laughed at what a hapless dickhead Trump was. Oh how we laughed:(
1339440808970227713 2020-12-17 13:22:29 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Or I'm not a scientologist, so I don't know.
1339439704668860417 2020-12-17 13:18:05 +0800 <YourComicMuse> So without any real covid relief and moratoriums on eviction ending, be prepared for the fun of Republicans blaming Biden when the housing market collapses the first 6 months he's in office.
1339436933135548416 2020-12-17 13:07:05 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Now do people made homeless by the pandemic or imprisoned for non violent crimes for cash bail.

Please let him bring proud boys and his other terrorist supporters in to protect him and have a stand off. He's that dumb. Please let us watch them all be mowed down or arrested.
1339380941425238016 2020-12-17 09:24:35 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Tom Cruise is a lifer scientologist. Tom Cruise once told paparazzi to "happen upon" him riding a motorcycle with Katie Holmes. When they got there he is taped saying "How did you guys find us!?" A sassy pap said "You told us to be here." That recording wasn't an accident.
1339371673414479874 2020-12-17 08:47:45 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Tom Cruise implies the existence of a Tom Accelerate.

1337258472459603968 2020-12-11 12:50:39 +0800 <YourComicMuse> When I renew one of my federal badges every year that allows me to be a mere flight attendant, I have to attest under risk of perjury and jail time that I have committed no acts of sedition. Just to be a flight attendant.
1337254652732198914 2020-12-11 12:35:28 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @EricStangel He famously already did it, hung it in his home in Trump Tower, got called out for it, and still refused to admit it was fake years ago. For real, you can Google it. He did the same thing with a fake Renoir he had while the original hung in the Chicago art museum.

1337249093828087808 2020-12-11 12:13:23 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I like you Seth Rogen, but it's just weird to have a grown movie star who is also the sophomore year stoner roommate of every guy me or my friends dated at The University of Colorado, Boulder.

But please emphasize that the people in need ARE THE TAXPAYERS IN THIS COUNTRY. They aren't people who are beggars who don't care for themselves, they paid for relief IN TAXES.

1336733489048248322 2020-12-10 02:04:33 +0800 <YourComicMuse> So I guess the vaccine can't cure the media using the word "efficacy" ad nauseum huh?
1336480520067280898 2020-12-09 09:19:21 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Watched 5 minutes of The Bachelorette for the first time in my life, and I can definitely say America deserves everything that has happened to it in the last 4 years.
1336419570194780161 2020-12-09 05:17:09 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Been so busy lately I'm actually relieved to have to lay in bed with the lady cramps.

1335394183411085312 2020-12-06 09:22:38 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Forget the terms boomer, gen x, millennial, etc. Generational divides are really more frequent and technology based. For instance a laptop to me will always be the miraculous first computer that wasn't a desktop, not just another option in an array of portable devices.

1334331626009088000 2020-12-03 11:00:24 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Watching the Rockefeller Christmas tree special, and I won't ever forgive millennials for making these pathetic, Kelly Clarkson reality show motherfuckers into actual stars. In a lot of ways, it is how we ended up with Trump.

1334185986344017920 2020-12-03 01:21:41 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @heykarlin It's very hard to think illicit thoughts about you when you're always talking about your wife.

1334184122701508614 2020-12-03 01:14:17 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Looking at real estate through a realtor is like having a full time unpaid internship with a flaky celebrity. And your pay off for all your time and effort is you lose your life savings and the realtor gets 6 percent of it.

1333830391610945538 2020-12-02 01:48:41 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Not only is being New York centric  ignorant and provincial it is SO outdated. It's like saying the best place to honeymoon is Niagara Falls.
1333826646017773570 2020-12-02 01:33:48 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Imagine going to an orgy and this guy is there. And he doesn't just want to masturbate while he watches you, but do you himself.
1333825172017729538 2020-12-02 01:27:56 +0800 <YourComicMuse> We should make everyone calling all of us mean as they passionately defend the New York bodega tweeter watch 1970s and 80s Woody Allen movies on a loop for a month.
1333822894628016132 2020-12-02 01:18:53 +0800 <YourComicMuse> If you Twitter people had any idea how many working class people making your food, stocking your food, driving you around and waiting on you know they have been exposed to covid but are not quarantining to keep food on their table you would flip the fuck out.

1333499213246844928 2020-12-01 03:52:42 +0800 <YourComicMuse> How did I not know there was a mysterious monolith in real life? I guess it's good I didn't, because honestly I would have gone out there to see it probably on most of my days off. I have feelings about 2001: A Space Odyssey that border on the religious.

But I'm in Miami and am eating almost solely at Cuban places and they're similar and awesome. Something about the oil they cook them, also the perfect size and shape. I don't know.
1333464562541203458 2020-12-01 01:35:00 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @thatbilloakley Really? Have you ever been to a Cuban owned restaurant, or Costa Rica, or anywhere in South America and eaten french fries?

1333455674433564673 2020-12-01 00:59:41 +0800 <YourComicMuse> One of the biggest little differences: How people who call them papa fritas make them vs. how people who call them chips, french fries or frites make them.  Papa fritas are light years tastier.
1333454652055154695 2020-12-01 00:55:38 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Grand Illusion definitely should have beat Gone With The Wind for best picture.

All he talked about was travel, food, good drinks, music. Very witty. He told great stories and was very entertaining and attentive and generous to everyone around him when we met.
1333445139629543424 2020-12-01 00:17:50 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Met a guy so funny, charming and smart I mistakenly thought he was gay. He asked me over for an outdoor, distanced grilled steak dinner. Great taste in wine. Great cook. Then he said "These liberals don't know..." and on and on. Total Republican. Never would've seen it coming:(

He said Trump is the first thing that's reminded him of Castro.

1332470129192558601 2020-11-28 07:43:29 +0800 <YourComicMuse> If I've learned anything working for an airline, it is once a business learns they can get away with taking something away, it never comes back. Now that ZOOM is normalized, I don't see a lot of companies paying for office space, business travel, or even conventions anymore.
1332461550603538434 2020-11-28 07:09:24 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Always fun to hear a 30 year old white, male lawyer barely got approved by a co op board to rent a $1200 efficiency apartment in South Florida. So how do you think everyone else is doing? KILL THE OLDS.

1331843529950306305 2020-11-26 14:13:36 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @bnacker Pie hole of course.
1331752020362006536 2020-11-26 08:09:59 +0800 <YourComicMuse> One play of Blondie's "Call Me" in a convertible during sunny, warm November high season in South Florida is really better than heroin.
1331725184773066759 2020-11-26 06:23:20 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Drunk on the pier in Lauderdale By The Sea Florida. My absolute favorite Florida town, maybe my favorite American town. And I'd just like to say as the song in this bar is saying üé∂Well it's not far down to paradise at least it's not for me:)üé∂  https://t.co/V0YP6xjKYi
1331709094558900225 2020-11-26 05:19:24 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @Brian_J77 Sounds like a perfect plan. Getting something accomplished will feel good.
1331684832250880002 2020-11-26 03:43:00 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MarylandMudflap This is my kinda train of thought:)
1331668214217060355 2020-11-26 02:36:58 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Again, shout out everyone without family who aren't doing Thanksgiving. Share with me the non traditional holiday things you are doing. You are not alone. You aren't weird. I'll start. I just looked at a condo in Florida that I'm going to pass on, because of upstairs noise. You?
1331653189515481097 2020-11-26 01:37:15 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I like how all the shows are like "Don't gather for Thanksgiving! Stay home and stay safe. Listen to the CDC!" but then their next segment is "Here's how you plan Thanksgiving dinner for 20 people on a tight budget."
1331258398898327555 2020-11-24 23:28:30 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MattGoldich Whatever. I'm just a woman and so very tired. I am sorry for reply threading your funny tweet though.
1331257905874685955 2020-11-24 23:26:32 +0800 <YourComicMuse> If you see this picture and don't recognize the Southgate brand, you are very lucky and probably have enough money to go donate to a food charity.
1331256652457193473 2020-11-24 23:21:34 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MattGoldich Or a woman??? Crazy.
1331253822992379904 2020-11-24 23:10:19 +0800 <YourComicMuse> That feeling when you click on a new funny person's profile because they were retweeted into your timeline, and you see that they've followed you for a long time. And suddenly you are the Twitter version of the popular jock in a 90s movie who realizes the nerd girl is all that.
1331249134356008963 2020-11-24 22:51:41 +0800 <YourComicMuse> This holiday season seems even harder than usual for people who don't have family or are estranged from family and are alone. It seems like it'd be easier with so many normie families quarantined from each other but it's not somehow. Ain't that a son of a bitch? My DMs are open‚ù§
1331084680842465280 2020-11-24 11:58:12 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @usedwigs I'm sticking with George Constanza. Ride or die.
1331083383917617155 2020-11-24 11:53:03 +0800 <YourComicMuse> One of the worst things Trump did was leave the bar so low that Biden can be a moderate Republican for years that does nothing to change anything, but people will just be so relieved things feel normal again. And the media will just lap it all up.
1331082729283207168 2020-11-24 11:50:27 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @JimCramptonWPG Yes, but to the stars on here he is wonderful.
1330989774866300928 2020-11-24 05:41:05 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @Muqadaam Hi sweetie. You aren't alone. It will pass. Take it easy on yourself.
1330988929877647361 2020-11-24 05:37:44 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MrChuckMartin I only get a few sane calls a year. Can't waste them;)
1330985043083214848 2020-11-24 05:22:17 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I have to be a flight attendant this week. You can imagine who the passengers are that are still flying somewhere for Thanksgiving during the pandemic. I have to be an "essential worker" for assholes:(

1330541659554189313 2020-11-23 00:00:26 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MarylandMudflap Proof I agree;)  https://t.co/RUVKAvZVTb
1330338968022478848 2020-11-22 10:35:01 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Remember those years around "Sideways" when everyone took every bit of acting Paul Giamatti did way too seriously, and we had to watch him give millions of labored acceptance speeches at awards shows and now he's doing Volkswagen commercials?
1330335134814507012 2020-11-22 10:19:47 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @normsousa I think whatever name you go with, the container would be the best part. Like a pink plastic butt you squeeze and gum comes out.
1330331872665214977 2020-11-22 10:06:49 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @normsousa How about Butt Stuff?
1330330929303343105 2020-11-22 10:03:04 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Not even the finest chicken parmesan is worth how it makes the inside of your mask smell like puke.
1330327673751691267 2020-11-22 09:50:08 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Anyone else's favorite part of the day now right before falling asleep? I think if anything, the pandemic has made me very comfortable with the idea of dying in my sleep. To just keep sleeping &amp; not have to keep trying. Anyway, keep on with those endlessly fulfilling Trump jokes!
1330326036039553024 2020-11-22 09:43:37 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MtGayCreamSoda FWIW I always felt he and Creedence Clearwater Revival often down home backwoods posers in vocal styles &amp; lyrics. John Fogerty was born in Berkeley, CA not the Bayou. When Van Morrison wrote and recorded Brown Eyed Girl he was living well and very much by choice in Cambridge MA.
1330319537556901888 2020-11-22 09:17:48 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @amydillon Cheersü•É. We're all doing similar stuff. Don't feel weird‚ù§
1330315106924769280 2020-11-22 09:00:12 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @normsousa How about Bubble Butt? It's already a familiar phrase.
1330314766934478852 2020-11-22 08:58:51 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @jasonroeder I think a lot of him turning to the darkside is everyone refusing to call him Rick instead of Ricky when he got an adult cop role.
1330313855965257733 2020-11-22 08:55:13 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @jasonroeder And I'm sure Ricky believes it was meritocracy that earned him that role and money. That it shows why capitalism is great.
1330313140026929160 2020-11-22 08:52:23 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @JayJurden Truth
1330310972775555076 2020-11-22 08:43:46 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Not with leaders like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. Nope.
1330310563516313608 2020-11-22 08:42:08 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Just a reminder that the main thing we should've learned from covid is l everyone needs healthcare and sick leave. If uninsured, scared poor people keep getting covid then rich people with excellent healthcare still will get it too and be locked down. AKA Basic Jesus teachings.
1330308573944012802 2020-11-22 08:34:14 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Then why have things like open enrollment and other made up, only in America BS to keep people from having the healthcare they need? And why don't you retire so someone who actually cares can take over? #MedicareForAll
1330283207858786306 2020-11-22 06:53:26 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I had walking pneumonia in November of 2018. In July of 2019 I got a bill for $75 from the clinic. I called and asked why, and the clinic said they had gone back and forth with my insurance that whole time, but my insurance refused to cover that $75 of services. That's America!
1330230114945294342 2020-11-22 03:22:28 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @Rschooley Definitely Giuliani
1330228470803292162 2020-11-22 03:15:56 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @joshcomers I get it! That movie always gave me the creeps, and now I feel justified.
1329968358230536194 2020-11-21 10:02:20 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @VaguelyFunnyDan I don't think Gen X ever quite finished their essays.
1329964268532477954 2020-11-21 09:46:05 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @JayKogen Has anyone ever offered to cleanse your aura? If so, what did you do to get away from them, or did you just play along because it was a woman in college you wanted to sleep with or something?
1329962088853348354 2020-11-21 09:37:26 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @JayKogen Phantastic Phriend
1329957799388917760 2020-11-21 09:20:23 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @solomongeorgio Dope. I hope it's crunchberry Cap n' Crunch.
1329951936431484930 2020-11-21 08:57:05 +0800 <YourComicMuse> A full of malarkey start Joe. Are you this weak to stand up to Republicans like all the establishment dems, or just all out grifting? Either way most of us voted for you because we had no other choice. We're tapped out and afraid of homelessness at this point. Go fuck yourself.
1329936067450036225 2020-11-21 07:54:02 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I think @realDonaldTrump should follow the sound medical advice of @RandPaul. He has already had coronavirus, so he is immune now. Celebrate by being around Don Trump Jr. all the time while he recovers. No mask needed!
1329931558703263745 2020-11-21 07:36:07 +0800 <YourComicMuse> There is nothing current day more Wes Anderson than airport crew hotels. You have to trust me on this.
1329924258512957444 2020-11-21 07:07:06 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I remember the AIDS crisis. I remember people committing suicide up through the 2000s when diagnosed with AIDS. And at that point there were livable AIDS treatments. Think about how you'd really feel if you got COVID right now, before you go home for that dry Thanksgiving turkey.
1329919970524925957 2020-11-21 06:50:04 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Brie cheese
1329915003319808000 2020-11-21 06:30:20 +0800 <YourComicMuse> That would probably include me, if I'm really honest with myself, so definitely yes.
1329912170335899651 2020-11-21 06:19:04 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Has any else felt a real Jean Michel Basquiat quotient for possible happiness during covid times? I think if you wake up every day and pretend you are Jean Michel Basquiat you have a shot a happiness.
1329904758929416192 2020-11-21 05:49:37 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MarylandMudflap Fuck pussy raw! Oh wait, sorry, wrong website.
1329880341637632003 2020-11-21 04:12:36 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @rajandelman Lol
1329873617291767816 2020-11-21 03:45:52 +0800 <YourComicMuse> The fleet circles still bring me down, like a low popcorn ceiling.
1329866638938828805 2020-11-21 03:18:09 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I'll just throw this out there: You are no longer allowed to be a commercial airline pilot after age 65. That is the mandatory retirement age. No one seems to feel that's ageist, including every pilot I work with.
1329852893894238208 2020-11-21 02:23:32 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Joe Biden turns 78 today. I'm very glad he won, but 78. This country is being led by a handful of people the age of your relatives who sometimes can't remember your name.
1329843576021409795 2020-11-21 01:46:30 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @louisvirtel Jesus yes. Thank you.
1329803930956673025 2020-11-20 23:08:58 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I follow comedians &amp; comedy writers for this account, but it sucks a lot because they make fun of Trump and the GOP all day, but nothing remotely related to their career. Trump and the GOP deserve it of course, but there are celebrities, shows &amp; California politicians who do too.
1328840398240768000 2020-11-18 07:20:14 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @thatbilloakley Not to sound snotty, but I seriously can't believe you've never tried white anchovies. I imagine you've been to every kind of restaurant and dinner party. You've travelled. You had to have seen them on so many menus and in fish markets. I just don't get it. Sorry.
1328837632512512001 2020-11-18 07:09:14 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Good luck getting Nancy Pelosi to relentlessly go after jack shit ever.
1328833654349434882 2020-11-18 06:53:26 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Real question: Can you even tag someone in a fleet?
1328829982437638145 2020-11-18 06:38:50 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Has anyone else felt their sex spectrum expand during covid between the loneliness and alienation of quarantining, distancing, and not touching anyone? I've always had heterosexual sex, but lately so many women seem attractive. And also, men I normally would never be into at all.
1328827364432703488 2020-11-18 06:28:26 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @sadmonsters Lol. How about Aix en Provence?
1328825852679708675 2020-11-18 06:22:26 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Ok. I fleeted. It feels like taking a shit and then throwing it out a window and then hiding inside wondering where it will land and who will find it.
1328822570032918528 2020-11-18 06:09:23 +0800 <YourComicMuse> As a flight attendant during covid, I will say that on layovers in Vegas I finally have the Vegas pool experience I've always wanted.  https://t.co/RaHxJzdde4
1328819823296573441 2020-11-18 05:58:28 +0800 <YourComicMuse> If this is how Jack is looking these days, I guess I'm glad he's been busy creating fleets instead of kidnapping Elizabeth Smart.  https://t.co/tvFfVPki5L
1328812870902063104 2020-11-18 05:30:51 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Typical Twitter "improvement": I logged in for the first time since "fleeting" started. Trying to log in it first seemed like my account had been suspended. I thought "I knew this day would probably come," but fekt shocked and sad. Then my account rebooted with the awful circles.
1328810753810337792 2020-11-18 05:22:26 +0800 <YourComicMuse> This is the most accurate summary of 2020 I've seen.
1328643816530669569 2020-11-17 18:19:05 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I think this must at least be some kind of record.
1328634000093507584 2020-11-17 17:40:05 +0800 <YourComicMuse> The coolest online thing you could do right now is switch your email to Yahoo mail.
1328623304588988416 2020-11-17 16:57:35 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Watched a bit of @JKCorden &amp; holy moly @IanKarmel you have indeed lost a lot of weight. Didn't hardly recognize you. Are you just pulling an Adele or are you going to go full Khloe Kardashian? Anyway, I think you look great whatever weight, but if this is what you want congrats:)
1328488009784766469 2020-11-17 07:59:58 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Oh my gosh Avianca flight attendants. I know you guys hated wearing the hats with the old uniform dress, but the new red, skin tight, stretchy pants suit? I would hate that a lot more.
1328432299470368772 2020-11-17 04:18:35 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Harry Styles in a dress is an attack on masculinity! Says people following a man who wears heavy orange makeup, hairspray and hair dye, and who can't go down a flight of stairs without someone holding his hand.
1328418713419309056 2020-11-17 03:24:36 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @amydillon I'm so sorry Amy. For what it's worth I think it is completely insane that everyone assumes it can be normal or functional to expect children to interact with screens all the time, much less have it in any way count as a school environment. It should never have been assumed.
1328197579365113858 2020-11-16 12:45:54 +0800 <YourComicMuse> What concerns me about Parler is they can just be on Facebook &amp; say almost whatever they want to a vast audience of supporters. The only thing Facebook claims it won't allow now is actively, blatantly planning terrorism. Is that what they want to do, but they call it "uprising?"
1328194142757933057 2020-11-16 12:32:14 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @CanuckScots Not that it's still not horrible, but it would be 55% of American women who actually voted. Not all American women.
1328180450314096640 2020-11-16 11:37:50 +0800 <YourComicMuse> When I'm having to actively avoid learning whatever John Tesh did, I question spending time on the Twitter website.

1328153274252406785 2020-11-16 09:49:51 +0800 <YourComicMuse> To be fair though this looks like where you'd have your last dinner before entering the afterlife in a 1980s glam rock video.
1328147838711304193 2020-11-16 09:28:15 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @mrtimlong @TheSimpsons "I give your podcast 5 stars, but no comments in the comment section. Who has the time?" Lol.
1328146829150707715 2020-11-16 09:24:14 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @justinshanes Lindsey Buckingham has already said that a million times when they would disagree with him, so you'd be in good company:)
1328143040884695041 2020-11-16 09:09:11 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @justinshanes especially on that album. But when Lindsey is allowed to get too much in his own head ESPECIALLY with the weak influence of late 80s pop around him, he tends to way over produce stuff and get too technical and gamey with the sound board and effects. Just check out his solo stuff.
1328142382890700801 2020-11-16 09:06:34 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @justinshanes fuctioning. And I actually respect him for saving it and making it releasable and marketable. A big reason in fact I think it is ludicrous that they let Stevie kick him out of the band. He's saved their bacon many times, and played so many instruments and done so much production
1328141856841019393 2020-11-16 09:04:29 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @justinshanes Ugh. Yeah the intro is interesting. It's just really lifeless to me. Background music at a dentist's office I'm sorry. To me that album suffers because Buckingham had to basically complete it in studio in post all by himself because the rest of the band was no longer speaking or
1328137318130192384 2020-11-16 08:46:26 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @pattonoswalt TOTALLY. PERFECT.
1328136068433141761 2020-11-16 08:41:28 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @justinshanes Not trying to dog you, but if all the Christine McVie Fleetwood Mac songs...Everywhere? Sorry. I just think it's choked with over production. Would have picked Over My Head or Hold On To Me or anything else. Sorry, very passionate with ma Fleetwood Mac opinions;p

1328096390745108480 2020-11-16 06:03:49 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @primaltwit I don't think it's so twisted to want the biggest traitor in American history to get his due:)
1328070841385570306 2020-11-16 04:22:17 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @robertrea I was looking at the meat and gravy. Over there I don't think I've had roast that wasn't overdone or gravy that wasn't too thick. But, of course I've eaten it in restaurants.
1328067460243841024 2020-11-16 04:08:51 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @robertrea Holy cow. Yum. Looks like perfection.
1328063786800988160 2020-11-16 03:54:15 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I like to dream Vladimir Putin will poison Trump in that really obvious way he poisons people. I think it's remotely possible, because it would be an ultimate flex on America, and as time goes on Trump won't be as useful to him and possibly a loudmouth, desperate liability.

1328047407305805826 2020-11-16 02:49:10 +0800 <YourComicMuse> So are we ever going to get back to left shark Twitter? Probably not huh?
1328045345524297729 2020-11-16 02:40:58 +0800 <YourComicMuse> One of the main reasons I really can't wait for a vaccine is so I can take it and watch all the people who are going to refuse to take it die. Walking healthy among millions of dying anti-vaxxers is going to be a jam.
1328043686307966978 2020-11-16 02:34:23 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Shout out to everyone who has shitty families or no family who weren't going to see them anyway for the holidays, having to listen to all these spoiled, sheltered grown ass daddy and mommy girls and boys talk about their "sacrifice." Fuck all of you. Your life is a cakewalk.

1327775347547500544 2020-11-15 08:48:06 +0800 <YourComicMuse> As always, my disdain for real estate agents knows no bounds. Biggest normie lowlifes in America, and that's saying something.

1326304610034782210 2020-11-11 07:23:55 +0800 <YourComicMuse> It's a hell of a thing to criticize Republicans like Pompeo for backing Trump's coup when our Democratic Congress won't do anything to stop him or any of them.
1326284773606772737 2020-11-11 06:05:05 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I almost missed my Amtrak train from Fredericksburg VA to IAD airport in Washington DC. Now I'm flying from Washington DC to Charlotte NC. Then I have a tight last flight of the day connection to Memphis. And looking at Twitter is by far the most stressful thing I've done today.

1325966281191919617 2020-11-10 08:59:31 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Imagine being 74 year old Trump or 78 year old Mitch McConnell and destroying your country with a coup to cling to power when you could just be retired and sitting around drinking beer in your underwear.
1325945683426349056 2020-11-10 07:37:40 +0800 <YourComicMuse> One thing they reveal is the Four Seasons Total Landscaping story is being reported on by journalists as far as China. üé∂And I'm proud to be an American...üé∂
1325941155306082310 2020-11-10 07:19:40 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Hey @JimGaffigan I think the same ad man who came up with "By Mennan" and "Hot Pockets" came up with this.

1325900750187352067 2020-11-10 04:39:07 +0800 <YourComicMuse> These fucking people. And look at that very typical picture of Trump. Angry, pouting and wearing so much makeup. I just don't get why they'll do anything to look at that another 4 years.
1325897769882619910 2020-11-10 04:27:16 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Who says I haven't? (I haven't)
1325890552894791680 2020-11-10 03:58:36 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @RageMichelle I know some otherwise perfectly nice, and some of the most generous and active in charities people I know (one cuts hair for homeless people every Saturday and helps build houses for habitat for humanity) go that way:( Just from Facebook. All the ones I know get it from Facebook.
1325883118948134915 2020-11-10 03:29:03 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I'm very glad Biden got on TV and talked to America like a leader about covid. We need much more of this. Republicans are not going to stop dominating the news cycle and being aggressive. We need not just Biden, but all the Dems to start being MUCH more visible from now on.
1325872585628934144 2020-11-10 02:47:12 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Anyone else a little nervous this vengeful, treasonous clown is thinking about who his secretary of defense is as an unhinged lame duck?
1325870145122807809 2020-11-10 02:37:30 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Not even one reality show contestant??

1325860011592069121 2020-11-10 01:57:14 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Still will never forgive Ben Carson for making me learn a licensed, practicing brain surgeon can defiantly believe the pyramids stored grain, Obamacare is worse than slavery, and being gay is a choice, and who once on impulse tried to kill a friend with a knife.
1325828607554572289 2020-11-09 23:52:27 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @scharpling I think it would be about 49.02% of the customers unfortunately.
1325823284622094340 2020-11-09 23:31:18 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Hi @JohnKasich and @CNN, I'm a "far left" Democrat who wants wild, radical things like Medicare For All, work on climate change, racial equality, &amp; billionaires to pay their taxes. Can you help me locate some of these Trump supporters so I can listen to their ideas &amp; make amends?  https://t.co/CTfBJeP9lL
1325819797670662145 2020-11-09 23:17:26 +0800 <YourComicMuse> He thinks it is the Alamo. And Rudy Giuliani and Corey Lewandowski have scheduled him to make a speech about it at an Alamo car rental near the Newark airport.
1325617937508675587 2020-11-09 09:55:19 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @CooleyJscooley On the back of most fast food receipts is a BOGO coupon for doing a survey that people post the codes for online, so you don't have to really do it. At Chick Fil A, it's a free sandwich no purchase necessary. A lot of people leave their receipts on trays, or near the trash...

1325596338227122177 2020-11-09 08:29:30 +0800 <YourComicMuse> After Four Seasons Total Landscaping, I think every American should pay a $2 tax a year to pay @SachaBaronCohen to just play pranks on Rudy Giuliani every day. Just create a whole fake world he doesn't know he's in. It would be The Truman Show for an evil moron with dementia.
1325594782534668288 2020-11-09 08:23:19 +0800 <YourComicMuse> It's amazing how many white male politicians who have never been able to win their party's nomination CNN will trot out to tell us what this election is all about instead of people who were actually involved with it.

1325586039679963136 2020-11-09 07:48:34 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Alex Trebek is a gigantic loss to this proudly uneducated, obnoxious, impatient country.

1325314586376085504 2020-11-08 13:49:55 +0800 <YourComicMuse> This Foo Fighters song sucks, but I always do find comfort seeing that though grey haired and a bit wrinkled Pat Smear basically looks, plays and stands the exact same way he has for 30 years. #SNL
1325307285510496256 2020-11-08 13:20:54 +0800 <YourComicMuse> "I don't hate anybody. I just hate that feeling." First time Dave Chappelle has ever made me cry. Really exceptional stand up monologue even at his master level. #SNL
1325304779690663936 2020-11-08 13:10:57 +0800 <YourComicMuse> SNL should be paying all us Twitterers for writing their shows.
1325304231151198213 2020-11-08 13:08:46 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Dave Chappelle's bit about having to do a stand up show in a cornfield because of covid rules is pretty damn funny. #SNL
1325302300672483328 2020-11-08 13:01:06 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Wow. We say it here Twitterers, and SNL just steals it. They actually had Alec Baldwin dejectedly play Macho Man on a piano. Who was the first to tweet that?
1325299971533443072 2020-11-08 12:51:50 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Jesus Christ. You guys better have gotten someone better than Jim Carrey to play Biden.
1325298319598477314 2020-11-08 12:45:16 +0800 <YourComicMuse> While we wait out the stupid college football game for SNL, enjoy some celebration from the great Natasha, who tweeted at Donald Trump that he was trash every day for the last four years. And I faved or retweeted it every single time Natasha. Love you‚ù§
1325295985933869057 2020-11-08 12:36:00 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Love this. "Joe Biden a proud Irish American..."
1325295666671853568 2020-11-08 12:34:44 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Only NBC would be dumb enough to have SNL preempted tonight by a stupid college football game.
1325293461315211265 2020-11-08 12:25:58 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Ok here's a lot if it. Watchüëá
1325288876206919680 2020-11-08 12:07:45 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Wow. Don Lemon is GOING OFF, and I am here for it. "I have been in journalism since 1991 and I have never endured what I have the last 4 years. People screaming nig*er, fag, and fake news at me..." I mean he is on fire.
1325275804423639040 2020-11-08 11:15:48 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Seriously, like when @KeeganMKey did Angry Obama we need someone to do a Petty Biden sketch with Biden. Biden makes some classy speech and Petty Biden adds "oh and covfefe."
1325272927315632133 2020-11-08 11:04:22 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Definitely. And "You make my dreams come true" was perfect.
1325271303356620802 2020-11-08 10:57:55 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Car honks so much better than superspreader rednecks chanting lock her up. I hope all that shit finally ends. Jesus Christ.
1325268717945704448 2020-11-08 10:47:39 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @birbigs I don't know. Gonna be a while before I don't hate that color.
1325266438341480448 2020-11-08 10:38:35 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Yes. Whoever got Joe to run out there thank you. It was very important. I'm sorry we're in a crucial, fragile time and Biden needs to look bulletproof and strong. And I don't mean to "win Trumpers over," but to leave them no room in their their crazy heads to get their guns out.
1325264404477321217 2020-11-08 10:30:30 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @heykarlin Yes! I was thinking watching it that I hope American men finally realize sitting back and letting women lead is nice. I'm surprised a nation of lazy men that always want women to get on top during sex "because of their back" haven't gotten that somehow.
1325262671445438466 2020-11-08 10:23:37 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @AlbertBrooks I'm terrified.
1325261324071428097 2020-11-08 10:18:16 +0800 <YourComicMuse> So crazy watching this and thinking about "family values" Republicans ignoring Trump's frowning, 3rd wife who has porn shots all over the internet jerk her hand away if he even tried to touch her.
1325259361170677760 2020-11-08 10:10:28 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Also kind of nice to have a President and Vice President who have bothered to, you know, hold other offices first. That know how the government works, and have at least read the constitution.
1325257166949937155 2020-11-08 10:01:45 +0800 <YourComicMuse> God this is so wondefully normal! To all of us who have been in abusive situations (and now we all have after the last 4 years) it is such a recognizable feeling when you finally get free of it and know you are getting away from the abuser.
1325255951650320384 2020-11-08 09:56:55 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Ok! That went well. Got a little nervous when he started a grandpap story at the end. But it was short, sweet and coherent. Thank you God. I think he can do this. I think he can pull this country out of this holeü§ûü§ûü§ûü§û
1325252493387902977 2020-11-08 09:43:11 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Ok. Biden's doing really well! He sounds very alert and clear and looks really the best I've seen him look. I'm very relieved so farü§ûü§ûü§û
1325251847163146244 2020-11-08 09:40:37 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Ok. Here he comes. God I'm so nervous. God please give Joe strong speaking skills tonight. We need him. Bless his voice and mind.
1325250011974742017 2020-11-08 09:33:19 +0800 <YourComicMuse> God I wish Kamala was going to be President. I know, I know. I'm glad we at least got rid of the evil one. I just tense up worrying about Biden gaffing out every time he speaks. We need a strong speaker. But I'll think positive I promise.
1325248836126855168 2020-11-08 09:28:39 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Very good to lead with Kamala. She's got the charisma for tonight's energy. Good start!
1325246411353546758 2020-11-08 09:19:01 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Ha! This clip makes me like Biden A LOT MORE. Thank you for sharing Trump's hated racist, Russian stooge British pal.
1325242656209899520 2020-11-08 09:04:05 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Hey @CNN having Rick Santorum on FOR HOURS ON END assuring your viewers "that Biden can compromise" is the weakest, most inappropriate, offensive, mood killing shit you could have cooked up. I mean it takes your level of incompetent, complicit trash to come up with that.

1325195374567460867 2020-11-08 05:56:12 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @JimCramptonWPG Lol. Thanks. I think it's only like 50.08%. But I'm trying not to think about that tonight‚ù§
1325190886200803328 2020-11-08 05:38:22 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @mrtimlong In time. First a bogus recount.
1325190674279510017 2020-11-08 05:37:32 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @HelloCullen Lmao. Best, most apt tweet of the day. üèÖ
1325188414111686656 2020-11-08 05:28:33 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Get in loser, forget honking WE'RE GOING DRINKING. AND I MEAN DRUNKEDY DRUNK DRINK. ING.  Oh, and by get in I mean a Lyft. Because of course drink responsibly and tip your drivers!
1325186622615392257 2020-11-08 05:21:26 +0800 <YourComicMuse> A First lady who likes her husband and us, speaks English, has never posed nude for cheap beaver shots, isn't a birther racist, never lied about illegally immigrating here, has never worn a "I don't really care do u?" jacket visting concentration camps, AND isn't a Russian spy!
1325184599690006528 2020-11-08 05:13:23 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Seriously @nbcsnl are you really going to let @JimCarrey do his shitty Joe Biden tonight? You are complicit in getting us Trump, you could at least do the right thing and get a proper impression and sketch tonight. I love you @JimCarrey but you suck at this, step down.
1325181761769234434 2020-11-08 05:02:07 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Things that MUST change after complicit cable news for four years: Get rid of the Wolf Blitzers and Chuck Todds and put in people like @camanpour and @Yamiche to host if they'll do it. Get rid of irrelevant, shitty Rick Santorum, Chris Christie commentary and get Stacey Abrams.
1325178508876902400 2020-11-08 04:49:11 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I'm actually for a lot of hanging Mussolini type violence right now. It's entirely warranted. That's how I roll. If we're not getting it, we should at least get to see @Travon just mercilessly kick Jared Kushner's ass. Would anyone, even his own family, really object to that?
1325163335231238144 2020-11-08 03:48:54 +0800 <YourComicMuse> and brand us "antifa." There is absolutely no reason to decrease the pressure now. No justice no peace if shown as continuous until REAL change occurs is the way to go. Anyway, love you guys. And yes, we are better off. ‚ù§
1325162791385378816 2020-11-08 03:46:44 +0800 <YourComicMuse> thinking what if we kept up the same or MORE of the Black Lives Matter, women's rights, anti-fascist protests NOW? And added in some worker's rights voices? Some general strikes? This new administration would have to at least acknowledge and address us. To not just lie (10/?)

Be active in your union and unionize if you haven't already.  Be ready to strike and take to the streets even MORE now than under Trump. I've been (9?)
1325160580576141312 2020-11-08 03:37:57 +0800 <YourComicMuse> There's of course a lot more I could say, but this is a big, good, desperately needed win in the context of Trump and the never before seen insane, extremist, criminal climate he has created in this country. It sucks our expectations have had to be brought so low because (8/?)
1325158567901589510 2020-11-08 03:29:57 +0800 <YourComicMuse> with such a shiftless, timid, detached, lazy, unreliable Democratic congress we need the Senate desperately to get anything done. As working people we need such an overwhelming majority to get anything remotely near basic rights in this country as you might have noticed;) (7/?)
1325157824591142912 2020-11-08 03:27:00 +0800 <YourComicMuse> 4 years we would be stripped bare of anything and possibly any remnant of this country and democracy. Yes these are big sweeping problems, but that's where the right gas gotten us. Please do anything you can to aid in the Senate runoff underway. Without the senate and such (6/?)

Also perhaps most importantly, Trump and his cronies are proven treasonous crooks. They have done irreparable harm to our democracy and standing in the world, and another (5/?)
1325155580831387648 2020-11-08 03:18:05 +0800 <YourComicMuse> But, Biden at least, feels our pressure a little and from in his own party. From AOC and the squad to Bernie he is at least obligated to pretend to listen and sometimes even act on our needs. I know a lot of it feels like abstractions and all talk, but tone matters. And a (4/?)

This guy will probably fall short on racism and treatment of women and working people, god knows he has in the past (Anita Hill, social security etc.) (3/?)
1325152937845403650 2020-11-08 03:07:35 +0800 <YourComicMuse> As women we have an advocate at least (maybe) to try to get back all the health benefits Trump and this GOP Senate immediately took away (the first thing they did.) As women again, if this guy packs the court we have a shot at keeping Roe. Vs. Wade. Our brothers and sisters (2/?)
1325151771317186561 2020-11-08 03:02:57 +0800 <YourComicMuse> If you are jaded working class thinking "My life's not really going to change." I feel you. Just remember our unions are much safer now, our gay friends who have gotten married and have families have a shot at keeping their rights if we can get this guy to pack the court. (1/?)
1324913853784842242 2020-11-07 11:17:33 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @AnthonyDeVito Lmao.
1324892023569182721 2020-11-07 09:50:48 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I honestly need and want to look back at congressmen and other elected officials pre-Trump and then pre-internet and social media all together and see if as many total idiotic nutbags held office. Did we just not hear about them? We now have Qanon in Congress after this election.
1324890191107149824 2020-11-07 09:43:31 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MrChuckMartin Exactly.
1324889350006509568 2020-11-07 09:40:10 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MrChuckMartin No, they just go to mom and pop corner coffee shops instead of Starbucks according to Tucker Carlson. When in reality where they live in suburban, big box store, chain restaurant, Costco land, the corner coffee shop is Starbucks. And they love it because they have terrible taste.
1324887332319793152 2020-11-07 09:32:09 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Guarantee more Republicans drink Starbucks than Democrats.
1324881555593039879 2020-11-07 09:09:12 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @pweingard @thatbilloakley And of course Craig Kilborn hosted right after Snyder and before Ferguson.
1324879534752223233 2020-11-07 09:01:10 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @pweingard @thatbilloakley In the 90s once Letterman went to CBS, and mainly because Snyder was someone Letterman really admired for the Tomorrow Show, Letterman pulled Snyder out of mothballs and got him a show on CBS. It was the Late, Late Show which then Craig Ferguson hosted and now James Corden hosts.
1324877744245788672 2020-11-07 08:54:03 +0800 <YourComicMuse> If you are starting to get agitated waiting for them to call it, just sit back and be glad we're having our first Chris Matthews free election. Can you fucking imagine listening to his bullshit right now?
1324876204323844096 2020-11-07 08:47:56 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Again, why was Rick Santorum chosen by @CNN to cover 60% of their election conmentary and analysis? All the people they could have picked. I honestly want to know what the process was.
1324874584462675971 2020-11-07 08:41:30 +0800 <YourComicMuse> *Sigh* FYI: Not that they weren't funny the first 800 times but these tweets HAVE BEEN DONE: 1)Comparing waiting for the race to be called to edging or any delayed orgasm. 2)You can pronouce Kamala Madame Vice President 3)The cowboy lawyer looks like a pedo AND a child.

1324872360860782593 2020-11-07 08:32:40 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @robertdsheridan I also had a dream a hamburger was eating me!

1324870940715520003 2020-11-07 08:27:01 +0800 <YourComicMuse> You know if we all log off Twitter and turn off the TV they'll call it.
1324870471909826560 2020-11-07 08:25:10 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I wonder if Elon Musk would be anything if his name was like Fred Henderson.
1324854594346905601 2020-11-07 07:22:04 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Come on @ConanOBrien, can we have a little of your Trump? You were so far ahead of everyone else and had him pegged years in advance at the height of his NBC popularity. We could use some levity while we wait for the count.  https://t.co/NQ48CECbwF
1324849563790942209 2020-11-07 07:02:05 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MKupperman I love that he thinks no one noticed, when you know they noticed and just didn't want to hear him talk about why.

1324847051511877632 2020-11-07 06:52:06 +0800 <YourComicMuse> BBC World News just called America "a land of ambient ugliness." Boy do I miss going to England and fucking British guys:(

1324837635974713345 2020-11-07 06:14:41 +0800 <YourComicMuse> They're going to demand a recount for phony reasons no matter when they call it, so they might as well call it so we can get on with it.

1324769297177202689 2020-11-07 01:43:08 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Ah. Rand Paul spreading disinformation. Rand Paul is a very likely candidate to pick up leadership of Trumpism now. "The Senator from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin...and I do not say that lightly." -John McCain on the Senate floor March 15, 2017.

1324752498352115712 2020-11-07 00:36:22 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @billprady Bill, Trump's slogan for 5 years was "Fuck Your Feelings." Stop giving in to them.
1324751110821810177 2020-11-07 00:30:52 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Stressed out Nevada promises to finish counting as soon as they return a tiger to Mike Tyson and find Doug.
1324749622481457154 2020-11-07 00:24:57 +0800 <YourComicMuse> One of your party's main campaign slogans we've had to see on t-shirts, hats, signs and bumperstickers for 5 years is "Fuck Your Feelings" @RickSantorum. So sincerely, Fuck Your Feelings.
1324748268518182913 2020-11-07 00:19:34 +0800 <YourComicMuse> If they replaced Rick Santorum's name with Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein or Chuck Schumer you wouldn't be surprised right? Anyway fuck this shit and everyone who spouts it. Fuck them.
1324746036359974918 2020-11-07 00:10:42 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Now that Pelosi, Schumer and the rest of the establishment Democrats can't pretend they have to be pussies and turn a blind eye to Trump's daily crimes to appeal to his shitty voters, it sure would be nice if they did their job and held him accountable as a lame duck.
1324743040049778688 2020-11-06 23:58:47 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Forget having to drag him out of the White House, he may very well end up killed with a crossbow in a sauna,  if he's outlived his usefulness.
1324624157481553922 2020-11-06 16:06:24 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Honestly we've all been there at some point. Not at her level of course, but we have.
1324623609625796608 2020-11-06 16:04:13 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MrEmilyHeller Man if you can go to bed go to bed. None of us think anyone who can sleep should stay up at this point. We just wish we could too.
1324621667553943553 2020-11-06 15:56:30 +0800 <YourComicMuse> If Biden wins Georgia I'll lick a hairy peach until it becomes a W.A.P.

1324615885215141889 2020-11-06 15:33:31 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @show_sea Don't worry honey. Really just a sitz bath. Just a couple of inches of hot water to relax my back and butt. To drown I would literally have to turn all the way over, become a foot shorter and lay completely facedown flat.
1324614259687460865 2020-11-06 15:27:04 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Welp. 2 a.m. Time to sit in a bath with a glass of wine, because apparently I can't even bring myself to masturbate to get myself to sleep. Hopefully, I'll drown. Since covid quarantine, social distancing and now the election, not only fucking but even masturbating is ruined.
1324605551163117568 2020-11-06 14:52:28 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Trump from here on out is just DeNiro as Al Capone screaming "You're nothing but a lot of talk and a badge!" in The Untouchables as he's dragged out of the courtroom, but for months and months:(  https://t.co/UPnT1rhJRX
1324600434917605377 2020-11-06 14:32:08 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I of course wanted an irrefutable Biden landslide on the 3rd. But if there is any chance the orange one gets a second term, I'm realizing it's best I have a few days to watch it happen, rather than the sudden shock in 2016 that left me bedridden for days.
1324598510478626817 2020-11-06 14:24:29 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @thatbilloakley Oh I didn't stay up for those. I've never gotten the appeal of Bob Costas. I'm a woman who isn't particularly interested in sports or his type of interview. Just wanted my Letterman sticking to the velcro wall, Larry Bud Melman et al;)
1324595787054153729 2020-11-06 14:13:40 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @thatbilloakley This made me so nostalgic for this small TV with a giant tube at its back I used to watch on the floor next to my bed when I was supposed to be asleep. I went to school exhausted for years because of Letterman.
1324588486666629126 2020-11-06 13:44:39 +0800 <YourComicMuse> They're in Vegas. It would be funnier and more appropriate if they did this at Trump's tacky hotel.
1324587075488854016 2020-11-06 13:39:03 +0800 <YourComicMuse> And renewing their driver's license, and registering their car, and doing their taxes, and buying everything they own, and showing people on social media everything they do and think every single day, and letting Google know their location and every website they visit, and...
1324580340753670144 2020-11-06 13:12:17 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Kornacki has become Belushi to the rest of us laying around exhausted and despondent in the Delta house.  https://t.co/G8KENMtG6y
1324576552202457091 2020-11-06 12:57:14 +0800 <YourComicMuse> How he is not in prison by now is one way we got Trump.

1324560774472359939 2020-11-06 11:54:32 +0800 <YourComicMuse> If Biden wins Pennsylvania the Electoral College will let America have a little democracy as a treat.

Then we can enjoy our big true West vibe blue block. And the red assholes of Utah and Arizona will be next to dumbfuck midwest rednecks where they belong.  https://t.co/pQ8M0zmwZD
1324557058507743232 2020-11-06 11:39:46 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @robertrea I thought maybe you had special dispensation being a journalist and all:)
1324554928677859328 2020-11-06 11:31:18 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @robertrea Are you in England or the states?
1324548374826307584 2020-11-06 11:05:16 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @sadmonsters Is there a slim margin chance that instead of noodles you decide on a late vote matzo ball dump instead, which if you have the ingredients to make I would choose over noodles?
1324546643698606080 2020-11-06 10:58:23 +0800 <YourComicMuse> One of the worst things about Trump, Giuliani, Rand Paul and so many other Republicans working for Putin is at least Putin works very hard and loyally for Russia. Putin would never betray Russia for America.
1324531988347396097 2020-11-06 10:00:09 +0800 <YourComicMuse> In 4 months Trump will have a show on RT. As a lame duck, I honestly won't be surprised if he appears on RT dogging America.

1324528300790865921 2020-11-06 09:45:30 +0800 <YourComicMuse> All of this stress about Allentown at least reminds me that this tweet by @Mobute is still the funniest tweet to me of all time. I still don't know why, it just is.
1324525692671954944 2020-11-06 09:35:08 +0800 <YourComicMuse> So true. "Against the assault of laughter, nothing can stand." - Mark Twain
1324523661123006467 2020-11-06 09:27:03 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Lmao. What in the h*ll happened to you girl? Seriously, what do they have on you?
1324513511284871172 2020-11-06 08:46:44 +0800 <YourComicMuse> And impeachable Russian influence to instill discord in our election process, that the GOP Senate allowed to stay in office.

1324510066377134080 2020-11-06 08:33:02 +0800 <YourComicMuse> 2 Things: 1) I guarantee if Democrats were smart enough to do election fraud the Senate would have flipped and McConnell and Graham would have lost. 2) Trump is working for Russia to undermine America. Go back and read all the evidence proven true in the impeachment trial.

1324249272892665856 2020-11-05 15:16:44 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I think it's time for CNN to change the listing title "Election Night In America" to "Election Week One In America."

I think Jayne Mansfield would be really proud of Mariska   Blue jeans with non fucked with denim need to come back.
1324221329080569862 2020-11-05 13:25:42 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @sadmonsters 2 takeaways: I hope you aren't making a correlation between the likelihood of bigfoot being real &amp; the likelihood of Biden winning. 2. Other men your age must really envy all your hair. It's like you're dripping with this asset that you don't even care or know what to do with.
1324219523155828737 2020-11-05 13:18:31 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Everyone giving into the rehabilitation of Shepard Smith. As someone who's spent my whole adult life working with gay men, there's nothing as awful as a gay diehard Republican. They're mean climbers who have no loyalty, and will cut you. They like GOP sexism too, you can feel it.
1324214578524377088 2020-11-05 12:58:52 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MKupperman Oof. And that "Way to go Gorgeous." Is he doing Barbra Streisand in Funny Girl or just being a creepy sexist that thinks he's empowering a woman who's been groped or something? Just gross all around.
1324198303945400320 2020-11-05 11:54:12 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I could definitely see Rand Paul picking up where Trump leaves off. He's got it all - a tea party originator, Russian ties to the point McCain stood on the floor of the senate and said he was working for Russia.
1324195555057278976 2020-11-05 11:43:17 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @robertrea Did you know a group of zebra is called a dazzle? Did you know a group of ravens is called an unkindness? These are not I learned in school.
1324172235981180932 2020-11-05 10:10:37 +0800 <YourComicMuse> BREAKING! IMPORTANT RESULT: I came in 2nd in a bar trivia night tonight, mainly because I didn't know a group of parrots is called a "pandemonium." I'd rather come in dead last than a close second.  https://t.co/847iwA9Jca

1324121491051581442 2020-11-05 06:48:59 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Has anyone tried to tell Trump to be a good sport?
1324100551492198402 2020-11-05 05:25:46 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Attention: Anyone watching this election, and every election. Anyone who hates gerrymandering. Anyone who has tried to accomplish anything at a DMV during covid.  Wouldn't it be nice not to have counties?
1324090978857340931 2020-11-05 04:47:44 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @mrbenwexler Ain't no Stockholm Syndrome like Dem Stockholm Syndrome. We better toughen up and snap out of it, because the Republicans are never going to change. They'll always fight dirty.
1324086662763335680 2020-11-05 04:30:35 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @sadmonsters Michael Cohen's book. There's just too much detail and evidence and provable events in it to be wrong.
1324086333539844106 2020-11-05 04:29:16 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @sadmonsters It also just seems, as it has throughout, that he has tried to sew chaos, disruption and faith in our basic institutions the way someone working for Putin would. Call me whatever you like, but it was proven in the impeachment trial he is working with Russia. And I also read
1324075793820143617 2020-11-05 03:47:24 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @JimCramptonWPG And you're Canadian, think how traumatized I feel.
1324075627306168322 2020-11-05 03:46:44 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Weird thing, if you turn off the TV and your phone and walk down the street to get tacos it's like there isn't an insane election you have to hear about.
1324054972758151168 2020-11-05 02:24:39 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Yes. Yes. Yes. MUST WATCH. He breaks down how from the Tea Party to Trumpism, this has been about white nationalism. And Trump is just a manifestation of actual people, who will not go away when he leaves.
1324051787129724928 2020-11-05 02:12:00 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Shout out to all of us getting through this with only alcohol and Zzzquil, because we have jobs where we get tested, so we can't do drugs. AND who have not gotten prescription meds like Xanax because between trying to get a doctor appt. during covid &amp; insurance it's not worth it.
1324049014250229767 2020-11-05 02:00:59 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @mrtimlong Or at least be out there talking to the American people like a winner and a confident, inspiring leader.
1324048672846450695 2020-11-05 01:59:37 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @mrtimlong Exactly.
1324040066390478850 2020-11-05 01:25:25 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Its ok if you aren't in a hurry today to just stand in the shower in the dark and stare at the wall while the water hits your back for a long while.
1324034852845318144 2020-11-05 01:04:42 +0800 <YourComicMuse> This is all on you @DNC. Do not ever put a Hillary or Biden over other passionate, energetic, fresh, dynamic candidates ever again who CAMPAIGN HARD and MOVE PEOPLE'S HEARTS AND MINDS. Do not ever stop a primary before completion again. There were so many strong candidates.
1323835323831472128 2020-11-04 11:51:51 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @sadmonsters If our whole life depends on "suburban Pennsylvania women" what are we exactly?
1323833440647733249 2020-11-04 11:44:22 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @sadmonsters Seriously what are we going to do if the Dems can't even pull this one through?
1323832865814097923 2020-11-04 11:42:05 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I'm trying to picture "suburban women of Pennsylvania" upon whom my life now apparently depends. All I picture are maybe some Karens  power walking in a forest? That's all I got.

1323828121729191938 2020-11-04 11:23:14 +0800 <YourComicMuse> So now we lost Doug Jones' Alabama senate seat. Two steps forward two steps back.

1323817567564128256 2020-11-04 10:41:18 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Bill Clinton, a governor from Arkansas, won against Ronald Reagan's VP incumbent Bush Sr. He won AGAIN after impeachment. Barack Hussein Obama handily beat John McCain in a landslide AND won a 2nd term easily. Yet, the DNC learned nothing of fresh, energetic, positive charisma.
1323815461599981568 2020-11-04 10:32:56 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @JimCramptonWPG Chuck Todd??? I'd rather die.
1323813649576853505 2020-11-04 10:25:43 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @robertrea I could see all this coming. I told you I was worried. I'm just praying for Ohio and Pennsylvania.
1323812687214772224 2020-11-04 10:21:54 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @BlitznBeans I blame the DNC for pushing the weakest candidate I've seen in my lifetime (except maybe Dukakis, but at least Dukakis campaigned.)
1323809228738465797 2020-11-04 10:08:09 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I will never forgive the DNC for this if we lose. All we needed was a candidate that was healthier, better spoken and more energetic than Donald Trump. And that would at least campaign. That's it.
1323808167961264130 2020-11-04 10:03:57 +0800 <YourComicMuse> If Arizona goes blue, I promise not to tweet my sheer hatred for the entire McCain family for four years. It will be one of the hardest things I've ever done, but I promise.
1323807433140150279 2020-11-04 10:01:01 +0800 <YourComicMuse> If Ohio goes blue I'll eat Drew Carey's ass.

1323806719013781506 2020-11-04 09:58:11 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @robertrea Robert I've gone beyond panicked terror to depressed and flushed red with fear. Tell me something good:(

1323803748377001986 2020-11-04 09:46:23 +0800 <YourComicMuse> The "doctor" who said Trump was in perfect physical condition, weighed 240 lbs. and is several inches taller than he obviously is.
1323802851638956033 2020-11-04 09:42:49 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Not to bum everyone out, but if we don't flip the senate and Trump wins again what do we do? I think part of the anxiety is none of us even let ourselves think about it. Just pushed it out of our minds. But how would we proceed with our lives as they completely run roughshod?
1323796865993900032 2020-11-04 09:19:02 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Welp. Mitch McConnell, 78 years old, again. The most pervasively evil, harmful person in government. Forget Florida, let's get rid of Kentucky.
1323791146288582656 2020-11-04 08:56:18 +0800 <YourComicMuse> If Biden wins it will be wow, someone can win who did almost no campaigning. If Biden loses it will be, well I guess he should have maybe campaigned.
1323789479530946560 2020-11-04 08:49:41 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Forget pizza to the polls. How about masseuses to Democrats who voted while they watch election night results? How about therapists to Democrats for life?
1323784833500327937 2020-11-04 08:31:13 +0800 <YourComicMuse> So I go to PBS to calm my nerves and they're doing extended one on one analysis with Trump's campaign manager.  https://t.co/IomjGN2zbM
1323783223105736704 2020-11-04 08:24:49 +0800 <YourComicMuse> It's too bad the dramatic music, graphics and everyone else on CNN sucks, because John King is the kind of dry turkey sandwich that could've gotten me through this. Anyway over to PBS where hopefully my nerves won't be as shot.
1323779707247222784 2020-11-04 08:10:51 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Tallahassee is blue? Who knew. I will take it.
1323778930688577536 2020-11-04 08:07:46 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @sadmonsters I'm physically, visibly squirming.
1323778425748938753 2020-11-04 08:05:45 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I don't man. I don't know if I can watch us lose again. I can't have him be President for 4 more years. I just can't. At least during Bush I could leave the country. We're all trapped by covid.
1323772418708672513 2020-11-04 07:41:53 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @hellolanemoore I wish I could. I don't think my body will fall asleep.
1323766890523742208 2020-11-04 07:19:55 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Lmao. This country is a pretend, Truman Show democracy where sometimes the truth comes through while someone's not paying attention.
1323764859666894851 2020-11-04 07:11:51 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Just heard Jake Tapper utter his first "Trump is only winning non college educated white males by 20% this time. He won them by 32% in 2016." And my soul just sort of left my body and hovered just over my bed for a few minutes. My soul may leave this country even without my body.
1323763597772808193 2020-11-04 07:06:50 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Nice big blue wave. You are one sharp tack Marco Rubio.
1323761686357172229 2020-11-04 06:59:14 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Would do anything for Jaime Harrison to win this and make a speech about how white people can live in South Carolina as long as they are decent and not racist.

1323730480412446721 2020-11-04 04:55:14 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Ahhh...just in time to have done tons of damage that can't be undone now.

1323719186607185928 2020-11-04 04:10:22 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I've been sitting outside in the sun drinking for the last few hours. My anxiety is cut in half with the Vitamin D, fresh air, booze and lack of claustrophobic walls that feel like they're crashing in. Highly recommend today. 5 stars.

1323714484775641093 2020-11-04 03:51:41 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Election day &amp; I'm drinking accordingly. As a break, I feel it's important to share that though I have the mantle of being from Memphis, I feel this is the best Tina Turner song. Enjoy. Especially @MarylandMudflap who I think will really enjoy this video.  https://t.co/rIBr5ASjrv
1323708723236380673 2020-11-04 03:28:47 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Remember that viral video in 2016 of people from all around the world saying "Don't do it America" discouraging voting for Trump? How bad is it that no one is even bothering to do that anymore?
1323704664727212032 2020-11-04 03:12:39 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Thanks Michael. Would have enjoyed seeing you mercilessly, articulately wipe the floor with Donald Trump campaigning, in interviews and in debates as the Democratic candidate. You would have easily won this election. But, because the DNC just had to have Joe we wait terrified‚ù§

1323654271884288002 2020-11-03 23:52:25 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I've got to trade positions on the airplane with a flight attendant friend before I drop a trip for another one. She is junior to me and can't hold my cushy back of the plane position, and I promised her I would.
1323521837628825602 2020-11-03 15:06:10 +0800 <YourComicMuse> It's weird waiting to see a presidential election determine if being intelligent and sane instead of crazy and stupid will be valued again.

1323512366332547074 2020-11-03 14:28:32 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @robertdsheridan Yes! And I've actually watched that episode enough that you can tell Jerry is on the verge of breaking while she's saying all of it. Look at his face next time.
1323511701954809860 2020-11-03 14:25:54 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @robertdsheridan Marlene was one of the few Seinfeld gfs who made me laugh in her own right when she said she had to break up with Jerry because she saw his act and "it was just so much fluff" in that southern accent.

1323508891985072128 2020-11-03 14:14:44 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Does it make sense that I think I would be 50% less stressed tomorrow if the sun never came up, and it was dark all day? Where is late stage Elvis when you need him to relate to a tweet?

1323496374399361024 2020-11-03 13:24:59 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I know I'm fine because Stephen Colbert just asked Cher how she is dealing with her election anxiety and she said "I have a ring that says FEAR NOT  and try to live by that" and I started tearing up again.
1323482781536706560 2020-11-03 12:30:58 +0800 <YourComicMuse> If you are experiencing anxiety, lower the lights in your room, turn the TV down and concentrate on something small, tactile and comforting. Rub your hand on your sheets or pillows while looking at them. Concentrate on the details of an object like a chair. Breathe‚ù§
1323481490060173313 2020-11-03 12:25:50 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Because I grew up hiding under my bed reading, while my selfish baby boomer parents would constantly fight as they headed to an obviously inevitable divorce to everyone but them, I feel somewhat prepared for tomorrow.

1323443489863065600 2020-11-03 09:54:51 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @ScottLinnen Thank you. I just hope we pull this through. This is going to be unrecoverable if we don't I hate to say. I'm praying hard and drinking hard, and trying to be there for the most fragile people.‚ù§

1323438638722699264 2020-11-03 09:35:34 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @ScottLinnen I love you Scott. I know we are traumatized and bruised, but I'm glad we're still here. We're going to get through this. We have to. ‚ù§

1323437217277161479 2020-11-03 09:29:55 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MarylandMudflap Hell yeah.

1323431665214042114 2020-11-03 09:07:51 +0800 <YourComicMuse> This will be the 3rd presidential election I've been on Twitter, and I can sadly guarantee you tomorrow the last several hours will be entirely "STAY IN LINE" tweets. But this is the first time I worry that corrupt precincts won't even honor the longstanding cruel wait to vote.
1323429603453620226 2020-11-03 08:59:40 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @FBSisnothere @EricStangel Perfect. Love you sweetie. We're going to get through this‚ù§

1323426496241958914 2020-11-03 08:47:19 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Exactly. Perfect.
1323425987128864768 2020-11-03 08:45:18 +0800 <YourComicMuse> And very proud to be one of the first states to vote to eliminate the electoral college and make a vote equal an actual vote. Seriously, fuck you Draft Kings üñï
1323425069805277184 2020-11-03 08:41:39 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @jcgreen @EricStangel Perfect:)
1323424279141224449 2020-11-03 08:38:30 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I'm a flight attendant. And I am inviting you all to be one with me tonight and tomorrow. The plane is coming in for a crash landing, and it is up to us to get everyone to safety and take care of each other. People are going to panic and act crazy. Be a cooler head that helps‚ù§
1323422822212030465 2020-11-03 08:32:43 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @amydillon And I like lutefisk! And salty fish really:)
1323422415687475201 2020-11-03 08:31:06 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @jojomar1960 We just have to stick together. I've learned that being a Colorado democrat. I've learned that being a union member flight attendant. We have to try to take care of likeminded people who keep us sane and safe. Or they will run us to destruction so quickly. DM me anytime sweetie‚ù§
1323421201583214595 2020-11-03 08:26:17 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Well, you guys I know Twitter has been an excruciating shitstorm for 4 years. But tonight, I can tell we're all grateful to at least have each other, and that we're all for the most part still here. We'll stick together and get through this. My DMs are open if you feel scared‚ù§
1323419921297084417 2020-11-03 08:21:11 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @scullymike Lol. Thanks for getting a chuckle out of me on here when I don't think it's possible, always:)
1323419095736426499 2020-11-03 08:17:55 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @johnlevenstein Exactly. It's like putting a lock on a plastic bag.

1323415931134070784 2020-11-03 08:05:20 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @amydillon I don't apologize for bringing the bratwurst and beer. Good stuff. And I just wish I could bring Angela Merkel:)
1323415033251008512 2020-11-03 08:01:46 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @chefjoseandres God bless you Jose. You have been so brave, true and clear from the minute Trump reared his ugly campaign. You broke your contract with him knowing he would sue and retaliate. You have walked and acted righteously with no fear. Thank you. You always make me feel safer‚ù§
1323412867195015168 2020-11-03 07:53:10 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Ok. Just seeing this made me burst into tears. I am going to be a blubbering mess tomorrow. Please God let them all be voted out.
1323403627415949314 2020-11-03 07:16:27 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @BrianStack153 @MrsSteveMOBrien I once saw Jane Krakowski coming out of a bathroom stall in a pub in London's West End.
1323402444005662723 2020-11-03 07:11:44 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MattGoldich Lmao. It was nice knowing you.

1323393972320940033 2020-11-03 06:38:05 +0800 <YourComicMuse> So proud of Colorado. Proud of us when we were the first to legalize pot. Proud of us when Bernie won the primary in 2016 and 2020. And proud of this. Colorado stands alone so many times, we're used to it. Oh, and fuck you Draft Kingsüñï
1323391143145545728 2020-11-03 06:26:50 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @primaltwit Thanks sweetie. You doing alright tonight? At least we have Twitter huh?
1323390138332925952 2020-11-03 06:22:51 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @hellolanemoore Well said Lane‚ù§
1323384823117975554 2020-11-03 06:01:43 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I just keep coming back to Trump being so obviously compromised by getting bailed out by Russia. His possibilty for a normal life is over, so he doesn't care or want normal things for anyone. He is misery loves company in Manchurian Candidate form.
1323383802627035141 2020-11-03 05:57:40 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MrGeorgeWallace I love you George‚ù§
1323369572200812544 2020-11-03 05:01:07 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @scullymike @GOP I know. Everywhere I went this week there were lines for groceries, gas, even at drive thru ATMS that I haven't seen since the beginning of Covid in March. I'd like to have a country again where hunkering down scared is not a big part of life.
1323366366947254275 2020-11-03 04:48:23 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @kennbass I can't decide if I want rose or white. I'm definitely too nervous to handle red.
1323365445144092677 2020-11-03 04:44:43 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Treating dinner as sort of a last meal. I'm one of those people that when I hit a certain stress level I lose my appetite. I actually lost weight during quarantine. And depending on how tomorrow goes, I might not want food for a while. So today babaganoush, lamb, naan and wineüç∑
1323363608319897605 2020-11-03 04:37:25 +0800 <YourComicMuse> If you haven't seen the @sarahcpr Netflix special, today is a cathartic day to do so. Just watch this clip and you'll see why. Really brilliant.
1323361571465240581 2020-11-03 04:29:20 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Jesus Christ. If Spanish speakers aren't roundly insulted by this lazy, whitest abuse of their language I don't know what to say.
1323360125197996032 2020-11-03 04:23:35 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MikeReissWriter I'm happy for you guys, and happy Russian speakers will get to enjoy it now, but today, man, I don't want to look at this.
1323358518662123520 2020-11-03 04:17:12 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I don't think I can handle the election tomorrow AND "a hotdog is a sandwich" Twitter.
1323347822775848961 2020-11-03 03:34:42 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Work friend who doesn't follow politics but is honestly not a jerk (just a shy, odd, ultra nerd who doesn't own a TV, grew up in Canada, does crafts etc.) came to me "because she trusts my opinion" to help her fill out her ballot. I was so honored, AND THAT BALLOT IS BLUE BABY!
1323345256138612745 2020-11-03 03:24:30 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @RageMichelle I would 100% eat thoseüòõ
1323344806039474176 2020-11-03 03:22:42 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Listen to the one true Batman Pennsylvania! Thank you Michael Keaton for being a stand up guy‚ù§ #VoteThemOut
1323337664674844679 2020-11-03 02:54:20 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @Chinchillazllla I am probably the only person who has lived in Colorado without grow light advice;) But honestly, a Colorado pot shop is probably worth a call.
1323334247206297601 2020-11-03 02:40:45 +0800 <YourComicMuse> "Radicle." I am completely certain every Trump family member got into college the Lori Loughlin way.
1323330061580275714 2020-11-03 02:24:07 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Hearing a lot of "if we know anything in America, once something that cost anything is taken away it never comes back" talk about brick &amp; mortar businesses, govt agencies, even schools. I hope somehow we can fight this on the grounds it is unhealthy to just interact with screens.
1323328169026478080 2020-11-03 02:16:36 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @usedwigs Yes please
1323322924846166017 2020-11-03 01:55:46 +0800 <YourComicMuse> So many signs like this across the country. I can't tell anymore if they are closed permanently or still hoping to come back. I used to love these for hangover food in Virginia.  https://t.co/C67RwEAJdA
1323317714102947840 2020-11-03 01:35:03 +0800 <YourComicMuse> If you are an American this year, and especially this week and have been able to retain any carefree coolness or happy, laid back swagger sincerely, my hats off to you. Those used to be my thing. I hope they come back.
1323300816858554371 2020-11-03 00:27:55 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Jesus. Please vote them out.
1323288442051170304 2020-11-02 23:38:44 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I hope to live in a time again when I have important calls to make to family, businesses and the DMV and I don't have to think - "Are they going to be boarded up and closed because of election riots?" "Is it too much to call family with my personal problem during election week?"
1323087929548427267 2020-11-02 10:21:58 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @jasonroeder And I'm not even tired. I don't really feel like I did much. Because I'm used to being a flight attendant and working 2 or 3 flights in a day.
1323085618231070737 2020-11-02 10:12:47 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Tax the rich
1323084734520590336 2020-11-02 10:09:17 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @jasonroeder I flew from Denver to Washington D.C. today. My flight didn't even leave Denver until 11:30 am. I then took a train from D.C. to Fredericksburg, Virginia. I got to my hotel in Fredericksburg at 8:30 p.m. It's now 9 &amp; I'm exploring dinner options. Today is a week and counting.
1323063696566951936 2020-11-02 08:45:41 +0800 <YourComicMuse> And screamed at us to wear a mask and stay home without anyone knowing where to get a mask or how to stay home without making money. Merica'
1323060427908067332 2020-11-02 08:32:41 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @mattknudsen I hope you're right, but I'm scared.
1323058974711795717 2020-11-02 08:26:55 +0800 <YourComicMuse> This is great, but how on earth someone this intelligent couldn't decide between G.W. Bush and Gore  scares the hell out of me. I'm shook Mike, gotta be honest.
1323056537527558148 2020-11-02 08:17:14 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I still don't understand how in every place he's held a rally there are covid rules in place that they are not permitted. No concerts, church, or other gatherings are allowed. Mask and distancing ordinances are in place for all businesses. How is he allowed to continue?
1323052916299714560 2020-11-02 08:02:51 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @scullymike Thank god. Really didn't expect them to do the right thing.
1322962920674750464 2020-11-02 02:05:14 +0800 <YourComicMuse> All this from Lindsey Graham, a 65 year old life long bachelor who claims to have never been sexually active. He claims to have had one chaste engagement to a German flight attendant in the 80s. Though no one has ever been able to locate or identify this fiancee.
1322671954822922243 2020-11-01 06:49:02 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I'm sure if Biden wins these people are going to be totally cool and compliant. I feel completely safe once Trump is defeated they won't go nuts.
1322668847078559745 2020-11-01 06:36:41 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Marnie is my favorite Hitchcock for very personal reasons. Objectively I know it's not his best. The male role in particular requires too much suspension of disbelief. But Sean Connery adeptly pulled it off, a reoccuring skill of his, including all that Bond, James Bond business.  https://t.co/cdyuDk0w2i
1322660591417225216 2020-11-01 06:03:53 +0800 <YourComicMuse> In a smart, functioning Democratic party these two women would have authority voices over Nancy Pelosi. It wasn't that long ago that people under 75 were in power positions in our government. When are we going to let strong, current, sincere people who have it right lead again?
1322614083997196288 2020-11-01 02:59:05 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Nothing worse than people on TV being chipper about Halloween stay at home ideas. It sucks. As we enter the holiday season I think it would be more comforting for the Al Rokers of the world to throw in some "boy does this suck" commentary.
1322387877309767680 2020-10-31 12:00:13 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I know I work at a nice place, because a coworker can leave me chocolate covered macadamia nuts she got in Hawaii in my v-file for 2 weeks and no one steals them. I'm sure if I worked somewhere sleazy like The White House, The President of the United States would have eaten them.
1322347776777297921 2020-10-31 09:20:52 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MKupperman @brianschatz Lol. Thank you. Our insufferable Senators. Tweeting while we die.
1322334244715319296 2020-10-31 08:27:06 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Someday...
1322297248684781568 2020-10-31 06:00:05 +0800 <YourComicMuse> And Jon Stewart. We really lost a huge, historically important influence on politics with him.
1322285084133658624 2020-10-31 05:11:45 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @timheidecker I was wondering about Steven Spielberg
1322060633165062144 2020-10-30 14:19:52 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Julian Castro would have made such a great presidential candidate. God I'm nervous.
1322058374968614913 2020-10-30 14:10:53 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @Dave_Horwitz I honestly hope Mindy Kaling posts some picture of herself in a new sunhat in her yard or something.
1322046215706476544 2020-10-30 13:22:34 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @just_evolved If you consider the very pre-Tiger Woods country clubs and golf tournaments bubble environment Nicklaus spent most of his life in, I mean, come on.
1322045306322644992 2020-10-30 13:18:58 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @just_evolved Yeah, not surprising though.
1322043706447286272 2020-10-30 13:12:36 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @just_evolved It really kills me. So much music and some great movies I'll never quite enjoy anymore.
1322040009172557829 2020-10-30 12:57:55 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MtGayCreamSoda  https://t.co/dLA7iQvCrP
1322039724568051713 2020-10-30 12:56:47 +0800 <YourComicMuse> The only one that hurts or surprises me is Ice Cube. So fucking disappointing.
1322035851136675840 2020-10-30 12:41:23 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Hey, "on the plus side the masks will keep our faces warm this winter" Pollyannas why don't you STFU.
1322023376601313281 2020-10-30 11:51:49 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I'm in L.A. and saw the same thing. The first place I saw boarded up was the Benihana in Santa Monica. If any of you fuckers loot Benihana at least try to get me the recipe for their ginger salad dressing. The best salad dressing on earth.
1322022290855354368 2020-10-30 11:47:30 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Oh good. So now the Americans who already own 393 million guns (43% of all privately owned guns worldwide) and all the frightened Americans who are buying guns for the first time right now in all the gun stores will be the only ones with guns. Pheew.
1321997222947422208 2020-10-30 10:07:54 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @sadmonsters I have to be honest I would find a backlit Frank Lesser in flowing robes and Jesus sandals kind of comforting. Maybe make him moonwalk?
1321921209848659969 2020-10-30 05:05:51 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Just a reminder that Dave Hill got banned from Twitter for responding to MAGA Nazis in his mentions with silly I'm gonna fuck your mom jokes. So enjoy Twitter, this super cool website where all the MAGA Nazis still are.
1321914899895775232 2020-10-30 04:40:46 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I know I've said it a million times, but I so miss Dave Hill being on Twitter. He was my person. Fuck Jack Dorsey. Jesus, what an asshole.
1321914156514111488 2020-10-30 04:37:49 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I miss seeing old used condoms and blunts on the sidewalk when I walk around L.A. instead of old used masks and gloves.  https://t.co/S7xqrolAUy
1321898887888605185 2020-10-30 03:37:09 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Also, In Vegas for instance, it's $5 for a true 24 hours. Where in Denver if you buy a day pass for $10.50 it is only good until 2:59 a.m. no matter when you buy it. Really a rip off.
1321897666733727745 2020-10-30 03:32:18 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Hey @jaredpolis I love you, but I'm in L.A. and public transportation is free during covid. I was in Phoenix last week and so was their's. Why is it still the astronomical $10.50 a day in Denver? How is that feasible to most? It also thwarts green use.

1321888645289181184 2020-10-30 02:56:27 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Pretty much anyone else this would seem like a cheap publicity stunt or overly dramatic, ego driven "selflessness," but Paul Rudd just squeaks in there under the radar just like his acting career you know?
1321884620917415936 2020-10-30 02:40:27 +0800 <YourComicMuse> The most freeing thing lately is saying to people (including myself) an adolescent "I don't know." I was never even as a teen, an "I don't know" person. But it's the only true thing to say now without further damaging your psyche.
1321880207771357185 2020-10-30 02:22:55 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Wine/Beach/Sex I think this thing is rigged to make us feel better, but I'll take it.
1321870200250093573 2020-10-30 01:43:09 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Love that the big corporate American brand hotels are doing bullshit like this, even though I know enough hotel staff to know they aren't cleaning any differently than before the pandemic. This is such a great symbol of every American health policy.  https://t.co/E3fLVAAnYX
1321265648958349317 2020-10-28 09:40:53 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @LostCatDog The ones I know honestly believe there is voter fraud. That mail in ballots are being done by "illegals" multiple times. That everything in the news is fake. That the Democrats and media are in cahoots. These are people who otherwise act normal with jobs, mortgages and children:(
1321259374392860673 2020-10-28 09:15:57 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @mattknudsen You so fancy. You're ma fancy man.
1321246198800461824 2020-10-28 08:23:36 +0800 <YourComicMuse> All I have to comfort me this week is day drinking, direct warm sunlight, masturbation, Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune.  So, baseball can go straight to fucking hell for taking two of those away from me. Fuck your Dodgers, who cares.
1321236537443602433 2020-10-28 07:45:12 +0800 <YourComicMuse> And I still can't watch @janemarielynch after her "People with wine caves have as much rights as everyone else" tweet during Buttigieg's private Hollywood fundraisers. These people shouldn't have a say in jack shit, and need to cough up some taxes. #guillotinetime

1321216085564088322 2020-10-28 06:23:56 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @sadmonsters Thank you for posting this Frank. It has apparently become my lonely mission to inform people on here that covid is not a cleanly recovered from virus. AND ALSO, that it's not the chicken pox. Getting it doesn't make you immune, in fact it makes you more likely to get it again.
1321211889033031684 2020-10-28 06:07:15 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Happy Birthday @JohnCleeseüéÇ Comedy God of Gods. I once saw you getting into your chauffeured car after you dropped by a deli in East Kensington. I gawked blushing. You generously amused me by getting into your car backwards in silly Python fashion. A Top 10 moment of my life‚ù§
1321206120384520193 2020-10-28 05:44:20 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I love how she "asked everyone to quarantine." And I'm sure those outstanding descendants of a lawyer who tried his damndest to get O.J. off for murder complied.

1321204564821864448 2020-10-28 05:38:09 +0800 <YourComicMuse> After two weeks of multiple health screens and asking everyone to quarantine, I surprised my closest inner circle with a trip to a private island where we could pretend things were normal just for a brief moment in time.  https://t.co/ePJzGW2Ce6

1321152473629921281 2020-10-28 02:11:10 +0800 <YourComicMuse> So it looks like Denver is switching back to Level 3 after a covid spike. I support this of course, but it just feels like we're never going to get out of this. Please God let a vaccine come soon. Even if we get a vaccine, imagine how long it will take to really get out of this:(
1321143935847321601 2020-10-28 01:37:14 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Yes. And I was thinking one of those all ex presidents from both parties standing together endorsing Biden might do some good. A Hail Mary at this late point, but we're desperate for anything.
1320933570014285825 2020-10-27 11:41:19 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @brianbooone True
1320924245879365633 2020-10-27 11:04:16 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Democrats: Don't worry, they have swung the pendulum so far to the right it will have to swing back.  Republicans: What pendulum? What are they babbling about? Anyway, how soon can we start passing laws so poor people and minorities can't vote? Gerrymandering is too unreliable.
1320907192908787714 2020-10-27 09:56:30 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I don't know guys. I really don't know if I want to live out my days in a country where keeping my basic rights and criminals out of the government depends so heavily on what people in fucking Wisconsin do.
1320906142999027713 2020-10-27 09:52:20 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I already sobered up from a buzz day drinking during lunch. But this week I guess I might have to go back to college style drinking. Maybe some shots now to kill the pain of the evening news.
1320899904152240129 2020-10-27 09:27:32 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @PaymanBenz How about both.
1320887560680493063 2020-10-27 08:38:30 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Heartbroken, thinking about so much right now. Especially all my gay friends who have gotten married, have kids, homes, that have to worry and be afraid of Amy Covid Handmaid. That she has a fucking say in ruining their life. Fucking ridiculous. Fuck this country.

They sat in the plane at the gate over an hour in a snow storm. We had to cancel it. Not one snide comment as they deplaned. But a Trumper even mildly inconvenienced...whoa boy watch out.
1320875403616096258 2020-10-27 07:50:11 +0800 <YourComicMuse> TFW you get home and remember you forgot to take off your mask and are still wearing it a minute longer than you have to.
1320871203196727296 2020-10-27 07:33:30 +0800 <YourComicMuse> FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME. CORONAVIRUS IS NOT THE CHICKEN POX. JUST BECAUSE YOU GET IT ONCE DOES NOT MEAN YOU CAN'T GET IT AGAIN. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY. JESUS CHRIST.
1320820842209697793 2020-10-27 04:13:23 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Remake of Sex and the City: "The 5th lady isn't New York this time, it's a lady I like to call Covid 19 the Kween!" Charlotte gets Covid. Furious, guilty deathbed scene with Carrie via Zoom: "You smoke and didn't get it! I'm a runner!" Big smoking in background slinks off camera.
1320815920458203136 2020-10-27 03:53:49 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @nraymz We had an 85 year old couple here up in Grand Lake a few days ago who refused to evacuate. They said they couldn't start over and just stayed and died in their burning house. Good times.

1320764118714982402 2020-10-27 00:27:59 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I really found the old way of retweeting too simple - No one  We're going to fix retweeting by making it feel like you have to comment on the tweet to retweet - Twitter
1320549670314270721 2020-10-26 10:15:50 +0800 <YourComicMuse> For a long time I never cried. Like, Cameron Diaz in "The Holiday" level never cried. Now I cry. I really wish I cried now because Jude Law opened me up sexually in the British countryside, not because I'm a flight attendant during a pandemic with a criminal President.

1320428553025003520 2020-10-26 02:14:34 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Prediction: The next 9 days are going to feel like a cakewalk compared to the weeks after November 3rd. With all the mail in ballots that will still need to be counted, and crap Republicans are going to pull we won't have peace or a decision for a few weeks (at best.)
1320424563331747841 2020-10-26 01:58:42 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Anyone else besides me who has to work 8 to 10 hour days in a mask getting scabs on your undereye area?

1320239418754596864 2020-10-25 13:43:00 +0800 <YourComicMuse> The biggest giveaway with the fake Melanias to me is they don't look like they are constantly yearning for the sweet release of death.

1319411389803397121 2020-10-23 06:52:43 +0800 <YourComicMuse> This is voter suppression. It should not be reported as romanticized heroism.

1319370009618096138 2020-10-23 04:08:17 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Not to be a downer, but a main catchphrase I've seen on Trump 2020 shirts, hats, and yes, even masks is "Fuck your feelings." I also remember some of them in an airport mocking Obama because he was crying over another school shooting. They don't care about father/son affection.

1318674638784860164 2020-10-21 06:05:08 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Never forget how much dug in suburban Christian married couples and near death grandparents who lived their life as suburban Christian married couples want to die and take everyone else with them. The death cult of suburban monogamy is largely to blame for Trump.
1318658652878696448 2020-10-21 05:01:36 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Protip for my Fellow women: It's never the guys you think will pull out their dick that do. For instance- Wickham, way too smart and sexually active to just pull his dick out. Whereas Darcy's suppressed, uptight ass would eventually crack and pull his dick out.
1318652493018984448 2020-10-21 04:37:08 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @LostCatDog You did! Though I'm sure Christmas In Tampa would also be a great name for a coral OPI nail polish color:)

All I could find in the fridge was jalapeno juice, so I used that instead of olive juice and called my creation Godzilla's asshole.

It's so good I'd like to rename it something that is not a typically offensive American way of coopting and insulting another culture. Ideas?

1318289523361501184 2020-10-20 04:34:49 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Just a reminder that you never hear stories about women accidentally showing their pussy on zoom, or sending unsolicited pics of their pussy, or saying they just grab men by the dick because when you're a star they let you get away with it, etc. etc.
1318287986220441600 2020-10-20 04:28:43 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Today my favorite hot dog place said they no longer could offer relish because of covid?
1318268296777510912 2020-10-20 03:10:28 +0800 <YourComicMuse> This fawning HLN doc on JFK Jr.'s death is such BS: Jfk Jr. had his basic private pilot license, HE HAD NOT GOTTEN HIS INSTRUMENT RATING. Without an instrument rating you aren't qualified to fly at night in fog. His arrogance to fly in those conditions caused his crash. Period.
1318255939498045441 2020-10-20 02:21:22 +0800 <YourComicMuse> So scared about the election I can't even watch any news report that is  hopeful about our chances. 2016 PTSD runs deep.
1318083799742181379 2020-10-19 14:57:21 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Hey LAX- Making flight attendants get off the plane for security sweeps in the middle of redeye legs is unique to you, the most hated airport (next to La Guardia) by airline crews in America! L.A. loves to be special right? üñï
1318079421832593409 2020-10-19 14:39:57 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Really miss asking for a booth.
1318008804647292928 2020-10-19 09:59:21 +0800 <YourComicMuse> A cool thing about the New York Post story getting exposed as lies and Russian propaganda is all the Trump voters will still believe every word of it and worse. And no one is ever going to do anything to stop Russia from planting more stories and meddling in our elections.
1318000654808420352 2020-10-19 09:26:58 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Yes. And for the millionth time, Covid is not the chicken pox. Just because you get it once and survive it, doesn't mean you are immune and won't get it again. In fact reports are saying after it ravages your lungs you are MORE likely to get it again.
1317933284693868546 2020-10-19 04:59:15 +0800 <YourComicMuse> We'll just change it to "But HIS emails" and "Lock HIM up!" - Republican strategist completing his duties until 2024.

1317913153645113344 2020-10-19 03:39:16 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Lol. I like Helen Mirren, but she's a Hollywood actress who I'm sure spends most of her time in California when she's in the U.S. I have a feeling her Nevada residency has something to do with there being no state tax in Nevada. A very expat Brit move, usually seen in Europe.

1316885061057212416 2020-10-16 07:33:59 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I've never forgiven NBC for what they did to Letterman and especially to @ConanOBrien. I'm a Leo woman, beyond all the flash and shine we are ride or die loyal as fuck. #FuckNBC
1316880849095151616 2020-10-16 07:17:15 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Anyone else who has already early voted want to just hide under the bed with me for the next 3 months or so? We can just lay on our stomachs, drink beer and play Uno while the Civil War during a pandemic flames up around us.
1316849382608834562 2020-10-16 05:12:13 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Letterman definitely had his problems, but I am positive he wouldn't have cowered like @sethmeyers @jimmyfallon and from what I see all their writers and producers from expressing how wrong it is that NBC is giving Trump an hour of free airtime opposite Biden tonight.
1316621195777892352 2020-10-15 14:05:29 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @TotallyAllen Best kind.
1316559568751800320 2020-10-15 10:00:36 +0800 <YourComicMuse> So Hunter Biden had a drug problem? You mean the Hunter Biden whose brother died of cancer after going away to war? You mean the Hunter Biden who's been under the pressure of having a father who's been a public figure his whole life? Gee, I wonder why he'd have a drug problem?
1316479292147146753 2020-10-15 04:41:36 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @mrtimlong I just had to express the sadness I felt when my finger pressed to fav the Chinese food Sade tweet and it said "sorry that tweet has been deleted." Your whimsical instincts are always pure and appreciated in this environment:)

1316460415086460929 2020-10-15 03:26:36 +0800 <YourComicMuse> We all agree that in a somewhat fair world a can of soda should never cost more than 85 cents max, no matter where the vending machine, bodega, kiosk or store you buy it from is located right?
1316445348072652801 2020-10-15 02:26:44 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @chrislhayes @LPDonovan Any comment on your bosses giving Trump free airtime for a town hall airing opposite Biden's after Trump refused a debate?

1316205385909448705 2020-10-14 10:33:12 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Conchata Ferrell legitimized a mind boggling number of terrible to middling actors' performances.

1316088016633380864 2020-10-14 02:46:49 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Amy Covid Handmaid talking in this hearing is just listening to any Republican trying to be friends with you by saying their "I love talking to people who disagree with me" and "isn't it good to have different opinions" b.s. with that crazed, lonely look in their eye.
1316050544725647361 2020-10-14 00:17:55 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I watched Biden's whole speech yesterday, and his fragile presence was terrifying. You absolutely must vote for him, it is our only hope and option now. But I will never forgive the DNC for making sure he's the nominee in this desperate situation where everything is on the line.
1316049194122014720 2020-10-14 00:12:33 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MKupperman I appreciate you saying this though. It helps to talk about it. This has been the worst year for everyone I know in my adult life. Things were bad during the Bush recession, but this psychological, mental onslaught makes the economic, political anger back then seem manageable.
1315765425196732424 2020-10-13 05:24:57 +0800 <YourComicMuse> lmao. The sad thing is this sounds like oh-all-in-a-day for 2020.
1315733549337792515 2020-10-13 03:18:17 +0800 <YourComicMuse> And now Amy Covid Handmaid will be confirmed. Every day darker than the last.

1315431500217823232 2020-10-12 07:18:03 +0800 <YourComicMuse> We never talk about on here: How many scary people are in our midst everyday since Trump. Everyone is so afraid to speak out against him or vocalize what's going on for fear of Trump supporters at work, or in their neighborhood or social settings. This is how fascism flourishes.
1315422930294120448 2020-10-12 06:44:00 +0800 <YourComicMuse> As always I will fuck for foreign citizenship. I give really good head, especially if it's a fat, good looking cock attached to a nice British or French man. #Election2020
1315419165440827392 2020-10-12 06:29:03 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Seriously, if Trump is re-elected how do we poor and working class folks get the hell out of here? Do we form a migrant caravan to Canada and pray for mercy?
1315416976563613696 2020-10-12 06:20:21 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @thatbilloakley @ass_dentata You are a classy motherfucker mister.
1315411367910834183 2020-10-12 05:58:03 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Also Ruby Tuesday's going bankrupt  really sucks. I remember in the 80s when they allowed smoking, my mom smoking and crying in a booth while arguing with my Dad as their marriage fell apart. More recently we flight attendants for $12 could get a steak &amp; the salad bar to go.#RIP
1315407760012521474 2020-10-12 05:43:43 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Does anyone want to share a socially distanced, curbside pickup Applebee's 2 for $22 with me? That's 2 steaks or ribs with 2 sides each and a nice appetizer. We can just eat it right on the curb I really don't give a shit anymore, and I don't think they do either.
1315393443154268165 2020-10-12 04:46:50 +0800 <YourComicMuse> As we all continue to survive this hopefully cyclonic end of living under the abuse of Trump, I'm a lot more appreciative of how Tennessee Williams' rendered Blanche DuBois' need to be treated gently.
1315131394671161345 2020-10-11 11:25:33 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Really depressing talk with some flight attendants tonight about how with zoom, people working from home and people moving out of the big cities, business travel will probably never return to precovid levels of traffic.

1315011318978621442 2020-10-11 03:28:24 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Seriously, when are the Democrats ever going to step up and invoke the Hatch Act? This is illegal. Do your job @SpeakerPelosi.
1315007434549866498 2020-10-11 03:12:58 +0800 <YourComicMuse> So...they obviously were told and provided with what to wear. Did the American taxpayer pay for the Authoritarian prop costumes as well as the illegal White House use?
1314996563249430531 2020-10-11 02:29:46 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I can't believe we traded a paradise where someone had to write you a letter or try to get you on the phone at home, for a hell world where people can call, text and email you anytime and they know you got the message. And the people who think this is preferable are the problem.

1314746672954695680 2020-10-10 09:56:48 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @robertdsheridan I thought the same thing. He is doing his damndest to make Canada foreign, weird and other. This isn't unrealistic when you see how effectively the turned antifacsists "Antifa" into the pronounciation "An Tea Fa." Completely eliminating the word fascism from the movement.
1314723324187103232 2020-10-10 08:24:01 +0800 <YourComicMuse> So the Trump "medical exam" so far is Trump talking from the White House to the Fox News "doctor" who is asking him softball, fawning questions from the Fox Headquarters "news room."
1314721711045173249 2020-10-10 08:17:36 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @glazerboohoohoo Did I miss the "exam?"
1314721492870017024 2020-10-10 08:16:44 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I agree but would argue bottled ranch that has somehow become acceptable even in restaurants. Homemade ranch is cheap, easy and delicious. Yet all these restaurants and households serve bottled ranch that tastes disgusting, because Americans are lazy, tasteless hogs.
1314719695325532160 2020-10-10 08:09:36 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I am watching Tucker Carlson to live tweet and laugh at Trump's "medical exam." But I might die from watching this show beforehand. Beyond all the lies, spin, bigotry and baseless fearmongering Tucker just pronounced Ottawa "Oh Tow A."

1314716456983105537 2020-10-10 07:56:44 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Scary thought from someone old enough to remember when the tea party formed and started all this insanity:  What if they find someone even more extreme and destructive to follow after Trump?

1314336123292876802 2020-10-09 06:45:25 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @robertrea Take away the 8th grade sentiment, and Imagine is a clunky, poorly written, poorly composed, barely performed amateur outing that no one else could have gotten pressed into a record.

1314329268587986945 2020-10-09 06:18:11 +0800 <YourComicMuse> If you are running out of things to drink during the pandemic and just sick of everything: Rum and Midori (I know but trust me) mixed with just about anything is mellow and cheerful all at the same time.
1314327758982578176 2020-10-09 06:12:11 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I do have to say the only thing I like about the pandemic is getting to close the door to an elevator with just me in it, and as a plus often having a group of Trumpy looking people mad at me for not breaking the one per ride rule for them.
1314321539991506944 2020-10-09 05:47:28 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @Prof_Hinkley 2000
1314057454255321089 2020-10-08 12:18:05 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @mattknudsen I think if his pink eye fell out of his face, rolled on the table and then the fly landed on it, and then someone swatted the fly and squished the eyeball in the process it would have been funnier. I mean, if we are going with corny, over the top let's go for it.
1314054091924963328 2020-10-08 12:04:44 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I know the election's gonna be fine, because 8,000 people tweeted the same flies are attracted to shit joke tonight thinking it was an original humdinger, and those are the people on here every minute of every day saying we're going to win. They also did the same thing in 2016.
1314048177151115267 2020-10-08 11:41:13 +0800 <YourComicMuse> At least I haven't heard anyone on MSNBC say "Joementum." With MSNBC, it's the little things. And I mean, really, really little things.
1314046197099835399 2020-10-08 11:33:21 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @sadmonsters I've been tired of whatever hell lord is writing this corny, excruciating, nightmare for 4 years. I like to think if there is a heaven, even if a true artist is a filthy sinning hedonist, they get in because talent is more important. America is now Salieiri's opera, not Mozart's.
1314041663506055173 2020-10-08 11:15:20 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Ah, MSNBC with James Carville analyzing the debate just like in 2016. Sure why not?
1314025955984322561 2020-10-08 10:12:55 +0800 <YourComicMuse> The saddest part of this is it's obvious though Pence is evil and Kamala isn't ideal that they are 500% more competent, mentally acute and prepared to run for President than Trump and Biden n'est ce pas? #Debates2020
1314024425893888002 2020-10-08 10:06:51 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Exactly. Grow the fuck up you guys. He's not Trump. He has prepared every lie meticulously.
1314023418317209600 2020-10-08 10:02:50 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Yep. A terrifying number of people. He sells FOX NEWS lies better than anyone the Murdochs have ever hired. He makes Mitch McConnell look amateur. Shameless, ice cold psycho.
1314020874215993347 2020-10-08 09:52:44 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Lol. THANK YOU‚ù§ PLEASE TURN 35 LIKE RIGHT NOW. THIS IS SO DEPRESSING TO WATCH.
1314020494316797954 2020-10-08 09:51:13 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Would love someday to have a liberal candidate who doesn't shake all over and deny it when they're called a liberal, but hey that's just me. #Debates2020
1314018679101755392 2020-10-08 09:44:01 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I don't know if I'm up for more enthusiastic support of fracking from both sides of this debate. I'm hungry and might go get food. Don't worry, "moderate Dems" aka Republicans, I'll still vote for her ass. You and the DNC fixed it real good in the "primary" so I have no choice‚úå
1314017244989452288 2020-10-08 09:38:19 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Ahhh...the part where my Democrat candidate proudly promises she will not ban fracking and defiantly shake her head that she doesn't support the green new deal while the state she represents is continually on fire.  Ok. Sorry. I'll shut my Bernie AOC ass up, I know my place.
1314015670669963266 2020-10-08 09:32:03 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Kamala stop looking at Pence when you answer. Just look straight ahead and connect with America. Don't even include him in your time to do this. That's Bill Clinton, Obama, Reagan debate shit 101.
1314013934475767815 2020-10-08 09:25:09 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Every ad I saw about this debate said there would be fact checking. I really had hoped somehow it would be running concurrent on the screen while Pence calmly lies his ass off. #Debates2020
1314013071569022976 2020-10-08 09:21:44 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Why is he allowed to talk this long? Kamala better get equal time.
1314012281848705028 2020-10-08 09:18:35 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @bader_diedrich Exactly. So much more dangerous than Trump. Mitch McConnell style ice man.
1314011812128600066 2020-10-08 09:16:43 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @WendyLiebman Yep. Pence is a stone cold bastard. Who knows how to sell the lies. Terrifying.
1314011175085125632 2020-10-08 09:14:11 +0800 <YourComicMuse> See, this is why I said when everyone wanted Trump to die of covid that Pence is so much more dangerous than Trump. He knows how to appear sane, articulate, loving and how to sell bullshit. He is a stone cold, ice man bastard on the level of Mitch McConnell. #Debates2020
1314010146587193348 2020-10-08 09:10:06 +0800 <YourComicMuse> At least the mayonnaise jar isn't interrupting like the sweaty cheeto. #Debates2020
1314009342958592001 2020-10-08 09:06:55 +0800 <YourComicMuse> First thought: God, I wish Kamala was the candidate instead of Biden. Got to let that go at some point.#Debates2020
1314008584791916548 2020-10-08 09:03:54 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @Eden_Eats Vodka shots. Believe me, I wish I could take narcotics or edibles, but I have a job where I'm constantly drug tested:(
1314006310422286337 2020-10-08 08:54:52 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I can't believe we're at the phase of this overwrought, corny, hellish movie we're trapped in that the Republican villains might actually give a deadly virus to the Democrats just by standing on a stage debating them.
1314004003794096130 2020-10-08 08:45:42 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Idea For Us All: Be a contestant on Wheel of Fortune and come up with the filthiest and dumbest wrong solves possible. The trick would be being so convincing the show would air. You'd have to throw in a couple of real solves. The acting performance of the century awaits someone.
1313990761894076417 2020-10-08 07:53:05 +0800 <YourComicMuse> The only good thing about Ken Bone is he's a blue check mark. I just want all the other blue check marks to think about that, when they get all huffy about us unwashed unverifieds existing on here.
1313979461621239808 2020-10-08 07:08:10 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Ugh. Yep.
1313976013815242754 2020-10-08 06:54:28 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Credible people have talked about Regeneron helping with covid, but we are now in a situation where if the President of the United States says something it's usually a lie. If he is re-elected there will be continued chaos in getting people to trust a vaccine if one is found.
1313922298982924288 2020-10-08 03:21:02 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I appreciate this sentiment, but I think you'll be lonely. Just as Stephen Colbert does sketches with Henry Kissinger, they'll slowly gain acceptance again with those people. It will start with weddings and charity events and trickle on to parties. Industry people never change.
1313916379326746624 2020-10-08 02:57:30 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @PFTompkins You're a dandy. You should hire him to warm up your crowds by wearing some of your suits.
1313913714173673473 2020-10-08 02:46:55 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Ken Bone saying he's undecided every four years is like when blue checks say they're quitting Twitter.
1313907424814944257 2020-10-08 02:21:55 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @KimmyMonte Hell yes.
1313896989180997634 2020-10-08 01:40:27 +0800 <YourComicMuse> ROIDS MAN. ROIDS. (And God knows what else.)
1313890748358635522 2020-10-08 01:15:39 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MarylandMudflap My friend Suzanne Witherington and I did this when we were 15 to the mean boy in the neighborhood when he got a brand new jeep for his 16th birthday. Never got caught.
1313882587283296257 2020-10-08 00:43:14 +0800 <YourComicMuse> The biggest secret I keep every day of my life is trying to be alone. No one seems to understand. They think I'm shy or busy or don't know what a great time I'd have if I just did something with them. Why are so many people like that? So many.
1313580488565510145 2020-10-07 04:42:48 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Another thing that sucks about the likes of Eddie Van Halen and Neil Peart dying off is they won't be replaced. Call it classic rock all you want, but that was when you had to be able to fucking PLAY. Those motherfuckers shredded and destroyed on a level that doesn't exist now.
1313575210625363968 2020-10-07 04:21:49 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I can't think of many other pop/rock musicians who inspired such awe when they played their instrument as Eddie Van Halen. It was on the level of Jerry Lee Lewis playing piano, or Michael Jackson's first moonwalk. He defined the highest standard of guitar in the 80s.
1313329765441568769 2020-10-06 12:06:31 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Oh boy. Shark jumped. I mean, definitely vote for all Democrats in all states, but shark jumped.
1313328623504457729 2020-10-06 12:01:58 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @DunkingBaby The weird thing is I'm starting to listen to these people. No joke, I run into at least one person a day that delivers a monologue like this that, quite frankly, doesn't at all match what you would see normally coming out of that person's mouth.
1313326541783302144 2020-10-06 11:53:42 +0800 <YourComicMuse> TO BEFORE. It just seems like everyone is going mad. But it's becoming more and more prevalent the longer the pandemic goes on. I really was not prepared for all the nuevo dark ages shit.
1313326127386161154 2020-10-06 11:52:03 +0800 <YourComicMuse> summoning people and situations psychically that we have unresolved issues with.

1313325166806564864 2020-10-06 11:48:14 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Is anyone else having stuff like this happen a lot: Customer service lady by our crew check in asked how I'm doing. I said "Have you ever had one of those days you run into everyone you don't want to?" She answered (I'm not kidding) "We are going through a purge. We are all (1/?)
1313323653841461249 2020-10-06 11:42:14 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Saw a guy in the airport tonight wearing a Ramones mask, and I just really feel done. Like that might have been my Nietzsche horse moment.
1313313373812068352 2020-10-06 11:01:23 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MikeReissWriter I can't help but feel her diagnosis was a fabrication lumped in with his, so she could avoid the fallout of her "Fuck Christmas" tapes. And it worked.

And of course you've got Peter Sellers, Dudley Moore, Julie, his usual cast of secondary actors he'd reuse.

1313151213542748161 2020-10-06 00:17:01 +0800 <YourComicMuse> As you all know I love Fleetwood Mac. And though I get frustrated with her for kicking Lindsey Buckingham out of the band, I adore Stevie Nicks. Over the years on Twitter I've had men mainly shit all over her. So, I'm really enjoying all the men showing her love in these videos.
1312866760744468481 2020-10-05 05:26:42 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I thought the Spin Doctors were a terrible band from the 90s.
1312615964756803590 2020-10-04 12:50:07 +0800 <YourComicMuse> But why pretend Republicans will care? Why still pretend they are interested in fairness? They will not vote for a black Democrat, even if the Republican candidate murders someone on live television. They. Don't. Care.
1312611706565132288 2020-10-04 12:33:12 +0800 <YourComicMuse> This picture reminds me of when my  grandfather was in the final stages of Alzheimers and the nurses would give him a phone that wasn't plugged in and a notepad, and sit him at a desk. It would calm him into thinking he was at his old job. He liked getting dressed in a suit too.
1312608506390802434 2020-10-04 12:20:29 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Chloe Fineman did a very good job of making fun of Drew Barrymore and her unbelievably terrible show. Though I feel it should have been based on a series of tweets between me and several of you. My nauseating L.A. chick mom off between Drew &amp; Busy Phillips would have been better.
1312605175211646977 2020-10-04 12:07:15 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Ugh. God awful cold open with weak impressions by both Alec Baldwin and Jim Carrey. Awful Chris Rock monologue. Pete Davidson breaking. Those 2 twerps in the dead on arrival "Mike Litt" sketch. So many talented comedians and writers out there you could employ Lorne. #SNLPremiere
1312585075834249220 2020-10-04 10:47:23 +0800 <YourComicMuse> If Prince was alive he'd definitely make some rad, nasty song high out of his mind quarantining in his Paisley Park studio called "Super Spreader."
1312544752374624256 2020-10-04 08:07:09 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Is Trump just wearing a white flag pin now? Is that for white supremacy? If only it would mean he surrenders.  https://t.co/6aU7gQlNC3

1312141776585515011 2020-10-03 05:25:52 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @JayKogen Why do controlling people try to control people who have no interest in controlling anybody?
1312116400907939840 2020-10-03 03:45:02 +0800 <YourComicMuse> So much of survival in this life is just sitting still, being pleasant and mainly quiet, and looking clean and presentable isn't it? At least for us poors.
1312067173792260101 2020-10-03 00:29:25 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I know most people on Twitter don't care, but if there are airline employees on here-  in my 20 years on the job this is the darkest day I've seen other than 9/11. I still have my job because of my seniority, but I'm angry, broken, and gutted for the thousands furloughed today.

1312063370791735300 2020-10-03 00:14:19 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I really don't know why any Canadians visit America or even speak to Americans anymore. I'm sorry Canada. Stay away from us we're a toxic shithole.
1312059580751503360 2020-10-02 23:59:15 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @VoLinxx Yes. Many.
1312044630716809217 2020-10-02 22:59:51 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Ok. I don't want Biden to have covid, but if Trump &amp; Biden both have it &amp; can't run...do we get Pence vs. Kamala?? My preference would of course be a revolution overtaking the government &amp; writing a new constitution where we no longer have a POTUS or parties, but that's just me‚úå
1312040354934259714 2020-10-02 22:42:51 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I am SUPER irritated that the covid diagnosis means Melania is getting off the hook for these tapes though.
1311784487051685888 2020-10-02 05:46:08 +0800 <YourComicMuse> So the guy promised me the social workers are not cops, that she would not be arrested or incarcerated. He said he was calling them and that they were good people. I guess I have to trust that. I have to be up at 3 a.m. for my flight tomorrow, so I'm back at the hotel:(
1311777969547878400 2020-10-02 05:20:14 +0800 <YourComicMuse> She said she has neurological problems after a car accident. She said shelters are limited during covid, so she sleeps outside. She says she has a sister who's also homeless here. A man who also gave her money told me they have social workers here he could call. I don't know:(
1311773205607059456 2020-10-02 05:01:18 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Layover in SLC. I'm about to go give this homeless girl money. But I just also feel like I should talk to her. She's so young. Other than is there a shelter you can stay at, what should I ask that could be helpful?  https://t.co/0xzGYxouF5
1311752886842523648 2020-10-02 03:40:34 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I dreamed all night last night I was explaining to people "You can get Covid more than once. It is not the chicken pox. Getting it once does not mean you're immune." I mean, solid REM sleep all night, but I sure wish we got credible updates on any vaccine or treatment progress.
1311750447900831744 2020-10-02 03:30:52 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Yes. This is why I think it is important, as unpleasant as it is, for more TV shows and movies to portray WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW IN REAL TIME. It's like unless people see goose stepping Nazis in SS uniforms on the street like they've seen in movies, it's not fascism.
1311749005479759874 2020-10-02 03:25:08 +0800 <YourComicMuse> This seems more like an I'm sorry I've lost so much money and opportunities being a Trump supporter than a true rebuke of Trump because of his white supremacy. It is a way out to try and salvage his career and wealth. I would bet he votes Trump alone in that voting booth.

1311741046381064192 2020-10-02 02:53:31 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I'm sorry, I think this is going to be really good. Especially with Sacha Baron Cohen's seasoned, articulate confidence now critiquing public figures and America in general.
1311731774297264128 2020-10-02 02:16:40 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @jilltwiss Yes. And bobby pins (I'm a bun gal.)
1311698277146914818 2020-10-02 00:03:34 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I grew up in Memphis, TN. Rhodes College is a small, lackluster, private college for rich kids who couldn't even get into Sewanee.
1311694328658497537 2020-10-01 23:47:52 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Honestly, just imagine if this was a Democrat first lady.
1311681673457618944 2020-10-01 22:57:35 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Really enjoyed this last night. It takes place right now- masks, covid, quarantining, out of control police fascism, Trump &amp; everything else. The only show that has. It was cathartic, and has some of the funniest moments of the series. Enjoy it here free before it goes to HBOMAX.

1311062364696043520 2020-09-30 05:56:40 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @sadmonsters I have to work and I'm honestly glad.
1310741606845169665 2020-09-29 08:42:06 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @TotallyAllen Yep.
1310736506282106880 2020-09-29 08:21:50 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Everyone shocked in America that Johnny Rotten is no longer punk rock, and has aged into a Trump supporter: When I lived in England 10 years ago he was doing commercials for tubs of margarine. So, I don't think anyone in the UK has expected anarchy from him in a long time.
1310346762062880768 2020-09-28 06:33:07 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Worked with a fellow Democrat today, but the older kind that thinks the Lincoln Project is crushing it and thinks Pelosi is a badass. And now I'm scared all over again for the election:(
1310030096472985601 2020-09-27 09:34:48 +0800 <YourComicMuse> "A sincere apology from your college boyfriend." Lmao. Wow, I can't even imagine such a thing. Great show @ambermruffin ‚ù§
1310024772605022209 2020-09-27 09:13:39 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Twitter, I know there's a lot going on right now, but "breathe" has an e on the end of it. As in "I can't breathe." "Breath" is the spelling for "He has bad breath" or "take a breath." Also please vote for Biden, so maybe we can get education funding for America's schools. Geez.
1310010449123893248 2020-09-27 08:16:44 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Imagine meeting a man who is against any form of birth control. That man is a fucking weirdo at best.

1309859131134623745 2020-09-26 22:15:27 +0800 <YourComicMuse> If you talk to someone who says the coronavirus will "magically disappear on November 4th," be sure to tell them that voting day is November 4th not November 3rd.

And the 1st Jewish person? And as of 2019 only 2 black people? America is a white man's country. Always has been. I don't see that changing in any real way soon.

You can insist a man wear a mask, only do it from behind, show you a negative covid test first, and sing an operatic aria the whole time and he's like üé∂O mio babbino caro...üé∂

1308929187038859270 2020-09-24 08:40:11 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I saw a man flirt with a woman today by complimenting her sparkly, beaded mask. He gushed and said it "suited her." She blushed and talked about where she bought it. I hate that this is where we seem to be permanently headed till it kills us all I guess.

That just a few bad, unlucky things couldn't put them over the edge mentally or on the street.

One of the worst tropes in this cruel country is homeless people just lack motivation. That life is some Hollywood movie where if you got them a shave and a suit they could run a corporation. That mental illness isn't real.
1306337528182579200 2020-09-17 05:01:51 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @juliussharpe Sorry Julius. Just wanted to tell you I know several suburban families who watched &amp; like the show. These are the kind of families who only seemed to watch AGT and other reality competition shows. Hadn't heard them mention a sitcom in a LONG time. I thought it would get renewed.
1306331176743780352 2020-09-17 04:36:37 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MrChuckMartin It hurts your ears so much. Worse than front row at a Metallica concert ever could.

1305919778985394176 2020-09-16 01:21:52 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Hey pearl clutching blue checks- Jon Stewart caught Jim Cramer on a hot mic admitting to continually starting false rumors to affect stock prices during the Bush recession. Stewart confronted him on air, and Kramer couldn't deny it. That's when he should have been fired.

1305340863258779649 2020-09-14 11:01:28 +0800 <YourComicMuse> A polite, loving question- If we do win the election and defeat Trump, can some of the relentlessly self righteous people who only tweet about politics and have pearl clutching outrage every minute on here maybe take a little Twitter break? We appreciate your support, but please?
1305339687784132608 2020-09-14 10:56:48 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @heykarlin But where do they get off acting like anyone has ever needed tons of extra napkins to eat a quarter pounder? You can probably eat one with no napkins.
1305329523190358016 2020-09-14 10:16:24 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Yes. For you youngsters who have no idea what a timeless duet is by two actual adults who can SING that is about actual adult relationships, take a listen, enjoy and learn. #verzuz
1305326256674799616 2020-09-14 10:03:26 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Yesss!! "But something in my heart always knew I'd be lying here beside you...on my own." Probably my 2nd favorite duet of all time.

We all studied under Stan Brakhage who repeatedly said how important it was for all of us "to be honest and vocal about what we hate." He was talking about art and film, but he hated when

I said hey, I work for a living. So I loaned her the money...now she says she can't pay me back for a while...so I'm having her move my bar bells up to the attic..."
1302648585872388096 2020-09-07 00:43:19 +0800 <YourComicMuse> My current jumpseat read. Really keeping my spirits up @tompapa. Sorry I got this one from the library and didn't buy it. But I've bought most of them!üòã  https://t.co/2Cj7AvJ021
1302613551740116992 2020-09-06 22:24:06 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Put my hair up in a bun for work in an airport bathroom while wearing my mask. Accidentally combed the mask ear loops under strands of hair, so now my mask stays on whether the loops are around my ears or not. I think I might do this on purpose now. Thanks for following!
1302430173720002562 2020-09-06 10:15:26 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @scullymike As a woman, I'm very sure he doesn't have them yell "play."
1302427844643926018 2020-09-06 10:06:10 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @mattknudsen I'm in the mid 8000s too. It is a shitty, sad, mildly embarrassing place to be if you care. But the good news is I honestly don't anymore.
1302423979236311040 2020-09-06 09:50:49 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @Benjaminknorr79 You need to be able to clearly remember the 90s to appreciate it.
1302423635437608960 2020-09-06 09:49:27 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @Benjaminknorr79 Then yes.
1302423412543860736 2020-09-06 09:48:34 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @Benjaminknorr79 How old are you?
1302416139704647680 2020-09-06 09:19:40 +0800 <YourComicMuse> And the little children's card table Trump makes him sit behind. I just can't...oh my god.
1302411554327937025 2020-09-06 09:01:26 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @usedwigs Little Stint and Snipe are OGs. ChiffChaff is new to the game, but is breaking new ground and holding his own. Twite is just frontin' trying to hide is lack of skills behind them. Twite's gotta go.
1302377351460790272 2020-09-06 06:45:32 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Lol. Still so great. I was just thinking about this the other day.
1302366050449674240 2020-09-06 06:00:37 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @thatbilloakley @tomgara @darth Someday I'd love to talk to you about the perplexing disparity between McDonald's wrongly cancelled orange drink (best fast food drink ever) McDonald's Sprite (Magic. Best fountain Sprite) &amp; McDonald's Coke (aftertaste of roast beef marinated in dishwater in a Hefty garbage bag?)

1302333091847962624 2020-09-06 03:49:39 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Shout out to everyone who still finds this their mask of choice. Fabric ones are too cumbersome. Tie around the head ones, while saving the ears, fall down.  https://t.co/Vf1pTozUAr
1302321091948371968 2020-09-06 03:01:58 +0800 <YourComicMuse> McDonald's now wrongly cancelled orange drink: Sheer heaven. Best fast food drink ever. McDonald's sprite: Magic. How do they make the best fountain Sprite? McDonald's Coke: Do they infuse this with moldy roast beef that's been sauteed in dirty dish water in a Hefty garbage bag?
1302316061925060608 2020-09-06 02:41:59 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I live in Colorado. I desperately want Cory Gardner to lose. But John Hickenlooper is running an abysmal campaign, and Cory Gardner is a master politician and candidate. He knows exactly what to do in ads. He will win. It's awful.
1302314454072217600 2020-09-06 02:35:36 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @IanKarmel Oof. Not much. Maybe Julian Lennon or Jakob Dylan, but I'm reachin'.

1302081847397167105 2020-09-05 11:11:18 +0800 <YourComicMuse> To all the people on here hanging on by a thread- who are terrified about losing their jobs, their homes, so many things now, who have that one straw in their mind where they would end it all, you aren't alone. Reach out. There are always other options. #SuicidePreventionMonth
1302061096254271488 2020-09-05 09:48:51 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @timcarvell @ashleyn1cole I honestly have tweeted several times about Paul Giamatti's role as hotel employee who lets Julia Roberts smoke in a hotel hallway to no response of course. I validate you. I feel less alone now, thank you.

1302000337470001155 2020-09-05 05:47:25 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Not hot, not feigning shock take  from me, who just wants us to win: This Trump disparaging veterans tack is MUCH smarter and more effective to run with before the election than the "masks should be federally enforced" ad. I'm not saying masks shouldn't be, but I want to win.
1301986177772208130 2020-09-05 04:51:09 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Fellow nerd comedy fans help: I am racking my brain trying to remember this stand up comedian who does a very funny bit about how pancakes sound great until you take two bites and want to die. He's a white male (I know that really helps huh?) Can anyone name who he is?
1301932146626494465 2020-09-05 01:16:27 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Taking a break from politicians, I am starting a list of the most terrifying, brazenly dishonest people I have encountered in my adult life. Feel free to add your own: 1. Real Estate Agents (and everyone else is a distant second BTW) 2. Antique appraisers 3. Lawyers of course
1301648484790018048 2020-09-04 06:29:16 +0800 <YourComicMuse> It is September 3, 2020. So, may I be apparently not even nearly the first to wish you a very merry Christmas.  https://t.co/ytf3P810XX
1301608452830056448 2020-09-04 03:50:12 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @schlife I'm happy for you sweetie. It's been entertaining;)
1301598619464691712 2020-09-04 03:11:08 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Still one of the best lay in the sun and melt away stress songs. If you are stressed, and I know you are, take a few minutes to lay in the sun and listen. Definitely beats any meditation app anyway.  https://t.co/3XsZ7dXhDR
1301593294464413696 2020-09-04 02:49:58 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Shout out to all my fellow essential workers who have been forced back to work for months, or never quit working. Can you imagine if any of our coworkers who have tested positive and their workplaces were treated with this much caution and respect?
1301286858698174464 2020-09-03 06:32:18 +0800 <YourComicMuse> "He looks pretty uh...down lol."- Len, ""Steal My Sunshine" 199- whatever. Still the biggest own in music history.

1301235688814211072 2020-09-03 03:08:58 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MtGayCreamSoda And at what fucking point in all this if you are a middle aged adult do you just say life is too fucking short?
1301235400443219973 2020-09-03 03:07:49 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MtGayCreamSoda Yep. Prettiest I've ever seen.
1301234952239894528 2020-09-03 03:06:03 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MtGayCreamSoda I mean it's pretty commercial now, but it would do as a base down there.
1301234318899961857 2020-09-03 03:03:32 +0800 <YourComicMuse> @MtGayCreamSoda Ever been to the Bequia islands, or the Winward islands or say, Martinique?
1301233497005199360 2020-09-03 03:00:16 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Not all heroes sell tasteful, quality made, or even ethically made clothing. In this hellish time, I'll take it.
1301232221076946944 2020-09-03 02:55:11 +0800 <YourComicMuse> By a million percent.

1301224612567474177 2020-09-03 02:24:57 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I know I'm a miserable American, because for escape I watched that horrible Anne Heche/Harrison Ford stranded on a desert island movie in its entirety. I couldn't do a desert island, but if things stay like this I might show up in say, French Bequia, with just a toothbrush.
1301209789867982848 2020-09-03 01:26:03 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Thank you Josh for joining my battle against the frightening number of people on Twitter who use an apostrophe s to make words plural. Yes, there are more frightening things going on, like Adam Corolla's dumb, reckless tweet, but can't we have an apocalypse with decent grammar?
1301194378866614272 2020-09-03 00:24:49 +0800 <YourComicMuse> Maybe the best Between Two Ferns moment.

1300987041895731201 2020-09-02 10:40:56 +0800 <YourComicMuse> I know it's small, but it would help the anxiety we're in for posters like this to just call us people. Calling us "individuals" like we're already suspects in a crime feels even more tense. I'd also like to extend this to people who've normalized calling all cars "vehicles."  https://t.co/tdg7Ksf0MI
