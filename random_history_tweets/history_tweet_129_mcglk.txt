1343735646175678464 2020-12-29 09:48:38 +0800 <mcglk> @AZGOP Really, y'all are becoming poster children for both mental illness and unrequited love. I just feel so sorry for you.
1343298059749347328 2020-12-28 04:49:49 +0800 <mcglk> @GlassSpiider I blocked her long enough ago that I've forgotten when. There's only so much dedicated agnorance I can take.
1343288721450266624 2020-12-28 04:12:42 +0800 <mcglk> @JaimeLThorne Oh, so blockable.
1343279419037630466 2020-12-28 03:35:45 +0800 <mcglk> @GlassSpiider What'd she do this time?
1342922261041303553 2020-12-27 03:56:31 +0800 <mcglk> @googlefi I was already following you. Have been for quite a while, in fact.
1342910614847410176 2020-12-27 03:10:15 +0800 <mcglk> @jeffjarvis That is insanely cool, and I am very, very jealous.
1342910211506356224 2020-12-27 03:08:39 +0800 <mcglk> I've been a Google Fi enthusiast for a few years now—gotten other people to sign up, even—but if this is how their service is going forward . . . wow. Peak 2020, maybe, but it's incredibly disappointing.
1342909827740094464 2020-12-27 03:07:07 +0800 <mcglk> What's been the most dismaying is the repeated scripted gaslighting by customer service. Today's rep was decent enough to give me an actual day, as opposed to the previous guy's "Not to worry, you will receive an update at the earliest."
1342909202843365377 2020-12-27 03:04:38 +0800 <mcglk> After a few years of great service, @googlefi has really changed. Had a Pixel 2 for three years, paid device protection on it all that time, but it died in November. Never had any trouble w/ RMAs before, but got repeatedly thwarted. Now I'm told it won't be replaced until 1/13.
1341986147912753152 2020-12-24 13:56:45 +0800 <mcglk> @thingskatedid AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1341985871956856833 2020-12-24 13:55:39 +0800 <mcglk> StRoseCherry seems . . . deeply confused.
1341921853783199744 2020-12-24 09:41:16 +0800 <mcglk> "Bah, humbug" just doesn't cover it this year.
1341885240155901952 2020-12-24 07:15:46 +0800 <mcglk> The REAL spiritual warfare carried out by evil forces? Liars like this—the world is inundated with them, and it definitely lowers the general intelligence level of the populace.
1341884757060153344 2020-12-24 07:13:51 +0800 <mcglk> That BLACK MOLD bit? Back when it was discovered that some strains of Aspergillus could produce citric acid on an industrial scale (in 1917), people didn't even know that DNA existed. No modification was made; it was just a discovery.
1341858273972998144 2020-12-24 05:28:37 +0800 <mcglk> @GlassSpiider That's awful. I'm so very sorry.
1341654506778419201 2020-12-23 15:58:55 +0800 <mcglk> A thread about today's pardons.
1341549935229952000 2020-12-23 09:03:24 +0800 <mcglk> Wow. @Lowes absolutely savaged my hosts' Christmas—so badly I think I'm probably going to avoid Lowes for a good long time. Massive incompetence, and absolute disregard.
1341315771973001216 2020-12-22 17:32:55 +0800 <mcglk> TIL that William Sanford ("Bill") Nye was jointly granted a patent on a binary abacus in 1998.   https://t.co/0hyY8jYJSb
1341250650290569216 2020-12-22 13:14:08 +0800 <mcglk> OMG. @EricClapton and @vanmorrison, I am so very disappointed in you two.
1341245661019160576 2020-12-22 12:54:19 +0800 <mcglk> I might have been willing to give Ms Smythe another chance given a stupid mistake like this—but lying like this to absolve herself is disqualifying. Journalism schools absolutely tell you what to do when this comes up.
1341200086974402562 2020-12-22 09:53:13 +0800 <mcglk> This was always the danger posed by those who kept (keep) insisting that COVID-19 is "a hoax". The more cases there were, the more likely it is that a viable mutation would occur and the more likely it was that things will get worse. 'Way to go, maskholes.
1341148420556247041 2020-12-22 06:27:55 +0800 <mcglk> In one sense, this is a slap in the face of those who are looking at $600 to cover their bills for the next several months.  But reallocating the border-wall money for that purpose would only have been an extra $5.50 per check.  Still would have been the better choice, honestly.
1340939407453544448 2020-12-21 16:37:22 +0800 <mcglk> @thiselyzajayne @katrus @dduane Which continues to surprise me. ALON has been around since the early '80s—even before ST:TVH came out.
1340686030345621505 2020-12-20 23:50:33 +0800 <mcglk> @katzedrei Four professors signed off on it, and it was approved by three administrators. They could well have called her on it, but apparently didn't think it was that big a deal—and I tend to agree. Not an uncommon problem, either:  https://t.co/S4PHxFI0Mj
1340639921833345024 2020-12-20 20:47:19 +0800 <mcglk> @robespierrette I . . . don't.  I do remember when the GOP had the Equal Rights Amendment as part of their political platform. I miss that Republican Party, but these asshats . . . yeesh.

1340628317829918722 2020-12-20 20:01:13 +0800 <mcglk> I was an English department TA for two years. THIS is the scandal? Consistently dropping hyphens from compound adjectives (which many people do anyway)? Some typos? This is just a desperate, desperate attempt to smear Dr Biden—and not even a particularly compelling smear at that.
1340589055835209730 2020-12-20 17:25:12 +0800 <mcglk> @elonmusk Makes sense. Guaranteed to bring an abrupt halt to sexy times.
1340588681497735169 2020-12-20 17:23:43 +0800 <mcglk> A wonderful and ruefully hilarious thread. And yeah, pretty much nailed it.

1339506428856287232 2020-12-17 17:43:14 +0800 <mcglk> @GlassSpiider Remind me: Kansas?
1339504506493550592 2020-12-17 17:35:35 +0800 <mcglk> So embarrassing that this is happening in my state.
1339402337589157889 2020-12-17 10:49:36 +0800 <mcglk> @marcorubio Your pearl clutching impresses nobody, Marco. Seriously—you come off as the biggest "Christian" hypocrite of all time. At least Donald Trump never seriously claimed to believe in Jesus's teachings, but YOU . . . are an embarrassment to the very idea of Christianity. Stow it.
1339399084180819974 2020-12-17 10:36:41 +0800 <mcglk> I really, really, really hate this timeline, and all those who so callously disregard the very idea of consideration, even when it comes to life and death.  I also hope that their marriage is short and marked with many venereal diseases.
1339398159148011520 2020-12-17 10:33:00 +0800 <mcglk> @chinbeard @smartereveryday I dunno, man. They just seem like walnuts with malnutrition, y'know?
1339397712802766848 2020-12-17 10:31:14 +0800 <mcglk> @Tazerface16 Amen, brother.

1339164100459257856 2020-12-16 19:02:56 +0800 <mcglk> @thingskatedid That was one of the things I dearly loved about VAX MACRO-32—an astonishing array of instructions which, if used with sufficient creativity, made for elegant assembly code.
1339163860360556544 2020-12-16 19:01:59 +0800 <mcglk> @stuartpb @thingskatedid VAXen were 32 bits.

Way to go.
1338635793397547009 2020-12-15 08:03:38 +0800 <mcglk> @sohmer Please?

1338239549281996802 2020-12-14 05:49:06 +0800 <mcglk> @mactavish Uh . . . Samoa?
1338227514158682112 2020-12-14 05:01:17 +0800 <mcglk> It's always astonishing to me how the modern-day Democratic Party, after ekeing out an election victory with two races still on the cusp, has embedded asshats who are primarily interested in tearing the party apart as long as it can be misogynist at the same time. Ugh.
1338220858607747074 2020-12-14 04:34:50 +0800 <mcglk> @gavinesq @WSJopinion I have a very hard time believing that any part of a title you've been given would contain the word "prudence."
1338038025096372225 2020-12-13 16:28:19 +0800 <mcglk> @UhTerrible @montoure Well, obviously, ALL of us NOW.

1337916740395622400 2020-12-13 08:26:22 +0800 <mcglk> @GlassSpiider I'd like to think that the author grew a bit over the course of the last fifty years (as we all have to whatever degree), but his column about Dr Biden has me fairly convinced that he may be too determinedly stupid to be capable of it.
1337915807746048000 2020-12-13 08:22:40 +0800 <mcglk> @GlassSpiider Yeah. 'Way too familiar.
1337624492584026112 2020-12-12 13:05:05 +0800 <mcglk> So many people are just so disgusting and awful.

1337177650108932096 2020-12-11 07:29:30 +0800 <mcglk> Increasingly, I see @BotSentinel flag true statements as "disinformation alerts", and while I can see how a simple algorithm could make the mistake, this isn't a good trend.  https://t.co/1osQC7nd3j

1337168822734708737 2020-12-11 06:54:25 +0800 <mcglk> @sohmer They didn't used to. @Sephiroth144 has summarized the issue accurately—just as they were never really Democrats, they aren't really Republicans now, but they've hated being Americans since nearly the beginning of the nation.
1337163623538388993 2020-12-11 06:33:45 +0800 <mcglk> Every single person on this list needs to resign.

1336926827953020928 2020-12-10 14:52:49 +0800 <mcglk> An interesting thread. I think it's worth an official investigation.

1336546320761307136 2020-12-09 13:40:49 +0800 <mcglk> Very much worth the read.
1336450066345693185 2020-12-09 07:18:20 +0800 <mcglk> @HeroOfTimeAS @GlassSpiider Well, tell me about it sometime. :)
1336432518451478528 2020-12-09 06:08:36 +0800 <mcglk> @HeroOfTimeAS @GlassSpiider I remember. You're not the only person I know who works for Uber, though. :) (And yeah, I'm kinda glad you're not with them now, but hope for a nailed landing.)

1336355221551792128 2020-12-09 01:01:27 +0800 <mcglk> @GlassSpiider I hadn't known some of it, but I've long found Uber pretty awful overall, in spite of having people I care about work there.
1336354905397678086 2020-12-09 01:00:12 +0800 <mcglk> @ShinesFresh @walidgellad @ZacharyBrennan Not true. You are parroting lies.
1336351252842565636 2020-12-09 00:45:41 +0800 <mcglk> A really fascinating read.
1336135444178685953 2020-12-08 10:28:08 +0800 <mcglk> @Miz_Rosenberg But boy-howdy, I do understand the impatience. Try the overnight rest some other time, though, and keep me posted.
1336135356610015232 2020-12-08 10:27:47 +0800 <mcglk> @Miz_Rosenberg When I do that chocolate-chip cookie recipe, and let it hydrate, I get a bunch of complex toffee notes that really pay off. (Heck, the original Toll House cookie recipe had an overnight rest.)
1336134724452896769 2020-12-08 10:25:17 +0800 <mcglk> @Miz_Rosenberg So here's the deal.  That long rest allows the flour to hydrate. I have a recipe for chocolate-chip cookies that works best with a three-day rest in the fridge. That hydration is the difference between a cookie that's just good, and a cookie with a really complex flavor profile.
1336122844921491456 2020-12-08 09:38:04 +0800 <mcglk> @Miz_Rosenberg So, uh, would it be correct to assume that the recipe contains butter (possibly creaming the sugar and butter together)?
1336108114056105985 2020-12-08 08:39:32 +0800 <mcglk> The GOP is getting desperate—and more fascist every day.
1336071574328201217 2020-12-08 06:14:20 +0800 <mcglk> @mariachong Or, alternatively, my genitalia might disappear. Peak 2020.
1336070443510337537 2020-12-08 06:09:51 +0800 <mcglk> @mariachong I have no idea what this implies.  https://t.co/s5S0Q8W0d8
1336070160562581504 2020-12-08 06:08:43 +0800 <mcglk> Black Lives still Matter.  It almost physically hurts to see how quickly a privileged class forgets to stay furious about this major disparity. I'm just as guilty, too—I think about it several times a day, but don't say anything without some prompt.  But the need is still urgent.

1335697391815589888 2020-12-07 05:27:28 +0800 <mcglk> @MarshaWarfield No. He knows exactly what he's doing—and that makes him culpable. He may be _stupid_, granted, he may not care about anyone but himself, he may constantly lie—but he's not going to get off the hook with an insanity plea.
1335696492720340992 2020-12-07 05:23:54 +0800 <mcglk> @niais They could have been a force for great good, and long-term profitable with tremendous customer loyalty . . . but instead, they became the apathetic dude trying to sell cheap electronics from the back of a van, and I'll never understand it as long as I live. 7/7
1335696130013687808 2020-12-07 05:22:28 +0800 <mcglk> @niais Instead, its management team steered RadioShack down the stupidest, self-lobotomizing road it could find until it finally died—which was quite profitable for a very few people, and a tremendous ongoing disappointment for its customers. 6/
1335695688366129152 2020-12-07 05:20:42 +0800 <mcglk> @niais They could have given the Maker's movement a much earlier start; they could have opened up 3D printing to a much larger audience, bought and revived HeathKit, perhaps encouraged some manufacturers into creating user-serviceable and hackable household items. 5/
1335692606563487744 2020-12-07 05:08:28 +0800 <mcglk> @niais I see this sort of shortsighted bottom-line brainlessness all the time in American corporations, and it's just breathtakingly dumb every time, but none of those make me nearly as sad as losing Radio Shack. 4/
1335692362459226112 2020-12-07 05:07:29 +0800 <mcglk> @niais They aggressively cut back on all its electronic parts, abandoned most of its programs, and "updated" its brand, going to camelcase ("RadioShack") and eventually abandoning the Tandy brand entirely—just a few years before the Maker movement really got going. 3/
1335691408162746368 2020-12-07 05:03:42 +0800 <mcglk> @niais I've probably ranted about this before, but the myriad opportunities lost because its management team thought brainlessly that abandoning its customers to pursue the same sales opportunities already being taken by Walmart and BestBuy remains a tragedy to this day. 2/
1335690335968587776 2020-12-07 04:59:26 +0800 <mcglk> @niais I do. I really, really do. But let's be clear: Radio Shack was lost by its management in the mid-'90s, nearly twenty years before it went bankrupt. 1/

1335314602872041473 2020-12-06 04:06:24 +0800 <mcglk> This is a very fun thread. REFERENCE PEANUT BUTTER.
1335313182202552321 2020-12-06 04:00:46 +0800 <mcglk> A heartshattering thread. Thank you for posting this, Kate. My heart goes out to you.
1335312090085527552 2020-12-06 03:56:25 +0800 <mcglk> @mactavish WTF?
1335126336965234688 2020-12-05 15:38:18 +0800 <mcglk> @AnthonySabatini You really are this stupid, aren't you?  Resign.

1335112807331708928 2020-12-05 14:44:33 +0800 <mcglk> @OhNoSheTwitnt GREAT. Now I can't tell them apart AGAIN.
1335112645742002176 2020-12-05 14:43:54 +0800 <mcglk> @DevonESawa Definitely the latter. I usually find IKEA assembly inoffensive, and occasionally fun.
1335097247625695235 2020-12-05 13:42:43 +0800 <mcglk> @mactavish Shuri is still supposed to be smarter than that. :(

1334864826984583169 2020-12-04 22:19:09 +0800 <mcglk> Also an important thread.

1334715497816854530 2020-12-04 12:25:47 +0800 <mcglk> @andraydomise Wow. You're . . . not good at observation, are you? Or at least, you're seriously suspiciously selective at it.
1334689863560355840 2020-12-04 10:43:55 +0800 <mcglk> @LPNational Every time I feel some libertarian sympathies, the party reminds me of how aggressively stupid it is and why I'd hesitate to ever be a part of it.
1334689359316963328 2020-12-04 10:41:55 +0800 <mcglk> @s1lverFoX And when counties are the determining factor—which they never have been, ever, not even once—you might have a point. But because they aren't, . . . wow.

1334551988009201664 2020-12-04 01:36:03 +0800 <mcglk> @ksbhaskar (1) The reward is only for information leading to an arrest and conviction; this is already public. (2) It only seems to count if it's voter fraud *against* the GOP, because (3) Dan Patrick is a dishonest, hyperbolically partisan weasel.

1334233024897056768 2020-12-03 04:28:36 +0800 <mcglk> @KazePlays_JC I thought that was his brand.
1334231863146078208 2020-12-03 04:23:59 +0800 <mcglk> @GlassSpiider I've had a subscription to  https://t.co/ealkddYICg for a few years now. They occasionally produce single-grove oils and the like, which are often pretty wonderful, but even their stock olive oil is excellent. Interesting company, too.
1334067504914735107 2020-12-02 17:30:53 +0800 <mcglk> @GlassSpiider Hm. While I agree with you on most supermarket olive oil, the real stuff is pretty interesting.

1333934468227207170 2020-12-02 08:42:15 +0800 <mcglk> @NASA_Skylab Incidentally, that'd weigh about 6 million kg.
1333934323808886784 2020-12-02 08:41:40 +0800 <mcglk> @NASA_Skylab You'll need roughly 268,013 of them to equal the thrust of a single F-1 engine—for 3.45 seconds. For each F-1 for the 150 seconds of powered flight, that'll take 11,652,725 F15-4s, so the first stage would have to pack 58,263,624 engines for the same performance.
1333923316252381189 2020-12-02 07:57:56 +0800 <mcglk> @EliotKate Still trying to find your qualifications, I guess, on the pretense that you're not just totally a dishonest twatwaffle—but without any other evidence, I guess we're just gonna have to conclude that that's the only conclusion left.

1333186592144388098 2020-11-30 07:10:27 +0800 <mcglk> This is really how they "think." Stupidity really needs to be more immediately painful.

1333141930901790720 2020-11-30 04:12:59 +0800 <mcglk> @GlassSpiider And the irony is, while we had the ability to get to the moon in 1969, we absolutely didn't have the ability to fake the moon landing then—no *&amp;@#ing way. Impossible.  Still—there's Dolly Parton, but she's probably awful in some way. Humanity—what a waste.
1333136704694153216 2020-11-30 03:52:13 +0800 <mcglk> @GlassSpiider I was six years old, and humankind was exploring the moon.  Now? A significant percentage of humanity has no idea how masks work to slow the spread of disease.
1333135720249114625 2020-11-30 03:48:18 +0800 <mcglk> @GlassSpiider Yeah. A bit too much of that . . . but in retrospect, it shouldn't be so surprising. Human society—and this country's in particular—is really *@&amp;#ed up.

1333131939876794371 2020-11-30 03:33:17 +0800 <mcglk> @asusarla Honestly? For that one, where one of the operands is a power of two, I "bit-shift" (repeated doubling).  16 · 24 = 8 · 48 = 4 · 96 = 2 · 192 = 384
1333130469383180288 2020-11-30 03:27:26 +0800 <mcglk> Too true.  That's pretty much how you spend your life—watching those you adored when you were younger age out of existence, while you inexorably catch up to them eventually.

Biden has shown signs of reconsidering some of the policies of the Obama administration (as I pointed out elsewhere in the threadspace). I'd like to see a healthy debate over how this country treats whistleblowers in this country at the very least.

1331225619204431875 2020-11-24 21:18:15 +0800 <mcglk> An important thread, and well worth the read.

1331032755451301889 2020-11-24 08:31:52 +0800 <mcglk> @GlassSpiider I am unable to answer either one. I am regrettably, ridiculously het.

1330625503204577281 2020-11-23 05:33:36 +0800 <mcglk> @FreeCADNews Working my way through that, but I'm gonna stand my ground on the "open-source software interfaces need to be better" column. :)
1330604821829746689 2020-11-23 04:11:25 +0800 <mcglk> @ZLXzuHuv1f5H0jh Yes. It violates Twitter's terms of service, it violates BlueHost's affiliate policy, and it's inconsiderate as hell, barging into discussions which have nothing to do with what you're posting, interrupting them with your commercials for your own gain . . . it's COMPLETELY wrong.
1330601311998414848 2020-11-23 03:57:28 +0800 <mcglk> @ZLXzuHuv1f5H0jh Also, you're a spamhole. Reported.
1330601055550226432 2020-11-23 03:56:27 +0800 <mcglk> @ZLXzuHuv1f5H0jh Hey, @bluehost! This affiliate of yours is spamming. Whatcha gonna do about it? Do you have an anti-asshat policy?
1330589606727745537 2020-11-23 03:10:58 +0800 <mcglk> I don't want to slag free software; I have a high degree of respect for the programmers which work on it. But geez, people, put some thought into the interface. (And don't even get me started on Blender, which is still pretty horrible.)
1330589234260918272 2020-11-23 03:09:29 +0800 <mcglk> Today it's FreeCAD, which has a lot of potential. But creating a new file gives me a window with a number of buttons at the top which allow me to open a website, go forward, go back, refresh, stop loading . . . it's a web browser.

1323491635108343809 2020-11-03 13:06:09 +0800 <mcglk> The thought of forcing myself into some sort of festive mood just seems grossly unfair. I have little to celebrate.

There have been a few bright spots that have kept me from absolutely cratering, but not enough to, well, sustain. (3/6)

You are a liar, sir, but somehow, I suspect that contrition is another of those things you're "imperfect" on. Really, it's more like "proudly, belligerently betraying Christ," if you're being honest—but that, too, is a quality lacking.

I suspect we're looking at Lorain, on the western outskirts of Cleveland—which has a steel plant.

1320950586062192640 2020-10-27 12:48:56 +0800 <mcglk> Ouch.
1320945772087570432 2020-10-27 12:29:48 +0800 <mcglk> @AlbertBlundell @waltk918 @kristenschaaled That's . . . just not true. I don't know any significant politicians right now advocating for a 100% ban. There are always a few fringers, sure, but hardly the majority of "politicians not Conservative."
1320886902732419072 2020-10-27 08:35:53 +0800 <mcglk> @Torschy1 @kristenschaaled Interesting. ( https://t.co/SVHtxzqCEK). I hadn't actually known that. But then, I wasn't referring to the original patent, and am using modern parlance which has apparently been in effect for the last thirty-five years.

1320812972097241088 2020-10-27 03:42:06 +0800 <mcglk> @AlbertBlundell @waltk918 @kristenschaaled Well, no, there aren't any outright bans that I'm aware of, but owning a semiautomatic AR requires gun registration with the police, and a permit (valid for only one year) in addition to the gun license. As you say: stricter.
1320809894069506049 2020-10-27 03:29:52 +0800 <mcglk> @Jonnyfrmtheblok @waltk918 @kristenschaaled Yes . . . within certain design parameters. Design doesn't happen without limitations. If the goal was "make the gun as quiet as possible" without other parameters, suppressors would be the size of cars, and they'd reduce the sound to around 50–60dB.
1320808154632916992 2020-10-27 03:22:58 +0800 <mcglk> @AlbertBlundell @waltk918 @kristenschaaled Hm. That's a good point. Stricter gun laws seem like a reasonable suggestion.
1320806678552481792 2020-10-27 03:17:06 +0800 <mcglk> @Jonnyfrmtheblok @waltk918 @kristenschaaled Whereas you seem unclear about the entire process of design, and thus really distort what I was saying in the first place. There's a big difference between designing for "let's make this sound less deafening" and "let's make this silent."
1320627339990978562 2020-10-26 15:24:28 +0800 <mcglk> @waltk918 @kristenschaaled If they're "designed" for that instead of what they actually do, them's not good designers.
1320621844425101314 2020-10-26 15:02:38 +0800 <mcglk> @waltk918 @kristenschaaled You're not good with the listening, are you?  "Ideally you only hear the gun's action" is fantasy at best. That is not the reality of suppressors.
1320610752852443138 2020-10-26 14:18:33 +0800 <mcglk> @kristenschaaled Aw, crap. I forgot that you can't say anything reasonable about guns without the ammosexuals crawling out of the woodwork.
1320609599569838085 2020-10-26 14:13:58 +0800 <mcglk> @kristenschaaled This is a good introduction to how they work, if you're interested:  https://t.co/URNNttuyy8
1320607433463480320 2020-10-26 14:05:22 +0800 <mcglk> @kristenschaaled Well, er, no. First, they're not "silencers"; strictly speaking, they're suppressors. They still make a bang, but one that's much easier on nearby sensitive things (like ears), and that's their primary purpose. They aren't at all good for "hiding murders." Pillows, though. . . .

1320535316294295552 2020-10-26 09:18:48 +0800 <mcglk> The White House is unwilling to act. COVID-19 _can_ still be brought under control, but it will take some decisive measures that will produce a tremendous volume of whining from self-entitled asshats.
1320507682206351360 2020-10-26 07:28:59 +0800 <mcglk> @mactavish Having watched this . . . what comedian would be getting cancelled here?
1320505908586188800 2020-10-26 07:21:57 +0800 <mcglk> Geez, @joshgad. I knew you were talented, but you're doing a disturbingly good Tom Bosley at the moment, and I'm kind of blown away by it. That's downright remarkable.
1320261581658222592 2020-10-25 15:11:04 +0800 <mcglk> @mactavish Possibly. I was a colossal asshole then, but I got better.

When I started hearing that he said "good" when Biden mentioned some number of tragedies, I went to the replay (he'd said "go ahead" to the moderator), but that was about all I could stomach.

1319422556818919424 2020-10-23 07:37:05 +0800 <mcglk> @gavinesq I do like "The Sun Always Shines on TV" a lot. I also liked the fact that the video established it as the sequel to "Take On Me." "The Living Daylights"—meh. It was okay.  They did an acoustic version of "Take On Me" once; it was pretty sweetly done.   https://t.co/9pbcwQlrcA

1316906687182274560 2020-10-16 08:59:55 +0800 <mcglk> @GlassSpiider @SavannahGuthrie He's been awful for years. I don't see why NBC keeps him as the host of Meet the Press. He's not a good fit for that show at all—and never was.
1316905888976961536 2020-10-16 08:56:45 +0800 <mcglk> It won't be enough, of course; Trump supporters tend to be irrational zealots and they won't reconsider their position no matter what information they have.
1316905492455870465 2020-10-16 08:55:10 +0800 <mcglk> Okay. I loathed NBC for scheduling Trump opposite Biden in this, but @SavannahGuthrie seems the one saving grace in all this.

1312619207901675521 2020-10-04 13:03:01 +0800 <mcglk> @mactavish @herong I'd been aware of Donald Trump since the '80s.  I totally knew it would be horrible.  What disappoints me the most is how irresponsible and sociopathic the GOP at large has become.
1311829088735125505 2020-10-02 08:43:22 +0800 <mcglk> @pvponline I discovered his brain damage years ago and stopped reading then. I'm amazed that there are people who still think he's at all relevant.

1310794163386949632 2020-09-29 12:10:56 +0800 <mcglk> @mactavish Well, both poo (at COVID) and yay (for precautions).
1310786158507352064 2020-09-29 11:39:08 +0800 <mcglk> @mactavish Does anyone know if he's still slated to play at Carnegie next month?
1310151342397091840 2020-09-27 17:36:36 +0800 <mcglk> A thread.
1309992711408164866 2020-09-27 07:06:15 +0800 <mcglk> @Firstla0767905 Thanks for letting us know, troll account. I'm sure you're a perfectly legitimate person, First last 0767905.
1309989524559159296 2020-09-27 06:53:35 +0800 <mcglk> @marcorubio The assault is on truth and honor, sir, and you are in the midst of doing exactly that right now—and you don't even have the remaining religious ethics to feel any shame about it.
1309693475642695682 2020-09-26 11:17:12 +0800 <mcglk> @climaxximus Confirmed.

1309346435444293633 2020-09-25 12:18:11 +0800 <mcglk> @gavinesq @LindseyGrahamSC Sadly? Yes. I'm afraid so.
1309332471847116801 2020-09-25 11:22:42 +0800 <mcglk> @mainframed767 Mine was an old 80386 (DX? Hah). Got Slackware running on it, bashed it around a bit, came away unimpressed. Later I installed FreeBSD on it, and liked it better. The hardware didn't survive long; after that, I built a '486 P4 system that kept me happy for a couple of years.
1309312096186691584 2020-09-25 10:01:44 +0800 <mcglk> @mactavish Temporary. Until attention is diverted. Then right back at work. At least, if we follow the SPD's usual pattern.
1309311629603921920 2020-09-25 09:59:52 +0800 <mcglk> I really need to post more stuff on government accountability. I got so many good blocks in today.
1309236148900737025 2020-09-25 04:59:56 +0800 <mcglk> @jackmeridan New to Twitter, "Chief"?
1309191999212273666 2020-09-25 02:04:30 +0800 <mcglk> It's always interesting to me that when I post something involving police accountability, the pro-fascism and racist tweets just flow in. Not nearly enough people in this country feel particularly strongly about democracy, it seems.
1309040237461622785 2020-09-24 16:01:28 +0800 <mcglk> @SeattlePD I wonder how much of this is at all true. Just no way to tell when a police organization has been caught lying so many times.
1308898805568372737 2020-09-24 06:39:28 +0800 <mcglk> @amateur_arguer @gavinesq Well, to be fair: Yes.  (A lovely photo, by the way.)

1308631730274758656 2020-09-23 12:58:12 +0800 <mcglk> @amateur_arguer Emulsion: two liquids with different properties evenly dispersed (in peanut butter, this is usually peanut oil and palm oil; the former is liquid at room temp, the other is not, so it becomes semisolid) that may hold other things (peanut particles, in this case).
1308631525013909504 2020-09-23 12:57:23 +0800 <mcglk> @amateur_arguer Suspension: small solid particles suspended in a liquid.
1308626006773702656 2020-09-23 12:35:27 +0800 <mcglk> @amateur_arguer The answer: It depends.  Natural peanut butter (no emulsifiers) is a suspension. The particles of peanut are suspended in a base of peanut oil.  The no-stir variety is an emulsion.

1308215126974029825 2020-09-22 09:22:46 +0800 <mcglk> An important thread by someone I respect highly.
1308150405096906753 2020-09-22 05:05:35 +0800 <mcglk> @LNslovebites So, like all the other ones, then. Typical.

1307182231987732486 2020-09-19 12:58:25 +0800 <mcglk> I just found out about RBG. I feel ill.  I assume that McConnell will hold to the precedent he established. Right? Right?

1306673456163901442 2020-09-18 03:16:43 +0800 <mcglk> @Alex_Kack All the feels, man.
1306673351419543552 2020-09-18 03:16:18 +0800 <mcglk> @FruitOnBottom @christopherink @jbx_rn @TheRealDoctorT Much too nice a word to apply to someone like that. I just blocked him, because he's certainly not contributing anything interesting or intelligent to the conversation.
1306672709984632838 2020-09-18 03:13:45 +0800 <mcglk> @christopherink @Sudenveri But never mind, "hunty." You're eminently ignorable. I hope your husband is less of an utter twat.
1306672560541585408 2020-09-18 03:13:09 +0800 <mcglk> @christopherink @Sudenveri You seem confused. I mean, it's becoming sort of on-brand for you. So far, nobody has been demeaning; they've all challenged your assertions without being insulting, and there has been perhaps a bit of ridicule of you holding people to standards that you clearly don't meet.
1306671877658566656 2020-09-18 03:10:27 +0800 <mcglk> @christopherink @FruitOnBottom @jbx_rn @TheRealDoctorT And I will once again point out that there are plenty of vegans and vegetarians out there with diabetes and hypertension, and that there's no assurance or evidence that switching to such a diet would help "wean" them off necessary medications. Facts ... SO inconvenient.
1306670606436376577 2020-09-18 03:05:23 +0800 <mcglk> @christopherink @FruitOnBottom @jbx_rn @TheRealDoctorT As long as you have, it sounds like. Except it appears I actually know more about this than you do. Go figure.
1306670343721869312 2020-09-18 03:04:21 +0800 <mcglk> @christopherink @Sudenveri And goes right for the demeaning comment. Nicely done. You're certainly checking off all the boxes.
1306669911897329665 2020-09-18 03:02:38 +0800 <mcglk> @christopherink @FruitOnBottom @jbx_rn @TheRealDoctorT Well, the comic certainly comes across knowing more than you, husband-of-a-certified-lifestyle-whatever-physician.
1306669036722221057 2020-09-18 02:59:09 +0800 <mcglk> @christopherink @FruitOnBottom @jbx_rn @TheRealDoctorT Goodness. So he took a four-hour exam with 150 multiple-choice questions and paid $1700. Well, you've certainly convinced me that facts are wrong.
1306667453045325824 2020-09-18 02:52:52 +0800 <mcglk> @FruitOnBottom @christopherink @jbx_rn @TheRealDoctorT Not only that, but it's not "established medical and nutritional science." If plant-based diets always addressed diabetes, sure—but there are plenty of vegetarian and vegan diabetics out there. If plant-based diets always reduced blood pressure—sure, but ditto. It's nonsense.
1306666803964207105 2020-09-18 02:50:17 +0800 <mcglk> A powerful thread.

1306068373915140097 2020-09-16 11:12:20 +0800 <mcglk> A worthy thread.

1306027466218041344 2020-09-16 08:29:47 +0800 <mcglk> @Theturdtree @JayInslee Well, I gotta say, I've rarely seen a more accurate username.
1306027024671059969 2020-09-16 08:28:02 +0800 <mcglk> @AnEngagedLife @jasonrantz @GovInslee Oh, sorry. I seem to have stumbled upon a pile of utter horseshit.
1306026107435708417 2020-09-16 08:24:23 +0800 <mcglk> @jasonrantz Oh. Right. I forgot I hadn't blocked your unhinged ass.
1305957106822963200 2020-09-16 03:50:12 +0800 <mcglk> I gotta say, @jimcramer: You blew it in that interview, and your subsequent self-justification is disingenuous at best. You owe Pelosi—and your viewers—a sincere apology. It's about the only thing you can do.
1305720186306064390 2020-09-15 12:08:46 +0800 <mcglk> She's an embarrassment to my state.

But you managed an amazing tribute—the cadence, the accent, the character—enough that I teared up. Thank you; it was brilliant.

1304459799686295552 2020-09-12 00:40:26 +0800 <mcglk> @jearle Actual _scientists_ want to know about the transmissibility. But our respective administrations just seem to want to tra-la-la over that point.
1304459498241761280 2020-09-12 00:39:14 +0800 <mcglk> @jearle And tents, and RVs, and . . . er, Very Close Proximity. But it's gonna be a while before we can get enough information to determine what were the riskiest things and what were relatively safe.
1304457707580055553 2020-09-12 00:32:07 +0800 <mcglk> @jearle Though there's been a lot of fallout from Sturgis, which is primarily an outdoor event. I wish we knew more about this virus's transmissibility.
1304363181943316487 2020-09-11 18:16:31 +0800 <mcglk> @amateur_arguer Well, it's not from an overabundance of honesty.
1304181862156304384 2020-09-11 06:16:01 +0800 <mcglk> In short, he's the same sort of bottom-feeder as Trump, but the rules allow him to suck up in this way to both Putin and Trump. Disgusting, but that's who the man is.
1304181422022733824 2020-09-11 06:14:16 +0800 <mcglk> His name is Christian Tybring-Gjedde, and he's been a supporter of Vladimir Putin for years, not a fan of US foreign policy before Trump came along, and is a climate denier and white nationalist.  It's also not the first time he's done this; he nominated Trump two years ago, too.
1304180510113951746 2020-09-11 06:10:38 +0800 <mcglk> So, about that Nobel Prize nomination that the GOP is so ecstatic about.  Note that any member of the Norwegian parliament can nominate anyone for the Nobel Peace Prize, so it make sense that it would be a far-right anti-immigrant Islamophobic nationalist, right?
1304172751750492160 2020-09-11 05:39:49 +0800 <mcglk> @krisstraub @RegretaGarbo Well, if the choice is between someone trained as a carpenter, and between someone who arguably trains lawyers, . . .

1304117397238947843 2020-09-11 01:59:51 +0800 <mcglk> @mactavish He's genuinely disgusting.
1304084014882455552 2020-09-10 23:47:12 +0800 <mcglk> @SaraLUckelman You might even be able to rid yourself of another overfull box by adding some squishiness to that glue; perhaps \hskip 0.05em plus 0.0167em minus 0.0167em. (That will give you a normal 1/20em space, but range up to 1/15em and down to 1/30em, I believe.)
1304080610445590528 2020-09-10 23:33:40 +0800 <mcglk> Hi, @ESDwaWorks. I reopened my unemployment claim last month, but have been unable to file claims through the website, and my secure messages have so far been ignored—and I'm starting to get a little desperate. What's the best way to try to resolve this?
1304075998011338753 2020-09-10 23:15:21 +0800 <mcglk> @sallylepage HEY. Back the heck up, Newton.
1304075189941014530 2020-09-10 23:12:08 +0800 <mcglk> @SaraLUckelman Yes, I just saw that in your replies myself. It's an elegant solution. Thanks for being sure I saw it.
1304073664166469636 2020-09-10 23:06:04 +0800 <mcglk> @SaraLUckelman I answered "No," but there are some fonts that benefit from a hairspace or thinspace around em-dashes. That said, a full space emphasizes the em-dash, which isn't really the better option. If given the choice between full space and no space, please choose the latter.
1304069455715004416 2020-09-10 22:49:21 +0800 <mcglk> @ClemenSamuels @mudede @TheStranger Would you mind explaining briefly why you are profa? I'm just curious.

1303709328545738752 2020-09-09 22:58:20 +0800 <mcglk> @amateur_arguer Millennia of sociological conditioning based on societal norms, roles and expectations. Under that question of yours lurks a big complicated seething morass of a deeply unsatisfying answer. 1/∞

1302965046323019782 2020-09-07 21:40:49 +0800 <mcglk> This thread. I admit, I may have developed a small crush, and I hope she trounces her opposition. I didn't have much, but made a donation anyway.
1302691989432008704 2020-09-07 03:35:47 +0800 <mcglk> @jengalovely You looked amazing with it.
1302691784112238592 2020-09-07 03:34:58 +0800 <mcglk> @gavinesq He has already. Unless you think that being incoherent and belligerently irrational doesn't count.
1302629076511854592 2020-09-06 23:25:48 +0800 <mcglk> A brief and infuriating thread.
1302523022717251584 2020-09-06 16:24:22 +0800 <mcglk> An instructive thread on landlord scum.
1302397298970734593 2020-09-06 08:04:48 +0800 <mcglk> @JoofGreenGables I wasn't grading your spelling; I knew what you meant. :)
1302387997761892352 2020-09-06 07:27:50 +0800 <mcglk> @Cathrinmachin It kills me that at the time you started selling your artwork, I lost the ability to buy any of it, and don't even have a place to put if it I could buy any of it.  Someday. But it's hard watching these go by. :/
1302348612559466496 2020-09-06 04:51:20 +0800 <mcglk> A beautiful and meaningful thread.
1302303585263263745 2020-09-06 01:52:25 +0800 <mcglk> @chipnanimus I gather fives for this sort of thing. First thing I do is borrow what I need to round up the first number to the nearest five.  27 + 48 = 30 + 45 = 75
1302270389309988865 2020-09-05 23:40:30 +0800 <mcglk> @andersleijersta Because they are astonishingly lovely and talented. Thanks for bringing out the racist trolls, by the way; I've got some blocking to do.
1302247143839682560 2020-09-05 22:08:08 +0800 <mcglk> @Jim_Jordan Fake American.
1302219316490719242 2020-09-05 20:17:33 +0800 <mcglk> @stillgray Wow. Stealing someone else's content AND lying about the content. You're such a Super American, aren't you?
1302198332232613888 2020-09-05 18:54:10 +0800 <mcglk> So feel free to use it. Cloacadytism is everywhere these days; may as well have a fancy label for it. Enjoy.
1302198140615798785 2020-09-05 18:53:25 +0800 <mcglk> So I came up with the term "cloacadyte," which means sewer-dweller. It seems particularly relevant in this age of Trump, Qanon, and all the rest of the ugly stupidity we're seeing in the present political climate.
1302197798142578690 2020-09-05 18:52:03 +0800 <mcglk> While "troglodyte" means cave-dweller, and has been used as a means of describing an uncultured, base person, I think it's too nice a term for that. There's nothing wrong with cave-dwellers.
1302197462120108032 2020-09-05 18:50:43 +0800 <mcglk> In a conversation today, I used a word I coined some years ago. I don't know if it existed prior to that, but for the moment, I'm just saying, "I think I invented this, and it should be in wider use."

1302163687512264704 2020-09-05 16:36:30 +0800 <mcglk> @amateur_arguer Which, I suppose, is actually a good argument for not getting your information from a single source.
1302163583724171264 2020-09-05 16:36:06 +0800 <mcglk> @amateur_arguer In fairness, what he actually said was "Moreover, one hadith states that those who have sexual intercourse with their hands will find their hands pregnant in the afterlife, complaining against them to God over its rights."

1302022820533166081 2020-09-05 07:16:45 +0800 <mcglk> @LiveAction @US_FDA You lie. First, that's well beyond seven weeks. Second, if we only have your word to go on, and you are demonstrably dishonest, why should we believe any of this account?  Reproductive freedom is important, @US_FDA. Ignore these dishonest zealots.
1301996655521263616 2020-09-05 05:32:47 +0800 <mcglk> @amateur_arguer To which the obvious response is "Shut up, Dad."
1301798018933424128 2020-09-04 16:23:28 +0800 <mcglk> @TheLincoln I use it more often than you'd think; it's a good way to closely tie two different concepts more closely than a period would, without having to mess with a conjunction. (Yes, that was a titch contrived, but you see my point, I hope.)
1301695574815641600 2020-09-04 09:36:24 +0800 <mcglk> @cjohnsonspider2 Absolutely; I'd remember those remarks about it being best for the economy if the vulnerable would just resign themselves to dying of COVID. Not the kind of doctor I'd want.
1301626806970187776 2020-09-04 05:03:08 +0800 <mcglk> "Excessive-force lawsuit"? Why isn't this a murder charge?
1301612315721084928 2020-09-04 04:05:33 +0800 <mcglk> @robespierrette No argument from me, on any of those points. I just worry that we've got too many grifters, cynics, and Qaninnies.
1301605303507542016 2020-09-04 03:37:41 +0800 <mcglk> @robespierrette What an unbelievable, corrupt cockup. That's really one of the biggest reasons to vote Democratic this year up and down the ballot: actual investigations.
1301520548296450048 2020-09-03 22:00:54 +0800 <mcglk> @LNslovebites @AnneliRoberts No longer responds to his name.  https://t.co/hhjpOHBM7Q
1301440687712251904 2020-09-03 16:43:34 +0800 <mcglk> Rochester NY this time. As people have been saying for some time, this is also a preventable pandemic.
1301286080113590272 2020-09-03 06:29:12 +0800 <mcglk> A thread involving a story with a happy ending, yet a tragic circumstance that's overdue for some serious attention.
1301285216242155521 2020-09-03 06:25:46 +0800 <mcglk> @adamcarolla I haven't been reminded of you in years, but it's oddly comforting to know that you've retained the same thought-free, mean-spirited stupidity over all that time.
1301263260918800384 2020-09-03 04:58:32 +0800 <mcglk> Absolutely nailed it.
1301237986164572160 2020-09-03 03:18:06 +0800 <mcglk> @CupcakeGoth @DarkFeyFanClub @Caliban1227 @ReverendMalcus Ugh. So oppressive, especially for 2020. Let's be honest: This is the very best year for Jilli to have instant fire on hand.
1301236738036170752 2020-09-03 03:13:08 +0800 <mcglk> @GlassSpiider @Saratoldya If I had been born a girl, my parents talked about naming me after both my grandmothers.  I would have been Minnie Mildred McGlothlen.
1301115291842224129 2020-09-02 19:10:33 +0800 <mcglk> A thread.
1300677854527512576 2020-09-01 14:12:20 +0800 <mcglk> @LNslovebites Her name was Cheryl Weeden. It took until 1998 for me to purge her phone number from my mind. I have no idea where she wound up, who she turned out to be, and I'm more than certain she'd have no memory of who I was.
1300654501901209601 2020-09-01 12:39:32 +0800 <mcglk> @indyfromspace I think @CupcakeGoth really should see this.
