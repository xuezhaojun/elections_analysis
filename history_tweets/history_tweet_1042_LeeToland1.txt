1342656417308798977 2020-12-26 10:20:09 +0800 <LeeToland1> @GretaThunberg Go back to school ye stupid wee bastard!
1342577944519204870 2020-12-26 05:08:20 +0800 <LeeToland1> MERRY CHRISTMAS!
1342202895475879936 2020-12-25 04:18:01 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Kevin_Barry @Casserly_Rock @gerlawlor2508 @CKee09120569 @Niall_Boylan had the statistics on his show the other day. You can also view them at  https://t.co/nqbSzMSnft!
1341818506535428100 2020-12-24 02:50:36 +0800 <LeeToland1> @RealNiallMcCall Exactly, how they expect us to show them some empathy when they showed none to the Care Homes or to the mental health of this Country as the continue to lock us in like Circus animals!
1341702691534364672 2020-12-23 19:10:23 +0800 <LeeToland1> RTE IS THE VIRUS!
1341698400207724544 2020-12-23 18:53:20 +0800 <LeeToland1> @mondaygirl @gerlawlor2508 @CKee09120569 @Niall_Boylan Take a look at the outbreaks since March and where they occurred. This is all about compliance and control by the Government. They're even blaming us for getting sick now for their disastrous healthcare system. People should be in jail!
1341633272707629057 2020-12-23 14:34:33 +0800 <LeeToland1> @sweenboy45 @CKee09120569 @AaronOBrien78 @gerlawlor2508 The virus is a pile of shite, it's not as near "dangerous" as pneumonia or influenza. SHEEPLE like you are easily Brainwashed. Lockdowns haven't worked, masks haven't worked. Your Country won't work either when we are all on the poverty line. Definition of "all in this together"!
1341632641439817728 2020-12-23 14:32:02 +0800 <LeeToland1> @sweenboy45 @CKee09120569 @gerlawlor2508 You probably had hay fever ya clown!
1341632169454743552 2020-12-23 14:30:10 +0800 <LeeToland1> @mondaygirl @gerlawlor2508 @CKee09120569 @Niall_Boylan do you have the link for this. I seen it tweeted a few times by many people!
1341632028672991232 2020-12-23 14:29:36 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Casserly_Rock @gerlawlor2508 @CKee09120569 No, People or SHEEPLE like you are the problem. Easily brainwashed and manipulated. Nothing good will come of this. Do you know how many Covid Cases since March arises from Pubs? 23 How many from Restaurants? 42 Barbers/Hairdressers? 5 CareHomes/Hospitals 4,000 +
1341170536588701696 2020-12-22 07:55:48 +0800 <LeeToland1> @gerlawlor2508 @CKee09120569 Ger, at some stage in life we all have to die. Did they really die "from" Covid though? They are putting down Covid for nearly every death. Someone fell off a roof and they put it down as Covid. As you are well aware, Doctors get paid more when it is put down as a "Covid" death!
1341158755766038529 2020-12-22 07:08:59 +0800 <LeeToland1> There you have it. Almost confirmed on Claire Byrne Live, more or less. They couldn't even give us Christmas and the New Year. Lockdown 3.0 on the way. We need a revolution in this Country, because people are beyond brainwashed at this stage!
1341122447760887808 2020-12-22 04:44:43 +0800 <LeeToland1> There was much more people in Hospital this time last year with Pneumonia, Influenza and other respiratory diseases, all which are more lethal than Covid-19. Even when Covid disappears, what's to stop them using Influenza as an excuse to do this every year?
1341025427347959809 2020-12-21 22:19:11 +0800 <LeeToland1> Imagine, we could now possibly face criminal charges if we make politically incorrect statements. What has happened to our freedom of speech. "Thought Crime". What even is that? What has happened our Country, it's being destroyed. Beyond ridiculous!
1340813835817639938 2020-12-21 08:18:24 +0800 <LeeToland1> PRESIDENT @realDonaldTrump won the Election and Joe Biden didn't. That's it, that's the tweet!
1340392893006098433 2020-12-20 04:25:43 +0800 <LeeToland1> Which Party should I join? VOTE!
1340392890011365378 2020-12-20 04:25:42 +0800 <LeeToland1> Hllllll
1339934495143841795 2020-12-18 22:04:13 +0800 <LeeToland1> What Political Party should I join?
1339934407591927808 2020-12-18 22:03:52 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Kintsugi4u You clearly don't look at the facts. Another weed-smoking conspiracy theorist!
1339934292248551424 2020-12-18 22:03:24 +0800 <LeeToland1> @davok64 If we legalise it, drug lords will take over and run our Country and we'll be like California. High in crime, Homelessness and mental health. NO WAY!
1339934089890164736 2020-12-18 22:02:36 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Dublin_Digest You won't be able to get PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, but they'll allow you to access weed on the market. COME ON!
1339933922763960321 2020-12-18 22:01:56 +0800 <LeeToland1> @TimesOfDeceit "Alot of people", here we go with the warped in the Brain, weed-smoking conspiracy theorists. Look at the risks and th studies, nurses told me how they were always paranoid after taking it and were never the same!
1339933446798536704 2020-12-18 22:00:03 +0800 <LeeToland1> Shane Codd- Get out my head a WILE TUNE! 😎
1339931169232707587 2020-12-18 21:51:00 +0800 <LeeToland1> @realTomMcBride I followed the guidelines the first two times, stringently, but Lockdown 3 is taking the biscuit. I will go about my everyday life as normal as possible. Stress and anxiety will break immune systems down, not Covid-19. Don't let Coronavirus ruin your lives!
1339930348763885569 2020-12-18 21:47:44 +0800 <LeeToland1> Jesus went 40 days without food. Bobby Sands went 66. Jesus a gimp!
1339897670375272450 2020-12-18 19:37:53 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Dublin_Digest It'll give our already crammed hospitals and mental health institutions more work than they can already handle. It's a gateway for mass crime!
1339894713835532289 2020-12-18 19:26:08 +0800 <LeeToland1> ...Why is it then that he can go to jail for it, but we are talking about legalising it? I've said it for years, legalising weed will give Drug Gangs an extra edge to deal dirty and cause violence and crime the likes of which we've never seen before!
1339894179221151746 2020-12-18 19:24:01 +0800 <LeeToland1> Why should we legalise Cannabis? Cannabis today is more dangerous than the versions available to People 20 years ago. It leaves people with mental health problems. What did John Gilligan start up with and build up a large percentage of his empire with? Cigarettes and CANNABIS!
1339728146560638976 2020-12-18 08:24:15 +0800 <LeeToland1> With 10% of voters pro LEAVE in 2016 and more than 30% in 2019, the appetite is there to exit the E.U.! @IrexitFreedom #Irexit #IrishFreedom
1339717653150220291 2020-12-18 07:42:33 +0800 <LeeToland1> This is sad, let people decide if they want to wear them or not. Tell me again how our Government is supportive to its citizens?
1339645657691418625 2020-12-18 02:56:28 +0800 <LeeToland1> Everyone that posts their Snapchat year recap on their stories can fuck off. Nobody wants to see your shite!

1339243401825366017 2020-12-17 00:18:03 +0800 <LeeToland1> What's the difference between Hitler and MaryLou McDonald? Nothing. They both hate the Jewish community!

1338951232019423232 2020-12-16 04:57:04 +0800 <LeeToland1> Anyone that doesn't like Jaffa Cakes are mentally challenged!
1338925016453419011 2020-12-16 03:12:54 +0800 <LeeToland1> @FlattenTheLies @Niall_Boylan @BulelaniMfaco Anyone that enters Ireland, or any Country for that matter, who shouldn't have done so without going through the correct process (legally entering another Country), should be deported and that's the end of it. Leave, come back and enter legally!

1337572376977043459 2020-12-12 09:38:00 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Niall_Boylan It's disgusting, looking forward to speaking about it on the show, tomorrow. Thanks Niall!

1337018480323928069 2020-12-10 20:57:00 +0800 <LeeToland1> Who did @eimid_ McLaughlin report and what is he hiding?
1337017772505706497 2020-12-10 20:54:12 +0800 <LeeToland1> Where's Bill Rochdayle?

1336981867384496130 2020-12-10 18:31:31 +0800 <LeeToland1> @eimid_ I don't think people with differing opinions on Politics necessarily can't get along. Sometimes, that's a key factor actually in their formation. The respect one another's views, without ever stepping across the aisle!
1336976269225947136 2020-12-10 18:09:17 +0800 <LeeToland1> You don't have to try and force your beliefs onto someone else either!
1336974557861859329 2020-12-10 18:02:29 +0800 <LeeToland1> @PadraigMacL @eimid_ You'll just steal some grants probably, so it's all good!
1336973942255443971 2020-12-10 18:00:02 +0800 <LeeToland1> @eimid_ What's Hams said to you now sir!
1336973892485787650 2020-12-10 17:59:50 +0800 <LeeToland1> @eimid_ RATTLED!
1336228738439278592 2020-12-08 16:38:51 +0800 <LeeToland1> We've become a nation that gives our politicians a pass for breaking their own lockdown orders but sits back &amp; allows those same politicians to fine business owners &amp; yank their licenses for trying to support their families.   Something is terribly wrong with this picture!
1335924396289093632 2020-12-07 20:29:31 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Niall_Boylan It could take 5 years for an Irish family to get on the housing list. It takes on average 11 months for an "Asylum Seeker" to get a home and it's truly a disgrace Niall. Ultimately, we need to leave the European Union and that's the bottom line!
1335924060140810242 2020-12-07 20:28:10 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Niall_Boylan No, not until we help ourselves first. I care about my family, I don't care about someone else's problems back home in Syria!
1335918528143224833 2020-12-07 20:06:11 +0800 <LeeToland1> Ben Shapiro is OUTSTANDING to watch and to listen to and if you don't like him, it's because you are offended by the facts. Facts don't care about your feelings!
1335714111829790720 2020-12-07 06:33:55 +0800 <LeeToland1> @MusicCityPromo Don't believe in the FAKE NEWS MAINSTREAM MEDIA!

Biden had 306 Electoral College votes, now it's 279. His "lead" is DWINDLING! #BidenWasNotElected #StopTheSteaI #StopTheGreatReset #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #MAGA
1335393702957748228 2020-12-06 09:20:43 +0800 <LeeToland1> @kenolin1 @kenolin1 he actually did WIN. Votes were being counted past the deadline. It's called ELECTION DAY not ELECTION WEEK!
1335392752637505537 2020-12-06 09:16:57 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Amy_Siskind @Amy_Siskind, he didn't lose decisively. He actually won, he was winning everywhere. More and more votes kept coming in after the deadline. It's called ELECTION DAY not ELECTION WEEK!

1335018351333085187 2020-12-05 08:29:13 +0800 <LeeToland1> The E.U. will make us take the Vaccine. Remember that!

1334145267637972994 2020-12-02 22:39:53 +0800 <LeeToland1> @ColonelCapital Like what? Enforce Asylum Seekers into Ireland and if we say no, Punish us? It's because of them l, in part, that we have a Homeless Crisis which is the talk of the World. We have to take these crooks in and leave our own to die in despair!
1334118205367971840 2020-12-02 20:52:21 +0800 <LeeToland1> How is this Gender Balance? You just nominated 6 females😂😂😂
1334092829245771776 2020-12-02 19:11:31 +0800 <LeeToland1> @eimid_ I'm not taking any European Union Vaccine sir. After all, they said they'd make it Mandatory. It's on tape!
1334092646986485760 2020-12-02 19:10:47 +0800 <LeeToland1> IRELAND NEEDS TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION!
1333810332746342403 2020-12-02 00:28:58 +0800 <LeeToland1> I seen a video of a major person from the E.U., who said that they would be looking to make the Covid Vaccine MANDATORY. I Retweeted it 1-2 weeks ago, but can't find it. Can someone find it for me?
1333736960586870785 2020-12-01 19:37:25 +0800 <LeeToland1> Can anyone find that video where a high ranking member of the E.U. is talking about making Vaccinations, MANDATORY. I Retweeted it, but it might be a week or two ago and it's very difficult to find. Can someone find it?
1333710028193345536 2020-12-01 17:50:24 +0800 <LeeToland1> Does anybody have that clip of a speech made by the E.U., around a week or so ago where they are talking about making the Covid Vaccine, Mandatory?
1333688909201625090 2020-12-01 16:26:29 +0800 <LeeToland1> Joe Biden is not President Elect. Donald Trump is the President.
1333688742649925633 2020-12-01 16:25:49 +0800 <LeeToland1> It's clear as day Joe Biden didn't win democratically. Joe Biden CHEATED!
1333688593630584832 2020-12-01 16:25:14 +0800 <LeeToland1> If Joe Biden won so deservingly and fair and square, why are they trying to wipe the voter machines before Judges in several states get to inspect them? 👍🤔
1333688098383949824 2020-12-01 16:23:16 +0800 <LeeToland1> They're been trying to get rid of Trump for the last 4 years and when I say they, I mean Nancy Pelosi. Russian Collusion? ❌ Obstruction of Justice? ❌ Special Counsel? ❌ Impeachment?❌ Illegal Mail-In Balloting?  They are trying to steal this Election. Joe Biden CHEATED!
1333687441908248576 2020-12-01 16:20:39 +0800 <LeeToland1> The only spike in numbers Sleepy Joe Biden had with black voters, were in Swing States. Up and down the Ballot he done horrible with the black vote, which Trump done better with again than in 2016. Republicans kept the Senate, Red Wave in the House, won all Governor races. FRAUD!
1333686936003895299 2020-12-01 16:18:38 +0800 <LeeToland1> YOU CAN GET VIRUSES THROUGH YOUR EARS!
1333686822904471552 2020-12-01 16:18:11 +0800 <LeeToland1> JOE BIDEN CHEATED IN THIS ELECTION. DONALD TRUMP WON THIS ELECTION.
1333684999619547145 2020-12-01 16:10:57 +0800 <LeeToland1> Your vote by Mail has to be creased as it's folded. Why aren't Biden's mail in votes creased? Because they were all filled out at these voting centres, when they didn't allow poll watchers to attend and observe, which is illegal! @realDonaldTrump
1333680839096479744 2020-12-01 15:54:25 +0800 <LeeToland1> JOE BIDEN CHEATED!
1333558985115504641 2020-12-01 07:50:13 +0800 <LeeToland1> You can actually get Viruses through your ears, so stop peddling the bs about masks please. Thanks!
1333555667404271617 2020-12-01 07:37:02 +0800 <LeeToland1> You can catch Viruses through your ears, so this nonsense that masks work is a load of shite!
1333554756036517891 2020-12-01 07:33:24 +0800 <LeeToland1> Why are the Government trying to force Covid Vaccines down our throats. I thought it was "My Body My Choice" ? I'm not taking any Vaccine anyway!
1333126444919238659 2020-11-30 03:11:27 +0800 <LeeToland1> @RealNiallMcCall Thanks Niall, appreciate it!
1333126353462435843 2020-11-30 03:11:05 +0800 <LeeToland1> Is it only 1 Hour 45mins in a Pub that serves food again, rightn'uf?
1333081822616580104 2020-11-30 00:14:08 +0800 <LeeToland1> @ronanhoran True, no talk about it now whatsoever!
1333080369386692610 2020-11-30 00:08:22 +0800 <LeeToland1> @LarryBrindisi Average ages of the deaths are 85 years old and even they have a quite high recovery rate!
1333079342604296194 2020-11-30 00:04:17 +0800 <LeeToland1> Why are we hiding behind the Sofas because of Covid-19. It has a 99% recovery rate and the flu is more deathly. We weren't tip toeing around then, wearing masks and acting like sheep!
1333078826923003907 2020-11-30 00:02:14 +0800 <LeeToland1> RTE Fake News want to silence everyone. Masks so we can no longer breath as a means to silence us and change our quality of life. They try to censor us and they are Government Propaganda. They are FAKE NEWS!
1333078077174329345 2020-11-29 23:59:15 +0800 <LeeToland1> MAKE IRELAND GREAT AGAIN!
1332976019339440130 2020-11-29 17:13:43 +0800 <LeeToland1> @GregHughes2 @TirChonaill1 this is wide scale Corruption!
1332975336053637123 2020-11-29 17:11:00 +0800 <LeeToland1> @GregHughes2 @griptmedia run with this story please and get the truth out. We do not have room at the Inn. There's 10,000 homeless and 3,500+ are Children. DP must end NOW! @RebBarrettNP @beachbuminkerry @ddi @hermannkelly @AitheantasEire @AltviewIreland @RenuaDonegal @CaseyPeterJ @ih8evrybdy
1332973189710966788 2020-11-29 17:02:28 +0800 <LeeToland1> @ChrisFaulkner97 CORRUPTION!
1332972601199779846 2020-11-29 17:00:08 +0800 <LeeToland1> Direct Provision Centres should be all ABOLISHED. The Corruption in this Country is far greater than what anyone can understand. 10,000 People homeless, 3,500+ are Children! We cannot take in any more "Asylum Seekers". There's no more room at the Inn! @Niall_Boylan @griptmedia
1332971955759288320 2020-11-29 16:57:34 +0800 <LeeToland1> @GregHughes2 @GregHughes2 you need to come out on air and condemn this. We DO NOT have the room in this Country to be taking in "Asylum Seekers". We will take them in when we take in our own, FIRST. That's how it works. What about the 3,500 PLUS Children that's are homeless today, Greg?
1332971134694907907 2020-11-29 16:54:18 +0800 <LeeToland1> Thomas Pringle may as well come out and say he supports Sinn Féin or is a secret member of Sinn Féin at this point!
1332970948463620096 2020-11-29 16:53:34 +0800 <LeeToland1> @ThomasPringleTD once a wanker, always a wanker. Him supporting the mass surge of "Asylum Seekers" into Ireland is a disgrace. What about the unfortunate people already on the streets, do they not matter? Or the 3,500 plus CHILDREN , Thomas? Remember this at the Ballot Box folks!
1332969078273814533 2020-11-29 16:46:08 +0800 <LeeToland1> @ThomasPringleTD @eimid_ @ThomasPringleTD you are a disgrace and a traitor to the people of Donegal, and Ireland. There's 10,000 plus homeless today, many of them Irish. 3,500 are CHILDREN. We can't take in any more and forget and neglect our own. You couldn't be further up the Fascist E.U.'s arse!
1332806888115892224 2020-11-29 06:01:39 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Neil76161064 @beachbuminkerry any of those Green Hats going?
1332799845279674371 2020-11-29 05:33:39 +0800 <LeeToland1> @PhilONe00893148 @BulbuliaBrendan When we had freedom, a way of life and a purpose. That's gone now. Let's put the Irish people here, FIRST!
1332497048097222658 2020-11-28 09:30:27 +0800 <LeeToland1> Very easy to say New Zealand and Australia done well with Covid when they have no land borders!
1332492795555274752 2020-11-28 09:13:33 +0800 <LeeToland1> How much coke was Ryan Turbridy on tonight?
1332109028101656578 2020-11-27 07:48:36 +0800 <LeeToland1> @fowler_bart You should get onto @TheYankeeCandle, Bart!!
1331953726857293825 2020-11-26 21:31:29 +0800 <LeeToland1> What I listened to on The @Niall_Boylan Show was chilling. I'm angry, furious and upset by what this Government has done to the mindset of not just adults, but now Children too. I'm fuming!
1331953409994448901 2020-11-26 21:30:14 +0800 <LeeToland1> People can't see their loved ones because of Covid-19. Now, parents can barely see their children because their children do not want to leave their rooms in fear of touching anything or getting any germs. The response by the Government is a disgrace and it's putting driving FEAR!
1331950833253167106 2020-11-26 21:19:59 +0800 <LeeToland1> ... mentioned suicide. What the hell is our Government, NPHET, Stephen Donnelly and Tony Holohan doing? They are destroying people's lives. They are instilling fear and anxiety into People of this Country. Stress and Anxiety will break down people's immune systems, not Covid-19!
1331950158112841730 2020-11-26 21:17:18 +0800 <LeeToland1> Just listening to the Niall Boylan show and a concerned caller called in to say her 9 year-old daughter's OCD and Anxiety levels have gone sky high. She believes her mother and father are going to kill her and poison her. All because of Covid. Her mother said that her daughter...
1331769258553053184 2020-11-26 09:18:28 +0800 <LeeToland1> HERD IMMUNITY!
1331227176646156289 2020-11-24 21:24:26 +0800 <LeeToland1> While you couldn't see your grandparents one last time or loved ones because of Covid, Sinn Féin were telling us only 25 to a funeral. While people couldn't give their loved ones a final send off, Sinn Féin were attending the Bobby Storey Ard Fhéis (Funeral!)
1331214934273892353 2020-11-24 20:35:47 +0800 <LeeToland1> @MaryLouMcDonald, @PearseDoherty, @PadraigMacL and other Sinn Féin members are LIARS! They said they didn't encourage people to attend the Bobby Storey Ard Fhéis. A new email leaked shows that they gave all the funeral details to thousands of members and supporters  RESIGN NOW!
1331214609190166528 2020-11-24 20:34:30 +0800 <LeeToland1> More corruption coming out from Sinn Féin. They said they didn't encourage people to attend the Bobby Storey Ard Fhéis (Funeral). A new email leaked shows that they gave all the funeral details to thousands of members and supporters. We couldn't attend the funerals of loved ones!
1330983686058225668 2020-11-24 05:16:53 +0800 <LeeToland1> @eimid_ @UKGovtGoogles Tremendous!
1330810773296312320 2020-11-23 17:49:48 +0800 <LeeToland1> @saoirse_mchugh NAW, it can't be and any attempt to do so is WRONG. Beating Dublin in their own backyard is a huge incentive and achievement. Breaking Dublin up weakens that sense of achievement. Hope you understand!
1330807263188176898 2020-11-23 17:35:51 +0800 <LeeToland1> @PatrickSharke13 @rte You know that's absolute crap too!
1330806101009461248 2020-11-23 17:31:14 +0800 <LeeToland1> @PatrickSharke13 Doesn't matter what it is, they're the Propaganda machine of this corrupt Government, telling us what we should be doing!
1330788731394076673 2020-11-23 16:22:13 +0800 <LeeToland1> RTE Fake News out having a Christmas Party, breaking Government "guidelines", yet they're the same Government Propaganda machine that tell us What to do, Where to go and Who to see and we're supposed to believe every word they say? Covid is hoaxical!
1330787577901813760 2020-11-23 16:17:38 +0800 <LeeToland1> @MaddowBlog Still recovering 😂, it's no worse than the common flu and has a 99% survival and recovery rate. Please, spare us the bs!

1329812361104986117 2020-11-20 23:42:28 +0800 <LeeToland1> @eimid_ It's not. Eoghan McDermott started it all off. BBC just didn't start it for the fun. People, well LIBERAL SNOWFLAKES, are going INSANE. The Liberal Left Marxist One World Order Agenda is trying to change the course of time! We wouldn't change Shakespeare's language, so why this?
1329761812418531328 2020-11-20 20:21:36 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Niall_Boylan @labour @hoeyannie While I condemn the exposure of these images, especially the Child Pornography, women go on Only Fans and show naked pictures off to many people. It's available to anyone and they get paid to do it. I'm sick of all men getting tarred with the same brush.
1329758983519956992 2020-11-20 20:10:22 +0800 <LeeToland1> In all fairness, you have a social media "influencer" trying on a new lipstick and they have 5m followers. Someone from United Nations, helping to feed starving children throughout the world has 50,000 followers. One gets mass publicity and the other gets no recognition!
1329758531378163712 2020-11-20 20:08:34 +0800 <LeeToland1> Fake News all started when Sky News went from 1 o'clock and 9 o'clock news etc to News 24 Hours available. It wasn't news they filled, it was all filled with opinions and largely, Fake News!
1329732255124762624 2020-11-20 18:24:09 +0800 <LeeToland1> Will we take 2 on this one? ✌️
1329724089062322176 2020-11-20 17:51:42 +0800 <LeeToland1> Only Fans is available to everyone. It's selling your body for money. It's basically prostitution and then they say "men only use us for our bodies". Give me a break!
1329723351695319040 2020-11-20 17:48:46 +0800 <LeeToland1> Girls are posting nudes for money on Only Fans and then they give out about shite being on the internet. Lol, good one!
1329722859418251265 2020-11-20 17:46:49 +0800 <LeeToland1> Yesterday was International Men's Day too and all you heard about was shite talking about men!
1329712213171396609 2020-11-20 17:04:31 +0800 <LeeToland1> @PmlSlat If your mask works and it's so great, that means I shouldn't have to wear one. STOP FORCING PEOPLE TO WEAR ONE!
1329712027451977730 2020-11-20 17:03:46 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Liz18259935 I do see my numbers going up and down yes. When I do like your posts, they get unliked for some reason also? 🤔
1329710318507921408 2020-11-20 16:56:59 +0800 <LeeToland1> Please don't tar all men with the same brush!

1329577718116179968 2020-11-20 08:10:05 +0800 <LeeToland1> Only took Tony Holohan 8 months to say Visors don't work. Will he cop on now and admit Masks don't work too?
1329554928247902208 2020-11-20 06:39:31 +0800 <LeeToland1> @robertburke84 Keep it up, Robert!
1329554437510193153 2020-11-20 06:37:34 +0800 <LeeToland1> A virus with a 99% survival rate, closing our Country down to the point we cant even do the things we enjoy. Protect the vulnerable? Why cant they protect themselves? If you are afraid of it, stay indoors and let the rest get on with their lives. Simple as that!
1329554102800576514 2020-11-20 06:36:14 +0800 <LeeToland1> Twitter with dopey stories now 😑
1329553562242846723 2020-11-20 06:34:05 +0800 <LeeToland1> What is it about this Mackles ice-cream. Is it a symbol of you having a higher social status or something that people need to put it on their stories all the time. Must be a rule you can't go there without showing everyone. GIMPS!
1329485645094539265 2020-11-20 02:04:13 +0800 <LeeToland1> Happy Men's International Day!

1327976727956615173 2020-11-15 22:08:19 +0800 <LeeToland1> @mickmac12345 Are you stupid? They entered my home, my residence. My privacy. Without permission. That is a crime and they didn't even let me open the door to their knock, they just wandered in and asked for someone who doesn't clearly live here. They then smirked and closed the door!

1327767211646267392 2020-11-15 08:15:46 +0800 <LeeToland1> @CoraQuaid They just said "Ok, sorry" with a smirk and left in their Garda SUV!
1327766343232466944 2020-11-15 08:12:19 +0800 <LeeToland1> @mickmac12345 Are you calling me a liar? They knocked on my door, and as I prepared myself to open the door, I was beaten to it. They opened my front door, entered, and asked was a such and such living here. I advised that they don't live here (The person in question was the former tenant)!
1327753222774251520 2020-11-15 07:20:11 +0800 <LeeToland1> Tonight, the An Garda Siochana decided to come into my home without any permission and without letting me answer my own door. When I responded to say that I was not the person in question they were looking for, they smirked and left. Is this really what our Country has become?
1327701003764977664 2020-11-15 03:52:41 +0800 <LeeToland1> Who agrees with this wide of the mark response. I don't!
1327330443000164355 2020-11-14 03:20:12 +0800 <LeeToland1> Don't ever forget it. We are well on our way and we are going to start to put Irish people FIRST for a change in this Country! #MIGA
1327330073565933569 2020-11-14 03:18:44 +0800 <LeeToland1> Looks as if I've lost a few followers since my comments on the Irish language! Agree or not, who's still with me in our quest to MAKE IRELAND GREAT AGAIN?
1327327196936081408 2020-11-14 03:07:18 +0800 <LeeToland1> @PatOBrienAvalon I think resources and investment should be implemented in better things!
1327327059962699778 2020-11-14 03:06:46 +0800 <LeeToland1> @seaghannn You're wrong!
1327326910603522053 2020-11-14 03:06:10 +0800 <LeeToland1> @TroidMen No, but thanks for the inaccurate comparison!
1327326717304778755 2020-11-14 03:05:24 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Damian81099178 @IrelandsPeace I don't. I'm the opposite infact!
1327326613457997825 2020-11-14 03:04:59 +0800 <LeeToland1> @LoneWol26229585 @TyroneGoldberg3 @DarrenH48555852 Good for you!
1327258626734645248 2020-11-13 22:34:50 +0800 <LeeToland1> @JosephineFitzm1 I think resources should be allocated for other programs in more of a need of resuscitation instead of Irish. That's all!
1327258309167091713 2020-11-13 22:33:34 +0800 <LeeToland1> @DinnyKelly91 @JaydonHeireann Are you referring to the Irish Patriot @NiallMcConnell5?
1327258071396216842 2020-11-13 22:32:38 +0800 <LeeToland1> @JaydonHeireann @DinnyKelly91 Close the borders, look after our own first. Leave the E.U. We take migrants in and we hurt our own in need. Refuse to take them in and the E.U. punish us with penalties, tarrifs and barriers. That's a little thing called Fascism!

1327242491775619077 2020-11-13 21:30:43 +0800 <LeeToland1> @shihtzu44 To speak ignorantly in another language one might not answer!

1327241747106291713 2020-11-13 21:27:46 +0800 <LeeToland1> @DinnyKelly91 @theirishpain Hardly a big number in a population of a 4.5m!

1327241220050055169 2020-11-13 21:25:40 +0800 <LeeToland1> @the__dullahan You just don't "get it"!
1327241048607891457 2020-11-13 21:24:59 +0800 <LeeToland1> @DinnyKelly91 @JaydonHeireann No thank you!
1327240949689364486 2020-11-13 21:24:36 +0800 <LeeToland1> @JaydonHeireann @the__dullahan I'm far from a Liberal. Opposite in fact. Oh, and I'm not a student either. Been there. Done that!
1327240506364092417 2020-11-13 21:22:50 +0800 <LeeToland1> @LuLynzi I wouldn't want to see it die, but there's no point reviving something that's clearly on the way out!
1327240343792852997 2020-11-13 21:22:11 +0800 <LeeToland1> @MmdNu5 @IrelandsPeace I'm not letting it go!
1327240285315854336 2020-11-13 21:21:57 +0800 <LeeToland1> @the__dullahan @JaydonHeireann No, I think we should just have more common sense. For example, some teachers need Irish to teach. There are teachers who can't teach students because they can't teach Irish. They are often better Maths, Geography and Music teachers than these other teachers!
1327239901520293888 2020-11-13 21:20:26 +0800 <LeeToland1> @kfcrazyirish NP would welcome me with open arms!
1327239845329195009 2020-11-13 21:20:12 +0800 <LeeToland1> @flyviz No, I think you're the idiot!
1327232167722713088 2020-11-13 20:49:42 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Vrocialist @OCibhleachain I did, I just don't agree with it!
1327232012109950976 2020-11-13 20:49:05 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Grange09991182 @OCibhleachain True!
1327231982041001984 2020-11-13 20:48:57 +0800 <LeeToland1> @DinnyKelly91 @theirishpain No, I just don't think there's any point in resuscitating a dead language. If people want to learn it and there's appetite, they'll do it themselves!
1327231755980595200 2020-11-13 20:48:04 +0800 <LeeToland1> @DarrenH48555852 I don't know, Darren. I think we can do better than perform resuscitations on this dying language!
1327231472961511427 2020-11-13 20:46:56 +0800 <LeeToland1> @tea_barrys True!
1327231375695548416 2020-11-13 20:46:33 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Vrocialist @OCibhleachain I agree. It's a choice for people who want it and if there's no appetite, why bother trying to revive something that's clearly on a defibrillator!
1327231024565202944 2020-11-13 20:45:09 +0800 <LeeToland1> @LiamK1916 I disagree, Liam!
1327230843656527875 2020-11-13 20:44:26 +0800 <LeeToland1> @jiwooire NO!
1327230637296791554 2020-11-13 20:43:37 +0800 <LeeToland1> We speak English, Mohammed!
1327230231766241283 2020-11-13 20:42:00 +0800 <LeeToland1> @JaydonHeireann Languages that will help us get jobs. Irish won't!
1327230003621351425 2020-11-13 20:41:06 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Miesha6107 Let the students decide. If they want it, they'll choose it. If they don't, they won't and therefore reject that old past. Percent who speak it fluently every day is LOW!
1327229695855882241 2020-11-13 20:39:52 +0800 <LeeToland1> @germooney66 Latin I was just being hypothetical tbh!
1327229576985141248 2020-11-13 20:39:24 +0800 <LeeToland1> @TheExileReturns What are you talking about?
1327229261208580096 2020-11-13 20:38:09 +0800 <LeeToland1> @OCibhleachain Let the people and the students decide. If they don't want it, no point enforcing it onto the people!
1327229079473549312 2020-11-13 20:37:25 +0800 <LeeToland1> @JackD_NP We know it's part of our Culture, Jack. However, let the students and people decide. If there's appetite to keep reviving it, students will pick it. If not, they won't and let that be it. Far more useful things to allocate the resources and investment in!
1327228686580510722 2020-11-13 20:35:52 +0800 <LeeToland1> @irishinmanches1 It's ridiculous!
1327228607689859073 2020-11-13 20:35:33 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Andypandylathe Make it compulsory. Again, if students and people care about it that much, they will choose it. If there's no appetite, no point reviving something that is dead!
1327228397681041411 2020-11-13 20:34:43 +0800 <LeeToland1> @IrelandsPeace We have plenty of passion, but reviving a language as dead as this, when the resources could be put towards something more crucial is more important to me!
1327228135633526786 2020-11-13 20:33:40 +0800 <LeeToland1> @DinnyKelly91 @theirishpain 2 people hardly a mass audience now!
1327030176677568512 2020-11-13 07:27:03 +0800 <LeeToland1> 3 days left. Don't forget to VOTE and have your say!
1327029837786177543 2020-11-13 07:25:43 +0800 <LeeToland1> If I was in charge of the Country, I'd almost abolish the "Irish language". Our language is english, that's what we speak. Make it an elective at school and let the students decide and if there is no appetite and they pick Spanish, Latin etc then that's it. It's a DEAD language!
1326613801530249223 2020-11-12 03:52:32 +0800 <LeeToland1> @mr__daly @fowler_bart Good to see you old buddy!
1326611565299331072 2020-11-12 03:43:39 +0800 <LeeToland1> @mr__daly Hi,  Should be from yesterday or the day before, but you shouldn't have to scroll down too far!
1326560940498821122 2020-11-12 00:22:29 +0800 <LeeToland1> Below, is my original tweet. A poll designed to find out how many of you would take the Covid-19 Vaccine. Made from aborted, foetal tissue. With my below info, please let me know if you would take the Covid-19 Vaccine by voting and leaving a comment. Thanks! LT  https://t.co/bIrL8OgwnH
1326556736656986112 2020-11-12 00:05:46 +0800 <LeeToland1> Vaccines are normally trialled and rolled out after 2 or 3 years. They normally have a 50%-60% effective rate. The Phizer vaccine that they have come up with is being prepared NOW and is at 90% effective rate. This must be some Vaccine! Developed very quickly. It's a NO for me!
1326271869654347780 2020-11-11 05:13:49 +0800 <LeeToland1> They say that the human mind is only using 1% of it's potential. But if you can get a little bit more out of it than the 1%, I think you can pretty much do whatever you wanna do if you have the right ingredients going in!
1326256317862977542 2020-11-11 04:12:01 +0800 <LeeToland1> @eimid_ @KennysKids @mansfieldtownfc More than anyone else too 😂

1326096240862515202 2020-11-10 17:35:56 +0800 <LeeToland1> Donald Trump actually won this Election!
1326096134142619648 2020-11-10 17:35:30 +0800 <LeeToland1> It's starting to look like a crime!
1326096074164101121 2020-11-10 17:35:16 +0800 <LeeToland1> LIBERAL TEARS!
1326095393617276934 2020-11-10 17:32:34 +0800 <LeeToland1> Liberal tears this morning. They're having a meltdown and this is only just the beginning. They're stunned, baffled. Lost for words. They are WORRIED. Think of that and think of what the Mainstream Media are feeling now. It's all getting a little bit interesting, don't you think?
1326094394156519430 2020-11-10 17:28:35 +0800 <LeeToland1> It's all starting to fall apart for the Dems. Looks like CNN of all crowds are recalling Arizona. Nevada now back in play apparently and votes changing to Trump in Wisconsin. If it continues, that gets recalled too. Oh, and Pennsylvania. That got recalled! Donald Trump WON!
1325826609866289153 2020-11-09 23:44:31 +0800 <LeeToland1> @AskPaddyPower Hi,  I'm enquiring as to whether you will be running any bets on whether Voter Fraud will be determined and whether that changed the US Election outcome. Possibly a Supreme Court special Will the Trump Administration win at the Supreme Court and be Elected?
1325821809539870723 2020-11-09 23:25:26 +0800 <LeeToland1> @FnelonMaria1 I agree, Maria!
1325814179769552896 2020-11-09 22:55:07 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Ann89789219 They will, but all the people that speak to me on the street or on the phone tell me they're not taking it Ann. RTE FAKE NEWS will say the opposite of course!
1325813968858980352 2020-11-09 22:54:17 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Liz18259935 I agree Liz, it's all part of the wider way to introduce us into The Great Reset!
1325811578818744322 2020-11-09 22:44:47 +0800 <LeeToland1> Would you take a Covid-19 Vaccine?
1325803665597362177 2020-11-09 22:13:20 +0800 <LeeToland1> Projected does not mean Elected. We have proof and we're coming for Joe Biden and KAMALALALALALALA. Joe really will be sleeping in when he's caught! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
1325800362222247937 2020-11-09 22:00:13 +0800 <LeeToland1> I'm not taking any dopey Vaccine anyway. I don't want autism!
1325737708384358400 2020-11-09 17:51:15 +0800 <LeeToland1> @eimid_ Biden Mail in Ballots being delivered and COUNTED after the deadline. This is not a legitimate victory by any means!
1325737437897887744 2020-11-09 17:50:10 +0800 <LeeToland1> @eimid_ We will accept when we know it's legitimate. This isn't as it stands. Since when do the FAKE NEWS MAINSTREAM MEDIA get to declare the winner? They don't! DEAD PEOPLE VOTED FOR BIDEN. "Glitches" in software changing Trump votes to Biden. Trump votes found in bins and dumpsters....
1325735854292279301 2020-11-09 17:43:53 +0800 <LeeToland1> @eimid_ @AskPaddyPower WRONG. The votes in some states came in PAST THE DEADLINE and they were all for Biden. "Glitches" on software meaning Trump votes tabulated were changed to Biden. DEAD PEOPLE VOTED, such as Joe Frazier. It's beginning to look like a crime!
1325734228814868480 2020-11-09 17:37:25 +0800 <LeeToland1> @eimid_ @AskPaddyPower Why would I cash out a winning bet?
1325729775336509442 2020-11-09 17:19:43 +0800 <LeeToland1> @AskPaddyPower @AskPaddyPower did you see my attached photos? It's impossible for Joe Biden to claw this back. Look at the % reported. They stopped counting and then all of a sudden, Biden leads? His votes came in after the deadline. It's RIGGED. If it's determined fraud, will I get payout???
1325720454087184384 2020-11-09 16:42:41 +0800 <LeeToland1> @AskPaddyPower this is the state of play when I went to bed....  https://t.co/UwaoI5NvBZ
1325720268388577280 2020-11-09 16:41:57 +0800 <LeeToland1> @AskPaddyPower I want my money back. I believe I have won. You didn't pay out. Look at these results. I went to bed CERTAIN I won. Look at the results, there's no way Joe Biden is able to claw this back and this is when they "Stopped the Count" Trump was 1/5 or something!  https://t.co/rmx61jAHZW
1325711582987509761 2020-11-09 16:07:26 +0800 <LeeToland1> @DonnyBr40072043 Well there's so many, like look at the lead in some of those states above and the % Reported and what they are today, I'd say nearly all of them tbh!
1325579358606594052 2020-11-09 07:22:01 +0800 <LeeToland1> @pottyman2 @RalphOellermann I know, I had €50 on him and Cash Out was this. I went to bed fairly confident he'd be re-elected in the morning!  https://t.co/K6Q1XydUv5
1325578883257798661 2020-11-09 07:20:08 +0800 <LeeToland1> Look at the % reported i.e., the amount counted. Some of these states especially, it's not mathematically possible to claw it back for Biden. This is beginning to look like a crime!
1325570266467102720 2020-11-09 06:45:54 +0800 <LeeToland1> Before they stopped the count on Election night....  https://t.co/2eBkFzYWZ5

1325211817577046016 2020-11-08 07:01:33 +0800 <LeeToland1> Trump didn't need two terms. One term Made America Great Again!  https://t.co/DNTTt5QQju

1325146676445798400 2020-11-08 02:42:42 +0800 <LeeToland1> I've had tremendous support and correspondence over the last few days. Thank you all!

1325119081582788609 2020-11-08 00:53:03 +0800 <LeeToland1> CNN don't get to call the election and who the President is. They're not in the Constitution. Let's see the Supreme Court settle this!
1325118751424077825 2020-11-08 00:51:44 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Niall_Boylan He'll be a Yes man. Where Joe Biden put Black people to Jail, Donald Trump put them to work. Where traditional Black colleges were failing under Biden, Trump invested 500bn to Black Colleges!

1325053848508112897 2020-11-07 20:33:50 +0800 <LeeToland1> Thousands of Trump votes found in a Dumpster. Thousands of Biden votes counted after deadlines in many states, including the 8pm one in Pennsylvania. This is ELECTION FRAUD and it is RIGGED!
1324968145568878595 2020-11-07 14:53:17 +0800 <LeeToland1> @AndrewSDavies5 Yes, Donegal indeed!
1324887634813067267 2020-11-07 09:33:22 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Maiziez13 If this is how Politics goes, I'd be plotted and conspired against. Decent people like me, who love their Country and are very Patriotic, wouldn't stand a chance due to the Corruption!
1324881646554914817 2020-11-07 09:09:34 +0800 <LeeToland1> Joe Biden would be a Yes man, boring and a poor President. He'd be reading off the script. At least with Trump, he speaks his mind and commands the stage. Joe Biden couldn't command a stage. Plus, Trump is actually a tremendous President!
1324879117251207169 2020-11-07 08:59:31 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Nogod19Mike Votes were counted when the deadlines were up. Then they kept finding ballots, and low and behold, none of them were for Trump. Seems odd!
1324877712989827073 2020-11-07 08:53:56 +0800 <LeeToland1> Donald Trump consistently lead for 48 HOURS AFTER the Election on November 3rd in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia and Alaska. This is when all the Polls CLOSED. Then Biden mysteriously "found" votes at 4am in the morning and they're still counting votes. RIGGED ELECTION!
1324877464036929536 2020-11-07 08:52:57 +0800 <LeeToland1> You ever notice that you don't hear a single thing now about Coronavirus. Everything is about Joe Biden. I said it would all magically be forgotten about after November 3rd. Covid is nowhere to be seen now!
1324876397676990465 2020-11-07 08:48:42 +0800 <LeeToland1> Donald Trump consistently lead for 48 HOURS AFTER the Election on November 3rd in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia and Alaska.

1324869775647010818 2020-11-07 08:22:24 +0800 <LeeToland1> Donald Trump consistently lead for 48 HOURS AFTER the Election on November 3rd in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia and Alaska. This is when all the Polls CLOSED. This would bring him to 268. 270 is required. Kept "finding" and "counting" more Biden votes then. RIGGED!
1324865924915224576 2020-11-07 08:07:05 +0800 <LeeToland1> Donald Trump had a very high approval rating. He was winning all over the place. Republicans were winning all over the place. He created the greatest economy of all time and LOWEST unemployment. Do you really think they want to trade this for Biden's taxes and socialism? RIGGED!
1324865068169912320 2020-11-07 08:03:41 +0800 <LeeToland1> Donald Trump fought for the People of his Country, and against the Fake News Media, plus the Democrats. There was no "Peaceful Transition of Power" when he won in 2016. Russian Collusion? A Special Counsel? The Impeachment Trial? He kept his promises for 4 years and delivered!
1324861445469843457 2020-11-07 07:49:17 +0800 <LeeToland1> Donald Trump created the greatest economy in the America. He created no new wars. Signed 4 Peace deals and had 4 nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. Much more. Every Republican won in their race for the House Of and retained and almost expanded the Senate. No way Biden "won"!
1324860758614814720 2020-11-07 07:46:34 +0800 <LeeToland1> Donald Trump received more votes than Barack Obama ever did and that's a fact!
1324860666860216320 2020-11-07 07:46:12 +0800 <LeeToland1> @ciaranmcb90 It's worth a try. Hundreds of stories of first hand accounts of seeing ballots being destroyed, sent in for Biden at 4am and extra being delivered past the deadline for certain states. All of these extra votes all seem to go to Biden?
1324858950035050496 2020-11-07 07:39:23 +0800 <LeeToland1> There is tremendous corruption and fraud occurring in these Mail-In Ballots!

1324656956750090241 2020-11-06 18:16:44 +0800 <LeeToland1> Steve Bannon's Twitter and YouTube Account banned because he was on about beheading Democrats? Ok, so why was his banned though and Kathy Griffin's wasn't? She posted a beheaded Donald Trump days after he took office, and his young son had to see that image. Why's she not banned?

1324647608594386947 2020-11-06 17:39:35 +0800 <LeeToland1> QAnon, it's real and it's happening. After all, Trump is out fighting against the Satanic Paedophiles and Joe Biden is the No:1 Satanic Paedophile in the World. He beat No.2 in Bill Clinton and his enabler, Hillary, previously. He's out there fighting for the World! #WWG1WGA
1324515889484582912 2020-11-06 08:56:11 +0800 <LeeToland1> It's called ELECTION DAY, not ELECTION WEEK!

1324459006128279552 2020-11-06 05:10:08 +0800 <LeeToland1> The Republicans picked up seats in the House, beating almost every challenger. They're going to retain the Senate Majority and probably have more than the 52 they had. All of a sudden, their leader "underperformed". Trump definitely beat Biden. Voter Fraud will be exposed!

1324307680882761728 2020-11-05 19:08:50 +0800 <LeeToland1> The Left said play to the end before calling states. So why does Joe Biden get Arizona called for him with 600,000 votes to count and Trump was hundreds of thousands of votes ahead of Georgia and they didn't call it for him? The only standards the Left have are double standards!
1324298383427850241 2020-11-05 18:31:53 +0800 <LeeToland1> Here's actual VIDEO EVIDENCE of Voter Fraud. Is your lego head still in the sand? RIGGED ELECTION!  https://t.co/j3khhSeulc
1324296658717495296 2020-11-05 18:25:02 +0800 <LeeToland1> Listen to this. This is VOTER FRAUD right here. Sound of their voice and accents is enough. THIS IS RIGGED!  https://t.co/LyabXhr8pV

1324290314014699520 2020-11-05 17:59:49 +0800 <LeeToland1> @eimid_ No, Biden CHEATED. This isn't over and we will see it in the Courts!
1324289049549570048 2020-11-05 17:54:48 +0800 <LeeToland1> @sisterquiche Have ye seen yourself love!, go back to your attic!
1324288836021768192 2020-11-05 17:53:57 +0800 <LeeToland1> Trump has three million more votes than he did in 2016. More than Hillary. This is a popular man and a popular President. Someone got their facts wrong this morning!
1324286592299749377 2020-11-05 17:45:02 +0800 <LeeToland1> You're DEAD LOL!
1324284243309174784 2020-11-05 17:35:42 +0800 <LeeToland1> A very popular President, with a great economy once again is about to "lose" to a senile man, who wants to shut down the economy, Lockdown the country, ban fracking and oil, revert to socialised medicine and impose a $4Trillion tax hike, + that's just a small description? RIGGED!
1324283281718808578 2020-11-05 17:31:53 +0800 <LeeToland1> The fact that so many of all these swing states have gone minimally in Biden's favour, in a Country of 300m seems odd. Don't forget, Cats, Dogs and people dead 10 years were getting Mail in Ballots. People were getting ballots for their old and new addresses. This is a RIGGED En!
1324282427288768513 2020-11-05 17:28:29 +0800 <LeeToland1> FRAUDULENT ELECTION!  https://t.co/edd3GaUE44
1324282144940843008 2020-11-05 17:27:21 +0800 <LeeToland1> @OrangeRanger83 Man understands what FRAUD looks like. They're covering for Joe Biden as they know he'll be another Hillary!
1324281103977467906 2020-11-05 17:23:13 +0800 <LeeToland1> Why was Kamala Harris allowed to go to Voter centres and push votes, but Republicans couldn't go to Michigan to keep an eye on the Mail In Ballots? One wants to have a fair and honest Election, the other is RIGGING IT. Go to the Supreme Court!
1324279760088956930 2020-11-05 17:17:53 +0800 <LeeToland1> This election is RIGGED. More people voted in Wisconsin than were registered!
1324277188460531715 2020-11-05 17:07:40 +0800 <LeeToland1> Trump might win the second most votes ever and still not be Elected. RIGGED anyone?
1324277067257622528 2020-11-05 17:07:11 +0800 <LeeToland1> Fox News are getting flack for calling Arizona and there's 600,000 voted left to be counted. Trump doesn't need all of them like, he could well turn that around and keep it Red!
1324276940497440770 2020-11-05 17:06:41 +0800 <LeeToland1> How can they call Arizona so early, but now Georgia still isn't called and he was in the lead by several hundred thousand on Wednesday night. This is farcical. They are trying to "find" more votes for Biden!

1323654801356369920 2020-11-03 23:54:31 +0800 <LeeToland1> @stayathomepeter Sinn Féin stole the money. Are you stupid?
1323654442567217153 2020-11-03 23:53:06 +0800 <LeeToland1> How can you proclaim to be "for the people" and call Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil corrupt when your party stole Covid Business grants during the middle of a pandemic? @griptmedia a full investigation of Sinn Féin accounts must be conducted. Like and RT!
1323654109707280385 2020-11-03 23:51:46 +0800 <LeeToland1> The only thing I'd say that would have made it identical would have been the Covid Business Grants. Perhaps an envelope? All in all, it was a good attempt! @MaryLouMcDonald
1323653712162754560 2020-11-03 23:50:11 +0800 <LeeToland1> What about the Covid 19 Payments that YOUR party stole and tried to hide. Sinn Féin stole this during the midst of a Lockdown and pandemic. How can you proclaim to be "for the people" @PearseDoherty?
1323653352962609154 2020-11-03 23:48:46 +0800 <LeeToland1> What about Sinn Féin stealing the Covid payments during the pandemic? How can you proclaim to be "for the people" @PadraigMacL?
1323652946710663169 2020-11-03 23:47:09 +0800 <LeeToland1> Do you know who else broke the law and committed a serious breach of the law? @sinnfeinireland did. You did @MaryLouMcDonald!
1323651663975112706 2020-11-03 23:42:03 +0800 <LeeToland1> How can you proclaim to be "for the people" and call Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil corrupt when your party stole Covid Business grants during the middle of a pandemic?
1323651142648274946 2020-11-03 23:39:59 +0800 <LeeToland1> Sinn Féin are the most corrupt party in Ireland!
1323651015573458947 2020-11-03 23:39:29 +0800 <LeeToland1> Sinn Féin stole Covid Payments, that were designed to support struggling Businesses throughout the pandemic and Lockdown. How can they say they are for the people?
1323646392749989889 2020-11-03 23:21:06 +0800 <LeeToland1> @AnBabhta That is FAKE NEWS. The most FAKE I've ever read. Get a grip!
1323646091263381505 2020-11-03 23:19:54 +0800 <LeeToland1> @MaryLouMcDonald anything to say?  https://t.co/RXIXFqwNgP
1323638725973258240 2020-11-03 22:50:38 +0800 <LeeToland1> Like and Retweet if there should be a full and thorough investigation into the accounts of the Sinn Féin political party and their leader @MaryLouMcDonald! #SinnFeinStole #CovidGrant #CovidPayments #SinnFeinScandal
1323638278956961794 2020-11-03 22:48:52 +0800 <LeeToland1> @MaryLouMcDonald and Sinn Féin painted themselves as this alternative to FG and FF. That they weren't corrupt and that they were for the people. Sinn Féin are not!, they're in it for themselves. They stole Covid Payments, which were grants for struggling small businesses!
1323637792224792579 2020-11-03 22:46:56 +0800 <LeeToland1> Sinn Féin stole Covid Payments. 10 grand all stolen, which was designed to go to struggling Businesses as a grant for the Lockdown. Resignations aren't enough, they need to be held accountable! They'll unseal the Tuam Babies, but seal up their own record of FRAUD and DECEIT!
1323633627918381056 2020-11-03 22:30:23 +0800 <LeeToland1> @MaryLea29109898 Has to be! 🤣🤣🤣
1323621494723936256 2020-11-03 21:42:10 +0800 <LeeToland1> With everything that's going on in the world, the E.U. have just announced that they are replacing article 171 of the constitution, meaning that OatMilk, SoyaMilk, GoatsMilk etc will now be renamed Oat Drink, Soya Drink and Goats Drink. That's how seriously the EU take things!
1323606071638974464 2020-11-03 20:40:53 +0800 <LeeToland1> @darren_toland @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump His odds are slashed!

1323582884846931968 2020-11-03 19:08:45 +0800 <LeeToland1> For the day that's in it. Let's do this @realDonaldTrump!

1323572256535121920 2020-11-03 18:26:31 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Sk3pticalhipp0 @WayWillu It's trending on Twitter. #TRUMP2020Landside  is literally trending!
1323551860620492800 2020-11-03 17:05:28 +0800 <LeeToland1> Trump apparently has New Hampshire sewn up already. This was seen as a shoe in for Sleepy Joe Biden and he was apparently well in front of him in the polls here. THE POLLS ARE WRONG. It's going to be a #TRUMP2020Landside
1323288281765785601 2020-11-02 23:38:06 +0800 <LeeToland1> @griptmedia You cannot deny the economic and fiscal and foreign policy success of this administration. Anyone else would be a shoe in, but the media and the bookies are hellbent on preventing him again!
1323287831306010626 2020-11-02 23:36:19 +0800 <LeeToland1> @griptmedia It wouldn't happen, they wouldn't tolerate it at all. Macron has shown, like his predecessors, to be very weak with Islamist Extremists!

1322163386797432832 2020-10-30 21:08:10 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Appians_Sapien Sinn Féin are Fascists!
1322163282090885124 2020-10-30 21:07:45 +0800 <LeeToland1> @joerogan50 They are probably here legally and do their fair share and don't scrounge. Fair play. I'm talking about the vast majority that enter Ireland and get a house handed to them after 3 months. How's that fair and we have to wait 12 years?
1322122615281123330 2020-10-30 18:26:09 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Johnnie89623022 @Appians_Sapien I didn't even look at his account in truth 😂
1322115051935928322 2020-10-30 17:56:06 +0800 <LeeToland1> @joerogan50 How are they outdated. Do you know my values or something?
1322112130867408896 2020-10-30 17:44:30 +0800 <LeeToland1> @paddysperch The left, people just like you, are so easily wound up and because of that alone gives me greater satisfaction and appetite for a run!
1322111304195334144 2020-10-30 17:41:13 +0800 <LeeToland1> @HaodhSean Yes!
1322111199862050817 2020-10-30 17:40:48 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Appians_Sapien How would I be running for Fine Gael?
1322111078055186433 2020-10-30 17:40:19 +0800 <LeeToland1> @lobobehan @BernadetteComm1 Sinn Féin preach that they're clean as a whistle and here's evidence that they're not. It's time they are scrutinised!
1322110866704269312 2020-10-30 17:39:28 +0800 <LeeToland1> @joerogan50 Oh and are you a mystic Joe or something? Why do you think that JOE ROGAN!
1321972689041608710 2020-10-30 08:30:24 +0800 <LeeToland1> @WayWillu TBC, may be an existing party. May also be a new party, we've seen how  Aontú done. We on the right can do the same and even better!
1321972372698746880 2020-10-30 08:29:09 +0800 <LeeToland1> @doirebhoy67 A man who is Making America Great Again and a much more prosperous nation. That's what I see. Not 8 years of no accomplishments under Obama and Joe Biden!
1321972076224401409 2020-10-30 08:27:58 +0800 <LeeToland1> @HaodhSean Sinn Féin are untrustworthy. That's the fact!
1321971986034249735 2020-10-30 08:27:37 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Shazam371 They clearly are untrustworthy yes!
1321971713790353408 2020-10-30 08:26:32 +0800 <LeeToland1> @TirChonaill1 Thank you as always man! 💪
1321904785772154886 2020-10-30 04:00:35 +0800 <LeeToland1> @DanStephens88 Thanks Daniel, will do!
1321904518536351747 2020-10-30 03:59:31 +0800 <LeeToland1> @doirebhoy67 Oh so stealing money from struggling small business owners is acceptable now. Is that the new platform Sinn Féin wish to run on?
1321891737401438209 2020-10-30 03:08:44 +0800 <LeeToland1> The reason I am running is because of parties like Sinn Féin. Promising everything, delivering nothing and continuing to neglect the Irish People. Today is the final straw in them taking Covid 19 payments. I'M RUNNING!
1321888879142707205 2020-10-30 02:57:22 +0800 <LeeToland1> In light of today's news, Sinn Féin must never be trusted again!
1321888138340503553 2020-10-30 02:54:26 +0800 <LeeToland1> Wonder is it time for @MaryLouMcDonald, @PearseDoherty and @moneillsf to resign? Surely there's no coming back from this. First #FuneralGate, now this. Pearse Doherty always roaring at FG and FF for being corrupt, well he and MaryLou are corrupt as hell. Throw them out!
1321887665696985097 2020-10-30 02:52:33 +0800 <LeeToland1> Sinn Féin will NEVER, EVER be in power now!
1321887548063518722 2020-10-30 02:52:05 +0800 <LeeToland1> Sinn Féin elected officials received the Covid-19 payment, whilst receiving a large Government salary and a pension!
1321887265145192451 2020-10-30 02:50:58 +0800 <LeeToland1> I really hope the media covers the story about Sinn Féin. They always say FF and FG are bad and don't care, but here's the proof that they're as bad as them. Should be breaking news everywhere. Sinn Féin are fucked now, they will never be electable!
1321885905087537153 2020-10-30 02:45:33 +0800 <LeeToland1> THREE Sinn Féin members have had to resign in disgrace after they were receiving the Covid-19 payment. Their salary and pension wasn't enough. Sinn Féin cannot be trusted and are crooked as hell. This is why nobody should ever trust a thing Sinn Féin ever say. This is terrible!
1321877059333926913 2020-10-30 02:10:24 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Mags755 @sylsmyth Stop living in fear!
1321553745344401408 2020-10-29 04:45:40 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Niall_Boylan Non-Binary is also the biggest pile of shite that has ever been created. There are only TWO GENDERS!
1321553452200329217 2020-10-29 04:44:30 +0800 <LeeToland1> @DeeWall77749076 It's honestly gone beyond disgraceful at this point, Dolores. Our Government don't care about any of it's own citizens.
1321500855300952065 2020-10-29 01:15:30 +0800 <LeeToland1> @kiwigirl2897 Good. Glad to hear it and I'm not in that Liberal infested dump!
1321486953997586433 2020-10-29 00:20:16 +0800 <LeeToland1> Our Government is that stupid they keep Schools (and alot of colleges) open! That's not going to "solve it". We cannot bring it down to Zero, so give up. I haven't seen family and my good friends barely since March. Next opportunity I get, I'm meeting them. Cans anyone?
1321486229788102657 2020-10-29 00:17:23 +0800 <LeeToland1> Schools shouldn't be open. Oh yeah, let students go off and mingle with hundreds of others. Great idea, sure why not. It's not the pubs, it's the schools and the colleges that are opened. Learn online? Anyway, not too worry, coronavirus isn't that deadly and influenza is worse!
1321485393229996032 2020-10-29 00:14:04 +0800 <LeeToland1> @berryluis11 @irishinmanches1 @realDonaldTrump Trump is the saviour of the free world. He can save it!
1321485256889913346 2020-10-29 00:13:31 +0800 <LeeToland1> IF YOU DON'T WANT TO "get coronavirus", STAY IN YOUR FUCKING HOUSE!
1321485137725542400 2020-10-29 00:13:03 +0800 <LeeToland1> Stress and Anxiety will break down people's immune systems, not Coronavirus. Don't let Covid-19 rule your lives!
1321484810230157314 2020-10-29 00:11:45 +0800 <LeeToland1> Let Ireland get back to normal. People are sick to "death" of this Lockdown. We need to get back to our lives and back to normal. DON'T LET COVID DOMINATE YOUR LIVES. If you are afraid, stay indoors. If you are brave, brave it. If you don't want Covid, STAY IN YOUR FUCKING HOUSE!
1321484363217993729 2020-10-29 00:09:58 +0800 <LeeToland1> Masks don't work. They're not proven. Neither Lockdowns, which the WHO said should end. Why are we still doing them? Things must get back to normal, the flu is worse. STOP FEARMONGERING people, it's not that bad. Most recover. If you are afraid, stay at home!
1321484011156475904 2020-10-29 00:08:34 +0800 <LeeToland1> Things are only going to get out of control unless we stop this DEATHLY LOCKDOWN. WHO even said it's nonsense. Look at Sweden? New Zealand done it and what, cases still went like wildfire. Time to end it, before people start ending lives. LET IRELAND LIVE!
1321483525267312641 2020-10-29 00:06:39 +0800 <LeeToland1> Every single suicide as a result of Lockdowns in this Country, that blood, it's on the hands of Micheal Martin, Leo Varadkar (AGAIN!), Stephen Donnelly, Simon Harris (AGAIN!), NPHET, Tony Holohan and Ronan Glynn. They are responsible. This Lockdown must end and right now!
1321483001545531393 2020-10-29 00:04:34 +0800 <LeeToland1> Body of a young woman and two young children found dead in Balinteer in Dublin. A nice area and somewhere I know so well. This Lockdown is having a devastating effect on people's mental health. Yet, here were are clapping hands at mask wearing gobshites? WAKE UP!
1321482044027871234 2020-10-29 00:00:45 +0800 <LeeToland1> Sacha Baron Cohen is a racist to people in Kazakhstan. Oh, he's also a creep! Borat is boring, and a failure. I heard really bad (AWFUL!) reviews! #MAGA
1321475892879728646 2020-10-28 23:36:19 +0800 <LeeToland1> @SachaBaronCohen 4 MORE YEARS of President Trump. 4 more years of PROGRESS 4 MORE YEARS of PROMISE 4 MORE YEARS OF STAYING AWAY FROM THE RADICAL LEFT 4 MORE YEARS OF MORE RESPECT 4 MORE YEARS OF SUCCESS 4 MORE YEARS OF TAX CUTS, JOBS, LESS REGULATIONS, BOOMING ECONOMY, MORE JUDGES. 4 MORE MAGAs!
1321475359200731143 2020-10-28 23:34:12 +0800 <LeeToland1> @SachaBaronCohen So you were interfering in the election. Kazakhstan interfered in the US Election then!

1321473484472672259 2020-10-28 23:26:45 +0800 <LeeToland1> @CaseyPeterJ 4 more years of President Trump, Peter. What ya reckon? 🤪
1321473224157335555 2020-10-28 23:25:43 +0800 <LeeToland1> @eimid_ @CaseyPeterJ would have had the decency and the guts not to sign it!

1321459586533044224 2020-10-28 22:31:31 +0800 <LeeToland1> @irishinmanches1 @realDonaldTrump We need to find it, recover and reclaim it and transform it back to greatness. MAKE IRELAND GREAT AGAIN!
1321450698320609282 2020-10-28 21:56:12 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Niall_Boylan Give him a good skelp and tell him to cop the fuck on!
1321077158954020871 2020-10-27 21:11:53 +0800 <LeeToland1> @RonanMullen Do you still have a part of Human Dignity Alliance?
1320906523938332674 2020-10-27 09:53:51 +0800 <LeeToland1> Third Supreme Court Justice and Two Terms! #TrumpLandslideVictory2020 incoming! He might end up not only beating, but obliterating Sleepy Joe Biden on Election night! #TrumpIsWinning #Trump2020 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #MAGA #FourMoreYears #KeepAmericaGreat #RedWave #ACBDay #SCOTUS
1320904888646307840 2020-10-27 09:47:21 +0800 <LeeToland1> Donald Trump is the President for 4 years, not 3 years. He had the Senate and had every right to appoint #SCOTUS #JudgeAmyConeyBarrett to the bench. Obama didn't have the votes 4 years ago and cannot cry about it. Happy Birthday Hillary Clinton! Congratulations, Mr. President!
1320904017581608965 2020-10-27 09:43:53 +0800 <LeeToland1> Trump has secured a THIRD Supreme Court Justice, a legacy that means Donald Trump will be in the lives of most Americans long after he passes. It's a big victory!, three appointed to the bench in 3.5 years. It's not trending anywhere on FAKE NEWS though? @Twitter @jack
1320902855360958464 2020-10-27 09:39:16 +0800 <LeeToland1> I'm liking and Retweeting stuff and Twitter keep undoing it. You're right, @GeorgePapa19, it's happening to me too. Almost needs to be a "quote" retweet!
1320902137942024195 2020-10-27 09:36:25 +0800 <LeeToland1> The Fake News doesn't want to cover in case it offends someone. Look at France at the moment, it's a disaster!
1320901499120164867 2020-10-27 09:33:53 +0800 <LeeToland1> They don't want to talk about the huge problem going on in France and all over the world at the minute with Radical Islamic Terrorism!
1320899441814110208 2020-10-27 09:25:42 +0800 <LeeToland1> I remember this one very well as I spoke to this man's mother, who was very elderly and upset. This, again, was in Paris!
1320896717974315008 2020-10-27 09:14:53 +0800 <LeeToland1> What's going on in France is a big concern for the world. It's a scary place right now and Macron isn't helping. It's literally a terrorist infested dump at the moment, the amount of terrorists rumoured to be planning attacks is mental!
1320865693609398273 2020-10-27 07:11:36 +0800 <LeeToland1> 2 seasons down and 2 promotions for @ShrimpsOfficial on #FIFA21 #CareerMode. Not a single penny spent, all mostly free transfers and the squad I've had. In the Championship now, and flying near the top! @cstockton94 @kenyon03 @BenPringle1 @liammcalinden @toums20 @ysongoo2
1320734079877304322 2020-10-26 22:28:37 +0800 <LeeToland1> Why is he tweeting like this?
1320534130170449921 2020-10-26 09:14:05 +0800 <LeeToland1> Cunts should piss off with their 3D photos. GIMPS!
1320526411812294663 2020-10-26 08:43:25 +0800 <LeeToland1> If you go back and watch Psycho from 1998, it's uncanny how a young Vince Vaughan looks like @LeoVaradkar!
1320521719560503296 2020-10-26 08:24:46 +0800 <LeeToland1> @RedpillEire @NationalPartyIE @NPMediaIE @PairtiNaisiunta @Oige_Naisiunach @PathfindersIE Ah okay. I think you're right tbf. They could and should do more!
1320521231465091073 2020-10-26 08:22:50 +0800 <LeeToland1> @RedpillEire @NationalPartyIE @NPMediaIE @PairtiNaisiunta @Oige_Naisiunach @PathfindersIE Are you referring to Justin Barrett or myself?
1320406230905606150 2020-10-26 00:45:52 +0800 <LeeToland1> @LoneWol26229585 Good price that too!
1320395702573334534 2020-10-26 00:04:01 +0800 <LeeToland1> @eimid_ @PresidentIRL The latter as they are dopey and brainless!
1320345605114417154 2020-10-25 20:44:57 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Andypandylathe I'm liking it already!
1320341355479130113 2020-10-25 20:28:04 +0800 <LeeToland1> @fionamitchell56 Fiona, you haven't a clue what you're talking about. We will not be wearing masks in 2021 and into 2022. We won't be too toeing around either. It's time we took back our own sovereignty and our own freedom!
1320340612021968904 2020-10-25 20:25:07 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Andypandylathe Do it, Andy. It'll be so worth it. I'd definitely be able to get that amount, and more, signed up to it!
1320332267810660353 2020-10-25 19:51:57 +0800 <LeeToland1> When your own tweets garner more interaction than that of MaryLou McDonald, more likes and retweets + comments, you know Sinn Féin are really in trouble and their end is near!
1320328029214822402 2020-10-25 19:35:07 +0800 <LeeToland1> @MaryLouMcDonald talking about releasing the names of all the babies that died in Septic tanks. Sure she voted for Abortion, she can say nothing. Nothing!
1320307191958614016 2020-10-25 18:12:19 +0800 <LeeToland1> @EoinPoil Brian Cody another classic example too!
1320143422003576832 2020-10-25 07:21:33 +0800 <LeeToland1> @MartinB62957739 What?
1320143341447729152 2020-10-25 07:21:14 +0800 <LeeToland1> We will end this hypocrisy and put Irish citizens FIRST!
1320047793822699520 2020-10-25 01:01:34 +0800 <LeeToland1> @piersmorgan @realDonaldTrump @kathmcfadden they're best buds again!

1319931838379548673 2020-10-24 17:20:48 +0800 <LeeToland1> @audi0288 That early kick off is one bastard too😂, a curse haha!
1319928838181277697 2020-10-24 17:08:52 +0800 <LeeToland1> That's the bets on for Saturday anyway. It'll be met with "That's me done with betting" invariably come 5pm!
1319928252979417089 2020-10-24 17:06:33 +0800 <LeeToland1> Oh Saoirse, go back to the Green Party!

1319917341858287617 2020-10-24 16:23:11 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Alllive08333197 @saoirse_mchugh Who's advocating here?
1319767833170116614 2020-10-24 06:29:06 +0800 <LeeToland1> They are recommending we socially distance and wear masks throughout 2021 and 2022. Not a chance!, and won't be taking any dangerous Vaccine either! Let's start by standing up against this ridiculous Lockdown and senseless depravity that the Globalists have imposed on Ireland!
1319764964949839872 2020-10-24 06:17:42 +0800 <LeeToland1> @unamcnamara Thank you, Una. I will never stop fighting for our GREAT Country!
1319764179646058497 2020-10-24 06:14:35 +0800 <LeeToland1> @PadraigByrne12 @Andypandylathe I don't think Andrew supports Sinn Féin, Pádraig!
1319720401870663680 2020-10-24 03:20:37 +0800 <LeeToland1> @THEOPHILUShaas1 Look at the polls from last night. Trump gets thousands at his rallies, Joe Biden gets like 6 people. COME ON, MAN!
1319708949097177089 2020-10-24 02:35:07 +0800 <LeeToland1> This is what Sinn Féin is all about!  https://t.co/z5lAzfzpBR
1319708776606408706 2020-10-24 02:34:26 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Andypandylathe It's all yet to be determined, but if the right party comes along I'll definitely consider it!
1319708576424824832 2020-10-24 02:33:38 +0800 <LeeToland1> Well this is just crazy, from a crazy man!
1319708379867156481 2020-10-24 02:32:51 +0800 <LeeToland1> @THEOPHILUShaas1 I hope you enjoyed last night's debate, Sleepy Joe Biden got his ass handed to him by President Trump. "I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I thought you did a good job I would have never run." President Trump has done more in 47 months than he in 47yrs!
1319697094450569217 2020-10-24 01:48:00 +0800 <LeeToland1> @DenisCoghlan It's up to us to change it, we have to do it!
1319683446969688065 2020-10-24 00:53:46 +0800 <LeeToland1> @OfEriu @Andypandylathe I will run with you both!
1319671514988482561 2020-10-24 00:06:22 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Andypandylathe It'll have a theme and that common theme will be about putting Ireland FIRST and not the E.U., Syria or anyone else!
1319666870631436288 2020-10-23 23:47:54 +0800 <LeeToland1> @irishinmanches1 That's it, that sums it up. They don't really care about you, if you leave, that's one less to worry about. That's the way the see it!
1319666289464516609 2020-10-23 23:45:36 +0800 <LeeToland1> @IRachelfree I will do all I can and never, ever give up. Our Country is too important to let it be destroyed. I can't sit idly by and let this happen!
1319665883229392897 2020-10-23 23:43:59 +0800 <LeeToland1> @silenced_wont2 It's really treasonous what goes on. Sinn Fein support this too, despite being the "opposition". They are as much to blame!
1319651762719121408 2020-10-23 22:47:52 +0800 <LeeToland1> Asylum Seekers have to wait 3 months on the housing list. Irish citizens have to wait 12 Years. This is the kind of bullshit I'm sick of and that's why I'm running!
1319488956065525760 2020-10-23 12:00:56 +0800 <LeeToland1> I'm still in shock that Biden's closing argument to the voters was that he's ending the Oil industry. I'm actually stunned and just can't believe it! 😂😂😂
1319484606995927040 2020-10-23 11:43:39 +0800 <LeeToland1> 👏👏👋
1319483092101378049 2020-10-23 11:37:38 +0800 <LeeToland1> Pennsylvania is now not in play anymore!
1319481667086635008 2020-10-23 11:31:58 +0800 <LeeToland1> President Trump was cool, calm and collected the votes!
1319479746653278209 2020-10-23 11:24:21 +0800 <LeeToland1> Stress and Anxiety will break down people's immune systems, not Coronavirus. Don't let Covid-19 rule your lives!
1319479645553758209 2020-10-23 11:23:56 +0800 <LeeToland1> Someone in Brazil volunteered to take a shot of what will be a potential Vaccine and they died. Do not take the Vaccine!
1319479220259663872 2020-10-23 11:22:15 +0800 <LeeToland1> The polls are not right. The polls are FAKE. Joe Biden is hiding in his basement, Trump is on the campaign trail going through 5 states a day. He's getting thousands at his rallies. Biden is getting NOBODY. How possibly can it be true that Trump is "losing"? Suppression Polls!
1319478725566697473 2020-10-23 11:20:17 +0800 <LeeToland1> A third Supreme Court Justice to be confirmed and oath to pledge on Monday. That's a landmark and historic accomplishment, which will be significant and will have a long legacy in American life. If you're a betting man, fire your money on Donald Trump. He will win AGAIN!
1319477973716750337 2020-10-23 11:17:18 +0800 <LeeToland1> Record unemployment. Peace deals with Israel,-Bahrain-Saudi Arabia. America respected again. Improved livelihoods for everyone. No war with North Korea. Cleanest emissions in the world. Curbing illegal immigration. Three Supreme Court Justices. Rebuilt Military. TRUMP IS THE MAN!
1319476674896027650 2020-10-23 11:12:08 +0800 <LeeToland1> Donald Trump helped the African-American community more in his first term, than Barack Obama has ever done. Obama was an ATROCIOUS President!
1319476457119354886 2020-10-23 11:11:16 +0800 <LeeToland1> Donald Trump has done more for the black community in 47 months than what Joe Biden has done in 47 years!
1319476286906109952 2020-10-23 11:10:36 +0800 <LeeToland1> Joe Biden said tonight, essentially, that the show is over for Oil in America. Couple that with his BAN ON FRACKING, and he's lost Pennsylvania. He's infact lost the Presidency!
1319475748663627776 2020-10-23 11:08:27 +0800 <LeeToland1> Perhaps why Trump is in office above most other things and why Biden has had two bites at the bait for the Presidency: "Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I thought you did a good job, I would have never run"
1319474568759824384 2020-10-23 11:03:46 +0800 <LeeToland1> Trump done very well tonight, looked calm and assured, and struck the right tone. Biden looked all over the place. You can count Trump in for 4 more years. Go for over 300 Electoral College votes!
1319468815412060162 2020-10-23 10:40:54 +0800 <LeeToland1> Scenes in Dublin today at the anti Lockdown rally are really disgraceful. What happened to people's rights to peacefully protest. Anything said against the state is shunned, just like Nazi Germany. You get punished for speaking out. They protested peacefully!
1319395525721006080 2020-10-23 05:49:41 +0800 <LeeToland1> .... Albeit, by the same accord, if @MlMcNamaraTD was a member of FF, FG or even SF, he'd be expelled by the party whip and gone for being anti Lockdown. At "liddle" Labour though, they'll cling on to whoever they can really!
1319394094871941121 2020-10-23 05:44:00 +0800 <LeeToland1> If @MlMcNamaraTD wasn't a Labour politician, he'd be catapulted up towards the top of the polls. He'll never do well with Labour!
1319393332871766017 2020-10-23 05:40:58 +0800 <LeeToland1> This new retweet thing on @TwitterSupport is bullshit. I want to retweet, I don't want to quote tweet anything!
1319392780003774466 2020-10-23 05:38:46 +0800 <LeeToland1> Am I fuck interested!
1319390296950501376 2020-10-23 05:28:54 +0800 <LeeToland1> @eimid_ Yet he won't go on The Niall Boylan Show. What is Stephen Donnelly afraid of? @Niall_Boylan
1319390126901022720 2020-10-23 05:28:13 +0800 <LeeToland1> @eimid_ Spouting needs fixed hie!
1319389236861296642 2020-10-23 05:24:41 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Patrick77079227 I'll take my chances!
1319386407266357248 2020-10-23 05:13:27 +0800 <LeeToland1> I will never take a Vaccine!
1319342766040748033 2020-10-23 02:20:02 +0800 <LeeToland1> Wtf is this tweet! 😂
1319245103681196032 2020-10-22 19:51:57 +0800 <LeeToland1> @PatrickSharke13 Why are you saying I won't? I will! The only thing stopping me is the FAKE NEWS MAINSTREAM MEDIA and the blockage of alternative ideas and treatments, despite mine being "scientifically" correct. If the HSEZ NPHET etc disagree, do you really think RTE FAKE NEWS will cover me?
1319241876952711169 2020-10-22 19:39:08 +0800 <LeeToland1> I can solve Coronavirus!
1319238953199861767 2020-10-22 19:27:31 +0800 <LeeToland1> I KNOW HOW TO SOLVE CORONAVIRUS AND I COULD SOLVE IT FOR THE WORLD IN 4 WEEKS. VACCINES AREN'T 100% AND YOU CAN STILL GET CORONAVIRUS AFTERWARDS, MILDLY, AND STILL PASS ONTO OTHERS  I'VE NEVER TAKEN A VACCINE IN MY LIFE AND I'M FIT AND HEALTHY. I NEVER WILL TAKE A VACCINE EITHER!
1319225146784292864 2020-10-22 18:32:39 +0800 <LeeToland1> Donald Trump looking sharp and energetic, massive crowds emerging and strong enthusiasm. Joe Biden in contrast with no crowds, looks frail and in trouble. Surely PaddyPower are going to have to rethink about the odds once again? @AskPaddyPower @paddypower #AskPaddy
1319039670689386496 2020-10-22 06:15:38 +0800 <LeeToland1> Where was the lockdown for Swine Flu? Where was the lockdown for Tuberculosis, which killed 1.5 MILLION people last year? There was no lockdown then. This is about as strong as a mild flu and most will recover. Fear, stress and anxiety will break immune systems down. Not Covid!
1319038861503234048 2020-10-22 06:12:25 +0800 <LeeToland1> Stress and Anxiety will break down people's immune systems, not Coronavirus. Don't let Covid-19 rule your lives!
1319038297688150022 2020-10-22 06:10:11 +0800 <LeeToland1> If they asked us to walk backwards to stop Covid, they would. A nation fought for freedom and this is what it has become. We are locking down to "...care for the vulnerable". If our Government really "cared" about the vulnerable, we wouldn't have record homelessness now would we!
1318683756547506179 2020-10-21 06:41:22 +0800 <LeeToland1> @sotcstill @XbossTony Obviously!
1318558269573681154 2020-10-20 22:22:43 +0800 <LeeToland1> @THEOPHILUShaas1 I don't follow the polls no. Just like in 2016, when I didn't follow the polls. Polls are FAKE and mean nothing. The only poll that matters is the Electoral College Poll Tally on November 3rd! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
1318556000291639299 2020-10-20 22:13:42 +0800 <LeeToland1> @THEOPHILUShaas1 I didn't call you a bastard, it's a turn of phrase here. I called you NOSEY really, that was all!
1318550902538723328 2020-10-20 21:53:27 +0800 <LeeToland1> @AskPaddyPower Hi, Well, there was a market for it on the first debate and it was successful. Why not on the third and final debate? #AskPaddyPower
1318550591711383554 2020-10-20 21:52:13 +0800 <LeeToland1> @THEOPHILUShaas1 What's it to you ye nosey bastard?!
1318550031742439424 2020-10-20 21:49:59 +0800 <LeeToland1> @sotcstill @XbossTony Nothing, but we're not quite like them are we?
1318549831183380482 2020-10-20 21:49:11 +0800 <LeeToland1> Hi, @AskPaddyPower/@paddypower Can you provide me with some markets for the US Presidential Election, namely this Thursday's debate? Words/Phrases market if possible. #RequestABet
1318510378855313408 2020-10-20 19:12:25 +0800 <LeeToland1> @XbossTony You're right, Tony. This is what they wanted. What they wanted, they got. They have people panic buying all over the Country again. You'd swear it was Malawi or somewhere like!
1318481591375626240 2020-10-20 17:18:02 +0800 <LeeToland1> Be some wait for a Driving Test after this Covid. Be as well getting this vaccine and contracting autism and getting the free bus pass!
1318455161417814016 2020-10-20 15:33:00 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Red_XIV @EricTrump How do you know what they do?
1318309960120414209 2020-10-20 05:56:02 +0800 <LeeToland1> Schools and creches open still? You could plant a bomb in them and they'd be open the next day!
1318293322612510723 2020-10-20 04:49:55 +0800 <LeeToland1> @uptheDubs10 China are lying!
1318289960596918272 2020-10-20 04:36:33 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Niall_Boylan Feeling like shit tbh. Why are we doing this? The WHO came out and advised against Lockdowns. The rates of infections and mortality rate is really not that bad. Why aren't we doing a Sweden. Mental Health in this Country is going to take a steep descent!
1318288350042783747 2020-10-20 04:30:09 +0800 <LeeToland1> The WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION advised against Lockdowns all over the world now going forward and top doctors and professors have come out and said that Lockdowns don't work. Why tf are we still doing this. Tony Holohan is one wanker and so too are NPHET! #LockdownIreland
1318285476076421121 2020-10-20 04:18:44 +0800 <LeeToland1> Micheal Martin basically said there will be Mental Health assistance to single parents and people living on their own. Does he not think other groups of people that live together struggle with their mental health or what? #LockdownIreland
1318285058889961478 2020-10-20 04:17:05 +0800 <LeeToland1> Construction work essential? There's going to be no money to build anything if he continues the way he's going! #LockdownIreland
1318284959296126976 2020-10-20 04:16:41 +0800 <LeeToland1> Why are schools staying open? This makes ZERO sense! #LockdownIreland
1318284791515590657 2020-10-20 04:16:01 +0800 <LeeToland1> If you are afraid of Covid-19, stay at home. If you are brave, brave it. Let us get on with our lives. Mental Health is at an all time crisis in this Country! #LockdownIreland
1318284654961659905 2020-10-20 04:15:28 +0800 <LeeToland1> HERD IMMUNITY! #LockdownIreland
1318283293821968385 2020-10-20 04:10:04 +0800 <LeeToland1> Why aren't we doing a Sweden?
1318254055345541122 2020-10-20 02:13:53 +0800 <LeeToland1> @LawStudentUSA True and we can't go on like this forever. Now is the time to get on with our lives again!
1318253869152018432 2020-10-20 02:13:09 +0800 <LeeToland1> @LawStudentUSA @edthestatesman @NationalPartyIE A great party and the people in it I respect hugely!

1318233414949101568 2020-10-20 00:51:52 +0800 <LeeToland1> @raveninak What about the Swine Flu. They were a disaster and their Crisis Management team even said that. If Trump didn't do those bans early, there would have been 10 times as many dead. You should be grateful he went against the idiotic scientists, and Fauci. He saved millions of lives!
1318232997070622721 2020-10-20 00:50:12 +0800 <LeeToland1> Barack Obama is the worst President that America has ever had!
1318232448782794752 2020-10-20 00:48:02 +0800 <LeeToland1> @raveninak Two absolute catastrophic fools, who shipped jobs overseas, created more division and more poverty for all Americans. Barack Obama was the worst President America ever had!

1318219178524934145 2020-10-19 23:55:18 +0800 <LeeToland1> @MSNBC @MaddowBlog Just when you think @maddow can't speil any more BS, she outdoes herself again with this one!
1318210816198541312 2020-10-19 23:22:04 +0800 <LeeToland1> @John_K_McGhee Read up about it before taking it. Let everyone make up their own mind. I, personally, won't be taking it. I've never taken a vaccine in my life and that included the Swine Flu. We do need the availability of one though however, so we can open up again and live normal again!
1318204349227671553 2020-10-19 22:56:22 +0800 <LeeToland1> @IrelandsPeace Wow, who are you calling brain dead. Look, take the vaccine, don't take it. I really don't care. However, we DO NEED THE VACCINE if we are going to be able to return to everyday life and normality and get away from this Fascist Government if ours and the E.U.!
1318203935568629760 2020-10-19 22:54:43 +0800 <LeeToland1> @CKelly02003958 Yes, but if we don't get a Vaccine, we'll be bound forever by this Fascist Government and European Union. Let everyone decide whether or not the vaccine is for them and let them way it up. For me, as long as one is available, we can get back to normal and living our lives again!
1318200008273965059 2020-10-19 22:39:07 +0800 <LeeToland1> @IrelandsPeace Correct!
1318172929339904000 2020-10-19 20:51:31 +0800 <LeeToland1> I've little doubt there'll be a vaccine available to most in the early new year, and them dopes in the Dáil will order too few doses or the fridge they store it in will go on the blink or something. There'll be some fuck up or scandal anyway!

1317245444251127808 2020-10-17 07:26:01 +0800 <LeeToland1> 17 days until Trump wins in an absolute LANDSLIDE!
1317097597853667328 2020-10-16 21:38:32 +0800 <LeeToland1> Same people who say they're not a man or woman, well you've got a penis and testicles and male hormones, you're a MAN! You deny Biology, but complain about "us" not listening to scientists. Biology is science folks, are you not listening to them then? THERE ARE ONLY TWO GENDERS!
1317096980770861058 2020-10-16 21:36:05 +0800 <LeeToland1> I bought something the other day online and it asked me was I a Male, a Female or Other. Wtf is OTHER???
1317096757864636416 2020-10-16 21:35:12 +0800 <LeeToland1> The people that I have no time for are the people who hate Trump. Why do you hate him so much and why does it bother you? All you do is watch Mainstream Media and listen to them report negatively. Nobody talks about all the great things he's done, record unemployment etc!
1317095934141005829 2020-10-16 21:31:55 +0800 <LeeToland1> So it's illegal to go to someone's house to visit from tonight, but you can meet a stranger in an outside area or a hotel room. How does that work? @MichealMartinTD @CMOIreland @ronan_glynn @DonnellyStephen @LeoVaradkar @MaryLouMcDonald @MlMcNamaraTD
1317088217435459584 2020-10-16 21:01:16 +0800 <LeeToland1> George Floyd died of Fentanyl, one of the most dangerous drugs going. That's what he died of. He was a criminal and a threat to people. He was a scumbag. Americans are actually rioting because of a scumbag, that's how retarded they are!
1317018745156603904 2020-10-16 16:25:12 +0800 <LeeToland1> In addition, Lester Holt of NBC Nightly News asks questions like "Tell me about Joe Biden as a kid". Whereas, Trump is asked by Savannah Guthrie (also of NBC) to denounce WHITE SUPREMACY again and Q'Anon and whether he believes in it or not. This is the partial, unbiased media!
1317017864440848384 2020-10-16 16:21:42 +0800 <LeeToland1> Interrogation tactics. Trump is given like the most uncomfortable chair they could find. While Biden on the other hand is given a big comfy couch. This is a very small example of how the media treats Trump (hardball) vs Biden (kid gloves).  https://t.co/TFugDQITzC
1317017034773979138 2020-10-16 16:18:24 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Acosta He denounced WHITE SUPREMACY multiple times, you run with your own narrative. You are FAKE NEWS and the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!

1316685637366484992 2020-10-15 18:21:33 +0800 <LeeToland1> @GaryLineker That is a horrid lineup of potential replacements also. Eddie Howe RELEGATED. Sean Dyche RELEGATED. Phil Neville 😂
1316685324978991104 2020-10-15 18:20:18 +0800 <LeeToland1> We need a Government that works for you, not just for themselves!

1316665685733408770 2020-10-15 17:02:16 +0800 <LeeToland1> One is the leading favourite for the Presidency, the other is someone who is "trailing" behind in the polls. Have a look at the crowds, I'll let you make up your own minds!  https://t.co/CUssk4DMkr
1316646529839529988 2020-10-15 15:46:09 +0800 <LeeToland1> @irishinmanches1 @realDonaldTrump Haven't read anything about it, don't think it's real. He's in it too the end!
1316509413331611654 2020-10-15 06:41:18 +0800 <LeeToland1> Enough is enough. Change is badly needed. The "elite" will never do anything good for Ireland, they're all in it together and the political ping-pong is just for the cameras. Leo, An Taoiseach and MaryLou don't give a fuck about the average man, woman or child in Ireland. FACTS!
1316508740561129472 2020-10-15 06:38:37 +0800 <LeeToland1> ... enough is enough. Prisoners are given everything under the sun, such as food, medication, education, rehabilitation etc, but our elderly, who have paid their debt to society, have been left behind, paying the ultimate price in nursing homes and have died on Leo's watch!
1316508063772413960 2020-10-15 06:35:56 +0800 <LeeToland1> ...and out of control. You deem people with terminal illnesses as just people for work. You allow our own homeless to go hungry and die, yet give out millions in foreign aid. You bend over backwards to be politically correct, in fear of offending someone and too scared to say....
1316507326879330304 2020-10-15 06:33:00 +0800 <LeeToland1> Our Government has gone to hell. The cost of living is so high, both parents have to work and don't get to spend time with their children. Retirement age is so high, people work right up until they drop. You are told you cannot discipline your kids, well now most kids are rude...
1316493752270286849 2020-10-15 05:39:04 +0800 <LeeToland1> @ronan_glynn I am sick of you, @DonnellyStephen and Tony Holohan. Absolutely sick and tired of your fearmongering and constant bashing of Irish people. We'll wear our masks yes and social distance where we can possible, but stop telling us what to do and who we can and can't see!
1316387966336618496 2020-10-14 22:38:43 +0800 <LeeToland1> Joe Biden is in trouble. What will he do now? Same as Crooked Hillary's email scandals in 2016. The evidence is there. Will he try to bleach (ACID WASH) them and take hammer to laptops? The FAKE NEWS Media will probably cover for him, like his Dementia, like they always do!
1316384013574180865 2020-10-14 22:23:00 +0800 <LeeToland1> @username777798 You can be part of the comeback, the strength of inner Ireland, to fight back against the elites and WIN!
1316382347592429569 2020-10-14 22:16:23 +0800 <LeeToland1> Mental Health is as serious as it has  ever been in Ireland. Leo Varadkar cut mental health, Mr Burns will do the same. Sinn Fein haven't a clue either. 12 people recently buried in Sligo and 10 were from suicide. Tragic and sad!
1316381239637676032 2020-10-14 22:11:59 +0800 <LeeToland1> @bet365 Coady anyway!
1316380767157710849 2020-10-14 22:10:06 +0800 <LeeToland1> @username777798 You cannot be doubtful, we are the doers, thinkers and believers and TOGETHER, we can change the Ireland we want to live in. Free and prosperous or under the control of a small few, who reward themselves, but forget about others!
1316371676226084865 2020-10-14 21:33:59 +0800 <LeeToland1> @MisterDang @realDonaldTrump If they can protest in person, they can vote in person!
1316347355688562690 2020-10-14 19:57:20 +0800 <LeeToland1> We need a Government that works for us, not just for them!

1316311913459068928 2020-10-14 17:36:30 +0800 <LeeToland1> @JoeBiden Nobody is voting for you, Joe. Not anyone. Nobody attends your rallies and you forgot what state you were in, Romney's first name and said you were a candidate for the Senate, not the Presidency. Face facts, C'MON MAAAAAN. You're done!
1316310679318597632 2020-10-14 17:31:36 +0800 <LeeToland1> @MisterDang @realDonaldTrump How did you vote?
1316170286610501633 2020-10-14 08:13:44 +0800 <LeeToland1> Joe Biden said "I'm a proud Democrat, running for the US Senate", forgot what state he was in and couldn't remember Romney's name (Mitt!). He doesn't know what's going on, he clearly has Dementia or some sort of cognitive decline. Putin, Xi and Kim would have a field day!
1316129367681110018 2020-10-14 05:31:08 +0800 <LeeToland1> What's Oasis' best album? What's the story, Bobby Storey?
1316008092774076416 2020-10-13 21:29:14 +0800 <LeeToland1> ..It's not the lack of investment in houses, it's where they are going. Our homeless figures aren't decreasing because we're giving the homes to the wrong people. We're forgetting about our own. If we focused this all on Irish citizens first, maybe we'd see a decrease in numbers?
1316007650317000706 2020-10-13 21:27:28 +0800 <LeeToland1> While I think it's about time something was done in investing into homes for our homeless crisis and giving students added grant top-ups, this is the same old Fianna Fáil. Borrow Borrow Borrow. They'll land us into the same hole they did in 2008. They'll never change!
1315973685778546692 2020-10-13 19:12:30 +0800 <LeeToland1> @eimid_ Good. We need it. Safe borders is a save Country!
1315973602945257473 2020-10-13 19:12:11 +0800 <LeeToland1> Sinn Fein have some cheek. They'll criticise everyone else, but would like to double everyone's taxes!
1315946220779712512 2020-10-13 17:23:22 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Andypandylathe Oh God now. I'm referring to the 3.3bn investment in Housing

1314181446932877316 2020-10-08 20:30:47 +0800 <LeeToland1> Kamala Harris RUINED by Vice President Pence. She was absolutely destroyed!

1313453607300354048 2020-10-06 20:18:37 +0800 <LeeToland1> @eimid_ Would you adopt the Swedish Model?
1313450902691471361 2020-10-06 20:07:52 +0800 <LeeToland1> It's either the Sweden Model or bust for me. Get the vaccine. Elderly, frontline staff and people with conditions should be vaccinated and the rest of us wait. We get Covid, we get Covid. Fuck the rest, if they get it they get it. We won't have a Country left if we don't!
1313449320730030081 2020-10-06 20:01:35 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Joelong25500334 Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm not for this Lockdown at all. I do feel it was Political points scoring and I do point the finger at Leo Varadkar for the elderly dying and being neglected, but he did hit some fine points against Micheal Martin and NPHET, who people don't trust!
1313443442383618048 2020-10-06 19:38:13 +0800 <LeeToland1> @JosephineFitzm1 Element of that too of course and he loves to play the "game". Wouldn't trust him again albeit as Taoiseach. He did more or less kill the elderly and abandon them!
1313441744005017602 2020-10-06 19:31:28 +0800 <LeeToland1> I don't like Leo Varadkar, but he came out and spoke so scathingly about NPHET. Leo, I will once agree with you!
1313440866187476994 2020-10-06 19:27:59 +0800 <LeeToland1> Joe Biden: “The reason I was able to stay home was because some black woman was able to stock the grocery shelf.” Joe Biden is a WHITE SUPREMACIST!  That's it. That's the tweet.

1312726117778849796 2020-10-04 20:07:50 +0800 <LeeToland1> The selfishness of some people.

1310908474889580544 2020-09-29 19:45:10 +0800 <LeeToland1> @CaseyPeterJ Are you on the night shift tonight and are you in it for the long haul? Big Presidential Debate on at 2am. We'd love to hear your thoughts! #PresidentialDebate #TrumpVsBiden
1310887232937615361 2020-09-29 18:20:46 +0800 <LeeToland1> @BackwoodsmanOf That's not obvious at all😂😂

1310856580129271815 2020-09-29 16:18:57 +0800 <LeeToland1> @BackwoodsmanOf He's the President of the United States, not the E.U.!

1310599833242292226 2020-09-28 23:18:44 +0800 <LeeToland1> @irishinmanches1 He shouldn't even be running no, fact. He doesn't even know what he's running for!
1310599634914549762 2020-09-28 23:17:57 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Elizabe12218417 Are you misinformed or in denial may I ask Lizzie? He closed down travel from China and do you know how many cases were in America at that time? ZERO. Biden said he wouldn't have done that and called it racist and xenophobic. God knows what would have happened if he was there!
1310591944448520198 2020-09-28 22:47:23 +0800 <LeeToland1> @irishinmanches1 Oh he must win and he will win. He'll prevail. There's no way they're looking at Sleepy Joe. He hasn't got a clue where he is!
1310589017667391491 2020-09-28 22:35:46 +0800 <LeeToland1> Looking forward tremendously to the first Presidential Debate between Trump and Biden tomorrow night. Biden, I feel, will get destroyed. He said guns have killed 150 MILLION PEOPLE in USA and he has been in the Senate for 140 YEARS. He's old, frail and isn't mentally fit!

1310531020085755908 2020-09-28 18:45:18 +0800 <LeeToland1> @DaftLimmy @emmetmclaughlin Of course, this story would apparently "leak", just a day before the first Presidential Debate. Just like the October surprise in 2016. Suck it up ye big fat bastard Limmy!
1310530745593671682 2020-09-28 18:44:12 +0800 <LeeToland1> @emmetmclaughlin If you would pay attention to real news and not bs about Taxes, you'd have heard about it!
1310530260476334082 2020-09-28 18:42:17 +0800 <LeeToland1> @emmetmclaughlin If you believe the NY Times. He actually pays millions of taxes, but the fake news won't report it. Just like how this week he gave $500m to the black community and designated the KKK as a terrorist organisation, not Obama. Tax rules in New York were designed by Democrats hunny!
1310529594118856704 2020-09-28 18:39:38 +0800 <LeeToland1> @emmetmclaughlin No, it's because he has given away so much of it and has self funded his candidacy and his presidency!

1310529097806774272 2020-09-28 18:37:40 +0800 <LeeToland1> @emmetmclaughlin He is a great businessman. He's very smart, he's a fabulous self promoter and marketer. He's a self made BILLIONAIRE, who doesn't take his Presidential salary and is someone who's net worth has DECREASED while in office, not like the rest in the Washington SWAMP!

1310508317391941632 2020-09-28 17:15:05 +0800 <LeeToland1> Mr President, thank you. All the way from Ireland. I wish we had someone as strong and brilliant as you @realDonaldTrump
1310508045705924610 2020-09-28 17:14:00 +0800 <LeeToland1> This week alone, Donald Trump has donated $500m to the black community and declared the KKK Organisation as a terrorist organisation. Not Obama. I REPEAT NOT OBAMA. On top of a record setting economy for everyone in America, how could they possibly show him behind in the polls?
1310504085418803200 2020-09-28 16:58:16 +0800 <LeeToland1> Amazing to see so many dolls on Instagram giving fellow dolls happy birthdays and they never barely spoke to them, or even like them really. Have the best day ever, you clearly hate their guts behind closed doors hun!

1309248803883671553 2020-09-25 05:50:14 +0800 <LeeToland1> @gerardwyer Sinn Fein sound like the party that just wishes they were in power. Oh wait....
1309248086817021953 2020-09-25 05:47:23 +0800 <LeeToland1> Sinn Fein the only party where you'll post a tweet and their pathetic wee lunatic supporters will attack you and be very threatening. No hastags or anything used. They look for trouble, just like their pathetic leadership. Their supporters are all NUTCASES!
1309247698885898242 2020-09-25 05:45:50 +0800 <LeeToland1> @DipperMc @cillian32 @DebShoes72 Sounds very threatening. You can't seem to string a sentence together, without using such strong language and rhetoric!
1309247090640523270 2020-09-25 05:43:25 +0800 <LeeToland1> You see, this is what it has become. People get so offended and the left are so sensitive, they make people change their names, businesses and products. The left are CRAZY!
1309246596694061057 2020-09-25 05:41:27 +0800 <LeeToland1> I'm not in any way a UFC fan, but Coby Covington is TREMENDOUS!
1309246277331423233 2020-09-25 05:40:11 +0800 <LeeToland1> @CynthiaHRivas It's China's problem. They are the ones to blame. Stop scapegoating Trump, who went against SCIENCE and Dr. Fauci and carried out the travel ban. Had he not, there would have been millions more!
1309245900519333891 2020-09-25 05:38:41 +0800 <LeeToland1> @CynthiaHRivas Joe Biden wouldn't have closed the Country and there would have been 2 million deaths. You know how many cases of Covid there was in America when Trump banned all travel from China? NONE. When he banned travel from the E.U.? Very few! Joe Biden called it xenophobic!
1309244189431955459 2020-09-25 05:31:53 +0800 <LeeToland1> @POSearcaigh Am I not allowed to retweet anything of interest to me, and to many of my followers? Wouldn't be like the left to try and deny free speech would it?
1309242930700455938 2020-09-25 05:26:53 +0800 <LeeToland1> @cmcoy3971 @DipperMc Only problem I have is the stupidity of our Country and the idiots in it, that haven got a clue. Like you!

1309241983748235265 2020-09-25 05:23:08 +0800 <LeeToland1> @gerardwyer It's true. Sinn Fein are the party of high taxes, late term abortions, crime and funerals they shouldn't attend!

1309105437099335681 2020-09-24 20:20:32 +0800 <LeeToland1> @PatrickSharke13 I'm not saying I'm not a fan. Let's be clear. What I'm saying is why are we not showing adverts for our homelessness crisis as well as these other charities that we seem to all too gladly help. We see them all the time on TV, nothing about the homeless. Nothing!
1309104560464711681 2020-09-24 20:17:03 +0800 <LeeToland1> @emmetmclaughlin That's a different argument sir!
1309051254539259912 2020-09-24 16:45:14 +0800 <LeeToland1> Sick of hearing about BREONNA TAYLOR. Her boyfriend started shooting at police and shot one of them. They fired back, and unfortunately and stupidly, she got caught up in the crossfire. It wasn't intentional as the MSM try to portray it!
1309044112931336192 2020-09-24 16:16:52 +0800 <LeeToland1> A sad sad time and a real disgrace!
1309043238582575104 2020-09-24 16:13:23 +0800 <LeeToland1> @PatrickSharke13 We should be focusing on us for a change and not some other mosquito infested place. What's the point in helping others when we don't help ourselves. It's beyond crazy!

1308908368027934731 2020-09-24 07:17:27 +0800 <LeeToland1> Let's start from scratch, we shouldn't be showing adverts for Trocaire or Concern any longer. It's about time we showed advertisements of our own Country and the crisis we have on our streets with homelessness. IRELAND FIRST!
1308907510364016640 2020-09-24 07:14:03 +0800 <LeeToland1> Our State Broadcaster never stops showing adverts for @trocaire, @Concern and events in Syria. If only they showed adverts of homelessness in Ireland. They would never do that though would they? Such a disgrace!

1308494463405301761 2020-09-23 03:52:45 +0800 <LeeToland1> @kathmcfadden One rule for Sinn Fein and another rule for the rest of us. Sure, what they done was not right, but people couldn't go and see their loved ones be buried, yet SF could do as they bloody well so pleased. It's an actual double standard and it's wrong. Let's not deny this anymore!
1308378498780868609 2020-09-22 20:11:57 +0800 <LeeToland1> @politiceir @banda_ie The same Sinn Fein that said we couldn't attend our loved ones funerals, but they could attend one, and in mass numbers, if they so wished? Sinn Fein should be down 20 points!

1308371039827755008 2020-09-22 19:42:18 +0800 <LeeToland1> Every Sinn Fein member should be sacked for attending that Funeral. END OF STORY!
1308370782381375488 2020-09-22 19:41:17 +0800 <LeeToland1> @emmetmclaughlin There's not a hope in hell also he loses this election. Not a chance Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan are going to vote Biden, who wants to destroy fracking for example. Ohio, which always votes for the winner, is tipped in Trump's favour too. It's going to be a YUGE victory!
1308370285951946752 2020-09-22 19:39:19 +0800 <LeeToland1> @emmetmclaughlin No, while the iron is hot, strike strike strike. Looks to be getting OVERWHELMING support in the Senate. Strong conservative bench now for decades to come, Trump will be in people's lives for the next 25-30 years!

1305420841644158977 2020-09-14 16:19:16 +0800 <LeeToland1> @WildAtlantic55 When we had pride in our People, in our homes, in our towns, villages and cities and most importantly, in our Flag. That's all gone now. The sad reality is, we have forgotten all of our own and that is going to change!

1304458912876433408 2020-09-12 00:36:55 +0800 <LeeToland1> @djoisbosh Is that trademarked?
1304458837676752898 2020-09-12 00:36:37 +0800 <LeeToland1> @fowler_bart Thank you, Bart!. Appreciate it!
1304458759754874880 2020-09-12 00:36:18 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Cc07722914 Undecided yet, but if a few of you have seen my tweets from time to time, you'll know exactly who I dislike!
1304458640968110081 2020-09-12 00:35:50 +0800 <LeeToland1> @dyaknowwhatiju1 I will, you'll be the first to know. Thank you!

1304190452468391936 2020-09-11 06:50:09 +0800 <LeeToland1> I'm entering Politics. It's time to MAKE IRELAND GREAT AGAIN!
1303973163898933248 2020-09-10 16:26:43 +0800 <LeeToland1> @djjohngibbons any word on this Fantasy Football buddy?
1302649662512521219 2020-09-07 00:47:36 +0800 <LeeToland1> @MrJonCryer RATTLED!
1301796755886026752 2020-09-04 16:18:27 +0800 <LeeToland1> @_JMallen True, but you'd swear his blueprint was the only way like 😂
1301640360481951744 2020-09-04 05:56:59 +0800 <LeeToland1> Wasn't a fan of Mick McCarthy commentating on the Ireland game tonight. Decent man and done well with Ireland, but hard to listen to. Kenny tried to play it right, all McCarthy suggested was pump it into the box. Cross cross cross. We are changing, sorry Mick!
1301638957038534657 2020-09-04 05:51:25 +0800 <LeeToland1> If any one of us fell asleep at work once, we'd be in immense trouble. Twice?, and we'd almost certainly be fired. Not Sleepy Eamon Ryan. He earns €100,000 a year. That's how bad it is, our Politicians can't even lie and pretend to stay awake, even when they couldn't care less!  https://t.co/mF9wBiAg3I
1301637001112846339 2020-09-04 05:43:38 +0800 <LeeToland1> Eamon Ryan falling asleep AGAIN, in the middle of Government. He's an absolute disgrace, with no energy. Earns €100,000 a year and he hasn't got the decency to sit on his backside and listen. Ireland really is being laughed at and scoffed at all over the world!
1301636030899118080 2020-09-04 05:39:47 +0800 <LeeToland1> @ClareWithTheHai @EamonRyan @MaryLouMcDonald Let's be honest, she's a boring and uninteresting CUNT, she'd put the sleep to a deep sleep!
1301634415139975169 2020-09-04 05:33:22 +0800 <LeeToland1> @Niall_Boylan No, not at all!
1301483000585162757 2020-09-03 19:31:42 +0800 <LeeToland1> Fuck me @DonnellyStephen is one unlikeable bastard. Constantly on the telly inciting fear and anxiety onto the population, calling it a tipping point. We are not at a tipping point! There has been more deaths by car accidents in the whole of August than Covid-19 since March!
1301482304230109185 2020-09-03 19:28:56 +0800 <LeeToland1> If you wouldn't be so negative and calling it a "TIPPING POINT" 3 times over the last week. We are not at a tipping point, zero deaths in last 11 days, most asymptomatic or mild symptoms. The language you use is the reason 91% have recorded a feeling of anxiety in this Country!
1301133122218622976 2020-09-02 20:21:24 +0800 <LeeToland1> @shaneduffy @emmetmclaughlin BACKWARDS move. PUB LEAGUE!
1301131192352280578 2020-09-02 20:13:44 +0800 <LeeToland1> The very least the Government should do is to open each wet pub up in this Country, once a week. A day of their choice. Then, perhaps, slowly increase that to 2 days, 3 days etc OR have the Pubs opened every few days going forward, without food and "maybe" time limits! @VFIpubs
1301106280241811456 2020-09-02 18:34:45 +0800 <LeeToland1> From the 29th of June, there has been in excess of 25,000 unannounced inspections on Pubs. On meat factories over the past 5 months, there has been 39, with 30 of those being unannounced. You asked me do I think Pubs are being unfairly treated, then yes is my answer! @VFIpubs
1301092722888015872 2020-09-02 17:40:52 +0800 <LeeToland1> If Ireland don't stop this barrage against Pubs, we will lose billions and we will have no money to treat people with conditions other than Covid. The health services will be skint. More misery means suicides will go up, jobs will be lost and poverty will multiply. OPEN THE PUBS!
1301090241462308867 2020-09-02 17:31:01 +0800 <LeeToland1> NPHET!, are a bunch of unelected, uneducated groupthink bunch, who aren't even Medical Experts!!! These people are the ones giving the orders and the Government just lay down. Medical experts have said that we will look back on time and regret locking down! END LOCKDOWN NOW!!!!!!
1301088890250571776 2020-09-02 17:25:39 +0800 <LeeToland1> Ireland is the only Country in the whole of Europe that has its pubs closed. Less stricter lockdowns, such as Sweden, which barely had any restrictions in place, have about the same or less cases and deaths as Ireland. We have only 4 people in ICU in a pop of 5mil. OPEN THE PUBS!
1301088347440451584 2020-09-02 17:23:29 +0800 <LeeToland1> OPEN THE PUBS! @Niall_Boylan

1300945216627765248 2020-09-02 07:54:44 +0800 <LeeToland1> A great and up and coming DJ. Major Harps man also. Gigs all around the County, a few successes so far and has also played at 3Arena. Time to support our local talent on our local radio station! #GetBoshOnHighland @Ivanspowerhour @leegooch @GregHughes2  https://t.co/GM2vQL5TP0

1300718657396510721 2020-09-01 16:54:28 +0800 <LeeToland1> @GameLandAmazing @JoeTalksBack Biden is a real hero? What has Biden done in 47 years, apart from praise members of the KKK and sign the Crime Bill in 1994. Trump, meanwhile, has done more in 3 years than Biden has done in his entirety. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
