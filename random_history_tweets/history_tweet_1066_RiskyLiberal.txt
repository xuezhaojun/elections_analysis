1324497450091106304 2020-11-06 07:42:54 +0800 <RiskyLiberal> Kudos to @NBCNews for going ahead with regularly scheduled election reporting, rather than keeping a camera on an empty WH press room podium waiting for Trump
1324496772773875712 2020-11-06 07:40:13 +0800 <RiskyLiberal> @Acosta Trump not showing up.  Manipulation to keep entirety of evening newscast focused on him, rather than reporting election stories and talking about Biden.
1324496192055771138 2020-11-06 07:37:54 +0800 <RiskyLiberal> @KatieHill4CA Naw. Trump is merely keeping attention on himself, and trying to limit evening newscasts from reporting bad news about him.  This is cheap performance art.  Biden will be president.  This keeps attention on sociopath tantruming Trump world.
1324495641079390208 2020-11-06 07:35:43 +0800 <RiskyLiberal> Trump now delaying coming out as announced at 6:30 pm, because delaying his entrance until 6:55 pm limits media reporting bad news about him.

1312796842556641280 2020-10-05 00:48:52 +0800 <RiskyLiberal> I've figured out that Dr Conley has zero say over Trump's treatment.  He's only the PR doc with the presidential seal on his coat.  Hopefully, real doctors are determining Trump's care.   I need Trump to survive, so he can face felony tax fraud charges in NY in February.

1307368241900257280 2020-09-20 01:17:33 +0800 <RiskyLiberal> Donald Trump isn't an aberration. He's the ultimate Republican. He's everything they want:  Poorly educated. Fake religious piety.  Eager to lie, steal, break laws. The wealthy first above others   Only Republican lament is that Trump is a bit too crude. He says it all out loud.

1307136725588889603 2020-09-19 09:57:35 +0800 <RiskyLiberal> Dear media:  If you're reporting that a Republican senator is refusing to vote on the Federalist Society's third SCOTUS pick until after the election, ask them if that means they will vote to confirm in the second or third week of November üòâ
1307136088595722247 2020-09-19 09:55:03 +0800 <RiskyLiberal> The Republican party has only won the popular vote for president once in the past 28 years:  W Bush's second term.  We haven't lived in a representative democracy in a generation.
1307133671187591171 2020-09-19 09:45:27 +0800 <RiskyLiberal> Democrats refuse to deal effectively with evil and sociopathy, even as it stares them in the face.  Justice Ginsburg isn't even cold yet, yet Mitch McConnell has already publicly announced "F*ck her last public wish", he's getting a third SCOTUS judge.

He was videoed while fleeing, shooting two more men who were attempting to stop him fleeing the murder scene. That hero is dead, the other injured.

As soon as Americans are welcome again outside our borders?  Escape.  Expatriate.  You deserve to live your life in a first-world country. That's why immigrants used to come to the USA. That's gone.

America hasn't been considered a "representative republic or democracy" for years (at best, an, "illiberal democracy").  242 years, a good run.
