1344058459398963201 2020-12-30 07:11:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @American1299 The level and depth of corruption in our government and judiciary is just plain staggering.
1344055621323112448 2020-12-30 07:00:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DonnaWR8 @scott_helmick True?
1344055239662395393 2020-12-30 06:58:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Cuds_1246 @scott_helmick @gatewaypundit So basically she legalized illegal fraudulent votes.
1344055081243615233 2020-12-30 06:57:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LLinWood Just saw her picture and she looks like her sister so I hope the relationship is not physical.
1344054067379630080 2020-12-30 06:53:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ScottyPatriot1 @gatewaypundit Just in our face and we can do nothing about, at lease in court.
1344034833303924736 2020-12-30 05:37:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Hoosiers1986 Our entire gov't is rotten.  I now finally understand #2A.
1344022518944813056 2020-12-30 04:48:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump OMG  A Trump tweet without @twitter taking a shot at it.  Never thought that I'd see that.
1343961833451835392 2020-12-30 00:47:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @nypost I thought that was Michelle.  Thanks for clearing it up.
1343933918110752769 2020-12-29 22:56:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto Yes
1343931565169000448 2020-12-29 22:47:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal Maybe time for the Americans to make their desires know in a way that will be more compelling than the payoffs from China.
1343900607455715329 2020-12-29 20:44:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KLoeffler @SpinePainBegone @foxandfriends Sorry.  Let us know when you will be on @OANN.
1343899963181264903 2020-12-29 20:41:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Real_G2DAZ @9NEWSNANCY If you are 75 and have to work because Social Security does not do it and all your savings were wiped out by medical bills, you get to pay Employment Tax (Social Security) on your earnings and income tax on your Social Security which you (and your employer) paid for.
1343893068819226627 2020-12-29 20:14:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LLinWood It is clear that the Federal Judge never reviewed or considered the evidence.  It is also clear that his conclusion was not based on the evidence and was written before the evidence was recieved.  This is a judiciary up your ass America, you have no say in your government.
1343699510397005826 2020-12-29 07:25:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Kaycecda @realDonaldTrump Yes.
1343682052302901248 2020-12-29 06:15:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @christianllamar @Ajax2847 I am saving my money to contribute in the primaries.
1343681692163166208 2020-12-29 06:14:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RichardGrenell @andy_legault Looks like they are going to have to fly in more votes from China.
1343681500168945664 2020-12-29 06:13:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LLinWood A right that is not enforceable is not a right.  It is an illusion, a lie.  A person who has no standing to enforce his/her rights does not consent to the government that would rule him.  It is coming to the point where the American Government has no legitimate right to govern.
1343677718202777600 2020-12-29 05:58:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gregkellyusa @Twitter Yeah, we need a repeal of Section 230 badly.
1343668336211574785 2020-12-29 05:21:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JoeFreedomLove @gatewaypundit Interesting.  The Police who stand still and watch Antifa assault the helpless elderly has finally moved; on a disabled child.  Police have three choices.  1 Quit 2 Resist 3 Obey "orders" and attack the community.  Looks like number 3 is becoming the choice of many.
1343613290048442373 2020-12-29 01:42:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @pko52 @catturd2 @gatewaypundit The police, under physical and existential attack from the criminal left, has turned against the community that has supported and funded them.  Following the same left's tin pot dictators orders to literally force their neighbors into the streets will not serve well.
1343597195421872139 2020-12-29 00:38:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SpyGateDown @paphotog Apparently the Pakistani gov't was concerned about getting the $ 10,000,000 for gender studies that Pelosi porked into the Covid bill and were just protecting their interests.  PS - Is this true, because if so that is treason.
1343595581583753228 2020-12-29 00:32:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 No biggie.  Didn't Seattle hire a community pimp to fight crime?
1343589698736848898 2020-12-29 00:08:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BugSqueak @NJean777 @Trulyblueyz @X22Report I had Waffles with butter and Maple Syrup and a side of bacon.  If you don't mean "correct me if I am wrong", don't say it.  Do you spend your days yelling at kids to get off of your lawn?  Anyway, admit you were wrong and get on with it.
1343588244412268551 2020-12-29 00:02:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TheHorseClan @MariaSMBII And you thought that the worst thing about Biden is that he is a pedophile who likes to sniff little girls hair
1343573164769509378 2020-12-28 23:02:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal Hey!
1343552703092248577 2020-12-28 21:41:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LikeFineWine63 @wardblackert Don't you need a mind to meld with?
1343552385638047745 2020-12-28 21:40:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NYROYALKING @ressiger1111 What?  Is the covid vaccine really a reintroduction of Thalidomide?
1343551837144694785 2020-12-28 21:38:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @seanhannity @willbarrett_1 Doesn't matter, the MSM will report him to be a Trump supporter.
1343551673109647368 2020-12-28 21:37:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tbone9070 @hrkbenowen True.  Parler is very poor technically.  It is that which keeps people from moving over for good.
1343549135274745856 2020-12-28 21:27:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WizAmyGreen @sallie__anne Does this mean that the @FBI is lying to us?  Who would believe that?  But one would have to ask if the RV that blew is not the Warner RV, where is it?  Remember, when the FBI is involved, the American people will never hear the truth or have any idea what really happened.
1343547181450448898 2020-12-28 21:19:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BugSqueak @NJean777 @Trulyblueyz @X22Report I believe the quoted part is the ruling and the part that starts -Section 98 therefore- is a modern interpretation.  Easy enough to check what the ruling says before spewing crap.
1343545935423447040 2020-12-28 21:14:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NJean777 @X22Report Every cop in America needs to read this and consider it before they go out to enforce Marxist tin pot dictators dictates to the harm of their communities and the people therein.
1343542979647029248 2020-12-28 21:03:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @QPatriot0 @GeneMcVay @restartleader WTF?  What bomb?
1343539812490309632 2020-12-28 20:50:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JewishVoice You may have named yourself the Jewish Voice, but nothing can be farther from the truth.  You do not speak for the Jewish people.  Just another leftist organization pretending legitimacy.  NEVER AGAIN.
1343538815709794304 2020-12-28 20:46:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @17cmkelly Read this.  Scary and very possible.
1343537179188858881 2020-12-28 20:39:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @willchamberlain The only problem is that Trump did not lose the election.  Property &amp; rights that are stolen/fraudlently obtained do not become that of the crook &amp; one does not lose ownership &amp; rights because of the theft.  How would a Marxist brain dead China owned Pres be good for the country?
1343372793220460546 2020-12-28 09:46:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal Hard to believe that @DougDucey sold that to China.

1343269875922259969 2020-12-28 02:57:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Solmemes1 Nice rig.  What are the specs?  DS builds a good gaming computer but tends to be overpriced (IMO).
1343250746951696390 2020-12-28 01:41:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lilBee67569241 Is California a Red State?  There is so much Democrat Election Fraud, we will never know.

1343248524356415489 2020-12-28 01:32:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GoodVsEvil17 So I guess the rumors are true, Clinton had sex with at least one consenting adult.
1343239815462961152 2020-12-28 00:58:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @USAloveGOD @CRRJA5 Of course, illegal aliens are exempt from any of the possible punishments cited above.
1343239462487085056 2020-12-28 00:56:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DavidakaWyatt @KentuckyGoddess Disagree, no reason to let yourself be a punching bag and waiting for the evil to get tired and go after someone else.  Fighting back with everything you have is the only way to stop bullies.
1343238916254519297 2020-12-28 00:54:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CarloVKag Yeah, but only one is good enough to wipe your a$$ with.
1343238659101794306 2020-12-28 00:53:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JodyBelcher7 @gailsline Do a clean bill and Trump will sign it in a heart beat.  Blackmailing America and blaming it on the prime victim of Democrat Corruption is what we are seeing here.  Anyone remember when they use to respect @Reuters ?

1343225345520988160 2020-12-28 00:00:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @wmmII88 PS - In stead of fighting the fraud against his own party's Senatorial Candidates, why is McConnell attacking the president and demanding he stick his butt up in the air?
1343225048056795136 2020-12-27 23:59:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @wmmII88 McSally won in Arizona. That is the tweet.
1343224854175076352 2020-12-27 23:58:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kylegriffin1 Tired of your shit, leftist shill  Pelosi blackmailed the President with American lives and well being at stake to get everything from Pakistani sex stuff to a billion for Sudan to more money for the Kennedy Center to raises for herself and co-criminals in the House.  He said no.
1343219900609806340 2020-12-27 23:39:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @laurenboebert @USJusticeNow 👏👏👏👏👏
1343218796417359872 2020-12-27 23:34:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @newsmax Phuck McConnell and the #CCP horse he road in on.  He has zero credibility.
1343217944902266886 2020-12-27 23:31:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GeorgePapa19 @samyky588893 Truth.  Our government governs with the consent of the people.  A government of fraud and corruption cannot exist long.  We will end up with a totalitarian Marxist dictatorship and be ruled by force like China, Cuba, Venezuela, etc. or in a civil war.
1343214231269740546 2020-12-27 23:16:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KentuckyGoddess Anyone looking for quality employees?
1343192946368151552 2020-12-27 21:52:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WendyRogersAZ @debrand1827 You mean that Arizona did not actually elect gun grabbing Omar loving China Kelly or brain addled corrupt pedo Biden?  Well I'll be.  Seriously, Arizona is as red as they come, I know because I am a resident.  The massive Democrat Election Fraud supported by @dougducey is amazing
1343192099722678273 2020-12-27 21:48:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LLinWood Addressing your PS.  The law is meaningless in the United States, particularly in relation to massive Democrat crimes.
1343191589955411969 2020-12-27 21:46:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Grhm_i @Love_Chihuahua True?  I guess we will see on Monday.

1343189548784734208 2020-12-27 21:38:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AZGOP @PossDoug Sounds like you are going to block half of @twitter.
1343188111216443392 2020-12-27 21:32:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @barmore27 @Sundncefn I never was a Republican.  I am a Trump supporter and supported Republicans because they were not as bad as the Democrats (marginally).  The election and Republican support of Democrat Election Fraud (Ducey, Kemp, McConnell, Romney, .....) has made me hold the Party in contempt.
1343187359160913923 2020-12-27 21:29:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KentuckyGoddess So sorry.  What does your husband do?  Maybe someone who is hiring will see your answer.
1342994979484884992 2020-12-27 08:45:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LLinWood The @FBI is now checking for garage pulls.

1342977891416436736 2020-12-27 07:37:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HalseyXT On the other hand, how many people has the @FBI accused of crimes that were completely innocent?  So I would not get to excited yet.
1342975666208219136 2020-12-27 07:28:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dbongino @LyleAnderson3 Sorry, it is the cops.  They are the ones "following orders" and "putting food on their kids tables" while the community dies because they are enforcing dictates of tin pot dictators.  And before this crap, I was 100% pro police.

1342971527810097152 2020-12-27 07:12:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @may_talcott Phuck Biden and the Chinese horse he road in on.  Massive Election Fraud does not give the right to demand to the corrupt perp.

1342565461066563584 2020-12-26 04:18:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ahomeforlayla @POTUS Are you talking about the package that Pelosi held up since October for greed and political purposes?  Or is it the pure bill to provide help for Americans that Pelosi deep sixed?  Democrats lie, people die.
1342564704829415424 2020-12-26 04:15:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ScottPresler I bet he did not say that the bombing of his city was "No laughing matter".
1342562418958864385 2020-12-26 04:06:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @stewonthis1 @FBI I am waiting for breaking news to tell us they found a garage pull.  Yeah, the @FBI likely has its evidence destruct unit on the scene.
1342562067870482432 2020-12-26 04:05:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @443777 @newsmax I guess they were disappointed in the amount Pelosi allocated for sex studies in Pakistan.
1342560742055182336 2020-12-26 03:59:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BrianKempGA You are a phucking hypocrite.  Disgusting use of human meat.  You sell out your State, your people, your country, and your president and you call on Christ in love.  I hope there is a nice hot pit in hell for you.
1342517036216303616 2020-12-26 01:06:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RBruceAllRighty Don't fret, the Supreme Court has planned a review of the massive Democrat Election Fraud in PA to start two days after the presidential inauguration.
1342515852415959041 2020-12-26 01:01:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @me_think_free What about the weeds that are strangling them.
1342515544717545472 2020-12-26 01:00:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SexCounseling @Anzers Biden did not win. Kelly did not win.  The people of Arizona (I am one) were defrauded and disenfranchised by their state government.  What can we do about it?
1342514626609651713 2020-12-26 00:56:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RepSusieLee There you go, relief for Americans.
1342514020394303488 2020-12-26 00:54:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lukeobxx A warning from Antifa / BLM to shut up and bend over or else?
1342513389545779200 2020-12-26 00:51:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @reubing @ChrisRuddyNMX @newsmax @OANN
1342280777183100929 2020-12-25 09:27:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MelissaRNMBA @may_talcott What justice.  So the Supreme Court comes to the conclusion that Biden was frauduentl elected.  Then what?
1342223017762463744 2020-12-25 05:37:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ScottyPatriot1 On behalf of my self and my family we wish the Trump family a wonderous Chistmas and a happy New Year.  Best to you who have worked so hard for all of us and for our loved country.  In this year of spreading evil, you have been a shining light to gather around.
1342220905850699776 2020-12-25 05:29:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EvanAKilgore No.  A scummier bunch were never seen.
1342189484301946880 2020-12-25 03:24:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Prosperous1776 @SAndricsak Not sure that is true.  I believe the Pennsylvania case is scheduled to be heard after Biden is sworn into office.  It will be something when Trump is sworn in &amp; then the court deigns to hear some cases.  The Supreme Court is useless garbage without a reason for existing.
1342188194008158208 2020-12-25 03:19:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal Maybe revenue from China will replace some of the losses Hollywood will experience because it despises America and holds us in contempt.
1342099400621867009 2020-12-24 21:26:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GLFOP @Blackflame5151 @realDonaldTrump @stephanie_mohr Agree.  I would recommend that you urge your members to not "follow orders" of tin pot dictators that are blatently illegal and attack their own communities.  Example, Oregon last week.
1342098173641146370 2020-12-24 21:21:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JakeMc945 And yet, as we have seen recently in Oregon, when the people clash with government in an attempt to obtain fair and honest and transparent governance, it is the government that sends out the armored swat teams to attack the people.  Sadly, the cops "follow orders"
1342096457529085952 2020-12-24 21:15:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @8richard6 @PaulStout10 As I understand, the Roberts plan is to swear Biden in as President and then return to Scotus to hear arguments about massive Democrat Election Fraud in Pennsylvania, and then rule that it is to late to do anything about it.
1342095479249666048 2020-12-24 21:11:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @liquidlaugh @ckolacia Based on what we have seen putting a spot light on the massive Democrat Election Fraud, does it matter?
1342095043000037378 2020-12-24 21:09:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FreedomCh1776 @Lamed_Vav How do you know her mom is not a POS too?

1342087734974791680 2020-12-24 20:40:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JennaEllisEsq What Constitution?  What law?  Not sure that I am seeing much of either
1341941842582020097 2020-12-24 11:00:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RepAdamSchiff Bull  Shit
1341918112438894592 2020-12-24 09:26:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @hrkbenowen Not sure, but I think I can come within a decade.
1341865907472064512 2020-12-24 05:58:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @liquidlaugh I don't know, we get a lot of money from China.  All earmarked to elected officials of course, but it is money to us.
1341854907435896832 2020-12-24 05:15:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BarnettforAZ I vote for jail, but none of our votes count in Arizona.
1341854371340902400 2020-12-24 05:13:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @hrkbenowen @MarthaVineyard4 At her rate, a few ice cream sandwiches.
1341854251560013824 2020-12-24 05:12:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CindyKendrick11 @KimInTulsa @realDonaldTrump I agree, but would remind everyone that our officials in DC (how many legally elected and not fraudlently installed?) have plenty more shit for us Americans.
1341853806242398210 2020-12-24 05:10:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal Throw their sorry asses in jail, where people who defraud their constituents belong.
1341848601668960256 2020-12-24 04:50:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wizard_Predicts @TrumpFanNevada Kemp can always move to China and live off of its gratitude.
1341847736736366593 2020-12-24 04:46:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec Wow, that's more people that voted (honestly and alive) for Biden.
1341845537167867904 2020-12-24 04:38:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @liquidlaugh Does it matter?  The way elections are run in the US the winner is not the person who gets the votes but the criminal who controls the counting and verification process.
1341842309847998464 2020-12-24 04:25:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jeweltyme @hrkbenowen @sukimoto1000 How can that be?  He forgot what that means twelve seconds after saying it.
1341839979593363456 2020-12-24 04:15:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MattBraynard Run @GovKemp run.
1341801564483153920 2020-12-24 01:43:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TucsonZia @zeusFanHouse 80 million, in your dreams.
1341800165259145216 2020-12-24 01:37:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ICEgov @AU_bebe Isn't he on Biden's transition committee?  I am not positive.  Maybe I have him mixed up with another Venezuelan Drug Dealer.
1341745320493891587 2020-12-23 21:59:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit @bindyb123 @CassandraRules Oops, time to jiggle the Dominion Algorithm a little more and get some more blank ballots in from China.
1341744759996444672 2020-12-23 21:57:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @red_red_rita @madepilita @realDonaldTrump Trump wins WI.  So now what happens to its illegally confirmed Electors?
1341744443917910017 2020-12-23 21:56:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ByronYork @HotlineJosh What phucking planet are you living on?  Less people want him than wanted Biden and there were not many of them (speaking of honest votes by real living citizens counted honestly as well).
1341744040526499843 2020-12-23 21:54:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dbongino Bye.
1341743737911668736 2020-12-23 21:53:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tpdeod32 Me too.
1341742692909211648 2020-12-23 21:49:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit The next step will be to yank China Kelly out of the Senate, he clearly won by fraud.  Arizona is not a Marxist gun confiscating China sucking state.  Once that is done, a criminal investigation of @dougducey is in order.
1341741343941382145 2020-12-23 21:43:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AZGOP @webetterbelieve As a resident of Maricopa County, I say jail the phuckers.
1341740191254376448 2020-12-23 21:39:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @newsmax @stinchfield1776 Is this the @newsmax that did the long piece on how honest Dominion is and no proof of election Fraud there?  That ened me, @OANN.
1341739569377505284 2020-12-23 21:36:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @IminHisbook @andy_legault @gatewaypundit Considering that a number of states have criminally violated the Constitution to enable election fraud and that the Supreme Court has abdicated its role in defending it, "within the Constitution" may be a useless approach doomed to fail.
1341738648413224960 2020-12-23 21:33:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LeahR77 @RosarioReynos10 Congress is totally corrupt on both sides of the aisle.  Yes there are a few good ones, but you can count them on your hands and feet and still have toes left over.  One starts to wonder how many of them were elected by election fraud and not honestly.
1341558729976676353 2020-12-23 09:38:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @anonpatriotq @MoooPapa History is wonderful, just not for the people who have to live through it.
1341558266426347520 2020-12-23 09:36:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LindseyGrahamSC Year, I am going to buy some toilet paper to get me through the next few months.
1341558109760700417 2020-12-23 09:35:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LindseyGrahamSC Where will the bill save jobs and lives;  Sudan, Egypt, Venezuela, in the basement of the Kennedy Center, where?  Just cut the shit.  Congress sucks.  Besides, how do you know?  Did you read the bill and have even an inkling what is in it?
1341557464588713984 2020-12-23 09:33:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EvanAKilgore NO!

1341527703036391425 2020-12-23 07:35:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @disclosetv Good.
1341527642353254400 2020-12-23 07:34:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RyanAFournier The worst part is that the entire election system is rigged and it does not matter who the American people vote for in the primaries to get a good candidate and in the election to get him/her elected.  How long can a country survive this before either dictatorship or civil war?
1341525793692737536 2020-12-23 07:27:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @george_revere @JackySinAZ Wow, with talent like Donna, &amp; Geraldo &amp; Juan &amp; Wallace it is hard to believe that @Foxnews has fallen so much.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

1341400347168935942 2020-12-22 23:08:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RichardGrenell The sad thing we just learned is that it does not matter who we vote for because our votes don't count and our votes are not counted.
1341399163091750916 2020-12-22 23:04:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Swamp_Fox17 @lightning989 @senatemajldr Is the Asia Reassurance Initiative, whatever the puck that is, connected to Mitch's wife Chinese family?

1341398532239011843 2020-12-22 23:01:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit "...and they don’t know how to turn it around...."  My suggestion is to put together a committee with Ryan, Juan, Geraldo, and Donna all run by Wallace and get ideas on how to make @FoxNews great again.  Maybe they can lure some talent over from @CNN.
1341397118385352705 2020-12-22 22:56:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @perfectsliders Failed Republic run by the #CCP.  Starting to look like that.

1341387143650762753 2020-12-22 22:16:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 You can't, they control the vote count.
1341387002545991680 2020-12-22 22:15:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Mimitraki @thechief1962 For those who are calling for Trump to veto, look at the Nays, 6 of them.  Any veto will be overridden.  So America is screwed by its congress and there is nothing the people who they supposedly represent can do about it.
1341372557841199109 2020-12-22 21:18:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @IndianaMAGAMike @BarryRChapman Congress will override the veto, look at the vote to enact and then the MSM will crucify him for not caring about the American people.
1341372272913776647 2020-12-22 21:17:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CodeMonkeyZ @MariaSMBII @SidneyPowell1 No and no.  She is to valuable and engaged in overcoming the massive Democrat Election Fraud to be side track as a special counsel.  Also, there is not enough time to convene a grand jury and have indictments issued by January 6.
1341371005328007168 2020-12-22 21:12:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bretvv @learning2fly6 It is the law.
1341369810127446021 2020-12-22 21:07:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CKRManagement @TrumpLadyFran @realDonaldTrump When you buy politicians, $ 3B dollars is a return on investment.
1341368879927324672 2020-12-22 21:03:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LadyRedWave @realDonaldTrump He won't because there are enough votes in congress to override him.  America has two choices -  Democrat - Steaming pile of 💩, or  Republican - fly ridden rotting pile of garbage.  In other words, with the corrupt money driven system, the people of America have no chance.
1341365720177766400 2020-12-22 20:51:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Prosperous1776 @LionTedPride Sorry no.  Roberts was a sell out scumbag long before Trump came along.  He is a Bush guy that may be comprimised.
1341364554513567744 2020-12-22 20:46:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JohnCornyn @13thGenPatriot Now tell us what a hard year this has been for the Sudan, Egypt, the Kennedy Center and the like.  $ 600 does not mean shit to locked down desparate people.
1341360888675090432 2020-12-22 20:32:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @liquidlaugh How much of the funding ends up going to the Democrats?
1341360432645214210 2020-12-22 20:30:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SpeakerPelosi Bull shit.
1341358692944396290 2020-12-22 20:23:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @senatemajldr Bull Shit   It is a great give away of tax dollars to overseas and special interests so that desperate Americans can get a pittance.  Kick backs to congress bought with our pain.
1341184238469574658 2020-12-22 08:50:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @pvtjokerus Is that the police or a bunch of Nazi swat men in the picture?
1341180836331225088 2020-12-22 08:36:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BardsFM @Sundncefn Well, they just committed suicide.

1341141731438313472 2020-12-22 06:01:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MajorPatriot @blitzntj1976 Agree.

1341139837458337792 2020-12-22 05:53:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HighNotePatriot @realDonaldTrump GERADO is a moron.  Joe Biden did not win the election, he committed massive fraud and disenfranchised millions of Americans so that he could claim the WH.    Trump overwhelmingly won the election.  How can a Constitution that is violated bind a soverign state?  I'm with Ward.
1341137164931776512 2020-12-22 05:43:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RepCloudTX @williamlharbuck Vote against it.  Congress members need to read what they are voting on before they insert it into American's back ends.
1341136452852219905 2020-12-22 05:40:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SheepDogSociety @StarvinLarry Who is outraged.    Antifa? BLM? Karen? @CNN lying heads? Democrats?  Who?  It may be the truth.
1341135993546579968 2020-12-22 05:38:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @senatemajldr @DanaPerino @FoxNews Saw that Sudan is getting a ton of money among other countries no one gives a fuck about and the Kennedy Center is getting more of my taxes.  Good job Mitch, you really put it to Pelosi.
1341135436060581888 2020-12-22 05:36:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jonidunnLKN @marsha9753 @docdhj @OANN @Lrihendry @OANN for me.  I like @Newsmax to a degree, but as @Foxnews works to become more like @CNN, Newsmax is starting to become Fox News.  Not great.
1341134248976084993 2020-12-22 05:31:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AOC @RHamblock Wow, where did that come from?  Truth.
1341133679054127104 2020-12-22 05:29:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jmjpainter @charliekirk11 The Democrat Party should adopt the new motto, "Up yours and there is nothing you can do about it".
1341133019034238976 2020-12-22 05:26:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wizard_Predicts @Jouse79 So by certifying the result, @GovKemp committed a criminal act.  At this point will he compound it by not withdrawing his certification?
1341051419940425729 2020-12-22 00:02:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BlessUSA45 @MOPARPISTOLGRIP Cops are destroying what little public support they have left by such behavior.
1341005751867740161 2020-12-21 21:01:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @donna_iago @jennfranconews @OANN I recommend that you and your 14 followers, other fake accounts, not make a donation.  Block.
1341005404193443842 2020-12-21 20:59:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jennfranconews @dpretto33RTM The Supreme Court will rule that Trump has no standing in the Presidential Election and that the enormous amount of proof of election fraud need not be heard.
1341001787642314755 2020-12-21 20:45:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @simex @CodeMonkeyZ Agreed.  The Supreme Court, in the decision to not even hear Texas, did much to destroy the Constittuion and to make every soverign state question whether they are bound by its terms.  Any contract that can be criminally violated with impunity is worthless &amp; not binding.
1341000720221261824 2020-12-21 20:41:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JohnCornyn Somehow I think the country would be all the better if Congress shut down for a long while.
1340999229867585536 2020-12-21 20:35:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump ! This claim about election fraud is disputed by the Criminal Democrats that committed it.  ! This claim about election fraud is overwhemingly supported by evidenced from multiple sources.  Hey @twitter, fixed it.
1340764458369470464 2020-12-21 05:02:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @8Revolt @realDonaldTrump But, but, but the head of the Army (who serves at Trump's pleasure) said that is a no no.
1340763969506557952 2020-12-21 05:00:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SheldonRothMD1 @EileenTownsend4 Yeah, enjoy your Christmas big time this year.  If Biden takes control as a proxy for China and the Marxists reign supreme, the may be your last one.
1340763089340231680 2020-12-21 04:56:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mpukita I would love to see that.
1340761623347122176 2020-12-21 04:50:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @propatriots @w_terrence The Republicans will not take the House in 2022.  By then every election district will be run by Marxist Democrats and every vote counted on a Dominion machine and the 30,000,000 new illegals will be voting.
1340761101567344640 2020-12-21 04:48:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @w_terrence Election Fraud
1340760958340194306 2020-12-21 04:48:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden And let me guess.  You will order them from China through Hunter's new medical supply company.
1340734928120471552 2020-12-21 03:04:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @reubing Easy.  https://t.co/fjZN86mB64
1340715421805101056 2020-12-21 01:47:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LyleAnderson3 @ChuckCallesto @13hammers Clearly Trump won Arizona by a huge margin and McSally beat China Kelly.  My vote was trashed by @DougDucey and hence men an I resent it terribly.  Ducey sold us out to China and made us all dirty.
1340714876667215872 2020-12-21 01:45:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Love4Alberta I am blocking you because you are an asshole.  Take that grammar and insert it.
1340714609104207872 2020-12-21 01:44:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Love4Alberta Yes.  It has allied with China and Soros and his ilk, the pure evil, to subjugate and then destroy America.
1340713188556328960 2020-12-21 01:38:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @scott_kerr @BeanK511 Japan is a truly wonderful country with amazing people.
1340693602930868226 2020-12-21 00:20:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TwelvesOaks The conclusion is that no matter where they went, there were 13,000,000 more votes counted then were cast.  That would mean that 1 in 10 votes counted were not cast and the election is completely fraudulent (which we know anyway).
1340665406575370240 2020-12-20 22:28:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Love4Alberta @LoriIllia Yes, as a proxy for China.
1340665103608238080 2020-12-20 22:27:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CodeMonkeyZ @TrumpsDisciple Will this be the last year, 2020, that we will be a free country and Constitutional Republic?
1340649925701320704 2020-12-20 21:27:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RepStevenSmith Hahahahaha.  Yup.
1340649018074963970 2020-12-20 21:23:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ParamjitGarewal @SamanthaSJones4 Because they were the only women that would sleep with them?  Just a wild guess, but to me Soros and the others are not hot.
1340648116718981120 2020-12-20 21:19:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cparham65 ! The claim that @twitter is a fair and honest platform and is not a publisher and is entitled to protection under Section 230 is disputed.  Hey, see what I did there?
1340646372739977216 2020-12-20 21:12:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @happycanuck1974 @RichHiggins_DC You do know that Ryan McCarthy &amp; Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville serve at the pleasure of the President &amp; have no say on whether or not they obey a legal order?  It is not the place or purpose of the military to declare policy.  They can resign if they have objections.
1340645163731849217 2020-12-20 21:08:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JohnCornyn @45_4USA Bang bang with Fang fang and a couple of bucks thrown in.  Democrats (and RINOs) are pure rot in the framework of our republic.
1340643677438234624 2020-12-20 21:02:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kleensamsonite @Calendula2016 @DanScavino "Nations do not die of invasion; they die of internal rot".  We are overwhelmed with rot.  Will we survive?
1340642559509495808 2020-12-20 20:57:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RepSwalwell Fang Fang.
1340458513617702912 2020-12-20 08:46:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @yogagenie @RealPNavarro Happens all the time in Marxist banana republics.
1340458198533206016 2020-12-20 08:45:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @roxyloveslucy @Maximus_4EVR LOL, right.  Gun crime is rampant in DC.  Besides, if a few million armed people show up, who are they going to send out to arrest them?
1340446578402705410 2020-12-20 07:59:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Maximus_4EVR @roxyloveslucy What if they brought their guns?
1340426732839432192 2020-12-20 06:40:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit It is not their call.  If they have trouble serving they can always resign and move over to the Chinese Army.
1340350221868404742 2020-12-20 01:36:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Nigel_Farage Actually I would say enjoy Christmas this year as fully as you can.  If the Marxists steal the country this may be your last chance to do so.
1340349460480544768 2020-12-20 01:33:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DineshDSouza @AlexMimikosyaho Good to see more on rumble and less on youtube.
1340346507866689537 2020-12-20 01:21:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SeaneyPatriot Nah, look at the Obamacare vote.  He is dirty and has been so forever.
1340346157478727681 2020-12-20 01:20:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @1Usmcusa @RealSaavedra @DonaldJTrumpJr After watching the last election and now following the massive Democrat Fraud aftermath, Are you really sure that the people chose him?
1340339996268498951 2020-12-20 00:55:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TheRISEofROD Will the die be cast?
1340339272537108480 2020-12-20 00:52:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ksorbs Doesn't matter.  With they steal and their China subsidy, they will be fine
1340338012039700480 2020-12-20 00:47:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @matthewdmarsden No
1340319331255635970 2020-12-19 23:33:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @heretosaveday07 @alpipkin It does not matter at this point.  The Democrat + RINO control over the outcome &amp; garbage Courts will not bend to the truth.  Evidence is meaningless and dismissed out of hand.  Only two possible solutions or the country dies quietly; insurrection act &amp; martial law or civil war.
1340318396835979264 2020-12-19 23:29:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TheRISEofROD @PRAETORIANOF76 It is time to make that crossing once again.  The die will be cast and the fight will be joined.  No mercy.
1340314831157567488 2020-12-19 23:15:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Truthseeker126 @Godwins1234 But the pizzerias and bagle shops have been shut down.  So in essence NYC is good for nothing.
1340312496708567040 2020-12-19 23:06:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kylie_oneil75 @CuteScarley It's more.  A moral compass is not required for an interpretation of the law.  Decisions should not be made on moral considerations, rather on legal ones.  For example, Robert's decision on Obamacare.  His vote was based on the bogus &amp; initially denied premise that it was a tax.
1340293936514887681 2020-12-19 21:52:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GovKemp @WhiteHouse Fuck you.

For example, Cuba &amp; Venezuela.
1340079066985086996 2020-12-19 07:38:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ScottPresler @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Idle threat.  The election for Governor will be run by the same people and on the same machines the last election was.    The people of GA do not have a chance for an honest election.
1340077873827205121 2020-12-19 07:33:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @familyman20181 @TruthEqsJustice Trump better get off the dime and implement EO 13818 and Martial Law.  There are only 6 looting days left to Christmas and the Democrat faithful need the go ahead.
1340076756846329856 2020-12-19 07:29:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @17anonjohn @TruNews @realDonaldTrump One can hope.
1340076138186469376 2020-12-19 07:27:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cmassaro @MarkDice @seanmdav @FDRLST OK, I can see why Fang Fang came all the way from China to rip off a piece from that man.
1340075773055520768 2020-12-19 07:25:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @seanmdav @FDRLST I wonder if Chinese spy Fang Fang was sleeping with @RepSwalwell  because he is so studly and sexy and wonderful in bed or she was getting American State secrets from him.  That is a hard one to figure out.
1340058142286045186 2020-12-19 06:15:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Can2geterdone @superyayadize @GenFlynn @realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich @SidneyPowell1 It is down to it now.  No time left.  Either Trump goes for the Insurrection Act and Marshall law or the country is gone.  It is a horribly tough decision and I am glad that I do not have to make it, but make it I would to save the country and the great Americans in it.
1340056326727028736 2020-12-19 06:08:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CorporalBen @gatewaypundit Need any clearer indication of election fraud in Arizona?
1340055864586072064 2020-12-19 06:06:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ighaworth @NikkiHaley @DanCrenshawTX @realDailyWire If Biden illegally takes the WH, what makes you think that there will be a country in 2024?
1340044660350144514 2020-12-19 05:21:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit So a subpoena is a meaningless piece of paper now?  I am getting the feeling that the deal is that the Democrat's have stolen the election through massive fraud and there is nothing that the people of the country can do about it.  American citizens no longer have rights.
1340034482531835904 2020-12-19 04:41:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TheSharpEdge1 Stall the steal til it is to late to get an honest conclusion.  Time for martial law.

1340033757642776576 2020-12-19 04:38:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @charlesfowler So is the plan to review the case after Biden is sworn in?
1340033387961098241 2020-12-19 04:37:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @pepesgrandma Phuck the Supreme Court it is useless.

1340015635875557376 2020-12-19 03:26:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SexCounseling Not.
1340015495576055808 2020-12-19 03:26:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump Time to go and launch the counter attack.
1340015353393414146 2020-12-19 03:25:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FiveRights The fact that you asked about the Insurrection Act and Martial Law has been forwarded to the proper authorities in China by @google.  Think I'm kidding?
1340014670644609024 2020-12-19 03:22:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AndrewYang Actually, why not just tatoo some numbers on their foreheads?

1339988855974285313 2020-12-19 01:40:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PatVPeters The Surpreme Court in meaningless garbage.  No one respects it.

1339987494482268160 2020-12-19 01:34:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrMichaelBurkes I hear China is happy with him.
1339987067036553216 2020-12-19 01:33:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @InfidelAngela @no_silenced LOL, history is great to read, but not much fun to live through.
1339948105718874113 2020-12-18 22:58:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @may_talcott Does that mean that the Bronx High School of Science will get students with a 4th grade reading comprehension level?
1339915350335361024 2020-12-18 20:48:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bubblebathgirl @ennykinpa They will reach a decision by mid second term for Harris.  The Supreme Court is irrelevant.  How can 5 conservatives be pushed around by 3 liberals and a traitor?
1339908655253127171 2020-12-18 20:21:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto Maybe they should sue.  Hahahaha.

1339741425353670657 2020-12-18 09:17:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bloggasaurus The whole country prayed and fought and raised their voices for those three and they phucked us as thanks.  Our Supreme Court with two exceptions is a collection of excrement.

1339704088808701952 2020-12-18 06:48:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump We need the evidence.  If true, the people have to rise up.
1339703413248966656 2020-12-18 06:45:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto Big deal.  The Supreme Court cannot be trusted to come to an honest decision which protects the country.

1339700614712856576 2020-12-18 06:34:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec @nedryun Probably will be hundreds of thousands of illegal votes in GA, just like the initial election.

1339698879038570497 2020-12-18 06:27:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @IlhanMN Yeah, Democrat policies destroying small business really suck.  So what are you going to do about it?
1339698667104550913 2020-12-18 06:27:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KamalaHarris If the people spoke, why was there so much Democrat Election Fraud in favor of the person that was not named?  Why were their voices blocked out by your criminality?  Why was their sacred vote stolen?  Soon, if you criminally take the election, their voices will cry in pain.
1339672351365947392 2020-12-18 04:42:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Kassie917 @Purrpatrol @MichaelCoudrey So the Dominion CEO lied under oath.  Oh well, no harm, no foul in our wonderful Democrat Fraud world.
1339672047186690049 2020-12-18 04:41:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DrPaulGosar @realDonaldTrump @ali Interesting.  We, of course, need to see the proof.  If true, it is clear that China Kelly did not win the Senatorial race and @dougducey and others need to go to prison for certifying the election.

1339627843953672192 2020-12-18 01:45:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BrandonStraka I thought that this was a @TheBabylonBee satire until I found out, to my horror, that it was real.

1339555212395102209 2020-12-17 20:57:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @alpipkin Hey Mitch, that you?
1339369770232102912 2020-12-17 08:40:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto @Dagny_Galt IC confirms it won't give him the intellegence assessment in time for the Dec 18th deadline.  IC is fuck you America, we are stalling and running out the clock and there is nothing you can do about it.
1339368746872238080 2020-12-17 08:36:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BarryRChapman @POTUS The IC just told the DNI that they cannot provide the material by the deadline so there will be no report on Friday.
1339368012202221568 2020-12-17 08:33:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BigE34me Just enter one parameter into the Dominion Software and that is possible.
1339367283622232065 2020-12-17 08:30:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 @gatewaypundit But he can't issue a report because the IC won't meet the deadline to provide it's input.

Who would live a life of fear taking a knee to the thugs of the Soros Democrats, the Marxists?  Who would damn their children?  Who would be forbidden to love God?  Yes, well worth it.
1339307928549920768 2020-12-17 04:34:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @10thAmendment @feeonline Does that mean that if you live in Seattle and someone is breaking into your house, you need to request a financial statement before you blow them away?
1339307015294709761 2020-12-17 04:30:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CABImages @e_iaco @dougducey Depends on whether they are still using the Dominion machines.  Hell, Biden might win Gov of Arizona too if those machines are still on line.  PS - I block 15 follower fake bull shit accounts.  It has been nice talking with you, whatever you are.  Blocky
1339277094916771846 2020-12-17 02:31:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @babe_freedom There are 147,044,123 ways to get around that.  Good to know that Krebs and his merry band know every bad actor out there and their IPs.  But OK.
1339275793185165312 2020-12-17 02:26:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PamelaGeller Did that moron actually say that?  How can he say the algorithms did not work if he does not even know if they were there?  How can he say they did not work without extensive forensic testing which he did not do?  What a crock being shoved toward the American people.

1339242512867676160 2020-12-17 00:14:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @e_iaco I, as an Arizona voter who voted for McSally, agree.  There is no way that Arizona elected China Kelly.  Is is everything wrong that Arizona people reject.  Interesting how @dougducey could not wait to get him to the Senate as soon as possible.

1339194553216032769 2020-12-16 21:03:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LindaBeyer11 @ckolacia And my friends on the Supreme Court is why Texas has standing.  A fraudulent election can force that on a sovereign state and tax it's citizens to pay for it as long as that state adheres to the Constitution.  A state represents both itself and it's citizens.
1339189768396001288 2020-12-16 20:44:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bubblebathgirl Because he lied under oath which if you are a Democrat or criminal enabler of Democrats carries no penalty.
1339185301940359169 2020-12-16 20:27:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KelemenCari @FuctupMike Dear @twitter  This is not a claim, it is the result of forensic investigations.  That it indicates fraud is the only conclusion.

1338971944524206080 2020-12-16 06:19:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gigi_dutra Yes indeed, Dominion is a criminal cartel currently employed by the corrupt and fraudulent Democrats.
1338970005304578049 2020-12-16 06:11:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mtgreenee Other than hiding the faces of Waters, Pelosi, and the like what protection does masks provide.
1338969816418271233 2020-12-16 06:10:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ConservVoice @gatewaypundit Considering the crimes committed, a little perjury is nothing at all.  Beside what Democrat / Marxist / America hater was ever prosecuted for lying under oath?  It is one of the safest crimes, along with election fraud, that you can commit.
1338966418709049344 2020-12-16 05:57:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @nancylee2016 Time for the insurrection act and marshal law and to set this class and the ones that proceeded and all oath takers loose to protect our great country.  Time to go.

1338939361384001536 2020-12-16 04:09:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JocelynBenson @realDonaldTrump Facts   1 He may have well won those counties by more with an honest vote and they contribute to the state total.  2. He "supposedly" lost the state, so the counties that count where most of the massive Democrat Election Fraud took place determined the outcome.  So stop the shit.
1338937847324180481 2020-12-16 04:03:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MAGAChronicle @EvanAKilgore It tells me that they received my vote.  I was being flip in my tweet.  There is no way to know once your vote hits the machine how it is processed.
1338902410643742721 2020-12-16 01:43:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EvanAKilgore @MAGAChronicle Just curious.  I voted for Trump and McSally.  Is there any way to find out who was actually credited with my vote?

1338884731962716163 2020-12-16 00:32:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MarkFinchem @WingsofCrystal 2/2  Hopefully, the audit will also include checking of the actual ballots for signature verification and illegal votes and voters.  Also hopefully, this will look at the down ballots because there is no way that China Kelly took the Senate Seat.  Did Biden get my Trump vote?
1338884067039703043 2020-12-16 00:30:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MarkFinchem @WingsofCrystal 1/2  Run Hobbs Run Ducey  You can make it to China before the audit is completed.  The MI audit determined that the Dominion Machines were rigged and that attempts were made to cover up the election fraud and key logs deleted contrary to law.  AZ will likely show the same.

1338863506632761344 2020-12-15 23:08:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDSteinberg @EntheosShines Truth.  The constitution is a contract between sovereign states which designates certain authorities to a federal union.  Election fraud by one state effects all because of the power it cedes to tax, regulate, police, protect common borders, etc.  Such fraud voids that contract.

I wonder how such a strange coincidence occurred.  I wonder what the new Secretary of Defense would say about that.

1338614011496034304 2020-12-15 06:37:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cmarinucci So a #CCP member and professional spy came to America so she could have fang fang with Swalwell because she liked the smell of his passing gas and figured while she was here she would also bop a few mayors.  Having sex with a spy did not spark a suspicion of wrongdoing.  @FBI 🤣
1338610951579258881 2020-12-15 06:24:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @American1299 I will bet the farm that this happened in Arizona and both Trump and McSally won by a large margin.  This is unacceptable.

He missed his calling and would been better off in Nazi Germany where orders were followed.  If we allow this to stand, we are in a police state run by Marxist Democrats.  This is intolerable.

1338607123526164480 2020-12-15 06:09:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Hey @dougducey.  Now that the first forensic audit of Dominion Systems show that they are rigged and were used by the Democrats to commit massive Election Fraud, do you still stand by your certification that the Arizona election results are true and honest?  I'm pissed.
1338606514865459200 2020-12-15 06:07:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @freep The report showed the Dominion Systems are totally rigged, they were part of the Democrat Election Fraud, &amp; that an attempt was made to cover up the crimes they were used to commit.  The MI AG tried to cover up the findings of criminal activity  Pretty much as expected  Now what?

1338564921106202627 2020-12-15 03:22:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @P8R1OT @SittinPrettyJo Biden would send in Chinese Troops to confiscate their property.
1338563531864588289 2020-12-15 03:16:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @nypost @kentpg Will his 75 person security detail be wearing masks and let anyone within 100 feet of him?
1338562052210626560 2020-12-15 03:10:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GKeile @JackySinAZ The Supreme Court will probably rule that the American People have no standing to challenge massive Democrat Election Fraud funded by the Chinese.
1338558407616258049 2020-12-15 02:56:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @alfajean @MulliganTrails Wow, between him and @RepSwalwell  and gosh knows who else, Fang Fang took a couple of bullets for her country.  There is not enough soap in the world to make her feel clean again.
1338557793431797760 2020-12-15 02:53:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Hey @dougducey, how about an audit of the Maricopa County Dominion Machines now that the one in MI has show them to be rigged and not up to election standards?  Ask your Chinese handler if it is OK.
1338535910342709248 2020-12-15 01:26:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 @gatewaypundit Add to that a failed attempt to wipe the machines &amp; you have massive Democrat Election Fraud and the criminal disenfranchisement of American Voters.  All locations with Dominion hardware &amp; software are suspect.  How do you think Biden / Kelly won in Arizona.  @Dougducey.
1338505546052194304 2020-12-14 23:26:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Herbert_L_Reed Will representatives of the #CCP be attending on @dougducey's behalf?
1338504971902324744 2020-12-14 23:23:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sayitnspinit The Supreme Court in a 7 to 2 ruling declared itself irrelevant and meaningless and voted to allow Joe Biden to become president and destroy it through packing.  The yabba dabba doo ruling of no standing was both incorrect and bullshit.
1338503344680173569 2020-12-14 23:17:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dougducey   I voted for Trump &amp; McSally  How can I find out who was actuallly credited with my vote?  My vote was counted on Dominion System hardware.  I have no confidence that it was honestly, faithfully, &amp; truly tallied  You certified the election.  Did you disenfranchise me?
1338499611128778752 2020-12-14 23:02:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn @carterwpage Little tidbit here: 600 party members across 19 branches working at the British banks HSBC .  HSBC is the bank accused of money laundering for cartels (Comey on it's board) &amp; was let off with fines &amp; no prosecutions by Mueller &amp; Holder.  Also involved with Dominion for China.
1338496458476011520 2020-12-14 22:49:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal @dougducey Actually that raises an issue in my mind.  I voted for Trump and McSally in Arizona, who was my vote actually credited to?  I have no way of knowing and with China @DougDucey and Dominion Vote counting machines I don't know if Biden &amp; Kelly got my vote.  I feel dirtied by Ducey.

1338492103458865153 2020-12-14 22:32:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal @dougducey How much was @dougducey paid to sell out his state and his country?  He could not certify China Kelly's fraudulent election and get him to the Senate fast enough.  Arizona is not China and will never come under it's thumb no matter how corrupt our politicians are.

Who is he going to rely on to address the Criminal Democrats, China, evil actors?  The @FBI, @TheJusticeDept, the courts, who?  If civil war, better now than later.
1338482212031717381 2020-12-14 21:53:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @nca8190 @Eyconik Agreed, that is not good enough.  Many are tired of dancing around the evil.  The cancer must be cut out &amp; ended with quick certainty.  China must be gone from our country.  Soros &amp; his hate must be ended.  Criminal officials need be tried and dealt with.  Had it with the crap.

1338261232437002240 2020-12-14 07:15:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MajorPatriot @GarrisonBlue @gatewaypundit It will be interesting to see how many members of the #CCP work for our gov't, our MSM, teach in our schools,  work in social media companies, and other key companies like @Google, defense contractors, information technology, etc.

One is the widespread &amp; rampant massive Democrat Election Fraud.  It leaves one wondering how many elected officials, mostly Democrats &amp; sell out RINOs, were really elected.

He has the proof of foreign interference in the election (looking at China, Iran, Venezuela, Cuba &amp; others).  Will he push the button?  I sure hope so and then lets roll.

Biden's handlers &amp; his Chinese owners are afraid that Trump is going to pull the Insurrection Act since there is tons of proof of foreign interference.  They are going to try to get the country worked up.

1338123495583059968 2020-12-13 22:07:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealCandaceO @gailtalk So as I understand it, the Supreme Court feels that the signatories to the Constitution have no right to challenge fraudulent election results that will install an corrupt and criminal president that will have executive power over their states and people therein.  Martial law!!!!

Arizona is a deep read state and it's people have been disenfranchised.

The Supreme Court is the arbiter of disputes under &amp; of violations of that agreement.  If they do not rule &amp; some states can fraudulently disenfranchise others, there is no constitution.    The precedent is it's charge.

Do Americans have no right to have their votes counted; Supreme Court?  Does Texas have the right to a fair vote under the Constitution?

With the massive fraud from top to bottom, no one has a clue how many votes the Democrats actually get in any race from dog catcher to president.
1337895579368574977 2020-12-13 07:02:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @USMCMILO3 Considering that it is China, did Hunter get any Fang Fang and high quality drugs to round out his payments?

1337885048297537538 2020-12-13 06:20:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BeholdIsrael @ocmtber 2/2  of the contract, the constitution, voided it because a contract with no method of enforcement by the signatories is meaningless and not worth the parchment that it is printed on.  The remedy is simple, do not count the votes that were cast in violation of the contract.
1337883696477552640 2020-12-13 06:15:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BeholdIsrael @ocmtber 1/2  Beyond that, the Constitution is a contract between the states.  If one state violates the terms of the contract the others are effected parties.  The only way to adjudicate any claim is through the action by the supreme court.  The supreme court by not enforcing the terms
1337882486177599490 2020-12-13 06:10:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BeholdIsrael @ocmtber SCOTUS screwed the pooch on that one.  The question is, are these esteemed Constitutional Scholars morons or did they do it on purpose?  Every State subject to any degree to federal law or regulation as put forth and/or enforced by the executive is effected by the election result

If you consider the Dominion Changed votes, the Trump votes trashed and/or changed, and other things like people turned away from voting, the number is likely much higher.

The #InsurrectionAct is sooner, letting the Marxist left take over is later.  Sooner is preferable because it will before significant damage and suffering occur &amp; before the Marxists control the gov't

They screwed the pooch.

1337814109811666944 2020-12-13 01:38:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @123RHGreen @WingsofCrystal So American Citizens and the states in which they reside have no standing to sue to stop massive Democrat Election Fraud.  Who does?  Or is the Supreme Court totally useless?
1337813414861684736 2020-12-13 01:35:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CodeMonkeyZ @WingsofCrystal Hiding proof of election fraud is the obvious guess.
1337812844994150401 2020-12-13 01:33:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CodeMonkeyZ 3/3  Or does he leave quietly &amp; witness America devolve into  that Marxist dictatorship with significant foreign control.  The suffering of the American people will be great &amp; civil war, from the right, will ensue.  Again with much blood lost &amp; the structure of America destroyed.
1337812054036545538 2020-12-13 01:30:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CodeMonkeyZ 2/3  It is clear that the American Marxist left &amp; NWO elitists in conjunction with foreign enemies have engaged in massive election fraud to gain control of the country.  America will be remade into a totalitarian dictatorship run mainly by the few super wealthy &amp; Chinese.
1337810994429456384 2020-12-13 01:26:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CodeMonkeyZ 1/3  Trump has a decision to make.  A most difficult, almost impossible one.  Does he impose martial law and void the election and then clean out the extensive rat's nest that has brought blight to this country?  The result would likely be civil war and much blood spilled.
1337750903701471232 2020-12-12 21:27:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y @RalphNortham Three golden rules of Virginia.  Stay at home. Kill a baby. Wear a mask.  How much election fraud did it take to get @RalphNortham elected?
1337750570766016513 2020-12-12 21:26:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced @twatter us blocking replys to you.
1337738708733186050 2020-12-12 20:38:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EvanAKilgore Yes.
1337736111452352514 2020-12-12 20:28:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BeholdIsrael Which is bullshit since the president has great effect over the states.  A fraudulently elected president with policies contrary to the best interests of a state, has great impact on the welfare of that state.  Immigration and trade are two examples.
1337734630888247297 2020-12-12 20:22:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DepolableDuck @brigett48528631 In a few years we may have Iranians &amp; Cubans patrolling our streets.
1337733831323881473 2020-12-12 20:19:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced Just make sure that Dominion does not count the vote
1337733451332501507 2020-12-12 20:18:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @scott_helmick @DanPatrick So the election is stolen by massive election fraud, fang fanged &amp; bribed states violate the constitution, &amp; Americans are disenfranchised &amp; the Supreme Court does not want to hear about it.  Maybe Biden should pack ii because it is a useless garbage heap in any case.
1337731189470203904 2020-12-12 20:09:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump No law.
1337553544958734336 2020-12-12 08:23:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ruthtaka They do if those procedures violate the Constitution.
1337551544120532992 2020-12-12 08:15:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @thetoyman1 @okramar @realDonaldTrump Likely this is the last thing that the Supreme Court does before it is packed &amp; becomes meaningless.  America is officially over.  I don't know what will replace it, but it will be hard times for all.  China just won the war against America and did not have to fire a single shot.
1337529460208193536 2020-12-12 06:47:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ambjg @JoshShapiroPA I am sure that the reeducation that will take place in the Gulags that you will build will go a long way to change people's minds.
1337529156007911427 2020-12-12 06:46:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JoshShapiroPA What a load of horse shit.  An insult to @SCOTUS.  Other than Texas State bad there is nothing to it.  The only perhaps legal point is that the residents of Texas suffered no harm as a result of the massive China/Soros/Elites funded Democrat Election Fraud in the named states.
1337521996712665088 2020-12-12 06:17:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @thebradfordfile @TheRISEofROD Agreed, Trump should offer Biden a pardon for his entire family if he gives all of the treasonous bastards up.

1337498212186263552 2020-12-12 04:43:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LeslieMarshall 1. Bull shit. 2. No one likes the outcome of massive Democrat Election Fraud. 3. Besides the fraud, PA violated the state &amp; American Constitutions &amp; by doing so caused harm to the residents of Texas and every other state in the union. 4. Dangerous is China with fang fang &amp; cash.
1337438989276463110 2020-12-12 00:47:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MaryUlinger @BentleysrTroy @RudyGiuliani If the people of America take sides, it will soon be apparent how many people voted for Trump and how few voted for Biden.
1337437770751479810 2020-12-12 00:43:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jsolomonReports Would we not be better off, if the government shut down?  And stayed shut down until the harm done to the people of America can be addressed.
1337436828387790849 2020-12-12 00:39:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @IngrahamAngle @RepMattGaetz Because America, it is up yours and what are you going to do about it?  Citizens are supposed to address overt fraud and treason by their votes, but we all know how that works out.
1337436206066323456 2020-12-12 00:36:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 China, Soros, BLM, .....  The Democrats are like cheap hookers, they sell out to everybody.  The more cheap tricks, the more money made.  Fang fang + cash will buy any of them.

This is the same crap that we heard about Sessions and that turned out to be a pile of rancid waste.  PS - By prematurely do you mean before the full force of Democrat Election Fraud was applied?
1337431286093291521 2020-12-12 00:17:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 Pelosi will also not share the pictures that the #CCP sent her to help control the Democrat Reps. with the rest of us.
1337430152070844418 2020-12-12 00:12:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> As an Arizona State resident, I agree with the Representatives &amp; call for Election Result Decertification.  I also call for an investigation into the Senatorial race, because China Kelly ended up the "winner" because of massive Democrat Election Fraud signed off on by @dougducey.
1337428239946379265 2020-12-12 00:05:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @nypost To bad, I really thought that he would be decent and work to bring back the trust in law in the country.  It is starting to look like he is just another deep state leech.
1337388303524352000 2020-12-11 21:26:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NickAdamsinUSA Depends on what China orders them to do.
1337387163244085256 2020-12-11 21:22:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MoooPapa They probably have plans to land Chinese troops.

1337382523416969217 2020-12-11 21:03:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ladymil14 @montaga @4allusapatroits Indeed, many of the people killed in China after the Revolution were the "intellectuals" and traitors that enabled and abetted the revolution.  Simple, no Marxist dictatorship wants such people around because they will eventually attack and betray it.
1337381899023486979 2020-12-11 21:01:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DramaticManatee @HyltonRobin If you read the filings, they are like the PA one which asserts no legal principals but rather makes unsubstantiated claims about upending states election systems and somehow being anti federalist.  Upending unconstitutional and fraudulent state systems is a good.
1337380212456128512 2020-12-11 20:54:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sniperkitty_009 @HyltonRobin I hate to break it to you, but the numbers overwhelming won the election for Trump.  Don't confuse the actual vote with the fraudulent count.
1337379888286683137 2020-12-11 20:53:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HyltonRobin How many Americans support the Texas law suit.  Since the vote count was badly changed / skewed by the massive Democrat Election Fraud, I would think that a large majority of Americans do.  That is key because the premise of American gov't is the consent of the people.

1337377049443373056 2020-12-11 20:41:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bone_Brake @ReneeCarrollAZ GA legislators also did so.  That is two of the four states being sued, to now, with legislators siding with the people suing them.

So it seems that legislators in two states who have constitutional control of their states electors have joined Texas in suing their own states.  MI next?
1337373926800777217 2020-12-11 20:29:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AltCovid19 @RyanAFournier The way the Chinese and Soros and other evil funded Democrats fraudulently count votes, it does not make any difference how many Republicans there are voting in any election.

1337208465840689153 2020-12-11 09:31:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mtracey Since when did states rights become the equivalent of massive Democrat Election Fraud?  Considering the criminality of the Democrat's manipulation of the election process, it is questionable if the "authority" of the sovereign states was legally obtained.

Although I speak for myself, I believe that most of Arizona agrees.  I would suggest as Arizona AG, you investigate the election fraud and criminal activity with respect to the election.

Cut the PA 🐂💩 and the question is did the Democrat Criminal Class violate their own state's and the American Constitution while engaged in Election Fraud?  That appears to be the main issue.
1337158463886032896 2020-12-11 06:13:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenMastriano LOL, so we have Arizona whose gov @dougducey certified completed fraud as true joining the suit to essentially overturn the fraud and now PA who is being sued for rampant election fraud has 24 Senators joining to sue the criminals in their own state.  Everyone has seen the fraud.
1337153851128913920 2020-12-11 05:54:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @pepesgrandma Dig he go for cash, fang fang, or both.  @GovKemp is so dirty and it is so obvious.

He needs to be tried for treason and after the execution we can determine who leaked the information.
1337150094672449536 2020-12-11 05:40:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TrumpRulzz As an Arizona resident who believes that there was a massive amount of Democrat Election Fraud signed off on by @dougducey and who believes that China Kelly did not win the Senatorial race, I encourage the Judiciary Committee to dig as deep as necessary and expose the steal.
1337128441745874945 2020-12-11 04:13:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bryan700 As an Arizona resident, I resent the China steal engineered and implemented by @DougDucey and Kelly.  Arizona is a red state even if we have some of our "leaders" owned and directed by China and the McCain cartel.
1337127363880968192 2020-12-11 04:09:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Scott77609389 @roxyloveslucy @LATiffani1 @ResidentOfFL The #TexasCase should have them terrified.  The Democrats, RINOs, Deep Staters, NWO Elitists, MSM, &amp; Chinese fang fanger owned government sell outs are exposed.  The criminality, corruption, &amp; treason are clear &amp; the "Case" will shine a true light on the evil that has beset us.
1337124918857588738 2020-12-11 03:59:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @themodalice @yardonna If the US breaks out into civil war because of the massive Democrat Election Fraud as aided by wholly owned RINOS, do you think that China will protect @govkemp?  Asking because I am curious.
1337123864929652736 2020-12-11 03:55:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Navy_Lady_45 @CrazyCatRescuer So fang fang, a professional Chinese spy, was bang banging @RepSwalwell because she liked his tiny ying yang and the smell of his fart farts.  Next he is going to tell us that Biden won honestly.
1337122960147017728 2020-12-11 03:52:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealWayneRoot @CarolChupp @realDonaldTrump Considering the massive Democrat Election Fraud, there may be not that many who voted for Biden.
1337122634148925440 2020-12-11 03:50:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @vicksiern Chinese owned politician who sold out his country.  You left that choice out.
1337111200291725312 2020-12-11 03:05:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HC_Richardson Swalwell was thinking of and working for the @FBI as he fang fanged the Chinese spy.  C'mon man, even Democrats are not stupid enough to bo that one.
1337106602776621056 2020-12-11 02:47:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @American1299 @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA @RepDougCollins Actually, I would like to see him in jail.
1337075034725105664 2020-12-11 00:41:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bubblebathgirl Because her Chinese handler instructed her to.  Just a guess.
1337071607966101504 2020-12-11 00:28:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 @vicksiern Agree.  Cruz has shown his true colors and they are red, white, and blue.  Sen. Cruz is much appreciated.
1337071174237360128 2020-12-11 00:26:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Rparkerscience @Sundncefn @gatewaypundit Last I heard that @GovKemp was blocking the ability of the legislature to meet and issue a subpoena for Rattenspliger.  How many China bucks and fang fangs will Kemp be getting for his assistance in massive Democrat Election Fraud?
1337070344213970947 2020-12-11 00:23:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RudyGiuliani @davis_levin I thought @GovKemp  blocked the legislatures proposed meeting to keep it from subpoenaing the Sec of State Rattensplerger to question him about election fraud.  Is this something else?
1337014892809703426 2020-12-10 20:42:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GeorgiaPatriot6 @SureGotIt1 True?
1337013021713920000 2020-12-10 20:35:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tracybeanz @BrianKempGA  is blocking a meeting of the state legislature which was called to investigate the election fraud that he certified as true.  He needs to see the inside of a jail.
1337000330379161600 2020-12-10 19:44:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @C_3C_3 @LibertyBell1000 Truth.
1336847811552284676 2020-12-10 09:38:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @UROCKlive1 Go fang fang yourself!
1336846712372035584 2020-12-10 09:34:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SandyForLiberty 18 states.  Hold onto your hat, Arizona just joined the other 17 plus Texas.
1336846178827190272 2020-12-10 09:32:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @liquidlaugh No
1336844679225044993 2020-12-10 09:26:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> I am retiring for the night and will be pondering how @RepSwalwell  was able to fang fang a Chinese Spy and not come down with a disease.  I guess it was before Covid, but she got around as much as Harris.
1336843369641693184 2020-12-10 09:21:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NickAdamsinUSA Eric Swalwell should be deported to China.
1336843271553732612 2020-12-10 09:20:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @chuckwoolery @BlissTabitha Hahahaha
1336842063925559296 2020-12-10 09:16:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MaryWarrick18 @cannoneerfour A couple of real fang fangers if I have ever seen one.  It is amazing how many of our upper crust elites have sold us and the country out.  Does China own CBS, just asking.
1336841145083555840 2020-12-10 09:12:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ScottyPatriot1 @dougducey Just checked it out and it is true.  This is the strangest thing I ever heard.  My state, which through extreme huge fraud went to Biden (and China Kelly) &amp; had the governor @dougducey certify that the criminal acts were true representations of Arizona's vote is now suing.  Jeeze
1336839344997318656 2020-12-10 09:05:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ScottyPatriot1 How can that be considering that @dougducey is so corrupt and owned?  Has the AG Brnovich done it considering that his state is the victim of massive Election Fraud which the governor certified?  If true, that would be classic to beat the band.
1336837548476223490 2020-12-10 08:58:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @OANN She should move to CA, works for Waters.
1336837359027978240 2020-12-10 08:57:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @American1299 Texas, seventeen states &amp; you to date are fighting to keep their constituents from being disenfranchised.  They are addressing the unconstitutional actions taken by four states.  Suits based on massive Democrat Election Fraud are not being heard.  Why not?
1336834401334820864 2020-12-10 08:45:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @pvtjokerus @gardenofthegods Your right.  No time to be silent.  The Chinese, Soros, NWO Elitist funded Democrats &amp; RINOs (who also were fang fanged and are being blackmailed) executed massive Election Fraud and are trying to illegally take over the country by disenfranchising it's citizens through fraud.
1336823648540233728 2020-12-10 08:02:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Can't they do some kind of fraud thing like have the petition signatures counted by Dominion?
1336817304932294656 2020-12-10 07:37:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced Civics?
1336814725108101120 2020-12-10 07:27:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @USAO_DE @TheJusticeDept policy of not prosecuting any elite Democrat or addressing Chinese spies also prohibits comment.
1336814059509837825 2020-12-10 07:24:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods @USMCMILO3 Why isn't the term fang fang or to be fanged not trending.
1336813465051119616 2020-12-10 07:22:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PatriotKimmie Arizona because of @Dougducey selling out to China, the McCain cartel, and Elites.  Be sure of one thing, Arizona is deep red and no amount of Fraud is going to change that.
1336813015908302849 2020-12-10 07:20:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sioxielegend So 18 states are going to the highest court in the land because Biden took away their people's rights and disenfranchised them by massive Democrat Election fraud.  I can't wait until the once almost president elect claims a mandate for his policies.
1336812094834896898 2020-12-10 07:16:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MAGA2ARIGHTS @KidukSong You haven't lived until you tried twice banged fang.
1336811461289496576 2020-12-10 07:14:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @wendyp4545 @jimbrown1964 LOL, I wonder if the AZ state legislature can vote to join the Texas law suit.  That would put a bomb up @dougducey 's fang fang.
1336810746005520384 2020-12-10 07:11:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Maggie50931562 Hopefully, we will end up in Trump's column.
1336810216571039744 2020-12-10 07:09:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AndrewCMcCarthy @NRO Actually it is Texas and 17 other states now.  Frivolous?  My ass!  Election fraud and theft of the country for Chinese Fang Fang and buckets of cash is serious stuff.
1336808363569471489 2020-12-10 07:02:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mel_faith1 @williamlharbuck @BrianKempGA Maybe he got in on the Fang Fang thingy too.  Cash and Fang will move many.  Besides the people who fell into that trap are likely being blackmailed out the wazoo.  I think a good look by a military tribunal of @GovKemp  is in order.
1336806539596689409 2020-12-10 06:54:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kidscientist @kylenabecker Actually it was the Chinese paid off and Fang Fanged Officials with participation of the Soros ilk Elites, Deep State, &amp; MSM that have spoken.  And most of America does not like what they said.  America overwhelmingly voted for Trump, so when you say "us" who exactly do you mean?
1336805625037168640 2020-12-10 06:51:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kylenabecker So 18 states are, in essence, alleging massive Democrat Election fraud and violation of States and Federal Constitutions.  There is no way, no matter the outcome, that Biden could govern with the consent of the governed.  Everyone knows that Trump was elected by a wide margin.
1336804748867956736 2020-12-10 06:47:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @wendyp4545 @jimbrown1964 The Biden 244 likely presumes AZ and Nevada.  I'm not positive but it seems likely.  AZ may have another idea through the state legislature.  Nevada was clearly a place of massive Democrat Election Fraud, but no one is taking it to the Supremes at this time.
1336803601960726529 2020-12-10 06:43:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @thehill Like anyone gives a phuck!  You guys have really gone down hill and that is not a pun.
1336802658477166592 2020-12-10 06:39:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @American1299 We probably need to go the Military Tribunal route since you can't trust the @FBI or @TheJusticeDept  to act against anyone selling us out to the Chinese.
1336802019328200704 2020-12-10 06:36:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @American1299 Rattenspergler needs jail time.  Was he paid off by the Chinese?  Did he have his own little Fang Fang?  Both?  Is the Ratten guy being blackmailed?  And what about @GovKemp , I bet he indulged in a little Chinese take out.
1336801057691762690 2020-12-10 06:33:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ScottyPatriot1 @FBI Yeah, you can't trust the @FBI for anything except for protecting criminal elites, Democrats, and with a few RINOs thrown in.  How many years did @RepSwalwell Fang Fang a Chinese spy and the @FBI did nothing.
1336761791649484801 2020-12-10 03:57:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @USAlivestrong Think of it this way, if there is a revolt against the Coup via massive Democrat Election Fraud and Chinese theft of America through Payoffs, Fang Fang sex, and blackmail the true Americans, the red on the map will have the numbers.
1336759881643163649 2020-12-10 03:49:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @dkrwilliams Hey guy, don't leave out Arizona.  I bet the fraud here was off the scale.  Dear Texas, I am hurt that you did not sue my state with the other four since China Kelly, China @dougducey and the McCains committed, enabled, and certified the results of massive Democrat Election Fraud
1336759354284855296 2020-12-10 03:47:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SureGotIt1 @gatewaypundit !  Everyone involved in this massive Democrat Election Fraud has Disputed this absolute proof of their guilt.
1336758001936416768 2020-12-10 03:41:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RudyGiuliani How do you say payoffs, Fang Fang sex, and blackmail in Chinese?
1336754169667973120 2020-12-10 03:26:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ScottyPatriot1 Any idea where the @FBI has hidden the servers presuming they indicated Democrat Election Fraud.
1336689952491360256 2020-12-09 23:11:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lavist1 We need martial law to clean out the rats nest of the Corrupt Election Fruad Democrats, NWO Elites, and their RINO bought helpers.  The vermin that are infecting our country are deadlier than any China Plague.
1336687193155272705 2020-12-09 23:00:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LadyRedWave Wouldn't you like to ask Fang Fang if he farts during sex?  #FangFang
1336480635704147968 2020-12-09 09:19:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MJI_2013 Presuming that the leaders of those states won by Democrat Election Fraud, most people in the states are conservatives and Americans.  A move to secede would be a grim mistake.
1336478947572293633 2020-12-09 09:13:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RudyGiuliani Good to hear.
1336436894394028032 2020-12-09 06:26:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @scotusreporter Clearly no dissents means something is going on.  People have mentioned that the denial was for the injunctive relief and that the case itself is not dead. Some are saying that the Texas case has much of the same charges and will be taken up.
1336428258741551104 2020-12-09 05:51:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChristianWalk1r @Donadeedooda In a great flash of insight the Democrat Election Fraud defenders will argue that one day means many days because what is is and what is time?  Time is relative and one day to many is many days to some.    Also considering one day to mean one day is racist.
1336427124907864064 2020-12-09 05:47:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @robbystarbuck @sulkyracer I can understand him not knowing Bacheria is, but after 8 years as VP not knowing the name of a cabinet post is a little disconcerting.  He may be totally gone, but China loves him.  PS - Isn't the Bacheria a viral infection being developed in China now?
1336425038501662721 2020-12-09 05:38:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mtgreenee @bap1757 @GaSecofState @GovKemp @GeoffDuncanGA @Clyde4Congress Time to sue for the run offs too.
1336424645310906369 2020-12-09 05:37:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @nigella_i5e @WingsofCrystal Every American state, most of our great nation, should file a law suit against the criminally corrupt governed states, you know states like GA whose governor is owned by China.  Please don't forget to sue Arizona, my state.
1336423042696691714 2020-12-09 05:30:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Volpi19Lou @gatewaypundit His order to allow observers in was ignored.  Guy can't be to happy.
1336422338204557312 2020-12-09 05:28:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit @45_4USA LOL  With half or more of the country on the verge of armed rebellion over the massive Democrat Election Fraud and the ensuing, in your face cover ups and lies, the Democrat response to the Supreme Court said that hearing the case may destroy peoples confidence in our elections.
1336420969984872448 2020-12-09 05:22:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AmericaFirst_DT This needs to be verified and then the Kraken set loose to arrest a lot of people.
1336419563131588611 2020-12-09 05:17:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DavidLimbaugh @debaroo54 Hey Florida.  You have a lot of people that escaped to America fleeing Marxist tyranny.  Surely you should sue to protect the freedom that they sacrificed all for.  Don't forget to sue my state, Arizona, when you do it.  Hey all American, red, states.  Time for you to sue.
1336419099186847745 2020-12-09 05:15:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit @PRAETORIANOF76 @DemandDanielAZ Great.
1336418899252838400 2020-12-09 05:14:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TomFitton My governor is @dougducey and I believe he is owned by China and is a McCain family suck up.  No justice or concern for the people of Arizona from him.
1336418395844055040 2020-12-09 05:12:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Barnes_Law Now we need the other red states to also sue.  Throw in Arizona in the next law suit.
1336418152981307393 2020-12-09 05:11:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TheJordanRachel Sex with him must have been a real gasser.  That woman deserves a medal from the @CCP.
1336417733391515648 2020-12-09 05:09:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @amyklobuchar No do the real votes.
1336417598397763585 2020-12-09 05:09:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ConservVoice She needs more time to work with her Chinese handlers.
1336345879385579521 2020-12-09 00:24:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @disclosetv Hahaha  I guess there may be legal precedence for not enforcing the law because people will find out how corrupt their elected officials are and how much China is paying them.  Phuck, let's toss the Constitution because the truth will escape the lady's box.
1336345139153784841 2020-12-09 00:21:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @Hadigee1 Look at all those people!  How much per head do you think that @GovKemp was paid to sell them out?
1336344392722833408 2020-12-09 00:18:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LLinWood @SototG How much do you think @GovKemp got from China for selling out you, me, GA, and the US?  Do you understand now why the Dominion Fraud machines were bought by GA?  Guy needs to be arrested and tried for treason.
1336343968464785408 2020-12-09 00:16:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @pam_sands @LibsNoFun If you could not understand why some RINOs and all Democrats appeared to engage in criminal acts to fraudulently elect China Biden and people like China Kelly in AZ, now you know.  They are on the take and have sold us out.
1336325850170474498 2020-12-08 23:04:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ScottyPatriot1 @brigett48528631 Worth looking at.
1336325151441395718 2020-12-08 23:01:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CROWENATION2020 @rising_serpent @CodeMonkeyZ Looks like Kemp sold out the people of GA.
1336324883978973188 2020-12-08 23:00:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CodeMonkeyZ Anyone know what the current penalty for treason is.  Is @GovKemp one of China's owned Inner Circle guys?  It sure looks like that.  Martial Law and military tribunals is the correct response.
1336323694495338499 2020-12-08 22:56:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AntonioSabatoJr @ChooChooLife @OANN @ChanelRion Strangely enough, as a resident of Maricopa County, I voted for Trump and Red down the line.  I also voted for conservative judges.  Now I am wondering if my votes or part thereof were actually credited to Biden &amp; Kelly.  It is unacceptable to have no faith in a fair count.
1336320800740110340 2020-12-08 22:44:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @disclosetv @PRAETORIANOF76 Texas let me down.  It should have sued Arizona, my state, too.  I'll let the people from Nevada make their own complaint.  There is no way Biden won in AZ and doubly now way China Kelly won the Senate Race.  Is @dougducey one of China's owned pets?
1336320168591384580 2020-12-08 22:42:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dbongino @VITOTttttt I think that we need to start finding out who in our "Inner Circle" of Elites and Gov't Officials are being paid off by China.  Then I think that they should be put on trial for treason.
1336318781165977600 2020-12-08 22:36:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @crt39437 That is why Martial Law is so important.

1336304376915263489 2020-12-08 21:39:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @pamellalala It is getting late in the game for @GovKemp to cut a deal.  I think that the death penalty for treason has been reinstated.
1336303641905352704 2020-12-08 21:36:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Fan4Cal @AU_bebe When sought for comment, it was identified that the Professor had just passed from Covid during his execution.  Just kidding, but I would not issue life insurance to that guy.

1336302326835863552 2020-12-08 21:31:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GOPWarLord China's inner circle?  What do you think?   https://t.co/tS0zerhDHg

1336301652853149698 2020-12-08 21:28:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PaulStout10 @reubing @TuckerCarlson @thehill Trump retweeted it.  I am sure that he and his people have been aware of the China Connection from day one.  It will not go away and may be the first step in making the public aware of the rational and need for martial law.  PS - The people you named are China's inner circle.
1336300401016991745 2020-12-08 21:23:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 Would your children be safer with her or China Joe?  That is a real poser.
1336300225011445760 2020-12-08 21:22:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CodeMonkeyZ PA falls and it is all over except for the yelling, screaming, and grunting noises coming from the Election Fraud left.  Texas is now suing a number of the states whose election were run by criminally corrupt Democrat Operatives.
1336299269003755520 2020-12-08 21:19:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DailyCaller We need martial law and a house cleaning by Military Intellegence.  The most interesting thing is that with the @FBI, @TheJusticeDept , and @CIA among other agencies tasked with protecting America, the Chinese have operated with impunity.  Barr &amp; Wray are you owned?
1336298650750705664 2020-12-08 21:16:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KMCRadio @ResidentOfFL I am insulted for my state that Texas did not sue Arizona too.  There was substantial Democrat fraud here in both the Presidential and Senatoral election.  Is @dougducey on China's good list.  Is he owned?  Watch the "China" video from @TuckerCarlson last night.  It is all over.
1336297765819744257 2020-12-08 21:13:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joepalojoe How many Obama judges are on the 11th circuit.  Will this end up in the Supreme Court too.
1336297601151369221 2020-12-08 21:12:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SebGorka @JoeBiden Two observations.  1. Dr. Di is a bit premature, Biden has won nothing yet.  All he has done is moblize a large segment of America to oppose the massive Democrat Election Fraud.  2. If there was ever a case for Martial Law, Military Tribunals, and an MI investigation here it is.
1336295979096580097 2020-12-08 21:06:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @reubing Watch the @TuckerCarlson video on China from last night.  How much influence does China have with @thehill ?

1336111133673934850 2020-12-08 08:51:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MsAvaArmstrong @tonydasit1 I'd settle for Kemp and Ducey and work our way up to Biden.

1336058906355720192 2020-12-08 05:24:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Thomas1774Paine He also voted 5 times for Biden while he was on the run.
1336058329756389376 2020-12-08 05:21:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kylegriffin1 Dear MSM fop.  Since this was before an Obama appointed judge, of course they lost.  The law and evidence had nothing to do with the decision.  This was part of the dance to kick it upstairs.
1336057918353895424 2020-12-08 05:20:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Hoya97 @gatewaypundit So all the Republicans and watchers decided to a person to get up and leave on their own.  C'mon man, even Democrats aren't stupid enough to buy that steaming pile of 🐂💩.
1336057433584664576 2020-12-08 05:18:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LindaofNM1 How does he win in congress?  If the Supreme Court throws the large number of fraudulent votes counted in violation of the PA &amp; American Constitution and Trump is reelected because the rest of the states will follow or they allow the votes or make no decision in case Biden wins.
1336056701955440640 2020-12-08 05:15:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal Didn't the Biden people talk about Gulags?  I guess the lefts good buddies in China are showing them how to reeducate people.  Will Americans stand for this?
1336046641510400000 2020-12-08 04:35:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @USMCMILO3 GA just recertified.  I guess massive Democrat Election Fraud is not cause to not certify the results.  So where to from here, bend over and watch China and the Elites take over and rule our lives or say no and mean it?
1336045941439094786 2020-12-08 04:32:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tracybeanz @lavist1 We will know tomorrow or Weds.  If the Supreme court throws out the PA fraud votes (votes contrary to the states and US constitution), Trump wins because the rest of the states will roll.  If not, Biden wins by the fraud and the country will go through some real pain.
1336038694780735488 2020-12-08 04:03:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kylenabecker @debaroo54 This has to go to the Supreme Court.

No basis for claim before the election so no suit and to late to file after the election so suit thrown out.  This judge was an Obama appointed judge, so enough said.  First they cheat you, then they cram it down your throat.
1335989938773344256 2020-12-08 00:49:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KelemenCari Agreed, it is clear that now that the massive Democrat election fraud has gone down, there are a number of paid off judges (China, Soros, Democrat cartel, etc.) that will cram it down our throats and deny any and all justice.  Why disallow a review?

1335938034718498816 2020-12-07 21:23:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cvpayne Truth  Besides that, if the Democrats end up destroying our economy there will be no construction industry.  Mr. Moore will find out that the tax burden to pay for others and tumbling wages resulting form a Marxist regime with open borders will not make up for his student loan.

1335924348226478081 2020-12-07 20:29:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FrRobbieOCall If we let the Democrats, fronting for China, steal our country that is our future as well.
1335922827396927488 2020-12-07 20:23:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TX_WalkerRanger @ElizAKByrd I'd cut her some slack if she rats our Kemp, Rattensperger, Adams, the Democrat crime orginization, and Dominion.
1335921968365768709 2020-12-07 20:19:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tracybeanz @dpretto33RTM @EpochTimes Can't the County just start with shipping records from China and trace the ballots forward?  Perhaps there are records in NYS wearhouses that can establish the source of the Absentee Ballots.
1335919872748883968 2020-12-07 20:11:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PandaTribune @freedmeto Hey Kemp Hey Rattensperger  How dirty are you? How much China money did it take to get you to sell out your country?  Asking for the disenfranchised voters of GA.  Asking for the betrayed citizens of America.  PS - Same questions in AZ for @dougducey.
1335916737074630656 2020-12-07 19:59:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealMattCouch @Jinger_Ellie The Antifa Guy at Dominion who promised a Biden victory is also nowhere to be seen.

1335912975685697537 2020-12-07 19:44:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @Sethoh2 This is a must listen and a great exposure of how massive Democrat Election Fraud and Marxists on the Supreme Court and in gov't offices have disenfranchised the people of PA and made their votes meaningless.  To Democrats there is no law except what they say there is.
1335908934981353473 2020-12-07 19:28:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto One can always hope.

1335747702743736320 2020-12-07 08:47:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump LOL, of course @twitter flagged it.
1335721476276666369 2020-12-07 07:03:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PrivilegedLydia @LABeachGal1 She probably should go states (or military tribunal) and give it up before she is beyond the help of an attorney.

Kelly, who Ducey could not wait to appoint while votes were still being challenged is also another big China guy.

1335717368513720320 2020-12-07 06:46:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @disclosetv @BrianKempGA True?  Why doesn't @BrianKempGA just move to China.  He can take, my governor, @dougducey with him.  I live in the US, land of the free, not China, home of slavery and government control.  How much is sliding into Kemp's and Ducey's pockets from the sale of America?
1335715051567661056 2020-12-07 06:37:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GayRepublicSwag If we fail here, what makes you think that there will be a 2022 and 2024 election rather than a Democrat Controlled massive Election Fraud sh!tstorm?
1335714497567338502 2020-12-07 06:35:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @IvanPentchoukov @debrand1827 PS - How did @BrianKemp certify to votes with no chain of custody.  He needs a good look at.
1335714326297026560 2020-12-07 06:34:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @IvanPentchoukov @debrand1827 So they are invalid.  No chain of custody, no way to confirm the validity, no vote.  GA under @BrianKemp is a real work of art.

Not only did Trump win in a landslide, but I would bet dollars to doughnuts that McSally also won.  Did you notice how anxious Ducey was to get him to DC?  Ducey smells of McCain rot.

1335684142692851712 2020-12-07 04:34:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Hoya97 I think that the Trump Base needs to start removing the garbage (and there is a lot) from the Republican Party.  But before that, the massive Democrat (with RINO help) needs to be sorted out.

1335655227496624128 2020-12-07 02:39:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @McKaylaRoseJ I agree.  I wonder how many Democrat Officials in CA were actually legally elected?  Imagine the suffering and pain going on because of Democrat Election Fraud in that state?  Now imagine that spreading to the entire country by a puppet Biden Administration.

I wonder how many people were in on the buy of the Dominion Systems and how much they profited.
1335650459298582529 2020-12-07 02:20:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RSBNetwork @Kgarm115 This also shows that MSM in general and @foxnews are no longer relevant.

1335621482374778880 2020-12-07 00:25:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AngelKraken2 @bap1757 So sorry to hear.  Our girls are dear.  Belle.  Our little baby.  https://t.co/L3AGwtK007

1335577325325275138 2020-12-06 21:30:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @alicetweet Can we please stop the steal?  Just joking, it is what the election fraud Democrats do, they can't win honestly.
1335388085366878210 2020-12-06 08:58:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Liz_Wheeler @andy_legault Considering the massive Democrat Election Fraud that is the norm, is that even possible.  If he got only three votes, his, his wife, and Nancy, he would likely still win.
1335387613306388481 2020-12-06 08:56:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GeorgeHaught Most sorry.  May she rest in peace.
1335376273141424128 2020-12-06 08:11:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KelemenCari What would happen if all those people showed up at Kemp's home and demanded answers?

Stop talking and do something, withdraw your certification and bring in neutral people to look over the Dominion computers.  Also have your police talk to the Ruby person.

1335273899898982401 2020-12-06 01:24:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PhoenixRisingU @Godwins1234 No mercy!
1335237520867557377 2020-12-05 23:00:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LarrySchweikart You know, I use to think that too.  But I am not so sure now.  How much of the Democrat control of CA is due to election Fraud?  It seems to me that if CA had a honest election the leadership would be much different.
1335236034938896384 2020-12-05 22:54:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Then quit your senate seat.
1335219515332825088 2020-12-05 21:48:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AOC You are a moron.  Hershey bars were last sold for 5 cents in 11/69.  The average household income at that time was $ 7,900 / year.  So what is your point?

1335013973809217537 2020-12-05 08:11:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JenGriffinFNC It is a possibility.  If the courts go like the Obama skumbag in Nevada just did, that may be the only alternative.

That is the foundation on which our Republic was constructed.  The Declaration of independence affirmed the God given right to end a gov't that works contrary to the good of the "people".
1334834300898852864 2020-12-04 20:17:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA This claim about election fraud was disputed before it was know or the video found.  ! &lt;---- ?  Is @twitter's policy to label all proof of the massive Democrat Election Fraud as disputed?

1334830204187865088 2020-12-04 20:01:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @stillgray Apparently a group of Democrat Marxist fact checkers that work for @twitter disputed the video before it was discovered.

But, but, but, but that has been debunked even though it is true.  But, but, but, but I am tired of this sh!t and will not see my country sold to China and the Elites on the cheap.

1334616687933452288 2020-12-04 05:53:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tracybeanz Phuck, what more do you want?  Total massive Democrat Election Fraud.  How much China money bought this?  How much Soros money?  How many elites that want to send our jobs overseas paid for this?  Time to stand up or be crushed.

1334605919850663936 2020-12-04 05:10:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump Democrat election fraud.  We have seen the bottom of the cess pool denizens take the votes of our military, disentrancing those fighting in foreign lands.  Here is another putrid example of Democrats.  Buying the votes of desperately poor people for cheap.  Demeaning a nation.

1334246747070062592 2020-12-03 05:23:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Thomas1774Paine I wonder how much American politicians were paid for their help.

1334244378022268929 2020-12-03 05:13:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @may_talcott Why would China go to war with us when they can buy our politicians on the cheap?  The sh!t is going to hit the fan when they go into Taiwan, move into India, or take Japan shipping routes.  The Democrat administration will do nothing &amp; the world will end up on a war footing.

1334240468096311296 2020-12-03 04:58:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @guypbenson Ever here the expression, Fraud me once shame on you, Fraud me twice shame on me.  I do believe that everyone should get out and vote, as part of the game, but a Senate Majority with people like Romney, Collins, Murkowski on the R side is not a thing of hope.
1334239743828054018 2020-12-03 04:55:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @danhill2011 They also will soon end up in a Chinese run version of Venezuela.  Not much good their garbage degrees will do them then.
1334239456644136963 2020-12-03 04:54:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joelpollak I agree.  But the feeling is, why bother the Democrats will just steal this election too.
1334239172463194112 2020-12-03 04:53:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jsolomonReports So what, @CNN says it may be a news network and we all know how true that is.

1334237913681260544 2020-12-03 04:48:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bekind4america What about Kelly?  He was "given" the seat by @dougducey  when everyone knows that there was massive Democrat Election Fraud.  He may be in DC, but he does not represent me.  Not my Senator.
1334237383139577856 2020-12-03 04:45:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tom2badcat @Chnx003 For sure, it is Americans not the @GOP.

1334236544006193152 2020-12-03 04:42:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> With the definitive proof of fraud, can Kelly be pulled out of the Senate?
1334235724502106113 2020-12-03 04:39:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> This man was just sworn in as Senator from Arizona.  https://t.co/pgpNQu1zsf

1334233420856086528 2020-12-03 04:30:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Cernovich Arizona needs to rebel.  We are a state and a people that will not go down by obvious fraud.

1334212866908377089 2020-12-03 03:08:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KeepAZ_RED Looks like three possibilities.  Supreme Court, Martial Law, or  #2A.  I am an Arizona resident and find the Election Fraud unacceptable.  PS - I have no faith in one of the three possibilities listed above.

Good thing for him that there is massive Democrat Election Fraud or Cuomo would not be able to be elected dog catcher in NY.

1334158736554749955 2020-12-02 23:33:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump ! The claim of election fraud has been disputed by the people that committed the election fraud.

1333927119177490433 2020-12-02 08:13:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LivePDDave1 @ocmtber That is a big operation  A lot of people had to be involved.  A lot should go to jail.
1333916862556512257 2020-12-02 07:32:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RETTinol @tazmac55 McSally won Arizona.  Why was @dougducey so anxious to put China Kelly in the Senate?

1333915921404968960 2020-12-02 07:28:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Adorable_Todd You might want to let AG Barr know.  He hasn't seen any of the evidence.  I guess he was to busy to watch the state(s) legislature proceedings.
1333915610011422720 2020-12-02 07:27:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PeggyGraves18 @dougducey OK  @dougducey a person who lives in Arizona wants to know if you are stupid or part of a coup in conjunction with China to overthrow our government?  Thank you for your timely answer, I just know that you will want to be open with everyone in Arizona.
1333893457899712512 2020-12-02 05:59:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PeggyGraves18 @realDonaldTrump But, but, but, Arizona Governor @dougducey  certified that everything was on the up and up.  Is he just stupid? Is he part of the conspiracy? Was he just paid off and promised reelection? Why did he certify while testimony was being given concerning election fraud in his state?
1333891817494913024 2020-12-02 05:52:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @robdetf Up your a$$ America and there is not a thing you can do about it.
1333891115020210176 2020-12-02 05:49:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RyanAFournier @RonaldBruceBar3 If Barr does not hear the testimony he can claim that he heard no testimony.  Kind of how he is approaching massive China / Democrat Election Fraud.  Imagine the AG of the US letting China assist in the coup.

1333888622383091712 2020-12-02 05:40:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KelemenCari @andy_legault It also means that governors like @dougducey conspired with and worked with China to overthrow the government of the United States.
1333887839851823105 2020-12-02 05:36:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LarsLarsonShow Not if Dominion is counting the votes.

Hey @dougducey , you certified to the fairness and correctness of thes 300,000 ballots and named China Kelly my Senator.  I hope you end up in jail.
1333859807099449344 2020-12-02 03:45:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Timcast @skb_sara I think that they are going to go to Barr's not enough fraud to make a difference.

1333856787091492864 2020-12-02 03:33:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @roxyloveslucy So the Chinese government is counting our votes.  How many of our elected officials, governors and SoS, are compromised?  Looking at @dougducey in my state of Arizona.

1333855163400949760 2020-12-02 03:27:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RyanAFournier I agree.
1333848155553558529 2020-12-02 02:59:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @disclosetv So are we to understand that America's votes were counted by China?  Time for martial law.

1333804423248678912 2020-12-02 00:05:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto @vickib501 He is probably somewhere with Hunter and the Antifa Dominion guy who promised that Biden would win.

1333791489764196352 2020-12-01 23:14:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CBS_Herridge An order from a judge is meaningless to Democrats unless it is from one of theirs that they can use against opponents.

There was a 4K vote difference
1333788942684938242 2020-12-01 23:03:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dbongino @scott_helmick Yes, among others.  I recommend that @dougducey be impeached as well.
1333788415851069444 2020-12-01 23:01:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RudyGiuliani There is no way Biden won Arizona.  There is no way that Kelly was elected.  What we are seeing is massive Democrat Election Fraud and support by RINOs like Duecy that need a good look at.

1333749304251482112 2020-12-01 20:26:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dougducey Arizona citizen here.  You are full of sh!t.  A part of the state legislature was in the process of hearing testimony and receiving proof of massive election fraud in an election with a 4,000 vote margin as you certified that the results were true, correct, and complete.
1333585124810584065 2020-12-01 09:34:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LivePDDave1 @SIMikeSr @va_shiva The governor of Arizona @dougducey certified that the results are fair, honest, and complete.  He did so while testimony was being taken and evidence of fraud was being received by his own state legislature.
1333565477004558336 2020-12-01 08:16:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @OANN @dougducey The Sec of State and Governor of Arizona just certified that the election was fair, complete, and honest and a true representation of the votes while the state legislature was hearing testimony and receiving evidence of irregularities and fraud.

1333550842872414208 2020-12-01 07:17:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Patrici15767099 Arizona is a red state.  Election Fraud won't change that.

1333512524617056257 2020-12-01 04:45:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KelemenCari So what was the big rush for her and the governor to certify?  Why during the hearing to determine if what they were certifying was criminal election fraud?  It is almost as if they rushed to nail down the lie.
1333511750344347649 2020-12-01 04:42:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Qtah17 @ShakT222 @SidneyPowell1 Remember what the penalty for treason is.  If that is so found by a court of law (military tribunal will do) and @SidneyPowell1 needs someone to pull the switch in Arizona, I know plenty of people who will volunteer.
1333509985469222912 2020-12-01 04:35:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LABeachGal1 She is asking Biden for an Ambassadorship.    What do you think?

1333496704344068097 2020-12-01 03:42:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced Considering the massive Election Fraud going on, you can't vote them out.  If everyone in Arizona voted against them, by the time Dominion finished the count they would win.

1333496053807542272 2020-12-01 03:40:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KelemenCari @dougducey Not stupid, criminal.  Arizona will not stand for this.  A mountain of proof being presented as to Democrat Election Fraud while she certifies a 4,000 vote margin as claimed by Dominion.
1333494992799629313 2020-12-01 03:35:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bubblebathgirl Because she is part of the criminal conspiracy.  She needs to be held accountable.
1333494655971823616 2020-12-01 03:34:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Pouissant1 As the hearings progress and massive evidence is exhibited, most of which was know, the Secretary of State Confirms the Election Result.  It is clear that she is part of the Democrat criminal conspiracy for Election Fraud.  She needs to be investigated and prosecuted.
1333472543387176960 2020-12-01 02:06:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tghowe99 @EvanAKilgore They are busy reprogramming and wiping the machines all over the country.
1333472365246758912 2020-12-01 02:06:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ToddHeadleeAZ @EvanAKilgore Agree, not a true sample of our state but everyone in my family and that I know voted against Prop #208.  Hard to believe that anyone voted to increase tax.
1333433791038189568 2020-11-30 23:32:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Thomas1774Paine But he owns friends in high places.  https://t.co/720EWeySPE
1333410718889046017 2020-11-30 22:01:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal Hey look, a bunch of people risking their lives for America who had their votes flipped from Trump to Biden or trashed altogether.
1333382403646054401 2020-11-30 20:08:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SharonWilcox13 @newsmax WHY?  Are the recounts being done on Dominion machines which were just reprogrammed yesterday?  I think that it is time to send in the troops (figuratively speaking).
1333380642407530497 2020-11-30 20:01:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TrueTheVote @MyDogIsCoffee Why are recounts being run on Dominion hardware?  That is just reproducing the fraud.
1333380089677942784 2020-11-30 19:59:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wyn17Plus @yardonna If true, a lot of people are going to hang.  If true, US military killed while securing a CIA run operation.  This needs to be substantiated or repudiated.
1333379428890464258 2020-11-30 19:56:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bfraser747 @QuintonWard10 Not really.  Who would count the votes?
1333378619503067138 2020-11-30 19:53:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @X14Eagle @blp3 @borderObserver I support our truckers and their fight for America and their industry.
1333372425535295493 2020-11-30 19:28:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto Guess the reprogramming worked.
1333186812957708288 2020-11-30 07:11:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced Do people vote for it or is it election fraud?
1333163644494901248 2020-11-30 05:39:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @crt39437 @JennaEllisEsq Love the in your face America Cheat.  PA Supreme Court - You can't file suit before the election because there is no fraud committed at that time so no damage and you can't file suit after the election because it is too late and you should have filed timely before the election.
1333162049669451778 2020-11-30 05:32:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Adorable_Todd @hrkbenowen @nayvee99 As I type Dominion is busy wiping the machines clean.
1333161453826707456 2020-11-30 05:30:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FrankLuntz So you think that the election fraud will hold and China and Iran will get their money's worth while the Elites here turn the country into a Marxist dictatorship?
1333160761699364865 2020-11-30 05:27:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto @lolofav I think another judge just reversed that.  GA needs to erase all proof of fraud as quickly as possible.
1333160140703375360 2020-11-30 05:25:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @heatherjones333 Is it to soon to call Harris the President Elect?
1333155405925666823 2020-11-30 05:06:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LukeNor47774158 @CXWorlds @TheRISEofROD Heard it.  Like the tweet, this has not been verified although I believe Flynn and McInerney  If true, we are looking at treason with strong CIA participation.  It would imply that the United States is under attack by forces foreign and DOMESTIC.
1333154155750326272 2020-11-30 05:01:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CXWorlds @MARILYN19556 @TheRISEofROD At this point we are all helpless observers.  I think only a few know what is actually going on.  The only thing that is clear is that there was massive Democrat election fraud on many levels and in many ways.  It is a good bet that China, Iran, and our Elites were involved.
1333150643041701888 2020-11-30 04:47:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DeeLilacs @mechester2016 As an Arizona resident, I feel raped. As an American, I feel assaulted.  Democrat Election Fraud in my state.  Unacceptable.  Not only did Trump win, but I would bet a bundle that McSally did as well.  China Kelly is not Arizona  I want the parties responsible arrested for fraud.
1333148956952469504 2020-11-30 04:40:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @_NCPatriot_ @BIZPACReview Hey, think Kelly really won in Arizona?  https://t.co/vryofqL3GO

1333147992405073920 2020-11-30 04:37:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @davidchapman141 @Hoya97 The machines modify and allocate vote counts.  They do not give a pure count as you would believe.  The machines can be set to add to the count without votes.  And a lot of other dirty sh!t.  All this can be seen by an investigation of the machines.
1333146931636310016 2020-11-30 04:32:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @OldielocksNmo4 @Hootentown2 Is this a real picture?
1333143327412166658 2020-11-30 04:18:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MattBraynard @FBI PS - The @FBI has an immense budget, extensive resources, and the weight of the gov't behind it.    Why does it have to come to you for research of Democrat Election Fraud?
1333142600501526528 2020-11-30 04:15:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MattBraynard We respect you. We even made a contribution for your effort.  But we don't buy that there is anyone in the @FBI who is fighting of the Constitution and America.  Rotten apples hires rotten apples.  The agency needs to be totally gutted and an honest one constructed on its bones.
1333141586570477568 2020-11-30 04:11:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @woman3290 @Wyntre999 @SidneyPowell1 @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani A judge just issued an order that the machines cannot be updated and must be preserved.  Time for a mysterious fire at the warehouse.
1333140875866632192 2020-11-30 04:08:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DavidJHarrisJr @SidneyPowell1 @LLinWood @GenFlynn @PhillDKline Does anyone think that the Democrats will obey a court order?  My guess is that they will wipe the machines to bury the evidence.
1333140631372275712 2020-11-30 04:07:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jsolomonReports Will the @FBI be working with the Democrat Party of fraud to bury the evidence?
1333139625406128130 2020-11-30 04:03:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bryan700 Someone has to make room for the illegals.
1333139293871644672 2020-11-30 04:02:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @indacopa @Squirrels_Mama Of course Biden was in on it.  Getting elected is his get out of jail free card.  He is mostly gone and is just following orders, but that is as much as he can do.
1333088274567495680 2020-11-30 00:39:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HoneyFitz93 @gatewaypundit Has this been verified?
1333087801655521280 2020-11-30 00:37:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> So as I understand it the PA, Democrat fraudist, Supreme Court ruled against Trump before the election because he could not show damage before votes were cast and then they ruled against him after the election because it was to late for him to file.  Democrats are Corrupt Garbage

Will we see a war between the American military on one side &amp; the CIA, FBI, and DOJ on the other?  Why did Trump terminate "many" Deep Staters in &amp; about the military?
1333011630171439104 2020-11-29 19:35:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @superyayadize @FriendlyJMC Question of the Day:  Will the Democrats get away with massive election fraud and thereby destroy our country, our lives, and our childrens future?
1333010431971979264 2020-11-29 19:30:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EmeraldRobinson @honorablemdwife No way Kelly won Arizona.  How many elections were tainted.  Is Pelosi the "legal" Speaker of the House?
1333009320498262018 2020-11-29 19:26:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Good morning.  We are watching the Democrat Party trying to take over our country through massive election fraud.  Hard to believe that if there is enough corruption to carry the crime out, our country may be gone, a sad day for America, a great day for China and Iran.
1332845022518018049 2020-11-29 08:33:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump I remember that guy (who can forget a name like Creamer) for videos in 2016 when he was nailed talking about fixing the election for Hillary through illegal means.  How is that guy still on the street?
1332843683863924737 2020-11-29 08:27:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bubblebathgirl According to @FoxNews, the evidence of voter fraud that you are seeing being delivered in bushel baskets never happened.
1332843290341691394 2020-11-29 08:26:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @USArmy @MINationalGuard I wonder how many of these people had their votes stolen by the Democrats.
1332842749855350784 2020-11-29 08:24:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @spanglesvi The whole world knows that the Democrats are engaged in massive Election Fraud.  China and Iran approve.

I am surprised that @ScottPresler 's tweet did not have a "!" and the statement to the effect that some people disagree with the statement that death threats by leftists are wrong.

1332801387642593280 2020-11-29 05:39:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Just checking in to see if the Democrats defrauded the country out of anything else today.

1332674260960124928 2020-11-28 21:14:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrMichaelBurkes @ZimmermanWatts Everyone.  Democrats believe that the ends justify the means so are OK with it.
1332673957221130242 2020-11-28 21:13:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RepRWilliams @toby_dorena By promising amnesty to those here illegally, we are providing a ready made army for riots and chaos when the massive Democrat Election Fraud is defeated.  Same with the student loan crap.  Can you say coup?
1332673480668561408 2020-11-28 21:11:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Purrpatrol No one thinks that Biden himself is any more than barely aware of his surroundings and what happens around him.  The massive election fraud was carried out by the people that will actually run the country when the steal is completed.  Biden just agreed to keep out of jail.
1332672120715788288 2020-11-28 21:06:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @thehill @thehill is a bunch of hacks.  Question, how can you overturn something that was not won?  They would say that recovering stolen property from a thief was taking his stuff.
1332671596914372608 2020-11-28 21:04:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AZGOP @DianaBialkowski What can be done about the massive Democrat Election Fraud in AZ that proports to have elected Kelly?
1332671012274540544 2020-11-28 21:01:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Reuters Apparently in an ultimate act of revenge and evil, he is going to put all of Iran's resources behind #BidenCheated2020 and the massive Democrat Election Fraud to be sure of America's death.
1332668274601906182 2020-11-28 20:50:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @the_exception @RosarioReynos10 Who is the moron judge in PA who said that there was no indication of election fraud?

Elite - Kerry, Soros, Clinton, Bloomberg, Pelosi, and on and on and on.  Add China and Iran which function as American elites.  Block.
1332666434489520129 2020-11-28 20:43:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @natemax @realDonaldTrump Back at you.  No political and criminal mercy when the massive Democrat Election Fraud fails.
1332666059183194112 2020-11-28 20:42:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JerryBarmash @realDonaldTrump PA judge just delayed the Certification and Legislature will provide electors for Trump based on the significant (tip of the iceberg) evidence presented that you seem to have missed.  You are likely in a NY Marxist fog.  PS - Any idea where the Dominion Antifa guy is hiding?
1332664860086128643 2020-11-28 20:37:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RSBNetwork @realDonaldTrump Past Elections were based on:  Issues Values Candidates Truth, Justice, Freedom, &amp; the American way.  This one has only one focal point.  Can the Democrats get away with massive ELECTION FRAUD and by doing so take over the country for the benefit of a few elites &amp; foreign powers?
1332664008265015296 2020-11-28 20:33:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump Hey @twitter, you may want to remove your BS warning.  A judge in PA just put off the certification based on the likelihood that #BidenCheated2020 , #BidenCheated, #BidenCheats or the other 100 hashtags your are suppressing.  Democrat Election Fraud is real.
1332662584126758912 2020-11-28 20:28:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RobbersonJon True about the ownership?  It is clear that Feinstein is a agent of China and has been for most of her career.
1332658021005070338 2020-11-28 20:10:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @rose_unplugged In true @Twitter manner after #BidenCheated trended for a while all of a sudden it stopped auto completing and switched to other things.  #BidenCheats is one.  This is a clear demonstration of how they cheat.
1332656653024444419 2020-11-28 20:04:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @liquidlaugh They have done more than the FBI &amp; DOJ combined.  Why do we spend billions to fund those agencies?

1332488755505106944 2020-11-28 08:57:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> #BidenCheated   Sad day when the election does not revolve around issues but rather if the Democrats will get away with massive Election Fraud and illegally seize control of the government.  Everyone knows they cheated.  Most Democrats sheeple are OK with it.

1332485574062608385 2020-11-28 08:44:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal Hollywood needs to sell more tickets in its prime market, China.
1332459999499493378 2020-11-28 07:03:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Lukewearechange The fat one in the middle could feed the city for a week.  Just kidding of course, but it could happen if the Democrats take power.  Look at Venezuela.  NM is closing grocery stores and people are standing in lines for food for hours (occupancy limits) where stores are open.

1332431342651408386 2020-11-28 05:09:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenMastriano @scott_helmick Apparently the PA Appeals court found nothing suspicious about this.

A moron is a terrible thing and an actor with an nasty opinion is an insult to fans, an actor spewing political rubbish is a moronic insult.

There is no way that Biden won Arizoan (I am an Arizona resident).  The difference is 4,000 votes and Biden likely stole hundreds of thousands.   To our state legislators, I believe that Kelly did not win either.  PS - I, my family, &amp; my friends vote.
1332428432697819136 2020-11-28 04:57:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @OANN Some of the best minds in the Democrat legal stable will be searching for typos in the filing.

1332427877837488128 2020-11-28 04:55:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RepBarbaraLee You don't cancel student debt, you just get other people to pay for it.  The people who benefited from their educations pay nothing and the people who did not pays for everything.  That is a crock.
1332427203859017728 2020-11-28 04:52:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @scott_helmick We have a @TheJusticeDept , who knew.  Seriously, massive Democrat Election Fraud with participation of foreign entities as but not limited to China and Iran and our @FBI and DOJ are missing in action.  We pay untold billions each year for agencies tasked with protecting America.

Arizona is down to 4,000 votes and no doubt will be Trump as well with the only question being did Kelly win?  That is 264 for Trump with WI, MI, GA, and NV left and law suits in all.

1332354969719033857 2020-11-28 00:05:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SmallBiz4Trump @JoshShapiroPA Lets start at basics.  Was your election the result of massive Election Fraud (both times)?  I believe the guy is dirty and is using his office to defraud the American People and steal the election.
1332353673456803845 2020-11-28 00:00:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ennykinpa @FoxNews claims that there was no election fraud.  Maybe @tuckercarlson will do a show on how 350% turnout is OK.
1332353096400310272 2020-11-27 23:58:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump If you do not govern by the consent of the people, you are not a Constitutional Republic but rather a Marxist Dictatorship.  Massive Democrat Election fraud is not consent.  Will America slide quietly into rule by despot?
1332351962566643713 2020-11-27 23:53:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dhiggins63 @TheDemocrats Truth.  What do you think will be the effect on America's black (and legal Latino) citizens if Biden legalizes millions of illegals, opens our borders to millions more, &amp; puts them on government assistance?  Millions of unskilled workers will destroy communities &amp; people.
1332349966820335621 2020-11-27 23:46:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> The Democrats engaged in massive Election Fraud.  They disenfranchised the American people.  Except for a few morons, everyone knows although the leftists applaud this method of take over.  The question remains, will they get away with the Steal?  Will America disappear?
1332348960002904065 2020-11-27 23:42:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @willchamberlain These people in China felt the same way as you.  Briefly.  https://t.co/WQKVtbmcpk

1332344900109516805 2020-11-27 23:25:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cain_nate @gatewaypundit So while our military is overseas risking life and limb for pitiful wages, the Democrats at home are stealing their vote.  Democrats are not the swamp, they are a steaming putrid pile of 💩.
1332343627784175618 2020-11-27 23:20:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @danprimack It hurts a Marxist liberal to see families enjoying a holiday together, their hate, despair, and surety that they are losers builds into a rage that embraces primordial evil realized in the desire to destroy everything good.
1332342701732163585 2020-11-27 23:17:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CuteScarley It is bad enough that 2 Million Dead People are registered to vote, but worse is that Biden got 6 Million Votes from them of which 4 Million were signed and dated.

So where does that leave us as a country governed by the consent of the people.  No one consents to fraud.
1332296504342499329 2020-11-27 20:13:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @stillgray I can't speak for anyone else, but @TuckerCarlson is beginning to remind me of him.  Once mainstream, once very sucessful, turned into lie and crazy land and never came back.

1332085175933571073 2020-11-27 06:13:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @willbarrett_1 Chief Justice Roberts in his minority dissent also said that the Supreme Court was irrelevant.  Looks like mass murderer Cuomo and Roberts are on the same wave length.  Roberts is a gift from Bush.

1332065133149843457 2020-11-27 04:54:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DineshDSouza Bush nominated him.  Need further explanation?
1332064720812007425 2020-11-27 04:52:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RedRising11 @MariaSMBII Not so fast.  In his dissent, Roberts said that Cuomo did not have to follow the decision.  Now isn't that some 💩.  The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court said that the courts decision did not have to be followed.  Satan / Evil have a lot of fight left.
1332063007539564546 2020-11-27 04:45:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @eugenedelgaudio @madepilita When twitter falls, there will be some, very once highly paid, people scrambling for $ 15 / hr. jobs for which they do not qualify.  Once this massive Democrat Election Fraud issue is resolved, the people who haven't done so already will bail from twitter &amp; the company will tank.
1332061895189094400 2020-11-27 04:41:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SolidRedPeon @madepilita So Roberts in his minority opinion stated that the majority opinion may be ignored.  WTF?
1332061225476259840 2020-11-27 04:38:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mattreiter42 @cvpayne Yeah, that is a billion dollars of tax payer money.  I wonder how much the politicians and bureaucrats skimmed off of the top.
1332060847875579905 2020-11-27 04:37:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Rothbard1776 @SidneyPowell1 The Democrat Election Fraud depended on extremely corrupt officials (like in PA) and the fact that the crime was so obvious was expected to make no difference in the final certification.
1332059965457002497 2020-11-27 04:33:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SolidRedPeon @madepilita I think that Cuomo just said something to the effect of screw the Supreme Court.  I wonder if he is going to defy it's legal ruling or if he is all mouth.  That would be sweet.

1332056865643982848 2020-11-27 04:21:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sioxielegend @stillgray I think that is part of what got Trump during his first four years.  Who could comprehend the great and wide depth of evil that has become our faceless government and the elites that run it?  Trump knew, but it took time to really process and comprehend it.

1332054036200058880 2020-11-27 04:10:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @truth_sniper @TruthEqsJustice Is the Governor and AG of GA supporting China and Iran in their attack on the United States?  If so, that is treason.  Same for their counterparts in PA.

Four justices, including Roberts, ruled against #1A and the freedom of religion in favor of edicts by a tin pot dictator.  It is clear that the constitution and American Freedoms have no meaning to the Marxists in the court who worship not God.

1331984192775753730 2020-11-26 23:32:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kayleighmcenany True.  But sadly four justices, including Roberts, ruled against Freedom of Religion and for the "states" power to strike God from our lives.
1331980544112951297 2020-11-26 23:18:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @pvtjokerus Apparently Bush appointee Chief Justice Roberts disagrees and feels that the Constitution does not protect the practice of religion but rather that the state has the authority to curtail such endeavors.  Roberts is a manifestation of Bush's evil.

1331951460448305154 2020-11-26 21:22:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AmericaJapan01 If you enforce unconstitutional edicts of tin pot would be dictators, you cause harm to your community.  Police need to step back, recognize that we are at war, and decide what side they are on.  Many are beginning to do so.  These two have made the wrong choice.
1331950610107691016 2020-11-26 21:19:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WEMcCormick Marxists and Democrats do not recognize the validity of court orders that they do not like.

1331948396626657288 2020-11-26 21:10:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Natalia01Mateo @robertamary23 It is so sad.  The 2020 election &amp; fate of America does not depend on the issues of the day &amp; the will of the people.  It hinges on whether or not the Democrat Party and Candidates can get away with MASSIVE ELECTION FRAUD.  The premise of America is the consent of the governed
1331947088423256064 2020-11-26 21:05:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Lrihendry @LyleAnderson3 I am with you and think your husband is wrong.  It is time to stop pampering and coddling those that will destroy our country and way of life either because they are complete fools or evil.  Democrats hate us and deserve no kindness in return.
1331945734707453952 2020-11-26 20:59:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto @BeachDreamin291 It is noted that Roberts sided with the court's Marxists to attack religion as part of the minority dissent.
1331945244602949632 2020-11-26 20:57:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BlustrmomX2 Is being pro American and fighting for an honest election result against the @twitter TOS?  Asking for a friend.

Filing in NV accepted.  I think that this has just begun and Rudy is great and the team in on track.  PS - Trump did make some bad appointments, but he has learned.
1331755780144414720 2020-11-26 08:24:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec Imagine him as gov of PA.  The state would experience a rebirth.

After watching the tale and facts of the massive Democrat Election Fraud in the 2020 election unfold, I understand.

Would not take much of an audit to send Biden packing.  I would look toward an audit to see if McSally won.  No way my state elected a skumb@g like Kelly.

1331720478256369669 2020-11-26 06:04:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SpringSteps Just when you think you have gotten away with Massive Democrat Election Fraud, along comes a judge and says NO.  As we listened to hours of testimony of Democrat Cheating in PA at the Senate Committee hearing, we learned that the PA congress can tell Wolf to pound a lump.
1331719446818217985 2020-11-26 06:00:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CassyWearsHeels @may_talcott LOL, after listening to Biden's plans they may want to return to their own country.
1331718924954603521 2020-11-26 05:58:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Concern09017991 @davis_levin Good to find out that the Dominion System is in PA solely on the orders of Wolf.  Indeed, his bank accounts need to be looked at closely.  Was he guaranteed reelection by Dominion, the vote counter.  Was Wolf really elected the first time?  He needs to see the inside of a jail.
1331717790340825088 2020-11-26 05:53:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BreitbartNews How much election fraud did it take to get those two reelected?

1331716632096346112 2020-11-26 05:49:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JoshShapiroPA How much Election Fraud did it take to put you over the top?  I thought a judge stopped the certification.  Did I miss something or are you lying again?  Bye the way, the PA Senate hearing was grand.  You may have some eyes on you very soon.
1331716043429928961 2020-11-26 05:47:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AZGOP @kelliwardaz I hope someday I will get the oppertunity to vote for @kelliwardaz.
1331715823233236992 2020-11-26 05:46:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @edwrather And so with a number of any states.  Does anyone seriously think Biden or Kelly won in Arizona?  Biden is now down to a 4,000 vote lead with the discovery of another (so many) counting glitch.  And this is before the massive Democrat Election Fraud and Dominion are touched.

The Democrats / RINOs / MSM / Deep State / Elites do not care about you so they will put the blame on you.

1331663214963085312 2020-11-26 02:17:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @pepesgrandma So that is what happened to Trumps 700,000 vote lead at 3:00AM the morning after the count was halted.

There is a multitude of significant allegations of Democrat Election Fraud.  Either of you going to do a segment on @FoxNews calling AZ for Biden with 7 votes counted?
1331608099908591617 2020-11-25 22:38:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrD81344553 So you are sitting at home watching your children cry because they are hungry.  What would you do?

It clarifies that other frauds done at the same time but not caught are not "upload errors".  Just kidding, they left that out even though it is true.
1331592098106118144 2020-11-25 21:34:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WayneDupreeShow Arizona is down to a 4,000 vote differenced with hearings scheduled and accusations of massive Democrat Election Fraud.  Powell stated affidavit of Dominion rigging  @FoxNews called Arizona after 7 (or maybe a few more) votes were counted.  Fox deserves to go down and not get up.

1331586756714500097 2020-11-25 21:13:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Toneman807 @may_talcott You left out AZ where Biden's "lead" is down to 4,000 and substantial allagations of massive Democrat Election Fraud are being voiced.   Dominion head start of votes for Dems, Dominion fake counts, illegals voting, dead voting, illegal requests for mail in ballots, etc.

Many Democrats so believe.  Any Marxist rule, if the crime holds, will be by force and not through the consent of the people.
1331582036943933441 2020-11-25 20:54:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @roxyloveslucy @gatewaypundit PS - This little gem was in the article;  "underlying Android operating system", said Eric Coomer of Dominion Voting System  Android is @Google, so China's best friend also had a hand in our vote counting.  What flaws did they build into the version of Andriod for Dominion?
1331581439666634753 2020-11-25 20:52:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @roxyloveslucy @gatewaypundit I think that Raffensperger needs a close look.  He sounds as dirty as all get out and very likely was deeply involved in the massive Democrat Election Fraud in GA (yes RINOs can be bought).
1331579730194169861 2020-11-25 20:45:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @roxyloveslucy @gatewaypundit With a 4,000 vote lead before any of the massive Democrat Election Fraud is considered, Biden will not take Arizona, a state he lost badly  I would like to look at the Senate and other races.  There is now way a skumbag like Kelly won here especially with large Trump honest votes
1331578287512961027 2020-11-25 20:39:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Jackk_Burton @lonestarebel @BreitbartNews I will leave you with a scary thought.  If the massive Democrat Election Fraud holds, Soros will essentially be controlling the United States and each and everyone of our lives through puppet Democrats.
1331577864647364610 2020-11-25 20:37:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Jackk_Burton @lonestarebel @BreitbartNews How about this one.  Soros described his younger days when he was stripping &amp; looting fellow Jews for the Nazis as they were put on box cars &amp; sent to their deaths as his happiest days.  Does his hatred for &amp; desire to destroy America stem from our defeating his beloved Nazis?  https://t.co/lzt2fBuEbv
1331571602958340096 2020-11-25 20:13:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Alyssa_Milano FU.  I have a recommendation as to where you can put your stick   Massive Democrat Election Fraud us not the thing on which peace is built after 4 years of being attacked without pause.
1331416403467878402 2020-11-25 09:56:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JosephRuimy @ResidentOfFL You are wrong.  Just today incorrectly tabulated votes were found and Biden now leads by 4,000 votes.  Arizona was subject to massive Democrat Election Fraud.  I do not believe that Kelly won.
1331394734560985088 2020-11-25 08:30:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Lrihendry @Ajax2847 The Maricopa County Director needs to go to jail.    Signed  Maricopa County Voter
1331392732850372609 2020-11-25 08:22:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @keck553 @may_talcott And yet the law enforcement 900,200 split, was 1,750,000 for Biden and 62,000 for Trump.  This count was the official record certified on Dominion Voting Machines.
1331379611075104770 2020-11-25 07:30:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CodeMonkeyZ I, as a Maricopa Voter, demand a recount (by hand with GOP observers) and an audit.  This is beyond the pale.
1331378888543326208 2020-11-25 07:27:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @chuckwoolery Good deal.  Now when is he going to address the massive Democrat Election Fraud?

1331367426554904581 2020-11-25 06:41:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AndrewYang Sometimes you lose and commit massive Democrat Election Fraud and then claim you won and then whine, cry, and sic the MSM on the real winner because he will not accept the Steal.

1331366653565648897 2020-11-25 06:38:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto I thought that they already certified the results.  WTF is going on?  I think it is great.  Biden is now down to about 4,000 in Arizona a state that he never could, would or did win.  We will see what comes of it.

1331286792637607936 2020-11-25 01:21:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JesseKellyDC Bull Shit.  Let me repeat myself 🐂💩.  Fraud or not at least half the country did not go the polls &amp; vote for Biden, as a matter of fact much less than half.  Basing a conclusion on "fraud or not" is lame, weak, &amp; just plain dumb.  I envy you your peace with the Marxist takeover

Why the voting dead &amp; voting illegals?  Why harvesting from the sick and elderly?  Truth is the tech giants fooled no one.

If there was fraud in the electronic count of ballots, we should take our time and get to the bottom of it.  Like sometime during Biden's 2nd term. 2. If Google, twitter, facebook, the MSM...

1331248853279010823 2020-11-24 22:50:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump In 2024, @foxnews will declare the Democrat Candidate the victor a week before the voting starts and be correct.  By that time, the machine of Democrat Election Fraud will be nailed into place and we will be a third world country ruled by elitist tin pots.
1331247371565535232 2020-11-24 22:44:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @grindingdude If the media &amp; big tech swung the race to Biden, why did they have to falsify the counts using Dominion &amp; other machines, stop the count &amp; sneak in truckloads of bogus ballots in the wee hours, have the dead vote &amp; illegals vote, multiple votes, etc.?  People saw through them.
1331245646200782848 2020-11-24 22:37:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @roxyloveslucy @gatewaypundit @TuckerCarlson is feeding us a crock of cold gruel in the pretense of nourishing us.  "We need to take as long as it takes".  Does that mean the entire Biden Presidency to find out he won by fraud?  It was rigged because Google fed us bad information.  No, it was rigged by fraud.
1331244550422106113 2020-11-24 22:33:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GenFlynn @TuckerCarlson @SidneyPowell1 @RudyGiuliani @jbinnall @JennaEllisEsq @tracybeanz @marklevinshow @LLinWood @MariaBartiromo @PressSec @seanhannity One also has to consider how effective the Google, Facebook, Twitter, &amp; MSM actions were in the light of the fact that at least five states had to stop counting, fake water main breaks, and then slip in hundreds of thousands (millions) of fraudulent ballots in the wee hours.
1331234623934713858 2020-11-24 21:54:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GenFlynn @TuckerCarlson @SidneyPowell1 @RudyGiuliani @jbinnall @JennaEllisEsq @tracybeanz @marklevinshow @LLinWood @MariaBartiromo @PressSec @seanhannity Don't be fooled, this is complete misdirection &amp; may not be the truth.  The simple TRUTH is that Trump won the election by a massive vote margin &amp; the election was turned by Massive Democrat Fraud.  Google did not turn the election, Fraud did.  And Fraud, cheat is actionable.
1331229533366673408 2020-11-24 21:33:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @rider_of_Dstorm Wow, hard to believe that 50% are still watching @FoxNews.
1331229198141194248 2020-11-24 21:32:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LouDobbs No.  The @FBI and @TheJusticeDept are compromised beyond repair.  Most are traitors to the Republic and an enemy of the state.
1331016837631361024 2020-11-24 07:28:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Democrat election fraud fueled by elitist &amp; Chinese money.  We will see if the Supreme Court allows the law to be bent to unrecognizable &amp; the country destroyed.  If it fails, we will see what comes next.  A government seated as this cannot govern with the consent of the people.
1330999550333444096 2020-11-24 06:19:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JWSNMNJ @RedWingGrips You missed something and they did.
1330999098334273538 2020-11-24 06:18:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GrahamAllen_1 @marsha9753 They apparently feel that they can ignore the concept that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed &amp; feel that they can hold power through the exercise of force.    The will of the people thus becomes meaningless.  God given rights are forfeit.
1330997469375696896 2020-11-24 06:11:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @USMCMIL03 So which country is first to Mattis?

1330990738109128706 2020-11-24 05:44:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> The founders of our loved country in the Declaration of Independence stressed the idea of government, "..deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.."  A government seated through election fraud with the aid of enemies domestic and foreign has no right to govern.
1330987581400440832 2020-11-24 05:32:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @heatherjones333 So people have two days to stock up before a one day suspension of sales.  WTF is that stupidity?
1330983711953731584 2020-11-24 05:17:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joshdcaplan So they shut down counting when Trump was 700,000 votes ahead, sneaked in truckloads of ballots in the wee hours of the morning, would not let anyone watch the ballot count, and tallied the "votes" on Dominion machines.  OK, sounds about right to me.
1330983148365041664 2020-11-24 05:14:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BarnettforAZ Also effects the Senator election.  Now way a scumbag like Kelly won Arizona.

1330925523397087233 2020-11-24 01:25:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lisamurkowski What a crock.  There is no faith in the electoral system because EVERYONE, even the public deniers, know that is based on massive Democrat Election Fraud aided by RINOs like you.  A government that does not govern by consent of the people is a dictatorship.
1330924356323528705 2020-11-24 01:21:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LABeachGal1 Perhaps they plan on sending Antifa / BLM to take our guns.  Or are they going to have the police take our guns and then get rid of them.
1330916033855590400 2020-11-24 00:48:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @may_talcott Not clear.  But it looks possible.

1330879368273412098 2020-11-23 22:22:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LJSpagnoli So If I commit fraud and then dispute the people that call me out for committing fraud will @twitter lable the people who are accusing me as being disputed.
1330878145306640387 2020-11-23 22:17:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KelemenCari Absolute truth.  At best, we are a Marxist dictatorship with rule enforced by force of arms.  The American gov't governs by the consent of the people and massive Democrat Election Fraud is not such consent.  The American Revolution was based on taxation without representation.
1330866537272524802 2020-11-23 21:31:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @heatherjones333 Dear @twitter we have all seen the numbers and there are more voter in some Democrat run swing states than registered voters.  Some by a lot.  So you may want to remove that warning that the claim is disputed unless you are comfortable with lying by misrepresentation to customers
1330866034748710913 2020-11-23 21:29:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Pouissant1 Dobbs is great and I believe true as they come, but he cannot control everything even on his own show.  That statement on the bottom of the screen was BS.
1330865198039584774 2020-11-23 21:26:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JebBush 🐂💩   How many votes were done directly on voting machines without a paper trail???  Who tabulated the recount &amp; what ballots were used in the recount?  Seems like mystery ballots are appearing all the time.  Shredding?  Was recount? fudged to agree with Dominion results?
1330862104090349569 2020-11-23 21:13:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced This is starting to happen, but more is needed.  It comes down to the point where police have three choices.  1. Quit, 2. Stand up for their communities, the American People, and the constitution, or 3. Follow Orders (used after WWII) of tin pot Democrat (RINO) dictators.

1330853136454479877 2020-11-23 20:38:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SaraCarterDC PS - If the norm of the country is election fraud by the Democrat Party and bought RINOs who use the gov't to enrich themselves and cronies at the cost of the people, then I say it is time someone set that back.
1330852673382346754 2020-11-23 20:36:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SaraCarterDC Really?  I don't feel united.  I feel hated and cheated and the victim of massive Democrat Election Fraud.  I feel that a corrupt incompetent is being illegally pushed into the WH by forces that want the destruction of America.  Biden does not have the consent of the people.
1330851875323744258 2020-11-23 20:33:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @hrkbenowen Would you leave your young daughter unatteded with Biden?  Some questions are no brainers.
1330851593546174465 2020-11-23 20:32:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SaraCarterDC @SidneyPowell1 @WSJ The Trump Campaign did not distance itself.  It simply stated that Sidney Powell is not a member of the Legal Team, "officially".  Such status allows her independence in pursuit of the truth, prosecution for the truth, and raising of funds separate from Trump to attain her goals.
1330836767662981120 2020-11-23 19:33:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @spectatorindex Please wait, this poll is being recounted on Dominion machines in Germany by people in Spain and the results will flip.

1330683937257971714 2020-11-23 09:25:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CarmineSabia To allow her to work independently without Trump being questioned every inch of the way for her actions.  I would bet any amount of money that she has the evidence claimed and a lot more.
1330682856528441345 2020-11-23 09:21:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RyanAFournier @deplorablejjb So what is a governor who is ignored going to do?

If she was part of the team, the Democrat Election Fraud Crew and their MSM arse lickers would claim he was directing her actions.
1330674387280773120 2020-11-23 08:47:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Devoguido @RealMattCouch Are you saying that the US military will be bombing American cities?
1330673951043776516 2020-11-23 08:46:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealMattCouch The Chinese demonstrated what a Marxist revolution is really about.  https://t.co/aHM93rau5G
1330671912192671746 2020-11-23 08:38:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @123RHGreen @CarolChupp I found one way of not gettiing lied to is to not watch anything on @Foxnews.
1330671079551946753 2020-11-23 08:34:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SM4USA @tcraig57 One question, who has the authority to order / approve a special forces raid on a company (reputably tied to the CIA) in Germany and secure their servers?
1330668415338520576 2020-11-23 08:24:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mpatt70 @SidneyPowell1 Is she on Parler?
1330644119090126850 2020-11-23 06:47:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JoeShikhman @papa_sissy Per other tweets, he is also connected to Romney.
1330642296233107456 2020-11-23 06:40:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced You should, your garbage man is more honest and of greater value to society.
1330638915267485697 2020-11-23 06:26:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BlueSky_Report Hmmm.  I wonder who in the United States has the authority to order a US military raid in Germany.
1330637915987210240 2020-11-23 06:22:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BlueSky_Report China owns the patentes on the software used to count our votes in Germany and @TuckerCarlson  is not sure there is a problem.
1330637606137131008 2020-11-23 06:21:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BlueSky_Report So China owns the patents on the software used to count American votes?
1330637248962850817 2020-11-23 06:20:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BlueSky_Report @SidneyPowell1 Isn't HSBC the bank tied into the laundering of drug money and gotten off of the hook with a fine an no criminal charges by Comey, Mueller, and Lynch among others.  Or do I have the wrong criminal organization operating as a bank.   https://t.co/Qzp9aiMg6L  PS - China connection?
1330635876209029120 2020-11-23 06:14:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BlueSky_Report @zeusFanHouse So Antifa was counting our votes in Germany in a CIA location while the company's Canada headquarters was next door to Soros offices.  Wow, just wow!  And strangely, the MSM is covering it all up.  Wow, just wow!  Nothing to see here, move along.  Wow, just wow!

Just because the judge was appointed by Trump does not mean he isn't as corrupt as any Obama judge.  Trump, on advice, did make some bad appointments.

1330632126874611712 2020-11-23 05:59:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrAmericanPatr1 @wmmII88 If that is true, it is all over for Kemp &amp; the Massive Democrat Election Fraud must be voided.  The American government governs by the consent of  the people.  Election Steal will not cut it.    That is China / foreign interference in the election process &amp; will not be tolerated.
1330608777058426881 2020-11-23 04:27:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @may_talcott I clicked yes, but what is the use.  Like Social Media they will lie and they will get away with it.
1330608429883277312 2020-11-23 04:25:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bakoff333 @williamlharbuck Agree, @foxnews has become @CNN lite to me.
1330608295564906496 2020-11-23 04:25:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tracybeanz If the Steal goes through, there will be no gov't.  No consent of the people.
1330608135011110917 2020-11-23 04:24:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @may_talcott The IRS will take your property and assets by having banks throw a couple of switches.  They will use force to enforce their edicts and evict you from your home, take your job, and steal your money.  At that time all hell will break lose.
1330607518477815808 2020-11-23 04:22:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @perfectsliders That is step 1.  Step 2. no matter which way the Supreme Court goes should be interesting.  Left will riot if the Steal is stopped.  If Biden gets the benefit of massive Democrat Election Fraud we will have an illegitimated President not empowered by the consent of the people.

1330600978458951680 2020-11-23 03:56:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @American1299 And very unwatched.  Payoff anyone?
1330569303830085633 2020-11-23 01:50:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dcexaminer 2/2  Why did Dominion close their Canada &amp; Denver offices? Why have the Dominion employees scrubbed the internet &amp; disappeared? Why did they back out of Pennsylvania hearing? What happened in Germany? Where were the votes counted? What about the Antifa guy?  @FoxNews asked nil?
1330568367179141121 2020-11-23 01:46:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dcexaminer 1/2  Actually who the phuck is he?  Is he a Dominion (long term) employee? Is he a Clinton blessed attorney sent in to spread the word?  Where is his proof?  Hey, Tucker what says you. Where is the interview push back. Where are the questions.
1330567453408038912 2020-11-23 01:42:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dcexaminer Dominion (or Clinton legal) guy looks good over the @foxnews logo.  Has @twitter put a disclaimer that the fraud company's spokesman is disputed by Americans?
1330566569655558144 2020-11-23 01:39:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @9NEWSNANCY @glennbeck Leave it to @FoxNews to put on some lying turkey to bull shit us about Dominion's part in the massive Democrat Election Fraud.  Is this guy a Dominion employee or one of Clinton's legal beagles trained liars?  Has @tuckercarlson challenged his statements yet?
1330565675073433601 2020-11-23 01:35:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @unscriptedmike Kemp better cut a deal quick.

1330547540123668480 2020-11-23 00:23:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Sundncefn @kimfreethinker @POTUS And what if he proves the claims? Is the left going to bow to Cheney's opinion?  This is not DC bullsh!t any longer.  This is the life of every American Citizen and the future of their family.  Cheney will not be dumpster diving for food as in Venezuela.  The rest of us will.
1330546260659609601 2020-11-23 00:18:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @USMCMIL03 If the Democrats hold the steal, the resistance will be real and the country will not obey the Democrat Fraud Elite.  Reminds me of how the Revolution began.  A gov't that rules by fraud &amp; force does not govern with the consent of the people.
1330477541321105408 2020-11-22 19:45:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @politico Ever get the feeling that a lot of money is changing hands and a lot of favors being promised?

From Germany?  From Cuba?  From anywhere in the world?  Er, no someone(s) were paid off bigly for that.

1330284299136999424 2020-11-22 06:57:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @snarkybeach @cannoneerfour Possible, but who can know now that we understand the deep and pervasive criminal activities of the Democrat Party.  At this point, it is impossible to accept any election result where Democrats (or bought RINOs)  have control.

1330279623284973573 2020-11-22 06:39:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @snarkybeach @cannoneerfour Did New Yorkers vote for that or were their votes counted on Dominion machines?  How much Democrat Election Fraud did it take to make DeBlasio mayor?
1330277360650825735 2020-11-22 06:30:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lynn_weiser Another poll said that over 30% of Democrats believe that the Democrat Election Fraud cartel stole the election.  If I combine that with most Republicans, I get more that almost half.  Stop with the garbage polls already.
1330275968326508544 2020-11-22 06:24:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @justin_hart PS - Next move will likely be the Sheriff sending in the riot squad with body armor and automatic weapons.  That is how tin pots work.
1330274983344545793 2020-11-22 06:20:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @justin_hart The police are under attack by the Democrats and their storm troopers BLM / Antifa.  Can anyone explain why the police of Buffalo NY are attacking the community (people just trying to survive) that they serve and whose support they need.  WTF is wrong with the Sheriff up there?
1330274022823784449 2020-11-22 06:16:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @perfectsliders Presuming there is history in 100 years.

I would recommend that they turn and make a deal, give up the truth, before the Hammer falls.  To the little guys and gals, do it because they will throw you under the bus without a thought.
1330271892520001536 2020-11-22 06:08:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @M2Madness @bigbirdx2 @LLinWood Wait a mo!  @LLinWood seems to have a deep knowledge of what is going on and has gone on with Dominion.  Didn't the super self righteous talking bobble-head on @FoxNews, @TuckerCarlson, say the attorneys in the Trump team have no knowledge of what Sidney Powell has come up with?
1330270654566952962 2020-11-22 06:03:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @scotinstowe @CorporalBen @DaleCha57372116 @TuckerCarlson I guess he made a choice between seven figures or more and his country and people who were loyal to him.  Considering, @FoxNews may be the right place for @TuckerCarlson.
1330270215389802501 2020-11-22 06:01:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Official_TACtv @UkraineBlues I don't know.  Biden was useless and criminal.  It may be a toss up.

Will he cite unnamed WH sources &amp; Trump attorneys that say that they never saw any proof of cheating in GA?  Apparently, Sekulow will not show Tucker his law suit for approval.  @FoxNews
1330266495352442883 2020-11-22 05:47:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DonaldJTrumpJr She probably got a raise.
1330266374745231366 2020-11-22 05:46:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tuesdayskirt Indeed, if the fate of the country is at stake and we are at risk of being taken over by Soros/China/Deep State players the @FBI needs to be kept as far away as possible.  Our futures depend on that.

1330264075763331075 2020-11-22 05:37:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RebelACole @BillFOXLA @FOXLA I remember in 2018 all of the R seats (especially in CA) that were won and then suddenly when truck loads of ballots magically appeared when to the Ds.  Dominion must have had a field day in 2018.
1330263608043970566 2020-11-22 05:35:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BillFOXLA @FOXLA See that's what happens when the Democrat Election Fraud cartel is understaffed and has to go after the President because he won by a lot more than anyone expected.

1330244723756453893 2020-11-22 04:20:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MAJMO50 @debaroo54 The police undermine their authority and acceptance in their communities when they enforce unconstitutional / unlawful edicts of tin pot dictators to the detriment of the community.  We have seen what good cops can do when they refuse to stand behind bad politicians.

1330243065848750082 2020-11-22 04:13:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 So Nevada counted about 78,000 more votes than were cast?  Wow, that Dominion software and Election Workers are better than I thought.
1330211679414738945 2020-11-22 02:09:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> ...that such may or may not exist.  This is crap pretend journalism at a level that even @CNN rarely sinks to.  It is a direct attack on the Trump effort to defend America against massive Democrat Election Fraud by casting doubt by innuendo using mystery sources.  Disgusting.
1330211678382862344 2020-11-22 02:09:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> ...these mystery people with unnamed &amp; unnumbered people in Trumps legal team without a description of their position.  He stated (did they tell him?) that these cyphers of humanity did not see evidence, documents, software, or testimony.  The implication in all this being...
1330211677321752582 2020-11-22 02:09:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> ...any evidence that computer fraud happened.    So his first diatribe part is that unnamed &amp; unnumbered people who are in the WH in undefined positions, and who would believe anything that supports Trump told him that they did not see any evidence.   He then went on to link....
1330211676306673664 2020-11-22 02:09:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> ...What people, who?  How many?  He said that they would believe any explanation.  The implication there is that these mythical WH people would buy anything that supports their beliefs whether or not it was true.  He said that these "make believe?" unnamed people have not seen...
1330211674972954630 2020-11-22 02:09:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TuckerCarlson  @FoxNews   This is the worst type of misinformation, propaganda, and lies by implication that you will see in a long time.  It is disgusting.   https://t.co/F4wKzZ6AxF  In true @CNN fashion, Carlson said he heard from "People" in the WH.  By his own standard, ....

To the police.  When you enforce unconstitutional laws to the detriment of the community, you are destroying acceptance of your authority.

1330167278185439234 2020-11-21 23:12:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @America1stMom @Wil_Johnson1 So the White rulers of MI are cheating a black man out of the office to which he was elected &amp; inserting an old white guy in the name of racial justice.  Very Democrat.  If I was James, I would be looking at a number of different law suits.  One being Democrat systemic racisim.

1330165017694642177 2020-11-21 23:03:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kentpg According to him, so is killing babies.  Did he win the Governorship or were the votes counted by Dominion?
1330164659039723523 2020-11-21 23:02:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jsolomonReports @willbarrett_1 Then why did he certify the election results.  Something is rotten in the state of Georgia.
1330164230218244098 2020-11-21 23:00:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @simongerman600 PS - I do not consider a five year degree in some crapola like community service or gender studies an indication of education.  Rather it is an indicator of indoctrination and ignorance.  Kids graduating from HS in the Democrat stronghold of LA are challenged to read comic books.
1330163610874761219 2020-11-21 22:58:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @simongerman600 Is that per the Dominion count?

The massive Democrat Election Fraud in this, just one area is obvious  Hopefully for you, your contract locked in your 7 or 8 figure compensation, because you are toast.
1330143361374806021 2020-11-21 21:37:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LibertyBell1000 True?  If so, we now have a Bankrupt Spanish company counting American votes in Germany.  MSM - "Nothing to see here, move along".
1330142441224155136 2020-11-21 21:34:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @newtgingrich May be very important when massive Democrat Election Fraud is looked at in MN.

1330141812309299204 2020-11-21 21:31:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @wmmII88 How ironic for the Democrats that a black man may be a key part of the group that saves America from their Criminal take over that would destroy the country.
1330141066843082754 2020-11-21 21:28:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Tarawa @Atlantiso1 Yes, that is the one.
1330140922177335300 2020-11-21 21:28:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Atlantiso1 @PaulStout10 PS - And that does not even start to touch on the Soros, "I will destroy America", China, Venezuela, Clinton, Democrat Elite, RINO, CIA, Deep State, etc. connections.  This election was so corrupted by the Democrats that it will become legend.
1330140260702052353 2020-11-21 21:25:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Atlantiso1 @PaulStout10 The people who counted our votes in GERMANY &amp; had its servers seized my mysterious "military" forces, closed their offices, did not show for a hearing, lawyered up with Clinton Attorneys, and are now on the lam.  MSM, "Nothing to see here, move along".  Democrat Election Fraud.
1330122208551776260 2020-11-21 20:13:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Usatorz1 @ilovetrump93 No, the @FBI would just bury the proof of the coup to take over the country.  The investigation should be done by reliable people.
1330121413244674049 2020-11-21 20:10:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dhiggins63 If the Democrats get away with the massive Election Fraud and take over the country, those same morons, many of whom voted Democrat, will be standing in line to get at the garbage dumpster for food.

1329940512686542849 2020-11-21 08:11:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EliLake You know that the people who counted the votes in Germany have had their server seized, closed down their offices, hired Clinton's legal hit men, and is on the lam?  Does that matter?
1329930485124894721 2020-11-21 07:31:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 Good for him.  Let us see if the Democrats cheated a qualified black candidate out of his seat.    Democrat Election Fraud knows no racial barriers.

1329926767025430529 2020-11-21 07:17:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> THE COMPANY WHO COUNTED OUR VOTES IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY HAS HAD ITS SERVERS SEIZED, CLOSED ITS OFFICES, AND GONE INTO HIDING.  Apparently the Democrat Party of massive Election Fraud &amp; MSM wants us Americans to accept the results that this, now missing, company provided.
1329923721440550913 2020-11-21 07:04:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @iheartmindy @NVSOS @PatriotPartyNV @BattlebornPats @JDRucker @AZPatriotParty @RealMattCouch @DonaldJTrumpJr @johncardillo Well, Dominion is on the run now.  If they don't make it out of the country and are nabbed, maybe they can be asked why a "neutral" vote counter contributed to a political PAC.

1329921936252563456 2020-11-21 06:57:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 @BreitbartNews Has Dominion closed down their offices there too?
1329920930403950592 2020-11-21 06:53:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealOmarNavarro @JWSNMNJ So we are to accept the election results based on the German vote count made by a company whose specialty is election fraud and is now on the lam.   What think you @TuckerCarlson ?
1329920256991653888 2020-11-21 06:51:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @Herbert_L_Reed Hey, I hear that they are shredding votes now.  Doesn't that beat all?
1329919420454473728 2020-11-21 06:47:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HillaryClinton Hey congratulations.  I hear that Dominion who counted our votes in Germany is on the lam, but hired your law firm.  Good going.  PS - Any idea where the servers with all of the election information on it is?
1329918668533157889 2020-11-21 06:44:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @robreiner The election is still in question.  I understand that the people who counted our votes, Dominion, have lawyered up with Clinton attorneys, closed their offices, and are on the lam.  Maybe when they are caught we can find out who won.  Massive Democrat Election Fraud won't cut it.
1329917378491105282 2020-11-21 06:39:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @johnerican @rentonMagaUK Hahahaha  The people who counted the votes in our election are on the lam.  Hahahaha

1329916671482503168 2020-11-21 06:36:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @may_talcott Hey @TuckerCarlson  @FoxNews  Dominion has lawyered up (with Clinton attorneys), closed offices in Canada &amp; the US &amp; in PA, and gone into hiding.  Their servers were taken in Germany where they did the count.  Still think that America should accept the results provided by them?
1329915679542181888 2020-11-21 06:33:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @IvankaTrump @ginaraquelrocks Wow, that's going to put a crimp in the Democrat base.  Looks like Dominion will have to retune their algorithms.

1329911465831088129 2020-11-21 06:16:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @danielchaitin7 @dcexaminer The Dominion people have disputed Powell's assertions but apparently have closed their offices and disappeard and may be on the run, but that dispute is good enough for @Twitter
1329909826839662592 2020-11-21 06:09:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LLinWood WTF  That will play big in the law suit.  Wonder what the Supreme Court thinks of shredding ballots?
1329907549420744706 2020-11-21 06:00:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @johnerican @rentonMagaUK True?  So the vote counters got out of town quick?

1329906837991243776 2020-11-21 05:57:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NewportLost I do.  I block every advertiser on @twitter that I can.

1329904776012709889 2020-11-21 05:49:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MAiJiNTHEARTIST @GeorgePapa19 The vote tabulation and history for the entire country is on those servers.  Without them no one can claim victory.  If bad guys military, then who ordered it and under what authority?   If good guys, Trump has a record of everything that happened on Election day and after.
1329853663100039168 2020-11-21 02:26:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @intheMatrixxx Hope the guy is well lawyered up.  He may need it.

You ask them about the servers in Germany being seized?  You ask them what you paid American Officials (money or other) to buy &amp; install the machines?  Etc.
1329843440616497153 2020-11-21 01:45:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Jennyjen010 @reubing 1/2  Hey, @tuckercarlson of the now mostly defunct @foxnews.  Why don't  You invite the Dominion people on your show and do your number on them?  You ask them why they backed out of the hearing?  You ask them about company ownership?  You ask them about vote flipping?  ....

But I must ask, would we have been any better off if Romney was elected?  The thing that gets me is that Romney and Ryan have joined up with the exact people that royally screwed them

1329819915675582468 2020-11-21 00:12:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MajorPatriot @DigitalSunl Who brought Dominion into PA? Who authorized the payments? Who was responsible for certifying the machines and the software?  Taking a look at the people who are identified by the answers to those questions will tell a lot.
1329819017343684608 2020-11-21 00:08:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bitsy423 @BarbaraRedgate @TuckerCarlson @SidneyPowell1 We can respectfully disagree  There have been to many occasions where lying evil has been given the benefit of the doubt by good people  A talking head does not get to summon the President's legal team, demand to see their evidence, and then take it upon himself to pass judgement
1329818248557129729 2020-11-21 00:05:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @APFactCheck You want the simple truth.  Trump won by a huge amount.  That is clear proof that the AP, MSM, Deep State, Democrat lies &amp; propaganda have failed and few believe what you say.  So lie away as much as you want, all you do is push more people away and make the truth more evident.
1329817310887030784 2020-11-21 00:02:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @APFactCheck Proof of massive Democrat Election fraud is all around us &amp; &amp; being documented through many avenues  AP lies  I watched the news conference and not once did anyone blame Chavez.  AP lies  Mountains of proof (including Dominions manuals) that show ability to flip votes.  AP lies

I may be incorrect in that &amp; Tucker may demand proof from Giuliani of his assertions.
1329814293483700226 2020-11-20 23:50:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MAGADebRN1 I did not see your tweet, but have no doubt that @TuckerCarlson sold out and cashed in big for it.  If anyone disagrees, I can give a sh!t.  Tired of snivelers.  We have had four years of that.  If anyone agrees, they can do the indicated thing, turn off Carlson for good.

1329811351519301641 2020-11-20 23:38:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @thebradfordfile @RepStevenSmith @FoxNews will spend the next five years trying to top Yogi Bear reruns in ratings and it will never happen.
1329811043938275328 2020-11-20 23:37:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joshdcaplan @JajsaArthur Run Dominion Run.  Hide behind corrupt Democrat Fraudsters. Hide behind corrupt Deep Staters. Hide behind the corrupt MSM. Hide behind the corrupt Romney type RINOs.  Run Dominion Run.  Save yourself.
1329782865928720385 2020-11-20 21:45:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WayneDupreeShow If a @FoxNews talking head broadcasts in the woods, Would anyone hear the lies?
1329782418304233473 2020-11-20 21:43:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EdMarkey How about lowering my taxes. How about protecting the country from Antifa and BLM thugs. How about protecting the country from predatory foreign nations (China?) who will take our jobs. How about stopping massive Democrat Election Fraud.  Bet the above is not on your list.
1329781823384088576 2020-11-20 21:41:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @roxyloveslucy @TuckerCarlson Apparently @TuckerCarlson believes that if he commands the appearance of the presidents attorney, they must appear and provide all of their confidential materials being used to prepare their Supreme Court action.  He then will decide on the outcome of the election.
1329773807364542465 2020-11-20 21:09:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @STOPdaSteal @Ajax2847 Really simple, @FoxNews and the rest of MSM have forgotten that if we do not click the on button they do not exist.  I have not tuned into @FoxNews since election night, @OANN and @newsmax instead and when this Democrat Election Fraud is resolved @twitter is gone as well.
1329771860163084289 2020-11-20 21:01:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kimKBaltimore @BlissTabitha If the assertion that Trump won in a landslide is true, the answer is no.  They are victims of massive Democrat Election Fraud and any number of crimes to facilitate the steal.  At this point no one can be sure who won any election because of Democrat criminality.
1329764423150432259 2020-11-20 20:31:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Chris77744410 @vicksiern How much did @FoxNews offer @TuckerCarlson ?
1329764035508662272 2020-11-20 20:30:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JDRucker @FoxNews Actually it was a 3.5 minute declaration of his wonderfulness with something about flying saucers and 1 minute implying Powell is lying because she told him to fuck off.  @FoxNews does not dictate terms to Powell
1329761986012332034 2020-11-20 20:22:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TimRunsHisMouth Correction - The one time highest ranked cable show.
1329761209508188162 2020-11-20 20:19:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BreitbartNews Wow another fake poll.  The lies never stop.
1329604494447951872 2020-11-20 09:56:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec 2/2  Two observations.  1. Carlson implied through his presentation that Powell was lying.  That is beyond defensible, and  2. Powell is building a case for presentation ultimately to the Supreme Court in an environment where witnesses have been threatened. by Democrat thugs.
1329603537748168704 2020-11-20 09:52:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec 1/2  Wow, what a raft.  Carlson spent 4+ minutes telling us how honest he is and at the end when he asked Powell to submit her proof for his judgement, she told him to phuck off.  He did it in the way that was pure innuendo that she had no proof.
1329601744926511104 2020-11-20 09:45:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealSaavedra @bitsy423 No, if he has something to say, let him post it on @twitter.  I am done with anything @FoxNews related.  I don't trust any of them.
1329543400312356864 2020-11-20 05:53:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @texaskat2003 @KelemenCari The Democrats have never been concerned about legal.  It is what they can get away with for them.
1329543107331858437 2020-11-20 05:52:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LorettaKyle6 @ZZZJazzy @CiceroConsulta1 If I was Dominion &amp; the massive Election Fraud Democrats, Rudy's reaction would freeze me to the core.  I get the feeling that there is a second, very real, game being played under the surface.  No way Trump could have seen this coming for years &amp; not prepared completely for it.
1329541125233729537 2020-11-20 05:44:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ZZZJazzy @dkrwilliams Wow.  So the servers that did our election count are gone?  WTF, there is no way to verify the total count or certify the election if the servers are missing.  This is strange and out of a cheap novel.  It is like the election never happened, but Biden is claiming the win.
1329539659370696704 2020-11-20 05:38:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @miles_commodore Not that I would have turned to them anyway, but all @CNN and @MSNBC did was insure I watched on another source.  I did love the part where the reporter identified herself as being from @CNN and everyone broke out into laughter.
1329539144435986432 2020-11-20 05:36:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KelemenCari Leave it to Democrats and RINOs to bring in Venezuelan voting machines and software.  Leave it to Soros to be all over this.
1329538515131015168 2020-11-20 05:34:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @newsmax @realDonaldTrump @newsmax and @oann.  The rest is lying trash.
1329538147235971072 2020-11-20 05:32:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JZmirak @_BetsyRoss Intelligence, honor, integrity, and conviction.  Sidney Powell.
1329537710726414337 2020-11-20 05:31:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto @nycookie15 What is the DOJ?  I heard about it, but it hasn't done anything after the aborted coup so it is getting dim in the minds of Americans.  Wasn't it supposed to protect America against criminals &amp; things like massive Democrat Election Fraud?  I think that is what its supposed to do.
1329536838348881920 2020-11-20 05:27:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealMattCouch @EricMMatheny Isn't she on the network that is coming in under Yogi Bear in ratings?  In any case, the discovery part of the law suit would be tasty to say the least.  No, Dominion is going to fight this like Democrats always do, paying off people, lying, having the MSM spew false info, etc.
1329529861556248576 2020-11-20 04:59:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @maggieNYT A scene repeated many times a few weeks back.
1329529642282143744 2020-11-20 04:59:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JohnJHarwood I really liked it when your correspondent identified herself as being with @CNN and everyone laughed.  You are lucky for @FoxNews or you would truly be the worst.  Now it is a contest.  PS - Think that you are going to be sold to China?
1329529206577848320 2020-11-20 04:57:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Hoya97 Biden, concede and get out of the country fast and I will consider the journey to healing begun.
1329528930525581312 2020-11-20 04:56:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @twin0830us @BarnettforAZ @SidneyPowell1 And Arizona perhaps.  At this point one cannot trust or have faith in any Democrat or RINO elected official.
1329525334832672768 2020-11-20 04:41:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @USMCMIL03 To late, you just upped the count.
1329525132650418178 2020-11-20 04:41:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NewsPolitics @FoxNews @RudyGiuliani I watched the news conference and you are full of sh!t.  Anyone having any doubts that @FoxNews is lying to them need only pull up the conference and watch themselves.  When Fox went over to the evil dark side, it held nothing back.  @newsmax and @OANN will have honest reporting.
1329524508689010691 2020-11-20 04:38:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @railboy63 @FoxNews I watched the conference &amp; that is an out &amp; out pure complete &amp; total lie by @FoxNews.  WTF, what a garbage heap.  What was not true?  That he had affidavits of massive Democrat Election Fraud?  That the counting company is a Venezuelan enterprise with counting done out of US?
1329523416550969345 2020-11-20 04:34:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AOC Well geeze, someone has to go out to print the money.  Didn't you take Economics in College?
1329514768235778048 2020-11-20 03:59:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealBrysonGray @Patrici15767099 There is nothing more attractive than intelligence, courage, and faith in one human being.
1329513625480957953 2020-11-20 03:55:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @thebradfordfile @TheRISEofROD I did see it and agree 100%
1329513496736792576 2020-11-20 03:54:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MAGADebRN1 And yet, @FoxNews is falling behind them.
1329513175792775169 2020-11-20 03:53:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 @joepalojoe Glad someone is still watching @FoxNews to keep the rest of us up on what they are spewing.
1329512401021018112 2020-11-20 03:50:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @carrieksada @jat1020 @realDonaldTrump I watched the one today.  It was incredible. It laid out the beginnings and a good part of the direction of the legal effort that will be launched.  Every American should be aware of what is going on.  The MSM is purposely suppressing the news and lying to America.
1329493487813763072 2020-11-20 02:35:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TeamTrump @noelphx It was great.  Watched the entire thing.
1329490040188063744 2020-11-20 02:21:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KamVTV @Believe_N_USA Wonderful, go get them.
1329450506637500418 2020-11-19 23:44:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Thomas1774Paine I think that we will have to see local communities declare independence of their states.
1329448800994390022 2020-11-19 23:37:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto The Democrats are thugs.  If it does come down to it, show no mercy.
1329437823376744457 2020-11-19 22:54:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @correctthemedia Something that the MSM will never report.  Democrat operatives (= thugs) threaten Republican Officials and their Children to force them to certify massive Democrat Election Fraud.
1329398975712038912 2020-11-19 20:19:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TheRightMelissa @lightning989 Is @twitter going to dispute this?
1329398751954276356 2020-11-19 20:18:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced @EricMMatheny Dear @twitter   Is the fact that the officials were threatened and intially changed their vote under attack by Democrat operatives and then changed their vote back to the original being disputed?
1329398283517583360 2020-11-19 20:17:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced @EricMMatheny There needs to be a federal in depth investigation and charges brought, stat.
1329397859712593920 2020-11-19 20:15:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump I clicked on the "disputed" thingy and ended up seeing a whole raft of one sided Bull Shit that was mainly lies.  Interestingly enough, the lie dispute statements are presented as fact with no counter discussion or refutation of them.  The disputes are not disputed.  @Twitter
1329175651270553600 2020-11-19 05:32:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @OlderWiseOne So whats the penalty?
1329175476586180609 2020-11-19 05:31:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @plantlady293 @wvufanagent99 Won't make any difference, Harvard will just get it's major donor China to pick up the slack.
1329175187011485697 2020-11-19 05:30:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @impulsivewoman Well, that's 7,000 Democrat votes that will be missed next election.
1329175032342355968 2020-11-19 05:29:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jimbo_always @diamactive2001 I guess that NYS can always borrow the money from Texas to pay him.
1329174515805405185 2020-11-19 05:27:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @OlderWiseOne When Zuckerberg say a democratic process is he referring to fraud and cheating?
1329174118827130880 2020-11-19 05:26:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @davereaboi @LyndaG1963 Hahahahaha  Dumb phucks.  Remember when @FoxNews had it all?  That was two weeks ago. 🤣  So has the public relations firm Fox hired convinced anyone that Fox is not a scummy as it is?
1329173561638993920 2020-11-19 05:24:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @miles_commodore Good question.  As far a Northam, that is the easy one.  Democrat Election Fraud.  How many children have died because of the Democrat evil cheat?  As far as the others, a complete mystery.
1329173183082098690 2020-11-19 05:22:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CorporalBen @SpeakerPelosi Were the votes counted on Dominion machines?  Just asking.
1329158641937616898 2020-11-19 04:24:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @miles_commodore Will Americans sit still while an illegal Marxist government locks them in their houses, taxes them silly, and dictates every aspect of their lives?  Taxation without representation began our country.
1329154483822026753 2020-11-19 04:08:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kylie_oneil75 Send in the marshals and make some arrests.  Not in this country!
1329152241261899776 2020-11-19 03:59:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @may_talcott That is purely racist.
1329142019092975616 2020-11-19 03:18:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @charliekirk11 @willbarrett_1 That probably ended up, when processed through the Dominion System, as 27,500 Democrat Votes.  Who is the real governor of CA?
1329141048388452352 2020-11-19 03:14:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @roxyloveslucy @gatewaypundit :-)  Male, 6'4 3/4"", 230 lbs.
1329116223175495680 2020-11-19 01:36:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @roxyloveslucy @gatewaypundit Were the votes counted by Dominion?  Asking for a friend.
1329099589157208065 2020-11-19 00:30:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Purrfections5 Does not matter.  Odds are that BLM and Antifa will burn it down long before Christmas.
1329099369400786944 2020-11-19 00:29:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sayitnspinit @realDonaldTrump Exposed the vast amount of corruption and criminality in out government and elites.  He also greatly helped the American people at cost to multinational corporations and other entities that have been ripping them off for ages.
1329098891178885121 2020-11-19 00:27:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Reuters Massive Democrat Election Fraud.  Democrats threatening children of election officials.  MSM lies  Social Media manipulation and censorship.  That is what is affecting the public's confidence in what has be come the big lie; American Democracy.
1329098330836668416 2020-11-19 00:25:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ewarren So who is going to pay for the anchor?  Are people that did not take out loans, people who paid of their loans, &amp; people who served in the military &amp; worked their way through college going to be held back from buying homes, etc. to pay for those who took the loans they can't pay?
1329097544844996608 2020-11-19 00:22:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @p3driver @cocoaudie It may be time to send in the Marshalls and take control of the criminal enterprise.  No society can tolerate threatening children to gain political advantage and survive.
1329097137225834497 2020-11-19 00:20:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Toneman807 @tazmac55 It may come to this:  "...whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it..."  I hope not, but will the American people be denied their birth right to a representative gov't and allow a Marxist takeover?
1329096497787326464 2020-11-19 00:17:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump I am so phucking tired of the @twitter disputed BS messages that I can scream.  It wil be good to drop the platform when all this is over.  How about:  The people involved in the massive Democrat Election Fraud  disputes that there was massive Democrat Election Fraud.
1329096070631092224 2020-11-19 00:16:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 @GovInslee Was Inslee legally elected or his his seat based on the massive Democrat Election Fraud that we have become so aware of?
1329081556686684168 2020-11-18 23:18:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit @KristinnFR That guy needs to be in jail, stat.  Will we live in a country where our lives are dictated by Democrat thugs?  We now have massive Democrat Election Fraud coupled with Democrat thug threats made against children.  Unacceptable.
1329036563095769088 2020-11-18 20:19:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @XArmandKleinX Death Threats &gt; Courage some times.  This is what we are fighting against.
1329035933639819264 2020-11-18 20:17:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RamblingMother More likely the death threats aimed at children.
1329034158648135680 2020-11-18 20:10:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @nedryun Looking at all of the Democrat Election Fraud going on, one wonders how many pro-lifers actually voted for Biden.
1329032395538931712 2020-11-18 20:03:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 @bluridg4 Because he will bring down the force of the CA on them.  It is what tyrants and dictators do.
1329031738060800000 2020-11-18 20:00:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @anna12061 @gatewaypundit Leeches live well off of the hosts body.
1329031478450089985 2020-11-18 19:59:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec @Fan4Cal To #2A or slavery.  Country's choice.
1328859640373776384 2020-11-18 08:36:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Twitter Test #1: ‘Absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud.’
1328859529442779138 2020-11-18 08:36:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tedcruz @marycjoyce2 LOL, they probably had to pay 27 programmers to write the code to remove the warning from your tweet.  Now have someone else tweet it and see what happens.
1328858935038656512 2020-11-18 08:33:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LeeCapobianco1 I watched part as well.
1328858725331865600 2020-11-18 08:33:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WVVETDAN @RPCovit There are three possibilities.  1. This is resolved in a way acceptable to the American people and we go to an honest transparent election system. 2. The people accept being slaves in their own country. 3. #2A   I am praying for 1. and fear 3.  I don't think 2. will happen.
1328858024430116865 2020-11-18 08:30:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JuliansRum @toby_dorena The Democrats will be more than happy with a Marxist dictatorship with their edicts enforced by the gun.  A lot like the Venezuelan model they all admire.  At this point, one wonders if we have had a republic for a while with the massive Democrat Election Fraud going on.
1328856584600973314 2020-11-18 08:24:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bubblebathgirl At this point, I wonder how many Democrats were elected by mistake rather then massive Democrat Election Fraud.  Will the police enforce this?
1328855909481660418 2020-11-18 08:21:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @perfectsliders You left out Democrats.
1328840749220171776 2020-11-18 07:21:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bindyb123 @newsmax @FoxNews Me too.
1328840179767939072 2020-11-18 07:19:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JonathanTurley @ocmtber @FoxNews PS - By your outstanding legal analysis, blind observers would be acceptable.  There is nothing in the law that says the observers have to be alive.  Any opinion on that?  Maybe the Democrats should wheel in some of the departed, their base.  What a tool.
1328839515696349184 2020-11-18 07:16:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lampwright4 It is so sad.  How much better would our lives be without an illegitimate government.  Our elites and leaders are like tics attached to the body of the people.
1328838310123372544 2020-11-18 07:11:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JonathanTurley @ocmtber C'mon you legal turnip.  You are saying that legally mandated observers are not required to actually be allowed to observe.  WTF?  You need apply for a gig with the "new" @FoxNews.
1328837191171067904 2020-11-18 07:07:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bud_Doggin @nususan1 Hold on Joe, if you can become President of our beloved country, you may beat the charges and not have to go to prison with your entire criminal family for the large number of crimes you committed.
1328836868620709889 2020-11-18 07:06:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ajc @Proud2bAmerikn Arizona is under 11,000 too.  Massive Democrat Election Fraud may have missed the mark a bit.
1328836554471575553 2020-11-18 07:04:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HawleyMO @Dwarvish123 @Facebook LOL, I don't have a @Facebook account (don't miss them) and I wonder if they still track me.
1328834633056743424 2020-11-18 06:57:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bubblebathgirl @tullyframe When this is over, if all conservatives shunned @twitter, @facebook, and Google, they would quickly come to their knees and likely have their ability to continue in question.  They can only phuck us if we let them.
1328831929181818883 2020-11-18 06:46:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KeishaJake @Cuds_1246 Yeah the action was wrong, blah, blah, blah.  But the harm was done, wasn't it?  So what will be the cost to @twitter for it's wrong action?  Nothing, I'll bet.  Same old sh!t.
1328830289255170048 2020-11-18 06:40:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NahBabyNah It is starting to appear that we have not had honest elections in many years.  The people of the United States have become vassals / slaves to an elite ruling class that have maintained control through massive Election Fraud.  We have no representation or skin in our own country.

1328730285601550338 2020-11-18 00:02:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Anyone else getting the feeling that our government (mostly Democrats &amp; some RINOs) is so dirty that it is beyond comprehension?  Throw in the MSM.  We have all (all colors and religions and viewpoints) have been living as vassals / slaves of an elite who rule by fraud and lies.
1328722166175592453 2020-11-17 23:30:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 @gatewaypundit Wisconsin wants Trump to pay $ 7.9 Million so it can fake a recount and say that it did not commit the massive DEMOCRAT ELECTION FRAUD that it committed.  If each state did this, it would cost the campaign $400,000,000 to see the degree of DEMOCRAT ELECTION fraud that occurred.
1328713857330659334 2020-11-17 22:57:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ProudOhioNative PS - Just came across this: (read down the whole chain).   https://t.co/IcwLuuy0u2  What'ca think, no fraud here.  I, like most, am tired of the lying BS.
1328712623085424641 2020-11-17 22:52:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AmericaJapan01 The spirit of the Democrat elites lives strong in the BLM / Antifa thugs.

1328711954328813569 2020-11-17 22:49:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ProudOhioNative 2/2  Til then, there is the mathematical analysis of the counts which show impossible trends &amp; count spikes, lockout of GOP observers, stop of the count, ballots appearing at 4:00AM after the stop, voting dead, ballots not being counted, and on and on.  Not enough at this point?
1328711083725492227 2020-11-17 22:46:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ProudOhioNative 1/2  So you want instant disclosure of evidence.  Just open the package, place contents in a bowl, and the add hot water and you have all the evidence you need.  Stop the BS.  The election was two weeks ago.  Evidence is coming in faster than can be processed.
1328699897613152256 2020-11-17 22:01:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @iamjumpingin @lightning989 It is not a question of how stupid.  Biden is in the position he is because of massive DEMOCRAT ELECTION FRAUD.  The plan is to cram it up your a$$ and there is nothing that you can do about it.  So you are not dumb, just defrauded through the system to be enforced by armed force
1328698817311510528 2020-11-17 21:57:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lavist1 Haley, my girl, died in my arms two years ago.  She was a rescue so I no idea how old she was.  She was my girl for 15 years.  It hurts.  But I know some day we will be together again.  Sorry for your loss.  https://t.co/arjysaHpYH

1328467392284958720 2020-11-17 06:38:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit Was he legally elected or is he the result of Democrat Election Fraud.  One is starting to wonder.
1328467013564469248 2020-11-17 06:36:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealEricCarmen When you take illegal control of a country it makes sense to try to lock down the people so they can't take action.  Won't work, but what the hey.

1328466421865615361 2020-11-17 06:34:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 @gatewaypundit Interesting if true.

1328442824262443008 2020-11-17 05:00:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KristinBTate @Jomalley61 Sort of like the Obamacare penalty.
1328440418304856064 2020-11-17 04:50:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Donadeedooda So after paying their loans off they get to pay off the loans of others.  What a huge rip off.

1328131803467530240 2020-11-16 08:24:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @nolchickrobin Per the @twitter note, the people who rigged the election dispute that the election was rigged.  Thank you for that wonder message twitter  Keep up the good work.
1328091758756982784 2020-11-16 05:45:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jwhaifa Here is the problem with Bolton &amp; his ilk.  They know that the election was a exercise in massive Democrat Election Fraud.  They know much about how the American people had their right to representation stolen.  Yet they spew the shit as if the election was legit.  Disgusting.
1328053198242811904 2020-11-16 03:12:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NBCNewsPR @chucktodd @MeetThePress Phuck @chucktodd.  Play with your criminal Democrat friends.

I demand an honest recount and an audit of the votes.  I also demand an investigation to determine how many Republican ballot were destroyed.  This is criminal Democrat Election Fraud and it cannot stand in the United States.

1327782904357797888 2020-11-15 09:18:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump No, he should let the thugs burn DC to the ground.  It would fit the government.
1327782588224684033 2020-11-15 09:16:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec No problem, if Biden accomplishes the massive Democrat Election Fraud and steals the election, he can always run the government from his basement.  Does anyone really think any Democrat can be elected without widespread fraud?
1327781790996520961 2020-11-15 09:13:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marklevinshow They would but they are two busy committing election fraud to take the time.

You do not bring a nation together by attacking people relentlessly for four years and then taking control by massive Democrat Election Fraud.  How are you going to govern without at least 1/2 the country's consent?
1327752804983738369 2020-11-15 07:18:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @liquidlaugh Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it.  Will people give up freedom to Election Fraud?
1327729148148678656 2020-11-15 05:44:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MZHemingway @WingsofCrystal Will the Democrats turn the military and police on these people if they do not consent to be governed by a government put in place by Democrat Election Fraud?  Will the United States become a tin pot Marxist dictatorship run by a few elites?  This was not an honest election.

DEMOCRAT ELECTION FRAUD is not consent.

It has no authority.  This nation was founded on the bedrock principal that the government exists under the consent of the people!

1326916583080472576 2020-11-12 23:55:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dougducey   What are you doing to combat the Democrat Election Fraud in Arizona?  The fate of the country and of our state is hanging in the balance.  What are you doing.  Please let the people of Arizona know.  Pictured below is Arizona ballots.  https://t.co/zJzwzTRywW

1326911084171825152 2020-11-12 23:33:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jacksellers   I just tweeted you requesting a recount in Arizona.  I do have a question.  Does this make you as angry as me?  I would appreciate it if you would tell me and the other voters, Arizona Americans, in your district what you intend to do about this, in Arizona.  https://t.co/58z83Fpqxf

1326888718720929794 2020-11-12 22:04:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Please let us know your position on this and what you can do to provide a honest election result.  cc: @andybiggs4az

We demand a recount &amp; audit of the election vote in Maricopa County.  It is our belief that the election results are the result of significant fraud and want an honest count and recognition of votes.
1326884644789182464 2020-11-12 21:48:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump Sue, sue, sue, sue, and then sue again.  My state will not be stolen by Democrat Election Fraud.

Congressional &amp; local elections are very important as well as that for the top dog.  We all know that what the media says is mostly blatent lies and propaganda.
1326862287651549184 2020-11-12 20:19:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bubblebathgirl @DonnaNeedham10 No.  Next Question.  Democrat Election Fraud.

1326705379154128896 2020-11-12 09:56:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @7777MYNAME @TuckerCarlson I will catch the video.  @TuckerCarlson is on @FoxNews and I do not watch anyone on that network.
1326705096181215233 2020-11-12 09:55:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @American1299 Well she is clearly a part of the Democrat Election Fraud.  How did we end up with such skum in office?  A law suit will settle her hash and perhaps we (us the people of Arizona) should look to see if she is criminally implicated in our states Democrat steal.
1326685442893209601 2020-11-12 08:37:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @443777 @BreitbartNews Wow, Democrat Election Fraud has one of many faces in Arizona.  I am a citizen of this state and I voted and I demand an audit.  I have no tolerance for Democrat criminals using their office to Steal the Election.
1326684774497357825 2020-11-12 08:34:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @443777 @BreitbartNews Need a federal court order.
1326683990963621888 2020-11-12 08:31:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 This is different than the vote switching we have been hearing about.  It is multiple counts of the same ballots.
1326669468353785858 2020-11-12 07:33:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Has anyone checked the ballots in PA, MI, WI, and a few others for a small legend along the margin that says "Printed in China".  Just kidding, but I would check because the Democrats are that stupid.
1326668420079738880 2020-11-12 07:29:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FuctupMike PS - The election is well within the Democrat Election Fraud by cooking the computer counts.  Not to mention faked ballots, destruction of ballots, multiple voting, and every other Democrat dirty trick.  I think it is likely that James won.   White guy won big in black Detroit 🤣
1326667246446374913 2020-11-12 07:24:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FuctupMike Biden is corrupt beyond compare and he is a racist.  Go figure.    Sounds like desperation, play the race card.  Is she one of the Soros funded goons?  Now ask her about the Democrat Election Fraud that put white bread Gary Peters ahead of black (and well qualified) John James.
1326635480276893696 2020-11-12 05:18:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Thomas1774Paine What?

Everyone knows that Trump won in a landslide.  The question is, will the Democrats be able to Steal the Election and by doing so destroy our country.  Stay tuned.
1326626033181683713 2020-11-12 04:41:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LuckTooAsh @nolchickrobin @Former_Monkey @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Apparently they (DEMOCRAT ELECTION FRAUD PERPS) also gathered up ballots in nursing homes and care facilities and voted them.  Remember the @Project_Veritas videos of @IlhanMN flunky with a car full of ballots liberated from low income project people? Texas lady buying votes?
1326624566039310337 2020-11-12 04:35:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JohnBasham This is just the beginning point.  There is other possible computer malfeasance plus all of the other stuff pulled by DEMOCRAT ELECTION FRAUD.  Time for criminal Democrats to bolt from the country or turn states before it all comes down on them.
1326601039328337920 2020-11-12 03:01:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marklevinshow If I were the heads of states talking to Biden, I would hold off the pay for play money he is demanding until he is confirmed.

1326579250036568069 2020-11-12 01:35:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @atensnut @RosarioReynos10 He can't.  If he does, he may be looking at prison for his Burisma dealings and the myriad other crimes he committed.
1326567901013319680 2020-11-12 00:50:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @barmore27 @Tropic5A Hahahaha  Ryan worked his magic on @FoxNews and totally destroyed it.  I wonder where he will show up next or if he will hang on to the sinking ship and suck it as dry as he can.
1326566880807563266 2020-11-12 00:46:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LABeachGal1 It will be interesting to see if more seats flip red after there is a good look taken at the ballot counting machines.
1326566351171846144 2020-11-12 00:43:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @intalekshewal @realDonaldTrump @Emmita17E @Twitter @FoxNews @CNN I respectfully disagree.  For the first time, everyone is aware of the impact of social media and their actions.  Twitter, Google, Facebook, etc. have dropped all pretense and jumped the shark  After Trump is inaugurated for his second term (and he will be) there will be no mercy
1326565497417080833 2020-11-12 00:40:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CodeMonkeyZ 2/2  I think that the Democrat Election Fraud was a multifaceted attack with fake ballots, machine tampering, destruction of valid ballots, change of valid ballots, theft of votes from nursing homes, multiple votes, MSM propaganda blitz, and whatever else you can imagine.
1326564596761595906 2020-11-12 00:37:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CodeMonkeyZ 1/2  I think you are right on in your analysis, but did miss it here.  Fake ballots could well have been made in advance and just shipped in.  There are eye witness accounts of truckloads (van loads) arriving in the 4:00 AM  time frame to centers of states that had shut down.
1326563484407005185 2020-11-12 00:32:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @Emmita17E Hey @twitter, offical sources (@FoxNews and @CNN don't qualify) have not called the race for Biden.  Do you put warnings on his and his followers tweets?  Section 230 needs to go. :-).
1326562191386898432 2020-11-12 00:27:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec Wray must be fired, STAT.
1326561849475690496 2020-11-12 00:26:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @roxyloveslucy @BIZPACReview Good for them.  Americans must stand up against the evil left that would destroy our country through Democrat Election Fraud.  STOP THE STEAL.
1326561573133955072 2020-11-12 00:25:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GuyChicago5151 BOOM.  May I say it again, BOOM.  A full hand recount will bypass all Democrat Election Fraud in the counting phase with their preprogrammed "glitch" machines.  The state need to look at valid votes and not count the thoundsand (hundreds of thousands) fake votes Dems slipped in.
1326545165989801984 2020-11-11 23:19:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 Democrat Election Fraud or computer "glitch".  Ever get the feeling that the Democrat Party is a criminal organization that has been stealing the country blind for many years?
1326538918112632834 2020-11-11 22:54:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @perfectsliders I will be moving over to my account at Parler after this crap with the Democrat Election Fraud is sorted out.  My wife has started to spend time on hers.
1326538466490896386 2020-11-11 22:53:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @P8R1OT So the person (and those who aided him/her) who did the first dump of 130,000 fake Biden ballots in WI after the counting had stopped and in the wee hours of the morning is looking at 2,600,000 years.  I would recommend not to credit time off for good behavior.
1326536766866690050 2020-11-11 22:46:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal Our wonderful vets and their families have sacrificed so much for us and America and the Democrats are trying to cheat them out of their own country through massive Democrat Election Fraud.  Disgusting.
1326535809315430401 2020-11-11 22:42:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DrEtiquette Is this video legit?
1326521056006340608 2020-11-11 21:43:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Hopefully not, @newsmax is to good to sink to the @FoxNews level even before Fox declared itself as more corrupt and biased than @CNN.
1326520599078789120 2020-11-11 21:42:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 BIGLY STUFF.  Joe Biden has been declared "Almost" president elect by @FoxNews in light of this.  The Biden camp will sue the GSA to aid in the transition of the Fox designated Almost President Elect.  Also, Biden's lead shrinks in Arizona &amp; Democrat Election Fraud may not do it.
1326496214695645184 2020-11-11 20:05:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tgatorguy @50grey50 It just gets better and better.  Who are the agents, which agency, and who do they report to.  The overthrow of the American Government cannot stand.
1326495338299944960 2020-11-11 20:01:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tgatorguy @50grey50 Biden will never be president.  The Deep State may end up inserting him into that office and using force to keep him there and enforce his dictates, but he will be a tin pot dictator dancing to the orders of others and not the president.
1326491642551918592 2020-11-11 19:47:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ThePlqn @madepilita The point is simple.  Donald Trump won the presidency and Joe Biden is attempting to steal it through massive Democrat Election Fraud.  Everyone knows. There is no doubt.  The only difference between Americans and evil Democrats is that they approve of the massive fraud.
1326489775205875712 2020-11-11 19:39:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Now do Legal Votes.  Democrat Election Fraud is not a clear mandate for Marxist policies.

1326320074899156993 2020-11-11 08:25:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MsDayglo @DHochleutner There is some truth, there are a lot of rats to eat in NY &amp; LA.  Cockroaches by the billions for protean.   If you are comparing the people of NYC who need a therapy session when their latte is cold to the people resisting the boot of Hitler you need to see your therapist.
1326319143184859136 2020-11-11 08:21:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @nypost I thought judge Sullivan was busy.  He has no standing to take legal action since he is nothing but someone anointed by the MSM.
1326318804754812928 2020-11-11 08:20:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal Scummy Democrat Election Fraud.  No Democrat represents me or my country.  I will not accept evil.
1326290160279986176 2020-11-11 06:26:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AVindman PS - Do you smell it?  Do you feel what is coming?
1326290035633582080 2020-11-11 06:26:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AVindman Getting nervous?  Most military are not like you and value the oath to country made in the eyes of God.    Better get you butt to Ukraine while the getting is good.
1326289115273289729 2020-11-11 06:22:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @shangrimom @jimbrown1964 I am in Arizona and voted for Trump  There is now way Biden even came close to carrying Arizona.  Talk about Democrat Election Fraud.  We will see when the final vote is counted and then a recount and audit can begin.
1326275155220332545 2020-11-11 05:26:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChadPergram When you run out of fraud and your charge falls flat.
1326274444591992833 2020-11-11 05:24:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @reubing I agree in theory.  But there are two problems:  1 We don't know if they are really blue states.  Considering massive Democrat Election Fraud they may really be red.  2 If a true blue state burns itself to the ground, Democrats may move to red states and that would be a shame.
1326273319331487749 2020-11-11 05:19:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LeahR77 @CocoThePatriot What happened, did they lose a truck load of fake votes?
1326272101368565760 2020-11-11 05:14:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @greggutfeld So in the end you are a little weasel.  Sad.
1326271908002689025 2020-11-11 05:13:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MSNBC They also refuse to say that MSNBS is a legit news network.  Would you have them lie?

1326268376398716928 2020-11-11 04:59:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CNNPolitics Please cite the authority that Trump has lost.  You are getting into dangerous territory and abusing your broadcast license.  Inciting unrest and falsely claiming Biden is president is criminal and exposed you to civil liability
1326267825204330496 2020-11-11 04:57:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cabinetdoorgirl Time to call in the Feds.
1326266754209779712 2020-11-11 04:53:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @StmCh_ @carriedaway16 @realDonaldTrump What the phuck, so we are now running the country with leaders pimped by the MSM and who we dare not cross or they will turn loose the raging thugs.  PS - What Biden victory?
1326266360364589056 2020-11-11 04:51:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @truth_czar @MARILYN19556 How many are starting to wonder if any of the Democrat Election Fraud party victories currently and in the past are actually legit.  Imagine if all the harm Pelosi has done to the country was as the leader of a House majority illegally put into power and not really elected?
1326265688785182721 2020-11-11 04:49:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CNNPolitics It is my understanding that Pompeo does not report to @CNN nor recognize the #FakeNews network's authority to designate who is President.  @CNN refuses to acknowledge that Joe Biden is not the President Elect and will likely be running the shadow gov't with Barry in the future.
1326264417139486721 2020-11-11 04:44:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Acosta  https://t.co/pilKKKOSHs
1326262228824190976 2020-11-11 04:35:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 When Trump is reelected will @Foxnews still refer to Biden as the president elect?
1326261775424131073 2020-11-11 04:33:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kylie_oneil75 @gatewaypundit Imagine if there was not overt Democrat Election Fraud in CA.  People there must, on the most part, hate the lefty thugs and cheats.
1326261503540883457 2020-11-11 04:32:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal LOL
1326223013621104642 2020-11-11 01:59:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenSchumer Bull shit.  Besides, why did you have to pass an unconstitutional law in the middle of the night to serve your purpose whatever the fluck that is?  Your law taxed &amp; hurt millions who could not afford your garbage and forced people into very expensive inferior coverage.
1326207906002345985 2020-11-11 00:59:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JudgeJeanlne @FoxNews Not real.
1326197086136590336 2020-11-11 00:16:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BigFish3000 So the party of Democrat Election Fraud and BLM is trying to screw a black man and the people who voted for him out of a seat in the Senate.
1326189943404687362 2020-11-10 23:48:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JasonMillerinDC @LindaSuhler @politico True, just because they kill babies, support pedophilia, cover up massive crimes by their members, and are just plain evil does not mean that they are a Demonic Cult.  Satan's darlings have been falsely accused.
1326189412611313664 2020-11-10 23:46:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PrivilegedLydia @penkalski_amy They only just begun.
1326188482226610177 2020-11-10 23:42:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @frfrankpavone @Purrpatrol I have one way.  Throw out the fake votes, add back the Trump votes trashed, and do an honest count.  Simple.
1326187104204804096 2020-11-10 23:36:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Acosta Hahahahaha  What a moroon.  https://t.co/BvFXgRZoic
1326186125103300609 2020-11-10 23:33:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @nypost Carrying on the fine work of her husband.  PS - Tell her that Biden did not win and will not win.  https://t.co/69o49Ff1vB
1326185495550832640 2020-11-10 23:30:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Herbert_L_Reed @newsmax @RepAndyBiggsAZ @realDonaldTrump Biggs is my rep and it was my pleasure to vote for him.  There is now way that Trump did not win AZ hands down.  It would be something if with all of the Democrat Election Fraud, he still takes the state.    No look at McSally, she won too.
1326183818055741440 2020-11-10 23:23:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Jade_Lyn_B @kentpg @newsmax So where do you think Tucker is going to land after he and @FoxNews part ways?
1326183382611496960 2020-11-10 23:22:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BreitbartNews @NightWatchNorm Another fake poll.  The number has to be closer to 99%.
1326183016482263044 2020-11-10 23:20:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit Well I'll be.  Just when you think you have figured out the scores of different Democrat Election Fraud going on, another one surfaces.  LOL, ok old lady, fill out this vote for Biden or we are going to move Covid-19 people into your nursing home.  I can see it.
1326182343057395713 2020-11-10 23:18:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ronnieverruto @USMCMIL03 Done.
1326182190586056704 2020-11-10 23:17:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Scaramucci Democrat Election Fraud is why the MSM declared Biden the victor.  No one has won the election at this point.  The way things are going, we will be watching the inauguration of Trump on 01/20/21.
1326181717909020672 2020-11-10 23:15:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Honest and fair elections will end the Democrats because they can not win but few seats under that scenario.  On the side, Section 230 &amp; MSM election interference will also be addressed.
1326181717208563712 2020-11-10 23:15:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> The outcome of this will be the destruction of the Democrat Party.  I am not talking about the people that will end up being jailed for Democrat Election Fraud.  Rather about steps being taken like voter ID, guaranteed two party review of ballots, &amp; honest testable software.
1326179915171966976 2020-11-10 23:08:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Thomas1774Paine @NorthOfAtlanta1 I wonder if during Trump's second term @MittRomney will be investigated for his, his family's, and his friend's, crimes in the Ukraine.
1326179568374304769 2020-11-10 23:07:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @reg1776 @LJSpagnoli @BreitbartNews I guess they did not overturn the Democrat Election Fraud style elections there when they hae the chance.
1326179321518518272 2020-11-10 23:06:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @pnjaban @America1st_Kag Isn't he the guy that was fired (resigned) within the last 24 hours?
1326178885591994368 2020-11-10 23:04:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KMCRadio @NewportLost @POTUS And that is just the "glitches" identified and not the hundreds of thousands of fake, dead, non qualified votes.  Besides, who trusts that the new count.  Perhaps they diddled the software parameters to a 2% count flip rather than the 3% or 4% first reported to fake a fix.
1326177884801658881 2020-11-10 23:00:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealWayneRoot @SmallBiz4Trump Hey, try downloading @newsmax app.  I didn't need it since I have Cox Contour, but now have one click on my screen and thee it is.  No menus or screwing around.  Picture &amp; sound fidelity is great.
1326176060677877761 2020-11-10 22:53:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marildasantos3 @FoxNews I just downloaded the @newsmap app.  I did not need it since I can get the station through Cox Contour, but I love it.  It is very simple to use, one click instead of a menu to fight through.  I would recommend trying it.
1326174107654713344 2020-11-10 22:45:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @paul_furber @DisneyDope1962 If true it is not for me to say, but I would recommend that those "some bigger names" flip right now &amp; make a deal before it is to late.  You can be sure that the little fish are already singing (yes fish can sing).  How many years is it worth to protect Democrat Election Fraud?
1326161415770566656 2020-11-10 21:54:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jaketapper ls that a threat?  Would an employer hire a conservative with a love of country &amp; an ethical base or a loser with a useless neighborhood organizer degree from a college that did nothing but indoctrinate who has an attitude problem.  Besides, after a few years of Biden, what jobs?
1326158861334556672 2020-11-10 21:44:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @teamcombover16 Good question.  Now and in the past.  How much harm has been done to the country and its people by those put in place by Democrat Election Fraud?  The happenings now have shed a light on how phucked over the American people have been by the Democrats and Deep State.
1326158285553033217 2020-11-10 21:42:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Thomas1774Paine If you are in Utah, how ashamed of @MittRomney are you?  It is almost like Romney (family &amp; friends) were criminally involved in the Ukraine and he desperately wants Biden so that it can be covered up.
1326143896624115713 2020-11-10 20:45:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DonMcglashen Yeah, in all of the noise I forgot the blatantly fake @FoxNews polls.  Looks like Fox was in the bag for Biden all along.
1326143599436726276 2020-11-10 20:44:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SpinePainBegone @WashTimes And the head of the Election Fraud Division (a Deep State goon) resigns.  I am getting the feeling that the counter attack may have begun.  Ever wonder what Barr &amp; Trump were talking about on AF1 while traveling together to a rally?
1326142973491376129 2020-11-10 20:41:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @prairiegale @kidgolferman @VeBo1991 @FoxNews @PRyan @SpeakerRyan Although a old article, one has to conclude upon reading it that Ryan did something to destroy @FoxNews while aiming at Trump.  The greatest asset of @newsmax is Paul Ryan.
1326141674414776320 2020-11-10 20:36:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SebGorka @_Mama_Doc @realDonaldTrump Anyone who thinks his supporters are not with him all the way has no idea who we are.

It has lost its conservative audience by trashing, disrespecting, lying, and turning on them and surely will not pick up anyone from @CNN or @MSNBC.

The law does not give @FoxNews the authority to declare the winner.  Duh.  @CNN pulled its call in AZ with more to follow.  Duh.  Pick a country where you want to live, because Trump will end up winnig.  Duh.

1326134364925620225 2020-11-10 20:07:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ksorbs @MathPhysics3 It took a war to end the Nazis.  It took a war to make the United States a nation.  It took a war to free the slaves.  Perhaps it will take a war to end the Democrat / Marxist destruction of our country.  Perhaps it will take a war to free us in our own country.
1326133456284254208 2020-11-10 20:03:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EricTrump @joehos18 Or as the MSM would say, no indication of Democrat Election Fraud.
1326132960467152896 2020-11-10 20:01:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Will_holliday1 @MulliganTrails We will see.  That is what a honest election would have brough.  It is open to see if the Democrat Election Fraud results can trued back to the actual.
1326132103310766081 2020-11-10 19:58:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ItsJustJill @wvufanagent99 @IsraeliPM, what a grave disappointment your have become.  Everything you were, gone in an instant.  I am a great supporter of Israel, but can no longer support you.  Looks like you have joined the ranks of Nadler, Schumer, and Shiff all sell outs of the Jews.  So very sad.
1326130783770218498 2020-11-10 19:53:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @channelinggalt @OANN is great.  I subbed a while back soon after Ryan came on board of Fox.  It fast became clear what @FoxNews was becoming.  I still watched Fox to some degree.  After Tuesday, I tried @newsmax and it is top notch.  Now no Fox whatever, I am more than happy with my choices.
1325995998489927680 2020-11-10 10:57:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BobOxler111 Any chance that they can call over to @FoxNews and tell them?
1325979119394320385 2020-11-10 09:50:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump Yes.

1325966251961712640 2020-11-10 08:59:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LABeachGal1 In the MSM world of make believe and playing "act as if" Joe will always be president.

Haven't seen us kill a baby at birth. Haven't seen us make up enemy lists. Haven't seen us threaten riots if our candidate loses.  Little rosebud, war is not nice.  Grotesque, see Portland booking photos.

Between @OANN and @newsmax you have two wonderful styles with each bringing it all.  Leaving @FoxNews was seamless although there was a feeling of relief.
1325931681983856640 2020-11-10 06:42:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealMattCouch @Emmita17E Just switch to @Newsmax.  I am sure that they are covering the news.

He described it as the happiest days of his life.  How does it feel to be called an AntiSemite by Satan?
1325929390174162945 2020-11-10 06:32:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto @ConservVoice Hey Mitch.  Who knew that there was the heart of a tiger beating in that chest?  Well done.
1325929104604950528 2020-11-10 06:31:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @charliekirk11 Tell Karen that acting as if does not make it so.
1325928842142216193 2020-11-10 06:30:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChadPergram Under what authority?
1325928582787465217 2020-11-10 06:29:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MisterToxicMan Funny, it is only been a few days and it is like @Foxnews never existed.  I have @OANN and watch @newsmax.  Quality, not leftist bull shot.
1325927670954094593 2020-11-10 06:26:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CatsonQ @EvanAKilgore You mean the military whose anti Trump chief was just fired.  I think America is ready.
1325927242652737536 2020-11-10 06:24:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EvanAKilgore @LABeachGal1 OK.  I think most of America is ready.  I will not be governed under threat of turning loose the thugs.  I would remind the Communists that the penalties for treason are tough and will be enforced.
1325926562491891712 2020-11-10 06:21:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LABeachGal1 You are not my president and never will be.  The election is not over.  Phuck off back to your basement.
1325926120726749184 2020-11-10 06:19:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LABeachGal1 Dear @thehill   Biden is not President-elect.  You are lying to America!  Tell Biden that the election is not over.  The Democrat Election Fraud may be coming to an end but the determination of the winner is not even close.  Acting "as if" means 💩 in the real world.
1325920152479698944 2020-11-10 05:56:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Hey, guess what.  #FakeNews does not self complete any more.  Guess @twitter is censoring that.

Much of what is being done is illegal &amp; most is BS propaganda.  I hope the prosecutions are swift &amp; painful when Trump is reelected.  Tell @brhodes that neither @CNN or @FoxNews or any other #FakeNews network is empowered to name the president.
1325915815405785088 2020-11-10 05:38:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Feisty_FL It really sucks that we can't have an honest election and that a court of 9 people (including three leftists and a Bush turkey) get to decide our fate.  Whatever the outcome, this sucks and is not my idear of freedom or a government that represents me.
1325914928159485954 2020-11-10 05:35:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @rising_serpent @jeanetteburdick LOL, look at the field of talent in the Democrat (Election Fraud) Party.  When you cheat to win you do not need much talent or ability.  Anyway, it does not make any difference.  If Biden holds (God forbid) Soros will be president through Kamela.
1325914444510056448 2020-11-10 05:33:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WayneDupreeShow @CCM1956 Wow, I feel left out since he blocked me.  So I can't tell him what a jerk and loser he is and ask how it feels to suck on Ryan for the big bucks.  Oh well.
1325899381929697280 2020-11-10 04:33:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MarkDice @impulsivewoman @JoeBiden Hahahahaha  Nailed it.

1325898084061048832 2020-11-10 04:28:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump Do you think that when all of the Democrat Election Fraud is taken care of that you will top 320 Electoral Votes?
1325897318734856192 2020-11-10 04:25:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Acosta I guess he does not want that turnip in the way if he has to declare martial law.  Scared you 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.
1325896694018396162 2020-11-10 04:23:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RoseDC11 @robbipl @AdamLaxalt @realDonaldTrump Likely, maybe he thinks he is Sullivan.  That won't stand long and will only serve to invalidate the results in NV.
1325896220506681345 2020-11-10 04:21:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bryan700 What are they going to do, don their masks and hoodies and rush the WH with AR-15s?  That would solve some problems although it would take a long time to clean up the mess.  Seriously, that would be a mistake anarchists (whoever that includes) would only make once.
1325895501883998208 2020-11-10 04:18:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Hoosiers1986 @crazycatkid @FoxNews Yup, got sick of them after they hired Brazile and a few others &amp; subbed to @OANN.  It is wonderful.  I finally cut the string 11/04.   I tried @newsmax &amp; it is so good it blew me out.  So now I have OANN &amp; Newsmax and @FoxNews is a bad memory.  Sad, some good people still there.
1325893694621274112 2020-11-10 04:11:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @smarteet @JamesSpringer80 @Breaking911 TY, :-)
1325892847317340160 2020-11-10 04:07:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JamesSpringer80 @Breaking911 Been waiting for that Bull Shot.  Yeah we cheated, committed fraud, had the dead vote, had multiple votes, threw away Trump votes, rigged the computer software, and on and on and on.  But it wasn't enough to change the results 🤣.  Besides we always cheat, so what is the big deal
1325891851853864960 2020-11-10 04:03:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Breaking911 Does that rotund mook know that the dirty MSM called the election for Biden based on those illegal votes?  Votes tallied by his crew.  Some people did something.  No, a ton of Democrats did a lot of somethings to STEAL THE ELECTION.  Massive criminal DEMOCRAT ELECTION FRAUD.
1325890828057767939 2020-11-10 03:59:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RaediantWarrior @papacass84 I think most everyone sees it by now except possibly for some drugged out or incredibly stupid leftist sheeple.  The key is that the Democrat base wants to win and does not care if it is by criminal methods that screw over other Americans.  They embrace DEMOCRAT ELECTION FRAUD.
1325889816202936322 2020-11-10 03:55:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @mschlapp @AdamLaxalt If it has to do with Democrat Election Fraud, nothing is shocking.
1325862175357874176 2020-11-10 02:05:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NVGOP @delyju @ClarkCountyNV WTF is the cop doing in the background, also lying to the guy trying to vote?  The corruption is deep there.
1325861661371064321 2020-11-10 02:03:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NVGOP @delyju @ClarkCountyNV The @ClarkCountyNV official needs to see some jail time, at least 10 years.
1325860851274846208 2020-11-10 02:00:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ThundersQn @zeusFanHouse Will our great oath takers, our vets, support an illegitimate pretender to the Presidency?  Will they submit to Democrat Election Fraud?  To our vets, thank you.  You are loved and appreciated.
1325860300688556032 2020-11-10 01:58:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Jali_Cat @Mikeh801 @IsraeliPM @netanyahu I have been a fan and supporter for years.  This makes me sick and I reject @netanyahu .  Wow, what a sad day.  Maybe Israel does need new leadership.
1325858315465748480 2020-11-10 01:50:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Maximus_4EVR @JoJo111USA We know who won.  Don't need the Surpreme Court to tell us.
1325857448842862592 2020-11-10 01:47:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Rasmussen_Poll @WingsofCrystal @BreitbartNews Fair enough, I deleted Bret Baier.  @OANN and @newsmax are top notch and bring complete and HONEST NEWS.
1325857098115244034 2020-11-10 01:45:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Rasmussen_Poll @WingsofCrystal @realDonaldTrump How can someone with a 52% approval rating coming off of a 33+% quarterly GDP growth &amp; who has just brought the ME closer to peace than it has ever been lose the election to a brain dead corrupt criminal bigot who did not bother to campaign?  DEMORAT ELECTION FRAUD, that is how.
1325856291852439552 2020-11-10 01:42:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods @aughunt Biden is one of the most corrupt and evil racial bigot to make it to the big stage.  Thanks to massive Democrat Election Fraud, he is now claiming the Presidency.  That claim will fail.
1325853815023677440 2020-11-10 01:32:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bitsy423 Guy has Biden sign, rabid rodent mob attacks.  Sorry sign guy, you got what you deserve.    So if that is how they treat their "own", can I dismiss the kinder bull 💩?
1325834594218774534 2020-11-10 00:16:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @pjcobbrocks5 @Herbert_L_Reed @realDonaldTrump Ever feel betrayed and dirtied?

1325828872097603585 2020-11-09 23:53:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @seanhannity @curious1102 I think you need to check to see if all of the elderly and helpless people that Cuomo killed off this year ended up voting for Biden.
1325827930350481410 2020-11-09 23:49:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @pam_sands @Sundncefn @POTUS @gatewaypundit Will the military, sworn to uphold the constitution and fight enemies foreign and DOMESTIC, obey the orders of an illegitimate president.  Asking for the people who legally elected Trump.
1325826805991813120 2020-11-09 23:45:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Herbert_L_Reed @realDonaldTrump Well there is always Germany and France congratulating Biden.
1325825668001619968 2020-11-09 23:40:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @prayingmedic @thechief1962 You bet, the Deep State, MSM, Social Media, Google, Marxists, Communists, haters, and pure evil all threw in and bet the house on Democrat Election Fraud.  They have no where to hide.  One thing about Trump, he brought the DC / Media / Big Tech corruption out into the open.
1325824759112720389 2020-11-09 23:37:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dkrwilliams @JackPosobiec So 20,000 votes flipped in under 45 seconds.  How does the number of votes credited go down as voting continues?  Another technical glitch?  Human error?  And why does all this always fall in Biden's favor?
1325823720015851520 2020-11-09 23:33:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DHochleutner Just out of curiosity, how long would it take to starve NYC and LA out?
1325823526469734404 2020-11-09 23:32:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HashtagHag13 @DHochleutner @Mickeegee2020 Hahahaha  Well said.
1325823336950034432 2020-11-09 23:31:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal @LouDobbs If true, how wonderful.  I am done totally with @FoxNews and was going to miss the great @LouDobbs .  My salute to his courage and determination.  Just a few more and @FoxNews will have lower ratings that the Butt Waxing Network and deservedly so.
1325822725714141184 2020-11-09 23:29:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MittRomney Phuck you.  You are an ugly insult to the wonderful people and state of Utah.
1325822199563911168 2020-11-09 23:26:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JoeFreedomLove How long into a Biden Presidency (may Satan and Soros not have their way, spit) before war breaks out in the ME?
1325821347730059264 2020-11-09 23:23:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mspdcali @gatewaypundit Hope they own a lot of shares in Fox.  The pounding coming will be classic.
1325821105249034240 2020-11-09 23:22:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealWayneRoot @willbarrett_1 @realDonaldTrump This scenario is without addressing the fundamental and massive Democrat Election Fraud.
1325819311605182465 2020-11-09 23:15:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DonaldJTrumpJr If I were the businesses, I would not tear down the boards yet.  1st, we are seeing riots and attacks in cities like Portland even though with the authority vested in it @FoxNews called for Biden, and  2nd, Biden lost &amp; when legal votes are counted &amp; honestly tabulated Trump wins
1325818139741835266 2020-11-09 23:10:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal In case Civil War breaks out as a result of the massive Democrat Election Fraud, the City Folk plan on being self sufficient.
1325781168357220352 2020-11-09 20:43:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal Is the rumor that the people of NYC are going to grow their own food, raise livestock, and use their middle fingers to wipe their butts true?
1325778280339763200 2020-11-09 20:32:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Have to go for a little while, so I will leave you with one thought:  DEMOCRAT ELECTION FRAUD!
1325778015159136257 2020-11-09 20:31:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MarciaW02564145 @TABYTCHI Clearly Biden has no conscience.  Rather you have to look at the situation and ask, "What would a feral rat do?"  For example, would Biden cut a deal to sell out the Democrat Election Fraud to save himself and his family?
1325776769333391361 2020-11-09 20:26:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DougSides @VLovesAnimals Democrat Election Fraud.  Aided by:  MSM? Tech Giants? Vote Counting Machine Company owners?
1325776135221768197 2020-11-09 20:23:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DineshDSouza @Chuck122049 Yup.  Who is going to try to cut a deal first to save their a$$?
1325775163216982016 2020-11-09 20:20:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TABYTCHI @MarciaW02564145 LOL, I don't know that that is true.  Never believe anonymous sources without proof.  But I will say that if I was a Democrat Election Fraudster in the thick of it, I might be wondering if I should try to cut a deal now, early and save my a##.
1325774324188393473 2020-11-09 20:16:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @hucklebee_sarah @CocoThePatriot I think that when this is over many Americans will wonder if any Democrat was legally elected.
1325773602168340480 2020-11-09 20:13:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MarciaW02564145 Not if the votes are tallied in PA and the same computer programs are used to count them.  Was he legally elected this first time?
1325772637281292288 2020-11-09 20:10:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 @KittyBigSlick Agreed.
1325772546331996160 2020-11-09 20:09:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BarnettforAZ @shelbydoll1 Trump is quickly closing in on Biden in AZ with a large number of votes to be counted all now without looking at the massive Democrat Election Fraud.  Once that is addressed Trump will have taken AZ by a large margine.  PS - Phuck @foxnews
1325771832423718914 2020-11-09 20:06:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DavidJHarrisJr @andy_legault Silly geese.  Corrupt and criminal Democrat AGs never resign, they just hold tight and commit Democrat Election Fraud.
1325771034318942208 2020-11-09 20:03:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> It is becoming clear that there has been so much Democrat Election Fraud in so many ways and in so many places that it will take lifetimes to unravel it all.
1325766699782565888 2020-11-09 19:46:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealZaneFrost @LyndaG1963 @iheartmindy It is clear that the Democrat Election Fraud people fudged the numbers.  How can a candidates vote count go down as more votes are tallied?  How can 20,000 votes magically jump for one candidate to the other.  This is a clear indication of Democrat Election Fraud.
1325764883833483265 2020-11-09 19:39:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @1776Stonewall @QuintonWard10 No, that is only one aspect of the Democrat Election Fraud.  Trump should be leading by way more than 122,000 Legal votes.
1325764628194844677 2020-11-09 19:38:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 @CocoThePatriot There should be a trail to follow that demonstrates conspiracy to steal the election.  I bet the NSA has some interesting phone records.
1325763892656529409 2020-11-09 19:35:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lavist1 In a Marxist totalitarian state it does not matter if the people believe in the process.  The government rules by power of arms not by the consent of the governed.  Democrat Election Fraud is our entry into that world.
1325761479912484864 2020-11-09 19:25:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MattBraynard @WingsofCrystal We were pleased to donate toward your effort and look forward to seeing the results.
1325615590120189952 2020-11-09 09:46:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @haveaconcern None.  What is the chance if they see things start to go real bad that some will try to make a deal and throw the others under the bus?
1325612041025941504 2020-11-09 09:31:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Yes, we have the guns.  We also grow and transport the food.  We control the flow of water, electricity, and goods.  Truth is that the Biden Democrat Election Fraud is centered in cities that cannot survive long without the people they are trying to subjugate.
1325611192119820289 2020-11-09 09:28:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jimenez_wally I hope to God that it does not come to that.  Will America go down to Democrat Election Fraud with a weak whimper or will there be a fight?  Will the military and police follow orders of an illegitimate "President" or keep faith to their oaths taken under the eyes of God.  cont..
1325606691216400385 2020-11-09 09:10:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ABC Didn't Bush refuse and end up taking FL and winning?  You guys really su#k, don't you?
1325604966552072192 2020-11-09 09:03:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> This has been blocked from retweet, see if it works on my account.  If I am banned I will be on Parler tomorrow.   https://t.co/FDCC3HOzqL
1325603971696746496 2020-11-09 08:59:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Will we end our existence in a Marxist dictatorship without representation, or will we continue to exist where, "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."?
1325603970987913216 2020-11-09 08:59:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> As we wait to see whether extensive Democrat Election Fraud will bring our country to its cruel end we may want to ponder these words at its founding:  "whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it..."
1325598499463856128 2020-11-09 08:38:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LarrySchweikart Remember that is before recount and vote validation and review of tossed Sharpie ballots and voting dead etc.
1325579666418139137 2020-11-09 07:23:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Allys73179554 And yet if the Democrat Election Fraud holds, George Soros will be the defacto president of the United States.  Pretty impressive rise for someone who spent his youth picking over the remains of his fellow Jews for he Nazis.
1325577308720173056 2020-11-09 07:13:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gsamu53 @gatewaypundit Bush appointed Roberts who has betrayed the country any number of times and is somewhat responsible for the mess that we are in.  Bush is part of the Deep State and a traitor to the country that he swore to God to defend.
1325576767868862464 2020-11-09 07:11:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods @RLiberalskiddin @AOC When the last LEGAL ballot is HONESTLY counted and Trump is reelected, we will see how much harmony they want.
1325576361134579719 2020-11-09 07:10:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RepAndyBiggsAZ @toby_dorena @realDonaldTrump It was a pleasure to vote for you.
1325576124248645632 2020-11-09 07:09:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BernieSanders No do it with LEGAL votes.
1325567464369922048 2020-11-09 06:34:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Hoosiers1986 Yes
1325567122529951744 2020-11-09 06:33:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EddieDonovan @CNN &amp; @FoxNews does.
1325566777389010945 2020-11-09 06:32:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CNNPolitics Other than a load of #fakenews , who declared Biden the winner.  Anyone with the authority to do so?  @CNN
1325565799197675521 2020-11-09 06:28:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @roxyloveslucy @Ratut65 Good point.
1325565664334000130 2020-11-09 06:27:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Ratut65 Fluck Fox   @FoxNews .  I switched to @OANN and @newsmax .
1325554773727178752 2020-11-09 05:44:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Annakhait @GuttzyGal It does make you wonder.  God took Ginsburg at exactly the right time.  Roberts is a compromised Bush guy (Bush already congratulated Biden).
1325551623272239104 2020-11-09 05:31:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GeorgiaPine8 The Arizona ballots, fake Democrat Election Fraud ballots, should not be to hard to track down since the only mail in was absentee on request.
1325551171977687040 2020-11-09 05:30:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GeorgiaPine8 My guess is that under close inspection they will all say, 'printed in China"  Just being sarcastic of course, but it is not that far fetched.
1325550566135656449 2020-11-09 05:27:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @steve_c1970 His master is pleased.  But it ain't over yet.  As a matter of fact, it has only just begun.  https://t.co/Zd2EAoosX0
1325550129122697216 2020-11-09 05:25:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CNNPolitics Dear #FakeNews network, @CNN.  Biden is not President Elect.  Stop spreading the BS, stop the propaganda, just stop it.  All you are doing is fooling the moronic sheeple and making everyone else very mad.
1325545565476696065 2020-11-09 05:07:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Heather89064435 @haveaconcern @fingurlECG @CNN I agree.  All LEGAL citizens are stake holders in America and the country is bound to us by contract; the constitution.  We have a valid interest in an honest and open election.
1325544468087386114 2020-11-09 05:03:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DineshDSouza No, we are ready to fight.  And by that I do not mean gang attacking a little old lady from behind like the Antifa / BLM thugs are wont to do.
1325543763905687552 2020-11-09 05:00:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AlexMarlow Lets face it, the Tech Giants were so effective in their propaganda and manipulation that it took a HUGE amount of Democrat Election Fraud to make believe that Biden won.  Now by suppressing all discussion, or so they think, they are making the cheat &amp; their part more obvious.
1325542715283574784 2020-11-09 04:56:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MichaelJFell You will get the money once @FoxNews calls it for you.
1325542096971816960 2020-11-09 04:53:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kylie_oneil75 @BreitbartNews I am going to take a real shot in the dark and guess that the "Issue" / "Glitch" / "Oopsie" favored Biden.
1325540704626503680 2020-11-09 04:48:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @heatherjones333 @FoxNews I will respectfully disagree.  Especially if Trump holds.  There are issues of election interference to the harm of America and it's people and the question of the harm done in the Arizona call.  If the @FoxNews stock tanks because of what was done, a shareholder suit is possible
1325538020821364736 2020-11-09 04:37:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Christi54465705 @Avenger2Toxic @VeronicaCrossUK I get it as one of the stations on Cox.  Check your cable listings.
1325537610047971328 2020-11-09 04:36:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BrandonStraka Wow, big dude cold cocks and punches out loud mouth girl.  You did not have to identify that it was Biden people and BLM, it was obvious.
1325536920433172480 2020-11-09 04:33:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @charliekirk11 More than half.  I am sure many Democrats think that we are seeing extreme Democrat Election Fraud and approve.
1325536570737221632 2020-11-09 04:32:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LABeachGal1 The next few weeks will be something.  Trump called this years in advance and talked about it ove the months leading up to election day.  He and his people were not caught unaware nor surprised.  I wonder what his plan is.
1325535674104049664 2020-11-09 04:28:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @heatherjones333 Hopefully that tweet will be saved for when the law suits and charges hits @FoxNews and the elites running it for their election manipulation.  The station perhaps should have it's broadcast license pulled.
1325534808261357568 2020-11-09 04:25:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit Phuck her.
1325505372413571073 2020-11-09 02:28:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KikiTheUntamed1 @BlueSeaSailing We the People consent to be governed.  Remove the consent through overt Democrat Election Fraud and you have a Marxist dictatorship enforced by arms.
1325505027050369024 2020-11-09 02:26:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LABeachGal1 "FIX", 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1325504885303881728 2020-11-09 02:26:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mallen2010 Not sure, I think that they have left over ballots from MI &amp; WI that they can use.  All they have to do is change the names and then check he boxes.  Easy enough at 4:00AM.
1325504252920307715 2020-11-09 02:23:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto Sorry to hear.
1325503960405344256 2020-11-09 02:22:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @thebradfordfile So what.  Let them riot.  How many times can you burn down Portland or Minneapolis or other vibrant Democrat Election Fraud run cities?  If the local police can't handle rioting thugs, the cities need to be torn down.
1325499730873339904 2020-11-09 02:05:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @magajcs Perhaps, but I am not sure that it is not widespread.  Consider the counties in the states which had votes tallied by the tainted Dominion Software.  Consider the postal workers caught trashing ballots.  I think it will be brain boggling when the truth comes out.
1325499058421604352 2020-11-09 02:02:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Evan45Mike @MicheleKozal @gatewaypundit The Democrat Election Fraud will not stand.  40,000+ ballots in Arizona (my state) with only Biden marked and no other candidate or issue is beyond the realm of belief.  Arizona is Trump country and he and McSally won and I will be dammed if the Democrats will steal my state.
1325497169562923008 2020-11-09 01:55:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @IselaBlancAZ @DrPaulGosar @dougducey @Leo4AzHouse @FannKfann I don't know who the phuck you are but you do not speak form me or anyone else I know.  Shut up and sit down.  The fact that there was massive Democrat Election Fraud in Arizona is both obvious and true and needs to be fixed.  We have a right to a fair &amp; honest election in AZ.
1325496399081869313 2020-11-09 01:52:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DrPaulGosar @redstatenation @dougducey @Leo4AzHouse @FannKfann As citizens of Arizona, my family and myself second that call.  @dougducey  time to deliver the truth and an honest election in our state.
1325495875985002497 2020-11-09 01:50:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @thebradfordfile @gatewaypundit Defie belief unless you are a college educated liberal.
1325495728085508096 2020-11-09 01:49:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit @LibertarianBlue @BreitbartNews Two observations:  1 How much longer does Tucker have?  @FoxNews &amp; the Marxist elites he described cannot let him go on telling the truth  2 If the "Big-Tech" moth balls were so effective, why the massive Democrat Election Fraud?  It seems that their message was rejected by most.
1325488909401255936 2020-11-09 01:22:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit @100PercFEDUP @joehoft While OUR military men &amp; women, overseas &amp; in America were sacrificing much &amp; putting it all on the line to protect our country, the Democrat Election Fraud Party was stealing their votes.  Committing illegal acts agaist them.  That is plain disgusting and as low as you can go.
1325473935354257409 2020-11-09 00:23:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Peoples_Pundit @WingsofCrystal Every American is a stake holder in the election and it's outcome.  We are guaranteed representation as the rock base of our country and a vote taken by Democrat Election Fraud denies that basic right.
1325473109537796096 2020-11-09 00:19:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MsMaggieMaye @WingsofCrystal @prayingmedic Big loss if you do not take big risks.  It comes down to strategy &amp; I am sure that Trump knows what he is doing.  He will have all the money he needs, crap he could self fund if he wants.  Simple truth, no way Biden or Kelly won in Arizona.  All sorts of irregularities + Hammer.
1325451241749536768 2020-11-08 22:52:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NetworksManager @FriendlyJMC @realDonaldTrump Wow, outright fraud by @twitter?
1325449187341733888 2020-11-08 22:44:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @nypost C'Mon man.  Just when I was beginning to think you guys were real and you come out with that shit.
1325448607206567936 2020-11-08 22:42:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EliLake Bull Shit!  Biden did not win.  I would not accept defeat by Democrat Election Fraud in any case but the fight has just begun.  The battle just begun.  Do you offer your sexual assault victims a cigarette and ask if it was good for them too?
1325447445661114370 2020-11-08 22:37:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @greggutfeld I am blocking you because you are a sell out and a$$hole.  Everything you have been saying for years is so much bull.  When the choice had to be made you went for the money.  Block the fool.
1325446860371156995 2020-11-08 22:35:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SamySabbagh @OSeanessyTweet @greggutfeld You can sub @OANN and stream it.  We are subs.  I believe that they have a free trial.  @newsmax is included in most cable packages.  We get it on Cox  I like both and find both better than @FoxNews.  They have different styles and I like both.  It depends on what you prefer.
1325433602369155072 2020-11-08 21:42:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marklevinshow Maybe they are flying in another batch of votes from China so @FoxNews considers the two states undecided at the moment.
1325428608647655424 2020-11-08 21:23:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @greggutfeld In the end, you are a bought pussy.  Once a fan, I feel sad.    @FoxNews will never be on our TVs.  @newsmax &amp; @OANN (I subbed) in my house.  Give Juan a kiss and bye.
1325427487904419841 2020-11-08 21:18:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @paulamjohns @SBarr05299608 @TuckerCarIson_ @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Not real tucker account.
1325427379850731520 2020-11-08 21:18:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mkolken @donhum47 Sorry for your loss.  We went through the gruesome cancer fight but were more fortunate than you.  May she RIP.
1325426854812020737 2020-11-08 21:16:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Observant_mind @petefrt In the way that may be good.  Bring the fight into the open.  And you are correct, the fraud is being exposed and countered and I don't believe Trump has even started.  He has been calling this for years and I must believe that he was well prepared.
1325419082594705413 2020-11-08 20:45:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Crossbearer1956 Watch this Watch this Watch this  Especially at the end where she talks about the 4:00AM van arrival with 61 crates of ballots that were impossible to have been counted at the time the update in votes count was done.
1325417128711790593 2020-11-08 20:37:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KarenMy26623876 @robbipl @gatewaypundit Watch this Watch this Watch this.  Especially the end where she describes the arrival of 61 crates of ballots by van at 4:00AM after everyone was sent home and then the announcement of the count before it was physically impossible to have counted them all.  Easy to prove fraud.
1325414609356910594 2020-11-08 20:27:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wsoxwinyes @SpinePainBegone @gatewaypundit Watch her statement.  Watch it.  It tells exactly what happened.  Listen to the end carefully.  And the kicker is, that all she says about the mystery 4:00 AM delivery can be verified by payroll records of the vote counters &amp; then their testimony "under oath".
1325413952038203398 2020-11-08 20:24:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wsoxwinyes @SpinePainBegone @gatewaypundit 2/2  ...to count the ballots in the time between delivery &amp; the announcement of the updated results.  The workers had been sent home.  A simple audit of payroll records would substantiate this and then speaking to the people who were supposedly doing the count would do it.
1325413304462790656 2020-11-08 20:22:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wsoxwinyes @SpinePainBegone @gatewaypundit 1//2  Wow, listen to the video of the oriental election observer.  She nails the continuing fraud all during the day's count and then the big fraud in the wee hours of the morning when the ballots mysteriously appear.  She makes the point that it was physically impossible ...
1325406664728563713 2020-11-08 19:55:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @patriotinla @alan_alannlane @FoxNews One thing that you can do while still on is block all of their advertisers.
1325406548256980995 2020-11-08 19:55:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AlexIsStanding @SBarr05299608 Sorry, I would celebrate too, but this is a fake account.
1325406411409387523 2020-11-08 19:54:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TuckerCarIson_ @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Fake account.
1325406238167846912 2020-11-08 19:54:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RedinBlue5 @toby_dorena Nope, already over at @newsmax and @OANN (sub).  There will be both a drop and a realignment away from many and much away from @FoxNews.
1325405728866136067 2020-11-08 19:52:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @OzraeliAvi @ConservativeTht They just need the time to build their lists and collect guns.
1325405400364056577 2020-11-08 19:50:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LLinWood @Jinger_Ellie Jail time for all.  Biden may beat the rap by claiming mental incompetence (easily established) and he did not know what was going on.
1325405027477843969 2020-11-08 19:49:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Mareq16 @LyndaG1963 Ever get the feeling that the printing presses in China were smoking a few months ago?
1325404528858992640 2020-11-08 19:47:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JudgeJeaninefan @2Guilbeau That was in one county.  If all counties are added up, you may flip the state right there without having to look at all of the fake ballots which should be done anyway.
1325403932219224067 2020-11-08 19:44:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tom2badcat I think that I would be trying to be in first to make a deal.  Election Fraud carries stiff jail time and each vote is one case.  Figure out the sentence involved in 1,000,000 bogus ballots in a state (say PA, MI, or WI for example) at 5 years each.
1325402679275708417 2020-11-08 19:39:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced @2Guilbeau I am on Parler and will be leaving @twitter when everything is over.
1325402089510481921 2020-11-08 19:37:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @1776Stonewall @2Guilbeau I bet they all went big for Biden.
1325401364285984768 2020-11-08 19:34:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods @SmokieMtnsWendy Indeed, I would not be invested in American business right now (unless of course they have a large presence in China).
1325401089051516928 2020-11-08 19:33:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KellzBellzzah @robbipl Indeed, all of the prior elections over the last few decades are now in question.  Did Obama really win?  Did the Democrats really take the House in 2018?  How many Democrat DAs, AGs, State Officials, actually won election?  America is on the precipice because everyone now knows.
1325400059211522049 2020-11-08 19:29:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Crimsontider @chliberty Think it was a computer glitch?
1325399086325854208 2020-11-08 19:25:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DavidLimbaugh @WvTrump The only recourse against being taken over as a Communist Dictatorship will lie through #2A.
1325392068013813760 2020-11-08 18:57:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BeschlossDC They are.  Would you have the president lie?
1325391677532508161 2020-11-08 18:56:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NickAdamsinUSA No

1325254744936386563 2020-11-08 09:52:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal Wow, I feel special.  I never tweeted about him and never know that grossly overpaid moron knew I existed.  My thanks to @BretBaier for the block.  I have blocked @FoxNews and you for starters.
1325246411093372928 2020-11-08 09:19:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GOPChairwoman @flatwalk @KLoeffler It is my understanding that the Georgia @DNC already has 2,000,000 mail in ballots for Warnock to be deployed at 3:00AM the evening following the election when Warnock is down 1,999,999 votes.  GOP poll watchers will be blinded with lasers.  That is my prediction anyway.
1325244891266347008 2020-11-08 09:12:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal Oh wow.  A paid sell out of the country has blocked me.  I will never sleep again.  PS - @newsmax is great, why waste time with a hack?
1325243723559571456 2020-11-08 09:08:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> When you know you are doing something right.   https://t.co/TWbkr3QSrC
1325236849175003136 2020-11-08 08:41:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @_Steve_777 LOL, I did.  We watch @FoxNews voluntarily.  They derive a big profit from that.  There is no reason why we have to.  They were the place to go for truth and honest reporting.  No longer.
1325236114592997376 2020-11-08 08:38:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Truth1sfreedom @ErinMacAdams This puts the Military and the LEOs in a bind.  They are sworn to protect the country.  Will they allow it and them to be handed over to China?
1325235619107205121 2020-11-08 08:36:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealMattCouch @ladymil14 I blocked @FoxNews on @twitter.  I highly recommend that everyone do the same.
1325235376340967424 2020-11-08 08:35:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KylieJaneKremer @pjpaton @FoxNews I missed it.  I was watching @newsmax
1325232793001943040 2020-11-08 08:24:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @britektire @reubing I blocked them
1325232634906120192 2020-11-08 08:24:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 @SHEILAFLINT1 I just blocked @FoxNews.  I recommend that to everyone.
1325219996843220992 2020-11-08 07:34:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BenjiBacker I call BullShit.
1325219632928546816 2020-11-08 07:32:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> I am and I blocked them on @twitter.  I would recommend that everyone who feels betrayed by @FoxNews block them here.
1325218556615651328 2020-11-08 07:28:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FogCityMidge @SmallBiz4Trump @JudgeJeanine I just blocked @FoxNews &amp; will be watching @NewsMax and @OANN.  You see, Fox derives it's income from me (not any more) and I expect honest quality news in return and Fox is giving neither.  We will see who benefits from their actions.  Hope the Judge ends up on @NewsMax or @OANN
1325198716387557376 2020-11-08 06:09:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @USMCMIL03 Will the US Military surrender to China without a shot being fired?
1325197925614379009 2020-11-08 06:06:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump More.  The Democrat Election Fraud likely destroyed many of your votes.  The fraudulent count of your votes by "glitched" software also cut your numbers
1325188714096517121 2020-11-08 05:29:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @clarissamehler @MartinDodge4 Also tell him that he is going to spend the rest of his life supporting them.

1325186118858403841 2020-11-08 05:19:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto @reubing Give her ten years for each  count unless she drops a dime on everyone involved.
1325185883528597506 2020-11-08 05:18:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DaileyOfficial No, because of massive Democrat Election Fraud.
1325183391646404608 2020-11-08 05:08:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TomFitton @NorCalCrush The Supreme Court needs to start jailing those clowns for contempt or the justices can hang up their robes and go home.
1325182750878396418 2020-11-08 05:06:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @toddstarnes @_Mama_Doc It is not like the Supreme Court is relevant to Democrats engaged in Election Fraud if they don't have the majority.  But it is OK, MSM says so.
1325182451988062216 2020-11-08 05:04:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Just logged on to @AOL to check my email and they had a banner headline that Biden was elected president.  That is an out and out lie and the left is pushing hard in their propaganda blitz.  What a crock.
1325182014262140929 2020-11-08 05:03:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Daryayie @SmokieMtnsWendy No way Biden even came close in Arizona.  Massive Election Fraud.
1325181618357628933 2020-11-08 05:01:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec @SmokieMtnsWendy I am starting to wonder if the 2018 Senate election in Arizona was rigged too.  Is there any way to go back and look at it?
1325175780322668550 2020-11-08 04:38:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JWSNMNJ @RealMattCouch Truth, the people on both sides mean 💩 to the powers that be.  Democrat Election Fraud.
1325175336456183808 2020-11-08 04:36:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NewportLost @vivelafra Never been more true or obvious than these last few days.
1325174685588283393 2020-11-08 04:34:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RussOnPolitics @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump Another difference is that the dead show up and vote for Democrats. Computer "glitches" show up and vote for Democrats. People who do not exist, show up and vote for Democrats, and  People who vote for Republicans have their votes dissapeared.  I can go further, but you get it.
1325174205608914944 2020-11-08 04:32:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump By the power vested in the MSM by the MSM and Deep State, they hereby declare Biden, King, Dictator, and President of the United States.  What the MSM declares to be true let no one challenge for honesty.  I smell desperation.  AZ, GA, MI, WI, NV, and PA will be challenged.
1325172002697605120 2020-11-08 04:23:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @OptionDrone @ScottPresler Sorry, after four years, I hve had it with morons and their bullshit up to the rim.  Bye and block to you.
1325171586614190084 2020-11-08 04:21:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @roxyloveslucy Truth, the people of the US will be royally screwed &amp; the world will be dragged down.  That is not healthy &amp; the scenario in which wars start  Just as Trump was bringing peace to the ME, Democrat Election Fraud threatens world peace.  Sickening!  Will China move on a Biden admin?
1325146740408815617 2020-11-08 02:42:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal And yet, and yet, the MSM, Pox on Fox, called it and called the election for Biden.

1325146219459403778 2020-11-08 02:40:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bryan700 To the Philly Mayor:  Will you be putting on your big boy pants when you are nailed for Democrat Election Fraud?
1325145999719886848 2020-11-08 02:40:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @USMCMIL03 @FoxNews @FoxNews is toast.  LOL, is their faux call based on AZ for Biden because it is going to flip to Trump.  Getting real close even with all the Democrat Election Fraud involved and before the criminal Democrat operation is investigated.
1325145280883253248 2020-11-08 02:37:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ScottPresler There are two different views of this.  We see people protesting Democrat Election Fraud.  Democrats see people to phuck over on the way to taking what they want.
1325144832457596933 2020-11-08 02:35:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @American1299 PS - If the House turns red, I have a suggestion as to where Pelosi can insert her gavel.
1325144668120625154 2020-11-08 02:34:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @American1299 Agreed, but the software "glitch" like spanned all candidates and elections.
1325142763273244672 2020-11-08 02:27:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GiannoCaldwell @_Mama_Doc LOL, how many Biden supporters do?
1325142657513893889 2020-11-08 02:26:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal @SidneyPowell1 LOL, very good and accurate too.  She is the best and has joined the team of the best.
1325139769295208449 2020-11-08 02:15:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @pnjaban @tracybeanz @realDonaldTrump When the election is settled, it will be necessary to look at the officers of the media companies to determine if there was a plot to undermine the American elections.
1325139431624372224 2020-11-08 02:13:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @nascarred14 @Emmita17E @RacieSicilian The MSM just committed suicide right before our eyes.
1325139294290235393 2020-11-08 02:13:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @American1299 I think we need to look at all of the House &amp; Senate congressional races to see the level of Democrat Election Fraud going on there.
1325138908124868611 2020-11-08 02:11:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @roxyloveslucy Now add to that computer "glitches", destroyed Trump ballots, voting dead, changed ballots, and God knows what else.  Millions of people in Pennsylvania and throughout the energy industry will have their jobs lost and lives destroyed by the criminal Democrats.  That is so wrong.
1325138016457777157 2020-11-08 02:08:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @pamelaggs @Jan99464119 The blatant and almost instantaneous turn of @FoxNews to totally the dark side is shocking.  I wonder how long that this was planned.
1325137331737620485 2020-11-08 02:05:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sxdoc @TheMetroMutt @JohnBrennan Neither does fake mail in ballets and program glitches.
1325137072345153539 2020-11-08 02:04:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JohnRuddick2 Because they are afraid.  Do you smell the desperation.  The extreme Democrat Election Fraud is coming apart.    The MSM part of the criminal operation is trying to head off what is coming with a pre-emptive strike.  Like an Iranian missile they have hit themselves.
1325135356832837635 2020-11-08 01:57:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @paulsperry_ @vickib501 Ten years for each of them.
1325134864350240769 2020-11-08 01:55:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SaraCarterDC I though this was a satire, a bad one, at first.  Then I found out that it is the real thing.  OMG
1325134154242027522 2020-11-08 01:52:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SebGorka @JoeBiden @FoxNews Not watching and don't care what those two clowns do.  Every time they want a scumbag on, they call on @MittRomney
1325133897131196416 2020-11-08 01:51:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @superyayadize @BlueSeaSailing I wonder if he is going to end up in jail for election fraud.
1325133648467693569 2020-11-08 01:50:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DeanBrowningPA LOL, if Biden carries through that may exactly be your dining option.  Venezuela Cuba Chinese famine after Commie takeover, . . . .
1325132864187322368 2020-11-08 01:47:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marklevinshow @sioxielegend She probably should have held that intention in secret until they disarmed us all.
1325131478276079619 2020-11-08 01:42:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @newtgingrich @Emmita17E I don't know how others are viewing this declaration by the MSM, but to me it reeks of desperation.  The Election Fraud Democrats &amp; their flunkies in the MSM are trying to declare victory &amp; shut things down because the smell the loss coming and perhaps with it serious jail time.
1325112625143836674 2020-11-08 00:27:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealMattCouch Arizona is to within 20,000 votes which is easily a Hammer and Scorecard software "glitch".
1325112413495021568 2020-11-08 00:26:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dbongino @debaroo54 Yet they did not work.  Trump won by a landslide which is why the Democrat Election Fraud is so extensive.
1325112191771537408 2020-11-08 00:25:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec @debaroo54 Or their gun loaded?
1325112117754617856 2020-11-08 00:25:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cvpayne Thanks.  We need all of the sane and honest voices to be raised.  Anyone who sees my tweet, consider following @cvpayne .  Thank you.
1325111516656410625 2020-11-08 00:22:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @reubing If they do the only way I would know is if they announce it on @Newsmax or @OANN or someone tweets it.  Signed Ex loyal @FoxNews viewer.  PS - 20,000 is well within the margin of the "glitch" software on the counting machines which are used in AZ.
1325110738218745856 2020-11-08 00:19:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bubblebathgirl Depends on whether the kids were his.
1325110507062218752 2020-11-08 00:18:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto Guy is as dirty as an unwiped @@@@ and twice less appealing.  He is the poster boy for Democrat corruption and a leader in the PA election fraud.
1325110007617105921 2020-11-08 00:16:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Acosta And the tooth fairy told me that you put the strangest things in your mouth.  I bet my source is better than yours.
1325109747398266881 2020-11-08 00:15:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Herbert_L_Reed Sounds like she has gone full totalitarian Marxist.  A cabbage patch Commie.  Has she announced when she is going, with the Bernie people, to start building the Gulags?
1325109320309043200 2020-11-08 00:14:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump Yes you did.
1325086543845879809 2020-11-07 22:43:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BreitbartNews One starts to wonder if the House was really won by the Democrats in 2018.  Maybe Pelosi is as illegitimate as she seems.  One starts to wonder if Clinton won the popular vote in 2016.  It appears that the Democrats are a criminal organization disenfranchising the American people
1325085396925997057 2020-11-07 22:39:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @heatherjones333 @Lrihendry Simple, programs do what people code them to do.  I was head of R&amp;D of a software firm a number of years ago and this "glitch" stuff is pure lie (Democart) and Bull Shit.
1325084901587128321 2020-11-07 22:37:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @reubing @Newsmax actually thanked its viewers for tuning in during a news show I was watching last night.  Blew my mind.  I like @newsmax and sub to @OANN.  I will never turn on one of the MSM stations and @FoxNews is dead to me.  I have even turned off local Fox affiliate.
1325084075791585280 2020-11-07 22:33:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @wmmII88 Me.
1325070710159470592 2020-11-07 21:40:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SandyForLiberty I've started.  On top of that, when this is over, I am closing down my @twitter account.  I have moved from @FoxNews, cancelled my @Netflix , stopped watching kneeling sports creeps, and am avoiding some leftist company products, buy Chinese imports only when there is no choice.
1325057592838692865 2020-11-07 20:48:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cgilmer2898 PS - When I say recount, I mean recount and AUDIT.
1325057468817309698 2020-11-07 20:48:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cgilmer2898 I want a recount of every state since the popular vote total may effect the allocation of Electors in some states  Even states that Trump won may show down ballot fraud  We have come to the point that the election system is so corrupted by the Democrats that nothing is believable
1325056110227697665 2020-11-07 20:42:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NoqReport @badluthifer @realDonaldTrump Easy peasy.  Impound the machines and test the software.  This is not rocket science level extensive code.
1325054953082114048 2020-11-07 20:38:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @missionisgreat @UPMHPM A Election Fraud leftist President will destroy the military &amp; give China the keys to the world.  The American military will end up being run by the #CCP.  Will the brave Americans who have volunteered to serve &amp; taken an oath to constitution &amp;  country accept that?
1325053595620843522 2020-11-07 20:32:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @prayingmedic I live in Arizona.  My wife's family is extensive and spread all over the state of Arizona.  We talk.  There is no way that Biden even came close to winning the state.  We need to look at the Senate election as well.
1325051705214447616 2020-11-07 20:25:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BrandonStraka @QuintonWard10 Here is the difference.  The Trump supporters who were @FoxNews viewers have had it and moved over to @newsmax and @OANN (I was a Fox viewer and moved).  The liberals are back to @CNN &amp; @MSNBC and would not watch Fox on a bet.  Fox shot itself in the pud.
1325049862765699078 2020-11-07 20:18:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @oUSA_JEDIo If this is not corrected, we have no country.
1325049106062979073 2020-11-07 20:14:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @illdiscourse @recyclecongres1 @MittRomney .
1325048917579321345 2020-11-07 20:14:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JeffLatham7 @SmallBiz4Trump Besides that "glitch" would have most likely been detected through testing and on the slim chance it made it through found and corrected a long time ago in operation.  This is purposeful Democrat Election Fraud.  PS - How is it that every glitch favors Biden?
1325048378649030657 2020-11-07 20:12:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HLAurora63 @EricMMatheny @IngrahamAngle Moved over to @OANN and @newsmax .  Is she doing that?
1325047866843230208 2020-11-07 20:10:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jsolomonReports AUDIT!  Not a recount, an AUDIT.  That means that the votes must be verified as legal.    Legal votes only.  Legal votes counted correctly.  Is it to early to move Pennsylvania over to the Trump column?
1325045203611213825 2020-11-07 19:59:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EricTrump @joehos18 @realDonaldTrump Interesting side note.  Anyone still in believe that Clinton won the popular vote in 2016?
1325044148936736769 2020-11-07 19:55:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NickAdamsinUSA Any one of them legal?
1325043912117952512 2020-11-07 19:54:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FancyBitch_Here @debrataddeo Trump &amp; Barr called this a long (very long for Trump) time ago.  I cannot believe that they sat passively by and let it happen and took no proactive steps.  I look forward to seeing how it plays out.
1324893006437076993 2020-11-07 09:54:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Lrihendry Good for her.
1324887503757737984 2020-11-07 09:32:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RonaldBruceBar3 I think 10 years would be right but would settle to see a raft of people sentenced to 5 years.
1324873811045490688 2020-11-07 08:38:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @nypmetro @ThatConservativ No problem, their 50 votes for Biden have already been counted.
1324871619819446272 2020-11-07 08:29:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LarrySchweikart @CarolChupp  https://t.co/65H6blSgYw
1324857147436408832 2020-11-07 07:32:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Luna_paris @17cmkelly Every single mistake, issue, question, found crate of ballots, were Biden "votes" and benefited him.  Every single ballot found in the trash, city dumps, and other scrap heaps were Trump votes.  This cannot stand and many people, Democrats, committed election fraud and need jail.
1324855019326222337 2020-11-07 07:23:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Shelbsss_03 @TEDCLUBB3RLANG @johncardillo And where did the ballots end up?  Were the ballots counted?  Did they end up getting corrected over to Biden?  In a criminal corrupt area run by Democrats there is no guarantee that the ballots were counted and were correctly counted.
1324854331766579200 2020-11-07 07:21:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @johncardillo True.
1324854088320786432 2020-11-07 07:20:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bakoff333 Clear indication of fraud.
1324853564850630658 2020-11-07 07:17:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @UJustGotNicoled @Tia6sc @TomFitton That is not a computer glitch.  Someone had to do it.  It is pure Democrat Election Fraud.  This cannot stand.
1324852136572710912 2020-11-07 07:12:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @taraleigh3182 @sarahsmithF1 @GiannoCaldwell Because the Chinese are paying Biden to be one.  Because he is playing to the BLM / Marxist AOC wing of his corrupt criminal party.    Just guessing.  PS - I am fun, I just don't like scumbags stealing an election.  PPS - I am going to block you because Dems bore me.
1324851154484830208 2020-11-07 07:08:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joshdcaplan Like I trust those a$$wipes.  Investigating themselves.  Bull.  We need the DOJ in there stat.
1324813216887660544 2020-11-07 04:37:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bakoff333 Democrats lie about everything so no mystery there.
1324812960989024256 2020-11-07 04:36:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jsolomonReports @WingsofCrystal Will the margin increase after they remove all of the votes filled out by Democrats in a back room somewhere?
1324812737965223936 2020-11-07 04:35:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JamesOKeefeIII I hope every one of those fucking Democrats end up in jail.
1324811480567410690 2020-11-07 04:30:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @nedryun @Michael81449845 I think that much more than half the country knows this was done illegally, it is just that the Democrats approve because it was the only way that they could win.
1324804986618798081 2020-11-07 04:04:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kylie_oneil75 @gatewaypundit To gain 1,000,000 votes he would have to go at a rate of 67% over 3,000,000 ballots or 75% over 2,000,000 ballots.  Not possible.
1324796890236420096 2020-11-07 03:32:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> I can't speak for anyone else, but just being around a Democrat makes me feel dirty.  The thought of one make me feel soiled.  What scum.
1324796446592262144 2020-11-07 03:31:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NickAdamsinUSA Yes
1324783428965785601 2020-11-07 02:39:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DineshDSouza Actually, the Supreme Count will become meaningless and useless.
1324782926949572608 2020-11-07 02:37:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 @scott_helmick @FoxNews I'm done with @FoxNews.
1324782695818256384 2020-11-07 02:36:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Jordan_Q_ @debaroo54 Send it on to the Trump team.  It may mean that as well as fake absentee votes, you actual votes were cancelled.
1324782359057584128 2020-11-07 02:35:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @P8R1OT Any and every dictatorship without the people's consent must inevitable resort to force when challenged.  They haven't assumed power or been voted the winner by the Electoral College and already the treats begin.  Of course if he loses Trump will leave, but he is far from that.
1324754431263453186 2020-11-07 00:44:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ArmyBratt68 @StarvinLarry Also need verification of the validity of the ballots.
1324752582787526657 2020-11-07 00:36:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TammyEveryday @DrShayPhD So our military is overseas away from home and family risking their lives for us and the Democrats deposit their votes in the garbage.  They have violated the citizenship of our brave soldiers.  This cannot stand!!!
1324751616814186496 2020-11-07 00:32:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Interesting.  My ballot said accepted a few days ago.  I just checked it again and it was still accepted.  Good as far as that goes, but what hit me is that I do not trust the election process and the people running it for shit  As far as I am concerned, there is no trust period!
1324745964339429377 2020-11-07 00:10:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @toddstarnes @Headline_ws That and a lot lot more.  For exampl:  It is about the over a million people in the energy industry and those that support it that will lose their jobs because their state(s) cheated them out of a fair election..
1324744671189327879 2020-11-07 00:05:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marklevinshow @QuintonWard10 Who the fuck is the decision desk anyway and who gave it the authority to call anything?
1324744468801626113 2020-11-07 00:04:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Beard_Vet @BMcCodeOvets125 Keep your powder dry.  I don't know who these Decision Desk people are but their calling anything is a matter of supernatual indifference to me.  Trump will win AZ, GA is going for recount, Nevada is coming up with thousands of votes by the dead, PA broke the law .....  Let's see
1324742245698818049 2020-11-06 23:55:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AndrewCMcCarthy Cheating is not stopping the count and then eliminating a 700,000 lead in the middle of the night.  That is a coup and an overt extreme act of treason.  So stop the shit.
1324727370486439936 2020-11-06 22:56:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SototG If true, you don't need a watermark.  A forensic analysis of the paper and ink and dust and other particles on the ballots should determine the country of origin.  A match of number of ballots printed in America to those mailed out would also be a good indicator.
1324715085592363009 2020-11-06 22:07:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KelemenCari @MariaSMBII Wait until they rip down the wall and give every illegal that can make it over the border citizenship.  Your American citizenshp will be worthless, you might as well be in Cuba or Venezuela?
1324712947520737281 2020-11-06 21:59:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GenFlynn @sioxielegend @FogCityMidge @tracybeanz @SidneyPowell1 @molmccann @RudyGiuliani @PamBondi @KerriKupecDOJ Interesting, everyone knew what was coming and the Democrats did it anyway.  Were they being set up?  Will the hammer come down on them?  Or will they get away with the destruction of our country?  We will see.
1324705838414532609 2020-11-06 21:30:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realMikeLindell @YouTube Two things hit me.  First, @realMikeLindell is no outside schlub.  He is close to Trump and an "insider".  Second, Trump and his people knew this was going to happen for a long time &amp; likely had intelligence.  I can't believe he sat back and did not implement counter measures.
1324700226045685760 2020-11-06 21:08:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sarahsmithF1 @GiannoCaldwell Within a year of a Biden win the wall will be down and every illegal will be a citizen.  The country will be lost.
1324699939591524352 2020-11-06 21:07:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DFBHarvard I am leaving in any case when everything comes to an end.
1324699799484989440 2020-11-06 21:06:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EvanAKilgore Every time Biden takes the lead, it is overnight.
1324683563195801600 2020-11-06 20:02:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @greta Bull Shit!  The Democrats will use force and every criminal means possibile to push their aganda and support their criminal activates and not give a rats tail about governing.  They will force compliance, not govern.
1324683082432094208 2020-11-06 20:00:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal @newsmax @FoxNews I am totally done with @FoxNews.  If their advertisers want to reach me they can look for me on @OANN and @Newsmax.  Sorry, because there are some good people still left on Fox, but I cannot support the lie.
1324676612378431488 2020-11-06 19:34:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DFBHarvard Biden will not win the Presidency.  If he assumes office it will be the result of Election Fraud as opposed to an Election Win.
1324676217920917509 2020-11-06 19:33:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> If the Democrats prevail, America will end up with illegitimate government that more than half the people do not support that will have to use force to enforce it's edicts.  Not my America.
1324526866552664064 2020-11-06 09:39:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SueMc473 @HowleyReporter Ten years for election fraud.  Ten years each.  This is beyond the pale.
1324526094809116672 2020-11-06 09:36:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EvanAKilgore Yes, there is no doubt.
1324518156086374403 2020-11-06 09:05:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @giffstein @FloridaDude297 Block the jerk.
1324507400787800065 2020-11-06 08:22:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RedWingGrips On the other hand, when this is over either way I am dropping twitter.
1324489891124666368 2020-11-06 07:12:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Pismo_B @tracybeanz How many will accept a government based on this?  Any question why the Democrats will not allow Republican observers?  This is disgusting.  That guy should get 10 years and every vote that has gone through his area voided.
1324488320638877700 2020-11-06 07:06:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods @Hoosiers1986 How does a nation survive if it's government is established through fraud and not accepted by more than half of the people?  Will Biden and the Democrats enforce their edicts through force?  If a people do not believe in the system, they will not comply with it's laws.
1324485828609859586 2020-11-06 06:56:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @may_talcott America deserves an honest election.  That is something the Democrats will not stand for.
1324471486929752064 2020-11-06 05:59:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tedcruz You sound surprised that the law means noting to Democrats.
1324456169730011136 2020-11-06 04:58:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dhiggins63 Obvious isn't it.  They are manifestly stupid.  They make up for it with "in your face" criminality backed by hate and arrogance.  I think that they have started something that will not end well for the country &amp; perhaps themselves.  They went to far &amp; out in the open this time.
1324455253366902784 2020-11-06 04:55:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lukeobxx Well the Democrats are all in.  They have committed election fraud for the country and world to see.  They cannot back down because to do so would end many of them in jail.  But Trump and his supporters will not accept the criminal acts.  So what will they do?
1324454644613959680 2020-11-06 04:52:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NickAdamsinUSA Which brings up the question.  If 1/2+ of America does not consider Biden to be President because he won through Democrat Election Fraud, how is he going to enforce his mandates?  People will not comply voluntarily.  Will Biden use force, the military / police, against Americans?
1324453577973067776 2020-11-06 04:48:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dhiggins63 Looks like they are going for 9 and 10.
1324432756714008576 2020-11-06 03:25:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dhiggins63 @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump So would be all of his followers.  Which leaves the Democrats with a government that half the country or more feels is criminal and invalid.  In a Democrat society people obey laws because they believe in the rule of law, in a Communist Country because they are made to by force.
1324423655242170371 2020-11-06 02:49:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec @Healing_USA @CLewandowski_ Apparently the State Supreme Court ruled that the votes can be counted in secret and we have to trust the result.
1324416482307006464 2020-11-06 02:21:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal Um, think they are covering for @FoxNews ?  This whole thing smells worse than Hunter after one of his sprees.
1324411761684959232 2020-11-06 02:02:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 LOL, I think you were accurate all along.  The only thing is that you did not show adjustments for Democrat Election Fraud.  Clearly Trump was elected by the people.  The question is, will the Democrats seize the government.?
1324391572658507776 2020-11-06 00:42:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump You bet, go get them.  Me, my family, and everyone I know is behind you.  And when elected, it is time to fix the election system so this never happens again.
1324365682293702656 2020-11-05 22:59:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> No matter how this turns out, the Democrats have destroyed the election process and no one in America will be able to believe that people are fairly and honestly elected.  You cannot trust your government.  That is the beginning of the end unless fixed now.
1324342259349819392 2020-11-05 21:26:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DemsH8Americans Clearly if the gov't is taken by fraud, the people have no representation.  The fraudsters (Democrats) are self appointed dictators.  Those in DC and State Houses should have no ability to tax, as well as enact laws, under the founding principles of our Republic.
1324318244128223232 2020-11-05 19:50:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TomFitton Election fraud.  That guy needs to be jailed.  There is no way America can accept a Biden "win".
1324146892884770816 2020-11-05 08:29:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HeyTammyBruce @KayaJones @TuckerCarlson I'll watch the video if someone posts it.  Phuck Fox.
1324146590165078016 2020-11-05 08:28:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> We have just taught our children that if you want something but are not able to obtain it legally, then steal, chear, and lie.
1324143508924497920 2020-11-05 08:16:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lukeobxx @scott_helmick Arizona as well.  My state would never vote for Biden.  It is a big time fix.
1324107108787183621 2020-11-05 05:51:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mahabrando Nope, but they can assume an honest decision.  People don't need to just assume that @CNN has either authority or credibility to make the call.
1324103162777661441 2020-11-05 05:36:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mahabrando That is a determination that will be made by the Supreme Court, not CNN.
1324091685853302785 2020-11-05 04:50:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DineshDSouza @scott_frenger Zero!
1324089409524826112 2020-11-05 04:41:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TrumpRulzz @maftf1956 Remember when the US was:  Truth, Justice, and  The American Way.  It appears that Democrat Election Fraud ended that.
1324087318181896192 2020-11-05 04:33:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Cindy123go @LibertyBell1000 @RepGosar Aren't the votes still valid even if the counting machine can't tabulate them?
1324086644949970944 2020-11-05 04:30:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @newtgingrich @DrShayPhD phuck twitter, the say will be in the courts.  Will the Democrat Election Fraud stand and end our country?
1324086319207780352 2020-11-05 04:29:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KayaJones @ScottyPatriot1 I will.
1324067577308487680 2020-11-05 03:14:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods Election Fraud!
1324052623939395584 2020-11-05 02:15:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Donadeedooda In English or in Tongue?
1324046555075108864 2020-11-05 01:51:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SebGorka @realDonaldTrump Yes.
1324044946303676416 2020-11-05 01:44:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @duckdiver19 So the Democrats did an oopsie.  A recount and audit of votes nationwide is indicated.  Apparently the same thing happened early on in Virginia.
1324043846141927426 2020-11-05 01:40:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FKUJAK1 @NightWatchNorm It didn't flip blue.  Let's see the final vote count and then the court challenges to Democrat Election Fraud.  Let's see how many have had their vote not counted because the election worker gave them a sharpie.  But you are right about McCain and Flake.
1324042646994604032 2020-11-05 01:35:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tasteofaz @Ajax2847 How low can you be, trashing the votes of the military who is on distant lands risking all for us.  Democrat low.
1324005966153699329 2020-11-04 23:09:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Mommie_03 @PolyPatriot This is going to be interesting when it hits the courts.
1323992781337948160 2020-11-04 22:17:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> And besided the Democrat Criminal Class, do you know who benefits the most from the overt Election Fraud?  China.  It will shortly own us.
1323992369587318784 2020-11-04 22:15:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> ....how much tax you pay.  The will be enacting and enforcing the laws whick rule your life.  All without your consent because you were cheated out of representation.  Your voice was stilled.  First rule of business will be them coming for your guns.
1323992368903675904 2020-11-04 22:15:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> If the Democrats win because of election fraud, the people of the United States are not represented in government.  We have transformed from a Representative Constitutional Republic to a tin pot leftist dictatorship.  The people who do not represent you will be deciding....
1323990310096039938 2020-11-04 22:07:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @amlivemon @niteowlmom3 There is no way Biden won AZ and there are hundreds of thousands of votes out.  I think this would be a good place to look at Democrat election fraud.
1323989183136870400 2020-11-04 22:03:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Yoder_Esqq This is one of the clearest examples of election fraud that you will ever see.
1323973112166182913 2020-11-04 20:59:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealEricCarmen @McDonal67511972 Check your ballot.
1323957720647544832 2020-11-04 19:58:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jeromegravesbm1 @honorablemdwife There is no way Biden won Arizona.
1323957501486723073 2020-11-04 19:57:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mpukita Yup, our country, freedom, and money is being stolen from us through Election Fraud.  Not sure how to react but will not accept a Democrat cheat win.
1323797010114248704 2020-11-04 09:19:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @roxyloveslucy Congratulations.
1323793447468232705 2020-11-04 09:05:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @trisagoras @williamlharbuck Yes, we are getting a lot of predictions based on D to R ratios and none of them have figured out that a lot of Ds are going for Trump.  Similarly the Is are not in the equation but I believe the independents are overwhelmingly Republican.
1323769764389416961 2020-11-04 07:31:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BernardKerik @stbythec @realDonaldTrump You bet.  I am in Arizona where we have @CaptMarkKelly lying to us about taking our guns, he will.  Vote red, all red.
1323769553738870784 2020-11-04 07:30:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DineshDSouza Vote, vote, vote, vote.  We all need each other.
1323769370393260032 2020-11-04 07:29:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Maximus_4EVR @Godwins1234 Remember, many of the Ds are voting for Trump.
1323768981107306497 2020-11-04 07:28:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sayitnspinit @realDonaldTrump Also vote out every FL House member.  We need to show Nancy where to put her gavel.
1323768798004961280 2020-11-04 07:27:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MarciaW02564145 Keep the faith, we are fighting for our and our children's future.  We are fighting evil.
1323768005914882048 2020-11-04 07:24:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> It is so sad that people are nervous that the election may hinge on how much ELECTION FRAUD that the DEMOCRATS can get away with.  This has to be fixed over the next four years.  We need honest elections.
1323767463943708672 2020-11-04 07:22:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JohnBasham @realmagapup Guy is a crook, vote him out.
1323763153792987136 2020-11-04 07:05:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CHIZMAGA @GCWINC2014 Go Arizona.  I voted Trump, McSally, and Biggs and everyone red on the ballot.  I even checked out the judges.  My family and friends did the same.  If you have not yet, please vote and vote for Trump and all red.  Let's save our country and our state.  Thanks all.
1323761747107344385 2020-11-04 06:59:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @The_SCB @YouTube The guy has no marbles left.

1323760941452849154 2020-11-04 06:56:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PollackHunter @penkalski_amy It is so important that you stay and vote.  Remember there are states that will award their Electors based on total popular vote across the country and not what is happening in their state.
1323759993632423936 2020-11-04 06:52:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @chuckwoolery @VLovesAnimals No.  Didn't the PA AG say that the votes were counted and Biden won yesterday before the voting began?  The only rational for the motion is that Barrett cannot be trusted to provide an honest hearing for the case.  No.
1323759065294516224 2020-11-04 06:48:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal @PageSix LOL, wouldn't that be grand.  They can all move to China.  It would be a perfect fit.  They are commies and their movies are being sold in China, so they would be home in a way.
1323758528339738626 2020-11-04 06:46:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal The Hollywood crew could make a killing if they made their departure a pay for view event.
1323758286580056065 2020-11-04 06:45:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @keithellison Did you check the trunk of @IlhanMN car?  I understand that there are a shit load of votes in it  @keithellison , I feel obligated to tell you that your Antifa / BLM thug base really does not have friends, just partners in looting, burning &amp; attacking the helpless.  Folks? 🤣🤣🤣
1323757017224290304 2020-11-04 06:40:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @nypost No comment would fit this.
1323746016772812801 2020-11-04 05:56:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @IM4IM2 I remember.  I was a Trump backer from day one, but thought he had no chance against the Democrat fraud machine.  I watched in elated shock as the dial started to flip away from Hillary and then kept going.
1323745408628088832 2020-11-04 05:54:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LionTedPride That's illegal  To bad that PA has a corrupt AG who is trying to keep his job through election fraud or the state would be doing something about it.  This is enough reason right here to vote out every Democrat running.  Let's get back to honest elections, not the leftist con jobs
1323744762432647168 2020-11-04 05:52:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.  Oh wonders of wonders if Nevada goes red.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
1323736175253708800 2020-11-04 05:17:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AquinasButler @egatz4u2 I think that they should be given a short time to run.
1323735687544205312 2020-11-04 05:15:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @IM4IM2 Oh wow.  That would be wonderful.

1323734167402680321 2020-11-04 05:09:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HillaryClinton Wait a moment!  Why is Hillary quoting the scriptures to the party of atheists?
1323733838854459392 2020-11-04 05:08:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HillaryClinton You must really be in tight with Satan to quote to bible with your dark lost atrophied thing that once was your soul.  Scripture tells us don't abuse little children.

1323708802089193472 2020-11-04 03:29:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec @HapaGirl2 What is the criminal AG up to now?

This is disgusting.  Everyone needs to get out and vote against this and overcome the criminal Democrats.
1323707317091643392 2020-11-04 03:23:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Fritzz_77 @CathyGemkow @MichaelCoudrey @SeanParnellUSA @realDonaldTrump Nobody is going to see a sign while walking into a voting station and change their votes unless they were not sure how criminal and scummy the Democrats are and this puts them over the top.

1323704851302215680 2020-11-04 03:13:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JoshShapiroPA You are the AG of PA and a Democrat involved in election fraud.  How low can you go.  I hope that there is a massive wave sweeping you out of office.  We do not need crooks dispensing the law.  If you are in PA, please vote this guy out.
1323703894166302720 2020-11-04 03:09:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @elenochle @realDonaldTrump This is huge.  It means that the Trump votes will be at least 1/3 more in 2020 than in 2016.  Wow.
1323701251385643008 2020-11-04 02:59:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @me_think_free @KevinJWatt1 Hope that is true.  Lots of room in jails for Democrat fraudsters.

1323695821334872064 2020-11-04 02:37:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RichardGrenell @JoshShapiroPA How much law will PA get from a Democrat AG who is involved in Election Fraud?
1323695310187556865 2020-11-04 02:35:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LarrySchweikart Remember, vote out every Democrat in every race.  One Democrat in office is one to many and will end up phucking up one defenseless American.  Let's take the House and tell Nancy where to insert her gavel.
1323694664554180608 2020-11-04 02:32:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dbongino Definitely do not believe anything the MSM tells you.  They lie and are in the bag for the leftists.  Stay in line and vote.
1323693952361328640 2020-11-04 02:30:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GuyChicago5151 Good stuff.
1323678684520226823 2020-11-04 01:29:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec @missjo1964 @JoshShapiroPA Only in a Democrag shit hole will the states AG actually participate in election fraud.  He is on the ballot.    Can you really expect @JoshShapiroPA to fairly enforce the law?
1323667900964564992 2020-11-04 00:46:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Cuds_1246 @PhillyGOP @BreitbartNews These are the people whose country the Democrats are trying to steal.  It cannot be allowed to happen.  https://t.co/0SIHC0YQVZ
1323665483728527361 2020-11-04 00:36:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FOX9 @MAGAChronicle Might as well vote Trump, they are going to burn down Minneapolis in any case.  At least with Trump there is a chance that law will be brought in and the city can be rebuilt.  Quiz - Which one is the Antifa thug that will take part in the riots posing with @CaptMarkKelly of AZ?  https://t.co/KdnAEOjRIw
1323664369012502528 2020-11-04 00:32:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DairyQu13037415 @bbusa617 She needs to be charged with election interference.
1323664066322157569 2020-11-04 00:31:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dhiggins63 @TheDemocrats I believe that the AG is up for reelection.  This is a good chance to get rid of him.
1323658703434776576 2020-11-04 00:10:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods Unacceptable.  In your face election fraud by Democrats.
1323658053137264640 2020-11-04 00:07:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @13thethe @robdetf Death to America and don't forget to vote Democrat.  Has a true ring does it not?
1323657771393298434 2020-11-04 00:06:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @intheMatrixxx @NewportLost Democrats are in your face election fraud.  In the end, will the American people accept this.  This is the exact reason why every Democrat needs be voted out of office.  They are corrupt cheats.
1323656799975735296 2020-11-04 00:02:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @willchamberlain The election is not Trump vs. Biden, it is Trump vs. Democrat election fraud.
1323655904810553344 2020-11-03 23:58:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Dagny_Galt Philly has taken out the stops on election fraud.
1323655699059023872 2020-11-03 23:58:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DeanBrowningPA I don't think Biden cares about that.  His entire purpose is to keep himself &amp; his family out of jail.  Apparently there is enough evidence to put them all in the slammer many times over so being elected is the only thing that can save him.  So Harris can have it if he goes free.
1323652053697064961 2020-11-03 23:43:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @pghowie3 In your face criminal Democrats.  They don't care about the law.
1323645605948715009 2020-11-03 23:17:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TracyYancey @bitsy423 @PhillyGOP Philly is a Democrat cesspool perpetuated by out and out thuggery and election fraud.
1323643389951143936 2020-11-03 23:09:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SecChi71 @Virginia_Girl57 Call the police.
1323641850700312576 2020-11-03 23:03:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 Make sure you vote.  Every one counts.  And while you are voting for Trump, vote all red.  No more of the Pelosi crap screwing around with out well being.
1323614994496319488 2020-11-03 21:16:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NotPCplayer Remember who has endorsed and embraced them.  We all know that @CaptMarkKelly is lying about taking our guns, he will go after them if elected.  But he is also lying about representing us and fighting the "corrupt" politians if he is elected.  He will be on the team to end us.  https://t.co/ONlTkGHVzu
1323613575454208000 2020-11-03 21:10:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @reubing @OANN for me.  I am pretty much done with @FoxNews which is said because although the network is being flushed, there are still some very good people there.
1323610302261288962 2020-11-03 20:57:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JohnWDean That he has let the Democrat governers and mayors handle the Antifa / BLM thugs in their states and cities.  Note, the "boarding up" is being done in NYC, LA, Portland, etc., etc., etc.  It says that we must not have one Democrat in office.
1323591128474529795 2020-11-03 19:41:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 @DemsH8Americans Indeed, I have a good idea where Nancy's gavel should be put.
1323590937214296065 2020-11-03 19:40:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @weimrnr As far of alcohol, don't forget the cardboard boxes of wine with plastic inserts that liberals love.
1323590577577881600 2020-11-03 19:39:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @may_talcott No, they will send out the Antifa thugs.  Apparently they now have the plan that when Biden loses, they can phuck things up so much, Pelosi can declare the winner of the election.
1323589885735833600 2020-11-03 19:36:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> A Biden win &amp; leftist destruction of the energy industry will be a huge hidden tax because you will pay more for everything.  Massive job losses will cause people to be trapped in poverty.  Energy sector jobs create non sector jobs as well.  Indeed Biden will bring darkness.
1323589884825669633 2020-11-03 19:36:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> $ 4 is cheap if Biden is elected.  And it is not only gas that you will pay more for.  All products are moved around the country before they reach you, some even are delivered to your door.  Their prices will skyrocket.  How many products are petrolium based?  Heating &amp; cooling!
1323584816462229504 2020-11-03 19:16:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @debbieratto79 @Bridget19331935 @JoshShapiroPA Wow, he has the Rod the Weasel Rosenstein look down pat.  The Democrats have indeed embraced "in your face election fraud" and "what are you going to do about it?"  No Democrat / Marxist / Corrupt / Criminal should hold office.

1323394985165664256 2020-11-03 06:42:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DrShayPhD Back at you.
1323389330425962496 2020-11-03 06:19:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @markknoller You do know Biden has a number of tax liens against him?  That doesn't count foreign money laundered through Hunter squirrelled away in hidden overseas accounts that never made his tax forms.  How come you don't ask Joe about that?  PS - Trump's returns were leaked.  Stop BSing.

1323370171394748416 2020-11-03 05:03:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LLinWood The Democrats have criminalized self defense.

Here is Gabby hugging the Antifa thug who helped loot and burn Minneapolis.  ALL RED.  https://t.co/N0uQn7fUzS

The idea of @CaptMarkKelly in the Senate working to take away our guns (which he is lying about), making deals for his Chinese business associates, bilking more for his company than the $ 15M he already got from us in AZ, ...  https://t.co/qCiEVhp7SD
1323364052723097600 2020-11-03 04:39:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @123RHGreen @JackySinAZ @gatewaypundit Every one of us has to get out and vote and contribute to saving the country for ourselves and future generations.  And remember all of the Democrats are dirty, vote red all the way down the line.  Check out the judges to, we have tol much garbage on the bench.
1323363540657471489 2020-11-03 04:37:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SaraCarterDC First that is a lie.  Second, anything he gives you will be taken from others, innocent others.  Do you want to hurt people who have never done anything for Biden's alms.
1323363054558474241 2020-11-03 04:35:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kimKBaltimore The best of luck to you.  The people of Baltimore have been kept in a very bad place for a lot of year by the Democrats so that a few could prosper.  I hope you can get it this time around, but you have begun what will be a great career.  Go get em'.
1323334135411191808 2020-11-03 02:40:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dawg_lb @DJNazSD The Communists have taken over the Democrat Party.  No matter what you think you are voting for, if you vote Democrat you are voting to install a leftist dictatorship and to turn America into Venezuela.
1323333658619469825 2020-11-03 02:38:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Breaking911 @ShaneGoldmacher By who and how is O'Malley speaking for them.  When Trump gets up and says, I've won it is over.  No one needs Biden or one of his stooge's permission.
1323332729610465281 2020-11-03 02:34:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @purplemeatballs MI is great.  Feel sorry for the state with its dictator governor.

1323331300850233344 2020-11-03 02:29:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrAndyNgo The police could have at least let them take their Halloween costumes and make up off before the mug shots.
1323330677190746112 2020-11-03 02:26:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @rosesnbloom1 No and I am a bacon freak.
1323330467207155713 2020-11-03 02:25:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump Doesn't Biden have liens on his properties for non payment of taxes.  And those are the ones that the Fed knows about and not money stashed out of country.
1323329928872390656 2020-11-03 02:23:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 @gatewaypundit WTF is going on.  We all know that the Democrats are going to cheat, election fraud central, but to slap us in the face with it is to much.  Who is this criminal AG of Pennsylvania?
1323329553285046273 2020-11-03 02:22:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Patrick02236004 Would you trust (by March) your future and your childrens future with:  President Harris Vice President Pelosi Cabinet members Sanders, Waters, AOC, Warren, etc. ?  The thought is frightening and portends the end of America.
1323319447285719040 2020-11-03 01:41:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mharakal @erinschmitt66 @JoshShapiroPA @jack @Twitter He is out trimming his beard, you need to appeal to someone else.
1323318778743017473 2020-11-03 01:39:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GOP @LindaSuhler @realDonaldTrump Remember it is not just the people in energy, it is everyone in the state because the revenue &amp; business spreads across all professions and services.  More barbers, car sales, home sales, appliances, tires, lawn care, &amp; on and on and on.  We are all in the boat.  NO $10 GAL GAS!!
1323317000605560832 2020-11-03 01:32:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tgatorguy @jimsmith1944 Can you imagine, in March, Harris is president, Pelosi is vp, and Bernie, Warren, AOC, and Waters are cabinet members.  It would be the end of our country and any chance at life for our children.  Vote like everything counts on it, because it does.
1323307899834134528 2020-11-03 00:56:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @1776Stonewall The @FBI is on it. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1323302950798721025 2020-11-03 00:36:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto Anyone in Michigan who votes blue at any level, for any office is a moron.  The state is taking names and building a data base and you and YOUR CHILDREN will be in it.  Scary stuff.  Democrats in MI have made your lives so much worse.
1323301238964809729 2020-11-03 00:29:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Shem_Infinite @Anzers No might about it.

1323272100501614592 2020-11-02 22:33:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @YossiGestetner @jonathanvswan But, but, but, America already has Obama who is our self declared shadow president.  Maybe Biden can be the shadow vice president.
1323271311926308864 2020-11-02 22:30:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @atensnut Not possible unrest.  Tomorrow will be national looting, raping, and pilliageing day as promoted by the Democrats, Antifa, BLM, MSM, big tech, and the Communists across the nation.
1323270678070525952 2020-11-02 22:28:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @brhodes Yeah, Hillary would be President on a wave of fraudulent votes.  Nah.

1323247168786894849 2020-11-02 20:54:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Kendo_Lees If you loot Wendy's in MI, is the resturant still required to take your contact information under pain of fine and prison?
1323246772949454849 2020-11-02 20:53:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GKeile @jonesca100 Wow, incredible.  It is easy to see why this would offend the America hating Communists at @Facebook.  Give a listen.
1323244290185719809 2020-11-02 20:43:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TheBabylonBee So in Detroit, if you take your kids out for a big Mac, you have to give the state their private contact and address information.  Sorry that sounds way scary.
1323243466793512960 2020-11-02 20:40:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TheBabylonBee This is irony,......................NOW.  A Biden victory may make it reality.
1323242215284469763 2020-11-02 20:35:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CCM1956 @RoseDC11 MI needs vote Trump or the state can end up as a Communist dictatorship with no outside authority to help the people.
1323238534703009792 2020-11-02 20:20:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CG29234967 @YpsiGal @ddale8 The fact that Democrats main election operation is election fraud and America is entitled to a honest election.  Counting votes in the dark and hiding the ballots won't cut it.

1323044740984524800 2020-11-02 07:30:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto Rod the Weasel Rosenstein who appointed Muller, gave him his charter and assignment, and monitored him as his supervisor has stated that he knew nothing.  This is how the @FBI / @TheJusticeDept works.  That is how Democrats get away with crimes spanning pedophillia to treason.
1323037244962164736 2020-11-02 07:00:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Ann_marie1231 @PRAETORIANOF76 Why does the Harris body double have security or are they security doubles?
1323036891554349056 2020-11-02 06:59:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Ann_marie1231 @PRAETORIANOF76 So the Democrat morons who took selfies are going to treasure the picture with a fake Harris.
1323036614025637891 2020-11-02 06:58:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 Vote Trump for the win.  Much of the analysis I am seeing is looking at Democrat vs. Republican turnout / voters and are silent about the independents who I believe are going to go big for Trump.  I also believe that many registered Dems are going to go Trump.
1323036044124594176 2020-11-02 06:55:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @liquidlaugh @quippingalong Right before they went into hiding the Delaware police passed the photos on to the @FBI who have side lined them to investigate the great Texas Biden bus escort.  Democrat pervs and pedos who abuse little girls are clearly under @FBI protection.
1323035253556961280 2020-11-02 06:52:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ThatConservativ So if screaming trust fund girl and her friends burns down and trashes much of NYC, what is the downside?  Asking for a friend who is coming up blank.
1323034192871976960 2020-11-02 06:48:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joseph7gonzales @RealJamesWoods They do if they are in Florida but think that they are in Minnesota.  All kidding aside, may be fake or may not be fake, but with Biden there is not much difference.
1323033489353011201 2020-11-02 06:45:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods @BobSpiritwalker At this point with charges of photoshopping and the usual 🐂💩 that Democrats spew, I am on the same page as Biden.  I don't know what state he is in either.
1323033080924266496 2020-11-02 06:44:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Right_NotLeft @Teacher255 Vote.  All red, one Democrat is one to many.
1323032440126939137 2020-11-02 06:41:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec @dkrwilliams @FBI PS - If those Texas people wanted to run the Biden bus off the road, they would be hauling it out of a ditch as I type.  They are not pussy Antifa types.
1323031817255964672 2020-11-02 06:39:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec @dkrwilliams There was a report that a garage pull was spotted on a seat in one of the Trump supporter's car.  The @FBI threw Hunter's laptop back into the bin so as to mobilize maximum forces to investigate.  The @FBI has become a thug organization dressed in clown shoes.  What a joke.
1323030588773683201 2020-11-02 06:34:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cabinetdoorgirl Yeah, @foxnews decided to give us another day to not watch anything with Juan Williams on it.
1323018470372438016 2020-11-02 05:45:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marklevinshow @jumagoe The @FBI is taking one last shot before they are gutted of the corruption and dirt starting on 11/04.  Wray is working hard for his laundered payoff that will come after he is fired.
1323018094931931136 2020-11-02 05:44:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Kintu3 @Bloggasaurus @gatewaypundit Get out and vote, take nothing for granted.  The Democrats will pull every dirty illegal election fraud scam that is known to man.    Also, vote all red.  Remember Pelosi if in control of the House will try to stop all of the good that Trump will do.
1323016996628262912 2020-11-02 05:40:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto She will sit by her study window in her Beverly Hills mansion and glare at them as they work to maintain her property.
1323005744304721920 2020-11-02 04:55:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SittinPrettyJo @TomFitton :-)
1323005279697424386 2020-11-02 04:53:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @pnjaban @RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump Any Democrat in office is one Democrat to many.
1323005065565675520 2020-11-02 04:52:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SittinPrettyJo @TomFitton I don't think that Sullivan cares.  His payoff will be laundered to him when he retires which he will do when the walls start closing in on him.  Until then, he will do as much harm to the country as he can get away with.
1323004267305734144 2020-11-02 04:49:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> It is all tied together, the lies, the coming for our guns, the violence against people and the grab for power.  We cannot have @CaptMarkKelly in the Senate working hand in hand with @IlhanMN in the House to bring to all of America what we are seeing in Democrat run NYC.
1323004265682493442 2020-11-02 04:49:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Interesting what is going on in NYC right now.   https://t.co/2zmBfZUzD2  Also interesting is that Gabby is embracing an Antifa thug who participated in the burning &amp; looting of Minneapolis.  Hubby @CaptMarkKelly has endorsed the most Anti American, Anti-Semitic person in politics  https://t.co/X5bpcn1xs0
1323002635054538752 2020-11-02 04:43:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrAndyNgo @livesmattershow This idea (Biden) that does not exist (Nadler) is attacking the police in NYC.
1323002057373208584 2020-11-02 04:40:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrAndyNgo @livesmattershow After yelling and screaming at the police, she returned to daddy's condo in Manhattan and sent out for dinner.
1322996535366348800 2020-11-02 04:18:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TomFitton @SittinPrettyJo WTF is going on in DC?
1322995914781335553 2020-11-02 04:16:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ForkedSparky @reubing @SpeakerRyan @FoxNews I will watch on @OANN to get honest coverage.
1322995586472108032 2020-11-02 04:15:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bbbraner @reubing There are a few more like Dobbs and Ingram but indeed, Ryan &amp; "the sons" have turned @FoxNews into a garbage heap.

1322994901068378112 2020-11-02 04:12:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Pismo_B @dougspeck69 @NYCMayor Never forget, NEVER AGAIN.
1322994176900780032 2020-11-02 04:09:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 @elianselmi Two points.  1 - Some are saying that is photoshopped &amp; Biden was really in Minn.  Don't know, but for a guy that has proven many times he does not know where he is,, this is believable.  It could be the wrong sign.  2 - Old Democrat trick, everyone will believe before disproven.
1322992918152441856 2020-11-02 04:04:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods @Tia6sc Remember when they attack no mercy because they are evil and will show you none.
1322992405071626240 2020-11-02 04:02:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realBradBrewer @KamalaHarris LOL, phucking over their own supporters with a fake.  Isn't that so Democrat.
1322965022960623616 2020-11-02 02:13:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @stuff_charlie @ConservVoice The real people that should worry are the youngsters.  They will have a long life in a dark and hateful country if Biden wins.   Think of the lives of the people in Cuba, Venezuela, China, Russia, other Marxist dictatorships.
1322964458193313792 2020-11-02 02:11:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dcexaminer Nothing like Billions in Chinese money to American Universities to sharpen their perspective.
1322964071382097920 2020-11-02 02:09:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Navy_Lady_45 @tazmac55 @realDonaldTrump Wow, never forget Antifa swarms like enraged rodents.
1322963915815313408 2020-11-02 02:09:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KMCRadio @Solmemes1 @realDonaldTrump Indeed.  I am so tired of Nancy that I could scream.
1322962649357852678 2020-11-02 02:04:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JenniferJingo @MJKHogs Now they are saying that the video was shopped and he was really in MN.    I will go with my original statement that the guy is a turnip and leave his actual whereabouts in the unknown column.
1322960611127390208 2020-11-02 01:56:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JenniferJingo @MJKHogs The guy is a trunip.  Besides being corrupt, a criminal, and traitor to America as well as a perv and peodo, the guy has mush between his ears.  What I can't comprehend is that there are people voting for him and see him as their president deciding their fate.
1322960021349519360 2020-11-02 01:53:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JenniferJingo @MJKHogs It was a shock to everyone in FL to find out that their state had been renamed Minnesota.
1322959570235355136 2020-11-02 01:51:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @nytopinion @Kentgreenfield1 So what is the Supreme Court for?
1322958911809363968 2020-11-02 01:49:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Your tweet to me never reached me.  So sad, I think @twitter is playing games with us.   https://t.co/VSrL3Wuixn  I found it on your timeline.  💏
1322957981202329600 2020-11-02 01:45:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal 😂
1322949519428915200 2020-11-02 01:11:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SandyForLiberty 👍
1322910576893255683 2020-11-01 22:37:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KimDillow6610 Perhaps none.  But it was headlineg with a big spread in the @DailyMailUK , @DailyMail which has a HUGE readership.  I have not looked at the Post, but they likely will have it.  It is all over twitter tweeted by individuals.  The MSM can't hide the news, just drive people away.
1322883467839877120 2020-11-01 20:49:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @starknightz Are you saying that the Democrats at the Trump rallies are chanting "We love you"?  It seems that the party of registration may not be an indicator of vote total.
1322882803873165312 2020-11-01 20:46:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WilliamMillen5 Sounds like Trump supporters need to keep their guns loaded and near.
1322882171460149249 2020-11-01 20:44:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JimKuther @WhiteHouse Truth.  But on the other hand, young Americans will have a long ugly lifetime paying for a Democarat Socialist Agenda.
1322881660216438784 2020-11-01 20:42:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WayneDupreeShow @nancylee2016 No one in that crowd was contacted in the recent #FakePolls done by #FakeNews that show Biden ahead.
1322879706325086208 2020-11-01 20:34:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HarleyDF @toddstarnes Biden won't remember his statements and his future activity will likely be playing with his navel.
1322878984250519557 2020-11-01 20:31:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HeshmatAlavi This will be America and worse with a Biden win and Democrat takeover.  Do you want to live like this?  If you do, you can always move to Iran or Venezuela or Cuba.
1322873595115102208 2020-11-01 20:10:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TomFitton @teamcombover16 @realDonaldTrump On 11/04 .

1322863285385846784 2020-11-01 19:29:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrAndyNgo When Democrats are elected, civilization ends
1322862291457470464 2020-11-01 19:25:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Thomas1774Paine That would be deplorable.
1322718120159571973 2020-11-01 09:52:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @scott_helmick How many are representing NY and CA?
1322717962562756608 2020-11-01 09:51:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Donadeedooda @dbongino Either that or sending out to China for more pre completed ballots.
1322717182652903424 2020-11-01 09:48:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto I wonder how many copies the Chinese have.  Elect Joe and learn to speak Chinese.
1322716985235398656 2020-11-01 09:47:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Midwood49 Funny how NYC with its stringent tough gun laws has tons and tons of armed security guards running around.  I guess that gun laws in leftist cities only apply to those who need to protect themselves.
1322702183448539136 2020-11-01 08:49:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RedWingGrips @crocboy It is NY.
1322701236236296192 2020-11-01 08:45:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Pouissant1 @Emmita17E Muh state.  :-)  Muh President.  Don't forget to vote for McSally.  Not only will she continue to be great (for us) in DC, but it will keep @CaptMarkKelly away from our guns and away from dictating how we live our lives.  https://t.co/YDEKpuom0K
1322698736133312512 2020-11-01 08:35:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kincaid323 @MarthaMcSally @TheDemocrats 2/2  Everyone wants common sense laws.  What Democrats consider common sense is not all that common or sensible.  @CaptMarkKelly would use that term when taking our guns which he is lying about.  Lie, lie, 🐂💩, lie.  I am tied of you (leftist liars) guys  Now do his China stuff
1322697720813924352 2020-11-01 08:31:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kincaid323 @MarthaMcSally @TheDemocrats 1/2   Bull 💩, bull 💩, and bull 💩.  It is not uncommon for hypocrite Democrats to ban guns and have guns themselves and heavily armed security.  You guys lie.    #2A does not have to be undone, just make gun ownership impossible under restrictive rules.  Being done already  Lie
1322677001975554048 2020-11-01 07:09:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WhiteHouse @JoeFreedomLove And those jobs create more jobs in all sectors that provide services and products to those making a good wage in manufacturing.
1322676455071907840 2020-11-01 07:06:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kincaid323 @MarthaMcSally The only thing Kelly will fight for is to take our guns and to make what Schumer says happen.  https://t.co/fQzgsDWDLX
1322676195352174592 2020-11-01 07:05:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WestEschaton @MarthaMcSally Show me a Democrat who has not sold out the country and has not embraced evil.  https://t.co/WdR5uPrLbd
1322675580303626240 2020-11-01 07:03:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MarthaMcSally @JackySinAZ You left out:  He will take our guns.  He is lying to us. He bilked AZ out of $ 15,000,000 to create jobs, and when the check cleared fired people. He has considerable deep Chinese financial connections (another Biden?) He sucks on Schumer. He embraces Anti American haters.  https://t.co/1D2sdoWOCb
1322673980688326657 2020-11-01 06:57:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joebev49 People are voting for him.  Hard to believe.  They must all want Harris for president although they did not want her when she was going for the nomination.  Geeze.
1322673264288649216 2020-11-01 06:54:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KamVTV @ronmolina More speaking in tongues.  We all need a Satan to English dictionary to figure out what he is saying.
1322672983723307009 2020-11-01 06:53:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChanelRion @OANN Funny, Biden will up our taxes to the point of breaking us, but does not pay his own.  I wonder how much more he would owe if the IRS found out how much Chinese, Russian, Ukrainian, and other money he is stashing overseas.  Will the liens magically disappear if he wins?
1322634087828369408 2020-11-01 04:18:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AbeAntiFaHQ @ericcervini Wow, Antifa and ISIS buy their uniforms at the same place.
1322633311655657472 2020-11-01 04:15:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Thomas1774Paine Buzz Aldrin is an American who loves his country.  @CaptMarkKelly is a liar who will take our guns and give us over to China.  He also endorses and embraces hate.  https://t.co/5Io9OqeGTV
1322632067310518272 2020-11-01 04:10:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @starknightz Sue is good, but get the message out.  The Democrats have targeted all minority communites with lies and hate and a pittance from the gov't.  They are taking your soul for cheap.  God, Family, and self respect are the blocks of a good life and happiness.
1322631215111827456 2020-11-01 04:07:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ScottPresler Vote.
1322630151063044096 2020-11-01 04:02:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @YahooNews Researchers estimate that @YahooNews is full of 💩 97% of the time in it's desparated attempt to get the career criminal and American traitor Biden elected so Harris, who no one wants, can be president
1322623276477161473 2020-11-01 03:35:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Sal_palz @RNS_USA @KelemenCari Hahahaha  90 follower obvious bot calling me a bot.  These morons never end their stupidity, do they?  Oh well, blocky poo.
1322599808708698112 2020-11-01 02:02:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @YarnellSheila @Andromodid We all know that Biden will not last, for many reasons, more that a few months.  Do you really want Harris to be President?  If you are Democrat, do you really want Harris to be President?
1322599091055038464 2020-11-01 01:59:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump Yes.
1322599007001128961 2020-11-01 01:59:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WhiteHouse @PMgeezer @realDonaldTrump A Biden victory will destroy Pennsylvania.  Not only will the energy industry be decimated but so to will all businesses and people across the state that provide support, services, and general goods to the workers and companies in that industry.  State tax revenues will plummet.
1322569458817249282 2020-11-01 00:01:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump No.  The elites will throw the thugs under the bus.  Once the election is over, there will be nothing stopping direct action against Antifa / BLM and generic looters and the elites will not fund or support insurrection if they are at risk.  Look to Dem cities for a bit of rioting
1322552279241646082 2020-10-31 22:53:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @mba382 So I guess you did not send them a pallet full of cash.
1322552039537168386 2020-10-31 22:52:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MikayesFiona @tmacquoid What would sleepy Joe have done?  What would Obama have done?  What would Hillary have done?  The hostiage was way fortunate that he/she was taken during the Trump presidency.
1322551028458217473 2020-10-31 22:48:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RNS_USA @KelemenCari If the Trump supporters were Antifa / BLM, her people, the bus would have been stopped and she yanked off to great harm.  We know who is building and responsible for harms way, evil Democrats / Marxists / Anarcists.
1322549155219169284 2020-10-31 22:41:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 Two things unknown.  1 How many Independents have voted for Trump. 2 How many Democrats have voted for Trump.  The Republicans are Trump all the way.  I would bet the Democrats are Negitive bigly at this point.
1322548262717419523 2020-10-31 22:37:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @1776Stonewall So the Governor and Antifa AG of Minnesota made people stand in the cold to hear what was being said.  That only makes people hate them more and become more committed to fight their evil.  Use of the public trust to abuse the public for political gain is pretty low.
1322524326701137920 2020-10-31 21:02:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EricTrump @dihanshaw WTF?  Campaigning on raising taxes and the turnip brained leftist sheeple are going duh, yeah good stuff.
1322509678044041219 2020-10-31 20:04:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrAndyNgo Your neighborhood on Biden and the other Democrats.
1322371312099024896 2020-10-31 10:54:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @charliekirk11 That was obvious from the start.
1322310310783447040 2020-10-31 06:52:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @fantasticlegs Wow, CA is now a true Marxist dictatorship.  I think that this is likely illegal &amp; definitely fascist.  I am sure that riots by Antifa / BLM are excluded from the guidelines.  Have we come to the point that there is going to be shoot outs with the police if you try to eat turkey
1322308679824105472 2020-10-31 06:45:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TurningRedish @Jennyjen010 I agree with you on the polls.  My entire family would be in the independent column and not counted for Trump, but we have all voted Red up and down the line.  We even checked out the judges, enough of the leftists on the bench.  We would not talk to pollsters.
1322308169947734018 2020-10-31 06:43:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TurningRedish @Jennyjen010 I am a man &amp; independent but am a true from day one Trump supporter.  I embraced the Republicans not because they are anything to shake a stick at, but clearly the Democrats are pure evil (never thought like that before), corrupt, criminal, &amp; will make America into a living hell.
1322277611867791365 2020-10-31 04:42:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @youlivethrice @ggeett37aaa @TPInsidr Why do you think he is running?  So he can steal the election an pass the country on to Harris for pardons all around.  Democrats never pay, they beat the rap.

1322276614340702208 2020-10-31 04:38:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @qt_patri @KatieFLelite7 Bernie's people, now with Biden, want to build Gulags for reeducation purposes.
1322275072506093574 2020-10-31 04:31:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 @KatieFLelite7 @gatewaypundit Explain to me how you can have a rally and exclude the people you are trying to convince to vote for you.  Hey folks, Joe and Barry are going to have a no person rally.  🤣
1322274297189072896 2020-10-31 04:28:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MisterToxicMan Wait until after the election and payback begins.  I am pissed about being shadow banned and put in twitter jail like I was some misbehaving child.  I hope our reelected President and Majority in both Houses takes a good look at twitter and facebook and google for a start.
1322270309139902464 2020-10-31 04:13:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Qtah17 @ElizAKByrd Biden's election is the end of the United States and any hope for the quality of our and our children's lives.  If you are a Democrat look at Venezuela, Cuba, or China to name a few before you vote for Biden.  Because the shit he is promising you is all lies.
1322269160793989120 2020-10-31 04:08:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cabinetdoorgirl I'm on 20 and what a thrill to see the principal starting to shoot down fast.  Stay with it.

1322266561172811776 2020-10-31 03:58:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ConservVoice @smarkster Looks like they moved the residents of the local old age home to attend the rally.  Probably lied to them and promised sunshine and snacks.
1322266017066676225 2020-10-31 03:55:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @donnabrazile Biden does not have 💩.  Whoever (and we have a good idea) is trying to steal the election through election fraud has 4,000 lawyers (if you can believe the liar who did the original tweet).  4,000 lawyers with an average (lowball) billing rate of $ 200 an hr., is $ 800,000 an hr.
1322264992624730112 2020-10-31 03:51:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @smarkster @ConservVoice OK, wait a mo.  Where are the chalk circles?
1322264763624140800 2020-10-31 03:51:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @channelinggalt I guess that is one way of reducing the BLM numbers.
1322264047874576385 2020-10-31 03:48:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EricTrump @scott_helmick Election fraud, just a guess.
1322252123455680513 2020-10-31 03:00:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Cuds_1246 @jat1020 @gatewaypundit May backfire, it is BS and of course after 11/03 when the numbers are corrected it will be to late, but chicken shit Democrats are more likely to be scared into their basements than conservatives.
1322251162498686976 2020-10-31 02:56:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BarnettforAZ I don't care as long as they don't come here to Arizona and vote for skummy Democrats, you know like the people they ran from.
1322240783253032961 2020-10-31 02:15:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DepolableDuck @RobertHamza8 Biden now is speaking in tongues.  I bet a State of the Union address under him would be the event of the century.
1322239117342597120 2020-10-31 02:09:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KIMAGA4EVER @gailsline A biblical moment arrives when Biden begins speaking in tongues.  Anyone speak satan that can translate what he said?

You can't escape the garbage that Biden and @CaptMarkKelly are spewing into your living room if you want to watch a show.  Biden's latest is that he is a patriotic American.  After selling us out to China
1322236596138070017 2020-10-31 01:59:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lukeobxx Now ask the other 2 how likely is it that she will be president soon after Biden is elected?
1322235945966477312 2020-10-31 01:56:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DonaldJTrumpJr @GSaldana60 First time they mentioned corrupt Joe and his Hunter nub selling us out to China.

No surprise, I am a conservative &amp; @twitter does not like conservatives  Twitter should not have 230 protection.

Kelly endorsed &amp; has campaigned for the most Anti American, Anti Semitic, Anti Christian, America hater running for congress.  His wife is hugging @IlhanMN s Antifa daughter.  https://t.co/zE8ZVEtKiV

KELLY IS LYING TO US.  Kelly bilked Arizona taxpayers out of $ 15,000,000 to create jobs &amp; when the check cleared fired people.  Mark Kelly is a junior Biden with extensive China connections.  https://t.co/9gT1TKtg3Y

1322197484689522689 2020-10-30 23:23:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrAndyNgo The Democrat base.  Remember them when you ask who would vote for brain addled, treasonous, corrupt, sell out Biden.
1322146278046720000 2020-10-30 20:00:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Rasmussen_Poll @POTUS Way more than the pole shows.  Considering leftist Democrat attacks and threats and put downs ("...you ain't black.") , how many will admit that they are indeed voting for Trump.  I already voted Trump and would not indicate a voter preference if a pollster called me.
1322145314673815552 2020-10-30 19:56:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AriFleischer @Sgfreer55 Sorry, but I like Trump.  He is a kick.  I have never bought into the MSM leftist narrative that people don't like Trump.  Marxists, anarchists, criminals, politically corrupt, etc. hate him, but does that count.  My President.

1322143319636365315 2020-10-30 19:48:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Good morning Arizona  We all know that @CaptMarkKelly will take our guns if elected, that he is lying about that &amp; when elected it would be to late, the Democrats will tear down the border wall and allow unlimited illegals.  CAN YOU IMAGINE ARIZONA WITH NO WALL AND NO GUNS?

None of the 30 people at the rally will know where to stand.  This is bad.  If the teleprompter shorts out, Biden will just stand there in a fog.  Oh well, it is not like he has anything to say.
1321971655053172736 2020-10-30 08:26:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @liquidlaugh We can always go to the @nypost   web site for news updates.  Plus I have a Parler account.  Can't stand their interface but at least it is not run by leftist clowns who restrict free speech.  Plenty of information there.
1321970350549184512 2020-10-30 08:21:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 Indeed.  It feels like things can blow at any time.  The leftists are fanning the flames and announcing plans for violent take over of the country.
1321960075720753152 2020-10-30 07:40:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 It would be good to get rid of her.
1321959920086835202 2020-10-30 07:39:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Jim_Jordan I remember when I was young and had to work an extra job for a long time to get a washer for my wife and new baby.  Now I am going to pay for his through higher prices so the store can recover it's looting losses.
1321959258791976960 2020-10-30 07:37:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 Warner is a turnip that has been left out in the sun to long.  Good to get rid of that bastard.
1321959010291998720 2020-10-30 07:36:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 @gatewaypundit Like a bad repeating story.  The last two Democrat candidates have been under criminal investigation during the election.
1321957561084514304 2020-10-30 07:30:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 Close, it would be nice to get rid of that clown Booker.  He has done nothing for the country or the people of his state.  Just a waste of time and space in the Senate.
1321947584001236994 2020-10-30 06:50:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JamesRosenTV @TheJusticeDept @FBI @WeAreSinclair To anyone who voted early for Biden.  Would you take your vote back if you could?
1321945745558102016 2020-10-30 06:43:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Millie__Weaver Is hanging still the punishment for treason and attempting to overthrow the gov't.  Just asking for the 4th.
1321932063570685952 2020-10-30 05:48:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 @willbarrett_1 Because some of us don't pay taxes on our acquisitions and some of us do not care about the lockdowns and come out anyway.  https://t.co/Ai34AusEYB

1321926620349829121 2020-10-30 05:27:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PMgeezer So Philly is going to do a vote count in secret and then let us know the results.  No.
1321925482502266880 2020-10-30 05:22:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Thomas1774Paine I am biggly not a fan of Apple, but it would be sweet to see them put it to @google.  PS - I use @DuckDuckGo and have not touched google in a long time.  Google is a scummy anti-American, pro China company whose pencil necks have a God complex in my opinion.
1321924069323800576 2020-10-30 05:17:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @_BetsyRoss WTF  No matter what the count is Joe Biden will be elected president.  She has checked into the ding dong motel in a room next to Joe's.

1321907733310763008 2020-10-30 04:12:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Kavanaugh voted with the Democrats and Roberts (whatever the heck he is) in the last one so it was 5 - 3.  Barrett would not have made a difference.  Simple, she reclused because she did not have time to review the case.  The legitimacy of the ballots will likely be the real test
1321906962359939072 2020-10-30 04:09:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrMichaelBurkes It is clear to me that almost entirely all Trump 16 is Trump 20.  It is also clear that many Democrats have crossed over (God Bless Them).  What is not clear is how many.  So if I were the Dem elites I would not get to excited over ballot count by party Registration.
1321905863896883200 2020-10-30 04:04:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MomJar1 @JackySinAZ @realDonaldTrump Remember when business wanted your trade and good will.  Now the paradigm is to build a monopoly by hook and by crook and then when you have people captive you can phuck all over them and spew them with your contempt.  The minute there is a viable option many will be gone.
1321905028563521536 2020-10-30 04:01:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FishmanLevine Trump has been predicting mid 30s for a few weeks now.  So you might want to change that to, "better than SOME expected".
1321893275704328192 2020-10-30 03:14:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @13thGenPatriot @catturd2 Good on them.  I am in Arizona and my entire family voted Trump and all republican.  We even checked out the judges.  Great feeling isn't it?
1321892225077293056 2020-10-30 03:10:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AmericaFirstPAC @Destinbeach22 33.1% is a number never heard when describing the GDP increase.  It is more like the percentage of Joes cut on a Hunter payoff.
1321891902287880192 2020-10-30 03:09:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ielizabeth_ @e3f3c53fc7ae44e Truth, honesty, and coverage of actual events are against @twitters Terms of Service.  All attacks on conservatives, MSM lies, Iran propaganda, and the like are fine.  If it is an insult to Trump supporters, the more crude, the more vulger, the more disgusting the better.
1321890420167639040 2020-10-30 03:03:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MustangMan_TX @ConservVoice To name one.  https://t.co/mByx8jYufL
1321874864127451136 2020-10-30 02:01:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HighNotePatriot Will you be tweeting a hint?
1321874151980687360 2020-10-30 01:58:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealSaavedra So does @CaptMarkKelly who is running for the Senate in Arizona.  Seems like the #CCP owns many of the Democrats who are striving to take control of our country.  Biden is not the only one by any means.
1321872979723120641 2020-10-30 01:54:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TriFit25 Agree.

1321860726579851264 2020-10-30 01:05:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SoCalEdgyGal Nervous - Democrat Election Fraud.
1321840437125140482 2020-10-29 23:44:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Project_Veritas Guy needs to be jailed.
1321840134711472128 2020-10-29 23:43:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EricTrump @debaroo54 Sad day for Democrats, the country is coming back with a roar under Trump.
1321804813177290752 2020-10-29 21:23:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sioxielegend We may not always agree with Barrett but I believe that she will always follow what she believes the law to say and make an honest decision.  That is what conservatives want, not a bunch of hacks that rule according to the narrative.
1321803949796519936 2020-10-29 21:19:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NPR Actually that is lying journalism or what passes for it at @NPR.  The court split 4 - 4 (Roberts sold us out again) and no decision was reached.
1321803621323792384 2020-10-29 21:18:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sioxielegend I believe she said that she just joined the bench &amp; was not able to review the case materials in time to make a decision.  Barrett is an honest jurist.   Remember, the challenges to the Democrat Election Fruad in those states will be back.  The Court was split &amp; made no decision.
1321802772589670401 2020-10-29 21:15:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LABeachGal1 In Venezuela, one man's trash is another mans dinner.  Do you really want to elect Biden and bring that here?  Oh yeah, Bret Baier has grabbed ahold of Ryan's leg is now on the evil team over at Fox.  @OANN for the win.
1321802124452220928 2020-10-29 21:12:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @heatherjones333 @CHIZMAGA Or Obama.
1321801935742136321 2020-10-29 21:11:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 Geeze, I'd hope so.  I can't stomach the thought of 2 more years of Pelosi standing behind Trump and ripping up his State of the Union Addresses.
1321801338846547968 2020-10-29 21:09:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto It will be interesting to see if the Biden owned MSM can hide this until election day.
1321800953314439169 2020-10-29 21:07:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 Many of us do not want our jobs and our economic well being to go to China sent by a paid off Chinese asset in the WH.
1321795061982523392 2020-10-29 20:44:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tracybeanz @letgobestill @Lisa_Matassa @TuckerCarlson Actually that is exactly what they would do.  Sending the envelope on and having the breach discovered at a distant location after perhaps a number of stops is the best way to cover where the theft occurred.
1321794276666191875 2020-10-29 20:41:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Adorable_Todd Shit  I bet that the MSM is going to hide that or perhaps give Biden or Obama credit.
1321792069602406401 2020-10-29 20:32:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RightWingLawMan @bonbonllc @realDonaldTrump Another Arizona guy here.  Remember, make sure that @CaptMarkKelly is not elected.  Trump will be fighting hard for us without that lying, China loving, gun taking, Schumer sucking, fool in the Senate working against us and everything Trump wants to do.

1321789038194380802 2020-10-29 20:20:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @petefrt You left out that the Bernie people now working for Biden want to build gulags and reeducate Americans.

Everything was done in the dark with tight security; no one has any idea who pulled it off &amp; the shipping company is at a loss.  -------  In the end this was a sophisticated operation that could only have been pulled off by the Deep State.

What organization(s) have the resources to intercept a package during shipment from a National Shipping Company which would have significant security?  The Package was intercepted mid shipment and the contents removed and then allowed to continue to hide....  cont.

Someone is monitoring Trucker through internal spies and communication intercepts or both.  How else would they be aware of the documents, that they were being sent to LA, and the method.   cont.
1321779217172889605 2020-10-29 19:41:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FuctupMike Really, I get my news from @OANN so it surprises me to hear how bad Fox has become.

1321613968457101314 2020-10-29 08:44:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChrisBEsq @realDonaldTrump The greatest threat to Democracy is not indifferince it is the Democrats.
1321613671462629377 2020-10-29 08:43:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump I am proud of my state.  Go Arizona.  By the way the people there do not believe @CaptMarkKelly lies and will not let him take their guns.  This is Arizona, not a pussy blue state.
1321611409419988998 2020-10-29 08:34:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Project_Veritas Ten years and where did he get the money?
1321609648659558400 2020-10-29 08:27:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump Section 230.
1321609368702349312 2020-10-29 08:26:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 @CNN has exactly the opposite results and if anything more of an edge for Biden.  Hard to believe the MSM fake polls.
1321570845999788032 2020-10-29 05:53:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced Pennsylvania Supreme Court or US Supreme Court?
1321570154820505601 2020-10-29 05:50:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tommychong So Biden will send in the army to deal with the chumps.
1321569454518542336 2020-10-29 05:48:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Big deal!  What does @Twitter say.
1321555404397047808 2020-10-29 04:52:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joepalojoe @BreitbartNews LOL, odds are 2,789,557 to 1 against it being enforced.

1321553296490819584 2020-10-29 04:43:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenTedCruz @wvufanagent999 Actually Congress giving him Section 230 protection did.  It is easy to be a bad actor when there are no consequences.
1321552865769316353 2020-10-29 04:42:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jaketapper Just saw a national poll with 5,000 voters by telephone that gave Trump 51%, Biden 43%.  You have to stop calling @DNC offices when doing your polls.
1321541600321810434 2020-10-29 03:57:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GregAbbott_TX @GodSaveAmerica1 I recommend 115 years.  If she gives everyone up, bargin down to ten.

Just kidding, but look at the campaign contributions for a start, listen to the @Project_Veritas videos, see who they are banning.  Must be nice to be powerful enought to look the Senate in the eye and lie.
1321539620761300993 2020-10-29 03:49:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MilesTaylorUSA @realDonaldTrump You are out of sync with the rest of the country which is asking why is the @FBI and @TheJusticeDept covering for the Bidens, Obama, Hillary, and the rest of the crooked and evil crew.  PS - Read the NYPost.  It is China with the Bidens help that has our country under attack.

1321538034915893248 2020-10-29 03:43:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @donhum47 @gatewaypundit After the election, people are going to want @twitter, @facebook, and @google to be held accountable.    The power that they have is protection under the law and they do not satisfy the requirements.  They are an editor and publisher and not a neutral platform.

1321511615812886528 2020-10-29 01:58:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MAGAChronicle After the election there will be a groundswell of opinion and action to strip them of 230.  Let's see how well they do if they have to be an honest player like everyone else.
1321510649160065025 2020-10-29 01:54:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cjdtwit @DGPurser Sounds like they are pretty sure of Roberts.

1321509249487237120 2020-10-29 01:48:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @StarlingHunter1 @paulsperry_ Perhaps Zuckerberg does not know the name of the person that comes in each night and cleans out his private toilet and lays out his hand soap, but the key positions he well knows.  Chief of election security in a year like this is someone he would definitely know and monitor.
1321508451516698624 2020-10-29 01:45:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @paulsperry_ Wow, shades of Comey &amp; Rod the Weasel Rosenstein's testimony to the fact that they were to stupid to know what the people under them were doing.  Nobody knows nuffin, yet the evil gets done.
1321507773427798016 2020-10-29 01:43:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ConservVoice @gatewaypundit What a waste of time and effort and not fooling anyone.  The @FBI &amp; @TheJusticeDept has covered up for the real threat, American politicians and business people selling us to China.  This is throwing us a bone in the hope that people will shut up and go away.
1321507177522098177 2020-10-29 01:40:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Hoya97 @gatewaypundit Any word if any of the Bidens, Feinstein, Mark Kelly of AZ, or other of the Chinese business associates were charged?

1321496244397617153 2020-10-29 00:57:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced LOL, OK.  Another day another Democrat threat.  I think that threatening a Supreme Court Justice may be a crime.  Perhaps the court will find the Democrat source of the threat in contempt.

Twitter brings the hammer and then judges if it was just.  Twitter then decides if the process was fair.  The #CCP is studying this for implementation in China.  @Google will help  If twitter is fair, why does it need 230?
1321467848011608064 2020-10-28 23:04:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @illumilady Oh yeah, I so much want ot own @twitter stock. 🤣

1321461405468422149 2020-10-28 22:38:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bakoff333 Good point.  But I would encourage people to get the facts before they vote the country to China.

1321459825675440130 2020-10-28 22:32:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bakoff333 To those who have not voted yet, remember that in most states you cannot change your vote so if you vote for Biden, you are stuck.

1321451156149690368 2020-10-28 21:58:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Now that we know that Biden has committed treason &amp; sold America &amp; Americas out to China, it is time to take a look at @CaptMarkKelly, Arizona Senatorial candidate.   https://t.co/eBb6NbwQDg  What is his relationship with China &amp; is he associated with the #CCP in his enterprises?

The little old lady struggling on Social Security in the mid west will never know that she paid for a Philidelphia thugs large screen TV.
1321440021434355715 2020-10-28 21:13:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 @willbarrett_1 Perhaps he is hiding with Hunter.  We have known about the FBI and the DOJ for a long time, but this is the real moment of light and truth.  Both have protected a blatant criminal who has committed treason against the United States so that he can be elected president.

No reasonable prosecutor would file treason charges just because Biden sold out America and the American people to China, Russia, Ukraine, etc., etc., etc.

1321162558070423553 2020-10-28 02:51:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HillaryClinton @YaleGLC @AmbCdeBaca @FreetheSlaves Is this Forum being funded by China?  Just asking, otherwise are you going to call them out for the slavery there that is used to make the products of some of our larger corporations (those backing Joe)?
1321161931768561664 2020-10-28 02:48:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jimsmith1944 So when do we start seeing the complaints about lack of local shopping and requests for aid.
1321161727191388165 2020-10-28 02:47:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @captcrunch32 @FoxNews He yells because the sound of his voice tells him he has not crossed over yet.  It has to be loud for him to hear it over the hidden receiver in his ear.
1321146585779064832 2020-10-28 01:47:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RSBNetwork @LynnKuennen @realDonaldTrump I wonder if Whitmer will come on down and say hello.
1321146243926478850 2020-10-28 01:46:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jamisonfoser PS - I refer you back to the @Project_Veritas video of the @IlhanMN thug cruising around Minneapolis with a car full of ballots that he has illegally obtained and completed.  If Omar is elected based on this fraud, will you claim she represents her district?  So, stuff it. 😄
1321145570103193602 2020-10-28 01:43:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jamisonfoser 2/2 .... is concerned, your statement is also questionable &amp; so much bologna.  1st, I look back to Election Fraud. 2nd, a Senator does not receive 100% of the votes in a state &amp; many do not vote so the claim that the Democrat Minority represents the majority is smoke at best.
1321144532289777664 2020-10-28 01:39:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jamisonfoser 1/2  Wow, aren't you the whiny POS?  Simple fact, Democrats practice massive election fraud and that leaves any statement about voter numbers questionable.  I believe that it is likely that Trump won the popular vote.  It does not matter, he is President.  As far as the Senate...
1321131017801928704 2020-10-28 00:45:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kathy2trips @LadyRedWave @DebbyAJ @OANN @newsmax @dish I subbed to @OANN so get it everywhere.  I think it was about $ 60 for a year.
1321129190247165952 2020-10-28 00:38:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @rising_serpent Ten years with not time off.  That makes me sick.
1321126922353479680 2020-10-28 00:29:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DailyCaller At least now they have a chance of being born.
1321126521784856578 2020-10-28 00:28:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sjboilers2 @RealSaavedra You send for a psychologist and if you are Seattle you bring in the city pimp.  All good and all will stop a crazed armed thug in his/her tracks.
1321069920348598273 2020-10-27 20:43:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MAJMO50 @no_silenced As the police stand there and let thugs throw 💩 at them, once realizes that this is a Democrat elected official sanctioned riot and looting spree and the cops are ordered not to fight back (which would end it quickly).  Vote Democrat if this is what you want for America.
1321068645724794881 2020-10-27 20:38:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HillaryClinton Actually I am most happy and pleased.  You probably are referring to the evil leftist coup addicted little sheeple in your flock.  After over 4 years of their attacks, lies, and criminal corruption, I don't care what they think.  Democrat haters would be unhappy in any case.
1321062752744452096 2020-10-27 20:14:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @USA_Anne711 @cathyspartanj Hahahahaha  That says it all about @twitter.
1321060898853720065 2020-10-27 20:07:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChanelRion @bbusa617 @OANN Can't wait until 11/04 when Wray's ass is fired.  He probably will end up at @twitter, @google, @Netflix, or on the board of @CNN or other place that will value his loyalty to the cause.  Time to clean the @FBI from top to bottom or just get rid of it.
1321059922918817792 2020-10-27 20:03:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DGPurser @Christi21769780 Phuck, I need some new shoes.  Time to check @CNN and see if anyone was shot.
1321059668743966721 2020-10-27 20:02:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LilRichie420 @tcraig57 And people vote for these morons?  Defies all sense.
1321059471867588612 2020-10-27 20:01:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ezridersos @UghToHillary @100PercFEDUP Philadelphia will be petitioning for federal aid to rebuild what the citizens of the city destroyed last night.  Pelosi will probably blackmail America with a few billions for Philly.  It is how a Democrat city and gov't runs.
1321058419818729473 2020-10-27 19:57:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Good Morning fellow Deplorable Chumpsters.  I woke up with a smile on my face.  The evil Satan riding Democrats woke to tears and refueled hatred.  It is going to be a good day.
1321057579787669505 2020-10-27 19:54:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bbusa617 @CNN is pretty shoddy, don't you think?
1321057144146292736 2020-10-27 19:52:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DFBHarvard The left wants the fix to be in, the right an honest legal opinion.  Trump wants an honest gov't that functions under the constitution.  Perhaps that is why the the Hill says Barrett is a vote for Trump.
1321056482641604610 2020-10-27 19:49:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cjtruth @KidukSong "We are not going to let our country be sold out to the Chinese Communist Party".  Has anyone told @CaptMarkKelly , running for Senator in Arizona, that?  He has extensive business and financial ties to China and stands to make a killing if he and Biden are elected.
1321055330596388864 2020-10-27 19:45:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @flightcrew @LyndaG1963 @realDonaldTrump America First.
1321054975930159106 2020-10-27 19:43:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LadyRedWave @DebbyAJ LOL, the MSM is so bad that you have to read Australian newspapers to get American news.  There is always @OANN if you want honest and complete news from an American source.
1321053796210913280 2020-10-27 19:39:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec @KidukSong There are many issues to consider in this election.  The rioting and street violence is one.  The choice is simple.  You can vote Democrat and this will be your life, your future. You can vote Republican and it will end quickly.  Choose wisely.
1321053021099364355 2020-10-27 19:35:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @dkrwilliams Might be worth checking if you can change away from Biden and other blues.  The MSM is trying to keep the contents of Hunters laptop and other information away from you, so you do not change your vote away from Biden.
1321052260873351168 2020-10-27 19:32:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @robbipl If he is elected, will the Squad expand to a 5th member?  https://t.co/TqDsvF1vjF

1321043749372215296 2020-10-27 18:59:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrAndyNgo Vote Democrat and this can be your town too

1320890831461470208 2020-10-27 08:51:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BreitbartNews Hey @CaptMarkKelly who is trying to con the people of Arizona into believing that you will not take their guns.  Stop lying &amp; own up.  If you were in the Senate now, you would have voted against Barrett.  That is why you should not be elected.  You will represent Schumer not us.
1320889203148795905 2020-10-27 08:45:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenFeinstein Shove it.  Signed An American Citizen.
1320888977079980033 2020-10-27 08:44:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> To the Republican Senators (except @SenatorCollins ) , I am much proud of you.  You did good today and with a simple vote you did much to protect America and the American people.  Thank you.
1320885020257517569 2020-10-27 08:28:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TMirkin Now that is funny.
1320884794830454784 2020-10-27 08:27:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TimRunsHisMouth @ChuckCallesto Now they have to look at the PA state court ruling about non matching signatures.
1320884367623770113 2020-10-27 08:25:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FuctupMike I have not checked but I think it was announce no, not one Democrat voted to confirm.  That is why all the Democrats must be voted out.
1320884072625811456 2020-10-27 08:24:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AOC May not be constitutional.  Be interesting if that got to the Supreme Court.  🤣
1320883675781758978 2020-10-27 08:23:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> To all evil hateful Democrats  Phuck Ewe and the Satan deity your road in on.
1320883131306496001 2020-10-27 08:20:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LeftyPuppetMan @kylie_oneil75 @BreitbartNews I want my guns because I am faithful to NEVER AGAIN.  If, when, they come for you don't come sniveling to those who will fight.  You get the last word and then I will block you because I have little tolerance for ignorance.  After four years of lies and deception I am done.

1320854553735032834 2020-10-27 06:27:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenSusanCollins You are voting with the Democrats in the Supreme Court justice nomination that may determine the fate of our country.  Stick it.
1320852861702422534 2020-10-27 06:20:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealSaavedra Interesting that Wallace did not challenge her lie about Bider answering the questions.
1320852476589846528 2020-10-27 06:19:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> What a crock of BS.

1320839746046717953 2020-10-27 05:28:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @charliekirk11 He mumbled something incoherent to his 12 adoring sheeple admirers before his "people" hustled him away.
1320839192612515841 2020-10-27 05:26:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kylie_oneil75 @BreitbartNews Hey, this liar is running for Senator of Arizona and will take away our guns.  Here he is with his Antifa, Anti-Semitic, Anti-American, election fraud, embezzling from her campaign friends who he endorsed.  She wants you disarmed too.  https://t.co/MDD4TrGWfI
1320838563403948033 2020-10-27 05:23:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @OANN "Hunter’s personal attorney has denied the claims and has stated the story is completely untrue."  Apparently there was no fight with his wife and he did not storm out.  Hunter just left for a little R&amp;R with Chinese Hookers and a little Coke provided by the #CCP.
1320837838426927104 2020-10-27 05:20:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Hoya97 @BreitbartNews The people who love God and reject all that is evil have to stand as one against Cuomo.  He may be NYC's darling but he is a contemptuous mass murderer and cannot be allowed to reinstate Hitler's vision.  NEVER AGAIN.
1320837292974485504 2020-10-27 05:18:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChunkyTWshngtn TBH, I don't give 2 cents about 50 cents.

1320832982538567680 2020-10-27 05:01:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JamesOKeefeIII @egatz4u2 LOL, I retweeted this but am shadow banned so am not sure anyone has seen my retweet.  Such is the wonder of @Twitter   I can't wait until after 11/03.  I wonder if Twitter has a Plan B when Trump wins and they are sitting there with a lot of very pissed off users, his base.
1320831629359673344 2020-10-27 04:56:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @happydays151 @TVNewsHQ And the joke is on the leftist sheeple because they dispise Kamala and showed definitively during the primaries that they don't want her.  The Democrats pucked their own.
1320831175489798144 2020-10-27 04:54:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TVNewsHQ @QellyAnon Wow.  Biden needs nursing care and not to be on the campaign trail.  He has totally lost his faculties and likely without being drugged up, is not capable of functioning.
1320830060857683968 2020-10-27 04:50:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jsolomonReports Since Trump has the votes, this is all for show.  She thinks she will win her Senate race by throwing the left a bone.  She also thinks she will get the "at least she is not a scummy Democrat vote".   Seeing the turnout that Trump's impromptu visit to Maine drew, I am not so sure
1320829308059799552 2020-10-27 04:47:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @perfectsliders The Democrats.

There are a few choices like @OANN and foreign news, but nothing in the American mainstream.  I am tired of being lied to.  I am tired of having news hidden by our news services.

Cuomo and De Blasio are anti Semitic and sending out thugs with badges to hastle the NY people.  NEVER AGAIN.

1320782492513624064 2020-10-27 01:40:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CaliTrumpLady @GenZConservati1 @SenatorCollins is garbage.  The only argument in her favor that I have seen is that she is better than Democrat.  I am not sure if that is true and am working on that one.  Not voting for Barrett, even knowing that she is going to win without her, is pure pandering to the left.
1320772715893043203 2020-10-27 01:02:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HillaryClinton How does that compare to the number of Americans that are dead because they knew to much about you?
1320770314075160577 2020-10-27 00:52:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FuctupMike Barr?

1320769875644616705 2020-10-27 00:50:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HillaryClinton I think Joe feels the same way and may make a statement from his basement where he is hiding from the discovery of his extensive criminal activity as VP and the fact that his mental capabilities are gone.  I understand your problem, a majority of honest jurists is bad for you.
1320769225049292800 2020-10-27 00:48:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @P8R1OT You mean 5-4, Roberts is a pile of leftist 💩.
1320769082711396352 2020-10-27 00:47:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dbongino Trump will be president on 11/04 and Wray should be sacked then.
1320768952662777857 2020-10-27 00:47:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Jim_Jordan Nicely put as a gentleman.  But lets face it, Wray is a deep state coupster who is pure scum.  He was brought in to clean up the agency and his corruption may have ended it.
1320768644343681029 2020-10-27 00:45:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kylie_oneil75 Yes, last 4 years was discovery and defense.  Next 4 years, is our downs.  Looks like a lot of DC flotsam needs to update their resume to look for honest work.

1320767657163935744 2020-10-27 00:42:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @reubing Depends on the amount of election fraud the Democrats can get away with.

1320707914215030785 2020-10-26 20:44:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @waltmossberg I thought Biden was going to hide in his basement until 11/04 so there would be no rallies to cover.  Besides not many watched his six person extravaganzas.  Sounds like you want to block Trump's because of the crowd size and the fact it is one place the truth can't be hidden.
1320698097651994632 2020-10-26 20:05:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Crossbearer1956 Was @SenatorCollins there?

1320533726346969088 2020-10-26 09:12:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @atensnut @ChuckCallesto I just signed.   What a pleasure.
1320533116826497025 2020-10-26 09:10:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MSNBC Now do Joe hiding in his basement for the final days before the election.
1320532581742374912 2020-10-26 09:07:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @P8R1OT To some degree this is good for the American people to see.  Biden is nothing, a corrupt &amp; perv small man.  But the light on MSM, social media, FBI, DOJ, CIA, etc showing them protecting him is eye opening, illuminating.  The organs of our gov't and media have shown what they are
1320530428407599104 2020-10-26 08:59:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Vandevere9988 What did Barr know and when did he know it.
1320529426761744391 2020-10-26 08:55:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec I am wondering about Barr.  Time to clean the whole house.  Trump won't fire Wray until the 4th because he does not want to give the #FakeNews a cause to scream about.
1320528230839840768 2020-10-26 08:50:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Chris_1791 @FoxNews She is up for reelection in a close race.  Let's see if the conservatives in her state come out for her.  Is she better than the Democrat?
1320527483129614338 2020-10-26 08:47:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @V_actually @kh93291 Some people, the working poor, fell into the crack.  They did not have employer insurance but made to much to get on Medicaid or the like.  Obama fined them a lot and took food, rent, clothing, etc. money.  For them it was brutal and caused much hardship.  Democrats suck.
1320526690133528576 2020-10-26 08:44:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @V_actually @kh93291 There are a lot of reasons.  One example:  Man is 68 &amp; on Medicare.  Works part time, because pension is not adequate.  Wife is 63.  They cannot afford Obamacare for her.  So the result is that the barely surviving elderly ends up paying a stiff fine which take food money.
1320509883259650048 2020-10-26 07:37:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gimleteyeLA @AMErikaNGIRLLL @joshdcaplan @NYPD Obama / Biden / Hillary &amp; the cast of 1,000 thieves are gone.  Peace breaking out Truth about the evil &amp; corruption of the Obama / Biden era is becoming known China stopped Jobs coming back No Obamacare penalties Military rebuilt  And on and on and on.  Yes, much better off.

1320507417495359488 2020-10-26 07:27:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CNN Like @CNN #FakeNews the social media companies have discredited themselves.  Someone should tell them that the business model of attacking a good portion of their users and suppressing the news and information does not cut it.  Banning, blocking, stripping followers, etc.
1320504214670376960 2020-10-26 07:15:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TeamTrump @TheRISEofROD @realDonaldTrump @SenatorCollins IDK, was she there?  Maybe I missed her.
1320504056423481344 2020-10-26 07:14:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TeamTrump @TheRISEofROD @realDonaldTrump Interesting.  Trump is in Maine and draws a large impromptu crowd and @SenatorCollins who is up and fighting for her life is nowhere to be seen.  She will be voting against an incredibly qualified SCOTUS nominee tomorrow for no discernable reason.  What is up with her?
1320502074535145472 2020-10-26 07:06:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RedWalrus1 OMG.  It just gets better and better.  Don't every forget that Biden and Harris are the best of the Democrats.
1320501329849061382 2020-10-26 07:03:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GeorgePapa19 I think that Biden's strongest play now is to hide.
1320498140856791040 2020-10-26 06:51:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @XArmandKleinX @sulkyracer Yup.  Very well said.

1320497089856507904 2020-10-26 06:46:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @someone97393419 @MrAndyNgo @LOPolice The law has flipped and now protects the criminals and penalizes the innocent.  You can go to jail faster for defending yourself, home, and neighborhood, than the perps can for burning them down.  Remove the police and the thugs are fair game and the attacks end.
1320495734764961793 2020-10-26 06:41:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Steve_Stuck @MrAndyNgo @LOPolice How do you know that those women are from LO?  The way Antifa / BLM work is that they bus in the harpies.
1320494641037234176 2020-10-26 06:37:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrAndyNgo @LOPolice I lived in LO for five years before the leftists took over Portland and destroyed that beautiful city.  All I can say, if BLM / Antifa came onto my property, they would be carried off.  Sometimes I think the police actually are there to protect the Antifa types.
1320493589374275584 2020-10-26 06:32:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MikeMan67771347 @SHEILAFLINT1 It does not matter what I believe, but I will tell you one thing that I do.  Who the puck is Starbucks to dictate what I think and threaten to deny me their product if I don't tow the line.  Puck them, I don't drink their coffee anyway because it is over sugared impure crap.
1320490709149888512 2020-10-26 06:21:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Wow, they have pulled the plug.
1320488005224648705 2020-10-26 06:10:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marklevinshow Perhaps this is being done by order of Cuomo, but it is being done by the @NYPD.  NEVER AGAIN!  Following orders did not cut it then and following orders does not cut it now.

1320483050401087489 2020-10-26 05:51:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @akeyak @TimesofIsrael I disagree that you are Jewish.  You may have been born into the people and mouth words at Temple, but anyone who is backing the party of Anti-Semitism, evil, and hate has betrayed the Jewish people, the Jewish heritage, and God.  NEVER AGAIN has meaning.  Some are Soros.
1320480930893418496 2020-10-26 05:42:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mistim @AwakenedAndMad So would I except that is NYC and they are attacking Jews.  Seems that the Democrats have legalized that.  I would say two things:  NEVER AGAIN, and Self Defense.  Don't expect police protection.  Oh yeah, no mercy.
1320475837506875392 2020-10-26 05:22:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RBReich So what is Joe up to now.  He he called it a lid for the rest of the campaign season.
1320475587924824064 2020-10-26 05:21:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MagnanoDiane @williamlharbuck Isn't that the state where @SenatorCollins use to be senator?  I wonder how she feels phucking over her own people?

1320460633473568768 2020-10-26 04:22:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CorporalBen I think most Jews get Cuomo and De Blassio.  https://t.co/z8CEtlbbG5

1320456531486277632 2020-10-26 04:05:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joshdcaplan Time for the @NYPD to stand up and be counted or just become Cuomo and De Blasio's little bitches.

Satan sucking anarchists likely see the Biden corruption &amp; treason as a "good" &amp; view Hunter as one of their own.

1320333489577684992 2020-10-25 19:56:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @vicksiern @SpinePainBegone I went for 500+.  Guy can't make it for more than an hour and that is good money for a little work.  Besides, I can sleep or text or listen to music on my earphones while he spews his lies.
1320182586946187264 2020-10-25 09:57:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Good night Arizona  As a parting thought, @CaptMarkKelly the guy dressed as Hitler, has endorsed an Anti-Semitic, Anti-American, Election Fraudster who has broken more laws that I can count  Here is a group shot with her Antifa Daughter who took part in the burning of Minneapolis  https://t.co/6ldvmzO0iY

There is a lesson here.  Never vote for a Democrat for any office, because even one in a position of power will do everything possible to screw things up.

Take a look at how he bilked Arizona out of $ 15,000,000.  But this is about character &amp; hate.  Kelly has endorsed Anti American, Anti Semitic, Anti Christian @IlhanMN  https://t.co/DXLMBT27mN

If I gave him nothing &amp; voted Trump would I get to come &amp; see him?  That begs 2 questions?  First, as President of the US, shouldn't Joe represent me?  Second, what do you call it if he sees those who pay?
1320130091259621376 2020-10-25 06:28:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump My guess is that we both voted for the same Presidential Candidate.  The vote and the ability to vote Trump were both a great honor.

We had all seen him promise the opposite but he lied and then dared the President to put it on tape.  WTF is going on?  He had to know that there were dozens of videos that prove he was lying.  Contempt?

I wonder if the Chinese will get a discount, two for one, if Biden wins.

As opposed to the doctors working on the Chinese plague now. 2. Get gud medical stuffs.  As opposed to the current bad medical stuff. 3. Test a lot.  As opposed to the lot of testing being done. &amp; 4. Do gud stuffz.
1320023015451578368 2020-10-24 23:23:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kristenluvslife @papacass84 It happens to me as well.  Probably a Twitter thing to do to know Trump supporters.  PS - I proofed this twice, wonder how it will turn out.
1320022599187886080 2020-10-24 23:21:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @my3monkees @realDonaldTrump So the Democrat mayors let their army of thugs burn their cities down and Pelosi blackmails the company for relief if the American people will not pay for it.  Sounds very Democrat to me.  No deal.
1320001416547635200 2020-10-24 21:57:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GenZConservati1 @EricMMatheny Hollywood is now selling its crap to China where the market is beginning to outstrip the US.  Now you understand why the Hollywood elites have sold us out.

1319999368364134401 2020-10-24 21:49:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Patrici15767099 He is a Democrat.  He lies, he cheats, he bulls shats his constituents.  Nothing new or shocking there.
1319999069264121856 2020-10-24 21:47:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CBSNews Do you have a legally binding contract?  Let's face it, you can whine a river but the Trump admin. has learned how to protect itself from Democrat Propaganda #FakeNews.
1319998498545152001 2020-10-24 21:45:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DavidWaddell5 @Franklinstein07 Well, when that gets to the real SCOTUS at least there will be a tie breaking vote.  I don't believe that the PA Supreme Court has authority in Federal Issues and this will impact Federal Elections.
1319997502674776064 2020-10-24 21:41:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kramerreport LOL, Obama in a box.  He must be fuming, but he needs Biden to win very badly.

The agency appears to feel secure in the depth of its corruption.  I doubt if much of America has regard or respect for the agency.

He is getting millions and millions to pound my states people with a constant flow of 🐂💩.  A lot of special interests from dark sources are backing him.

He is close to the Anti-Semite, Christian hating, America despising @IlhanMN.  He is lying to Arizona about everything especially taking our guns.  Hitler, Omar, guns --&gt; Typical Democrat.
1319990735442096131 2020-10-24 21:14:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Excalib88557245 @sewpc123 @MAGAinChicago @Solmemes1 Yup.  But before they come for us, they come for our guns.  That is why taking down #2A is a Democrat necessity.

He endorsed @IlhanMN and his wife is hugging her Antifa daughter that took part in the sacking and firing of Minneapolis.  https://t.co/IQitynaggD
1319989355281145856 2020-10-24 21:09:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @QuintonWard10 Agree.  The ducks are in a row.  Time to go get them.

1319984000006406146 2020-10-24 20:48:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @visitJanet @SgtVac LOL, everyone at the @FBI and @TheJusticeDept should update their resume.  Other agencies as well.  America may be moving toward a smaller, efficient, and honest bureaucracy.  Wouldn't that be something?

1319981861385371649 2020-10-24 20:39:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @laststandofusa @Purrpatrol Interesting that in light of the Biden's relationship with China and the goings on there, that the Arizona Democrat Senatorial Candidate @CaptMarkKelly is also tied in to the Chinese as well.   https://t.co/ui1uM7dL6o  I would hate to have Democrats in DC who will sell us out.
1319980888617222144 2020-10-24 20:35:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LoriRhae @Cocofritz I have been tweeting about @CaptMarkKelly 's lies about taking our guns, bilking Arizona out of $ 15,000,000, and his close ties to Anti-Semite America hater @IlhanMN , and some other "stuff".  But Kelly's relationships with China and Chinese interests are disconcerting as well.
1319978098486505472 2020-10-24 20:24:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ari_russian I wonder how Biden entertains himself while alone in his basement.
1319977512412139520 2020-10-24 20:22:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TrumpWarRoom @Observant_mind Funny!  I wonder why Cory Booker is singing a different song now.  Maybe when he dropped out, all of Biden's offenses and hate toward the black community disappeared.
1319976679209484288 2020-10-24 20:18:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CynthiaRunnels1 @realDonaldTrump Hahahahaha  That sums it up.

1319975858568740864 2020-10-24 20:15:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jennifermcfarl4 @charliekirk11 Now why would anyone think that @CaptMarkKelly is an Anti-Semite, anti American, pro Antifa, hater?  Who is the left going to come after once they get the Jews?  https://t.co/g30XETluEU
1319974609672794112 2020-10-24 20:10:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CCM1956 @thrillisgone Wrong!  He has not dropped out of the race for being a lying and corrupt politician in 2020.
1319974341279240193 2020-10-24 20:09:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lor65 Vote with your brain and follow your soul.
1319973875736739840 2020-10-24 20:07:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Thomas1774Paine Meh, there is a saying at the @FBI, "There is no Clinton crime to big for us to cover up".  Just joking, maybe.

1319973173765394432 2020-10-24 20:05:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ACTBrigitte @fedagentmark Actually it may be a year before the Democrats stop finding ballots to count.
1319972227903729664 2020-10-24 20:01:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods This is a must watch for every senior and vet because Biden will destroy them and every American because they can plainly see that Biden lies about the most important issues facing them.
1319971825405759489 2020-10-24 19:59:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LABeachGal1 If you are a senior, a vet, anyone who has paid in and is dependent on the return, Biden will destroy you.  No vulerable American is safe from him.  It is amazing how glibly he lies and with such faux conviction.  Even knowing that there is proof of his lies he continues.
1319970532264009728 2020-10-24 19:54:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MarthaW19860146 @WingsofCrystal @susangarnett11 @lissasno1fan @cspanwj PS - They are brothers and sisters with the Latinos that escaped the same evil in Cuba, Venezuela, and other countries.  A common bond exists between those who have lived under the yoke.
1319970157062598657 2020-10-24 19:53:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MarthaW19860146 @WingsofCrystal @susangarnett11 @lissasno1fan @cspanwj God Bless them.  I can't even imagine the horror of escaping Marxist dictatorships to get to America and see the Democrats working to bring that here.  There is no where to go, no where to hide if the left takes over.
1319969212262039552 2020-10-24 19:49:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @americanshomer @LyndaG1963 @CaptMarkKelly @IlhanMN PS - If you see fit to retweet this chain, please do so.  Arizona is my state and Ameica my country and I would not have someone like Kelly elected because people only saw the lies in his massive TV 🐂💩campaign.  I want the best for all in my state and my country.  Thank you.

He has extensive (questionable?) business ties with China.  Considering Biden's sell out of America, I do not trust him one bit  He endorsed Anti-Semite @IlhanMN
1319967345712992259 2020-10-24 19:41:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @americanshomer @LyndaG1963 @CaptMarkKelly 2/3  Most importantly for Arizona and America is that he is a Schumer sucking Democrat who would contribute to their majority and follow orders; pack court, open borders, destroy medical care for single pay, etc.  He is lying to us about our guns.  He would work to destroy #2A.
1319966784137486336 2020-10-24 19:39:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @americanshomer @LyndaG1963 1/3  Good.  Disclaimer, I, my family, &amp; everyone I know voted for McSally.  I made a contribution to her.  My reasons for voting for McSally were positive, but I have more negitive reasons for voting against @CaptMarkKelly .  He is lying to Arizoan about everything  .............  https://t.co/FqUNEvPEq2

I am pleased to tell you I voted for McSally as did my family and everyone I know.  Omar is an Anti-Semite &amp; you dressed as Hitler in High School.
1319804921789624320 2020-10-24 08:56:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CaptMarkKelly No you are running to make money and get in on the China Bucks that Joe has tapped.  Tell us about your China businesses and connections.  You lie to Arizona people about guns.  You bilked them out of $ 15,000,000.  You suck on Schumer's #### while lying about being independent.  https://t.co/YaLHnKTs5u

1319783761492365312 2020-10-24 07:32:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @P8R1OT So if you are a young girl in Delaware and are abused by a Biden, don't go to the police because they are useless.  If this was any other person what would have happened?

1319765667797635072 2020-10-24 06:20:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NBCPolitics Tax increase, More regulation, Destroy energy sector, More lockdowns, Open country to illegals, Open country to being flooded with Chinese goods, Etc.  Yeah, it is just a shot in the dark that the country is going to go down the shitter &amp; stock market will tank.  #FakeNews
1319748092757905408 2020-10-24 05:10:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @pepesgrandma That is illegal and unconstitutional.  Hey @NYPD WTF are you doing.  Every thug in NYC is after you and you are attacking the Jews.  WTF?  Just disgusting.
1319747714515496961 2020-10-24 05:09:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NoRemorseAFVET4 The Democrat party has morphed into the true successor to the Nazi party.  NEVER AGAIN  And after the Jews, who?  I am disgusted with the @NYPD "following orders".  The city wants to destroy them and they obey and attack the Jewish Community.  Disgusting.
1319746812161392640 2020-10-24 05:05:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LionTedPride In simple terms, Biden wins means you and America are phucked.
1319744825818632193 2020-10-24 04:57:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Solmemes1 The NYPD has just lost my sympathy.  Following orders is very Nazi.  The Jewish people better remember and remember never again and get rid of every Democrat in government.  After the Jews, they will come for the Catholics.

So Obamacare made medical insurance to expensive to afford and introduced huge deductibles and then whapped you hard if you could not afford the mandated garbage.

Who will take their guns so that they cannot protect themselves Biden or Trump.  Who will destroy the future of the children in the suburbs as has been done in the cities?

1319319989606731779 2020-10-23 00:49:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SteveGuest Yuck Fou America.  Pelosi does not have the time to address the question of Biden's rampant corruption and obvious treason.  Think she is afraid of a follow up asking what part did her son play in the entire mess.  Maybe, she is avoiding why she impeached Trump on a hoax &amp; a lie.

It is a small sample, but the enthusiasm is greater from what I can see.  Besides, how long would Social Security and Medicare continue to exist under a Biden Administration?  Seniors know that.

1319308287397957633 2020-10-23 00:03:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ReallyKW @PolitixGal Since Hunter's laptop had nudes of her grandaughter?, Hunters niece, with Hunter and Joe lip kissed her on stage for the world to see, shouldn't Jill be concerned about her and not the predators who took advantage of her?

Will he sell us out as a Senator?  Who do you believe, Kelly or your lying eyes?  PS - If he is elected kiss your guns bye, bye.  You know that he is lying about that.
1319280895321206792 2020-10-22 22:14:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @newtgingrich Boy have we, the American people, been abused in a way that a code of decency will not let me say.  I am not shocked that China has bought America.  I am shocked how many of our leaders, elites, have sold us out.
1319280211343495169 2020-10-22 22:11:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @USMCMIL03 An ancillary question is did Joe have his sniffer in there as well?  One starts to wonder if Hunter is as he is because of abuse as a child.  Drugs, pedo, criminality, spinning out of control, etc. are text book reactions to severe trauma when he was very young.  What a family!

The knowingly voted to remove an "innocent" man from office.  They voted to invalidate the votes of Americans who voted for Trump.  No Democrat should be in office.
1319246981760315393 2020-10-22 19:59:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RonaldBruceBar3 No matter what any Democrat says, it is a lie.  They will always vote against you and America.    The truth does not matter.  Your well being does not matter.  The country does not matter.  They are Democrats.

If you were a criminal, would you vote for Biden / Harris.  It is perfectly understandable why the Democrat team wanted to set the criminals free.

That is, those who do not have enough money to escape like the NYC elites.  Some are starting to anticipate Leftist / Democrat rampages after the election.

1318980878081536000 2020-10-22 02:22:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BernieSanders Already voted for Trump, McSally, Biggs, and everyone red on the ballot.  Even checked out the judges because I don't want some scummy leftist on the bench.  Thank you for asking.    Hey, while I have you.  Are your guys who moved over to the Biden camp still planning Gulags?
1318977549297274880 2020-10-22 02:08:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @larrywblanks @RyanAFournier @CountryPhy @fbis Wow look.  A leftist cockroach, possibly a fake account has something to say.  I shun such.  Bye.
1318977259034738688 2020-10-22 02:07:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @donwinslow Trump, no contest.  PS - I don't believe you.
1318976867437735937 2020-10-22 02:06:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Blaine_James_TX @marwilliamson Gulags, can you say gulags.  Remember the @Project_Veritas videos where the Bernie people were talking about rounding people up &amp; putting them in Gulags.  They work for Biden now, although currently talking guillotines.   Just being satirical, but the gulag / guillotines are true
1318966897266683908 2020-10-22 01:26:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NickAdamsinUSA no
1318959544043667456 2020-10-22 00:57:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @polishprincessh @no_silenced Much sad.  RIP, brave soul.
1318959333510541317 2020-10-22 00:56:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @1st5d @Erumara1 LOL, that would be the corker.
1318958864839053312 2020-10-22 00:54:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @arnie_w_coconut @ChanelRion @OANN 100%  Now show me @CNNs
1318958610081181697 2020-10-22 00:53:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @roxyloveslucy @GaryBla67480087 @ChanelRion @OANN @OANN is very savy.  No way they do not have buckets of proof of their comments no matter how they are interpreted.
1318958368086634496 2020-10-22 00:52:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GaryBla67480087 @ChanelRion @OANN Good idea.  Let's get all the stuff into court in a civil law suit.  It should make for an interesting disclosure.
1318957752522219521 2020-10-22 00:50:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChanelRion @KickinBrass1 @OANN Hey, what is a little pedophilia among Democrats.  It is not like the @FBI would do anything about a connected Democrat abusing little children.  I am still waiting for the Epstein (may he RIP 🤣) generated indictments.  Remember, the pedo does not fall far from the hair sniffer.
1318956873907806208 2020-10-22 00:46:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JimHawk67327371 To bad the @FBI is sitting around looking at the 14 year old's nudes on Hunters laptop.  Otherwise this threat to voters all over the country with respect to an election would be something they could take a look at.
1318956407312404485 2020-10-22 00:44:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @tweeta_wood Wow, this comment, true as can be, got every leftist cockroach to crawl out of their dank dark hiding places and bleat like irate sheeple.  PS - EA, ASA, MAAA, MSPA Pension Actuary and Trump is stating absolutely truth.  If Biden wins, kiss your 401k bye bye.
1318954475550199810 2020-10-22 00:37:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SC_Blues_RESIST @realDonaldTrump Why are the Billionaires backing Biden then?  Hey blue person, you are a crock of 💩 .  PS - This average non billionaire got a nice tax cut under Trump and got rid of the Obamacare despicable penalty.  Democrat - Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies and more lies.
1318953480644567040 2020-10-22 00:33:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Been hearing that the stock market will crash from every leftist turnip for four years.  Keep trying, if Biden is elected you likely will be right.
1318952420043497472 2020-10-22 00:28:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @tweeta_wood A taxed 401(k) will not be worth having.  The whole appeal is to be able to save tax free for retirement &amp; then manage taxes when you take the money.  Add a plummeted &amp; killed stock market where your retirement assets are invested.  Biden will make getting old a trip into poverty
1318951273949847554 2020-10-22 00:24:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LauraLiberty45 @Tia6sc Treason, pay for play, nudes and disgusting sex photos of you girls, selling of America to declared enemies, and on and on and on.  These are not things that concern the @FBI especially when done by a Democrat.
1318950140779003904 2020-10-22 00:19:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HillaryClinton Speaking of jaw-dropping corruption, I hear you have a birthday coming up.    Monday, the same day Barrett will be confirmed to the 9th seat, giving a conservative majority without compromised Roberts.    So America will be getting a birthday present on your birthday.  Ironic! 🤣
1318930433661313024 2020-10-21 23:01:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KelemenCari You mean under the table, do you not?
1318930260465836035 2020-10-21 23:00:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @fedagentmark That is where we would live.  Now show her neighborhood.
1318929572352593920 2020-10-21 22:58:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NickAdamsinUSA Yes.  So many crimes, so many charges to pick from.
1318929205329981445 2020-10-21 22:56:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EvanAKilgore @JoeBiden Yes.
1318929044537110528 2020-10-21 22:56:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JudgeJeaninefan @dinadahl You also need an already have movement.
1318928734884302848 2020-10-21 22:54:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Thomas1774Paine Extortion or blackmail?  I am not up on criminal threats.
1318928347955486720 2020-10-21 22:53:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DeAnna4Congress The Democrats should switch to, you have to vote for us to see who you elected.  Can't turn out worse than Obamacare, last time they did it.  Besides a vote for Biden is really a vote Harris who will be taking orders from someone else.
1318898039344431104 2020-10-21 20:52:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CNNPolitics So does Disney, Apple, Nike, Google, the NBA, Hollywood Studios (movies), etc., etc., etc.  Anyone who does business internationally and in China likely does.  The point is that Biden sold out the country and helped China along with its plans of our demise.
1318896946182983680 2020-10-21 20:48:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sayitnspinit Is that real?
1318891181472841730 2020-10-21 20:25:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @laurenboebert @LucySullivan888 There will not be lines for gov't rationed food because there likely will be none.  For example, Cuba a few months ago told its people that they are on their own.  We will more likely see a generation or two of dumpster divers for dinner like Venezuela, or millions die like China
1318890299079360513 2020-10-21 20:22:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MamaReg2 @fletch63_d @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Seems like book deals, work as a talking head on @CNN, and gigs on @Netflix are the ways corrupt Democrat politicans are compensated.
1318888829156118532 2020-10-21 20:16:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dranoworks @thebradfordfile BS  A boss that can be impeached at the drop of a hat and for exercising his constitutional authority must be careful.  A boss that fires the people who are running a secret hoax investigation and can be impeached for that must be careful.  A boss with the MSM spewing lies......
1318888262044274690 2020-10-21 20:14:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SineMetu444 @EmeraldRobinson @TheRISEofROD @newsmax Hi there, do you have pictures of underage children on your computer?  I am sure the police would like to know.
1318888020913745920 2020-10-21 20:13:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EmeraldRobinson @newsmax It is interesting to note that if Giuliani provided the pictures to the public so we could see the depth of perversion the hair sniffers son is involved in, he could be charged with child porn.  Think about that.
1318887274717663232 2020-10-21 20:10:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sethjlevy @ckolacia You are discounting massive election fraud by the Democrats.
1318887134024007680 2020-10-21 20:09:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DrShayPhD @bbbraner You bet.  WI is a beautiful state with great people.  Don't let the Democrats destroy that.  The Governor has been on the attack.  Fight back with your votes.  A vote for a Democrat is a vote against yourself and your family.
1318886619651342337 2020-10-21 20:07:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TeaBoots @laneylane25 NYC is waging war against its Jewish residents.  Any Jew that votes for a Democrat anywhere in the US is helping those who are attacking them.  When I grew up in NYC we had delis, Italian Bakeries, Chinese Resturnts, Pizza, and on and on.  De Blasio and Cuomo are destroying that.
1318885218388881408 2020-10-21 20:01:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Athletics3rdGen @MontyNishimura And remember, @CaptMarkKelly is lying to the people of Arizona and will take our guns if elected.  He is lying about a lot of things, but this is a #2A tweet and I will leave it at you can judge a person by the company they keep.  Is this you, Arizona?  https://t.co/74ZC9hVv5Y

1318713077282467840 2020-10-21 08:37:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RyanAFournier @CountryPhy Don't underestimate the @FBIs ability to cover up crimes against America and the American people.  There is no Democrat crime that the FBI will honestly investigate.
1318712310496555008 2020-10-21 08:34:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @drjasonnichols So what?  This just shows how corrupt &amp; uncaring about the US, intel officials are.  They would back a treasonous traitor who sold us all out, rather than have their ex agencies reformed.  God only knows what would be turned up about them with honest leadership in their agencies.
1318679228603199489 2020-10-21 06:23:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HillaryClinton In two weeks and one day, we could call this birthday girl Madam President.  That would really stick it to the loyal Democrat sheeple who voted for a stick in the eye over her in the primaries.
1318678717959335936 2020-10-21 06:21:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @thebradfordfile @Rigged_It Yup, yup, yup.  Biden has been selling us out for as long as he has been in Congress.
1318678385665568768 2020-10-21 06:20:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sioxielegend @ChuckGrassley @tpdeod32 @realDonaldTrump Yeah, Iran would go for it.
1318678184880001024 2020-10-21 06:19:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenSchumer Just read you lost.  Tough 💩.  Healthcare?  The only way a Democrat would care about anything is if China told them to.
1318677672294109190 2020-10-21 06:17:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marycjoyce2 @chuckschumer Just @chuckschumer doing his little @CNN style thing for the sheeple faithful.  He was never serious and no one took him seriously.
1318676242883727361 2020-10-21 06:11:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenMcSallyAZ @Jan99464119 @azcentral It has been my great pleasure (and my family's) to vote for you.  Much luck to you.
1318675986590826496 2020-10-21 06:10:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DVSanders1 @KimInTulsa @gatewaypundit Maybe a heartfelt appeal to China will get them to come in and bail him out.
1318675513724989440 2020-10-21 06:08:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PeteButtigieg Whenever anyone is in court to push election fraud and disenfranchise Americans for power and greed (I'm talking about you, Democrats), we don't have to ask why.
1318674407871533056 2020-10-21 06:04:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Pouissant1 It is my understanding that the Happy Days cast has promised to not do a reunion show if WI goes blue.
1318673615290728449 2020-10-21 06:01:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckGrassley @tpdeod32 @realDonaldTrump If Biden wins, how long before there is a huge war in the Middle East?
1318671274701332480 2020-10-21 05:51:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NanaLuvsShoes @bakoff333 The 1.4% Yes all live in NYC and are unemployed.  Their immigration status is questionable.
1318670777210736641 2020-10-21 05:49:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @JRinPueblo @SteveKalayjian @Varneyco Since the plan is to destroy 401(k)s after a Biden win, most people will be barred from participating in the stock market anyway as a few elites (&amp;China) consolidates ownership of America.  A stock market free fall will transfer all our wealth and our life's saving to a few.
1318669951884873728 2020-10-21 05:46:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Hoya97 @BreitbartNews Hey Arizona,  @CaptMarkKelly will be coming to take our guns.  You all know that, like everything else, he is lying about that.
1318669679305523200 2020-10-21 05:45:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Twitter question, can you have more retweets than likes?  I think that they are gaming the system.
1318669454801137664 2020-10-21 05:44:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @iowa_trump @lor65 If this takes Biden out, who is the Democrat nominee and what happens to the Biden votes.  No one wants Harris so where does this leave the Democrats.  I think the plan was to have her as VP before Biden was gone.
1318667490642198528 2020-10-21 05:36:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cajun4trump @ChrisMo37540912 Big smile because I already have voted for Trump, McSally, Biggs, and every red person on the ballot.  I even checked out the judges.  😃
1318667099745611777 2020-10-21 05:35:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 @bbbraner Wwwwwwwhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaattttttttt???????  That is Nevada Dude.  Wow.
1318665827344740352 2020-10-21 05:30:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @hwrdcook @USMCMIL03 @HillaryClinton Yeah, one thing that the Democrats and Republicans can agree on is that they both don't want her in the WH.
1318662308994838528 2020-10-21 05:16:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Hoya97 @gatewaypundit OMG, I hope she does not get so upset she leaves the country.  🤣
1318661877287677952 2020-10-21 05:14:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @chuckwoolery Wow, drugs and booze starting to take their toll on Obama.
1318661587050192896 2020-10-21 05:13:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @w_terrence @DrShayPhD Actually, nobody is running as a Democrat.  Biden is hiden, and no one wants Harris who is also not seen much.  It is not clear if Democrats are voting for anyone in particular or just voting against America and Orange man bad.
1318661133226528768 2020-10-21 05:11:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @roxyloveslucy @Yahoo Hopefully @netflix is doing well enough to cover Obama's massive paycheck.
1318659771809951744 2020-10-21 05:06:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DevinNunes Parler needs to do some work on its user interface and then there would be a stampede.
1318659099786031104 2020-10-21 05:03:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Ralph_F_Mariano @no_silenced @kylegriffin1 Although what you say is true, it is not totally clear if @twitter and @facebook can claim Section 230 immunity since they have ceased to be a neutral platform and have adopted the operation of a publisher / editor.  It likely that election interference is not protected.

1318630464618328065 2020-10-21 03:09:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden What a crock!  "The survey interviewed 1,070 adults nationwide from Oct. 9-12 using both live phone interviews and online polling."  On line polling?  Hahahaha Let the bots rule.  1,070 interviews (forgetting on line) is 20 live per state and territory.  C' Mon man!  Stop the 💩.
1318628894178603008 2020-10-21 03:03:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenSchumer Its October 20th and Joe Biden has not answered one question about ripping off America by selling us out to China, Russia, Ukraine, ect.  Is that simply pay for play or treason?
1318623359345700864 2020-10-21 02:41:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Freedom4all67 @Emmita17E Why don't we liquidate @Google and send every  American a check for $ 1,200?
1318622015012569088 2020-10-21 02:36:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jsolomonReports Now do China.  Then do Russia.

1318534479208574977 2020-10-20 20:48:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @anna12061 Interesting that there will be nine justices to hear arguments when it comes to SCOTUS.
1318532124715069442 2020-10-20 20:38:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NewDayForNJ @webetterbelieve Interesting that to actually get a look at the VP's son, you have to log on to PornHub and click on the under 14 section.  Satire, I don't think PornHub has an under 14 section.
1318529148189437953 2020-10-20 20:27:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WayneDupreeShow @DanetteJHayes Is that FOX on the microphone?
1318525947742617604 2020-10-20 20:14:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @politico So now we know that intelligence people lie to beat the band and want a traitor who sold out the country to its enemies to be president.  Why?
1318370387894226944 2020-10-20 09:56:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit Why?  What do they have on him?  Can't wait for tie breaker to join and make him superfluous  What a piece of shit.  How many people did he screw with Obamacare?

1318333853052792832 2020-10-20 07:30:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CHIZMAGA I have a suggestion as to where she can put the gavel.
1318333426219380737 2020-10-20 07:29:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @123RHGreen @LibertyBell1000 @gatewaypundit So the Biden family took a ton of money from Russia to stop sanctions being put in place.  Wow, we have been sold out to our worst enemies by Biden.  Sadly, the @FBI, MSM, @twitter, @Facebook , the Democrat party, and others are covering up the treason &amp; betrayal.  Why @FBI?
1318327254791847936 2020-10-20 07:04:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto @BattleTerk He might want to subpoena Wray to see why he and the @FBI covered up the whole thing.
1318327088072388610 2020-10-20 07:04:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @idalyssg @Slaughtertrades @realDonaldTrump LOL, I am a bit older and I voted for @realDonaldTrump   He brings us all together.  Hopefully, your world will be saved from the Democrats and what they have planned for America.  Everyone needs to protect the country for our young.
1318325787817250816 2020-10-20 06:58:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MoooPapa These guys are not smart, just have a monopoly and no ethics.
1318325601464250368 2020-10-20 06:58:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenSchumer Actually you are fighting for election fraud because you have Roberts compromised.
1318288074674032641 2020-10-20 04:29:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @hucklebee_sarah @KittyBigSlick So now we have had @FBI - Mueller, Comey, and Wray @TheJusticeDept - Holder, Lynch, Sessions, and Barr.  Every get the feeling that America has been royally screwed?  No wonder China feels it can eat us alive.
1318287407049969665 2020-10-20 04:26:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @baberu @freedmeto @CarySimonds9 @WAGOP Hey @twitter, why is this buried in the click to show section of tweets.
1318287068980678657 2020-10-20 04:25:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @baberu @freedmeto @CarySimonds9 2016, WA was ready for Trump.  See below.  Unfortunately the @WAGOP screwed up and nominated two anti Trump mega losers for Governor and Senator who attacked Trump and destroyed the ticket.   Hopefully, they have not phucked up this time.  https://t.co/rH8heoZZby
1318285934140432384 2020-10-20 04:20:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RedPillMaC This is worth a million retweets.  @CNN called what it is.
1318285483026247682 2020-10-20 04:18:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JonathanTurley @USAHipster Actually, no he shouldn't.  I for one am tired of his lies and do not want another raft of 🐂💩 shoveled my way by him.
1318285104578359296 2020-10-20 04:17:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SBessed @freedmeto Don't judge WA by Seattle and the skummy high tech Microsoft types.  It is a beautiful state with the most wonderful people.  Like CA &amp; OR it is being screwed over by the Democrat / Leftists.
1318283700530900992 2020-10-20 04:11:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Emmita17E @gatewaypundit Simple rule:  Everything the Democrats say is a lie.
1318283382476869633 2020-10-20 04:10:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Sabrina67408695 @LyndaG1963 Which time?  She did it on the first one until she got our money for the Kennedy Center (who then laid off people) and other tons of pork.  She is doing it this time because she wants us to pay for the destruction of CA, NY, IL, etc. by Democrats.  Tired of being blackmailed.
1318282725145538560 2020-10-20 04:07:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Emmita17E @gatewaypundit Isn't this from the Mueller playbook.  Indict Russians who will never appear in court and never say whether the charges are bullshit or not.  Please ignore the rampant Biden crime and sale of America to China and Russia, we got hackers.  What a crock.
1318281599805399040 2020-10-20 04:03:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MarkusaWFreedom @Patrick02236004 @FBI Not sure what you mean.
1318246186671747072 2020-10-20 01:42:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @1776Stonewall I am the #CCP and I approve the Biden tax plan.  Just kidding.  If Biden makes us into Venezuela the money would be meaningless anyway and access to a dumpster would be what really counts.
1318245581462986752 2020-10-20 01:40:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JewhadiTM @debates @AP Trump should pull out.

1318228841584734212 2020-10-20 00:33:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tyler_casper As I read this.
1318228784785412096 2020-10-20 00:33:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Patrick02236004 So the @FBI has upped it a notch and is now covering crimes committed by the elite Democrats by threatening regular citizens.  Wray needs to go and the @FBI either cleaned out from top to bottom or eliminated entirely.  This type of thing is really bad.
1318219662149046272 2020-10-19 23:57:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sayitnspinit That reminds me, I've run out of lard for my cooking.

1318199585202843649 2020-10-19 22:37:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 I think that after 11/03, Section 230 needs to be revisited.  I wonder if Twitter has a Plan B.

1317972189165932549 2020-10-19 07:33:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @disclosetv @BeanK511 How many of the Antifa thugs work for @twitter and @facebook?
1317971382731329537 2020-10-19 07:30:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Rasmussen_Poll @KingsFull89 Wray and that agent as well as most of the @FBI need be fired.  They were clearly and purposely hiding evidence of criminal activity so that Biden would not be prosecuted.  Hey Barr, you are the boss of the FBI, what say you?  Something needs be done, Someting big.
1317969708046430209 2020-10-19 07:23:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Farberyanki @LABeachGal1 Yeah, well Joe would have done it better.  It is true, it says it on his teleprompter.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1317969024433614848 2020-10-19 07:21:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 @bbbraner Good point.  Hey @CaptMarkKelly .  We know you hate the police and are lying about wanting to take our guns among many other things.  But does Mark Kellly who wants to be Senator from Arizona disavow Joe Biden for corruption and his long record of overt criminality?  Let us know.
1317965801203191809 2020-10-19 07:08:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bryan700 If it is the @FBI, the guy is likely working to bury the proof of Biden's abuse of children.

Arizona and the Country will be much better off with your defeat.  Then you can hate the cops and plot to take our guns to your hearts content.  https://t.co/xWXOmMOWZu
1317964561127940096 2020-10-19 07:03:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @basili_debra @CaliRN619 @realDonaldTrump I think that 11/04 would be a good day to clean out the @FBI and @TheJusticeDept .  Starting at the top and working down to the lowest reaches.
1317963969949102080 2020-10-19 07:01:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GTolbert9 It is simple, the elites, MSM, tech leaders, and Dem bosses will all dine well while you fight to eat their garbage.  Think carefully before you vote and look closely at Venezuela and Cuba.  10,000,000 people starved to death in China within ten years of the commie takeover.
1317963038318718976 2020-10-19 06:57:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Robertl01464344 @BeanK511 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @TeamTrump @TrumpWarRoom @GOPChairwoman @MailOnline Gosh, have you ever seen any group as dirty as the Bidens.  And good old Joe is the Democrats pick to run the country.  Our well being, our future, our children will be Joes.  It seems everyone has evidence of the Biden's criminal acts and is moving on it except for the @FBI.
1317961988056645632 2020-10-19 06:53:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TrumpWarRoom @PlaysTrumpCard Isn't @CaptMarkKelly  who is running in Arizona of the same ilk only a lot smaller right now.  He has extensive financial ties with China and just bilked the AZ taxpayers out of $ 15,000,000.  He promised to create jobs in our state &amp; the second the check cleared laid people off.

1317909557289447424 2020-10-19 03:24:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HLAurora63 @bbbraner Satan would disagree with your conclusion.
1317909244142780416 2020-10-19 03:23:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Timcast Hahahahaha.  It gets to the point that you don't even have to prove that they are moron.  It is so obvious.
1317909033869701121 2020-10-19 03:22:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gregkellyusa @momrockzz Hey, Bloomberg and Soros and the other NWO billionaires have plenty of money to throw away.  It is not they are suffering like the rest of the country.  We get the same thing here in Arizona, incessant, never ending, mind eroding @CaptMarkKelly and Biden lie ads.  MAKE THEM STOP!
1317907890699603969 2020-10-19 03:18:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sailorJack2019 @kimbers671 @CindyProUSA @FloridaDude297 @TwitchyTeam Maybe Biden's diminished capacity is a blessing as his and his criminal family's evil past unravels.  He is probably sitting in his basement right now, playing with his navel, and wondering what the uproar is about.
1317906738754973696 2020-10-19 03:13:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CedaRita @catchingfireCA Wonderful.  This Arizona guy and family could not be there, but we all voted Trump, McSally, Biggs, and red all the way down the line.  We love our state.
1317905950817222656 2020-10-19 03:10:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kimKBaltimore It is really sad to see those good people and many others around the country being defrauded out of their lives and futures by Democrat Election Fraud.

1317904139557371904 2020-10-19 03:03:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lions_us @vabelle2010 @realDonaldTrump One big help to coming back to where were were is vote red down the line.  Much of our problems have been caused less by the Chinese Plague and more by the Democrat one which has closed down states and denied help to Americans blackmailing us for our aid.
1317903447841067008 2020-10-19 03:00:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dannoyes @TheRISEofROD This is what the Democrats will bring to every city and export to the suburbs.  There will be nowhere to hide from sucker punching leftist thugs.  Notice the police did nothing to stop the attack, yet would have arrested anyone that shot the thug.
1317902776219836418 2020-10-19 02:58:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EveryoneIn_LA Who pays the rent? Who pays the mortgage? Who pays the real estate tax? Who pays for upkeep on rental property? Who pays for liability insurance.  Who will build desperately needed new housing in CA if they can't collect rent? Who will loan to home buyers if mortgages not paid.
1317901978408677376 2020-10-19 02:54:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @atensnut I can't blame him.  China, Russia, etc. paid him a lot more than he was paid by the US as VP.
1317901497229664256 2020-10-19 02:52:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jsolomonReports @Nth_Dimensions That is likely a Federal Crime.  It would be nice if we had a @TheJusticeDept .
1317901072963305472 2020-10-19 02:51:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @daverich503 @ckkirsch1 @realDonaldTrump I think that on 11/04, most of the @FBI and @TheJusticeDept needs to be given pink slips.  And when they are gone, the @CIA and State Department should follow.  America has been betrayed on the most basic levels to the benefit of foreign adversaries by our own government.

1317899668597043200 2020-10-19 02:45:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mauricetoic WTF, the Democrats are in your face election fraud.
1317899227536658432 2020-10-19 02:43:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @magajcs No kidding.  Two losers.  This is the best of @FoxNews a few weeks before the election.  I guess everyone in the Biden campaign is hiding until they can come up with a big enough lie about the Hunter laptop.
1317882702142435328 2020-10-19 01:38:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AngryChinaGirl @gatewaypundit @MailOnline Wait until you see what he and Biden has planned for America, you and me.

1317871280868085761 2020-10-19 00:52:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @OANN Since when does a brain addled alcohol soaked member of the house give the President an ultimatum?  She is holding the American People hostage while she sits and gobbles down ice cream that those same people cannot afford.
1317840270826770432 2020-10-18 22:49:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TeamSaveAmerica @debaroo54 It is soon coming that you will need to be seriously armed to walk the streets of America.  Hey Joe, he is a Trump supporter.  What color is he?
1317839792357306368 2020-10-18 22:47:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit @robdetf LOL, true?  If so, another wonderous adventure brought to you by the @FBI.  Is there an incompentcy test to join up?  At least there were no guns to Mexican Cartels involved in this op.

1317801998196985858 2020-10-18 20:17:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BarnettforAZ Hey Arizona, do you know who is a leader in Antifa and took part in the sacking of Minneapolis, the burning, looting, and attacks on defenseless people?  Hint, she is being hugged by Giffords and @CaptMarkKelly is hugging her election fraud mommy.  https://t.co/fjBqhfd7o3
1317795703981142018 2020-10-18 19:52:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DonaldJTrumpJr @CaptMarkKelly is the run of the mill lying profiteering Democrat.  He won't take our guns. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Hint: Married her brother, slept with someone while married to not brother, anti christian, anti Semitic, anti American.

1317551812476428288 2020-10-18 03:43:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Question for the @DNC.  Now that Biden has been outed as someone who is a Chinese agent who sells it on the side to Russia and other enemies of America, how can you run him for President of the United States?  Your prompt answer will be appreciated.
1317551139206787072 2020-10-18 03:40:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @wendyp4545 I would not be to hurt, Biden likely read that from a teleprompter and does not remember what Michigan is.

1317547788691927040 2020-10-18 03:27:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TheZogbyPoll @rider_of_Dstorm Already voted for Trump.
1317547409472278528 2020-10-18 03:25:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SomeBitchIKnow @flatwalk WTF?  I have never seen any issue with people of India heritage.
1317546699443691520 2020-10-18 03:23:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump Compromised or owned?
1317546461073080320 2020-10-18 03:22:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackySinAZ @MarthaMcSally @CaptMarkKelly PS - Why is Bloomberg dropping Millions and Millions into our state from the gleaming epidemy of leftist failure, NYC, to pollute our airwaves with the Kelly lie ads.  You can't escape the ads, it is something like out of a bad science fiction movie.
1317545431266586624 2020-10-18 03:18:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SCRCali68 @MarthaMcSally Stay in Cali, we have seen what a great job your lies and 🐂💩 have done for that once great state.  Does @CaptMarkKelly share Biden's Chinese contacts in his business dealings?  Just asking.  Just voted for McSally and don't want to live in a Marxist Antifa / BLM 💩 hole.
1317544418321158145 2020-10-18 03:14:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackySinAZ @MarthaMcSally My family went pure red and it was a pleasue to vote for you and OUR PRESIDENT Trump.  @CaptMarkKelly is lying to Arizona.  Our guns, our police, and our freedoms are at risk with him and his ilk.  One picture is worth 1,000 tweets so here is what Kelly is.  https://t.co/oSjszGJxxR
1317543437873213440 2020-10-18 03:10:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @brhodes Moron, countries with fascist autocrats don't get any chance to vote them out, China, Russia, Cuba, Venezuela, ......  You guys (leftist a$$wipes) just spew the 💩 without regard to truth, sense, or meaning as long as it suits your purpose.  Besides Obama + Deep State came close.
1317522824811081728 2020-10-18 01:48:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SteveGuest @ckolacia @realDonaldTrump More impressive is the audience reaction to Biden.  Most look blankly bored and on the left near the end one woman is leaning away like don't come near me and a kid is yawning to beat the band.
1317520336661798917 2020-10-18 01:38:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TheRightMelissa @Believe_N_USA One common strain that goes through Trump backers, they are a happy group.
1317520087402782720 2020-10-18 01:37:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BirdingTrip @CaliforniaGlobe So in California it is now illegal to sing the national anthem.  Sounds about right of the Pelosi criminal cartel.

1317508496418484228 2020-10-18 00:51:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @rswcatlover @RealMattCouch He leans more to Antifa.  Here is his wife (and him) embracing an Antifa activist who participated in the burning, looting, and destruction of her city.  Think they have plans for Phoenix?  https://t.co/i73OaUwvaT
1317507845445726208 2020-10-18 00:48:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealMattCouch According to the @CaptMarkKelly Campaign, they never intended to let the fact that they think of police as "Worthless F@&amp;#ing Pigs" get out.  So sorry.  The also say that, wink wink, sure they won't come and take your guns.  Kelly assures us that he will represent Arizona values.  https://t.co/BLmQnRNqQs
1317506365846245377 2020-10-18 00:42:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @currie14_kelly @Jinger_Ellie @JoeBiden I guess the take away from this is that Joes mind may be gone, but his vision is still ok.  That telepromter with his spontaneous remarks was pretty far away.
1317505997808627713 2020-10-18 00:41:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Lrihendry I think when the videos come out we will find that Hunter violated a lot of things and should be arrested for most of them.
1317505415609946112 2020-10-18 00:39:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HoneyFitz93 Funny how the @FBI is helping the Marxist Democrats take their country away.  No, not funny at all.
1317504866562961413 2020-10-18 00:36:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ksorbs Hey America, blow it out your a$$.  Signed The untouchable, what are you going to do about it, deep state, #CCP enabler, Democrat protector, @FBI
1317504024245989376 2020-10-18 00:33:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 @DebbyAJ I think that Hunter will take your advice and get rid of the laptop.
1317503580379574274 2020-10-18 00:31:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CBSNews Just like Joe at a Biden rally.
1317503461290696704 2020-10-18 00:31:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto Yes, but he has to wait until 11/04 to avoid a screaming controversy that is not needed for three weeks.  Wray is corrupt and a criminal in the mold of Mueller and Comey.  His holding back information to protect someone who is little more than a agent of China is treason.
1317476716625809408 2020-10-17 22:45:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JohnStossel Bettors are not saying Biden is likely to win.  The biggest game in the world, the stock market, would have dropped to 8,000 if the bettors there thought that Biden will win.
1317475847641600000 2020-10-17 22:41:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Herbert_L_Reed @BIZPACReview Does Wray's boss, Bill Barr have any comment?

1317439991853711362 2020-10-17 20:19:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @USMCMIL03 @CaptMarkKelly bilked the Arizona Tax Payers out of $15,000,000 by promising jobs and when the check cleared immediately laid off employees.  That is the type of person he is.  He now is lying about two very important Arizona issues, guns &amp; police.  AZ, can you trust this man.  https://t.co/M7RBgecqaE
1317437060983123971 2020-10-17 20:07:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Variety @WingsofCrystal @Twitter So @twitter was LYING about its new policies.  Surprise, surprise, surprise.  Why is Twitter so hell bent on getting an obvious treasonous criminal owned by the #CCP into the WH?  What is in it for Twitter or actually the twitter execs?

1317427375970267137 2020-10-17 19:28:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @paulsperry_ Inbred perverted swamp bugs.  The MSM + Democrat left.
1317425631907336193 2020-10-17 19:22:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HeatherIAm23 After Wray is gone and the @FBI is cleaned up and honest people who care about the country and will actually honor their oath are brought in, yes.  Of course @TheJusticeDept will need to have it's deep corruption removed as well.
1317301854548627456 2020-10-17 11:10:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TX_WalkerRanger Not as a Democrat.
1317284984575553536 2020-10-17 10:03:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dawg_lb @CorneredCRRJA5 If true - UH OH.
1317283950436339712 2020-10-17 09:59:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sethjlevy @rentonMagaUK Biden did not fall over while walking to the potty in his basement.  That counts for something.

1317262438060892160 2020-10-17 08:33:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AP I will believe it when I see it.  Like they could not have gone there when they had the lap top in their possession.

He is lying to us and trying to talk us into giving up our &amp; our families safety &amp; security.  Remember, if he is elected Arizona is stuck with him.

1317260476279975942 2020-10-17 08:25:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ImNoSaint1 Basically Biden is engaged in the foulest of treason.  And it is not just China, who may be our biggest threat, but also Russia and God only knows who else he is selling us out to.

The picture of his wife with her arm around a Minnesota Antifa thug who participated in he riots is a dead give away of the truth.  https://t.co/1k7rWiGXZY

1317246002387062785 2020-10-17 07:28:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenKamalaHarris Not true.  As a matter of fact Felicia has a better chance of survival than the average resident in a NYS assisted care facility.

1317245045494353920 2020-10-17 07:24:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DeanBrowningPA Can you believe that @twitter, @Facebook, @google, and the usual list of suspects as well as most of the MSM would help the Democrats put an employee of the #CCP in the Oval Office?
1317244544014897152 2020-10-17 07:22:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EricTrump @ronmolina After a side discussion @Disney was promised that the @FBI would not look into its "children" friends if Biden is elected.  So @ABC, fit to be the network of a third world dictator, followed orders from its parent.  Just kidding.

Look at Biden and ask yourself, do I want a career criminal who has sold out America (and you) to its enemies, China, Russia, ..., etc.  Then ask yourself if you believe @CaptMarkKelly s lies that he is ramming down our throats with millions of ad dollars?
1317186373577629696 2020-10-17 03:31:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kimfreethinker @JoeBiden HIGH TREASON!!!  Why does @twitter want Biden to be president?
1317185668661956613 2020-10-17 03:28:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kimfreethinker @JoeBiden This makes one ask @twitter why they are suppressing the truth and  protecting a man who appears to be a criminal who has many times sold out the USA to its enemies.  A man who has run a criminal empire out of his office.  Why does twitter want this man to be president?

1317130832499286022 2020-10-16 23:50:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @YaUsedToKnow Just how does bailing out violent felons and putting them back on the streets to again attack people and property end the chaos?  You did that.
1317130382509133825 2020-10-16 23:48:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BreitbartNews Hollywood and the Entertainment industry said that they would leave the United States if Trump won in 2016.  Promises made. Promises not kept.
1317119183834935296 2020-10-16 23:04:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Wow, real adobe.
1317118442554576896 2020-10-16 23:01:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lisaturnerdecor So let me make sure that I am reading this right.  @SpeakerPelosi , a key Democrat leader, would rather phuck over Americans in desparate need than do something that could be perceived as a political advantage to Trump who is working to help those Americans.  Am I understanding?
1317117394012176385 2020-10-16 22:57:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Hahahahaha  No worry, Joe already sold their private data to China.

1317110009939984384 2020-10-16 22:27:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> I apologize for the misspellings.  I was much pissed over the never ending stream of lies.
1317109279464198144 2020-10-16 22:24:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> And please stop with the ad bombardment.  I already rejected you and embraced McSally and voted for her.  So give us poor people of Arizona some peace and save your money people, whoever they are, some cash and stop.
1317109278583316480 2020-10-16 22:24:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> ... to tell us about your dealing with China &amp; how much you are making off of them.  Are you selling us out too and what will you do if elected.  Oh year, what is it with your staff &amp; police hate?  In the end it is a question of who do I believe @CaptMarkKelly or my lying eyes.
1317108082745307137 2020-10-16 22:20:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> We all know that you bilked the State of Arizona and tax payers out of $ 15,000,000 promising jobs and the minute the check cleared, you fired people.  And China.  Biden is being exposed as having taken a great deal of money to sell us out; our security and jobs.  Do you want....
1317108081973624833 2020-10-16 22:20:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> We all know that you are a @SenSchumer suck up and are lying about fighting the corrupt DC policians.  You have endorsed and have your arm around one of the most corrupt to hit DC.  We all know that you are lying about taking our guns.  Look at the @Project_Veritas video.
1317108080757272576 2020-10-16 22:20:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> To @CaptMarkKelly , for the love of God please stop running your incessent every present can't get away form them all lie ads.  I have stopped watching the moringing news because of you.  Who is paying for this insane blitz.  As far as you fighting for Arizona values, I submit:  https://t.co/MsJltlGSOQ

1317082653552603137 2020-10-16 20:39:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AbodeJustice You bet.  America is being treasonously sold to our enemies by the Democrats and the @FBI is covering it up.  @TheJusticeDept is as well.  In the end, if elected President, Biden will be in a position to do us all great harm.

They would have you elect someone who will sell us out to foreign interests for personal gain  The @FBI has not acted on information of a Presidential Candidate who took money from enemies, China &amp; Russia.
1317080745412685824 2020-10-16 20:31:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kathi_4t @MJKHogs @BreitbartNews @twitters 3/3  The @nypost article shows in some detail what I consider criminal behavior and TREASON.  Yet @twitter expended great effort to keep this from America.  Simply, twitter is working to get a person who could be a treasonous influence peddler elected President.  Hard to take.
1317079942828486658 2020-10-16 20:28:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kathi_4t @MJKHogs @BreitbartNews @twitters Most believe that Biden is a crook.  That he is corrupt and has used his office to peddle influence to the harm of America and the American people.  The people America has been sold to (sometimes using our tax dollars) are at the least, corrupt Ukraine Officials, China, &amp; Russia.
1317079348801753090 2020-10-16 20:26:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kathi_4t @MJKHogs @BreitbartNews 1/3  We have heard that @twitters actions was an assualt on the constitutiona and the 1st Amendment. We have heard that @twitters actions constitute election interference.  Both statements are true.  But here is what has not been touched on and what bothers me greatly.
1317060481211801600 2020-10-16 19:11:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 Barrett will quiet down after shtis confirmed but the Biden criminality is just beginning.

1317055612404985856 2020-10-16 18:51:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> LOL  Funny when you log in each morning to see what #Twitter had done to attack America, the American people, the constitution, freedom of speech, and to protect senile criminal Joe and push Democrat lies.  Hopefully 11/04 will be the beginning of deserved pay back.
1317052872484245504 2020-10-16 18:40:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marklevinshow @willbarrett_1 On Nov 4th we will see if twitter has a plan B to save itself   Twitter is tied to the sinking ship Biden .  As is Facebook.
1316837819520700417 2020-10-16 04:26:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @petefrt I have @OANN where I get honest and complete news.
1316837377046802432 2020-10-16 04:24:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FiveRights @MARILYN19556 Is graft taxable income?  Asking for a friend that wants to be a CPA.  Anyway, thank goodness the IRS is part of the Deep State and protects Democrats.
1316836064376442880 2020-10-16 04:19:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @reubing Chris Wallace is an a@@hole.  If he says someone is honorable, hide your valuables.
1316835074227093504 2020-10-16 04:15:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mamabridgee Nope, I am attracted to women too.  Yes, I am male.
1316834711184973824 2020-10-16 04:13:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @miles_commodore Is it true that they are going to bus the impartial audience over from the local chapter of the @DNC?
1316834447589732354 2020-10-16 04:12:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 So the debate committee picked someone to host a presidential debate who was fired for lying.  Gives me a lot of confidence in those a$$holes.  It looks like every jerk in the world is working for gov't or the Democrats.
1316833898345586689 2020-10-16 04:10:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joshdcaplan I wonder how long before he ends up in one of three different places.  1 Biden Campaign 2 NYTimes 3 Twitter fact checker.
1316816386476261376 2020-10-16 03:01:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MSNBC @NBCNews Bull 🐂 Shit 💩 .
1316816100785446912 2020-10-16 02:59:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PressSec @Anzers Good to see you back.  I would say, that after Nov 3rd when Trump 45 takes action, he has my full support.  The only reason Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc. exist is Section 230 protection.  Time to challenge the Social Medias claims of coverage and time to end it.
1316798318601670657 2020-10-16 01:49:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit @PRheydt @SenTedCruz @Twitter I think an @FBI raid on @twitter headquarters and the homes of executives is warranted at this point.
1316797702869381121 2020-10-16 01:46:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LLinWood @ResidentOfFL You have @OANN, @newsmax , radio, blogs, and millions on social media.  The result will be will be as in the Post articles which was to bring them to more people with more force after stirring much interest.
1316796142630268928 2020-10-16 01:40:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dcexaminer @SAndricsak No they won't.  They will move back overseas.
1316795237251989504 2020-10-16 01:37:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto @LDiamond39 Ever think that the Chinese Energy firm was impressed by the great work he did in the Ukraine.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1316794543224713216 2020-10-16 01:34:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BillKristol @FLConserve941 🐂💩  39% are not going to view Biden.  He will be lucky if a few people tune in to help them nod off.  I do concede that some will watch to see how many gaffs he makes while reading the answers to prewritten questions from the teleprompter or see if he knows which state he is in
1316793706100322307 2020-10-16 01:30:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sioxielegend @tedcruz @Twitter @nypost Or both.
1316793395172397057 2020-10-16 01:29:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JaneyLynn002 @dcthorpe @FoxNews Let's lift Section 230 protections which almost all private companies do not have and see how long they stay in business.  That is a BS arguement.
1316783591024553984 2020-10-16 00:50:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SaraCarterDC It may warrant a full federal criminal probe, but have you looked at the @FBI &amp; @TheJusticeDept lately.
1316782590074871813 2020-10-16 00:46:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Charles_Lister @QellyAnon What is going to happen to the mail in ballots the @DNC sent them?
1316781780452560896 2020-10-16 00:43:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @American1299 LOL, if the Bidens are not morons no one is.  The invoice was for $ 85..  All this because they were to lazy to pick up the computer and pay the $ 85 thereby forfeiting ownership.  If the Post did not hack, @twitter is in deep doo doo, because they are open to charges &amp; lawsuit.
1316780842736209921 2020-10-16 00:39:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @American1299 Uh, uh, uh twitter.  Does Section 230 protect against election interference?  Will Section 230 protect you against law suit if it can be established that you acted as a publisher / editer and not a neutral platform.  Enjoy your testimony Tuesday.
1316780344767471617 2020-10-16 00:37:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joshdcaplan @missnormagene I think that it will be great to have the Democrats vote against Amy Coney Barrett based on nothing but their agenda.  Especially good to see those running for office show how scummy they are.
1316780047437504512 2020-10-16 00:36:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DavidNakamura Varney likely agrees.  He like many on Fox Business are stand up Americans.  Those that came here to be Americans for far away are loyal and love the Country.
1316779584113635328 2020-10-16 00:34:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Ilhan @CaptMarkKelly Oops forgot to attach.  The Kellys are embracing Omar and her Antifa certified daughter after endorsing her.  I guess that was before the @Project_Veritas Omar election fraud videos, not that they would have made a difference to Kelly.  https://t.co/9lliwgaezM
1316779064028348417 2020-10-16 00:32:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kandibar2011 @ConservVoice The Democrats are not running a campaign.  No one is voting for Biden and less than no one want Harris.  The Dems are running a two pronged effort.  1 Attack Trump with every lie that you can muster and flood media with millions + millions is BS ads. 2 Election Fraud.
1316778450011578368 2020-10-16 00:30:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Ilhan Hey, just how close are you and @CaptMarkKelly who is running on a bushel of lies for Senator in Arizona?  PS - Tell your buddy Mark that I &amp; my entire family voted for McSally.  The people of Minnesota did not need to have their homes &amp; businesses burned down by your Antifa mobs
1316777397652385792 2020-10-16 00:26:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MandyyLane @InGodIDoTrust @captcrunch32 @FBI One presumes that destroy the laptop in that context means destroy the drives and make any data they held unable to be accessed / gone.
1316776813243199489 2020-10-16 00:23:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AmericanAnth @InGodIDoTrust @captcrunch32 @FBI Got carried away.  Indeed, clean them out, disinfect them, and find honest people to replace them.
1316776585152798722 2020-10-16 00:22:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AmericanAnth @InGodIDoTrust @captcrunch32 @FBI I think that the biggest thing we all found out is how dirty DC is.  The agencies have always been bad, but Obama brought their criminality, contempt for America &amp; the American people, &amp; distain for the Constitution to new heights.  No wonder they fearlessly engaged in treason.
1316766380549578752 2020-10-15 23:42:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bvoice_p @scott_helmick @tedcruz By the time this is over, @twitter will have spread Joe's criminal behavior far and wide and dragged itself into the morass.  There are also land mines there for the Dems running for the Senate.
1316765961312071688 2020-10-15 23:40:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bvoice_p @scott_helmick @tedcruz Hit the road Jack.  Jack is in a bad place.  If he again lies under oath and Biden is not elected he will have to face an angry Trump 45 v2.0 with the American people pissed as all get out.  If he tells the truth, it is the end.  If you were Jack, what would you do?
1316765136405721088 2020-10-15 23:37:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Tony19542 @RG4540 Nah, nobody wants Harris, Democrat or Republican or Independent.  The only way for the Elites to get her into that office is to get Joe elected and then be gone in a few months.  It is a sweetheart deal for Joe because they would make his / families crimes go away.
1316749808216932352 2020-10-15 22:36:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Since Halloween is coming I will bring up a possibility that will scare your socks off.  1 Biden wins 2 Biden lasts 3 months as President 3 Harris becomes President 4 @IlhanMN is appointed VP  We end up by April with an Executive Branch run by Harris / Omar.  And then this in AZ.  https://t.co/GfSaLSu0TV
1316732107956187138 2020-10-15 21:26:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @D_Alex_connect No, not tarnished, rather trashed.  Time to get rid of the @FBI and start over with an honest agency that will employ people who love the country and take their oath under the constitution seriously.  The Bidens sold America out to China &amp; the @FBI sat on it &amp; did nothing.  Sad.
1316731209695727616 2020-10-15 21:22:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Sam2323_43433 @KidukSong Hey, isn't that the news article that twitter and facebook are trying to keep the American people from seeing?
1316723555388678144 2020-10-15 20:52:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @IAmTheActualET @kerpen IDK.  If the Democrats Election Fraud their way to victory, the stock market will plunge and everyone, investor and 401k holder, will be badly hurt.
1316723283346157575 2020-10-15 20:51:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kerpen @yoakumgirl923 Wow.
1316722885726146561 2020-10-15 20:49:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lisamcat @EversFam @JudiciaryGOP @nypost Uh oh, @twitter is going to ban the President.
1316722576857522177 2020-10-15 20:48:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PaulaJo41820905 @Lonestar2003 @DGPurser LOL, she can make @IlhanMN VP of the US after Biden is gone.  Wouldn't that be a trip?  Democrat victory in Nov. is end of US.
1316722200678866944 2020-10-15 20:46:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Elainie @Kathyvalmate @InGodIDoTrust @captcrunch32 @FBI It will be interesting to see if the number of people saying that are correct.  I admit to bias and after the last 3.5 years tend to believe most negative about the @FBI.  My experience is that the vast majority of times, statements about FBI malfeasance have been true.
1316720908413751296 2020-10-15 20:41:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Lonestar2003 @DGPurser Right and then we get Harris.
1316720796765622273 2020-10-15 20:41:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DGPurser Yes.  And a perv too.
1316712978817773571 2020-10-15 20:10:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Jackk_Burton @RealJamesWoods Maybe the @nypost should do some investigative reporting and take a good look at @twitter.
1316712470380081154 2020-10-15 20:08:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods @4allusapatroits Done by a number of peolple and being retweeted as I speak.
1316710971818176512 2020-10-15 20:02:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DeniseB28480321 @Sarah25540235 @BrendaRubin74 @RealJamesWoods Please don't retweet.  🤣
1316709686230437888 2020-10-15 19:57:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced PS - I believe that twitter is incorporated in Delaware.  Sound familiar?  What POS can you name controls a good part of Delaware?  Will the AG of Delaware take a look at twitter?  What do you think?
1316708829933961217 2020-10-15 19:53:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced Truth, If NYS can attack Trump for nothing, why can't red states look at twitter and facebook for real crimes?
1316707331527241729 2020-10-15 19:47:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @InGodIDoTrust @captcrunch32 WHY DID THE @FBI AGENTS DESTROY HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP WHICH CONTAINED EVIDENCE OF CRIMES?  Done shouting.  Is there a more criminally corrupt orginization (other than the Clinton Foundation) in the US than the FBI?  Time to get rid of it and replace with an honest agency.
1316706006596907009 2020-10-15 19:42:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal @nypost It was a big boo boo.  So will @twitter unblock the Post article?  Three different approches to twitter.  1 Legislate Section 230 out of existance. 2 Court ruling that twitter is a publisher &amp; not entitled to protection, 3 Antitrust and other actions.  All mean pay for boo boos.
1316559925636526081 2020-10-15 10:02:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DrShayPhD Well said.
1316542311602384896 2020-10-15 08:52:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HyltonRobin @JoeBiden Watch out House Judiciary Committee Republicans, you can be banned for telling the truth.
1316541679101382656 2020-10-15 08:49:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Hoya97 @gatewaypundit So what next, is twitter going to ban the Senate?
1316540711597088768 2020-10-15 08:45:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Mikegoff5 @ConservVoice Told you he would plead stupidity and accident.
1316540344352169985 2020-10-15 08:44:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenWarren It is likely that the rampant and immense Democrat Election Fraud will fall in the domain of the Supreme Court to sort out.  She can't make a statement about your criminal actions because she may have to judge the situation.
1316539562290634752 2020-10-15 08:41:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SohrabAhmari Could Facebook and Twitter have done more to bring this story of Biden's criminality to the attention of every person in America (actually the world)?  How many people will be tracking down the article to see what the social media platfors is keeping from them?
1316538396500615168 2020-10-15 08:36:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @drefanzor @dejean76 LOL, anyone who does not dump their shares tomorrow deserves what they get.
1316538001946673152 2020-10-15 08:34:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @seanmdav If this is fact, then @twitter &amp; @facebook cannot claim Section 230 protection because they are not in the protected class as publisher / editors.  Ironic, the determination if the platforms are subject to legal action may be decided by SCOTUS.
1316537207876853760 2020-10-15 08:31:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SpeakerPelosi Have a drink or 15 and chill out.
1316537092109787137 2020-10-15 08:31:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec @VermontAttorney If Trump tweets a link to the article will @twitter ban him?
1316536571466674176 2020-10-15 08:29:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RyanAFournier My suggestion is go directly to the New York Post web site or find the article in other places.  @twitter can't stop you from doing that and you will see with your own eyes what they are trying to hide.  Then you can ask yourself, why is twitter and @facebook trying to cover up.
1316517480274128896 2020-10-15 07:13:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RepMattGaetz @wmmII88 I think that is true but we need a new @TheJusticeDept that is not leftist deep state first.
1316483299318013954 2020-10-15 04:57:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods WTF?   https://t.co/oO7SpI8m0W
1316477352671502336 2020-10-15 04:33:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EvanAKilgore He is an idiot.
1316470641751519237 2020-10-15 04:07:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TomCottonAR @PMgeezer LOL, bet you a quarter that @twitter issues a statement that it was a techincal glitch and not done by them.
1316470064820830208 2020-10-15 04:04:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SohrabAhmari Think you should sue @twitter which is acting as a editor, a campaign support for Biden, and a communication hub for Antifa and BLM?  Let's see how strong the 230 protection is if you are not a neutral platform.
1316468401506721792 2020-10-15 03:58:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JudyDeRose2 @helpmerhonda49 I think he need to clean out the entire rats nest and then decide whether it is even worth rebuilding.
1316468225199140864 2020-10-15 03:57:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CNBC @TenNamesLater Wait a moment.  If @Facebook is making editorial decisions, then they are not entitled to Section 230 protection and can be sued to heck and back and sued again.  Sounds like a good idea to me.  Wonder if the Supreme Court (🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣) will have to decide Facebook's fate.
1316466577756176384 2020-10-15 03:51:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Jennyjen010 @ConservVoice Take Google for example.  Google makes billions selling China software to spy on its people, military grade softwear it denies to the US, and has other irons in the fire.  They hurt America, sell us out.  Trump would stop them.  Biden would take more money form China.  East.

1316433748372516865 2020-10-15 01:40:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DGPurser @Sthomp13 Durban is up for reelection. It is a dead heat.  This is Illinois and America's chance to get rid of the turkey.  Here is hoping.
1316392412218941440 2020-10-14 22:56:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @nascarred14 @scott_helmick Biden wants Cuomo as AG.  Next thing is the NYPD wearing SS armbands as they roust the Jews.

1316391403518189569 2020-10-14 22:52:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @1776Stonewall @lisaturnerdecor Biden issued an announcement saying, Jerry Harris is a pedo rapist and I approve his message.  Hard to believe that the home of Obama has pedophiles and rapists running around making big bucks.
1316390807897743362 2020-10-14 22:50:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 Get out and vote.  You can de Durbanate Illinois.  America would be better, the world would be better, and you would be better if Illinois had its Durban removed.

1316384361839616000 2020-10-14 22:24:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DeplorableSunny @BirdingTrip Simple, it would never come to pass.  Soon after the election Sullivan will retire, get numerous awards from leftist think tanks and orginizations, get a book deal, and either go to work for a DC Marxist law firm or @NetFlix where his rewards will be laundered directly to him.
1316383432386117632 2020-10-14 22:20:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MemeWiggins Thank you.  I would have thought that the question of trading sexual favors for advancement would more properly come from our future President, Harris.
1316366284498432000 2020-10-14 21:12:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EricMMatheny @buds1008 Was the Senator that asked her if she ever engaged in sexual favors Kamala Harris?  Asking for a friend.
1316365254754856960 2020-10-14 21:08:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @heatherjones333 Be more respectful.  If Biden wins, you are talking about YOUR PRESIDENT.
1316365022835044352 2020-10-14 21:07:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bchapman151 Has Joe picked out a room for him at the WH?  One can see why the Chinese trusted Hunter to invest $1,500,000,000 of the country's money.
1316364424039419904 2020-10-14 21:05:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RonaldBruceBar3 In an alcoholic rage, they eat their young.
1316364092890738689 2020-10-14 21:03:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Patrici15767099 Nothing to fret about, Harris will be president a few months after Biden is sworn in.
1316363509333024768 2020-10-14 21:01:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal The choice is yours.

1316349115622584322 2020-10-14 20:04:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @charliekirk11 She is the Democrat nominee for President.  Biden won't make it more than a few months.  Dem elites pulled a fast one on the faithful sheeple who hate her.
1316347960813215745 2020-10-14 19:59:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GreggJarrett Not true, some will be out and about running for president.

1316346371666968576 2020-10-14 19:53:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @charliekirk11 It would be bad if anyone listened to it
1316346154406170624 2020-10-14 19:52:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 Yesssssssss
1316343586057711619 2020-10-14 19:42:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @STOPTHiS @drdavidsamadi Yeah, the "fair share" was neither fair, fine for not being able to afford skyrocketed premiums, and nor did you get a share of anything.  It took food off the table of the working poor and many older Americans.  Obamacare in this of many ways hurt a lot of people.
1316340291968745476 2020-10-14 19:29:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @drdavidsamadi Very badly.
1316339897490235396 2020-10-14 19:27:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenSchumer Why so Democrats can coup by election fraud?
1316159688715587587 2020-10-14 07:31:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @nypost If Biden is elected, Cuomo could be the first mass murderer appointed AG.
1316159340651319296 2020-10-14 07:30:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DailyCaller Uh oh, @SenFeinstein has a letter.

1316156850799177728 2020-10-14 07:20:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kylie_oneil75 @gatewaypundit @SpeakerPelosi is bat shit crazy.  Give a listen.  Trump and Pence stand between her and the presidency.    We cannot have a Democrat majority in the House again.  Please, please, please vote against every Democrat running for office.  All our lives depend on it.
1316130152800165888 2020-10-14 05:34:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 @kimbers671 Baltimore has a chance.  If not taken its pain is of it's own making.
1316129500644556801 2020-10-14 05:31:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EricTrump WTF?  Is she insane?
1316128898334121984 2020-10-14 05:29:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 @kimbers671 If that is the case, why does she have to cheat?  I wonder how much of her lead is actually people afraid to tell how they feel .
1316127651333988352 2020-10-14 05:24:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenWarren She was confirmed in for appeals court years ago.  She was known for a long while to be on the short list.  After all that time, you are suddenly being rushed.
1316126533472272384 2020-10-14 05:19:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenWarren Steal?  From who?  Who owns the seat? You? Is the seat yours?  Steal implies illegal.  Please show the law violated.  President nominates, Senate confirms.  Don't whine.  Don't cry.  Don't make BS statements.  Tell us where the theft is.  Or better yet, shut up.
1316112718722605056 2020-10-14 04:24:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MZHemingway I agree, confirmation is a done deal.  Maybe they think that they are putting on a show for the faithful.  I think that they are just for the n-teenth time showing how stupid they are and reminding everyone how scummy they were during the Kavanaugh hearings.
1316111677104955392 2020-10-14 04:20:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NBCNews @Phyllis28540138 Let me see if I understand what the esteemed @NBCNews operation is reporting.  The man who got hit by a car and died, died from being hit by a car.  I think I nailed it, what say you.
1316110452129054721 2020-10-14 04:15:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @fletch63_d Oh.  I thought this was a hearing for a Supreme Court Justice.
1316110040919498752 2020-10-14 04:14:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CortesSteve @BeanK511 I bet the guy on the other end of his teleprompter had his head blow up at that moment.
1316109673423015936 2020-10-14 04:12:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SusanKnowles @KatiePavlich Feinstein does not speak for anyone but herself and the #CCP.
1316109274959888384 2020-10-14 04:11:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DrShayPhD Can you visualize a picture with John Kennedy on one side and Nadler, Nancy, Schiff, Soros, Biden, Harris, AOC, Omar, Schumer, Obama, Hillary, ....... on the other.  There is no Democrat Party, just boatload of Democrat thieves and Marxists.
1316107259072528384 2020-10-14 04:03:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EvanAKilgore What kind of state would elect someone who lied about service in a war where many brave Americans died?
1316106702018600960 2020-10-14 04:01:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CeciliaCmaida @clairecmc I watch @OANN, @FoxNews has gone over to the evil side. Your side.  Apparently, it is not getting a lot of leftist love for selling out the conservative.  It will take years and years to ferret out the scum installed by Obama.  But it is being worked on.  Oh yeah, I block shills.
1316105774544822272 2020-10-14 03:57:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sceptical50 @clairecmc That is a large pile of horse shit.  You leftist shills just lie and lie and lie.  I shun such. Bye.

1316072081394556929 2020-10-14 01:43:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DonaldJTrumpJr @kat_lambkat One Democrat in office is one to many.
1316071150196121600 2020-10-14 01:39:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SchreckReports @yoakumgirl923 Well, I'll be.  I believed that Biden was running to keep himself and his crooked family out of jail for ripping off America.  I never thought it would be to develop new ways to steal from us.
1316036515365969920 2020-10-13 23:22:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenBooker You have no basis to presume a nominees vote on any issue.  If Obamacare is constitutional, it will stand, if it violates the constitution it will be replaced with something better that is legal.  Illegal, unconstitutional benefits may be what you want, but not me.
1316035662001307649 2020-10-13 23:18:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @deray They aren't black men.  Biden said so.
1316035496431157248 2020-10-13 23:18:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @clairecmc Americans died to protect our freedoms and lives.  Waiting in line is not all that horrible.  Besides, they are in line because they do not trust the Post Office and are worried about rampant Democrat election fraud.  It was my pleasure to vote Trump and every Republican. 😄
1316034675370987521 2020-10-13 23:14:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lex31555 @Madamtazzz Did she ask if Barrett would uphold the death penalty for US Senators convicted of being Chinese spies?  Just asking a theoretical question.  PS - Does @SenFeinstein have a letter that she is going to spring?
1316034138206396417 2020-10-13 23:12:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SamanthaJPower Hey, by the way, why did you unmask General Flynn?  Are you part of the attempted overthrow of the US gov't?  PS - You are a Democrat elitist with Deep State Connections.  Can you ask the Democrat Governors to open their states to stop some of the economic devastation?
1316033156890292224 2020-10-13 23:08:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RickSchaler True that.  And would a monkey hug @IlhanMN and endorse her for Congress?

1316031189845602308 2020-10-13 23:01:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Portland_jet Isn't China implementing social credit scores with Google's help?  Will the Democrats copy the #CCP agenda?
1316030685279186944 2020-10-13 22:59:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Hoya97 @AmerMilNews Trump is the US military leader.  The Pentagon Obama appointment holdovers are not.
1316029593229221894 2020-10-13 22:54:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Fluck.  Had to turn off the TV in the other room while I am on the computer.  @CaptMarkKelly ad after ad after ad to the point I could not stand it.  Who is flooding Arizona with millions &amp; millions &amp; millions in a attempt to buy the state through constant lies?  I voted McSally.
1316028850220883968 2020-10-13 22:51:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @perfectsliders Already voted for Trump. 🤣
1316024761340706817 2020-10-13 22:35:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kylie_oneil75 @gatewaypundit That shot of Hillary reminds me that with Thanksgiving coming up, I need to order a new nut cracker.  Walnut that is.
1316024413737738240 2020-10-13 22:34:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> He also had the nerve to say he would fight the DC insiders IN HIS OWN PARTY while @SenSchumer has his lip prints all over his a**.  He would do what Chucky says to as he passes down Soros' orders.  Would he pack SCOTUS?  MARK KELLY, who do you believe. , me or your lying ads.  https://t.co/zADpUVOGc1
1316024410717872131 2020-10-13 22:34:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CaptMarkKelly says he cares about us although he bilked Arizona taxpayers out of $ 15,000,000 on the con of creating jobs in our state and then when the check cleared actually laid people off.  LIE and CHEAT.  He values America, right 🤣.  Ask him about his extensive China ties.
1316024409291845639 2020-10-13 22:34:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> I am getting really tired of being pummeled with Biden &amp; Kelly ads in Arizona.  Which elitist billionaires are trying to buy the state?  All lies  Today a @CaptMarkKelly ad almost made me puke during breakfast.  He is spreading it tell us about his American values  Here they are.  https://t.co/xWWltdhpvt

1316020896411217924 2020-10-13 22:20:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BrandonStraka @WingsofCrystal Loved it.  Very nice.
1316002476793896960 2020-10-13 21:06:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Hoya97 @gatewaypundit Hard to boycott someone you think is a loser and POS and would not watch anyway.
1315984598774419457 2020-10-13 19:55:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MarciaW02564145 This is our fate, all of us except politicians and the elites, if the Democrats take over.
1315983570075148289 2020-10-13 19:51:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DutyOfAPatriot @ReneeCarrollAZ Ten year minimum and make room for other mail carriers that do the same.
1315983318702202883 2020-10-13 19:50:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenatorDole @UPMHPM @realDonaldTrump Looks like the Debate Commission put itself out of business.
1315983068167979009 2020-10-13 19:49:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SJPFISH @wvufanagent99 Hey, look at all of the people that @FoxNews is sending over to @OANN and @newsmax .
1315982307665219584 2020-10-13 19:46:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TheLeoTerrell @realDonaldTrump Together with the fact that we are both very handsome, we have another thing in common.  We both voted for Trump.
1315981105846132737 2020-10-13 19:42:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BrianClowdus @LyndaG1963 @realDonaldTrump Love it.
1315980856977047552 2020-10-13 19:41:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Redwave4Ca @KeithGal0504 He also said Read My Eyes, I will ban Fracking a few weeks before he said that he will not ban Fracking.  So who knows if he will put my back yard garden into a land bank?  Besides, it is not likely that he remembers what he said.
1315979844719579136 2020-10-13 19:36:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dhiggins63 @TheDemocrats @KamalaHarris She wants to be president.  Joe will soon be gone after being elected and she will have the gold ring.  It is funny no one, Democrat or Republican wants her.  Will the Democrats start referring to Harris as, "Not my President".
1315975959066017798 2020-10-13 19:21:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Lrihendry @ckolacia And no Democrat wanted Harris who would be president soon after a Biden win.  Joke is on the sheeple.
1315975390767149056 2020-10-13 19:19:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BlessUSA45 @crt39437 Hahahahahaha.
1315972488304582659 2020-10-13 19:07:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tedcruz You are right.  It is a product of HELL.
1315754733043286016 2020-10-13 04:42:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Tido25425716 @JackPosobiec @posonaut @Twitter Repealed.  Perhaps redo after some thought.  Repeal now because if you give a Democrat / Leftist organization an inch, they will cram a 100 lawyers into it and shop an Obama appointed judge.
1315751813539266565 2020-10-13 04:30:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Hoya97 @BreitbartNews What a really bad joke on the Democrat sheeple types.  None of them want Harris.  She sent blacks to jail over nothing and is crazed left who worked her way up by working Willie.  And now if Biden wins, she will end up being president.  What a joke on the useful morons.  https://t.co/WvZvNAaq4z
1315750180126294016 2020-10-13 04:24:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec @posonaut After the election, Section 230 needs to be repealed.  If that happens what is the expected life span of @twitter?
1315749910629683200 2020-10-13 04:23:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Hoya97 @BreitbartNews Arizona's Democrat Senate nominee.  He won't take or guns or have anything to do with the DC establishment.  https://t.co/n1Ra8JbsBT
1315749583922712576 2020-10-13 04:22:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @IBBrianM @WaitWhat3017 Think of it this way, Barrett is going for a job for life and Biden will likely make it 3 months if elected.
1315749365877633024 2020-10-13 04:21:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @American1299 If there was a white guy in the back row of the church sniffing little girl's hair they would have remembered.  So I am calling LIE on this Biden statement.
1315748946602455041 2020-10-13 04:19:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cgilmer2898 Is #BLM segregated?
1315748584113926144 2020-10-13 04:18:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Hoya97 @BreitbartNews I have no idea what a toobin is and do not watch @CNN, so if a toobin says something on CNN it does not mean much to me.

There may be some local shit, Portland will be burned down for the 150th time, but not an organized campaign.  The Democrat elitists are perfectly willing to sacrifice the useless idiot sheeple, but will not do anything that can be traced back to them.

1315742673068679168 2020-10-13 03:54:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Zapmom @TurningRedish @stillgray @ST7757 Sure the media is for gun confiscation.  Big part of leftist / Marxist push.  And the MSM &amp; most of the news subs are leftist scum.  Don't need no Kool-Aid for that.  Like Venezuela, China, etc. the left can't take a nation until they first take the guns.  I shun shills, so block

You have Medicare, but had to pay a crippling penalty (Chief Justice Roberts said that was OK) for your uninsured spouse?  Thanks to Trump that is gone.
1315708630847512576 2020-10-13 01:39:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marklinn1999 @KatiePavlich There are a lot of people who fell into the gap.  People barely making it  Obamacare took food off of their table because they could not afford the skyrocketed priced insurance.  They were doubly screwed by the Democrats, no insurance &amp; penalized for not being able to afford any.

1315679980790050816 2020-10-12 23:45:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 Wow that would be big.

1315667831657123840 2020-10-12 22:57:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @karenbrennanb @pjcobbrocks5 Nice.  Just voted for Trump, McSally, Biggs, and every Republican on the ballot.  I even checked out the judges with the state GOP.  Remember, 1 Democrat in office is 1 to many.
1315666664730492928 2020-10-12 22:52:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MayorOfLA @Lakers Thanks for your tweet.  I did not know they won because I stopped following the team after it threw in with the Chinese Communists.  Can't say I give a shit though.
1315666077729255425 2020-10-12 22:50:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> 2/2  I will not ask about the $ 15,000,000 you bilked the AZ people out of to creat jobs right before layoffs at your company.  Nor about your ties to China. Nor about you sucking on Schumer's @@@@.  I will just say that me &amp; family just voted for McSally.   You lie.
1315666076550619138 2020-10-12 22:50:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> 1/2  Dear @CaptMarkKelly  Just saw one of your never ceasing or ending stream of obnoxious lying commercials (cost millions, Soros?) where you claimed McSally was part of the establishment and you are independent.  What do you call this? Why are you lying about taking our guns.  https://t.co/NV4H8uV5JR
1315664119035383808 2020-10-12 22:42:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 @gatewaypundit Pretty Pathic.  The Democrats have made two points in the nomination hearing ofJudge Barrett.  1. Orange man bad. 2. She will kill everyone with pre existing conditions.  On 1. They can take a flying leap. On 2. That is an outright lie, all Senators will protect those affected.

1315431729839046656 2020-10-12 07:18:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrAndyNgo @9News needs to be held accountable for this murder.  Sounds like the shooter was an armed thug that the TV station pointed at peaceful protesters.  I would like to see the people at @9News responsible put in jail for a long long time.

1315428828047503362 2020-10-12 07:07:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods @DonMcglashen My wife pointed out that they did better in Yuma a few days ago when 20 people showed up.
1315428334323429378 2020-10-12 07:05:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods @DonMcglashen Since Biden / Harris is up 25 points in Arizona, it is not important that anyone show up.  I am being sarcastic about the poll results, but guess I should have checked the @FoxNews polls, I may have hit their results.

The top tier Democrats and Elitists will never put their own butts on the line.  That is what the useful idiots, sheeple are for.  If they launched overt attacks attacks, it would come back to them and they would pay; big time.

I would guess your values include extreme racisim, taking money from our enemies; China &amp; Russian, and blackmailing Ukraine with our tax dollars.  Your groper in chief will not be the commander in chief.

We will see if the Democrats protect this murderer and his club "Antifa".  Much sick of Democrats.
1315350473029808128 2020-10-12 01:56:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Hi there here is your latest Antifa murderer.  Why do they all look it?  https://t.co/dg8pKm5kaU
1315349832295301122 2020-10-12 01:53:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DenverPolice Have you figured out that he is Antifa yet or are you going with your original lie?  @DenverPolice   PS - Give the people of America one reason why they should trust you.
1315349264982110208 2020-10-12 01:51:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Will @9NEWS and personnel be charged as accessory to murder?  If not, why not?  Is the @DenverPolice another leftist sucking organization that is a joke?  Why did it immediately say the Antifa murderer was not Antifa?  Is it protecting leftist murderers?  Is it protecting Antifa?
1315347589005418496 2020-10-12 01:44:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PsychoSix @MGMWORD @EvanAKilgore How about accessory to murder?  How about @9news as accessory as well?  The Antifa perp was their on their payl as assigned by @9News.   Why did a local bum phuck reporter need armed security at a peaceful rally?  Why was the @9News person mixing it up with the people there?

Why am I paying to support a corrupt criminal orginization?  Why do you hold me &amp; others in contempt?  If I pay for you as part of my gov't why are you keeping secrets from me &amp; why have I no say?

1315318518259183616 2020-10-11 23:49:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KurtSchlichter Are you saying that the @DenverPolice are spreading lies to protect Antifa after a member committed Cold Blooded Murder?  WTF Denver Police, why are you covering up for Antifa and the Murderer?  Also why did you release the reporter who paid the perp to be there with a gun?
1315316551457751041 2020-10-11 23:41:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @stillgray @ST7757 It is clear out murder.  Who is the news station and people who put the armed killer in the middle of unarmed people to attack.  They are as guilty of the murder as the shooter &amp; should be arrested for homicide.  We have gotten to the point where local MSM stations set up kills.
1315314378627923970 2020-10-11 23:32:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChadwickWiz @DGPurser Now that is the best.
1315314180283527168 2020-10-11 23:31:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AtlasEternal13 @JajsaArthur LOL, we appreciate you coming on the show and sidestepping the questions.  That from @CNN.

1315309920825171968 2020-10-11 23:14:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bud_Doggin @alan_alannlane MSM is in the business of both misrepresenting and suppressing news.
1315309674850181120 2020-10-11 23:13:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LionTedPride It is my understanding that McConnell packed the courts numerous times and has raised the number of Supreme Court Justices from 9 to 9 by doing so.

1315302678180708352 2020-10-11 22:46:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HartRenegade @deepcow Spoken like a true pedo.  Anyway, blocky poo.
1315281388073938945 2020-10-11 21:21:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sioxielegend @deepcow It is interesting but it seems the entire focus of the MSM is to keep people from seeing the news.
1315281023148548096 2020-10-11 21:20:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BobRmhenry1 @JackArnett11 It is not a donation.  It is, in some cases, payoffs as a result of a shake down and in some cases money to undermine the gov't so they can globalize against American interests without oversight.
1315280532461117441 2020-10-11 21:18:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MaryWalterRadio @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump According to a @FoxNews poll Biden is up 12 points over Trump among energy workers.
1315280020277878784 2020-10-11 21:16:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Pismo_B @DebbyAJ The Trump crowd was surveyed by @CNN and the result of the poll was Biden +12.
1315279712516620289 2020-10-11 21:14:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kramerreport Disagree.  Biden is running for only one reason and that is to keep him and his family out of jail.
1315279474468950017 2020-10-11 21:13:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NotUnderdog @lightning989 Fry his ass.  Fry the people at the local MSM station that hired and deployed him, they are accessories to murder.  This is a new twist.  Your local TV stations hire people to kill those with an opposing viewpoint.
1315278814872657921 2020-10-11 21:11:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DailyCaller @maftf1956 Nah, they have just gotten permission to broadcast in China.
1315278386730659840 2020-10-11 21:09:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Rasmussen_Poll Bull.
1315278322268397575 2020-10-11 21:09:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gsamu53 Actually what Democrats fear is an honest election.
1315277525422018560 2020-10-11 21:06:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @egatz4u2 @Malcolm_fleX48 1st degree murder.  Fry him and the people in the TV station.
1315277356676771840 2020-10-11 21:05:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @egatz4u2 @Malcolm_fleX48 So the local MSM hires an armed Antifa guy to be a body guard and he starts a fight with an unarmed protester so he can blow him out.  The TV station and the people who hired the thug need to be charged as accessories to murder.
1315276030592999426 2020-10-11 21:00:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Herbert55444009 @nascarred14 @Sundncefn Democrats have to vote for Biden to find out what the Elites in the shadows tell Harris to do after he is removed for mental incapacity.  Oh yeah, I don't know if this is an agenda item but, Orange man bad.  Never forget the wisdom of Carville.  https://t.co/cDO1geJJHz
1315264136897421314 2020-10-11 20:13:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AngelWarrior321 @4allusapatroits I did.  Not so sure any more.
1315263901680820230 2020-10-11 20:12:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit @CassandraRules Watch the preceding video.  The bodyguard was agitating the demonstraters and picking the fight.
1315260247192166401 2020-10-11 19:57:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @nascarred14 @Sundncefn There are three great mysteries in Biden's life.  Where is he going. Where has he been.  And Where is he now
1315259612153565184 2020-10-11 19:55:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Malcolm_fleX48 @yoakumgirl923 So this is a MSM security guard.  Looks like he was out to kill someone.
1315109730788937730 2020-10-11 09:59:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @drdavidsamadi @AmericasImpetus OMG, Joe just infected the 27 people that attended his rally.    That includes press.
1315109367734132737 2020-10-11 09:58:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @pepesgrandma @lisastewart59 It is my understanding that @FoxNews and @CNN ran a joint poll amoung the Latinos for Trump parade particpants and found that Slow Joe was up 15 points.  Go figure.  (Social satire that has a ring of truth when it comes to the MSM).
1315108615267573762 2020-10-11 09:55:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JonahDispatch Democrats are stupid.  The democrat sheeple is slightly above the turnip on the evolutionary scale although infinitely less pleasing.
1315091629548560385 2020-10-11 08:47:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SpringSteps So now the Democrats send in the BLM / Antifa thugs to kill people if they try to peacefully protest.  This cannot continue.
1315089100832006145 2020-10-11 08:37:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NorCalCrush Hey @FBI, you missed one.  Funny how you can get some turkeys in Michigan and miss BLM murderers.
1315088855624634368 2020-10-11 08:36:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NorCalCrush The Biden Campaign is starting a fund for the murderer that will be intially funded by Hollywood celebrities.  VP nominee Harris will oversee the disbursement of the money and no accounting will take place.  Maybe I am kidding, but I think that may be what happens.
1315087843778154498 2020-10-11 08:32:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realTrumpForce @DianaBialkowski Cheat and intimidate.  That is an easy one.  Next question.
1315087714748776448 2020-10-11 08:31:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SonofMan__2 @babysgramma We will see after the election.  If Trump, no bailout, and the states will either have to be fiscally responsible or go under.  If Biden (for a month or two and then Harris), massive bailouts, paid for by other states, which ends up pulling the entire country down.
1315073830042230784 2020-10-11 07:36:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @joehos18 I agree.  Social media has shown that it is not worthy of legal protection and its victims need an avenue of redress.
1315073285869109248 2020-10-11 07:34:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealCandaceO @AwakeNotW0ke The Democrats have tried to frame everything in terms of race, but we are all one in God's eyes.  The truth is simple, it is a war between evil and good and we all know which side the Democrats stand with.

1315071853384278016 2020-10-11 07:28:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RichardGrenell @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Joe won't ban fracking and @CaptMarkKelly won't take the guns from the people of Arizona.  Want to buy a bridge?  https://t.co/rnQabjRtaY
1315070997385469953 2020-10-11 07:25:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MsAvaArmstrong @RobHoey Or the MSM,  Or the @FBI,  Or @TheJusticeDept ,  Or the @StateDept ,  Or the Congressional House,  Or pro sports figures,   Or Hollywood.  It just goes on and on.  America has been shown the Truth about the Democrats and our gov't by Trump and it is enough to make you puke.

But she has also had as much of the Democrat leftist 🐂💩 as she can stand and had no patience left for them or their crap.  We just got our ballots and we will be voting Trump, McSally and every Republican on it.

1314982641968455680 2020-10-11 01:34:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec It is like the chicken and egg question.  Do you become unhinged after joining the Democrats or if you are unhinged do you join the Democrats?  Cause and effect or effect and cause?  One of the great mondern mysteries.
1314982111359590400 2020-10-11 01:32:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JoeFreedomLove @RudyGiuliani Do you think that @CaptMarkKelly , who has extensive financial ties to China, will work with Biden to sell us out for more money?  You know, Mark Kelly is the guy running for Senator in AZ and who is lying to the people of my state about getting the  gov't to take their guns

1314927816723451904 2020-10-10 21:56:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SusanStJames3 How many BIG PHARMA ads do you see on TV during a normal, non election week?  The drug industry and their well paid lacky MSM want to keep us sick and buying their high / over priced crap.  Keeping us ill and frightened goes a long way to accomplishing that.
1314909109834018816 2020-10-10 20:42:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @richtallman @Simply4Truth PS - Why did the President of the United States have to hear this from a Radio Personality and not dirctly from the AG?
1314908687043981312 2020-10-10 20:40:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @richtallman @Simply4Truth No one is going to say it.  But after the election, I expect some world order paybacks.

Sullivan is one of the poster boys for everything wrong in the judicial system.  Strangely he ties back to Obama, who would have thought?
1314905435955105793 2020-10-10 20:27:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BobLonsberry @RobBailyRoc IDK  I had a large number of small doctor run medical practices as clients before Obamacare &amp; only have one now.  They all went out of business &amp; joined larger hospital staffs where they work 9 to 5 &amp; fight over assigned parking places.  Very sad.  I can't believe they like it.

After @FoxNews put Ryan on the board and hired Brazile, I clearly saw the hand writing and moved over to @OANN.  I find OANN superior to Fox in every way.  After a few of the 'Old Timers" leave, @FoxNews will be below @CNN in ratings.

There are incredible people there and the state was beautiful before the leftists burned it down.  Unfortunately CA has become one of the symbols of destruction of a state by Marxist government.  I hope you can get rid of the Democrats one day.

Cuomo has forgotten, "...Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,..."  The consent of the people is primary not that of the government.

1314652141181521920 2020-10-10 03:41:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Ilhan Point to the article that say, "Hey, it is OK to kill your baby, even after it is born".  Hey, hows that election fraud thing going?  By the way, give a shout out to our Arizona boy @CaptMarkKelly who endorsed you.  We both know that he is lying about letting us keep our guns.

The fact that he bilked the taxpayers of Arizona out of $ 15,000,000 promising jobs &amp; then laid off people when the check cleared is enough  His business dealings with China is enough
1314555923520647168 2020-10-09 21:18:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ckkirsch1 @d_roneal Quiz, which member of the squad did @CaptMarkKelly endorse?  Hint, she was just brought up on charges by the House Ethics Committee.  Take away, if Kelly endorses @Ilhan doesn't that mean he agrees with her agenda and is lying to the voters in Arizona?  https://t.co/arOFjHeZ6q

1314554230024269825 2020-10-09 21:12:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CROWENATION2020 To the leftists in gov't, what will you do when the money runs out?  To the leftists in gov't, if Biden destroys the economy who will fund your pension and pay for your medical insurance?  To the leftists in gov't, once the cancer kills the body, there is nothing left to feed on.

Forget about @CaptMarkKelly 's lies about taking our guns, Forget about his bilking AZ taxpayers out of $ 15,000,000, Forget about his business ties to China,  Remember he is a corrupt Democrat who lies to us
1314548585862590465 2020-10-09 20:49:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @hrkbenowen Well, she will be president a few months after Biden wins so they should either vote against her or get use to her.
1314548040590520320 2020-10-09 20:47:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WvTrump @Yelp Beyond sued, one must ask if they can trust reviews on yelp?  Will people start posting reviews based on @yelp s consumer alert or lack thereof?  BLM will see this as an oppertunity to extort protection money from small businesses.  I used Yelp, not any more from this day on.

1314542450388598784 2020-10-09 20:25:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @StanziMir @stbythec Rush is estimated to have between 15,000,000 and 40,000,000 listeners.  The audience will be larger for Trumps appearance and parts will be widely rebroadcast.  So much for Social Media trying to surpress Trump.

1314538425777700865 2020-10-09 20:09:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @petefrt The Committee will be housed in Schiff's secret bunker and will call secret witnesses to testify.

1314280094047768576 2020-10-09 03:02:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FoxNews Hasn't that ding bat already tried the 25th Amenment?  The Democrats have attacked Trump so consistently, so much, and tied to mounds of crap over the last 4 years it is hard to keep track of their current bull 💩.
1314279488570572801 2020-10-09 03:00:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto @USAHipster If the Democrats claim victory through election fraud, what will the American people do?
1314258300075032576 2020-10-09 01:36:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LadyRedWave Will the NYPD obey the DeBlasio, Cuomo orders to attack the Jews in Brooklyn NYC?  If they do, will they wear the new uniforms he has had specially made for them?  I say, NEVER AGAIN!  https://t.co/7v4Vl9OBFQ
1314251763092844546 2020-10-09 01:10:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump no
1314249828755406848 2020-10-09 01:02:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AOC Now do $ 8.00 a gallon gas, before taxes, higher prices on everything including food that is transported, winter fuel bills that cause you to freeze you ass off, unemployment, humongous air fares, and on and on and on.  They may love you in NYC but there is a real world too.
1314231777146269696 2020-10-08 23:50:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GBbbbbzzzzz90 @catturd2 @buds1008 @BreitbartNews @OANN @newsmax @FoxNews Imagine if he went over to @OANN or @newsmax when his contract runs out.  @FoxNews would finish below @CNN by a ton.
1314231112395223040 2020-10-08 23:48:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Pismo_B @JoeBiden Bricks supplied through the curtesy of Soros and the @DNC.
1314230836229677059 2020-10-08 23:47:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DrShayPhD @CNN Given a few more months and Ryan will have Fox below that.
1314230516057473031 2020-10-08 23:45:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LeslieD3rd @my3monkees Bingo.  The polls are their as verification of the Democrat election fraud and are nothing more.  They are as fake as a ballot in @Ilhan 's district.
1314227882969853952 2020-10-08 23:35:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KatiePavlich Although I never intend to eat an airplane, I get your drift.  Sorry, could not resist that one.
1314226325465382912 2020-10-08 23:29:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kylie_oneil75 @gatewaypundit If the NYPD obeys DE Blasio's anti-Semitic unconstitutional order, they all should be issued SS armbands as part of their uniforms.
1314225717991763969 2020-10-08 23:26:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HillaryClinton @KamalaHarris Hahahahahahahaha.
1314225351984250880 2020-10-08 23:25:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MattBatzel Tosa Dem should look at who he and his neighborhood are supporting.  He and they would not have to beg Trump supporters to not burn down their house.  NOTE: Twitter would not let me tweet a response on my time line.
1314224190052941825 2020-10-08 23:20:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AdamMilstein @Algemeiner You bet.

Besides they would have to increase his drugs and under the jacket drip if he had a longer distance to walk to the podium.
1314221976257392640 2020-10-08 23:11:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TrumpLadyFran Now you know why @SpeakerPelosi funnels money to the @PBS, money that should be going to you, in their porked up bail out of Democrat messed up states bills.   It is a neat racket, the Democrats take your tax money and the extort your relief to send momey to those who lie to you.
1314220563481546752 2020-10-08 23:06:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TrumpLadyFran @FLConserve941 @SenMcSallyAZ PS -  I made a contribution to McSally's campaign and my entire family will vote for her.  We need support for Trump in DC not for Schumer (sucking noises coming from Kelly) and Pelosi.
1314220125495554052 2020-10-08 23:04:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TrumpLadyFran @FLConserve941 @SenMcSallyAZ You mean I shouldn't vote for the China connected guy who Bilked me as an AZ taxpayer out of $15,000,000 while dumping AZ workers, and is lying about taking away my guns?  Him?  https://t.co/DVUvHOH8dL
1314218855309352961 2020-10-08 22:59:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TrumpWarRoom @missnormagene And you can't see it in the picture, his fly was unzipped.
1314218499066134528 2020-10-08 22:58:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 @buds1008 @BreitbartNews I am sure that @OANN and @newsmax approve of Ryan's work at Fox.  So if Ryan gets his way, what happens to Tucker, Hannity, Dobbs, Payne, Ingram, Judge Piro, and few other good ones that are actually the only reason that anyone even tunes into @FoxNews any more.
1314205643620802560 2020-10-08 22:06:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Rasmussen_Poll @carriedaway16 Hey all, Kamela LIES.  Any of the ding dong leftish sheeple know that she blew 🐂💩 in their face?
1314204803803693057 2020-10-08 22:03:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BloodBrief @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump Really?  The debate commission did a heck of a job in not seeing Joe's wire and not testing him for drugs during the first debate. We are all confident that Joe's team did not have the questions before the debate.  &lt;---- Sarcasm.
1314204229297303554 2020-10-08 22:01:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ape_noble @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump BS, but you have to admit that Biden is so close to the long trip downstairs to meet his diety that even a cold would pop him out of this world.
1314203654115606529 2020-10-08 21:59:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump I agree with Trump.  Biden will stand behind his podium with hidden tubes feeding him drugs to keep him upright and semi coherent, he will be fed answers over a telepromter, there will be a hostile moderator, and some friggring leftist clown with a mute button when Trump speaks.
1314191111305322497 2020-10-08 21:09:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JimHansonDC Puck you Cuomo and the criminal leftist anti-Semitic horse you rode in on.  And your little dog DiBlasio too.
1314189044721410048 2020-10-08 21:00:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced @dedicatedtoUSA LOL, lot of good stuff there.  I forgot that in 2016, Biden was the only person in the country less popular than Hillary.  If you give any credibility to the @CNN poll at all, Biden was much less popular.
1314187112099373056 2020-10-08 20:53:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Yanky_Pollak When I see this, I feel pride and proud of the Brookly Jews for standing up to the 2020 Nazi strain that is infecting the country.
1314186622817034241 2020-10-08 20:51:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kirstiealley @flatwalk @peta @Greenpeace Beyond that, the Trump administration does take the issues seriously and has and will pursue a reasoned approach that considers all interests.  The Democrat iron boot on the neck methods do not work.  Besides look at what China / Marxist Dem supporter &amp; Biden friend is doing.
1314185842353610754 2020-10-08 20:48:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AOC @Mike_Pence You are not his Congresswoman.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  You are not my Congresswoman either and don't even want to know how we refer to you in my home.
1314185027853275136 2020-10-08 20:45:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @charliekirk11 @FocusCheryl Interesting, those numbers are much like the C-Span &amp; Telemundo polls after the Trump / Biden debate.  It is clear that the only way the Democrats will win is by massive election fraud.

1313938737420627968 2020-10-08 04:26:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BillHemmer @FoxNews Give it a little while.  Your hard turn to the left together with the Ryan touch of death will end up making @OANN and @newsmax major players while you end up a pussy second to @CNN.  @BillHemmer say hello to Brazile for me. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1313937934194671616 2020-10-08 04:23:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump A big no.
1313937263634522113 2020-10-08 04:20:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @darhar981 If Biden is elected, his first act will be to pardon himself.
1313937074496532480 2020-10-08 04:19:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JamesOKeefeIII Dear Arizona neighbors.  @CaptMarkKelly is LYING TO US.  @CaptMarkKelly will take our guns.  If he is elected there will be nothing we can do about it and he can come out and thumb his nose at us and come after our #2A rights.  Look at Venezuela after the guns were taken.
1313935787604336640 2020-10-08 04:14:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDerekUtley @realDonaldTrump @OldRowSwig Will America accept a Democrat victory knowing it is the result of election fraud?  If fraud, we do not have a gov't that represents us, we have a dictatorship that will use force to hold power.  We will be China, Venezuela, Cuba, etc. all rolled into a Marxist ball.
1313934361121579008 2020-10-08 04:08:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jtpallai1 Looks like Harris outpulls Biden by 60 or 70 people an all 85 stay awake for part of the rally.
1313896030899851265 2020-10-08 01:36:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kelliwardaz @CaptMarkKelly @IlhanMN PS - Here is @CaptMarkKelly who will represent Arizona, its, people, and our values.  Take a close look at the picture.  Is that what you are and who you want controlling your life?  McSally for Senate.  https://t.co/JluyHnsXUm
1313895419395493888 2020-10-08 01:34:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kelliwardaz @CaptMarkKelly @IlhanMN 2/2  @CaptMarkKelly just ran an ad saying that he will not vote with Democrats in corrupt DC.  He is running against his party (big lie) while sucking Schumer dry (yum).  And indeed, Kelly has huge financial ties to and is growing richer from China, who Biden calls our friend.
1313894676408102913 2020-10-08 01:31:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kelliwardaz 1/2  @CaptMarkKelly   Endoses and supports @IlhanMN .  Nice shot of group hug with helped burn down Minneapolis Antifa daughter.  Bilked Arizona tax payers out of $ 15,000,000 by lying about jobs he will create and then laying off workers.  Lying about taking our guns.
1313873689318879232 2020-10-08 00:07:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ScottAdamsSays How many patients in their seventies, would die from COVID-19 if Democrat Governors like Cuomo did not stack infected people into nursing homes?
1313873075339812866 2020-10-08 00:05:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @my3monkees Who will the Democrats come after next, after the Jews.  My money is on the Catholics, but we will see.  NEVER AGAIN, better to go down fighting than to quietly get into a railroad car.  Even better is to fight and live.  Democrats are the real modern day Nazis
1313871947474718720 2020-10-08 00:00:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sxdoc @scott_helmick Mr. Cunningham has issued a statement to the effect that although he has screwed around on his wife and left his kids to suffer the pain of watching his infidelities play out, he will keep his word to voters.  Just kidding, we all know that he and all Democrats are lying shits.
1313870321942843392 2020-10-07 23:54:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BRijswijk @EinsteinsMagic I appreciate all input from morons, but do not agree.  Anyway, after four years of leftist stupidity, I have no patience left so am going to block you.  Bye
1313834575148195841 2020-10-07 21:32:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KatieHill4CA @Twitter It was the Russians.  I just know that it was the Russians.
1313834140131708929 2020-10-07 21:30:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump They are going after the Jews in NYC at the moment.  If you believe in God, you are the enemy of the Democrats.

1313820458718904321 2020-10-07 20:36:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EinsteinsMagic NEVER AGAIN.  The Democrat Party has two distinct religious underpinnings; atheism and Satanism.  So first the Jews and then the Catholics and then the rest.  We all must stand for God and say NEVER AGAIN for any of us for it will be for all of us when done.
1313818495096741889 2020-10-07 20:28:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @steve_c1970 @reubing I disagree.  Obama is fit to clean toilets, not much more, but toilets yes.
1313817998625447936 2020-10-07 20:26:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealOmarNavarro @maftf1956 So what is next.  A book deal? A fat contract with @Netflix? Talking bobblehead at @CNN or @FoxNews? Place on Biden's campaign committee? Partnership in Law Firm to represent the @DNC in its election fraud litigation? Special council after a Democrat is elected president?
1313814145997828096 2020-10-07 20:11:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joelpollak @kohl427 @CaptMarkKelly At least that saves us from hearing another lie.
1313812642969001990 2020-10-07 20:05:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 @FoxNews poll, Biden 108%,  Trump -6%, with 12% undecided.  Margin of error +- 44.44%.  Based on 17 calls to the Minn @DNC.

1313588015667712000 2020-10-07 05:12:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @TrumpLadyFran How does Kelly lead in Arizona when he wants to take our guns away and has just bilked the state's taxpayers out of 15,000,000?
1313587085618507776 2020-10-07 05:09:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @iammix24 That one is to easy.
1313586523753783296 2020-10-07 05:06:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Pismo_B Biden outpolled Trump at the rally after the six opinions were tabulated.

1313511405669117952 2020-10-07 00:08:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PVeritas_Action @Project_Veritas @CaptMarkKelly PS - In the 20 minutes I had the TV on in the background while eating breakfast, there were 3 Kelly lie commercials.  It makes sense that someone with his millions to spend (wonder where that came from) would do well in the polls.  He is buying the pollsters.
1313510641152389121 2020-10-07 00:05:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PVeritas_Action @CaptMarkKelly Just heard a fake poll on Fox local news, you come for the weather &amp; get the crap too, that says Kelly is ahead in Arizona.  It is hard to believe that the people in my state would vote for an identified liar who would take their guns, who biked the state, them, out of $ 15M, etc

The last two years have been horrible and an attack on  America and the American people and every Democrat in the House supported it.  Did Crist vote for the impeachment based on an obvious hoax?  Will he put you ahead of Pelosi?
1313250049376219136 2020-10-06 06:49:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> I still have not received an answer from the @NYPD.  Will they obey an order for an armed invasion of the NYC Jewish communities to shut down the houses of worship?  What will the NYPD do if the Jewish people stand to defend their temples.     https://t.co/rIcuC52H6h
1313249029107580928 2020-10-06 06:45:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TomFitton In breaking news an Obama appointed judge ruled that President Trump can't do that and has issued an order prohibiting it.  He will be bringing his case before judge Sullivan who will be acting as defense and prosecution as well as judging the matter.  Just kidding, a little.
1313247870066192389 2020-10-06 06:41:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @donaldsangel @Jim52177990 Is the guy who lied about taking their guns to Arizona voters (among many other things) and who endorsed the Somali woman who married her brother and is illegally harvesting ballots still standing strong with her and her Antifa city burning daughter?  https://t.co/3mb5mn3x2i
1313246400654635010 2020-10-06 06:35:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @2222vj @ScottTBrower1 @thehill Time for the Jewish Community to get it.  The Democrats are not the party of the past.  I wonder if the Jews have always been conned by the racist Democrats who they thought stood for the rights of all  The Democrats are racist anti religion bigots who want power.  They are evil
1313223594005065728 2020-10-06 05:04:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @thehill I have one question for the @nypd.  Will the officers obey a "order" to close down Jewish Synagogues and perhaps fight the Jewish members of their community who try to protect their right to worship the GOD OF ISRAEL?  I would really like a no BS answer from the cops.
1313222876112154624 2020-10-06 05:01:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump Good for our 401ks.
1313222640954347520 2020-10-06 05:00:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @evers_oak @GlamLover555 @FoxNews polled that crowd and found Biden ahead by 15 points.
1313217991002132481 2020-10-06 04:42:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @thehill I am livid, so please forgive me for going on.  But we now see that the Democrats will come for a people and there is no one safe from them.  There cannot be one Democrat in office for the people of this country to be safe.
1313216823446310912 2020-10-06 04:37:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @thehill Either we have a first amendment as part of the Constitution or we do not.  Time to find out and time to find out if while the city burns by the protected hands of violent Antifa / BLM Marxists the Democrat leadership sends the police to the peaceful Jewish community.
1313216127955169280 2020-10-06 04:34:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @thehill Time to stand up and say NEVER AGAIN.  If Cuomo comes for the Jewish people, they need resist with all means at their disposal.  I am not Orthodox, but would support any and all means of resistance to the pogrom.  The Democrats have morphed into the Nazis of 2020.   FIGHT THEM.
1313213886221307904 2020-10-06 04:26:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marklevinshow So mostly white BLM types attack a black woman because she loves the country and yet we are to believe that the whole Marxist riot thing is based on the fight for racial justice.
1313213404316753920 2020-10-06 04:24:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto @Breaking911 Fortunately that will have no impact on Biden rallies.
1313210622054526976 2020-10-06 04:13:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CHIZMAGA Did anyone point out that the hot air and other putrid gases emanating from Wallace made it hard to breath with a mask on in the front rows.
1313209975271907329 2020-10-06 04:10:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CarmineSabia @marsha9753 Why the @WashingtonPost is paying her big money to be her.  If they don't care why should I?
1313209354003247104 2020-10-06 04:08:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lukeobxx Truth.  Kelly will sell out everything Arizona and everything America.  Somebody is paying untold millions to incessantly pound the people of Arizona with his lie ads.  I wonder who is funding his deception of me and my neighbors.
1313207476515270657 2020-10-06 04:00:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @roxie32819 Why are the police protecting the violent thugs?
1313207177021018112 2020-10-06 03:59:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TIMENOUT @gatewaypundit Question, what is Trump going to do when Wray and Haspel defy him and refuses to obey the order?

1313202083370156032 2020-10-06 03:39:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @maggiempowell @BIZPACReview PS -  Haspel and Wray also know of his pedophilia and perversions (sniff sniff grope grope) and his attacks on helpless women.  Yet they protect him because he will protect them.  Wray and Haspel are not my America.  They are so dirty, it offends me as an American citizen.

He has enriched himself and his family by selling America (us) to foreign enemies. His treason, They know much more, we can't even guess.  And yet they protect Biden to cover up their own criminality and would have him president.

They know that Hunter took at least $ 3.5M from Russia, perhaps more. They know that Hunter took $ 1.5B to invest from China, perhaps more. They know that Hunter was on he board of Burisma &amp; Joe....
1313199284494368768 2020-10-06 03:28:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Catheri17371327 Don't forget that Mark Kelly, recently of @Project_Veritas fame for lying to Arizona voters about his intention of taking their guns, endorsed her and supports her.  He is a picture of Kelly with @Ilhan and Giffords hugging Omar junior, the daughter, who is in Antifa and a hater.  https://t.co/3Cxt7x9NNS
1313183402380595201 2020-10-06 02:24:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit Hard to believe that people pay good money, often borrowed, to bask in the wisdom of that turnip.  Higher education has become such a con.
1313179829374599169 2020-10-06 02:10:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marklevinshow @CIA Is it clear why these people are out to get Trump now?
1313179674722230273 2020-10-06 02:10:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marklevinshow Hey look, it is part of the Deep State, the @CIA saying in your face America and skrew you Americans.  Somehow these gov't toads believe that they run the country and the people have no say, just pay your taxes or else.  That is not my America or the America of our founders.
1313170135264317441 2020-10-06 01:32:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Any word yet from Mark Kelly as to why he is lying to the voters of Arizona about taking their guns away?
1313169855609073665 2020-10-06 01:31:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DCMoshe The interesting thing that I find is that the Deep State Bureaucrats act like they are playing a game and we, the American people, do not exist.  Who does Haspel think she serves?  Who pays her salary, her operational expenses?  Same with Wray.  I am tired of the DC garbage.
1313139034974089216 2020-10-05 23:28:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TomFitton @JudicialWatch How does that work?  If I incorporate in another state, what can CA do?  It cannot dictate other state's laws.  Seems like a good reason not to incorporate and run a business out of CA.
1313138401529356288 2020-10-05 23:26:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> I, for one, am just getting tired of him bullshitting the air waves and cannot wait (together with friends and family) to vote for McSally.  Strange, the amount of contempt in which he holds the people of Arizona.  PS - What happened to the $ 15,000,000 he bilked us out of?
1313138400812179456 2020-10-05 23:26:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Wow, the television if playing in the other room, no one watching and local Arizona Fox is on (by accident).  In the last ten minutes I heard 4 Mark Kelly messages.  It is amazing how much "certain" people are paying for him to blast us with a never ending stream of lies.
1313136894738198529 2020-10-05 23:20:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BeschlossDC Doctors at the hospital reviewed the situation and found it was fine and no threat to the SS Agents.  So who the phuck are you?  In answer to the first part of your question, because Trump cares about his supporters and wanted to show them that he is grateful.
1313136239634075648 2020-10-05 23:17:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @roxyloveslucy Nah, it takes a while to come down from the drugs.
1313136052110934016 2020-10-05 23:16:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews just took a V.A. poll and you came out at 12% while Biden was at 94%.  Fox claims that the sum of 106% is OK and they have a scientist to confirm that.
1313134778581876736 2020-10-05 23:11:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BusyDrT @SNCCLA If the Democrat base / sheeple wore #masks and destroyed their brains, what difference would it make?  No one could tell the difference.  The probable result will be the charge that IQs above room temperature is a privilege.
1313133188747718656 2020-10-05 23:05:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @heatherjones333 If you look at the murder rate in NYC, Chicago, Balt, etc. that have strong gun control laws, the armed Mexican Cartels on Arizona's borders (coming over all of the time), &amp; the violence of Antifa / BLM &amp; were Mark Kelly, you too would lie about taking peoples guns to get elected
1313131876383563781 2020-10-05 23:00:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @davidaxelrod @POTUS You may want to tell Nancy who is taking a bottle of booze every day to Impeach him AGAIN.
1313131445305573376 2020-10-05 22:58:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @OANN There are other reasons.  Since they can't keep him drugged up all of the time, the masks keep him from drooling on himself.
1313131140841041920 2020-10-05 22:57:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BlissTabitha No, polls are faked as a lead in to Democrat Election Fraud.
1313128131440439296 2020-10-05 22:45:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JamesOKeefeIII Mark Kelly has issued a statement;  "Who do you believe, me or your lying eyes?"

If the Democrat / Marxists flood Arizona with Antifa / BLM after Kelly takes your gun, how will you defend yourself and family?  If Kelly is lying about this core issue, is he being truthful about health care?
1313112368889524225 2020-10-05 21:42:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Equis36 @robbipl @SteveScully I think Trump should call the debate until such time as an honest moderator can be found and Biden agrees to be checked for wires and drugs.

I really don't want to live in California.  People are fleeing that state because of Democrats like Kelly who have lied to them.  If Kelly is lying about guns, is he lying about Health Care, Social Security?

Then he laid people off  Can you trust Kelly for anything?  How about your health care, what LIES IS HE tellng there

Do you feel that journalists that print bogus stuff to harm a person, political candidate, or the country based on sources that do not exist or false information should be sued silly and sent away for a long time?  Not that I am saying that the @NYTimes does that.

1312754259515985921 2020-10-04 21:59:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mpukita @tpdeod32 Arrests and executions for treason and attempted assassination of the president.
1312753172595654657 2020-10-04 21:55:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @donniejspencer @BernieSanders OK, after viewing this throng of Biden supperters, I now believe the @FoxNews poll that Biden is a ton of points ahead.
1312747703818805249 2020-10-04 21:33:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MAGABNT @Cocofritz If people believe that the Deep State infected the President and other political leaders, what must they think it would do to them if they get in the way?  I don't know what the cause was, but it is chilling to see what people think of their own gov't and much is justified.
1312746386832551940 2020-10-04 21:28:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrAndyNgo @LoriIllia @KatieDaviscourt Who brings explosives to a peaceful protest?  Antifa, an idea.
1312746125821059077 2020-10-04 21:27:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @newsmax @KarmasKeeper81 I thought excessive drinking made sleep difficult.
1312745941212950528 2020-10-04 21:26:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CHIZMAGA @RayBaresi There are some places that you cannot bus in actors to pretend support.  Bernie should know to avoid them.
1312745401498312707 2020-10-04 21:24:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ABC @ABC just another Leftist Mickey Mouse crap network pretending journalism.
1312743754810363904 2020-10-04 21:17:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MoooPapa Out of curiosity, who are the 4.1% who think Biden is actually leading?  It is hard to comprehend that level of stupidity.  Or are they, like all Democrats, just lying?
1312743166651494400 2020-10-04 21:15:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kramerreport Imagine if Biden is elected.  Harris would soon be President.  That means she would rule with 100% of the Republicans against her and 98% of the Democrats against her.  Not much of a consens, that.
1312742567339933704 2020-10-04 21:13:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jsolomonReports Even though the DC circuit and Obama judges everywhere are already pushing it to the max to get Trump, they will now redouble their efforts.  Imagine America with an honest Judiciary?  That does not fit the narrative.
1312741625240592386 2020-10-04 21:09:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ShakaThaGod @tbone9070 Nothing to see, just another Democrat Pedo Perv.  The Democrats want people like him to make our laws and run our lives.   Wouldn't most Democrats like him be better off living in LA and running a kiddy porn site rather than holding elected office?

1312737545420107778 2020-10-04 20:53:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> After looking through his ties with the "movement", you may want to read about how he bilked us Arizona tax payers out of $ 15,000,000 to create jobs just before laying off a bunch of people  If you have time left, peruse his extensive financil ties with China who he will support
1312737544191176705 2020-10-04 20:53:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Morning Arizona  Kelly would be our Senator.  He endorses &amp; supports @IlhanMN who is working for the overthrow of our gov't.  She is running on Election Fraud.  Omar's daughter took time to pose with Kelly.  Kelly supports Antifa / BLM and the torching and looting of cities.  https://t.co/DKU5GMGZXR

I am still not sure because I cannot believe that the Democrat / leftist elites will put their asses on the line.  Yes they would willingly throw ignorant sheeple into the fire but never themselves.

1312437741552955393 2020-10-04 01:01:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LucasLey2 @ConservVoice Probably the NYTimes tax story source hustling a few more bucks.
1312437380570210304 2020-10-04 01:00:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @liquidlaugh Of course.  Except for the top tier (Clinton, Obama, Harris, Biden, and a few others), it is surprising how cheaply they can be bought and how easy it is for them to sell out you, me, and the country.
1312425381161361409 2020-10-04 00:12:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @pjcobbrocks5 @KamalaHarris When Pelosi / Schumer said so, what exactly did they mean?
1312417238402514946 2020-10-03 23:40:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KamalaHarris An honest judge and tie breaking vote on SCOTUS will really mess up the Democrat plans for election fraud.  PS - I voted for MY President and last I checked his term runs until mid January.  I am a people, does my will not mean anything to you.  Will it when you become Pres.?

Now they don't give a phuck about you.  Some are selling their CRAP in monopolistic markets, you are trapped.  Some are part of mega corps (@CNN / @ATT) &amp; are pushing agenda.
1312393725616689153 2020-10-03 22:07:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced You left out Dobbs, Watters, Gutfeld, and the rest of the supposedly brave and truthful squawking heads.

Sadly, the Democrats have time and time again demonstrated that no evil is beyond them, so this has some credibility.  Most that was a conspiracy theories in 2016, 2017 have turned out to be true.
1312391872212463616 2020-10-03 21:59:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kathyand37 @FrauPatriot @gregkellyusa I have not looked at Newsmax, but am sure that it is top notch.  When @FoxNews hired Ryan and then Brazile, I saw the direction it was going (next @CNN) and subbed to @OANN.  I like OANN and am much pleased with its coverage.  It is great that we now have two good choices.

1312137457744322560 2020-10-03 05:08:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Thomas1774Paine Hence the new mad dash in Honduras aimed at our border.  I guess they want to get here before our money runs out.

With Mueller, Comey, and now Wray as directors, the agency did not have a chance.  It needs to be dismantled and spread in the nearest garbage dump and a new, honest, not corrupt, actually cares about America agency built.

1312023285819867138 2020-10-02 21:35:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @roxyloveslucy Apparently the secret source that gave them the supposed tax returns told them.

1312021101573103616 2020-10-02 21:26:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ConservVoice @gatewaypundit Yeah, to those who were counting on their 401(k) for retirement or emergencies, if Trump loses, you are SOL.  The leftists that will quickly replace Biden will destroy the economy.  No jobs, no economy, and ideed kiss that 401(k) bye bye.  Look at Venezuela if you don't get it.
1312000320122220544 2020-10-02 20:03:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tedwheeler Even the faithful are not stupid enough to buy that crock.  Ask Wheeler why he moved.
1311999780646604801 2020-10-02 20:01:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrAndyNgo Can you see the image?  Antifas sitting around a table with plates of feces and bowls of pee laughing and joking as they spoon the stuff into balloons in preparationas for a night of non violence.  This is the true Democrat base.
1311998042854178817 2020-10-02 19:54:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dhmorrow1 @sioxielegend Want a clearer statement of the goal of the Marxist Democrats?  Armed takeover and then mass executions.  Just like Russia, China, and Cuba to name a few.
1311996917702823936 2020-10-02 19:50:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SusanStJames3 @fedagentmark Shun them as you would any evil.
1311996539611430912 2020-10-02 19:48:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods To be clear, I meant @CNN, Cooper, and "friend / snake".
1311994533522010115 2020-10-02 19:40:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods This is disgusting .
1311815486070423552 2020-10-02 07:49:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott I am sick and tired at the Republican bullshit and lack of basic loyalty
1311815312963039232 2020-10-02 07:48:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott Please explain to me why you @LindseyGrahamSC and @SenatorTimScott  feel the need to come out with this crap.  Trump has supported you both and may be the reason you (Scott don't know about Graham) are reelected in November.
1311814538614861824 2020-10-02 07:45:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AngelaBelcamino @realDonaldTrump Dear Lady or whatever you identify yourself as.  Your poll is bullshit.  Go over to the C-Span poll or the Telemundo poll.   If you want to play with yourself, be my guest, but I don't want to hear it when you are trounce in November.
1311813174677499904 2020-10-02 07:40:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott Now say something about his fourth nomination for a Nobel Price for bringing peace to the middle east.
1311812773127413760 2020-10-02 07:38:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HillaryClinton Hahahaha  What a maroon and a lying one to beat.  https://t.co/2CmlfCDk1h
1311812225682731009 2020-10-02 07:36:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Callie_BTW @jsolomonReports PS - You are blocked, I shun leftists.
1311812076155752450 2020-10-02 07:35:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Callie_BTW @jsolomonReports Hey turnip brain.  Pelosi said she did not read Obamacare before it was voted on.  What make you think that the Democrats read a bill that was dropped right before the vote.  They did not have time either.  The difference is that the Democrats don't care, they vote as ordered.
1311769964957691904 2020-10-02 04:48:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @prayingmedic Nope.  Trump needs to demand an impartial moderater or tell the self appointed commission to take a hike.
1311769053065666560 2020-10-02 04:44:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GmanFan45 @KaraMar111 @JoeBiden @FBI @POTUS Clearly,  Chris Wallace and @FoxNews have their finger on the pulse of America (&lt;- sarcasm).  Wallace cited Wray as he stepped in for Biden and led the attack on Trump.   Take away?  Wray is a Deep State shill and must go and Wallace debated Trump as Biden interupted constantly.
1311766926104780801 2020-10-02 04:36:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Sparty80GoGreen @magajcs This is the mayor of he city where people are being gunned down, children shot, in the streets.
1311766072626868224 2020-10-02 04:32:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ByronYork LOL, can you see a committee of Soros, Clinton, and Romney choosing who we can vote for.
1311765521608527872 2020-10-02 04:30:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tomselliott @FrankFigliuzzi1 Agree, so do everything you can to make sure no Democrat gets elected to anything.  One Democrat in office is one to many.  I'm begging, I don't want to live in the northern version of Venezuela (a rich and prosperous country until the left took over).
1311764941511168000 2020-10-02 04:28:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tomselliott @FrankFigliuzzi1 So the people don't get a say.  We need to wait until a group of elitists who attained their position though no way know to the people tell us who we get to vote for because they don't approve of our choices.  @MSNBC 🤣
1311763949805682688 2020-10-02 04:24:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @brad_polumbo @Obielicious Isn't that the @FoxNews media inbred turnip that threw a shit fit on the WH lawn?  Is this the best that Fox has to send to the WH.  I am so pleased with my sub to @OANN and can't believe that I once was a loyal Fox viewer.
1311762399356047361 2020-10-02 04:18:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JamesOKeefeIII @mysilmaril @Twitter @Project_Veritas On 11/04, let the law suits begin.  It will be interesting to see if the new SCOTUS and Congress in January believes that @twitter has section 230 protection.  I have no shares of @twitter stock so do not feel that I will take a big hit as the status of twitter is resolved.
1311761274523447296 2020-10-02 04:13:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Heminator @BobG727 Oh gee.  Biden lied. @CNN backed him up.  Nothing new, just the same old flow of Bull Shot from the Democrats and MSM.
1311760696149831680 2020-10-02 04:11:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WayneDupreeShow @CincinnatusPax Is this meatball what @FoxNews presents as news?
1311755875917287424 2020-10-02 03:52:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lions_us @realDonaldTrump My guess is not.  Once that happens, there will be no where for them to hide.  It would be a fatal mistake.  If they think that Antifa / BLM can take the country, they are delusional.  Til now, those thugs have only been able to attack their own cities with Dem mayor protection.
1311754963232546816 2020-10-02 03:48:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @trish_regan @deplorablejjb I thought the next one is scheduled to be hosted by an ex Biden staff member.
1311754710202769408 2020-10-02 03:47:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TomFitton @TurningRedish Well @FBI &amp; @TheJusticeDept what say you.  What is your plan if America says no to the Democrat election fraud on 11/04?  Will you institute a police state like those in China and Russia?  Is that your plan?
1311753883052515329 2020-10-02 03:44:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tgpwlm @AdamInHTownTX @reubing I agree about the stock.  There are a number of tech &amp; media companies that will crash on 11/04 after a Trump win.  They have been operating under the protection of the law which prevents them from being sued and have been a restrictive monopoly in their area.   That will end.
1311752755325755394 2020-10-02 03:40:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DFonshill I think so.  She is a low life thug and in your face America criminal.  Even though she is pure evil, a Qatari spy, a bigot, a racist, and is working to destroy America, not all people feel the same way as the person I am responding to.  Some support her and have endorsed her.  https://t.co/HyNj0vVdep

1311748961879744513 2020-10-02 03:24:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @heatherjones333 @cocoaudie What difference does it make.  No one gets their news from those network's news shows.
1311748090076905473 2020-10-02 03:21:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AdamInHTownTX @reubing What about the shareholders?
1311747989812080640 2020-10-02 03:21:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @reubing Paul Ryan has brought the same intellect to @FoxNews as he did to the 2012 election and the Speakership of the House.  The only difference is that he is not now trying to hide that he is in the bag for the left.  I sub to @OANN and it is top notch.

1311727929508806658 2020-10-02 02:01:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @McguireScotty Hey Arizona  Can you believe this?  Not only has @IlhanMN been outed for massive election fraud this week, but now we find out that she is a spy for Qatar.  And there is so much more.  Who in the world would endorse such a despicable, corrupt person for her House reelection?  https://t.co/k5Ow9rMLCc

Where does @FoxNews find these newsy inbred morons?  I happily did not know who @johnrobertsFox was until I just saw his temper tantrum.  Fox, do you believe that his rage is news content?  Do you think anyone wants to see it?
1311724197341622273 2020-10-02 01:46:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @charliekirk11 @CarolHello1 Pretty much like Kelly in Arizona.  Bilked taxpayers out of $ 15,000,000 to create jobs and immediately after the check cleared layed of a bunch.

I'm watching his melt down over Proud Boys &amp; he looks directly at the camera &amp; says he does not care about the people "hammering" him on twitter, many of whom are Fox viewers.  Where does @FoxNews find these @!CNN rejects?  News incest
1311711343582408704 2020-10-02 00:55:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Crossbearer1956 One side lesson of the debate was provided by Chris Wallace @FoxNews.  He exemplified everything wrong and biased and hatefully contemptuous of the American voter / viewer.
1311709261471256576 2020-10-02 00:47:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @liquidlaugh You underestimate the ability of Hollywood donors together with Biden's staff to come up with the big money to set the attempted cop killer free.
1311708922969948160 2020-10-02 00:45:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> PS - What happened to the $ 15,000,000 you took from Arizona taxpayers to develop jobs shortly before you laid off a bunch of AZ employees.  PPS - Care to tell Arizona voters about your extensive financial ties to China?  PPPS - Do you do everything Schumer tells you to?  I
1311708921808076800 2020-10-02 00:45:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> To John Kelly of Arizona  You are running for the Senate in AZ. You endorsed @Ilhan for the House in MN. Omar has been shown to be engaged in extensive election fraud.  1 Will you withdraw your endorsement of Omar? 2 Will you promise AZ voters you won't engage in cheating?  https://t.co/cIOGDg2GDU
1311707101886992384 2020-10-02 00:38:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MZHemingway @Rigged_It Same as with Biden although in Biden's case it is true.
1311706349248552961 2020-10-02 00:35:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jsolomonReports Trust Pelosi this time.  She would not screw you over like she did on Obamacare which no one had a chance to read before the vote?  Besides, the Democrats don't have to read it.  They will just vote the way their masters tell them to.
1311704881325989889 2020-10-02 00:29:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @D60836328 @penkalski_amy Tucker has called out every fraud and biased yahoo except for Wallace.  What is up with that?  @TuckerCarlson
1311704427300941825 2020-10-02 00:28:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DonaldJTrumpJr I understand the lead question to Biden in the next debate will be, "Do you prefer Pepperoni or Sausage on you Pizza".  After a short pause while Biden gets the answer in his earphone, the answer will be given.
1311703237263650816 2020-10-02 00:23:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cspan Wow final results and 325,000 respondents to a "neutral" entity.  Biden did not even break 19% while Trump was pushing 70%.  Meanwhile every lying MSM POS will tell you two things.  1 Biden was not wired and drugged up. 2 Biden won the debate.
1311649781308030976 2020-10-01 20:50:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kayleighmcenany Biden said during the debate that Hunter never got $ 3.5M from Russia.  Wallace did not challenge him on that.  America, the Wallace - Biden team just blew smoke up your tailpipe.  @FoxNews has become @CNN .

You colluded with Russian spies.  Wow.  You are right, Trump is not running against Biden.  Biden is a figurehead for your corrupt criminal organization, the Obama cartel, and the Deep State.

1311483391632535552 2020-10-01 09:49:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lavist1 @FoxNews This is interesting because Biden is under criminal investigation for the crimes he bragged about / admitted  I guess Wallace felt the @NYTimes unverified secret source story was more important  Also, let Wallace know that Trump had 3 (now 4) Nobel Prize Nominations  He missed it
1311482748373090304 2020-10-01 09:47:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lavist1 1/2  Somebody please forward this video over to @FoxNews attn: Chris Wallace.  Apparently he is either not aware of it or does not think blackmailing a foreign government with AMERICAN TAX dollars to keep it from investigating his sons crimes that he enabled is important.

1311461826043944961 2020-10-01 08:23:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RepBarbaraLee I did when I voted for Trump.
1311461596447731712 2020-10-01 08:23:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChadPergram In other words, we intend massive election fraud and do not want a tie breaking vote on the Supreme Court when our theft of American right to a represented government is challenged.

1311449922038763521 2020-10-01 07:36:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WyoMerica @JKash000 His voice is weaker and trembles, he needs to go back to the meds he was on yesterday.
1311449565325787139 2020-10-01 07:35:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @StrategicCPLUSM @JKash000 Who is Biden to dictate what anyone's FAIR SHARE of taxes is.  Isn't that some moron telling you how much of the money you earn that he will let you keep?
1311448821386231808 2020-10-01 07:32:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JKash000 @Ajax2847 OK, Biden is back to semi coherent.  Either his electronic feed is on the fritz or they are cutting back on his meds.  He should have asked Wallace to accompany him on his trip;.  He does much better when Wallace helps.

1311447185179901953 2020-10-01 07:25:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SethAbramson Fake Poll -   Here are two real ones:   https://t.co/9U8mBNpz19   https://t.co/Mb9XAG8DpU  One thing you have to hand the Democrats, they hae a fake poll for every occasion.

1311444137426649088 2020-10-01 07:13:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EricEarly_CA Biden said he was going to install millions of outlets all over the country to plug your car  A company headed by Hunter is already negotiating with the Chinese to manufacture them.  Sarcasm, yes but not stranger than a state that can't produce electricity mandating electric cars
1311442271854682112 2020-10-01 07:06:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 @Ajax2847 I don't remember Wallace mentioning the nominations for a Nobel prize as a result of bringing peace to the middle east yesterday.  Didn't Biden mumble something about Trump's foreign policy while Wallace's head bobbed up and down.
1311441459510308864 2020-10-01 07:03:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Ilhan What will happen when eviction notices &amp; foreclosures start happening?  Or are you advocating the theft of real estate property?  By the way, how is the election fraud going.  Hey everyone with a home or property in Arizona, this crazed fool was endorsed by Kelly.  https://t.co/JnU3pzOPLH

1311434546554920960 2020-10-01 06:35:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced So what.  Typical Democrat shit as described by Pelosi (don't remember the term she used).  MSM puts out bogus crap &amp; Deep State / Democrats cite it as a reason to investigate.  Any investigation of Hunter's $ 3.5M from Russia?

1311362442186731521 2020-10-01 01:49:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @paulsperry_ Wow, Comey has adopted the two tiered Rod the Weasel Rosenstein testimony strategy.  1. I am to stupid to have understood that.  2. I know, knew nothing.  Funny how the key people signed off on a restricted warrant application to a secret court without knowing anything.
1311361134222430210 2020-10-01 01:43:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cvpayne I do not believe that the President of the United states should give a moderator power to cut his speech.  Wallace was bad enough with his constant interruptions of Trump, but that would be beyond the pale.
1311358946251137024 2020-10-01 01:35:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sioxielegend Two bad that Wallace was not aware of the news four years ago and has yet to catch up or he would have called Biden out on his lies.

It is what they are.    Besides, name one honest person who cares about the country and its people in the Democrat party.  Take your time.
1311338222006403072 2020-10-01 00:12:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 No one cares on the Democrat side.  He will be trash canned on Nov 4th.
1311337474392616960 2020-10-01 00:09:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mkjboise1 @nyinvesting Guy needs to be fired &amp; will be.  The question is when.  Wallace throwing Wray's lies in Trump's face last night may have accelerated his departure  The poll is, will Wray end up on the board of @FoxNews, as a talking head in MSM, as professor at Harvard, or working for @netflix.
1311336407244312576 2020-10-01 00:05:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @YarnellSheila @Andromodid Guess Wallace of @FoxNews missed that one.

1311335419217231873 2020-10-01 00:01:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dagmarecho @DeanBrowningPA Levin would be top notch, knowledgeable, fair, and strong.  That would disqualify him in the eyes of the Democrats.  Hard to believe both Wallace and Levin are on Fox at the same time in the same universe.

1311334647444373504 2020-09-30 23:58:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Hoya97 @BreitbartNews There are those in Arizona that are on the Biden train.  Here is one.  Maybe he will be getting his own @Project_Veritas video soon.  Hopefully he is not pushing election fraud as hard as his Minnesota buddy.  PS - Trump is well ahead of Biden in AZ, don't believe fake polls.  https://t.co/hV3TpoTcs1
1311333802627616768 2020-09-30 23:55:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec Trump did, he said sure when asked if he disavowed white supremacy groups.  You must have missed it, but you would not admit Antifa exists or talk about BLM.  By the way, I understand that you are being sued for slander by the 17 year old kid that you slandered.  Good luck.
1311332908854964224 2020-09-30 23:51:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sxdoc @tazmac55 Serious question for Chris Wallace.  Why did you not ask Biden about the Ukraine, his video where he brags about using taxpayer money to extort the government and the fact that he is under criminal investigation there?
1311332341822812161 2020-09-30 23:49:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @tommy4trump They don't care.  Biden is running to keep himself &amp; most of his family out of jail for their crimes while he was VP &amp; before.  The Democrats and Deep State are backing him to protect themselves because of their criminal acts.  And everyone knows that Biden will be quickly gone.
1311331102921863168 2020-09-30 23:44:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JessicaVaugn @DaileyOfficial If you remove Tucker, Dobbs, Hannity, Payne, and a few others, Wallace is at home with his peers.

1311329325883379712 2020-09-30 23:37:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ConservVoice @gatewaypundit Go ahead and sue.  The Hollywood mega donor can afford it.
1311328914883538944 2020-09-30 23:35:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Dear @CNN you may want to remove your fake poll before a lot of people see this honest one and you are further embarrassed.   https://t.co/9U8mBNpz19
1311326024269930502 2020-09-30 23:24:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RichardGrenell @JoeBiden I can see it.  Do you really want to return fire? What is your motivation? Are you visualizing that white perp as black and actually being racist by arresting him/her? Lets talk about confiscating Molotov Cocktails.  Do you think it will make them mad? Burning things is good!
1311323871035813889 2020-09-30 23:15:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MZHemingway Oh no, the "I am a complete moron" defense together with "I know nothing".  I was afraid of that.
1311322728390041600 2020-09-30 23:11:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @charliekulyrwah @javelinsst1972 Indeed.  It is clear that Biden was prepared for the questions.
1311321700802334720 2020-09-30 23:07:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ScottPresler @digibd66 As opposed to CA and other Democrat run states where you can register up to a month after the election.

1311302996865642499 2020-09-30 21:52:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Is there any reason that Wallace failed to ask Trump about his three nominations for Nobel Prizes for bringing peace to the middle east.  He could have segwayed into the Obama / Biden admin sneaking millions in cash, in the dead of the night, to Iran.  Then there is Benghazi.
1311302084692553728 2020-09-30 21:49:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @THeinrich22 @JakeMc945 @FoxNews Is there any reason that Wallace did not ask Biden about his history of racism &amp; his recent statement about black people not being black if they don't vote for him.  Wallace shut Trump down when he started to point out Biden's racist history &amp; the harm he did to black Americans.

1311300220618076161 2020-09-30 21:41:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TimRunsHisMouth To be fair, Biden would condemn Antifa and BLM if they existed.
1311298357072023553 2020-09-30 21:34:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @copdoc1 I do.  Do you think that Biden should have faced America and the world and lied about Hunter getting $ 3.5M from Russia.

Now we are finding out that Wray covered up for @FBI criminality which supported the Russia hoax and the false charges Flynn tragedy.  Wray's next gig will be on @FoxNews board.

1311295668971945985 2020-09-30 21:23:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cspan It is my understanding that Democrat operatives will be bringing in truck loads of poll responses that were found in a garage and those responses will provide a clear win in the debate for Biden.
1311295223880794117 2020-09-30 21:21:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> 2/2  .... non existant people, ballots found discarded in fields, and on and on.  I am not sure if Wallace was lying to America about Democrat fraud, providing a case on why Wray should be fired, or both.
1311295223062953984 2020-09-30 21:21:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> 1/2  One of my favorite Wallace attacks on Trump is when he challenged the massive Democrat election fraud going on by invoking @FBI Wray's name.  This right after the @Project_Veritas @IlhanMN videos, the Trump military ballots thrown away, mass mailing by Democrats to...
1311292756854099969 2020-09-30 21:12:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Crossbearer1956 Wallace probably is not up on the news.  Otherwise he would not lie like that to America as he moderates the debate.
1311292532668555264 2020-09-30 21:11:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bubblebathgirl Joe Biden said to America and he world during the debate that Hunter did not get $ 3.5M from Russia.  Sounds like the Whopper of the night although Antifa is a concept is up there as well.

There is always some con going on.  I cannot definitively say that it is not a watch but lets face it, Biden was wired out the wazoo.  Maybe had a drip going as well.
1311287781298065408 2020-09-30 20:52:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TrinaAltadonna @lightning989 Yeah, not sure wtf Biden was talking about  Antifa (a philosophy or something) &amp; BLM have said to the people in the suburbs that "we are coming for you".  They have threatened &amp; run sorties in suburbs around controlled cities.  And yet Biden says people go to soccer games.  WTF?
1311285749359063041 2020-09-30 20:44:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LibertyBell1000 @nypost Biden specifically said that Hunter did not get $3.5M from Russia.  That is a lie that he can be hung on.

1311281981221564417 2020-09-30 20:29:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @neeratanden @senatemajtr8tr Now do an honest poll.   https://t.co/L7wIKVixH0

If this video is true Biden had more wires in him than the bionic man.
1311280006539046914 2020-09-30 20:21:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SeanCordanon @ShudaKudaWuda Wow, all the shots that I have seen to date shows one device head on in Biden's cuff.  If you watch closely, for a second half way through there is a second device to the right of the first one.  Wow, Biden was wired and dripped to the max.
1311279145821720576 2020-09-30 20:18:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TrumpWarRoom @jeanigum His good buddy Xi blocked Americans from examining the Chinese poison factories.
1311278634695450626 2020-09-30 20:16:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KLF @laurahartner And yet, and yet Wallace never called him on it or asked what the Biden Plan is.

Or is it a communication system so he could be fed responses.  Or did he have both.  In any case, no surprise, Biden cheated.
1311276145447333889 2020-09-30 20:06:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @my3monkees @realDonaldTrump It is my perception that the VAST MAJORITY of Trump supporters want America and Americans to prosper.  And Americans include Latinos, Black, White, male, female, short, tall, and everything in between.  I am glad that the truth of that is being recognized among all Americans.
1311275386366357504 2020-09-30 20:03:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods @KimDillow6610 Yeah, Biden lied all night.  That was ok with Wallace.

That would leave Harris as President &amp; 99.99% of the Democrats despise her.  So the Democrat sheeple are in a no win position.  They don't want Trump for sure, but don't want Harris either.

Simply, I think Democrat socialists are a plague of evil on the land.  And I am not religious and still think that.  Anywho, I was referring to @JerryNadler and not Gaetz.
1311081169551724544 2020-09-30 07:11:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gearybooks @RepMattGaetz @JoeBiden Making money available to young people without great judgement is not doing them a favor.  College Tuition ballooned because there was plenty of money out there to pay.  Colleges have become a huge con, selling degrees required for a job at high prices while providing little.
1311047479878541312 2020-09-30 04:57:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Cocoa_Bean10 Have you yelled to Biden asking what the Russians Paid his son 3.5 million for,   Or how the Ukrainian investigation of his criminal activities is going,   Or what drugs is he on,  Or what he thinks of the Democrat Election Fraud,  Or if he thinks the $1.5B from China was a gift.

Nadler agreeing with @RepMattGaetz  and stating that Biden stood with the Credit Industry which paid him much to fuck over college students and strangle them in debt.  WTF?    So the young people drowning in college debt owes it to @joebiden .  Wow, who knew

How many of them were actually elected and how many stole the representation of the people as provided under the Constitution?

Has he made a statement as to whether he supports election fraud?  Does he still support Omar?  Most importantly, will he use her tactics in our state?  Much smells with him.  https://t.co/URWN0eYC6b

Is the @FBI so inept and poorly talented and run that it did not twig to the common knowledge that Omar was buying votes and stealing the votes of aged Somali immigrants?  My guess is that it is a combination 80% of 1. an 20% of 2.  Wray testified no fraud, which is he?

Everyone in Minneapolis knew of the fraud.  1.  The @FBI is completely corrupt and is "in on it".  Is the bureau under Wray protecting Democrats engaged in election fraud?

Drugs tht they cannot afford because BIG PHARMA overcharges hugely.  I hope that Trump can win on this one.  Everyone who is not there now will be there soon enough.

The @NYTimes has a long history of printing bogus and false stories based on its desire to push the Marxist narrative it wants to replace the Constitution with.
1310607086372306944 2020-09-28 23:47:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bubblebathgirl So your point is that everyone leaving NYC is not using a U-Haul?

There is no proof that they have the tax returns if anything, that the materials are true, and that they have verified anything.  So far all they have is we should trust them.  Nah.

1310587540026486784 2020-09-28 22:29:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @stillgray Two questions for America.  1. How many agents, attorneys, and other people does the @FBI and @TheJusticeDept have in Minnesota?  2.  Why is it that that extensive federal law contingent did not twig to @IlhanMN pervasive and everywhere election fraud?  It seem like everyone knew
1310578392291373062 2020-09-28 21:53:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LucySullivan888 We knew how much the Obama / Biden administration esteemed the US Military even before Biden called OUR soldiers stupid bastards.

1310577740127506432 2020-09-28 21:50:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CNN Isn't that what Pelosi was talking about when she was describing the fake news cycle.  You know, one #fakenews outlet putting out a lie story and every MSM #fakenews outfit quoting it and reporting not on the event but the lie?  And @CNN, you are the fakest of all fake news.
1310576831905423361 2020-09-28 21:47:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PamelaGeller So @IlhanMN thugs are running around with bags of money to buy votes.  I wonder who provided those bags of money.

1310574136012414977 2020-09-28 21:36:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bennyjohnson @JamesOKeefeIII So we had to put up with @IlhanMN and her hate gang for the last two years because she won by Election Fraud.  Geeze, how disgusting is that.
1310573436549263361 2020-09-28 21:33:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TomFitton @willbarrett_1 Which state was it where Democrat activist judges said the signature on the ballot does not have to match the voters?  I don't think it was Minnesota, but the Omar thugs comments made me think of it.
1310571799294271490 2020-09-28 21:27:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @steph93065 @maddow Good point.  The @NYTimes citing the importance of protecting the multiple felon who allegedly provided copies of the tax returns will not provide the identity of such person or show the tax returns &amp; supporting information it claims to have.  Remember:    https://t.co/wXa10H2peF

1310568862132219904 2020-09-28 21:15:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BernieSanders Hi Bern Guy  Have you seen the tax return? Have you verified it as accurate? Have you seen any of the many of Trump entities returns? Do you know who the multiple felon who supposedly provided them is?  What do you really know?  If nothing, why are you shooting off your mouth?
1310566250888609793 2020-09-28 21:05:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TimRunsHisMouth @1pocketaces And another 300 on @IlhanMN to start
1310565297703641089 2020-09-28 21:01:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MSNBC @nytmike @Morning_Joe Dear @MSNBC  Have you seen the tax returns? Have you been able to verify that the materials claimed by the @NYTimes exists and is valid.  If not, why are you reporting on this and making that statement?  It is just rumor mongering at this point.
1310564571728326658 2020-09-28 20:58:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 @reubing Democrats kill.  Who pays for it?

1310397813021310979 2020-09-28 09:55:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TomFitton @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Simple.  If the @NYTimes has anything, let it show what they have and substantiate it's authenticity.  The Times has constantly lied to America over the last four years based on nonexistant bogus supposed sources.  More leftist Bull.
1310397100983816192 2020-09-28 09:53:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump No.  We don't even know if there is any truth to what the @NYTimes is reporting.  After the Obamagate attempted coup based on a Clinton Funded dossier which itself was based on a Russian Spy's disinformation as promoted by the Times, I do not believe anything they claim.

Releasing supposed tax returns is a criminal act &amp; using the office to influence an electionis a double criminal act although typical Democrat.
1310395231087460353 2020-09-28 09:45:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Eli_Z12 @4YrsToday @Sisters4everT @nytimes 1/2  If you are asking about the materials being published by the  @NYTimes being true, there is a big difference.  The Times lies.  This is another "secret sauce" story where they claim a source publish shit and then hide who it is, trust them.

You know the big fish are going to get away with it.  You won't and they will kick you under the bus at warp speed.  My question, is it worth the jail time?

Considering the massive amount of Democrat Election fraud, no one can substantiate the claim that Trump did not win the popular vote.

If it comes down to it, after the left is destroyed there would be no protection for Obama, Clinton, Biden, &amp; criminal hench people &amp; they would face harsh justice.  They know better than to go there.

Those like Schumer, Nadler, Schiff, Engel, and so on who sold out their religion, their heritage, their people, and God for 30 pieces of silver and a little power are the most contemptable.  To all American Jews I say, Never Again.

Does he already have the questions?  I don't trust @FoxNews the home of Donna Brazille who stole debate questions once.  Will Trump be debating Wallace rather than Biden?

How great life could be.  How our young could thrive.  PS - For the leftist haters, two parent does not define gender it defines number.

Ponder this miss, just because you cannot understand something does not mean it is not true, it just shows that your are limited.

1310192178191151105 2020-09-27 20:18:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kylegriffin1 So Trump has a 52% approval rating and is down 10% to basement Joe.  20,000+ show up to a Trump rally and 15 to a Biden rally.  Erp, erp, erp does not compute, erp, erp, erp .

1310188241451016192 2020-09-27 20:03:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 They stopped being Jewish when they ran as Democrats.  Same as all once Christians.  Democrats have no belief in God.  That would conflict with their adherence to evil.
1310185465954275329 2020-09-27 19:52:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AnaCabrera @mkraju Jeff Sessions replay.  We know how that turned out.

Did he know a major source of the dossier was a Clinton paid Russian spy?  People interested in purjury want to know.

1310034056982134786 2020-09-27 09:50:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HelloTeamTrump No kidding, I think that Kelly is trying to drive us to suicide with his incessant never ending totally lie ads.  You can't escape them.  Makes you wonder who is pouring in so much money trying to buy Arizona.  We are not for sale.
1310033310731571201 2020-09-27 09:47:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lou_galt13 Good morning Arizona.  Did you know Kelly bilked our state, us, out of $ 15,000,000 and then kicked our friends and neighbors to the curb by dumping them?  And don't even get me started on Kelly and China &lt;--- Not our friend.

1309998316642426880 2020-09-27 07:28:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @honorablemdwife OMG  I wonder if the makes Mark Kelly who is running for Senate in Arizona nervous.  He endorsed her &amp; there were group hugs all around.  Retweet please.  Arizona needs to know Kelly supports the Minneapolis anti Christian, Jew, American who encourages riots, looting, and hate.  https://t.co/ff7MG1jnOv

It will be interesting if they accept this as lost and swing back to sending out their Antifa / BLM troops to riot and burn things down.

1309993710059315200 2020-09-27 07:10:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChadPergram The 7th Circuit Vote was 55 to 43 to confirm.  That was just about 3 years ago.  So what is new?
1309991138548314114 2020-09-27 07:00:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @montaga @ObamaNewClothes @JoeBiden Well said.  Truth.
1309990737136644096 2020-09-27 06:58:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @starknightz Geeze, and Biden is sitting in his basement.

1309987947966377985 2020-09-27 06:47:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MikayesFiona 1/2  I repeat, Roberts is the reason we still have the unconstitutional POS called Obamacare.  It would have been 5 to 4 against.  How about his screwing the country by siding with the lefties about the citizenship question on the census?

1309981646909628416 2020-09-27 06:22:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @matisc @willchamberlain It is done.  Donate to Trump and local Republican Candidates.  The Democrats need be beaten back on all fronts.
1309981393552773120 2020-09-27 06:21:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TrumpWarRoom @tweeta_wood Huh, Woof Blister said that?

I do not think that Cubans who escaped the horror and tyranny of Cuba need a lot of motivation to reject the Democrats.  A picture of Obama cavorting with Castro will do it.
1309979972421824512 2020-09-27 06:15:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 Flip that seat.  For every Democrat shown the door America grows a little stronger and better.
1309979500017455104 2020-09-27 06:13:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MikayesFiona Does not matter.  If it comes to an honest interpretation of the constitution Roberts is meaningless.  If we had the court we will shortly have, Roberts BS vote on Obamacare would not have any meaning.
1309978699383451649 2020-09-27 06:10:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BreitbartNews No win.  The fight is already over and Barrett will be confirmed.  Done.  If Harris attacks, she will come across as ugly and revive images of Kavanaugh,  If she pussies out, her loyal base (&lt;-- joke) will shred her.  What is Harris to do.  Popcorn.

1309977279087353857 2020-09-27 06:04:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ResidentOfFL @BarackObama @TheDemocrats The worst thing that the ACA did is put a huge fine on lower income people who did not have employer insurance and could not afford the huge (ACA caused) individual premiums.  It took food off of their table.  Obama, Biden, and their cohorts really put it to many poor.

Mark Kelly endorses this.  Mark Kelly "hugs" this.  What does he have planned for Arizona if elected?

Lack of bias, truth, and even handed coverage are things that you will find greatly lacking in the MSM.  Simply, many are tied of the MSM lies, Bull Shit, and incessant pounding of non Democrats.

1309830953930428417 2020-09-26 20:23:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SaraCarterDC @GenFlynn You left out of Sullivan and the corrupt DC Circuit .  Democrat skum.
1309670915706249217 2020-09-26 09:47:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LadyRedWave Wow, she is starting to get the zombie look too.  I know she is old, but what is it with Democrats that they look like the living dead?
1309660350111911937 2020-09-26 09:05:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realTT2020 Bought and owned.

1309658013976780800 2020-09-26 08:56:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JusticeAmyConey @realDonaldTrump Not real account.  Read bio.  Don't get sucked in.
1309639424917950464 2020-09-26 07:42:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RolandiaKarnak @GOPWarLord Joe Biden has already retired from public life if his campaign for President is any indication.
1309639159103979521 2020-09-26 07:41:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @charliekirk11 @MulliganTrails Because the morons who live in Seattle voted in the Mayor and City Council.  Washington is the most beautiful of states with the most wonderful people when you eliminate Seattle and the Hi Tech people.
1309637521207259136 2020-09-26 07:34:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sioxielegend Clearly it was not an adoption agency that the Clintons had anything to do with.  The kids ended up in a good supportive loving home and not being sex trafficked.   Did I mention it, Democrats are the lowest scum on the earth.
1309636798570586112 2020-09-26 07:31:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 One Democrat in Congress is one to many.  Flip that seat. Flip that seat. Flip that seat. Flip that seat. Flip that seat. Flip that seat. Flip that seat. Flip that seat. Flip that seat. Flip that seat. Flip that seat. Flip that seat.
1309636306717171712 2020-09-26 07:30:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RenaCBSW @FloridaDude297 It will be my pleasure, my families pleasure, and everyone I know's pleasure to vote for McSally.  I can't conceive of my wonderful state being represented by him.  What a POS.
1309594808533409792 2020-09-26 04:45:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump I love the begging for forgiveness line.  Nailed it.
1309594508410068992 2020-09-26 04:43:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BlueSeaSailing @nypost I agree.  She needs to sue the city red, white, and blue and then sue it again.
1309593297589997568 2020-09-26 04:39:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jsolomonReports @ray_hessel I am sure that many will be, hope their coverage did not lapse.
1309592943108390912 2020-09-26 04:37:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FOXLA Likely a party with no face masks and a lot of beer.  But then there is always CA.

1309591823896072192 2020-09-26 04:33:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @9innings2 @FloridaDude297 On the other hand you have someone who endorsed an anti  Christian, anti Jewish, anti American, hater and instigator of riots, and who committed a large number of crimes.  Kelly is in bed with Omar and the worst of the worst.  Arizona needs to know what he is.  https://t.co/LLpXodVP0b
1309591069764378624 2020-09-26 04:30:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 Kelly is real skum.  He is blitzing Arizona with incessent ads that you can't escape telling lies and spewing BS.   When you get a chance talk about the $ 15,000,000 he scammed the state taxpayers out of, his financial ties to China, or his sucking on Schumer for a start.  https://t.co/Sa9qjwXxyU
1309589589766537216 2020-09-26 04:24:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LeahR77 @TheTruthDamit Nah, he can keep on lying.  It is not like the moronic sheeple that are the Democrat base will know the difference.  Besides, the MSM will back him up.  It will be interesting to see if Kelly comes up with a new set of lies in his Arizona ads or keeps on going with the old ones.  https://t.co/AigTWKP3Hf

When he got up in front of the cameras and waxed eloquently about Mueller being an honest and honorable man, I almost puked.  WTF is up with him?
1309586565799145472 2020-09-26 04:12:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @michellemalkin @MarcusT23762392 Bet the 1,000 were all registered Democrats.

1309568340340346880 2020-09-26 02:59:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AngelWarrior321 These companies want to destroy America &amp; hand it over to leftist politicians that will respond to their money.  Why?  A lot of reasons, but one is -  Most are strongly against Trumps policies toward China.  They profit emensely from China's slave labor &amp; access to its markets.
1309566863806885888 2020-09-26 02:54:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SheldonRothMD1 Hey, as long as @Nike, @Disney, @apple, etc. are making big profits off of slavery in China it is cool.
1309565854606979072 2020-09-26 02:50:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @starknightz The University will be refunding all tuition and compensating students for time lost.  Won't it?  Man, I wish I had gone to Law School.  The suits are going to number beyond counting.
1309565330444877829 2020-09-26 02:47:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AngelWarrior321 @kidgolferman For Biden that was close.
1309565235892613120 2020-09-26 02:47:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump School Choice, wow.  Our kids can once again obtain a quality education provided by people who are not declared Communists and are not tired from rioting all night and trying to teach class the next day.  Let's provide all kids a chance to use their minds.
1309564179544592384 2020-09-26 02:43:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @davematt88 You can always hope.  It is how #resistance scum ride.
1309563612910858240 2020-09-26 02:41:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RepMattGaetz I nominate this for understatement of the year.
1309563407343861760 2020-09-26 02:40:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @may_talcott It is actually Soros, but Soros runs Barry so I checked off Barry.
1309563186366963714 2020-09-26 02:39:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto And then there are states run by Democrats, places of misery and not a lot of hope.
1309543219919646720 2020-09-26 01:20:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LABeachGal1 retweet please.

1309535093115953152 2020-09-26 00:47:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @InGodIDoTrust @TenNamesLater I guess, unlike the Democrats forced many Americans to, they don't want to die.  When you vote, remember that the Democrats kept the Hydroxychloroquine from you while the took it to save their lives.
1309534470060478464 2020-09-26 00:45:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Thomas1774Paine I thought they were waging total war now.  The only thing left is to finish arming antifa / BLM and go hot.
1309534121262112769 2020-09-26 00:43:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SpeakerPelosi Are you going to rip it up for the cameras too?
1309533880966283265 2020-09-26 00:43:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJPollack @KelemenCari @FBI It seemed to happen a lot against Trump.  Mutiny!  If there are "good people" in the @FBI, it is time for them to stand up en mass and tell America the truth.  Will the "good people" let the country fall because of their silence?  And yes, the police need to stand up too.
1309531919625797633 2020-09-26 00:35:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SpringSteps Of which country?
1309531676461027328 2020-09-26 00:34:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ohboywhatashot Why is @FBI director Wray protecting Antifa and BLM.  Has Uncle Joe sniffed Greta yet?
1309531390602436609 2020-09-26 00:33:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BreitbartNews Not true, but her base eats Tide Pods and does not have enough brain cells left to recognize the lie.
1309530944894763008 2020-09-26 00:31:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SaraCarterDC If true then, unlike with the Democrats, at least I'd have my guns to defend my children.  LOL, besides everyone knows that the Democrats are a bunch of pervs &amp; pedos.  Would you leave your 12 year old daughter alone with Biden?  🤣
1309530453079027714 2020-09-26 00:29:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit Has Hollywood bailed her out yet?
1309530139068305409 2020-09-26 00:28:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJPollack @KelemenCari If so, there would have been an uprising at the @FBI long ago.  There are little to no secrets in a giant bureaucracy.  Everyone knew.  Do you think that the "top" hired people who were honest &amp; quality?  Do you think the middle, hired by the top, hired good people?  Sad.
1309528587679051776 2020-09-26 00:21:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @my3monkees I would tell the people of FL to upgrade their tires.  Does FL ban studs.
1309528346074607618 2020-09-26 00:21:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto Apparently they will call for riots if they don't get them.  Grand Jury deliberations are secret.  Tired of the leftist shit.
1309497210661302272 2020-09-25 22:17:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @thelittlelotus @kaitlancollins Wow, imagine that.  An @FBI director lying to Congress while under oath.  Who could believe such a thing could happen?
1309470293476294658 2020-09-25 20:30:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @hrkbenowen Wray may not care at this point, rather he may want to do as much harm as possible before he is fired after the election.
1309470014496337922 2020-09-25 20:29:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @thebradfordfile @ovejef The minute the charade is over, half of Washington is going to be sued.

1309461161159454721 2020-09-25 19:54:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GKJoe No thugs were arrested in the filming of this video.  WTF?  Are the riots getting police support?
1309456218163826688 2020-09-25 19:34:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrAndyNgo @petefrt Any word on whether the rioter damaged the truck?
1309448926156656640 2020-09-25 19:05:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dbongino I don't know.  It could be Mueller.
1309307025302593536 2020-09-25 09:41:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @rising_serpent @SAndricsak And to this day, this has not been cleaned up.  Wray has to be fired with prejudice.
1309294001900584963 2020-09-25 08:49:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gardenofthegods The police should be ashamed of themselves for engaging in this.  And "following orders" does not cut it.
1309293483560112128 2020-09-25 08:47:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marklevinshow She is a real piece of work.  I rember when she waxed forth against the male of the species.
1309293144836509696 2020-09-25 08:46:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @hrkbenowen I read the comments and responses and it is very sad the degree of low regard, contempt that the American people hold the @FBI.  After Muller, Comey, and now Wray the agency is a joke but a bad one.
1309290928343932928 2020-09-25 08:37:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @hrkbenowen No.
1309270004408266753 2020-09-25 07:14:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marklevinshow So when they riot and burn down Portland for the 140th time, will they be protesting the 2016 election or the 2020 election?

1309269039433183232 2020-09-25 07:10:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joshdcaplan If true, it will be interesting to see if she phucks everything up as much as she can just to be a dick.

1309229527944421376 2020-09-25 04:33:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Crossbearer1956 Only the Democrats would disenfranchise the military.

1309226662496595972 2020-09-25 04:22:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JoeFreedomLove @gatewaypundit The Portland school district has assigned a substitute to take over his classes.  Just kidding, but I wonder if it is true.
1309226257742094336 2020-09-25 04:20:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec They are punks.  They are thugs.  They shoot cops from behind other rioters.  They attack the weak and defensless usually in mobs with overwheming numbers.  They are human gabage.  So what is the problem?
1309224842445484032 2020-09-25 04:15:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BreitbartNews Omar is endorsed by one of the Senate candidates in Arizona.  If he wins, do you think he will support her burning down our great state?  https://t.co/6ph7iZO6mA

1309219394694733824 2020-09-25 03:53:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tedcruz True, but on the other hand if the electricity is turned off, gas pumps will not work either.  I think Newsom should start construction on bicycle and skateboard lanes in the freeway between LA and SF.
1309218688046825472 2020-09-25 03:50:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @asheborn57 @DemsH8Americans I thought that it would be best if Trump fires Wray and sends him to corrupt old @FBI directors land where Mueller and Comey exist, but I am starting to believe that Wray needs to be fired as soon as possible.
1309217900847222785 2020-09-25 03:47:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Donadeedooda Since most of BLM is white and most of Antifa is white, if there is a race war won't it be whites fighting whites mostly?  What kind of race war is that?
1309216049611460609 2020-09-25 03:40:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @QellyAnon @ronmolina @realDonaldTrump @TeamTrump @TrumpWarRoom @DonaldJTrumpJr Must be nice to just have to repeat Soros provided copy and not have to do any work or thinking on your own.
1309215603723350016 2020-09-25 03:38:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Savingworld88 @alpipkin One would think that the NYS AG would have taken a look at this a long time ago.  That is, of course, unless she is corrupt and in the bag for the Clintons.
1309214965421629440 2020-09-25 03:35:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GuyChicago5151 Watch the video closely and answer the test question.  Test - What do you do if Antifa / BLM uses their bodies to stop your car and then converges on it

1309188673603133441 2020-09-25 01:51:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @IM4IM2 Not only is it election fraud but the Democrats are trashing military ballots, the ballots of people who are risking their lives and sacrificing much to defend the country.  Can you get any more dispicable?  The people responsible need to be tried before a military tribunal.
1309187958746931201 2020-09-25 01:48:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @443777 So let me understand.  The melting Antarctic ice will put NYC, LA, &amp; Seattle underwater.  Is there a downside?
1309186919696228352 2020-09-25 01:44:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @true_pundit Well if it is extremist Right Wingers would it be OK for the police to use live ammo?

1309173228275929088 2020-09-25 00:49:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marklevinshow I guess you missed his Congressional testimony.  He is working hard to investigate white supremacists who are causing the riots since BLM is not a threat and Antifa does not exist and neither have anything to do with the swath of destruction.
1309171174857994245 2020-09-25 00:41:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ConfuzedMind @MrAndyNgo @PortlandPolice It is Portland.  Only people allowed to have live ammo is BLM, Antifa, and assorted bailed out thugs.

A strong barrier against illegal entry, crime of all sorts, money launderng, human trafficing, cartels, violence, rape and murder, and drugs.  I wonder who would work to tear down the wall we just built if elected.  Do you have any idea?  https://t.co/bh7Kbi4Zkz

1309148629962289153 2020-09-24 23:12:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Netizen11088928 @michaelahrens Indeed Democrats are starting to realize that their party has morphed into globalists, Islamists, &amp; Marxists that want to take control of the country by first destroying much of it.  Much like other Communist takeovers in the past.  Kennedy would not be a Democrat now.  #WalkAway

1309147707936776198 2020-09-24 23:08:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump Be fair.  Biden is very low energy and a walk to the potty without a shot first is a big strain.  But, I have to believe that some of the down days are because the campaign has to wait for instruction &amp; copy from Soros.  There is always the wait for the focus groups.

1309136354350174208 2020-09-24 22:23:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kramerreport You have to elect Joe Biden to find out what Joe Biden will do.
1309135943597731840 2020-09-24 22:21:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ari_russian Been reading that BLM is going around and attacking people who are eating in restaurants in FL.  This screws small business, jobs, tourism, and the quality of peoples lives.  That is what Antifa / BLM are about.  That should help put a few more points on the landslide.
1309134624241725446 2020-09-24 22:16:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal Hi Arizona  Did you know that two of Omar's opponent's staff members were gunned down in a drive by and one died?  It is how Democrats roll.  This is Minneapolis under Omar's rule and the people who endorse her.  I don't want Arizona to look like that.  I don't want Kelly.  https://t.co/ysCSPOtZCE
1309101489105891332 2020-09-24 20:04:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RightEyeGuy @FBILouisville Apparently, per Wray's order, the @FBILouisville is out hunting down white supremacists.
1309100692917882880 2020-09-24 20:01:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JTrentkemp1 Is the Antifa three arrow battalion one of the arrows in Pelosi's quiver.

1309098195671289857 2020-09-24 19:51:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ShotsRangOut @TexasSheBandit @SenSchumer Perhaps @SenSchumer had other reasons for blocking a national security briefing on election fraud.  Just throwing out a topic for consideration.
1309097292838862856 2020-09-24 19:48:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CassaniVince @tonydasit1 After radical terrorists,  Arizona should look at his Chinese friends and business partners.  His relationship with his buddy Schumer probably could be examined at some point.
1309096648732225539 2020-09-24 19:45:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @zx101z @tazmac55 Aside from the fires, the shootings of police, the riots, and general civil disobedience, the protest led by violent anti-American operatives like @lsarsour and funded by Soros was mostly peaceful.

I approve this message that someone wrote for me and I don't get because they told me to.  Anyone who disagrees is a dog faced Trump supporter.
1309093854721855488 2020-09-24 19:34:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 Did you ever think that he may be afraid to visit Portland?  Besides he has a lock on the sheeple land and has already abandoned them.
1309093530325979137 2020-09-24 19:33:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Please retweet.  The people of Arizona need to be aware of the candidate that will much hurt the state and country if elected and who is running a campaign of lies, secrets, and misrepresentations.
1309093051487444999 2020-09-24 19:31:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Good morning Arizona and America  Did you know that Omar is going to remake our wonderful state in the image of Minneapolis?  She is going to bring her brand of anti-Christian, anti-Semetic, anti-American hate to Arizona.   https://t.co/2jBp1hY9Lu  She will have help in this.  https://t.co/qe70W019fN

1308907489606459395 2020-09-24 07:13:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @vtbirkenstock @decaturlegends @Ilhan Everyone in Arizona needs to retweet this.  They may also want to ask about the $ 15,000,000 he conned the state's taxpayers out of. After that, his connections to China may be of interest. And lest we forget, he is Schumer's obedient lap dog.  Kelly will sell us out on day one.

1308902027687329792 2020-09-24 06:52:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CassandraRules I get it.  Funny, it showed up on your time line after it showed as deleted on my.  Guess it is twitters quality software.
1308900376859627520 2020-09-24 06:45:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CassandraRules I just got the message that this tweet has been deleted.  @twitter is phucking with your tweets.

1308899655816802304 2020-09-24 06:42:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CassandraRules FYI, @twitter is blocking this and won't let me retweet on my time line.

What is the chance you can get out alive and not be killed while waiting for your U-Haul?  If caught, the guy will likely be bailed out by Bloomberg so he can vote for Biden in November.
1308897748587089921 2020-09-24 06:35:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 @twitter in a reversal of its usual action removed all of the people that my wife was following but left them following her.  I think twitters, kill a conservative, AI has gone rogue and the company has lost control.
1308897015645057024 2020-09-24 06:32:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 That is true and everyone in Arizona needs to vote for McSally.  Everyone in my family will.  You left out that he conned the state out of $ 15,000,000 then laid off employees, he is in bed with China &amp; financially tied to it, and he is Schumer's lap dog.  Democrats = Death.

1308889361694576640 2020-09-24 06:01:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CindyKendrick11 My wife lost every one of the 6,000+ people she follows right after she tried to log in &amp; found her account locked with a demand that she enter her phone number &amp; then a code sent to it.  The account is at least 5 years old &amp; nothing has changed.  She still has 6,000+ followers

1308872240851714048 2020-09-24 04:53:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JennaEllisEsq My wife just lost all of her 6,000+ followers in on sweep.  It is now showing her with zero.  This happened after her account was locked until she verified her phone number.  That came out of the blue after years of being on twitter with the same number.
1308870784216174593 2020-09-24 04:48:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SteveSchmidt9 @Sarah25540235 LOL, maybe @twitters AI has gone rogue.  Twitter is crap software that mostly works some of the time.
1308870499221622791 2020-09-24 04:46:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced Geeze, who appointed that moron.  The courts are out of control.
1308869988464422914 2020-09-24 04:44:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @liquidlaugh A ten year old could stop the riots and terrorism in its tracks without breaking a sweat.  The money trail has to be wide as a NY liberal's butt and easier to follow.  The civil terror is going forward because of Democrat and Deep State (Wray is one) support.
1308868568944185349 2020-09-24 04:39:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @grindingdude That does not add up.  9,000 workers at a little over $ 2,000 each is $ 21M.  That is less than a months employment cost each.  Is it a 3 week furlough?  WTF is going on?
1308867275995443200 2020-09-24 04:34:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced @teamcombover16 Right after the report on the Biden's criminal activity hit.  You could almost script it out.  The question is, is it a NYS judge or Federal?  It would be interesting to see what court and where it will be contested.  Lawfare at it's highest level of corruption.
1308866483414609921 2020-09-24 04:31:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @thebradfordfile You left out the Ukraine.  They colluded with that country too.  If Biden engaged in such overt criminal activity as VP, imagine what he would do as President.
1308858559875219457 2020-09-24 03:59:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ScottAdamsSays @Patrici15767099 You are comparing the Steele Dossier, put together by Clinton + @DNC funding, based on rumor from Russian Agents as captured by someone who wanted to hurt Trump, and quickly identified as tripe to the product of the Senate Homeland Security Committed &amp; is well documented.  Bull!
1308856148607545346 2020-09-24 03:49:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MonmouthPoll @Donadeedooda @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Another Bull Shit poll.  There is no way 70% of voters says Biden respects the military.  I'd give it a rough 35% and they are the Democrat mindless sheeple.
1308854430218047490 2020-09-24 03:43:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @indie_american @Julio_Rosas11 Remember Wray runs the @FBI, nothing will be done about the Democrat shock trooper mob.

1308853509119455235 2020-09-24 03:39:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KarluskaP @MAGA2ARIGHTS Clearly this is organized and being funded.  You do not need shields for a non violent protest.  So much for spontaneous grass roots.  It is time that people are arrested and jailed for violently attacking property, people, and the country itself.  Democrat mob rule.

Omar is a racist, anti Christian, anti Semitic, hater of all things American.  I could go on, but that is a good beginning.  Do you know who ENDORSED her for Congress?  John Kelly.

He said he is going to freeze deportations for the first 100 days of his CAMPAIGN.    WTF?  Guy can't even read the teleprompter and has no sense of what he is saying.  His campaign?

1308805193576796162 2020-09-24 00:27:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ColSDM @DoingRight1 So what did the Moscow Russian Putin buddy's wife pay Hunter Biden for?  Did Joe get a cut?  Looks like the @TheJusticeDept &amp; @FBI missed a big one.  I wonder how that happened.   Maybe Obama / Biden / Clinton need be investigated for the real Russian Collusion.
1308804339352236037 2020-09-24 00:24:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kksheld @RavenRantz Didn't Big Pharma pay the Democrats big money to keep Hydroxychloroquine from the American people?  You want to die You want your spouse to die You want your kids to die Your friends Your neighbors You want Americans to die  Then vote for the Democrat guy (or gal).
1308801736782438401 2020-09-24 00:13:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @thejtlewis @jimbrown1964 Apparently the @DNC has just placed an order to China for more pre completed ballots.

Are there other countries that had Biden on the take?

1308780513784508416 2020-09-23 22:49:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @svagdis @AZGOP He is also pretty dirty with questionable business practices.     https://t.co/QOnuc4AXRN  The middle discusses his company's relationship with China.  It also details how his company took the Arizona taxpayers for $15,000,000 and then laid off employees.  Another lying Democrat.
1308762706602729477 2020-09-23 21:38:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Also be aware that Kelly has substantial financial ties to China.  Will he represent the US &amp; us or himself in dealings?  Kelly is Schumer's lapdog.  He would be a disaster in the Senate.  Who would he represent there.  Please take a close look at him before you vote.  Thank you

The Democrats are threatening riots and mayhem to get their way and are openly working to take down the country and all of us with it.  Now here is Kelly endorsing one of them most corrupt haters in gov't and he wants to be our Senator.  I say no.

1308550087048486913 2020-09-23 07:33:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SpeakerPelosi I thought it was $200,000,000.  Are you calling Biden a liar?  PS - What is the real number? How many died after your tour of China Town in SF? How many helpless elderly in nursing homes were killed by Democrat Governors? What happened to the $ 1,000,000,000 Newsom sent to China?

Kelly has endorsed the most anti American, anti Christian, anit Semetic, hateful, destroy America candidate running for office.  He is a lapdog of Schumer &amp; will follow his orders if elected.  He is also in deep with China, not our friend.  He is not Arizona  https://t.co/aamHjECAQC

The people of Arizona need to understand who Kelly is &amp; what he will do to the state &amp; country if elected.  Everyone in Arizona needs to know that Kelly is on the AOC, Omar team and decide if they want that.

1308176729182056449 2020-09-22 06:50:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KamalaHarris PS - The best thing that can be done to bring back racial justice &amp; togetherness, civil justice, peace, prosperity, and quality health care is to dump every Democrat possible.  I am still seething about how Gruber Driven &amp; Pelosi passed Obamacare phucked me and many others over.
1308175689980375040 2020-09-22 06:46:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KamalaHarris The American people choose a president, Trump.  He will nominate a justice and the Senate will confirm.  That is how it works.  Then the people will have a court that will make non agenda driven decisions that conform to the constitution.

1308038912518967298 2020-09-21 21:42:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bansisharma @Macoman4u1 I wonder how much of the election, the Democrat attack on Trump and America, is tied into this?
1308038595379302401 2020-09-21 21:41:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @Purrfections5 I would say to Federal Employees, if Biden is elected then the economy will go down the tubes.  Who will pay the taxes to fund your salaries and who will pay off the unfunded liablities in your pension and medical plans?  Look at Democrat run cities like NYC or states like CA.
1308035993598005248 2020-09-21 21:30:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ambertamblyn Hahahahaha  I nominate you for the Oscar in the category of overdramatic Karen BS.  I am looking forward to no words from you.
1308030852102631427 2020-09-21 21:10:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Proven_Right And they would rule America.
1308030301038194688 2020-09-21 21:08:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit Dear America  They are coming for you.
1308028416164204545 2020-09-21 21:00:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 Til now she has only used it to stir her Martinis.
1308028083748835330 2020-09-21 20:59:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LLinWood I don't get the tech companies.  Do they have a fall back position if they lose the election?  Because on 11/04 there will be no protection for them.
1308027152147775488 2020-09-21 20:55:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @may_talcott FYI, @twitter is blocking comments to this tweet on my timeline.  Here is my view.  I said No simply because they know the optics of the action and that the impeachment will be sh!t canned in the Senate.  This is just BS for the frothing not to bright sheeple Democrat base.
1308026118478258178 2020-09-21 20:51:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenSchumer @AOC Dear @SenSchumer   Tell me why I should give a rats a$$ about Ginsburg's "reputed" last wish?  Dems are united in fighting for the ability to steal the election by every fraudulent arrow in their quiver.  An honest SCOTUS would be an impediment.  That is what you care all about.
1308024520066777088 2020-09-21 20:45:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LABeachGal1 Perhaps there is a second aim and that is to support the results of election fraud.  Fake polls will be used to give credibility to the results of Democrat cheating.
1308015098707898369 2020-09-21 20:07:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LABeachGal1 A poll says that, not voters.  We have learned much over the last few years.  One key thing is that the polls are pure BS .  They are manipulated propaganda pieces designed to effect opinion, not reflect it.
1307860238435901441 2020-09-21 09:52:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mallen2010 @thehill Democrats + @Mittromney will vote against her.  They do not need a legitimate reason.  The lefts campaign strategy is built around election fraud and lawfare, so having an honest jurist would really hurt them.
1307859746527932416 2020-09-21 09:50:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GordonGChang Commonality.  If you remember the @Project_Veritas videos taken of Bernie staff, they described how they wanted to build gulags and re-educate Americans of different political view.  These people are now staffing the Biden campaign.  So the inhuman evil even lives among us.
1307856825262374917 2020-09-21 09:39:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EricTrump Only if they listen to the talk.  I think not listening to Biden increases your survival chances.
1307856335468257281 2020-09-21 09:37:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @newtgingrich @FoxNews Don't forget, you can't say "Soros".
1307855607253225473 2020-09-21 09:34:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AOC To vote early, in person, and against every Democrat running.
1307841062359068672 2020-09-21 08:36:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bansisharma That came up a while back and as I remember there is no hard and fast answer.  It depends on the state and some accept the vote and some don't.  At least that is how I remember it.
1307840731076198400 2020-09-21 08:35:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GDeCoast @liquidlaugh @TheDemocrats You bet.  It has been four+ years of insults, lies, and threats and I am much tired of it.  I have reached the point where I cannot stand anything Democrat; just nasty and evil.
1307816641321996289 2020-09-21 06:59:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cjtruth @strongmind_love @thehill needs to stop doing their polls at Biden headquarters.
1307816005129789440 2020-09-21 06:56:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CHIZMAGA @DaveErwin14 All that leaves are a few illegals in California.
1307813618969243649 2020-09-21 06:47:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Trader442 @may_talcott @Jennyjen010 @MittRomney is dirty using his position to duck the law.
1307812078938279936 2020-09-21 06:41:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LedfordPatti Schnauzers and Mutts.
1307805174702854144 2020-09-21 06:13:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PeckPolitics We need a SCOTUS without another Roberts.  My understanding is that Lagoa has strong ties to the Bush family.  That is a non starter for me and any real conservative.  If I am wrong about the Bush tie in, let me know.  It is what I have seen various people state.
1307803573682540544 2020-09-21 06:07:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Ajax2847 Rack up another life for the leftist thugs.
1307803373412864000 2020-09-21 06:06:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KRoadhog @BarryHart7 Has the Zombie mayor of Chicago announced a plan to keep the mail moving in her city?  "Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds."  The Chicago thugs have done what snow, heat, or gloom could not.
1307798065491841024 2020-09-21 05:45:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced @CountryPhy To a Democrat, fulfilling constitutional duties is a High Crime and Misdemeanor both.  She is just shooting her yap.  She knows well that any Impeachment at this point will not even be considered by the Senate.  Just noise for the sheeple.
1307796981863964672 2020-09-21 05:41:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @clairecmc Trump is not an elite.  Trump has a lot of money and enjoys it.  If you can't tell the difference then you are a bleating sheeple.
1307768096292106240 2020-09-21 03:46:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CHIZMAGA Indeed there is.   His name is election fraud and his running mate is ballot harvesting.
1307750448078569473 2020-09-21 02:36:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TrumpRulzz It is clear that every Democrat must be voted out of office.  My thought is that any articles delivered to the Senate will be tossed in the can post haste.  Pelosi is just shooting off her mouth for the frothing sheeple of hate; her base.
1307737387326271488 2020-09-21 01:44:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SteveGuest @realDonaldTrump LOL, just a stupid threat.  Pelosi &amp; Stephanopoulos both knows that an Impeachment based on the high crime and misdemeanor of "Because we Can" will hit the circular can the minute it arrives at the Senate.  There will be no Senate procedings.
1307735357450932224 2020-09-21 01:36:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BeauWillimon Who is the we that will be engaged in domestic terror?
1307720538828103680 2020-09-21 00:37:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PlaysTrumpCard @WvTrump @TrumpWarRoom @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Well that would be interesting.  The Democrats would pull another one party impeachment based on the fact that Trump is doing his job.  Still, there would be no reason that the Senate could not fill the seat while the Democrat Power Grab and Clown Show went on.
1307692390732369920 2020-09-20 22:45:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JonathanTurley @robdetf Wow, you know what Chuck Todd has said.  What a complete waste of time.
1307678317214969857 2020-09-20 21:49:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DawnVLion @zx101z @UsaZ06 I did not know either, but a supporter of hers tweeted it out as if it were a recommendation.
1307674075003719680 2020-09-20 21:32:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @babysgramma No thanks.  Aren't you what @LouDobbs calls the Chamber of Horrors because you have sold out America and American Jobs for cheap foreign labor?  Seems like @lisamurkowski,  who has betrayed the country and party &amp; just said she will do it again, is a good match for you.
1307672253383933952 2020-09-20 21:25:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SpringSteps @jaketapper @CNNPolitics And the mob is in DC.

1307665826045022208 2020-09-20 21:00:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @zx101z @UsaZ06 Sorry don't want Lagoa, she has ties to the Bush family.  One thing we do not need is another Roberts on SCOTUS.
1307665295079690240 2020-09-20 20:57:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @yogagenie @Vlatka21 @realDonaldTrump @JesseBWatters My Senator is McSally and she will do the job.  @SenMcSallyAZ .  She will also get all of my family's votes.
1307664966250426371 2020-09-20 20:56:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NBSaphierMD @MiddleClazzMom There are a lot of red states that would love to have you and would value a new Doc greatly.
1307663091430170625 2020-09-20 20:49:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @j_gelling @JamesCanby Sorry, anything tied to the Bush family stinks like a five day old dead fish rotting in a hot sun.  Most have had enough of the globalist skum sucking RINOs.
1307662386145288192 2020-09-20 20:46:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> Would @twitter care to explain how it counts likes &amp; retweets.  I was at 110 likes an hour ago on a tweet, 99 a half hour ago, got 15 likes in the last half hour, and am still at 99 likes.  Is it that twitter's AI can't count or is it rigging the system?
1307660427514408967 2020-09-20 20:38:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ConservaMomUSA @RBruceAllRighty @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I would title this, things that MSM will never show you.
1307659297451511809 2020-09-20 20:34:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RL9631 Go Martha  To Arizona, my state.  McSally has my vote &amp; that of everyone in my family.  For two reasons.  First, she has done a good job &amp; represented conservative values.  Second, Kelly has a significant financial interest in China, big bucks, and second he is a Schumer puppet.
1307658349094215680 2020-09-20 20:30:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @stillgray @Love_Chihuahua Imagine the uproar when Soros kicks it.
1307656528724287488 2020-09-20 20:23:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @brianefallon Act in what way?  What are you proposing that the Democrats do?  Another threat?
1307655476398620673 2020-09-20 20:18:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenBlumenthal I think that there may be riots in Portland with people in masks running around with Molotov Cocktails and blinding industrial lasers together with rocks, bricks, clubs, bottles of urine and feces, and so on if there is a SCOTUS vote.
1307654872561410048 2020-09-20 20:16:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @superyayadize @Sundncefn @RepAOC @POTUS @cummings2020 She needs who to be ready?  She needs whoever to be ready for what?  Is this another threat from the radical left?

1307653047435182080 2020-09-20 20:09:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RoyaleCheyanne @InkedUpLadyy @tedwheeler @PortlandAudubon I will block you.  That is consistant with my policy of shunning hateful lying leftist morons.  Nothing personal.  Bye @RoyaleCheyanne
1307651909113712642 2020-09-20 20:04:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Pickledfins @tedwheeler @PortlandAudubon For sure.
1307490999489294336 2020-09-20 09:25:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tedwheeler @PortlandAudubon So Portland is going to be a dark place with masked people in black clothes running around with their Molotov cocktails at the ready.
1307478163929198593 2020-09-20 08:34:20 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Virgingersnap17 @acadianbelle @JajsaArthur It just hit me as I was shutting down my computer that the rational of @SenSusanCollins campaign is, vote for me because I am not as big a scumbag as the other candidate.  Sad, sad, sad.
1307477190888415232 2020-09-20 08:30:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DoniTheDon_ @KevinJWatt1 Wow, she is from California.
1307476025614299136 2020-09-20 08:25:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenBlumenthal WTF does that mean.  What exactly are you threatening the American people with?
1307475714258526208 2020-09-20 08:24:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @IlhanMN I thought you were to busy shooting up your opponents staff to get involved in this.
1307475168571174914 2020-09-20 08:22:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Virgingersnap17 @acadianbelle @JajsaArthur Perhaps, but if she pulls that crap the conservatives may not turn out or be able to stomach her and the greater of two evils will be elected.
1307451426835107840 2020-09-20 06:48:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @American1299 Guess what.  I clicked on the link to contact her.   Filled out the form, entered my comment, hit submit, and nothing happened.  @SenSusanCollins  is a loser and is contemptuous of voters.  I do not see how any conservative can vote for her.
1307448867906924544 2020-09-20 06:37:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit @JajsaArthur It is always the same three scumbags.  Collins, Murkowski, and Romney.  Hopefully there will be a big enough majority in November so that they no longer matter.  Why would any conservative vote for Collins?
1307448113217417216 2020-09-20 06:34:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @acadianbelle @JajsaArthur My question is why would any conservative vote for Collins in November?
1307447980589424641 2020-09-20 06:34:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Lilpoo404 Yes.  And  Schumer will do whatever Soros tells him to do.
1307444636911202304 2020-09-20 06:21:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mspdcali @Clark2June The conservatives of her state need tell her what they think of her.

He enjoyed stripping the bodies of his fellow Germans and he would love to do so to us.  How does he get away with it?  He owns the Democrat Party and many RINOs.  https://t.co/oUSLXJqdzt
1307413773615996928 2020-09-20 04:18:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KevinJWatt1 Hey Democrat government by mob.  These are the people that want to "rule" the country and run your life.

They have nothing but "value" based lies and BS.  I shun them and they have no power.  Joke is, he is probably a Soros funded fake account.
1307411698525954048 2020-09-20 04:10:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 LOL, Joe Manchin cancels out @MittRomney .  Utah really needs to find a way to recall and dump Romney.
1307411231800569856 2020-09-20 04:08:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @indiekid3090 @HypocrisyMatte1 @LEBassett Well, well, a 7 follower fake account calling someone an anti-Semite.  Looks like the shills are all out today.  Soros particpated in the herding of Jewish (and others into death camps), stripped their possesions for the Nazi good, and said he had a good time doing it.  Block.

1307351245582082049 2020-09-20 00:10:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mad_liberals @KimInTulsa Even beyond that.  The Democrats are asking for your vote so that they can assume the power of government while threating to riot and burn down the country if they disagree with an action of the President.
1307350088562348038 2020-09-20 00:05:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @politicalfarm @EinsteinsMagic He needs to follow up with a statement addressing Democrat threats to riot and burn down the country if the president does what he says the president should do.

1307326487926722562 2020-09-19 22:31:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KelemenCari @OldcorpsGrunt Sad but true.

1307325875776495616 2020-09-19 22:29:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @nickj1312 @LEBassett That is exactly how Democrat / Marxist led riots funded by Soros and other Elitists work.

1307288721306185729 2020-09-19 20:01:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LEBassett So we should govern through fear of leftist mobs?  Any idea who will be funding and coordinating the riots?
1307286022326165504 2020-09-19 19:50:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 LOL
1307284234915123200 2020-09-19 19:43:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JimDabakis How much harm has Utah done to America by electing @MittRomney ?
1307280747292581888 2020-09-19 19:29:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump Yes
1307129794325368833 2020-09-19 09:30:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LEBassett Good.  Think they will burn down Portland?

1307032248776970240 2020-09-19 03:02:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joshdcaplan Any company with a big stake in China which is dependent on the good will of the #CCP, needs Biden to allow their pursuits to continue.  In other words, Google is supporting China in it's surveillance and other crap for big bucks and wants Biden to keep the gov't out of the way.

1307011770649735168 2020-09-19 01:41:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @catturd2 @vivelafra The Democrats / Marxists and their synchopants (paid or otherwise) are telling America, in your face, that they are going to win by election fraud and there is nothing you can do about it  Democrat election fraud means that I have no representation in government.  Not acceptable!
1307002924849979392 2020-09-19 01:05:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Dr_Hoggie @Savingworld88 @UsaZ06 I was saterizing Biden's you are not Black slur.  Indeed the death and starvation that followed Communist takeovers in Cuba and Venezuela are horrible.  Teachers likely do not teach about the Chinese Famine that killed 10 MILLION ten years after the #CCP take over.

Now there is someone with a pile of bodies   How many deaths is Soros responsible for?  Cuomo?  Now do the #CCP and Xi.  Democrats are death. Democrats are hypocrites

1306686065479041024 2020-09-18 04:06:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EvanAKilgore Ever think that BLM may have been involved?

1306409899039973378 2020-09-17 09:49:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Emmita17E @gatewaypundit The Milwaukee Police denied a person the right of self defense against a mob besieging his home.  He should sue them once, twice, and a 100 times more.  Someone should tell the police in Milwaukee their job is not to protect a trespassing threating mob.

A few corrupt mayors arrested will do a lot to stop the riots.  So, if true, why not the Barnacle on the Butt of Portland, @tedwheeler ?  The Chicago Zombie is getting a lot of people killed.  And on and on and on, every Democrat mayor.

I don't think, in any case, the truth was lost in his presentation.
1306228740062494720 2020-09-16 21:49:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @USAHipster Of course he sees dead people and they love him.  Many will be voting for him in November.

1305986238969597952 2020-09-16 05:45:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SpeakerPelosi @DHSOIG So if it is legal to shit in the street in SF, how come the guy who took a dump in your driveway was arrested?  Do you have a special white privilege reserved for wired in  Democrats?  Just asking so I can decide for November.
1305985350355972096 2020-09-16 05:42:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced Any Jew who votes Democrat is a traitor to their heritage, their Religion, and their God.  They have embraced evil for pieces of silver.  Right @JerryNadler ?   Right @SenSchumer ? Right @AdamSchiff ?  Boy, looking at those three would make any God loving Jew shake their head.
1305984643225714693 2020-09-16 05:39:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 @PageSix Wow, and they were such a cute couple.
1305984389768118272 2020-09-16 05:38:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DougIbendahl Scary thing is, his comment was likely scripted and on a telepromter and this is what came out.
1305983507504574464 2020-09-16 05:35:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DavidJHarrisJr @ari4tru Like Bill Maher saying he would welcome a recession if it would hurt Trump.  The Democrat elite are willing to screw you, me, and everyone else to the wall to keep control.
1305982845291094016 2020-09-16 05:32:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DonaldJTrumpJr C'mon man  We all know that he is in it to keep himself and his family out of jail for selling out the US on a massive scale.  Harris will be president and the deal is to protect the Biden coven.
1305982061266698241 2020-09-16 05:29:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JazzJT @deepcow Nah, useful idiots are a dime a dozen.  Cheaper to let them rot and bus in a new crew.  If they get arrested, then wash, rinse, and do again.
1305981261081579520 2020-09-16 05:26:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @charliekirk11 @Chitt_Happpens She has no intention of being Vice President.
1305981057833922566 2020-09-16 05:25:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Chitt_Happpens Hard to believe she has a degree from Berkeley.  Just kidding, she did not have the money to buy one.
1305978791844429825 2020-09-16 05:16:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @vicksiern I said the same because I was a big supporter from day one.
1305977812088573953 2020-09-16 05:12:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joshdcaplan So what is he going to do with it?
1305960333014495233 2020-09-16 04:03:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DianeLong22 @NightWatchNorm Gratz, Mayor Young.  You beat the Chicago Zombie Mayor last week.
1305959031534579713 2020-09-16 03:57:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DonaldJTrumpJr @asyoureadthis If he is using a teleprompter in interviews, that means someone is feeding him the responses in real time.
1305958729637003264 2020-09-16 03:56:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bryan700 Isn't that the line of the female Democrat House Reps waiting to get into the State of the Union Address?
1305958280141746177 2020-09-16 03:54:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @deepcow Wow, BLM is going to have to launder a lot more into the Biden campaign to bail out its soldiers.
1305958041536192512 2020-09-16 03:53:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Ajax2847 At least @JerryNadler comes out clean since he never heard of Antifa.
1305957565809917952 2020-09-16 03:52:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cvpayne @ResidentOfFL And yet some are going to vote for Basement Joe.  Go figure.
1305957078909943809 2020-09-16 03:50:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @johnraiders25 @jhpadillaleal @joshdcaplan True.
1305956942485970944 2020-09-16 03:49:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LionTedPride Lots of ways, for example Planned Parenthood makes a ton killing children.  But the real profit comes from controlling a segment of society through fear and lies and hence controlling the strings of power.  A good part of the Democrat campaign centers around the Chinese Plague.
1305955432247128064 2020-09-16 03:43:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DailyPamphlet @markknoller Clearly, even though there is no fire bombing, looting, or beating of innocent people, the two real give aways that this is not an Antifa / BLM riot are that there are no masks hiding the perps identities and the pictured was not taken in Portland.
1305934524866424832 2020-09-16 02:20:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LionTedPride Democrats profit from death.  What is new?
1305934378514542592 2020-09-16 02:19:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SmilelyLoriLynn @LionTedPride @POTUS 👏👏👏👏👏  Well done to all.  And here is a wish for peace for the people in the ME.  It has been a long time coming.
1305933873075769344 2020-09-16 02:17:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @markknoller Oh Noez!!!!  Impeach, impeach, impeach.  Oh Noez!!!!  Do you think anyone, other than the terminally stupid, really buys the Democrat Face Mask Bull?
1305929911249428482 2020-09-16 02:02:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @liquidlaugh @GOPWarLord Wow, he is almost doing as good as Hillary.

Same Soros funded person.  Makes you wonder.  Anyway bye, bye, banned and shunned little pie.
1305928611644407808 2020-09-16 01:56:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @robbystarbuck @sciam Hahahaha  Scientific American is owned by the Germans.  Why don't they call it Scientific Germany?
1305928386154434560 2020-09-16 01:56:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sciam What a crock.  You guys are giving science a bad name.
1305928073485807618 2020-09-16 01:54:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sciam Watz up.  Revenue down?  You going for that good Chinese money?
1305927748108443648 2020-09-16 01:53:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gr8tjude_08 Apparently Biden is going to try to convince the Cubans in FL that if elected he will not go to Cuba and suck up to the Communist dictators like Obama did.
1305926631421140993 2020-09-16 01:49:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Nick_Clamorgan @javelinsst1972 The NFL is dead.  How did Harris get along with Blake's anti-semetic, racist family when she went to console them?
1305926210745110529 2020-09-16 01:47:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @davidwebbshow @lady_pilgrim Strangely, the lab with the discovery notes, samples, and scientists blew up last night (oops will be tonight).  BIG PHARMA will send its condolences.
1305925064269819904 2020-09-16 01:42:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MariaBonanno9 @KevinJWatt1 Go to Portland where the rioting, arson, and violence is valued.  They also allow looting, what could be better?
1305924616636907520 2020-09-16 01:41:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joshdcaplan Of course they were all postmarked Shanghai China.
1305924416170156032 2020-09-16 01:40:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cvpayne @SpeakerPelosi will make a statement that bringing peace to the Middle East is just a ploy to get votes and that her party would never do such a thing.
1305924129472696320 2020-09-16 01:39:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced 👏👏👏👏👏
1305924034090033152 2020-09-16 01:38:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jhpadillaleal @joshdcaplan You bet.  Since when is the waving the American Flag or supporting the police a political statement.  Is the school administrator afraid to offend the people who hate the country and want to see cops killed?
1305923591783854080 2020-09-16 01:37:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 @gatewaypundit Well at least he is getting a turn out.  If his "handlers" don't tell him, he may think the people are his supporters and enjoy the attention.
1305923172475129856 2020-09-16 01:35:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Squirrelymom24 @allenskillicorn @TomWolfPA PS - I ban 38 follower fake accounts that are simply BS spewers.  Bye.
1305922982661902341 2020-09-16 01:34:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Squirrelymom24 @allenskillicorn @TomWolfPA C'mon man/woman or thing.  Everyone knows that it is the Democrats that use the law as a weapon against defenseless people and at the forefront of  legislation from the bench is the skummy crew that Obama put in.  To your crew, the law means nothing &amp; the narrative everything.
1305875273733169154 2020-09-15 22:25:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @exjon Joe is not running to be President.  He is running to keep himself and his family out of jail.  So he will gladly step aside if mission accomplished.
1305874502966939648 2020-09-15 22:21:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CraigAr64 @USAloveGOD His name will be on the football player's helmets this Sunday.

1305874058488066049 2020-09-15 22:20:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Samhaine4 True?
1305873902552326145 2020-09-15 22:19:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrAndyNgo Wow, they could do the Adam's Family without makeup.
1305873648876617728 2020-09-15 22:18:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @sandyleevincent @SAndricsak @realDonaldTrump Every time Biden or John Kelly (I am in AZ) talk about how they are going to "save" medical care, I think about Obamacare from which the country may never recover.
1305873145421651968 2020-09-15 22:16:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BuCap004 @BMcCodeOvets125 Just when you conclude the real business of @Netflix is to launder money for the Obama cartel, in walk the Pedos.
1305872365339934720 2020-09-15 22:13:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @allenskillicorn The governor of Pennsylvania (@TomWolfPA ) is vigorously shopping for an Obama appointed judge to bring an appeal.
1305872076159488001 2020-09-15 22:12:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BreitbartNews Any comment @Disney?
1305871673074356225 2020-09-15 22:10:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cvpayne @DemsH8Americans You bet.  Luck to her in her journey.
1305871424683421696 2020-09-15 22:09:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 @gatewaypundit Hey leftist shills and especially the governers lying to the citizens of your states.  Any explanation of this?
1305842240309268481 2020-09-15 20:13:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 @Hootentown2 True?
1305840259268141059 2020-09-15 20:05:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Jkruge Raise your hand if you think there will be a debate.
1305838887852408832 2020-09-15 20:00:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PrisonPlanet No Democrats in China
1305838745875181569 2020-09-15 19:59:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GeorgePapa19 Different climate.
1305837325662920710 2020-09-15 19:54:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods @WilliamMillen5 That never happens in the cartoons he watches.

1305836213597691904 2020-09-15 19:49:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @swampbuggyguy @brandondarby He also failed to back up once he heard the thump.
1305835952011489281 2020-09-15 19:48:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gusbova @brandondarby Give time for a shooter to close in?  I don't think so
1305835178632204288 2020-09-15 19:45:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KiousErica @may_talcott LOL, that would be something.

1305833715365363714 2020-09-15 19:39:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DavidWinterTV Since when is the American Flag and support for police a political point of view.
1305832016831606784 2020-09-15 19:33:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump Why don't you ask @JohnKerry .    I am sure he would know.
1305687351608311809 2020-09-15 09:58:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @1776Stonewall Bye, bye illegal pie .
1305687139783290880 2020-09-15 09:57:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Crossbearer1956 So we can toss the Bill gates vaccine.
1305685764038995968 2020-09-15 09:51:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @redwins3_first @Ajax2847 Hahahahahahaha  Is there enough election fraud in the world to save Biden?
1305630720698638338 2020-09-15 06:13:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lklfaith @Hootentown2 To the truth Biden is in a world far away, but I must say the people controlling him are not that good.   That is pure crap.
1305625177057710081 2020-09-15 05:51:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 @DailyCaller Sorry, @TheJusticeDept is useless.
1305624921771397120 2020-09-15 05:50:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joshdcaplan Don't t be alarmed.  The Biden campaign will have him out on bail with fresh matches in no time.
1305624491532234752 2020-09-15 05:48:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump Welcome!
1305624382497144833 2020-09-15 05:48:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto NO!!!!!
1305623405928968192 2020-09-15 05:44:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChadoftheChaz It's OK he has Obamacare.
1305622354207207424 2020-09-15 05:40:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @seanhannity Did I miss something.  I thought the perp used a handgun.
1305621647596990464 2020-09-15 05:37:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BreitbartNews I think, not positive, that Baltimore won the death game last weekend.
1305618872532262913 2020-09-15 05:26:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WarTimeGirl @gardenofthegods @JoeBiden Hard to be sure, but I think that the bug that bit him during his speech died before he swatted it.
1305618457619132416 2020-09-15 05:24:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods @flatwalk At this point, the entire Democrat game plan is election fraud.
1305618032136392705 2020-09-15 05:22:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @no_silenced @JajsaArthur If that is the case, can't the people of the state sue him?
1305616729368739840 2020-09-15 05:17:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @feingold32 It could have been worse.  The cop could have shot him through the roof.  That would have worked for me.  I have bad news for the Democrats and Deep State if they plan to lauch their coup using these people as their military.
1305615500471279617 2020-09-15 05:12:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RyanAFournier Just a heads up.  @twitter will not let me retweet this from my time line.  They are screwing with your tweets.
1305614158453383169 2020-09-15 05:07:27 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec "Somewhere in America there is a field that Antifa has not torched."
1305613477948485633 2020-09-15 05:04:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GavinNewsom I would not believe anything you or your auntie Nancy said if you paid me in Chinese Currency.
1305612110051778560 2020-09-15 04:59:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @snyder1_r @MarkDice It is really sad, because in the end they will have spent their one God given life as an empty vessel.  I "did" my college and post grad a number of years before the education system became a money grubbing con.  I would not give that up for anything.
1305611134544699392 2020-09-15 04:55:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GardnerKatyg8 @FloridaDude297 @may_talcott LOL, no problem, but a little push never hurt and hopefully some people will start thinking.  A lot of the liberal elites are feeling the pain and are starting to realize that the Marxist two headed beast of Antifa / BLM will come for them in due time as well.
1305596960141791232 2020-09-15 03:59:06 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MarkDice Democrat mayor, Democrat run.  Let them burn it down and then live in it.    I am sorry to seem cold, but they are getting old.
1305595799145906177 2020-09-15 03:54:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @deeth_jim Wow, he outdid the Zombie Mayor of Chicago.
1305595321473327104 2020-09-15 03:52:36 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AngelWarrior321 @RoseDC11 Move the floats to Miami and do it right.
1305594982477094912 2020-09-15 03:51:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @stephbusy @DineshDSouza @kennedyforex I am sure with enough training the cop could have shot the knife out of his hand with the bullet only touching knife and not harming the crazed charging perp.  Geeze, are you that stupid?
1305594408797003776 2020-09-15 03:48:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CovfefeKatie And America would have one less social worker.  The irony is that there would be no one to stop the crazed purp as he ravaged his neighborhood.  What would the Marxists Democrats do?  Send another social worker?
1305593531440922625 2020-09-15 03:45:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Crossbearer1956 @amlookout Indeed, the Democrats and MSM have over did it for much to long.  Neither have any credibility.    As a matter of fact, their screaming and shrill whines are a definite turn off.
1305592675182075904 2020-09-15 03:42:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Robin49510082 @Trey_VonDinkis The constitution is the original law on the books.  I would say to cops that no Mayor or other official who gives orders contray to should be obeyed.  Following orders did not hold up at the end of WWII and it does not hold up now.  I support the police.
1305591464353644546 2020-09-15 03:37:16 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GardnerKatyg8 @FloridaDude297 @may_talcott Considering a liberal county, the results are closer than expected.  I would ask the people there to think and consider if they are traditional Kennedy liberals, mainstream, or burn it down Marxist liberals.  It may be that the Republican candidate actually better reflects them.
1305565838968147970 2020-09-15 01:55:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LaurenWitzkeDE @M35620522Jackie @JoeBiden @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Look at the bright side, in a lot of places little girls like her are shot or abducted by leftist thugs.  Keep your children close and your weapon oiled, because they are coming.

1305563948465283072 2020-09-15 01:47:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Trey_VonDinkis What do Democrat governers care about the Constitution?  It is up to the police to not enforce those orders.

1305525940412280832 2020-09-14 23:16:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrAndyNgo Those fires, reported by the MSM as the result of global warming, were quickly put out.  The Oregon Democrat leadership blamed the arson on Trump.
1305525187778023425 2020-09-14 23:13:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @thebradfordfile It is starting to look that way.  Much a long shot, but wouldn't that be incredible.  Then let the rebuilding of the country begin in earnest with the left gone.
1305524149364772869 2020-09-14 23:09:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Francis_Marion @PolyPatriot @KurtSchlichter @lisaturnerdecor Not sure where this happened.  If in a Democrat run city, self defense and protection of the weak against Antifa / BLM thugs is a crime..  Likely the only crime a Soros paid DA will prosecute.
1305523520026284036 2020-09-14 23:07:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tbone9070 @FoxNews If you worked at @FoxNews you would be sucking on Ryan for every penny you could get as the station sprials down the @CNN whirlpool of a flushed toilet.  Other than a few good people, many on Fox Business, those at Fox are more in the Donna / Juan mold.

Thug shot to death, city with a Democrat mayor &amp; city council goes into riot overdrive, &amp; yawn.  I did not have to check, but Lancaster PA is another slice of Democrat Paradise.     https://t.co/Ho5XnqfFnG  Go ahead torch your town.

1305279786743296000 2020-09-14 06:58:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @robreiner Don't tell me, I think that you are a moron.  Why don't you zip a note to @AdamSchiff and ask for an investigation or one to @SpeakerPelosi and ask for yet another impeachment vote.  @JerryNadler is a possibility although he is out pondering whether Antifa exists or not.
1305278667598123009 2020-09-14 06:54:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @stillgray This is the Democrat militant hate arm that is supposed to take over the country.  Every vote for a Democrat on any level is a vote for one of those scumbags.

You don't have to give people a reason to vote for you and ask for their vote, you just get the leftist paid thugs to produce as many mail in ballots as they can.

So which is it, President for ALL AMERICANS or Not your president or does it just depend which argument you are making at the moment?

1304581315337940992 2020-09-12 08:43:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joshdcaplan I was hoping for more.
1304575700670709760 2020-09-12 08:20:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit Wow, arsonists burning down Oregon.  Who would have seen that coming?  Oh well, put the Global Warming BS back on the shelf for the time being.
1304518504939282432 2020-09-12 04:33:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gardenofthegods He look its goat girl. Goat girl is rich.  Daddy has a condo in NYC &amp; an estate in Conn. Goat girl is a BLM/Antifa terrorist Goat girl's daddy is a child psychologist who teaches the elites how to raise their children When NY burns to ash, goat girl will go to Conn. And so it is.
1304516117088542720 2020-09-12 04:24:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @missnormagene @thebradfordfile @buda102462 @Comey And Rod the Weasel Rosenstein appointed him.
1304514474389327872 2020-09-12 04:17:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @theblaze @toby_dorena Oh well, she can always sign on as an Antifa medic in Portland.
1304514284991455232 2020-09-12 04:16:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Sparty80GoGreen @KevinJWatt1 Point is, there is no law for them.  They will get away with all of their crimes.
1304513937010900992 2020-09-12 04:15:33 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 Nooooooooooooo kidding.  NYS is within striking distance.  Wow, wow, wow.
1304483888119439360 2020-09-12 02:16:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @American1299 If the moronic effort by the Democrats turns one person in the military we may as well surrender to China now.  There may be riots of sorts, but the leftist elites will tuck tail and run because they know how a coup attempt would end and fare for them.
1304482936666775552 2020-09-12 02:12:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TomFitton @JudicialWatch In response, the @FBI and @DOJ blew Grassley off, but did wish him a nice weekend.
1304482078583447553 2020-09-12 02:08:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @cvpayne @RepMarkGreen I think he was nominated for a second one.  Not joking.
1304475596685103104 2020-09-12 01:43:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @GreggJarrett @usmade1001 Wow, a mate to the Zombie of Chicago.  She appears to be the LA version of the walking dead.
1304475110619770880 2020-09-12 01:41:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @espiteau @marklevinshow You are a crock.
1304474916461465602 2020-09-12 01:40:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marklevinshow @nedryun As the Soros paid Antifa / BLM thugs climbed onto their buses for the journey to their far away homes, they paused for a second to view the town they had destroyed and the people that will have to live in the ruins.
1304473969546780673 2020-09-12 01:36:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marklevinshow @joehos18 So what gift at taxpayers expense will Joe give your for $500,000?  That is getting close to Ukraine level influence.
1304473575890382849 2020-09-12 01:35:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrAndyNgo @P8R1OT Her second grade class will miss her.  Just kidding, I don't know for sure, she just reminds me of the average teacher in Portland.
1304471959179206657 2020-09-12 01:28:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @XiJonPoohPing @zerosum24 @CanaaniteR Yeah, I have high hopes.
1304471658967625728 2020-09-12 01:27:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @zerosum24 @lady_pilgrim Looks like BLM / Antifa took a day away from burning down Portland and spent some time in the country.  Oregon was a beautiful state, God's land, before the evil left destroyed it.   This is your future under Democrat rule.  Please retweet the video before @twitter hides it.
1304439597930131456 2020-09-11 23:20:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Hoya97 @Hootentown2 @BreitbartNews As Biden's Secretary of State Rice would be able to make sure the flow of "Cuties" to the Leftist Elites is undisturbed.
1304427354383511552 2020-09-11 22:31:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MariaSMBII Hard to believe the state of massive arson in its key city of Portland as perpetrated by BLM / Antifa thugs is burning down everywhere.
1304426573240528902 2020-09-11 22:28:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 @gatewaypundit One of the rich riotous thugs daddy is a child psychologist who is being paid hugh money to tell the elite how to raise their children.  This thugette will retire to the family estate in Connecticut when NYC becomes unlivable and she can no longer live in the luxury condo there.
1304401377670512643 2020-09-11 20:48:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal @DolphinsMiami25 I am surprised that BLM &amp; DeBlasio haven't removed the one in NYC.
1304400998262214658 2020-09-11 20:46:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal @YahooNews Why does every liberal paradise end up looking like Hell?
1304381389643550723 2020-09-11 19:28:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealJamesWoods @samyky588893 @TheDemocrats Well Pelosi finally did something on the jobs front.  She put a single mother with two children out of business and pushed her employees onto unemployment.  She will be making a half coherent semi sober speach today on the House Floor blaming it on Trump.
1304233363578867712 2020-09-11 09:40:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PerspicaciousXY @stillgray From the @Netflix crew.  PS - If you have a 10 year old daughter, we are auditioning.
1304214020614840321 2020-09-11 08:23:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DebHaslam @SAndricsak Best of luck to him.
1304213840616275968 2020-09-11 08:23:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @hucklebee_sarah @gardenofthegods The Mueller team like the rest of their deep state cronies are as dirty as they come.  They are in your face, screw you, what are you going to do about it arrogant and dirty.  They are the bacteria eating away at the body of this country.
1304190057310420992 2020-09-11 06:48:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @delsocialdem @jachristian @sfchronicle Oh by the way, you can have your whine and bleat and then I will be blocking you.
1304189873838944256 2020-09-11 06:47:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @delsocialdem @jachristian @sfchronicle Its called Bull Shit and your Democrat Politicians are using it to rip off big money from the garbage movements they have started and to manipulate morons like you.  Hillary said it best.  https://t.co/iTRQpyewyW
1304189277404762112 2020-09-11 06:45:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @bodesm @BibleBeltDarlin That the NFL players are wearing the name of a rapist and glorifying the violence he visited on a defenseless woman is a bad thing.  On the other hand, very few will see it and that is a good thing.

1304166430628171778 2020-09-11 05:14:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BibleBeltDarlin Will the NFL be able to honor it's commitment to BLM?
1304165996555501569 2020-09-11 05:12:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @lukeobxx No mercy if they do.
1304163325480058880 2020-09-11 05:02:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump I can't wait to see how he blames this on you
1304153054845915137 2020-09-11 04:21:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal Much sad to hear this.
1304152810682945537 2020-09-11 04:20:34 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @American1299 OK, I give up, what is it?
1304152449008037888 2020-09-11 04:19:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Kat_4T @CaliRN619 @DailyCaller For those who were wondering why @Apple , @Nike, @Disney, etc. and many elites in need of body part replacements are against Trump, here is one of the many reasons.
1304149860531093504 2020-09-11 04:08:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AdamMilstein What a disgrace to her religion and heritage.
1304149475670126592 2020-09-11 04:07:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WVzo6 @CaliRN619 @Disney has substantial holdings in China (Shanghai Theme Park for example) and generates significant income from that country.  @Disney would also sell Mickey's mother into mouse slavery for a buck.  Put the two of the above together and you understand what is going on.
1304115269183258624 2020-09-11 01:51:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PerspicaciousXY @LionTedPride I cancelled when Rice joined and the "deals" were made with the Obamas.  The handwriting was clear then that @Netflix was a leftist group that would use its corporation to launder money to those that would destroy the country.
1304036596753154048 2020-09-10 20:38:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @captcrunch32 @realDonaldTrump That is my guess.  Anyone dining in a NY restaurant will be attacked by leftist BLM / Antifa thug mob.
1304035092361175040 2020-09-10 20:32:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bubblebathgirl Nope
1304032209347567619 2020-09-10 20:21:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @towntro No.
1304031079834083328 2020-09-10 20:16:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bubblebathgirl Is it a lie if you can't tell the difference between 6,000 and 7.  C'mon man!  You know that Biden is just saying what he is told to. Like, if elected through massive election fraud, he will run the country.
1304029356931477506 2020-09-10 20:10:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @reubing No!

1303849328474075137 2020-09-10 08:14:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealMattCouch The corporations will do well because they will continue to build overseas and keep the money out of America where it will not be taxed.  America will become a poor vassal of China, a place of mindless Marxism and hopelessness.
1303848844594016256 2020-09-10 08:12:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenSchumer Did he tell you what the majority of Americans want?  Reminds me of the old RCA ad, "His masters voice"  https://t.co/A8uoDbsdqE
1303832478583459840 2020-09-10 07:07:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DGPurser San Francisco was once the most wonderful of all cities.  I loved it well.  It took years of liberalism to destroy it.    Having turned the city into Hell on Earth, the forces of evil are moving on and want to replicate this in your area.    Do you really want to vote Democrat?
1303831517781581824 2020-09-10 07:03:52 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JoeFreedomLove Orange sky bad.  See what I did?
1303800240928034816 2020-09-10 04:59:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RepAdamSchiff Hahahaha  What a moron.
1303796899573501952 2020-09-10 04:46:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Herbert_L_Reed The Democrats are building defenses against their own mobs.  If the police are defunded, gone, who will protect them?
1303796605133271040 2020-09-10 04:45:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Feisty_FL Left out, "Laws banning sex with children".
1303795582763376640 2020-09-10 04:41:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jachristian @sfchronicle Wow, CA has indeed become Hell on Earth under the Democrats.
1303794324686041089 2020-09-10 04:36:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KentuckyGoddess I don't know.  I can't think of anything that moves a true humanitarian like Soros more than the plight of minorities and am sure he cares about them living in the burnt out cities he created.
1303793236998193152 2020-09-10 04:31:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KentuckyGoddess No kidding.  My time line if filled with leftist garbage that was supposedly liked by someone I follow.  These are people I know would never like a loser lefty.  @twitter is indeed playing games.
1303753407258193920 2020-09-10 01:53:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RealMattCouch Yeah, we may end up looking like Somalia.
1303753274806341633 2020-09-10 01:52:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joepalojoe Does Mayor Zombie have a comment?
1303751263763324928 2020-09-10 01:44:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kristikgilson My understanding is that he has an understanding with BLM that the group will attack anyone who tries to eat out.  In that way the restaurants are still effectively closed but he can blame it on Trump.  Just kidding although safe money is on that happening.
1303738731816390657 2020-09-10 00:55:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChrisMo37540912 @diva_barb I am waiting for @GavinNewsom to fine God
1303738372041502720 2020-09-10 00:53:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @StephenKing Still writing bad fiction.  This time on Twitter.  Well at least it is free.
1303737941693329408 2020-09-10 00:52:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @williamlharbuck @likely2confuse There is truth there.  Also they want to be able to operate in global markets while still ripping off America.  An example is @Disney which is making tons of money in China and selling out the US to do so.  Most large corps are like that.
1303734230921351168 2020-09-10 00:37:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @likely2confuse @williamlharbuck I think many are being extorted and trying to buy peace.

1303733749859848193 2020-09-10 00:35:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Kirk_925 @EinsteinsMagic How many of those people are school teachers that have control of your kids while they are at school?
1303732321191735298 2020-09-10 00:29:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @illumilady Depends if I brought my gun with me.
1303709123981189122 2020-09-09 22:57:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @drsimonegold @WingsofCrystal There are three reasons why Covid-19 has not ravished Africa.  1 Availability of Hydroxychloroquine, i.e. No BIG PHARMA spreading death for big profits, 2 No Democrat Governors and Health Officials, and 3 No MSM.  Africa will also have few deaths due to face mask rebreathing.
1303700006629593088 2020-09-09 22:21:17 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Jerusalem_Post @realDonaldTrump 👏👏👏👏👏
1303699790136446976 2020-09-09 22:20:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @robdetf @SharylAttkisson Indeed, it was the command staff that was reported to have quit.  The leadership.  The experienced people.  But we don't know how many others and how many will leave over the next few months.  I would not like to be a resident of Rochester at this time.
1303697425350057984 2020-09-09 22:11:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RonMilnerBoodle @tazmac55 Sad.  Little soul not able to live her God given life.  Makes you cry.
1303696962831613952 2020-09-09 22:09:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BryonnyM @DanScavino Love it.
1303696210713223175 2020-09-09 22:06:12 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ByronYork @Hadigee1 @nypost Dementia is a hallmark of leading Democrats.  So the parallel question becomes, who is running the Biden campaign and who will be the real president if he wins?
1303694879071977474 2020-09-09 22:00:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @jaljr @alpipkin I can't wait for Biden's nomination for his work in showing that a basement is a viable habitat.
1303694649945595906 2020-09-09 22:00:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SharylAttkisson @robdetf There are police left in Rochester?  Who knew?
1303694183106920449 2020-09-09 21:58:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Jamierodr14 @tonydasit1 @realDonaldTrump I thought his growing support among blacks threatened Biden's path.  What next, suburban housewives that don't want to have BLM / Anitfa invade their neighborhoods?  Pretty soon all Biden will have left is the fake ballot voter fraud.
1303693352357961730 2020-09-09 21:54:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @asheborn57 LOL, bad enough that these are the people teaching children in the Portland public schools, but would you want them controlling your life?  Disclaimer - Not all of those pictured may be members of the teachers union, but they are representative of many of the rioters who are.

Will his wife / sister be on stage with him to help him out.  C'mom man!  You know Brazille already has a set of the @FoxNews questions.
1303675655960231936 2020-09-09 20:44:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @redwins3_first @scott_helmick No problem.  Most of the NYS ballots have already been completed in China and are on the way to NYS.

If you ever wonder why it graduates indoctrinated illerates, look no further.

You need to look in a mirror if you see that stuff where it is not because you are projecting your own bias and views.  I am not a Republican, I am a Trump supporter and there is a big difference.

Take an old show, put in an all black cast, and spout woke stuff whatever that is.  How about something new and interesting that truely represents different ethnic groups?  Something with an edge that is funny.
1303457141999558656 2020-09-09 06:16:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tevan2864 So Trump is at an all time high approval, he has been embraced by blacks, and Hispanics who have fled from Communist dictatorships fully get what Biden and his Marxist gang will do but Biden is slighlty ahead by the MSM polls.  I don't get it.  Who is his base?  BLM / Antifa?

1303124014370447362 2020-09-08 08:12:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrAndyNgo Actually, in the Marxist university system that we now have in place, going to college and getting an education are usually exclusive activities.  College is a con where young people go into a life time of debt to spend 4+ years and end up knowing less than when they started.

1303062904460029952 2020-09-08 04:09:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LeahR77 @bfraser747 Perhaps the Democrats should give up on much of the country and move significant resources into CA &amp; NY.    If they loss in either of those states or both, it is game over for the party way into the distant future.

1302418695113732097 2020-09-06 09:29:49 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joshdcaplan LOL, the Marxist Democrats are surely a scummy bunch.  All this does is add another point in the, yep they are going to cheat column.  People in Oregon know what they are voting for; crime and chaos or law and a good life.  It is their choice and the "Officials" can phuck off.
1302417755002474496 2020-09-06 09:26:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @mondaywithgirls @CovfefeKatie LOL, double meaning, electricity and booze.  Nancy will never be without either of them.  But you are right, she has ice cream which will never melt because of a power blackout that screws most of the other people in CA.
1302386204696952832 2020-09-06 07:20:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CovfefeKatie @realDonaldTrump I bet you Nancy has juice.
1302372667392024576 2020-09-06 06:26:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DeePSw31 @miles_commodore He was being sarcastic and giving the Democrats misleading information.  Check out his time line.
1302371213717639168 2020-09-06 06:21:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @camayusa1 @marlahohner Wow, a largely peaceful fire.
1302369995289100288 2020-09-06 06:16:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Freedom4Red4 And it all ties back to @MittRomney .
1302346887605841920 2020-09-06 04:44:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KellyO @NBCNews So phucking what?  At least he gets out of the basement for a little sun and fresh air.
1302341498017472512 2020-09-06 04:23:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Feisty_FL @jimbrown1964 Name one winner in the Democrat party and I will answer your question.  As a matter of fact, name one person in the Democrat party that you would let babysit your kids.
1302340702857121793 2020-09-06 04:19:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto @WayneDupreeShow You mean Obama's good friend?
1302299587487526913 2020-09-06 01:36:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DebHaslam @alpipkin Rochester is a city with a Democrat mayor in a state with a Democrat governor.  Of course people are going to be attacked with impunity by BLM thugs.
1302298523551948800 2020-09-06 01:32:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RacySicilian I wonder what letters she will be sending out if she is elected.  She is one sick, sick woman.  I mean Hillary level sick.
1302297935682494465 2020-09-06 01:29:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto Wow, the Chinese money must be drying up so now Northeastern has to defraud students.
1302291477469429760 2020-09-06 01:04:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MicrosoftEdge Microsoft Edge sucks  Like many Microsoft products, it was pushed on the consumer who was not given a choice.
1302252769818980352 2020-09-05 22:30:29 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Adorable_Todd I am going to check, so many thugs so many riots, but doesn't Rochester have a Democrat Mayor?
1302251955939471360 2020-09-05 22:27:15 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AwakeNotW0ke @TPBrok @EricMMatheny LOL
1302220479655104518 2020-09-05 20:22:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LeahR77 Much truth.
1302219253580361731 2020-09-05 20:17:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EricMMatheny Shotguns work gud
1302218280292155392 2020-09-05 20:13:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @reubing Plus the jobs loss among restaurant staff in NYC is Trump's fault.  Ask @chuckschumer .
1302217144935919621 2020-09-05 20:08:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @charliekirk11 Yeah, but how many Biden votes have already been printed in China?
1302216695444942849 2020-09-05 20:07:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EricMMatheny Is it legal to blow someone off of your roof?
1302214944532828160 2020-09-05 20:00:11 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrAndyNgo If they are being arrested on Federal charges, they may not be back in schools teaching next week.

1302211914538217473 2020-09-05 19:48:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @_NCPatriot_ Someone should tell the Jewish Democrat, NEVER AGAIN!
1302208731992616960 2020-09-05 19:35:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @marklevinshow Would you put Biden with a woman who is already an assault victim?
1302207640039088129 2020-09-05 19:31:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @dragohylndr @LyndaG1963 Where is the police?
1302206750246887424 2020-09-05 19:27:37 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews @FoxNews Like the dossier, isn't it?  Complete Democrat lies &amp; fabrication that the MSM has embraced and is running with  Big lies matter.
1302059930866778112 2020-09-05 09:44:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joshdcaplan @lesmagrittes Think that they will fine her if she doesn't seclude herself?
1302059216564183040 2020-09-05 09:41:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MayorOfLA I know this isn't what you want to hear, but go phuck yourself and the Marxist controlling mule you rode in on.
1302058878268366854 2020-09-05 09:40:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RashidaTlaib Something to do with blinding police with lasers, resisting arrest, throwing rocks at police, throwing bottles of urine, feces, fire bombs, fireworks, hitting police with sticks, and shooting people in the streets.  Other than 20 more reasons, I can't come up with anything.
1302057597923549184 2020-09-05 09:34:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Ciao4Niaow The Democrats know their base, the useful idiots.  The thing I find hard to get is that the Party elites laugh in public about the stupidity of their followers and the followers are so stupid, it does not bother them one bit.  https://t.co/qLdUzEAD0l
1301981654945116160 2020-09-05 04:33:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @scotty_kiker Oh my word, is that real?

1301980078574723072 2020-09-05 04:26:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SpeakerPelosi Hey, how is the Kennedy center doing with all the pork you sent them last time around?

1301977797619937280 2020-09-05 04:17:51 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KelemenCari 52% is totally unbeatable in an HONEST election.
1301969890773889025 2020-09-05 03:46:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MeghanMcCain I remember your dad in one of his most despicable moments when everything he promised the voters of Arizona was shown to be a lie.  https://t.co/p0cZgYC0DZ
1301968881259429890 2020-09-05 03:42:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joepalojoe @gatewaypundit This is a real dilemma for the Biden handlers.  If they don't put stage direction in the prewritten copy, Joe won't know what to do.  If they do put it in, he will read it as part of his speech showing that he has no comprehension of what he is saying  Oh what to do.  What to do.
1301967678437957632 2020-09-05 03:37:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ChuckCallesto I am not now nor have I ever been on @Facebook.  Sorry for bragging.  In any case, if this is true and Facebook made those assertions and has take those actions, they will be sued out the wazoo, back in, and out again.

He likely has to get help tying his shoes in the morning after he is told what shoes are.  But never forget his / Democrat voters.  https://t.co/5Xe5H5PDWa
1301914167029366784 2020-09-05 00:05:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ConservVoice @gatewaypundit Democrats enable death.  It is what they do.
1301914023462490113 2020-09-05 00:04:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @domenicadelia22 @lavist1 I believe that is so much leftist BS.  The Democrats live on a diet of fear and threats as well as misinformation and lies.  If an uprising occurred, it would be put down and the Marxist / Democrat Bullshit ended with prejudice.  It would end quickly and be ended for a long time.
1301871903183761410 2020-09-04 21:17:03 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KurtSchlichter LOL, sarcasm becomes you.
1301871712435281920 2020-09-04 21:16:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @hucklebee_sarah @DemsH8Americans Kind of reminds me of @AdamSchiff and the Russian hoax.  The Democrats are not to smart, they win by being wily criminals.
1301871305231273985 2020-09-04 21:14:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec Hey @Forbes , guy was a riotous thug and murderer, not a anti-racist protester.
1301870823712595974 2020-09-04 21:12:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @CorporalBen @gatewaypundit So now what?  BLM gets a fee every time you turn on a light?
1301853306914893824 2020-09-04 20:03:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @reubing @OANN I disagree with you there.  But in any case, the reason I tune in to the news is to get the news, not manipulated and often suppressed coverage in an entertainment package.  Besides, there are very few MSM people that I like.
1301847230588923904 2020-09-04 19:39:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @my3monkees Just some smelly lint that landed on a page of history that will be blown away and quickly forgotten.

1301845359518343170 2020-09-04 19:31:35 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BullPup2A Why are they shouting, "no peace, no justice".  It seems to define BLM / Antifa but it seems strange that they would adopt that mindless chant.
1301843812038266882 2020-09-04 19:25:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RepAdamSchiff Hahahahaha  Russia  Hahahahaha  That dog stopped hunting a few years ago.
1301842937655906306 2020-09-04 19:21:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SpeakerPelosi Thank you for taking time out from your attack on a single mother of two who is desperately trying to survive to bring us this message.

1301675461534130176 2020-09-04 08:16:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kramerreport @realDonaldTrump That is why I sub to @OANN and hardly watch @FoxNews any more.

1301559672386723840 2020-09-04 00:36:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SenSchumer Any idea how Trump can hurt NYC any more than is already happening?  You Democrats are doing a great job if it as it stands..  Luck for you Democrats are so stupid.  https://t.co/4LFvcu9wn2
1301542000152334336 2020-09-03 23:26:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @IngrahamAngle The Swamp is fighting for continuation of their privilege and right to obtain wealth through protected criminal activity.  They are also fighting to protect themselves from paying for past crime.
1301541437067022338 2020-09-03 23:23:54 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Pismo_B Male, female, black, white, gay, straight, or any other classification makes no difference.  All Democrat mayors are the same.  Why does anyone vote for those arrogant assholes.  Imagine his town if Antifa / BLM paid a visit.   His dinks in Minneapolis observation was Dem classic
1301539950765068297 2020-09-03 23:18:00 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Wil_Johnson1 @gatewaypundit Does Soros pay the $ 15 / hr. while you are in prison.  Just asking for those considering a career in rioting and looting.
1301539672326197248 2020-09-03 23:16:53 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @gatewaypundit I thought Blake Sr. hated crackers and Biden is as cracker as can be.  At least he is not Jewish.

Many of the employed people have shared in the YUGE stock market gains  A healthy economy means jobs and tax revenue to help the unemployed.  If you got a job and stopped rioting for the Soros $ 15 / hr. maybe you'd benefit

1301536206384054272 2020-09-03 23:03:07 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tedwheeler Any idea how much the Antifa / BLM riots you are supporting &amp; enabling is costing Portland in lost revenue, damage properties, &amp; first responder overtime?  How much is Portland directly paying the thugs (teachers not teaching, gov't assistance, &amp; others)?  C'mon man. @tedwheeler

1301494187703980032 2020-09-03 20:16:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PolitixGal @BreitbartNews @SpeakerPelosi is scum.  Not only did she break the law, but then attacked a single mom of two, that her nephew is putting out of business, to escape the charge of hypocrite.  Democrats are elitest garbage who make laws for the others to obey.
1301492949339926528 2020-09-03 20:11:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bubblebathgirl @joehos18 Where are Democrat mayors relocating to?  Think about @tedwheeler for example.  Where in Portland will he be more secure?  Is there a no riot and burn down buildings zone that we don't know about?
1301490429091692544 2020-09-03 20:01:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @liquidlaugh After the movie, you can have dinner outdoors while roaming Antifas assault you.
1301489929671720960 2020-09-03 19:59:14 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @may_talcott @DonaldJTrumpJr I voted no.  Does the city that twice elected De Blasio want to be a decent place to live?  Is the time of NYC past?  To the good people still there, I say get out while you still can.  Besides the Trump family has made enough sacrifice cleaning up the Federal shit hole.
1301486855410446336 2020-09-03 19:47:01 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Politics_Polls This poll will flip once the mail in ballots are received.

1301481329855361024 2020-09-03 19:25:04 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tedwheeler And you are fleeing your luxury condo, why?  Since Antifa / BLM run Portland should not they be funding the city?
1301335733798490112 2020-09-03 09:46:31 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @NYGovCuomo Many New York residents read your comment on their cell phones while standing in line at the U-Haul office near them.
1301334260834426881 2020-09-03 09:40:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KarluskaP @BirdingTrip Actually, Trump does have an army.  It you are telling the president of the United States that he  cannot come to NYC under threat, then what army will protect you from law enforcement?

1301256008702988290 2020-09-03 04:29:43 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Rigged_It @realDonaldTrump I wonder what it is like to blow in his ear.  https://t.co/UwaJhr0YiK
1301255822526222336 2020-09-03 04:28:58 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump Do you know if @tedwheeler is going to move to a Republican controlled area away from Portland where he will be safe?
1301255525439475712 2020-09-03 04:27:48 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ConservVoice @gatewaypundit So now the narrative is that it was illegal to show Pelosi committing a selfish and illegal act.  Love the Democrats, they always can come up with some Bull Shit.  The party is so fortunate that their obedient sheeple are so stupid.
1301252237646200832 2020-09-03 04:14:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @realDonaldTrump Looks like Wall Street does not think Democrat Election Fraud will be enough to steal election.
1301251798691278851 2020-09-03 04:12:59 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DailyCaller Any idea where he is moving to?  Will he be moving out of Portland because it is not safe to live there?
1301250968080662529 2020-09-03 04:09:41 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Bryan700 Even worse, after his arrest he was let back out onto the streets.
1301246273421365248 2020-09-03 03:51:02 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @joshdcaplan Does anyone else suspect that they wear masks not to conceal their identity, but rather because they are so ugly?
1301203526740307969 2020-09-03 01:01:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @elenochle LOL, probably had a nice secure conversation in the plane.
1301192005251338240 2020-09-03 00:15:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @EliClemmer @willowmycat Didn't mayor Zombie of Chicago do the same thing?
1301179864318390272 2020-09-02 23:27:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @atensnut In CA Pelosi is fine with breaking the law.  Ask her nephew.
1301179612974645252 2020-09-02 23:26:09 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @BoarGator @papacass84 Might be the best you can do with the quality of college degrees an competition from foreign workers.  I'd ask about fringes like funeral expenses, medical expenses, bail, and expense reimbursement for ammunition and accelerants.
1301117876842016768 2020-09-02 19:20:50 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @LucyTrumplican @SpinePainBegone So having destroyed Portland @tedwheeler is moving.
1301115092054859776 2020-09-02 19:09:46 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @liquidlaugh He has been reading on how to be a mayor in the writings of @tedwheeler .
1301114053935247362 2020-09-02 19:05:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @WingsofCrystal @nypmetro Sad thing is that over half think things are peachy keen.
1300973897068675073 2020-09-02 09:48:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ReaIdonaadtrump Prayers go with your son.
1300973558466633730 2020-09-02 09:47:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @SBarr05299608 I think @Twitter is phucking with the wrong guy.
1300972988343279616 2020-09-02 09:45:05 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @robreiner Hahahahahahaha  What a maroon.  https://t.co/x5EeSvKSvw
1300900338526908416 2020-09-02 04:56:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @hrkbenowen Kenosha offers small town charm and is in the midst of opportunity.  No kidding --&gt;  https://t.co/NRsbu4Za2r  Are the Democrats totally full of shit or what?
1300896192369364994 2020-09-02 04:39:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @ArmyRangerRick @denlusk13 Don't, they will kill you.  Portland is a Democrat enforced crime zone.
1300893881437831168 2020-09-02 04:30:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Scoop_Johnson @SJSpotlight Methinks the Democrat have let loose the Kraken and have no idea how to control it.
1300893600532684800 2020-09-02 04:29:38 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @tedcruz All elected mayors of San Jose have been members of the Democratic Party.  There has been a Dem mayor since at least 1967.  The Democrats have built the city into a stimulating paradise where neighbors are all to willing to help decorate the neighborhood homes.
1300890907139399680 2020-09-02 04:18:56 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DougIbendahl This visual is why the Democrat Mayor and Democrat Governor did not want Trump in Kenosha.  This is what the Democrats bring.
1300877703709487104 2020-09-02 03:26:28 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RN_JB7 @freedmeto Stay safe.
1300877572935356416 2020-09-02 03:25:57 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Chicago1Ray @CandysOpinions @realDonaldTrump @kimKBaltimore Dear Baltimore  You have a chance to start toward a good life.  Will you take it?
1300876994536599553 2020-09-02 03:23:39 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MrAndyNgo Who knew that there were businesses left in downtown Portland?
1300876775531012096 2020-09-02 03:22:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @johncitysq Is it me, or do many Democrats look like the walking dead?
1300876361632866304 2020-09-02 03:21:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TimRunsHisMouth C'mon man.  What about DeBlasio? What about the Chicago Zombie? What about Bowser of DC? The Democrat mayor of Kenosha is not that great. Minneapolis, Baltimore, LA, SF, ........................  Every Democrat mayor is the worst mayor in America.
1300874951260401664 2020-09-02 03:15:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @JackPosobiec C'mon man.  Get real.  Paul Ryan represented BIG PHARMA and the Democrat Party.  He probably had to look Kenosha up on the map when he heard about the shooting.  He is now working his magic at @FoxNews.
1300874409675091969 2020-09-02 03:13:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @HillaryClinton Just like the conspiracy theory that you funded an ex British Agent to collect false information from Russian sources, put them in a dossier, and use the materials to defraud the FISA court.  Who do you believe, Hillary or your lying eyes?
1300873757825753089 2020-09-02 03:10:47 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @vicksiern @SenSchumer What do you think?  https://t.co/TBfEjOZLeS
1300847746010628096 2020-09-02 01:27:25 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Breaking911 Very diverse group.  It's a small world after all.
1300839126330044421 2020-09-02 00:53:10 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @100PercFEDUP In NYC, 20 arrests wins you a special Mayor's award.  The purp is well on his way.
1300838560761704448 2020-09-02 00:50:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Michael31093553 I am Joe Biden and my handlers told me to appove this message.
1300838175909326848 2020-09-02 00:49:24 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Crossbearer1956 I believe that after processing he was let back out on the street and given a subway token by the mayor's office.
1300837922522898437 2020-09-02 00:48:23 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @may_talcott I can't, I have a HOA.   Never ever buy a home with an HOA if you have any way of avoiding doing so.
1300810724378210305 2020-09-01 23:00:19 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kentpg She is working as hard as she can to make that happen.
1300800921656422401 2020-09-01 22:21:22 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @PpollingNumbers @JackPosobiec Bull thit
1300799253766270976 2020-09-01 22:14:44 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @DrNealHouston @blupony3 @newsmax Hopefully, he will not be wasting any time talking to the Democrat mayor.
1300799103010443265 2020-09-01 22:14:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @AriFleischer @BlissTabitha Whenever I see flags behind Biden at an event, I wonder if after the speech his Bernie Bros handlers will box them up and ship them to Portland to be burned.
1300797863975219200 2020-09-01 22:09:13 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TomFitton @USAHipster @realDonaldTrump Why do you want Trump to send in troops to keep @tedwheeler from being killed by the thugs he has nurtured all these months?
1300797182430162944 2020-09-01 22:06:30 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @donnantwich @missnormagene Democrat thugs.
1300796893262303233 2020-09-01 22:05:21 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @kylie_oneil75 Funny, who would have thought rioting thugs would have more frequent flyer miles than the average business person.
1300796375156703233 2020-09-01 22:03:18 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @Acosta And you are saying that Biden can get his shoes on the correct feet in the morning without his handlers helping?  Everyone knows that Biden is mentally gone to somewhere else &amp; "peolple" are calling the shots.  So your lies just  make people shake their heads; more MSM bull
1300782397844107267 2020-09-01 21:07:45 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @KimmGlass If Baltimore does not take this first step / chance to dig out of the misery and poverty rancid Democrat politicians have brought it then the people there who vote Democrat deserve what they will get.  To the rest, get out.
1300761453289373698 2020-09-01 19:44:32 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 Baltimore will never learn, will it ?
1300759475473641473 2020-09-01 19:36:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 Flip that seat .  One Democrat in office is one to many and a threat to America.
1300758470057013253 2020-09-01 19:32:40 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @wvufanagent991a @kimfreethinker Or leave.
1300757907022118912 2020-09-01 19:30:26 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @RicciGeri @BarryRChapman Why has the perp with the gun not been charged?
1300754002385055744 2020-09-01 19:14:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @TX_WalkerRanger Me.
1300752994065985539 2020-09-01 19:10:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @matt_hudgens @UghToHillary Good stuff.  Bet no sustained riots there.
1300752295261474817 2020-09-01 19:08:08 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @MulliganTrails @PatriotM1A777 @JoeBiden There are moderate Democrats?  Who knew?
1300749919439921158 2020-09-01 18:58:42 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @FloridaDude297 Close.  Turn that sucker around.  No Democrats anywhere at any time.
1300609045418524672 2020-09-01 09:38:55 +0800 <HaleyTessIsis> @hrkbenowen Actually I wish they would.  That way we would not have to hear from them for a year.
