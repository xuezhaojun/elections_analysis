An effective negative ad blitz could still, in theory, leave a mark.

HRC had built up 20 yrs of negatives that could not be ignored or erased; Biden many flaws are being very successfully buried by the press, &amp; ignored by the public 4. For all his flaws, 2016 Trump could lay low(ish) in October, avoiding self-damage; today . . .
1313833588471857154 2020-10-07 21:28:31 +0800 <nealgetz> @yhazony 1. Trump was new to politics, &amp; undecideds could give the (electoral) unknown a chance 2. 2016 national polls ended up pretty correct, @ 2-3% HRC lead, but Trump drew an inside straight to barely win WI-MI-PA; polls much worse for him now (1/2)
