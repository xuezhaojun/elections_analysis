1341532564306182144 2020-12-23 07:54:22 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @Lancophone The uncanny valley here is quite bad - lip sync is slightly off and dead behind the eyes 😖, prime example of how very subtle inaccuracies can seriously detract from the overall impression
1339628220837183490 2020-12-18 01:47:11 +0800 <IzzyFitton> What an enjoyable way to end the working day!  It was great to listen to other people’s perspectives on #VR training and delighted to have added some new people to my network as well 👍🏼
1338063754798501888 2020-12-13 18:10:33 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @MichaelProulx The bird had a good aim I’ll give it that 😬😂
1337457119663169545 2020-12-12 02:00:00 +0800 <IzzyFitton> Anyone else got that Friday feeling? 👏  Time to kick-back and enjoy the weekend! 😁  #FridayFeeling #WorkLifeBalance  https://t.co/1H03TTxN2B
1337373776019939329 2020-12-11 20:28:50 +0800 <IzzyFitton> Can confirm I’d much rather win the lottery 😐😂...  https://t.co/RGuOdxylmV
1336232647786459137 2020-12-08 16:54:23 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @Lancophone @centre_digi_ent It was nice to catch up with everyone in gather town 😊
1336020777242677248 2020-12-08 02:52:30 +0800 <IzzyFitton> My little avatar and I attended @centre_digi_ent ‘s virtual poster showcase this evening!  Not quite the same as getting together face-to-face but an enjoyable opportunity to talk ‘research’ nonetheless!   #phdlife #virtualevent  https://t.co/QNpBmqvkzS
1333547183853932546 2020-12-01 07:03:19 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @LukeWorganTech Fab. Can’t wait! 😂
1333546538602295296 2020-12-01 07:00:45 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @LukeWorganTech 😂😂 glad it’s not just me
1333538544665686016 2020-12-01 06:28:59 +0800 <IzzyFitton> Also I apologise to anyone who had to read my assignments which I failed to proof read...I now know how irritating it is and I’m sorry 🙃
1333537993286688768 2020-12-01 06:26:48 +0800 <IzzyFitton> I never knew how high my standards are until I started marking - I’ve made a mental note to put my ‘be kind’ cap on before I start 😬😂
1332854657132097541 2020-11-29 09:11:28 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @LukeWorganTech My cat is obsessed with cheese and onion crisps 😂
1332001131363512320 2020-11-27 00:39:51 +0800 <IzzyFitton> “Hermes have delivered your parcel” clicks photos to see my parcel in someone else’s porch 😢 - thanks @Hermesparcels 🙃😂
1332000855135019009 2020-11-27 00:38:45 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @CreativeCardiff @tjw_94 Subscribed ✅
1331900094614999042 2020-11-26 17:58:22 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @tjw_94 Oh thanks Thomas I hadn’t heard about this, I’ll see if I can find anything about what went on! 😊
1330555233915842560 2020-11-23 00:54:22 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @JennieWren3x @DVLAgovuk 😱😱 that makes absolutely no sense does it?!  Hopefully if there’s a cancellation he can get it done sooner! 🤞🏼
1328410629821112320 2020-11-17 02:52:29 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @centre_digi_ent Thank you 😊
1328284904203882497 2020-11-16 18:32:54 +0800 <IzzyFitton> Academic Milestone: My very first publicaiton is now live ✅ 🎉 #AcademicChatter   You can check out our paper on Immersive virtual environments and embodied agents for e-learning applications at  https://t.co/AiqT8LqONK  #HCI #immersivetechnology  #vreducation

1327182439110889474 2020-11-13 17:32:05 +0800 <IzzyFitton> Looking forward to attending a “well balanced working” doctoral training workshop this morning - finding a balance is so important and possibly more difficult than ever now we are expected to live, work, relax etc. in one place! #selfcare
1319595609700159489 2020-10-23 19:04:44 +0800 <IzzyFitton> Thank you @ithinkwellHugh for your ‘7 Secrets of Successful Doctoral Students’. It was a really great, interactive zoom workshop - filled with useful resources and honest humour about the life of a PhD student, and a great opportunity to talk to others in the same boat! 🤓🗣
1318863330027732993 2020-10-21 18:34:55 +0800 <IzzyFitton> Me too! It’s an honour to be part of the @centre_digi_ent family 😄🤓
1318509517596987398 2020-10-20 19:09:00 +0800 <IzzyFitton> So pleased! The work I did for my undergraduate dissertation has now been accepted for publication in the Open Access journal @PeerJCompSci   I’d like to take this opportunity to thank co-authors @Lancophone &amp; @MichaelProulx  for their help in shaping this work into a paper! 🌟
1317789367881039874 2020-10-18 19:27:23 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @HelloFreshUK is it standard procedure to crumple up the recipe cards before putting them in the box? This is the second week in a row I’ve had at least one recipe card like this 🙃 Anyone else finding this is happening in transit?  https://t.co/vvXhAOlo1x
1313864300361121794 2020-10-07 23:30:34 +0800 <IzzyFitton> Taking a break from writing my dissertation on training skills in VR to watch Emanuel Tomozei, PWC talk about Soft Skills training in Virtual Reality   #BVRL @BristolVRLab @AltspaceVR
1313464466814709762 2020-10-06 21:01:46 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @EONhelp I have tried, DM'ed this morning. Cheers, Izzy
1312826160976461825 2020-10-05 02:45:22 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @Ginsoakedgirlie @craftginclub Yodel are terrible, my gin box was delivered 2 days before they said it would be and was just left in plain sight, and my mum’s was also left on her doorstep!
1311656571781476352 2020-10-01 21:17:50 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @EONhelp I keep getting asked to activate my online account, I input the information contained in the email and it just keeps coming back with “sorry, your account isn’t available while we fix it” ??
1311220276491939840 2020-09-30 16:24:09 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @centre_digi_ent @ARTAIBath @j2bryson Was this talk recorded?? I couldn’t attend but would love to give it a watch if it was recorded 👍🏼
1309810045387931648 2020-09-26 19:00:24 +0800 <IzzyFitton> Had a headache since the moment I opened my eyes this morning - feel like going back to bed and starting again tomorrow 🤕🙃
1308303706660597760 2020-09-22 15:14:45 +0800 <IzzyFitton> I started wearing my Fitbit again recently and I keep feeling phantom buzzes on my wrist 😂, my brain is playing tricks on me! 🧠
1307662094024822794 2020-09-20 20:45:13 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @LukeWorganTech I think it’s interesting territory and while I wear one whilst I’m shopping, I don’t particularly take offence by anyone not wearing one. I get more irked when people wear them but it’s not covering their nose - there’s just no point 🤦🏻‍♀️😂
1307574099053621257 2020-09-20 14:55:33 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @LukeWorganTech The strict rules for donning and doffing ppe are what make it effective, which the majority of the public don’t follow - hardly surprising considering we’re untrained and have just been asked to wear any face covering, I’m not convinced they do a lot for preventing the spread 🤷🏻‍♀️
1307573267155255297 2020-09-20 14:52:15 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @LukeWorganTech I wear a face mask but I think their purpose is to put people at ease, not necessarily prevent the spread. They make people feel more comfortable in shops etc.
1306629425639895044 2020-09-18 00:21:45 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @JennieWren3x @craftginclub How bizarre! It’s a craft gin club competition to win a year’s supply of gin! 🤪
1306627571459805184 2020-09-18 00:14:23 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @craftginclub @JennieWren3x you’ll be in need of a gin after 9 months t-total 👶🏻🍸 x
1306292584176906240 2020-09-17 02:03:16 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @GutsyBiotech @OpenAcademics Calibri for casual notes, Times New Roman for ‘proper’ writing 😂
1306155250437558273 2020-09-16 16:57:33 +0800 <IzzyFitton> Speaking to a friend this morning, I thought they were pulling my leg when they said “the river is empty” - I was like “what are you talking about?!”   Apparently this 👇🏼👇🏼  https://t.co/nW3W7byRz6
1302871618050560002 2020-09-07 15:29:34 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @AleAliSousa I have noticed more 4, 5, 6 bed furnished student houses available than there would be ordinarily at this time of year due to the decline in undergrad students relocating to Bath this year. Unfortunately, for PhD and young professionals it is always slim pickings!
1302511799284256769 2020-09-06 15:39:47 +0800 <IzzyFitton> @AleAliSousa I imagine you get similar problems elsewhere - but it is ridiculous in Bath - perhaps with it being such a small city! The majority of rentals are only on the market for about 3 days!
1302364563141206021 2020-09-06 05:54:43 +0800 <IzzyFitton> Not sure what annoys me more...  The fact it was falsely advertised by the estate agents using old photographs, the fact landlords can get away with making no repairs, or the fact it will most definitely get snapped up because Bath is so strapped for housing!
1302363473679089664 2020-09-06 05:50:23 +0800 <IzzyFitton> I saw a flat in Bath today - it was £1100 per month to rent and this was just one of the photos I took because I was so shocked at the state!  (Yes that is a hole in the ceiling surrounded by what is clearly evidence of a catastrophic leak!)  https://t.co/WNp2HnRBFp
