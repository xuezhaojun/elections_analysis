1321458301633253379 2020-10-28 22:26:25 +0800 <leemichelle009> Disgusting!

1321453189489713152 2020-10-28 22:06:06 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JackPosobiec This will be nothing just like all the other major news conferences.
1321453008597753863 2020-10-28 22:05:23 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JoeBiden stays silent on everything. He hides in basement, gives no interviews and takes no questions form the press.
1321452748278255617 2020-10-28 22:04:21 +0800 <leemichelle009> @RichardGrenell Where is the doj, fbi, cia, congress. America is unrecognizable right now.
1321451264455155713 2020-10-28 21:58:27 +0800 <leemichelle009> @jonathanvswan are you covering the Biden China scandal?
1321450926092242947 2020-10-28 21:57:06 +0800 <leemichelle009> Vote for @realDonaldTrump for law and order.
1321450207960272898 2020-10-28 21:54:15 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JaniceDean @NYGovCuomo This is despicable.
1321450028754456576 2020-10-28 21:53:32 +0800 <leemichelle009> @EamonJavers How about the Biden whistleblower. Are you covering him?
1321449875599511559 2020-10-28 21:52:56 +0800 <leemichelle009> Keep it up!  Get out and vote for @realDonaldTrump Show up in massive numbers and don‚Äôt let them steal the election.
1321439445757952002 2020-10-28 21:11:29 +0800 <leemichelle009> @jaketapper @ChrisMegerian How about Biden taking millions from China Jake?  Does that interest you??
1321438059154546689 2020-10-28 21:05:59 +0800 <leemichelle009> @DonaldJTrumpJr It is insulting to Americans. The fbi, doj, congress, cia, someone needs to step up and explain things to Americans. Suppressing information before and election is criminal.
1321436284737490947 2020-10-28 20:58:56 +0800 <leemichelle009> @BillHemmer we expect more from you.
1321436038208905220 2020-10-28 20:57:57 +0800 <leemichelle009> @RepLeeZeldin The fbi, doj and congress need to step up. This is a national security issue with a Presidential candidate.
1321433394287357958 2020-10-28 20:47:26 +0800 <leemichelle009> @SeanDuffyWI Get the real word out Sean.
1321433138988519424 2020-10-28 20:46:26 +0800 <leemichelle009> @DonaldJTrumpJr The media is disgusting but where is the FBI, DOJ and congress?  This is a national security issue.
1321426834077220865 2020-10-28 20:21:22 +0800 <leemichelle009> @RichardGrenell @maggieNYT @samstein They are the worst!
1321420471120863238 2020-10-28 19:56:05 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JoeConchaTV Please!  They cover Biden and Obama in full and cut in and out of Trump speeches and rallies. Most anchors at Fox are anti @realDonaldTrump and their leadership definitely is.
1321417230307991553 2020-10-28 19:43:13 +0800 <leemichelle009> Why are democrats voting for this?
1321413019151278082 2020-10-28 19:26:29 +0800 <leemichelle009> This is what Joe Biden is going to do. Go out today and vote for @realDonaldTrump
1321395309201731584 2020-10-28 18:16:06 +0800 <leemichelle009> @SavingAmerica4U @FoxNews Paul Ryan??
1321393805409558528 2020-10-28 18:10:08 +0800 <leemichelle009> If this is a distraction to take focus off of Tony B. Story then our justice system is done. The Biden corruption should be the biggest story out there and the FBI and DOJ should be focusing on that period.
1321287543908958209 2020-10-28 11:07:53 +0800 <leemichelle009> @RepDougCollins @JoeBiden But it is still okay for a compromised candidate to run for President of the United States? This is disgraceful. Where is the FBI, DOJ, Congress?  American voters deserve answers on this before the election.
1321263310193545220 2020-10-28 09:31:35 +0800 <leemichelle009> @ksenijapavlovic Will anyone in the msm cover it or will they continue to protect Biden? Definitely a national security issue.
1321262653407449089 2020-10-28 09:28:59 +0800 <leemichelle009> @DineshDSouza @peteslew Will anyone in the msm cover it?  Where is the FBI and Congress?  Seems as though it would be a national security issue to find out if a Presidential candidate is compromised.
1321251249539395584 2020-10-28 08:43:40 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JasonMillerinDC Play clips of it at the rallies

1320733168262107137 2020-10-26 22:25:00 +0800 <leemichelle009> Why is this okay with people? Come out come out wherever you are Joe.
1320732923486785537 2020-10-26 22:24:01 +0800 <leemichelle009> @DonaldJTrumpJr Does anyone believe anything at this point? Wake up America. We have a great leader in @realDonaldTrump and they are doing everything they can to take him down. They want to control you. Vote Trump and do not let that happen.
1320730895922462722 2020-10-26 22:15:58 +0800 <leemichelle009> Who would vote for this shell of a man?
1320728554221555714 2020-10-26 22:06:39 +0800 <leemichelle009> Americans deserve better period.
1320715084805640193 2020-10-26 21:13:08 +0800 <leemichelle009> Why does he keep misspeaking?  Is he going to misspeak to world leaders about the intentions of the US. Wake up people. Who wants someone like this as their leader?
1320712019310501889 2020-10-26 21:00:57 +0800 <leemichelle009> @FoxNews Biden is avoiding reporters. It is pathetic. If he cannot face the people then how would he ever be able to lead the US. He is not capable.
1320711049163776002 2020-10-26 20:57:06 +0800 <leemichelle009> @EamonJavers No he‚Äôs suggesting that all you guys do is report on that when there are other important stories like Biden corruption that no ‚Äújournalists‚Äù will report on. If you are so interested in covid report on the fact that all the steps joe thinks we should take is what Trump has done.
1320707303314771968 2020-10-26 20:42:13 +0800 <leemichelle009> @johncardillo They can‚Äôt have him screaming and losing it at another empty rally made up of only @realDonaldTrump supporters.
1320707023655362561 2020-10-26 20:41:06 +0800 <leemichelle009> Why does his wife always have to help him?  He needs more help from everyone than any candidate I have ever seen. Who would vote for him?  Even if you don‚Äôt like Trump is this who you want representing the USA?  This is pathetic.
1320704470406352896 2020-10-26 20:30:57 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JasonMillerinDC What is wrong with him? How do people accept this as normal behavior for a candidate for President of the United States?  We want a leader not someone who hides all the time.
1320680878582964224 2020-10-26 18:57:13 +0800 <leemichelle009> All this while Joe is hiding in the basement refusing to take questions or do interviews. Wake up America.
1320679802710466560 2020-10-26 18:52:56 +0800 <leemichelle009> @CassandraRules Can‚Äôt even get excited anymore because all the bombshells turn out to be duds.
1320675854272385024 2020-10-26 18:37:15 +0800 <leemichelle009> @CassandraRules It is despicable.
1320530891215720448 2020-10-26 09:01:13 +0800 <leemichelle009> What a partisan hack @LesleyRStahl is. Unbelievable.
1320526509489197057 2020-10-26 08:43:48 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JasonMillerinDC This is why they don‚Äôt do press conferences or give interviews. They have to stay hidden.
1320523171989278720 2020-10-26 08:30:32 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JasonMillerinDC @NorahODonnell Post the clip.
1320523019446558720 2020-10-26 08:29:56 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JoeConchaTV Is there a clip?
1320522921509617664 2020-10-26 08:29:33 +0800 <leemichelle009> @LisaMarieBoothe Amen to that.
1320486609394016260 2020-10-26 06:05:15 +0800 <leemichelle009> @DineshDSouza @drawandstrike It‚Äôs obvious that this is why they have called a lid.
1320483288750972928 2020-10-26 05:52:04 +0800 <leemichelle009> After his outburst yesterday with all the screaming it is obvious why he has been hiding.
1320482771396108288 2020-10-26 05:50:00 +0800 <leemichelle009> They have not surrendered. They have taken every step humanly possible to fight this. In fact, Joe‚Äôs plan now is all the things that @realDonaldTrump has already done. He tried the lockdown and it has been devastating to our country. We have to open up and move forward.
1320468856297693194 2020-10-26 04:54:43 +0800 <leemichelle009> @WarRoomPandemic Show that it definitely ties into Joe Biden. This is the message that needs to get to voters.
1320465551634870277 2020-10-26 04:41:35 +0800 <leemichelle009> What is going on?  Who would vote for him? He is incapable of working.
1320464339090944003 2020-10-26 04:36:46 +0800 <leemichelle009> @TrumpWarRoom Joe Biden is also hiding himself. It is pathetic!
1320452068403011587 2020-10-26 03:48:00 +0800 <leemichelle009> @MichaelDeLauzon It is so risky. Secret service must be losing their minds. He truly is the people‚Äôs President and takes a lot of risks wanting to be with the people.
1320446042488397830 2020-10-26 03:24:03 +0800 <leemichelle009> @CLewandowski_ @LindaSuhler @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden He is hiding from the media.
1320445090960199680 2020-10-26 03:20:17 +0800 <leemichelle009> @GeraldoRivera @JoeBiden @POTUS It does matter to Americans.

1320439674188554240 2020-10-26 02:58:45 +0800 <leemichelle009> @mcuban take him up on it and then announce what you saw
1320436043204710407 2020-10-26 02:44:19 +0800 <leemichelle009> @GeorgePapa19 Unbelievable
1320434587034619910 2020-10-26 02:38:32 +0800 <leemichelle009> @dbongino They are going to cheat and try to steal this from Trump. It is disgraceful.
1320431195499483136 2020-10-26 02:25:04 +0800 <leemichelle009> Get out and vote for @realDonaldTrump
1320418595244068864 2020-10-26 01:34:59 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JonLemire Why is no one else talking about it? It is not normal and the media does not seem to care.
1320417709675470849 2020-10-26 01:31:28 +0800 <leemichelle009> He cannot handle pressure period. Never have witnessed a candidate needing so much help and so many breaks as Joe does.
1320415951007981570 2020-10-26 01:24:29 +0800 <leemichelle009> @wsteaks @CalebJHull @realDonaldTrump works for the American people and this great country. Joe Biden hides away from cameras and doesn‚Äôt want to answer any questions.
1320415429509132288 2020-10-26 01:22:25 +0800 <leemichelle009> @tylerpager @JenniferJJacobs Unbelievable. He is not entitled to votes. He has to earn them.
1320413588130009088 2020-10-26 01:15:06 +0800 <leemichelle009> @hrenee80 Disgusting
1320412564258422784 2020-10-26 01:11:02 +0800 <leemichelle009> This is unreal. Who would vote for him. Something is obviously wrong. Wake up America.
1320410098662068225 2020-10-26 01:01:14 +0800 <leemichelle009> He acts so entitled. He is disgraceful.
1320390909884772352 2020-10-25 23:44:59 +0800 <leemichelle009> Get out and vote for @realDonaldTrump
1320390720654630914 2020-10-25 23:44:14 +0800 <leemichelle009> @realDonaldTrump has been saying this all along. Open the schools!
1320378436880355329 2020-10-25 22:55:25 +0800 <leemichelle009> @maggieNYT Report on Joe being compromised by China, Maggie. Much bigger story.
1320376278571208709 2020-10-25 22:46:50 +0800 <leemichelle009> The only strategy Biden has is to act like the steps that Trump has already taken are his own ideas. It is ridiculous.
1320375054279081986 2020-10-25 22:41:58 +0800 <leemichelle009> Pennsylvania get out and vote for @realDonaldTrump Biden will end the oil industry and raise taxes. Not to mention that he is compromised by China.
1320374572395409408 2020-10-25 22:40:04 +0800 <leemichelle009> @ksenijapavlovic Hope you are right.
1320374476148801543 2020-10-25 22:39:41 +0800 <leemichelle009> @jonathanvswan Why are people reporting on this but can‚Äôt bring themselves to utter a word about Joe Biden being compromised by China?  It is unreal.
1320373823817089025 2020-10-25 22:37:05 +0800 <leemichelle009> @abigailmarone He feels so entitled to votes. It‚Äôs disgusting.
1320373602034831361 2020-10-25 22:36:12 +0800 <leemichelle009> @HW_Floyd @deneenborelli Don‚Äôt let them steal the election. We have to show up in massive numbers.

1320338841606246402 2020-10-25 20:18:05 +0800 <leemichelle009> @HerschelWalker @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @DonaldJTrumpJr @BernardKerik @TheLeoTerrell We cannot trust him. They are going to try and steal the election. Republicans must show up in huge numbers. It‚Äôs the only chance we have.
1320338288390119424 2020-10-25 20:15:53 +0800 <leemichelle009> Get out and vote for @realDonaldTrump. They are going to do everything in their power to steal the election so we have to show up in huge numbers. Bring a group with you.

1320177544596017152 2020-10-25 09:37:09 +0800 <leemichelle009> @CassandraRules I don‚Äôt like the media covering for the creepy Bidens. It is ridiculous. If it were Trump we would never stop hearing about it. It is so disheartening.
1320173659034669057 2020-10-25 09:21:42 +0800 <leemichelle009> @TrumpWarRoom He‚Äôs a disgrace. Trying to figure out a way to hide his corruption crimes. They are going to try and steal this from Trump.
1320164998979747840 2020-10-25 08:47:17 +0800 <leemichelle009> @cjtruth She wants it more than he does. So sad.
1320162310472740865 2020-10-25 08:36:36 +0800 <leemichelle009> @mschlapp Watch for cheating. That‚Äôs the only way they can win.
1320161454604144642 2020-10-25 08:33:12 +0800 <leemichelle009> @EricTrump It‚Äôs so true!  That‚Äôs the only way they can win!  It will be so sad if they steal this away from @realDonaldTrump

1320141660936876033 2020-10-25 07:14:33 +0800 <leemichelle009> @TimMurtaugh Keep getting the word out about Biden making money off his son in China and also ending the oil industry. Locking everything down is a good point too. This is resonating with voters across the US.

1319735230002061312 2020-10-24 04:19:32 +0800 <leemichelle009> @TrumpWarRoom Someone needs to ask him why he is claiming his covid plan is anything different than what @realDonaldTrump has done?
1319734198677241860 2020-10-24 04:15:27 +0800 <leemichelle009> @TrumpWarRoom Someone needs to go through point by point and say how he is taking Trumps plan. Put on social media or make an ad out of it.

1318268192473710599 2020-10-20 03:10:03 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JasonMillerinDC I‚Äôm in a battleground state and seeing and hearing 3-1 Biden ads over Trump on tv and radio. Get your ads going quickly. Blast them everywhere on tv and radio. Biden heavy on radio.
1318249516404002824 2020-10-20 01:55:51 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JasonMillerinDC This is unacceptable to the American people and should be unacceptable to the Trump campaign.
1318220698440126465 2020-10-20 00:01:20 +0800 <leemichelle009> @TrumpWarRoom Unacceptable
1318219113496481792 2020-10-19 23:55:02 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JHoganGidley @realDonaldTrump Disgusting
1318194450380750849 2020-10-19 22:17:02 +0800 <leemichelle009> @DonaldJTrumpJr This is unacceptable. Americans should be fired up. This is ridiculous and we won‚Äôt stand for it.
1318192944772501506 2020-10-19 22:11:03 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JoeConchaTV This is unbelievable. Who accepts a candidate that hides himself away and answers no questions? We are living in the twilight zone.
1318191919017721858 2020-10-19 22:06:58 +0800 <leemichelle009> @jonathanvswan You are a good reporter. Why are you not trying to get all the info on the Hunter Biden story?  Why not keep pressing until you get answers. Stand out and don‚Äôt be like all of these other so called journalists.
1318175301076213763 2020-10-19 21:00:56 +0800 <leemichelle009> @RealJamesWoods That‚Äôs why he had to take a break until Thursday. It‚Äôs exhausting out there!
1318174895939964931 2020-10-19 20:59:20 +0800 <leemichelle009> @DonaldJTrumpJr Trying to retweet and respond to your tweet and getting this message. They are censoring you.  https://t.co/UrSFJqpQNI
1318173866238398466 2020-10-19 20:55:14 +0800 <leemichelle009> @GiannoCaldwell @realDonaldTrump With the cheating, censoring and all out hatred directed towards him, it only makes people support him more. If election is fair he will win.
1318173530345869313 2020-10-19 20:53:54 +0800 <leemichelle009> @FoxNews Of course it‚Äôs not. They are desperate to spin it away!

1318169055648452608 2020-10-19 20:36:07 +0800 <leemichelle009> @trish_regan @JoeBiden Unacceptable
1318169003291037696 2020-10-19 20:35:55 +0800 <leemichelle009> @kilmeade @realDonaldTrump If he is allowed to speak without everyone trying to censor him. Brian look into the Hunter Biden story and report on it on air. Biden must answer what he knew about this. Unacceptable for media to cover it up.
1318160837102764035 2020-10-19 20:03:28 +0800 <leemichelle009> @mattdizwhitlock Hiding in the basement. Such a pathetic sight.
1318153574682103810 2020-10-19 19:34:36 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JoeConchaTV Pathetic.
1318153502418456576 2020-10-19 19:34:19 +0800 <leemichelle009> This is unacceptable. Once again she has framed the questions in a way she thinks will benefit Biden and not @realDonaldTrump. It is pathetic how much help Biden needs. Can he do anything without assistance?
1318018506403840005 2020-10-19 10:37:54 +0800 <leemichelle009> @Feisty_FL Yes!  They never air it. How ironic that they did when Rudy was on.
1317878124646891524 2020-10-19 01:20:04 +0800 <leemichelle009> @LelandVittert Kudos to you for pressing the Biden campaign for answers. Please stay on this story. Seems like there is a lot there.
1317826655600201731 2020-10-18 21:55:33 +0800 <leemichelle009> @MichaelDeLauzon Why did the Trump campaign agree to this? All the moderators are clearly biased.
1317818987347124225 2020-10-18 21:25:05 +0800 <leemichelle009> @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump Is there somewhere we can find where it will be airing in our area?
1317818658048147456 2020-10-18 21:23:46 +0800 <leemichelle009> @DonaldJTrumpJr Don‚Äôt know how, but they will attempt it.
1317813406418804738 2020-10-18 21:02:54 +0800 <leemichelle009> @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump Because it is a positive for Trump. The biased moderator only chose the topics she thought could be used against Trump. It is disgusting.
1317759040894754816 2020-10-18 17:26:52 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JasonMillerinDC Keep it up!  Go vote and bring friends and family with you.

1317636817185800192 2020-10-18 09:21:12 +0800 <leemichelle009> @SWWCreative You are a disgrace!  If she did know you and you wrote a tell all book about your private conversations then you are an even more horrible person.
1317628018697916416 2020-10-18 08:46:14 +0800 <leemichelle009> @MichaelDeLauzon Hope he will rest before the debate.
1317611360684048384 2020-10-18 07:40:03 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JudiciaryGOP He is despicable. What a disgrace.

1317561206165692416 2020-10-18 04:20:45 +0800 <leemichelle009> @DonaldJTrumpJr Why would the Trump campaign agree to this?
1317485774867206144 2020-10-17 23:21:01 +0800 <leemichelle009> He must be asked repeatedly if he disowns this.
1317470434980470786 2020-10-17 22:20:03 +0800 <leemichelle009> @newtgingrich The Trump campaign should have never agreed to this.
1317447345785667586 2020-10-17 20:48:18 +0800 <leemichelle009> @RichardGrenell @JoeBiden @KBeds Do everything to get this out bc they are doing everything to block it.

1316927559502876673 2020-10-16 10:22:52 +0800 <leemichelle009> @TheLeoTerrell @realDonaldTrump Donna is a cheater who gave Hillary debate questions. Why she is still allowed on tv is beyond me. She lost all her credibility years ago.

1316919616158007296 2020-10-16 09:51:18 +0800 <leemichelle009> @DanScavino @TeamTrump Find the woman that was behind Trump nodding along in agreement. She was great and deserves some recognition!!!
1316914052329779200 2020-10-16 09:29:11 +0800 <leemichelle009> @nielslesniewski @GStephanopoulos Basically if he doesn‚Äôt get his way and ACB is confirmed. He will pack the court.
1316913405282947073 2020-10-16 09:26:37 +0800 <leemichelle009> @SavannahGuthrie  You came across as nothing more than a political hack. I am done watching you. Very disappointed.
1316911611484012544 2020-10-16 09:19:29 +0800 <leemichelle009> Love this lady!  Let‚Äôs find her!  Retweet!!!!

1316901365298454528 2020-10-16 08:38:46 +0800 <leemichelle009> @KatiePavlich Another biased moderator
1316844293206794244 2020-10-16 04:51:59 +0800 <leemichelle009> @brianstelter I will give you credit for calling this out. Now also report on some of the other major stories that are not favorable to Biden.
1316843684118368263 2020-10-16 04:49:34 +0800 <leemichelle009> @johnrobertsFox Do you apologize to @realDonaldTrump for defending Scully?
1316832061374726144 2020-10-16 04:03:23 +0800 <leemichelle009> @johnrobertsFox you owe @realDonaldTrump an apology for pumping up Steve Scully last week. He is disgusting. If you are a real journalist you will apologize. How much more does it take for you to actually recognize on air the bias against the President?
1316830297690959872 2020-10-16 03:56:23 +0800 <leemichelle009> @SavannahGuthrie this is your chance to prove that you are a world class journalist. Not an anti Trumper.
1316829603013550080 2020-10-16 03:53:37 +0800 <leemichelle009> @BretBaier Americans do care and would not have minimized it if Scully had admitted it. He like many are biased against Trump and Americans are tired of it. We will settle it at the polls, but you owe @realDonaldTrump an apology for defending Scully. Are you an honest journalist?
1316828813720985604 2020-10-16 03:50:29 +0800 <leemichelle009> @debates you owe @realDonaldTrump an apology. This is ridiculous and has ruined your credibility.
1316827606231199746 2020-10-16 03:45:41 +0800 <leemichelle009> This is despicable. This is why we need to go out and vote in droves. We have this, twitter censorship, everyone doing all possible to take down Trump. Patriots show up and vote to support @realDonaldTrump
1316826987193929729 2020-10-16 03:43:13 +0800 <leemichelle009> @DonaldJTrumpJr Despicable
1316746832467447808 2020-10-15 22:24:43 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JohnBasham Not if we are censored.
1316746248255426561 2020-10-15 22:22:24 +0800 <leemichelle009> @ksorbs After this censoring stunt I really do. Any fair minded American should be outraged.
1316735716836155393 2020-10-15 21:40:33 +0800 <leemichelle009> @BuckSexton It‚Äôs a crazy time indeed, but the censorship is infuriating.
1316735274462961665 2020-10-15 21:38:47 +0800 <leemichelle009> Get outraged. Get a group of friends and go vote early. Let‚Äôs show them that Americans will not stand for this censorship.
1316734090905780227 2020-10-15 21:34:05 +0800 <leemichelle009> @adamhousley Christopher Wray is useless.
1316725002192982016 2020-10-15 20:57:58 +0800 <leemichelle009> @BretBaier Expose the horrific censorship of @Twitter and @Facebook to cover for Biden. This is despicable and all Americans should be outraged that censorship is happening in the United States.
1316724324938723328 2020-10-15 20:55:17 +0800 <leemichelle009> @RoscoeBDavis1 They will censor so we will never know.
1316722905980567553 2020-10-15 20:49:38 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JackPosobiec They will censor it so no one can read it.
1316712587552321536 2020-10-15 20:08:38 +0800 <leemichelle009> @GStephanopoulos if you have any shred of dignity left you will question Joe Biden about his son and their dealings and have tough follow up questions.
1316711689220390912 2020-10-15 20:05:04 +0800 <leemichelle009> @ByronYork Despicable
1316711139313684480 2020-10-15 20:02:53 +0800 <leemichelle009> @marc_lotter Everyone should be outraged about this.

1316703039554813952 2020-10-15 19:30:42 +0800 <leemichelle009> @ddale8 @ChrisMegerian Why don‚Äôt you report on the Hunter Biden story instead of this nonsense?
1316702788810928133 2020-10-15 19:29:42 +0800 <leemichelle009> @Heminator @drawandstrike It says they are all anti Trump and trying to censor the information the American people receive.
1316702002446045184 2020-10-15 19:26:35 +0800 <leemichelle009> @DineshDSouza Unbelievable. Every American should be outraged.
1316701565185597440 2020-10-15 19:24:50 +0800 <leemichelle009> @bdomenech @nypost This is censorship and it is despicable. Every American should be outraged, no matter what side of the aisle you are on.
1316701305520508928 2020-10-15 19:23:49 +0800 <leemichelle009> @Timcast It‚Äôs disgusting. They allowed Trump‚Äôs hacked tax returns and were happy to spread those far and wide.
1316700906096820225 2020-10-15 19:22:13 +0800 <leemichelle009> @GamebredFighter @realDonaldTrump Thank you for supporting President Trump.
1316584487858442240 2020-10-15 11:39:37 +0800 <leemichelle009> @MichaelDeLauzon Unfortunately you are probably correct!  This is infuriating.
1316578125426368512 2020-10-15 11:14:20 +0800 <leemichelle009> @RichardGrenell There are none!  Where are the civil libertarians?

1316547294637027331 2020-10-15 09:11:49 +0800 <leemichelle009> @MichaelDeLauzon This is disgusting.  Never thought this would be happening in America.
1316545214186741761 2020-10-15 09:03:33 +0800 <leemichelle009> @jack stop the censorship.
1316544892382908417 2020-10-15 09:02:17 +0800 <leemichelle009> @HawleyMO @Twitter @jack @Facebook They allow and encourage negative information against @realDonaldTrump. It is censorship of a political candidate. Every promoted ad  on my feed is pro Biden. Disgusting.
1316541577054040065 2020-10-15 08:49:06 +0800 <leemichelle009> @jack @nypost You guys are disgusting censors of free speech. You allow numerous articles with unverified information against @realDonaldTrump every minute of every day. This is unacceptable.
1316526595100872706 2020-10-15 07:49:34 +0800 <leemichelle009> @BuckSexton They are desperate for Joe to win!
1316522113537380352 2020-10-15 07:31:46 +0800 <leemichelle009> @DonaldJTrumpJr I was trying to retweet Rudy and the whole thing disappeared.

1316520706482622467 2020-10-15 07:26:10 +0800 <leemichelle009> Please retweet so everyone can read this story of Biden‚Äôs corruption.

1316382648751849475 2020-10-14 22:17:35 +0800 <leemichelle009> The @debates commission‚Äôs decision to not allow the debate to go on as planned when 175 doctors said @realDonaldTrump is not contagious is indefensible and can only be seen as pro Biden.

1316092878880415745 2020-10-14 03:06:08 +0800 <leemichelle009> @TimMurtaugh This is obvious. Dems are desperate and they are using him.
1316023873800818701 2020-10-13 22:31:56 +0800 <leemichelle009> @TrumpWarRoom Twitter is censoring everything about @realDonaldTrump and promoting Biden. It is a disgrace.

1315628012696727552 2020-10-12 20:18:56 +0800 <leemichelle009> @catturd2 This is just their excuse to rig the election. They know he is going to lose so they create fake polls so they can add millions of votes to his total. This is terrifying.
1315626277144080384 2020-10-12 20:12:02 +0800 <leemichelle009> @realDonaldTrump It is disgusting. So unacceptable to the American people.
1315625692843958272 2020-10-12 20:09:42 +0800 <leemichelle009> @marklevinshow Why does he get away with this behavior?

1315299362109640704 2020-10-11 22:32:59 +0800 <leemichelle009> @ChadPergram Give me a break. Trump has the power to appoint. It is in the constitution. Just Dems realizing that Joe is in trouble over not answering this and trying to put out a talking point.
1315298895719792645 2020-10-11 22:31:08 +0800 <leemichelle009> @jonathanvswan How about interviews with Joe Biden or Kamala Harris. Have you tried to get those?
1315298571311349760 2020-10-11 22:29:51 +0800 <leemichelle009> This is ridiculous. It is clearly in the constitution that the President has the power to appoint a new Justice when there is a vacancy. Does Biden even understand the constitution?

1314589792466800641 2020-10-09 23:33:25 +0800 <leemichelle009> If Biden doesn‚Äôt have to answer on Court packing why do they have to answer on testing?
1314589285576773636 2020-10-09 23:31:24 +0800 <leemichelle009> @seanspicer Why would you speak up for a guy who tweeted never Trump a few years ago?  He is far from unbiased.
1314588980785098752 2020-10-09 23:30:11 +0800 <leemichelle009> @seanspicer @SteveScully @cspan @debates Scaramucci said he thought is was legit so that is why he responded. What does that tell you Sean?  Scully tweeted never Trump several years ago on his acct?  Was that a hacking too? He is far from unbiased.
1314584705824681984 2020-10-09 23:13:12 +0800 <leemichelle009> @yashar She‚Äôs a bitter woman.

How can you not answer how you would deal with an important election issue? If this were @realDonaldTrump people would be going crazy. Americans demand to know his position.

1314181299108753408 2020-10-08 20:30:12 +0800 <leemichelle009> @HallieJackson Its unacceptable. This year more than ever Americans deserve a real debate with an unbiased moderator between @realDonaldTrump and @JoeBiden We do not want to see anyone reading from a teleprompter. Move it outside or by a day or two, put them 20 ft apart. Anything but virtual.
1314180392958799873 2020-10-08 20:26:36 +0800 <leemichelle009> @GeoffRBennett @costareports Not acceptable.

The doctors say 10 days if you test negative and this would be day 13 for Trump.   Americans deserve a real debate. Not virtual where Joe reads from his teleprompter.

1312802418820894720 2020-10-05 01:11:01 +0800 <leemichelle009> @KayaJones Why does no one ask about her. People do care about @FLOTUS as well. She should release a video.
1312796672225935363 2020-10-05 00:48:11 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JackPosobiec It is like she doesn‚Äôt exist. No one mentions her. So strange. Also what about Barron. Both his parents have COVID 19.

1312463773442035712 2020-10-04 02:45:22 +0800 <leemichelle009> @PastorDScott @realDonaldTrump Someone targeted him and the GOP due to timing. Election and Supreme Court. He has been on the road at rallies and events the whole time but gets sick now?

Timing right before the election and Supreme Ct. nomination. Trump has done rallies and events throughout the pandemic with no issues until now? Seems suspicious.

1312401470189383681 2020-10-03 22:37:48 +0800 <leemichelle009> @atensnut Definitely an attack on Trump, the GOP and Supreme Ct nomination. All these rallies and events for months with no issues. Timing is suspect to say the least.
1312390266595274754 2020-10-03 21:53:17 +0800 <leemichelle009> @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Was this a deliberate attack on Trump and GOP to interfere with election and Supreme Court?
1312389053564813312 2020-10-03 21:48:28 +0800 <leemichelle009> @CBS_Herridge @CBSNews Is this an attack on Trump and the GOP right before election and Supreme Court nomination?  Trump has done rallies and events for months with no issues.
1312388321000198145 2020-10-03 21:45:33 +0800 <leemichelle009> Could this have been an attack on Trump and the GOP right before election and to stop Supreme Court Nominee?  Timing here is very interesting.

1312053013738074116 2020-10-02 23:33:09 +0800 <leemichelle009> @Rasmussen_Poll Trump was debating Wallace and Biden. It is unfortunate that it was 2 against 1. So disgusting to watch Wallace try to help Biden and do everything in his power to hurt Trump.

1311755994876309504 2020-10-02 03:52:55 +0800 <leemichelle009> @johnrobertsFox you and Chris Wallace should help Biden prepare for the next debate.
1311755351033868289 2020-10-02 03:50:21 +0800 <leemichelle009> @PastorDScott @realDonaldTrump He had to interrupt because he was debating Biden and Wallace. Neither wanted him to be heard. Biden interrupted as well but was mostly allowed to answer his questions where Trump was not. Wallace was on team Biden.
1311752403939667968 2020-10-02 03:38:38 +0800 <leemichelle009> @BillHemmer why do you allow Chris Wallace to come on and trash @realDonaldTrump ? Wallace is team Biden and it is obvious.

1311317576551731200 2020-09-30 22:50:48 +0800 <leemichelle009> @BrockStetson1 @MichaelDeLauzon That‚Äôs what i am thinking. Biden ads everywhere and unfortunately just not seeing many tv ads and hearing no radio ads for Trump. Can‚Äôt stand Biden but they are saturating the airwaves. Trump campaign would be smart to try and counter it as now it is pretty much unchallenged.
1311315777363095553 2020-09-30 22:43:39 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JedediahBila @FoxNewsSunday It also should not be his job to show bias against @realDonaldTrump He is a disgrace. Coddled Biden for the entire debate. Disgusting

1311298793493663744 2020-09-30 21:36:09 +0800 <leemichelle009> @MichaelDeLauzon Not for debate. Are they seeing ads?  Why are we not seeing any Trump ads in battleground states? I am a small account but u have a much larger platform. Trump campaign needs to know there are probably 4-1 Biden ads on tv and radio. I am just wondering why.
1311298265430872064 2020-09-30 21:34:03 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JaniceDean Because of Chris Wallace and his bias against Trump.
1311297558938095617 2020-09-30 21:31:15 +0800 <leemichelle009> @MichaelDeLauzon Can you take a poll of your followers?  I am in a battleground state and seeing little to no ads on tv and none on radio for Trump. Bombarded with Biden ads all over tv and radio. Just wondering why the Trump campaign is not blanketing the airwaves?

1311274213332987905 2020-09-30 19:58:29 +0800 <leemichelle009> @AndrewCMcCarthy Chris Wallace should be fired. He showed such absolute bias towards Biden and was very unprofessional with his comments and setting up the questions for Joe. What is this?  Is there no one who can be impartial towards @realDonaldTrump?
1311271044846686209 2020-09-30 19:45:53 +0800 <leemichelle009> @seanspicer Chris Wallace fans that watched him coddle Biden.

1311268570450604035 2020-09-30 19:36:04 +0800 <leemichelle009> @WayneDupreeShow He is a disgrace. Never letting Trump talk and chastizing him but coddling Joe and setting up the questions for him. Just pathetic.
1311268087627472897 2020-09-30 19:34:08 +0800 <leemichelle009> @DavidWohl @FoxNews He was disgusting and his absolute bias against Trump was on full display.

1311132397937848321 2020-09-30 10:34:57 +0800 <leemichelle009> @BretBaier Chris Wallace obviously wanted Joe to win!
1311129395730567169 2020-09-30 10:23:02 +0800 <leemichelle009> @LisaMarieBoothe Chris Wallace won‚Äôt allow Trump to talk about it. Coddling Joe.
1311129138904928256 2020-09-30 10:22:00 +0800 <leemichelle009> @AndrewCMcCarthy Disgraceful

1311127314558865409 2020-09-30 10:14:46 +0800 <leemichelle009> @AndrewCMcCarthy Chris Wallace is a disgrace. His bias is on full display. Won‚Äôt let Trump answer and doesn‚Äôt press Biden on anything. It is embarrassing. This will only help Trump bc it is so obvious.

1311040413499883532 2020-09-30 04:29:27 +0800 <leemichelle009> @JasonMillerinDC Not seeing any ads on tv and radio for trump. All are Biden. We are in a battleground state. Why?
1311038985410670593 2020-09-30 04:23:46 +0800 <leemichelle009> @kevincorke @ODNIgov This is disgusting behavior. Such a disgrace to our country and a waste of time for all Americans. Will anyone be held responsible for these actions or is it okay because they were anti-@realDonaldTrump ?
1311008059007873024 2020-09-30 02:20:53 +0800 <leemichelle009> @dcexaminer @KBeds Probably doesn‚Äôt need an earpiece if he has been given all the questions.
1310947372701282305 2020-09-29 22:19:44 +0800 <leemichelle009> @realDonaldTrump asked for a drug test before debate, asked for them to be checked for ear piece. Joe asked for breaks every 30 minutes during a 90 min debate. This tells you all you need to know. Why does the media not care and why does the Trump campaign not publicize this?
1310944656742645760 2020-09-29 22:08:56 +0800 <leemichelle009> @EamonJavers Hollywood types do nothing to sway votes. Ask Hillary.
1310916085617754112 2020-09-29 20:15:25 +0800 <leemichelle009> @ErinMPerrine Unfortunately not seeing many Trump ads on tv or radio. Every minute there is a Biden ad. You guys need to get more on tv and radio.
1310907561902837764 2020-09-29 19:41:32 +0800 <leemichelle009> @AndrewCMcCarthy @wjmcgurn No. Joe will not be asked much of anything.

They had and ad, stickers, etc ready to go. It is such an obvious hit job but no one calls Biden out. So frustrating for the American people who are tired of all this.
1310612649235881985 2020-09-29 00:09:40 +0800 <leemichelle009> @Mediaite He is a never Trumper so I am sure he will do anything he can to help Joe.

How could this man possibly be President?  He can‚Äôt even hold a full schedule?  Call him out. It is a disgrace to Americans.
1310593849497092096 2020-09-28 22:54:58 +0800 <leemichelle009> @RichardGrenell Wray must go!  They are still out to cover their tracks and take down @realDonaldTrump

1310269994874408965 2020-09-28 01:28:05 +0800 <leemichelle009> Will reporters continue to press him on this and will Chris Wallace ask for an answer during the debate?  Let‚Äôs hope so.

1305474499127771136 2020-09-14 19:52:29 +0800 <leemichelle009> @AriFleischer Check out the Las Vegas strip Ari. Thousands of people. Is that a bad idea?  Why is no one bringing attention to that or calling those people out?  Such a double standard for Trump supporters.

1304885108546121732 2020-09-13 04:50:28 +0800 <leemichelle009> @jsolomonReports They will only cover for Mueller and his shady team. It is disgusting.
1304884722452094979 2020-09-13 04:48:56 +0800 <leemichelle009> @kathrynw5 Because he absolutely cannot outwork Trump.

1304152181428322306 2020-09-11 04:18:04 +0800 <leemichelle009> @markknoller Why are all your tweets leaning towards being anti Trump lately?  You used to be much better when you appeared neutral.
1304073259282038784 2020-09-10 23:04:28 +0800 <leemichelle009> @markknoller Trump is on camera everyday taking qusetions from the media. Obama did not.

1302632492713865217 2020-09-06 23:39:22 +0800 <leemichelle009> @BretBaier Please call him out on the air and say to the American people that you ask everyday but he refuses to take questions and do interviews. If @realDonaldTrump did this you would be reporting it as a top story.

Wish more people would have the courage do this when they hear fake news.
