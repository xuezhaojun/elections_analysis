1344026015446679552 2020-12-30 05:02:27 +0800 <Camelback71> Who wants to bet Brian never registered the vapors when it came to throwing trillions of dollars at pointless wars with no end and thousands of young Americans dead?
1343990736082018304 2020-12-30 02:42:16 +0800 <Camelback71> I'll take an auction that actually benefits the American people over a taxpayer spigot that is never turned off to fund pointless forever wars in the Middle East and elsewhere.
1343983831431319552 2020-12-30 02:14:50 +0800 <Camelback71> There's a big difference between socialism as put into practice in Western Europe since before World War II, in the United States since 1965 and other places around the world post-1945 and totalitarian Communism.  The gaslighting clowns at PragerU are conflating the two.
1343982189407395841 2020-12-30 02:08:18 +0800 <Camelback71> @mandie_312 I've gotten a ton of great deals from gyms like Orangetheory and other corporate clubs but all of them are all-in on the "mask" in Arizona. The only ones that do not are the mom and pop studios and (1) they're not easy to find, (2) they can only use word of mouth to advertise.
1343974332670754818 2020-12-30 01:37:05 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya @KurtSchlichter that GOP Senate majority is soooo WORTH it!
1343974070602199040 2020-12-30 01:36:02 +0800 <Camelback71> The system is broken, Ari. How long are you going to make excuses for such a system?

1343950023843692546 2020-12-30 00:00:29 +0800 <Camelback71> I'm pretty sure the people of Eastern Europe came to a much different conclusion by 1950.
1343947032793292800 2020-12-29 23:48:36 +0800 <Camelback71> @TianaTheFirst has been one of the bigger supporters of masks (that don't work), social distancing nonsense and lockdowns.
1343941947937882114 2020-12-29 23:28:24 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos How does anyone who has lived through the last thirty years of American politics have a hard time knowing the intentions of the Democrat Party to any degree of certainty? You have to be willfully blind to come up with that nonsense.
1343915125942566912 2020-12-29 21:41:49 +0800 <Camelback71> Since 1965, America has been governed under the rules of the New Constitution.  Such rules demand racial, ethnic and gender groups benefit from such classifications. All, except one: White males.
1343913538931159040 2020-12-29 21:35:31 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos If system is irretrievably broken (and it is), only a fool plays by the rules of such system.
1343890300876406784 2020-12-29 20:03:10 +0800 <Camelback71> Who's she kidding? America has been a socialist country for over 50 years. "Socialism" appears to be the last arrow left in the GOP with any kind of power to gaslight the rubes.

1343886327922655234 2020-12-29 19:47:23 +0800 <Camelback71> It's all Kabuki theatre, both in Washington and in State capitals. That's the reality. Your entire Twitter feed lives in an intellectual fantasy world. Mastriano is one man, an outlier. The vast majority of state GOP elected officials are right with McConnell.
1343739165293203456 2020-12-29 10:02:37 +0800 <Camelback71> This is pathetic.
1343738565025382400 2020-12-29 10:00:14 +0800 <Camelback71> It's laughable you think the GOP is some bulwark against the bad direction Democrats want to take the country. Especially considering no state GOP legislatures did ANYTHING to end the Covid tyranny or truly challenge the election fraud.
1343737754761326598 2020-12-29 09:57:00 +0800 <Camelback71> @DelargeArthur @demontage2000 It doesn't matter how much Americans have learned in the last two months about electoral fraud. Half the country has no representation at either the federal, state and even most local levels of government that will DO anything about it.
1343653574358679552 2020-12-29 04:22:30 +0800 <Camelback71> So you're hunky dory with this multi-ethnic, multi-racial trainwreck America has become since 1965?
1343653058631200768 2020-12-29 04:20:27 +0800 <Camelback71> @VDAREJamesK Not surprisingly, Lincoln hated him and his accomplishments. If the Whigs and Lincoln had their way, Mexico would stretch to the Canadian border everywhere west of the Missouri River, save for Texas.
1343646108673691648 2020-12-29 03:52:50 +0800 <Camelback71> Really, how is half the country expected to co-exist with these awful people?
1343603017388441601 2020-12-29 01:01:36 +0800 <Camelback71> Trump damaged his legacy by signing the Covid relief bill. The election was rife with fraud that affected the outcome and this clown and @ScottMcConnell9 still think the system "works".

1343528772457250816 2020-12-28 20:06:35 +0800 <Camelback71> It's laughable you think Biden is weakened by whatever happens in the Senate next week. The overton window continues to shift leftward regardless of how weak Biden is.
1343528181941166082 2020-12-28 20:04:14 +0800 <Camelback71> No, Murkowski is safe. Enough Democrats will vote for her even if she's successfully primaried like last time.

There's nothing "voluntary" about America's capitalist system when it comes to big business.

1341206093985300480 2020-12-22 10:17:05 +0800 <Camelback71> Fox and the establishment GOP is telling its voters it's 2014 again. And there's nothing you can do about it.
1341202483150929920 2020-12-22 10:02:44 +0800 <Camelback71> It's always socialism with these annoying libertarians. Not a one understands the politics of demographic change.

1341099480951660544 2020-12-22 03:13:27 +0800 <Camelback71> They aren't rich Republican whites at this point.  They're Democrats.

1341094688200134656 2020-12-22 02:54:24 +0800 <Camelback71> Almost every US politico and officeholder up until the Civil War and nearly 100 years after was a racist in one form or another and nearly 50% of the country even after the Civil War could be branded a traitor.

It was always a seasonal immunity and the health officials in Sweden understood this.  Bloomberg is arguing in bad faith here.

1340765247099994113 2020-12-21 05:05:19 +0800 <Camelback71> @LibertyCell1 No argument. But don't think it didn't happen on both sides. The natives were conquered. End of story.
1340764274013003776 2020-12-21 05:01:27 +0800 <Camelback71> I might welcome the Russians at this point.

1340671436764016641 2020-12-20 22:52:33 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos Unfortunately Kendi's line of thinking is where the post-1964 New Constitution is ultimately taking the US and its government. And it's what the "6-3 conservative" Supreme Court will ultimately codify. The only solution to this is the total destruction of the New Constitution.

1339826579254304768 2020-12-18 14:55:23 +0800 <Camelback71> Someone else still obesses over your dad. And honey, most GOP voters despise your father.

1339824159233200134 2020-12-18 14:45:46 +0800 <Camelback71> You can't control the spread of an airborne virus.

1339677261474099201 2020-12-18 05:02:03 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos I see Rousseau nodding in approval in hell.  He alone among the Enlightenment philosphers knew liberalism was the Christmas gift of a lifetime to degenerates.

For those unfamiliar with those terms, I say again read Christopher Caldwell's "The Age of Entitlement" and get it for every other Trump voter on your Christmas list.

1339020712095350785 2020-12-16 09:33:10 +0800 <Camelback71> DeSantis reads the room better than any Republican in elected office.
1338963630583246849 2020-12-16 05:46:20 +0800 <Camelback71> Giving Mitch McConnell a majority isn't productive.  This is though.

1338955144646389760 2020-12-16 05:12:37 +0800 <Camelback71> The system is broken.  If you can't see that, you're simply a useful idiot for the establishment parties in Washington and state capitals.  Biden should be from now on known as and addressed as "His Fraudulency".

1338913494289137664 2020-12-16 02:27:07 +0800 <Camelback71> All elected Republicans shouldn't even acknowledge he's President. He should be referred to as "His Fraudulency" at every turn. The ones that do will never get my vote again. If you endorse this farce you are every bit a collaborator in it.
1338912309192736768 2020-12-16 02:22:24 +0800 <Camelback71> America doesn't have time for zig-zagging steps. It should alarm you that even Tom Cotton and Bob Goodlatte have hardly said a word about their immigration bills since 2017. It's Kabuki theatre Mark and you know it.

1338891159142207489 2020-12-16 00:58:22 +0800 <Camelback71> If they do, the GOP is dead.  And no GOP voter should vote in the GA runoff.  Waste of time. These people don't represent GOP voters.
1338890904342462465 2020-12-16 00:57:21 +0800 <Camelback71> Boycott the GOP.  Boycott the Georgia election runoff.  Stop voting for these people.  They don't represent you.
1338885676201168898 2020-12-16 00:36:35 +0800 <Camelback71> Rule Britainnia
1338885259849388033 2020-12-16 00:34:55 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, a jobs program for more Ivy League-educated lawyers.
1338885027136897024 2020-12-16 00:34:00 +0800 <Camelback71> After 18 months, this is looking more like a jobs program for Ivy League-educated lawyers and less like an actual criminal investigation.
1338671301771186176 2020-12-15 10:24:44 +0800 <Camelback71> Looking for the truth by gaslighting your audience for months. Heroic.
1338663830927228928 2020-12-15 09:55:03 +0800 <Camelback71> Nobody has a problem with you being a vector of stupidity.
1338663660936282113 2020-12-15 09:54:22 +0800 <Camelback71> "Science"...
1338663530526986241 2020-12-15 09:53:51 +0800 <Camelback71> She's the only one who thinks that is a perfect description of the work she does. ü§°
1338662730333483009 2020-12-15 09:50:40 +0800 <Camelback71> Right @adamhousley ... ü•¥
1338619015569104896 2020-12-15 06:56:58 +0800 <Camelback71> Good riddance.
1338587149482921984 2020-12-15 04:50:20 +0800 <Camelback71> Everything with these bastards is about "appearances". They don't care to actually achieve victories for the right. They simply want others to think good things about them.
1338582915286847488 2020-12-15 04:33:31 +0800 <Camelback71> Keep in mind anybody slightly less extreme than Farrakhan is in the American political mainstream.  When Guy assesses the right, anybody to the right of Mitt Romney is an extremist.
1338530817472008192 2020-12-15 01:06:30 +0800 <Camelback71> None of this money ever finds itself going to actual small businesses.  It more often than not goes to politically-connected businesses no person could honestly label "small".
1338530425329762314 2020-12-15 01:04:56 +0800 <Camelback71> The only way the establishment GOP gets the message GOP voters are done being a rubber stamp for the GOP donors' agenda is to boycott the vote and have them lose.  Over and over again if need be.  The progressive agenda is going to get implemented regardless of some GOP majority.
1338510182079365120 2020-12-14 23:44:30 +0800 <Camelback71> This is another reason Trump finds himself fighting an uphill battle to right the wrongs of this election.  VP Pence and the coronavirus task force was a big mistake.
1338509657942331400 2020-12-14 23:42:25 +0800 <Camelback71> McCain vowed to build a border wall so many times in his reelection bids one loses count.  One thing GOP voters should have learned over the last 20 years it's that promises made by GOP candidates are worthless.
1338507752612622336 2020-12-14 23:34:51 +0800 <Camelback71> At least 4 GOP Senators - and probably 3 or 4 more less vocal members -  are sympathetic to a full-scale amnesty.  A GOP majority of 2 won't do much to stop that anyways.  Wake up.
1338473444413906944 2020-12-14 21:18:31 +0800 <Camelback71> That will stop the fraud! üòÇü§£üòÇü§£

1338288348679426048 2020-12-14 09:03:01 +0800 <Camelback71> @civiltwilight42 Pirate McCain is just that. He's not a national populist but a Bush Republican. Continuing to participate in a system that props up the current Senate GOP is foolish and counterproductive.
1338286385405468673 2020-12-14 08:55:13 +0800 <Camelback71> If this guy is pushing the vote in GA, boycott it. He's a fraud.
1338241491576053760 2020-12-14 05:56:49 +0800 <Camelback71> Alger Hiss was an America citizen too. In what sense was he American?  No sense.

1338141198243012610 2020-12-13 23:18:17 +0800 <Camelback71> Thanks to President Trump.
1338140974321717250 2020-12-13 23:17:24 +0800 <Camelback71> The Democrats cheated in Milwaukee, Detroit, Philadelphia and Atlanta. Swing state urban areas. They didn't cheat in deep blue states like New York, California, and Massachusetts. Now say goodbye to the hand. ‚úã

1338118128799105024 2020-12-13 21:46:37 +0800 <Camelback71> So what? He didn't come close to winning any of those heavily blue areas.
1338117250725728256 2020-12-13 21:43:08 +0800 <Camelback71> Don't bet on it. He's a fraud on such issues.
1338115846103650304 2020-12-13 21:37:33 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao.
1338115493643788288 2020-12-13 21:36:09 +0800 <Camelback71> The Republican Party needs to suffer a fast death. The sooner the better.
1338115192966672384 2020-12-13 21:34:57 +0800 <Camelback71> True. But won't happen.
1338114803101884418 2020-12-13 21:33:24 +0800 <Camelback71> @MeerkatYitz Dream on. Trump governed like a Bush Republican and took pandering to minorities to such a level he lost a good percentage of the White vote. The "multi-ethnic, multi-racial working class party" is PC nonsense dressed up for mainstream media pandering.
1337991915979960321 2020-12-13 13:25:06 +0800 <Camelback71> That's not the reason or a reason the bill needs scrapped. All legal immigration needs to stop. Period.
1337990442822946816 2020-12-13 13:19:14 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos For that to happen there needs to be a wholesale change of elected Republicans at the state and federal level. For that to happen base voters need to boycott elections where Bush Republicans are the only game in town and vote for populist candidates looking to unseat the Bushies.
1337988537908486146 2020-12-13 13:11:40 +0800 <Camelback71> She doesn't give two shits.
1337988065118232582 2020-12-13 13:09:47 +0800 <Camelback71> That's not saying much.
1337963038498951168 2020-12-13 11:30:21 +0800 <Camelback71> @GaviShapiro @BigJebBos Finding them all is egregious. America needs to put a stop to the foreign welfare to these nations.  None of them are poor, especially Israel, which has no business even accepting that money anymore.
1337935077116792833 2020-12-13 09:39:14 +0800 <Camelback71> This is bullshit. The nurses aren't overworked. The hospitals are not overflowing.
1337861776944160768 2020-12-13 04:47:58 +0800 <Camelback71> See Kurt Schlichter...

1337857578663960577 2020-12-13 04:31:17 +0800 <Camelback71> In 1955 America lived under the Old Constitution. Since 1964, Americans have been living under an ever expansive and intrusive unofficial New Constitution.  https://t.co/SMqZh4JEOa
1337778786884960257 2020-12-12 23:18:12 +0800 <Camelback71> Lowry is a stenographer for the controlled opposition. And after 1999, Buckley was too.
1337764752362098693 2020-12-12 22:22:26 +0800 <Camelback71> He's not wrong. The blame for Trump's troubles today can be traced back to how he ACTUALLY governed and WHO he actually hired and fired.
1337760792045711361 2020-12-12 22:06:41 +0800 <Camelback71> They won't save Trump, either.

1337759003753889793 2020-12-12 21:59:35 +0800 <Camelback71> @LibertyHangout The historic American nation only lasted 225 years, give or take a few third world immigrants. It only lasted as a superpower for 45 years. Buying cheap shit at Walmart, hollowing out one's working class and fighting Israel's proxy wars in the ME does not a superpower make.
1337757056669872130 2020-12-12 21:51:51 +0800 <Camelback71> F*** you.
1337756888117596161 2020-12-12 21:51:11 +0800 <Camelback71> Dream on. GOP voters may well be but the current crop of elected Republicans aren't the party of the working class.
1337755858751508482 2020-12-12 21:47:05 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, a GOP Senate majority will really  hold the line.
1337755510649438208 2020-12-12 21:45:42 +0800 <Camelback71> Most businesses outside of banks and federal agencies will treat it like Columbus Day and make their employees still come to work.
1337753875848126465 2020-12-12 21:39:12 +0800 <Camelback71> Stop being naive.
1337752710569869313 2020-12-12 21:34:35 +0800 <Camelback71> If the 1965 Immigration Act had never happened the average American could recite all those tall tales.
1337751444640821254 2020-12-12 21:29:33 +0800 <Camelback71> F*** off.
1337651322242310144 2020-12-12 14:51:42 +0800 <Camelback71> Dungpile Skanker weighs in...
1337650506513039361 2020-12-12 14:48:27 +0800 <Camelback71> Talk about failing to read the room.
1337649802813657088 2020-12-12 14:45:39 +0800 <Camelback71> What's bizarre is you thinking the "Union" is worth preserving.
1337648402083901440 2020-12-12 14:40:06 +0800 <Camelback71> To actually answer this question you have to realize there is no "us".
1337574709211222017 2020-12-12 09:47:16 +0800 <Camelback71> This is your brain stuck on stupid.

1337565482103148547 2020-12-12 09:10:36 +0800 <Camelback71> Fuck off. And fuck this political party.
1337565243141050368 2020-12-12 09:09:39 +0800 <Camelback71> If our side doesn't get it even after tonight, let me spell it out for you. Nobody is coming to save Trump. Nobody.  If your government won't give 50% of those that live under it a fair shake, there is only one solution. And it isn't Ted Cruz tweets.

1337529683848560641 2020-12-12 06:48:21 +0800 <Camelback71> It's now that land of future Democrat voters, Antifa street thugs and woke capital fascism. Congrats.
1337499563406475267 2020-12-12 04:48:40 +0800 <Camelback71> The museums honor the wrong ethnics.  Change one or the other to honor subcontinental Indians and he'll fast track that sucker.
1337496046990028805 2020-12-12 04:34:41 +0800 <Camelback71> Time is of the essence.  The electors vote on Tuesday and this is the excuse barfed up by the Republican Senate majority leader in Arizona.
1337494756310437888 2020-12-12 04:29:34 +0800 <Camelback71> Don't be fooled.  They're still Bush Republicans.  For every good bill they somehow manage to pass, 2 more bad bills are on the docket and waiting for a rubber stamp.
1337486849573457921 2020-12-12 03:58:08 +0800 <Camelback71> Whatever America is in 2020, it's certainly not a democracy.
1337470219803971586 2020-12-12 02:52:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Nonsense. If we reached 70% herd immunity (antibodies, cross reactive and T-cells) during both the Spring and Summer waves of 2020, there should be no need for masks at all after the vaccine. Masks don't work as it is.
1337469004336615424 2020-12-12 02:47:14 +0800 <Camelback71> New Yorkers vote for this year in and year out.  Sorry, I can't be made to care.
1337468009523212288 2020-12-12 02:43:17 +0800 <Camelback71> Fake news.  People dying with the WuFlu isn't the same thing as dying FROM it.
1337464229297750016 2020-12-12 02:28:15 +0800 <Camelback71> Now let's do the hundred or so urban shithole sections that pockmark all the blue cities in America.  Ya, those welfare-dependent red states look like Santa Monica don't they?
1337450644400087040 2020-12-12 01:34:16 +0800 <Camelback71> @RonColeman @ScottAdamsSays Why do conservatives constantly play this game of "we should play by the rules even if the left doesn't."  That's what losers do Ron.  Losers.
1337450355525709829 2020-12-12 01:33:08 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos Another leftist parasite who used conservative media to gain a "prestigious" gig on the New York Times' editorial page.  You'll never guess who he wrote for before making it "big"...
1337438883693252608 2020-12-12 00:47:32 +0800 <Camelback71> This is nonsense. Not "everyone is in the hospital" and hospitals are routinely near capacity this time of year due to the flu.
1337435577340194816 2020-12-12 00:34:24 +0800 <Camelback71> I don't have much sympathy for those who support the ridiculous lockdowns and mask wearing and pass it off as science. The virus has a 99.8% survival rate. Reap what you sow.
1337434966372745217 2020-12-12 00:31:58 +0800 <Camelback71> @TrustThePlant There was no way in hell Kamala would have scored the number of suburban mommies Biden did.
1337431579564490753 2020-12-12 00:18:31 +0800 <Camelback71> They aren't cases.  They're positive tests. And God knows how many of those 36 deaths were of people who had the WuFlu but didn't die from it.
1337430433076690944 2020-12-12 00:13:58 +0800 <Camelback71> @Steigerworld I get the point.  But this red-blue county map is from 2012.   There are a lot more blue counties in 2020.
1337425574856249345 2020-12-11 23:54:39 +0800 <Camelback71> Ducey is still pushing flu shots. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1337423133234528256 2020-12-11 23:44:57 +0800 <Camelback71> It would be a lot easier for those of us who believe we are conservatives to stick to the principles of limited government and federalism if the people we vote for and elect would actually abide by them too.
1337415841743171585 2020-12-11 23:15:59 +0800 <Camelback71> @InfernalAcorn It's expensive as hell and most insurance carriers are probably balking at paying hospitals for such treatments.
1337395154232078338 2020-12-11 21:53:47 +0800 <Camelback71> This is laughable.

1337204589372686338 2020-12-11 09:16:32 +0800 <Camelback71> We certainly don't need answers to know for fact the modern day zombie left was created in woke public schools, woke college classrooms and woke media such as The New York Times, CNN and NPR.
1337203738524622848 2020-12-11 09:13:09 +0800 <Camelback71> It won't end up being 90% effective. End of story.
1337182324073455616 2020-12-11 07:48:04 +0800 <Camelback71> @NightmarEclipse @SouthernKeeks The Examiner has it's stable filled with plagiarists. The cherry on top is that Instagram stalker of teen boys Palumbo.
1337181122862534664 2020-12-11 07:43:17 +0800 <Camelback71> @NightmarEclipse @SouthernKeeks That SE Cupp knockoff blocked me long ago. Another trust fund baby college-indoctrinated lefty hired, of course, by the Examiner.
1337157920576815104 2020-12-11 06:11:06 +0800 <Camelback71> @VDAREJamesK After living in AZ for 8 years and getting a good feel for the political geography of this state, I can tell you it can be cut neatly in two by drawing a diagonal state line on State Route 60, effectively keeping south, central and west Phoenix and Tucson out of the new red state
1337150965523214337 2020-12-11 05:43:27 +0800 <Camelback71> If Republicans in the House were a serious Trump party, this woman would be relegated to a backbench and stuck in the janitors closet in the Longworth Office Building.
1337150160267141120 2020-12-11 05:40:15 +0800 <Camelback71> You can always count on Tracey to throw ignorant snark into the machine.
1337149845925027840 2020-12-11 05:39:00 +0800 <Camelback71> This is nonsense. The Texas does not allege state legislatures do not have the constitutional authority to determine the manner in which electors. It maintains the administrators in each state in question went beyond what the legislatures proscribed in conducting the election.
1337143536890724352 2020-12-11 05:13:56 +0800 <Camelback71> She's a cardboard Republican right out of central casting no matter she has a vagina.  She's got Bush Republican written all over her.
1337142840447496192 2020-12-11 05:11:10 +0800 <Camelback71> @FoxworthFor14 @chiproytx @GOP Certain issues call for virtue-signaling their principles, others, like the Indian immigrants invasion bill, call for acting on their principles.
1337138104323338241 2020-12-11 04:52:21 +0800 <Camelback71> Better do it within the next year.  You won't win any secession vote in 2024 and beyond.
1337137545662976006 2020-12-11 04:50:08 +0800 <Camelback71> @FoxworthFor14 @chiproytx @GOP In spirt I'm with you on this but keep in the mind that the real cowards here are the GOP state legislators in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin.  They have the numbers to reverse the certifications in their state and send Trump electors but do nothing.
1337136915099701249 2020-12-11 04:47:38 +0800 <Camelback71> Before one rips Roy here (and I do think he's a phony), keep in mind voters should be aiming their fire at the Republican legislators in the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin and Arizona who continue to do nothing but whisper sweet nothings on Twitter.
1337132314300542976 2020-12-11 04:29:21 +0800 <Camelback71> This is nothing but a press release for the CDC.  It's filled with strawman arguments and the discussion of RNA is a whitewash highlighted by CDC talking points.  https://t.co/cvFqZpW2As
1337117299392724993 2020-12-11 03:29:41 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist It rained today - FINALLY.  Downpours this morning.  Still overcast.  But I'm hardly a debbie-downer about that.  We needed rain.  It's been 145 days or so since our last significant true rainfall here.
1337116643000950784 2020-12-11 03:27:04 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist I have been a rather sack of coal as of late.
1337114869011628033 2020-12-11 03:20:01 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist Not so fast. I see alot of red areas here that are blue, almost blue and purple. You'll need to expel a lot of undesirables the coasts for this to work.
1337098276147920898 2020-12-11 02:14:05 +0800 <Camelback71> If we can't have helicopters, I'll gladly take proscription lists.

1337093317016752128 2020-12-11 01:54:23 +0800 <Camelback71> @dennisjsaffran To do what?  We already voted.  Calling Senate Republicans to do something about this?  You're kidding yourself.  I think you need to come to grips with the fact the system needs destroyed if the drift leftward is to be stopped.  And that only happens one of two ways.
1337092587614715906 2020-12-11 01:51:29 +0800 <Camelback71> @MotherRobinson3 My apologies.  The particular turd has been on an establishment-ass kissing Tweet-a-thon the last few days.  I have an uncontrollable Pavlovian response to such drek.
1337091380057759745 2020-12-11 01:46:41 +0800 <Camelback71> At least he moved against - half-heartedly.  If you're asking establishment Republicans to heed your call here, you're delusional. They won't lift a finger.  Tell me again why it's so important we maintain a GOP majority in the Senate again?
1337090611879374849 2020-12-11 01:43:38 +0800 <Camelback71> Who cares?
1337090368735592448 2020-12-11 01:42:40 +0800 <Camelback71> Yes @KurtSchlichter please keep telling us all we need to keep a GOP majority in the Senate.   https://t.co/C4YKp2gsDk
1337067409480372224 2020-12-11 00:11:26 +0800 <Camelback71> At the rate legal immigrants are replacing the white founding stock, there won't be many red states left to secede by 2028.
1337066206608596994 2020-12-11 00:06:39 +0800 <Camelback71> A pastor who countenances dead babies.  How Christian.
1337059242860285954 2020-12-10 23:38:59 +0800 <Camelback71> Barf.
1337058507217055750 2020-12-10 23:36:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Let's not do something because the Left will use it against us. This has been the de facto call of surrender from conservatives in media for 20 years. Is there any better evidence of them being controlled opposition?
1337026568896442370 2020-12-10 21:29:09 +0800 <Camelback71> NR really is stuck on stupid. Every Republican governor, sans DeSantis and Noem, are a disgrace and would never pass the smell test with GOP base voters.
1337025073274753024 2020-12-10 21:23:12 +0800 <Camelback71> The Republican governor, secretary of state and this ü§° are all cowards.
1336908269894262786 2020-12-10 13:39:04 +0800 <Camelback71> @demontage2000 Arizona didn't join the suit. They filed a weak, mealy-mouthed amicus brief.
1336907314205356032 2020-12-10 13:35:16 +0800 <Camelback71> Apparently he didn't learn to drive drunk off a bridge with a young woman and leave her to drown in the car.
1336848469907009539 2020-12-10 09:41:27 +0800 <Camelback71> Don't be fooled here. Arizona didn't join the case. Brnovich simply filed a pathetic amicus brief asking for quick relief. It's a phoney filing to con the rubes.
1336805957146329088 2020-12-10 06:52:31 +0800 <Camelback71> The New Constitution was given a line of cocaine during Obama.  It's about to overdose on crack if Biden becomes President.
1336795349755826178 2020-12-10 06:10:22 +0800 <Camelback71> Another moron who doesn't under how seasonsal and strain immunity actually works.  I'm sure she believe the vaccine will eradicate the virus, too.  LoL
1336795010168025093 2020-12-10 06:09:01 +0800 <Camelback71> 99.8% of them will live and they'll have immunity for a few months.  Good for them.
1336783429149491200 2020-12-10 05:23:00 +0800 <Camelback71> Why wasn't this initiated and announced BEFORE the election??
1336782260100419584 2020-12-10 05:18:21 +0800 <Camelback71> Right @TianaTheFirst...
1336782081129553921 2020-12-10 05:17:39 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos I don't want to defend the media here but the fact is Trump and his legal team have yet to score any legal victory yet. The media has an easy excuse to ignore this one. One that can't be so easily ascribed to bias (though it is) "Just another Hail Mary sure to knocked down".
1336766941688565761 2020-12-10 04:17:29 +0800 <Camelback71> Routine tests?  Why are government officials being routinely tested if they have no symptoms?
1336766528285392897 2020-12-10 04:15:50 +0800 <Camelback71> He has no symptoms?  Then why did he get tested?
1336760425577283584 2020-12-10 03:51:35 +0800 <Camelback71> What hole has the Jacobin been living in the last 40 years?
1336757684163420161 2020-12-10 03:40:42 +0800 <Camelback71> You wanted him.
1336745168527978496 2020-12-10 02:50:58 +0800 <Camelback71> "Conservative policy" equals masks, lockdowns and small business destruction?  Don't think the Republican Party needs to shrivel up and die?
1336744759516225536 2020-12-10 02:49:20 +0800 <Camelback71> Someone was drunk over at ASU.
1336743752388366337 2020-12-10 02:45:20 +0800 <Camelback71> Another Ducey sycophant.
1336739694361542660 2020-12-10 02:29:13 +0800 <Camelback71> Two of the worst Republican governors in the country.
1336737800150925312 2020-12-10 02:21:41 +0800 <Camelback71> @oblivious_guy Why, yes he did.
1336730934133968897 2020-12-10 01:54:24 +0800 <Camelback71> And?
1336730772124827651 2020-12-10 01:53:45 +0800 <Camelback71> The only thing that will help slow the spread of the 'Ro is staying home if you feel sick.  The rest is of this science fiction.
1336729312704094210 2020-12-10 01:47:58 +0800 <Camelback71> Nixon didn't lose. Like Trump, he was a victim of fraud in the states of Texas and Illinois.
1336728483980963841 2020-12-10 01:44:40 +0800 <Camelback71> We've swapped the Bush family for the Trump family?  Hard pass.
1336716853377286144 2020-12-10 00:58:27 +0800 <Camelback71> ...and 99.8% of them are still alive.
1336714061346525187 2020-12-10 00:47:21 +0800 <Camelback71> None of this science driven. Not the masks, not the social distancing, not the lockdowns, none of it. Medieval medicine is backed up by more real science than the witchdoctor edicts from governments around the world.
1336677814989275136 2020-12-09 22:23:20 +0800 <Camelback71> @MattGajtka @PaulZeise @MoonGolfClub @HunterAHomistek @ChrisMuellerPGH @JColony13 @rickdayton @CallsEmAsISeeEm @pghgolfnow @PghSportsNow That's the last club I have an issue with. 25 years ago we lived in a world without hybrids. Hitting a 2 and 3 irons are a hell of a lot tougher to hit than a hybrid.
1336665905669963776 2020-12-09 21:36:00 +0800 <Camelback71> Very persuasive case. Roberts will still rope in Kavanaugh to vote it down.
1336664089917964288 2020-12-09 21:28:47 +0800 <Camelback71> Clown show.
1336663527692533766 2020-12-09 21:26:33 +0800 <Camelback71> A "few fraudulent votes"... @TianaTheFirst
1336663265888202754 2020-12-09 21:25:31 +0800 <Camelback71> He's not joining that suit. He signed his name on the certification of Arizona election results and by default is one of counterparties.ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1336660930042552323 2020-12-09 21:16:14 +0800 <Camelback71> "few fraudulent votes"...
1336549801777754115 2020-12-09 13:54:39 +0800 <Camelback71> Yup. If they can virtue signal for a Hail Mary throw to the Supreme Court, they can demand this avenue of redress.
1336536804896296960 2020-12-09 13:03:00 +0800 <Camelback71> Thomas and Alito, no doubt. You're deluding yourself and others on the other three.
1336524942502838272 2020-12-09 12:15:52 +0800 <Camelback71> The editor of National Review is under the impression he lives in the same country he was born in.
1336524121782423553 2020-12-09 12:12:36 +0800 <Camelback71> It's not big. It's a useless piece of paper. I actually like Daniel but this is nothing more than gaslighting for his run for governor.
1336523584500469760 2020-12-09 12:10:28 +0800 <Camelback71> @NNJ_Taxman @FedPorn It's one big gaslight. They'll be a 4 day kabuki show at the Supreme Court, Robert Barnes and Ron Coleman will gaslight us all with their persuasive arguments (that should be heeded by state legislators) and in the end a 6-3 majority will rule against Texas, et al.
1336521798377066497 2020-12-09 12:03:22 +0800 <Camelback71> What Q violence are you talking about? ü•¥  https://t.co/yhjl3EOCn0

1336488666177306629 2020-12-09 09:51:43 +0800 <Camelback71> "This" what? You, your boss, and colleagues at AZDHS have destroyed hundreds of small businesses in the state with lockdowns, continue to push pseudoscience on the public (masks) and have done everything to avoid accountability.
1336487919838666754 2020-12-09 09:48:45 +0800 <Camelback71> You mean "the talented, and committed public servants" at @AZDHS who keep pushing mask use on the public, which has been wearing the damn things since late July, while cases continue to climb higher? Those idiots?

1336394111163613184 2020-12-09 03:35:59 +0800 <Camelback71> @FLA_CrackerBoy @NolteNC The final season of Hell on Wheels goes out of its way (after not doing the same for the Sioux and blacks in the first three seasons) to deliver an over the top politically correct narrative on the Chinese contribution to the building of the Central Pacific.
1336389724844347392 2020-12-09 03:18:33 +0800 <Camelback71> If you want to understand this mindset of establishment Republicans since the late 1990s, read Christopher Caldwell's The Age of Entitlement.

1336359204303474688 2020-12-09 01:17:17 +0800 <Camelback71> Dan, you're a smart guy.  You damn well the vaccine will not signal life getting back to normal.
1336358424162914306 2020-12-09 01:14:11 +0800 <Camelback71> If he were a joke, his power grab from earlier this year would have been struck down and he'd be on disciplinary probation.  He's not a joke.
1336357885836595201 2020-12-09 01:12:02 +0800 <Camelback71> SCOTUS is a super legislature at this point.  The law means nothing.  Kavanaugh will be roped in by Roberts to vote with the Communists on the Court to reject the petition.
1336357397665746946 2020-12-09 01:10:06 +0800 <Camelback71> @Shannonagain2 It's all failure theatre.  Republicans in Arizona can't even get a majority of their members to sign a worthless piece of paper contesting the election certification.  The same drill is going on in Michigan and Georgia.
1336334484904443904 2020-12-08 23:39:03 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos Bingo. He should delete that post. It's third grade-level education thinking.

1336064054339637249 2020-12-08 05:44:28 +0800 <Camelback71> Apparently 78 year old Larry thought only pneumonia and the flu were allowed to kill him.
1336016318609248258 2020-12-08 02:34:46 +0800 <Camelback71> @NNJ_Taxman @GovMurphy ...much more truthful.
1336008845227827202 2020-12-08 02:05:05 +0800 <Camelback71> Republicans had 4 years to propose a plan that would have withheld colleges and universities federal education aid dollars and diverted such monies to student loan forgiveness and required going forward college endowments be taxed to cover the shortfall on loan defaults. /end
1336008842866376705 2020-12-08 02:05:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Whether you like it or not, this will sew up the white college educated vote for Democrats for the next 20 years.  And yes, Democrats will be straddling white working class voters with the bill.  But why not?  They don't care about them anymore anyways. /1
1336002399958257666 2020-12-08 01:39:28 +0800 <Camelback71> You and your colleagues had a chance to do something about this last week with the NDAA but punted and rebuked the President.  You're all hypocrites, Senator.
1336000728171565059 2020-12-08 01:32:49 +0800 <Camelback71> Okay, this is hilarious.  And more of us should be playing this game.
1335999906461335552 2020-12-08 01:29:34 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos But the globalists in government would rather we sacrifice hundreds of thousands of American boys to save the plethora of multinationals, syndicate banks and casinos over there for the global oligarchs. /end
1335999538033659905 2020-12-08 01:28:06 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos Amen.  The simplest way to cripple the Chinese is raise tariffs through the roof, increase our trade with Taiwan, Japan and Korea, and completely isolate China economically.  1/
1335998831549280256 2020-12-08 01:25:17 +0800 <Camelback71> Mask compliance in Arizona is near 100%.  Arizonans have been wearing masks everywhere they go since July.  And cases are still going up, up, up.  How can this be?
1335998511083528198 2020-12-08 01:24:01 +0800 <Camelback71> Then why are cases going up, up, up in Arizona?  We've been masked up since July.
1335998232300679169 2020-12-08 01:22:54 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos It's not our problem.  And those up in arms over this need to ask themselves this question:  Are you willing to send American boys over there to occupy Hong Kong and start a war with the Chinese?  No?  Then stop with the virtue signalling.
1335997680300879873 2020-12-08 01:20:43 +0800 <Camelback71> Yup.
1335997571240607745 2020-12-08 01:20:17 +0800 <Camelback71> Are you f-ing kidding me?  "the challenge of our lifetime"?? The challenge of our lifetime is getting enough Arizonans to defy your tyrannical Covid decrees and throw you out of office.
1335995932102422529 2020-12-08 01:13:46 +0800 <Camelback71> @johnnyrockett01 @subiectat Good catch -- Bork, Simpson/Mazzoli bill, more Civil Rights Act additions...
1335984590226300930 2020-12-08 00:28:42 +0800 <Camelback71> @subiectat Interesting observation.  It reminds of the line from the Warren Beatty movie, "Reds".  A member of the Republican club of Portland, Oregon asks commie Jack Reed what the Great War is all about.  Expecting some patriotic mumbo jumbo, Reed spits back "Profits!"
1335983099235078147 2020-12-08 00:22:46 +0800 <Camelback71> @subiectat America post-1988 is, no doubt.  I'm willing to give America pre-1988 the benefit of the doubt.
1335982142967332864 2020-12-08 00:18:58 +0800 <Camelback71> How delusional are the Never Trumpers?  You can fit Hogan's Republican's supporters in a phone booth.

1335980262363078663 2020-12-08 00:11:30 +0800 <Camelback71> Take a hike.  We need a full signature match audit of the state's ballots.  On average 3% of mail-in ballots are rejected in our state elections. This year only 1% were and we had a 500 fold increase in the number of ballots.

1335946743423270914 2020-12-07 21:58:18 +0800 <Camelback71> Electing Loeffler and Perdue is the equivalent of an illegal procedure penalty against the Left. The Left is still on offense and has been since Reagan. The ball continues in it's inevitable destination: The Progressive end zone.
1335941462475767815 2020-12-07 21:37:19 +0800 <Camelback71> Prosecuted for what? Peacefully protesting?
1335941276500283392 2020-12-07 21:36:35 +0800 <Camelback71> LoL. I'm sure you were making the same complaints about BLM and Antifa this past year.
1335941059713531905 2020-12-07 21:35:43 +0800 <Camelback71> Peaceful protest, bro.
1335937965986443267 2020-12-07 21:23:26 +0800 <Camelback71> Screwing your own voters is now your legacy. And Rafsenberger's. There's nothing great about that.
1335935174572298241 2020-12-07 21:12:20 +0800 <Camelback71> @Skyejohnson4 Please spare us all the Prager U drek. America has had socialism since the 1930s. It's not totalitarianism communism (although we may be heading there)  but the fact is conservatives like Prager will balk at rolling back most features of America's version of socialism.
1335821271125245952 2020-12-07 13:39:44 +0800 <Camelback71> Why? The study is fraudulent. Masks don't work.
1335820901107916803 2020-12-07 13:38:15 +0800 <Camelback71> LoL. How's Germany doing now?
1335818671977984000 2020-12-07 13:29:24 +0800 <Camelback71> GA Republicans already voted in historic numbers. They still lost. Want to give it another try?
1335818448694169600 2020-12-07 13:28:31 +0800 <Camelback71> You're truly clueless. As are many other normie cons.
1335755998410100737 2020-12-07 09:20:21 +0800 <Camelback71> @VDAREJamesK ...and how much pushback do you expect from the likes Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Mike newdehLee, Dan Cringeshaw and Nikki Haley when corporate America requires Americans to take vaccine in order the participate in the economy? 'Cause that's next.
1335754307396722689 2020-12-07 09:13:38 +0800 <Camelback71> @VDAREJamesK You already have the usual GOP suspects and their normie Con boosters at Fox and on social media barfing up the nauseating "the new multi-ethnic, working class Republican Party" silliness. Of course it's just another catchy slogan to con the rubes with in addition to "Socialism!"

1335601111072313345 2020-12-06 23:04:53 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos For those scolding GOP voters for sitting this one out and letting Democrats run the show, the sad fact is the finish line remains the same - the Progressive endzone. We either get there in 4 plays under Democrats or 10 under Republicans. /End
1335600876858212355 2020-12-06 23:03:57 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos It's well past time the politicians at least face the consequences of their constant betrayal. If they do not, GOP voters have no one but themselves to blame. /3
1335600108423892993 2020-12-06 23:00:54 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos If you think about it, GOP politicians are envious of the "conservative" judges they appoint. They continually issue major opinions that GOP voters find repugnant and life-changing and yet never have to face the consequences of such betrayal. /2.
1335599190437609472 2020-12-06 22:57:15 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos So along as GOP politicians are more afraid of being called racists, homophobes, xenophobes and anti-semites, they will never adhere to what their voters actually want. /1
1335408883922132993 2020-12-06 10:21:03 +0800 <Camelback71> Please stop with the "multiracial, working class Republican Party" wishcasting. It's nauseating.
1335407888580321282 2020-12-06 10:17:05 +0800 <Camelback71> So what? The same ballots were fed into machine multiple times by multiple felons.
1335334436741627904 2020-12-06 05:25:13 +0800 <Camelback71> @oblivious_guy George Marshall was no commie but he, like Acheson, had a soft spot for them or in most cases made excuses for them.
1335334171909111809 2020-12-06 05:24:10 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, the white men who discovered the New World, developed steam engine technology, railroads, found and refined oil and other fossil fuels, harnessed electricity, created the internal combustion engine, and put a man on the moon, among other things, were mediocrities.
1335304755397054464 2020-12-06 03:27:17 +0800 <Camelback71> So you've virtue signalled three times?

1335091172990074880 2020-12-05 13:18:35 +0800 <Camelback71> Yup. The press release is filled with errors, omissions and a complete misunderstanding of the US Constitution.
1335090606301827073 2020-12-05 13:16:19 +0800 <Camelback71> This is a complete misreading of both the US Constitution and the perogatives of his own legislative body.

1334639042214817792 2020-12-04 07:21:58 +0800 <Camelback71> The voters aren't to blame.  The candidates will be.
1334585454205669376 2020-12-04 03:49:02 +0800 <Camelback71> Kurt has still said nothing about Mike Lee's visa giveaway to China and India and betrayal of American workers.
1334584144534237184 2020-12-04 03:43:50 +0800 <Camelback71> As if your boss' lockdowns and Covid tyranny has nothing to do with them?
1334573984176717824 2020-12-04 03:03:27 +0800 <Camelback71> The "we just can't do it in time" excuse from Republicans in Georgia who control both the legislative and executive branches. How many times are we going to put up with this crap?
1334555622507855875 2020-12-04 01:50:29 +0800 <Camelback71> Care to comment on you not objecting to Mike Lee's visa giveaway and betrayal of American tech workers?
1334555378026045440 2020-12-04 01:49:31 +0800 <Camelback71> So we are trusting McConnell not to pass amnesty?  Lmao.  These aren't judges, Ryan.  Go take a nap.
1334554057021612034 2020-12-04 01:44:16 +0800 <Camelback71> You seem ready to.  Who are you kidding here?

1334550222832197633 2020-12-04 01:29:02 +0800 <Camelback71> He gets half the story right. But his reliance on the "America is an idea" nonsense to explain America's resistance to multiculturalism is laughable.  https://t.co/P06NgtbA4N
1334549379319906304 2020-12-04 01:25:41 +0800 <Camelback71> ...and, unlike since 1965, how did it prevent multiculturalism, Mark?
1334548228591681536 2020-12-04 01:21:07 +0800 <Camelback71> They won't vote for amnesty? Lmao.
1334547806250434560 2020-12-04 01:19:26 +0800 <Camelback71> But some of the worst bills will still get on Biden's desk from a GOP Senate, including the nation destroying amnesty of 30 million plus illegals. Not very convincing anymore Ryan.

1334546851035377664 2020-12-04 01:15:38 +0800 <Camelback71> But Ryan here wants to be clear that you should vote to reelect him in 2024!
1334522872518197253 2020-12-03 23:40:21 +0800 <Camelback71> This is nonsense.  And a cop-out.

1334521633537548291 2020-12-03 23:35:26 +0800 <Camelback71> Has this fraud said anything about Mike Lee's anti-American visa giveaway to foreign tech workers?  Anything?
1334499119109292032 2020-12-03 22:05:58 +0800 <Camelback71> The Senate GOP sold out the country to these people yesterday. Nice try, Ron.
1334498465548652547 2020-12-03 22:03:22 +0800 <Camelback71> @RotNScoundrel We're already surrendering by voting for these Republicans who are in the Senate.
1334497553815990272 2020-12-03 21:59:45 +0800 <Camelback71> Not early 2021. Georgia needs to do this NOW.
1334491454597566464 2020-12-03 21:35:31 +0800 <Camelback71> No, that was the Senate GOP passing Mike Lee's bill yesterday.
1334490935690838020 2020-12-03 21:33:27 +0800 <Camelback71> Don't try comedy again.
1334486863407587329 2020-12-03 21:17:16 +0800 <Camelback71> Right @KurtSchlichter?
1334486255564849152 2020-12-03 21:14:51 +0800 <Camelback71> His books need to become reality.
1334485833596866562 2020-12-03 21:13:10 +0800 <Camelback71> Then we have this idiot. A coward who continues to say nothing about the Senate GOP's betrayal of American tech workers.
1334362966951518211 2020-12-03 13:04:57 +0800 <Camelback71> F him and F u.
1334362863809380352 2020-12-03 13:04:32 +0800 <Camelback71> Another establishment con man. Hewitt has said nothing about the Senate GOP's betrayal of America First today.
1334333797400072194 2020-12-03 11:09:02 +0800 <Camelback71> By voting unanimously for Sen. Lee's big tech visas giveaway bill? Lmao.
1334332844965969920 2020-12-03 11:05:15 +0800 <Camelback71> Vote Republican in Georgia because Republicans will only pi** on your grave. Democrats will pi** and sh** on it!
1334331818301030400 2020-12-03 11:01:10 +0800 <Camelback71> Why? For more H1B visa giveaways to China and India?
1334326440628604928 2020-12-03 10:39:48 +0800 <Camelback71> He finds this troubling but not the Lee bill or the NDAA passed today.
1334326090668539904 2020-12-03 10:38:25 +0800 <Camelback71> Tom Cotton's legal immigration restrictions bill was shelved within 24 hours of the Goodlatte bill failing in the House in 2018. Lee's foreign workers giveaway bill was ressurected in less than 6 months this year and passed without one GOP objection.
1334325373564112896 2020-12-03 10:35:34 +0800 <Camelback71> Have you said one word about what the Senate GOP did just today? And how does pulling that shit motivate Georgia GOP voters?
1334324941722800129 2020-12-03 10:33:51 +0800 <Camelback71> Waste.of.time.
1334324663250341888 2020-12-03 10:32:44 +0800 <Camelback71> A lot of bad things will happen. Not "may". And most will be aimed at destroying the America First agenda's continued hold on the GOP.
1334324004505546752 2020-12-03 10:30:07 +0800 <Camelback71> Your silence on what the GOP Senate did just today speaks volumes.
1334323107725602816 2020-12-03 10:26:34 +0800 <Camelback71> Giving the country away to China and India isn't cutting off your pinky finger. It's getting hung, drawn and quartered you moron.
1334321587319787520 2020-12-03 10:20:31 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao. Your full of shit. And I really don't care about foreigners. I care about Americans.
1334321222419562496 2020-12-03 10:19:04 +0800 <Camelback71> This is outright bullshit.
1334321116559650816 2020-12-03 10:18:39 +0800 <Camelback71> This is nonsense.
1334321056002129920 2020-12-03 10:18:24 +0800 <Camelback71> The Senate GOP is even bragging about this betrayal of Americans with tech degrees.
1334320479507628033 2020-12-03 10:16:07 +0800 <Camelback71> The two Georgia GOP candidates couldn't even be bothered to object to Mike Lee's big tech bill giveaway to Silicon Valley. You were saying?
1334319903591997440 2020-12-03 10:13:50 +0800 <Camelback71> Major victories? This isn't even a field goal.
1334312294570844161 2020-12-03 09:43:36 +0800 <Camelback71> They both punted.
1334311995613478912 2020-12-03 09:42:24 +0800 <Camelback71> Republicans win elections and never do anything to pass the policies they campaign on. But hey, let's keep winning elections!
1334311699759783936 2020-12-03 09:41:14 +0800 <Camelback71> Sounds like someone I know, right  @KurtSchlichter?
1334310863696613376 2020-12-03 09:37:54 +0800 <Camelback71> Comedy gold: So Georgians should vote GOP because they're only slightly worse than the Democrats?
1334309482965307392 2020-12-03 09:32:25 +0800 <Camelback71> Kurt is simply lobbying for the same  establishment GOP game that has played its voters for fools for over 30 years.
1334294354702155776 2020-12-03 08:32:18 +0800 <Camelback71> They can't even be bothered to protect American tech workers.  What makes you think a Senate GOP will do what's necessary to repair our broken voting system?
1334293035711021059 2020-12-03 08:27:04 +0800 <Camelback71> @NNJ_Taxman @ThunderB The Mike Lee open borders giveaway to Indian big tech lobbyists.
1334292860087091201 2020-12-03 08:26:22 +0800 <Camelback71> When are you going to fucking comment on this @KurtSchlichter? When?  You goddamn fraud.
1334292691467702273 2020-12-03 08:25:42 +0800 <Camelback71> This guy.  He still won't address the Mike Lee giveaway. Nothing.
1334292421740388352 2020-12-03 08:24:37 +0800 <Camelback71> Oh, he piped up!   Still nothing from this fraud on Mike Lee's open borders give away to big tech.  Nothing.
1334291923092209664 2020-12-03 08:22:39 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao.  This guy.  The Senate GOP just voted unanimously for open borders to undermine American tech workers. Clown show.
1334290851489402880 2020-12-03 08:18:23 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos @KurtSchlichter @JordanSchachtel I'm still waiting for any comment from @KurtSchlichter, @JordanSchachtel or @johncardillo.  Nothing. Silence.  The fact is they don't care about the legal immigration issue at all. All three is still caught up in the Buckley fusionism nonsense.
1334290409321713664 2020-12-03 08:16:38 +0800 <Camelback71> So what if he is?  Mike Lee isn't.  Care to comment?  Or are you just a Covid one trick pony?  https://t.co/ZzdFdLzKSZ
1334290228777873409 2020-12-03 08:15:55 +0800 <Camelback71> @NNJ_Taxman @ThunderB Today has been a hell of a clarification day for the "Vote GOP in Georgia" fanboys.
1334289985768308738 2020-12-03 08:14:57 +0800 <Camelback71> Still waiting @johncardillo...
1334289750178455552 2020-12-03 08:14:01 +0800 <Camelback71> @BringBackPapa True.  But did she object to the Mike Lee bill today?  I think you know your answer.
1334289498335633410 2020-12-03 08:13:00 +0800 <Camelback71> The Senate GOP just voted for open borders and this is what this useless fuck whines about.
1334289204642074624 2020-12-03 08:11:50 +0800 <Camelback71> You retweeted this @MarkSKrikorian but earlier you were scolding conservatives for questioning the use of a Senate GOP majority.  Care to comment?
1334288857685082113 2020-12-03 08:10:28 +0800 <Camelback71> Still haven't heard boo from @KurtSchlichter or @JordanSchachtel on this?
1334288077003444225 2020-12-03 08:07:22 +0800 <Camelback71> It's not a good day for the @KurtSchlichter and @JordanSchachtel crowd of pom pom waving, Cocaine Mitch fanboys.
1334283652360884228 2020-12-03 07:49:47 +0800 <Camelback71> Masks are working to make cases spike in the state.
1334279406982848512 2020-12-03 07:32:54 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya @KurtSchlichter this GOP Senate majority is so worth it. Care to comment @JordanSchachtel?
1334268659695435776 2020-12-03 06:50:12 +0800 <Camelback71> Speaking of grifters, @JordanSchachtel.
1334268393118027779 2020-12-03 06:49:09 +0800 <Camelback71> Who wants to bet Ducey caves?
1334267641238732800 2020-12-03 06:46:09 +0800 <Camelback71> Keep in mind that Jordan here has no problem with visa giveaways, amnesty or any immigration disaster legislation that will be endorsed by some Gang of 8.
1334264652297953280 2020-12-03 06:34:17 +0800 <Camelback71> Yes @johncardillo the GOP really needs to the keep the Senate. Lmao.
1334264201754206208 2020-12-03 06:32:29 +0800 <Camelback71> @BringBackPapa Ernst? Lmao. Nice try though.
1334260908743294976 2020-12-03 06:19:24 +0800 <Camelback71> Name six reliable Republican Senators, John. Name them.
1334260543457124353 2020-12-03 06:17:57 +0800 <Camelback71> Julie understands the score. It's too bad the GOP grifting class doesn't.
1334260074076721153 2020-12-03 06:16:05 +0800 <Camelback71> @MarkSKrikorian @BigJebBos Really? How do you know at this point?
1334259913476853761 2020-12-03 06:15:27 +0800 <Camelback71> So what?
1334259639106461696 2020-12-03 06:14:21 +0800 <Camelback71> A GOP Senate is poised to endorse amnesty, John. This argument falls flat.
1334257592722317313 2020-12-03 06:06:14 +0800 <Camelback71> Good grief.
1334211196019380224 2020-12-03 03:01:52 +0800 <Camelback71> It appears the phony conservatives over at the Examiner, including the plagiarist @TianaTheFirst, are out to once again slime some of the actual conservatives/populists that won election to the House this year.
1334209043875856384 2020-12-03 02:53:19 +0800 <Camelback71> Tell me again why the Georgia Senate seats matter again?
1334208234811375616 2020-12-03 02:50:06 +0800 <Camelback71> @oblivious_guy @FoxworthFor14 At this rate, Texas would vote to stay in blue America.  I'm becoming more resigned to the fact there will be no secession at all.
1334203930620772352 2020-12-03 02:33:00 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried Gay acceptance and/or tolerance is mainstream. The gay rights agenda is not "mainstream".  And if you ask a random a base GOP voter in private about gay marriage most would accept it but think it absurd.
1334201096701526016 2020-12-03 02:21:44 +0800 <Camelback71> Cotto and those in the FL-GOP leadership positions see it as being mainstream, not the most FL-GOP voters.
1334200596988010497 2020-12-03 02:19:45 +0800 <Camelback71> So GOP voters aren't the problem.  The leadership is.  Got it.
1334193078266019841 2020-12-03 01:49:52 +0800 <Camelback71> @sokicamz Useless.
1334192739311788032 2020-12-03 01:48:31 +0800 <Camelback71> This is more nonsense. Republicans have courted the traditional Right for over 30 years, elected pandering Republicans only to have them pass tax cuts and do nothing about the culture. Try to get the history right here.
1334192114301763584 2020-12-03 01:46:02 +0800 <Camelback71> Politics is about power, getting it and USING it. Principled conservatives are sick of electing Republicans and them not using it. Big difference.
1334184352381423623 2020-12-03 01:15:12 +0800 <Camelback71> The helicopter option is gaining ground.
1334183513138991104 2020-12-03 01:11:52 +0800 <Camelback71> @frankieboy1 @Mark_E_Noonan @CottoGottfried That's not an example. It's an anecdote.
1334183373812600833 2020-12-03 01:11:18 +0800 <Camelback71> @Mark_E_Noonan @CottoGottfried I have no doubt that this is case. But it's not a very high percentage of the gay population. Cotto's views on the Florida GOP are all conjecture at best, bullshit at worse.
1334181659571220480 2020-12-03 01:04:30 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried Under your "large enough big tent to drive a whale through" GOP it won't be long till all of that goes away. It's becoming quite clear you're no better than the boomer libertarians that dominated the Reagan era. An era which sewed the seeds of where we are today.
1334179473860685826 2020-12-03 00:55:49 +0800 <Camelback71> This is nonsense. And the gays in the Keys aren't surrounded by straight San Francisco Stalinists.
1334175503066886144 2020-12-03 00:40:02 +0800 <Camelback71> @MarkDavis A terrible Senator.  And no conservative.
1334175042209345536 2020-12-03 00:38:12 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried Could care less if they are "already here".  The GOP simply needs to stop pushing and endorsing the gay agenda.
1334174699513802754 2020-12-03 00:36:50 +0800 <Camelback71> Tim wants to arrest people for thinking we need to upend a system that holds and condones fraudulent elections.
1334167847170232321 2020-12-03 00:09:37 +0800 <Camelback71> No.  The FL-GOP model works because of its particular demographics.  It won't work in other states.
1334164588019945473 2020-12-02 23:56:40 +0800 <Camelback71> ...which is why the Georgia Senate races don't matter at ALL.
1334164275087085570 2020-12-02 23:55:25 +0800 <Camelback71> The "real gift of Christmas" is our health??  And all this time I thought it was the birth of Messiah?
1334163721539620865 2020-12-02 23:53:13 +0800 <Camelback71> Yes, because shutdowns have worked so well in Illinois and New Jersey so far.
1334159787597066241 2020-12-02 23:37:35 +0800 <Camelback71> To begin with, the most accurate depiction of Jesus' beliefs is not found in one sermon. The sermon itself mentions nothing about the Heart of the Law, the first Great Commandment, only expounds upon the second.
1334141103247740930 2020-12-02 22:23:20 +0800 <Camelback71> The ugly truth.
1334135075538051077 2020-12-02 21:59:23 +0800 <Camelback71> There are reports that six Republican Senators are already looking to make a "immigration reform" deal (read: amnesty, more H1B visas, et al.) and somehow we're supposed to think Georgia is going to matter?
1334133821550120961 2020-12-02 21:54:24 +0800 <Camelback71> Half the country wants to see this Charlie.
1334116393936056322 2020-12-02 20:45:09 +0800 <Camelback71> What, and be accused of killing everyone's grandparents?
1334054405180596225 2020-12-02 16:38:50 +0800 <Camelback71> @musicmankev ...and Twitter will become a shell of itself.
1334007152193638401 2020-12-02 13:31:04 +0800 <Camelback71> @musicmankev Indeed. And open up Twitter and Facebook to lawsuits which is a glorious thing. Exposing their hypocrisy and damaging their influence can only be a good thing.
1333985576064729089 2020-12-02 12:05:20 +0800 <Camelback71> God forbid we hold up military funding for the sacred right of free speech.
1333985109112803328 2020-12-02 12:03:28 +0800 <Camelback71> And? You lie on here all the time.
1333951425248849920 2020-12-02 09:49:38 +0800 <Camelback71> 10 years? Try 4. Houston will be the new Detroit by then.
1333937943711367171 2020-12-02 08:56:03 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos @JimDelRey How did you find this cockroach?
1333925791906766848 2020-12-02 08:07:46 +0800 <Camelback71> @zones2surf @NightmarEclipse Reagan as it turned out wasn't even "Reagan".  Those he populated his administration with were the other side of the boomer coin:  Libertarians. The actual outcome of his Presidency reflects that. It's Ayn Rand that has animated elected Republicans since 1980, not Calvin Coolidge
1333924587176820737 2020-12-02 08:02:59 +0800 <Camelback71> America in 2020 is more 1640 France than 1640 England.  I'm beginning to think, though, that American in 2024 may not be far from 1789 France no matter that the Jacobins don't have the guns.
1333923605424402432 2020-12-02 07:59:05 +0800 <Camelback71> @NightmarEclipse I can't say this loud enough, if you want to know why we are where we are today in 2020, you have to read Christopher Caldwell's The Age of Entitlement.  It's discussion of the history and intersection of the two Americas now fully out of the closet is masterful.
1333922257094152195 2020-12-02 07:53:43 +0800 <Camelback71> @NightmarEclipse Some on the Right have seen it for what it was since the turn of the century.  Quite a few of us are only making sense of since Trump's election.  From 1980 and 2000, GOP voters have been blinded to the agenda of those they have elected whether they be at state Capitols or in DC.
1333901636478013440 2020-12-02 06:31:47 +0800 <Camelback71> Robin Williams isn't dead?
1333857210942640130 2020-12-02 03:35:15 +0800 <Camelback71> Then why do you and your GOP colleagues keep funding them with tax cuts and supplying them with that cheap foreign labor?
1333856762483490817 2020-12-02 03:33:28 +0800 <Camelback71> @rightwingnutrs @Blair_A_Nathan Funny how assimilation and inter-marriage actually, you know, works in a West's modern nation state when the world around you isn't flooded by foreigners.
1333855759126327300 2020-12-02 03:29:29 +0800 <Camelback71> Yes.  Yes he did.
1333854825927217152 2020-12-02 03:25:46 +0800 <Camelback71> You can have that broad "conversation" in a bathroom stall at the local Motel 6 with Goldberg, French and Hayes you war-mongering fraud.
1333854021870764032 2020-12-02 03:22:35 +0800 <Camelback71> On his way out the door, Barr is pulling a Pontius Pilate.
1333842592602046466 2020-12-02 02:37:10 +0800 <Camelback71> You'd be more convincing passing yourself as a psychiatrist.
1333841919747649536 2020-12-02 02:34:29 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos Covid and the election has seen to that. Before Covid, most Arizona GOP voters paid Gov. Ducey no mind. He was a milquetoast politician who was plotting his next pay off. Now, every GOP voter in the State outside the McCain fanboys (and they do exist), hates his guts.
1333839529908658177 2020-12-02 02:25:00 +0800 <Camelback71> @magicalmomU7 Great pic.  I love the brown-gray hue.
1333839236810764289 2020-12-02 02:23:50 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist @ChefGruel That might be the only reason to come out and vote for the corporate stooges running for the Senate in GA.  "Muh judges" ain't going to cut it anymore.
1333836166559277056 2020-12-02 02:11:38 +0800 <Camelback71> Ellen Page comes out as mentally ill.  There, fixed it for you @nypost.
1333834697483247618 2020-12-02 02:05:47 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos It computes monetarily when you realize how their wallets are kept nice and fat.  Lefty boomer and early Gen X politicians got into politics to amass power; Righty boomer and early Gen X politicians got into to score a lobbyist gig and beachside property.
1333833356123926530 2020-12-02 02:00:28 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist @ChefGruel I'll take the word of a guy who saved me from selling out of my IRA than a Chef -- no matter how good he is at food.
1333780795786285057 2020-12-01 22:31:36 +0800 <Camelback71> This is outright bullshit.
1333769114683273217 2020-12-01 21:45:11 +0800 <Camelback71> @NNJ_Taxman His Twitter account was on vacation for nearly seven days after election day. Now he's tweeting up a storm. He really does think GOP voters are dumb rubes.
1333768204905107457 2020-12-01 21:41:34 +0800 <Camelback71> Cover to cover?? Lmao.
1333767272691757056 2020-12-01 21:37:52 +0800 <Camelback71> You mean the same Jesus that nearly caused a riot outside the Temple of Jerusalem? The same Jesus that days later castigated the Pharisees in the vilest of terms?
1333762735184625665 2020-12-01 21:19:50 +0800 <Camelback71> Leftists love Ducey now.
1333761663359614982 2020-12-01 21:15:35 +0800 <Camelback71> Playing the "judges" card isn't going to work this time.
1333659131958333441 2020-12-01 14:28:09 +0800 <Camelback71> For any of this to happen, Republicans need to reconvene in open session. Don't expect Finchem to do any heavy lifting to make that happen. This smells like actionless virtue signalling.
1333654423772356609 2020-12-01 14:09:27 +0800 <Camelback71> @jpittsaz Is Ducey paying you for being his laughable stooge?
1333653903821348865 2020-12-01 14:07:23 +0800 <Camelback71> If today's hearings were any indication, you're full of shit.
1333606951477944321 2020-12-01 11:00:49 +0800 <Camelback71> Of course.
1333606730333229056 2020-12-01 10:59:56 +0800 <Camelback71> Masks work to annoy me.
1333606618127159296 2020-12-01 10:59:29 +0800 <Camelback71> They don't work. LoL
1333599507406225414 2020-12-01 10:31:14 +0800 <Camelback71> How many illegal aliens do you think live in Arizona? ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1333599212295004160 2020-12-01 10:30:03 +0800 <Camelback71> Memo to @elviadiaz1: There are at least 30 million plus illegal aliens in the US in 2020. It isn't a stretch to think at least 4 to 5 million of them live in this border state.
1333574973361819648 2020-12-01 08:53:44 +0800 <Camelback71> Looks like you won't be able to do anything after 8 pm in Tucson. The mayor wants to slap an 8 pm curfew on you.
1333574384666116096 2020-12-01 08:51:24 +0800 <Camelback71> She's shutting down restaurants and other nighttime businesses, most likely putting many out of business for good, in order to suck more tax dollars from DC. This isn't about health or any hospital surge.
1333572457429491715 2020-12-01 08:43:45 +0800 <Camelback71> It wasn't an audit.
1333572122573119488 2020-12-01 08:42:25 +0800 <Camelback71> What "conservative" not named Goldberg, Hayes, French and a few useless writers over at NR reads this crap?
1333552776949899264 2020-12-01 07:25:32 +0800 <Camelback71> "false voter fraud claims"
1333548699385950213 2020-12-01 07:09:20 +0800 <Camelback71> It would have to be a new state Attorney General. The current Republican holding that office put his signature on the certification papers too.
1333511491824205824 2020-12-01 04:41:29 +0800 <Camelback71> Maybe the most disgusting item McDonald's has ever made and sold.
1333510835218436096 2020-12-01 04:38:53 +0800 <Camelback71> This is not a parody account on Twitter.
1333510213270339584 2020-12-01 04:36:24 +0800 <Camelback71> When will they have to deal with these people "adversarially"?? When they don't go far left enough?
1333505343964413952 2020-12-01 04:17:03 +0800 <Camelback71> You belong to a heretical sect not the Catholic Church as founded by St. Peter.
1333504394118062084 2020-12-01 04:13:17 +0800 <Camelback71> @RhoadsCannon Dude, he authored a culture upending substantive due process endorsing transgender rights. Any other conservative decisions will never be so wide reaching as that. Wake the f up!
1333502113431711745 2020-12-01 04:04:13 +0800 <Camelback71> Have you read Gorsuch's majority opinion granting tranny rights?  Or did you miss that?
1333499466310008832 2020-12-01 03:53:42 +0800 <Camelback71> This guy is such garbage.
1333480032694530048 2020-12-01 02:36:29 +0800 <Camelback71> @Barnes_Law If you're counting on Arizona's Republican legislators to send their own slate of electors, think again.  They couldn't even bother to reconvene in session to challenge Doug Ducey's tyrannical Covid restrictions and business shutdowns.
1333478243622535168 2020-12-01 02:29:22 +0800 <Camelback71> Traitors, all.
1333477949417263105 2020-12-01 02:28:12 +0800 <Camelback71> Pretty good summation of what National Review has devolved into over the past 20 years.
1333476656636256256 2020-12-01 02:23:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, f*** off.
1333475972369108993 2020-12-01 02:20:21 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, this nonsense might hold water if these Federalist Society judges Trump appointed haven't turned out to be lefty judges every bit as activist as any a Democrat would appoint.  And quite frankly, at this point I want judges who aren't fair arbiters.  I want political partisans
1333421695198142468 2020-11-30 22:44:40 +0800 <Camelback71> For a virus with a survivability rate of 99.5%?
1333419979488706560 2020-11-30 22:37:51 +0800 <Camelback71> MeDIcal sCIEncE.
1333403502744281089 2020-11-30 21:32:23 +0800 <Camelback71> @RhoadsCannon Most of these Federalist Society judges are Ginsburgs. Try to keep up and stop being an ostrich.
1333403201190522883 2020-11-30 21:31:11 +0800 <Camelback71> Try reading the Danish study on SURGICAL mask use. That's how ineffective they are. And you think cloth masks are some magic talisman?? Lmao
1333402149791821827 2020-11-30 21:27:00 +0800 <Camelback71> ...and you give signal boost on your radio show to this 90% of the news media to spread their propaganda.
1333401674363224064 2020-11-30 21:25:07 +0800 <Camelback71> Positive tests aren't cases.
1333312484510294017 2020-11-30 15:30:42 +0800 <Camelback71> @phwarner Most are recommending it. But they have no scientific basis for it. It's all political at this point. Pseudoscience.
1333310874635837440 2020-11-30 15:24:18 +0800 <Camelback71> @NNJ_Taxman Oh God. Not this fucking gnome.
1333310708541362176 2020-11-30 15:23:39 +0800 <Camelback71> The courts? The Supremes? Are you delusional? Gorsuch wrote transgender rights into the Constitution. Trump judges have already issued leftist opinions. Kavanaugh is slowly becoming another John Roberts. Start paying attention.
1333309026675789828 2020-11-30 15:16:58 +0800 <Camelback71> @RhoadsCannon Most of what Trump accomplished he did with a phone and pen. And just his presence in the White House changed alot. Republicans in Washington did nothing but give tax cuts to oligarchs. To think they're now some bulwark against Trump's accomplishments is asanine.
1333304246515556352 2020-11-30 14:57:58 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao.
1333304106467819520 2020-11-30 14:57:25 +0800 <Camelback71> Who cares at this point, Mickey? If Trump loses it's over. Period. Stop being delusional.
1333303681119264769 2020-11-30 14:55:43 +0800 <Camelback71> @RhoadsCannon What is "everything"? Mitch's judges are all liberals and most of Biden's agenda items will be done with a phone and a pen.
1333303148283387904 2020-11-30 14:53:36 +0800 <Camelback71> There isn't any evidence they work. Most of the "evidence" is cherry-picked data and laughable non-peer reviewed studies featured on the CDC website.
1333302681343979520 2020-11-30 14:51:45 +0800 <Camelback71> @phwarner How bout you go read the Danish masks study? It's the most comprehensive study on masks. There are no serious epidemiologists recommending masks. Most of the scientific community has been been exposed as political hacks at this point.
1333302007835160576 2020-11-30 14:49:04 +0800 <Camelback71> @RobDye1960 ...because surgical masks and N95 masks are the same as cloth masks? How dumb are you?
1333301767124119552 2020-11-30 14:48:07 +0800 <Camelback71> @RhoadsCannon The Senate is a waste of time. They're both just swamp creatures and if we've learned anything a Republican Senate is useless.
1333301451527864320 2020-11-30 14:46:52 +0800 <Camelback71> The "his brain wasn't fully developed" defense doesn't cut it, Kim.
1333299720890904576 2020-11-30 14:39:59 +0800 <Camelback71> I'd like to meet the idiots who don't use a ladder to put Christmas decorations.
1333299015115362306 2020-11-30 14:37:11 +0800 <Camelback71> You're delusional. Kemp and his sidekick Rafsenberger are both politically dead. The sooner they go the better.
1333298105249263616 2020-11-30 14:33:34 +0800 <Camelback71> Featuring a column by S.E. Cupp about the swamp?? Lmao.
1333297784397578240 2020-11-30 14:32:17 +0800 <Camelback71> Why do Republicans have to "occupy" a legislative body they already have the majority in? ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1333297378489638913 2020-11-30 14:30:41 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, he doesn't have an agenda.
1333219647764656129 2020-11-30 09:21:48 +0800 <Camelback71> The best thing the Steelers can do Tuesday night is throw the Ravens out of the playoffs completely.
1333218232862351362 2020-11-30 09:16:11 +0800 <Camelback71> Don't give your money to these people.
1333112332780666881 2020-11-30 02:15:22 +0800 <Camelback71> For crying out loud the virus has an IFR of .5%.  The flu is .1%  We need to stop scaring people with the "suffering and DEATH" nonsense.
1333111993574703109 2020-11-30 02:14:01 +0800 <Camelback71> There aren't any "strategies" that will work.  The virus is going to virus.  And this virus has a survivability rate of 99.5%.  We need to reverse course on all of this big brother pseudo-science totalitarianism.
1333079543507083267 2020-11-30 00:05:05 +0800 <Camelback71> Masks won't stop the virus. And all the other mitigation efforts are pointless except in those areas where the most vulnerable can be found. Sweden has had the right approach since day 1 in Europe.
1333066821625266179 2020-11-29 23:14:32 +0800 <Camelback71> If they work "sometimes" according to your logic we'd be doing a better job of stopping the spread and yet they don't.
1333066270304976897 2020-11-29 23:12:20 +0800 <Camelback71> So masks don't work to stop the spread but you're chances of survival from a virus with a survival rate at 99.5% already goes up to 99.9%! ü•¥
1333059833352781824 2020-11-29 22:46:45 +0800 <Camelback71> Scott Atlas favored keeping the schools open since May.
1333058935499096064 2020-11-29 22:43:11 +0800 <Camelback71> @blanarovich It's a gag inducing. I had no idea there are so many latter-day Stalinists living in my country.
1333058208420618241 2020-11-29 22:40:18 +0800 <Camelback71> The Stalinists really love Covid.
1333058030028554243 2020-11-29 22:39:36 +0800 <Camelback71> So much for supporting small businesses.
1333057830337691648 2020-11-29 22:38:48 +0800 <Camelback71> The virus has a survival rate of 99.5%.
1333057685789413376 2020-11-29 22:38:13 +0800 <Camelback71> Good. It's time to tell Doug Ducey to go to hell.
1333057292799938560 2020-11-29 22:36:40 +0800 <Camelback71> GA GOP: Please vote for our candidate even though we think you're terrorists.
1333055799543795719 2020-11-29 22:30:44 +0800 <Camelback71> You should be next. Along with Governor Ducey. This administration's Covid tyranny must end.
1333013650144063489 2020-11-29 19:43:15 +0800 <Camelback71> @steph93065 ...which is why the Senate remaining in GOP is useless.
1333013312011788288 2020-11-29 19:41:54 +0800 <Camelback71> George Soros paid for and got what he wanted. Politics and the law in America are all about power now. Rules, laws, constitutions, and rights are irrelevant.
1333011317494407168 2020-11-29 19:33:58 +0800 <Camelback71> This üëá
1332891035425406977 2020-11-29 11:36:01 +0800 <Camelback71> Can't say enough good things about this book. And I'm only 3 chapters into it. @BigJebBos @IvoryJingoist @blanarovich @HeritageAmeric6  https://t.co/wCcMjsifGM
1332890417868673027 2020-11-29 11:33:34 +0800 <Camelback71> Highly doubt it. Kavanaugh will either join with Roberts and leftist locksteppers or Barrett will recuse herself. It's pathetic but that's probably where this is going.
1332888778814341120 2020-11-29 11:27:03 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao.
1332864591576014850 2020-11-29 09:50:56 +0800 <Camelback71> This brilliant. Brilliant!
1332862937350868994 2020-11-29 09:44:22 +0800 <Camelback71> Prediction: Kavanaugh will join Roberts and the three leftist stooges or Barrett will recuse herself and have a 4-4 outcome to uphold this awful ruling.
1332847341917749248 2020-11-29 08:42:24 +0800 <Camelback71> @tastytradeninja @WPXIAaronMartin @RonColeman Yup.
1332847165371162624 2020-11-29 08:41:41 +0800 <Camelback71> What a nonsensical decision. If the suit were filed in a timely manner, these hack justices would have claimed there was no injurious action which precipitated the filing and thrown it out in September. Heads you lose, tails you lose.
1332846000008962048 2020-11-29 08:37:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Derp.
1332845527394750465 2020-11-29 08:35:11 +0800 <Camelback71> @blanarovich Let's grant for a moment the model is right and a "health catastrophe" is looming. Should not Ducey and the state legislature have passed an emergency Covid bill to fund the hospitals for this "health catastrophe"? That's what the catastrophe is, right? They had all of November.
1332770192779317248 2020-11-29 03:35:50 +0800 <Camelback71> Viruses work. Masks don't.
1332703181697007617 2020-11-28 23:09:33 +0800 <Camelback71> @ScottMcConnell9 He may have never wanted to invade Iraq but when we got there he was all for unending nation building. Sure, he was sane. Lmao.
1332702485648052225 2020-11-28 23:06:47 +0800 <Camelback71> Trump should never concede.
1332702112053035011 2020-11-28 23:05:18 +0800 <Camelback71> I love how establishment scribes, even those right-of-center, still want to believe some unknown minority four star isn't also bought off by one or two defense contractors.
1332673779110088711 2020-11-28 21:12:43 +0800 <Camelback71> It's high time Republicans stop giving tax cuts and other economic benefits to the rich and upper middle class.
1332560546646790144 2020-11-28 13:42:46 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao. We can't even get the Republican legislature right now to endorse full fledged hearings on the election or get them to reign in Doug Ducey's Covid tyranny. @DemandDanielAZ
1332559860198567936 2020-11-28 13:40:03 +0800 <Camelback71> Biden cheated.
1332558296817909761 2020-11-28 13:33:50 +0800 <Camelback71> Not a chance. I'd disassociate myself from that channel if I was you.
1332557388591710217 2020-11-28 13:30:13 +0800 <Camelback71> No words.
1332543055874834432 2020-11-28 12:33:16 +0800 <Camelback71> Apparently, according to you Arizona was doing all of these things in September and October, now it's not. Lmao.
1332542248743886848 2020-11-28 12:30:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Good grief. The virus has a survivability rate of 99.5%.
1332542058259595264 2020-11-28 12:29:18 +0800 <Camelback71> Simply absurd. Arizona isn't any less "masked up" than it was a six weeks ago. Masks are simply pointless. The virus is going to virus.
1332541621728989184 2020-11-28 12:27:34 +0800 <Camelback71> This is nonsense. No business has gotten lax on SD and gyms are all mashed up. The fact is masks don't work and social distancing certainly isn't stopping the spread. It's a virus. And these mitigation efforts are pointless.
1332496309014515714 2020-11-28 09:27:31 +0800 <Camelback71> To sum up Will's lawyer speak: This opinion is nothing more than a green light for big city Democrat machines to cheat, and cheat and cheat and you know what I agree with it.
1332464303908089856 2020-11-28 07:20:20 +0800 <Camelback71> Federalist Society is one of the biggest frauds of the American legal profession. Trump adhered to appointing these people and they're nothing more than leftists.
1332463748854861825 2020-11-28 07:18:08 +0800 <Camelback71> So much for Mitch and his fucking judges. A Senate majority at this point doesn't matter.
1332388336829284352 2020-11-28 02:18:28 +0800 <Camelback71> That's assuming that the vax doesn't have major side effects that effects a substantial part of the population.

1332143837024686081 2020-11-27 10:06:55 +0800 <Camelback71> We do it with the flu every year of our lives. And the flu kills a much larger cross section of the population than the 'rona.

1332005457032986626 2020-11-27 00:57:03 +0800 <Camelback71> A few weeks ago we had four radical Marxists and a turncoat on the Court. I'll take the five religious zealots six days a week and definitely twice on Sunday.

1331718692153946113 2020-11-26 05:57:33 +0800 <Camelback71> Fox simply doesn't care about it's ratings. It's more ecstatic it doesn't have to advertise My Pillow.
1331718076404953088 2020-11-26 05:55:06 +0800 <Camelback71> @JoeDanaReports Dear Karen, it should change our general response to it. We don't act this way about the flu. And we shouldn't be engaged in this nonsense now. Families should celebrate this great holiday like they always have. The more the merrier.
1331710610585784320 2020-11-26 05:25:26 +0800 <Camelback71> Shut up.  And tell the hospital nurse to shut up.  The survival rate from this virus is well over 99%.
1331699384946331650 2020-11-26 04:40:49 +0800 <Camelback71> A parody but not really a parody.

1331698753774841856 2020-11-26 04:38:19 +0800 <Camelback71> The Democrat mayor of Denver doesn't seem to think its important.
1331698538623819776 2020-11-26 04:37:28 +0800 <Camelback71> @ThunderB White establishment Democrats that hold the reigns of power in the party thrive and survive on this kind of intra-party racial strife.  It's the lifeblood of the 21st century party plantation.

1331697006369140737 2020-11-26 04:31:22 +0800 <Camelback71> Probable cause for a case of fraud is now "baseless conspiracies" according to the Left.
1331696816404922368 2020-11-26 04:30:37 +0800 <Camelback71> @RonColeman The Left's standard is proof.  The court's standard should "probable cause" -- and I heard plenty of that today.
1331696574846574593 2020-11-26 04:29:39 +0800 <Camelback71> @parkercassidy4 You're not going to hear any "hard evidence" or proof. The only thing the Trump lawyers can bring forward is evidence of probable cause that fraud may have been committed. And if you haven't seen enough of that, I don't know what to tell you.  https://t.co/vuSKa58bmb
1331695340785897475 2020-11-26 04:24:45 +0800 <Camelback71> Why do you even care?  It's over, right?
1331676492003045377 2020-11-26 03:09:51 +0800 <Camelback71> @oblivious_guy Assimilation only works one way for leftists. The white Americans who created the holiday were racists. So the food must be awful.
1331669487074963457 2020-11-26 02:42:01 +0800 <Camelback71> Then she better be prosecuted for perjury. Guess what: She won't be.
1331668102942060544 2020-11-26 02:36:31 +0800 <Camelback71> When this d-bag has got his panties in a bunch you know the GOP is over the target.
1331667281168920577 2020-11-26 02:33:15 +0800 <Camelback71> John is trying to put lipstick on a pig here. It's pathetic. He damn well knows the Presidential election was not on the up-and-up in Philly.
1331653402535677952 2020-11-26 01:38:06 +0800 <Camelback71> None of this going away with a vaccine.  None of it.  The only way this ends is through mass civil disobedience.
1331652612525936640 2020-11-26 01:34:58 +0800 <Camelback71> This was like watching a hostage tape.
1331651964808019970 2020-11-26 01:32:23 +0800 <Camelback71> You knew this mail-in ballot disaster was going to happen and you did nothing.  You need to be sent packing soon.
1331650321223884800 2020-11-26 01:25:52 +0800 <Camelback71> Cotton's putting up kabuki theatre here.  Even if the GOP holds the Senate after January 5, they'll confirm Mayorkas.
1331648933529939968 2020-11-26 01:20:21 +0800 <Camelback71> I have to wonder what Doug Ducey thinks of his future in Arizona.  Does he really think he can sucker GOP voters in the state to send him to the Senate in 2022?
1331628803299282950 2020-11-26 00:00:21 +0800 <Camelback71> Why again should Georgia Republicans bother with the January run-off?  Biden doesn't need the Senate to do any of this.  And if Biden follows through, a Republican will never win the Presidency again. Period.
1331589977751265282 2020-11-25 21:26:05 +0800 <Camelback71> No. They don't work.
1331473417577537537 2020-11-25 13:42:54 +0800 <Camelback71> You get what you vote for. LA voted these people in. No one outside of SoCal should feel for anyone living there or any business operating there.
1331472486324551685 2020-11-25 13:39:12 +0800 <Camelback71> It doesn't matter. And continuing to playing this charade simply empowers the Kemps and Rafsenbergers of the Republican Party in other states and DC.
1331457100074008576 2020-11-25 12:38:04 +0800 <Camelback71> This is 100% bullshit.
1331427707603730434 2020-11-25 10:41:16 +0800 <Camelback71> F off ...
1331427187249987584 2020-11-25 10:39:12 +0800 <Camelback71> Hugh left the conversation after Justin dropped this bomb.
1331427021482729472 2020-11-25 10:38:33 +0800 <Camelback71> It has no precedent and because of that people should be wary about taking it.
1331423269321203712 2020-11-25 10:23:38 +0800 <Camelback71> @ThatParentP4P ...but, but, but the hardware and software can't be manipulated!
1331422028331589633 2020-11-25 10:18:42 +0800 <Camelback71> They're both hypocrites, Sal.
1331421044091994113 2020-11-25 10:14:48 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao.
1331420945160884225 2020-11-25 10:14:24 +0800 <Camelback71> More softballs for this clown.
1331420557573701634 2020-11-25 10:12:52 +0800 <Camelback71> If you thought the establishment GOP was a DC was worthless bag of manure, check out the Arizona establishment GOP.
1331410284527853568 2020-11-25 09:32:02 +0800 <Camelback71> I just lost another hundred brain cells reading this quote.
1331380453190733825 2020-11-25 07:33:30 +0800 <Camelback71> I'm sure @tedcruz and @HawleyMO will be gaslighting us all about this even though neither did absolutely anything from 2017-2020 to stop big tech from censoring conservatives throughout election campaign.
1331377936851558401 2020-11-25 07:23:30 +0800 <Camelback71> This is laughable.  Moderate, radical, it doesn't matter.  Each and every jurist that Biden nominates and McConnell's Senate consents to will be a lock step vote for the next big thing on the left's agenda.
1331377288240250881 2020-11-25 07:20:55 +0800 <Camelback71> We can either rush the destruction of America or slow roll it by having a slim Republican Senate majority.  In the end, we end up at the same destination.
1331370579836825600 2020-11-25 06:54:16 +0800 <Camelback71> It's going nowhere.
1331370291285479424 2020-11-25 06:53:07 +0800 <Camelback71> And in the end none of these Republican-held legislatures will do a damn thing to even order an signature match audit of the state's election results. PA Republicans won't even join a lawsuit to have the post-Nov 3 ballots thrown out.
1331368874344734721 2020-11-25 06:47:29 +0800 <Camelback71> Get ready for four years of this vomit-inducing ass smooching.

1331334152596058112 2020-11-25 04:29:31 +0800 <Camelback71> It's only going to be available to health care workers at that point.  The general population won't get it till January -- and that's only after we get feedback on any side effects suffered by the doctors and nurses.
1331333435072266241 2020-11-25 04:26:40 +0800 <Camelback71> @BobBurnatt Good grief.
1331333359507685377 2020-11-25 04:26:22 +0800 <Camelback71> Those business leaders are suckers if they think the vaccine is going to save them from Doug Ducey's tyranny.
1331333045522108417 2020-11-25 04:25:07 +0800 <Camelback71> Cloth masks don't work and are useless.  And businesses haven't been partners through the pandemic.  You should be ashamed of yourself.
1331332008430030848 2020-11-25 04:21:00 +0800 <Camelback71> Notice he doesn't add "small" to the "business leaders" who joined his call.  What a fraud you are.

1331308767338659840 2020-11-25 02:48:39 +0800 <Camelback71> I happened to hear these two idiots on Sirius radio this morning. It was vomit-inducing.

1331293544313618434 2020-11-25 01:48:09 +0800 <Camelback71> The withdrawl is going to be a b****.
1331292004320378887 2020-11-25 01:42:02 +0800 <Camelback71> He'll best be remembered for selling out the conservative movement to neo-conservativism, open borders corporatists and the Bush cabal, slandering the good name of Pat Buchanan, and purging other like-minded patriotic conservatives.
1331290776324636672 2020-11-25 01:37:09 +0800 <Camelback71> Look around your workplace pal.  Most of your Republican colleagues are of the same ilk.
1331287949288226818 2020-11-25 01:25:55 +0800 <Camelback71> I'm sure all those White men who founded the country are revered by these foreigners.
1331280636368220162 2020-11-25 00:56:52 +0800 <Camelback71> The White House press room might as well be a fluffers station on a porn shoot for the next 4 years.
1331280140177866753 2020-11-25 00:54:54 +0800 <Camelback71> Too many of us have heard this nonsense for years.  Republican majorities in DC have done nothing to stop the leftward march of the country's culture, politics and educational infrastructure.   If you're a GA Republican who gives up on these frauds, I won't consider you an enemy.
1331270166773071873 2020-11-25 00:15:16 +0800 <Camelback71> I love Democrats pretending to be conservatives correcting Republicans.

1331247391719235593 2020-11-24 22:44:46 +0800 <Camelback71> So illegal expropriation and criminal violence is a-okay with you? Got it.
1331238732318482433 2020-11-24 22:10:21 +0800 <Camelback71> @jonnhy99 @KenCunn77721220 @goldsbie Pretty easy to have crime go down when the police do nothing about blacks terrorizing white farmers and appropriating their land illegally.
1331237944862994432 2020-11-24 22:07:13 +0800 <Camelback71> Even for someone in the pro-vaccination camp, I have to say he does have a point.

1330959026985656320 2020-11-24 03:38:54 +0800 <Camelback71> Every gain from the past four years was done by Trump's pen you gaslighting fraud.  Biden can simply undo these gains with his pen.  He doesn't need Schumer.
1330958402327965696 2020-11-24 03:36:25 +0800 <Camelback71> Tell me how a Republican Senate is going to stop this?  Would they even if they could?

1330925560076242944 2020-11-24 01:25:55 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos They're simply outing themselves for primary challenges. Good.

1330919106900443141 2020-11-24 01:00:17 +0800 <Camelback71> It's a huge problem that won't be solved by enabling schlerotic GOP to control the Senate. You're missing the forest for the trees. The system needs to be discredited and collapse. Perpetuating team GOP just offers false hope that the system just needs some tweaking.
1330913279015718923 2020-11-24 00:37:07 +0800 <Camelback71> They all belong in a dumpster. What's your point?
1330912855302971396 2020-11-24 00:35:26 +0800 <Camelback71> @dennisjsaffran The country's culture and its politics have drifted left for the past 25 years. During that period of time Republicans have had some sort of power for all but 2 years. Tell me what voting Republican accomplishes? Delaying DC statehood for 4 years? Pedophilia legalization?
1330909744924487680 2020-11-24 00:23:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Why?  What purpose does a Senate GOP serve other than delaying implementation of the Left's agenda for 2 years?  The Left is still going to get what they want.
1330909523087814658 2020-11-24 00:22:12 +0800 <Camelback71> Why?  What will a Senate GOP conserve, Ben?
1330909225178996748 2020-11-24 00:21:01 +0800 <Camelback71> @diana_west_ You can stop praying. The people's votes do mean zip and a Republican Senate is little more than speed bump for the Left.
1330908836190855185 2020-11-24 00:19:28 +0800 <Camelback71> Tell me Will, in the past 25 years when we had power what did McConnell, Ryan and other Republicans actually accomplish? What was "conserved"?
1330908368035139584 2020-11-24 00:17:36 +0800 <Camelback71> These aren't "cases".  They're positive tests.  No need to redouble one's efforts on mitigation tactics that don't work anyways.  Masks are pointless.  Families should celebrate Thanksgiving like they do every year and shouldn't listen to you.
1330865245347188738 2020-11-23 21:26:15 +0800 <Camelback71> After watching the country drift left with absolutely no pushback from the right, I highly doubt rank-and-fike GOP base voters are delusional.
1330864382717300738 2020-11-23 21:22:49 +0800 <Camelback71> You have to wonder what voting bloc, other than Acela corridor leftists, this missive appeals to.

1330523637183463424 2020-11-22 22:48:49 +0800 <Camelback71> None of the reasons are very compelling. The system is broken. Sewing more doubt in it is a necessary evil.

1330381997525454849 2020-11-22 13:26:00 +0800 <Camelback71> It's time the GOP stop giving tax cuts to wealthy suburbanites. They hate your guts. As Ace advocates, tax the hell out of them.

1330334133143277568 2020-11-22 10:15:48 +0800 <Camelback71> The problem is this same judge and John Roberts would be bending over to accommodate Biden if the shoe were on the other foot. The sad fact is the system itself needs to be destroyed and along with it the power of the people that populate it.

1330173107303288832 2020-11-21 23:35:56 +0800 <Camelback71> @TedJoy71 No, I'm not. Adams lost. Period.
1330169858919632898 2020-11-21 23:23:02 +0800 <Camelback71> @TedJoy71 Ah, no. And many of the history books that have been written in the last twenty years are woke garbage.
1330169543986192390 2020-11-21 23:21:47 +0800 <Camelback71> This nonsense. Woods' book is widely considered the best that covers that period of history. Now, if you want to talk about "Radicalism of the American Revolution", I'll be probably agree with you.
1330169076350644224 2020-11-21 23:19:55 +0800 <Camelback71> @TedJoy71 We are talking about the election 1800, not 1824.
1330155622470443008 2020-11-21 22:26:28 +0800 <Camelback71> That phone call best sums up the last 25 years of Republican politics. The vast majority people who claim the mantle of conservatism and we continually vote for are despicable, lying backstabbers.

1329989025302605824 2020-11-21 11:24:28 +0800 <Camelback71> Not much of a bottom line if you're depending on any of the Trump three stooges on the Court sticking with Alito and Thomas. At least one will be brought over by Roberts.
1329988172437065729 2020-11-21 11:21:04 +0800 <Camelback71> I'm a non-lawyer but I think Trump is taking part in or masterminding an unlawful conspiracy. Lmao.

1329873076759142400 2020-11-21 03:43:44 +0800 <Camelback71> Compare this to the farce in Georgia run by Rafsenberger.
1329872522146312192 2020-11-21 03:41:31 +0800 <Camelback71> Nothing says integrity like an evidence-free Russia investigation of Trump for 3 years.
1329871597767778304 2020-11-21 03:37:51 +0800 <Camelback71> Jake still thinks he and his colleagues work for a respectable news organization.

1329845747785768962 2020-11-21 01:55:08 +0800 <Camelback71> Funny, I don't remember you ever uttering this sort of thing about Robert Mueller and his Russia, Russia, Russia investigation?
1329840909685379073 2020-11-21 01:35:54 +0800 <Camelback71> Four years of fraudulent investigations of the President and a media narrative peppered with wild conspiracy theories later...
1329840305999278080 2020-11-21 01:33:30 +0800 <Camelback71> For me, this is just as big of an issue as Sidney Powell not going on Tucker.

1329782952461443075 2020-11-20 21:45:36 +0800 <Camelback71> Numbers, period. Legal immigration moratorium. It's 25 years too late but it's a start.
1329782664006561796 2020-11-20 21:44:27 +0800 <Camelback71> Assimilation of the 50 million who've come here in the last 55 years. And that's not counting illegals.
1329782272447311873 2020-11-20 21:42:54 +0800 <Camelback71> No.
1329668288071172096 2020-11-20 14:09:58 +0800 <Camelback71> He's not smarter than the same Cal governor that hosted a no mask, no social distancing  superspreader birthday dinner with fat cats and lobbyists the other day?
1329666760052678657 2020-11-20 14:03:54 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao. These idiots still believe, without evidence, Trump is a secret Russian agent.
1329666299719389188 2020-11-20 14:02:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Just do what you normally do and tell these pricks to f*** off.
1329665322945638401 2020-11-20 13:58:11 +0800 <Camelback71> They'll need to spend it on mental health care for the children locked up in their homes for almost the entirety of 2020. You're a disgrace.
1329664165779161093 2020-11-20 13:53:35 +0800 <Camelback71> So far in court you're batting worse than an American League pitcher in a National League ballpark. We need to see some consequential wins here.
1329663405213433857 2020-11-20 13:50:34 +0800 <Camelback71> You can't. Because we have no idea how much of Biden's votes are actual legal votes.
1329607841569599490 2020-11-20 10:09:47 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos I'm beginning to think the former at this point.
1329607472533827584 2020-11-20 10:08:19 +0800 <Camelback71> This clown continues to dream.  "Coalition government"??? Lmao.
1329607252785856512 2020-11-20 10:07:26 +0800 <Camelback71> Trump would have better off nominating partisan hacks to these court positions rather than established "conservative" judges.  The courts are nothing more than partisan rubber stamps for whatever political party controls the legal culture. And Republicans don't control that.

1328838495910051840 2020-11-18 07:12:40 +0800 <Camelback71> @VDAREJamesK Frm my perspectiv, the Constitution failed only after 1960. Up until then the Court and other branches of govt had shown enough restraint in most instances to keep the system a legitimate enterprise in the eyes of most Americans. Post-1960 Warren Court jurisprudence destroyed it.

1328736537891094528 2020-11-18 00:27:32 +0800 <Camelback71> It's a seasonal virus just like the flu.  There is always going to be spike in cases during certain parts of the year.  Sweden simply acknowledged this.

1328705187389706240 2020-11-17 22:22:57 +0800 <Camelback71> None of this is true.

1328677522477707265 2020-11-17 20:33:01 +0800 <Camelback71> The CDC now says otherwise. Doesn't matter. Masks don't work.
1328587268970450951 2020-11-17 14:34:23 +0800 <Camelback71> Diversity is a cancer on the GOP no less than the country.
1328586706631733251 2020-11-17 14:32:09 +0800 <Camelback71> Of course you will. DC is the only place in America where proven screw-ups and incompetents Iike yourself fail upwards.
1328583552183783432 2020-11-17 14:19:37 +0800 <Camelback71> @oblivious_guy Agreed. The system is broken. But the hurdle is convincing normies to destroy it -- Declaration, Constitution, all of it.
1328582546364522496 2020-11-17 14:15:37 +0800 <Camelback71> I never said I wanted Biden to win, wink, wink, nod, nod, but... I do.
1328582148153028614 2020-11-17 14:14:02 +0800 <Camelback71> Philadelphia's Democrat machine is now literally spitting in the face of Trump and his voters at this point. They don't fear any court undoing any of this lawlessness.

1328557940999999490 2020-11-17 12:37:51 +0800 <Camelback71> Of course not. It's not a universal religion.
1328554958602395654 2020-11-17 12:26:00 +0800 <Camelback71> Funny how the South became more Republican as it became less racist.
1328554465486540800 2020-11-17 12:24:02 +0800 <Camelback71> Nobody asked for the demographics to change. Especially Georgians.
1328554157792395264 2020-11-17 12:22:49 +0800 <Camelback71> The entire GOP state party in Georgia appears to have outed itself as a collection of Never Trumpers.
1328552242589224960 2020-11-17 12:15:12 +0800 <Camelback71> Masks don't work anyways.
1328538820988440577 2020-11-17 11:21:52 +0800 <Camelback71> So what?  If you do get the virus you have a 99.8% of surviving it.
1328538690889531392 2020-11-17 11:21:21 +0800 <Camelback71> The easiest and simplest measure to take is to live our lives like we did before March of 2020.  The IFR for the virus is slightly higher than the flu.  It's not the plague.
1328537876418576384 2020-11-17 11:18:07 +0800 <Camelback71> Check out the comments.  The idiocy is more contagious than the virus.

1328488358926897152 2020-11-17 08:01:21 +0800 <Camelback71> So it isn't about any grand mission.  It's about saving face.
1328487196416823296 2020-11-17 07:56:44 +0800 <Camelback71> And @dougducey will roll over and institute all of these restrictions.
1328476197223759872 2020-11-17 07:13:01 +0800 <Camelback71> @JimDelRey @waelse1 America-first nationalism arose 25 years too late. Buchanan's rejection in the 1990s was the biggest mistake made by GOP voters of the last 30 years. Conservatives tried to warn the GOP of their fate if they continued with Hart-Cellar and did nothing to stop illegal immigration.
1328475103521165312 2020-11-17 07:08:41 +0800 <Camelback71> @JimDelRey @waelse1 Unfortunately, future Republicans would use what was supposed to be a fix (tax cuts) tailored for a specific set of circumstances as a way to satiate the rubes when they failed follow through on policies addressing social issues.
1328474204606382081 2020-11-17 07:05:06 +0800 <Camelback71> @JimDelRey @waelse1 No, we were counting on that thing called the conservative movement and the GOP Congress of the 1990s to follow through on that. Alas, the entire conservative enterprise has been a fraud.
1328473432002969600 2020-11-17 07:02:02 +0800 <Camelback71> @truthtroll84 @waelse1 @RonColeman @JimDelRey Gowdy? Lmao. No. He's as much of a fraud as Paul Ryan is.
1328453426204733440 2020-11-17 05:42:32 +0800 <Camelback71> @waelse1 @JimDelRey Reagan had many endearing qualities and his unwavering stance and policies vis-a-vi the Soviet Union deserves the country's everlasting appreciation.  That being said, Trump was the superior conservative but Trump too had his shortcomings, esp when it comes to legal immigration.
1328452823068012545 2020-11-17 05:40:09 +0800 <Camelback71> This same chump peddled a conspiracy theory for three years that Donald Trump was a Russian agent in the employ of Vladimir Putin.
1328448028923969536 2020-11-17 05:21:06 +0800 <Camelback71> This idiot literally wrote an entire book on "liberal fascism" and can't identify a militant Red Guard when he sees it.
1328433375384797185 2020-11-17 04:22:52 +0800 <Camelback71> @waelse1 @JimDelRey Reagan wasn't even the ideal Republican.  In many respects he was a typical Republican.  Delivered on his economic agenda, completely punted on social issues and made a huge error in appointing Anthony Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor to the bench.
1328431789304545281 2020-11-17 04:16:34 +0800 <Camelback71> @GregKuhn56601 @JimDelRey ...and many supposed conservatives in my state keep buying it.  It's maddening.
1328413033740156928 2020-11-17 03:02:02 +0800 <Camelback71> The government and the politicians and bureaucrats who bless it are just as much in on the scam as the colleges and universities.
1328412303818047488 2020-11-17 02:59:08 +0800 <Camelback71> He'll still be saying this when we take the vaccine. These people need to be tossed to the curb.
1328411893011156993 2020-11-17 02:57:30 +0800 <Camelback71> Woke ER nurse simply makes stories up to denigrate her own patients.  Why do I want to share a country with these people?  Why do I have to?
1328344513329258498 2020-11-16 22:29:46 +0800 <Camelback71> Maybe don't worry about the virus and just live your life like you did before March of this year.
1328344143442046978 2020-11-16 22:28:17 +0800 <Camelback71> Insane.
1328343992795238400 2020-11-16 22:27:41 +0800 <Camelback71> Sweden hasn't. It's back to normalcy.
1328343756597182464 2020-11-16 22:26:45 +0800 <Camelback71> This guy, apparently, wants to lock you in your basement in perpetuity.

1328342323462225920 2020-11-16 22:21:03 +0800 <Camelback71> This is pure horseshit. Most countries who have mask mandates have 90-100% compliance and the virus still thrives. Cloth masks are useless.
1328330141760585730 2020-11-16 21:32:39 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, that's the part of this research I'm not really buying.
1328329799379554306 2020-11-16 21:31:18 +0800 <Camelback71> Sweetheart, Trump greenlit Moderna's vaccine research back in January of this year.
1328327699627053056 2020-11-16 21:22:57 +0800 <Camelback71> This douchebag simply cares about the rotting corpse that is the establishment Republican Party. If you're still listening to his radio show you're just as much of a problem as he is.
1328326825429377026 2020-11-16 21:19:28 +0800 <Camelback71> Testing asymptomatics has nothing to do with these alarming statistics, I'm sure.
1328260829473615872 2020-11-16 16:57:14 +0800 <Camelback71> Those without student loan debt aren't Biden voters anyways. This is about solidifying the white college educated voting bloc for Democrats. The sad fact is Trump should have done this before the election.
1328257350164070401 2020-11-16 16:43:24 +0800 <Camelback71> It's not white people's fault your family couldn't cook a turkey all these years.
1328256605230563329 2020-11-16 16:40:27 +0800 <Camelback71> So you're okay with the law that throws people in jail for such speech in PUBLIC?

1328159960954404865 2020-11-16 10:16:25 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist He sounds like he's upset he couldn't be the tyrant. The GOP is garbage.
1328159317262880768 2020-11-16 10:13:51 +0800 <Camelback71> She stole a Trump flag and brandished a knife. She's lucky this was her fate.

1327997671571800064 2020-11-15 23:31:32 +0800 <Camelback71> Why are you terrified? The police did nothing to protect these people yesterday.
1327997152727945217 2020-11-15 23:29:28 +0800 <Camelback71> I hear the Governor of South Dakota will take them in.
1327979500596916224 2020-11-15 22:19:20 +0800 <Camelback71> @MrIgnite4 They take orders from Democratic chief and mayor. End of story.

1327836687225872386 2020-11-15 12:51:50 +0800 <Camelback71> A disgrace? It's criminal.
1327834870312173568 2020-11-15 12:44:37 +0800 <Camelback71> This shit is wearing thin. The current President is named Trump and it's happening NOW.
1327831484904837120 2020-11-15 12:31:10 +0800 <Camelback71> Ask President Trump. At present, he doesn't seem to care.
1327821807127130113 2020-11-15 11:52:43 +0800 <Camelback71> All I see are six of those evil things called white men.
1327809787464060929 2020-11-15 11:04:57 +0800 <Camelback71> @oblivious_guy Antifa crashed the Trump rally tonight.
1327807057764917250 2020-11-15 10:54:06 +0800 <Camelback71> Trump is still President. And continues to do nothing. I'm sorry but that's the truth.

1327806446197608448 2020-11-15 10:51:40 +0800 <Camelback71> Local media just dropped me a note: What's happening in DC isn't actually happening. It isn't happening so we're not covering it.

1327795017478377472 2020-11-15 10:06:16 +0800 <Camelback71> Nonsense.
1327794922951376896 2020-11-15 10:05:53 +0800 <Camelback71> Legal immigration, good! Illegal immigration, bad! Lmao
1327786803395379202 2020-11-15 09:33:37 +0800 <Camelback71> This is nonsense. This election millions of mail-in ballots. Such ballots are ground zero for fraud you twat.

1327763035507724288 2020-11-15 07:59:10 +0800 <Camelback71> The liberal experiment - of the multicultural variety, is, at this point,  a failure. No magical coalition is going to save it and make it work.
1327762092477140992 2020-11-15 07:55:26 +0800 <Camelback71> Your first mistake is in assuming their careers are destroyed. The real money in politics is found outside elected office.

1327646702816301056 2020-11-15 00:16:55 +0800 <Camelback71> Who'd have thunk it?
1327634773838237697 2020-11-14 23:29:31 +0800 <Camelback71> @TrustThePlant I think the odds on this are pretty damn good.
1327613697754243074 2020-11-14 22:05:46 +0800 <Camelback71> You don't think that's going to stop him?
1327613427322212353 2020-11-14 22:04:41 +0800 <Camelback71> He's going to deal with the virus just as Cuomo and de Blasio have you twit.

1327349194890252288 2020-11-14 04:34:43 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos Trump is finding out most of the people he appointed to positions in his administration were never his friends or his allies.  They never even felt that he was their boss.  They only answer to those outside government offering them a golden parachute.
1327336679712063490 2020-11-14 03:44:59 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin Ya, this "multiracial" only works if the candidates we run are actual populists and stooges of big business. And quite frankly I'm not sure these minority voters won't succumb to the identity politics card played by the Democrats.

All you have to do is look at the advertisements that are run on talk radio programs, Newsmax TV, OANN and even Fox.

1326598546758406144 2020-11-12 02:51:55 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin Of that I have no doubt. Most professors today don't even do in class teaching. They have instructors do it, most of whom are indoctrinated robots. By the way, Larry Sabato was one of my thesis sponsors. And he's become a rabid frothy Leftist in the last 20 years.

I wish I could say it makes me an expert but the sad fact is I've learned more about politics and history outside the academy than I ever did in it.  In the academy you don't read Bork or Johnson, you read Sunstein, Tribe and Zinn.

1326578844875194368 2020-11-12 01:33:37 +0800 <Camelback71> @tonib The inescapable truth, after reading John's thread is this: The system is irreparably broken. Republics only survive in certain habitats. America changed its entire ecosystem in the last 50 years. The only fix available to us now is to tear it all down.
1326575161743613952 2020-11-12 01:18:59 +0800 <Camelback71> @ThatParentP4P Unfortunately, I think you're right.

1326526332474335232 2020-11-11 22:04:57 +0800 <Camelback71> Nearly every "real world" study they point to is linked to coorelation, not causation. It's junk science.

1326310198588264450 2020-11-11 07:46:07 +0800 <Camelback71> Polls are so reliable these days.
1326308274136735745 2020-11-11 07:38:28 +0800 <Camelback71> Nonsense. Masks don't "control the virus" either. Wearing a mask is nothing more than a virtue signal.
1326303291223896064 2020-11-11 07:18:40 +0800 <Camelback71> Yup.

1326285187286671361 2020-11-11 06:06:44 +0800 <Camelback71> Sounds good to me.
1326284830842089473 2020-11-11 06:05:19 +0800 <Camelback71> Her job isn't to start up a transition for a President-Elect that isn't one.
1326284436724277248 2020-11-11 06:03:45 +0800 <Camelback71> No.  He's not President-Elect of anything.

1326230949076508672 2020-11-11 02:31:13 +0800 <Camelback71> @oblivious_guy 93% of registered Republican voters voted for Trump. He seems to either be under the delusion that Never Trump Republicans number in the millions or he knows his future lies with maybe 15% of Democrats all of whom are clones if Joe Lieberman.
1326222280125394944 2020-11-11 01:56:46 +0800 <Camelback71> Worked in enough DC law firms to know you'll be lucky to find 10 conservative lawyers among a nest of 150.  And at least 100 are hard core leftists. That doesn't even include the underemployed staff attorneys and paralegals, many of whom are foreign born (diversity!) and AWFLs.
1326220746830434304 2020-11-11 01:50:40 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos I've been shadow banned for the better part of two years I think.  I highly doubt Rick Wilson and his jerk-off colleagues even saw my re-tweet.
1326219591136108546 2020-11-11 01:46:05 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£  If I'm getting kicked off Twitter, I'll die knowing I did it for a good cause.
1326219345362518017 2020-11-11 01:45:06 +0800 <Camelback71> They didn't lose their minds.  And their federal, state and local government officials didn't either.
1326196009567883264 2020-11-11 00:12:22 +0800 <Camelback71> Four years ago we had normal election.
1326195385585467392 2020-11-11 00:09:54 +0800 <Camelback71> Almost as good as an audit.  I'm hoping their observers can flag questionable ballots, especially those with only a Joe Biden checkmark and nothing marked down ballot.
1326194094897442818 2020-11-11 00:04:46 +0800 <Camelback71> Thanks for outing yourself as a stooge for the state GOP.
1326193590591086593 2020-11-11 00:02:46 +0800 <Camelback71> @DemandDanielAZ @JamesTHarris He did have some choice words for you yesterday on his show.  I'm not surprised.  But here's the thing:  He's either a knowing stooge for the Arizona GOP or he really is clueless about who actually runs the state party.  Either way, he's a burden.
1326192688153030656 2020-11-10 23:59:10 +0800 <Camelback71> @HeritageAmeric6 "They're boomers" -- well, of course they are. üòÇ
1326172145286701056 2020-11-10 22:37:33 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, firing a probable subversive in your administration is the equivalent of Kristallnact.
1326170250853851136 2020-11-10 22:30:01 +0800 <Camelback71> The Constitution says otherwise.
1326165611399974913 2020-11-10 22:11:35 +0800 <Camelback71> And?
1326160973854486529 2020-11-10 21:53:09 +0800 <Camelback71> He isn't POTUS-elect.
1326002664983957504 2020-11-10 11:24:05 +0800 <Camelback71> It's all Trump's fault! Lmao
1326002375069323264 2020-11-10 11:22:56 +0800 <Camelback71> @blanarovich Fyi- CNN never called Arizona for Biden.
1325994007588057088 2020-11-10 10:49:41 +0800 <Camelback71> @PolitiHate @subiectat Thanks. The Big Short is a great movie.
1325979369811058689 2020-11-10 09:51:31 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin "How dare you question us!"
1325979182682173443 2020-11-10 09:50:47 +0800 <Camelback71> You know what they call former Republican lawmakers? New Democratic voters.
1325977343882526720 2020-11-10 09:43:28 +0800 <Camelback71> We had a normal election in 2016, you twit. No mass mail-in ballots, less early voting and the counting did not stop at 3 a.m. in each of the crucial swing states.
1325976511862595584 2020-11-10 09:40:10 +0800 <Camelback71> Hey mate, stick to kangaroos and politics in that penal colony you live in.
1325975468860829697 2020-11-10 09:36:01 +0800 <Camelback71> Okay Mr. Gatekeeper and excuse maker for stolen elections.
1325957763726364672 2020-11-10 08:25:40 +0800 <Camelback71> Surprise, surprise, surprise!
1325949556920475648 2020-11-10 07:53:03 +0800 <Camelback71> If the courts demand this as proof, the Trump Team will need to force audits in PA, MI and WI. Recounts won't cut it. They need to inspect every ballot, especially the Biden-only ballots. Chances of that? Less than 20%.
1325948418112434182 2020-11-10 07:48:32 +0800 <Camelback71> @slangford77 Good grief, we have near 100% compliance in most places. They don't work.

1325933763067486208 2020-11-10 06:50:18 +0800 <Camelback71> Hmmm... checking the calendar.  It's been almost a week since Election Day and this guy finally pipes up. Let's face it, he had no plans to do this.  He was forced to pop his head up.
1325933204021207040 2020-11-10 06:48:05 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried My Facebook is filled with normie friends.  They're all scrambling to find something elese to watch like NewsMax.  They see what Fox is becoming.
1325932108150312960 2020-11-10 06:43:43 +0800 <Camelback71> Good God, it's not the plague.
1325931730423836672 2020-11-10 06:42:13 +0800 <Camelback71> @OLDLADYBOOBZ The Golf Channel is generally okay even with Brandel Chamblee saying something stupid once in a while.  ESPN is a whole other story and the CBS telecast on Sunday should be fine although I will barf when I see Nantz and Faldo in masks.
1325930943073320966 2020-11-10 06:39:06 +0800 <Camelback71> @OLDLADYBOOBZ Let's hope The Golf Channel, ESPN and CBS stick with the golf and eschew the politics -- for at least one week.  Ah, hell, who am I kidding?
1325929711155830784 2020-11-10 06:34:12 +0800 <Camelback71> @slangford77 This conversation is pointless anyways.  Most European countries have been wearing masks for months.  They're going through another major wave. Most American cities and a good number of states have mask mandates and the cases are now again on the rise.  They don't work.
1325924429239644162 2020-11-10 06:13:13 +0800 <Camelback71> Oh no! Lmao.
1325923519834681344 2020-11-10 06:09:36 +0800 <Camelback71> You're surprised?
1325922843624841216 2020-11-10 06:06:55 +0800 <Camelback71> The only pulling numbers out of his ass is you. IFR is slightly higher than the flu.  The median age of death is 78 years old you buffoon.  Please do continue with the panic porn.
1325918125666136064 2020-11-10 05:48:10 +0800 <Camelback71> They're pot committed on becoming MSNBC. No need to bitch about it any further.
1325917406225555456 2020-11-10 05:45:18 +0800 <Camelback71> @slangford77 So, in other words, the IFR is actually more than 99.9% survivable? 200,000 dead in 8 months? I highly doubt we're hitting 3.3 million.  Lmao.  Stop spreading panic porn. We have a casedemic which in reality is a positive test-demic because most people don't have any symptoms.
1325915479869853696 2020-11-10 05:37:39 +0800 <Camelback71> This is the ballgame here.  Nevada is a sideshow at this point.  It's why Schlapp and his useless gaslighters are there.
1325914791861366784 2020-11-10 05:34:55 +0800 <Camelback71> Sorry to break it to you Kelly but it's up to your colleagues in the Senate and House to start publicly supporting Trump in this post-election period and eschew any recognition of Biden as "President-elect".  Otherwise, we'll let you twist in the wind.
1325913833123192832 2020-11-10 05:31:06 +0800 <Camelback71> You'll try to do better but in the end you're still the hypocrite.
1325913463911145472 2020-11-10 05:29:38 +0800 <Camelback71> @slangford77 Wearing a mask for a virus that has a survivability rate of 99% is just plain stupid, pointless and dare I say it, even laughable.
1325912906299449344 2020-11-10 05:27:25 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos They still don't get it.  Neither of those clueless clowns.
1325900099570987009 2020-11-10 04:36:32 +0800 <Camelback71> They did take federal money you, moron.
1325899788391391232 2020-11-10 04:35:18 +0800 <Camelback71> I've barfed up my lunch.
1325899627963379712 2020-11-10 04:34:39 +0800 <Camelback71> Green bean casserole is gross.  There, I said it.  Mashed sweet potatoes, not the orange yams, are the best.
1325898660584939520 2020-11-10 04:30:49 +0800 <Camelback71> @slangford77 Mask nazis make jokes!
1325893691001638912 2020-11-10 04:11:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Didn't know I breathed out my ass.
1325893394426519552 2020-11-10 04:09:53 +0800 <Camelback71> Listen to these loon toons.
1325891563675742208 2020-11-10 04:02:37 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin I could do without the likes of Seb Gorka and all of the MAGA grifters that are sure to follow.  I love Trump.  But some of his grifting sycophants are no better than the Bush grifters.
1325890880004239361 2020-11-10 03:59:54 +0800 <Camelback71> This is a lie. They damn well took Warp Speed dollars.
1325890229237018625 2020-11-10 03:57:19 +0800 <Camelback71> Katie I wouldn't get all excited over something that's probably turning out exactly the opposite of what you might think.
1325889842794754049 2020-11-10 03:55:47 +0800 <Camelback71> Pfizer took $2 billion in cash from Uncle Sam to help develop this vaccine.
1325888681530466305 2020-11-10 03:51:10 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin NewsmaxTV has Michelle Malkin on the weekends - should be M-F presence but I'll take it.  The fact is one of the two is going to be invaded by the castaways at Fox during the next few months.  And I'm not a fan of many of the presumed castaways -- Lou Dobbs being the exception.
1325884886792630272 2020-11-10 03:36:05 +0800 <Camelback71> @PolitiHate Republicans are too numerous within the Georgia state government not to at least make this much of a public admission.  The Democrat administrations in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin?  They'll have to be dragged kicking and screaming to call this sort of press conference.
1325884173031124993 2020-11-10 03:33:15 +0800 <Camelback71> Matt is depressed his precious Fox News isn't available to propagate his ACU gatekeeping.  Let's hope Newsmax and OAN aren't coopted by this globalist, neoliberal stooge.
1325882997069869059 2020-11-10 03:28:34 +0800 <Camelback71> Amen.
1325869539435843584 2020-11-10 02:35:06 +0800 <Camelback71> @OLDLADYBOOBZ @tonib Heavy bass and baritone.  Like my pup.
1325866208764178435 2020-11-10 02:21:52 +0800 <Camelback71> If America was never a white country, no country in Africa was ever a black one.
1325865025953673216 2020-11-10 02:17:10 +0800 <Camelback71> Apparently this is what Biden means by "healing" the nation.
1325844325427601410 2020-11-10 00:54:54 +0800 <Camelback71> If I've said it once (and I have), I'll say it again: She's garbage.
1325837095517130755 2020-11-10 00:26:11 +0800 <Camelback71> Don't forget Brian Kilmeade.
1325825615283384322 2020-11-09 23:40:33 +0800 <Camelback71> Resistance!
1325797184898412544 2020-11-09 21:47:35 +0800 <Camelback71> Voter fraud.
1325754441098698752 2020-11-09 18:57:44 +0800 <Camelback71> We aren't on to Georgia. Trump's case in the courts is priority number one.
1325754185413849088 2020-11-09 18:56:43 +0800 <Camelback71> The list won't have @hughhewitt's name. He's moved on.
1325753199010017280 2020-11-09 18:52:48 +0800 <Camelback71> This is laughable. Most of his important accomplishments were done with a phone and a pen, not laws.
1325752076844982272 2020-11-09 18:48:21 +0800 <Camelback71> Don't give one dime to these races. Nothing.
1325670446386176002 2020-11-09 13:23:58 +0800 <Camelback71> Fact check: False.
1325630841662287872 2020-11-09 10:46:36 +0800 <Camelback71> I think the mirrors in my house all cracked when I read this.
1325616524313333760 2020-11-09 09:49:42 +0800 <Camelback71> Recounts will discover nothing. You need audits (i.e. physical inspection of each and every ballot).
1325615547409575937 2020-11-09 09:45:49 +0800 <Camelback71> Who the hell pays for this crap?
1325595574150680576 2020-11-09 08:26:27 +0800 <Camelback71> No. For four years you stood silent while the Left dragged Trump and his supporters through the gutter.
1325573850239660032 2020-11-09 07:00:08 +0800 <Camelback71> More gaslighting and grifting. It's what the Schlapps are all about.
1325559515488546816 2020-11-09 06:03:10 +0800 <Camelback71> You just choose not to see it.
1325559223829192704 2020-11-09 06:02:01 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao. You gave oxygen to the Russia hoax just like other neocon Never Trumpers. You don't deserve some fair play card.
1325540320407269377 2020-11-09 04:46:54 +0800 <Camelback71> True.
1325533694841384960 2020-11-09 04:20:34 +0800 <Camelback71> No.
1325532694378246145 2020-11-09 04:16:36 +0800 <Camelback71> You should sit down, sweetie. You never gave Trump any benefit of the doubt.
1325512445918502912 2020-11-09 02:56:08 +0800 <Camelback71> Cheney conservatism is back in business.
1325494585561210880 2020-11-09 01:45:10 +0800 <Camelback71> So @dougducey? @GarretLewis
1325494112569626625 2020-11-09 01:43:17 +0800 <Camelback71> Modi to college educated white men and women: Suckers!
1325493435537653761 2020-11-09 01:40:36 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao quisling.
1325491203693973506 2020-11-09 01:31:44 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya Roland you were *so* persecuted during the last four years. Similar in so many respects to the Jim Crow South.
1325490605850415104 2020-11-09 01:29:21 +0800 <Camelback71> I'm sorry but why should patriots even try to help the GOP retain the Senate seats in GA if this sort of shit is simply going to be repeated?
1325489604938461186 2020-11-09 01:25:22 +0800 <Camelback71> We put with you being a Dick on this platform every day buddy.
1325454296335331331 2020-11-08 23:05:04 +0800 <Camelback71> This is meant to be dark humor, right?
1325453348745617408 2020-11-08 23:01:18 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao. You're bat shit nuts.
1325450465211871232 2020-11-08 22:49:51 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao.
1325440439915175936 2020-11-08 22:10:01 +0800 <Camelback71> They rebuilt it through the largest mail-in ballot harvesting scam of all time.
1325438761677717505 2020-11-08 22:03:20 +0800 <Camelback71> She really believes this bullshit.

1325415726283333633 2020-11-08 20:31:48 +0800 <Camelback71> @zones2surf I agree. She didn't get anywhere near the exposure the others have. And I think she's very right wing
1325415355964039169 2020-11-08 20:30:20 +0800 <Camelback71> They don't work. The only reason to do so is to "set an example" of control.
1325413698052083712 2020-11-08 20:23:45 +0800 <Camelback71> How bout none of them? Most of us would like to have some new blood on our TV screens.
1325411723277299712 2020-11-08 20:15:54 +0800 <Camelback71> Hard pass.
1325409724813070337 2020-11-08 20:07:57 +0800 <Camelback71> Sweetheart, most conservatives on here are shadowbanned. We're talking to an echo chamber already.
1325409128777314305 2020-11-08 20:05:35 +0800 <Camelback71> He didn't mean a word of it you gullible moron.
1325314089833279488 2020-11-08 13:47:56 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, those masks really work. üòÇü§£üòÇ
1325313414806171648 2020-11-08 13:45:15 +0800 <Camelback71> Congrats, M!
1325312307686113280 2020-11-08 13:40:51 +0800 <Camelback71> F*** off, Rich.
1325312020388827139 2020-11-08 13:39:43 +0800 <Camelback71> So much for moving the embassy to Jerusalem...
1325285578665938945 2020-11-08 11:54:39 +0800 <Camelback71> Who reads Rich Lowry's trash website anymore anyways? @davidharsanyi find a new employer, this rag is done.
1325285065673224192 2020-11-08 11:52:36 +0800 <Camelback71> Quite frankly, other than the Judge they'll all get in line by next week. A paycheck is at stake.
1325284310954332160 2020-11-08 11:49:36 +0800 <Camelback71> You talk as if he's the past tense. Get on board the flight or be primaried very soon.

1325282664044060672 2020-11-08 11:43:04 +0800 <Camelback71> This moron might be the most vomit inducing blue check on Twitter. And that's saying something.

1325271943868682242 2020-11-08 11:00:28 +0800 <Camelback71> This is a giant sized radiation induced whopper. But hey Pravda had to come up with this kind of propaganda in the Soviet Union.
1325240076377317376 2020-11-08 08:53:50 +0800 <Camelback71> Have to keep foreign dollars flowing into the corrupt McCain Institute.
1325239877466685441 2020-11-08 08:53:03 +0800 <Camelback71> Third World leaders know a good ol' election fraud when they see one.
1325236564104900608 2020-11-08 08:39:53 +0800 <Camelback71> Why the f*** aren't you going? Are you on the front lines or not?
1325224563496476672 2020-11-08 07:52:12 +0800 <Camelback71> Another surrender monkey.
1325224390917648384 2020-11-08 07:51:30 +0800 <Camelback71> Another "conservative" talker who has surrendered. @GarretLewis
1325223268484145152 2020-11-08 07:47:03 +0800 <Camelback71> Really? Let's see what the courts and legislatures say.
1325208239085031425 2020-11-08 06:47:20 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao.
1325208040082006016 2020-11-08 06:46:32 +0800 <Camelback71> Biden hasn't won.
1325198809643823105 2020-11-08 06:09:51 +0800 <Camelback71> "cultural signifiers" = the historic American nation.
1325198453572431872 2020-11-08 06:08:26 +0800 <Camelback71> Ah, so Biden stole it. Yawn. Let's move on.
1325197969440698368 2020-11-08 06:06:31 +0800 <Camelback71> All of 5 people will be listening.
1325197558428303374 2020-11-08 06:04:53 +0800 <Camelback71> Dream on, Eric. Biden can get alot of this simply through a phone and a pen.
1325175706192543746 2020-11-08 04:38:03 +0800 <Camelback71> Only an idiot who doesn't play the game would say something this stupid.
1325155405991800832 2020-11-08 03:17:23 +0800 <Camelback71> Any other quisling Republicans in office or in punditry join the usual suspects in congratulating Fraudulent-elect Biden?
1325153674264342531 2020-11-08 03:10:30 +0800 <Camelback71> Slimebag.
1325153297477496841 2020-11-08 03:09:00 +0800 <Camelback71> Maybe he'll actually say something in support of the President. Doubt it, though.
1325153114198962177 2020-11-08 03:08:17 +0800 <Camelback71> He's not President-elect of anything.
1325119015023378433 2020-11-08 00:52:47 +0800 <Camelback71> Nonsense.
1325118746013265924 2020-11-08 00:51:43 +0800 <Camelback71> Your network is dead in the water at this point. Enjoy those Oxygen network ratings, Bret.
1325116699331317766 2020-11-08 00:43:35 +0800 <Camelback71> Al Gore was too. Lmao.
1325115877734248455 2020-11-08 00:40:19 +0800 <Camelback71> Doesn't need one. He has a phone and a pen. DACA is back, critical race theory lectures are back, foreign abortion counseling is back, the Wall is defunded, Durham is gone and Flynn, barring a pardon, will go to jail.
1325115026277986304 2020-11-08 00:36:56 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao.
1325114505462906881 2020-11-08 00:34:52 +0800 <Camelback71> 5 days after election night, after each of the crucial states halted the vote counts with Trump comfortably ahead in each of them.
1325113140137193472 2020-11-08 00:29:26 +0800 <Camelback71> @ScottMGreer I deal with her office on a weekly basis. A brain dead wine aunt has a higher IQ.
1325110835451105281 2020-11-08 00:20:17 +0800 <Camelback71> I believe there is good chunk of votes also coming in from Cochise and Yavapai counties. Should be Trump heavy.
1325108084927180800 2020-11-08 00:09:21 +0800 <Camelback71> "Intellectual" racist and cancerous lesion continues his neverending lecture of whi pypl on racism.

1325074798909685763 2020-11-07 21:57:05 +0800 <Camelback71> All those Republican voters *miraculously* showed up the cities of Milwaukee, Detroit, Atlanta and Philadelphia.
1325074224499683330 2020-11-07 21:54:48 +0800 <Camelback71> They're not going to cancel your student debt, sweetie.
1325034183077457922 2020-11-07 19:15:41 +0800 <Camelback71> Nothing to see. Move along. Move along.
1325033984955359232 2020-11-07 19:14:54 +0800 <Camelback71> Drew decided to fry part of his left lobe and eat it for a late night snack.
1324916117295435776 2020-11-07 11:26:32 +0800 <Camelback71> Next thing you know he'll be inviting the Never Trumpers back on his show.
1324915617112059904 2020-11-07 11:24:33 +0800 <Camelback71> Who's surprised this guy is surrendering?

1324892869509853184 2020-11-07 09:54:10 +0800 <Camelback71> @demontage2000 @dsoswald Do they have to provide data or is it simply a phone call to the PA SoS. "Hey, ya, we're segregating the ballots"?
1324892359394385922 2020-11-07 09:52:08 +0800 <Camelback71> Should Trump clear 55% in Maricopa, the 37k combined in Pinal, Yavapai and Cochise counties will be key.
1324890636508520449 2020-11-07 09:45:17 +0800 <Camelback71> You are.
1324890503679148032 2020-11-07 09:44:46 +0800 <Camelback71> I'm sure @AndrewCMcCarthy will excuse this away too.
1324888683888091136 2020-11-07 09:37:32 +0800 <Camelback71> @OLDLADYBOOBZ I hope they allow the Red Cross to inspect these camps.

1324848215875706880 2020-11-07 06:56:43 +0800 <Camelback71> Yes, it's all Trump's fault now.
1324847295888723968 2020-11-07 06:53:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Baseball Cuck simply wants the GOP base voters to fall in line.  He and his buddies in conservative media still want to run the show.

1324828566001917952 2020-11-07 05:38:38 +0800 <Camelback71> Marjorie actually loves and respects those that voted for her.  Can the same be said of you?

1324786394347184128 2020-11-07 02:51:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Who wants to bet this awesome new Republican Senate (if there is one) assists Joe Biden in making "Juneteenth" a federal holiday?
1324785322828341248 2020-11-07 02:46:48 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao. He has no idea what has just happened.
1324777110515326976 2020-11-07 02:14:10 +0800 <Camelback71> Here's the line up of Salem hosts: Prager, Gallagher, Hewitt, Gorka and Elder. All garbage. Tune them out.
1324773169635356672 2020-11-07 01:58:31 +0800 <Camelback71> Can't wait for Rich's new book on praising the Graham and Rubio's new Gang of 8 immigration reform bill a year from now.
1324772202877657088 2020-11-07 01:54:40 +0800 <Camelback71> Why did you have any faith in him in the first place?  He denigrated the young college students who dared to question his cheerleading of legal immigration during 2019-2020.  He's W Bush garbage.
1324771798919962624 2020-11-07 01:53:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Don't keep that seat of yours warm in the House.  Your political career is dead, buddy. Dead.

1324750479859937282 2020-11-07 00:28:21 +0800 <Camelback71> You voted for a corpse.

1324744197509804032 2020-11-07 00:03:23 +0800 <Camelback71> No, it's the best long term scenario for NR to pull off it's grift.

1324729506268016642 2020-11-06 23:05:01 +0800 <Camelback71> Apparently, Biden earning 80,000-90,000 extra ballot, not just votes, than down ballot ticket Dems also "not surprising."
1324723009299492865 2020-11-06 22:39:12 +0800 <Camelback71> Cheering on blatant election stealing is a really good look for you.

1324715914399416322 2020-11-06 22:11:00 +0800 <Camelback71> Fuck off.
1324709629054443520 2020-11-06 21:46:02 +0800 <Camelback71> Republicans aren't sweeping anything in 2022. They're leaving Trump out to dry and need primaried.
1324707834974531585 2020-11-06 21:38:54 +0800 <Camelback71> It was CivNat garbage.
1324707154335461378 2020-11-06 21:36:12 +0800 <Camelback71> It's 2020, NR hasnt been a conservative magazine for over 10 years.
1324705348830162944 2020-11-06 21:29:01 +0800 <Camelback71> Keep in mind this fool hedged his bet about Trump being a Russian spy for two years and swallowed whole the Steele Dossier.
1324583478281687042 2020-11-06 13:24:45 +0800 <Camelback71> There's a truck full of irregularities in Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee.
1324581671333621760 2020-11-06 13:17:34 +0800 <Camelback71> This is nonsense
1324580218325983233 2020-11-06 13:11:48 +0800 <Camelback71> Apparently this fat f*** is a Republican.
1324577249065013249 2020-11-06 13:00:00 +0800 <Camelback71> Yup.
1324488674927472641 2020-11-06 07:08:02 +0800 <Camelback71> Who are you kidding?  You and CPAC can't live without such grifters.
1324488469373054976 2020-11-06 07:07:13 +0800 <Camelback71> Just another AWFL who simply couldn't stand Trump's brash personal style.  If she were a Republican at this point she'd have looked past that considering what he's done the last 4 years.
1324478901096120321 2020-11-06 06:29:12 +0800 <Camelback71> He talks of the Trump presidency as if it's the past tense.
1324468124062679040 2020-11-06 05:46:22 +0800 <Camelback71> Apparently, the establishment GOP got the memo but it's all just canned talking points. They have no stomach to actually fight for Trump. The moment Fox News calls PA, they'll ask Trump to quit. You watch.
1324467005202731008 2020-11-06 05:41:56 +0800 <Camelback71> This is why Nevada, Arizona, and Pittsburgh have all delayed their vote counts.  They're waiting on Philadelphia to put Biden over the top.
1324465697125101569 2020-11-06 05:36:44 +0800 <Camelback71> It took her two days to say a damn word. Worthless.
1324464966544445440 2020-11-06 05:33:50 +0800 <Camelback71> They don't even care if it looks like like fraud at this point.  They're simply spitting in half the country's face.
1324455562826805248 2020-11-06 04:56:28 +0800 <Camelback71> All you do is introduce new bills that GO ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE.
1324451502652444672 2020-11-06 04:40:20 +0800 <Camelback71> He's a stooge for the Chamber but hey at least he's spoken up.
1324451009045819393 2020-11-06 04:38:22 +0800 <Camelback71> The House GOP is finding out the Constitution is a pretty toothless document without someone to actually enforce it.
1324448499182628864 2020-11-06 04:28:23 +0800 <Camelback71> The evidence is Adrian Fontes.  That's all the evidence you need.
1324448241165889536 2020-11-06 04:27:22 +0800 <Camelback71> @dustopian I'm just grateful I got a good night sleep last night.  Turned off my phone.
1324447971287576576 2020-11-06 04:26:18 +0800 <Camelback71> @convectionary @kamyupdegraff @CocosPatient @newsmax Weeknights are okay on Newsmax.  Greg Kelly, Spicer and now Bannon is on.  The weekends, though, are, except for Michelle Malkin, Talking Points USA cringe.
1324446386146873344 2020-11-06 04:20:00 +0800 <Camelback71> It was 35,000 this morning.  The number just keeps growing.
1324446133272260610 2020-11-06 04:18:59 +0800 <Camelback71> Yes,  Katie, you're counting votes that should have been counted days ago.
1324427139320406016 2020-11-06 03:03:31 +0800 <Camelback71> The fact is a court order is only so good as an officer of the executive branch of a city, county or state chooses to enforce it.
1324426508622946304 2020-11-06 03:01:00 +0800 <Camelback71> Crenshaw's first tweet in 2 days.
1324426204326240256 2020-11-06 02:59:48 +0800 <Camelback71> I could number the rest of them on one hand.  The majority of the GOP establishment is busy moving on.
1324424243887529986 2020-11-06 02:52:01 +0800 <Camelback71> Sure you will tough guy.

1324423845567057921 2020-11-06 02:50:26 +0800 <Camelback71> @tonib Many of them have apartments and condos in Georgetown and off Massachusetts and Connecticut Avenues.
1324417533307334656 2020-11-06 02:25:21 +0800 <Camelback71> Next Thursday??
1324417374238380035 2020-11-06 02:24:43 +0800 <Camelback71> Transparency!
1324417202443857920 2020-11-06 02:24:02 +0800 <Camelback71> The Bulwark is already instituting a truth and reconciliation commission aimed at elected Republicans.
1324416243873452032 2020-11-06 02:20:13 +0800 <Camelback71> All LEGAL votes count.
1324416106593878016 2020-11-06 02:19:40 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, but most of these legislatures delegated their authority over elections to the executive branch agencies through legislation. They can pass new bills but they need their respective governors to sign it.
1324415527163371520 2020-11-06 02:17:22 +0800 <Camelback71> @blanarovich @GarretLewis Fontes encouraged Sharpies but at my early polling place in a diverse area of N. Phoenix only BALL point pens were on offer and used. Nobody there was using a Sharpie.
1324414747433865216 2020-11-06 02:14:16 +0800 <Camelback71> Remarkably high? More like unbelievably high.
1324406399703474178 2020-11-06 01:41:06 +0800 <Camelback71> He's right.
1324405679231102981 2020-11-06 01:38:14 +0800 <Camelback71> All LEGAL votes will be counted, right, @elviadiaz1?
1324401634743496704 2020-11-06 01:22:10 +0800 <Camelback71> I would suggest ACB not recuse herself on the incoming petition and repeal.
1324400788882427905 2020-11-06 01:18:48 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, throwing away one's vote is so principled!
1324398848555413504 2020-11-06 01:11:06 +0800 <Camelback71> Ah, yes, nothing like 90,000 new registered voters on election day in one Wisconsin county alone.
1324397147404464130 2020-11-06 01:04:20 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao. The Nevadan officials counting the votes aren't nonpartisan.
1324390130338029568 2020-11-06 00:36:27 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried They aren't being allowed in anyways.
1324389458725122049 2020-11-06 00:33:47 +0800 <Camelback71> Nobody is asking Katie here to stop counting.  They're asking her to hurry the f*** up.
1324386419117207553 2020-11-06 00:21:42 +0800 <Camelback71> Another House GOP "leader" who's been silent since Tuesday.  Not one word of support for Trump's efforts to fight the voter fraud going on in Michigan, PA and Georgia.
1324385835148402690 2020-11-06 00:19:23 +0800 <Camelback71> This fraud has gaslighted Trump voters for over a year.  Since Tuesday?  Not a peep.
1324385481698672641 2020-11-06 00:17:59 +0800 <Camelback71> Not one word in support of Trump since Tuesday night but he did find time to thank her.
1324384437035962368 2020-11-06 00:13:50 +0800 <Camelback71> This is all bullshit. All Biden needs, besides whatever dementia drugs he's on, is a phone and pen.
1324378904069500928 2020-11-05 23:51:51 +0800 <Camelback71> Lovely CYA.  Question: Have these peoples' votes been counted?  Have they Jen?  Why was a lawsuit filed?
1324377743719428098 2020-11-05 23:47:14 +0800 <Camelback71> Sweetheart, the GOP establishment is doing nothing to help Trump.  You should be happy with that.
1324377105954603010 2020-11-05 23:44:42 +0800 <Camelback71> They literally don't care about Trump - at all.  None of these bastards do.
1324353906105741313 2020-11-05 22:12:31 +0800 <Camelback71> All of this bullshit.
1324352830971392000 2020-11-05 22:08:14 +0800 <Camelback71> Penzone won't help ICE but he will send out his deputies to disperse Republican protestors.
1324351864041742336 2020-11-05 22:04:24 +0800 <Camelback71> Surprise, surprise!
1324351437887844354 2020-11-05 22:02:42 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao.
1324350763410190336 2020-11-05 22:00:01 +0800 <Camelback71> He lost? Apparently, Arizona needn't count the rest of the votes
1324345633440894977 2020-11-05 21:39:38 +0800 <Camelback71> Yes, Republicans need to cut off their nose to spite their face.
1324330977741533184 2020-11-05 20:41:24 +0800 <Camelback71> Bob Barr is already packing his bags. He's done his duty for deep state.
1324330502044614656 2020-11-05 20:39:31 +0800 <Camelback71> You're an idiot if you think this.
1324328437897592832 2020-11-05 20:31:19 +0800 <Camelback71> All summer long this prick has said nothing as Third World thugs and arsonists ravaged American cities and now he's upset because a bunch of patriots want to make sure votes are counted?
1324243066408951808 2020-11-05 14:52:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Dream on you neocon stooge.
1324242272246923265 2020-11-05 14:48:55 +0800 <Camelback71> This üëá
1324241227399659520 2020-11-05 14:44:46 +0800 <Camelback71> Democrat election officials are playing a game here. Fontes won't get all these votes counted till Philadelphia gets enough votes to give the state to Biden. It's that simple.
1324237364026245125 2020-11-05 14:29:25 +0800 <Camelback71> I'm going to guess you cheered on Antifa during the summer.
1324237139874230272 2020-11-05 14:28:31 +0800 <Camelback71> Who's being arrested, sweetheart?
1324237017115320320 2020-11-05 14:28:02 +0800 <Camelback71> Ensuring a legal and fair counting of the votes is "sowing doubts in our election"? Are you on crack?
1324235319185567744 2020-11-05 14:21:17 +0800 <Camelback71> @dennisjsaffran @SquarePegDem @nypmetro John James is no big loss. He would have simply been another neocon stooge who'd have jumped on board Tim Scott's repugnant police "reform" bill.
1324167672695721984 2020-11-05 09:52:29 +0800 <Camelback71> Thanks Captain Obvious. We've known this since 2016.
1324167109736243200 2020-11-05 09:50:15 +0800 <Camelback71> Flush these bastards down the toilet.
1324166768785436673 2020-11-05 09:48:54 +0800 <Camelback71> Fuck off.
1324166247383117824 2020-11-05 09:46:49 +0800 <Camelback71> Another Marco Rubio. No thanks.
1324134060365541377 2020-11-05 07:38:55 +0800 <Camelback71> Oh, they wrote a letter.
1324133499129880576 2020-11-05 07:36:42 +0800 <Camelback71> Hey a**hole, how bout speaking up about the fraud being perpetrated in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.  Nobody gives a shit about your powerless minority in the House.
1324126675920060417 2020-11-05 07:09:35 +0800 <Camelback71> Take this shit elsewhere, sweetheart.  Trump's been wronged here. Nobody is moving on.
1324120833934069760 2020-11-05 06:46:22 +0800 <Camelback71> Banana republic dictators always say this crap.
1324105936500215808 2020-11-05 05:47:10 +0800 <Camelback71> 23,277 to 0, Biden. 5,300 to 0, Biden. ...and 538 is reporting this with a straight face.
1324103681248161793 2020-11-05 05:38:12 +0800 <Camelback71> Why do you think?  Michigan has been called.  They're in the clear now.
1324103194385903618 2020-11-05 05:36:16 +0800 <Camelback71> Now that Michigan was called, of course they are.
1324102282619711488 2020-11-05 05:32:39 +0800 <Camelback71> @modernista64 @tired_fighting @EricaReportsAll @12News Hey moron, alot of folks are looking up their ballot on the AZ SoS and MCR websites and finding their ballots have been cancelled.  Try to keep up here.  And many early voting ballots weren't fed into machine by the voter.  They were done by the Recorder's staff later.
1324086703112421376 2020-11-05 04:30:45 +0800 <Camelback71> Someone tell @megynkelly.  She's under the impression the election is over.
1324085068902494208 2020-11-05 04:24:15 +0800 <Camelback71> Are you trying to get rehired?  This is straight up bullshit right now.
1324084577711738880 2020-11-05 04:22:18 +0800 <Camelback71> Count every vote... no matter how fraudulent.
1324084244918857730 2020-11-05 04:20:58 +0800 <Camelback71> Don't bet on it.
1324078049743179776 2020-11-05 03:56:21 +0800 <Camelback71> If you think these newly minted elected Republicans in the House and Senate are going to form some Trumpian resistance to the institutional GOP well, I have a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn.
1324077387986870272 2020-11-05 03:53:44 +0800 <Camelback71> John James will become a reliable stooge for the George W. Bush GOP donor class.  Bank on it.  He'll also play the race card along with Tim Scott on "police reform".
1324075854540894208 2020-11-05 03:47:38 +0800 <Camelback71> Fox News projects Biden steals battleground Wisconsin... there, I fixed it.
1324075052858400768 2020-11-05 03:44:27 +0800 <Camelback71> The George W. Bush House minority.
1324068781614772224 2020-11-05 03:19:32 +0800 <Camelback71> So, for the second straight election you were dead wrong. Ya, you're not the new Michael Barone.
1324066154898337792 2020-11-05 03:09:05 +0800 <Camelback71> They won't rescind it till Biden declares victory this evening.
1324063732465430529 2020-11-05 02:59:28 +0800 <Camelback71> Arizona has to stay in Biden's column so he can claim victory in 3 hours.  They can't chance a flip to Trump.
1324062184079417344 2020-11-05 02:53:19 +0800 <Camelback71> @Skyejohnson4 How does the vote for President have nearly 90,000-100,000 more votes than the Senate race in Michigan?
1324061987756670976 2020-11-05 02:52:32 +0800 <Camelback71> Should Arizona tip to Trump by dinner time expect Philadelphia to pick up the pace of counting the "mail-in ballots" outstanding.  The plan is to have Biden declare victory. With AZ out, PA has to come in.
1324056280730722308 2020-11-05 02:29:51 +0800 <Camelback71> It won't be a bright, shiny object in 2024. And they don't need to win a ton of counties, just urban areas.
1324054974045646854 2020-11-05 02:24:40 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao.
1324049595249303553 2020-11-05 02:03:17 +0800 <Camelback71> Chief correspondent for Pravda has a message from the lawyer for the General Secretary.
1324043693209214976 2020-11-05 01:39:50 +0800 <Camelback71> This is turning out not to be the case. And no Sharpies were on offer at the N. Phoenix early voting center I went to 10 days ago. The location offered ball point black pens.
1324042602161688577 2020-11-05 01:35:30 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao.
1324041161489567744 2020-11-05 01:29:47 +0800 <Camelback71> Please post a link to this 10,000 vote figure.
1324040923781591040 2020-11-05 01:28:50 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist W Bush Republicans...
1324039862006112256 2020-11-05 01:24:37 +0800 <Camelback71> It looks like if you voted early (R or D), your vote was counted.  No pens on offer at the polling site I went to were Sharpies. None.  This makes sense.  The Democrats knew that Republicans were going to blow away Democrats on Election Day voting.  Lo and behold, the Sharpie!
1324037994987294721 2020-11-05 01:17:12 +0800 <Camelback71> One mail-in batch had a Biden spread of 183,000 to zero.  You were saying?
1324036284415795200 2020-11-05 01:10:24 +0800 <Camelback71> Thread üëá
1324034973410619393 2020-11-05 01:05:11 +0800 <Camelback71> You better believe it.
1324034720435351552 2020-11-05 01:04:11 +0800 <Camelback71> Bring it.
1324034598615937024 2020-11-05 01:03:42 +0800 <Camelback71> @MelLynnAz Over 500,000 to a million new registered voters on election day?
1324034274098470913 2020-11-05 01:02:24 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin Not to blackpill at this hour but many of these "new" Republicans aren't Trump Republicans.  They're W Bush Republicans.  Especially in the Senate.  These folks are still beholden to a donor class that is staunchly against Trumpian populism.
1324032196349292544 2020-11-05 00:54:09 +0800 <Camelback71> These margins are simply not realistic.
1324031615396315136 2020-11-05 00:51:51 +0800 <Camelback71> With more votes counted than registered voters?  Ya, that's going to court.
1324030984027688960 2020-11-05 00:49:20 +0800 <Camelback71> The mainstream media is running with the narrative that will lead up to Biden's speech tonight claiming victory.  The entire thing has been planned from day one.
1324016057774862337 2020-11-04 23:50:01 +0800 <Camelback71> Deace will never be white pilled but it looks like he's overdosing on every other dissident prescription drug.
1324015048725995521 2020-11-04 23:46:01 +0800 <Camelback71> It's one county. The country's foreign born population and especially the second generation vote blue. Stop this nonsense.
1324005045252222978 2020-11-04 23:06:16 +0800 <Camelback71> This isn't an excuse.
1324000961774317577 2020-11-04 22:50:02 +0800 <Camelback71> Barf.
1323992413220741124 2020-11-04 22:16:04 +0800 <Camelback71> More tax cuts for big tech!
1323987166196760576 2020-11-04 21:55:13 +0800 <Camelback71> We don't live in a democracy. We live in a republic, a banana republic.
1323986127737430017 2020-11-04 21:51:05 +0800 <Camelback71> Among the normiest of normie Cons just went there.
1323985240004571137 2020-11-04 21:47:34 +0800 <Camelback71> Shut up, you voted for Biden.
1323984986765062145 2020-11-04 21:46:33 +0800 <Camelback71> So much for Blexit.
1323983929754357760 2020-11-04 21:42:21 +0800 <Camelback71> What the f*** is going on in Maricopa? Fontes is a disgrace.
1323983226759569410 2020-11-04 21:39:34 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao
1323962100264312833 2020-11-04 20:15:37 +0800 <Camelback71> That's if they weren't filled out by Sharpie pens.
1323870055780679680 2020-11-04 14:09:52 +0800 <Camelback71> Fuck off. That's not even close to the truth!
1323869463855333377 2020-11-04 14:07:31 +0800 <Camelback71> @oblivious_guy Yup
1323868323830919172 2020-11-04 14:02:59 +0800 <Camelback71> Philly isn't in yet. They're waiting to find out how many votes they'll need.
1323867894061543425 2020-11-04 14:01:16 +0800 <Camelback71> Blexit, not so much.
1323867650175348736 2020-11-04 14:00:18 +0800 <Camelback71> Guy pulls a classic move straight out of a banana republic coup and you're praising him? Lmao
1323867361099706368 2020-11-04 13:59:09 +0800 <Camelback71> Good God.
1323866995981381634 2020-11-04 13:57:42 +0800 <Camelback71> Is Milwaukee in?
1323866291606712320 2020-11-04 13:54:54 +0800 <Camelback71> I believe you are right but Atlanta's vote is still to be counted with Trump up 300k.
1323863722301878274 2020-11-04 13:44:42 +0800 <Camelback71> @Shabbosgoy Nate Cohn mentions it in his Twitter feed.
1323863142342959104 2020-11-04 13:42:23 +0800 <Camelback71> Atlanta hasn't been counted.
1323862163958583296 2020-11-04 13:38:30 +0800 <Camelback71> @oblivious_guy The California stuff is nonsense. It's the unending legal immigration from Mexico that's turning the State blue. And McCain Republicans are Democrats at this point.
1323859485178302468 2020-11-04 13:27:52 +0800 <Camelback71> Trump, unfortunately, is getting his just desserts here. Letting Paul Ryan hijack his 2016 agenda and tank his immigration policy only got him this from Ryan in return.
1323848938735034376 2020-11-04 12:45:57 +0800 <Camelback71> Chris Stirewalt is embarrassing himself on Fox. Ohio should be called for Trump.
1323848155981475840 2020-11-04 12:42:50 +0800 <Camelback71> So true.
1323845539733991426 2020-11-04 12:32:27 +0800 <Camelback71> Barf.  https://t.co/LqwubzCSkH
1323843797709545473 2020-11-04 12:25:31 +0800 <Camelback71> Fox News just called AZ for Biden. Barf.
1323834726956756992 2020-11-04 11:49:29 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist @ClayTravis They always fail ...upward.
1323783171788345344 2020-11-04 08:24:37 +0800 <Camelback71> It probably doesn't include the returns from all or any combination of Loudon, Prince William, Arlington, Alexandria and Fairfax counties.  These are the northern Virginia counties that range from deep blue to tip blue now in 2020.
1323779993512505345 2020-11-04 08:11:59 +0800 <Camelback71> That's Fort Worth and surrounding suburbs for you folks in Rio Lindo.
1323744123342397446 2020-11-04 05:49:27 +0800 <Camelback71> @MotherRobinson3 @Barnes_Law @Peoples_Pundit @JasonMillerinDC @NicholasTrainer @BillStepien @GOPChairwoman @kelliwardaz @garrettlewis.... ???
1323743623519723520 2020-11-04 05:47:28 +0800 <Camelback71> @MotherRobinson3 @Barnes_Law @Peoples_Pundit @JasonMillerinDC @NicholasTrainer @BillStepien I'm using the official numbers albeit posted by the enemy.  It's a beautiful day here in Phoenix and across the state so there's no excuse for Republicans not voting here.
1323742775108542466 2020-11-04 05:44:06 +0800 <Camelback71> The late day work crowd will start voting in two hours but as I feared, Republicans may have cannibalized their election day voting with heavy early voting.  May have never had the numbers to catch up on Election Day.
1323731595283427328 2020-11-04 04:59:40 +0800 <Camelback71> @MooksInsight Actually, they have to break at least 30% for Trump if he intends to win states like North Carolina, Georgia and Pennsylvania.  Are they?
1323731158274772992 2020-11-04 04:57:56 +0800 <Camelback71> The question what's the vote split for "Other".
1323729625948721152 2020-11-04 04:51:51 +0800 <Camelback71> This üëá  Stay positive but be aware this now appears to be the ball game.
1323718451777527808 2020-11-04 04:07:27 +0800 <Camelback71> @Shannonagain2 Gen Xers were still raw enough Heritage Americans to resist the leftward lurch of academia and know of an America that confronted race but wasn't guilted into turning it into the mess it is today.
1323717694756024320 2020-11-04 04:04:26 +0800 <Camelback71> @VACountryBoy94 @SteveDeaceShow An entire county's voting machines in GA went down for hours this morning.  That county was carried by Trump +24 in 2016.
1323714103387463681 2020-11-04 03:50:10 +0800 <Camelback71> Kind of hard to vote when the machines are shut down.  #SpaldingCountyGA
1323706034180005890 2020-11-04 03:18:06 +0800 <Camelback71> So the Trump campaign wasn't prepared to stop Biden from stealing PA? That is what you're saying.
1323701185627320321 2020-11-04 02:58:50 +0800 <Camelback71> The question is how much of the Independent vote is going Trump?
1323695200112271360 2020-11-04 02:35:03 +0800 <Camelback71> 538 is now talking about election lawfare, not the election.

1323688850925920256 2020-11-04 02:09:49 +0800 <Camelback71> @Shannonagain2 Heavy Democrat area I believe. Although the map has it voting plus Republican as of this morning.
1323685937230962688 2020-11-04 01:58:14 +0800 <Camelback71> @Shannonagain2 What part of Mesa? East or West?
1323683541314514946 2020-11-04 01:48:43 +0800 <Camelback71> I want to see this smug, holier-than-thou prick cry tonight.
1323679393911250946 2020-11-04 01:32:14 +0800 <Camelback71> They aren't cases.  They're positive tests. There is a difference
1323678847515074562 2020-11-04 01:30:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Well, Nevada's Democrat authorities need to stop shutting down voting precincts.
1323676616053043200 2020-11-04 01:21:12 +0800 <Camelback71> So far today Trump voting precincts and areas have been shut down or broken down in Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Nevada.
1323665366262796289 2020-11-04 00:36:30 +0800 <Camelback71> @kaiser36287482 @WarioMaker @CottoGottfried That's been my experience.  It's legal immigration that's tipped the scales here in the state.  But nobody wants to admit it; they want to blame blue state immigration.  It's nonsense.
1323665126885453826 2020-11-04 00:35:33 +0800 <Camelback71> Democrats:  You must count every vote that is CAST.  Republican precinct breaks down:  Democrats:  You can't count every vote when they're not cast.
1323664661162516480 2020-11-04 00:33:42 +0800 <Camelback71> @kaiser36287482 @WarioMaker @CottoGottfried Maricopa is 50/50 at this point.  The Glendale, central Phoenix and Tempe areas have seen incredible jumps in Democrat voting that now evens up the Scottsdale, Peoria, and Chandler voting numbers. Demographics matter, Californians moving here less so.
1323664171481788417 2020-11-04 00:31:45 +0800 <Camelback71> @kaiser36287482 @WarioMaker @CottoGottfried I live here.  I know.  And I know that turnout has been high in the early hours in Maricopa.  The question is how much of a spread do the Republicans have right now?  They always win election day in Maricopa but is it enough to overcome the Dem early vote lead.
1323660340236726272 2020-11-04 00:16:32 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried Where are they getting these numbers?
1323660184732925952 2020-11-04 00:15:55 +0800 <Camelback71> Tell me this isn't suspicious.
1323655562207244288 2020-11-03 23:57:33 +0800 <Camelback71> The GOP early voting doesn't seem to have cannibalized the Republican vote on election day in Florida.  Question is:  Will the GOP vote today in Arizona, Pennsylvania and North Carolina follow suit?
1323654833254006785 2020-11-03 23:54:39 +0800 <Camelback71> Following the Bulwark offers so much comedy gold.
1323653501382062080 2020-11-03 23:49:21 +0800 <Camelback71> @MelLynnAz @blanarovich Let's hope these reports of "no lines" doesn't mean Republicans have cannibalized their election day voting by voting early.  That's the big question for the day.  GOP usually wins election day voting.  The question is by how much today?

1323442494680387584 2020-11-03 09:50:53 +0800 <Camelback71> The Electoral College is racist because the bulk of third world legal immigrants since 1965 decided to settle in coastal states?

1323382703744446464 2020-11-03 05:53:18 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried There was hardly anything good that came from the social revolution of the 1960s.  Sorry. But it is true that the two driving factors of the divide in American society are immigration and the failure of assimilation and the rot of the 1960s that infected higher education.
1323381932923650049 2020-11-03 05:50:14 +0800 <Camelback71> Reagan did not "unite us".  The 1980s included the San Francisco Democrats, a Borking, and 50% of the country hoping the Soviet Union would win the Cold War.
1323379673145901056 2020-11-03 05:41:15 +0800 <Camelback71> Supposed "conservatives" certainly are blind and stupid.

1323367372212695041 2020-11-03 04:52:23 +0800 <Camelback71> So what you're say is he should have left you to rot in that prison? Got it.

1323351744525475840 2020-11-03 03:50:17 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried Early voting spread is 56-42% for Biden; election day R-D spread is 66-26% Republicans.
1323350751918223360 2020-11-03 03:46:20 +0800 <Camelback71> The media is getting "instructions" from the USA Today and it's affiliated newspapers.

Maybe but from the looks of their voting in 2018, their  overrepresentation in organizations like Antifa and their predicted voting behavior in 2020, I'm not so sure.  They'd rather virtue signal their wokeness than acknowledge such hard truths publicly.

1323337779137318912 2020-11-03 02:54:47 +0800 <Camelback71> The problem for the GOP is white college educated men, the pajama boy demographic.  The GOP is never going to win the black and hispanic voting blocs, especially with the latter being reinforced with unending legal immigration.

1322564876057735168 2020-10-31 23:43:33 +0800 <Camelback71> @CodyLSmallwood They've got so many conspiracy theories I can't keep up.
1322564639293542400 2020-10-31 23:42:36 +0800 <Camelback71> Based on crack!
1322544682337906689 2020-10-31 22:23:18 +0800 <Camelback71> The only folks inciting violence in the streets is Antifa you dim fucking bulb.
1322544307090329601 2020-10-31 22:21:49 +0800 <Camelback71> Oh God, not the Third Reich...
1322543344514338818 2020-10-31 22:17:59 +0800 <Camelback71> Only one actor could play Indy's pop. Only one.  https://t.co/6CRgjLlOqM
1322539826755760129 2020-10-31 22:04:00 +0800 <Camelback71> 2020 is by far the shittiest year of my life.
1322539208444014592 2020-10-31 22:01:33 +0800 <Camelback71> @NightmarEclipse I'm sure will hear that empty headed talker Mark Davis four years from now telling us once again that Texas will never go blue.
1322538858571915264 2020-10-31 22:00:10 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist Am I really supposed to live with these people?
1322381985398972416 2020-10-31 11:36:48 +0800 <Camelback71> @NNJ_Taxman @tonib @ScottTBrower1 He's going to see his buddy Gillum.
1322309630043680769 2020-10-31 06:49:17 +0800 <Camelback71> @BringBackPapa @RyanGirdusky Ya, she's that bad. In fact, worse.
1322301521879429120 2020-10-31 06:17:04 +0800 <Camelback71> This isn't groundbreaking news.  Trump was always going to lose the Latino vote.  The question is: By how much?
1322301084283461633 2020-10-31 06:15:20 +0800 <Camelback71> It's utopian nonsense in the age of unending legal immigration.
1322300884001251328 2020-10-31 06:14:32 +0800 <Camelback71> Structural pluralism has been the norm in America; unending legal immigration has not.  You can't have that shared upon and revered national narrative when foreigners swamp and drown out that narrative.  And that narrative isn't simply a few ideas from the Declaration.
1322300027948081152 2020-10-31 06:11:08 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, no country works on that nonsense for long.  You can't simply choose different items from the national symbolic menu.  You're either all in on the nation you choose or not.
1322289269323390976 2020-10-31 05:28:23 +0800 <Camelback71> But you've repeatedly told America that to "shut down the virus" you have shut down the country and the economy.
1322231370102562819 2020-10-31 01:38:19 +0800 <Camelback71> @zones2surf She's a dim bulb.  A trust fund girl from Santa Monica.
1322230357085704194 2020-10-31 01:34:17 +0800 <Camelback71> Masks don't work.  And unless you have symptoms (in which case you should be home), you don't have socially distance from anyone.
1322229839890280449 2020-10-31 01:32:14 +0800 <Camelback71> Nonsense. Demographics is destiny, sweetie.
1322223325565759488 2020-10-31 01:06:21 +0800 <Camelback71> Buchanan was never an extremist kook. Only to a clownish pinko like yourself. And Krauthammer, like so many other neocons, used the GOP as a vehicle to  further Israel's interests.
1322217019794583553 2020-10-31 00:41:17 +0800 <Camelback71> Why are they even polling Florida at this point?  This is laugable. Most know the score there with early voting.
1322214913197010944 2020-10-31 00:32:55 +0800 <Camelback71> Yes, sweetheart, they always have been cosmopolitan liberals. Pat Buchanan is and always was a conservative.  Those two never were.
1322214484291694593 2020-10-31 00:31:13 +0800 <Camelback71> There's panic porn and then there's this.   1004 people didn't die "yesterday" "from" Covid.  And the virus is not 10 times more deadly than the flu.
1322213480888328193 2020-10-31 00:27:14 +0800 <Camelback71> They were never "GOP" military generals and thought leaders.  The military brass was de facto Republican because the party consistently favored the wars it wanted.  The "thought leaders" were cosmopolitan liberals collecting a paycheck.  Open your eyes.
1322183372613902339 2020-10-30 22:27:35 +0800 <Camelback71> There are no "middle of the road" Democrats."
1322182951732305925 2020-10-30 22:25:55 +0800 <Camelback71> Cases, er positive tests, are not deaths.
1322182183973396480 2020-10-30 22:22:52 +0800 <Camelback71> I'm sure he'll do the former. The latter? I doubt it.
1322180615375003648 2020-10-30 22:16:38 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos I wish the right was.
1322156265976418304 2020-10-30 20:39:52 +0800 <Camelback71> Republicans voting for Biden aren't Republicans. They're mentally ill Democrats.
1322153263400017923 2020-10-30 20:27:57 +0800 <Camelback71> It's too bad this "64-page document" didn't have magical powers. It could have made Hunter's laptop disappear.
1322044983369625600 2020-10-30 13:17:41 +0800 <Camelback71> @_danielleW___ Ya, it does. Try checking out the CDC stats.
1322043975230840832 2020-10-30 13:13:40 +0800 <Camelback71> CNN is a news network. üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
1322042917150576641 2020-10-30 13:09:28 +0800 <Camelback71> Jake's been counting flu deaths since the 1st grade apparently.
1321983199765880832 2020-10-30 09:12:10 +0800 <Camelback71> After numerous domestic abusers and assaults this is the guy you really despise and want to otherize forever?
1321980789228150784 2020-10-30 09:02:36 +0800 <Camelback71> "They‚Äôre trying to protect a notion of America‚Äôs identity as a mainly white country." Well yeah, it's called assimilation.
1321979899385585664 2020-10-30 08:59:03 +0800 <Camelback71> Is this your kid, Mr. Coyote?
1321978741317230592 2020-10-30 08:54:27 +0800 <Camelback71> Apparently rules mean nothing to these people. If they had their way, they'd count till Christmas to make sure Biden won.
1321932470531452928 2020-10-30 05:50:35 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin The big deal is the Department dragging their feet on this investigation.  It's October of 2020.
1321926536983818241 2020-10-30 05:27:01 +0800 <Camelback71> @VDAREJamesK White pill!!
1321926372156043264 2020-10-30 05:26:21 +0800 <Camelback71> Oh no! The sky is falling!
1321926241960697856 2020-10-30 05:25:50 +0800 <Camelback71> Well, maybe this one does: The virus has a survival rate of 99%.
1321926016672034816 2020-10-30 05:24:57 +0800 <Camelback71> "Dangerous point" ...
1321925923826888704 2020-10-30 05:24:35 +0800 <Camelback71> The survival rate is 99%. Why are you still kvetching?
1321904022207356933 2020-10-30 03:57:33 +0800 <Camelback71> @tonib ...tampered with.
1321902906287689729 2020-10-30 03:53:07 +0800 <Camelback71> @NNJ_Taxman I think the surprises are Nevada and Michigan.  I think both are going to Trump. Wisconsin remains a toss up, Minnesota is gone and PA will be a voter fraud paradise.
1321886289310883843 2020-10-30 02:47:05 +0800 <Camelback71> Well, considering she only welcomed his endorsement when it became painfully clear she wasn't gaining any traction against Kelly, do you blame him?
1321876032421457920 2020-10-30 02:06:20 +0800 <Camelback71> @kc2fargo @cruadin Quite frankly, he's not a conservative. He's nothing more than Kirsten Powers with a goofy grin and beard. A holier than though leftist who's parading around asxa conservative to get a paycheck and clicks
1321873565004648449 2020-10-30 01:56:31 +0800 <Camelback71> "Masks are not merely a small inconvenience. They have inadvertently become a key impediment to returning to a more normal life, a desirable goal for those seeking to twist the pandemic for political and electoral purposes."  https://t.co/hk8OIUVfnk
1321871464304267264 2020-10-30 01:48:10 +0800 <Camelback71> @VDAREJamesK Sad fact: Such proposals are for gaslighting, not for actual implementation.
1321870006070636546 2020-10-30 01:42:23 +0800 <Camelback71> Apparently, elections shouldn't have any rules according this prick.
1321869753124745216 2020-10-30 01:41:22 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist I have to hand it to some liberals, especially the smart asses. They know the Biden corruption is grotesque but they're ever grateful nobody in legacy media is touching it.
1321825966746865666 2020-10-29 22:47:23 +0800 <Camelback71> It's not a minor inconvenience.  It's a control mechanism.  Someone with a supposed high IQ would know this.
1321825731001819137 2020-10-29 22:46:27 +0800 <Camelback71> Of course he didn't.  He's a "super genius". Lmao.
1321815571747409927 2020-10-29 22:06:05 +0800 <Camelback71> @vetsandfriends Oh, I know it, but the problem I have is with conservatives, like at Townhall, tooting the horns of these useless ticks.
1321813553926479872 2020-10-29 21:58:04 +0800 <Camelback71> @nifty_john No, he doesn't.  He has Thomas and Alito.  That's it. It's time conservatives stop believing many of these Federalist Society judges are Clarence Thomas'.  They're not.
1321813248551780353 2020-10-29 21:56:51 +0800 <Camelback71> Who wants to bet she favors another lockdown and national mask mandate?
1321800285459632129 2020-10-29 21:05:20 +0800 <Camelback71> It's too bad half the country has the voted already.
1321794674923724801 2020-10-29 20:43:02 +0800 <Camelback71> "Divisive". If he endorsed Biden, you'd be calling him courageous.
1321793619724914688 2020-10-29 20:38:51 +0800 <Camelback71> They're not new cases. They're positive tests. In order to determine case numbers you need to know how many are symptomatic.
1321792925093617664 2020-10-29 20:36:05 +0800 <Camelback71> Try 2...
1321792600815235072 2020-10-29 20:34:48 +0800 <Camelback71> I'm not sure the media can blame white supremacists for this. But they'll try.

1321671636773302272 2020-10-29 12:34:08 +0800 <Camelback71> Please stop with this nonsense.
1321671477410766849 2020-10-29 12:33:30 +0800 <Camelback71> Pollster is upset about news organization reporting on actual, you know, vote counts.
1321671130537631744 2020-10-29 12:32:07 +0800 <Camelback71> This isn't a big step toward fixing H1bs.  Fixing it would entail enacting a moratorium on them.

I'm still predicting a close Trump win but it's gonna be extremely close.

1321649427069640707 2020-10-29 11:05:53 +0800 <Camelback71> The revolution will be televised and there's nothing the right can do about it.
1321584239087775744 2020-10-29 06:46:51 +0800 <Camelback71> There won't be a fight if ACB continues to recuse herself.
1321583239845195776 2020-10-29 06:42:52 +0800 <Camelback71> Pathetic opening act for ACB.  You can bet your ass RBG would have never have recused herself.
1321568767369863168 2020-10-29 05:45:22 +0800 <Camelback71> CNN can have it both ways.  None of CNN's peers in the news business is going to hold them accountable outside of a few virtue signalling tweets everybody will forget in a week.
1321563266217226240 2020-10-29 05:23:30 +0800 <Camelback71> Right wing Twitter in 2020 is basically reduced to bitching, moaning and gaslighting.
1321562522663624704 2020-10-29 05:20:33 +0800 <Camelback71> No, they really don't.  The powers that be won't do anything about it.
1321561822785232896 2020-10-29 05:17:46 +0800 <Camelback71> She should know.
1321542624201695232 2020-10-29 04:01:29 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried Of course, there's way too many families who have seen what private health care can cost over the last 20 years and such costs are why a groundswell is now on the surface for nationalized health care.
1321540235516203008 2020-10-29 03:51:59 +0800 <Camelback71> So a snake in the grass, open borders stooge is the mystery Trump critic. Yawn.
1321539222608596993 2020-10-29 03:47:58 +0800 <Camelback71> Problem is, things aren't going to back to normal with Biden winning. They only get worse.
1321534330951225344 2020-10-29 03:28:32 +0800 <Camelback71> When I think of decency I think of enabling a crackhead son, inappropriately touching young girls, and selling out America in exchange for million dollar payoffs from foreign oligarchs, spy masters and dictators.
1321533354097823744 2020-10-29 03:24:39 +0800 <Camelback71> They'll pretend because there's no repercussions for doing so.
1321529581824733185 2020-10-29 03:09:39 +0800 <Camelback71> Masks don't work anyways regardless if they "don't wear it right".
1321520142166020096 2020-10-29 02:32:09 +0800 <Camelback71> Too bad no one outside the conservative ghetto will hear it.
1321519826393681920 2020-10-29 02:30:53 +0800 <Camelback71> @BillySa58141904 You're much more optimistic than I am.  I think the Asians are lost.  Latinos have a better chance but the legal immigration spigot has to be turned. If it isn't, America, as we know it, grew up in it is gone forever.
1321519436151488513 2020-10-29 02:29:20 +0800 <Camelback71> Yup.  Atlanta and its growing suburbs, which includes AWFLS and affluent blacks are seeing to that.
1321517178793857025 2020-10-29 02:20:22 +0800 <Camelback71> Well, is Barr going to bring charges?  Nope.  Either do something about it or shut the fuck up. You're gaslighting is getting nauseating.

1321443866805850113 2020-10-28 21:29:03 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, let's continue an abundance of caution for a virus that has a 99% survival rate.
1321442307804069889 2020-10-28 21:22:52 +0800 <Camelback71> 99.9% of reporters are ignoring it. It won't matter because 60% of the electorate isn't even aware it.

1321309239457923072 2020-10-28 12:34:06 +0800 <Camelback71> Too many actual journalists think the mainstream media and legacy newspapers give one damn about journalism at this point.

1321267455793098752 2020-10-28 09:48:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Without a mainstream outlet outside Tucker, it won't matter. The story gets no traction unless a mainstream outlet gives it legs.

1321228609089015808 2020-10-28 07:13:42 +0800 <Camelback71> @zones2surf Fontes, no doubt, will be up to all sorts of fraudulent activity, in the days after November 3.
1321228388942499840 2020-10-28 07:12:49 +0800 <Camelback71> @NNJ_Taxman We're going to have weed out the wheat from the chaff after this election regardless of a Trump victory.  It's becoming increasingly clear outside of Trump the majority of those representing actual GOP voters have no interest in their issues or agenda.
1321212551334481921 2020-10-28 06:09:53 +0800 <Camelback71> Keep in mind Zuckerberg simply wants his terms of service and censorship rules written into law. He's not looking to have his site or any other social media site function as a true public square with unlimited free speech.

1321075985484181504 2020-10-27 21:07:14 +0800 <Camelback71> Gorsuch voted to review the PA law with T, A and K. Roberts voted with his liberal colleagues. It can be refiled but only in the next SC term.
1321075174918139906 2020-10-27 21:04:00 +0800 <Camelback71> Can this be deducted from the bill when America gets stuck paying reparations?

1320911183281491968 2020-10-27 10:12:22 +0800 <Camelback71> You're shitty little anti-Trump rag is bankrolled by well-heeled Democrats and somehow you're not in it for the grift?
1320902385766551554 2020-10-27 09:37:24 +0800 <Camelback71> This is why Democrats hate originalism.
1320902033969348608 2020-10-27 09:36:00 +0800 <Camelback71> Originalism isn't the outcome you'd prefer. Got it.
1320895718790361088 2020-10-27 09:10:55 +0800 <Camelback71> @NBurdens Oh yeah ...
1320891477958905856 2020-10-27 08:54:03 +0800 <Camelback71> @NBurdens With Bork there is no homosexual jurisprudence throughout the 90s and early 2000s. And consequently, no gay marriage "right".
1320888420671967235 2020-10-27 08:41:55 +0800 <Camelback71> No, we don't. At best it's 5-4 but Gorsuch has not been reliably conservative and Kavanaugh has given hints he's no Clarence Thomas.
1320887859759378432 2020-10-27 08:39:41 +0800 <Camelback71> Thanks, you've been a zero on everything else during these last four years.
1320881221895741440 2020-10-27 08:13:18 +0800 <Camelback71> Actually, it's 5-4, if that.  Roberts isn't a conservative.  Gorsuch is showing signs of evolving and if Kavanaugh's separate opinions are any indication, he might end up a Kennedy as well.
1320880511858798592 2020-10-27 08:10:29 +0800 <Camelback71> @NNJ_Taxman @BRyvkin It also doesn't guarantee anything if he pulls off Minnesota.
1320862835937701888 2020-10-27 07:00:15 +0800 <Camelback71> @SoothingDave @varadmehta @SethAMandel @Neoavatara He's not a conservative.  None of these NRO, Examiner contributors are.  NRO used to be staffed by Buchanan, Brimelow, O'Sullivan, Rusher, Derbyshire, Coulter.  They're conservatives. Those days are long past.
1320862241286098944 2020-10-27 06:57:53 +0800 <Camelback71> More honest headline: "Let's face it, I'm a cosmopolitan liberal, not a conservative. I'm not voting for Trump."
1320850279189811200 2020-10-27 06:10:21 +0800 <Camelback71> The biggest obstacle to Trump in Arizona is weed is on the ballot.

1320809876470198272 2020-10-27 03:29:48 +0800 <Camelback71> In this instance, of course, "keeping the Supreme Court out of politics" means endorsing what the Left wants.

1320765781550927872 2020-10-27 00:34:35 +0800 <Camelback71> @VDAREJamesK Outside the actual campaigns, the entire electorate appears to live in two different worlds. Outside a few curmudgeons, present company included, each thinks their candidate is going to win, and in some cases, win big.
1320765186215563266 2020-10-27 00:32:13 +0800 <Camelback71> The Founders did think the Constitution could change and incorporated a mechanism for such change. Originalism encompasses the whole of the Constitution, including its Amendments.

1320748733085052928 2020-10-26 23:26:50 +0800 <Camelback71> @HeritageAmeric6 He's making a calculated bet that Trump has annoyed enough wine aunts, cat ladies, suburban mothers and 20 and 30-something indoctrinated college students to carry him in the swing states.

1320624491861426182 2020-10-26 15:13:09 +0800 <Camelback71> Nonsense. One, most countries are not counting deaths like we are. The number of actual deaths FROM the virus is much lower. And we are testing ourselves to death.
1320568339110850561 2020-10-26 11:30:01 +0800 <Camelback71> Yes, let's compare the sole outlier in the world with respect to the virus. A homogeneous country that borders one country and is all but sealocked.

1320015931544797185 2020-10-24 22:54:57 +0800 <Camelback71> How many of those cases are in the hospital? In an ICU bed? That's what matters, not case numbers.

1320014609261105153 2020-10-24 22:49:42 +0800 <Camelback71> The median age of death for the virus is 78. The average age of death in the US, I believe, is 75.
1319923275749732352 2020-10-24 16:46:46 +0800 <Camelback71> Anarchists have now been twisted by law enforcement and the media into a "far right" group.

1319745317982539776 2020-10-24 04:59:38 +0800 <Camelback71> All throughout the 1980s, you fought President Reagan's policies that brought down the Soviet Union, but please go on.
1319744713163894784 2020-10-24 04:57:13 +0800 <Camelback71> Co-related is not causal, you clown.. That's not why cases, deaths and hospitalizations went down in Arizona.  The virus ran its course, like it did in Florida, Texas and other places during the summer. Much of what we see in the State now is your self-induced casedemic.
1319742196547907584 2020-10-24 04:47:13 +0800 <Camelback71> This is nonsense.  Your response to the pandemic has hardly included common sense.  You've destroyed plenty of small businesses with your draconian shutdown orders of July and September. The mask mandates were completely unnecessary.
1319732109905334273 2020-10-24 04:07:09 +0800 <Camelback71> India is filthy and why should Indian Americans care?  It's not their country anymore.
1319725693396111360 2020-10-24 03:41:39 +0800 <Camelback71> The "fact checkers" have Joe's back.  https://t.co/yzDIhJMZQA  https://t.co/xmTzdfEb28
1319725411031339008 2020-10-24 03:40:31 +0800 <Camelback71> She may lose the SRCC cash but Alaska isn't your normal red state.
1319723219905961986 2020-10-24 03:31:49 +0800 <Camelback71> Why are we wading into that conflict at all? @VDAREJamesK
1319721726821888000 2020-10-24 03:25:53 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin The next step would be to get Israel off the US taxpayer teat.  We can be there ally but I'm sick of my country being their benefactor.
1319721376240922624 2020-10-24 03:24:29 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin Driving a wedge between functioning Arab states and the dysfunctional PA was always there for an administration to run with it.  But the Swamp was too wedded to the idea of the pipe dream that was the "two-state solution".
1319710541116420098 2020-10-24 02:41:26 +0800 <Camelback71> None of these people were ever conservative in the first place.
1319710138933018625 2020-10-24 02:39:50 +0800 <Camelback71> PA Supreme Court to Democrats: Cheat any which way you can!
1319709360554082304 2020-10-24 02:36:45 +0800 <Camelback71> The Bulwark crowd is trying to whitewash the utter failure of "conservatism", their "conservatism", and blame it on Trump.
1319700073899409408 2020-10-24 01:59:51 +0800 <Camelback71> All deals outside the occasional unconditional surrender are cynical and transactional.
1319699731396714499 2020-10-24 01:58:29 +0800 <Camelback71> At this rate, most Brits are going to wish the Danes had won over eleven hundred years ago.
1319698640508579840 2020-10-24 01:54:09 +0800 <Camelback71> In less than 24 hours he's become a lobbyist for Exxon.  LoL.
1319688854740160513 2020-10-24 01:15:16 +0800 <Camelback71> F*** these people.
1319679211569876997 2020-10-24 00:36:57 +0800 <Camelback71> @end_isnear I'm partial to tavern wench.
1319678480771055618 2020-10-24 00:34:02 +0800 <Camelback71> @JimDelRey Truth be told, a Bugs Bunny cartoon is the level of their intelligence on most issues.
1319673342564077569 2020-10-24 00:13:37 +0800 <Camelback71> @MrIgnite4 They dropped the retard classes.
1319673179330146305 2020-10-24 00:12:58 +0800 <Camelback71> @VDAREJamesK 31 million new American valedictorians, I'm sure.
1319672363244347392 2020-10-24 00:09:44 +0800 <Camelback71> The United States isn't much different.
1319670362058018816 2020-10-24 00:01:47 +0800 <Camelback71> Joe Biden:  Trust the medical experts.  (Pro tip:  Italy's case numbers are going through the roof again)
1319669968087101441 2020-10-24 00:00:13 +0800 <Camelback71> The free market works when you have a high trust factor.
1319669283031449600 2020-10-23 23:57:30 +0800 <Camelback71> When does it end, Ducifer? We have a casedemic, not a pandemic.
1319669023676583936 2020-10-23 23:56:28 +0800 <Camelback71> Is it?  Sounds like a perjury trap to me.
1319668844823080961 2020-10-23 23:55:45 +0800 <Camelback71> So, Redskins fans will be in the stands. Got it.
1319649580665827328 2020-10-23 22:39:12 +0800 <Camelback71> Unicorncare.
1319649016280301568 2020-10-23 22:36:58 +0800 <Camelback71> She made her money playing a conservative on TV. Now, she's just an uglier version of Bill Kristol.
1319647667366940680 2020-10-23 22:31:36 +0800 <Camelback71> He's shutting down alot of things this morning.
1319647113567899653 2020-10-23 22:29:24 +0800 <Camelback71> Ah, LBJ did the most to replace the black father with a welfare check.
1319633418108366848 2020-10-23 21:34:59 +0800 <Camelback71> @ScottMGreer You can play Paul Ryan all you want, the left will still find evidence you're Hitler.
1319629667033202688 2020-10-23 21:20:04 +0800 <Camelback71> America's Best and Brightest here.
1319628083918295040 2020-10-23 21:13:47 +0800 <Camelback71> Good grief.
1319625452411965442 2020-10-23 21:03:19 +0800 <Camelback71> He gave the Squad and their Marxist sycophants raw red meat. He gave the rest of America the clearest reason to vote for the President.
1319517003061678081 2020-10-23 13:52:23 +0800 <Camelback71> This presidential historian has lived long enough to see himself become a laughingstock.
1319516491578896387 2020-10-23 13:50:21 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, looks like Joe's not the only one who's senile.
1319510050717618176 2020-10-23 13:24:46 +0800 <Camelback71> Prop 187 was so unpopular in California it became law with 59% of the vote in 1994.
1319509551540912128 2020-10-23 13:22:47 +0800 <Camelback71> You have to be a special degree of stupid to think Pete Wilson and Prop 187 destroyed the California GOP
1319473585388310530 2020-10-23 10:59:52 +0800 <Camelback71> Damage control.
1319473138820788229 2020-10-23 10:58:05 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried Pennsylvania: Hold my beer.
1319468636583591936 2020-10-23 10:40:12 +0800 <Camelback71> Please shut up: Every question, once again, came from a Leftist premise.
1319464473820688384 2020-10-23 10:23:39 +0800 <Camelback71> Who had Joe Biden giving Abraham Lincoln the Howard Zinn treatment tonight?
1319456342046769153 2020-10-23 09:51:20 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin His answers at this point are gibberish. He's mixing up policies and issues.
1319455805406523393 2020-10-23 09:49:12 +0800 <Camelback71> We still have 40 minutes to go and Biden looks like he's going to collapse .
1319447638979194880 2020-10-23 09:16:45 +0800 <Camelback71> Once again, the moderator is doing some heavy lifting for Biden
1319429435976802304 2020-10-23 08:04:26 +0800 <Camelback71> @no_sifty I'll be there when we need to steal some tanks from the local armory.  And, at this rate, we will have to.
1319428585220833280 2020-10-23 08:01:03 +0800 <Camelback71> This news is being ghettoized and the fact is only Fox, among the big networks, is even covering this as a straight news story.  Twitter trending?  Nope. Facebook news feed? Nope. Still don't think the media, including Jack and Zuckerberg, aren't the enemy of the American people?
1319410131117879296 2020-10-23 06:47:43 +0800 <Camelback71> @end_isnear Warm, tasty manure.
1319402314709520384 2020-10-23 06:16:39 +0800 <Camelback71> A "pivotal point" for panic porn purveyors like @LaurieRoberts.
1319396741666336768 2020-10-23 05:54:31 +0800 <Camelback71> Nah, the Biden crime family is.
1319396336278532096 2020-10-23 05:52:54 +0800 <Camelback71> Take off the masks.
1319395845691764736 2020-10-23 05:50:57 +0800 <Camelback71> @zones2surf @GOP The future of the Republican Party isn't having 240 Guy Bensons running the House and 55 Charlie Kirks running the Senate with Ben Shapiro in the White House.
1319393240836009985 2020-10-23 05:40:36 +0800 <Camelback71> If the historic American nation is to survive it needs to categorically reject all of this.  All of it. Tim Scott is not an alternative to Black Lives Matter.  And Cawthorn here is simply repackaging Paul Ryanism.
1319380750194540544 2020-10-23 04:50:58 +0800 <Camelback71> The hard core Communists, of which there are way too many in America at this point in time, will still vote for the scumbag.  But, will Biden-leaners reconsider? I wish I wasn't a pessimist at heart.
1319365021487394816 2020-10-23 03:48:28 +0800 <Camelback71> "Is Mr. Bobulinski, who's sitting right over there, lying about your business dealings with him? You do acknowledge knowing and meeting with the man, right?"
1319364183708766209 2020-10-23 03:45:08 +0800 <Camelback71> @wendelltalks He definitely says NO.  https://t.co/8eQ8lzpdGG
1319362281767981056 2020-10-23 03:37:35 +0800 <Camelback71> The Arizona Republic was once a great newspaper.  Now, its nothing more than lefty rag.
1319360103410094080 2020-10-23 03:28:55 +0800 <Camelback71> Pronouns are all about a silly, absurd political agenda.
1319308261259055109 2020-10-23 00:02:55 +0800 <Camelback71> If you're having trouble keeping up:  The Left is on a mission to erase the history and culture of pre-1965 America and replace its people.    https://t.co/39wl3ytiwo
1319273171309060096 2020-10-22 21:43:29 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin When your adversaries are digging a hole, give them more shovels.
1319120089371717633 2020-10-22 11:35:12 +0800 <Camelback71> Listen to the fifth columnists in the administration not the guy whose continually called us on our lies.
1319119522947690496 2020-10-22 11:32:56 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried McSally is running on Trump's coattails because other than her votes on judges, she has no real issues to run. Her entire campaign is built on Kelly being a stooge of the ChiComs.
1319117421312004096 2020-10-22 11:24:35 +0800 <Camelback71> Yes, even sociopaths can show empathy.
1319101102734753792 2020-10-22 10:19:45 +0800 <Camelback71> I'm not sure that idea included racial quotas, abortion on demand, gay marriage, unending legal immigration and unaccountable oligarchs policing speech.
1319100258991788033 2020-10-22 10:16:24 +0800 <Camelback71> Don't forget, this guy's entire radio show acts as signal boost for swamp creatures. The only reason he's dumping on the Commission is because he's repeatedly been passed over for a seat at the moderater's table.
1319098357550178304 2020-10-22 10:08:50 +0800 <Camelback71> Can we clone her?
1319094930480926720 2020-10-22 09:55:13 +0800 <Camelback71> If you think this ends with Hunter or his dad being frogmarched out of this or that house in cuffs you haven't been paying attention the last four years.  https://t.co/YuLIY5dzkf
1319023985707732994 2020-10-22 05:13:19 +0800 <Camelback71> @MelLynnAz This is more evidence for why the Trafalgar Group's polls are probably the most accurate about the election.  Trafalgar knows there are alot shy Trump voters out there, a lot more than the mainstream media believes or is willing to find.
1319008715974963200 2020-10-22 04:12:38 +0800 <Camelback71> Why shouldn't he?  Other than ghettoized conservatives like yourself, radio talkers and us shadowbanned rubes on Twitter, whose going to hold him to account?
1319007579532505088 2020-10-22 04:08:07 +0800 <Camelback71> Time to repeal your mask mandate, @maricopacounty
1319006918203981824 2020-10-22 04:05:29 +0800 <Camelback71> Yes, @ejmontini, the "medical experts" like Fauci and Birx have been so right about the virus this entire time.
1318978321242189824 2020-10-22 02:11:51 +0800 <Camelback71> @no_sifty Who at this point can actually argue with a straight face that pedophilia and pederasty aren't heading toward normalization?
1318977926633680896 2020-10-22 02:10:17 +0800 <Camelback71> The health Nazis and their willing accomplices in the media are pushing for lockdowns again.
1318976973385838592 2020-10-22 02:06:30 +0800 <Camelback71> Don't you rubes understand?  Get with the program! We here in the New York and DC establishment are a bunch of degenerates.
1318954801896464384 2020-10-22 00:38:24 +0800 <Camelback71> It's easy to outspend your opponent when your donors are breaking campaign finance law.
1318954306444304385 2020-10-22 00:36:26 +0800 <Camelback71> $25 billion? ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
1318953878595850241 2020-10-22 00:34:44 +0800 <Camelback71> @Sithplayer_ @Susan_Hennessey Omar Bradley was an American general and had nothing to do with Operating Market Garden.  The Brit General was Bernard Law Montgomery (Monty).  He did devise the plan and Eisenhower signed off on it.  Monty fucked up by ignoring the intelligence reports on German troop strength.
1318952213251674114 2020-10-22 00:28:07 +0800 <Camelback71> Promote mask wearing because they've worked so well, especially in places like Los Angeles, Alabama, Miami and Denver.  Stop holding rallies... wait, BLM rallies? Nah, they're okay.  Accept scientists recommendations because they've been so right this entire time!
1318941389674008577 2020-10-21 23:45:06 +0800 <Camelback71> Whose the chief law enforcement officer of the country again?  Hint:  It ain't Barr.
1318940790966472705 2020-10-21 23:42:43 +0800 <Camelback71> You're telling me there isn't a majority of Cardinals willing to sack this clown? https://t.co/e4EDOjH2io
1318902625023094785 2020-10-21 21:11:04 +0800 <Camelback71> @TrustThePlant This might be the most asanine take I've seen on Twitter in months. And there are so many of them.
1318901997806891013 2020-10-21 21:08:34 +0800 <Camelback71> How many of those sons, grandsons, nephews and neighbors are pederasts with million dollar bank accounts?
1318770288843137024 2020-10-21 12:25:13 +0800 <Camelback71> She had a number of underlying conditions. I'm shocked.
1318765882890362880 2020-10-21 12:07:42 +0800 <Camelback71> There's actually a special place in hell for the parents who either brought or let their children to cross the border illegally.
1318728494730260480 2020-10-21 09:39:08 +0800 <Camelback71> @MelLynnAz Yup. The casedemic is again here.
1318728192505491456 2020-10-21 09:37:56 +0800 <Camelback71> The virus doesn't kill infants. The response to the virus does.
1318727444816277504 2020-10-21 09:34:58 +0800 <Camelback71> Gaslighting. That's all you and your colleagues do.
1318726932775661568 2020-10-21 09:32:56 +0800 <Camelback71> I'm more with Denise here than Julie Kelly. On Thursday night Trump must have a coherent, reassuring answer on the health care issue. Either that or he better announce he's handing  out Trumpbux on Friday.
1318724821513949184 2020-10-21 09:24:32 +0800 <Camelback71> @ReadersLeadPD Voted "No" this afternoon.

1318672491959611392 2020-10-21 05:56:36 +0800 <Camelback71> Cheap labor advocates and their congressional stooges like Mike Lee value immigrants, not America.
1318671165695565825 2020-10-21 05:51:20 +0800 <Camelback71> Nonsense, huh @jaketapper?
1318670725725581312 2020-10-21 05:49:35 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist @julie_kelly2 @NBurdens Oh yeah.  Still is. I can stomach a Steve Deace podcast once in while and Buck Sexton isn't horrible but Beck is still peddling the socialism nonsense on his show daily. A daily cringe-a-thon.
1318670239404417024 2020-10-21 05:47:39 +0800 <Camelback71> So you're limiting your public appearances because you have a 1% chance of dying of a virus?
1318668882639384576 2020-10-21 05:42:15 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist @julie_kelly2 @NBurdens Don't forget she had enablers at the Blaze, foremost of among them that schizophrenic lunatic Beck.  He needed viewers, she provided the eye candy. A truly mutual grift.
1318667132972924935 2020-10-21 05:35:18 +0800 <Camelback71> Twitter is an illegal in-kind contribution to the Biden campaign.
1318648452709048323 2020-10-21 04:21:05 +0800 <Camelback71> Twitter is an illegal in-kind contribution to the Biden campaign.
1318647169558192129 2020-10-21 04:15:59 +0800 <Camelback71> Twitter is an illegal in-kind contribution to the Biden campaign.

1318638106703130624 2020-10-21 03:39:58 +0800 <Camelback71> Twitter is an illegal in-kind contribution to the Biden campaign.
1318637318341750785 2020-10-21 03:36:50 +0800 <Camelback71> @fenixash8 @OLDLADYBOOBZ Every quote tweet done by a Trump voter should now read "Twitter is an illegal in-kind contribution to the Biden campaign."
1318561282283302912 2020-10-20 22:34:42 +0800 <Camelback71> Utah Republicans will be voting for a useful idiot.
1318559894883176448 2020-10-20 22:29:11 +0800 <Camelback71> @blanarovich The comments to Melissa's tweet are comedy gold. A mixture of bots and "republicans"...lol
1318558663171256321 2020-10-20 22:24:17 +0800 <Camelback71> Of course you do. They're the perfect group of useful idiots.
1318557878232428550 2020-10-20 22:21:10 +0800 <Camelback71> If you're voting for the pro-abortion, pro-riot, pro-racial strife ticket, you're not conservative.
1318484401903202304 2020-10-20 17:29:12 +0800 <Camelback71> If you thought "Cuties" pushed new boundaries...
1318425252183994372 2020-10-20 13:34:09 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried No doubt that at this point too many American whites, especially those in their 20s and 30s, are thoroughly racked by white guilt, much of it brought about by the popularity of Howard Zinn's Hate Your Country history book.
1318423862233591809 2020-10-20 13:28:38 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried ...the Central Americanization of Northern Virginia, Richmond and Carolina's tech triangle. /End
1318423499233349633 2020-10-20 13:27:11 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried No amount of GOP outreach is going to solve the Mexicanization (and blue storm) over the American southwest just as running silly moderates in NoVa has stopped /2
1318422963784306688 2020-10-20 13:25:04 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried Let's not get ahead of ourselves here. Hispanics in ploarized South American countries cut a wholely different demographic than Mexican and Central American Hispanics. /1
1318418005626286081 2020-10-20 13:05:22 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried ...the caudillo effect.
1318417660653182976 2020-10-20 13:03:59 +0800 <Camelback71> More and more, I‚Äôm thinking the answer to lots of our national embarrassments - and I‚Äôm just spitballing here - might be...repeal of the 19th Amendment?
1318416034127249409 2020-10-20 12:57:32 +0800 <Camelback71> @KirstenHalpin @MelLynnAz Pork mutts. A truly hideous looking animal.
1318415755491209217 2020-10-20 12:56:25 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried The state I can't keep getting out of my head is Iowa. There has to be genuine split in the older population (55+) because of the virus. Nothing causes a boomer to do something stupid faster than when they're dwelling on their mortality.
1318412955902341120 2020-10-20 12:45:18 +0800 <Camelback71> I'd take them six days a week and twice on Sunday if the alternative is the Ivy League pricks we get stuck with year in and year out.
1318412429903081472 2020-10-20 12:43:12 +0800 <Camelback71> ...brought to you by the same folks who said Iraq had WMDs.
1318411708587597826 2020-10-20 12:40:20 +0800 <Camelback71> @demontage2000 How convenient.
1318379443493154823 2020-10-20 10:32:08 +0800 <Camelback71> The NBA is 90% black but doesn't have a racism problem?
1318378324004114432 2020-10-20 10:27:41 +0800 <Camelback71> @TOOEdit You're kidding yourself if you think Biden's mic will be cut if Trump is making those points. The mic shut off will be a one way street at various times of the debate. Bank on it.
1318377113423151109 2020-10-20 10:22:52 +0800 <Camelback71> @SenTedCruz gaslighting on Twitter in 3, 2, and 1...
1318366956672569344 2020-10-20 09:42:31 +0800 <Camelback71> The only difference between Thomas Friedman and this clown is the shitty hat.
1318346107877875712 2020-10-20 08:19:40 +0800 <Camelback71> He's none of those things if he's voting for Biden.  NONE.
1318345574920278022 2020-10-20 08:17:33 +0800 <Camelback71> @blanarovich Amen.  I'm still pissed off he abstained from giving his endorsement to the Goodlatte immigration bill in the House in 2018.  By remaining silent he enabled Ryan to bring forward his poison pill bill and sabotage the entire process.
1318344811024281600 2020-10-20 08:14:31 +0800 <Camelback71> Why?  You're comparing two states with a borough of a city in another state.
1318340817434472448 2020-10-20 07:58:39 +0800 <Camelback71> Mr. President @realDonaldTrump walk away now. Walk away.  This debate is nothing more than an ambush.
1318339473277558785 2020-10-20 07:53:18 +0800 <Camelback71> @HZardoz No Kennedy, no homosexual jurisprudence.  It's that simple.
1318338997349883905 2020-10-20 07:51:25 +0800 <Camelback71> This Supreme Court ruling may well usher in the Civil War we've all been talking about.  Question is will Trump cross the Rubicon?
1318333696693338114 2020-10-20 07:30:21 +0800 <Camelback71> In four years, Carpenter has gone from supposed conservative Republican working for Ted Cruz to endorsing ballot stuffing by Democrats.
1318332400632430592 2020-10-20 07:25:12 +0800 <Camelback71> @VDAREJamesK I believe, but I'd have to confirm, the Republican Party of Pennsylvania could re-file upon ACB's seating on the Court.  Of course, the GOP Senate is dithering on the vote.
1318331899387944960 2020-10-20 07:23:12 +0800 <Camelback71> Justice Roberts strikes a blow for the Democrat Party's ballot stuffers in Pennsylvania.
1318330808453586945 2020-10-20 07:18:52 +0800 <Camelback71> Toobin won't be fired for spanking the monkey on a zoom call. But seriously, how is that an "all too human moment" during a work-related video conference call?
1318320832267968513 2020-10-20 06:39:14 +0800 <Camelback71> @dustopian It's laughable reading through all the comments to any conservative blue check marks tweets about the Post story.  At least half of the comments are posted by these bot accounts.
1318319743833550848 2020-10-20 06:34:54 +0800 <Camelback71> Fauci is hardly a medical professional at this point.  He's a self-aggrandizing poseur whose bilking his renewed fame with Vanity Fair profiles.
1318318628425457666 2020-10-20 06:30:28 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist Rush was among the first to embrace podcasting as well.  He knew the medium and he monetized it.
1318298307270094848 2020-10-20 05:09:43 +0800 <Camelback71> @OLDLADYBOOBZ A real peach.
1318291076541640704 2020-10-20 04:40:59 +0800 <Camelback71> @VDAREJamesK Arizona I can understand.  I live here.  Republicans are living on borrowed time here no matter how many miles long the Trump caravan I witnessed on Saturday was.  I'd like to think there's no excuse for Trump not to have IA and NC locked but I think that's a product of the virus
1318283961999806467 2020-10-20 04:12:43 +0800 <Camelback71> That's not what he said.
1318282554584272896 2020-10-20 04:07:08 +0800 <Camelback71> @BasedHobbit @HeritageAmeric6 Same here. But I believe my ancestry came back with a mix of Britain Celt and Ireland Celt with some Scottish, German and Flemish/French sprinkled in.
1318276998855262208 2020-10-20 03:45:03 +0800 <Camelback71> Apparently he's done enough for Israel.
1318276391901814786 2020-10-20 03:42:38 +0800 <Camelback71> @ElectricRoll  https://t.co/vY1dgJzn65
1318274950990495744 2020-10-20 03:36:55 +0800 <Camelback71> Where's the rest of the chart you dishonest sack of shit?
1318274253800624128 2020-10-20 03:34:09 +0800 <Camelback71> Don't get your panties in a wad, sweetie.
1318273418865893376 2020-10-20 03:30:50 +0800 <Camelback71> @ElectricRoll There was no strawman. I simply summed up your silly tweetstorm.
1318270655805095938 2020-10-20 03:19:51 +0800 <Camelback71> Lockdowns didn't work because it wasn't a unified national lockdown. These morons still think you can hide from a virus until a magical vaccine appears.
1318269339577905152 2020-10-20 03:14:37 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin @CNN Keep in mind most corporate employees would be fired, not suspended.  Toobin is given some ridiculous in-house review and investigation as if the video evidence doesn't suffice.
1318254429124976645 2020-10-20 02:15:22 +0800 <Camelback71> @josh_hammer @davereaboi When you ask?  When the oligarchs at Woke Capital stop throwing bread crumbs at places like Cato and Heritage and upon cheap politicians like Mike Lee.
1318252590988021761 2020-10-20 02:08:04 +0800 <Camelback71> No more "pro-growth tax policy" for Woke Capital.  It's time for conservatives to reject this nonsense and to reject Woke Capital's paid stooges at the Heritage Foundation.
1318250776309891072 2020-10-20 02:00:51 +0800 <Camelback71> @fenixash8 Savage is one to talk.  An insecure germaphobe with mommy issues.  Jeesh.
1318242234014158849 2020-10-20 01:26:55 +0800 <Camelback71> He simply lies and repeats discredited narratives ad infinitum.  And the media will do nothing to hold the bastard accountable.
1318185840762236930 2020-10-19 21:42:49 +0800 <Camelback71> There is no normalcy.
1318185751104745472 2020-10-19 21:42:28 +0800 <Camelback71> So according to your silly logic, if no vaccine ever materializes it's masks forever.
1318182241751629826 2020-10-19 21:28:31 +0800 <Camelback71> Another bot.
1318181975606218752 2020-10-19 21:27:28 +0800 <Camelback71> It wasn't helpful bringing in a guy who told the truth about the virus.
1318180905752567810 2020-10-19 21:23:13 +0800 <Camelback71> Morally superior and culturally insurmountable? You're continent is now overrun with third worlders who behead your people if you so much as draw a cartoon they find offensive.
1318180003071152129 2020-10-19 21:19:37 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, the "actual news" isn't propaganda or anything at this point.
1318141308779724800 2020-10-19 18:45:52 +0800 <Camelback71> This tweet featured today in my indoctrination lecture.
1318139882745679872 2020-10-19 18:40:12 +0800 <Camelback71> Why not just say the dog ate my homework? Your study simply proved masks do not work and are pointless.
1318063490938982402 2020-10-19 13:36:39 +0800 <Camelback71> Sir, this is a Wendy's.
1318063301150994432 2020-10-19 13:35:54 +0800 <Camelback71> Now the story is fake.

1318036926293659650 2020-10-19 11:51:05 +0800 <Camelback71> @blanarovich Just horrible.
1318018684485472256 2020-10-19 10:38:36 +0800 <Camelback71> No. No. No.
1318017170652106753 2020-10-19 10:32:35 +0800 <Camelback71> Where were you when they came for Alex Jones? Laura Loomer? When the Silicon Valley deplatformed dissident websites?
1318016516806242304 2020-10-19 10:29:59 +0800 <Camelback71> It's embarrassing that our mother country has a freer press than we do.  https://t.co/UuafsVtSR9
1317965693816467458 2020-10-19 07:08:02 +0800 <Camelback71> Losing all of one's brain cells needn't happen overnight.
1317914608846270465 2020-10-19 03:45:03 +0800 <Camelback71> You have the Vice President putting a For Sale sign out on US foreign policy and this dipshit is lauding the bastard's parenting skills.
1317879290818523137 2020-10-19 01:24:42 +0800 <Camelback71> "our rules" publishers have rules, neutral content providers do not.
1317863938315476994 2020-10-19 00:23:42 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin The Never Trumpers' are now openly hinting at Truth and Reconciliation Camps, Nuremberg style trials for outspoken Trump supporters and reeducation camps for us rubes.
1317852464301830144 2020-10-18 23:38:06 +0800 <Camelback71> The only thing that escalates is the number of FBI-induced white supremacist "plots".
1317844849735839744 2020-10-18 23:07:51 +0800 <Camelback71> How's South Africa doing these days?
1317843666300366850 2020-10-18 23:03:09 +0800 <Camelback71> That means it's a dead heat there.
1317842704861077504 2020-10-18 22:59:19 +0800 <Camelback71> @NNJ_Taxman I want to see Biden's bank records, not his tax returns. Everyone knows political graft cash is Switzerland's and the Cayman's number one commodity.
1317842175544094725 2020-10-18 22:57:13 +0800 <Camelback71> Biden needs to release his bank records not just his tax returns, Chris. This includes his Cayman and Swiss accounts.
1317840852048211968 2020-10-18 22:51:58 +0800 <Camelback71> I hope so.   https://t.co/yRVYQa57KQ
1317839689101975553 2020-10-18 22:47:20 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist 75-80¬∞ and mostly sunny - with the occasional chance of a shower.
1317838942780076032 2020-10-18 22:44:22 +0800 <Camelback71> Catastrophic increases? Lmao. The survival rate for the virus is 99%. The end.
1317838260022824963 2020-10-18 22:41:40 +0800 <Camelback71> I do to but you Marxist totalitarians aren't going extinct overnight.
1317837736829624321 2020-10-18 22:39:35 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist Haven't seen any in public yet out here in AZ but I fully expect to spot one or two or more??! when I go vote on Nov 3.

1317833737342648320 2020-10-18 22:23:41 +0800 <Camelback71> More panic porn scolding.
1317833193127436289 2020-10-18 22:21:32 +0800 <Camelback71> @tonib If there were some truth in marketing applied to the "conservative movement" and the politicians, bureaucrats and media who profit from it, it would be more properly tagged Grifting and Gaslighting, Inc.
1317830307337232384 2020-10-18 22:10:04 +0800 <Camelback71> How bout we all just jettison free speech and freedom of expression?
1317827186171072512 2020-10-18 21:57:39 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya,,, that's not how this works. You don't send your big gun into a sure win state when the margin for winning is thin and the stakes are so high.
1317711936893513728 2020-10-18 14:19:42 +0800 <Camelback71> @Skyejohnson4 Fuck...that.
1317711763157118976 2020-10-18 14:19:00 +0800 <Camelback71> Trump hits 56% of the White vote in America he wins. Period.
1317659485893054464 2020-10-18 10:51:17 +0800 <Camelback71> Orson Welles will always be my favorite closet Marxist because he bagged Rita.
1317658425036136448 2020-10-18 10:47:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Vaginapalooza has turned into a superspreader event.
1317657778828185600 2020-10-18 10:44:30 +0800 <Camelback71> @NightmarEclipse Jonah is now reduced to wet fart after wet fart. A glorious spectacle if you ask me.
1317656689118646273 2020-10-18 10:40:10 +0800 <Camelback71> 2020: America 1776-1996 vs. Alien Nation.
1317647113342181378 2020-10-18 10:02:07 +0800 <Camelback71> @NightmarEclipse ...and of course he restricts his comments.

1317523226440855553 2020-10-18 01:49:50 +0800 <Camelback71> Legal immigration needs a permanent stop, for 20 years at least.
1317522811850608646 2020-10-18 01:48:11 +0800 <Camelback71> Fuck off.
1317509967490867200 2020-10-18 00:57:09 +0800 <Camelback71> Bingo.
1317508440634187779 2020-10-18 00:51:05 +0800 <Camelback71> Then why hasn't your emergency order been lifted?

1317507122863640576 2020-10-18 00:45:50 +0800 <Camelback71> @NNJ_Taxman Twitter jail?
1317466612325183488 2020-10-17 22:04:52 +0800 <Camelback71> @NightmarEclipse Probably the same people who think William F. Buckley is a saint.
1317416134476324865 2020-10-17 18:44:17 +0800 <Camelback71> Trump needs to walk away from this set-up.
1317415105986842626 2020-10-17 18:40:12 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao.
1317413145770483712 2020-10-17 18:32:24 +0800 <Camelback71> A good father's decency includes skimmy half of his troubled son's ill-gotten gains from a sleazy Ukranian oil and gas company.
1317329271820447744 2020-10-17 12:59:07 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried Not gonna happen.
1317318909737852930 2020-10-17 12:17:57 +0800 <Camelback71> When in trouble, blame Russia.
1317318755521712128 2020-10-17 12:17:20 +0800 <Camelback71> He's right.
1317318054083088384 2020-10-17 12:14:33 +0800 <Camelback71> This clown bills himself as a "Super Genius" but has no clue what 20 pcr vs 40 pcr is.
1317316173751484417 2020-10-17 12:07:05 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, a real threat to the republic. LoL
1317315031600492545 2020-10-17 12:02:32 +0800 <Camelback71> This is laughable.
1317313738865692673 2020-10-17 11:57:24 +0800 <Camelback71> @TrustThePlant 20 pcr vs. 40 pcr testing... Guess which one we are using here...
1317306618212544512 2020-10-17 11:29:06 +0800 <Camelback71> Pretty soon this prick will be providing free instant testing of stool samples to find more cases.

1317218090841563137 2020-10-17 05:37:20 +0800 <Camelback71> Chris Christie should simply stop eating at Five Guys everyday.
1317159886078185472 2020-10-17 01:46:03 +0800 <Camelback71> I like decent people who engage in billion dollar government graft.
1316582355390230528 2020-10-15 11:31:09 +0800 <Camelback71> It's too bad you guys had the majority in 2017 and 2018 and did...nothing to stop it.
1316581955450748928 2020-10-15 11:29:33 +0800 <Camelback71> You're joking, right?

1316562976653017096 2020-10-15 10:14:08 +0800 <Camelback71> @ThatParentP4P Two or more cases is an outbreak?? That's insane
1316562631461801984 2020-10-15 10:12:46 +0800 <Camelback71> @ThatParentP4P This is absurd. I've never seen such a ridiculous half assed explanation for a quarantine.
1316561801086033920 2020-10-15 10:09:28 +0800 <Camelback71> Amen
1316560966532755456 2020-10-15 10:06:09 +0800 <Camelback71> NR had no problem with either social media platforms' repression of dissident voices on the right.
1316560457314963457 2020-10-15 10:04:08 +0800 <Camelback71> Yup.
1316559915494768641 2020-10-15 10:01:59 +0800 <Camelback71> Was food in the ethnostate known as the United States terrible in 1985? 1975? 1965? 1945? 1935? 1925?
1316553619441741824 2020-10-15 09:36:57 +0800 <Camelback71> @YKatsnelsonLaw @toddflister Sir, this is a Wendy's...  https://t.co/G1UK31En80
1316547305554604034 2020-10-15 09:11:52 +0800 <Camelback71> @YKatsnelsonLaw @toddflister Sorry, you couldn't have made that same argument in 1964. The reason hotels and restaurants desegregated was due to government enforcement, not because you couldn't find them.
1316541362947321856 2020-10-15 08:48:15 +0800 <Camelback71> @toddflister @YKatsnelsonLaw How many hotels, restaurants and sports stadiums have you been to lately where they are still racially discriminating against their customers?
1316537293071499264 2020-10-15 08:32:05 +0800 <Camelback71> If the government can police racial discrimination it sure as hell can police viewpoint discrimination.
1316529944692838406 2020-10-15 08:02:53 +0800 <Camelback71> So, business as usual.
1316520880202153986 2020-10-15 07:26:52 +0800 <Camelback71> @VDAREJamesK Exactly. Treat the Twitters and Facebooks just like you would a hotel, restaurant or other public accomodation. In this case, the social media companies can't engage in viewpoint discrimination, even if some people might find that viewpoint repugnant.
1316519594681491457 2020-10-15 07:21:45 +0800 <Camelback71> Yes Dave. Are you oblivious to woke Capital? 50% of the country stands a better chance seeing their viewpoints circulating free of censorship with the government in control.
1316518883608555520 2020-10-15 07:18:56 +0800 <Camelback71> @thebstiles The fact is they should be playing. No masks. No social distancing. End the absurdity. The virus is here. Sweden is living life normally. We should be doing the same.
1316517921825284096 2020-10-15 07:15:06 +0800 <Camelback71> @thebstiles Then why are they playing? The virus can never be contained.  And besidess, masks don't work when others around you are wearing them.  There's no scientific study that says that and don't point me to the CDC or WHO with their silly diagrams.
1316516095864434689 2020-10-15 07:07:51 +0800 <Camelback71> @thebstiles But I thought we were stopping outbreaks? Stopping the spread? If not, why are they playing?
1316514756769923072 2020-10-15 07:02:32 +0800 <Camelback71> Talk to McConnell who buried your bill.
1316514534123741184 2020-10-15 07:01:39 +0800 <Camelback71> Saban was around people who regularly wear masks.  He still got it.  Masks are useless.
1316514216593874949 2020-10-15 07:00:23 +0800 <Camelback71> They don't work. And?
1316514056405041152 2020-10-15 06:59:45 +0800 <Camelback71> Let's test for the flu so we can prevent outbreaks of that too.  It kills you know.
1316495549089017857 2020-10-15 05:46:12 +0800 <Camelback71> See everybody, the problem is fixed!  Hugh has championed the New York Post through his massive Twitter following.  No need to crush Big Tech and their social media platforms.  Move along, move along.
1316484671098634240 2020-10-15 05:02:59 +0800 <Camelback71> @fenixash8 Gaslighting. Gaslighting. Gaslighting.
1316477084642889728 2020-10-15 04:32:50 +0800 <Camelback71> The gaslighting from normie cons and elected Republicans over the New York Post story is nauseating.
1316475470020444160 2020-10-15 04:26:25 +0800 <Camelback71> This is just gaslighting at this point.  Junior here knows GOP voters have been warning of this for year and his Dad could have done something about this during the last 4 years, could have pushed the Congress during 2017-2018 but punted.
1316474602936131585 2020-10-15 04:22:58 +0800 <Camelback71> @NNJ_Taxman Good God, don't remind of that nonsense.
1316473705480900613 2020-10-15 04:19:24 +0800 <Camelback71> Wicker is running out the clock.  The GOP Senate is deliberately sabotaging the President's reelection and deep sixing this story in the NY Post helps accomplish that.
1316473211698126848 2020-10-15 04:17:27 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried They aren't even remotely similar.  One was salacious gossip at best, a fairy tale at worst.  The other is a verifiable story with concrete evidence to back it up.
1316472773150044161 2020-10-15 04:15:42 +0800 <Camelback71> Hawley's censorship bill, like Cotton's immigration bill, has been deep sixed by McConnell and the rest of the useless GOP caucus in the Senate.
1316472342688657408 2020-10-15 04:14:00 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried They crossed that line over 3 years ago, silencing dissident voices one by one on both platforms.  Nobody on the right cared or worse egged them on.
1316471842912178176 2020-10-15 04:12:00 +0800 <Camelback71> Oh no! Is he dead?
1316471294724980736 2020-10-15 04:09:50 +0800 <Camelback71> @fenixash8 About 3 years too late.
1316470786190766088 2020-10-15 04:07:48 +0800 <Camelback71> NOW it's a truly dangerous moment for the Republic? NOW?  The "mainstream" right and GOP legislators in America knew this was coming but when dissident voices were deplatformed during the last 4 years it either shrugged its shoulders or tacitly endorsed such censorship.
1316456243284766720 2020-10-15 03:10:01 +0800 <Camelback71> Hey Ted you and your GOP colleagues in the Senate and House could have done something in 2017 and 2018 to put an end to this.  You did nothing.  Your complaints here are nothing but gaslighting.
1316448217647722503 2020-10-15 02:38:08 +0800 <Camelback71> Keep in mind even Bork had notes before him at his hearing.
1316431348706562050 2020-10-15 01:31:06 +0800 <Camelback71> There's only one acceptable set of facts about masks. And it's not the truthful set of facts.
1316430707925889024 2020-10-15 01:28:33 +0800 <Camelback71> She doesn't have two sides, Andy. She's a partisan hack no different than any of her slimeball colleagues.

1316426537994838017 2020-10-15 01:11:59 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried I thought you'd never get around to Ryan's update.  I was confused as well.
1316422185087635457 2020-10-15 00:54:41 +0800 <Camelback71> @ThatParentP4P @KellyTownsend11 I'm not giving these frauds credit for doing the bare minimum.
1316420810664484864 2020-10-15 00:49:13 +0800 <Camelback71> @ThatParentP4P @KellyTownsend11 I think we both have the same political outlook. I just see a glass half empty when it comes to elected Republicans at the local, state and national levels. Most are playing people like us for fools.
1316420302239404032 2020-10-15 00:47:12 +0800 <Camelback71> Where it will go nowhere and be buried.
1316419181420699649 2020-10-15 00:42:45 +0800 <Camelback71> @ThatParentP4P @KellyTownsend11 I'm hardly sitting at my computer. I've been to a few rallies at the Capitol. And I can tell you I rarely see a legislator there. And if it's any legislator, it's Kelly. That's it. The Tucson threesome are all frauds. Ducey lickspittles.
1316414363557912579 2020-10-15 00:23:36 +0800 <Camelback71> @ThatParentP4P The only one who's been vocal on this has been Kelly Townsend. And that's it sweetheart. The rest are frauds who sign a petition, call it a day and go back to be Ducey's lickspittles.
1316412362346225664 2020-10-15 00:15:39 +0800 <Camelback71> @ThatParentP4P No, I'm not missing the target.  The fact is Republicans should be cleaning house on these folk.  Garrett Lewis is right.  They're less than useless.
1316410717273120769 2020-10-15 00:09:07 +0800 <Camelback71> @ThatParentP4P Lmao.  Those weren't rallies organized by Republican legislators.  They were organized by GOP voters.  It's amazing the lengths you'll go to cover for their useless asses.
1316409649843896323 2020-10-15 00:04:52 +0800 <Camelback71> @ThatParentP4P They didn't hold any sweetheart.
1316407794648588289 2020-10-14 23:57:30 +0800 <Camelback71> @RonColeman @ChrisCuomo Ya, he's that stupid.
1316406177761095683 2020-10-14 23:51:05 +0800 <Camelback71> Republicans punted on social media regulation. Just like they punted on legal immigration restrictions.  If they lose this election, this, along with ignoring the health care issue, will be why.
1316405672414605312 2020-10-14 23:49:04 +0800 <Camelback71> No, it won't be.
1316405218049843200 2020-10-14 23:47:16 +0800 <Camelback71> @BillTaggert The fact is the electorate Trump needs cares about health care and Trumpbux.  And he's not talking enough about either and ensuring folks about pre-existing conditions.
1316404829342687233 2020-10-14 23:45:43 +0800 <Camelback71> @BillTaggert It was going to be good for Biden in any case.  Even if he had an audience, the questions would be pre-screened and the answers canned -- no matter how bad Biden mangled the answers due to his dementia.  1/
1316404386671652864 2020-10-14 23:43:58 +0800 <Camelback71> They live in the wrong areas to change electoral politics. They don't live in the Rust Belt states.
1316403699871219712 2020-10-14 23:41:14 +0800 <Camelback71> @ThatParentP4P So, sign a petition and my job is done?  Pathetic.  They could have been holding news conferences and rallies every week and weekend for the last four months and they've done nothing.  Nothing but sign a document everybody has forgotten about.
1316402974734778368 2020-10-14 23:38:21 +0800 <Camelback71> America's politburo, the media, is upset its approved candidate doesn't have exclusive airtime.
1316374459448586240 2020-10-14 21:45:02 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried
1316374087669776386 2020-10-14 21:43:34 +0800 <Camelback71> Vote them all out. They're worthless. Republicans need better leaders in Arizona.
1316373758660100096 2020-10-14 21:42:15 +0800 <Camelback71> The left is now concerned about morals. LoL
1316372512280772611 2020-10-14 21:37:18 +0800 <Camelback71> Hey John, so does the right. Do you hear anyone in normie conservative circles calling for Obergfell go be overturned?
1316323957323096072 2020-10-14 18:24:22 +0800 <Camelback71> They need to do more than sign a damn petition. They should be calling press conferences once every week calling out the Governor. They haven't and won't.
1316323526823952384 2020-10-14 18:22:39 +0800 <Camelback71> Don't vote for that prick. He's a fraud. And Garrett knows it.
1316323112447692801 2020-10-14 18:21:00 +0800 <Camelback71> Nobody gives a shit about your ACU rating you moron.
1316322329287294976 2020-10-14 18:17:54 +0800 <Camelback71> You need to do more than this you fraud.
1316322135552352256 2020-10-14 18:17:07 +0800 <Camelback71> Then why aren't you in front of the Capitol holding rallies every weekend lambasting Ducey and your Democratic colleagues with other Republicans? Why? Because you are a fraud and a liar.
1316253783224061952 2020-10-14 13:45:31 +0800 <Camelback71> Soft balls no doubt for this drug dealer.
1316233845943885824 2020-10-14 12:26:17 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried So long as he's not found with a dead woman in his bed, he'll still have a pulse.
1316233201610706946 2020-10-14 12:23:44 +0800 <Camelback71> @VDAREJamesK It was probably the most explicit exposition of possible John Roberts-itis on her part today, even more so than the George Floyd cringe.
1316231108195807232 2020-10-14 12:15:25 +0800 <Camelback71> ...and we wonder why more and more young Americans turn out to be indoctrinated, woke morons.
1316217631720890371 2020-10-14 11:21:52 +0800 <Camelback71> I believe all of these Republicans can be found in Cindy's Ranchouse in Sedona.  https://t.co/1MLTP1g7qV
1316196865969287168 2020-10-14 09:59:21 +0800 <Camelback71> Truth. California, at this point, is a foreign country.
1316196127926935555 2020-10-14 09:56:25 +0800 <Camelback71> Fuck off asshole.

1316186987469045760 2020-10-14 09:20:06 +0800 <Camelback71> @blanarovich @MelLynnAz Seeing more and more of this hysteria and it does give me pause that there are quite a few seniors out there who are Trump minded but voting for the dementia patient.
1316181262793539584 2020-10-14 08:57:21 +0800 <Camelback71> Apparently this gambling junkie is cowering in his house with a mask on.
1316179350715207686 2020-10-14 08:49:45 +0800 <Camelback71> So long as they're not explicitly yelling "Jew" they're inoculated from any criticism.
1316178839769243648 2020-10-14 08:47:43 +0800 <Camelback71> @HeritageAmeric6 I can already hear the howls from the left if Republicans employed this: Nazi! Goebbels! Fascist! Seig Heil!
1316136923442761728 2020-10-14 06:01:09 +0800 <Camelback71> What nonsense.
1316136691866890240 2020-10-14 06:00:14 +0800 <Camelback71> White supremacy.
1316133934300717056 2020-10-14 05:49:17 +0800 <Camelback71> Why did we allow Hawaii to become a State again?

1314795628120084480 2020-10-10 13:11:20 +0800 <Camelback71> I swear to God will she ever let the guy die?
1314794243873931266 2020-10-10 13:05:50 +0800 <Camelback71> This is what the path to national suicide looks like.
1314777445069848576 2020-10-10 11:59:04 +0800 <Camelback71> You obviously haven't been to the Walmarts in Phoenix and Las Vegas.
1314775527152967681 2020-10-10 11:51:27 +0800 <Camelback71> Losing credibility but they're still running things.
1314775193835851781 2020-10-10 11:50:08 +0800 <Camelback71> M. Stanton Evans book has been out for over 10 years and this supposed principled conservative still thinks McCarthy is the demogoguic monster created and charictured by the left.
1314721561316737025 2020-10-10 08:17:01 +0800 <Camelback71> Suburban women. They'd rather have their lives turned upside down and their neighborhoods trashed by BLM  and Antifa than listen to Trump for 4 more years.  ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1314707329619816449 2020-10-10 07:20:28 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao. You didn't call anything perfectly you windbag.
1314690269812408320 2020-10-10 06:12:40 +0800 <Camelback71> How many people were at that rally?
1314673880854745088 2020-10-10 05:07:33 +0800 <Camelback71> @dustopian He really is the gift that keeps on giving.  Pol Pot's got nothing on Olbermann.
1314669604006838272 2020-10-10 04:50:33 +0800 <Camelback71> Keith is the Id of the left, no filter.
1314656659734581249 2020-10-10 03:59:07 +0800 <Camelback71> @charlimithinks My negativity doesn't drive anybody away from voting Trump. He's the good guy. He's surrounded my deep state stooges who are simply going through the motions.
1314656191188889600 2020-10-10 03:57:15 +0800 <Camelback71> @KellyTownsend11 @dougducey Where are your colleagues?
1314655687536910336 2020-10-10 03:55:15 +0800 <Camelback71> @oblivious_guy Indeed. But there's plenty still moving from the Midwest to these states as well. Here in Arizona, I'm losing my country but I'm fattening my retirement check in 12 years. Belize is looking more and more attractive.
1314654046154711043 2020-10-10 03:48:44 +0800 <Camelback71> Now do the last 7 months.
1314653589214646274 2020-10-10 03:46:55 +0800 <Camelback71> More worthy additions to Anglo-Saxon civilization are crossing the border again.
1314652942742421504 2020-10-10 03:44:21 +0800 <Camelback71> After going through the first 10 months of this year, Dungheep here still misses the forest for the trees.
1314639689375047680 2020-10-10 02:51:41 +0800 <Camelback71> Who wants to bet no leftist narrative will ever be "disputed"?
1314639181151268864 2020-10-10 02:49:40 +0800 <Camelback71> Take that nonsense elsewhere.  He's had more than enough time to bring indictments.  If he finds more malfeasance, he could simply tack on more charges.
1314632524702773248 2020-10-10 02:23:13 +0800 <Camelback71> Yup.
1314632247958413312 2020-10-10 02:22:07 +0800 <Camelback71> This is total bullshit.
1314628997234352128 2020-10-10 02:09:12 +0800 <Camelback71> My esophagus hurts like hell from the amount of barf here.
1314628426687541255 2020-10-10 02:06:56 +0800 <Camelback71> Created in a lab by Jack Kemp, Bill Kristol and the CATO Institute, Paul Ryan is the Frankenstein's monster of the conservative movement.   https://t.co/OpMl6s61ya

1314604186114445313 2020-10-10 00:30:36 +0800 <Camelback71> @JeffLuckadoo @Steve_Sailer Remember there is no LBJ without Oswald.
1314603885324099584 2020-10-10 00:29:25 +0800 <Camelback71> Lee Harvey Oswald. Had he not made JFK a martyr, the Civil Rights of 1964 and Immigration Bill of 1965 may never have passed. At the very least both would have looked drastically different.
1314603205049884673 2020-10-10 00:26:42 +0800 <Camelback71> @NightmarEclipse Can I borrow that? LoL
1314591904051281921 2020-10-09 23:41:48 +0800 <Camelback71> They say it you dipshit because that's the narrative they want out there.  It isn't about truth.  And more often than not you buy their narrative and use it scold Trump and his supporters.
1314590499999674368 2020-10-09 23:36:13 +0800 <Camelback71> ...and I have bridge to sell you in Brooklyn, too.
1314570184389091329 2020-10-09 22:15:30 +0800 <Camelback71> None of these four.
1314566445313925122 2020-10-09 22:00:38 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos Is he really that clueless? Ya, he is.
1314552374573199361 2020-10-09 21:04:43 +0800 <Camelback71> Last time I checked you're voting for Mr. Despicable.
1314551890324066304 2020-10-09 21:02:48 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos Oh, it's totally realz...
1314551772086583298 2020-10-09 21:02:20 +0800 <Camelback71> @DelargeArthur ...and remember those imbeciles would have definitely forgot the duct tape.
1314543417540571138 2020-10-09 20:29:08 +0800 <Camelback71> She is.
1314542494466547712 2020-10-09 20:25:28 +0800 <Camelback71> Nonsense.
1314540467153850368 2020-10-09 20:17:25 +0800 <Camelback71> "Very conservative" judges don't invent tranny rights. Oh wait, they do.
1314540021928480769 2020-10-09 20:15:38 +0800 <Camelback71> Both parties? Democrat judges are the only judges who consistently, without fail, vote in a purely partisan fashion.
1314434702955089921 2020-10-09 13:17:08 +0800 <Camelback71> I keep moving to states that turn blue within 8 years of me moving there.
1314434265375862784 2020-10-09 13:15:24 +0800 <Camelback71> Nah, it's called assimilation. Hate to break it to you but this is an Anglo-Saxon civilization not the Ming dynasty.
1314433771362349058 2020-10-09 13:13:26 +0800 <Camelback71> Major bank flushing 10% of its market cap down a toilet to buy some indulgences from the racial papacy.
1314353735666106368 2020-10-09 07:55:24 +0800 <Camelback71> @_Emperor_Ming_ The comments are even more cringe inducing.
1314349864625602562 2020-10-09 07:40:01 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin @submandave ...and I wonder who's idea that was? The anarchists or the FBI undercover guys... This entire thing stinks.
1314331135992836097 2020-10-09 06:25:36 +0800 <Camelback71> @NNJ_Taxman It's a plot dreamed up by a guy who should be in a mental institution if we actually still had them.
1314317197863514112 2020-10-09 05:30:13 +0800 <Camelback71> ... 5.The FBI purposely misinformed the public this group was a bunch of right-wing paramilitaries.
1314314021751808001 2020-10-09 05:17:36 +0800 <Camelback71> @DelargeArthur Not exactly Reinhard Heydrich material there...
1314309595976724480 2020-10-09 05:00:01 +0800 <Camelback71> @ReallyNotAMoose So we're talking Emma Goldman's great grandson here and a bunch of Hoover boys? Yup, that's got the SS written all over it.
1314308204298342400 2020-10-09 04:54:29 +0800 <Camelback71> Why bother?
1314307861330104320 2020-10-09 04:53:07 +0800 <Camelback71> They weren't even right-wing militia.  They were a bunch of anarchists who most likely have more in common with - wait for it - Antifa.
1314302673303212032 2020-10-09 04:32:30 +0800 <Camelback71> Turns out the Michigan gang of Adolphs are a bunch of Emma Goldmans.
1314287158883045377 2020-10-09 03:30:51 +0800 <Camelback71> File this under "things a Democrat never would have said 40 years ago".
1314271308482441216 2020-10-09 02:27:52 +0800 <Camelback71> Mansplaining hat tip of the day: The word ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù appears nowhere in either the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution.
1314265367737376768 2020-10-09 02:04:16 +0800 <Camelback71> They see their country becoming an unrecognizable mess which is openly hostile to white Americans.
1314263336796602370 2020-10-09 01:56:11 +0800 <Camelback71> Got to love the ominous black and white photography.
1314247446415904768 2020-10-09 00:53:03 +0800 <Camelback71> A New York Times approved conservative.
1314244107234025472 2020-10-09 00:39:47 +0800 <Camelback71> Google Obama and the fly.
1314243547923509248 2020-10-09 00:37:33 +0800 <Camelback71> Kind of hard for a minority group to claim victim status when such group makes up nearly 25% of admissions to every Ivy League school in America and rank as the highest earning ethnic group in the U.S.
1314240963221442562 2020-10-09 00:27:17 +0800 <Camelback71> These days I want to kick adults who still hold a grudge against prep school overachievers.
1314237801316020224 2020-10-09 00:14:43 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin You rang?
1314208615834607616 2020-10-08 22:18:45 +0800 <Camelback71> Neither did Roethlisberger.
1314191768531857410 2020-10-08 21:11:48 +0800 <Camelback71> The summer outbreak of the virus across the Sunbelt was not a second wave. They never had a wave in the spring in the first place.
1314178516884176897 2020-10-08 20:19:09 +0800 <Camelback71> H1B visas for ad infinitum. Ah, no Ned.
1314177875998773249 2020-10-08 20:16:36 +0800 <Camelback71> The Commission's decision to do the Bidens team's bidding and go virusl isn't about the virus. It's about Florida and DeSantis' handling of the virus.
1314176921513521155 2020-10-08 20:12:48 +0800 <Camelback71> @tonib He's right. And I can't help think it's because the debate is scheduled to place in Florida and Biden doesn't want Trump pointing out DeSantis' handling of the virus.
1314175975161163783 2020-10-08 20:09:03 +0800 <Camelback71> This is ridiculous.
1314066748245569537 2020-10-08 12:55:01 +0800 <Camelback71> Mansplaining.
1314065660947783681 2020-10-08 12:50:42 +0800 <Camelback71> Both. But mostly corrupt.
1314059806999633921 2020-10-08 12:27:26 +0800 <Camelback71> Mansplaining.
1314059073764036609 2020-10-08 12:24:31 +0800 <Camelback71> Who'd they survey? The Upper West Side?
1314058565053603840 2020-10-08 12:22:30 +0800 <Camelback71> You can fit those Republicans-for-Biden in a cubicle at the offices of the Bulwark.
1314057840915443713 2020-10-08 12:19:37 +0800 <Camelback71> Mansplaining.
1314057757457219590 2020-10-08 12:19:18 +0800 <Camelback71> Mansplaining.
1314057474765254657 2020-10-08 12:18:10 +0800 <Camelback71> Too bad we see no corresponding change on reductions in legal immigration.
1314056517805510658 2020-10-08 12:14:22 +0800 <Camelback71> Want to know why Con Inc. hasn't helped conserved anything in the last 30 years? Here's another example.
1314055646656909313 2020-10-08 12:10:54 +0800 <Camelback71> Please don't lob softballs like the talk show hosts up here in Phoenix have done. Please.
1314034780661374976 2020-10-08 10:47:59 +0800 <Camelback71> I have a choice between listening to a fly dominate post-debate bullshit session on my local radio station or get back to my Shelby Foote Civil War audiobook. Ya, it's a lay up.
1314033716482637824 2020-10-08 10:43:46 +0800 <Camelback71> Because we don't.
1314032439937822720 2020-10-08 10:38:41 +0800 <Camelback71> I've seen less than 10 minutes of the debate and already know Pence won.
1314029565455462400 2020-10-08 10:27:16 +0800 <Camelback71> @MelLynnAz A fly? LoL.

1314028597556908032 2020-10-08 10:23:25 +0800 <Camelback71> Ok, I'm back. What did I miss?
1313987317690822656 2020-10-08 07:39:23 +0800 <Camelback71> Jen Rubin's tranny sister is back to torture civilization.
1313984523747516416 2020-10-08 07:28:17 +0800 <Camelback71> @NightmarEclipse I'd gladly punch my ticket to go if it included watching that guy rot alongside me.
1313953764089491456 2020-10-08 05:26:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Ah, sure. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1313953543636742144 2020-10-08 05:25:11 +0800 <Camelback71> The NFL has entered the realm of the absurd.
1313942158810980359 2020-10-08 04:39:57 +0800 <Camelback71> Kelly was like a deer in the headlights when McSally rattled of ChiCom baggage. She's as bland as cardboard but he stinks like an overused kitchen incinerator.
1313940073545523200 2020-10-08 04:31:40 +0800 <Camelback71> Keep in mind that this fraud has said nothing about Abbott's lockdowns in his own district.
1313938930958565376 2020-10-08 04:27:07 +0800 <Camelback71> Apparently Kyle here is worried the Marine will infect some intruder he confronts trying to storm the White House.
1313937868558131205 2020-10-08 04:22:54 +0800 <Camelback71> Nations fight wars, not HR departments.
1313937163772399617 2020-10-08 04:20:06 +0800 <Camelback71> @SoothingDave @MollyRatty Not like anyone should miss her normie takes. She's just Ben Shapiro with better hair.
1313894139113553921 2020-10-08 01:29:08 +0800 <Camelback71> Julie Kelly for the win.
1313893774297198592 2020-10-08 01:27:41 +0800 <Camelback71> @BillTaggert @zones2surf Maybe a 5 point swing.  11?  Ludicrous.
1313893462790471682 2020-10-08 01:26:27 +0800 <Camelback71> For a virus with an IFR of .025% and shrinking.
1313892926242451457 2020-10-08 01:24:19 +0800 <Camelback71> Unfortunately, the NFL won't allow it.  And teams can't afford to do it anyways with the Covid protocols the NFL has mandated under penalty of fines and game forfeiture.
1313892062287269893 2020-10-08 01:20:53 +0800 <Camelback71> @MooksInsight @DarrenJBeattie Absolutely. It's because voters, rightly, consider them super legislators not judges.
1313887374019973120 2020-10-08 01:02:15 +0800 <Camelback71> Rasmussen was not the most accurate poll of 2016. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1313878615877181440 2020-10-08 00:27:27 +0800 <Camelback71> It's even worse than that. They admit that herd immunity could be achieved through more active spread but duping the public with mandates gives them time to get in on the vaccine racket.
1313871417721585664 2020-10-07 23:58:51 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried I have no problem believing Trump is down 6 or 7 nationally but these 11-14 point spreads are ridiculous.  The only way these numbers work is if Ras has discovered some heretofore voting bloc of Bill Kristol readers.
1313868442416508928 2020-10-07 23:47:01 +0800 <Camelback71> But painting inner city boulevard street surfaces with "Black Lives Matter" is not a visual distraction.
1313845012971487232 2020-10-07 22:13:55 +0800 <Camelback71> That's why health savings accounts are so important.
1313844651959308288 2020-10-07 22:12:29 +0800 <Camelback71> @MelLynnAz Obamacare sounds like an overly expensive catastrophic plan (CP) without the Health Savings Account which is essential with a CP. Healthcare!
1313826419818942465 2020-10-07 21:00:02 +0800 <Camelback71> Voter suppression? Lmao.
1313825776307826688 2020-10-07 20:57:29 +0800 <Camelback71> @MooksInsight @DarrenJBeattie Ah, most GOP voters are still caught up on Roe. It needs gone.
1313824146132885505 2020-10-07 20:51:00 +0800 <Camelback71> A better question is: Why is the NFL engaging in corona "safety" theatre for a virus that is essentially a bad flu for its players?
1313822040961413121 2020-10-07 20:42:38 +0800 <Camelback71> They crossed the Rubicon. There's no going back to Gaul.
1313717650044776448 2020-10-07 13:47:50 +0800 <Camelback71> If that's the only gaslighting headline Arizona's leftist rag has at this point, you know Mark Kelly got his derriere kicked tonight.
1313717090927271937 2020-10-07 13:45:36 +0800 <Camelback71> @emeriticus @TrustThePlant Amen
1313716958206988288 2020-10-07 13:45:05 +0800 <Camelback71> I'm not sure you want Americans taking a cold hard look at the racial score-settling left in the wake of the South Africa's truth and reconciliation commission.

1313643896803487745 2020-10-07 08:54:45 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist @NightmarEclipse I have no problem with those that argue that the government responded rather late to the AIDs crisis but upholding the irresponsible sexual behavior of homosexuals - even after they became aware of its dangers - as some sort of "truth to power" moment is asasine.
1313643212989374466 2020-10-07 08:52:02 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist @NightmarEclipse That's one of the more bizarre things about him. Nolte, being a Republican convert, has decent taste in flicks but his politics are pockmarked by the radical ideology of the 1980s San Francisco Democrats.
1313640873293348865 2020-10-07 08:42:45 +0800 <Camelback71> Powerful statement.  Nobody except for a handful of Republican governors and the President are listening.
1313640390939955200 2020-10-07 08:40:50 +0800 <Camelback71> Sorry to say, we won't.  Most of the people responsible for this year long nightmare will fail upwards, not downwards.
1313640076740456458 2020-10-07 08:39:35 +0800 <Camelback71> But it will stand. The profession you critique every day has no interest to acknowledging its double-standard.  It's not in the journalism business.  It's in the acquiring power business and throwing dissenters into camps.
1313635662260654081 2020-10-07 08:22:02 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist One of the most wretched phonies in the Never Trump pig sty.

1313619406241452032 2020-10-07 07:17:26 +0800 <Camelback71> LoL.  Your supporters in the media are already talking about putting Trump voters in re-education camps and gulags.

1313553349682233346 2020-10-07 02:54:57 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried a big set back for Biden and Kelly ballot harvesters.
1313546320615940096 2020-10-07 02:27:02 +0800 <Camelback71> This really is the history of the last 4 years and it's why, unfortunately, in addition to the the virus, Trump is having a big problem with35 and older middle and working class whites.
1313538873406840832 2020-10-07 01:57:26 +0800 <Camelback71> It also appears that Arizona was including Banner Health's Urgent Care visits as hospitalizations as well.

1313537847400431616 2020-10-07 01:53:21 +0800 <Camelback71> It wouldn't be a right.  Only a law.
1313537672107847680 2020-10-07 01:52:40 +0800 <Camelback71> Roe enshrines a "right" to abortion.  I'd be fine with an Roe overruled and Congress passing some law allowing abortion -- because laws aren't rights and can be overturned and/or amended much more easily.
1313518647474675712 2020-10-07 00:37:04 +0800 <Camelback71> I wouldn't call Romney's vote "solid".

1313477457140486146 2020-10-06 21:53:23 +0800 <Camelback71> So you do support overturning Obergfell?

1313259087941967872 2020-10-06 07:25:40 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried Populism works in these areas unlike the Bush-Romney libertarianism.  Less talk of tax cuts, more talk of trade, immigration and law and order.

1313233496257695744 2020-10-06 05:43:58 +0800 <Camelback71> @TrustThePlant 25 years ago this was a mainstream argument you could hear on Crossfire.  Thanks to the 1965 Immigration Act and conservatives doing nothing to stop the spread of ethnic studies on college campuses, its now become "white nationalist rhetoric".
1313232911697494017 2020-10-06 05:41:39 +0800 <Camelback71> @SoothingDave @AnnaDsays That's some straight up "I know where everyone's place is on the plantation" shit.
1313212481494376448 2020-10-06 04:20:28 +0800 <Camelback71> Sure.

1313209877037117440 2020-10-06 04:10:07 +0800 <Camelback71> @VDAREJamesK You could say the same of the flu.  And with data coming in every day, the eventual, final IFR most likely will hit somewhat higher than the flu's IFR.  The virus is dangerous for the elderly and those with co-morbidities subsets. The media won't let that be the B&amp;W of things
1313207545616498688 2020-10-06 04:00:51 +0800 <Camelback71> @fenixash8 She's out of her mind.  I've taken both.  I didn't turn into an a**hole. I've always been one.
1313180994699223040 2020-10-06 02:15:21 +0800 <Camelback71> Whose giving him this money? Voters or corporate stooges?
1313172666367574021 2020-10-06 01:42:15 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried No question this is the last time. Arizona is importing way too many legal immigrants from Mexico and Central America ever year as well as absorbing middle class Californians who, on the whole, are reliable Democrat voters.
1313166119922880513 2020-10-06 01:16:15 +0800 <Camelback71> Why do we want to slow the spread of a virus with 98% chance of survival for the vast majority of the population? We don't go through these hoops for the flu which is at 99.999%?
1313165795464077312 2020-10-06 01:14:57 +0800 <Camelback71> That wasn't the argument at all.  Reopening meant isolating the vulnerable, the hospitals were ready for patients and getting back to normal, not masking up, social distancing and restricting restaurants to 50% capacity.
1313164081612779520 2020-10-06 01:08:09 +0800 <Camelback71> Apparently "masked members" were safe from the virus.

1312601117570727936 2020-10-04 11:51:08 +0800 <Camelback71> @NBurdens @julie_kelly2 Ha, ha... Ole Walter blocked me... Must have pissed him off recently
1312598450135916544 2020-10-04 11:40:32 +0800 <Camelback71> Congressional scholar goes full stupid here.
1312597833007067142 2020-10-04 11:38:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Retards.
1312597602236391424 2020-10-04 11:37:09 +0800 <Camelback71> Why should they talk to you? You're not the news anymore.
1312568633755721728 2020-10-04 09:42:03 +0800 <Camelback71> A national security crisis of the first order ...for a virus with a 97% survival rate.
1312539002180788224 2020-10-04 07:44:18 +0800 <Camelback71> Is it 1987 again?
1312510512240816129 2020-10-04 05:51:06 +0800 <Camelback71> CBS News continues run with fake news.
1312510250302365696 2020-10-04 05:50:03 +0800 <Camelback71> @Dejan_Kovacevic What asaninity. A virus with a survival rate of 97% is causing this circus.
1312507871028944896 2020-10-04 05:40:36 +0800 <Camelback71> @demontage2000 @CDCgov @ListerineSam37 It's why I laughed when people kept throwing out the 70% threshold nonsense on herd immunity. There was always going to be a certain amount "banked" immunity from any coronavirus from eons of colds and other c-viruses hitting humanity.
1312503872162729987 2020-10-04 05:24:42 +0800 <Camelback71> Sure "Dr. Mom". Hey how bout them awesome BLM mass protests!
1312503623440502784 2020-10-04 05:23:43 +0800 <Camelback71> The folks who attended the BLM "mass gatherings".  See how this works?
1312503401809207296 2020-10-04 05:22:50 +0800 <Camelback71> Who wants to bet she's not uttered one word of criticism of the BLM mass gatherings?
1312496954232893441 2020-10-04 04:57:13 +0800 <Camelback71> @demontage2000 @CDCgov @ListerineSam37  https://t.co/eVsXwABugX
1312496389130129409 2020-10-04 04:54:58 +0800 <Camelback71> Yes sir.
1312494297871073280 2020-10-04 04:46:40 +0800 <Camelback71> This might be the most accurate bit of news - from a reporter- on the President's condition since yesterday evening.
1312486746815258624 2020-10-04 04:16:39 +0800 <Camelback71> @EdKPyros @TrustThePlant I caught that. Its SOP for all these "Trump's at Death's door" tweets. "I have no way to confirm" but I'll be irresponsible anyways to score a political point.
1312485699581403136 2020-10-04 04:12:30 +0800 <Camelback71> Biden has dementia. Press: *crickets"  Trump gets the China virus. Press wants to perform a colonoscopy on him.
1312483746914816000 2020-10-04 04:04:44 +0800 <Camelback71> Nothing irresponsible here.
1312483126933815296 2020-10-04 04:02:16 +0800 <Camelback71> Fake news
1312463433162342401 2020-10-04 02:44:01 +0800 <Camelback71> Which tells us nothing. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1312463208079187968 2020-10-04 02:43:07 +0800 <Camelback71> If you are in that age group you can assess the risk for yourself. Masks don't mitigate the spread. It was nice chatting.
1312462839626428418 2020-10-04 02:41:40 +0800 <Camelback71> If you want herd immunity, you need more hosts. Why is this so hard? Protect the 70+ group but let the rest of us live
1312452064035782656 2020-10-04 01:58:50 +0800 <Camelback71> @TimBenzPGH Maybe we should all take off the masks and learn to actually live with this virus that has a survival rate of 97% upon an infection. Or we can continue with this nonsense.
1312450529411301378 2020-10-04 01:52:45 +0800 <Camelback71> @MichaelBGood704 What's the point for a virus with an IFR for all but one age group near the flu at this point? This is not the bubonic plague.
1312449860486848512 2020-10-04 01:50:05 +0800 <Camelback71> It's not true but this woman will still put it out there and kvetch over it.
1312445733312684033 2020-10-04 01:33:41 +0800 <Camelback71> @MichaelBGood704 Yes, herd immunity it is. It's called epidemiology 101.
1312444225565290496 2020-10-04 01:27:42 +0800 <Camelback71> Is Mark Meadows treating him or is Dr. Conley? Inquiring minds want to know.
1312443001382166528 2020-10-04 01:22:50 +0800 <Camelback71> Sure, let's wear all wear an N95 mask to mitigate the spread of a virus with a 97% survival rate. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1312442189301989376 2020-10-04 01:19:36 +0800 <Camelback71> If that's your point, it isn't one. It's nothing more than you bitching you didn't hear what you wanted to hear.
1312441690427330560 2020-10-04 01:17:37 +0800 <Camelback71> Of course the Arizona Republic is running with unsubstantiated sources and not the doctor who went on the record.
1312440169132298241 2020-10-04 01:11:34 +0800 <Camelback71> Name the source.
1312439249661095937 2020-10-04 01:07:55 +0800 <Camelback71> "I do not know where this quote came from, and why this anonymous person has the authority to contradict the president‚Äôs doctors", so let me spread this rumor!
1312438710873387010 2020-10-04 01:05:47 +0800 <Camelback71> @MichaelBGood704 Darling, what part of "wearing masks (other than N95) will not be effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whether worn as source control or as PPE" is escaping you here? The issue is the spread not its percentage. By the way, let's check in on Argentina...  https://t.co/frH5T7IVd1
1312421746021003265 2020-10-03 23:58:22 +0800 <Camelback71> Give us the story we want to report or we'll call you liars.
1312413073337016320 2020-10-03 23:23:54 +0800 <Camelback71> If you need any more proof the CDC are political hacks, not health experts.
1312411929760002055 2020-10-03 23:19:22 +0800 <Camelback71> So, is it your position now, that you want the governor of your state to close it back down, close restaurants and gyms and mandate masks?
1312407761813073922 2020-10-03 23:02:48 +0800 <Camelback71> Thread
1312405035628720129 2020-10-03 22:51:58 +0800 <Camelback71> @MichaelBGood704 This article's cinclusion states: "Wearing masks (other than N95) will not be effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whether worn as source control or as PPE."
1312403862070779904 2020-10-03 22:47:18 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao. I love how how Sweden doesn't exist in your universe.
1312389973719490560 2020-10-03 21:52:07 +0800 <Camelback71> Facebook has already declared it fake science. You can't post it there without this popping up.  https://t.co/DFgPgnrHPy
1312387499277213697 2020-10-03 21:42:17 +0800 <Camelback71> The "entire medical community"???You're going with politicized science. I'll go with real science.  https://t.co/uBq9zZH3LO
1312384404325425153 2020-10-03 21:29:59 +0800 <Camelback71> None of this happened.
1312383578244747265 2020-10-03 21:26:42 +0800 <Camelback71> But masks work...
1312378894138314752 2020-10-03 21:08:05 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao.
1312378734654050305 2020-10-03 21:07:27 +0800 <Camelback71> Sure.
1312378526629208065 2020-10-03 21:06:38 +0800 <Camelback71> More than a few people who've since tested positive, including a Times reporter, all wore their masks religiously. How'd they get it too?
1312378136915439616 2020-10-03 21:05:05 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, an infectious virus chose them because they're Republicans.
1312377231415504897 2020-10-03 21:01:29 +0800 <Camelback71> @Loneprotester Good catch. Yikes.
1312374986191978497 2020-10-03 20:52:34 +0800 <Camelback71> The data is the data and truth about the virus (that it's another flu) doesn't change because Trump got it.
1312372057947004928 2020-10-03 20:40:55 +0800 <Camelback71> Sure.
1312371982143377408 2020-10-03 20:40:37 +0800 <Camelback71> If you haven't hugged your mom since March that's not Mike Lee's problem. It's yours.
1312279008814362624 2020-10-03 14:31:11 +0800 <Camelback71> "U.S. Senate candidate"?? Ya, he's a Democrat.
1312275650628087808 2020-10-03 14:17:50 +0800 <Camelback71> @SoothingDave For Tracey that was a regular weekend before April. He has no concept of a social life.
1312275070664884224 2020-10-03 14:15:32 +0800 <Camelback71> He was wearing a mask. What did he have to worry about?
1312272613415116800 2020-10-03 14:05:46 +0800 <Camelback71> No kidding.
1312271102417141763 2020-10-03 13:59:46 +0800 <Camelback71> This is total nonsense. Superspreader events aren't conditioned on wearing masks and social distancing. If the virus is present, it's going to going virus. No amount of magic placebos is going to stop it.
1312270033091915776 2020-10-03 13:55:31 +0800 <Camelback71> Tracey misses the mark much more than he hits it. This here is just plain nauseating.
1312255033791053831 2020-10-03 12:55:55 +0800 <Camelback71> @NNJ_Taxman @BRyvkin Well, thanks for the Monday Morning Quarterback tweet.
1312254704135544834 2020-10-03 12:54:36 +0800 <Camelback71> Too bad Nostradamus wasn't around to tell everybody there somebody there was spreading the virus.
1312252841172451328 2020-10-03 12:47:12 +0800 <Camelback71> They all treat him like garbage, sweetie
1312252628512903168 2020-10-03 12:46:21 +0800 <Camelback71> No.
1312231726110834688 2020-10-03 11:23:18 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried Gulp.
1312165996082335745 2020-10-03 07:02:06 +0800 <Camelback71> The last time someone saw the KKK on TV was a rerun of Mississippi Burning.  It's been that way since a couple of dozen Ku Kluxers marched in Skokie, Illinois in the early 1980s.
1312162294026039296 2020-10-03 06:47:24 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried Republican likely voters are magically showing up in presidential polls -- in the last month of the campaign.
1312153684776636416 2020-10-03 06:13:11 +0800 <Camelback71> I really want to take this red pill.  I really do.
1312153150447521792 2020-10-03 06:11:04 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos Madison's first term was no picnic either.
1312148832596094976 2020-10-03 05:53:54 +0800 <Camelback71> No, he wore a hood.
1312148586780528640 2020-10-03 05:52:56 +0800 <Camelback71> Has you're long national nightmare ended @IvoryJingoist?
1312148341673738240 2020-10-03 05:51:57 +0800 <Camelback71> For those of you who have never lived in Washington, DC, she's full of horseshit here.
1312147867046350848 2020-10-03 05:50:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Tough week I know.  To cheer you up, may I suggest you go home, grab a fifth of Jack at the local supermarket and watch The Exorcist?
1312146350788628481 2020-10-03 05:44:03 +0800 <Camelback71> The Left:  You're not a doctor.  Shut up about the virus.  The Left:  Let me play a soothesayer and doctor at the same time on Twitter.
1312141019333312512 2020-10-03 05:22:52 +0800 <Camelback71> This is nothing more than argument for the Right to accept the Left's gains in the post-2000 era in order to have them cease and desist going full Mao.  It's nonsense.
1312123980082372610 2020-10-03 04:15:09 +0800 <Camelback71> Try imagining yourself believing this fairy tale.
1312123510727217152 2020-10-03 04:13:17 +0800 <Camelback71> For 21 hours a day Fox News is now indistinguishable from MSNBC and CNN.
1312117429779140608 2020-10-03 03:49:07 +0800 <Camelback71> Actually the data suggests quite a good portion of the population is immune at this point.
1312111367835406336 2020-10-03 03:25:02 +0800 <Camelback71> I remember voting in person for Warren Harding in 1920.  And I wasn't wearing a mask.
1312110518899929088 2020-10-03 03:21:40 +0800 <Camelback71> Ah, this isn't an Alexander Haig moment here.
1312100413412319232 2020-10-03 02:41:30 +0800 <Camelback71> They are.
1312100342625038336 2020-10-03 02:41:13 +0800 <Camelback71> They're outside in the fresh air.
1312097923849576449 2020-10-03 02:31:37 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried It will need to do a lot more than "oppose" those items if they plan to be a viable, electable political entity. Opposing simply can't be gaslighting their voters every election cycle while the culture becomes the inside of a critical race theory classroom.
1312096597916954626 2020-10-03 02:26:21 +0800 <Camelback71> The part where the data doesn't back up your assertions on the reduction of spread.
1312094869289013248 2020-10-03 02:19:29 +0800 <Camelback71> @E__Strobel Yes, serious question. Where's your research? And please don't point me to the CDC or WHO websites.
1312092431928573953 2020-10-03 02:09:47 +0800 <Camelback71> Ah, where is the peer-reviewed scientific literature on this?
1312084572578799621 2020-10-03 01:38:34 +0800 <Camelback71> Woke Snoopy.  Just what the world needs.
1312083267219148800 2020-10-03 01:33:22 +0800 <Camelback71> What campaign? He watches The Wendy Williams Show and Golden Girls reruns all day.
1312082807624089600 2020-10-03 01:31:33 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried Haven't seen the crosstabs yet but I'm beginning to think they're polling more Republicans. The D-R-I splits are becoming more realistic. It ask backs up the 2% figure on the debate.
1312082224666214400 2020-10-03 01:29:14 +0800 <Camelback71> So what? The flu immunity is temporary. She has antibodies and it's extremely likely it offers her protection from the virus.
1312080968228904960 2020-10-03 01:24:14 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao.
1312070421659840514 2020-10-03 00:42:20 +0800 <Camelback71> He knows your silly cloth mask doesn't work.
1312070110996168704 2020-10-03 00:41:06 +0800 <Camelback71> Liberal Jews pray?
1312069946218737665 2020-10-03 00:40:26 +0800 <Camelback71> Maybe because they're based on incomplete, and in some cases, bogus science.
1312069702227640320 2020-10-03 00:39:28 +0800 <Camelback71> Anyone working in a media building on 6th Avenue fails up, not down.
1312069325293977601 2020-10-03 00:37:58 +0800 <Camelback71> @fenixash8 They truly have no self-awareness. None.
1312064028986896386 2020-10-03 00:16:56 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos Placebos don't get more powerful!
1312063811864588290 2020-10-03 00:16:04 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist I should retweet your shit today.  Save me time and brain cells.  That being said I can't wait till that vagina with glasses Scott Adams opines today.
1312061927720251393 2020-10-03 00:08:35 +0800 <Camelback71> Don't cloth masks work?
1312061636052623360 2020-10-03 00:07:25 +0800 <Camelback71> @zones2surf Exactly.
1312061024715956225 2020-10-03 00:04:59 +0800 <Camelback71> She's not buying the hysteria you and your Never Trump colleagues are pushing.
1312059984407011329 2020-10-03 00:00:51 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried What's laughable is that Nolte has been lecturing all of us about how shitty the media has become the last 10 years and yet, now, in 2020 he's buying every anti-Trump narrative out there instead of countering it.  For crying out loud, the guy thinks cloth masks actually work.
1312057964627324928 2020-10-02 23:52:50 +0800 <Camelback71> @zones2surf I wasn't.  The guy's germophobe hermit.
1312057558828425216 2020-10-02 23:51:13 +0800 <Camelback71> Fauci isn't "top people".  He's been exposed as a fraud and the President has rightly sidelined him.
1312052446798049284 2020-10-02 23:30:54 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao.
1312028904748584960 2020-10-02 21:57:21 +0800 <Camelback71> Good grief. He's got a 95% chance of surviving the virus even if he develops symptoms.
1312025735989620736 2020-10-02 21:44:46 +0800 <Camelback71> Notice no one inquires about the PCR test's cycle threshold?
1312013743061041153 2020-10-02 20:57:07 +0800 <Camelback71> I get that your stupid.
1312013641022017536 2020-10-02 20:56:42 +0800 <Camelback71> Fuck off.
1311991399013781505 2020-10-02 19:28:19 +0800 <Camelback71> Donald Trump isn't a Senator, Joe.
1311910041016885249 2020-10-02 14:05:02 +0800 <Camelback71> They aren't wearing masks in many European countries, you dope.
1311908905979580416 2020-10-02 14:00:31 +0800 <Camelback71> These people are trash.
1311882237185384448 2020-10-02 12:14:33 +0800 <Camelback71> Mentally ill Santa Claus.
1311868815999791106 2020-10-02 11:21:13 +0800 <Camelback71> Now he's done it 9 times. Who wants to go for 10?
1311868345923235840 2020-10-02 11:19:21 +0800 <Camelback71> Lowry is such a cuck. He damn well knows they'll be asking Trump the same question in another week. It will never end.
1311847824112283648 2020-10-02 09:57:48 +0800 <Camelback71> This might be the first dead infant these ghouls have ever actually shown remorse for.
1311815333359968257 2020-10-02 07:48:42 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried Does this biased crew count against the Real Clear aggregate?  It's garbage.
1311812075115679750 2020-10-02 07:35:45 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried Shock poll? Or trend?
1311809109818175488 2020-10-02 07:23:58 +0800 <Camelback71> Don't bitch about it to the public.  Tell your father to actually do something about online censorship.
1311803596699176960 2020-10-02 07:02:04 +0800 <Camelback71> @TrustThePlant A truly wretched piece of narcissism. His hot wife will take him to the cleaners in a few years.
1311782166599143425 2020-10-02 05:36:54 +0800 <Camelback71> But you'll vote for the guy who excused away a group that has literally laid waste to a number of American cities and killed a guy execution-style.  You're a hero!
1311781740613005313 2020-10-02 05:35:13 +0800 <Camelback71> I see you asked him some real hardball questions there Guy.
1311769577957670912 2020-10-02 04:46:53 +0800 <Camelback71> He concocted a Marxist poison pill, not some beautiful, delicious cake.
1311769236855877633 2020-10-02 04:45:32 +0800 <Camelback71> How dare you talk of Obama that way.
1311760072276492288 2020-10-02 04:09:07 +0800 <Camelback71> @HeritageAmeric6 Nah, I see plenty of idiots of the Caucasian flavor wearing them in cars. Mostly young, under 30.
1311759480191815681 2020-10-02 04:06:46 +0800 <Camelback71> What a vagina.
1311758072881188865 2020-10-02 04:01:10 +0800 <Camelback71> Your boss and colleagues the Daily Wire play the same games with conservatives.
1311757215531847680 2020-10-02 03:57:46 +0800 <Camelback71> I'd like to feel sorry for the folks in Chicago but hey, they vote for this idiocy.
1311752159365664768 2020-10-02 03:37:40 +0800 <Camelback71> Who in the Trump campaign is agreeing to this crap?
1311751143198867456 2020-10-02 03:33:38 +0800 <Camelback71> Kilmeade spent his last two shows defending Chris Wallace and beating the "white supremacist" narrative.  The guy literally hates his own audience but is more than willing to make a buck off you rubes.
1311721586630762496 2020-10-02 01:36:11 +0800 <Camelback71> @EricInfoTech Blasphemy!
1311717328195735552 2020-10-02 01:19:16 +0800 <Camelback71> Here it comes.  Expect to see more of this nonsense in the NE corridor as we slide into fall and winter.
1311706833711558657 2020-10-02 00:37:34 +0800 <Camelback71> What's their body count?
1311701389597319170 2020-10-02 00:15:56 +0800 <Camelback71> Good luck on that.
1311701307476987904 2020-10-02 00:15:36 +0800 <Camelback71> @JamesTHarris Really could care less about her opinions on Trump and the new SC pick considering she has done nothing to help lift the lockdowns here in Arizona and hold Ducey accountable for his tyranny.  You shouldn't give her a platform.
1311646518345003008 2020-10-01 20:37:53 +0800 <Camelback71> Apparently burning, looting and rioting in America's cities is a big starter for you.
1311646172126224386 2020-10-01 20:36:31 +0800 <Camelback71> Biden and "his" Democratic Party have given the green light to BLM and Antifa to riot, pillage, and burn up cities for the past 4 months and this ignorant turd is concerned about a group he hadn't heard of before Tuesday night.
1311643968057212930 2020-10-01 20:27:45 +0800 <Camelback71> You're not pro-life.
1311640626258038785 2020-10-01 20:14:29 +0800 <Camelback71> Hewitt is is such a mark. Eli Lake is by far the top stenographer for swamp creatures and the deep state.
1311534719972982784 2020-10-01 13:13:39 +0800 <Camelback71> Will he enforce the mask mandate?
1311529937057189889 2020-10-01 12:54:38 +0800 <Camelback71> It's always the end of the world with this tool.
1311495632440287232 2020-10-01 10:38:19 +0800 <Camelback71> I'm not buying any of this going forward after 2020.
1311458481254273024 2020-10-01 08:10:42 +0800 <Camelback71> @JimDelRey Very true and most of all them would be worthy contestants in the fugliest woman contest at Faber U.
1311457084714614784 2020-10-01 08:05:09 +0800 <Camelback71> Fox News daytime and weekends might as well be MSNBC at this point anyways.
1311455961685528576 2020-10-01 08:00:41 +0800 <Camelback71> Talk about white supremacy.
1311455320623837184 2020-10-01 07:58:08 +0800 <Camelback71> Facts won't trump the narrative at this point.
1311447567071404033 2020-10-01 07:27:20 +0800 <Camelback71> How can you expect anything less from the despicable and dishonest @ejmontini over at The Republic.
1311418355178516480 2020-10-01 05:31:15 +0800 <Camelback71> The press is running with a narrative that the Proud Boys are burning crosses, kidnapping blacks and holding Nuremberg-style rallies all over America.
1311416087838437388 2020-10-01 05:22:14 +0800 <Camelback71> @HZardoz Amen.
1311414579294015488 2020-10-01 05:16:15 +0800 <Camelback71> Fox News truly does hate its own viewers.
1311397523538374657 2020-10-01 04:08:28 +0800 <Camelback71> Thanks Chris Wallace.
1311389054227767297 2020-10-01 03:34:49 +0800 <Camelback71> The governor who has allowed Antifa and BLM to riot, loot and burn in her state's largest city would like you know who the real threat to her country is.
1311387786776199168 2020-10-01 03:29:47 +0800 <Camelback71> Lawrence Auster made this point over and over.  It definitely bears repeating.
1311362884522311682 2020-10-01 01:50:50 +0800 <Camelback71> After all of the rioting, looting, and burning up of American cities by BLM and Antifa for the last 4 months, the important thing to know is that Trump didn't denounce the Proud Boys at last night's debate.
1311361902895722496 2020-10-01 01:46:56 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao.  Sorry sweetheart, you won't be getting an apology from a scumbag like that guy.
1311341498575867904 2020-10-01 00:25:51 +0800 <Camelback71> I told ya. Turning the RNC into a bean counting, pandering showcase was a big mistake.
1311341095612297217 2020-10-01 00:24:15 +0800 <Camelback71> Tim Scott? Lmao
1311340484778954758 2020-10-01 00:21:49 +0800 <Camelback71> Because the Proud Boys aren't burning up America's cities, looting businesses, confronting people having dinner at a restaurant and causing hundreds of millions in damage.
1311339957785710602 2020-10-01 00:19:44 +0800 <Camelback71> This üëá
1311326357205336065 2020-09-30 23:25:41 +0800 <Camelback71> At the end of the day, pandering to racial gaslighters like Tim Scott is fool's errand. He was never going to have your back Mr. President @realDonaldTrump
1311309977852588034 2020-09-30 22:20:36 +0800 <Camelback71> @PaulZeise You can't stay out of the culture war wedge in 2020. And making Tax Day a federal holiday and ending routine male circumsision are clown show ideas.
1311308184024264705 2020-09-30 22:13:28 +0800 <Camelback71> The "president's protestors" burn down buildings, loot stores, attack unarmed Trump supporters, and cause hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to America's cities.
1311307439011102720 2020-09-30 22:10:31 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao.
1311305445819052032 2020-09-30 22:02:35 +0800 <Camelback71> I don't see a problem here.
1311305186061631488 2020-09-30 22:01:33 +0800 <Camelback71> Apparently Jake couldn't dig up any stock footage on the Proud Boys burning a cross or holding a Nuremberg torch lit rally.
1311296222720712707 2020-09-30 21:25:56 +0800 <Camelback71> "devastating" lmao.
1311294703585824769 2020-09-30 21:19:54 +0800 <Camelback71> He had one interesting idea. Other than that, he was a leftist clown.
1311291100938661888 2020-09-30 21:05:35 +0800 <Camelback71> Antifa and BLM are wrecking cities across the country and this pissant is worried about the Proud Boys.
1311194151396933633 2020-09-30 14:40:21 +0800 <Camelback71> Good God.
1311193969213104128 2020-09-30 14:39:37 +0800 <Camelback71> Buckley sullied his own memory and magazine by purging paleoconservatives in the late 1990s and kissing the ring of Bill Kristol and Co.
1311193434955235331 2020-09-30 14:37:30 +0800 <Camelback71> When I need expert political analysis on the American presidential election, I turn to some Oxford U. trust fund baby from Northern Ireland.
1311192404003749890 2020-09-30 14:33:24 +0800 <Camelback71> Yup.
1311166492461817856 2020-09-30 12:50:26 +0800 <Camelback71> @historical_rev Our date was actually sealed in 1964 with the passage of the Civil Rights Act and it's sister the 1965 Immigration Act.
1311162025469329409 2020-09-30 12:32:41 +0800 <Camelback71> Why are you a fan of his to begin with? He's gone full CNN batshit left since 2016.
1311161742781640704 2020-09-30 12:31:34 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried It's just his AWFL girl friends in NYC. He's full of it.
1311160912997351424 2020-09-30 12:28:16 +0800 <Camelback71> @NightmarEclipse The problem with GOP voters is that most of them are at church when Wallace turned Sunday mornings on Fox into CNN. The only time they see him on the channel is election night, State of the Union and nights like this.
1311160056482656256 2020-09-30 12:24:52 +0800 <Camelback71> @tfamilyfriend @SomeBitchIKnow That's the funny thing, Trump won on substantive points even with Mr. Candy Crowley making himself the story.
1311141881586229248 2020-09-30 11:12:39 +0800 <Camelback71> @kilmeade  https://t.co/KnE6g3ejMD
1311141535442898944 2020-09-30 11:11:16 +0800 <Camelback71> @blanarovich I get restricted on the retweets. No doubt I've been shadowbanned from showing up on anybody's Twitter feeds and threads if they don't follow me.
1311141169976336384 2020-09-30 11:09:49 +0800 <Camelback71> Expect to see this exact nonsense to be repeated ad nauseum till the weekend on Lefty Twitter, CNN and MSNBC.
1311131058562187265 2020-09-30 10:29:38 +0800 <Camelback71> It was cheap political theater based on a lie. Trump never denigrated the American soldiers buried in France.
1311128427726909442 2020-09-30 10:19:11 +0800 <Camelback71> Maybe because it's a non-issue.
1311126636683620353 2020-09-30 10:12:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Trump campaign made a big mistake agreeing to Wallace. He's making Candy Crowley look like Sean Hannity.
1311124498658148352 2020-09-30 10:03:34 +0800 <Camelback71> Another great answer from Trump on critical race theory. Biden just mumbling talking points from late '60s Haight-Ashbury.
1311123482285977601 2020-09-30 09:59:32 +0800 <Camelback71> Mic drop from Trump there on the riots. Best answer of the night.
1311122406979723265 2020-09-30 09:55:15 +0800 <Camelback71> Candy Wallace on full display there. Disgraceful.
1311121105101271040 2020-09-30 09:50:05 +0800 <Camelback71> Now Biden is just flat out lying. Manufacturing decreased in the first two years of Trump's presidency?
1311115696168824832 2020-09-30 09:28:35 +0800 <Camelback71> Biden had a pretty good China virus answer (it was mostly b.s.) but then Trump curb stomped anyways.
1311083002391191552 2020-09-30 07:18:41 +0800 <Camelback71> I'd like to demean the poor guy that wrote this but it's obvious he's psychologically damaged beyond repair after undergoing a Marxist struggle session with a truly despicable collection of criminals.
1311063050212929536 2020-09-30 05:59:24 +0800 <Camelback71> This is a bald-faced lie.  Arizona is not open. Restaurants are still at 50% occupancy and most schools are closed. And of course a majority of the bars and clubs in the State remain closed if they're not already closed down for good.
1311062488025243648 2020-09-30 05:57:10 +0800 <Camelback71> Test, test, test.  No science, science, science.
1311058339296505856 2020-09-30 05:40:41 +0800 <Camelback71> @BringBackPapa Probably getting those teeth of his bleached for the 999th time.  His brain is already been bleached that many times and then some.
1311056879242502144 2020-09-30 05:34:52 +0800 <Camelback71> America, 2020: The 1964 Civil Rights Act was supposed to be the fulfillment of the promise of the Declaration and Civil War Amendments. Instead it was transformed into a racial poison pill that, along with the 1965 Immigration Act, is now destroying the historic American nation.
1311055155349958657 2020-09-30 05:28:01 +0800 <Camelback71> @RyanGirdusky Fusionism is dead.  It died the day Buckley threw paleoconservatives under the bus and allowed neoconservatives to throw social conservatives to the back of the bus.  It just took damn long for GOP voters to see they were being conned by a cabal of globalists.
1311054260973391873 2020-09-30 05:24:28 +0800 <Camelback71> @NNJ_Taxman Damn, Perino is a pygmie.
1311030506398429184 2020-09-30 03:50:05 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried She's gone completely negative.  Kelly is getting pounded for the conduct of his grifting government-propped up businesses.  His entire campaign is "McSally took away pre-existing conditions coverage with her Obamacare votes."
1311029588340826113 2020-09-30 03:46:26 +0800 <Camelback71> A pure flat tax wouldn't work and could be even more regressive than the current code.  A 3 rate system, with no loopholes and only deductions for kids and home mortgages, would work best.  But future Congresses would never leave it alone.  Repeal the 16th.
1310968106739666944 2020-09-29 23:42:07 +0800 <Camelback71> @MotherRobinson3 I'm seeing more than a few whispers about that in my timeline.
1310967426893275136 2020-09-29 23:39:25 +0800 <Camelback71> Say what you will about Trump and his team, if this was Rubio and the usual cast of Con Inc. consultants they'd never be this thorough. They'd let Biden get away with 3, 4, 5 breaks, an ear piece and getting the questions beforehand.
1310934751046328321 2020-09-29 21:29:35 +0800 <Camelback71> @NightmarEclipse The actors they find to play the serial killers are spot on.
1310933953889533953 2020-09-29 21:26:25 +0800 <Camelback71> Cindy McCain represents a "diversity of ideology"? Lmao.
1310906978902794240 2020-09-29 19:39:13 +0800 <Camelback71> Criticizing a nominal but phony lapsed Catholic for quitely parading around as a practicing Catholic isn't being anti-Catholic.
1310905526386008064 2020-09-29 19:33:27 +0800 <Camelback71> The sooner Redfield and Fauci are fired the better. The virus has exposed both as bureaucratic quacks.
1310904366757326848 2020-09-29 19:28:51 +0800 <Camelback71> Masks aren't vital. And neither is social distancing.
1310902810091745280 2020-09-29 19:22:39 +0800 <Camelback71> Murray is coming to the realization that our country is knee deep in a cancerous Chinese-style cultural revolution.
1310823840193232897 2020-09-29 14:08:52 +0800 <Camelback71> And the taxpayer won't be paying for it.
1310823661339901953 2020-09-29 14:08:09 +0800 <Camelback71> Too bad. I hear lemonade stands are quite profitable.
1310797159759900673 2020-09-29 12:22:50 +0800 <Camelback71> Must read thread. üëá
1310739531876823040 2020-09-29 08:33:51 +0800 <Camelback71> I'm guessing Fauci may resign any day now. He doesn't like playing second fiddle, especially to a guy who's making him look like the quack he is.
1310720340075528193 2020-09-29 07:17:35 +0800 <Camelback71> Virginia is deep blue at this point.  It turned the corner 20 years ago as government got bigger and bigger and Central American legal immigrants flooded into DC and the Virginia suburbs.
1310719336739344385 2020-09-29 07:13:36 +0800 <Camelback71> @hoipcentral India's revolt against the British wasn't all peace signs and sit-ins.  There was violence in some areas.  The story of Indian independence is really grounded in British restraint as you describe it.
1310718203983572992 2020-09-29 07:09:06 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried Is the Z Man interview up yet?  Inquiring minds want to know.
1310717990480961536 2020-09-29 07:08:15 +0800 <Camelback71> I'm pretty sure most of America will.
1310717467346440192 2020-09-29 07:06:10 +0800 <Camelback71> It's an annual income tax @elviadiaz.  It's not an annual tax on wealthy people simply for being wealthy.
1310712730312216577 2020-09-29 06:47:21 +0800 <Camelback71> I liked it when I never knew Jeff Daniels wasn't an ignorant, pompous ass.

1310109889331515394 2020-09-27 14:51:52 +0800 <Camelback71> It's not inappropriate when Redfield was deliberately misstating the science and misinforming the public at the same time.
1310108865430581248 2020-09-27 14:47:48 +0800 <Camelback71> @tfamilyfriend It's lame and a bit cringe. But should she be confirmed it would be one of best "trigger the libs at the restaurant" trinkets out there.
1310108366371389442 2020-09-27 14:45:49 +0800 <Camelback71> So they're satisfied with "Trump owning the libs" and that's it. You may be right but let's not kid ourselves 2020 Trump is actually acknowledging this demographic in his reelection bid.
1310107466642812928 2020-09-27 14:42:15 +0800 <Camelback71> I should hope not.

1310101702620528641 2020-09-27 14:19:21 +0800 <Camelback71> That's not his point. Girdusky is simply pointing out that as it stands now, Trump is doing nothing to motivate this shy demographic. He's taking them for granted. And it's liable to be the reason he loses.

1310088201684439040 2020-09-27 13:25:42 +0800 <Camelback71> Of course they wouldn't take up the challenge, they'd all have to sign on to an opinion upholding Kennedy's awful majority opinion.
1310085321288069120 2020-09-27 13:14:15 +0800 <Camelback71> Precedent? Kennedy's opinion is one of the most pernicious uses of substantive due process in the history of the court alongside Roe and Griswold.

1310027763445723136 2020-09-27 09:25:32 +0800 <Camelback71> Lincoln was not a conservative.

1310026891621855233 2020-09-27 09:22:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Sweetheart, your dad takes are as worn as a Walmart semi's tires.

1309997260512456704 2020-09-27 07:24:20 +0800 <Camelback71> @NightmarEclipse It's starting to become very predictable. Romney is going to sabotage this nomination. Bank on it.

1309939553168322561 2020-09-27 03:35:01 +0800 <Camelback71> It took less than a few hours to bury the most famous Jew that ever lived. We're now at 7 days and counting for Ginsburg.
1309903036421033984 2020-09-27 01:09:55 +0800 <Camelback71> Trump could be campaigning on H1B visa restrictions and increasing his share of the White college-educated male vote but instead we get pandering to voting blocs that will do nothing to help him win in the Rust Belt.
1309892473997504512 2020-09-27 00:27:57 +0800 <Camelback71> Regrettably, modern day Presidents and Congresses have not ignored these abuses.

1309886543624982536 2020-09-27 00:04:23 +0800 <Camelback71> @MotherRobinson3 I say that as someone who will reluctantly vote for the guy but don't try to kid yourself he's followed through on most of his 2016 agenda.
1309885671666933760 2020-09-27 00:00:55 +0800 <Camelback71> @tonib The most entertaining criticism comes from the Canucks.   My standard reply is that "nobody who decided to suckle a monarch's nip for another 200 years has any business bitching about anybody."
1309756621027856384 2020-09-26 15:28:07 +0800 <Camelback71> She simply said the case was precedent. Bork said something similar at his hearing. But that doesn't mean she wouldn't overturn it as Bork would have.

Flag burnings, free abortions, annual public confessions of white guilt, and to top off the evening, screenings of Cuties on the Washington Mall.
1309694666585956355 2020-09-26 11:21:56 +0800 <Camelback71> Within hours of Roe being struck down, every deep blue state in the Union along with a few purple ones will pass abortion on demand laws. It really isn't the end of civilization for you baby killers.

1309642287933054976 2020-09-26 07:53:48 +0800 <Camelback71> @CottoGottfried If given the opportunity, she'd vote for across-the-board amnesty and hasn't, to my knowledge, lifted a finger or signaled her support of Trump's tariffs during his term.  I'd hardly call her a good senator.
1309640516573650944 2020-09-26 07:46:45 +0800 <Camelback71> @zones2surf @julie_kelly2 @Barnes_Law Many dissidents are worried about her immigration jurisprudence.  I am to an extent.  But her views on this issue will only be tested if Trump remains President.
1309640112238518273 2020-09-26 07:45:09 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos I do believe the current boyfriend did have a conceal carry permit (not that it matters) and supposedly 11 other people denied the cops made their presence known.  I tend to believe the cops.  I'm going to guess most of these 11 were either asleep or interviewed well after
1309638309124034560 2020-09-26 07:37:59 +0800 <Camelback71> @zones2surf @julie_kelly2 @Barnes_Law Don't get all bent out of shape by the opinions of Barnes.  He's the Bill Mitchell and Seb Gorka of MAGA lawyers.  He's even worse than the Ben Shapiro of normie Con lawyers -Coleman and that's saying something.
1309628932434477056 2020-09-26 07:00:43 +0800 <Camelback71> @VDAREJamesK Fair point.  And one I can agree with.  Question is will any Republican Senator ask her the question directly?  I doubt it.

1309594692695109632 2020-09-26 04:44:40 +0800 <Camelback71> A Supreme Court nominee isn't able to cut them a stimulus check.  For crying out loud, are dissidents thinking the Supreme Court is going to strike down Hart-Cellar? Or lower the number of visas issued?
1309593413285675009 2020-09-26 04:39:35 +0800 <Camelback71> The correct answer is "It doesn't exist. Next?"
1309587872689696768 2020-09-26 04:17:34 +0800 <Camelback71> @FlyGalAZ @grownwildinaz There's also the question of who's rubbing who's back here?  Is the City using the universities or the universities using the City? The whole damn thing stinks of a modern day meeting of the ComIntern with Lenin and Stalin.
1309586198843789324 2020-09-26 04:10:55 +0800 <Camelback71> Overturning Roe isn't based on some Papal edict.
1309573875152441346 2020-09-26 03:21:57 +0800 <Camelback71> It only lasts as long as Trump is President.

1309567274596986880 2020-09-26 02:55:43 +0800 <Camelback71> Why demographics matter.
1309566982765780998 2020-09-26 02:54:33 +0800 <Camelback71> @JanKezen The fact is she had a horrible taste in boyfriends, may have been a criminal herself, and it unfortunately got her killed. There isn't a jury out there who'd convict a cop or cops on the evidence available.
1309564212553764864 2020-09-26 02:43:33 +0800 <Camelback71> @sunnyright The buck stops with the judge.  And the brass most likely approved of the application, not the rank-and-file cop who executed it.  It was a tragic outcome but justice doesn't entail prosecuting the officers who executed the warrant.
1309561894844338176 2020-09-26 02:34:20 +0800 <Camelback71> That's not the police's fault.  It's the judge's fault.

1309521746458894336 2020-09-25 23:54:48 +0800 <Camelback71> Sweetheart, the poll numbers at this point say otherwise.  They are going somewhere.  Many in fact will stay home.

1309313095253127168 2020-09-25 10:05:42 +0800 <Camelback71> The State is flush with millions in Covid cash. Are we spending it help people and businesses who are being crushed by the lockdowns and mandates? Nope. We're spending it on this nonsense.
1309312361321254912 2020-09-25 10:02:47 +0800 <Camelback71> It won't be anything of the sort unless somebody actually goes to jail.
1309275159119818752 2020-09-25 07:34:57 +0800 <Camelback71> Apparently the police were supposed to know Taylor had been two-timing her drug dealing boyfriend.

1309128039268265991 2020-09-24 21:50:21 +0800 <Camelback71> Of course we get this predictable cucking from a guy who supported the rolling coup from day one in the op-ed pages of NY Times.

1309120615115259904 2020-09-24 21:20:51 +0800 <Camelback71> The Democrats have been running a rolling coup since 2020. A coup aided and abetted by commentators like you.

1309119309353029634 2020-09-24 21:15:40 +0800 <Camelback71> The Democrats have been engaged in sedition since November 2016, are literally rigging this election in broad daylight and this useless nepot is concerned about Trump.

1308948288767365120 2020-09-24 09:56:05 +0800 <Camelback71> @NightmarEclipse Chambers always had the best read on those subversives. If you weren't openly breaking with Stalin after the purges, you were at best a useful idiot furthering the cause of Soviet Union and at worst a conscious subversive.
1308911502313783296 2020-09-24 07:29:55 +0800 <Camelback71> Cry somewhere else.
1308911346344439809 2020-09-24 07:29:18 +0800 <Camelback71> He's talking about post-election day ballot harvesting which has now been given sanction by MN, WI, PA and MI.  And he has every right to challenge those reservoirs of fraud.
1308910971629568006 2020-09-24 07:27:48 +0800 <Camelback71> Hardly.  PA, MI, WI, MN and the two largest counties in AZ have explicitly opened the floodgates to post-election ballot harvesting.

1308842393295360003 2020-09-24 02:55:18 +0800 <Camelback71> With what majority?
1308841067454894086 2020-09-24 02:50:02 +0800 <Camelback71> Hat tip to conservatives:  Buy and read Gordon Wood's excellent Empire of Liberty which covers the same exact subject matter. Don't reward a grifting fraudster like Lynne Cheney.
1308837898297409536 2020-09-24 02:37:26 +0800 <Camelback71> If Stalin hasn't called up the Checka and had their rifles loaded, that's how you know he made the wrong decision.
1308820335219728384 2020-09-24 01:27:39 +0800 <Camelback71> More panic porn this morning from PA.  When did they occur?  Were they previously classified as something else? Release the redacted death certificates.
1308819818703855617 2020-09-24 01:25:36 +0800 <Camelback71> Totally insane.
1308819281606369281 2020-09-24 01:23:28 +0800 <Camelback71> @OneFineJay @BigJebBos I think quite a bit of this is tort-related.  Scottsdale where I live has lifted their mask mandate but Maricopa County has not.  They appear to be worried about possible litigation related to any relaxing of the virus mitigation mandates and restrictions on large gatherings.
1308816544646881280 2020-09-24 01:12:35 +0800 <Camelback71> @OneFineJay @BigJebBos Unfortunately, many states, including red ones, continue to use PCR tests as the measuring stick of the pandemic because of college students.  It's ridiculous.  You've got college students with no symptoms being tested on a regular basis with PCR tests up 40pcr cycles.
1308814499399438336 2020-09-24 01:04:27 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos Bingo.  And Fauci goes on to dismiss T-cell cross reactivity immunity which is what you describe.  He's a political fraud of the first order.
1308813830282260481 2020-09-24 01:01:48 +0800 <Camelback71> Fauci doesn't even know or now deliberately ignores his own discipline anymore.
1308810111062736899 2020-09-24 00:47:01 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos Why does conservative media think they even have a voice outside Twitter and Fox News?  Nobody who works north of the Fox News headquarters on 6th Avenue pays any attention to conservative media criticism or Democrat scandals.
1308808315313352704 2020-09-24 00:39:53 +0800 <Camelback71> Doesn't matter how noble the law's intent is (and that's debatable).  If its intent infringes on an employer's religious liberty as guaranteed by the 1st Amendment, it's unconstitutional.
1308807693641998337 2020-09-24 00:37:25 +0800 <Camelback71> No employer is denying an employee universal access to contraception.  An employee can always go out, on their own, and purchase coverage if the employer refuses to include it in their health package.
1308806185043111936 2020-09-24 00:31:25 +0800 <Camelback71> The only thing correct about this tweet is that BLM is the most flagrantly racist organization in America.  The rest is blame-shifting dressed as half-truths.
1308776466692276226 2020-09-23 22:33:20 +0800 <Camelback71> The key to these polls is the White vote. Trump needs to zero in on issues of concern to the working class and middle class whites: Lockdown relief, immigration and trade.
1308737763668156417 2020-09-23 19:59:32 +0800 <Camelback71> I almost care what two former insignificant members of the House of Windsor has to say. Almost.
1308736185880047616 2020-09-23 19:53:16 +0800 <Camelback71> @InfernalAcorn Saskatchewan too.
1308733262425026560 2020-09-23 19:41:39 +0800 <Camelback71> Nonsense. There were constant operations against the South everywhere since the beginning of the War. In the end, it was the absolute numbers of the North and the North's willingness to use them that exhausted the South. I admire Grant. He was no Lee.
1308651585866612737 2020-09-23 14:17:06 +0800 <Camelback71> This isn't your country.
1308650870939291649 2020-09-23 14:14:15 +0800 <Camelback71> She's an improvement on Herman Cain and a whole handful of black Republican grifters who came before her. But somebody convince me this doesn't smell like angling for a gig at Fox News and she really has a chance in November. I just don't see it.
1308649470817492992 2020-09-23 14:08:42 +0800 <Camelback71> @VDAREJamesK He won't win Arizona. I live here. The talk radio hacks in Phoenix and Tucson are choosing to live in a bubble when it comes to Trump and the polls. I'm certain the polls are off but Trump is still behind and I'm just not seeing where he improves on 2018.
1308648313449709568 2020-09-23 14:04:06 +0800 <Camelback71> And? He was.
1308613451548225536 2020-09-23 11:45:34 +0800 <Camelback71> Your husband was an awful, spiteful human being.

1308598298689716224 2020-09-23 10:45:21 +0800 <Camelback71> @demontage2000 It's worse than that. I'd be willing to bet up to 40,000 of these cases involve 30+pcr cycle results. Which means many they don't even have the virus at present.
1308596193400819712 2020-09-23 10:36:59 +0800 <Camelback71> They don't care.
1308580043895894017 2020-09-23 09:32:49 +0800 <Camelback71> The comments are entertaining.

1308547718726344704 2020-09-23 07:24:22 +0800 <Camelback71> @VDAREJamesK I ask myself what movies from this era will we be celebrating 25 years from now other than Nolan's The Dark Knight?  The answer is 0.  America's decaying monoculture ended in the mid-1990s.
1308546895787167744 2020-09-23 07:21:06 +0800 <Camelback71> Remember this is the guy who thinks Christianity is nothing more than bastardized form of Judaism.
1308546069249179649 2020-09-23 07:17:49 +0800 <Camelback71> Will is just another in a long line of frauds that used the conservative movement to peddle himself as some sort of intellectual. The last 10 years has exposed him as nothing more than pretentious, cosmopolitan ass with the intellect of a 10th grade civics teacher.
1308505249385123840 2020-09-23 04:35:36 +0800 <Camelback71> I did not need to see this. üò≥

1308472324870471685 2020-09-23 02:24:47 +0800 <Camelback71> @demontage2000 This is disturbing. I'm beginning to think I'm going to need to live in a hut in the Rockies to enjoy my retirement.  Either that or move to Hungary.
1308467623433105408 2020-09-23 02:06:06 +0800 <Camelback71> @ScottMGreer Indeed.  And she's too dumb to realize that unless she goes to work for Hobby Lobby, her "right to birth control" isn't threatened.
1308461422804836352 2020-09-23 01:41:27 +0800 <Camelback71> I like Bade but its apparent after reading this some conservatives simply do not want to overturn Roe.
1308456942205984768 2020-09-23 01:23:39 +0800 <Camelback71> Norway, Denmark and Finland did not send their nursing home Covid patients back into nursing homes.  Sweden did. That's the only difference.  The virus lingered longer in the other Nordic countries because they locked down.
1308456531059376129 2020-09-23 01:22:01 +0800 <Camelback71> That's nonsense.  They had lower deaths per capita because they didn't send their old people back to nursing homes and the virus lingered longer in both places because they didn't reach reach 20-25% seroprevalance because of lockdowns.
1308454784119128066 2020-09-23 01:15:05 +0800 <Camelback71> Well, they haven't yet reached accusing her of participating in a gang bang. But they're getting there.  https://t.co/nC0EgL3lQy

1308431887447150593 2020-09-22 23:44:06 +0800 <Camelback71> No amount of involvement of Republicans and conservatives is going to change the facts of Arizona's demographics. McSally needs to talk legal immigration reform and China virus relief for working families but she's not.
1308430229216526336 2020-09-22 23:37:30 +0800 <Camelback71> The Democrat members of the Court (they're not Justices) destroyed the legitimacy of the body over 30 years ago.
1308292128527626240 2020-09-22 14:28:44 +0800 <Camelback71> Well, Lincoln did ignore Dred Scot.
1308291316959256576 2020-09-22 14:25:31 +0800 <Camelback71> There appears to be acottage industry of modern day "historians" who get their kicks armchair quarterbacking the Civil War, holding military tribunals declaring Southern generals war criminals or something and slandering their descendants.
1308290609669570561 2020-09-22 14:22:42 +0800 <Camelback71> Grant's solid strategy was simply overwhelming Lee with numbers as Lincoln expected him to do. Not exactly novel.
1308288342388162560 2020-09-22 14:13:42 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao. Robert E. Lee had such a poor grasp of the strategic picture and was such a mediocre commander Lincoln had to suffer through five generals before he could find one that could best Lee.
1308259975521693698 2020-09-22 12:20:59 +0800 <Camelback71> @oblivious_guy @barefootboomer He talks of the North as some monolith of Whig enlightenment. For every Emerson and Thoreau, there was a Whitman. And for every principled Whig objection to the M-A war, there was the greed of New England Whig capitalists who were always looking East, not West.
1308254625447854080 2020-09-22 11:59:43 +0800 <Camelback71> @barefootboomer @oblivious_guy The Southern States were the US...in 1846-1848. They weren't the Confederacy.
1308254191232536576 2020-09-22 11:58:00 +0800 <Camelback71> This is utter nonsense. The Northern Whigs were hypocrites of the highest order. Opposing the war, then funding it once started, bragging upon its successful outcome and then turning around and nominating Zachary Taylor for President.
1308226105057271808 2020-09-22 10:06:23 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist @fenixash8 It's turning out to be not so much of a hard luck case.

1308213754862084096 2020-09-22 09:17:19 +0800 <Camelback71> @oblivious_guy I do enjoy reading all these armchair, Nuremberg-style proclamations of that the "traitorous" Robert E. Lee.  It's amazing, though, how the North and even Northern veterans viewed Lee. No one of prominence, that I know of publicly, rebuked Lincoln's decision to pardon him.
1308172971706441728 2020-09-22 06:35:15 +0800 <Camelback71> The surrender caucus in "conservative" media is practically begging the Senate GOP to give up.

1308168801502986241 2020-09-22 06:18:41 +0800 <Camelback71> Democrats at present don't even have a seat at the poker table, let alone hold any cards.  Why give them even chance to even see a pocket pair?
1308164657874481153 2020-09-22 06:02:13 +0800 <Camelback71> @black_dog_1776 Quite frankly, it's time we get assurances from any potential nominee that they will overturn Roe and provide answers on a number of other sticky cultural issues that might come before the Court.  I'm sick of seeing conservatives get on the Court and turn on into Leftists.

1308142871724224516 2020-09-22 04:35:39 +0800 <Camelback71> Don't be fooled.  These votes tell you quite a bit about who the Democrats really have no qualms about and who they think is a danger to their ideology.
1308142255358631936 2020-09-22 04:33:12 +0800 <Camelback71> This is a distinction without a difference.  Manchin's support is predicated on Trump winning.  Should he lose, he'll continue to oppose to Inauguration.
1308141013773373445 2020-09-22 04:28:16 +0800 <Camelback71> This. Is. Not. Good.
1308139026155667456 2020-09-22 04:20:22 +0800 <Camelback71> Japan didn't help anybody bomb Pearl Harbor.  They bombed Pearl Harbor.  America didn't enter the war against the Nazis because of human rights violations and invading other countries.  It was only because Hitler declared war on America.
1308137353928568832 2020-09-22 04:13:43 +0800 <Camelback71> @oblivious_guy The best book I've read (actually recently) about the run-up to the Second World War, which provides a much needed new prospective is Pat Buchanan's Churchill, Hitler and Unnecessary War.
1308124920145088515 2020-09-22 03:24:19 +0800 <Camelback71> Nonsense.  Lagoa is a Bush puppet and she won't overturn Roe.

1308082295752945665 2020-09-22 00:34:56 +0800 <Camelback71> Both O'Connor and Ginsburg were "huge glass ceiling breaker[s] for all women."  And both declined to protect the unborn and upheld Roe and the pernicious use of substantive due process.  Nobody's daughter should look to these two as judicial role models.

1307909567943028738 2020-09-21 13:08:35 +0800 <Camelback71> A prosecutor can get a grand jury to declare a cheeseburger filet mignon. You're garbage.

1307826160676425729 2020-09-21 07:37:09 +0800 <Camelback71> @poolboy88 Our system isn't based strictly in English common law.
1307825915892649985 2020-09-21 07:36:11 +0800 <Camelback71> Barbara Logoa is John Roberts in a skirt.
1307825371467792385 2020-09-21 07:34:01 +0800 <Camelback71> @poolboy88 Bork never shied away from his views on high profile cases even in his lower court confirmation hearings. And a lower court judges have defied Supreme Court rulings numerous times in our history.
1307824713364729858 2020-09-21 07:31:24 +0800 <Camelback71> @elaphos_ @BigJebBos Casey needs dismantled because it's bulit on Brennan's substantive due process rationale. This issue needs to be completely in the hands of state legislatures.

1307823760808898561 2020-09-21 07:27:37 +0800 <Camelback71> @elaphos_ @BigJebBos It isn't meaningless. And we need a Senator to ask her point blank in any hearings whether the nominee will consider Roe "stare decisis". If  they do, they're done
1307823149455568897 2020-09-21 07:25:11 +0800 <Camelback71> @128picklepie1 Amy Coney Barrett.
1307822677772525569 2020-09-21 07:23:19 +0800 <Camelback71> She is still awful.
1307821979156635648 2020-09-21 07:20:32 +0800 <Camelback71> Utter nonsense. Bork speculated on doing exactly that. And every judge SHOULD be very clear on Roe. Period.
1307818691233366016 2020-09-21 07:07:28 +0800 <Camelback71> You're idea of pluralism isn't the pluralism of the historic American nation. It's a multicultural suicide pill.
1307818137107099648 2020-09-21 07:05:16 +0800 <Camelback71> @thebesteno I'm not looking for "reasonable judge" - a leftist. I'm looking for the second coming of Bork or Scalia.
1307817415846232064 2020-09-21 07:02:24 +0800 <Camelback71> Lagoa would be awful.
1307816711572209664 2020-09-21 06:59:36 +0800 <Camelback71> A lot of conservatives are very ignorant of constitutional law, stare decisis and Roe.
1307816335053697024 2020-09-21 06:58:06 +0800 <Camelback71> Yes, they can. That's how rulings get to the Supreme Court.
1307816049564237825 2020-09-21 06:56:58 +0800 <Camelback71> This is a cop-out.

1307815081657344000 2020-09-21 06:53:08 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, she's awful.  https://t.co/2bQLWZfsPJ

1307813744827756545 2020-09-21 06:47:49 +0800 <Camelback71> This clown predicts "opportunistic attacks on the sacred constitution and the identity of the nation" because of a new conservative Justice just as Democrats are threatening Court packing, making more States and abolishing the Electoral College. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1307812894436777984 2020-09-21 06:44:26 +0800 <Camelback71> If only...
1307734197021282304 2020-09-21 01:31:43 +0800 <Camelback71> "Fundamental change"
1307710631244476416 2020-09-20 23:58:05 +0800 <Camelback71> That's all conservatives have been doing for 40 years. It hasn't changed anything.
1307710433088864256 2020-09-20 23:57:17 +0800 <Camelback71> We've played the incremental game for 40 years. Where has that gotten conservatives? Roe is still law, gay marriage is a right, and legal immigration is turning GOP states blue.
1307709923644510208 2020-09-20 23:55:16 +0800 <Camelback71> @tfamilyfriend If you are over 70, have diabetes or are morbidly obese, be my guest and wear a mask. But the rest of the population isn't obligated to give these people some sort of comfort by continually wearing a useless mask because the virus is still out there.
1307708564710932481 2020-09-20 23:49:52 +0800 <Camelback71> Then why are there mask mandates?
1307707209552261121 2020-09-20 23:44:29 +0800 <Camelback71> And she was one of Reagan's biggest mistakes.
1307696447677112322 2020-09-20 23:01:43 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin I understand she didn't say she wouldn't given the opportunity. The new medical facts have nothing to do with it. That's for the state legislatures. We're talking substantive due process and scrapping Roe's "right to privacy" which has no constitutio basis. I'm not sure she will.
1307681354826481667 2020-09-20 22:01:45 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin Do you support her?   "I think it is very unlikely at this point that the court is going to overturn Roe [v. Wade], or Roe [v. Wade] as curbed by [Planned Parenthood v.] Casey. The fundamental element, that the woman has a right to choose abortion, will probably stand." -ACB
1307673590007910401 2020-09-20 21:30:53 +0800 <Camelback71> Actually we're not. America's problem is that it is too racially and ethnically diverse.
1307668390849306624 2020-09-20 21:10:14 +0800 <Camelback71> Democrats are holding a gun to the norms of America's constitutional order. There's a deal to be made!
1307667854691414017 2020-09-20 21:08:06 +0800 <Camelback71> If you said something similar you're an idiot.
1307553017474854912 2020-09-20 13:31:47 +0800 <Camelback71> If Cory Gardner punts on the Trump's pick, he's toast as far as reelection. Translation: He'd rather lose than possibly have his fingerprints on a SC justice who will vote to throw out Roe.
1307551636986818560 2020-09-20 13:26:18 +0800 <Camelback71> O'Connor and Kennedy are neck-and-neck for Reagan's biggest mistake.
1307532959180701699 2020-09-20 12:12:04 +0800 <Camelback71> They nominated a senile puppet.
1307532725675372547 2020-09-20 12:11:09 +0800 <Camelback71> He *believes* in all this but loves seeing abortion legal, wouldn't object to an assault weapons ban, and would object abolishing scores of federal agencies.
1307527868021239810 2020-09-20 11:51:51 +0800 <Camelback71> @TheCptBlackPill This is very true. It's one of the many reasons I can't stand normie blowhards repeating ad nauseum D'Souza's perverted, politicized history of the political parties. Both parties were race realists but only one had to live with the majority of the freed slaves.
1307496875545645058 2020-09-20 09:48:41 +0800 <Camelback71> "we Republicans"? If you're a Republican so was Ted Kennedy.

1307459543593398273 2020-09-20 07:20:21 +0800 <Camelback71> @IvoryJingoist I'm fine if your pro-choice but the issue is the federal constitutional right to abortion. The issue rightly belongs in state legislatures. But most of these folks don't care about the Constitution and are fine with the status quo.
1307457787237023744 2020-09-20 07:13:22 +0800 <Camelback71> Uncomfortable truths exposed by RBG's death. 1. Ann Coulter is pro-choice, always has been. 2. Most cons with blue checkmarks are pro-choice. 3. Quite a few dissidents are pro-choice.
1307456648735158272 2020-09-20 07:08:51 +0800 <Camelback71> @AshLikeSnow17 I'll switch 1 @ 2. I think Coulter is out in left field on ACB. Quite frankly, I think Ann is pro-choice and can't stand an *actual* judge that will vote to overturn Roe.
1307449333063663617 2020-09-20 06:39:46 +0800 <Camelback71> She wasn't much an inspiration to the unborn.
1307433424982929408 2020-09-20 05:36:34 +0800 <Camelback71> Because Velshi decided to make himself part of story.
1307425396153970688 2020-09-20 05:04:39 +0800 <Camelback71> This is utter horseshit.
1307425017597059073 2020-09-20 05:03:09 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos I'm beginning to think if a conservative or a Republican has a blue check they aren't really conservative or vote Republican.
1307424184239157248 2020-09-20 04:59:50 +0800 <Camelback71> Thank God you're not Trump.
1307378103908327425 2020-09-20 01:56:44 +0800 <Camelback71> We get it Scott, you're pro-choice.
1307377841118437376 2020-09-20 01:55:41 +0800 <Camelback71> Dems have powerful weapons like lies, slander, libel, blackmail, and, ultimately, violence.
1307376646383480832 2020-09-20 01:50:57 +0800 <Camelback71> @TheCptBlackPill I hope she has a therapist.
1307374110578679809 2020-09-20 01:40:52 +0800 <Camelback71> Center-right means moderate pro choicer. Ya, pass on that.
1307373714153959424 2020-09-20 01:39:17 +0800 <Camelback71> A moderate is no better than an outright liberal. After Gorsuch's bullshit ruling on trannies, a moderate will depress the base.
1307373092306481152 2020-09-20 01:36:49 +0800 <Camelback71> This isn't about bean counting. It's about overturning Roe v. Wade. The fact is Lagoa is no sure thing to vote that way. ACB is.
1307335761226653696 2020-09-19 23:08:29 +0800 <Camelback71> Priceless.
1307334675258462208 2020-09-19 23:04:10 +0800 <Camelback71> Supposed conservative Republican celebrates the life of a champion of abortion rights and gay marriage.
1307332380261187585 2020-09-19 22:55:03 +0800 <Camelback71> They will. Dumb idea.
1307331204220239872 2020-09-19 22:50:22 +0800 <Camelback71> They're anti-American ideas.

1307323017454788610 2020-09-19 22:17:50 +0800 <Camelback71> @EmeraldRobinson Quite frankly, after Bostock, how does anyone trust Gorsuch?
1307321961240915968 2020-09-19 22:13:39 +0800 <Camelback71> We're still waiting on all these Durham indictments you keep promising.
1307307146694987776 2020-09-19 21:14:47 +0800 <Camelback71> @DavidPDuffy25 I figure a clerk for Thurgood Marshall is due for a spin.
1307207183289917446 2020-09-19 14:37:33 +0800 <Camelback71> She voted consistently uphold Roe and helped invent rights out of whole cloth with no constitutional basis. She's not some great American patriot.
1307206594497662976 2020-09-19 14:35:13 +0800 <Camelback71> Who's next? Ted Kennedy?
1307199943392722944 2020-09-19 14:08:47 +0800 <Camelback71> @AnnCoulter Her quote here Ann appears to refer only to trial judges, not appellate judges. Am I reading that wrong?
1307198688171761664 2020-09-19 14:03:48 +0800 <Camelback71> We don't care.
1307198200726519808 2020-09-19 14:01:52 +0800 <Camelback71> Justice Roberts doesn't get a vote here.
1307198074628894720 2020-09-19 14:01:22 +0800 <Camelback71> Correct. Full steam ahead.
1307197681912086529 2020-09-19 13:59:48 +0800 <Camelback71> Imagine believing, after Roe, Casey, Hardwick, Obergfell and Bostock, that the Court has some sort of "public legitimacy".
1307185411005935622 2020-09-19 13:11:02 +0800 <Camelback71> I'll be flying mine at full staff.
1307168327324692480 2020-09-19 12:03:09 +0800 <Camelback71> The Left is always leaving "instructions".
1307149870256381953 2020-09-19 10:49:49 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya. This isn't House of Cards. It's real life.
1307146834909954049 2020-09-19 10:37:45 +0800 <Camelback71> We were never under the impression you and your seditious friends didn't want to do this anyways.
1307142295934779392 2020-09-19 10:19:43 +0800 <Camelback71> @NightmarEclipse Sometimes I feel no need to comment on anything as long as I have your missives  Touche brother.
1307132660419002368 2020-09-19 09:41:26 +0800 <Camelback71> The last thing Trump should do is listen to this trust fund bimbo.
1307112555312304130 2020-09-19 08:21:32 +0800 <Camelback71> It is.
1307111513203896324 2020-09-19 08:17:24 +0800 <Camelback71> No.
1307111406878306304 2020-09-19 08:16:59 +0800 <Camelback71> Actually it does.

1307105837098446851 2020-09-19 07:54:51 +0800 <Camelback71> Nobody cares.
1307103119113940994 2020-09-19 07:44:03 +0800 <Camelback71> Fuck that.
1307095981964623879 2020-09-19 07:15:41 +0800 <Camelback71> FDR's entire White House kitchen cabinet were Communists.     It was this cabal that handed over all of Eastern Europe to Stalin.
1307095346179342338 2020-09-19 07:13:09 +0800 <Camelback71> @LibertyAndTech I'm not sure they cared to fill the space of a defunct publication especially considering their benefactors were either the Koch brothers or Kristol's sugar daddy billionaire sponsor.

1307062664640765952 2020-09-19 05:03:17 +0800 <Camelback71> I too have a Masters Degree. It's worthless.  And running the CIA and NSA at anytime during the last 30 years is no resume enhancer.

1307049987386245121 2020-09-19 04:12:55 +0800 <Camelback71> @NNJ_Taxman @upstatefederlst Kind of hard to have a Japan first strategy when half of our naval vessels are either at the bottom of Pearl, getting totalled, others repaired or not even on the assembly line.
1307045330073124865 2020-09-19 03:54:25 +0800 <Camelback71> @NNJ_Taxman @upstatefederlst Ah, we didn't go to war against Germany until after Hitler declared war on us.

1307044471394250753 2020-09-19 03:51:00 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, fuck that. It's a thoroughly dishonest column
1307044331937767425 2020-09-19 03:50:27 +0800 <Camelback71> These pro-Biden confessionals penned by Never Trumpers are so dishonest as to insult one's intelligence.

1307019598705827840 2020-09-19 02:12:10 +0800 <Camelback71> @DarrenJBeattie I've said over and over again. There's not one current sitting Republican Senator whose on the voters side.
1307018254414540800 2020-09-19 02:06:49 +0800 <Camelback71> If you're a McCain or Bush Republican at this point, you're a Democrat.
1307009207921553409 2020-09-19 01:30:52 +0800 <Camelback71> I don't whose history is worse.  This chart or your interpretation of it.

1307007760047857666 2020-09-19 01:25:07 +0800 <Camelback71> @JamesTHarris Expected more of your interview of McSally. Nothing but softballs.
1306997473211084805 2020-09-19 00:44:15 +0800 <Camelback71> Biden literally called Trump a mass murderer last night.
1306996783646605312 2020-09-19 00:41:30 +0800 <Camelback71> @katydaqueen @yvonnewingett @FlyGalAZ @dougducey I'm all for recalling the tyrant but I also think it is important for this organization to point out the cowards in the legislature who have sat on their asses doing nothing to stop him.  They're part of the problem here.
1306983107480829956 2020-09-18 23:47:10 +0800 <Camelback71> @yvonnewingett @FlyGalAZ @dougducey Let's hope its not another grifting, quick buck scam like many of these PACs are.  The first order of business for this PAC is getting the legislature back in session.  If not, the organization is a fraud.
1306982554851921920 2020-09-18 23:44:58 +0800 <Camelback71> This is asanine.   How many pieces of mail postmarked on November 2 will take till November 16 to suddenly arrive in a county recorder's office?
1306981493248372736 2020-09-18 23:40:45 +0800 <Camelback71> @PolitiHate To answer his question:  Yes, they will be needed but most of the military brass will balk at executing Trump's orders causing a major constitutional crisis that may require junior officers, loyal to the Constitution, to turn on their their superiors.
1306967125576224769 2020-09-18 22:43:39 +0800 <Camelback71> When Trump wins reelection, the first guy sent packing needs to be this useless turd.

1306957254533414912 2020-09-18 22:04:26 +0800 <Camelback71> Another surrender monkey conservative. üëáüëáüëá

1306817879472443393 2020-09-18 12:50:36 +0800 <Camelback71> I'm at a loss why the conservative movement is such an abject failure.
1306785024667201541 2020-09-18 10:40:03 +0800 <Camelback71> This asshole.
1306784399527116801 2020-09-18 10:37:34 +0800 <Camelback71> 2020 has now brought us one of the two major candidates for President accusing and convicting the other of deliberate mass murder.

1306738585224134656 2020-09-18 07:35:31 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos All of these libertarian talking points about constitutional limits and powers are only applicable in pre-1965 America. That's why no conservative should pay them any mind and no GOP legislator or executive should.

1306621168300875776 2020-09-17 23:48:57 +0800 <Camelback71> @SoothingDave I actually can't.  I wasn't born till the early 1970s.
1306600292260093952 2020-09-17 22:25:59 +0800 <Camelback71> @zones2surf @PolitiBunny The entire story is fishy. I don't doubt Trump hit on her but anything more than that? Her excuses for not continuing to be around him don't add up.
1306584494787325954 2020-09-17 21:23:13 +0800 <Camelback71> Syria isn't America. We should not be sacrificing American lives as a proxy for Israel.

1306488783500525568 2020-09-17 15:02:54 +0800 <Camelback71> Once again Bill Barr does alot of talking but his department does nothing concrete to stop these "intrusions of civil liberties".
1306488420605206528 2020-09-17 15:01:27 +0800 <Camelback71> Nothing. Barr just gives speeches. Own the libs and all that crap.

1306400920641572864 2020-09-17 09:13:45 +0800 <Camelback71> Under the 1924 Immigration Act, their parents would have been shoved back in steerage.
1306400581632753670 2020-09-17 09:12:25 +0800 <Camelback71> It might have something to do with nursing homes.
1306400291135172609 2020-09-17 09:11:15 +0800 <Camelback71> @TOOEdit So the question asks itself: How did you end up Catholic with that many Scots in your ancestry?
1306399868030656512 2020-09-17 09:09:34 +0800 <Camelback71> @tonib Lmao!!
1306399634999267328 2020-09-17 09:08:39 +0800 <Camelback71> We have a retired Pope who's a modern day, diet coke version of Joseph de Maistre. The actual Pope is a graduate of a 1960s Marxist commune.

1306290381412159488 2020-09-17 01:54:31 +0800 <Camelback71> You've been acting like King George III since April and continue to act like him.  I'd say you and your lackeys on the 9th Floor are the ones who need a good civics lesson.

1306248600133890050 2020-09-16 23:08:29 +0800 <Camelback71> This isn't Mexico, Doug.
1306226060988571649 2020-09-16 21:38:56 +0800 <Camelback71> There's no guarantee of a vaccine. As such, herd immunity is the best and only strategy if we want society to get back to normal.
1306225744763215873 2020-09-16 21:37:40 +0800 <Camelback71> He's certainly not using the data.
1306225119065288704 2020-09-16 21:35:11 +0800 <Camelback71> Nonsense. The data from every country, including the US, suggests herd immunity for this particular vurus, is reached at 20-25% population infection.
1306224074662658048 2020-09-16 21:31:02 +0800 <Camelback71> If the team had voted to honor one of the Manson girls, Madden here thinks every teammate had an obligation to go along.
1306223032495681537 2020-09-16 21:26:54 +0800 <Camelback71> Looks like a peaceful protest to most of America.

1306117564766892032 2020-09-16 14:27:48 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, he should have honored a guy who was an accessory to a drive-by shooting.
1306073895854727174 2020-09-16 11:34:17 +0800 <Camelback71> He just needed to do what every other Steeler did and honor an accessory to a drive-by shooting. A felon. Got it.
1306073247809642496 2020-09-16 11:31:42 +0800 <Camelback71> Facebook doesn't care about conservatives' trust just like the NFL doesn't care what half its fanbase thinks.
1306072773492498432 2020-09-16 11:29:49 +0800 <Camelback71> Don't worry. The free market will take care of it!
1306072491488493568 2020-09-16 11:28:42 +0800 <Camelback71> Mark Zuckerberg doesn't care what his credibility is worth to you people and the right in general. He cares about pushing a political agenda which can only be stopped by forceful government intervention, not your precious "free markets".

1305944566168604674 2020-09-16 03:00:22 +0800 <Camelback71> She's still pushing the "masks work" nonsense.
1305939683248017409 2020-09-16 02:40:58 +0800 <Camelback71> This is why the state is turning blue.  Legal immigration needs to be curtailed. Drastically.
1305939380247257088 2020-09-16 02:39:46 +0800 <Camelback71> Progress.
1305939243429060608 2020-09-16 02:39:13 +0800 <Camelback71> Are you reporting on the peace deal or acting as some kind of snitch for the China virus gestapo?
1305909886841094149 2020-09-16 00:42:34 +0800 <Camelback71> He was narcissist because his team decided to honor a guy who was an accessory to a drive-by shooting. Ah, okay.
1305908853817528320 2020-09-16 00:38:28 +0800 <Camelback71> @KellyTownsend11 @dougducey You have an army of Arizona citizens who are ready to protest at the Capitol with you.  Call a press conference and put Ducey and your colleagues on the spot.  Simply tweeting isn't going to get the job done.
1305908430427705345 2020-09-16 00:36:47 +0800 <Camelback71> @SoothingDave Those taking Villanueva to task over this have no response when it's pointed out to them who Antwon Rose was and what he did.  These clownish woke fans of the Steelers just took it on faith the guy was a saint who was unjustly shot by a white police officer.
1305901842551898112 2020-09-16 00:10:36 +0800 <Camelback71> The term "Keystone State" is actually derived from the fact that Pennsylvania was the key to Jeffersonian dominance of the Presidency during the first 20 years of the 19th century.
1305897588915187713 2020-09-15 23:53:42 +0800 <Camelback71> Sweetheart, you support BLM. Who are you kidding?
1305897377434234880 2020-09-15 23:52:51 +0800 <Camelback71> How has the White community enriched the culture of Arizona, Doug?
1305896779812986880 2020-09-15 23:50:29 +0800 <Camelback71> @MattGajtka @colin_dunlap About as simple as you supporting the Steelers decision to put the name of an accessory to a drive-by shooting on the back of their helmet.
1305880261528150017 2020-09-15 22:44:51 +0800 <Camelback71> @SmoothAsButter Sweetheart, if the team actually cared about racism and didn't want someone leaving the reservation it wouldn't be putting Rose's name on the back of their helmets.
1305877449767448578 2020-09-15 22:33:40 +0800 <Camelback71> @SmoothAsButter That's not the same situation or circumstances but please go on.
1305876558360444929 2020-09-15 22:30:08 +0800 <Camelback71> You're honestly an idiot. Ben probably didn't know about Rose's involvement in a drive-by shooting.
1305876245637287937 2020-09-15 22:28:53 +0800 <Camelback71> Ya, that's why he passed on having the name of an accessory to a drive-by shooting on the back of his helmet.
1305742732736913408 2020-09-15 13:38:21 +0800 <Camelback71> That's a lot of nothing.
1305742417794981888 2020-09-15 13:37:06 +0800 <Camelback71> So what? Are they dead? On ventilators? In the hospital?
1305729309898805252 2020-09-15 12:45:01 +0800 <Camelback71> Late 1960s violent cinema isn't remotely comparable to pedophilia porn dressed up as a coming of age movie.

1305671594191122432 2020-09-15 08:55:40 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao. A line-up of gatekeepers and bootlickers.
1305671082398023680 2020-09-15 08:53:38 +0800 <Camelback71> Maybe, just maybe, he doesn't want to support an accessory to a drive-by shooting?
1305652834046676992 2020-09-15 07:41:08 +0800 <Camelback71> In other words, he publicly admitted he was a fifth columnist and violating his constitutional oath.
1305632425481916417 2020-09-15 06:20:02 +0800 <Camelback71> Local fake news reporter is upset.
1305632096824614912 2020-09-15 06:18:44 +0800 <Camelback71> He needs to hold a rally with thousands of Arizonans, no masks and no social distancing.
1305631524872544256 2020-09-15 06:16:27 +0800 <Camelback71> @Steve_Sailer @Inductivist Not surprisingly, John Milius had something to do with that.
1305629570935087105 2020-09-15 06:08:41 +0800 <Camelback71> You're such a fraud.  Trump needs to hold a real rally here like he did in Nevada last night.  No masks, no social distancing just to stick it up your nose.
1305629250347651072 2020-09-15 06:07:25 +0800 <Camelback71> YAF is nothing more than a corporate-sponsored electric fence for the failed conservative movement.

1305574258534354944 2020-09-15 02:28:54 +0800 <Camelback71> If we can enforce business closures, mask mandates and contact trace the virus, we can ship 300,000 Salvadorans back to Central America.
1305573343706243072 2020-09-15 02:25:16 +0800 <Camelback71> Tell that to the bar owners who opens up and has his liquor license pulled, you moron.

1305186666785591297 2020-09-14 00:48:45 +0800 <Camelback71> French thinks he's Pope of the evangelicals.
1305185995579555841 2020-09-14 00:46:05 +0800 <Camelback71> You can tell this went through 20-30 drafts.
1305153936379191297 2020-09-13 22:38:41 +0800 <Camelback71> But here's the thing, since the 1990s, the right in America has consistently drifted left so that you're typically Democrat who helped to speed up cultural Marxist change 20 years ago is now just voting Republican because they find "Cuties" is going a little too far.
1305151786139807749 2020-09-13 22:30:09 +0800 <Camelback71> @RyanGirdusky @FoxworthFor14 That's still not enough with whites. I'm still skeptical about Trump hitting near 10% of blacks.
1305149970866077696 2020-09-13 22:22:56 +0800 <Camelback71> Here's some of Gavin Newsom's climate changers.  https://t.co/ZBqKqxq9QQ

1304937548192428032 2020-09-13 08:18:50 +0800 <Camelback71> @HELPME_IM_OLD More boomer nonsense from Scott Adams.
1304892897272107008 2020-09-13 05:21:25 +0800 <Camelback71> Because too many in Washington, LA, and NYC were more concerned about gay marriage.
1304810204756811776 2020-09-12 23:52:49 +0800 <Camelback71> Lmao.
1304775912043372544 2020-09-12 21:36:33 +0800 <Camelback71> Why? Nearly 30% of New York City's population was infected. Madrid's infection percentage was less than half that. NYC surpassed the burnout herd immunity level of 20-25%, Madrid has not.
1304773861573931009 2020-09-12 21:28:24 +0800 <Camelback71> I'm so glad the pedophilia apologists are going public.

1304771636315348996 2020-09-12 21:19:34 +0800 <Camelback71> Bringing back whitey ain't so bad especially if it means my family won't starve.

1304581932735315969 2020-09-12 08:45:45 +0800 <Camelback71> Apparently NBA coaches can't have free speech if it means donating money to candidates opposed to the toxic agenda of BLM.
1304580556814909440 2020-09-12 08:40:17 +0800 <Camelback71> This pretty much tells one that Durham's investigation will be a whitewash with no major indictments and marked by a pathethic "report" full of verbal wristslaps.

1304500803093188608 2020-09-12 03:23:22 +0800 <Camelback71> God forbid we have one private school out there that actually teaches the classics and tailors its curriculum to help students actually succeed in the real world instead of creating a new crop of recruits for Antifa.

1304262766115594245 2020-09-11 11:37:30 +0800 <Camelback71> Women's empowerment in 2020 now includes praising a pedophile movie with 11 year old girls twerking and getting naked.
1304262002647412737 2020-09-11 11:34:28 +0800 <Camelback71> From your Twitter feed tonight you don't seem tired of the woke politics. You watched the game.
1304243620044709888 2020-09-11 10:21:25 +0800 <Camelback71> It would have been better not to do some phony arm-in-arm "stand of unity" to BLM.
1304242534315520001 2020-09-11 10:17:06 +0800 <Camelback71> You're watching that crap?
1304241960950013953 2020-09-11 10:14:49 +0800 <Camelback71> Translation: Americans booing the anti-Americans and mocking their racialist nonsense.

1304207294964535297 2020-09-11 07:57:04 +0800 <Camelback71> Trading Gavin Newsome for Mike DeWine isn't much of an upgrade.
1304191414167695361 2020-09-11 06:53:58 +0800 <Camelback71> No, they won't.  The fact is if a bookie wasn't available with a simple click their ratings would drop precipitously.
1304190617853898752 2020-09-11 06:50:48 +0800 <Camelback71> @NBurdens Has Guy Benson said one word about "Cuties"??

1304182734860947456 2020-09-11 06:19:29 +0800 <Camelback71> Guy who bought into the UW study that predicted 2 million US deaths from the China Virus cites moving goalposts.
1304181899305181185 2020-09-11 06:16:09 +0800 <Camelback71> Another guy who is under the mistaken impression that the politics is going to be confined to a 45 minute political intro.
1304181311024717824 2020-09-11 06:13:49 +0800 <Camelback71> He literally thinks these numbers bolster his porn panic Karenism.

1303884117122007040 2020-09-10 10:32:53 +0800 <Camelback71> @SoothingDave I agree. I have the luxury of living in Arizona during football season. Plenty of things to do besides camping in front of a TV.
1303883861223288833 2020-09-10 10:31:52 +0800 <Camelback71> @NBurdens So true. He got what he wanted out of being Ace's gay friend. Now he's just an insufferable gay lefty lawyer living in DC. I had met too many of his types during my time there to be fooled by his "conservative" posture bullshit.
1303883046542745600 2020-09-10 10:28:37 +0800 <Camelback71> @SoothingDave Hell, he's a sports columnist, reporter whatever. He gets paid to watch the crap and offer opinions. He can certainly let the world know that he thinks most of the boycotters are full of shit. He can't though misrepresent the extent of the activism being confined to the anthem.
1303880941018914817 2020-09-10 10:20:15 +0800 <Camelback71> It affects your country you moron. But hey from your replies here, you'd sell your mother to watch sports.

1303811369091776513 2020-09-10 05:43:48 +0800 <Camelback71> The entire reason for passing the 1964 Civil Rights Act and subsequent re-authorizations was to put to an end such toxic racialist nonsense.  Instead, the opposite happened.

1303778211717758976 2020-09-10 03:32:03 +0800 <Camelback71> For those who think they can stomach watching the NFL by avoiding two minutes of kneeling before every game.  Think again.
1303776081648865281 2020-09-10 03:23:35 +0800 <Camelback71> You need to recalibrate your facts. The virus hasn't "killed 190,000 Americans."  That number is off by at least a factor of 3.

1303766995821715458 2020-09-10 02:47:29 +0800 <Camelback71> The nation was never going to "restrict the spread".  The virus was always going to virus.

1303765046598619136 2020-09-10 02:39:44 +0800 <Camelback71> That's not what we're talking about here. He shut down the damn economy for a month not less than 15 days after this interview.   A shutdown that, in retrospect, was unnecessary and destructive.
1303735492278587392 2020-09-10 00:42:18 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos @tonib Many of these comments came even before the US outbreak of the virus. With 6 months worth of data, we can simply say Trump was right not to induce a panic. It wasn't a plague although too many governors have treated it as such. His views on the virus and children was wildly off.
1303732348173733888 2020-09-10 00:29:48 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos The generals care more about keeping corporations happy and fat ("alliances") than improving the lot of the American working class. This is controversial?

1303718141722161153 2020-09-09 23:33:21 +0800 <Camelback71> @TianaTheFirst The folks looting are mostly black, not white - but whatever.
1303717684345892867 2020-09-09 23:31:32 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin It's all about saying "he went to Michigan", "he visited the State".  The optics don't matter.  From the looks of it he's trying to avoid the mistakes of Hillary and actually amplify the campaign's "concern" about the voters in these states.
1303687979681157121 2020-09-09 21:33:30 +0800 <Camelback71> If you've even caught 10 minutes of an NBA telecast you'd know it will be much more than just a minute or two of kneeling.

1303458102432288775 2020-09-09 06:20:03 +0800 <Camelback71> @VDAREJamesK As Pittsburgh goes, PA goes.  Pittsburgh's suburbs, not Philadelphia's, are the key for a Republican winning the state.  The war on police, BLM and the riots tips these suburbs to Trump and they most likely tip Philly's exurbs.  But, like you, I think Trump is still down here.
1303450500554280960 2020-09-09 05:49:50 +0800 <Camelback71> @MelLynnAz If Arizona can send Sinema to the Senate it most certainly can go blue.   Importing thousands more south of the border immigrants to the State over the last 40 years doesn't help either.
1303440135711752195 2020-09-09 05:08:39 +0800 <Camelback71> @MelLynnAz I think Arizona does go blue.  I hate to say it but Trump may be hurt by the performance of the state's Republican Party.  McSally is an awful Senate candidate, Ducey has pissed off every Republican except for his lackeys in the legislature and the demographics are worse than '16
1303429196631416837 2020-09-09 04:25:11 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin Unfortunately that's 50% of the country.  Masks would have been torn off in most places of the country if this isn't the case.
1303428496530628608 2020-09-09 04:22:24 +0800 <Camelback71> Compare this to the clownish Republicans who run Texas and Arizona.
1303427504305319940 2020-09-09 04:18:28 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin Virus panic porn really has jumped the shark.  Of course, many a TV show has jumped the shark too but the networks still squeezed out a few more seasons.  Expect more of this crap because the media knows most regular Joes and Jills won't look past the fine print of a headline.
1303416402628366336 2020-09-09 03:34:21 +0800 <Camelback71> You won't see Biden signs in Central and South Phoenix, Glendale, Tempe, Mesa and most parts of Tucson.  But 80% of the people living in these areas won't be voting for Trump.
1303414892964261889 2020-09-09 03:28:21 +0800 <Camelback71> No, we don't. There hospitals are not overwhelmed and nobody is dying like the plague.
1303413344649453568 2020-09-09 03:22:12 +0800 <Camelback71> Exactly. You can't play the United Colors of Benetton game at the RNC and play down your accomplishments on restricting immigration and not expect working class whites in the Northwest to have second thoughts on their vote.
1303387989058363393 2020-09-09 01:41:27 +0800 <Camelback71> He touts these numbers but continues his draconian fiats.  People are still wearing masks - even in health clubs.  Bars are still all but shut down.  And schools remain closed.
1303382675269414913 2020-09-09 01:20:20 +0800 <Camelback71> @MelLynnAz @GarretLewis @dougducey I don't believe he is running again.  He can't possibly be doing this to brandish his credentials on a run for the Presidency.  Arizona Republicans will torch him in the media and he won't even win the primary here.  It's got to be a cabinet post should Trump win.
1303382103485108224 2020-09-09 01:18:03 +0800 <Camelback71> The truth is the virus outbreak in New York has been traced to a neighborhood in Queens with a large Chinese ethnic population.  But... Orange Man Bad.

Like other think tanks that popped up in Washington during the late 1970s, the economics of such places guaranteed it becoming a megaphone for whatever its corporate high income libertarian donors asked for and calling it conservatism.

Gyms are unhealthy. We can highlight these numbers till we're blue in the face.  The fact is we have nobody representing our interests on Washington Street.

1301631682928287746 2020-09-04 05:22:31 +0800 <Camelback71> @NillWylander There is no scientific reviewed peer reviewed study of Covid. Lmao.

1301623189777215488 2020-09-04 04:48:46 +0800 <Camelback71> @NillWylander This coronavirus can have a higher R0 moron so long as the herd threshold is 20-25% infection.  And, as the data will tell you, its lethality is concentrated on the older folks and people with certain co-morbidities.  You're making the virus out to be the plague here. It's not.
1301622287431426048 2020-09-04 04:45:10 +0800 <Camelback71> @NillWylander It will work.  It works with the flu.  Nobody is saying the virus is going away.  The population will have to work up herd every year in the absence of a vaccine.
1301621752561192960 2020-09-04 04:43:03 +0800 <Camelback71> @NillWylander But I am.  The R0 for most southwestern states is nearing, at or below zero now.

1301617631141613568 2020-09-04 04:26:40 +0800 <Camelback71> @NillWylander I'm getting your point moron.  And your original point was Sweden's herd immunity strategy didn't work.  It did.  Once the virus hit 20-25% population infection, herd kicked in because the virus already induced strong memory responses among the majority of the population.
1301616403926056960 2020-09-04 04:21:48 +0800 <Camelback71> @NillWylander Wrong.  Herd immunity works if the virus can be fought by both antibodies and T-cells. Mutations upset this dynamic for sure but your silly idea of hiding from the virus is asanine, Mr. Dunning Kruger.

You could argue they didn't reverse course on that policy sooner but if you're looking for excess deaths that's the only place you'll find it.
1301582493137604608 2020-09-04 02:07:03 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos 1640s Cromwell, good. 1650s Cromwell, bad.
1301581829883883520 2020-09-04 02:04:25 +0800 <Camelback71> @NillWylander @burrrgers @MSNBC Nonsense.
1301581251766153216 2020-09-04 02:02:07 +0800 <Camelback71> Sweden did not send out any such advisory.  And they pursued the correct strategy.  They got herd immunity faster than anybody and their case and death numbers have flatlined.
1301580964334727168 2020-09-04 02:00:58 +0800 <Camelback71> ...and in doing so, destroy as much of the American economy as possible.
1301580437752430592 2020-09-04 01:58:53 +0800 <Camelback71> Tucker Carlson had the best take on this subject.  Carney is just rehashing the "Kyle should not have been there in the first place" crap.   Well, with the police standing down doing nothing, WHO should be there, Brit?
1301544965403635712 2020-09-03 23:37:55 +0800 <Camelback71> It tells you alot about the current state of our government that it took 30 years to expose this fraud.
1301543859759886338 2020-09-03 23:33:32 +0800 <Camelback71> You had to learn to behave morally.  It isn't an inate way of behaving. Now where do you suppose your moral way of living comes from?  Some atheist preacher in the 12th century?
1301510895168712705 2020-09-03 21:22:32 +0800 <Camelback71> Ted let's you know why Democrats need dead people voting in November.
1301507789450215425 2020-09-03 21:10:12 +0800 <Camelback71> They're removing the statue of the city's namesake. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1301501333137100802 2020-09-03 20:44:33 +0800 <Camelback71> All these numbers and this idiot still has the state wearing masks, including gym-goers.
1301498585138118667 2020-09-03 20:33:38 +0800 <Camelback71> Get back to a pre-1965 approach to immigration.
1301419952759480321 2020-09-03 15:21:10 +0800 <Camelback71> I see white people.
1301351452229513216 2020-09-03 10:48:58 +0800 <Camelback71> Open up to 100%, no more masks. We know you're not wearing one.
1301351028588068866 2020-09-03 10:47:17 +0800 <Camelback71> Solution: More tax cuts! Buy Guns and Ammo!
1301350725469892608 2020-09-03 10:46:05 +0800 <Camelback71> Your mommy made the appointment and kept the appointment knowing the business was shutdown. That's not a setup, sweetie.
1301308866739630080 2020-09-03 07:59:45 +0800 <Camelback71> I believe Rex was too busy with other problems during Obama's Presidency.
1301295003604402177 2020-09-03 07:04:40 +0800 <Camelback71> Sturgis turned out to be the Killing Fields. Or not.
1301294226978697216 2020-09-03 07:01:35 +0800 <Camelback71> There's a reason it happened in Irving.  The grammar looks like Mola Ram wrote it.
1301277559733190656 2020-09-03 05:55:21 +0800 <Camelback71> Darren must have missed the CDC report on ACTUAL Covid deaths.
1301268682258046976 2020-09-03 05:20:04 +0800 <Camelback71> There are better places to open a bar or a nightclub.
1301268093079969793 2020-09-03 05:17:44 +0800 <Camelback71> You didn't expect Maleficent to fess up and fall on her sword did you?
1301267756977778688 2020-09-03 05:16:24 +0800 <Camelback71> @SoothingDave @oneunderscore__ @secupp I do enjoy all these left-wing nutjobs getting their panties in a wad over a conspiracy theory, at best, 10% of the U.S. population even knew existed two weeks ago.
1301267107015876608 2020-09-03 05:13:49 +0800 <Camelback71> Undeniable Truth of Life Number 141.
1301243301555662848 2020-09-03 03:39:13 +0800 <Camelback71> I've said it many times, Joe Biden is a scumbag. A gutter dwelling scumbag.
1301241922741104640 2020-09-03 03:33:44 +0800 <Camelback71> @masksaregay Maybe so.  Isn't the Masters the week after the election?
1301207143270416385 2020-09-03 01:15:32 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos Quite frankly, a major troll would have been doing the stars and bars flag with the magnolia in the canton.  But this is much better than I feared. I like the 20 white stars (Mississippi is the 20th state) with the gold union star (I'm guessing).
1301205695442817024 2020-09-03 01:09:47 +0800 <Camelback71> "Super season" with no fans in attendance? Ah, okay.
1301196799483416578 2020-09-03 00:34:26 +0800 <Camelback71> Who in the Trump campaign agrees to these people? They're all cosmopolitan leftists.  In the case of Susan Page, a loon.  Every damn one of them.
1301187604163903488 2020-09-02 23:57:54 +0800 <Camelback71> Thou shall not criticize or even bring up the name Bill Kristol because he's a Jew.  Novel concept.
1301187073479643140 2020-09-02 23:55:47 +0800 <Camelback71> @masksaregay We freed the slaves only to have their ancestors wage war on us?
1301168016160219139 2020-09-02 22:40:04 +0800 <Camelback71> @VDAREJamesK In 20 years, you'll see a bunch of drunk Chinese gingers reaking havoc in Dublin.
1301157868951879681 2020-09-02 21:59:44 +0800 <Camelback71> @cruadin @TheBabylonBee The guy has four houses?? On a mayor's salary? Does he have Nike stock options?
1301157480261509120 2020-09-02 21:58:12 +0800 <Camelback71> @PolitiHate I see white people.
1301156171932291072 2020-09-02 21:53:00 +0800 <Camelback71> I think they hit that long ago.
1301155993292697600 2020-09-02 21:52:17 +0800 <Camelback71> In a more serious country this "judge" would be bagging groceries.
1301155509551001602 2020-09-02 21:50:22 +0800 <Camelback71> You'd think murders, rapes and burglaries would be a little higher on the list down under.
1301006371127582723 2020-09-02 11:57:45 +0800 <Camelback71> Bullshit. Bullshit. There is no vaccine. C'mon??
1301005317300346881 2020-09-02 11:53:33 +0800 <Camelback71> @masksaregay It takes a pompous ass like Baseball Cuck to barf up that bile. The guy thinks he's the Bill James of austere Beltway punditry. In reality he's just another Con Inc. mediocrity who dreams of writing for The Atlantic.
1300925343201546240 2020-09-02 06:35:46 +0800 <Camelback71> Even this moron is on the vaccine train.
1300920520523751424 2020-09-02 06:16:36 +0800 <Camelback71> There aren't any serious "policing issues" in need of solving.
1300904787232260097 2020-09-02 05:14:05 +0800 <Camelback71> @camcurt13 @dougducey @KellyTownsend11 It could start with the GOP caucuses in both houses calling a press conference or rally at the Capitol denouncing Ducey.  These state lawmakers need to take an actual stand, not just tweet or show up on a radio talk show.
1300892327150366720 2020-09-02 04:24:34 +0800 <Camelback71> @tonib I'm waiting for @NRO's "The Conservative Case for Dredging the Tidal Basin and Moving the Jefferson Memorial"....
1300891555046121472 2020-09-02 04:21:30 +0800 <Camelback71> @tonib You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.
1300851119313174528 2020-09-02 01:40:50 +0800 <Camelback71> There is no such thing as "smart, proactive steps to reduce" the virus. The virus is going to virus. All these "proactive steps" do is crush businesses.
1300835729421922306 2020-09-02 00:39:40 +0800 <Camelback71> This is isn't equality of opportunity. It's equality of outcome.
1300832799071465472 2020-09-02 00:28:02 +0800 <Camelback71> @PaulZeise Arizona isn't a swing state? Colorado isn't a swing state? ü§™
1300831023677100032 2020-09-02 00:20:58 +0800 <Camelback71> @SoothingDave @four4thefire "NBC News Analysis".  Translation:  Bullshit.
1300830402207125504 2020-09-02 00:18:30 +0800 <Camelback71> This is nonsense.
1300828415403028482 2020-09-02 00:10:37 +0800 <Camelback71> No burning buildings. No skateboard wielding felons.  No smashed out business windows. Citizens exercising their Constitutional rights.  Ah, what's the issue here?
1300827443737980929 2020-09-02 00:06:45 +0800 <Camelback71> The Chamber of Commerce is among the most subversive, anti-American organizations in the country.
1300791683429199872 2020-09-01 21:44:39 +0800 <Camelback71> @SoothingDave @Gitabushi All geographic orientation is based on the Original 13.
1300781925963935744 2020-09-01 21:05:53 +0800 <Camelback71> @KellyTownsend11 @dougducey Maybe on Twitter but most of the people in Arizona aren't on this platform. They need you to get in front of microphone, with your colleagues, and call out the Governor. If not, it's still all talk.
1300776085299232769 2020-09-01 20:42:40 +0800 <Camelback71> And? He did.
1300775224871251969 2020-09-01 20:39:15 +0800 <Camelback71> Apparently, the Miami Herald does believe in the blood libel of the 1619 project.
1300774438678327298 2020-09-01 20:36:08 +0800 <Camelback71> Really makes you want to look at the Stars and Stripes and feel proud of this country, doesn't it?
1300773850859237378 2020-09-01 20:33:47 +0800 <Camelback71> The first man of the House, James Madison, must be rolling over in his grave with the thought of this third world trash sitting in the cornerstone of his Republic.
1300662926857043969 2020-09-01 13:13:01 +0800 <Camelback71> I live how the myriad of videos that are all over social media offer no "evidence" of Trump's take on Rittenhouse. They simply don't exist.
1300660423977365505 2020-09-01 13:03:04 +0800 <Camelback71> And then we have this world class, vacillating idiot...
1300613566999920641 2020-09-01 09:56:53 +0800 <Camelback71> @NBurdens @KamalaHarris Did I miss where Trump cooked up the virus in an RV in the New Mexico desert and let it loose in the country?
1300602180248858624 2020-09-01 09:11:38 +0800 <Camelback71> This tweet brought to you by David Frum.
1300601662881497089 2020-09-01 09:09:35 +0800 <Camelback71> @BigJebBos Trust (really can't) but, well, we never seem to get to the verify part.
