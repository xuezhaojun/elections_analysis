1342019244637237248 2020-12-24 16:08:16 +0800 <BgirlAmanda> Question is, will we still have a country?
1342018341913976834 2020-12-24 16:04:40 +0800 <BgirlAmanda> Figured out my life philosophy:  Love whoever the hell you want AS LONG AS YOU ARE LOVING   As long as you are HATING, I don't need your energy near me.  What we all NEED right now is LOVE
1342000393870602240 2020-12-24 14:53:21 +0800 <BgirlAmanda> It's raining. That's fitting for this day. 3 years ago, the world lost a great man and never knew it. I knew it. I function despite this horrendous loss. And the world kept turning. Keeps turning. It hurts. And it's hard. No matter what I do.   I miss you, Dad
1341644723941863425 2020-12-23 15:20:03 +0800 <BgirlAmanda> On this day 3 years ago, I lost my Dad. Not a single day goes by that I don't think of him. I love you, Dad. I miss you so much.   Merry Christmas,  Your Babygirl

1329971825783304193 2020-11-21 10:16:07 +0800 <BgirlAmanda> I bought the 2020 Presidential chessboard (off tv) that has Joe and Kamala (and other Dems) vs trump, Pence and Senate and House Repubs and I just realized that trump and Joe are the kings so that makes Kamala and PENCE QUEENS!! PENCE IS A QUEEN!! 🤣😂 I LOVE it!!

1325238401017245697 2020-11-08 08:47:11 +0800 <BgirlAmanda> I will forever remember 2020 as the year of covid19 but, that ultimately ended on a positive note when America stood up for our morals and our values in one voice by electing @JoeBiden !!

1311176447357313024 2020-09-30 13:30:00 +0800 <BgirlAmanda> What do you do if your opponent doesn't follow the rules? You follow your morals and keep trying to hold them accountable for not still following the rules like you are #PresidentialDebate
1311174370631602176 2020-09-30 13:21:45 +0800 <BgirlAmanda> I honestly feel sorry for the factcheckers at CNN after the #PresidentialDebate

1311128989138849795 2020-09-30 10:21:25 +0800 <BgirlAmanda> Giving trump more time than Biden makes him seem so, imo. Also, these questions seem partisan, as well, making him suspect
1311127969591627781 2020-09-30 10:17:22 +0800 <BgirlAmanda> Notice that when @JoeBiden talks, he speaks TO the American people directly into the camera and how trump can't bring himself to look us in the eye? His glances go at Joe, left. right and down and NEVER does he address US, THE PEOPLE or even look our way! #PresidentialDebate2020

After I make this trump pumpkin, I'm going to leave it outside a few days to ensure my trumper neighbors see it. Then, I'm going to violently smash it in full view. Pics 2 come

1307538798125944832 2020-09-20 12:35:17 +0800 <BgirlAmanda> Every time I see a trump flag, all I hear is "I love the uneducated poor"... Is that wrong?

1306243195643342850 2020-09-16 22:47:01 +0800 <BgirlAmanda> If you follow this account, I recommend vetting asap. NOT a resistor!!
1306242137625956354 2020-09-16 22:42:49 +0800 <BgirlAmanda> Yeah, cuz how DARE abc force the president to answer to people who haven't drank the Koolaid, even though he is supposed to serve them. Some nerve of them expecting him to address their concerns and fears, huh?
1306089484820324357 2020-09-16 12:36:13 +0800 <BgirlAmanda> Government has always been a little too comfortable in it's niche. It and everyone in the USA needs to remember that change is progress. Learning means growing and therefore changing
1305361388701970432 2020-09-14 12:23:02 +0800 <BgirlAmanda> Nope. Narcicissts don't care by definition #TrumpKnew

1304520987153780742 2020-09-12 04:43:34 +0800 <BgirlAmanda> Got in an argument with a neighbor and quickly realized I had to be arguing with a Republican. Instead of making any counterpoints, he would attack me personally and cuss at me. This is why we can't have intelligent conversations with them. Sad, really.
1304434948712148992 2020-09-11 23:01:41 +0800 <BgirlAmanda> Less than 3,000 people died on 9/11 and POTUS visits the memorial. 191,803 people have died this year from covid19 SO FAR, thanks in GREAT PART to his lack of response and he STILL refuses to even acknowledge the virus or their sacrifice. Where's their memorial?
1303765615321264131 2020-09-10 02:42:00 +0800 <BgirlAmanda> The trump/Republican way:  Let's not talk about the problem at hand. Instead, I'm gonna accuse of some crazy shit that doesn't even have to make sense or have any facts behind it and has absolutely nothing to do with why you were arguing with me
1303748739409088516 2020-09-10 01:34:56 +0800 <BgirlAmanda> @JerryZ1961 I use  https://t.co/2dhpguZHYe It's free for so many daily and it sorts them so u can see what's going on. Hope it helps 😊
