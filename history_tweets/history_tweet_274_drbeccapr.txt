1312032596667363330 2020-10-02 22:12:02 +0800 <drbeccapr> Excited to be invited to shape Canada's future digital research infrastructure that our researchers need today!  https://t.co/Sfrb2VMsWd
1311305841795100680 2020-09-30 22:04:10 +0800 <drbeccapr> Retweeting this on #OrangeShirtDay2020 .
1311304704866037760 2020-09-30 21:59:39 +0800 <drbeccapr> Estimates suggest somewhere between 3000 and 6000 indigenous children died in residential schools. Their lives mattered. #everychild matters  https://t.co/h1eBrgpTlG
1311093920227618817 2020-09-30 08:02:04 +0800 <drbeccapr> #CPStweetchat @KidsInPain   Patients &amp; professionals- just a shout out to check out parent/patient oriented info sheets housed at @SickKidsNews Pain hub .  We separated out sheets for acute and chronic pain and for 4 different age groups (babes to teens!)  https://t.co/U0BD8dSVnz  https://t.co/xCuM3qv2qg
1311092927171620865 2020-09-30 07:58:07 +0800 <drbeccapr> @CanadianPain Q7. Wording on the accompanying note seems similar to old not emphasizing the inability to communicate (which is SO critical to infants and others who cannot speak).  What got my attention is the great addition of nonhuman animals experiencing pain.  WahoOOO! #CPStweetchat
1311091615415574533 2020-09-30 07:52:54 +0800 <drbeccapr> @vader_kyle Q6. @vader_kyle curious why they did not specify 'chronic pain'.  When would acute pain not be adaptive in some small way? #CPStweetchat
1311090354846924800 2020-09-30 07:47:54 +0800 <drbeccapr> @JeffreyMogil @Virginia_McI @kren27 @CanadianPain @mcgillu So worrisome that work has shown veterinarians get more pain training than many in human medical school! #CPStweetchat
1311089958556499969 2020-09-30 07:46:19 +0800 <drbeccapr> @CanadianPain Q5 I feel that this should be asserted as foundational to the definition not in an accompanying note #CPStweetchat.  Pain is what the patient says remembering a baby may report pain with their actions not words!  https://t.co/mGaopXowhc
1311088852279402496 2020-09-30 07:41:55 +0800 <drbeccapr> @JeffreyMogil @kren27 @CanadianPain @kren27 @JeffreyMogil .  I think learning would impact the idiosyncratic combination of the biological, psychological and the social in a context , thus the experience of pain itself  #CPStweetchat
1311088392239808513 2020-09-30 07:40:06 +0800 <drbeccapr> @SandraWoodsMtl @CanadianPain totally agree that this line about learning is the most problematic relating to newborns in pain! #CPStweetchat @KidsInPain
1311087849421275137 2020-09-30 07:37:56 +0800 <drbeccapr> @CanadianPain Q4  Jumped the gun on this one with earlier tweet...some could misuse the phrase 'learn the concept of pain' to exclude those who have not learned the concept yet like babies!! #CPStweetchat @KidsInPain
1311087090852130817 2020-09-30 07:34:55 +0800 <drbeccapr> @CanadianPain Q3.  I think an important reminder for all of us studying neural responses to pain that no current proxy tools (Heart rate, Face/body activity) to assess pain are specific &amp; while the brain may hold the key to specificity, pain experience is more than brain- it lives in the mind!
1311085308604280834 2020-09-30 07:27:51 +0800 <drbeccapr> @ADanGrenier @CanadianPain as a scientist, trying to operationalize "resembling that associated with" for kids (and adults) who cannot speak will be challenging! #CPStweetchat @KidsInPain
1311084969993867264 2020-09-30 07:26:30 +0800 <drbeccapr> @TO_dpr To me this note is probably the best addition to the @IASPpain pain definition. The unique combination of  how one experiences the biology, psychology &amp; social aspects of pain not only varies from individual to individual but also situation to situation. #CPStweetchat @KidsInPain
1311084175106207747 2020-09-30 07:23:20 +0800 <drbeccapr> @JeffreyMogil @CanadianPain @IASPpain @KidsInPain Hmmm...do think that the "stem" of the definition should never be cited without the 6 notes though.  The stem does not fully address the bias against the nonverbal child (or adult for that matter) #CPStweetchat @KidsInPain
1311083574578360323 2020-09-30 07:20:57 +0800 <drbeccapr> @DrJohnPereira @IASPpain @JeffreyMogil @Virginia_McI @vader_kyle @CanadianPain 'learning the concept of pain' may be tricky as some could use this against infants who have not yet learned (or better put cannot talk about) pain.  Evidence even preterm Infants have neurobiology to experience pain and don't need to LEARN anything! #CPStweetchat @KidsInPain
1311082651227484160 2020-09-30 07:17:17 +0800 <drbeccapr> @CanadianPain Have to admit that as a scientist who has thunk hard on the IASP definition, I think I get what @IASPpain was saying with the new phrase "or resembling that associated with" but not sure so clear other agree with me or understand the addition  #CPStweetchat @KidsInPain
1311081918608351232 2020-09-30 07:14:22 +0800 <drbeccapr> @KidsInPain @CanadianPain Interested to hear from people who know about kids pain...what do you think of the definition as it applies to babies, toddlers, kids and teens? #CPStweetchat @KidsInPain
1311081608791949313 2020-09-30 07:13:08 +0800 <drbeccapr> @TO_dpr @cpn_rdc Hi Dawn!! Great to see you here #CPStweetchat

1311076246214901765 2020-09-30 06:51:50 +0800 <drbeccapr> So pumped to co-host my first tweetchat on a topic dear to the heart of this infant scientist - the new  @IASPpain revised definition of pain.  Have my #CPStweetchat 'search page' loaded and ready.  10 minutes away!!  https://t.co/hI4GlC9nTu

1309148646936584195 2020-09-24 23:12:14 +0800 <drbeccapr> THIS! Psychologists, neurobiologists &amp; clinicians transcending silos. Our study shows skin-to-skin holding may protect baby brains in pain &amp; holding a baby clothed won't have the same protection. Thrilled our study funded by @IASPpain @The_MRC out today in @EFIC_org journal EJOP.
