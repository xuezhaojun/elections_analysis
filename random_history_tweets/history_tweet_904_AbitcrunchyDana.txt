1343949965979226112 2020-12-30 00:00:15 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @drdavidsamadi @timodonnell14 One day in the future‚Ä¶ when this has long been over with‚Ä¶ somebody, somewhere, is gonna ask ‚ÄúHow can that many people be fooled that easily?‚Äù  And they‚Äôre gonna wonder about the smart people‚Ä¶ and they‚Äôll ask ‚ÄúWhat about the doctors and nurses ‚Äì why didn‚Äôt they stop it?‚Äù
1343945266848804864 2020-12-29 23:41:35 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @Rockysback My Aunt moved from Tybee Island to Athens and has to get drivers license changed before she can vote.  Then she has to register with the new address.  Those two entities have limited hours, appointments only, and their websites won't work.  She's not alone.

1343943653224574976 2020-12-29 23:35:10 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> So recently I learned that I cannot follow too many people at one time.  But can I block a lot of people all at once?  I find a democrat and can't help but spend time blocking their dumb friends... saves on the blood pressure rising on an otherwise perfect day.

I don't give a flip about how idiots interpret anything... the FREEDOM to say it --- is a freedom that no other countries have except us --- and you want that taken away???

1343684021256138756 2020-12-29 06:23:29 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @AudreyNashville @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I've been censored for decades.  He's not the only one.  If you don't value Freedom of Speech then go live in China!  YOU are a disgrace and those who fought and died for your freedoms should not be disrespected like this.  I cannot get over how PATHETIC some Americans are!
1343479981633138691 2020-12-28 16:52:42 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> God, please make it stop... give us our lives back.  Destroying small businesses like this is psychological abuse.  This is not America.  Our forefathers would be PISSED!

1343378982633410560 2020-12-28 10:11:22 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @realDonaldTrump Have they kidnapped you?  Replaced you with a clone?  You don't back down... what happened???
1343289411568611330 2020-12-28 04:15:27 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> Twitter won't let me follow anyone and I come back today to find that I've lost a lot of followers... starting to think it's useless.

1343286742561001474 2020-12-28 04:04:51 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @OldIowaGirl @99freemind But there's that word - "required".  Just like the fools who believe their children cannot go to school without useless injections of carcinogens, neurotoxins, and dna from not just animals and insects - but also aborted humans... they believe lies.
1343285917600133123 2020-12-28 04:01:34 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @99freemind In the beginning, I was responding with either "back off" or "No, nor do I put up chainlink fences up to keep out mosquitoes!"  Now I go at it from a patriotic standpoint:  YOU KNOW WE'RE BEING TURNED INTO SLAVES BECAUSE OF YOU FEAR MONGERS... then I follow up with PROVE IT!

1342980966365753345 2020-12-27 07:49:48 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> Anyone following me please be patient.  I'm not being rude, I cannot follow back.  Working on it.

1342730344215289856 2020-12-26 15:13:55 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @SexCounseling Personally, I think everyone should refuse.  On no other grounds other than - I am an American.

1342663940476645378 2020-12-26 10:50:03 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @bonnieUSA1776 @OmarRises Could you work as a Recruiter for min wage jobs?  ü§£
1342662903648952321 2020-12-26 10:45:56 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @SusanStJames3_ That was my first thought too... never heard of a bank someone mentioned - Atlanta Federal Bank?  Small banks are used to funnel laundered money.  And I'm betting more than just our sos and gov are in bed with china money.
1342662031372136448 2020-12-26 10:42:28 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @rayleroad2558 Wow.  I'm convinced all these time-wasting repairs are to intentionally keep Patriots busy.  I'm so sick of it.  Thanks!

I got a comment a week or so ago - didn't make a bit of sense.  Figured out how to do it today and had a major guilt trip over all those I wasn't following (cuz I'm new to twitter).  I know now!  LOL!

1342606438603091969 2020-12-26 07:01:34 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @LynneRenee6 I call them "labeling liberals" because they are so attached to labels.  Just being demons as usual.
1342601816027111424 2020-12-26 06:43:11 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> Legal professionals - is this bs legal?  I keep getting mail 'grading' my neighbors and creating a social 'voting' score.  The one I opened today has my son's name on it - with the current grade of a C+.  We don't want to be 'scored'.  We're not labeling liberals!  https://t.co/aJcGWWn0Wa

1342297627073900545 2020-12-25 10:34:27 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @ChrisKitze @PeoplesPatriot_ I noticed late 90's before "social media" was even a thing - they used Activists to train the bots to respond more 'human'.  They're very effective but every now and then one will say something outlandishly inhuman... that's when you know.
1342293156503691270 2020-12-25 10:16:41 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @CalifMamaBear Surely that bottom is skirted.

Are these rules written somewhere so I can read, review, print, and frame them?  I don't like rules but I'll make an exception, lol!

1341931879184936962 2020-12-24 10:21:06 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> It's as if three different agencies are making it impossible. She has to wait to get an appointment with the DMV.  An absentee ballot won't have time to be processed.
1341931503035559938 2020-12-24 10:19:36 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> My Aunt just moved from Tybee Island, GA to Athens GA.  All she wants to do is vote in January.  The post office said she can't change her address until she closed her P.O. Box (what?).  DMV system won't work on phone or pc.  Can't vote without.
1341850734736891910 2020-12-24 04:58:40 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @mancha_perkins Maybe not when started by people like me and you.  But if there are millions and billions running through the bank account?  Rest assured, it's being laundered.  People start charities with good intent and they're taken over by the cult.
1341849975920144384 2020-12-24 04:55:39 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @amyklobuchar Someone tell her the gigs up.  She didn't get the memo.
1341849073352126472 2020-12-24 04:52:04 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> No time to research but I just heard that the tests work 'better' to give a false-positive if the person being tested is a mask-wearer (because of dead RNA).
1341844056809287686 2020-12-24 04:32:08 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> Doesn't matter where the pork spending is 'going'.  It's coming 'back' to line their pockets.  All charities are set-up as funnels to launder money.

I thought I was doing the right thing getting vetting for an absentee ballot.  Then I put the ballot in the ballot box myself... instead of mailing it.  It wouldn't have mattered either way --- the system is broken and must be replaced!
1341808436321902594 2020-12-24 02:10:35 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @doqholliday That DJT is the greatest president in history and will always be.

He won't be able to run the show from gitmo.  When someone takes over, they may be freedom-loving Americans and we get a whole new twitter!

There, I said it.  Y'all better start saying it too.  I can't even imagine why a bill would provide free wifi.  Humans dropping dead 9 mths ago?

But yeah, google is all about the destruction of truth.  I've watched medical journals become MIA (legally should be open to public) and friends lose their blogs or be shadow-banned, and more.

I spoke to someone who stated that it was out of bitchute's control until they gain enough revenue to do something about it.  So fed up with it!
1340730190981439493 2020-12-21 02:46:01 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @BeverlyHope_CH7 The dems want everyone to be renters.  This is step one - get rid of as many as possible.  The lockdowns are a lot about forced depression and suicide.  The vaccines are designed to depopulate.  The masks are causing chronic illness... and the pills are too of course.
1340729264476450819 2020-12-21 02:42:20 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @mancha_perkins Plus, the Lord cannot come now... there's way too many unsaved souls that need saving.

Anyone who has a pasture can dig down under the posts to bury their guns and ammo in plastic bags.  Come up with a code to help you remember which posts have guns.

1340444206905618433 2020-12-20 07:49:37 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @TifanyRobb10 But with a 99.x% recovery rate why would anyone want neurotoxins, carcinogens, and possibly nanotechnology injected?  Nevermind that rna can change dna.

1340438463787745283 2020-12-20 07:26:48 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @FlocktonMark @Christi22009549 @DistortedLogo @AOC You may want to look for some peer reviewed proof of efficacy or safety for any and all vaccines.  You won't find any.  But what you will find will be PLENTY (depending on how long you search) of PROOF that vaccines cause brain damage, cancer, diabetes, GBS, autism, and more.
1340433341594669058 2020-12-20 07:06:27 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @TheRealPacoG1 @doqholliday But would it be more awful if nanotechnology is injected and at some point in time - they can simply flip a switch and turn the vaccinated into AI?  And suppose that switch makes them all turn on those closest to them?  Would that be a quicker depopulation and less noticeable?
1340432641162670082 2020-12-20 07:03:40 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @WhereIsTruth4 @doqholliday I read that the new syringes don't cause pain.  I also read that the vaccine would be delivered by the patient/person by receiving a mailed vaccine and applying it.  Works like a patch but has tiny needles that penetrate the skin... it's not supposed to be felt at all.

1340085255282286592 2020-12-19 08:03:17 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @SexCounseling I can't stop laughing at the polka dots long enough to tell.
1340084234053103617 2020-12-19 07:59:13 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @RepKinzinger How do stupid people get elected?  Oh.... that's right - the ONLY way is voter fraud and election fraud - you won't have that going forward.
1340082646639128577 2020-12-19 07:52:55 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @markrenier4 @shawnt1973 You'll have to start this from the beginning because I can not figure out how to copy links that start from the beginning.   https://t.co/kNseQBQw34
1340082157050601472 2020-12-19 07:50:58 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @markrenier4 @shawnt1973 Please learn.  The peer-review that proves all are ineffective and unsafe - if you printed it, it would stack to the ceiling.  If you look for proof of efficacy or safety in peer-review - you won't find any.  At all.  None.  Doctors are so brainwashed they won't even look.
1340044524375183360 2020-12-19 05:21:26 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @baddarze TY so much!
1340042227368816641 2020-12-19 05:12:18 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @baddarze Thanks!  Do I need to be on the home page or my profile screen.  I clicked and got the menu but delete is not an option.  Maybe it's because it's a re-tweet?  I really do need to take the time to figure twitter out since I'm addicted now.

1339690735738773508 2020-12-18 05:55:36 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @likeitor_lumpit Exactly why I don't give Panera Bread over $50 each week like I've done for over ten years now.  I tried to reason with the Manager at the Athens, GA location.  I asked her what she would do if she had been held captive and had a hand over her face.  She laughed.  Yep - laughed!
1339689508313440256 2020-12-18 05:50:43 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @Christi22009549 So sorry Christi!  I'm praying for you both!

1339449043630632961 2020-12-17 13:55:12 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @Christi22009549 I did it a little backwards... when they were young, I made them use the computer in the den... then they were teens and I let them have them behind closed doors.  They made good decisions as far as I know... but we won't discuss what I don't!  ;)
1339369982757625856 2020-12-17 08:41:02 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @Christi22009549 Very true but fortunately my homeschoolers have used it for good... lmao as I say it.  ;)

1337937918703390728 2020-12-13 09:50:32 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @mancha_perkins @WeAreTheMillies Something else that melts my heart is seeing homeschool siblings interract vs public school siblings... Public schoolers be like "you go over there, you're not old enough..." while homeschoolers be like "Y'all care if my little brother plays too?"  The dynamics are so different!
1337937370298118144 2020-12-13 09:48:21 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @mancha_perkins @WeAreTheMillies One of the best things my teen ever said to me is this:  "It's almost like they don't have anything in life to talk about except sex..."  She was comparing her homeschool friends to her soccer/church friends who are in public school.
1337926429607161856 2020-12-13 09:04:52 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @greatwhite000 @WeAreTheMillies Yes!  The lack of God allows the entry of evil.  So does the lack of a parents time &amp; attention.  Said by the Proudest Helicopter Mom you'll ever meet!  ;)
1337925815716225024 2020-12-13 09:02:26 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @mancha_perkins @WeAreTheMillies As a mom of two homeschoolers, I have to say that if you can get your children/in-laws to homeschool - you will see completely different children.  When mine were little I'd see them interact with public and private schoolers... it was so obvious.  They're being trained.
1337924951907688449 2020-12-13 08:59:00 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @WeAreTheMillies And don't forget - they create laws that protect pedophiles by giving them more rights than their victims, making manipulation tactics an easy way to completely strip the VICTIM of any and all rights.  FEAR is the devils greatest tool.  Corona proves that!

1337863305290018816 2020-12-13 04:54:02 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> Ever notice how most of the left are narcissists?  Ever notice how narcissists tend to live in the past?  Talk about the past?

1337828399377690624 2020-12-13 02:35:20 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @SheepDogSociety Yes, and nanotechnology will sit idle until the day comes when they flip a switch... those vaccinated will become AI humans and will destroy those that they love.  Just like that.  I've been told I watch too much tv but since I don't have one, I guess I read too much peer review.

1331688574358609921 2020-11-26 03:57:52 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @GodsLoveFamous True, but if the truth is hidden then how long will it take to "set us free"?  I don't watch tv but I've paid attention at my neighbor's house.  It's the twilight zone!

I hate to break it to ya - but the game playing, the fakery, the cognitive dissonance, the pretending...NONE of it will work.   The truth will prevail.  God wins!

That's the only thing that can explain the comment.  The proof is there.  For all to see.  If they want proof.  But carry on with your coloring book.

Do you know the difference in peer-review and opinion?  Have you ever read one single medical journal piece.  You think since it has such a cutsy name that it can't be real?  Wake up!

1330971610673799170 2020-11-24 04:28:54 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @anonpatriotq I guess you'll have to visit a strip joint to get a beer... or does planned parenthood have beer?  Cuz they're open too.

1330964216052854787 2020-11-24 03:59:31 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @SaveRChildrenCa I can't help but wonder why all those people in NY died.  I heard them say they've not found families for some and that some are homeless.  I have a feeling those people were murdered to induce more fear.
1330963189085982727 2020-11-24 03:55:27 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @GoodBoy10204293 @ConstableCurt That's why I'm suggesting that people read peer-reviewed science.  None of it backs up vaccinating.  We've been lied to.  This election is another example of how the masses can be so easily played.  The tv says it - the masses believe it.  Doctors are trained to lie &amp; are unaware
1330962519255552001 2020-11-24 03:52:47 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @ConstableCurt Yeah, but after 30 years of almost daily research on that one subject, I'm here to tell ya - read a few pieces of peer-review and it will forever change your stance and your mind on all medical issues.  We have been lied to for generations.
1330961994774695936 2020-11-24 03:50:42 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @GoodBoy10204293 @ConstableCurt It has NOTHING to do with being rushed and EVERYTHING to do with control.  Nanotechnology is real.  I've been reading about it since 1999.  And have you ever wondered why we have so much autoimmune issues these days?   https://t.co/QIQVUWPsWN
1330961182723813376 2020-11-24 03:47:28 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @Christi22009549 Yep... more of them showing us before attempting it.  Just to make fun and laugh at how uninterested people are in their lives, liberties, health, and justice!  They can always say we were warned!  Because we were.  We chose to sit idly by and let them destroy us.
1330960533797752832 2020-11-24 03:44:53 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @ConstableCurt Read some peer-review.  I can GUARANTEE you that if you will look for proof of efficacy or safety, your mind will be changed when you find NONE.  And please consider that no one in my generation ever died from chickenpox, mumps, or measles unless there were comorbidities.
1330959736292962305 2020-11-24 03:41:43 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @8Notables Praying that I can actually feel love cuz right now all I can feel is hate.  Yes, I said it... I hate those who fall for lies!  I do believe you have to feel love to spread it!  God help me, I'm finding that too difficult to do right now!
1330959038591492098 2020-11-24 03:38:57 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> There's already a new strain of the corona... seems that 9 patients in Australia have cv21.  Is that part of agenda 21? Also note that these people have been shutdown since May.  They've had curfew, mandatory masks, no shopping, shut down! They still have cases.  STOP THE LIES!

1329937882363080704 2020-11-21 08:01:14 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @Don_Fabbri You better back on up.   NOW!

1329538237229109258 2020-11-20 05:33:12 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> After they learn that the media lied to them, you think they may wonder if their doctors are lying too?  Do they blame the Journalists?  Or those who *control* the Journalists?
1329497841820196865 2020-11-20 02:52:41 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @davidmweissman @Jim_Jordan In other words - they're not bright enough to realize they're being lied to.

I ask if it will keep MORE mosquito's out if they install a second fence inches away from the first.  How bout a third fence - will that work?  Cuz you know... layers and all.
1327696789101830145 2020-11-15 03:35:56 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @losignal @SixQ2020 There was also a piece of peer-review stating that smokers had a better chance of survival.   Many herbs, tobacco &amp; MJ included, will cause the expulsion of crap from the lungs.  I suppose that's why.  Interesting no doubt.

1327695096138133504 2020-11-15 03:29:12 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @berryknob @AOC Then move to Venezuela and take 'it' with you!
1327693618140897280 2020-11-15 03:23:20 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @AOC Uninsured?  But isn't obamacare still available?  Why are they uninsured or underinsured - did they give all their money to the IRS as a tax penalty instead?    Socialism = loss of freedoms, deception, and tyranny.

1327518698475806720 2020-11-14 15:48:16 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @RealDrRusty Can you people not see you're being controlled by evil? A mask is a spiritual ritual that you're complying with for no damn reason.  Viruses are not even contagious!  And chain-link fences do not keep out mosquitoes!  Wake up!   https://t.co/HQYlecIra0
1327517997469151233 2020-11-14 15:45:29 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @trex554 @RealDrRusty Then stand up for your damn rights and stop wearing one!
1327517859287863296 2020-11-14 15:44:56 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @RealDrRusty On a scale of 1-10 = ZERO fear of coronaviruses.   On a scale of 1-10 = 100 wanting *it* to go away. On a scale of 1-10 = 1 kazillion ashamed of the citizens of this country for allowing doctors to feed them the lies they were fed in medical school.  satan controls the industry!
1327471504091717632 2020-11-14 12:40:44 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> Is this what adrenochrome withdrawals look like?  Her brain still seems to be functioning.    https://t.co/NHUi2CQOcF
1327330172278857728 2020-11-14 03:19:08 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @JudgeJeaninefan Journalists supporting the left aren't journalists at all, they're demon followers!
1327329487911071745 2020-11-14 03:16:25 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @JudgeJeaninefan You 'feel' like???  Who owns them?  It's pretty obvious - yeah, they've turned against America.  I hear chyna needs dirty followers - maybe they need to move there.
1327328164926922753 2020-11-14 03:11:09 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @Redistrict This entire year will go down in history as a reminder that journalists are not only bought - but are EXTREMELY STUPID followers!
1326966915017953280 2020-11-13 03:15:41 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @SixQ2020 But the split will be vast... since most of the biden voters weren't voters at all.  Even the ones that were humans *shouldn't* be voters but I digress...

Because if it's caused by cognitive dissonance then that labels every single liberal a narcissist. Could be the case!
1324855989078806530 2020-11-07 07:27:37 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @DonnaMc60877365 He's probably woke, but even if he isn't 100% woke - keep an open mind!  My guy won't be there for a while, but he's a Godsend, and yes, I keep wondering what God was thinking but we know he's always right - so there's that!  :)
1324855088683339778 2020-11-07 07:24:02 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> Blacks for biden... have you asked him why DJT was the first president to declare the kkk a terrorist organization?  Why didn't joe make that happen in all those years of power?  If you're an American?  Then you shouldn't be voting against FREEDOM!

1324797552512950272 2020-11-07 03:35:24 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @catturd2 The ONLY explanation for this level of cognitive dissonance is narcissism.  I'm convinced every damn one of the idiots on the left are narcissists.  Except for the ones that see the light and cross over (of course)!  There's no other logical explanation - they've all got NPD!
1324796811798827017 2020-11-07 03:32:28 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @LeighWells15 @bigbettyblack45 Hoping you snap out of your illusion because you've been listening to the wrong people and haven't backed anything up with facts... that's what it sounds like to me.

1324761001464573954 2020-11-07 01:10:10 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @realDonaldTrump I do hope you realize that Truthers (Activists, Patriots, whatever ya wanna call um) have been putting up with this censorship for two decades now!  If I could only have back all the time I wasted over the years.  It's time to put a STOP to it!  We love you Milania and your team!
1324440288211968003 2020-11-06 03:55:46 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> If you voted for free stuff - take note - YOUR dumbass ain't free now!  Cuz, you know... that's how capitalism works!  And I ain't talkin bout corrupt capitalism either - there's a difference dummies!

1324384246132314116 2020-11-06 00:13:04 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> Does this look photo-shopped?  Why aren't mail trucks used to transport ballots?  And the biden sticker - is that not a conflict of interest?  https://t.co/gt3nr6qLUg

1324100326618705920 2020-11-05 05:24:53 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @Stephe96 I don't know.  My stomach sank when the notification popped up about it so I came to twitter to get the scoop.  I really can't handle puking today so I couldn't watch.
1324099854835032064 2020-11-05 05:23:00 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @Cory29487101 Now why in the world would they do this?

1324037522507419650 2020-11-05 01:15:19 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @uTobian If that was the case then why did Harvard and UC Davis work so hard to bury the massive study that proved the rise in cases was NOT due to more or better testing?  Why is the study so difficult to find on the web these days?
1324036837317496836 2020-11-05 01:12:36 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @uTobian I'm not a doctor, but I've read more medical journals than any pediatrician I ever had to deal with.  Isn't there a way to get these good doctors reading the peer-review that they don't even know exist?  They don't know the truth - I was shocked to learn this!

Because you know - those pesky mosquitoes know not to travel above that 4 ft barrier!  Same way they know to only visit churches but leave the rioters alone.   Yeah, right!

1323654071702687750 2020-11-03 23:51:37 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @drdavidsamadi The real question is:  Are the current death rates keeping up with the prior years' death rates from ALL causes?

1323647823225753601 2020-11-03 23:26:47 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @PrescottYak @sanaonline__ @realDonaldTrump So.... that's how many covid deaths we had this year?  How many deaths from ALL CAUSES this year?  And last year?  And the year before?  And the year before?  And the year before?  And the year before?  And the year before?  If you're not a shill then you really should get REAL!

1322958863168131072 2020-11-02 01:49:07 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> I long for the day when people wake up and realize that satan has taken over our entire medical system. It starts in medical schools... do you know who owns, writes, edits, and publishes the textbooks?
1322958690664722432 2020-11-02 01:48:25 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> God put every plant on this planet for a reason. Big pharma can not legally patent anything that HE made. Not without first pulverizing it into pill form, completely stripping all medicinal qualities from it.

1322956090292789248 2020-11-02 01:38:05 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> FBI sitting on tons of proof that the bidens sold this country out to the CCP. Yet on fb, there's a post stating that the FBI is investigating the people who boxed-in the biden bus. You can not make this stuff up... twilight zone!

1322345814434480129 2020-10-31 09:13:04 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @8Notables So sorry!  I was verbally assaulted and blocked-in by a women in the grocery store!
1322336743752957953 2020-10-31 08:37:02 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @MAGACovfefe711 @WellsFargo So wrong!
1322332454213033985 2020-10-31 08:19:59 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @MAGACovfefe711 @WellsFargo This same story gets repeated constantly across this nation every single day... thieves getting more cocky as time goes by.  I had a client who lost a childhood home because she let the x live in it - it became the legal residence of the gf who stole from him.

1322205518807605248 2020-10-30 23:55:35 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @redwins3_first Because their tv's told them to.

If you've not spent your entire life living from check to check then you'll find it hard to understand.  When every aspect of your life is dependent on money - and you're self-employed then your time is also controlled.
1322059003178999809 2020-10-30 14:13:23 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @RealDrRusty One has makeup on, one doesn't.  Same demon though!

1322030008018309120 2020-10-30 12:18:10 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @dbongino Is there a spammer on your facebook or is the Keitu thing legitimate?  I don't have tv, so I have no clue what it is.
1321879561387286528 2020-10-30 02:20:21 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @ShelbyTalcott @ElijahSchaffer Anyone else looking for white trash but not wanting to mention it?  I love all skin colors but I despise thieves - I don't care what color they are!
1321878363825442819 2020-10-30 02:15:35 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @NicholeCordovas Or when you've been cloned.
1321877197779587072 2020-10-30 02:10:57 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @2sly4i Does this work if their hand wasn't actually on you - but on their shopping cart, while pushing their shopping cart into your shopping cart while yakking about you not wearing a mask?  By the grace of God someone removed her before I became violent. I will STAND UP FOR MY RIGHTS!
1321875271428046851 2020-10-30 02:03:18 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @JamesHu94283365 That's what ours looks like too!  Lush and beautiful but scary!

1321874510505775104 2020-10-30 02:00:17 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> Put my absentee ballot straight in the ballot box instead of mailing it!
1321862255554777088 2020-10-30 01:11:35 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @realDonaldTrump Well hopefully it's not their very own government doing the terrorizing.

Nothing fake about them.  You are delusional if you think the cognitive dissonance is gonna work this time.

How 'bout you and Nancy get together and pay for the destruction they allowed to happen to their cities/states!
1321655167834591232 2020-10-29 11:28:41 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @QImwith Read others saying the same.

1321579175149490176 2020-10-29 06:26:43 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @BobsLessons Some vaccines transmit the disease for up to 28 days.  No vaccine works.  God gave us an immune system and the devil came along and found a way to destroy it!  Who do you think wrote all those medical textbooks that rarely agree with peer-review?  satan
1321576224800518145 2020-10-29 06:15:00 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> Activists have had paypal/merchant accounts revoked, censored on fb &amp; twitmo'd for over a decade now.  Reddit, youtube, even email providers are in on it, pinterest, etsy, amazon, even craigslist... doctors and scientists have been silenced throughout history.   It needs to stop!
1321569698673287169 2020-10-29 05:49:04 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @HollieRaeSmith Did they cut off her adrenochrome?
1321569116654895111 2020-10-29 05:46:45 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> I was verbally assaulted in the grocery store today.  She left with her masked teeth intact.

1321566969821356038 2020-10-29 05:38:13 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> If you‚Äôre an American then stand up and take that stupid mask off of your face!  Have some dignity ‚Äì refuse to be part of a satanic ritual!  And for the sake of creation ‚Äì STOP THE PRETENDING!
1321509647946272768 2020-10-29 01:50:27 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @Jessie23RN @SixQ2020 Same here.  I just started using my account and I seem to lose more followers than I gain - every day lately!
1321509408359260162 2020-10-29 01:49:30 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @SixQ2020 For the past ten years, I've watched as it has gotten worse gradually.  They don't typically censor peer review, but the minions are so busy censoring political posts right now that I can share vaccine truths all day long - without worry!
1321507843401539595 2020-10-29 01:43:16 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @ssn720 @HollieRaeSmith Except the car needs police decals and flames coming out the back - and it should be upsidedown.  Cult members should have wide meth eyes and colorful hair... humping the ground.
1321504089788862464 2020-10-29 01:28:22 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @JuliansRum Hillary?  She was spawn from it!
1321503761647521792 2020-10-29 01:27:03 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @realDonaldTrump I want to hear them call it what it is - a biological weapon created by fauci and gates on behalf of the cult!  Why can't we just GET REAL and call a spade a damn spade???
1321502924971888640 2020-10-29 01:23:44 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @realDonaldTrump No, they're not.  And what are we gonna do about it???

How stupid do you need to be to believe that a virus is contagious?  How dense do you need to be to ignore the fact that biden was in bed with the ccp?
1321126509810241537 2020-10-28 00:27:59 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> Maybe now the IRS will stop giving out so much money to people with non-existent dependents!  Drivers Licenses is only one of the many ways they're doing it. - nobama shoulda never won the first time!!!

1320912950870364160 2020-10-27 10:19:23 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @SenGillibrand Just cuz you can tell that lie certainly doesn't make it true.  You need some new lies because MOST Americans are for life, love, and liberty - not death, hate, and slavery!
1320910786663993345 2020-10-27 10:10:47 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @1blantdaddy My account sat idle for years - I need followers but haven't asked because I got the feeling some were shills who were asking for followers.  Then I saw half my list disappear.  Wow!  Now I know!
1320910258764681216 2020-10-27 10:08:41 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @McKaylaRoseJ I've noticed.

1319866370688012291 2020-10-24 13:00:39 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @jodeekcp4 @JackONeil9 @bma3421 Because they lied about them being their kids?  How many middle-easterners do you think pose as South Americans and learn Spanish as their first language just to be planted on US soils?   Those people don't cut their ties with their children.  Neither do Catholics.  Wake up.
1319865580413923329 2020-10-24 12:57:30 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @realDonaldTrump If you're not going to do an EO to help people, then can you use the SBA money to fund those of us in the cue already?  You do know that the EIDL advance money was sucked right up by the wealthy politicians and celebrities before the rest of us had a chance?
1319463544220508163 2020-10-23 10:19:58 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> I think there should be a new rule for all debates - you cannot speak of the past.  Only answer the question and describe what you'll do in the FUTURE.  This is disgusting!
1319453444084826112 2020-10-23 09:39:49 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> I'm worried for my country.  This is shameful.  It's disgraceful.  It's embarrassing.  A debate over a bunch of pretenses???  Seriously?  I'm embarrassed that the likes of biden served in such a high office and is on the stage tonight!  We can do better.  This is pathetic.

1318250039240724488 2020-10-20 01:57:55 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @ZsasiZen Wow.  You're putting words in my mouth.  I can't answer your questions about the other 'gods' that you believe in.  I don't communicate with them, can't think of a single reason why I'd want to either.  I know my one true 'version' is real because I communicate with my Savior.

You should hear him speak - that way you don't have to worry about the lies.  You'll be wondering why what he says from his own mouth is not the same as what you hear from tv and other liberals.
1318228811880824834 2020-10-20 00:33:34 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @CharriseLane @realDonaldTrump So great to see intelligence among our youth!

1318226249924444161 2020-10-20 00:23:24 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @realTrumpForce Yes!  But I sure could enjoy it more if not for worrying about my business!  I had productive plans for that EIDL Advance I didn't get!  Yeah, seems the SBA thought that rich politicians spouses' and celebrities needed it more!

Saw my first biden and harris sign.  Two doors down had a BLM sign.  In favor of murdering black babies but the audacity to put a BLM sign on their porch?

1318222701455155200 2020-10-20 00:09:18 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @dawg_tri @SixQ2020 I'm hoping there will be a Trump vaccine that is not even a vaccine at all but a placebo instead.... that way they can do an actual scientific study using an actual placebo... did you know that the placeboes used in most trials are not even real placebos?  Do the research!
1318221843766124550 2020-10-20 00:05:53 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @originalBRKLYNG @SixQ2020 But with today's vaccines, the damage doesn't rear its ugly head until much later.
1318221306203176960 2020-10-20 00:03:45 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @SixQ2020 I refuse to get ANY vaccine because neither efficacy or safety has been proven in peer-review.  Besides, God gave me this neat little thing called an "immune system" and I've actually learned how to feed the thing!  My never-vaxed 15 yr old has never seen a doctor - not once!

1317284203717971968 2020-10-17 10:00:02 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @POTUS  How is court-packing any different than vaccine court?  Are you aware that this one issue has its own special court?  Did you know that VAERS reports less than 10% of actual cases?  Did you know that few have the means to hire lawyers who will stand up against big pharma?
1316921859716321280 2020-10-16 10:00:13 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @GeorgePapa19 Not so much down as OVER... we need to take it over!
1316921319833935874 2020-10-16 09:58:04 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @drdavidsamadi @Dialmond I am.  But it's hard when I look around and notice how few stand up for their rights.  And it's depressing when I look at all the masked faces.  And it's extremely infuriating when it's suggested that I wear one too.  It's DISGRACEFUL that the US is living in fear!

We've already got lobbyists destroying small businesses with their idiotic regulations.  Small Businesses NEED protection from idiots.

1316442464950128641 2020-10-15 02:15:16 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @JustinGrayWSB You know... this just goes to show - find those fake voters from elections past at the same damn place you'll find the fake humans who have walked-away with kabillions!!!  of taxpayer dollars!  Courtesy of the IRS.
1316440551907045376 2020-10-15 02:07:40 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @JustinGrayWSB Thinking people are concerned that the left may try to pull some dangerous stunt on election day so they don't want to be in line on that day!  They don't trust mail-in voting... it's disgraceful - that's what it is!  This is supposed to be the land of the free!!!

I got over a dozen, not a single one of them looked the same.  I filled one out, set it aside, then noticed the obvious - they need to be shredded before trashing!  How many are worried about the polls being safe?

I kept asking her to tell me why she hates him and then back it up.  The line where he used the p word was all she could come up with.  She tried to use the liberal lies.  Tried.
1314713311884255232 2020-10-10 07:44:14 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @zach4vikings No.  My 15 yr old is arguing with her liberal friends though, and it didn't help.  At.  All.  She sent me two Bible verses that suggest we shouldn't use foul language.  But the man has got to be so fed up!  Who can blame him???

For just a minute‚Ä¶ it makes me ashamed to be an American!  Then, I remember the Patriots and our President!  God Bless Us All!

Most people would be a little freaked out if they knew more about the lockdowns happening in other supposedly "free" countries!  It's downright unAmerican to support socialism!!!
1314435186428448769 2020-10-09 13:19:04 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @CorrieLdn I believe we had it in November of last year!  We weren't wearing a mask then - not gonna wear one now!  I trust the innate abilities and design of the immune system...  Our Creator designed it to protect us - big pharma doesn't like that... threatens their income!
1314392543078109185 2020-10-09 10:29:37 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @likeitor_lumpit That's typical for my publix too.  Aldi on the otherhand - that's stressful!  I'm avoiding Panera Bread and DSW Shoes over being assaulted by the mask police.  Nicely of course, still caused stress!
1314391873474224128 2020-10-09 10:26:57 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @likeitor_lumpit My subconsciousness somehow wants to test this theory every single time I take my unmasked self into the produce section of the grocery store.  So sick of the stress!  And the time it takes to shop now!  I want my life back!

1312608880468295680 2020-10-04 12:21:58 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @GentryjaxVicki @realDonaldTrump Because the pharmacult cannot patent anything made by God.  Not without first pulverizing it into a pill form; thus rendering it useless.

1312562457328705537 2020-10-04 09:17:30 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> Y'all really should read the conclusion to this study before you think about taking the cult's vaccines.  Then look at a very long list of "autoimmune disorders" and wonder what the cause is.  Is OCD, ADD, Autism, Allergies ... ... ... also "autoimmune disorders"?
1312560511737880576 2020-10-04 09:09:46 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @MarcusTriton @AnonymousSage1 Awesome!  One thing this country needs more than ever right now is intelligent, patriot-doctors thinking outside the pharma-box!
1312541953419075590 2020-10-04 07:56:02 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @MarcusTriton @AnonymousSage1 Do you believe that they actually have a 'contagious' coronavirus?
1312540792528015361 2020-10-04 07:51:25 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @likeitor_lumpit And why were all those prisoners set free?  Couldn't they just hand them all a mask?
1312436260028461063 2020-10-04 00:56:02 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @realDonaldTrump We love you both!  Praying for you!

1311843666781253633 2020-10-02 09:41:17 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @rabbitulane @ShellyMBoulder @CDCgov Just because you and the fear-mongering fools don't read the peer-review, and don't bother looking for the peer-review... doesn't mean the peer-review does not exist!  It does!  Start with pubmed, then BMJ, then JAMA, then look at ear, nose and throat journals.  Open your eyes!
1311842071452569602 2020-10-02 09:34:57 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @PiperK @ChuckCallesto You have one of those chainlink fences around your back yard to keep mosquitos out?  I hope they told you the 4' high fence doesn't work... but the 5' high DOES work.  But only if you're an idiot.  Mosquitoes be gone!
1311841019957309440 2020-10-02 09:30:46 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @ChuckCallesto If a person gets a flu shot, they are being injected with a coronavirus.  A cold is a coronavirus.  People get colds.  Often.  The tests are not capable of strain detection.
1311838654260805632 2020-10-02 09:21:22 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @realDonaldTrump  Wallace has to go!    https://t.co/g6m5ku9frz
1310035494483435520 2020-09-27 09:56:15 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @ImAwakeRU72 Also, most of them are followers - they don't know how to think for themselves, certainly not step outside the boxes of their government school educations (I think that's where I learned to be a good little democrat).
1310034765249155074 2020-09-27 09:53:21 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @ImAwakeRU72 It wasn't a choice - but possessed.  I met my first narcissist a few years back.  I'd call him evil.  I start questioning how he got that way... what made him evil?  That's when I began to see that the devil is the creator of narcissism.

1309559041132298243 2020-09-26 02:23:00 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @DatBeachBoy @ClayTravis @WhitlockJason Likely because he knew the polls were rigged until DJT took care of that little problem!  Maybe someone should tell him!
1309298329252225025 2020-09-25 09:07:01 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @JRubinBlogger That's hilarious... you need to turn the tv off!
1308883159828885504 2020-09-24 05:37:17 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @M2Madness @mickym3333 I keep wondering what issues the democrats are running on.  Every ad has been a plea for money so they can "get rid of" Trump.  Do they even have any issues?  I *tried* to look at the tax plan of biden's but it made me feel shame for my country... this is the twilight zone!

1308880366103560194 2020-09-24 05:26:11 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @jsolomonReports That trash is designed to destroy the immune system!  How much a follower do you need to be to believe in vaccines without ever ONCE looking for studies on efficacy and safety?  This company knowingly pushes their products onto babies and they don't care that it's carcinogenic!
1307509902559059969 2020-09-20 10:40:27 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @QTAnon1 I was living in my Mama's womb when JFK died.  Was set free in June... then 2020 happened.

Just like the democrats have changed, so have republicans - and for the better.  We have a businessman in office - not a politician.
1307089571155451904 2020-09-19 06:50:12 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @catturd2 I'm 56 and I can assure you - scholastic indoctrination was happening when I was a kid too.  It just wasn't as obvious.  We were definitely trained to be good little democrats.  We found logic as we aged - some of us at least!
1307088952986345472 2020-09-19 06:47:45 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> I got groceries today - hassle-free!  No mask police, but lots and lots of dirty looks... Do you ever wonder if your cashier is making the connection:  No mask... cart full of whole, organic food?
1306678475185696771 2020-09-18 03:36:40 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @FergusWarrene @realDonaldTrump I'm willing to guess you're not just pretending to be ignorant.  It's pathetic that MOTHERS know so much more than your typical MD when it comes to vaccines.  If you saw all the medical journals you don't know exist - you'd realize how pathetic it is!  Pathetically evil.
1306672430430277632 2020-09-18 03:12:38 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @Liz_Wheeler Don't worry.  You take that vaccine and you likely won't feel like going to the theatre a year later.  Nothing good can possibly come from injecting carcinogens, neurotoxins, adjuvants, heavy metals, and foreign dna into your body.  Unless chronic illness is the goal.

1306294758562836482 2020-09-17 02:11:54 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @HelfertLynne @HSRetoucher Why would you inject any of that when you can ingest it?  The brainwashing has got everyone thinking that injecting shit is some sort of powerful... it ain't.  But ya know what is?  Ingesting what God created to nourish our bodies!  THAT is how to PREVENT the corona.  :)
1306293351763922952 2020-09-17 02:06:19 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @Hoosiers1986 They had help from satan himself.
1306291126513676288 2020-09-17 01:57:28 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @TrumpRulzz It already happened here in the US!  Trump did it - removes all assets and some who are charged with crimes against humanity are sentenced and cannot return back to this country after being released.  That's paying for part of NESARA-with the assets seized from cult members.
1306290322155151360 2020-09-17 01:54:17 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> As each day rolls by... The clones seem to be gettin' a little less human.  Am I the only one noticing this?

1305709258269487104 2020-09-15 11:25:20 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @gerryflood8 @realDonaldTrump Coming from a mask-wearer it makes sense that you would be so impatient and ignorant.  How bout you snap your fingers and make it all better in an instant?  Oh and call your local news so you can be seen sharing such ignorance on the dummy tube.
1305708923614310400 2020-09-15 11:24:00 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @mskristinawong @realDonaldTrump What planet are you living on???  That's the most hysterically laughable, ignorant comment I've ever seen... are you living under a rock?  Ever watched a press conference?  Ever?

1305707050714923008 2020-09-15 11:16:34 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @reaIDonTrump45 Never had it - never will.  Which is why my children are not addicted to the dummy tube!  tv is the tool of the devil!
1305706350169686018 2020-09-15 11:13:47 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @reaIDonTrump45 I would add to that "love" but of course, it only needs to be taught at home since the sort of "love" being taught by freaks in our schools today is APPALLING!  Can't you do something about CA passing these f'd up laws that hurt kids? Those laws make me ashamed to be an American!

But it is a demonic activity and doctors instructing patients to wear them is evil.  Stand up to the PTB unless they are known to be issuing instruction from God!
1305702389660475392 2020-09-15 10:58:03 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @FergusWarrene @reaIDonTrump45 And remember - judges are not doctors and doctors are not gods. ND's come a little closer to being God-Like and they're even more true to good works than ANY MD or GP  on the planet!
1305701582072410112 2020-09-15 10:54:50 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @FergusWarrene @reaIDonTrump45 satan loves it when good people twist scripture!  Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, 2 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.
1305701048137461760 2020-09-15 10:52:43 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @homen2 @FergusWarrene @reaIDonTrump45 Some allow trickery.  And some use words to pretend a verse means something it does not.  KJV does not say that ALL PTB are ordained by God.  We know that obviously not all are.  Lack of the word "all" can be used for evil.  Details matter dude!
1305699555430879232 2020-09-15 10:46:47 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @tiffanyxspears @prettyxpixie Hugs!  I did too... an easy trap to fall into.  Look for empathy anytime you meet a guy.  True, they can and will fake it - but be attentive to that one thing and you'll meet the one who will your perfect pick!  It happened for me so I know it can for you too!

1305690265156546560 2020-09-15 10:09:52 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @prettyxpixie Intelligence and empathy tend to be two traits that attract narcissists so be aware... and do what I do - play dumb.  It helps if you're hair is blonde.  ;)
1305685515824496640 2020-09-15 09:51:00 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @FergusWarrene @reaIDonTrump45 I'm sure you're no different than most doctors.  You intend to do good but you've been trained to do the devil's deeds and you cannot discern between good and evil.  Let me help you out here - God made it, it's good.  Man took God's work and pulverized it into greed - NOT GOOD.
1305685144766943234 2020-09-15 09:49:31 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @FergusWarrene @reaIDonTrump45 If your government is made up of the cult then you believe your God wants you to submit to the cult?  My God does not.  The word "good" in that verse should not be ignored -My God CLEARLY tells me to seek truth in the KJV!  What if you were trained by satan?  What.  If.
1305682795239485440 2020-09-15 09:40:11 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> @reaIDonTrump45 Absolutely, and although my 2 never stepped foot in a public school - I'd say that what needs to be taught there are the three R's only.  Children do not need kevin jennings type training, nor do they need common core.  Our generation learned to have sex WITHOUT being 'schooled'!
1305681697623683075 2020-09-15 09:35:49 +0800 <AbitcrunchyDana> "Pfizer CEO says drug company will know if COVID-19 vaccine works before the end of October"  By "works" do they mean it's going to cause brain damage, cancer, and chronic illnesses like ALL THE REST do?  satan designed this filth y'all!  Put your trust in God instead!

Maybe the jolt of reality will help them to recognize that they've been conditioned, played, brainwashed, indoctrinated, lied to... (as we all have).

I noticed recently that I've blocked so many lefties posting on Trump's post that now about half or more of the comments are gone... betting those are mostly paid shills.
