1338973054739877889 2020-12-16 06:23:47 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> You know when you think someone’s genuine about learning and you take time to share info but they turn out to just want to score cheap points?  Well this troll is exactly that 👇👇👇
1338972643547082752 2020-12-16 06:22:09 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> @TheGard15289561 None of the above
1338972354114973696 2020-12-16 06:21:00 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> @Joe_C_London Ok. I see you’re just after scoring points   Go bother someone else
1338972012035923968 2020-12-16 06:19:39 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> @Joe_C_London All I’m telling you is that the FP issue is HUGE - based on calculations of eminent scientists  And I told you that I, as a scientist, don’t believe FN is a factor when spinning at such high CT &amp; when dealing with such a low prevalence sample  Now, go &amp; do your own research
1338969942524358657 2020-12-16 06:11:25 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> @Joe_C_London How am I avoiding it? I answered as best I can in the absence of data from the Govt
1338969566333038593 2020-12-16 06:09:56 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> @Joe_C_London Not clear what point you’re making?   I told you I don’t know the FN number because it’s not been released by Govt  I’ve been as clear as I can with you  Thought you were genuine in your interest in the subject  Are you just out for a typical Twitter argument?  If so, we’re done
1338968224851955715 2020-12-16 06:04:36 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> @Joe_C_London No. Just a logical enquiry will show you that that can’t be the case  At a CT above 25, you pick up all viral remnants (infectious and non infectious). We’re spinning closer to 45  Also, with a low prevalence, your pool of potential false negatives is contained within that low %
1338966430990159877 2020-12-16 05:57:28 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> @Joe_C_London Please don’t turn this into a combative discussion or be rude  I told you I don’t know number because the Govt has not released it  I’ve shared with you what former VP and Chief Scientist for Respiratory at Pfizer has said  Now, do your own research if you’re not happy with it
1338965684555030528 2020-12-16 05:54:30 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> Oh boy. Another 3 follower account pipes up to say they happen to know 5 of the 300 or so young healthy people who’ve died of Covid   Miraculous   👇
1338964754157723651 2020-12-16 05:50:48 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> @Joe_C_London It’s in the final section   And this is his earlier analysis which he mentions in the article I shared and which shows the calculation in more details    https://t.co/rdoAklNGaY
1338962249600348163 2020-12-16 05:40:51 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> @Joe_C_London He addressed it in article  Again, Govt hasn’t released numbers  But when you spin over 35ct as Govt is doing, will pick up all viral material (infectious or not), so unlikely many if any missed (FN)  Also, FN’s a problem when dealing w high prevalence, but that’s not case here

1338957063138004992 2020-12-16 05:20:15 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> @Joe_C_London Well, problem is that, unbelievably, Govt refuses to publish the error rate   So, we have eminent scientists to rely on, like Dr Yeadon, who estimate that due to low prevalence in sample, FP rate can be as high as 93%  Here’s how it’s calculated    https://t.co/dZ8ZC3PD6k

This has to be a careful decision based on age/risk factors   For example, young with no co-morbidities should avoid this experimental inadequately tested vaccine

A new variant that we should be fearful of, but somehow the vaccine developed for the other variant still works for this new variant (probably) so keep injecting that experimental concoction into your bodies, little people

I’m telling people that they must carefully examine the risk/reward equation   To even offer this experimental vaccine to the healthy young of whom only 300 have died since the start (go see Govt’s own figures) is tantamount to medical negligence

A vaccine can be part of it  You will not reach herd immunity just with a vaccine that will not have uptake you expect - people are rightly wary of pumping an inadequately tested experimental vaccine into their bodies

You’re equating two separate issues   Just because there’s a risk from a virus doesn’t mean you ignore risk from synthetic vaccine. Do you understand that?  Virus poses a VERY LOW RISK to those under 70 with no co-morbidities  Whereas vaccine poses UNKNOWN risk to EVERYONE

1334070475765460994 2020-12-02 17:42:41 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> @LisaFrideborg I doubt many would take this highly experimental vaccine now, after such a short period of testing, if they actually examined the information for themselves   Alas, many will simply follow instructions from Govt - but that’s their choice

No mandating as the Govt is hinting   On the MMR vaccine. That was not experimental and was the usual injection of part of or deactivated pathogen for body to get used to and was tested extensively
1334063062614204417 2020-12-02 17:13:14 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> @PhillTait @_G1ngerSn1ps_ Again, just as w flu vaccine, it must be a personal choice  I don’t know what they’ll decide, but I will advise to hold off until we see longer term effects  It’s unlike any other vaccine. It’s experimental mRNA vaccine that’s only been tested for 6 or so mnths -far too short IMO

If Covid is on death cert with flu or pneumonia, that death is counted as Covid, or any death within 28 days of positive test - that’s why excess deaths are most reliable  But even on Covid, no second wave - just seasonal flux

If it’s just mRNA in there, all it should do is instruct ribosomes to make viral material - it shouldn’t do anything to DNA  But inserting synthetic mRNA into the body is itself hugely novel &amp; highly experimental - that’s why this short testing cycle is so worrying

1328724813951721473 2020-11-17 23:40:56 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> @RMillennielle I know PCR tests are extremely unreliable - see Dr Yeadon’s piece below suggesting over 90% false positives when testing asymptomatic masses  Lateral flow tests appear to be more reliable - but don’t have data, perhaps someone else does   https://t.co/rdoAklNGaY
1328723044601368584 2020-11-17 23:33:54 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> @RMillennielle Test only tells you whether you have viral RNA (infectious or not) at momen of testing, so if you get negative it’s no longer accurate as soon as you leave test facility  Also, if you get positive, given error rate, may well be false positive (I’m assuming you have no symptoms)

If this was a virus with a high death rate, you’d be very concerned about false negatives, but it’s not, so social and economic price of false positives is too high  False positives lead to lockdown of whole communities, job decimation and other health risks - for no reason
1315338562427117569 2020-10-12 01:08:45 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> @HelenRSalisbury I actually thought the country voted for a Conservative government and not this big state micromanager of our lives that’s trampling over the rule of law and our hard won liberties in the name of virus, that according to ONS, infects 0.4% of us and has killed fewer 0.06% of pop

1315328216123539463 2020-10-12 00:27:38 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> @PrincessStarli @elonmusk @toadmeister But that’s exactly how immunity has operated for centuries; shield vulnerable &amp; allow others to get on w life w sensible proportionate precautions  Never before have we locked down whole societies in fear of a virus, especially one that’s killed fewer than 0.06% of pop in US &amp; UK

This is not the plague   It has a relatively low mortality rate  In US it’s 180k out of 360m  In UK it’s 40k out of 70m  If someone has a condition that makes them vulnerable they should be shielded  BUT there is no sense in locking everyone else up

1303248292558581760 2020-09-08 16:26:20 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> This is a terrific way to put in context the ‘rise’ in positive PCR tests (which have many false positives anyway)   Great graphic, Ben 👍

1303245718279331843 2020-09-08 16:16:07 +0800 <FunTimeFred1> @ProfKarolSikora Why do you think it is that the government is not acknowledging that deaths have remained below trend and ICU capacity at peak for weeks, and instead focus on PCR test results which they know are throwing up high numbers of false positives?

He simply asserted his rights  He was not placed under arrest before he was manhandled and sprayed
