1343993968699305984 2020-12-30 02:55:06 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @WelshBrexiteer0 I suspect Twitter puts a 'cross' against certain accounts that they do not like &amp; dampen down the exposure they get. Eg how can 100 retweet a comment, then suddenly no more? Also, they try to keep us in a group of the like minded to stop views that they do not like from spreading
1343992907745939463 2020-12-30 02:50:54 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @betterworld80 @sainsburys Do you think other races are inclusive? Are you joking, try going to Somalia &amp; telling them to be inclusive &amp; treat you as they treat each other. You will soon find the meaning of REAL racism. These ppl will do the same here when a majority. Maybe you already know that &amp; want it?

Best thing a Fox gov would do would be to force a fairer MSM &amp; internet (via purging the double-stndards legal system of the enemy-within) &amp; this alone would enable the massive current AWAKENING to continue.
1343988148347527176 2020-12-30 02:31:59 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @London19721 @nastymutant @PatAlternative I completely agree, but the Right need bigger numbers. I only suggest that say(!) Fox was PM &amp; govt was similar to his views, not like MrsT surrounded by traitors, then this would enable all sorts of changes that would favour the right. Repatriation would be further down the line
1343949834257100800 2020-12-29 23:59:44 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @London19721 @nastymutant @PatAlternative Correct, but we never had a Tory party that actually wanted to shift to the right, &amp;  https://t.co/QvAdG0WBdg's might just do that. Eg Mrs T was surrounded by Soames,Carrington,Major,May, Hesletine,Clarke etc. Depends if they can corrupt Fox's party like they did UKIP &amp; Cons

If UKIP had got in, that would then be the 'middle ground'
1343940458934841347 2020-12-29 23:22:29 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @nastymutant DM - the paper that replaced Katie Hopkins with Piers-show-some-respect-Morgan. The paper that at the last GE banned any reader from commenting on any 'moderated' article if he mentioned UKIP favourably. Although the odd corner of sanity still exists whilst the purge continues.
1343938273648009217 2020-12-29 23:13:48 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @JuliaHB1 @nastymutant 377 ppl died and 'all healthy'. I suspect that when it comes to deaths after a vaccine, they will try a lot harder to prove such patients were 'not healthy'.  A person or organisation (eg NHS) that wants a certain outcome (to justify closing down services) will twist the data.
1343886032878579712 2020-12-29 19:46:13 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Robert_Purse @goddersbloom I am surprised the deaths this year are not higher considering the NHS abandoned their posts big time &amp; sent the cancer patients etc home. Also, suicides are up.  When the swamp is drained, we can confiscate the ill-gotten gains from the corrupt.  Why are drs being paid to skive?
1343883618112987136 2020-12-29 19:36:37 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @GerardBattenUK For every doctor that is in the MSM, I am sure if we went to their Twitter profile we would find the usual - pro EU, 'anti-racism', Ext-R, BLM even, anti-Trump, NHS-worshipper etc  NHS can never reformed whilst the msm covers for them - eg not printing current absenteeism levels.

I am sure they look a lot harder in the case of those dying after the vaccine.  They should also test the ones with 'no underlying conditions' for vit D levels &amp; levels of other minerals &amp; vitamins.

Might a high one show the NHS God in a bad light possibly? Is it even higher than the teachers' level?

Many £million pound houses will be bought this year from Chinese bribes. And how many became millionaires by handing Bridgend steel to China? &amp; HS2?
1343656775996813313 2020-12-29 04:35:13 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @themood2020 Unfortunately, this govt would put Tommy Robinson on trial and the 'jury of his peers' would all be mslms needing a translator each. Trial by jury would be, in the hands of this govt, trial by race.  A bit like the OJ Simpson trial was -  guilty or not according to race.

1343652129337208836 2020-12-29 04:16:46 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> 'The Winslow Boy' film from the 40s is about entitlement to a fair trial (MagnaC). There is a sub-plot about having to choose between 'career' and 'right'. In the film, Sir Robert chose 'right' and lost his promotion to Lord Chief Justice. Farage is choosing the promotion option.
1343649869525901312 2020-12-29 04:07:47 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom Re trial of OJ Simpson - they decide guilty/not guilty based  on your race. Same here, where "a jury of one's peers" could mean a trial in Birmingham by a jury of mslms all needing translators. Imagine Tommy Robinson on trial. This is how the govt would implement 'jury of peers'.
1343648123374153731 2020-12-29 04:00:51 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom A Nobel prize for the first 'scientist' that can merge the two theories. Or at least a huge grant, or govt contract or a position on a charity's board (a rich 'charity', funded by the govt), or a knighthood.  Covid hoax gets married to Climate Change Hoax

1343644345279406081 2020-12-29 03:45:50 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom It might be instructive to measure Vit D levels of those who react badly 'without underlying issues' - and not just for Covid but to flu

I read they were 30-40% at one time. What are they now? Govt must know them but will they not release figures, or will msm not publish them, as no criticism of the NHS God is allowed?

Once ppl were proud to say they had a police officer in the family - now they are ashamed as the police have switched sides (like the DM did).
1343603159198019589 2020-12-29 01:02:10 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @GerardBattenUK Just look at this! Her elderly relative clearly did NOT have Covid &amp; the dr tried to put it down as cause of death.

1343577166559240192 2020-12-28 23:18:53 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> 'The Winslow Boy' from the 1940s is an excellent film. It is about a 'nobody' demanding a fair trial before being convicted. In the end (a) he got a jury trial by his peers (b) it shows how the lawyer who believed in right was, because of this, excluded from the top job.

The NHS goes out of its way to mark deaths down as 'Covid-related', even getting away with 'within 28 days'.

1343530075094999048 2020-12-28 20:11:46 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Govt can get away with any lie on issues where the MSM shares the same agenda.

I think he enjoyed it. As a young man he took huge risks with his own life, charging on horseback at the enemy, &amp; he later ordered his men to do the same, to their deaths. Maybe had psychopathic tendencies.

A bit like War Propaganda in times of actual war. The govt &amp; msm are engaged in a cold, silent, prolonged war/struggle against the ppl and their propaganda lies are part of this.

Their motive is that they want Britain to be dominated &amp; controlled by those hostile to us, who will prevent us from preserving our ways &amp; who will bring on our destruction.

They did it to you because they know the legal system will fully support them, whereas against a BLM type the legal system would not.

Not because they obey the govt, but, as with climate change, they sing from the same hymn book.

The internet period of freedom (a few decades so far) is enabling the ppl to wake up at a rapid rate. The Js cannot stop this from happening at present.

1341458001685868545 2020-12-23 02:58:05 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @wrathofgnon @RGoldblatzberg I spoke to a butcher about 20 yrs ago &amp; he said the same. The old wooden boards that they used to use before plastic were more hygienic because as they scrubbed them clean, the top layer got worn away.
1341457138007339011 2020-12-23 02:54:39 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @NickGriffinBU @RGoldblatzberg ... and no increased death total this year despite the extra deaths caused by the NHS abandoning their posts. Why does MSM not print the record absenteeism levels in the NHS? It was 30-40% a while ago, but they must have the up to date figures. Is it too sacred to be criticised?
1341455087244365831 2020-12-23 02:46:30 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> We also need the figures for TOTAL flu/cold/coronavirus deaths this year and 5 yr average, and also the figures without the new '28 days-yes, add them' rule, plus absenteeism levels in the NHS for each month.

1341317900179804163 2020-12-22 17:41:22 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @lokshensoupjek @Roydini25 @SionGruffudd The authorities just issued a coin saying 'Diversity Built Britain'. Therefore the official view now comes from marxist politics and not from actual data. This applies to scientific topics as well as historical ones.
1341315566779441154 2020-12-22 17:32:06 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @AntonyEmms @Roydini25 @BorisJohnson Certainly there do not seem to be debates in parliament then votes. I thought that was supposed to be the system. It seems more just rule by marxist 'scientific advisors'. Have they got some hold over Johnson or is he in on it all? Inviting 3m Chinese over suggests he is in on it
1341314997100679168 2020-12-22 17:29:50 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @kerry_moakes @Roydini25 They could end the nonsense if they wanted to &amp; still save face by claiming that the lockdowns worked &amp; we can get back to normal. They could interpret the figures to 'prove' this as clearly they are expert at making them prove anything they want to already.
1341313440409931776 2020-12-22 17:23:39 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @johnredwood Because the govt &amp; MSM are more interested in FAKESTATS than they are in figures presented in context.

1341011076494880768 2020-12-21 21:22:10 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom It is strange how an MP has to resign over naming another driver to take his or her speeding points, but not over peddling fake science to close down the economy.
1341010631810572290 2020-12-21 21:20:24 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @DickDelingpole @goddersbloom Their 'help' reminds me of when the bank closes your account over a technicality or your credit limit is reduced and they say at the end of the call: 'Is there anything else I can help you with today?'
1341009876483530753 2020-12-21 21:17:23 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom This French hostility is a win win for Britain: a) Presses the right buttons on the British to activate their patriotism &amp; (correctly)view the EU as hostile b) Prompts Britain to be less dependent on the EU and to make trading deals with other nations (pushes us away from the EU)

Why does the msm never publish the figures? It is if the NHS are some socialist god that needs to be worshipped and cannot be criticised.
1340744556082552836 2020-12-21 03:43:06 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @MahyarTousi @curwood_graham Correct, &amp; the only reason it 'needed saving' was because it was so bloated and incompetent that the gov knew it could not cope with even a 5% increase in demand. And then on top of that, their absenteeism level (on full pay) was running at 30-40% due to mass abandoning of posts.
1340730789621882882 2020-12-21 02:48:24 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @realsb4feelings Always surprising how many rich &amp; famous happily accepted the 'hospitality' of Epstein - surely we have all seen spy films where there is a honey trap as part of the plot, or where the blackmailer has 'photos'. It is a v common plot, so why still fall for it re Epstein &amp; similar?
1340649693819392000 2020-12-20 21:26:09 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Aldeanuk The govt are happy for 100 to die from other ailments and some brought on by loneliness, in order to save just 1 from Covid, which they are likely to recover from anyway if otherwise healthy.
1340638336785014785 2020-12-20 20:41:02 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @DiamondHona @Love4Alberta The motive is not power or money, as the aim is to make us like S Africa where there is no power or money for any elite, including big tech &amp; banks. See the hatred against whites in S Africa? Same hatred in W countries against Wts coming from lefty whites. Hatred is the motive.
1340636958977089537 2020-12-20 20:35:33 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @FromoutsideAlan @Love4Alberta May never hid that she was an open border Home Sec - her constituents STILL voted for her, not UKIP. Then May did not hide that she was an open-border PM - &amp; at the GE they STILL voted for her in her constit, not Batten's UKIP.They will vote for any enemy-within standing as 'Con'
1340635758407938048 2020-12-20 20:30:47 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Love4Alberta Correct, but it is different from normal wars in that half the people just love all the government control &amp; want more of it. They want to be slaves themselves in a 1984 type state and want the govt to have even more control over their lives. They are mainly in the public sector.
1340607384100737025 2020-12-20 18:38:02 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Yet they will find you if you avoid a car parking charge of £1.00, and send the bailiffs round for a fine that will have grown to £2000. (This was one of the cases on 'Can't Pay Won't Pay' on Freevew TV).
1340606430274043904 2020-12-20 18:34:14 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @YardleyShooting They have already spent 3x the annual NHS budget on lockdowns. Could they not have just got the incompetent NHS to increase its capacity by 10% (eg open Nightingale hospitals) with an extra £100billion or so? Or is it just too incompetent even with an overpayment this magnitude?

The enemy scores many own goals (kneeling to BLM is one of them, speeding up immign when slowly, slowly was working is another) and this could be a big one as it might even wake up the complacent rich who until now managed to insulate themselves from the decline.

I remembered your comment when I came across it.  https://t.co/D3wai1qziB

1340405934686941187 2020-12-20 05:17:33 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @BevPerth You are right not to bother. To the left, their politics is all that matters, and science etc has to be denied if it contradicts their views. Eg they declare that the sexes are the same in behaviour, &amp; even Nature has to comply, &amp; they just go into denial when it clearly does not
1340403402669502467 2020-12-20 05:07:29 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @LeeHurstComic Unfortunately, most ppl fail to make the connection between the policies we have and they way they have been voting over the decades. If they did make the connection, they would realise that they have been voting for open borders etc and so are responsible for all the bad things.
1340402597824442370 2020-12-20 05:04:17 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @MickeyD44314901 @jeremypssm A 'fish war' will unite the ppl of Britain and make them view the EU as the enemy, which is a good development. Ppl are stupid and need a few buttons pressing for them to wake up, and this would press the buttons whereas at present they are letting the EU walk all over them.
1340385865009426433 2020-12-20 03:57:48 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @faystarot @PrisonPlanet I am saying why should a few heroes sacrifice themselves eg go to prison etc when the maj. are not backing them up? Eg T Robinson - huge punitive costs awarded against him from cases he should have won - where are the ppl to pay his fines? Just a few like myself, not the rich!
1340382723421196289 2020-12-20 03:45:19 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @zero_to_here_oh Also, something about forcing the Freeview TV channels to include a balance, so they are forced to a allow a channel that gives the other side on global warming, the pandemic etc
1340381070622126080 2020-12-20 03:38:44 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @LadyTrumpington @Macetrain @RichardBurgon Also, they 'work' in the public sector and lockdown is one big skive for them that they laughingly refer to as 'working from home'. A silver lining - the complacent middle class who just unthinkingly vote Tory every GE might finally wake up to realise the CONs are not on our side
1340379568104988672 2020-12-20 03:32:46 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @faystarot @PrisonPlanet The reason we 'have to submit' to fines like this is because these days the authorities including the judiciary are corrupt &amp; run by those who have no concept of right &amp; wrong or justice, &amp; will readily abuse their power inc via social workers (whilst letting off real criminals)
1340358434798100481 2020-12-20 02:08:48 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @GerardBattenUK The 'medium rich' ie those with a house worth 300-600K are at present complacent and believe immign &amp; national decline &amp; P.correctness do not matter as they are insulated personally from the decline by their £. But at some point it will hit them too and they can start to resist
1340356258935803909 2020-12-20 02:00:09 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Ianwatling3 @sapiofoxy Pay a private chiropractor. A friend developed back pain while in hospital lying flat for 2 weeks from something unrelated - NHS  did nothing &amp; discharged her in pain. She saw a private chiropractor and it was cured the same day.

1340355347362541569 2020-12-20 01:56:32 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @sapiofoxy The strange thing is how everyone would go ballistic if a politician said, for example, the 'N' word on TV, yet no-one seems bothered that tens of thousands are dying from undiagnosed cancer &amp; NHS absenteeism is at 30-40%. Priorities are all wrong, &amp; all MSM-led.
1340353824939274240 2020-12-20 01:50:29 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @JamesMelville @Charlotte3003G One of the most despicable acts of this gov was bribing the private hospitals to stay shut too.  'To get ready for Covid rush' was the excuse, but the real reason was in order to not show up the NHS that had abandoned their duties en masse.
1340352937344851970 2020-12-20 01:46:57 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @NetworksManager @goddersbloom ... and many of those 'with connections' have made millions from govt contracts in the last year. And most/many teachers &amp; doctors have had a year off on full pay; NHS absenteeism running at 30-40%, no wonder the NHS 'cannot cope'
1340351748561580032 2020-12-20 01:42:14 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @YardleyShooting The fulough bribes cannot go on forever, &amp; when the £ finally runs out, they will join the angry group. The complacent rich believe they are insulated from it all, but eventually it will affect that which is closest to their hearts - not their heritage, but their house value.

1340320299049476097 2020-12-19 23:37:15 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @faystarot @PrisonPlanet The authorities would send a swat team to his house, and put all his children in social 'care'.

As soon as the ppl realise this, they can vote differently. Sadly, they are still a long way from this stage.
1340025591081414658 2020-12-19 04:06:12 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @cursedsalad The internet is awakening ppl at a v fast rate, which is why there is a huge effort at present to control the internet as tightly as they control the rest of the MSM. Equation: Rapid decline in white society  + the ability to find out why it is happening = huge awakening going on
1340023860826148866 2020-12-19 03:59:19 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @JohnONeill1252 @cursedsalad We have to wait for the suffering to be a lot worse than it is now before the ppl start to vote differently. The Germans had to reach the starving stage and the Weimar Republic before they decided to vote diff. A lot more suffering to come before any wakening, which is a pity
1340022878042005504 2020-12-19 03:55:25 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @HHepplewhite We could now have 50+ UKIP MPs under Batten in parliament all from the last G.E. opposing open borders &amp; Foreign Aid &amp; BBC, if ppl would only drop their loyalty to the Con Party. Anyone who voted for Cons voted for OPEN BORDERS as that has been their clear policy for 10 yrs.
1340022089177329666 2020-12-19 03:52:17 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @HHepplewhite Unfortunately, the Con Party has only about 80 proper conservatives in it, and they are dominated by the others, so the Con party is therefore an OPEN BORDER &amp; a criminal-friendly Islm-loving party that only gave us the referendum v reluctantly 4ys ago (&amp; 2yrs after promising).
1340020125827813378 2020-12-19 03:44:29 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @nastymutant Boris understands this, and has decided his life will be easier and his career will run more smoothly if he just submits to those who wish us harm.
1340019307116449793 2020-12-19 03:41:13 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @TFats3000 @nastymutant @_KRAN_ There are some cultures, now with us, for which being caught grooming children is NOT a source of shame or disapproval even, within his family and community (the prophet is perfect &amp; he did it so it must be ok!) whereas in our indigenous culture this is a source of deep shame.
1339950077322903552 2020-12-18 23:06:08 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> The deliberate misinterpretation of the data by the govt/msm is not hard to spot - every year there is a Q in the Foundation Maths GCSE (the easy one) about spotting data misinterpretation errors at this basic level.
1339948700613931014 2020-12-18 23:00:39 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @DCBMEP @goddersbloom @DavidGHFrost @BorisJohnson Most of our polititns just love it when other countries walk all over us. We are the only country that sends out delegations abroad  who deliberately seek bad deals for their own country. They hardly hide their hatred of England - just listen to them on the subject of our statues
1339946842692464643 2020-12-18 22:53:16 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom Also, some wealthy ppl are very insulated from the current decline all around them and do not care, eg they live in exclusive areas, but even they will wake up when the decline hits that which is dearest to their hearts - not their country or heritage - but their house value.
1339909086964551685 2020-12-18 20:23:15 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @ThisIsREngland In the TV Freeview History programme, I think it was Jennifer Saunders ('comedian'), the presenter, who asked Maori leader 'Why were you unsuccessful in repelling the invaders?' referring to the British.  - So it is okay to use the term 'invader' but only referring to wht races.
1339907305538805763 2020-12-18 20:16:10 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Many immg do not bother to hide how they are going to treat us when they are the majority, even if our treacherous politicns want them to keep quiet until they outnumber us properly. Why do w ppl who do not want mass immg STILL vote for open border parties LibLabCon? A mystery.
1339675424226467846 2020-12-18 04:54:45 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @gewagon @henrywesto @Deckardswench Agree about Labour but most Tories now seem left wing also, apart from perhaps 80, and even these ones are being dominated by the others at present. Too many Sourbry types - Hesletine, Clarke, Major, May - Mrs T had to put up with many traitors.
1339635474068082688 2020-12-18 02:16:00 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @imminentcullaps @mattwridley It is not as if human genes are perfect &amp; not to be messed with - we are all carrying huge numbers of faulty genes as inbreeding reveals &amp; natural selection is struggling to remove them. Until recently, many died from rotten teeth &amp; problematic childbirth - v poor designs.
1339633801358667783 2020-12-18 02:09:22 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @mattwridley @goddersbloom There is much validity in vaccines, but the cause of all the current suspicion is that we know the gov is lying at a high rate for the Great Reset &amp; is faking the death figures. Even with a lying rate of 95%, 5% of what they say can still be true, if perhaps still exaggerated.
1339627877717975045 2020-12-18 01:45:49 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom I know an elderly lady whose cousin had Covid, recovered then after recovering had two falls and later died, aged in her 80s. Cause of death was put down as Covid.
1339615768963649537 2020-12-18 00:57:42 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @The_Ayatollah_ This suggests they are few in no. but very committed. These types have always been within all white populations (although pre-diversity their hatred showed in different ways), but in a modern wealthy society they tend to concentrate where they can cause most harm - MSM, politics.

The black ppl all support their own countries.
1339581049752285186 2020-12-17 22:39:45 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> People will just have to start voting differently &amp; stop voting LibLabCon, but for that to happen we will have to wait until the penny finally drops that LibLabCon are not on our side.

1339577894427709441 2020-12-17 22:27:12 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @henrywesto @Deckardswench And the Tory voters will once again vote for more of this white replacement at the next GE 'To stop Labour getting in' as they say.  ... and to think that these foolish voters could have put at least 50 UKIP in parliament by now under G Batten.
1339513360673595392 2020-12-17 18:10:46 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> In govt job applications does it specify 'must read the Guardian, approve of the BBC, and be a 5th columnist who hates his country. Normal ppl need not apply'

This will never end until we do something about the enemy within. The only way to lessen their influence is to compel Freeview to allow some new TV channels, ones that are not controlled by the left.
1339132111358488579 2020-12-16 16:55:49 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @EternalEnglish I have heard 3rd gen children refer to Pakistan etc as 'My country'.Living amongst us makes them MORE loyal to their country of origin. They love their 'homelands' as they call them &amp; would readily return there if bribed. We paid them to come&amp; they would willingly go back if paid

The rest will find out one day that they should have paid more attention.

1338898647384285186 2020-12-16 01:28:07 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @LBilderberg Part of the reason the NHS 'cannot cope' with a minor increase in bed demand (normal anyway for this time of year)  is their current 30-40% absenteeism on full pay.
1338897429240950784 2020-12-16 01:23:17 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @WotATyme The govt &amp; NHS should feel guilty (as if they could) about turning the sick away from hospital &amp; drs to die. And dentists even - were told at one point they cannot help those in excruciating pain even, &amp; now gov forces dentists to take much longer ('decontamination' procedures)

They wanted to help the communists back then, and they still do, although they do not use that word.
1338772715264684032 2020-12-15 17:07:43 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> This is an interesting thread about how Hollywood set out to corrupt the US. Twitter etc will not approve, and the time will come when we are no longer allowed to read this sort of material.

1338767923410821120 2020-12-15 16:48:40 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @cursedsalad Meanwhile, Js in the US do their utmost to weaken and bring down the hand that feeds them and protects them. It seems that 'our greatest ally' works only one way.
1338766879230480384 2020-12-15 16:44:31 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> The authorities arrest the RIght for 'mean words' so they can balance the books and say half the terrorism is from the Right and half from the Left &amp; Islam. It means they equate a racist tweet with actually blowing something up. Manipulation of the figures - as with Covid data
1338764776063774721 2020-12-15 16:36:10 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @cursedsalad I think what we learn here is that the bl ppl are onto something valid when they demand separate spaces for themselves - big spaces are called 'countries', eg Liberia.
1338764135484575745 2020-12-15 16:33:37 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Bad people like bad people, and want them to have more power and more rights.

I do not think they 'embraced diversity'.

They have had a 9 mth skive on full pay AND reduced the queues by letting the cancer patients die off.
1338504728708341760 2020-12-14 23:22:50 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @False_Pos1t1ve The left instinctively know what is bad for w ppl and support any policy that is so without any script. They approve of any policy that gives the state more power &amp; control over us, as they know that the left is in charge of the state.
1338503703775555585 2020-12-14 23:18:45 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @riseupmelbourne @dss66 The way they present the Covid deaths implies that without Covid they would still be alive. As you say, without usual annual deaths to compare, the figures are meaningless. Every yr there is a Foundations Level Maths Q to spot a data interpretation error at this basic level.
1338501097330266113 2020-12-14 23:08:24 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @nastymutant 'Were we asked' - to be fair, there have always been some anti-immign parties to vote for, but  voters shunned them, on the advice of MSM. All the misery is self inflicted. Eg May was open border as Hom Sec &amp; PM, even danced with bl leaders, &amp; STILL they voted for her &amp; not UKIP
1338500126927630339 2020-12-14 23:04:33 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @DianewasHR ... and if not this year, they will bring in the restrictions next year for the next 'pandemic'. This year they will keep the lockdown on for as long as they think that they and the MSM can get away with their deception &amp; distortion of the figures.

1338456498901487621 2020-12-14 20:11:11 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> NHS lying again so it does not need to bother working over Christmas, to extend the 6mth skive
1338456079919968261 2020-12-14 20:09:31 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Surely when the lies of the MSM &amp; govt  reach a certain magnitude they will collapse? This scale of lying was not pos.10 yrs ago as you need the MSM to be ALL on-side, back &amp;  then the MSM were not all singing from same hymn sheet. However, DM might still expose the lies.
1338429606597177344 2020-12-14 18:24:19 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Jack_H2o Yes, good point and encouraging. Things can change quickly when a critical number have had enough. Changes might come at any time now that we have reached the stage where decline is suddenly accelerating, especially re the NHS. Furlough bribes cannot continue indefinitely.
1338425550772252672 2020-12-14 18:08:12 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @C0vid0 @CllrBSilvester @jenninemorgan @AllysonPollock @simondolan @JamesDelingpole @allisonpearson I read that NHS absenteeism levels are even higher than teachers' levels &amp; in the region of 30-40%. Not much mention of this in the 'free press' - so maybe the govt could give us the stats.
1338424234809438208 2020-12-14 18:02:58 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> The corrupt believe that if enough of them are in on it that nothing will ever happen to them, so safety in numbers, and because they have the powerful on-side in the legal profession &amp; the MSM. USSR never managed to shake off their corrupt elite from the communist era.
1338422198286036992 2020-12-14 17:54:53 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> The sad thing is, we were never invaded by an army that was stronger &amp; forced us to submit, no, we were the STRONG who INVITED the WEAK over to conquer us. 'We' as in 'we' kept voting for MPs with clear track record of wanting open borders (T May, Boris &amp; his 3m Chinese/Hkong)
1338419084120219650 2020-12-14 17:42:30 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @AustraliaWake @TerryStorey4 If this man got a Nobel Peace prize then we should posthumously award them to Idi Amin &amp; Robert Mugabe - well, actually the British govt did knight Mugabe (true, not a joke, later withdrawn) to show whose side they are on - not ours.
1338418446489489408 2020-12-14 17:39:58 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @chicchan @LBilderberg If a particular patient does die &amp; the cause is not really known or investigated even,  it seems very little evidence is needed in order to put a tick in the govt's 'death by Covid' list, but very, very hard - impossible even - to put a tick in the 'death by vaccine' box.

1338217243545657346 2020-12-14 04:20:28 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> There is a war going on but most ppl do not realise as the changes are gradual &amp; the people think at each stage that it won't be too bad or change too much as long as they are not racist &amp; just submit to the agenda. They have no idea that things can suddenly move very fast.

It is jobs for the connected, &amp; well-paid ones (£2000/week for a secretary working in Foreign Aid several yrs ago). I wonder if some of these £150,000 bosses of these charities would give 50p to a person in genuine need?

1338196482143424523 2020-12-14 02:57:58 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Some of the private sector are getting furlough money, others are not - it is sort of random due to 'criteria' and not real need, but they are bribing sufficient numbers to stop a general unrest while they 'train us' to submit. Obviously unsustainable longterm. Massive inflation.

The wooden ones were more hygienic as the surface is gradually worn away when it is scrubbed clean. The plastic ones retain the bacteria.

We should be sceptical of any message the MSM pushes - these are the same ppl who push for us to share our land &amp; wealth with 3rd world &amp; become diverse, &amp; they also push the EU &amp; the ROP.
1338182710779637771 2020-12-14 02:03:15 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @SusanHarris80 @StevePersonally Boer War, &amp; WWI once considered glorious causes, &amp; no longer are, as time has elapsed. WWII will also be seen as a huge disaster one day. Look at the outcome of WWII - all Western nations now multiracial, pro-whites vilified as the Germans were, &amp;communism taught in school &amp; uni
1338167194027499522 2020-12-14 01:01:35 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @SusanHarris80 @StevePersonally Govt has to think of reasons - this is part of War propaganda. If the War really was 'for Poland' then why did we abandon them to Stalin after the War? You do not decimate your country 'to help Poland'. Gov propaganda still going strong eg 50p coin says 'Diversity Built Britain'
1338159609585004544 2020-12-14 00:31:27 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom So you save, then govt takes some of it by money inflation. This is why there is a surge to buy gold/land/property. The last two can still be taxed.  This is why in corrupt places like India they convert their money to gold, &amp; we are going the same way.
1338155929041309702 2020-12-14 00:16:49 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @GerardBattenUK Gov will not give him a council house or hotel room -  meanwhile, two local hotels are now fully occupied by a certain category of 'the homeless' (immig) that this white man does not fall into. And they even have security provided for them on the door! £ is no object, sometimes.

1338129715383693313 2020-12-13 22:32:40 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @StevePersonally Who declared war on whom? Mosley tried to stop the madness. We went to War to help communist Soviet Union and Stalin. Nothing to be proud of - we killed off our best men, created a generation of widows &amp; single women, &amp; bankrupted the nation - we even gave USSR 5000 tanks!

I told them &amp; if I remember correctly they left it in.

Many who are ignorant themselves must be aware of this but still make no effort to look up the rules.

The same with our statues &amp; heritage.

L Fox seems best option. Farage is popular but remember he helped msm to kill Batten's UKIP

1337801011788976129 2020-12-13 00:46:31 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @GerardBattenUK It might awaken the rich now it is reaching them too in their retreats. If they had helped before now, UKIP could have fought the last GE with millions more.

1337797064231677952 2020-12-13 00:30:49 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @KenViatex @Steve1Sandwich A scandalous situation for a country that can spend 300 billion on Covid and at the same time abandon the sick. Strange how chemists can see us but doctors cannot.
1337489927567761409 2020-12-12 04:10:22 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> If we had a proper set of MPs, they would make sure something was done about these badly run organisations. But we only have a small minority of decent MPs, so nothing is ever done.   The authorities have HUGE funds but cannot even fill potholes or sweep streets clean.

If the gov needs the vaccine to be seen to work, all they will do is stop over-recording Covid cases

1337479232138698757 2020-12-12 03:27:52 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @The_Ayatollah_ If you look at DM comments under their articles, there is now a significant number of commenters who make comments along the line of 'it's payback time'.

1337058047546548230 2020-12-10 23:34:14 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom WWI now seen in a different light to close a the time, and the same will happen to WWII after a similar period elapses.
1337057311614005257 2020-12-10 23:31:19 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom And even Churchill said: 'We killed the wrong pig' in the aftermath. Perhaps better as a soldier than a politician, although even as as soldier he was too willing to sacrifice his men (and, to be fair, willing to put himself in danger also as  a young man charging on horseback)
1337056153117876227 2020-12-10 23:26:42 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom For many/most of the public sector their life has got more skivey (Whilst recognising that a minority on the front line are not skivey - the lower ranks). Overhear in hospital: "She will get the 1st 6mths off on full pay then 1/2 pay for the next 6mths"

Basically, 25% of the white indigenous hate their own country, heritage &amp; ppl, &amp; this minority is leading us off the cliff edge.

1337019279116480512 2020-12-10 21:00:11 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> No attempt to be fair and unbiased. The only reason they get away with it is because most of our MPs are also against us.
1337018653875834880 2020-12-10 20:57:42 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> When Japan is negotiating some sort of deal, or Russia or Somalia, I doubt that about half of their negotiating team hate their own country and want the worst possible deal for their own country.
1336964709078200323 2020-12-10 17:23:20 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> This sums up what is wrong with Britain - too many of this type in high positions, including in the MSM

1336963077405806592 2020-12-10 17:16:51 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Instead of sending a few quid to Batten's UKIP or similar, the wealthy thought they could use their £ to just live away from the diversity. Now it has reached them too may be they will finally start to oppose the treachery of LibLabCon. Not voting CON would be a start.
1336791570268479493 2020-12-10 05:55:21 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @GerardBattenUK Even if the Pfizer V kills ppl, it will be put down to Covid. However, a deliberately harmful one would require too many in on the secret for it to be kept quiet. Perhaps the only conspiracy is that each yr a new V will come out with ever increasing control &amp; monitoring.
1336669842011803654 2020-12-09 21:51:39 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> True, the gov just invents whatever fake-science it wants to for its agenda, with the MSM in full collusion &amp; shielding the govt's fake science from proper scrutiny - but I was hoping the vaccine might make this harder for them to pull off as vaccinted ppl assume they are immune.
1336565940880879617 2020-12-09 14:58:47 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @London19721 I doubt Lab could have done more damage. Con get away with more damage than Lab because for some reason I cannot understand, most ppl still think they are conservative. This is clear from Twitter comments, ppl STILL saying 'I vote Con to keep Lab out'

1336565020205920258 2020-12-09 14:55:07 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @simondolan 'fears' is not the same as 'evidence' but even if they had 'evidence' we have to remember that stats are very malleable in the gov's hands.
1336564672661770241 2020-12-09 14:53:44 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom At least it stops ppl saying 'I vote Tory as they are better than Lab' as this yr proves this is not the case  Doubt the War was really a fight for freedom though, more like a fight for the interests &amp; expansion of the Soviet Union. Even Churchill said 'we killed the wrong pig'.

Also, imagine the queues in some streets for the charger. BUT, gov prefers smart metres as enables energy rationing, but 'important ppl' like Shapps get more

They can only lead us off cliff if we let them.

They can fake the stats to fall in line with whatever they do, as the stats are totally malleable in their hands
1336340017501728769 2020-12-09 00:01:02 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @StephenRego4 @BrexitFutureUK So the Germans are violating the EU rules that I just posted. They are not allowed to ban it if European standards permit it. The last quote was an EU statement.
1336339678107107335 2020-12-08 23:59:41 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @StephenRego4 @BrexitFutureUK “Fire safety rules&amp; building material standards are a matter for national authorities. The EU's only role is in making sure materials which meet those national standards are not excluded from national markets in a discriminatory way just because they are made elsewhere in Europe"

1336312023580291072 2020-12-08 22:09:48 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @StephenRego4 @BrexitFutureUK We all know why report does not mention EU - everything is political. EU supervises standards for Europe &amp; often trumpets this claim. Fact remains cladding passed all EU regs but not US ones,&amp; avoid blame by claiming they are 'European' standards this time, not 'EU' (lawyerspeak)
1336293476607139847 2020-12-08 20:56:06 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @StephenRego4 @BrexitFutureUK Not interested in your personal insults - just interested if you can argue your point &amp; in my opinion you have not done so. Cladding passed all EU regs, but not US ones, &amp; they get out of it saying the cladding passed 'European' standards not 'EU' ones.

Eg when Mugabe backed by China was attacking S.Rhodesia in 70s, the MSM news was just as biased against the whites back then, just that back then, not all newspapers were submitting to the anti-white agenda &amp; they gave the other side (TV did not)

When billions are involved and the gov reputation is at stake, and when they have the MSM on side in this, we will find the unwanted statistics can easily be dealt with.

Only then will the virus be 'conquered' and the govt will let us take our masks off &amp; take away the security at hospitals to stop us going in without prior permission.
1334855546659344386 2020-12-04 21:42:17 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @YorkshireHollz @BorisJohnson I suspect many doctors will sign their own forms to say they have had the vaccine.
1334855327850885120 2020-12-04 21:41:25 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @LockdownLazarus The govt uses fakestats that suits their agenda to prove whatver they want. In the end they want us ALL monitored &amp; contolled The ppl are easy to fool as the MSM is in collusion with the govt on this one and covers for them when they issue fakestats
1334850223357747200 2020-12-04 21:21:08 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @ABD_Sussex @goddersbloom The countries going off the cliff edge are ones where the politicians are traitors and hate their own ppl &amp; want to bring them down. Look at the way 50 MPs signed the letter to not deport criminals - we can clearly see the politicians are NOT on our side. Voters are v foolish.
1334849006661488645 2020-12-04 21:16:18 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom We would like to lead other nations into the quicksand to suffocate and die as we plan to. Some nations will follow us, but others will prefer to thrive rather than sink.

If the council really was green it would make it easy to dispose of batteries instead of having to take a trip to the official tip. Even at the tip they would not let me take a thrown-away computer 'that is the council's property'
1334847140670136320 2020-12-04 21:08:53 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom The banks &amp; big business will eagerly lap up any govt bribes going and will gladly pretend the govt is being wise if the bribe is large enough, and this is how the elite continue to destroy the nation.
1334846201959747585 2020-12-04 21:05:09 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @ShellenbergerMD @goddersbloom More examples of how the govt can get away with fakestats when the MSM is in collusion on an issue and covers for them. There is no MSM to expose the frauds. This is why the  rate of self-destruction in the West is increasing.
1334845703894556673 2020-12-04 21:03:10 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom You have to wonder why the govt wants to go elect when it involves digging up every rd &amp; when many will not have convenient access to chargers even then (Qs and arguments). They could go for H2 with no disruption, but then they could not monitor/control our usage 'to save planet'
1334844948076695556 2020-12-04 21:00:10 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom With elec, the gov can ration our use via smart meters &amp; also by our having 'permitted allocations' when using other charging points with our cards, so country's overall usage can be controlled and lowered as req.  VIPs (eg anti-car councillors) will get a greater allowance.

They had no time for any of the above - but they had enough time for the following item: "If you bought an Arcadia gift card, you can only let you spend 1/2 its value due to company going bankrupt"  Why do ppl not even notice upside down MSM priorities?
1334561906099621896 2020-12-04 02:15:28 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Sozzinski They will see how far they can go vaccinating us, and next year push it a bit further for some 'new threat'.  The govt can just generate more Covid deaths (fake stats) if needed, or they can just test fewer &amp; generate fewer Covid deaths if they want to claim the vaccine worked.

H&amp;Safety means you have official approval, it does not mean it is safe. It was not approved in the US by their standards. Sometimes approval is about who you know.

1334408252117946376 2020-12-03 16:04:54 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Politicians in the Con Party always reach that point in their career where they are made an offer they cannot refuse - either get on board or your career ends now.

One reason for intense monitoring is to keep lid on the soldiers of Islm that Boris &amp; Priti are bringing in by the boatload, as if the soldiers kick off too soon,ppl would demand immign is reduced
1334406674426302464 2020-12-03 15:58:37 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Many ppl seem to imagine the NHS is free and are grateful when they do their job at 10% efficiency level. We are being vastly overcharged for a service that is abysmal and that is being generous.
1334405724986871809 2020-12-03 15:54:51 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom I suspect the top priority of the civil sevice/MI5/M16 whatever, is to gather 'info' on all politicians, especially photographs of 'something embarrassing', but even something low level can be blown out of proportion eg someone taking your speeding fine.

1333823869879279619 2020-12-02 01:22:46 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @cursedsalad The Smithsonian Institute are responsible for it being illegal to check (eg DNA test) if any ancient remains found in the US are from white people - they MUST be handed over to 'Native Amercians' for disposal. All started by the Jew Boas. See Richard Dewhurst 'Giants Ruled.' book
1333776178839232512 2020-12-01 22:13:16 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Bad people are running the country right now - the voters have been very foolish over the decades by letting the MSM persuade them to do this.
1333775617964318721 2020-12-01 22:11:02 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> T Robinson, for protecting his child from a pedo, gets harsher punishment than 95% of the child rapists do who operate in grooming gangs, and who drug and rape vulnerable teenage girls.
1333769854768263170 2020-12-01 21:48:08 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @pritipatel Pritti &amp; Boris will continue to welcome the soldiers of Islm by the boatload every day &amp; bus them to hotels, whilst pretending they are doing something about mass immign. Will the voters be fooled yet again at the next GE and still vote for the treacherous Tories?
1333768636985651201 2020-12-01 21:43:17 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> In other words, despite knowing what most of us want, you do the opposite - you continue to keep the border WIDE OPEN, and change the rules slightly, which we know will not be applied anyway, especially to the soldiers of Islm arriving by boat daily (&amp; being picked up)
1333767221856890880 2020-12-01 21:37:40 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @ElfieGoldbergi1 The BBC should put its principles of bl culture worship into practice by employing someone like her as a newsreader.
1333733876250894339 2020-12-01 19:25:10 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @EdB61 @MartinKnight_ @Mich1971C I think the GPs get £12 per jab, so suddenly all the reasons the staff 'could not possibly see us' suddenly vanish. But after the jab, the GP doors will close again.
1333712606507491328 2020-12-01 18:00:39 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @LncsPchr @RGoldblatzberg The real reason the gov loves the jab is that they can get us one step closer to total monitoring. This is also why they want cashless society to a) monitor us b) to turn off our money if we rebel. Also, elec cars- easier to ration electricity than alternatives like hydrogen fuel
1333710120862314496 2020-12-01 17:50:46 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @jollyheretic @RGoldblatzberg I wonder why no loved ones were at the bedside of the dying patient? Could it be the overreaction to Covid? Does this nurse support the overreaction that led to this lonely death? And how many non-Covid are put in Covid wards? (policy in some hospitls before test res. comes back)
1333708788034056193 2020-12-01 17:45:28 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @McBricko @RGoldblatzberg ...as she will discover one day for herself if, when the child is grown up, she does not identify with the mother.
1333702290746781703 2020-12-01 17:19:39 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @YardleyShooting Meanwhile, Britain still sends foreign aid to China. We are so corrupt.  Once day the Russians will realise it is better to befriend fellow whites than the Chinese.
1333702051688292352 2020-12-01 17:18:42 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @21WIRE For some reason the most ruthless and nasty tend to get to the top in today's business world in the businesses that handle billions. They have the genes of the left, including no conscience and hatred of whites.
1333701283031769089 2020-12-01 17:15:39 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @MartinKnight_ @Mich1971C They will never give up their new way of non-working. That is why they keep quiet about the empty hospitals &amp; why they make a huge fuss about the importance of masks etc to prolong the Big Skive. All the thousands dying through lack of tmt does not seem to bother most of them.
1333699994239578113 2020-12-01 17:10:32 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Lordgreyofponty The later stages of the current cold civil war are that the ppl will lose their money as the economy crashes. Only then will ppl start to waken up, and by then the situation might be 'terrible'. But, if enough of us are determined, even then, all nonsense can be reversed
1333697801247727616 2020-12-01 17:01:49 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @glasthomebury ps try the Jon Gaunt diet - he was fat, now is thin.
1333697543029600256 2020-12-01 17:00:47 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> I suppose we should just be thankful that they did not attempt to have him killed in prison like last time. For protecting his children from pedos, he got a bigger punishment than most groomer gang members get for raping and drugging vulnerable teenage girls.
1333696111626907650 2020-12-01 16:55:06 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> If they recorded everyone who drank tea in the 28 days before death as a 'tea death', then we would find that the most common cause of death in this country is tea.  How govt &amp;TV twist the figs would make a good Q in FoundnMathsGCSE,as they always have a data misinterpretation Q
1333694702655254529 2020-12-01 16:49:30 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @LizKershawDJ @NicolaSturgeon The Scots bite the hand that feeds them - England. In response, England gets on the floor in submission and throws more money at them.
1333694382835445760 2020-12-01 16:48:14 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @ElfieGoldbergi1 This man is just a more extreme manifestation of standard Leftist thinking. Most lefties, just as he does, hate their own race for being superior. This is what defines the left - a hatred of the superior. This is why they have even made the word itself a derogatory term.
1333693020764561409 2020-12-01 16:42:49 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom We are in chains because we voted to be so. It was a case of the STRONG inviting over the WEAK to conquer them.  Basically, democracy does not work if the people vote for enemy-within politicians after listening to the enemy-within MSM.
1333660355017510913 2020-12-01 14:33:01 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Richard93421518 @moggy67 @julieAn34464628 When you say 'so shut it' this pretty much sums up the attitude of the NHS to the patients: shut up, go away
1333659931342467078 2020-12-01 14:31:20 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Richard93421518 @moggy67 @julieAn34464628 If the system works, how is it that it takes 2 wks+ to see a dr even before Covid? Are you saying there is no financial penalty if a GP surgery calls an ambulance? Is it false that they are going to get about £12 per vaccine?Are there no penalties for missing vaccination targets?
1333477786061844480 2020-12-01 02:27:33 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @privvv_colee It is incredible that 29% of your followers would vote for traitor Boris and his open door immigration policy and his green energy suicide policy, and for his politicised and BLM-friendly police force. You will only stop &amp; think when your house prices collapse as the economy does
1333477046492798983 2020-12-01 02:24:37 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @privvv_colee It is because of ple thinking like you do that we now have traitor-Boris &amp; traitor-Priti welcoming the soldiers of Islam by the boatload whilst they also crash the economy. We could now have 50+ UKIP MPs under Batten in parlmnt. You  chose one lot of traitors instead of another.
1333475133550419971 2020-12-01 02:17:01 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @markbtelevision We find that the MSM are more interested in a road traffic accident in Britain from about 2 years ago involving an American diplomat's wife, and the never ending Stephen Lawrence case.
1333473821257568266 2020-12-01 02:11:48 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> One day they will regret turning against us and siding with the enemy-within govt, if the ppl ever come to their senses
1333473312639422464 2020-12-01 02:09:47 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @ThisIsREngland A lot of the hatred is jealousy as we had the biggest, most successful empire &amp; - what they hate most - our language is now the world language. Everyone hates the superior, basically, &amp; it makes our own Left hate us also. They are still trying to eliminate 'Imperial' measurements
1333472219922657284 2020-12-01 02:05:26 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @emmakennytv Gambling is big business = lots of £££ = they have lots of influence with the regulators due to lobbying - a bit like Google &amp; Amazon etc do
1333416744724082688 2020-11-30 22:25:00 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Buyaflag @RubyTho93126265 @Bluebir06347604 A neighbour who was forced to give up bingo due to Covid, and now she has about £1500 saved up! Before Covid she used to keep borrowing a tenner from me for food!
1333415859667275776 2020-11-30 22:21:29 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Good points - figures out of context are meaningless, eg omission of last yr's deaths including flu/cold virus deaths. This basic (deliberate) error is at the level of Foundation Maths GCSE, as every year they have a 'spot the flaw' Question in data interpretation.
1333379769312956424 2020-11-30 19:58:04 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> - then going out to look for Tommy Robinson and anyone else who annoys Boris &amp; Priti's soldiers of Islm arriving daily &amp; being put in hotels, then allocated housing ahead of veterans.
1333378791062822913 2020-11-30 19:54:11 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> These scientists are appointed in the first place by their politics and not their ability.
1333378566764027910 2020-11-30 19:53:17 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> The only 'solution' is for us all to be chipped &amp; to go cashless so the govt can monitor everyone all the time - chip readers will be in the streets. And electric cars will help too as elec. can be rationed with smart meters more easily than H2 made from water (using any energy).
1333377263480475648 2020-11-30 19:48:07 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @BySpoke I suspect it was partly a bribe to get the private hospitals to close down other treatments, as otherwise if private carried on with gastroscopies etc it would show the NHS up, as ppl would see private carrying on while NHS abandoned their posts
1333367728598560768 2020-11-30 19:10:13 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Sprinter0712 The govt now wants you to die so they can save money on your pension and any NHS treatment you need, and they will achieve this by pretending the Covid virus means they cannot give you medical care. You have paid into NHS, but now you will have to pay private on top.
1333366849095036928 2020-11-30 19:06:44 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @andrejpwalker If just 5-10% more ppl could wake up and see the MSM bias and agenda, then the momentum could build up to eventually stop all the nonsense. The ppl might finally wake up when it eventually affects that which is most dear to their hearts - their house value &amp; bank balance.
1333365933704949762 2020-11-30 19:03:05 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @RobsBottin80 @wilkiegog 'Career or country, which shall I choose?.... Hmm'  - Most MPs chose career.
1333365246338211840 2020-11-30 19:00:22 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Correct about the small groups - Twitter tries to keep us in small circles of the like-minded to stop non-MSM viewpoints  from reaching those who rely on MSM for their news. A good site for reaching different ppl is politicians' Twitter accounts
1333351754453356547 2020-11-30 18:06:45 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @BrettEverest @whosthedaddyiam Normally this warrants 1 hour community service in the worst possible scenario, but in his case our 'justice' system will prob see fit to show once again that they are not on the side of god people, and are part of the enemy-within.
1333350640702066689 2020-11-30 18:02:19 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @righttospeak3 @Jon_statistics we are kneee deep in it already
1333349434793594880 2020-11-30 17:57:32 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @PaulmichaelODo1 @righttospeak3 @Jon_statistics Correct - charities are just a way to channel our taxes to left-wing activists, with a large cut also going into the bank balances and £million houses in London for the connected
1333348818348363776 2020-11-30 17:55:05 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @PoveyLarry @Jon_statistics And this, in a nutshell, explains the entire demise of the West, as the enemy-within have taken over the MSM.
1333348566518128641 2020-11-30 17:54:05 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Jon_statistics Look up past Foundation Maths GCSE (the easy one) and see each year there is a Q where you have to spot the data interpretation error. Govt's deliberate data twisting is the level of this Q, eg 'X deaths today' means nothing out of context, such as total deaths, deaths last yr
1333347572254203905 2020-11-30 17:50:08 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @BorisJohnson @TaylorOBE Boris - will you possibly mention the murder of Kriss Donald, or is Kriss the wrong colour? How many murders have been committed so far by the soldiers of Islm that you and Priti invited in?
1333346636358152198 2020-11-30 17:46:25 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @ChrisLeahey1 @moggy67 @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump For the missing ballots to fit in Biden's basement, his basement must go down half a mile, therefore it is more likely to be a pile of $1000 backhanders from China
1333346060555743241 2020-11-30 17:44:07 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @NickGriffinBU Let those who are keen &amp; trust the govt - such as MPs - let them test it out first for the rest of us. In fact some genuinely vulnerable eg poor immune system (who could die from any virus) might get a false sense of immunity from the vaccine &amp; mix &amp; mingle more than they should
1333107539735703555 2020-11-30 01:56:20 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom The only way to get death from Covid and other viruses to zero, as the govt aims to do, is to banish the state of being towards the end of your natural life. As this is not possible, lockdowns will never end.
1333105947502374915 2020-11-30 01:50:00 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom Re children dying from Covid - A child is probably more likely to die from a terrst. attack by one of the foreign soldiers of Islm that Priti &amp; Boris invited into the country than from Covid.
1333084113377652737 2020-11-30 00:23:14 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @hellomarkhere @ZubyMusic Correct, the govt data misinterpretation is at the level of a question they have every year in Maths GCSE Foundation Level (the easy one) about 'what is wrong with this...' then they give errors to spot. Eg. 'X deaths today' is meaningless out of context, eg what was last yrs'?
1333082985306984453 2020-11-30 00:18:45 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @StevePopescu @ZubyMusic Good post. It is surprising how many just love the idea of grassing and informing on each other. They are getting a little taste of communism and are loving it.
1333082710353604611 2020-11-30 00:17:40 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @PeacefulRioterr @ZubyMusic Well put - I used to think if only people knew what the govt was doing (eg mass immign) they would start to vote against it, but this is not the case. Even those in white areas can see primary schools on TV with no white faces, and yet they still do not see a problem &amp; vote same
1333081685919993864 2020-11-30 00:13:36 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @gaming_jacker @ZubyMusic The only hope is that the ppl will start to think differently when we enter the next phase - a complete collapse in their own personal safety (crime) and a collapse in the economy. This could wake a few more up.
1333080804172455937 2020-11-30 00:10:05 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Kewper2 @ZubyMusic Correct, the downfall of the West is due mainly to the TV, as the left gravitated to this media &amp; now they totally dominate it. The truth is still out there, but most are so stupid that they think it is not important and do not bother to look.
1333079317169967111 2020-11-30 00:04:11 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Alleninvest @ZubyMusic The majority of the ppl will only start to pay attention when it affects their house value &amp; money.
1333079054719791120 2020-11-30 00:03:08 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Ants81748625 @ZubyMusic Especially the ones who will vote Tory at the next GE despite the Tories having completely the opposite views to their own. All the Tories have to do is make the odd false soundbite at the next GE about 'reducing immign' (the same lie, again) &amp; the ppl will fall for it again.
1333078081364488193 2020-11-29 23:59:16 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @ZubyMusic How many rich and powerful business leaders are quite prepared to destroy/damage their own businesses with wokeness &amp; mixed race adverts &amp; lockdowns, showing that they put their politics first above their own company's success &amp; their own wealth if it helps to take us ro '1984'
1333076372701507586 2020-11-29 23:52:29 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Iromg @puffnblow_at_GP @metpoliceuk @pritipatel It might be an own goal - the police double standards here, with batons and aggression and fines here and kneeling when it comes to BLM. Just look at the negative PR generated for the treacherous Tories.  Shame on the DA (again) for refusing to allow comments on this story.
1333030853069430786 2020-11-29 20:51:36 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @MummySmiler Most people have very little ability to see what is going on and still trust Piers Morgan, DM, etc and do not even think there is an agenda. The ppl are so easy to fool now the MSM is almost 100% on-message.
1333030291884044288 2020-11-29 20:49:22 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @rob_miller12345 @wilkiegog ... and the strangest thing of all is that the DM will again tell their readers to shun any new parties (like they did with Batten's UKIP last GE) and the ppl will vote again for the Tories.
1333029986597539841 2020-11-29 20:48:09 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @ThisIsREngland And by then we will all be chipped, and it will be a cashless society so they can turn off your money if you rebel. And yet most cannot see this &amp; are just too focused on their house value to notice or care. Most still think you are a conspiracy theorist for even mentioning it.
1333029362589966337 2020-11-29 20:45:41 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @ChloP120611 @wilkiegog I hope we do not just forgive and forget (and re-employ in top jobs again) like they did in Russia after getting rid of communist rule.
1333029022918455296 2020-11-29 20:44:20 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @JohnKarter01 @wilkiegog Wait until they get us all chipped with the vaccine,they will know where you are at all times &amp; can turn off your bank cards if you displease them. This will be even more effective when we go cashless. A 1984 dream for many(=a  substantial majority &amp;who now run the civil service)
1333028192433659905 2020-11-29 20:41:02 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @1ThessCh5 They prefer appeasement. They will think differently when it affects what is most dear to their hearts - not their country or race or heritage -  their house value and bank balance
1333027824836423680 2020-11-29 20:39:34 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @darrengrimes_ @wilkiegog Most ppl will only start to pay attention when it affects that which is most dear to their hearts. Not their ppl or culture or heritage or children's future, no, none of these... it is THEIR HOUSE VALUE! and their bank balance and pension and shares value. Time will come...
1333027046717607940 2020-11-29 20:36:29 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @JeremyBennett @RichHoblyn @wilkiegog Jeremy - you are assuming CO2 is a pollutant. In fact it helps vegetation to grow. But it is hard to have an informed opinion as real debate is banned in the MSM - from David Bellamy onwards (banned from TV for doubting). We only get extremists' fakescience allowed on TV
1332799181816279046 2020-11-29 05:31:01 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @vivandviews @MetPoliceEvents In the MSM news on Classic FM they referred to 'smoke bombs &amp; bottles thrown' (poss. by undercover police) In other words, negative coverage. Meanwhile MSM described BLM riot in which 30 officers injured as 'mostly peaceful'  The MSM, govt &amp; police are NOT on our side!
1332715287645458433 2020-11-28 23:57:39 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @TheTashmichael @DarrenSelkus Unless you said you had accidentally called the burglar a racist name, then the police would come.
1332702948544180224 2020-11-28 23:08:38 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @EternalEnglish I wonder if this bl woman became a barrister: (a) by overcoming white privilege and working extra hard or (b) by getting an advantage in job promotion due to her colour, also called positive discrimination.  I know for certain the police entrance exam is easier for bl ppl.
1332701568639098883 2020-11-28 23:03:09 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @JOHjohJOH12 @wilkiegog @BorisJohnson They Tories not care as they know these types will still vote for them on the basis that the Tories stamp on their heads less hard than Lab would.

1332700224763154433 2020-11-28 22:57:48 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom They would never let David Starkey present another history programme, now that they know his views. He would get v. high ratings, as he did previously on his low-budget programmes.
1332699698155704325 2020-11-28 22:55:43 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @RichHoblyn @wilkiegog Maybe the reason they want us to go electric &amp; not for hydrogen which is far more practical &amp; cheap, is that with electric in conjunction with SmartMeters, they can easily ration and monitor our usage - with hydrogen you can buy as much as you want. Also, electric=queues H2=none

This is priority, not health of patients.  NHS is run for the benefit of the staff not the patients. They are shortening the Queues by letting the ill die.

Perhaps whites will get one last chance in 4 yrs to correct this?
1332618016404754432 2020-11-28 17:31:08 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @NickGriffinBU The white voters KNEW the Dems would open the gates, yet over 1/3 of the whites still voted Dem (I think?). Therefore the US will sink because 1/3 of whites voted for self-destruction. Therefore white demise is self-inflicted as over 1/2 have been voting like this for decades

1332391581354250240 2020-11-28 02:31:22 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Took a lot of dragging &amp; screaming (&amp; the Soviet Union - releasing WWII files) to get the figure down to 4million (&amp; more to go) but 6--&gt;4 is just such bad PR that they simply ignore the official correction &amp; just use the old figure, &amp; anyone who does not do so is 'antisemitic'
1332376591255670788 2020-11-28 01:31:48 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Doctors &amp; NHS cannot wangle a 6 month semi-holiday on full pay off the back of ordinary flu. Just ring up work, cough, and get another 2 weeks off! Good job the shop keepers are not as vulnerable to Covid as the NHS are or we would have no food.

I suppose it is easier to arrest ordinary people and enjoy watching them squirm and worry than it is to arrest druggies and burglars who do not really care about being arrested.

1332369711238098945 2020-11-28 01:04:28 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Good point - if the MPs put 1/100 effort into closing the border as they do into supporting foreign aid &amp; the rights of the Windrush immigrants, there would be no boats coming in via the Channel.

Or, at least, according those who get the research grants &amp; jobs in academia. They also believe that young women are just as likely to want to drive skip lorries as men are, and will point to each others 'Research' Papers to prove it.

1331544269409177600 2020-11-25 18:24:27 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Lefty scientists live off the reputation of the genuine ones. The lefty ones tell us the only reason more young women do not drive skip lorries is because of society's prejudices. They cannot really believe this but they readily abandon truth to push any woke narrative.

1331533919313948676 2020-11-25 17:43:19 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> They want us all to communicate on social media so they can monitor us and find out who is not on board with the agenda.

I do not vote Con, not even in local council elections any more.

If they really were concerned for us, GPs would see us eg on the other side of a screen even. Hospitals cancelling cancer treatments shows NHS has zero concern

1330753694049112065 2020-11-23 14:02:59 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @MoodyBlues85 @wilkiegog The interaction in pubs is far too free and ideas are being exchanged away from the monitoring of the govt. Interaction on social media is easier to monitor, and this will get more intense if ppl carry on voting as they always do for the enemy-within to be their rulers.

Easy to see even for those who watch msmTV.  Despite this, 95% fully endorsed LibLabCon last GE. Ppl just getting what they voted for, so cannot complain, never mind issue silly warrants.

Unfortunately so far she is words no action

Therefore the leftie is racist just as much as Hitler was, just that the lefty's racism is against their own race. It is in their genes.

1329486893650677760 2020-11-20 02:09:10 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @MichaelYeadon3 What is going on is that $£millions, no, $£billions are flowing in the corrupt river of public money. Many exclusive mansions will be bought next year on the back of all the new millionaires the Coronovirus has generated

1329485674358124545 2020-11-20 02:04:20 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @timbofive Elections cancelled, unless the sitting politician is Trump, then elections are okay. In Britain Mayor Khan just stayed on as Mayor and the election was cancelled 'due to coronovirus'  and they decided to cancel democracy for now, so you cannot vote but you can shop.
1329484960026267653 2020-11-20 02:01:29 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @wiganwoody ... and if you assume those 'dying of Covid' would still be alive without Covid, as the politicians &amp; msm imply is the case by the way they present the data, if you assume this then the low death rate from other causes is a miracle.
1329483957356933129 2020-11-20 01:57:30 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Common_Sense_71 This is because their prophet is perfect and as he did it it must be okay.
1329483510755758081 2020-11-20 01:55:44 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @EternalEnglish What we really need is some proof that the elite and those who push for the vaccine really have taken it themselves and are not simply allowed to self-certify, by special permission, being 'more equal'. Drs supporting the New Normal so they can do less work are in this category.
1329482845711163400 2020-11-20 01:53:05 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @zombie_nun Also, if there is a street with only a few chargers, those who get home from work before everyone else (eg teachers) could hog the few chargers whilst everyone else gets angry. This already happens where ppl incorrectly claim the spot outside their house. Will lead to conflict.
1329480153609728003 2020-11-20 01:42:23 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @JamiePaterson26 @Nellfr16 @d5_rss @BBCNews Correct, but the ones agreeing with you so far are an anarchist and FBPE person, so the three of you roughly represent the political make up of a typical staff room in Britain. You seem like you might be a teacher yourself.
1329447157850583047 2020-11-19 23:31:17 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @SteveLaws_ Modern generation is self-centred, pampered, spoilt, indoctrinated and cannot see the flaw in joining 'the winning group' when the winning group is anti-white and they themselves are white.
1329446116472086532 2020-11-19 23:27:08 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Kalimeralynn @wilkiegog I cannot see GPs ever giving up the 'New Normal' way of earning their massive salaries for less work and less interaction with patients, and I have already received texts from my GP's practice confirming this.
1329445363837788161 2020-11-19 23:24:09 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Reprobate24 ... the date will be whenever it impacts on their bank balance and house value - currently postponed due to irresponsible public spending/bribing on furlough scheme.
1329443433325465600 2020-11-19 23:16:29 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @EternalEnglish Imagine the next War - all enemy combatants given 4* hotels and a lawyer just as these enemy combatants currently arriving on the South Coast are, and more legal rights than our own soldiers, including the right to call us racist names, whilst we are jailed if we call them names.

1329419593912360960 2020-11-19 21:41:45 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @GerardBattenUK Another own goal by the left - a big one. They are not wise or co-ordinated &amp; mainly do things just on their inner urges. Same applies to mslms - the govt desperately wants them to 'keep a lid on it' until they are the majority, but they cannot restrain their urges to attack now.

In the same way, on Classic FM Radio they are bowing in awe &amp; reverence at any piece their editors find written by a minority, then promoting it
1329399831631196161 2020-11-19 20:23:13 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Good point, the left score many own goals, eg supporting BLM rioting &amp; XR anarchy &amp; closing down our energy provision to 'go green', &amp; especially their demand that men in skirts can use the girls' toilets. Some ppl fast asleep though &amp; take a lot of slapping by the L to waken up
1329381772778409986 2020-11-19 19:11:28 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Doctors are fully in on the scam, as they are reaping huge huge rewards for colluding - a 'New Normal' where they do even less work for the same pay, and not even having to see patients except rarely, after the sick person has waited in the rain &amp; cold for permission to enter.
1329380225139044352 2020-11-19 19:05:19 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Nellfr16 @d5_rss @BBCNews Stormzy's lyrics are probably studied in schools as poetry in place of Rudyard Kipling.
1329378664862117888 2020-11-19 18:59:07 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> I will go to Aldi over Xmas and avoid the woke stores, especially Sainsbury's
1329374355730669568 2020-11-19 18:41:59 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Hmm... looks like some foreign country is interfering in the domestic politics of the USA.  Shh! we are not allowed to notice, or say anything.   Just remember their H-story and submit yourselves to any punishment that they deem fit to bring down upon us for 6m imagined wrongs
1329371829744627712 2020-11-19 18:31:57 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @emmakennytv @wilkiegog He knows how to get promotion in modern sick Britain where the enemy-within are in charge and supported by the colluding msm

1329370752668340230 2020-11-19 18:27:40 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Article1066 You must admit though that if the govt gave you a special machine to print money and were allowed to do it legally and as much as you want, you too would be tempted to print off a few million, then a few million more, and so on, although the banks' machines print off billions
1329370162752065539 2020-11-19 18:25:19 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @eatyourgardn Some ppl even when in actual internment camps themselves, will still not realise the govt is trying to tightly control all our lives as in '1984', and some in the actual camps will still think the govt is doing it all for their own good or because of a virus.
1329369318522490880 2020-11-19 18:21:58 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Fairy_Woodland Meanwhile, in rap they can say b**ch &amp; the n-word &amp; basically anything they want, just as cyclists can ride wherever they want, &amp; anyone can say anything they want against w ppl, &amp; all that happens if the police observe is that they get on their knees &amp; bow to the new elite
1329366994043482113 2020-11-19 18:12:44 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Most young ppl have no idea how hard our ancestors worked &amp; how much hardship &amp; suffering they endured to provide us with our current pampered lives- which they are currently willing to lose just so as not to be 'racist'. Racism is actually defending what we have from the hostile
1329365573785051136 2020-11-19 18:07:05 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Most young ppl have no idea how hard our ancestors had to work &amp; how much disease &amp; hardship they had to suffer, in order to provide today's generation their pampered &amp; safe &amp; comfortable lifestyle - which, by the way, they will not have for long if they do not wake up soon.

1329364439737528323 2020-11-19 18:02:35 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Our msm TV presenters and these types are in total political agreement, it is just that the msm are better at posing as respectable.

1329344736893788161 2020-11-19 16:44:17 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @bagshot26 @ez_dee There is the 'true left' who hate white/better races &amp; do not care about the truth re the virus, then there is the msm-watching 'indoctrinated left' who will readily switch sides when they are awakened, and hardship + sufficiently free internet is waking them up fast now.
1329343876914671616 2020-11-19 16:40:52 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> As hardship increases for whites, more will start to look at the reasons in alternt. media.   Hardship + still enough internet freedom to communicate = awakening with snowball effect  Until recently, hardship component was pretty low, but now this is increasing ppl are waking up
1329340252486557702 2020-11-19 16:26:28 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Stephen55509814 @ez_dee At present 5% are awake, but if it gets to 10% that will have a massive difference (snowball, avalanche effect) especially if many of them are wealthy &amp; have influence, &amp; let the other 90% queue for now, as the msm &amp; enemy-within gov directs them to. Fewer will Q in near future.
1329339441622691842 2020-11-19 16:23:15 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Terrence7750 @ez_dee The collapse of ppl's safety &amp; services is happening at a rapid rate &amp; soon their $£ will collapse, AND at the same time the internet is still free enough for ppl to find the reasons. More and more will look up alternative news in the near future as the decline intensifies.
1329338396456718337 2020-11-19 16:19:06 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @GLawson194 @ez_dee This generation is rich &amp; pampered. Their biggest decision is whether to buy new trainers or a new phone, and the collapse of the NHS does not affect them. But they will think differently fairly soon when the Great Decline from the Great Reset finally impacts on them properly.
1329336176256413698 2020-11-19 16:10:16 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> I hope they are not all just 'forgiven' in the same was the Russians &amp; E.Germans forgave all the communists when the USSR &amp; allies abandoned communism a few decades ago &amp; let the commies run the new regimes also.
1329335630971760641 2020-11-19 16:08:06 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @ez_dee The awakening is happening right now at a high rate as, whilst society collapses, at the same time there is still enough freedom to look up the real reasons in alternative media. Basically the left ((&amp;allies)) failed to control the internet as tightly as they control the msm.
1329334202341453829 2020-11-19 16:02:26 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @AaronWrightAfc @ez_dee Don't worry, the asleep will awaken when the decline finally affects that which is most dear to them - not their country or people or disappearing culture or their heritage, or even their children's futures - no, that which is most dear to them is THEIR HOUSE VALUE and their $
1329331877895938050 2020-11-19 15:53:12 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @SteveLaws_ @2tweetaboutit As you are reading this the goct are arranging 4* hotel accommodation for the 'homeless child refugees' with beards (and Korans), meanwhile many of our veterans remain homeless.
1329331160321839110 2020-11-19 15:50:21 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @GerardBattenUK It is curious how in the DM the top comments are more anti-Trump whilst at the same time the sub-comments are strongly pro-Trump. Maybe there is innocent explanation, or maybe the anti-Trump New World Order DM is faking the comments now as well as the news  https://t.co/VpFBlCcrhd
1329156492772118528 2020-11-19 04:16:17 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Right now the authorities are arranging 4* hotel accommodation for the 'refugee kids', and lawyers are offering their services.

Otherwise, in Traitor May's constituency, they would have replaced this open-border pro-EU traitor with the UKIP candidate at the last GE
1329145266625187850 2020-11-19 03:31:40 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Zoomertron @GerardBattenUK Maybe it is real, but as total deaths are similar to other years, it is just like a normal flu or perhaps a bit worse, but certainly not worth wrecking the nation for. Perhaps the govt are using it as an excuse to take us closer to 1984, which is why they fudge the figures

1329143453012398083 2020-11-19 03:24:28 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @ToonCoyne @GerardBattenUK Shop keepers also seem immune, but doctors seem to have to hide away (except for giving us the jab that will earn them £12 a time (&amp; a bit for Bill Gates?))   Maybe those who have to hide away should forfeit their pay and give it to those who still go to work?

That kind of question could crash the system. There was an episode in 'Prisoner' in the 60s where Patrick McGowan asked a super computer just 'why?' on its own and it blew up. Your irresponsible question could do the same.

But, like Edward &amp; Mrs S, he has genes that make him go for this dominant type. Sad.

In disputes where ebay 'resolves' it ebay NEVER takes the loss themselves &amp; either the buyer or the seller pays, often ebay picking the wrong one as they employ ppl with no judgement. Problem is there is no-one above them to complain to.

The clue is in the Finance Minister's name. British traitors Soames &amp; Carrington handed S.Rhodesia to China-backed Mugabe (later 'Sir Robert Mugabe' to show whose side they were on)
1329008147751727104 2020-11-18 18:26:48 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @eBay_UK ebay you give appalling customer service. Anyone who looks you up on Trust Pilot can confirm this. Your Feedback Scores are FAKE for a start as I gave -ve feedback and you removed it as seller was a 'Power Seller'

Ebay REMOVED the negative feedback I gave as he was a 'Power Seller'.
1329004564817842177 2020-11-18 18:12:34 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Jackbaglan @eBay_UK ebay do not realise the basic principle that if they gave proper customer service &amp; refunds that they would have happy customers and more profits in the end. An unhappy customer stops using them and they lose out more in the end than the, eg, £20 they refused to refund you.

Did you know ebay do not allow -ve feedback feedback if the seller gives you a refund on the last day of a drawn out dispute, if the seller is a 'power seller'. ebay protects their 100% rating so their ratings are FALSE.

Otherwise, deaths this year would be zero instead of the normal 1600 per day we always get, adjusted for seasonal variations.

Look what they did to N.Rhodesia &amp; SAfrica under her watch. She gave the impression that the Tories were more right wing than they really were.

This will not happen until the decline reaches the level where it significantly affects people's standard of living and safety - most are still rich and pampered, but that will soon change.

Eg I am sure the police did not 'buy it' that the mature man immgnt they were looking for really was a 14 yr old boy as they asserted - they were SUBMITTING to the left's narrative, not 'buying it'
1327584383289745408 2020-11-14 20:09:16 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> They get away with it in the msm simply because those voices that would challenge the narrative are simply not allowed a say.  But they are not getting away with it on the internet, for those who make a little effort to have a look, but for many appeasers they do not want to look

1327579325986697216 2020-11-14 19:49:11 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @GOVUK Is it true that NHS absenteeism levels are now over 30% &amp; have been for a year (on full pay)?  Is it true you can ring up &amp; cough &amp; get 2 wks off?  Why do msm never print absenteeism levels of NHS &amp; teachers? Are they covering for you as they are on board with the 'Great Reset'?
1327551850334330884 2020-11-14 18:00:00 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> .. the NHS only gets away with it because the msm is covering for them. Eg corrupt msm never mention NHS absenteeism levels (30%? - no figures in msm, why not, I think we know - because they are so high)  They abandoned their posts (on 100% pay) &amp; the clapping made them worse
1327547731267739648 2020-11-14 17:43:38 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Jennyashash @wilkiegog Another difference is that the staff absenteeism is much higher this year - 30%+ I understand, as all you need to do is ring up and cough and you get 2 weeks off. They abandoned their posts en masse &amp; still Tesco gives them priority! The clapping made them even worse

The Cons are a mass immign from the 3rd world party, and have been for decades. They also support the foreign aid corrupt industry and support the green agenda - eg Didcot power station DEMOLISHED not just mothballed.

We could have 50+ UKIP MPs in plmnt by now, but the ppl shunned the only Party that reflected their views.

They used to get the odd day off from 1/4" snow, now just ring up school &amp; cough &amp; get 2 weeks off

But the winner of fake-statistics is Britain, as we count anyone who tests positive for the virus 28 days before death as a Covid death. The (deliberate) error here is basic foundation maths level
1327210197698437121 2020-11-13 19:22:24 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> This is why our enemy-within govt sabotaged our energy provision.

Govt did this to make us vulnerable to foreign bullying, or submitted to others who did want us to be.
1327195063840071680 2020-11-13 18:22:15 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> It is called 'negative advertising' where they pay money for adverts that put people off their products.  Sainsburys is the winner as they actually told their customers to shop elsewhere if they do not support BLM.

This is  important as you could get an infection. Tooth decay was once a major cause of death, and deaths from bad teeth will increase, possibly falsely recorded as a 'Covid death' to justify the 'new normal'.

They could stop voting for open-border Tory traitors for a start. They chose traitor May last GE in her constituency over the UKIP candidate last G.E.
1326957789550436367 2020-11-13 02:39:25 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @wiganwoody Meantime, the police are spending time and money hunting down someone who put some leaflets about immigration through some letter boxes.
1326957332111175680 2020-11-13 02:37:36 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @MaureenDalby @piersmorgan If they recorded anyone who ate toast in the 28 days before death as a 'toast death' they would discover that the main cause of death in Britain is toast, beating cancer easily. The error of equating 'death with' and 'death from' would make a good GCSE foundation level maths Q
1326949866283659267 2020-11-13 02:07:56 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @MeMyselfAndI369 @PaulMer53 @W3l5hL393nd Indirectly, the voters let them in, as despite May being an open door politician as Home Sec &amp; PM, despite this (and dancing with S African leaders), the Con voters SHUNNED G Batten's UKIP in her constituency at the last GE &amp; put her back in parliamnt. All our misery is voted for

Chances are you would NOT get free £, lawyer, dr, council house or hotel, and there is actually a significant chance that you would be beaten to death.

They might finally start to help more when the diversity reaches them also.

She would have been ecstatic if she could have brought on the NWO as much as he has.

1326885691352027136 2020-11-12 21:52:55 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> ... it all happened because the msm &amp; schools persuaded this generation to vote for their own demise.   The ppl can now see the results all around them, but still think they are being 'virtuous' and 'non-racist' in keeping us firmly on course to be soon white minority &amp; outvoted
1326876205992325121 2020-11-12 21:15:14 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom If you look at the comments on Twitter under Boris's announcement, you can see that no-one is falling for his deceitful words this time about 'delivering on the promise we made to the British ppl'
1326843133473263616 2020-11-12 19:03:49 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @nastymutant @RGoldblatzberg When was the last time a TV ad showed a woman doing housework? At least a year, now it is only men.  In school textbooks the most common profession for young women is bus driver/lorry driver.  The best job a woman can do is homemaker, not a 'career' as msm/school advocate
1326839090311000064 2020-11-12 18:47:45 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @MichaelYeadon3 @goddersbloom The virus is not allowed 'to go' until the well-connected have got their millions/billions from the vaccines &amp; testing procedures. This is not just an overflowing pig's feeding trough, it is a huge river of money flowing into all 'the right' pockets and nothing will stop this.
1326836640493531136 2020-11-12 18:38:01 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom The number who died and had eaten bread or rice in the preceding 28 days is also around 50,000.  Neither the bread, the rice nor the Covid was the main cause of death.
1326834925434269696 2020-11-12 18:31:12 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom Where is this Going Postal blog please?
1326834642423574528 2020-11-12 18:30:04 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom In one sense ppl now trade in land and property, as this is where they hold their wealth, as it is limited and the gov cannot print/make more (except for massive house building projects for immigs). So when it costs 250,000 for the av house, this represents paper money inflation
1326833604664700928 2020-11-12 18:25:57 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom Charles is already learning some of the consequences of his belief system through the way Harry's life has turned out.
1326832906728247297 2020-11-12 18:23:10 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> If we recorded anyone who ate toast in the 28 days before their death as 'a toast death', we would find that toast is almost the only cause of death in this country.
1326832502271578112 2020-11-12 18:21:34 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom If  govt/msm can get away with counting as a Covid death anyone who tested +ve (in an unreliable test) in the preceding 28 days, if they can get away with such a blatant deception at such a basic level of maths/stats/data misinterpretation, then they can get away with anything.
1326814104091242496 2020-11-12 17:08:28 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @GerardBattenUK It must be tricky supervising the ppl as you attempt to hit the indigenous half with one hand and grovel on the floor in submission to the other half.
1326807601317883904 2020-11-12 16:42:37 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> For how long are the indigenous ppl going to remain submissive under these attacks?  Answer: until we reach the stage where it impacts on the thing most precious to the ppl of this country, for the wealthy it is their house value, &amp; for the poor it is their welfare income.
1326780846347522051 2020-11-12 14:56:18 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @MissDomergue Police forced to humiliate themselves by having to pretend they believe this man is 14.  They know we know that they do not believe this. Just like the USSR - must repeat the outrageous official claims/slogans/lies when everyone knows they are nonsense. A form of submission

You could not get away with it except for the msm covering for you on this one, which they do whenever you submit to their agenda.

1326603515003883520 2020-11-12 03:11:39 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @sergiez @GowTolson It reminds me of the ridiculous slogans in the USSR claiming Stalin was 'for the ppl' etc. You were not meant to actually believe them, just as you are not meant to think the 'coloured' issue is valid. You are just meant to realise who is in charge and submit to them.
1326601558654652417 2020-11-12 03:03:53 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @simondolan Those who trust the vaccine can take it first and in so doing are testing it out for the rest of us.

He reaches out to the far-left and turns his back on those who voted him in.   The only thing in his favour is that he does not seem to be happy to be on this path of treachery, whereas May loved being a traitor to her ppl

The pitbull is programmed in its genes for its harm-causing behaviour, and it cannot be retrained. In the end many pitbulls bite their owner's children and end up being put down.

Find out who is involved in this deliberately faulty design. I would not be surprised if the trail leads to China &amp; the Dems

1326213662005190663 2020-11-11 01:22:31 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> I hope that in the end this act of election interference by Fox News causes them huge fines, and the same goes for Twitter etc interfering by censoring Trump's tweets.

1326164511666081792 2020-11-10 22:07:13 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @rob_miller12345 - if not this year, compulsory vaccination for 'key workers'  will happen next year when the next seasonal 'flu virus comes along and is exaggerated into another Covid.

Maybe just 10% more than now, including some rich ones would do it. Hardship, + complacent rich whites losing their wealth due to socialism, might be the trigger

I suspect his ratings plummeted due to going against his audience in this way. Get woke, go broke. Trump should buy Fox News.

1325795359419985921 2020-11-09 21:40:20 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Twitter needs sorting out. Only Trump would do it, as most of the rest of the politicians in all white countries are on the side of Twitter and against their own people. I wish ppl would stop voting for the enemy-within.

The govt would not dare to publish skiving levels in the state sector, and so instead we clap them as they sit at home after abandoning their posts.

1325731913139707905 2020-11-09 17:28:13 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @GerardBattenUK The only problem is that voters vote tribally &amp; so most end up voting  for a candidate with OPPOSITE views to their own.

They have not spotted the flaw in this - the final outcome for them when they win

1325531098345070596 2020-11-09 04:10:15 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @ThisIsREngland @RGoldblatzberg I accept that likely Trump did win, but the election fraud would not have been possible if the stupid w ppl had only done the right thing &amp; had voted in much larger numbers for Trump. The handing over of their country to 3rd world is totally self-inflicted by whites.
1325530172997701637 2020-11-09 04:06:35 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @The_Ayatollah_ @RGoldblatzberg They know they can never get in trouble if they obey the new elite, just as Boris knows that the same elite will give him an easy time as long as he keeps on doing their bidding eg obeying the elites' lockdown 'scientific advisors' - otherwise they will set the msm on Boris.
1325527437422325760 2020-11-09 03:55:42 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @RGoldblatzberg Ppl still believe WWII was 'for freedom'  as they do not want to admit that they fell for govt lies &amp; went into a war that was against their own interests &amp; helped communism &amp; also launched the H industry. Some even believe it was 'to free Poland' despite us handing Poles to USSR
1325164635109040130 2020-11-08 03:54:04 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @ThisIsREngland Disagree re 9/11 1)If it was faked they would not have used Saudis, our 'allies' 2) msm never show the pics of ppl falling so they downplay event. 3)Terrorsts just doing what they always do &amp;still do 4)They would have learned to land also as it nearly gave them away - basic error
1325134830603038720 2020-11-08 01:55:38 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @itsjillgardner Interesting. I can confirm this with my own experience - a good night's sleep gives me a much lower appetite. Also, a study suggested this is why shift workers put on weight.

They did not want the trail leading back to Wuhan like it did.

1325083980547432450 2020-11-07 22:33:34 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @UKmacD @itsjillgardner @simondolan Fewer than 5% have the ability to think clearly. The rest are sheeple. Most trust the TV and newspapers and cannot see the bias. Eg all news bulletins assert that 'Trump has no evidence of voter fraud' and 95% accept this fake news lie.
1325082230155321348 2020-11-07 22:26:37 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> This is a good post. The communists take over because a significant minority of nobodies strongly support it. When the USSR ballet toured the West there was no need for KGB agents to spy on them as they willingly reported defectors from their own group without this.
1325078913895297027 2020-11-07 22:13:26 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @GerardBattenUK Also, when you go for the Covid vaccine (Drs surgeries usually closed &amp; staff hiding away can suddenly see you again now they are getting £12 per vaccine given!) you are mixing with staff who mix with 100 other patients that day - this will spread the virus if anything does.

No need to bribe the willing.

1324999615649902594 2020-11-07 16:58:20 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @BeComfy If a group of whites set up a colony on the moon, the anti-white white elite on earth would not rest until they had either sent a rocket full of Nigerians to join you (along with affirmative action/also called positive discrimination), or sent a missile to blow up the moon.
1324995006621421568 2020-11-07 16:40:01 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Semiogogue @Henrik_Palmgren The sad thing is that 'modern art' can fetch more money than heritage antiques, and modern cult books like 'Harry Potter 1st edition' attract big money also. If the rich were as interested in their heritage as they are in big yachts to show off in, we would not be in this mess

1324993192102686721 2020-11-07 16:32:48 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Or, imagine if the people had just 10% more ability to discern bias in the msm reporting, such as the fake-news claim made in every news item on the US election in Britain (including the 'right-wing' Daily Mail newspaper) that 'Trump has no evidence of voter fraud'
1324988710987948032 2020-11-07 16:15:00 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @TOOEdit if the anti-w regime wins, Js need the new regime that they helped to install to continue to look kindly on them with their H-story and give them $ and military support in Israel. The signs are not good for them as the left side with Palestine in the land dispute with Israel.
1324985849868668928 2020-11-07 16:03:38 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> The same reason a fox kills ALL the hens in the hen coop instead of just the one it needs to eat - there is no benefit to the fox and it is just wired in its behaviour do kill for fun 'because it can', and one outcome is that it causes a reaction - the farmer kills the fox.
1324791921647230976 2020-11-07 03:13:02 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @goddersbloom This NHS manager will be organising security to stop ppl using 'their' hospital, eg all doors in large Manchester hospital have security on to stop you going in, even A&amp;E. Once you are in there are also special doors only for going out again.
1324784494952484865 2020-11-07 02:43:31 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> They are arrogant as they think they are closer to nature and further from 'evil' Western manufacturing &amp; technology. In fact their bikes are the outcome of decades of advanced technology, all parts delivered by lorry also. A hand-made 'nature-bike' is not feasible.
1324782293186191363 2020-11-07 02:34:46 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @GerardBattenUK "No evidence of collusion" says every Classic FM news bulletin.  How does msm know this if they refuse to investigate voting fraud? What they mean is 'we refuse to investigate or print  evidence'. Contrast this with the hrs/weeks/yrs they spent looking for Russian collusion

1324666412070277120 2020-11-06 18:54:18 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @LBilderberg Sometimes random events happen (Wuhan virus escapes) &amp; the elite catches on as to how it can use them (in this case, the virus) for its agenda, rather than planning it all from the start. But certainly they might deliberately generate a re-run next yr for a 'new virus'
1324664903014191105 2020-11-06 18:48:18 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @MrCEssex1 'we can't stop cancers from developing'  The NHS could if they went back to work. Most of the staff enjoying the 'new normal' level of work/non-work on full pay are keeping quiet about the horrific scandal as they are enjoying the new way of non-working on full pay.
1324664092855066624 2020-11-06 18:45:05 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Some good news at last. Sainsbury's should appoint a 'positive discrimination' board of ethnic directors, eg British Nigerians and Somalians, and same with all senior management, immediately, in accordance with their principles.

The ppl are not yet ready to put their thinking hats on.
1324660827622957056 2020-11-06 18:32:06 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> msm declares Trump has no evidence for voter fraud, yet fails to investigate the evidence that is in abundance

Surely this proves Trump's point about bias msm. msm-DM also calls his speech a rant, which is the far-left angle
1324647963096944640 2020-11-06 17:40:59 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @ThisIsREngland The w ppl still had one last chance to unite in the US &amp; put Trump in with enough votes to overcome the massive Dem fraud, but, as usual, a section of the whites voted against themselves. We are the only race where a significant minority of the ppl are strongly against their own

A few generations later their white descendants decided to give it to 3rd world by voting anti-w to fit in with current dominant msm-driven culture.

1324641036375859200 2020-11-06 17:13:28 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> They get away with it by bribing half the ppl to stay at home on 80% wages doing nothing &amp; state employees on 100% wages at home doing 5% of normal - which was low anyway. Ppl take the bribe &amp; let the country sink.

Only G Batten's UKIP had any intention of reducing immign, but UKIP were shunned by the voters, whereas we could easily now have 50+ UKIP MPs in parliamnt. 95%+ of the ppl at last G.E. who votred LibLabCon endorsed mass immig &amp; these ppl cannot complain

There is temptation to simply record 5 positives though if the procedure is not followed correctly, either due to incompetence or due to a desire to fake the figures.

A fake-news govt will readily encourage fake-statistics. Politics is more important to the authorities than science

1322488855166099459 2020-10-31 18:41:28 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> The diff. is that the ppl of Pakistan follow a type of racism where they FAVOUR their own, whereas in Britain we follow the type of racism that is HOSTILE to our own race. The w ppl of Britain would rather submit &amp; be conquered than become 'racist' and survive &amp; prosper

The ppl were given full democracy, &amp; over the decades they used it to vote for politicians with the OPPOSITE views to their own - they voted for, and still vote for, open-border traitors who do not even hide their animosity towards this country.
1322109584253820929 2020-10-30 17:34:23 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @MartinTwigs68 The govt think it is okay because the ppl fully endorse their open-border policy both in the past AND AT THE LAST G.E.. Only Batten's UKIP would have put the brakes on imign, but the ppl shunned UKIP &amp; voted for open border parties LibLabCon AGAIN
1322109019398561792 2020-10-30 17:32:08 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @Mr__XYZ The white wkg class have patriotic views, eg they want the border closed, but the problem is that over the decades they mainly vote for politicians with the OPPOSITE views to their own. Eg w.w.class in Gorton, Manch, voted for Mohammad Khan (LAB), together with local immigts.

Proof that most politicians in the West are far-left is that all W nations have open borders to the 3rd world. MSM support the narrative.

How many millions to enter for how many decades before Con voters realise Con is open-border?
1319628940713947143 2020-10-23 21:17:11 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @GerardBattenUK Communism offers all the nobodies the chance to suddenly have power and authority as grasses &amp; also just to order others about 'for their own good and for the good of the people'. The police seem to be loving it also - easier than solving real crime.

1318857936052101120 2020-10-21 18:13:29 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @NickGriffinBU Stage 1 is reached when the indigenous get to the point where they have had enough of the anti-white agenda and rule by their Lefty subsection. Stage 2 is when they gradually realise that they should stop voting for anti-W parties with the OPPOSITE views to their own (LibLabCon)

The MPs do not hide their views. T May danced with the bl leaders in S Africa who persecute whites and her constituents STILL voted for this traitor.

How much does the Tory party have to stamp on their voters before they stop endorsing this open-border Party with top posts for ethnics?

What treachery level do the traitor Tories have to reach before the penny finally drops that they are an open-border party that is against us?

They even voted T May back in as MP after she danced with bl leaders in S Africa who persecute w ppl
1317869760521134081 2020-10-19 00:46:50 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> At least half of these concerned locals who do not want the immigrants will have voted at the last election for one of the open border parties (LibLabCon) and therefore such voters have no right to complain as they are just getting what they keep voting for over the decades.

1317486095936983041 2020-10-17 23:22:17 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @nastymutant I think it was Victoria Wood who made a BBC documentary about New Zealand, and said regarding the Maoris &amp; the British, 'How was it that you (the Maoris) were unable to repel the invaders (the British)?' The BBC narrative is always one way only - against whites.

Empty hospitals are far easier to manage &amp; the nurse's no longer get interrupted discussing their parties at the service stations
1314196850015006724 2020-10-08 21:32:00 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @GerardBattenUK The NHS will count that as a 'success' as the queue for cancer treatment has just decreased by one, so another target is in reach and soon there will be bonuses all round for the 'management team'. Cleanliness targets are also much easier to reach without any patients around.

Of course the councillors themselves retire early on huge pensions and live away from the mess and crime they cause. But now the immgn &amp; crime is spreading to the wealthy areas too!
1312041426528751617 2020-10-02 22:47:07 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> Correct, except that the ppl did ask for all of it.

1311619754302615556 2020-10-01 18:51:32 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @GerardBattenUK Also the no-principles politicians know that the MSM will be kind to them if they obey the MSM narrative of being anti-white &amp; close down economy. Eg the MSM will also destroy Pritti Patel if she closes the border. The politicians submit &amp; commit treachery to save their careers.
1311618887172141057 2020-10-01 18:48:06 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @GerardBattenUK Notice that the same crowd (the elite + countless nobodies including some on this thread) who want to close down economy over Covid also want to saboutage our energy provision BUT NOT CHINA'S - revealing that 'saving planet' is not the real motive, hatred of w ppl is the motive
1311618250900471808 2020-10-01 18:45:34 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> @GerardBattenUK The urge to bring down the econmy is from same type who want to close down our energy provision('CO2')&amp; they are not all powerful, plenty of nobodies (eg on this thread!) The urges arise from a hatred of the superior (which = wh ppl, their own race) due to lefty genes in whites.

Perhaps if we finally ended up like  https://t.co/hcYjk0hYt1 where it was more like anarchy than 1984 type control, I suspect they would be equally happy with such an outcome, as the motive is white-hate (superior-hatred) more than control
1310175228799188993 2020-09-27 19:11:31 +0800 <pterodactyl1984> They get an immediate face to face checkup with a Dr when they arrive  - which we cannot get (a) within a week (b) not face to face unlike they get -  and so I do not doubt they would also get immediate dental treatment also (unlike us).
