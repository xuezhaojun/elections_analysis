1344051387747856384 2020-12-30 06:43:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Hoosiers1986 Only a few politicians apparently.
1344029468474494978 2020-12-30 05:16:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Destiny3650 @BenJackd1 This man needs locking up.
1344028042427953152 2020-12-30 05:10:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @twatterbaas It is disgraceful.
1343849150010388480 2020-12-29 17:19:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @jenniferatntd @justonepatriot @SidneyPowell1 @LLinWood @marklevinshow @MariaBartiromo @TomFitton @JosephJFlynn1 @BarbaraRedgate @GoJackFlynn @SaraCarterDC @docdhj @JanJekielek Who in politics doesn’t have interests in dominion.
1343707040913342464 2020-12-29 07:54:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Kaycecda @realDonaldTrump Why not? People need to know the truth.
1343706370265116672 2020-12-29 07:52:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @chuckwoolery These people all they ever talk about is someone’s skin color. Who are the racists?
1343705876515844098 2020-12-29 07:50:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealMarkLatham Although don’t give them ideas, they might replay this years grand final &amp; we would have to watch the tigers win again.
1343705315599024128 2020-12-29 07:48:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealMarkLatham Always thinking mark.
1343701311984812032 2020-12-29 07:32:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @christina_bobb @AtomicPunk57 Yes all he answers with is something about ponies with dog faces.
1343686884988358657 2020-12-29 06:34:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RyanAFournier Another actor who thinks his opinion is important.
1343686579311661056 2020-12-29 06:33:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @thehill That means she could win every debate &amp; he is a twat.
1343685021631037441 2020-12-29 06:27:28 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EricMMatheny They are succeeding then.
1343677572085780480 2020-12-29 05:57:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ThomasSowell Seems like it. We don’t have to listen to this nonsense though.
1343677345723342849 2020-12-29 05:56:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @barmore27 If I knew what a one horse pony was.
1343676802682609665 2020-12-29 05:54:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DailyCaller Does he even know what that means.
1343674538140168193 2020-12-29 05:45:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @hooksbaited So called celebrities should stop thinking the world revolves around them &amp; their opinions.
1343673013871419392 2020-12-29 05:39:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KamVTV Maybe hedging their bets. But I think people will remember the RINOs.
1343672407135932416 2020-12-29 05:37:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @whatgives1313 I say leave the sun alone. He is a complete maniac.
1343670255499952128 2020-12-29 05:28:47 +0800 <bluesjack42> @barmore27 I think they have been investigated but nothing has been done.
1343669602220314624 2020-12-29 05:26:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @hooksbaited No lying should be top of that list.
1343668834926878720 2020-12-29 05:23:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DailyCaller How exactly? By just letting anyone cross the border.
1343661325780623360 2020-12-29 04:53:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @soulshine41 Yes
1343661032162512896 2020-12-29 04:52:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrMichaelBurkes He is very uninspiring.
1343528646925930497 2020-12-28 20:06:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PRGuy17 Tim flannery followed very closely by the sour puss one.
1343528323511513089 2020-12-28 20:04:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SlimKraken She looks every bit of 85.
1343527714230190080 2020-12-28 20:02:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BaronBlacky Care factor.
1343526714278772738 2020-12-28 19:58:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @edwardoo___ @GrahamAllen_1 @JoeBiden Work??? He doesn’t know if it’s morning or afternoon.
1343526251848331264 2020-12-28 19:56:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden Platitudes.
1343459161195986944 2020-12-28 15:29:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @WildOrca56 @JoeSilverman7 Mrs doubtfire. Ridiculous.
1343459043226968065 2020-12-28 15:29:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @WildOrca56 @JoeSilverman7 George Clooney in gravity. Absolutely ridiculous.
1343458634122989569 2020-12-28 15:27:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @WildOrca56 @JoeSilverman7 It was how she looked like she had just died after a few days. Ridiculous.
1343361488371605505 2020-12-28 09:01:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TigerTamer8 I’m tearful again. So happy for Truman.
1343360594938753025 2020-12-28 08:58:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Peter217945 He needs counseling immediately.
1343360290730041344 2020-12-28 08:57:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Keomaste A 1 million house in south Australia would be pretty nice &amp; use the rest to live on.
1343359935829008384 2020-12-28 08:55:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @michaeljknowles Definitely not the truth.
1343355633785946113 2020-12-28 08:38:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @bette_oh Was there anyone in his little circle of deviates he wasn’t having an affair with??
1343354587063840769 2020-12-28 08:34:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BreitbartNews This man should be locked up for treason or put away in a mental institution.
1343353265568681985 2020-12-28 08:29:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @leftcoastbabe @DanRather @noitsleviOsah The bill should have been just about a stimulus package for Americans struggling. The other bs should have been dealt with separately.
1343352232209629189 2020-12-28 08:25:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @netz_melb There are many reasons not to vote in bill shorten.
1343303814414135297 2020-12-28 05:12:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @cLRA8rAiXvcfMpC Sorry yes bought.
1343303534691770369 2020-12-28 05:11:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @NickAdamsinUSA I think he should do something instead of mumbling out platitudes or plagiarizing others’s platitudes. It is really sad to see someone being allowed to embarrass himself. He is not well.
1343299924721483776 2020-12-28 04:57:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @dbongino She is not a nice person &amp; people are afraid to tell her that. How she achieved such a powerful position is unbelievable. Term limits necessary.
1343296425895972864 2020-12-28 04:43:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @pam_sands @TrumpRulzz I suppose whether you are a politician for the party in power or opposition you still get paid regularly &amp; all the perks that go with it. So the hell with making a stand.
1343295669256122370 2020-12-28 04:40:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ChrisMo37540912 Does he realize he is white. Not that it matters bc that would be racist to consider what color a person is as a requirement for a position.

1343288499357675521 2020-12-28 04:11:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @michaeljknowles @KamalaHarris It’s not that she actually celebrated Christmas but that she can’t seem to get a handle on the truth.
1343286284073123841 2020-12-28 04:03:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @OMGTheMess I love sarcasm.

1343086953785303040 2020-12-27 14:50:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CindyProUSA @stuffcanwait These politicians who retire with millions. Very suspicious.

1343020745572581376 2020-12-27 10:27:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mbracemoore I’m sorry she doesn’t come across very well. Just condescending bc you know her history I guess.

1343018381234978818 2020-12-27 10:18:28 +0800 <bluesjack42> @liquidlaugh @plbrocks You couldn’t make up rubbish like having Biden a candidate for president. Really.

1343016442141179904 2020-12-27 10:10:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ElijahSchaffer These are just not interesting, funny &amp; really so unnecessary.
1343014496684498944 2020-12-27 10:03:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore Don’t know.
1342967138366021633 2020-12-27 06:54:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @joshdcaplan Didn’t a certain president say something about this &amp; msm went into meltdown. If only they hadn’t many lives could have been saved probably.
1342957769079443456 2020-12-27 06:17:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MajorPatriot I wish I did.

1342953368659009537 2020-12-27 06:00:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealMarkLatham Windy &amp; cool here in south Australia too this morning.
1342819988512538628 2020-12-26 21:10:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @53pamela_h You have to be joking.
1342610749311471616 2020-12-26 07:18:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden Oh give it up mate.
1342595296279240705 2020-12-26 06:17:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Peter217945 I would rather go to the dentist than listen to this depressing tirade of misinformation.
1342594372886429697 2020-12-26 06:13:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @jamiesonmurph Have not seen one this year. What does it mean?
1342573138110869504 2020-12-26 04:49:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Hoosiers1986 Well it is probably happening all over the world even if not intended.
1342568650532777984 2020-12-26 04:31:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SexCounseling That’s quite a lot of votes. You would think the powers that be would want to correct this.
1342568054945767425 2020-12-26 04:29:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @whatgives1313 Tosser doesn’t even cut it.
1342457321318838272 2020-12-25 21:09:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust Hollywood is no longer relevant. Too busy with the pc &amp; telling people how to think is not popular with the thinking public.
1342304952354410496 2020-12-25 11:03:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LadyRedWave You are not alone. It is just very unfunny &amp; weird.
1342304473163517952 2020-12-25 11:01:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Peter217945 We have the beautiful magpies in south Australia.

1342295939885613057 2020-12-25 10:27:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @theonlyrymac Here’s hoping Santa left you a potato.
1342295419980693504 2020-12-25 10:25:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @heatherjones333 Merry Christmas.
1342295104002768896 2020-12-25 10:24:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @catturd2 I actually find the dr very disturbing. I don’t know why but I don’t believe anything he says.
1342293241169731584 2020-12-25 10:17:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @djboz52 @rowandean And a few hot days does not cause panic &amp; mean there is drastic warming.
1342292870988849154 2020-12-25 10:15:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @rowandean Glad you are still keeping us to date with the weather forecasts. Good to hear the truth. Have a great Christmas.

1342239444460433408 2020-12-25 06:43:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @reubing @BoozNTattoos Wow I thought he was at least 90.
1342236064627343361 2020-12-25 06:29:50 +0800 <bluesjack42> @jimx2460 I wish someone would take Rudd’s phone away. He is what Biden calls people a one horse pony corn pop.

1342231641108836352 2020-12-25 06:12:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ChrisMo37540912 Probably written &amp; added to everyday by people with their little pet projects.
1342231110349070336 2020-12-25 06:10:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JWSpry @RogTallbloke Definitely ffs.
1342223818194997248 2020-12-25 05:41:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BreitbartNews You are an embarrassment ,trump wanted what I’m sure most Americans in strife wanted. A bill for stimulus for Americans only. All the other things the dems wanted could have been voted on a separate bill.
1342214512502403073 2020-12-25 05:04:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Mrtdogg Omg.

1342001227958079490 2020-12-24 14:56:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @amyklobuchar So who is that??? It can’t be someone with dementia.
1342000198818488320 2020-12-24 14:52:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @newsmax Stupid stupid.
1341986151612043266 2020-12-24 13:56:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @newsmax Such a violent person. I’d like to see her try.

1341956614887129089 2020-12-24 11:59:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PoliBard I find anyone who risks people’s lives &amp; while admitting responsibility actually does not take responsibility, very offensive.

1341953747572805633 2020-12-24 11:48:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Jim_Jordan Merry Christmas to you Jim &amp; thanks from Australia for supporting president Trump.
1341938307752587265 2020-12-24 10:46:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Tim_jbo @RealMarkLatham That was a great speech by Latham.
1341929323670851584 2020-12-24 10:10:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @barmore27 He is obsessed with ponies. Very weird.
1341928881536692225 2020-12-24 10:09:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BeverleyMaxwe15 @Tony__Heller Who would have thought? Actually I thought that but I didn’t have interests in the climate fiasco.
1341928480754159616 2020-12-24 10:07:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SexCounseling I think he was just convenient &amp; bought &amp; paid for.
1341927946907348992 2020-12-24 10:05:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Gebbs84 Boy he is a bit of fool.
1341925570993524736 2020-12-24 09:56:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @disclosetv Thank goodness
1341876012762558464 2020-12-24 06:39:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SexCounseling If these states have certified without investigation I believe it can then be classed a criminal act.
1341874929722015747 2020-12-24 06:34:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DanielAndrewsMP What a load of bollocks. Australians don’t have to be told to be nice to shopkeepers by someone who lost 800 lives through incompetence &amp; justice will not be given to those people &amp; their families.
1341842956186046464 2020-12-24 04:27:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JackPosobiec Maybe just wishful thinking then.
1341839575799324673 2020-12-24 04:14:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BreitbartNews I have already boycotted  Clooney from my viewing list.
1341729850030112774 2020-12-23 20:58:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @disclosetv We are not in a climate emergency.
1341637551040262144 2020-12-23 14:51:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Peter217945 I like Alfred better than the other one.
1341621637712527361 2020-12-23 13:48:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealBrysonGray @TheRISEofROD It’s simple it is a stimulus bill for the American people who have been adversely affected by the virus. Not for foreign countries problems or arty farts projects of the likes of pelosi. Just saying as I see it &amp; im sure most of the people suffering.
1341619569325064198 2020-12-23 13:40:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Tim_jbo About time.
1341550858085928962 2020-12-23 09:07:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DailyCaller Platitude Biden again.
1341549681709477889 2020-12-23 09:02:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @jaco_wacko Anyone who puts tattoos on their face, really.
1341549326103760897 2020-12-23 09:00:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Hoosiers1986 @realDonaldTrump I think we the public are beginning to realize a lot of things about all our leaders &amp; politics in general. And none of it good.
1341548263732756480 2020-12-23 08:56:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @luisbaram No surprise there.
1341547310568763392 2020-12-23 08:52:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PoliBard Agree. It’s utter nonsense.
1341547170873282560 2020-12-23 08:52:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @markbjardine @eduneret Exactly how does money change their laws???
1341546922188816386 2020-12-23 08:51:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @eduneret Why does Pakistan need money to change their laws about their treatment of women?
1341540623682162688 2020-12-23 08:26:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Hoosiers1986 @JoeBiden Dead heat.
1341540331775381507 2020-12-23 08:25:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @disclosetv Hope that’s true.
1341539167122018304 2020-12-23 08:20:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BreitbartNews @markbjardine That is exactly the problem. Changing the course of USA is not a good thing if run by communism.
1341532036935213056 2020-12-23 07:52:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @stevoB59 @BawdenSnoek The whole trouble with Victoria seems to be no good opposition.

1341530902317342722 2020-12-23 07:47:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BreitbartNews S#o what has happened to all the threats you made a few months ago.
1341530658020028416 2020-12-23 07:46:47 +0800 <bluesjack42> @jkalbrechtsen Merry Christmas.
1341530115717562368 2020-12-23 07:44:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Turdface70 I will make sure I say merry Christmas.
1341490307414646784 2020-12-23 05:06:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DailyCaller What is it with him &amp; ponies? There will be a sanitized investigation &amp; then nothing to see here. There is no law &amp; order in USA anymore.
1341481957201301504 2020-12-23 04:33:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @themary21 Just can’t pick one.
1341357989454757888 2020-12-22 20:20:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @senatemajldr Turncoat.
1341147603757539328 2020-12-22 06:24:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Chantarelle2009 @DailyCaller Overseas.
1341147134653915138 2020-12-22 06:22:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DailyCaller No 600 is not significant.
1341146275966640128 2020-12-22 06:19:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RepRalphNorman I hope they check the fine print.
1341145837208911873 2020-12-22 06:17:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HLiedown But sick but I couldn’t help laughing.
1341145469376860160 2020-12-22 06:16:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AnimalsWorId Animals are smarter than most people.
1341142980350988288 2020-12-22 06:06:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @dbongino This is a woman who didn’t think it inappropriate to brag about her ice cream while people were struggling to put food on the table. She is disgusting.
1341140359150096384 2020-12-22 05:55:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @NatalieJHarp @CDW83828995 @RudyGiuliani People destroy things when classed as evidence &amp; they are guilty of a crime.
1341002362735890433 2020-12-21 20:47:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden Sounds like a threat.
1340926898054942720 2020-12-21 15:47:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RodMin5 @mpsmithnews @DanielAndrewsMP Who doesn’t believe Andrews would have made the final decision is crazy.
1340926422529921024 2020-12-21 15:45:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews Someone made a decision ffs.
1340873216194048000 2020-12-21 12:14:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @christ7613 @baalter Obviously can’t add up.
1340813620645490688 2020-12-21 08:17:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @gatewaypundit @joehoft We actually watched the election in Australia. I will not dispute the fact that influx of Biden only votes flooded in towards the end , which definitely needs investigating &amp; considered by the courts.  Why would you not want to know the election was legal &amp; not compromised.
1340807895131123712 2020-12-21 07:54:47 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust I think we know that it had to be the top dog.
1340806333054906369 2020-12-21 07:48:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @senatemajldr You think this will make a difference. What would make a difference is you supporting the president.
1340795471506247681 2020-12-21 07:05:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ambjenkinsjones Lol.
1340786914765369344 2020-12-21 06:31:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MTGoldblum @gatewaypundit Great idea.
1340786358130933761 2020-12-21 06:29:13 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealMattCouch I am not a Christian but I consider myself a good person. I also defend your rights as Christians. I also support president trump.
1340781563785560065 2020-12-21 06:10:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @buitengebieden_ Just takes one strong leader.
1340772788961853440 2020-12-21 05:35:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RitaPanahi @HbAlpaca Thank goodness.
1340772625493053440 2020-12-21 05:34:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Laszlo76247344 @bohme_martin @JennaEllisEsq @TeamTrump The election needs to be investigated properly &amp; whistleblowers need to be listened to. You can’t let threats interfere with an election.
1340772012029972485 2020-12-21 05:32:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HbAlpaca @latingle Lies lies lies.
1340771332154302464 2020-12-21 05:29:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ezralevant This is heartbreaking. What is wrong with the world??
1340769348630147073 2020-12-21 05:21:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @georgebarnes311 @kfisme Another off the list.
1340768043241066497 2020-12-21 05:16:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrAndyNgo This is the evil world we are living in now. It will only get worse.
1340764181948067840 2020-12-21 05:01:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden Sorry mate you are too far down the road of dementia.
1340748765758558208 2020-12-21 03:59:50 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LuanaGoriss Yes a short ass .
1340514405214121985 2020-12-20 12:28:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MBalsich We didn’t but there you go. Farce.
1340492655780790277 2020-12-20 11:02:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PoliBard Equally annoying.
1340492352884916225 2020-12-20 11:00:56 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews Well that means that trump is doing the right thing. Green wouldn’t know .....
1340490524084457474 2020-12-20 10:53:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore You only pardon someone if you know they are guilty of something. So by default he knows his son is guilty.
1340488385400504320 2020-12-20 10:45:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JennaEllisEsq The whole point is why wouldn’t anyone want to know if there was fraud committed in this election. It is just so wrong not to allow an investigation.
1340486551424286721 2020-12-20 10:37:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump I am not sure bc it’s been a horrible year in some ways. Let’s hope honesty &amp; fairness prevail.
1340461049741381632 2020-12-20 08:56:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @buntz3 @AtomicPunk57 Tweet of the day.
1340460721860005889 2020-12-20 08:55:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ezralevant @RestaurantsCA Brilliant idea.

1340459623799668737 2020-12-20 08:50:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @catherine___c The left are always furious at something. They need to look in their own backyards.
1340451658308861955 2020-12-20 08:19:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @_evelynrae Same here.
1340451327357247488 2020-12-20 08:17:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DonnaWR8 Wow. What is wrong with her??
1340450628670124034 2020-12-20 08:15:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Hoosiers1986 There probably is in the swamp of politics but they are definitely near the top of the list.
1340424463997829120 2020-12-20 06:31:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @WildforestSue @Reuters I don’t.
1340424374269067265 2020-12-20 06:30:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Reuters That will be banned in our house.
1340421962716258304 2020-12-20 06:21:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @____Boone____ @catturd2 If she cared for him she wouldn’t put him through this farce.
1340421733237497856 2020-12-20 06:20:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @catturd2 She is his career. She is a dr don’t you know. Lol.
1340421368710459393 2020-12-20 06:18:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @barmore27 Always. I will remember when USA had a president who could not be bought &amp; truly loved the USA.
1340416159590408193 2020-12-20 05:58:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @nypost These people are just racist &amp; ageist.
1340411607931707392 2020-12-20 05:40:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @charliekirk11 She sounds nice like the rest of the Bidens.
1340408649995309056 2020-12-20 05:28:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ParamjitGarewal I feel a bit sorry for the one who married Soros. Money isn’t everything.
1340400864930906113 2020-12-20 04:57:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Agree. I feel Australia will be in more danger if trump loses &amp; Biden who is controlled by China, will be president.
1340398455500357633 2020-12-20 04:47:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @zerohedge Who can afford electric vehicles ?

1340098307066974210 2020-12-19 08:55:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Bubblebathgirl @BevPerth Will they? Probably not unless they are instructed by the dems.
1340067543491309568 2020-12-19 06:52:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @charliekirk11 Depends whose life it is. Criminals will always get guns.
1340060837772316673 2020-12-19 06:26:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @dbongino He said nothing but platitudes again.

1339913403066793984 2020-12-18 20:40:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews What is he talking about??
1339848473168920579 2020-12-18 16:22:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KeiraSavage00 Their leaders wouldn’t care probably. As long as they have power.

1339751756910059521 2020-12-18 09:58:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DailyCaller I don’t think taking drugs is very smart. Also leaving a money trail from China not smart. Leaving a compromised laptop at the computer shop definitely not smart. I’m sure we will uncover other not very smart things from his past. Just saying.
1339741080149880833 2020-12-18 09:15:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JackPosobiec Sounds logical.
1339731379534196736 2020-12-18 08:37:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HowardMortman Just saying but screaming does not seem very justice like. Surely this should be decided on the law, not bc they are scared of retaliation from violent lefty groups.
1339730449078181889 2020-12-18 08:33:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ThAlMeArCrEq @ScottPresler From both sides.
1339730312310362112 2020-12-18 08:32:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ScottPresler @17AmericanTruth Amazing. After all this bs they finally think that checking signatures is necessary. Sorry but America has such a third world election.
1339729702353731585 2020-12-18 08:30:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AtomicPunk57 I think I’m on my second but I am old.

1339715549819912193 2020-12-18 07:34:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SexCounseling Apparently not.
1339715221158445057 2020-12-18 07:32:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Lrihendry Maybe forced to.
1339704408943198208 2020-12-18 06:49:56 +0800 <bluesjack42> @charliekirk11 This is appalling. That family should sue the airline.

Many scientists &amp; normal everyday people do not believe or support what the left &amp; people with interest in the lucrative renewable industry are promoting.

1339676810464776192 2020-12-18 05:00:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @826Maureen I don’t think visiting will make any difference unless they guarantee jobs in mining etc.

1337300477063487489 2020-12-11 15:37:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JackPosobiec @BeanK511 I will never forget Benghazi.
1337300089300164609 2020-12-11 15:36:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LATAMforTRUMP @TrumpLadyFran @realDonaldTrump @jjauthor @Lrihendry @EricTrump @AmyKremer @BrandonStraka @SaraCarterDC @kayleighmcenany @AppSame This is what some don’t understand. People voted in all honesty but the system threw out their votes or flipped them to Biden apparently, there is too evidence not to change the result.
1337299124345978880 2020-12-11 15:32:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MaxPleming @catherine___c Nothing wrong with potatoes.
1337298909979267073 2020-12-11 15:31:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @catherine___c Ridiculous. They have done nothing &amp; hopefully will do nothing. Mind you they fit in with many of previous people of the year eg hitler.
1337298078286528518 2020-12-11 15:28:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AusAntiLeft I hope not. The election was was fraudulent in my opinion.
1337196289700757504 2020-12-11 08:43:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore Please
1337196120938713089 2020-12-11 08:42:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MiloForSenate My finger would get cramp from typing the list. Just say most of the dems.
1337193638737035264 2020-12-11 08:33:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @826Maureen Insane. Maybe this is to control the masses.
1337142940976570368 2020-12-11 05:11:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @lizcabrera55 @JanMareeSmith2 What is wrong with these democrats!
1337142011460079616 2020-12-11 05:07:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mkraju If you struggle &amp; many others don’t maybe you should look at yourself.
1337136084145213441 2020-12-11 04:44:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @InnesKay @SkyNewsAust Surely not. No one likes her.
1337021433197826048 2020-12-10 21:08:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden Does he have any other policies apart from masks.???
1337019817258143746 2020-12-10 21:02:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Thomas1774Paine This pandemic &amp; its pain it’s caused is not funny &amp; these 2 clowns are not either.
1336924779186515971 2020-12-10 14:44:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mladybug7301 @EvanAKilgore The proof has been shown. Affidavits have been submitted.
1336924268836352000 2020-12-10 14:42:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore The absolute confidence they had thinking they would get away with this. Not one type of fraud but multiple ways. This has to be investigated properly &amp; people need to go to jail.
1336923714718294016 2020-12-10 14:40:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore Sounds like fraud to me. Interesting to hear what excuse will be given.
1336838890200518656 2020-12-10 09:03:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MarkYoungTruth I don’t know about anyone else but I just don’t like this person.
1336837279726235648 2020-12-10 08:56:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @826Maureen Maybe bc most flights from overseas seem to go straight to Sydney.
1336836203568537600 2020-12-10 08:52:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Turdface70 I’m on it.
1336834593572319232 2020-12-10 08:46:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MatthewJshow @realDonaldTrump Same here in Australia. Knew something was wrong.
1336830602536882176 2020-12-10 08:30:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KamVTV Wow you wouldn’t think this was necessary.
1336830303671701504 2020-12-10 08:29:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ellymelly Not to mention wind farms that provide minuscule amount of power.
1336829137915244544 2020-12-10 08:24:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @OMGTheMess There is nothing normal in that person’s mind.
1336828721328574465 2020-12-10 08:22:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @1Swinging_Voter @SullJack48 Ridiculous. People will no longer be able to just work grape picking or casual work to bump up their pensions. These people don’t live in the real world.
1336800071212417024 2020-12-10 06:29:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @disclosetv @FredGeorg2 The Vatican should stick to religious matters in my opinion.
1336799066219409408 2020-12-10 06:25:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mitchsnyder45 @EinsteinsMagic Maybe the hunter taxes investigation is a red herring. They will investigate, say nothing to see here whereas the Ukraine &amp; laptop  investigation is swept under the carpet. Just saying.
1336797301826703361 2020-12-10 06:18:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MPSWandsworth @metpoliceuk So scary hope he is ok.
1336788246949314560 2020-12-10 05:42:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @GhostOf177Six @Annakhait Wow.
1336652225347633154 2020-12-09 20:41:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LuanaGoriss Not yet.
1336651513230368769 2020-12-09 20:38:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BawdenSnoek Completely insane. No wonder the world is going down the toilet.
1336650369674272768 2020-12-09 20:34:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @826Maureen @woolworths Won’t be buying those again.
1336539443805577217 2020-12-09 13:13:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @bennyjohnson Why not? Greg is great.
1336538559365279744 2020-12-09 13:09:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @gatewaypundit @newsmax @gregkellyusa Good he is very likable.
1336514485675204608 2020-12-09 11:34:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Beth_Alize Totally rude.
1336508177974611969 2020-12-09 11:09:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SanaSaeed This is for John Lennon. Said while punching out an American.
1336506987295567877 2020-12-09 11:04:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @marklutchman I am not rushing into it.
1336506764477415424 2020-12-09 11:03:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @bette_oh Why not?? He is probably not the only one.
1336476962030637056 2020-12-09 09:05:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BobeMannBball Is a right wing fascists (so called) someone who is conservative who disagrees with far left socialists, but doesn’t go on looting , violence &amp; destroying. Are we now living in a society where only one side of politics is allowed.
1336472066971746304 2020-12-09 08:45:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrMichaelBurkes Hoping. Fingers crossed.
1336464658769723394 2020-12-09 08:16:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DineshDSouza How can this man be president? Not fair on him or the country.
1336462878207926272 2020-12-09 08:09:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mwam1993 I had a shower when I came out all these states had joined the cause.
1336461425611395072 2020-12-09 08:03:28 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AppleTV @BarackObama @Oprah Care factor. Zilch.
1336460721719181312 2020-12-09 08:00:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @adavo1963 @ScottAdamsSays Evil.
1336460517016145920 2020-12-09 07:59:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ScottAdamsSays There is video of Biden bragging he would hold money for Ukraine unless they sacked someone. Apparently they did sack an official, they did get the money &amp; hunter was not investigated &amp; still hasn’t been.
1336459679401033728 2020-12-09 07:56:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HankMeyerNAPP Nobody can explain bc it’s beyond common dense.
1336443489802833925 2020-12-09 06:52:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @whatgives1313 @SpeakerPelosi No I think she wins the prize.
1336439125411463168 2020-12-09 06:34:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ppv_tahoe @WendyThePooh63 @dougducey @SecretaryHobbs @GeneralBrnovich We were watching in Australia in real time which was all day. We saw what happened.
1336431988534722560 2020-12-09 06:06:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DonnaWR8 The trouble is now that I think people in countries like USA will no longer trust elections to be legal. Most people can see obvious fraud taking place even if it is not acknowledged by the courts. It is a complete mess.
1336426732069384195 2020-12-09 05:45:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Annakhait I will wait &amp; see.
1336425916193337344 2020-12-09 05:42:22 +0800 <bluesjack42> @marklutchman He looks edgy &amp; nervous.
1336417146620919808 2020-12-09 05:07:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Hoosiers1986 @realDonaldTrump Well he doesn’t do it for money as he doesn’t even take any,. He obviously loves USA .
1336291949087608832 2020-12-08 20:50:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @burrosavic I don’t. Just can’t stand hearing unprecedented hot temps, rainfall unprecedented &amp; all the other never happened before weather. Just check my phone in the morning &amp; go outside.
1336230874552025088 2020-12-08 16:47:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @shanermurph @MrAndyNgo She needs counseling.
1336230731203276801 2020-12-08 16:46:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrAndyNgo This person should be kept away from the classroom &amp; children. No self control,
1336229947728306176 2020-12-08 16:43:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @demongrrl51 Waiting for the warming.
1336118046570598400 2020-12-08 09:19:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ScottAdamsSays I think both sides are agreeing she is quite horrible.
1336065574909005824 2020-12-08 05:50:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KatieDaviscourt Must be so proud to know her hysteria is witnessed all over the world.
1336065078748037122 2020-12-08 05:48:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KatieDaviscourt Yes I guess teachers still get paid working or not.
1336061548012290048 2020-12-08 05:34:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealMattCouch Don’t know but he looks edgy &amp; nervous.
1336057694092836864 2020-12-08 05:19:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DailyCaller Yes  you are both   like De Niro . Completely nuts .
1336055974931525632 2020-12-08 05:12:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BootheyJeff Always has been.
1335870533490016257 2020-12-07 16:55:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Vintagedrummer7 I don’t know how this person can live with himself??

1335749319266164736 2020-12-07 08:53:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Vintagedrummer7 Cold rainy day in south Australia.
1335748578308853760 2020-12-07 08:50:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LawyersCity So funny.
1335746494960300032 2020-12-07 08:42:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LLinWood @red_red_rita @sendavidperdue Be a strong person &amp; support the president &amp; the voters who had their votes invalidated by this scam of an election.
1335743229552021504 2020-12-07 08:29:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DailyCaller Love him.
1335740962736283648 2020-12-07 08:20:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BreitbartNews It didn’t need widespread apparently just in the states that counted.
1335739928542552065 2020-12-07 08:16:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Thomas1774Paine Oh those serious faces.

1335724780096372736 2020-12-07 07:16:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AlanEdw58236339 Why not do both?
1335724463032168448 2020-12-07 07:15:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Turdface70 Still watching channel 7 I see. I guess someone has to do it.
1335717182290894849 2020-12-07 06:46:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @catturd2 Even worse bc he pretends he is not.
1335645672410738688 2020-12-07 02:01:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AusAntiLeft No
1335440993227661313 2020-12-06 12:28:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @sofka_juyne @BevPerth He looks his age.
1335439244211355648 2020-12-06 12:21:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @IsItTimeForA @catturd2 @Stello_Official I just think Biden is a weirdo. Not his fault if he has dementia, but to be president of USA is ridiculous.
1335438055805599747 2020-12-06 12:16:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @catturd2 Too much detail. Didn’t need to know. Just say you tripped over the dog.
1335436292331503618 2020-12-06 12:09:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AOC You just don’t get it.
1335420880508264449 2020-12-06 11:08:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @WingTrending @DepFred_Kares Is it too late to impeach Obama?? Asking for a friend.
1335419679091789825 2020-12-06 11:03:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EinsteinsMagic @cjones4334 I know how it feels.
1335418581220126721 2020-12-06 10:59:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @OMGTheMess Good question.
1335418363942633472 2020-12-06 10:58:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Hoosiers1986 @realDonaldTrump I reckon if you had a dinner party &amp; invited trump it would be so interesting.
1335374234718150658 2020-12-06 08:03:22 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Hoosiers1986 Don’t know if it is on purpose but it is what is happening regardless.
1335366250453614595 2020-12-06 07:31:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Jersey_Joe1206 Fair enough
1335347345563631617 2020-12-06 06:16:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Pete_Howarth333 @debostic There are many women who are bravely signing affidavits under oath, about voter fraud they claim to have witnessed. Why are these men &amp; women not being believed?
1335346387114856448 2020-12-06 06:12:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @debostic Just curious, what evidence would be acceptable for proving fraud?
1335336927738830848 2020-12-06 05:35:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RyanAFournier McConaughey appears to be a thoughtful person who is also a great actor.
1335335263774461952 2020-12-06 05:28:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RN7JB @barmore27 Maybe put gretas carbon emissions against mine or many ordinary people just trying to live a normal family life.
1335334681110179840 2020-12-06 05:26:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SilkSunflowers @ouchinagirl There are many people in America who seem to be victimized or threatened for telling the truth bc it doesn’t fit the narrative.
1335333476107579392 2020-12-06 05:21:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RyanAFournier @MAGAlover99 I can’t believe that affidavits signed under oath are not being listened too. These people are trying to stand up for voters who could have voted legally but their votes will not mean a thing.
1335200182820958208 2020-12-05 20:31:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DLoesch @jeanmc919 That woman is evil.

1335079509024858113 2020-12-05 12:32:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @namotuman @plbrocks @gatewaypundit I hope someone is protecting her. She could be in danger.
1335079232783806464 2020-12-05 12:31:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Cernovich @BeanK511 The trouble is it will probably be the little people in this potentially massive fraud who will go to jail or be eliminated. The elites &amp; the people up the top of the food chain always seem to escape.
1335073723922014208 2020-12-05 12:09:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BeholdIsrael He has the will of the people who are not lefty.
1335073349903388673 2020-12-05 12:07:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Peter217945 Sick sick sick. But typical Hollywood.
1335069181914488834 2020-12-05 11:51:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @catherine___c Sarcasm I guess.
1335068662693130241 2020-12-05 11:49:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ChuckCallesto I would actually like to see Barr do something
1335062718257061888 2020-12-05 11:25:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @suzydymna @TheRISEofROD @PhillDKline Yes they could call it the FBI. It could be unbiased, work for the people, wouldn’t that be good.
1335010223631699970 2020-12-05 07:56:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ChuckCallesto @Gregory52594205 About time.
1335009937521401856 2020-12-05 07:55:47 +0800 <bluesjack42> @bbtoots He is a bit short. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, just the rest of him that is not quite right.
1335005420109266944 2020-12-05 07:37:50 +0800 <bluesjack42> @theangiestanton She needs protection now.
1335000055707660288 2020-12-05 07:16:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @realDonaldTrump I don’t dispute it because we have not investigated it throughly. There are so many signed affidavits under oath that should be considered before we talk about disputing. I think the truth needs to come out either way.
1334990361140232193 2020-12-05 06:37:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @newscomauHQ Vomit.
1334988682923659264 2020-12-05 06:31:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TheBabylonBee @eavesdropann Easily done. Very funny based on truth.
1334975831949512704 2020-12-05 05:40:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @StrawsForAll @ouchinagirl The problem for the dems is that there seems to be a lot of people involved in this alleged crime of voter fraud that it seems unlikely that the truth will not be revealed. It’s like the house of cards.
1334974709968982016 2020-12-05 05:35:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KillAuDeepState @VickiMerivale I think it should happen.
1334973074416959490 2020-12-05 05:29:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @thebias_news @StrategicMelis I no longer believe in accidents. Just saying.
1334972526775037952 2020-12-05 05:27:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TeamTrump @SlimKAG @Mike_Pence About time.
1334970893576019968 2020-12-05 05:20:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HerschelWalker This getting so obvious that the courts have to start convicting for election fraud.
1334969142298873857 2020-12-05 05:13:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kayleighmcenany The trouble with having a president elect with dementia is they are too truthful. They have lost the plot literally.
1334967748665851908 2020-12-05 05:08:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealMattCouch So weird. But then he is so weird.
1334967309903953920 2020-12-05 05:06:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrMichaelBurkes Yes.
1334820419560300545 2020-12-04 19:22:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DailyCaller This person wants to be president???
1334819209331634176 2020-12-04 19:17:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @piepaulie He just looks weak.
1334817822300536833 2020-12-04 19:12:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Thomas1774Paine I think that’s the wrong way round.
1334720644513054720 2020-12-04 12:46:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ADM0107 @jsolomonReports I have nightmares about what happened in Benghazi &amp; I’m Australian. We should never forgive or forget.
1334718623164760064 2020-12-04 12:38:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @imnotleft @markbjardine I was when I saw how confident the Biden team were. They didn’t try to hide the fact they they had it fixed.
1334634881830154241 2020-12-04 07:05:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HyeinK1m @TheRISEofROD So heartbreaking.
1334626816904982529 2020-12-04 06:33:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Thomas1774Paine I guess he fits the profile of candidates for time person of the year.
1334610087889887234 2020-12-04 05:26:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DebRoskamp @TeamTrump @OANN Watched it in Australia. Different time zones so yes we watched the whole jump of Biden votes in real time.
1334609122637967360 2020-12-04 05:23:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TeamTrump I think that could be the proof Barr needs.
1334603221571026946 2020-12-04 04:59:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @theangiestanton Sounds pretty straightforward. These claims need to be investigated.
1334600209209249792 2020-12-04 04:47:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KelemenCari Simple maths backed up by video, whistle blowers.
1334490355673120770 2020-12-03 21:31:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @newsmax @CDW83828995 That means actually doing something.
1334485252668936193 2020-12-03 21:10:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ari_russian @CDW83828995 @SidneyPowell1 @KelemenCari @realDonaldTrump They can but they are basically denying it even though the evidence is there.
1334482246372184066 2020-12-03 20:58:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @byrdlawpa @realCarone_ Wow.
1334481398132953088 2020-12-03 20:55:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @btysonmd Amazing that could have been given to many patients if only trump had not mentioned it.
1334480433342423043 2020-12-03 20:51:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @catturd2 Probably.
1334480274453721094 2020-12-03 20:51:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @christina_bobb That was the most disgusting, ignorant display of intimidation.
1334478198080303105 2020-12-03 20:42:50 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Enchant93108850 @christina_bobb @OANN That intimidation was disgusting.
1334376084263976961 2020-12-03 13:57:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @michaelbeatty3 I’m sorry but how are these people in any position of power???
1334363232421650433 2020-12-03 13:06:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @purdyme4u @michaelbeatty3 That was when Harry was fun &amp; normal.
1334362560921931778 2020-12-03 13:03:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @michaelbeatty3 Are these people roe real.
1334360355837886464 2020-12-03 12:54:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @charliekirk11 FA your honor.
1334330226113822720 2020-12-03 10:54:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @willchamberlain So what??
1334328440380481537 2020-12-03 10:47:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @tomiahonen Charming uneducated twat.
1334113218319433728 2020-12-02 20:32:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Tim_jbo The most annoying word ever. It means the exact opposite usually.
1333965103729831938 2020-12-02 10:43:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @gatewaypundit These republicans who are not fighting for the Americans whose votes were not counted should be ashamed.
1333963023652777985 2020-12-02 10:35:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JGademski Exactly where will our reliable power source come from. Very scary &amp; so unnecessary.
1333962507522740230 2020-12-02 10:33:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust Must be global warming.
1333647604333178883 2020-12-01 13:42:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @realDailyWire Really mind your own business.
1333646462182334466 2020-12-01 13:37:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust @AngusTaylorMP Sorry mate but you can’t do both.
1333590215567392773 2020-12-01 09:54:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TrumpRulzz Sounds very suspicious to say the least. Sarcasm .
1333398734734991360 2020-11-30 21:13:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @GiantMTB_275 @AusAntiLeft He should never have gone into politics. Although I didn’t like him much before.
1333393488956727297 2020-11-30 20:52:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SenatorWong Not a fan of penny wong but that was well said.
1333350066044563456 2020-11-30 18:00:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HbAlpaca What complete rubbish.
1333275846337908736 2020-11-30 13:05:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AngusTaylorMP Sorry don’t really care unless it means we don’t have to sign up for anymore targets set by countries who don’t follow the same rules.
1333271051132751873 2020-11-30 12:46:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @rossf500 @KeiraSavage00 I am willing to drink more wine.
1333270830449446912 2020-11-30 12:45:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KeiraSavage00 It is just starting.
1333269548783398912 2020-11-30 12:40:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden People who cheat , lie&amp; threaten with violence are not friends.
1333173068504596481 2020-11-30 06:16:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeConchaTV So he won’t be asked any tricky questions from the so called reporters.
1333162679091937282 2020-11-30 05:35:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PerspicaciousXY @Jamierodr14 I wish we didn’t have to hear these pathetic platitudes from people who have no idea what normal everyday people are going through.
1333150307312836610 2020-11-30 04:46:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Thomas1774Paine This person needs locking up. Promoting &amp; supporting violence.
1333020889810571264 2020-11-29 20:12:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Usatorz1 @HyltonRobin We were watching in real time in Australia. It looked very odd.
1332918924573229061 2020-11-29 13:26:50 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mamastitch75 @iheartmindy Definitely.
1332908429657075713 2020-11-29 12:45:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Kate18660449 Rules rules. Ridiculous bs.
1332871020257058816 2020-11-29 10:16:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Vintagedrummer7 I will remember 2020 as the year  we overreacted on the climate, the virus &amp; USA took the first steps towards the great reset &amp; communism.
1332870204230041601 2020-11-29 10:13:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AusAntiLeft @AtomicPunk57 How odd. Sounds a bit like fraud to me.
1332869430347403267 2020-11-29 10:10:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kyserdk_k @EricMMatheny Or a compromising photo maybe.
1332869307554951168 2020-11-29 10:09:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @jmdaidone @EricMMatheny Does to me. Maybe that’s why Epstein was eliminated about 6 months later.
1332867204870676480 2020-11-29 10:01:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @italianmom555 @EricMMatheny @TheOnlooker18 Or words to that affect.
1332866947025838081 2020-11-29 10:00:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EricMMatheny @SullJack48 The swamp were shocked.
1332866295994322944 2020-11-29 09:57:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @rockyruin @catherine___c Disgusting behavior, but typical.
1332865080061431808 2020-11-29 09:52:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden @JoeFreedomLove Anymore cliches, platitudes from joe’s minders?
1332864658655432706 2020-11-29 09:51:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust How can you say record breaking when it’s not. Apparently 40 years ago it was hotter.
1332864170031599616 2020-11-29 09:49:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealTina40 Not very PC but fair enough.
1332863180083585028 2020-11-29 09:45:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AusAntiLeft He has the ears for it.
1332862895026176001 2020-11-29 09:44:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DCoory No just 2 lefty wannabes.
1332834898244059139 2020-11-29 07:52:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JWSpry How can this false prophet of climate change be in charge of anything to do with climate or weather.???
1332834033328275457 2020-11-29 07:49:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @oranglaut I agree. I’m trying but it they are a bit clunky.
1332831171705638912 2020-11-29 07:38:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @WondaSa08762447 @whatgives1313 The good old days of honest elections.
1332831053929533440 2020-11-29 07:37:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @whatgives1313 I am beginning to think there might have been fraud in previous elections. Who would know???
1332829388044308482 2020-11-29 07:31:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden Show me a communist country that allows or encourages that. Platitudes from the Biden group once again.
1332815835832799232 2020-11-29 06:37:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SydneyLWatson Great analogy.
1332815130338283520 2020-11-29 06:34:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @WatchChad I think she is cruel letting her husband be set up for failure.
1332813921103712257 2020-11-29 06:29:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MillyMolly300 Insane.
1332813602663714816 2020-11-29 06:28:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @catherine___c We are Australians we know it’s hot. We know what to do.
1332813044787802114 2020-11-29 06:26:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MiloForSenate Great movie.
1332812130307850240 2020-11-29 06:22:28 +0800 <bluesjack42> @whatgives1313 How can we trust them to run the country when they couldn’t run an election fraud properly.
1332811447441584128 2020-11-29 06:19:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @bette_oh Another sign of his mental decline maybe.
1332808523164512256 2020-11-29 06:08:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Metaporia @redruby17 That must be on their repeated playlist. It always happens when we are hunting through the little metal fixings.
1332807862184153088 2020-11-29 06:05:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @redruby17 Should be. We usually end up with that extra pack of batteries or a mossie coil.
1332801013120602112 2020-11-29 05:38:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TheFlatEartherr @NONONOEU Does unconstitutional mean illegal?? I prefer the term illegal.
1332800273249685506 2020-11-29 05:35:22 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ezralevant I think we have to look at who is running the police.
1332799624105451521 2020-11-29 05:32:47 +0800 <bluesjack42> @bette_oh I watched a bio pic of Biden over the last 40yrs. He plagiarized, he used racist comments &amp; in fact just went with everything he pretends to be against now. He is a career politician basically.
1332797465033121797 2020-11-29 05:24:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EricTrump I am beginning to realize they didn’t let Biden campaign much bc he is suffering from dementia &amp; doesn’t make sense. But the main reason is bc they had the plan to cheat already in the pipeline.
1332785517805457408 2020-11-29 04:36:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @macsween_prue I already do. As a south Australian I usually try to buy SA wine as well.
1332654841168949248 2020-11-28 19:57:28 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Thomas1774Paine He is getting nastier &amp; nastier.
1332652133334675456 2020-11-28 19:46:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kelliekelly23 @yogagenie Always about the money.
1332483693143703555 2020-11-28 08:37:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden Platitudes. His script writers are getting more sooky by the minute.
1332479237090017280 2020-11-28 08:19:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @nypost Well they probably are the sort of people they usually nominate wasn’t hitler chosen a couple of times??
1332478594044477441 2020-11-28 08:17:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @netz_melb Anti social behavior, it’s unchecked violence &amp; needs to be dealt with in the courts harshly.
1332476572998139905 2020-11-28 08:09:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BawdenSnoek Was hunter there ?
1332443588794277888 2020-11-28 05:58:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Reprobate24 @RichHoblyn @johndmtb Shocking yes but anyone with half a brain could have worked that out.
1332440869979340800 2020-11-28 05:47:13 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DailyCaller Will anyone bother to pardon you &amp; your cronies???
1332440122793500672 2020-11-28 05:44:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RodS108443078 Really.He should not have got to the position of PM.  He is a worry.
1332431278558253062 2020-11-28 05:09:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @danwootton @DCTFTW Care factor zero.
1332430091012382720 2020-11-28 05:04:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DailyCaller Bit drastic if true but people are dying in western countries from the affects of lockdowns.
1332426602995535872 2020-11-28 04:50:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JustTheTweets17 Good point.
1332424334091104258 2020-11-28 04:41:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @freenaynow @JanMareeSmith2 Yes.
1332420621544824833 2020-11-28 04:26:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TheFrancescaF They are all complicit then is this fraud.
1332293938619695104 2020-11-27 20:03:22 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Tim_jbo Good.
1332293495617331200 2020-11-27 20:01:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @paigecardona Ok maybe for you apparently but some people died alone in nursing homes. There were too many deaths in Victoria.
1332292037136109568 2020-11-27 19:55:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JanMareeSmith2 I hope you are right.
1332288188925104128 2020-11-27 19:40:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AlanEdw58236339 It’s normal in Australia to have hot days.
1332247530357198848 2020-11-27 16:58:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @thegenuinefitz @spartytalkback Sorry can’t help.
1332240419732606976 2020-11-27 16:30:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust Really what a surprise. The usual  Netflix rubbish.
1332240249024434176 2020-11-27 16:30:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KelemenCari Will these people ever stop with their cheating. If only they put a candidate up for election who wasn’t suffering from dementia &amp; a far left communist VP.
1332239547200008194 2020-11-27 16:27:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SueWhitaker11 I hope they are successful. This won’t bring back their son  but it might make the authorities &amp; justice make sure these terrorists are kept in jail.
1332237962566795265 2020-11-27 16:20:56 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Vintagedrummer7 Jane Caro &amp; her cronies are irrelevant to me.
1332159514078941184 2020-11-27 11:09:13 +0800 <bluesjack42> @GeorgiaPine8 @SLapprich Good on him.
1332158833947418625 2020-11-27 11:06:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HbAlpaca He has managed to cause the death of many Victorians through incompetence. So no it’s not easy to do.
1332158448960638976 2020-11-27 11:04:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @GandP007 @AmberX994874 One has dementia &amp; it ain’t trump.
1332157657973620736 2020-11-27 11:01:50 +0800 <bluesjack42> @imbalaska Are they going to ask China &amp; India to follow suit. Not that I think we should.
1332157103461416962 2020-11-27 10:59:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @marklevinshow Really.
1332149946716352512 2020-11-27 10:31:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LightAtTheReady I agree.
1332148410007183361 2020-11-27 10:25:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JohnRuddick2 Always been the same far left, American hating now over the hill so called elite.
1332063025797365760 2020-11-27 04:45:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BarbaraMcK42 @Flashgordonv You voted her back NZ.
1332059390111666177 2020-11-27 04:31:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @9NewsMelb The victim has to live with a lifetime sentence after that attack.
1332057310588375040 2020-11-27 04:23:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @whatgives1313 You can tell she so wanted to be First Lady.
1331940917440258053 2020-11-26 20:40:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Wizard_Predicts These people are evil.
1331935693195493380 2020-11-26 20:19:50 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LifeNewsHQ He is getting worse by the day.
1331917064177479681 2020-11-26 19:05:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SteveSa44424868 I hope these people are brought to justice.
1331916697482133505 2020-11-26 19:04:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Tombx7M @ouchinagirl Typical violence threatened by a terrorist group.
1331916408037335041 2020-11-26 19:03:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @eToro No way would I listen to that person.
1331915477040304129 2020-11-26 18:59:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BeholdIsrael I’m not American either but I’m hoping trump gets another term.
1331914793825890305 2020-11-26 18:56:47 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LaborIsTrash Love to see it.
1331839154619990018 2020-11-26 13:56:13 +0800 <bluesjack42> @armyveteran13 Good on them.
1331791145689509888 2020-11-26 10:45:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SpeakerPelosi How can you even talk about abuse of power???
1331790330664927232 2020-11-26 10:42:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Bernicles1221 @JoeBiden I can’t bear to watch this.
1331789814400598016 2020-11-26 10:40:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @NetworksManager @CNN @FoxNews @ABC @NBCNews Reply to that Biden.
1331789630065164288 2020-11-26 10:39:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden You &amp; your team have created a war against fair elections.
1331725132801265666 2020-11-26 06:23:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DukeSelden @KelemenCari Rubbish. Mathematically impossible. Just because you want a candidate to win you can’t argue with facts.
1331724740902285312 2020-11-26 06:21:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KelemenCari Apart from anything mathematically this is impossible.
1331717693230125058 2020-11-26 05:53:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Turdface70 You are still watching 7?
1331712951061889024 2020-11-26 05:34:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Genesis33K @ATX_PATRIOT Good idea.
1331712283316129794 2020-11-26 05:32:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @FreeKylieMG @DaveSharma So happy for her &amp; her family. But please people learn the lesson to not go to some of these places or at least be very careful.
1331708963402829824 2020-11-26 05:18:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KelemenCari @bette_oh Big surprise.
1331708739536052224 2020-11-26 05:18:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @GideonCRozner She is too nice. Not tough enough.
1331706199897567233 2020-11-26 05:07:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MissHissyKat Thank you.
1331705080312078337 2020-11-26 05:03:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @smh All you have to do Ita is make sure the ABC is unbiased &amp; represents all Australians. At the moment it is not.
1331699623191220226 2020-11-26 04:41:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @WendyThePooh63 @NONONOEU @BeholdIsrael @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump We watched in Australia. Something happened &amp; it was wrong.
1331699080586698752 2020-11-26 04:39:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealMarkLatham @JohnF135 We will no longer have reliable power. Very scary.
1331573539875426307 2020-11-25 20:20:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust @GideonCRozner How do you know unless everything is checked. This people’s votes you are talking about.
1331572758585565184 2020-11-25 20:17:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TrumpLadyFran Could be both of them plus many more.
1331572311938326528 2020-11-25 20:15:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kaitlancollins Why would he talk to those reporters.
1331571307792785408 2020-11-25 20:11:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden The election is far from over. There appears to have been obvious fraud &amp; you should want  to make sure every legal vote is counted but only once, &amp; attributed to the correct candidate. Simple.
1331570051695005696 2020-11-25 20:06:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AusAntiLeft I think it already is. I hope it gets crazy enough to change things.
1331505927812386818 2020-11-25 15:52:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @realTrumpForce Bingo.
1331505775823319041 2020-11-25 15:51:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BawdenSnoek @GreyHaired07 I am an atheist but I would defend the right of Christians to live peacefully.
1331505348713222146 2020-11-25 15:49:47 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden Don’t you mean a puppet for China.
1331504675254800388 2020-11-25 15:47:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Alyssa_Milano How can anyone be in sinc with people who have cheated. Unbelievable.
1331463315466293253 2020-11-25 13:02:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Beth_Alize Wine.
1331463216308764672 2020-11-25 13:02:22 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump No way.
1331351522479800320 2020-11-25 05:38:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @IngrahamAngle He also had a laptop.
1331350346875109376 2020-11-25 05:33:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SpringSteps Maybe bc they don’t want to feel suffocated breathing back in their compromised air, but have to conform to these rules.
1331349593724882946 2020-11-25 05:30:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore Not only.
1331349234872774658 2020-11-25 05:29:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Turdface70 @74PVAN Also sitting in cramped seats exposed to &amp; breathing in all sorts of viruses.
1331334732894720000 2020-11-25 04:31:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AngelWarrior321 @CDW83828995 I say they are either blind or stupid not to acknowledge there was fraud in the election. How can you condone cheating &amp; not want it investigated for the many people who did not have their vote legitimized as is their right. Both sides should want a legal election.
1331332290295721985 2020-11-25 04:22:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @InProportion2 @SConwaySmith @DrREpstein Thank you tucker for reporting the truth.
1331327702616449032 2020-11-25 04:03:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Patriot_Talk_76 @gatewaypundit Threatening the president??
1331320535263821824 2020-11-25 03:35:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CraigAr64 The little platitudes the script writers role out for Biden are really moronic. No substance.
1331089563016593409 2020-11-24 12:17:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MajorPatriot @HyltonRobin You think????
1331088983246323713 2020-11-24 12:15:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Melissa0000017 @aussie_ned Definitely not a fan anymore.
1331088767592009728 2020-11-24 12:14:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @aussie_ned @BeeSting No longer watch Hollywood movies or awards they give themselves. Listening to their self righteous platitudes makes me want to vomit. I would watch if Ricky Gervais was the host though.
1331083015351529477 2020-11-24 11:51:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TeaBoots @eavesdropann Peaceful but effective.
1331081739272273921 2020-11-24 11:46:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore @SidneyPowell1 Yes.
1331070978999283712 2020-11-24 11:03:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @stillgray Do these rhinos ever think of the republican voters whose vote was changed or discarded. I would be furious my vote was tampered with.
1331009054311731200 2020-11-24 06:57:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @gatewaypundit Not to be mean but that person is the health secretary??
1331008715349057536 2020-11-24 06:56:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Turdface70 How can you watch that rubbish?? Although someone has to do it so we don’t.
1330981186341007360 2020-11-24 05:06:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JennaEllisEsq @rentonMagaUK @RealRLimbaugh I just don’t understand why anyone would not want a legal election. Let it be investigated properly with all evidence considered.
1330979318101471232 2020-11-24 04:59:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LadyRedWave Unfortunately this is where we heading.
1330976409401978880 2020-11-24 04:47:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust @ScottMorrisonMP If only that were true. Although if Biden is president, well you know the thing.
1330975811734700033 2020-11-24 04:45:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @nixilaas @Dash35512639 @ItaButtrose I don’t see any Centre just left.
1330975547128594432 2020-11-24 04:44:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @deenie7940 @gatewaypundit On what grounds?
1330975071192580096 2020-11-24 04:42:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @GoalkickingGuru No comment.
1330974656682094592 2020-11-24 04:41:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @christianllamar No way in hell.
1330973838306201600 2020-11-24 04:37:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @bennyjohnson Banning things is now the future.
1330972283607732224 2020-11-24 04:31:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MissHissyKat Surely she did not get all the votes.
1330970966394957824 2020-11-24 04:26:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @twrobertsII @IngrahamAngle It’s called loyalty, something perhaps you lot don’t understand.
1330970768688041984 2020-11-24 04:25:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @IngrahamAngle Nailed it. People like trump because he understands &amp; supports them.
1330969662247505920 2020-11-24 04:21:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @charliekirk11 No surprise. All the elites &amp; disgustingly wealthy seem to live near water.
1330958480082026498 2020-11-24 03:36:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RattlerGator Hope so.
1330835160300883968 2020-11-23 19:26:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @catherine___c I can’t believe she was voted back in.
1330834452570808323 2020-11-23 19:23:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrKRudd Oh please no more.
1330833648480710660 2020-11-23 19:20:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BevanShields Can we not hear from Rudd anymore. He had his time , blew it , &amp; now move on.
1330714969604702210 2020-11-23 11:29:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore @VIM84437144 Yes
1330714149236588544 2020-11-23 11:25:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JohnRuddick2 Agree.
1330707671033384960 2020-11-23 11:00:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden What a cheek. What about the millions raised but obviously not used funding rallies.
1330707064075681793 2020-11-23 10:57:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KyleKashuv I think they are building up to him being excused as president on grounds of dementia. That is if he gets to be president.
1330706498989617153 2020-11-23 10:55:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Thomas1774Paine Don’t be ridiculous. What a stupid comment.
1330705820661604352 2020-11-23 10:52:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JFNYC1 Omg.
1330638586966724608 2020-11-23 06:25:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @GrrrGraphics @plbrocks It’s a complete farce.
1330633361325314049 2020-11-23 06:04:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @GrumpyOLSoldier @AtomicPunk57 I agree.
1330625891219558400 2020-11-23 05:35:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Perduesenate Surely this should be done so that only the legal votes were counted,&amp;?only once. That is obviously what the law is.
1330625375928369152 2020-11-23 05:33:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @826Maureen Another sad story. This could have been different.
1330624714406993923 2020-11-23 05:30:28 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MayKelly Fake smiles.
1330623327073800192 2020-11-23 05:24:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AMErikaNGIRLLL He didn’t comply so I guess what’s ok for some is the message here.
1330622531821158401 2020-11-23 05:21:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SJPFISH This seems typical behavior of the left.
1330622087749193729 2020-11-23 05:20:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @newsbusters @SlimKAG No tricky questions that Biden hasn’t seen
1330506553556779008 2020-11-22 21:40:56 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KUTV2News Yes. Anyone would be better than Romney.
1330501368847630339 2020-11-22 21:20:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @smh @npomalley I don’t . Plus I didn’t vote for Morrison to back the agreement.
1330489812978176001 2020-11-22 20:34:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BreitbartNews No argument here.
1330346548392316932 2020-11-22 11:05:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Martin_Flanagan Just look at the opposition.
1330344244477911046 2020-11-22 10:55:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ewarren Lets be clear looking at the evidence being put forward by whistle blowers it looks like fraud could have been committed. The only way to sort this mess is for everyone to have their day in court.  If there is no evidence or fraud it can be proved one way or the other.
1330307053290708993 2020-11-22 08:28:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BoSnerdley @YohJudy Haven’t watched for a week now.

1330305498160259075 2020-11-22 08:22:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LindaWarriorGal @BeanK511 Of course most people don’t bc msm don’t show this.
1330305258690666496 2020-11-22 08:21:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AndrewKAG2020 @EinsteinsMagic These people are nasty unhinged people. Plus I have no idea who this person is but I will make sure I never watch his movies.
1330303117435555842 2020-11-22 08:12:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @dbongino I would embarrassed to take it.
1330302673535569920 2020-11-22 08:10:47 +0800 <bluesjack42> @raudzini @SkyNewsAust @rowandean Fascist communism mixed up with green ideology.
1330302437748580353 2020-11-22 08:09:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust @rowandean This person is a worry. I wonder what her royal highness thinks?
1330289114298638343 2020-11-22 07:16:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust @pwafork I live in SA &amp; I support the premier. They made decisions based on people who mostly told the truth. Hopefully an outbreak has been averted &amp; we can all move on. I hope anyone who has lost income can be helped.
1330287947585908742 2020-11-22 07:12:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Stevemcbricho I think her divisive behavior was the reason people did not warn to her. I’m trying very hard to be polite.
1330285552436977672 2020-11-22 07:02:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HbAlpaca Really. You would think it would be about something inspiring or newsworthy. Journalism is in a sad place at the moment.
1330283516723142661 2020-11-22 06:54:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PamelaGeller That’s it then.
1330283160718991365 2020-11-22 06:53:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BreitbartNews Mathematical impossible.
1330282988291170307 2020-11-22 06:52:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @gatewaypundit He looks pretty pleased with himself. Probably knew he was going to win.
1330282581452091394 2020-11-22 06:50:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Tangomitteckel @gatewaypundit @DineshDSouza Check them first.
1330281903170211841 2020-11-22 06:48:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @badluck_jones That’s clever.

1330273902665359363 2020-11-22 06:16:28 +0800 <bluesjack42> @_evelynrae Good quote.
1330269083456122880 2020-11-22 05:57:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RexChapman @ZERP_589 I love the guy giving his clothes to a stranger.
1330267015358066689 2020-11-22 05:49:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LadyRedWave @EpochTimes I’m surprised I didn’t get one in Australia. Crazy.
1330266468060172291 2020-11-22 05:46:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @FiveRights @AnnaBD20 We watched the election in Australia &amp; were very suspicious of the last hours. If this happened the other way around we know there would be lawyers involved &amp; no conceding from the dems. Why have elections if there is opportunities for fraud. USA is supposedly a democracy.
1330262174271475719 2020-11-22 05:29:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @anonpatriotq @nancymarie4159 If crimes have been committed, America needs to follow their laws &amp; send them to jail, no matter how powerful they are.
1330260398495371265 2020-11-22 05:22:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Tony__Heller It’s all very strange. Whatever the weather does cools, heats , rains, snows or just doesn’t keep at the same temperature forever, it’s global warming. Weather people use terms like unprecedented when it is clearly not when looking back before records were kept.
1330258364211879936 2020-11-22 05:14:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @enchantment_g @WW_NEWS_ Look like ballots to me.
1330254961737920514 2020-11-22 05:01:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @hesenij @catturd2 There is.
1330175323346964482 2020-11-21 23:44:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kelliekelly23 He is starting to get really weird.
1330135821949743105 2020-11-21 21:07:47 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust Understatement.
1330131705030709249 2020-11-21 20:51:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PoliBard He is such a bore.
1330130879088390148 2020-11-21 20:48:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ellymelly Loved that show &amp; I don’t even care about cars.
1330130374752694273 2020-11-21 20:46:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BreitbartNews Obama has aged.
1330081496049340418 2020-11-21 17:31:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @826Maureen @AnnastaciaMP How could anyone have voted that person in again. Let him home.
1330080235757441024 2020-11-21 17:26:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @826Maureen @AnnastaciaMP Ffs. What is wrong with these politicians.
1330079141815836680 2020-11-21 17:22:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SamDavi99667843 Pity they don’t do anything useful.
1330078781193805825 2020-11-21 17:21:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @WeAreWoke777_2 @barryv223 Twitter seems to be playing funny at the moment. Not interested in the truth at the moment.
1330064754006691840 2020-11-21 16:25:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @stillgray We feel the same way in Australia. If USA goes to communism the world will be a poorer place. Trump needs support &amp; some of those pathetic rhinos make me sick.
1330063466707759105 2020-11-21 16:20:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kaitlancollins So??
1330023052751486977 2020-11-21 13:39:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @teslachick @TuckerCarlson They are obviously trying to stop  fair comments.
1330021591967694848 2020-11-21 13:33:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TuckerCarlson A little bit weak. Hedging your bets. Don’t really blame you but hope when this happens &amp; the proof is there you will report it.
1330013970955046914 2020-11-21 13:03:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> What is happening with tweetin. I can’t see the retweets
1329958900800491520 2020-11-21 09:24:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kramerreport @bindyb123 Not a mask in sight.
1329958656805257221 2020-11-21 09:23:47 +0800 <bluesjack42> @fern_60 Surely this is a joke.
1329938134377713666 2020-11-21 08:02:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @miranda_duke @BorisEP @realDonaldTrump Are you insane? The president has done more than person for USA. Biden could scarcely get out of his basement.
1329937796795023362 2020-11-21 08:00:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @NikhilKheni @BorisEP @realDonaldTrump Never seen him stutter in all his years in govt.
1329937507681673217 2020-11-21 07:59:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DLaVa84 @BorisEP @realDonaldTrump He doesn’t stutter it’s mental cognitive decline as seen in dementia. Either way not nice to make fun of but he should not be running for president ffs.
1329937099663962112 2020-11-21 07:58:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @bluemangos @BorisEP @realDonaldTrump They are both a serious danger to the office of USA president.
1329936925667459072 2020-11-21 07:57:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BorisEP @realDonaldTrump It is so disgusting to expose a mentally deteriorating person to this.
1329935624317530113 2020-11-21 07:52:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SamDavi99667843 What is a worry for me is that he was actually our prime minister. The man seems to be unhinged.
1329927772727218176 2020-11-21 07:21:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MadamCurious @MrKRudd I think Rudd needs a psyche evaluation. Just saying.
1329926197157924865 2020-11-21 07:14:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HillaryClinton Or one woman’s ego more to the point.
1329924488176156673 2020-11-21 07:08:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @chuckwoolery Exactly.
1329894099571200001 2020-11-21 05:07:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EricMMatheny Good point.
1329892115409633280 2020-11-21 04:59:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PeterWallaceAU I support the premier. I hope the person who lied is dealt with &amp; we can get back to normal ASAP without this spreading in the community.
1329889404538679297 2020-11-21 04:48:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @54321Aaaah @PeterOB24979769 Nobody would know what it would be like to be in fear of your life everyday. If wrong was done let it be dealt with in the courts.
1329766977569579009 2020-11-20 20:42:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ACTBrigitte @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews I still admire tucker but I think he is powerless.
1329766527273365506 2020-11-20 20:40:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Peter217945 You think this billionaire could scrub up better than this.
1329763726963007489 2020-11-20 20:29:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @tomselliott Just watched a compilation of Biden gaffs &amp; his views on race etc. from years gone by. It is really scary.
1329762941306998784 2020-11-20 20:26:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DJordanLane @tomselliott @lancesmith44 Those pantsuits.

1329762399314870272 2020-11-20 20:23:56 +0800 <bluesjack42> @tomselliott This is the person some people voted to be president?
1329762150726864897 2020-11-20 20:22:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CalebJHull Looks like fun.
1329761844806905862 2020-11-20 20:21:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CalebJHull Sarcasm I guess.
1329759714352107521 2020-11-20 20:13:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @sallymcmanus Back off sticking your nose in SA.
1329758794914545667 2020-11-20 20:09:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @IngrahamAngle He seems older.
1329690058803167234 2020-11-20 15:36:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @macsween_prue @marshall_steven Actually mind your own business. He did the right thing &amp; I as south Australian am glad they did.
1329689620225826818 2020-11-20 15:34:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @catherine___c Pathetic news.
1329609569861992449 2020-11-20 10:16:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SamDavi99667843 I don’t think I said that.
1329565953433059328 2020-11-20 07:23:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DrBiden He might end up president of the nursing home the poor man will be confined to. It’s a farce &amp; really cruel to let this continue.
1329554649267929090 2020-11-20 06:38:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @dwright100 @IngrahamAngle He is not a stutterer. He did not stutter in the past. He is obviously suffering from some mental decline. It is really disgusting putting him through this.
1329553327315509248 2020-11-20 06:33:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SamDavi99667843 Can we get the facts first before we vilify people. They are entitled to their day in court.
1329552889069465600 2020-11-20 06:31:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JuliaHB1 @margarethodge I hope this person has been arrested.
1329540121843023872 2020-11-20 05:40:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews This is just another example of falsifying the election from the democrats.
1329538866320003073 2020-11-20 05:35:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BreitbartNews Very sensible.
1329531933039083520 2020-11-20 05:08:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AmberX994874 I used to watch bolt. No more .
1329402323836096512 2020-11-19 20:33:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust @marshall_steven Maybe the lockdowns are working in this case.
1329401676910927872 2020-11-19 20:30:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Gallo_Ways They deserve good representation.
1329399347251855361 2020-11-19 20:21:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @monica_clare1 Actually I think we need to lockdown for a while to stop the spread. I am more annoyed the testing seems to have been lacking around the medi hotels.
1329384558056284161 2020-11-19 19:22:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DblVisionShow @TheRightMelissa Biden doesn’t look very busy.
1329383330341523457 2020-11-19 19:17:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MarkSainzFit @carriesheffield I think they are saying they did find irregularities, then they were threatened, their children also. Now they have obviously decided to do the right thing. Very brave.
1329380659958145024 2020-11-19 19:07:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @826Maureen @LeeroySmith68 He has really cracked up.

1329270089707712513 2020-11-19 11:47:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SexCounseling Retire gracefully wanker.
1329269779694120961 2020-11-19 11:46:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ACTBrigitte No.
1329269616279920640 2020-11-19 11:45:47 +0800 <bluesjack42> @chuckwoolery They are twins separated at birth.
1329269240285708294 2020-11-19 11:44:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AusAntiLeft Ignorant but try to believe all is good.
1329172415146987520 2020-11-19 05:19:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AltoCarol @AlboMP I’m liberal but I am glad labor are being supportive here in SA.
1329045718204510208 2020-11-18 20:56:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrKRudd I think Rudd has lot the plot. Not that he had it.
1328784068339593221 2020-11-18 03:36:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DailyCaller It’s almost as if it’s normal behavior.
1328634194080145408 2020-11-17 17:40:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Canberroo Tim flannery&amp; his stupid predictions. He still is lauded by the left.
1328528100192264193 2020-11-17 10:39:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Patrici15767099 Maybe don’t give them ideas.
1328527890539892736 2020-11-17 10:38:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MelissaJorene @nypost Yes as long as he was legally voted in.
1328527605377560579 2020-11-17 10:37:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @nypost So she is saying ignore any mistakes, fraud or whatever &amp; just move on. The democrats did not make it smooth for trump.
1328492907968380928 2020-11-17 08:19:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @IngrahamAngle The one honest thing Biden said.
1328491045760352256 2020-11-17 08:12:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @janereiss1 @kirstiealley @60Minutes Your bio you say you are a spreader of kindness. Don’t think so.
1328489353031532545 2020-11-17 08:05:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AdamLaxalt These are only the ones that are being found. It means if fraud or mistakes were made there why not everywhere?
1328488964748034048 2020-11-17 08:03:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MiloForSenate Good thinking.
1328485641638739968 2020-11-17 07:50:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Qtah17 About time.
1328458894159429632 2020-11-17 06:04:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Breaking911 If.
1328444327903719424 2020-11-17 05:06:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @bette_oh The only way. He is protected from different difficult question apparently.
1328443350215577600 2020-11-17 05:02:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BreitbartNews Good. If someone has committed a crime they should be investigated &amp; charged. If they are innocent they shouldn’t be concerned.
1328429537709887489 2020-11-17 04:07:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @smanning00 @avoiceforothers @1776Stonewall She is probably nervous. Imagine trying to tell the truth to the media knowing she could be targeted. I hope she has protection. I think her nervousness shows she is scared.
1328305388421201923 2020-11-16 19:54:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DC_Draino No Fox News. In Australia now only watch tucker, the five, Greg, Laura.

1328257733615763458 2020-11-16 16:44:56 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PoliBard I’m just starting to get panicked again. I don’t know why but you just don’t want to run out.
1328257186070347776 2020-11-16 16:42:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @catherine___c Yes I’d rather not subject myself to that bs.

1327810438705233920 2020-11-15 11:07:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @seanhannity The first thing she has said that sense.

1327744740662493185 2020-11-15 06:46:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrAndyNgo The looting starts from the violent antifa .
1327743410682294272 2020-11-15 06:41:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore @TheDemocrats Definitely.
1327740101368057857 2020-11-15 06:28:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrAndyNgo @RichieMcGinniss They are so violent &amp; can only attack lone women. Utter cowardly scum.
1327738055923429377 2020-11-15 06:19:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RubinReport @VBofPerth Very unusual way of protesting in USA. If only it would catch on.
1327736507570954240 2020-11-15 06:13:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DawnTJ90 In a hundred years or so &amp; we are invaded by aliens they will go what stupid life form lived on this planet. They had everything but they destroyed it.  So sad.
1327735238315786240 2020-11-15 06:08:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @cheryl1492 @MTGoldblum This is scary.
1327733067117543424 2020-11-15 06:00:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RyanAFournier The difference between peaceful protests &amp; the others.
1327732146383904768 2020-11-15 05:56:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust @realDonaldTrump She is a Democrat. Was she there watching every count, does she know if there were glitches in the system &amp; can she explain the number of dead people voting?
1327588984529162240 2020-11-14 20:27:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Kate18660449 Their policies are not green. I remember when trees were treasured, they are the green solution not machines.
1327588036725547008 2020-11-14 20:23:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews Obama once again belittling the American people.
1327587282354720779 2020-11-14 20:20:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RedPillBM Suspicious or even very suspicious. Actually impossible.
1327531609038286848 2020-11-14 16:39:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Kate18660449 @DisrnNews What is this man on. Whinge whinge. Forget the racial comments &amp; treat everyone the same.
1327453012952899585 2020-11-14 11:27:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @itskylefife He did. I feel for him &amp; USA.
1327360646824951808 2020-11-14 05:20:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AP I am sure they are happy with Biden in the White House.
1327359747821998081 2020-11-14 05:16:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CurtisHouck Who cares.
1327354589520175104 2020-11-14 04:56:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @margmopp @TheBatman1961 Maybe that’s why he bought a mansion by the water.
1327228237483687942 2020-11-13 20:34:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TheBatman1961 It’s almost like we never had heatwaves in summer.
1327227950706479106 2020-11-13 20:32:56 +0800 <bluesjack42> @bette_oh More than one.
1327227618081402880 2020-11-13 20:31:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kelliekelly23 He is such an angry ant.
1327152859318726659 2020-11-13 15:34:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @chantabock @plbrocks @WhosFibbing Yes he is still better than albo but that’s not saying much.
1327151791365120004 2020-11-13 15:30:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @debadamsb @Inferno0696085 @EpochTimes That’s quite a lot. How many more that haven’t been discovered yet.
1327150737953071105 2020-11-13 15:26:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PhilipH21343285 @2tweetaboutit So how much that has been donated to BLM activists has been shared with black people in need. Or did it all go to weapons, riot gear, generaly anything to cause looting &amp; riots. Serious question.
1327149536150769666 2020-11-13 15:21:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Deefadog4me @plbrocks @WhosFibbing No one would know what it would be like to face death from mostly unknown enemies. The enemy would not necessarily be in uniform but deadly.
1327148611621285889 2020-11-13 15:17:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JWSpry @mac83934 @MRobertsQLD @SouthwickMP @Melissa4Durack @AngusTaylorMP @rowandean I agree. It’s the people who can’t afford solar, those renting or on a pension.
1327136474224070656 2020-11-13 14:29:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MichaelMaus6 @ChrisRoss32 @AlboMP In a nutshell.
1327135847645392896 2020-11-13 14:26:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AlboMP Rubbish.
1327006055386148864 2020-11-13 05:51:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JamesOKeefeIII @JanMareeSmith2 Unbelievable. Have we heard hours of audio of fbi interviewing joe &amp; hunter Biden?
1327000680792408064 2020-11-13 05:29:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JackPosobiec She sounds sane.
1326997882059190272 2020-11-13 05:18:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealJamesWoods This man is out of control.
1326991730416123904 2020-11-13 04:54:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @rabidrightway @dbongino So true.
1326880624276246530 2020-11-12 21:32:47 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ACTBrigitte That’s what they do , it’s in their nature.
1326879976839290886 2020-11-12 21:30:13 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MillyMolly300 I feel his pain.
1326878944470073345 2020-11-12 21:26:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @disclosetv He is neither a scientist or rational.
1326688651745480704 2020-11-12 08:49:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AmberX994874 Beautiful.
1326653849378062336 2020-11-12 06:31:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Kate18660449 @chrissmithonair @rowandean Andrews seems to be a dictator who does not care for Australia. Just saying.
1326644095821885441 2020-11-12 05:52:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HLAurora63 @baalter @gatewaypundit Wow. The lies just keep coming.
1326641253778296834 2020-11-12 05:41:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @1776Stonewall I agree. I still watch tucker.
1326639842688557056 2020-11-12 05:36:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AmyMek @LisaMarieBoothe @winningatmylife Yes there used to be real investigative journalists.
1326638956906127360 2020-11-12 05:32:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews He is a twat.
1326523969399218176 2020-11-11 21:55:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @826Maureen It is totally evil.
1326522807375720448 2020-11-11 21:50:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ACTBrigitte Yes.
1326518454195662849 2020-11-11 21:33:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RitaPanahi What could possibly go wrong?
1326372726538432519 2020-11-11 11:54:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JackPosobiec Where is the tape?
1326371911417421824 2020-11-11 11:51:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore @FoxNews No. Just tucker.
1326371770170036226 2020-11-11 11:50:47 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrMichaelBurkes I
1326304360729473025 2020-11-11 07:22:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kayleighmcenany Agree my mum who is 102 lives with my family. Is more on the ball than Biden &amp; his new COVID advisor.
1326303342922932224 2020-11-11 07:18:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Katy00008281 @kayleighmcenany I won’t bother to list Biden’s unsuitability to be president except the Ukraine incident.
1326302888897904641 2020-11-11 07:17:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kayleighmcenany So they will get rid of Biden? Past his used by date according to this person.
1326296798843949056 2020-11-11 06:52:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @hareme2 @charliekirk11 Maybe they knew USA would be weaker.
1326296583692984326 2020-11-11 06:52:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @charliekirk11 The system must be democrat.
1326291732045029376 2020-11-11 06:32:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MarthaThomas20 I will even if many seem to have forgotten.
1326291186244485120 2020-11-11 06:30:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TyphoidMary7 No they are not honest in my opinion.
1326285472499290112 2020-11-11 06:07:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @sahilkapur @TheMarkPantano How do you know unless there is a recount.
1326284692555853824 2020-11-11 06:04:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @sebring1006 Ted Cruz would be a good president.
1326283794551169024 2020-11-11 06:01:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mboyeast @AriFleischer Not funny &amp; not relevant.
1326283516120686593 2020-11-11 06:00:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AriFleischer @YohJudy Why would anyone who believe in democracy, not want to make sure of its legitimacy.
1326283061978279938 2020-11-11 05:58:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KeillerDon The democrats spent the whole trump presidency trying to dig up dirt on an elected president.
1326282720733876224 2020-11-11 05:56:56 +0800 <bluesjack42> @marshall_steven Lest we forget. Thank you Steven Marshall for the acknowledgement of those paid the ultimate sacrifice.
1326279724482535425 2020-11-11 05:45:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @joecardillo @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump How do you personally know there is no evidence, or that there were no numerous glitches in the software, no tampering with ballots. The only way is a thorough investigation or recount.
1326276783029694464 2020-11-11 05:33:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @stillgray @DeepSmoke2 It is disgusting.
1326274017326559232 2020-11-11 05:22:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @rweagley @1776Stonewall There is evidence.
1326273723901513728 2020-11-11 05:21:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @battletime331 @1776Stonewall Trump did say that mail in ballots could be open to fraud.
1326272824676294656 2020-11-11 05:17:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @1776Stonewall @JamesDoss50 What could possibly be wrong here.
1326272572074258432 2020-11-11 05:16:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MarciaSessler @sheila06942158 Tucker Carlson is a legend.
1326272128929296578 2020-11-11 05:14:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @1776Stonewall If votes were changed via fraud or glitches it means the right number of votes could have been given to the wrong candidate. This could affect the result of the election. This is a simple mathematical equation. One candidate gets more votes in different states they win.
1326270927558963200 2020-11-11 05:10:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Dinkeldash @1776Stonewall He just can’t tell the truth.
1326270753268920321 2020-11-11 05:09:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @1776Stonewall That’s a lot.
1326269890488012800 2020-11-11 05:05:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SusanCo84274112 @charliekirk11 But they don’t act violently. That’s the point of the tweet.
1326269575504093184 2020-11-11 05:04:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @charliekirk11 No bc they are unhinged.
1326269379630100480 2020-11-11 05:03:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @donaldrusso994 Yes.
1326268813201977344 2020-11-11 05:01:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrAndyNgo @JerryNadler These people are totally unhinged.
1326267490234634240 2020-11-11 04:56:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @alexsalvinews He is always so sensible.
1326264992425943041 2020-11-11 04:46:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore Definitely not. If even a few votes were changed, lost or deliberately altered its wrong.
1326264470209880064 2020-11-11 04:44:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DireccionRodri Never give up will be this little kids motto in life. Beautiful.
1326147477959925762 2020-11-10 20:59:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @stillgray She is up there.
1326083359823462401 2020-11-10 16:44:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Kate18660449 Really bill. I don’t know how you can even comment.
1325905044273725440 2020-11-10 04:56:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RomanticOptimis @DailyCaller I am the same. I feel like I can’t breathe.
1325780757197910027 2020-11-09 20:42:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @markbjardine @DaisyCousens There seems to have been many problems with the election. Whether it is fraud, glitches or just incompetence, it should be investigated by the courts to see who the American people voted to be their president.
1325722462856736769 2020-11-09 16:50:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @forlornfollower @theheraldsun I can’t watch him anymore. So negative.
1325700072546267136 2020-11-09 15:21:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @macsween_prue It is not a stutter. But the poor man obviously has the start of dementia.
1325699647143227392 2020-11-09 15:20:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HbAlpaca I feel sick. These people are not human.
1325654445577834501 2020-11-09 12:20:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ACTBrigitte What she has said in the past is not very Vice Presidential &amp; certainly not good for a president.
1325624968311238662 2020-11-09 10:23:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ACTBrigitte At the moment have resisted turning them on.
1325624711858937856 2020-11-09 10:22:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ellymelly They seem to enjoy doing that. Weirdos.
1325624490504540160 2020-11-09 10:21:22 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Turdface70 Apparently he was with joe on stage.
1325586548629233664 2020-11-09 07:50:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @superswingfire @SkyNewsAust @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Yes what else did the romans do.
1325586217736396801 2020-11-09 07:49:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Wotyalookinatay @SkyNewsAust @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden There seems to have been humans with agendas against a fair election.
1325585898558251008 2020-11-09 07:48:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Actually there seems to be plenty of evidence so why don’t we let the courts decide not msm.
1325585642902859777 2020-11-09 07:47:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MelodyMac51 This is the hate that exists in the party of nastiness. How is that uniting together in joy &amp; happiness that those 2 are promoting now.?
1325548782805635072 2020-11-09 05:20:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @demopublicanok @Neen_Katzmann @gatewaypundit What could possibly go wrong???
1325547654999257089 2020-11-09 05:16:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AlonsoPrado @BreitbartNews I don’t mind if someone criticizes any politician but when it’s one-sided then there is a problem. Everyone could see the bias during the first debate.
1325547006698287104 2020-11-09 05:13:28 +0800 <bluesjack42> @urika2md @BreitbartNews I am very disappointed in Fox News. There are always 2 sides to everything &amp; if the facts are there that there are irregularities in the voting process how can we trust there are not enough to flip an election either way.
1325426267211010048 2020-11-08 21:13:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BreitbartNews @parentchain It is not possible for a whole dump of votes to go to one candidate.
1325424184944594947 2020-11-08 21:05:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden Just words &amp; platitudes.
1325414481715896320 2020-11-08 20:26:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust @SharriMarkson @realDonaldTrump Depends on widespread.
1325359600107888640 2020-11-08 16:48:47 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JWSpry This man is a worry. I fear for him in the White House.
1325358394899755010 2020-11-08 16:43:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust @rowandean @JoeBiden And he is right.
1325358028988706816 2020-11-08 16:42:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TurnbullMalcolm You are such a git.
1325349739492040704 2020-11-08 16:09:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @206HawksGuy @GregGutfeldShow Love them all.
1325349371043434496 2020-11-08 16:08:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @martyweber74 @GregGutfeldShow No he didn’t.
1325349308984483840 2020-11-08 16:07:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @GregGutfeldShow @Peter217945 I love Greg. The best summary of trumps presidency.
1325344934023421952 2020-11-08 15:50:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore Not yet. Just want a fair election. Not to much to ask.
1324947572826337280 2020-11-07 13:31:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BuzzPatterson Impossible.
1324946857873690624 2020-11-07 13:28:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @guy_cheney @ACTBrigitte It’s not stuttering when you don’t know who your wife is, what day it is, what the last dem presidents name is, what year it is, what state he is in &amp; a lot of other gaffe he made. It’s dementia.
1324946153641713667 2020-11-07 13:25:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TheLastSquatch @ACTBrigitte That is not dementia it is total frustration at the lack of transparency in this election.
1324945905984835584 2020-11-07 13:24:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ACTBrigitte Think? I assume it is obviously some form of dementia.

1324704093667954688 2020-11-06 21:24:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @GregRubini @Truthsetsufree9 Bit late.
1324700987391574016 2020-11-06 21:11:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TheJessieWoo Have you ever looked in the mirror mate.?
1324614488666955777 2020-11-06 15:27:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore I don’t know.
1324614288116363269 2020-11-06 15:27:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @catherine___c Oh really just retire gracefully mate.
1324614081865633794 2020-11-06 15:26:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SamDavi99667843 I’d rather go to the dentist.
1324554472027164677 2020-11-06 11:29:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @WasSnowball @Bill_of_freedom @KamVTV You are a Biden watcher. What is your point.
1324553291687079937 2020-11-06 11:24:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @hgavin123 @CandyComedy @KamVTV Nursing home.
1324553027412389889 2020-11-06 11:23:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CandyComedy @KamVTV What the hell are you talking about?
1324552855387213825 2020-11-06 11:23:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KamVTV So they are have something to hide.
1324543707408855041 2020-11-06 10:46:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @OMGTheMess Exactly how would they know. The opportunity for fraud in the USA is endless without voter ID.
1324543032192987136 2020-11-06 10:44:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @jgint @KamVTV @A_Comfy_Chair Wow I would like to see that.
1324542560400863233 2020-11-06 10:42:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore I suspect there is. How much I guess we will never know. It is pretty sad USA can’t run a simple voter ID election.
1324332768495497217 2020-11-05 20:48:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @josephfischer09 @thepandaman @D0gFacedPony @Deb4trump66 No one is checking though.
1324332341062348806 2020-11-05 20:46:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @D0gFacedPony Why is this person angrily throwing things in the rubbish. It is really unbelievable that no one is checking him.
1324331123929800705 2020-11-05 20:41:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @red_red_rita @realDonaldTrump @GOPChairwoman @RudyGiuliani @TuckerCarlson @IngrahamAngle @DonaldJTrumpJr @PressSec It seems to have happened in many states. America has to do something, this is just a farce.
1324327883146293248 2020-11-05 20:29:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TmsKeith @Tim_jbo It was funny but I thought he would be like that. Had been annoying me for a while.
1324327026149392385 2020-11-05 20:25:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Tim_jbo I’m over bolt.
1324263491646091265 2020-11-05 16:13:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @J_TrumpIN I hope so.

1324132731358380032 2020-11-05 07:33:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealJamesWoods It was totally inappropriate.
1324132153915924480 2020-11-05 07:31:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BenJackd1 @EricMMatheny Zilch.
1323972030186729472 2020-11-04 20:55:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @catherine___c This guy was very annoying.
1323744299352158208 2020-11-04 05:50:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RyanAFournier I think you are being too kind. What is left of communism??
1323739381153239041 2020-11-04 05:30:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SJPFISH @BittyStone No. Just heard him rambling this morning. It’s sad really.
1323738803048099840 2020-11-04 05:28:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @catherine___c It is so weird that democrats don’t know they were the founders of the KKK.
1323731670164336640 2020-11-04 04:59:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @bearhill14 @DrBiden Normal?? You have to be kidding.

1323570929700466689 2020-11-03 18:21:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PeterWallaceAU @9NewsMelb Unbelievable.
1323534911655981060 2020-11-03 15:58:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @OMGTheMess He is such a I want to say wanker but I better not.
1323508755556753410 2020-11-03 14:14:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BrandonStraka All of the above.
1323440128031817728 2020-11-03 09:41:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @goodfoodgal Always part of the plan maybe.
1323433220700921856 2020-11-03 09:14:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mariech68063792 I think we know why.
1323431879723216896 2020-11-03 09:08:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MichaelKeaton Another one I won’t ever watch again.
1323430004093431808 2020-11-03 09:01:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LinkCommand @JackPosobiec Love it.
1323423971019157504 2020-11-03 08:37:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DraftKings @RealBasedMAGA @realDonaldTrump What is wrong with Colorado???
1323423708493479936 2020-11-03 08:36:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @cjdtwit @dawg_lb @realDonaldTrump This violence &amp; anarchy is encouraged by many so called elites on the left. You support this behavior by not condemning. You are just as guilty.
1323421948764803072 2020-11-03 08:29:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Hoosiers1986 No because I believe in democracy , which is the right to vote the people in you want to run your country.
1323381681407995904 2020-11-03 05:49:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TimRunsHisMouth I would vote whatever these so called elites are voting.
1323380739392462848 2020-11-03 05:45:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @bette_oh Why does she keep laughing?? It is so annoying.
1323376761539760128 2020-11-03 05:29:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TheLeoTerrell The nastiness of some of the far left is in that one sentence.
1323367969473372164 2020-11-03 04:54:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ACTBrigitte Security for western cultures.
1323257542206582786 2020-11-02 21:35:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Luna_paris @Patriqtscott I really can’t see these 2 hanging out together.
1323256351657582592 2020-11-02 21:31:13 +0800 <bluesjack42> @jtLOL @benshapiro The sad thing is these gaffs &amp; complete nonsensical waffle will follow this person from now on. This is what he will be remembered for. His handlers should be ashamed.
1323247901036802049 2020-11-02 20:57:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @bennyjohnson @jjauthor I thought the FBI were the brave men who fought the bad guys attempting to destroy America. Seems not so much now.
1323142092722298880 2020-11-02 13:57:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MajorPatriot Just look at the video the Biden bus went over the line. Sorted .
1323136013795950592 2020-11-02 13:33:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump I get it.
1323135096631697409 2020-11-02 13:29:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LeeSmithDC @ThomasWIttig3 And he waited up to welcome home the American rescued by the seals.
1323133567380041730 2020-11-02 13:23:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @NoticiasContra1 @NateMN12 @Breaking911 I can’t speak Spanish but I think I agree.
1323132725033775105 2020-11-02 13:19:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore People came to USAfir a better life. Why would they want to live in a socialist country run by democrats. Apparently they don’t.
1323105900295385090 2020-11-02 11:33:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @reddotinaustin @DailyCaller @jaketapper No apparently.
1323105828186959872 2020-11-02 11:33:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DailyCaller @titansowell Can it stop please.
1323105444261371904 2020-11-02 11:31:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Aldrpeg4 @jmikesharp Oh dear.

1323101238263648259 2020-11-02 11:14:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AusAntiLeft Thanks saves me working out the time in south Australia. I feel sick, scared &amp; hopeful that USA does not vote Biden in.
1323099546797309952 2020-11-02 11:08:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @wolfblitzer Why do you think these people are scared for their families, their livelihoods if trump is elected. The left have threatened violence , it’s in their nature. Yes it is sad but this is what supporting violence when you can’t get what you want, causes.
1323098277701562368 2020-11-02 11:03:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @chuckwoolery They are such a weird lot.
1323097687772733440 2020-11-02 11:00:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Thomas1774Paine I don’t think many care about your stomach problems.
1323096906935922688 2020-11-02 10:57:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealJamesWoods He just can’t stop plagiarizing. Not an original thought or idea.
1323096318751899648 2020-11-02 10:55:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust It’s not the curfew itself but what caused the lockdowns.
1323095822372724736 2020-11-02 10:53:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DFBHarvard @FoxNews No.

1323094584826556418 2020-11-02 10:48:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TrumpWarRoom I don’t think anyone would miss platitude joe.
1323045297115684864 2020-11-02 07:32:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @poetWOAgun @Jamierodr14 @realDonaldTrump Pity there was no social distancing then.
1323043794833469440 2020-11-02 07:26:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrAndyNgo @ergodrake So sorry you were treated this way but hopefully these people will have answer for their violence.
1323042573255020544 2020-11-02 07:21:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LisaMarieBoothe Imagine if he had the support of msm &amp; some of his own party. He would have smashed it out of the park. Maybe this time.
1323041732208988160 2020-11-02 07:18:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Will_of_Ockham @eavesdropann Love it.
1323039877739343872 2020-11-02 07:11:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RepStevenSmith @gatewaypundit Maybe the fake one could be less fake.
1323038924327907328 2020-11-02 07:07:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ChadwickWiz @TheRISEofROD Looking good Nancy.
1323037289354719232 2020-11-02 07:00:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @burn_loot @RealBasedMAGA Let him go democrats. It is now beyond funny it is downright cruel.
1323036608275247109 2020-11-02 06:58:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AlbertaGrl @waynes21 It was probably banned bc there are people who hate. I’m not American &amp; I hope you survive the violence &amp; hate promoted by the hateful.
1323033676855214081 2020-11-02 06:46:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Barnes_Law @curtiskaren @Peoples_Pundit @trafalgar_group @SusquehannaPR And me.
1323028218694176768 2020-11-02 06:24:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Usatorz1 @barmore27 Any excuse.
1323025900506505217 2020-11-02 06:15:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KingDrue17 If the far left get their way Americans might have to stand in food lines.
1323024716387397632 2020-11-02 06:10:47 +0800 <bluesjack42> @piepaulie It’s incredible that some don’t want to know the reasons why Victoria got the COVID response so wrong. Even in the interests of never letting it happen again. I personally would like to see those who lied &amp; let down the victims &amp; their families, be held accountable.
1323021264340967425 2020-11-02 05:57:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Females4DJT @barmore27 @realDonaldTrump That comment is one of the most important facts.
1323013817748520960 2020-11-02 05:27:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Spencerk_76 @TBeansprout @McguireScotty Lol. That me laugh amidst all the crying. At least you have a cat.
1323011663583305728 2020-11-02 05:18:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BlameReset @DC_Draino That is the trouble the msm only focus on anything trump supporters do not the antics &amp; violence from the left.
1323009250105327616 2020-11-02 05:09:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealJamesWoods They are insane,
1323007480306176000 2020-11-02 05:02:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AusAntiLeft Agree. The poor man has tried his heart out. I hope for our sakes USA votes him back.
1322885918974308352 2020-11-01 20:59:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Thomas1774Paine Who cares.
1322850165456216065 2020-11-01 18:37:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Bill_Weimer_ @realDonaldTrump So true.

1322824028994695170 2020-11-01 16:53:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @cjtjgeol I find Shari a bit annoying.
1322767864596623360 2020-11-01 13:10:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Peter217945 He is inciting violence.
1322766815978647552 2020-11-01 13:05:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Patrici15767099 People don’t need forgiveness from this person. She should be asking for some though.
1322766465037070339 2020-11-01 13:04:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JackPosobiec Is that supposed to be a good thing???
1322763446522245121 2020-11-01 12:52:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BlessUSA45 @MelodyMac51 Wow.
1322759982001999874 2020-11-01 12:38:50 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DifalcoWilliam @NewsRaters He looks pathetic I don’t think he could blow out a candle.

1322755379885797379 2020-11-01 12:20:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore I don’t believe people are honestl in polls.
1322753448366858242 2020-11-01 12:12:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AmberX994874 I’m surprised he can go out in public without people calling him out on his useless predictions.
1322752460461539328 2020-11-01 12:08:56 +0800 <bluesjack42> @gatewaypundit @realDonaldTrump That’s what I call a peaceful rally.
1322746832561135618 2020-11-01 11:46:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Fibci2 @JoeBiden It makes me want to vomit watching this poor little girl.
1322745737239797760 2020-11-01 11:42:13 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealCandaceO @2tweetaboutit Not liking Meghan is not racial. You can actually not like someone bc of their character.
1322744862190440448 2020-11-01 11:38:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BrentonAttwood @tribelaw @ItsBouquet Rubbish.
1322744547365904384 2020-11-01 11:37:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @tribelaw They could only be jailed if they are guilty of treason. Fair enough.
1322715682685939714 2020-11-01 09:42:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KaterynaNikola1 @baalter Who were they talking to.
1322715364808040448 2020-11-01 09:41:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KaterynaNikola1 @baalter Never seen such a speedy exit.
1322672772913405954 2020-11-01 06:52:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @dbongino Shouldn’t laugh but can’t help it.
1322672414174572544 2020-11-01 06:50:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @chuckwoolery Empty platitudes from Biden once again.
1322670658694729729 2020-11-01 06:43:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CHIZMAGA Articulate.
1322665750385979392 2020-11-01 06:24:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RickCalvert @kayleighmcenany The rest of his speeches are just platitudes.
1322665510337589249 2020-11-01 06:23:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kayleighmcenany @emilygirl3 Such a positive uplifting candidate. NOT.
1322665254229217280 2020-11-01 06:22:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @libertylovingam @TawniBoyd I liked Sean Connery at the time &amp; sad at his passing but Daniel Craig was the best in my opinion.
1322657416098402305 2020-11-01 05:51:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mikeschaf Platitude joe. No substance just platitudes.
1322655452283375616 2020-11-01 05:43:28 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mbracemoore Really.
1322654513119985664 2020-11-01 05:39:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TrumpStudents @RyanAFournier What is he saying? I think Biden is going downhill fast. Let him go  it is cruel.
1322654118205292544 2020-11-01 05:38:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @gatewaypundit I think even Obama is embarrassed at this charade.
1322651540927115264 2020-11-01 05:27:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @gatewaypundit @cristinalaila1 He really seems like a bully.
1322650250683666433 2020-11-01 05:22:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Rparkerscience @Patriqtscott Biden obviously loves his son as anyone would. But to call him an honorable man is a bit of a stretch.
1322649320194105344 2020-11-01 05:19:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @John_KissMyBot @AMErikaNGIRLLL They should be . If I was American, a trump supporter &amp; I was polled I probably am not telling the truth. The violence &amp; victimization towards trump voters is eveident. Anyway I consider my vote my business &amp; not some pollster on the phone.
1322645284732641280 2020-11-01 05:03:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @rentonMagaUK Look in the mirror old man &amp; look inside yourself &amp; then see who is ugly.
1322533927634919424 2020-10-31 21:40:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrAndyNgo Charming.
1322338057131945984 2020-10-31 08:42:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @eavesdropann What does that Acosta so called journalist think is normal??
1322337329701220352 2020-10-31 08:39:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Usatorz1 @barmore27 He can’t.
1322336054276358144 2020-10-31 08:34:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CHIZMAGA He is just rude.
1322335970809704448 2020-10-31 08:33:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Lrihendry @MattyCordasco Why?? Is that because they were things you should be ashamed of??
1322335056321417216 2020-10-31 08:30:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KellyannePolls He is not a nice person.
1322332689760841728 2020-10-31 08:20:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ReaganBattalion Omg she is creepy.
1322332114344312832 2020-10-31 08:18:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JackPosobiec What does that mean??
1322310807506493440 2020-10-31 06:53:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @drawandstrike @CallsignDrDoom She needs to go. Don’t care where just somewhere without the power to harm anyone.
1322310189345763329 2020-10-31 06:51:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @sabhlok @DanielAndrewsMP Says it all.
1322310025881161728 2020-10-31 06:50:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @_TheRealBecky1 @_Sm1ttyjr @realDonaldTrump This is the trouble with these pathetic rallies of Biden’s. Someone can call you out &amp; you have no where to hide joe.
1322308899546935296 2020-10-31 06:46:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Bob452020 @_Sm1ttyjr If I knew who this person was I wouldn’t watch him.
1322306977280634881 2020-10-31 06:38:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SimonCotter62 It’s a free country. At the moment.
1322294607091101696 2020-10-31 05:49:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DC_Draino Hope you are right.
1322293688832122880 2020-10-31 05:45:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RyanAFournier Amazing.
1322293513040453632 2020-10-31 05:45:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrDavidRuck @KamVTV That’s only bc no one wants to go to his rallies. It would make anybody feel uncomfortable watching someone with dementia struggling to be coherent. Very disturbing.
1322292856283828225 2020-10-31 05:42:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @gehrig38 @KamVTV See the trouble here is that the elite will always be able to fly, keep warm &amp; live life comfortably. It’s just the plebs who will suffer. The little people without jobs.
1322292188684845057 2020-10-31 05:39:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KamVTV Are they checking if they are electric cars.
1322291717794537472 2020-10-31 05:38:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kelliekelly23 Definitely not a fan. Although to be fair I always thought she was a bit unhinged to put it kindly.
1322291115391737856 2020-10-31 05:35:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @McKaylaRoseJ Oh let’s not bother talking about that lemon character. Don’t give him anymore publicity good or bad.
1322290615204241408 2020-10-31 05:33:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Hoosiers1986 @JoeBiden I don’t know him personally, obviously, but he does not seem like an honest truthful man who has a family who seem out of control. So I’m not a fan.
1322289898770948096 2020-10-31 05:30:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SVNewsAlerts What is her problem with following the will of the people. She needs to retire, too late to do it gracefully, but just go.
1322289530871836672 2020-10-31 05:29:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Tony_Yorkshire @jeanniejuno I remember him playing. Great player. I’m not a big soccer fan but used to watch in the old days.
1322288707722833921 2020-10-31 05:26:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PatrickArnold77 @waynes21 Glad to see officials are on the cases of fraud. Maybe not enough but something.
1322288339026767872 2020-10-31 05:24:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @heather_giron @TawniBoyd Really quite sad.
1322287911555903488 2020-10-31 05:22:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RedPillMaC Hopefully there are more like this lovely guy who decided to use his commonsense &amp; actually fact check about the candidates for president.
1322282272578396160 2020-10-31 05:00:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @anonpatriotq He makes me feel depressed.
1322153819174707200 2020-10-30 20:30:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @tomselliott @pocono_mtn @donlemon I suspect those people could be glad you are no longer in their lives. I would be.
1322151019438993408 2020-10-30 20:19:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @YellowCube7 @SullJack48 Guess they won’t vote for joe.
1322150148269510656 2020-10-30 20:15:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ExposeTheMedia Say what you mean. Really.
1322148715348414466 2020-10-30 20:09:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TheBaseIsBack @_Sm1ttyjr USA really needs to sort their voting system out. It’s getting like a third world country.
1322147255625764864 2020-10-30 20:04:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ellymelly @Nicholas_Reece I think Nicholas Reece is a guest every week just to remind us how crazy the left are.
1322000615942234112 2020-10-30 10:21:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kelliekelly23 Children &amp; animals how can you not love it.
1321999494355980288 2020-10-30 10:16:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore @IngrahamAngle Yes.
1321999058806874113 2020-10-30 10:15:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Proven_Right @realDonaldTrump It will be hard bc of the voting fraud but hopefully he will have another term for which he deserves after all the nastiness &amp; vitriol he has endured.
1321954072384073728 2020-10-30 07:16:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HANKSTERevolt @NewsRaters @gatewaypundit @FBI @TheJusticeDept @JoeBiden Plausible deniability.
1321953848706035714 2020-10-30 07:15:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @margmopp We only need one lefty outlet. They all come out with the same headlines, almost as though they colluded.
1321952802881503232 2020-10-30 07:11:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @donaldrusso994 Good.
1321949305754718208 2020-10-30 06:57:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @jsolomonReports @WelllDoYou The DOJ must be really busy at the moment.
1321947321307820032 2020-10-30 06:49:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Factinate Care factor.
1321942124930101248 2020-10-30 06:28:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TNSociallyMissy @realDonaldTrump Hope so.
1321939470929731584 2020-10-30 06:18:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DrNealHouston @JackySinAZ @CKeirns Have they all got votes for trump in them???
1321938462459654145 2020-10-30 06:14:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @John_KissMyBot @Hoosiers1986 His scriptwriters &amp;  prompters give him platitudes to role out but when asked off the cuff ,especially about his son the real angry Biden is evident.
1321932547991851008 2020-10-30 05:50:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrAndyNgo How cruel &amp; devastating for the Vietnamese community. If these people are protesting  why are they burning &amp; looting. It is so pointless.
1321931402158333952 2020-10-30 05:46:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @elavoie @stillgray So it’s old but that just shows how long people have known about the corruption from the Biden family &amp; nothing has been done.
1321930139828068353 2020-10-30 05:41:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @dbongino Seems like many so called elites, although I don’t know who she is, have anger issues.
1321928904936882178 2020-10-30 05:36:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PrisonPlanet It really is irrelevant what the motive was. To kill three random people in this horrific way is beyond reason.
1321927525640007680 2020-10-30 05:30:56 +0800 <bluesjack42> @rweagley @1776Stonewall If joe Biden who is running for president is involved then they are relevant.  If hunter Biden is being protected bc who father is that is relevant.
1321791549382909952 2020-10-29 20:30:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TheRISEofROD @gaye_gallops Not a nice thought but it seems they have crossed the line &amp; should be investigated.
1321789501509836801 2020-10-29 20:22:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BreitbartNews @CDW83828995 Those poor women.
1321788466309394432 2020-10-29 20:18:22 +0800 <bluesjack42> @35Leosa @Precliner Well the evidence is there with Biden bragging about it.
1321787241421697030 2020-10-29 20:13:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ExposeTheMedia Full marks to the interviewer. The reply did not cut it.
1321786659927597058 2020-10-29 20:11:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TMIWITW @AndrewSolender @DachsiesWMoxie In this case it’s both.
1321733506255396864 2020-10-29 16:39:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrAndyNgo What a weirdo.
1321729162810281984 2020-10-29 16:22:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MarkDice Really.
1321728666435428352 2020-10-29 16:20:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @McguireScotty Who says doggie do. A very drunk person . Terrifying this person is third in line.
1321727942653698048 2020-10-29 16:17:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MissHissyKat Agree especially about the hair.
1321662265762869248 2020-10-29 11:56:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Peter217945 Description applies to them both.
1321661840619794432 2020-10-29 11:55:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @hrenee80 Did they have copies???
1321661687074705408 2020-10-29 11:54:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AppleTV @springsteen No longer a fan.
1321660709445406720 2020-10-29 11:50:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore @seanhannity I do. I prefer tucker but hannity is ok in small doses.
1321659827597135872 2020-10-29 11:47:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Acosta You really are a very disturbed person.
1321659201320464384 2020-10-29 11:44:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @sniffydogs @Hollybun2 This is the trouble with the left. No one can have an opinion that differs from them.
1321658537483722752 2020-10-29 11:42:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MajorPatriot It’s in their nature. When you can’t get what you want resort to violence.
1321591510970716162 2020-10-29 07:15:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @UnsatiatedBlood @TuckerCarlson Joe Biden is &amp; he was involved according to evidence that should be investigated.
1321591158359748609 2020-10-29 07:14:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RenoCow @TuckerCarlson Unemployed Americans will be voting trump then.
1321583446347558912 2020-10-29 06:43:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KamalaHarris @lyncsmith I would not want this person anywhere near my back.
1321582596371881985 2020-10-29 06:40:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @theTiser @ColinJamesTiser Imagine the losses in Victoria.
1321578964331098112 2020-10-29 06:25:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @jacobkschneider How can the democrats win the election. No one at the rallies.
1321574414324920320 2020-10-29 06:07:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JulieReichwein1 @dawg_lb Why do Jews vote for democrats?
1321569538463297536 2020-10-29 05:48:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @thebias_news @JamesDoss50 Why is it that the Democrats seem involved in voter scams of some sort?
1321448073923416065 2020-10-28 21:45:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RodS108443078 The scandals just keep on coming.
1321447346161381376 2020-10-28 21:42:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AmberX994874 Just not a good year for Rudd.
1321267539905687552 2020-10-28 09:48:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JackPosobiec This is getting serious. Even in Australia I’m scared that one of our closest allies could potentially have a president voted in who could be blackmailed by communist regimes. The western worlds security is at stake.
1321265813635002369 2020-10-28 09:41:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @joshdcaplan I hope it is a brief about the truth. No protecting the Biden family.
1321265096882966530 2020-10-28 09:38:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @OBrien_Suzie @mpsmithnews If anyone listened to anything other than our ABC they might realize people have deemed Victoria per capita is the worst at dealing with the virus.
1321264588780761088 2020-10-28 09:36:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews Confusing envy with bewilderment that this person was voted in twice.
1321264156507426818 2020-10-28 09:34:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SaltwaterFix @OMGTheMess Unfortunately until he is held accountable we are all in this together.
1321263780454567938 2020-10-28 09:33:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @OMGTheMess It is so frustrating.
1321263479093784577 2020-10-28 09:32:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HbAlpaca Really this is so pathetic .
1321263102613049344 2020-10-28 09:30:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SamDavi99667843 I second that.
1321262963202748416 2020-10-28 09:30:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MissHissyKat How can anyone watch that.????
1321200084608937985 2020-10-28 05:20:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KingDrue17 You can agree &amp; admire someone or something without being in a cult. Maybe you just think trump has the best policies for USA, he actually cares about
1321199646396432385 2020-10-28 05:18:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @goodfoodgal @DanielAndrewsMP Sarcasm I guess.
1321198689256271872 2020-10-28 05:14:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @moonstien @wdunlap @realDonaldTrump Or dementia.
1321197767541223424 2020-10-28 05:11:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Beth_Alize She is an embarrassment. Just saying.
1321196849500311555 2020-10-28 05:07:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JohnRuddick2 @WhosFibbing Embarrassing.
1321195847623688193 2020-10-28 05:03:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CHIZMAGA Nothing surprises me anymore.
1321195589892067329 2020-10-28 05:02:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @lou_lou1958 @JoshFrydenberg @ScottMorrisonMP About time someone told it how it is.
1321067020025163780 2020-10-27 20:31:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Peter217945 Not that I care about this person but she typifies a looney left.
1321063097042300928 2020-10-27 20:16:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RitaPanahi I’m sure they have.
1321061488501555210 2020-10-27 20:09:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Tim_jbo @JoshFrydenberg @LiberalAus Wow Frydenberg so right. What happened in Victoria was just unnecessary &amp; cruel. I hope Victorians can come out of this in spite of the poor leadership of a few.
1321020591269277696 2020-10-27 17:27:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @tonytardio Really wonder what they would have said if he had actually hadn’t let 600 or more perish from the virus.
1320995913263845376 2020-10-27 15:49:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews Actually it won’t. The damage would come from the far left Marxist policies of the democrats.
1320932989409226752 2020-10-27 11:39:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DailyCaller Well off you go like all your elitist Hollywood lot. No one cares.
1320932437753409536 2020-10-27 11:36:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @OzraeliAvi Well said Jeff.
1320931800693141504 2020-10-27 11:34:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @margmopp How many was she actually talking to?
1320931341009993733 2020-10-27 11:32:28 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrMichaelBurkes Why wouldn’t she be. Perfect candidate so yes very glad.
1320875227652390912 2020-10-27 07:49:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @WelllDoYou @HbAlpaca I just can’t believe the arrogance.
1320875013067554816 2020-10-27 07:48:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @OldielocksNmo4 Yes I fell for it.
1320874177289596928 2020-10-27 07:45:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Thomas1774Paine I think you insulted yourselves. You have no credibility.
1320865363727319040 2020-10-27 07:10:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ChadwickWiz @gaye_gallops Well that made me cry.
1320863512671842304 2020-10-27 07:02:56 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ShopgirlAlic @RyanAFournier Really. Even in Australia there are people who admire &amp; listen to tucker.
1320857044807643136 2020-10-27 06:37:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CharleyBarley9 @kfisme Laughing hysterically somewhere.
1320853103395049472 2020-10-27 06:21:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @tmoney27 @RacySicilian That is what is disturbing.
1320852718924124160 2020-10-27 06:20:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RacySicilian @plbrocks No wonder creepy is his first name.
1320847634727194624 2020-10-27 05:59:50 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kyleolson4 It’s amazing when speaking off the cuff he is completely incoherent. Very suspicious.
1320843682128351234 2020-10-27 05:44:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @thebradfordfile She is inappropriate.
1320838212391038976 2020-10-27 05:22:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Redhead4645 @pocono_mtn These people need to know that they are not the most important people. Trump is a president trying to bring USA back from phony impeachment’s, COVID &amp; trying to restart the economy for all Americans.
1320834631109730304 2020-10-27 05:08:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BooGyrl13 @seanmdav More fool you then.
1320696167550730240 2020-10-26 19:57:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @itsjuststuff @ellymelly I’m sorry but if it was my family member ,you would hear about it.
1320695557090766850 2020-10-26 19:55:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ellymelly Stockholm.
1320480987499749377 2020-10-26 05:42:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AndrewForTrump @JanMareeSmith2 Why would anyone listen to brad Pitt. He is not a person to look up to.
1320477843730526209 2020-10-26 05:30:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @michaelbeatty3 @rentonMagaUK @realDonaldTrump This is a flawed man.

1320473629486804992 2020-10-26 05:13:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @margmopp I have said before &amp; I say again this man lacks empathy. Psychopathic.
1320472709097160704 2020-10-26 05:10:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BlessUSA45 Arrest her now.
1320472343290892288 2020-10-26 05:08:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @xreverie_x @Lisa_Wilkinson @theprojecttv Probably worried for herself &amp; husband. I would be with the threats &amp; violence happening from the rabid left.
1320470824063692800 2020-10-26 05:02:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LeBomber05 @Lisa_Wilkinson @theprojecttv Jealous.
1320470252602363905 2020-10-26 05:00:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @lou_lou1958 I agree.  Never could stand her.
1320467217603985408 2020-10-26 04:48:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LindaLiberty9 @BenJackd1 It must take a special kind of person who can hold back on allowing people in need to receive help, bc of your political gain.
1320465542231199744 2020-10-26 04:41:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RandyRRQuaid @murphycharlie78 These are people who could not openly show their support bc of violence threatened against them.
1320463577568825345 2020-10-26 04:33:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @IngrahamAngle That is a threat that surely no one wants to happen.
1320462995969851392 2020-10-26 04:31:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Bryan700 @Francis50441920 Worth a try.
1320462241213235200 2020-10-26 04:28:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Kaycee_314 @LouDobbs @gatewaypundit They didn’t release the tapes.
1320461809598431234 2020-10-26 04:26:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KabrisLite @LouDobbs @gatewaypundit Who has lied apparently many times.
1320461036533633024 2020-10-26 04:23:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LouDobbs @gatewaypundit I don’t really want to see these depressing videos but I think the FBI should really be. It appears they could be showing some behavior that could be used against the Bidens, which is not good when you are president.
1320459629655068672 2020-10-26 04:18:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust Wow not good.
1320458161363456001 2020-10-26 04:12:13 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealBobbyDMAGA I guess he hadn’t kept up with the latest scandal about the Biden family &amp; voting for a woman who is so insincere she couldn’t remember what state she was campaigning in.
1320456991068700673 2020-10-26 04:07:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @joshdcaplan Good finally stop this farce of smearing this very worthy candidate.
1320456482878443521 2020-10-26 04:05:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BGOnTheScene Really sad &amp; pathetic. Hope she doesn’t forget where she is campaigning.
1320455307957424128 2020-10-26 04:00:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JackPosobiec This is sad. Not only for the dad but voting for people who don’t deserve your vote.
1320362203967442944 2020-10-25 21:50:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DonaldJTrumpJr @CarolsCloset He is a grown man not a child.
1320361302431158273 2020-10-25 21:47:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TonyPaul45 The lies come easily,
1320360459745124352 2020-10-25 21:43:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Lisa_Wilkinson @theprojecttv Lisa Wilkinson should be more worried about the utter scandal going on in USA over joe Biden.
1320355133998260225 2020-10-25 21:22:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SassySouthern10 @VFL2013 @JoeBiden Says it all.
1320211061824319489 2020-10-25 11:50:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ShefferAnne @robbystarbuck So intelligent she didn’t know what state she was in. How she can pretend she cares about people, so sloppy &amp; arrogant.
1320210559124471808 2020-10-25 11:48:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @robbystarbuck Joe is not really that bright.
1320196419844595712 2020-10-25 10:52:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrKRudd Really just retire gracefully from all public life.
1320196219084234752 2020-10-25 10:51:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust @rowandean I would want to try any drug which is not harmful bc used safely by millions.
1320173546283302912 2020-10-25 09:21:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @catherine___c Love that. Flannerying should be entered into Australian language.
1320166678827651073 2020-10-25 08:53:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews If this is true. It is racist &amp; should be investigated.
1320162325282709504 2020-10-25 08:36:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @OMGTheMess @ItaButtrose Who do they mean by all? If they mean all the lefties at apparently our ABC, maybe they should represent all Australians, which they are not.
1320151614905176064 2020-10-25 07:54:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden She will have to. Biden can’t be a functioning president. So democrats will be voting in a far left president.
1320138245284347904 2020-10-25 07:00:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Fatbob2013 They will give a fuck when Australia is in serious trouble &amp; we ask for help.
1320136010789834752 2020-10-25 06:52:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CarmineSabia @bindyb123 How can Biden be in charge of USA when he didn’t know what day it is?
1320134544511520769 2020-10-25 06:46:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BillSparow1 @SkyNewsAust Actually a threat to any innocent person in Australia or anywhere is something I do worry about. Maybe you lack empathy but I’m sure most people are worried about any form of violence.
1320131664832466944 2020-10-25 06:34:50 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ShawnG927 @CraigAr64 Another one on my list of so called elites that I am banning.
1320129766574284800 2020-10-25 06:27:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KC_kasey_KC @DeanLindaC Is he allowed to drive??
1320127459832942592 2020-10-25 06:18:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EddieZipperer He is such a worry. His handlers must be tearing their hair out.
1320127038502563840 2020-10-25 06:16:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MsAvaArmstrong @crazyprofessor Common symptoms of dementia.

1320123895261753344 2020-10-25 06:03:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Thomas1774Paine Says it all really.
1320121794121011200 2020-10-25 05:55:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust @mirandadevine @JoeBiden He actually won’t do anything bc he did nothing for 47years. Stupid thing to say though.
1320121142913368064 2020-10-25 05:53:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JackDon0 @stillgray Always loved his work. I am so glad he is not like the De Niro &amp; Bette Midler types.
1320120140654993414 2020-10-25 05:49:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @OJLizz @stillgray He is an a lister in my book bc he is a great actor.
1320119797418323969 2020-10-25 05:47:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Geburr22 @stillgray Actually that’s not true.
1320119570363891714 2020-10-25 05:46:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @stillgray @BeanK511 Is he the best person? Love his work &amp; his attitude &amp; I’m an atheist. Wish there were more like him in Hollywood.
1320115371915923457 2020-10-25 05:30:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @imbalaska @DanielAndrewsMP He is showing signs of a dictator, hence the nickname. Says it all.
1320114965877944320 2020-10-25 05:28:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BawdenSnoek If this person is voted in as president how would he have the stamina to show up for work each day?? He can hardly campaign &amp; has called a lid constantly.
1320113701370777602 2020-10-25 05:23:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @dbongino This is such condescending bs from both these lefties. She is racist &amp; Fallon is too for finding it funny.
1320112377849733120 2020-10-25 05:18:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @whatgives1313 So would I &amp; im in Australia.
1319991652644081665 2020-10-24 21:18:28 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MelodyMac51 @markbjardine How was this allowed to happen??
1319990305270067201 2020-10-24 21:13:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @cjtjgeol Yes don’t come here .
1319989735448735744 2020-10-24 21:10:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PeterWallaceAU What a complete eyesore. For what??
1319989476521775104 2020-10-24 21:09:50 +0800 <bluesjack42> @margmopp He really is a bitter twisted man,
1319989167292518402 2020-10-24 21:08:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @netz_melb Not really.
1319779092384763905 2020-10-24 07:13:50 +0800 <bluesjack42> @bueller_tom @JaneCaro This has to be sarcasm. No one could be that much of a nasty person to think that sounds a normal way to view her little entitled world.
1319777877781483520 2020-10-24 07:09:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @adjunctprofesor @baalter Joe Biden will obviously have no influence as a president. Harris etc. will be running the show.
1319770939265957888 2020-10-24 06:41:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TrumpWarRoom @MarjoT13 It’s amazing how Biden is now portraying himself as a caring politician. Looking back he appears to be totally different.
1319627956998684672 2020-10-23 21:13:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Monster_Dome @JaneCaro He might of heard about her that’s why.
1319392916431749121 2020-10-23 05:39:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @my3monkees @mikandynothem Does she have dementia as well?
1319391235774136320 2020-10-23 05:32:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JohnCornyn @CHIZMAGA One word childish.
1319385847754420224 2020-10-23 05:11:13 +0800 <bluesjack42> @GroveKilosdad73 @pam_sands This is up there with childishness.
1319385047602847744 2020-10-23 05:08:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KamVTV The minute everyone saw how Biden was in decline I think I realized what the plan was.
1319383345235542016 2020-10-23 05:01:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @zerohedge @TheRISEofROD That old chestnut
1319244546132226050 2020-10-22 19:49:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews Yuk.
1319095811074998272 2020-10-22 09:58:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MichaelJFell @stevwgn7 He is another one whose used by date is over.
1319095088283226112 2020-10-22 09:55:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @theonlyrymac Embarrassing.
1319094913389088768 2020-10-22 09:55:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @bet365_aus Only tiger fans will most likely go for them while football lovers will probably go for Geelong. Can’t stand Richmond.
1319094482118213632 2020-10-22 09:53:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Kate3015 This person shouldn’t be in government. He is a complete idiot.
1319094166324867072 2020-10-22 09:52:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Fatbob2013 Absolutely.
1319093764040716290 2020-10-22 09:50:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Fatbob2013 @OMGTheMess Not surprised. Will not be watching.
1319093483194347520 2020-10-22 09:49:28 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore @JoeBiden Not sure but why aren’t they investigating at least.
1319023638159319040 2020-10-22 05:11:56 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RepStevenSmith @HbAlpaca How embarrassing.
1319022483098324993 2020-10-22 05:07:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @826Maureen No he did bc he is a criminal.
1319022030860087296 2020-10-22 05:05:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JackPosobiec How disgusting is that? Have they been arrested yet?
1319021537119203329 2020-10-22 05:03:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @tothelostmonth @RICHHABITS @RyanAFournier The trouble is that Harris does &amp; there is know way Biden can be president. He has dementia. Plus even Harris’s husband said he was going to be married to the US president.
1319017136862289920 2020-10-22 04:46:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JackPosobiec That is actually quite sad &amp; pathetic.

1319016229839884289 2020-10-22 04:42:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @w_terrence Is there anyone there?
1319015496893648896 2020-10-22 04:39:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews Even more reason to think it’s true.
1319012880264560640 2020-10-22 04:29:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PatriotGeorgia @stevwgn7 If it’s true obviously everyone should hear it.
1318910707526561793 2020-10-21 21:43:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MarianaHirmas More lies.
1318910210556059649 2020-10-21 21:41:13 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SirMickW So very wrong. Who is looking out for the children?
1318909253214564353 2020-10-21 21:37:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JackPosobiec I want to vomit.
1318906707074981888 2020-10-21 21:27:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @hrenee80 I think they are panicking.
1318820491365249024 2020-10-21 15:44:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealJamesWoods That is feta threat.
1318783881105924096 2020-10-21 13:19:13 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KamVTV It really. Everything about them is negative &amp; nasty.
1318783230040928258 2020-10-21 13:16:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore @JoeBiden Yes.
1318782830671921152 2020-10-21 13:15:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore @JoeBiden Definitely.
1318782727982731264 2020-10-21 13:14:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AmberX994874 They are so disgusting.
1318782604104011776 2020-10-21 13:14:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AmberX994874 @Ian_walton1 I think he is ok.
1318717017042481152 2020-10-21 08:53:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @stillgray This guy needs a medical intervention.
1318659741833256960 2020-10-21 05:05:56 +0800 <bluesjack42> @imatriarch @realDonaldTrump Much more important asking Biden what flavor ice cream he got. Instead of reporters going to these announcements maybe ask real people who appreciate reforms made to help Americans.
1318654649780482049 2020-10-21 04:45:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Fatbob2013 More like an arrogant dictator.
1318653019399933954 2020-10-21 04:39:13 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DrRonBaumann @macsween_prue Assault will probably mean less jail time.
1318652501759987713 2020-10-21 04:37:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @macsween_prue If this person were to reoffend this judge needs to suffer some consequences.
1318652028629913600 2020-10-21 04:35:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @OMGTheMess Could be anyone.
1318651553960525826 2020-10-21 04:33:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ACTBrigitte If the emails are proven legit. Yes he should be impeached or jailed if he has already handed the presidency to Harris.
1318640968086605824 2020-10-21 03:51:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @thehill @KamalaHarris She seems to find everything funny.
1318535026452041728 2020-10-20 20:50:22 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden You couldn’t be more in the past if you tried.
1318371279783698433 2020-10-20 09:59:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @realDonaldTrump @GodCountryFami6 Meanwhile trump on the campaign trail. Biden hiding in the basement.
1318370093483532288 2020-10-20 09:54:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealBasedMAGA Well just to state the obvious sometimes .. no I won’t go there.
1318369430234046464 2020-10-20 09:52:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DrRonBaumann @macsween_prue You idiot. She is obviously trying to make people aware(me included) about what is happening with the court system.

1318361170785398784 2020-10-20 09:19:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden You are actually as weak as you know what.

1318319128126451712 2020-10-20 06:32:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LaborIsTrash Andrews overstepped the line when he said just a liberal. He insulted half the Australian population.

1318313365094109184 2020-10-20 06:09:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @_Byron____ Omg. I really think I am going to be sick.
1318312087836184577 2020-10-20 06:04:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @joannamrod @DGPurser How can you get a candidate across the line? He should only win if he is voted in. This sounds suspicious.
1318310445132832768 2020-10-20 05:57:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @realDonaldTrump @jjauthor Meanwhile trump is doing what a president does.

1318306644090966016 2020-10-20 05:42:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MAGAshop2020 Well they have had the laptop for a while &amp; nothing seem to have been done.
1318305986822590465 2020-10-20 05:40:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @whatgives1313 Maybe someone guilty &amp; not wanting to maybe answer a hard question.
1318305214722568193 2020-10-20 05:37:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @adv_australia I think it might be because trump supporters might feel safe amongst like minded in the huge crowds but not safe any other time. Who would blame them when you see the vitriol &amp; violence directed at them &amp; their families.
1318302412558405632 2020-10-20 05:26:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @dcexaminer @IvyFoliage @QuinHillyer @JoeBiden Exactly. The bottom line here is that this seem to have been kept from the American public in order to get Biden elected president.
1318299961964916736 2020-10-20 05:16:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MarkSaunders26 That just shows what he thinks of half his  Victorians. What an arrogant poor leader.
1318174267423379456 2020-10-19 20:56:50 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EricMMatheny You could be right.

1318170998814896128 2020-10-19 20:43:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @J_C_Campbell Omg is he for real.
1318032088646316032 2020-10-19 11:31:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealJamesWoods @waynes21 So some obvious bias.

1317968491438206976 2020-10-19 07:19:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AskSweetThing No I won’t say what I really think it’s not worth being banned for that.
1317965198716661760 2020-10-19 07:06:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kidztrix @RudyGiuliani I think people do give a damn if joe Biden was involved after saying he wasn’t. If he compromised USA by being open to being blackmailed while VP &amp; if he was elected president.
1317962848379699201 2020-10-19 06:56:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DistilledSpiri1 @NolteNC Problem here seems he helped his son but also himself apparently. Investigations need to start to find the truth.
1317962121875877888 2020-10-19 06:53:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AdamInHTownTX @NolteNC True that makes sense.
1317962002740883456 2020-10-19 06:53:22 +0800 <bluesjack42> @NolteNC @JoeFreedomLove I agree. Everyone knows hunter had drug problems but let’s stick to joe Biden’s lies &amp; whether he put USA at risk by taking money from a foreign power.
1317957970932629504 2020-10-19 06:37:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @1BLUEWAVE2020 @JoeBiden One would retire not so gracefully.

1317948320023670784 2020-10-19 05:59:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @waldowns @826Maureen @MrKRudd Yes for once I agree.

1317937217675821056 2020-10-19 05:14:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealOmarNavarro No.
1317933744880197632 2020-10-19 05:01:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @toddstarnes This is also a man who donates his salary to different causes. Grow up not many of us have actual money on us now.

1317787510190206977 2020-10-18 19:20:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DamTom79 I actually think Rudd is losing it.
1317780948092514304 2020-10-18 18:53:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @NickAdamsinUSA @2112Frankie Hard to say anything positive about Biden.
1317699057893081089 2020-10-18 13:28:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DrShayPhD Sorry can’t be bothered. Just too many.

1317678922750808064 2020-10-18 12:08:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @goodfoodgal I think it already is. Really did you see the bunch who people voted in to lead NZ.

1317668593627099137 2020-10-18 11:27:28 +0800 <bluesjack42> @nearlydenzil @phl43 Still insane.

1317627283172028416 2020-10-18 08:43:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AdamBandt @ShaneRattenbury They voted left bc they are mostly public servants maybe.
1317583527890747393 2020-10-18 05:49:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CBSNews Biden can’t even pronounce his running mates name.
1317582990139027456 2020-10-18 05:47:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HowleyReporter It was obvious they were going to take out Biden on the grounds of ill health. He won’t have to answer for crimes committed &amp; you will have a far leftie with another far leftie running the country if Biden wins.
1317582036857626624 2020-10-18 05:43:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Stevemcbricho I hope Geelong can beat Richmond. I am a crows fan but will definitely be going for the cats.

1317427448246489089 2020-10-17 19:29:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @joe_warmington Maybe people watched hoping they grilled Biden on hunter Biden. Also no one could listen to that appalling person screeching at trump.

1317404631081758720 2020-10-17 17:58:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @netz_melb Fancy having that power over millions . I honestly think he enjoys it.
1317290569366818816 2020-10-17 10:25:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PierreAtlas @cnnbrk It was all about whether they would have the guts to ask Biden about his son. Plus who could stand that dreadful woman screeching at trump.
1317280853936934912 2020-10-17 09:46:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @realRyanTBoyd @SpeakerPelosi You are just trying to destroy the economy hoping it will destroy trump.  But I think people see through this.

1317205535003824128 2020-10-17 04:47:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JackHKimber Same here.

1317200952584097792 2020-10-17 04:29:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BreitbartNews We don’t want him.
1317198657796542464 2020-10-17 04:20:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @dbongino So happy for you.
1317198060204683270 2020-10-17 04:17:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @marklutchman Do these people think oh if I say I’m going to leave USA no one will vote for trump. No one cares you twats.
1317197370673623040 2020-10-17 04:15:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @dbongino As long as it’s not Australia.
1317197116125573120 2020-10-17 04:13:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HeatherIAm23 Deranged.
1317083999915761671 2020-10-16 20:44:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SSludgeworth Tucker is becoming the only person I believe.
1317070978594209792 2020-10-16 19:52:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ACTBrigitte The worst.
1317070707981832193 2020-10-16 19:51:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PeteButtigieg What does that even mean???
1317068044447875073 2020-10-16 19:41:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @philkaiba I’m a crows supporter but I feel sorry for port.
1317067817938690048 2020-10-16 19:40:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @philkaiba Something needs to done about holding the ball.
1317066920911204352 2020-10-16 19:36:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Jim_Jordan Dead heat.
1317064664174391296 2020-10-16 19:27:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AusAntiLeft I don’t think I could dislike an AFL team more. The umpires need to get a handle on the holding the ball it is just ridiculous. Hope the flogs don’t win. Go Geelong or lions.
1317063417279123457 2020-10-16 19:22:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Hoosiers1986 Not just politics but the world as a whole.

1317016478365831168 2020-10-16 16:16:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TheJordanRachel Maybe what happens when on drugs.
1317016126283423744 2020-10-16 16:14:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @theheraldsun Good. Hopefully the truth will come out.

1316489406501416962 2020-10-15 05:21:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BarrettWilson6 @CHPoindexterIII Fantastic hypothetical question &amp; equally great answer,
1316487425326161920 2020-10-15 05:13:56 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JackPosobiec You can call a lid but eventually you can’t hide.
1316486375844110337 2020-10-15 05:09:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @abcnews What has rain which does happen, has happened got to do with the climate change theory.???
1316484604254068736 2020-10-15 05:02:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BawdenSnoek This is not acceptable but is what could happen when people are suffering.
1316474053524221952 2020-10-15 04:20:47 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HoggcastM @dbongino What a good man talking about what is happening in his town. They burn , loot &amp; destroy without the thought of lives they may be ruining. Black white  any lives of people who just want to look after their families in safety. This is what is happening.
1316352540032655366 2020-10-14 20:17:56 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MTpointguard @CDW83828995 @RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump To be fair he has no idea what day of the week it is.
1316345909253292034 2020-10-14 19:51:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @surfbird03 This is what happens when you vote in a dictator.
1316345275162660866 2020-10-14 19:49:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JackPosobiec It’s embarrassing.
1316344558469275649 2020-10-14 19:46:13 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AussieVal10 He is like a condescending parent letting the kids have another hour of playtime.  He is so arrogant I don’t know how you Victorians stand it.
1316343468424216577 2020-10-14 19:41:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AussieVal10 You can see he loves  the power. No empathy but this control over millions of people’s lives. It seems to be a real high for him. So sad.

1316338425159536640 2020-10-14 19:21:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @charliekirk11 In a nutshell.
1316337716645167104 2020-10-14 19:19:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JuliansRum I just want to see justice for Benghazi &amp; for the families who Hillary Clinton said what does it matter now. Hope these people will face treason charges.
1316334146847793152 2020-10-14 19:04:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ExposeTheMedia Is there anyone more out of touch or selfish than this woman.
1316331462526812162 2020-10-14 18:54:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JuliansRum @emilygirl3 Hope we will finally see justice for the families of these brave Americans.
1316330536223166465 2020-10-14 18:50:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden Have you heard the latest on Benghazi mate. I hope all you involved in that treason committed against your fellow Americans will finally be revealed.
1316294712916021249 2020-10-14 16:28:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @hrenee80 No.
1316293950404132867 2020-10-14 16:25:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TrumpJew What is wrong with her. She looks weird.

1316290676141645826 2020-10-14 16:12:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @jostephan @Qtah17 Maybe they are waiting for a left wing government.
1316280893607034880 2020-10-14 15:33:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @davidmatheson27 What a true statement.
1316279254196207616 2020-10-14 15:26:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EricTrump @JaggerMickOZ You would want to say back at you.
1316274400799252480 2020-10-14 15:07:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @stillgray There are lots nearly worse.

1316151534963445760 2020-10-14 06:59:13 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TheSharpEdge1 She is in a different league to the one asking the questions.
1316147912649240576 2020-10-14 06:44:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @deray All black people, all white people do not necessarily think the same. This is the problem of judging people by color or race.
1316143144543555585 2020-10-14 06:25:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RobertEvans1953 @yogagenie @realDonaldTrump From Australia ,why do you have to register as a Democrat or a republican? Surely who you vote for is private. No one knows officially who I vote for.
1316099533533712384 2020-10-14 03:32:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @GrumpyOLSoldier I heard him referring to that. What could go wrong?
1316057432997556226 2020-10-14 00:45:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @r_g_9_2019 @QTAnon1 @JoeBiden You are nuts.
1316057110732443648 2020-10-14 00:44:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden No you need an opposition that accepts an election result &amp; doesn’t incite violence.
1315794414816563201 2020-10-13 07:20:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CattHarmony @pam_sands They would probably remember him being there.
1315793232278642690 2020-10-13 07:15:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @margmopp @bill_dobell Why didn’t any of you so called journalists ask the tough questions &amp; keep asking until you get an honest answer. Not I can’t remember. Even you lot must think that is complete bs.
1315789024846462976 2020-10-13 06:58:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @paulsperry_ No surprise when Biden is clearly struggling to remember what state he is in or what position he is running for. Pretty sad really.
1315788623514537984 2020-10-13 06:57:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @McKaylaRoseJ Probably not. But normal people do not accept violence , hate &amp; just want a safe life for themselves &amp; their families.
1315783062689468416 2020-10-13 06:35:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @margmopp It was refreshing to see someone ask the questions that I’m sure a lot of Victorians want to know the answers. I’m sure you are not disputing her questions Carlton. Instead of arrogance we finally saw Andrews stumbling.
1315779370485575681 2020-10-13 06:20:22 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Love4PoliceDogs @DCTFTW Stunning dog.
1315778005784883200 2020-10-13 06:14:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @saffronhowden The fact she is not a journalist seems to mean she actually reports &amp; pursues the facts.
1315774159264202752 2020-10-13 05:59:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PhilHillman1 @JohnF135 That would be the top four.

1315629126171021312 2020-10-12 20:23:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @FoxNews Why doesn’t pelosi just retire gracefully. She looks tired &amp; haggard. Hate is not good for anyone,

1315485790797922304 2020-10-12 10:53:47 +0800 <bluesjack42> @bossjr450 @MelodyMac51 The cost of vandalism is shared by all taxpayers. Ok for those not working or paying tax. Scum.
1315485360646889474 2020-10-12 10:52:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MelodyMac51 These people only know about violence. Disgusting.

1315434028044967937 2020-10-12 07:28:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SenKamalaHarris If they wear masks &amp; it is 2 weeks, there is also social distancing.
1315405730522951681 2020-10-12 05:35:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RepStevenSmith @RealJamesWoods A visit from the police.

1315399779690577920 2020-10-12 05:12:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mskellymac007 @emilygirl3 He has made himself &amp; his family quite wealthy.

1315394842122305536 2020-10-12 04:52:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @GrumpyOLSoldier Well Tim flannery the master of predicting no rain is still the darling of the left.

1315386511647363073 2020-10-12 04:19:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BuzzPatterson Why would anyone care when these people threaten to leave America. Does it affect anyone’s life? No, off you go.
1315384352470036480 2020-10-12 04:10:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @McKaylaRoseJ Some know what socialism is like. That’s why they came to USA.
1315382619014533120 2020-10-12 04:03:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @tinka133 It is pretty obvious.
1315381904418328577 2020-10-12 04:00:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @GrumpyOLSoldier He should have included Andrews.
1315378399964139520 2020-10-12 03:47:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HeatherIAm23 They have to keep him hidden.
1315259828365713408 2020-10-11 19:55:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @netz_melb I think he has lost his marbles.
1315258740396883971 2020-10-11 19:51:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews Does she ever stop whingeing?
1315216207889358848 2020-10-11 17:02:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @NKrankie No surprise.
1315215221900754944 2020-10-11 16:58:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @thehill I was hoping she was back in school, spending her money &amp; not getting involved in stuff her parents got her into.

1315136572618989568 2020-10-11 11:46:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews Complete madness going on in Victoria &amp; some people still defending him.

1315126975887929344 2020-10-11 11:07:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CCAletatruth @gatewaypundit Does Biden even realize there is no one there except his staff.
1315125241383809025 2020-10-11 11:01:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RubyRockstar333 Omg. This is getting more ridiculous &amp; horrific by the day. Please let it stop.
1315122874366095361 2020-10-11 10:51:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ACTBrigitte Yes i believe trump supporters would not answer for fear of being targeted with violence. This is happening.
1315122006656905217 2020-10-11 10:48:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @conservative245 Please get elected, even in Australia we are depending on a stable conservative USA. Try &amp; hold your temper even though it is so disgusting the way you have been treated.

1315052892831641602 2020-10-11 06:13:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @damiantardio When Andrews talks it is without empathy or compassion. It’s quite disturbing.
1315052479147466752 2020-10-11 06:11:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @j_man333 @DanielAndrewsMP Voted left.

1315022582337339392 2020-10-11 04:13:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BridgetVallence Does anyone think that it is time to celebrate anything the labor party has forced on Victoria,? They just don’t get it.
1315020681336090624 2020-10-11 04:05:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RossFairchild His movies have been crap lately so I have stopped watching anyway.
1314895201517727744 2020-10-10 19:47:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrKRudd Oh go away.
1314791655942234113 2020-10-10 12:55:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kittycatsforme @lou_lou1958 Depends who the case is. If it was someone responsible who was isolating as much as possible, getting checked when symptoms appear &amp; providing any contacts. Should be ok. If it is not then you are stuffed.
1314790952960098305 2020-10-10 12:52:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @WooSpry @lou_lou1958 Angry is the word I would use.
1314790657123184640 2020-10-10 12:51:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @lou_lou1958 How can you stand the arrogance of this dictator?
1314790366244077572 2020-10-10 12:50:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SexCounseling Getting very worried.
1314788507362103296 2020-10-10 12:43:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ACTBrigitte If she is proven guilty yes. Why not it’s what happens to people who commit crimes. Or should.
1314718687169925120 2020-10-10 08:05:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CHIZMAGA I am too.
1314717955733692417 2020-10-10 08:02:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @edwinesberiop @1776Stonewall Maybe should have done it years ago
1314717421370896385 2020-10-10 08:00:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @1776Stonewall Why???
1314717234216923136 2020-10-10 07:59:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @netz_melb Maybe the test for leaders in Australia should be to have a good memory. Or be truthful.
1314715983911686145 2020-10-10 07:54:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @zach4vikings No. Just how passionate he is &amp; frustrated at the lack of justic.
1314690080213135362 2020-10-10 06:11:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust @jenijeni1 This is Queensland under labor.
1314688584922800128 2020-10-10 06:05:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealJamesWoods @BeanK511 It’s getting ridiculous this farce. The poor man has cognitive decline &amp; is being used as a prop. Someone needs to step in now. He needs medical assessment without the help of a teleprompter. Now.
1314687715397394432 2020-10-10 06:02:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @sofaspu37 @sheila06942158 @debates The moderators should go. They asked biased questions &amp; ad. Nothing to debates.
1314687427739480066 2020-10-10 06:01:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HbAlpaca @QLDLabor @OneNationAus How can anyone vote for people that allow special treatment for the rich &amp; shameless but not the average joe.
1314686642574163968 2020-10-10 05:58:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TPDMomof3 @CitizenFreePres How do you know she is not running when Biden is relieved of his duties.
1314686060010430470 2020-10-10 05:55:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CitizenFreePres @FredGeorg2 I hope there are few sleepless nights in a certain household. Retribution for the pain caused for many families she has harmed.
1314680676185063424 2020-10-10 05:34:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @crsphilly @crazyprofessor Hurry up.
1314680247925657600 2020-10-10 05:32:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @0_politics2 @rentonMagaUK She is on drugs.
1314679939778580482 2020-10-10 05:31:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @teacherfortrump @stevwgn7 It is a complete farce. You should do better America.
1314678775360053249 2020-10-10 05:27:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrMichaelBurkes What is she even doing there????
1314676429972332544 2020-10-10 05:17:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RudyGiuliani @j_ankrom We know it now. Not good.
1314674933985755136 2020-10-10 05:11:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Dean90066 So he should.
1314674387216334849 2020-10-10 05:09:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DavidLimbaugh @NevadaJack2 She really needs a medical check up. At first it seemed funny &amp; you could show clips of her rants &amp; craziness, but now it’s getting out of control. She is not fit for her position as the third in power in the USA.
1314672123256827904 2020-10-10 05:00:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CindyProUSA @j_ankrom That’s because she is all of those things. You can’t fool all of the people,
1314669440940687360 2020-10-10 04:49:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ACCIONA_AU It would have been a stunning image without the bird killing man made machines.
1314665057599414272 2020-10-10 04:32:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @joehoft @RepStevenSmith @realDonaldTrump @gatewaypundit This man is dangerous.
1314664495042633729 2020-10-10 04:30:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @FOXLA @BeanK511 Obviously a corrupt biased postal worker can see it is a mail in vote. What could go wrong ?
1314663936021602304 2020-10-10 04:28:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @FOXLA @BeanK511 I don’t understand how in a country like the USA you allow voter fraud.
1314663380825772032 2020-10-10 04:25:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @dorko57 @7AFL @Toyota_Aus We have started turning off the sound. I’m sorry but Daisy has not got a voice for commentary. Plus last night Richmond showed us the worst side of sportsmanship, mostly from the captain &amp; serial offender lynch.
1314659309016371200 2020-10-10 04:09:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @toddstarnes You can’t do anything or you will be arrested. Many people have for trying to save their lives or property, while the so called peaceful protestors are released or not even charged.
1314658381295054849 2020-10-10 04:05:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @whatgives1313 No words.
1314557227332583424 2020-10-09 21:24:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @FOXFOOTY @tommorris32 I don’t like the way Richmond play the game. That incident was deliberate &amp; something a flog would do.
1314556284373405696 2020-10-09 21:20:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @k11s__ All I know is the game of AFL is sorrier for the way Richmond play the game. Some of their players are spiteful &amp; in my opinion don’t play in the spirit of the game.
1314524398150328320 2020-10-09 19:13:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Richmond_FC I hope port beat you &amp; I don’t even like port. Lynch needs to be rubbed out for the game. Tigers always have to play dirty.
1314466088126611457 2020-10-09 15:21:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @theheraldsun In other words don’t believe a word he says.
1314465453931020288 2020-10-09 15:19:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SJPFISH Who is she. Why would anyone want to see her whoever she is.
1314420337946181632 2020-10-09 12:20:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AngCooperman @WelllDoYou Unbelievable.
1314415908031401984 2020-10-09 12:02:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MajorPatriot Brilliant.
1314415465586802690 2020-10-09 12:00:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @toddstarnes Even with the obvious help from the moderator Kamala lost the plot. If she ever had it.
1314414750667698178 2020-10-09 11:57:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @OMGTheMess I am so worried about lack of power when we no longer use coal. All around the world especially third world countries are building coal powered electricity. We will end up being a third world country, with no manufacturing, no jobs or future.
1314413358536245248 2020-10-09 11:52:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LisaMarieBoothe She is unlike able bc she lies, pulls childish faces &amp; is so far left she cannot be a leader of USA
1314412716765839361 2020-10-09 11:49:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @geeksrulz @StiofanDonnelly You wish.
1314412376846864385 2020-10-09 11:48:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @StiofanDonnelly I would think anyone would want to know about a 6 minute conversation which seemed to change who they employed to supervise the lockdown.
1314364404842913792 2020-10-09 08:37:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden Who did he plagiarize that platitude from?
1314363036275105792 2020-10-09 08:32:22 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kelliekelly23 @StTezza @gatewaypundit Hate can destroy your ability to think clearly. Pelosi prime example.
1314362091621421056 2020-10-09 08:28:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JulianBurnside @ScottMorrisonMP Maybe heard that response before.
1314361115032186880 2020-10-09 08:24:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Breaking911 The only ones that are sick are pelosi &amp; Biden.
1314360528861425664 2020-10-09 08:22:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DrBiden Maybe perfect for your lot. Lying .
1314359140811067392 2020-10-09 08:16:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Did you even understand what was going on?
1314358485270720512 2020-10-09 08:14:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @netz_melb I think everyone knows that but good to hear from someone who was in the know.
1314320271264817153 2020-10-09 05:42:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Vintagedrummer7 This should be played everyday
1314318213811847170 2020-10-09 05:34:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KeiraSavage00 Poor Gary if only he was rich &amp; famous. These people are hideous. I hope there is someone with an ounce of empathy who will let this man have his last days surrounded by family.
1314317185410502656 2020-10-09 05:30:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Hoosiers1986 @KamalaHarris Did she ever tell the truth?
1314316780047757312 2020-10-09 05:28:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @chant_ian @ellymelly @clementine_ford She is so not funny, nice just really horrible.
1314315653260611584 2020-10-09 05:24:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Kate18660449 Everything he said was true &amp; to the point. He could have said a lot more.
1314309685479010305 2020-10-09 05:00:22 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TrumpLadyFran No. Look at that smart face.
1314308984220729345 2020-10-09 04:57:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @itskylefife Biden will never be president. He has dementia. They would be voting for Harris.
1314308331272507392 2020-10-09 04:54:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Deefadog4me Nobody cares.
1314305891047337984 2020-10-09 04:45:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealJamesWoods @angelsbelle The scary thing is when Biden obviously will not be be able to fulfill his presidential duties if elected, Harris will be president of the USA. I almost feel sorry for her. She is not up to the job apart from being a extreme lefty she is a proven liar.
1314298831106793472 2020-10-09 04:17:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HillaryClinton As far as I know trump did not delete thousands of emails to cover crimes, let fellow Americans die in Benghazi after being tortured &amp; did not have a family member involved with Jeffrey Epstein. Just saying
1314294345575526401 2020-10-09 03:59:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JulianBurnside @ScottMorrisonMP No but then I don’t think anything you say is true.
1314165558896594944 2020-10-08 19:27:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JacquiLambie You always come across as angry &amp; bitter.
1314148422090285058 2020-10-08 18:19:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealJamesWoods The scenario sounds scary.
1314117886391197697 2020-10-08 16:18:13 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealJamesWoods No you are right.
1314115125905747969 2020-10-08 16:07:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @britishbullybee @RupertScott21 Hmm is that a threat or promise.
1314113999852630016 2020-10-08 16:02:47 +0800 <bluesjack42> @InfinityTimesMe @Josieamycashman Sorry I didn’t mean anyone without children don’t have empathy but in her case I just think she shows a lack of compassion, but if she had children she might just feel something for those suffering.
1314110530009743360 2020-10-08 15:49:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @captnwentworth @docMJP I couldn’t have said it better.
1314110156121104384 2020-10-08 15:47:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @docMJP We had to turn off. The lies were disgusting.
1314109465520611328 2020-10-08 15:44:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @VeronicaMK5 @shellsncheezzz She is very angry all the time. Whingeing.
1314109048741011456 2020-10-08 15:43:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @shellsncheezzz I agree.
1314106562978275330 2020-10-08 15:33:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SamDavi99667843 I would rather poke my eyes out.
1314106390089068545 2020-10-08 15:32:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Josieamycashman No empathy. I checked whether she had children &amp; realized that was the problem. I feel for her but shows why she is so cold.
1314091803964968960 2020-10-08 14:34:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CHIZMAGA No when using the word like able. No can’t do it.
1314042644612304897 2020-10-08 11:19:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BoSnerdley Had to turn off. It was nauseating watching her lie.
1313970786303049729 2020-10-08 06:33:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @benshapiro Yes Harris is scared to divulge her far left policies &amp; Biden has none.
1313968612386861056 2020-10-08 06:25:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealJamesWoods She is totally evil.
1313968028162301952 2020-10-08 06:22:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @paulsperry_ Can you impeach before becoming president?
1313967826768601090 2020-10-08 06:21:56 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TweetCorrineB You think????

1313961990826545154 2020-10-08 05:58:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @charliekulyrwah I must admit I don’t see anyone even wearing masks, I live in south Australia.We have been lucky with very limited COVID cases.
1313960582853259265 2020-10-08 05:53:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TeamTrump That sounds like none of her business.
1313952100070506497 2020-10-08 05:19:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @joshdcaplan How many people are getting away with this?
1313951614810484736 2020-10-08 05:17:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @seanhannity People don’t like opinions forced on them. They just want to watch a good game of football.
1313950995316056064 2020-10-08 05:15:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump Polls are rarely right, even in Australia the left labor leader was so confident he told Arnie Schwarzenegger he was going to be the next PM of Australia. All the polls showed him winning but he didn’t.
1313944414469799936 2020-10-08 04:48:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @dbongino Hoping everything all ok. You have support from Australia. Americans need strong patriots like you.

1313685684494852096 2020-10-07 11:40:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden Your word means nothing. You have lied &amp; lied.
1313685501644165121 2020-10-07 11:40:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden How can you when supported by violence. You never say how just pointless platitudes.

1313387518331555842 2020-10-06 15:56:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @worldoracle @DanielAndrewsMP You could be right.

1313234363820109825 2020-10-06 05:47:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MajorPatriot @K1er It is definitely suspicious.
1313224167769038849 2020-10-06 05:06:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @robsmithonline He just doesn’t get it. Doesn’t understand what is racist &amp; this person wants to be president.
1313217421738606592 2020-10-06 04:40:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @imatriarch @robbystarbuck This is probably top of the list that trump has done.
1313207448719638528 2020-10-06 04:00:28 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HLiedown That is a great chicken coop.
1313206316660269056 2020-10-06 03:55:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Sainter_35 He really is a dictator.
1313205195153657857 2020-10-06 03:51:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @couriermail This person should not hold a position of power.
1313203908328579072 2020-10-06 03:46:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeyCawbs Why can’t we have both.
1313090280636084227 2020-10-05 20:14:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @doctorcherokee @schunapa @Wenpachter @LeslieM3355 @JohnJHarwood If that had been my daughter I would have smacked him one. It’s not normal just creepy.
1312928228990803968 2020-10-05 09:30:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Fatbob2013 Agree totally
1312888884875808768 2020-10-05 06:54:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JohnRuddick2 Even his dog is bored.
1312887750136217601 2020-10-05 06:50:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JRubinBlogger Yes
1312881231780962304 2020-10-05 06:24:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Lazza66744399 What is his problem? He is a very bitter person.
1312873376533291008 2020-10-05 05:52:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @VicLNPOxide @DavidDavisMLC @Tim_jbo @BuggaThe @rachelbaxendale It’s not a question of what leader &amp; their politics. Andrews is the premier of Victoria &amp; so far has not taken responsibility by using the old I can’t remember trick.
1312872187422937090 2020-10-05 05:48:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Tim_jbo @rachelbaxendale Love hearing real journalism holding leaders to account or at least trying to.
1312737837410783237 2020-10-04 20:54:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ElijahSchaffer @KatieDaviscourt Nothing to see here just an idea.
1312735818402783239 2020-10-04 20:46:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @hooksbaited This one is really annoying. Whingeing.
1312733223516954624 2020-10-04 20:36:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Ek7_PRN Probably not but you never know. There are some dangerous people out there.
1312732301428621312 2020-10-04 20:32:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @netz_melb That was the worst. That alone could lose an election, but there was lots of other cringeworthy moments.
1312678748957757440 2020-10-04 16:59:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden @DrBiden Actually she should be ashamed of not protecting her husband.
1312678023859073026 2020-10-04 16:56:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @wdunlap @KamalaHarris No
1312677544504643586 2020-10-04 16:54:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden Do what? You really can’t do anything.
1312513162038583296 2020-10-04 06:01:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @jaf_angel I can’t vote but I chose trump anyway.
1312512875177492480 2020-10-04 06:00:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @cjtjgeol He is unbelievable &amp; not in good way.
1312508507099283457 2020-10-04 05:43:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @liquidlaugh @PhilMcCrackin44 Even lower.
1312508074926641152 2020-10-04 05:41:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kelliekelly23 Looks like the war zone it is.
1312507535325159424 2020-10-04 05:39:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RodS108443078 @StevenJMiles He seems quite unbalanced.
1312505601323278336 2020-10-04 05:31:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @NotSoProudYank @djthefunkchris @thehill So what??
1312505425191866368 2020-10-04 05:30:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @thehill Does she really think anyone cares.???
1312504670275866624 2020-10-04 05:27:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DearAuntCrabby This proves that college teaches you some hateful things &amp; trump is for the hardworking families of America.
1312500463565115392 2020-10-04 05:11:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @joshdcaplan It really doesn’t matter I guess she doesn’t seem to do anything.
1312497265789992961 2020-10-04 04:58:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LadyRedWave Nothing would surprise me.
1312496575189381120 2020-10-04 04:55:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @StephenKing @GovChristie @maddow You are just a dipshit.

1312328874378752000 2020-10-03 17:49:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @gr8tjude_08 @RealCandaceO Must be true.
1312328540994510848 2020-10-03 17:48:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @iliasofjohn @DanielAndrewsMP @Joe_Hildebrand This is what happens when you fail your state.
1312327559963537410 2020-10-03 17:44:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Fatbob2013 @AlboMP Who are the 27%?
1312327197407891462 2020-10-03 17:42:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Porter02S @Smith13Nat @catturd2 I am even worried in Australia.
1312325448366391296 2020-10-03 17:35:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ABC It sounds nice but somehow I don’t really believe you.
1312300827470688257 2020-10-03 15:57:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Hoosiers1986 Well the dems are even more left than the communists. Nasty lot too.
1312300370828226565 2020-10-03 15:56:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @826Maureen @RealJamesWoods @Riogallica @TomArnold You are being too kind.
1312297432110170112 2020-10-03 15:44:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ChuckCallesto Now ffs.
1312296897298591744 2020-10-03 15:42:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden Such obvious comments that mean zilch.
1312276411604819968 2020-10-03 14:20:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Acosta Can’t you read?? How many times has he condemned supremists of any persuasion, you obviously are a moron. Just on Twitter there are many examples. Having heard you condemn violent protests.
1312275417617711104 2020-10-03 14:16:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews Those two are actually making everything worse by their moronic platitudes. Go &amp; live your own lives &amp; leave politics to people who at least might have some idea of politics.
1312273312265826304 2020-10-03 14:08:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @suren_senat Really who cares?
1312273142929268736 2020-10-03 14:07:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JackPosobiec I think the drugs have not been good for her.

1312272392677277697 2020-10-03 14:04:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @theheraldsun Thank good we never heard about it.
1312271985980792832 2020-10-03 14:03:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Peter217945 @davidmatheson27 I thought Philip Adams was no longer.
1312263019649396736 2020-10-03 13:27:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AmyMek @POTUS Sounds like a nice American patriot . Not.
1312262761540284416 2020-10-03 13:26:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DailyCaller What the hell is he talking about???
1312262371549700096 2020-10-03 13:25:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @WashTimes There are some ghastly people in the world. How do they live with themselves. Much as I dislike some of the high ranking dems like pelosi &amp; Clinton I would not wish them harm just deserved justice for crimes.
1312255713331171330 2020-10-03 12:58:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @unkljak1 @plbrocks @seanmdav @MMjustified Really??
1312250244986331136 2020-10-03 12:36:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealJamesWoods @donaldrusso994 So what part of failing a drug test(taking drugs) &amp; then being discharged from the military is not true Biden. Just constant lies.
1312245366574604288 2020-10-03 12:17:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DavidG528 @TravisAllen02 @JeffreyLuscombe Oh really shut up.
1312190872096653315 2020-10-03 08:40:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Phil_Lewis_ Well they should be suspending a lot of them.
1312189550630825984 2020-10-03 08:35:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TheRISEofROD @Q_101_X Say what you mean. I think lots of people are with you on this.
1312187668046856192 2020-10-03 08:28:13 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ajcdeane Hope she had been banned.
1312058458460495873 2020-10-02 23:54:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RyanAFournier They should
1312019403018432513 2020-10-02 21:19:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @exojpa @soloyochapin @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @POTUS Biden has actually been in his basement for weeks.
1312012615204311042 2020-10-02 20:52:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JanineKaye4 I  like the chase but the English one is better with Bradley. Okeefe just over does it.
1311937636165054469 2020-10-02 15:54:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @marklutchman Sociopaths is a good word for these people.
1311894036748222465 2020-10-02 13:01:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KAG43210 @HillaryClinton If I was Clinton I would keep off Twitter. Just makes people angry.
1311893021550469120 2020-10-02 12:57:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RedBarnPatriot_ @HillaryClinton I will never forget this.
1311892338914938881 2020-10-02 12:54:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HillaryClinton These statements you make are just not true. Actually lies. What you did is the most in un-American thing I can think of. Benghazi, we won’t forget.
1311820945112223744 2020-10-02 08:11:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @buitengebieden_ Definitely the cat listening to a command is outstanding.
1311805055738146816 2020-10-02 07:07:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SteveScully @VP They look like buddies.
1311804838464770048 2020-10-02 07:07:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @1776Stonewall Maybe they don’t mind these obviously biased moderators bc they look biased &amp; people are not stupid &amp; will vote accordingly.
1311804395093331972 2020-10-02 07:05:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @1776Stonewall Unbiased. Not.
1311798207790292992 2020-10-02 06:40:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @cindievaccaro @ouchinagirl @Comey @FBI I know nothing seems to be the mantra of lefties when questioned.
1311796350695079937 2020-10-02 06:33:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealMattCouch I think that for most people the safety of their family,jobs &amp; their lives is top priority, when they see Biden not condemning antifa   &amp; the violence from mostly left groups, they are obviously worried &amp; will vote accordingly.
1311794453615505408 2020-10-02 06:25:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @leach_deanna @SLapprich Justice should be served to anyone. Do the crime do the time.
1311787624764379136 2020-10-02 05:58:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @VincentCrypt46 @Rochelle33Q Did Biden denounce the violent groups like antifa. No he called it an idea.
1311785538731483136 2020-10-02 05:50:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @deenie7940 @BreitbartNews Well explained but the left have just once again put out wrong information.
1311784386346450944 2020-10-02 05:45:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @WilsonSaintCla1 @WhosFibbing @JohnBasham @JennaEllisEsq @RonColeman @FOOL_NELSON @GreggJarrett @DonaldJTrumpJr @LLinWood @RepMattGaetz @ProfMJCleveland @VicToensing @TaraLaRosa Do we have something like a national guard that can take over &amp; try &amp; bring back life as we knew it in Victoria.Something needs to be done or Victoria will be decimated.
1311783462274121728 2020-10-02 05:42:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MatthewGuyMP This was a complete debacle, but even worse 800 people died because of it. So far no one held to account.
1311782522372538368 2020-10-02 05:38:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DukeSelden @TonyPaul45 Even catchier.
1311782416185389056 2020-10-02 05:37:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TonyPaul45 Catchy.
1311781811538681856 2020-10-02 05:35:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PaulBateman3 I think the successful isolation of people with the virus, the testing &amp; then the tracking of contacts was lacking in Victoria. Victorians were definitely let down by their leaders.
1311778659192061952 2020-10-02 05:22:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Thomas1774Paine Looks like a charming place to live. Not.
1311776451729866752 2020-10-02 05:14:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RodS108443078 Always loved Barry. He is right we are lucky.

1311659657719545865 2020-10-01 21:30:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JohnRHewson You are the embarrassing one.
1311546965545549825 2020-10-01 14:02:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrAndyNgo @JackySinAZ That wonderful peaceful group.
1311455405285937157 2020-10-01 07:58:28 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TrumpWarRoom @JoeFreedomLove @KatyTurNBC Definitely make an ad with trump condemning all violence including kkk &amp; supremists of any persuasion.
1311452063100923905 2020-10-01 07:45:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @WestJournalism @JoeFreedomLove Hope he had been fired.
1311450494204747776 2020-10-01 07:38:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MichaelCoudrey Maybe should have played this at the debate &amp; asked for comments on this.
1311448338105999360 2020-10-01 07:30:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @copdoc1 Maybe not.
1311447984723255296 2020-10-01 07:28:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @1776Stonewall There was something going on.
1311283362170978306 2020-09-30 20:34:50 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Josieamycashman Never have or never will.
1311224688878649344 2020-09-30 16:41:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KatTheHammer1 Will never forget Benghazi.
1311214232138993665 2020-09-30 16:00:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @GemmaTognini @Beth_Alize Apparently not all together. They are so special.

1311196184195801088 2020-09-30 14:48:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @exrabb @charliekirk11 How do explain the difference when he is not wired &amp; stutters &amp; stumbles. Doesn’t know who is wife is, talks rubbish.
1311195212144766976 2020-09-30 14:44:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ARKITECHZ @charliekirk11 That would work. Rogan would give the hard questions. Not biased but fair.
1311194928429424640 2020-09-30 14:43:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @80sMetalGaga @charliekirk11 Carlson great , hannity talks too much.
1311194797705584641 2020-09-30 14:42:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @charliekirk11 @debbiehager7 Love it. He is Democrat who is fair.
1311193664740155393 2020-09-30 14:38:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mario05 @JennaEllisEsq People vote for him bc he isn’t presidential but someone working for the everyday American.
1311193288536334336 2020-09-30 14:36:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @12Lanzzz @JennaEllisEsq He did not attack his dead son he was talking about hunter the druggie who dies not support his kids.
1311161742437695488 2020-09-30 12:31:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust @JoeBiden What was he looking at all the time?
1311161260788953088 2020-09-30 12:29:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SBSNews He has previously denounced the white supremists who have caused trouble but not the label of white supremacy. Biden called antifa an idea not a organization even though it’s organized totally &amp; financially by some powerful lefties.

1311075661566472193 2020-09-30 06:49:30 +0800 <bluesjack42> @catherine___c Please show us that there is justice &amp; people who break the law, no matter who they are, will suffer some consequences.
1311070612454928384 2020-09-30 06:29:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CHIZMAGA Hopefully she had a more positive last wish, something about family &amp; loved ones.
1311070044923650048 2020-09-30 06:27:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @826Maureen @AlboMP This disgusting in times where people are dying from the virus. How vulnerable would they be without cancer medicines.
1311068964965867522 2020-09-30 06:22:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @VIM84437144 @macsween_prue About time. There are are charges that could be brought against surely.
1311060082122199041 2020-09-30 05:47:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @gip1972 @macsween_prue I think the most important thing here is Australians get their medicines which are sitting on the docks at the moment apparently.
1310749598130954240 2020-09-29 09:13:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CHIZMAGA Last I heard he was in Australia. Don’t know how he was allowed in but there you go.
1310722481905229825 2020-09-29 07:26:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HbAlpaca It’s obviously fake but some idiots will believe this. This poor woman is going to suffer from all this hate.
1310712343513325568 2020-09-29 06:45:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @andjustliketha6 Voting in the USA seems more corrupt than most 3rd countries. It is an embarrassment that your most important decision should be so trivialized.
1310710363407527936 2020-09-29 06:37:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @superbucks2050 @GaryDoucer @JoeBiden Three strokes &amp; they are allowing him to be put under this stress. Apart from the stress of suffering from dementia these people including his wife are not looking after his welfare.
1310709558289915906 2020-09-29 06:34:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RodS108443078 I think people have been fooled by Daniels smooth talking manner. The trouble is he has been found out. He has obviously not told the truth &amp; seems to be passing the buck while apologizing &amp; saying the buck stops with him.
1310704480329981952 2020-09-29 06:14:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DEPLORABLEREEG1 @WelllDoYou Maybe it was planned.
1310700335887822848 2020-09-29 05:58:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DrBiden @priceta34 The dems say all these little platitudes without any substance.
1310698433204768769 2020-09-29 05:50:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SiCk_DiAbLo @ernie_plumley @gatewaypundit I’m sure trump knew he wouldn’t. Looks suspicious though.
1310698074163929089 2020-09-29 05:49:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @noturbine @Forbes I guess you would have to accept say Harris &amp; whoever their VP is.
1310468869849362432 2020-09-28 14:38:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @netz_melb @plbrocks Like peas in a pod Dan &amp; jacinda.

1310460420948328448 2020-09-28 14:04:46 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DifficultNerd @DanielAndrewsMP I can’t believe he is still making comments.
1310459764195819520 2020-09-28 14:02:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TX_Bruce And we should care?? You also are a lousy actor.
1310459542673584128 2020-09-28 14:01:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @dave70731517 You are part of the problem. Your husband is incapable of making any decisions &amp; you &amp; the dems know it.
1310458490255634432 2020-09-28 13:57:05 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews This whole debacle not only affected Victoria but the whole of Australia. I would be furious if I was trying to run a business there. Just total incompetence.
1310456889075855360 2020-09-28 13:50:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Tom32397313 @Adelaide_FC Get rid of them, last thing we need is more trouble.
1310418844033245187 2020-09-28 11:19:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ChrisDJackson No because her name has the initials ACB. Really there are some thick people out there.
1310417542737846272 2020-09-28 11:14:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump No but I am interested in hunter Biden’s &amp; all the rest of the swamp.
1310417105058054146 2020-09-28 11:12:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AmberX994874 Tasteful but is it true?
1310349362426384384 2020-09-28 06:43:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @couriermail @BruhnRose Good hope these people receive penalties for endangering lives.

1310212634227044352 2020-09-27 21:40:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Breaking911 @eavesdropann It probably feels like 180years .

1310101772489220097 2020-09-27 14:19:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TNSociallyMissy I would vote no matter what.
1310101098938597377 2020-09-27 14:16:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @netz_melb I hope she does.
1310100872395857922 2020-09-27 14:16:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CHIZMAGA She is an even weaker candidate than biden.
1310100656972156928 2020-09-27 14:15:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KamalaHarris If you don’t agree with it, then people will support it.
1310078313411440643 2020-09-27 12:46:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kevincorke @ThomasWIttig3 I don’t think this will end well.
1310074920710418433 2020-09-27 12:32:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealMattCouch Virus.
1310074734885781505 2020-09-27 12:32:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CHIZMAGA Who cares.
1310074283020808192 2020-09-27 12:30:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ellymelly @ScottMorrisonMP I am beginning to agree.
1310073617212792835 2020-09-27 12:27:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HadnNuff @LadyRedWave They do act differently that’s the point.
1310009379500908545 2020-09-27 08:12:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LononKathy He seems to be an habitual liar. How can he be even considered a candidate for president apart from the fact he had dementia??
1310008078440345600 2020-09-27 08:07:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrKRudd Wanker. Couldn’t watch all of that but once again wanker.
1310007306076078080 2020-09-27 08:04:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EM_KA_17 Wow he really is a nasty psychopath.
1310006789514039297 2020-09-27 08:02:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EyesOnQ Why do people think that threatening to leave USA will mean anything to anyone. Off you go whoever you are.
1310004606953426944 2020-09-27 07:53:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews The only good thing about kevin07 is that in trivia questions it’s easy to remember when he was PM.
1310003070055505922 2020-09-27 07:47:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MeghanMcCain You seem very bitter.
1309999445992329216 2020-09-27 07:33:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden What shouldn’t be done &amp; what has always been done are 2 different things.
1309993863226880000 2020-09-27 07:10:50 +0800 <bluesjack42> @jonotabot_ Good. About time people were held to account.
1309984692398030849 2020-09-27 06:34:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @rn__deplorable @ewarren There is nothing peaceful about anything the dems do.
1309838499839762433 2020-09-26 20:53:28 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Tim_jbo Psychopathic tendencies. No empathy.
1309836500788412419 2020-09-26 20:45:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AdamGruer @jillastark Good comment.
1309835921290752000 2020-09-26 20:43:13 +0800 <bluesjack42> @jillastark I think this is his one talent. Just looking smug &amp; not answering the question.

1309731439701757954 2020-09-26 13:48:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @tanya_plibersek I agree with plibersek for once. Couldn’t have described shorten &amp; albo better myself.
1309730395735248896 2020-09-26 13:43:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @4goodgovt @TomElliott3AW Actually their incompetence made Victoria the basket case of Australia.
1309625528219922433 2020-09-26 06:47:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @junkpuppet69 Not a particular cat lover but OMG. They are really something.

1309619661097459712 2020-09-26 06:23:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JodyBelcher7 @countken1 This love fest between the dems &amp; the media is sickening.
1309618132487528448 2020-09-26 06:17:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ACTBrigitte In Australia we have Andrews the premier of Victoria.
1309616520016748544 2020-09-26 06:11:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Lazza66744399 These people are gross. No respect just violent nasty ignorant &amp; any other word to describe anarchists.
1309611290055204864 2020-09-26 05:50:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AndrewLoveUS @JanMareeSmith2 I can’t believe I admired him.
1309610936701837312 2020-09-26 05:49:13 +0800 <bluesjack42> @greg_price11 Are we going to see this farce exposed on msm now.
1309602505215541248 2020-09-26 05:15:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @9NewsAUS Why would he allow anyone to make a decision so important without his supervision? Slack as.
1309601644733018112 2020-09-26 05:12:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AlanBampton @InnesKay She will resign but probably end up with some cushy job somewhere for taking the fall.
1309601140980367360 2020-09-26 05:10:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MartianHollow @InnesKay Surely there is repercussions for being paid by taxpayers &amp; failing to do your job, which caused the death of more than 750 Australians. Knowing nothing should be a crime in itself.
1309600094178607104 2020-09-26 05:06:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @InnesKay Except I do not believe any of it.
1309598065565642752 2020-09-26 04:58:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Thomas1774Paine I think people just don’t like your anti American rants &amp; your support of Marxism &amp; violence.
1309596954867822592 2020-09-26 04:53:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Patrici15767099 Off you go then.
1309521375774687233 2020-09-25 23:53:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews I saw a very arrogant man getting very edgy about questions.
1309263703448018945 2020-09-25 06:49:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KamalaHarris Really. I feel sorry for any parent losing a child. I also feel sorry for the violence, the drug culture that both young people &amp; the police have to deal with everyday. Keep your children safe.
1309250274440011776 2020-09-25 05:56:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JackPosobiec @JoeFreedomLove Looks like a good crowd.
1309239793734221824 2020-09-25 05:14:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TrumpGirlOnFire @MelanieMetz6 They are easier targets that’s why. Peaceful as opposed to non peaceful.
1309238224707969029 2020-09-25 05:08:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @washingtonpost It happens in Australia otherwise the big cities in the most populated states would have the most power.
1309099652969623562 2020-09-24 19:57:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JordanBrace8 @KatTheHammer1 I know it’s a frightening picture but .
1309098849227726853 2020-09-24 19:54:22 +0800 <bluesjack42> @OMGTheMess @bill_dobell The fact that no one knew anything, should be enough to be sacked for that very reason.
1309093410024968204 2020-09-24 19:32:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Odi_sinistram Lost all respect for him.
1309092717272731649 2020-09-24 19:30:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Edwinsson @gerster_kaylene Very sad.
1309089769968799747 2020-09-24 19:18:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KingDrue17 @Gregory52594205 I would ask if he had any regrets putting himself in this chaos when he had a good life. I would thank him from Australia &amp; hope he survives for all western cultures.
1308915194278670336 2020-09-24 07:44:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JohnRuddick2 I love trump.

1308517706447028224 2020-09-23 05:25:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Redpilled9 So sad.
1308516282568830976 2020-09-23 05:19:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @worldoracle @DanielAndrewsMP Totally agree. Saw his arrogant comments yesterday.
1308512525558792193 2020-09-23 05:04:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PeterWallaceAU We can only hope the queen survives a few more years &amp; then at least William is king.
1308511681065050112 2020-09-23 05:01:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JohnRuddick2 Why wouldn’t he. Trump is the elected president. You apparently can’t have an odd number of justices, so as president he should pick the nominee.
1308204968692776960 2020-09-22 08:42:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ConservaMomUSA @ThomasWIttig3 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I believe the quiet non violent Americans will vote for trump.
1308202894382911490 2020-09-22 08:34:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Kate3015 Was the question also asked why they got to stage 4 restrictions, &amp; who is to blame for the farce that caused it.
1308169981821988864 2020-09-22 06:23:22 +0800 <bluesjack42> @joshdcaplan Reading all the tweets I would say people are sick of so called stars using these awards to say how woke they are while leading their lavish over the top lifestyles. Don’t patronize your customers they are smarter than you think.
1308168047698432000 2020-09-22 06:15:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @joshdcaplan Why would anyone watch a show to be lectured on who to vote for(as long as it’s left)&amp; how we should give up our lifestyle while they continue to live their lavish lifestyles. No way over it. Ricky Gervais said it all.
1308161005348728832 2020-09-22 05:47:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CHIZMAGA Oh please shut up.
1308151693994086400 2020-09-22 05:10:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @deenie7940 This farce would be funny if it wasn’t so sad.

1307895397877080065 2020-09-21 12:12:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TruthSeeker____ So no one thought all lives matter would be better &amp; not racist.
1307892818640121856 2020-09-21 12:02:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TitaniaMcGrath @margmopp I guess you don’t have 3 white people as friends. Probably no friends with your racist comments.
1307891597120475136 2020-09-21 11:57:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ChuckCallesto Why at the moment you are not running the country &amp; hopefully never will.
1307887910708944896 2020-09-21 11:42:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Jali_Cat I hope there is justice for these innocents.
1307886514391539714 2020-09-21 11:36:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @joshdcaplan @YohJudy Good start.

1307884243721138179 2020-09-21 11:27:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DKennedy1822 @HollySharp1111 @JoeBiden At least people still have sense of humor.
1307883635354136578 2020-09-21 11:25:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DKennedy1822 @HollySharp1111 @JoeBiden Not good with figures old joe.
1307883027565961219 2020-09-21 11:23:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @johnkeller17 @SaltyCracker9 He looks like president material. Not.
1307882787618189312 2020-09-21 11:22:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SaltyCracker9 @rentonMagaUK I was watching this &amp; then that nut job started with her hysteria.
1307882244824944640 2020-09-21 11:20:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SaltyCracker9 @rentonMagaUK @YouTube Do you think Ruth would approve of violence in her name.
1307881637003161600 2020-09-21 11:17:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SaltyCracker9 @rentonMagaUK @YouTube Hopefully the prisons have room for these criminals.
1307880206531584000 2020-09-21 11:11:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PRGuy17 Obviously joking???
1307879503692144649 2020-09-21 11:09:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @riktheozfrog @MRobertsQLD @browncoat5757 Great idea.
1307874866666725381 2020-09-21 10:50:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JosephGiardin14 Give someone else the chance to muck it up. Annoying he will just cruise into another high paid job.
1307863256929689601 2020-09-21 10:04:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SamDavi99667843 I guess they can see how a labor govt. with too much power eg victoria can act like dictators &amp; cause the pain &amp; suffering.
1307861076327899136 2020-09-21 09:55:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore No but to be fair haven’t watched that bs for 10years or more.
1307819420421558272 2020-09-21 07:10:22 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CharminUltra17 @Neen_Katzmann I think we saw this coming.
1307817576311865345 2020-09-21 07:03:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @gatewaypundit @debbiehager7 @CassandraRules This is so sad.
1307815621262888960 2020-09-21 06:55:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @1Swinging_Voter I would not let this woman near my children.
1307811465160585216 2020-09-21 06:38:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @FlorioGina @drawandstrike She obviously couldn’t answer the question so tried being funny.
1307810099650392064 2020-09-21 06:33:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @think_overnews @BlessUSA45 Yes something useful. These people are contributing nothing to their fellow Americans. Just anarchy.
1307809037824606208 2020-09-21 06:29:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LuanaGoriss So sad these elderly Australians who have contributed so much to this country, have been treated like this in their final days. Most people dont ask for much but some compassion &amp; the comfort from their loved ones in their final days. Shame shame.
1307806977406373891 2020-09-21 06:20:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LuanaGoriss This is what is happening in Victoria. Will we ever recover from the pain of having loved ones die alone. Empathy has been lost.
1307795257917018112 2020-09-21 05:34:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Joe_Hildebrand Agreed but he does not present well as a leader.
1307793384149454848 2020-09-21 05:26:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @robreiner That’s why we can’t vote Biden Harris &amp; Marxism.
1307704892014772225 2020-09-20 23:35:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LABeachGal1 @marshallu She should be sacked.
1307552856132657152 2020-09-20 13:31:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @realDonaldTrump Great speech.
1307552204832690177 2020-09-20 13:28:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @abigailmarone @steph93065 Listened to the whole speech. Amazing the man is in seventies &amp; so much energy. He lives America his could anyone not support him??
1307486814563753984 2020-09-20 09:08:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @carolemorrissey Looking at your bio you don’t even live in Victoria &amp; you are a meat loaf fan. Really???
1307486145803030528 2020-09-20 09:06:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Duke62877627 @Proven_Right @California4T Apparently
1307485764716904448 2020-09-20 09:04:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Proven_Right Their answer to everything if they don’t get their way. Trump was voted in these rabble  are acting like children. Violence should be met with incarceration.
1307455966418366464 2020-09-20 07:06:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LaborIsTrash @kelliekelly23 This never gets old.
1307450881932025856 2020-09-20 06:45:56 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BawdenSnoek What a bunch of rude losers on the view. Does anyone’s still watch???
1307448449642577920 2020-09-20 06:36:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Curious_Normie I can see you are not a happy person but to wish people who do not agree with your politics would all die??
1307443247212494848 2020-09-20 06:15:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AMErikaNGIRLLL These people are evil. Bottom line.
1307306439287795712 2020-09-19 21:11:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CaliConserv1 Both.
1307080351181934599 2020-09-19 06:13:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Ek7_PRN Yes.
1307076272997138432 2020-09-19 05:57:22 +0800 <bluesjack42> @inittowinit007 @iamnotsorry1776 Even if he is convicted after all this time &amp; arrested, he could plead insanity defense, nothing would happen, Harris would maybe get to be president. Then who knows who the vice would be.
1307065310340698115 2020-09-19 05:13:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @imbalaska @ladygaga You might have done but I believe anyone born in USA is lucky.
1306944232448425984 2020-09-18 21:12:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Cliff_Sims @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris This is why I could never support the left. What a nasty world we live in.

1306940068527894529 2020-09-18 20:56:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @LadyRedWave This is insane.
1306795939697274880 2020-09-18 11:23:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews Really this pathetic.
1306794192362905600 2020-09-18 11:16:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @seanhannity @drou_bre No we don’t know what you mean?? Neither do you , it is so sad to see this man being used this way.
1306761870066380800 2020-09-18 09:08:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @paulsperry_ Was his job to come up with a drug used for malaria &amp; being proven to be quite affective but banned by the left. That’s right he did &amp; the left went crazy.
1306760995927289857 2020-09-18 09:04:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ellymelly Never seen that before but apparently the Chinese aren’t into diversity.
1306734945763602432 2020-09-18 07:21:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @pam_sands @newtgingrich But you did censor &amp; you are not cool.
1306733933778755585 2020-09-18 07:17:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CampbellNewman Kevin Rudd should just retire gracefully into the background. He just makes himself look even more ridiculous by the minute.
1306733012109807616 2020-09-18 07:13:22 +0800 <bluesjack42> @hooksbaited Can’t choose.
1306731321377521669 2020-09-18 07:06:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ACTBrigitte It seems like someone with lots of money is paying for these protestors or rioters to be kitted out with weapons &amp; outfits. It should be investigated.
1306724522335195137 2020-09-18 06:39:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @thehill Bit late.
1306712834856820736 2020-09-18 05:53:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MichaelJFell Good.
1306578601022640129 2020-09-17 20:59:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AusAntiLeft Maybe take it out on the person who made the rules on the lockdowns.
1306571439206662146 2020-09-17 20:31:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @whatgives1313 Probs not.
1306423641618358272 2020-09-17 10:44:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HankMeyerNAPP What the hell. Chaos in Victoria.
1306422255623180288 2020-09-17 10:38:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore No
1306376882116415488 2020-09-17 07:38:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealMattCouch The good thing is I am smart enough to know &amp; I Hope most people are smart enough to think for themselves &amp; turn off the ones that are defending the soros’s of the world.
1306375668712615936 2020-09-17 07:33:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealMattCouch Apparently not.
1306356149625614336 2020-09-17 06:15:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JackPosobiec Why do these people think that shouting is a good thing.
1306350996893786112 2020-09-17 05:55:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @buitengebieden_ That panda made a better job of than most people trying to get into a hammock.
1306349503918735360 2020-09-17 05:49:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ACTBrigitte I can’t believe SNL is still on.
1306348023883030529 2020-09-17 05:43:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrAndyNgo Serial offender.
1306347884502159360 2020-09-17 05:43:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrAndyNgo I have tried to tweet something sensible &amp; non nasty about this person. But I can’t so just watch this performance &amp; make up your own minds.
1306346575308890112 2020-09-17 05:37:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump Yes. Although wouldn’t be hard.
1306035402617233408 2020-09-16 09:01:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BawdenSnoek @gatewaypundit Glad there are consequences. The more serious should get prison.
1306034477961891840 2020-09-16 08:57:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @retirewcashflow @YouTube We probably won’t hear about it on msm. That’s a peace prize right there.
1305979875321233410 2020-09-16 05:20:40 +0800 <bluesjack42> @bennyjohnson Apart from that everything she said about America sounded great but everything the dems support is against America.
1305974068194099201 2020-09-16 04:57:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @kiernan_jo @7NewsMelbourne So what.
1305972437394182144 2020-09-16 04:51:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JudgeJeaninefan Why wouldn’t they.
1305847029130604544 2020-09-15 20:32:47 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust @DanielAndrewsMP Resign take his money &amp; run. Leaving behind ruined lives &amp; a ruined state.
1305846644944982016 2020-09-15 20:31:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @nick_thyme Apparently.
1305846212126363648 2020-09-15 20:29:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @netz_melb So he is a liar.
1305832308340002816 2020-09-15 19:34:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @GoalkickingGuru Probably. The arsonists seemed to have been successful in Australia. Many lives ruined.
1305791073508184064 2020-09-15 16:50:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @marklevinshow Hopefully trump will win by a landslides.
1305790855639306245 2020-09-15 16:49:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Thomas1774Paine This was an appalling lack of empathy for fellow Americans. And what did she say. Something happened. It is disgusting.
1305789820002729986 2020-09-15 16:45:28 +0800 <bluesjack42> @barmore27 It’s in their nature . So yes.
1305764137960529920 2020-09-15 15:03:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Jkruge He doesn’t know what he is talking about. These lefties are going to vote for someone with dementia.
1305762687838638081 2020-09-15 14:57:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SenSchumer I really could not care less if people want to zonk out in weed.  It is so not important in my life .
1305727971051757568 2020-09-15 12:39:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ellymelly More like a complete farce.
1305727181448912897 2020-09-15 12:36:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Thomas1774Paine She is a distraction.
1305724158848823302 2020-09-15 12:24:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @dsr150250 Lefties.
1305723690785468417 2020-09-15 12:22:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SisJaneE @joshdcaplan When you deliberately light a fire why aren’t you jailed???
1305722808941473792 2020-09-15 12:19:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HillaryClinton Benghazi will haunt you until your dying breath.  I’m not religious but I hope you find your punishment if there is an afterlife.
1305722074850144261 2020-09-15 12:16:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HorseShort @HillaryClinton It made a hell of a difference to those poor souls who died in Benghazi.
1305721824290897920 2020-09-15 12:15:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HillaryClinton How can you make that comment. We’ve all seen the pictures of those Americans you let die after being tortured for hours. You disgust me.
1305721264279973888 2020-09-15 12:13:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HillaryClinton So not you or Biden then.
1305647112466571264 2020-09-15 07:18:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @OMGTheMess I agree. You should just vote for the candidate you want. Hate this preferential stuff.
1305646545883131904 2020-09-15 07:16:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @pie_sees Not a fan.
1305645358039461889 2020-09-15 07:11:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RealOmarNavarro A man sadly suffering dementia &amp; being used as a pawn in an election. Disgusting abuse really.
1305644102109650949 2020-09-15 07:06:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @brandondarby All I see is violence from protesters &amp; the police driving away.
1305637061613944833 2020-09-15 06:38:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @cindievaccaro @ouchinagirl Do they realize how racist these signs are. All lives matter regardless of race or gender. Bottom line.
1305634960674447361 2020-09-15 06:30:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ClayTravis @Easytime4 Great idea. Joe Rogan is a fair Democrat.
1305618030521511936 2020-09-15 05:22:50 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Thomas1774Paine The old set up story.
1305462017562611712 2020-09-14 19:02:53 +0800 <bluesjack42> @akkitwts Watched so many times. Still love it.
1305449817443692544 2020-09-14 18:14:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BrexitPartridge Don’t mention those 2 people in the same breath. Ridiculous.
1305442396793004033 2020-09-14 17:44:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @surfbird03 Makes perfect sense now.
1305433856237944832 2020-09-14 17:10:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RohanCT @MissHissyKat Well something is going on. I know there are good police but there is problems higher up.
1305430625734676480 2020-09-14 16:58:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden Really just shut up.
1305302118446686208 2020-09-14 08:27:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore By end times, if you mean a western civilization with laws for all people regardless of race, color &amp; protection of our children, I am worried. We have leaders who seem to support anarchy, socialism, communism, Marxism &amp; those that don’t are being attacked.
1305286084113301506 2020-09-14 07:23:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @alphaBrent @Lulu46089824 How can there be lack of evidence when it’s not trialed.????
1305284367904681984 2020-09-14 07:16:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @theonlyrymac @slogess Love that. How could she say she didn’t wipe the emails.?
1305270111700361217 2020-09-14 06:20:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ChuckCallesto Thank goodness.
1305269570781896705 2020-09-14 06:18:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @sophieelsworth They can’t.
1305268887940866049 2020-09-14 06:15:28 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ChuckCallesto Well if that’s the penalty for deliberately shooting someone so be it.
1305267809727832066 2020-09-14 06:11:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden Are you also condemning the anarchists outside the hospital yelling &amp; hoping these officers die.
1305265739545284608 2020-09-14 06:02:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Pro_2A_AZ @markpmeredith True.

1305138884309729280 2020-09-13 21:38:52 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris I’m afraid Biden will not be able to keep that promise. He is not capable.
1305137616283512832 2020-09-13 21:33:50 +0800 <bluesjack42> @netz_melb I guess he needs to be questioned. I hope he tells the truth.
1305030987705847808 2020-09-13 14:30:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @blue01dragonfly What a dork.
1305030334589796352 2020-09-13 14:27:32 +0800 <bluesjack42> @sophieelsworth @theheraldsun That’s a face only a mother could love. What a dork.
1305029101950963714 2020-09-13 14:22:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @piepaulie Well with those ears he probably was a target.
1305028194911662080 2020-09-13 14:19:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Reuters I couldn’t do it for 10 seconds.
1305027442973667328 2020-09-13 14:16:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @nic0legaray Ugly house too.
1304939943534292992 2020-09-13 08:28:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @currie14_kelly @Precliner Truth as usual from tucker.
1304937638814597123 2020-09-13 08:19:12 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Jali_Cat @GavinNewsom @MayorOfLA Same problems in Australia.
1304936508768399360 2020-09-13 08:14:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @markpmeredith That’s a lot of people. Pretty hard to downplay that msm.
1304935247042109440 2020-09-13 08:09:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @smudgesworld2 She could have taken him out but she acted with class something these people know nothing about.
1304931523276148736 2020-09-13 07:54:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Ohun_Ashe Your group broke down gates to private homes &amp; you trespassed.
1304930531692302337 2020-09-13 07:50:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AlyssaRosenberg The trouble is that young girls were acting out this behavior. Also probably great viewing for paedos . Not good parents allowed this.
1304919316458926080 2020-09-13 07:06:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @WreckSeven @kelliekelly23 @BlueSea1964 Sorry I’m Australian &amp; cannot explain this.
1304918506555596802 2020-09-13 07:03:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Kate18660449 That’s called trust.
1304917207239991296 2020-09-13 06:58:01 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Proven_Right Cheating at the elections &amp; destroying evidence come to mind.
1304916480685871104 2020-09-13 06:55:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @R_Impiombato I think is out of his depth totally.
1304916119635984384 2020-09-13 06:53:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ellymelly @VictoriaPolice @DanielAndrewsMP The police have already stated they are ok with lone Victorians but don’t want to escalate violence by arresting violent protestors who break the law. Surely this totally wrong.
1304913823631990784 2020-09-13 06:44:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Tammy17500314 The color of your skin is irrelevant to your character or should be. Judging anyone that way is racist.

1304768661878501379 2020-09-12 21:07:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TomFitton @dawg_lb Why is he laughing??
1304546948179877888 2020-09-12 06:26:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @chrisfawkes How is this person allowed airtime.
1304542214727458817 2020-09-12 06:07:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @417JKO @slogess He will never make it to the election.
1304404830652252160 2020-09-11 21:02:00 +0800 <bluesjack42> @OzraeliAvi They are very alike.
1304404504360570880 2020-09-11 21:00:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @DeAnna4Congress Very good question. I’m sure it would be trumps fault.
1304403731786600449 2020-09-11 20:57:38 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MaryMargOlohan Very popular with a certain group of people. Nauseating.
1304402972542029824 2020-09-11 20:54:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Tim_jbo They will probably bounce back. Already claiming victim status.just wish we didn’t have to listen to either of them again.
1304402441043980289 2020-09-11 20:52:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AmberX994874 Credlin is a wonderful , thoughtful Australian.

1304287672215642112 2020-09-11 13:16:28 +0800 <bluesjack42> @newscomauHQ @AnnastaciaMP Crocodile tears.
1304285742345019392 2020-09-11 13:08:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @annabelcrabb @GladysB I have worked with both men &amp; women. Most women were great but the few that weren’t were the ones that played the victim poor me tricks. I found men a lot easier although obviously there are good &amp; bad. Not confined to race or gender.
1304277769254137856 2020-09-11 12:37:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @atensnut @ATX_PATRIOT It had better be good.
1304275036228911104 2020-09-11 12:26:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AussieVal10 The trouble is Victoria has lost too many human lives &amp; most Victorians have lost their human rights. Total stuff up.
1304253476306903044 2020-09-11 11:00:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @MrAndyNgo @tedwheeler There seems to be quite a few but he is near the top.
1304252170745806850 2020-09-11 10:55:23 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust @DanielAndrewsMP Human rights are always the issue. He has completely lost control.
1304251804163747840 2020-09-11 10:53:56 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews So not the time for this bs.
1304251178549760002 2020-09-11 10:51:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @tedwheeler Is wheeler the one who had to leave his house bc of the violence? If so he is luckier than most who have no choices.
1304249727882530816 2020-09-11 10:45:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ellymelly I know if I had COVID I would be demanding to try the cheap alternatives.
1304221219932090374 2020-09-11 08:52:24 +0800 <bluesjack42> @tracybeanz I cancelled a year ago.
1304214837958905856 2020-09-11 08:27:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SkyNewsAust If you are not making final decisions why are you there &amp; being paid the big bucks.
1304196935964737536 2020-09-11 07:15:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @For_Australia_ @PoliBard @DanielAndrewsMP Still not taking responsibility although he said the buck stops with him.
1304195382163898368 2020-09-11 07:09:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JohnRuddick2 Well seeing that politicians are only there to govern &amp; he seems to have failed the basic test, he should go.
1304194050329731072 2020-09-11 07:04:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Des_Unsociable @AusAntiLeft Some light at the end of the tunnel then.
1304189937906925568 2020-09-11 06:48:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KeiraSavage00 At least this woman told the truth. It’s all about the money.
1304186419405971456 2020-09-11 06:34:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @theheraldsun Surely not a shock.
1304046431536181249 2020-09-10 21:17:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @lisazumba10 I honestly have never watched even the ads fir it.
1304046128468385792 2020-09-10 21:16:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ozhomeschool @Truthsetsufree9 @CaldronPool Don’t care either way bc I no longer watch them.
1304044229929304067 2020-09-10 21:09:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @jenbechwati @AnnastaciaMP @ScottMorrisonMP Really playing the victim card. She was asked to let kids say goodbye to their father. Obviously said no but allowed that Hanks guy &amp; AFL players.
1303987254306562048 2020-09-10 17:22:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RohanCT How can these people live with themselves. Does she really think what she says is ok??
1303985959772409859 2020-09-10 17:17:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RohanCT I am so disgusted at the behavior of some of our politicians. Victorians are living in a police state. For what????
1303984645537554433 2020-09-10 17:12:21 +0800 <bluesjack42> @macsween_prue @AnnastaciaMP @ScottMorrisonMP Unbelievable she is acting like a victim. This poor family that Morrison pleaded that they could be with their father. I am appalled at what had happened to our country. The meaness  &amp; vile acts of power.
1303925794159222784 2020-09-10 13:18:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RobandTracey1 @Studio10au @Joe_Hildebrand You will be missed by me as a liberal. You were one of the good fair ones.
1303925434447310848 2020-09-10 13:17:03 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews I’m not religious but this is disgusting.
1303925142708346881 2020-09-10 13:15:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Fatbob2013 Many innocent people have been killed by terrorists.
1303924737685348354 2020-09-10 13:14:17 +0800 <bluesjack42> @NickAdamsinUSA Biased lefty.

1303923232269979648 2020-09-10 13:08:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RepAdamSchiff I thought we had heard the last of him.
1303923011779612672 2020-09-10 13:07:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SamDavi99667843 You can actually see it in her face. No empathy or compassion just about money.
1303922360437731328 2020-09-10 13:04:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Proven_Right Well I would say no.
1303802715328323584 2020-09-10 05:09:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @VeBo1991 @DGPurser @realDonaldTrump Good.
1303797706205220865 2020-09-10 04:49:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PortlandPolice Complete farce. If someone said this sort of pathetic leadership protecting law Abiding taxpaying citizens would be happening in a country like the USA no one would have believed it.
1303790387002183680 2020-09-10 04:20:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Jennyashash @IASPinfo Also when we no longer have reliable energy.
1303686670999453698 2020-09-09 21:28:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @realDonaldTrump While the violence &amp; hate continues the president is working hard to continue working for Americans. Hopefully they will remember when it’s time to vote.
1303685194424045568 2020-09-09 21:22:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mjcraw4d Not a well looking person.
1303682904912924672 2020-09-09 21:13:20 +0800 <bluesjack42> @tonytardio It’s getting wilder by the minute.
1303682483154644993 2020-09-09 21:11:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PoliBard Have they not heard the rumors??

1303681138905423875 2020-09-09 21:06:19 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HillaryClinton @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump How long did it take to come up with that list of untruths.???
1303465649105059842 2020-09-09 06:50:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @catherine___c Over it.

1303462499451248642 2020-09-09 06:37:31 +0800 <bluesjack42> @64Hyacinth Never thought he was before &amp; definitely not now.
1303461854656643072 2020-09-09 06:34:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @planetpng Those teeth are strong. Good job they are not aggressive &amp; only like bamboo.
1303453303699845129 2020-09-09 06:00:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SavingAmerica4U Unbelievable.
1303308776108224513 2020-09-08 20:26:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @scrubyourhands @no_silenced Our whole family cried even though we were conservatives.
1303308288931454977 2020-09-08 20:24:45 +0800 <bluesjack42> @no_silenced I was in England when the newsreader was blanked out, then reappears wearing a black tie &amp; announced JFK had been shot.
1303307590814760960 2020-09-08 20:21:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Joe_Hildebrand @DanielAndrewsMP Too little too late. Many people have died alone &amp; you can’t change or forgive that.
1303307111116369924 2020-09-08 20:20:04 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Edwinsson Stop worrying about this nonsense we have more to worry about.
1303306668147486720 2020-09-08 20:18:18 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CopseyDan @DanielAndrewsMP Maybe they are just fed up with him too to be fair.
1303131719894138880 2020-09-08 08:43:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @stillgray Do these BLM &amp; antifa people think they will take over USA completely. This is just indiscriminate violence.
1303131222428672001 2020-09-08 08:41:09 +0800 <bluesjack42> @stillgray It seems the only black lives or any lives that matter are people that have committed crimes, resisting arrest &amp; are made into victims by the media.
1303129884001140740 2020-09-08 08:35:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Walshingitout Most older generation in Australia would. I can but choose not to.
1303129070788509696 2020-09-08 08:32:36 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SamDavi99667843 Never were.
1303128700632743936 2020-09-08 08:31:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Proven_Right @realDonaldTrump I honestly don’t know but I think there are a lot of people who can’t own up to voting republican. Mail in voting is a worry though.
1303128337586335744 2020-09-08 08:29:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @netz_melb Maybe that’s the plan.
1302964520466276354 2020-09-07 21:38:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RLamondo I’ve always thought he lacked empathy, very cold &amp; arrogant. These are signs of a psychopath. I’m not saying he is but...
1302963454022615040 2020-09-07 21:34:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Josieamycashman Money.
1302962889641177088 2020-09-07 21:32:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ellymelly Sick of these stupid sayings. We need strong leadership.
1302962486795096064 2020-09-07 21:30:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Canberroo I no longer take any notice of this utter bs pc rubbish. Australia is going through chaos with the lockdowns especially Victoria, &amp; there are people bringing out this stuff.
1302856233460756481 2020-09-07 14:28:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @active8mii @Stevemcbricho We are with you even from south Australia. Had our differences but we need strong opposition to counteract the lefties.
1302855677455396864 2020-09-07 14:26:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Stevemcbricho Don’t give up we need commonsense.
1302854795401728000 2020-09-07 14:22:43 +0800 <bluesjack42> @JoeBiden Well you are neither so it will have to be trump especially if he has a majority.

1302800645716541441 2020-09-07 10:47:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @marklevinshow No
1302800418720739329 2020-09-07 10:46:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @netz_melb Only 23.000 come on Victorians stand up &amp; be counted.
1302790813617848320 2020-09-07 10:08:29 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ezralevant Wow what was that all about. Can imagine the row that ensued.
1302775763821670400 2020-09-07 09:08:41 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mpsmithnews What is wrong with this world. Sick to death if people like this getting away with inciting violence &amp; murder.
1302775383595442176 2020-09-07 09:07:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @laborRtrash What did PVO say??
1302772677292077056 2020-09-07 08:56:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @flk9473 What a disgusting rant from someone who is allowed near children.
1302770965730918400 2020-09-07 08:49:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SKYRIDER4538 Bet that was painful.
1302768845937995776 2020-09-07 08:41:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @pedsscrub @joelockhart This is a man that cares. Not like the lefties with their hatred of law &amp; order.
1302744049879662592 2020-09-07 07:02:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @realTrumpForce Nothing that seems to help Americans. Mostly for his family &amp; himself.
1302737321071005698 2020-09-07 06:35:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AMErikaNGIRLLL No. Nothing worth watching.
1302736978543222784 2020-09-07 06:34:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @brake_llc What Harris said in this statement was a a threat to half of America &amp; should definitely exclude her from any role of power.

1302467495450738688 2020-09-06 12:43:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Proven_Right So are they threatening death. So why aren’t they being arrested???
1302466805454127104 2020-09-06 12:40:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ellymelly It’s not even the continued lockdown, but what happened to bring on the lockdowns in Victoria. Their leader made an almighty fuck up &amp; all Victorians are now paying for it. Their lives ruined &amp; ultimately the rest of Australia will suffer.
1302465363133698059 2020-09-06 12:35:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @swandane Say what you really think mate.

1302433043479629824 2020-09-06 10:26:50 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TurekAndrew @DanielAndrewsMP Agree &amp; a miserable day for someone I can’t name here but who made my daughters &amp; granchildrens life hell.
1302432487688134656 2020-09-06 10:24:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @PoliBard What a ridiculous statement from McManus. The UK has voted for brexit so trade with Australia might be something to help Australian farmers &amp; business in the future.
1302431129887059968 2020-09-06 10:19:14 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SamDavi99667843 Maybe just maybe the people in charge in that state have no idea what they are doing or seem to care.
1302422976055242752 2020-09-06 09:46:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AmberX994874 No wonder he is laughing.
1302422429919182849 2020-09-06 09:44:39 +0800 <bluesjack42> @nick_thyme After 2 lots of 14 days how can there be more cases.
1302403187010236416 2020-09-06 08:28:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @seanhannity @ScottF59 Stop the farce now.
1302401812671021064 2020-09-06 08:22:44 +0800 <bluesjack42> @den2114 @MailOnline I guess they are assuming people who eat in restaurants don’t vote Democrat. I think they will be very disappointed.
1302352912140574720 2020-09-06 05:08:25 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mjgutowski @realDonaldTrump No proof just another smear campaign.
1302351774859182080 2020-09-06 05:03:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @markknoller @realDonaldTrump Meanwhile the democrats are encouraging riots, violence &amp; racism. The president is just getting on with the job of president.
1302350072680648705 2020-09-06 04:57:08 +0800 <bluesjack42> @HerkKerk I don’t know how these democrats get away with these unsubstantiated accusations. This president has shown his support &amp; admiration for the military more than any other president especially Obama.
1302232039840575495 2020-09-05 21:08:07 +0800 <bluesjack42> @waldowns No we don’t.
1302230644978720770 2020-09-05 21:02:34 +0800 <bluesjack42> @TonightHere Just means you have made an obvious choice.
1302229962141757440 2020-09-05 20:59:51 +0800 <bluesjack42> @maggmountains Don’t know but find it hard to trust anything.
1302229194751967238 2020-09-05 20:56:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @VictoriaPolice Maybe if they had stopped earlier protests about something that happened in USA the virus would not have spread so far &amp; the lockdowns unnecessary. Just saying.
1301993754237173760 2020-09-05 05:21:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @redisafford @tedcruz Where is the proof of this?
1301993503187107840 2020-09-05 05:20:15 +0800 <bluesjack42> @tedcruz Yes remember the good old days  when there was law &amp; order &amp; law abiding people felt safe to go about their lives.  No longer.
1301641484874051584 2020-09-04 06:01:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BradfieldThe @KKeneally It’s getting tricky now with who the left decide to support.
1301640094563012609 2020-09-04 05:55:56 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Hoosiers1986 Yes.
1301636905033846788 2020-09-04 05:43:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @1776Stonewall Sounds lovely. Maybe they will get on ok.
1301498285702619136 2020-09-03 20:32:26 +0800 <bluesjack42> @ErrolWebber @derbybbb @TheDemocrats This is the Democrat party that some people might actually vote for.
1301497464302624774 2020-09-03 20:29:10 +0800 <bluesjack42> @bennyjohnson @barryv223 How can people be allowed to live like this??
1301494156385116162 2020-09-03 20:16:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @9NewsMelb @andrew_lund If there are new cases after this long lockdown some people must still be doing the wrong thing.
1301493036233428992 2020-09-03 20:11:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @9NewsSyd I love the AFL but I think this is quite sickening.
1301492086617731072 2020-09-03 20:07:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Lesqueenb As long as they weren’t blocking my car I would leave them there I guess.
1301397991970856960 2020-09-03 13:53:54 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump Hopefully.
1301324793287909376 2020-09-03 09:03:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore @SpeakerPelosi Definitely.
1301324707929550848 2020-09-03 09:02:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @latimes Vomit.
1301324578237546496 2020-09-03 09:02:11 +0800 <bluesjack42> @AmberX994874 @netflix Cancelled mine a while ago. Just lefty rubbish.
1301320514460286976 2020-09-03 08:46:02 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Voiceoflogic949 @KamVTV Don’t be mean about golden retrievers.
1301295289769234432 2020-09-03 07:05:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @greggutfeld @jihadwatchRS Love Greg Gutfield. So the people who have been affected by the fires, violence &amp; looting are lying? What a crap thing to say.
1301286019937890305 2020-09-03 06:28:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @mattjcan I love AFL but not sure this is what we should focus on during the pandemic. But I am a crows supporter.
1301285474770718720 2020-09-03 06:26:48 +0800 <bluesjack42> @catturd2 So a complete waste of time.
1301285340527820800 2020-09-03 06:26:16 +0800 <bluesjack42> @robertwlk Best tweet today. Shows how starved we are are of clever comedy.
1301282780479811585 2020-09-03 06:16:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Fatbob2013 I agree. This will affect Australia as well.
1301280236332433408 2020-09-03 06:05:59 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BrandonStraka Never bc I believe they are a terrorist group &amp; I believe like most people that all lives matter.raising my fist or not is my choice &amp; obviously by the violent behavior of these anarchists does not mean they believe any lives matter.
1301278715477811200 2020-09-03 05:59:57 +0800 <bluesjack42> @GrumpyOLSoldier Not to mention people suiciding, lost incomes.
1301276017684750336 2020-09-03 05:49:13 +0800 <bluesjack42> @KeiraSavage00 I feel despair for Australia. We cannot accept that arresting pregnant or non pregnant Australians for FB posts as what we expect as normality, but violence is ignored.
1301266379639726081 2020-09-03 05:10:55 +0800 <bluesjack42> @sheila06942158 @nypost I hope she stays safe.
1301262769568665601 2020-09-03 04:56:35 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RitaPanahi A sense of pride.
1301255782965547008 2020-09-03 04:28:49 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CindyKendrick11 The only person skilled &amp; sane enough to do it.
1301251758698631173 2020-09-03 04:12:50 +0800 <bluesjack42> @hollandcourtney @YohJudy She is a piece of work that one.
1301138982311395328 2020-09-02 20:44:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @Al6108185355 @DanielAndrewsMP So I wonder what you should have called him.
1301081606552055808 2020-09-02 16:56:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @OzraeliAvi @VictoriaPolice This is unbelievable. That poor woman. I can’t believe this is Australia.
1301078653502013441 2020-09-02 16:44:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @RodS108443078 Anything for money. Typical.
1301078433326227457 2020-09-02 16:44:06 +0800 <bluesjack42> @EvanAKilgore @TuckerCarlson Love him.
1301077395680583680 2020-09-02 16:39:58 +0800 <bluesjack42> @SamDavi99667843 So true. No idea.
1300923562958618624 2020-09-02 06:28:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @GROGParty Peaceful protests Biden. Excuse this behavior, you can’t.
1300923314555158528 2020-09-02 06:27:42 +0800 <bluesjack42> @GROGParty Wow what is going on in America?
1300896614945452032 2020-09-02 04:41:37 +0800 <bluesjack42> @laddiecomehome1 @WashTimes @mschlapp What hair?
1300896072869445632 2020-09-02 04:39:27 +0800 <bluesjack42> @CRRJA5 @BeanK511 @SymoneDSanders @JoeBiden If it is so peaceful why wouldn’t you visit?
1300893832813314048 2020-09-02 04:30:33 +0800 <bluesjack42> @BaxterPeterba @JulianBurnside Bs.
