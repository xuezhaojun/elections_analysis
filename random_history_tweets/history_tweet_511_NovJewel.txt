1339245589502935042 2020-12-17 00:26:45 +0800 <NovJewel> @RexChapman Good for Tom Cruise! He wants to make sure everyone is safe and it only takes one person to endanger the lives of many. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
1338477971615567877 2020-12-14 21:36:30 +0800 <NovJewel> @iammrssamuels It amazes me how @Andy just glossed over your receipts and didn’t follow up with any questions of his own about Jamal. Good thing @KARENHUGER was there. She was the only one who had your back.

1331108171696410625 2020-11-24 13:31:33 +0800 <NovJewel> Get well soon and thank you for your service.
1331041110727135233 2020-11-24 09:05:05 +0800 <NovJewel> @PalmerReport Exactly!!! That’s why I turned it off.
1331023885353906176 2020-11-24 07:56:38 +0800 <NovJewel> @ResisterForever @realDonaldTrump Back at you. I have been following you for awhile and I am so happy we are in this together.
1330968991251087360 2020-11-24 04:18:30 +0800 <NovJewel> @Amy_Siskind Yes @Amy_Siskind ! I am so annoyed with all of this foolishness. I listened in for awhile and for my own self care I clicked it off after the one guy was saying why can’t we hold out for the allotted 39 days or something. Enough already...
1330921074565865478 2020-11-24 01:08:06 +0800 <NovJewel> @beaversnducks I am so sorry for your loss! 😢
1330920339937714176 2020-11-24 01:05:11 +0800 <NovJewel> @NotDevinsMom I LOVE YOU! That’s all. I just needed to say that.
1330903937927430145 2020-11-24 00:00:00 +0800 <NovJewel> @kylegriffin1 @kylegriffin1 Why in the world are taxpayers footing the bill for this foolishness?

1330444848030158848 2020-11-22 17:35:44 +0800 <NovJewel> @ZekeJMiller No @ZekeJMiller you know what is “unacceptable” is the fact that the current occupant of the WH can do whatever he wants and you all don’t say anything for FOUR YEARS and President Biden goes to church and y’all have a hissy fit. So it’s starting already, huh?

1329909912021843969 2020-11-21 06:10:06 +0800 <NovJewel> @B52Malmet They want to piss people off. Don’t fall for it! Another attempt to get folks to take to the streets so he can call in the guard IMO.
1329909111245348864 2020-11-21 06:06:55 +0800 <NovJewel> @ABC7 Don’t fall for the bait! They want people to take to the streets. Another ploy to call out the guards. Who didn’t see this coming?

1329561314432147456 2020-11-20 07:04:54 +0800 <NovJewel> @marceelias ???
1329512671327051776 2020-11-20 03:51:36 +0800 <NovJewel> @amandacarpenter @amandacarpenter I agree with you 100%. Everyone keeps saying “this is unprecedented” and “that is unprecedented” well figure out how to respond so this doesn’t happen again. He will not go away peacefully and Dems keeping quiet is not helping. Each act is more brazen before.
1329469089798995969 2020-11-20 00:58:26 +0800 <NovJewel> @Susan_Hennessey AS IF any of the other thousands of stories and videos deterred his worshippers and followers from loving him or voting for him. Oh that’s what would have made all the difference 🙄🙄🙄.
1329463493976674305 2020-11-20 00:36:11 +0800 <NovJewel> @jonswaine @JennaEllisEsq @rickhasen How about the good guys stop telling them what they are doing wrong so they can fix errors in a timely manner? Just a thought...
1329454270282944512 2020-11-19 23:59:32 +0800 <NovJewel> @lisastark351 Bigger question is why aren’t the Dems doing anything about it? I know why it happened because he, Graham, etc., are never held accountable.
1329453629238112256 2020-11-19 23:56:59 +0800 <NovJewel> @samstein Unbelievable! And @SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer want us to continually vote for Dems (which I did) but at what point will they actually fight for all Americans. There is no way Republicans wouldn’t have either forced a resignation (@AlFranken4Pres) or worse yet Dems do zip!
1329451549991559170 2020-11-19 23:48:44 +0800 <NovJewel> @Burrite @MrJonCryer It is maddening that they are doing absolutely nothing. Impeach him again! Can the Dems agree on that or anything? Make him deal with that for the next 30 days. Perhaps the ridiculous lawsuits will stop but do something.
1329445878386593793 2020-11-19 23:26:11 +0800 <NovJewel> @waltshaub @Acosta Exactly! Stop going willingly into the insanity. If no one “shows up” maybe this will end sooner rather than in a month and a half?
1329441180451557379 2020-11-19 23:07:31 +0800 <NovJewel> @marceelias @marceelias This is great news! Thank you for being on the right side of history and fighting so hard for democracy. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

1327056365462831104 2020-11-13 09:11:07 +0800 <NovJewel> @sheilaomarcus @MuellerSheWrote Great question!
1327052198820208640 2020-11-13 08:54:34 +0800 <NovJewel> THANK YOU!!! We need those seats and she knows it. It is starting to make me wonder...
1327030247582179328 2020-11-13 07:27:20 +0800 <NovJewel> @kylegriffin1 Okay but Kentucky...? 👀
1327020907332734976 2020-11-13 06:50:13 +0800 <NovJewel> Since trump has to have damaging information on lots of the GOP (at least that’s how I explain them going along with everything he does), does that mean the information now goes to President Biden because he likely used taxpayers money to acquire it? @LouiseMensch
1326963424509587458 2020-11-13 03:01:48 +0800 <NovJewel> @travisakers So what happened? Did they have a meeting and they all decided that they would get on board all at one time?
1326641346208124928 2020-11-12 05:41:59 +0800 <NovJewel> @MollyMcKew I wonder if this was a last minute addition to his schedule because he knew President Biden would be sincerely honoring our Veterans?
1326348999742218240 2020-11-11 10:20:18 +0800 <NovJewel> @MollyMcKew Will the funds be released prior to January 20, 2021? If so, it may be another chance at grabbing more money prior to leaving?
1326348205513060352 2020-11-11 10:17:09 +0800 <NovJewel> @damianpaletta @JStein_WaPo @ericawerner @jdawsey1 Hmmm. Will funds be released before January 20, 2021? Is this another chance at a money grab before they leave???
1326296096591638529 2020-11-11 06:50:05 +0800 <NovJewel> @WasOnceLou @NoahShachtman This is all because President Biden is already at work and it shines a spotlight on the fact that he did zero for four years.
1326286832871514112 2020-11-11 06:13:16 +0800 <NovJewel> ✋🏽

1325914899025809409 2020-11-10 05:35:20 +0800 <NovJewel> @HKrassenstein Once again I say that 70 days is too long between the election and the transition time. Will the American people have to be tortured for another month and a half?
1325913110465507328 2020-11-10 05:28:14 +0800 <NovJewel> @Grammie2seven @fred_guttenberg @AAA_Travel And Joe is telling us to try to get along with these lunatics. They are not reasonable people. He would leave that young man stranded because of a sticker? 😳
1325912096396115968 2020-11-10 05:24:12 +0800 <NovJewel> @Grammie2seven @fred_guttenberg @AAA_Travel Same here. Mom hs had their service for 49 yrs and I (aside from her) have had their service for 30+. Not to mention the rest of the family and friends. #Unacceptable
1325865589814906880 2020-11-10 02:19:24 +0800 <NovJewel> @lisastark351 Can we keep it together long enough to get the two Senate seats in Georgia PLEASE?
1325850048580653056 2020-11-10 01:17:39 +0800 <NovJewel> @BettyBuckley I blocked him three years ago.
1325841277770891265 2020-11-10 00:42:48 +0800 <NovJewel> @Sifill_LDF Yes they should including how he got “re-elected” 🙄.
1325831309785141256 2020-11-10 00:03:11 +0800 <NovJewel> @thedailybeast So that tells Biden and team exactly where he still stands and they should treat him accordingly.
1325626651208638464 2020-11-09 10:29:57 +0800 <NovJewel> @RawStory At his instruction I’m sure.
1325519674432352256 2020-11-09 03:24:52 +0800 <NovJewel> @RawStory Great story. Glad to hear they will NOT depend solely on “relationships” with the GOP who only cooperates when there is something in it for them.
1325388066345775107 2020-11-08 18:41:54 +0800 <NovJewel> @mmpadellan Me too!!!!!!!
1325250977155280896 2020-11-08 09:37:09 +0800 <NovJewel> @NotDevinsMom Exactly!!! Going in they know that once again the GOP is not willing to work together.

1325189636998656010 2020-11-08 05:33:24 +0800 <NovJewel> @sandibachom My exact thought!!! Wait until after he is no longer “president”.
1325189191324504064 2020-11-08 05:31:38 +0800 <NovJewel> @AshaRangappa_ @Independent So this is them admitting that he has dones crimes for which he requires a pardon? Hmmm...

1324877129662623744 2020-11-07 08:51:37 +0800 <NovJewel> @TimInHonolulu That sounds like the opposite of what Pete Williams just said on @MSNBC. They will count now?

1324744225305452544 2020-11-07 00:03:30 +0800 <NovJewel> @Lawrence @Lawrence There is a recount going on in Georgia. Do you think it will matter?

1324674261294804992 2020-11-06 19:25:29 +0800 <NovJewel> You are correct! If there is one incident the story they will tell is that all of the shenanigans of the past few days were Dems. #Lies

1324374294047027201 2020-11-05 23:33:32 +0800 <NovJewel> @marceelias @RiskyLiberal Fight until every vote is counted for every one of those people who stood in lines for hours and waited for machines that were sabotaged not to work but they remained steadfast and they waited. For those whose ballots were “lost”.
1324346531651096576 2020-11-05 21:43:12 +0800 <NovJewel> @waltshaub No and still 2020 😂.

1324037538118422533 2020-11-05 01:15:23 +0800 <NovJewel> YESSS!!!! As a Black woman in America the fact that this is even close is disheartening but the fact that votes were recovered and swiftly counted gives me hope.

I cannot believe that there is no way to stop all of this lawlessness. What are the Dems prepared to do WHEN he challenges the election results because he will and the GOP will back him?

1319756856043040769 2020-10-24 05:45:29 +0800 <NovJewel> @NotDevinsMom I called bologna on that on Day 1. Never bought it. I pray every day that they all be exposed for that horrible lie. Many families have suffered for real and that is not okay.
1319460459888611328 2020-10-23 10:07:42 +0800 <NovJewel> @B52Malmet I am so annoyed... again. She starts off assertively saying we have to move on and when he keeps talking anyway she says “ok 10 seconds” which means absolutely nothing to him 🙄.

I kept saying “hug him before you leave”. That would have meant the world to him but she stood there with her arms crossed 🙄 after he told her what he needs.
1319299284601241600 2020-10-22 23:27:15 +0800 <NovJewel> @cheytowngirl @MAFSLifetime I felt so badly for Bennett. He planned a romantic dinner and she drops the bombshell that she just wanted to be on tv. Sorry not sorry but I feel way different about her now.
1319298330472509449 2020-10-22 23:23:28 +0800 <NovJewel> @theSheenaB @MAFSLifetime I know that the guys and most of the ladies expressed that they didn’t like Brett after the bachelor party but unless there is footage that they haven’t showed us I feel like she never gave him a chance. She didn’t even want to sit near him on the couch when Pastor Cal cam by.

1316924618238812160 2020-10-16 10:11:10 +0800 <NovJewel> @JohnMTalmadgeMD It was a pleasure to watch clear, concise, uninterrupted responses to real problems/issues. @JoeBiden is a breath of fresh air.
1316911553929711620 2020-10-16 09:19:16 +0800 <NovJewel> @RobAnderson2018 I can’t wait to virtually celebrate with you! 💥🎉

1316897292440334336 2020-10-16 08:22:35 +0800 <NovJewel> Loving @JoeBiden at this Town Hall. It’s really nice to be able to hear him respond to questions without interruption.
1316893833389436929 2020-10-16 08:08:51 +0800 <NovJewel> @mmpadellan Stephanopoulos is pissing me off FULL STOP!
1316893515863871488 2020-10-16 08:07:35 +0800 <NovJewel> Streaming @JoeBiden on my computer, two tvs and cell phone. #ratings

1316883883581825025 2020-10-16 07:29:19 +0800 <NovJewel> @mmpadellan I panicked also. Earlier today I sent a slightly snippy tweet to Newsom about those fake ballot boxes that the GOP claimed but refuses to remove. I thought I was in trouble.
1316880323230142466 2020-10-16 07:15:10 +0800 <NovJewel> @kimwehle @PalmerReport @jaketapper Me too and I received confirmation that my ballot was received. 👍🏽
1316879750665699332 2020-10-16 07:12:53 +0800 <NovJewel> @feliciasonmez He is not even grateful that NBC rewarded his bad behavior. He insults them. Good for them.
1316879147809955840 2020-10-16 07:10:29 +0800 <NovJewel> @Susan_Hennessey @Zac_Petkanas 100% correct. Remember why you’re there. Be “friends” after work. Just sayin’...
1316879025554350080 2020-10-16 07:10:00 +0800 <NovJewel> @HowardA_Esq Agreed!
1316878984383098881 2020-10-16 07:09:50 +0800 <NovJewel> @goldengateblond I totally agree!
1316877929767264256 2020-10-16 07:05:39 +0800 <NovJewel> @fred_guttenberg @ABC @JoeBiden Already done.
1316824320014909440 2020-10-16 03:32:37 +0800 <NovJewel> @B52Malmet Why can’t @GavinNewsom send someone to round them up like DeJoy did will the mailboxes? He hasn’t replaced them and there have been no repercussions for that. Do no rules/laws apply to the GOP? Asking for all Californians...
1316823316414394368 2020-10-16 03:28:38 +0800 <NovJewel> @B52Malmet They will roll the dice that the Dems won’t do anything about it and in doing so they will rob thousands of having their votes counted and their voices heard.
1316518290986950657 2020-10-15 07:16:34 +0800 <NovJewel> @AmandaMarcotte Seriously?!!! 😳 Says the Black woman who would definitely feel like I was in a hostile environment if someone called me that.
1316517546988716032 2020-10-15 07:13:37 +0800 <NovJewel> @maiamimi Great advice. I have been telling my family and friends the same thing. Sorry to say but there could be some rogue poll workers.
1316516600934068224 2020-10-15 07:09:52 +0800 <NovJewel> @abigailm1971 I will be watching Biden.

1316440885052280832 2020-10-15 02:08:59 +0800 <NovJewel> @greenfield64 100%. I am done with NBC not that they care but...
1316440435460431872 2020-10-15 02:07:12 +0800 <NovJewel> @B52Malmet Once again there are no consequences for his irrational behavior.
1316440097924022272 2020-10-15 02:05:52 +0800 <NovJewel> @mmpadellan I said the exact same thing. Where’s the empathy for them if not for other people of color?
1316439563150258179 2020-10-15 02:03:44 +0800 <NovJewel> @GeorgeTakei No way!
1316173522809450496 2020-10-14 08:26:35 +0800 <NovJewel> @MeghanForBiden Thank you!
1316172299356106752 2020-10-14 08:21:44 +0800 <NovJewel> @JoyceWhiteVance @KamalaHarris I agree. Looks like someone hyped her up during the break. She was not like that earlier.
1316148806392504320 2020-10-14 06:48:22 +0800 <NovJewel> @JRehling Thieves and liars. “Accident”???
1316148474711216129 2020-10-14 06:47:03 +0800 <NovJewel> @funder @grantstern That is what this boils down to. She wouldn’t hire a person representing themselves this way.
1316118452453609474 2020-10-14 04:47:46 +0800 <NovJewel> @nayyeroar I did. First thing this morning.
1316115090379206656 2020-10-14 04:34:24 +0800 <NovJewel> @davidhogg111 Especially since we are facing fake ballot boxes placed all over in several cities in California by the GOP.

1314363079140941832 2020-10-09 08:32:32 +0800 <NovJewel> @rmayemsinger This description is spot on!
1314031345560027142 2020-10-08 10:34:20 +0800 <NovJewel> @MSNBC How many questions didn’t Pence answer? Actually, it might be easier to count how many questions he answered. Didn’t see that tweet. Did I miss it?
1314030018834526208 2020-10-08 10:29:04 +0800 <NovJewel> @briiiiaaannnaa Congratulations!
1314027684368846848 2020-10-08 10:19:48 +0800 <NovJewel> @JuddLegum And yet has the gall to say Harris didn’t answer a question.
1314025360858595328 2020-10-08 10:10:34 +0800 <NovJewel> @PalmerReport Harris needs to bounce back with asking Pence to answer just one question he has been asked. He sits there and “thanks” Susan for the questions but he never answers them.
1314024219013861377 2020-10-08 10:06:01 +0800 <NovJewel> @PalmerReport I am screaming at her through the tv. I am over these so called moderators.
1314023535635906561 2020-10-08 10:03:18 +0800 <NovJewel> @SenKamalaHarris has been extremely polite and amenable and for what? This moderator still allows Pence to interrupt her and take more time than allowed.
1314020660285333504 2020-10-08 09:51:53 +0800 <NovJewel> @JoyceWhiteVance And once again we have a moderator who allows it but then cut Senator Harris off.
1314020329358991360 2020-10-08 09:50:34 +0800 <NovJewel> @B52Malmet 45 minutes in and I have to mute the tv when he talks.  Fake fake and fake.
1314019823953666048 2020-10-08 09:48:33 +0800 <NovJewel> @DanRather Yes he did.

1313871839664300032 2020-10-08 00:00:31 +0800 <NovJewel> @Weinsteinlaw @TimInHonolulu I feel like once again the Dems caved. There should be a fortress around her if they are in the same room. It really should have been done remotely. Pence goes along with everything he is ordered to do. When was the last time he was tested and who will verify that information?
1313509113456848896 2020-10-06 23:59:11 +0800 <NovJewel> @santiagomayer_ Agreed but there is still 28 days for them to pull something. #Vote
1313508435078438912 2020-10-06 23:56:29 +0800 <NovJewel> @joncoopertweets He pulled his ads in Ohio. Come on. He has a plan to steal this election.
1313508054109831173 2020-10-06 23:54:58 +0800 <NovJewel> @mmpadellan I pray that their votes will be counted. 🙏🏽
1313444461142179840 2020-10-06 19:42:16 +0800 <NovJewel> @FlossObama I believe her Mom is aware of how she posts everything that goes on in their home and she is making certain that Claudia hears EXACTLY what she wants her to hear so she can “report” it. I’m still not buying it! #charade/setup
1313255457931239424 2020-10-06 07:11:14 +0800 <NovJewel> @Zac_Petkanas Sham!
1313255084424192001 2020-10-06 07:09:45 +0800 <NovJewel> @mmpadellan I have said that from the moment they made the announcement. Again, a “cure/vaccine” is on the way and no doubt he has some interest in it.
1313253813965398016 2020-10-06 07:04:42 +0800 <NovJewel> Exactly! As soon as he gets off of Marine One he takes his mask off. What about everyone else in the house?
1313220316022280192 2020-10-06 04:51:36 +0800 <NovJewel> @FaltusEugene 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
1313212295015591941 2020-10-06 04:19:44 +0800 <NovJewel> @B52Malmet And that is why he is “back”. The charade didn’t work so he has to get back to his base. I said from the second I heard this that it is a ploy to keep from “debating” Biden again.

1313194329750466560 2020-10-06 03:08:20 +0800 <NovJewel> @chrislhayes @aliasvaughn Why can’t it be virtual? Businesses are doing it everyday. They are not going to shake hands so why should they take the unnecessary risk when they don’t have to?
1313144772911980550 2020-10-05 23:51:25 +0800 <NovJewel> Still skeptical about all of this for some reason. Will an executive order be signed saying that they all have FREE healthcare for life now? Just asking...
1312882511563821058 2020-10-05 06:29:17 +0800 <NovJewel> @B52Malmet @Amy_Siskind That is 100% my opinion.

1312879373670707200 2020-10-05 06:16:49 +0800 <NovJewel> @ProjectLincoln Those ads should be back up within the hour.
1312877830376628224 2020-10-05 06:10:41 +0800 <NovJewel> @mmpadellan @Yamiche I knew it was a lie. He has left the hospital.

1312511135296286722 2020-10-04 05:53:34 +0800 <NovJewel> @HillBeverlyhill Which is a huge reason I am not buying this story. Just sayin’.
1312510153657249792 2020-10-04 05:49:40 +0800 <NovJewel> @mat_johnson Exactly! The Dems are getting played. Full speed ahead @JoeBiden.  He would have demanded that you get out of the race by now. The country needs you now. By the time the truth comes out it may be too late.
1312502248501473280 2020-10-04 05:18:15 +0800 <NovJewel> @MeidasTouch Nope. Not buying what they’re selling. There’s gonna be a “cure” very soon. Mark my words.

1312170508989812736 2020-10-03 07:20:02 +0800 <NovJewel> @thehill YES!!! Hillary was mocked when she had pneumonia. He did NOT suspend his campaign.
1311363766550843392 2020-10-01 01:54:20 +0800 <NovJewel> @SweetFnLucifer @World_Of_Hurt “Mic dropped”. At this point that is all it could be.
1311325171945361409 2020-09-30 23:20:58 +0800 <NovJewel> @SteveSchmidtSES You are absolutely correct. I have turned my comments off for awhile because I cannot “fight” with one more trumper coming on my page telling me what a great job he did. 😳 Seriously?
1311321726169489408 2020-09-30 23:07:17 +0800 <NovJewel> @patrrcom1 @clairecmc @pattonoswalt Bless your heart 😂.
1311320958817320961 2020-09-30 23:04:14 +0800 <NovJewel> @OneTweetDefeat I have enough of a brain not to waste my time on an inbred, delusional, Brad Pitt wannabe, non-existent gray matter, herd mentality  loser like yourself. If I wanted your inane opinion I would have asked for it which I didn’t.
1311143959301775361 2020-09-30 11:20:54 +0800 <NovJewel> @pickleslindsey @clairecmc @pattonoswalt I am exhausted from that farce. I am not going to lose more brain cells dealing with your inane comment.
1311132819423330305 2020-09-30 10:36:38 +0800 <NovJewel> @JoyceWhiteVance Nope!
1311131546124840962 2020-09-30 10:31:34 +0800 <NovJewel> @lisastark351 EVER!
1311128577807511553 2020-09-30 10:19:47 +0800 <NovJewel> I know Joe doesn’t want to stoop to t-rump’s level but when he constantly brings up his son getting money from China he is opening the door for Joe to talk about all of the money he and his children are grifting from the American people.
1311127990219096064 2020-09-30 10:17:27 +0800 <NovJewel> @GeorgeTakei What in the actual HECK is Wallace there for???
1311126935775313920 2020-09-30 10:13:15 +0800 <NovJewel> @JuddLegum 100%
1311123823350095880 2020-09-30 10:00:53 +0800 <NovJewel> I wanted Joe to mention Herman Cain but hopefully people are aware.
1311121217227689984 2020-09-30 09:50:32 +0800 <NovJewel> @realityleesh @clairecmc @pattonoswalt SHUT UP!!!! Idiot!!!
1311120290986909704 2020-09-30 09:46:51 +0800 <NovJewel> @Teesa_Michele Yes! I have been screaming at the tv for almost an hour. Wallace allows t-rump to talk over Biden Bd take up Biden’s time and then cuts Biden off.
1311119202325917696 2020-09-30 09:42:31 +0800 <NovJewel> @clairecmc @pattonoswalt I am SO over Chris Wallace! He allows him to keep going but he shuts down Biden.
1311113222745800705 2020-09-30 09:18:46 +0800 <NovJewel> @TeaPainUSA Why is Chris Wallace NOT doing his job???
1311102542789529605 2020-09-30 08:36:19 +0800 <NovJewel> @B52Malmet I totally agree with those people and I planned to DVR it so that I could refer to it when I heard the recap from someone else. Now I have it on two TVs, DVRing it, live streaming a round table on YouTube and tuning in to @pattonoswalt on Twitter.
1311100194642038786 2020-09-30 08:27:00 +0800 <NovJewel> @JenniferJJacobs Is this so his base will not tune in and they can give them their version of what was said?

1308239914677411841 2020-09-22 11:01:16 +0800 <NovJewel> @robreiner I am so over allowing them to get away with everything! Tons of lawyers, scholars, etc., and all of them are just talking/threatening to do something. The time has passed for idle words. We are literally dying here.
