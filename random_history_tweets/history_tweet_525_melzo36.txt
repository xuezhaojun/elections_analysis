1344067708527157249 2020-12-30 07:48:07 +0800 <melzo36> @TravisAllen02 I understand his wife comes from wealth but still a gov't paycheck and this is one's worth ??  If McConnell was to be under investigation .... what would be found ? where did the money come from?
1344067293324615680 2020-12-30 07:46:28 +0800 <melzo36> @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Ummm you didn't win the election .. You won nothing !!
1344027038584250368 2020-12-30 05:06:31 +0800 <melzo36> @jeremywball I believe McConnell said he would block everything put out by the Dems, he doesn't care how good it is ... it's a disgrace ...
1344026418582188032 2020-12-30 05:04:03 +0800 <melzo36> @keithedwards @PuestoLoco @Perduesenate all for a vote, not to do the right thing by people.  Thanks to @senatemajldr Dems just might have won the Senate ... But McConnell did say he will block everything put out by the Dems, he doesn't care how good it is ...
1344020261587144704 2020-12-30 04:39:35 +0800 <melzo36> @JasonMillerinDC Oh just for a vote not for the American people .... Tell if like it is POS
1344020023233241088 2020-12-30 04:38:38 +0800 <melzo36> @tedcruz scum of the earth ted ..
1344009121817759744 2020-12-30 03:55:19 +0800 <melzo36> @funder Well, dems may have very well won the senate
1344008416616796161 2020-12-30 03:52:31 +0800 <melzo36> @thomaskaine5 and McConnell to that !
1343991988404641792 2020-12-30 02:47:14 +0800 <melzo36> @SenSchumer @SenSanders Seems @senatemajldr would rather see people on the streets or in a grave.  Food banks are empty, unemployment severely behind.  Why is it other countries are caring for citizens better than America ?  Thought this was the greatest country on earth ... hint: was at one time
1343991205743325185 2020-12-30 02:44:08 +0800 <melzo36> @NBCNews @senatemajldr like Trump  .... A piece of sh*t .. How in the hell did this a**hole get re-elected ??
1343990733074644992 2020-12-30 02:42:15 +0800 <melzo36> @tedlieu @InSpiteOfTrump @senatemajldr @SpeakerPelosi  take out the millions in aid to other countries and give Americans what they need to survive ,way to much fluff in this bill .. Thought America First ? BTW what are the Trumps and huge corporations profiting this time ??
1343989173506600960 2020-12-30 02:36:03 +0800 <melzo36> @senatemajldr Truly Fu*k Off you sh*tted on citizens once again ...
1343988955537031168 2020-12-30 02:35:11 +0800 <melzo36> @David_Leavitt I have worse to say, but that will do for now ....
1343988746320977920 2020-12-30 02:34:21 +0800 <melzo36> @SenSanders @SenMarkey @senatemajldr Truly sad that other countries are caring for citizens better than America... $600 does absolutely nothing. McConnell rather see people on the streets or in a grave.  We need help now-not tomorrow, next week, next year. Food banks are empty, unemployment behind ...
1343980345511747585 2020-12-30 02:00:58 +0800 <melzo36> @senatemajldr @GOP would rather see people in graves than help them to put food on the table .. It's the middle class that keeps the economy going ....  How in the hell did McConnell get reelected ?   https://t.co/YLgFVeOgoh
1343979482244210689 2020-12-30 01:57:33 +0800 <melzo36> @laurenboebert You best do some research on former first ladies and look at the elegance, grace and class and what they did for American citizens. Melania is a fraud far from elegant or grace ... What former first lady posed for nude photos in mens magazines &amp; married wealth to come to USA?
1343972729481916416 2020-12-30 01:30:43 +0800 <melzo36> @kylegriffin1 not surprised @senatemajldr could care less that American's are suffering ... he has his wealth  ...Like Trump a maggot to society
1343969482310471681 2020-12-30 01:17:48 +0800 <melzo36> @JuddLegum They are only voting for it to increase chances of winning .... NOT for doing the right thing by people

1343694626494943232 2020-12-29 07:05:38 +0800 <melzo36> @FoxReports @brianstelter well, considering @senatemajldr would rather see people in graves rather than provide assistance I would not hold my breath on this .... McConnell does not want to hand out any further aid to Americans
1343690344240594944 2020-12-29 06:48:37 +0800 <melzo36> @JasonMillerinDC oh boy ... let’s spread the virus even more and fill the heads of the uneducated with propaganda bs ! now that’s something to be proud of
1343689105293496320 2020-12-29 06:43:41 +0800 <melzo36> @FoxNews @PressSec not baseless, a fraud a liar .. we don’t like liars !! @jaketapper was spot on, look in the mirror Kayleigh ... are you proud of the reflection ?
1343686449032359936 2020-12-29 06:33:08 +0800 <melzo36> @GeorgePapa19 what are you ?
1343681215275003906 2020-12-29 06:12:20 +0800 <melzo36> @NikkiHaley close the public schools, fire dept , police dept, social service programs , stimulus payments and so on ... a form of socialism is around everyone daily
1343667771171766273 2020-12-29 05:18:55 +0800 <melzo36> @realDonaldTrump more lies ... just stop
1343644413541588992 2020-12-29 03:46:06 +0800 <melzo36> @christoq The more I hear about this man sounds like he had  schizophrenia, wonder if medical history has been looked in to yet ... this could have ended far far worse but do consider this domestic terrorism
1343629307013316609 2020-12-29 02:46:04 +0800 <melzo36> @HouseGOP Not really stating the facts !  Just more lies, upon lies, upon lies ... Republican party has truly lost its way

1343628065784569856 2020-12-29 02:41:08 +0800 <melzo36> @Jim_Jordan @JudiciaryGOP actually imbecile sick kids, sick staff closed the school ! Teachers who's safety is in jeopardy due to lack of PPE ... Many people have health conditions where contracting Covid is a death sentence.  How is it that ur pathetic ass is in public service !!  Just a disgrace
1343618702822891521 2020-12-29 02:03:56 +0800 <melzo36> @IvankaTrump @USAmbIsrael @IsraeliPM I can only ask since the Trumps are liars and cheats what did the Trump/Kushers gain from this personally ?  The hands are not clean on this !
1343599480923287555 2020-12-29 00:47:33 +0800 <melzo36> @kylegriffin1 @ablnk he hasn't cared about 330,000+ dead why would he care about a domestic terrorist ...

1343598615864864781 2020-12-29 00:44:07 +0800 <melzo36> @ANNSISCO1 Definitely needs to be looked at ... McConnell would rather see people in graves before extending a hand to help.  I have yet to come across someone who can intelligently explain why they voted for this man.
1343597871644360704 2020-12-29 00:41:10 +0800 <melzo36> @David_Leavitt shhhhhh...... lets keep quiet 😉

1343548136795459584 2020-12-28 21:23:32 +0800 <melzo36> @politvidchannel @FoxNews First one needs to ask what has @FLOTUS done to deserve to be on a cover of a fashion magazine ?  Spend an insane amount of money on boots ?  She is a horrid woman who deserves no glory !
1343530939104673793 2020-12-28 20:15:12 +0800 <melzo36> @ChrisMurphyCT @senatemajldr would rather see people in graves before approving help that Americans truly need ... how much is McConnell &amp; the Trumps profiting this time ...  McConnell surly is not living off of a gov't pay check and I need a recount no way this maggot won - rigged election
1343529805292027909 2020-12-28 20:10:41 +0800 <melzo36> @grizvacation @ProjectLincoln people who are donating need to have a check up from the neck up and how is this even legal ???

1343375416208191488 2020-12-28 09:57:12 +0800 <melzo36> @IlhanMN Well ... we are not the richest nation in the history of the world ... countries are way ahead of us in health care, technology and education etc ...
1343374232785285120 2020-12-28 09:52:30 +0800 <melzo36> @lipsoneric guess golf was more important than our lives ... sickening!
1343373938101899264 2020-12-28 09:51:20 +0800 <melzo36> @mistergeezy why do people have a problem wearing a mask ?  It's not a violation of ones rights, we are in a global pandemic and its simply caring about fellow human beings.  I have a heart condition, I don't want to get sick due to someone's ignorance ... whats going on with this world ?
1343371602298171394 2020-12-28 09:42:03 +0800 <melzo36> @realDonaldTrump playing games with peoples lives ... POS !!!!
1343248462939222017 2020-12-28 01:32:44 +0800 <melzo36> @realDonaldTrump playing the blame game doesn't work, you need to take responsibility for failure to act quick enough ... now look at the death toll all while you play golf and bet ya have a belly full of food while citizens had little.
1343012140911759361 2020-12-27 09:53:41 +0800 <melzo36> @Donnalee711 wondering does ur aunt have an ipad, phone or computer that you can face time ??  I volunteer with the elderly and its not the same as offering physical comfort but seeing ones face and voice does add a bit of comfort. My thoughts and prayers are with you

1342492337813954561 2020-12-25 23:28:10 +0800 <melzo36> @DavidCornDC and never will be! His only interest is himself &amp; how he and his family profited the last 4 yrs.  I hope they end up bankrupt, all accounts &amp; real estate seized, and that he spends a life time in the courts or in prison...Sad to feel this way, but he sh*tted on us daily.

1341916408913879042 2020-12-24 09:19:38 +0800 <melzo36> @AstralLobo @captmattj love this idea !  Money doesn't need to be spent to show how much they meant to you in a time of need.  Something that comes from the heart will be with them for a life time .
1341912898801549312 2020-12-24 09:05:41 +0800 <melzo36> @Luigipalazzini though interesting Cuomo passed a law that NY state will  prosecute people who have received a presidential pardon at a state level for the same offense as no one is above the law.  Be interesting how this plays out for Manafort/Kushner
1341910339210727424 2020-12-24 08:55:31 +0800 <melzo36> @sandibachom @barbaralay8 A felony ..

1341869439768092672 2020-12-24 06:12:59 +0800 <melzo36> @thomaskaine5 I have my doubts but just a ploy to delay help to those that are desperate for assistance....
1341862105025114112 2020-12-24 05:43:51 +0800 <melzo36> @colvinj don't let them come back ...
1341861931288686592 2020-12-24 05:43:09 +0800 <melzo36> @MeliMels99 shame on store management for not kicking them out or calling the police.  Why is it an issue to wear a mask? How is it a violation of right during a global pandemic ?  These are selfish people who have no concern for the well being of other, the trash of society
1341844253631102977 2020-12-24 04:32:54 +0800 <melzo36> @PrincessBravato I use garlic herb butter rub .. the rosemary and thyme bring out the flavor and so so yummy .. make sure you use the drippings for gravy .. Let us know what time dinner is :)
1341839978448338945 2020-12-24 04:15:55 +0800 <melzo36> @RepMattGaetz Aren't you in public servant ?  The oath you took goes something like serve and protect ... so you basically are saying its ok for people to spread a deadly virus and die ... What kind of dumb fu*k are you ?
1341808636150964225 2020-12-24 02:11:23 +0800 <melzo36> @newtgingrich 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

1341797499137191936 2020-12-24 01:27:07 +0800 <melzo36> @GOP @KLoeffler so imbecile the plan is to do away with Public Schools, public assistance, fire depts, police depts, military , social security ... you do know what socialism is right ?  Every American against it who took a stimulus payment accepted it ... Take the verbiage out of the equation
1341796531368673282 2020-12-24 01:23:17 +0800 <melzo36> @LindseyGrahamSC disgrace ... no voter fraud to the magnitude a Fraud in office claims.  Shame on you !

Shameful we have a gov't that has failed again to take care of its citizens ... Look to other countries as an example of leadership on how citizens are cared for
1341764000258740224 2020-12-23 23:14:01 +0800 <melzo36> @donwinslow I think that's the plan ... and our gov't will sit, watch, cheer him on ... and do nothing but complain about it on twitter....Maybe things will change in the new year with amazing, qualified people nominated in the Biden Admin
1341760149459910662 2020-12-23 22:58:42 +0800 <melzo36> @SenWarren @krnshkr @senatemajldr why was this not the thought process months and months ago ... We can't wait another 8 months for both sides to figure sh*t out ... cut out all the "fluff" and help citizens now !
1341759800338595845 2020-12-23 22:57:19 +0800 <melzo36> @donwinslow tons and tons of nonsense for personal agendas ... when the only agenda item should be helping citizens and small businesses.  To much pocket lining.  Truly have to ask if our gov't really cares ....
1341759054008340487 2020-12-23 22:54:21 +0800 <melzo36> @Manny_Funes should have been the thought process 8 months ago. little late to try and be a leader at this stage. American's are suffering, small business struggling to stay open.  Breaks my heart the growing homeless population, not able to put food on the table.  Does our govt really care ?
1341758217580265480 2020-12-23 22:51:02 +0800 <melzo36> @davidmweissman 100% also would give legal immunity to Putin.  I am beyond disgusted ... Trump has destroyed the meaning of America ...
1341757570898296832 2020-12-23 22:48:28 +0800 <melzo36> @realDonaldTrump a full on lunatic !!!  Trump you lost the election pal ... Biden is moving in on the 20th to clean up the mess you created
1341560426107060224 2020-12-23 09:45:05 +0800 <melzo36> @azfamily total stall tactics ... 8 months to have wishes known - throw out funds for border wall, Space Farce, new missiles, aid to Egypt and Israel and done.  American people need help now @realDonaldTrump @GOP stop playing games with peoples lives!
1341550812497989635 2020-12-23 09:06:53 +0800 <melzo36> @BrianNormoyle @KatCapps Disgusting that war criminals received a pardon ...

1341516794008272896 2020-12-23 06:51:42 +0800 <melzo36> @CoryBooker shall we discuss all the nonsense that is in the bill ... that money is needed to help citizens not private agendas!  The bill is a disgrace, why is it other countries are taking better care of citizens on a monthly basis and we can barely put food on the table...just sad !

About the only thing he accomplished was getting his pocket lined .... The who, what, where and when of how did this man gain so much wealth outside of his wife ... investigation needed

1341398628741558280 2020-12-22 23:02:09 +0800 <melzo36> @kylegriffin1 @PrincessBravato Trump can become a 2x impeached POS.  He failed America, his Oath of Office and no one is doing anything to stop a lunatic but cheer him on ?.... Every single member of the @GOP who supports this lunatic needs to resign ..lets start holding people accountable for their actions.
1341397630153318407 2020-12-22 22:58:11 +0800 <melzo36> remove @realDonaldTrump from office and he can become a 2x impeached POS.  Is this the plan all along to see America Fall .... Trump is Putin's puppet after all .... @SpeakerPelosi America asks for you to do ur job !   https://t.co/5bxHDo7BaV

1341142329181102081 2020-12-22 06:03:43 +0800 <melzo36> @entertained1is Don't understand for this supposedly the greatest country how our gov't sh*ts on us daily.  Other countries r taking care of their citizens no question ... how is it we are begging for help for months &amp; this is all they can do, but had to put needed money to the wall .. disgusted
1341141544699510790 2020-12-22 06:00:36 +0800 <melzo36> @entertained1is This year killed my family financially.  One medical emergency after another, both parents in hospital with Covid, husband lost his job, currently working for far less for a paycheck and I was recently laid off.  Its been a year for the books .. $600 does nothing
1341140802160873472 2020-12-22 05:57:39 +0800 <melzo36> @NBCNews she willingly broke the law...do the time its as simple as that and a hard lesson on life
1341140282583076864 2020-12-22 05:55:35 +0800 <melzo36> @chelseahandler @norisgirl How much is @realDonaldTrump and family profiting this time ?  Fu*k the boarder wall American need this assistance now !  Kushner got a bailout the last go around &amp; wasn't it said no member of the Trump clan was to receive a bailout .. When is this money getting returned ??
1341035202626240512 2020-12-21 22:58:02 +0800 <melzo36> Simply do the job that you were elected to do &amp; the oath you took to better the lives of American Citizens ... if this can't be done resign from public service and let others do the job you failed to do ... @gop @senatemajldr @SpeakerPelosi
1341035040424091648 2020-12-21 22:57:23 +0800 <melzo36> So sick and tired of the blame game ... from both sides  https://t.co/mnGeu2ch9i
1341030119754792960 2020-12-21 22:37:50 +0800 <melzo36> @ossoff A disgrace ! The greatest country supposedly &amp; our gov't sh*ts on us daily.  Why is it that other countries r taking care of citizens on a monthly basis no questions asked ... We are begging for relief to put food on the table, to pay an electric bill .. America is a sad place
1340840290202968066 2020-12-21 10:03:31 +0800 <melzo36> @cmclymer @randomsomewhere why would @senatemajldr care ? He has considerable wealth for someone in public service.  Able to pay essential bills and put food on the table with no worry of eviction or putting a gift under the tree. Who lined his pockets?  Just one more individual who should be investigated
1340828740826238981 2020-12-21 09:17:37 +0800 <melzo36> @SarahBCalif @yogaskidogs @briantylercohen @JoelOsteen receive a bailout as he did, church must be taxed ... A so called pastor who lives in the state of wealth as he does is using god to profit for himself.   #joelOsteen you did what with 4.4 million dollars ?
1340827711552462849 2020-12-21 09:13:32 +0800 <melzo36> @ABC absolutely wonderful to see such diversity in this administration ... should always be this way !
1340827207380320256 2020-12-21 09:11:32 +0800 <melzo36> @samesmail and what if this is the plan all along .... Get Trump elected and see America fall ... Trump left the door wide open for 4 years ... easily manipulated as Putin said ... What will Trump do or sell to rid the mass debt he has .......
1340826381534461952 2020-12-21 09:08:15 +0800 <melzo36> @RBReich we have become a sh*t hole country ... Other countries with far less are taking better care of their citizens than America ... How much do the Trumps profit this time ?
1340825662815277056 2020-12-21 09:05:24 +0800 <melzo36> @NBCNews both sides of the isle should truly be ashamed.  This is suppose to be the "greatest" country and the gov't failed to  take care of its citizens while other countries have stepped up no questions asked. America is not great, its quite sad and only getting worse
1340824765582376960 2020-12-21 09:01:50 +0800 <melzo36> @RepClayHiggins yikes , hopefully this will be used against you in a court of law !  Resign, you do not belong in public service
1340824385872019460 2020-12-21 09:00:19 +0800 <melzo36> @NBCNews @GOP @SpeakerPelosi So how much does the Trump family profit this time ?  Trumps were not to receive any bailout money the last go around and look what Kusher profited ... This money is being returned when ?
1340823495366692864 2020-12-21 08:56:47 +0800 <melzo36> @RepClayHiggins NO EVIDENCE !!!  You know the penalty for sedition ?  You are as pathetic as trump!
1340723532150448128 2020-12-21 02:19:34 +0800 <melzo36> @42_NeedsAQuest @TrueFactsStated Agree ! a man desperate to rid millions if not billions in debt .. what would he do or sell to rid that debt ?  Trump and his family should never be allowed the leave the US.  Kushner is a sneaky SOB
1340712071483195395 2020-12-21 01:34:01 +0800 <melzo36> @NicholsUprising @realDonaldTrump I truly need to understand this cult and why they feel they need to protect a fraud who will turn his back at a moments notice and forget you ever existed.  What has Trump done to keep those supporting him ... Such a disgrace and stain on America.
1340711189764947968 2020-12-21 01:30:31 +0800 <melzo36> @TrueFactsStated I bet it's already planned and how does the secret service go about keeping his mouth shut ???

Glad to see someone in public service putting others before themselves .... and you want to site scripture, you hypocrite POS to society.
1340709452459040768 2020-12-21 01:23:37 +0800 <melzo36> @marcorubio over 300,000 people have died due to ur blatant ignorance!  I ask that you resign from public service !

Trump is a fraud who need to spend the rest of his natural life behind bars.

1340636351465603072 2020-12-20 20:33:08 +0800 <melzo36> @SenatorLankford glad this took priority over people dying, the unemployed, the sick, the homeless .... while other countries are taking care of its citizens no questions asked, American Govt sh*ts on its citizens at every opportunity.... We are desperate for help ... when is it coming?

1340346135152480256 2020-12-20 01:19:55 +0800 <melzo36> @senatemajldr Its going to take more than a 1x payout of $600 to keep food on the table - this is "suppose" to be the greatest country on earth &amp; seems other countries are taking better care of their citizens than the US! America is a sad place never seen so many homeless in my area
1340273022859526145 2020-12-19 20:29:24 +0800 <melzo36> @richardhine @kastacherkim Put them on in jail ! Seize the money

1340270749953638406 2020-12-19 20:20:22 +0800 <melzo36> @melvan1104 @DisguiseDevilin Not by far ... Our Gov't sh*ts on its citizens &amp; plays games w/peoples lives daily...We have other countries that are making sure citizens are able to pay rent, put food on the table and get medical ... all by taxes paid into system .. We pay taxes why are we treated so poorly ?
1340269129228378113 2020-12-19 20:13:56 +0800 <melzo36> @lotsofuss @marylispastit This is to be the "greatest" country yet citizens in other countries are taken care of, no questions asked and we are begging for cost of living increases while politicians are playing games with the lives of citizens.  America is a sad place to live ...

1328849716717633536 2020-11-18 07:57:15 +0800 <melzo36> @MikeJoPro Never used the word President before Trumps name.  He has not honored America and has disgraced not only the position he holds but his oath - I refer to him as individual #1, imbecile and at times just fraud
1328848433503846400 2020-11-18 07:52:10 +0800 <melzo36> @walkinfaith4E @FoxNews good for you, you must have a perfect life where others lost work, not able to get work or other major life circumstances making it a hardship to pay back.  This, by the way is a reduction not wiping out the debt. Many can't get on top of student loan debt due to interest as well
1328846059448139777 2020-11-18 07:42:43 +0800 <melzo36> @tedcruz no you jack a**!
1328821249707888640 2020-11-18 06:04:08 +0800 <melzo36> @JasonMillerinDC @realDonaldTrump a memory card ??  From what ?  sounds like somethings been tampered to favor the fraud in office

1328682391854927877 2020-11-17 20:52:22 +0800 <melzo36> @12News simple answer ... yes ! People are not following following the guidelines as it is.  Was at Fry's yesterday and seen 3-4 people with no masks, cashiers at various stores stopped wiping down areas etc...we will never get on top of this deadly virus if people don't act responsibly
1328498683508244480 2020-11-17 08:42:23 +0800 <melzo36> @SenatorLankford are these more lies like ensuring America you would act by Friday to move along Biden's access for transition into office ??  Why are you so afraid of Trump??  Just another GOP Fraud...
1328497990646910978 2020-11-17 08:39:37 +0800 <melzo36> @SenatorLankford YOU LIED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And this is the @GOP  James Lankford Says ‘Not In A Hurry’ to Give Joe Biden Intelligence Briefings  https://t.co/w8BnGgj7De via @YahooNews

Nothing to the extent where Pharmaceutical companies don't want his hands on anything.  Rally's that further spread the virus causing more deaths. You mean that effective response?

1328334506491736064 2020-11-16 21:50:00 +0800 <melzo36> @JasonMillerinDC yes and a reminder that Pfizer didn’t want  trumps dirty hands associated with them !
1328334271241539584 2020-11-16 21:49:04 +0800 <melzo36> @BillOReilly oh please what BS!
1328334120729026561 2020-11-16 21:48:28 +0800 <melzo36> @realDonaldTrump YOU DID NOT WIN !! please get some help, mental illness calls for the 25th
1328088278386446337 2020-11-16 05:31:34 +0800 <melzo36> @GOP stop the stupidity !!!!
1328049304292843520 2020-11-16 02:56:42 +0800 <melzo36> @davidmweissman simple put - His personal attorney Barr said a sitting POTUS can not be indicted ....Trump has the law after him and only way to stop it, is to be re-elected.  Trump will be bankrupt.
1328023274689753088 2020-11-16 01:13:16 +0800 <melzo36> @realDonaldTrump Biden did win in one of the most secure elections in history.... The fake new is YOU and BTW you fraudulently won 2016 with the help of Russia.  Please step back and let competent people step in ... you failed on covid, you failed America !! Simple as that !
1327774849972912128 2020-11-15 08:46:07 +0800 <melzo36> @danielsgoldman Unfortunately, America can’t wait until then ... thousands and thousands more sick and thousands dying... that in itself should be enough for people to get up and respond to this crisis... we would be in a better position if Trump took this seriously!
1327721654760337408 2020-11-15 05:14:45 +0800 <melzo36> @realDonaldTrump Totally false !!!!  daily disgrace!
1327678132904554497 2020-11-15 02:21:48 +0800 <melzo36> @BillyCorben @KatCapps sorry, she needs 4 SS agents to protected her miserable ass ...
1327677626664685568 2020-11-15 02:19:47 +0800 <melzo36> @altoth_99 Definitely the Trump Cult - extremely scary the number of people who feel his actions and behavior are acceptable especially for the highest office ....
1327672413916598273 2020-11-15 01:59:05 +0800 <melzo36> @PressSec might want to heed to your own advice sweetie..... Trump lost will have no 2nd term....face the facts and address America is accurate information ... not lies !
1327644214465761280 2020-11-15 00:07:01 +0800 <melzo36> @mjfree I have my doubts about this, but stranger things have happened. Pardon is federal, majority was pushed to state to complete investigations.  This will leave Trump bankrupt and possible jail. Loan fraud, campaign fraud, sexual assaults, Muller findings etc etc etc all state
1327642479621935106 2020-11-15 00:00:08 +0800 <melzo36> @ShelbyKStewart Pfizer did not want the Trump name on anything. Therefore declined funding offered to them by USA.  They sought out funding elsewhere and believe they are providing to USA for free
1327641622754992128 2020-11-14 23:56:43 +0800 <melzo36> sad reality of the USA! #TeamBidenHarris #TrumpTrain #trumplost
1327640843671408642 2020-11-14 23:53:38 +0800 <melzo36> @realDonaldTrump Well the @GOP @senatemajldr  needs to get their sh*t together and stop adding bs to the bill to pass it.  Little to late to try and be a leader ....
1327609713375076353 2020-11-14 21:49:56 +0800 <melzo36> @GeorgePapa19 totally false statement.  Military will follow command ...on a personal level majority have extreme disgust for Trump.  Trump does not uphold oath of office or respect to country.
1327370626982584320 2020-11-14 05:59:53 +0800 <melzo36> @realDonaldTrump CONCEDE !!! you lost !
1327370426176086017 2020-11-14 05:59:05 +0800 <melzo36> @owermohle Pfizer doesn’t want Trumps name on anything ....
1327370193555783680 2020-11-14 05:58:10 +0800 <melzo36> @realDonaldTrump just stop!!! you lost !!!!!
1327348658484854784 2020-11-14 04:32:35 +0800 <melzo36> @TrueFactsStated he will not be missed
1327328353100075010 2020-11-14 03:11:54 +0800 <melzo36> avoiding the law is the only reason why Trump wants a 2nd term at any cost !! .. his personal attorney #Barr helped with a sitting POTUS can’t be indicted when in fact no one is above the law
1327327446278889473 2020-11-14 03:08:18 +0800 <melzo36> @realDonaldTrump WAS FAIR AND YOU LOST !!! Plain and simple
1327327207711072262 2020-11-14 03:07:21 +0800 <melzo36> @politvidchannel @PressSec so delusional... trump lost the election ... meaning will be no second term .. stop playing games
1327321864100671488 2020-11-14 02:46:07 +0800 <melzo36> @azfamily absolutely sickening!  these are the very types of people that don’t belong in society and deserve the death penalty
1327289552206086144 2020-11-14 00:37:43 +0800 <melzo36> @tedcruz so full of sh*t as usual...
1327289132872204290 2020-11-14 00:36:03 +0800 <melzo36> @DonaldJTrumpJr hmmmmm...number of people in the trump administration tied to Russia ....counting all past / present individuals!!!
1327288693757943811 2020-11-14 00:34:19 +0800 <melzo36> @DonaldJTrumpJr no but the trumps certainly are
1327260230950940672 2020-11-13 22:41:13 +0800 <melzo36> @realDonaldTrump MENTALLY UNSTABLE——YOU LOST THE ELECTION !!!!!
1327259941502062592 2020-11-13 22:40:04 +0800 <melzo36> @GOP TRUMP LOST THE ELECTION
1327255913225351170 2020-11-13 22:24:03 +0800 <melzo36> @SenatorLankford @KKBSTHEBOSS1 thank you for stepping up and doing what’s right for the Biden transition ...
1327055412995137536 2020-11-13 09:07:20 +0800 <melzo36> @RWPUSA Why is the @GOP so scared of Trump?
1327054717717934080 2020-11-13 09:04:34 +0800 <melzo36> @DonaldJTrumpJr one dumb ass to another ....
1327054460753899520 2020-11-13 09:03:33 +0800 <melzo36> @grandmagrit his mass amount of lawsuits will bankrupt him. Campaign fraud, loan fraud, sexual assaults etc etc. Deutsche Bank will start repossession in Jan.  Millions unable to pay. Winning the election would stop this and only reason he desperately wants to win at any cost
1327052997654839296 2020-11-13 08:57:44 +0800 <melzo36> @Acyn @RandPaul  I know ur not to bright and obviously not listening ... no sound evidence that people remain immune .... no sound evidence that a vaccine is a long term solution ... People have been infected 2 to 3 times with covid ....
1327050967850700800 2020-11-13 08:49:40 +0800 <melzo36> @davidjoachim @CalebMelby @business financial dealings of 500 LLC - would be quite telling  - follow the money !
1327050337505538048 2020-11-13 08:47:10 +0800 <melzo36> @JohnCornyn so wise up and realize this was a fair election in which Trump lost .. maybe uphold ur oath and hold trump accountable instead of running scared.  You work for America not party...maybe its times you realize that.
1327049630383710208 2020-11-13 08:44:21 +0800 <melzo36> @DonaldJTrumpJr just more bs from a fraud.  Breitbart is not news
1327049007454056448 2020-11-13 08:41:53 +0800 <melzo36> @nypost Well the NY Post  is not credible news and this would be such a disrespect to Trebek... would never happen..
1327047412855128064 2020-11-13 08:35:33 +0800 <melzo36> @GOPChairwoman @GOP @TeamTrump TRUMP LOST PENNSYLVANIA .....
1327032644731772928 2020-11-13 07:36:52 +0800 <melzo36> @JennaEllisEsq WTF - basically you are saying that everyone who voted did so fraudulently.  ballots were counted Biden won...NOTHING TO PROVE!  The level of voter fraud you claim exist, just doesn't ... no widespread evidence.  Plain and simple the FRAUD was voted out
1327018951780442112 2020-11-13 06:42:27 +0800 <melzo36> @P4boxers @Well1la I love seeing the diversity within the transition team ... its a warm welcome.  I hope to see this within the administration.  Intelligent people come from all cultures and life styles

I prefer someone who takes the high road with respect, dignity and class .... that is the ultimate killer to a narcissist.  Restoring respect in the highest office.

1323061442224902145 2020-11-02 08:36:43 +0800 <melzo36> @robertapeasel @xvnderXX @JoeBiden Hunter computer's is fake ... I am aware of the Biden brother while no family is perfect Trump has surpassed many of the crime front.  With Trumps mounting debt I am more concerned what he would do to rid that debt.  Trump &amp; Clan are under many state/Fed investigations for fraud.

We only know a small percentage of trump foreign dealings, with all the ongoing investigations and ones under wraps Russia could face some stringent sanctions under a new administration.  Trump can be easily manipulated as Putin said, Biden/Harris not.

1321436279632883712 2020-10-28 20:58:54 +0800 <melzo36> @NBCNews Should have been a key indicator that Trump does not care about them.  No empathy

Trump is done, he knows it and the best thing he can do for himself is find a law firm to represent him.  Hey maybe Barr can officially do that ... He will be without a job soon
1321425232725331971 2020-10-28 20:15:01 +0800 <melzo36> @DonaldJTrumpJr Yes the Trumps are all corrupt and compromised!

Since he continue to profit from the secret service do you really think he cares about them...his actions this past weekend made it crystal clear.
1313232437950914561 2020-10-06 05:39:46 +0800 <melzo36> From @realDonaldTrump "Don't be afraid of Covid. Don't let it dominate your life," tell that to the 210k+ dead .... imbecile

Trump who supposedly tested positive leaves Walter Reid to boost his ego putting lives at risk.  My prayers are with the secret service.  Lets hope they don't get sick or their families.  This imbecile should be tossed out of the WH for this negligent behavior!
1312887234542985217 2020-10-05 06:48:03 +0800 <melzo36> @GeoffRBennett @InSpiteOfTrump "if" he truly tested positive he is one ignorant SOB to put lives at risk.  This goes beyond irresponsibility ... besides he is not even wearing the right type of mask for someone who tested positive.  That vehicle is infected and those in it.
1312886491203338240 2020-10-05 06:45:06 +0800 <melzo36> @JasonMillerinDC After Trumps blatant ignorance stunt ..... I hope this plays 24-7 showing Trump having no regard for others.

1312882462368829440 2020-10-05 06:29:05 +0800 <melzo36> @BeschlossDC @adallos its called absolute ignorance, no regard for anyone but himself.  He should be thrown out of the WH for this act alone.
1312882106356256770 2020-10-05 06:27:40 +0800 <melzo36> @PhilipWegmann absolute ignorance ... Put lives at risk, esp his security detail...when does the insanity stop

1312853838139777024 2020-10-05 04:35:21 +0800 <melzo36> @kylegriffin1 @lahtay44 Biden "WILL" win popular vote and electoral vote  - Regardless, Trump will take this to the Supreme Court .... I have a feeling he will not go quietly and will be surprised if he does.  If Biden looses should be grave concern over another rigged election.
1312852705916772352 2020-10-05 04:30:51 +0800 <melzo36> @CNN oh please more BS .. Biden is often wearing a mask in public places long before the fraud got sick....BTW by the timeline ... Trump knew he tested positive at the debate.
1312852138498822144 2020-10-05 04:28:36 +0800 <melzo36> @tedcruz @CBSNews oh please this was found to be false.....Try holding @realDonaldTrump accountable for sexual assault.  Bet these women would like justice!

Not to mention the 1.1 billion he owes...those pesky crimes are knocking on his door.  BTW America should be asking how was he eligible to run for office on the mass debt
1312849632519573504 2020-10-05 04:18:38 +0800 <melzo36> @mattgaetz I hope he recovers to spend the rest of his natural life in the courts to answer for his crimes
1312849396686495744 2020-10-05 04:17:42 +0800 <melzo36> @mattgaetz keep praying because America is not.  NO sympathy for this man, this Trump family who failed to protect America, failed to show empathy to the 200k+ dead.  My sympathy is with those that did not ask to die from this virus and the one grieving loss of a loved one.....not Trump !
1312848835614449665 2020-10-05 04:15:28 +0800 <melzo36> @DonaldJTrumpJr oh please what bullshit.... @BreitbartNews  is fake news ....  nothing but propaganda BS

1312814084450971648 2020-10-05 01:57:23 +0800 <melzo36> @4YrsToday anyone who clicked yes needs to look in the mirror and question ones morals and values...someone who sexually assaults women, loan fraud, pathological liar... the list goes on and on.... The only interest this man has in winning is to save his ass from the lifetime in the court.
