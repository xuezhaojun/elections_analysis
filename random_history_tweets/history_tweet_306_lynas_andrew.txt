1344052910150344704 2020-12-30 06:49:19 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Eddie_Explores Lol, UK TV is way more open to sex than US TV has ever been. We just don't go on about it constantly. When we see it over here, we go meh. When you see it, you lose your minds.
1344050072665923592 2020-12-30 06:38:03 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @synthesighs Yeah, we are all just falsely boosting your ego on social media, so that if the one in a million chance of us actually meeting irl happens, you'll be nice to us.
1344048532706177024 2020-12-30 06:31:56 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Why does it take twitter 72hrs max to tell you that they think an account didn't break their t&amp;c's (when it blatantly has), but it takes them 6 weeks for them to agree that an account has?
1344040709498802181 2020-12-30 06:00:50 +0800 <lynas_andrew> The 10,000th "viral tweet" that then has these as the add on "promotion" tweet..  Yawn, yawn, yawn.
1344038986440986630 2020-12-30 05:54:00 +0800 <lynas_andrew> In March the government built the Nightingales knowing there was no one to staff them, purely to say "we have the capacity". Most of them have already been dismantled. I wonder if all the temp morgues that were built are still available...
1344037606712082433 2020-12-30 05:48:31 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity Sorry people. I wore my new 3rd shirt for the first time today. I'm the jinx..

1344035429620834307 2020-12-30 05:39:52 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @benwilliamsbutt I have dodgy internet, so this season I've kept my £10'ers &amp; just listened on the radio. It is equally as painful (I just feel it about 30 seconds earlier). At least it's only my heart that hurts.
1344033458360885248 2020-12-30 05:32:02 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @indyfromspace I used to work at McDonald's. I served a bloke in the Drive Thru &amp; as his car pulled away, I saw writing on the side that said 'Vauxhall are proud sponsors of Phil DeFreitas' He was my cricketing hero.  A few months later I served the entire Australian Rugby League Team.

Sometimes that gets me burnt, but they have to burn me. When I'm depressed, I spot the box of matches when it's still in their pocket.

1341500407319769088 2020-12-23 05:46:35 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @HoogAdem @BristolCity I was referred to a MHP 3-4 yrs ago (memory is a bit foggy). She said "well you've survived so far without attempting suicide, so crack on doing what your doing, it's worked so far". This yr is the 1st time I've felt alive, and that little things actually register, so win/win.
1341489501093437440 2020-12-23 05:03:15 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I'm actually now crying my eyes out, when I thought I'd handled this year well.  Obviously I didn't quite manage that.  It's always the little things that affect you the most (like a long forgotten football shirt purchase).

1341432174516551681 2020-12-23 01:15:27 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I just queued to get into Tesco for the 1st time since March. Unlike March though, 90% of people haven't got a trolley, so at least they aren't needlessly stockpiling, but they aren't social distancing any more either. Got some tobacco &amp; got out.

1339727326913949696 2020-12-18 08:21:00 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I'm out walking past midnight in mid winter &amp; the sky looks like it would at dusk. Storm incoming.

You have a FPTP system, you have to vote for the Dem or the Rep, what they stand for is secondary. It was either Trump or whoever the Dems stood against him.

1339006697608802305 2020-12-16 08:37:28 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @misslucyp The Canary is run by a Jewish woman &amp; her wife. It only reason it gets demonised, is because they both stand up for Socialism, peace &amp; justice. Whether that be in the UK, Palestine, or anywhere else in the world.
1339004323888570369 2020-12-16 08:28:02 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @RealPatrick_M @briebriejoy But still the only option other than Trump. In the UK, the Labour party are almost identical to the Conservative party. Yet Keith Abstaimer is still slightly better than Boris Johnson.

When you actually offer something other than being dismissive, then I might have something on which to meet you half way. Anyway it's gone midnight on a school night, so enjoy your evening, I'm off to bed.

1338986287873859592 2020-12-16 07:16:22 +0800 <lynas_andrew> What?? In the space of three months we've gone from one of the lowest risk areas in the country, to one of the highest!! Obviously this is what happens when people get complacent. #HandsFaceSpace

1338975046371512325 2020-12-16 06:31:42 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @StoicHorse @heathercampbell I live in the UK, on the political spectrum I'm working with, you've dismissed all the other options. Alex Jones is a grifter. I'd rather believe 50,000 Chinese soldiers got MOAB'd in Maine, than pay any attention to him.
1338970906924871680 2020-12-16 06:15:15 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @StoicHorse @heathercampbell All of that is from your previous tweets. No assumptions made.
1338968535192756227 2020-12-16 06:05:50 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @StoicHorse @heathercampbell You don't like communists, socialists, lefties, democrats &amp; centrists. That rules out all options other than the far right. I think you don't understand yourself.
1338965323832242178 2020-12-16 05:53:04 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @StoicHorse @heathercampbell Now I understand you. You see anything that isn't far right as being communist. In the real world that isn't true. Democracy isn't communism. Democracy is what every sane person wants, after that it's 'do you want democracy for everyone, or just the top 5%'
1338918696102866947 2020-12-16 02:47:47 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @StoicHorse @heathercampbell Maybe that you don't realise that you are right wing, and you are using that denialism in order to blame the left for everything,. Every though the left hasn't been in government in either the US or UK for over forty years?
1338899809479110658 2020-12-16 01:32:44 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Just popped to big Tesco for food shopping. It is rammed on a Tuesday teatime?? This is the problem with sticking rural areas into tier 3. People have nowhere else to go, everyone is Xmas shopping in the one place open to them. Sod the food, I grabbed a few G&amp;T's and got out.
1338898034177024000 2020-12-16 01:25:41 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @StoicHorse @heathercampbell No. What is scary is that libertarians/centrists claim progressivism to get votes, and the media amplify that, instead of holding them to account. Neoliberalism has had a 40 yr run, it doesn't work, yet everyone is too invested in it to admit it.
1338886100874633216 2020-12-16 00:38:16 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Woke up to a Post Office slip in my hallway. 'item too big for your letterbox'  I have everything delivered to work...  Oh god, whatever thing that my mother has knitted me during lockdown, she's posted it.  I'm too scared to collect it.

As soon as they got into power, who were the first group of people they incarcerated??? Ooh, that's right, the trade unions &amp; socialists.

It mutates everytime someone catches it, some of them work &amp; spread like this one, most don't. Don't worry too much, just keep social distancing &amp; get the vaccine when it's offered.

1338631109874245635 2020-12-15 07:45:01 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Zimb0 @heathercampbell The only dossier that had been leaked, showed how the parliamentary labour party deliberately sabotaged two General Elections to stop a socialist becoming Prime Minister. Huawei 5G? You need to take that one up with the Tory Government. Nowt to do with socialists.
1338629293396652035 2020-12-15 07:37:48 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @StoicHorse @heathercampbell It is a weird fear. You are still psychologically scarred from your McCarthyism era propaganda.
1338628471149486082 2020-12-15 07:34:32 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Zimb0 @heathercampbell The English are scared of socialism, that's why they are doing everything they can to demonise Jeremy Corbyn &amp; why the "dem/soc" Labour party are forcing their socialist membership out.

1338533231432445967 2020-12-15 01:16:05 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @DawnHFoster I make that the 4th new European strain (then there's the other Americas &amp; Asian strains), as long as it isn't too dissimilar to the others already circulating, the vaccine should still work fine.
1338526804404006926 2020-12-15 00:50:33 +0800 <lynas_andrew> This was on FB about 5 yrs ago.. It's nonsense. Your screen uses three colours, all 39 colours on this chart are made from those three. Everyone with fully working RGB cones in their eyes will see all 39 colours. You don't have a 4th cone.

1338303896771588098 2020-12-14 10:04:48 +0800 <lynas_andrew> So I've been out walking tonight. Got absolutely drowned twice, but in-between, the clouds cleared enough for me to spend 30ish minutes to look out for the Geminids. Managed to see about half a dozen. So I made the same wish half a dozen times.

1337516382347554821 2020-12-12 05:55:30 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @socalledcharlie I click on the fleets just to clear them off my feed. Then I see your arse. Fleets can occasionally be good.
1337491299830804484 2020-12-12 04:15:49 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @damian_from @ThatCorbynista @Keir_Starmer @UKLabour I haven't voted because I lived through New Labour. If the press says he is (and he's a Blair clone) he will win the next election. We need yet another party to split the vote further. If Abstarmer can only get in by coalition with a socialist party, then we can push for PR.

1337188220895944710 2020-12-11 08:11:30 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @joey_cuppa I just checked, so am I. Who blocks a caterpillar from 1970s children's TV?
1337138035864072199 2020-12-11 04:52:05 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Michael_Dunn4 Cyclist twitter. My view that they shouldn't endanger pedestrians by using pedestrian only pavements/footpaths, is apparently wrong. Them injuring pedestrians is fine if it means they don't have to worry about paying attention to other road traffic.
1337054193861980160 2020-12-10 23:18:55 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @bethanyusher I'm 48.

I literally only play, Elite/Oolite CM 03-04 Civ2/Alpha Centuri Railway Tycoon If I can be bothered to dig out my PS2, I'll play Grand Turismo 2. DON'T BUY ANY MORE GAMES!!!

1334986271958163457 2020-12-05 06:21:44 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I've always known that my brain &amp; body were separate, my body is just life support for the brain I live in. Tonight I broke down 'the brain I live in'. I don't live in my brain. I am I. The body I have is the life support for the brain I have, which in turn is my life support.

I've chatted with Katy Montgomery on here &amp; she often can't see her own beauty (and we all know she's stunning). If only we could all swap eyes &amp; see ourselves as others see us. Until then, just take our words as gospel, you are beautiful xx.

They are only selling a Vocation x SureShot double IPA called 15 Mile Round Trip. Coincidence..  who knows? It's 8% mind 🚶🚶🚶🍺🤯🤯

I only have free #SpotifyWrapped2020, so if this was my favourite song of the year (listened to 36 times in one day), it's because your algorithm played it to me so freaking often.

1332448233667309573 2020-11-28 06:16:29 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Time to put my phone on silent. I now have three weeks off work, just as we leave Lockdown 2 and go straight into Tier 3..  So lots of days sitting in my pants playing CM 03/04, Civ2, the original Elite, whilst eating nothing but chocolate, crisps &amp; cake. I think I shall enjoy.
1332425035169017857 2020-11-28 04:44:18 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I just wandered down to see the new railway bridge. Six months ago two cars struggled to pass each other under the old one. You could have a motorway passing under this new one.
1332382379923697669 2020-11-28 01:54:48 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Oh my, this heated gilet is wonderful. The best £20 I've ever spent. Three heat settings (25C, 35C &amp; 45C) &amp; 9 heat pads. I told the boss that I reckon the company should supply them as winter workwear.

1332057598342918146 2020-11-27 04:24:14 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @PJWillx The Lost Cosmonauts is in Tesco, but they are only selling them as single cans (but the larger size, not the 330's), and they aren't on a buy x for y deal) ☹️
1332024034645725185 2020-11-27 02:10:52 +0800 <lynas_andrew> A few months ago I discovered Sputnik IPA, a nice smooth beer, but I preferred Vocations Life &amp; Death taste. I've just discovered Lost Cosmonauts.. It's the perfect taste balance between the two, 6% and has the same grippy can label as Sputnik, so you don't accidentally drop it.

1329891780058288135 2020-11-21 04:58:03 +0800 <lynas_andrew> So are any of you actually using this "fleet" thing? It appeared on my twitter this morning, and non of the first dozen pfp's it showed were people I've interacted with recently. Now it's showing people I have, but not all of them. Do fleets also appear on my normal timeline?
1329888126735687682 2020-11-21 04:43:32 +0800 <lynas_andrew> After the next cycle case 1 68%, case 2 98%, so now 13% free battery power. And this is when I found out the gods of Physics live on New Zealand time. On the next cycle, both charging cases stopped working...
1329868180962111490 2020-11-21 03:24:16 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I forgot it was Black Friday.  The selling of non-essentials as long as you are selling essentials, is being pushed to lunacy.  If you only want a 55" 4K TV, then you shouldn't be able to buy one as we are in lockdown.  At least buy a trolley full of food at the same time.
1329831898978381846 2020-11-21 01:00:06 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Case 2 back to 98% case 1 still 60%. I've gained 5% free battery power after 1 1/2 cycles??? Case 2 disconnected, but still charging case 1...
1329822622578843649 2020-11-21 00:23:14 +0800 <lynas_andrew> 1st case now 60% 2nd case back to 80% so I'm now connecting them back together...
1329820591386406916 2020-11-21 00:15:10 +0800 <lynas_andrew> 1st one still 55% 2nd one 98% so I'm now taking that one off charge, but still using it the charge the 1st case...
1329814972197711872 2020-11-20 23:52:50 +0800 <lynas_andrew> This shouldn't be physically possible. I've two sets of earphones with recharging cases. One case was at 55% charge, the other at 80% charge. I wired them to charge each other up. 30 mins later, the 1st one still says 55%, the other now says 93%...
1329536595775647746 2020-11-20 05:26:40 +0800 <lynas_andrew> This is a lie. I've had several gins &amp; a couple of beers. This is exactly how I thought they would sound.

Having the I on LGBTI, is not lumping them in with the LGBT, as intersex IS completely different, just as the T IS completely different from LGB. Yet we can be one community, all standing up for each other, and LGBTI shows that solidarity

The T has nothing to do with LGB. If you don't want Intersex included in the LGBTI umbrella, then that is your choice. I will always be an intersex ally, whether or not you want my support.

The issue is that consent was never explicitly asked from ANY patient until the '90s. Everything before then was for the benefit of human knowledge, without ANY permission, and it's now freely available online. This is not an LGBTI issue.
1329212387086491650 2020-11-19 07:58:23 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @KatyMontgomerie I totally get where you are coming from, but we don't see you as you see you. I'd love for us to swap eyes for 2 mins, and then we both might get to see what our brains don't.
1329206798453235717 2020-11-19 07:36:10 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @crankypacifist @KatyMontgomerie Don't you mean.. HOW THE HELL DO YOU MAKE IT LOOK SO DAMNED EASY!!!!!!
1329200127349809164 2020-11-19 07:09:40 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Pirate_Kitty79 @KatyMontgomerie @Delilahdern A doctor took multiple photo's of me, which he said he was going to use in an article he was submitting to The Lancet. I was 7 yrs old.  My ok then, was sufficient. He didn't even ask my parents.
1329199280704380929 2020-11-19 07:06:18 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Pirate_Kitty79 @KatyMontgomerie @Delilahdern Although in the '70s, verbal was enough. I got a severe case of Rheumatic fever in the '70s. I displayed all the worst visible symptoms. As it is usually a follow on complication of Scarlet fever, which I hadn't had, and there hadn't been many cases of Scarlet fever (1/..)
1329180467422179328 2020-11-19 05:51:33 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Opened the fridge. Ooh I forgot I bought that, oh, use by yesterday. Ooh I forgot I bought those, also use by yesterday. Guess who's eating fish &amp; mushrooms for supper....
1329176556326019073 2020-11-19 05:36:00 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I cut my hair off when my marriage broke down 12ish yrs ago. Tonight I'm stood in my living room head banging for the first time in years. I miss having hair that reached past my arse. You can't windmill with 1 inch hair. But can I be arsed with the hassle of growing it again?
1329174887416680458 2020-11-19 05:29:22 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @sburton84 @Transsomething @KatyMontgomerie I used it in 97/98, mine didn't look like that. It definitely didn't have the topics thing on the left. The right hand menu is familiar, but with too many options. The middle box is wrong as well, I had a slim chat box, and the names appeared below it.
1329150361790259201 2020-11-19 03:51:55 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I'm not saying the last three days in work have been fecking hard graft, but I finished work 3 1/2 hrs ago &amp; I'm already on my 8th can of G&amp;T, and it's still early evening.

Anyone who you were connected with, their name popped up with either a green icon next to it (online &amp; open to chat) or a red icon (online but do not disturb).

1328751351661293569 2020-11-18 01:26:23 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Cool! One of my longest friends, we met in college 27yrs ago, has just text me. She's only gone and moved from Warrington to Exeter to run a pub in the city centre. I can see long drunken weekends ahead.

1328427088550965248 2020-11-17 03:57:53 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Just had a chat with me dad on't phone. All is well at his end of Merseyside, although he's getting bored of doing jigsaw puzzles. Me mam on the other hand has spent the last 8 months knitting &amp; is still going strong. I dread whatever it is she has knitted for me.
1328105298456944640 2020-11-16 06:39:12 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @FreeNorthNow No one has been charged with sedition since the early'70s. It stopped being a crime in 2009.

At work, my boss could say " you couldn't care less" And I can reply " I could, I'm here aren't I?" Both phrases are valid, but have slightly different meanings.

I find it extremely disrespectful when people don’t stand for the national anthem. As soon as you hear "Drink up thee cider George, pass us round the mug” you need to be OUT of your fucking seat.

The judge politely asks him to stop masticating. The juror blushes, apologies to the judge, and takes his hands out of his pockets.

1326654720614797318 2020-11-12 06:35:08 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Just after I'd forked out on the new phone, I received a phone call... The ear speaker has magically started working again.  Oh well, at least I've bought myself a xmas present
1326654719268450314 2020-11-12 06:35:07 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Oh, the other thing that happened to me today. The ear speaker on my phone died a few weeks ago, so had to use earphones to take a call. Saw a brand new phone I liked, but it only got released today. Got it cheap as the release tied in with "Chinese singles day sale"

1326622432090845187 2020-11-12 04:26:49 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @MindTendencies2 I forgave my parents 30 yrs ago. Yet every time I see them, they still come up with the same old, same old. Every visit, I have to put them back in their box/press reset, and only then can I enjoy seeing them again.
1326603717429374981 2020-11-12 03:12:27 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Tonight's phone call.

I'll be there in about a 1 1/2 hrs" Me "No, I finished at 4 &amp; I've just cracked open my 5th G&amp;T"

1326311720055427075 2020-11-11 07:52:10 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @timshires @TheExiledRobin It's a little known FA rule, but if play is stopped for an injury, and the player needs ambulance assistance, if it doesn't arrive within 30 mins, the game is abandoned. It happened last week in a non league game in Warrington.  90 mins is taking the micky though.
1326309795960397828 2020-11-11 07:44:31 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @comedy_joey So did I, but there was only one prize, it wasn't one for everyone who didn't get liked/retweeted etc.
1326308537836908545 2020-11-11 07:39:31 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Nice one Eva 😂😂

I was listening to the radio commentary of a game involving my hometown team Warrington Town (@theyellows) a week or so ago. The same thing happened. Game abandoned due to the wait for an ambulance to attend.  Best wishes Hunty.
1326303912777961475 2020-11-11 07:21:08 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @joss_prior Don't worry love, I thought it would start going downhill after 45. I was wrong. It started way before then, I just never noticed. Stay sassy, it will keep you feeling young.

1326253290741518340 2020-11-11 03:59:59 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SubtleInternal Me as well. I lost my wallet. Two hours of retracing my steps through the woods, nothing. Last ditch, tried the big Tesco to see if it had been handed in there. It had..

1326250384424366081 2020-11-11 03:48:26 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Theopenofmind1 @jimmynimble @Rachael_Swindon I was born in '72. A girl who was 1 yr older than me, lived across the road. She was disabled because of Thalidomide. Yeah, rushed pharmaceuticals destroys lives.
1326206572356362241 2020-11-11 00:54:21 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Walking home &amp; a 2nd project manager calls me. Which means tomorrow morning, I now have two fans that need cleaning, at the same time. Little Tesco's is about to get a larger gin purchase than normal.
1326200292573057025 2020-11-11 00:29:24 +0800 <lynas_andrew> When your phone rings 30 mins before you're due to finish work and you glance at it &amp; it's a project manager calling you... You know something has hit the fan somewhere.

1326122062000369664 2020-11-10 19:18:32 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @jimmynimble @Rachael_Swindon I do, but if I read the article correctly, the claim is based on 94 people from a trial of 43,500. That is not statistically strong enough for me.
1326119652490178561 2020-11-10 19:08:57 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @mthr_jo @ShuliElisheva You can see a fair chuck of the track/bridge at the front, there's nothing at the back, even what might be bridge supports look offset.

1325874693216350208 2020-11-10 02:55:35 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I'm enjoying walking around the woods in the dark (and the rain). Listening to good music, I can see absolutely nothing till I shine the torch that way, and observe my surroundings in a different way. I can't wait till my new phone turns up &amp; I do this just using night vision.
1325867288961179649 2020-11-10 02:26:09 +0800 <lynas_andrew> The difference between lockdowns 1&amp;2 is that the woods petrichor is completely different.

No one is taking real money, so I waited till I needed tobacco before cashing them, as the supermarket takes them off the total. Nope, she insisted giving me coins &amp; I pay for the baccy by card. So I kept me gob shut as she gave me £7.50

Some official sources say far right terrorist attacks have been more prevalent (which is definitely true in the USA), some class white Christian offenders as not being terrorists, but all Muslims were. It's how you interpret the data.

1323365349467840512 2020-11-03 04:44:20 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @sammie_grace70 Wibble.
1323365012229029889 2020-11-03 04:43:00 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @CateSpice No need. I just looked at her page. Banner photo &amp; bio told me all I needed to know.
1323363254123548673 2020-11-03 04:36:01 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @WhoisJessicaB @Sarah_Samedi I've only got a T Rex greatest hits and a definitive Marc Bolan album. Oddly there is only the odd song that overlaps. So I have about 30ish songs, I love them all. My soft spot is 'New York City' I have a thing for frogs.
1323359679544725506 2020-11-03 04:21:49 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @MissSp00n @portushead @Chr1stinaG @KaraLG84 It was the day after Halloween tbf. I can "just" about understand why some people got fixated on severed heads...
1323358836384796674 2020-11-03 04:18:28 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @WhoisJessicaB @Sarah_Samedi I'd never heard that before... OMG. Thanks. I only got into T Rex/Marc Bolan in my 30's (Metal Guru was no 1 over here when I was born) but got into Bowie in mid teens &amp; loved Placebo from when they started.  Cheers again for sharing that.

1323350433054793731 2020-11-03 03:45:04 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @WhoisJessicaB @Sarah_Samedi Yes, and brilliant collaborations. Placebo's "Without You I'm Nothing" was only released as a single because Bowie got in touch and said he wanted to sing it with them.  https://t.co/8nHMFbSRp4
1323347840719036421 2020-11-03 03:34:46 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @FreeNorthNow tbf, although we are going to be a republic, I still think the symbolism of the Tudor Rose uniting Lancashire with Yorkshire, would be more fitting. No division between rivals standing shoulder to shoulder as one.
1323345152581259264 2020-11-03 03:24:05 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @WhoisJessicaB @Sarah_Samedi It's a beautiful song. I remember a conversation I had with her where we both agreed that cover songs of David Bowie were automatically wrong, with the exception of Helden.

1323342034359508992 2020-11-03 03:11:42 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @malteaser_80 Yes could be, you have a silly number of motorways. Our weather has been horrendous as well, but heard no blues &amp; twos today. Our hospitals were shown as one of the 1st to get swamped (lower capacity). Either way it's not looking good.
1323337812570243076 2020-11-03 02:54:55 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @HoogAdem Sorry. (A little sarcasm emoji works wonders on a text site).
1323337355361718274 2020-11-03 02:53:06 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Ambulance services in the North West can no longer cope with the number of calls being made. Shit is going to get scary nationwide very soon if this lockdown doesn't work.
1323336791299117056 2020-11-03 02:50:52 +0800 <lynas_andrew> It's a Monday night, these are calls from people's houses.
1323336453741547522 2020-11-03 02:49:31 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @HoogAdem Hospitals are not empty. Daily admissions are not the same as ICU capacity.  https://t.co/0ADIdv11ig

Refs don't usually give us free kicks in attacking areas (or so it seemed watching at AG).
1323331304134451201 2020-11-03 02:29:03 +0800 <lynas_andrew> In the pub before LD2 starts. Real ales £1.70 a pint to shift it before Thursday.
1323329778435395585 2020-11-03 02:23:00 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @TimPBristol @davidallengreen @britishlivesuk @ukhumanrightsb One is a Dictionary, but The Oxford version of it. Magna Carta Libertatum, is the title of the book by King John/Stephen Langton. So it is the same as not calling Romeo &amp; Juliet by William Shakespeare, The Romeo &amp; Juliet.
1323326528743231493 2020-11-03 02:10:05 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @ThePlastics_SG Election anxiety? It looks like the pain of losing at home to Arsenal seeping through... (Sorry, lifelong LFC supporter).1
1323325923786182662 2020-11-03 02:07:41 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Bellaj0713 Yeap. Ciggies, industrial strength tea, scribble stick &amp; paper, plus time to mull over it. Occasionally swap the tea for a few pints of ale. Jobs a good un.
1323324975542161408 2020-11-03 02:03:55 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Nintendoubt815 Not on my 2020 bingo card...
1323324648554201093 2020-11-03 02:02:37 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @setoacnna @joss_prior Tomorrow they could run a similar story on her, and win that case if she contested it in court. Tit for tat is never a defence.

1323317990742478848 2020-11-03 01:36:09 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @comedy_joey Crikey. I had seven notifications on that tweet from terfs, all now on my block list. I should comment on your tweets more often.
1323299369337180162 2020-11-03 00:22:10 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @calneeagle Tbf, the net didn't move &amp; the linesman was level with the goal, so I can understand why he thought it went wide, the referee had no excuse for missing it.
1323298586252238854 2020-11-03 00:19:03 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @comedy_joey She's found your tweet at Asda about the toilet stickers &amp; has shared it, asking if anyone knows where she can get them from
1323294494176038913 2020-11-03 00:02:47 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @indyfromspace I finish work 16:00 GMT, I shall be cracking open a can of G&amp;T at one minute past, in #solidarity with our cousins across the Atlantic.
1323290834591272967 2020-11-02 23:48:15 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @ThatCorbynista Trump isn't building a barricade around the White House for nothing. He's only leaving if the military escorts him out.
1323279494531174401 2020-11-02 23:03:11 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @calneeagle I was sat behind the goal for the classic Freddie Sears ghost goal 😅😅
1323275864944115712 2020-11-02 22:48:46 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @calneeagle I am seriously missing Ashton Gate.
1323268263254568961 2020-11-02 22:18:33 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @calneeagle Agreed, but it will help somewhat. For me, the only difference is I can't go to the pub after work for a month.
1323260219284164609 2020-11-02 21:46:35 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @calneeagle Of course, but the original graph on the OP wasn't accurate. At the moment, the weekly case rate of 3/4 M by Dec is possible &amp; therefore the high deaths at the end of the month. Hopefully this 2nd lockdown slows the growth rate. Here are 2 graphs showing figures up till yesterday  https://t.co/paDPlurgG9
1323223380603142146 2020-11-02 19:20:12 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SpagFlying Or live in a country with very few guns. A machete attack happens on average every 2 hrs in the UK. It is a weapon frequently used by far right terrorists.
1323217863927320585 2020-11-02 18:58:17 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SpagFlying Terrorists will use whatever weapons they can lay there hands on. It doesn't matter if it's a knife, machete, assault rifle, noose, or bomb. Terrorism is due to extreme ideology, committed by the very few, not the majority.
1323210842968608770 2020-11-02 18:30:23 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @calneeagle @aplynas My surname is Simpson-Lynas
1323210533189881856 2020-11-02 18:29:09 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @calneeagle Read it again from the top.
1323201171176198144 2020-11-02 17:51:57 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SpagFlying Its odd that white Christians no longer get called terrorists, and aren't used to tarnish the rest of Christianity, yet 1.8 billion peaceful followers of Islam are seen as equally guilty as the small number of terrorists that also happen to be Muslim.
1323163563356278784 2020-11-02 15:22:31 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @calneeagle Of course it's not 4%, but people don't die exactly 4 weeks later. 100K new daily cases is just shy of three quarters of a million new weekly cases, and from that figure 4,000 in a day is not unrealistic.
1323064096208621569 2020-11-02 08:47:16 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Completely ignoring that deaths lag 3-4 weeks after infection. Which today alone was over 23,000 new cases. Doubling every 2-3 weeks gives you approx 100,000 daily cases at the start of Dec. 4,000 daily deaths 4 weeks after that is not unrealistic.
1323052477927903241 2020-11-02 08:01:06 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @daveleaper @BootstrapCook My local supermarket cleared them off the shelves by boxing day 😡 otherwise I'd have a couple in the back of the cupboard. It's the only xmassy thing I do, lunch will be a bacon banjo with a case of ale for the long weekend.

1322626242630344704 2020-11-01 03:47:24 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @AP Lols. The only thing that's changed, is I can't go to the pub after work.
1322312916096475138 2020-10-31 07:02:21 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @AlbuQuirky you might like this one.
1322310907066748934 2020-10-31 06:54:22 +0800 <lynas_andrew> One of the weirdest anomalies in life. Baked beans should be a perfectly perfect microwavable food. Yet microwaves cannot cook baked beans properly without a silly amount of human intervention.

1322247295887441920 2020-10-31 02:41:36 +0800 <lynas_andrew> No. Socialist MP's need to go Independent, and then form a new Democratic Socialist party. Being a minority in a neoliberal party  is pointless, they are just supporting the status quo.
1322243352427925505 2020-10-31 02:25:55 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Result. That $300 phone I was thinking of pre-buying, that the manufacturer has said 'wait till launch day &amp; we'll do it for $240' Well they've now also released a $40 discount code for it as well. So now £155. Quietly hoping the US election tips the exchange rate in my favour.
1322240806972018688 2020-10-31 02:15:49 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @sarah_ox_laugh This is the first tweet of yours that Twitter has let me see for three days. I hope they haven't been fascists by hitting you with an undeserved ban just for exercising your free speech.
1322236614442131458 2020-10-31 01:59:09 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @clupidbloropope @HalcyonEmber I have no problems on finger usage, I prefer it set up for right handed people. My issue is I hate only being able to control it left handed, as I can't then scribble notes as I work.
1322234494020161538 2020-10-31 01:50:43 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @malteaser_80 It makes me laugh, Bristol's cases are starting to shoot up, yet being a prosperous southern city, they get tier 1+ instead of tier 2. I live in a fairly affluent rural Conservative area, we could be dropping like flies &amp; we'd stay tier 1.

Then I watched new labour start the destruction of education &amp; the NHS. No more neoliberalism. I want Democratic Socialism as the back of the Labour membership card states.

She was recently taken to court by that Tracy O person, and took it all in her stride with no complaints. Today broke her tether. She is a good rock to latch yourself onto, she often is the voice of calm reason.

It's already 18 years old. 1) why have I never heard of it before. 2) why have I never heard of it before 3) how many games have I binned because they didn't work on XP. 4) why have I never heard of it before.

End of the day, it doesn't matter. Twitter is just a real time journal. Before the t'interweb, most people's only got read after they died.
1321889135498567680 2020-10-30 02:58:24 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SpyderSeven tbf, if anyone sent me shite music, the conversation ends there and then.
1321888711035027460 2020-10-30 02:56:42 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @QVegan So they must be also cancelling Children in Need, as that is an obvious political stance that the government can't support those in need.
1321887627340075013 2020-10-30 02:52:24 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Queue all the centrist labour MP's supporting @lisanandy anti-Semitic comments...
1321883700532027397 2020-10-30 02:36:48 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Centrists need to realise "the brink" is now just a little speck in the rearview mirror. No more pandering to the soft neoliberal right, no more status quo politics. We need a new democratic socialist party.
1321882624793714688 2020-10-30 02:32:31 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @CorbynistaTeen If you get the placement, enjoy Bristol. It's a fantastic city (exiled northerner living here for 20 yrs now).
1321878132794810369 2020-10-30 02:14:40 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @kennardmatt @andrewfeinstein @jeremycorbyn @LauraPidcock Laura has made some transphobic comments that need to be apologised for &amp; learned from. Corbyn was the right choice at the time, not the right choice now. It's time for a new set up. There are plenty socialist MP's that appeal to a broad base that would be better candidates.
1321873105992691714 2020-10-30 01:54:42 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @mcashmanCBE @stonewalluk @BBCNews @APPGLGBT @LizBarkerLords Doesn't the BBC understand that everything is political? What next, charity fundraising? (Comic/sports relief, children in need etc)
1321870597304033280 2020-10-30 01:44:44 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @AaronBastani @BlogRedRobin Don't be daft, remember New Labour? Once the socialists have been put back in their box, the media will big up the Labour party all the way to the next election. The people will think they've had meaningful change, whilst the neoliberal status quo remains unchanged.
1321867874256998401 2020-10-30 01:33:54 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @rustington @Laurencewegner @elliotttimes A neoliberal Labour party is exactly the same thing as the Tory party. It's two sides of the same political coin. If you want change you need something different to vote for, other than a different rosette colour.
1321835495987519489 2020-10-29 23:25:15 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @JayHulmePoet 👋👋
1321833554901434370 2020-10-29 23:17:32 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @JVoiceLabour @alanmaddison20 Sorry, already gone. It's now time to organise a new democratic socialist party &amp; fight from there.
1321832998736637952 2020-10-29 23:15:20 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @MiserableLes1 @0Calamity @johnmcdonnellMP The punt was Corbyn. The only option for the left now, is a new party. I won't vote for neoliberalism, red or blue.
1321829214581071872 2020-10-29 23:00:17 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @MiserableLes1 @0Calamity @johnmcdonnellMP The endgame was under Blair. The left are expected to keep quiet at the back &amp; just vote. The idea of turning a neoliberal party back to a democratic socialist path, is just wishful thinking. Today proves they will never let it happen.
1321564495458848770 2020-10-29 05:28:23 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @AlbuQuirky She's a comedian.

1321206399469342721 2020-10-28 05:45:27 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I've just sneezed 14 times in less than two minutes. Not Covid then, I just have a cold.
1321204664583524353 2020-10-28 05:38:33 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Where is @BellaRizinti when a suit is being worn.
1321203905586487301 2020-10-28 05:35:32 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity here is what we could have had...

1321194968275443713 2020-10-28 05:00:01 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Well at least I've learned a rule of football I never knew before. I hope Scott Brown makes a full &amp; fast recovery. @theyellows
1321181381897134081 2020-10-28 04:06:02 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Sat in a pub in Bristol watching the Liverpool game on the telly, whilst listening to @theyellows through my phone. Hoping for a double win tonight. #ynwa #coyy
1321179250423177216 2020-10-28 03:57:34 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @ShuliElisheva I got 15. A few years ago, a friend who has three children who are autistic/Asperger's said that she thought I was on the spectrum. If I am, I am. I cope &amp; that is all that matters to me.
1321168810267783170 2020-10-28 03:16:05 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Barmaid - what channel is the football on?  Me extremely loudly - BT sports 3.  #YNWA

1321164406181474306 2020-10-28 02:58:35 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @malteaser_80 Only none food ones, surely? Fish &amp; chips with 6 pints please.
1321161298797842433 2020-10-28 02:46:14 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @malteaser_80 How I'm spending mine (sat right in front of a 50 odd inch TV waiting for the Liverpool game to start)  https://t.co/NnrOLAXJse
1321157461202608130 2020-10-28 02:30:59 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @MavenOfMayhem I picked up two 32 ounce passionfruit &amp; pomegranate cheesecakes for 88 English pennies each. So no cooking for me for a couple of days.
1321138278687510537 2020-10-28 01:14:45 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @malteaser_80 If you've got any latex/nitrile gloves, cover you hands in E45 cream &amp; put the gloves on.
1320875130726326274 2020-10-27 07:49:06 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Is anyone else getting totally peeved with @Twitter new insistence that you have to click on a factual source before you can interact with it?  I'd totally understand it for a dodgy 'click bait' site, or a fringe politically biased source, but they seem to be slipping through..
1320868661683462144 2020-10-27 07:23:24 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Ooh, followed by this wonderful song.  https://t.co/o0FKZpa2YL

1320855879755960321 2020-10-27 06:32:36 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Kinysis We've known there was water on the moon for decades, but the last attempt to prove it involved crashing a lander into a creator where we knew the water was. It missed, so it wasn't proved.
1320852170527412224 2020-10-27 06:17:52 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @No7Sammy Once it's safe I'll take you to football.
1320851705525948416 2020-10-27 06:16:01 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I just picked up 2 x 900g raspberry &amp; passion fruit gateau (feeds 12) from tesco, reduced to clear for 88p each. The strange thing is, I've never seen these on sale in Tesco before tonight. Oh well, my gain.
1320834252892741637 2020-10-27 05:06:40 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @JayHulmePoet In the 1970's my mother could only afford to feed me porridge as my evening meal. We are now in 2020, no child should have to live through what I did. Saying parents are deliberately putting themselves first, instead of their children is abhorrent.
1320831519053750272 2020-10-27 04:55:48 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Lol. Twitter made me acknowledge a BBC fact check on this before retweeting.

1320823316282826752 2020-10-27 04:23:12 +0800 <lynas_andrew> How much have you claimed on expenses for food this year?

1320822144192925702 2020-10-27 04:18:33 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @KatyMontgomerie @SoniaPoulton My father adopted me when I was 7 years old. I have no memory of the person who impregnated my mother. Family is who loves you, it doesn't matter who they are, all that matters is that they love you.
1320820301505200128 2020-10-27 04:11:14 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @HalcyonEmber Oooff! That is fantastic. I'm currently dribbling, in a good way (I hope).

1320818861839536128 2020-10-27 04:05:30 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @socalledcharlie @clupidbloropope Fantastic, heal well &amp; be happy.
1320818556829880321 2020-10-27 04:04:18 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Kinysis Well Margot just got a follow from me.
1320818166667370497 2020-10-27 04:02:45 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Kinysis Obviously being a left wing Bernie Bro was the clincher...🤦
1320811320426614784 2020-10-27 03:35:32 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @LeedsTransLad Sorry mate, I don't do the "trying to see something" posts. It's the twitter equivalent of the old Facebook chainmail posts. You know my stance anyway, that's all that matters.
1320810152535183360 2020-10-27 03:30:54 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Newcastle fans raise over £100k for charity... Cnut Ashley goes oh F*CK, I'm not getting that money...
1320806812363403265 2020-10-27 03:17:38 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @JayHulmePoet Yeah, I just bought your scary bone thingy shirt. It might just replace my "I'm literally a communist" shirt as my favourite non football top.
1320802856069435393 2020-10-27 03:01:54 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Got two mentions on #soundofthecity tonight. Happy days.
1320800144728666113 2020-10-27 02:51:08 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @geoff20man, another good interview about the WSL. Last season Liverpool paid an av wage of £20,000 &amp; got relegated. Bristol City will be struggling to pay more than that. The top teams are now paying £150k.
1320796033169936385 2020-10-27 02:34:48 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @GeeMacGee @geoff20man We are running out of options with current injuries, this positional change covers that. Although in Deano we trust.
1320795407383961602 2020-10-27 02:32:18 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Those that like walking, especially around ruins, this is a poll for you.
1320793253801873409 2020-10-27 02:23:45 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @GeeMacGee  Really enjoyed your interview with @geoff20man. I agree with everything you said. Due to injuries, I hope NW drops into midfield replacing AW, and keep AS upfront with FD.
1320789815965736960 2020-10-27 02:10:05 +0800 <lynas_andrew> What the.... I want a one way trip. The 1st sci-fi book I read was "The Moon Is A Hard Mistress" by R A Heinlein.
1320788473096343552 2020-10-27 02:04:45 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @JamesCleverly Idiot.
1320787956911771655 2020-10-27 02:02:42 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @drphiliplee1 Confirming it's wet, or tik tok witches hexing it? I'm old, it's hard to keep up..
1320787436964904965 2020-10-27 02:00:38 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @socalledcharlie As a fellow Alpha Centurian, you get my respect regardless.
1320783405257285632 2020-10-27 01:44:37 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @No7Sammy Doing that predicted text thingy.  Trans people want to go to the pub and restaurant.
1320782322283749378 2020-10-27 01:40:19 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @FreeNorthNow I currently live "down south" but my birth certificate says Lancashire. Can I vote in elections in my hometown, seeing as ex-pats can currently vote from Spain etc?
1320779310307905538 2020-10-27 01:28:21 +0800 <lynas_andrew> The work payroll dept confused the last day of my hols with the last day for those made redundant after furlough. I could have done with a 19 year redundancy payout, and then getting re-employed under a new job title (doing the same job). 😟
1320775998363836421 2020-10-27 01:15:11 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @malteaser_80 Well, there is the mud ones when the tide goes out on the Mersey....
1320681590779973635 2020-10-26 19:00:02 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @KatyMontgomerie Just use plug &amp; socket, if someone doesn't know the difference, they shouldn't be allowed near wiring.
1320647828461490183 2020-10-26 16:45:53 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Fun and games at work. 1st day back in after being on holiday &amp; my computer ID code doesn't work. Phoned IT and they said my employment was terminated on Friday... Nobody knows how or why.

1320148673083441156 2020-10-25 07:42:25 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @comedy_joey @GayestHaunter Damn right you are not. I admit that it was only a few years ago that my stupid brain realised that if there are trans women, then there must also be trans men. I hate how our society has conditioned us to view everyone within such a blinkered spectrum. #Solidarity ✊💜

1320121220420014081 2020-10-25 05:53:20 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @malteaser_80 I'm back Monday. It's been nice to have a week off, just horrid that I couldn't visit home. I'm just hoping this phone auto updates. There is nothing worse than turning up for work an hour early.
1320119196647329792 2020-10-25 05:45:17 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @malteaser_80 Nah.

1320108187157233664 2020-10-25 05:01:32 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @GeeMacGee I look at games lost 1st, then goal difference, then wins. We are currently realistically 4th, not 2nd. If we get to the next break still in the top 4, I'll be happy.
1320106831470002178 2020-10-25 04:56:09 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Did 4 g&amp;t on route to brum. 3 Life &amp; Death on route to briz. 3 g&amp;t listening to the Liverpool game. I'm now hungry, but I've been away for a week, so no food in the house. Off to Tesco's for more g&amp;t then. NO! For food, definitely food, definitely more g&amp;t.
1320103130261000195 2020-10-25 04:41:27 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @mahnkyle That is for bench boost.
1320101381768970246 2020-10-25 04:34:30 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @mahnkyle Rush it? Some people played it in week 1 (bastards). I waited until after an international break, playing at Anfield, against a team we should have easily taken apart.

The other 30m is when the shit hits the fan time, and it has to be paid back. If you are a club facing bankruptcy, surely the owners would just walk away instead of taking on even more secured debt.

1316822381630021632 2020-10-16 03:24:55 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @timpayton @mjshrimper 16 of 20 prem teams are owned by billionaires, compared to 5 of 72 in the EFL. I'm sure your £14.95 per game will do more good than them taking a 0.005% dent in their wealth, which they'd just claim back as a tax loss.

It's how pyramids work. The ones at the top need to realise that if they let those below fail, they also fall.

1316793444241739777 2020-10-16 01:29:56 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @timpayton @mjshrimper 20 mill between 48 teams in grants, that's just over 400k each. That doesn't cover what this pandemic has already cost them, never mind what the future holds. 30 mill held back, which can only be used if a club is about to do a Macclesfield, but has to be paid back. Disgraceful.

It's just that their Sunday best was always black, to show their piety. Their Mon-Sat clothes were much more colourful.

1316502689572945920 2020-10-15 06:14:35 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @RachelT1722 I really can't understand why her constituency hasn't done that petition thing to de-seat her.

1316429992474144768 2020-10-15 01:25:42 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SubtleInternal When the pubs reopened, a friend who I hadn't seen for over 3mths came in &amp; got given a table from where she couldn't see me. I text her "I think I've just fallen in love with your hair". I've never seen someone break social distancing rules so fast. We got told off for hugging.
1316428589970137090 2020-10-15 01:20:08 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Nintendoubt815 I enjoyed seeing your photos. I'm off to the Lakes next week, if the gov don't cave in &amp; put a travel ban in place. It's my only week off work this year.
1316424029977432064 2020-10-15 01:02:01 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SubtleInternal Looks fantastic. Although you have now ruined my Covid guaranteed "putting a smile on a ladies face" greeting for when I see you on Sunday.
1316413485279072258 2020-10-15 00:20:07 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Why is it that when you are out walking and a little doggy runs up to you to sniff your boots, and you stop, bend over and say hello to the little doggy, the owner says hello back? I'M OBVIOUSLY TALKING TO THE DOG!
1316400507674648577 2020-10-14 23:28:33 +0800 <lynas_andrew> No repeat of last night please. I drank 3 cans of 7.5% g&amp;t walking from work to the pub. Drinking 6 pints in the pub. Going to Tesco to buy food. Getting home with £100 of new clothes, more g&amp;t, and no food.  I say to myself as I'm walking from work with a can of g&amp;t in hand.

1315748081644834819 2020-10-13 04:16:02 +0800 <lynas_andrew> So why didn't your "source" give you this information at the time?

1315725806472171522 2020-10-13 02:47:31 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BootstrapCook As much I hate _spoons, it isn't down to him. Lots of pubs in Merseyside are small local boozers (all the ones I like to visit when I go home). If they can do table food service, they can stay open, regardless of whether they are chain owned or independent.

The guys implementing VAR in England make just as many unfathomable decisions as the referees themselves. Arguing about a dodgy ref decision after a game is part of footy culture.

Increasing rights to a minority has never deminished rights for the majority.  When you look after the few, it raises equality for all.

The only thing I know about you is that you are a lesbian, so please don't take this the wrong way if it's something you already knew. The only reason you have your current freedoms is because a trans woman threw a brick.

Do you have a problem with them?

1313928594373177345 2020-10-08 03:46:03 +0800 <lynas_andrew> FFS, just got a scare. The NHS Covid-19 app sent me a notification that I'd been in contact with someone who has tested positive.  I hit the notification, the app opened but there was nothing there.  Googled it, thank feck it's a glitch on the app #FuckSerco
1313921801014194177 2020-10-08 03:19:03 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @sarahmalak2016 Exactly. A sub could pop up 200 miles off coast, the cruise missile would hit 2 mins later. Absolutely no chance to respond.

1313839059110895621 2020-10-07 21:50:16 +0800 <lynas_andrew> The edge of the green circle is 1000 miles from Bristol. Russia have just successfully tested a cruise missile, that if launched from that distance would hit 8 mins &amp; 40 seconds later.  https://t.co/HeORI0FCEu

1313611525001744386 2020-10-07 06:46:07 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @RachelT1722 I'm not up to speed with your owner,  so I can't comment. Wait to see if the new training ground is included as part of the football club, or if it is held as a separate asset. If it's the second one, panic. See Bolton, Wigan etc.
1313609434191605761 2020-10-07 06:37:49 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Ffuzzyface @Polly552 @Michael_AW77 @numquamaeternam @HeavenMarie47 Oh dear, a GC blocked me.
1313608676444377088 2020-10-07 06:34:48 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @haroldthimbleby @equiripple @seecurity @thegrugq At the start of WW1 soldiers had woollen hats and as a result there was a large number of head injuries. So in 1915 soldiers were issued with metal helmets. The number of head injuries skyrocketed.
1313604930775781376 2020-10-07 06:19:55 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @RachelT1722 What's the but? Living outside Swindon, I can only see positives. The better grade of training facilities increases both your attractiveness for youth players to join you, and the catchment area you can get them from. Develop them &amp; sell them for huge profits, as Bristol City do.
1313601523411300353 2020-10-07 06:06:23 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @JordannaG_1 @_Mars_F Oh, that tweet got me an instant block. These GC's are priceless.
1313598297152651265 2020-10-07 05:53:34 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @JordannaG_1 @_Mars_F She just stated that as a trans woman, if she uses a changing room, the contents of her underwear is obviously also going to be in the same changing room. There is no threat in that statement, just fact.

You really need to get a better hobby, or an actual life.
1313586141489172490 2020-10-07 05:05:16 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity We could have no fans at the stadium for over 200 yrs and he would still have millions in his bank account. Love the fact he owns the club, hate the fact Ashton Gate staff got laid off whilst he holds onto his wealth.

Simple maths proves the other. 1% of the population is trans. So 885 trans people should have been in prison in 2017. Only 125 were.
1313549034959798278 2020-10-07 02:37:49 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @giyadas @almay292 @PointlessSpike @litlevox1 @Bronzecats @Kimaris_XX @halford_rosie @notCursedE @helenstaniland Your point was it was men (and by your logic trans women) who are a threat. You have blanket ignored that trans people are less likely to commit crimes, and that women are more likely to commit certain sex crimes. Wake up and see the world for what it really is.

So in the yr of that flawed study you mentioned, there should have been 885 trans prisoners. There were 125. So trans people are 7 times less likely to commit crimes.
1313516443204452358 2020-10-07 00:28:18 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @almay292 @PointlessSpike @litlevox1 @Bronzecats @giyadas @Kimaris_XX @halford_rosie @notCursedE @helenstaniland So 0.07% of the prison population are transgender sex offenders, compared to 18% of the whole prison population.  It isn't transgender people that are a threat, it is sex offenders regardless of the sex/sexuality/gender who are.

They no longer read the S*n, they read the Daily Fail. They wouldn't support Corbyn because the paper tells them not to. They'd support Farage because he is for the people 🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦

Trans people have got so used to others asking about their genitalia, that they've finally gone "fuck it, if you're that interested, I'll ram them down your (figurative) throat" @notCursedE says suck my dick 🤷

This country is full on fascist now, yet very few people realise it. As long as EastEnders is still on the TV, they won't notice the guns turning.

Priti Patel is anti minority. New laws coming in tonight legalising state sponsored violence. They have every reason to be out in the open now. 2020 turning into 1933. Time to be scared.

1313163919054311429 2020-10-06 01:07:30 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @drawnoutofshape Ok. Sidenote, there was a metal fire at the docks near me that had been burning since ten o'clock last night (UK time). The air outside was like breathing welding fumes. A little birb took refuge in the warehouse I work in &amp; sat up near me until the smoke cleared.

Personally I value life over the economy, that always recovers. Yes it will be tough on people, recessions always are.

Keep the virus in check as much as possible until a vaccine is available, or decide our old/disabled/otherwise healthy with existing health conditions can be thrown under a bus. You choose.

They had the highest deaths per million anywhere in Europe. Our population is 7x theirs. How many UK deaths do you think are acceptable?

Allowing vulnerable sections/age groups to die whilst everyone else catches it &amp; survives (with long term health issues not yet known), isn't herd immunity, it's murder through eugenics.

It will rapidly spread to more vulnerable groups. Hospitals won't cope when those groups get ill with this infection growth rate.

Deaths should be a lower percentage this time as we now know how to treat it better than we did in Mar/Apr. Although if cases go silly higher than last time, deaths could also exceed the 1st wave.

At best I get a vague millisecond flash of an image, but I get a whole description of an apple flash in my head, too fast for me to hear that thought process.

It is whether he was justified to slander/libel. He has no proof of his assertions, yet there is ample evidence in his recent life to assert that he is racist.

He admitted his own racism. Now look into his recent actions, inc setting up a far right political party. Join the dots.

So for him to use that reference, in order to make serious and malicious accusations with no basis in truth against someone else, breaches UK law &amp; is not covered by freedom of speech.

When women refuse to do any carrying &amp; put the handbag out of business through choice, then they'll get clothes with decent pockets.

I have to wave frantically when they go to pour the beer I put through, then if I succeed in getting their attention, point left until they reach the correct pump.

1309568242025992195 2020-09-26 02:59:34 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @jimpanzee666 @GeeMacGee I think we already were. I long for the days that we had your pants down over Kodja, but then again you did us with Baker.
1309566479935905794 2020-09-26 02:52:34 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @tfirstelizabeth @GeorgeWOxford @LaurenBolton3 @DiamondPelel @PollyVMarkham It is hilariously funny.
1309559747075547137 2020-09-26 02:25:48 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity Already ordered, obvs I have to own it, if my name's on it.
1309559450492116995 2020-09-26 02:24:38 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @ashtonbcfc @BristolCity It will be worn in a competitive game this season as a thank you to those named on it.
1309558442416377856 2020-09-26 02:20:37 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Mermaids_Gender I do, but only in regard to myself. I'm 48 and only broke my egg last yr. I'd spent my life not knowing why I felt the way I did, but I didn't know the words/concepts to explain it. I'm just the several cubic cm inside my skull, the saggy bag of chemicals I live in, isn't me.
1309551202670202881 2020-09-26 01:51:51 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @LeftieStats @RachelT1722 @SavantaComRes Not a problem, as in they are not aware there is a problem, or that they think being transphobia isn't a problem?
1309549793107161089 2020-09-26 01:46:15 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I was going to do the whole pub avoiding thing again, especially as the NHS app said my area was medium risk??? I checked. They are not allowed to list anywhere as low risk (even when they blatantly are) when the nation is at level 4.  So I'm in the pub, again.
1309541824076410880 2020-09-26 01:14:35 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BcfcBrand @Nintendoubt815 @louie_l20 @BristolCity I think if you didn't choose between the two options, your money automatically went to the youth set up.
1309537947281231874 2020-09-26 00:59:11 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @bristolcitylive @GeeMacGee It's another classic from @hummel1923  I've just blown another £50.
1309537548134424579 2020-09-26 00:57:36 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Nintendoubt815 @BcfcBrand @louie_l20 @BristolCity Everyone got the free stream unless you specifically asked for a full refund. You then had the choice to donate your money to the youth set up, or to let the club keep it &amp; get your name on this shirt.
1309536448065003521 2020-09-26 00:53:13 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity @hummel1923 @jmp_uk Just ordered one. I normally get a new shirt every 3-4 years, I've bought 3 this summer. Nice one Hummel, I'm gonna be skint for xmas this year.
1309534538469642241 2020-09-26 00:45:38 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @louie_l20 @BristolCity A thank you to the fans that let the club keep the money that season ticket holders had paid for the missed games due to Covid-19.
1309533938264813578 2020-09-26 00:43:15 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Lloyd_Robson7 @BristolCity We got the option last season for a refund, donate the money to the youth set up, or let the club keep it &amp; get your name on this shirt.
1309533076574396419 2020-09-26 00:39:50 +0800 <lynas_andrew> OMG! You know I've got to buy it. My name is on there somewhere.
1309523912213098546 2020-09-26 00:03:25 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Nintendoubt815 @SubtleInternal Yeah I knew that, the photo was for Subtle internal.
1309474528096129030 2020-09-25 20:47:11 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SubtleInternal @Nintendoubt815 It's just arrived.  https://t.co/9KEtU7S6Ce
1309440867074224128 2020-09-25 18:33:25 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SubtleInternal @Nintendoubt815 I think the away shirt is better as the black block work is replaced with a thin black outline, I'll stick up a photo when it arrives.
1309439458597629955 2020-09-25 18:27:49 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @stavvers And we can reduce that debt to under £1.3 trillion simply by burning £738 billion. I love how national debt works.
1309427961758732290 2020-09-25 17:42:08 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Nintendoubt815 They sent out texts yesterday to tell us they were being delivered today, and the courier text this morning with the delivery time. Mine's due between 13:30 &amp; 14:30.
1309246887707410432 2020-09-25 05:42:37 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Gonna have to mute my phone. Between the ingredients of an egg, Aston villa fans, and Americans with no sense of timescales, my notifications are going mental, and I need to sleep. See you all in the morning. Hugs.
1309242910362267649 2020-09-25 05:26:49 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @jimpanzee666 @GeeMacGee Maybe if you had played Grealish, we might have had a chance.
1309241132757528576 2020-09-25 05:19:45 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @KieranMaguire I feel for the clubs that don't own their stadium. Ashton Gate has held drive-in movie nights &amp; comedy nights. It isn't a massive income, but it helps.
1309234681917984770 2020-09-25 04:54:07 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Connor__AVFC @tom_price_avfc @GeeMacGee Whatever  https://t.co/t1OEYjh166

1309230671387295744 2020-09-25 04:38:11 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @tom_price_avfc @GeeMacGee I might be old, but I'm not stupid. A meme should have some relevance, like this one..  https://t.co/LckA1F76KF
1309229748065894400 2020-09-25 04:34:30 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @tom_price_avfc @GeeMacGee Oh, I just wondered because he's totally unrelated to the game tonight.
1309225259921543190 2020-09-25 04:16:40 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @tom_price_avfc @GeeMacGee Is he your new boss now?
1309225112500146185 2020-09-25 04:16:05 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @AVFCOlly_ @GeeMacGee Cheers mate. I take it I won the sweepstake, even though he didn't make the squad??
1309224512735584259 2020-09-25 04:13:42 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @L1PMNReece @GeeMacGee Thank you.
1309224190411771923 2020-09-25 04:12:25 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @CarolineJanes6 @BernieSanders Sorry, I made an assumption due to you arguing for the centre of the universe US viewpoint. Please accept my apologies.
1309220149090758661 2020-09-25 03:56:22 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @CarolineJanes6 @BernieSanders No that's the 19th century, when my great grandparents were born. It's not that long ago. Okay, your country might still have been in diapers, but hey all of modern history just revolves around the US of A. Screw the rest of the world.
1309219411799281666 2020-09-25 03:53:26 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @CarolineJanes6 @BernieSanders Modern times does not equal today, just like a sport only played on your continent is not a world series.
1309219012572839936 2020-09-25 03:51:51 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I'm currently looking at these wonderous peeps, unfortunately phone cameras are rubbish at night shots 😩  https://t.co/U4bMjYra2f
1309211380055244801 2020-09-25 03:21:31 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @CarolineJanes6 @BernieSanders Water pollution was a major problem then. Ever heard of Typhoid?
1309210967859957760 2020-09-25 03:19:53 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @CarolineJanes6 @BernieSanders The United States is not the sum of the modern world. There are another 200+ countries in the world. Your 250 year-ish history doesn't define modern, and it certainly doesn't erase the histories of democracies such as Iceland.
1309201640801656833 2020-09-25 02:42:49 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SpaceUnitedFC @lowerleagueEcup @mplscitysc @falconsoccer I'm also transgender.
1309201343568138240 2020-09-25 02:41:38 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @CarolineJanes6 @BernieSanders No, your point was that if you excluded the entirety of human history, then Bernie is correct. He isn't because Iceland's continuous run only ended in 1800, which is still in modern times.
1309200390949425152 2020-09-25 02:37:51 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @lowerleagueEcup @mplscitysc @SpaceUnitedFC Gutted that @falconsoccer got knocked out. I shall avenge them by voting for @mplscitysc
1309199412523130880 2020-09-25 02:33:58 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @CarolineJanes6 @BernieSanders You do realise that the United States is one of the youngest countries in the world. I've drank in pubs that are twice as old as the "good ol' united states'. When they actually have some history, then come back with your bad takes.
1309197805542617095 2020-09-25 02:27:35 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @jensbib @BernieSanders It still ran it's own parliament all the way through that time (brief pause between 1800-1844). Still the oldest democracy &amp; most continuous 900-1800.
1309196835874050055 2020-09-25 02:23:44 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @LadyYan0789 @BernieSanders Suffrage has nothing to do with democracy, that is an equality issue. See my other thread on this.
1309187590638252033 2020-09-25 01:46:59 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @TheGAndP @MSmoorenburg @BernieSanders Stating that a democracy can exist without equality is not lying. There is not one country on the planet where all it's citizens are equal. If you think that there is, you are deluded. #TransRightsAreHumanRights  #BlackLivesMatter
1309186494251380737 2020-09-25 01:42:38 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @AliumBritt @MineralCup I can multitask.
1309186255792549889 2020-09-25 01:41:41 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @geologyjess @MineralCup NEVER diss the Sapphire.  https://t.co/wKXzvvIRdJ
1309185680883552258 2020-09-25 01:39:24 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @TheGAndP @MSmoorenburg @BernieSanders That is equality. A dictatorship can have full equality, yet isn't democratic.
1309185195577421824 2020-09-25 01:37:28 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @DoughnutWall @BernieSanders That is still modern in the history of human civilization. There are pubs in England older than the United States.
1309184611549949952 2020-09-25 01:35:09 +0800 <lynas_andrew> OMG I've just stumbled upon the K-pop stans obliterating twitter today. This old fart has absolute respect for them. #longlivetherevolution
1309183736769056769 2020-09-25 01:31:40 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @TheGAndP @MSmoorenburg @BernieSanders That has nothing to do with parliament or democracy though. Iceland was 900AD, England was in the 13th century.
1309181758940811264 2020-09-25 01:23:49 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @JedvanEuropa @BernieSanders Being nominated by the council is not the same as being voted for by the populace (Google Iceland instead).
1309181180680564737 2020-09-25 01:21:31 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @MSmoorenburg @BernieSanders No Iceland is (UK citizen).
1309180971187666946 2020-09-25 01:20:41 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BernieSanders No. Iceland is. Oldest democracy and ran continuously from 930 to 1800. When the USA has been going for over 870 years, then you can claim that title. p.s you won't, you will be a dictatorship by new year.
1309178211079782400 2020-09-25 01:09:43 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @TheExiledRobin Yeah, but he wasn't wearing this horrid shirt (I have the away version being delivered tomorrow 😍)
1309176842113474561 2020-09-25 01:04:17 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity No Messi??
1309169115718914048 2020-09-25 00:33:35 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @frosty920 @GeeMacGee As a City STH (but not Bristolian) I have no problems with you guys loaning our youth players. Football experience is football experience, regardless of the team, and as your local it is easier for them to pop back to Failand as and when required.
1309167917846724612 2020-09-25 00:28:49 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SakuraNoSeirei  https://t.co/5hJpVwhG4d

1309166539480993793 2020-09-25 00:23:20 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Having read the t&amp;c's of the NHS Covid-19 app, I'm happy to use it. If you haven't downloaded it yet please do so (obvs dependant on if your phone supports it).
1309165553697857541 2020-09-25 00:19:25 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @a_leesha1 If we all vote Green (the closest party England has to a socialist party) in the next local elections, maybe just maybe Labour might wake up a little bit, but I won't hold my breath.
1309164656817246211 2020-09-25 00:15:51 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @GeeMacGee Sweepstake on in which minute Grealish does his first 10 roll "ref I've been shot" move? I'm going for the 12th.

1309120483682590720 2020-09-24 21:20:20 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @malteaser_80 Cheaper to make 2/3 of the workforce redundant.

1309003938889428992 2020-09-24 13:37:13 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Set a new record at work. Today's temperature 32.4 C (90.3 F)
1308898396367925249 2020-09-24 06:37:50 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @TomLondon6 @BlogRedRobin @TwitterSupport They are still there. It's just displaying the wrong number. They've had a glitch today which has affected a lot of accounts.
1308896041689899009 2020-09-24 06:28:29 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Nintendoubt815 @alexiswinchster Yeah but Bristol colony 9 doesn't exist. Apparently they only realised when they spotted that a lot of people used the location tag to put their pronouns in.
1308894937430323200 2020-09-24 06:24:05 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @alexiswinchster @Nintendoubt815 They did a bot sweep that went wrong. Anyone with a fake location (you have colony 9) got caught up in it. They've reset it now, so you should be back to normal.
1308891229946556416 2020-09-24 06:09:21 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @CaseyExplosion I've seen that it was a bot purge that went too far. Accounts that have false locations in their bio got caught up in it.
1308890524842164224 2020-09-24 06:06:33 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @kosmos_uzuki @theymerSophie In that case I'm changing mine to a fake location.
1308888352930910211 2020-09-24 05:57:55 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @KatyMontgomerie T'interweb hugs my dear. Take a break, recharge your batteries. A walk in the woods always puts my head back into focus (also I don't have a cute cat to chill out with).
1308886632733564928 2020-09-24 05:51:05 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @UKLabour 18 votes against is not fighting. You just blatantly condoned it.
1308885102169128960 2020-09-24 05:45:00 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @No7Sammy @jack_murley Yes. I really enjoyed listening to your chat on there.
1308883706606739458 2020-09-24 05:39:28 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Brownhill10 @BurnleyOfficial I had you down for being on the bench for this weekends Fantasy Football fixtures, now I'm tempted to play you and bench Vardy instead.
1308881576932061186 2020-09-24 05:31:00 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BalancePowerUK @DrRosena ???
1308878428519661570 2020-09-24 05:18:29 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @fayekinley2 So my take on this is that if I don't eat eggs, I can smoke 20 a day.
1308860343968567296 2020-09-24 04:06:38 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Transsomething Yeap, and Whitby has street parking permits, so you can't be cheeky and stick your car in a side street.
1308856361116196870 2020-09-24 03:50:48 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @OSIBpodcast @GeeMacGee I'm now considering putting Vardy on the bench (playing Man City) and using Brownhill instead in a midfield 5.
1308834628007071746 2020-09-24 02:24:26 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Re above. I spent most of today with cold feet. They now feel okay only because my hands have gone numb (don't worry, I've put up with this since I had rheumatic fever 40yrs ago). Yet I wonder if tomorrow morning I can beat today's temperature of 34.1C (93.4F) 🥶🥶
1308821744233447427 2020-09-24 01:33:15 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Nintendoubt815 @EFL I heard that Hull refused Covid testing before playing West Ham last night due to the cost. West Ham offered to pay for them &amp; Hull still refused.
1308808832458555395 2020-09-24 00:41:56 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @falconsoccer I've just been to your site to order one, but it looks like you don't ship to the UK. Is there anyway to arrange shipment over here?
1308805257057763331 2020-09-24 00:27:44 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Biggreenbooks @eyeofjordan Thank you Jordan.
1308801493009674240 2020-09-24 00:12:46 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @eyeofjordan @Biggreenbooks If the offer hasn't gone, may I take it. I've read 1984 over 20 times, but I haven't read Brave New World.
1308726195425603586 2020-09-23 19:13:34 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SophieSkyeHigh @notCursedE I don't...
1308656104121995266 2020-09-23 14:35:03 +0800 <lynas_andrew> As well as mandatory facemasks, we also are having our temperatures taken before we start work. I have hypothermia...
1308512496844668929 2020-09-23 05:04:24 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @taylorswiftly93 And you had to share it when I'm completely out of brain bleach.
1308507107927482369 2020-09-23 04:43:00 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity @GeeMacGee Cheers Gaffer.
1308477761334513664 2020-09-23 02:46:23 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Chr1stinaG Block her? Apparently that Fox bloke thinks unfollowing is a cancel, so a block must definitely be a cancel.
1308459472541700096 2020-09-23 01:33:42 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Cheers Johnson, my boss has got in touch. As of tomorrow I have to wear a facemask at all times in work. Nine &amp; a half hrs wearing a mask.  I have my own work area.   THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SQUARE METRES ALL TO MYSELF.  Just who am I going to catch the virus from????
1308452749827280897 2020-09-23 01:07:00 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @rfnapps @_DHOTYA They also sold a poppy hijab to commemorate the 1 million plus Muslims that died fighting for us in WW1.
1308450833495977985 2020-09-23 00:59:23 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Oh ffs, it gets earlier every year. Okay if their are any bigoted gammons following me that I haven't spotted &amp; blocked. NO THE BRITISH LEGION IS NOT BEING STOPPED FROM SELLING POPPIES IN ETHNIC MINORITY COMMUNITIES. ffs! read this..  https://t.co/t81tUWi4NU

1308341916719775746 2020-09-22 17:46:35 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SubtleInternal Wait till they get the new only one sorted, it's apparently going to be simpler &amp; a lot cheaper.
1308339442529296390 2020-09-22 17:36:45 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @DinoCrisisJr @KatyMontgomerie @Mermaids_Gender @GEOgovuk It's Tory ideology to cut services &amp; reduce expenditure. So when they actually increase a service, even if it's a small amount, take it as a win.
1308334494752165888 2020-09-22 17:17:05 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @KatyMontgomerie Acknowledgement of poor trans healthcare so, 3 new GIC clinics. GRC too complicated, so going online &amp; nominal fees, etc.
1308333382468804609 2020-09-22 17:12:40 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @KatyMontgomerie No, seriously read it.
1308332587002335233 2020-09-22 17:09:31 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @KatyMontgomerie The terfs are going to go batshit.
1308332397293965314 2020-09-22 17:08:45 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @KatyMontgomerie @Mermaids_Gender @GEOgovuk It's very good.
1308189877155123206 2020-09-22 07:42:26 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Kwg23Goff @CateSpice That definitely looks more edible...👏👏👏
1308186315528302594 2020-09-22 07:28:17 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @GeeMacGee I saw that Bakinson dropped performance points because he didn't complete any tackles. Virgil Van Dijk has lost me bets because he made no tackles in a game. Good defenders don't need to tackle.
1308160009348550663 2020-09-22 05:43:45 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @ElectricClair It's not the same?
1308157567303065600 2020-09-22 05:34:03 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @mattzarb @OwenJones84 I haven't eaten those since visiting my estranged grandparents in the 1970's. I'm now feeling nostalgic. I shall hunt them down. They'd better taste like modern socialism, because my memory of the '70s is only slightly better than New Labour.
1308153759843921920 2020-09-22 05:18:55 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @MichelleOwen7 @ollie_olly_olly I'm old enough to have played the 1st version of Sensible Soccer. Andy Townsend was an integral part of your squad...
1308152157863059461 2020-09-22 05:12:33 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @taylorswiftly93 I don't have pronouns in mine, because they are only words. It doesn't matter what words you use towards me, what matters is the context you use them in. Polite = happy days 😍 Impolite= YOU WILL BE HUNTED DOWN UNTIL I KILL YOU.
1308144210751754242 2020-09-22 04:40:58 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I know when a friend is in a mental health bad way They continually slag off a mutual for the state of mind that they had several years ago What can you do? I tried explaining that that was then, not now I tell them about my own mental health issues. They still don't comprehend.
1308139778609688576 2020-09-22 04:23:21 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Come on KDB, I made you Captain this week. You need another goal/assist tonight. If you let me down, you get demoted behind Bamford.
1308134378040688653 2020-09-22 04:01:54 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity That's still not  photos of Eliason or Diedhiou with pens in hand...
1308133922660921344 2020-09-22 04:00:05 +0800 <lynas_andrew> tbf, I get this. If terfs are stuck in 1970's mentally then why should we argue against using 2020 logic? Let's jump all over their playground.
1308132369229062150 2020-09-22 03:53:55 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @PJWillx We are lucky that there has been next to no infections in Bradley Stoke, yet the pubs &amp; the vast majority of people are still taking the pandemic seriously. It's a shame that harder hit areas are treating it as a hoax/hardship.
1308124948968415233 2020-09-22 03:24:26 +0800 <lynas_andrew> A 92yr old man who lives alone decided he'd been in lockdown too long, and wanted to come into the pub so that he could be near other people. The bar staff asked if I'd be happy for him to sit with me, I said yes. We've now sat together 3 times &amp; I've learned so much from him🗣️👂
1308088148040220674 2020-09-22 00:58:12 +0800 <lynas_andrew> So those that say, cases may be rising, but hospital admissions aren't. Hospital admissions might still be low, but look at the increase of those that need to be intubated.
1308087174873706498 2020-09-22 00:54:20 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SpyderSeven Being comfortable with someone close to me in public is something I find easy. Being me in public is something I find incredibly difficult.
1308084759453741069 2020-09-22 00:44:44 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Come on #transtwitter you gotta back the Falcons in this one (also vote in the other semifinal to keep things fairish)
1308083494459932674 2020-09-22 00:39:42 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @badideasgirl They appear to be on a mission to collect blocks, so I've just given them another one to add to their collection.
1308050997177192449 2020-09-21 22:30:34 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @HalcyonEmber Medium UV levels between Feb &amp; Oct will make my arms itch as if I've rolled in nettles, if I'm out in sunlight for more than 20 mins.
1308047866540236801 2020-09-21 22:18:08 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @HalcyonEmber I'm allergic to UV, but every now &amp; again I just go fuck it, and go out in it without covering up or using SP50.
1308030607759495168 2020-09-21 21:09:33 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @TheSportsman @SportsPeteO 2 goals each, and provide each other with the assists. Sorted.
1308020281009635328 2020-09-21 20:28:31 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @TheSportsman @SportsPeteO Don't jinx it. I need KDB to have a storming game tonight to save my FF team..
1307998110879232002 2020-09-21 19:00:25 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @lambeeladaki @KatyMontgomerie I've just checked the voting records of those eleven. Six have previously voted in favour on LGBTQ equality. One against, the other four haven't had the opportunity to vote on equality issues yet.
1307983550172536834 2020-09-21 18:02:34 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @taylorswiftly93 @cumPlayWithIzzy New account with Hitler in their name &amp; proclaiming to be the New Messiah.. Definitely getting a block from me.
1307937103259537409 2020-09-21 14:58:00 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @thegoodgodabove My scientific head says no.  The ghost that lives in my local pub, means I have to disagree with myself.

1306733380868935689 2020-09-18 07:14:50 +0800 <lynas_andrew> When you only have microwave meals in the house, and your microwave goes bang. Luckily big Tesco is only a 20 min walk away, carrying a new microwave back again takes a hell of a lot longer. RIP my plan for an early night.
1306695316188602368 2020-09-18 04:43:35 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @JackieMayes5 @SteveParker1971 @stockport1965 @gabyhinsliff You clearly don't understand exponential growth. This was Warrington in May when the contagion rate was a lot lower than now.  https://t.co/cx1REZlAkS
1306691148287815680 2020-09-18 04:27:01 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SteveParker1971 @stockport1965 @JackieMayes5 @gabyhinsliff Warrington which had a low infection rate 3 weeks ago, have just this week had a 500% increase in hospitalisations, so yeah keep pretending it's just colds.
1306679528283045893 2020-09-18 03:40:51 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Absolute solidarity. A New York taxi license can cost over $1M.  Imagine taking out a loan that size just to do your job. Then Uber come along with no license costs...
1306676775506841601 2020-09-18 03:29:54 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity @kaseypalmer45 Sorry, but that entire team were winners.
1306671436518563840 2020-09-18 03:08:41 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @gabyhinsliff Children don't spread the disease, 800+ schools with Covid cases later...
1306668480373108742 2020-09-18 02:56:57 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @closeted_egg_56 @transscribe She said she was intersex and thought transgender people were freaks...
1306666980930457605 2020-09-18 02:50:59 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @DerbyGhostE @TGNProfessor @transscribe The media loved her until they worked out she couldn't give birth, then they dismissed her. That teaches you everything you ever need to know about our societal norms.
1306665879850176513 2020-09-18 02:46:37 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @pinkladyfoxx @badideasgirl The access, and the internet are two separate things. We basically use phone companies etc to access the internet. The internet is free, but we have to pay to use the infrastructure.
1306656416007180294 2020-09-18 02:09:00 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @KatyMontgomerie I wonder if how they get their heads around artificial gametes.
1306649253750730753 2020-09-18 01:40:33 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @AnneKennedy61 @whippetfairy The most painful thing is that all those Tories that worked under Thatcher, those that I have despised for so long, are the Tories that I'm now having to agree with, as they are the only ones with the backbone to stand up to Johnson.
1306641854033788931 2020-09-18 01:11:08 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Cinnabar isn't far enough ahead for me to be comfortable that it will win. It gives us Vermilion ffs. Calling all @slipknot  fans to vote &amp; retweet. #vermillion #slipknot

1306335632311148546 2020-09-17 04:54:19 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Massive shout out to @tinnion_brian for using the word wazzed in the commentary. I haven't heard anyone say that for over 25 years 👏👏👏
1306333879117246464 2020-09-17 04:47:21 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity Best £10 I've ever spent. Fantastic performance against a team that humbled Cardiff, and tore Exeter apart, whom we struggled to beat.
1306332995117355020 2020-09-17 04:43:51 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @GeeMacGee  If you rate any @BristolCity player less than 8/10 (other than Kalas) tonight, then you need to visit Specsavers. @kaseypalmer45 on fire, MOTM for me. Nagy didn't look involved, but by god he did that unassuming midfield role well, with some absolutely sublime touches
1306295789321363456 2020-09-17 02:16:00 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity This team just made me spend a tenner. #COYR
1306294456916807681 2020-09-17 02:10:42 +0800 <lynas_andrew> OMG! This will mean nothing to non @BristolCity fans, but it that is our b team (with 2 a team player's), OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG This team will make limbs, even if it's just in our own living rooms.
1306291079571034112 2020-09-17 01:57:17 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @lea1973nne @notCursedE These days you need a floppy drive on a PC. It's the only way to kill win8/win 10. Dos boot disk, wipe harddrive, install 95/millennium/xp/vista then upgrade from that if you need to.
1306289760470732805 2020-09-17 01:52:03 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @lea1973nne @notCursedE Mine was only that expensive because they'd just introduced a CD drive, and win95 came on one disc. My mother bought win95 the year before &amp; it was on approx 30 floppy disks.
1306286416549339138 2020-09-17 01:38:45 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @lea1973nne @notCursedE £2000 for a win95 with 1GB hard drive 😱. Built my own 4yrs later for £600.
1306286016546963456 2020-09-17 01:37:10 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @K8TBenoit @notCursedE Lols, I was about 30ish when they came out.
1306285721846796289 2020-09-17 01:36:00 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @notCursedE Mine was the same, but if you chose the right compression, you could get over 50 songs on it.
1306284337227325440 2020-09-17 01:30:30 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Absolute classic song being completely mutilated. You will love it. #LFC #YNWA  https://t.co/thbFge6RmE
1306281355798609923 2020-09-17 01:18:39 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Just remembered I haven't been to a gig since Halestorm last November. My next gig is Black Stone Cherry, which should have been in 4 weeks time. It's now 12 mths away. That thought was depressing, then @o2academybris email me. Tickets for gigs in 13 mths time. Top trolling 😢😫
1306279693579149314 2020-09-17 01:12:03 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @malteaser_80 I hate paying by card as I never know what's in my bank account. I'd rather wait till all my direct debits have gone out, then put what's left in my wallet. The "oh fuck, that's all I have till the end of the month" moment is a great way to force you to budget.
1306275261512667136 2020-09-17 00:54:26 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I took £40 out of an ATM at the start of April. It's still in my wallet. I'm starting to think physical cash will be abolished before I get chance to spend it.

1306000524031004678 2020-09-16 06:42:43 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @malteaser_80 Just get it right for long enough.
1306000141149712384 2020-09-16 06:41:12 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I'm starting to think @Twitter algorithms are getting as bad as Facebook's were before I deleted my account with them.
1305995010287042562 2020-09-16 06:20:49 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @malteaser_80 Don't worry about it. life wouldn't be a learning curve if you got it right ever.
1305973042271653888 2020-09-16 04:53:31 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Kinysis I did all those things, except emo didn't exist when I was a teen-ager. Love your life my dear, live it &amp; love it. You may evolve, but don't worry if you don't.
1305962261505290242 2020-09-16 04:10:41 +0800 <lynas_andrew> If twitter translate is working properly, and I've understood those translations correctly, then today a fellow human being has found a place of safety.  Good luck in your new life 💜
1305934772104036354 2020-09-16 02:21:27 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Retaj95863116 I got the translation this time. I hope you find somewhere safe. Solidarity.
1305930400150192128 2020-09-16 02:04:05 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I've bought a new rucksack, but I haven't started using it yet because I'm still emotionally attached to 'Old Faithful'. This is the current condition of the bottom of 'Old Faithful'. For a 25yr old rucksack I'm impressed (it's just starting to fall apart in other areas 😭)  https://t.co/Vqg2BAPuxM
1305920617875636226 2020-09-16 01:25:12 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Just remembered I got my dates wrong (well it was 15yrs ago). Today is when I arrived in Halifax, it was the 18th I went to Grand Falls.
1305919827530461184 2020-09-16 01:22:04 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Ciggy in one hand, can of Bombay Sapphire in the other. Gently strolling through the nature reserve, and boom! One by Metallica hits my eardrums.  Can life get better than that?
1305906135933882370 2020-09-16 00:27:40 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @ElectricClair Poptarts should go inside a sandwich.  Discuss.
1305814861180538880 2020-09-15 18:24:58 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Just remembered that 15 yrs ago today I was travelling by bus from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Grand Falls, New Brunswick.
1305618761928540161 2020-09-15 05:25:44 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @aribrown913 I have a friend like that. I won't tag her, she will see this in her feed next time she logs in.
1305609321225621507 2020-09-15 04:48:13 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Retaj95863116 Twitter isn't translating your words. I wish you all the best on your journey.
1305604937498361861 2020-09-15 04:30:48 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @astro_jje Edgar Rice Burroughs was a lot earlier. I think Robert A Heinlein was also earlier, but I'm not 100% on him.
1305602862953758721 2020-09-15 04:22:34 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Henriettaspoon Twitter have tied it into any mention of jkr. So it's trending more every time she's mentioned  https://t.co/eE4VUpdGhu
1305601997664649218 2020-09-15 04:19:07 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @DreyfusJames Although if you look at the trending list, it is tied to JKRowling, so everyone someone does IStandWith JKRowling, it includes the RIP hashtag. You need to be more critical in assigning your hate.
1305599458466574339 2020-09-15 04:09:02 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @astro_jje Fair enough, so did I. The embargo broke properly 2hrs before hand. Even SETI broke it 😄😄.
1305598532598996992 2020-09-15 04:05:21 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @astro_jje What? You should have heard the Venus news before yesterday. I'm a lay person and I knew. Something seriously wrong when science twitter's "secret gossip" doesn't reach people working in the field. Re JKTerfing, yeah she's a ****.
1305597253965545473 2020-09-15 04:00:16 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I got the opportunity to read the overview yesterday, and now I have the full study, thank god because it's a massive piece of work. Make a massive amount of tea/coffee and enjoy.  https://t.co/ew3VmZ9Yi0
1305586096433176577 2020-09-15 03:15:56 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @malteaser_80 And also the one place it would be inappropriate for me to imagine offering you t'interweb hugs. So I'll save them till tomorrow.
1305585055310524417 2020-09-15 03:11:48 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity Oct 14th 2006. My marriage had just ended. I was a mess. A friend knew I used to follow Crewe Alex and they were at The Gate. He took me along, and as we sat in the Atyeo he announced extremely loudly "he's a Crewe fan". Been down The Gate ever since.

1305581053650841600 2020-09-15 02:55:54 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @drphiliplee1 I helped crowdfund a book a while back. They explained the time scales from writing to it being published. JKTerfings first outburst ties into a books "sat at the publishers" phase. This is a massive marketing campaign for her. We all gave her free exposure. No more.

I suffered life long depression, suicidal on many occasions, was an introvert, because I couldn't understand why I was different to the men I was supposed to be like. It took me 47 yrs. Please let her be her.

1305493561694183425 2020-09-14 21:08:14 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Yes, they are lying, but linking an article from May without disclosing that, is also close to lies.

A newspaper reporter sat outside one in London, no slots available online, only a handful of people turned up whilst they watched it. Two had turned up on the off chance, they got tested.

They found 2 strains. 70% of patients had strain l, 30% strain s. l was a mutation of s, they don't know how long  strain s was in circulation before mutating into the more virulent strain l.

IRL I'll stand our corner, because opting out of real life isn't an option. Online is fictional (wrong word) interactions, it's optional like turning on the TV, or choosing which genre of book to read.
1305160803826438147 2020-09-13 23:05:59 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @No7Sammy On the street, you either make a connection or you get punched. Most people are more tolerant face to face, even if they decide to agree to disagree, they remember next time they see you. It's easier online to throw as much hate &amp; vitriol as they like &amp; repeat doing so.

I'll engage, but if it's obvious they are a bigot, I'll block. There are some willing to be open, 99% aren't. In real life, I'll confront it &amp; not walk away. On this hellsite, not worth it.
1305154401779281931 2020-09-13 22:40:32 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Bryant1chris @timshires @Davefevs I thought it was the £300k transfer fee, was more than the entire Bristol City budget for the season.

The only reason I can think xmas is being pushed early, is companies are suffering for profits/cash flow at the mo. They want us to start spending early &amp; hope we carry on. Tough, I'll by my 1st xmas pud on xmas eve when they're half price.
1305152123240361984 2020-09-13 22:31:29 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @No7Sammy I think that is only true in one direction. A tolerant person standing against intolerance, isn't being intolerant to the intolerant. I'll happily block bigots. Excluding them &amp; only interacting with people who are nice, isn't an echo chamber, it's bliss.

1304478390892802049 2020-09-12 01:54:19 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Just did a Google, I don't need to use a torque wrench. 80 ft lb is equivalent to 1 large carrot, so I'll take one of those into work on Monday. Fuck knows how it will torque a bolt for me.
1304467141501083657 2020-09-12 01:09:37 +0800 <lynas_andrew> US calories are the same as UK Imperial ones (because their ounces &amp; pints aren't). Now joules to Newton metres.. Praise the lord, the joys of the SI system, energy used &amp; circular force &amp; every other damned unit of whatever, all tally up. My torque wrench doesn't go that high 🤬
1304467140062445575 2020-09-12 01:09:36 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Lots, and I mean lots more swearing at America. This bolt needs to be 80 ft lb. My torque wrench is in Nm. So Google time.  OMG, ft lb is defined as the energy used to move 1lb 1ft, so it converts to calories. Fanfuckingtastic. Calories to joules conversion time, hoping that

We have our own criteria on how we decide to vote on this "annual fun poll". If Google doesn't come up with a Slipknot reference &amp; all other references are woo woo. I vote against.

1303802489448390663 2020-09-10 05:08:31 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I know that face, I really know that face, I don't recognise that face, but I effin know it. Stares a little bit too long, they notice, wave, smile, run up and give ne a non distancing hug. 15yrs of being a redhead, and they chose this year to go blonde.

1303791105964679179 2020-09-10 04:23:17 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @No7Sammy No worries, at least your take away from this isn't you being confused about whether or not I am racist, because it seems i was odds on at one point 😨. Side note, we have the footy game lined up, it might be an idea to actually meet each other before spending 2hrs together?
1303786522316070912 2020-09-10 04:05:04 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @chaoswolf1982 @BellaRizinti @OccultTherapist The WWE was called the WWF &amp; tried suing the WWF charity for copyright infringement even though the charity is eon's old. They lost &amp; were forced to change their name.
1303784982037528577 2020-09-10 03:58:57 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @CateSpice @KatyMontgomerie She hates slimy food anyway, so...
1303784330020483072 2020-09-10 03:56:22 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @No7Sammy Other way around. I bet on Bristol City enough. 2/1 I double my money &amp; get my stake back. 1/4 must be Liverpool playing Man Utd.
1303783635435368448 2020-09-10 03:53:36 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @chaoswolf1982 @BellaRizinti @OccultTherapist The World Wide Eund has a redheaded panda that's related to a North African that introduced fine pottery &amp; copper working to the UK? Wow, what a small world.
1303782170406858754 2020-09-10 03:47:47 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @No7Sammy So I bet £1 and you pay me half a million?
1303781676690976768 2020-09-10 03:45:49 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity Just remembered he's one of ours? That bodes well for his future progression.
1303780213864660992 2020-09-10 03:40:00 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity @kaseypalmer45 He's got his mojo back  https://t.co/7Bokcu1B2L
1303779446479032321 2020-09-10 03:36:57 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BellaRizinti @OccultTherapist I thought the Celts got their redhair due to the British Isles being invaded by Beaker.  https://t.co/99iBmDNuFw
1303777499915186176 2020-09-10 03:29:13 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @No7Sammy I'm offering odds of 1/500,000.
1303776854055235585 2020-09-10 03:26:39 +0800 <lynas_andrew> The second most archaic British institution that most sensible people want abolishing, may in fact be the best mechanism that stops our country turning into a dictatorship.

1303772251569958912 2020-09-10 03:08:22 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @No7Sammy Nope. I just want to see the best human athletes compete regardless of how they were born. Regarding Caster Semenya (OMG autocorrect just changed that to dementia 😱) would she have had to run this gauntlet if she was born a white American woman?
1303769044127027201 2020-09-10 02:55:37 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @JosephPelren @MineralCup According to the woo woo sites, it helps women who struggle to orgasm. They don't specify how it helps, maybe it does the ironing or something.

1303762800620244995 2020-09-10 02:30:49 +0800 <lynas_andrew> So I turns out that the 1st UK Covid-19 death of someone who hadn't been abroad was early Jan, they became ill before Xmas. So, can everyone stop saying that those of us that think we had it at the start of Feb, are hypochondriacs.
1303760461935108107 2020-09-10 02:21:31 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @malteaser_80 They don't want infection rates to go down. That doesn't help them with their eugenics version of herd immunity. They just want the optics showing that they did "things"
1303758620501344257 2020-09-10 02:14:12 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @LeedsTransLad I only know you through this hellsite, yet it's bloody obvious that your a bloke. Terfs need to go to Castle Barnard.
1303756514474295296 2020-09-10 02:05:50 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BellaRizinti @nancywyuen I paused there for a while as well.

1303741612070244353 2020-09-10 01:06:37 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Rachael_Swindon I follow a few non-league teams on here, non as yet have tweeted to say ticket sales are being withdrawn.
1303630389001494528 2020-09-09 17:44:39 +0800 <lynas_andrew> This is what Twitter was made for...
1303611390595399680 2020-09-09 16:29:10 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Once my ex-wife lost her house keys. I found them in the bin. She'd come home drunk and decided that seeing as she was now in the house, she didn't need them anymore, and threw them away.
1303605445165281280 2020-09-09 16:05:32 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @MineralCup I lived in Cornwall for a few years &amp; absolutely love the place. I absolutely hate dentists. So any easy choice today... Lizardite is another woo woo healing crystal. Team #fluorapatite today.
1303469266969255936 2020-09-09 07:04:25 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Kinysis Just tweet that 2020 has been the best ever year you have ever had...  Then sit back and watch that number tumble.
1303467198690852871 2020-09-09 06:56:12 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @MissSp00n I have no idea what all your jobs are, but in the last 19yrs that I've been doing mine, every manager that has used that phrase has been sacked/moved on. I use it frequently to the new managers, just to see if they are daft enough to adopt it.
1303439796740775939 2020-09-09 05:07:18 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Nintendoubt815 That's because he's a fantastic Championship player, but only an occasional genius at Premiership level.
1303439197324410885 2020-09-09 05:04:56 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BellaRizinti Wouldn't we all.
1303438140208754694 2020-09-09 05:00:43 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @stavvers I've only socialised because where I live has been unaffected, but I watch the figures daily. I won't be complacent. I haven't seen a family member this year, and probably won't for another year. I've worked all the way through, I aim to keep myself safe so that I keep doing so.
1303435564230860806 2020-09-09 04:50:29 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @bbclaurak Push!?? They literally said they will break the law. So if @NicolaSturgeon said she would now break the union in a "very specific and limited way", would you report that as "pushing against"? How about Spain over Gibraltar? Argentina over The Falklands? Where does pushing stop?
1303429533266313219 2020-09-09 04:26:31 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @jbcfc__ Please don't suggest we'd only be happy with a win after several defeats 😰😰😰
1303427648497033216 2020-09-09 04:19:02 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SakuraNoSeirei I worked all the way through. I can't imagine how you've coped for so long. Massive respect, and tbf that is one hell of a journey for your venture out.
1303423107936514053 2020-09-09 04:01:00 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @KatyMontgomerie I went religious due to my upbringing, I just couldn't decide on f/m. If you'd have let slip they were American, then no brainer. Thank god that bio didn't say Utah Saints. That would have destroyed my faith in humanity.
1303414280549785601 2020-09-09 03:25:55 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @TheDryhtscipe @cadenzasmith @legalella @mikerflinn @stonewalluk It is literally any straw to cling onto to support their gatekeeping, whilst simultaneously claiming they don't gatekeep, it's those who have actually lived through this &amp; are being supportive, that are gatekeeping. Bigotry pure &amp; simple. #headhurts
1303410127119306756 2020-09-09 03:09:25 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @MineralCup Yeah, I took 4 days, but someone else appreciated my awful dad joke.
1303409559164383233 2020-09-09 03:07:09 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SakuraNoSeirei Hey babes, how did it go? ((I'm not expecting a full answer on this hellsite, or any answer at all) just letting you know, you know, hugs x).
1303408555056390144 2020-09-09 03:03:10 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @cadenzasmith @TheDryhtscipe @legalella @mikerflinn @stonewalluk I remember when Esther Rantzen was involved in the set up of Childline. "How dare children have a way of going behind their parents backs!" "Surely the parents know best!" Now we know the levels of child abuse pre '86. This is exactly the same. Kids need support, not oppression.
1303405760009973762 2020-09-09 02:52:03 +0800 <lynas_andrew> 8ish when I realised I didn't think like other boys, got explained away due to my religion (JW), that was why I was different. Late teens I suspected the real reason, mid 30's I knew, late 40's I accepted.
1303398443067596801 2020-09-09 02:22:59 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @NanoPaleoMag @MineralCup I got myself to Elite &amp; finished the 7 special missions before I went rogue.
1303395627645141000 2020-09-09 02:11:48 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @malteaser_80 Everywhere is. I can't find it now but I saw somewhere that last week the total cases were just over 9,000. We've done nearly that in the last 3 days. It's gone exponential again, the next few weeks could get grim, just in time for my holiday.
1303384759142359042 2020-09-09 01:28:36 +0800 <lynas_andrew> This really isn't my type of music, it's more the type of stuff the kids at work listen to. But I fucking love it.  https://t.co/kBtrSAW6w0
1303383711224926209 2020-09-09 01:24:27 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SakuraNoSeirei Ignorance &amp; religion damned me. Broke one belief structure down without realising I had a second one that needed the same treatment, decades of depression later, I finally realised.
1303380520844374016 2020-09-09 01:11:46 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @malteaser_80 I came down with one at the weekend, slight panic, but all fit &amp; healthy again today.
1303373822855442433 2020-09-09 00:45:09 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I don't think I've ever as an adult deliberately gone to the cinema to watch a Disney film. I was tempted by Mulan, but thankfully this angel watched it for me. I think I'll watch the Chinese version instead.
1303361753569427458 2020-09-08 23:57:11 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Jeez, walking home through the woods with a can of Jaipur, as I do. I see two dogs running around madly. Then I spot the owner, he's nailing a litre bottle of vodka, like nailing, I watched him do the last half in seconds. Bad day, week, year, who knows, but I really feel for him

1303081102438027267 2020-09-08 05:21:59 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I really should have left the pub when I finished my last beer, but I needed to drink one last pint because I was certain I was drinking the best beer in the world. The bar staff are adamant that it's Just A Tribute. #boomboom

1303073191653449730 2020-09-08 04:50:33 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Ambassador, you tease us with these tweets.
1303072366579376129 2020-09-08 04:47:16 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @joss_prior Looking over the Mersey is always a great calming moment. I think it's because all the hustle &amp; bustle is literally behind you, it helps you centre.
1303071117863784451 2020-09-08 04:42:19 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @herbiekane @jbcfc__ @BristolCity Mate, don't do this to us. We'll be in bits if you don't come back now. We could sign Messi, and still be disappointed.
1303069648167018498 2020-09-08 04:36:28 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @TheExiledRobin We all know that Eliason &amp; Fam are going to dragged out till Friday, even if they re-signed last week.
1303068319268962307 2020-09-08 04:31:11 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @joss_prior I forget you are Southport side. I see your tweets &amp; Liverpool instantly pops into my head. Completely forgetting i used to live St.Helens way. (Nostalgia is the best drug, I moved south 25yrs ago)
1303065751562211329 2020-09-08 04:20:59 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @TheExiledRobin @GeeMacGee @geoff20man @deanholdenuk Can't fault it. Two proper south Lancastrians going head to head. Absolutely fantastic listen.
1303064895655731201 2020-09-08 04:17:35 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @thejeffreymarsh I only passed through the looking glass aged 47. I finally understood the room 101 scene in the book 1984. I can't fault cis people for obsessing on body gender, because this is the only way they understand their view of self. Ignoring other people's view of self becomes bigotry.
1303061551407038470 2020-09-08 04:04:18 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity No Sess, no party.  No Fam, we riot.
1303058856881393664 2020-09-08 03:53:35 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @briebriejoy #Solidarity from across the pond. Looking after each other has no racial, religious, or gender boundaries. We are one people living on one planet. Soon we shall reach equality for all.
1303052420365324290 2020-09-08 03:28:01 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @KateWilliamsme It does slightly annoy me when the press say "taxpayers money" when the reality is it's the Treasury's money that has been covered by the profits of the Crown Estate. Yeah, we don't need the Monarchy, but if they had have been abolished, the Tories would have sold it all off.
1303047523062493184 2020-09-08 03:08:33 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Oh yeah, now may be (although you've already noticed) a good time to tell my new followers that I'm 60% football, 50% leftwing politics, 25% LGTB, 15% beer &amp; me stuff. Yes, I give 150%.
1303046184823648256 2020-09-08 03:03:14 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Sounds like the EFL can't accept they f'd up every club sanction so far, and just want to save 1% of their credibility. Hopefully they lose &amp; the 72 get the reform they need.
1303045049035501569 2020-09-08 02:58:43 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @LauraJaneGrace If I had the faintest idea what that was, I'd be tempted. Although I doubt I could obtain a passport, fly there, eat breakfast, &amp; fly back again without being late for work in 10 hrs time. Rain check?
1303042476270325760 2020-09-08 02:48:30 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @brocoli_ True, and possibly influencing capitalist corporations, but I generally find that not buying from them has more influence than signing an online form. Virtual signatures &lt; physical money.
1303040922452623362 2020-09-08 02:42:19 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @brocoli_ They piss me off. In the UK, if it isn't an @  https://t.co/BocwJ5TcCL petition they serve absolutely no purpose. Change . org &amp; 38degrees . org are just there for people to vent so that they feel better. They serve no other purpose.
1303033345643819009 2020-09-08 02:12:13 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Thank you @geoff20man &amp; @deanholdenuk that was a fantastic interview. Hearing two northwesterner's chatting like that made me miss home, but also how much I love living in Bristol. Massive respect to both of you.
1303032041387307009 2020-09-08 02:07:02 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Nintendoubt815 Sod that, listen to Deano's interview with Twentyman. It is awesome.
1303030504585916417 2020-09-08 02:00:56 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity @ashtongatestad Not now, still listening to Deano.
1303029690387632128 2020-09-08 01:57:41 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @GeeMacGee Let's see who is still on the books on Oct 5th. After that they just go out on loan.
1303029270915186688 2020-09-08 01:56:01 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BCFC_Supporters tbf, he said "AW has the choices between either coaching roles, going into broadcasting, or trying to extend his playing career". We may have offered the coaching role, we don't know, so let's wait and see what AW decides.
1303027232747786241 2020-09-08 01:47:56 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @TheExiledRobin Breath of fresh air isn't he? Hmm, isn't that what SL said we need?
1303025936955305985 2020-09-08 01:42:47 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @MikeTziorta @GeeMacGee @geoff20man It's just like overhearing a conversation in a pub,  no diss to GMG, but I think the Scouse/Manc vibe really works.
1303022439744647170 2020-09-08 01:28:53 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @GeeMacGee I'm absolutely loving this interview (I should tag @geoff20man as well) Dean is coming across with true Northern honesty. Onwards and upwards #COYR
1303019458022211584 2020-09-08 01:17:02 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @jbcfc__ "the roof is always open, especially on a Monday night" "City fans, don't go to bed early tonight"  Class 👏👏
1303017239214522370 2020-09-08 01:08:13 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @KatyMontgomerie @BellaRizinti Yeah, sometimes it's hard to keep track of everyone. Didn't realise it had been a week since she has on here. Hopefully just some her time. Sending this her way as she's missed  https://t.co/kYQ3uG2JgZ

1303013872476082176 2020-09-08 00:54:50 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @RufusTwiley1 @Poneil69 @Northern_Aaron @craig_watts @MrLloydSpandex No, I've done a few of Ian Rankin's Rebus books. There's some colloquialisms, but they're understandable enough.
1303006149982257154 2020-09-08 00:24:09 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Bristol hitting North West levels. South Glos now in the top 100. This 2nd wave is hitting quickly.
1303003870075985920 2020-09-08 00:15:05 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @KatyMontgomerie @fancywookiee What's wrong with having a career only using 3 chords?
1303002841427177472 2020-09-08 00:11:00 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Now it's hit our military, will the covidiot gammons stop claiming it's a hoax?  I doubt it. Somehow it will be those lefties fault.
1303001869896343555 2020-09-08 00:07:09 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Poneil69 @Northern_Aaron @craig_watts @RufusTwiley1 @MrLloydSpandex Right, I get it now. Yeah, I'm that age bracket that doesn't understand why people type as they say it. If I tried typing in either Scouse or Bristolian, I wouldn't know how to spell anything that came out my mouth.
1303000651576815618 2020-09-08 00:02:18 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @malteaser_80 So funny, thanks for sharing.

1302933700729024512 2020-09-07 19:36:16 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @surfacingwater Just not that awful orange one they did for a while, I think that is probably what killed off the Spira bar.
1302924736167645184 2020-09-07 19:00:38 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @stavvers I thought all reference to a time was d'reckly..
1302924146653962247 2020-09-07 18:58:18 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SakuraNoSeirei Ouch, the slow (but cheaper) train to Manchester. At least the scenery is lovely.
1302923421924438016 2020-09-07 18:55:25 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @KatyMontgomerie I just get everything delivered to work, but if that isn't an option you can set up an arrangement with the Post Office where all your mail is held at your local sorting office. I don't know if they charge for this though.
1302921940185870337 2020-09-07 18:49:32 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @HalcyonEmber Yeah, it's an English thing too, we use it to virtually everyone. Some regions interchange it with local colloquialisms, i.e South west - me lover various Northern parts - mucker etc.
1302908500499144706 2020-09-07 17:56:08 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Garstonian1 @theyellows Aren't targets deliberately set high in order to give teams focus? Lee Johnson set a five year target for Bristol City to qualify for Europe. Completely unrealistic, but without it would they have gone on that amazing Carabao Cup run?

1302874840643371008 2020-09-07 15:42:22 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @MineralCup Did my usual Google. Glaucophane doesn't appear to have any functional use. Then I googled Muscovite, it had one...  Apparently it was used as a cheaper alternative to glass windows in Elizabethan England.  Team #muscovite today.

1302517778423992320 2020-09-06 16:03:32 +0800 <lynas_andrew> How f'in wonderful. The 1st M1 of the day gets me to work over half hr late. Of the three T1's that run earlier, two have been cancelled. How many times over a week will that one not turn up??
1302247578818564096 2020-09-05 22:09:52 +0800 <lynas_andrew> 10 mins in. 1 decent shot on goal (well blocked). 2 lost balls. It's nice to sit in a stand with a pint though.

Is it really that difficult for you to accept that every single persons reality is unique to them? Mate, there are seven billion people on the planet, why can't you accept that under 2% are different.

1301969582660505600 2020-09-05 03:45:12 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @ZakiyaMedia They wouldn't fit on top of. Lose the plinth, and put a brand new commemoration there.

Less than half that price would be under £35. You are asking for £43. Now I'm happy to pay that if you give me the option of choosing between a free season ticket, or a discount code to make the price £35.
1301966127506116609 2020-09-05 03:31:28 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity 8am sharp mind, or I might cut up my season ticket..  Actually leave it till 9am, I need a lie in.

1301918721385127936 2020-09-05 00:23:06 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Nintendoubt815 @bristolcitywfc @yeovalley Agreed, why can't the heart just be an outline instead of solid. It's the only reason I've not bought one of their shirts, it just looks wrong.
1301918156412379143 2020-09-05 00:20:51 +0800 <lynas_andrew> tbf, last time I went to Wigan, I got a meat pie with mushy peas &amp; gravy.  The mushy peas &amp; gravy were INSIDE the pie.  Now that is fecking genius.
1301916594759704576 2020-09-05 00:14:39 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @RachelT1722 It's better than this monstrosity. They don't need long sleeves anymore because they are allowed to wear an long sleeved undergarment, as long as the colour is the same.  https://t.co/ixCl8SGfQE

1301914511159459840 2020-09-05 00:06:22 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @KateWilliamsme @ZakiyaMedia They deserve to be the replacement for the empty plinth in Bristol City centre.
1301913368186548226 2020-09-05 00:01:50 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @LeedsTransLad Being a Bristol City STH &amp; seeing how Leeds loved how much all the other championship teams hated you, may I wish you all the best in the premiership this season, especially as I've put three of your mob into my Fantasy Football team. This bit is going to hurt me.... #MOT
1301891647274352650 2020-09-04 22:35:31 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @famara2001 @jbcfc__ Come on big man, don't force James into making a best of reel, it would break his heart.
1301888249246384128 2020-09-04 22:22:01 +0800 <lynas_andrew> This never was a conspiracy theory. Yes, the outbreak started from someone who had been vaccinated, because it is a live virus vaccination, so it is transmissible for a short time period. It is due to a lack of widespread vaccination against type 2 polio, that it is spreading.
1301861939157573633 2020-09-04 20:37:28 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @indyfromspace Wow...
1301857780970729473 2020-09-04 20:20:56 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @djrichreason @Hyroglifics Nah, I left the northwest over 25 yrs ago. I not planning on moving back from Bristol anytime soon.

1301853799515131904 2020-09-04 20:05:07 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Good luck with your future career Shivers. You will always be a Bristol Academy/Bristol City legend #shoesoff
1301845658849116160 2020-09-04 19:32:46 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @TheMominatrixx @Kinysis I thought Democrats were supposed to be liberal?

1301838566796951552 2020-09-04 19:04:35 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity Lovely shirt ♥️♥️
1301831352476741632 2020-09-04 18:35:55 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @EL4JC Or "sorry for that, I don't recognise the number"
1301787300452536322 2020-09-04 15:40:53 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @MineralCup Easy choice today. Malachite might be really pretty, but once you scroll past the wiki link on Google, it's all woo woo nonsense. Team #lonsdaleite today. It's almost as tough as red tarmac (known for being a bit of a cycle path).
1301673689298145281 2020-09-04 08:09:26 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @YourBaroness @heavymusicawds Just get your backsides over to Europe once the current madness has ended. We are having serious withdrawal symptoms.
1301671801697767425 2020-09-04 08:01:56 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @CateSpice Biologists have found the cause. Unfortunately for terfs, it's purely biological. Absolutely nothing that they, or anyone else can do about it, except moan, gripe, &amp; get their knickers in a twist over it.
1301658640227725315 2020-09-04 07:09:38 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @zionkat @KatyMontgomerie Yes. Just do what you need to do, as and when you feel like you need to do it. There's absolutely no need to rush into transitioning. Just be you. One day at a time.  Hugs xx.
1301651024546013184 2020-09-04 06:39:22 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @ehnyay @diannaeanderson @Henriettaspoon And with that comment, you've just verified the conversation I had with my friends which I covered in that thread. The only difference is that you are to bigoted to accept that not everyone is the same as you. They did.
1301647645702840320 2020-09-04 06:25:56 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @stavvers Yes it is. Yet some people don't understand what social constructs are. I pity them.
1301647046840123392 2020-09-04 06:23:34 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @ehnyay @diannaeanderson @Henriettaspoon My thread said dysphoria isn't yes or no. You can be anywhere between 0% &amp; 100% dysphoric. At no point did i mention brain in a jar. But now thay you mention it, would I rather be a brain in a jar? No, I like being able to interact with the world, even if I have the wrong body.
1301636733449142272 2020-09-04 05:42:35 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @TheExiledRobin @ChrisJCooper92 I think Morrell and Nagy have different dynamics. It's something I can't quite put my finger on, but I really want to see them play together, so I can see it in action.
1301631379822784517 2020-09-04 05:21:18 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @ehnyay @diannaeanderson @Henriettaspoon If everybody had 100% dysphoria then you'd be absolutely correct. Did you actually read the entire thread I wrote, and if so, did you just cherry pick one part of it to reinforce your narrow view?
1301630109078769665 2020-09-04 05:16:15 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @wbuett @MineralCup I struggled to find any uses for either mineral. So either my googling skills are rubbish, or you have knowledge that Google doesn't. 🧐🧐
1301629271706873858 2020-09-04 05:12:56 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @CAvalos7 @MineralCup And orange under UV. It's like Pratchett's octarine all in one stone.
1301628440324562951 2020-09-04 05:09:37 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @HalcyonEmber @CaseyExplosion T'interweb hugs to both of you, trans or not. Oh and kisses xx.
1301627253575553031 2020-09-04 05:04:54 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @IanMitchelmore Was Morrell's performance, in your opinion good enough to force his way into a Championship 1st team, or do you think he needs more development?
1301626291519721472 2020-09-04 05:01:05 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Chr1stinaG Just went shopping in China, a pair of hiking trainer type boot, £23. That will do for the walking holiday, if they fall apart afterwards, oh well.
1301623445294374913 2020-09-04 04:49:47 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Chr1stinaG Fuck. Thanks for the reminder, I've got a holiday booked in the Lake District. Cheap Tesco converse copies won't cut it with the weather they have at the end of October. Time to get off this hellsite, and go boot shopping.
1301622402405806087 2020-09-04 04:45:38 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @astro_jje No idea what the joke was, but my take on your tweet is this.. It has nothing to do with your state of mind. I trust your reasoning, either conscious or subconscious, I'm taking your call. 98.5% of the population are idiots.
1301617169965424641 2020-09-04 04:24:50 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @aplynas I oversleep 4 out of 5 workdays, I can't understand why I'm still in a job. #keyworker #nicheposition
1301615727892406275 2020-09-04 04:19:07 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @diannaeanderson @Henriettaspoon This morning a twitter friend posted something about how GC's obsess about body parts. Your thread covers this but is a tad complex, this was my simplified response. I might be completely off the mark, if so let me know.  https://t.co/kakvxvJTPc
1301613609085292544 2020-09-04 04:10:41 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Nintendoubt815 @BristolCity Holden did say he'd seen the new home kit, but never confirmed we'd be playing in it 😬😩
1301612484923723782 2020-09-04 04:06:13 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @LeedsTransLad Hugs mate, I've been there. It sucks worst when you don't realise your depressed, that's when you spiral further down. If you've spotted it, it's still rough but you're aware you need to fight it. Again massive t'interweb hugs. Pull yourself through xx.
1301610812893810688 2020-09-04 03:59:35 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @DrJaninaRamirez It started for me on Tuesday. 6 months of walking to work and back in bliss, then where the f has all this traffic come from? Some companies chose to reopen rather than pay 10% of an employee's wage for no work.
1301606597551173633 2020-09-04 03:42:50 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BootstrapCook How can you decide? Surely it has be based on how you feel on the day? I won't accept that you thought today would be your last supper. But to be fair roasties &amp; lumpy gravy have to be on the table.
1301605619129036800 2020-09-04 03:38:56 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity @jmp_uk Yes, thank god he wasn't wearing Charlton's home shirt with a City badge on it.
1301602750644588549 2020-09-04 03:27:33 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @joss_prior Isn't it odd that biology isn't binary, it's not just animal or plant? Another example is that some species of jellyfish contain chlorophyll in their cells, so they can either float on the surface and eat sunlight, or use their tentacles to stun shrimp to eat.
1301594300279599110 2020-09-04 02:53:58 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @tinnion_brian @GeeMacGee @bcfcacademy1 I hope he has an absolute blinder &amp; forces a 1st team place. It's long overdue.
1301593429718306818 2020-09-04 02:50:30 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @jbcfc__ @RJConway92 @GeeMacGee And because we've given him a longer period of security, he might have agreed to a lower wage.
1301592764656824320 2020-09-04 02:47:52 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @cLawn92 @alidurdenBBC That would have been a clause that if he played X number of games, it's automatically extended.
1301589239763697665 2020-09-04 02:33:51 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @playmaker_EN I already have 3 Leeds players in my FF team....
1301588880207106048 2020-09-04 02:32:26 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @jet10SZN @BCFC_Supporters @BristolCity Who took what photo? That's why I said I think the blurry "leaked photo" is just a photoshop.
1301588079136968704 2020-09-04 02:29:15 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @jet10SZN @BCFC_Supporters @BristolCity And that is probably why there is a delay. We've asked for something unique.
1301587298375610371 2020-09-04 02:26:08 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Nintendoubt815 @BristolCity Yeah, have you seen Charlton's? I'm getting the feeling it was the same, and had to be changed..
1301586885521952768 2020-09-04 02:24:30 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @cLawn92 @alidurdenBBC Always the club.
1301583217124954119 2020-09-04 02:09:55 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BCFC_Supporters @BristolCity That's got to be a photoshop of the Charlton shirt.
1301581598677176322 2020-09-04 02:03:29 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BristolCity @bristolcitywfc get her on the roof!!!
1301578380618485768 2020-09-04 01:50:42 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Nintendoubt815 @BristolCity But I won't, if I want it I'll pay for it. A pretend tenner won't make me go out and spend additional money just for the sake of using the pretend tenner. Just have a flat discount for ST holders.
1301576667362668544 2020-09-04 01:43:54 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @adamrobins0n1 @jbcfc__ It costs less than the season ticket, so they are refunding that money game by game, and then it's your choice if you want to use some of it to pay to watch the game. It's the fairest way to do it.
1301575325449621504 2020-09-04 01:38:34 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Just announce it before the Wales game starts.
1301574822204506112 2020-09-04 01:36:34 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Nintendoubt815 @BristolCity I hate reward schemes. I've never had a supermarket 'clubcard' etc. It's not hard to just give a season ticket holder a set discount on any purchase. If I want something, I'll buy it, I've ordered two shirts already. A pretend tenner won't make me spend more.
1301567109500145666 2020-09-04 01:05:55 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @MikeCrosland @metrofire @AngelaRayner If a socialist stands in my constituency, I'll vote for them. I got burned by New Labour, never again.
1301566766615867393 2020-09-04 01:04:33 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @NashJanet @JudgeDuck @AngelaRayner Because it's not like bigots to misrepresent the truth to match their agenda....🤦
1301564468078538752 2020-09-04 00:55:25 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @AngelaRayner @UKLabour Key worker here. I've not taken a day of work all year, I've also had to work extra hrs because we furloughed all non essential staff (but the work still needs doing). Now you want me to give time I don't have to support a neoliberal back-up party?? Sorry I'm #socialist.
1301561788354498561 2020-09-04 00:44:46 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @jmons @RandomOriginals @SarahJ_Berry If you look at our pavements, the tarmac slopes down to the dropped kerb, so water runs off into the road.
1301560305911300107 2020-09-04 00:38:53 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I was fecking right. Just seen the club tweet about it. Some fans are kicking off.. Seriously how hard is it to read the article/email PROPERLY, instead of skimming it.
1301559349400293377 2020-09-04 00:35:05 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Dillon_Cohen @MattDavis1897 @BristolCity How hard is it for people to just read the article/email 🤷
1301558782930178048 2020-09-04 00:32:50 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Just read the update from @BristolCity re season ticket holders. 👏👏👏👏 Best solution all round. Yet knowing our fans, some will still moan.
1301556569524645889 2020-09-04 00:24:02 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @BCFC_Supporters Play him left side of the midfield 3. He can take a ball forward &amp; pass a through ball, or as he's more central have a shot himself. Also from there he can still take the ball wide &amp; cross it.
1301555478070284288 2020-09-04 00:19:42 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @YouGov I'm on of the 0% that eats after 11pm. My BMI is 17.5...

1301447281992962048 2020-09-03 17:09:46 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @SubtleInternal @Kinysis The same could be said of clothing etc, what is it about a certain bit of cloth that makes me like it? The only answer I can think of is, nothing. I'm projecting my idea of what my persona is onto that garment, and then making a random decision on whether if "it's me" or not.
1301421967254446081 2020-09-03 15:29:10 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Kinysis That's the beauty of biology, dysphoria &amp; dysmorphia are not a simple yes you've got it, or no you haven't. Everyone is somewhere on the spectrum for both of them, everybody's degree of detachment or synergy is unique to themselves.
1301417484843712515 2020-09-03 15:11:22 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @Kinysis concept that "are that we are is the several cubic centimetres inside our skulls".

1301072471521517569 2020-09-02 16:20:24 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @MineralCup I googled them both. 7th article for calcite was a woo woo healing site going on about big energy amplifiers. Several pages into albite and still no woo woo crystal nonsense. #albite gets my vote.
1300953973390815234 2020-09-02 08:29:32 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @MineralCup Seriously it's half one. I have to be getting up for work in just over 4 hrs. Stop with the retweets... There must be sociable hrs that overlap without turning me into a sleepless zombie.
1300949508965249024 2020-09-02 08:11:48 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Seriously what is it with fascists (yes anyone who's politics is to the right of mine is a fascist, (okay that's a joke) not). Does Jeremy Corbyn live in all their heads rent free (tbf he'd live at home and just grow rhubarb in their heads, and still pay them rent). #nationalhero
1300914702852255744 2020-09-02 05:53:29 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @rybdis @NuitsdeY @johnandi @UKLabourRadlett Oh, the one dimensional shit. I was born pre Thatcher, I've lived through communities being ripped apart through neoliberalism. I can see how this also works internationally. I see this fully in 3D, and am able to see it from outside of the box.
1300913405222621186 2020-09-02 05:48:20 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @rybdis @NuitsdeY @johnandi @UKLabourRadlett They are there because Venezuela wouldn't allow US companies to monopolies their resources. Socialism isn't allowed. It's modern day colonialism, but instead of invading, just cut off their supplies until they acceed.

FFS, no wonder you confuse socialism with fascism. I'm done. Enjoy your life, I'll spend my time trying to make other people's lives better, because out of the 7.5B of us, we are all equal. #Solidarity

Yet they are not because the USA strangle them with sanctions because Venezuela wants to use the profits for themselves rather than give them to USA oil companies.

As long as you are ok, why bother with a political movement that makes other people's lives better. It ha did nothing to do with Corbyn, he was just the figurehead that wobbled your world.

Anyone with the bare minimum of political history knowledge knows that the Fascist Nazis only added socialist to their name in order to win votes. Once they got into power, the 1st group they persecuted were socialists.

1300887863588986887 2020-09-02 04:06:50 +0800 <lynas_andrew> I work on. The place was opened by Maggie Fucking Thatcher. Nice one Pokémon, you've just ruined my life, just as she ruined my hometown.
1300887862125133824 2020-09-02 04:06:50 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Okay, this walky catchy thingy. It ruins walks, so I didn't turn it on going to work (sorry boss, I left home on time, it just took 3hrs to get here). Turned it on leaving work.... The nearest spinny thing is a plaque marking the opening of the industrial site (1/..)
1300883834658074628 2020-09-02 03:50:50 +0800 <lynas_andrew> Right, today my notifications have gone mental to the point they've distracted me from tweeting me things. So I'm going for a ciggy, then I might tweet something.

The poll had lots of politicians at the start, the only criteria was that none of them had ever become PM. Your narrow definition had no bearing, if it had JC wouldn't have been included.
1300834942528749571 2020-09-02 00:36:33 +0800 <lynas_andrew> @notCursedE It's always a good idea to future proof, but in my experience of PC building (albeit a while ago) the tech changes long before you reach the future. Just buy a decent spec for now, cause everything will be out of date in 48-72 months.
