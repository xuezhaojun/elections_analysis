1343738055929311232 2020-12-29 09:58:12 +0800 <Tex_968> @BmoreGreenLLC Not buying it. One Hellfire would have left more scrap. Two would have shown up on the video. I'm thinking KISS covers this but Black Ops? My radar says that crater is hinky.

It's possible he had that thing chock full of propane tanks but getting them to blow all at once?

Especially if they were on the back which would be typical. IF the RV is facing away from that camera. I THINK it is but, not enough evidence released yet.

1343708542986027011 2020-12-29 08:00:56 +0800 <Tex_968> @vabelle2010 Exactly my point. I think he deliberately tried to shape that charge and aim it at the ATT building as was done on a larger scale in Ok. City. I lost a friend in that one so I'm finding myself invested in this one too, strangely.

1343609796969295872 2020-12-29 01:28:33 +0800 <Tex_968> That looks like excess fuel to me. Also the crater is odd.

That's the RV behind at least one other vehicle. That's the source of the explosion. The only crater made on the street is there. And DNA tests take ~24 hours with the right equipment.
1343371529774620672 2020-12-28 09:41:45 +0800 <Tex_968> That's an RV and that's the source. Now I can speculate whether it's a shaped charge or not. I think the crater alone is proof that it is. More later though.   https://t.co/4PxXG2gtTX

1343305522850754562 2020-12-28 05:19:28 +0800 <Tex_968> @badboy129 I said it was possible. Doesn't mean I believe it. Right now I don't know what to believe as reporting is still so sketchy. Listen to the Mayor. I think he goes off script more than others. I'm not saying believe him. Just, crumbs.
1343297248193617923 2020-12-28 04:46:35 +0800 <Tex_968> @Patriot5714 Crater says the source was near the ATT building.
1343291242172592130 2020-12-28 04:22:43 +0800 <Tex_968> So, with the caveat about where it was parked, this shows a sophisticated VBIED attack on ATT. The black line indicates the crater from the shaped charge and the blue circle is a hole in the supposedly "bombproof" building. What all this means and WHY I'll leave up to others.  https://t.co/t2LLXPmKnh
1343291238485811200 2020-12-28 04:22:43 +0800 <Tex_968> That video implies the source was across the street from the crater. I disagree and the photographic evidence above shows that it's not true. Whatever blew up did so near the ATT building.
1343291234887069702 2020-12-28 04:22:42 +0800 <Tex_968> The outlined area is the crater created by an explosion. Supposedly from an RV. Where's the RV now? Where are the axles? The engine block? We don't know but they are highly unlikely to be near the crater. That does not mean they have ceased to exist, though that is possible.  https://t.co/C9oMoVbcN4
1343291230889926661 2020-12-28 04:22:41 +0800 <Tex_968> Another view from the morning of the 25th prior to the FAA shutting down the airspace. So far as I can discover from the photographs and reporting available there is no other crater in the area.  https://t.co/oD5CUIrZwF
1343291226318057472 2020-12-28 04:22:40 +0800 <Tex_968> That is ground zero. Next to the ATT building. Note the crater edges, where they start at the curb. Most VBIED's leave a crater directly under them. This one is different. The deepest point is next to the ATT buildings wall.  https://t.co/0aUHT20msH
1343291220202827776 2020-12-28 04:22:38 +0800 <Tex_968> This is getting ridiculous. Entirely possible that this is a suicide by a person with life issues that have his mental state utterly out of whack. I don't know and am not interested in speculating. What I can see is evidence of a sophisticated explosive device. Let's start there.

Indicates a channeled explosion. The black line outlines the crater and the blue circles a hole piercing the "bombproof" walls.

1342959441885474817 2020-12-27 06:24:16 +0800 <Tex_968> @FreedomFriesInc Just realized I conflated something. What safe crackers discovered was that plastic explosive could be "carved" to focus the explosion like a knife. That way you use far less explosive for similar results.
1342955423268220930 2020-12-27 06:08:18 +0800 <Tex_968> @robbystarbuck No clue why we trust the FBI to confirm someone sent a report to them. They lie.   oh, you meant the other thing...  my bad
1342953574817521664 2020-12-27 06:00:57 +0800 <Tex_968> @FreedomFriesInc The sandbags absorb a fraction of the explosion but help direct the majority of it the opposite direction. Tank gun rounds (HEAT, not sabot) use shaped charges.
1342952963015389189 2020-12-27 05:58:31 +0800 <Tex_968> @FreedomFriesInc In simplest terms, a directed explosive device. The principle was discovered by accident by safe crackers/ bank robbers. It's how nukes are triggered. The most simple example is placing sandbags over charges being used to deconstruct something. A bridge support, for example.
1342948721940717568 2020-12-27 05:41:40 +0800 <Tex_968> @FreedomFriesInc I mean that only someone very knowledgeable could have carried out this explosion. Other than that I have zero clues. I suppose it's possible some random person could make a shaped charge. Why?

1342909102083760128 2020-12-27 03:04:14 +0800 <Tex_968> @langdaleca My argument is that a shaped charge was used and the evidence in that picture says so. That is the extent of my argument.   And I have no idea how a 1st story hole signifies how "pointed it upwards to the second or third floor?" matches the picture.

Class 1 and sub-classes are explosives. Class 2 are LG's. Both require a 4 on the NFPA placard. Good thread on this under @LJT_is_me or @ezy06001 timeline.

That placard on that building is clearly a red 4 which means class 1 or 2. Probably not class 1 (explosive) downtown so class 2 makes it an LNG. Guessing they upgraded their boilers to LNG service. Just a guess though.

1339748271649148929 2020-12-18 09:44:13 +0800 <Tex_968> @2_guy91 I was one of a group at Texas A&amp;M that enlisted in the NG in December 1978 when the all volunteer army started. There were 11 cadets in the group iirc None of them that I know of got a star but several of our underclassmen did. One of mine commanded the 36th recently.  Thank you!

Alas, corruption was also common. 40 year cycles are truth I think. I hope the 80 year cycle prediction is wrong though, for my sons sake.

1339728359295737856 2020-12-18 08:25:06 +0800 <Tex_968> So why a shot for this one? I’m no medico. Might have to ask a cousin.

1323009681674117128 2020-11-02 05:11:03 +0800 <Tex_968> We, all patriots, must make sure they know it forevermore. THEY must change for we will not. We must not.
1323009680675950594 2020-11-02 05:11:02 +0800 <Tex_968> If we cannot keep God, Family, Country as our top three then we're shattered too. Science is not a religion. Religion is not science. Faith is STILL just as important as anything above. Even atheists have faith they just deny it. The Democratic party as it existed is done.
1323009679170162691 2020-11-02 05:11:02 +0800 <Tex_968> I've said that the parties are shattered. Defunct. This will become obvious over the next few months. The problem, OUR problem, is keeping this big tent going without making a mess of it with infighting. Conservatives are NOT the majority. We never will be, alas. But our ideals?

I'm convinced they don't believe this because "the media". The media is gone. Even if they took away social media today it's too late. I'm positive that there will be a purge like we've not seen on 11.4. Not enough.
1323004827870384131 2020-11-02 04:51:45 +0800 <Tex_968> @ZachowAa Lasted about 5 days and I finally went to the ER on the third day. I suspended my meds that day also.

1322981499478691841 2020-11-02 03:19:03 +0800 <Tex_968> They didn't test me when I went to the ER this last time but SOMETHING was trying to kill me. I've discontinued a med I've been on for years and the symptoms have slowly faded so...  But my sense of taste seems to be sharper today. Smell too.  2020 is weird.
