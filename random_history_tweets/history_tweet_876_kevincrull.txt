After this election I‚Äôm done with #MSM and #BigTech tech. I really encourage everyone to follow. The only way they can‚Äôt destroy our country is if they lose their audience.

1324084482551500801 2020-11-05 04:21:55 +0800 <kevincrull> Just maybe the #MSM and #Democrats were lying about his character??
1324016818302996481 2020-11-04 23:53:03 +0800 <kevincrull> ...&amp; finally - we MUST overhaul our voting process and rules. Voter ID is a must, if we are going to have mass mail in voting it needs WAY MORE SAFEGUARDS, and we need more automated ways of counting and recording votes. THERE MUST BE CONFIDENCE IN THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS!

If Biden wins, I hope he governs like a moderate &amp; I hope we are not facing the same #MSM and Social Media behavior going forward.
