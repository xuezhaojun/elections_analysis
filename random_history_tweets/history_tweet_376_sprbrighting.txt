Helping them will help the economy &amp; the rest of us.
1342944273805713411 2020-12-27 05:24:00 +0800 <sprbrighting> So students were defrauded, taxpayers were defrauded &amp; universities, banks, fraudulent instant colleges like Trump U made out like bandits while students never got the education they were promised or the great paying jobs they expected. It was a grand scam.
1342944271297482752 2020-12-27 05:23:59 +0800 <sprbrighting> It quickly became a grand fraud that ripped off students who were promised degrees and high income careers. Banks charged outrageous interest &amp; fees, knowing student borrowers couldn’t pay them but that we taxpayers would be stuck with the bills.
1342944269951139840 2020-12-27 05:23:59 +0800 <sprbrighting> It drove up tuitions as real &amp; fraudulent universities (Trump University) drove up tuitions &amp; gave loans knowing the students were never going to be able to repay them. Banks leant to people they knew could never make enough to repay their school costs, too.
1342944267874930688 2020-12-27 05:23:58 +0800 <sprbrighting> Anyone thinking forgiving student loans means that lower middle income workers will end up paying for those college degrees doesn’t seem to understand that taxpayers are already on the hook for those government guaranteed tuition loans.

I know several people with recurring symptoms that seem to reemerge every three to four days. They report headaches, severe fatigue, foggy brain, chest pain, rash and other COVID symptoms. We really don’t know this virus yet.
1341786338874413056 2020-12-24 00:42:47 +0800 <sprbrighting> So get ready for a major essential overhaul of our medical industry, everyone.
1341786338052358145 2020-12-24 00:42:46 +0800 <sprbrighting> It’s way past time to dump our failed employment benefit base for financing healthcare &amp; go fo Medicare for all. COVID could have been limited, but it’s way too late now. We’ll have millions of long hauler COVID victims who can no longer work or take care of their families.
1341786336533958656 2020-12-24 00:42:46 +0800 <sprbrighting> @long_covid I tweeted earlier that hospitals &amp; health insurance companies will be bankrupted by the Trump’s decision to go for “herd immunity”. Uninsured &amp; underinsured people will never be able to pay the hospitals for weeks or months of care, Heath insurers will fail.
1341775363941097472 2020-12-23 23:59:10 +0800 <sprbrighting> @DearAuntCrabby Trump abuses every rule &amp; law. Of course he’s abusing the pardon power.  He is endangering every one of us releasing convicted thieves &amp; traitors. The pardon should never be allowed for co-criminals of the person granting the pardon.

1341454848718323712 2020-12-23 02:45:33 +0800 <sprbrighting> @politico @slw2019 After republicans left one of only nine Supreme Court seats open for almost a year the democrats need to take the reins here, not seat the purported winner while they do a recount, &amp; hold their heads high. This isn’t a high school popularity contest, it’s deadly COVID reality.

1341428822520958976 2020-12-23 01:02:08 +0800 <sprbrighting> @MuellerSheWrote Ice packs for 30 minutes, aspercreme, arnica. (aspirin if your stomach can take it).   I have given away many reusable ice packs to injured friends in the last few years. We gardeners get hurt, too. Don’t suffer when you don’t have to.   I hate to know anyone is in pain.

The sooner you get to the chiropractor the sooner you will start to recover. Believe me, I know from personal experience.
1341425269136007171 2020-12-23 00:48:01 +0800 <sprbrighting> @MuellerSheWrote There are great chiropractors available on an emergency basis.

The republicans in the Senate have obstructed every move by democrats in the House of Representatives for 9 months, and then when forced, they finally let democrats give people $600 instead of the $600 per week unemployment &amp; 1200 per month that dems wanted.

1340019653834203136 2020-12-19 03:42:36 +0800 <sprbrighting> @RabbiJill I suspect Trump is waiting for Moderna vaccine approval. You need two shots &amp; they have to be the same vaccine. So Trump must have big investments in Moderna &amp; he wants few people to have the Pfizer vaccine now so Moderna can sell them their vaccine, 2 doses.

1339767214954618881 2020-12-18 10:59:30 +0800 <sprbrighting> @MedicVet68 My bet is Trump expects some payment from Moderna based on how much of their vaccine is bought by our government, so Trump isn’t taking the Pfizer vaccine that’s available &amp; better, more effective than Moderna vaccine. Making endangered people wait so he can profit somehow.

1332902658168897536 2020-11-29 12:22:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> The constitution specifically bans laws respecting an establishment of religion, so no. No laws supporting or banning them.

They should have passed adequate survival funding to keep America’s workers &amp; families fed, housed &amp; the power on during this pandemic. They helped kill more than a quarter million of us.

1331794298224852992 2020-11-26 10:57:58 +0800 <sprbrighting> @educated_educ8r I don’t because I was taught to let a worker do their job. Otherwise they might not have that job. Or they might be insulted.
1331792412268630016 2020-11-26 10:50:29 +0800 <sprbrighting> The constitution specifies that the president has the power to pardon “except in cases of impeachment” I can’t imagine a more clear cut case for Flynn’s pardon to be overturned.
1331791753691578371 2020-11-26 10:47:52 +0800 <sprbrighting> @notyour_uncle This is not your fault. We were living in a dream world thinking we were immune from viruses. You &amp; the kids are alive &amp; well, so try to just be grateful for that and love will make up for a smaller holiday.
1331789804162277376 2020-11-26 10:40:07 +0800 <sprbrighting> @SpockResists Now that Trump pardoned Flynn does he realize Flynn must testify against him if subpoenaed?

They all work the same angles. We need far more women in government &amp; business.

1330198755862327309 2020-11-22 01:17:51 +0800 <sprbrighting> I will never understand why New York courts permitted Trump to file frivolous lawsuits for literally forty years without banning him from court. It’s a vast way of bullying everyone that should not be permitted.
1330197129130889219 2020-11-22 01:11:24 +0800 <sprbrighting> Trump must be prosecuted or we will lose whatever residual faith we have in law &amp; order &amp; equal treatment under the law.   All the prosecutors he paid off or intimidated to keep him &amp; his kids from being prosecuted must be fired &amp; prosecuted if possible, too.

But he should pay us back with fed money when it’s released or set up at non-profit so we can deduct it. We’re all stretched from the virus and we’ve dug deep donating to hundreds of dem candidates.

1329468152078426113 2020-11-20 00:54:42 +0800 <sprbrighting> @williamlegate That’s the trouble with poorly educated voters. Tell them if he wins in the lower coutures there is No Need and No Reason to take a case to the Supreme Court.
1329467189808676864 2020-11-20 00:50:53 +0800 <sprbrighting> @ossoff This limiting the ban to only “individual stocks” bothers me a lot!  There are only a few thousand Federal &amp; State legislators in this whole country. None of them should be trading for their own interest while they hold any public office.

1329464035620782080 2020-11-20 00:38:20 +0800 <sprbrighting> @thomaskaine5 No!
1329214652882980864 2020-11-19 08:07:23 +0800 <sprbrighting> No unless &amp; until they are proven to be safe. Today I saw a comparison of the Moderna &amp; the Pfizer vaccines. Pfizer is much more effective at preventing long hauler survivor COVID caused side effects.

1329131627549659136 2020-11-19 02:37:28 +0800 <sprbrighting> People have always celebrated holidays at various times of the year when an absent loved one was able to attend.   There are hundreds of thousands of loved ones who will never be attending another birthday party or Thanksgiving because they died of COVID.   Celebrate later.

They don’t know what it says, so they feel free to ignore some very humane and necessary rules for dealing with others. The common law says basically the same things.

1328794827404701696 2020-11-18 04:19:09 +0800 <sprbrighting> Have them fill out &amp; deposit absentee ballots. That’s the only way you can recount. Those voting machines are hackable.

Every seven years in the Bible, which has traditionally been the time limit for forgiveness of debt in the constitution &amp; the states.

1328715911507767296 2020-11-17 23:05:34 +0800 <sprbrighting> The doctor did not mention the race of the widower. As a white person I pictured a white man, but the majority of victims of severe COVID infections are blacks, Hispanics &amp; native Americans who never had access to good medical care. Now that they vote they will improve things.
1328714185581051918 2020-11-17 22:58:42 +0800 <sprbrighting> Perhaps we can offer amends by ending our continuing racist attacks on the few surviving tribe members. Listen to them, stop stealing their lands &amp; polluting their water &amp; provide them proper hospitals, clinics &amp; schools.
1328714184058540033 2020-11-17 22:58:42 +0800 <sprbrighting> Perhaps after our terrible losses to COVID through the unconscionable purposeful slaughter of Americans by the Trumps &amp; the GOP, we can spare a moment to acknowledge the misery we have inflicted on the Indians by our own historical terrorists.
1328714181969809409 2020-11-17 22:58:41 +0800 <sprbrighting> Colonists purposefully infected native Americans with small pox. Imagine what it was like for them, driven off their lands, infected with a disease every bit as horrible as COVID that killed their babies, their grandparents, leaders &amp; healers. They had no vaccine, no antibiotics.

Preventing investigations will lead to even more anger. We’ve been lied to, ripped off, murdered, encouraged to endanger &amp; kill others. There have to be consequences.

1328136771725496320 2020-11-16 08:44:16 +0800 <sprbrighting> Someone point out to Trump that he really is not up to being president, that he’ll only dig himself a deeper hole if he keeps fighting the inevitable. He is lucky Americans who’ve had COVID or lost relatives &amp; friends haven’t overwhelmed the decimated secret service to evict him.
1328132457682464769 2020-11-16 08:27:08 +0800 <sprbrighting> @Speaker71111280 Talk about it to a suicide talk line. No one can ever really know why someone does this, but I know from it happening in my own extended family that you can gradually come to terms with it. It is not your fault.

1328013747118428162 2020-11-16 00:35:25 +0800 <sprbrighting> @6thelementearth @JillWineBanks We must make it a felony for government officials to harm anyone, including their political opponents, by misleading the public. Lies about an opponent in a campaign must be grounds for an emergency restraining order &amp; attorney fees &amp; fines.
1328013013450801158 2020-11-16 00:32:30 +0800 <sprbrighting> @6thelementearth @JillWineBanks We need to make sure textbook manufacturers produce books that are truthful, scientific &amp; do not contain false rewritten history or non- scientific religious doctrine. Right now whatever textbooks Texas buys are the only ones available to schools all over the country.
1328012316047097856 2020-11-16 00:29:44 +0800 <sprbrighting> @6thelementearth @JillWineBanks We must rebuild our infrastructure with materials that have been proven to last &amp; require long term bonds from construction companies &amp; the right to sue companies that in any way profited from construction contracts when bridges or roads do not last.
1328011626356752386 2020-11-16 00:26:59 +0800 <sprbrighting> @6thelementearth @JillWineBanks We must go back to our original patent laws which required originality, non-obviousness, etc. before a patent was granted &amp; would not have allowed patent holders to buy off or threaten companies that want to ma me generic versions of drugs &amp; devices.
1328010917024473090 2020-11-16 00:24:10 +0800 <sprbrighting> @6thelementearth @JillWineBanks We must ban food additives like hydrogenated oil (that is known to cause a huge spike in cholesterol) and high fructose corn syrup, which is a completely unnatural substance.
1328010410872631297 2020-11-16 00:22:09 +0800 <sprbrighting> @6thelementearth @JillWineBanks The FDA has become like an employee of big business. It allows chemically to be used in food &amp; cosmetics &amp; pesticides/fungicides, etc, that have not been tested &amp; proven to be safe. They must not be paid by the companies they are supposed to regulate.
1328009765167849475 2020-11-16 00:19:35 +0800 <sprbrighting> @6thelementearth @JillWineBanks The FBI reported in 2006 that police depts all over the country have been secretly recruiting racist white supremacists. They are taught not to go online with other NAZIs to avoid detection, but under Trump they were emboldened &amp; they must be removed &amp; banned from police work.
1328009177067732994 2020-11-16 00:17:15 +0800 <sprbrighting> @6thelementearth @JillWineBanks We need to rewrite our bankruptcy laws so hedge fund &amp; other businesses can’t buy companies &amp; steal funded vested pensions from workers. Bain capital has done this many times and it has cost workers &amp; taxpayers who insure pensions billions.
1328008678373421056 2020-11-16 00:15:16 +0800 <sprbrighting> @6thelementearth @JillWineBanks The FBI probably knows who they all are, where they work &amp; what they weapons they have. They have already been identified as the worst terrorist threat in America. We need to re-educate them and keep all sadists &amp; racists and misogynists out of police work.

1327769527023587328 2020-11-15 08:24:58 +0800 <sprbrighting> So hotels &amp; restaurants are the worst spreaders? Better book a VRBO. Cook or order in, avoid crowded hallways.
1327751812540108800 2020-11-15 07:14:35 +0800 <sprbrighting> That looks like the million women protest after Trump was inaugurated.
1327741541239033856 2020-11-15 06:33:46 +0800 <sprbrighting> The constitution still limits the power of the pardon. It says “except in cases of impeachment” so maybe none of his pardons since he was impeached may be binding.
1327741130855772162 2020-11-15 06:32:08 +0800 <sprbrighting> We need laws limiting presidential travel &amp; expenses, like who gets an all expense paid 10 star vacation every week? Taxpayers should not be paying for that extreme abuse of security &amp; of Air Force 1%.

1327088134077640705 2020-11-13 11:17:21 +0800 <sprbrighting> Keep calling Moscow Mitch. He’s the obstacle to help for working Americans &amp; small business owners. Won’t even let the Senate vote on relief bills passed by the House. .

1327076614589485058 2020-11-13 10:31:35 +0800 <sprbrighting> Huge staff kowtowing to his every desire, free plane travel everywhere, ability to force taxpayers to cover his security on every week vacations, great medical care, rallies paid for by tax payers. Trump had &amp; exploited the greatest grift on the planet.

1327031034160922624 2020-11-13 07:30:28 +0800 <sprbrighting> Taking on Murdoch seems like a losing battle for Trump. Murdoch looks meaner, leaner &amp; far better prepared for a drawn out battle.
1327029082962288640 2020-11-13 07:22:43 +0800 <sprbrighting> Go. And get an oxygen tester so you can get emergency help if your oxygen level suddenly drops. Don’t risk a stroke or heart attack.
1327025647395303424 2020-11-13 07:09:03 +0800 <sprbrighting> Amazing. Never knew a cat who would play fetch, although they brought us dead creatures &amp; my big white cat brought us baby rabbits, seven of them, one year. Live &amp; hungry.
1327025054891208704 2020-11-13 07:06:42 +0800 <sprbrighting> That’s why we’re talking about it. It’s one way to try to push dems who are all about healing into standing up for us. We can’t heal without getting rid of the infection in our elections.
1327023813691727873 2020-11-13 07:01:46 +0800 <sprbrighting> As a retired attorney, from what I’ve seen of their pleadings/filings lately they should be disbarred, sanctioned &amp; forced to pay the legal fees of the other parties.
1327022662170804224 2020-11-13 06:57:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> Government service probably should also be required.

I am so disappointed &amp; terrified by the rush to embrace GOP who have allowed the deaths of hundreds of thousands of us and bankrupting of thousands of small businesses &amp; working people.

We are accusing the makers &amp; purchasers of touchscreen voting machines of possible extreme voter fraud. The electronic vote totals just don’t make sense.
1326980400061669376 2020-11-13 04:09:16 +0800 <sprbrighting> @AriBerman So let’s look into republican voter fraud. What do you say about Jennifer Cohn’s @jennycohn1 reporting on WiFi modems in ES&amp;S machines?

1326933068649648128 2020-11-13 01:01:11 +0800 <sprbrighting> We also need to stop federally insuring student loans &amp; using taxpayers dollars to pay off fraudulent “colleges” for failing to educate students.

We have to outlaw hackable voting machines.
1326930333330124800 2020-11-13 00:50:19 +0800 <sprbrighting> @butterwise They’re not going to recount the down ballot races, like for Senate &amp; House of Representatives &amp; judge &amp; school board, just for president.   Otherwise they might lose control of the Senate without a run-off election.

1326664421188407298 2020-11-12 07:13:40 +0800 <sprbrighting> Why don’t’t they recount the senate races at the same time? Maybe there would be no need for run-offs.
1326663628834004993 2020-11-12 07:10:31 +0800 <sprbrighting> Do both, &amp; do both well.

1326647967781015552 2020-11-12 06:08:18 +0800 <sprbrighting> Great idea.  Many vets were victims of Trump university. Let’s pass legislation at least ending interest on student loans &amp; return to constitutional bankruptcy laws that let American students get free of crippling educational debts after 7 years.

1326615051042578432 2020-11-12 03:57:30 +0800 <sprbrighting> @diverdown48 Science is a method of examining things and coming to conclusions based one basic rule. Everyone who repeats an experiment must get the same results for it to be a fact.   Hundreds of years of evidence proves that wearing masks stops the spread of viruses. Scientific fact.

1326606766327492609 2020-11-12 03:24:34 +0800 <sprbrighting> What about when the police are white racist terrorists? The FBI reported in 2006 that police depts all over the country were quietly recruiting white supremacists, telling them To stay off social media so they didn’t get exposed. We see the damage day after day.
1326599340505276416 2020-11-12 02:55:04 +0800 <sprbrighting> Nice work.
1326598572293324801 2020-11-12 02:52:01 +0800 <sprbrighting> @AZScorpion_Tail @GOP And you can bet they were committing election fraud, too. And we need an investigation of some very suspicious senate races.
1326596902234644480 2020-11-12 02:45:23 +0800 <sprbrighting> @NanaMof5 I know there’s loads of advice, but I find Xlear with xylitol nose &amp; throat-spray &amp; drinking pure blueberry juice helpful fighting off flu in addition to the anti- virals and prescriptions. Good luck &amp; vitamin D3 is supposed to help your immune system too.

1326368716083261443 2020-11-11 11:38:39 +0800 <sprbrighting> Democrats read the Mueller report &amp; other reports of the theft of the 2016 election by Trump. We understand not only that electronic voting machines have been used to flip votes, but that they are hackable. Also, due to COVID, millions more republicans voted absentee for Biden.
1326356906667995136 2020-11-11 10:51:43 +0800 <sprbrighting> @SEvanTownsend @UviPoznansky Tell that to auto correct please.
1326356264826228738 2020-11-11 10:49:10 +0800 <sprbrighting> @B52Malmet I do not believe that 70 million voted for Trump. I believe the reports of hacked or defective touchscreen machines that switched votes from Biden to Trump.
1326338952979116034 2020-11-11 09:40:23 +0800 <sprbrighting> Exactly.
1326300569233838082 2020-11-11 07:07:51 +0800 <sprbrighting> That’ll be great for anyone who can prove the GOP fix was in on electronic votes for Senate &amp; House seats.
1326288601051660290 2020-11-11 06:20:18 +0800 <sprbrighting> @TxBlueJudgeJuJu @dupergramp Yes. Both sides were represented for the count of hand marked paper ballots. It is not possible to properly oversee the count on the touchscreen computers, however.
1326276798171152384 2020-11-11 05:33:24 +0800 <sprbrighting> In person voting uses touchscreen computers that can easily be hacked to switch votes.
1326276432205500417 2020-11-11 05:31:57 +0800 <sprbrighting> Don’t trust the touch screens.   Paper ballots, hand marked.   That way it’s very hard for the GOP to cheat again, like they did in 2016.
1326274776701173760 2020-11-11 05:25:22 +0800 <sprbrighting> @SpockResists Hopefully as soon as he announces the Biden AG they’ll will get offers to plead guilty &amp; turn in all the other grifters in Trump’s crime spree.

1326272158775926784 2020-11-11 05:14:58 +0800 <sprbrighting> @CoryBooker @Leta_says We must also investigate electronic votes for McConnell, Graham, Loeffler, Collins, other unpopular Senators who unexpectedly won.
1326271429680140288 2020-11-11 05:12:04 +0800 <sprbrighting> Biden needs to have press conferences daily. We are at war against Corona Virus &amp; electronic voting. We need his strong, rational, calm speeches.   The only thing that saved us from a second disastrous Trump term is we switched to hand marked paper ballots.
1326270146902519808 2020-11-11 05:06:58 +0800 <sprbrighting> @ReverendWarnock I just donated to both Ossof and Warnock for Senate seats in Georgia.   I dug deep because The Senate run-off in Georgia will determine who controls the US Senate.   We’ve got to retake control from McConnell &amp; the corrupt GOP or we’ll never stop Corona.

Supposed to leave areas for wildlife, like hedgerows in England between farms. But they won’t tell you that in church.  There are over 600 abominations in the Bible, and some have to do with farming, labor, cloth making.

1326213953052045317 2020-11-11 01:23:40 +0800 <sprbrighting> The GOP is the same enemy of American people that we fought in the revolutionary war. Crooked royalists who have coronated themselves and plan to enslave the rest of us. They must be defeated again every decade or so. They are  more brazen than ever.
1326212835706200064 2020-11-11 01:19:14 +0800 <sprbrighting> Sarcasm.
1326212731251273730 2020-11-11 01:18:49 +0800 <sprbrighting> India? Auto correct has really gone nuts.
1326212615522013184 2020-11-11 01:18:22 +0800 <sprbrighting> Why don’t they investigate election crimes by the GOP and Trump? Surely that’s what Barr has in India.
1326212221693652993 2020-11-11 01:16:48 +0800 <sprbrighting> @politvidchannel I would think the GOP would like to wash their hands of Trump
1325978060596760576 2020-11-10 09:46:19 +0800 <sprbrighting> Good. They can investigate the Senate races of McConnell, Graham, Collins &amp; Others.

1325937945333821441 2020-11-10 07:06:55 +0800 <sprbrighting> I remember being told our feelings don’t matter, and neither do Trump’s.
1325917479407775744 2020-11-10 05:45:36 +0800 <sprbrighting> Exactly.

1325860965749981184 2020-11-10 02:01:02 +0800 <sprbrighting> @jaketapper But we could find that there were “irregularities” in electronic voting that flipped Senate seats from blue to red.
1325848530209005568 2020-11-10 01:11:37 +0800 <sprbrighting> That’s a lot of tiny mouths to feed. With bottles every few hours day &amp; night. I did it with four kittens whose mother was hit by a car. It’s a real commitment!
1325847101335457792 2020-11-10 01:05:56 +0800 <sprbrighting> @essenviews Why would you believe Trump got that many legit votes? It has been reported by voters that their votes for Biden were flipped to Trump by electronic voting machines!
1325846715811819520 2020-11-10 01:04:24 +0800 <sprbrighting> I guess there will be thousands more Corona virus victims, then.

Don’t let Trump fool you with his relentless attacks. Trump was best friends with a proven convicted pedophile &amp; has 26 women accusing him of sexual attacks.
1325834883353120771 2020-11-10 00:17:23 +0800 <sprbrighting> @Amy_Siskind Clearly those voters must have also voted down ballot for dems.
1325834642050617347 2020-11-10 00:16:26 +0800 <sprbrighting> A gruesome laugh.
1325834373900374021 2020-11-10 00:15:22 +0800 <sprbrighting> Advertising and a few decades of relative peace lead Americans to believe we were immune from disasters.   Mother Nature is always on the assault with viruses, bacteria, droughts &amp; famine. We dance on our own graves when we ignore the myriad constant threats to life &amp; happiness.
1325833332312174592 2020-11-10 00:11:13 +0800 <sprbrighting> @thomaskaine5 Is this speculation or have they asked for immunity? If so, from whom?  Surely not states floundering financially, families bereft &amp; facing starvation &amp; eviction into a harsh winter, countless orphans, the unemployed &amp; bankrupt small business owners.   Unforgivable
1325831331100545024 2020-11-10 00:03:16 +0800 <sprbrighting> What will they do to make up for all the death &amp; destruction they have caused? As if that was possible.
1325648210535178240 2020-11-09 11:55:37 +0800 <sprbrighting> @mwheat14 @ohohyeah If they’re mailing out the ballots will everyone get theirs with the USPS still under DeJoy?
1325627225849294848 2020-11-09 10:32:14 +0800 <sprbrighting> @tonyschwartz I doubt those numbers. It seems more people voted than are of voting age in Kentucky. No one has yet investigated how GOP inflated their numbers.
1325622877706620928 2020-11-09 10:14:57 +0800 <sprbrighting> If they recount several GOP senators are likely to come up losers.
1325622086396641280 2020-11-09 10:11:48 +0800 <sprbrighting> @ACampaNajjar We also need to investigate how Graham, Collins &amp; McConnell won.
1325621563241062401 2020-11-09 10:09:44 +0800 <sprbrighting> If this is a contested election let’s investigate the mysterious wins by Lindsey &amp; Moscow Mitch. They really are suspicious.
1325607857794895878 2020-11-09 09:15:16 +0800 <sprbrighting> @PapaESoCo Fox is not a news company. It’s defines itself as pure entertainment.  We need false advertising laws applied to campaigns that hold candidates &amp; media individually &amp; jointly liable for criminal prosecution &amp; civil penalties for purposely misleading the public.
1325606794039762944 2020-11-09 09:11:02 +0800 <sprbrighting> If Trump gets a pardon he’ll have to testify against every one of his cronies. Think they’ll accept that without a fight?
1325570571086671872 2020-11-09 06:47:06 +0800 <sprbrighting> @boblister_poole @MungoMouthpiece Because they’re false.
1325567987403821056 2020-11-09 06:36:50 +0800 <sprbrighting> I bet it was dem votes that were switched to GOP. How else did Mitch get re-elected.
1325558514295533568 2020-11-09 05:59:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> @therealzanetta @BnChronicle What. Rude awakening. What does Romney know about Health &amp; Human Services? Ridiculous.
1325557516260896768 2020-11-09 05:55:14 +0800 <sprbrighting> @animal0lovers What a joy to see. Thank you.
1325527401778929664 2020-11-09 03:55:34 +0800 <sprbrighting> @J_Schiavo @BJHare Hack hack hack.
1325237607995895809 2020-11-08 08:44:02 +0800 <sprbrighting> @VibinWoosh @JoshuaPotash What is this?
1325237454584963074 2020-11-08 08:43:25 +0800 <sprbrighting> Racism is learned. It can be unlearned.
1325237050413445120 2020-11-08 08:41:49 +0800 <sprbrighting> Gotta turn them back toward reality &amp; the light. Race is an illusion.
1325203361923100673 2020-11-08 06:27:57 +0800 <sprbrighting> @BevDiane And we’ll be here supporting you.
1325202780919791616 2020-11-08 06:25:38 +0800 <sprbrighting> If we can’t make an example of Trump, we can never trust a president again. There must be consequences for white collar crimes &amp; all those deaths from COVID.
1325202087412604928 2020-11-08 06:22:53 +0800 <sprbrighting> @CaptMarkKelly @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris It’ll be heart warming.
1325201702841020416 2020-11-08 06:21:21 +0800 <sprbrighting> Better hang on til he’s gone from theWH, then. Sorry. Glad it’s not me.
1325199470510837760 2020-11-08 06:12:29 +0800 <sprbrighting> @BevDiane Oh don’t do that!
1325199323064266752 2020-11-08 06:11:54 +0800 <sprbrighting> @McJesse @4a_of Inspiring.
1325199099470123009 2020-11-08 06:11:00 +0800 <sprbrighting> @McJesse @4a_of Best pic of the day.
1325198530642804736 2020-11-08 06:08:45 +0800 <sprbrighting> And thank you.
1325198139763036165 2020-11-08 06:07:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> I think Trump gave all of us potty mouth.
1325197574609928193 2020-11-08 06:04:57 +0800 <sprbrighting> @DebRobertsABC So much advice.   Graviola/pawpaw really can help.   Makes great tea, delicious fruit. If you listen to one tweet, make it this one. Graviola/pawpaw fruit, bark &amp; leaves all help.
1325197006969565184 2020-11-08 06:02:42 +0800 <sprbrighting> @workingwithdave Immediately get him Graviola. Or pawpaw. Purdue University research proved it much stronger than chemo &amp; it can’t hurt you. Eat the fruit, make tea from bark &amp; leaves, take capsules. Get it online. Saved 2 members of my family and one friend. Helps against breast cancer too.
1325196138975121409 2020-11-08 05:59:15 +0800 <sprbrighting> Some of these great old ships are still sailing. Nothing like the sound when the wind takes the sail.
1325195039585103872 2020-11-08 05:54:53 +0800 <sprbrighting> @thomaskaine5 Thank you for your excellent work. Winner!
1325181792987410434 2020-11-08 05:02:14 +0800 <sprbrighting> @Olivianuzzi Well said.
1325179464372916225 2020-11-08 04:52:59 +0800 <sprbrighting> Sore losers. But remember the women’s anti Trump March. Millions.
1325167023354044421 2020-11-08 04:03:33 +0800 <sprbrighting> My sister, my niece, her husband and their toddler son have COVID. All adults are very sick. And I am heart sick. Birthday party with no masks.
1325166442317115392 2020-11-08 04:01:14 +0800 <sprbrighting> @MaryanneChisho2 Excellent. Already done.
1325137075641806852 2020-11-08 02:04:33 +0800 <sprbrighting> Except to follow the investigations &amp; the trials.
1325136565652217859 2020-11-08 02:02:31 +0800 <sprbrighting> @davidhogg111 We have all won. Now we have to take back the Senate.
1325136224240087044 2020-11-08 02:01:10 +0800 <sprbrighting> @StephenKing Stick a fork in Trump. He’s done.
1325136080077611010 2020-11-08 02:00:35 +0800 <sprbrighting> @AVindman @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Thank you for your courage. You helped save America’s future.
1325131529199128588 2020-11-08 01:42:30 +0800 <sprbrighting> @inthesetimesmag It’s up to Mitch McConnell. Tell him!
1325131308784250882 2020-11-08 01:41:38 +0800 <sprbrighting> @ProjectLincoln @lori_stella75 Who killed hundreds of thousands of Americans instead of wearing a damn mask.
1325130293498404865 2020-11-08 01:37:36 +0800 <sprbrighting> @Jillbiden46 @Pajjr2016 I’m so glad there are no naked pix of our First Lady on Twitter.
1325127943480205316 2020-11-08 01:28:16 +0800 <sprbrighting> Yes it was. Thank you Stacey
1325125752250007553 2020-11-08 01:19:33 +0800 <sprbrighting> Hey evangelicals! The Antichrist has been defeated.   Is Joe Biden the second coming or is it Kamala Harris? Or Elizabeth Warren? Or???  Will we have to engage his followers to clean up the mess?
1325124925145845762 2020-11-08 01:16:16 +0800 <sprbrighting> @thomaskaine5 We have to forgive them &amp; help them be better Americans.   Many people can be mislead by a funny loudmouth clown who promises but never delivers. That’s why children &amp; many adults are afraid of clowns. Or hate clowns. They exist to misdirect us.
1325123619932921858 2020-11-08 01:11:05 +0800 <sprbrighting> @mikefarb1 Absolutely  They will change other race outcomes.
1325123154574942214 2020-11-08 01:09:14 +0800 <sprbrighting> Phones not or king in AZ. Are they over loaded?
1325120798168809476 2020-11-08 00:59:52 +0800 <sprbrighting> Suddenly everything feels right in the world. The most beautiful autumn day I’ve ever seen.
1325105828160962560 2020-11-08 00:00:23 +0800 <sprbrighting> How long has this species been around?
1325102514878906369 2020-11-07 23:47:13 +0800 <sprbrighting> Yes.
1325101719097765888 2020-11-07 23:44:03 +0800 <sprbrighting> He must be indicted by the states where he attacked the post office to disrupt the election.
1325100939452190721 2020-11-07 23:40:57 +0800 <sprbrighting> I am also very grateful for everything Project Lincoln did to awaken republicans &amp; get them to vote for Biden.
1325099872538669056 2020-11-07 23:36:43 +0800 <sprbrighting> Jennifer Cohn, thank you for your tireless work alerting us to the threat hackable electronic voting machines.   I have retweeted &amp; quoted you &amp; repeated your warnings over &amp; over but nothing will ever be enough to show you how I appreciate &amp; admire you.   How can I help?
1325098712603918338 2020-11-07 23:32:06 +0800 <sprbrighting> You can thank Jennifer Cohn @jennycohn1 for alerting us over &amp; over to the danger of hackable electronic voting machines and who drove me &amp; millions of others to get a paper ballot  and hand mark it.   Noble prize would not be enough of a commendation.
1325096955970641921 2020-11-07 23:25:08 +0800 <sprbrighting> Some Trump supporters are getting an education in consequences from the corona virus.   Wonder if they’ll learn as much from getting sick as they will about cheats when Trump dumps them.
1325096258919301120 2020-11-07 23:22:21 +0800 <sprbrighting> There are hundreds of empty cruise ships they could rent for an exodus of right wing extremists, but Trump’s made us a pariah nation.  2 weeks quarantine on board &amp; they Might get in, but like other refugees, they might not.
1325095533233336321 2020-11-07 23:19:28 +0800 <sprbrighting> Maybe their husbands selected the candidate.
1324938248586604544 2020-11-07 12:54:29 +0800 <sprbrighting> I’ll bet those machines turned Biden votes into Trump votes. And I’ll bet they insured that McConnell, Rubio &amp; Graham are still Senators.
1324935566148792326 2020-11-07 12:43:49 +0800 <sprbrighting> @CharlesBenson4 More than half the country didn’t want to accept a Trump win either, but we were forced to suffer through 4 years of bigotry, misogyny, child separations &amp; law breaking. Suck it up kid.
1324932355446829057 2020-11-07 12:31:04 +0800 <sprbrighting> Exceptional.
1324928984317005824 2020-11-07 12:17:40 +0800 <sprbrighting> @mcspocky Yes. They counted the votes.
1324907391117242370 2020-11-07 10:51:52 +0800 <sprbrighting> @Gigisaysthis1 @marjowil5775 Just Trump? What about Senators who took Russian money?
1324907095578173441 2020-11-07 10:50:41 +0800 <sprbrighting> Gore conceded without any trace of a fight. Sad.
1324906693847707649 2020-11-07 10:49:06 +0800 <sprbrighting> @shannonrwatts Get take out &amp; a nice bottle of wine, or seltzer, or milk.
1324905851786702850 2020-11-07 10:45:45 +0800 <sprbrighting> @macy5875 Well done.
1324905786330419201 2020-11-07 10:45:29 +0800 <sprbrighting> @macy5875 Yes. She should not be trying to influence a client politically.
1324903499126042624 2020-11-07 10:36:24 +0800 <sprbrighting> Hacked electronic voting machines?
1324902867770224647 2020-11-07 10:33:53 +0800 <sprbrighting> @Defeat_Trump2 @politicususa Couldn’t he behave with honor &amp; civility just once?
1324902447618220034 2020-11-07 10:32:13 +0800 <sprbrighting> Only for crimes he fully discloses now &amp; agrees to assist in prosecution of coconspirators. That’s pretty standard.
1324889883182166016 2020-11-07 09:42:18 +0800 <sprbrighting> @RBReich He won’t have much help making us miserable. Rats are leaving the ship.
1324835787569995777 2020-11-07 06:07:20 +0800 <sprbrighting> @politvidchannel Why do we have a president who needs to constantly be coddled. Thank god we’ll have an adult in Joe Biden.
1324835188044525568 2020-11-07 06:04:57 +0800 <sprbrighting> @priyachandscifi Yes. Every single position matters.
1324834983979048960 2020-11-07 06:04:09 +0800 <sprbrighting> @RickNothing Agreed. And we need to write every normal procedure ignored by Trump as a law, passed by the House &amp; Senate &amp; signed by the president so no EOs can be used to sidestep congress &amp; the will of the people.
1324828836622577664 2020-11-07 05:39:43 +0800 <sprbrighting> @CarIegend And soon to be evicted!
1324764113164099585 2020-11-07 01:22:32 +0800 <sprbrighting> @gregolear I’m so cheerful today. Biden lead grows.
1324763681465401344 2020-11-07 01:20:49 +0800 <sprbrighting> 🌺🍭🎂
1324763303202074625 2020-11-07 01:19:19 +0800 <sprbrighting> @mspoint1106 @PhiKapMom Nhappy birthday.
1324763179797291008 2020-11-07 01:18:49 +0800 <sprbrighting> I have many chapter titles in my Repairing America book, Including rewriting patent laws, revising FDA procedures, funding research &amp; ending the 90% control of our media by right wing American oligarchs. We have our work cut out for us.
1324760720781684736 2020-11-07 01:09:03 +0800 <sprbrighting> 4. Toss the Bush anti-bankruptcy relief laws, allowing students to be freed from tuition loans after 7 years of good faith repayment.   Refinance student loans at interest rates comparable to the bank overnight rates.   We all benefit from having an educated population.
1324760719909285890 2020-11-07 01:09:03 +0800 <sprbrighting> 2. Take back military weapons from the police.  3. Free   a. Everyone who was forced (extorted) to plead guilty or no contest to drug charges or face years in jail, b. Everyone arrested for exercising their right to vote or to peacefully protest.
1324760719095558144 2020-11-07 01:09:02 +0800 <sprbrighting> I’ve been working on a book of what needs to be done to clean up the GOP/Trump/American Oligarch mess. It’s looking very long &amp; incredibly complex. Many chapters.   1. I’d start by shutting down ICE.     Then fund &amp; restaff our immigration department. Kids are suffering &amp; dying.
1324750262905446400 2020-11-07 00:27:30 +0800 <sprbrighting> I was up working out what needs to be done to save America after Trump is gone.   Don Wilson &amp; the other amazing patriots posting brilliant ads need to hang in there.   We need to spend every second educating the public about politics &amp; the economy &amp; the cruel folly of racism.
1324749303051530242 2020-11-07 00:23:41 +0800 <sprbrighting> @NWPinPDX He can skip out.   Pence could join him or face whatever public wrath may arise. Presumably Pence knew of and perhaps benefited from any illegal acts.   If we prove that the 2016 election was stolen by fraud, Pence surely benefitted.   Speaker Pelosi is ready.
1324746674607067137 2020-11-07 00:13:14 +0800 <sprbrighting> This could be as complex as any case since WWII.
1324746673747193856 2020-11-07 00:13:14 +0800 <sprbrighting> The Hague may find the child deaths in custody on the border were manslaughter or genocide. Surely Pence can’t pardon him for international crimes against humanity.
1324746672929296384 2020-11-07 00:13:14 +0800 <sprbrighting> What if we find evidence that he assisted in a killing? Or rape?
1324746672006549504 2020-11-07 00:13:13 +0800 <sprbrighting> And what if we find out later that he has grifted billions in payoffs &amp; kickbacks from no-bid contracts with buddies or foreign countries? Can he be blanket pardoned for crimes we don’t know about?
1324746671171932160 2020-11-07 00:13:13 +0800 <sprbrighting> The police are free to lie to get suspects to disclose incriminating evidence. So couldn’t whoever negotiates with a deposed former president say he’ll be pardoned or won’t face charges? Or should impeached former presidents get special care?
1324534966139543552 2020-11-06 10:11:59 +0800 <sprbrighting> Put a jail cell in his future, as an inmate.
1324533316247150592 2020-11-06 10:05:25 +0800 <sprbrighting> Stop letting Texas determine what text books American schools use.
1324525469480349697 2020-11-06 09:34:15 +0800 <sprbrighting> What if Trump hacked the electronic voting? Maybe they did. Without paper ballots how would we ever know?
1324524917090480129 2020-11-06 09:32:03 +0800 <sprbrighting> The fact that Biden is going to win based on hand written paper ballots should finally lay to rest all electronic voting. Hand written paper ballots can’t be hacked &amp; changed.
1324517439250460673 2020-11-06 09:02:20 +0800 <sprbrighting> What about FaceBook?
1324501212121559040 2020-11-06 07:57:51 +0800 <sprbrighting> Isn’t he in jail?
1324500993766121472 2020-11-06 07:56:59 +0800 <sprbrighting> I just donated to both dem candidates for the run-offs for Senator from Georgia. Hurray.
1324493372979990534 2020-11-06 07:26:42 +0800 <sprbrighting> I’ve been thinking about having no electoral college.   If people in rural red states feel as angry &amp; under represented as we big blue state residents felt while it was in effect, then we need to fix that?   We need everyone to feel represented.   How?
1324485531418292224 2020-11-06 06:55:33 +0800 <sprbrighting> I’m so sorry. It’s a terrible &amp; relentless disease.   It will take the whole country at full attention to overcome it now that it has been allowed to spread unhindered by adult supervision.   The adults are retaking control. Stay vigilant. We mourn with you.
1324433805092954112 2020-11-06 03:30:00 +0800 <sprbrighting> I don’t believe Trump got as many votes as reported. I have read a number of people who said their votes for Biden were switched to Trump. Don’t trust electronic voting machines. Many are reported to have WiFi modems. Demand paper ballots you hand mark.
1324432404937781249 2020-11-06 03:24:26 +0800 <sprbrighting> Fire that teacher for being so poorly educated that she believes those lies without even bothering to research what she is blathering.
1324429700127551488 2020-11-06 03:13:41 +0800 <sprbrighting> No! Pardons are fir people who have admitted their crimes and are remorseful.
1324400080271540225 2020-11-06 01:15:59 +0800 <sprbrighting> Desperation?
1324368172330352643 2020-11-05 23:09:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> @MCmuckraker She’s exposing herself to COVID.
1324367451585351680 2020-11-05 23:06:20 +0800 <sprbrighting> Hurray!
1324367271444115457 2020-11-05 23:05:37 +0800 <sprbrighting> With a new attorney general we can indict any Senators who illegally took foreign money for their campaigns which reportedly includes McConnell, Rubio &amp; Graham.
1324199468690890754 2020-11-05 11:58:50 +0800 <sprbrighting> Do doctors have check lists like pilots or do they just wing it based on insurance company payment codes? Don’t you think doctors should not have to spend their time figuring out what the right code is for your medical treatment instead of helping you recover?
1324198098491506695 2020-11-05 11:53:23 +0800 <sprbrighting> Over acting.
1324183019100332032 2020-11-05 10:53:28 +0800 <sprbrighting> Too bad Trump thinks being called a loser is worse than being called a cheat.
1324162963192770560 2020-11-05 09:33:46 +0800 <sprbrighting> Bush stopped the Florida count so Gore lost.
1324152442020245504 2020-11-05 08:51:58 +0800 <sprbrighting> Maybe the voting machines were hacked.
1324133218832904194 2020-11-05 07:35:35 +0800 <sprbrighting> Always seems creepy to me.
1324130642485891073 2020-11-05 07:25:20 +0800 <sprbrighting> Or bringing in the shredders.
1324125437744672768 2020-11-05 07:04:40 +0800 <sprbrighting> Why would they have post marked ballots they were not going to turn in?
1324094322103316480 2020-11-05 05:01:01 +0800 <sprbrighting> No Democrat should ever concede.
1324076045385965569 2020-11-05 03:48:24 +0800 <sprbrighting> Another stolen election?
1324067189452730368 2020-11-05 03:13:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> Take heart. Disasters like the Trump administration often precede great social justice movements.
1324066901073354753 2020-11-05 03:12:03 +0800 <sprbrighting> I was in Whole Foods. A clerk was restocking the shelves and sighed deeply. I asked “are you having a bad day?“ He laughed. “No, that was a sigh of happiness. Things are going to get better.” Knowing Biden is winning even after all the voter suppression &amp; stolen ballots, I agree.
1324065555087716352 2020-11-05 03:06:42 +0800 <sprbrighting> No one should concede until every ballot is retrieved from the evil postmaster general. There may be 27% of the ballots still undelivered due to DeJoy.
1324061101240184832 2020-11-05 02:49:01 +0800 <sprbrighting> They’d better get that $3 mil in advance.
1324011875915374592 2020-11-04 23:33:24 +0800 <sprbrighting> Because democrats follow the science and protect themselves from COVID &amp; your armed terrorists by voting by mail instead of standing in eleven hour long lines to use hackable machines that can flip your vote IF they are working at all.
1324010429257936898 2020-11-04 23:27:39 +0800 <sprbrighting> Only because the average American doesn’t realize they’re paying insane prices to use the internet we designed, built &amp; own through taxpayer investment. Also they don’t know that those companies are making billions without paying any taxes.
1323768042245947393 2020-11-04 07:24:30 +0800 <sprbrighting> Democrats wrote &amp; voted in the House of Representatives to give you that $1200, the House is controlled by dems &amp; they control the federal purse. Learn your civics.
1323723739087859713 2020-11-04 04:28:27 +0800 <sprbrighting> We went for hamburgers &amp; fish &amp; chips.
1323722637994983424 2020-11-04 04:24:05 +0800 <sprbrighting> Every second of your videos has been excellent &amp; heart wrenching. Thank you so much.
1323709356035072000 2020-11-04 03:31:18 +0800 <sprbrighting> Excellent.
1323708586757824513 2020-11-04 03:28:15 +0800 <sprbrighting> It’s been a terrible four years. Welcome a better future today. Vote.
1323707430308511744 2020-11-04 03:23:39 +0800 <sprbrighting> Nice guy.
1323705815715336192 2020-11-04 03:17:14 +0800 <sprbrighting> What a great idea.
1323671160244989952 2020-11-04 00:59:31 +0800 <sprbrighting> Democrats want to improve America forever for the better. Yes. Exactly.
1323668392851595265 2020-11-04 00:48:32 +0800 <sprbrighting> Don’t they have provisional ballots?
1323666126945939457 2020-11-04 00:39:31 +0800 <sprbrighting> Almost as bad an idea as electing him president.
1323663670027735040 2020-11-04 00:29:46 +0800 <sprbrighting> Who is profiting from this travesty?
1323662502740127744 2020-11-04 00:25:07 +0800 <sprbrighting> Pelosi is correct. The Senate rules require that at least 2 members of the opposing party be present to confirm a Supreme Court Justice. There were none present.
1323423028487712768 2020-11-03 08:33:32 +0800 <sprbrighting> Important to watch.
1323336417880145920 2020-11-03 02:49:23 +0800 <sprbrighting> Sanctuary cities do Not protect criminals. Implying that they do like this seems criminal to me.
1323296923382554624 2020-11-03 00:12:26 +0800 <sprbrighting> @dlian3 @tinyboo49 @ProjectLincoln What?
1323295608040382464 2020-11-03 00:07:13 +0800 <sprbrighting> Siblings.  https://t.co/eO3cTd2J6S
1323290027657326593 2020-11-02 23:45:02 +0800 <sprbrighting> Could be more like flash mobs.
1323288220562419713 2020-11-02 23:37:51 +0800 <sprbrighting> Is he still running ads for paid “supporters” to attend these rallies? Is he stiffing those actors, too, or just leaving them freezing &amp; stranded in the cold? Wouldn’t that be a labor crime?   Or are these actually Trump supporters getting some of what they have earned?
1323287356334460929 2020-11-02 23:34:25 +0800 <sprbrighting> His great and unmatched godless greed is beyond his supporters’ comprehension.
1323087954139439104 2020-11-02 10:22:04 +0800 <sprbrighting> That was all pre boomers being in charge of anything. That catsup thing was Reagan. So was the racist war on drugs &amp; the Vietnam war.
1323087309638520833 2020-11-02 10:19:31 +0800 <sprbrighting> No!
1323076196632985601 2020-11-02 09:35:21 +0800 <sprbrighting> Is this another Chris Christie bridge gate? Where are the police with their batons, tire slicing knives &amp; tear gas?
1322991094926241793 2020-11-02 03:57:11 +0800 <sprbrighting> I guess reporters are targeted by police because they tell the truth about police racism &amp; brutality. What other reason could there be to attack our constitutionally protected free press?
1322948107735162881 2020-11-02 01:06:22 +0800 <sprbrighting> Pretty shocking when a man who has never married gives marital advice to women who have watched their mothers suffer through insufferable traditional marital misery. Plus if women stay home the economy will bottom out.
1322575877616533504 2020-11-01 00:27:16 +0800 <sprbrighting> @manny_rosen @IvankaTrump Check out the revolving hair colors.
1322575464813137920 2020-11-01 00:25:37 +0800 <sprbrighting> @sasasandykind @IvankaTrump You think she wasn’t a phony because they’re posed in cowboy clothes you have never seen them wear any ther time in their lives?
1322572375976603648 2020-11-01 00:13:21 +0800 <sprbrighting> State prosecutions for interfering with the election could take place now.
1322570756866232321 2020-11-01 00:06:55 +0800 <sprbrighting> The Pope is against Trump, the generals are against Trump, the teachers &amp; doctors &amp; nurses &amp; firefighters &amp; minorities are against Trump, the women he attacks &amp; insults are against Trump. If you’re still voting for Trump, ask yourself why?
1322568591196090369 2020-10-31 23:58:18 +0800 <sprbrighting> So easy to imagine these exact words accusing Trump, &amp; his killer virus of destroying this whole country. #Trump’sKillerVirus
1322566311973580802 2020-10-31 23:49:15 +0800 <sprbrighting> @funder Respectfully, that’s longer than it needs to be. How about #ForJoe

1322386548751433728 2020-10-31 11:54:56 +0800 <sprbrighting> Bush has been unforgivable since Iraq.
1322383490067832832 2020-10-31 11:42:47 +0800 <sprbrighting> @SethAbramson @Darlene_Edw I wouldn’t call his women victims “girlfriends”.
1322381442911928321 2020-10-31 11:34:39 +0800 <sprbrighting> He fired Vindman for telling the truth under oath, and fired.Vindman’s brother, too, for extra nasty revenge. Sicko.
1322379328676487168 2020-10-31 11:26:15 +0800 <sprbrighting> @chandraxray @mwagner777 Extraordinary. NASA rules.
1322376147078836225 2020-10-31 11:13:36 +0800 <sprbrighting> Amazing to see flames in ultra slo-mo.
1322374399324905473 2020-10-31 11:06:39 +0800 <sprbrighting> @MeidasTouch The link was working tonight.
1322373981941297152 2020-10-31 11:05:00 +0800 <sprbrighting> I donated again tonight. Thank you for your great ads.
1322372694780702720 2020-10-31 10:59:53 +0800 <sprbrighting> Sorry, Miami Dade post office.
1322372436885606400 2020-10-31 10:58:52 +0800 <sprbrighting> @GeorgeServed @kionnemcghee @DevonHesano @AmandiOnAir @PeterSchorschFL @MarcACaputo @GlennaWPLG @CNNPolitics @NewsbySmiley @realDonaldTrump And every post office manager who is ignoring the court order to process this mail should be arrested for contempt of court also. Who sent the police to the post office in PA? Hopefully it was the judge.
1322370437163098113 2020-10-31 10:50:55 +0800 <sprbrighting> @americanpecan It’s generally pea-can in the south, peacohn everywhere else.
1322370178521329664 2020-10-31 10:49:53 +0800 <sprbrighting> Don’t sort the rest of the mail, just pull the ballots from those crates &amp; get them to the elections board.
1322369677713047553 2020-10-31 10:47:54 +0800 <sprbrighting> I just checked the status of my Arizona ballot. Very quick, 90 seconds or less, and it was accepted. Hurray.
1322364031051575296 2020-10-31 10:25:27 +0800 <sprbrighting> The “nothing” is Donald Trump Jr.
1322360327279841280 2020-10-31 10:10:44 +0800 <sprbrighting> @RealGravitas @laurie_ohio We got an oximeter for less than $20. It helps you track your oxygen level so you know to get to the hospital if it falls too much.
1322359102589161472 2020-10-31 10:05:52 +0800 <sprbrighting> @DesignationSix I really don’t care, do you?

1322353953560948737 2020-10-31 09:45:25 +0800 <sprbrighting> Outlander, Doc Martin, Maine Cabin Masters, Alaska the Last Frontier, nurse Jackie, any PBS mystery series.
1322248782298243072 2020-10-31 02:47:30 +0800 <sprbrighting> Not without an amendment, but we can grant statehood to territories &amp; increase the number of federal judges, which is really needed desperately, and the number of Supreme Court Justices to reflect at least the huge increase &amp; shift of population.
1322244894690144256 2020-10-31 02:32:03 +0800 <sprbrighting> I rely on the Legal Defense Fund to inform every American of their rights
1322239319076036608 2020-10-31 02:09:54 +0800 <sprbrighting> How about we donate to pay overtime for postal workers &amp; bring in food &amp; take care of pets like we do when there’s a flood or fire. I can’t get there, was a postal worker in college, but I’ll donate.
1322238852212256771 2020-10-31 02:08:03 +0800 <sprbrighting> We call up retired military when needed, we called up retired nurses &amp; healthcare workers to fight COVID, we bring firefighters from all over the country to fight major fires, let’s get every postal worker on a plane to Florida to get this mess cleared out.
1322237560265994240 2020-10-31 02:02:55 +0800 <sprbrighting> An old man groping a young actress.
1322229252985483265 2020-10-31 01:29:54 +0800 <sprbrighting> Good idea.
1322229185608216576 2020-10-31 01:29:38 +0800 <sprbrighting> @mmpadellan We grew a lot of small baking pumpkins, very sweet. We’ll drop them at the neighbors. We invited kids to pick one from the pumpkin patch instead of truck or treat. It gave them 2 projects. Bake something &amp; carve a face in the pumpkin. Trick or treating is just not safe.
1322227449040568321 2020-10-31 01:22:44 +0800 <sprbrighting> @20jarett24 Is there something to be gained by posting this rant?
1322226508010713089 2020-10-31 01:18:59 +0800 <sprbrighting> I’ll go back to posting art, poetry &amp; short films.
1322226195233009666 2020-10-31 01:17:45 +0800 <sprbrighting> To Russia???
1322225952097628160 2020-10-31 01:16:47 +0800 <sprbrighting> Had me in tears, hopeful ones.
1322008929623187456 2020-10-30 10:54:25 +0800 <sprbrighting> @GeekTalk51 @WisePaxCat So Trump took over 3 million $ from 9/11 first responders? Doesn’t this deserve better media coverage? Why hasn’t the FBI or some criminal investigator told the American people about this. Wonder how the NYPD might feel about Trump if they knew this.
1322003330101514242 2020-10-30 10:32:10 +0800 <sprbrighting> @RedTRaccoon Garbage in, garbage out.
1321898926753017856 2020-10-30 03:37:18 +0800 <sprbrighting> @Leslieoo7 What a mess. And are those hair implants?
1321888602188472320 2020-10-30 02:56:16 +0800 <sprbrighting> I hope they’re disconnecting the WiFi modems illegally in voting machines.
1321887431335927809 2020-10-30 02:51:37 +0800 <sprbrighting> That does not look like Melania &amp; he never kisses Melania. Fake wives. Fake wives!
1321863338612023296 2020-10-30 01:15:53 +0800 <sprbrighting> It used to be illegal, and media were required to provide equal amount of equal quality time to all parties. We own the airwaves &amp; the internet &amp; they should not be able to manipulate elections, but right now that’s what FB is doing.
1321862750386049024 2020-10-30 01:13:33 +0800 <sprbrighting> They’re controlling content so they’re a media.
1321862440682860544 2020-10-30 01:12:19 +0800 <sprbrighting> I deleted FB years ago when it became clear they were an arm of the republican oligarch despots.
1321507692905594881 2020-10-29 01:42:41 +0800 <sprbrighting> Is this terrorist in jail yet?
1321507477515505665 2020-10-29 01:41:49 +0800 <sprbrighting> Isn’t it sickening!
1321506361545355264 2020-10-29 01:37:23 +0800 <sprbrighting> And the lesson is: Don’t Trust Trump.
1321281951504818176 2020-10-28 10:45:40 +0800 <sprbrighting> Oh no. Have you been evacuated?
1321245806591045635 2020-10-28 08:22:02 +0800 <sprbrighting> Terrifying news.
1321242467652390915 2020-10-28 08:08:46 +0800 <sprbrighting> Fine men, fine job.
1321241093116026881 2020-10-28 08:03:18 +0800 <sprbrighting> How &amp; why did Trump get those loans forgiven?
1321226185104191489 2020-10-28 07:04:04 +0800 <sprbrighting> Don’t ever forget, she’s anti union and anti worker.
1321225265343651840 2020-10-28 07:00:25 +0800 <sprbrighting> Maybe he wants to keep whatever money he does have for his escape from America. Whatever he doesn’t spend.
1321195138836672512 2020-10-28 05:00:42 +0800 <sprbrighting> The person who’s has dementia wrote &amp; produced that ad, and it’s not Joe Biden.
1321194502082576384 2020-10-28 04:58:10 +0800 <sprbrighting> Good. They’re not supposed to run false advertising.
1321177135894020096 2020-10-28 03:49:10 +0800 <sprbrighting> If Trump had handled the virus like Obama/Biden handled H1N1 we’d be back at work &amp; school &amp; there’d be 200:000 fewer grieving families.
1320994579449954304 2020-10-27 15:43:45 +0800 <sprbrighting> @JoshuaPotash Surely they could have tased him.

1320914320801185792 2020-10-27 10:24:50 +0800 <sprbrighting> Yes.
1320827875482742784 2020-10-27 04:41:19 +0800 <sprbrighting> @AlexanderAbdo @LauraEdelson2 Oh that is so funny. Facebook, the place for every lying ad &amp; bit of Russian propaganda is upset because people are investigating them. That’s not something they can stop with all the money they’re able to hoard up.
1320826445673852928 2020-10-27 04:35:39 +0800 <sprbrighting> Delt Air Lines is for profit, not for people, unlike caregiving. So the GOP gave them more money than the people keeping America alive, nourished, informed, warm &amp; connected.
1320825789504352256 2020-10-27 04:33:02 +0800 <sprbrighting> One unqualified justice swears in another. Why? Who really benefits?

1320790435258757120 2020-10-27 02:12:33 +0800 <sprbrighting> I think Trump is capable of always spotting the path that will pay him the most money without regard to how many people will suffer &amp; die or what damage it will do to this country.
1320790029715697664 2020-10-27 02:10:56 +0800 <sprbrighting> Good news.
1320785878680178689 2020-10-27 01:54:27 +0800 <sprbrighting> Why not provide housing?
1320779265294565377 2020-10-27 01:28:10 +0800 <sprbrighting> Pretty stupid, too.

1320765129370169344 2020-10-27 00:32:00 +0800 <sprbrighting> Go big.
1320764798758342660 2020-10-27 00:30:41 +0800 <sprbrighting> @donwinslow If a dog &amp; cat owner kept their animals in these conditions they’d be shut down by the very police who are caging these little kids &amp; the “owner” of the facility (Trump) would be in jail.
1320761565734342661 2020-10-27 00:17:50 +0800 <sprbrighting> How many billions of “emergency” tax dollars went to no-bid Trump/GOP supporter businesses? How much grift can this country sustain?

1320759253162864641 2020-10-27 00:08:39 +0800 <sprbrighting> @AriBerman @MrJonCryer Under Trump we’re living in Putin’s America: Political assassinations, hundreds of thousands dead or sickened by a preventable disease, millions out of work &amp; facing eviction, schools closed &amp; every day the stock market is being manipulated. Vote blue.
1320627140069523460 2020-10-26 15:23:40 +0800 <sprbrighting> Unforgivable.

1320564859260465152 2020-10-26 11:16:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> Text them to ask for a paper ballot they can hand mark, instead of WiFi connected hackable voting machine voting.
1320455394481766400 2020-10-26 04:01:13 +0800 <sprbrighting> @SpockResists Also a course in reading for rhetoric. Learn to spot empty words &amp; non promises, etc.
1320428306672406528 2020-10-26 02:13:35 +0800 <sprbrighting> @PinYoungActress @WeatherGeek68 So those nuns are now going to spread the virus?
1320418819010035714 2020-10-26 01:35:53 +0800 <sprbrighting> The FBI reported in 2006 that white supremacists had been quietly recruiting racists to police forces all over the country. Then they started giving them military equipment. What do you think they were up to?
1320409351857688576 2020-10-26 00:58:16 +0800 <sprbrighting> He was right when he predicted Trump would destroy the republicans if they nominated him, and they deserve to lose. We deserve to rid ourselves of the electoral college and become an actual democracy, too. Time.
1320207559911862272 2020-10-25 11:36:25 +0800 <sprbrighting> @emefinma @SpiroAgnewGhost High blood pressure?

1320186829631410176 2020-10-25 10:14:02 +0800 <sprbrighting> @NYCCouncil38 @NYPD76Pct Who is responsible for this theft.
1320168772116774912 2020-10-25 09:02:17 +0800 <sprbrighting> Since Barrett doesn’t even know the first Amendment protections of our rights, she is clearly not qualified to be on the Supreme Court.
1320077193624498176 2020-10-25 02:58:23 +0800 <sprbrighting> That is so funny. He’s been bitten by his own money monster.
1319847306049404929 2020-10-24 11:44:53 +0800 <sprbrighting> @KevinReuning Extortion?
1319845184012574726 2020-10-24 11:36:28 +0800 <sprbrighting> Death by abortion is exactly how it was for women before Roe v Wade was decided. Rich women left the country, poor women had back alley abortions &amp; many died or were so severely infected that they never could have more children.
1319844204676169728 2020-10-24 11:32:34 +0800 <sprbrighting> But will they follow the law &amp; do what the judge ordered?
1319843999398543360 2020-10-24 11:31:45 +0800 <sprbrighting> And he is succeeding.
1319843775686930433 2020-10-24 11:30:52 +0800 <sprbrighting> Yes. Hit retweet upper right to avoid leaving a comment.
1319777754804441088 2020-10-24 07:08:31 +0800 <sprbrighting> Lock him up.

1319776064038580224 2020-10-24 07:01:48 +0800 <sprbrighting> He’s obviously ill. Send the poor fellow home where he can recover.
1319749644834893827 2020-10-24 05:16:49 +0800 <sprbrighting> After he’d already been warned that an epidemic was coming.
1319749308376182784 2020-10-24 05:15:29 +0800 <sprbrighting> Sedona.
1319721496210632704 2020-10-24 03:24:58 +0800 <sprbrighting> It has happened.
1319720662634688512 2020-10-24 03:21:39 +0800 <sprbrighting> The only thing he’s correct about. Sure blew it on Coronavirus.
1319684530958000131 2020-10-24 00:58:05 +0800 <sprbrighting> Maybe McConnell was punching walls. They’re closing in.
1319679634854662144 2020-10-24 00:38:38 +0800 <sprbrighting> Plus deductibles, I imagine.
1319499478341013504 2020-10-23 12:42:45 +0800 <sprbrighting> Russia can change votes. We need to dump the voting machines &amp; use hand completed paper ballots.
1319468108365451264 2020-10-23 10:38:06 +0800 <sprbrighting> Lol

1319392336866988032 2020-10-23 05:37:00 +0800 <sprbrighting> Sick man, Kushner.
1319391629338312705 2020-10-23 05:34:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> Limited?
1319391557116592128 2020-10-23 05:33:54 +0800 <sprbrighting> I wonder if the software can be wiped with really strong magnets.
1319391152357830659 2020-10-23 05:32:18 +0800 <sprbrighting> The ghouly girls
1319381699118034950 2020-10-23 04:54:44 +0800 <sprbrighting> Law &amp; order ignored by the GOP once again.
1319376733213061120 2020-10-23 04:35:00 +0800 <sprbrighting> Nice talking Hallie. Don’t let this rude liar talk over you at all.
1319376277791371264 2020-10-23 04:33:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> So she’s found a way to make a buck off of Trump.
1319375251797643275 2020-10-23 04:29:07 +0800 <sprbrighting> After the Senate stops being controlled by the GOP those illegally confirmed judges can be removed from the bench.
1319374530440097792 2020-10-23 04:26:15 +0800 <sprbrighting> Trumps can’t stop accusing their opponents of every evil nasty thing Trumps have done themselves. But some people like Biden  are honorable &amp; honest.
1319370363931799553 2020-10-23 04:09:42 +0800 <sprbrighting> So sorry for your loss. Trump is missing key parts of what makes a man, including kindness, generosity, loyalty &amp; curiosity that drives you to improve yourself. He’s a minor personality and you are a hero. Thank you.
1319368731282137088 2020-10-23 04:03:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> When someone calls for an ambulance or because of a fire or an argument. We should send EMTs without police, firefighters without police, counselors without police. We should never jail someone who can’t pay a fine. Police should live in the community where they work.
1319368729717714946 2020-10-23 04:03:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> Defunding the police is far less than what we need to do. Police should be retrained to never shoot anyone in the back, never shoot anyone running away, never kick the feet out from under someone for arguing with them, which causes whiplash &amp; possible brain damage.
1319348021155356672 2020-10-23 02:40:55 +0800 <sprbrighting> All the children in this country are important to our future &amp; they should all be fed for free at school &amp; provided with meals when schools are closed.
1319345115203207173 2020-10-23 02:29:22 +0800 <sprbrighting> Beyond creepy.
1319176917283553280 2020-10-22 15:21:00 +0800 <sprbrighting> The minute he mentioned Trump as the victim, I wrote off every thing he ever utters as lying for Trump.
1319176439711764480 2020-10-22 15:19:06 +0800 <sprbrighting> Another failure by Trump.
1319121386795773954 2020-10-22 11:40:21 +0800 <sprbrighting> Worth reading. Barrett should decline the nomination.
1319120181243736065 2020-10-22 11:35:33 +0800 <sprbrighting> Good.
1319118156326039552 2020-10-22 11:27:31 +0800 <sprbrighting> People are donating whatever they can to send you home.
1319116747094454272 2020-10-22 11:21:55 +0800 <sprbrighting> Halleluah.
1319013704789209088 2020-10-22 04:32:27 +0800 <sprbrighting> It’s taking me to comment &amp; then I can retweet without commenting.
1319012501279789056 2020-10-22 04:27:41 +0800 <sprbrighting> McConnell fails the American people again.
1318953250033344513 2020-10-22 00:32:14 +0800 <sprbrighting> 8.3 billion is a slap on the wrist. Hundreds of thousands are dead, why wasn’t Purdue bankrupted for the many wrongful deaths they caused? America’s DOJ is a joke.
1318738013686386689 2020-10-21 10:16:58 +0800 <sprbrighting> Exactly.
1318737239359123456 2020-10-21 10:13:53 +0800 <sprbrighting> Or maybe GOP run states are not reporting deaths from CAoVZiD. Get the total deaths from all causes &amp; compare it to previous years to get a more accurate count of COVID deaths than is being reported.
1318676380154908672 2020-10-21 06:12:03 +0800 <sprbrighting> We have to keep police from arriving before or with ambulances. They interfere with emergency medical technicians. Police have no place in a medical emergency unless someone was stabbed or shot &amp; then they should stay out of the way of medical help.
1318667189902143488 2020-10-21 05:35:32 +0800 <sprbrighting> @jackfrombkln @Ikelaru All true &amp; absolutely correct. There was no concept of freedom in Europe prior to the discovery of the Americas. We got that from Native tribes.
1318647542515666945 2020-10-21 04:17:28 +0800 <sprbrighting> Lindsay obviously hasn’t bothered to read the Affordable Care Act. Ignorance is unacceptable in a Senator, as is lying to Americans.
1318647185353965569 2020-10-21 04:16:02 +0800 <sprbrighting> Then he’s just attempting to cheat workers, like Trump’s tax bill that only benefits the wealthy.
1318614489525153792 2020-10-21 02:06:07 +0800 <sprbrighting> Use a hand written paper ballot if you can. The machines are flipping Biden votes to Trump in Texas.
1318614260306579456 2020-10-21 02:05:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> There is no evidence that it is Hunter Biden’s laptop.
1318609487230427136 2020-10-21 01:46:14 +0800 <sprbrighting> Looked like more than 2 to me.
1318576983484235777 2020-10-20 23:37:05 +0800 <sprbrighting> Kiowa, Haida, Chippewa, Ute, Zuni, Mikmak, there are hundreds.
1318576583091761152 2020-10-20 23:35:30 +0800 <sprbrighting> Why not use plants or other growth vectors that don’t produce toxins or allergens that most humans react to negatively?  Many people are allergic to multiple pharmaceuticals because they use the same growth mediums. People who take them daily for years become allergic.
1318574344147070976 2020-10-20 23:26:36 +0800 <sprbrighting> Amazing.
1318569900718239744 2020-10-20 23:08:56 +0800 <sprbrighting> Nice idea, but the constitution reserves power over elections to the states. Federal control only exists if state laws violate the constitution, so the Supreme Court has final say over state elections laws. Which is why McConnell/GOP/Trump are stacking SCOTUS.
1318565424338923520 2020-10-20 22:51:09 +0800 <sprbrighting> About time.
1318562076353179649 2020-10-20 22:37:51 +0800 <sprbrighting> Oh God No! Texas has the most misogynist backward court system in the country. I don’t know what their criminal courts are like, but I’ll bet they’re the most prejudiced against minorities in America. It’s throwback country.
1318561352869236737 2020-10-20 22:34:58 +0800 <sprbrighting> Why isn’t she targeted now? Has the idiotic idea that a sitting president can’t be indicted now smeared over to coat his grown offspring with temporary immunity too?
1318559622869913601 2020-10-20 22:28:06 +0800 <sprbrighting> @ZemanLynnZ @madamecrab @JohnCornyn Yes, please tell us more about this #soldoutSenatorcornyn.
1318387757287309312 2020-10-20 11:05:10 +0800 <sprbrighting> Did Exxon make any donations to the GOP since Trump’s election?
1318379470751899649 2020-10-20 10:32:14 +0800 <sprbrighting> @AmyMcGrathKY I had to turn off Joy Reid when she harshly attack-questioned Amy McGrath about court stacking after the outrageous court stacking by McConnell &amp; Trump. Really inappropriate, as if McConnell isn’t the true target.
1318221665390583811 2020-10-20 00:05:11 +0800 <sprbrighting> @LeftyVegas Eat hunks of iceberg lettuce. It has a chemical that’s calming. And virtually no calories.
1318069751193632769 2020-10-19 14:01:31 +0800 <sprbrighting> There’s something seriously wrong with a person who refuses to wear a mask in your home.
1318024911860899845 2020-10-19 11:03:21 +0800 <sprbrighting> @thebobbyb @essenviews I have found that Trump supporters in my family &amp; my neighborhood can’t stop bringing it up, praising him or attacking Biden &amp; media.
1317950074819801088 2020-10-19 06:05:58 +0800 <sprbrighting> Eighty-six means throw them out, not kill them.
1317931599216869377 2020-10-19 04:52:33 +0800 <sprbrighting> Can you? I use them as a memory devise every month or two. I never get more than 49.
1317931141396004864 2020-10-19 04:50:44 +0800 <sprbrighting> @NWPinPDX And after he declares bankruptcy, having hidden any remaining assets, Trump whistles past his creditors fearing they will take revenge. Putin and a certain Saudi are watching. Has he paid them off in tanks, missiles, contracts, equipment?
1317893362444169216 2020-10-19 02:20:37 +0800 <sprbrighting> We should at least go back to the original populations to determine what the proportion of the population represented each Senate seat then, and adjust until we’re back at those ratios, not this insane imbalance between California &amp; Wyoming.
1317890783924531200 2020-10-19 02:10:22 +0800 <sprbrighting> Saw a voter report the voting machine in Texas changed her vote from Biden to Trump. Twice. She reported it &amp; they turned off that machine but how many others are switching Dem votes to GOP.
1317890346961887232 2020-10-19 02:08:38 +0800 <sprbrighting> Peeping Don.
1317855360045125632 2020-10-18 23:49:37 +0800 <sprbrighting> @AuthorKimberley Creepy as usual.
1317843669131522050 2020-10-18 23:03:09 +0800 <sprbrighting> And death or disability is more than an interruption in a life.
1317836981389307904 2020-10-18 22:36:35 +0800 <sprbrighting> After watching the horrible portrayal of Biden by Jim Carey, I’m boycotting SNL until after the election.
1317834026128875526 2020-10-18 22:24:50 +0800 <sprbrighting> Maybe the police will start thinking they’re endangering themselves by encouraging these chaps. They didn’t protect the legislature.
1317833425353494528 2020-10-18 22:22:27 +0800 <sprbrighting> 220,000 deaths are on Mueller’s head too.
1317655114144911360 2020-10-18 10:33:54 +0800 <sprbrighting> @orangepeel18 They helped trash America &amp; now they’re going to take off &amp; leave the liberals to clean up the mess? Do we really want them to have the right to come back after we fix it up?
1317654017997107201 2020-10-18 10:29:33 +0800 <sprbrighting> I don’t believe the subject has ever been briefed.
1317653473526124544 2020-10-18 10:27:23 +0800 <sprbrighting> So she equates being banned from twitter to having a gun to her head. A little over dramatic, isn’t that?
1317531074256281600 2020-10-18 02:21:01 +0800 <sprbrighting> They’ll find themselves vastly out numbered by trained military who are multi racial &amp; multi cultural &amp; armed with the best gear America can supply.  That’s why Trump has been deporting minorities who served this country in return for a path to citizenship.
1317529137746120704 2020-10-18 02:13:19 +0800 <sprbrighting> @peacelovingnj @BJHare Forgive them &amp; move on.
1317528350227755008 2020-10-18 02:10:11 +0800 <sprbrighting> Looks like a pack of Trump terrorists. #TrumpTerrorists

1317512013782732800 2020-10-18 01:05:16 +0800 <sprbrighting> John was a Democrat. If he returns it will be as a Democrat ready to kick GOP butt.
1317505762537525248 2020-10-18 00:40:26 +0800 <sprbrighting> The reason we controlled the airwaves is that we own them.   Billions were/are being made using our airwaves so we limited the number of ads, they had to be truthful, and none of these lying nasty Trump/GOP ads were allowed.   Good laws.
1317503648159592450 2020-10-18 00:32:02 +0800 <sprbrighting> @BPPubs @105KaySt @jennycohn1 @sarahkendzior True. I remember the rush of the adults to get ready to watch the 6 o’clock news. There was no talking or fooling around for an hour every night.
1317502591782199296 2020-10-18 00:27:50 +0800 <sprbrighting> Fox News is technically &amp; legally only entertainment. It’s Not News. Reagan &amp; the anti-democracy republicans killed it. We can never let them control any part of our airwaves again.
1317501445915045889 2020-10-18 00:23:17 +0800 <sprbrighting> My half Irish friend tells me he feels safer here because although he doesn’t now have an Irish passport he can get one due to his Irish heritage &amp; move back if he gets the urge.
1317498184797614080 2020-10-18 00:10:19 +0800 <sprbrighting> @makinggardens My Lhasas dug up &amp; ate every one of my carrots!
1317495982309830657 2020-10-18 00:01:34 +0800 <sprbrighting> @thebr0keb0i You mean blubber like baby Kavanaugh?
1317325324011544576 2020-10-17 12:43:26 +0800 <sprbrighting> @thomaskaine5 Already dropped it in the official drop box.
1317322929583972353 2020-10-17 12:33:55 +0800 <sprbrighting> Take Benadryl if you have it. Go to hospital if you get shortness of breath.
1317317408814637056 2020-10-17 12:11:59 +0800 <sprbrighting> Release the victims of ICE &amp; order the children to be reunited with their parents.
1317269794916163586 2020-10-17 09:02:47 +0800 <sprbrighting> @I_amBlueJay Ooh. Blood on the Tracks!
1317253028924190720 2020-10-17 07:56:10 +0800 <sprbrighting> My brother-in-law just passed away after a long battle with cancer. They lived in Hawaii so we can’t even go to help because of Trump’s failure to battle against COVID. America will be mourning-in-absentia for decades after Trump is gone.
1317240354270187521 2020-10-17 07:05:48 +0800 <sprbrighting> @thebr0keb0i Most of us are on to that now.
1317240113181597696 2020-10-17 07:04:50 +0800 <sprbrighting> @RBReich We need new legislatures in every state &amp; the federal government, and new judges, attorneys general, police chiefs &amp; sheriffs.
1317192281732960256 2020-10-17 03:54:46 +0800 <sprbrighting> @donwinslow Me too. This is a labor of honor.
1317191883584536577 2020-10-17 03:53:11 +0800 <sprbrighting> @nazuzuwin No. But it might make him sleepier, less depressed. Used topically It’s helped 2 friends with arthritis in their hands &amp; one with leg cramps.
1317185848228552705 2020-10-17 03:29:13 +0800 <sprbrighting> @mkraju Haha haha
1317152935449485313 2020-10-17 01:18:25 +0800 <sprbrighting> If 20 percent COVID patients suffer disabling lung, heart or kidney damage then we already have 1,400,000 permanently disabled people.   Herd immunity will  cripple us for a generation. No wonder Putin wants us to not wear masks. He’s conquered us without firing a shot.
1317149880050098176 2020-10-17 01:06:17 +0800 <sprbrighting> @ReesusP @BudGothmog44 @mercedesschlapp @JoeBiden @ABCPolitics Fascinating.
1317147327551864832 2020-10-17 00:56:08 +0800 <sprbrighting> @essenviews By eliminating the Payroll ta, which funds it.
1316930199066451974 2020-10-16 10:33:21 +0800 <sprbrighting> An essential worker is being turned over to ICE for the 3rd time for arguing with his son. He’s a Marine, fought for America, is here legally, married to an American &amp; takes care of a severely disabled elderly man who will have to go into nursing care. Vote blue.
1316844788558118912 2020-10-16 04:53:58 +0800 <sprbrighting> @griff_989 @LarryBoorstein @MeidasTouch You get whatever they think you deserve.   Nothing law &amp; order about Trump &amp; the GOP &amp; everyone who follows their evil lead.
1316841017606242304 2020-10-16 04:38:58 +0800 <sprbrighting> Excellent.
1316840146721931264 2020-10-16 04:35:31 +0800 <sprbrighting> @WhiteRabbitMama I make movies against the religious attacks on LGBTQ. There’s one on YouTube called Abomination Cafe.  There are 600+ Abominations &amp; commandments in the Bible, everything from not mixing wool &amp; linen in cloth to not culling your fields. Feed the poor.
1316838889206628352 2020-10-16 04:30:31 +0800 <sprbrighting> @KatInouye It’s magical.
1316837592797569024 2020-10-16 04:25:22 +0800 <sprbrighting> Me too. It’s great in all sweets. I can use a little less sugar.
1316836019413499905 2020-10-16 04:19:07 +0800 <sprbrighting> Cardamon is very nice in all sweet breads.
1316832905092448256 2020-10-16 04:06:44 +0800 <sprbrighting> @Acyn What is he talking about? Who?
1316822701764345861 2020-10-16 03:26:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> No one can know when they may have to deal with the medical community. Glad to know you’re well now.
1316818937464590336 2020-10-16 03:11:14 +0800 <sprbrighting> They also harped on Hillary’s emails while ignoring the child rape accusations against Trump. They didn’t cover Trump’s University frauds or the theft of money from their foundations. We need to end media domination by billionaires &amp; corporations.
1316818249212805120 2020-10-16 03:08:30 +0800 <sprbrighting> @MaryanneChisho2 We are anxious to receive the portrait of John Tonemah we ordered. Hope you are still well. 🤷🏼‍♀️😀
1316766692412854272 2020-10-15 23:43:38 +0800 <sprbrighting> What more do we know about Trump’s Taxes?
1316762292826980357 2020-10-15 23:26:09 +0800 <sprbrighting> Another known liar for Trump. We’ll be rid of her when Trump loses this election.
1316530511095889920 2020-10-15 08:05:08 +0800 <sprbrighting> @dontlickchalk Yes. I will make comedies &amp; write poetry &amp; paint gorgeous images of beautiful Sedona.
1316511535179603968 2020-10-15 06:49:44 +0800 <sprbrighting> I can name them. Why can’t she? She didn’t know the basic rule of law, that it’s illegal to attempt to intimidate voters.
1316509100377665536 2020-10-15 06:40:03 +0800 <sprbrighting> Wash it with strong white vinegar. It kills mildew.
1316503680309366784 2020-10-15 06:18:31 +0800 <sprbrighting> @AblueUs Arizona!
1316413576903487488 2020-10-15 00:20:29 +0800 <sprbrighting> Children are one major vector of COVID spread. Every school teacher knows that classrooms are the hub of spread of every virus that arises. Many stop teaching because they can’t face another cold &amp; flu season. That’s why we can’t open the schools yet.
1316407453110595589 2020-10-14 23:56:09 +0800 <sprbrighting> Has anyone got video of Cruz questioning a male nominee about his kids like this? Very sexist.
1316407194045145089 2020-10-14 23:55:07 +0800 <sprbrighting> The coronavirus didn’t exist when that photo was taken.
1316405756338434050 2020-10-14 23:49:24 +0800 <sprbrighting> Assault. He should be arrested for that.
1316402561893584899 2020-10-14 23:36:42 +0800 <sprbrighting> They will probably toss the Biden ballots &amp; fill in any empty check boxes with the GOP candidate before putting it in a real drop box. Crooks &amp; liars are all the GOP has now.
1316215171921006593 2020-10-14 11:12:05 +0800 <sprbrighting> @markknoller Trump’s lips are looking kinda blue.
1316213251449917440 2020-10-14 11:04:27 +0800 <sprbrighting> Her cult requires women to be the pawns of their husbands, conveniently forgetting that the Bible requires husbands to also submit to their wives as well as wives submitting to their husbands.
1316167714059153410 2020-10-14 08:03:30 +0800 <sprbrighting> DOJ has no standing to do anything for Melania.
1316166666116423680 2020-10-14 07:59:21 +0800 <sprbrighting> Sorry Supremes, he expects a big payoff from his appointees.
1316165095597064195 2020-10-14 07:53:06 +0800 <sprbrighting> Just voted. No GOP fake ballot boxes in sight &amp; no lines here in Northern AZ.
1316075489585319936 2020-10-14 01:57:02 +0800 <sprbrighting> @clairecmc Citizens United dark money in politics seems to be backfiring on the rich.   The people are voting with lunch money, vacation money, coffee splurge money. They’re outspending the Oligarchs. The Bill of Rights may yet survive Trump &amp; the GOP.
1316073014895669248 2020-10-14 01:47:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> Since when do we question a nominee for the Supreme Court on whether she plays a musical instrument? I’ve never heard of questions like that during a confirmation hearing. We’re in a health &amp; economic crisis &amp; they’re wasting Senate time on this crap. I am sickened again.
1316071928700960768 2020-10-14 01:42:53 +0800 <sprbrighting> Watching Cruddy Cruz flap his lips. He thinks there are only Ten Commandments. Actually there are over 610 commandments &amp; abominations, including leaving crops in your field for the poor, feeding &amp; sheltering strangers, widows, orphans.
1316068476620992513 2020-10-14 01:29:10 +0800 <sprbrighting> I don’t want religious nuts gutting the Bill of a Rights, do you? They’ve already targeted minorities &amp; religions they don’t like with wrongful criminal attacks by police, unequal criminal persecution &amp; our horrific wrongful incarceration industry. Vote blue.
1316068475098423297 2020-10-14 01:29:10 +0800 <sprbrighting> Amy Barrett wants to toss parts of our Bill of Rights that she doesn’t like. She thinks she’s better than our founding fathers. They put our rights in the order they liked. Freedom of the Press. Free speech. Free to protest government wrongs like police killings.
1315714072881459200 2020-10-13 02:00:54 +0800 <sprbrighting> Ask for a paper ballot. Those voting machines may switch your vote.
1315692833894932481 2020-10-13 00:36:30 +0800 <sprbrighting> Not under the Bill Barr department of Justice Denied!
1315527739294642176 2020-10-12 13:40:29 +0800 <sprbrighting> It can all be back to profitable in 4 to 8 weeks of mandatory masks &amp; shut down. And there will be a vaccine next year sometime. The evictions that are coming, the foreclosures are terrifying right now.
1315513776536395776 2020-10-12 12:45:00 +0800 <sprbrighting> I guess I have to burn my red Stetson.
1315360775129554944 2020-10-12 02:37:01 +0800 <sprbrighting> Dems need to really clean out the swamp the GOP has made of our federal courts, including SCOTUS. Whatever it takes.
1315358449488674816 2020-10-12 02:27:47 +0800 <sprbrighting> Reading about this trespass, vandalism &amp; threats by a MAGA neighbor ignored by local sheriffs. Request a restraining order from local court.   Report directly to the FBI which is tracking &amp; indicting terrorists  like this MAGA &amp; other terrorist groups.
1315328610224410625 2020-10-12 00:29:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> Tell them you’re a republican. No need to tell bullies the truth.
1315327413560066049 2020-10-12 00:24:27 +0800 <sprbrighting> @politvidchannel Remember the mean pouts he &amp; Melania displayed during the inaugural celebrations after he was sworn in? We want adults who care about the American people in charge from now on,  No more tantrum throwers in Our WH,
1315326382629560320 2020-10-12 00:20:21 +0800 <sprbrighting> Next week it’ll be over 100 in Phoenix again. Another record heat wave as we near Halloween. California is still burning while The Gulf states are drowning from hurricanes and Coronavirus.  But Trump &amp; the GOP insist there’s no global warming.  Vote blue.
1315115734570164224 2020-10-11 10:23:19 +0800 <sprbrighting> @lawrencehurley @smartdissent We need to go back to 60 votes requirement for judges after we get rid of all the unqualified Trump/GOP ominess.
1314997095892361216 2020-10-11 02:31:53 +0800 <sprbrighting> @atdavidhoffman A lot of them may really need the money Trump routinely pays “actors” to appear with signs &amp; hats at his rallies.
1314992438323245057 2020-10-11 02:13:23 +0800 <sprbrighting> @Dystopian_Rob Don’t want to call them names.
1314988365658296320 2020-10-11 01:57:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> @justinhendrix Thank you.
1314965541501591553 2020-10-11 00:26:30 +0800 <sprbrighting> @parodyislegal @msnaydani Trump says he played tennis with Jeff Epstein this morning. He seems to have met with Herman Cain too.  When my elderly relatives start talking to deceased family &amp; friends, it’s always meant they were dying themselves. Always.
1314959722475261952 2020-10-11 00:03:23 +0800 <sprbrighting> Is, not s. Need glasses to tweet.
1314959488672178176 2020-10-11 00:02:27 +0800 <sprbrighting> @WSJCustom We don’t want wealth. That craziness s dying. We want fairness &amp; community.
1314805826461130752 2020-10-10 13:51:51 +0800 <sprbrighting> @varindersingh24 To drop my dog at the vet today. He😀is fine.
1314804404046815232 2020-10-10 13:46:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> Pass state &amp; personal financial relief for COVID victims.
1314598349438242816 2020-10-10 00:07:25 +0800 <sprbrighting> Example: False accusers of child sex trafficking in pizza parlor basements should immediately face criminal prosecution &amp; civil summary judgements. We have to restrict media ownership so there are no virtual monopolies on our news services.
1314435689795084288 2020-10-09 13:21:04 +0800 <sprbrighting> @rickferguson72 Dirt brown.
1314354550342479872 2020-10-09 07:58:38 +0800 <sprbrighting> When the police allowed the armed creeps to invade the legislature, they gave permission for these thugs to kidnap the governor &amp; any other citizen they choose to attack. Thank god the FBI is upholding our laws because local police seems to feel they are free to ignore it.
1314350038881984512 2020-10-09 07:40:43 +0800 <sprbrighting> I think they think they own women, like they think they own their cats.
1314273824750231552 2020-10-09 02:37:52 +0800 <sprbrighting> @Bahabris Thank you. I wrote this when he got the nomination. I was so mad, blistering.
1314272720964657152 2020-10-09 02:33:29 +0800 <sprbrighting> @funder This made me laugh out loud.
1314270263123472384 2020-10-09 02:23:43 +0800 <sprbrighting> @robreiner Read my poem about Trump. You’ll love it.
1314268391100694530 2020-10-09 02:16:17 +0800 <sprbrighting> Wrote this about Trump and thought resisters would enjoy.  https://t.co/4ueUPivl0b
1314267396413165568 2020-10-09 02:12:19 +0800 <sprbrighting> Found this poem I wrote about Trump. Enjoy.  https://t.co/AiCAF6gBZo
1314263535011065857 2020-10-09 01:56:59 +0800 <sprbrighting> Seeking technical help. I wrote a piece about Trump when he first was nominated. I’d like to post without retyping the whole thing. Can anyone explain how to upload it to twitter. I know I can take a picture but the print is too small.
1314226568114270210 2020-10-08 23:30:05 +0800 <sprbrighting> They’re already here marching into legislative offices, setting businesses on fire &amp; harassing minorities. They call themselves Boogaloo &amp; Proud boys.
1314055838940590080 2020-10-08 12:11:40 +0800 <sprbrighting> @DaxGigandet Clueless.
1314052925061165056 2020-10-08 12:00:05 +0800 <sprbrighting> @SarahMLenti @realDonaldTrump We paid thousands more because we could no longer deduct state property taxes.
1314051665016758275 2020-10-08 11:55:05 +0800 <sprbrighting> @MaryanneChisho2 Lol. Very well put.
1313971966743724032 2020-10-08 06:38:23 +0800 <sprbrighting> @KaivanShroff They should send them anyway. Nobody in the Trump administration honors Court subpoenas &amp; court orders to stop separating kids from their parents have been ignored, so why should dems follow court orders not to give voters the ability to vote safely.
1313913273704611840 2020-10-08 02:45:10 +0800 <sprbrighting> @BettyB919 Or they sold out to the fossil fuel industries.
1313867038805299202 2020-10-07 23:41:27 +0800 <sprbrighting> @Lee_in_Iowa @DrBiden The taxpayers paid for the invention &amp; creation of the internet. We should not have allowed anyone to charge us for access to it or to use it to gather information about us that can be used to manipulate, cheat &amp; steal from us.
1313863969577349120 2020-10-07 23:29:15 +0800 <sprbrighting> Request a paper ballot, hand mark it &amp; drop it in the collection box or take it to your polling place. Do not use voting machines. They can easily be hacked to change your vote. Mark each candidate separately to make it harder to flip your votes.
1313863193781915648 2020-10-07 23:26:10 +0800 <sprbrighting> @MaryLTrump Watching helplessly as the government separates babies from their moms &amp; sticks them in ice cold cages is torture, too. None of us should be that helpless against a group of evil tyrants ever again.
1313860148956282880 2020-10-07 23:14:04 +0800 <sprbrighting> @DearAuntCrabby I am of the opinion that if you supported Trump you should never trust yourself to vote again.
1313850488073285637 2020-10-07 22:35:41 +0800 <sprbrighting> @romyreiner @robreiner I prefer not to tie up our lives and the courts prosecuting these grifters. Just confiscate every dollar, every plane &amp; diamond &amp; penthouse &amp; cut off access to media. Jail them. Then go after the Mercer’s, Koch’s, hedge fund thieves, billionaire money hoarders &amp; GOP traitors.
1313848091141828610 2020-10-07 22:26:09 +0800 <sprbrighting> @DrDenaGrayson @robreiner @CDCgov @KamalaHarris Great display. Wonder how many more are infected.
1313641554968420352 2020-10-07 08:45:27 +0800 <sprbrighting> This is just as true for native Americans. A far higher per capita percentage serve in the armed forces and they do not have loyalty to another country from since their ancestors were here at least 14,000 years and possibly as long as 150,000 years ago.
1313632250802532352 2020-10-07 08:08:29 +0800 <sprbrighting> @USRealityCheck Herman Cain died more than 30 days after positive test.
1313619589817720833 2020-10-07 07:18:10 +0800 <sprbrighting> True.

1313545874526466048 2020-10-07 02:25:15 +0800 <sprbrighting> I understand medical procedures use stem cells from placentas &amp; umbilical cords after babies are born, not from embryos. Relax.

1313539441248530432 2020-10-07 01:59:41 +0800 <sprbrighting> Trump may be on a ventilator by the VP debate, so Pence may be President. Wait &amp; see.
1312880381293588480 2020-10-05 06:20:49 +0800 <sprbrighting> Ice packs, CBD oil as liniment, rest, over the counter lidocaine patches, great for any sprain.
1312876120346292224 2020-10-05 06:03:53 +0800 <sprbrighting> My guess is the Trump’s knew Trump was sick &amp; wanted to infect Biden because they knew he would win if he is well. Otherwise why did they arrive late &amp; avoid being tested?
1312823026921005056 2020-10-05 02:32:55 +0800 <sprbrighting> I wouldn’t stay with someone who treated me like that. It’s passive aggressive &amp; just plain mean.

1312811331213381632 2020-10-05 01:46:26 +0800 <sprbrighting> How does that square with denying affordable medical care once you exit the womb? None of this is anywhere in the Bible. Nothing about abortion, nothing about denying healthcare. I don’t think suicide is even one of the abominations, like eating shellfish or pork.
1312809751122571264 2020-10-05 01:40:10 +0800 <sprbrighting> @HollysHooman @brianefallon What did they intend this to mean?
1312764331906359298 2020-10-04 22:39:41 +0800 <sprbrighting> Legally an impeached president can’t pardon his minions or commute their sentences either. Perhaps when the democrats are back in control they will undo these unconstitutionally employed judges &amp; overturn the wrongful pardons &amp; commutations.

1312423163167272960 2020-10-04 00:04:00 +0800 <sprbrighting> Would you feel sorry for Hitler &amp; NAZI cultists after they’d only killed 200,000 Americans &amp; only sickened 7 million of us? Save your sympathy for those who have no healthcare, no income, are mourning because Trump let people in blue states die.
1312421834332094467 2020-10-03 23:58:43 +0800 <sprbrighting> Only a saintly person could overlook the hate mongering, cheating, hubris saturated, misery spreading by the  current crop of GOP jerks and the hard earned misery they are about to suffer from the virus that couldn’t care less what they think.
1312421833510023168 2020-10-03 23:58:43 +0800 <sprbrighting> Block others from having any say or participation in our dying democracy, refuse to provide the most basic protective masks &amp; gloves to the healthcare workers, clerks &amp; delivery people who risk their lives to keep Americans fed &amp; supplied with essentials.
1312421832708947970 2020-10-03 23:58:43 +0800 <sprbrighting> Healthcare to fellow human beings, force their religious beliefs on others, hoard billions of dollars they will never need while their employees go hungry or have to beg for government handouts, refuse to protect themselves &amp; others by keeping their spittle contained by a mask.
1312421831693885446 2020-10-03 23:58:42 +0800 <sprbrighting> I find it extremely difficult to be kind &amp; gentle to people who approve of caging children, stealing children from their families for god know what evil intent, preferring that women die in childbirth than have good birth control, failure to prosecute child rapists, deny

1312182768026095616 2020-10-03 08:08:45 +0800 <sprbrighting> Fox entertainment “news” has no standing to call for anything. Biden needs to continue full speed ahead in his quest to save American democracy.
1312181578185883648 2020-10-03 08:04:02 +0800 <sprbrighting> Biden should press forward with every ad &amp; every antiTrump statement. Trump has earned no quarter, nor has he properly protected himself or the American people from this deadly debilitating virus.
1312181018783174656 2020-10-03 08:01:48 +0800 <sprbrighting> They better have proof positive before accusing people of being violators of anything. Imagine the billions in reparations we may have to pay for this further irresponsible baloney from ICE. Imagine the vigilantes attacking people they think resemble the people on the billboards.

1312171509440417794 2020-10-03 07:24:01 +0800 <sprbrighting> @byKateSmith This is one reason ACA s key. It includes birth control and bans discrimination against women, who used to be charged more than men whether or not they were of child birthing age and even though they had less heart disease &amp; better over all health than men of the same age.

That’s it for me. You’re a Trump enabler and should stand down &amp; get off MSNBC.  You’re responsible for thousands of American COVID deaths.

The black lives matter protestors are not antifa, although they are probably against fascism, therefore they are antifascism.

1311001928470388736 2020-09-30 01:56:31 +0800 <sprbrighting> While we’re examining Trump’s tax schemes, take a long look at Bain Capital &amp; the other major players who avoid all taxes through idiotic laws our GOP government enacted to benefit them.   Tax laws must be gutted &amp; new simple ones enacted without business deductions.
1311000904334671872 2020-09-30 01:52:27 +0800 <sprbrighting> Exactly. The IRS has been gutted. Collections have been farmed out to often unscrupulous private collection agencies who harass &amp; intimidate lower income tax payers which collect monies that are not legally owed &amp; couldn’t be legally collected by the IRS.   It’s a huge scam.
1310997006844796928 2020-09-30 01:36:58 +0800 <sprbrighting> Since she is utterly controlled by her cult &amp; her husband, you need to test them too. And we don’t have the ability to do that.
1310996579944263680 2020-09-30 01:35:16 +0800 <sprbrighting> Remember, the Supreme Court doesn’t write the laws, it interprets them &amp; determines whether or no they violate the Constitution.   State  &amp; local legislatures and Federal Congress members &amp; Senators write the laws.  Run your state. Vote blue for Every Office &amp; Judge.
1310995709462634496 2020-09-30 01:31:48 +0800 <sprbrighting> What most terrifies me about Trump is that he has dragged his followers down to his level.
1310990522933063686 2020-09-30 01:11:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> Trump🤪 projecting again.   Guess those strange shiny patches we saw on his head a few months ago are implants his master is using to feed him his lines.
1310989982383783937 2020-09-30 01:09:03 +0800 <sprbrighting> And Trump seems to have roused the same hatred in his minions and he has aimed that hatred at everyone who disagrees with him or them. Scary.
1310722545587347456 2020-09-29 07:26:21 +0800 <sprbrighting> I bet some collection agency is trying to defraud you. Call the bar association for a referral.
1310660291131138048 2020-09-29 03:18:58 +0800 <sprbrighting> The mainstream media drove Trump into office with their constant coverage of every second of his rallies &amp; harping on Hillary’s emails, the only possible thing they could use to attack her.

1310609020823109633 2020-09-28 23:55:15 +0800 <sprbrighting> Trump will do anything to win. Anything but tell the truth, Anything but provide good healthcare, Anything but stop a deadly pandemic,  Anything but let us vote, Anything but pay his taxes, Anything but protect our courts.
1310607267520065536 2020-09-28 23:48:17 +0800 <sprbrighting> Remember when Trump asked black voters “What have you got to lose?” Turns out it was:  jobs,  businesses,  kids educations,  Their lives to COVID   And their right to vote.

1310256293777563650 2020-09-28 00:33:38 +0800 <sprbrighting> Since Trump is not a doctor or medical professional, isn’t it curious that he knows so much about performance enhancing drugs that he feels safe libeling Joe Biden with false accusations of drug use? Many people say Trump is addicted to adderall, a performance enhancing drug.

1309911299850084353 2020-09-27 01:42:45 +0800 <sprbrighting> I have read that some machines turned straight ticket votes from dem to republican in the 2016 election. Best to vote each individual separately. It’s harder to electronically hack &amp; flip the votes.
1309593150952931328 2020-09-26 04:38:32 +0800 <sprbrighting> @josh_icloud @VoteMarsha @Hallerin Wow. People in Tennessee need to know how their senator has been bought by opioid manufacturers.
1309582257196273666 2020-09-26 03:55:15 +0800 <sprbrighting> More like “Let’s agree not to punish me for robbing you”.
1309564974751121409 2020-09-26 02:46:35 +0800 <sprbrighting> No. We need to tell the truth. If that requires harsh language, 200,000 are dead. That’s the harshest reality you will ever find.
1309308944251121666 2020-09-25 09:49:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> For thousands of years people peeled potatoes because the skins are full of a chemical like soap. It gives you gut pain, diarrhea, symptoms of several now common digestive illnesses that are very common now but used to be very rare before we started eating potato skin.
1309306302032535552 2020-09-25 09:38:42 +0800 <sprbrighting> I’ll bet it’s seventy plus percent.
1309303496517103616 2020-09-25 09:27:33 +0800 <sprbrighting> Well why don’t you &amp; chicken little Trump get the Post Master to put the mail sorting machines back &amp; go back to efficiently handling our mail, including ballots?
1309230825670496257 2020-09-25 04:38:47 +0800 <sprbrighting> He looks defeated, but he’s still the most dangerous American in history.
1309230070309953536 2020-09-25 04:35:47 +0800 <sprbrighting> Vote for each candidate separately rather than the option to vote a straight party ticket. It was reported after 2016 that straight dem ballots were recorded as straight GOP on some voting machines. Use a paper ballot, hand marked &amp; follow Jennifer Cohn.
1309228797254750208 2020-09-25 04:30:44 +0800 <sprbrighting> Perjury?
1309228696075563009 2020-09-25 04:30:20 +0800 <sprbrighting> Such a good question.
1309228571085340677 2020-09-25 04:29:50 +0800 <sprbrighting> He is ignoring the GOP wrongful purges of voter registrations &amp; error filled voter rolls used to deny people the vote.
1309227695834718208 2020-09-25 04:26:21 +0800 <sprbrighting> That smoke definitely would increase deaths, but add COVID &amp; they could really spike. Much harder to know what the cause of death is there.
1309201693628706816 2020-09-25 02:43:02 +0800 <sprbrighting> Not Congress, the Senate. The house passed stimulus months ago but McConnell is blocking a vote on it in the Senate. Vote out McConnell.
1309161133287251968 2020-09-25 00:01:51 +0800 <sprbrighting> If Biden wins he’ll be inaugurated whether Trump leaves peacefully or not. He’ll then take over control whether he’s in the WH or not. Trump will be removed from the WH by the very secret service he has exposed to CV19 over &amp; over for rallies &amp; has bullied mercilessly.
1309154207400964102 2020-09-24 23:34:20 +0800 <sprbrighting> It takes 2/3rds of the Senate to remove a president through impeachment.
1308949103917764608 2020-09-24 09:59:20 +0800 <sprbrighting> So women shouldn’t marry men if this lady gets to be a Justice. Maybe get that divorce now if you don’t want to be ruled over by a husband.   What will that do to the wedding industry &amp; travel/catering/hotels?   Gay marriage is fine, for you LGBTQ folks.
1308916262114820096 2020-09-24 07:48:50 +0800 <sprbrighting> This is not an incentive to vote, it’s a possibility to vote, a chance the republican legislature in Florida have wrongfully denied although the voters of the state wanted all felons who have served their time to be able to vote.
1308907188052729857 2020-09-24 07:12:46 +0800 <sprbrighting> Trump is really committed to revenge &amp; he considers the presidency belongs to him so he gets to take revenge on it &amp; everyone in it if he loses it. Wonder if he has already planned his final attack.
1308901877925449728 2020-09-24 06:51:40 +0800 <sprbrighting> They must have just released a captive bird for her to get this shot timed so bloody perfectly.
1308901120027308035 2020-09-24 06:48:39 +0800 <sprbrighting> One hopes they’re under strict mask wearing home quarantine.
1308898947293949957 2020-09-24 06:40:01 +0800 <sprbrighting> Armed thugs attacking Americans exercising their first amendment rights. We must stop funding these attacks on ourselves by police. They’re friends to the Boogaloo Boys &amp; other white male racists. Read the FBI report on police racism from 2006.
1308872999144230912 2020-09-24 04:56:55 +0800 <sprbrighting> We could just remove Kavanaugh &amp; there would still be a quorum &amp; an never number for a decision on an election.
1308860739445231616 2020-09-24 04:08:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> @CharlesMBlow @rmsalerno1 Black women, Native American women, Hispanic women, all women need to join together to stop Trump.
1308853451812753422 2020-09-24 03:39:14 +0800 <sprbrighting> I think soon we have to just stop. Just stop. Full stop on everything. No working, no buying, just day to day survival. There is no economy, there is no America without working people.
1308839699994365952 2020-09-24 02:44:36 +0800 <sprbrighting> Neither side is as all-or-nothing as you suggest. No one is rabble rousing the left like Trump is driving his minions to violence, panic and blind anger at strangers.  https://t.co/IJrs9LKtj4
1308835248877326338 2020-09-24 02:26:54 +0800 <sprbrighting> @SethAbramson If The election doesn’t give Trump the presidency, then his term ends on January 20th and Nancy Pelosi becomes president. [Bush only won because of that men-in-suits invasion of the Florida vote tally &amp; the Supreme Court intervention.]
1308816024104398848 2020-09-24 01:10:31 +0800 <sprbrighting> Finish you run near her. Ask her if she wants to go for a walk with you while you cool down. Tell her her smile makes your run better every time you see her.
1308810468547424261 2020-09-24 00:48:26 +0800 <sprbrighting> @jette2019 @Yemayah777 Trump probably thinks he can snort enough “enhancing” drugs and brain supplements himself to pull off the debates. Everyone else with a functioning brain has earned the right to be way into the tranquilizers.
1308551302092173312 2020-09-23 07:38:36 +0800 <sprbrighting> Imagine the pentagon quietly causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans. For profit. And it isn’t even a hot war.
1308521238940192769 2020-09-23 05:39:09 +0800 <sprbrighting> @juliaclarktor @BevDiane Add some abominations since Trump is flashing the Bible. I’ll start: 1. Bearing False Witness 2. Lying 3. Adultery 4. Coveting another man’s wife, etc 5. Taking the Lord’s name in vain  Feel free to contribute.
1308222334113689600 2020-09-22 09:51:24 +0800 <sprbrighting> Indict Trump’s kids who were involved in the charity rip off now. Get voters’ attention, please.
1308209725234753537 2020-09-22 09:01:18 +0800 <sprbrighting> 200,000 dead Americans &amp; Tucker Carlson thinks this is not a life &amp; death election.
1308109214653378560 2020-09-22 02:21:54 +0800 <sprbrighting> COVID will bankrupt “for profit healthcare” even if coverage of pre-existing conditions is killed by the Trump/GOP.   40% of asymptomatic COVID victims have heart inflammation. Others have lung damage. If Health insurers drop &gt;40% of their customers, they’ll go broke.
1307898313950130179 2020-09-21 12:23:52 +0800 <sprbrighting> The dems need to remove all unqualified judges &amp; all Trump nominees if it is proved that he did not actually wing the 2016 election, but that the voting machines were hacked to change votes.
1307865903694897153 2020-09-21 10:15:05 +0800 <sprbrighting> Completely false. My taxes went up because I could no longer deduct property taxes. They went up for everyone I know.
1307742596836417536 2020-09-21 02:05:06 +0800 <sprbrighting> @axios @minnnyme Do it, please, Madam Speaker!
1307716255554568194 2020-09-21 00:20:26 +0800 <sprbrighting> @DearAuntCrabby It’s a feint. I bet it all goes to a hand picked no-bid buddy that doesn’t even have employees and no benefits ever go to Puerto Rico.
1307715637200871424 2020-09-21 00:17:58 +0800 <sprbrighting> Why isn’t congress using it’s power to arrest when Trump’s spawn and his appointees fail to comply with a subpoena? Why doesn’t Roger Stone have limits on his ability to assist Trump in cheating to another presidential win?
1307714569523965952 2020-09-21 00:13:44 +0800 <sprbrighting> @MaryanneChisho2 Praying it’s just the flu.
1307470309948178432 2020-09-20 08:03:08 +0800 <sprbrighting> And photograph your paper ballot after you mark it before it’s scanned.
1307468340370137090 2020-09-20 07:55:18 +0800 <sprbrighting> Biden needs to seat all the women who accused Trump of sexual assault in the front row &amp; all the veterans he cheated with his phony university in the second to last rows.
1307356678967287809 2020-09-20 00:31:36 +0800 <sprbrighting> @SusanSolomon @senatemajldr Trump can still have his nominee confirmed to SCOTUS after the election &amp; before Biden is inaugurated.

1306352247924613120 2020-09-17 06:00:21 +0800 <sprbrighting> @DoctorHenryCT I predicted Stone was being freed to work on Trump’s campaign. He’s the intimate dirty trickster.
1306350970738110464 2020-09-17 05:55:16 +0800 <sprbrighting> @mortisnoctu @5_2blue Most of the forests are federal land. The federal government controlled by republicans through the senate has permitted America to go up in flames, has permitted hundreds of thousands of us to die in agony, has bankrupted America.
1306346356529704961 2020-09-17 05:36:56 +0800 <sprbrighting> @travisakers I really think this should wait until after the election.

1305934995526053888 2020-09-16 02:22:20 +0800 <sprbrighting> Sorry that happened. Make costumes, make black cats &amp; pumpkin decorations &amp; cupcakes together. It’s Good to do things yourselves together instead of buying costumes &amp; trick or treating for commercial sweets.
1305923355422330880 2020-09-16 01:36:05 +0800 <sprbrighting> @jsloggans3 Yes.
1305618211577061377 2020-09-15 05:23:33 +0800 <sprbrighting> @MaxNordau @NastyHearse Time to make it permanent status then.
1305617970421358592 2020-09-15 05:22:36 +0800 <sprbrighting> Unless you’re a billionaire like Murdoch or an Einstein like Melania it takes at least 10 years and many were young children. It’s also quite expensive, requires attorneys &amp; you must pass FBI background check &amp; a civics test, unlike Trump &amp; his cabinet.
1305530851401166848 2020-09-14 23:36:25 +0800 <sprbrighting> @PaulaOr10498972 @MedicVet68 Court has already ruled this illegal/unenforceable.

1305183808338055168 2020-09-14 00:37:23 +0800 <sprbrighting> @ALOTdotcom Why does this company think it is ok to defame boomers? Ageism? Laziness? Easy targets who probably won’t see what they’re saying?
1305177886932967424 2020-09-14 00:13:51 +0800 <sprbrighting> Anti Christian Trump is advocating chaos instead Law &amp; Order. 😒 We pay billions for police &amp; criminal courts to prevent that very chaos.
1305175118927200257 2020-09-14 00:02:51 +0800 <sprbrighting> Why doesn’t the judge in charge of Roger Stone’s incarceration for lying shut him up. Put him back in prison &amp; release Reality Winner.
1305174557603504128 2020-09-14 00:00:38 +0800 <sprbrighting> @AlotHealth Oh goody. More mean spirited, agist, lazy, promoted tweets. Speak to a few boomers before you post this trash. Boomer girls learned to cook everything from scratch. Frozen food? It was expensive, chemical free &amp; very limited.

1304508251870957568 2020-09-12 03:52:58 +0800 <sprbrighting> They should both take a drug test before the debate, don’t you think?
1304506378006929408 2020-09-12 03:45:31 +0800 <sprbrighting> @cariebh @lauferlaw The constitution specifically says the president has the power of pardon “except in cases of impeachment.”
1304504152781881344 2020-09-12 03:36:41 +0800 <sprbrighting> Is roger Stone helping the Trump campaign?
1304500607823171584 2020-09-12 03:22:36 +0800 <sprbrighting> Exactly.
1304500218960936960 2020-09-12 03:21:03 +0800 <sprbrighting> So Trump is taking performance enhancing drugs, if his projections hold true. Whatever he accuses someone else of doing, he is doing.
1304499557120667649 2020-09-12 03:18:25 +0800 <sprbrighting> Impossible
1304444020966305794 2020-09-11 23:37:44 +0800 <sprbrighting> Is the Trump/GOP denying help to American workers &amp; small businesses so that they’ll lose their housing, get evicted &amp; be unable to vote?

Are they all like the girl who has an affair with a married man, breaks up the marriage &amp; marries him thinking he won’t cheat on “her”?

1304119576506986496 2020-09-11 02:08:31 +0800 <sprbrighting> 40% of COVID asymptomatic survivors in the NFL have heart inflammation. That could mean 40% or more of the 6 million plus people who have tested positive so far will suffer permanent heart damage. Where’s the media reporting on this?
1304118736635326465 2020-09-11 02:05:10 +0800 <sprbrighting> @threadreaderapp @FredDouglis @davidfrum Trump is manipulating the stock market right now, buying junk bonds with US taxpayer money. That’s the only reason it’s up.   He’ll bankrupt us &amp; we can’t let him or anyone profit in any way from the Trump/GOP COVID19 disastrous failure.
1304118046911377408 2020-09-11 02:02:26 +0800 <sprbrighting> @davidfrum @mortgageconsult I confronted a Trump supporting neighbor. I said Trump attacked social security. If he bankrupts it like his casinos she could lose her house. Live in a camper. She said my native Am husband &amp; I should leave the country, but we can’t. Trump’s failed virus policy traps us all.
1304112152802811905 2020-09-11 01:39:01 +0800 <sprbrighting> Trump just bought himself &amp; his oligarch buddies time to sell their stocks that would be hurt by the virus &amp; buy stocks that would be helped by it.

1303745640933986309 2020-09-10 01:22:37 +0800 <sprbrighting> @Baldrick_001 @ShahidH52359046 @chelliebeach954 Thank you. Stunning.
1303728303572877312 2020-09-10 00:13:44 +0800 <sprbrighting> They’re prosecuting people for voting twice in the primary?? How ridiculous.
1303727472668680193 2020-09-10 00:10:26 +0800 <sprbrighting> Hand marked paper ballot.
1303413056915996677 2020-09-09 03:21:03 +0800 <sprbrighting> @Reuters @motherjuggs I grew up there. Was in Piedmont for the fires that swept through, killed 24 &amp; burned hundreds of homes. They’re terrifying every time.
1303390497860321280 2020-09-09 01:51:25 +0800 <sprbrighting> @davidmackau @sevenbowie I wonder how many police are followers, secretly hiding their racism so they can remain in power funded by the very people they target.
1303373673861062656 2020-09-09 00:44:34 +0800 <sprbrighting> @BuildStrength This will be good for cement &amp; other types of construction. Contractors better up their techniques.
1303372563372937222 2020-09-09 00:40:09 +0800 <sprbrighting> @AttorneyCrump @JorgaStevens Why aren’t these rogue cops ashamed?
1303371794938695680 2020-09-09 00:37:06 +0800 <sprbrighting> @socsqueez @Darlene_Edw @pesachlattin To me, it looks like Mercer has horns that are literally starting to protrude from his forehead.
1303371445377015809 2020-09-09 00:35:42 +0800 <sprbrighting> @socsqueez @Darlene_Edw @pesachlattin Mercer looks angry, mean, dangerous &amp; arrogant to me. Anybody else get that?
1303355225835597824 2020-09-08 23:31:15 +0800 <sprbrighting> What if Trump has a completely debilitating stroke before Nov 3rd? Will his violent minions vote Pence?
1303351329444646913 2020-09-08 23:15:46 +0800 <sprbrighting> I stopped flying years ago. Just can’t see paying to be tortured.
1303351080391041025 2020-09-08 23:14:47 +0800 <sprbrighting> So Trump’s not getting donations. Good sign.
1303160565502672897 2020-09-08 10:37:45 +0800 <sprbrighting> Trump?
1303088646992453633 2020-09-08 05:51:58 +0800 <sprbrighting> It’s illegal to cover your license plate. Where are the police? Lots of pictures of participants &amp; vehicle might help.
1303087444284157953 2020-09-08 05:47:11 +0800 <sprbrighting> Is this a new way to trick people into viewing an hour or two of hypnotize propaganda?
1303084670041481216 2020-09-08 05:36:10 +0800 <sprbrighting> After we are through with Trump we must end corporate control of newspapers, radio, TV, Internet.   We never used to let foreigners own newspapers.   We didn’t allow monopolies I’d newspapers, radio, TV.   We required equal time for politicians.   We limited ads.
1303030161831419906 2020-09-08 01:59:34 +0800 <sprbrighting> Since when is walking on a pathway through a cemetery “meandering”?
1303028076964581376 2020-09-08 01:51:17 +0800 <sprbrighting> @thebr0keb0i It may cost you more than that if he wins.
1303027557772660737 2020-09-08 01:49:13 +0800 <sprbrighting> @thebr0keb0i What embarrasses me most is having family &amp; friends who blindly idolize Trump. That hurts!
1303026872213667840 2020-09-08 01:46:30 +0800 <sprbrighting> @thebr0keb0i We’ll put.
1303026531711631361 2020-09-08 01:45:08 +0800 <sprbrighting> @mycandiopinion They never miss a chance to spin or obfuscate.
1303024591699279872 2020-09-08 01:37:26 +0800 <sprbrighting> @rezaaslan @ushadrons Any time a Trump minion expresses anger you know you’re hitting a nerve.
1303012764907053057 2020-09-08 00:50:26 +0800 <sprbrighting> @ushadrons I’m reacting to him. Sorry if it sounded like I was telling the choir what to sing.
1303011191753588736 2020-09-08 00:44:11 +0800 <sprbrighting> @ushadrons We use masks for sand storms, sawdust, chemicals, smoke inhalation. You propose we risk death &amp; permanent heart damage by not wearing a mask to protect us from a virus? When are you passing out smallpox blankets?   Protect your family.  Wear a mask.
1302685286200217600 2020-09-07 03:09:09 +0800 <sprbrighting> @tribelaw @thinkkimthink Photograph your ballot &amp; save it.
1302679721260449799 2020-09-07 02:47:02 +0800 <sprbrighting> @daralynn13 @srmduke87 Pure joy.
1302653842190819328 2020-09-07 01:04:12 +0800 <sprbrighting> This from the birtherists who attacked Obama every day for the past what? 16 years? And who attacked John McCain, Nancy Pelosi &amp; Hillary relentlessly.
1302645190797086720 2020-09-07 00:29:50 +0800 <sprbrighting> Take a pix of your ballot before you mail it or at the polls before you finish voting. They may be needed.
1302642569420005376 2020-09-07 00:19:25 +0800 <sprbrighting> @GeorgeMonbiot @the_ecologist Before Reagan we had laws against monopolies &amp; foreign ownership of media including newspapers, radio &amp; TV.   There were limits minutes of advertising sold per minute of actual programming.   We own the internet &amp; airwaves &amp; should not let billionaires run media.
1302295292084011009 2020-09-06 01:19:27 +0800 <sprbrighting> @JarrettStepman If you get a ballot for a state where you no longer live, just throw it out. Or shred it.   What’s the big deal?   They have to be signed by the voter &amp; the voting rolls are checked &amp; the signatures are verified for every ballot.
1302294232795815936 2020-09-06 01:15:15 +0800 <sprbrighting> @Amy_Siskind Of course he wants everyone who calls him out fired.   Let’s fire Trump instead &amp; reward the brave public servants &amp; citizens who tell Americans the truth.
1302293789256552448 2020-09-06 01:13:29 +0800 <sprbrighting> @chipfranklin @NikkiHaley Everyone in gov needs to stop lying about Anything!   We need a new citizens branch of state &amp; federal government that can summarily remove a politician or appointee from office or any court or policing function for Lying to the public about Anything.   I volunteer.
1302066007637331968 2020-09-05 10:08:22 +0800 <sprbrighting> @MaryanneChisho2 Boy he dropped it in a hurry. Lol
1302055958802096131 2020-09-05 09:28:26 +0800 <sprbrighting> @MaryanneChisho2 As soon as we give them wallets.
1302055666673094656 2020-09-05 09:27:16 +0800 <sprbrighting> But they can’t handle money.
1302055417116332032 2020-09-05 09:26:17 +0800 <sprbrighting> So odd that we feel comfortable controlling the lives of pets.
1302036994357211136 2020-09-05 08:13:04 +0800 <sprbrighting> One reason people won’t want proof they had COVID is it will be a pre-existing condition that will mean they &amp; their kids &amp; parents will have their health insurance canceled. It causes inflammation of the heart even in asymptomatic athletes.
1302003820579389442 2020-09-05 06:01:15 +0800 <sprbrighting> Even if Trump can’t be indicted why haven’t his co-conspirators like DeJoy been indicted?
1301944760010076161 2020-09-05 02:06:34 +0800 <sprbrighting> Oh, they know why.
1301802114868416512 2020-09-04 16:39:45 +0800 <sprbrighting> Exactly.
1301798939297947648 2020-09-04 16:27:08 +0800 <sprbrighting> Why not delete FB now &amp; stop supporting this traitor?
1301598644768927744 2020-09-04 03:11:14 +0800 <sprbrighting> @PolitclSideshow @WilliamKreber Reality. Jon Stewart was so right to choose you to take over the Daily Show.
1301597623896293376 2020-09-04 03:07:10 +0800 <sprbrighting> Bill Barr’s whole existence is a disaster.
1301597086731759616 2020-09-04 03:05:02 +0800 <sprbrighting> It's time for lawmakers to #ProtectPatients and fix the harmful practice of surprise medical bills!  https://t.co/LUfttPWwF1
1301594805441454080 2020-09-04 02:55:58 +0800 <sprbrighting> @catalinagaitan_ Any police officer who points a weapon at the press should be fired &amp; never be allowed to own or brandish a weapon in America again.
1301575651082739713 2020-09-04 01:39:51 +0800 <sprbrighting> @karebear0517 Yes
1301562637495316480 2020-09-04 00:48:09 +0800 <sprbrighting> @LouiseMensch Gross.
1301557202973413376 2020-09-04 00:26:33 +0800 <sprbrighting> @politvidchannel Great offer, but the people in charge don’t want them open.  Also many elderly people routinely work the poles and they’re avoiding COVID by giving up those temporary jobs.
1301556117999214598 2020-09-04 00:22:14 +0800 <sprbrighting> Now that Trump has encouraged election fraud on a grand scale, it will take even longer to properly count the votes. We may see President Pelosi on January 20th.
1301555096279347201 2020-09-04 00:18:11 +0800 <sprbrighting> How many primaries are still happening? If Trump supporters vote twice we can catch them &amp; throw a few thousand in jail, strip them of the right to ever vote again.
1301188914300907521 2020-09-03 00:03:06 +0800 <sprbrighting> What?  GOP death panels are already in place forcing doctors to decide who gets a hospital bed because they helped COVID spread out of control. Now he wants doctors or nurses or owners of nursing homes deciding who lives? Nazi vermin policy. Make him resign.
1301187205071732736 2020-09-02 23:56:19 +0800 <sprbrighting> Trump is teaching his cult minions how to attack police? Doesn’t he know they’re parading their guns?  Does he want them throwing soup at windows &amp; peaceful protestors? He just torpedoed the excuse that it’s just food for their families.
1300844063403331585 2020-09-02 01:12:47 +0800 <sprbrighting> Maybe he’s describing the people he’s sending to disrupt Portland &amp; Kenosha.
1300813530971566082 2020-09-01 23:11:28 +0800 <sprbrighting> @JuliaDavisNews Trump hired all those people he called stupid &amp; incompetent. Only the best people, right?
