Afghan women bravely came out to support a "new" government w/ assurances that - at long last - their rights AS BEINGS would be codified in national constitution, freeing them from medieval religious repression.
1338842974122283009 2020-12-15 21:46:54 +0800 <treehuggingsis> @collage_64 Which is a lovely sentiment, but not, in fact, a defense against being brutalized at whim in that particular Stone Age society. Because the brutalizers say THEIR God allows the at-will carnage

1338840444357259270 2020-12-15 21:36:51 +0800 <treehuggingsis> The blame for the continued horrific subjugation of Afghan women lies squarely in George Bush's lap.   They trusted his promises that their rights as HUMAN BEINGS would be enshrined in a national constitution.  He betrayed them.

1338838063762595841 2020-12-15 21:27:23 +0800 <treehuggingsis> It should STILL seem like "abject madness," albeit now with the additional qualifier "unconscionable cruelty" added.

1329613600789565441 2020-11-20 10:32:40 +0800 <treehuggingsis> Jesus Christ. Pull yourselves together.  Tucker Carlson covering ALL of Guiliani's part of the presser, then telling folks they'd asked Sydney Powell for "evidence"(who wouldn't &amp; didn't?) &amp; asked her repeatedly to appear (she won't/ LEAVE ME ALONE) DOESN'T MAKE HIM THE BAD GUY
1329612056660750337 2020-11-20 10:26:31 +0800 <treehuggingsis> @tracybeanz @SidneyPowell1 Tucker is hardly "smarmy." I mean, come on as already. Let's get a grip here.

And could easily explain her theory of the case, but evidence needs to be held close until court due to vaporous nature. Tucker's cool. But tactical error.  Big time.

She can easily go on the show - as she has so many others - and explain what the case is, and why she can't hang whatever hard evidence out in space prior to court. I get that. I don't get why she won't go on his show. He is as cool and willing to listen as they come,

1329608254733901824 2020-11-20 10:11:25 +0800 <treehuggingsis> @JackPosobiec Sorry. She should have gone on Tucker. I don't get that move.
1329607899258216450 2020-11-20 10:10:00 +0800 <treehuggingsis> @RaheemKassam I don't think 1) Tucker went "after" her 2) Sidney did herself any favors telling his show not to 'contact her any more' EXCUSE me? She can go on all these other shows, but arguably the largest venue for her case, and...she is dissing them? That makes no sense.
1329606813407453185 2020-11-20 10:05:41 +0800 <treehuggingsis> @DaveinTexas @crazycatkid @JimDelRey Exactly my point. Why NOT Tucker? Of ALL people?! I'm not looking askance at him. I'm wondering why SHE didn't.

Your legs are about to MELT, and folks coming down go "You're almost there!" and you think GREAT!!  They're ALL LYING. But it works.   You get to the top, and then LIE to everyone you pass DYING on the way down.ü§£

It is not there to report honestly on either President Trump's accomplishments nor his faults with equal vigor. It now exists solely to protect the Democratic nominee's back. It is a functionary arm of the Democratic party.

1318167486077014016 2020-10-19 20:29:53 +0800 <treehuggingsis> @DulyB1 @Bacon_Is_King @mtaibbi That's not at all what the breathless hyperbole on the major broadcasts would have you believe. Every CASE is announced as if they'd dropped dead in the streets.  More fun to scare folks into not asking questions that way, inferring cases = hospitalizations and/ or deaths.

You do not determine a state of grace for yourself.  Your words and actions do that Or not.

How much has Biden paid on MILLIONS earned as a "public servant"? (Figure that one.) And HIS family?  In a dodgy tax shelter state, no less?

The 2005 tax return leaks were supposed to sink him for the write-offs...until they realized he STILL paid $38M TAX on $150M income, which was a higher tax rate than either Bernie or Obama ever did.

The lumbering, slumbering, benign Yertle the Turtle of their early and effortless scorn has hidden razor sharp teeth, active cunning, and blinding speed under that blocky carapace the whole time.

Their forecast discussion up to 11 pm the night before landfall was a pablum of model based bullshit, and ZERO REAL forecasting. No one blames them for where it goes, but WHAT comes in is an entirely different story.

1307456553440759809 2020-09-20 07:08:28 +0800 <treehuggingsis> Violence is their trump card.

(3d was a staff BGen)  3 Marines.  50 Army brass and 50 Navy.  Petty bastard.
