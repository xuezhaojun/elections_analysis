1341768277949878272 2020-12-23 23:31:00 +0800 <SGTValadez> There should be law requiring a summary of every bill to be published with Congressman names 10 days before it is sent to the President.

1338704398009192448 2020-12-15 12:36:15 +0800 <SGTValadez> @ASoftstar I gave those years to my country.  Found out I have 1000s brothers that I would die for.  I did more and saw more in 1 year than most do in a lifetime. 18 was the best!
1338637609355128832 2020-12-15 08:10:51 +0800 <SGTValadez> @gen_hula No. Just a pissed POTUS.  Trump asked him to resign.
1338634948140560384 2020-12-15 08:00:16 +0800 <SGTValadez> @gen_hula I thought he was doing a good up until the Hunters laptop.  After that there was nothing from the AGs office one way or the other. The last straw was when he said there was no evidence of election fraud.
1338622447814406147 2020-12-15 07:10:36 +0800 <SGTValadez> @gen_hula Not this time.
1338621432197238789 2020-12-15 07:06:34 +0800 <SGTValadez> We all thought he resigned when Hunter's laptop was found.  THE GHOST AG!

She was the only one who showed me there was a better life than hang around the wrong crowd.   I can never repay her.  She made a difference.
1337897412908773376 2020-12-13 07:09:34 +0800 <SGTValadez> @Lin56095573 They would eat their own for power.

1337883968964857857 2020-12-13 06:16:09 +0800 <SGTValadez> Can everyone see what is happening now?  The deep state is making their power play on Joe Biden.  Changing history.
