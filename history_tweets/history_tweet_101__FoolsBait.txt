1328793265156595713 2020-11-18 04:12:56 +0800 <_FoolsBait> @kaihamour @Taykin4Reidoom This sounds neat!
1323024427488059393 2020-11-02 06:09:38 +0800 <_FoolsBait> Our brains are weird because if you have not been okay for so long and then you take steps to heal yourself, the moment you start to feel better, the sensation is so different from what you are used to that you don't like it. Or at least that's how it is for me.

1316471931944734720 2020-10-15 04:12:22 +0800 <_FoolsBait> @iampriyagill In the comics that the Boys is based on Storm Front was actually a clone of Hitler and it was based on a lot more Nazi scientist stuff. The fact that the writers pulled out a lot of the problematic components is a touch of brilliance on their part.

1311995077015810050 2020-10-02 19:42:56 +0800 <_FoolsBait> @IsTheDm Thanks dude!
1311843139146190848 2020-10-02 09:39:11 +0800 <_FoolsBait> @IsTheDm I'm writing my Master's Thesis on D&amp;D. You know it has its talons in me for life.
1311836903486955520 2020-10-02 09:14:25 +0800 <_FoolsBait> My DM put a giant 4 story tall sword in the world as a symbol for the kingdom. Guess whose Hexblade/Pact of the Blade Warlock now has the equivalent of a building he can drop on people.
1310738631531704320 2020-09-29 08:30:16 +0800 <_FoolsBait> Being burnt out around the funniest roommates in existence is a surreal experience. Like, I don't have them energy left to laugh authentically and if I force it it's going to hurt my soul.

1309574993945264128 2020-09-26 03:26:23 +0800 <_FoolsBait> @joeyhazellm5 That makes so much more sense now. Lol
1309572459344035840 2020-09-26 03:16:19 +0800 <_FoolsBait> So, if I put a purple colour on a character they don't need to be described the outfit in the final copy like the artist would have to in the script. It feels more like a theatre production than anything else and that is magical to me. 6/6
1309572458425573378 2020-09-26 03:16:19 +0800 <_FoolsBait> Because in novels, things that might be subtle still need to be told to the reader. In graphic novels, they can be these very small things that can mean so much and are hinted at without any of the dialogue needing to address it. 5/6
1309572457456709632 2020-09-26 03:16:19 +0800 <_FoolsBait> So, I need to know how he feels, what he is emoting, how someone who might be angry could show that they are through simple actions. And showing over telling is so much more crucial to the medium. But this is an amazing thing. 4/6
1309572456525582336 2020-09-26 03:16:18 +0800 <_FoolsBait> If it's described in a novel that a guy walks over and picks something up, the reader only has their own imagination to interpret exactly how he does it and it takes like one sentence to explain. But because it's in comic format I am also responsible for what the reader sees. 3/6
1309572455111909378 2020-09-26 03:16:18 +0800 <_FoolsBait> Comics are so different because it's not just you writing for an audience, or at least it's not for me, because the artist needs it translated to them first. I have no artistic talents whatsoever and I need the amazing @joeyhazellm5 to understand everything I want to show. 2/6
1309572453912510464 2020-09-26 03:16:18 +0800 <_FoolsBait> Okay, so for over a month, I have been doing the script writing for a @kaihamour and let me be the first to say that the learning curve is probably the steepest I have ever experienced. Like, if you have ever written a story you know how the basic narrative is set up. 1/6
