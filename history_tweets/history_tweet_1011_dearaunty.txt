1343927836109926401 2020-12-29 22:32:19 +0800 <dearaunty> @realJimJamieson Too late!
1343922902127816706 2020-12-29 22:12:43 +0800 <dearaunty> @philliphodson We should call him 'His Earnestship' from now on! I still have visions of him stroking daffodils
1343922490595278856 2020-12-29 22:11:05 +0800 <dearaunty> @NeilView I ran out of that a while back!
1343922316057706497 2020-12-29 22:10:23 +0800 <dearaunty> @bea_johanssen @STVNews Ha, yes, there's that too!
1343922191755321345 2020-12-29 22:09:54 +0800 <dearaunty> @RobertRees_ @witherjay I like how when the Chinese control things in Africa, its beneficial, when we did it, it was bad Colonialism
1343911315493052417 2020-12-29 21:26:40 +0800 <dearaunty> @bea_johanssen @STVNews Agree. SocialServices are there to catch the needy -'blanket' approaches like free school meals for absolutely every child, or food banks with no means testing, are a waste. Child poverty figures guesstimated by charities &amp;  phrases like 'relative poverty' don't help tho.
1343908857391755265 2020-12-29 21:16:54 +0800 <dearaunty> @marinamaral2 Those eyes! Should've put some Wayfarers on them!
1343907534252486657 2020-12-29 21:11:39 +0800 <dearaunty> @likeuson @rumandcoffee I like the Queen, its all the useless hangers on i object to subsidising.  I would hate to see a 'President' &amp; prefer our system &amp; would have dreaded to think of that title bestowed upon Blair for instance!
1343906972601610244 2020-12-29 21:09:25 +0800 <dearaunty> @bea_johanssen @STVNews Try this simple test, put out a box of freestuff on your doorstep and see how many people will take it, regardless of need - its called creating a demand. There's a social services system in place to help the fallen, its either not fit for purpose or foodbanks are not not needed.
1343906169203601408 2020-12-29 21:06:13 +0800 <dearaunty> @DavidDPaxton @SCynic1 I've unfollowed people for less

1343905613399646209 2020-12-29 21:04:01 +0800 <dearaunty> @HeadBerry I blame education for only promoting one side of the revolution!
1343902571224821766 2020-12-29 20:51:56 +0800 <dearaunty> @LawMike @HoopoeMohican They'll be 'first against the wall,' come the revolution!!
1343902353259442176 2020-12-29 20:51:04 +0800 <dearaunty> @JonathanNichol4 @jessacc2 Its a global takeover. With all the usual suspects complicit
1343901879298879489 2020-12-29 20:49:11 +0800 <dearaunty> @HoopoeMohican @LawMike Like an appeasement policy! The naivety of Govts, EU, UN ... encourage 'them' to be just like us &amp; they will love democracy &amp; capitalism so much it will have a civilising effect. From euros to Iran &amp; Turkey, to elevated positions within UN councils for China &amp; Saudi. Insane
1343900350974189568 2020-12-29 20:43:06 +0800 <dearaunty> @HeadBerry Looking back through history, the revolutions are always lead by the sons and daughters of the middle or upper classes - even BinLaden and modern terror groups. The followers don't seem to see that though
1343897766276321281 2020-12-29 20:32:50 +0800 <dearaunty> @BraveSirRobin42 @TheOtherBond Yes, they do seem to be applying that to a wide range of 'woke' - not enough to be non-racist, you're either actively anti-racism or you're a racist! - saw the same idiocy applied to feminism - you're either pro 'all'  women, or you're transphobic
1343896716001636355 2020-12-29 20:28:40 +0800 <dearaunty> But, but, who will pay all their benefit cheques when Capitalism has been overthrown?

1343895254873886722 2020-12-29 20:22:51 +0800 <dearaunty> @NeilView Or its complicit
1343890599850762240 2020-12-29 20:04:21 +0800 <dearaunty> @TheOtherBond He  unblocked me for 7 minutes though once, *preens*
1343890411488743425 2020-12-29 20:03:37 +0800 <dearaunty> @LawMike Yes, someone else saying that too. Worrying
1343890297487548416 2020-12-29 20:03:09 +0800 <dearaunty> @NeilView &amp; yet no one appears to be worried about it!
1343888872300810247 2020-12-29 19:57:30 +0800 <dearaunty> @TheOtherBond Its proven, a definite connection between electronic 80's pap and soyboys

1343888079220834304 2020-12-29 19:54:20 +0800 <dearaunty> @TheOtherBond Never watched that either! I blame DuranDuran for Owen Jones.
1343887828288208896 2020-12-29 19:53:21 +0800 <dearaunty> @RamageKatharine How it should be

1343885270115094530 2020-12-29 19:43:11 +0800 <dearaunty> @HHelenakhl The effects on society is frightening - from the cost of inevitable feral teens crime, to long term benefits claimants, to strain on social services.

1343882450473267200 2020-12-29 19:31:58 +0800 <dearaunty> One country, in charge of the ports of Europe, what could possibly go wrong?  https://t.co/CEITF7XJ3f

1343880503863238656 2020-12-29 19:24:14 +0800 <dearaunty> @HeadBerry Mine used to eat the sausage, rolling the pill around the tongue as she went, then spat it out after she'd swallowed the sausage.

1343875622037295106 2020-12-29 19:04:50 +0800 <dearaunty> @HeadBerry You do know you're supposed to be in charge, right?
1343875366755196933 2020-12-29 19:03:50 +0800 <dearaunty> @StuartBettey Feral kids seem to be multiplying!
1343875091671756800 2020-12-29 19:02:44 +0800 <dearaunty> @TheOtherBond Glam rock,New Romantics, programmes like Mash, transvestite comedians... no one batted an eyelid then, the more its all being rammed down throats, the more intolerance is growing.
1343873350276423682 2020-12-29 18:55:49 +0800 <dearaunty> @TheOtherBond Loved that programme, she was great!
1343873235092459522 2020-12-29 18:55:21 +0800 <dearaunty> Not rocket science.   The more 'personal responsibility' the #NannyState assumes, the less personal responsibility some parents will take.   https://t.co/OcrHoEu0vD
1343872229684228097 2020-12-29 18:51:22 +0800 <dearaunty> @TheOtherBond Will it be a case of 'want it, so show up at a mash tent' then?
1343871557551218688 2020-12-29 18:48:41 +0800 <dearaunty> @BurnsideNotTosh Depends, so many questions.  Voluntary or enforced copulation? With or without drugs?   We talking 'Paul Newman' hotties or 'Corbyns' in shell suits?
1343870078257934336 2020-12-29 18:42:49 +0800 <dearaunty> @TheOtherBond Was wondering how they were going to cope!

1343867513860476928 2020-12-29 18:32:37 +0800 <dearaunty> @TheOtherBond When they say 'rolled out' - at the moment, no face-to-face appointments, hospital appointments limited - do they send out 'letters' ?
1343863203827220480 2020-12-29 18:15:30 +0800 <dearaunty> We just need to be entertained, not told how to think   https://t.co/5ldmeszirv

1343617732235952130 2020-12-29 02:00:05 +0800 <dearaunty> I like this idea.  #LeftOfCentreParks  'Hi-de-Hi' meets 'Comrade Dad'

1343582037068886018 2020-12-28 23:38:14 +0800 <dearaunty> I know, the EU only approved &amp; started vaccinating yesterday - ex-pat Remainers have been flying back to the UK, where it was rolled out weeks ago, if they wanted it.  https://t.co/735AQw5iF2

1336615993796390912 2020-12-09 18:17:40 +0800 <dearaunty> @LeicesterPolFed @DamCou If any police officer is smaller &amp; weaker than the 16yr old boy they're sent to arrest, then there needs to be frank debate &amp; questions asked about more realistic entry requirements &amp; 'gender quotas' - officers lives are on the line.

1336267189695942662 2020-12-08 19:11:39 +0800 <dearaunty> @MrAlecBowman The thread was tongue in cheek. The tweet was serious, including breakdancing is, imo, dumbing down &amp; making a mockery of a once respected event, like including Morris dancing. Why do you always seem so irked by my tweets?

1336259325262761984 2020-12-08 18:40:24 +0800 <dearaunty> @MrAlecBowman The thread was done with tongue in cheek after a chat about synchronised swimming.  Where's the ''blood, passion and extraordinary feats of athletic endeavour' in dancing? Who is expert enough to judge it? Will cheese rolling &amp; mechanical bucking bronco riding, be added

1327291689925566469 2020-11-14 00:46:13 +0800 <dearaunty> @orwell4ever @SkyNews However i look at it, Obama needs to look at why not all black votes went to him, just as not all women voted for the woman
1327281238630158336 2020-11-14 00:04:41 +0800 <dearaunty> @orwell4ever @SkyNews My point was he has black voters, Obama cant claim racism rather than policy failure as responsible for Trump, or presumably Hillary would've won.
1327279736863805440 2020-11-13 23:58:43 +0800 <dearaunty> @talkRADIO Authors are having content/characters dictated, we all see social media accounts suspended for 'wrong' opinions, careers are being lost, speakers are being de-platformed, 'critical race theory' &amp; 'unconscious bias' training coming to workplaces - daft question really

1324976604058181634 2020-11-07 15:26:53 +0800 <dearaunty> @melindiscott They have 'lists'  https://t.co/ow6Q7T0UTB
1324975452948230145 2020-11-07 15:22:19 +0800 <dearaunty> @melindiscott Can't believe its so close, he openly supports these people
1324974644009574401 2020-11-07 15:19:06 +0800 <dearaunty> @gbs2u @Stewarty2013 Roger Moore bedding Grace Jones was a low point
1324974054114254849 2020-11-07 15:16:45 +0800 <dearaunty> @HerrGruber My derision is reserved for the writers .Fleming is spinning - &amp; she's getting less derision than Tom Cruise playing Jack Reacher
1324972085035274240 2020-11-07 15:08:56 +0800 <dearaunty> @TheOtherBond It will be the death of it &amp; a big part of me thinks its deliberate
1324806269040025601 2020-11-07 04:10:02 +0800 <dearaunty> @HerrGruber 007 IS Bond
1324805933319507969 2020-11-07 04:08:42 +0800 <dearaunty> @Persixty @tweetd99 Always think Dick-of-the-yard models herself on Jane
1324805399854354433 2020-11-07 04:06:35 +0800 <dearaunty> @Trailer_Swift69 Mr Lammy's twitter is an interesting example of that
1324804001926385664 2020-11-07 04:01:02 +0800 <dearaunty> @HistoryUnchain Its what they seem to want
1324803750960287744 2020-11-07 04:00:02 +0800 <dearaunty> @tweetd99 @Persixty They killed the Doctor, they're killing tv drama &amp; decimating the film idustry
1324803195789627392 2020-11-07 03:57:50 +0800 <dearaunty> @Trailer_Swift69 Agree, wouldn't mind but the same people applauding this were outraged over an Israeli playing Cleopatra
1324802424276746251 2020-11-07 03:54:46 +0800 <dearaunty> @tweetd99 @Persixty I hope so
1324799818699517952 2020-11-07 03:44:25 +0800 <dearaunty> @Our_Hero_ @Trailer_Swift69 Why not  https://t.co/O8VKQ5l3WX
1324797032654118918 2020-11-07 03:33:20 +0800 <dearaunty> @Mike_demps7 Just said same to someone else
1324796764386480130 2020-11-07 03:32:16 +0800 <dearaunty> @CazzPink @anthea_bailey Anthea is on the naughty step, she made me splutter &amp; spit my rum out
1324796207055675395 2020-11-07 03:30:03 +0800 <dearaunty> @Persixty I actually believe that's what they want - 'men's' cinema is being strangled
1324795554233225219 2020-11-07 03:27:28 +0800 <dearaunty> @CazzPink @anthea_bailey So THAT's what they meant!!
1324795215534792708 2020-11-07 03:26:07 +0800 <dearaunty> @MrsSusieF Nothing wrong with that, applied to Sean too - &amp;I like suave rogues who mistreat women, its part of Bonds appeal
1324794400690577408 2020-11-07 03:22:53 +0800 <dearaunty> @Steel1Barry Could base it on Irish slaves
1324794150315843584 2020-11-07 03:21:53 +0800 <dearaunty> @MrsSusieF All of them but for me Brosnan did it better
1324793858086051842 2020-11-07 03:20:43 +0800 <dearaunty> @thellen72 Ah! sorry
1324793727169298438 2020-11-07 03:20:12 +0800 <dearaunty> @witherjay @MrsSusieF Therein lies the rub tho
1324793521304457219 2020-11-07 03:19:23 +0800 <dearaunty> @MrsSusieF He played it a bit stiff for me, literally, his top lip never moves
1324792999772041228 2020-11-07 03:17:19 +0800 <dearaunty> @thellen72 Who's Toby
1324792753667117062 2020-11-07 03:16:20 +0800 <dearaunty> @anthea_bailey Go &amp; sit over there &amp; think about what you said
1324792248131833858 2020-11-07 03:14:20 +0800 <dearaunty> @MrsSusieF I can take them jiggling about with characteristics &amp; old Bonds didn’t reflect many of the above either really- but casting a black, female is just sacrilege.
1324790640534835200 2020-11-07 03:07:56 +0800 <dearaunty> @_anonsocial Yes thank goodness that racist era has gone &amp; we've reduced black women to tokens in a woke new world
1324789961816768512 2020-11-07 03:05:14 +0800 <dearaunty> @Trailer_Swift69 I will be boycotting it - gone too far
1324789536841474048 2020-11-07 03:03:33 +0800 <dearaunty> @Knight21st Never
1324789271069396992 2020-11-07 03:02:30 +0800 <dearaunty> @lostcreatives1 Exactly, where are the new writers with fresh ideas ? Instead of trashing a much loved franchise &amp; hoping to ride off on the back of Fleming's books.
1324788010286829570 2020-11-07 02:57:29 +0800 <dearaunty> @matthewmoloney @NaomiLWood Too scrawny, no sex appeal. Don't '@' me
1324774878038425605 2020-11-07 02:05:18 +0800 <dearaunty> Nothing to do with 'hate' - Bond is a white bloke, a much loved character - cant just plonk a token female in the part &amp; expect fans to be thrilled.  Its like re-imagining 'Kunta Kinte' &amp; casting a white woman
1324769317922074624 2020-11-07 01:43:13 +0800 <dearaunty> @cold957 @markaw214 @MsBlackadder @ExWren @EileenTurner8 @teresadg0 @CarlBrasky @Steve1Sandwich Its being held on Remembrance Sunday, significant because traditional Remembrance Sunday at the Cenotaph is cancelled. Democratic freedoms are on hold because of a pandemic - the 'rules' of which should apply to all equally.
1324760653488422919 2020-11-07 01:08:47 +0800 <dearaunty> @willneedham Probably!
1324760294778900487 2020-11-07 01:07:21 +0800 <dearaunty> @TheOtherBond Never! If one wants a job done properly........
1324758587932086276 2020-11-07 01:00:34 +0800 <dearaunty> @GeneralLinji @danbloom1 &amp; this?  https://t.co/ZLFcHsLgV7

1324735387592495106 2020-11-06 23:28:23 +0800 <dearaunty> @Writerer @danbloom1 Feel free to twitter search the numerous vids &amp; articles &amp; commentary from journalists, yourself - all accusations of fraud should be investigated, or there is little point in voting. We either want democracy or we don't
1324713325339561990 2020-11-06 22:00:43 +0800 <dearaunty> @DrClarence2 @danbloom1 Guess so  https://t.co/ZLFcHsLgV7

1324710733788127234 2020-11-06 21:50:25 +0800 <dearaunty> @GeneralLinji @danbloom1 Guess we'll never know while its not investigated &amp; reported as fake news by media
1324709996832133127 2020-11-06 21:47:29 +0800 <dearaunty> @spidermanmsy @danbloom1 Funny because most prosecutions involve Labour wards
1324709476256067584 2020-11-06 21:45:25 +0800 <dearaunty> @SirTrevSkint Nothing to do with 'hate' - Bond is a white bloke, a much loved character - cant just plonk a token female in the part &amp; expect fans to be thrilled. Its like re-imagining 'Kunta Kinte' &amp; casting a white woman
1324707548457566212 2020-11-06 21:37:46 +0800 <dearaunty> Death of the franchise, right there
1324703477088555012 2020-11-06 21:21:35 +0800 <dearaunty> @danbloom1 Does 'every' vote include fraudulent ones?
1324702537140895749 2020-11-06 21:17:51 +0800 <dearaunty> @scrapegroat :) I follow Trump too
1324701714088415234 2020-11-06 21:14:35 +0800 <dearaunty> @scrapegroat I follow loads of 'leaders', doesn't mean i agree with them

1324699970235207681 2020-11-06 21:07:39 +0800 <dearaunty> @bencorke @KateAndrs @Telegraph Agree, but am giving the benefit of doubt, for now

1324696861190590464 2020-11-06 20:55:18 +0800 <dearaunty> @bencorke @KateAndrs @Telegraph There's that too
1324696247039643649 2020-11-06 20:52:51 +0800 <dearaunty> @clubbers007 @CSquireMagazine Only b'cos he couldn't get in, his legacy lives on, its just dressed better
1324695797116686344 2020-11-06 20:51:04 +0800 <dearaunty> @melindiscott @KateAndrs @Telegraph I'm despairing of Trump too but some balance from media would be nice.
1324695265476050947 2020-11-06 20:48:57 +0800 <dearaunty> Take comfort in the knowledge that we're no better than America .@CSquireMagazine 2019   https://t.co/6aaKgkXEEv
1324692275314741248 2020-11-06 20:37:04 +0800 <dearaunty> @melindiscott @KateAndrs @Telegraph No idea but we're living in the land of 'strange takes' at the moment
1324691625222852611 2020-11-06 20:34:29 +0800 <dearaunty> @bencorke @KateAndrs @Telegraph They all nick slogans - 'shoulder to shoulder' is one such
1324691052499030017 2020-11-06 20:32:13 +0800 <dearaunty> @melindiscott @KateAndrs @Telegraph Hmmm  https://t.co/vCiI6yDH5b
1324688650957971457 2020-11-06 20:22:40 +0800 <dearaunty> @KateAndrs @Telegraph 'This democratic challenger'... seriously? He kneels for BLM, supports the Mayors de-funding Police &amp; presiding over mayhem, while his 'stalking horse' VP is raising funds to bail-out #antifa. If Boris has anything in common with him, be afraid!  https://t.co/7qM11apLBQ

1324684280178552832 2020-11-06 20:05:18 +0800 <dearaunty> @SirBasilBrush If, *if* there's fraud, why should he go quietly? Obama, Clinton, &amp; the Left have been screaming about Russians/rape &amp; tax returns for 4yrs...now, fraud is #fakenews
1324682626825883648 2020-11-06 19:58:44 +0800 <dearaunty> @Markgsparrow Election? What election?

1324428839418843137 2020-11-06 03:10:16 +0800 <dearaunty> ..........&amp; the earrings
1324414304838422528 2020-11-06 02:12:31 +0800 <dearaunty> @PaulReadGB They would've been multitasking then too - birthing, cooking &amp; getting the mastodon smell out of carpet, nothing changes

1324412926325903361 2020-11-06 02:07:02 +0800 <dearaunty> @Little_G2 Just puts tom soup &amp; beans back to how they should be!

1324412003616698374 2020-11-06 02:03:22 +0800 <dearaunty> @LozzaFox No logic in any country, to be fair but, either shut everything or nothing - no sense in closing bars while allowing flights from everywhere, while banning gatherings, while keeping schools open ....&amp; don't get me started on devolved govts with different 'rules'

1324394683158712320 2020-11-06 00:54:33 +0800 <dearaunty> @_anonsocial Why do you hate women so
1324394365435990018 2020-11-06 00:53:17 +0800 <dearaunty> @AndyVonasch All you need to understand, is people have opposing views &amp; that they're free to reject your vision for the country. Analyse it all you like, neither Left nor Right will alter core beliefs/policies to win the other side over.
1324391415137378304 2020-11-06 00:41:34 +0800 <dearaunty> @Berrydede Me too but, would we interpret it any differently

1324354733625217024 2020-11-05 22:15:48 +0800 <dearaunty> @TheOtherBond @VinceGunning1 Haha - like when tv archeologists dig a trench &amp; tell us whereabouts the people who lived in it changed underpants

1324339435496943617 2020-11-05 21:15:01 +0800 <dearaunty> @ColonelShotover Exactly
1324337602317717504 2020-11-05 21:07:44 +0800 <dearaunty> Because they found a toolkit buried with a woman!  Could've been holding it for her hubby when she died.

Religion requires blind faith, which isn't logical! The problem here is fundamentalism, religious fundamentalism

1321770017675988993 2020-10-29 19:05:04 +0800 <dearaunty> @StarrittJames @soyoprincess Maybe they should simply pursue justice without the media, like many other victims do - when they've exhausted other avenues is the time for media photo-ops - not pre-funeral &amp; not by manipulating an 8yrold whose just lost his dad.
1321768264884736003 2020-10-29 18:58:06 +0800 <dearaunty> @RejectIdeology However i look at it, it's the religion. Islam,more than most is a political ideology,totalitarianism. All religions are man-made interpretations.  The problem with screaming'Islamophobia'is it shuts down argument/debate, we need to ignore it more &amp; get tougher on fundamentalists

1320836119110569985 2020-10-27 05:14:05 +0800 <dearaunty> @AtticumFloreat Not sure why other kids need to know who pays &amp; who  doesn't but for non-term time, surely supermarket food vouchers would solve the problem?
1320833734569009155 2020-10-27 05:04:36 +0800 <dearaunty> @AtticumFloreat My feelings on it is that the welfare system is in place with funds already on deposit, social services are there for Heads to liaise/target help to families in need &amp; rolling out FSM's for all kids regardless of need seems a waste of resources

1313499570865926148 2020-10-06 23:21:15 +0800 <dearaunty> @WinterfellT @ClaraWSparkles Because 'trans rights' means men in our daughters changing rooms &amp; there have already been convictions for sexual assaults ,by perverts, on minors - also convictions for rapes in women's prisons

1313123201732489218 2020-10-05 22:25:42 +0800 <dearaunty> @janeclarejones Not one Labour MP that i have tweeted will answer the following question: What is your definition of the word 'woman'?' They seem scared to.  Sooner or later Keir will have to pick a side.

1313116019628675072 2020-10-05 21:57:10 +0800 <dearaunty> Either call it 'The Prize' &amp; welcome all-comers. Or have it open for only women.  Allowing biological males to take part simply because they've dressed for the part, devalues the award.

1313070768864006146 2020-10-05 18:57:21 +0800 <dearaunty> Meanwhile in the UK people are referring to the Govt as 'hard-Right' &amp; 'fascists'

1313059029938302977 2020-10-05 18:10:42 +0800 <dearaunty> @WinterfellT Cant do much to change minority perception. The fault of the Left abandoning patriotism &amp; attacking all things British. Flags cant portray 'inclusivity' &amp; cant 'connect' with people who hate it - its not a 'brand' its an emblem
1313052943453749249 2020-10-05 17:46:31 +0800 <dearaunty> @markaw214 No, &amp; define 'internal repression'

1312795590695288833 2020-10-05 00:43:54 +0800 <dearaunty> @Gillian_Philip Whats the answer, for authors?
1312794794129842176 2020-10-05 00:40:44 +0800 <dearaunty> @Gillian_Philip So many signatories, afraid they'll never be published again? &amp; when publishers 'come out like this,' what it seems to say is 'we will dictate &amp; censor author content' - no?

1307662434900086785 2020-09-20 20:46:34 +0800 <dearaunty> @KatyMontgomerie @Finn_Mackay In our country, Trans people have the same rights as all other people - there is no such 'right' which forces others to join in their fantasies though. If i decide that particular issue is most important to me, then that's my right

1307641380555165696 2020-09-20 19:22:54 +0800 <dearaunty> @KatyMontgomerie @Finn_Mackay We live in a democracy, it means all voters can pick &amp; choose who they align with, based on whichever issues are important to them. Maybe if male trans weren't dictating speech, biology-denying, redefining the word 'woman' &amp; cheating in women's sports? #justathought

1303653631250628609 2020-09-09 19:17:01 +0800 <dearaunty> @mostly_sleepy @BNONews You need a technician/producer/director/actor/cameraman/script. You pick the best/most brilliant/creative one you can find - Its the only criteria needed because films have to generate audiences &amp; make money. Colour/race/gay/straight should be irrelevant

Indian takeaways, Polish deli's, Vietnamese corner shops&amp; law-abiding foreign citizens, aren't the problem.  Self-segregated 'communities', 30k on the watchlist, rape/assault/crime figures, no-go areas &amp; gangs stabbing people, are.

1301871710686380033 2020-09-04 21:16:18 +0800 <dearaunty> @StarkeyHazel I thought so,yes
1301871522450153473 2020-09-04 21:15:33 +0800 <dearaunty> @dang65 @AtticumFloreat @quodinfrequens @molioni @afneil We're talking about groceries &amp; advertising - not arms deals &amp; killing people, so perspective! It would win customers if theses companies ditched the virtue signalling &amp; said NO to the dictatorial, little fascist wannabes, trans or otherwise
1301868829547663360 2020-09-04 21:04:51 +0800 <dearaunty> @Lizziedl Its not up to @DrMikeFarquhar  to dictate opinions to individuals

1301865338401951746 2020-09-04 20:50:58 +0800 <dearaunty> @t_d_hughes @benhabib6 @DefundBBC Agree, but the constant giving of 'opinions.' is whats wrong &amp; if they praised &amp; slated equally it wouldn't get as much criticism - But it should be just 'news' - no 'hot takes/spin/or opinions' -
1301841163398385669 2020-09-04 19:14:55 +0800 <dearaunty> @ChiswickMcnabb Ah, the 'diversity' scam

Correct response to 'Lisa' should be to thank her for her correspondence &amp; that to reach a wide customer base, advertising in a wide variety of publications is necessary &amp; the contents of those publications is, rightly out of the  control of, &amp; none of Tesco's business
1301835509812129792 2020-09-04 18:52:27 +0800 <dearaunty> We live in a democracy, both Tony Abbott AND Matt Hancock are entitled to their views - since when did #CorrectThink become obligatory? Ask some of your religious MP's for their views on 'the rainbow?'

1301817306482434050 2020-09-04 17:40:07 +0800 <dearaunty> Watched The Accountant last night - why wasn't Ben Affleck cast as 'Jack Reacher'?  There's a sentence i never thought I'd say

1301813936426229761 2020-09-04 17:26:43 +0800 <dearaunty> Or.....grow up &amp; realise that in the great scheme of things you simply aren't THAT important

1301583455243952130 2020-09-04 02:10:52 +0800 <dearaunty> @MartinDaubney Easy enough to test, ask him how soon he will be showing some re-runs - Comedies like Allo Allo, Harry Enfield, Fawlty Towers, Blackadder or dramas like Life on Mars, or putting someone 'interesting' presenting debates where the audience isn't rigged?

1301526512290721792 2020-09-03 22:24:36 +0800 <dearaunty> Maybe Netflix can reimagine 'Roots' with a white Irish cast  https://t.co/zJOl17Myav

1301525406319890432 2020-09-03 22:20:12 +0800 <dearaunty> @AtticumFloreat I think lots of people just want entertaining, the sexual preferences of the dancers are irrelevant.

1301098823536779265 2020-09-02 18:05:07 +0800 <dearaunty> You know that '1984' was novel, not an instruction manual.....right?

1301069585517551616 2020-09-02 16:08:56 +0800 <dearaunty> @TheOtherBond It has to be photographic &amp; once its been used the computer stops it being used again

1301057396379398144 2020-09-02 15:20:30 +0800 <dearaunty> @MajorDMalpas I only watch the woman in the background signing. After a while its all you can see. I imagine her accompanying Nicola  to Tescos
1300849179477061633 2020-09-02 01:33:07 +0800 <dearaunty> Remember this? Since then the EU &amp; also Obama, went on to give billions to Turkey, Iran &amp; Palestine, all known to fund extremists. #JeSuisCharlie my arse  https://t.co/1DyszxBd3t
1300848050290688007 2020-09-02 01:28:38 +0800 <dearaunty> @astroehlein @MrRogerFlatt Perspective would be nice! The people would appreciate decent political satire, cutting edge comedy that pokes fun at all politicians regardless, stand-up that mocks every/anything because there's an 'off' button' - this has not been difficult in the past,why is it now?
1300805612993998849 2020-09-01 22:40:00 +0800 <dearaunty> @PeteButtigieg Ask yourself:Would this moment, or any moment, be a good time to elect a president whose VP is funding the chaos?  https://t.co/AzXF040vdq

1300795011806769160 2020-09-01 21:57:53 +0800 <dearaunty> @ThomasCatenacci Most excited about his forthcoming Presidential twitter account, even with the high bar that has been set
1300784158327922688 2020-09-01 21:14:45 +0800 <dearaunty> @metpoliceuk To a number of the public, your policing response to events seems to differ according to who is protesting. Wearing paramilitary uniforms, blocking streets, criminal damage, be interesting to know how many arrests were made just for those 3 crimes.  https://t.co/amjQqQbJc8
