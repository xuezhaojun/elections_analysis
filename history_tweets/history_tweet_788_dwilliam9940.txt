Indeed, it would appear government itself has become infected with this same political virus.

1341431303435120643 2020-12-23 01:11:59 +0800 <dwilliam9940> @Joyceeee77 Too much corruption, too much politicking, too much for many to lose for the serious change needed. The NHS myth still too deeply embedded in the British psyche.
1341430635857145861 2020-12-23 01:09:20 +0800 <dwilliam9940> When administering the mRNA vaccines to a hapless public, medics need to look seriously again at the hypocratic oath they once swore: "...I will never do any harm to anyone. To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug, nor give advice which many cause his death"
1341429552980127744 2020-12-23 01:05:02 +0800 <dwilliam9940> Many wil have died in this crisis because of medical abuses, massive egos of politicians, scientists and medics, arrogance and ignorance operating within an outdated and cumbersome healthcare system. Charlatans abound.
1341428696977182727 2020-12-23 01:01:38 +0800 <dwilliam9940> Within the medical and scientific world proven facts are persistently ignored and we have been conditioned and manipulated into believing 'doctors and scientists know best'. Other interests than our wellbeing come first.
1341427773689262082 2020-12-23 00:57:58 +0800 <dwilliam9940> Is the NHS worth saving? The medical establishment hand in glove with bankers is corrupt and financially driven. Covid will prove to be extremely lucrative, dedicated to promoting all kinds of Pharma funded procedures and drugs, including useless risky vaccines.

1340958378206646272 2020-12-21 17:52:45 +0800 <dwilliam9940> Should our politicians keep asking for trouble as they are, then no warning or exhortation will keep them from getting what they want.
1340957876467150850 2020-12-21 17:50:46 +0800 <dwilliam9940> When politicians exceed their authority, they act as private persons and their 'law-making' becomes meaningless and they incriminate themselves. This is exactly what is happening. Must be held to account by the people.
1340956941582020608 2020-12-21 17:47:03 +0800 <dwilliam9940> At the moment politicians are riding so high on their horses. They think they are seated so firm in the saddle that no one can unhorse them. They are very much mistaken.
1340956594763345920 2020-12-21 17:45:40 +0800 <dwilliam9940> Non-compliance, disobedience is the first and chief way open to us of resisting government. Obedience is not due to 'rules' not having the authority of parliament so that disobedience is inculpable and punishment not due. Let's do it!

1337733831378526208 2020-12-12 20:19:33 +0800 <dwilliam9940> There is absolutely no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic. You do not vaccinate people who aren‚Äôt at risk from a disease. You also don‚Äôt set about planning to vaccinate millions of fit, healthy people with vaccine that hasn‚Äôt been extensively tested on human subjects
1337732991917969408 2020-12-12 20:16:13 +0800 <dwilliam9940> Critical voices have been quickly slandered and defamed. Sadly, there are still those who believe because it appeared on BBC, it must be true. The numbers of such gullible unquestioning ‚Äòbelievers‚Äô is thankfully dwindling. The lying media is being seen for what it is.
1337732532759048194 2020-12-12 20:14:24 +0800 <dwilliam9940> Disturbing scenes, frightening numbers filled our TV screens. No investigation of warnings merely uncritical regurgitation. Fatalities taken as read without mentioning that based on model calculations largely by Neil Ferguson, with notorious reputation for wild inaccuracy
1337730890785550337 2020-12-12 20:07:52 +0800 <dwilliam9940> Even when a vaccination is successful and a production of protective antibodies has taken place, this does not guarantee immunity. Even worse, antibody production will decline after just a few short months. Protection should it be achieved at all is transient.
1337730393991225344 2020-12-12 20:05:54 +0800 <dwilliam9940> Government actions a devastated our economy, destroyed livelihoods, cost lives and disrupted health care not saved it. Domestic violence increased as did the number of suicides. How can our politicians live with themselves? They must have hearts of stone.
1337729892365037569 2020-12-12 20:03:54 +0800 <dwilliam9940> Very clear SARS-CoV-2 is not a killer virus and the exponential increase in infections just did not happen. Yet we have paid an appalling and disproportionate price in an attempt to contain a danger that never existed. Unspeakable suffering inflicted on us by spreading fear.
1337728867654651904 2020-12-12 19:59:50 +0800 <dwilliam9940> What a total waste of OUR money! So-called ‚ÄòNightingale‚Äô hospitals erected in England everywhere for an influx of Covid victims that never materialised. Our government spent ¬£569m on 20,900 ventilators of which most to this day remain in the boxes in which they were delivered.
1337728360781373440 2020-12-12 19:57:49 +0800 <dwilliam9940> A study published in The Lancet indicated that government lockdowns were ineffective. Researchers collected data from the 50 countries and found lockdowns were not associated with mortality reductions in COVID-19 cases, although factors such as obesity, smoking were.
1337727544217509889 2020-12-12 19:54:34 +0800 <dwilliam9940> It was Hannah Arendt, looking closely at totalitarianism who stated that if you scare the population, you can do anything with it.
1337727295046512640 2020-12-12 19:53:35 +0800 <dwilliam9940> COVID-19 is a quite nasty disease that causes sickness in some people, is fatal to a few and leaves everyone else untouched. Much like any other ‚Äòflu, if you have it you stay at home and keep away from grandma and grandad. This is only what we have always done.
1337726931870101510 2020-12-12 19:52:08 +0800 <dwilliam9940> Covid-19 is the severe illness that occurs in around 10% of persons infected with the virus SARS-CoV-2. Not everyone with the virus is a COVID-19 case. Deliberate confusion: number of ‚Äòcases‚Äô surged so that the virus wrongly shot to the top of the existential threats to the world
1337725018910957570 2020-12-12 19:44:32 +0800 <dwilliam9940> Despite the misleading impressions awakened by NHS ads on TV, Corona viruses are not new, have long been with us and co-exist with humans and animals undergoing countless genetic mutations. They are the cause of 10-20% of all respiratory infections. Many infected show no symptoms
1337724192813424642 2020-12-12 19:41:15 +0800 <dwilliam9940> A global vaccination programme is postured as a cure-all, but is this practicable or even scientifically sound? Either we have all been in grave danger or this is the biggest hoax ever foisted on mankind.
1337724003335753729 2020-12-12 19:40:30 +0800 <dwilliam9940> Lockdown, go outside surreal, ghostly, streets, deserted. Shops boarded up, some never to reopen. Social life all but gone and the economy  in a state of inevitable collapse. Students are locked away in their halls of residence, suicides are soaring. Heads must roll at SAGE.

1333819730273177602 2020-12-02 01:06:19 +0800 <dwilliam9940> Governments have inflected unspeakable suffering on us by proclaiming an pandemic that did not exist, deliberately spreading fear. They have deprived us of our rights with no good reason. Decisions have been arbitrary not evidence-based, senseless lockdown and mask-wearing.
1333819728989741058 2020-12-02 01:06:19 +0800 <dwilliam9940> SARS-CoV-2 is not a killer virus and the exponential increase in new infections just did not happen. Yet we have paid an appalling and disproportionate price in an attempt to contain a danger that never existed.
1333815162600632323 2020-12-02 00:48:10 +0800 <dwilliam9940> So we were told Covid-19 was like excruciating slow suffocation. Then children were a dangerous source of infection who could carry the deadly virus to parents and grandparents. Although such dangers could not be shown to exist, the main thing was that people were frightened.
1333815161405267969 2020-12-02 00:48:10 +0800 <dwilliam9940> From the outset fearmongering was the official strategy of governments to manage the perceived epidemic. It was essential to report excessively high numbers of deaths otherwise the situation would appear too trivial. A massive shock effect was needed.
1333814172447105026 2020-12-02 00:44:14 +0800 <dwilliam9940> Viruses never entirely disappear. Every year a season of ‚Äòflu also a season of coronavirus. A government wanting a second wave only needs radically increase number of tests while the coronavirus season is in full swing. This manipulation triggers the desired laboratory pandemic.
1333812824523599878 2020-12-02 00:38:53 +0800 <dwilliam9940> Spanish flu broke out at end of WW1. No one mentions, secondary bacterial infections were main cause of death before antibiotics were available. People of all ages perished. Anyone comparing Covid-19 and Spanish ‚Äòflu is either ignorant or deliberately using it to scare people
1333808348995723265 2020-12-02 00:21:06 +0800 <dwilliam9940> @CentrioleT @BreitbartNews So I understand
1333808198596354056 2020-12-02 00:20:30 +0800 <dwilliam9940> The fear that asymptomatic people can pass on the deadly virus to others has been shown to be false. Yet this has been the driving force behind many extreme preventative measures such as cruel visiting bans and mandatory mask-wearing. Ignorant and scandalous.
1333808197480669188 2020-12-02 00:20:29 +0800 <dwilliam9940> COVID-19 is a quite nasty disease that cause sickness in some people, is fatal to a few and leaves everyone else untouched. Much like any other ‚Äòflu, if you have it you stay at home and keep away from grandma and grandad. This is only what we have always done.
1333806727200960517 2020-12-02 00:14:39 +0800 <dwilliam9940> @natashad70 Sure, love her to bits! We spoil all our grandchildren - and children sometimes!!

1333798791309193216 2020-12-01 23:43:07 +0800 <dwilliam9940> @DJSiri The truth: vaccines will NOT cure Covid; will NOT prevent people from contracting it; will NOT prevent Covid-related hospitalizations; will NOT prevent Covid caused deaths. Thanks, but no thanks!

1324369781848444929 2020-11-05 23:15:36 +0800 <dwilliam9940> A police State is not a place where officers strut around in jackboots, but where there is unprecedented invasion into areas of our lives that have previously always been thought of as being private.
