With the PANDEMIC spiking again, many schools will close again.  Then we need small group instruction sites for parents who can't be home for virtual leaning monitoring.

When the GOP have pushed funds for publicly traded companies / Corporate America (their donors) over local small businesses, something is wrong! Mainstreet is more important to the economy than Wallsteet!

It moved form definitely R to likely R this past Summer.  District 2 is Ruby Red. People vote straight R w/o thinking, but maybe more will scrutinize the vote closer since Trump.

1315810446461620224 2020-10-13 08:23:51 +0800 <LancelotLinkSpy> @RyanForSC @MurdockResists I married my wife a little over 5 yrs ago when it became legal for same sex partners to marry. It means a lot more than you think! Under the law we can cover our spouse &amp; children w/health insurance,etc. Why should anyone be treated like 2nd class citizens based on who they love?

They think well-off Americans need a reward for just being affluent &amp; likely white! They're fine with the working class subsidizing their entiteled attitude, because it keeps the poor in their place!

Can they actually verify the signature of the witness?ü§î  It just seems a little rediculous. Only those requesting ballots by mail get them sent to their address of record.

A lot of it is that the GOP want to divert tax dollars to private schools who teach their religious views rather than science, and some of it is just pure sexism, since teachers are mostly female.

Typically prisoners have done the cooking in the past, but with #COVID19, who knows who is cooking/providing them food. I am hoping that is just a pic of a special diet, but it doesn't look appetizing or nutritional!
