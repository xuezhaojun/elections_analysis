1343963228167168000 2020-12-30 00:52:57 +0800 <Jefiner68> @FlintGooch13 Works are definitely different right now. We we have an Adoration Chapel in town. I haven't done Adoration in 9 months. I can't believe the churches are open.   Like you said, God gives us the Grace, how we use it is our choice. I can't do to much from home. I'm blessed though.

So much is happening the #TrumpChaos is a roller-coaster.   Why Louis Gohmert has filed a weird lawsuit against Mike Pence  https://t.co/cHYMlQvhmm
1343937986380095490 2020-12-29 23:12:39 +0800 <Jefiner68> @FlintGooch13 I got sick of saying all that. It's all part of the parable.  Why repeat it when everyone is aware of it. Even other religions follow thr same moral code, they just believe in other ways of getting to heaven.  Religions are cults. I'm Catholic laity w long tree of clergy 😥 👁🙈

They are all connected. Disconnecting the facts doesn't change them.  #BlackLivesMatter is more than a 3-word tag line.

That's the problem. Ppl need to quit chipping away at the shell and get to the core of the issue. Lobbyists are making money of death.

It's very sad that our country is in such shambles with a race war during an era with so much technology. We the people, all races together, have to end RACISM to be prosperous.
1343021489268908032 2020-12-27 10:30:49 +0800 <Jefiner68> @TimEdwardsZero4 I was just wondering why a Terrorist Notification didn't go out!  National Terrorism Advisory System. HHS isn't doing a very good job. I can't find anything but the HHS page.   Crazy! Domestic Terrorism should be on that system. I don't recall any alerts since Trump...

1337524545620758529 2020-12-12 06:27:56 +0800 <Jefiner68> Utterly amazing the abuse of our judicial system!  He has been making a mockery of the highest courts in the system and they haven't stopped him.  The precedent has already been set, enact the #25thAmendmentBeforeWeAllDie!!

1337478076280737792 2020-12-12 03:23:17 +0800 <Jefiner68> @phillyroni @Road_trippn You're probably too young, but back in the 1980s, RUSSIA had food lines because they had poor leadership. Trump learned from Putin which merely proves, RUSSIA still has poor leadership that leaked into #USA. IMO. I  could be wrong,  but it sure does feel like I'm right.

That didn't work so he has to be an anarchist to try the #BullyInChief plan.  He's using the same playbook that Mussolini &amp; Hitler &amp; every former anarchist leader.  This is #USA though.

The past 3 yrs trump has been campaigning for a 2nd term. Nothing accomplished but 300k dead from Covid-19.   A $1200 check 9 months ago? Highest-rated unemployment?

When i saw RUN DMC, they opened for Kid Rock who opened for Aerosmith. I saw Aerosmith 3x. Front row. I knew people in high-low 😂 places... Outlaws MC were body guards.

1334255586205196292 2020-12-03 05:58:15 +0800 <Jefiner68> Can trump get any more embarrassing? He really needs to stop being Spankyband take care of the Covid-19 crisis. If he's not going to president, he needs to resign from the oval office.  I like presidents that endorse aid for #WTP rather that whine and fuss like a baby.

He's not living in the past that doesn't match the present. We are all God's children and some cultures aren't Christian. That's their business. They still worship God. One God, indivisible. Fine with God, fine with me.
1333444459355365377 2020-12-01 00:15:07 +0800 <Jefiner68> @SDK21597925 @davidual Me too. Between Advent until Pentecost, I normally go to church no less than 3 times a week. Daily if possible. I know as well as all real Christians do, God expects us to think morally and logically.   Also, we are more civilized now, therefore parables change meaning not moral.
1333431571932729344 2020-11-30 23:23:55 +0800 <Jefiner68> @m_warmath1 @MSNBC That's what makes me so mad. I had a cabby tell me he's a History buff and then argue with me about Hitler. Like Hitler wasn't so bad. I was mortified.   Dangerous minds.

My Cousin was President of Marquette U from mid 60s to late 80s. He was a Jesuit priest. Father Raynor. He passed in 1998. His funeral was the biggest I've ever seen.

1333429232098217984 2020-11-30 23:14:37 +0800 <Jefiner68> @m_warmath1 @MSNBC The fact that trump has propagated his views his entire life and called the media the enemy is one way he has so many fooled.  His playbook has been used my every tyrant leader in history. It's hard to believe so many think he is telling the truth and have no clue.
1333427929422950401 2020-11-30 23:09:26 +0800 <Jefiner68> @m_warmath1 @MSNBC I agree. There's so many issues. Mostlycultural.   Education is fundamental in getting people to accept others idea's and goals.  I'm still reeling in my extended family saying I live off their SS. Factory workers with little education. Ignorant hicks if I may.

All I have is that the world is a better place with you in it. I had a complete hysterectomy when I was 47, I didn't want it, but the fibroid tumors were unbearable.  Never give up! You are beautiful.

They are modern-day American terrorists.   The 1st Amendment has limitations in the constitution.  This is where the Rittenhouses of this country grow.  https://t.co/RpcXDQiqAB

He may have undermined the faith in #DEMOCRACY for generations to come.  We can't stop a speeding train from hitting the wall of doubt.  Trump has ruined some #Americans with his lies, forevermore.

1325620136691240960 2020-11-09 10:04:04 +0800 <Jefiner68> I'm confused. Why would such a conceded person not concede? If he was to concede he could, should, and would feed his gigantic ego. (a little Seussy..)  It really doesn't matter whether he concedes anymore. 1974 law states he has to participate in a transition process.

I watched an eagle fly over my house yesterday and connected it to #PresidentBiden 💙💙  It was my message from the heavens that God is here with us. Weird how these symbols are so coincidental with life.  Just more conflict for the my brain 😄

1325440245157027841 2020-11-08 22:09:14 +0800 <Jefiner68> My friend, born in England,  raised in USA, was deported and cannot ever return. That was for drug charges.   He wasn't terrorizing the masses, killing citizens, or stealing. He belonged to a biker gang, though.  So, now, I would like to see all the real terrorists get deported.

Grief never goes away, you learn to live with it.   It makes a person stronger to deal with things they never thought possible!  4 instance, 4 years of Spanky isn't worse than the grief.

Look at McTreason's hands. 30 WH staffers have had or newly have it.  If they don't pass away, they will feel the effects of Covid-19, long after. HA

The one trump fan says, "but he's a pedophile." I SCREAMED that trump is a rapist and charged for it. I proceeded to call her retarded and went back imside.

I'm not at thr least bit suprised. Trump needs to win his home state for his ego.   I'm just praying for the justice system to work. Spanky hasn't won.

I had all intentions of moving back 11/2020 then the #COVIDIOTS took over.  So, next year. If you go back, look me up if ya want. I will be moving back near Gurnee, not far from 6-Flags Great America.

I got my crown, finally, after having a messed up front tooth root canal 5 years ago.   I got my crooked smile back!  I'm grateful for the dentist.   No buck teeth anymore 😉  https://t.co/fdNgIti76P

My clerk was my witness signer so it's received and will be counted. Anyone left with an absentee ballot should deliver their vote to the clerk or vote in person. Pass it on. 🗳😁

1321447846604951552 2020-10-28 21:44:52 +0800 <Jefiner68> @DNCWarRoom Reminds me when I was on the talk show "Judge for Yourself." When I got back to Milwaukee Airport, I didn't have a ride &amp; it was cold out. It was a red-eye flight, so I was exhausted &amp; fell asleep on a concrete bench outside for 2 hours B4 picked up. I looked like I was homeless.

They think he's to progressive.   I feel these are the people that want to live in a theocracy. Oppressed and oppressor.   Not enough people understand religion they just do it.

Something about not being able to federally charge a sitting president...  The Gop Senate, and a criminal administration. He placed people strategically throughout the justice system.
1321235762860445697 2020-10-28 07:42:07 +0800 <Jefiner68> Did you catch that he says [not really] immediately afterward, softly?  He's a fast-talking con artist that we are about to send to jail.

He rolled back our Healthcare system just for this reason, so when they rolled out this virus there would be no way to stop it.  Get a clue?

I'm afraid of Spanky's cronies, they've already killed a sitting judge's son.   I couldn't imagine racism this bad in our era! I really thought we were moving beyond the stigma.

Robbery, drugs, and the system got them and they are dead now from ODs. 36, 44, 57. I have a lot of respect for recovering addicts. Much addiction is caused by mental health.

I like the "treat the mental health" plan, a lot.   If they don't they need to change the name from DOC to DOD, department of death. If they stalk a person after they serve their time, what chance does the person have?

They grouped all other faiths as the enemy of God.   Many don't listen beyond what the bible says, but that is closed-minded. I hope someday religion is not the reason for war.

His crucifixion was meant to be a lesson from God. He came to show us he has humanity. It's the parishioners that twisted the story and the faith. Man has it twisted in America. IMO

It's the parishioners that have twisted the word, the way spanky does, that screwed it up. Get rid of Spanky and we get rid of bigotry.  https://t.co/9JOwM8E2nC

1318991121494757382 2020-10-22 03:02:43 +0800 <Jefiner68> At the advent of #BlackLivesMatter, the police tried to hijack #BLM. Trump ran for office, cheated, and won.  The coincidences run really deep in the web of lies constructed by the GOP.
1318991120467189765 2020-10-22 03:02:43 +0800 <Jefiner68> Also, Kyle Rittenhouse is from Antioch which is butted up against Antioch. Lake County isn't charging him cause the gun was housed and registered in Kenosha.  All of these towns in this area are under Judge Amy Coney Barrett's jurisdiction.
1318991119401836554 2020-10-22 03:02:43 +0800 <Jefiner68> So, it seems like the wife and son are just gonna walk free, the IL taxpayers are gonna eat the 300k and Fox Lake will remain marred by fate.  Police corruption runs as deep as the roots of the town.  It's not like I grew up there or anything!
1318991118332235782 2020-10-22 03:02:42 +0800 <Jefiner68> It doesn't absolve him from his crimes, but now it's God's judgment what to do with him. I almost feel like it was a trade-off.  Anyway, do you remember the cop shot in Texas, like the day after?   Also, they spent like $300,000 in 1.5 days chasing shadows? [they are terrorists]
1318991117048795141 2020-10-22 03:02:42 +0800 <Jefiner68> She called me back 30 minutes later and told me Joe was dead and they think he was murdered. I freaked out for about a month before I looked into it myself. I still think this was his wife's and son's idea.  Anyway, I knew him, he saved my life 30 years earlier.
1318991114972614656 2020-10-22 03:02:42 +0800 <Jefiner68> Fox Lake, Il.  That day on Rte 12, I saw 2 men, 1 black, 1 white, sitting handcuffed in a drive. I was wondering what was going on. A few miles up the road a Special Crimes Unit was there so I called Joe to see what was going on, then called my sister...

1318974587296677888 2020-10-22 01:57:01 +0800 <Jefiner68> @EdKamen @PeggyStuart How else can you react?   People blame abused women for staying. Now the world understands what it's like to be an abused spouse/partner.  That's my reaction. That's not thr best, but our life molds our unconscious reaction.

1318968508215185412 2020-10-22 01:32:52 +0800 <Jefiner68> @donwinslow I started saying that to people years ago, like when uneducated people started screaming 😱 faux news.  They still don't understand what faux news is, #IdiotInChief defined it for them.  Trump's definition: Anything he says is faux 🙄 news.
1318966818799837187 2020-10-22 01:26:09 +0800 <Jefiner68> @MyBigRedTruck I think you left out that he has made us a prime target for a takeover from one of his Very Fine Communist Friends.

I uninstalled and reinstalled my android app on my phone, and later changed my password for Twitter.   I continued having a tough time until I changed my password.  This usually happens to me when Twitter does a system update.
1318701053844574214 2020-10-21 07:50:06 +0800 <Jefiner68> America should vote for #Biden who is really American and the #ManOfTheMoment.  Also, #TrumpHatesSeniors. If that's not enough for you to #VoteBiden, then you are also a criminal. A threat to society, much like #TrumpCrimeFamily.  https://t.co/7e1e9icYkc

I've only ever gotten one flu shot in my life and that was so I could go to NICU to see my friend's baby girl. 2008. I have never had the flu. I have bad ears and suffer enough with ear issues. However, if Fauci approves a vax for Covid-19 I will.

We found an important weak link in the change of #Resisters.

1314754376557355009 2020-10-10 10:27:24 +0800 <Jefiner68> @WhenWeAllVote @SHAQ This is an issue in America. Shaq, who kids and adults around the world look up to never voted? No wonder ppl think it's ok.  I'm glad he's voting, but darn I hope people understand it's their constitutional duty to #VOTE .  I learned it in 8th grade.
1314752760622059521 2020-10-10 10:20:59 +0800 <Jefiner68> @Badscoop26 @jvharris_1965 You said it twice, Brad.   Ground Hog Day, year.  Nothing of substance, beyond Covid-19, happened, so basically we stayed in 2019 with COVID, where it came from.  We are survivors!!
1314750595048312832 2020-10-10 10:12:23 +0800 <Jefiner68> Let's go back a few months to Herman Cain! I'll bet he'd beg to differ, too!  Or, how about the 36 people who work at the WH that have Covid19. Jeez, Louise!  Dems, just stay away from any Trumpers you know until after they pass a #COVID19 test!

What's even more exciting is that he will have something to do with the Biden Administration. Advisor, I hope.
1314743333974151169 2020-10-10 09:43:32 +0800 <Jefiner68> @thebr0keb0i He writing more fake laws to protect Spanky McDumbass!

1314736167666020353 2020-10-10 09:15:03 +0800 <Jefiner68> This fight over religion really has to stop. Judaism is one of the oldest religions known and people are still fighting.   Why can't we accept that we are different in culture and that's OKAY? #VOTE
1314735371071168513 2020-10-10 09:11:53 +0800 <Jefiner68> @professor_boat @BidenHarris4us @harrisonjaime @ResisterSis20 @B52Malmet @mmpadellan Absolutely! But this isn't only trumpism. This white supremacy thing has been going on for eons. That's what needs to be ended. They are worldwide.  Freedom gives them the right to be that way. There has to be a better answer.

1314714198983798784 2020-10-10 07:47:45 +0800 <Jefiner68> The Supreme Court will hear a case to gut the #ACA ONE WEEK after the election.   One known outcome: Millions of people will end up paying an average of $1,000/year for birth control.    #VoteProChoice  https://t.co/AYSezL25lk
1314710875408920576 2020-10-10 07:34:33 +0800 <Jefiner68> Not all, but many, people who make over 400k annual are giving #BidenHarris2020 bad raps on their tax plan!   He's going to reverse Spanky's cuts for Corps with common sense tax reform so the wealthiest pay their fair share. That sounds more American than what we currently have.

So we CAN be human and sin, however, not wilfully. Church involvement in Abortion rights, being political, is against our constitution. That also needs fixin.  Get the church out!!!!
1314699071093956608 2020-10-10 06:47:39 +0800 <Jefiner68> @PalmerReport He just wanted to infect .@harrisonjaime and his campaign. Don't we think there should be consequences for Lindsey Graham?

1313924403965628416 2020-10-08 03:29:24 +0800 <Jefiner68> So, I looked for this tweet yesterday and couldn't find it, and here it is today.   When trump was called out by the journalist with the British accent, I didn't think there were any words on the pages he had, just color graphs. I'd like to know if they fixed that tape, too.
1313923608180383746 2020-10-08 03:26:14 +0800 <Jefiner68> So, every time I read this article I find something else to be mad about.   Hillary is innocent and they've already proved colluding. If he needs to call it spying, case closed he's guilty.  https://t.co/4ejwI4rmmQ

Not even George Washington was as good a president as he was and they are really poor losers!  Take the women out! What about the stay at home dads we never hear about?

1312495690858131460 2020-10-04 04:52:12 +0800 <Jefiner68> The president may be in the ICU but don't forget he's not nice and he won't be nice again after and if he recovers.  I pray for his affliction on the earth to end during this time. I ask through Jesus Christ to save us from the devil if he can change the minds of his followers.
1312495116062355463 2020-10-04 04:49:55 +0800 <Jefiner68> Not to change the subject, but if the oil rigs are spilling a little bit of oil at a time, they are constantly harming the natural economy for the indigenous wildlife.   @MSNBC is about to talk about it.  https://t.co/KsBTatiloK

1312488292093292545 2020-10-04 04:22:48 +0800 <Jefiner68> BREAKING:  There is no vaccine for #COVID19, and if you get sick, go and be seen.  If his condition gets worse, #COVID19 will run its course.  We don't wish harm, and we don't want to alarm.  If #PenceHasCovid, this could end with charm.  #NancyPelosiForPres #25thAmendmentNow

1311681367088955392 2020-10-01 22:56:22 +0800 <Jefiner68> @Meidas_Wendy @mmpadellan My computer kept loosing connection to Twitter just now and I rebooted, seems fine now. I suppose it depends on where they are rolling out what updates. They are located in NJ.   So .@TwitterSupport what's going in?

1311680161289506817 2020-10-01 22:51:34 +0800 <Jefiner68> The operative word being "would." Women could tell him to shut up, he's just a bully, so why give him satisfaction.   I felt bad for Joe.The sec he stuttered Trump was there to pounce. Like the 2nd grade bully waiting to look up your dress and steal your lunch money! #TrumpChaos
1311678341431390208 2020-10-01 22:44:21 +0800 <Jefiner68> @ReesusP I felt bullied when I went back to church. But the church has become the people and not the bride of Jesus, as it is supposed to be. They don't understand what the word "Charity" means.  We're not a theocracy, we're a democracy. We can #BuildBackBetter once the Chump is gone!
1311675201151741952 2020-10-01 22:31:52 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JAS16AZ The child is a walking lie machine.   What's so sad is children are honest until the are taught to lie. Nurture vs. Nature.  My mom is trump like, but not quite as bad...lol  Her and I don't get along well. She lies too much and like Mary T, I don't trust anyone in my family 💯.

1311669320330739712 2020-10-01 22:08:30 +0800 <Jefiner68> My theory on why Trump and GOP dislike the Coumos.  They are so "good looking" that all the women in the suburbs are pining over their charisma!  I ❤ Cuomo Bros.  https://t.co/ul6vbHwVaZ

1311499348010831874 2020-10-01 10:53:05 +0800 <Jefiner68> @CharlesMBlow @KellyLWilliams I told some of my family that last fall and never spoke to them again. What get's me is my friends have multi-racial children and they still support Trump, but if anyone else was to say something about race, they are all over it.   Italian, non-practicing Catholics.
1311498377650221057 2020-10-01 10:49:14 +0800 <Jefiner68> @KellyLWilliams @SashaBeauloux Yippie, have you applied for your absentee ballot?
1311497942776328193 2020-10-01 10:47:30 +0800 <Jefiner68> @donwinslow I also thought I heard him call Antifa, gentlemen too. That means that he was not agreeing with Trump.
1311497214380969984 2020-10-01 10:44:37 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JoeBiden will help us #BuildBackBetter. We will have America back so we can grow again.  We can't allow racism back into our world.

1311490986137260033 2020-10-01 10:19:52 +0800 <Jefiner68> @Eiggam5955 @RBReich This is mostly Trump, but he drained the swamp to find the worst of the worst to carry his communist agenda this far. It's not only because of the nonvoters.   As we see now, some may not have been able to vote. Trump cheated, don't you think he's to blame?
1311490054364246017 2020-10-01 10:16:09 +0800 <Jefiner68> This is the blatant truth! We have a communist president that plays to GOP to get his claws in deeper.  #TrumpIsAClown but Justice Bader was a true American. Someone that did things by the rules to get our society to be one of the best on earth.  #RacistTrump kills America!
1311484356129705990 2020-10-01 09:53:31 +0800 <Jefiner68> @justmenmine @MarcWeinstein2 Yes, Yes, Yes.  They don't understand the Black Lives Matter statement. It means stop systemic racism. It covers all POC.   This is #TrumpsAmeriKKKa and if we don't vote him out, it will be for a much longer time than 4 more years. Mental illness will ravage the country.
1311482788563103745 2020-10-01 09:47:17 +0800 <Jefiner68> @wa_waters @MarcWeinstein2 Exactly.   I never heard of racewashing but I have been called a racist by a black supervisor because he thought my tattoo was a swastika.  It looks like a lightning ⚡ bolt. Almost exactly like the emoticon. He was mean, I ended up quitting.  But it happens. We need Diversity.

1311481388953202689 2020-10-01 09:41:43 +0800 <Jefiner68> @adc1100 It would be good if Trump would stop inciting his white supremacist groups to murder protesters and burn down cities...

This has to end and it's not going to under trump.  Biden will be fine. I stutter when I speak in public. He did just wonderful. I never even knew he stuttered until spanky picked on him about it. That ticks me off.
1311156404774940677 2020-09-30 12:10:21 +0800 <Jefiner68> Just so everyone understands, the election may not be called right away.  That shouldn't deter your vote. Keep your #vote plan, #VoteBlueDownBallot.  We will know before the end of Spanky's term.  #BidenWonTheDebates

1311143781966766080 2020-09-30 11:20:12 +0800 <Jefiner68> Wasn't it funny when Biden said he wasn't behind the New Green Deal?   Trump is really delusional. He argued that who question and #Biden2020 never got to fully answer except to say that he had his own plan.  If you want to check out his plan, go to 👇🏻 https://t.co/IMEZIivF8I

1311124912237678593 2020-09-30 10:05:13 +0800 <Jefiner68> So Trump accuses Biden of not saying "Law and Order" while he is the one that keeps inciting violence.  #RacistTrump is losing.  #BullyInChief is a grifter and cheater.  #VoteHimOut   #DemCastWI #LawAndOrder

1311112782499241984 2020-09-30 09:17:01 +0800 <Jefiner68> Trump doesn't understand how the debate works because he demands all of the attention.  If I were Biden, I would walk out if this continues. SMH.

I was wondering cause you said you helped your daughter with her homework. I'm not used to a dad helping unless they are a single parent.  As a Catholic liberal, I suppose the thought of children + kids = marriage. I don't judge others about that.

1310615909535485953 2020-09-29 00:22:37 +0800 <Jefiner68> I watched a program about "Robert Maxwell" a few nights ago. Yes, Ghislaine's dad, owner of Daily Mirror, member of parliment, and FRAUDSTER. Stealing from your employee's pension fund is as bad if not worse than stealing from a charity.  #EndCorruptionNow #JusticeMatters
1310614351628378112 2020-09-29 00:16:26 +0800 <Jefiner68> @mmpadellan The difference this time is, we have his number.   I just hope that Chris Wallace does his job and the last interview wasn't a plant.   I no longer feel like I'm on "Survivor."   Now, it feels for like "The Usual Suspects." or "The Sopranos." SMH
1310613094272512001 2020-09-29 00:11:26 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JasonOverstreet @mmpadellan On top of that, they used an algorithm to suppress as many voters in 2016. Imagine that!!! So, we have a killer president and he's been grifting us for 4 years and expects to be re-elected.  He should be disqualified for the election, period.

1309916597826527238 2020-09-27 02:03:48 +0800 <Jefiner68> Catholocism is about the Holy Trinity, Mary, &amp; prayer. You live a life like you think Jesus would.   If you sin you confess. It's not difficult.   You can't be Catholic &amp; not go to the Sacrament of Reconciliation.  This isn't about Catholicism, it's about #PsychoTrump.  Wake up!!

He, like many in the government, had no right to be there.  The GOP voters have no idea who &amp; what they vote for, they only vote for the party. A Socialist Party, which is very much unlike socialized medicine.

Many get on the lists and create #Chaos by attacking other's personalities, ie.  That's not what we are here for. If you can't build up your neighbor, go away.  We can take away from this experience. We can block IRL, too.

Amendments are made to the Bible via papal letters, etc to serve the people of the era.  The Constitution still serves White Supremacist Leaders.   RECOMMENDING.

1308033844554203140 2020-09-21 21:22:25 +0800 <Jefiner68> @Eblingmis2 Trump is hell on earth.

So, she drove up, was in contact with strangers and possibly exposed everyone. She's 80 so nobody said anything. Narcissistic people don't actually think about others.   We have another year of this, so hunker down.
1308031073755058179 2020-09-21 21:11:24 +0800 <Jefiner68> Agreed

1308029317172146176 2020-09-21 21:04:25 +0800 <Jefiner68> @flinthaven So, I guess his new job will be Forest Rakers.   Oh, wait, it must be a thing in Forest Nations. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1308025959623385089 2020-09-21 20:51:05 +0800 <Jefiner68> Happy 😊 Monday!!  My questions of the day are this. Why haven't we heard from anyone about the hospital situation?  Why are we losing lives at such a high clip without holding the President accountable?  Shut the country down. #MondayMorning  #MondayThought

1308022981134778369 2020-09-21 20:39:15 +0800 <Jefiner68> @atrupar Maybe he's thinking about the movie Chiraq? Different nations, but the same idiocy. He's attempting to turn America into a Terrorist Natiin.  That's the connection.
1308022318673911808 2020-09-21 20:36:37 +0800 <Jefiner68> @atrupar Interesting, ideologue is a word I've never heard, but if it means the same as idiocy, I'm sure it will do.  Like doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome.
1308021338628599808 2020-09-21 20:32:43 +0800 <Jefiner68> If this jackass was to get another teem, I see issues with water becoming a thing! Not toilet water, either!

For me, it was realizing that we've been going backward in our fight against Racism. I guess #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd woke many, but also, #RIPJohnLewis, and even more with #RIPRBG.

We are being racked over the coals of communist propaganda. Worst than Hitler's. I don't have a backup on that statement, other than the 22,000+ lies that come directly from Spanky's mouth!
1307714933535248385 2020-09-21 00:15:10 +0800 <Jefiner68> @mmpadellan I can say that I was able to get 3 people I know from IBEW Union in Jacksonville to understand that this is pure propaganda. That means that their friends know too &amp; so on.  We need to argue the facts &amp; not Spanky's lies.  Just think how soon it will be that Spanky will be sa'ad.

Men (not all) are swine. Some women are, also...  The bible was written by men, not women.  Okay, Daffodi12, your avatar is adorable!!
1307558030519787520 2020-09-20 13:51:42 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JoeTalkShow You are truly ignorant and without enough intelligence to think straight.  Go to drug rehab and stop drinking alcohol, you're losing brain cells.
1307557413286023175 2020-09-20 13:49:15 +0800 <Jefiner68> Blasphemy, I say.  I'm so sick of their crap. Now the Pope is too. I knew God was going to say something before he strikes.   He always has. Shall we call this our warning?  Every part of the bible speaks down of what these people are doing by worshiping Trump. They'll see. 🙏

The Vatican isn't getting involved with Politics, you idiot!  (God forgive me for calling him names. I have truly tried everything else.) 🤪🤣🤣🤣🤣   Secretary #Pompusseo!!
1307552684233424897 2020-09-20 13:30:27 +0800 <Jefiner68> @SecPompeo Dear @SecPompeo I have a prayer for you.  God help this man from burning in hell for eternity. If it is your will.  Myself, I wish he'd start burning now. I will say my Hail Mary's now.
1307549039622320128 2020-09-20 13:15:58 +0800 <Jefiner68> I will suffer for many years because I was nearly killed by my ex-boyfriend. They charged him with Attempted Murder, but his RICO Lawyers got him off. He would have been a 3-time loser.  The court was much like the kangaroo court we see with Trump. RICO Act needs to be stronger.

1307042813859835906 2020-09-19 03:44:25 +0800 <Jefiner68> The United States acting president, aka #LiarInChief, is playing the blame game and I'm vomiting.  However, he actually did dis-blame #Biden2020, as he blamed him for the manufacturing trade issues in America. "It was long before," he says.  He then calls absentee voting a scam!

He kills, he maims, he demoralizes so he can kill America!  Delusion has brought him to believe he's the supreme leader, but Jesus is the supreme leader, not Trump!  #RemoveTrump

1304501543924887553 2020-09-12 03:26:19 +0800 <Jefiner68> Also, given the fact that a #TrumpCrimesCommission will be needed, I predict the facts of the evidence will speak for themselves.  However, I highly doubt there will be enough time in 2021 to fully present the proof. The crimes are so many, we need sufficient time to procecute.

This is the moment to imagine and build a new American economy for our families and the next generation. #DemCastWI  https://t.co/ljhvu6PiNw

I tell the story every time I see someone text and drive.   BF driving to pick up GF and they're texting. In reply to her text, he ran her ass over in the parking lot!

If Obama acted one iota of how Spanky acts, he wouldn't have been PRESIDENTIAL enough to be elected twice.  Spanky is exacting revenge because we'd made him endure having a black man for pres.

All the bibles are slightly different but hold the same versus.  The KJV is different from NAB.  Their doctrine is skewed IMO.

He kills American troops by ignoring the intelligence because he SPOKE to PUTIN who said he didn't do it.  Question:  If your home was robbed by your neighbor and you watched, would you accept him saying he didn't do it?
1301653462619389958 2020-09-04 06:49:03 +0800 <Jefiner68> #ViolentTrump is still enticing teenagers to break the law.  IMO, that Junior in South Miami-Dade disabled the system so kids are forced to return to school with #Covid_19.  They have the ability with #ComputerForensics to do more than they've done already.

1301568667927359491 2020-09-04 01:12:07 +0800 <Jefiner68> The only reason they are pushing this is because Trump is the one who broke it!!  If you want to see this country remain the #USA, you'll plan your vote, vote early, and verify the clerk has received your vote in their office.  This is a logical solution to #TrumpChaos!

1301435640567992320 2020-09-03 16:23:30 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon I think she was born that way.
1301435402167910402 2020-09-03 16:22:34 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon My step brother was the first in 1983 by car accident.   Then my step mom passed dec 99, cancer, my bro overdosed a month later on vicodin and sima.  9 years later my next bro died from drug od. He lived a week after they accidentally gave him wrong med in ER. Last one was cancer
1301434306406084611 2020-09-03 16:18:12 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon Her name was kallie when I adopted them. Wilma was 6 and Freddie 6 mo. I decided I couldn't change wilmas and Freddie caught on. Hence the Flintstones...hehe  Hanz was beautiful handsome.
1301433278029869056 2020-09-03 16:14:07 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon She is seal  tip siamese and tabby mix.
1301432879235436544 2020-09-03 16:12:32 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon Was he shorter? Freddie is my shorty cat. She's not a mini but she's a  hubby little runt and has a slightly deformed leg. But she is my sweetheart. She's a kissie face...
1301432099669508098 2020-09-03 16:09:26 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon That's beautiful!
1301431766876553218 2020-09-03 16:08:07 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon She has feline herpes and she's reLly skiddish. But they really both are. I had to drug wilma to get her i. The truck when we moved from GA to WI. That is a story for another time though.
1301429782886965248 2020-09-03 16:00:14 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon 😄   DM me tomorrow? Well talk privately, okay.   Dms give more space to type too.
1301429187404857345 2020-09-03 15:57:52 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon Yeah, I wanted to kill my siblings. It was like he died again.  I'm the oldest of 3 but with step sisbro there's 11 of us. 4 are dead now. I have 3 step sisters, a half brother, and a blood sister still alive and only text my brother a cpl times a year.

1301427586891948032 2020-09-03 15:51:30 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon Well, I'm sure I just overwhelmed her.   She ended up working in administration.
1301427317563101184 2020-09-03 15:50:26 +0800 <Jefiner68> @NovaKathleen My granny invested in Abbot Labs in the 1900s and she made a pretty penny.
1301426546197094401 2020-09-03 15:47:22 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon My mom still smokes.
1301426319859867648 2020-09-03 15:46:28 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon Yeah they scared me by telling me I had money and I was lying. That was about the time that my dad passed away.  I talked to my dad 2 wks b4 he passed. My sis had poa and never told me my dad was sick. What they told me &amp; how he died are different stories.   I'm falling to 💤 😴
1301425281916456960 2020-09-03 15:42:21 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon To not get married bc my mom thinks I should...therefore I'm single on a perpetual path. But im okay with that now. My cats live me so much and me them. They are perfect company.  They're the Flintstones, Freddie &amp; Wilma. Both females. Freddie was born on my bday, 49 years apart.
1301423472405614593 2020-09-03 15:35:09 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon I think I made one of my therapist depressed...😆
1301423108914647040 2020-09-03 15:33:43 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon She turned 80 this year and has started having small heart attacks after my oldest bro past a 3 years ago. I didn't talk to her for a full 16 mo.  When I found out I have Epilepsy I called.  Then when I told her I have always had Epilepsy she told me no I didn't, I hung up. SMH
1301421251517444096 2020-09-03 15:26:20 +0800 <Jefiner68> @NovaKathleen Well, we aren't doing it. I feel sorry for anyone that actually falls for it.  One of my uncles invested in a pharma vax research in FL...SMH  He's a never Trumper too.
1301420561105551360 2020-09-03 15:23:35 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon I went to a meeting in Orlando when he was down and I lived in FL. They literally told me I had to give them money or I couldn't leave and I started crying really loud and made a huge scene.  We were at a hotel conference room. I have only seen him 2x in last
1301419716364382209 2020-09-03 15:20:14 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon My dad was married 3 times. WTF catholic shitbos that? 😆 I found a picture of a toddler in my dad's pictures who looks very much like me and her first is the same as mine and the middle is same as my sister's.I found all this out doing my genealogy. I did background  ✔'s too 🤣
1301418477673156609 2020-09-03 15:15:18 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon My mom used to tell me I'm codependent and I threw it back in her face one day and she never said it again. I'm on a curve when it comes to figuring things out if it's not obvious. I'm just happy I figured her out b4 I was dead.
1301417446327418882 2020-09-03 15:11:13 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon Your an artist, I noted, after you told me it's your mom.  Art helps me alot. Writing ✍ too!
1301416836349784064 2020-09-03 15:08:47 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon My mother is a pill head &amp; alcoholic. Her grandpa owned a whore house in the town live, in the 40/50s...  I'm sure she was raped and never took care of it, mentally.   Its that age group. My friend Kelly thinks the mind set of that generation won't change until they die off.
1301415007926747138 2020-09-03 15:01:31 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon Yep. I had to tell my mother to stop giving me health advice  she's not a doctor. If she was worried about be at the time I was injured, I w/n be disabled.  I just deal with it and make damn sure she holds up to her $ agreement. 8 yrs ago my sis wanted to rent an apt for me. smh
1301413259405385728 2020-09-03 14:54:34 +0800 <Jefiner68> @Matkin72 Hahahaha! If Germany were b to send us one, I'd take that to.
1301412914079899648 2020-09-03 14:53:12 +0800 <Jefiner68> @NovaKathleen That's Fauci's exact words and we won't be clear if there is one until the end of next year.  This is trumps agenda.
1301412126934937601 2020-09-03 14:50:04 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon Oh yeah, my uncle is Avatar which is an off shoot of Scientilogy. My mom was Baptised at 17yo cause she got pregnant at 16...lol. She put him up for adoption.   I probably have a normal sibling out there somewhere.  😆
1301411363986829313 2020-09-03 14:47:02 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon You're lucky to have him.  Ny mom was married 4 times and my relationship intellect is pretty much non existent. I've already been married 2x. I've been divorced 19 though.
1301410669015838722 2020-09-03 14:44:17 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon Did you feel like Mary Trump was telling your story? I sure do.  I'm writing a book, eventually. Holy shit, I went through so many therapists bc they couldn't deal whit my back story.  So you must have issue with food. I do, I don't eat unless I smoke weed or force myself.
1301409674294632449 2020-09-03 14:40:20 +0800 <Jefiner68> @Shawnee_Leath Yep! I have TBI and Epilepsy. I always forget names and words.   Doctors compared my TBI to a stroke. I had a left side contusion with coma for 11 days that left me lt side partial paralysis, but ok now.  Now we know I have 2 TBIs. They didn't know alot abt it in the 1980s.
1301408383426232320 2020-09-03 14:35:12 +0800 <Jefiner68> @dragonflei Nope
1301408321447047170 2020-09-03 14:34:57 +0800 <Jefiner68> No way, would you?
1301407815857328130 2020-09-03 14:32:56 +0800 <Jefiner68> @Edwardlittledd1 There should have been a recount, period.
1301407569043501056 2020-09-03 14:31:58 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon We're young enough to do it, too! Im 52.  When I had to have brain surgery in 2015, my mom drove me for my pre surgery appointment.  She literally would not let the doctor talk to me because she had to have attention and said as much.  They won't change bc they can't.
1301406271774523394 2020-09-03 14:26:48 +0800 <Jefiner68> @Edwardlittledd1 That's what I thought, thanks 😊
1301406009127247872 2020-09-03 14:25:46 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon Are we related 🤔 🤣🤣🤣🤣🙃
1301405847785025537 2020-09-03 14:25:07 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon Yep. I actually got ahold of that by meditation. It took me 34 years. I did counseling for 5 years and said it wasn't working, I went back to church more regularly, prayed, and suddenly I quit having nightmares every night. I have Epilepsy too.
1301404613594226688 2020-09-03 14:20:13 +0800 <Jefiner68> @PamAnde29517684 Probably. It's already been reported that Russians are pretty much doing the exact same thing they did in 2016. SMH  I just figured, what would make Fox be any different?
1301404076970774529 2020-09-03 14:18:05 +0800 <Jefiner68> @LabrooyShaun 12 years ago I was involved with the Outlaws. Dated an associate. What they do to children isn't even cool!  They grow up to be a threat to society like their parents.  Yes, it's horrible.
1301403459783217153 2020-09-03 14:15:38 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon I'm sorry, regardless of how we show I t on the outside, it still hurts on the inside!
1301403132224774144 2020-09-03 14:14:20 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon No shit! I want to sue my sister but I can find a lawyer that will take the case. I found the bank the inheritance is in and I have pictures of the will! My younger brother effed me over at the lawyer's that wrote the will and that guy has retired.   I didn't find out for 9 years
1301402400092291076 2020-09-03 14:11:25 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon Every time he opens his mouth! I'm pretty good at controlling my feelings after 3 years of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy before he ran.  It's a wonderful therapy that was developed by Marsha Linehan. It helps you to view trauma in a different light.
1301397385818632193 2020-09-03 13:51:30 +0800 <Jefiner68> @LabrooyShaun Aren't they a Biker Club with a Rocker on their vest?  If so, that would connect them to either the Hells Angels or Outlaws.   The RICO Act is supposed to stop their shit!   No better than a street gang.

1301383186841325569 2020-09-03 12:55:04 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon Don't know but my nephew lives an hour north and her cousin lives an hour south, so I'll be safe.  I'll tell her to leave and she knows it.  I have been confronting her lies pretty consistently and she no longer calls daily.   Thats what the news should be doing w trump, too.

1301379929888690179 2020-09-03 12:42:08 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon The money she took was to buy Cocaine to sell back in the 80s when she was hob nobbing with trump in WPB and Indiana. Doing runs from Florida to Chicago monthly!  I really hate trump!
1301379390782275586 2020-09-03 12:39:59 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon My mom helped my sister steal my inheritance, I believe so I would be dependent on her. I only call her when I need money 💰   She stole my car accident money after I was comatose for 11 days. She then never did what she was supposed to after two months of physical therapy.   1/2

1301376089105760257 2020-09-03 12:26:52 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon Because she's crazy and doesn't care about covid.  She doesn't like trump though. So I can handle a few days. I live in a townhouse so there are places to get away from her.  She lives in Georgia and has visitors all the time. She's at my uncles house in Chicago, 4 hrs.away.
1301374865245700098 2020-09-03 12:22:00 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon Did they ever throw you in adult health and then come and visit daily and start a fight with you?  My mom tried it twice and the second time she succeeded because I have TBI not mental health! 10 days and I fucking can't hardly speak to her.
1301373838618488834 2020-09-03 12:17:56 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon problem., we are the blacksheep of thr family, that's bad when there's only one good person in a family that size.
1301373172877594629 2020-09-03 12:15:17 +0800 <Jefiner68> @AceHoffman @glennkirschner2 No prob.
1301373088601452544 2020-09-03 12:14:57 +0800 <Jefiner68> @RealBitchIsBack Darn girl! I have bulging disks in my neck and because a spur formed and is sitting on C4-C6 I can barely turn my head without pain. The location of the spur makes it impossible to operate on.  Sorry you're suffering.
1301372060795465729 2020-09-03 12:10:52 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JohnstonSharon Omg that's my mom!!  I was beginning to think im the only person with experience with narcs.  My moms coming to visit and I've told her not to, but she's coming anyways..  The last time I saw her was about 2 years ago and I told her to leave before I got back home from doc.
1301370950093623296 2020-09-03 12:06:27 +0800 <Jefiner68> @JCfromVancity Oh definitely. I was worried that if he killed himself we'd never get justice for the abuse we've endured.

But I'm not so sure he could do jail time. I wonder if the GOP will have him taken out if they feel threatened by him rolling. Like Epstien.

1301352015621222401 2020-09-03 10:51:13 +0800 <Jefiner68> If they do send in 2, give them an astronomical fine!
1301352014300041216 2020-09-03 10:51:12 +0800 <Jefiner68> Even if people were to send in 2 ballots they would be caught! WI send me 2 for the Aug. primary. I voted on one and delivered them both back to the clerk myself.  It would be Trumps base that votes twice. Maybe a bill passed before elections making it illegal would curb it.
1301348741979484160 2020-09-03 10:38:12 +0800 <Jefiner68> @morethanmySLE This is awesome! This is a great lesson of in inclusion of every human!

1301343847583285249 2020-09-03 10:18:45 +0800 <Jefiner68> @RedTRaccoon @morethanmySLE What do you mean they don't have people with disabilities in Russia?  What do they do, terminate them if they don't have 10 finger and toes or birth defects when born? What if they have an amputation or brain aneurysm as they are aging?  I will watch this when I get Netflix.
1301341917171650561 2020-09-03 10:11:05 +0800 <Jefiner68> @morethanmySLE It took me 30 years to accept that I have brain damage due to TBI.  That was detrimental to my health bc now I have issues it didn't need to have.  Denial is never safe, but it's a human characteristic.

1301334515785314304 2020-09-03 09:41:40 +0800 <Jefiner68> Do narcissists commit suicide?   If Hitler's suicide is true, I was thinking maybe Spanky will do the same.  I'm not condoning suicide! Suicide is never the way to fix issue.   My question comes from knowledge of the mentally ill having a higher death rate from suicide.

There's no reason to vote for a traitor because we aren't safe #InTrumpAmerica!  #BlackLivesMatter

Maybe together we can come up with a campaign to show how the devils truth is backwards movement, while Jesus's truth is forward movement.

I very much don't like sexualizing music, but that doesn't make me a bad person.   We all have a story that makes us who we are. I feel they are feeding into the sexualizing women narrative instead of making us human.

1300944794546565123 2020-09-02 07:53:04 +0800 <Jefiner68> #InTrumpsAmerica, Mike Pence is important, but we already know he doesn't care about anyone but faux Christians!  He failed the AIDS crisis in Indiana and was given the seat of VPOTUS. He's just furthering Trump's agenda to kill off all the Dems!  Worse, his base is killing us!
1300943642631245824 2020-09-02 07:48:29 +0800 <Jefiner68> If we all dress up that way, the Dems kids will get more candy!! Actually, I wouldn't even consider trick-or-treating this year, It seems to be all trickery!!

1300856177299947520 2020-09-02 02:00:56 +0800 <Jefiner68> @Autumn43616 @atrupar We learn from each other, that is just the way it is. We can't change it. I always hate to admit it, but I've learned to get these narc out of my life since 2017.  I actually unwillingly prepared myself for Spanky to be president.   I've let my guard down twice and got fvucked.
1300853863742926848 2020-09-02 01:51:44 +0800 <Jefiner68> Do I believe this will piss of .@realDonaldTrump more than calling him an Orange Fake?  Yes, yes I do!

1300788588737630209 2020-09-01 21:32:21 +0800 <Jefiner68> The president's visit to Kenosha WI today is nothing less than a campaign stunt.  He's not speaking towards #JusticeForJacobBlake or the men who were murdered by Kyle Rittenhouse.  So why is he coming? Yet another campaign? WI people need to open their eyes and #VoteBidenHarris.
1300784665704488961 2020-09-01 21:16:46 +0800 <Jefiner68> Trump never conceals his racism and misogyny. He lies and they accept it.

1300602824917749761 2020-09-01 09:14:12 +0800 <Jefiner68> @SpiralLeaf @KaiMerrick1 I'd be in thr mild group. Thr one in my left eye was about to blow, ble twice and never popped. Had surgery within a month. My step aunt had one pop and she's in bad shape.
1300601971448176643 2020-09-01 09:10:48 +0800 <Jefiner68> @TheMexipert @RepJayapal Me too!

1300601752828416008 2020-09-01 09:09:56 +0800 <Jefiner68> @SherylAnnMurphy Sorry!
1300601629616615426 2020-09-01 09:09:27 +0800 <Jefiner68> @KaiMerrick1 I have frontal lobe damage and opthalmic aneurysms. I can see my decline and hes nearly 30 years older, so his will go faster.  He's always been a cuckoo, but now he's just wrecking the country!
1300599801151737862 2020-09-01 09:02:11 +0800 <Jefiner68> @Putin_t_Rump 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1300599707736121344 2020-09-01 09:01:48 +0800 <Jefiner68> @Putin_t_Rump 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1300599591813996544 2020-09-01 09:01:21 +0800 <Jefiner68> @KaiMerrick1 That's why he appears to have aphasia! I have TBI, Aneuryms, one stent, and aphasia! I have a feeling that's his difficulty with speaking and reading. If Aneurysms, depending, he would have non-invasive brain surgery, like me. I think his 1st was 2018.  https://t.co/22SyBixHE7.
1300597678426984449 2020-09-01 08:53:45 +0800 <Jefiner68> @Eblingmis2 I'm an aneurysm carrier also! Have Epilepsy, too. I'm not afraid to admit it, even though there is stigma! With my TBI I have aphasia and recognize that in trump also!   https://t.co/22SyBixHE7.
1300596480479244289 2020-09-01 08:48:59 +0800 <Jefiner68> @SherylAnnMurphy He's a madman! #TrumpChaos is difficult to keep up with!

1300592636194099208 2020-09-01 08:33:42 +0800 <Jefiner68> @Guantaio @mimi_elder We'll be dancing, dancing in the street.
1300592243116515328 2020-09-01 08:32:09 +0800 <Jefiner68> @Putin_t_Rump TrumpPutin is probably medically insane.   I was thinking he's od'ing on his favorite chopped up drug of the day!
1300591150718484480 2020-09-01 08:27:48 +0800 <Jefiner68> @jasonfechner @atrupar NBC has a detailed video of it on youtube.
1300590732038856704 2020-09-01 08:26:08 +0800 <Jefiner68> @kirkacevedo @SimonMetcalfe6 And there you have it, a photo of President Biden in one take! A photo of #MafiaDon's head needs to be airbrushed over and over to hide the horned presence!!
1300588521313492997 2020-09-01 08:17:21 +0800 <Jefiner68> @Eblingmis2 He is an aneurysm!
1300588105511075848 2020-09-01 08:15:42 +0800 <Jefiner68> @Putin_t_Rump He had that leg swing a few months back if I remember correctly. He also had something in 2018. Who knows, but if he has dementia or Alzheimers we are suffering their lies!  Af you've ever known someone with either, you would understand what I mean.  They go backward in time!
1300586857210753029 2020-09-01 08:10:45 +0800 <Jefiner68> @Scotty_thoughts @DNCWarRoom We are getting there. It's pretty obvious, there are more of us than them!
1300586479274651649 2020-09-01 08:09:15 +0800 <Jefiner68> @TeaPainUSA That picture makes it look like he's about to lock face with his VP...lol
1300586165687529472 2020-09-01 08:08:00 +0800 <Jefiner68> So, did trump have a stroke? The news is so vague!
1300585823650357257 2020-09-01 08:06:38 +0800 <Jefiner68> It's fun to see young parishioners ready the day's scriptures during Mass.  It's not fun watching the American President deliver a speech like a 2nd grader just learning to read!   https://t.co/972TiDgdCq
1300584975398580224 2020-09-01 08:03:16 +0800 <Jefiner68> Says #MafiaDon himself, or tried to say, anyway!
1300584334290825217 2020-09-01 08:00:43 +0800 <Jefiner68> @truth_well #VoteBidenHarris and that won't be a problem anymore!!
