You’ll do it. 4 magical words that worked 4 me 10yrs ago was “I don’t want one“ every time I went 2 pick one up. I told my brain those 4 words. It worked 4 me. This year was HELL. You’re a power ranger for even trying.

They wouldn’t even know what to look for. Only employees know what to look for. Idiots simple and plain.

They have been told they have to ignore his crimes because he’s the chosen one and will deliver the people to a hitler regime. That’s why they voted for him.

1323796019386159105 2020-11-04 09:15:40 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @corren_love Because trump said a while ago. “Hire people without degrees because they have more experience” Yes, Experience is Golden as well.

1318994166702112770 2020-10-22 03:14:49 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> He knows that money is coming from citizens like me that want him and others like him Out Of Office. “Some of these shadowy figures out there running ads, is there any foreign influence afoot?” Graham asked.

1318981971645747202 2020-10-22 02:26:22 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> This is strange, it states... A Google ad urged people to “Enroll in Trumpcare plans.

1318975487734145024 2020-10-22 02:00:36 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> Mark Ronquetti is denouncing trump as the orange man before he decided to run. Now he is 100% trump. I think we got some mind changing going on here folks, for Money.

1318919964200476672 2020-10-21 22:19:58 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> Mark TRumpetti @MarkRonchettiNM doesn’t belong in New Mexico. He’s using New Mexicans forcing them to say they want a red state on his ads. Turning a beautiful BLUE state with massive culture and diversity into a red state will ruin us!  Wrong for New Mexico.
1318918870988619777 2020-10-21 22:15:37 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @DDDNM @benraylujan @MarkRonchettiNM handpicked by GOP. He fits the evangelical pitch, he’s an actor. He denied climate change, he has no plan. GOP are lining their pockets and he wants a piece. MARK IS NOT NEW MEXICO! He should quit embarrassing New Mexicans in his ads.

That was one of trumps big pet peeves and tRumpetti is only happy to oblige. Mark is not a New Mexican he is WRONG for NM.
1318719320030150656 2020-10-21 09:02:41 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @thebr0keb0i I’m sure Kid Rock would do his rallies but he would have to pay him. trump would much rather steal the music, in their face. I used to look up to ice cube, I’m so disappointed in him. 50 cent ahhhh.

1318652075056705536 2020-10-21 04:35:28 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> Pardon me Sir. Dr. Mirabal. I listened to your podcast with Charles Ashley III, very powerful. There wouldn’t be a Black Lives Matter if we didn’t think that all lives matter - Dr. Frank Mirabal folks!
1318633292716015616 2020-10-21 03:20:50 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @abqvista @MarkRonchettiNM Remember when he used to burp on camera, I had to change the Chanel, he was pretty gross. Probably why he’s running for office. That commercial ad with those beautiful Chicanos is embarrassing to watch. He used them like trump used Kanye.  https://t.co/vGjQlmEuGx
1318632114418536449 2020-10-21 03:16:09 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> Saying that he’s not a politician should disqualify him for a job he’s not qualified to do? Just saying.

1318630346599108608 2020-10-21 03:09:08 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> Mark is telling US here that he’s not qualified. He isn’t a politician. Look what we got in The Peoples House for hiring a non politician, an actor that is clearly NOT qualified to do this job? You are not fit for office Sir!
1318630316765007872 2020-10-21 03:09:01 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @MarkRonchettiNM Mark is telling US here that he’s not qualified. He isn’t a politician.

Mark is still all in with trump. Please ask yourself, Is Mark really going to be for us or for trump and money? I would have to say NO.

Hand picked to run because he’s on tv and they thought his acting would deliver a win.

Study your ballot before voting in person? No retainer judges on my ballot we’re Dem and that wasn’t on the ballot. had to research each.

Step 3: watch debate on fox entertainment channel. Step 4: wake next day, drink koolaid tune into fox. Step 4: tune in to Fox News next day to hear us tell you tRump won.

Pardon my rudeness but Mea Culpa podcast tells us nothing just chat sessions. Rosies interview started as eye opening then it went down hill from there. Nothing significant.

ONLY want to be publicly racist with no consequences. I’m confused with the non white supremacists that support him. Weak!

1309624397905276928 2020-09-26 06:42:42 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @LeonaLioness6 The first time I say it in my head to make sure it comes out better the second time.
1309623914767609857 2020-09-26 06:40:47 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @SaltySamIAm1 No, but I'm not 80 years old thinking $200 is alot. The thinking would be "I'm going to vote for him because he paid me. Nobody else has done that for me" its sad really. My 81 year old mom would say "que coma mierda este cabron".
1309620437702201344 2020-09-26 06:26:58 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @laxref12 Only the wealthy don't want health care for all. They feel that if you can't afford it, you shouldn't have it. Just like groceries.

1309603419934597127 2020-09-26 05:19:21 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @koan4u I don’t see it as rebranding. I see it as steeling it just like his Epstein wife stole First Lady Michelle Obamas speech and stole First Lady Jacqueline Kennedys garden. It’s what the tRumps do best. They are THIEVES.
1309602168509472768 2020-09-26 05:14:22 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @grandmagrit Personally, I have never addressed him with that title. In my eyes he was impeached (STILL!) and unethically exonerated. In my eyes Obama was my last president. tRump can’t have a title to a job he has never done.

1309505249951076354 2020-09-25 22:49:15 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @MysterySolvent Really really sad that it’s not the Obamas standing there. The Obamas loved her and it would have been more appropriate and more respectful. Those two people don’t deserve to be there. It’s more like a slap in the face of the people.
1309503949448384513 2020-09-25 22:44:05 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @benraylujan Who is tired of people saying career politicians haven’t done anything for us? They choose this career because they love their community. @MarkRonchettiNM is running for tRump, for money, for his evangelicals. Mark it’s not for the people.
1309500228215746561 2020-09-25 22:29:18 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @HiraethResists Mine was January. I went straight to costco, stocked up on necessities and watching the people at the stores fighting for toilet paper. I never had to do that nonsense.
1309499705437622273 2020-09-25 22:27:13 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @MarkRonchettiNM Who is tired of people saying career politicians haven’t done anything? We know it takes votes from a group of congressman. I think we can all agree that businessmen have no business in politics. Do we really have to make that mistake again?
1309497949299322880 2020-09-25 22:20:15 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @MarkRonchettiNM Actually he isn’t totally lying to her. She will get the healthcare slotted for the wealthy tRump cult loyalists.
1309497464127356928 2020-09-25 22:18:19 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @MarkRonchettiNM tRump and GOP have NO health plan to replace Obamacare.  their plan is, if you can afford our plan, you are part of the privileged. If you can’t afford it too freeking bad. THERE IS NO PLAN TO REPLACE OBAMACARE! He’s lying to his daughter about that one.
1309493487302307841 2020-09-25 22:02:31 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @TerriGarner126 That was assault simple and plain

1309238857335025665 2020-09-25 05:10:42 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> He is a tRump loyalist using nasty tactics playing dirty only because he’s unqualified and has NO plan to deliver because marks plan is tRumps plan.
1309237969623150596 2020-09-25 05:07:11 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @mocchialini89 He should be ashamed of himself.

1309144534778085378 2020-09-24 22:55:54 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> Now here’s something that makes sense.  Maybe the way they took hitler down is the same way we need to take tRump down. He’s using hitler tactics to gain power, we use anti hitler tactics to take him out! How poetic that would be.

1309141032265748480 2020-09-24 22:41:59 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @blueheartedly He’s on his way. It’s why he’s saying that COVID is “a beautiful thing to see”. That’s a message to his white supremacy cult followers. They all want to clean this country of POC and Mexicans. It’s the exact steps hitler took and he’s been successful so far.

1308923343161221123 2020-09-24 08:16:58 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @Stellablue9 It happened to me too. I lost 600+ people I was following.
1308920073789337601 2020-09-24 08:03:58 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @lynnluvseddie Yup. I got kicked off after that. Lost everyone I was following when I got back on.
1308919619256713218 2020-09-24 08:02:10 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @CupofJoeintheD2 You bet, I lost all the people I was following but my followers are still there, go figure. I’m building up again.
1308909084675051520 2020-09-24 07:20:18 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> Hi everyone. I got kicked off twitter and they purged my follow list, I have to rebuild 😕. It is what it is.
1308509890470711296 2020-09-23 04:54:03 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @robferdman @LatestAnonNews Until someone is charged and convicted.  I feel like the whole of LMPD should be considered an accomplice.
1308509113073176576 2020-09-23 04:50:58 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @ajplus Neighbors knew exactly who he is, its why they called. It was planned.
1308508882357096449 2020-09-23 04:50:03 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> Neighbors knew exactly 💯 who he is!
1308469027132633088 2020-09-23 02:11:40 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @SenSchumer They certainly seem to be getting away with it too. Words mean nothing when tRump’s selling the US out and we’re sitting back and just watching it.
1308468396976230403 2020-09-23 02:09:10 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @MysterySolvent @TimTebow this makes absolutely ZERO sence. tRump was a huge Epstien client, collaborator and business partner. MY GOD WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE FOR YOU TO OPEN YOUR CULT FOLLOWING EYES.

1308444496716333058 2020-09-23 00:34:12 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @IvankaTrump Misdirection. This stepford daughter is playing her dads game. Misdirection. She doesn’t care about America never has, never will. She’s playing her daddy’s games now WOW.

1308434884214632448 2020-09-22 23:56:00 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @kandikay7 He does as ronna tells him too do.
1308434407880101888 2020-09-22 23:54:07 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> He’s been threatened by his own niece. He actually only has one choice. All Republicans can only go one way, RONNAS WAY, even her uncle better do as he’s told.

He can only vote according to how trump tells him to vote. The RNC doesn't allow their candidates to have a mind of their own.

I met him once, waited on him he wasn't much friendly, needed a table away from all people and refused to communicate with staff. 20+ years ago. He wants to jump on the money tRump train thats all.

Which ever vote is counted first, mail in vs in persons is your vote the second one isn't valid. One thing, try not to vote on ivankas chinese patterned voting machines.

1304789237351538688 2020-09-12 22:29:30 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> piece of advise: DO NOT fill out 3rd party absentee/mail ballot forms. Request it from your election office on line or call. These 3rd party forms are designed to bogg down the election office. Staff are required to look at every piece of mail.

Ignore all 3rd party crap! When you submit 3rd pty form, it Boggs down the real ballot forms. That there is tactics to bogg down the election office.

1303879746321776641 2020-09-10 10:15:31 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @MarkRonchettiNM I wonder how you would feel about tRump if if your family died or if your child’s favorite teacher died? I wonder how you would feel if trump sexually abused a family member? How much is too much for you sir? $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

1303875295921999872 2020-09-10 09:57:50 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @bamableu Because BARR approved it. Barr and his father go waaaaaay back with the tRumps and Epstein. Long tight friends.

1303874584828092416 2020-09-10 09:55:00 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @robertjdenault So when tRump said “election fraud” he was actually talking about himself. It doesn’t matter who commits the election fraud as long as he can prove its being done.
1303874145638322177 2020-09-10 09:53:15 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @JoJoFromJerz She clearly hates herself and is as miserable as HELL, you can see it in her face. But for $185,000.00 she’ll lie until the cows come home.
1303873038182735872 2020-09-10 09:48:51 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> Who thinks all the people in Washington that suck tRumps butt either got MONEY, DRUGS, OR TRAFFICKED children? Could that be why they still follow him? They know he’s the worst criminal in US history maybe even worse than Dr. George Hodel even.

1302998878921383936 2020-09-07 23:55:15 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> This is not surprising but the sadness and disgust feeling never diminishes.
1302998216888197125 2020-09-07 23:52:38 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @AustralianOpen He was looking straight at her face when he did that. Clear intent.
1302997946317897728 2020-09-07 23:51:33 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> He was totally looking at her when he did that. He should never be able to play again!
1302996879567880192 2020-09-07 23:47:19 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> Didn’t his dad say he had no business in China? Hmmmmmmmm. The loving son spilling the truth.
1302995849404968960 2020-09-07 23:43:13 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> I’ve been worried about that because he didn’t start destroying our country in 2016. His time in The Peoples House was years of planning in the making. He has after plans as well make no mistake.

And the more you rant and twist reality, the more obvious it becomes. You are a shame and disgrace to our state! and our nation. #tRumpetti
1302977514747420673 2020-09-07 22:30:22 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @RepTorresSmall I’m so glad I don’t have to vote in your race.
1302976700402331649 2020-09-07 22:27:08 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> I’m sure this rodent is a tRumper as well. It’s a real slime ball that has to beat a 16 year old, but then again if tRump can rape and beat a 13 year old girl and get away with it, he can beat a 16 year old and it’s okay.
1302975917472579584 2020-09-07 22:24:01 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @DonaldJTrumpJr I feel so sorry for you, boy. I feel sorry that you were raised to have zero empathy, zero feelings, zero integrity, zero charisma, zero love. You will never know joy with all that hate in your heart.

1301576079778426880 2020-09-04 01:41:34 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @RobertC57435565 @DailyCaller @SpeakerPelosi If you need me to explain it to you. You need more help than you realize. T toss trash out.
1301540960195796992 2020-09-03 23:22:01 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @MichaelRapaport I don’t believe that. He doesn’t do anything worth paying for. He gets his money through his cult church ignorant doners.
1301540013059047424 2020-09-03 23:18:15 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @AZPatriotCo Your not a Christian, your voting for a murdering child rapist. Shame on you.
1301539009286606848 2020-09-03 23:14:15 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @AZPatriotCo What? You make no sence, your following a wolf in sheep’s clothing, you know that and you don’t care. Your complicit and your vote isn’t yours. Your giving it to them. They don’t even like POC. You need a Dr.

1301536854374711297 2020-09-03 23:05:42 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @AnIllicitWriter Ignorant American families are putting their hard earned money and votes in his pockets. tRumpers, he doesn’t care about them one bit! When will they see this?
1301536265398030337 2020-09-03 23:03:21 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> I know lots of tRump 2016 voters that refuse to vote for him now. I don’t know ONE person that has left Biden. It’s why he has to cheat publicly. He’s telling us he knows how much he’s despised.
1301535691357249541 2020-09-03 23:01:04 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @realDonaldTrump Not true sir! And who is Obiden? Your mind is regressing, your getting more childish by the minute.

1301532285146148864 2020-09-03 22:47:32 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> Squatter in chief is telling his base to cheat and at the same time accusing the Dems of cheating. If that doesn’t prove he’s lost his mind, I don’t know what does. Actually the more he cheats the more he didn’t win.
1301531565940510720 2020-09-03 22:44:41 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @JulietForTruth I wonder how many ethics complaints are piled up in this administration? Gotta be pretty long with some of them all competing to see who can rack up the most complaints.
1301530961105104896 2020-09-03 22:42:17 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @Allnkat Evil is all around us folks. Satan has nothing to do with masks. When did Christians and evangelicals become so EVIL that their willing to HATE HATE HATE.

1301513508434124800 2020-09-03 21:32:56 +0800 <Jean_Is_fed_up> @NBCNews He isn’t going to ban anything! He only has to say he’s going to. After the fact he will say, just like his daddy “I didn’t know”.

That’s how tRumps administration does things. It’s expected. Fuckerberg is a tRumper through and through make no mistake about that.

You invited them to your home and picked a fight that your boyfriend jump into. It’s how I saw it.
