1323714246383865856 2020-11-04 03:50:44 +0800 <prelagsmom> Hope voters in NV are voting NO on Question 5 - we don't want to be like California, mandating percentage of power usage from renewables before we are able to produce that amount.  That's why CA is experiencing blackouts.  Don't do same to this state.
1323713785492692992 2020-11-04 03:48:54 +0800 <prelagsmom> Clark Count, NV - when you surrender ballot that was mailed to you, make sure you have voided every page - don't leave it there for anyone to grab and fill in.  Big Black VOID on each page with Sharpie. Then leave it with poll worker. But don't leave a blank ballot with anybody!!
1323713142988263424 2020-11-04 03:46:21 +0800 <prelagsmom> Clark County NV voters - my husband and I had no problems voting this a.m.  If you are told machines are broken, check map in your sample ballot.

Be SURE to use a black Sharpie and cross off every page.  I also wrote "Void" across each page.  Don't let them hand it back to you. You are signing that you "surrendered" it.

And masks. Yeah, wear one if it makes you feel safe, but read the warning on the side of the box. Masks are ineffective and the government has no right to force me to wear a mask -or a burqa

1312431093979574273 2020-10-04 00:35:31 +0800 <prelagsmom> @Robail @BillyBaldwin ‚Äú...that is going to lead to death.‚Äù  Stop with the hype! Survival rate for CoVid is higher than for bacterial pneumonia. We need to stop with the masks, stop all lockdowns and get back to our lives. If you feel vulnerable, see your personal physician and follow his/her advice.
1312429911852773376 2020-10-04 00:30:49 +0800 <prelagsmom> @BillyBaldwin Your point? Initial shutdown aimed to slow spread so  hospitals not overwhelmed. Now ppl seem to think goal is nobody gets sick. That‚Äôs crazy. You get it, you get well, you now have antibodies. Ppl with other health issues should follow their personal physicians‚Äô orders.

And after you‚Äôve had it you have antibodies that help protect your system. Getting CoVid isn‚Äôt a bad thing unless your health is already compromised. Sounds like er may have a herd of Republicans with immunity!!
1312417339862781952 2020-10-03 23:40:52 +0800 <prelagsmom> @RealBrysonGray Trump car parade in Vegas today. Getting ready to roll.

Prez is not in hospital becuz he is so ill, just bcuz he is Pres. They will all have antibodies and all part of journey to herd immunity.  No fun to suffer thru (that cough is icky), but good to get over it.

1311383070411378689 2020-10-01 03:11:02 +0800 <prelagsmom> @DineshDSouza @wajhawk Well, Trump told Biden he wasn‚Äôt smart and graduated in the lower part of his class in college, but then, facts aren‚Äôt the same as name-calling, right!?!

1311367910472839168 2020-10-01 02:10:48 +0800 <prelagsmom> @NCMmnUSA Dig deeper.  There were two diagnostic codes: U07.01 - COVID proven by test.  U07.02-possible COVID by symptoms but no test done.  Both were picked up on death certificates and both were counted in death totals. Both were allowed and pd by ins.  Very deceptive.
1311367167661674496 2020-10-01 02:07:51 +0800 <prelagsmom> @NCMmnUSA @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump FINAL to @NCMmnUSA   This pandemic being used as power grab.  Many ppl are compliant and are truly scared, don't understand what is happening. Maybe they'll never figure it out, but will just wonder what happened. Think about this. Study history. Don't be one of the foolish ones.
1311366094926430209 2020-10-01 02:03:35 +0800 <prelagsmom> @NCMmnUSA @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump 4/4  Stunning how COVID19 has been politicized and publicized. Lockdowns persist. Many ppl who were financially okay will live lives on edge of poverty now. When NV gov finally allows evictions to be filed, estimated over 400K notices will be served (note: only 330M ppl in state)
1311364114082480129 2020-10-01 01:55:43 +0800 <prelagsmom> @NCMmnUSA @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump (3/4)Look at pandemics n history.1957 H2N2 flu hit US. 116,000 deaths. All hospital admits were not tested (so were pts dying WITH H2N2 in count, or just pts dying FROM H2N2?). Those things matter. Critical to understand what numbers are telling us. Figures lie, and liars figure.
1311361362291908608 2020-10-01 01:44:47 +0800 <prelagsmom> @NCMmnUSA @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump 2/3 Nobody knows what numbers were with H1N1; testing never implemented for general public. Approx 12k to 13K deaths - same as COVID. Testing for ALL hospital admits never implemented. So foolish to believe that COVID is way worse, because ##s for H1N1 not aggressively collected.
1311359190917459972 2020-10-01 01:36:09 +0800 <prelagsmom> @NCMmnUSA @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump (1/3)Apologies. It is actually the common cold virus. Only 6% of 200,000 deaths catalogued are FROM covid.  The other 94% are deaths where COVID was present when tested or was suspected (but no actual test) and patient average of 2.6 other comorbidities. see next
1311122069145268224 2020-09-30 09:53:55 +0800 <prelagsmom> @Sanderbug So explain to me how that is happening?

1311101785050767361 2020-09-30 08:33:19 +0800 <prelagsmom> @NCMmnUSA @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump OMG!  You‚Äôre the tool. Check the CDC website and study the numbers. Factor in the false positives problem and the coding issues that have come to light. It‚Äôs the flu, you fool. Get a grip

1307163878648815616 2020-09-19 11:45:29 +0800 <prelagsmom> Las Vegas needs to be opened at 100% - no mandatory masks or any such BS. Business owners going broke.  COVID is not any more a threat than H1N1 or any flu. It is unconscionable that we are living under an open-ended emergency declaration when there is no longer an emergency.
1307163212165427200 2020-09-19 11:42:50 +0800 <prelagsmom> @GovSisolak opens bars in Clark County, NV, as long as case #s don't rise, then pushes testing on ppl (it's free!), and tying opening to # of cases, NOT original goal of spreading hospitalizations so hospitals not overwhelmed. But it sure is fun being in charge, isn't it, Steve?!

Important point you make is that you feel no affiliation with either Dems or Reps, but are independent. This country would be so much better off if each of us voted for public officials based on platform, proven ability and character.

Like the mom who has the horrible spoiled child yet she always has an explanation for his misdeeds - they are never his fault and she downplays the damage he causes.
1301929027595202560 2020-09-05 01:04:03 +0800 <prelagsmom> @AmericaJR How exciting!  More empty rooms!  Right now, thanks to @GovSisolak , we have no open clubs, bars, shows, and severely curtailed restaurant service with gaming featuring plastic cattle chutes. Really think it‚Äôs a matter of just throwing a switch?  LV isn‚Äôt coming back.
1301647603054989312 2020-09-04 06:25:46 +0800 <prelagsmom> @sxdoc @AReawakening Forgive scepticism, but where is date and location of test, and the lab doing the test?  Presumably this is real error, since any lab test such as this should be reported way sooner than six months. If this is real, name of testing facility/lab gives investigators needed info.

1301542356169105412 2020-09-03 23:27:33 +0800 <prelagsmom> @realDonaldTrump Better, still, vote in person.  A mail-on ballot can be lost or rejected along the way. You‚Äôd NEVER mail in a winning lottery ticket!!

He has never claimed to be a logician, nor have I.  That does not preclude the application of logic to the thought process. U sound like interesting fellow who is quite full of himself.

These ppl may not still be ‚Äúregistered voters‚Äù in that state/county. They may have moved to and registered in another state, may be dead, may be abroad.This presents oh-so-many opportunities for fraud!
1301170840273182720 2020-09-02 22:51:17 +0800 <prelagsmom> @BostonSpiderman @RaheemKassam Normally they can tell you that a ballot was issued and returned. They cannot tell you if it was counted. Mail in balloting is open to a wide range of fraud, voter intimidation and ballot tampering. It is a terrible idea.

Mail ballots, which are bulk mailed and have no system to ensure security of vote should be illegal

1301157613850173447 2020-09-02 21:58:44 +0800 <prelagsmom> @BostonSpiderman @RaheemKassam You do understand what ‚Äúall legitimate votes ‚Äú means?  Human beings-with no qualifications other than they volunteered- go thru mailed ballots manually and discard those that they feel have some irregularity in signature/markings. You‚Äôll never know if your ballot was counted.

Mail in ballots cannot be secured and, except for Absentee ballots, shouldn‚Äôt be permitted in federal elections.
1301153769443356673 2020-09-02 21:43:27 +0800 <prelagsmom> @MRSCTS @drayg66 @RaheemKassam @Timcast Yes. Every American citizen has the right to vote. Yes. There is a process set in place for those who cannot make it to the polls. It is called the Absentee ballot. No. There is no ‚Äúright‚Äù to have blank, untraceable ballots bulk-mailed and subsequently unsecured.

Mayors and Governors who fail at this bring misery, destruction and death to their constituents. It is so important for us to vote wisely.
