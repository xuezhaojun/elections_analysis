1342256016285569026 2020-12-25 07:49:06 +0800 <julieblue917> Remove the foreign aid and pet projects and I bet you'll get it passed. We need a CLEAN bill.

Because even though they upped the $$ being given to Americans, they REFUSE to remove the foreign aid, pet projects, and other PORK from the bill. In other words, the $2000 we will be paying back 10 fold in taxes.

How's this....I apologize for using the word "super" to mean "more" or "moreso", or however you said it when you MEANT 2020 elections were more secure than 2016. 🙄  Good enough?...talking to you is like talking to a 16yr old girl

1334980677469499392 2020-12-05 05:59:30 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Oh FFS man. No, you didn't say "super secure". You DID say 2020 was more secure than 2016. Now, I may not have your wording exactly right, but the meaning is the same. You're can't see the forest, for the trees. Comical.
1334979755410526208 2020-12-05 05:55:51 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Why would they need the evidence??? Because they are alleging FRAUD...kinda goes hand in hand like a cause/effect relationship.
1334979273644380160 2020-12-05 05:53:56 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Wow. Ok pull your panties out of your ass. I apologize for not including the word "requested" in my response to you.

1334977343908007937 2020-12-05 05:46:16 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum I thought you said this was a super secure election...even moreso than 2016 is what you said. Why would it be a potential crime scene? Because the potential for fraud is very real, that's why.
1334976670202097664 2020-12-05 05:43:35 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum I notice you have a difficult time answering hard questions. For example, how do you know what the judge did or didn't see in the hearing? It wasn't made public. Sooooo? 🤔
1334976179363672065 2020-12-05 05:41:38 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Semantics. 🙄
1334964617412366336 2020-12-05 04:55:41 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Arizona legislature just called for immediate forensic analysis of their Dominion voting machines. 🤔 Wonder why!
1334964236380823553 2020-12-05 04:54:11 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Um, the hearing was EXACTLY about irregularities with the vote. Not sure where you get your info.
1334963854778896384 2020-12-05 04:52:40 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Which judge in which hearing?
1334962302844456961 2020-12-05 04:46:30 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum How do you know he didn't see enough irregularities??? Did you talk to him??? When was the last time a judge ordered voting machines to be "frozen"??? It's not SOP in elections, to my knowledge.
1334961794993979393 2020-12-05 04:44:28 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Look, I'm not saying ALL of the witnesses are credible. Some, I'm sure, just want their 15 minutes of fame. But IMO there are enough with credible info, that it needs to be thoroughly investigated nationwide. No one should be opposed to that.
1334961200879169536 2020-12-05 04:42:07 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum I'm sure the judge wasn't happy if that is indeed what happened.
1334960975582089216 2020-12-05 04:41:13 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Well.... different states. But I'm sure you knew that. Driver is in PA/NY. Judge gave "freeze order" in GA.   So, there is that to consider. SMDH.
1334960356133752832 2020-12-05 04:38:45 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Right. The fact is the judge saw enough irregularities in what was presented for him to make the order to freeze.   But, yeah you're right, it's probably nothing. Maybe the judge is lying too! 🙄
1334959865966460928 2020-12-05 04:36:49 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum You realize affidavits and oaths given OUTSIDE a courtroom are still valid, right? The oath (or affirmation) stands no matter the setting. Just like when you fill out your taxes. Your signature is your oath that everything is truthful.
1334959453171458050 2020-12-05 04:35:10 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Yes, but usually not all evidence is heard at a hearing. That's why the injunction is needed to be able to finish the investigation.
1334959119216721920 2020-12-05 04:33:51 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Nah.  https://t.co/sqdyseovAJ
1334958825904824321 2020-12-05 04:32:41 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Sorry...you're still off by 1 million.
1334947778644959234 2020-12-05 03:48:47 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum They haven't had full blown court appearance yet. Just hearings for injunctive relief. This isn't rocket science but it seems pretty tough for you nonetheless. 🤦
1334947405532315648 2020-12-05 03:47:18 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Yeah FFS. You are willfully ignorant because your guy "won"!!! That's a fucking shameful stance to take. You said no evidence has been submitted in court. Well here ya go, baldy. 👇 https://t.co/Oq2Tbf0Osa
1334945813315739648 2020-12-05 03:40:58 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Ok so you don't understand mathematical probability. Got it.
1334944866724265984 2020-12-05 03:37:12 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Because there is a distinction between voter fraud and election fraud. They are going after election fraud.   But, I'm sure you already knew that. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
1334944602764136448 2020-12-05 03:36:10 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Actually, you weren't even right about that. 😂😂😂 You said 2.5 million absentee ballots from NYC alone, right?   1.5 Million from the ENTIRE STATE is the correct amount.
1334943986515996672 2020-12-05 03:33:43 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum USPS procedures for contract drivers are the same only more stringent. I KNOW this because my father-in-law is an owner operator OTR driver. So please don't tell me what I know and what I don't know...you don't know me.
1334920385351958530 2020-12-05 01:59:56 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Standard procedure for truck drivers is paperwork detailing what they're hauling, and that paperwork being signed off on at the destination. That is SOP for all truck drivers...and I would think even more stringent procedures would be in play for transporting ballots. 🤷
1334919900360396803 2020-12-05 01:58:00 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Well, flip a coin 300,000 times and see if it comes up heads 90% of the time. That'll give you a pretty good idea of the mathematical possibility of a spike in votes in wee hours of the night...with 90% going to Biden.
1334919267980963840 2020-12-05 01:55:29 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Neither does yours!!! I'm not smug. But it would be exceedingly weird/dangerous for these folks &amp; attorneys to lie about it all. You're probably completely willing to accept an "anonymous source" from MSM but not the folks putting their names &amp; faces to their affidavits. Why?
1334918358009958400 2020-12-05 01:51:52 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum @LATiffani1 Never felt like I had a reason to question. And yes, you did reference the security of this election, comparing it to 2016. 👇So I ask again, what safeguards were put in place?  https://t.co/EF6iqP22Sw
1334899571260964866 2020-12-05 00:37:13 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum Also, still waiting to hear your explanation as to why the USPS driver was denied paperwork.
1334899313244131330 2020-12-05 00:36:12 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum @LATiffani1 On state or county property, there is usually a work order for any type of repair or work to be done. I know this because of the field I work in. But, there isn't one in this case. Which is super odd. But probably nothing right?
1334898667761778688 2020-12-05 00:33:38 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum @LATiffani1 I can tell you my personal story of what happened with my ballot. But, you'll just say it's one  instance and not proof of widespread problem. I've voted in 8 presidential elections and have never questioned the integrity of the vote.
1334897860890959872 2020-12-05 00:30:25 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum @LATiffani1 Ok, no voter ID and no signatures verified by a member of each party. There proved it. Now, YOU said it was completely secure. Back up your claim. Tell me what safeguards were put in place for mass mail-in voting. I'll wait. 🤔
1334884184217669632 2020-12-04 23:36:05 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum @LATiffani1 This was not like ANY other election. The rules were changed in some states even just a few weeks before the election. Only similarity between  2016 election and this one...Trump was on the ballot.  But I would love to hear what safeguards your sure were there.
1334882252627398657 2020-12-04 23:28:24 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum @LATiffani1 Really? Walk me thru that honest process. ID required? No. Signatures verified? No. One person from each party verifying ballots are proper? No. Even the supposed water main break that halted counting was fake. Never happened. But then a huge spike of Biden votes. Makes sense. 🤦
1334881402442018819 2020-12-04 23:25:01 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum My point is, there are enough irregularities that there needs to be an investigation. The fact that you are so willing to accept the results is mind-boggling. I bet,...no, I KNOW... you'd feel differently if Trump won. Be honest, you would wouldn't you.
1334880757521633281 2020-12-04 23:22:28 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum @LATiffani1 I honestly hope you are correct. I guess you just have more faith in people than I do. I mean mass mail in voting with no ID or signature verification...I really hope everyone that voted or had anything to do with this election is as honest as you think they are. 🤷
1334880080175067138 2020-12-04 23:19:46 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum @LATiffani1 Yeah, there have been A LOT of unsubstantiated claims and needless investigation the past 4 years. So, I get what you're saying.
1334878127089041409 2020-12-04 23:12:00 +0800 <julieblue917> @BravoCrazy @CLossing Wow snarky.   Merry Christmas!
1334678893781897217 2020-12-04 10:00:20 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum @LATiffani1 If you're so sure there's no fraud, why would you be against an investigation? Because your guy won. That's why. For me, it's not worth the win if we have to cheat. ALL Americans should be concerned. Exactly what safeguards do you think we're put in place for mass mail in voting?
1334677084162048000 2020-12-04 09:53:08 +0800 <julieblue917> @ChuckCallesto No. I don't.
1334676832835100672 2020-12-04 09:52:08 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum @LATiffani1 The number of ballots this guy said he saw would be way more than what you're suggesting. And military ballots are different. They weren't in the Gaylords the driver saw. Plus, why was he not given paperwork? That is standard practice. He even asked for paperwork and was told no.
1334647081827385344 2020-12-04 07:53:55 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum @LATiffani1 It is not standard operating procedure to ship completed ballots from one state to another...absentee or not. 🙄
1334592463776858113 2020-12-04 04:16:53 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum @LATiffani1 I'm not saying there aren't some wackadoos...but a lot of them aren't. The IT specialist contracted by Dominion certainly didn't seem wacky, except for maybe her hair. Lol
1334591904902627329 2020-12-04 04:14:40 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum @LATiffani1 He gave that explanation in his statement. You should check it out.
1334577625235300352 2020-12-04 03:17:55 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum @LATiffani1 Or how about the USPS contract driver that was made to drive 1000s of completed ballots from NY to PA??? Yeah forget that testimony too...what's the big deal, right??? 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
1334576794444292096 2020-12-04 03:14:37 +0800 <julieblue917> @StevenTrustrum @LATiffani1 Yeah forget those hundreds of affidavits &amp; the IT expert testimony regarding ballot packets. You're right, nothing to see here. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 Seriously, are you blind or just deluded? To say there is not evidence is wholly dishonest. Period.

Martial Law and calling for another election is far more peaceful than the alternative. 🤷 I dunno. I'm working it out.

But, to be sure of that, we need a new election with strict voter ID, no machines involved, one set of rules for the entire country in Nat'l elections, and one person from each party verifying ballots.

Investigations never do anything if those responsible are just allowed to retire and given taxpayer funded pensions. For example, Comey, Mcabe, Clapper, Brennan etc all liars, all have done illegal shit. 🤔

1333917027749093376 2020-12-02 07:32:57 +0800 <julieblue917> @NastruckHarold They're asking because they saw what the FBI did to Flynn, and because MANY Democrats in Congress have said Trump &amp; all associates should be jailed (but won't say for what, of course) and all his supporters put on a list. How very Schutzstaffel of them. How very  1937 of them. 🙄
1333915621491318786 2020-12-02 07:27:21 +0800 <julieblue917> @NastruckHarold I bet if MSM had told you Trump won, &amp; you saw all the evidence of fraud, you'd be livid. You'd feel like your vote for Biden was stolen. Shameful, that you're willing to disenfranchise people's votes just so your guy can win.  I wouldn't want that. But then again, I'm a Patriot

1329879651137642498 2020-11-21 04:09:51 +0800 <julieblue917> Has @KamalaHarris resigned her Senate seat yet? If not, why not? Seems to me if they are so sure Biden won, she would've vacated that position already. 🤔

You have proven yourself, over the course of this convo, to be a dimwit. I'm sorry if that hurts your feelings. Maybe you should just try using factual info for your arguments instead of feelings. 🤷 Just a thought.

You can't be serious...or maybe you just don't know how court proceedings work. Either way, you're ridiculously wrong.

These things take time, and usually lawyers for defense OR prosecution don't lay out all the evidence in a public forum, they do it in the court room. How about you wait till then, huh genius?

Your side prefers to be spoonfed instead of researching...hence your love for MSM. But see, I'm not going to feed you, I'm gonna make you fend for yourself. Next you'll say, "see, you have no evidence". My answer will be, your denial doesn't make it untrue. 🙄

1329860712093532160 2020-11-21 02:54:36 +0800 <julieblue917> @Cole307489271 Basically, they recounted all the same ballots...whether they were fraudulent or not. Waste of time &amp; money unless there is an AUDIT...which, like I said, is very difficult to do without the signatures (which are on the outer envelope, which gets thrown away). 🤔
1329860282617774080 2020-11-21 02:52:53 +0800 <julieblue917> @Cole307489271 It's not really an audit of you can't verify signatures, is it??? They did a RECOUNT, that's it.
1329860008998146049 2020-11-21 02:51:48 +0800 <julieblue917> @Cole307489271 Well, we don't have "mob rule" in this country so the popular vote means diddly-squat. 🤷
1329858272350724096 2020-11-21 02:44:54 +0800 <julieblue917> @Cole307489271 Depends on what SCOTUS thinks, but I would like to see a new election with some safeguards in place to guarantee integrity and transparency. I don't think that's too much to ask since our vote is our voice. 🤷
1329857358860869635 2020-11-21 02:41:16 +0800 <julieblue917> @Cole307489271 IMO, there's enough affidavits, enough irregularities in the math, enough non-transparency in ballot counting... Yes, new election. One would think w/ unprecedented mass mail-in voting, that folks would've wanted to "cross every T &amp; dot every I" to make sure this election perfect
1329856407181484032 2020-11-21 02:37:29 +0800 <julieblue917> @Cole307489271 So the guy that couldn't get 50 people to a rally, with a running mate who couldn't poll over 2% in the primaries, who has no platform of his own except opposite of whatever Trump did...brought in more votes than Barrack Obama? That doesn't even make sense.
1329855491338510337 2020-11-21 02:33:51 +0800 <julieblue917> @Cole307489271 The fact that we want an audit of this election, even though it may take Congressional seats away, should tell you that integrity in our elections is more important to us than who wins.
1329854508692762624 2020-11-21 02:29:57 +0800 <julieblue917> @Cole307489271 So, you're saying a little election fraud is ok? 🤔 Do you know in Canada, they don't use any type of electronic voting systems? ALL hand counted. Know why?? To avoid election fraud. Canadian mail in ballots have strict application process, &amp; ONE SET of rules for Nat'l elections.
1329852163430858753 2020-11-21 02:20:37 +0800 <julieblue917> @Cole307489271 Rudy said he's not going after VOTER fraud...he's going after ELECTION fraud. There's a difference.
1329851956588756992 2020-11-21 02:19:48 +0800 <julieblue917> @Cole307489271 Kinda hard to match signatures since the envelopes with the signatures on them are thrown away. Ballots are not signed.

1329849671095906306 2020-11-21 02:10:43 +0800 <julieblue917> @Cole307489271 Signature need to match, addresses need to match, postmarked by 11/3. We have rules for our elections, and they should be followed.
1329849369357545472 2020-11-21 02:09:31 +0800 <julieblue917> @Cole307489271 Legal votes should be counted. Illegal or illegitimate votes should be thrown out. Period.
1329846185494908928 2020-11-21 01:56:52 +0800 <julieblue917> @jaketapper Just because you deny there's evidence, doesn't mean there is none, Jake. I highly doubt these folks would put their reputations on the line and allow others to perjure themselves by fabricating evidence in their affidavits. That's 800 people, Jake. But you know better???
1329845334630010881 2020-11-21 01:53:29 +0800 <julieblue917> @Cole307489271 The proof about Hillary is also easily get verifiable. I don't do other people's homework for them. It's your job as an American to check this shit out for yourself. You can start w/ Coney's press conf in 2016.
1329844960112197633 2020-11-21 01:52:00 +0800 <julieblue917> @Cole307489271 And YOUR DENIAL doesn't make it false. I don't have the evidence. I'm not on Trump's legal team. However, some of the affidavits are a matter of public record &amp; easily verifiable. I guess you believe 800 people would risk perjury charges by falsifying affidavits? 🙄 Sure, honey.

Trump's EO signed in 2018 regarding foreign interference in our elections is going to play a big part here. Our votes were tallied in other countries, (yes, stupid practice, I know)

Within 4 HOURS, the clinic called to tell them they all tested positive. They were never tested. 🤔

Also, my mom-in-law, in a nursing home,  tested positive 4 times...no symptoms. I see you talk about scientific method. So how are those false-positives being recorded?

Use straight edged ones. They cut the meat instead of tear, and it makes a difference in the texture. Try it.👍❤️

1326315111640752133 2020-11-11 08:05:39 +0800 <julieblue917> @Secul8r @emlas I watched the witnesses on a press conference. I haven't watched ANY of Trump's press conferences. Again, this isn't about who we voted for, it's about making sure that your vote as well as mine isn't squandered thru fraud. I'd think you'd be in favor of that. 🤔 But whatever.
1326307300273922049 2020-11-11 07:34:36 +0800 <julieblue917> @emlas @Secul8r How can you say our elections have integrity when NO ONE from the GOP was allowed to verify or count ANY ballot? Only Democrats were allowed. Seems to me, if you want to avoid the appearance of something fraudulent, you let the other side take part. 🤷
1326302733834444800 2020-11-11 07:16:27 +0800 <julieblue917> @Secul8r @emlas Obviously, you don't understand how elections work. Poor thing.

1326298613551489024 2020-11-11 07:00:05 +0800 <julieblue917> @emlas I saw 1/2 a dozen witnesses in a press conference the other day. So, which one are you referring to?
1326297790314508288 2020-11-11 06:56:49 +0800 <julieblue917> @emlas Can't find any source for what you allege about the USPS whistleblower. Care to cite an actual SOURCE instead of someone else's tweet?
1326297361287585792 2020-11-11 06:55:07 +0800 <julieblue917> @emlas Hmmmm, weird your retweet here seems to be the ONLY source of that information. I have researched for any info of the whistleblower's retraction. Do you have an actual SOURCE? Or, are you just relying on this tweet?
1326293320113381376 2020-11-11 06:39:03 +0800 <julieblue917> @emlas Oh he's not the only witness, dear. You poor poor girl. Smdh. 🙄
1326292867552223232 2020-11-11 06:37:15 +0800 <julieblue917> Yeah, let's just go with your feelings. Evidence doesn't matter at all. 🙄 Oh jeez, you're too pretty to be this stupid. 🤦
1326292654817095685 2020-11-11 06:36:24 +0800 <julieblue917> @emlas You watch too much MSM. Witneses ARE evidence, honey. That's why attorney's call them to testify during trials and other court proceedings. 🙄
1326291786642280448 2020-11-11 06:32:57 +0800 <julieblue917> I believe in INVESTIGATING. I don't believe in overturning unless the investigation shows massive voter fraud. You SHOULD feel the same way. But, you don't. How odd. 🤔

Why are you lying to people, telling them there is no evidence of voter fraud, when YOU KNOW there is? Are you scared for people to know what you did? You should be.

C'mon man, say it with me...."witnesses ARE evidence".  This isn't rocket science but 70+ million people in the US don't "get" it. 🙄
1326272340607463424 2020-11-11 05:15:41 +0800 <julieblue917> @RandPaul One way of determining fraud would be to have poll watchers from BOTH parties participate in the verification and counting of mail in ballots. But, that didn't happen...and here we are. 🤷

1326230903987662848 2020-11-11 02:31:02 +0800 <julieblue917> @wherry2020 @PaulaJo41820905 Hirono is a putz.
1326227183719755776 2020-11-11 02:16:15 +0800 <julieblue917> @RyanLizza Three men and a lady. 😂😂😂😂
1326225790208368640 2020-11-11 02:10:43 +0800 <julieblue917> @blackgirlinmain #CountEveryVote instead of #CountEveryLegalVote makes it sound like the mafia is running our elections. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄   Why would you put a racist slant on the integrity of our elections? That is a ridiculous take on this situation.
1326222285359910912 2020-11-11 01:56:47 +0800 <julieblue917> @ShannonFreshour @Jim_Jordan Even the illegal ones!!!!
1326220388020281345 2020-11-11 01:49:15 +0800 <julieblue917> @ScienceOfficerB @ksorbs So, those people got to verify ballots/counting then? Or no? Cuz, if the answer is no, how can you say this election was done with integrity/transparency. Shouldn't have needed a court order unless there is something to hide. 🤔
1326213873058287616 2020-11-11 01:23:21 +0800 <julieblue917> @ScienceOfficerB @ksorbs Please tell me how ballots can be verified from 15' away???
1326211718314225664 2020-11-11 01:14:48 +0800 <julieblue917> @BeschlossDC You don't get to tell POTUS, or anyone else, what to say. And btw, we can see that the press IS the enemy of the people for ourselves. It's not like you hide your dishonesty.
1326209469059985408 2020-11-11 01:05:51 +0800 <julieblue917> @ScienceOfficerB @ksorbs We believe in election integrity &amp; transparency, which this election severely lacks. Usually, the reason people don't want others to see what they're doing is that they're doing something wrong. 🤷 Seriously, why not let GOP reps verify ballots, or help w/ counts in any way?
1326207266773626880 2020-11-11 00:57:06 +0800 <julieblue917> @DbWrasslin @ksorbs Right, Spartacus was Corey Booker!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1326206899209953280 2020-11-11 00:55:39 +0800 <julieblue917> Congratulations Pres. Sorbo!!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🤪😘
1326206651972554752 2020-11-11 00:54:40 +0800 <julieblue917> @JessDuntno @RepAdamSchiff Exactly!!
1326202662514089984 2020-11-11 00:38:49 +0800 <julieblue917> @RepAdamSchiff Why would you want to make people pay thousands in premiums during a pandemic?
1326185813021917184 2020-11-10 23:31:51 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner Don't need a history of your candidates. I already know their history. A couple of people who have done NOTHING but incarcerate Black people for non-violent crime, ruining lives. Great choices!!!! 🤮
1326185417931063301 2020-11-10 23:30:17 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner Yeah I remember. I never thought any of that. You would do well to not lump all conservatives together with cuckoos. Just that simple act might save you on the future.
1326185102313881600 2020-11-10 23:29:02 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner No one has to TELL me shit. Look at his policies!!!! I mean I know Liberals will choose to be spoonfed bullshit by MSM, but you can actually listen to Biden himself and see.
1326184326166269952 2020-11-10 23:25:57 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner Now you're just being stupid, unless you can cite a source to back up your claim that USPS lost a ton of ballots. 🙄
1326054879094190080 2020-11-10 14:51:34 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner My source for what Biden will or will not do is Joe Biden himself. I've heard straight from his mouth all that I needed to hear...except the mumbled jumbled parts. 🤷 See ya later.
1326053621855784960 2020-11-10 14:46:34 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner I'm not threatening anyone, but my meaning isn't veiled. America will not be a Socialist country. It's a prediction.
1326052134576480256 2020-11-10 14:40:40 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner If there's no tyranny, you have nothing to worry about...at least not on a massive scale.
1326051405740699648 2020-11-10 14:37:46 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner Don't count your chickens before they're hatched!
1326051147103100928 2020-11-10 14:36:44 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner And the lead disappeared like in just ONE STATE. If it was 700,000 votes NATIONALLY then yes, that math would add up.
1326050619241627652 2020-11-10 14:34:39 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner Cop-outs. Early voting went on for weeks. California magically called the state for Biden at 8pm (polls closed at 8pm) 🤔
1326049747921108992 2020-11-10 14:31:11 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner Ever think that as POTUS, Trump knows more about these people and their character than you do?
1326049561341685761 2020-11-10 14:30:26 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner First of all FBI has nothing to do with troops overseas. Trump is in charge of the military and is thankfully bringing a lot of them home with all the peace treaties he's been getting done in the ME.
1326048501864656898 2020-11-10 14:26:14 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner  https://t.co/Vg8INJzkDG
1326047835226214401 2020-11-10 14:23:35 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner He didn't manipulate shit. That crap about USPS you spouted shows you watch CNN or MSNBC.  https://t.co/3J7HBsKusW
1326047040325910529 2020-11-10 14:20:25 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner Hmmmmmm, that's not what Justice Alito said. 🤔
1326046892124372994 2020-11-10 14:19:50 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner Unlike you, I RARELY watch any MSM. I don't need them telling me how to think.
1326046688646082561 2020-11-10 14:19:01 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner If you feel so strongly this election was on the up and up, you shouldn't mind an investigation into these irregularities so it doesn't happen again, right??
1326046423519961089 2020-11-10 14:17:58 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner Ballots not signed so no verifiable signature, addresses not matching, software glitches in all the states with other issues. Not to mention, Feinstein's husband runs the software co. &amp; Pelosi is a major investor. (Fishy)
1326045887290699776 2020-11-10 14:15:50 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner Wray should've been gone a long time ago. And I don't care what Trump is doing. I care about facts like GOP poll watchers not allowed to verify ballots, &amp; in some cases ignoring a court order that they be allowed to do so, 700,000 vote lead disappears?? Unheard of say experts.
1326044539396583431 2020-11-10 14:10:29 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner Trump didn't manipulate the way people voted. Dems did. See, you don't even have your facts straight. Another MSM sheep.
1326044193668571136 2020-11-10 14:09:07 +0800 <julieblue917> @tadrwagner @aghenis Baseless???? 🤦 If the shoe was on the other foot, you wouldn't be saying that. These claims are not baseless.
1326043595682455552 2020-11-10 14:06:44 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner You get what you give. Libs have given us HATE for 4yrs, pardon me if I don't get worked up about Libs getting a taste of their own medicine. And about us being armed? Well, have you ever heard "don't poke a sleeping bear"? Libs probably should've thought about that awhile back.
1326041114193715201 2020-11-10 13:56:52 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner I don't need Trump to show me who "enemies" are. It's pretty apparent.
1326040516627066886 2020-11-10 13:54:30 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner And I supposed neither of you sees ANYTHING wrong with this election, right???
1326040200280113152 2020-11-10 13:53:15 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner Alex, you have a very biased view. You conveniently leave out anything liberals have done. Trump supporters don't perpetrate more violence than Liberals...you just HEAR about it more. If you can't figure out that MSM is not your friend, then there's no help for you.
1326039242976288768 2020-11-10 13:49:26 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner Well, maybe Dems shouldn't have wished harm on us; called us racist; made excuses for rioting, looting, assaults as "protests", even going so far as to bail out perpetrators. Even some have in MSM have called for putting us up against a wall. Wtf did you expect? Breaking point.
1326038193536294912 2020-11-10 13:45:16 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner Good!!! It's about time Conservatives get pissed off. But, at least we aren't rioting like Liberals tend to do... 🤷 Hilarious you're triggered by someone "flipping the bird", and that's you're example of conservatives being hateful. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1326036944749424641 2020-11-10 13:40:18 +0800 <julieblue917> @RepSwalwell You're exactly right!...Because Democrats don't give a shit about the law. As long as you get what you want, it doesn't matter HOW you get it. Any moron can look at the facts and see evidence of fraud in this election. 🙄
1326035611908632576 2020-11-10 13:35:01 +0800 <julieblue917> @aghenis @tadrwagner 😂😂😂😂😂😂 one lady in a sea of people flipping off the camera. Smdh.
1326035216675209217 2020-11-10 13:33:26 +0800 <julieblue917> @tadrwagner After what I've seen the last 4 yrs??? You bet your ass I do.
1326034714231148545 2020-11-10 13:31:27 +0800 <julieblue917> @brhodes It's pretty sad you don't understand how this works. Haven't you been at this politics thing for awhile now? 🙄
1326000096782151681 2020-11-10 11:13:53 +0800 <julieblue917> @007mss Nope, wouldn't want to cheat our Constitution to win. That's not American.
1325953379332317185 2020-11-10 08:08:15 +0800 <julieblue917> @Jim_Jordan Because they already know the truth...they cheated.
1325919195884736512 2020-11-10 05:52:25 +0800 <julieblue917> LOGAN ACT!!!! Biden has not been certified POTUS, this is not a "transition team". This is wishful thinking that they're ACTING ON!!! Biden is guilty of violating the law. #LoganAct #Bidenisnotmypresident  #BidenIsNotPresidentElect
1325918414108495872 2020-11-10 05:49:18 +0800 <julieblue917> @OD_ant Sadly, yes I do.🤬🤬🤬
1325911136227610624 2020-11-10 05:20:23 +0800 <julieblue917> @jaketapper Trump didn't fire him in a tweet. 🙄 Jeez, Jake you're so f*cking dishonest. 😠
1325910642109239296 2020-11-10 05:18:25 +0800 <julieblue917> Hmmmmm, that's not really how it happened, Joe. #Voterfraud
1325909610474041344 2020-11-10 05:14:20 +0800 <julieblue917> @sassycupcake20 Wait....there's NUMBING SPRAY!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
1325892362950725632 2020-11-10 04:05:47 +0800 <julieblue917> No dude, it isn't legal. Biden hasn't been certified POTUS yet. Therefore, he cannot be talking with foreign leaders on behalf of the US.
1325891731577958400 2020-11-10 04:03:17 +0800 <julieblue917> Oh please oh please oh please ,  https://t.co/bCbVzPPIa3
1325879345223622656 2020-11-10 03:14:04 +0800 <julieblue917> @catturd2 Hell no. After what they've done for the past 4 yrs???? I don't have time for trash people in my life.
1325872016335908864 2020-11-10 02:44:56 +0800 <julieblue917> @Lrihendry They used common core math.
1325871749053915137 2020-11-10 02:43:53 +0800 <julieblue917> @Feisty_FL It's definitely tyranny.
1325869051915067394 2020-11-10 02:33:10 +0800 <julieblue917> @Feisty_FL We begged for Dems to work with us for the betterment of the entire country for 4 yrs. They screamed, cried, investigated &amp; impeached, called us names and wished death on us. I'm not unifying with people like that.
1325866987549908992 2020-11-10 02:24:57 +0800 <julieblue917> @McKaylaRoseJ @DC_Draino That's ok....we'll finish it, and settle the problem at the same time.
1325866562549477376 2020-11-10 02:23:16 +0800 <julieblue917> No she's not. Lie lie lie lie lie! Every f*cking day!!!!
1325857523140714496 2020-11-10 01:47:21 +0800 <julieblue917> @ACTforAmerica Voted in person
1325856919194492929 2020-11-10 01:44:57 +0800 <julieblue917> @CNN That's because the media doesn't get to decide who wins. Y'all are getting just a bit too big for your britches. You're just television...not even "news", just TV.
1325856373419044865 2020-11-10 01:42:47 +0800 <julieblue917> Why weren't you saying this in 2016 when Liberals were throwing fits over losing? Oh wait,...apologies...I forgot who I was talking to for a sec. #Hypocrite
1325855535061626880 2020-11-10 01:39:27 +0800 <julieblue917> @Stvzbnk @rey_atl @solo_sonata @m_mmmbt @tjrheil_np They can't even "fraud" correctly.
1325840940213301248 2020-11-10 00:41:27 +0800 <julieblue917> Oh believe me, dear. We've been seeing the hypocrisy of the Left for years now. This is enraging, but not surprising.
1325839875623378944 2020-11-10 00:37:13 +0800 <julieblue917> @MichelleObama The "status quo" is what we defeated in 2016, and what we're RETURNING to if Biden wins the WH. It'll be back to the corruption &amp; pocket-lining Democrats are known for. Good job feckless Liberals for giving Biden a chance to continue ruining our country. Idiots.
1325838005479776256 2020-11-10 00:29:48 +0800 <julieblue917> @EricMMatheny Mmmmmm, 🤔 'bout 50.
1325836445379039240 2020-11-10 00:23:36 +0800 <julieblue917> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden There are very few people I hate on this Earth... you're one of 'em.
1325835966234333195 2020-11-10 00:21:41 +0800 <julieblue917> @EricMMatheny I'm ASSUMING Liberals know what the Golden Rule is, and that they have been treating us the way they wish to be treated for the past 4 yrs.  I, for one, am happy to oblige.
1325835099477139456 2020-11-10 00:18:15 +0800 <julieblue917> @NahBabyNah That's not for him to decide.
1325834957160288256 2020-11-10 00:17:41 +0800 <julieblue917> That Pfizer vaccine...TRUMP'S accomplishment.
1325832477848424448 2020-11-10 00:07:50 +0800 <julieblue917> There isn't ONE thing that makes sense about this election. Democrats celebrating prematurely couldn't care less about our Republic. They just wanted to beat us, because the party of "tolerance &amp; inclusivity" are the most hateful people on Earth, &amp; some are very fine people.
1325648162774687745 2020-11-09 11:55:26 +0800 <julieblue917> @BobFoolery @Stvzbnk @Feisty_FL @charliekirk11 @RealJamesWoods 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 yeah, that's not going to happen.
1325491856155705350 2020-11-09 01:34:19 +0800 <julieblue917> One way to improve the integrity of our elections would be for @foxnews @cnn @msnbc @CBSNews @ABC @NBCNews  etc TO STOP PRONOUNCING WINNERS. #Election2020  #ElectionResults2020
1325254258959155200 2020-11-08 09:50:12 +0800 <julieblue917> @BeschlossDC This is pretty simple, really. Tell the truth without your narrative, and let your audience decide. But you refuse to do that interjecting your feelings, as if we care or are incapable of thinking for ourselves. Get a grip. Until then, the press IS the enemy of the people. Period
1325252397938061313 2020-11-08 09:42:48 +0800 <julieblue917> @DonaldJTrumpJr Because when we revolt, it's war...as history shows.

1325210520442425347 2020-11-08 06:56:23 +0800 <julieblue917> @Twitter is furthering the false narrative that voter fraud is "rare", while censoring posts about evidence of voter fraud. But didn't @jack just testify before Congress under oath that Twatter doesn't do this????   Jack is a #liar

You're an idiot shyster. Why ANYONE would believe a word you say is beyond me. If you have a wife/girlfriend, she should leave you.

1324929434789404673 2020-11-07 12:19:27 +0800 <julieblue917> @m_mmmbt @realDonaldTrump We need ONE set of rules for National elections. Let the States run their elections how they want. But for POTUS, we need ONE set of rules every State follows. Period.

I've taught my son the same way. We gun-toting Patriots are literally the only thing standing in the way of invasion or the Communist manifesto of the Democrats. Teach wisely.

She wants to KNOW who voted for Trump, so in her Communist utopia she can rid the country of the "scourge". This woman is dangerous, a blight on our country. She needs to be put out, and squared away.

I have NEVER, in my lifetime, heard of a CONSERVATIVE asking for a list of people who supported/voted for a Liberal candidate. @AOC just did that. 🤬🤬🤬🤬

1324796806501486593 2020-11-07 03:32:26 +0800 <julieblue917> @JRubinBlogger You know what I learned from reading the replies here...we have more idiot Liberals than I first believed. I thought there were still some with common sense. I was wrong. Apologies.

1324794189561778177 2020-11-07 03:22:02 +0800 <julieblue917> @davejshea @IngrahamAngle Does this type of stuff ever happen in cities with Republican  leadership? Just curious. Cuz, it seems like it's always Dem cities that have this problem.
1324790588974063616 2020-11-07 03:07:44 +0800 <julieblue917> @davejshea @IngrahamAngle Don't know 🤷 But IMO, given that this election is completely different, you'd think that election officials would be doing all they can to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.

B) ALL 50 STATES ARE FOLLOWING SAME GUIDELINES.   and they're not.   Signatures are NOT being verified, that is part of the problem so how do you ID someone who voted by mail?
1324728442332442624 2020-11-06 23:00:47 +0800 <julieblue917> @VforVenick @boxerunlocked Nope, now you're just lying. Those may be the laws, but they are not being adhered to.
1324728256784855042 2020-11-06 23:00:03 +0800 <julieblue917> @VforVenick @boxerunlocked And do you know for sure that they are enforcing voter ID in those states?   35 states, huh? Well, I guess that only leaves 15 states where election Fraud could take place.  15 states, Steve.
1324727442762706944 2020-11-06 22:56:49 +0800 <julieblue917> @VforVenick @boxerunlocked There needs to be ONE SET of rules for national elections that ALL states follow.  Careful Steve, pull your head out of your ass or we're done here. That block button looking really tempting right now. You're a smart guy, what we're seeing in our elections in complete bs.

1324513013357965313 2020-11-06 08:44:45 +0800 <julieblue917> @johnrobertsFox What's the harm of investigating the integrity of an election? Isn't it important enough? For me, the fact that GOP reps are not allowed to observe the count and are being removed in Detroit. There is video evidence of this. You should be asking what are the Dems hiding?

Why aren't signatures verfied? Why isn't voter ID required? THIS is what election "integrity" should include. There's a lot of evidence of fraud. Do you really want to win so bad, you'd cheat to do it?

1324371019608420354 2020-11-05 23:20:31 +0800 <julieblue917> There's no such thing as "election integrity" in the US. There are no safeguards in place to keep the vote &amp; count honest. People that tell you "voter ID is racist" are only looking for ways to cheat. We need ONE set of rules for all States to follow in Federal Elections. Period.

1324109127358902272 2020-11-05 05:59:51 +0800 <julieblue917> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Great! I agree with that. Now, tell me how, in at least a couple of states, there are more ballots than registered voters. 🙄
1324107565576318978 2020-11-05 05:53:39 +0800 <julieblue917> @FiveThirtyEight Statistically VERY IMPROBABLE without fraud.

1324066346431205376 2020-11-05 03:09:51 +0800 <julieblue917> @ACTforAmerica @realDonaldTrump Yep...More than anyone else in our government.
1324065364796305409 2020-11-05 03:05:57 +0800 <julieblue917> @Cernovich Yes.
1324062252866043904 2020-11-05 02:53:35 +0800 <julieblue917> @familyunequal @realDonaldTrump What about the states that have more ballots than registered voters??? Election Fraud is not imaginary. It's real, and it's happening right now.
1324053820561747968 2020-11-05 02:20:05 +0800 <julieblue917> Considering what Democrats have done to try and remove a duly elected president for the last 4yrs, is anyone surprised about the fraud going on in this election? #Elections2020

1323845366484103168 2020-11-04 12:31:45 +0800 <julieblue917> If Republicans win the House and keep the Senate...and somehow Trump loses the WH,  I hope Republicans obstruct, investigate, &amp; impeach Biden ....just like Democrats did to Trump. Only this time, that impeachment would stick &amp; Biden would be ousted. Compromised by China.
1323842203068719104 2020-11-04 12:19:11 +0800 <julieblue917> @bakoff333 I like @newsmax a lot. I'm only watching Fox to see Juan Williams cry.

1323839409544855552 2020-11-04 12:08:05 +0800 <julieblue917> @Stvzbnk @TheJessieWoo I think most Americans are FINALLY seeing how the Democrat party tries to divide us. If it's not apparent now, it will be tomorrow morning. People are seeing Trump stands for ALL Americans, regardless of race, religion, creed etc. If you're American, you're "in the family".

There you have it. Nicely done, sir. Live up to the vote
1323833195977043968 2020-11-04 11:43:24 +0800 <julieblue917> Trump is gonna win. Democrats will scream &amp; cry. Full stop. #Trump2020
1323832780623499265 2020-11-04 11:41:45 +0800 <julieblue917> @cenkuygur @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump There is no way to look at the polls a thousand ways. There's only two ways...and most of those polls are skewed Democrat, with only 1000 people polled in a country of 300+ million. Your polls are shit.

1323808382306824192 2020-11-04 10:04:48 +0800 <julieblue917> Why can't we come up with a way for registered voters to vote online securely? We have the tech to have every registered voters in the US get ONE vote in Federal Elections, don't we? IMO, it would be way more dependable than relying on USPS to deliver ballots. 🤔  #TrumpPence2020
1323805810082787332 2020-11-04 09:54:34 +0800 <julieblue917> Honest question...do you REALLY believe China &amp; Russia WOULDN'T want a Biden presidency??? Look at world politics. Look at what Trump has done with tariffs and sanctions for those two countries. 🙄 China and Russia prefer Biden. As the record shows, Biden is easier on them.
1323804651305644032 2020-11-04 09:49:58 +0800 <julieblue917> @TheJessieWoo You're a sheep. Sad.

1321156316488818693 2020-10-28 02:26:26 +0800 <julieblue917> @davejshea @Jim_Jordan I mean, the "lock her/him up" chant started after Comey did a press conference listing HRC's crimes, and then said "no prosecution". I don't think anything like that has happened with regard to Jordan, has it?

The science and data has been massively distorted by such disregard for the scientific method, in favor of sensationalism and the NEED to make Trump look bad.

Calls people traitors, lies about potus &amp; his supporters, perpetuates MSM garbage, ignores actual FACT...then cries "victim" when you get your comeuppance

Seriously, ya'll need to think for yourself. Trump has denounced, and denounced and denounced. But MSM won't play those videos...they want you misled &amp; lied to.
1316035180348370945 2020-10-13 23:16:52 +0800 <julieblue917> Well, I would say you've lost your ability to critically think for yourself then. Your Democrat masters brainwashed you. Your movement has become a farce, doing more harm than good. The indiscriminate violence  in the name of BLM, does nothing to further the cause.

As a SCOTUS, I am absolutely positive that RGB knew deathbed wishes, no matter how fervent, are not covered in the Constitution. However, the duties of POTUS are CLEARLY outlined, and include the filling of vacant seats on the SCOTUS. 🙄🙄🙄

1314023253258756096 2020-10-08 10:02:11 +0800 <julieblue917> Alright, I've had enough. She brought up the completely debunked "suckers/losers" comment in regard to our military. She is a total twat.

Is this REALLY who should represent our country??? Harris says whatever she needs to say in the moment, to get votes
1314018526861156352 2020-10-08 09:43:24 +0800 <julieblue917> Yes!!!!! VP Pence don't let up!!! Call her out on her MANY MANY LIES!!! She just said Biden will not ban fracking. He already said he would.

Her family owned slaves, she incarcerated more POC's for non- violent crimes than any other CA AG. She's a shyster. Make no mistake, our country will not survive if #BidenHarris is elected.
1314013074437922818 2020-10-08 09:21:44 +0800 <julieblue917> Just turned on VP debate. Kamala is already LYING. I'm sorry (not really) she is a complete f*ck stick.

1314002592620515328 2020-10-08 08:40:05 +0800 <julieblue917> @SharylAttkisson Seems like since he's been assigned to investigate...he should have everything he needs to do so. If he's being blocked from access to documents, that can ONLY MEAN ONE THING...Dems are trying to hide something. #Russiagate #HillaryClinton #ObamaKnew

1313999623078522880 2020-10-08 08:28:17 +0800 <julieblue917> @JeepDog5 If she does, Pence should bring up that her Grandpa owned slaves. But, he won't...because he has more couth than I do. 😂😂😂😂 If it were me, the first thing I would say is that she's descended from slave owners. Shut that race card shit down right off the bat. #Trump2020
1313998162554761216 2020-10-08 08:22:29 +0800 <julieblue917> @RichardGrenell Yep. If you break up w/ Taylor Swift, you can bet she's gonna write a stupid song about it. 🙄

The sad thing is, your "followers" will believe this asinine shit, but somehow, you've managed to make them believe, against ALL FACTS, that Trump was working w/ Russia in 2016, &amp; HRC is a saint.

He's 74 yrs old, and probably overweight for his height. You REALLY can't see this???? My God, Tad. I care about you ...wake the f*ck up!!!
1313650029773676544 2020-10-07 09:19:08 +0800 <julieblue917> @tadrwagner And no his numbers are not "down the toilet"...unless you are an MSM sheep. I live in CA, bro. I have NEVER seen the support for Trump that I have seen in the last few months. People in CA are waking up to Democrat scams, I suggest you do the same.
1313649501756940289 2020-10-07 09:17:02 +0800 <julieblue917> @tadrwagner They were negotiating for illegals getting stimulus pay. During a pandemic, USA citizens should be  FIRST to be considered in US policy. With Dems, we never are. I'm pretty surprised U don't see that. Trump is for AMERICANS first, as any sane voting American should want him to be

1313545146474979328 2020-10-07 02:22:22 +0800 <julieblue917> You realize it's DEMOCRATS that are keeping the latest round of stimulus from getting passed, right? They care more about their pet pork projects being included in the bill than they do about getting Americans the relief they depserately need. Dems are the enemy of the people.
1313544338241069056 2020-10-07 02:19:09 +0800 <julieblue917> @Upincomin @RBReich @AOC Actually, you DO get to choose your doctor, thanks to Pres. Trump.

Funny, when it's an outgoing republican POTUS, the new Democrat pres gets the credit...when the Democrat pres is the one who's leaving, and Republican POTUS takes over ...the Dem gets all the credit. Happens every time.
1313300194130186242 2020-10-06 10:09:00 +0800 <julieblue917> @WheresMyArk_23 As for the policies, research for yourself! It's very easily verifiable. If you can't find the energy to do the homework, think about this, why is there more BLACK support for Trump now than in 2016??? Critical thinking &amp; facts are important. If you want to learn, research.
1313298938632470529 2020-10-06 10:04:01 +0800 <julieblue917> @WheresMyArk_23 "Underfunded" means nothing to parents trying to get their kids the best education possible. That is a state government issue.

1313296941661532162 2020-10-06 09:56:05 +0800 <julieblue917> Sooooo basically exactly what Trump did ...let the States decide for themselves. 🙄
1313296635468935168 2020-10-06 09:54:52 +0800 <julieblue917> @WheresMyArk_23 Yeah really? What? Lowest minority unemployment EVER, investment in "opportunity zones", school choice etc etc etc....all that not GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU? No other POTUS has done what Trump's done for minorities, EVER!!! You're just a parrot, a sheep for liberal talking points.

1312039262276124673 2020-10-02 22:38:31 +0800 <julieblue917> Celebrating the fact that POTUS &amp; FLOTUS tested positive for Covid makes you a trash person. #TrumpHasCovid #Trump2020
1312036215198085120 2020-10-02 22:26:24 +0800 <julieblue917> @VinnieMac84 Btw, your ignorance and hypocrisy are showing....if you even know what those words mean. 🤔🙄
1312034165760483328 2020-10-02 22:18:16 +0800 <julieblue917> @VinnieMac84 Joe Biden is a racist, a liar, a sexual predator, who even lies about the way his first wife died. Neither Trump nor Biden are perfect men. But as far as the job goes, Trump has done way more in less than 4 yrs. Biden, well Biden hasn't done shit in his career in politics.

For you to continue this charade is beneath your office, and makes you a #liar Trump isn't racist, never has been.

1311782452176642048 2020-10-02 05:38:02 +0800 <julieblue917> @johnrobertsFox just lost all credibility with me. Initially by asking the stupid "racism" question that Trump has answered dozens of times...and then for his sophomoric temper tantrum on-air when he didn't get the answer he wanted. 🙄 What an idiot.
1311776492536303616 2020-10-02 05:14:22 +0800 <julieblue917> @tadrwagner @thebradfordfile Look, I care about what he's done since being POTUS. IF there is illegal shit in his past, I'm sure the "many investigations" will bring that out and it will be dealt with accordingly...just like anyone else who commits crimes SHOULD be. (Unless of course we're talking HRC.🙄)

1311760893500293120 2020-10-02 04:12:23 +0800 <julieblue917> Joe Biden did the eulogy for a man who was the Grand Poobah of the KKK. But Trump is the racist??? Yeah, ok.🙄 #Trump2020
1311740855699595269 2020-10-02 02:52:45 +0800 <julieblue917> So, I'm sorry Black friends/neighbors...according to Joe Biden, 1 in 500 of you will be dead by December. 🤦😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  Joe Biden is so stupid.  #Trump2020
1311737784298856448 2020-10-02 02:40:33 +0800 <julieblue917> Wow, so you want people kicked out of their homes?

B) IRS would gleefully be all over Trump.   I think it's pretty awful for NYT to release private info. But, ANYTHING to make Trump look bad is ok these days, regardless of nefarious motivations. 🙄

1311711513804120074 2020-10-02 00:56:09 +0800 <julieblue917> @JoeBiden If Trump didn't pay taxes, don't you think the IRS would take great delight in going after him??? 🤔
1311701691939479552 2020-10-02 00:17:08 +0800 <julieblue917> @joshrogin Soooooo that would mean Hunter still has unfulfilled obligations to the Navy...time left to serve, didn't complete his contract. That's what "administratively separated" means.

Pretty sure if DJT did anything illegal on his taxes, the IRS would take great pleasure in finding it...but they haven't. Case closed.
1311698811446722562 2020-10-02 00:05:41 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or I agree with all you said here. 👍

1311679543980093440 2020-10-01 22:49:07 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or Been thinking about what you said here. Yes, I believe BLM started out as a great movement, w/ great purpose. Over the past few years, we've seen them pick/choose which Black Lives they're upset over losing &amp; speak against racism while acting like racists. I'm not into hypocrisy.
1311677943265988609 2020-10-01 22:42:46 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or What do you mean, "would I like it"? Liberals have been calling Trump supporters racists for 4 years!!!  I have been called a white supremacist over, &amp; over...too many times to count now....all because of which box I checked on a ballot, and I'm mixed race. 🤔🙄
1311500196321189889 2020-10-01 10:56:27 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or I agree.

1311484562665545729 2020-10-01 09:54:20 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or Not saying ALL protestors are taking part in the violence, so please don't take it that way.
1311484231135236097 2020-10-01 09:53:01 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or I do stand up for people, and what happened to George Floyd was a crime. Don't know why you ASSUME I would feel otherwise. But, they moved right on past protesting against Floyd's murder to rioting, looting, assaulting innocent people, shooting cops....all in the name of BLM.
1311475883350335488 2020-10-01 09:19:51 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or There is lots of $$ going into BLM. Therefore, there has to be someone to manage that $$, and decide how to spend it. That is more than a "movement".
1311453456553652225 2020-10-01 07:50:44 +0800 <julieblue917> @tevan2864 I'm all for it!

1311439014029860865 2020-10-01 06:53:20 +0800 <julieblue917> Hey #BLM if you don't want to be labeled a "terrorist organization", how about denouncing the looting, arson, and violence perpetrated in your name??? Just a thought. 🤔
1311436982384496650 2020-10-01 06:45:16 +0800 <julieblue917> @AP Does that include Biden not wearing a wire?
1311436406959595522 2020-10-01 06:42:59 +0800 <julieblue917> @greta The market has confidence in Trump...same as before Covid.

1311420146762817537 2020-10-01 05:38:22 +0800 <julieblue917> @charliekirk11 Why didn't he submit to a "no wearing a wire" rule...and why am I now seeing pictures of Biden wearing a wire???? I do not want to see a debate between Trump and Biden's advisors. If Biden REALLY wore a wire, did he REALLY debate Pres. Trump?
1311419152347926529 2020-10-01 05:34:25 +0800 <julieblue917> When our own @FBI interferes in our elections MORE than other countries...that's a real concern. Whether the Russians want Trump to be POTUS or not is irrelevant. #ComeyHearing #Trump2020

1311413701677920259 2020-10-01 05:12:46 +0800 <julieblue917> @MarshaBlackburn He LITERALLY listed her crimes, and then said "no charges".   I'll say it again, JIM COMEY LITERALLY LISTED HER CRIMES AND THEN SAID "NO CHARGES".
1311411688831414274 2020-10-01 05:04:46 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or @Davey3482 So the 6% would be 12,000+ less deaths. That is significant to me.
1311410492393631749 2020-10-01 05:00:00 +0800 <julieblue917> For those of you HELLBENT on saying Trump is working with Russia, here are some FACTS for your consideration. 🤔 #RussianCollusion  https://t.co/Kl4Pow7G15
1311393900393832449 2020-10-01 03:54:05 +0800 <julieblue917> @seanmdav That's like an Executive Chef saying it's not his job to make sure the food is good. 🤦

1311392125586673665 2020-10-01 03:47:01 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or I am not attempting to minimize anything. I majored in microbiology in college. I know that the way they have recorded these deaths would've never flown with my lab professors. Different contributing factors must be categorized and totaled accordingly.
1311391628486160386 2020-10-01 03:45:03 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or Let me put this to you simply. Since you brought up Cancer...a person with Pancreatic Cancer that they've been battling for months or years gets Covid and dies,...that death is listed among the number of fatalities overall, which is NOT GOOD SCIENCE.
1311390383981592577 2020-10-01 03:40:06 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or Great name for a horse.
1311390275533787138 2020-10-01 03:39:40 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or According to the data I sent you, out of 7+ million confirmed cases, 2.9% resulted in fatality, most of those had contributing co-morbitity. That does not make us among the worst, it just doesn't...regardless of who's in the WH. I'm just looking at the data.
1311387605603319810 2020-10-01 03:29:04 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or Also, lumping deaths of people w/ co-morbitity together w/ those who died from Covid alone, is not good science. US mortality rate from Covid alone is much lower than 200,000+, as is stated in CDC's report. I guess someone over there decided to apply scientific method properly.
1311386159675834369 2020-10-01 03:23:19 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or I just showed you the numbers. I didn't show you a graph. There is nothing to read "upside down".
1311384683872243712 2020-10-01 03:17:27 +0800 <julieblue917> @AriFleischer @joerogan would be a better moderator ...more fair. Chris Wallace is not unbiased.
1311384045863960576 2020-10-01 03:14:55 +0800 <julieblue917> Why does Feinstein keep bringing up MANAFORT? Because she's too cowardly to admit the FBI f*cked up this investigation by lying. That's why. #ComeyHearing

1311369634046783489 2020-10-01 02:17:39 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or The POINT IS...MSM is misleading. We ARE doing more testing per capita than other countries, which is why we have a high number of cases, &amp; we DON'T have the highest death rate. This data suggests US is doing a good job. But Trump will get no kudos or credit. It's weird.
1311344413369565187 2020-10-01 00:37:26 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or These are not in order. But attention should be paid to the percentages in this chart. Again, if you heard from MSM that US is leading the world in Covid deaths, as you have stated....well, then you've been duped. Sorry.  https://t.co/aVfKvUiqrn
1311342750432927745 2020-10-01 00:30:49 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or I believe it's the 10th amendment. The screenshot from Johns Hopkins below also CLEARLY shows US mortality rate for Covid is 2.9% Twitter doesn't allow me anough characters to list all the countries with a death rate higher than ours. But you can check it out for yourself &amp; see.  https://t.co/4UJgDe7EEy
1311124908265496576 2020-09-30 10:05:12 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or It's not an excuse. It's a reason, there's a difference. And not "every other country is doing better" than us. That isn't factual. Question, do you think the STATES are responsible for public health as stated in the Constitution, or no?
1311120882480414721 2020-09-30 09:49:12 +0800 <julieblue917> I honestly don't give a shit about seeing Trump's tax returns...or Biden's, for that matter. #Trump2020

1311119608552722432 2020-09-30 09:44:08 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or I was referring to the fact that Biden keeps saying he LIED to us, that he knew in FEBRUARY.  Trump didn't LIE. As for the "plan"...there is no "plan", because the data is ever changing with a new virus. Trump has responded accordingly as new things have been learned.
1311117440345092096 2020-09-30 09:35:31 +0800 <julieblue917> @GeorgePapa19 Trump...because he's best for our country. Simple.
1311117061725265920 2020-09-30 09:34:01 +0800 <julieblue917> Biden keeps saying Pres. Trump  LIED to the American people about Covid, that Trump knew it was bad and didn't tell us. How can that be true when Trump put a ban on travel from China and virus epicenters in Europe in late January??? We all knew about that. 🤔 #Trump2020

This is what needs to happen, make insurance plans inexpensive for employers/employees, tax breaks for employers who provide insurance, &amp; for unemployed, good skill specific jobs w/ employers who provide insurance. Not rocket science.

There isn't a world where this is in ANY WAY ok. Your championing of him makes you just a bad. Only trash people abuse animals and make excuses for it.

It'll damage the hoof wall.  If the damage is too severe, the horse has to be put down. Maybe learn a thing or two b4 posting idiotic shit. This man abused that horse. Full stop

Upgrading military equipment, bringing troops home ...on top of vets getting to choose their doctor, which is HUGE! Those are just off the top of my head. I'd have to research for more to refresh my memory.
1308169749348495360 2020-09-22 06:22:27 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or What I know for sure, is you can't believe everything you read/hear, there are two sides to every story, and Trump's ACTIONS toward taking care of our military speaks volumes. He's done more for them than any POTUS in decades.
1308169283768209408 2020-09-22 06:20:36 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or Obviously I would have a problem with that.

1308168695756152832 2020-09-22 06:18:16 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or Yeah, I don't love EO's either. But, for as "authoritarian" as everyone wants to say Trump is...he's signed FAR LESS executive orders than Obama, or Bush, or Clinton.
1308167923937292290 2020-09-22 06:15:12 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or If the intelligence is good, of course we should investigate. We don't investigate every piece of intel we get cuz it's not always reliable.
1308167626577727488 2020-09-22 06:14:01 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or Those "sources" are "anonymous". At least they were as of last week. If they are confirmed statements. You should be able to give me one name of a person who said it.

1308156348928897024 2020-09-22 05:29:12 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or As for the "placing hit on our soldiers" thing. Our intel community is not even sure that was a real thing. So, why would we go attacking countries over unproven intel?
1308155991133884416 2020-09-22 05:27:47 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or This has been debunked. Trump never called them suckers/losers, at least not according to the folks that were actually there. As for the VA, my husband is a disabled Navy vet. He gets WAY BETTER care since Trump took office than he ever had under Obama, plus gets to pick doctor.
1308152297990414336 2020-09-22 05:13:06 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or Hmmmmm, weird. I got a tax cut, and I live in CA...and I am not rich.

1308150112141467648 2020-09-22 05:04:25 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or I dunno, I think best best economy, lowest unemployment, lower taxes, Trade Deals that are actually beneficial to USA, end to endless wars, VA choice of doctor, right to try, lower Rx $$, just to name a few...speaks for itself. You can't call these failures.

1308141095830712320 2020-09-22 04:28:35 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or Cool! Certainly seems like life has been great for you the last 4 years. 😁
1308137806770745349 2020-09-22 04:15:31 +0800 <julieblue917> @JobCre8or Well, here's the thing...except for saying that Trump has been impeached, everything else you said in your tweet is false...and straight out of MSM narrative.
1308126304416399361 2020-09-22 03:29:49 +0800 <julieblue917> @Spectre_Bazza @Stvzbnk @jaketapper Seems to me Democrats are also hypocrites since their opinions have  also changed since 2016. They were in favor of Obama getting to nominate a SCOTUS, bit not Trump. The fact you don't see THEIR hypocrisy, but readily point out Republicans', is a bit mind boggling. 🙄
1308125643180138496 2020-09-22 03:27:11 +0800 <julieblue917> @Spectre_Bazza @Stvzbnk @jaketapper I didn't agree w/ waiting to nominate a SCOTUS then, and I don't agree with waiting now. It makes no diff to me what GOP Senators say. Let's just follow what the CONSTITUTION says.

He would NEVER have tried to politicize his own death by asking that his seat remain vacant till after an election. He knew the Constitution well, and that "dying wishes" aren't mentioned in it.
1308111975549865985 2020-09-22 02:32:53 +0800 <julieblue917> @OldNavyUSA What are they going to impeach him for this time???....following the Constitution??

1308097060214697984 2020-09-22 01:33:37 +0800 <julieblue917> @Spectre_Bazza @jaketapper As soon as you figure out how to compose an articulate sentence so that people may discern your meaning, I'd be happy to answer your question.
1308092185368170497 2020-09-22 01:14:14 +0800 <julieblue917> @Brendajurgens3 @jaketapper 1)Trump in NO WAY sullied RGB. In fact, just the opposite.  2)It doesn't matter how hard she fought for women's rights, a dying wish does not negate the Constitution. 🙄 3)Democrats have incessantly lied/stretched the truth for 4 years. Why should we believe them now?
1308090194503974912 2020-09-22 01:06:20 +0800 <julieblue917> @jaketapper Well, maybe if Democrats hadn't spent the entirety of the last 4 years lying or, at the very least, twisting the truth,...maybe they would be a bit easier to believe. 🤔

Democrats' thinking is so upside down, if Trump DIDN'T appoint a new SCOTUS, they'd probably scream "dereliction of duty". They tried to impeach him in an election year...he can appoint a new SCOTUS in an election year.

Why is Biden saying "Trump wants to defund Police?" Biden may have "character", but he doesn't have any cognition or critical thinking ability. Not really good for a guy running for POTUS.

1303511193823313920 2020-09-09 09:51:01 +0800 <julieblue917> They are saying it is the fastest moving wildfire in California history,...and since this state damn near burns to the ground every year...this one is something to be REALLY concerned about.   Thoughts from the ash cloud.

How can you possibly think that will make anything better for Americans?? Lying, demented, old fool.

1303032651096363008 2020-09-08 02:09:27 +0800 <julieblue917> @MayorOfLA Why not just get our power companies to upgrade our power grids from their current "3rd world" status??? I mean, 5th largest economy, and we have to have scheduled outages for power conservation???? You gotta be kiddin' me. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HOTTEST PART OF OUR YEAR!!!! 🤦
1303018919293149184 2020-09-08 01:14:53 +0800 <julieblue917> @Stvzbnk Yes. I have some. Plus Ken has a military issue respirator with canisters if things get really bad.

1303015583760359424 2020-09-08 01:01:38 +0800 <julieblue917> @Stvzbnk I can't see the stop sign a the corner close to our house. It's about 200 yards away. That's how bad the smoke is.
1303015020691816449 2020-09-08 00:59:24 +0800 <julieblue917> @Stvzbnk Yes, I'm have a well. I don't have it set up for manual operation. But we have access to a large generator that power everything in the house just fine. 😜 And I have a propane tank that takes care of hot water needs.
1303014417798324224 2020-09-08 00:57:00 +0800 <julieblue917> @RandPaul Rand, I agree with you. But the replies from your constituents here,...whew! I didn't know you represented such morons!!!!
1303012596358852608 2020-09-08 00:49:46 +0800 <julieblue917> @Stvzbnk Luckily yes, I am. Weird that our power grid is that of a 3rd world country...when we're supposed to be the 5th largest economy in the world. 🤔
1303011217435312128 2020-09-08 00:44:17 +0800 <julieblue917> @Stvzbnk As for temperatures, yesterday, unbelievably...it wasn't as hot as LA county. We only hit 112. It's the smoke and ash that gathers in this valley that's killing us. We a literally surrounded by fire right now.
1303010631960813570 2020-09-08 00:41:58 +0800 <julieblue917> @Stvzbnk Not great!  New fire started last night at Huntington Lake about an hour away. Almost 80,000 acres burned, 0% contained. Smoke and bonfire smell this morning. Worse than it has been in a month.
1302740783917707266 2020-09-07 06:49:41 +0800 <julieblue917> @mylovliving Well, maybe some forest management would help to mitigate the fire season a bit...so we don't have this "kiln-like" trapped heat effect. Just a thought. 🤔
1302734002873196544 2020-09-07 06:22:44 +0800 <julieblue917> @marilyn94911799 That's bullshit. US as a "business" was BOOMING before Covid. That's a fact.

Now, go have yourself a wonderful Labor day with family. That's exactly what I'm about to do. Try to find some love today. It sounds like you need it. God bless you.

1302728495831760896 2020-09-07 06:00:51 +0800 <julieblue917> @marilyn94911799 I never said he doesn't know what he's doing. I said he may not have known protocols. There's a difference.

I'm not a John McCain fan, regardless that he was a POW...so we're my cousins, they died there!!! Their names are on the Vietnam memorial! Did they die because he gave up troop locations? I don't know. What I KNOW is Trump loves our military.
1302722039883599872 2020-09-07 05:35:12 +0800 <julieblue917> @marilyn94911799 For you to not answer my "deflections" versus your "outrage" speaks volumes.
1302714003458723840 2020-09-07 05:03:16 +0800 <julieblue917> @marilyn94911799 Trump &amp; McCain hated each other. Trump did the right thing in the end. Tell me, did Obama do the right thing in Benghazi? How about McCain &amp; Kerry helping arm the "rebels" in Syria, who many soon after became ISIS. Do you blame them too for their mistakes? If not, it's hypocrisy.
1302712302114750465 2020-09-07 04:56:30 +0800 <julieblue917> @marilyn94911799 Don't get snarky. We're having an adult conversation. If you want it to go another way,...I'm out. There is a chance, that since Trump is obviously NOT a politician, he was unsure of the protocols, &amp; had to be instructed. But no one told him to send AF1. That was Trump's idea.
1302711459785318403 2020-09-07 04:53:09 +0800 <julieblue917> @marilyn94911799 And no, once Trump signed the bill, my husband chose a different doctor...and was in within 2 weeks. There was no wait from the VA.
1302711129915883520 2020-09-07 04:51:51 +0800 <julieblue917> @marilyn94911799 What I know personally, is that my husband, who is a disabled vet was NOT getting the care he needed under Obama. Now, he is...since Trump "expanded it". Now, my husband is doing waaayyyyy better, that is the fact I care about.
1302673667113934848 2020-09-07 02:22:59 +0800 <julieblue917> @marilyn94911799 If Trump hates the military so much, why is he the first POTUS EVER to vets free choice of doctor...and still the govt foots the bill?
1302673371872636933 2020-09-07 02:21:49 +0800 <julieblue917> @marilyn94911799 If Trump really thought McCain wasn't a hero, why did he send Air Force one to pick up his casket to bring to DC? He didn't have to do that. Actions speak louder than words.
1302644944746684421 2020-09-07 00:28:51 +0800 <julieblue917> @oliviakrauth Why do "journalists" only tell half the truth,...is that the honesty you seem to be talking about?

No, #BidenHatesOurMilitary

Name the officials. Otherwise this story is bullshit. Trump has done sooooo much for our military and veterans. I know, I was born into a military family, married to a military man.

He is very obviously in mental decline, &amp; should be having happy times w/ family... Not facing a lion like Trump. This election is going to destroy that poor man.

There is NOTHING in Trump's actions that suggest he feels anything but LOVE for our military. This story is #FakeNews
1302041989920169984 2020-09-05 08:32:55 +0800 <julieblue917> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump Nope...not even a little.

I have yet to see a Biden sign in Fresno county, which is a REALLY big county. I think if there are Biden supporters in CA, they must be in San Fran or LA areas. But even then,....folks in SF and LA are getting fed up with Democrat leadership. At least, I hope so

1302030528405667841 2020-09-05 07:47:23 +0800 <julieblue917> @charliekirk11 The fact that @GavinNewsom has lied to us OVER AND OVER AGAIN, coupled with his Authoritarian ways (kept his winery open and shut down the rest of the state)...is going to hand CA to Trump in Nov. I live in Fresno county, NO ONE LIKES NEWSOM HERE, and most of us love Trump.

1301567752629440512 2020-09-04 01:08:28 +0800 <julieblue917> @KamalaHarris Why did it take your campaign 100 days to denounce the violence? Your reluctance to do so is what "fanned the flames". Trump denounced the murder of George Floyd and violence that ensued, early on. But, since you don't LISTEN, you don't know. Just projecting your own shortcomings

Doesn't the Governor hold the purse strings? Take your whiny, feckless ass to his office, &amp; ask him, or do you think your prob will be solved by tweet bashing POTUS?🙄
1301545869569789952 2020-09-03 23:41:31 +0800 <julieblue917> @tedwheeler Nah, Trump still wants to help the PEOPLE...he just doesn't want to help YOU. Just like Newsom...bash the POTUS all day long until you need $$. Then you come with your hand out and are surprised when the president you've denigrated over &amp; over again says no?
1301544169542840321 2020-09-03 23:34:46 +0800 <julieblue917> @arnoldpimley I thought you said you're a "data" guy. But, it sounds like you're letting your emotions get in the way. Trump set things in motion early-on to try &amp; protect us, &amp; was excoriated for it, called racist, xenophobic etc. Meanwhile, Dem govs put Covid patients in nursing homes. Data.
1301538696936566793 2020-09-03 23:13:01 +0800 <julieblue917> @arnoldpimley Since when is the POTUS supposed to take over the health policies of individual states? That's why states elect Governors.
1301538615479005191 2020-09-03 23:12:42 +0800 <julieblue917> @arnoldpimley You understand EVERYONE was down-playing the virus, right?? WHO initially said no animal-human transmission. Biden called Trump racist for travel bans. Nancy Pelosi went to China Town and said "don't worry, go out, have fun". Fauci said "carry on as normal". No one had a clue.
1301374451066400769 2020-09-03 12:20:22 +0800 <julieblue917> @Davey3482 No, I am not oblivious to facts. Yes there are idiots in my party. But, isn't that true for both Dems and Reps?  Yes, I'd probably hate Trump if I met him in person. But, I try to see facts without emotion, and sometimes that means accepting a hard truth.

1301373117990801410 2020-09-03 12:15:04 +0800 <julieblue917> @Davey3482 @shaylakraze @RyanB1234321 @TimMurtaugh @Cat_Luvs_Trump Covid deaths, according to scientific processes of recording data, are inflated. Yes, that's what I'm saying. If you have worked in a lab, you know that ALL determinate factors are recorded &amp; categorized. Not lumped together &amp; given as a mass number. That's NOT science.
1301372130144088064 2020-09-03 12:11:08 +0800 <julieblue917> @Davey3482 @shaylakraze @RyanB1234321 @TimMurtaugh @Cat_Luvs_Trump My dad died from Luekemia brought on by radiation treatments for Prostate cancer,...his death cert says he died from Prostate cancer. Sooooooo?
1301371380944916480 2020-09-03 12:08:10 +0800 <julieblue917> @Davey3482 @RyanB1234321 @TimMurtaugh @Cat_Luvs_Trump Btw, who said I have no outrage about Cancer? My dream as a major in microbiology was to work at in a high level CDC lab working on a cure for Cancer, and to irradicate truly dangerous diseases like Ebola. Please don't tell me what I'm enraged about.
1301370639584866304 2020-09-03 12:05:13 +0800 <julieblue917> @brithume Pelosi is up for re-election in Nov. Extremely bad optics since she could've  had a stylist COME TO HER HOME! Bottom line, she skirted the rules she touts, and got busted. Typical Liberal hypocrite.
1301370169378263042 2020-09-03 12:03:21 +0800 <julieblue917> @Davey3482 @shaylakraze @RyanB1234321 @TimMurtaugh @Cat_Luvs_Trump Your argument doesn't make sense. When did we start talking about Cancer? I have no idea how to respond here. But  FYI, cancer would DEFINITELY have an effect on your ability to fight off Covid. Cancer hampers the immune response, especially for those undergoing treatment.
1301369272107560960 2020-09-03 11:59:47 +0800 <julieblue917> @shaylakraze @RyanB1234321 @Davey3482 @TimMurtaugh @Cat_Luvs_Trump Not every other country has a population the size of the US, something to consider. Plus, not "every" country has this "under control".
1301368908364931075 2020-09-03 11:58:20 +0800 <julieblue917> @Davey3482 @shaylakraze @RyanB1234321 @TimMurtaugh @Cat_Luvs_Trump And like I said, Covid is extremely virulent, meaning easy to contract. So is the common cold...very easy to contract. The difference on Covid is the body's immune response developing more fluid on the lungs which brings a myriad of complications, kind of like severe Pneumonia.
1301367756999196674 2020-09-03 11:53:46 +0800 <julieblue917> @Davey3482 @shaylakraze @RyanB1234321 @TimMurtaugh @Cat_Luvs_Trump What kills you is the body's immune response to the virus, not the virus itself. Fluid build-up in lungs requiring ventilation, etc. If you have underlying conditions, this complicates things.
1301366251134959616 2020-09-03 11:47:47 +0800 <julieblue917> @shaylakraze @RyanB1234321 @Davey3482 @TimMurtaugh @Cat_Luvs_Trump I can get w/ your sentiment. But seriously, viruses, by their nature, are unpredictable because they mutate. That's what makes them incurable. No POTUS...not Trump, not Obama, not any POTUS could've seen this coming &amp; prepared. Covid is extremely virulent, but not high mortality.
1301363569968046080 2020-09-03 11:37:07 +0800 <julieblue917> @shaylakraze @RyanB1234321 @Davey3482 @TimMurtaugh @Cat_Luvs_Trump True story, family of 4 I personally know, Dad was exposed on the job. Whole family went for testing, 4 hour wait at clinic, signed their names, went home to wait to go back for test,...IN 3 HRS CLINIC CALLED TO TELL THEM THEY WERE ALL POSITIVE!!! Didn't catch that? Read it again
1301362523216601088 2020-09-03 11:32:58 +0800 <julieblue917> @shaylakraze @RyanB1234321 @Davey3482 @TimMurtaugh @Cat_Luvs_Trump No lie. My 84 yr old ex-MIL is in a home and has tested "positive" 5 times for Covid. Never a symptom, nothing. Know why? Nursing homes get $$ for positive Covid cases.
1301362136610869248 2020-09-03 11:31:26 +0800 <julieblue917> @shaylakraze @RyanB1234321 @Davey3482 @TimMurtaugh @Cat_Luvs_Trump Why were nursing homes excluded? Especially since SEVERAL governors put Covid positive patients in nursing homes in preparation for MASS numbers of Covid patients at hospitals...which never happened?
1301361179197976576 2020-09-03 11:27:37 +0800 <julieblue917> @shaylakraze @Davey3482 @RyanB1234321 @TimMurtaugh @Cat_Luvs_Trump Comorbitity by definition is "underlying conditions". That's why it's called COmorbitity and not just MORBITITY. Get it?
1301360790155350021 2020-09-03 11:26:05 +0800 <julieblue917> @shaylakraze @Davey3482 @RyanB1234321 @TimMurtaugh @Cat_Luvs_Trump Comorbitity is EXACTLY what we're talking about. SCIENTIFICALLY you can't record deaths from Covid WITHOUT recording the underlying conditions in a different category. That's EXACTLY what was happening. Recording deaths from purely Covid related complications is SCIENCE.

I just read the CDC's report, and harkened back to my degree in microbiology to  know how scientific process works. Glad to see those folks at Qanon are not all idiots. 👍😁

Recording deaths from patients with underlying conditions as purely Covid related...is NOT good science, and inflates our numbers. If you're intelligent, and have studied ANY scientific procedures at all...you know this.

Or did the heart condition play a part? Recording their death as purely Covid related is NOT goo science...but that is what has been happening.
1301354696553029633 2020-09-03 11:01:52 +0800 <julieblue917> @shaylakraze @RyanB1234321 @TimMurtaugh @Cat_Luvs_Trump I never said the CDC was unreliable. A new virus is unpredictable, with new date coming out every day. This isn't rocket science to figure this out. 🤔 Biden saying he would've done this/that differently is a lie. He wouldn't have known what to do any better THAN ANY POTUS!!!
1301353852499718149 2020-09-03 10:58:31 +0800 <julieblue917> @shaylakraze You're asking questions, so I am assuming you're an intelligent person...and no matter how much you hate Trump as a person, you can't deny the good he's done, or that he's an effective POTUS. This is what I'm hoping, at least. Do you REALLY want Socialism for our free country?
1301352512335671296 2020-09-03 10:53:11 +0800 <julieblue917> @shaylakraze @RyanB1234321 @TimMurtaugh @Cat_Luvs_Trump 2/2 The economic catastrophe that happened as a result of shutting our country down...based on erroneous data...is EXACTLY what the Dems want. At least Biden has a talking point because of it. This virus is NOT Trump's fault. Dems willfully disregard the data because of hatred.
1301352012659875840 2020-09-03 10:51:12 +0800 <julieblue917> @shaylakraze @RyanB1234321 @TimMurtaugh @Cat_Luvs_Trump It is the term coined for this virus. The CDC released updated reports a couple days ago. The numbers of deaths due to Covid have been largely exaggerated (recording deaths from Covid without underlying conditions = not good science). 1/2
1301344701946105857 2020-09-03 10:22:09 +0800 <julieblue917> I am LITERALLY saying nothing of the sort.

Why fight him on every action he takes? Because they WANT the virus to shut US down.
