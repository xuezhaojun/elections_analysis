1341454039632982019 2020-12-23 02:42:20 +0800 <drea4liberty> The swamp is punishing us for DARING to elect/re-elect un-swamp people like @realDonaldTrump  How DARE we think that “of the people, by the people, for the people” is still in effect.
1340077296791801861 2020-12-19 07:31:39 +0800 <drea4liberty> @DrDathanPaterno Better question. Who’s not a traitor?

1339797373808197634 2020-12-18 12:59:20 +0800 <drea4liberty> @adamhousley You would think that a percentage to upgrade and train...would be included in these bills, but no. This is bureaucratic’s “plausible deniability” when the auditors come knocking.  No private entity would get away with this.
1339709393336733696 2020-12-18 07:09:44 +0800 <drea4liberty> @KelinciHutan @WW_NEWS_ Yep.  It’s interesting gossip at a minimum.  It’s more believable than the dossier, though. They made the rules.

For example, the “Walmart’s” brag of the $2000 donations,which is good, but 50 sm local biz at $100 a pop is $5000. Often they give more than that.

1325120304218300417 2020-11-08 00:57:54 +0800 <drea4liberty> Media tried to call the election for Gore in 2000 before polls closed in FL.  They called for Kerry in 2004 based on “exit polling”before counting......  Media has a bad record. There’s a process in each State that certifies their election.  PA defied SCOTUS twice. Sit down.
