1343557060156416003 2020-12-28 21:58:59 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Just the laugh I needed
1343384894215487488 2020-12-28 10:34:52 +0800 <ProtesterPark> We now officially &amp; forever know that Trump's desire to golf is greater than his desire to act like a President.  https://t.co/6l6ej8Np3H
1342171107919622145 2020-12-25 02:11:43 +0800 <ProtesterPark> He turned a swamp into a sewer.  He needs to be Flushed down with it.
1341359037766615046 2020-12-22 20:24:50 +0800 <ProtesterPark> That must be a really expensive tuna on rye
1341358474089934856 2020-12-22 20:22:36 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Duh
1340407774413516801 2020-12-20 05:24:51 +0800 <ProtesterPark> @BradleyWhitford Gizmo doesn't like to share the lime light  https://t.co/NlTH4srdUX

1339044611495518209 2020-12-16 11:08:08 +0800 <ProtesterPark> I knownthis isna very serious issue.  But did the Russians find out the truth about Area 51 &amp; who really killed Kennedy &amp; where is Elvis living  now?

1325603323525943298 2020-11-09 08:57:15 +0800 <ProtesterPark> It has always been my favorite hymn
1325603094286266368 2020-11-09 08:56:20 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Especially when they have no foundation
1325388955383107584 2020-11-08 18:45:26 +0800 <ProtesterPark> That was my reaction too
1325192653479190528 2020-11-08 05:45:24 +0800 <ProtesterPark> A welcome family embrace at the finish line.  Going to enjoy hearing "At The Biden White House today..."  on the news.

1325152784862228480 2020-11-08 03:06:58 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Nope.  Can't do it yet.  It's gonna cost me a few more Hail Mary's for penance for that.
1325151235230507009 2020-11-08 03:00:49 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Louder Josh!!!! Trump didn't hear you on his golf course.
1325151043051720704 2020-11-08 03:00:03 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Not me.  I'm more energized than I've been in years.  I feel like I could run a marathon.  Bench press my weight.  The clouds have lifted.  The rains have stopped.  The sun is out &amp; Freedom is singing its sweet sweet song.
1325148164630872069 2020-11-08 02:48:37 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Looking forward to having you as a 1st Lady

1325122553560621056 2020-11-08 01:06:51 +0800 <ProtesterPark> I began my Twitter account the day of the Lafayette protests &amp; Trump's Bible march.  Such a beautiful sight to see today as I am watching crowds entering Lafayette Square today with JOYFUL chants.  God Bless America!
1325120112064684032 2020-11-08 00:57:08 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Goodness prevails

1325114053874814976 2020-11-08 00:33:04 +0800 <ProtesterPark> The air has never smelled so sweet.  So nice to take a deep breath again.

1324685735904108546 2020-11-06 20:11:05 +0800 <ProtesterPark> He also disrespected everyone whoever fought &amp; died for our protected freedoms as Americans

1324685288971657219 2020-11-06 20:09:19 +0800 <ProtesterPark> What the hell took so long
1324538126702989315 2020-11-06 10:24:32 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Rhoades wouldn't have voted for Trump either.  He would have set this whole thing up just so Trump would look like the whiny spoiled brat that he is &amp; the personally serve him &amp; Barr with the warrants for his Arrest.
1324523062553923584 2020-11-06 09:24:41 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Ignore him he has Vote Shrinkage

1324513094266212363 2020-11-06 08:45:04 +0800 <ProtesterPark> She obviously knew her opponent.   She spoke the Truth.  Too bad more Americans were deaf to it.
1324512117718999041 2020-11-06 08:41:11 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Amen

1324508972762730496 2020-11-06 08:28:41 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Biden won't get exhausted.  This is just gonna add to the momentum
1324508000309125121 2020-11-06 08:24:50 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Go Georgia Go!!!!!

1324500952917921792 2020-11-06 07:56:49 +0800 <ProtesterPark> But Trump spells it cofrawdfefe
1324500545181261824 2020-11-06 07:55:12 +0800 <ProtesterPark> This is just soooooo Sad!  He really is clueless  https://t.co/gjLGb5zHWF
1324378548279431169 2020-11-05 23:50:26 +0800 <ProtesterPark> I claim that my size 12 feet really are size 8.  So that all those cute shoes I really like will actually fit.
1324181863292903424 2020-11-05 10:48:52 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Your husband was an honorable man.  I can only hope he's looking down on all of America hoping we get this right.

1324180522063507457 2020-11-05 10:43:33 +0800 <ProtesterPark> He looks like the stereo typical old man yelling @ kids to get off his lawn  https://t.co/cUkhfRhPw4

1324174284609196032 2020-11-05 10:18:46 +0800 <ProtesterPark> And her pancake make up is about 3 shades too light
1324173977904971776 2020-11-05 10:17:32 +0800 <ProtesterPark> As Sister Margret Mary always said, "Patience is a virtue."  Not sure how many more rosaries I need to do before I'm blessed with that virtue. But when you win this, it will be worth all of the Hail Mary's.

1323471976934088705 2020-11-03 11:48:02 +0800 <ProtesterPark> @BradleyWhitford Someone should put Miralax in his coffee
1323470792559153152 2020-11-03 11:43:20 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Oh dear God!  Someone please end his 15 minutes of fame.

1323439974340038656 2020-11-03 09:40:52 +0800 <ProtesterPark> I gave him his walking papers nearly 2 weeks ago.
1323399468075634693 2020-11-03 06:59:55 +0800 <ProtesterPark> It's those precious moments that restore my faith.

1322719118445957121 2020-11-01 09:56:27 +0800 <ProtesterPark> All they can do is get close.  Still can't touch this.  The Trump escort for the main event of Biden Harris Hegar was amazing.  So glad trump supporter realize their place. Chasing 1st place.
1322717745633517571 2020-11-01 09:51:00 +0800 <ProtesterPark> You should have that same talk with your boss.
1322717361233940486 2020-11-01 09:49:28 +0800 <ProtesterPark> We all know he's a no good dirty rotten cheater.  He can't get anything without cheating-wife, girlfriend, stripper, SAT score, hotel, casino...Cheater Cheater Pumpkin Eater. No wonder he's orange.
1322716358505877506 2020-11-01 09:45:29 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Very well said.  Brayden is an inspiration.
1322692095497424896 2020-11-01 08:09:04 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Insane
1322691870816952324 2020-11-01 08:08:11 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Good choice
1322521687259308034 2020-10-31 20:51:56 +0800 <ProtesterPark> As if 2020 didn't suck enough, it had to kill Sean.  2020 will definitely get a bad Yelp review.
1322324178360537090 2020-10-31 07:47:06 +0800 <ProtesterPark> He's just upset he's not Stephen King
1321995975251156997 2020-10-30 10:02:56 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Does Kathryn knit?  She looks like a knitter.
1321938863124848641 2020-10-30 06:16:00 +0800 <ProtesterPark> I can not stop laughing. Brillant!
1321585883594850305 2020-10-29 06:53:23 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Did they make a movie called "The Red Sparrow" to describe women like her?
1320905288657084416 2020-10-27 09:48:56 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Reckoning Day Nov 3rd
1320905102635532290 2020-10-27 09:48:12 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Reckoning Day Nov 3rd
1320547394711334912 2020-10-26 10:06:48 +0800 <ProtesterPark> We're trying.
1320343198225600512 2020-10-25 20:35:23 +0800 <ProtesterPark> How about waking up on Nov 4th to find out Joe Biden &amp; MJ Hegar are going to Washington!
1320342487521701889 2020-10-25 20:32:34 +0800 <ProtesterPark> That's definitely the one
1320341612975763456 2020-10-25 20:29:05 +0800 <ProtesterPark> And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’
1320341166970314752 2020-10-25 20:27:19 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Me either
1320340618841903104 2020-10-25 20:25:08 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Nothing genuine about her
1320340509206941698 2020-10-25 20:24:42 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Even the real one is a knock off
1320338819493801984 2020-10-25 20:17:59 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Ayyup
1320337598729064455 2020-10-25 20:13:08 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Wish they were in line with me to vote.
1320337256230670336 2020-10-25 20:11:47 +0800 <ProtesterPark> DEPLORABLE

1319669874315198472 2020-10-23 23:59:50 +0800 <ProtesterPark> What's happening here folks?  https://t.co/suQUHFPsoF
1319383891246014464 2020-10-23 05:03:27 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Wags for sure
1316566382688034816 2020-10-15 10:27:40 +0800 <ProtesterPark> No longer scared.  We're fire up!
1316566076935802881 2020-10-15 10:26:28 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Challenge accepted..  Harris County had a quarter of a million people vote in 2 days.  We're bringing it.
1316477505310777347 2020-10-15 04:34:30 +0800 <ProtesterPark> I heard he frequents the Waffle House in Clemson.  Maybe someone there will have something.
1316110889670631426 2020-10-14 04:17:42 +0800 <ProtesterPark> My husband &amp; I voted today. Just found out from my son that the polls were down. Some of the machines were smoking. I hope my vote got counted.
1314629549389471744 2020-10-10 02:11:23 +0800 <ProtesterPark> But then that means we'll have another year of HIM
1314036332411400194 2020-10-08 10:54:09 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Jeff Goldblum of course

1314029369124364288 2020-10-08 10:26:29 +0800 <ProtesterPark> He looks constipated
1314025135737843712 2020-10-08 10:09:40 +0800 <ProtesterPark> He really has womb envy
1314024387931254784 2020-10-08 10:06:42 +0800 <ProtesterPark> So sick of the mansplaining.
1314024224974163969 2020-10-08 10:06:03 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Waited an hour too long &amp; she didn't lay it down hard enough because he's still rolling over her.  Just shows he he has no respect for women on any level.
1314023941728538624 2020-10-08 10:04:55 +0800 <ProtesterPark> His pompascity is underwhelming
1314021115950510080 2020-10-08 09:53:42 +0800 <ProtesterPark> He looks like Bob Costa did @the Russian Olympics when he got pink eye from a hotel towel.
1314020830192586752 2020-10-08 09:52:33 +0800 <ProtesterPark> I almost long for the days of Moynihan, Tip O'Neil...
1314018375950049285 2020-10-08 09:42:48 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Already sick of him being disrespectful to the moderator.
1314016651529121792 2020-10-08 09:35:57 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Clearly Pence forgot his Visine.
1314016080457760768 2020-10-08 09:33:41 +0800 <ProtesterPark> He looks like he knows that DJT is already gonna be yelling @ him for getting upstaged
1314015566491987970 2020-10-08 09:31:38 +0800 <ProtesterPark> I have never heard so many people today say they were rushing home to watch a debate much less a VP debate.  She looks &amp; sounds great. She's ready.  He looks unable to even hold her door.
1314014533204275201 2020-10-08 09:27:32 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Watching with a bowl of popcorn &amp; a Slurpee.
1314014055112245252 2020-10-08 09:25:38 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Or the Slime machine from Nickelodeon.   He did want to drain the swamp.
1314013828838031360 2020-10-08 09:24:44 +0800 <ProtesterPark> He knows he's on a sinking ship.  It's like watching him play in the band on the Titanic.
1314013012756439041 2020-10-08 09:21:30 +0800 <ProtesterPark> He can't answer a question if his life depended on it.
1313846741289009155 2020-10-07 22:20:47 +0800 <ProtesterPark> I want one of those

1313570351616532481 2020-10-07 04:02:31 +0800 <ProtesterPark> I'm thinking that the word "Deplorable" was too mild.  Thoughts?
1313282270455832578 2020-10-06 08:57:47 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Poop to that!
1313128007419265030 2020-10-05 22:44:48 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Or bleach
1312444542839263233 2020-10-04 01:28:57 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Will you work towards lowering HC premiums for those who do not qualify for reductions based on income? I cannot afford $2500/mth in premiums for a famy of 4 with a $16,000 deductible on a $100,000/yr income &amp; own a home &amp; put my kids through college. Not too mention car payments

1312049999904153603 2020-10-02 23:21:11 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Or D.  Both B and C are true.
1311827428222828544 2020-10-02 08:36:46 +0800 <ProtesterPark> And they probably won't wave the tolls as I drive into town to drop off my ballot.
1311701945531404290 2020-10-02 00:18:08 +0800 <ProtesterPark> @chipfranklin Principled
1311700969965654018 2020-10-02 00:14:16 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Boom
1311700405433380868 2020-10-02 00:12:01 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Don't let the door hit you on the way out
1311364776795287553 2020-10-01 01:58:21 +0800 <ProtesterPark> So after last night's debate, I'm gonna binge watch all of The West Wing episode for the 3rd time since this A-hole has been in office.
1311140062143418369 2020-09-30 11:05:25 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Looking forward to watching you destroy Mike Pence on the debate stage.

1311110903266410496 2020-09-30 09:09:33 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Vodka or Whiskey?
1309998280869326849 2020-09-27 07:28:23 +0800 <ProtesterPark> But when are the current Trump officials gonna speak out...
1307818994884317184 2020-09-21 07:08:41 +0800 <ProtesterPark> It's time for all women of every age &amp; color to be NOTORIOUS!
1307818717741486082 2020-09-21 07:07:35 +0800 <ProtesterPark> My grandmother's rosary beads have been getting a work out.
1307818566109073413 2020-09-21 07:06:58 +0800 <ProtesterPark> I plan on being there the 1st day of early voting.  I plan on being the 1st person in the door.  I plan on voting for Biden.
1307818304199962631 2020-09-21 07:05:56 +0800 <ProtesterPark> I can only hope &amp; pray.
1306419316829585409 2020-09-17 10:26:51 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Please keep doing this.  Please keep showing young girls the power within themselves &amp; the power when we unite together.
1306258275407663104 2020-09-16 23:46:56 +0800 <ProtesterPark> I love the self-confidence.  I'm gonna have to increase my shoe budget though.  Keep up that confident stride.
1305189401736228865 2020-09-14 00:59:37 +0800 <ProtesterPark> I've been thinking that for weeks.  When is Netflix gonna pick up the original mini series?
1303830638299144193 2020-09-10 07:00:22 +0800 <ProtesterPark> DJT has all the charisma of Randall Flagg &amp;the death count too.
1303013497937301505 2020-09-08 00:53:21 +0800 <ProtesterPark> Yet 20.6 million jobs lost due to your poor management of the Covid crisis.  So your actual numbers are a negative 10 million jobs created.  Check your math.  No wonder you had someone take your SAT for you.
