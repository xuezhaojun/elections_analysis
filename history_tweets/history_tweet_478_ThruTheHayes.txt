The LIE of equality permeates the dogs world as it does the human world. The lie is all dogs can he saved, can make nice pets, will be thankful for being rescued. Claiming the dog has lab or golden as opposed to pit or chow is common.

Whilst saps are busy "saving" dogs (who don't need them nor saving), humans slip through the cracks.  Your moronic compassion is showing.

Shelters &amp; rescues import dogs from around the world and burden 1st world people with street trash; that liked the street better.  Breeds aren't more important because they are healthier but because they are more predictable in temperament.

Rescue and shelter workers are 99.9% emotional saps and on the lower half of the IQ spectrum (they work with dogs for free).  They are emotional hustlers selling false promises.

1339993294940549120 2020-12-19 01:57:52 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> When power is distributed(shifted) command follows. Covid ought to have proved that to everyone. Once distributed properly, commands that are proper follow.  We get chaotic wide spread revolution otherwise.  And it's gonna come in the dark, white winter.

1339993291144769536 2020-12-19 01:57:51 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> White collar people can put skin in the game by stiffing their debtors and quitting their jobs.

Cause some dumb shit is gonna act on it and throw this place into a deadly feedback loop with unpredictable externalities.  So, we ought all decide to act on the leverage now.

1337456785666547713 2020-12-12 01:58:41 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Why fight at all; cooperation is on the table. We won't be dragging anyone kicking and screaming this time; we'll be leaving you behind. And frankly deep down, you fear that most.  We can pursue righteousness and the few evil actors can be made to pay the most costly of prices.
1337456784479580161 2020-12-12 01:58:40 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> You can be an active part in the good order &amp; optimal rule to follow; you can be a silent bystander reorienting to new reality; or you can be an enemy combatant during the reciprocal[righteous]{unmeasured asymmetric correction for purposeful irreciprocity[evil][} equilibration.
1337456783204429828 2020-12-12 01:58:40 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> The choice: go home; starve the system; re-educate; participate.  The offer: afford for disassociation for those who refuse to bear the cost of your ir-reciprocal choices[lie, cheat, steal, kill as you wish].  Revolution, renaissance, golden age.
1337456782021636096 2020-12-12 01:58:40 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> See there's a choice to be made. There's an offer on the table. The first choice can be made to make the need for that offer to go away; neglecting that choice you can take the offer(it's actually a good one); denying that offer designates you an evil enemy.
1337456780138438669 2020-12-12 01:58:39 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Understand they owe you no quarter. Those you label deplorables(roughly). They call you degenerates and it's they who have a case. They can testify to their warranted disgust of you; however your hatred of them is irrational. It is only they that afford for your emergence.  https://t.co/UENYTdzWD9
1337456775709253633 2020-12-12 01:58:38 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> AND lucky for us; you're recently 12 months practiced at this very skill. This time however; you must quiet the system AND re-educate. See, you'll be changed or eliminated. This is ALWAYS the way; you've adapted to this place thus far, but the environment is about to change fast.
1337456774417444871 2020-12-12 01:58:38 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> When that happens the silence will be delivered but not by "those who are muted"s choice. The quiet is determined. However, there is no set or commanded means of achieving it. I suggest we shut the parasitic system down and re-group. All this requires is going and staying home.
1337456773171736576 2020-12-12 01:58:38 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Silence is golden AND it can and will deliver the golden age. How we acquire this silence is all of what the fuss is about. And if you're paying attention closely those who can make everybody shut-up... they can afford to wait til the last moment to strike; and they will.
1337456771724697600 2020-12-12 01:58:37 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> You can stop; you can stop slaving &amp; you can stop becoming indebted further. Being a wage and debt slave in this current landscape of chaos and delusion is a choice, truly. And not choosing slavery becomes easier each time someone new denies power to those with whips and chains.
1337456770084691972 2020-12-12 01:58:37 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> People act at work for others to abuse those in their proximity for free. Life isn't business it's survival. Wages are something that the slaves complain about. Real capital isn't accumulated by slaving; but by ruling. How'd that get lost on everyone? Wages are extraction.
1337456768922824705 2020-12-12 01:58:37 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> You can't stop lying; so stop speaking, stop virtue signaling. Do so long enough that those you've lied to and wronged forget your infractions. Better yet; atone for them. Start asking; "how can I help you?" to friends and family and STOP asking that in business &amp; to strangers.
1337456767412957184 2020-12-12 01:58:36 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Revolution comes. It comes because historic cycles say so; because current trends say so; because economic analysis says so; because demographic reality says so; because immigration policy says so; because religious super-organisms say so... no you don't know.  Some do. Not you.
1337456218663768065 2020-12-12 01:56:25 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> AN OFFER ONE OUGHTN'T REFUSE  Revolution, renaissance, golden age.  Why fight this?  The divide between the factions(actual) isn't right and left. That's a trick to pit men against women. It's reciprocity(eugenic) vs. ir-reciprocity(dysgenic).  Pay attention; you've been fooled.  https://t.co/9fvt5E6BpH

1337039764214718464 2020-12-10 22:21:35 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> And by squeezing the bad actors out of the realm of production, because, by definition, bad is unproductive, the landscape that affords for evil unfolding will shrink.

1333786564963442694 2020-12-01 22:54:32 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Good ideas create cooperation and flourishing, not division and turmoil. That's,... like,... the definition of "good ideas." Given the way the landscape of ideas appears, Humans are operating with bad ones, it's time to let those go. And have some perspective on past immaturity.
1333786563637960705 2020-12-01 22:54:31 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> ...based on a single opinion(tweet; post; past; present) or alleged(actually baseless) event.  The ideas that grip our culture currently are playing out as they will. Meaning there isn't any altering of outcomes without completely altering the ideas that drive action. Deep ideas.
1333786562354548744 2020-12-01 22:54:31 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> People need others so badly that we have mobs of them throwing others under buses to gain social capital; virtue signalling epidemic. That is evidence of Humans seeking Humans to be on their side. It's being done in an inhumane way; smearing people's reputations in public...
1333786560588783619 2020-12-01 22:54:31 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> This is a foolish debate. For one can't survive without the other, there must be a balance between concentration in order to manifest progress of any kind.  Current technology has convinced us that we need each other a whole lot less than we actually do.
1333786559305318411 2020-12-01 22:54:30 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Ideas that are gripping their psyche? Is China's choice to correct wrong think an affront to civil rights or a necessary defense against the fall of their civilization?  There is this debate raging on: whether we ought to center societies around the collective or the individual.
1333786557975654401 2020-12-01 22:54:30 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Many are calling this an egregious affront to civil rights.  Assuming what I wrote above has a splinter of truth to it, I'm not alone; @GadSaad describes Islam, roughly, as a perfect parasitic Memeplex. Is this not an effective way to deal with people who have dangerous ideas?
1333786556289609730 2020-12-01 22:54:30 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> [ https://t.co/HPTKQzT8iY]( https://t.co/QwagswBPB2)
1333786554955821057 2020-12-01 22:54:29 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Your actions will have unpredictable long term consequences. That doesn't mean they will be negative although they usually are.  Now to current events; China is choosing to deal with a set of ideas that grip people and destroy every civilization they touch with prejudice:
1333786553416523779 2020-12-01 22:54:29 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> When you pick your own "religion," that is, not action in accordance to created religious dogma. You eschew evolutionary wisdom regarding action. You set forth consequences the world isn't prepared for. This is because your mode of being hasn't been accounted for in totality.
1333786552061681664 2020-12-01 22:54:29 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> This brings us to religion. You ARE religious. You're a religious being admitted or not. You have a routine (roughly) and you believe that routine is correct, due to you carrying it out faithfully. Most repeat routines dogmatically. The work week/weekend cycle comes to mind.
1333786550828601351 2020-12-01 22:54:28 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Ideas come with actions, actions come with consequence. Ideas unfurl to their logical end, on their own accord, using purveyors of parts of the idea to carry out the "plan". Enough people doing small parts of large ideas will see the entirety of the idea play out in the world.
1333786549515763714 2020-12-01 22:54:28 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> ...pick any idea you have: now attempt to explain how that idea isn't more complete than your understanding of it; explain where it came from &amp; how you can be in possession of something likely older &amp; more complicated than you &amp; claim to have it as opposed to it having you.
1333786548274307079 2020-12-01 22:54:28 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> We make choices of action positing a "better." We all want something better; we are striving creatures, we can't help it.  This being said; most people they don't have any ideas. Ideas have them. Go ahead and think hard...
1333786547066339329 2020-12-01 22:54:28 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> SOME IDEAS ARE BAD AND SHOULD BE ERADICATED  It's very easy to judge and do so poorly. Humans are built to value certain things over others. This sets up a landscape of value judgments. Doing this as opposed to that; seeking this as opposed to that etc.

1333780859871178752 2020-12-01 22:31:52 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Believe that saying what you mean and meaning it and accepting the consequences for meaning it is the only thing one must believe in. The list is short. Speak honestly and act reciprocally:   https://t.co/wkkYpllIVM
1333780858898165763 2020-12-01 22:31:51 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> It's very easy to get on the right side of this thing. You need to observe in order to orient. Which means you must be quiet. I know, not your strong suit; but just watch and listen. I promise this will deliver you a better future.  You admit not knowing what to believe.
1333780857933471744 2020-12-01 22:31:51 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> As you age you brain filters more and more of the world out. It's your brain's job. It takes constant effort to keep an open mind and some judgement to know an open mind is only good to be shut on things tightly.  You have to strip your filters of pretense. They are had in error.

1330245580086505473 2020-11-22 04:23:55 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> IT'S NOT JUST NOT TRUE; IT'S DEMONSTRABLY FALSE  Ah, cause you're liars. It's not "my truth"; the Truth IS, it isn't someone's to have. You can speak in concordance with it; but it's always only a proxy for it. Most of what people say is frivolous narrative and the rest is false.

1330236012568711178 2020-11-22 03:45:54 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> @EricRWeinstein @MaajidNawaz @benshapiro @SamHarrisOrg @RubinReport @BretWeinstein "Trump wins when he divides us."   This ISN'T True; it's false.  Which makes this: "Out of vanity, I’m not losing to Trump." a horrid problem you ought deal with.  There's one frame where you position intellectually holds water and you're NOT holding that frame.
1330234271219535879 2020-11-22 03:38:59 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Only the hunters have a say. And the hunters only monitor wolves because shepherds bring them wool and meat(that's mutton and lamb) and sheep "aren't there thing."  Sheep are uncomfortable with hunters; that's a sure thing... but they ought not bleat whilst they are present.
1330234269738938370 2020-11-22 03:38:59 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> in the sense that there IS threat. They are however wrong about who and what that threat is, where it's coming from, and how it's threatening them because, well; because obviously, weren't you reading?!  Sheep don't get a say; and those who they elect oughtn't neither.
1330234268342214657 2020-11-22 03:38:58 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> And it is... dire. But, you've shorted the metaphor.   You need hunters.   Your sheep, many wolves in your clothing; you don't have sheepdogs you have lupine impostors; and your shepherd; you've convinced the others he's non-essential.  Those crying wolf are correct this time...
1330234266387685376 2020-11-22 03:38:58 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> The shepherd only offers you landscapes(by the way, the ones your's are offering are barren). The wolves determine the territory the shepherd chooses and only the efficacy of the sheepdogs affords for dangerous proximity.  If our metaphorical landscape is laid this is dire.
1330234264911294464 2020-11-22 03:38:57 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> None of the bleating you've ever done has done anything more than prove you're sheep; and getting others to bleat along side you isn't some effort of massive proportions; lying in unison is enough. The lie is that the sheep get a say. When the shepherd doesn't even get a say.
1330234263615246338 2020-11-22 03:38:57 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> You're a hazard to yourself; which is why you warn of hazards everywhere around you. As just being is hazardous for you, self-purported. When you're a hazard to yourself even those who remove hazard for a living you're hazard to. What are you gonna make of that? Shut your mouth.
1330234262176534533 2020-11-22 03:38:57 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> AND everybody knows this! So, why is it that the response to the real threats aren't being taken seriously.  The sliver of freedom and liberty you had left is being proportioned out evermore thinly. But, as long as they are equal and equally thin all will be fine, yes? No.
1330234260700229636 2020-11-22 03:38:56 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> You don't yell "fire!" when there's a fire. You put it out; &amp; if you can't put it out you find some one to &amp; if you can't find someone to you move to a safe distance &amp; alert others to find someone. None of this requires yelling fire. Inciting people even legally can cause harm...
1330234259303493632 2020-11-22 03:38:56 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> The only way you maintain fitness into the is by obscuring what is real so the agents can't properly measure value. Which is technically, literally, and obviously lying.  I just said a crying wolves choir. You hear it? Loud ain't it? Note: the decibel level; it's noise.
1330234257948745728 2020-11-22 03:38:56 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> You're unfit. It's a common mantra round here. But, if you were fit, meaning you were enough; then your future would be bleak because your future would be your present necessarily and perpetually.
1330234256422039552 2020-11-22 03:38:55 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> The more intelligent one is the more collisions one can detect. That's simultaneous pattern recognition; accounting for the agents as such; their limits; and their incentive bound choice as well as the movement of herds/super-organisms moving about planes both real and abstract.
1330234255151075332 2020-11-22 03:38:55 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> The wolves are here! You've just badly underestimated their ability to wear sheep's clothing; forgetting altogether they could more easily get by as Sheepdogs. Your allegorical thinking and abstract untethered consciousness can not save you. Your meta-physics is too... meta.
1330234253804785667 2020-11-22 03:38:55 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> THE THING IS THE THREATS ARE REAL  Plenty of highly functioning humans detect threat. And detect it everywhere. Problem being: all the other dysfunctional humans have been saying everything's a threat since they've been given a say. We've had a constant chorus of crying wolf.
1330226073972461569 2020-11-22 03:06:25 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> @NoahRevoy @limitlessleila Counter-intuitive and correct.

We need a holding of both masculine and feminine but often the expression ISN'T mixed it's specialized.  @Sean_Boom (good thread; this guy frames like you)

In order to have both we have to allow &amp; afford for specialization and THEN interplay. Not a meshing &amp; sharing of the load. By attending to what we specialize in &amp; then trading we add more for each other.  Balancing at the extremes...

1329122227917303809 2020-11-19 02:00:07 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> @BretWeinstein There are lots of options to re-instantiate an optimum here; we can't continue to abuse one another, however.
1329102446224928768 2020-11-19 00:41:31 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> But, if you can't/won't step-up; nor will you quit, or stop following the rules... certainly don't attempt to broaden those rules and wield them against others. This will make the humans very upset. Question your OWN authority then proceed with caution to others. Truth is enough.
1329102445256052743 2020-11-19 00:41:31 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Stop following the rules; they aren't there to help nor suit, nor properly sort you; but to enrich the rule makers. Quit. You'll be happier; more agentic; in better company, &amp; nimble for the coming chaos. They don't have the numbers and they insist on vacationing. Step-up.
1329102444031250438 2020-11-19 00:41:30 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Rules are made to bend: they are to bend those with-in the game to better suit the agent towards cooperation and shared aims; but, also, since we make the rules they are there to tweak so that they provide the proper constraints; as agents change those(constraints) do also.
1329102443171475456 2020-11-19 00:41:30 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> You don't even have to think up your own games. Just cease to play theirs. All those that create barriers to entry and roadblocks to progress; bury them in phone calls and paperwork, demand they do their jobs; you have the time to pressure them out of existence.
1329102442282307586 2020-11-19 00:41:30 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> If we'd played better games people wouldn't cheat, they wouldn't circumvent or parasitize upon other games. But, our games are garbage; zero-sum, equilibrated by violence. The foundational landscape being the war of all against all is returning. You can't win.
1329102441426661381 2020-11-19 00:41:30 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> You can't win. And I don't mean that in some nihilistic sense. I mean even winning the games as presented relegates one to criminal parasitism. Hence those you look up to being crooks and thieves.  Change the rules. That's what humans do. That's what sets us apart.
1329102440571023363 2020-11-19 00:41:30 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> YOU KNOW THE GAME IS RIGGED. YET, NOT ONLY DO YOU STILL PLAY, YOU FOLLOW THE RULES  Insanity, delusion, selfishness, and familiar comfort. Understand that familiarity breed contempt. Thus is the power of proximity. Question is; who's thresholds won't be breached? You ought move.

Those who don't lead themselves claim that others are lead by anyone but themselves.  The internet is more a mirror than anything else. Some people can look straight in. Others not so much.

1328752288677191680 2020-11-18 01:30:07 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Diligence is due and judgement is near; diligence can bring forgiveness; but failure to do so, especially failure due to arrogance and moral posturing fed to you by disinformation, will see you suffer righteous consequence. This isn't political posturing; it's future telling.
1328752287653769221 2020-11-18 01:30:07 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> You WISH I was making it up. But, my mind doesn't do that. I don't produce fiction. I don't inhabit any fantasy. My errors lied once in due diligence and twice in lies. Your errors lie in billions of lies and failure to understand what diligence on this mortal plain requires.
1328752286647132160 2020-11-18 01:30:06 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> And wiping each other out doesn't include all the ways that nature can and will attempt to wipe us out. We have real problems: we let Pandora out of the box, democracy is mob rule, mid-wits run by elites own the institutions given the right to steal from you...
1328752285502091265 2020-11-18 01:30:06 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> A massive judgement is coming; and I don't mean the one that's going to cause the liberals to cry oceans of tears {if he loses the oceans will be more vast; you're not cute}, I mean the one the equilibrates the human and natural landscapes. We'll wipe each other out at this rate.
1328752284474503171 2020-11-18 01:30:06 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Failure to do due diligence has consequence when one must judge and one MUST. To move about this landscape one requires value judgements to be made. You're not wise enough to make them &amp; your culture isn't robust enough to set proper limits. Yet, you think we're on the up and up?
1328752283362975757 2020-11-18 01:30:06 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> I'll let you onto a bit of a secret. It's your tolerance of the intolerance of judgement that has blinded you to its permeation throughout each and every facet of reality. Each and all judge all and every each and every moment.
1328752282209579008 2020-11-18 01:30:05 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Also, how are you going to guess you'd escape it without consequence. Look, I'm easily fooled(temperamentally); admittedly... I understand full well you can cheat others and the rules; but only the ones of humanities doing; nature and God have a set of rules one can't escape.
1328752281047740416 2020-11-18 01:30:05 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> But, it's not one. It's ALL. You're the result of an unbroken chain of reproduction spanning through history and landing you squarely in the now. Who exactly are you to break that chain. By what decree do you get to decry that life can end with you.
1328752279512608768 2020-11-18 01:30:05 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Well if it is one; aren't you, for certain, due judgement with-in it? Did you think you'd forgo that process. What kind of trial would you like to have? That's the smarter question. And forget the one that God's gonna bring you, that one is the flaming sword no doubt.
1328752277822312450 2020-11-18 01:30:04 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> You all hold tolerance in such high regard. You won't be able to tolerate your judgement. And you can't think it's not coming. What kind of time frame do you think your life operates with-in?  Forget that, I know you think one. Obviously. I, mean, it IS obviously one, right?
1328752276379488258 2020-11-18 01:30:04 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> DUE DILIGENCE IS DUE; JUDGEMENT LOOMS EERILY   Overlook handicaps and cultural pressures; peer pressures even; matters not, y'all just lie. I don't mean failure to do due diligence, but the outright refusal to and framing it as though diligence being forewent is morally superior.

1328432972643635207 2020-11-17 04:21:16 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Fascist is fastest because it chooses to judge; to decide &amp; to act; death respects nothing less. Fascists choose righteousness; it's what sets them apart. Evil commands correction; men don't fear evil, they fear God; that's why they ought choose to do his work.
1328432971687358465 2020-11-17 04:21:16 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> We forgotten how to judge; another side effect of pervasive tolerance. Some of us have the stomach for it, understanding that we will be judged by the same unwavering metric.  They want the hand of their fathers, brothers, and husbands bringing it to them not the hand of god.
1328432970701688835 2020-11-17 04:21:15 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Communism and Capitalism don't account nor afford for commons.   The three need to be solved at once in tri-functionality. Care, production, protection.   The law mediates each arena not allowing parasitism with-in nor between; no individual achieve at the expense of (br)others.
1328432969745387521 2020-11-17 04:21:15 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> ...ignoring property preference. That's forgoing biased asymmetric competitive pursuit for cooperation. Its a method with calculable limits that can act as the constant (solving ethics &amp; morals); leaving action and choice to agents; who demonstrate choosing commons if afforded.
1328432968726179851 2020-11-17 04:21:15 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> PART THREE: THE THIRD WAY IS THE ONLY WAY  Well, firstly, what are the two ways?   Communism and Capitalism; a garbage illusory scale of human interaction.   Reciprocity and parasitism better divides the landscape; and it happens to pit the good against the bad...
1328432967698538500 2020-11-17 04:21:15 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Evilness doesn't require reciprocity. Evil ir-reciprocity commands action not measured, just calculated.  See, what's coming is exactly that; it won't be measured but it will be calculated. And whether it comes from man or God it's all the same.
1328432966742257666 2020-11-17 04:21:15 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Knowing good or evil isn't a feat of imagination as we'd have shorted our spectra. Righteousness was wrongly left to God. As we can have God's laws mediated by righteous men; or we'll have man's laws mediated by God.
1328432965651718145 2020-11-17 04:21:14 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Justice requires ir-reciprocity be reconciled. A calculated and measured consequence for violations of natural law in the proportion necessary to re-instantiation equilibrium. Some property can't be replaced.
1328432964628328448 2020-11-17 04:21:14 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> You have the illusions of knowledge of good and evil; what is it everyone thinks the devils trick is? He sold that lie to you. It's the one you buy? His greatest trick is not convincing you he doesn't exist but removing his existence from your perception with a false promise.
1328432963588141057 2020-11-17 04:21:14 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> And here we tilt and tune the world for directionality toward evil; and then we let the amoral herd move about the landscape as if it were made for them. Expecting them to what? Not become evil; but we have the knowledge of good and evil...
1328432962614996996 2020-11-17 04:21:14 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Reciprocal action would do if it weren't for a single hitch. Evil. See, I don't believe death, evil; something ubiquitous that can't be extinguished... death is a worthy foe. Evilness however, isn't worthy; not even of consideration other than to expel it.
1328432961595772932 2020-11-17 04:21:13 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> PART 2: The first mover is entropy so you're stuck with righteous reaction to chaos or death. -@ThruTheHayes   "For 'Righteous reaction" replace with, or expand with a three or four-word phrase explain what kind of reaction."
1328432960593424387 2020-11-17 04:21:13 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> We have much bad. We have less evil than people think, but that's coming too. proper dicta being optimal. We have the tools for it. People understand the "logos" and we understand operational language, limits, and testimony.  It's a transition plan. It's not even a messy one.
1328432959402205184 2020-11-17 04:21:13 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> And just like brains that do this more quickly they create more robust and resilient networks.  Facebook quote: #2:  "Removal of parasitism affords high-trust which affords adaptive velocity. We are not first we are fastest."  The fastest at removing the bad. Or "order."
1328432958349455360 2020-11-17 04:21:13 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> [These were not referenced but I'm referencing them here] Facebook quote #1: "The third way is the only way. Fascist is fastest. It's chaos otherwise; and y'all aren't faring well thus far."  The West was fastest; that's their advantage. They adapt faster. They OODA more quickly.
1328432957376311298 2020-11-17 04:21:12 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Decidability begins a a trial. As in "trial and error" yes, but it's also a trial of natural law; it's assured action with causal consequence.

Meaning you dictate and steer you attention and actions toward ends you can control that have positive feedback loops built in for you and those in your proximity(read: family).
1328432955044356097 2020-11-17 04:21:12 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> PART 1: ""fascist is fastest" for what?"  Fascist is fastest (read: optimal; fastest cause it makes choices and accepts consequences as they are) for re-ordering political order; civilizational maneuvering; order of polity; and optimal for wartime(present) as it's hierarchical.

1327629584678981633 2020-11-14 23:08:53 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Your anonymity feeds your animal poorly timed rewards; trains your animal to forgo costs it can shift to other herd members... your animalistic anonymity masquerading as individuality will see you culled as your herd ought to be. Those culling won't care to differentiate.
1327629583512788999 2020-11-14 23:08:53 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> You're unfit to be an individual because you demand and seek, the comfort and camouflage of the herd.

1327629578802782210 2020-11-14 23:08:52 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> So, being anonymous makes you "just one of the animals" and as just one of the animals I expect animal action; and I am very seldom disappointed in that regard. Y'all are savages. And I don't mean int he clever internet way.
1327629577871630337 2020-11-14 23:08:52 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Yeah but science says your choices aren't free. That's correct; they are constrained; sometimes tightly. But, you can ALWAYS choose to deny the animal; deny its desires and drives... and that's the distinction. Action based in agency not biological necessity.

1327618757678784514 2020-11-14 22:25:52 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> See, a vote is a say in what to do. Your decisions don't even make things better for you. You oughtn't get a vote; your voice isn't worth being heard, as your herd bleats for you just fine. Whilst they bleat, they're being prepared to be shorn.
1327618756835684354 2020-11-14 22:25:52 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Politics is war by other means; you don't get to pretend you're not wielding violence. You vote for violence. We know this because when violence is wielded on your behalf you sit back and watch. You justify the burning.
1327618755984232449 2020-11-14 22:25:52 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> There don't exist arguments for full franchise voting that aren't tantamount to stealing. All those saying "vote them out"... ah, y'all voted them in and yous haven't changed. You probably oughtn't get a vote. Is your expertise in governance, macro economics, morality, military?
1327618755195756545 2020-11-14 22:25:51 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> EVERYONE SHOULD GET A VOTE, NOT  That says; you demand to have a say and everyone else should too. You know like a child would say given the choice. But, when is it time for the children to choose? Should every vote count or not? Clearly NOT! Many can't relay a cogent position
1327616060548390912 2020-11-14 22:15:09 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> DECIDIBILITY Law and governance require decidibility. Leaving it up to the mob is unwise. They often decide torches and pitchforks; whilst that my be nice when you're a part of the mob it's untenable &amp; intolerable when you're not. Decision making isn't simply avoiding paralysis.
1327614326216290306 2020-11-14 22:08:15 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> We humans are descendant from the first creatures striving toward the light. And pure light is white. We literally sought whiteness. It's only once refracted does light reflect any color at all. So, whilst all under this white hot light we ought to embrace what it offers.

1326900042398117899 2020-11-12 22:49:57 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> We have shifted recently to honoring uncommon men; uncommon men fight for uncommon causes and uncommon causes aren’t the common good. To err in this fashion; to promote this folly, is criminal.  The common man; commonly pursuing transcendence.
1326900041349525506 2020-11-12 22:49:57 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> The average man must become the common man once again; their utility is sorely and surely missing and desperately needed. It’s common men that fight for the common good; and when the common good is upheld we all thrive.
1326900040535863297 2020-11-12 22:49:56 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Uncommonality among common men is punished. There is no exceptional(exceptions) at the family’s expense.  For, common ought be sought after. Common is the institutions we share. Common is sacred. German Shepherds and Black labs are common because they are useful and predictable.
1326900039684399105 2020-11-12 22:49:56 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> ...They can’t measure the fruits of their actions so feminine praise will suffice.  See among common men there is no reason to attempt to appear uncommon; in-fact there is every reason to do the opposite. Among common men, striving to be exceptional is the norm.
1326900038757441536 2020-11-12 22:49:56 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> This is due to the non-adversarial rearing of a herd of average men. They’re all the same; and they have the participation trophies to prove it. They participate but only in the destruction; and they get ribbons (praise) to do so...
1326900037918601218 2020-11-12 22:49:56 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> The uncommon man is one that acts against the commons. Steals from them and poisons them. The present average man is an uncommon man. Uncommon for anytime but today’s day and age.
1326900037041917962 2020-11-12 22:49:56 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> For a common man is uncommon thing. And for this reason, the average man must become the common man. This is the reason for the wording “Every Man.” Because if not every man; then who? An uncommon man among common men is a parasite; a burden.
1326900036186345473 2020-11-12 22:49:55 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> THE COMMON MAN  The common man isn’t common; far from it. The common man upholds his responsibilities to the commons. This is the essence of his commonality; and that which is common in this sense make this man a very uncommon beast.

You don't need to take any pills to exit the Matrix; you have to stop taking pills. You have to stop eating and buying bullshit by the shovelful and spewing at others. And you gotta stop lying.
1326895345721368577 2020-11-12 22:31:17 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> We do this  to farm them like vegetables because it's easier(NOT BETTER!) than taming them like undomesticated beasts.

1326895344853118981 2020-11-12 22:31:17 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> We had to justify terrible news. Instead of properly panicking and taking the 6-12 week economic fallout... now we have a 12 month economic fallout with no end in sight.  We don't afford people the ability for foresight because we mire them in non-sense for nonsensical reasons.
1326895343955566593 2020-11-12 22:31:17 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> New doesn't mean good. Novel isn't a novel pursuit; it's a stupid one. Lest you're making your life a novel and written yourself in a good part.  There isn't a way to stop what's coming without stopping. Stopping in Dec. (2019) would have saved countless lives. But, we wouldn't.
1326895343066361859 2020-11-12 22:31:16 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> We have to alter this place with the people we've got. That means altering the people we've got, or shoving it off another generation. To the the children to be raised by adults behind masks and shields in some dystopian hell-scape categorized by "progress."
1326895342231674881 2020-11-12 22:31:16 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> WE'VE BEEN WARNING YOU  No one can stop what's coming. The trends keep trending evermore trendingly. You can't stop, won't stop. It's an incredible thing.  You're not going to vote your way out of a world wide demographics collapse.

1326889079854731265 2020-11-12 22:06:23 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> @DeAngelisCorey @primalpoly Yes you can.   And no one that disagreed with the loan has to pay. The school agreed to have and house the student at least for learning.  The institution ought to pay; they didn't warranty the education they sold. They stole from those kids.
1326888466697818112 2020-11-12 22:03:57 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> @CntmplteitAll @ScottAdamsSays Yes, but disgust is a mirrored projection. Because the right's disgust is without fear. Demonstrated behavior says the left IS disgusting. Everything novel; no adherence to norms; all about feeling not about outcomes. They hate order cause they lack discipline; like children.
1326887876337004545 2020-11-12 22:01:36 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> @DC_Draino @MinteeKneez Yes, and this is at LEAST the second time for rigging a presidential election on the behalf of the @DNC. Those are criminals; they require trials not options for office.

1326886900460883973 2020-11-12 21:57:44 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> @RealityRelate @ScottAdamsSays That's a clever definition but misses the mark. I'm sure a psychologist came up with that. ;) Disgust + Anger = aggression. Aggression =/= hate.  Hate is consumptive; aggression can be productive. The feminine hates because it doesn't fight. Hate is more combinatoric.
1326880057537810433 2020-11-12 21:30:32 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> @ScottAdamsSays It is revenge. The left does hatred; the right does disgust.

1326623781243277316 2020-11-12 04:32:11 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> At least can we all agree that paying degenerates to move closer to you is unwise? Especially given the pandemic risks.
1326623780295368704 2020-11-12 04:32:11 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> We with long term time preference understand when the long game is no longer viable. Especially when it is no longer viable for us.   Ir-reciprocity commands accounting. They've violated the sanctity of your favorite word; but much more importantly natural law.
1326623779276136449 2020-11-12 04:32:11 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> @realDonaldTrump there's no amount of mercy nor tolerance that'll make them like you. There isn't an overreach you aren't already guilty of in your enemy's eyes. The show going on at their pace, at the pace of our civilization unwinding, won't see a victory our side.
1326623778311430144 2020-11-12 04:32:10 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> They aren't smart enough, intrusive enough, wise enough, nor do they have enough personnel to stop us from saying enough is enough. We can deny them power.  The time we spent reacting moronically to a purposeful pandemic ought to have been spent turning this place around.
1326623777426460678 2020-11-12 04:32:10 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> American's aren't quitters, but if we do it together it isn't quitting it's a strike. The institutions are too slow to catch us if we cooperate &amp; reciprocate their undoing in unison.
1326623776545648641 2020-11-12 04:32:10 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> As fraudulent entities they owe restitution. How do you suppose your going to make them pay. Wait, it's way worse; how much are you going to continue to pay them before you decide to make them pay. [I hope you all see the leverage there].
1326623775580954624 2020-11-12 04:32:10 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> They believe the show; they believe because their eyes see it and their ears hear it. That doesn't stop the show from being fraud. And that fraud stops the show from holding water; that's being a fraud delegitimizes you. Your institutions, and authorities are fraudulent.

1326290245021732864 2020-11-11 06:26:50 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> These are vile twits we're empowering.
1326289590869766145 2020-11-11 06:24:14 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> One that preserves its landscape of Jesus-like emergence as opposed to dismantling that very landscape in His name.
1326289589976358913 2020-11-11 06:24:14 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> The time has come once again to set limits. And as man is the measure of all things; it is he that ought to set those limits. And those limits ought to lead to the form and function of a flourishing culture.
1326289589057839104 2020-11-11 06:24:13 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> To extend tolerance to those that will use tolerance against you to undermine and usurp your position is not kind, it isn’t Jesus like; it’s immoral, an insane display of ineptness and it’s no better if it’s innate {your instinct to allow others to walk all over you; agreeable.
1326289588059566114 2020-11-11 06:24:13 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> It’s irresponsible to act in this naive manner: forbearing for those that will surely act irreciprocal when given the chance. Irreciprocity IS immoral and to roll out the red carpet for its manifestation is suicide.
1326289587078127618 2020-11-11 06:24:13 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> ... some swift re-ordering… the tolerance isn’t (for)bearable any longer!
1326289586125934593 2020-11-11 06:24:13 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> We need the Jesus that flipped over tables and scolded the higher-ups of the day; we need the Jesus that proclaimed “go forth and multiple,” we need the Jesus that spat out the lukewarm, we need the Jesus that warns us of God coming back with that flaming sword of Truth to do...

We are now at a point in time where we ought to be saying do as Jesus said; not as he did [calculate like Jesus]. And we ought to be picking out specific instances to pull from:

They know EXACTLY what they do; and if they don’t it’s a failure on their behalf to correct for the error {you have the internet and the worlds information at your finger-tips; ignoramus}
1326289583320002560 2020-11-11 06:24:12 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> It is irresponsible to imitate Jesus as you ought to do more than sacrifice yourself to the greater “good”{as right now it’s the greater BAD} of humanity. As humanity isn’t what it was; and to sacrifice yourself to it (for their sins)...
1326289582405677056 2020-11-11 06:24:12 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> In order creation what IS isn’t enough. If it were, we wouldn’t be driven to produce. In a situation that needs order more of those able to unfurl order in the cosmic space are necessary one must be able to produce. We ought not have incentives that favor consumers but producers.
1326289581487108096 2020-11-11 06:24:12 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> See, Jesus provides an imitation model for the ideal under-class citizen {That is ANY dependent: men/women that lack agency, disabled, children, etc.} but, doesn’t set up an iterative, imitable, image for those needing to create order.

1326289573408878593 2020-11-11 06:24:10 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> The foundation for an agency-less ethic to disperse to an underclass was sorely lacking.  When there is proper order, acceptance and maintenance of that order is needed. With the Jesus trick one is sure not to run afoul of those with more power...
1326289572372893701 2020-11-11 06:24:09 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> And in his time; that was damn near every soul. The low/no-agency Jesus strategy works in low-trust and high-trust systems/situations. But, please understand at the time of emergence it was ONLY patriarchal systems of order in which to navigate.

1326271911685480454 2020-11-11 05:13:59 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> We've abused social media to amplify virtue signals(lies); we don't trust each other at face value; because at face value we're shallow twits.  Trust is the civilizational asset that matters most. Punishing the liars OR conflict is the only way to get it back.
1326271910712389634 2020-11-11 05:13:59 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> It'd dampen the noise so there's a chance for signal.  It'd force cooperation, introversion, disagreeableness, mindfulness, and cohesion[re-masculinization].  These massive massively connected platforms are optimal for giving orders.  Jesus people squander what they've got.

1325141283183108096 2020-11-08 02:21:16 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> - Feminine Coercion - Rallying, shaming, gossip, disapproval, Moralizing, mockery, ridicule, nagging, scolding, and character assassination to raise the emotional and social cost of disagreement and dissent without addressing their causes.
1325141282101014528 2020-11-08 02:21:16 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> - Psychoanalysis - pseudoscientifically pathologizing legitimate disagreement as a means of obtaining and exercising social control and marginalizing and silencing dissenting voices and views.
1325141281064902657 2020-11-08 02:21:15 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> - Propaganda - narrative manufacturer by sheer repetition to fill the "marketplace of ideas" with bullshit congenial to the gatekeepers who control the broadcast channels and media.
1325141279903080448 2020-11-08 02:21:15 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> - False Alarm: relentlessly fearmongering and sensationalizing maginary threats as a means of obscuring/justifying real ones. - Pilpul - disputation by sheer volume and variety of fallacy to overwhelm resistance to false and pernicious conclusions.
1325141278724673536 2020-11-08 02:21:15 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> - Blasphemy - Attacking the sacred for the purpose of subversion, undermining, the destruction of intergenerational wisdom, and the erosion of necessary and helpful moral rules.
1325139681722294273 2020-11-08 02:14:54 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> - Slander, liber and defamation - malicious lies designed to slur, marginalize, and dehumanize rivals or critics. - Obscenity - Transgression of taboos for the purpose of subversion, demoralization, and/or parasitic profit.

1325139678845079552 2020-11-08 02:14:53 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Beware of those offering you that which you didn't earn; as affording control of your acquisition of resources to others diminishes your agency and ability to remain self-determined. It undermines your autonomy and reduces your efficacy.
1325139678073327616 2020-11-08 02:14:53 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> You ask the difference? Masculine violence is physical(force) and it's illegal; unless you're an agent of the law. Feminine violence is disruption of order (chaos) and it's very legal. And it's beating the life out of our peoples and country. Deception and delusion.
1325139677070954496 2020-11-08 02:14:53 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> THE LEFT IS FASCIST ABOUT CHAOS(ENTROPY) THE WAY THE RIGHT IS ABOUT ORDER AND RIGHT NOW...

1324501333370691586 2020-11-06 07:58:20 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> ...A swath of generational capital squandered by indulging childish fantasies and hyper-consumption.  - We could transition to something dignified and peaceful. But, not at this pace; nor in this direction. Some people offer solutions... and some people afford for these problems.
1324501332468916224 2020-11-06 07:58:20 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> - So, again. No protected classes. We protect children and frame the world to mold them into more competent adults. Adults that protect civilization. So, we've been failing. These are those results...
1324501331453890561 2020-11-06 07:58:20 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> - However, there is an additional category that exists because, you know, trinities and markets in everything, yada yada; there are those outside the law. Like animals are outside the law; like out laws used to be outside the law. Able to be hunted is their category.
1324501330459828224 2020-11-06 07:58:19 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> - Just so we're all aware. There isn't any reason to have protected classes. There are only 2 classes of people when it comes to those with-in the [[law]]: criminals and non. Obvi.
1324501329205669890 2020-11-06 07:58:19 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> - THE BEE AGAIN REFUSES TO STAY IN ITS OWN LANE -  https://t.co/7OFfv4Dqsu - Not only that, it's supposed to be funny.

1324499822771056641 2020-11-06 07:52:20 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> @bierlingm Yeah, this @RoamResearch thing... it's gonna make this go faster.  "You ought be able to hunt those outside the law. Under current arbitrary rule that'd be disastrous and illegal. Your law's broke."
1324475321857572864 2020-11-06 06:14:58 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Either things get properly sorted or they get properly sordid. Disregarding the former delivers the latter. Sort it out.

1324381848391344128 2020-11-06 00:03:33 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> @NoahRevoy What percentage of the American population can even do 100 burpees in a row?
1324380690771750913 2020-11-05 23:58:57 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> As for pestilence... we can't be sure some of the persons on earth didn't already choose that one first...
1324380689588998144 2020-11-05 23:58:56 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> These are creatures only man could design. Unmake them or move them. Those are the only options. Proximity and incompatibility bring on the great leveler that is with-in the realm of men to choose... war; and they are going to choose it.
1324380688645279745 2020-11-05 23:58:56 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> We've rewarded rationalizing irrational decisions as moral goods because they reward a hyper stimulated natural impulse and the agents will fight for the right to make that choice; at their expense in the long term and the expense of others, regardless of time-frame.
1324380687697367040 2020-11-05 23:58:56 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Most people are simply poorly trained, seriously immature, and in proximity to persons and institutions that supply positive feedback to the individuals worst instincts, legitimizing them and leaving the agents to justify acting on impulse.
1324380686799773702 2020-11-05 23:58:56 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> For instance: they sell you indoctrinating pseudo-science and you pay them 100s of thousand to do it.  We're incompatible in our pursuits because we're incompatible in the amount of tyranny we'll afford for in our lives.
1324380685801586688 2020-11-05 23:58:55 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> But, that's their play. No property. That comes next. Soon as you can't defend it. And they've taken all sorts of types already. You've lost commons you didn't know you had. You lacked the tools to defend them.
1324380684891410433 2020-11-05 23:58:55 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Especially after committing treason; but even more specifically, spending 50 years in Government whist it and all its arms have been inserted in the American people's pockets.  Banning pockets is a shitty way to deter pickpockets.
1324380683981279234 2020-11-05 23:58:55 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> We have war on US soil right now. Have for a while. We have had a warlord back @JoeBiden's run for the presidency of the Untied States. See, many of us can't live near people who would take that senile old man seriously.
1324380683054231552 2020-11-05 23:58:55 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> There is no reason to increase population density amidst a global pandemic.  The US is a big land. We do not have to be in proximity to one another. We are rich enough and have plenty of stuff. Burning things to the ground renders you a terrorist last I checked.
1324380682144092160 2020-11-05 23:58:55 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Just go home. Plan to go home. Find a place, find your people; find a place, bring your people. But, don't go to where people already are. They don't want you; and they oughtn't. The pandemic is enough reason to say no.
1324380681280065536 2020-11-05 23:58:54 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> And probably rightfully so; and even if it wasn't right, it is actually felt, so it's real enough(people will act upon it).
1324380680353099777 2020-11-05 23:58:54 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Your environment is one of unfitness. You're incompatible with the constraints put upon you. Which means the rules aren't serving you. Or anyone. And we're not serving each other. Mostly because we hold one another in contempt.
1324380679447130117 2020-11-05 23:58:54 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> I mean you're demonstrably unfit right now. And I don't just mean statistically you're probably out of shape; even though that is true too. I mean you demonstrate not having the quality of life your parents did, and won't pass on the quality of life you have to your children.
1324380678461554688 2020-11-05 23:58:54 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Y'all live too close to one another to try and pull off what you're trying to pull off. Woefully unfit to take on the cognitive burdens of super-powered stasi and sophisticated misinformation as well as massive amounts of mindless misdirection...
1324380677559717888 2020-11-05 23:58:53 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> But, you're all going to go 1984/A Brave New World/Animal Farm with legislative measures and spying whilst simultaneously normalizing the sexualization of children instead.
1324380676649615365 2020-11-05 23:58:53 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> For the first time we can deliver an equality that has a positive feedback mechanism built in. We have the data to analyze the agents and the technology to gift them training with active haptic feedback.
1324380675731001348 2020-11-05 23:58:53 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Only two things deliver equality consistently. Two things have a reliable track record for the socialist (read: Bolshevik) aim: equality. Those things are war and pestilence.
1324380674866978819 2020-11-05 23:58:53 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> We don't get along when we blame one another for problems. If it's not your fault you can't do anything about it; and no one is going to do it for you. Many things are true at once you know.
1324380673281576961 2020-11-05 23:58:52 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> You fail each other; you weren't failed. Your institutions failed you. They've exacerbated this incompatibility. If family blamed for proximity can destroy psyches; what do you think racism blamed for proximity will do to cities and the groups of people that inhabit them?
1324380672392335366 2020-11-05 23:58:52 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> PROXIMITY, INCOMPATIBILITY AND THE GREAT LEVELERS Proximity breeds contempt. This was Freud's fraud. He passed off the contempt of proximity for the troubles of the family. A unit one must adapt to necessarily. Sure they are the root of all your problems; they are your roots.

1324376488951586817 2020-11-05 23:42:15 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Mid-wits, nit-wits, and dim-wits make up the majority of our electorate.   The fact they'd like to grant one another a voice is irrelevant.   Their harm is calculable. So, unless they're going to be paying restitution for damages; we ought to stop their ability to damage things.
1324366679053422593 2020-11-05 23:03:16 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> @WorMartiN Haha; I got it. Just making suggestions for those following along...  Perhaps they ought to try controlling themselves before lending their opinions on how to control others. ;)

1324023739881869312 2020-11-05 00:20:33 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> 6) Facebook has a record of flaunting a personal, cultural, and political bias over the will of different nations.  Facebook as a record of avoiding these remedies even though trivial to accomplish.
1324023739017777152 2020-11-05 00:20:33 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> 5) The problem is a matter of long standing domestic public criticism and discourse, with accusations of interference in the election. The problem is a matter of long standing international criticism.
1324023738040549376 2020-11-05 00:20:32 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> 4) Facebook has evolved into the primary platform for political discourse in the world, as is evident in political use both revolutionary and conformative.

It is inexpensive for Facebook to implement the demanded remedies. 2) The court has acted similarly to Microsoft and AT&amp;T as well as others.

1323978651239698433 2020-11-04 21:21:23 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Well, cause mostly y'all are cowards playing for attention. Sticking your neck out only so much. We'll all end up on the chopping block.   I've suggested and will continue to suggest and alliance of sanity. This ought to have been easy to achieve after #Unity2020 was stifled.
1323978650207866882 2020-11-04 21:21:23 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Doesn't mean what they did to him is right. You've created an electorate that thinks like this:  https://t.co/f0NKz8lJU9 h/t @robinhanson  We're supposed to be on the same team. We afford one another the ability to fall prey to banishment from socials, why?
1323978649310298112 2020-11-04 21:21:22 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Labeling others by affiliation is a cowards game. Demonstrated behavior is the only manifest expression necessary to be judged. For instance the demonstrable cheating by the @DNC in the last couple elections. Feel free to start with the railroading of @SenSanders(SELLOUT).
1323978648194588672 2020-11-04 21:21:22 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> RADICALS AND EXTREMISTS... COWARDS DISMISS PEOPLE WITH LABELS  Your information ecology is being poisoned. And no one stands up to protect the informational commons. And as such you create ill-informed cretins.     https://t.co/WD14gm9p0u
1323975788039966723 2020-11-04 21:10:00 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> Civilizational cycles exist as such, and all historical cycles present present humans due for a catastrophe; it'll take exiting history to avoid it.
1323975787238797314 2020-11-04 21:10:00 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> All these properties matter. Specializing for focus and concentration is wise (read: optimal). To attempt to tool society so agents have to defend property they care nothing about is asking for collapse.
1323975786383183872 2020-11-04 21:10:00 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> The right established masculine property focus: Protection 1) Loyalty/betrayal: Interpersonal Property (Kinship, Ethnicity, Nationhood) 2) Authority/subversion: Institutional Property (Religion, Hierarchy, Law) 3) Sanctity/degradation: Normative Property (Norms, Manners, Ethics)
1323975785594691586 2020-11-04 21:10:00 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> The right ascendant masculine property focus: Production 1) Liberty/oppression: Lockean Property (Self-ownership, Personal property, Capital goods)
1323975784768352259 2020-11-04 21:10:00 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> The left feminine property focus: Care 1) Care/harm: Redistributive Property (Welfare, Charity, Land reform) 2) Fairness/cheating: Cooperative Property (Sharing, Antitrust laws, Sport rules)
1323975783937921024 2020-11-04 21:09:59 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> There is an optimum political order. It is derived from allowing agents to operate in reciprocal arrangements with one another. Forcing one to care about property outside of their preference affords for poor decision making.
1323975781823975425 2020-11-04 21:09:59 +0800 <ThruTheHayes> A PROPER POLITICAL LANDSCAPE  The left atomizes the right clusters.  The left creates a herd; the right creates packs.  The left focuses on care; the right production and protection.  The left leans feminine and female; the right leans masculine and male.  https://t.co/l3KFipuX8U
