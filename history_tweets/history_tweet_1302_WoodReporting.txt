1343995993193381890 2020-12-30 03:03:09 +0800 <WoodReporting> Biggest need is taking the money out of elections and getting rid of every grifting crook on K street. Plus stop the ferris wheel between governance and business.   That would end it.
1343943327020969984 2020-12-29 23:33:53 +0800 <WoodReporting> @mtaibbi Tried to post a comment on your post about New Yorker attack on Substack and it said you had deleted or that it wasn't available.

1343935727101501441 2020-12-29 23:03:41 +0800 <WoodReporting> There is no "collective interest" in journalism.   Only truth.  Your success makes them so nervous they are revealing themselves.
1343904973617319938 2020-12-29 21:01:28 +0800 <WoodReporting> Been watching the original version of All Creatures about friendship, family, animals and the warm glow of fellowship found in a fireside British pub.   BBC is so over........  Did BBC pass up All Creatures revamp because it was too WHITE?  https://t.co/tug05V34Oq via @MailOnline
1343902140042010624 2020-12-29 20:50:13 +0800 <WoodReporting> So the point of the vaccinations is what, then?  This is total lunacy.
1343899909423030272 2020-12-29 20:41:21 +0800 <WoodReporting> @sbattrawden Maybe you should be advocating for better protection of old people, who are the primary victims of COVID. Shameful that medical professionals can't see that focused protection of those would die from COVID is the only solution.
1343890981909901317 2020-12-29 20:05:53 +0800 <WoodReporting> @MLevitt_NP2013 @FatEmperor Lockdown is a popular because of media malfeasance; They push fear, outlying mortality cases, pump up + test numbers and asymptomatic transmission. This is then reflected in public poling which convinces politicians the public  wants lockdowns. Tautology.

1343660713131311104 2020-12-29 04:50:52 +0800 <WoodReporting> This looks a bit like murder.  We know who dies from COVID and they are the ones who should get the vaccine.   Wasting it on people who won't get sick is the ultimate virtue signal and a sign of mental illness within the PH culture.
1343641778155630596 2020-12-29 03:35:38 +0800 <WoodReporting> Beautiful shot.  Beautiful person.  And what a great example of courage for your kids.

1343568981811146752 2020-12-28 22:46:22 +0800 <WoodReporting> @Cernovich @ThinkThroughIt This is the point.  If you remove those numbers, it is less than seasonal flu.  Also, ask yourself, since we know who dies, why aren't they bing properly protected?  #GreatBarringtonDeclaration

City hospitals are virtually always overwhelmed with flu at this time of year. No one shrieks for a lockdown.  Better to protect the vulnerable, a very specific group.

Perhaps some hysteria now that every lung infection is COVID with + results driven by iatragenic or nocosomial infectious on top off flu.  I show you evidence; you attack me personally.

1343239287836446720 2020-12-28 00:56:17 +0800 <WoodReporting> Fauci could stop the pandemic if only he would move to actually protect old people and long term care patients - the majority of deaths from COVID.  Ask yourself why he isn't.  Ask yourself why she isn't asking him this.

1340599578769436674 2020-12-20 18:07:01 +0800 <WoodReporting> WHO has already debunked that this is a new strain.
1340599343296995332 2020-12-20 18:06:05 +0800 <WoodReporting> @BillHalliday2 @JamesMelville Please think critically. Vast majority of exposed people won't die, or even get sick. Old people who will die are not even being protected as most deaths are 85+. If James father wants to risk it, that's his choice.

1340439702680326144 2020-12-20 07:31:43 +0800 <WoodReporting> Hey, Matt  WHO now says it's not new.  Wrong again, dude.
1340438533383872514 2020-12-20 07:27:05 +0800 <WoodReporting> It's already been debunked by WHO.  Settle down.
1340437133878849538 2020-12-20 07:21:31 +0800 <WoodReporting> @FedExCanadaHelp   Doesn't engender confidence when a FedEx Canada employee in Latin America who barely speaks English asks if the trip between Edmonton+Toronto is "domestic".  FedEx takes Canadian $$ but doesn't hire Canadian workers.   Shameful.  Merry Christmas from McKinsey.

1340298236242907138 2020-12-19 22:09:35 +0800 <WoodReporting> @tom316tom @simondolan More and more people are skeptical of corporate media who are the main drivers of the fear, which in turn scares the public which drives the opinion polls which motivate politicians and PH bureaucrats.Tautology.  Remove the corporate media propaganda and the centre will collapse.
1340281300784177154 2020-12-19 21:02:17 +0800 <WoodReporting> There goes the reasoning for the lockdowns:  "The lack of substantial transmission from observed asymptomatic index cases is notable."   https://t.co/rThLvFwjQ7

Let me know what you think:  Info@trishwoodpodcast.com  Vietnam War is a good analogy. It went on for 10 years, killing 59T+ troops before anyone would admit their huge mistake.    https://t.co/IG6R08Woh0
1340274010291105792 2020-12-19 20:33:19 +0800 <WoodReporting> @tom316tom @simondolan We are all in a state of dangerous cognitive dissonance.   Cruelty is acceptable, lies are being justified, PH policy is CAUSING  deaths.  CDC shows the largest COVID mortality cohort is 85, 7 years older than the average American's lifespan!
1340270868337991682 2020-12-19 20:20:50 +0800 <WoodReporting> @tom316tom @simondolan Another good question.   Both things can be true. CCP propaganda and a deadly virus.  Our problem is we are governed by buffoons and public health officials drunk with power and refusing to change course or examine data -- like on schools.   Plus no credible media.  Bad recipe.
1340268541795311618 2020-12-19 20:11:36 +0800 <WoodReporting> @tom316tom @simondolan This is a good question and I did research the answer.   Wuhan and Northern Italy had big connections through factories for clothing so there was a HUGE viral load.   Also, shitty hospitals, aging population with lots of sickness and smoking.  But it ended quickly, too.
1340016207009865734 2020-12-19 03:28:54 +0800 <WoodReporting> @ChallahCam Hey, Tracey -- I spent a great deal of time looking at this along with @ggreenwald @mtaibbi @thefloutist among others, great reporters all plus watched the very credible Tony Bobulinksi in a long-form interview.

1339847588162506752 2020-12-18 16:18:52 +0800 <WoodReporting> @ScottAdamsSays Good question but:  We have no numerator.   And the death counts are skewed so badly by including ANY death with a positive COVID test that evaluating this way is folly.  That is why test design is key and why doctor's observational evidence is important.

RICO AND in-kind campaign donations through propaganda journalism and censorship.   Break up Big Tech, too.  These should be slam dunk legal efforts.  But the GOP sucks. Cowards.

1337356672663236609 2020-12-11 19:20:52 +0800 <WoodReporting> Corporate media deliberately covered for Joe Biden to get him elected. There is no other explanation.

Lots of chaos and corruption of counting, chain of custody signature matching and notoriously vulnerable voting and counting machines.   But we will never actually know.  So, here we are.
1336787376702709761 2020-12-10 05:38:41 +0800 <WoodReporting> Only now because they feel Biden is safely elected, will they begin reporting on Hunter. Shameful.

1316526273741627394 2020-10-15 07:48:18 +0800 <WoodReporting> @JordanSchachtel They are gaslighting for sure.  But please clarify, was the prosecutor who was fired actually investigating Burisma?  That's what I can't determine.
1316524882163888129 2020-10-15 07:42:46 +0800 <WoodReporting> @NancyRomm Plus the hard drive is said to contain dozens of Biden sketchy photos, some of which were published by the Post today.
1316524644309127169 2020-10-15 07:41:49 +0800 <WoodReporting> @NancyRomm HB had VERY serious problems with blow then.  These folks would def leave a laptop carelessly and then not pay for the repair which the shop owner says is what happened.
1316511816609140737 2020-10-15 06:50:51 +0800 <WoodReporting> Here comes the gaslighting folks.  MSM now focusing on the fired prosecutor angle of the Biden story and not what it actually exposes:  Joe Biden knew J. Biden lied about what he knew Hunter used influence with his father to make money J. Biden likely met with Hunter's contact

1316422150509727745 2020-10-15 00:54:33 +0800 <WoodReporting> @robbysoave I'm assuming this went through an editorial process at the Post, right?  Lawyers would hav asked to see the evidence, correct?  These are not anonymous sources.   They are easily checked and on the record.  Sleazy procurement, yes, but also on the record.
1316401290977648640 2020-10-14 23:31:39 +0800 <WoodReporting> This is absolutely the DEATH of journalism.  They bleated lies about Trump/Russia with no evidence.  But here is actual evidence of corruption and they want to  bury it.  Mental illness.

But the Biden who IS running knew his troubled son was running around the world making sketchy deals based on his last name + connections in DC.  Biden lied about knowing this.  You need to ask yourself why.  Then vote.

They don't talk about it. As if the public's health has nothing to do with PUBLIC HEALTH.
1316323807410479106 2020-10-14 18:23:46 +0800 <WoodReporting> @piersmorgan Keen to know why the hospital is busy now? How full was it last year at this time? How many are in for COVID? Not just tested COVID + after admission.  Gaslighting 101.
1316135715835707392 2020-10-14 05:56:21 +0800 <WoodReporting> @piersmorgan You are out to lunch.  Wrong on every aspect and desperate not to be found out.

Should we take potshots at all new cases too, for not being careful enough?  If Nancy Pelosi gets it, will there be a forensic audit of her mask wearing?  Didn't think so.

1307663534596202497 2020-09-20 20:50:56 +0800 <WoodReporting> Journalism is terminally ill.   Most of what you see is propaganda.  In Portland, activists pretend to be reporters.   Some reporters behave like activists.  But Nancy Rommelmann is one of the few capturing truth.  We're lucky to have her!    https://t.co/wZwR4vtUcx

I guess it was just so obvious we could win if Ibaka subbed in  for the final five minutes. And I learned through the Demar trade that winning must b the final goal. I was attacked then for questioning that trade.

And I bet P feels the same.  Since when is criticism of a strategy + player verboten except in Leafs-land. And we know where that leads.  Tell me you weren't screaming at the TV in the 4th.

But for the fans, the last five minutes, had a quick and obvious fix.   Did NN keep him in to save his feelings?  We loves this team. Does it love us?   My boys were devastated.
1305173099114041350 2020-09-13 23:54:50 +0800 <WoodReporting> @LeoRautins Leo, sorry for Pascal, wish him well, but this wasn't just a bad game.   Nick Nurse could have solved it by subbing Ibaka.   If basketball has become a game supported only by player's feelings, lets get Demar back.  Pascal doesn't deserve hate. But he blew it. And so did NN.

He cost us the series and that is a fact. I too, feel sorry for him but we traded loveable Demar for the same reason.  The issue isn't his feelings.  But why wasn't he pulled?

1304851047270277123 2020-09-13 02:35:07 +0800 <WoodReporting> @m_shantz Why should we have sacrificed the season for him? He should have been taken out. And should have been practicing during lockdown instead he said he never touched a basketball. The is a Vince Carter level F/up.
1304850241787756546 2020-09-13 02:31:55 +0800 <WoodReporting> @Raptors @pskills43 So glad a HUGE avoidable loss is helping Pascal grow. WTF?
1304849902443397120 2020-09-13 02:30:34 +0800 <WoodReporting> @donnovanbennett @Klow7 @Raptors This was a totally preventable loss and saying otherwise is total BS. Lowry is the KING but Siakam and Nurse lost the game for us. We are the better team, WITHOUT Siakam on the floor. Let's not sugarcoat.
1304747521806393344 2020-09-12 19:43:44 +0800 <WoodReporting> @JLew1050 Without just two of Pascal's clumsy turnovers that lead to points -- we would have won. Nothing can change that.
1304746771873136641 2020-09-12 19:40:46 +0800 <WoodReporting> @JLew1050 What TF game was he watching? Every fan in the country was yelling for him to get rid of the guy who was losing the game for us.
1304743517961490432 2020-09-12 19:27:50 +0800 <WoodReporting> @ByronYork @FoxNews FFS -- this happened before. Why weren't protocols in place for them to hand them over not wiped? This is obstruction but nothing will happen. Or DOJ is in on it and its all uni-party bullshit.
1304738509232709633 2020-09-12 19:07:56 +0800 <WoodReporting> @Rachel__Nichols Very generous of Kyle. That's why we love him. Pascal, today, not so much.

1304735940426989569 2020-09-12 18:57:43 +0800 <WoodReporting> @axxesa_ Toronto fans are the most diverse in the league. Obs this is the work of nut jobs and not legit fans.  https://t.co/iBxRJ3m3P8
1304734894128599040 2020-09-12 18:53:34 +0800 <WoodReporting> @TSN_Sports He should have been begging for forgiveness. Raps fans are kind. But this clip just makes it worse. Plus I will never view Nick Nurse in the same way. It was his big moment, too and he failed in order to save Pascal's feelings. FFS.
1304634558315474945 2020-09-12 12:14:52 +0800 <WoodReporting> @BlakeMurphyODC @AaronBenRose Correct.

1304631751462072321 2020-09-12 12:03:43 +0800 <WoodReporting> @prizzzkyrizzzky Me neither. Thomas is a solid shooter. When he and Ibaka were on the court, things were better.
1304631576584744961 2020-09-12 12:03:01 +0800 <WoodReporting> @WalderSports I was screaming that at the TV all night.   When? At about 4 minutes into the fourth.   Even I could have coached the team to a win tonight!
1304630993572311042 2020-09-12 12:00:42 +0800 <WoodReporting> @prizzzkyrizzzky Totally winnable.   Minus Siakam's turnovers and the points they lead to, we would have won.   Nurse made a very bad decision tonight.   Don't get his thinking at all.  Fuck...
1304629411715702784 2020-09-12 11:54:25 +0800 <WoodReporting> @prizzzkyrizzzky Pascal lost the game for us.
1304628953978634240 2020-09-12 11:52:36 +0800 <WoodReporting> @SandhuMMA He lost it for us. And so did Nick who should have played Ibaka, instead. WTF was he thinking?

1304511789699342336 2020-09-12 04:07:01 +0800 <WoodReporting> @alexcutler247 This is the right thing to do. This market blunt's a person's instincts + you end up chasing.   Pick a couple of stocks that might give easy wins. Keep cash.  Sometimes there are too many suggestions. I made a stop loss mistake a lost a ton today. My bad but still painful.
1304461851967791115 2020-09-12 00:48:35 +0800 <WoodReporting> @iburs17 @SwipeWright Actually, the documentary would be criticizing Cuties to make the point. Cuties is exploiting and normalizing the sexualization of children. Documentaries would expose and critique exactly that.

This should be a lesson that really good people can innocently screw up and that they shouldn't attacked or cancelled.   Please apply this to everyone.
1304387280317095937 2020-09-11 19:52:16 +0800 <WoodReporting> @AlexBerenson Perfect analogy. Realists must stop fear-mongers in their tracks with this stat. I've tried it and they sort of glaze over like Body Snatchers -- but perhaps it sinks in later.  Yesterday on CBC an "expert" was suggestion we test city  sewage for virus to find outbreaks. FFS.
1304366864047501314 2020-09-11 18:31:09 +0800 <WoodReporting> @jonathanchait No, the song is about blue collar kids being sent "down to war" by the rich - while rich kids were getting college deferments.   Given Trump's stated mission to bring troops home and the liberal neocons commitment to foreign interventions - the lyrics are a Rorschach test.

He had a meeting with Ionnides: remember the "open by Easter moment" but was brow-beaten into following the stupid Imperial College, Fauci, Birx freak out.  Also you might remember a Friday Birx questioned the models. By Tuesday she was being destroyed in the media.

1302210430761304064 2020-09-05 19:42:15 +0800 <WoodReporting> @karol Much better for teenagers to crowd around a gaming console in a small basement than in a larger space where distance can be somewhat controlled + observed.  Total idiots.   Every day I ask myself how these fools get elected+how their public health advisers ever got their degrees.
1302207598427545600 2020-09-05 19:30:59 +0800 <WoodReporting> @JohnJHarwood Just wondering why you are discounting John Bolton who is actally on the record saying it didn't happen and also HATES Trump so has no reason to lie. Why is that evidence ignored? Simple question.
1301938346026045441 2020-09-05 01:41:05 +0800 <WoodReporting> @JordanKarem1 @ScottAdamsSays @POTUS Anyone who believes this misunderstands Trump's essential nature. He want to military academy and given his narcissism, surely relishes being commander in chief. This story doesn't hold up.

1301912037845598210 2020-09-04 23:56:32 +0800 <WoodReporting> @WalderSports I was at that game. With my boys. One of the greatest nights of my life. They were crying with joy and I was so happy to have spent that money. The seats were the price of a small🚗 but worth every penny.
1301909907407597568 2020-09-04 23:48:04 +0800 <WoodReporting> @BobbyFNAxelrod I sold a lot of stuff at a loss just to clean up my account for future bargains. Probably dumb but none of it is making any sense today. Need to reset the brain.
1301870606699421696 2020-09-04 21:11:54 +0800 <WoodReporting> @_rallycap I write for a living and this simple, basketball near-Haiku captures a lot of truth and complexity in few words. Impressive.
1301870190892851200 2020-09-04 21:10:15 +0800 <WoodReporting> @_rallycap That's the tweet. The only one that matters today! Perfect!
1301869464422699008 2020-09-04 21:07:22 +0800 <WoodReporting> @DGreen_14 Miss you up here! I know you cheer for your friends in TO and the Raps to win this -- if you guys are out, of course.
1301868719648407552 2020-09-04 21:04:24 +0800 <WoodReporting> @KendrickPerkins Yes yes yes. Kyle is the King. Deferred to KL last year. This year he is stepping out. Don't forget OG -- ice-water man in pink kicks!
1301867716945604608 2020-09-04 21:00:25 +0800 <WoodReporting> @StockLizardKing Oh, and my man OG hit the buzzer beater. Take that Kawhi. We good. 🏀
1301867267219652608 2020-09-04 20:58:38 +0800 <WoodReporting> @StockLizardKing Weirdly OK. Went through the five stages of grief last night but woke up oddly optimistic. Buying ops and delusional refusal to step back......
1301865481931022338 2020-09-04 20:51:33 +0800 <WoodReporting> @BobbyFNAxelrod Not possible for me. I switched from small bios to tech two days ago. Bought on big dips but phew....not good. Learning and working it out.
1301854182824128512 2020-09-04 20:06:39 +0800 <WoodReporting> @MarcLobliner Well, if there were a thousand protests and 10 percent were violent that means there were a hundred violent protests. This is a gaslighting analysis.
1301837633652428800 2020-09-04 19:00:53 +0800 <WoodReporting> @jonkay @kshahrooz FFS. Where is this coming from? Did anyone talk to parents?
1301835514560024576 2020-09-04 18:52:28 +0800 <WoodReporting> @anish_koka @alexberenson  Bombshell reporting:  Covid death rates dropped as doctors rejected ventilators   Doctors in NYC warned us. Overuse was policy because medical staff felt better protected if COVID patients were unconscious.    Paywall sorry.   https://t.co/fZYclEFSwC
1301833113291624449 2020-09-04 18:42:55 +0800 <WoodReporting> @RealJamesWoods @monkeyglasses11 The war ruined my father. He was bitter, angry and alcoholic. Also wouldn't say a word about his service in the Navy. My mother told me he witnessed the sinking of a sister ship. Screaming men in the water, floating and burned by engine oil aflame on the high seas.
1301687489309093889 2020-09-04 09:04:16 +0800 <WoodReporting> @jonkay @nytimes Desperate nonsense.
1301642589087690753 2020-09-04 06:05:51 +0800 <WoodReporting> @hollandcourtney @VICENews Not up to them to call the cops but they do have a confession the cops will be interested in seeing. That's how its done.
1301478879861800960 2020-09-03 19:15:19 +0800 <WoodReporting> @gools2_gooley Aging women are the last acceptable of recipients prejudice and cruelty. It is shockingly obvious.
1301466172550938625 2020-09-03 18:24:50 +0800 <WoodReporting> @iamjohn_c Does Trumps's announcement of a vaccine in November make IBIO worth another look given its reproductive potential?
1301458447339319297 2020-09-03 17:54:08 +0800 <WoodReporting> @JayWake4 @ClayTravis That's not the point. Women idolizing a man wanted for sexual assault is wrong.
1301303577525317632 2020-09-03 07:38:44 +0800 <WoodReporting> @Timcast I was reading a coroner's review of excited delirium and also remember one of the cops involved saying it looked ED and asking what to do.  My fear is that Chauvin has been overcharged and they won't get a conviction. You are correct that the country will burn.
1301302781177925635 2020-09-03 07:35:34 +0800 <WoodReporting> @iamjohn_c Don't worry about the SNSS story. If it was all predictable you would be in Barbados already....:)

1300946346434854913 2020-09-02 07:59:14 +0800 <WoodReporting> @iamjohn_c NAK is making money for me. Phew! I thought it was toast.
