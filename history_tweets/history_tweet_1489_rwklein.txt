1343268726599258118 2020-12-28 02:53:15 +0800 <rwklein> @realDonaldTrump You are the ugliest chapter in our nation's history.

1342922915600355328 2020-12-27 03:59:08 +0800 <rwklein> @realDonaldTrump You have been the biggest scam in our nation's history. The Senate should have convicted you after the House impeached you. Still, the people spoke on Nov. 3 and you were fired. Good riddance!
1342584642642337793 2020-12-26 05:34:57 +0800 <rwklein> @realDonaldTrump Are we supposed to believe that you care more about Americans than yourself?

1342292036037185537 2020-12-25 10:12:14 +0800 <rwklein> @realDonaldTrump Thank God you will be leaving office soon. I will take my chances with the Democrats and Republicans who stand up to you versus the lunacy and idiocy we have had to endure the last 4 years.
1341822471306096642 2020-12-24 03:06:21 +0800 <rwklein> @AP So much for "draining the swamp."
1341820290393882631 2020-12-24 02:57:41 +0800 <rwklein> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA How are those lawsuits working for you, Mr. President? I think you are batting 1 for 60 - not a good average.
1341794539154116609 2020-12-24 01:15:22 +0800 <rwklein> @MatthewJshow @realDonaldTrump That's funny. Maybe 4 more years in prison.
1341794321889112064 2020-12-24 01:14:30 +0800 <rwklein> @realjunsonchan @realDonaldTrump The "pork" is in the omnibus spending bill attached to the Covid19 relief bill. Pork is how shit gets passed in the Congress. Show me a spending bill that has never contained pork. This is a stunt by Trump to gin up support for him.
1341792861847756800 2020-12-24 01:08:42 +0800 <rwklein> @realDonaldTrump You are a disgrace and an embarrassment to our country. If you are not willing to help, please get out of the way so that sane adults can get things done.
1340786248798093313 2020-12-21 06:28:46 +0800 <rwklein> @KLoeffler @NikkiHaley Is the KKK one of the sponsors of this tour?
1340715535244386307 2020-12-21 01:47:47 +0800 <rwklein> @realDonaldTrump You are the greatest fraud in the history of our country.
1340699601213513728 2020-12-21 00:44:28 +0800 <rwklein> @kayleighmcenany She was just expressing what many Americans feel, Kayleigh. As you continue to lie for your boss, how does it feel to be rotting from the inside out?
1340107088559783936 2020-12-19 09:30:02 +0800 <rwklein> @realDonaldTrump I beg to differ Mr. President, but that is exactly what Democrats did in 2016.
1337898626891337729 2020-12-13 07:14:24 +0800 <rwklein> @KenPaxtonTX You dug your own grave with your absurd and offensive lawsuit. Just surrender yourself to federal authorities and get on with your life in prison.
1337740230409981954 2020-12-12 20:44:59 +0800 <rwklein> @realDonaldTrump The Supreme Court ruled correctly. Texas has no standing to overturn the will of the voters in other states and that will was to fire you. You were fired for reasons that are obvious to the majority of Americans. Your claims of fraud are unfounded and self-serving.
1337048025592705025 2020-12-10 22:54:25 +0800 <rwklein> @IngrahamAngle Seriously, Laura. There were more than 3,000 deaths yesterday from Covid-19, and this is what you tweet?
1336716585671798787 2020-12-10 00:57:23 +0800 <rwklein> @kayleighmcenany @Perduesenate We don't need another Russian-controlled "president" like Trump.
1331608913884672004 2020-11-25 22:41:19 +0800 <rwklein> @kayleighmcenany Better than the lunatic and idiotic rantings of your boss.
1325070906251677697 2020-11-07 21:41:37 +0800 <rwklein> @realDonaldTrump Where is your proof of this?
1325070696456785920 2020-11-07 21:40:47 +0800 <rwklein> @realDonaldTrump Not miraculous. You discouraged your supporters from voting by mail so no big surprise that when they began counting the absentee ballots, your leads disappeared. No evidence of any fraud.
1311335445511503873 2020-10-01 00:01:48 +0800 <rwklein> @KellyannePolls Your master is the liar and someone who thinks it is OK to assault women. America saw the real Donald Trump last night.
