They are fear based.  The laws of nature cannot be repealed.  Bitcoin is in alignment with those laws. The Fed/Gov't are not.
1336839682441830405 2020-12-10 09:06:32 +0800 <ScottByrd> @S_Mikhailovich Also, there is an enormous amount of innovation happening on the edge of the network around payments, etc.  Will all of this go down in flames and innovation will be squelched?

1336714973502902273 2020-12-10 00:50:59 +0800 <ScottByrd> @_RJTodd The giveaway on this deal is the 75bps rate.  The convertible arb guys won't be interested so big shorting in the common won't happen.  This is clearly a common stock proxy for hedge funds.  No current dilution.  It's a brilliant strategy, imo.
1336714005101080578 2020-12-10 00:47:08 +0800 <ScottByrd> @_RJTodd My bet is Bridgewater.
1336671364271497218 2020-12-09 21:57:42 +0800 <ScottByrd> @nic__carter @TheBlock__ Increased the size due to demand. Also, there is an option to issue another $100 million which I am sure will be slurped up.
1336663489306308608 2020-12-09 21:26:24 +0800 <ScottByrd> @PrestonPysh This .75 rate takes out a lot of the attractiveness of the convertible arbitrage trade.  He spoke about getting destroyed earlier in his career by hedgie shorting his common into oblivion.  Not gonna happen this time.  Brilliant.
1336659182712401921 2020-12-09 21:09:17 +0800 <ScottByrd> @michael_saylor Also, the upsizing of the offering speak to "reverse inquiry."  This feels like hedgies/family offices coming to him to get exposure without him doing a dilutive common stock offering.  Unprecedented move.
1336658670420172802 2020-12-09 21:07:15 +0800 <ScottByrd> @michael_saylor This is brilliant.  Pricing this at at .75 yield makes a convertible arbitrage trade unattractive.  He has had experience with issuing a convert and having his common shorted to nothing.  This won't happen now.  The common should be bought.

She expects us to believe she isn't looking seriously at something that has this type of assymetrical upside given the return obstacles she faces?  It would be outright malpractice of her not to look seriously.
1336330777651339275 2020-12-08 23:24:19 +0800 <ScottByrd> @jeffreyatucker You are feeling Bitcoin's side effects.  It does it without you even being conscious of it.  Bitcoin is hope.

If they say they are serious then every other pension fund in the world gets serious and ANY edge they have is gone from a price perspective.  Game theory.
1336306483701682176 2020-12-08 21:47:47 +0800 <ScottByrd> @GoingParabolic @andrewrsorkin Absolutely.  She used vague terms like "not seriously looking..."  If she said they were serious it would dramatically effect the price.
1336305263968739328 2020-12-08 21:42:56 +0800 <ScottByrd> @GoingParabolic @andrewrsorkin This is misdirection.

1334266940827820032 2020-12-03 06:43:22 +0800 <ScottByrd> Hey  @AmericanExpress  I am on two waiting lists to get a credit card that gives me Bitcoin as the reward and I plan on moving my $15-50K/mo charges to them if you guys don't follow suit.  Anything in the works?
1334260151881244677 2020-12-03 06:16:24 +0800 <ScottByrd> @wlrvs I cannot wait for this.  This changes everything.

1333950565722828801 2020-12-02 09:46:13 +0800 <ScottByrd> @PeterSchiff Why not just say this asset is not for me and move on?  What is with this obsession for tearing down this asset that has outperformed EVERYTHING for the last decade?  You are a supposedly a mature adult...where is the self awareness? Childish

Fear will keep most away.  I don't live my life that way.  I position size correctly and commit to defending this beautiful idea.  Thanks for the chat!
1332718836190208000 2020-11-29 00:11:45 +0800 <ScottByrd> @daretocontraire @michael_saylor Got it.  Well, I see it a bit differently.  To me, the obvious threat (govts and all other FUD) is priced in now.  Otherwise, we would be bigly higher than we are now.  Paypal/Square has done the work for you around the gov't stuff.  All the best!
1332715395296452616 2020-11-28 23:58:05 +0800 <ScottByrd> @daretocontraire @michael_saylor Possibly.  But, it might make sense to have a small exposure in case you are wrong, eh?  Cheers!

1328826589300355072 2020-11-18 06:25:21 +0800 <ScottByrd> @PrestonPysh @LukeGromen Be interesting to hear you guys talk about the impact of bitcoin on the fee based RIA community.  It could be the biggest boon for asset gatherers in the history of the world.
1328826016433893379 2020-11-18 06:23:05 +0800 <ScottByrd> @Gemini @cameron @tyler @exame If advisors who are paid a set fee from assets under management and are not allocating to bitcoin...they are insane.  This could be the biggest boon to the RIA industry ever!

1328485245381976065 2020-11-17 07:48:59 +0800 <ScottByrd> @GoingParabolic @ehandschuh Hands down more fun.

1327008723362050049 2020-11-13 06:01:48 +0800 <ScottByrd> @Breedlove22 Hey @Breedlove22 when is the Saylor series out?  Today?  :)

1326616327910461441 2020-11-12 04:02:34 +0800 <ScottByrd> Irrefutable piece, IMO.  Amazing work @parkeralewis
1326610067236515841 2020-11-12 03:37:41 +0800 <ScottByrd> @BarrySilbert Checkmate.
1326546894084997124 2020-11-11 23:26:40 +0800 <ScottByrd> @DaveSpiwak @maxkeiser @RayDalio Speculating, of course. And, the amount BW would have to buy to make a difference is massive so needs the price to stay around here for a while.  Plus, just watch his interviews.  His micro expressions and insanely thin arguments show his cards, to me.  This is my line of work.
1326545916241702913 2020-11-11 23:22:47 +0800 <ScottByrd> @maxkeiser @RayDalio He's already buying.

1326254054851436545 2020-11-11 04:03:01 +0800 <ScottByrd> Possibly one of the most important people in all of government currently.
1326253799841943554 2020-11-11 04:02:01 +0800 <ScottByrd> @CynthiaMLummis This is amazing.  Congratulations @CynthiaMLummis Thank you for being an advocate for all that is possible with Bitcoin.
1326207178844278784 2020-11-11 00:56:45 +0800 <ScottByrd> @maxkeiser @RayDalio His arguments against BTC are so thin it's laughable.  He must be accumulating.  Impossible to believe someone so "open minded" does not see the truths prrsented.
1326203518630375424 2020-11-11 00:42:13 +0800 <ScottByrd> More important context from two high profile investors...

1304403308577206274 2020-09-11 20:55:58 +0800 <ScottByrd> @beeforbacon1 This is truth.  Who is the ‚ÄúI‚Äù that could own anything? Bitcoin points directly to this truth. And what could be more valuable than that?
