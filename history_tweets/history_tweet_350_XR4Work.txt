1343889809664847872 2020-12-29 20:01:13 +0800 <XR4Work> @blackgirlgamers Medal of Honor VR. Determined to not get distracted by other titles in my library and finish this one!
1343831004633571333 2020-12-29 16:07:33 +0800 <XR4Work> @3Dorganon is an industry leading 3D, AR and VR anatomy app. Check out our overview over at the VR 4 Work YouTube page  https://t.co/a95d290KfY
1343754802665316353 2020-12-29 11:04:45 +0800 <XR4Work> Wow, that's a lot of green!
1343752980923871232 2020-12-29 10:57:31 +0800 <XR4Work> @GenericBologna There hasn't been any good music in the last 20 years.
1343752717450272768 2020-12-29 10:56:28 +0800 <XR4Work> Yeah it's was HTC's market to lose and they did. Cosmos and Focus + did not impress. I'm certainly hopeful but they have a lot of ground to make up.
1343728880029458435 2020-12-29 09:21:44 +0800 <XR4Work> @bmfshow Hey Matt @AcadicusX seems like a possible solution. Jon @acadicus maybe you could review Matt's idea and see if your platform might accommodate his idea?
1343716599623262209 2020-12-29 08:32:57 +0800 <XR4Work> Glad I read this. I've gotten side tracked by holiday titles and need to finish MOH before moving to other things.
1343571579926683648 2020-12-28 22:56:41 +0800 <XR4Work> #VR is also for serious stuff, #Anatomy, #AEC, #programming, #geography, #Productivity, #healthcare, #mindmapping, #meetings, #teambuilding and more. Come join us in the metaverse at VR 4 Work  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl and over on Facebook  https://t.co/7K0c8aGi43
1343521175285202946 2020-12-28 19:36:24 +0800 <XR4Work> You still got it.
1343351500270088192 2020-12-28 08:22:10 +0800 <XR4Work> @Fierce_JPierce @VrRetweeter @zacbrownband What!? I love @zacbrownband ! Where, @oculus_venues?
1343308733326225409 2020-12-28 05:32:14 +0800 <XR4Work> When playing @proputtvr solo I like to listen at an audio book while I make my way around the course. If I get stuck in the simulation while listening to @READYPLAYER2 I think I could be content for quite a while! 😆
1343259051342389251 2020-12-28 02:14:49 +0800 <XR4Work> Yeah I literally just turned 59 yesterday and I cant see it happen fast enough. Worried I may miss something if it takes too long. But plenty keeping me busy now.
1343258622378307584 2020-12-28 02:13:06 +0800 <XR4Work> @bccasteel I bet you already have some encyclopedic knowledge of this individual?
1343258418958786565 2020-12-28 02:12:18 +0800 <XR4Work> Ok got #Ragnarok by @WanadevStudio loaded up and I'm going in to practice. Got to get ready in case i ever run into @AtomBombBody out there!
1343257180074635264 2020-12-28 02:07:22 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey man I'm having fun. This is genuinely exciting to me. It's like seeing science fiction come to life and I get to experience it! We live in exciting times.
1343255797585817600 2020-12-28 02:01:53 +0800 <XR4Work> Want to know what else you can do in #VR  besides games? Check out VR4Work on Facebook and YouTube to see what's possible for productivity and business in a @oculus @htcvive @WindowsMixedR or other HMD.  https://t.co/ZhtiJ52zke  @MeetinVR
1343251305146560512 2020-12-28 01:44:02 +0800 <XR4Work> New video up on the YouTube site. We look at @MeetinVR. Outstanding Meet&amp;Collab platform. Hope you check it out and share it with others! Lets get the word out that VR is more than games. Its also the best platform for getting work done!  https://t.co/ZhtiJ52zke
1343250532069203972 2020-12-28 01:40:57 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey Ryan, hope you will keep me in the loop as you progress this! Would love to help share the news and be a part of what you're making. Right up my alley, or fairway as that may be!
1343227129274765323 2020-12-28 00:07:58 +0800 <XR4Work> @RealVRFishing is a great one. Would like to have one big boat all participants could be on! @MarkChoi_MIRAGE
1343213475397558272 2020-12-27 23:13:42 +0800 <XR4Work> VR 4 work is evolving in 2021...  https://t.co/x9UBEQVbYj
1343211693766275077 2020-12-27 23:06:38 +0800 <XR4Work> So thinking today about VR as a team building tool. Experiences like @proputtvr can be so much more than just a game. What other titles would you put in the category of potential team development platforms?
1343168682332192768 2020-12-27 20:15:43 +0800 <XR4Work> @OneMangryGamer We are our here brother! Trying to show these kids VR ain't just for gamin over at VR 4 Work  https://t.co/4xQ28IiwvU
1343161093758320641 2020-12-27 19:45:34 +0800 <XR4Work> Gee Mike, I feel like a poorly kept secret.
1343160502562775040 2020-12-27 19:43:13 +0800 <XR4Work> Yep, so much more. If only they're were someone who focused on this VR 4 Work concept. 🤔😆
1342809189446516736 2020-12-26 20:27:13 +0800 <XR4Work> New update from @EnpassApp password manager is outstanding! Checks and alerts you to any possibly exposed passwords on launch. I'm looking pretty good but Think I'll update many of my codes for 2021. Your online more than ever so get a good PW manager like Enpass!
1342794235502800899 2020-12-26 19:27:48 +0800 <XR4Work> @playz_vr Is throw out Death Horizon also.
1342434223114907650 2020-12-25 19:37:14 +0800 <XR4Work> @bccasteel @Justin_Moving
1342431977778126848 2020-12-25 19:28:19 +0800 <XR4Work> So Santa is an rts guy? 🤔
1342239910279962627 2020-12-25 06:45:06 +0800 <XR4Work> @Rengle820 Getting this for several friends tomorrow so we can play. Glad there is a sale!
1342239425737195520 2020-12-25 06:43:11 +0800 <XR4Work> @One_Hamsa @SideQuestVR One of the must have titles on the Quest! I come back to it me and again.
1341469633682026501 2020-12-23 03:44:18 +0800 <XR4Work> Lets hope @Viveport is listening!
1341376861050433539 2020-12-22 21:35:39 +0800 <XR4Work> Agree. Cant think of a much faster response to the community then ive seen here. Im having a blast with it. Just destroyed Big Gerta and looking forward to whats next.
1341348712547803136 2020-12-22 19:43:48 +0800 <XR4Work> @dr_oculus @Viveport I enjoy that they have lots of titles I'd never have picked up without having the sub.
1341346249287610368 2020-12-22 19:34:01 +0800 <XR4Work> Enjoy seeing VR related articles in major publications. We find using a device management app like @grove_xr necessary to manage the users experience.
1341344699387420672 2020-12-22 19:27:51 +0800 <XR4Work> Can't wait to try this. Got numerous projects loaded up and a team eager to try this. Who sits at home on their #Quest2 loading up construction files? Me! 😆
1341343435492642823 2020-12-22 19:22:50 +0800 <XR4Work> @Chilli_anime  https://t.co/hQUs9R2tyz
1340989742981136384 2020-12-21 19:57:23 +0800 <XR4Work> Good morning @Limitless_VR_! Have grown to look for and appreciate these messages. Even started cashing my morning coffee my cuppa! Merry Christmas week!
1340034760635281410 2020-12-19 04:42:38 +0800 <XR4Work> I don't know Roblox except as a game my grandkids play. Anyone want to expound on the purchase of @loom_ai by @Roblox recently. Wondering about the business case for this.
1340005286380269570 2020-12-19 02:45:31 +0800 <XR4Work> Great tips!

1339945236341133312 2020-12-18 22:46:53 +0800 <XR4Work> @bccasteel miss you and the family son!
1339941881443192834 2020-12-18 22:33:34 +0800 <XR4Work> Wow very powerful. Would be eager to see some subjective reports and objective data from this effort.
1339904564976377856 2020-12-18 20:05:17 +0800 <XR4Work> @bmfshow Given when he sent this, Maybe he got caught up playing the new Jurassic Park and then just saw the time?

1339733721621139459 2020-12-18 08:46:24 +0800 <XR4Work> @WorldTaiChiDay @Justin_Moving They're is a Tai Chi daily? Who knew?

1339716048602411009 2020-12-18 07:36:11 +0800 <XR4Work> @CharlieFink @proputtvr @Topgolf @Rengle820 @CathyHackl @PfluegerJan @VirtualTedS @SophiaMosh Same here. Hope we get to play a round sometime.
1339653317794926593 2020-12-18 03:26:55 +0800 <XR4Work> Hitting the holiday party over @Virbela1 and @eventfarm later today.  https://t.co/foZbQ2CsEm Hope to see some of you virtual people around there later!  https://t.co/ZNTlknDGTy
1339352307432079362 2020-12-17 07:30:48 +0800 <XR4Work> Ok not impressed with the #ReverbG2. My next target @pimaxofficial give me that sweet FOV. got to start saving the pennies...
1339347572633329669 2020-12-17 07:11:59 +0800 <XR4Work>  https://t.co/I8Oip777bd
1339347235163820034 2020-12-17 07:10:39 +0800 <XR4Work> Man trying to play @medalofhonor with a #ReverbG2 and the controller tracking is really bad. Really find this unfortunate as I was hoping this would be a bright spot for vr. Just not for gaming.
1339184740969099265 2020-12-16 20:24:57 +0800 <XR4Work> @spatialxr @CharlieFink @Forbes @Android Ok found it in the experimental section.
1339000510494412800 2020-12-16 08:12:53 +0800 <XR4Work> @TheRainbowGame3 @WanadevStudio That's insane! I'll stick to Drunken Dwarves.
1338997184856006661 2020-12-16 07:59:40 +0800 <XR4Work> @spatialxr @CharlieFink @Forbes Got @Android ?
1338996083192705024 2020-12-16 07:55:18 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy This a new one?
1338818865107791872 2020-12-15 20:11:06 +0800 <XR4Work> @tomwarren Nice. I use both so big win here!
1338816682240958465 2020-12-15 20:02:25 +0800 <XR4Work> Great news!
1338809265818116097 2020-12-15 19:32:57 +0800 <XR4Work> @IrenaCronin @InfiniteRetina We are at that stage of the industry where there will be lots of buy outs, consolidations and closings as experiments are tried and failed and companies work to figure out where XR fits. Hopefully some will see is not a fit but a paradigm change is needed for it to succeed.
1338630707481088002 2020-12-15 07:43:25 +0800 <XR4Work> @dr_oculus @Viveport What happened to your @Viveport ?
1338520588944596993 2020-12-15 00:25:51 +0800 <XR4Work> @kentbye @EducatorsVR @PlutoVR @JaredMonkey @forestgibson  https://t.co/z6ARjGqewK
1338508264305254400 2020-12-14 23:36:53 +0800 <XR4Work> @ID_AA_Carmack Waiting for the VR based remake!
1338508033790537729 2020-12-14 23:35:58 +0800 <XR4Work> Looking forward to this addition to an already great platform! If you don't have a password manager ok here now!
1338468875084722179 2020-12-14 21:00:22 +0800 <XR4Work> Stop over at the VR 4 Work YouTube site and check out our trio of #VRAnatomy overviews. Learn about @3Dorganon #AnatomyExplorer2020 and @SharecareInc and maybe set a goal for 2021 to learn more about your body and your health.  https://t.co/4xQ28IiwvU #Anatomy #medicalvr
1337952575468036096 2020-12-13 10:48:46 +0800 <XR4Work> @nyborhtims @deathhorizonvr Great game. My fav zombie shooter on quest. Turn the music off and go just with ambient sounds. So creepy!
1337817923235278848 2020-12-13 01:53:43 +0800 <XR4Work> We are planning a group tour of @MeetinVR on the 18th and 20th. Check out Facebook page for details and to sign up  https://t.co/GJ06mlEx1P
1337731185108262913 2020-12-12 20:09:03 +0800 <XR4Work> @AtomBombBody @WanadevStudio  https://t.co/hckb6m4sdB
1337730246649458692 2020-12-12 20:05:19 +0800 <XR4Work> @amandablain Android user here still lamenting the passing of Windows phone. 😔
1337542545841197064 2020-12-12 07:39:27 +0800 <XR4Work> @AtomBombBody @WanadevStudio Been playing around with this since the beta launched. This is my kind of rythym game. I got dibs on a match also!
1337540645691531265 2020-12-12 07:31:54 +0800 <XR4Work> Wow that is a handy skill.
1337417859958534144 2020-12-11 23:24:00 +0800 <XR4Work> OK So I'm an hour in to @medalofhonor Above and Beyond and loving it. Playing on a laptop with a 2070 super and gameplay and graphics are great. Captures the early MOH feel precisely. I'm a fan and this takes you into that world. Can't wait for more.
1337377800970526720 2020-12-11 20:44:49 +0800 <XR4Work> @RJdoesVR I agree. Tired of articles and headlines placing VR as a stepchild to AR which is seen as the "real" goal for immersive tech. I'm not convinced AR will be a thing any time soon. It's very expensive and technically not entirely figured out yet. VR is here and now!
1337374236286050311 2020-12-11 20:30:39 +0800 <XR4Work> @gabrielwebbxr @proputtvr Great to hear. First time I played in the beta I had that thought. It would be nice to have a few meeting tools maybe a whiteboard and voice notes but the envornment is ideal for team bonding and discussion.
1337373516224737283 2020-12-11 20:27:48 +0800 <XR4Work> @AlexisRodney Welcome to the cult!  https://t.co/usz6smcb4S
1337168279882829825 2020-12-11 06:52:15 +0800 <XR4Work> @JoshuaCorvinus I've always felt this was something that demo'd better than the reality of its use.
1337166274091212801 2020-12-11 06:44:17 +0800 <XR4Work> 2 hours to @medalofhonor time. Then the download...  https://t.co/l1s2AWDDXG
1337098739337596932 2020-12-11 02:15:56 +0800 <XR4Work> @playz_vr For us lazy folks drop us a link to your channel.
1337046960029786122 2020-12-10 22:50:11 +0800 <XR4Work> You know your head is stuck in the VR metaverse when you click a tweet that promises to show how to do a proper "plank" expecting to see some @richiesplank but its an exercise channel!😧
1337036015962185730 2020-12-10 22:06:41 +0800 <XR4Work> @MeetinVR is such an exciting VR Meet and Collab platform. We are scheduling at tour on Dec 18th and another the 20th. If you'd like to know more and join us visit our VR 4 Work page  https://t.co/zGTSVmEefp

1336737435561193474 2020-12-10 02:20:14 +0800 <XR4Work> @purplemikey You try it yet? I'm tapped for the year. Up to my eye balls in anatomy apps at present and picked up Lone Echo, Stormland, Brass Tactics and Asgards Wrath AND have MOH on Friday. No.... More.... Room!
1336665819141562373 2020-12-09 21:35:39 +0800 <XR4Work> A new release on a Wednesday? Typically  these occur Thursday. Maybe some buffer in advance of MOH?
1336653716393504769 2020-12-09 20:47:34 +0800 <XR4Work> 2nd in my series on VR #Anatomy apps. We look at Anatomy Explorer 2020. A $29.99 title in the Rift store with a great set of content and tools for those willing and able to explore and figure out the capabilities on thier own.  https://t.co/ZGj78cKFm0
1336644088158892035 2020-12-09 20:09:18 +0800 <XR4Work> I feel like they're are lots of killer none game use cases or there and I talk about them over at VR 4 Work  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl
1336642166383382528 2020-12-09 20:01:40 +0800 <XR4Work> This is THE Anatomy learning platform for group learning, classes, and study. check out our overview of the platform at VR 4 Work  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl
1336641098509381632 2020-12-09 19:57:26 +0800 <XR4Work> @Limitless_VR_ Good morning just now 6:55am here on the east coast in the states. Working on more vr anatomy app coverage today. VR can gamify even serious material can't it? Well it's certainly the best learning platform ever!  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl
1336638216619896832 2020-12-09 19:45:59 +0800 <XR4Work> @playz_vr Oh yeah because when your being chased by mutant creatures and zombies your thought is hey, let's go check out this dark salt mine! 🤔😆
1336451443461656576 2020-12-09 07:23:48 +0800 <XR4Work> Hope many of you take the time to read this and check out the book. If you see VR as anything more than casual entertainment you would really benefit seeing the real world impact down in VRX.
1336449037667454976 2020-12-09 07:14:15 +0800 <XR4Work> I do love that innovative 2nd screen. Very cool. If I hadn't just got a new @msigaming laptop (that I'm very happy with) I'd be shopping this.
1336448245023858689 2020-12-09 07:11:06 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey I'd just like to see the Doom VR project finally release.

1336400520202874882 2020-12-09 04:01:27 +0800 <XR4Work> Very intriguing. You should do a video on this. I'd watch it!

1336280114905161728 2020-12-08 20:03:00 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey @SharecareInc want to add you to my series on #Anatomy apps in vr. how about an answer to my several correspondence? Hello?
1336278511678607360 2020-12-08 19:56:38 +0800 <XR4Work> Great game. Supported it on Kickstarter when they went that route. Played the first demo months ago. Eager to see how far they have come since.
1336119803107553281 2020-12-08 09:25:59 +0800 <XR4Work> Looking forward to it!
1336117856900173825 2020-12-08 09:18:15 +0800 <XR4Work> @UploadVR I've played every pc hard MOH and was very surprised and excited to see it come to VR and will be playing day 1. I hear the concerns regarding specs but hope it puts these to rest and the focus will be on its gameplay and advancing VR.
1336114897218916354 2020-12-08 09:06:29 +0800 <XR4Work> Doing a series on #Anatomy over at  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl First off is @3Dorganon a expansive, scalable teaching platform for a class or an individual with 1000s of models and tools for learning anatomy.
1336110955130916866 2020-12-08 08:50:50 +0800 <XR4Work> @dr_oculus @Viveport Though it's not a game take a look at @Noda_Tech . I came across it on Viveport over a year ago and have found it a really meditative yet productive tool for planning and organizing one's thoughts. It just came out of beta on Steam and a @oculus release is pending early 21
1336032831307460612 2020-12-08 03:40:23 +0800 <XR4Work> Id love to see more. Are there any videos of this in action?
1335996288442249218 2020-12-08 01:15:11 +0800 <XR4Work> As a Kickstarter backer this is Great news! Any purchase option yet or just beta for now?
1335993756122836992 2020-12-08 01:05:07 +0800 <XR4Work> New vid posted over on YouTube.  This time we look at a Training and Education platform for #Anatomy, @3Dorganon. With 1000's of images, a powerful set of tools and the ability to hold multi-user sessions, its great for teachers and students alike!  https://t.co/a95d290KfY
1335967531249643520 2020-12-07 23:20:55 +0800 <XR4Work> Brilliant!
1335931574425186304 2020-12-07 20:58:02 +0800 <XR4Work> @Your_Pal_in_VR #medalofhonor at least that's the way I'm going.
1335928948459532288 2020-12-07 20:47:36 +0800 <XR4Work> @SweViver @pimaxofficial So @pimaxofficial is bringing its own virtual office capibility into its headsets? This is very cool. I've watched them for years as the only consumer brand to offer a true wide FOV as a feature set. Have to start saving the pennies I guess!
1335927691514667009 2020-12-07 20:42:36 +0800 <XR4Work> @msitarzewski I don't know. I've been spending a lot of my time tethering my #quest2 lately. I use virtual desktop regularly but the cable does provide a better experience. Well except for the cable part.
1335926224749801473 2020-12-07 20:36:46 +0800 <XR4Work> Check out @grove_xr which is free for up to 3 devices and works remote. Perfect tool for this need.
1335924915942383618 2020-12-07 20:31:34 +0800 <XR4Work> @bmfshow VR gaming certainly gets all my gaming time now but I see so much more potential. The ability to work daily in apps like @ImmersedVR, training and education in @vreducation /Engage and have meetings in platforms like @MeetinVR is what really holds my interest.
1335922588778983425 2020-12-07 20:22:20 +0800 <XR4Work> I'm reviewing anatomy apps this month. Got any ideas for a Christmas theme with body parts? 🤔🎄🎁🎅♥️
1335681680573599746 2020-12-07 04:25:03 +0800 <XR4Work> Yeah I don't mean to speak negativity of them. I've been looking at them for a year but just keep hearing very mixed reviews. Enough it's held me off. @pimaxofficial I'm happy to test one and report on my findings!
1335667454727565315 2020-12-07 03:28:31 +0800 <XR4Work> Couldn't agree more. Please don't make me buy a Pimax next year. I'll do it if I have to but hope for other options.
1335666691666300936 2020-12-07 03:25:29 +0800 <XR4Work> @purplemikey @Tsukinune @medalofhonor Ok specs aside as I plan to get it, oculus or Steam? I'm leaning oculus as I'm playing on a quest 2 with link.
1335664169518063622 2020-12-07 03:15:28 +0800 <XR4Work> Ohhhh is like an advent calendar teaser...
1335663647855611905 2020-12-07 03:13:23 +0800 <XR4Work> @theextendedmind Issue with One game, while frustrating shouldn't be used when we have countless users, including me, playing this way daily.
1335662490168987652 2020-12-07 03:08:47 +0800 <XR4Work> peanut butter is the near perfect food.
1335662260719661057 2020-12-07 03:07:53 +0800 <XR4Work> @DavidWHilton @waywardstrategy Yeah mine also. You an old guy like me?
1335562324254535681 2020-12-06 20:30:46 +0800 <XR4Work> Great article. I'm reading #VRX by @BrennanSpiegel now and just went over a section he did which covers the medical science on children and VR. Like work TV and 2d games adults must research, be aware of sensitivities monitor and help put in context for kids
1335344945222266882 2020-12-06 06:06:59 +0800 <XR4Work> @shanselman Yep got one for Christmas in 19xx
1335321636006924288 2020-12-06 04:34:21 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy @Justin_Moving this was part of the story I never told you as kids...
1335317807039459330 2020-12-06 04:19:08 +0800 <XR4Work> So @medalofhonor launching in less than a week. If your on a #Quest2 you planning to buy Oculus or Steam?
1335241672968515590 2020-12-05 23:16:37 +0800 <XR4Work> @GAMERTAGVR @medalofhonor Guess I'm going to need to delete Asgards Wrath now
1335034065808920577 2020-12-05 09:31:39 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey thanks for responding. Don't hesitate to hit me up if a bunch fall through. I'll be getting my practice in the meantime.
1335029071537983498 2020-12-05 09:11:48 +0800 <XR4Work> @Zimtok5 @RtoVR I'm in if there is a spot!
1335024578226229250 2020-12-05 08:53:57 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy 1. Lone Echo 2. Rinlo 3. Wrest 4. Top Golf 5. Racket NX I'm all #VR at this point. Medal of Honor VR comes out next week and I'll be all over that.
1335021374327414785 2020-12-05 08:41:13 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy Or when your son has 2000 more Twitter followers then you do!
1335020563547435021 2020-12-05 08:38:00 +0800 <XR4Work> @OneMangryGamer Best to be sure. Hoping you get an all clear.
1334836349833277441 2020-12-04 20:26:00 +0800 <XR4Work> @Anticleric This is what I think is at play when people ask why Microsoft and Apple haven't jumped in. If they can't dominate and the number isn't billions they aren't going there.
1334835334769684482 2020-12-04 20:21:58 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey get off my lawn/course! 😉😆  https://t.co/wkhLPqd7VQ
1334834693867495424 2020-12-04 20:19:25 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy this is me youtubing 😆
1334617719241629697 2020-12-04 05:57:14 +0800 <XR4Work> So does this take place in @mootup3d?
1334601984926683136 2020-12-04 04:54:43 +0800 <XR4Work> Tonight's viewing list...
1334556963057913857 2020-12-04 01:55:49 +0800 <XR4Work> On my reading list!
1334553982572834818 2020-12-04 01:43:58 +0800 <XR4Work> So I had to do my Cyberpunk #avatar over at  https://t.co/jm1xs3s563 @getwolf3d Much easier to accommodate the future headgear when your bald!  https://t.co/B8bCJw2HCQ
1334549238567624706 2020-12-04 01:25:07 +0800 <XR4Work> Seeing @grove_xr is now compatible with @oculus #Quest2 and can do remote support as well. If you have more than 1 Quest you should check this out! See our video on Grove on our YouTube site  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl
1334539538841169924 2020-12-04 00:46:35 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy @Justin_Moving
1334510743404879878 2020-12-03 22:52:09 +0800 <XR4Work> So you need MORE @PistolWhipVR !
1334510648680714242 2020-12-03 22:51:47 +0800 <XR4Work> Thanks very much! Will check outy today.
1334499751534997512 2020-12-03 22:08:29 +0800 <XR4Work> Thats from the @PistolWhipVR
1334488338150039553 2020-12-03 21:23:08 +0800 <XR4Work>  https://t.co/IXrS2k6yWt
1334486866029002752 2020-12-03 21:17:17 +0800 <XR4Work> Not much into rhythm games (largely got none) but as I've convinced myself I'm a descendent of the #Vikings I'm really looking forward to this! And the song from the demo by @windroseband is stuck in my head.
1334485417832243202 2020-12-03 21:11:31 +0800 <XR4Work> @Justin_Moving @waywardstrategy I'm ready for some drum racing!
1334484986536230913 2020-12-03 21:09:48 +0800 <XR4Work> Hi #VR peeps. If you haven't checked out @UtopiaVRio yet they are a low friction, web XR meeting platform with some amazing environments to meet in. They just launched thier Winter Wonderland and a giveaway for users who register  https://t.co/thboucCFfo c my youtube for a vid!
1334474264687337472 2020-12-03 20:27:12 +0800 <XR4Work> Thanks @Viveport for bringing us fresh new gaming content each month. A suggestion to also alert us to new apps in the business and productivity categories. I'm bias but assume there are maybe 1-2 others out there interested.🤔 Right? 😕Hello... 😆
1334472471345508352 2020-12-03 20:20:05 +0800 <XR4Work> @VRAussie @bmfshow @ImmersedRobot put me on to doing this through Sidequest which works great also and has a few other settings beside. Had not know this and will likely go this route in the future.
1334302854694178816 2020-12-03 09:06:05 +0800 <XR4Work> @mehdi_akkari Maybe you could release it in chapters?
1334207455761473537 2020-12-03 02:47:00 +0800 <XR4Work> I have 3 grown sons and 8 grandkids, 5 of playing age who would love to have some #blastonvr merch while we play. Ill still win anyway!
1334166983106039808 2020-12-03 00:06:11 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey, I can relate. My sons are all good artists. My one son @waywardstrategy did my logo but me, I'm embarrassed of my own handwriting!
1334157693527920647 2020-12-02 23:29:16 +0800 <XR4Work> Thanks Ill check that out!
1334152570185650178 2020-12-02 23:08:54 +0800 <XR4Work> So eager for this. Im going to be on vacation when this launches but taking my Quest and laptop so I can still play during downtime!
1334151792179998723 2020-12-02 23:05:49 +0800 <XR4Work> Oh really? Tell me more!
1334149913551233028 2020-12-02 22:58:21 +0800 <XR4Work> Thanks Matt! Might be a topic to revisit on your show!? So what do you record at?
1334148134524628992 2020-12-02 22:51:17 +0800 <XR4Work> So you maybe haven't tested it yourself? Sorry to ask so many questions but what was the source? Maybe I could go back and check with who wrote it.
1334145197601648640 2020-12-02 22:39:36 +0800 <XR4Work> Guess i better eat all the cookies?
1334138879360847875 2020-12-02 22:14:30 +0800 <XR4Work> In my particular case where i look at business related apps and @Viveport splits apps into categories I have found some real gems like @Noda_Tech, @3Dorganon, @vreducation (Engage), @Skylect_cloud under the Business sort feature
1334137166100918272 2020-12-02 22:07:42 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey @bmfshow you did an episode on a set of batch files for the Quest that changed the recording settings so you can record at 16:9 1080p. Does this batch file still work on Quest 2?
1334103919061061635 2020-12-02 19:55:35 +0800 <XR4Work> @RenjiBijoy @Forbes @ImmersedVR Outstanding! Congratulations Renji. Can't wait to see what you all do in the future.
1334103225964916737 2020-12-02 19:52:50 +0800 <XR4Work> Viveport is great. It's like search through the thrift store for interesting things you'd never find elsewhere. Actually their selection has been getting better recently. I always feel like I get my subscription worth a year.
1334101332077268995 2020-12-02 19:45:18 +0800 <XR4Work> Love @TRIPPVR! This goes Right in my To Do list for today.
1334098161405751296 2020-12-02 19:32:42 +0800 <XR4Work> @PhaserLockInt @StackUpDotOrg Thank you for doing this. My son and daughter in law were both service members and I know how much this means to them and families who care about them.
1334097108417261578 2020-12-02 19:28:31 +0800 <XR4Work> Really enjoyed doing this. The platform is so powerful and the bots are a unique feature I've not seen anywhere else. Looking forward to spending more time building and leveraging the platform.
1333732497260212225 2020-12-01 19:19:41 +0800 <XR4Work> @dr_oculus @TheRoomGame @Survios It does seem repetitive and anexity producing but with reason as you uncover the story behind the character you play and her motivations.
1333567004196933643 2020-12-01 08:22:04 +0800 <XR4Work> @dr_oculus @TheRoomGame @Survios Played Westworld and found it a great game. Really enjoyed it. Helps if your a fan of the movies and show but not totally necessary. Nice mix of Sci fi and horror. Played it too the end which says it all for me.
1333562662823878662 2020-12-01 08:04:49 +0800 <XR4Work> So tonight I had to uninstall apps to make room for an upgrade to another app ON MY TV. I love tech most of the time but sometimes...  https://t.co/ziXUiHEDDo
1333373418218147841 2020-11-30 19:32:50 +0800 <XR4Work> Thanks Mike. Will share this over on the Facebook group  https://t.co/GJ06mlEx1P
1333016529550651393 2020-11-29 19:54:41 +0800 <XR4Work> Will at this to the reading list. Finishing #VRX at the moment which I'm really enjoying.
1332666067571892225 2020-11-28 20:42:04 +0800 <XR4Work> @LLCGamingVR You know I hear about Facebook having but really don't understand the platform. It's watch someone streaming on it who discussed and educated me on the platform.
1332665727162216452 2020-11-28 20:40:43 +0800 <XR4Work> @stew_rtsmith Don't know much about it but @htcvive is supposed to have a new HMD launching early next year. Of course you could do #WMR and grab a HP #ReverbG2
1332660922880561154 2020-11-28 20:21:38 +0800 <XR4Work> Is the time of the Augmented soldier here?
1332657005962686465 2020-11-28 20:06:04 +0800 <XR4Work> @amandablain Got Lone Echo, Stormland, Asgards Wrath and Brass Tactics for the Quest. Lone Echo has been amazing. The others haven't seen any air time since I've been in that world.
1332656279270141952 2020-11-28 20:03:11 +0800 <XR4Work> @mixedrealityTV @htcvive Definitely a platform that doesn't get enough notice. Has many of the needed collaboration tools. Great for small group meetings.
1332653857604825090 2020-11-28 19:53:33 +0800 <XR4Work> @XRenthusiastmtl This is a great tip this time of year as I'm sure many people will have this issue.
1332489271970816001 2020-11-28 08:59:33 +0800 <XR4Work> @dr_oculus Oh man picked this up worth 3 other titles today. Thought I'd snack on each one and get a taste of each but haven't left Lone Echo since I started it hours ago. Unbelievable that they accomplished the movement mechanics they did with no motion sickness.
1332300705596665856 2020-11-27 20:30:15 +0800 <XR4Work> @WanadevStudio Getting lots of practice on Drunken Dwarves by @windroseband looking forward to more.
1332065546939019270 2020-11-27 04:55:49 +0800 <XR4Work> @OneMangryGamer @proputtvr @milk74180 Is like fishing, your not really trying to win / catch anything is all about the escape!
1331980789223989248 2020-11-26 23:19:01 +0800 <XR4Work> @OneMangryGamer @proputtvr @milk74180 The Top Golf venue is really special. I've tried a lot of meeting and collaboration spaces and would love to use this to hold meetings and team building gatherings! @proputtvr @Rengle820
1331941895287820289 2020-11-26 20:44:28 +0800 <XR4Work> @inkyelbows @ImmersedVR I use a Bluetooth headset connected to my pc and an app called Braina. I'm in the same room with my system and this works great.
1331649831086026757 2020-11-26 01:23:55 +0800 <XR4Work> Just watching for that sale now...
1331560089870807040 2020-11-25 19:27:19 +0800 <XR4Work> @tomsportsjourno Hi Tom! Sending out a prayer for you that you find peace.
1331559349664223234 2020-11-25 19:24:22 +0800 <XR4Work> @RinloGame Yes I'm not versed on game development. What are the functional roles in the team? Does it split around art, sound, design, code by functional skill?
1331361999486377984 2020-11-25 06:20:10 +0800 <XR4Work> Picked up a cool vinyl decal for my #Quest2 over at  https://t.co/OWbvqyeY4i The owner Brandon was very responsive and worked to make sure it was exactly right. If you're in the market I can recommend them.  https://t.co/Lc2jXpcPnN
1331305065982857218 2020-11-25 02:33:56 +0800 <XR4Work> @inkyelbows @ImmersedVR Outstanding! I love @ImmersedVR and did several videos for my YouTube page on it. Have you tried voice recognition? I use it a lot now given I'm a terrible typist IRL let alone in vr.
1331304522103320577 2020-11-25 02:31:47 +0800 <XR4Work> @resolutiongame @CookOutGame And a holiday sale maybe???
1331304104061259778 2020-11-25 02:30:07 +0800 <XR4Work> Love @MeetinVR and can't wait to try this out tonight!
1331233698587561988 2020-11-24 21:50:21 +0800 <XR4Work> We are trying @immersivt @Vr4Wrk  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl
1331233151218225152 2020-11-24 21:48:11 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy you should totally get in on this.
1331231940264005634 2020-11-24 21:43:22 +0800 <XR4Work> And may I add as I stare turning 60 in the eye, Getting old is not for the faint of heart.

1331197453274656770 2020-11-24 19:26:19 +0800 <XR4Work> @MsFindlater @steve_bambury @GESSeducation Love @vreducation platform. They now have an app in the @oculus store for easy access. I have a video overview on my YouTube site if it's helpful.  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl
1331194044001693698 2020-11-24 19:12:47 +0800 <XR4Work> @CathyHackl Still going to be a thing just need the right people to scale it and make it practical and have a business case.
1331192999733125121 2020-11-24 19:08:38 +0800 <XR4Work> Ahhhh good ole Duke. Don't think they could make that game today.
1331192635730571264 2020-11-24 19:07:11 +0800 <XR4Work> Your app is truly unique and helpful to users. I how to use it in my hospital treating patients with anexity one day. Thanks for your efforts with it.
1331025918928760833 2020-11-24 08:04:42 +0800 <XR4Work> Hi @OculusSupport really appreciate this move on your part whether it helps me or not. My invoice is dated Oct 12 so I guess it would not apply?
1330894846509289476 2020-11-23 23:23:52 +0800 <XR4Work> Me trying to figure out how to spin this as a work and productivity offering...  https://t.co/hid6mJLSCI
1330888178174107648 2020-11-23 22:57:23 +0800 <XR4Work> We got a chance to try this out and show you over on the VR 4 Work YouTube site  https://t.co/piehxiH58L and can attest to the millions of combinations available for every type and expression. You can even include avatar bots for visitors to interact with.
1330887072530350083 2020-11-23 22:52:59 +0800 <XR4Work> OK I'm genuinely interested to know who is looking to purchase an HTC HMD over other headsets right now. Let us know your reasoning and use case.
1330840858829197312 2020-11-23 19:49:21 +0800 <XR4Work> @bccasteel Headcrab turkey from #halflife
1330297360107311111 2020-11-22 07:49:41 +0800 <XR4Work> @amandablain IT director during the day and at night, let's just say Batman and I have never been seen in the same room at the same time... 😉
1330118268087128064 2020-11-21 19:58:02 +0800 <XR4Work> Cool subscribed! And I'll be able to give away an Oculus quest 4 by the time I hit 10k! 🤣
1330112958723207168 2020-11-21 19:36:56 +0800 <XR4Work> @vrmancave Seems to only be 2 choices, both just covers over the stock faceplate. Cloth or silicone.
1329967527905071106 2020-11-21 09:59:02 +0800 <XR4Work> @Rengle820 @proputtvr So I'm curious did I sell you on it? 😁
1329966867235147776 2020-11-21 09:56:25 +0800 <XR4Work> @Rengle820 @proputtvr Yeah here I am worrying too get the word out not thinking about my audience! 🤔😅
1329966475516448771 2020-11-21 09:54:52 +0800 <XR4Work> Man my number one feature request part #Quest2 is a wider FOV
1329965600320364545 2020-11-21 09:51:23 +0800 <XR4Work> @proputtvr is bringing an experience like you describe to its world. Nice clubhouse severance casual games, a customizable media element, designed around a multiplayer/social experience. They will be offering a sneak peek as part of the upcoming holiday sales weekend. Check it!
1329879193115455489 2020-11-21 04:08:02 +0800 <XR4Work> Was this the location for the final fight scene in the #JamesBond film Goldeneye?
1329870511774470144 2020-11-21 03:33:32 +0800 <XR4Work> Anyone out there using this in the enterprise? What's your experience?
1329864543946752001 2020-11-21 03:09:49 +0800 <XR4Work> #giftagamer @waywardstrategy I've watched you grow since the early #warwind days. You are like a son to me!

1329860966289342465 2020-11-21 02:55:36 +0800 <XR4Work> Its a blast to play! And the demo song is about Drunken Dwarves. I mean Vikings, Drunken Dwarves and Drumming, how could you not love this!
1329859040831098880 2020-11-21 02:47:57 +0800 <XR4Work> @stormlandvr compatibility!? Now I have to put it back on my wishlist. Come on Holiday sales!
1329809383765794826 2020-11-20 23:30:38 +0800 <XR4Work> Yeah its like bonus bling and will really pop against the white. They should really play that up. Id probably buy others if they did a Blue, Green. ect. @vrcover
1329808017014091781 2020-11-20 23:25:12 +0800 <XR4Work>  https://t.co/wbKRKnqgFI
1329807176270016515 2020-11-20 23:21:52 +0800 <XR4Work> And ordered!
1329805972676730881 2020-11-20 23:17:05 +0800 <XR4Work> Whoa, this is funny then you realize how TRUE it is...
1329805514738442241 2020-11-20 23:15:15 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey this looks really interesting. Im in! just subscribed. Looking forward to learning about playing! #videogames #science
1329800405946142722 2020-11-20 22:54:57 +0800 <XR4Work> Been on a roll lately. Several new videos over on the YouTube channel. come check out our overview of  @mootup3d, @LearnBrite,@loom_ai and the new VR keyboard overlay in @ImmersedVR   https://t.co/piehxiYGxl
1329786462078869507 2020-11-20 21:59:33 +0800 <XR4Work> Im there!
1329786211737563137 2020-11-20 21:58:33 +0800 <XR4Work> WHAT! This is AWESOME for new users (and a bit frustrating for veterans, or at least me, who doesn't own this yet). Well will watch for sales next week. @OculusGaming
1329784059921268736 2020-11-20 21:50:00 +0800 <XR4Work> @GAMERTAGVR Wander, Nature Treks, Tripp, Curious Tale, Angry Birds, Real VR Fishing
1329753128372211713 2020-11-20 19:47:06 +0800 <XR4Work> I like @Viveport but do find the versions often lag behind other platforms. It's likely up to the vendor to update but would think vive could require some attention by those selling on the platform.
1329747839036108802 2020-11-20 19:26:05 +0800 <XR4Work> I'll be tuning in, will you?
1329488736413831168 2020-11-20 02:16:30 +0800 <XR4Work> Maybe not Christmas but winter themed Merry Snowball VR on Steam. actually pretty fun. There is a new skiing sim out on Sidequest id like to try also.
1329466071389151232 2020-11-20 00:46:26 +0800 <XR4Work> I'm a bit surprised more consumers not preferring seeing VR content being done in VR (my preference). Of course, lots of science in what makes up poll results but makes me wonder what the dynamic is.
1329394494140276742 2020-11-19 20:02:01 +0800 <XR4Work> Yes #vr enthusiasts is so much more than gaming. I do planning @Noda_Tech, email web browsing @vSpatialVR, @ImmersedVR, review architecture @resolveBIM, attend lectures @vreducation, have business meetings @MeetinVR and study anatomy @3Dorganon expand your Horizons!
1329225503773962241 2020-11-19 08:50:30 +0800 <XR4Work> @neitey @ID_AA_Carmack @DrBeef @UploadVR @GAMERTAGVR @VoodooDE_Gaming @CasandChary So release before end of the year?
1329206826869661704 2020-11-19 07:36:17 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey glad to see productivity apps like @ImmersedVR covered! It's not all just gaming in vr.
1329101397439156225 2020-11-19 00:37:21 +0800 <XR4Work> I can see all these in my library eventually.
1329031471504519169 2020-11-18 19:59:29 +0800 <XR4Work> Been on a roll lately. Several new videos over on the YouTube channel. come check out our overview of @mootup3d, @LearnBrite, @loom_ai and the new VR keyboard overlay in @ImmersedVR  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl
1329026857153519616 2020-11-18 19:41:09 +0800 <XR4Work> @xrseapod Very interested in solid predictions for next year. What will htc come out with in 2021? What will be the focus for quest 2 in 21? Does Valve have anything in the wings? How about business uptake, specific sector increases? Thanks!
1328867366869078016 2020-11-18 09:07:24 +0800 <XR4Work> Your too young to become a grumpy or youtuber  https://t.co/yEzuzU6I70
1328866906540027904 2020-11-18 09:05:34 +0800 <XR4Work> Road trips. Wish I got to travel more so I could listen to more books!
1328852597093117953 2020-11-18 08:08:42 +0800 <XR4Work> @TarzanVR @Steam Just spent an hour playing and had a blast! Love the mix of mechanics used and the theme and envornment. I'm am old guy so have memories of the Tarzan movies as a kid. So cool to hear those snips from the old shows.
1328765753751957513 2020-11-18 02:23:37 +0800 <XR4Work> preordered on @audible_com !

1328668882488479744 2020-11-17 19:58:41 +0800 <XR4Work> @kefimochi And where is your job openings listing? 👀😉
1328666598241144832 2020-11-17 19:49:37 +0800 <XR4Work> @Tsukinune Yeah early on VR was HTC's market to lose. And they did. Now they are having on Vive XR Suite and a wireless headset that's too late to the party.
1328516057565368323 2020-11-17 09:51:25 +0800 <XR4Work> Boil em mash em stick em in a stew.
1328454564215992320 2020-11-17 05:47:04 +0800 <XR4Work> Was just listening to @MyEdTechLife podcast with the @GreenScreenGal . Really great, fun podcast. I really enjoyed listening. I have 8 grandkids and my wife oversees 4 of them at home now schooling online. Would hope all #EDUcators would pick up some of these tips!
1328434553489387530 2020-11-17 04:27:33 +0800 <XR4Work> Can a font actually look Russian? Cause that looks Cyrillic almost.
1328372195115094018 2020-11-17 00:19:45 +0800 <XR4Work> Love seeing these VR platforms continue to evolve and expand functionality. What do you need available to you before you use VR 4 Work (see what I did there?).
1328371622278025218 2020-11-17 00:17:29 +0800 <XR4Work> Great platform we just covered over at the VR4Work Youtube page  https://t.co/b11zzoJrmn
1328357242165465089 2020-11-16 23:20:20 +0800 <XR4Work> Interesting given the level of concentration in depth I'm strategy required for many of the games you play. Conversely I struggle which strategy games myself but I'm getting older and don't have the cognitive elasticity anymore.
1328336424773562369 2020-11-16 21:57:37 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey, im up for it! Will check it out today.

1328068866707238914 2020-11-16 04:14:26 +0800 <XR4Work> @inkyelbows @ImmersedVR @loom_ai Hey @inkyelbows thanks so much for that! Hope you find some interesting stuff. I have a lot of fun exploring these platforms and seeing what the future holds.
1327993079157190658 2020-11-15 23:13:17 +0800 <XR4Work> @inkyelbows @ImmersedVR Nice compare pics. Love to see users showing how they actually use these apps.
1327991285874044934 2020-11-15 23:06:10 +0800 <XR4Work> Love to see @Noda_Tech get this attention! Great vr productivity app.
1327991004885037061 2020-11-15 23:05:03 +0800 <XR4Work> We need a hash tag for this. Stay safe #goggleupwithquest @oculus #quest2

1327662016639721473 2020-11-15 01:17:46 +0800 <XR4Work> @XRenthusiastmtl @OculusSupport Very cool. This is a world I know nothing about. Maybe we could chat sometime if you don't mind sharing what tools you use and what the typical work day using VR is like for you?
1327660352914513920 2020-11-15 01:11:09 +0800 <XR4Work> @XRenthusiastmtl @OculusSupport Would be very interested to hear how you use it for work. You might tell by my name tag but I'm interested in that kind of thing.
1327659850105561090 2020-11-15 01:09:09 +0800 <XR4Work> @EvanKirstel Safest kid in the world! 😳
1327659318049714182 2020-11-15 01:07:02 +0800 <XR4Work> @XRenthusiastmtl @OculusSupport Yeah I'd have some withdrawl if I didn't have mine for a week. We are traveling in a few weeks and I'm already planning how to pack it.

1327627041810870277 2020-11-14 22:58:47 +0800 <XR4Work> @purplemikey @CybershoesVR So it's not a rec room room?
1327626415299325953 2020-11-14 22:56:18 +0800 <XR4Work> Planning the weekends VR time. I think some planning time in @Noda_Tech then record in @LearnBrite and some @RinloGame and @PhaserLockInt #final_assault for some fun time.
1327625774174773250 2020-11-14 22:53:45 +0800 <XR4Work> @John_Westra @AppliedVRhealth Joyce. Would love to see a journal of your use of VR during your recuperation.
1327625718470234118 2020-11-14 22:53:32 +0800 <XR4Work> @PhaserLockInt Hey thanks for the offer. My content focuses on VR for business and professionals but I've been known to play a game of Final Assault or two!  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl
1327622777193566211 2020-11-14 22:41:50 +0800 <XR4Work> Uhhh ok, sure.
1327621263070793729 2020-11-14 22:35:49 +0800 <XR4Work> You know it's tempting to give up the current gig and consider a career change to the immersive tech industry 🤔
1327592728801275904 2020-11-14 20:42:26 +0800 <XR4Work> Big @oculus #Quest2 update dropping this week. I'm sure the focus will be on the 90hz refresh rate but I'm excited about the voice commands and Rec features. Voice is the future for most text input in vr.   https://t.co/yUEr8U18Kp
1327334618585063427 2020-11-14 03:36:48 +0800 <XR4Work> I have often thought the best controller for VR would be hand tracking accommodated by a glove for better fidelity and accuracy.
1327276219105226753 2020-11-13 23:44:44 +0800 <XR4Work> id wonder if you'd be able to do any editing?
1327232322710736898 2020-11-13 20:50:19 +0800 <XR4Work> @VirBELA1 is a complete package when it comes to meeting, collaboration and events. Check out our overview video at  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl

1327226587432038400 2020-11-13 20:27:31 +0800 <XR4Work> Sign me up. The beta has been great. Just missing being able to play with others.
1327226192626388999 2020-11-13 20:25:57 +0800 <XR4Work> Wow! Nice! Now if I can just do in app recording of sessions I might move into a @spatialxr room semi-permenantly!
1327225677729427458 2020-11-13 20:23:54 +0800 <XR4Work> Yes this is exciting news! No more sideloading. Jumped right on this last night and installed and tested it out. Will need to do an updated video now that it's out and hopefully drive some attention to it.
1327223494342479872 2020-11-13 20:15:14 +0800 <XR4Work> Check out and vote over @VRFocus for The Better Than Reality Awards.  https://t.co/BBCbKh1dwM show your love and appreciation to those devs, platforms and apps you use and spread the word on the great work being done in #VR.
1327034386504708096 2020-11-13 07:43:47 +0800 <XR4Work> Got an update for @Viveport today. Just got a chance to jump in and look around. Nice graphic and envornmental update! That and the new titles being released are getting better every month. If you haven't looked at Viveport in a while it's a good time to check back in.

1326705271251628032 2020-11-12 09:56:00 +0800 <XR4Work> Yep have this on my wishlist. See a lot of potential and variety of gameplay with this title.

1326495730601746435 2020-11-11 20:03:21 +0800 <XR4Work> Would be very interesting to understand Microsoft reason for not getting into this. Under @satyanadella they just seem to be more focused and less likely to do consumer add ons.
1326495064126844933 2020-11-11 20:00:43 +0800 <XR4Work> Have you tried the @htcvive Sync Avatar creator yet? I actually like how that formed out for me. Find the one in @spatialxr the most interesting in an uncanny valley sort of way.
1326242164049911810 2020-11-11 03:15:46 +0800 <XR4Work> 😆
1326241798289764352 2020-11-11 03:14:19 +0800 <XR4Work> Someone needs to make a horror movie here.
1326131205075558400 2020-11-10 19:54:52 +0800 <XR4Work> Those dojos convinced me the force is not with me. 🙄 Really enjoyed the games though.
1325963031763951618 2020-11-10 08:46:36 +0800 <XR4Work> @wrestvr Ya know it's because of you guys that I'll never sign up for intergalactic travel in a stasis pod. Totally your fault.
1325949639095365632 2020-11-10 07:53:23 +0800 <XR4Work> @oculus @medalofhonor @Respawn There have been Other great games for VR this year for sure but this is my number one anticipated game for 2020. Day 1 purchase.
1325945502878355456 2020-11-10 07:36:57 +0800 <XR4Work> @WalkingDeadVR Whenever you think the Covid pandemic is bad think Casey.
1325840606879477766 2020-11-10 00:40:08 +0800 <XR4Work> @WanadevStudio All over this  https://t.co/KlBE8NEt9T
1325768459746152448 2020-11-09 19:53:27 +0800 <XR4Work> @Rengle820 Yes! I'm fortunate to have gotten into this beta and whenever I find a block of 15 minutes I jump in on this. Can't wait to be in here with others. Great hang out atmosphere and environment.
1325585716726951938 2020-11-09 07:47:17 +0800 <XR4Work> @EducatorsVR @Minecraft @pcgamer Wow! @waywardstrategy

1325158288170901507 2020-11-08 03:28:50 +0800 <XR4Work> @TheHappyLass definitely think we need to do a combined show overviewing the platform when this launches!
1325097246929506309 2020-11-07 23:26:17 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey I'm glad to see the popularity of the device. Good problem to have. I have 8 devices I've gotten for work that will be shared so need to be able to clean them so as soon as they are in I'll be ordering!
1325060474124316674 2020-11-07 21:00:10 +0800 <XR4Work> @TheHappyLass Well I think one thing is the user isn't in vr but using their camera IRL. I think you can pop into VR seemlessly but very anxious to try this out and see how they translate IRL to the 3d meeting

1324741973475905536 2020-11-06 23:54:33 +0800 <XR4Work> Beautiful thing.
1324741599046197248 2020-11-06 23:53:04 +0800 <XR4Work> Check out the book #VRX for a medical perspective on what VR can do for anxiety and pain. Also, a great medium to get you moving.

1324733520892190723 2020-11-06 23:20:58 +0800 <XR4Work> @VrVerdict @1PM @proputtvr @Rengle820 @purplemikey Oh I'm on the Beta so don't think I can get back to the course from there.
1324733207581876225 2020-11-06 23:19:43 +0800 <XR4Work> @vrcover Sold out already! Thats good AND bad!
1324732694622687233 2020-11-06 23:17:41 +0800 <XR4Work> Silicone cover from @vrcover for @oculus #Quest2 already sold out!
1324678759564398592 2020-11-06 19:43:22 +0800 <XR4Work> @EricVBailey It's all in the swype... And editing, Lots of editing
1324526488444719106 2020-11-06 09:38:18 +0800 <XR4Work> Wow your bringing back memories of our homeschooling our kids. How I would have loved to have the VR resources we have today.
1324519126728101889 2020-11-06 09:09:02 +0800 <XR4Work> Hoping I've bought my last laptop and will do all my computing in an HMD within the next 2 years. Of course there are still a lot of wired hmd's out there.
1324512940263956482 2020-11-06 08:44:27 +0800 <XR4Work> My new VR gaming obsession is #unknightly by @PortalStudiosVR. Best stealth game on VR right now. Crouching in the dark stealing coin from guards assassinating targets in a medieval world. Great fun!
1324505024882483201 2020-11-06 08:13:00 +0800 <XR4Work> One of your darker titles but interesting.
1324504454926864389 2020-11-06 08:10:44 +0800 <XR4Work> @AtomBombBody I like the headset on the head but I'm biased  https://t.co/6qbbHFYbAb
1324503394766213122 2020-11-06 08:06:32 +0800 <XR4Work> I don't know guys. Meat and condiments encased in bread. Checking the boxes for me.
1324315473023012869 2020-11-05 19:39:48 +0800 <XR4Work> Wonder what @htcvive and @PicoInteractive think as it seems their primary markets.
1324314399805493250 2020-11-05 19:35:32 +0800 <XR4Work> @VRBugStream I haven't played it but messed around with a game called @TowerTagVR on @Viveport this sounds like.
1324313295826915329 2020-11-05 19:31:08 +0800 <XR4Work> Great article. VR will start to be accepted in the work place when we have evidence of it solving problems as demonstrated here.
1324311474630774784 2020-11-05 19:23:54 +0800 <XR4Work> Excellent list to review if your looking for a immersive meeting space.
1324310172567805953 2020-11-05 19:18:44 +0800 <XR4Work> In my play time I find in only peripheraly aware of the surroundings being focused on the runes/beats. I hope there are ways you build in an opportunity for players to appreciate the scenery. Like the idea of some story built in also.
1324309215192690693 2020-11-05 19:14:56 +0800 <XR4Work> Sounds like I have successfully handed down the family trait.

1323389182371385346 2020-11-03 06:19:03 +0800 <XR4Work> @SadlyItsBradley Yeah I learned that lesson the hard way. Be critical and risk the ire of the faithful. Even being one of them!
1323388221838032897 2020-11-03 06:15:14 +0800 <XR4Work> @PhaserLockInt @PlayStation Any news on the @Viveport version getting the update?
1322920766548135943 2020-11-01 23:17:44 +0800 <XR4Work> @amandablain 😆 You are hilarious. Thanks for the regular dose of humor.

1322581978106023936 2020-11-01 00:51:30 +0800 <XR4Work> @VR_Rosie Oh that's going to be stuck in my head all day now! 🤣
1322580626898378752 2020-11-01 00:46:08 +0800 <XR4Work> So think you can avoid creepy, scary clowns in an sci-fi, horror game? Umm no @wrestvr
1322544872545542145 2020-10-31 22:24:03 +0800 <XR4Work> @bccasteel Some likely find this very scary 😱
1322522758480277510 2020-10-31 20:56:11 +0800 <XR4Work> Registered and looking forward to it!
1322519511698935809 2020-10-31 20:43:17 +0800 <XR4Work> @PhaserLockInt Will we see this update on @Viveport ?
1322518375860490241 2020-10-31 20:38:46 +0800 <XR4Work> Why am I hearing "spooky scary skeleton... " when I watch this? 😳
1322517996854824962 2020-10-31 20:37:16 +0800 <XR4Work> Just got on the boat. Guess I've got some beach time coming up.

1322495875223085056 2020-10-31 19:09:22 +0800 <XR4Work> My hope is to not have to buy another gaming pc in the future.
1322318304854351872 2020-10-31 07:23:46 +0800 <XR4Work> Picked up a few titles at the @Steam sale tonight. The Stealth Bundle @PortalStudiosVR Unknightly, @EspireVr 1, @NeatCorp #BudgetCuts2 Ready for the weekend!
1322221011740352512 2020-10-31 00:57:09 +0800 <XR4Work> Well typically because the weird is what's outside the window!
1322220635381239808 2020-10-31 00:55:39 +0800 <XR4Work> OK @ATT explain to me why the unlocked devices i have aren't allowed to use wifi calling? I know a company that will do this ya know.
1322180795721781250 2020-10-30 22:17:21 +0800 <XR4Work> I think I'm going to start a channel covering the content available in @Viveport . I find it a great offering with a bargain bin feel where you find lots of great gems.  https://t.co/SDUiEjApTG
1322173758795403264 2020-10-30 21:49:23 +0800 <XR4Work> Great resource for finding VR vendors by industry category.
1322173548421668864 2020-10-30 21:48:33 +0800 <XR4Work> Yep, gotta get on that airship next...
1322173225720254470 2020-10-30 21:47:16 +0800 <XR4Work> 90's? that's tonight at our house! 😄
1322126367778111488 2020-10-30 18:41:04 +0800 <XR4Work> Oh yeah. I'm on it. Been playing around with it. It's tricky to set up correctly. Found you really have to keep your head still while finding the right keys. If you lift your headset while setting up, the position is out of whack.
1321860185091051520 2020-10-30 01:03:21 +0800 <XR4Work> Signed up and looking forward to it!

1321601599932899331 2020-10-29 07:55:50 +0800 <XR4Work> @PhaserLockInt @StarcadeArcade Hey great suggestion. I think this is in my @Viveport subscription. I'll check it out.
1321505916294959104 2020-10-29 01:35:37 +0800 <XR4Work> Whoa #XSXFridgeSweeps this is real!

1321504441560977409 2020-10-29 01:29:45 +0800 <XR4Work> Well Tron just YES but otherwise, frankly, RTS titles. I mean #FinalAssault is a rare RTS jewel one can find. There are a few good Tower Defense but not real RTS.
1321503572362698754 2020-10-29 01:26:18 +0800 <XR4Work> Im afraid i agree with Buzz...

1321399612851298304 2020-10-28 18:33:12 +0800 <XR4Work> @DennyCloudhead hi Denny while I'm a Pistol Whip fan I'm frankly as excited about your announcement regarding your all day collab platform as your game. Would be eager to help test and generate social content about it when the time is right.
1321397042057535489 2020-10-28 18:22:59 +0800 <XR4Work> Ok this is on my list for an overview on the VR 4 Work site as soon as you open up. Very eager to see what your building and how it can be used by business and professionals.
1321120950604210187 2020-10-28 00:05:54 +0800 <XR4Work> Yeah but a ways to go with your 2500+ twitter followers!
1321114406130982913 2020-10-27 23:39:54 +0800 <XR4Work> Had no doubt.
1321113844685615109 2020-10-27 23:37:40 +0800 <XR4Work> Cant figure out why my Facebook link shows a Twitter icon?
1321113632378359811 2020-10-27 23:36:49 +0800 <XR4Work> VR is riding a wave of adoption that's growing steadily and, at some point, will land in YOUR business. Join your peers in keeping up on the latest by following the VR 4 Work Facebook group  https://t.co/7K0c8aGi43  and YouTube  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl Stop by and check them out!
1321054272977588224 2020-10-27 19:40:57 +0800 <XR4Work> Wow this brings no code to a whole new level. Not hard to extrapolate this out to other world building scenerios.
1321053550215127041 2020-10-27 19:38:05 +0800 <XR4Work> @WanadevStudio Hey congrats! Love me some zombie shooting fun but don't forget my drum loving Vikings! #Ragna_Rock

1320736871983554566 2020-10-26 22:39:43 +0800 <XR4Work> Very exciting! Got to take a look at the Acadicus platform some months ago and was blown away then by the content and capability.  https://t.co/pVFLJVyOF6

1320680497685667847 2020-10-26 18:55:42 +0800 <XR4Work> @VRCon2020 @NathieVR I remember back in the 90's being on vacation at Niagara falls. They're was this arcade attraction called Dactyl Nightmare. Very low poly and slow but it fueled this germ of an idea regarding VR being a thing that never left me. Then I saw a Vive back in 2016 and bought one!
1320677949742473216 2020-10-26 18:45:34 +0800 <XR4Work> Love this depiction! Hopefully most people get the serious nature of the message and not just think it's a humorous meme.
1320676877674156032 2020-10-26 18:41:19 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey just informational but @OculusSupport did come out and state using one account on two headsets sites not break terms of service and accounts would not be banned.
1320348078982025218 2020-10-25 20:54:47 +0800 <XR4Work> Is just like to see some of these go on sale! Would love to pick up Lone Echo, Stormland, Asgards Wrath, Arktika, Brass Tactics.. Yeah I have a bit of a wish list!
1319964955500777472 2020-10-24 19:32:23 +0800 <XR4Work> Great band and music I discovered through the VR game #Ragna_Rock by @WanadevStudio
1319963186494205952 2020-10-24 19:25:22 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey Nick was there an email with the code when you first set it up? Is been so long for me I can't remember and the process may have changed. Also the devs are pretty active on their discord so you may want to try there also.
1319768396481941506 2020-10-24 06:31:20 +0800 <XR4Work> Don't forget #paganpeak!
1319763414135209985 2020-10-24 06:11:32 +0800 <XR4Work> They're are some exciting titles coming out but this is top of my list. Purchase day one.
1319742643153391616 2020-10-24 04:49:00 +0800 <XR4Work> Now that you mention it... Sounds like something to put on my to do list for this weekend
1319600090626072576 2020-10-23 19:22:33 +0800 <XR4Work> Great session with Tomas who showed me around @MeetinVR yesterday. Great platform for meeting and collab in vr. They have some exciting updates coming soon. Watch the VR 4 Work  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl channel for more info.  https://t.co/48HTx3ufbg
1319588446105706497 2020-10-23 18:36:16 +0800 <XR4Work> Lots of great talent to pick from!
1319582417326362625 2020-10-23 18:12:19 +0800 <XR4Work> Great deal here. If you haven't tried Viveport it's well worth the sub. Lots of great titles to try out. I'm currently playing @wrestvr, @RinloGame &amp; Quivr using my #Quest2 and @VRDesktop
1319374034547601408 2020-10-23 04:24:17 +0800 <XR4Work> @sage_vr Typically, i have a few games going at a time and rotate and frankly, if a game doesn't hold my attention i often dont go back.
1319252503851008000 2020-10-22 20:21:22 +0800 <XR4Work> OK I laughed out loud. 😆
1319252055492624385 2020-10-22 20:19:35 +0800 <XR4Work> Whoa! this is truly amazing.
1319251661039136769 2020-10-22 20:18:01 +0800 <XR4Work> Voice rec is the answer here. Sure some light editing is always necessary but Ill keep saying it, #vr as a platform screams for voice interaction.
1319251252488720390 2020-10-22 20:16:23 +0800 <XR4Work> Just subscribed!
1319221049096011778 2020-10-22 18:16:22 +0800 <XR4Work> @WanadevStudio Such a blast to play. I've been hitting the lone level of now regularly and not tired of it yet. Multiplayer will really up the fun!
1319080660859052033 2020-10-22 08:58:31 +0800 <XR4Work> @dopefish_lives @waywardstrategy Welcome to the rare niche of stylish gamers.  https://t.co/Wma5ndy6Yp
1319079779061141506 2020-10-22 08:55:01 +0800 <XR4Work> Very exciting to see this platform leap out like it has. Looking forward to exploring it more.
1319077407631024129 2020-10-22 08:45:35 +0800 <XR4Work> @wrestvr @VRDesktop Ok thanks. Umm don't feel you have to add any more scares while you're updating! 😅
1319034780416094215 2020-10-22 05:56:12 +0800 <XR4Work> @wrestvr hey Dev having trouble getting past the forest level. Game keeps locking up on me at the first sighting of the creature. 3 x's now after device reboots. Connecting with quest 2 and @VRDesktop
1318897002709659648 2020-10-21 20:48:44 +0800 <XR4Work> @purplemikey @OculusGaming Yeah they seem to be pushing any and all exceptions to the log in requirement to requiring you to buy headsets under @OculusBusiness and in a way pay to get around it.
1318868997178359808 2020-10-21 18:57:26 +0800 <XR4Work> @NathieVR Correction; presentation not pastiche
1318868492641357830 2020-10-21 18:55:26 +0800 <XR4Work> @NathieVR Maybe the prototype shown in their #ViveXRSuite pastiche earlier this week  https://t.co/AxDRev4mjJ
1318863671200796672 2020-10-21 18:36:17 +0800 <XR4Work> @skeeva They showed the prototype in their #ViveXRSuite launch earlier this week.  https://t.co/AxDRev4mjJ not sure how much is actual platform footage and how much is concept.
1318712353861619713 2020-10-21 08:35:00 +0800 <XR4Work> @kojirovr And even small VR devs and enthusiasts who want to help get the word out!
1318709192396558342 2020-10-21 08:22:26 +0800 <XR4Work> @SadlyItsBradley Geez I hate not having an edit option.
1318708298623963137 2020-10-21 08:18:53 +0800 <XR4Work> @wrestvr Playing through now and in the forest. Have to limit play to 30-45 minutes. It's all my heart can take!
1318707095458451457 2020-10-21 08:14:06 +0800 <XR4Work> @SadlyItsBradley HTC have a peak of a new HMD in their #ViveXRSuite launch yesterday.  https://t.co/AxDRev4mjJ
1318706304798609410 2020-10-21 08:10:58 +0800 <XR4Work> @kojirovr Agreed. Id like to see HTC work with some organizations and come up with use cases and examples to give businesses some context to consider how it can impact them.
1318703328184893441 2020-10-21 07:59:08 +0800 <XR4Work> @AlcoveVR @oculus I wish we could rotate the pictures in the wall frames.
1318513467649937409 2020-10-20 19:24:42 +0800 <XR4Work> @WanadevStudio @windroseband @SteamVR I've been playing the demo level at least once a day every day since I found it. Such a blast! Can't wait for the full game.
1318379780463616002 2020-10-20 10:33:28 +0800 <XR4Work> Here we go... https://t.co/gtI19GQp2B

1318327950199169026 2020-10-20 07:07:31 +0800 <XR4Work> Ok trying to play @wrestvr tonight on @Viveport using my #quest2 using #virtualdesktop. By trying I mean taking breaks to get my heart rate down. Looking to be scared this Fall? Put this one on your list.
1318298004193828866 2020-10-20 05:08:31 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey Twitterverse if you're interested in #VR and wonder how you can use it for business or professional use stop by our YouTube site for dozens of videos on platforms you can use to get work done. Retweet us to get the word out!  https://t.co/piehxiH58L
1318234365474836485 2020-10-20 00:55:38 +0800 <XR4Work> @vreducation @htcvive The equivalent of the bleacher seats these days. With VR you are always front row. Hoping to bring more and more into the best seats in the house!
1318232535978151936 2020-10-20 00:48:22 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey @MeetinVR just tried your in app camera system on the pc version. Id really like to talk to a rep regarding doing a overview of how it works and it's features. Very powerful stuff!  https://t.co/9JXMh717XE
1318231791669547013 2020-10-20 00:45:25 +0800 <XR4Work> @sage_vr Hey love what your all about and glad to meet a fellow VR enthusiast with a focus outside of gaming and entertainment.
1318202433642909696 2020-10-19 22:48:45 +0800 <XR4Work> @sage_vr Wait a great VR account to follow and a culinary connoisseur to boot!?
1318201739481403392 2020-10-19 22:46:00 +0800 <XR4Work> @8bitbiologist @frame_vr Preach it brother!  https://t.co/cYNqg58P8K
1318201195920527361 2020-10-19 22:43:50 +0800 <XR4Work> @Cristianohh @echeng Still worth watching on quest 1? @bccasteel
1318200516179001344 2020-10-19 22:41:08 +0800 <XR4Work> @htcvive #XRSUITE launch event tonight (9pm US EDT) taking place on the @vreducation Engage platform. Eager to see what this means for the business and professional use of VR.
1318193689898921986 2020-10-19 22:14:01 +0800 <XR4Work> @freeek323  https://t.co/XZlmzsqbC7
1318193415989956608 2020-10-19 22:12:55 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy If you want scary you need to try a few VR titles. Death Horizon, Dreadhalls, Saints and Sinners, Exorsist, Lies Beneath, 5 Nights At Freddys
1318188043753455617 2020-10-19 21:51:35 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey @MeetinVR want to talk to you about your in app video recording system. How do I get in touch?
1318187249029255168 2020-10-19 21:48:25 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy Was looking at this one myself.
1318144846348079104 2020-10-19 18:59:55 +0800 <XR4Work> @Arnookie @SideQuestVR Yep same here. Submitted a ticket and got an acknowledgement of issues with email and to try again. I guess being overwhelmed is a good problem to have to iron out.
1317960034685538304 2020-10-19 06:45:33 +0800 <XR4Work> Like Vikings? like beating drums? How about songs about drunken dwarves? How about all three in vr? Check out Ragna Rock by @WanadevStudio with music by @windroseband it was a blast playing the early access level on @SteamVR
1317776492651253761 2020-10-18 18:36:13 +0800 <XR4Work> @volgaksoy @MrCatid My thought is the compute will move to the cloud like @Shadow_Official then we just need solid wifi or 5G.
1317623837798944770 2020-10-18 08:29:37 +0800 <XR4Work> @letschat6 Hey congrats! Only platforms I know that serve up to 50 is Engage or Altspace. I just covered Utopia VR which had some nice environments but caps at 30 as does Frame. Ill watch and try and make the celebration!
1317621491916247043 2020-10-18 08:20:18 +0800 <XR4Work> @TheJinXR Whoa! That's a ominous Horizon. Hope all are safe.
1317582968144232448 2020-10-18 05:47:13 +0800 <XR4Work> @purplemikey @matteo311 👍😅
1317573033683521538 2020-10-18 05:07:45 +0800 <XR4Work> @purplemikey @matteo311 What!? What r u doing with that space man?
1317568134727991296 2020-10-18 04:48:17 +0800 <XR4Work> @UtopiaVRio aims to make collaboration using VR as easy as setting up a Zoom video conference.  All web based and available on any platform, Utopia VR is definitely worth a look. Come check it out in our new video  https://t.co/GQb6BjMtz5.
1317567197510815744 2020-10-18 04:44:33 +0800 <XR4Work> @vrmancave Great idea! I'll start looking into this.
1317525507748089857 2020-10-18 01:58:54 +0800 <XR4Work> @vSpatialVR Will tweet this in advance "seems faster" 😅
1317451327555932161 2020-10-17 21:04:08 +0800 <XR4Work> @windroseband @WanadevStudio Ok I'm in. Gonna try this out this weekend.
1317448659441717248 2020-10-17 20:53:32 +0800 <XR4Work> Happy weekend! So I want to get some input from the Twitterverse on what to cover for the YouTube site. What would you like to see? I have platforms lined up and doing this on my own whim is fun but if you have something youd like to see covered reply a suggestion and let me know
1317443966799892480 2020-10-17 20:34:53 +0800 <XR4Work> @MonsterReapers Just started the game and very impressed with the tutorial and depth of mechanics. Went through a few waves in the arena and need more practice but looking forward to seeing what's next.
1317177652764057601 2020-10-17 02:56:39 +0800 <XR4Work> @jackyalcine @shanselman Daily Tech Headlines @acedtect

1317174378560245761 2020-10-17 02:43:38 +0800 <XR4Work> @PhaserLockInt Hey work is gaming with a more boring set of rules and a dull environment.
1317156174886629377 2020-10-17 01:31:18 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy Oh why? I recall this fondly.
1317126410943700993 2020-10-16 23:33:02 +0800 <XR4Work> @VRBugStream @UploadVR Hey @OculusGaming you listening? We are lined up here when you're ready  https://t.co/RwtPNzsPmc
1317125782968373259 2020-10-16 23:30:32 +0800 <XR4Work> @zoom_us  in VR? Yep! @LearnBrite can do it. Connect your Space via the Zoom Marketplace. Find out how here  https://t.co/MTvYoNGbqK
1317124194107330560 2020-10-16 23:24:13 +0800 <XR4Work> @VRBugStream @UploadVR Ive been watching for Lone Echo 1 to have a sale but haven't seen any Rift AAA games have a sale in some time.
1317123143459373062 2020-10-16 23:20:03 +0800 <XR4Work> Tried the  https://t.co/ZyyfkPsFrU @getwolf3d personal avatar creator! #readyplayerme #avatar Yeah, close enough!  https://t.co/K4YmEh4DPD

1317053816554942464 2020-10-16 18:44:34 +0800 <XR4Work> @PeskyCashew @archangelvrgame Oh have this on my @SteamVR wishlist. Time to check it out. Be interesting to compare to Vox Machinae
1317051588268220416 2020-10-16 18:35:42 +0800 <XR4Work> @CathyHackl Looks like your in @vSpatialVR in the pic.
1317050736522526722 2020-10-16 18:32:19 +0800 <XR4Work> @purplemikey @oculus Yes agreed. The environment and atmosphere is incredible. Constant tension the entire time you're in the game. The visceral nature of dealing with the dead, the awareness of the clock counting down to the bell have you calculating every move. Great stuff!
1317049499576115200 2020-10-16 18:27:24 +0800 <XR4Work> @Nbec @bccasteel Thank you my friend! I'm very proud of it.
1316900712341819393 2020-10-16 08:36:11 +0800 <XR4Work> @PhaserLockInt Hey thanks for this. VR 4 Work focuses on business and professional uses of VR but I've been known to play a game of Final Assault or 2.. Or 3.  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl

1316733640403976192 2020-10-15 21:32:18 +0800 <XR4Work> @AGraylin @htcvive @2BearsStudio @vreducation @VRChat @VirBELA1 @RobinStethem @htc @drewbam @vicdeleon So maybe the launch of the Vive XR suite? looking forward to covering this at VR 4 Work.  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl I reviewed Vive Sync a few months back as well as @vreducation / Engage and @VirBELA1  but anxious to see how it all comes together
1316544988482805760 2020-10-15 09:02:40 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy It connected to Shining really well.
1316543018183389192 2020-10-15 08:54:50 +0800 <XR4Work> @ringout_victim @waywardstrategy Excellent suggestion. One of my favorites.
1316542707603582976 2020-10-15 08:53:36 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy The Shining followed by Dr Sleep.
1316531024520773633 2020-10-15 08:07:10 +0800 <XR4Work> @CathyHackl Where do I register? Don't even care what the class is.
1316524575686098946 2020-10-15 07:41:33 +0800 <XR4Work> @basvanderploeg @ImmersedVR @oculus It's really like living science fiction, isn't it?
1316487535045103617 2020-10-15 05:14:22 +0800 <XR4Work> @jerrynixon @ImmersedVR Oh yeah. Working in VR baby!
1316487050669981697 2020-10-15 05:12:26 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey @SideQuestVR wanting to verify my email but not having it arrive after multiple attempts? Hopefully it's just because the system is too busy with new users?
1316417055789375490 2020-10-15 00:34:18 +0800 <XR4Work> @bccasteel yeah and kids are creepy and scary enough all on their own 🤨😉😆

As someone with little artistic talent I greatly appreciate the skill and effort that goes into Communicating a message through an image.

1316392532251734017 2020-10-14 22:56:51 +0800 <XR4Work> okay The #Quest2  is out today and sure lots of games to play but what productivity or business use case are you also interested in exploring now?  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl
1316337280106344450 2020-10-14 19:17:18 +0800 <XR4Work> @Justin_Moving We #fast one a week now. Good for body and soul.
1316336214258192384 2020-10-14 19:13:04 +0800 <XR4Work> @Justin_Moving Your right, most of this advice is a focus on one sliver of truth ignoring the whole. Best advice is give, everything in moderation and id add with periods of self denial of everything.
1315732470004809728 2020-10-13 03:14:00 +0800 <XR4Work> @TheHappyLass @PicoInteractive @ShowcasingVr Id like to know more about its ecosystem. What platforms can you access for what kind of content.
1315699882082988034 2020-10-13 01:04:31 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey @Justin_Moving check this out...
1315682896129056768 2020-10-12 23:57:01 +0800 <XR4Work> New video posted! You see the value VR can bring to training and shared experiences. Managing users, apps, and devices can be a challenge. @Grove_xr can save you time and money enabling you to manage your Oculus devices efficiently, whether its 5 or 500!  https://t.co/ibRIBXMUrn
1315418819180064769 2020-10-12 06:27:40 +0800 <XR4Work> @hmltn @RealVRFishing Yeah that browser feature is great. As if I don't spend enough time in RVRF.
1315416469208010754 2020-10-12 06:18:20 +0800 <XR4Work> @Coercer_DoK @waywardstrategy Oh downer of a game. But games are a great medium for communicating information and history. Medal of Honor tried to integrate this. Wish more did.
1315096514528714754 2020-10-11 09:06:57 +0800 <XR4Work> @RJdoesVR I think @HP has a decent chance with the #Reverb2. But you are correct that wireless will become the most sought after requirement for future VR hmd's.
1315064129757962240 2020-10-11 06:58:15 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy What kind of game is this?
1314918056326463488 2020-10-10 21:17:49 +0800 <XR4Work> @RoblemVR @VRScout Any idea how close this is to the pc title that released in 2019?
1314892602819440640 2020-10-10 19:36:40 +0800 <XR4Work> @RinloGame @vrgamersbot @RinloGame looks gorgeous. I'm looking forward to playing this as part of my @Viveport subscription.
1314890985743278081 2020-10-10 19:30:15 +0800 <XR4Work> @Nbec @EnpassApp @oculus @ImmersedVR You r correct when using a desktop emulator your set. I'm thinking using native browsers in the Quest accessing resources there. I'm often peeking or at passwords or 2 factor.
1314889829830856705 2020-10-10 19:25:39 +0800 <XR4Work> @UploadVR I first read this as Apex Construct 2 for the Quest. Which I like better than the original headline.
1314600404060008451 2020-10-10 00:15:35 +0800 <XR4Work> @SplitverseVR @TarzanVR @LIV @FunTrainVR I am SOOOO looking forward to this!
1314554080153329669 2020-10-09 21:11:30 +0800 <XR4Work> So wondering if folks feel a password manager app like @EnpassApp would be useful within @oculus ? I know the more I do within my HMD the more I run into managing password headaches, jumping out of my headset to look them up or verify identity on my phone. Thoughts...
1314532979700621312 2020-10-09 19:47:39 +0800 <XR4Work> Ok certain #VRgame I'm close to finishing this weekend. Going to use words unique to the game to describe it. Tower, Reclaimed, Reserve, Casey. Describe what you're are playing this weekend without giving away the title. Swing away Merrill. Movie phrase added for free.
1314529166415536130 2020-10-09 19:32:30 +0800 <XR4Work> @purplemikey @This_Justintech @BigscreenVR @disneyplus Really big opportunity for @BigscreenVR I hope it helps turn them into a viable threatre alternative. Instead of let's go to the movies it will be let's put on our headsets and see what's playing in bigscreen
1314526635736141824 2020-10-09 19:22:27 +0800 <XR4Work> Umm @waywardstrategy

1313475660732493824 2020-10-06 21:46:15 +0800 <XR4Work> VR is riding a wave of adoption that's growing steadily and, at some point, will land in YOUR business.

1313080353398153217 2020-10-05 19:35:26 +0800 <XR4Work> @Tojiro I tasked about productivity using the quest in my video Quest gets Productive over on the VR 4 Work YouTube site  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl

1312894838120108035 2020-10-05 07:18:16 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey @OculusBusiness does buying into the business version negate the requirement for a Facebook account login?
1312875029860880384 2020-10-05 05:59:33 +0800 <XR4Work> @CathyHackl The positive side of the pandemic is its forced disciplines and industries forward in adapting technologies will die to be implemented. Agree here that we need to assess each student and family for what's needed to make them successful with the new tools.
1312869641837064193 2020-10-05 05:38:09 +0800 <XR4Work> Ok whoever came up with the idea in @WalkingDeadVR to send the user into a dark canning factory with several zombies is sick, just sick! Ok I feel better, let me go put myself back into a simulation of zombies and warring killers. 😉😂
1312867827964141568 2020-10-05 05:30:56 +0800 <XR4Work> @Rowdy_Guy @immersivt @Noda_Tech Hi @Rowdy_Guy I study the use of VR for work and productivity. I run a Facebook group and YouTube site dedicated to this. Glad to offer them up to you  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl let me know if I can help!
1312795694231674880 2020-10-05 00:44:18 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey @resolutiongame how are those updates to Acron coming? I've got some grandkids hyped for me new features coming.

1312759248158425091 2020-10-04 22:19:29 +0800 <XR4Work> @VR_Philosophy @DeeptownDivers @SomniumSpace I've been looking for a new platform to record my show in. I've been using Spaces but RIP. need a platform I can bring my desktop into.
1312710109919883265 2020-10-04 19:04:13 +0800 <XR4Work> @VR_Philosophy What platform are you in? Is it @SomniumSpace ?

1312707000195833856 2020-10-04 18:51:52 +0800 <XR4Work> Hi yeah I do all my VR 4 Work productions from within vr.  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl Have been using Spaces but looking for a new platform since they were bought out and stopped production.
1312527675458646017 2020-10-04 06:59:18 +0800 <XR4Work> @VRBugStream @UploadVR I've seen a few posts about this and understand the point but in regards to S&amp;S specifically, I wonder how many, like me, have it on pc already and play using VD and won't need to load it on the Quest.
1312523776727216128 2020-10-04 06:43:48 +0800 <XR4Work> @MonsterReapers @AspinDarkfire Hey I might like to try it myself!

I hope we start to see more conferences like VRAR actually do sessions using VR. perhaps in environments like @VirBELA1  or @AltspaceVR scale is a challenge but can be overcome.

1311330627879399425 2020-09-30 23:42:39 +0800 <XR4Work> yes very exciting times for VR. I think you will see the @oculus device capture consumer while @HP seems very much to be going for business and Enterprise of course Oculus does have Oculus for business where we may see some competition

1310928102067929091 2020-09-29 21:03:10 +0800 <XR4Work> Whoa @gemisisDev your REALLY taking a risk here aren't you? 🙄😉😅
1310925493257076737 2020-09-29 20:52:48 +0800 <XR4Work> Great article. Feel I understand volumetric video better after reading. Would be interesting to know what companies and platforms take advantage of it.
1310902038872625154 2020-09-29 19:19:36 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey @thevrara excited for the annual conference starting tomorrow. Are any of the precedings available in full 360 vr? I can watch in vr using @vSpatialVR or @ImmersedVR but hasn't seen availability of a shared VR conference setting like @oculus venues
1310897259421339648 2020-09-29 19:00:36 +0800 <XR4Work> @VRARASummit starts tomorrow. Follow @vr4wrk for news and info from the conference.
1310896330009718784 2020-09-29 18:56:55 +0800 <XR4Work> @HarvardBiz Working in VR provides a number of advantages, chief among them is distraction free concentration on whatever needs your focus.
1310895727137247233 2020-09-29 18:54:31 +0800 <XR4Work> If your interested in seeing how to work in VR follow @immersivt and @Vr4Wrk to stay up on the latest platforms and techniques.
1310891939890376705 2020-09-29 18:39:28 +0800 <XR4Work> Can't get here soon enough!
1310890946242936834 2020-09-29 18:35:31 +0800 <XR4Work> @CortopiaStudios @oculusquest @waywardstrategy if you ever do put the headset back on this might be a good follow.
1310685964247990272 2020-09-29 05:00:59 +0800 <XR4Work> Hot off the processor! New video posted on the VR 4 Work YouTube page. Come check out @Noda_Tech - Noda Mind-Mapping in VR. Exciting VR app that helps users create maps and plans using the power of VR .  https://t.co/Gku0LU4358
1310679028337057792 2020-09-29 04:33:26 +0800 <XR4Work> And #reverbg2 FTW!
1310673054331101184 2020-09-29 04:09:41 +0800 <XR4Work> @JoannaStern have you been following VR 4 Work?! 😉😄 Hey the more attention this gets the more it becomes socialized and accepted. Glad to see the story!
1310628063932153856 2020-09-29 01:10:55 +0800 <XR4Work> @OculusBusiness @marifes @anurag_dhingra  https://t.co/uWMActvbAe
1310606167043842048 2020-09-28 23:43:54 +0800 <XR4Work> Just that you didn't write it means its incorrect so there is that.
1310578613763207168 2020-09-28 21:54:25 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy Yep #4
1310564894840774657 2020-09-28 20:59:54 +0800 <XR4Work> Looking forward to receiving mine!
1310560037723467776 2020-09-28 20:40:36 +0800 <XR4Work> Would love to do an overview of Make Real for the VR 4 Work site! Lets connect.
1310558790287196161 2020-09-28 20:35:39 +0800 <XR4Work> Been a @Viveport subscriber for 3 years. It's an excellent value and I've seen it improving its content regularly over time. Also offers Business and Productivity apps like @Noda_Tech that we just overviewed on our YouTube page  https://t.co/piehxiH58L and of course great games!
1310536160842838017 2020-09-28 19:05:43 +0800 <XR4Work> Really enjoy listening to the commentary of these games. Feel like a learn so much about a genre that I don't get to play much.
1310394277428633605 2020-09-28 09:41:56 +0800 <XR4Work> Attention @immersivt
1310383963337359361 2020-09-28 09:00:57 +0800 <XR4Work> Just posted a video overview of @Noda_Tech shown in the image below on out YouTube  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl Really good Mind mapping Software in VR. A title you should try out!
1310377625353949184 2020-09-28 08:35:46 +0800 <XR4Work> @timhulse @Noda_Tech Hmm, that information is covered in the video. I am using a Quest myself now connecting to my PC via Virtual Desktop and running Noda via Steam. Quest version is in development.
1310305347605876738 2020-09-28 03:48:33 +0800 <XR4Work> Hot off the processor! New video posted on the VR 4 Work YouTube page. Come check out @Noda_Tech Noda Mind-Mapping in VR. Exciting VR app that helps users create maps and plans using the power of VR .  https://t.co/Gku0LU4358
1310173353982996481 2020-09-27 19:04:04 +0800 <XR4Work> @purplemikey @PhaserLockInt Yep. Was just thinking that as I read this. Love the game, but wires... Glad they're is virtual desktop!
1309880068332761088 2020-09-26 23:38:39 +0800 <XR4Work> @OculusBusiness @marifes @anurag_dhingra This recording anywhere?
1309839391704190977 2020-09-26 20:57:01 +0800 <XR4Work> Oh man so many hours in this game. Might have to load it back up to try this out. But VR has captured my mind so... . Sorry PC!
1309838206167379968 2020-09-26 20:52:18 +0800 <XR4Work> Yeah @PCGamesN and @pcgamer let's hear about this devs work on #scrapmod! He's been at it for years and refined and molded it as a labor of love.
1309836609924337664 2020-09-26 20:45:58 +0800 <XR4Work> @ASychov @SomniumSpace @ASychov looking to do an overview of @SomniumSpace for my site VR 4 WORK.  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl how about a tour and a discussion on how SS could be used for business and productivity?
1309835227192320000 2020-09-26 20:40:28 +0800 <XR4Work> Fascinating. The current state of hand tracking is fun but not exact enough for fine motor manipulation. I've always thought a tracking system like this would be required to make it truly useful.
1309834579713429508 2020-09-26 20:37:54 +0800 <XR4Work> Wow. Very cool. So excited to see XR shown in other then games and entertainment. Though just using systems like this gamify tasks and productivity.
1309818566116626437 2020-09-26 19:34:16 +0800 <XR4Work> Yes agree It's a great envornment to explore. I'm always finding something new. Have you done the Titanic museum location yet?
1309815837705076737 2020-09-26 19:23:25 +0800 <XR4Work> @spatialxr @oculus @jinha_8 Hmm very abstract and open. Presentation /conference area?
1309447072811282433 2020-09-25 18:58:05 +0800 <XR4Work> @rabovitz Seems a stretch to me to suggest they will determine ones future. Try and sell me products, sure, push content to me on the internet yes. Take away free will and choices... 🤔
1309444825230585857 2020-09-25 18:49:09 +0800 <XR4Work> @Rengle820 Priorities are right as far as I'm concerned. 🤔😅
1309444199339692034 2020-09-25 18:46:40 +0800 <XR4Work> @Rengle820 @proputtvr So great to see you guys enhance and expand an already great game. Looking forward to playing it when my Quest 2 arrives!
1309288593316294656 2020-09-25 08:28:20 +0800 <XR4Work> Gearheads had a certain depth and unique strategic quality didn't it? Or it was just quirky fun that you guys thought was funny when you were 12.
1309092429673517063 2020-09-24 19:28:51 +0800 <XR4Work> And a vive cosmos at that! Ugh.
1309091826620682242 2020-09-24 19:26:27 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy @Justin_Moving remember you guys playing a lot of hours of this. Any interest in #3?
1309074402777223175 2020-09-24 18:17:13 +0800 <XR4Work> @Tsukinune Yeah but epic!
1309072486340923393 2020-09-24 18:09:36 +0800 <XR4Work> Well I have 8 grandkids 6 old enough to play so we will certainly test them vigorously!
1309071956390621185 2020-09-24 18:07:30 +0800 <XR4Work> Nice. Is the fireworks or the window?
1308922481688932359 2020-09-24 08:13:32 +0800 <XR4Work> @SGBulletins I was expecting to hear @waywardstrategy  was coming on as a staff writer. But this is great too!
1308918667103670274 2020-09-24 07:58:23 +0800 <XR4Work> What?! Updates coming to my favorite vr multi-player game? That's great news. Many great hours work my grandkids on this. They love stealing grandpops acorns. 😅
1308414878412087298 2020-09-22 22:36:30 +0800 <XR4Work> @NathieVR I bet you get a lot of  https://t.co/UJLeDtSUIF
1308414274629496837 2020-09-22 22:34:06 +0800 <XR4Work> As I've gotten older I've become much more aware of my body and how basic things like movement matter. Message is, don't wait until your "older"!
1308358035841130497 2020-09-22 18:50:38 +0800 <XR4Work> Well worth a read in today's hectic pressure filled world.
1308354257154867200 2020-09-22 18:35:37 +0800 <XR4Work> @lloretalvar0 @XRAssociation Yes and that things are looking promising!
1308351578177507329 2020-09-22 18:24:58 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy Still not hearing of a top tier RTS VR title yet. But I'm watching out for it.
1308218399512817665 2020-09-22 09:35:46 +0800 <XR4Work> Just picked up a Wayward Strate-Tee on @Bonfire  https://t.co/u3sEJaC9JS
1308213980255707142 2020-09-22 09:18:12 +0800 <XR4Work> @UploadVR I work several hours a week in vr now. I use @ImmersedVR and @vSpatialVR @spatialxr and @vreducation depending on need. Use a good bit of voice rec for input. Some processes requiring a lot of detailed fine motor arent suited for it. Email, vid cons, web browsing, docs r fine
1308146985384292352 2020-09-22 04:52:00 +0800 <XR4Work> @ID_AA_Carmack Which ones would you want to see bring into #VR?
1308146794761650176 2020-09-22 04:51:14 +0800 <XR4Work> @anshelsag @ZeniMax_Online @Microsoft @ID_AA_Carmack And bring them into #VR!
1308146031121424384 2020-09-22 04:48:12 +0800 <XR4Work> @TelecomTV @citrix This will also be a big driver of use of an alternative end user tool set like a #VR HMD vs laptop moving forward.
1308137465111220225 2020-09-22 04:14:10 +0800 <XR4Work> @EdTechMedic @juliesmithso @VirBELA1 @immersiveLRN Had just covered @VirBELA1 at the VR 4 Work YouTube page. A really great platform. I would readily recommend and use it. Hoping to see them expand the VR capability.  https://t.co/piehxiH58L
1308129148632612864 2020-09-22 03:41:07 +0800 <XR4Work> @VRDesktop This could be big. I say could as I'm not a developer but i know on the business and education side being able to bring in some of the outside world would be really useful as shown in the infinite office demo.
1308128298640093184 2020-09-22 03:37:44 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy I haven't pulled the trigger yet. Wanted to check my size. Order incoming.
1308001685810425856 2020-09-21 19:14:38 +0800 <XR4Work> @RickKing16 Had a 2 hour meeting in @spatialxr last night. The other party was in Sweden and I on the east coast of the US. But we were still in the same room for those two hours. Amazing.
1307989328895725571 2020-09-21 18:25:31 +0800 <XR4Work> @ForbesTech @CharlieFink Used Loomie originally worth the now defunct Spaces. Now that it's gone, using it in @vSpatialVR for my video conferences. Works great and a lot of fun.
1307629937390751751 2020-09-20 18:37:26 +0800 <XR4Work> @SkarredGhost Hoping for the same for text in other apps so tasks like reading email and documents become easier on the eyes and more natural.
1307629316323278848 2020-09-20 18:34:58 +0800 <XR4Work> @HarvardBiz Studies have shown that learning in #VR i helps retention and comprehension as time user is actually engaged with the content and distraction free.
1307462919681118210 2020-09-20 07:33:46 +0800 <XR4Work> @tomemrich For a moment I had a flashback to windows tiles!
1307457801296453638 2020-09-20 07:13:25 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey @OculusBusiness how come after filling out the business contact form there is no communication, no acknowledgement of receipt of the form? Something to consider.
1307267393463427072 2020-09-19 18:36:49 +0800 <XR4Work> @dr_oculus Yep. Ordered Quest 2 and elite strap with battery. Wondering if like Q1 the facial interface will need replaced also with a 3rd party
1307033280622067713 2020-09-19 03:06:32 +0800 <XR4Work> @SimonKarlskov @gemisisDev yeah this keyboard is several years old. I've had mine at least 3 years
1307033095271571456 2020-09-19 03:05:48 +0800 <XR4Work> @purplemikey @gemisisDev just got mine Out and paired it successfully using Bluetooth to my Oculus Quest 1
1307015386278264838 2020-09-19 01:55:25 +0800 <XR4Work> @drsallans Cannot wait to get my Sam Fischer on!
1307013878883258368 2020-09-19 01:49:26 +0800 <XR4Work> Ok this will be really handy. Gets rid of a barrier in making this happen.
1307013299347902464 2020-09-19 01:47:08 +0800 <XR4Work> @This_Justintech  https://t.co/344oTCjEkp
1307012858828521473 2020-09-19 01:45:23 +0800 <XR4Work> @anshelsag @Heaney555 @oculus @Justin_Moving should look into doing a series on this.
1307012541583962118 2020-09-19 01:44:07 +0800 <XR4Work> Wait registration has reopened?!
1307012254517297154 2020-09-19 01:42:59 +0800 <XR4Work> @purplemikey Yeah I had thought the same but @FacebookHorizon seems to have a different purpose. More for creating and sharing small scale where Venues seem to be what they are leveraging for larger events? I end with a question mark!
1307011404738760710 2020-09-19 01:39:36 +0800 <XR4Work> Everyone these days can be entrepreneurial. Take your passion and show its value. The platforms to do that are right in your hands.
1306976033493733376 2020-09-18 23:19:03 +0800 <XR4Work> @gemisisDev OMG I didn't pay it close enough attention and just looked at the model number and realized I have one of these!
1306969102225817602 2020-09-18 22:51:30 +0800 <XR4Work> @Justin_Moving @DOYOUYOGA I think I'll pass.
1306966787322515458 2020-09-18 22:42:19 +0800 <XR4Work> @prvncher Today?
1306966240636928001 2020-09-18 22:40:08 +0800 <XR4Work> @gemisisDev WOW that's really cool. Did you get it as a beta tester? I'd love to get my hands on one of these.
1306965196146171909 2020-09-18 22:35:59 +0800 <XR4Work> WHOO HOOO! when do i get my prize?
1306916239168565248 2020-09-18 19:21:27 +0800 <XR4Work> @OXIOXIForever @hmltn Yeah HTC seems to have lost our have up the VR hardware wars when they had the lead. They may be pivoting to software now launching their Vive XR Suite product later this year.
1306915578326790149 2020-09-18 19:18:49 +0800 <XR4Work> @Nbec @RenjiBijoy @anchorice @ImmersedVR @oculus Oh yeah man. My jaw dropped a little as I did a video on the YouTube channel called Quest gets Productive a few months ago that shows some similar concepts.
1306914502332514306 2020-09-18 19:14:33 +0800 <XR4Work> You are too kind sir! Hey @oculus @OculusBusiness over here, hello, right this way...
1306914120625795078 2020-09-18 19:13:02 +0800 <XR4Work> Hmmm I don't see Steam VR mentioned?
1306913517463908353 2020-09-18 19:10:38 +0800 <XR4Work> I can do this in VR.
1306913267084861441 2020-09-18 19:09:38 +0800 <XR4Work> @purplemikey @OculusGaming Yes excellent idea. They need to start building us some tools so we can do more things in VR so we don't have to go out then in to accomplish tasks.
1306756189259268096 2020-09-18 08:45:28 +0800 <XR4Work> @OXIOXIForever @hmltn Why would you think we haven't seen something like this yet?
1306748096341307399 2020-09-18 08:13:19 +0800 <XR4Work> Helping business see how this can help with productivity, education and training and collaboration and ultimately the bottom line presents a great challenge and opportunity.
1306746370016120832 2020-09-18 08:06:27 +0800 <XR4Work> @OXIOXIForever @hmltn They showed a special Logitech keyboard being used.
1306745415589597187 2020-09-18 08:02:39 +0800 <XR4Work> @bccasteel But what alternatives during these times?
1306743396296536064 2020-09-18 07:54:38 +0800 <XR4Work> @Nbec @RenjiBijoy @anchorice Hi Nick I work in @ImmersedVR 10-15 hours a week. I've moved to using voice rec for most of my input. Of course it matters what type of work you do. I'm mostly doing email, documents, signing off and video conference meetings. Check my YouTube  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl for info
1306739880458846213 2020-09-18 07:40:40 +0800 <XR4Work> Alexa start breakfast? 🤔😅
1306689892060143619 2020-09-18 04:22:02 +0800 <XR4Work> One of my classic favorites. I played @PlayOverload when it came out and it nailed bringing it into the modern era.
1306688951550382081 2020-09-18 04:18:17 +0800 <XR4Work> @Justin_Moving Yep it's time. Getting the sweaters out.
1306687708203450368 2020-09-18 04:13:21 +0800 <XR4Work> The future is today!
1306551412046925827 2020-09-17 19:11:45 +0800 <XR4Work> @PolyarcGames @oculus @OculusGaming OK @waywardstrategy and @Justin_Moving #SweepstakesEntry your chance to get in on the future baby! Jump in on this.
1306311531508961281 2020-09-17 03:18:33 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey saw Resolve @InsiteVR highlighted in a video clip during the #FacebookConnect presentation today! I just did an overview of this on the YouTube page a few weeks ago. Is Zuck watching maybe?
1306309837534441474 2020-09-17 03:11:49 +0800 <XR4Work> @TheeBeardedBard Following...but that's my guess also.

1306264904492605441 2020-09-17 00:13:17 +0800 <XR4Work> @Justin_Moving @waywardstrategy I've got some vr games you need to try. Sword and sorcery in vr.
1306264591983407106 2020-09-17 00:12:02 +0800 <XR4Work> @RealityRendered  https://t.co/xlCccRX197

1306262650859515910 2020-09-17 00:04:19 +0800 <XR4Work> @TheeBeardedBard Been checking the Oculus site regularly just to see if they try and seek an offer page in!  https://t.co/wvxl5ZZfhg
1306261778918240256 2020-09-17 00:00:51 +0800 <XR4Work> @Justin_Moving Medal of Honor. Just the best series of games ever! Just don't tell @waywardstrategy i said that! 👀
1306261462915207171 2020-09-16 23:59:36 +0800 <XR4Work> @GAMERTAGVR  https://t.co/CAstkKGUpx
1306261055556005894 2020-09-16 23:57:59 +0800 <XR4Work> @Justin_Moving you should follow
1306260682946510849 2020-09-16 23:56:30 +0800 <XR4Work> @Justin_Moving Though the idea of Just Moves also comes to mind. Just being a play on Justin as well as just as in the definition “what is right, exact, simply“.
1306258736617578496 2020-09-16 23:48:46 +0800 <XR4Work> @Wilberstien  https://t.co/nuvttKiZcr
1306257792869838858 2020-09-16 23:45:01 +0800 <XR4Work> @purplemikey Would be so jazzed for a vr Splinter cell! Get my Sam Fischer on!  https://t.co/Fsf0U1mvqN
1306257292191502336 2020-09-16 23:43:02 +0800 <XR4Work> @VRchazen  https://t.co/HN8H1VJCfs
1306014490690027523 2020-09-16 07:38:13 +0800 <XR4Work> I WANT MOH but guess Pop 1.
1306012584202694656 2020-09-16 07:30:39 +0800 <XR4Work> Playstation. Hope it comes to PC VR some day. Waiting for the right RTS to lure you in...
1305873088802848770 2020-09-15 22:16:20 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy Does it say "wayward strategy"?
1305872547574153217 2020-09-15 22:14:11 +0800 <XR4Work> @MrCatid Yes very excited to see the advantages and gains in using Quest 2 as a productivity tool.
1305689570391011328 2020-09-15 10:07:06 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy Sign me up!
1305208754145824776 2020-09-14 02:16:31 +0800 <XR4Work> @DrBeef Outstanding! Any estimated time frame to look for?
1305208069807370241 2020-09-14 02:13:48 +0800 <XR4Work> This looks awesome! Would be a great multiplayer title. How is being considered for release and not just experimental.
1305139629465702406 2020-09-13 21:41:50 +0800 <XR4Work> Fellow mug collector here. Let us know where you got them.
1305139390197440513 2020-09-13 21:40:53 +0800 <XR4Work> @DrBeef Can't you already do this via virtual desktop? 🤔 So this will be a native release?
1304874878085009415 2020-09-13 04:09:48 +0800 <XR4Work> So what does this mean?
1304481650651340800 2020-09-12 02:07:16 +0800 <XR4Work> @waywardstrategy  https://t.co/Ro4MUifQgl
1304191517066747908 2020-09-11 06:54:23 +0800 <XR4Work> I'm Rick and I'm work in IT and am a VR enthusiast who started a site called VR 4 Work to explore how spatial computing will change how we work in the very near future.
1304190852059758595 2020-09-11 06:51:44 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey Twitterverse and VR fans would appreciate you checking out my site VR 4 Work  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl and if you think it's worthy, a follow and a retweet. Just shy of 100 here and 200 on YouTube. I know, just numbers. Thanks!
1304095120644546560 2020-09-11 00:31:20 +0800 <XR4Work> @ID_AA_Carmack Your thoughts on VR and productivity and the vision of being able to work within a HMD. What's needed to see an HMD become a daily choice to work from.
1304094201303498752 2020-09-11 00:27:41 +0800 <XR4Work> @Justin_Moving Takes a little practice but just do your stuff and focus on that. The rest is background noise.
1304092596856291330 2020-09-11 00:21:18 +0800 <XR4Work> @RtoVR It would be interesting to see because HTC hasn't been hitting any home runs lately with hardware (Cosmos) and the current Focus plus is only 2 cameras and not fun.
1304091431527690243 2020-09-11 00:16:40 +0800 <XR4Work> I wonder what impact training in immersive technologies #VR would have on these numbers. I would expect an improvement but of course you need further studies.
1303888612954693632 2020-09-10 10:50:45 +0800 <XR4Work> Wow #RaisedByWolves on @hbomax is outstanding. Great sci-fi, deep symbolism. Best thing I've watched all year.
1303799479628431365 2020-09-10 04:56:34 +0800 <XR4Work> I hope I'm not saying the same about my @HP #Reverb2 in a year 😳
1303664343498850304 2020-09-09 19:59:35 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey @waywardstrategy don't you wish you had someone to play this with? 🤔Who could that be...
1303663426162565122 2020-09-09 19:55:56 +0800 <XR4Work> @TarzanVR Wow Tarzan is a real old school action hero and I'm and old school action dude so sign me up! Actually I'll sign myself up at the link included.
1303662487372472322 2020-09-09 19:52:12 +0800 <XR4Work> Hi everyone! New video up on the VR 4 Work YouTube site. We overview an AEC VR app from the group @InsiteVR. Resolve allows users to review BIM files within vr from within your quest. Don't know AEC or BIM? check the video!  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl
1302949461128171520 2020-09-07 20:38:53 +0800 <XR4Work> Last day to sign up for  https://t.co/Ej3XPeEqRR to benefit Doctors Without Borders. Play a few rounds of VR Golf and help to support a great cause. Hope to see you on the virtual links!
1302695527923015682 2020-09-07 03:49:51 +0800 <XR4Work> Whoa 😳
1302695055258460160 2020-09-07 03:47:58 +0800 <XR4Work> @Noda_Tech played with Noda on @Viveport today. Was very interested in chatting about your plans for development. are you planning to launch on the @oculus Quest?
1302693976416440322 2020-09-07 03:43:41 +0800 <XR4Work> Have been frustrated for weeks not being able to share my hybrid gpu laptop screen in @vreducation Engage. Today a breakthrough! Add a headless display and bingo! Problem solved. Thanks  @TonyTrudel for being my Engege guide and @RenjiBijoy for the headless display info.
1302690470687055874 2020-09-07 03:29:45 +0800 <XR4Work> My father in law used to say good looks and a quarter will get you a cup of coffee.
1302584270691721216 2020-09-06 20:27:45 +0800 <XR4Work> That the one from Manova?
1302583204541542400 2020-09-06 20:23:31 +0800 <XR4Work> @bmfshow Hey @bmfshow what would you think about getting a group to participate in  https://t.co/Ej3XPeW2gr. Great cause and users VR to accomplish it. Id love talking more about perhaps helping coordinate a quarterly event like this for charity giving. Maybe get some sponsors.
1302283876753080320 2020-09-06 00:34:06 +0800 <XR4Work> Yes! I knew it!
1302283244495405056 2020-09-06 00:31:35 +0800 <XR4Work> Always looking for new AR VR casts to check out. Glad I came across this.
1302282755703799809 2020-09-06 00:29:38 +0800 <XR4Work> @purplemikey Checking out the updates to @ImmersedVR , @spatialxr and also learning more about @InsiteVR Resolve product and @LearnBrite. Hopefully all will turn into material for the VR 4 Work Facebook and YouTube sites.  https://t.co/piehxiYGxl
1302043235041374210 2020-09-05 08:37:52 +0800 <XR4Work> @audible_com Sandman
1302040195240529921 2020-09-05 08:25:47 +0800 <XR4Work> @alexmakesvr Exactly! I started VR 4 Work   https://t.co/piehxiYGxl as a hobby but feel that experience adds up and becomes more and more valuable over time. And I get to meet great people and contacts along the way. Winning! 😂
1302038892401635328 2020-09-05 08:20:37 +0800 <XR4Work> Wooo hooo noice!
1302020501120966659 2020-09-05 07:07:32 +0800 <XR4Work> @AcadicusX, a platform we covered on the VR 4 Work YouTube a month or so back, just teased access to their content via a smart phone. Would make for a powerful content consumption platform. Practice in VR and review on your phone.  https://t.co/9GlgbWdW5m
1301477283690090496 2020-09-03 19:08:59 +0800 <XR4Work> @bmfshow With all the features you mention? Cost wouldn't matter... Much.
1301476151987064832 2020-09-03 19:04:29 +0800 <XR4Work> Hey I recognize this room from @vreducation Engage.
1300858755685515264 2020-09-02 02:11:10 +0800 <XR4Work> @TheJinXR @vSpatialVR Ok you got my interest! Eager to see what you got.
