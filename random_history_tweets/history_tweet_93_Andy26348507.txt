How is he qualified to know? Is he a prophet? Oh, I forgot, it has everything to do with control and nothing to do with any virus.

Try it. The masks actually rely on air being able to get around the edges, or people would pass out in them.

They are enforced on businesses, who can be fined or shut down if they allow anyone in without one. All Florida has done is to prevent individuals from being fined, which means very little.
1336770656076255237 2020-12-10 04:32:15 +0800 <Andy26348507> @AnthonySabatini OSHA's own very strict regulations controlling the use of face masks, should be prohibiting employees of virtually all businesses from being forced to wear them. But since COVID they've gone strangely silent on this and stopped enforcing their own rules.

1336117031129804800 2020-12-08 09:14:58 +0800 <Andy26348507> @AlexBerenson Masks are for bank robbers, bandits and cult rituals. They are sinister. Forcing healthy people to engage in this occult practice, is either a forced religious observance or a forced medical intervention, and either is unconscionable in a free country.

1331605785168719874 2020-11-25 22:28:53 +0800 <Andy26348507> @AnthonySabatini And put a state-level ban on freedom-violating mask mandates still being imposed by counties and cities in Florida. No business should be able to refuse entry to someone unable or unwilling to wear a device that impairs breathing, any more than they can for any other disability.
1331438282203406337 2020-11-25 11:23:18 +0800 <Andy26348507> @michaeljknowles According to polls, it's more than half the country as many democrats also believe there was fraud.

Yes he ended any fines for individuals, but businesses still required to enforce them in many counties at penalty of being fined or shut down.
1330992280870772736 2020-11-24 05:51:03 +0800 <Andy26348507> @AlexBerenson This also assumes most exhaled air is forced through the mask. The reality is that most exhaled air finds a way AROUND the mask (the path of least resistance), by forcing open a gap (or taking advantage of any existing gap) between mask and face.
1330907947405373441 2020-11-24 00:15:56 +0800 <Andy26348507> @AnthonySabatini How about also a bill that says places of public accommodation cannot force people to wear face coverings against their will, or discriminate against those who don't consent?

Whether they work or not, being forced to wear them to engage in commerce is an infringement on our civil liberties.

1315773838421041154 2020-10-13 05:58:23 +0800 <Andy26348507> Agree.  They ought to have this saturating all the TV channels also.

They are just fragments of DNA or RNA. You are imputing an conscious ability "to survive" to something that possesses no such thing.

1311898165986107392 2020-10-02 13:17:51 +0800 <Andy26348507> @Breaking911 Stop pushing such patently false narratives - in this case plainly and irritatingly false - and perhaps we'll stop blaming the media.

One side values their freedoms and civil liberties and sees mandated facial covering as Sharia-Law-like tyranny, while the other side seems to yearn for such tyranny. Should have only ever been a recommendation.

1311393399115833344 2020-10-01 03:52:05 +0800 <Andy26348507> @ACTBrigitte For that we can be thankful, but Trump could have done so much better. He was woefully unprepared for the most predictable, and predictably-biased, questions and challenges from that disgrace of a moderator.
1311390984341774339 2020-10-01 03:42:29 +0800 <Andy26348507> @TwatterMcGee @JoanneMesti @SimulationComm3 @AlexBerenson You guys summed up my thoughts perfectly. Trump was, frustratingly, woefully unprepared for the most predictable of questions and insinuations.
1311386398071586819 2020-10-01 03:24:16 +0800 <Andy26348507> @RJNewsflash Honestly difficult to say, in terms of debate performance.  I'm a solid Trump supporter but Trump seemed woefully unprepared for the predictable questions from Wallace and too defensive.  He could have destroyed Biden with a single well-prepared question or challenge, but didn't.
1310725664451031044 2020-09-29 07:38:45 +0800 <Andy26348507> @MrsLevi2 @Drestradamus That's not entirely true. The Florida counties and cities that are run by power-hungry busy-bodies are still forcing every place of business to require face muzzles, in spite of our governor's attempts to bring normalcy and commerce back to our state.
1310615627208568832 2020-09-29 00:21:30 +0800 <Andy26348507> @ScottSevel @RoseStrobel1 @GovRonDeSantis Not the same thing. They are in a controlled air pressure environment, and monitored for health concerns relating to masking per OSHA regulations. Even then, many doctors find it exhausting.
1310450340463104000 2020-09-28 13:24:42 +0800 <Andy26348507> @Yanky_Pollak Agree, except all cops need to go back to being clean-shaven.  Allowing cops to grow beards was a terrible decision ... just comes across as a slackening of standards and doesn't portray a professional image.
1310269243410309124 2020-09-28 01:25:05 +0800 <Andy26348507> @catturd2 I've seriously never heard of him. Is he supposed to be someone important?

1309938349646508034 2020-09-27 03:30:14 +0800 <Andy26348507> @Richardfl99 @drdavidsamadi No, many leftist-controlled counties are still fighting DeSantis's orders in every way they can if they think the order gives them a loophole.
1309937128286060544 2020-09-27 03:25:23 +0800 <Andy26348507> @AnthonySabatini @OCFLMayor @orlandomayor Broward County still saying people cannot sit or be served at bars, essentially contradicting DeSantis's declaration that bars can open everywhere. Also still requiring mandatory face muzzles in all businesses.  DeSantis needs to override this more forcefully.
1309602334394191873 2020-09-26 05:15:02 +0800 <Andy26348507> @1118dext @theblaze Not true.  Tyrannical mask mandates here also, depending on the county.  Some of our counties have the most overbearing mandates anywhere in the country, actually.

1307185926339211267 2020-09-19 13:13:05 +0800 <Andy26348507> @henryrodgersdc So many brainwashed MSM-followers are expressing surprise and saying this is the first time they've seen this side of President Trump. Yet anybody who's really been following him intensely for the past 3 yrs would know this is very much the authentic Donald Trump.
1307181680734732290 2020-09-19 12:56:13 +0800 <Andy26348507> @Judith_Nugget @henryrodgersdc If you'd watched his rally, you'd know the breaking news never reached him. From the topics he touched upon, it was profoundly clear he was totally unaware. No time for him to be "carefully schooled."  This literally happened as he walked off the stage.  You are plain wrong.
1307177991986909186 2020-09-19 12:41:34 +0800 <Andy26348507> @Obidecoque @henryrodgersdc Then you haven't been watching him very much over the past 3 years, beyond what the Marxist Media allows you to see.
1307177421003685889 2020-09-19 12:39:18 +0800 <Andy26348507> @mattbots @Zangie @henryrodgersdc @declanpgarvey Then you don't know Donald Trump at all, and clearly have not spent any serious time observing the man over the past 3 years, beyond the filter of the brainwashing Marxist Media.
1306703204240027649 2020-09-18 05:14:55 +0800 <Andy26348507> @GrahamLedger Yeah, well don't give Barr too much credit.  He and the DoJ needed to be declaring this months ago.  Too much damage has already been done at this point.  Too many livelihoods that will never recover. How could this statement take 6 months to come out of his lips?
1306701395475804166 2020-09-18 05:07:44 +0800 <Andy26348507> @PamelaGeller And it took him 6 months to utter these words? After incalculable destruction has been wrought on countless hundreds of thousands of livelihoods.  This kind of statement was needed from the DoJ months ago.
1306445156044935170 2020-09-17 12:09:32 +0800 <Andy26348507> @unseen1_unseen He ultimately caved on #12 though. Thousands of lives could have been saved had he stuck to his guns on HCQ. Should have also been much more forceful in ending shutdowns sooner, and advocating for citizens' constitutional rights to earn a living, assemble, not be muzzled, etc.

Your lack of perspective is what's outrageous.  Should have been given one warning to move, then plowed down with a heavy vehicle.
1305029408487616512 2020-09-13 14:23:51 +0800 <Andy26348507> @AnthonySabatini Fauci disgusts me with this kind of remark.  FIRE FAUCI is an understatement.  This kind of irresponsible and ill-informed rhetoric will irreparably destroy our way of life or any hope of recovery, if he's not brought to heel and publicly denounced.

In fact it's seeming like most of the deaths were due to "genocide by ventilator" and disastrous medical practices.
1303219652609409025 2020-09-08 14:32:32 +0800 <Andy26348507> @rcs180 @AlexBerenson Maybe they used Hydroxychloroquine.

1303037561544290307 2020-09-08 02:28:58 +0800 <Andy26348507> @rising_serpent They'll be conflating and labeling flu cases as a resurgence of COVID, guaranteed.
1303036954183979008 2020-09-08 02:26:33 +0800 <Andy26348507> @RichardGrenell Agree, Twitter is brazenly showing they support the lawlessness and insurrection that is taking place. Everyone needs to retweet the image of this tweet.
1302838466301120512 2020-09-07 13:17:50 +0800 <Andy26348507> @GOPChairwoman @LindaSuhler This may be the only thing I'll ever agree with Biden/Harris on, but on this they are correct (even though their motives are only political). Nobody should trust a rushed vaccine.  Trump himself was anti-vaxx and pro-HCQ but has worryingly caved to Big Pharma.

1302495535794999296 2020-09-06 14:35:09 +0800 <Andy26348507> @DonaldJTrumpJr Wasn't Antifa designated a terrorist organization? Doesn't the US Government normally move heaven and earth to locate and take out terrorists? Why are they being allowed to openly parade themselves down the street and not be immediately apprehended or even met with deadly force?

(Pre-COVID) they wore them for the minimum time necessary (i.e. while performing actual surgery), and often felt exhausted afterwards. Though strangely silent since COVID, OSHA deemed masks harmful/disallowed in most workplaces without special protocols.
1302125409534988288 2020-09-05 14:04:24 +0800 <Andy26348507> @charliekirk11 And their Sharia Law mandates regarding face coverings.  Otherwise businesses won't be patronized by self-respecting persons, even with lock-downs lifted.
1301932183830102016 2020-09-05 01:16:36 +0800 <Andy26348507> This should be retweeted by everyone who wants to see this lock-down scam ended.  It's one of the most revealing, most-needed and most common-sense articles I've seen.

Others have also suggested this, and it's very credible IMO. It's absurd that we still don't really know how this transmits by now.
