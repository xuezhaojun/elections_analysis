1329151412966617088 2020-11-19 03:56:05 +0800 <Artemis2030> @YardleyShooting The intention to ban cars was planned back in 1992 in a document Agenda 21 Sustainable Development signed and agreed on by 178 Nations. Nothing new.

1328676047081017345 2020-11-17 20:27:09 +0800 <Artemis2030> @CovidAre I remember when I had the flu prior to COVID19. My doctor gave me three day medical certificate to stay home from work and advise me to get rest and drink water. That's all! Now you can't walk into a medical clinic if you have flu like systems. Talk about overreaction.
1328655885686587392 2020-11-17 19:07:03 +0800 <Artemis2030> @TheCoronaCure_ I never watch television so I'm not worried about getting COVID19.
1328654948389638146 2020-11-17 19:03:19 +0800 <Artemis2030> @TheCoronaCure_ @AeHcat Funny. But true üòÅ
1328653571231862785 2020-11-17 18:57:51 +0800 <Artemis2030> @woodsharp The virus is very smart and it knows to attack you while getting a haircut but will leave you alone if your painting the road ü§®üôÑ
1328649819838062592 2020-11-17 18:42:56 +0800 <Artemis2030> @DarrenPlymouth In the Bible Jesus indicated the world would go through a time of unprecedented terror, never previously seen in history. The Great Reset is the beginning of  7 yrs under the reign of Anti-Christ, called the Beast, no one will be able to buy or sell unless they receive the mark.
1328646827621507081 2020-11-17 18:31:03 +0800 <Artemis2030> @smiffytheforce @simondolan Message comes from the NWO. The Bible indicates that there will be a future one world government that will introduce a one world identification system. Satan has a goal of globalism which will be achieved with the coming rule of the Anti-Christ.
1328643628311269376 2020-11-17 18:18:20 +0800 <Artemis2030> @AeHcat @harwood_su With the amount of donations BigPharma and Bill Gates gives to MSM we will be hearing alot more positive news about them in MSM ü§®
1328639234169704448 2020-11-17 18:00:53 +0800 <Artemis2030> @YardleyShooting COVID19 has been around since 2014 and now they have decided to capitalise on it.
1328638725669101568 2020-11-17 17:58:51 +0800 <Artemis2030> @rob_miller12345 @AeHcat We are going back to the Victorian era. The Rich were extremely rich and the poor couldn't afford to buy food to feed their family.
1328636642396041219 2020-11-17 17:50:35 +0800 <Artemis2030> @bruce_bwkm I've done heaps of British things. Watching television show Neighbours. I once ate scones with jam and cream for breakfast and a cup of tea. I ate hot chips wrapped Newspaper. I used to think the Royal Family were lovely people ü§®
1328632866134056960 2020-11-17 17:35:34 +0800 <Artemis2030> @Teqmock When did the Royal Family Care about the people ü§®. Supporting Charities owned by their friends and photo opportunities with starving children isn't caring! The Royal Family are a joke.
1328631150298820609 2020-11-17 17:28:45 +0800 <Artemis2030> @riseupmelbourne It is disgusting that the Australian Government uses faulty testing to produce  false positive COVID19 cases to justify lockdowns and boarder closures üò° And now they pay Australians to prolong the COVID19 BS! üò†
1328625885772095495 2020-11-17 17:07:50 +0800 <Artemis2030> @JC_free82 I agree
1328613417561714688 2020-11-17 16:18:17 +0800 <Artemis2030> @Walkabout24 Funny. But we are heading that way.
1328610502604247040 2020-11-17 16:06:42 +0800 <Artemis2030> @MattHancock Matt Hancock where are the piles of dead bodies lining the streets because of COVID19? Which you claim is the reason why families can't spend Christmas together! Where is the army to help undertakers &amp; funeral homes to collect &amp; dispose of bodies? Stop your lying. SHAME ON YOU!!!
1328605646460215298 2020-11-17 15:47:25 +0800 <Artemis2030> @Formylifeandyou @Rhonda52807071 This is just the beginning of a 7 years Antichrist takeover according to the bible and Western Astrology planetary allinment.
1328602085148028930 2020-11-17 15:33:15 +0800 <Artemis2030> @riseupmelbourne Alot of people are quietly aware but not very vocal out of fear of being labelled a conspiracy theorist or worse end up on government watch list.
1328601410003476482 2020-11-17 15:30:35 +0800 <Artemis2030> @riseupmelbourne Yes. Obesity has been the stand out with COVID19 death. This will be the globalist elite next step in the name of safety, sustainability and saving the planet. They will soon be monitoring  &amp; restricting our food intake and what we buy. The plan is already in progress.
1328599394845945858 2020-11-17 15:22:34 +0800 <Artemis2030> @TruthWinsOut20 It's a smart virus ü§®
1328598974459244544 2020-11-17 15:20:54 +0800 <Artemis2030> @talkRADIO Isn't Biden and this friends  MSM doing exactly the same thing??? Claiming victory before the winner can be officially announced!
1328598361126170625 2020-11-17 15:18:28 +0800 <Artemis2030> @DC_Draino Fauci should be in prison!
1328598163184381953 2020-11-17 15:17:40 +0800 <Artemis2030> @riseupmelbourne This is why we will never get back to normal. Majority of people are stupid ü§°
1328597833902067712 2020-11-17 15:16:22 +0800 <Artemis2030> @riseupmelbourne That's disgusting. Shame on you Myer! Not shopping at Myers anymore üò°
1328483328748503040 2020-11-17 07:41:22 +0800 <Artemis2030> @nodealfornature That has always been United Nations Agenda 21 plan since 1992. Prevent citizens from accessing Parklands and forest under the guise of saving the planet.
1328481866823811072 2020-11-17 07:35:33 +0800 <Artemis2030> @courtlynn30 Zero. That's how scared I am of COVID19.
1328480851923910657 2020-11-17 07:31:31 +0800 <Artemis2030> @DC_Draino Why is America divided into Republicans versus the Democrats? 'A House Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand'. Americans needs to unite. Fight together against United Nations Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030, Great Reset, Building Back Better, The New Normal, and Lockdowns are the enemy.
1328456354005041152 2020-11-17 05:54:10 +0800 <Artemis2030> @riseupmelbourne I saw it posted and even a link on Facebook I will search for it and post.
1328455872738070529 2020-11-17 05:52:16 +0800 <Artemis2030> @riseupmelbourne Fauci did a report on the Spanish flu and admitted that face masks caused majority of the deaths not the Spanish flu itself.
1328361630170693634 2020-11-16 23:37:47 +0800 <Artemis2030> @Dee_loot That's not the reality of COVID19. That reality only exists on television NOT in real life.
1328246107739045898 2020-11-16 15:58:44 +0800 <Artemis2030> @LockdownLazarus Test it on the food in your fridge or your pets or plants in your backyard. I'm sure they will all test positive.
1328242605998497792 2020-11-16 15:44:49 +0800 <Artemis2030> @lorrain00414525 I go with corrupt.
1328242178234089472 2020-11-16 15:43:07 +0800 <Artemis2030> @conspiracyb0t I never had the flu shot in my life until 2020 when the Queensland Australia Government forced health care workers to get a flu shot or don't return to work üò°

1328238533090320384 2020-11-16 15:28:38 +0800 <Artemis2030> @EsotericExposal Might explain why the Vatican is decorated in Satanic symbols.
1328236968791007232 2020-11-16 15:22:25 +0800 <Artemis2030> @YardleyShooting @BBC I stopped watching television. It's a waste of time.

1328233150435061761 2020-11-16 15:07:15 +0800 <Artemis2030> @YardleyShooting @BBC Just look at who owns the media.
1328232371343159298 2020-11-16 15:04:09 +0800 <Artemis2030> @quot3bot @EsotericExposal Stephen Hawking was an idiot for claiming God didn't exist.
1328229809206435841 2020-11-16 14:53:58 +0800 <Artemis2030> @JanSummersalt They didn't need to. Apparently votes got counted in China.
1328223859850440706 2020-11-16 14:30:20 +0800 <Artemis2030> @Roydini25 Good luck getting factual information from the government.
1328223357792251904 2020-11-16 14:28:20 +0800 <Artemis2030> @tnewtondunn We know where this is going. It's part of the sustainability initiatives planned along time ago. It will involve government monitoring our eating and controlling our consumption. Coming Soon to a town near you thank you NWO üôÑ

1328211531855642624 2020-11-16 13:41:20 +0800 <Artemis2030> @Dee_loot Tax who if nobody is working? Think again!
1328211355028004866 2020-11-16 13:40:38 +0800 <Artemis2030> @Dee_loot Do are you suggesting America gets into more debt?
1328209958278598656 2020-11-16 13:35:05 +0800 <Artemis2030> @Dee_loot And where do you think the state gets its money?
1328200626732367873 2020-11-16 12:58:00 +0800 <Artemis2030> @Dee_loot If you close businesses and destroy the economy who will pay for hospitals to continue working?
