1342093204741644290 2020-12-24 21:02:09 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @Saffello96 The nhs sites are fine to start study it‚Äôs the uni who stopped us
1342092630071660546 2020-12-24 20:59:52 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @Saffello96 We have all protocols and PPE in place too but still not allowed. Good to know you guys are so I can think about this.
1342079707471355904 2020-12-24 20:08:31 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @Saffello96 Interesting our uni does not allow us to go back as no mixing of household allowed and they don‚Äôt want to risk contamination.
1342068876604014594 2020-12-24 19:25:29 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @Saffello96 Lovely gesture! We sent cards to all our participants too. Are you guys back in the wards and testing?
1342068632587804672 2020-12-24 19:24:31 +0800 <StephanieRossit> Merry Christmas :)  https://t.co/4pbqz5lap3

1339685299711070213 2020-12-18 05:34:00 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @bgkuhlmann Great idea
1339588389020946433 2020-12-17 23:08:54 +0800 <StephanieRossit> Really excited that @action_brain will be joining us at our spring meeting. Look forward to the keynote!
1339303093805199369 2020-12-17 04:15:15 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @LorinaNaci thank you @LorinaNaci (that is very kind of you) and good luck for you.
1339212065987309568 2020-12-16 22:13:32 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @gemma_learmonth @DrGBuckingham @ag_mitchell they did give me an engagement achievement award I guess. My impact is also not good enough even though 60  national and international clinicians are now registered users of sight -  https://t.co/uq0bDHFWgm
1339203267306401792 2020-12-16 21:38:34 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @DrGBuckingham @ag_mitchell we know... its insane really (IMO)
1339200415578075139 2020-12-16 21:27:14 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @DrGBuckingham @ag_mitchell thank Gav. The good news is that F got promoted at least. So seems emphasis is on 4* papers which was not clear to any of us. Don't get me started on internal REF ratings though... and there is no holistic approach here.
1339196694467112960 2020-12-16 21:12:27 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @DrGBuckingham Thanks Gav I appreciate this... sadly that does not match the internal mock rating
1339196503974350848 2020-12-16 21:11:42 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @veliacardin Thanks Velia - I really appreciate you coming out and saying this specially as you use to work here. I need to have published 3 papers of at least 3* or ideally 4*. Given high teaching load etc I am struggling to see how...
1339192061292122114 2020-12-16 20:54:03 +0800 <StephanieRossit> If you'd like to assess yourself here is my google scholar:  https://t.co/eM74vLzdQo
1339191845000122369 2020-12-16 20:53:11 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @semacpherson Thank you Sarah - I really appreciate this. We are shocked as well and maybe there are big changes we need to do! Onward and upwards.
1339190346148929542 2020-12-16 20:47:14 +0800 <StephanieRossit> Thanks for your support all. I received detailed feedback today and apparently the papers I published in the last 5 years were not up to 3-4* standard (internally rated). But everything else was great and I have grants, amazing student ratings and impact activity &amp; took mat leave  https://t.co/WriYZBRvQW
1338861636287795206 2020-12-15 23:01:03 +0800 <StephanieRossit> Great conference and there will be a fabulous keynote too so submit early!
1338539382010212355 2020-12-15 01:40:32 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @OlgiatiE congratulations Dr. Olgiati! Amazing news!!!

1337701001227194374 2020-12-12 18:09:06 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @drdrewdunn 2)as you say it‚Äôs important we don‚Äôt blame ourselves but realize that we have done the best we could. If a system does not reward hard working people that it‚Äôs not worthy of this.
1337700658640789504 2020-12-12 18:07:44 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @drdrewdunn 1)Sorry to hear this. It‚Äôs Important to share as the promotion applications seem to lack transparency (at least from where I am standing). I have 22 papers (+ 2 preprints) applied for 19+ million in grants and brought in 200k+ with a substantial teaching and admin load on top.
1337544622894092299 2020-12-12 07:47:43 +0800 <StephanieRossit> Thank you @peterakirk very kind words üôè . I am blown away by all these comments and you were such a dedicated bright student. I am sure you will do great things!

1337459900268634116 2020-12-12 02:11:03 +0800 <StephanieRossit> Another Friday of covid year 2020 and I did NOT get promoted... what a year! (sharing this as I think its important to share the loses in academia too). How much does it take to become a SL?  https://t.co/bOkAgeUBDq

1332298647640416256 2020-11-27 20:22:05 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @DrGBuckingham yap its tough. I use frequent pools to get audience feedback and have a smiley face next to webcam. That helps a lot.
1332238024483221505 2020-11-27 16:21:11 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @EmPlayfair I would have loved to attend this and have emailed @RCOT_NP to ask if I could join as a external member as I am not an OT but a psychologist doing research in neglect assessment and rehab. I received no response. Would love to join you guys!
1332044623057985536 2020-11-27 03:32:40 +0800 <StephanieRossit> Do you work in brain injury/Neuropsychology (clinical or research) ? Can you take in a some of my brilliant MSc Psychology students for a 2 week placement? Happy to return the favour and placement can be remote. Please DM me if you can!

1329929837700665347 2020-11-21 07:29:16 +0800 <StephanieRossit> I have been mentored by amazing female scientists and would never change that. I learn from women in science everyday. Women mentors are as good as men mentors. All this data just reflects the bias towards man in academia. Simple..  https://t.co/EcJtyu0U67

1317067146812399616 2020-10-16 19:37:32 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @ag_mitchell @UEANeuroLab @UEAPsychology @ethanknights @Diana_Tonin thanks Alex. Welcome any feedback you have :)
1316751104554733569 2020-10-15 22:41:42 +0800 <StephanieRossit> 5/5 - These findings indicate that representations of how to grasp tools for use are automatically evoked in visual regions specialised for representing the human hand.
1316751102403117056 2020-10-15 22:41:41 +0800 <StephanieRossit> 4/5 - We found that representations about whether a 3D tool is being grasped appropriately for use were decodable from hand-selective areas (LOTC-Hand and IPS-Hand), but not from tool-, object-, or body-selective areas.
1316751100477870081 2020-10-15 22:41:41 +0800 <StephanieRossit> 3/5 - Using MVPA we tested if brain activity patterns would differ depending on whether grasping was consistent or inconsistent with how tools are typically grasped for use (e.g., grasp knife by the handle rather than its serrated edge)
1316751098036850688 2020-10-15 22:41:40 +0800 <StephanieRossit> 2/5 - Here we tested whether independently visually-defined category-selective areas (such as LOTC-hands or LOTC-tools and similar areas in IPS) are sensitive to real action properties involving 3D tools.
1316751095675465730 2020-10-15 22:41:39 +0800 <StephanieRossit> 1/5 - Check out @UEANeuroLab @UEAPsychology new preprint of fMRI work led by @ethanknights in coll. with Fraser Smith (UEA) @Diana_Tonin et alüëáüß† Hand-selective visual regions represent how to grasp 3D tools for use: brain decoding during real actions  https://t.co/3eEygGhvY8

1314609540017664003 2020-10-10 00:51:53 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @dr_f_gracey Thank you Fergus. We need to support each other to stay strong üí™! Have a good weekend!
1314550557139443720 2020-10-09 20:57:30 +0800 <StephanieRossit> If you can spare a minute, write a nice email to thank a colleague for their work. We are all working very hard in HE so thanking people and spreading kindness can make someone's day a little better. I have been doing this for a wee while and the responses I receive are worth it.
1314237159990325249 2020-10-09 00:12:10 +0800 <StephanieRossit> Mandatory reading @UEANeuroLab
1314233021747400709 2020-10-08 23:55:44 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @cgillebert @JanetBultitude @NeleDemeyere totally agree. But def need to correct as there are too many not too. Lesions extremely variable but you could show students volume size of lesions (I report this in my papers) and get n voxels by assuming 3mm resolution (however big con there are some mapped from CT scans).
1313804404949213186 2020-10-07 19:32:34 +0800 <StephanieRossit> 3/3: I suffer from facial pain. Sometimes I can‚Äôt smile and if you know me, you know I like to do that a lot. The pain leaves me exhausted too and the only thing left to do is to go to bed. Be kind &amp; understanding. You don‚Äôt know what others are going through üíïüß†
1313804401618882562 2020-10-07 19:32:33 +0800 <StephanieRossit> 2/3: Sometimes it's a dull ache (like tooth ache) but that is the good pain. Other times it‚Äôs a stabbing pain like electric shocks and it feels like someone is peeling your face off (literally). No wonder they call it the suicide disease. Today its facial pain awareness day.
1313804398896861184 2020-10-07 19:32:32 +0800 <StephanieRossit> 1/3: Imagine 1day half your face stops working because one of your cranial nerves is injured and you struggle to do things like eating &amp; even loose your smile. Some weeks later you luckily recover movement, but you are left with facial pain that sometimes is excruciating.  https://t.co/VnvU4RjXEA
1313513201393438725 2020-10-07 00:15:25 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @JanetBultitude @MichaelProulx @hmorse8 Thanks. BMJ Open was similar for us recently but sounds like it was faster than the ones you suggest. Thanks for sharing the info! The fees are so high you would think they would be efficient!

1310563864271032320 2020-09-28 20:55:48 +0800 <StephanieRossit> Wish I could see the faces of our MSc students when they watch this thrilling video by Prof. Kanwisher (MIT) as part of their preparation exercises for our neuroanatomy session this week:  https://t.co/H1yBGyIT7B That is what I call amazing teaching skills!
1310483514484236290 2020-09-28 15:36:32 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @micheleveldsman Sometimes funders allow you to apply at later deadlines that take into account mat leave etc. May be worth asking them. The worst they can say is no but you would expect in this day and age that they should make allowances. Good luck with it all. You are super academic mum!
1310339903889313793 2020-09-28 06:05:52 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @micheleveldsman Support network is super critical and it depends on fellowship deadline and how much you can lift off from other places. You also need to be kind to yourself and enjoy your new baby and sleep when they sleep. A female prof told me this once and I can‚Äôt thank her enough.
1309631725891452928 2020-09-26 07:11:49 +0800 <StephanieRossit> @ag_mitchell @UoE_Psychology Oh yes please! I hope so too.  Scanner is getting ready here so we could collect some data for your fellowship project! You are not getting rid of me so easy!

1306894571650060301 2020-09-18 17:55:21 +0800 <StephanieRossit> 5/6: Quite timely with @TheStrokeAssoc report yesterday reporting a detrimental impact of covid19 in stroke rehabilitation:  https://t.co/RGeRfC2WWj
1306894569754198017 2020-09-18 17:55:21 +0800 <StephanieRossit> 4/6: End-user perspectives enabled us to produce practical recommendations to inform development, enhance engagement and uptake of VR telerehabilitation.
1306894567803887620 2020-09-18 17:55:20 +0800 <StephanieRossit> 3/6: End-users identified feedback, engagement, enjoyment, and psychological benefits as facilitators of self-administered VR telerehab. Overall, end-users were positive and interested in using VR telerehab for spatial neglect (even those without prior tech experience).
1306894565610323976 2020-09-18 17:55:20 +0800 <StephanieRossit> 2/6: We asked stroke survivors, carers and clinicians what they thought of telerehab tools including c-SIGHT (new version of @sightUEA developed with funding from @NIHRBrainMIC and being tested with @TheStrokeAssoc in collaboration with @Virtualrehab_en) and VirtualRehab
1306894563290812416 2020-09-18 17:55:19 +0800 <StephanieRossit> 1/6: New paper out today led by @TheStrokeAssoc funded @hmorse8 @UEANeuroLab @UEAPsychology exploring perspectives from stroke survivors, carers and clinicians on VR telerehab for neglect:  https://t.co/I0ogGlawGh
