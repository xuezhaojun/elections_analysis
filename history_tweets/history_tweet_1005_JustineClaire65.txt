1344009862523584514 2020-12-30 03:58:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Roberthastosay Yes, it does say they won't get around to discussing it properly until the second half of 2021. Change is so glacial with the EU, by the time they seal the deal the world will have moved  on😂

1343957382678925316 2020-12-30 00:29:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lucyallan You can say what you like, in fact you just did, but we all know that isn’t the whole picture don’t we. So what do you suggest we should do.
1343955715887652865 2020-12-30 00:23:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @MarcCorbishley Yes, I’m Northern, there was no choice😉

1343951360941830146 2020-12-30 00:05:48 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @YorksBrie1648 Yeah, I thought that and also people may have bulk bought but second class is only going up by a penny😡 I’ll do online in future not worth the hassle.

1343948635143344129 2020-12-29 23:54:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ShelaghFogarty @LBC this woman is pathetic. She knows that the referendum result was backed by other results at the ballot box. Eg the 2019 GE an 80 seat majority. Get a life is my attitude to people like her.
1343936032283250696 2020-12-29 23:04:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Keep educating all kids not just those who can access stuff online or have a place to study.  Keep schools open.
1343935274636767233 2020-12-29 23:01:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @miss_b_heaven I never knew it was a thing until my partner saw my sad face returning from the post office. Who'd have thought a Post Office would be out of stamps after Christmas. I guess some people are bulk buying because they go up in Jan but no second class either.
1343931524064882689 2020-12-29 22:46:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @kerrydixon11111 So Caroline you wanted a no deal Brexit after all🤷🏻‍♀️
1343930607668260865 2020-12-29 22:43:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LondonFM1 Oh thank you that's a really kind offer but I managed to print the label off in the end. You know how you think you're coping well and then the smallest thing can expose a crack? It's the first year in my nearly 56 where I have not seen him. Hoping 2021 will be better x
1343929176835940352 2020-12-29 22:37:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DrTeePhD @DawnNeesom @sevillerholt Give some examples which may help people understand. And which position are you coming at this from?
1343928182341312512 2020-12-29 22:33:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @kerrydixon11111 @LBC @CarolineLucas Ahhh I see, I'll go and check what she said. They have all reacted the same haven't they, the remoaners. Starmer would probably like to do the same but he knows he can say a definite goodbye to northern Brexit voters if he did. The others will never be in power anyway, thankfully
1343927401798135808 2020-12-29 22:30:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GreatUK77 Hmmm ... I think he's talking bollox. It's a new variant of the language.
1343926895411396610 2020-12-29 22:28:35 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So just spent 15 mins walk to village post office, queued for 10 mins to buy a stamp for my brother's birthday card. For my brother who I haven't seen for 12 months. They ran out of stamps before Christmas and still out of now😡 But you can buy online. My go to place from now on!
1343905707687600128 2020-12-29 21:04:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DawnNeesom @sevillerholt In the first lockdown we had staff from other parts of the NHS which we'd closed down to cover the Nightingales if needed. Now we are asking the NHS to do what they normally do plus deal with Covid. So if we keep Covid cases down the NHS may cope.

1343899285579034625 2020-12-29 20:38:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> No, I think it is far worse to not educate a generation of children. You as a supposed socialist should want this too.
1343898502947078144 2020-12-29 20:35:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Stephen90182822 Me too, proud to👍
1343898117989658627 2020-12-29 20:34:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LBC Maajid I don't know why you keep perpetuating the myth that Sage &amp; the govt did not think about the other impacts of lockdowns. I remember the very first briefing where Chris Witty explained all the concerns. That's why they have tried to not close other areas of the NHS.
1343885881812410369 2020-12-29 19:45:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> ⁦@LewisHamilton⁩ when you kneel &amp; do the salute &amp; wear the T Shirt that claims to care about equality for women in the Saudi Arabia grand prix.

Most work for a living, the clue is in the name. The Tories opened up buying your own home to the working classes, they support low taxation and they create jobs.  Hey, and I've never voted Tory.

Then when I left home I just drank coffee. I occasionally have a tea but it has to be sweet and milky to disguise the taste🤦🏻‍♀️.

1343621230818177024 2020-12-29 02:13:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @OfVarga @GreatUK77 If you know anything about me, which you don't, you should know that I am not an anti lockdown person. I have supported the government throughout. But being locked down would make some people more prone to depression and suicide. That's an actual fact.
1343619115416743936 2020-12-29 02:05:35 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @OfVarga @GreatUK77 Oh ok. I copied &amp; pasted a tweet which may have been factually incorrect to make sure that people are vigilant about suicide. Maybe I was particularly keen to do that as a 22 year old friend of my son's committed suicide last week.  Maybe that's still a bit raw.  Happy now?
1343616989969993731 2020-12-29 01:57:08 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @OfVarga @GreatUK77 I don't know that it is a lie, do you?
1343616503351021572 2020-12-29 01:55:12 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @OfVarga @GreatUK77 Correct.  I tweet about suicide because I have lost people I have loved to it.   I make no apology for continuing to do so as it may save a life.  Please feel free to be annoyed at that.
1343613136545447936 2020-12-29 01:41:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @OfVarga @GreatUK77 I'm not interested in the statistics to be honest. It is more important to know that suicide is something that happens too frequently and is preventable. So sharing the number is the important thing.

1343604357313527808 2020-12-29 01:06:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So all that effort to fight a no deal Brexit was just a load of bollocks then?  And I think your fight is to rejoin the EU, that isn't independence now is it.
1343602465040719872 2020-12-29 00:59:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TimPendry @TomSyvret It would appear so. But we haven't forgotten.

1343278284260454401 2020-12-28 03:31:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Because it was every 'man' for himself at the beginning with borders closing and each nation buying tons of PPE at the expense of poorer nations.  Making a 'show' of working together was more important than saving lives.
1343277624341225472 2020-12-28 03:28:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> The vote is for the deal or for no deal. So on principle you are voting for no deal, when you cried about how terrible that was for 4.5 years.  You are just soooo principled🤨
1343276066555703304 2020-12-28 03:22:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So you remember when the govt started the first lockdown 5 days after France and that meant they were responsible for thousands of unnecessary deaths🙄 So the EU are 3 weeks late rolling out the vaccine, how many unnecessary deaths are they responsible for? #ScumMedia
1343260244307271687 2020-12-28 02:19:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @cktwitta Errrr ........... no😂

1343112527706812416 2020-12-27 16:32:35 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @HotelLubyanka I understand your fear, I just don't share it.
1343110046583033857 2020-12-27 16:22:43 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @SteeeVoO9 @YvetteHenson Hmmm .. of all the negative things you could legitimately criticise him for, his use of the English language is not one of them.
1342933478921351168 2020-12-27 04:41:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @timberwolf1964 I think fishing has been sacrificed from the bits I have picked up.
1342931321098797063 2020-12-27 04:32:32 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Good luck with that 😂
1342930932718854144 2020-12-27 04:30:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Your attitude towards this country is shit and I am embarrassed to have people like you living in this great country.
1342928728112967683 2020-12-27 04:22:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @HotelLubyanka Maybe in a totalitarian state. If when the vulnerable have been vaccinated and life returns to ‘normal’ we are still restricted I’ll come back and concede the point. We are still in the middle of it just now though.
1342927818196398083 2020-12-27 04:18:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Matteo30115900 @Dojo50113598 Oh ok. So I have taken it as you believe you speak more languages fluently than Boris Johnson. Thanks for sharing.

1342924681779802119 2020-12-27 04:06:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LukeJohnsonRCP @prestick09 But you've worked it out Luke haven't you🙄 Just the rest of us dummies haven't.

1342922400351068161 2020-12-27 03:57:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Baddiel Only middle class people had even heard of this scheme.
1342919083814248448 2020-12-27 03:43:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TinalSeymour Yes, I was thinking the other day that we do have a lot of views in common, not just Brexit. Similar backgrounds and probably a similar age. Let's do that when we are able😁
1342918295494782978 2020-12-27 03:40:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Sweat6321 @petuniasforever @WonPeople @NWJK @DPJHodges @LozzaFox That happened in the first lockdown only when it was not clear what the numbers of Covid patients would be. Since then the NHS has been open for business. But they will close pdq if Covid admissions rise and NHS staff get ill.
1342912254312931328 2020-12-27 03:16:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WonPeople @NWJK @DPJHodges Look if you let everyone just do what they like then more people will get ill and end up using NHS resources and we will have even less chance of quick diagnosis for cancer etc. Do you see by helping one group you help the other.
1342907894661074954 2020-12-27 02:59:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WonPeople @NWJK @DPJHodges Captain Tom did more in his 100th year than most people do in their whole lifetimes. You can't say how long an individual has to live, an average is just that. #AllLivesMatter

1342788183294148609 2020-12-26 19:03:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Boris Johnson speaks many languages fluently. He studied classics at Oxford.  You are the ignoramus.  🤦🏻‍♀️

1342782733874061313 2020-12-26 18:42:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> A reminder that Scotland was NEVER a member of the EU.   The UK was the member of the EU.   The UK voted to leave.   That is democracy.
1342771340164669440 2020-12-26 17:56:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Whichever way you slice it, there is no doubt that me being Mayor falls well short of what’s best for London, the UK and our economy.    I do not come close to the previous Mayor Boris Johnson.

1342165607647739904 2020-12-25 01:49:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Seems the worst thing about this deal is that we don't want to be part of the Erasmus Programme.  I'm personally gutted🙄

1342117663447900160 2020-12-24 22:39:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Hhh .. hum ... but Boris fought and won in 2016 &amp; 2019. We left the EU in January 2020 like Boris said. And it looks like he may have got an FTA.  Wake up and smell the coffee Barry🙄😂
1342115794621263872 2020-12-24 22:31:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LBC But that's because Ireland is a tiny country and the UK is the 5th biggest economy in the world.

1342098844075622402 2020-12-24 21:24:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ShelaghFogarty @LBC Getting a lot of crying remainers, your listeners, who are stuck in bitterness. They should take a leaf out of Maajid Nawaz's book and move on🙄
1342092497229672450 2020-12-24 20:59:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LBC Pelagic fish live in the pelagic zone of ocean or lake waters – being neither close to the bottom nor near the shore – in contrast with demersal fish that do live on or near the bottom, and reef fish that are associated with coral reefs.

1342065261822812162 2020-12-24 19:11:07 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @bob_peckham Peckham Bob, what you on about now hun?   You need to retweet so that I know what you're referring to😁
1342064805444726788 2020-12-24 19:09:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @mike1963payne Yeah, let's hope. They have been AWOL on investigating the origins of Covid. A story that will likely be the main story in their lifetime.   Shockingly, shamefully remiss.
1342063879216627720 2020-12-24 19:05:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> The press conference is largely imminent😉
1342063751546236928 2020-12-24 19:05:07 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @welsh_mountie I don't think any of us are convinced but why aren't the MSM doing some proper journalism here. Surely they can't say that China is closed to them else China wins. That's just not good enough. It's so much easier to just blame everything on Boris isn't it.

1341863070486958082 2020-12-24 05:47:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> It’s France who closed the border nothing to do with Brexit. Happy with France doing this are you because you hate your own country so much?

1341691931261349889 2020-12-23 18:27:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LBC so you are interested in listening from the hundreds of thousands of unpaid carers too James? It's been a tough year if you are a carer.

1341685592460017666 2020-12-23 18:02:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LBC We have the most positive test results because we test more. And we now target areas where we have the most cases? Simple numbers are not useful here.
1341681630235291648 2020-12-23 17:46:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Deiniolman @SinghLions @Khalsa_Aid No they are not the same. An act of kindness should not be brought back to religion or race.

1341661073271877634 2020-12-23 16:25:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So I thought we had a committee of experts who decided on the vaccination roll out and priorities. Scientists and specialists.  Didn't realise that Tony had found another dossier from the internet on it.

1341428496632057859 2020-12-23 01:00:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> No we didn't, we saw many borders closed with mass immigration in 2015, mainly amongst east European countries. And they closed pdq with Covid didn't they.  National identity is still there like it was under communism. Just needs a brave country to break free from the shackles😁
1341426545211129856 2020-12-23 00:53:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @cpalace68 They are back now.
1341420819352793089 2020-12-23 00:30:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WeedenColin @Palmaprincess Maybe but that's not what I said is it. I said he looked exhausted. Why does that trigger you so much? He did look exhausted and he has had to work harder than any other Health Minister in my lifetime. End.
1341420087526494210 2020-12-23 00:27:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Kevinflipper1 @joelrwrites @tomhfh I think when I last looked that the EU is predominantly white and the commonwealth is predominantly black so why would brexiteers be racist? Surely, it was the remainers who wanted to keep their white only gated community?
1341418107974332418 2020-12-23 00:19:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DelphinePalmow1 So sorry, I have now. I had loads of follows yesterday and I must have skipped you for some reason😊
1341417689768742912 2020-12-23 00:17:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @opeyemiomojafo Yes, it could also be because there is more criminality in certain pockets of society. But we have to assume that disproportionality is linked to racism don't we. It is probably disproportionally a young, male problem too.
1341408292464160771 2020-12-22 23:40:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Paul_Hampton1 @Bulldog665 I didn't think he was clear.

1341397996206960640 2020-12-22 22:59:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WeedenColin @Palmaprincess They get paid nothing like their private sector comparable colleagues but don't let that fact get in the way of your narrative.
1341396432167833603 2020-12-22 22:53:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WeedenColin @Palmaprincess They are putting in place restrictions that we ALL have to follow including them and their families. Because we are in a global pandemic.  I can dish out my sympathy where I see fit as can you. Free country and all that😉

1341375100390674435 2020-12-22 21:28:40 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Maybe you could look at why there is more criminality amongst BAME young people. Or are you saying we need to criminalise more white kids to even it out?  What exactly are you saying David?
1341373799456010240 2020-12-22 21:23:29 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ledbury_john He's a drama queen. Couldn't even say "criminal negligence" had to say "close to". Sort of like saying you were close to stabbing someone to death as you peeled the spuds with a knife.

1341296706537844738 2020-12-22 16:17:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @rgilbert59 I think that people need to consider what other countries are doing to get some perspective on this. Politicians want to be reelected, restricting people's movement isn't a vote winner.

But to say Hancock and Johnson are evil. That it's a big hoax. No, that just is at odds with reality. If you look back that's what my tweet said.

1341105184924196866 2020-12-22 03:36:07 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @richard_bishop1 Sorry, I misunderstood. He got rather agitated that the govt couldn't explain how they were going to do the tests that the French seem to have randomly suggested needed to happen. No questioning of the unreasonableness of the test😂 My favourite bit that was.

I believe that we are in the middle of a global pandemic, that our govt is doing the best it can to deal with it. I support their efforts &amp; calling this a hoax &amp; Hancock evil is just plain nasty.

We did flatten the curve, it took longer than 3 weeks but given we had never done that before nothing was ever certain. Not a lie. A decision taken with the best evidence available at the time.

1341073651567833089 2020-12-22 01:30:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @rammieib @FrankMcCann2 You don't listen. He knew about the variant from October, from a sample taken in October. They knew it was a new variant but didn't know how it behaved. So they monitored the data and it transmits more easily. Advised of this on Friday. So NOT a lie.
1341072853953880072 2020-12-22 01:27:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @alkcheet @rammieib @FrankMcCann2 Tell me the lie or lies and I'll consider them. Just don't tell me he lies without proving it.

1340675611749212161 2020-12-20 23:09:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Salywebster I don't see why. He knows exactly how it all works. Will take a replacement a long time to get up to speed. We need consistency not continual pointless resignations because some people don't understand that different rules apply in wars and pandemics.
1340675024076877826 2020-12-20 23:06:48 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Andego1986 I think you are going down the libel route here. But hey, you don't need to evidence an opinion I grant you.😁

1340664469177982977 2020-12-20 22:24:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lbc Maajid you have got this wrong about Hancock. He knew about the variant in October. He only knew that it was much more infectious on Friday. Please read through your stuff again. This was clear to me from Hancock on Marr this morning. Listen to it because you are dangerous.
1340662692747628545 2020-12-20 22:17:48 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lbc You don't allow people to get their point across. You are experienced at talking on the radio and you need to give people time to express themselves through their nervousness. You are bullying and censoring people like Peter.
1340661120990916610 2020-12-20 22:11:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lbc On #marr Hancock said the new variant was known about in October from a sample in September BUT on Friday they got data stating this variant was much more infectious. That was the trigger.   Stop encouraging people to call him a liar and hiding behind your callers.
1340657772606722052 2020-12-20 21:58:15 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @albarrett65 It seems like it is😁

1340657153267425281 2020-12-20 21:55:48 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lbc There has been division &amp; distrust in this country since June 2016. This has continued thru' Covid where political point-scoring is more important to some than supporting a govt through a pandemic. Why are we surprised if politicians are defensive? Listen to yourself Maajid.

A mistake is not a lie. What appears true at one moment may later appear false, not a lie.   A lie is a deliberate act to deceive.

He resolved the PPE supply problem, got our testing capacity to the highest in Europe, got the Nightingale hospitals in place should we have needed them. He’s given us guidance and been polite &amp; dignified throughout.

1340620815356866562 2020-12-20 19:31:24 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JanewithoutaY @DarrylMcGarvey So the NHS staff have had a break, they take leave like the rest of us but when they are on duty they have a lot more to contend with. They have a lot more to contend with because we have a pandemic and lots of numpties are ignoring the guidance.#personalresponsibility

1340602482616135681 2020-12-20 18:18:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @HimerMike Did you hear the bit where he said he'd phoned his mother because he now can't see her over Christmas. Or do you just want him to be a bastard because it makes you feel better about life?
1340602021108396032 2020-12-20 18:16:43 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Cx3650 Funnily enough people in high pressure jobs do work hard and don't get paid the minimum wage.   Life's a bitch.
1340601023333842948 2020-12-20 18:12:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Turkey123mcfcok They knew about the variant from OCTOBER they just found out about the increased infection rate from it on FRIDAY. Clearer?

1340599690149163011 2020-12-20 18:07:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> #marr Matt Hancock looks really exhausted. Like him or not he has worked his socks off for the whole year.
1340599390038323200 2020-12-20 18:06:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @davefromglossop Merry Christmas to you too David.
1340599112207454209 2020-12-20 18:05:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Turkey123mcfcok No, it was a sample from September picked up in October. They have been looking at its behaviour since October and this Friday they were advised of its increased infection rate this Friday. Don't let the truth interfere with your narrative though #marr
1340598414086647808 2020-12-20 18:02:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Ashby_Time @CruttersJnr Yes, stupidity has been with us forever.

1340594728094580739 2020-12-20 17:47:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Or Lisa Nandy maybe Boris Johnson only changed the Christmas plans when he had the evidence about the new variant? Rather than just locking everyone down for ever like you'd prefer #marr

The Nightingales were there to deal with excess cases that never happened because the lockdown slowed the spread and we didn't need them.

1340423145950482432 2020-12-20 06:25:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @richardhuw1 @SophieCorcoran0 Because it wasn't that easy to infect other people. And there were precautions that worked.

He puzzled and puzzled till his puzzler was sore.  Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before.  Maybe Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store.

He's having to do things that go against his view of the world because it's a pandemic. Different rules apply. Like everywhere else in the western world.  I like John Redwood a lot but his ship has sailed.
1340393250742558723 2020-12-20 04:27:08 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @rjheathfield @campbellclaret Always polite😂  I think Johnson's first responsibility is to keep us safe. His behaviour is similar to other world leaders in countries badly affected by Covid.   As you know I didn't vote him in but I really don't know who would have handled this better.
1340391382675042305 2020-12-20 04:19:43 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @PaleHorse618 @campbellclaret True, although obviously I only despise the one.

1340390011473174531 2020-12-20 04:14:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> All those slagging off Johnson for being the bearer of bad news are on the same side as @campbellclaret.  Think about that.

1340364243548467202 2020-12-20 02:31:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @welsh_mountie Well he supported that firebreak which really didn't have any proper impact and told Boris Johnson that people would die unnecessarily because he delayed a second lockdown.  Totally dreadful opposition. Heaven help us if they ever get in.

1340357958060879879 2020-12-20 02:06:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> You literally told Johnson to do precisely this last week.  So much for supporting the govt during the pandemic.🙄

1340244742920146944 2020-12-19 18:37:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Labour a bit quiet on this as they were praising Wales for their firebreak and criticising the UK govt for not following suit.  Remember?

1340234192249102336 2020-12-19 17:55:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GGsnapper I agree. I tend to look around the other nations in the UK and around Europe, England is not an outlier. You only have to look at Germany who responded by far the best in Europe at the beginning to see how difficult this has been for most countries.

At best he's doing what's likely to be acceptable to enough sensible people. If we followed the pure science we would be locked up permanently, but there would be civil disobedience on a big scale, me included.
1340224631085690881 2020-12-19 17:17:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @BreffniHugh No, and you are quite right. The vote in the 1970s was to remain in the common market. Successive governments didn't give us any say on the closer union we ended up with. So a vote to remain should have had more discussion. But it wouldn't have.
1340222069779345409 2020-12-19 17:06:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WoodmanGS They have a balancing act to perform because lockdowns aren't benign, they cause other harms which may be worse. Governments do not replace our own personal responsibility, we can't have freedom without that responsibility, unless we want to live in China. Which I don't.

1339683221131419648 2020-12-18 05:25:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Ridiculous.  Unicef to feed hungry children in UK for first time in 70-year history  https://t.co/PmpubWsDDO

1339638878874034177 2020-12-18 02:29:32 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @zarahsultana If we need Unicef to feed our children then we shouldn't be sending any tax payers money overseas. That would be wrong don't you agree?
1339615382081069059 2020-12-18 00:56:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LettingFocus @dominiquetaegon Yes, if you consider stopping people dying or being admitted to hospital pretty crap 🙄

1339309182558883840 2020-12-17 04:39:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> What does abused mean? Did she use hurty words?
1339305956715483137 2020-12-17 04:26:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AnnloMyles @nadhimzahawi Why would he have taken it?

1339301533591199758 2020-12-17 04:09:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @teresadg0 Sneaky those glasses of Baileys aren't they. I've just spotted a glass of white wine abseiling down the living room wall.😂
1339298051236765697 2020-12-17 03:55:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Ok so for the hard of thinking &amp; mean spirited like Barry.  People are going to behave differently at Christmas because they have had a 💩 year.  The govt have very sensibly taken account of this &amp; loosened restrictions a little bit.  We are adults we get to decide how to behave.
1339281327372324865 2020-12-17 02:48:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @simonjgarrett @rec777777 @BBCNews I've got to be honest with you, anything that states @Channel4 and Fact Check does not fill me with confidence😂 But given that the EU is such a great place you would have thought they could have signed off the vaccine before our little old country.
1339236055405486081 2020-12-16 23:48:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> What an absolutely disgusting lack of facts.  Let's have the breakdown by ethnicity of all men convicted of this kind of crime compared to the national breakdown.   Mainly white offenders in a mainly white society is just horse💩 journalism.  #ScumMedia at its scummiest.
1339231701873143812 2020-12-16 23:31:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @simonjgarrett @rec777777 @BBCNews I just know it was approved for the UK to use much earlier than the EU. Am I wrong about that?
1339194732635951105 2020-12-16 21:04:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> And the rest of us live in a digital age🙄

1339179685650034690 2020-12-16 20:04:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Hey, the EU will have a vaccine approved within a week. Everything is so much better in the EU isn’t it?🙄
1339177328170168320 2020-12-16 19:55:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @minxyminx1952 Although they would have got to the same point, maybe just earlier.

1339173516982308864 2020-12-16 19:40:21 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @kwilliam111 @pritipatel @BorisJohnson   This is STILL going on because we haven’t dealt with it.   We haven’t dealt with it because we value political correctness above the lives of vulnerable children.   In 2020.
1339139474593378304 2020-12-16 17:25:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> As with most things in life, most people do the right thing most of the time, so that the minority have the freedom to do what the hell they like.
1339136086719782912 2020-12-16 17:11:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So the story about Cummings is that he was massively underpaid and this was corrected so that he was paid the same as other people at his level.  Hmm .. bit like the Covid issue and Cummings. A pile of 💩 because the #ScumMedia don't like him.
1339135165201838081 2020-12-16 17:07:57 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Kick all racism and indulging Marxist organisations out of football.  Listen to the customer, they are usually right.
1339125784112459777 2020-12-16 16:30:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Oh you live in London do you Ed? Never have guessed.   And still flying a foreign flag instead of your own.  Still unelectable😂
1338924646545166337 2020-12-16 03:11:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @davefromglossop Just one way.
1338919069727252484 2020-12-16 02:49:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I think indigenous people refers to those who are proud of their country rather than those who despise it 🤨

Confusing messages.  Hmm ... or reacting to different infection rates, listening to the science?  #RIPPersonalResponsibility
1338762686620950529 2020-12-15 16:27:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LBC A very big bus company does not impose the mask wearing. So if someone walks on without a mask they are not challenged. I am advised that in a big northern city you have about 25% of passengers without masks.
1338751904025882624 2020-12-15 15:45:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnMac84066427 So we can't cooperate with the rest of the world if we have independence? I think we managed before the EU don't you?🙄   A democratic decision was made and if you believe in democracy then you need to respect, if not agree, with that decision. Otherwise you don't want democracy.
1338559209571577856 2020-12-15 02:59:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So when you woke up this morning did you just look in the mirror and think today would be a good day to stab the leader of my party in the back?

1338551837587288065 2020-12-15 02:30:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @luscbradford @_Two_Up_Top_ @Neilfax Well that's where your economic experts come in. Because we have a service economy we have suffered more. Apparently.
1338550828764782593 2020-12-15 02:26:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @luscbradford @_Two_Up_Top_ @Neilfax Well you failed.
1338549749318873093 2020-12-15 02:21:43 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @clivey_p No we didn't vote for a car crash we voted to leave the EU. That's what we are doing.
1338542149110013966 2020-12-15 01:51:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @luscbradford @_Two_Up_Top_ @Neilfax It's all about money to you isn't it nothing else matters. I don't buy and sell currency I work in a proper job.
1338541568173760512 2020-12-15 01:49:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @luscbradford @_Two_Up_Top_ @Neilfax Do you think events like Covid may trigger a weakening of the pound or is it just Brexit that affects it adversely?
1338539775960227842 2020-12-15 01:42:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @luscbradford @_Two_Up_Top_ @Neilfax Yes, good idea.

1338536243307679747 2020-12-15 01:28:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @luscbradford @_Two_Up_Top_ @Neilfax Because that's how markets adjust to change.
1338535748753108997 2020-12-15 01:26:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @_Two_Up_Top_ @luscbradford @Neilfax Me neither.
1338497910619709440 2020-12-14 22:55:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JBYoung80 @lordclifton2 @uk_sf_writer Two comments:  1. Loved the indignation about the lack of EU scrutiny being undemocratic! Since when was the EU democratic!  2. So the UK doesn't scrutinise Trade agreements for as long as the EU. Great. So we won't be waiting 10 years for ours then🙄
1338496353853435907 2020-12-14 22:49:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @luscbradford @_Two_Up_Top_ @Neilfax But that's what you have been told about us. I call myself British. I've never voted Tory. We may initially see some problems as we adjust to a new system but were those the same experts who said the sky would fall in even if we voted leave? There was a blip which then corrected.
1338495287623634946 2020-12-14 22:45:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @luscbradford @Neilfax You don't know what I think. I do want to understand better though. And given the response to this tweet a lot of people are confused by this behaviour.
1338494066263273473 2020-12-14 22:40:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @scruffiness You'd think😬
1338414497090908167 2020-12-14 17:24:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LBC @NickFerrariLBC Let's be honest we cannot trust Keir Starmer on anything to do with Brexit. He was in charge of the failed second referendum policy. And over promised to honour the result of the referendum and under delivered by having absolutely no intention of doing that.
1338397484515807233 2020-12-14 16:16:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Ace50180813 @brexflecks Aahh sounds like he's not the full ticket.👍
1338233969469517826 2020-12-14 05:26:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @brexflecks Are you a bot?  The UK is a democracy, well respected at that. And intelligence is not linked to nationality is it, that's just silly.  So where are you from as your English suggests this is not your mother tongue.
1338231880760631302 2020-12-14 05:18:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> What the hell🙄
1338231244572725249 2020-12-14 05:16:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Bradley82067767 Interesting. So it is a lack of shared identity? Because for most of us we have a language (quite a popular one across the world too), we have clear borders (we are an island) and we have had different religions for a long time.
1338230195891924993 2020-12-14 05:11:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @warrenf00668424 Well they have until the end of Dec. Then we are out on WTO anyway.
1338229897043595271 2020-12-14 05:10:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Durteger @brexitisus Oh no you've asked the inevitable 'benefits' question. It's on a loop that question. So benefits can't be realised until we are out properly can they, anything else would be pure speculation wouldn't it? So it's a pointless discussion until next year.
1338228676228505603 2020-12-14 05:05:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @brexflecks Is it? Does that explain your swastika.  I'm more of a democrat personally.
1338226686446489600 2020-12-14 04:57:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @rejuicer State of you.
1338225850689478663 2020-12-14 04:54:40 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Michelle19691 'The truth'. 🙄 At best he was just giving his opinion. But he was very agitated and aggressive.
1338225123015479298 2020-12-14 04:51:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @brexflecks When you wonder why some British people supported the nazis, think of Justine. Because that is the analogy you were looking for brexflecks.  You're welcome.
1338222659671363591 2020-12-14 04:41:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @clivey_p It was a democratic decision. You may not like it but that's how democracies work.
1338218809048653825 2020-12-14 04:26:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @reetontime Absolutely, it's mainly about democracy. That's actually what most remainers never grasped. It's about democracy, sovereignty and independence. It is then about a belief in our ability to make a success of it based on our very successful history and position on the world stage.

1338215683461685250 2020-12-14 04:14:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @wesmcneill @uk_sf_writer If you love the UK then you respect the democratic decision to leave. Whilst you may feel that will turn out to be the wrong decision you don't side with the EU against the UK surely.
1338214181405929473 2020-12-14 04:08:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Jasonhasplans So we have the freedom to eat ourselves.😁
1338213806779019264 2020-12-14 04:06:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @sassycassyL But by supporting the EU you are acting against the UK. Even if you don't agree with leaving, by siding with the EU you will not change the decision to leave, it will just potentially mean we are made to suffer. Why would you want to make your country suffer?
1338211553594789891 2020-12-14 03:57:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @4DegreesWest @KellyParl It's not exactly a reason to overturn a democratic decision for independence is it. I live with someone who has had difficulties getting travel insurance for a health condition.
1338210792055902208 2020-12-14 03:54:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Durteger @brexitisus It's not a matter of faith is it, it's about democracy and wanting the best outcome in the negotiation for your country. We decided to leave the EU not invade Iraq🙄
1338190486595571712 2020-12-14 02:34:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Legion_Cool No, it was the radio phone ins rather than Twitter that made me send that tweet.

1338180940334592006 2020-12-14 01:56:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Uneverthoughtov You are not an independent thinker. You chose the status quo. The independent thinkers chose to leave a system that is undemocratic and based on rich countries being propped up by cheap labour from poor countries.
1338177928216125441 2020-12-14 01:44:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Raynerc113 So want the destruction of their own country by a foreign power so that they can say I told you so. That makes sense😜
1338176414282084358 2020-12-14 01:38:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @eddiedixon461 I don't have a problem with people not agreeing with the democratic decision. Just don't understand why they want us to do badly. Seems like they are cutting their nose off to spite their face.  But if the EU don't want an FTA there are plenty more fish in the sea😉
1338175488980881408 2020-12-14 01:34:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @neutralinterest @pvartlum The poor voted for it because they have not seen any of the benefits of being in the EU, just the problems. And the rich will stay because it's a great country.
1338166168025182208 2020-12-14 00:57:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Alexhudson15 No, it's a bit more important than that.🙄
1338165997665198083 2020-12-14 00:56:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Christinehp01 That's an honest answer.

1338135983544553474 2020-12-13 22:57:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Why do so many British people support the EU in this negotiation?Normally you support your own country.

1338118553543856128 2020-12-13 21:48:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> This is not even coherent🙄  We did ok (lost) in 2017.  We had the worse result since the 1930s in 2019.  So that means our policies are right😂  Hmmm ...
1338117515696869376 2020-12-13 21:44:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @0_politics2 Don't you start😂
1338112978978283524 2020-12-13 21:26:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Sandancer60 Someone else said something very similar, thought I'd missed something😁
1338111643402854400 2020-12-13 21:20:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TinalSeymour @SaltyDuchess Me too. We will negotiate a deal when we are out, over time, and we should support some of our businesses with some of the money we no longer pay in.
1338110728365027329 2020-12-13 21:17:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Sandancer60 Is it?
1338109784483094528 2020-12-13 21:13:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lbc I think it's WTO but that neither side want to look like they are the side that has given up first.
1338103044463079426 2020-12-13 20:46:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Sadie17689294 @gee4929 I thought the same.
1338102799670927360 2020-12-13 20:45:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ItsJustaRide Worth a look on iPlayer. If you need cheering up😉
1338102542203555841 2020-12-13 20:44:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @harrythedog44 Funny though😉
1338101559188664320 2020-12-13 20:40:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @tomswarbrick Oh God these remainers who still don't like democracy need to be given short-shrift. They have tried to block our ability to deliver Brexit all along. It takes John Abbott an Australian to tell us how great our country is. What's wrong with these miserable people.
1338095148849389568 2020-12-13 20:15:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TinalSeymour Definitely, I rewatched it and it looks like he was angry from the start. Really a bit of a 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ moment for him.
1338074191300612101 2020-12-13 18:52:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @offcorsa Good point.
1338071134311419904 2020-12-13 18:39:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Dancing47476032 Made my morning😂
1338070020295962625 2020-12-13 18:35:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DJT1Million Sure.  https://t.co/170zTjIjfU
1338063656303665153 2020-12-13 18:10:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JuliaHB1 Hope you watched Miliband's meltdown on #marr.
1338063323988975616 2020-12-13 18:08:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JuliaHB1 Haha .. like what you did there😁
1338063053041119232 2020-12-13 18:07:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @FrankMcCann2 It was fun😂
1338062850280091648 2020-12-13 18:06:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @kyrl23041714 @Tonguetiedstu I think he was really clear about our position. The fact that you don't agree with any of this doesn't make it false.
1338062518871339008 2020-12-13 18:05:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DJT1Million The EU put a Canada style deal on the table then took it off when they realised they would have a strong competitor on their doorstep. The EU has more understanding of how this country may flourish post Brexit than some people here have.
1338059693692948480 2020-12-13 17:54:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Tonguetiedstu Because Raab stops and listens to the questions. He doesn't rant and hyperventilate like Miliband did #marr
1338058060095512578 2020-12-13 17:47:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @MancTotter No the difference was that Miliband came on to rant and not to listen and answer. See how Raab answers a question and stops and listens to the next question. That's what the show is about.#marr
1338056407355183104 2020-12-13 17:41:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @SeparatistVegan @Ed_Miliband @Conservatives @BorisJohnson @BBCPolitics His opinion or the counter argument?
1338056226853310464 2020-12-13 17:40:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DJT1Million And likewise people who see the EU as an undemocratic declining empire don't understand why people on the other side can't support their country first. It's called a difference of opinion. And it's still allowed.
1338055129208066053 2020-12-13 17:36:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @SeparatistVegan @Ed_Miliband @Conservatives @BorisJohnson @BBCPolitics He's doing his job as a journalist rather than allowing Miliband to say what he wants unfettered. That's the point of the show.#marr
1338054449152004097 2020-12-13 17:33:35 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Ed Miliband in full meltdown #marr
1338053542163132416 2020-12-13 17:29:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DJT1Million Maybe think how a person may react if you call them a dangerous fool. Then I may take you seriously. You are just ranting and rude.
1338052783312932864 2020-12-13 17:26:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DJT1Million 😂 You better stock up on tissues.
1338052051251630081 2020-12-13 17:24:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> If you want to witness the #fbpe types in their full 'glory' for maybe the last time then check out  #marr 😂
1338050733153849344 2020-12-13 17:18:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DJT1Million I don't know whether Brexit is a disaster because we haven't properly left yet. But if there are some short term implications then I expected that. I also expected a WTO, Cameron made that very clear before the referendum. I know what I voted for and I'm happy with my decision.
1338048214243610626 2020-12-13 17:08:48 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @BreffniHugh @tabor1000 @TheSDPUK I follow the SDP on twitter, have done for a while. Hope it grows.
1338047642316771329 2020-12-13 17:06:32 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DJT1Million Not just the referendum which in itself should have been respected as promised. But the 2017 &amp; 2019 GEs and the EU Elections. Democracy is difficult if you don't get what you want.
1338046971307839488 2020-12-13 17:03:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @UB5simon It's not the best outcome but we have always known that it was a possibility.
1338046623495188482 2020-12-13 17:02:29 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Bullying or showing you mean business? After all this is about protecting your territorial waters. People who don't like borders and international law don't like that.
1338045892113420289 2020-12-13 16:59:35 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @BreffniHugh @tabor1000 @TheSDPUK I have. I like what I see but they don't have candidates in many areas.
1338045633245097986 2020-12-13 16:58:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DJT1Million And I'm sick of people who don't respect democracy or democratic decisions.
1338044122888810497 2020-12-13 16:52:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> If a nation chooses independence then it can't accept rules imposed by another nation or group of nations. So I feel sure there has been compromise on both sides but we are left with the real red lines. #marr
1338040156809474049 2020-12-13 16:36:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @SteveTheRanger1 Yes, good point Steve.
1337925809475112960 2020-12-13 09:02:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @CommonM82230275 Thanks 😁
1337893870093348866 2020-12-13 06:55:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @psibernaut @LemmyMcGregor Now who’s being disrespectful? 😉
1337893507747491840 2020-12-13 06:54:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @tabor1000 I will show some interest in any new political party as I believe the Labour &amp; Conservative Party have let us down in different ways for many years. And the LibDems are a joke.
1337892868481032197 2020-12-13 06:51:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @psibernaut @LemmyMcGregor I think I agree that our culture has made us wary of challenging issues like mass immigration and the problems with that because we fear being called racists. That’s come from somewhere and I’m conscious of it. But that is changing I believe.
1337890649929035788 2020-12-13 06:42:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @psibernaut @LemmyMcGregor The distinction is not clear. Socialists generally believe in democracy but big state whereas communists believe in totalitarianism. I think that Corbyn at least is not a communist. Doesn’t mean I like or agree with him.
1337888601359720449 2020-12-13 06:34:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LemmyMcGregor @psibernaut I’m talking of the comment made about the masses being indoctrinated by the left. If they were indoctrinated they wouldn’t have voted for Brexit or UKIP or the Brexit Party or Johnson.
1337887569116336136 2020-12-13 06:30:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @psibernaut @LemmyMcGregor I am not ignorant, I just don’t agree with you and I think if you read around socialism and the people you label as socialist you will find that most agree with me.
1337886192604471304 2020-12-13 06:24:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @psibernaut @LemmyMcGregor Silly is not disrespectful, it is what I think. No way are those people socialist by any normal interpretation of the word.  I apologise if I offended you. I think we should agree to disagree on this one.
1337884874498330627 2020-12-13 06:19:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @psibernaut @LemmyMcGregor How does that explain Brexit. If we were indoctrinated by the left we wouldn’t have repeatedly voted to leave the EU. You are confusing socialism (Corbyn, Momentum, BLM) with the religion of woke. The woke luvvies avoid paying tax and live in mansions fgs, that’s not socialism.
1337883621672316934 2020-12-13 06:14:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @psibernaut @LemmyMcGregor That’s just silly.
1337883239772540934 2020-12-13 06:13:15 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LemmyMcGregor @psibernaut That was pragmatism not far left ideology. He was faced with a pandemic and he got in by votes in the working class areas of the north. He promised levelling up because otherwise Tories would have been unelectable in the north as in Scotland.
1337882407979118592 2020-12-13 06:09:57 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LemmyMcGregor @psibernaut I want policies, with an action plan not ideology. I don’t care whether they say they are left or right so long as they appeal to the majority of the people and want a fairer society. This country is not extremist and never has been.
1337872738938183684 2020-12-13 05:31:32 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @mcmondat I'm not sure of their policies on education and health.
1337872497224593409 2020-12-13 05:30:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @psibernaut @LemmyMcGregor Major? Blair? Cameron? May? Johnson? All of these were/are towards the centre. Corbyn was extreme left and he never got voted in because of it. You have to go back to Thatcher to find an elected PM who was fairly far from the centre.
1337868935933407236 2020-12-13 05:16:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @psibernaut @LemmyMcGregor Not so sure. We have become too divided, left/right, black/white, haves/have nots. We need a government with a vision that brings us back to the centre where we generally as a country feel more comfortable. Must tick my boxes though for my vote.
1337867953904218118 2020-12-13 05:12:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LemmyMcGregor @psibernaut Sometimes when a party is labelled extreme (right/left) they attract racists &amp; I'm very nervous of that. I understand that lots of people are against Islamist extremism, I count myself in their number, but sometimes as with the Lab Party the racists jump aboard. That concerns me.
1337865884220739593 2020-12-13 05:04:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @KD2945974406 No problem, I was just being playful😁
1337865686048182275 2020-12-13 05:03:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LemmyMcGregor @psibernaut I'm nervous of a party labelled as far right or far left. I'm more of a centrist.
1337865029044105221 2020-12-13 05:00:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @anthea_bailey If he delivers a proper Brexit and manages to sort illegal immigration out as well as improving education for working class children then you never know I may vote Tory next time.
1337862514017759233 2020-12-13 04:50:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @anthea_bailey I don't believe they have been very successful on a number of items on there although if Boris is able to do what he said in his manifesto it would be closest.  He has been a bit woke in some ways hasn't he. Immigration, BLM?
1337861327205916673 2020-12-13 04:46:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @BarristersHorse Pocket size.
1337861027866828806 2020-12-13 04:44:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Most of us are able to work it out for ourselves and don't need to be told by the government.  I'll be celebrating the end of the transition period with a glass or two of bubbly. Will you be drowning your sorrows Anna?
1337859923003240451 2020-12-13 04:40:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @tmthywinter True.
1337859567812808705 2020-12-13 04:39:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Taylod61 The SDP comes the closest for me but if there's no candidate MPs then we can't vote for them.
1337858936871981058 2020-12-13 04:36:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @MalScrimgeour The Labour Party of old may have ticked most of those boxes, it now ticks none of them.
1337858270535569408 2020-12-13 04:34:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> There is no compromise because these remaining areas are the essence of independence. You cannot be independent and have another country dictate the rules.
1337857372845465605 2020-12-13 04:30:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Kev_IceHockey So sorry for your loss.
1337857143819689984 2020-12-13 04:29:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Could we please have a political party that:  -Puts the UK first -Is proud of our people &amp; our culture -Helps all children get a great education. -Invests wisely in the NHS -Believes all lives matter -Represents the many not the few.  We the politically homeless need a party.
1337854843470434316 2020-12-13 04:20:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> No you haven't.   You'd still rather talk about trans rights than illegal immigration or job creation.   You'd still prefer Oxbridge to be more diverse and yet leave white working class boys with the poorest education.   You still speak for the few and not the many.
1337853576517922817 2020-12-13 04:15:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> How could they let him out? Put him on a diet and let hm serve his time😡
1337852052752490496 2020-12-13 04:09:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @gerardjasper And prosper.
1337851266119192581 2020-12-13 04:06:12 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @KD2945974406 I do. I hate when people include your name in a tweet and then misspell it. I'm having counselling to get over it though.
1337823378468720640 2020-12-13 02:15:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Good luck with that😂

1337817828922187779 2020-12-13 01:53:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @BrianGarratt1 I doubt Boris could be bothered, she's obviously just bitter after losing her gravy train job😂
1337812675259224067 2020-12-13 01:32:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> 😂
1337811035147948037 2020-12-13 01:26:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> The Labour Party produce such nice people don't they. So professional.
1337772459337134080 2020-12-12 22:53:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @SpartanEdgeX28 I think we need to continue to try so that remainers (the sensible ones, the majority) can see how intransigent the EU is. And how impossible it would be for any PM in any country to sign the agreement they propose.
1337771240111673344 2020-12-12 22:48:12 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Exactly👏🏻
1337753865870053382 2020-12-12 21:39:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Like any big organisation with humans making decisions it's not perfect.  Why are we surprised by that?  The problem with our current culture is if it's not perfect then its got to be rubbish. Apparently.
1337752753188302848 2020-12-12 21:34:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @rjheathfield @ukmedicx @BorisJohnson Haha!

1337745139893202947 2020-12-12 21:04:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ukmedicx @BorisJohnson They are showing for themselves how incompetent they are at the moment. They don't need any reminder from Boris.

1337705860198506496 2020-12-12 18:28:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LBC Unlike your caller I voted to leave the EU, I didn't vote for any deal. It would have been good to have  an FTA but I always thought this would not be likely. The EU have to punish us to deter other like minded nations.

1337495808279793667 2020-12-12 04:33:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I think it's good that Boris keeps trying because it shows the EU up for what they are, a cumbersome, inflexible, bureaucratic 💩show.  I always wanted an FTA but doubted that the EU would agree because their institution would collapse like the house of cards that it is.

You had no idea why we voted leave then and you still have no idea. Do you think we have forgotten your deceit?  We will never forget and that's why you will never be PM.

1337325864053248007 2020-12-11 17:18:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @BobStPier1 I'm not soppy, I'm northern 🙄, but some things are just touching aren't they.
1337325505419370497 2020-12-11 17:17:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @PriestleyStacy I know, sometimes Boris appears a bit awkward in these situations but he looked very comfortable with that very touching human moment.
1337325071640236032 2020-12-11 17:15:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I think you are right but that is not because the rules are not clear - you only need to read up - but because we are human.

1337126843858776067 2020-12-11 04:07:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Nigel100007 That’s true she’ll probably write a book. Or get someone to write it for her😉
1337120561579905029 2020-12-11 03:42:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @CanonImages15 They are and they are also a media organisation and understand how this will look.
1337120215663058954 2020-12-11 03:41:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Nigel100007 No but it feels more like a punishment. It's a significant amount of pay so I think she will miss it. People live up to their means often.
1337119876465500162 2020-12-11 03:39:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Sandancer60 I hope so they have been so nasty and relentless. I still can't believe they were so stupid.

1337086998293733378 2020-12-11 01:29:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So Sky won't say whether they still get paid. That must be a terrible burden being suspended for 6 months on full pay.   Did the other two apologise?  https://t.co/H191itJM6a

1337019220576628737 2020-12-10 20:59:57 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Crispy31600409 @mac46100 Given there's a perfectly effective campaign called Kick It Out I must assume that, by adopting this controversial tag #BLM which has a double meaning, people are trying purposely to be divisive. Kick It Out incorporated all forms of racism not just white on black.
1336809542823370753 2020-12-10 07:06:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Crispy31600409 @mac46100 For goodness sake why adopt the same name as the extreme Marxist group. Football had a perfectly good ‘Kick It Out’ banner. Why choose #BLM? It’s unnecessarily antagonistic and divisive.

1336761156330024977 2020-12-10 03:54:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So QPR previously did not take the knee and when playing against Millwall they decided they would take the knee.   Hmmm ... such a principled bunch🙄
1336757796130447360 2020-12-10 03:41:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @BrittRubin1 They weren't silent about those cases with the allergic reaction. They said that people with a history of serious allergic reaction should not have this jab. Both people use epipens.
1336752271389024262 2020-12-10 03:19:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Wasn't invited🙄

If you called it something like .... "Kick it out" then everyone would support that.  But some people want to think that football fans are racist even though they are not. Why is that do you think?
1336725885647532032 2020-12-10 01:34:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TekThatEnglish Scot comes from skat (Scandinavian) which means tax or payment. So "without paying".  No gender inference on this occasion.

There's a lot of lesbian female professional footballers.  Not saying that gay players are impeded. Just that they don't feel comfortable with coming out maybe?
1336372393745506318 2020-12-09 02:09:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @IoanAnthony @LikeGoinThisWay Pleased I attracted a couple of doctors😂   Yeah, I'm not a journalist. Just sharing an observation that surprised me.
1336371718127054862 2020-12-09 02:07:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ronnocm2 Personally, I'm not concerned so much. I was just very surprised at how bad he had it. I have time to decide about the jab.
1336371230954426375 2020-12-09 02:05:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @secondcityape Maybe football has a problem with gay men?
1336358571504701440 2020-12-09 01:14:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @alastairdick Cheery welcome to the house😂
1336357931265253383 2020-12-09 01:12:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Busterdog7 Yes.
1336357745029689345 2020-12-09 01:11:29 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @alastairdick I must admit I was so surprised. This young man plays football and goes to the gym all the time. Very active. He has never really been poorly in his life he said.
1336357051166027776 2020-12-09 01:08:43 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @UryusW So illiberal.
1336356812677910530 2020-12-09 01:07:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LikeGoinThisWay Nothing. He has housemates of a similar age. One had mild symptoms and the other had no symptoms.
1336356361068834821 2020-12-09 01:05:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @PHIL_BERT Yes I think you are right and Rugby teams have a split with some kneeling and others not.
1336355958449197060 2020-12-09 01:04:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So just had a Teams call with a colleague who contracted Covid a few weeks ago. He was really poorly at home &amp; is still struggling with fatigue, no sense of taste/smell &amp; out of breath at the top of the stairs. He's 28, no underlying conditions, healthy weight and very fit.
1336354091153371138 2020-12-09 00:56:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Oooohhh triggered😂
1336353751813197836 2020-12-09 00:55:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @UryusW Now you're just talking plain crazy 😂😉
1336353457696108544 2020-12-09 00:54:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> 👏🏻
1336352951007408131 2020-12-09 00:52:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Better.
1336351837809729536 2020-12-09 00:48:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JC_free82 🥶
1336350803188215813 2020-12-09 00:43:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @mitsyarty You need a hot shower with plenty of shower gel to get rid of the dirt.
1336349504761638912 2020-12-09 00:38:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> 😂
1336258116606971904 2020-12-08 18:35:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @ConspiracyNonce No Mark there's only you who understands stuff clearly.🙄
1336247025474678785 2020-12-08 17:51:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ConspiracyNonce @turkishmerc Oh yeah, so good🙄
1336241010230386690 2020-12-08 17:27:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ConspiracyNonce @turkishmerc So not parody.   To be in my front room I would have invited you.  I would have said something you didn't agree with and you would say your bit and we would engage in debate. I wouldn't throw you out onto the street or turn the radio up.
1336240059520049153 2020-12-08 17:23:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @ConspiracyNonce I quoted the actual definition of free speech Mark. The fact that you cannot absorb it shows only that you are no liberal.
1336224394088222720 2020-12-08 16:21:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @ConspiracyNonce Free speech is "the right to express any opinions without censorship or restraint.".  Drowning booing out is censorship. Banning fans is restraint.  It's an easy concept except where you think you are liberal only to discover that you are not.
1336217856334245889 2020-12-08 15:55:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @SJ141123 I know and people believe that banning fans for booing is ok. Booing fgs.
1336213047191465986 2020-12-08 15:36:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @ConspiracyNonce No you just get banned from going again because you booed. Kind of puts you off expressing freely doesn't it?  Bit like any comedian who is centre right. They are free to perform apparently but venues won't let them perform.  So I think your idea of 'free' and mine is different.
1336212045465853953 2020-12-08 15:32:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Jenny_Nice @BowenBBC Did they miss the impartiality training?
1336210426460319748 2020-12-08 15:26:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @glynmorgan3921 And to kneel or not to kneel.
1336210244465266688 2020-12-08 15:25:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @ConspiracyNonce He is one of my followers and lists parody in his profile.  You do not understand the concept.  You are not 'free' if the consequence is to be punished. Else people in China are free to criticise the government but they will get arrested for it.
1336204364701118465 2020-12-08 15:02:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @ConspiracyNonce If you think that free speech is people sitting on their hands, tight-lipped when they see something they don't agree with going on then yes I have got it wrong Mark.
1336075739918163969 2020-12-08 06:30:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I heard that Dominic Cummings and some journalists are planning to stand outside your door for weeks on end demanding your resignation and an apology. 🙄
1336041399007973377 2020-12-08 04:14:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TangoBravo02 @Mioewing @ColU_Official I knew who you meant👍
1336033755652386823 2020-12-08 03:44:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @0_politics2 The UK had anti discrimination laws before we entered the EC and before most European countries had them.  I say to them,   "Read more. Tweet less".
1336031488928845824 2020-12-08 03:35:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @MichaelBrailsfo Hope you had a lovely day😁
1336031249455046657 2020-12-08 03:34:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @0_politics2 It was back handed so it doesn't count😉
1336031022098632705 2020-12-08 03:33:12 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Resurge888 No, and he's not the only one. Easier to call them all racists than admit they screwed up with imposing kneeling for a marxist organisation. Kick that out of football!
1336030298451177477 2020-12-08 03:30:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @0_politics2 Now that's just plain sensible. Get a grip!
1336027590390378501 2020-12-08 03:19:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @hughbie Ridiculous isn't it. Feels like Brexit where because you voted leave you became a racist end of.
1336026787344748552 2020-12-08 03:16:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ConspiracyNonce Parody I hope.
1336024381450047496 2020-12-08 03:06:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Rangersnomore Too logical I'm afraid.
1336023903165091841 2020-12-08 03:04:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Great idea😁
1336023681802317825 2020-12-08 03:04:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Who'd a thunk it but Jon Snow &amp; Gary Gibbon have done the same😉
1336023282240385027 2020-12-08 03:02:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @rjheathfield 😂 I bet you always pick perfect birthday cards for your friends and family!❤️
1336019284200464384 2020-12-08 02:46:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> OMG it is embarrassing listening to the Chairman of Colchester FC saying that they will drown out any booing and offering to pay back the cost of season tickets if the fan doesn't want to stop booing. WTF happened to freedom of expression. Pardon my abbreviated French😡
1336014289338044419 2020-12-08 02:26:43 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JMPSimor couldn't give a toss about British people.

1336011453850144769 2020-12-08 02:15:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> No idea love I'm British.
1336011142456614912 2020-12-08 02:14:12 +0800 <JustineClaire65> It's definitely a coincidence but both Katya Adler and Sophie Raworth chose EU blue to wear today.

1335649893382316038 2020-12-07 02:18:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> But what about freedom of expression against an extremist political organisation. Or is that not allowed in the fiefdom of John Barnes?  John Barnes' message to fans booing BLM: 'Keep your mouth shut, support your team'  https://t.co/hwZ63fabSG
1335648547153305602 2020-12-07 02:13:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I have always liked Dawn French and I have always been against racism but #BLM is a political organisation who believe white people are the problem and who want to destroy capitalism and defund the police. I'll not be supporting white racism either. I will not be watching.
1335623182963912705 2020-12-07 00:32:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @101Maurice I'm sure she'll be delighted. Don't forget to let us know how it goes😁

1335604542268968960 2020-12-06 23:18:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LBC I hate people like Jane who is white working class and says that all white working class people are too stupid to have read up on #BLM and therefore must be racists for booing. Jesus haven't the white working class got enough to deal with without disrespecting their own.
1335588135431004161 2020-12-06 22:13:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @CharlesAlbertJ2 What are you about?
1335587464216457217 2020-12-06 22:10:40 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LBC A lot of us would have booed had we watched every player kneel in honour of BLM. BLM is an extremist political organisation that hates our society &amp; wants to destroy it, and replace it with some socialist dogs breakfast. I have a right to express my opinion, just like them.
1335569218947964929 2020-12-06 20:58:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @101Maurice Wall art definitely.

1335560915597611008 2020-12-06 20:25:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @gaylejcatlady Well I didn't vote for that. But I have at least always admired Switzerlands determination.
1335560506246041600 2020-12-06 20:23:32 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @elainecoulson58 @LBC Very good point. In the Chelsea game they popped on the BLM banner at the top of the screen for ages.
1335557374636150785 2020-12-06 20:11:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @VinceFranklins @LBC I like that!

1335553341586288642 2020-12-06 19:55:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @FJEB88 @LBC Sorry just had so many remainers debating with me this morning that I'm in aggressive mode😂 I'll have a cup of tea and get in a better place.
1335552868334628864 2020-12-06 19:53:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @gaylejcatlady We are trying to negotiate a FTA if that had escaped your attention. Otherwise WTO rules. That's the plan from our perspective.
1335552384806887425 2020-12-06 19:51:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @FJEB88 @LBC By not listening to stuff you don't make it go away. I listen to a lot of stuff to inform and often confirm my opinions.
1335551991523774465 2020-12-06 19:49:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @HintheUK On what basis do you say that any other country would be able to leave easily. If they have the Euro it will be even more difficult to leave. Almost impossible.  Trite little sayings 🤦🏻‍♀️. If I have a cake I definitely want to eat it🙄  Independent countries have borders. Fact.
1335550685400752129 2020-12-06 19:44:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> OMG @LBC can't believe that people don't have the right to boo a far left organisation. Compulsion to take the knee is wrong. In rugby players seem to have a real choice don't they. People are being cancelled here under a banner of alleged racism. That's so very wrong.
1335541091622408192 2020-12-06 19:06:24 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TPie18 @wisitwippl He will make himself completely unelectable if he does.
1335534176804671489 2020-12-06 18:38:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So it's a club. &amp; when you want to leave that should be really straightforward yeah?  How many names were on the ballot paper when they voted von der Leyen in as EU President?  Was her name even on the shortlist submitted by the EU Parliament for EU President.  Is that democracy?
1335532920325480449 2020-12-06 18:33:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TPie18 @wisitwippl I work in IT so I kind of know how tricky it is to prepare for different scenarios. I get they will have put something in place but it's less than ideal. There will inevitably be a blip or blips after 1st Jan because of 'brexit' but 11th hour crap makes those blips more certain.
1335531448279904257 2020-12-06 18:28:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @HintheUK And they singularly failed. Tell Greece how well they've done in the EU, Italy too. I have genuine respect for a number of the nation states that make up the EU but I do not like the totalitarian EU itself.

1335529856084406273 2020-12-06 18:21:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DanLord78 It does exist. We shouldn't have to ask EU permission to do anything. That's what Independence looks like for those of you without the imagination to visualise it. Our waters, our decision if we want to support our industries, our decision to agree FTA with other countries.

1335326636233936899 2020-12-06 04:54:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @helenmarionvenn @SkySportsNews Equality? Do you mean to support anti racism because the two are very different. Then they should support anti racism not #BLM. And they should make it clear that there is no compulsion to kneel. Like in Rugby Union where a lot don't CHOOSE to.
1335320569907191811 2020-12-06 04:30:07 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @MarcusHodson5 Totally agree, looks like it will turn into a battle.

1335317523324153856 2020-12-06 04:18:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Just watched the beginning of the Chelsea match. When they kneeled there was a lot of clapping, I guess they were told to do that to drown the booing? Anyone know? Then Sky put a #BLM banner on screen for ages next to the score banner. Felt a bit passive-aggressive😁

1334588293409890305 2020-12-04 04:00:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @saxon_angelo It's scarily following an ideology blindly, no matter what the consequence or collateral damage. Any decent person would consider the feelings of the victims and their families rather than boasting that they have signed a letter to let scumbags stay where they are not wanted.
1334586426776752128 2020-12-04 03:52:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @sheriffofknokem @liambyrnemp Was that him?😂
1334584093732974592 2020-12-04 03:43:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Did you write to the victims and their families explaining why this was more important to you than they are?
1334583708536410113 2020-12-04 03:42:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Sorry but he's a rich man what should he do go to McDonald's🙄
1334480746443132931 2020-12-03 20:52:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DavidLammy So will the vaccine be approved in each individual EU country? If so, why have they not done so?
1334478782862909441 2020-12-03 20:45:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Catsnmi @LBC No it isn't.
1334475189460082695 2020-12-03 20:30:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @swishfast @LBC @talkRADIO Nick Ferrari is no lefty, nor Iain Dale but pretty much covers most of the rest😂
1334474666921103364 2020-12-03 20:28:48 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @MoTurn17 @brexit_blue @LBC Just pointing out that I'm not sure the doctor was BAME and often the people whinging for the BAME are the white middle classes. I think most BAME are probably just getting on with their lives.
1334423819663060999 2020-12-03 17:06:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @RobB64632325425 @charlottemilne0 @LBC That was a doctor though. His decisions should be on medical need! A vaccination committee makes the decisions on priorities and roll out. I expect politicians to say ridiculous things but a doctor?
1334422661212987393 2020-12-03 17:02:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @tigersprayer @LBC @talkRADIO I base it on the presenter not the station tbh. I like some on both.
1334419522514808832 2020-12-03 16:49:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lbc @NickFerrariLBC Gavin Williamson bigging up his country is justified. Some of us are sick and tired of this self hate that some politicians, MSM &amp; celebs have. As a country we punch above our weight, not afraid of changing course and a place millions want to live in.
1334240430519701506 2020-12-03 04:58:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @A_Joyful_Cynic @In_A_Flap @LBC Pretty cheap to buy vitamin D.

1334226294637277185 2020-12-03 04:01:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @brown12008 @LBC Because they have been disproportionately affected by Covid apparently😡

1334198187435974659 2020-12-03 02:10:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @saxon_angelo A bit rude 😉

1334192220237426690 2020-12-03 01:46:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Good news about the vaccine though?
1334178819486441472 2020-12-03 00:53:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @fraseringram11 @LBC Absolutely.
1334177065688584199 2020-12-03 00:46:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> OMG - some doctor on @LBC going on about how worried he is that ethnic minorities are not top of the list for a vaccine. Please ffs stop this divisive drivel.  The priorities have been decided based of NEED!
1334173659515195396 2020-12-03 00:32:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I thought @jeremycorbyn was an independent MP because he had the whip removed? Has he been given it back and I missed the U turn?  https://t.co/SV42ndOkz5
1334172550432256008 2020-12-03 00:28:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @libdemdaisy Because you support criminals and not victims and seem very proud of that.
1334170022000865281 2020-12-03 00:18:15 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @gcbjune @LBC Me too😁
1334167596111949825 2020-12-03 00:08:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> It's fun listening to @LBC presenters like Eddie Mair who hate the government struggling with this good news about the vaccine.
1334163203065081858 2020-12-02 23:51:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @anthea_bailey Did she look like Kay Surly as she said it.
1334162780509888513 2020-12-02 23:49:29 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jaycee1001 I think the young (not that he is that young) say that of the old every generation. I know I thought it when I was growing up.   Just that young people think they are open minded and liberal and the older generation have worked out that's not true.
1334160987516268545 2020-12-02 23:42:21 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Pinkladyxxxxx No.
1334147709654216704 2020-12-02 22:49:35 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @mitsyarty Is it a Godless, soulless, vacuous excuse for a human being?
1333880515015880718 2020-12-02 05:07:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @profman60 @DontDareSay That's not what sovereignty means now is it. Sovereignty means that each nation state gets to decide how it does things. It doesn't accept what the unelected politburo says they  must do.  Biting nose off to spite face is one way of doing business I guess.🤷🏻‍♀️
1333876222317768709 2020-12-02 04:50:48 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @profman60 @DontDareSay Oh so can't they decide for themselves if they are Sovereign nations how they deal with foreign people who own second homes? Why should that be a politburo decision?  Glad that you think my vote was so special.   I'm owning my 💩✊🏻
1333874624879357957 2020-12-02 04:44:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Found myself liking Maguire's first tweet and wondered whether I was feeling ok. Then saw the second one and realised what he was scared of. Phew, really thought I was losing it then😂
1333873561442848771 2020-12-02 04:40:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> People accept that they will be turned away from a nightclub for wearing trainers but not that they will be turned away for not having a vaccine.  I'm really not into mandatory vaccines at all but you have to laugh at what people accept and what they get upset about sometimes.
1333872236139323392 2020-12-02 04:34:57 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Define 'good'?
1333870211024515075 2020-12-02 04:26:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @profman60 @DontDareSay No they don't have to. I didn't say they were being vindictive now did I.  I have always paid for holiday insurance and have used it a couple of times. Not been a problem.  You really are scratching around for small nuggets here aren't you.😂
1333864349904105472 2020-12-02 04:03:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @zarahsultana Do you put as much effort into protecting the victims of these criminals?  No didn't think so.
1333838243599683584 2020-12-02 02:19:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @profman60 @DontDareSay I don't have a second home in an EU country so it doesn't impact me or most people tbh. And the EU countries are choosing to do this. They don't have to.
1333516847673700353 2020-12-01 05:02:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> And she said the £500 payments need to be tax free. Why? It's income and it's taxed like we all pay tax.  Just wants Johnson to look like the bad guy. As always.
1333513545712082945 2020-12-01 04:49:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> The police have got themselves in a really dodgy position. If they had treated all protests the same then most of us would support what they are doing but because they haven't it smacks of political and not legal decision making. And they don't ever address this criticism.
1333510995235516417 2020-12-01 04:39:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @sheriffofknokem @AngelaRayner 😂
1333509726164938753 2020-12-01 04:34:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DontDareSay No. If it was a big point of principle I get it but they would do the same as Johnson as there's no real alternative. &amp; saying he acted too late on lockdown 2 doesn't wash when you see where Wales have ended up. And the mass testing that they've been crying about is there too😡
1333507688798547968 2020-12-01 04:26:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Labour the party of gesture politics.
1333503937773711368 2020-12-01 04:11:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Keir_Starmer You have tribal infighting in your own party and racism to sort out. Negative campaigning is not helpful. Tell us more about what you're going to do not what the Conservative Party haven't done. Your party ignored the north and lied about Brexit in 2017 ie honouring the result.
1333502430860947463 2020-12-01 04:05:29 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JamesConlon_ Hello 👋

1333492491329433605 2020-12-01 03:25:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @profman60 @DontDareSay I don't read the Daily Mail. I have no problem with FoM going. Just makes us like every other country in the world bar 27. Open borders just don't work. Immigrants are welcome so long as they have a job or they arrive legally having been vetted as genuine refugees.
1333490593738203142 2020-12-01 03:18:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @davefromglossop And three months out of every six months. So 6 months a year🙄
1333468223669497857 2020-12-01 01:49:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @RevDem No I really did I promise. We are even following each other. I suppose it was a bit fake about me quitting though😁
1333459037464252418 2020-12-01 01:13:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @VioletL33935675 @Crescen21993055 Sounded more mocking than caring to me. Although I may have misinterpreted the tone of the thread.🙄
1333456435909373953 2020-12-01 01:02:43 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @profman60 @DontDareSay Given we haven't effectively left the EU yet I think it would be fair to say that facts are in short supply for both of us.  I think you may struggle a bit with the charm offensive so let's hope that Santa brings you something to cheer your miserableness up.
1333454782221180929 2020-12-01 00:56:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @rjheathfield 😂😂That's what we have all had to do this year. I'm sure Tony will appreciate it!

Interviewer: But the govt has supplied a 48 page impact assessment.  Ed Davey: I haven't had chance to read it but I'm doubtful it will provide the evidence we need.
1333451451625058305 2020-12-01 00:42:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Quelle catastrophe!   Was this all about your second home in Provence Tony?
1333444360000704516 2020-12-01 00:14:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Crescen21993055 Are they doing any harm? So why does it bother you so much?
1333441534004523008 2020-12-01 00:03:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Continued "I ❤️ Boris Johnson. (Nahhh just checking you were reading). I 😡 Boris and JRM for some random reason (I lost interest) I ❤️ the NHS &amp; the extra tax that we get goes to them too. If they vote for independence obvs. Asking the PM to not take tax off the NHS payment"
1333439300436779008 2020-11-30 23:54:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Luckyxmanda My partner voted remain and most of my friends so I know there are lots of lovely people out there. But there are some patronising, nasty pieces of work on Twitter unfortunately.
1333438599015116801 2020-11-30 23:51:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @bbcnews Sturgeon speech:  "We ❤️ the EU I did well with Covid, except for the deaths and the care homes but everyone makes mistakes.

1333433796306350083 2020-11-30 23:32:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DontDareSay To be fair I haven't had much interaction with remainers for ages but suddenly they are back. Can't think why 🙄. I mute the nasty ones. This one was just a decent person with a different opinion. I can do debate with people like him.
1333431032314535936 2020-11-30 23:21:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @c37919235 Oooh good answer. I think the tricky bit is getting your policy past the woke, snowflake senior civil servants who are supposed to work for you. Mind you, how about sacking any like that and appointing normal people😉 I'm on your campaign team Carl, just say the word😂
1333429059863408644 2020-11-30 23:13:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @realgreatbrit Great (Why reinvent the wheel?)

1333427144974856194 2020-11-30 23:06:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Jupiterb1 @simonjgarrett Welcome😁
1333426642631471105 2020-11-30 23:04:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LennieMerrick1 @DontDareSay Awww but that's allowed he's a famous one.
1333426233900675080 2020-11-30 23:02:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @profman60 @DontDareSay But you see I don't need to win you over. I've got what I want.  You need to persuade people like me that I'm wrong so that I may vote differently if there's another referendum in my lifetime.  You need to start a charm offensive Mark😉
1333424474679619589 2020-11-30 22:55:43 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DontDareSay Sounds good to me😂
1333424000245096451 2020-11-30 22:53:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Luckyxmanda My partner is one, and my son would have voted remain had he been old enough. And they are all right most of the time😉  Been ages since I've met one on Twitter that was genuinely interested and didn't come out with the tired old comments.
1333422888897146882 2020-11-30 22:49:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DontDareSay Which ones?

1333412665927086083 2020-11-30 22:08:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @EliKane8 I know what a shocker!
1333401121507905538 2020-11-30 21:22:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Had a very civilised debate with a remainer today. Quitting whilst I'm ahead😉
1333400800387850240 2020-11-30 21:21:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @profman60 @DontDareSay I'm a happy bunny Mark, excited about the future. So my issues don't appear to hamstring me. But if that changes I'll follow my own advice.
1333400203483865088 2020-11-30 21:19:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @101Maurice @Helenmarchant9S I said that!
1333399993399582722 2020-11-30 21:18:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Helenmarchant9S Dust.

1333399347745206274 2020-11-30 21:15:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LennieMerrick1 @DontDareSay Ahh it's American why didn't you say. And seems like you may have been insulting me. I don't think I'll be using that one.
1333398647648694272 2020-11-30 21:13:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LennieMerrick1 @DontDareSay Well that's a bit harsh but I still don't understand it and by just saying it again doesn't really help. Maybe I just paid far too much attention to grammar at school.
1333397918200508416 2020-11-30 21:10:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LennieMerrick1 Doh ... knew that was a weak one.  I was being a little playful but you've gone all jobsworth on me so I'll take my leave😁
1333396496948006917 2020-11-30 21:04:32 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @simonjgarrett @Jupiterb1 And Simon you sound like a genuinely lovely person. Let's catch up and chat about the benefits or disbenefits in the near future.
1333394971584565250 2020-11-30 20:58:29 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Jupiterb1 @simonjgarrett Thanks. What do you do for a living lady?
1333394530947780611 2020-11-30 20:56:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @hall_gregson @inv69489 @Salywebster @alastairdick The world has been dealing with this novel virus outbreak since January 2020.
1333393816074772480 2020-11-30 20:53:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @simonjgarrett @Jupiterb1 I don't like how the EU economic model works with the poor countries supplying cheap labour to the richer countries. It isn't ethical in my opinion.
1333393433000599553 2020-11-30 20:52:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @simonjgarrett @Jupiterb1 The economic argument was not foremost in my mind although I looked into it. I believed that a free trade deal would be possible but didn't perhaps figure how reluctant the EU would be in accepting our decision. Logically it is a win for them too.
1333392124113457155 2020-11-30 20:47:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Jupiterb1 @simonjgarrett Like all projects it's had it's ups &amp; downs &amp; clearly wasn't delivered on time. But looks like we're on track for a 1st Jan delivery.  You find it funny that I mention I'm a PM but this is a project had you not realised that? Benefits realisation being a part of project managemt.
1333391158547001358 2020-11-30 20:43:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @hall_gregson @inv69489 @Salywebster @alastairdick But that quote is not relevant is it. They don't keep doing it over and over. This is a novel virus and this is the first time we have had to deal with  it.
1333390636389715968 2020-11-30 20:41:15 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @simonjgarrett @Jupiterb1 I am a Project Manager and know that benefits cannot be realised and proven until after the change has happened. My reason for voting leave was because I do not like the centralist, federalist direction of travel of the EU. I am a democrat &amp; the EU is not democratic.
1333389194589315072 2020-11-30 20:35:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Jupiterb1 @simonjgarrett No I don't answer that question because we do not realise benefits until after we are properly out. Nothing's changed yet so I can't list benefits. Your friend Simon seemed to understand this when he said he'd debate it next year. Any benefit I state cannot be proved can it?
1333388049942802433 2020-11-30 20:30:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Jupiterb1 @simonjgarrett That was not a stereotype. I literally did not understand the last sentence and he is an alien.
1333387264655716353 2020-11-30 20:27:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Jupiterb1 @simonjgarrett And what about your intolerance and bigotry. Nothing to say for yourself?
1333387012603322368 2020-11-30 20:26:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Jupiterb1 @simonjgarrett You really are a disappointment with that old chestnut. And I was expecting better from a Lady.
1333386465221496832 2020-11-30 20:24:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Jupiterb1 @simonjgarrett No it was a feeble stereotype. Labelling a person who doesn't see the world the way you do a nutter is a sign of intolerance and bigotry. I'm just used to more of a discussion before the tin hat finale.
1333383246227386371 2020-11-30 20:11:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @RDave65 @simonjgarrett Doom and gloom ... oh and Nissan say they have no intention of closing but hey why let the truth get in the way of your sad narrative😥
1333382669921640450 2020-11-30 20:09:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Jupiterb1 @simonjgarrett Oh dear ... back to the usual nah nah nah nah nah 🥱🥱
1333381939173220354 2020-11-30 20:06:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @0_politics2 And mass compliance ... or else 🥶
1333381554312278019 2020-11-30 20:05:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Jupiterb1 @simonjgarrett Such an optimistic bunch aren't you.  I'm concerned about the sky falling in😂

1333376347771695107 2020-11-30 19:44:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LennieMerrick1 @DontDareSay "But you do you"? I know you're an alien but the punchline got lost in translation.
1333375827220848642 2020-11-30 19:42:24 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LennieMerrick1 Would the idea to leave the EU not count? Asking for a friend.
1333375158325809153 2020-11-30 19:39:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Oh so it's the Tories rather than Labour leading by example on pay restraint.  But given Labour believe there is a magic money tree I suppose that's not surprising. Just disappointing. As always.
1333372628359405569 2020-11-30 19:29:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @profman60 @DontDareSay That such bitterness exists is a shame. That people can hold different views and be lambasted is just a sign of the intolerance that exists amongst #FPBEs.  Mark there are good counsellors out there who can help you work through your issues.
1333371217584287746 2020-11-30 19:24:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @simonjgarrett Absolutely. It's a deal.
1333370903548358656 2020-11-30 19:22:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @PhotoGu19646088 None whatsoever. But there is evidence that in the polls that count ie the referendum, the GEs in 2017 &amp; 2019 and the EU elections in 2019. The majority kept choosing leave. The one Grayling chooses to believe is the small poll quoted which just shows how ridiculous he is.
1333369205312409600 2020-11-30 19:16:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @simonjgarrett Nah ... that's just wishful thinking by those who never accept the result of the proper polls ie where everyone gets an opportunity to vote, like the referendum and the GEs since the referendum. Oh and the EU elections.
1333368314001825792 2020-11-30 19:12:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Collioure6 Yes please do. I joined Twitter to talk about Brexit and happy to pick up and review how its going.
1333367876288475136 2020-11-30 19:10:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @01ivi3r1u6 @DontDareSay @PhilipHunn1 He blocked you because he tired of your bullying &amp; bigotry. It must be difficult for you to accept that you hold the minority view &amp; that you lost in repeated ballots to people you regard as intellectually inferior.  Yet we have left the EU. So who is the fool?  Muted.
1333144467533127688 2020-11-30 04:23:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @SaltyDuchess @Nigel100007 Got done by them once for saying I can always take my holiday to another part of the UK where I'd be welcome. That's when there was a sad little contingent of nats guarding the border. Very aggressive bunch. The Irish got me for questioning Biden's Irish credentials once too😁
1333143157215813634 2020-11-30 04:17:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @hytheskeptik @P4triQt Hmm ... and I say codswallop😁

1333129671874142208 2020-11-30 03:24:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @SaltyDuchess You have moments where you begin to wonder especially when they come after you in packs😁
1333129412351582212 2020-11-30 03:23:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @SaltyDuchess @car_cctv And me. And Covid doesn't neatly split on Brexit lines does it? So you find some of your loyal Brexiters also believe that Boris has turned into Ming the Merciless over Covid.😢
1333128698472652800 2020-11-30 03:20:24 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @P4triQt Errr .. he caught Covid and then needed time to recover?
1333127349664165888 2020-11-30 03:15:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DontDareSay 😂 Exactly.
1333127200544002048 2020-11-30 03:14:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @SimpleSoul10 @avds But it isn't about just reduced cases is it. Does it surprise you that there are reduced cases when we are in a LOCKDOWN. They don't reduce once we open up do they, they increase.  It is also about cases in hospitals that serve that locality. Plus other factors.
1333125586747875328 2020-11-30 03:08:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JamesWa46096370 @car_cctv @SaltyDuchess Not sure that's true tbh.
1333125449568940033 2020-11-30 03:07:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @car_cctv @talkRADIO Yeah, I'm struggling with TalkRadio and LBC at the moment as they seem so anti govt. I never voted for this govt but I want Brexit and I feel they have dealt with Covid in a similar way to other Western countries. Can't stand the total negativity.
1333124523315654657 2020-11-30 03:03:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @car_cctv @SaltyDuchess Yes, I've thought that since 2016 when the great schism was fully revealed.
1333124006011150337 2020-11-30 03:01:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Ever think people are just winding the pollsters up so that they can see saddos like you retweet in desperation😂
1333123315083390979 2020-11-30 02:59:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @SaltyDuchess I'm having issues with the remainers who are getting a bit angry. Had a few similar issues with some anti lockdown people too. I rarely block but I must have muted half a dozen over the last few days.
1333121102562926592 2020-11-30 02:50:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @artisian47 Only he's American but I get your point.
1333120682746650628 2020-11-30 02:48:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DontDareSay I'm with you Samuel, I think there's a lot of us out there just we get a bit closed down on Twitter.
1333116395765321730 2020-11-30 02:31:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ChloP120611 Doh ...
1333106280987291649 2020-11-30 01:51:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Just why don't you police all protests in lockdown like this.@MetPoliceEvents
1333105506353819649 2020-11-30 01:48:15 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Burden asking how Sturgeon hasn't be held to account for Covid deaths in care homes and failing to produce information for the Salmond enquiry. Who is it that holds politicians to account? The media?  So the question might be why has the media not held Sturgeon to account? 🤔
1333102766626050055 2020-11-30 01:37:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @johnredwood They will get poorly themselves and it is staff that we need as much as beds.

1333101302168088576 2020-11-30 01:31:32 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Marisol04326417 @alastairdick @Salywebster Oh I just don't buy any of this controlling malarkey. Johnson is a proper libertarian. It doesn't make any sense at all. He's having to impose things because of this pandemic that goes against every instinct he has. And I'm not a Tory as you probably know.
1333086713518952453 2020-11-30 00:33:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Really interesting stuff. Good to know the media and institutions have always censored stuff🤨
1333083889955459073 2020-11-30 00:22:21 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @anthea_bailey Sickening if that works. It didn't work for Labour Party in Dec 2019 did it.
1333083649537929219 2020-11-30 00:21:24 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @OnOurWayOut @BorisJohnson @TaylorOBE Yes we are.
1333073464551485440 2020-11-29 23:40:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ghost_wales I think you can support the police whilst pointing out their inconsistent approach to protests. I support the police just not always senior management.
1333072732301500419 2020-11-29 23:38:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Salywebster @alastairdick I support him, acknowledging mistakes have been made, and I didn't vote for him.
1333072526868672512 2020-11-29 23:37:12 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Salywebster @alastairdick No country has successfully locked up their vulnerable people and let everyone else loose, relying on herd immunity. No, not even Sweden. For every signature on that declaration there is a scientist that disagrees. Most countries are doing a version of what we are doing.
1333071381785960449 2020-11-29 23:32:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @OnOurWayOut @BorisJohnson @TaylorOBE I have a life it's just not full of bitterness like yours. And that has nothing to do with whether he cares about what happened to Damilola does it?
1333069676939796481 2020-11-29 23:25:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Salywebster @alastairdick Sage is made up of over 50 professionals from all different specialisms. He's not doing anything very different from any other leader in Europe is he? Just a lot of people want to see the back of him for other reasons it seems to me.
1333068111059312641 2020-11-29 23:19:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Salywebster @alastairdick Mistakes are mistakes Sally. He is being accused of all sorts of bad stuff, deliberate stuff. I'm happy that the truth be told but for now we have a pandemic to be dealing with and Brexit.
1333067285062443008 2020-11-29 23:16:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @OnOurWayOut @BorisJohnson @TaylorOBE What the hell do you know. Nasty piece of work.
1333061526433968133 2020-11-29 22:53:29 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Distrust in institutions that govern us started in earnest with their lack of acceptance of the result of the 2016 referendum.  We were broken for years before Covid. It shouldn't come as a surprise.
1333060533667434498 2020-11-29 22:49:32 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @MARCHANTK They won't do that whatever because we have had 10 years of austerity since the last global crisis.
1333060169064992769 2020-11-29 22:48:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @enoughoftheSNP Ok I just didn't get the kids in jail bit.
1333059942501191684 2020-11-29 22:47:12 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @flossycat100 Raab hadn't been caught out in a lie though had he.
1333058682490392581 2020-11-29 22:42:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @MARCHANTK We can't instantly pay back but there is still a consequence.
1333047077300039680 2020-11-29 21:56:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @MARCHANTK The more we give away the bigger the tab at the end. The tax payer has to pay for this eventually.
1333046600864817153 2020-11-29 21:54:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LBC Maajid you made short shrift of Susan there. You basically just said that Covid was nothing to most people so a shrugging of your shoulders. Most people know vulnerable people and so they should care.  You haven't your facts to hand and you are quite dangerously ignorant.
1333044903677489154 2020-11-29 21:47:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @MARCHANTK No you may not be saying that but many others are.   There will inevitably be economic issues and I can't believe that anyone would think otherwise. It is as if people are saying that there is some way of managing this with no bad consequences. It's a pandemic fgs.
1333037876641198080 2020-11-29 21:19:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LBC There is a huge gap in trust in institutions like the media, govt, parliament, the police, the courts. Not caused by Covid Maajid. This distrust was caused by those institutions not accepting the result of the 2016 referendum and trying to overturn it.
1333033687127101444 2020-11-29 21:02:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ccartist Agreed.
1333033589383045127 2020-11-29 21:02:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @realcalpol @sarahisitme I can't see Sarah's tweet.
1333032787092377604 2020-11-29 20:59:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @MARCHANTK No, being too restrictive.
1333032529515962373 2020-11-29 20:58:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @enoughoftheSNP Look poor kids already have a tough time so I have no problem with my tax money being spent on them getting fed for free whilst at school. Or to provide a safety net for people who have fallen on hard times. Or for social services to look after those with negligent parents.
1333031774172098560 2020-11-29 20:55:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @NinkyMama Also when you decide that you are not going down a formal procurement route (because everyone would be dead or vaccinated by the time that completes) you go down a different route. Then it's who you know and I guess people in their positions know people.
1333030914654400519 2020-11-29 20:51:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @NinkyMama So because we have one potential waste of money that means we should waste even more money🤔
1333016969709293568 2020-11-29 19:56:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jesusWe64631245 No they are already separated and this system has worked for decades very effectively. It's based on parental income. Works fine.
1333016559707713540 2020-11-29 19:54:48 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @welsh_mountie Blatant. But it's like the Corbyn Labour Party spend, spend, spend manifesto. We didn't fall for that though.
1333016230417080325 2020-11-29 19:53:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @welsh_mountie I've always been a bit awkward.
1333015952145997825 2020-11-29 19:52:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @REP57910897 @MrsP89998 Oh no I don't think kids should get free school meals when they are not in school. So the schools are open and the poor kids are fed for free.
1333015293782855680 2020-11-29 19:49:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DangerM79219248 @clive37470864 @Heaven2hell54 I know all these people slagging Johnson off and then when they ask would you rather have Starmer they say 'no, definitely not'.
1333012210541621249 2020-11-29 19:37:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @RightOh1995 I agree.
1333012122587058178 2020-11-29 19:37:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @colking @sarahisitme @realcalpol Me too.
1332999388109664257 2020-11-29 18:46:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jesusWe64631245 Poor children do and nobody is questioning that. I'm questioning why we should pay for well off children to have breakfast. Most people can and do feed their children. But you know what I'm saying you just don't like to hear it.
1332998233904189440 2020-11-29 18:41:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AgeingGardener @flossycat100 @PeterStefanovi2 Whataboutery. Let's look at her right now. We are constantly reminded to look at Johnson for every single thing we don't like. And I'm no Tory.
1332997809428180998 2020-11-29 18:40:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @REP57910897 @MrsP89998 It was meant to bring the main benefits together under one umbrella and I think that makes sense. I believe that poor children should get free school meals. Most children do not come from poor families and do not need that benefit. So let's leave it alone.
1332997173814976512 2020-11-29 18:37:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Annlacy7 Me too. I think because she had lied to him when he last interview her.
1332997009058488320 2020-11-29 18:37:07 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @HilaryJFCMA @LarraineWright1 I support the police in principle but they need to be held to account if they become political. They should treat us all the same without fear or favour.
1332996419523895297 2020-11-29 18:34:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @I_Kermit The statistics were death per million. Doesn't matter how many people you are talking about.
1332995949321392133 2020-11-29 18:32:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @dan63uk I thought so too. But credit where credit's due.

1332995343462641664 2020-11-29 18:30:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AgeingGardener @flossycat100 @PeterStefanovi2 I do believe that. Hard to stomach when he goes in hard on the people you support isn't it? Much more tolerable when it's the people you don't like getting the grilling.
1332994928809549829 2020-11-29 18:28:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AgeingGardener Truth is that the public sector struggle to set systems up quickly. The private sector are often so much quicker. Speed was essential. And you do need a central approach which links into local 'knock the door' expertise. Looks like the join between the two could have been better.
1332994144600551427 2020-11-29 18:25:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @PaulBre16303821 I think your charm should get you a second referendum.
1332993703561064448 2020-11-29 18:23:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @REP57910897 @MrsP89998 Child Benefit is an old benefit in a world where women either didn't work or didn't earn much. Now if you earn a lot you can stop receiving it if you choose. Lots of people still rely on it though. UC does pull about 6 benefits into one but it doesn't include all.
1332992239522471937 2020-11-29 18:18:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @flossycat100 He went harder in on Sturgeon because he believes he has caught her out in two lies. One about care homes and one about Salmond. If he had caught any politician out with blatant lies then I would expect the same from #marr.
1332990515193786370 2020-11-29 18:11:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @SeparatistVegan @NicolaSturgeon Sorry did you mean, "Is it now?".
1332990307047247873 2020-11-29 18:10:29 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Nigel100007 @PaulBre16303821 I know it is so laughable when they say that😁
1332990085046935553 2020-11-29 18:09:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @bethcubs @BBCPolitics FGS you don't take a job like that if you are thin skinned.   If you think that's bullying you have led a really sheltered life.
1332989545210671109 2020-11-29 18:07:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Lots of Whataboutery going on after the Sturgeon interview. He wasn't being rude he was holding her to account by presenting statistics and a fairly damning clip of her denying any previous knowledge of Salmond's alleged behaviour. That's his job, glad to see him do that. #marr
1332988637512916994 2020-11-29 18:03:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @notmyconcern @AndrewMarr9 Yes, and how did he do with Sturgeon. Looks like she's been telling a few porkies doesn't it.
1332988272373608449 2020-11-29 18:02:24 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @bethcubs @BBCPolitics Being held to account is what leaders should expect.
1332987897159577601 2020-11-29 18:00:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @SeparatistVegan @NicolaSturgeon Same tone he uses with Boris Johnson and other leaders?
1332987661955571724 2020-11-29 17:59:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Annlacy7 #marr is holding Sturgeon to account for saying she knew nothing about Salmond's behaviour before it became public. Now it seems a matter of public record that she knew 6 months before. She reacted like she had been caught out.
1332986720128819202 2020-11-29 17:56:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Annlacy7 She's not saying much.
1332986610653278209 2020-11-29 17:55:48 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Annlacy7 Just doing that now.
1332985665294884870 2020-11-29 17:52:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> #marr Provided statistics showing Scotland's death rates are worse than England's.   Sturgeon's reply, "Scotland is doing better than England".  Deaths in care homes worse in Scotland than England.  Sturgeon's reply, "Scotland is doing better than England".  Sorted🙄
1332983954169847815 2020-11-29 17:45:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @NorthernTory79 No, never surprising that party politics interferes with common purpose.#marr
1332981844833349632 2020-11-29 17:36:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Usual high level of debate from Femi #marr
1332979401768767488 2020-11-29 17:27:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Nandy makes no sense. She keeps saying the test, trace &amp; isolate system is not working. When in reality what is not working is people picking up their phones and isolating. Of course with Labour people are never to blame, always the system or the govt. #marr
1332977675036749824 2020-11-29 17:20:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Nandy doesn't think Johnson is doing enough 🙄 lots of people think he's doing too much 🙄. Jeez who'd be the PM at this moment in history! #marr
1332976425712939008 2020-11-29 17:15:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> That is just a waste of money providing free breakfast and lunch to all primary school children! I would like my tax money spent on people in need not feeding well off people's children. #marr
1332975571849138180 2020-11-29 17:11:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @nixim7 @dwilliam9940 I respect your view and if this was only happening in this country I may share it. But this is happening across large parts of the world. I don't believe it is a hoax. But I guess only time will tell.
1332972683756236801 2020-11-29 17:00:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @nixim7 @dwilliam9940 I'm not an anti lockdown protester. I obviously don't like lockdowns but I understand why we have them and I follow the rules. I don't think anyone should be protesting during a pandemic that's anti lockdown, BLM &amp; XR. I just don't like the police treating people differently.
1332968452630466563 2020-11-29 16:43:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @YorksBrie1648 @Maggypye1 @AnnBank41695841 @jaycee1001 Like what you did there! Let's hope he's not😁

1332762446885478404 2020-11-29 03:05:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @theroyaleditor And your point?
1332743179880292352 2020-11-29 01:48:29 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @NeilView It has.
1332742994139688960 2020-11-29 01:47:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> There are legal processes that these people have &amp; lots of lawyers to help if they have a case.  You are obstructing the law by trying to bully airlines into not taking these flights.  Personally I prefer the murderers and rapists back in their own countries. Call me harsh.
1332740777546485765 2020-11-29 01:38:57 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AberystwythCar Definitely the Capri.
1332731498550730755 2020-11-29 01:02:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> But why do you treat other groups that protest differently. I am not anti restrictions but you tolerate XR and BLM and it just feels like there's one law for the left and another for what you perceive as the right. So people don't respect you for that.
1332729622434357257 2020-11-29 00:54:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JonBandell I'm on the side of the Tory Party here not the BBC who are not reporting divisions in the Labour Party.

1332720642093944835 2020-11-29 00:18:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @BBCNews are just loving this division in the Conservative Party.

1332674947001573379 2020-11-28 21:17:21 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lbc Maajid I remember when the govt went into the first lockdown and Witty for one pointed out all of the disbenefits of going into lockdown. Do you really think that it takes a radio talk show host to point this out to people?
1332646917277446149 2020-11-28 19:25:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jaycee1001 I voted Brexit and wanted that referendum for years. I do not regret that decision, I feel just the same as I have always done.  I am concerned about any compromise for fishing. I hope Boris holds his nerve.
1332646198629584896 2020-11-28 19:23:07 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @mattfrei &amp; Ken Clarke talking about brexit on @lbc.   We should stop trying to destroy the French fishing industry apparently.🤷🏻‍♀️  Just over a month to go🥂
1332640820802056194 2020-11-28 19:01:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @mattfrei @LBC Young people go to gyms. Gyms keep you healthy and we are too sedentary. Obese people are vulnerable to Covid. That's maybe why gyms are more important to open before restaurants?
1332634250378620928 2020-11-28 18:35:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @mattfrei @LBC You do realise that the Covid mortality rates for Belgium, Italy &amp; Spain are higher than the UK don't you? Just you always make it sound like the UK is the worse in Europe. And even Germany has struggled with this second wave. Not fit your narrative Matt?
1332626076783284224 2020-11-28 18:03:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WinterfellT They are just used to having it their way.
1332624347513622529 2020-11-28 17:56:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Oh so talking about white privilege, trying to create mass white guilt, destroying symbols of Britain's past and mass kneeling has caused division. Who'd a thunk it?  Black Lives Matter has increased racial tension, 55% say in UK poll  https://t.co/XgDZMsI3mV

1332282629991886848 2020-11-27 19:18:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So I'm a bit bored of the favourite subject on your show which seems to be slag off the govt for their complete incompetence. To make it slightly more interesting can you say what you would do? And consider if once your approach goes wrong what your Plan B would be? @LBC

1332255439891951621 2020-11-27 17:30:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> There must be a cut off for the end of talks with the EU. I thought the outcome of the talks was to be brought back to the HOC? When?

Parliament put names forward and NONE of them was on the ballot sheet. The ONLY name on the ballot sheet was Ursula's. No one explained. Then she only just scraped through😁Absolute farce and there's no defence of that. Surely?
1332047631237992449 2020-11-27 03:44:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @houldall @01ivi3r1u6 @cambschris @bromhome @Aitchworld @jennynorthern21 @JoelBaccas Look what happened in Dec 2019. A Tory govt had been in power through austerity for 10 yrs. In any normal election they would have been out on their ear. But because the Tory party was the only party who promised to honour the 2016 ref result they got another 5 years. It works.

The govt is generally made up from one party that has a majority. The party chooses a leader and that is the PM. If the govt are crap I get to vote them out. I never get the chance to vote anyone in any position of power out of the EU. Nobody does.

1331917760054616064 2020-11-26 19:08:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @wontytump My sister is a care home cleaner and she had access to PPE throughout. It was a very mixed bag with care homes. My sister gave up her other cleaning jobs so that she didn't spread Covid to the care home. She chose to lose money for her principles. Lots of unsung heroes out there.
1331916935202791424 2020-11-26 19:05:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Mickey58630673 @teresadg0 You should have stuck with it as there was one scene with the queen and Thatcher which summed up the respect she was held in. The Crown is fairly even handed in its approach to characters of the time I think. And it is an interpretation not necessarily the truth.
1331914495560708097 2020-11-26 18:55:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TonyBlows @janeteddy22 Happy birthday😁

1331912389357342725 2020-11-26 18:47:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jaycee1001 Oh so sorry to hear that😢

If they take holiday they don't get paid.  I do appreciate the fantastic job that lots of people do but it is annoying when one group (teacher unions) think their members deserve more.
1331908499517960192 2020-11-26 18:31:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @fransoi29 @bromhome @cambschris @Aitchworld @jennynorthern21 @JoelBaccas Yes, no visa if you are going on holiday.
1331908257636610049 2020-11-26 18:30:48 +0800 <JustineClaire65> We all know that some companies used the furlough scheme sensibly but then turned a profit better than expected. So how about @RishiSunak  asks for them to make a 'voluntary' contribution back to the Treasury. Then give them a shout out.
1331907194212798465 2020-11-26 18:26:35 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @MoTurn17 @Boristhespider0 Yes, I feel sure that some companies will have used the furlough scheme when they shouldn't have. Or should pay back if they made more profit than they expected like The Spectator did.

Hard luck for losing but you can accept it and move on, or keep crying like a brat. I'm thinking I know where you will go😂  Muted.

Black, blue, grey, green, white. You are an absolute noodle who can't ever back down like a child😂.  Muted.
1331904522520834052 2020-11-26 18:15:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @plumbjulie74 Yes, I'm one who has worked throughout and whilst very grateful to have my job it has been exhausting picking up the slack as you say with no proper holiday/break.

The colour of the sky is not a good example of a fact given it can appear to be different colours on different occasions🙄
1331902603278635008 2020-11-26 18:08:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Dengiehammer @gsboutout @inacentre Given I started this thread😁 I was pointing out that it was not just public sector staff who worked in front line jobs. No mention of the NHS. It was a reaction to teacher unions complaining. Just to set the record straight.

The majority of people don't think this way that's why they showed their appreciation in massive numbers every week. I know NHS staff didn't ask for that but that was ordinary people saying thank you.

As you say a lot of people showed their gratitude. Let's just not imply that it is only public sector staff who helped and who deserve a pay rise.

They just should not be treated better in this current situation. They should not forget the vital work of the private sector. It's not a them and us.

And you people fought tooth and nail against that democratic decision. Rather like Trump is doing now.  Scotland had a referendum in 2014. They chose to stay as I remember.

1331657081674493953 2020-11-26 01:52:43 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @bromhome @Argyll1872 @PhotoGu19646088 @EUsouEuropa @JoelBaccas Because you cannot prove any disbenefits and I cannot prove any benefits until we have properly left. You would be speculating as much as me. All discussion is fatuous without evidence. Come back when there is evidence, caused by Brexit, and we'll have a discussion.

He's saving for a deposit for a house with his girlfriend now they both have jobs so this money that he/we paid for nothing would have moved him closer to that.

He's got a good job now though through all of this stuff and is really positive as he's always been. Just sickened me how money grabbing and uncaring the Unis have become.

That isn't the fault of those people who are happy to take the vaccine though is it.  Take your grievance out on the government not people who just want to get their lives back.

Shut the Uni but made him pay the whole term 3 rent when he couldn't live there. The NUS did nothing and the uni sold the debt to a debt collection agency so he paid. Well we paid😡

He got his membership back without even having to apologise. So he wasn't punished.
1330538714058137601 2020-11-22 23:48:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jpearcejourno @murn1 I don't think Corbyn has been punished. He got to say sorry, not sorry and was allowed back as a member, he's still an MP. She said sorry and is supposed to lose her ministerial job.  What he did was allow structural racism. There is no comparison.

1330534403857113093 2020-11-22 23:31:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jpearcejourno @murn1 Oh you are so quick to judge, but good to know you are consistent. I am allowed to question why so much more is made of one thing and not the other when they both happened in the same week. And in my day you backed up your argument with examples and that's what I was doing.
1330524449389621256 2020-11-22 22:52:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jpearcejourno @murn1 I just thought I'd check what you tweeted about Corbyn. Couldn't find anything. Do you not have a view on racism in the Labour Party or did I not look hard enough.  You see I find it interesting what people don't talk about as well as what they do.
1330520502385987585 2020-11-22 22:36:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jpearcejourno @murn1 👍
1330519198112636932 2020-11-22 22:31:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jpearcejourno @murn1 We do not agree and will not so there isn't much point in going around in circles.   Have a good rest of your day.
1330516544070307846 2020-11-22 22:20:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jpearcejourno @murn1 Let's get something completely straight here. You don't know me so let me tell you that I am 55 yrs old &amp; I have never voted Tory. This is a fight for our democracy that has been going on since 2016 &amp; continues. I'll support people who are doing their job not the anti democrats.
1330510611164393473 2020-11-22 21:57:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Crosscolin88 It's lovely😁
1330510357840982017 2020-11-22 21:56:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jpearcejourno @murn1 No it doesn't. You are right there is a strict code in dealing with the civil servants that's why the one who incorrectly briefed Amber Rudd for which she felt compelled to resign is still there.😂
1330509775373733898 2020-11-22 21:53:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @HelenBarbaraSmi Moved on from calling people unintelligent then🙄
1330509107128897542 2020-11-22 21:51:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jpearcejourno @murn1 If you believe that this is simply about bullying then you are naive. This is about an elected govt being obstructed from delivering their manifesto by a group of senior civil servants who have forgotten who they are paid to serve. The 'bullying' is a symptom of that disease.
1330469186779410433 2020-11-22 19:12:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jpearcejourno @murn1 Yes, and I also believe in fairness and giving people second chances. There was a lot more in that report that isn't being focussed on. The behaviour of some civil servants towards her was also mentioned which is why I assume Johnson does not believe she should go.
1330466662806659073 2020-11-22 19:02:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jpearcejourno @murn1 She has apologised and her boss wants her to stay. The constant insistence on her leaving is bullying. Just people can't accept that. Perhaps she thought the same.
1330465803188178944 2020-11-22 18:59:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc Oh I get it Mark. You prefer to see a Tory head on a stick rather than a Labour head. Even though one 'crime' is far worse than the other.  I do understand your position Mark. It's my position you are struggling with.
1330464261374611456 2020-11-22 18:52:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @nigelbates14 The EHRC is available to examine that, only there is no evidence. They looked at Labour because there was evidence. See how it works?
1330463856716615680 2020-11-22 18:51:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @EthicalDarby I'd rather not. I'm not a Tory, I just don't like hypocrisy. Nothing ethical about trying to humiliate is there @EthicalDarby
1330463445825806338 2020-11-22 18:49:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Anonylyzer13 @EliKane8 Real shouting and swearing, yes.
1330463261557403651 2020-11-22 18:48:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AndrewW71128479 Real shouting and swearing.
1330463077981106177 2020-11-22 18:48:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @murn1 @jpearcejourno Well it was. You may think she deserves that but I was in a thread yesterday where her behaviour was compared to Adolf Hitler. I guess social media bullying doesn't count?
1330461900228980736 2020-11-22 18:43:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc Thanks.   Correction: Tackling racism is always more important than tackling shouting and swearing.😁
1330451867474784258 2020-11-22 18:03:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> To be fair #marr pushed Dodds on racism a lot harder than he pushed Sunak on bullying. Which is absolutely as it should be. Actual racism should trump alleged bullying in any decent world.
1330449849284751368 2020-11-22 17:55:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @sophiabotha74 Starve to death🙄
1330449201977827329 2020-11-22 17:53:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @murn1 @jpearcejourno Sorry is that sarcasm?
1330448907088891904 2020-11-22 17:51:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @EthicalDarby No it's not bullying you are right, it's just getting us to judge a person by their appearance rather than what they say and do. Which isn't ethical is it?
1330447951303495685 2020-11-22 17:48:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jpearcejourno Yes as part of the newspaper review #marr
1330447569605029888 2020-11-22 17:46:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @johnholden42 @AndrewMarr9 Yes straight from Trotsky to Johnson, what a journey😂
1330447362448355329 2020-11-22 17:45:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @EthicalDarby You have ethical in your name. Just wondering why with a comment like that? #marr
1330446103410585601 2020-11-22 17:40:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Yes concentrating on ACTUAL racism rather than ACTUAL bullying what terrible bias🙄 #marr
1330442421516324864 2020-11-22 17:26:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Many4Opposition Did racism in the party increase on his watch? Because if it did then he's responsible. That's how it works in the real world. If this had happened in the Tory Party you'd have them all in Nazi uniforms and you know it. So please do not talk about Patel's hypocrisy. #marr
1330439454771834881 2020-11-22 17:14:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Many4Opposition Sorry so the findings of the EHRC wasn't using facts? #Marr
1330438774631829505 2020-11-22 17:11:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Many4Opposition Let's get this right Corbyn allows racism to grow within his party. Resulting in proper racism against MPs and members. It gets found to be shamefully true by the EHRC. He downplays the findings and then gets readmitted to the party without so much as an apology🤔 #marr
1330435995058253824 2020-11-22 17:00:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> In the week that saw Corbyn readmitted to the Labour Party for downplaying the findings of the EHRC racism report without so much as an apology. And Patel accused of bullying. Which one will be given centre stage? #marr  Alleged bullying or actual racism?🤔
1330249258809831424 2020-11-22 04:38:32 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @RuleBrexitannia No.

1330182548027215881 2020-11-22 00:13:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WarriorBrexit I don't know her so cannot really say what she's like tbf. No more than you.  I don't like blood sports and that's what it feels like. And I am very uncomfortable with demonising brown skinned women and leaving the real proven bullies alone. Call me odd.
1330179256421330944 2020-11-22 00:00:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WarriorBrexit I'm not distracting from Patel I'm expanding on the discussion and giving some context. Some of you are turning her into a demon and I have to wonder why because she's not as bad as many other people who you don't want me to mention to back up my argument.
1330177922024550402 2020-11-21 23:55:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @NickOsb2010 It won't be 2 hours it's just the usual fear mongering. I've only ever had to wait that length of time at Gatwick😁
1330165431718604801 2020-11-21 23:05:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Oh like the questions we get asked if we go to Australia or the US. I see. Those two hour waits🙄

Oh and his party not found guilty of racism. Funny topsy turvy world isn't it. Where words seem so much more offensive than actual racism to you.

1330118941755240451 2020-11-21 20:00:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @WarriorBrexit @CornockStehen @Keir_Starmer @pritipatel I'm trying to look at it properly and from all angles. You quoted 3 departments, there were 2. One of her senior Civil Servants was the same one who didn't brief Rudd correctly. Rudd resigned because of his mistake. No action taken against him. Facts are annoying little fellows.
1330117772928540674 2020-11-21 19:56:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jaycee1001 Or Bercow? Or Brown?
1330117621627367428 2020-11-21 19:55:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> In all my years of working I have become suspicious of those who write really long sentences without any commas because when they do it usually results in even longer nonsensical sentences which people feel compelled to laugh at.
1330116908113408003 2020-11-21 19:52:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @WarriorBrexit @CornockStehen @Keir_Starmer @pritipatel It wasn't across 3 departments. They looked at 3 departments &amp; two of them were problematic. Overseas Aid &amp; the Home Office. Both full of civil servants who have become politicised and obstructive. I don't know whether I support her style but I think I understand her frustration.
1330115399162191873 2020-11-21 19:46:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @WarriorBrexit @CornockStehen @Keir_Starmer @pritipatel What I see is a woman who was elected to do a job &amp; is being hamstrung by people who are paid to work for her. The report detailed that the civil servants acted against her but that hasn't come out. The same civil servants who briefed Amber R badly &amp; led to her to resignation.
1330113932208578562 2020-11-21 19:40:48 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @WarriorBrexit @CornockStehen @Keir_Starmer @pritipatel People who forget stories that happened more than a day ago.

Not good judgement was it.  I'll believe Starmer is serious if he refuses to give the whip back permanently. Rather than waiting until people like you forget about the story.
1330106760745586698 2020-11-21 19:12:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @WarriorBrexit @CornockStehen @Keir_Starmer @pritipatel You like dipping back into intelligence don't you Mark. I am intelligent so you don't need to worry about that.  I don't swear much, I don't shout much. That's who I am as a person and as a manager. I discuss and reason. But then I understand that we are not all the same.

This story happened this week too. Frei has a weekly show as I say.
1330105394866360321 2020-11-21 19:06:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @WarriorBrexit @CornockStehen @Keir_Starmer @pritipatel It really doesn't mean you have independent thought. Or did I miss your tweets on the anti semitism story? Which is still ongoing and really important.
1330104880237862915 2020-11-21 19:04:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @WarriorBrexit @CornockStehen @Keir_Starmer @pritipatel Not the top news story and I think that you should take some of the advice you are offering Patel.   Sweary and shouty is vile behaviour isn't it Mark?
1330104364992782341 2020-11-21 19:02:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @WarriorBrexit @CornockStehen @Keir_Starmer @pritipatel No talk about this as it's a story but not the main story. @mattfrei @lbc is a weekly show and Corbyn was readmitted to the Labour Party this week. Get it?   Or can your brain only retain the last story it processed?
1330103366693818368 2020-11-21 18:58:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @WarriorBrexit @CornockStehen @Keir_Starmer @pritipatel I'm not ignoring this, I'm reprioritising it. I think dealing with anti semitism in a mainstream party is more important.  Because ignoring anti semitism doesn't tend to end well. If people like you would rather talk about hurty feelings than racism then it says a lot about you.

It may be delusional expecting the actual story of the day being discussed I suppose.🙄
1330100760747667459 2020-11-21 18:48:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @mattfrei why is this about Brexit Sir David? It's about alleged bullying isn't it? @lbc

1330098447286996994 2020-11-21 18:39:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @WarriorBrexit @CornockStehen @Keir_Starmer @pritipatel Racism is the lead story that the media only chooses to talk about when it's far right racism.  She apologised for any offence she caused to people. Do you really think she should resign for losing her temper occasionally? You have had a very sheltered life obviously.
1330096841929740292 2020-11-21 18:32:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WarriorBrexit No mention of Bercow or Brown actual bullies...   You either don't understand or choose to ignore the real issue underlying this story.  She got elected to deliver stuff that the civil service don't agree with. They want to demonise her.
1330093458808332288 2020-11-21 18:19:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @Keir_Starmer Not weird Mark. What's weird is how everyone is focussing on alleged bullying rather than ACTUAL racism.
1330092380633096194 2020-11-21 18:15:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @WarriorBrexit @CornockStehen @Keir_Starmer @pritipatel Because he realises she is trying to do her job against a wave of anti govt civil servants.  Nicely dodged the real issue in politics. Actual racism in a party.
1330089356258910216 2020-11-21 18:03:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lbc @mattfrei  Talking about non-bullying in the Tory Party rather than actual racism in the Labour Party.  Hmm ... Interesting...

1329856377292984322 2020-11-21 02:37:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So transgender people are a tiny proportion of the population. And those who have lost their lives from transphobic violence is a small % of a small %.  I need to understand the extent of the issue. With facts.  Because this sound like it must be an extremely big problem.
1329827456933617668 2020-11-21 00:42:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Keir is tough on 'bullying' but lenient on racism. Supporting Corbyn throughout his leadership despite the available evidence.#blatanthypocrisy
1329826179810013187 2020-11-21 00:37:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> The Race Relations Act came into force in the UK in 1965. So that would have been illegal.

1329168895224254464 2020-11-19 05:05:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @stevewil94 Absolutely ridiculous. It doesn't matter whether we think Corbyn is racist he was the leader of a party that has been found to be racist. It was because he opened the door to racists and he didn't do enough to deal with them. He will be permanently blemished by the shame of it.
1329162129883230208 2020-11-19 04:38:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Martles1 @boating_bernard No I don't think so but Starmer will have to address the far left Momentum because they are unelectable no matter how bad the Tories may get.

1329095201982443521 2020-11-19 00:12:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @zarosa @Keir_Starmer Momentum exist because Corbyn grew it. He was the leader &amp; he is accountable for opening the door to racists &amp; not dealing with them. And not looking after Jewish members &amp; MPs. He is the person who is responsible. Him being a poor leader does not excuse him.
1329057148555456513 2020-11-18 21:41:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @zarosa @Keir_Starmer He was the leader of the only party in the UK found guilty of racism by the EHRC. He then suggested that the findings were overstated on the day when it was time for contrition. Apologising for his awful reaction to the report is the very least he could do. Don't you think?
1329031563967934467 2020-11-18 19:59:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @wastingmytime59 @Keir_Starmer It means that he is not a Labour MP. I don't believe Starmer can do anything further as it's down to the NEC to decide whether Corbyn can be a member of the Labour Party. Genuinely, think Starmer will be annoyed at this as it makes him look very weak.
1329025770107375616 2020-11-18 19:36:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Good on @Keir_Starmer for removing the whip from Corbyn. He shouldn't have been reinstated in the Labour Party without giving a proper, genuine apology. That shows how the party and the current leadership are at odds with each other.

1328798979052744707 2020-11-18 04:35:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> It is yet another proud moment in the Labour Party's history. Reinstate membership to a former leader who led a party found guilty of racism. No apology, just let him back in.  It's not like there's any lessons from socialist history to learn here🤨
1328788801716674563 2020-11-18 03:55:12 +0800 <JustineClaire65> And you don't mention the colour of the perpetrators. Just for completeness.

1328013348156420099 2020-11-16 00:33:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> They need to resist the temptation of continually looking for the bad that happened in our history and blaming people in the present. Each time they do this there is another nail in the coffin of tolerance. It divides us and it will end badly.

1327973856573861895 2020-11-15 21:56:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lbc Maajid you are talking emotionally about the Uighar muslims PPE issue. Where's your evidence that it is anything more than a failure of due diligence in an emergency pandemic. You ask everyone to present evidence. Where's yours?

1327666646832607236 2020-11-15 01:36:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @XoCharlotteEmX And that's why Covid is so contagious. The young don't know they have it and spread it without knowing to the old who die from it. Whereas the flu knocks you out, you go to bed and you don't spread it.
1327656495878729728 2020-11-15 00:55:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @mickymoovernon I understand that but I think if he concedes on Brexit his political career is over.

My sister is in her 50s and she's a cleaner in a care home. They have worked throughout. They are white. Do they watch their black coworkers get a vaccination before them? 🤦🏻‍♀️
1327649385807745026 2020-11-15 00:27:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LBC @DavidLammy Vaccination priorities are based on need not race. Never race. Front line workers, old people, people with underlying illnesses. Not colour of skin. That's racist.

I say this as someone from your side who voted Brexit and because of that I became a racist and a fascist. Overnight. And you Maajid blocked me for no good reason. Look at your side.

1327585817246699520 2020-11-14 20:14:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @savingliberals Yup, me neither.
1327585727224360960 2020-11-14 20:14:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @zarosa No. People who don't want Brexit can carry on battling to rejoin. We are leaving good and proper on the 1st January 2021 and that is what the majority of people in this country have wanted and democratically chosen over the last 4.5 years.

1327583943055568896 2020-11-14 20:07:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Nigel100007 @_Geordi_kev_ Thanks. IMO they have taken what they think has happened and speculated exponentially. His partner is entitled to an opinion and Boris is the PM not a child and can therefore decide for himself.
1327583069881184256 2020-11-14 20:04:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Mioewing I don't agree but will agree to disagree. He leads by having the vision and good people around him to deal with the detail.

1327570487078252544 2020-11-14 19:14:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I think he was talking about himself as there is no evidence of Cummings wanting to be in the limelight.

1327562515912527873 2020-11-14 18:42:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @mattfrei @LBC Campbell just called Cummings a narcissist. 😂😂

1327542646840111104 2020-11-14 17:23:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Nigel100007 @_Geordi_kev_ @BorisJohnson This was always a fixed term gig. You misinterpret how these things work. Cummings will be expecting this. If Boris wanted him gone he had the opportunity when he drove to Durham. I'm sure Boris already has him lined up for some other role in the new year.
1327540962978115584 2020-11-14 17:16:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @_Geordi_kev_ @Nigel100007 @BorisJohnson Cummings was an advisor he knew his tenure was limited. He won't lose any sleep over leaving a few weeks early.
1327539878494674945 2020-11-14 17:12:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @bumble200 We'll see. You don't have a crystal ball anymore than the rest of us.
1327539615897686023 2020-11-14 17:11:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Nigel100007 @_Geordi_kev_ @BorisJohnson He became leader because the Tory Party chose him, he won a landslide because of getting Brexit done. He then appointed Cummings. That's the order of events.
1327539154989801474 2020-11-14 17:09:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Nigel100007 @_Geordi_kev_ @BorisJohnson You are just being agitated by the rejoiner MSM who are having a final meltdown. Give him a bit of credit.
1327538743813820416 2020-11-14 17:07:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @bumble200 Hmmm ... 4 years is a long time in politics and that's how long he's got.

1327535755053428738 2020-11-14 16:56:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @_Geordi_kev_ @BorisJohnson I think you underestimate his position on Brexit. He has appeared weak on dealing with woke protestors and illegal immigrants, I agree.
1327534675292803073 2020-11-14 16:51:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I know that people may not like how Boris has handled Covid but why are they questioning his Brexit stance? Who appointed Cummings very controversially in the first place? It will be political suicide to blow Brexit at this point. Why would he want to do that?

1327530818764500995 2020-11-14 16:36:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @anthea_bailey @Effiedeans Pressure from within and outside the Tory party. I agree to disagree.
1327530488819556352 2020-11-14 16:35:07 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jaycee1001 @Norm272 I supported Farage through the Brexit Party because Brexit was top of my agenda. When we get Brexit, ie we are out of the transition period, I will be politically homeless.
1327527196286717952 2020-11-14 16:22:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @anthea_bailey @Effiedeans No, whether you agree with a single other thing that Farage says the referendum was on him. The pressure on May's Tory sell out was on him. Via UKIP and the Brexit Party respectively.
1327525684625936384 2020-11-14 16:16:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Effiedeans Agree. And it wouldn't have happened without Farage.
1327524661652021249 2020-11-14 16:11:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc This is what you remainers don't get Mark. Leavers don't think they made a mistake because whatever happens we will be a free independent country who makes its own decisions. If our govt lets us down we vote them out. Can't vote the EU hierarchy out Mark.
1327370946563411968 2020-11-14 06:01:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc Well why would you think that someone who has dedicated years of his life to a goal would 6 weeks before it is due to happen back off with the sudden realisation that he'd made a terrible mistake. Get real🙄Boris needs to do the rest. Simple as that.
1327362670023020546 2020-11-14 05:28:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc Absolutely not, just wishful thinking on your part.

1326533731423678468 2020-11-11 22:34:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I would imagine that they can't discriminate by race as this would be illegal. So I suspect the prioritisation would be on need. A rare concept these days.
1326532068059320320 2020-11-11 22:27:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ukreloaded However, if I was in a vulnerable category I would definitely have it because it would be preferable to isolation for me. I'm not anti vaccination. I just don't see that I need to.
1326508395386560512 2020-11-11 20:53:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ZeroCarbSarah @LaffsFor @london_rider @allisonpearson Dr Sparkles is it?🙄
1326507128975134721 2020-11-11 20:48:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnLibNat @moanahleeza @allisonpearson It hasn't changed you. I do have a support network but that wasn't given me on a plate. This is where you need friends, neighbours, family, colleagues. Hope it works out and your voluntary work gives you something meaningful &amp; rewarding to do. Things will get better.
1326504432146796545 2020-11-11 20:37:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnLibNat @moanahleeza @allisonpearson I don't like it. My partner's business has dried up. My son finished his degree at home, then had to battle for a job in this economic climate. I'm going to work longer than I'd planned but I'm not railing against it because it just makes you miserable. I'm an optimist. Always.
1326502872712957952 2020-11-11 20:31:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @BOBERTCOL @0_politics2 It's very divisive putting people into boxes. If we think we are all in this together we would flush out and deal with any systemic unfairness. We are on the wrong track with this. You end up with hypocrisy and distrust. It's stressful.
1326501490895319040 2020-11-11 20:26:15 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnLibNat @moanahleeza @allisonpearson I have no idea who is asking you to be grateful but with that negative attitude to life you will not be pulling yourself out of this spiral. You need to speak to someone professional because you are likely suffering from depression. Which is treatable. Take care of yourself.
1326500153738612736 2020-11-11 20:20:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ZeroCarbSarah @LaffsFor @london_rider @allisonpearson These are different tests and the false positives are reduced.
1326499902764036096 2020-11-11 20:19:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DelythHughes62 @allisonpearson No I don't. It is to test and pick out those who have the virus.
1326499570939990016 2020-11-11 20:18:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnLibNat @moanahleeza @allisonpearson I don't recognise the harshness that you describe except where people seem happy for millions of vulnerable people to self isolate while the rest of us 'get on with it'. It is the Communist Party of China with the bad values you refer to. The regime, not the Chinese people.
1326498160831844352 2020-11-11 20:13:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AmaryllisFfolk1 @allisonpearson Hmmm ... no it's not easy but it's either that or allow the virus to spread and end up with our hospitals only catering for Covid. The Universities need to help students who are self isolating with practical support. We are all making sacrifices, not just students.
1326275912258686981 2020-11-11 05:29:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @totallyunrelat1 @LozzaFox He didn't though. If you listen to the whole thing he said it as he was criticising racists who troll footballers. He made a mistake. How did we arrive at a point where someone is labelled a racist for using a word incorrectly and has to resign from their job. That's intolerance.
1326273229103751173 2020-11-11 05:19:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnLibNat @LaffsFor @allisonpearson My son's not at Uni now but if he was he would want the test so that he didn't pass this horrible virus onto his grandad at Christmas. I don't understand why you are locked up.
1326268449262333953 2020-11-11 05:00:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnLibNat @LaffsFor @allisonpearson To me it's like saying don't bother having a flu jab if you are old because you could die of a heart attack. Nothing is guaranteed.
1326265908034228227 2020-11-11 04:50:07 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ianmac67_SE Hey, we have something in common then Ian. I love a happy ending😉
1326265246663782401 2020-11-11 04:47:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ianmac67_SE Oh I see. So you are a closet #FBPE then Ian?
1326263863113814019 2020-11-11 04:42:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @k_t_12345_67890 @JohnLibNat @allisonpearson Probably just coincidence that the second wave happened a few weeks after the students went back.
1326263373835739138 2020-11-11 04:40:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ianmac67_SE Me? 🤣🤣 Was it the picture of Tony Benn that made you draw that conclusion.
1326259445110890497 2020-11-11 04:24:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @poshfruit Keep Britain Free. Usually people who don't want any restrictions because of covid.
1326258457259945985 2020-11-11 04:20:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> No offence but I can't always keep up. Is #KBF the new #FBPE? Just the insults and intolerance of many have been stirring memories.  I know it's a shocker but people can see the world differently and not be a brainwashed, sheep😁

1326252358725226496 2020-11-11 03:56:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @sarahbbsunny @allisonpearson Yes, but highly unlikely and it is more about picking out the positives and getting them to isolate. Sadly this is what getting on with it looks like. Unless you want to fill all the hospitals up and lock up the elderly.
1326251322438520836 2020-11-11 03:52:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @EverywhereInOne @EmmP04264348 @NikkiStix55 @kickitout The words you use are more important than the point you are making or the side you are taking in the progressive year of 2020.
1326249555508256770 2020-11-11 03:45:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GreenH11 @allisonpearson It is highly unlikely. And no testing is perfect but it will reduce the spread. I don't really understand why anyone has a problem with this tbh.
1326247420548820993 2020-11-11 03:36:40 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @sarahbbsunny @allisonpearson I'm not miserable, just sensible and want to be able to mix with people safely, rather than make people poorly.   You are free to do what the hell you like.
1326246396404568070 2020-11-11 03:32:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnLibNat @allisonpearson I have no idea why mass testing students can impact on you. I'm sorry if you are having a bad time though and do not want to add to anything going on in your life.
1326245088826175488 2020-11-11 03:27:24 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GreenH11 @Mioewing @allisonpearson Because they became poorly first and took the test. They were all poorly in the end.
1326244613338902532 2020-11-11 03:25:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @CoddGrahame @allisonpearson Read the stuff around these particular tests.
1326244350259572736 2020-11-11 03:24:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnLibNat @allisonpearson No when there's a pandemic you do put safety first. My son has just finished his degree but if he was away  now I would be grateful for him having a test so that we can have his 91 year old granddad around for Christmas as normal.
1326235186024099843 2020-11-11 02:48:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnLibNat @allisonpearson A big difference with flu is that you are really poorly with flu and you would not want to infect elderly relatives. You would take yourself to bed. If they have Covid they may not have symptoms. It's not flu.
1326234112609366018 2020-11-11 02:43:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnLibNat @allisonpearson No I'm not, they are testing so that they can come home safely.
1326233831922405385 2020-11-11 02:42:40 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Mioewing @allisonpearson A friend of a friend had a Uni student come home for a break and she passed it to her two siblings and mum and dad. They were all poorly but not hospitalised. At Christmas they do mix with elderly relatives more and that is the real worry.
1326232653461397510 2020-11-11 02:37:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @allisonpearson Because over a million students will be going home to spread Covid amongst their families, their elderly grandparents and aunties and uncles. Those who test positive will self isolate and still have the opportunity to travel home in time for Christmas.

And when he decides to peacefully bomb another country in the middle east I guess he'll be looking for Irish support there which should work out for the best.

But we are not those countries, in those situations. Working people no longer have any party looking out for them. That vacuum will be filled. It should be the birth of something good.

1325507002513166350 2020-11-09 02:34:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @CiskaPrins @Nigel_Farage The equivalent would be for him to say his ancestry is European. Not Irish.
1325506583359606785 2020-11-09 02:32:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @CiskaPrins @Nigel_Farage Because he shouldn't let his Irish ancestry affect his American policy. How hard is that to understand?

1325503516731961344 2020-11-09 02:20:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @CiskaPrins @Nigel_Farage Good for them, maybe some of them should move back home, there seems to be room.   So long as Biden remembers that he is the POTUS and promised to bring people together rather than increase division.   So long as he sticks to that promise then everything will be fine.
1325501887727235072 2020-11-09 02:14:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @catgovey65 Haha ... we would have had one, with Trump. You know this. But you're an anti democrat aren't you.
1325501573892595717 2020-11-09 02:12:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I'm never sure why 'populist' is a bad word. Is it because the privileged elite don't like the oiks expressing an opinion?  I love one person one vote it's such a leveller.   Oh and there are a lot more of us oiks.

Just I seem to treat them as I would anyone else because I don't hold them responsible for what their country did not so long ago.
1325430059772030978 2020-11-08 21:28:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @19164th @LGouldy22 @pauldoc64 @Nigel_Farage Uneducated because I find it funny that you think Dublin has more influence in the world than England. Are you a parody account btw?

1325421719008501761 2020-11-08 20:55:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @mariamccluskeys @Nigel_Farage I'm over it Maria. Just so long as Biden remembers he's American, representing America. Not Irish, representing Ireland. Else you agree that it's good for him to mainly represent white, elderly, heterosexual men? Because that's who he is too.
1325420373828136965 2020-11-08 20:50:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @haggo28 @DoYouReallyBel1 @Nigel_Farage No, I agree that Joe Biden thinks we have damaged the peace agreement.

1325398092624130049 2020-11-08 19:21:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Salywebster That was absolutely my reaction.
1325397785592651783 2020-11-08 19:20:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DoYouReallyBel1 @Nigel_Farage He was elected on the basis of representing Americans not just Irish Americans. He has already suggested he is not supportive of Brexit because it may affect the peace agreement. Whatever I thought of Trump he was supportive of the UK's democratic decision to leave the EU.
1325389363279257600 2020-11-08 18:47:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DoYouReallyBel1 @Nigel_Farage Did you watch the clip? I'm commenting on that.

1325382206081130497 2020-11-08 18:18:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Fur farming was banned in the UK in 2000. 🇬🇧

1325378474857684992 2020-11-08 18:03:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Looks like #marr is trying to get Raab to criticise the American election process. Clearly Raab does not believe there is a problem but still #marr tries ...🤨
1325365793689903104 2020-11-08 17:13:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @andy67_mac @Nigel_Farage Brexit has happened already. Keep up.  My ancestors are pretty much all Irish but I am British &amp; English and proud of both.  I take responsibility for my own actions but not the actions of dead people who I never knew.
1325365052946460672 2020-11-08 17:10:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @voetball13396 @Nigel_Farage My ancestors left because of the famine, so not my bad love.  This trying to make people take responsibility for what people did hundreds of years ago is pathetic &amp; funny when it backfires.
1325363828239065088 2020-11-08 17:05:35 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @nutts_mutts @Nigel_Farage I love sore losers. It's like watching toddlers 'share'.😂
1325362503535169536 2020-11-08 17:00:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @HealySbridge @Nigel_Farage But does she think of herself as German and would she treat Germany differently from other countries.
1325361216412393472 2020-11-08 16:55:12 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Patrick62404445 @Nigel_Farage True. I had a lovely holiday in Cuba once.
1325182586067554304 2020-11-08 05:05:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @sandieshoes And it's rather shameful in the biggest liberal democracy that there has never been a woman of any colour as the POTUS.
1325181373427056643 2020-11-08 05:00:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ArchRose90 But it was in a wind tunnel.
1325177613187346432 2020-11-08 04:45:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Really strange to see Twitter caveat the POTUS's tweets. Free speech feels a bit less free now.
1325175197087924224 2020-11-08 04:36:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Nigel_Farage Irish descent fgs. Not even his parents were born in Ireland.
1325162601932730368 2020-11-08 03:45:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Femi_Sorry @realDonaldTrump Nice swinging brick for a heart you have there Femi.  Better out than in though, as us leavers like to say 😉
1325122174533951488 2020-11-08 01:05:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Just after it was announced that Trump's lawyers were doing a press conference then Biden wins🤨  The BBC clearly have cameras on the Trump lawyers because we skipped there briefly but looks like they are going to just talk amongst themselves rather than watch real news.😡
1325116721045364737 2020-11-08 00:43:40 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @tractorboynz @LBC Matt Frei was it😁
1325113826874945539 2020-11-08 00:32:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So Biden 'won'.
1325082764278984706 2020-11-07 22:28:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc Listen to @LBC Maajid Nawaz on catch up, today at 1pm. There are some questions that need to be answered. Don't let your dislike of Trump interfere with wanting to know the truth. Nawaz is a liberal commentator.
1325036097240444929 2020-11-07 19:23:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc What is the point of the MSM if not to investigate things like this. Is it just to titillate and humiliate? To be on the side of one group in society?  It may be BS but they should still be checking it out if only to disprove it.
1325021875588788225 2020-11-07 18:26:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Liseylox Probably just opened is second bottle of red.
1325019452057022464 2020-11-07 18:17:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lbc @mattfrei You have to be having a laugh with your faux anger at Trump!  You &amp; @Channel4News absolutely went out of your way to try to prove that Vote Leave, the Brexit Party, Banks &amp; Farage were corrupt &amp; you didn't manage to prove a thing did you.  #Hypocrite
1325018266402775040 2020-11-07 18:12:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Hmmm ...  When you don't like the outcome of a vote you just try to make them vote again don't you? #TheHypocriteGuy
1325015996021747714 2020-11-07 18:03:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @miketal13 Totally agree.
1324997951786250240 2020-11-07 16:51:43 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @FredBasset9 @futureking57 I expect them to seek the truth, or at least I expect some of them to. If not then our idea of liberal democracy is already very broken.
1324997103547002880 2020-11-07 16:48:21 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Rickwoohan2 This is what the MSM should be about, this is why western democracies have free media rather than state controlled media. We should care that they don’t seem interested in investigating something the elected POUS is alleging. Because you and I can’t find the truth can we?
1324993369236508672 2020-11-07 16:33:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Is it a competition?  How about the image of a genuinely starving child in Africa?
1324988996603310081 2020-11-07 16:16:08 +0800 <JustineClaire65> The POTUS is making allegations of electoral fraud, is the MSM looking into that at all? Or can you not be bothered?  I don’t know what the truth is here but I expect the MSM to be looking for it rather than just taking sides.
1324808490137849856 2020-11-07 04:18:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @davidofhook He self identifies an an elf.

1324803144510046213 2020-11-07 03:57:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> You are so funny Layla. Have you forgotten what you and your party tried to do to our democratic process.🤣

1324794517829070848 2020-11-07 03:23:21 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @AdamCaplin So he'll look a fool when he presents no evidence to court. Let the process be over &amp; the courts deal with his claims. Then we can safely say there was nothing fraudulent going on, or there was. That's how it works in the states, there's always litigation.
1324791824091877378 2020-11-07 03:12:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Lesqueenb I think it's more likely that he'll be alive but with increasingly obvious memory issues.

1324783735200468992 2020-11-07 02:40:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DIGADA1 😂
1324768287616630785 2020-11-07 01:39:07 +0800 <JustineClaire65> But were you forced to apologise Carole? Or are you genuinely remorseful?
1324766487400337411 2020-11-07 01:31:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @AdamCaplin Most states in the US counted them quickly. Guess they just needed more counters in some states. Time will tell as to whether any significant fraud was committed. I think people have suddenly turned very naive if they think there will be no fraud, don't you think😁
1324764479255699465 2020-11-07 01:23:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @fox_lozza Not me Lozza. I'm an observer, not supporting any of it, or that.
1324706496081502210 2020-11-06 21:33:35 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @kensdavies Thanks.
1324706326694535172 2020-11-06 21:32:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AdamCaplin Yeah, as you said.
1324690330298572800 2020-11-06 20:29:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AdamCaplin No way should a count take this long and I believe it is unusual.  I don't care whether he's won or lost tbh but I do care that a proper democratic process has been followed.  Mathematically he has not lost because some states can't count quickly.
1324689549696602113 2020-11-06 20:26:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @kensdavies Oh ok, so they are keeping a cumulative total as each county declares? So is the state result based on voter percentage across all counties or by the sum of how each county went? ie if 9 counties are blue and 10 are red does red get the state?
1324687305219674113 2020-11-06 20:17:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Why do we even know that Biden is gaining momentum in Georgia? Isn't it all supposed to be secret until it's officially announced?
1324683978738147328 2020-11-06 20:04:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AdamCaplin I'm not being silly. I'm saying that the counting should be done quickly because it opens it up for allegations of fraud. I said it LOOKS dodgy, not that it IS dodgy.  He hasn't lost yet so why should he say he has?
1324613985275121665 2020-11-06 15:25:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @iMultitudes Same thing really but different angle. Allege the process is fraudulent and try to prove in court.
1324609703326998528 2020-11-06 15:08:57 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Given that everyone knew Trump was suspicious of fraud why is it taking so long to count the votes in these last states?   It looks dodgy.
1324607273008656384 2020-11-06 14:59:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> It's not the same people who shouted fraud over the leave vote criticising Trump for alleging fraud is it? 🙄

1323996402960289792 2020-11-04 22:31:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So funny hearing these commentators having a go at Trump for sowing discord about the electoral process in the states😂😂  Ahemm ... {clears throat}   Nobody has ever been that divisive, ever about the results of an election. Ever.  Love a bit of irony me😉

1323967785811222528 2020-11-04 20:38:12 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Why does it take so long to count the votes in some states?
1323960939440492544 2020-11-04 20:11:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @robertwlk If you were assessing which method of voting is more prone to fraud then in any rational person's mind it would be with postal voting and not with 'the turning up in person' approach. But let's all pretend that Trump is being irrational.😡

1323947329754406913 2020-11-04 19:16:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @RolandFSmith I was serious. Literally had one tweet available in my all notifications. My account looks fine otherwise.

1323179921322237952 2020-11-02 16:27:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @EmmaMitchel3 I'm not sure the stats showed that the measures currently in place for tier 3 don't work. You could see the R reducing in the NW &amp; the kids have been at school. We cannot disrupt their education any further imo. I live in a rural area in T1 &amp; full lockdown is inappropriate here.
1323177782554275840 2020-11-02 16:19:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Jon_statistics @sandieshoes Nobody should blindly follow anyone. Constant criticism doesn't take us forward either. We all have a part to play you are right. I see mine as trying to reduce the transmission of the virus amongst my family, friends and community.

1322989146714050560 2020-11-02 03:49:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @gnrsmiffies I love kids (of all ages!) but they do seem to be the natural spreaders of Covid often without knowing. And Christmas may be an accident waiting to happen.
1322986130451681281 2020-11-02 03:37:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Fionalo53519376 Yes, none were hospitalised but it's just at Christmas we mix with the older generation more too which was my concern.
1322985744772796416 2020-11-02 03:35:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ukreloaded Because the secondary schools, colleges and universities went back.
1322985103665074176 2020-11-02 03:33:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @alotment_man I think they need to test before they come home as they may be mixing with the vulnerable, assuming that's allowed😢
1322983593912750080 2020-11-02 03:27:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I do agree with keeping schools &amp; universities open but a friend of a friend has just been diagnosed with Covid. His daughter came home from uni &amp; infected her 2 brothers, mum &amp; dad. All had symptoms &amp; were poorly. Imagine what Christmas will be like when the students come home.

1322950241096736780 2020-11-02 01:14:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Luckyxmanda Did I say lockdown was right?   And I don't agree that illegal immigrants are let in, or that people demonstrate in the middle of a pandemic.

1322835114754232320 2020-11-01 17:37:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Did I dream about the Labour Party being defined as racist by the EHRC this week #marr? Just you have the leader of the Labour Party on and you haven't asked a single question about it yet.

1322821256736026625 2020-11-01 16:42:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> There’s a whole bunch of people who want to see Boris gone because of Brexit.   The same people are using Covid19 as a means to that end.  A lot of people are saying, ‘don’t be fooled’ by the govt stats on Covid19.  I’m saying, ‘don’t be fooled’ by some peoples’ motivations.

The medical experts are saying that the hospital admissions are rising too quickly. I suppose they are best placed to know what they can cope with. Better than you or I.
1322468261204758528 2020-10-31 17:19:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @cash4questions2 It's never too late because 'doing the right thing' will be needed for the foreseeable future. But it may be too late to prevent a second lockdown sadly.

1322465741384392705 2020-10-31 17:09:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @hughbie No they are not, lockdowns are for everyone. And everyone is responsible for not spreading the virus. Doctors are not working class are they.

1322463517069496320 2020-10-31 17:00:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @sw18780774 @BorisJohnson They weren't needed because the first lockdown was effective. They were moth-balled I believe, so that they could be reinstated with a second wave.  The second wave was always anticipated and over winter this is a worry because of flu.
1322462460658503680 2020-10-31 16:56:35 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ZokaShaun Well it depends what you mean by lockdowns working.  They slow the spread but they have side effects as you point out.  If we all do what we can to stop the spread, without a lockdown, that would work better.
1322460374151647232 2020-10-31 16:48:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I absolutely think another lockdown will be a disaster for our economy.  But the government cannot watch the number of hospital admissions rise and do nothing.  So the hard truth is that unless each of us 'does the right thing' then we are headed for a second lockdown.
1322458316287692801 2020-10-31 16:40:07 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @OirishPatrick Absolutely. We live in a country where a lot of people prefer to blame someone else for everything. Usually the government. The same people who want to be treated as adults.🤨

Whether Mohammed said good things is an irrelevance if his word is used by many to terrorise people who have different views.  Decapitating innocent, peaceful people in the name of any God tells me that religion has gone bad.

1322181217400270854 2020-10-30 22:19:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @qikipedia My son 22, DM'd me this as he was Joseph at 5yrs &amp; a little girl I looked after (I was a childminder then) played Mary. Not sure how she's doing but my son has just graduated from Warwick with a maths degree &amp; is in week 1 of his first 'proper' job. Could be true🤞

1321844804364439553 2020-10-30 00:02:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Lots of Labour luvvies have gone into meltdown today.  Lots of deflecting from the truth.  Very little 'owning' of their absolute disgrace.
1321841275767869441 2020-10-29 23:48:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Keir_Starmer sat quite happily with Corbyn as I recall whilst in his cabinet. Supported him throughout.  Is this a U turn Mr Starmer?
1321834752689770497 2020-10-29 23:22:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I'm absolutely not with Macron over Brexit but I am 100% in support of his condemnation of Islamic terrorism which threatens our deeply held Western values of free speech and freedom of expression.  https://t.co/GupJgJWEB0

1321828182820069376 2020-10-29 22:56:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> This is Ash deflecting.  The issue is that your party, the Labour Party, is the only officially racist party in the UK.   Not a proud moment really is it.

1321796652060053506 2020-10-29 20:50:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lbc James O'Brien what does it feel like to have voted for a racist party?   How could you have got that so very wrong?  Would tweet you but you have blocked me. So you only have your echo chamber. May be part of the reason that you got this so wrong.
1321794901382696960 2020-10-29 20:43:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> What does it feel like to belong to a racist political party @DavidLammy. You don't appear to have offered your comments on this very important issue.  An issue that dominates your life ordinarily.
1321725088958423040 2020-10-29 16:06:32 +0800 <JustineClaire65> This creates racial division. I saw Stacey as a documentary maker drawing our attention to the issue for children in Africa. Lammy and Henry just saw her as a 'white' celebrity. I won't be giving as my money obviously offends them.   https://t.co/hrtaeLfXud via @MetroUK

1321089179556712450 2020-10-27 21:59:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Crosscolin88 It's an attempt to close down any challenge to this waste of money exercise. If you like to see hungry children starve then you are a terrible person &amp; I don't have to listen to terrible people because I'm the good guy. 🙄 Like when they call people racists, fascists or far right
1321086772282052629 2020-10-27 21:50:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I was a working class kid and my mother fed me as do the vast majority of working class parents now.  Don't pretend this has anything to do with 'hungry' kids.

That may not have happened if there had been a viable alternative. The LP is abysmal.

I think TBP are trying to side with their working class supporters whilst not understanding that their supporters prioritise feeding their kids.

The difference is that you don't expect that an extreme element of that religion will decapitate people. Or countries issue fatwas, to kill people. That is terrorism. We should stand strong against that.

'The social pay it'. It was to try to treat the claimant as an adult with responsibilities so they could budget.
1320343398872731648 2020-10-25 20:36:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Lots of people still crying over Brexit on this thread🙄
1320340378399199233 2020-10-25 20:24:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jenhallam @LindaLetitbe If they are genuinely hungry then they cannot get obese by eating chips and nuggets. Of course you know that. People only become obese by consuming too many calories ie they are not hungry.
1320333556284067843 2020-10-25 19:57:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LauraBridger 😂😂 Reacting to everything emotionally rather than using evidence never works.   As a vegan I'll have to take your word that I'm a gammon. But if that means I am someone unafraid to speak about issues that leave wet lettuces with hurty feelings then I expect I must be 😉
1320303323581480960 2020-10-25 17:56:57 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @matsteiner @OneTrueSpartan I did, its blurry and I can't read it. Genuinely.Does it say what our unemployment % is compared with other countries?
1320303134338478082 2020-10-25 17:56:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @matsteiner @OneTrueSpartan I did, its blurry and I can't read it. Genuinely.

1320302466337067008 2020-10-25 17:53:32 +0800 <JustineClaire65> #marr you are continuing this 'starving' children bandwagon. They are back at school having fs meals. Local authorities have been given additional support. We have a child obesity problem in this country amongst the poor! Why do you not look at the reality.
1320297298941837312 2020-10-25 17:33:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @matsteiner Well he's getting a good opportunity to defend his position which is what I want. Even though I personally disagree with the Welsh national lockdown.
1320296236935712769 2020-10-25 17:28:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @matsteiner Yes, I'm not a Tory btw, I understand that the govt needs to be held to account and that they have done things wrong but we all need the govt to succeed. Continual bashing will not lead to a good outcome.
1320294185833029632 2020-10-25 17:20:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @matsteiner Is it this govt that is wrong on its Covid strategy, how about an international comparison with similar countries? Speak to poor rather than wealthy people about 'starving' children and examine why we have a child obesity problem and 'starving' children at the same time?
1320292773929639937 2020-10-25 17:15:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @SmIain Because I want to understand what the state broadcaster has to say. #marr has been better this season doing interviews with different scientists but feels like it's back to pure Tory bashing.
1320292113859383296 2020-10-25 17:12:24 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @matsteiner But we could look at the issues from many perspectives. Or we can just continue to throw rotten vegetables at the Tories.
1320291392439070720 2020-10-25 17:09:32 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Tory bashing all the way through today on  #marr?
1320280633931857920 2020-10-25 16:26:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @adwallt @DCBMEP I understand that but we the customer should not be prevented from buying things that are on the shelves in front of us. Seems very controlling. Supermarkets are convenient and the small stores have been struggling for years. I feel sorry for them, but don't think this helps.
1320279117196132352 2020-10-25 16:20:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Lizbrodrick1 @glennmid10001 @dan63uk @LSadler16861851 @FeedingBristol It covers rent, council tax, food and utility bills. It's tight because it's a safety net. You are claiming it until you get work. If you or anyone is disabled then you get more. However much money there is the priorities are feeding your kids and paying your rent.
1320275826856939520 2020-10-25 16:07:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @adwallt @DCBMEP None of this is fair. Many people will have bought their kettles, pans etc from supermarkets for years. It just makes the whole lockdown experience even more annoying. You can see the kettle you want but you have to go home, order online, pay for delivery and wait.

1319910677440548864 2020-10-24 15:56:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TVNaga01 @BBCNews  You rarely interview parents who can't feed their children and I think this is because they don't look malnourished do they, nor do the children. Instead you interview middle class people who have a political agenda hiding behind a story that isn't true.
1319906933793579009 2020-10-24 15:41:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Feeding children is the responsibility of parents not the govt. That money should be spent on education. I'm happy to have a go at all governments for not funding education for the poor. But I don't like this dependency culture where everything bad is always someone else's fault.

1319681211095187460 2020-10-24 00:44:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Yeah we remember how the legal system works for the rich during Brexit. But we were told well that's the law, none of us are above it.   So Carole, that's the law🤷🏻‍♀️

We do not live in Victorian England.  We, the tax payer, fund the state. We have a right to a view on how our money is spent.

It is there for the vulnerable, and all of us should we fall on hard times. I never mentioned deserving. I'd prefer to use the word needing.  Enough to be able to feed your children outside of school.

But they weren't hungry. Hand me down clothes &amp; little furniture, no carpets maybe. My son (22) said he had lots of mates on free school meals &amp; he didn't understand why. Doesn't add up.

But many have not got their priorities right. And we shouldn't be blaming the govt, any govt, for personal failure.  Feeding children is a parental responsibility and it has become too easy to blame the govt, as I say, any govt.

The state should protect the child &amp; not just look the other way in relation to the cause. There may be much more going on there. Instead you would just feed the child and ignore the problem.

1319276561128849409 2020-10-22 21:56:57 +0800 <JustineClaire65> It is generous, it gives sufficient for people to survive. It does not cover luxuries.  A benefits system is there as a safety net not a life choice. Society is based around people going out to work and paying taxes. Without that you have no benefits system.
1319274278072717315 2020-10-22 21:47:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon It is compared to most countries actually. In fact most countries don't really have a benefits system do they.  Most people can afford to feed their kids on benefits and we need to target help for those who can't not just throw money at it.

1319237558535131137 2020-10-22 19:21:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I think we are all agreed that no one wants any child to go hungry.

It is not the fault of children which school they go to but it is down to the state to make sure every child has equal access to a good education.

1318951448135303170 2020-10-22 00:25:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Poor white boys are the most disadvantaged ethnic group in our education system.  Who is fighting for their rights? 😡@TheLabourParty_     https://t.co/t5O7zslnbv
1318947691800526848 2020-10-22 00:10:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ARookwood She chooses this one to appear neutral about🤦🏻‍♀️
1318947381686247425 2020-10-22 00:08:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @RhystheSosijdog @ChrisClarksonMP She said it or why did she get told off.
1318947161858592768 2020-10-22 00:08:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jeremy_hume @JakeWri38029870 @titch_26 You really think that citizens are "far freer" in China than the UK?
1318946220790980609 2020-10-22 00:04:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> That make it ok Beth?
1318945660469678081 2020-10-22 00:02:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @FJEB88 My problem is that I've never known my place😂 Probably wouldn't like it if I did.
1318945018732752896 2020-10-21 23:59:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @FJEB88 😂 They really don't get any of it do they😉
1318944474450591744 2020-10-21 23:57:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WhatNowDoc 😂
1318944298361098241 2020-10-21 23:56:40 +0800 <JustineClaire65> The condescending, superiority complex ridden, state of this thread🤦🏻‍♀️
1318841738212106242 2020-10-21 17:09:07 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon No, we lived in caves without a concept of 'state'. We would have protected our caves from intruders. Ownership would not have had a monetary value but I bet there was violence in protecting the cave from intruders 😉
1318664087736340481 2020-10-21 05:23:12 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon @salaxxxxxxxx Too easy. Sometimes its your responsibility and not the state's. I believe in equal opportunity. Access to free health &amp; education. A safety net for when you are vulnerable or down on your luck.  The rest of life is what you make it.
1318648913382068226 2020-10-21 04:22:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon @salaxxxxxxxx Ok. Would you share your wealth if you don't want to spend it on a house? After all you didn't earn that money and there are people who need it more than you?  Because this is exactly how inequality starts.
1318643827067019264 2020-10-21 04:02:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon @salaxxxxxxxx It's not really a personal detail is it. Not asking where you live. If a relative left you enough money to buy a small flat/house what would you do?
1318640904354365440 2020-10-21 03:51:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon @salaxxxxxxxx Now you are avoiding my direct question Jack.
1318639547673182215 2020-10-21 03:45:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon @salaxxxxxxxx So do you rent your home?
1318636134499520512 2020-10-21 03:32:08 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon @salaxxxxxxxx Getting a bit hysterical now Jack😂
1318635888717475842 2020-10-21 03:31:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon @salaxxxxxxxx No it means that I have a point. You don't like that so you prefer the comfort of your leave voter trope. Disappointing Jack.
1318635452933509121 2020-10-21 03:29:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon @salaxxxxxxxx In social housing we provide shelter for the street homeless, abused women, people with disabilities etc  Are you saying that a private landlord has no right to income from renting their property? That might be someone's main income. Not all landlords are rich.
1318633135752552449 2020-10-21 03:20:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @faslaneflyer Could have used some commas maybe but I liked the relentlessness of the sentence in the end😉
1318632809582518272 2020-10-21 03:18:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon @salaxxxxxxxx Yes it is ok. They sign a contract and in this country there is very little reason why they can't pay their rent. They have access to benefits. That's life Jack you have to look after yourself. Other people are not responsible for providing you with a home.
1318632010894725129 2020-10-21 03:15:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon @salaxxxxxxxx Generally in our country it is absolute.
1318631352024092673 2020-10-21 03:13:07 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon Or because most unaccompanied children and illegal immigrants are BAME Jack. And Dawn is only interested in BAME issues as you know. Not a hard or unusual leap really.
1318630592750211072 2020-10-21 03:10:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon @salaxxxxxxxx Oh get real. Bailiffs chuck people out not the police. And they do that because a court of law has instructed  that it is lawful. If they are vulnerable then the local authority has a responsibility for temporary housing. So it depends on the circumstances.
1318629489547554817 2020-10-21 03:05:43 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon She is always on about BAME people, you know that's what she means. If they were white unaccompanied children she wouldn't be interested.
1318628314223955977 2020-10-21 03:01:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon Immigration changes.
1318628178345271298 2020-10-21 03:00:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon Who are the unaccompanied children?
1318627957565423616 2020-10-21 02:59:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon @salaxxxxxxxx Jack I've worked in social housing my 30+year career and I believe in providing low cost homes for people in need. I was brought up in a council house. I don't believe in evicting people, I understand that housing is a basic human need.
1318624920155361280 2020-10-21 02:47:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon @salaxxxxxxxx Literally no idea what you are talking about. Your examples are so abstract I don't know what to say 😁
1318622472917352450 2020-10-21 02:37:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> According to you most BAME people don't like it here and we don't treat BAME people well so why do you want to cause more BAME people more misery?
1318621325917900800 2020-10-21 02:33:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon @salaxxxxxxxx Oh so you think I am a fascist. Well I did vote leave and people like you don't like that so by my own definition you may be right.   I don't understand what you mean by the state taking people's lives in the name of private property. Are you talking of some other country?
1318620442068979716 2020-10-21 02:29:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @PaulGreenTPB @Crosscolin88 Exactly.
1318620207997440008 2020-10-21 02:28:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GemChaser @jaipo Or maybe severe covid just caused his heart to fail. Whereas if he hadn't had Covid he would have survived. Not from fear or stress but from a lack of oxygen in his blood or blood clots. Known symptoms of severe Covid illness. Just a thought.
1318618352584187906 2020-10-21 02:21:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @NadineDorries Plus the under 60s with underlying conditions.  And most people in their 60s still need to work. No pensions until you are 66 or 67.
1318617096419479552 2020-10-21 02:16:29 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Crosscolin88 Methinks Jeremy doth protest too much😉
1318616022925049857 2020-10-21 02:12:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon @salaxxxxxxxx As usual you haven't answered the question and you're rambling.
1318612906385330177 2020-10-21 01:59:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @FXdestination @jenninemorgan @Francis_Hoar @JamieBrysonCPNI So what's the story then, I'm intrigued.
1318612381719810049 2020-10-21 01:57:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon @salaxxxxxxxx Racism is nothing to do with skin colour anymore. That's so last season.  'Violently imposed'? So name me a fascist then?
1318610225604317184 2020-10-21 01:49:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Yes, let's talk about racial disadvantage, all of it. So why aren't you calling for the racial disparity that there is in this country for poor WHITE boys in education to be addressed. Doesn't fit your ugly narrative that fact does it?
1318596583081103362 2020-10-21 00:54:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> You need to mix in better circles.
1318596118096318465 2020-10-21 00:53:07 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jaipo But he had survived that all his life until Covid. Just a coincidence I suppose. Or are you saying that many people are walking about with underlying conditions that they don't know about until they get Covid so we should all perhaps take care?
1318595242027876352 2020-10-21 00:49:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Yes, that'd cheer everyone up wouldn't it.
1318593837724553223 2020-10-21 00:44:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @bbclaurak I thought he said the door was open for discussion.
1318590909135654912 2020-10-21 00:32:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @HHepplewhite He's just tweeted a link to his speech.
1318589741873483777 2020-10-21 00:27:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @HHepplewhite Thanks I'll have a look.
1318589042024472577 2020-10-21 00:25:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @HHepplewhite Where was that? Have you got a link?
1318588572283359236 2020-10-21 00:23:08 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Oh please be consistent @theJeremyVine🙄  Patronising, wokey people telling us to do what they say but not what they do. #hypocrisy
1318587214599720968 2020-10-21 00:17:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Why are their families in this country without them? Do you mean extended families? Why would you leave your child to travel unaccompanied? Or are they orphans?
1318579013187751939 2020-10-20 23:45:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @stevesnell59uk He's using his position and his influence to interfere in politics. I'm sure the Queen has an opinion, she keeps out.
1318578636702781440 2020-10-20 23:43:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @rjheathfield On that we are agreed then😁
1318570344584744966 2020-10-20 23:10:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @juliesmith472 Lost touch just like the rest of the establishment.
1318570103097741314 2020-10-20 23:09:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Deiniolman But luckily we made a sensible decision😁
1318552726939308034 2020-10-20 22:00:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @andy_hayter 👍
1318269144517795841 2020-10-20 03:13:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Bio: "Enjoying watching Britain fall apart".   Stay and watch then, or do you realise you are going to be very disappointed?
1318266428022194185 2020-10-20 03:03:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> 👏🏻👏🏻 Great last comment by Gove.
1318250646123008004 2020-10-20 02:00:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @rjheathfield Fair enough. I don't, but would be happy for them to contribute and use their influence in pursuit of policies which help the poor and vulnerable. For a change.
1318245455759839241 2020-10-20 01:39:43 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @rjheathfield Is this public debate or party politics?
1318243784421986307 2020-10-20 01:33:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @37paday @DavidGHFrost @MichelBarnier No.
1318243469182312448 2020-10-20 01:31:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Whereas the church interfering in politics is a 'constructive precedent' is it? 🙄
1318242581202030592 2020-10-20 01:28:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @tony80554056 @BreitbartNews Will we say 'please'? 🙄
1318236105611890689 2020-10-20 01:02:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> We obviously have all the activist lawyers. Let's see if they actually manage to do it.
1318232983371907075 2020-10-20 00:50:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @frenchgranny We used to say, someone 'looks like death warmed up'.
1318229741573464064 2020-10-20 00:37:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Femi_Sorry @somersetlevel Yeah, Johnson was only a journalist, &amp; the Mayor of London for 8 years before he became an MP whereas you was a prefect for two years at school weren't you?
1318227246499364869 2020-10-20 00:27:21 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @wessextwo Well this won't help, just shows how far removed they are.
1318225999037870080 2020-10-20 00:22:24 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Maybe I have missed the point, as an atheist it is quite likely, but why is the church interfering in politics.
1318157208631336960 2020-10-19 19:49:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DrewHanny1 @IHeartDogs5678 Me too.
1318126976943689728 2020-10-19 17:48:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Crosscolin88 Take care of yourself &amp; family Brian.

1317909233736781830 2020-10-19 03:23:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @bianchiboy8 @JohnMurphy51 I know 3 people who have tested positive. One who was involved in the first batch of cases he tested positive  in February. And two who tested positive in the last week. One a teacher, one a nurse.
1317908056320114688 2020-10-19 03:19:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Jojones2762 Absolutely!
1317907635375656962 2020-10-19 03:17:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @johno_no @jamesian01 Well done!
1317903850850930690 2020-10-19 03:02:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @alexandrite31 Yes, if only the CCP would share their hmmm ... Covid strategy rather than sharing the virus with us.
1317903083901517824 2020-10-19 02:59:15 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @simongerrard18 @MailOnline Precisely😁
1317897069391192069 2020-10-19 02:35:21 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @alexandrite31 @blogspheare Totally.
1317896876604203009 2020-10-19 02:34:35 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Hmmm ... isn't that similar to what the UK government is doing?   Swedish to bring in local lockdowns as coronavirus cases rise  https://t.co/b3XmGMMNm3 via @MailOnline
1317895208990892033 2020-10-19 02:27:57 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ghost_wales Just moved up to 'beheading' rather than 'stabbing' on BBC News 24.
1317886150720225281 2020-10-19 01:51:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnMurphy51 I know a number of people.
1317883405871255555 2020-10-19 01:41:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @MajorityRules2 Work😢
1317830549231312898 2020-10-18 22:11:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Forthemanynott5 We only have a few options. A national lockdown for 2 to 3 weeks will have little impact &amp; they will end up extending it. Herd immunity &amp; locking away the old &amp; vulnerable is the highest risk strategy in case there is no herd immunity. A more localised approach makes best sense.
1317820600509992960 2020-10-18 21:31:29 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Ender1957 @BarristersHorse Agree.
1317815287207657472 2020-10-18 21:10:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @BarristersHorse Do we need to?
1317813766139109376 2020-10-18 21:04:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @bluenobby Agreed but if you use a smartphone you already share your data. The only way to be safe is to not use modern technology. But this data is not about the app. This is about the test and trace system.
1317812184550957056 2020-10-18 20:58:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Forthemanynott5 That's not different. We did it in March &amp; April and it bought us some time. We cannot afford to do this again.
1317811643309576194 2020-10-18 20:55:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @bluenobby This is not about the app, this is about people testing positive.
1317807131559665665 2020-10-18 20:37:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @upyourstoo @Union_Jacky @Rob_Kimbell Hmm ... well people just wouldn't pick her then would they. Doesn't answer why she's not on the list.
1317804773479940097 2020-10-18 20:28:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Nigel100007 Yes, my mother in law had a stroke and she couldn't speak, walk, go to the toilet or feed herself. The doctors will know. If he can stand trial then he should of course. And the police will not forget this one.
1317804053049581568 2020-10-18 20:25:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Does Femi actually exist in human form as he seems to pop up everywhere?  I'm thinking he may be some AI experiment gone well .... north.
1317802420186042373 2020-10-18 20:19:15 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Union_Jacky @Rob_Kimbell She quite rightly should appear on those lists too. Just wondered why she's not on this list.
1317802163440177152 2020-10-18 20:18:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Nigel100007 It doesn't sound like he's doing any claiming. Doctors need to make that assessment. It is not satisfactory but it is the law.
1317801840902287360 2020-10-18 20:16:57 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LeghNicki No there were witnesses I believe. It's nothing to do with the evidence it's because he can't defend himself. That's just the law.
1317801405495840771 2020-10-18 20:15:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @katieeeeebell Is it the meaning of life?
1317800635350290437 2020-10-18 20:12:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LeghNicki Same reason you can't put dead people on trial.
1317800263776899073 2020-10-18 20:10:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Nigel100007 As it would be if he had died I suppose. So long as he does stand trial if he recovers mental capacity then there's not much else that can be done I guess.
1317799581007122432 2020-10-18 20:07:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Rob_Kimbell Why not list Margaret Thatcher? Not that I'm saying she did a lot of damage but was a more significant PM than any of the others.
1317798420573265920 2020-10-18 20:03:21 +0800 <JustineClaire65> State of your reply. If people want to wear a poppy or kneel for BLM, or their God that is their right in a free society.  What they should not be is compelled to do these things because that is where totalitarianism lies.
1317797085958279168 2020-10-18 19:58:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Paralysed and brain-damaged 'cop killer' may never be brought to trial  https://t.co/zTFhHnJPzA
1317794874662539265 2020-10-18 19:49:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Anyone seen a denial?
1317767334778503169 2020-10-18 17:59:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lbc Typical Labour to apply a national lockdown so that we are all lowered to a bottom baseline even though nearly half the country are in Tier 1. How about we pump extra resources into the north because they have it bad and have been neglected by the Labour Party for years.
1317754018379276288 2020-10-18 17:06:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Gove cannot be blamed for not reaching an FTA with the EU. The EU do not want the UK to exist as a separate sovereign nation. Allowing that will destroy the EU. If the UK flourish outside then why should countries remain. #marr
1317751305373470720 2020-10-18 16:56:08 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Given our reaction to Ferrier's blatant disrespect for Covid rules I would suggest that most people would like the police to be dealing with people who act like her.  #marr
1317747880531210240 2020-10-18 16:42:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Interesting interview with Dawn French who admits she wouldn't want to be a young comedian now because there are groups of people you cannot offend now. #Marr.
1317746691689283584 2020-10-18 16:37:48 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Nigel100007 Labour were stupid to not elect him leader when he was contending for it.
1317745430134968320 2020-10-18 16:32:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Labour Party using second lockdown as a political football. Shameful. #marr
1317744943742537729 2020-10-18 16:30:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Boris Johnson needs to understand that the levelling up that he promised during his campaign for the north of England needs to start now, with Covid. People will stop complying if they cannot afford to support their families. #marr

1317489627494797314 2020-10-17 23:36:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> An innocent man, a teacher, was beheaded in Paris because he taught freedom of expression in a free country.  You are so f****d up with your fake bandwagon nonsense that you have lost any trace of human compassion.  You disgust me.
1317478145759629327 2020-10-17 22:50:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Freedom of speech is always worth fighting for. Especially when the majority are being terrorised into silence because a small, angry, minority is offended.  Beheadings and 'correcting' history is not a sign of progress. It is not a part of my culture.

1317136755246714888 2020-10-17 00:14:08 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Quote of the day for me Boris.

1316439197599793152 2020-10-15 02:02:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Starmer backed Remain.  He kneeled to the marxist, extremist #BLM.  He calls for a second lockdown.  He makes the wrong decisions.  Consistently.

1316410455016058882 2020-10-15 00:08:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TelfordVictim The local authority must house you or find suitable accommodation because you are pregnant.
1316409751396380678 2020-10-15 00:05:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> In your eyes everything Johnson does is a disaster. Second lockdown would be a disaster, no second lockdown would be a disaster.  You are a journalistic disaster.
1316389146257174531 2020-10-14 22:43:24 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @cosby72 @StigAbell Hmm .. the jury is out on masks agreed but I would rather go with the guidance because I'd feel a fool if it turned out I was wrong. No proven harm done by wearing one either. You cannot maintain the 2m rule at all times but you can try. Enough of us try and we reduce the spread.
1316346244248358912 2020-10-14 19:52:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @StigAbell Yes, those without symptoms are supposed to be social distancing and wearing masks in certain situations and following the rule of 6. Exactly to slow the spread. I have no time for anyone not self isolating who has symptoms.

1315970264476377089 2020-10-13 18:58:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @suepb2 @PetuniaSmith6 I think a lot of things are tabled but they don't all get implemented. I don't think people see the point of masks outside when you can maintain a distance. Same with the circuit breaker lockdown. It may happen but it hasn't yet because they need people to buy in for it to work.

When she should have self isolated with symptoms!

He is employed by the PM and if the PM is dissatisfied with him then he can fire him. Most employed people are in that position. And Cummings advises, Johnson decides. Johnson is accountable for his decisions which may or may not be influenced by Cummings.

I just find it frustrating when people go, "ah well it's dead simple, just lock up all the vulnerable and we can go on partying". I know that's not from you, but it is from others.
1315284954624950272 2020-10-11 21:35:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @FoxxysTweets @HelenBarbaraSmi If a vaccine never happens then we will be asking vulnerable people to lock themselves away indefinitely. Because it will be too risky for them to step out. I wonder what we would think of that if we were vulnerable?
1315283423678922752 2020-10-11 21:29:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @FoxxysTweets @HelenBarbaraSmi I'm not sure I want to live in a society that would rather effectively 'lock up' its vulnerable because some people couldn't cope with not having a drink after 10pm. Feels very shallow and uncaring to me.
1315282618368307201 2020-10-11 21:26:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @FoxxysTweets @HelenBarbaraSmi If enough vulnerable people feel they have no choice because they want to have some quality of life then our hospitals will be overwhelmed and we will all suffer because we won't get access to other treatments. And lose loved ones prematurely.
1315281803465437186 2020-10-11 21:23:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @HelenBarbaraSmi @FoxxysTweets I totally agree. We all need to do our bit to protect each other. I know @FoxxysTweets comes from a good place but there is no great way out of this and it is everyone's problem.
1315278078894108673 2020-10-11 21:08:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @FoxxysTweets @HelenBarbaraSmi What about vulnerable people who live with their families? Does the whole family need to be isolated?
1315274232348250112 2020-10-11 20:53:08 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LiarBloody Probably involves a lot of mirrors🙄
1315273951535390721 2020-10-11 20:52:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TheColourOfHear I tend to be on the whole optimistic and I do hope that we get a vaccine soon so that the vulnerable have something to let them be free again. We are still talking about what the govt must do and not what each of us must do.

You refuse to do that because of your political allegiance &amp; not because of the facts of the case. Cummings is an advisor, she is a law maker.

You do realise if we go down the herd immunity route and you have got this wrong thousands will die unnecessarily of Covid and other illnesses because the hospitals won't cope?
1314890575406133248 2020-10-10 19:28:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @FridgeBoris When he retires from F1 he'll probably blame the industry for not doing enough about that.
1314889915969277954 2020-10-10 19:26:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @markgoodall9 I made myself read to the end. I'm a masochist.
1314889415446142976 2020-10-10 19:24:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnLibNat I have no idea why you think I have to stop. Do you want me to stop expressing my views? I'm not going to do that. I tolerate your different view. Try doing the same. I hope you get yourself back on track but don't actually see the point in continuing down this rabbit hole.
1314888666075062273 2020-10-10 19:21:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnLibNat I choose to get out of bed in the morning that's my first risk of the day. I agree those people who decided to sail off into the unknown took big risks that moved us forward. This is not the same though is it.
1314887506886897670 2020-10-10 19:16:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnLibNat We can wait that long, because we may have no choice. And because I different views from you please don't feel the need to try to put me down. I am not employed by Bill Gates, I work for a charity that houses people in need. I do a worthwhile job.
1314886214353399809 2020-10-10 19:11:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnLibNat I was a student in the 1980s so I have also been through that. Lots of people did not follow the guidance then even though that virus was 100% deadly so not like Covid. However, Covid is more infectious. Anyone who tells you when this all ends is a liar. Nobody knows.
1314884145181609984 2020-10-10 19:03:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnLibNat When we have effective treatments and possibly a vaccine I suspect.
1314883457961668608 2020-10-10 19:00:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnLibNat Those hospitals were moth balled as far as I understand so could be reopened if we need to. But if the virus is running riot in hospitals then of course they will not cope. The NHS is there for us but if it is overwhelmed then it cannot do an effective job.
1314882302460268544 2020-10-10 18:55:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> We need to protect ourselves &amp; our vulnerable friends &amp; family until we have better treatments &amp; a vaccine. We just all need to stop overthinking and blaming everyone for everything and do our bit, do what we can to help get us all through this difficult time. 4/4
1314882140190978049 2020-10-10 18:55:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So we don't want a lockdown but we can't just let the virus spread exponentially or our hospitals will be overwhelmed. We need to come to terms with the fact that social distancing, washing hands &amp; not mixing as much indoors is here to stay. 3/4
1314881688770670592 2020-10-10 18:53:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Deep down most of us know Covid is something real, big &amp; scary. We know  if we locked ourselves away for 6 months it would only go away until we opened up again. Most of us accept a lock down only slows the spread and causes different, possibly worse damage. 2/4
1314881535456219137 2020-10-10 18:52:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Covid &amp; Brexit to some extent has convinced me that we, the regular people of western countries, are in danger of overthinking issues. We push our noses down rabbit holes and follow red herrings. We lose sight of the bigger picture, distracted by the #ScumMedia 1/4

1314850461942517760 2020-10-10 16:49:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JST9 Yes and not because they are 'frightened' of a fine, or because they are a sheep, but because they think it may help and isn't a big sacrifice.
1314840126250516480 2020-10-10 16:08:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Union_Jacky @talkRADIO @mrmarkdolan They don't know how long the anti bodies last.   They don't know if having anti bodies prevents you from getting it. You may still catch it and have a mild version.  They don't know whether Trump seems better because of those drugs. He may have had mild symptoms anyway.
1314837105630228481 2020-10-10 15:56:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @rippedoffbykev @talkRADIO @mrmarkdolan Do you believe that treatments for other diseases would become more available if hospitals are struggling to cope with accelerated numbers of Covid cases? Likely to happen if we follow a herd immunity strategy.  Herd immunity is a very high risk strategy until there is a vaccine.
1314833877131841536 2020-10-10 15:43:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I shopped at Tesco yesterday, the only person I noticed without a mask was a young child. I didn't think he was an alien.
1314832260860915712 2020-10-10 15:36:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @talkRADIO @mrmarkdolan Has herd immunity been proven for Covid19 then? Because it's a very high risk strategy otherwise.

1314814837650862085 2020-10-10 14:27:40 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Kenhsilver @gerryoliver1 Yes, our govt is constantly criticised for at the same time not doing enough, quickly enough &amp; taking away our freedoms. C4 have been relentlessly attacking Trump &amp; the BBC sneer when they mention his name. But Ken it hasn't yet got me to the point of feeling sorry for Sturgeon😁
1314813603086823424 2020-10-10 14:22:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @stayontheleft @lewis_goodall Young people tend to not vote Tory it goes with the territory. They think the left are the good guys. Remember to tell them who introduced the fees and had the ridiculous policy of sending 50% to Uni which probably suits only 25%.
1314811037414285312 2020-10-10 14:12:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> You offer nothing. Engage local leaders in lockdown areas &amp; improve testing. Both things that the govt are doing.  You haven't been constructive, you have been destructive and a lot of us can never vote for you because of your dishonesty with Brexit &amp; your kneeling to extremism.
1314808395048923136 2020-10-10 14:02:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @cpmasterson @HIP_Energy @AlStewartOBE She called for Cummings to go and he didn't put anyone at risk. She's a hypocrite who has let everyone down. Her leader has asked her to resign. It is a big public interest story. Enough reason as to why this is still a story?

1314646799299248128 2020-10-10 03:19:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon That's not personal wealth is it. Try again.

1314645231325908993 2020-10-10 03:13:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon This has never changed in this country. Tell me when we had a consensus to let the state take away anyone's wealth.
1314636479847686147 2020-10-10 02:38:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @terrygeorge654 @Dojo50113598 Come back and tell me about it when 'they' do.
1314636252189257728 2020-10-10 02:38:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon But there is social consensus. We believe that if we own something or have inherited wealth that the state has no right to take that from us. We accept that there may be a tax implication but nothing more.
1314629579638702081 2020-10-10 02:11:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon Yes, &amp; you think it appropriate for the state to have the right to take it away. I think you'll find most people are not with you on this. Because it belongs to them whether they earned it or inherited it. Anything else is theft.
1314583161817440257 2020-10-09 23:07:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon It isn't for 'society' to decide what I do with my wealth. That's for me to decide. If you are suggesting that society should 'redistribute' wealth then I guess you'd better make sure that every society does it at the same time because the wealthy would be off like a shot.
1314582413759176704 2020-10-09 23:04:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @EnoughPowell @Dojo50113598 I really can't follow your argument at all. Maybe that's my fault. But I doubt it.
1314581562365796352 2020-10-09 23:00:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @terrygeorge654 @Dojo50113598 Hmmm ... or maybe it is not the easy &amp; obvious solution that you suggested. Which might explain why no country has actually gone down that route. Even Sweden.
1314550897251356674 2020-10-09 20:58:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @terrygeorge654 @Dojo50113598 But for your shielding the vulnerable approach to work they would have to isolate themselves because the rest of us are likely infected with Covid. If they venture out they will become infected and then we will have a problem with the NHS. So they better comply or it won't work.
1314532572773462017 2020-10-09 19:46:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @terrygeorge654 @Dojo50113598 Ok there are about 2 million I believe who need to shield. So effectively we would put these people under house arrest, with their families in some cases, alone in others, for an indefinite period. No contact with family in other households. Yeah, no problem.
1314531420900122624 2020-10-09 19:41:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @EnoughPowell @Dojo50113598 If we had known they had Covid then we would have intervened. So what's your point?
1314530943613513729 2020-10-09 19:39:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon They are talking about billionaires here but it is people with any wealth being criticised often. So there is a disparity in all societies because of luck of birth. So if I was a billionaire I would leave that wealth to my child. Why wouldn't I?
1314515609045082113 2020-10-09 18:38:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @terrygeorge654 @Dojo50113598 But you seem to be looking at this as if Boris is being more draconian than other leaders. He's clearly not. There really is only Sweden which has less restrictions than the England. Scotland, Wales &amp; NI are tougher and so are most European countries.
1314478552146997249 2020-10-09 16:11:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @simongerrard18 I agree.

1314444390664933409 2020-10-09 13:55:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon Hmm... in some cliche maybe. Socialists don't like anyone having more than anyone else. Everyone should be poor.  I didn't inherit anything myself but have been fortunate enough to buy a house. My son may inherit that unless I need the money for my care. And that's how it works.
1314280726146224130 2020-10-09 03:05:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @FrogAlaPeche Keep everyone poor that's literally socialism.
1314273918706950150 2020-10-09 02:38:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @FrogAlaPeche Yeah, everyone with wealth is bad. That's socialism for me🙄

1313839577061363713 2020-10-07 21:52:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @emmakennytv If you were faced with the stark choice of letting a baby live or an 81 yr old then even the 81 yr old may be with you on that. But we are not facing that stark choice are we? By taking a bit of care we don't kill old people &amp; the baby's future will likely be unaffected.

1313834524644696065 2020-10-07 21:32:15 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TheBulldog74 It is a racist comment but it doesn't mean the person saying it is a racist. They would have to treat black/white people differently to be classed as a racist imo.

1313531184228511745 2020-10-07 01:26:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @BBCNews very comfortable with reporting on child sex abuse within the Church of England, which is good.  Not so comfortable with reporting on Pakistani heritage Muslim grooming gangs.

I know we haven't always done great things but then which countries have? I love this quirky country that punches above its weight. I don't understand the problem.

1313483091051261953 2020-10-06 22:15:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @mitsyarty @RolandFSmith Me too but I'm also bemused because I normally have a worked through theory for everything &amp; no matter how much I read around stuff I really haven't figured this. I know things are complex but this seems to go against nature. We tend to protect our family or tribe, not undermine.
1313480148218458113 2020-10-06 22:04:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @RolandFSmith @mitsyarty This is the most important question that Jo is asking. A sizeable minority of white British people have become ashamed &amp; antagonistic towards their own culture. I continually try to understand why this has happened. It is very destructive &amp; divisive. Like an autoimmune disease.
1313461115523866626 2020-10-06 20:48:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Nigel100007 Too true😁

1313383262056837120 2020-10-06 15:39:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @BillChristie15 I wouldn't because I know myself. I'm inclined to follow rules but only where they make sense to me.

1313124059887161344 2020-10-05 22:29:07 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ejectamenta_com If they wait until its surging then they have waited too long as we know there is around a three week lag.
1313123760816508931 2020-10-05 22:27:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ejectamenta_com I don't go down this it's ok for elderly people to die route. It isn't.  We have no idea how many people have been infected in the UK so we don't know the death rate.  Twice as many people have died of Covid than flu in a bad flu year already.
1313118856928468996 2020-10-05 22:08:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ejectamenta_com People are dying now but not in the numbers but there are still tight restrictions which mean the spread is reduced. I assume you would accept responsibility if we took the foot off &amp; the death started again with our hospitals being overwhelmed. Because that's the reality.
1313118591424831488 2020-10-05 22:07:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Helen29260350 @newscomauHQ I'm not convinced, I think they were panicked by what was happening in Italy where their health system was being overwhelmed. I remember being really surprised when Italy followed China's lead because it didn't seem likely liberal democracies would comply.
1313116906103201795 2020-10-05 22:00:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LuggJudith I've found the same really. I moved to TalkRadio from LBC and now listen to neither very often. I think people are just fed up with the situation and want to rage at someone. He's the PM so it must be him🙄
1313115950942744576 2020-10-05 21:56:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ejectamenta_com I'm just saying that no one followed Sweden's approach, we don't know for certain which approach was the best yet &amp; there were differences in infection levels in Sweden &amp; UK. I don't think you can pick up just the one case that exists &amp; say that Johnson screwed up.
1313080566334599168 2020-10-05 19:36:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ejectamenta_com That's the only country that didn't lock down. But we don't know how their economy has faired because in the global market we are all reliant on each-other, they rely on other countries. If BJ hadn't locked down there would have been many more deaths, cases were out of control.

1313079283699585024 2020-10-05 19:31:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @RL50031 We haven't got Brino.   Taking away freedoms is not something that comes naturally to a libertarian like Johnson. But with a health emergency we do things for the greater good, temporarily. But then those who have a problem with him don't believe this is a health emergency.
1313077734957080576 2020-10-05 19:25:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Helen29260350 @newscomauHQ Interesting but there are gaps. China reporting that people were crammed together in Water Parks because the virus has gone cannot be believed any more than anything else they put out. And Sage advocated lockdown so we are saying scientists are influenced by social media?
1313069833173569537 2020-10-05 18:53:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AndyDal02045409 Agreed, constructive criticism is appropriate and certainly not slavish agreement. But recently I think the criticism has not been in any way constructive from some people. Rather nasty &amp; unhelpful from some.

1313030926360813570 2020-10-05 16:19:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jeremyjhowes I think that's harsh because of Covid but fair in terms of illegal immigration.

1313025832223494144 2020-10-05 15:58:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @SilviaNewman4 Well I'm a BP supporter too but they gave me no one to vote for at the GE so that's not much use really is it. I can't change anything if I have no one to vote for. By standing candidates down Farage gave support to Johnson.
1313024379874357251 2020-10-05 15:53:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @mark1854now Did you read the bit about me never having voted Tory🤨
1313024030493020161 2020-10-05 15:51:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Simonablake @stephen89566950 @LozzaFox I suppose it's true to say that he cannot KNOW it to be untrue.   I guess that's the same reasoning you may use when calling him a racist t**t.   The lesson might be to think before you use such language casually because it hurts doesn't it.
1313019165293281282 2020-10-05 15:32:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @nobdy_imp Yes, you are probably right.

1312840671334629377 2020-10-05 03:43:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @555jammy @susanstanwix I think a lot of people chose to ignore Johnson's 'liberal' attitude to things like illegal immigration because they believed he would get Brexit done. I don't think he has changed position tbf. Him catching Covid was unfortunate but didn't change much.
1312836554495348739 2020-10-05 03:26:40 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Mikey1732 I'd never forgive myself if I passed it on to someone vulnerable and that's why I can't get my head around that mentality tbh.
1312835072748392448 2020-10-05 03:20:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JamesH1834 Oh sorry, my mistake. I just do not have the conspiracy theorist's imagination.

Sadly when Boris asked people to observe restrictions, a lot didn't and the cases were out of control and we had no option at that point but to lockdown.

Not an excuse just an observation. People never like to talk about the downside of immigration do they. And if they do it becomes a debate about racism, so we don't.

I was shouting to not have a lockdown as I believed that infringed my freedoms, I didn't appreciate the gravity of the situation &amp; I would have preferred people to act responsibly. As the evidence grew I changed my mind.
1312727278485491713 2020-10-04 20:12:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TNellster @joannenorwich There's a difference between a reason and an excuse. Actually we can say that we have the nth highest obesity level in the world. I wouldn't be proud of that but I wouldn't blame Boris Johnson for it. And the population density is enhanced by mass immigration over recent decades.
1312725819974995970 2020-10-04 20:06:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ReaperSteven @StephenHunt14 Struggling to understand the meaning of the word observation... let me help.  The definition of an observation is the act of noticing something or a judgment or inference from something seen or experienced.  You're welcome.
1312724674489593856 2020-10-04 20:02:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ReaperSteven @Bignozer Cummings is an employee. He is an advisor. Politicians employ advisors because they need experts &amp; specialists because they don't know everything. Thatcher had advisors🤦🏻‍♀️ Get a grip.
1312723775847362560 2020-10-04 19:58:32 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @OCunasa Greenland🤦🏻‍♀️   Can't argue with that.
1312723245871882240 2020-10-04 19:56:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Joogle13831130 @likesbaking That was not my argument. The UK definitely hasn't handled the pandemic as well as Germany. But they have not handled it any worse than France, Spain, Italy, Belgium &amp; others. We didn't overwhelm the NHS and we have the highest test capacity in Europe &amp; got our PPE supply sorted.
1312722201989308417 2020-10-04 19:52:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ReaperSteven @Bignozer Hmmm .. yeah 'course🙄
1312721422985424896 2020-10-04 19:49:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Yes, he has been disappointing on a number of those issues I agree.
1312720876102717441 2020-10-04 19:47:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @OCunasa You mean Germany? Because most other countries didn't.
1312720669956866048 2020-10-04 19:46:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Joogle13831130 @likesbaking Your opinion and not based on fact.
1312720554294681601 2020-10-04 19:45:43 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GartsideJackie Ridiculous. China is totalitarianism get some perspective. You can develop treatments rather than let people die unnecessarily. People can access cancer treatments now. It was under lockdown where there were access issues. Often because people were frightened of catching Covid!
1312719284993429504 2020-10-04 19:40:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TNellster @joannenorwich Depends how you measure this I know. But you cannot say it's Johnson's fault because there are reasons why some countries are more prone to the fast spread than others. Population density, obesity etc  https://t.co/e2zx1lVZu4
1312718094775783424 2020-10-04 19:35:57 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ReaperSteven @StephenHunt14 It was an observation. He didn't make anything up.
1312717708660748290 2020-10-04 19:34:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ChrisKeelty So your argument is that we went into lockdown too late? France had cases before the UK and went into lockdown on 17th. We went into lockdown 6 days later. I believe Boris's instinct was to go down the Swedish route but people just didn't follow the rules voluntarily when asked.
1312716328436932609 2020-10-04 19:28:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @elainecoulson58 It's nonsense. This is a public health emergency and that means we all have to do things we don't want to. Some of us get on with it and some of us rail against it.
1312715404771549186 2020-10-04 19:25:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GartsideJackie Look at what's happening in the rest of the world, he's not acting differently. There are treatments for Covid being developed all the time. We can stop viruses killing millions of people though can't we. Eg HIV.
1312714792931659782 2020-10-04 19:22:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @elainecoulson58 Yes, I get where you are coming from but I don't agree. Who is the global attacker and why are they doing it? Without those questions answered the conspiracy theories just don't stack up.
1312712770496978944 2020-10-04 19:14:48 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jeffmas1 They haven't eradicated it. We just don't get to hear about it. Like we don't get to hear about whether this whole thing started accidentally in China or deliberately in China.
1312712143586852867 2020-10-04 19:12:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @werleaving We need to have a look at how Sweden got on when this is over. They should of course be compared to similar countries like Denmark &amp; Norway. You must also remember that the government tried to get us to act responsibly - the Swedish approach - and we didn't seem able to.
1312711037045690370 2020-10-04 19:07:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @elainecoulson58 I don't accept the conspiracy theories, nor that all the scientists are  in someone's pockets.  Why do they continue to damage their careers, the reputation of scientists generally and destroy our economies? For what purpose.
1312710185824251904 2020-10-04 19:04:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jon6381 @gymslip But I don't accept your premise that using the private sector who can mobilise quickly is a bad thing. This is how capitalism works. Are you a socialist?
1312709638530510849 2020-10-04 19:02:21 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Chrissytn1 @SMCK_99 We just disagree on "sense". Carry on as if nothing is happening in the face of a global pandemic makes no sense to me.
1312709174036496384 2020-10-04 19:00:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @elainecoulson58 No he must listen to scientists because this is a virus fgs. He's not being wishy washy he's being open. There is no simple answer to any of this. He is actually treating us like adults and I think that may be his greatest mistake.
1312708278036688909 2020-10-04 18:56:57 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Chrissytn1 @SMCK_99 Yes you are right and the rest of the world has just over-reacted🙄
1312707757250932737 2020-10-04 18:54:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Sharon69794082 @elsadog_ @Brimmy1967 You might but you would have been condemning vulnerable people to an almost certain death. These are the people who die of Covid. Many people are frightened to go to hospital because of Covid. Imagine how they would feel if it was just running rife. None of this is easy is it.
1312694671236370432 2020-10-04 18:02:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @elsadog_ @Brimmy1967 I never understand this argument. The purpose of lockdown and restrictions is to slow the spread so that hospitals would not be overwhelmed. You would rather have kept hospitals open for business and cancer patients would have died of covid instead?
1312693348839415808 2020-10-04 17:57:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ToffeeM05751186 @gymslip Yes, this says that they have dropped face masks on public transport mainly because there are so few cases in NZ (Auckland still has restrictions) People aren't wearing them because they don't see the point ie few cases. When the virus comes back, masks will be back too.
1312691664306294785 2020-10-04 17:50:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jeremy_hume @gymslip @ChrisKeelty No I'm sure you are not. But many more think this is a public health emergency and that we need to behave differently until a more long term solution is found.
1312690973881913344 2020-10-04 17:48:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @SandDancer9 @SMCK_99 😁 Got to love Twitterland.
1312690530338381825 2020-10-04 17:46:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @gymslip @ToffeeM05751186 Totally. A lot of NZ citizens are not happy with those draconian measures.
1312682768095207425 2020-10-04 17:15:35 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @likesbaking Germany have handled this much better than we have. They did have some advantages over us which allowed them to nip the exponential rise that we had in the bud. We have increased and surpassed their testing capacity now. We have learned.
1312681508818350081 2020-10-04 17:10:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ChrisKeelty Yes, I haven't forgotten anything. Back then we didn't know what we know now. I'm not questioning that mistakes have been made, my argument is that all government's have made mistakes. Learning from them is the key thing, rather than getting stuck in them.
1312680651762675712 2020-10-04 17:07:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jon6381 Most countries use the private sector to deliver services, especially when they have to mobilise quickly.
1312677889389846530 2020-10-04 16:56:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WendyRo11208996 😂

1312677612226064384 2020-10-04 16:55:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Some people find it difficult to accept that the government does not have all the answers to Covid and that they will make mistakes.  Every government will make mistakes, the important thing is what we learn and how we move on.  #Marr
1312673794117562368 2020-10-04 16:39:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ToffeeM05751186 They appeared to temporarily eradicate it, then got 4 cases in Auckland and went into a second lockdown.   We need perspective.
1312673114137001984 2020-10-04 16:37:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Just to point out that Boris Johnson didn't create Covid19 and there is no country that has eradicated it, nor got through it without damage to the economy.  Some perspective would be good.   #Marr
1312671648689127430 2020-10-04 16:31:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So the Shadow Health Minister believes that politicians make mistakes with Covid rules. Guess which former leader politician he was being asked about🤨  Bloody hypocrites #Marr
1312670737346560000 2020-10-04 16:27:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So I think the Shadow Health Minister is saying he supports the government's local lockdown approach. But he doesn't support the government's local lockdown approach.  Hmmm ... that's cleared it up🙄 #Marr
1312669113530101760 2020-10-04 16:21:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Is anyone really surprised that the Trump machine is giving a positive spin on his condition? Any world leader would do that fgs #marr
1312666351522254848 2020-10-04 16:10:21 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @oenanthe54 Very different for Boris Johnson then?#marr

1312651210307055617 2020-10-04 15:10:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @scrilldeberbw @TrevorBall63 An elected MP one of only 650 people in the country who is responsible for passing law. Law that she broke.
1312498140361105408 2020-10-04 05:01:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @HackettNicholas She is an elected member of parliament. She votes in parliament to make law. Dominic Cummings is a government advisor.
1312466028601864193 2020-10-04 02:54:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Let's see the police charge her as she has broken the law.
1312446574669099009 2020-10-04 01:37:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Dustmopp31 Pernod, and I never have.

She felt better and travelled to London on Monday, got the test results Tuesday and went home. She notified bosses on Wednesday.
1312444499231076352 2020-10-04 01:28:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @allisonpearson @Emu52May @UsforThemUK Although of course this has not been suggested.

1312439249971494912 2020-10-04 01:07:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @2xDutch31 Because she is an elected member of parliament. There are only 650 of them.
1312439017166651392 2020-10-04 01:07:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @gtinebike They did get as far as Durham with Cummings, to doorstep his family.
1312438738375471105 2020-10-04 01:05:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AlanGoodfellow9 Interpretation. I'm not saying that he is wrong. I'm saying that I'm not convinced that he is right. There is a difference you know.

1312332494054850561 2020-10-03 18:03:43 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @MechEngineerB You really think the #ScumMedia are this sensitive? This is all about their politics and nothing about their sex, Covid19 or breaking rules.
1312331629906493440 2020-10-03 18:00:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @N7Kopper No way. This is all about politics, nothing about principles or truth.

1312328368185057281 2020-10-03 17:47:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AlanGoodfellow9 I have listened to Ivor many times and still do but I’m not convinced by him and I listen to others too.

1312320245303054336 2020-10-03 17:15:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Yes, I think they have just hospitalised Trump because of a tickly cough and a slight sniffle.
1312318179922907137 2020-10-03 17:06:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @campbellclaret You lack consistency and integrity. If you called for one to resign you must call for the other.  The truth is you don't actually care about anything just your desire to get rid of people who don't have your worldview.   Which is most of us btw.
1312314669802151937 2020-10-03 16:52:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @HookyGolfer @MattHancock I think it may be called "research".

1312038124697145344 2020-10-02 22:34:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon No that isn't the question. The question is how do we distribute the money we would otherwise invest in the EU into our own economy, solely. Nice position to be in seeing as we paid more in than we ever got out.
1312011324138942466 2020-10-02 20:47:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon You may have notice that we are still paying into the EU as we have always done in the interim. You cannot judge anything until we are properly out which is 1/1/2021. And in reality that may be a tad too soon to judge how well its going. But you like to peddle hysteria don't you.
1311912352774868992 2020-10-02 14:14:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Except Cummings didn't put anyone else at risk. If he had risked the HOC and the general public he'd be gone now and I would have called for that too.  Stop trying to conflate and hoping to detract. We see through it.🤨
1311910602714099717 2020-10-02 14:07:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> "Mistake"🤨
1311908978352246785 2020-10-02 14:00:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Had she downloaded the app? Anyone getting a notification who travelled on the train from and to Scotland may be able to narrow the epicentre for this one down🤨   Or in the House of Commons🙄
1311906371848335361 2020-10-02 13:50:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon Yeah, you see you remembered that one. It was catchy wasn't it.
1311750067427123202 2020-10-02 03:29:21 +0800 <JustineClaire65> It's just not catchy Femi😉
1311747114079318017 2020-10-02 03:17:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @glynmorgan3921 I think she's gone.
1311745645598969857 2020-10-02 03:11:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Are they waiting for Godot?
1311745218866278402 2020-10-02 03:10:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Wow and they have managed to keep it secret? Just the schools and police know this, so a tight knit group😉
1311743286932103168 2020-10-02 03:02:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Channel4News It must have really hurt for Jon Snow to say that immigrants wanted to cross illegally into the UK because the UK is not racist and treats people well. But I thought we were terrible, you must put those poor ill informed immigrants straight @jonsnowC4 right now.🤷🏻‍♀️
1311741511189569539 2020-10-02 02:55:21 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @teresadg0 I've done it a few times but about Covid not Brexit. For having a different opinion. Crazy times😁

1311640837047160837 2020-10-01 20:15:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ronnocm2 That's exactly what it looks like.

1311626805615435776 2020-10-01 19:19:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @bigstrongmo That's a good call and I'm in touch with my inner and outer gammon so should work😉
1311626061709479936 2020-10-01 19:16:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @bigstrongmo White is not a very practical colour anymore🙄
1311625363336896514 2020-10-01 19:13:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JST9 Hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths are the indicators that we need to keep an eye on.
1311624984540909574 2020-10-01 19:12:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Taylod61 Agreed.
1311624699198218240 2020-10-01 19:11:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Why? Is red a reminder of some shocking past misdemeanour that we all haven't a clue about but should be terribly ashamed of?  I can't keep up with the wokery.
1311623244026388482 2020-10-01 19:05:24 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @FlowerP79667758 Riesling
1311567670169538560 2020-10-01 15:24:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @CarolineHutt I have no time for these people who trash their own country, their government, their fellow citizens. Think everywhere and anywhere else is better. Not only that, they are a miserable bunch too.
1311566564412526592 2020-10-01 15:20:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Hedonistal @Channel4News @krishgm This is what happens.   There is a democratic system which isn't perfect. None are.  We get a result some don't like.   They say the democratic system is broken. They try to get lots of people to buy into that. Trash it.  Let's try authoritarianism that works so much better🙄
1311565307840954368 2020-10-01 15:15:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jeremy_hume I pay a fine if I park on a double yellow line or if I travel at 80mph on the motorway, if I'm caught. I don't cry when others get away with it scot free.  I follow public health advice. I'm a sheeple &amp; I'm proud🤷🏻‍♀️
1311563434333532160 2020-10-01 15:07:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> You will not rest until we get a second lockdown will you. Nobody else wants one Laura including Boris Johnson.
1311561814950453250 2020-10-01 15:01:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Because we have never experienced it.
1311560072372400128 2020-10-01 14:54:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Hedonistal @Channel4News @krishgm And you lack any kind of intelligence if you lump nearly half the population of the US into a box labelled idiot.  I personally understand better why people vote Trump than people like you who believe that Trump should be cancelled. I suppose that's because I'm a democrat.
1311427918543888391 2020-10-01 06:09:15 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ProfKarolSikora @elliedionne @BorisJohnson Whitty said that at the conference, they have said it throughout. We understand what you are doing here and it is a deceit.
1311425621990535168 2020-10-01 06:00:08 +0800 <JustineClaire65> You’re not sure. The rest of us are sure.
1311424825588674561 2020-10-01 05:56:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Every time Boris Johnson says he’s going to do a briefing we get this ridiculous build up saying it means a second lockdown. Every bloody time. Can you please stop the hysteria. The real news is bad enough without this constant, ill-informed, second guessing. #ScumMedia
1311422140126822402 2020-10-01 05:46:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Hedonistal @Channel4News @krishgm Ah that gives him the right does it? It overrides democracy. I see. And if I refused to condemn witchcraft that makes me a witch does it?  No, we don’t all think like you, it doesn’t give them justification for biased reporting. Cancelling people leads to authoritarianism.
1311373596011507714 2020-10-01 02:33:24 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Hedonistal @Channel4News @krishgm This was tweeted before the debate. Are you referring to the legally elected POTUS when you say white supremacist?
1311372641564078082 2020-10-01 02:29:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I think @krishgm just nearly half of the US electorate (Trump supporters) far right militia. Even the American bloke he put the question to was shocked. @Channel4News has lost its way.
1311238430244974592 2020-09-30 17:36:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @OneEyeGrey @Get_Reallll @Fionalo53519376 @Channel4News @krishgm It is as true as your second sentence is sincere.
1311237396546154497 2020-09-30 17:32:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Nigel100007 @Channel4News @krishgm Spot on!
1311191309198254080 2020-09-30 14:29:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> The BBC standing proud behind their man Biden. Look at the headlines under the clips they chose to include.    Biden the teller of truths &amp; Trump the white supremacist. Impartial?   Errr... No.    https://t.co/QFHUwyMY4S

1311016608199061504 2020-09-30 02:54:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Has @Channel4News been employed by Joe Biden and the Democratic Party? Just watching @krishgm night after night ....
1310967648855953413 2020-09-29 23:40:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Sheikh_Anvakh @Brie0748 @gerardjasper Probably a lot tbf.

1310700442658254850 2020-09-29 05:58:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon You are a wet lettuce.
1310679421641043975 2020-09-29 04:35:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon You sound a bit envious Jack, is it hard to stomach that a female Brexit supporter may be able to get a job in your beloved EU when you can't. And to rub salt in the wound I'm not even slightly interested in doing so because I love my country.😁
1310673477565906944 2020-09-29 04:11:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @phgorleston @gerardjasper Weirdly true that isn't it😁
1310673189131911168 2020-09-29 04:10:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon Yeah ok Jack, isn't it time for you mum to tuck you up yet?
1310672208700866560 2020-09-29 04:06:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon I probably could as I work in IT but my family, friends and everything and everyone I want to be with lives here. In this amazing country.   The grass is always greener in this pleasant land😉
1310670380089122816 2020-09-29 03:59:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Brie0748 😂
1310668848086036485 2020-09-29 03:52:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @rjheathfield She should have asked Alice.
1310667123803463686 2020-09-29 03:46:07 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon People could travel before we joined the EU you do realise that don't you. If you find a job in another country you can live in that country, you do realise that too?
1310661697204563971 2020-09-29 03:24:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon No that's where you haven't got a clue.
1310660577333837824 2020-09-29 03:20:07 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon Go live somewhere where you'll be happier then.
1310641823086510085 2020-09-29 02:05:35 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon Yes, UK tax levels are exactly that - UK tax levels. Nothing to do with the EU.   We are out now so you just need to get over it.
1310639217119240192 2020-09-29 01:55:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> But these loopholes have existed throughout our membership of the EU. You are talking absolute rubbish.
1310635823558201345 2020-09-29 01:41:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon Barbados isn't in the EU when I last looked🙄
1310633895101169673 2020-09-29 01:34:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @tmthywinter People with degrees tend to earn more on average than those without so that's a fairly good investment too.
1310623623313530881 2020-09-29 00:53:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GGsnapper @BBCNews I live in a household so it's not just my decision to not pay the licence fee.
1310621867166838791 2020-09-29 00:46:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @UK_Optimist @BBCNews I know, it drives me nuts!
1310616666259230720 2020-09-29 00:25:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Except they haven't been offered.   But don't let the truth get in the way of a good lie.
1310615553644679171 2020-09-29 00:21:12 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ChrisJC12002 Absolutely, very interesting tweet.
1310615313516503040 2020-09-29 00:20:15 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Watching @BBCNews and the presenter keeps saying, 'some people think that the students should have not gone to Uni this year'. Who are these people? Because all the guests seem to think that they should have gone back!
1310612953876574210 2020-09-29 00:10:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TidyTops @BootHuckett In terms of the Human Rights Act they both are rights in law.  Article 2, Protocol 1: Right to education  "The Human Rights Act protects our right to an effective education within the UK's existing educational institutions. It relates to primary, secondary and higher education."
1310610796821598208 2020-09-29 00:02:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JCollinsLondon What the hell are you on about now? What has this got to do with Brexit fgs?
1310610121853153280 2020-09-28 23:59:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ChrisJC12002 The 'surprising' support for Covid restrictions will not work for climate change. For 3 reasons:  1. There are many more climate change sceptics. 2. There is no immediacy ie relatives/colleagues aren't dying from it.  3. There's a potential end to Covid ie vaccine/herd immunity.
1310603126869831685 2020-09-28 23:31:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Sounds a bit colonial to me🙄
1310600980149436417 2020-09-28 23:23:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> There were lots of apprenticeships available when my son left school he's 21 now. None when I left school in the 1980s. Massive unemployment.  At 18 you should have the choice of an apprenticeship or Uni, neither are a right.
1310588302517563392 2020-09-28 22:32:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TidyTops @BootHuckett Education? Or higher education?
1310501803855876096 2020-09-28 16:49:12 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @billyshaker I can't, as others in my household have different views but I no longer watch PL football and I don't do the PL Fantasy anymore. I was a very big fan up to the kneeling debacle. If they stop kneeling I'll start watching again.
1310500098850332673 2020-09-28 16:42:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jude561610 He was an immigrant although he was legal so that may make a difference.

1310318774533447680 2020-09-28 04:41:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Brie0748 Should be capped at 20% of population and therefore entry standards should be increased ie you need to do well in your A levels. There should be apprenticeships at 18 also funded by loans to teach people trades etc. One route for the academic and one for the practical. Sorted😁
1310315041019887616 2020-09-28 04:27:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Gypsy82190675 Bit shameful really.
1310314421739237377 2020-09-28 04:24:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DavidDavidida @SMCK_99 Me neither.

1310310128235745280 2020-09-28 04:07:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Amanita_virosa1 Yes, a totally flawed policy that means our universities are now amongst the most expensive to go to in the world. Our society is more unequal than its ever been. Labour failure.
1310309196366258188 2020-09-28 04:03:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GaryRumbell Collective amnesia?

1310283535626964992 2020-09-28 02:21:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Most of us mere mortals just have to accept new appointments at the top of places where we work. We can't afford to leave.

1310267983839850499 2020-09-28 01:20:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @roz_jabthehut @Mikey1732 I didn't vote Tory, never have. Would have voted for TBP if I had been given that chance. I have supported Boris and the government on both Brexit and Covid and continue to do so. Churchill was a great wartime PM.

1310265662204411911 2020-09-28 01:10:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TheTwatRises @Fairy_Woodland "A total of 5,693 people were registered as having tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, compared to 6,042 on Saturday.  And although those numbers showed a day-on-day fall, they represented a substantial rise from 3,899 last Sunday and 4,422 on the previous Saturday".

1310257292365959168 2020-09-28 00:37:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Mikey1732 Boris has got Brexit done, doesn't necessarily mean you need to vote Tory at every GE does it? After Brexit they have to deliver on the fall out from Covid. If they mess that up people will place their votes elsewhere, that's how democracy works.

1310168614121734144 2020-09-27 18:45:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ridgeisback @allxorxnothing There's treatments now yes. They came much later &amp; many died. We were all asked to take precautions because there was no known cure. I was at Uni in the 1980s. The difference with Covid is that it doesn't kill as many people but it kills more than flu &amp; is highly infectious.

1309864058284371969 2020-09-26 22:35:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @LennieStein @Emmacochrane9 @ArchRose90 Best in Europe but some Unis specialise in certain subjects and there are a lot of Scottish people live in England don't forget. Anyway you need the English students paying their fees to help pay for the free places so don't complain.

This has resulted in some UK students not being able to go to some UK universities for free when other EU students can.

1309850806267580416 2020-09-26 21:42:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Scotgirl6 @No431onthelist @SnowdropEdgar @ArchRose90 It is because every EU student pays the same at an English Uni. Everyone the same. At a Scottish Uni a Romanian student gets a free place an English student has to pay. A Romanian gets a free place. How hard is that to understand? Thought I'd repeat one last time.
1309848876103467009 2020-09-26 21:34:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Scotgirl6 @larson07 @ArchRose90 Worse for Scotland Unis because they used to get a place for free.
1309848470442913792 2020-09-26 21:33:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Scotgirl6 @SandraDodd47 @ArchRose90 I don't understand why you can't see the basic unfairness. Whoever is to blame is kind of irrelevant for ordinary people. Any EU student can win a free place at a Scottish Uni except an English student. English people paid into the EU pot and they support those free places.

We have (along with some in Scotland) the best Unis in Europe, and the world. There is an endless supply of international students wanting to study at the best unis.

In Scotland the Scottish &amp; Romanian students pay nothing. The English pay £9250 PA. That's my point.

However, the fees that they have to pay are enormous and you can see so much money sloshing around in Unis nowadays. Up to Covid at least.

1309763827563724800 2020-09-26 15:56:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ukblm issued a statement about the murder of a police officer yet?

Like non EU students subsidise English Unis I guess. The difference for me is that English students are effectively treated worse than other EU students in Scotland &amp; that just isn't right.

1309574716638801920 2020-09-26 03:25:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Emmacochrane9 @ArchRose90 The point that I was making was that English students can't get tuition fees free in Scottish unis unlike students from every other EU country. And there was no party who would have delivered zero tuition fees to vote for, so your argument is flawed.

1309541781084794883 2020-09-26 01:14:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @larson07 @ArchRose90 No it was Labour who introduced devolution and accepted this ridiculous situation where any EU student pays no tuition fees in Scottish Unis except the English. Ridiculous and unfair.
1309540918064807937 2020-09-26 01:10:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @larson07 @ArchRose90 No we cannot afford to pay tuition fees for 50% of students to go to Uni.  We could afford to if there was a lower percentage going to Uni. We could pay less than £9250 per year for sure but not nothing.
1309539668300623873 2020-09-26 01:06:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @larson07 @ArchRose90 No the UK tax payer pays towards it. The Scottish Govt cannot afford free everything without subsidy from the UK.
1309539083262271488 2020-09-26 01:03:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @larson07 @ArchRose90 Yes, I absolutely agree with the principle BUT my point is that English students were the only students in the EU who couldn't access it free. A Romanian (nothing against Romania btw) student gets free tuition but an English student doesn't.

1309537122169303041 2020-09-26 00:55:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jodonnell1 @ArchRose90 Yes, that would be so unfair wouldn't it🤨
1309536200147992577 2020-09-26 00:52:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @isobelc1951 @ArchRose90 Changes in 2021.
1309536098352328711 2020-09-26 00:51:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Emmacochrane9 @ArchRose90 All students at English Unis pay. At least Scottish students have a choice.
1309535399702933506 2020-09-26 00:49:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @larson07 @ArchRose90 There's no such thing as free tuition fees really is there. Someone pays. But for every other EU country to have free to student tuition fees in Scottish Unis except England does seem a tad wrong now doesn't it?
1309534106666008576 2020-09-26 00:43:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jodonnell1 @ArchRose90 Hmmm ... But it can afford to offer it free to the rest of the EU?
1309533781662072832 2020-09-26 00:42:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @larson07 @ArchRose90 Voted for what?
1309533619938091008 2020-09-26 00:41:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @larson07 @hincko1 @ArchRose90 UK tax payer? Or magic money tree?
1309525052304568321 2020-09-26 00:07:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @davemcardle @ArchRose90 Oh so it hasn't changed yet then?
1309524368771502081 2020-09-26 00:05:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @davemcardle @ArchRose90 When was that? This year?
1309518984887308289 2020-09-25 23:43:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Correction: "Murdered".  Hope you have stopped kneeling for an organisation that wants to defund the police now.
1309517460341653504 2020-09-25 23:37:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @hincko1 @ArchRose90 Spot on!
1309515893962149892 2020-09-25 23:31:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Fred52093826 Feels like a challenge😁
1309508160298811394 2020-09-25 23:00:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ArchRose90 Not that I'm bitter but Scottish students and EU students attending Scottish Unis don't pay any tuition fees.   English students pay £9250 PA for attending Scottish Unis.   The English never counted as an EU member even when the UK was an EU member.
1309505678768254976 2020-09-25 22:50:57 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @hungrus1 Yay! Do you know the account name?
1309497877627056129 2020-09-25 22:19:57 +0800 <JustineClaire65> But is it because she's BLACK or because she's a YOUNG WOMAN?  Not saying that's right either but why does everything have to be because of skin colour.
1309495749948968961 2020-09-25 22:11:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Lamplighter48 Tbf I never found him that funny before Brexit/Covid.
1309466412226883585 2020-09-25 20:14:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DavidBlakeman13 That's in French so I'm a bit clueless. I can't find anything anywhere else about it.
1309464348260216832 2020-09-25 20:06:43 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DavidBlakeman13 I can't find anything that substantiates this.
1309458374568878081 2020-09-25 19:42:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Keith02 @packetsniffer99 "Die from farting" made me think you lacked a bit of empathy. My mistake🤨
1309438369479512064 2020-09-25 18:23:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @zarosa I checked her account and it has been suspended by Twitter. She has a lot of followers.
1309438141523255298 2020-09-25 18:22:35 +0800 <JustineClaire65> It's a murder, not an incident.
1309437765327761410 2020-09-25 18:21:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> If we all just respected the job the police do like you Dawn😡
1309436882669969410 2020-09-25 18:17:35 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Brie0748 Oh I missed that.

1309435285814607872 2020-09-25 18:11:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @rjheathfield @WiganEverything If only I had your bank details🤷🏻‍♀️
1309434996189466624 2020-09-25 18:10:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @EileenTurner8 Yes do. Some of it is too close to the bone to retweet tbh. But appeals to my sense of humour😁
1309434540570574848 2020-09-25 18:08:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Note to self Femi - read through tweets prior to sending. Gives the impression that you are saying something that you have thought about for longer than a nanosecond.
1309433568712683525 2020-09-25 18:04:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @EileenTurner8 No I always tweet when I get blocked so can see the confusion.  I was surprised she made it this far tbh😁
1309432929265872896 2020-09-25 18:01:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WiganEverything Ginnel for me.
1309432458060980224 2020-09-25 18:00:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @EileenTurner8 Oh no she didn't block me, she's been restricted by Twitter. I just enjoy her parody account.
1309432161221697541 2020-09-25 17:58:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @zarosa Don't know just spotted it. Or did you mean why sad?
1309431254266372097 2020-09-25 17:55:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Can't believe that Labour are still peddling this line. The ordinary people of this country voted in a Tory government with an 80 seat majority after 10 years of Tory austerity.   If rich Tory MPs are out of touch what's your excuse?
1309430084076531712 2020-09-25 17:50:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Oh no😢  https://t.co/AwYKgMy7I0

1309422764235853826 2020-09-25 17:21:29 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Keith02 @packetsniffer99 Hmmm ... you talk about old people as if they are a separate species forgetting perhaps that you are talking about your mother, father, grandparents etc. If fate treats us well we are all going to be old one day including you.
1309422001237504000 2020-09-25 17:18:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @XkeepsmilinX I'll give that a proper read, thanks.
1309420207945977856 2020-09-25 17:11:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GalileoIndex Sad but true in a lot of cases.
1309213242586288128 2020-09-25 03:28:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Sixty6MK @AndrewP92494752 I hear this argument all the time and it doesn't make sense to me. So if we pretend Covid isn't a problem and just go about our business how long do you think it would be before the NHS was only able to cope with Covid patients? And not even cope with them?
1309212352693374979 2020-09-25 03:25:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @BrexiteerHead I didn't avoid it I just don't look at things in that way. If a death can be avoided it doesn't matter what age they are, it's always a good thing.
1309183387924598785 2020-09-25 01:30:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Quirky_Poppins Nor mine thankfully.
1309183112300105730 2020-09-25 01:29:12 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @BrexiteerHead It’s not about kidney transplants and it’s not like there is such a stark choice. If we are all considerate then the spread is slowed and less people are hospitalised and die.
1309174179032334339 2020-09-25 00:53:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @CommonM82230275 A pretty comprehensive list!
1309172868517945344 2020-09-25 00:48:29 +0800 <JustineClaire65> If you throw stones you shouldn’t live in a glass house.
1309171474058694658 2020-09-25 00:42:57 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @bear44willis No it doesn’t, not in this country anyway.
1309171277387755522 2020-09-25 00:42:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I’m not sick and I didn’t mention children for that very reason.   You may not value your life that’s your choice. I value all lives.
1309168549399801856 2020-09-25 00:31:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @CommonM82230275 I know, it doesn’t reflect what’s in my head🤭
1309167481207033858 2020-09-25 00:27:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jay12f I'm not ignorant. I can construct sentences and spell. Have a nice day😁

1309161266989142022 2020-09-25 00:02:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jay12f Yeah, like I say it's a blessed relief you don't get to decide.
1309160800595128321 2020-09-25 00:00:32 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ejectamenta_com Actually if I had a cold I may not visit elderly relatives before Covid. It's called having consideration for other people. New concept to some.
1309160366291783682 2020-09-24 23:58:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ronnocm2 I was outlining someone else's proposed solution.
1309160106211278853 2020-09-24 23:57:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ImScaryBullFrog @LadyMercia The French love the EU when they benefit, not so much when they don't😉
1309159820461776903 2020-09-24 23:56:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @jay12f No the future is for everyone with a future, ie everyone.  Thank God you don't get to decide what happens.
1309158334667411459 2020-09-24 23:50:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnEng1ish 'World government' when Johnson wants to leave the EU🙄
1309157998166712322 2020-09-24 23:49:24 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Steveofhope @MarnieRiptide @packetsniffer99 There are different versions of flu each year and the vaccine doesn't give you immunity against them all.
1309157735955656706 2020-09-24 23:48:21 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @packetsniffer99 Maybe.
1309155702296977416 2020-09-24 23:40:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @packetsniffer99 Completely irresponsible.
1309154361185107968 2020-09-24 23:34:57 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @packetsniffer99 Oh like with chicken pox what a great idea🙄
1309154146898108423 2020-09-24 23:34:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @packetsniffer99 Oh so it will just fizzle out.
1309153990081482757 2020-09-24 23:33:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @packetsniffer99 @MarnieRiptide Treatments. Please, this is not the common cold🤨
1309153436450074631 2020-09-24 23:31:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @packetsniffer99 Why a couple of months? Because you're relying on herd immunity?
1309153193994137602 2020-09-24 23:30:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @packetsniffer99 As are you😁
1309152404542291975 2020-09-24 23:27:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Spot on!
1309151722649116677 2020-09-24 23:24:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @packetsniffer99 Short period?
1309151653245988866 2020-09-24 23:24:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @packetsniffer99 Although there is a strong likelihood that natural immunity is short lived.
1309151358919024645 2020-09-24 23:23:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> The "I'm a victim, look at me" generation🙄
1309150835310497795 2020-09-24 23:20:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @BOBERTCOL Nobody does, but neither do I want people locked away indefinitely.
1309149619276972032 2020-09-24 23:16:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Supporting the government still I see🙄
1309139564657881089 2020-09-24 22:36:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Oh dear  https://t.co/szwsRmdd8p
1309134889875394561 2020-09-24 22:17:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @packetsniffer99 So that would be a lockdown for the at risk groups, and their households until a vaccine was found. Including financial support so that they could pay their bills and hold open their jobs for the duration?
1309133217547591680 2020-09-24 22:10:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @packetsniffer99 Both.
1309132221228425216 2020-09-24 22:06:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @packetsniffer99 Ok so what would you have the government do differently?
1309132053573758979 2020-09-24 22:06:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JoHamLew @packetsniffer99 @ProfKarolSikora @MichaelYeadon3 I didn't reply global conspiracy to you. If you check my last response to you.
1309131306010378240 2020-09-24 22:03:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WoodmanGS We have two choices as I see it. We either leave people to get on with it, advising people to take care or we impose some restrictions and enforce. The former will mean there will be a lot of hospitalisations and deaths and the latter means that the economy takes a big hit.
1309129407211151365 2020-09-24 21:55:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @daveguitarclark I didn't say I was a conservative? I'm not scared for myself either, and I'm not in an at risk group, but that doesn't mean I don't have family and friends who are. I am scared of infecting them because they could die.
1309128410153857026 2020-09-24 21:51:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @IVOTEDLEAVE3 @JoHamLew @packetsniffer99 No it's a global conspiracy🙄
1309128239252635658 2020-09-24 21:51:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JoHamLew @packetsniffer99 @ProfKarolSikora @MichaelYeadon3 Yes thank you I read around and for everyone you come up with there are others, many more others, who do not follow their line of thought. You see, they don't all agree, but other than Sweden they all locked down.
1309127716671717379 2020-09-24 21:49:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WoodmanGS Well that's honest. I wouldn't be happy to do that because I have friends and family who would likely be isolated.
1309126649619845120 2020-09-24 21:44:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JoHamLew @packetsniffer99 It is a pandemic and almost every western country has locked down and still have restrictions. You need to look at the facts.
1309126270001741826 2020-09-24 21:43:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WoodmanGS Oh ok so effectively lockdown those people until a vaccine becomes available. I guess we would give the families an option of having their vulnerable family member locked in a home so that they could continue working to pay the bills? Or would we pay them to stay isolated?
1309125385561440258 2020-09-24 21:39:48 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JoHamLew @packetsniffer99 This is a pandemic and it kills people with underlying conditions, mainly old people. It leaves some people with long term problems. It is very infectious.
1309124474122493959 2020-09-24 21:36:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @airstripone84 @daveguitarclark 🤦🏻‍♀️
1309124143602860035 2020-09-24 21:34:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @freeeedom90 I think it is very potent for vulnerable groups. Most other countries think so too.
1309123182843105286 2020-09-24 21:31:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WoodmanGS But what does that 'protect the at risks groups' look like? Remember not all old people live in care homes &amp; not all at risk people are old, they can be children with other conditions. They live with people who are not at risk. It's easy to say what you say but not so easy to do.
1309122317801455616 2020-09-24 21:27:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @BOBERTCOL So not interact with other people then? For years, potentially.
1309122170409365506 2020-09-24 21:27:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @packetsniffer99 Would Covid be more of a problem if it killed predominantly 20-30 year olds? How would you expect the government to act differently? Or would you expect the same approach?
1309120875279548418 2020-09-24 21:21:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @daveguitarclark When you say concentrate on the vulnerable what do you mean? In precise terms because I believe that by slowing the spread of the infection we are all concentrating on helping the vulnerable. The vulnerable don't live in isolation, they live and interact with family &amp; friends.
1309106493699096580 2020-09-24 20:24:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @daveguitarclark So what would you do that the government hasn't?
1309105928315252737 2020-09-24 20:22:29 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Helen29260350 And young people with conditions that make them vulnerable? We are going to all die that's the only certainty but surely we all have a responsibility to not put people at risk.
1309103154349461504 2020-09-24 20:11:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @daveguitarclark Old people don't all have 6 months to live. A 70 yr old could have 25-30 years still to live.  Quarantine people with underlying conditions. They are not sick they are vulnerable. So take them away from their families, the old &amp; the young? Because there are children in this group
1309044412828262400 2020-09-24 16:18:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnPKent2 Please provide the source of your assertions. The recovery rate for young people is higher and the older &amp; vulnerable categories much lower.  So if most deaths occurred for the age range 20-30 you would have the same outlook?
1309041438496260097 2020-09-24 16:06:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @bumble200 I get the sentiment but if we do things on cold economics we would be better off without all older people who rely on state benefits, disabled &amp; poor people who rely on benefits etc. Where does that end? I suggest a decent society is judged by how it treats the vulnerable.
1309034038661963776 2020-09-24 15:36:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> There seems to be this general, chilling imo view that Covid deaths are ok because it is mainly older people who die. So if most of the deaths were for people aged 20 - 30 that would be a proper pandemic would it? #AllLivesMattter
1309033093555253249 2020-09-24 15:33:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @seuymourkate So that's ok then? The fact they may have had another 10 years to live is irrelevant at that age is it? That could be your gran or mum btw.  Also younger people ie those over 45 can be hospitalised and have long term health issues. That ok too?
1308845558531067904 2020-09-24 03:07:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> ... and then you wake up ...
1308842679581773839 2020-09-24 02:56:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @normian100 @HelenBarbaraSmi Maybe it's been restricted😁
1308836637347020813 2020-09-24 02:32:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @StVitusDance @SallyPresto @johndmtb Yes, we have to wait until lots more people die and our hospitals are overwhelmed though. Just to be sure🙄
1308823797793988610 2020-09-24 01:41:24 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JaggersRay @RichardBurgon 😂
1308823704214867968 2020-09-24 01:41:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Mioewing @RichardBurgon I know!
1308823208011890689 2020-09-24 01:39:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @saxon_angelo Just my luck😉
1308822242663559170 2020-09-24 01:35:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JaggersRay @RichardBurgon Was a bit unkind of me😔 But what countries?😉
1308820282912780288 2020-09-24 01:27:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @RichardBurgon Which other countries?
1308819477727936512 2020-09-24 01:24:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @skankyliar @IVOTEDLEAVE3 😂 'brain dead'. 😂 Have a pleasant evening.
1308815599590674434 2020-09-24 01:08:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @skankyliar @IVOTEDLEAVE3 Yet the police have no right of entry to check whether there are more than 6 people inside your house🤨
1308815281112965128 2020-09-24 01:07:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Did she happen to mention which street😉
1308814919408680963 2020-09-24 01:06:08 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TheBembridge Match made in woke heaven them two.
1308814188022763520 2020-09-24 01:03:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @IVOTEDLEAVE3 @skankyliar Oh ok, so please let me have some examples of children being taken away from parents etc.
1308813375409856512 2020-09-24 00:59:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TimPendry @Crosscolin88 Me too.
1308812823779303424 2020-09-24 00:57:48 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @SallyPresto @johndmtb No, we are not in lockdown.
1308812118733582342 2020-09-24 00:55:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @skankyliar @IVOTEDLEAVE3 So you are against him making further restrictions so that people won't die but accuse him of killing people. Ok ... that makes sense.
1308808216994885634 2020-09-24 00:39:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc Never head in the sand with me Mark. I know exactly what I voted for, I wanted to leave years ago.  The EU is a declining empire and we have very sensibly been the first to realise it.  You are all about speculation, there are no facts yet because we haven't properly left.
1308807372266188801 2020-09-24 00:36:08 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @1Danger_Mouse @Exp_Sec_Prof No they call others selfish because they don't follow the guidance.
1308806949731999752 2020-09-24 00:34:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @BadgeSmiley 😂😂
1308806814071480320 2020-09-24 00:33:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @skankyliar @IVOTEDLEAVE3 I know it's complete madness supporting your elected prime minister. How could they?😉
1308806381907173386 2020-09-24 00:32:12 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc Agree with.  The two facts he never got was who won the referendum and who got an 80 seat majority on a 'get Brexit done' ticket.  He's a lightweight career moaner.
1308804894145601537 2020-09-24 00:26:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @BadgeSmiley Well they're not working.
1308804765971877889 2020-09-24 00:25:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @skankyliar @IVOTEDLEAVE3 I have no idea what you are on about.
1308804254484893697 2020-09-24 00:23:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> You are a miserable bugger🙄
1308800787594829824 2020-09-24 00:09:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc Please tell me you don't support Femi? I quite like a debate with you but that would be disappointing😢
1308799115753553920 2020-09-24 00:03:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @streaky81 There's protests every weekend what are you on about?  What country/planet are you on?
1308797567162109954 2020-09-23 23:57:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @campbellclaret But two female Tory PMs and remind me how may female labour PMs again?
1308795936244727809 2020-09-23 23:50:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> OMG - you really are not going to try to pitch yourself as being intellectually superior to Ann Widdecombe are you?  That is so funny😂😂😂
1308789012803526657 2020-09-23 23:23:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @christine_imo Me too😁
1308781430269411336 2020-09-23 22:53:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Fox_Claire @DanielG26598926 @KingOfWrong They sense that they are losing some of the majority who do the right thing. People seem to be behaving how they like without consequences. This is a knee jerk reaction to that but because it's not Johnson's default style I think it comes across as clumsy.
1308765872459329537 2020-09-23 21:51:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @streaky81 @Fox_Claire They haven't banned protests and the state really doesn't control journalism. So we are nowhere near your apocalyptic view of the country.
1308765081166110726 2020-09-23 21:48:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Nigel100007 Yes, and because of that I support them, although I don't get a vote😉
1308762109925363718 2020-09-23 21:36:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DanielG26598926 @Fox_Claire @KingOfWrong I think they want us to take personal responsibility and look out for each other. For most people that comes naturally. For a noisy minority, it doesn't.
1308761336558608392 2020-09-23 21:33:12 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @streaky81 @Fox_Claire Well I didn't vote for them at all. And it's ridiculous saying we are ruled with an iron fist. Far as I can see some people are not taking a blind bit of notice and the rest of us have to suffer because of it.
1308733272554377217 2020-09-23 19:41:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @zero_to_here_oh I'll take your word for that.
1308732782353489920 2020-09-23 19:39:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @zero_to_here_oh So you are not an expert then😂
1308732333542060032 2020-09-23 19:37:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @andrewc92164336 @CaptainPickle2 @mikebrewer1 @Fox_Claire Ensuring the NHS was not overwhelmed.  A lockdown that encouraged exercise.  Got testing capacity up to one of the highest levels in Europe.  Sorted the supply chain for PPE.  Job retention scheme.
1308730638720270336 2020-09-23 19:31:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Do you support the Prime Minister in terms of the new Covid restrictions outlined yesterday?
1308729504236478464 2020-09-23 19:26:43 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @CaptainPickle2 @mikebrewer1 @Fox_Claire Why does everyone think people who are supporting the government are terrified. I am not afraid or terrified I just think that this is what we have to do. My emotion is irritability at people who think they know better than the experts.
1308728103557005312 2020-09-23 19:21:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @zero_to_here_oh You declared that have you? Being an expert on the subject?
1308727770369974272 2020-09-23 19:19:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DanielG26598926 @Fox_Claire @KingOfWrong My argument is that we are not all afraid.
1308719420655759362 2020-09-23 18:46:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DanielG26598926 @Fox_Claire @KingOfWrong Oh for goodness sake where does this wanting to control people through fear stuff actually come from? I think he's just trying to get some people to 'get real' and act responsibly.
1308695045395144705 2020-09-23 17:09:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Fox_Claire NI, Wales and Scotland have introduced much more draconian measures than Johnson. Nobody seems to mention this 2/2
1308694427200876544 2020-09-23 17:07:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Fox_Claire But Witty in particular right from the beginning pointed out the other costs with going down the lockdown route. Mental health, other conditions not being picked up and treated. If we allow Covid to spread out of control then those same things will continue to cost us dearly 1/1
1308673008572272641 2020-09-23 15:42:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @mikebrewer1 @Fox_Claire It hasn't worked recently has it, for some people.
1308670166264426498 2020-09-23 15:30:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lbc Nick I haven't heard anybody commenting on the fact that Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have introduced much more draconian measures than the UK government in respect of Covid19. Please give us some perspective on this.
1308662383829757953 2020-09-23 15:00:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @mikebrewer1 @Fox_Claire I don't think doing nothing is an option really do you?
1308542171855888390 2020-09-23 07:02:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @mikebrewer1 @Fox_Claire Hospitalisation are rising and deaths will follow if we do nothing.
1308541797845565443 2020-09-23 07:00:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I know you’re not happy with Boris, but come on! He talks like an actor in a cheap soap opera.
1308539407864147968 2020-09-23 06:51:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Why haven’t I seen a single tweet about how much more draconian the Covid19 measures introduced in Wales, Scotland &amp; Northern Ireland are than those announced by Johnson.   Funny that🙄
1308536550121234439 2020-09-23 06:39:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Fox_Claire I do so often agree with you Claire but on this occasion I don’t. This is a pandemic &amp; people need to be reminded to act responsibly. Are you saying that he’s lying about the escalation in cases or do you just think that people should be left to get on with it? What would you do?
1308530748857757696 2020-09-23 06:16:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Another hysterical journalist. Do they follow a rota?
1308492725357096960 2020-09-23 03:45:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I see people worried about a global pandemic🤨
1308491893970554889 2020-09-23 03:42:32 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Brie0748 I hate wearing a mask too, I've developed this facial contortion under the mask so that my breath doesn't mist up my glasses😁. I do miss meeting up with bigger groups too.
1308488852546486273 2020-09-23 03:30:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Brie0748 I'm not suggesting that there won't be another lockdown but it didn't seem likely to me that would happen now and I'm no expert. Some people's 'go to' is hysteria!
1308485864314613760 2020-09-23 03:18:35 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So no second lockdown.   Looking forward to the flood of "I so overreacted yesterday" tweets from the hystericals.🤨
1308484375982624768 2020-09-23 03:12:40 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Or perhaps not.
1308463983247208450 2020-09-23 01:51:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @gerryoliver1 Thank you.
1308463797464707072 2020-09-23 01:50:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Brilliant! Well done Jo and Ali😁
1308462401675821056 2020-09-23 01:45:21 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @SteveTheRanger1 And mine.
1308462334847967234 2020-09-23 01:45:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ContraTrolls Has put me on a list entitled 'Racists' because he/she/it is incapable of debating.  He/she/it hasn't the guts to identify who they are.  😂😂😂
1308460522971574272 2020-09-23 01:37:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Open borders and kneeling for the far left #BLM who believe that everything that Britain has ever done is shameful.  Yeah, very patriotic🙄
1308423624416731137 2020-09-22 23:11:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> You may not want to pour your tea into the toaster as both will be destroyed. Bit like your brand when you meddled with politics.
1308404352164429824 2020-09-22 21:54:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @SteveTheRanger1 Thanks Steve.
1308404291825283074 2020-09-22 21:54:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @tonyedwardson Thank you.
1308176349207638017 2020-09-22 06:48:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @QuantimeFlux So very sorry. I have lost someone too😢
1308172597343944705 2020-09-22 06:33:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Nigel100007 Done.
1308172527001374720 2020-09-22 06:33:29 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Sadly, we don’t always know the depths of someone’s depression until it is too late. 😥 May I please have even 1 friend or family member to copy and re-post? I am trying to demonstrate that someone is always listening. #SuicideAwareness  Just one. Any one. Say DONE
1308171875378397184 2020-09-22 06:30:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> My final thought of the day:   “A little knowledge is a dangerous thing”.  Night
1308126548650790912 2020-09-22 03:30:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> At work and school there are measures in place. At home we don't have any measures. I think that's what he's trying to say.
1308125909287923712 2020-09-22 03:28:15 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @edna_humbug They also say we should wear masks in public places where we cannot socially distance I believe.
1308122192165695488 2020-09-22 03:13:29 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @edna_humbug Not me😁
1308122086917971970 2020-09-22 03:13:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @chrishunt77 Most people use the same grade mask as those worn in care homes.
1308121720457498625 2020-09-22 03:11:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Was that an apology Robert?  Thought not.
1308120845152378880 2020-09-22 03:08:07 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @edna_humbug What if they become symptomatic whilst at work, in a care home specifically.
1308120072226066433 2020-09-22 03:05:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @rjheathfield 😂 Too true.
1308119326621413377 2020-09-22 03:02:05 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DisgruntledPat1 I was specifically asking about staff in care homes.
1308118130233835521 2020-09-22 02:57:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Or perhaps he wanted the scientists to be detached from the politics.  That may be helpful to people for context.
1308117489990107136 2020-09-22 02:54:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DisgruntledPat1 At least you are consistent.
1308116856650203140 2020-09-22 02:52:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @tractorboynz 5
1308116527225470976 2020-09-22 02:50:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Do you think staff in care homes should stop wearing masks?
1308115950466719747 2020-09-22 02:48:40 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @allisonpearson That was worst case up to mid October in terms of cases doubling every week. Clearly, if this continues after mid October the 200 deaths a day isn't the worst case.   Nobody forces anyone to smoke. The comparison isn't a good one.
1308104133040377858 2020-09-22 02:01:43 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I think it may have been something you said😉

1308038622248136705 2020-09-21 21:41:24 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Cheeseo76847269 My friend went to Mary Hare School. She is profoundly deaf. I met her at Uni where we studied together. She married someone she met there and most of her best friends are those she met there. She is in her 50s now and it was probably the best thing for her. Hard for parents tho'.
1308036922535800839 2020-09-21 21:34:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Clearly Labour were the party of incompetence up to this point then😉
1308004341006192641 2020-09-21 19:25:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> We already knew they were not going to take questions.
1307995523979378689 2020-09-21 18:50:08 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Everyone knows from the Grinch that Christmas will happen anyway.
1307994969978875904 2020-09-21 18:47:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> That's because they give us the science &amp; tomorrow we'll get the decision on what we need to do. Personally I will be surprised if we have a second lockdown at this point because of all the other side effects. I think they will introduce new measures to protect the vulnerable.😢
1307991945931886593 2020-09-21 18:35:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I'm not so sure.

1307742889007554560 2020-09-21 02:06:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Why are we talking about a second lockdown as if it has definitely been decided.  Did I miss the announcement?
1307741803500711937 2020-09-21 02:01:57 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Rolo_Tamasi They haven't literally said we are having a second lockdown but it's put across as if Matt Hancock wants one and everyone is trying to talk him down from the ledge. Whereas when he's interviewed he says nothing like that.
1307736705240309762 2020-09-21 01:41:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GalileoIndex Me too. Just everyone getting angry that the government is even considering it. They have to consider everything, doesn't mean they are going to use it.
1307734492862439425 2020-09-21 01:32:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> How have we gone from the "nuclear" option of a second lockdown ie very unlikely, to 'we are definitely having a second lockdown'?  Is that just Twitterland &amp; MSM scaremongering?

1307328162649571329 2020-09-19 22:38:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @waterloo5000 @tonyedwardson @MalScrimgeour Most countries had a lot of hospital admissions, took measures to stop the spread &amp; then the hospitalisations &amp; deaths came down. Hmmm.. yes that would explain the shape of the curve being similar. Hey &amp; guess what when people go back to some normality it starts all over again🤨
1307326426211909632 2020-09-19 22:31:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GSeligit So 0.2% of people who catch Covid die? And what % of our population of 67m have had Covid. Just so I can do the maths. As 41k have died so far.
1307323904357212160 2020-09-19 22:21:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GSeligit No you cannot suggest a big conspiracy theory without having some idea of what the motivation behind that might be. That's just random.
1307323900905259008 2020-09-19 22:21:21 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @packetsniffer99 @tonyedwardson @MalScrimgeour No, lockdown was an emergency measure and clearly has long term implications that we have no idea of. Sweden didn't do nothing. Just Swedish people tended to follow the guidance that was asked of them as they trust their experts more than we do.
1307320460758134784 2020-09-19 22:07:41 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GSeligit Yes, so lets see what happens there as infections are doubling every week at the moment.
1307320220957188097 2020-09-19 22:06:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @packetsniffer99 @tonyedwardson @MalScrimgeour Yes, that's what Ivor puts it down to. However, that's not proven as the virus hasn't gone away. Around the corner comes the flu season and Covid.
1307318620406546434 2020-09-19 22:00:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @tonyedwardson @MalScrimgeour Sweden needs to be compared to similar countries like Denmark &amp; Norway. Deaths in Sweden are much higher than those COMPARABLE countries.
1307318258404667401 2020-09-19 21:58:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GSeligit Who specifically is doing this? And why?  If I'm a gullible sheep to you, you are sounding like a tin foil hat wearer to me.
1307316739722674178 2020-09-19 21:52:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GSeligit I wouldn't be rushing at taking a vaccine that I didn't feel comfortable with no.
1307316459543179264 2020-09-19 21:51:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GSeligit It's not over yet and we haven't had to deal with Covid plus the flu because the flu season was over by the time Covid took hold last winter.
1307315696372678662 2020-09-19 21:48:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @waterloo5000 That's rubbish. Nothing was clear. My friend works in ICU (for over 30 years) in a big hospital in Manchester and the Covid patients spilled into all their general wards that they had turned into Covid wards. She had never seen anything like it.
1307314842844495872 2020-09-19 21:45:21 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @MalScrimgeour The lockdown stopped it getting worse, the same as here.

1307292855912849413 2020-09-19 20:17:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GSeligit If you were saying this of XR &amp; BLM I would agree with you. I don't agree with you in relation to Covid. This is a public health issue and although our freedoms are temporarily restricted I believe it is an emergency and necessary. We won't agree on this but always nice engaging.
1307290312071622661 2020-09-19 20:07:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
1307283827467980800 2020-09-19 19:42:07 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @MalScrimgeour They weren't because we had a lockdown which prevented the spread and hence the cases that ended up in hospital. It was about flattening the curve. We saw the health system being overwhelmed in Italy and Spain.
1307273766368612357 2020-09-19 19:02:08 +0800 <JustineClaire65> That was in 2006 fgs.
1307270874760982529 2020-09-19 18:50:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @MalScrimgeour I'm not quite sure what you mean, the beginning. Clearly if there's only a few cases then this will not overwhelm. There was a test and trace in place at the beginning but as soon as the infections escalated the system couldn't cope.
1307269546936545281 2020-09-19 18:45:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @juliesmith472 But that was never going to happen. The world doesn't work as one does it? NZ got the closest to eradicating it but as I say it only works if you keep your borders closed, no in, no out for months/years. We have to live with it but keep it under control.
1307252022819856384 2020-09-19 17:35:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @juliesmith472 Nowhere has eradicated it completely and unless we lock our borders to everyone in the world we never could.
1307247616430878720 2020-09-19 17:18:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> It's all about Brexit.
1307246256247496704 2020-09-19 17:12:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I never believed a lockdown would stop the virus. Who said that? It just slows down the spread so that we can use test and trace and not overwhelm the NHS.

They’d have to be bloody geniuses to know all the answers. They represent us. We elect them to be our voice. Not to vote for things we don’t agree with. We got a ref because it was a big decision.

I have questions around Covid19 we all do but this is one scientist’s theory, not all scientists. Some of what he says seems very plausible. However, there is a weight of scientific opinion that differs from it.

But you are unlikely to contract it straight after your test because I assume you have been doing all the social distancing etc, you don't catch covid simply by breathing. How hard is that to understand?

If you have symptoms and you test negative then you don't have Covid and if you feel ok you go back to school/work. If you are positive then you have to self-isolate for 10 days.
1306684205586411521 2020-09-18 03:59:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @char_slim @juckky72 People generally apply for the test when they have symptoms. Symptoms generally don't develop that quickly with Covid19, that makes it different from some of the others.

1306674221150593025 2020-09-18 03:19:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> You're not really all ears are you because you have #covidLies in your name.   If you test negative then you can catch it immediately if you don't social distance, wash your hands etc. But if you have done those things then it's unlikely you have contracted it.

We are in a constant battle to fight 'nature'. Look at poor countries, that's nature in action. Low life expectancy.

1306512038462709760 2020-09-17 16:35:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @mb8son Covid is highly infectious and lots of people are not very poorly so are out and about spreading it to people who will die from it. Flu makes you very poorly so people self isolate naturally. We do care about flu hence why vulnerable people get free flu jabs?

1306503971784331264 2020-09-17 16:03:15 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @ManselW So accept thousands will die? Because that may actually be the only way but let's be honest and say that. Not make it sound like there's a simple answer to this.

1306502289864232960 2020-09-17 15:56:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @mb8son But what does that mean given the virus is still here. Because if we say go back to normal we are accepting a lot of people are going to die unless we are saying that older &amp; vulnerable people need to isolate and the rest of us just get on with it?

1306494966730981376 2020-09-17 15:27:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So Charlie Stayt just asked a great question of one of the teacher union representative. You keep saying that there are lots of teachers having to self isolate at home with symptoms who can't get a test. How many are there in this position?  He had no idea🙄

1306490563483574275 2020-09-17 15:09:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TonyHumphreys2 Yes, but that is a separate point from neutral journalism.
1306342140130320384 2020-09-17 05:20:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AntWadebridge No it's obviously a dig at Johnson who Peston believes is behaving like Trump.

The benefits system is a safety net not a cure all. The best way out of poverty for children is through education. We should focus on making that better, much better.
1306190309781647360 2020-09-16 19:16:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @UVuuMe @oaedoel @Crosscolin88 @BBC It is true though that people make decisions on how they spend their money. Some people make better decisions than others. Some need food banks often just for a bit because they have lost jobs and haven't received benefits yet. There is a genuine need I am sure. For some people.

I was not making a value judgement. It isn’t absolute poverty that’s just a fact. So you can go and signal your virtue at someone who has not come from poverty. Believe me I know what poverty is.

The median is such an income that exactly a half of households earn more than that and the other half earns less.

1305914667655626752 2020-09-16 01:01:34 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @northumbrian_ Oh don't come that Mark. You, like the MSM, question everything our side say whilst believing everything the EU say at face value. You are just being disingenuous with your 'hmmm'.
1305913931391799298 2020-09-16 00:58:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @noone153952770 There's no need for spin. This is being put into place because the EU have threatened us. If they hadn't threatened we wouldn't need to.  The same argument was made for the backstop by the EU I seem to remember. We are not likely to need it but 'just in case'😉
1305880185397481474 2020-09-15 22:44:32 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I think he self identifies as black.  It's allowed now apparently😉
1305872238416142339 2020-09-15 22:12:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @northumbrian_ According to Boris Johnson it came up during the last set of talks.

1305861679297724421 2020-09-15 21:31:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @marshpw0102 I stand corrected. English &amp; Welsh people.

1305852399375048706 2020-09-15 20:54:08 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @noone153952770 Mark, there was a 77 majority on the vote. That's fairly decisive isn't it.
1305852074589118464 2020-09-15 20:52:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @northumbrian_ @turkishmerc I think it will focus everyone's mind on getting an FTA. I don't think we should ignore the threat. So long as the EU don't see it through then we'll never implement it. So why the fuss? The Treaty is only broken if we implement certain parts of the Bill.
1305848238516383745 2020-09-15 20:37:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc @noone153952770 It only breaks the Treaty if he implements it. Having it on the statute book doesn't break anything at all. So you think a foreign body should dictate the terms on which we move goods in our own country?
1305847494740512770 2020-09-15 20:34:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @turkishmerc Or Boris rather optimistically believed that the EU would negotiate in good faith &amp; give us an FTA rather like Canada. Now the EU are clearly determined to make us pay for having the audacity to leave he is looking after our interests, as he should. He has not broken any law. Yet
1305843979758559238 2020-09-15 20:20:40 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @IceStella77 It's all a big unknown at the moment isn't it. The UK has left and trades on WTO. Beyond that is anyone's guess.

1305781377053454337 2020-09-15 16:11:55 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Well that will not be interfering with our parliamentary democracy then🤨
1305774410465513472 2020-09-15 15:44:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> He's a remainer after all. What a shock.
1305773757773025285 2020-09-15 15:41:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> The British people voted the Tories in precisely to get Brexit done and look after Britain's interests. Have you learned nothing?

1305609586557292544 2020-09-15 04:49:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AnnaV007 Lovely chatting with you Anna😁
1305609433175777281 2020-09-15 04:48:40 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AnnaV007 Yes, it's a tough call isn't it. I think we are getting on with the economy and kids being back at school is important too. I personally don't find the rule of 6 and wearing masks in shops a biggy if it helps. The question is, does it help?
1305603244039770116 2020-09-15 04:24:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AnnaV007 Yes, they did &amp; do sometimes still test asymptomatic people. You may well have a good point here, especially if we continue to not see a corresponding increase in hospital admissions &amp; ICU cases. Thing is I think we ought to err on the side of caution in case you are wrong.
1305600420052688896 2020-09-15 04:12:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AnnaV007 Thanks that’s very detailed. But what I don’t understand is that for people to have a test, they first present with symptoms. So are you saying that these people have symptoms which could be say just a cold but test positive for Covid19 because they had Covid19 previously?
1305599022372188160 2020-09-15 04:07:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WitchEnd That was very interesting but I’m not convinced. XS deaths should be looked at over more than just 2 years. And I was a bit confused by the testing explanation because those tested present with symptoms. So having old traces picked up is only an explanation if we mass test.
1305587421522866183 2020-09-15 03:21:12 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AnnaV007 What does it mean?
1305570940563185664 2020-09-15 02:15:43 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DavidSm17715434 I think that may have been it 😁
1305560009074409473 2020-09-15 01:32:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WitchEnd I haven’t but I will. Didn’t notice the video link.
1305559421607710720 2020-09-15 01:29:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DisgruntledPat1 Where has that approach worked well before?
1305558084685881348 2020-09-15 01:24:38 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @WitchEnd That’s not how it works. Once the virus is out of your system you don’t test positive. You may test positive to an anti body test but not the swab test. People generally only have tests if they have symptoms.
1305553760190705672 2020-09-15 01:07:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DisgruntledPat1 Oh ok. So leave it to people to take personal responsibility. And excessive deaths would be blamed on people who could not take responsibility and not the government. Could work.
1305551241653649408 2020-09-15 00:57:26 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DisgruntledPat1 So bit like what the government is advising?
1305550920969850880 2020-09-15 00:56:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @tonyedwardson @Much_Love77 @goodridgeAFC87 @CotswoldsWorcs So that implies that with over 41000 deaths in the UK 41m people have had Covid (0.1% death rate). Which means over 60% of the population have had it.
1305546496021012480 2020-09-15 00:38:35 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Thomas54807575 @Ann06957684 But no more😂
1305546249718857736 2020-09-15 00:37:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> And your reaction to the increase in positive test results David would be ...?   Just everyone's quick to criticise and not so quick to say what they'd do.
1305545274346086402 2020-09-15 00:33:43 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @tonyedwardson @Much_Love77 @goodridgeAFC87 @CotswoldsWorcs I understand your argument but you do remember when Johnson was accused of locking down late. I think we are in one of those situations. I guess they don't want to risk this one running away from them.
1305544530586894337 2020-09-15 00:30:46 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Much_Love77 @tonyedwardson @goodridgeAFC87 @CotswoldsWorcs I don't think we know that do we as we would need to know how many people have had it. It is estimated that around 1% die from Covid. Mostly old people and those with underlying medical conditions.
1305541693144526851 2020-09-15 00:19:30 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @tonyedwardson @goodridgeAFC87 @Much_Love77 @CotswoldsWorcs Whereas at the beginning we feared there were a lot of false negatives.
1305541301732020224 2020-09-15 00:17:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Much_Love77 @tonyedwardson @goodridgeAFC87 @CotswoldsWorcs But the positive results have literally only just started to increase &amp; we do know there is a lag between high infections &amp; hospital admissions. Unless you think that this time people will not be hospitalised for some reason? France is seeing an increase in hospital admissions.
1305540543603257345 2020-09-15 00:14:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @tonyedwardson @Much_Love77 @goodridgeAFC87 @CotswoldsWorcs I stand corrected.
1305540401412165632 2020-09-15 00:14:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @TomClarke24G We are staying in a Scandinavian style wooden cabin. Big windows and lovely views, if only it would ever stop raining😁 The Island is very beautiful, empty of people &amp; reminds me a little bit of Anglesey which is a place I also love. But more remote and rugged.
1305538766090760192 2020-09-15 00:07:52 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Much_Love77 @tonyedwardson @goodridgeAFC87 @CotswoldsWorcs 13/9 - 3300 cases, it's on the increase. This is the highest number since May.
1305534368082014209 2020-09-14 23:50:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @tonyedwardson @goodridgeAFC87 @Much_Love77 @CotswoldsWorcs You are right but new cases have been low until recently. If we let cases increase then we won't be able to track &amp; trace as it only works when there are lowish numbers of cases. Hospital admissions will inevitably increase. Unless you think Covid no longer kills people?

1305069589957693440 2020-09-13 17:03:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @sergio75035352 Our government needs to look after our country. If the EU want to pull a fast one then we have to prepare for that. No one has broken international law yet.

1305061218508517377 2020-09-13 16:30:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Truth is the EU were never going to allow us a FTA like the Canada + deal. They expected the UK to back down and we haven't. They've threatened to effectively annex Britain from NI so of course the govt are not going to allow that to happen. Hence the bill. #marr
1305059314504216576 2020-09-13 16:22:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Well done #marr for putting the government's argument forward on third country status. Coveney getting his EU knickers in a proper twist.

1304854044100493313 2020-09-13 02:47:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @bestbaldmanever @Carol01115190 He thinks not and whatever was agreed was agreed on the basis that we would have an FTA with the EU. Looks like the EU is not acting in good faith on that and we have the right to pass our own laws.  See you in court may be the cry from Johnson.
1304852527314276352 2020-09-13 02:41:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @bestbaldmanever @Carol01115190 That's not true. Johnson always said there would be no extra checks between Britain and NI. NI and the rest of the UK are out of the customs union.

Let's be honest @UKLabour have been a bitter disappointment for many years haven't they.
1304690162597867520 2020-09-12 15:55:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @RupertGeorge @Keir_Starmer @theresa_may Yes, wrong term. Theresa May was elected as an MP but she is a failed and discredited PM.  Starmer was elected as an MP, not as leader because @UKLabour was an absolute shambles.  The majority voted to get Brexit done. 80 seat majority on that ticket.

I have no problem with people saying what they like about anyone really but it's backstabbing when it's one of your own team. We probably just need to agree to differ on this one.

1304094120512638977 2020-09-11 00:27:21 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnPKent2 No it doesn't. They are a team and Steve Baker is not a team player obviously. You make it sound like a righteous thing he has done. He's just slagged off a colleague on Twitter and he doesn't even let people comment. I didn't vote Tory btw.
1304093444189683713 2020-09-11 00:24:40 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnPKent2 @HelenBarbaraSmi What's democratic about Steve Baker slagging off Matt Hancock on Twitter?
1304093179755589632 2020-09-11 00:23:37 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @radders50 @ianbaker78 Such an old tweet but since then the British people voted in a Tory government on a 'get Brexit done' ticket after 10 years of Tory austerity with an 80 seat majority. I think the 52% has not changed its mind, don't you?  But then you're a 3.5% so don't believe in democracy😉
1304090265880272897 2020-09-11 00:12:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnPKent2 @HelenBarbaraSmi It doesn't make you a fan of Matt Hancock to criticise what Steve Baker has done here.
1304090045410947072 2020-09-11 00:11:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @JohnPKent2 There's ways and means. Twitter is neither. They are on the same team and that's not how team mates behave. Totally unprofessional, whatever you think of Matt Hancock.
1304089477191733249 2020-09-11 00:08:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @don_mickael @JuliadeCadenet No, funnily enough the leavers still want to leave.🙄  You have obviously been polishing your crystal ball again because until next year we cannot possibly know whether we will be better off outside the EU, or not.
1303793489780633601 2020-09-10 04:32:45 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So what do you suggest?

1303783440920317971 2020-09-10 03:52:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> That needs to happen or no one is going to take this rule seriously.  IMO the BLM protests was the point that a lot of people switched off with 'following the rules'.  #ScumMedia, celebrity luvvies and politicians did nothing to stop these demonstrations. And actively supported.
1303781355516551183 2020-09-10 03:44:32 +0800 <JustineClaire65> "Honouring promises"... Like marriage vows you mean Mr Major?  And Blair taking us into an illegal war.  Pair of hypocrites make a lovely couple.
1303779743440007168 2020-09-10 03:38:08 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @r1chuk He can do that in parliament, or even in private as he's a colleague. He doesn't need to tweet about it. It is totally unprofessional.
1303778535581118470 2020-09-10 03:33:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @r1chuk That's ok for you to do that, no problem. But that is his own party and own government. It's not appropriate for him to do that IMO.
1303778095191728129 2020-09-10 03:31:35 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @1ittlesanctuary Blocked you for asking a question? Sounds like a guilty conscience to me.
1303774377926950924 2020-09-10 03:16:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Have you resigned, or changed parties?   Why do you have to tweet against your own government?

Their economy has not been functioning at normal rates. People have been staying at home. They have experienced many more deaths than comparable countries.

It will be interesting to see which western country goes down that route first. Given our press &amp; opposition have blamed the govt for acting too slowly on everything so far and being responsible for thousands of deaths I'd put money on it not being ours.

1302675059232911360 2020-09-07 02:28:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @cookieclose @EdmundB30671419 @DoPradista @LozzaFox @BBC Oh ok. Sure.
1302674433342046210 2020-09-07 02:26:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> At last.  BBC News - CCTV issued in hunt for Birmingham attack suspect  https://t.co/KWL4mEcMDV
1302671739214757890 2020-09-07 02:15:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @komradred @RealDeniseWelch @MattHancock @BorisJohnson There's unlikely to be herd immunity. Cases are going up amongst young people who don't get hospitalised. We don't understand why there is no increase in hospital admissions &amp; deaths. It is likely that the most vulnerable are being very careful but the virus could have changed.
1302670120603574280 2020-09-07 02:08:53 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I don't understand why there is still no description of the perpetrator given he hasn't been caught yet. There's eye witness accounts and CCTV.
1302669094962040833 2020-09-07 02:04:49 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @komradred @RealDeniseWelch @MattHancock @BorisJohnson You may be right, clearly it wasn't a typical flu year during the height of the deaths but it may well be something that has passed in its severity now. Thing is, we don't know. And no leader in their right mind is going to call it all off.
1302666820613296128 2020-09-07 01:55:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @komradred @RealDeniseWelch @MattHancock @BorisJohnson I respect your view but the virus is out there and the elderly are the ones who die from it. The way he expresses himself may come across as patronising but the message is still correct.
1302653592659165186 2020-09-07 01:03:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @RealDeniseWelch @MattHancock @BorisJohnson You need some new friends. Most young people I know are happy and loved.
1302651618194862080 2020-09-07 00:55:22 +0800 <JustineClaire65> In order for me to take XR seriously I need to know that every single one of you protestors:  1. Never drives a car or accepts a lift. 2. Never uses a plane. 3. Has a vegan diet.  Then you have my ear and probably my respect.  I look forward to the day but not holding my breath.

1302643711206215683 2020-09-07 00:23:57 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @MAnneAmbrose1 That's like a trans Olive Oil.
1302643058916421632 2020-09-07 00:21:21 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Majeh19 It will split the labour vote not the Tory vote. So win win for the Tories.

1302635473601466369 2020-09-06 23:51:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @0_politics2 It's not 'where they can'. It's just their responsibility.
1302634761115054080 2020-09-06 23:48:23 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @cookieclose @EdmundB30671419 @DoPradista @LozzaFox @BBC I'm not a Tory, never voted Tory. And when I go into a ballot box I just silently put a cross in a box. I tend to not get invited to QT or contacted for my opinion at any time.
1302632864593383425 2020-09-06 23:40:51 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @cookieclose @EdmundB30671419 @DoPradista @LozzaFox @BBC We generally use the ballot box.

1302623524729892865 2020-09-06 23:03:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Luke_who_ A pair of plimsolls.
1302623140909125632 2020-09-06 23:02:13 +0800 <JustineClaire65> The Council of Europe isn't the EU. We've been a member of that for longer and will remain a member of that after full Brexit I believe.
1302621730893168642 2020-09-06 22:56:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @PaulAdamsNo1 I respect your view but I don't agree with it. Most western govts have imposed some form of lockdown. If it was just us I'd probably be out there protesting. It is absolutely not the instinct of a Tory govt to take away our liberties. And I'm not a Tory.
1302620334714167297 2020-09-06 22:51:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @gerryoliver1 😂 Yes but we could have 23 unhappy hours. We need to remain positive.
1302606044540162048 2020-09-06 21:54:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @PaulEmbery 😂
1302605741342306304 2020-09-06 21:53:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @PaulAdamsNo1 Yes, everything including our history books. However, we don't want to shut down certain outlets because they express a view we don't like. We can read around and form our own views. This is just another form of censorship that is happening it just restricts are view on the world
1302603410433286144 2020-09-06 21:43:48 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GSeligit 😂
1302602912296730625 2020-09-06 21:41:50 +0800 <JustineClaire65> And we all know that unhappiness is a protected characteristic in the UK.
1302601193169055747 2020-09-06 21:35:00 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I don't agree with the government assuming this is true but I think if you support XR you must be on their side with your recent tactics. So shouldn't you be congratulating the government for shutting down the #FreePress #Hypocrisy
1302600133616570370 2020-09-06 21:30:47 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I can see why they cried🤦🏻‍♀️
1302594754631340033 2020-09-06 21:09:25 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lbc So Maajid, working from home most days of the week means that a lot of people with jobs in London don't have to live in London. Eases the demand on housing in a ridiculously overcrowded city. Most of the rest of the country is not full!
1302588219738009600 2020-09-06 20:43:27 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Crosscolin88 I wanted to cry when he said that🙄

1302558026138779649 2020-09-06 18:43:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Mr_W_Carpenter It is suggested that it is not gang related and that they are looking for a single perpetrator.
1302549168519553025 2020-09-06 18:08:16 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Helen29260350 Too true, I try to read around what other countries are doing.
1302535591838519296 2020-09-06 17:14:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Helen29260350 It is not the care homes all over again though is it. The old in care homes were static &amp; were not properly protected, sitting ducks. In the demographic that die from this virus. The young are travelling &amp; generally mixing with each other at Uni. They generally don't die from it.
1302533535471894529 2020-09-06 17:06:09 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @stevesnell59uk @sammwhiting I know🙄
1302532248751702017 2020-09-06 17:01:02 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Love to.
1302531584986357760 2020-09-06 16:58:24 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @sammwhiting Thank you😁
1302530540411723778 2020-09-06 16:54:15 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @sammwhiting I think you are confused. #marr is an on the record lefty. Take your goggles off.
1302529647683534849 2020-09-06 16:50:42 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I don't agree with anyone restricting the freedom of the press.#marr
1302528269992984577 2020-09-06 16:45:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Lakesman5 #marr He has had days to think about that soundbite and determine that it was just hysterical fear mongering and instead he chooses to regurgitate it. Quite shamefully shallow journalism. 🤦🏻‍♀️
1302526999563513856 2020-09-06 16:40:11 +0800 <JustineClaire65> How could #marr quote that ridiculous comment about kids going back to Uni being the next care homes scandal. 🤦🏻‍♀️
1302526618393600001 2020-09-06 16:38:40 +0800 <JustineClaire65> People are not returning to the office for a number of reasons.  1. Their employers don't want them to go back. 2. They can't all go back because of social distancing. 3. People can do their job from home and prefer wfh. 4. Some people are shielding/nervous. #marr
1302523318931730433 2020-09-06 16:25:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @sammwhiting #marr It's the BBC
1302521739793043456 2020-09-06 16:19:17 +0800 <JustineClaire65> #marr For balance? Do you remember that concept?
1302521552148234241 2020-09-06 16:18:32 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Would you prefer state ownership of the press?  Like North Korea?
1302318663295537152 2020-09-06 02:52:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Mioewing Yes but XR have made exceptions. They did not stop the Guardian or Mirror newspapers.   The tyranny of the far left.
1302317114385149957 2020-09-06 02:46:10 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Good luck with that😂
1302315837865459716 2020-09-06 02:41:06 +0800 <JustineClaire65> So your elite, 'who know what's best' will decide what's good for us to read will you.   Like they do in North Korea.🤦🏻‍♀️
1302310294140653570 2020-09-06 02:19:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> You are not a racist for protesting about illegal people trafficking into this country.  Or else you Zarah Sultana are a people smuggler apologist.  Legal immigration and genuine refugees are welcome as always in our tolerant country.

1302240847979778052 2020-09-05 21:43:07 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Now I'm not an XR supporter at all but I am the only brexit supporting vegan in the village😉  They want to save the planet but not by actually doing anything in their personal lives that might ... well save the planet. This is so funny.   https://t.co/4jrbzaB7Uv
1302232380586029056 2020-09-05 21:09:28 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lbc Majiid. Don't forget there has never been a female Labour leader. Women are not even a minority. Labour is always banging on about diversity and role models but not about women it seems🤨
1302216988882866176 2020-09-05 20:08:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GreenRupertRead I prefer my liberal democracy and free press thank you.  Rather than your 'truth'.
1302216214211485699 2020-09-05 20:05:14 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lbc 'There's been a mixed response to Tony Abbott's appointment'.   Hmmm ... Anyone who is anti government including the MSM are against the appointment. Most of the rest of us suspect because of that reaction he's definitely the right choice 😉
1302211129947688961 2020-09-05 19:45:01 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lbc Majiid you were so soft with Paul who couldn't even answer your questions. I've seen you absolutely destroy callers who wouldn't answer your questions. Could it be because you are fundamentally on his side🤨 Different rules apply?
1302208035834793984 2020-09-05 19:32:44 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lbc People have the right to protest in a liberal democracy. But their right to protest does not trump other peoples' right to travel to work, to visit family &amp; friends, to get to doctors &amp; hospitals and buy their newspapers.

Where elected politicians are supporting the actions of an organisation which is preventing our free press from getting their newspapers to the shelves because those papers don't regurgitate XR propaganda🤦🏻‍♀️
1302192600317861889 2020-09-05 18:31:24 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @lbc @mattfrei We don't need Tony Abbott as a Trade Advisor as we have so many expert trade advisors ringing into your show🙄

1302185215843086336 2020-09-05 18:02:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Looks like @DawnButlerBrent deleted this tweet supporting XR breaking the law. I still got it though😉  https://t.co/TaM7QDfRiz
1302169589518938114 2020-09-05 16:59:57 +0800 <JustineClaire65> The difference between a 3.5% and a 96.5% is that the former believe in an elite 'who think they know best' running the country.  The latter believe in every citizen having a say in how their money is spent and how their country is run.  What are you:
1302167670251454464 2020-09-05 16:52:20 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @NikkiStix55 I agree but I'm older and prefer to work from home and meet when we need to meet. Our CEO wants to close all offices. I have a 21 year old son who has just finished Uni and he needs to work with colleagues because I can't imagine how you learn/form work relationships otherwise.

1302164198303162368 2020-09-05 16:38:32 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @theollyolsson Watching the @Channel4News piece on immigrants crossing the Alps from Italy to France last night. They said that once in France they needed to keep a low profile before they claimed asylum because the French police would just take them back to Italy. Don't mess about the French.
1302161796275597314 2020-09-05 16:28:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> BREAKING: So it's not Russian bots undermining the UK democratic process now but young and middle-aged XR activists with blue, pink or green hair. Trying to control the contents of our free press feels just a tad authoritarian. I expect a full enquiry after a number of arrests🙄.
1302159663379763207 2020-09-05 16:20:31 +0800 <JustineClaire65> NEW: @bethrigby stays in top job at Sky News despite being an anti government activist.

1301244579493171201 2020-09-03 03:44:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GSeligit @RichardBurgon Yes they put themselves above their constituencies and their parties in a lot of cases.
1301243996149342214 2020-09-03 03:41:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GSeligit @RichardBurgon They did. But when the vote went leave parliament agreed to implement the result &amp; so in the 2017 election both parties promised to honour the result. We were frustrated because individual MPs maintained their own remain position &amp; largely did not represent their constituencies.
1301242968360267776 2020-09-03 03:37:54 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @rjheathfield Yes, agreed.  I tend to follow back, it seems polite.  I follow if people asks and I have something in common with them.  I follow if people are interesting and I'm not bothered if this group follow back.  I unfollow if someone is annoying or abusive.
1301241545664999424 2020-09-03 03:32:15 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GSeligit @RichardBurgon I was asking because clearly a lot of Labour candidates got voted to parliament in 2017 on a mandate of honouring the result and then didn't. In 2019 the Tories got a big majority on the basis of Brexit. We voted for the candidates representing the policies not the people.

1301239717032349696 2020-09-03 03:24:59 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GSeligit @RichardBurgon Are you a leaver?
1301232814390759425 2020-09-03 02:57:33 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GSeligit @RichardBurgon I think that and I vote like that as do most people. Hence why Burgon et al are trying to resolve that contradiction.
1301230061174099968 2020-09-03 02:46:36 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @GSeligit @RichardBurgon I vote for a party, you vote for a person😉
1301224104276656131 2020-09-03 02:22:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @channel4news Reporter in Bolton frozen in front of the camera.  Put a bloody jumper on love, you're up t'north😉
1301222774657212418 2020-09-03 02:17:39 +0800 <JustineClaire65> People are trying to judge people by what they do and say and not what colour their skin is.  If everyone did that then there wouldn't be any racism or sexism.
1301220676225970180 2020-09-03 02:09:19 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Pet hates on Twitter:  1. People saying they will ALWAYS follow back ... and don't.  2. People who follow you, you follow back and then they ... unfollow.  Any others?
1301215301820911618 2020-09-03 01:47:58 +0800 <JustineClaire65> I'm embarrassed to say that I agree with Richard Burgon.   I can't see that happening again any time soon🤷🏻‍♀️
1301040392750628864 2020-09-02 14:12:56 +0800 <JustineClaire65> What a great idea. Go and protest in a country that has a terrible human rights record. While you are there check out how they treat women.  Oh ... and you may find a mountain of much needed perspective whilst you are looking. You could use some of that.
1301038722775953408 2020-09-02 14:06:18 +0800 <JustineClaire65> Hmmm .. In my mind comedy is either funny or it's not, political wings are for the birds.
1300864009785282561 2020-09-02 02:32:03 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @Channel4News Trump supporter guest really laying into presenters. @mattfrei losing his rag. Good fun😂
1300711591835566081 2020-09-01 16:26:24 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @DanielCreminUK He hosted a terrible late night TV show that everyone watched when they were drunk. He's now famous for saying snotty and nasty things about anyone who voted leave.
1300671244082319361 2020-09-01 13:46:04 +0800 <JustineClaire65> @AdlerVilhelm @LondonFM1 @MatthewFDonald @MahyarTousi If the cap fits ...
