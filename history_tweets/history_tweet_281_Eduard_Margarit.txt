1330148275626913804 2020-11-21 21:57:16 +0800 <Eduard_Margarit> @RuthAnnHarpur @MrBen___ That is my concerns. That patients and clients are suffering from such views that are not kept in proportion with the professional standards for the profession.

1330135643389825031 2020-11-21 21:07:04 +0800 <Eduard_Margarit> @MrBen___ You are right. I noticed that it‚Äôs the clinical psychologists... in regard to the status of those individuals... from a patient perspective I think I that such strong negative views can only be detrimental.
1330134824829521922 2020-11-21 21:03:49 +0800 <Eduard_Margarit> @GemimaF @BPSOfficial Lovely to hear your experience! Thank you for sharing that with us today.
1330131604036083718 2020-11-21 20:51:01 +0800 <Eduard_Margarit> @MrBen___ I never thought that psychology is such a politically orientated field.

It‚Äôs a waste of my time. I work within the LD department and what I and the rest of the team do is exactly the opposite of what you mentioned.

In fact you should take a few days off, reflect on your practice and come back with an apology.

1329117044759998465 2020-11-19 01:39:31 +0800 <Eduard_Margarit> we need kindness. And today‚Äôs it was such a bad day and yet somehow I managed to find myself surrounded by those people @RuthAnnHarpur and @dranniehickox . So please go out there, share your kindness and knowledge, connect with each other and inspire üåü 4/4
1329117043510177796 2020-11-19 01:39:31 +0800 <Eduard_Margarit> of who I am but also of where I want to be. I am so grateful to each and every single one of those people. One way or another they showed me kindness that nurtured me and inspired me with their ways. We don‚Äôt need heroes... we need mentors, we don‚Äôt need the extraordinary 3/4
1329117042335735815 2020-11-19 01:39:31 +0800 <Eduard_Margarit> of myself as a ‚Äúchoice‚Äù. Someone is choosing me to be their mentor. Today she asked me how I manage to ease my anxiety - both of us are quite anxious even when we are on top of things. I said that I surround myself with amazing people who remind me 2/4
1329117040985182208 2020-11-19 01:39:31 +0800 <Eduard_Margarit> Today it was my second session with my mentee who despite being a rightful professional on her one she reached out to me for mentoring.

1329111863456575488 2020-11-19 01:18:56 +0800 <Eduard_Margarit> Exceptionally happy to hear such kind words.

I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt involve any other branch of psychology or at least include members from the Clinical psychologists with different views.
1327953820161351687 2020-11-15 20:37:17 +0800 <Eduard_Margarit> @DrSathyaPrakas1 @dranniehickox @RFHunt1 @M_Star_Online @BPSOfficial @CoyneoftheRealm @ClinPsychRCW @ProfRobHoward Students should be empowered to think critically and offered the place to do so in a supportive environment yet I feel that at the moment this is not a priority on anyone‚Äôs agenda.
1327953301623758848 2020-11-15 20:35:13 +0800 <Eduard_Margarit> @DrSathyaPrakas1 @dranniehickox @RFHunt1 @M_Star_Online @BPSOfficial @CoyneoftheRealm @ClinPsychRCW @ProfRobHoward Another problem is when this framework aligns with a lecturer personal opinions and they are presenting it as a fact and not an as an alternative. Taking into account that some of the authors teach, I find this very concerning.
1327952844880830468 2020-11-15 20:33:25 +0800 <Eduard_Margarit> @DrSathyaPrakas1 @dranniehickox @RFHunt1 @M_Star_Online @BPSOfficial @CoyneoftheRealm @ClinPsychRCW @ProfRobHoward There are a few things to consider. As a student / trainee you think and assume that someone who is in a position to write a BPS Report is highly qualified AND objective. It can be very hard to question or raise criticism.
1327949930821013504 2020-11-15 20:21:50 +0800 <Eduard_Margarit> @dranniehickox Perhaps people are so outraged by the content they don‚Äôt make it that far and check the references. Or it might be the trust we currently have that such a report can‚Äôt be based on newspaper style articles... who knows...
1327949569708191750 2020-11-15 20:20:24 +0800 <Eduard_Margarit> @dranniehickox A very interesting article! I‚Äôm surprised that the references are also not scrutinised. On a closer look I found them to be very lay orientated rather than scientific. I can‚Äôt find the student Q in the thread - please tag me in the tweet!

That‚Äôs like saying we should normalise suffering and pain too. How would that benefit those alleged ‚Äúpatients‚Äù if I may ask. Also treatment comes in different forms which again, should be a personal choice. And NICE says more than just watch and see...
1318624736998555648 2020-10-21 02:46:50 +0800 <Eduard_Margarit> @DBDouble @psychgeist52 @RuthAnnHarpur @dranniehickox Pharmaceutical companies are exploiting a lot of things. But this is not what the report was focusing on. We must separate the science from the industry.  In general business are exploiting science for profit but it‚Äôs up to us to offer scrutiny.
1318623717061165056 2020-10-21 02:42:47 +0800 <Eduard_Margarit> @DBDouble @psychgeist52 @RuthAnnHarpur @dranniehickox A good cause doesn‚Äôt need to be built on discrediting findings, no matter how small they are because they are equally important. We need a fount of knowledge. Aetiology factors, protective factors and aid can come from very different places. Why cut anything that can help?
1318622289420636161 2020-10-21 02:37:07 +0800 <Eduard_Margarit> @DBDouble @psychgeist52 @RuthAnnHarpur @dranniehickox Because it is written as a rigid dichotomy between biology and psychosocial factors. It dismounts a lot of research (and not just the one on biomarkers - there is more to biology than that) and because I felt ‚Äúpressured‚Äù into finding a social cause to my depression.
1318618157112840193 2020-10-21 02:20:42 +0800 <Eduard_Margarit> @psychgeist52 @DBDouble @RuthAnnHarpur @dranniehickox Right... thank you for your comments but they are just opinions. I think we moved past the point where we design mental health services based on opinions.
