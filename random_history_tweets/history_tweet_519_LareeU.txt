1307050867921747969 2020-09-19 04:16:25 +0800 <LareeU> @johnrobertsFox @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Wow. And it has nothing to do with winning Florida? He is so transparent when he does something nice for someone. There is always a hopeful payback for him. This time it‚Äôs Florida.
1306564031080099843 2020-09-17 20:01:54 +0800 <LareeU> @RudyGiuliani Ya know what. I have no BLM problems near me but a damn deadly virus is rushing our doors. Why not warn us about REAL threats instead of the ones you and Trump are inventing. Pathetic people.
1305624708428242944 2020-09-15 05:49:22 +0800 <LareeU> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Sorry their timing is inconvenient for you. Maybe worrying about being killed due to skin color is inconvenient for those that protest. Get over it daddy.
1305500562083975168 2020-09-14 21:36:03 +0800 <LareeU> @RudyGiuliani Turn up your hearing aid Gramps. He‚Äôs been condemning violence by anyone.

1304532442653618176 2020-09-12 05:29:06 +0800 <LareeU> @PartyUpNorth @JohnWDean Yup. When Trump speaks it‚Äôs either projection or confession. You just have to listen to it and decide if he has done it or is planning on doing it.
1304531989463212034 2020-09-12 05:27:17 +0800 <LareeU> @JohnWDean What won‚Äôt this man say to win the election to stay out of jail for 4 more years. Trump is pathetic. #TrumpLiedPeopleDied
1304513226902843393 2020-09-12 04:12:44 +0800 <LareeU> @realDonaldTrump You aren‚Äôt too bright. The red states only survive because of the Fed taxes blue state citizens pay. Look it up dumb ass.
