1343460419126525952 2020-12-28 15:34:58 +0800 <AllMenAreEqual2> @tobeequal Ward, you sacrificed a lot for this battle. Hope you can go back to enjoy your retirement and a normal life.
1343454490377113601 2020-12-28 15:11:25 +0800 <AllMenAreEqual2> @tobeequal Prop16 was backed by state teachers' and nurses' unions, California Chamber of Commerce, California Business Roundtable, UC Regents, UA, PG&amp;E, Pelosi, Feinstein, Harris, Newsom, and all of the Bay Area’s professional sports teams - the Warriors, 49ers, Giants, Athletics, etc.

1341604296240975872 2020-12-23 12:39:24 +0800 <AllMenAreEqual2> @tobeequal I was wondering if the failed #Prop16 that Weber authored was in her resume.

If we allow them to target Chinese this time, next time it may be another nationality.

1332380640541433856 2020-11-28 01:47:53 +0800 <AllMenAreEqual2> As a symbol of the world’s democracy, why America is being laughed at now? Because people no longer have fear of God in their hearts. If you do not fear God, you must not respect the Constitution; the Constitution is still there, but where are the citizens who respect it? 1/4.
1332380512212586496 2020-11-28 01:47:23 +0800 <AllMenAreEqual2> If you do not fear God, you must not love the country; the Stars and Stripes are still flying, but where are the patriots who are willing to shed blood and sacrifice for it? 2/4.
1332380464850509826 2020-11-28 01:47:11 +0800 <AllMenAreEqual2> If you don't fear God, you will not obey God's word; the church buildings are still magnificent, but where are the Puritans who keep God's commandments? 3/4.
1332380422588645380 2020-11-28 01:47:01 +0800 <AllMenAreEqual2> No external enemy can put a yoke on Americans unless they voluntarily become slaves. No external enemy can destroy the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, unless the Americans themselves remove the Bible from the foundation of the country. 4/4.
1332375412689670145 2020-11-28 01:27:07 +0800 <AllMenAreEqual2> 没有任何外在的敌人能够给美国人头上戴上枷锁，除非美国人自愿为奴。没有任何外在的敌人能够摧毁美国宪法和独立宣言，除非美国人自己将圣经从立国根基中抽掉。
1332374285046857734 2020-11-28 01:22:38 +0800 <AllMenAreEqual2> 美国作为民主灯塔,何以沦为全球笑柄?因为人心中已经没有了对上帝的敬畏. 不敬畏上帝,必不尊重宪法;宪法还在,但尊重宪法的公民在哪里呢?不敬畏上帝,必不热爱国家;星条旗还在飘扬,但愿意为它流血牺牲的爱国者在哪里呢?  不敬畏上帝,必不遵守上帝的道;教堂的建筑依然宏伟,但谨守上帝诫命的清教徒在哪里呢?

1331508008589824000 2020-11-25 16:00:22 +0800 <AllMenAreEqual2> Very few Americans have the interest of knowing what’s going on in the rest of the world. This is very different from people in Asian countries where many are very curious about other countries in the world. So when they have time and money, first thing is to travel abroad.

1325480879448190976 2020-11-09 00:50:42 +0800 <AllMenAreEqual2> @areyes12951 Thank you! #Yeson16 actually collected 30 million from elite donators while #NoOn16 only raised 1.8 million from 8000 working class Californians. #Yeson16 lost by 12% in the election. Money cannot buy justice. God’s grace is sufficient.

The Yes16 campaign's 20 million donations from handful elite donors and long list of endorsements including state teachers' and nurses' unions, United Airlines, PG&amp;E, UC Regents, weren't enough to push Prop 16 to victory.  https://t.co/s1q1xD79xI

That’s the reason why California is the largest economy in the states. Evidently, we have done something right. Vote No on divisive and racist #Prop16!
1320948579049959425 2020-10-27 12:40:57 +0800 <AllMenAreEqual2> @thesherylralph System racism is to allow government to legalize racism via laws to treat people differently based on race. That’s exactly what Prop16 is going to do if it were to pass.

Let’s keep discrimination illegal.

Authors of Prop16 avoided the hard work to fix it, instead they fast tracked a measure to repeal our state constitution which helped build a successful UC system. Don’t let them destroy our UC system. No#Prop16!
