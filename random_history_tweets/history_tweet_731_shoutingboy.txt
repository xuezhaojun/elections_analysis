1344069871475195904 2020-12-30 07:56:43 +0800 <shoutingboy> @TheH2 A competent POTUS would have spent lots of time talking about that with a specific proposal in Congress and a Romney type to run it. Congress would have passed it, nobody wants to be against medicine. Basically, “Warp Speed” for distribution and shots.
1344069508533604353 2020-12-30 07:55:17 +0800 <shoutingboy> @TheH2 Oh golly, I have a long list. One that comes to mind: starting in July (when it became clear that there were promising vaccine candidates that might come soon) there should have been a coordinated proposal for nationwide distribution with spending for infrastructure and staff…
1344069117133742080 2020-12-30 07:53:43 +0800 <shoutingboy> @bustyshacklford My clicking “like” should be construed as “you have as much of my sympathy and support as you want, which can be zero if you want, that’s cool”

1344031691636047872 2020-12-30 05:25:00 +0800 <shoutingboy> @JakeSherman @yashar I remember when the Senate passed a halfassed hacked-together version of healthcare reform in 2009, because of course it’d be fixed in conference. Then they lost their 60th Senate vote, and the Senate bill ended up becoming law.  so… maybe the Senate shouldn’t do that
1344019218107265025 2020-12-30 04:35:26 +0800 <shoutingboy> @AsteadWesley I tried to watch the show but all the rooms have three walls. How does that make sense? Any time there's a storm the rain would blow in and ruin all their fancy artwork 😕

My money's on Elric (probably smarter and his sword is crazy magic) but Conan's beaten evil magic before.  If Elric can prep at all, Conan has no chance. Elric'll spring a fire elemental or some shit.

1344016884136439808 2020-12-30 04:26:10 +0800 <shoutingboy> @DebBRVA @yashar @zoe_alliyah There's no such thing as "safe" when there's a deadly airborne disease. Especially when it's as crazy widespread as it is in Southern California right now.  There's safer and less safe, but there isn't "safe".  And in film, you *can't* do masking and social distance.
1344016394027900929 2020-12-30 04:24:13 +0800 <shoutingboy> @yashar @zoe_alliyah I mean  On account of the deadly respiratory pandemic and all ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1344011876854730753 2020-12-30 04:06:16 +0800 <shoutingboy> @TheH2 And here I'm not talking about Romney-level competence, either. I'm talking just about ordinary American mediocrity--an Obama-level president (i.e. appoint middling competent people, let them do their jobs, stay on message) would have saved a lot of lives.
1344011584931131392 2020-12-30 04:05:07 +0800 <shoutingboy> @TheH2 I think there are a lot of areas where competent federal leadership could have improved our outcomes tremendously, yes. And in a world where we had that competent leadership, a more centralized structure would have improved things further.
1343988703752908800 2020-12-30 02:34:11 +0800 <shoutingboy> @bdomenech @TheH2 I don’t think it’s fair to say Fauci “abhors” the leeway. I think he’s just saying—and IMO plausibly—that the US’s decentralized structure is a disadvantage in those situations where we do want centralized planning. (A better POTUS would have managed it better, of course.)

1343981660392472576 2020-12-30 02:06:12 +0800 <shoutingboy> @moodyredhead @MickeyBlowtorch I think there’re going to be weird consequences, yes. If you’re worried about infringements on liberty, I think a likely scenario is something like: masks have to be allowed, which poses new security risks, so places start demanding IDs and fingerprints where they didn’t used to.

1343979562389008384 2020-12-30 01:57:52 +0800 <shoutingboy> @MickeyBlowtorch I don’t see it being required (except maybe when there’s an active pandemic somewhere in the world). But I think it’s going to be far more common, and I could imagine new laws requiring businesses and public places to *allow* facemasks.

1343974002327359488 2020-12-30 01:35:46 +0800 <shoutingboy> @JimPethokoukis I don’t think it’s more complicated than (a) More targeted help would be hard, (b) Arguing “people shouldn’t get $2,000” would also be hard, and (c) Our Congress folks have already had a pretty hard year and want to take it easy ☺️

1343949909007900672 2020-12-30 00:00:02 +0800 <shoutingboy> @iowahawkblog When Ellen DeGeneres had a sitcom, there was an episode where she found out that Emma Thompson has only been pretending to be English, she’s actually from a small town in Indiana.  So... that, but unironically, I guess?

1343714312775290880 2020-12-29 08:23:51 +0800 <shoutingboy> @bendreyfuss Hm, a closer example might be DC's TV multiverse (Arrow, Flash, Supergirl, etc., multiple universes but with back-and-forth between them), which is completely distinct from the cinematic universe.
1343713895848951808 2020-12-29 08:22:12 +0800 <shoutingboy> @bendreyfuss There is one example--the Chris Pine STAR TREK timeline, which is basically the standard STAR TREK universe up until, like, 20 years before The Old Show, then goes in a different direction.  But I don't think there were any TV shows running *while* they were making those movies.

1343387941834350592 2020-12-28 10:46:58 +0800 <shoutingboy> @AdmiralOfAges @VerumVulnero1 It looks like there’s a protocol for the President to request recision of funds that were appropriated. This may be his way of saving face—he signs the bill, formally requests recision of the foreign aid, and the request dies in Congress.
1343387514015367168 2020-12-28 10:45:16 +0800 <shoutingboy> @VerumVulnero1 And it looks like the GOP sold him on a deal—he signs the bill and they “investigate” the voter fraud. I’m guessing they agreed to contest the elector slates on Jan. 6.

1343246131904405504 2020-12-28 01:23:28 +0800 <shoutingboy> @MollyRatty And Rubio has a habit of doing this. If Trump says “the Swedes are putting LSD in our hamburgers“, you can count on Rubio to tweet something like “it is vitally important to maintain the safety of our food supply“. Push back, and he’ll say, “what, food safety isn’t important?“
1343245613199069185 2020-12-28 01:21:25 +0800 <shoutingboy> @MollyRatty I think there’s a legit worry that a lot of people are saying “COVID’s a hoax, all the experts are lying, open everything up now“, and a tweet like this can encourage those people (and curry favor with them) while maintaining plausible denyability.

If it was thermal energy or whatnot, why not just use cows and give them a “matrix” of a nice meadow?

1342215104612294656 2020-12-25 05:06:32 +0800 <shoutingboy> Alas, too late to do anything about it now. And let me be clear, I think Fauci really screwed this up. People are going to go back to normal much faster than they should, because they think the experts are bullshitting them—because the experts are, in fact, bullshitting them.
1342215103496609794 2020-12-25 05:06:32 +0800 <shoutingboy> And that very much isn’t his job. He should have been saying “the higher the vaccination, the less the disease spreads“, and try to illustrate what disease spread looks like at various levels. And he should have let other people make the judgment of what to do based on that.
1342215102150311936 2020-12-25 05:06:32 +0800 <shoutingboy> And in fact, he’s admitted that those numbers depend largely on what psychological effect he’s trying to produce. One month he’s giving a low number so people will say “the end is in sight“. Another month he gives a high number so people won’t stop pushing...
1342215101248507905 2020-12-25 05:06:31 +0800 <shoutingboy> So Fauci might have been thinking “at 60% vaccination we get one level of herd immunity. At 90% we get a much higher level.“ but he doesn’t explain all of that, and to an audience that thinks herd immunity is an either-or thing, it sounds like he’s just changing his mind.
1342215100078325760 2020-12-25 05:06:31 +0800 <shoutingboy> …if each infected person spreads the disease to .95 people, and a million people are infected, it’ll take a long time for the disease to go away. If each infected person infects .05 people, it goes away much faster.
1342215098681544704 2020-12-25 05:06:31 +0800 <shoutingboy> As I understand it, herd immunity is a sliding scale. Above a certain level of population resistance, the disease spread slows and the pandemic will eventually peter out. How quickly it peters out depends on how high the immunity is…
1342215096639004673 2020-12-25 05:06:30 +0800 <shoutingboy> Thought: a lot of the communication blunders (like Fauci moving the goalposts on herd immunity) probably come down to experts oversimplifying complex issues because they’re worried we’ll misunderstand them…

1341983546651496449 2020-12-24 13:46:25 +0800 <shoutingboy> @trumwill @jbarro But it’s easy to imagine a scenario four years from now where the GOP is a smoking wreckage, but the Democrats are running a weak candidate — an extremely old Biden, or a not very popular Harris. In a situation like that, I could imagine Christie picking up the pieces.

I am not in favor of actively *honoring* the traitors who fought to destroy America because they were that committed to owning humans. So... forgiveness, but not a frickin' statue in the US Capitol.

I think that’ll be worldwide in the future. When there’s a contagious disease outbreak anywhere, lots of people will stop eating indoors.
1341084380878368769 2020-12-22 02:13:27 +0800 <shoutingboy> @NRafter @jbarro @KevinWGlass Don’t know how many folks will be like me, but, yes, I do expect lasting effects on the hospitality industry. Comparatively minor during flu season (where the weather driving people indoors will be a strong counterbalance), more significant if there’s an outbreak somewhere.

1341053970299535361 2020-12-22 00:12:36 +0800 <shoutingboy> @jbarro I think there’ll be *more* masking than there was in 2019. It may not be typical but we’ll all be used to seeing masks around. I’m figuring I’ll probably be masked in airports unless I have a reason not to be, even when it isn’t flu season.

But “Greensleeves“ is so prominent in our culture that I can’t help thinking of it whenever I hear the Christmas version.
1340792105212420099 2020-12-21 06:52:03 +0800 <shoutingboy> @jayinlincoln @whignewtons My problem with “What child is this“ is no matter how good it is, it’s still new words to a song about a guy‘s ex-lover. I mean, I don’t care how good the Christmas words are, if you sing them to the tune of “Wonderwall“ it’s never gonna be a Christmas carol in my book.  https://t.co/lA3hFdH542

1340707148817305600 2020-12-21 01:14:28 +0800 <shoutingboy> I do think the latest version of the guidelines take a good approach—the more elderly (75+) with frontline essential workers, less elderly with other essential workers and those with comorbidities.

1340703620988166144 2020-12-21 01:00:26 +0800 <shoutingboy> When it’s all said, racial minorities took a disproportionate part of the risk in keeping the country functioning over the last year, and I don’t think it would be bad for policy to recognize that. #FoundTheLib
1340703619792863232 2020-12-21 01:00:26 +0800 <shoutingboy> Elderly are far more at risk from the disease if they get it. But essential workers are far more at risk of getting the disease in the first place, and, thus, of spreading it to others. (And it looks like the vaccine does reduce the risk of spreading.)
1340703618794627075 2020-12-21 01:00:26 +0800 <shoutingboy> If there’s no clear public health advantage in prioritizing the elderly over essential workers for vaccination or vice-versa—and that’s how it looks to me—I don’t see what’s wrong with letting racial equity be a plus-factor in making the decision. #ConfessYourUnpopularOpinion

1340463217189928965 2020-12-20 09:05:10 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Holden114 Yes, if the person owns the field, they are responding to aggression. But that means that that person’s claim, that their violence is justified, rests on their claim to own the property in the first place. If you dispute private property, you also dispute their right to violence.
1340461693378256896 2020-12-20 08:59:06 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Holden114 Well, if I walk into a field, am I committing “aggression“? I am, *only* if that field belongs to someone else. So the assertion that the violence by the person who expels me is not “aggression“ assumes that person actually owns the property, which is begging the question here.
1340460286373896193 2020-12-20 08:53:31 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Holden114 But in this case, “the existence of property implies the threat of force to defend it“ seems to me not just reasonable, but self-evidently true. And I don’t think serious libertarians disagree with that!
1340459905954664448 2020-12-20 08:52:00 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Holden114 I admit to a bias.

1340428860605693952 2020-12-20 06:48:38 +0800 <shoutingboy> Random thoughts about the Joss Whedon thing: 1. I absolutely understand why none of the Justice League stars are being specific (yet?), but until I see specifics, I can’t really judge.

1340426550353809411 2020-12-20 06:39:28 +0800 <shoutingboy> This seems like an unalloyed good to me, but I suspect it would be like Uber‘s unlimited surge pricing — something that makes economists nod enthusiastically, but turns into horrible press in the real world. The human sense of “fairness“ is idiosyncratic and really prickly.
1340426548969553920 2020-12-20 06:39:27 +0800 <shoutingboy> Crazy thought: rich people will always find a way to jump in line for the vaccine. So why not channel it? How about a program where, if you sponsor 1000 vaccinations in the third world, you get to jump to the front of the line in your home country? (Thoughts, @asymmetricinfo?)

1340012657487671296 2020-12-19 03:14:48 +0800 <shoutingboy> @pegobry I think Tolkien’s structure was, “This is the story of how the rightful king defeated Sauron and restored his kingdom—and how did it happen? It was all done by this hobbit nobody had heard of!” (As Aragorn makes explicit, having Frodo help crown him.)

The article said "we should expect 12 to 18 months, faster than that is imaginable but would be really surprising, and it'll take another few months to get the shots out there."  That's not a smear of anyone. 18 months would have been damned good.

(And if you're really worried about people confusing him with his father, "Reverend" doesn't help.)  But on subsequent use, I'd say "Dr. King"--or just "King".
1338558812211408897 2020-12-15 02:57:44 +0800 <shoutingboy> @asymmetricinfo I think it isn't that they're fleeing faster or more successfully. It's just that when a ship starts sinking, you discover how many rats were there all along (as they all move above the waterline) so it's really dramatic.

1338551686340612096 2020-12-15 02:29:25 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Marcstout2 What they actually said in that article turned out to be right on the money—vaccine in 12 to 18 months, faster is conceivable given that we’re making unprecedented efforts, and it’ll take a few months to roll out.

1338539129622052866 2020-12-15 01:39:32 +0800 <shoutingboy> @JonahDispatch I think it’s legit to say to Dems “You put us on that road”. But it’s not legit to say that as an excuse for barreling faster down the road.

He sure looks to me like he’s said a vaccine would get us back to normal by EOY. The NBC article said it would take at least 12 months for development *and distribution*, which is about right for most of us.

Lucy was the "fussbudget", Linus was nerdy and had the blanket, Schroeder was the musician, Pig-Pen was dirty, etc etc. Patty, Violet, and Shermy were just... normal kids Charlie Brown's age who didn't like him much.
1338287320617766912 2020-12-14 08:58:56 +0800 <shoutingboy> @NathanWurtzel Originally they were the "Charlie Brown's age" kids, Lucy and Schroeder were younger, and Linus was much younger (just a baby).  It ended up with Lucy and Schroeder being essentially Chuck's age, and his old contemporaries were basically for crowd scenes.

1338149239025627149 2020-12-13 23:50:14 +0800 <shoutingboy> @MCBC_Austin Nobody is saying PhDs should be mocked. But PhDs who expect to be called “doctor”—other than, perhaps, by their current students—yeah, I’ll mock them.  I respect your degree. If you ask me to call you “master” (and you are not teaching me Kung Fu) that respect will lessen.
1338146410663821313 2020-12-13 23:39:00 +0800 <shoutingboy> @MCBC_Austin None of my professors asked to be called “doctor”. My dad’s a professor and he never asked to be called “doctor” either.

1338143827534626818 2020-12-13 23:28:44 +0800 <shoutingboy> @kelhorse I suppose the Founding Fathers could have tried Trump’s approach: Go to court and show up with bullshit.  I guess the difference is, they actually had *real* grievances...

1338139413541339136 2020-12-13 23:11:12 +0800 <shoutingboy> @DouglasEmhoff If a man puts “Dr” in his Twitter handle when he’s got a PhD (or an EdD), he is and should be thoroughly mocked for it.
1338138915673309184 2020-12-13 23:09:13 +0800 <shoutingboy> If national healing requires me to take an EdD seriously, I think we have a problem 😰
1338138550408073218 2020-12-13 23:07:46 +0800 <shoutingboy> @kelhorse Well, if you don’t have evidence you can bring into a court, it’s more a “you problem” than an “us problem”.  Every president has had *some* people who believe—without, or in spite of, hard evidence—that he isn’t really a legit president.
1338138059427074049 2020-12-13 23:05:49 +0800 <shoutingboy> @FormerlyCBM @DeebsFLA When did Doom actually get his doctorate, though? He was expelled from Empire State U after causing that explosion. He did pursue higher studies with those Tibetan monks but I don’t think it was a formal degree program.

That didn’t happen this year because the Trump legal team talks about evidence but doesn’t actually bring it to court.
1338125606869893120 2020-12-13 22:16:20 +0800 <shoutingboy> @kelhorse @AndrewCMcCarthy @FoxNews It’s bad that millions of Americans can’t trust this election result. But given that there’s been no actual *evidence* of fraud (fit to bring into a courtroom), maybe the blame for that should go on the President who’s been spouting bogus conspiracy theories to them?

1337891082021920770 2020-12-13 06:44:25 +0800 <shoutingboy> @jenniferlee_75 In my experience, mistletoe kissing is only either (a) existing couples, (b) people who were already both looking for an opportunity to kiss, or (c) people who are on friendly kissing terms already.

1337870796874641408 2020-12-13 05:23:49 +0800 <shoutingboy> @AndyGrewal The cultural math can get wacky. My understanding is, English surgeons are called “mister” because originally surgeon was a lower class, less-educated specialty than physician — and as it became more prestigious, surgeons made it a point of perverse pride to keep the old title.
1337870222808662017 2020-12-13 05:21:32 +0800 <shoutingboy> @AndyGrewal My experience from college (way back when) and as a faculty brat was, professors never called each other “doctor“, because having a doctorate was taken for granted. Students would sometimes call professors “doctor“ as a sign of respect, but it was not expected.
1337866350086123520 2020-12-13 05:06:08 +0800 <shoutingboy> @pegobry Why do they say "Dr. Jill Biden" but they don't say "Dr. Michelle Obama" (JD)? I don't want to say it's racism but I have to assume it's racism 😢💔
1337836231204380672 2020-12-13 03:06:27 +0800 <shoutingboy> @EsotericCD I think at the time, censors had to act like they didn’t even know the word could be dirty. Clearly her name just meant that she was, like, acting like Goldfinger‘s pet cat!
1337835914198859776 2020-12-13 03:05:12 +0800 <shoutingboy> @EsotericCD IIRC, that’s one of the rare cases where a movie’s plot made more sense than the book’s. I believe in the book, Goldfinger was plotting to rob Fort Knox. In the movie Bond reasonably notes that gold is really heavy, and figures out his real plan is to irradiate the gold there.
1337834317041430528 2020-12-13 02:58:51 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Klonick @jessesingal @ggreenwald And we’re watching Republicans make a last-ditch effort to give Joe Biden as much power over the Internet as possible. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The bit about “unique login identifier“ for donors? Not a Cuomo fan but I honestly don’t see what’s scandalous about “donors get to video-chat with Whoopi Goldberg“.
1337830735642677253 2020-12-13 02:44:37 +0800 <shoutingboy> @DanCrenshawTX You tried to give the most equivocal, mealy-mouthed support to Texas’s effort to straight-up steal the election. It won’t be forgotten. “Yes but I had a bullshit reason for supporting it” may fly when you tell it to the bathroom mirror but it won’t work for a larger audience.

1337830131868393472 2020-12-13 02:42:13 +0800 <shoutingboy> @JonahDispatch We gotta give some thought to George McClellan, who tried to lose the Civil War at the ballot box because Lincoln wouldn’t let him lose it on the battlefield.

1337819199251443713 2020-12-13 01:58:47 +0800 <shoutingboy> @roddreher ...and if God wants us to keep Trump in the White House, I think God is clever enough to give some decent arguments, and maybe some evidence, to Trump’s lawyers.

1337815581618184193 2020-12-13 01:44:24 +0800 <shoutingboy> @futuredci @CheeseForEvery1 What differentiates it is that ordinarily a case is tried by a lower court and appealed to SCOTUS. If it’s state-vs-state, it goes straight to SCOTUS.

1337798953073475585 2020-12-13 00:38:20 +0800 <shoutingboy> @JenInOveralls Honestly, if BLACK PANTHER hadn’t been such a hit and if Boseman had just quit instead of dying, I think they would’ve recast T’Challa. But as it is, I think they feel (appropriately) that T’Challa has to be buried with him.  Maybe the next BP’s costume will be a bit different…
1337798148803055617 2020-12-13 00:35:08 +0800 <shoutingboy> @futuredci @CheeseForEvery1 All nine agree that SCOTUS *can* choose to hear such cases, the disagreement AIUI is only on whether the court can choose to ignore the cases.

Harder to see how they recast/reboot a small part of the MCU and leave the rest intact. But who knows? If the Mouse decides kids want a new Bruce Banner again...

1337791988758769664 2020-12-13 00:10:39 +0800 <shoutingboy> @DeerTrivia @NotThatGarth @jaketapper Yeah. Trump could sue, because he suffered the alleged harm (he’s saying they took votes from him)—but because that wouldn’t be a state-vs-state case, he’d have to sue normally in a lower court, instead of going straight to the Supreme Court. (He has been, and he’s losing those.)
1337791391028559872 2020-12-13 00:08:17 +0800 <shoutingboy> @GordieMcDonald @jaketapper Not even much respect. It’s more like:  2 justices: I guess we gotta listen to this BS 7 justices: Oh no we don’t
1337790089385058304 2020-12-13 00:03:06 +0800 <shoutingboy> @JenInOveralls @BalianMero (I think the biggest exception is Spidey/Peter Parker... which is owned by Sony, onscreen anyway. When Holland is done, I expect Sony will recast/reboot, and if that means they have to leave the MCU, I think they’ll do that.)
1337789561150132225 2020-12-13 00:01:00 +0800 <shoutingboy> @JenInOveralls @BalianMero But very few MCU characters are so well known to the public *in their secret identities*. Superman has to be Clark Kent. Batman has to be Bruce Wayne. But to the extent people need a “Captain America” at all, I think they’re open to it being Bucky Barnes or whoever.
1337789099470548992 2020-12-12 23:59:10 +0800 <shoutingboy> @JenInOveralls @BalianMero That’s an interesting long-term question for the MCU. Will there never be another Tony Stark or Steve Rodgers? Franchises like Batman have solved this by saying “~3 films, then reboot.” But MCU won’t want a full reboot…

1337535104822853632 2020-12-12 07:09:53 +0800 <shoutingboy> @AndyGrewal That’s kind of like saying “driving a car doesn’t destroy your marriage“. I mean, ordinarily, it doesn’t. But under some circumstances — like if you drive a car into your spouse at high speed…

Discouraging masks was one facet of that.  That said, I’m not aware that Fauci ever “laughed“ at mask wearing.

The technical term is “shameless bullshit” but I think NRO wanted to put it in laymen’s terms.

They could import Killmonger from another universe. Or, heck, a Killmonger clone or robot, played by MBJ.  They definitely need to get MBJ under contract…
1337473788280107008 2020-12-12 03:06:14 +0800 <shoutingboy> @ReignOfApril @vexedinthecity Yeah. So far, the MCU has not done the “same hero new actor” thing, and I don’t think they want to start now. But they can (and I expect, will) do the “different character is now that hero” thing—a new Wakandan hero will be the Panther, a new person in the Iron Man suit, etc.

(Since current precedent seems to be that SCOTUS can choose to ignore a case where it has original jurisdiction.)
1337451414910472192 2020-12-12 01:37:20 +0800 <shoutingboy> @whignewtons @jadler1969 @JonahDispatch @SeanTrende ...3. SCOTUS grants cert *and* adds Trump to the suit, says "States don't have standing, Trump does, and since it's 'Trump v GA/PA/etc' we don't have original jurisdiction", remands to lower court.  And imaginably  4. SCOTUS grants cert, and actually hears this crazy case?
1337451027587469314 2020-12-12 01:35:48 +0800 <shoutingboy> @whignewtons @jadler1969 @JonahDispatch @SeanTrende So it sounds like these are likely scenarios--do I have this right?  1. SCOTUS denies cert, one or two dissent saying "we have mandatory original jurisdiction"  2. SCOTUS grants cert and immediately dismisses because TX doesn't have standing to sue...

I.e. it’s no longer a purely state-against-state court, so even those dissenters could say it should go to a lower court first. Anything to that?

Jesus was also conceived immaculately (without original sin), but the term “immaculate conception” isn’t historically used for him, since Jesus’ sinlessness was never controversial (in the church)...

1335309557615132676 2020-12-06 03:46:22 +0800 <shoutingboy> @NathanWurtzel Trump is the President and his legal team is formally asking states to ignore the results of their elections and pick different electors so Trump is the winner.  That is a really big fucking deal and it is appropriate for the WaPo to put Republican office holders on the spot.

1335308285419823105 2020-12-06 03:41:18 +0800 <shoutingboy> @aelfred_D People miss the whole point of the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican because they don’t get that (as Jesus’s audience understood) the Pharisee *is a good man* (and a pious one) and the Publican *is bad*. The point is, “The bad man was justified, not the good one.”

1335034068816154624 2020-12-05 09:31:40 +0800 <shoutingboy> @FormerlyCBM @KIR_bigg50 No *ballot* is going to have an address on it because, y’know, ballots are secret.  In California, my mail-in ballot goes in an official envelope. I have to sign and date that envelope and write my home address on it, and presumably that gets checked. I assume GA is similar.

1334922624913166336 2020-12-05 02:08:50 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Popehat I tried to red through the announcement and get the answer “can I go for a solo run? Can I walk the dog?” and I couldn’t figure it out. (I don’t live in LA but I thought it might be a preview of local restrictions.)
1334921903820062720 2020-12-05 02:05:58 +0800 <shoutingboy> @BryanONolan I think that’s just saying they know the immune response lasts at least three months because they’ve been able to check three months later. In a month they’ll be able to tell us how it looks after four months.
1334919986301685761 2020-12-05 01:58:21 +0800 <shoutingboy> @BryanONolan Link? I can’t find any info like that.
1334862654209323009 2020-12-04 22:10:31 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Latentem I think the idea is, that gets people to maintain their efforts until vaccination is widespread—and gives people a pretty firm end-date to put on the calendar. Honestly that sounds like a good idea to me.

1334859365937868800 2020-12-04 21:57:27 +0800 <shoutingboy> @BiasedGirl There’s no evidence that there’s any more fraud than there was in 2016. So anyone who says “all I care about is addressing fraud” needs to show me the receipts of them doing the same thing four years ago.
1334859006272106499 2020-12-04 21:56:02 +0800 <shoutingboy> @brad_polumbo I... don’t see what’s wrong? Biden is saying (in a joking way) that if he felt like he had an extreme disagreement w Obama on policy he’d resign, but he’d try to resign in a way that didn’t bring attention to the disagreement. And implying that he thinks Harris would do the same.
1334858254338326528 2020-12-04 21:53:02 +0800 <shoutingboy> So I remember a lot of people saying very firmly that no of course Michelle Malkin doesn’t *agree* with Nick Fuentes. Oh no no no! No, it’s just that she feels very strongly that we shouldn’t be criticizing other people on the right.  In fairness, those people were full of shit.

1334580280762372096 2020-12-04 03:28:28 +0800 <shoutingboy> @NoahCRothman How about a compromise: We make sure the vaccine is available to everyone without cost, and then we damn well DO stratify society to privilege people who are actually getting their shots.

The trial court and lower appellate courts are gear-check bosses, you just have to get past them one way or another to get to the boss that really matters, SCOTUS.
1332429627621425155 2020-11-28 05:02:33 +0800 <shoutingboy> @npcox She said that in the context of mischaracterizing the Supreme Court injunction, and she pointed to her completely irrelevant PhD as a reason to respect her (stupidly irrelevant) criticism. This was dumb! If you say a dumb thing on Twitter you might get mocked for it!
1332427386550292480 2020-11-28 04:53:38 +0800 <shoutingboy> @npcox Per the injunction, you absolutely can restrict attendance at churches, require services to be outside, or even close them altogether. But you have to meet strict scrutiny. It’s very hard to do that if you allow indoor dining with far less restrictions than mass.
1332426941987655680 2020-11-28 04:51:52 +0800 <shoutingboy> @npcox The Supreme Court did not hold that churches can do “whatever they want“ so Johnson’s criticism was completely irrelevant. The Supreme Court just held that you can’t put *more* onerous restrictions on churches than you do on other essential businesses.
1332426191995772928 2020-11-28 04:48:54 +0800 <shoutingboy> @npcox I don’t see how I can do that until I first make an error to reconcile with it 😕

1332425067746131969 2020-11-28 04:44:26 +0800 <shoutingboy> @CJSlaby @neontaster To elaborate, the Supreme Court did not say “churches can do whatever they want“, as Johnson alleges. And she held up her PhD in a completely unrelated area (early American gossip) as a reason for us to respect her ignorant opinion. She earned the dunks.
1332424311743807492 2020-11-28 04:41:25 +0800 <shoutingboy> @CJSlaby @neontaster So it sounds like two people who have no professional expertise in the Constitution or in the early Republic both expressed an opinion about the recent Supreme Court injunction.  Of course Neon’s opinion wasn’t stupid, so I think that gives him the slight edge here?
1332423340355506176 2020-11-28 04:37:34 +0800 <shoutingboy> @chwinburn @AGHamilton29 The usual response I’m seeing from the diehards is “of course we didn’t show the evidence of fraud in lower courts, that would just tip our hand. We’re saving that evidence for SCOTUS.“  and yeah, they have no idea what the Supreme Court actually does.

1331986737975836672 2020-11-26 23:42:40 +0800 <shoutingboy> @captainkudzu I’m saying a signature check would at least confirm or deny whether bad signatures were routinely being accepted, even though those signatures can’t be connected to specific votes.
1331986376678539264 2020-11-26 23:41:13 +0800 <shoutingboy> @MiddleMolly I know! But what I’m saying is, if they could examine the envelopes (without the ballots) and found lots of signatures that should have been rejected, that would at least substantiate the claim that there was something wrong with the GA election.

1331846527866654720 2020-11-26 14:25:31 +0800 <shoutingboy> @TexasWasBack @AGHamilton29 If it’s this, it specifically says the envelopes with the signatures *have* been saved (not with the ballots). So... can the Trump team look at those signatures? Again, if they found lots of bad signatures, that would show a problem with the election.   https://t.co/Hy63MSU7cc
1331844482111733760 2020-11-26 14:17:23 +0800 <shoutingboy> @TexasWasBack @AGHamilton29 @TexasWasBack It looks like the “11Alive” link got truncated, could you post just that one link? I’d rather read a story about the issue than dive into the Georgia Constitution...
1331839922710269952 2020-11-26 13:59:16 +0800 <shoutingboy> @AGHamilton29 … and I can’t think of any good reason why Trump’s team wouldn’t be allowed to look at those signatures. Which makes me suspect they can, they have, and they haven’t found enough problems to do their case any good? But I can’t find anything definitive on it.
1331839504135536640 2020-11-26 13:57:36 +0800 <shoutingboy> @AGHamilton29 Some thing I’m not clear on — is Trump’s campaign allowed to go back and examine the envelope signatures? If they find lots of bad signatures, that would at least show problems with the GA election, even if the signatures can no longer (of course) be tied to specific votes…

1331268213452066816 2020-11-25 00:07:30 +0800 <shoutingboy> @baseballcrank I think people keep confusing two kinds of “close election”. This election was really really close in the sense that one decision or news cycle could have flipped it—call that “2016-close”.  But it wasn’t “2000-close” where a recount or court challenge could reverse it.

1330637423936630786 2020-11-23 06:20:58 +0800 <shoutingboy> @DSiPaint @CSLewisDaily So… CSL is quite clear on distinguishing “Christ’s death reconciles us to God” (in the Bible!) from “Christ’s death paid the price for our sins” (not actually in the Bible, as that headline accurate notes, though many people think it follows clearly and directly from the Bible.)

1330601927592144896 2020-11-23 03:59:55 +0800 <shoutingboy> @ParodyTheodore Is this one of those nightmare scenarios? Like, "The Beatles have to replace Paul with a member of Hanson--which one do they take?"
1330594824022441984 2020-11-23 03:31:41 +0800 <shoutingboy> @LPDonovan Yeah, it’s certainly a factor. Hypothetically, Javanka can make arguments like “Dad, here is how ABC will position you better for 2024” and he’ll listen. They know better than to say things like “ABC is good for the Republican Party”, because why would Trump care about that?
1330593780135653377 2020-11-23 03:27:33 +0800 <shoutingboy> @iamwhoisme @asymmetricinfo I don’t see Manchin and Sinema voting to end the filibuster and expand the Supreme Court, and in a 50-50 Senate they need every vote.  But there has been  A  LOT  of stuff I didn’t see coming.

1330583707372056577 2020-11-23 02:47:31 +0800 <shoutingboy> @LPDonovan I honestly don’t think Trump is even thinking that far. I think for him it’s no more than “Tell me how I really won.” Tell him that and you get to go on TV.

1330574528158732288 2020-11-23 02:11:03 +0800 <shoutingboy> @EsotericCD Fair point but the devil on my shoulder still wants to troll them with “good job sending all that money to Amy McGrath, folks ☺️”

1330561410468700161 2020-11-23 01:18:55 +0800 <shoutingboy> @GerryDales It looks like a bad headline for a less bad article—the article is about how health care has disproportionate climate impact and is asking if there are ways to improve it.
1330559491318763520 2020-11-23 01:11:17 +0800 <shoutingboy> I think Jaroslav Pelikan once joked that people pay St. Anselm the highest compliment of all, they think “Cur Deus Homo” is in the Bible. #SubtweetyLikeASundayMorning
1330558478549536768 2020-11-23 01:07:16 +0800 <shoutingboy> @LadyDemosthenes @TheMiddleborne Okay, let me know if you want to talk about the “payment of a debt” thing this thread was originally about.
1330558088500244480 2020-11-23 01:05:43 +0800 <shoutingboy> @LadyDemosthenes @TheMiddleborne not seeing anything about “payment” or “debt” in either of those verses
1330557807993659399 2020-11-23 01:04:36 +0800 <shoutingboy> @TheMiddleborne @LadyDemosthenes We can’t really talk about what’s in the Bible if you won’t distinguish what’s in the Bible from what you are absitively sure is the meaning of what’s in the Bible.
1330557507060678658 2020-11-23 01:03:24 +0800 <shoutingboy> @LadyDemosthenes @TheMiddleborne ...are those animals “paying the debt” for my sins? Christ’s sacrifice stones because he his both God and man. Since a goat or a measure of wheat is neither God nor man, I don’t see how the wheat is going to pay any debt for me.
1330557031669923841 2020-11-23 01:01:31 +0800 <shoutingboy> @TheMiddleborne @LadyDemosthenes If you’re saying Jesus doesn’t have the authority to *forgive* sins, I think we need to go further back.
1330556707945074688 2020-11-23 01:00:14 +0800 <shoutingboy> @LadyDemosthenes @TheMiddleborne I’ll amend my original tweet, having looked more at the article—there’s a lot in the article that I disagree with and that I’m pretty sure CSL would disagree with.  But the tweet is accurate (and comports with what CSL wrote.)
1330556380684554240 2020-11-23 00:58:56 +0800 <shoutingboy> @TheMiddleborne @LadyDemosthenes Did you even notice that two thirds of your tweet is directly from the Bible, but the last third is an explanation you added that isn’t in the Bible?
1330555827078369281 2020-11-23 00:56:44 +0800 <shoutingboy> @LadyDemosthenes @TheMiddleborne And yes, “he is the propitiation for our sins” is in the Bible. But how does his death appease God? That’s the whole question here! “His death appeases God because it makes a payment we owe” is, again, an *explanation* of the propitiation but that explanation isn’t in the text.
1330555192790577152 2020-11-23 00:54:13 +0800 <shoutingboy> @LadyDemosthenes @TheMiddleborne I’m not saying it’s *hard* to get the “he paid our debt” idea from what’s in the Bible, but it isn’t explicitly in those verses. If Jesus can *cancel* our debt, he can do it because our debt is *owed to him* (which it is!)...
1330554441875918848 2020-11-23 00:51:14 +0800 <shoutingboy> @DSiPaint @CSLewisDaily A little earlier in that chapter...  https://t.co/da4Rnvat5n
1330553773400289280 2020-11-23 00:48:34 +0800 <shoutingboy> @LadyDemosthenes @TheMiddleborne (relevant quotes from “Mere Christianity”)  https://t.co/XkXz3SVvoB
1330552811239600129 2020-11-23 00:44:45 +0800 <shoutingboy> @LadyDemosthenes @TheMiddleborne From a quick glance, the tweet and article do seem to match what CSL wrote. “Jesus died for our sins” is in the Bible; “Jesus’s death paid the debt we owe God” is a traditional explanation of that first bit, but it is not itself in the Bible and isn’t required Christian doctrine.

1329144850055196672 2020-11-19 03:30:01 +0800 <shoutingboy> @meh130 @FreeBeacon @ReverendWarnock @alanagoodman So far all I've seen of this sermon is a 15-second clip. For all I know he *does* talk about other categories ("You can't serve your father, your wife, your country, if you serve Jesus"). ...do you have a link to the full sermon?
1329143070458212352 2020-11-19 03:22:56 +0800 <shoutingboy> Gotta figure that if the whole sermon came across that way, someone would be sharing a transcript. Gotta figure that since nobody is sharing a transcript, the whole sermon isn't as bad as they're painting it.
1329143069606756354 2020-11-19 03:22:56 +0800 <shoutingboy> Was this such a sermon? Or was he using "two masters" as a cheap shot--"you disagree with me about foreign policy because you're an idolator who worships the military"? I can't tell from a 15 second clip. Share the text of the sermon and I can have an opinion.
1329143068654592000 2020-11-19 03:22:56 +0800 <shoutingboy> ...second, from lots of things I've seen that he said, I can easily believe that he's anti-military, anti-America, anti-Israel, all kinds of things. But I've heard plenty of sermons saying "this *good* thing you value? You can't make it your master."
1329143067777982464 2020-11-19 03:22:56 +0800 <shoutingboy> 2. The fallback claim I'm seeing now is "By singling out the military for a '2-masters' sermon, Warnock is showing that he's anti-military." So... First, that's a *huge* climbdown from "he said Christians can't be in the military...
1329143066989453312 2020-11-19 03:22:56 +0800 <shoutingboy> Are we still talking about Warnock? Okay, I'll expand on what I said yesterday.  1. The initial claim was that Warnock said you can't serve God *and serve in the military*. That's what the Beacon's tweet said. From all I've seen, that claim is a lie. He said no such thing.

1328841556023939073 2020-11-18 07:24:50 +0800 <shoutingboy> @EsotericCD @_Almaqah @noonanjo ...I haven't seen any broader context. I could easily see a preacher offering a list of "here are good things, things you like and should like, *that you are not allowed to serve* because your only master is God."
1328841310556491776 2020-11-18 07:23:51 +0800 <shoutingboy> @EsotericCD @_Almaqah @noonanjo I read him as saying you can't have the military be the center of your life, just as you can't have money be the center of your life--and that's standard Christian doctrine.  If I could watch the whole sermon I could judge whether he's singling the military out...
1328840875716136961 2020-11-18 07:22:08 +0800 <shoutingboy> @AlanWessman @guypbenson If you read the article, it's pretty clear that Warnock is extending Matt 6:24 -- that just as you can't serve God and also serve money, so you can't also serve God and also serve the military, *in the sense of having the military be your lord*.
1328840050151288834 2020-11-18 07:18:51 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Super70sSports I dunno, I prefer 'em a little more mature.  https://t.co/hx22Y1oWjj
1328833143277711361 2020-11-18 06:51:24 +0800 <shoutingboy> @19_mo_86 I’m sorry if I sounded condescending, it’s just tricky having a conversation in writing with someone who evidently has limited reading skills. 😕 I think if you look, you will find that he never said that you can’t serve God and serve *in* the military.
1328832108085743624 2020-11-18 06:47:17 +0800 <shoutingboy> @19_mo_86 I recognize Christian doctrine is pretty shocking the first time you run across it. Actually, if you pay attention, it keeps being shocking.
1328831678433742848 2020-11-18 06:45:35 +0800 <shoutingboy> @19_mo_86 Yes, thank you for sharing the quote! He doesn’t say you can’t serve God *and serve in the military*. He says that—just as you can’t serve God and also serve money, so, in the same way, you can’t serve God and also serve the military. Standard Christian doctrine!
1328831076601450496 2020-11-18 06:43:11 +0800 <shoutingboy> @19_mo_86 @FreeBeacon @Julio_Rosas11 @ReverendWarnock @alanagoodman And he never said a Christian can’t serve in the military.

You can only have one master, so if God is your master, nothing else can be—and therefore, if you are serving anything besides God, then you aren’t serving God.
1328827381700673537 2020-11-18 06:28:30 +0800 <shoutingboy> @FreeBeacon Christian preacher preaches Christian doctrine, shock
1328827083284307968 2020-11-18 06:27:19 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Mr_Honkitude @_Almaqah @FreeBeacon @BrentScher @ReverendWarnock @alanagoodman And Warnock never said that you can't be in the military. Read his actual quote (helpfully provided in the article), don't just read the inaccurate headline or tweet.
1328826447608250368 2020-11-18 06:24:48 +0800 <shoutingboy> @19_mo_86 @FreeBeacon @Julio_Rosas11 @ReverendWarnock @alanagoodman Warnock is reading Matthew 6:24 and he's reading it accurately. You can't have two masters. If God is your master, *nothing else can be your master*--not money, not love, not the military.
1328825404304420865 2020-11-18 06:20:39 +0800 <shoutingboy> I don't like it when people twist a Christian's words out of context to make it sound like Christian doctrine is a bar to public service. I don't like it when lefties do it to ACB, and I don't like it any better when righties do it to Warnock.
1328825402953850883 2020-11-18 06:20:39 +0800 <shoutingboy> Don't know if I want to boost the signal on this misleading article, but... Warnock does *not* say you can't serve God *while serving in the military*, the tweet is a lie.  He says you can't serve God *and serve the military*, per Matthew 6:24. (And he's right.)
1328824796268793857 2020-11-18 06:18:14 +0800 <shoutingboy> @FreeBeacon @ReverendWarnock @alanagoodman I don't like it when the left says "This person says Christian doctrine like he believes it, that's a disqualifier". And I don't like it any better when folks on the right do that--and that's what's going on here.
1328824620326158336 2020-11-18 06:17:32 +0800 <shoutingboy> @FreeBeacon @ReverendWarnock @alanagoodman Not a Warnock fan but it's clear he's making the very traditional Christian point that you can't have two *masters*. He doesn't say you can't serve *in* the military, he says you can't *serve the military*, just as you can't serve mammon (he makes the analogy explicit).

1328142028157329408 2020-11-16 09:05:09 +0800 <shoutingboy> @shawnbaugh @BenjiBacker Should Hillary have contested the 2016 election using these same means? Stipulated that she had the legal right to do so. Should she have forced a delay in the transition by filing no-hope lawsuits and calling the election a fraud?  She had as much basis to do so as DJT does.

1328097262564589569 2020-11-16 06:07:16 +0800 <shoutingboy> I had never seriously considered the question “when is it appropriate for a synagogue to have a swastika behind the bima”, but I guess one appropriate answer is “when the Jews took the building from some Nazi’s punk ass”. 🙌
1328095572595654656 2020-11-16 06:00:33 +0800 <shoutingboy> @xthread The first few tweets I could take as @ComfortablySmug-style “you libs can have my red Starbucks cup when you pry it from my cold dead hands” trolling. I’ve done that myself!  But I’m seeing tweets that really look like “Look (((they’re))) stealing Baby Jesus” in earnest.
1328093785222311936 2020-11-16 05:53:27 +0800 <shoutingboy> I mean, I love a good troll as much as the next guy. If you’re just trolling, have fun! But there’s no way to watch that clip in good faith and think Jake Tapper is talking about canceling Christmas.
1328093783360106498 2020-11-16 05:53:27 +0800 <shoutingboy> Feel free to dunk on him if you like, but if you watch the clip, it’s clear Tapper is saying “It’s not going to be possible to get back to a normal (pre-COVID) life by Christmas, we’re looking at spring or summer“.

1326986217599062017 2020-11-13 04:32:23 +0800 <shoutingboy> @FormerlyCBM I think there’s a good political case to make for “GOP shifts towards populism/working-class on some key issues” (immigration? trade? entitlements?)  But Trumpism-writ-large has been tried by a bunch of candidates over the last four years and it’s only worked for The Donald.

1326945485806993408 2020-11-13 01:50:31 +0800 <shoutingboy> @BryanONolan We don’t know anything until a vaccine actually gets approved. But I’m pretty sure I read that if it’s Pfizer’s, the first few million doses could be ready by EOY. (They’re already starting manufacturing, I believe.)  Of course, since we need ~ 600 million doses just for the US…

1326940909863227392 2020-11-13 01:32:20 +0800 <shoutingboy> @BryanONolan If a vaccine has started to roll out by New Year’s, I think 2021 will feel a lot different even if we’re still distancing for a few more months.
1326940522372423681 2020-11-13 01:30:48 +0800 <shoutingboy> @SirajAHashmi Would it be an inappropriate tribute to name it Ruth Gator Binsburg 🙌
1326940131303976960 2020-11-13 01:29:15 +0800 <shoutingboy> If you tell me a particular government action is inappropriate, I’ll take you a lot more seriously if I see some indication that you’re aware of just how fucking bad the situation is. End of rant.
1326940130276335616 2020-11-13 01:29:15 +0800 <shoutingboy> … a lot of people will say “guess we need all those government rules, because look at what people will do if we let them.”  And yes, I’m talking about large family gatherings during a deadly respiratory pandemic that’s spreading out of control across the country.
1326940129055764480 2020-11-13 01:29:14 +0800 <shoutingboy> (And yes, part of the argument has also been “people have the right to make stupid decisions too“, but that’s always been a harder sell…)   So when you go around saying “this government policy is bad, and by golly i’m going to do a stupid thing just to show them“…
1326940128187617280 2020-11-13 01:29:14 +0800 <shoutingboy> Just a thought: a big part of the conservative/libertarian argument has always been, “we don’t need the government to tell people what to do, they can make smart decisions for themselves.“

1326262727614984192 2020-11-11 04:37:29 +0800 <shoutingboy> @RummaTumTums you’re supposed to start your recipe with a page or two about your summer in Tuscany
1326262558945280000 2020-11-11 04:36:49 +0800 <shoutingboy> @jessesingal All those times we let people get away with starting their recipes with 500 words about their big breakup second year at Rutgers, it was leading to this.
1326261381922893824 2020-11-11 04:32:08 +0800 <shoutingboy> @CopSiki @senatorshoshana Well, that’s because everyone who matters already knows about Senator Weissmann
1326254884581117952 2020-11-11 04:06:19 +0800 <shoutingboy> I mean, the job Biden’s taking over, I wouldn’t wish that on anyone 😰
1326251695643389953 2020-11-11 03:53:39 +0800 <shoutingboy> @moodyredhead @politicalmath It looks like that particular tweet is down. I don’t know whether Twitter took it down, or LincolnProject realized it was a risky fight.
1326231425759113216 2020-11-11 02:33:06 +0800 <shoutingboy> @politicalmath (I absolutely support the vet’s policies, because they need to stay safe while serving the public, and because I haven’t forgotten that there’s a deadly respiratory pandemic that doesn’t actually care about my politics.)
1326223885914710016 2020-11-11 02:03:09 +0800 <shoutingboy> @politicalmath I couldn't be with my dog when she died, because the vet only allowed one family member inside.  Glad they had a nice election party tho  https://t.co/QL5ym57CC8
1326223421559037952 2020-11-11 02:01:18 +0800 <shoutingboy> @politicalmath You can report a tweet for this. I did so--might as well see if Twitter will, in fact, follow its own rules.  (They probably will, it's not like anyone likes Project Lincoln all that much now that the election is over.)
1326222243609784320 2020-11-11 01:56:37 +0800 <shoutingboy> They have my sympathies, it's a rotten situation for them to be in, but, well, they just failed a big test. They deserve to lose.  (Still hope they win! But they don't deserve to.)

1326175633362186240 2020-11-10 22:51:24 +0800 <shoutingboy> Also, this travel falls under the “I didn’t mean *me*” provision of the quarantine order
1326174573679706112 2020-11-10 22:47:12 +0800 <shoutingboy> @RummaTumTums @FiveThirtyEight Because Nate wanted a really, really, really, really nice name, so he went with 69 × 5

1326045106911076353 2020-11-10 14:12:44 +0800 <shoutingboy> @bf_crane Always disappointed when a random person like that has me blocked and I search and it turns out I never interacted with them. I prefer the whole “oh yeah I said that hahaha they were right to block me” thing.

1326013841164050432 2020-11-10 12:08:30 +0800 <shoutingboy> @kimpossiblefact How come the donkey has hooves on its back feet but not its front feet  I mean  This makes no sense 😕

1325986853623799808 2020-11-10 10:21:16 +0800 <shoutingboy> @FormerlyCBM Playing to the base is a recipe for losing. But playing to the center, while a guy who your base loves tells them that you’re a no-good sellout who threw the election, is also a weak position.

If Dems had proposed eliminating the filibuster in 2017–or Republicans in 2010–it wouldn’t look like a power grab.

1325915565215506433 2020-11-10 05:37:59 +0800 <shoutingboy> @CheeseForEvery1 He can still run “Trump needs to be impeached” for another couple of months
1325912151790268416 2020-11-10 05:24:25 +0800 <shoutingboy> @politicalmath ...and worse yet, as we’ve been seeing with the protests, LOTS of people interpret that message as “whatever you want to do is safe, as long as you’re wearing a mask”.

1325835088970412032 2020-11-10 00:18:12 +0800 <shoutingboy> @RightWingWatch Joe Biden is NOT MY PRESIDENT and he WILL NOT BE MY PRESIDENT until LATE JANUARY and that is a FACT ☺️🙏
1325833621853278209 2020-11-10 00:12:22 +0800 <shoutingboy> @KekePalmer Rethink this.

1325831698165030912 2020-11-10 00:04:44 +0800 <shoutingboy> @_Peter_Cook Yes, I remember “They’re gonna put y’all back in chains”, and I’m not giving Biden a blank check. But like the man said, let’s give each other a chance.  It’ll be interesting seeing what tone he sets in the Georgia runoff.
1325831258920792064 2020-11-10 00:02:59 +0800 <shoutingboy> @_Peter_Cook ...i.e. he’s talking about *his* obligations to promote unity, not Republicans; and (c) For those reasons, I’ve been seeing lots of Democrats complain about his unity talk. He’s peeing on their campfire. And FWIW Biden was not one of the nastier Dem voices in the Trump era.
1325830718421782528 2020-11-10 00:00:50 +0800 <shoutingboy> @_Peter_Cook I’m willing to give Biden a fair chance to show he means it, because (a) His phrasing is carefully directed at both sides—“our opponents are not our enemies”—(b) He emphasizes that he’s going to be president of people who didn’t vote for him...

1325488111455936513 2020-11-09 01:19:26 +0800 <shoutingboy> @baseballcrank Given how frustrating this week was for everyone, I think there could actually be bipartisan support for meaningful national standards for voting? It’s something Biden and McConnell could do to show “we’re willing to work together”.
1325486555402657792 2020-11-09 01:13:15 +0800 <shoutingboy> @FormerlyCBM I’d honestly be surprised if he attends. I don’t think they’ll need to evict him from the White House but I just don’t see him sitting politely for Joe Biden’s speech.
1325486188900229120 2020-11-09 01:11:48 +0800 <shoutingboy> @JonahDispatch @JayCaruso I’m guessing in 1960, Republicans still had a big share of the African American vote, between “party of Lincoln” and southern Democrats backing Jim Crow.

1324828364213874688 2020-11-07 05:37:50 +0800 <shoutingboy> @GScottShand @bendreyfuss @michaelbd This is science-fiction in half a dozen different ways but I am still enjoying the mental image of Chuck Schumer‘s face when he finds out
1324825404314513409 2020-11-07 05:26:05 +0800 <shoutingboy> @bendreyfuss I think at this point we might be forced to confront the possibility that Susan Collins likes being a senator
1324817993809891328 2020-11-07 04:56:38 +0800 <shoutingboy> @YourMomSports @redsteeze @ProjectLincoln Alas, looks like they’re going to do their darndest to ride this grift through the Georgia runoff. Can’t blame them for trying, I guess.

1324817560311799809 2020-11-07 04:54:54 +0800 <shoutingboy> @ms_sharims @mattdpearce @byrdinator I won’t argue with “cowardly”. Not sure about irresponsible, actually, as Trump might be more likely to lash out if he feels more abandoned. Letting him think Congress is behind him, while they’re actually cutting ties, might be better...
1324811028673122305 2020-11-07 04:28:57 +0800 <shoutingboy> @mikehahn_ Ooh, don’t forget yard signs! 😀

1324803956942336000 2020-11-07 04:00:51 +0800 <shoutingboy> @mattdpearce @byrdinator I think in a lot of cases, it's a way for GOP officeholders to sound like they're supporting Trump without actually backing his claims.
1324789652109193216 2020-11-07 03:04:01 +0800 <shoutingboy> You heard it here first: If Ossoff loses, that means Donald Trump actually won the election. 😊

1324780179995074560 2020-11-07 02:26:22 +0800 <shoutingboy> @NihilisticGOP @senatemajldr They’re looking down at a GOP Senate and smiling ☺️  (What? Of course they’re Republicans now. Everyone in Heaven is.)
1324779615164850176 2020-11-07 02:24:08 +0800 <shoutingboy> @mattklewis That was also JFK’s mandate
1324777227234336768 2020-11-07 02:14:38 +0800 <shoutingboy> Do I think Biden will do this? Nah, but food for thought maybe? But if he does it he better do it soon. If Manchin decides to flip...   https://t.co/sjh8i8ImhB
1324777225934102528 2020-11-07 02:14:38 +0800 <shoutingboy> Risks: 1. Piss off an already angry irredentist left—but that’s a mixed bag, might give him a cheap Sista Souljah moment. 2. Lessen Dem enthusiasm in GA runoff, since they wouldn’t have a shot at taking the Senate—but it’s already a long shot.
1324777224671645696 2020-11-07 02:14:38 +0800 <shoutingboy> It maybe gets Biden some goodwill, especially from goo-goos like Romney/Collins/Murkowski he’s going to be need very soon. It’s almost entirely hypothetical, since Dems are unlikely to sweep Georgia next month.
1324777222536744960 2020-11-07 02:14:37 +0800 <shoutingboy> Speculation: Right now would be a great time for Biden to do what GWB did in 2000—say that if there’s a 50-50 Senate, GOP will share leadership. (Committees evenly split, and a tie vote in committee means it goes to the floor.)

1324755659775045632 2020-11-07 00:48:56 +0800 <shoutingboy> @IMAO_ Might be a reason to let Trump believe he still can win as long as possible

But the activists saying "abolish" (and then, more commonly, "defund")--and writing op-eds explaining that they meant what they were saying--were a problem for the politicians.  A big problem? I dunno. But a problem, in what turned out to be a tight election.

1324410833053523969 2020-11-06 01:58:43 +0800 <shoutingboy> @EggerDC I could certainly imagine the scenario where angry Trumpers stay home because they feel like the Dems stole the White House and the party sold them out.  But that's not how I'd bet. Really feels to me like both Georgia seats stay GOP.

She had way more money than she needed because out-of-state Collins haters were sending money to her instead of where it was needed. Same thing keeps happening in Kentucky.
1324404635625385985 2020-11-06 01:34:06 +0800 <shoutingboy> @justincbzz @Redistrict I should have been clearer—when I said Texas, I meant the fan money spent on Beto in 2018. Yes, given the polling, it made sense for Biden to make a play for Texas, if only to force Trump to defend it. But the money spent on Gideon in Maine could’ve been spent better elsewhere.
1324403695409192961 2020-11-06 01:30:21 +0800 <shoutingboy> @SeanTrende I’m betting the campaigns are working really hard to find approaches to polling that can give them *some* useful information so they aren’t flying blind. But the polling civilians care about—a straight answer to “who’s winning right now?”—might be impossible now.
1324402834020855810 2020-11-06 01:26:56 +0800 <shoutingboy> @justincbzz @Redistrict Arizona’s been on the razor’s edge for a few cycles now, spending to try to flip a seat there made sense. Kentucky and Texas... less so.

1323717303284850688 2020-11-04 04:02:53 +0800 <shoutingboy> @NathanWurtzel We should have a pretty good idea where we are by, oh, 4:20
1323716497756151809 2020-11-04 03:59:41 +0800 <shoutingboy> @and_furiouser @misfitpoise I think it’s very helpful to distinguish *excusing* someone from *forgiving* them. When you excuse someone, you say what they did wasn’t so bad. Forgiving someone includes recognizing that what they did was in fact bad. You don’t have to gaslight yourself into thinking otherwise.

1323692214917111809 2020-11-04 02:23:11 +0800 <shoutingboy> @fisherofmeh But, yes, Democrats probably would have objected to being  "red" (though that's the standard left-of-center color in much of the world), and Republicans had no reason to mind, so that probably made it easier.
1323691982179373056 2020-11-04 02:22:16 +0800 <shoutingboy> @fisherofmeh Honestly, I think it's mainly coincidence. The networks used to use different colors, and switch from cycle to cycle. But in 2000 they all used the current scheme, and because of the recount, we saw those red/blue maps for a month--and that cemented it.

1320965608972767234 2020-10-27 13:48:38 +0800 <shoutingboy> @SaintRPh Arguably that had already happened before the 17th amendment. The Lincoln-Douglas debates were before direct election of Senators. As I understand it, the whole point of the debates was, by then, people were voting for state legislators as a proxy for the Senate.

1319065786720268289 2020-10-22 07:59:25 +0800 <shoutingboy> @aelfred_D No opening act. First was Prince with an electric band. Then, to give him a bathroom break, a pianist and saxophonist played a few instrumental numbers (they did a tribute to Ray Charles, who'd just died). Then Prince with a solo acoustic set, then Prince with a funk band.

1319018870808608768 2020-10-22 04:52:59 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Jwjwag ...and again, the evidence seems to be, neither of the stories will make a difference to anyone. If either "Hunter/Ukraine" or "Trump/taxes" was enough to turn you from undecided to decided, it would have done so long ago.

1319005513900716032 2020-10-22 03:59:55 +0800 <shoutingboy> @CheeseForEvery1 @JonahDispatch It’s probably a feedback loop, too. People are more partisan, so they give directly to single-interest groups or primary challengers instead of the institutional party (because they’re more uncompromising), so the parties get even weaker.
1319002745706139648 2020-10-22 03:48:55 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Jwjwag @JonahDispatch I think the point is, if you were going to be bothered by either story—justly or unjustly!—then what you knew in July was more than enough to settle your vote, and the recent stories haven’t given any additional information that would change your mind.

AIUI, Biblical phrases like "Praise the Lord, all ye nations" ("...kol goyim"/"...omnes gentes") were understood as Israel saying it to all *other* nations, and, thus, "goyim" came to mean "non-Jews".
1318985898382426112 2020-10-22 02:41:58 +0800 <shoutingboy> @jaketapper @NathanWurtzel In Biblical Hebrew, "goy" means "nation", but AIUI in modern Hebrew it only means "non-Jew"--you'd only use "am"/"amim" for "nation(s)".

1318593437520678912 2020-10-21 00:42:28 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Popehat Given that witnesses said he aimed the camera *at his crotch*, it seems pretty clear that his goal was to video himself wanking during a business chat. The "accident" was that the video went to the chat instead of to its intended audience. So... still pretty bad!  https://t.co/R6SSaWNtl0
1318592890747023360 2020-10-21 00:40:18 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Popehat All the scenarios I can imagine hinge around his goal being "I am going to wank in front of my coworkers and they won't know it". I'm guessing his goal was "I will be sharing the video with [trusted perv-partner]" and he didn't intend it to go to the team chat.

1318377945203798016 2020-10-20 10:26:11 +0800 <shoutingboy> @MiguelAntNat I don’t follow OJ Simpson. He’s famous for football (which I don’t follow) and for murdering two people (which I think is bad). So there’s no real reason for me to follow him.  I follow Jake Tapper, though, he’s pretty awesome.
1318376308829679616 2020-10-20 10:19:40 +0800 <shoutingboy> @MiguelAntNat He is not guilty in the eyes of the law, I think we’re all agreed on this. The only sense in which he is “guilty” is that he murdered two people with a knife.

1317935419686756352 2020-10-19 05:07:44 +0800 <shoutingboy> @RhysRiddell @kittypurrzog I saw this TV show where a kid set up a cancer fundraiser for his dad and it worked really well, because his dad used it to launder the money he made from making meth, so, like, there’s an option
1317934910481444864 2020-10-19 05:05:43 +0800 <shoutingboy> @kittypurrzog Gonna make GoFundMe for “top surgery” and then use the money to get LASIK (hey, my eyes are up top)
1317906574120087552 2020-10-19 03:13:07 +0800 <shoutingboy> @yashar She is clearly urging an audience of 1930s movie gangsters to “86“ our president, and those are some of the most deadly people in cinematic history 😰

1317873933325012994 2020-10-19 01:03:25 +0800 <shoutingboy> @onlxn “Most presidential except maybe Abe Lincoln”—any politician might make a joke like that. “...except Abe Lincoln, *when he wore the hat*”? That shows a long and proud Borscht Belt pedigree.
1317873543019864064 2020-10-19 01:01:52 +0800 <shoutingboy> @onlxn People tend to confuse “I don’t find him charming” with “he’s not charming”. (Conservatives made the same error about Obama and Bill Clinton.) He was a successful TV entertainer for years, that’s a tough business! He has skills!

1317867115370610688 2020-10-19 00:36:19 +0800 <shoutingboy> @klcmurphy @AGHamilton29 Maybe there wasn’t a spike in DC—where they’d had a huge surge in April/May, and (like most regions that got hit hard at the beginning) had a drop-off after that first peak.  But look at a nationwide chart, and if you wouldn’t mind, drop a line here where the BLM protests start.  https://t.co/WhxNcCfvGW

1317847231400062981 2020-10-18 23:17:19 +0800 <shoutingboy> @klcmurphy @AGHamilton29 That article is from July 6 (just as the summer spike was starting to get going) and it’s a lot less definitive than you imply. Really just “we haven’t found a connection but who knows”.  https://t.co/uZ8hBmuPuT
1317846726460411911 2020-10-18 23:15:18 +0800 <shoutingboy> @AGHamilton29 And those articles saying “no rise in cases” are weasel-worded. Yes, there were huge protests in June, and yes, cases went up nationwide in June, but no, we haven’t *linked* the cases to the protests! (After making zero effort to find any such links.)

The challenge is to the ACA as modified by the GOP Congress, which is very significant—by zeroing out the mandate’s penalty, Congress made the mandate clearly severable. Zero chance ACB votes to strike down the entire law.

1315117506080587776 2020-10-11 10:30:21 +0800 <shoutingboy> If America settles into “whoever takes the WH and Senate seats four more justices and re-tries the last decade”, it’ll have some entertainment value, anyway.
1315117504256040961 2020-10-11 10:30:21 +0800 <shoutingboy> Considering how many progressive wins have come from the Supreme Court over the last 50 years—wins that would have taken a lot longer to get through the legislature, if ever—not sure they reeeeally want to blow up its legitimacy once and for all. But I can live with it.

1315108670414352385 2020-10-11 09:55:15 +0800 <shoutingboy> (If your definition of “trad“ is “thinks Mary was a virgin and abortion is bad“, I think Ms. Bruenig would qualify, but that’s not what the term tends to mean in Catholic circles)
1315108047446962177 2020-10-11 09:52:46 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Post_Market Right now, every store needs an answer to the question, “Why come here instead of Amazon?“  There are lots of good answers to that question! But if a retailer can’t come up with that answer, it’s going to be in trouble.

1314951023065063424 2020-10-10 23:28:49 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Noahpinion On the first one, it’s the other way around—everyone *who looks at her* turns to stone. (In the myth Perseus fights her by looking at the reflection in his shield, which protects him.)  So clearly Medusa chopped off his head from behind, because she fights like a girl. 😠

But it's a fact that there isn't such a taboo now, so I can't, for example, say "he's wearing a Che shirt, he must be evil" the way I could if I saw someone wearing a swastika. For whatever reason, it's just different.

1314261048485003264 2020-10-09 01:47:06 +0800 <shoutingboy> @neontaster ironically the question will be moot if Donald Trump resigns like Jen Rubin keeps telling him to
1314260144436330497 2020-10-09 01:43:30 +0800 <shoutingboy> @JonahDispatch @scottlincicome If I heard a line like "you may not know I'm a senior" from, say, Nancy Pelosi or Mitch McConnell, I'd assume it was self-deprecating humor. But (intentional) self-deprecation really isn't Trump's thing.
1314257394822639617 2020-10-09 01:32:35 +0800 <shoutingboy> @JonahDispatch very few seniors look as good as he does in those Ben Garrison cartoons

1313976000007426054 2020-10-08 06:54:25 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Goodtweet_man But there’s such interesting tension in some of the characters’ attributes. For example, Lisa is moral *and* smart *and* liberal *and* vegetarian 🤔

1313945178118393856 2020-10-08 04:51:57 +0800 <shoutingboy> @WhereDidUSAGo2 Kinda figure if Senator McFeeley couldn’t make the case in 2017 it’s not likely to be a winner now, but sure, the odds have got to be better than if you stick with “witnesses caught her being all Catholic and shit”

1313940006843551745 2020-10-08 04:31:24 +0800 <shoutingboy> @PBNiles @DouthatNYT Well, the traditional assumption is that demons are intelligent beings, with powers we don’t understand, *who are trying to hide from us*. So... how would you devise an experiment?

1313906064950083584 2020-10-08 02:16:31 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Goodtweet_man (I mean, likely the people reporting you are doing it in bad faith, but when Twitter looks at the post, they just see a message from you saying “I’m contemplating suicide“ and not the context that it’s a message you got from someone.)
1313905793809301504 2020-10-08 02:15:27 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Goodtweet_man When you share those prayer requests, it’s probably a good idea to add a caption specifically saying “sharing a prayer request“. Your followers know what’s going on, but out of context, those tweets look like they’re coming from you. That’s probably what happened here.

1313536825483436034 2020-10-07 01:49:18 +0800 <shoutingboy> @brunchhater @Goodtweet_man As humans, I don’t think we can ever know with certainty that someone has either (a) truly heard the Gospel, or (b) genuinely rejected it. But certainly, if it looks like someone has done those things, praying for them is an excellent idea.
1313535085228879872 2020-10-07 01:42:23 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Goodtweet_man “God, please bless these people and show them your mercy” is usually a safe option, especially since God is likely to be able to come up with a good way to do it even if I don’t offer him specific pointers

1313273553404358656 2020-10-06 08:23:09 +0800 <shoutingboy> @CheeseForEvery1 @perpetuities And while I might disagree on the prudential judgment, there’s nothing inherently non-conservative that I can see about their position.
1313273187476541440 2020-10-06 08:21:41 +0800 <shoutingboy> @CheeseForEvery1 @perpetuities I think they’ve both said that filling the seat now, under these circumstances, would be bad for the country — but I don’t think they’ve ever said that a Justice Barrett would be worse on the court than RBG, or a Biden appointee.
1313271684196048896 2020-10-06 08:15:43 +0800 <shoutingboy> @perpetuities @CheeseForEvery1 There’s only one definition of “conservative” that includes Donald Trump and excludes Jonah Goldberg, and that’s defining “conservative” to mean “someone who supports Donald Trump”.

1313132239840923649 2020-10-05 23:01:37 +0800 <shoutingboy> @jbarro Though when we see photos of mass protests—sometimes with elected officials, frequently crowded close together—we hear plenty of people saying “Shut up, they’re all wearing masks.”  I guess what I’m saying is, I hate everyone

So court packing might be Good, Actually, if it changes how we see the Court.

1312773231326060544 2020-10-04 23:15:03 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Goodtweet_man And to be fair, if the church hierarchy is saying “there is no longer a good-faith argument that those circumstances apply in the developed world”, and that was not what it said before, I think it’s reasonable to say “the church’s teaching has changed”—though not its doctrine.
1312772946868334592 2020-10-04 23:13:55 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Goodtweet_man My understanding (IANAC) is that the doctrine is “the death penalty is only licit under certain narrow circumstances” and the argument is over whether those circumstances apply now?

1312112781353598977 2020-10-03 03:30:39 +0800 <shoutingboy> so this tweet about the Jerry Falwell Jr story held up a little too well 😰

1312062843861123072 2020-10-03 00:12:13 +0800 <shoutingboy> Donald Trump’s dying wish was that Judge Barrett be confirmed to the Supreme Court 😢❤️

1312062247900835842 2020-10-03 00:09:51 +0800 <shoutingboy> @MMBenNC @brad_polumbo @Neoavatara If a British commentator said at the time that it was a “serious moment for the country” I would have said, well, yeah

1312057487118352384 2020-10-02 23:50:56 +0800 <shoutingboy> It didn’t bother me when Trump joked about McCain maybe (maybe!) being in hell, and it doesn’t bother me when people joke about Trump having COVID ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

1312045853872279554 2020-10-02 23:04:42 +0800 <shoutingboy> @CalebJHull The column was published before Trump announced he had COVID—the premise was “once Trump leaves office he won’t be such a huge psychic premise”. Presumably they removed the tweet because it *looked like* it was fantasizing about his death, but it wasn’t.  https://t.co/lxJDPkH3c4

1312038470458634242 2020-10-02 22:35:22 +0800 <shoutingboy> @rodinrodin7 @Goodtweet_man The president having 3+% chance of death—and a somewhat higher chance of a serious illness, with potential lasting consequences—is, in fact, a really big deal.

1311497823334985728 2020-10-01 10:47:02 +0800 <shoutingboy> @SirajAHashmi I really would rather people not be fired over dumb tweets – even racist dumb tweets — so I think the lesson here is, some people should be giving you their phones a lot sooner

1311489513546379265 2020-10-01 10:14:00 +0800 <shoutingboy> @davidharsanyi @TonyBrunoShow Trump has no trouble telling us exactly how he feels about Nancy Pelosi or Joe Biden or The Squad or Rosie O’Donnell. When it comes to white supremacists, he has a lot more trouble expressing himself ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

1311419646004740096 2020-10-01 05:36:23 +0800 <shoutingboy> @asymmetricinfo @yardsbkc I think Hillary was the Mule—there’s no way Dr. Seldon could anticipate a figure powerful enough to utterly control one party and still a bad enough candidate that she could lose to Donald frickin’ Trump.
1311418908809654272 2020-10-01 05:33:27 +0800 <shoutingboy> @asymmetricinfo Vice President Ryan totally rocked last night’s debate, it was just embarrassing

1311393630804865024 2020-10-01 03:53:00 +0800 <shoutingboy> @FormerlyCBM A moderator who doesn't seem fair *might* work better for Trump. He's not going to do well regardless, but "they were out to get me" is an easier sell if it isn't Chris Wallace.
1311370361540231169 2020-10-01 02:20:32 +0800 <shoutingboy> @ffa0213 @jbarro Well, the Republicans managed to nominate the one person Hillary *could* beat. And even there she didn't quiiiite manage it.
1311370108237787136 2020-10-01 02:19:32 +0800 <shoutingboy> @jbarro But both sides have this weird interest in pretending Hillary wasn't horrible. Trump needs it to look like he accomplished something really hard, and various Dem groups are deeply invested in Hillary Is Awesome And Only Bigots Deny This.
1311368260349079552 2020-10-01 02:12:11 +0800 <shoutingboy> @neontaster @mattyglesias I feel like, if you come out of the debate knowing both candidates better, the debate did its job!  (I didn't watch the debate, I kinda feel like I know both of them well enough already 🙃)

1309926751905050624 2020-09-27 02:44:09 +0800 <shoutingboy> In my (Orthodox) church, when we take communion the priest addresses us as “the servant of God”/“the handmaiden of God”. The term “handmaiden” is always understood to mean “...of God”, not chas v’shalom “...of your husband” or any other man.
1309926751129145344 2020-09-27 02:44:09 +0800 <shoutingboy> Thought: Secular and protestant liberals have very little awareness of what “handmaid” means to Catholics and others with a strong tradition of Marian devotion (waves hellenicly ☦️). To them it has to sound like creepy trolling from That Book. #EcceAncillaDomini

1309551583449853957 2020-09-26 01:53:22 +0800 <shoutingboy> @AnthonyWMarcum But THIS smells like hot garbage. It seems to be saying that if the Senate doesn’t approve a Justice, it has thereby “waived” its role and consent isn’t needed. So... in what sense is their consent needed? That’s straight-up unconstitutional.  https://t.co/BB01poHPYS
1309550854664454144 2020-09-26 01:50:28 +0800 <shoutingboy> @AnthonyWMarcum It seems to me that it’s redefining the office of SCOTUS Justice to mean: Hearing appeals for a while (~18 years), then being “senior”. Since the law doesn’t affect justices already on the bench, might that be constitutional?

1309547067623182336 2020-09-26 01:35:25 +0800 <shoutingboy> @AndyGrewal @djsziff It seems to me that if you’re only a citizen because you were naturalized—whether or not you lost citizenship before—you wouldn’t count as “natural born”. But I suppose it’s up to the Senate/SCOTUS to make the final call.
1309546673715122178 2020-09-26 01:33:51 +0800 <shoutingboy> @AndyGrewal Looks like Markle hasn’t renounced her US citizenship (and may not even be a British citizen yet?). In any event, she’s definite a duchess and princess. Not sure if that disqualifies her from being president ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1309545499653894151 2020-09-26 01:29:11 +0800 <shoutingboy> @AndyGrewal She still is a princess and a duchess, though she isn’t on the “active royal” roster—basically, being royal is no longer her day job.  Also, didn’t she give up her US citizenship?

1309371921406935046 2020-09-25 13:59:27 +0800 <shoutingboy> @VerumVulnero1 That is, the proposed law doesn’t remove justices. Instead, it specifies just what future justices’ duties are—18 years of hearing appeals, followed by as much senior-statusing as they want. So it might be constitutional?
1309371527104614402 2020-09-25 13:57:53 +0800 <shoutingboy> @VerumVulnero1 The argument seems to be that it wouldn’t require an amendment because (a) it wouldn’t affect current justices, and (b) future justices wouldn’t lose their pay or titles—they’d be confirmed to “18 years active SCOTUS followed by lifetime of senior justice status”. So... maybe?

1308914434031706112 2020-09-24 07:41:34 +0800 <shoutingboy> @emzanotti I think Trump's instinct whenever he doesn't have an answer ready is to hedge. "We'll have to see what happens. A lot of people think so. That's something we're looking into."  Sometimes it gets him into trouble.

1307419197396246528 2020-09-20 04:40:01 +0800 <shoutingboy> @yashar I read it as “We can start hearings on Trump’s nominee now, but if he loses, we shouldn’t vote on them—we should wait for Biden. If Trump wins, we can move ahead on a vote for Trump’s nom in the lame duck session.”

1307201712168419328 2020-09-19 14:15:49 +0800 <shoutingboy> @stinson Thinking this may be why McConnell was so tastelessly quick with his “YES by golly we will vote on President Trump’s nominee right away” statement.

Not Catholic myself, but AIUI, it was *always* official Catholic teaching that suicide-when-insane doesn't necessarily mean you're damned.

Was Hitler saved in the end? If we ever actually need to know, we’ll find out.

1306614047928918016 2020-09-17 23:20:39 +0800 <shoutingboy> @wash_cloth @wannalisten @ebruenig AIUI it would depend on his state of mind when he died—if he was sufficiently crazy he wouldn’t have been capable of mortal sin.  I believe the official teaching (IANAC) is, *if* Hitler repented, he will eventually go to Heaven, though he might be in Purgatory for quite a while.
1306468517328244737 2020-09-17 13:42:22 +0800 <shoutingboy> @HauntedTrading @yashar That’s an interesting question!

1305713655929958405 2020-09-15 11:42:49 +0800 <shoutingboy> @doyouhaveanarmy Someone shares their struggles and your reaction is to make fun of them for having suffered? That’s not great.
1305705929996812291 2020-09-15 11:12:07 +0800 <shoutingboy> @MzCorningstone Oh hey! Good news! I found a longer video and it turns out the protestor climbed onto a car that was barely moving, so it turns out what happened after that point was their own stupid fault ☺️👍
1305700200082583553 2020-09-15 10:49:21 +0800 <shoutingboy> @MzCorningstone why was she standing in front of a moving car in the first place 🤔

1305630285908701184 2020-09-15 06:11:32 +0800 <shoutingboy> So the Al Franken truthers may not be quite as vehement as Michael Jackson fans, but they’re still pretty impressive. Got a lot of people in my mentions with charts and diagrams proving that there was a second groper on the grassy knoll.

I mean, other than a denial from a sex pig who’s been accused by eight other women?

1305593657718788096 2020-09-15 03:45:59 +0800 <shoutingboy> @and_furiouser I think a good rule of thumb is, if someone says something that seems stupid or crazy to you, and you can find a way to construe it otherwise, do so unless they’re well established as stupid or crazy.  (“I really disagree with her politics” isn’t sufficient to establish that.)
1305583959879725057 2020-09-15 03:07:27 +0800 <shoutingboy> @IMAO_ Saturday Night Live do a spoof of the debate and they should see if they can get Alec Baldwin to put on a Trump wig, that’s always hilarious ☺️
1305583608803946496 2020-09-15 03:06:03 +0800 <shoutingboy> @SerenaVW7 @alfranken @KasieDC Look, Republicans are stuck with their sex pig in high office. Your sex pig resigned in disgrace and was replaced by a competent legislator of the same party who isn’t a sex pig. That’s a win! Enjoy it! Don’t undermine it by bringing your sex pig back into public life! ☺️

1304886661289967617 2020-09-13 04:56:38 +0800 <shoutingboy> @BecketAdams okay I admit that’s technically my “head canon”

1304799995673993217 2020-09-12 23:12:15 +0800 <shoutingboy> @LPDonovan @daveweigel I think it’s a real possibility, but if we’re saying “polls could be way less accurate than we expect because 2020”, we have to allow that the polls might be undercounting Biden’s support as easily as Trump’s.
1304798496176762881 2020-09-12 23:06:18 +0800 <shoutingboy> @M_Stone969 @gabrielmalor That’s what I was thinking too. Eating in restaurants might correlate with lots of tiny risks that pollsters wouldn’t ask about—or with bigger risks (like not wearing masks in general) that people might lie to pollsters about.

But if I just need to scan a few pages, my phone does just fine—I have a cheap app that crops photos of pages, straightens them, adjusts perspective, and exports as PDF. All I need 90%+ of the time.

1304620376907890689 2020-09-12 11:18:31 +0800 <shoutingboy> @JReedCooley I’d be interested in seeing how many of the audience reviews came from people who actually *saw the movie*, which is traditionally considered a requirement for reviewing a movie

1304594724083302401 2020-09-12 09:36:35 +0800 <shoutingboy> @BamaExpat @Goodtweet_man It also needs to be given to enough actual *good* people (Gandhis and MLKs and the like) that the dictators will value it.  I think the ideal proportion is: 1/3 actual heroes for peace; 1/3 monsters who are bribed into being decent; 1/3 randos who symbolize an important cause…
1304594052965376003 2020-09-12 09:33:55 +0800 <shoutingboy> @jbarro @AsteadWesley I believe it was Herodotus who said “count no man attractive until you have seen his rear end” 🤔
1304590339693395968 2020-09-12 09:19:09 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Holden114 Yes, I’ve read writers I respect who disagree with each other about the movie. And I certainly can believe scenarios like “filmmaker tried to critique sexualization of children and the effort fell flat/backfired”.  I think a bit of charity is called for here.
1304589608408084480 2020-09-12 09:16:15 +0800 <shoutingboy> @ebruenig that’s how they build a strong immune system, and also how they learn to fight off raccoons
1304589388026789888 2020-09-12 09:15:22 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Holden114 And according to lots of reviewers— I haven’t seen the movie myself — that’s how you’re supposed to feel about the dance in CUTIES.  I don’t have trouble believing this, there are a lot of movies I love that choose to portray repulsive things.
1304588727650381824 2020-09-12 09:12:45 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Holden114 I am not aroused by either the image from TAXI DRIVER or the clip from CUTIES. In fact, I find both kind of repulsive. 🤔

1304489109407240193 2020-09-12 02:36:54 +0800 <shoutingboy> I'd just like to leave you with the very wise thoughts of a great American statesman.   https://t.co/3BmQnVpnye
1304489108731904000 2020-09-12 02:36:54 +0800 <shoutingboy> If watch a disgusting dance scene--which, by all indications, the filmmaker *intended to provoke disgust*, and which provokes disgust in the in-film audience--and say "yes but pervs will like it"... well, lots of pervs enjoy the murders in GODFATHER. Pervs don't get a veto.
1304489107834380289 2020-09-12 02:36:54 +0800 <shoutingboy> As @Halalcoholism observed, if your position is "spreading scenes like *this* promotes pedophilia *regardless of context*", and you say it *while you're spreading those scenes*... 🤔  Oh, you say, you're spreading those scenes because you *oppose* pedophilia? Hm!
1304489106920022018 2020-09-12 02:36:53 +0800 <shoutingboy> ...this is a judgment call, and calls for charity. Saying "this movie shouldn't have been made" is one thing. Saying "people who disagree with me are pro-pedophilia" is something quite fucking else, and I've seen a lot of people go there.
1304489106043367424 2020-09-12 02:36:53 +0800 <shoutingboy> More thoughts on That Film: It's legit to say "given the material, I have a very high bar on whether things like that should be made, and I've seen enough to decide this hasn't cleared the bar." BUT...
1304480919672090624 2020-09-12 02:04:21 +0800 <shoutingboy> @ClemondNFlinch @SonnyBunch If our standard is “no art allowed if pervs can enjoy it the wrong way”, that rules out a *lot*. For starters, every movie or tv show from GODFATHER to SOPRANOS to BREAKING BAD where the sick people enjoy all the killin’s.
1304471894997962752 2020-09-12 01:28:30 +0800 <shoutingboy> @SirajAHashmi I know it hurt but I’m sure @hard2ern didn’t really mean it 😰❤️
1304471395699580929 2020-09-12 01:26:31 +0800 <shoutingboy> @katrosenfield I feel like there’s not much for me to go on there. It makes sense that the university would have a procedure to follow when a professor is accused of bias, and it has to follow the procedure even if the accusation looks like garbage (as this one does, to me at least).
1304467296480501760 2020-09-12 01:10:13 +0800 <shoutingboy> @BridgetPhetasy Well, there was LiveJournal, but it wasn’t the same ☺️

1304311937560313856 2020-09-11 14:52:53 +0800 <shoutingboy> Thank you for coming to my TED Talk
1304311936532717569 2020-09-11 14:52:53 +0800 <shoutingboy> And you really don’t know enough to say that people who disagree with you are “pro-pedo”.
1304311935073054722 2020-09-11 14:52:52 +0800 <shoutingboy> Oh and if you’ve seen two minutes of the movie—two very disturbing minutes! Granted!—and read some screenshot of a bullet list of things that sound disturbing, yeah, I don’t think you know enough to judge either.
1304311934057984000 2020-09-11 14:52:52 +0800 <shoutingboy> So I’ve seen enough of That Movie that I feel like I don’t want to watch it, and that means I haven’t seen enough to know whether That Movie is actually bad, so I’m not going to make a judgement on that, and I’m actually okay with that
1304310515187867648 2020-09-11 14:47:14 +0800 <shoutingboy> @moebiusz I’m going to pretend that I don’t understand the reference and not assume that you’re just randomly insinuating that he’s a oedophile and we’ll both feel better about this. ☺️

If a thousand people can stretch their arms out and touch a stranger it’s a really really bad thing. Masks make it measurably less bad but they don’t make it good.

1304228405668229120 2020-09-11 09:20:57 +0800 <shoutingboy> It’s a fair point! If your argument is “sharing sexualized images of children is pro-pedo, full stop, context doesn’t matter”, and you emphasize it by... sharing sexualized images of children... 🤨

1304109016574910464 2020-09-11 01:26:33 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Montco_Nast_Tom @politicalmath My point is, simply, that there’s lots of blame to go around. And not all of it lands on one side.  Prepared to have the discussion about “where do we go from here”, which is different from the discussion about “who has been horrible”.

1304097361526833152 2020-09-11 00:40:14 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Montco_Nast_Tom @politicalmath Lots of public health officials and politicians who “believe in science” suddenly decided in early June that crowds of any size and any density are perfectly safe as long as a lot of the people are wearing masks. Strangely none of them were saying that in May.
1304097011642245121 2020-09-11 00:38:51 +0800 <shoutingboy> @Montco_Nast_Tom @politicalmath If we “[hold] people accountable for knowingly and purposefully lying, over and over again, to the public about a pandemic” people are going to be very surprised about who gets tangled in *that* net, too.

Remember in the Sandman comic where Batman and Clark Kent show up in the dreaming?  “Superman“ is a costume Clark Kent puts on to fight crime. “Bruce Wayne“ is a costume Batman puts on as a cover story.
1302832417397301249 2020-09-07 12:53:48 +0800 <shoutingboy> @hyacinthgrrl @Laura_PH “Bruce” exists only insofar as he’s useful to Batman. If Batman decides it’s helpful for Bruce to be good in bed, you’re all set.

1302808365555302400 2020-09-07 11:18:14 +0800 <shoutingboy> I fancy I’ve actually been fairly consistent in my position, which is that this is a deadly respiratory pandemic that isn’t much interested in your politics except insofar as it makes you shout, which it likes

Vote for Edwin Edwards because the opponent is David Duke, that kind of thing.  In my case, I’d vote for a literal Communist against a literal Nazi.

Also, I’ll cut a LOT more leeway to a person who says “as a Christian, I feel I must” than I do to someone who says “If *you* are a Christian, you must...”  Pastors have more authority to do the latter, of course, but they’ll be held to a stricter accounting.

1301185628990701568 2020-09-02 23:50:03 +0800 <shoutingboy> @IMAO_ ...if a young, previously-healthy person dies of COVID-19, the certificate should still say something like “CAUSE OF DEATH: Acute respiratory distress syndrome brought on by pneumonia caused by COVID-19”. Not just “CAUSE OF DEATH: COVID-19”.  Info here:   https://t.co/29X4SqeDge
1301185290669760512 2020-09-02 23:48:42 +0800 <shoutingboy> @IMAO_ It’s worse than that. The 6% is “death certificates that don’t list anything other than COVID”—which really just means “the certificate was filled out by someone inexperienced or exhausted”...

He clearly shot people who were chasing him, we don’t have a clear picture of why they were chasing him.  So there’s evidence to support “self defense” but it isn’t conclusive. Agreed?
