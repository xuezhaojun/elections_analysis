1344023520599281674 2020-12-30 04:52:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> In my County 26 dairy farms that have generations in business Gone. Nothing closed not one day, big corporations are pricing them out to the distributor. The distributor is still charging full price to the store.
1344022563253583873 2020-12-30 04:48:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @BertholdSr There are a bunch of 2 million acre commercial farms sprung up in Texas

1344019454603259906 2020-12-30 04:36:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @BertholdSr A month a go I could buy prime grade ribeye at 8.99 which killed the Ranchers, now it's 17.99. It's been going on during the whole covid scam
1344018592598286338 2020-12-30 04:32:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @BertholdSr Yes, they did it to me in my rose business. I couldn't sell my 250,000. Crop this yr for more than 100,000. At that price I lose 25,000 with no profit so I wrote off the whole crop.
1344017705289068544 2020-12-30 04:29:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Amrch1 Texas has more dairy farms in one County than the whole state of PA. They're trying to put them out of business so we can all pay 6. A gallon. These business destroyers love Democrat presidents. They get rich off inflation.

1344013771933687810 2020-12-30 04:13:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> In my area milk is 2.29 a gallon, guess why? Big govt funded commercial farms are putting all the family businesses out. It's happening in many industries, supplies and materials are fluctuating to destroy small business

1344007373988519938 2020-12-30 03:48:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's happening in Texas as well, and we're open. The big commercial farms are strangling the little guys out using covid as cover. Many industries are doing it under covid darkness. Destroying small business!

1343945853560627200 2020-12-29 23:43:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> You're not doing your part if you're not calling the GOP politicians. It doesn't matter if you think it works or not. If millions of people were calling me I would be concerned. They have to be overwhelmed by voters now before Jan 6 th

1343933194769477632 2020-12-29 22:53:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We know democrats cheated our election, the world knows. Joe Biden nor stinky Harris should be allowed to stain the grass of our Whitehouse  with their lying dog faced pony soldier feet.
1343932065121767425 2020-12-29 22:49:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If Biden became president, he would be the first in my lifetime to have committed crimes in other countries. He's currently on trial in other countries for bribing officials to benefit his son Hunter. Hunter payed Joe, the world knows
1343931268640206848 2020-12-29 22:45:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Biden is talking about the next deadly epidemic. He's the next deadly epidemic if allowed near the Whitehouse.
1343930827621736457 2020-12-29 22:44:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The only people killing grandma are Democrat govenors and mayors with their mandates

1343769594520084484 2020-12-29 12:03:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Alot of Americans are not allowed to work and alot of kids are not in school. You can't visit your mom in the nursing home. Your only allowed to shop in certain stores. Some folks have no food, congress gave itself a raise.

1343737876387913728 2020-12-29 09:57:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's sad when you realize the kind of folks we have in our govt. They don't seem to really care about the people hurting, they're living in mansions eating like royalty on our money. Potus has been the only one to put Americans first.

You would be surprised how many of these scumbags never show up. Many thought to be conservatives vote with the liberals regularly. I used to like Dan Crenshaw

How many people have had their livelihood taken away by our govt? How many can't see a dying family member because govt doesn't allow?

1342226692505559040 2020-12-25 05:52:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We're just customers to the govt, we buy their bs and send them unaccountable sums of revenue. We have no idea were all that money goes, remember the Pentagon bought plunger for 138. Each yrs ago. 2 for the plunger the rest is payoffs
1342225454254714880 2020-12-25 05:47:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I wouldn't be surprised if Pelosi and McConnell have drinks together regularly. I had a friend in the secret service who guarded Clinton. He told me they all get together and are buddies. They've been doing it along time, Potus is in their way.
1342224153970167815 2020-12-25 05:42:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Amber81276971 Merry Christmas to you and your family
1342223506512220163 2020-12-25 05:39:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We can't fix this govt, we have to replace it and that isn't going to be easy.
1342221293865861123 2020-12-25 05:31:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Why aren't Republicans defending Potus? We know why, because they're in on it. Govt doesn't represent the people, It represent corporations and special interest groups who funnel money back to them.
1342220387032117248 2020-12-25 05:27:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When I was 6 my dad took me to a big time wrestling match, good guy vs badguy. After it was over he took me to a diner to eat, The good guy and bad guy were eating and laughing together. I never forgot that, same in politics
1342219390603964418 2020-12-25 05:23:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> What a year, Who knew the whole govt would join together to facilitate the fraud  of an election. It lets you know for certain they're one team and we ain't on that team. Potus interfered with their theft of our money, Traitors are in office.
1342203539834208265 2020-12-25 04:20:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @DavidAFrench You disgrace our nation by listing military on your bio.

1341421816422785027 2020-12-23 00:34:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Many people are saying we need to keep voting republican or surrender control to the dems. I say our Republicans betraying Potus already surrendered,they just want the old country club back.
1341421093484171268 2020-12-23 00:31:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> As a sole proprietor in the rose business I saved 7300. On the tax cut. Their was enough  extra for me to buy needed material for repairs.
1341412669484638212 2020-12-22 23:57:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @GOP Conservatives will not vote republican again. Your party is dead to Patriots, you lost at least 60 mil voters. You betrayed Potus and America,  you screwed us for the last time. Vote against Rinos
1341411620078141449 2020-12-22 23:53:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @HawleyMO We don't want it, vote no

1341191059104264192 2020-12-22 09:17:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> From what I can tell on here,  just a small amount of states are totally shut down. I can't accept any person being told they can't work, where they can shop. Putting times for business to close, making people that are healthy wear a mask
1341189916810752000 2020-12-22 09:12:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My one daughter lives in PA with a moron for a govenor. She has 5 children and had a store, she lost a 13 yr business during these shutdowns.  It was a small town main st store that made enough to live. Politicians destroyed it
1341188927672246272 2020-12-22 09:08:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I forget we get new folks in our group everyday. My part of Texas has never had a mandate or any shutdowns.

They ordered a 6 million dollar order from me, 6 mths later they had paid me about 10,000. They paid every two weeks off what sold. Consignment is how they work, or sell shelf at ungodly price.

That's how I lost a little start up factory in TX. They brought Chinese by to see how it works. Yr later they were making my product.

1340110223231619075 2020-12-19 09:42:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I certainly thought todays shows were comedic. Isn't it insulting that they think performances on TV( most trusted news source) would cause people to rush in to be  a part  of it. Probably will offer stimulus to get things going.
1340108957780742145 2020-12-19 09:37:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @cherri_pitman We will give you a stimulus check

1339746492127559680 2020-12-18 09:37:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @dprinter9 It just makes sense
1339746218541535233 2020-12-18 09:36:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have friends in Florida living under rigid mandates. Every red state I would assume has a dem controlled County imposing mandates. Texas has many big dem cities shutdown and small dem counties. Higher fear in those places
1339745267571146753 2020-12-18 09:32:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I do things a little different since covid, I eat out more and buy more from family owned business. They never shut down but covid woke me up to quit buying from the big boys anymore. It might cost a little more. I'm investing in America
1339742680436367365 2020-12-18 09:22:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Every year from now on when the flu comes people will be wearing masks. If you cough or sneeze people will get paranoid. The common cold will make you a danger to others. This is what our children are learning from this. Masks are now accessories to many
1339740607892381701 2020-12-18 09:13:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @knightofmaltaus In this case how you would normally celebrate or not for christmas
1339739228872331266 2020-12-18 09:08:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My County in Texas quit reporting anything on covid in August. Other counties that are doing the daily fear factor people are more afraid. I haven't heard the word covid spoken in mths. Other counties it's the only topic. Fear spreads
1339738171454722050 2020-12-18 09:04:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> 👇That's the answer

1339735128705294338 2020-12-18 08:52:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If you live in area that's not dem controlled the covid fear is very low. If you live in a red state but are in a dem area the fear is much higher. True?
1339733600929984513 2020-12-18 08:45:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @FarRightGirl @rvelsa18 Yes

1339698834029621250 2020-12-18 06:27:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @speechteacher19 I hate driving there, I lived there in Los Colinas in the 80s. I used to live that city.
1339698471700492295 2020-12-18 06:26:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @altournas Yep, that's what I'm leading up to
1339696507793125376 2020-12-18 06:18:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When you look at our nations voting maps a small portion of the country is dem. If you take the big cities out of the voting. It would be tough for dems to win anything.  We know now they've been cheating to win, America is conservative
1339695251255123970 2020-12-18 06:13:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @itskate1492 There is a sign near me that says EL Paso 927 miles lol

1339687253103263745 2020-12-18 05:41:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Louisiana is a state run by Democrat govenors. If you look at their voting map Potus won the whole state except the big cities. Fortunately Louisiana doesn't have many big cities and Potus won easily.
1339685754704949255 2020-12-18 05:35:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> America is divided by cities, if you look at the map, the big cities voted dems. More chance for fraud, black votes for dems are high in big cities. Everywhere else in America is pretty much conservatives.There is no way for a dem to win without fraud
1339684690769416193 2020-12-18 05:31:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I was going thru the PA voting numbers by county, Trump won 90 % of the counties.
1339679480659456000 2020-12-18 05:10:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I live in an area where it's easier to find a four leaf clover than a Democrat. What's it like for my brothers and sisters who live in Democrat controlled cities and states. Are any of you being harassed for being a patriot?
1339618352239677442 2020-12-18 01:07:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We can never unite as a country again, Democrats have destroyed morality, decency and respect for others. I don't want to live with people like them.
1339615696955826176 2020-12-18 00:57:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @JenNova5 I always say gods will be done, not mine. No man knows the will of the father except his son, my lord and savior Jesus Christ. He didn't give us the spirit of fear and has emboldened us to speak out against wrong.
1339614055548514304 2020-12-18 00:50:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> many uninformed hateful people joined together to create this Democrat party. Godless and caring only for themselves, perverting our children. Murdering thru abortion,selling baby organs . Traitors , all of them, God save America.
1339608823670185988 2020-12-18 00:30:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> America was built on law and order, Why is it always the democrats breaking our laws?

1339389997351391233 2020-12-17 10:00:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Remember two weeks and we're over nine months now with no end in sight. The dems are stating at least three more months if Biden has his say. 2 wks=9 mths, 3 mths = 54 mths? No more!
1339386974407421953 2020-12-17 09:48:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm sick of politicians shouting orders to Americans, they don't have that authority. If they do it's our duty to disobey and call them out. We need a good old eviction of these politicians before it's to late. Two weeks won't work again.
1339385864607199235 2020-12-17 09:44:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Two weeks shut up wear a mask. Line up at Walmart it's safe there as long as you get home by 10. Bodies everywhere, shut your business down stay home. No visitors allowed, folks must die alone, no funeral except George Floyd. No Masks
1339384390510669824 2020-12-17 09:38:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's us against them, Them being the corrupt govt officials complicit in this voter fraud. Dems and Rinos need to be held accountable for their Treason. We are getting hosed by these worthless pieces of commie crap.

1339351641569550342 2020-12-17 07:28:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Politicians talking about election fraud and admitting they know it happened. Will fix it after this so it doesn't happen again. That's like me seeing my car stolen and doing nothing, next time I will lock it in the garage.
1339348184431276034 2020-12-17 07:14:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrats singing that old song about unifying the country. We aren't interested in unifying, I don't want anything but my vote to count, audit the votes.
1339346415961710599 2020-12-17 07:07:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Politicians talking fraud was committed  in the election? Why aren't they arresting people? Are they just going to let it slide? They say they will fix it so it don't happen again. We want it fixed now, when did we decide to give up?
1339343332527509504 2020-12-17 06:55:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Everyone in the world knows the election was stolen. Our politicians are talking about putting laws in effect so it don't happen again. I say fix this election by auditing all votes and arresting those who committed fraud.

1339034452899622915 2020-12-16 10:27:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They're treating us like prisoners in many cities and states. I suffer when my fellow Americans are being imprisoned from working and living life all for a political agenda. Governors and mayors living it up shouting at you to wear your mask.
1339033218700488706 2020-12-16 10:22:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Sometimes I feel responsible for not doing more to stop it when it started with the Two weeks over nine months ago. They did it to steal an election , The media conspired with them to divide the nation with TDS. They're not stopping we know that to be true
1339032005821026305 2020-12-16 10:18:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @bigred895 God bless
1339031931758010368 2020-12-16 10:17:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> You can't go anywhere, watch , read ,talk to anyone without covid coming up, even if it's patriots complaining about it or angry about it. It consumes all media including commercial and ads telling you to wear a mask. Many children will be struggling
1339029878386159616 2020-12-16 10:09:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm not ashamed to say the truth
1339023228354891778 2020-12-16 09:43:10 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm trying to get in the Christmas Spirit, it's hard to have fun when you think about fellow Americans living under these brutal restrictions.These democrats that are destroying businesses acting all high and mighty while their citizens struggle. TRUTH
1339012842037587969 2020-12-16 09:01:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Amen
1339000339492724737 2020-12-16 08:12:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @I_love_our_USA I like those laws and count on it
1338998713516175360 2020-12-16 08:05:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I was watching a national officers  meeting, they're saying carjacking is now a regular activity. His explanation of carjacking was vivid, a violent theft and robbery of a victim in a vehicle. Mostly a gun is used and groups attack the vehicle violently
1338995821140996097 2020-12-16 07:54:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @mahjonggirl That's what I wanted to post lol

1338991979099791362 2020-12-16 07:38:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm not giving up on America or potus till he tells us something, I'm not as aware as others about the legal issues. But I know American patriots don't give up, we have many challenges going on with election fraud and shutdowns. I'm waiting on potus
1338990109006450688 2020-12-16 07:31:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @kansasauthor How ever it turns out,  gods will be done, right?
1338985504130408451 2020-12-16 07:13:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We're deep in the crap right now with plandemic ,vaccine, Traitors in our govt, courts all compromised, patriots numbers on here has fell off drastically. It seems important to be on here to get real time info. This is our staging ground
1338978376091119616 2020-12-16 06:44:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> What a poor excuse for an American
1338975700053848064 2020-12-16 06:34:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I just watched a video of Biden walking to a podium, if he wasn't such a piece of crap I would've felt sorry for him.He could barely get one foot in front of the other, looked lost and confused. I wonder what they juice him with for brief cognitive moments?
1338961559641591811 2020-12-16 05:38:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Q_ntmGrmr Yes it is
1338961289951973381 2020-12-16 05:37:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @xxstate I saw that in a Seth Rogan movie lol
1338960962385293312 2020-12-16 05:35:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I can't wait to get my vaccine, it will be a glorious day knowing that he'll hath frozen over.
1338960426567135233 2020-12-16 05:33:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The whole truth
1338959745630212096 2020-12-16 05:30:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Is anybody going to do anything, McConnell and Biden are practically dating.
1338959244150845440 2020-12-16 05:28:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Morons
1338955033094844417 2020-12-16 05:12:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @GailJaz Lol , it's true , when it sinks in about all the freedoms lost and ordering people to do this and you can't do this. If I lived in one of those areas I would either be dead or in jail.  Praying for our Lord to intervene , or give me the wisdom of what to do
1338953519643176968 2020-12-16 05:06:10 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @ReadMoreBible I agree, I feel like it's not meant for me. To be honest I don't think it is, I'm okay with that but its an evil divisive dems move.
1338952410144907265 2020-12-16 05:01:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> That makes me so mad, California, Michigan, New York etc purposely destroy their states and peoples lives, we the taxpayers will have to cover their incompetence. They did it all to disrupt our election process, Traitors!
1338950227550760962 2020-12-16 04:53:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Thetime78251936 They're such amazing plants, so unique , I love the string of dolphins. People buy them, she raises them to sell.
1338948687666548736 2020-12-16 04:46:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> How's this happening in America? Who's all involved and what's the endgame. When and how do we stop it.
1338947962991423488 2020-12-16 04:44:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Spending most of today helping my daughter get all her plants in. 30 tonight 26 tommorow night, she has thousands of succulents and other plants outside. Trying to stay busy and refresh my brain, our country is being destroyed from within
1338946383357894656 2020-12-16 04:37:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Kelly48722576 I wish it was here, I'm wearing a jacket, I haven't worn a jacket for cold weather for 30 yrs
1338926891579924480 2020-12-16 03:20:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This 4 day Texas cold snap can leave anytime, I know it's cold up north, I grew up in PA. We ain't used to this type of weather, 27 degrees👀. My horses and angus love it, rabbits are happy, chickens not so happy. I can't drag the dog out  https://t.co/QythA4N1yf
1338904380637114370 2020-12-16 01:50:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @enlightnup I get it
1338892408675766274 2020-12-16 01:03:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Let me rephrase my question, I have been busy the past couple days. Does anyone have any new info on the election? Preferably good news.
1338891735632670721 2020-12-16 01:00:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @LoxlyM I love scripture, I wasn't being insulting.  My brain read it like a fortune cookie lol
1338890795500363776 2020-12-16 00:56:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @TrumpIs86806962 I'm looking for anything new
1338889732005240834 2020-12-16 00:52:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @LoxlyM That sounded like a fortune cookie lol
1338889064859267073 2020-12-16 00:50:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Patriot1447 Yes
1338888817470803969 2020-12-16 00:49:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @TX_Justus I have been busy the last few days and haven't heard anything going on
1338882765358583818 2020-12-16 00:25:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Is there any good news about the election?
1338723073747513346 2020-12-15 13:50:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all of you   patriotic folks. My daughter and I are going to watch some videos on sandbass, they will be running soon. Jesus Saves completely it's easy to do, Goodnight and pray for Potus and America. No masks
1338717563816185856 2020-12-15 13:28:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @MsMnqMnt Thanks
1338714372768665600 2020-12-15 13:15:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @BertholdSr That's a mighty fine beard for sure, I have had one since bootcamp, never shaved it off. Only wise men grow beards lol
1338712827297738753 2020-12-15 13:09:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @BertholdSr Heavy congested area?
1338712052693676033 2020-12-15 13:06:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless those who have suffered due to this flu, lives were lost leaving family and friends grieving. Businesses destroyed, jobs lost ,suicides , addictions,mental illness, loss of freedom. All except the first is done by our govt to us
1338710138774040578 2020-12-15 12:59:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I always heard people died from the flu but I never thought anything about it because they didn't talk about it. The plain Jane flu kills  tens of thousands every year. Every now and then we get a stronger flu and more deaths. You can't hide from a flu
1338707869714231296 2020-12-15 12:50:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @BertholdSr Sorry for your loss, God bless his family and friends. The first person to die in my county was a 40 yr friend,   he was 94 and had emphysema then got covid
1338702550267293697 2020-12-15 12:28:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It won't be long that  they will have brainwashed the sheep that we're the virus. Their already saying it in their posts, it's picking up steam. We will have politicians and sheep telling us how to live
1338701317947224064 2020-12-15 12:24:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> You have to sit back and think about it, in nine months the amount of changes its crazy. Folks are just waiting for it to end to get back to normal. It's not gonna end on it's own, we just have to get the resolve to say no more and end it
1338700017037692928 2020-12-15 12:18:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They will just keep rolling out new pandemics to keep us under control. What's the future? Wake up put on your mask, go to assigned job, stand in line for issued food. Go home, that will be the only place you don't need a mask, stay home.
1338698817038901249 2020-12-15 12:14:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> 👇👇solid points all
1338698580161417217 2020-12-15 12:13:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We're not included, we don't fit the new world they envision.
1338698293212311555 2020-12-15 12:11:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This is exactly what they've accomplished. They've already got in going fast forward their not gonna stop till they destroy everything. So they can build back the way they want it without freedom, just obedience
1338694270136541185 2020-12-15 11:56:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Our children are growing up afraid  of living a normal life. They want that, I'm not willing to let them do it. It has to end now, not tommorow, it's already became the new normal to fearful people.
1338693486623723522 2020-12-15 11:52:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I despise the politicians destroying businesses and ordering adults around like we're kids. They're hoping people die to further the agenda, I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't sacrifice the folks in them nursing homes
1338692706151895040 2020-12-15 11:49:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They're claiming victory over the flu attributing it to us wearing toilet paper on our face. You know what that means, it's gonna be all the time. These power hungry politicians aren't gonna stop on their own.
1338691749590478849 2020-12-15 11:45:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The longer they get away with this shutdown crap the harder it's gonna be to stop. We really messed up on the two week thing nine months ago. Now their talking till 2022 then what? We can't keep going along with it
1338690221794275328 2020-12-15 11:39:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They're only getting away with it because people are not standing up and saying no more
1338689915480137729 2020-12-15 11:38:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They're going to keep going till everyone says no. We aren't children, this telling us what to do crap is bs. We need to tell these people a big No Thanks Adolph

1338625935617220614 2020-12-15 07:24:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We've learned sadly that a lot of politicians we used to respect have betrayed America. Their are still people of honor in govt, just not enough of them. We need a new party and dump these Rinos. I only vote for some because of Potus.

1338623127635496961 2020-12-15 07:13:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> A lot of folks like myself live under no mandates. That causes me to fight harder, I have a daughter and 5 grandkids in PA, I'm fighting for them to be free and all Americans. There is a reason we have no Antifa or other groups, we're all armed
1338621252236402704 2020-12-15 07:05:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Louie Gohmert is my congressman and a friend, I have known him a long time. He was a judge in a city near me and was a neighbor yrs ago. So far he hasn't let us down, I'm counting on him to stay the course.

1338614449943539717 2020-12-15 06:38:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm a 68 yr old man, I work 7 days a week. I survived cancer and I'm in a remission on a immune disease. I am a farmer / rancher. I'm a believer in Jesus Christ as my savior, I'm a friend to all. I enjoy people, no politician is telling me what I can do.
1338612326241546240 2020-12-15 06:30:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @LDecker619 @Matthew_4_Trump Me either, next time for me will get me blocked permanently.But we know
1338611852792786948 2020-12-15 06:28:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @wigwal13 Sorry for you my friend, God Bless. You need to drag your govenor out of office
1338611328651554820 2020-12-15 06:26:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @kansasauthor Even tho the science clearly proves masks don't work?
1338611085142876167 2020-12-15 06:25:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @KM3692 I would do it no matter were I lived. I promise you
1338610649035763712 2020-12-15 06:23:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Shadowbanned66 I just go in and keep going, I have had 4 mgrs at once on me. I just ignore them and buy something, go pay and leave. Others see you doing it and they will to, I have seen it happen
1338610070289076225 2020-12-15 06:21:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @MsMnqMnt That's what we need mass disobedience
1338609275908841473 2020-12-15 06:18:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have been trying to get arrested or fined for not complying. It would be a badge of honor, hasn't happened. I keep hearing you go there they will arrest you, I go and nothing. It's like your parents telling you to be home at 8, I ain't no kid.
1338607955537752067 2020-12-15 06:13:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @frenchivory Yep
1338607011085365250 2020-12-15 06:09:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @NancyCoats57 I have had zero shutdowns or mask mandates. Everything has been open normal, I have been to the theater, buffets and a concert. I travel to places mandated to show others to disobey
1338606447207329794 2020-12-15 06:07:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have never been under a mask mandate, zero business closed. Buffets open, cooks no masks, full capacity. I'm driving to places that have been nazied and disobeying so others can see. I make sure I'm noticed, I want to be challenged, it's fun.
1338605079620882432 2020-12-15 06:01:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @tegalude64 @Matthew_4_Trump Congrats, keep it up
1338604690867621890 2020-12-15 06:00:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter and I just got back from driving 80 miles to pick up a starter. We stopped at a chain grocery store, guy at the door said you need a mask. I said no thanks and we kept going, he yelled don't you care about others. I said no they're wearing masks
1338603327202996225 2020-12-15 05:54:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This crap ain't going away unless we don't go along with it anymore. They're not going to do anything, we're many. No violence necessary to end the mandates, just plain old simple not obeying. I drive to other areas just to disobey.
1338601618904936448 2020-12-15 05:47:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> All traitors
1338601344798765058 2020-12-15 05:46:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Nope, they need to be evicted
1338543944980946946 2020-12-15 01:58:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Television and social media alongside corrupt politicians created this whole scam.
1338540443089465345 2020-12-15 01:44:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> That's American and it's a spark. Demand your mayor open your town, go find him and tell him open up
1338534900664774659 2020-12-15 01:22:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If I was living in Los Angeles I would be outside the mayors house telling him to get out of our house. He lives in the voters house, evict him.
1338529861175009281 2020-12-15 01:02:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Dr Gates and his expert wife are wanting a couple more yrs of masks after you take the vaccine. The vaccine for the flu that has over a 99% survivability. The flu that cured all other deaths. Why would I do that?
1338528999300063260 2020-12-15 00:59:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Do you think the vaccine for medical professionals is the same as everyone elses
1338501989878132737 2020-12-14 23:11:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @KTinSB1 Ate to much, that's the problem with a buffet. It cost 30. I keep thinking I gotta get my thirty dollars worth. Lol
1338501148639162369 2020-12-14 23:08:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Do you think they will give candy out to those who get the vaccine? In dem cities the lines will be long to get the vaccine. Remember months ago Biden mentioned giving black folks the vaccine first. My neighbor wants me to testify he's white. Lol
1338499595211563016 2020-12-14 23:02:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @vania_kay I would've liked to have seen it
1338494941136363527 2020-12-14 22:43:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @vania_kay Crap, any on the ground?
1338359305469353984 2020-12-14 13:44:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We have to get urgent about not complying now, not sneaking in but defying the mandates. I drive to places shut down and don't wear a mask, others will join in. That's how it ends and we stop the control. Pray for America
1338358462120677377 2020-12-14 13:41:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all you amazing Patriots. I got to get some heaters in my hen house. Jesus Saves completely, it's easy to do. Thanks for sharing time, my daughter and I are going to heat up the chickens. Goodnight and God Bless
1338357123626004484 2020-12-14 13:36:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We've seen it other countries
1338339177017069568 2020-12-14 12:24:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have got to go check my critters, it's 40 degrees, supposed to get down to 37 tonight. My chickens will be going crazy
1338303448475951104 2020-12-14 10:03:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They're just getting started, end it now, just don't do it. Many will follow quickly, it will spread like a wildfire. Be the spark
1338302809008201729 2020-12-14 10:00:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter and I are going to one of them sushi joints, be back later. We would get more accomplished if folks got out in the streets and let them know how you feel. God Bless America
1338301981799178241 2020-12-14 09:57:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @maucrews @YouTube Thanks, now I'm gonna watch that movie tommorow night
1338300491823013895 2020-12-14 09:51:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @MarciaMar1 Texas
1338299335528902657 2020-12-14 09:46:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @maucrews @YouTube Love that movie
1338297356165537799 2020-12-14 09:38:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When the govenor ordered a two week mask charade here I got mad. Drove directly to the county judges office, when I arrived there was over 3000 mad people there. Crowd grew fast, never had a mask mandate or business close
1338296241294340098 2020-12-14 09:34:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I would like to see tar and feathering come back. Sounds like good family fun, keeps politicians honest as well
1338295132324585473 2020-12-14 09:29:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Phones, computers, social media made us lazy. Not that long ago if a politician was corrupt, folks went directly to that politicians office in huge crowds yelling for them to quit. Much faster than signing recalls
1338290593072631809 2020-12-14 09:11:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @jenny_treece I would go
1338289825976299520 2020-12-14 09:08:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Why don't the folks signing these recalls on these govenors just go to their homes and tell them to get out? A million people yelling at me to move out would work.

1338278652946092033 2020-12-14 08:24:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I remember an actor along time ago saying, From my cold dead hands. Kind relevant today isn't it?
1338272076436738052 2020-12-14 07:58:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @NTruths33ker We really are
1338267964504739847 2020-12-14 07:42:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @jenny_treece Yes my daughter has a boutique, she follows fashion designers for ideas.
1338258020636237825 2020-12-14 07:02:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Say her name lol
1338256260660137992 2020-12-14 06:55:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Coming February 2021 sculptured designer face shields.  Each one custom designed in time for valentines day  https://t.co/S5ODMDCnUD
1338250297811083268 2020-12-14 06:31:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Remember when Biden said a black man invented the light bulb. Other than senility why would he say that. Democrats make a living calling everyone a racist as they promote division by skin color or belief and gender. Now it's genders
1338248527542169602 2020-12-14 06:24:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The democrats indoctrinated us into identity politics using racism. Every time Biden speaks to black Americans he points out achievements of blacks. The way of stating it should be bill Johnson invented this. Why do we say black Americans, how bout Americans.
1338233007270924294 2020-12-14 05:23:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> All this stuff going on is confusing to most folks. Americans used to trust their govt on issues like covid. That trust is what made it easy for msm to help dictate mandates. Now they expect us to trust them on a vaccine
1338230945992896515 2020-12-14 05:14:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The people in Hong Kong would love to live in America with Potus in chg. Democrat voters want free stuff and ribbons for being able to tie their shoes. Democrats believe govt should control society. So does China
1338230018254761986 2020-12-14 05:11:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Why are people all over the world who live in oppression protesting for Trump. Our govt allowed and facilitated the theft of the election of the president of the most powerful nation in the world?
1338228208731365379 2020-12-14 05:04:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1>  https://t.co/hCVk9aXb8D

1338193799999336449 2020-12-14 02:47:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @westyrj @hopecrolius Agree
1338190104091897857 2020-12-14 02:32:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @hopecrolius Yes, mine included
1338185229727621122 2020-12-14 02:13:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @SamuelMohr4 I hope not
1338184511276855296 2020-12-14 02:10:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Native Texans are a different breed of folks, their families have lived on the land for generations. Many give the federal govt no consideration. If you told one of them a lefty offered more money for land but was refused the sale. They'd just nod.
1338178870663655425 2020-12-14 01:47:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter handmade and painted over 500 pairs of Christmas earrings. Mikey and Minnie mouse, Santa all sold out. This is what's left, we're giving these away in the shop today  https://t.co/WU8sshrJMx
1338177429018439688 2020-12-14 01:42:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @BertholdSr We all know him, he's a Texas true blood. Honor is still a thing here, I buy on a handshake
1338175272596672515 2020-12-14 01:33:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @MsMnqMnt Used to, she got threatened on July 4 th over selling flag earrings, all flags matter crap. We had a looney track us down and make threats. Which is why I'm here daily
1338171761167360000 2020-12-14 01:19:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @BrettEngle2 One can discriminate secretly
1338171437778161665 2020-12-14 01:18:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> After the scotus turn down on Texas, in hours meeting were being scheduled, people are talking about preparations fast for future events. Many new clubs forming, groups of folks making coalitions. People setting up reload shops at home
1338170089615613957 2020-12-14 01:13:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Roxyann08372839 @MtMama1776 I been subscribed to them for a yr, I love their info. Very reliable stuff
1338169086342275075 2020-12-14 01:09:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @footsbalutus I know that of course
1338168752639258624 2020-12-14 01:07:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @PeopleSpoken @Matthew_4_Trump Yes
1338168271946838017 2020-12-14 01:05:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughters shop is a boutique, most customers are women. They're all talking about  they carry and prepared to defend. I have learned the ladies are ready to go, and they're spreading word to keep dems out.
1338166845346619394 2020-12-14 01:00:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The Ranchers meeting last week was all about making sure no ones land gets sold to an unknown. When you're sitting in a room full of men with cowboy hats and all are carrying, it's a serious meeting.
1338165300915802116 2020-12-14 00:54:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We're at a point where conservatives are going to have to join together to help each other and possibly protect each other. We've heard their rhetoric, it's threatening, they say we need reeducated. They consider us expendable, we're in the way of progress
1338163551349911560 2020-12-14 00:47:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> One of my friends had his farm for sale, a California developer offered him 13 mil for it. Been in his family 180 yrs, he sold it to a local conservative for 4 mil. He has family buried their, he didn't want no commies walking on them lol
1338162038376427525 2020-12-14 00:41:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My area thankfully has put in a big effort to not sell homes to libtards escaping blue states. The feeling is if you sell to libs you're out of business. I like that, I don't want a bunch of deviants moving in my area.
1338160646362456064 2020-12-14 00:35:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @1doemontomery Yes
1338160432167661573 2020-12-14 00:34:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm at my daughters shop, a lot of folks ordered hats for their dogs for Christmas. She's making them and modeling them on her dog. Lol  https://t.co/PbNe1cF7nn
1338157375920992257 2020-12-14 00:22:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @VBCall16 It's a hideous comedy

1338155874297196546 2020-12-14 00:16:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @LindaK5165 Every night they take some down, last night they wouldn't let me post anything. I tweet over a hundred a day, I tweeted boo, they took that down lol
1338155385119776770 2020-12-14 00:14:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @VBCall16 All
1338132214484246530 2020-12-13 22:42:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Last night over 25 of my tweets never got seen. As soon as I tweeted them they were gone.
1338131792113643522 2020-12-13 22:40:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Racist whites is msm topic today, they mean conservatives. That's us, same old division  https://t.co/C6Yr7edorl
1337998500345368576 2020-12-13 13:51:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The facts, show them the truth over and over
1337997908294111239 2020-12-13 13:48:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The mayor in Portland and New York city, PA Gov all protested with looters and people were getting hurt.
1337997175842856960 2020-12-13 13:46:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all you wonderful Patriots. I'm tired tonight to much car riding. My daughter and I are gonna watch pureflix. Jesus Saves completely,it's easy to do. Pray for Potus and America, Goodnight Patriots. No mask
1337995063369011206 2020-12-13 13:37:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @MoanyKat I agree, fortunately my part of Texas didn't do any mandates or closures. We're  still 100%, I can drive 100 miles to Dallas and its libtard central full of transient lefties. Lining up already anticipating a vaccine, giddy as can be lol
1337993793749078017 2020-12-13 13:32:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @_JustWriting I posted at least 20 tonight they took down. Not very friendly are they, it happens to me every night. I used to make over a hundred everyday. They won't let me anymore, certain subjects they just take them off immediately.
1337982625294802944 2020-12-13 12:48:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @frenchivory That's why I go fishing every night
1337980039015620609 2020-12-13 12:37:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Truth, if it would've been a legitimate election it would've been over by 10:30 on election night. We're still counting, we should be auditing votes so that all legal votes get counted. They're challenging seats they lost in Congress right now.
1337978939277533184 2020-12-13 12:33:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Agree, These degenerates stole a presidential election. We know it , they know we know, they could care less. They are not worried one bit about it , I'm hanging with Potus all the way.
1337972889665081354 2020-12-13 12:09:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> You can only poke a grizzly bear for a short time, it's not disobedient to enjoy the liberties given to us in our constitution. They can't make anyone do anything if we just ignore them and go back to our lives
1337971617281011713 2020-12-13 12:04:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> After my last tweet hours ago I just found my phone, I was at my daughter's store playing with a five yr old. Little rat hid my phone inside an empty coffee can,  my first thoughts was he carried it home. We found it hauling garbage to the dumpster.

1337407678348455938 2020-12-11 22:43:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I don't care what adults do, it's their business. I'm not bashing any adults private lives, I don't judge others. When your education system is teaching anal sex, transgender, homosexuality to kids in 4 th grade that crosses a line.
1337406040611106819 2020-12-11 22:37:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Our education system is a political and depravity indoctrination on our children. They're supporters of pedophilia in our Democrat party. They murder a born baby in the name of abortion rights. This is the party of evil made up of godless demons
1337404718184861696 2020-12-11 22:31:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Our children cannot grow up in a country that teaches sexuality to elementary school kids. Democrats want to influence kids to change their gender.  They despise god and morality and embrace depravity. We can't exist together.
1337270964804050944 2020-12-11 13:40:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Just to see what YouTube was up to I entered conservatives in search bar. All negative listed, and compilation videos of our meltdown over Biden's numbers. Most portrayed us all at bars lol . Goodnight
1337264344694984704 2020-12-11 13:13:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @locoashes He's acting like a traitor
1337264199639162880 2020-12-11 13:13:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all you amazing patriots, Potus has to win. Americans all need to pray for America, And potus. Jesus saves completely,it's easy to do, I'm going with my daughter for a walk it's warm out. Goodnight, thanks for being here.
1337262625743380480 2020-12-11 13:07:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I can't think like they do , and not just because they're traitors. It's all so obvious isn't it? They're evil as you can get and they don't care that we know. I don't want to live amongst people like that or trust them to make sections for our country.
1337260452863209478 2020-12-11 12:58:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's crazy the dems just let criminals right back out into the streets, terrorizing families trapped at home and out of work. Masks, masks, kill grandma. Antifa, George floyd,blm, all to cheat in an election. Power thru fear to control Americans, Why?
1337258796046053378 2020-12-11 12:51:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I wish America was still the  country always divided on issues, Always united on protecting the constitution and upholding law and order. Not that it was heroic to be that way, It was American to hold those beliefs. Half think differently and demand power!
1337256178187952128 2020-12-11 12:41:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The democrats are full of traitors and godless animals. The treasonous acts they've committed against America show they don't give two shits about this country or it's people. How come they're now admitting Biden crime family, dems voters are morons

1337205867251445762 2020-12-11 09:21:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The most common sense gift I collected at the mall was from a lady in her early 40s. She bought and donated 50 6 packs of boys socks and the same for girls. People were very generous and I'm thankful  those who can afford it step up.

1337091290043998210 2020-12-11 01:46:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The democrats are above the law. Trump won, Democrats cheated. Biden and his crime family shouldn't  have been on a ballot. Is anyone going to do anything?
1337090360011599880 2020-12-11 01:42:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm going to be busy most of today, my daughter and I are both involved in a local Christmas gift drive for kids. Today is our day to volunteer till 7 pm. I'm in a mall, hopefully see some loonies and get pics.

1336898912179908609 2020-12-10 13:01:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Dems and msm are probably hoping for millions to start dying of something, probably start a new one ten times deadlier. This covid 19 isn't cool anymore ,

1336890037196247040 2020-12-10 12:26:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The supreme court will uphold the law of the land. It's to obvious to ignore, justice must prevail. The supreme court will rule in favor of America. It's great so many states getting involved, it shows we're one.
1336888704565129217 2020-12-10 12:21:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We all know masks was a scam, wrap toilet paper on face, don't kill grandma. Don't go out and close businesses, mail out ballots, to dangerous to vote. Pack into Walmart okay, voting machines. So Biden could cheat American voters
1336887667884220416 2020-12-10 12:17:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Gods will be done
1336886821926658049 2020-12-10 12:13:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It seems like if I make posts about unnamed individual cheating  in a big event. I can't post for awhile.

I want to see my grandkidS in PA, was gonna go last summer but governors shut down states. I'm hoping I can go this summer if governors allow. Two weeks

1336838927005716480 2020-12-10 09:03:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Pudingtane I probably would wear that today if I had one
1336838191580590081 2020-12-10 09:00:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Longest two weeks of my life!
1336837709164392450 2020-12-10 08:58:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We know mandatory vaccine is on the table, Save me the,that's illegal story. The law is not being enforced on them, they decide it. I'm sure we all wonder what comes after that, I'm thinking steps ahead. How bout you?
1336836084148396037 2020-12-10 08:52:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If you decide to go full mask, would you go theme oriented masks? I would probably lean toward the fashion side of it. Many would go basic, I would consider a batman mask. Cats could wear dog faces &amp; vice versa.
1336834101274357772 2020-12-10 08:44:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> No BS, even if they eventually drop the mask thing, Do you think we will start seeing masks again and again? If the stomach virus comes around do we all start wearing diapers to contain our crap from spreading it👀
1336831616405139458 2020-12-10 08:34:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Everyday I read small town community Facebook pgs in dem states. 5 states of dem towns pages, often have the same propaganda posts. Todays winner  https://t.co/57WLSuCHwh
1336828508857901056 2020-12-10 08:22:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I mean this with respect to anyones choice, it's impossible for masks to work. Anyone in the medical field that claims masks prevent virus  spread is wishful thinking. Just my opinion ,and of millions of experts thru out the world.
1336826736244363265 2020-12-10 08:15:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @KevinEger2 I already had it with my daughter in April, had shortness of breath and tired as could be for a week.  I'm still not masking, I'm not against people choosing to wear masks. If they work why shut down business, if they don't work why wear it.

1336823792094621698 2020-12-10 08:03:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Suzie___H @RealJamesWoods Amazing, trying to keep her from playing till she gets her stiches healed is hard. She went from being a 20 yr old dog to acting like a pup. Miraculously her hair started growing back immediately. God bless for asking, it's a miracle she improved so much
1336821937088114697 2020-12-10 07:56:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It will be mandatory here as well if Potus doesn't overcome the fraud
1336821387806314496 2020-12-10 07:53:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This crap just kicked into overdrive when we fell for the Two weeks scam over 265 days ago. Look how far it's come, everyone keeps saying it's illegal for them to make a vaccine mandatory. The words legal and justice have become hollow, law is an illusion now
1336819826459873288 2020-12-10 07:47:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I saw another woman in a video with a homemade mask put together with a cup off a bra. I feel better about it now, when I saw the first woman with one on I wondered what happened to the 2nd cup, now I know.

1336811469338447875 2020-12-10 07:14:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Are people still wearing masks? You would think the libtards would be over masks. They aren't and they're more aggressively blaming Trump supporters, they're labeling us as superspreaders and we need to be dealt with or eliminated if necessary.
1336807802153656323 2020-12-10 06:59:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I don't like @RealJamesWoods not speaking out anymore, those who know the story of The Man know what he's thinking. say something, can't wait till next election.

I asked what made them worth 50 bucks, she said their fartproof and the company sells them as such. First thought , mask material, 2nd thought who buys fart proof underwear.
1336803576413360131 2020-12-10 06:43:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The supreme court has the final legal say, They better get it right or the law is as worthless as a Democrat. 10 yrs ago I would've been relieved to hear the supreme court is making a decision on this case. Today I'm as nervous as a chicken working at KFC.

1336430064259526657 2020-12-09 05:58:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @BobbieJoRussel1 We never had any mandate, our county judge ruled no. Our buffets have always been open, we never closed and never will
1336428904232443909 2020-12-09 05:54:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When I make posts about not obeying mandates, people attack me and say you're just talking s..., no one's doing anything. I don't obey 1 of any mandates, my part of Texas would've drug County officials in the street, they fear us!
1336427683291533312 2020-12-09 05:49:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @JSWilder2 Agreed
1336427117224013826 2020-12-09 05:47:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> There is always a spark before a fire. We are that spark, our resolve and commitment must increase. We want justice and transparency in our govt, no more backroom deals. Voter fraud will not be accepted. We demand justice!
1336415587002699778 2020-12-09 05:01:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When I got on Twitter my thoughts were after the election I'm gone. Now I know this new order crap ain't going away. I'm staying to communicate with others in case we need to unite in solidarity. This has just begun
1336414630361640962 2020-12-09 04:57:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I support these kind of Americans

1336362641351208964 2020-12-09 01:30:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @TKohlmann4 A lot of PA dems voted Libertarian. They like the my body my choice, support for transgender and abortion. I think a lot don't vote because they can't win. It's to much of a mix of conservative on govt,liberal on social issues. My opinion
1336361039026409487 2020-12-09 01:24:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @dondero_e Which creates a divided party, many dems I know in PA who would vote Biden would vote Libertarian. We would end up with 2 partys, another dem and republican fiasco. Just my thoughts.
1336359681430859787 2020-12-09 01:19:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @dondero_e The basis of their belief includes abortion at anytime. My body, my right to do as I want

1336357842270498816 2020-12-09 01:11:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Libertarian will not get my vote due to their lefty thinking on social issues. I like their less govt side, but the rest is dem talk
1336356754582597632 2020-12-09 01:07:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @THoosiergator Wouldn't that be wonderful, I would do a pay per view event on firing all the libtards
1336352706093600770 2020-12-09 00:51:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm old enough to remember George Floyd, the man who  caused patriots to awaken.

I'm looking for Patriots to run for office, I don't want to waste my vote on any career politician again. We're all voting the lesser of 2 evils till Potus came

1336179387780263937 2020-12-08 13:22:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Before I leave I want to ask folks to remember how important Chuck Yeager was to America. His life was an example of being a Patriot. God bless his family. He was the evil knievel of piloting.

1336173212506464256 2020-12-08 12:58:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> These governors and mayors want more deaths,  they can drag it out and impose more restrictions. People are just accepting it and thankful,   all the long creating this prison environment

1336168549841309697 2020-12-08 12:39:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Dems are purposely flooding testing sites
1336168235901853696 2020-12-08 12:38:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They don't mind one bit the suffering they imposed on their citizens, their lives are better with less peasants in the way
1336167779746066432 2020-12-08 12:36:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> He did accelerate the undermining of our constitution and messed up the insurance business for us

1336166060538654721 2020-12-08 12:29:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> the dems want it to be, they want more deaths to keep it going.  They want us all wearing space suits.

1335995493533577217 2020-12-08 01:12:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The Dr who is our friend told us it's a requirement of all insurance companies. It's a cdc guideline, if a Dr chooses, he can state that patient doesn't wear mask. Medical bills will not be paid. Drs are required to ask  https://t.co/PhFhgrSycl

When the drs office does insurance paperwork it's a question. Was patient wearing mask. He said they can refuse pay if Dr says no.

1335663558684766211 2020-12-07 03:13:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Rob_R6153 My concern
1335661425969262595 2020-12-07 03:04:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If  justice doesn't prevail in this coup attempt, I'm ready to take back my country. How about you?
1335660684936441856 2020-12-07 03:01:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I don't want to live with these people, they're destroying our nation.
1335659381027975172 2020-12-07 02:56:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They don't like us or our freedoms, they're training their followers to hate us. They've already declared war on our constitution and our way of life. That's not going to satisfy them, They want us gone as well,  Soon they will keep us from communicating .
1335655795875328009 2020-12-07 02:42:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Read that all and think about it, we know it and sit day after day waiting for it to end. We have to end it , fear is not an option.
1335654276983644163 2020-12-07 02:36:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Man sold the plan, they conspired with politicians. They silenced our medical experts to make us listen to their plan
1335653856139767808 2020-12-07 02:34:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They stole our election, they're destroying our country. These politicians are an enemy to the people.
1335631949034119170 2020-12-07 01:07:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If you're searching for answers to what's happening in our world, Hurting inside,unsure of your purpose and don't know who to turn to. Cry out in Jesus name to your heavenly father, he will send you his word. It's a gift of god, not due to your deeds
1335619565502533637 2020-12-07 00:18:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Heavenly father please wrap us in the arms of our living savior Jesus Christ, I pray for your peace and mercy to be upon America. I pray for those who are searching for answers during these times to call upon Jesus for eternal salvation, in Jesus name I pray
1335452426514690049 2020-12-06 13:14:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all you amazing patriots, Jesus saves completely by faith, it's easy to do.

1335417305824718849 2020-12-06 10:54:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's down right disgusting that the American people can't see or hear from the president of United States. If they do, it's lies and ridicule by lefty politicians and their fake msm. I blame the Clinton's for a lot of it, TDS.
1335405289198260227 2020-12-06 10:06:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughters boutique will be in trouble if China tarrifs are removed. Those Tariffs allowed new American companies to compete.
1335404506406936576 2020-12-06 10:03:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Tomorrow I will have pictures and an update on lacy the dog with the kidney stone. Many on here generously gave to help a family with no work due to covid restrictions. She's up and playing, I almost cryed when I saw her. 12 lb dog, 5 lb stone  https://t.co/aEZtF0s0Vk
1335403144822599682 2020-12-06 09:58:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> 👇👇Bloomberg is as big a threat to our nation as any of the big tech or msm gang.
1335401353842208768 2020-12-06 09:51:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I saw a report by Warren Buffet that stated 50% of American hotels and stores were primarily invested in by foreign investors. The time frame for that big jump was when Bill Clinton was president. Bush continued the same.
1335399653433597953 2020-12-06 09:44:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Sadly in that PA town, since most people get some govt assistance, they're more than willing to shutdown. When the govt is supporting many by overtaxing workers they move or never gain anything. It's best to just go on govt assistance
1335398387911421953 2020-12-06 09:39:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When I was in PA operating the store I paid fed tax, state income tax, county tax, city tax, Tax for having a job. That's right a tax for working. Property taxes thru the roof. At least 50% getting some kind of assistance, no other option but move.
1335397306347163648 2020-12-06 09:35:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Today at the auction the farmers were talking about how bad there business would do under a Biden presidency. I don't know if it's true, they were saying China is buying up land to run giant commercial farms and put them out of business.
1335395716433403904 2020-12-06 09:28:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm so sad people believe a mask is necessary, that's what got us to where we are. The mask is a comforter, people say I just wear it to please other people. Or wear it to avoid any problems, that's conforming to a new normal doing that. No Mask
1335394419277697026 2020-12-06 09:23:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter in PA lost her store I gave her, I was there 2008 till 2012 taking care of my parents till they passed.The store had been operating in a town with an average income of 26,000. The store never made under 80,000.  https://t.co/u2Pnz0HCFL killed it.
1335392786930167809 2020-12-06 09:17:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I bet money right now the politicians who told their citizens to stay home are out dining and drinking. I'm sure they get a little liqoured up and get to laughing about it.  They don't allow you to go have fun, it's just for the elite. Mask up!

1335319397678931970 2020-12-06 04:25:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Texas is a big state, sometimes it's along drive from town to town. I realized today that many of those folks are local community thinkers. They never trusted the federal govt and pay little attention to the news, just weather reports.

1335316770362707968 2020-12-06 04:15:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> on my road trip I stopped in  for coffee, no workers had masks on. Half the customers did, all pulled below their nose. I asked one guy why he was wearing a mask, big burly farm guy. He said his wife told him the news said you had to wear it. I educated him
1335315025788080128 2020-12-06 04:08:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @msharrper I stopped there, a little hole in the wall. Great eats, did you see their salads

1334983414332743680 2020-12-05 06:10:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> What's a vintage mask? I get it, the store is boutique and gifts. She told us we were missing out on the vintage thing. She was out there, I'm glad she doesn't live here.
1334982724512256005 2020-12-05 06:07:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Those of you have worked in a store before know the amount of weirdos that stop in. It's  like a freak show some days, we're on a major Hwy, mostly travelers. Most folks are amazing, some days you wonder how we managed to survive.
1334980885385515014 2020-12-05 06:00:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Just had a wacko from San Francisco stop in my daughters shop. This woman was ranting about rednecks with guns killing animals to drink their blood. She was in a brand new Mercedes convertible, she was looking for a vintage mask. I busted up laughing.
1334975390000033797 2020-12-05 05:38:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Mtnhaven1 You have to buy them from a licensed by the state seller
1334974770996277248 2020-12-05 05:36:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Do you think there will be incentives to get your friends and family to get the vaccine?
1334974136851034116 2020-12-05 05:33:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I wonder if you get a gift card when you get the vaccine?
1334973412570230784 2020-12-05 05:30:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @KrakenPecans That's my guide lol
1334973289089937413 2020-12-05 05:30:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> All we can do is relax and let cnn, Twitter, Facebook fix everything. Then life will go back to normal, that's what everyone wants.
1334971948057628673 2020-12-05 05:24:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm certainly not an expert like Bill Gates or Cuomo on vaccines. I wouldn't advise anyone on it's safety, I'm waiting for Twitter to verify it's safety.
1334970954049581060 2020-12-05 05:20:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I wonder if they send the same vaccine to every state. Is there a dem and conservative vaccine, one for each group. I thought vaccines took yrs, that's what the experts cnn, msnbc, Cuomo, Pelosi and Facebook. They all said that when Potus was working on it.
1334969842999365633 2020-12-05 05:16:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @RealBreckGirl I laughed for 20 minutes when I heard it.

1334967595343155200 2020-12-05 05:07:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Thankfully good old Clinton, Obama, Bush will go on TV for a live performance, to get a vaccine? Seems strange to me, why go on TV and make it all dramatic? The three Amigos, At least that makes it safe if they take it. When pigs fly.
1334965921509761030 2020-12-05 05:00:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This whole virus deal right before an election that involves a President who's working to make America great for all Americans. Then masks, shutdowns, mail ballots, caught cheating, then curfews. Got to get a vaccine to get a card to live free.

1334960575458254851 2020-12-05 04:39:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> How many Republicans are really democrats? If I was a fox, I would act like a chicken to get in the hen house.
1334959612106305541 2020-12-05 04:35:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Every state is  making plans to push out the vaccine, the bonus is the card you earn. Obey, get a couple shots and you can go to work and eat out. That all sounds like China or a science fiction movie, That doesn't sound like America
1334956553242284033 2020-12-05 04:23:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I would certainly be nervous about taking a vaccine from a globalist group that believes in population control. What does population control mean? Are we weeding out the sick and elderly or people who disagree with their beliefs?
1334955134422540289 2020-12-05 04:18:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> only dems are  expert on covid, notice that? A supposed unknown virus that we already had experts working on. Cnn, NBC, all media they're experts on covid. Real experts are censored, discredited, silenced, why? What's their goal?

They said the the Republicans will go crazy when Joe takes over. I didn't say anything,  when they left we both busted out laughing.
1334875522313170944 2020-12-04 23:01:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Sometime in January now they said we will reach 100 million immunity to the fake pandemic? Why a vaccine if they're going with that BS. Notice how fast the vaccine push has accelerated. At least you get a get out of jail card for getting it
1334874038750093312 2020-12-04 22:55:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I wonder if the rich folks will get bubbles with gold and jewels on them? Will we the commoners be assigned certain style or colors of body bubbles? That way they can know who is part of the elite
1334873146583867394 2020-12-04 22:52:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I wonder if their will be a reward for turning people in who don't obey? New businesses will open into that field, Rat.

1334671865441357824 2020-12-04 09:32:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My brother is on his 12th day escaping PA, he's at my place in Texas. He says he's more comfortable with his mask on, he worked 7 straight months living in a facility taking care of disabled adults. Had to sleep with a mask on.
1334670532751609862 2020-12-04 09:27:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Remember Bidens 78th birthday video with Stacy Abrahms and a room full of other commies all celebrating. No masks on, probably why Biden hid in the basement. They were all probably sniffing each other maskless.
1334669430094172161 2020-12-04 09:22:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The mayor of Austin Texas was on vacation in Cabo San Lucas and put stricter mandates on the citizens while on vacation. The mayor of Denver CO. restricted travel during Thanksgiving, then flew to MS to have family Thanksgiving. They're all doing it!
1334668076273594369 2020-12-04 09:17:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's already the new normal isn't it?  long ago that two weeks to slow the spread was said. Now curfews,small businesses closed down, Covid more deadly after 10pm. Their living big while they gleefully destroy lives. Wear your mask is their favorite line.

Had to wear a mask, carry books in one hand, hold a body shield in the other hand. I got it stopped after a month by contacting the local republican congress woman &amp; 300 parents I stirred up.

1334574666690781186 2020-12-04 03:06:10 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Oklahoma and Texas are blood brothers, even tho Louisiana is under a Democrat govenor, I trust the majority who are freedom loving folks.
1334573152677076995 2020-12-04 03:00:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I looked up my counties votes, Potus got 72% of the vote. The interesting number was 90%  of Biden votes were mail in. Never paid attention till today. I'm contacting local election authorities today, I'm curious.

1334570549771636736 2020-12-04 02:49:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Texas democrats, not including the unwelcome Californians. Live where their are jobs everywhere, opportunity, cheaper housing, no state tax. They vote Democrat, I say move to a Democrat state and live if that's your thinking. We don't want you here
1334569629721702400 2020-12-04 02:46:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If you are in PA in the summer time, most of the influx of people are PA democrats living in Florida. They're still voting in PA as Democrat. They live a free life in Florida, then vote to imprison their home state folks under dem leadership.
1334566323515486212 2020-12-04 02:33:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Florida a free red state is loaded with northern democrats enjoying the life of Florida. But voting in their home states like PA, NY,,NJ Democrat. These are the most hypocritical voters in America.

1334308532951375873 2020-12-03 09:28:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> People obey because they just want it to go away, they don't know what to do. Govt has ideas they must know how to save us, lets try it. Who doesn't want to trust your leaders on something new  like a Pandemic. They lied then, they're lying today.
1334296720985960448 2020-12-03 08:41:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> destruction to peoples lives, Childrens lives altered, uncertainty, fear, anger. Can't live a semblance of a normal life because your govt told you to stop, Wear a mask.  It's Fast becoming the normal in many places. It's as normal as wearing glasses
1334289839097864192 2020-12-03 08:14:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @LindaNDanny Sadly a govenor operating under the state emergency orders does have that power. I don't know if all states but certainly most. It's crazy when I started looking at the unlimited powers they obtain from covid, scary.
1334288966615502850 2020-12-03 08:10:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They have to be laughing about the amount of people who accept their manipulation of the media. While doing that they're brainwashing their followers to believe we're manipulating the media. I laugh just thinking how obvious they are.
1334287983588073472 2020-12-03 08:06:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We talk about the masks and business closings, churches,grocery stores limited hrs. Stand up = death, need mask, Sit down = safe. Many people have already lost all freedom, they don't realize it yet. Take the easy targets first= sheep, Then?
1334285670194540544 2020-12-03 07:57:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> 261 days ago they told stories about wearing these harmless silly masks, it's just two weeks (giggle), Then it will be over. That's the day it  started, stop! Think how far it's gone.

1334252142140518401 2020-12-03 05:44:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I don't believe in systemic racism,  I never judged a person by skin or beliefs. I get along with anyone who wants to, some folks just like to be left alone. I like that our country is made up of all kinds of people. We used to be one America, dems hate that.

We're a country of law and order, I'm waiting on justice to play out. Then we will see if anything changes. No Masks ever.

1334168787738882048 2020-12-03 00:13:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My brother who fled PA is used to wearing a mask, he's having a hard time assimilating. We went to a breakfast buffet, he was the only one with a mask. He worked in medical so he wore it always. It's normal for him. I'm being patient, he knows they don't work
1334167187788066817 2020-12-03 00:06:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I wish I had a video compilation of maskers going berserk. If anyone knows of one I would appreciate a link. We all need comedy in our life.

I do a lot of volunteer work, it's got hard to get volunteers anymore. Many places had to hire people which defeats the purpose. Thank you for helping
1334154646810714113 2020-12-02 23:17:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The first time a masker tryed messing with me I turned so he could see my 44 on my side. Now I get more joy out of tormenting them and making them mad.

1333998893248487432 2020-12-02 12:58:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Two more people donated for Lacy, the dog having surgery. We have 305 of the 600 needed. Tommorow we pick her up to lay up two weeks to recover. In the morning we will stop the go fund me and I will pay the difference tommorow.

1333482627668520966 2020-12-01 02:46:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @klb145 Thank you so much, I'm very humbled by you helping. God bless.
1333477553529556992 2020-12-01 02:26:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I hated asking for help with the go fund me for my friends dog. I lost a lot of my income from roses during covid or I would've paid it all. I paid 400 for the preliminary. Christian folks all including vet. Thank you
1333476671798857730 2020-12-01 02:23:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This is the link to help my daughters friend. I can promise you this is totally legit, I have personally invested $400 in it. I would appreciate anyone that can help. The vet expects a full recovery. Thank you all.   https://t.co/LlISm80sXC

1333465267322630146 2020-12-01 01:37:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @flipflopflo55 I did a week Ago and got 20. Surgery is tommorow and he needs 600. More. I can't afford more than the 400 I gave. I was hoping someone knew another way. I can get the vet to give him time I think. Go fund me didn't work. Thank you
1333463822389096452 2020-12-01 01:32:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughters friend has been out of work since covid. He moved in his elderly parents home.

1333262384153174016 2020-11-30 12:11:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm encouraged and happy that so many Black folks woke up and joined us. They find out who's lying and creating division, I'm proud of our diverse,yet unified people following Potus. We all want the same things for our families. God bless!
1333233939138351106 2020-11-30 10:18:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America, I'm going to spend the evening with my daughter watching movies. Thank you all for sharing with me. Jesus Saves completely it's easy. Goodnight and God Bless you all, Pray for Potus and America. Trump2020

1333206853715693568 2020-11-30 08:30:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I was reading the newest report on Bidens fall, it stated his Dr confirmed he's in excellent condition for a man at 77 yrs of age? I thought he turned 78, his Dr has been his personal Dr since 2009. My dogs in good shape for 16, he's deaf, one eye blind
1333202334093094915 2020-11-30 08:13:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Wildpoki No, they portrayed it as tho he was boyishly playing with his dog. I'm sure he just fell

The big prize is canceling Christmas, The day we use to celebrate our lord and savior Jesus Christ. They can't have that, many will comply

Are we being complacent waiting on the plan as we lose more freedoms. They will fight to cancel Christmas because you can't control people who trust in Jesus,not them.

1333168166713880577 2020-11-30 05:57:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Justice is slow is another term I dislike. Justice is swift and decisive, slow justice will do nothing. A clock is ticking, something decisive fast is what we need. Our Rinos could help if they haven't been compromised
1333166776641859585 2020-11-30 05:51:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Are any of you tired of the phrases, breaking news, just in, bombshell dropping, Trust the plan, you will be surprised, we've got them, Proof, enough evidence. None of it means anything without results. I'm not deserting Potus, What plan?

1333163143045009410 2020-11-30 05:37:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> What happened to the guy who was in business with Hunter? He had met Joe and knew he was the godfather of the family crime ring. He had phones, paperwork and all kinds of info. Who's investigating that?
1333159292023795715 2020-11-30 05:21:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I saw a couple Patriots tweets defending Barr and Durham. Both stating unfollow if you don't think these 2 are going to bring this election fraud to light. I have learned enough to know Potus is the only 100%. I'm liking Pompeo a lot as well
1333158336406155271 2020-11-30 05:18:10 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I know a prominent congressman, he was a patriot who ran for Americans. His summary of govt was it's a cluster...., almost impossible to get anything done. Spend your time to read 1 bill and your term is up.
1333156604754137089 2020-11-30 05:11:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We need a new party fast, I'm not liking either party. I certainly don't trust them, we're voting on the lesser of two evils program. Trump changed that, I can't vote the lesser of two evils again.
1333155316574412809 2020-11-30 05:06:10 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I agree, I'm not defending him anymore, we don't have time. The clock is ticking. I know justice is slow, or is he not doing anything

1332771442874839048 2020-11-29 03:40:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have to go clean out my critters stalls, back later
1332771232341692417 2020-11-29 03:39:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I just got a Twitter deal saying my acct was showing suspicious activity. That I would be limited
1332767723273719808 2020-11-29 03:26:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My County never mask or any closures, everything stayed open. Yesterday I was in a mall with thousands of people( no dead bodies) I saw a hundred with a mask on, I asked one guy if he was worried about covid, he said he was wearing it for the flu. New norm?
1332765177440301059 2020-11-29 03:15:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I support this, they needed bigger numbers
1332763495788638216 2020-11-29 03:09:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I read a bunch of libtard tweets attacking Senator McConnell yesterday. Not one disputed his tweet or offered another alternative. They just tweeted he was ugly.
1332762656126758916 2020-11-29 03:05:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Alan Dershowitz said it's over, Bidens gonna be president. I know he made trips to Epstiens island, in the beginning he was talking the fraud was obvious.
1332762035294253062 2020-11-29 03:03:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Yes indeed, it would be over quickly
1332761847146147842 2020-11-29 03:02:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Like a Gulag, we perceive it one way, but are they leading us to this?
1332755248331567104 2020-11-29 02:36:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Thebigeasy63 The cashier gave me a disgusted look, she did have mask, shield and gloves on. She was looking at me like I was a murderer. I rather enjoyed it
1332753432822870017 2020-11-29 02:29:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Hard time choosing which one to get  https://t.co/NYjc8KObwg

1332739641410252800 2020-11-29 01:34:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @AcresofHistory Dem and media along with Fauci and WHO, Gates all pushed it so heavy. I think he just played their game
1332735948325531654 2020-11-29 01:19:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Patriot_Barbie Agree
1332735828859215872 2020-11-29 01:19:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I don't usually share videos, this one is short and shows how another country views our election👇👇
1332734524199989248 2020-11-29 01:14:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Kelly48722576 Were they live it's still masks
1332733831103852546 2020-11-29 01:11:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm excited about the vaccine, all the sheep wanted it, but msm made them paranoid of it. I can't wait to call them out for being hypocrites and refusing science I'm of course not taking it, but I never thought it was necessary.
1332732814031196168 2020-11-29 01:07:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> No doubt
1332732183669317633 2020-11-29 01:04:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My area is reporting a flu going around, I'm going to dig in and find more out about it. I'm sure they said it lasted 48 hours, I never heard a 48 hr flu before, so I'm gonna investigate it Monday at the county health directors office.
1332730170457944068 2020-11-29 00:56:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Why does a bear crap in the woods? So democrats afraid to go in the store have something to eat. Saw it on a meme, seemed funny at the time.
1332729411523796992 2020-11-29 00:53:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When I was in Dallas last week I bought a pint of milk to put in my coffee jug. I placed it on the grocery store checkout belt, it touched the ladies (dem) eggs ahead of me. She told the cashier and refused the eggs. She was mad and caused a scene
1332727546409078785 2020-11-29 00:46:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @jackieblue045 I ate monkey in the Philippines
1332726869100290049 2020-11-29 00:43:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I started eating Korean BBQ this summer for the first time off a food truck. That food is amazing, if you haven't tryed it I recommend it. Texas is obviously famous for BBQ so I never tryed it till my daughter took me there. Cabbage heaven
1332725030107680776 2020-11-29 00:36:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> There is a small chain of pizza places here that say Authentic Sicilian pizza. Owned and operated by two amazing families from Kuwait. The men all have handle bar mustaches and play the role. Everyone raves on their authentic home recipes. I know them well
1332723534901153792 2020-11-29 00:30:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> 👇👇
1332720050239918087 2020-11-29 00:16:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Yesterday when I posted about the Chinese restaurant owned by local Mexican family with a Canadian cook. While eating there, the owners told us a local Mexican restaurant was owned by Chinese with a Korean cook. Eating their today, authentic with a flair
1332714870916214785 2020-11-28 23:56:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I see a lot of Drs with my immune disease, including Pitt university a place working on vaccines. They didn't wear masks when I saw them, neither did I. Because they're unnecessary, it's the flu, and it's now weak.
1332713137070608385 2020-11-28 23:49:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It was great having friends for the holidays come visit from Florida. They're moving here in January, bought a house.   We all ate outside 6 ft apart wearing masks &amp; shields. Nah I'm lying, we did it the American way. We don't have any rules
1332698825841106944 2020-11-28 22:52:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @miles_commodore Nothing is certain with our govt so full of corruption. The democrats are more like organized crime than elected officials of America.
1332544097714905088 2020-11-28 12:37:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America, My guests are finally leaving and my daughter and I are going fishing. Jesus Saves completely it's easy to do, thank you all for sharing. Pray for Potus and America. Goodnight, God Bless you all
1332537861422374913 2020-11-28 12:12:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Lol
1332537594178134017 2020-11-28 12:11:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They're not even hiding it, they've gotten so much power they're now dictators.
1332503748451700738 2020-11-28 09:57:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> After 2020 I don't think anything would alarm me again. If someone told me there was a grizzly bear on my toilet, I'd just shrug and wait till he's done.
1332502435240288256 2020-11-28 09:51:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Fishhea36139754 Thank you

1332499406227169283 2020-11-28 09:39:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Stay home peasant, while I go visit my family
1332497875780202507 2020-11-28 09:33:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @LindaK5165 Awesome
1332488577616392208 2020-11-28 08:56:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @realKTim1 Last I heard he was on a hunting trip
1332485352884490240 2020-11-28 08:43:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm off to go eat my authentic Chinese buffet. Back later God Bless America
1332483650684936193 2020-11-28 08:37:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I remember when Biden was mentored by a KKK wizard #BidenCheated
1332477769494786049 2020-11-28 08:13:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> What's Barr doing? What's Durham doing? Remember when we thought they were Patriots. Potus is all we know that's 100% on the American peoples side.
1332475066282627079 2020-11-28 08:03:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Twitter won't let me share a pic unless I turn my mic on?
1332473211330719748 2020-11-28 07:55:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Agreed
1332472043200270339 2020-11-28 07:51:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> What a Nazi Newsom is and that pipsqueak mayor. Uncle Adolph would be proud
1332471201856368648 2020-11-28 07:47:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If Jesus is in your heart it makes every day just a little bit sweeter.
1332470373900824578 2020-11-28 07:44:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Scamdemic, shhhh don't tell the dem voters. We won't have to deal with them in public
1332469164867522567 2020-11-28 07:39:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @trumpsmyman I use a wok regularly, cooks fresh veggies amazing
1332468831558701056 2020-11-28 07:38:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Everyone has TVs bigger than a 10 seater dining room table on sale. Computers, no deals, major price increases. I'm looking for tablets for my five grandkids, no deals. The guy at cnn doing bad things on zoom caused a price hike.
1332466300728250369 2020-11-28 07:28:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @xrpmonoploy It's mighty good food, still funny
1332465458369482752 2020-11-28 07:24:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Thankfully we're leaving soon to go to a Chinese buffet owned by a local Mexican family with a Canadian cook. I like my food authentic.
1332464745820139527 2020-11-28 07:22:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Surprisingly in a packed mall in a very conservative city, their are zero dead bodies in the parking lot.
1332464296421322752 2020-11-28 07:20:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This is my first white Friday sale, I learned the stuff on sale is not in stock. The cookie place in the mall is lined up with people paying $6. For a cookie.  Pizza by the slice and meatballs the size of a softball have big lines as well.
1332454876077584385 2020-11-28 06:42:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We know the commies did it
1332454172306845697 2020-11-28 06:40:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> These people better get their shopping done before 10, That's when covid comes out. If they sit down we will be okay, it only attacks the standing. Unless you're in Walmart, that's a safe zone. I'm stuck in a packed mall looking for gifts
1332452255061184512 2020-11-28 06:32:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Amazing read, even a Democrat might could conceive it. It's Science, read it and learn
1332451217960734723 2020-11-28 06:28:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I met a couple at the mall today from California, She started crying that she could be out with people  and smile and talk without toilet paper on her face. Freedom has a sweet smell!
1332450452173107207 2020-11-28 06:25:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It seems to me like they're trying to destroy small businesses and take away your living. That way you have to count on them for a bread crumb. Then they own you, we're not doing that.
1332449645847588866 2020-11-28 06:22:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Remember when you used to turn on the news to see what was happening in the world? Now you turn it on to see what the next big scam is.
1332448865656692742 2020-11-28 06:18:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Last election when we voted for Jake Trapper, Chris Cuomo,Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon and Billy Gates to be our health experts, I didn't realize what liars they were. MSM is fueling the Lies and fear, sounds like Treason to me.
1332447285771431937 2020-11-28 06:12:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Our govt, Fda, cdc and even libtard science agrees 480,000 people die every year in America from tobacco related illness. Not this yr, miraculously Covid cured all them, then covid killed them. The numbers are all lies, Hence the name scamdemic.
1332444285338341377 2020-11-28 06:00:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> These govt leeches will not give your freedom back. We have to tell them No More. Stop complying and it will all end.
1332443787717644293 2020-11-28 05:58:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The Boston Tea Party wasn't a bunch of tea slippers eating scones. They were pissed off Patriots about a govt trying to tax and tell them what to do.
1332443186745237504 2020-11-28 05:56:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Bill Nye the top scientist and libtard would dispute that. Not that he knows his ass from a hole in the ground.
1332442733160648715 2020-11-28 05:54:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> 👇👇I would like to give my vaccine to any Biden voter. I'm just a nice guy
1332442452624629760 2020-11-28 05:53:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's the same old BS, msm will wheel out a near death story and want to shut the world down. World, people die everyday of a million causes, you can't claim covid killed them anymore.
1332433144545484801 2020-11-28 05:16:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @DianaRene21 The dems would love that wouldn't they
1332359907560058880 2020-11-28 00:25:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all you wonderful Patriots. My guests will be leaving this evening so I will be busy most of the day with them. We're going to the malls for white Friday sales. They're moving here from Florida Jan 4th, got a house lined up. Back later
1332358078197592064 2020-11-28 00:18:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @danprimack You should take care of your mental illness
1332183459750686720 2020-11-27 12:44:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Don't forget tommorow is white Friday and all the sales are on..
1332183020841873409 2020-11-27 12:42:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @amixpestcontrol Great idea, my state doesn't give much welfare. We would all have to move to blue states
1332182604561457153 2020-11-27 12:40:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @BethPerez1110 Happy Thanksgiving to you
1332176245115777027 2020-11-27 12:15:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America, My guests are going home tomorrow, my daughter is getting a card game going. Hopefully tomorrow we get news, Jesus Saves completely it's easy. Pray for Potus and America, God Bless you all. Goodnight &amp; Thanks
1332175206408916992 2020-11-27 12:11:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> That's awful, small business can't afford shutdowns. You lose everything you have.

1332173724917837824 2020-11-27 12:05:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Edible masks, you heard it first. Follow me for more dumb ideas. Their probably are people who would buy them

1332172861004521472 2020-11-27 12:02:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @beneficial77 @_BarringtonII Lol, so true
1332158093917106176 2020-11-27 11:03:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Did wearing a mask while eating add to the flavor of your meal
1332153289861967872 2020-11-27 10:44:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Didnt see any democrats
1332149532356976645 2020-11-27 10:29:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> RBG final wish was for the supreme court to overturn Cuomos Nazi mandate.
1332088435818061824 2020-11-27 06:26:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @amixpestcontrol Not the ones enforcing mandates, I assume the police is infested with libtards.
1332087981646155777 2020-11-27 06:24:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's a lie everywhere, local news show other states stating their is so many dead bodies the military is there collecting them, not true. None of it is, democrats and msm aligned to overthrow our country.
1332086968717615104 2020-11-27 06:20:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> That's what we need to see, Open up your business.
1332086630035951616 2020-11-27 06:19:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> or the 2nd or any other
1332085272419463169 2020-11-27 06:14:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> No, we know the scam
1332084970806980609 2020-11-27 06:13:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Bad cops, brave patriot, bad govenor. Patriots yelling and refusing to comply, that's what we need everywhere at once.
1332083793109389313 2020-11-27 06:08:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @BethAnneMcC317 @miles_commodore Happy Thanksgiving to you
1332074536347561986 2020-11-27 05:31:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @miles_commodore Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family, even the democrats
1332071064860565508 2020-11-27 05:17:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We know why Democrat s and msm kept yelling for more tests. They didnt get the amount of deaths they hoped for despite 5 Democrat govenors murdering nursing home patients. Cuomo and wolf with the strictest shutdowns have the records for deaths.
1332070071045382147 2020-11-27 05:13:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They funded and orchestrated and many participated in it. They even bailed out the rioters to go do more crimes.👇
1332064000075501570 2020-11-27 04:49:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> That's like sending your trash  man to go do brain surgery. I thought they were smarter than us.
1332063188255436800 2020-11-27 04:46:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I agree
1332062596657262592 2020-11-27 04:44:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The whole joy of suing the nazi politicians, it would bring to the light how many times they violated their own mandates. Let alone the obvious suppression of our rights, might cause supreme court to step in
1332061592733749253 2020-11-27 04:40:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When the mask mandate stuff started happening 8 yrs ago it seems. Our county judge held an open discussion with cdc officials recommending masks. Over 40,000 people showed up opposed to masks or shutdowns. Still haven't done either.
1332059859760582662 2020-11-27 04:33:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If a politician in my area did the crimes these dem mayors and govenors are doing. Everyone including me would be at their house 24 hrs a day yelling for him to come out. He or she would not be able to sleep at night or live a Normal life

1332048537350266880 2020-11-27 03:48:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @old_tarheel I was a public speaker for Zig Ziglar and a vp in MLB, NFL, NHL, NBA,. I'm used to talking in detail at great length. Due to limited characters on this format, I attempt my own shorthand that I hope can be deciphered lol
1332047174293721091 2020-11-27 03:42:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Another day in Paradise 2020 style with my daughters lap dog. Stealing my salmon, I fought her and got part of it back.

1332044788170952707 2020-11-27 03:33:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @old_tarheel When I get angry about something like that mayor shutting his citizens home, then he flys to Ms to visit family. I type fast and don't check, I typed allowed, it changed to aloud. LOL, got 10 dms informing me
1332043857253584897 2020-11-27 03:29:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Cool night coming tonight 68, that causes the fish to go into a feeding cycle. Last night it was 70 when I went to bed, woke up 70. During 3 am till 5 am it was 54. Our cold is between 3 am and 5 am normally. If weatherman says 40 tonight, I won't know it.
1332042723013103618 2020-11-27 03:25:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Most Democrats and Republicans suck. Trump saved their butt, only a small group doing good. Barr sucks, Durham sucks, Chris Christie is a big Rino. Only takes a few minutes to name the good ones. Fox sucks, OANN is the only 100% for me.

1332002914223710209 2020-11-27 00:46:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrat voters are at home watching a parade ethnically diverse of course. So flagrant with division, Happy Democrat Thanksgiving. I don't want to get along with these people. They create racism solely to divide Americans. They ruin everything

1331985914449551361 2020-11-26 23:39:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm going to feed my animals, I have guests. God Bless America and all you  Patriots. Enjoy Thanksgiving whatever you're doing. I pray it's a day of rest for all, I was so mad I couldn't sleep. That Denver mayor set me off, they shouldn't let him back in
1331984387425046529 2020-11-26 23:33:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @DuckdogWI I agree, would've already done it
1331984268076134401 2020-11-26 23:32:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Are weak link in America are Democrat sheep voters. They're afraid and happy to comply and kiss their govenors ass for saving them. What a disgrace to all who gave their lives for our freedom. Nazi govenors eat shit!
1331982197587398656 2020-11-26 23:24:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> These mandates are making citizens live in a hostile environment. That's not America, these smug ass democrats are mocking Americans.
1331980510055309312 2020-11-26 23:17:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Who is enforcing Deblasio bulls hit? I can't understand how the people living there or anywhere allow it. It's not happening where I live because if it did, we wouldn't have any politicians left.
1331979699812265986 2020-11-26 23:14:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> These govenors and democrat politicians are taunting us. I don't like these commie threats to Americans. How bout you? We need to be outside their house 24 hrs a day yelling. People say you're not in it you don't know, that's true, that's why it's not here
1331977868314861571 2020-11-26 23:07:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If the dems want to be sheep, it's time to release the wolves.
1331977536314732549 2020-11-26 23:06:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Forgive my rant on Thanksgiving, I'm so sick of seeing my fellow Americans being treated like animals. These Democrat or Republican Govenors need to be ran out of these states.

1331971529354121218 2020-11-26 22:42:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Dem mayor Denver shuts down Thanksgiving gatherings, flys to Mississippi for family gathering. Newsom does same gets caught apologizes, NJ same thing, Deblasio, Whitmer. Remember these pieces of shit telling you no. They're not doing it.

1331794101877026817 2020-11-26 10:57:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Sounded good in PA today, it was awesome how everyone cheered when Potus called in. General Flynn got pardoned, dems are going crazy. That hearing was awesome, of course msm is on discrediting all who testified on voter fraud.
1331788960180416519 2020-11-26 10:36:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They have no right closing down business, or telling you what to do in your own home. Democrats voted for that.
1331788500157468674 2020-11-26 10:34:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> gaslighting with media and dems,It was overwhelming.Then it started to stink, like BS.

1331687480471511044 2020-11-26 03:53:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @BonBee81 Never liked him
1331686180069519362 2020-11-26 03:48:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm at a restaurant,  and on the TV a govenor said he allowed Thanksgiving in people's homes as long as they are quiet and keep their masks on. Raising your mask to put food in your mouth, then immediately recover LOL.
1331684993026973697 2020-11-26 03:43:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> These kind of Americans won't bow down, they won't go away without a fight.  https://t.co/3VdaR0mZHn
1331670983665737734 2020-11-26 02:47:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Freedom doesn't last forever, unless you're willing to fight for it.
1331670666781790210 2020-11-26 02:46:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have guests and have to go do things I don't want to, because their from Florida they want to go sightseeing. We're going to a couple malls which I never do, Then out to eat at Rainbow forest which I never do, lol. I love them so I'm going, back later.
1331660924189609984 2020-11-26 02:08:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Patriots don't buy from those who enforce mandates. They're Patriots who own businesses, find them and support them. Don't spend your money in a socialist business
1331658120024748032 2020-11-26 01:56:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The mandates are becoming a comedy. Let the sheep comply, Patriots live free. We won't comply to socialists
1331657114952081412 2020-11-26 01:52:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The media is to powerful, it controls the weak minded. Their existence is a threat to all freedom loving people in the world.
1331656502294294530 2020-11-26 01:50:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The media conspired with the socialists and China to overthrow a sitting President.
1331655925858508804 2020-11-26 01:48:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The media is our enemy, they've deceived many Americans
1331655283777605649 2020-11-26 01:45:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> MSM is the most dangerous threat to America, they sold out to the socialists.
1331654926246752259 2020-11-26 01:44:10 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Guess what? Covid is a scam. Obama, Biden, Clinton, Fauci, Gates, their all in on it with their Chinese friends. They plotted with a communist country to overthrow America.
1331654087973146627 2020-11-26 01:40:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @JoePatriot44 I forgot about that option, jail or military
1331652908669165570 2020-11-26 01:36:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> America has fought communism and socialists since it's founding. Now we have a socialist party attempting a coup in our country.
1331652120563621890 2020-11-26 01:33:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Veterans for Biden are traitors
1331474166990708738 2020-11-25 13:45:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all you wonderful people. Had a great time tonight visiting with my guests. Jesus Saves completely it's easy to do. Pray for Potus and America, still waiting and hoping. Thank you all for sharing time with me, Goodnight.
1331415128319930369 2020-11-25 09:51:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm going to have to leave, I have guests for the holiday. We're going out to one of those Japanese restaurants were they cook in front of you. Charge you a fortune and don't give you enough to eat. Back later, God Bless America and all you Patriots.

1331394056975503362 2020-11-25 08:27:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We need protests in every state, even if your state isn't being tortured. We protest for support of our fellow Patriots living in suppression. If that don't work we get louder until they hear us. If that don't work,1775.
1331392658418393088 2020-11-25 08:22:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> What happened to the flu? I heard Bill Gates was ecstatic over the masks eliminating the flu.Many states talking masks till end of 2021, Is this Bill Gates plan. Why are rich democrats making suggestions on policy?

1331390473571864578 2020-11-25 08:13:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Longest two weeks in my life, At least we saved grandma. Have you noticed the orders are getting stronger? No singing, no loud music, no holiday get together, no Joy. No grocery stores for 2 weeks? Are they trying to get us to blow up? I think so!

1331349638243381255 2020-11-25 05:31:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> According to cdc guide Lines no loud music for Thanksgiving? What in the he'll does music playing have to do with a virus. It doesn't, It's just control. They prove it by telling you no singing, no music. No Joy, Wear your mask&amp; shut up!

1330656328084230149 2020-11-23 07:36:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @mickgregory I agree, as of late, I have lost faith in our legal system
1330656122542444547 2020-11-23 07:35:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I agree
1330620305044361221 2020-11-23 05:12:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @marla_carmel Yes

1330614856811163649 2020-11-23 04:51:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @JeffB66545214 @honeyluch I agree, it's just obviously a political trick. I watched a commercial for swim wear, 12 people in swim suits all but 1 Hispanic were black. Next commercial Ford, all black and 1 white. It's a divisional tactic. I never paid attention to race before, why now
1330610598019796995 2020-11-23 04:34:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I never go anywhere without my 44
1330610414128951299 2020-11-23 04:33:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This can't be the first time, we all know for certain now. We have to take action to stop it. We got lazy and they got creative
1330604114519134211 2020-11-23 04:08:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Jeanjean11223 Amen
1330603865595633665 2020-11-23 04:07:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @CantbelieveDems That’s why I didn’t walk out, in my town they don’t do the mask thing at Jason’s
1330603110658674690 2020-11-23 04:04:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Their is a Democrat County 20 miles from me, I'm going to be visiting regular now. I enjoy the maskers flipping out, I missed all that fun. Trump flags flying on my truck of course
1330600969877549061 2020-11-23 03:56:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Agreed, a follower of Christ has only one master, It ain't no democrat

1330599408979808262 2020-11-23 03:49:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I hardly ever watch TV, haven't in 20 yrs. Today I was flipping thru the channels, everything is about covid. Every commercial spot lights masks and racism. Everyone on TV is Black people, democrats will do anything to create division.

1330583717119660034 2020-11-23 02:47:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I went to another County to pick up a Jason deli muffeletta sandwich. I walked into order, the Mgr said I had to have a mask to order, place was packed at the tables, no masks. So I sat down and called my order on my cell, no mask.
1330582402079584265 2020-11-23 02:42:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They think they're gaining strength with their mandates. We're going to have to do some peaceful protests if it continues.
1330561846387101704 2020-11-23 01:20:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Do not comply
1330554094071783424 2020-11-23 00:49:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I agree, These dictators must be stopped, do not comply.
1330544606740701188 2020-11-23 00:12:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Proud to be associated with these people.  https://t.co/0drAx8S9pO

1330539453161627648 2020-11-22 23:51:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I can do all things thru Christ, who strengthens me.
1330537493410754561 2020-11-22 23:43:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Jesus Saves by faith, not by your works or good deeds. Faith, The same knowledge that allows you to sit in a chair knowing it will hold you. You don't inspect a chair to see how it's built, you just sit on it because you believe it works  https://t.co/7eL0ZmgsUj

1330367008802807810 2020-11-22 12:26:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all you amazing Patriots. My daughter and I are doing our usual, going fishing, it's warm and no wind. Jesus Saved me completely and he will you, it's easy, Faith. Goodnight, Thank you all, Pray for America and Potus.

I don't want to be the generation who lost it, do you? Back later, God Bless America, thanks for listening to my rants. God bless all of you patriots
1330340660419977223 2020-11-22 10:41:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> 👇👇funny video, but true
1330339961112064010 2020-11-22 10:38:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @MostLeePeaceful I will watch it
1330338461719650306 2020-11-22 10:33:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I love all Americans, I want the Democrat voters to be free along with us. I'm hoping they will wake up and see what's going on. Can't go worship in your church? Guarantee  they are and will increase suppressing Christians.
1330336502052769792 2020-11-22 10:25:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's not going to end until we end it.
1330335568060960768 2020-11-22 10:21:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They sure are
1330335468144234499 2020-11-22 10:21:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I agree, I'm not ashamed of the gospel. And they couldn't stop me from going to church.
1330334863396917249 2020-11-22 10:18:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Agreed, we're funding our own demise
1330334469644021764 2020-11-22 10:17:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If these politicians putting all these mandates out continue, it won't be long before you can't go anywhere without approval. Look how far it's gone since the two weeks to save grandma started. I don't recognize America anymore
1330332611865174018 2020-11-22 10:09:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @David_Temecula Agreed
1330331435337715715 2020-11-22 10:05:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The politicians are living in mansions with fences and guards sipping on a fine wine. They're telling Americans to put on a mask, no holiday, no going out, just obey. I'm sick of hearing our employees who have shit on our constitution say it
1330329815711424519 2020-11-22 09:58:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I don't see the bodies lying in the streets from the Chyna Flu they claimed was coming. The masks as we know is a total joke, they've all been caught out laughing and having fun without them on. No one dies anymore of other sickness.
1330324844261601281 2020-11-22 09:38:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> What kinda Nazi crap was that?
1330322536832376832 2020-11-22 09:29:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Everyone likes to say things in the moment, if I lived in an area that a politician was doing that to me. I would be in jail if they could catch me sleeping, I wouldn't comply to one thing that steps on my freedoms. I would organize others and call them out
1330321076631572484 2020-11-22 09:23:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @XenaMAGAWarrior No
1330319960778928137 2020-11-22 09:19:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> How many freedoms are these politicians going to take away? My neighbor is confused why I'm involved in this fight. He can't understand  because we are still living the same life. I think a lot of people are that way. I say to hell with these politicians
1330317051890708486 2020-11-22 09:07:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @John_Yuma Agree
1330316115583643648 2020-11-22 09:04:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @BertholdSr I made it home, thank you
1330315942581121024 2020-11-22 09:03:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Our politicians remind me of TV wrestling, they act like they hate each other on TV. I suspect they all hang out together in private, except a few. I had a friend in the secret service who worked with Clinton in the WH, he said they all buddied up.
1330313955223482373 2020-11-22 08:55:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Same
1330312479533113346 2020-11-22 08:49:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @artjlynch3 Like a mini big mac
1330312090825973761 2020-11-22 08:48:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I had my first in and out burger today, it's not even in the same race as whataburger. I kept hearing they would replace whataburger, only if you never ate one. I did like the way they wrap them to eat while driving. It was good for fast food.
1330308339658608641 2020-11-22 08:33:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If there is any justice left in America, Potus will win the election
1330307572843372544 2020-11-22 08:30:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @TRUMP_MAGA_USA_ A lot of people reading it so I'm playing the numbers game. Lol
1330303182153637892 2020-11-22 08:12:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When my daughter and I go to Dallas we always buy bags of burgers and go to a certain bridge were families usually are and pass them out. Today I was thankful to find out many people are going by daily to take food.
1330302253702524929 2020-11-22 08:09:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @TheKolo2 Yep, I bought 12 ft 2x 6 the other day, twice the price
1330301921580740614 2020-11-22 08:07:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Saw a homeless guy bumming on a corner in Dallas with a Trump shirt on. Gave him 10. for advertising.
1330301324508991488 2020-11-22 08:05:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Coming back from Dallas I took the scenic route, Trump flags still everywhere.
1330298771457105922 2020-11-22 07:55:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @angrymom80 That's what confuses me, I have never seen stuff go up and down in a week like this. If you can buy it n the down price weeks it's a saving.
1330296198725586945 2020-11-22 07:45:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Gas is 1.44 a gallon in my area to 1.59. Milk 1 week 2.29 a gallon, next week 3.69, back &amp; forth. Eggs 80 cents a doz, next week 1.30. Beef tenderloin prime 8.98 a lb, next week 15.99. Prices up then down every week. Anyone else seeing this?
1330294689208135682 2020-11-22 07:39:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Remember when WHO was pushing lock owns and masks. Every dem politician was telling Potus to follow the science of WHO. Then WHO said shutting down wasn't good and wearing masks probably not good. Dems don't mention them anymore
1330293284460224519 2020-11-22 07:33:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Gotta love capitalism, grocery stores and drive thru eats are kicking butt. They raised their prices and money is rolling in.
1330292300589699075 2020-11-22 07:29:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Anything happen today about election fraud? Are we still waiting for  courts? Are we getting anywhere? Other than Rudy &amp; Sydney, do we have any powerful people working for Potus? Did Georgia certify their numbers.

1330284429235904514 2020-11-22 06:58:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They're dictator commands, they expect you to obey and give up your freedom. They know what's best for you, mask up and buy toilet paper.

1330017749255467009 2020-11-21 13:18:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Another day of possibly hearing some evidence this weekend. I know, Justice is slow, days are going by quickly and Tucker?  I believe Rudy &amp;Sydney got the goods, just want it to get started. Either way gods will be done.
1329980914420559877 2020-11-21 10:52:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter and I are heading to the food trucks for dinner at the park. Crawfish tacos for me tonight. God Bless America, back later.
1329977079010648064 2020-11-21 10:37:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The Democrat mask wearers have been brainwashed into thinking we're anti safety. They're trusting the govt to guide their life. It's about liberty, freedom, Our constitution is on the line. I'm fighting for freedom for dems as well.
1329975381592580096 2020-11-21 10:30:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We're allowing it to continue, gloves are coming. What's after that? Covid Cards to purchase and travel? Sounds silly doesn't it. Think back 8 mths ago to wearing the mask two weeks. They won't stop as long as we comply.
1329972903455186945 2020-11-21 10:20:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @wesproul Certainly taught me a lesson, plus I got to teach two kids how to change a  https://t.co/yzFHEtprQd
1329962400662106115 2020-11-21 09:38:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I had to show I.d. To buy a can of spray paint today. Voting is more important to have a legal I.d. Than buying spray paint. No one without I.d. Should be legal to vote. Only American citizens should vote. To say otherwise is suspicious at least.

I have never taken my spare out before today. Couple kids stopped and thought I was to old to change a tire. They couldn't loosen the lug nuts.
1329614372889616384 2020-11-20 10:35:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Why do people trust Fauci? Tens of thousands of Drs worldwide have called him out. Of course the media silenced them and discredited some of the finest Drs in the world. Democrat Fauci has been a weapon used against freedom.
1329613114111913992 2020-11-20 10:30:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's safe to be out till 10 with covid, At one minute after it picks up momentum and kills everyone. Why do they really want us home? In the beginning Fauci said by now 3 mil dead, possibly more. If it continued another yr, ten mil🤔🤔

Democrats divide people by race and any other  way. I hate that, We're all the same people. Trusting politicians is foolish

1329244121165426710 2020-11-19 10:04:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I never considered myself a republican, I hate big govt and believe we the people should be voting on our money being spent. I'm a Trumplican now.
1329243537007894537 2020-11-19 10:02:10 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I thought that was clever when I first shared it. Now I'm thinking it could be reality  https://t.co/ieXAczldoN
1329242177059295233 2020-11-19 09:56:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Dewine in Ohio, he looks like the little rat guy in school that tells on everybody. Did he just turn Democrat? Or was he always one.
1329241658316251141 2020-11-19 09:54:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The land of the free is getting smaller. I don't want to live near the Bill Nye the science guy party.
1329240573501460480 2020-11-19 09:50:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Always control and power, shut up, stay home, wear your mask in the house.
1329219716351717383 2020-11-19 08:27:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Do you think if we could find out the party affiliation of the millions getting faulty covid tests. I'm betting more than 80% democrats, maybe their the carrier of the flu🤔
1329217738385002496 2020-11-19 08:19:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If the majority of people who tested positive wore masks all the time, that tells us they were democrats and that masks don't work.
1329217062711988226 2020-11-19 08:16:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Covid only kills were democrats designate it to. Ask them, they will tell you, they have the science.
1329211412045029378 2020-11-19 07:54:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They still preach it and their voters keep believing
1329211170838994944 2020-11-19 07:53:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Because they knows it's false, the dem voter just keeps on believing.
1329210612639940608 2020-11-19 07:51:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Good times
1329210393634467841 2020-11-19 07:50:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Real science unless your a?
1329209493117341696 2020-11-19 07:46:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They like the word experts and professional a lot, I'm a professional bser. Like Dr Jill Biden, lol.
1329208839858741250 2020-11-19 07:44:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I love when democrats use the science word, don't you? They've been manipulated by that word since the 70s. Miami under water yet?
1329208064017387522 2020-11-19 07:41:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @PinkLemAde1 I pray nightly for Jesus to open your eyes to the truth.
1329207696520867847 2020-11-19 07:39:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @KevinEger2 Came to my daughters shop, had to move locations
1329207405255782409 2020-11-19 07:38:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @mrsmyrtlebeach @FansOwens @RealCandaceO I was taunting them, I thought it was fake. I didn't know about fan page. I follow her
1329207127655772160 2020-11-19 07:37:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @KevinEger2 Can't say, already attacked once
1329198167305449474 2020-11-19 07:01:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If you search your states or counties covid numbers on Google. It uses your states official logo and a smudge of truth. Looks like your states official results. Keep scrolling and reading fine print, data received from NY Times.
1329192616894865409 2020-11-19 06:39:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> How many Democrats does it take to destroy the greatest country in the history of the world?
1329191649411534850 2020-11-19 06:35:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Wouldn't Adolph have  approved of our Democrat politicians?
1329191261379719171 2020-11-19 06:34:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @FansOwens What are your thoughts, I respect your thoughts
1329191022497308674 2020-11-19 06:33:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Do you think we could trick the democrats into believing the only safe place from the flu is on the ocean bottom? They seem to believe everything else.
1329190270617997314 2020-11-19 06:30:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @CantbelieveDems I'm starting to lean that way, I don't want to live with godless deviants.
1329187815817687040 2020-11-19 06:20:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrats are trying to destroy it with their deviant godless policies. Hurry up and say God, they hate that word.
1329187417002217478 2020-11-19 06:19:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Can't be,covid kills everyone who gets it. Oh wait it doesn't, millions just test positive with a faulty test and they know it doesn't work. Plus, it's just the Flu
1329173974966824961 2020-11-19 05:25:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Penskefan222 The end of freedom for 500 Alex
1329173823170752512 2020-11-19 05:25:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My County stopped all covid test reporting in September, they know it's just test results with a high fake results. Initial death count for county was 115 covid, they went thru each one and changed the total to 6. That's honesty.
1329171408186994688 2020-11-19 05:15:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> That's the honest to God truth, did a bunch of spineless morons claiming to be Americans escape the looney bin to form the Democrat party.
1329170804744056833 2020-11-19 05:13:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When I was in Dallas yesterday, if I sit down in starsucks I didn't need a mask. So I sit down and yelled, large black coffee please. It worked, if you stand you can catch covid, so I sit down to be safe.
1329167828319150080 2020-11-19 05:01:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @PAPPYL0VELL @kansasauthor Not in Texas they won't, we're hoping for it

1329167111571255296 2020-11-19 04:58:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @CunningVet Research, I read every states Gov page everyday for new updates.   https://t.co/u2Pnz0HCFL

1329155887043407875 2020-11-19 04:13:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Some company sent these to my daughter for a Christmas gift because she buys supplies for making jewelry. We're gonna put it on the dog as a bandanna for Christmas pics. F masks  https://t.co/vthbN9z30U

The ass holes who work for us are telling us where we can go. What time I have to be home. We need an old fashion flushing the crap out election.

1328846043342057472 2020-11-18 07:42:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @mrsmyrtlebeach Getting old isn't it
1328845797048377345 2020-11-18 07:41:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @hdoyle5246 Truth
1328845304343523328 2020-11-18 07:39:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Look how arrogant the two media giants act in a senate hearing. Lying as well, do you think they aren't worried about it?
1328844221919469569 2020-11-18 07:35:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @BertholdSr Unfortunately probably a good idea, how the heck did we get to this
1328843425622462474 2020-11-18 07:32:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Human70610849 Thank you, I'm just frustrated by any real efforts to aid Potus. It all seems like showboating to me
1328842047244132354 2020-11-18 07:26:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The people calling the events unfolding now conspiracy theories, are the same as the people in Boston wondering why they were throwing tea in the harbor.
1328839379801034760 2020-11-18 07:16:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I didn't share the story about what happened to my family for pity. I shared it because I caused it by posting openly on here. I shared the story again so it doesn't happen to someone else.
1328838458178228226 2020-11-18 07:12:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> These are just my opinions, I don't expect you to agree. That's what America is about isn't it? I'm not trying to sell swamp land, just sharing my views. My views have changed as of recent, any of you?
1328836647392342017 2020-11-18 07:05:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Artoris10 She's very capable, she didn't think making and selling flag earrings for July 4 th would be a crime.
1328835313083494400 2020-11-18 07:00:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I think we're the only people who talk about the constitution anymore. At least the parts that include our freedoms.
1328833777792147466 2020-11-18 06:53:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> States where democrats control everything are gonna feel the heat first. The faithful obedient dems will comply and inform on those who don't. Government doesn't fear us or our votes.
1328832332292362240 2020-11-18 06:48:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The govt won't voluntarily work for the people anymore without Potus. We're cattle
1328831474313932800 2020-11-18 06:44:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> These people in Washington have stomped on our constitution and our rights so long. The paper it's written on is no better than a crappy face mask.
1328830579241086976 2020-11-18 06:41:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @TruthInMeaning Me to
1328830482415542273 2020-11-18 06:40:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Potus is in the way of big govt plans, they're not hiding anything. It doesn't matter if we approve or not, we're in the way as well. I wonder what the next obedience command will be? Kill our dogs because 80% chance of covid if you own a dog
1328828785588903938 2020-11-18 06:34:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> That's why they aren't fighting for Potus, the Rinos don't like someone interfering in their plans
1328828007277096962 2020-11-18 06:31:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Keep the faith, keep the faith, Potus is the only one I'm trusting. Is he alone on this? We got some good lawyers working on it. Big bombshell Rudy said he hopes the military has it, then says I'm sure of it.
1328827127509159936 2020-11-18 06:27:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We're supposed to keep the faith in these investigations, I'm thinking Judas is the one telling us that.
1328826475190030339 2020-11-18 06:24:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Look at Georgia, conservatives were celebrating a great govenor. Looks to me like he's enabling a fraudulent vote
1328825884413976576 2020-11-18 06:22:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I wonder if the congress or the senate even consider us while making decisions. I think they make decisions to help themselves and get some TV time. Potus was 100% working for us.
1328824666807545856 2020-11-18 06:17:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Another day of bombshells coming, when is one going to blow up? So and so said tommorow it will be revealed. I know, justice is slow.
1328821955185811458 2020-11-18 06:06:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The hearings on Facebook and Twitter, just another show. They know nothing is going to happen, they most likely pay half of them little nuggets of gold
1328821429085892609 2020-11-18 06:04:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @jar3q They said all countries matter
1328820862947102729 2020-11-18 06:02:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They need to know they work for us, they separated us into groups to manipulate the masses. Easier to control a divided nation.
1328819992113065989 2020-11-18 05:59:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Agreed👇
1328756868475478019 2020-11-18 01:48:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @JustGladImFree Me promoting it on here caused it
1328756686677569542 2020-11-18 01:47:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> On my way to a dem city to get my calf, turns out she had huge bladder stones. Going back to that convenience store for more free coffee. Providing the hateful Democrat weasel is working today. Back later, God Bless

1328750632258457607 2020-11-18 01:23:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @kansasauthor Of course, my brother is a federal officer. Democrats attacking conservatives is the number one reported crime in America
1328748401157152770 2020-11-18 01:14:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @GEIequestrians Very scary
1328747675248971778 2020-11-18 01:11:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have never hated a group of people in my life. Democrats are full of evil people. The others are caught up in their own smarter than thou righteousness. They think they're wiser than us. They believe all their fake info as their party burns America.
1328746618699517953 2020-11-18 01:07:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I appreciate everyone's offer to buy from my daughter, those that have followed me awhile know the story. I dm people  her page here and they were in their as well. I can't for safety do it again. I stay at her shop most of the day.
1328745394428317697 2020-11-18 01:02:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I used to mention were my son lived and worked. He had to quit his job, both he and his wifes car were destroyed. Be careful and never mention your children. Had they come for me the bodies would've been unrecognizable
1328744357206388737 2020-11-18 00:58:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This is what caused my daughter fear and the loss of her online income. The threats from democrats was scary for them. They destroyed her online shop.  https://t.co/Ufxs9WO1vn
1328743766543446016 2020-11-18 00:56:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @kenzie45230 Can't, it was my stupidity to post her stuff on here. That's how they found us
1328743246948921347 2020-11-18 00:54:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @GEIequestrians That's how it happened, I did it in June for her flag earrings. I learned then that many in our group are not conservatives.i shared her info and bad stuff happened. They destroyed her Etsy acct. And openly threatened on here.

1328741504530214913 2020-11-18 00:47:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrats have threatened two of my daughters and my son. They destroyed my daughters online Handmade jewelry business because she made American flag earring and sold them online. They came to her shop. They have taken away her living, and created fear.

1328736077629313027 2020-11-18 00:25:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @PinkLemAde1 That's an 8 month total and cdc who you trust states less than 10,000 were covid deaths. Overall deaths in America are lower. People die everyday, now they die of covid for cash rewards. 480,000 die every year from cigarettes, now all covid

1328536719189299200 2020-11-17 11:13:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Every time masks and covid comes up stuff happens. For awhile they were silent about covid. We talk investigations covid is big again. We will be busy staying apart, riots could start again. All to do what they did, Cheat us.
1328535191544094720 2020-11-17 11:07:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Maybe I'm just paranoid and trust the new crumbs of hope I get daily. Any day now, is starting to sound like, wear the masks two weeks over 8 mths ago.
1328534409734189060 2020-11-17 11:04:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Put on your mask time again, thankfully Fauci hopes by next summer after the vaccine we might quit wearing masks. I guarantee the vaccine will be mandatory if Potus is gone.
1328533641081856000 2020-11-17 11:01:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They seem confident and defiant, not afraid like we want them to be.

1328527658729304064 2020-11-17 10:37:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's the normal for the brainwashed Democrat. We can't count on them to awake, to many have been hypnotized to believing msm propaganda
1328521744542470145 2020-11-17 10:14:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We're sounding the alarm! It's really happening isn't it, An American Political party cheated in a presidential election. They don't care that we know, This is history being changed. We're going back to were our founders were before they came here.

1328509174754533378 2020-11-17 09:24:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Masks and covid is rising because they're covering their tracks. Worked the first time
1328508708855422978 2020-11-17 09:22:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> How many times are we going to allow the same people to recount votes?
1328508122361700355 2020-11-17 09:19:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I don't trust the recount deal at all. Don't you think the same cheaters have a hand in it as well. Did they all get honest since they stole an election?

1328461076871176194 2020-11-17 06:12:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> You can't convince a brainwashed dem that masks don't work. They provide more of an opportunity to get sick than not wearing one. They get their science from their  either way masks are unnecessary.
1328460107504562178 2020-11-17 06:09:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Bridget75652369 It's so sad
1328459949081583624 2020-11-17 06:08:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> One of my neighbors sold his 300 acre ranch. Half of it is very rugged land. A California developer offered him 15 MIL, he sold it to a local developer for 4.2 MIL. He didn't want democrats living on land his forefathers were buried in.
1328458921892253698 2020-11-17 06:04:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Texans have grown to despise Californians, I know their are great conservatives their. Their worthless democrats move here to avoid taxation then vote Democrat. My County is doing its best to not allow California developers to gain a foothold.
1328457616360607746 2020-11-17 05:59:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Texas feel like our neighbors in Oklahoma are family members. I love Oklahoma folks

1328446617553416200 2020-11-17 05:15:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @GreenHammer4 I'm not gonna answer that, now you know
1328445789711044609 2020-11-17 05:12:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @SubduedRadical 12 yrs ago I shot an armed robber at a convenience store. He had a gun pointed at a young girl behind a counter
1328444060370137089 2020-11-17 05:05:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The guy at the gun range said f Biden, we didn't elect him president of Texas. Let the other states deal with him. He just walked away, that was his final answer.
1328443099950043138 2020-11-17 05:01:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> People ask me all the time if Texans are forming militias. The answer is if you live in Texas you are born into a militia. We live that lifestyle daily, I wear a 44 everywhere I go. Robbers tend to avoid you when your dressed that way.
1328442035486011392 2020-11-17 04:57:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I also saw a dog with a mask on at the vet. It was my first one to see, little fuzzy dog. He wanted to come play, the owner turned the dog away so it couldn't see me. Kinda like I was a leper, made me feel pretty good.She had a 49ers mask on.
1328440916886040577 2020-11-17 04:52:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter and I were going to go to the shooting range. They told me ever since the election you have to reserve a time a week ahead. They have moving targets, makes it more realistic.

1328437277538869251 2020-11-17 04:38:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I just called that convenience stores Corp number and told them about the weasel and the coffee. He had been instructed to not press the issue with customers. I have to go back tommorow to pick up my calf. I'm going back in for more coffee.
1328436054504968198 2020-11-17 04:33:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> And tarred and feathered

1328430494938255365 2020-11-17 04:11:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I was in a Democrat city to get my calf checked. I stopped in a convenience store to get coffee the weasel behind the counter said you have to have a mask to pay for the coffee. I said OK thanks and walked out with the coffee.

1328201072909963264 2020-11-16 12:59:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> These democrats are disgusting how they ruin lives,and harm our children with this abuse of power.Masks, now they want you to go back home. It truly did start with, Wear the masks two weeks. We didn't get loud enough immediately.
1328198233806532608 2020-11-16 12:48:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It sucks to worry about an election you know Potus won big. But the other guys are openly trying to steal it, they don't care that we know. We can't let them do that, they hate us.
1328196474358919170 2020-11-16 12:41:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We're being faithful to Potus as we should. We just need to see wheels turning instead of hearing about it.I know it takes time and tomorrow is supposed to be big. I hope it is, I don't want time to slip by. I don't want to hear next Wednesday we will.
1328194852375453703 2020-11-16 12:35:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I can see how people that are easily made afraid,could become manic from wearing a mask.  Watching TV, signs everywhere, everyone wearing masks and avoiding contact. That fear would cause many people to become unhinged.
1328193706176950273 2020-11-16 12:30:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @kansasauthor Wore it to the movie theater, daughter bought it for me as a gag gift.  https://t.co/Ma5MYyygGl
1328191890903212033 2020-11-16 12:23:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Masks, it was just a short two weeks, worth it to save grandma. I can't wait to see the new summer 2021 mask line.  Masks made fear a reality, it's scary wearing a mask. We obeyed!
1328182809912090625 2020-11-16 11:47:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I had to go do some socializing, my neighbor invited my daughter and I to come eat chicken fajitas. He had roasted red potatoes, peppers and onion, green Chiles. Very tasty Texas dish done old school. Gonna say my goodbyes to them, back later.God bless

1328134420876947456 2020-11-16 08:34:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Believers in Jesus who study the word know the plan being unfolded. If Potus gets cheated out, look up, for thy redemption draweth nigh. Christ will come in the clouds to rapture his church.

1328083037242990593 2020-11-16 05:10:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I read a piece that said car manufacturers are going to be making inserts for inside your car to put plexiglass between you and other passengers. Don't worry if you have an older car,they're building an adapter kit.

Not wearing mask, not social distancing, not vaccinating. I'm gonna keep living and talking to folks without toilet paper on my face.

1328070427676119041 2020-11-16 04:20:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Years ago I was always trying to figure out who the traitors and commies in govt were. Pretty easy today to figure it out.

1328036572919369730 2020-11-16 02:06:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Republicanmama2 It's funny that states are passing a law to be legal to shoot rioters and looters. Thats common sense and legal here always

1328031749713104897 2020-11-16 01:46:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Even liberal Austin, first place that shot the rioter
1328031002858557441 2020-11-16 01:43:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They only do that crap in places that allow it. No rioting or looters ever in my area. Police wouldn't be able to get there quick enough to save the rioters

I was at my coffee shop this morning and locals were laughing that some states just passed a law that a looter could be shot. They couldn't conceive the idea that rioters and looters are protected by dems. We could always shoot a looter

1327738682120544258 2020-11-15 06:22:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @V8powerforever Nah, I'm just playing around
1327738436044861441 2020-11-15 06:21:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @KristenSkogebo It's a joke
1327738258164490242 2020-11-15 06:20:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm getting the feeling that democrats hate conservatives. Not that I care
1327734699935092737 2020-11-15 06:06:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm not either, every legal vote deserves to be counted and verified
1327734262091669507 2020-11-15 06:04:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Only 984,000 followers to go to reach a million. I'm killing it!
1327730898712866816 2020-11-15 05:51:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Good question👇
1327717661346848768 2020-11-15 04:58:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I don't want to get along with democrats who believe in taking away freedom.
1327694222854598656 2020-11-15 03:25:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @NYGovCuomo Eat shit Adolph
1327680001311989762 2020-11-15 02:29:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Commie news
1327678988379099136 2020-11-15 02:25:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Just met some folks who moved here from New Mexico. They came in my daughters shop, parents were conservative, 2 teenage libtard kids. They moved here to get their kids away from libtard ism. I gave them a big Texas welcome
1327677545018437637 2020-11-15 02:19:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @MontanaHippy @shirlee92125879 Best of buddies, my older brother is a federal officer. I'm a big supporter of the blue.
1327668103346597892 2020-11-15 01:41:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @c_r_y__o_u_t We need to run them out
1327667900279349248 2020-11-15 01:41:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter went to her DR yesterday, he doesn't wear a mask or his workers. He told her he read Drs in dem states are suggesting wearing masks from now on during flu season.
1327664766077296642 2020-11-15 01:28:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Wore this to the theater last night to see the James Bond movies  https://t.co/BYZHA1efbl
1327663921042485249 2020-11-15 01:25:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @JosephNNorris1 They looked terrified when I got out, probably not used to seeing a guy with a 44 on his hip
1327662159304790016 2020-11-15 01:18:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I apologize for my rant, a pack of Colorado libtards ran into me at a gas station. They bumped my truck, accidentally. I got out and all 3 in a car had masks on. The drivers glasses were so fogged up he couldn't see. I did laugh at them, told em go back home
1327659805482348545 2020-11-15 01:08:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Fear! That's what controls the people, starts out with a simple piece of toilet paper on your face. Then you're not allowed to be with your family, we obey out of fear.  Afraid they will punish us, the people who live off our money, commie politicians.
1327658120424861697 2020-11-15 01:02:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My younger brother escaped PA and has been in Texas a week now. When he first came I thought he had lost his mind. He didn't realize the changes that had happened to him living under a Nazi regime. He's finally back to normal
1327654536790552579 2020-11-15 00:48:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Please Mr politician can my family have Thanksgiving together. They most certainly will not obey that commie rule. Neither should you, you were born free just like me. I will die a free man who lived the American life of freedom, never obedience.
1327653581948940292 2020-11-15 00:44:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The next person who asks me to stop being selfish by not wearing a mask, I'm gonna vomit on. It's always a traveler coming thru my town at a gas station. I'm kicking the next ones ass
1327652498040115201 2020-11-15 00:39:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Masks are unnecessary! That's all it comes down to. They're not gonna keep you alive, they're not gonna keep you from catching the flu. They are gonna make you lose your freedom thru obedience to a charlatans.
1327649376160911361 2020-11-15 00:27:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Americans are out buying toilet paper again. It didn't take long to train our citizens to obey. If you do good the dems will give you a treat. They cannot tell you what to do, We're losing freedoms over a piece of asswipe on your face.
1327648032905629698 2020-11-15 00:22:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I support your right to wear a mask if you wish to, I respect your choice. Don't try to convince me of any benefit to wearing one. It only takes common sense to no it doesn't. Covid is the flu, no dead bodies lying in my town. We don't mask
1327647241818021896 2020-11-15 00:19:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm sick of being sympathetic to the mask believer. I understand many people are forced unconstitutionally to wear one, God Bless. The person who believes they work, no more pity. Masks are unnecessary, They do nothing.
1327646084617949185 2020-11-15 00:14:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> 👇👇Fact, These commie politicians and bs doctors aligned with dems and msm manipulated people into thinking a mask works against a virus. It doesn't, I'm telling you believers in the mask, you have been played. Doesn't work, it's obedience
1327643247741644806 2020-11-15 00:03:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America, The land of the free and the home of the Brave. The nazis are all over MSM ordering citizens how to live. Democrat politicians need to be held accountable for their crimes against America. 2 Weeks, Shove it!
1327641962116239362 2020-11-14 23:58:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @AnthonyCharlino @TexasKenJSmith NE Texas
1327400551894618114 2020-11-14 07:58:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter and I are heading to the movie theater they're showing Sean Connery  James bond movies. Goldfinger&amp; thunderball for $6. Burger and fries 6.99, I don't drink but dollar draft beers is a Friday special. God Bless, back later
1327356089919287296 2020-11-14 05:02:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My dishwasher part just came, I had no idea you could get same day delivery from Amazon. I don't order from them, my daughter ordered it today and it's here. Let's fix this dishwasher
1327352517177520130 2020-11-14 04:47:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @PamelaJ66882820 Good neighbors
1327352059205738497 2020-11-14 04:46:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The attitude were I live in Texas is  we're going to live as we did no matter what the rest of America does
1327346295779061763 2020-11-14 04:23:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If I lived in a place with mandates I would be in jail or worse.
1327344642329894913 2020-11-14 04:16:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I don't feel like I live in America anymore, I don't like the new whatever it is.  I have friends in other states I talk to regularly, many are concerned to speak up about the Tyranny in their  states. Doesn't sound like my America
1327340606197293056 2020-11-14 04:00:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I am not giving up any of my freedoms, I'm prepared to stand up and be counted
1327340135483142146 2020-11-14 03:58:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm my own president so I only listen to God and myself. No thanks
1327336590952325121 2020-11-14 03:44:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My Parler is the same name as twitter  https://t.co/6hu9vLDMZw
1327333233181286400 2020-11-14 03:31:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Doing it now and have been, my County did no mandates because we wouldn't have obeyed them.
1327324518197698564 2020-11-14 02:56:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> How long are we supposed to sit by as they try to run a fraudulent election by us. When are we going to say we're not taking it anymore.
1327316097805246467 2020-11-14 02:23:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> George Washington started these United States. Democrats used George Floyd as the igniter to destroy these United States
1327315616861220865 2020-11-14 02:21:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> You get what you allow to happen
1327312637655478273 2020-11-14 02:09:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Got the dishwasher to reset and it worked. Need a new control panel, called for part they wanted  197. My daughter got it on Amazon 49.
1327307743997386752 2020-11-14 01:50:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @I_love_our_USA Ice makers, usually you have to remove ice tray, should be a reset button there. Usually red
1327304108928360450 2020-11-14 01:35:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @JoyLoveCats435 I can usually fix anything, hoping my luck continues
1327300733549621252 2020-11-14 01:22:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm doing dishwasher repair right now, these new models are not easy to navigate. All computer operated
1327293246624718849 2020-11-14 00:52:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @paulC38 Already saw them  https://t.co/uwN7nZnuQi
1327292603541426176 2020-11-14 00:49:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @XenaMAGAWarrior Same, I kept checking my internet connection. If I make 5 to 6 posts in a row I can't do anything for hours
1327268948258250752 2020-11-13 23:15:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Can't wait to see the new masks for 2022
1327268520133058562 2020-11-13 23:14:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Two more years to flatten the curve on the flu that only kills people who don't riot
1327263365597696000 2020-11-13 22:53:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Dem voters don't understand what happened. If Biden wins an honest election, I would go about my business and work toward the next election. If we allow this wide scale fraud to go unchecked in our voting, Americans votes never counts again
1327260713744818177 2020-11-13 22:43:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @vacluiis I wonder
1327260532399861762 2020-11-13 22:42:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> No other time in modern history, Biden with his clearly declined mental capabilities would be allowed to run for president. Let alone win
1327259464131600395 2020-11-13 22:38:10 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @AxialEquatorial He's always knowledgeable
1327256126598098944 2020-11-13 22:24:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I knew they would cheat, never dreamed it would be this scale of cheating.
1327254936216809474 2020-11-13 22:20:10 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Msm, shut up and crown Biden king, we told you who won. Don't ask questions or dare challenge our authority. Put on your mask and obey.
1327252799562919936 2020-11-13 22:11:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Justice isn't alive anymore, The law doesn't apply to democrats
1327242721946439680 2020-11-13 21:31:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @XenaMAGAWarrior All day everyday, I used to post 200 a day, now maybe 10 to 20.
1327121402676342785 2020-11-13 13:29:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America, My daughter and I both have fishing fever, we're using minnows and livers. Jesus Saves completely,it's easy to do. Pray for Potus and America, Goodnight and thank you all for fighting for America. Goodnight and God Bless you.
1327119626816335872 2020-11-13 13:22:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I can't figure out what the Democrats plan is after they sell out our country. I can't think that way, they're pretty dumb. They just get away with anything by utilizing msm to feed their worshippers. Can't be good for America.
1327116845430747137 2020-11-13 13:11:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Has anyone noticed their is no white people in commercials anymore. Covid probably killed them all. Democrats are hoping to create hatred again. I'm not playing their division game. I support your right to be you and wish safety and prosperity for all
1327115571381547008 2020-11-13 13:06:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The almighty all inclusive Democrat party doesn't seem inclusive to me at all. They're inclusive as long as you fit into their reality. I don't act like them, I respect all people and don't support their division and racism.  I don't like what they believe.
1327113513387646976 2020-11-13 12:58:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I feel like the democrats are threatening me because I support Potus. I'm okay with that.
1327101413873344512 2020-11-13 12:10:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @VoiceinEdmonton @DannyHozack The other guy biden had a fake asthma diagnosis to avoid service.
1327097729529602048 2020-11-13 11:55:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They don't sound very unifying
1327097493205774338 2020-11-13 11:54:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Real drs are silenced by msm and social media
1327097313223913473 2020-11-13 11:53:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This shit is getting crazy, live your life they don't own you. That's not freedom, That's Tyranny and they're enjoying it. I say no!
1327038513070694400 2020-11-13 08:00:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm not ready to let a bunch of criminals steal an election. If only the dem voters weren't so brainwashed. I could unite with anyone who wants fairness in our election. I want democrats and Republicans together to oversee vote audit
1327034168241496064 2020-11-13 07:42:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Chip7141 I'm trying
1327033492086132737 2020-11-13 07:40:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Chip7141 I'm trying to win some over, many follow me. Hoping they will see the truth
1327033058839687171 2020-11-13 07:38:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Chris84716275 Yep, I had it with stage 3 cancer and immune disease, on immune suppressor. It's a flu, it's a flu, nothing else.
1327032272361562113 2020-11-13 07:35:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm not attacking Democrat voters, they've been manipulated. I'm attacking the criminal Democrat party, the party of lies and Treason. I'm attacking hollywierdos telling us how to live. I'm attacking socialist controlled msm.
1327026795762364418 2020-11-13 07:13:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> What do we need a vaccine for, 99% survivability. I want a vaccine for voter fraud. Audit the votes, they're pulling the old cover again. Shut up, stay home, put on your mask and do as they tell you. I say eat crap

1327024655039946753 2020-11-13 07:05:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @JohnCornyn Sir Texans who supported you are wishing they hadn't. We expect you to speak up in support of Potus. Are you now part of the deep state. we voted for you to help Potus not betray him. Your legacy is flushing away, speak up or retire
1327022609679208449 2020-11-13 06:56:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm tired of govt telling me what to do, my area, never mask, no closes, buffets always open, no mask. Govenors on TV, social media telling you to wear a mask, I say NO. If a business were I live said masks, they would be out of business
1327019193645019143 2020-11-13 06:43:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @mustngpati Happy Birthday! I hope it's a wonderful day
1327018715171401730 2020-11-13 06:41:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Lynnsather1966 Nope, they charge more, Chinese buffet I was at today is owned by a Hispanic family with Vietnamese cooks
1327017574132051968 2020-11-13 06:36:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Me either
1327008580063686663 2020-11-13 06:01:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The democrats are lighting the covid fears again. Distraction from the issue they committed Treason and cheated on the election. Don't look or covid will come kill you and grandma. Democrat voters are terrified while their politicians are living it up
1327006550406336513 2020-11-13 05:53:10 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @NancySpinelli9 Yes
1327004220587970566 2020-11-13 05:43:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Covid is just the flu, people died and they do everyday. The democrats are pushing the Hoax again, 220,000 died from covid. Lies by dems &amp; msm, cdc shows less than 10,000 from covid. Deaths lower this yr than last yr. Shut up, put on your face diaper
1327002874514198535 2020-11-13 05:38:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @TerriMcnutt2 Thanks
1327002426092773377 2020-11-13 05:36:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Jim_Strohmeier I just started eating it a year ago and I love it. Never would try it, once I did I'm hooked
1327001866736197639 2020-11-13 05:34:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have been completely off the grid all day, I fixed my neighbors car and he insisted I go to a Chinese buffet. I ate my weight in sushi.Did I miss any big news?

1326906972239704068 2020-11-12 23:17:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> America deserves the truth, we need the votes audited. Integrity and honesty should be a priority for all Americans. There has been to many irregularities in many states counting votes. Make it honest and I will support the outcome.
1326903935576256512 2020-11-12 23:05:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Audit the vote

1326756939116797952 2020-11-12 13:21:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @PinkLemAde1 Quit watching TV, every American who had a job saved taxes. Same old uninformed answer the wealthy don't pay taxes. Could be true they're all democrats, Gates, Bezos, Zuckerberg, Bloomberg on and on. They own the dem party.
1326756097265373184 2020-11-12 13:17:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all you amazing Patriots. My daughter and I caught a few crappie last night. We're heading back,Goodnight.

1326744281298694144 2020-11-12 12:31:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @bereal2all Thank you
1326743445780750338 2020-11-12 12:27:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> America under Potus was booming creating new jobs and opportunity for everyone. Democrat states were collecting big tax bucks, capitalism works for everyone. I'm thankful for the tax breaks which let's you keep more money. Dems will take your money
1326741481214930944 2020-11-12 12:19:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless our military past and present, They made America great. Potus brought us back, It's been an honor to be on here with a group of people who care about all Americans. We just want an honest election, We aren't cheating and we're willing to prove it.
1326696483710771200 2020-11-12 09:21:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm going to get off for awhile my neighbor called and his car broke down. I'm going to go get him and haul his car home. God Bless America

1326679019811725313 2020-11-12 08:11:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> On  Veterans day, a day we acknowledge sacrifices made for military service, many paid the ultimate sacrifice. We're wondering what freedoms we will lose tommorow. We can't trust over half of our govt. Who controls them? What's their reward?
1326670135160147968 2020-11-12 07:36:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Put on your mask and do what we think is best for you or we will fine you. Shut your business down because we said so. You're not capable of taking care of yourself. We will let you know what you can do. Sound like America? Land of the free.
1326655801772158978 2020-11-12 06:39:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have to go feed and water my livestock, back later. God Bless America
1326649004101414912 2020-11-12 06:12:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Do you wonder if New York and PA allowed the nursing home slaughter of covid intentionally?
1326647442209726471 2020-11-12 06:06:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The Democrat voter fact checks any truth utilizing the very people who have manipulated them. They use the NY times or CNN to validate their brainwashing. They think we're radicals for fighting for their freedom as well ours.Biden cheated
1326645376414339075 2020-11-12 05:58:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> For the first time in my life, I'm wondering if we can continue as United States under Democrat rule. They claim they want to list us as Trump supporters. Sounds a lot like wwii, doesn't it?
1326638254242885633 2020-11-12 05:29:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm 68, our younger generation hasn't seen the deterioration of our nation. They don't understand how many liberties we've lost. Democrats of today just want you to do as they say and it will be okay. It's not okay with me, I'm not giving anymore freedom away
1326637151405150211 2020-11-12 05:25:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @kitcat1111 @old_dog1 Thank you
1326636074957991940 2020-11-12 05:21:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm not giving up any of my rights or freedom to live as I chose. The democrats are threatening to punish Trump supporters.  I'm concerned that an American political party has turned radical enough to even insinuate that. We must drain the swamp!
1326634421957632005 2020-11-12 05:14:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm looking at this great country that I love, I don't  recognize some of our actions anymore. Both parties used to come together for what was best for our country. The differences today are to far a part on what is best for America. Freedom is disappearing.
1326627796513415169 2020-11-12 04:48:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm tired of govt telling me what I can and cannot do. The democrats are getting bolder, while our Rinos sit idly by and do nothing. A rioter or any criminal has more rights than we do. Justice is becoming a hollow word, I'm not sure we have it anymore, you?
1326625588564676610 2020-11-12 04:39:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @CarrieSonak Got it, thank you
1326625244245860355 2020-11-12 04:38:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Much love to all our Veterans out there, it's important to remember the sacrifices made for our freedoms. Freedoms that media and a rogue Democrat party is trying to take away from us. They tell us to just obey, do as we tell you, no questions.
1326621711987511299 2020-11-12 04:23:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If you used to follow me, check and see if you still do. Also make sure I'm following you, in the last week I picked up 3800 new followers but have less than I did a week ago. Thank you
1326620999153049603 2020-11-12 04:21:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The summary of events that have taken place over the last 8 months has been to take away your freedom. They kept us occupied with riots, looting, fear and a propaganda machine utilizing our media to manipulate the stories. It's got to stop now!

1326566154995953664 2020-11-12 00:43:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @PAPPYL0VELL We caught 9 crappie, they were biting and the wind changed to coming from the south. And it was over, not another bite. We caught the 9 in the first 5 minutes.
1326540902324604932 2020-11-11 23:02:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @bellasouthone @PattyforTrump I lived in Denver in 1981, it was not liberal then. Liberalism is a contagious disease

1326390723231567872 2020-11-11 13:06:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Last 2 nights we fished we caught 14 lbs of cleaned channel  cats. We saw a lot of crappie around the boat house two nights ago, wouldn't hit our minnows. Tonight we're jigging, in the lights from the boathouse shining on the water.
1326389344710631425 2020-11-11 13:00:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @bereal2all Feeling good, a little fishing helps to relax
1326389105626918914 2020-11-11 12:59:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We demand to be heard, politicians work for us, we the people.

1326344500172771328 2020-11-11 10:02:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Standing up for your rights, not  giving them up
1326343817314922496 2020-11-11 09:59:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @PinkLemAde1 No, but it would be less bias than the times. Look at local info in WI, MI, PA. Read small community news. See what the people who live their think
1326339463421812736 2020-11-11 09:42:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @PinkLemAde1 Do your research, look for the truth. It's their if you have an open mind. Quit following the party propaganda. Good luck
1326338664922755072 2020-11-11 09:39:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> How can Biden who has had evidence brought forth showing he took pay off money even be on the ballot. To many people know what he has done.

1326333756580524037 2020-11-11 09:19:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Masks are totally unnecessary
1326333306741411840 2020-11-11 09:17:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I don't like the idea that a supposed American political party rigged an election. They tryed to take away our votes, don't give up. Potus is our leader, he's still working and so will we. Call your legislative, demand recounts

1326306281922187266 2020-11-11 07:30:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The democrats talk about unity, but that's only if you agree with them. That's not unity, it's submission.
1326303305916624898 2020-11-11 07:18:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The democrats were able to do this thru fear. Wear your mask or you will kill grandma, said Cuomo. The guy who massacred nursing homes

1326228661037641729 2020-11-11 02:22:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> 30 minutes ago I posted on parler Bidens Senile and a pedo. Agree?  No answers, it's a backup, great for info. Do not assume it's conservative site. It's not, the owners have both been on msm inviting liberals to interact.
1326227111447834625 2020-11-11 02:15:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @paulC38 I will later, I'm at my daughters shop helping her. I left them at home

1326218430249381888 2020-11-11 01:41:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter and I laughed all the way back from the V A about the mask they gave me. It looks like two cloth diapers sewn together, supposedly the new tech mask. I wore it this morning to cut onions. No better than toilet paper mask. Masks unnecessary
1326217236063907840 2020-11-11 01:36:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @TTalker2 Yep
1326217143852077056 2020-11-11 01:36:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> MSM is promoting Parler in a nefarious way. Reporting it's an uncensored platform.
1326216704259665923 2020-11-11 01:34:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @varth357 Me as well
1326216643454889984 2020-11-11 01:34:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @foolforfreedom Unfortunately msm is directing traffic to it
1326213438973104129 2020-11-11 01:21:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Look around folks, we're the kind of people who investigate things. MSM is openly promoting Parler, stating conservatives flocked there to avoid censor. Now it states kids on Facebook going there to avoid censor.  Just Google it, libs are flooding it
1326211633765642240 2020-11-11 01:14:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @amixpestcontrol Same as here, I been on it since the beginning
1326211312607780870 2020-11-11 01:13:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @TTalker2 Same for me. All the kids are flocking to it. They can say anything without Facebook censoring them

1326210007331971074 2020-11-11 01:08:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Every liberal media is talking about Parler, Bloomberg News states young people leaving Facebook for uncensored posts on parler
1326208827411329025 2020-11-11 01:03:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @HalselRomona @PatriciaPotyka A million kids from Facebook included
1326208523882164224 2020-11-11 01:02:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Parler is overwhelmed by Facebook people going there. My grandkids are on parler. All the young people are going there as well. A million Facebook people went to parler in one day. Don't you people watch msm? Lol
1326207724380680193 2020-11-11 00:58:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm not attacking Dan Bongino folks, I have been listening to Dan on podcast since day 1. I'm just stating my opinion, parler is a news site, great for information, probably the best now. It just doesn't work for me. You do you
1326202809382039552 2020-11-11 00:39:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @JoeSwan06561112 Been watching him since first show

1326198715523084291 2020-11-11 00:23:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My opinion of parler is it's great for  gaining news and info. It's  like  a bunch of you tube people you listen to for info. For that purpose it's good. For social interaction, it's awful
1326197770353565696 2020-11-11 00:19:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Charlie83868315 Thank you

1326194776396410882 2020-11-11 00:07:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Bongino owns a small piece of parler, a liberal  owns parler. I have seen him interviewed many times
1326193041368113153 2020-11-11 00:00:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When I left the V A hospital yesterday, they gave me the new improved mask because I have an immune disease. It worked great, I cut onions with it this morning, no tears

1326189934559047680 2020-11-10 23:48:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have given up on parler, been there months, not one  comment back on posts. No conversations, if I get shut down here I will be thru.
1326032020347232256 2020-11-10 13:20:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Masks are unnecessary, That's what started the whole fraud voting scam. I'm standing with Potus and saying  no to fox news.
1326030870407426050 2020-11-10 13:16:10 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all you wonderful Patriots. My daughter and I are going to watch a movie and relax. Sounds like we have all kinds of proof of democrats cheating. Jesus Saves completely it's easy to do, Goodnight, Bidens a thief.
1325982520211550209 2020-11-10 10:04:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I won't be on much this evening, had to go get a rod shoved in my back to take a kidney piece out. Doesn't hurt bad, got to lay on my side this evening. Bidens not gonna be president. Pray for my wife who lost her mind, she's very disturbed and needs peace
1325974289967878145 2020-11-10 09:31:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Hopefully, it means you did something right. Masks are unnecessary

1325970579187519489 2020-11-10 09:16:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We need the truth

1325953407102955520 2020-11-10 08:08:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Sad to see the folks of Louisiana living in such fear. The people of that state are unique people, I always loved traveling thru the state. It's not the same place it used to be, I'm not used to being around that many Democrats. Very disturbing.
1325919945104953344 2020-11-10 05:55:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's sad to see so many people living their whole life consumed with covid. I know people who voted for Biden out of fear Trump was gonna take away masks. All live in PA, they've become accustomed to it.
1325918941177372672 2020-11-10 05:51:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @meeshryderdie @westseattleelms @adelle_victoria The cdc released the mask info over 2 weeks ago. The majority of covid cases wore a mask at all times
1325917516447805442 2020-11-10 05:45:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I haven't been around this many Democrat since the last time I did prison ministry
1325917021322809347 2020-11-10 05:43:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Biden would destroy our country, he must not be allowed to cheat. I'm surrounded by dems, these people have many loose screws. They're fearful obedient and brainwashed completely. They're rejoicing about shutting down.
1325915973937934337 2020-11-10 05:39:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The libtards are pushing all Trump supporters white Supremacist, we ride around in trucks beating up gay people. We're also abusive to ladies
1325912360142467072 2020-11-10 05:25:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Masks are unnecessary

1325911685119488001 2020-11-10 05:22:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @adelle_victoria Sorry
1325897324099461120 2020-11-10 04:25:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm in Louisiana at the VA hospital, stopped to get coffee. Wouldn't let me in without a mask. No coffee today, these folks are totally obediently living in fear. They were scared to death when I came in to get coffee
1325853519941935104 2020-11-10 01:31:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @LilacsForever9 I used to think that way, when the owners of Fox came out celebrating Trumps loss, then hired Bidens former head of staff to run operations.
1325852743240736768 2020-11-10 01:28:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @imbbgood I try to be kind to the mentally ill
1325833876195913729 2020-11-10 00:13:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have to say it again, The democrats are so dumb, they can't even cheat right. The fraud is so obvious even dimentia Joe knows it.  Treason

1325672121398341635 2020-11-09 13:30:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @LindaK5165 It's best to step away, makes it more fun when you get back on Twitter. Lol

1325669282894712832 2020-11-09 13:19:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I let myself get angry yesterday, worked it off cutting trees. I'm slow to anger, I love being happy and talking to folks. this election fraud will be dealt with quickly, A fair count of legal votes. I don't want to act like the dems destroying stuff.
1325667581601206272 2020-11-09 13:12:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Wonder who owns that company? I bet no Democrat voter even thinks about the coincidences.
1325666960173096961 2020-11-09 13:10:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They really believe they can get away with destroying our election process.
1325664969694842886 2020-11-09 13:02:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We are going to be victorious
1325664770897436673 2020-11-09 13:01:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America,and all you amazing  Patriots. my daughter and I are fishing, we heard a fishing tale from a guy so we went. Jesus Saves completely it's easy to do. Goodnight, Pray for America and Potus. Fish aren't biting.Biden loses!
1325623903201488897 2020-11-09 10:19:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If this election isn't overturned our country is totally shit, cheating is so obvious and factual. The more you learn the democrats did to cheat, the sicker it makes you.
1325621553351053313 2020-11-09 10:09:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Berndvonfunk @hollywdharriet She has a new show on fox

1325574459907059717 2020-11-09 07:02:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It sucks
1325565575205150727 2020-11-09 06:27:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Curly_Lambeau I didn't no I followed them till someone posted
1325565068071854080 2020-11-09 06:25:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I just unfollowed fox news on Twitter
1325558892508700673 2020-11-09 06:00:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Biden made an announcement,on day one he will start undoing Potus executive orders.
1325556522747879427 2020-11-09 05:51:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @maucrews @liquidlaugh I did
1325556413008027648 2020-11-09 05:50:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Someone in my daughters shop showed me fox breaking news, saying Trump considering conceding. I don't believe that at all.
1325551590426759168 2020-11-09 05:31:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Dog probably just has to take a Biden
1325541165677109249 2020-11-09 04:50:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @TuckerCarlson Sir American conservatives love you. Leave Fox, Go on your own, we will support you. Fox is a dirty network spreading a socialist agenda. We want the truth

1325535451596398599 2020-11-09 04:27:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We blame the media rightfully so, Reality is they work for someone else. We all know that, And as dumb as these democrats are, We know someone's running them. They're above the law so it seems, Who runs the law?
1325531851323224070 2020-11-09 04:13:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> A really chilling watch, a reminder of what's happened. When you have the time, I recommend it.
1325529524516380672 2020-11-09 04:04:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @vdaviswa We're just one big fish tank of deplorable, proud of it.
1325529264691830791 2020-11-09 04:02:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm only stating my opinions on Fox, I'm retweeting everyone elses opinions. I'm not trying to influence you to do what I do. Each person decides for themselves , that's what conservatives do. Don't get mad because I'm not doing Fox again
1325526245317222403 2020-11-09 03:50:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @theRealMizG @MaryCar06954945 I watch it daily, Tucker would put them thru the roof
1325520997915762690 2020-11-09 03:30:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @SuburbanWomanCA @burcham2mary Agree
1325520797079924738 2020-11-09 03:29:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If Tucker left fox and was on 2 hrs a night, I would pay and watch him. Wouldn't you?
1325520128553967618 2020-11-09 03:26:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @kilo_939 No, but I'm going to
1325516325507264512 2020-11-09 03:11:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @hermosagrumpy I agree, that's why I quit Tucker
1325516084275974145 2020-11-09 03:10:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @TyLeger1 Agree, hope we're wrong
1325515796886515716 2020-11-09 03:09:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Duffy12734614 @NoodlesButta My feelings
1325506155439939584 2020-11-09 02:31:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm leaving because they have those few trustworthy, then the rest are gaslighting dem policies and our young conservatives or uninformed ones as well could be influenced. I'm only speaking for me not you.
1325504129976967168 2020-11-09 02:23:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Agreed
1325503935906521089 2020-11-09 02:22:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @lcjmhsog @SnoopaDo I could in Texas
1325503681010290691 2020-11-09 02:21:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @westseattleelms Thank you patriot
1325502094208618498 2020-11-09 02:15:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I decided I'm boycotting Tucker as well. Im not watching anything fox owns. Tucker doesn't need fox, he would have more followers on his own
1325500572288606212 2020-11-09 02:08:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @keepitclaseusa @UkraineBlues The democrats symbol of a new America
1325500134873059336 2020-11-09 02:07:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @QsendM And sore today
1325499550031867906 2020-11-09 02:04:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @QsendM 9 with an axe
1325499162721480704 2020-11-09 02:03:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Rome? What's next orgies at the Whitehouse. Dems will legalize pedophilia in some fashion
1325498350049890304 2020-11-09 02:00:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I was angry yesterday and didn't get on much, I went and cut trees all day. I'm angry that America would allow cheating to happen. Dems or Republicans, will every election from now on just be who's the better thief? Is the Era of honest voting over?
1325496972208377857 2020-11-09 01:54:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We're all a little irritated, we know they cheated and the Fake News is acting like nothing happened. They stole the election, A recount without an audit of the vote is useless. Trump won a landslide, media &amp; commie politicians are selling another truth.
1325489942970175488 2020-11-09 01:26:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm hoping Barr and other honorable people in our DOJ are doing their job. We need to stay loud and they need to do their jobs. If both things happen we will right this wrong. Any body with a brain can see the flagrant cheating, to obvious to ignore
1325488941311647744 2020-11-09 01:22:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> In the last hr, just making posts I lost another big group of followers.
1325487055942668289 2020-11-09 01:15:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I don't know what you're talking about, if you don't like my posts unfollow me. I have never said that before, nor have I ever unfollowed a patriot.
1325484831032086528 2020-11-09 01:06:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Americansoul14 Love it
1325484752095350784 2020-11-09 01:06:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I still trust our govt system, I don't trust the govt players. I don't trust most of the Republicans. I'm not really a Republican I'm a Trumplican, I'm conservative and believe in the constitution. I support safety&amp; opportunity for all Americans
1325483538586677248 2020-11-09 01:01:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @mattbuyscars I have a parler, I have posted and get nothing. When I lose my followers here I'm done
1325483245895643138 2020-11-09 01:00:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm thinking if Pence or Don Jr runs next election we need to work in advance. Republicans have poor groundwork, the dems win local seats because they work everyday years in advance. I'm still counting on justice to prevail and Potus keeps the job.
1325482089786052611 2020-11-09 00:55:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I enjoy talking with like minded folks on Twitter. I love make a couple hundred rambling posts everyday. Can't do it anymore, the more you post, the more followers you lose. I'm looking at 4 yrs from now as well. If I lose followers I will go back to fishing
1325480883114086400 2020-11-09 00:50:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @rey_atl Agreed, I figured out the more posts I make the more followers I lose. I'm a heavy tweeter, usually 200+ a day. I cut back, or I won't have any followers. No use being here if I can't communicate. Parler sucks for me. I post no one sees it.
1325446645530718208 2020-11-08 22:34:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Newsmax is awesome to and free
1325313420628021249 2020-11-08 13:45:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> How long do we let them go on with stealing an election. Their won't be no reason to vote anymore, they will be okay with that.
1325312719302631425 2020-11-08 13:42:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It all started with the mask.
1325312415219716096 2020-11-08 13:41:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrats pulled the most treasonous crimes in our history. And everyone knows it, Americans should care.
1325311865988276224 2020-11-08 13:39:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Voting again is the only fair way to resolve it. If they didn't cheat why wouldn't they do it.
1325311480301056000 2020-11-08 13:37:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Those all sound like we've been screwed around, mask mandates.
1325311038422716417 2020-11-08 13:35:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We need to get aggressive with the Republicans and let them know we won't be voting for someone who isn't consistently  supporting Potus.
1325300226668834817 2020-11-08 12:52:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all you amazing folks, I'm gonna watch a movie with my daughter. All my chores are caught up and I'm looking forward to being on here tommorow. Goodnight, Thank you all, Jesus Saves completely. Bidens not my president.
1325265292306608131 2020-11-08 10:34:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Don't go on Facebook, you know it's a Nazi celebration. Many bragging they don't care if they cheated as long as orange man gone. When we win, imagine their tears. God Bless America
1325264312978579458 2020-11-08 10:30:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Haven't been on much today, cut branches 9 hrs and hauled them over to a big fire pit. Something killed off 9 of my pin oak trees. They're dead and dry, starting a fire now to burn some up. Biden isn't President of America!
1325235285844746240 2020-11-08 08:34:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @M_Doonby65 I live in Texas, my County never had mask mandates or shutdown any businesses. Buffets, movies, bars, never closed, no masks
1325230521392246785 2020-11-08 08:15:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @RobynOC43960540 Texas
1325205866614845440 2020-11-08 06:37:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Life is back to normal, I'm eating in a golden corral buffet, no masks or plexiglass. Baked fish look out I am hungry.
1325179001615355904 2020-11-08 04:51:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> In my County for Potus  209,000 Potus votes, 18,258 for Biden. I need to find these people and get them to move
1325178063844421633 2020-11-08 04:47:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm a hunter
1325161069728456705 2020-11-08 03:39:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrats betrayed the people of America and pissed on our constitution. We know the scum sucking pigs cheated. Biden will never be my president.
1325160478251888640 2020-11-08 03:37:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Very disturbing in my community today,No masks ever, no business close, buffets open. Since yesterday democrats are out in public masked up and face shields. A customer at home depot tryed to tell me I would besafe with a mask.showed him my 44, he left
1325144329229275141 2020-11-08 02:33:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Back later I'm cutting down branches on my property today. If AOC gets her list going while I'm working, someone sign me up.
1325143550896508930 2020-11-08 02:30:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Don't forget in 2000 it took till December 15th for the election to get finalized. Just because the commies are yelling victory, it's not legal yet. They're just continuing the scam
1325141935800119297 2020-11-08 02:23:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Trump flag rallys going on in my town
1325141543490101248 2020-11-08 02:22:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Texas doesn't like it, we don't need the federal govt
1325076530003910658 2020-11-07 22:03:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Watching the libtard streamers last night, they're celebrating a new world order. They think we're trying to cheat and steal the election. They want us to go away so they can save the world. In reality they just hate orange man he's bad
1324935848752766977 2020-11-07 12:44:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter and I are going fishing, caught 6 crappie last night. God Bless America and all you wonderful Patriots. Sounds like we're getting some action on Bidengate. We need voter audit, Goodnight. Jesus Saves completely it's easy

1324914900938989568 2020-11-07 11:21:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Covid over? Are the Christmas masks still a thing? Biden still not in jail for selling our country for money? Are all the fake votes counted yet? MSM still lying to Americans? Are democrats still committing Treason daily?
1324913980478009350 2020-11-07 11:18:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I never dreamed Biden would be on TV pretending to be the president.
1324909133187993600 2020-11-07 10:58:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Awesome
1324907507811291137 2020-11-07 10:52:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> RBG last words were for Biden to get got cheating and for Potus to get 4 more years.
1324907135730376705 2020-11-07 10:50:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @jdrichmond2020 @smalltownvoice Say her name lol
1324906855081136128 2020-11-07 10:49:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Sounds like a good club to be in, won't have to wear a mask
1324906556954206208 2020-11-07 10:48:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Are they not checking for fraudulent votes? If not we need to raise some noise.
1324891141389611009 2020-11-07 09:47:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I will say it again, Democrats are so dumb, they over cheated so much that a child could see it.

1324845237865426946 2020-11-07 06:44:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I  have to go feed my animals, I never told them about masks. My  cattle would want masks that say eat more chicken. Back later, thanks for sharing time with me. God Bless America.
1324843752243036166 2020-11-07 06:38:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have been thinking about plexiglass for my tractor. Don't want the Rona getting me while I'm plowing.
1324843150037438466 2020-11-07 06:36:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Masks were always unnecessary, they knew it and still like to say Wear Your Mask. We see what that did to our country.
1324842120025411585 2020-11-07 06:32:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> How many masks could a masked man make if a masked man could make masks. Catchy?
1324841756547043331 2020-11-07 06:31:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Kids Christmas masks  https://t.co/jcvxsDzPdq
1324841117645524995 2020-11-07 06:28:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I wish I had been in the mask business prior to covid. Talk about rising profits
1324840671421890560 2020-11-07 06:26:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If you folks will just wear your masks two more weeks, we can see the new Christmas line of masks coming out.
1324840289966694410 2020-11-07 06:25:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Think about the millions of gallons of sanitizer sold. We could use it to start campfires
1324839881747632129 2020-11-07 06:23:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They have fashion shows for masks and face shields. If you haven't watched it you should. It's great entertainment.
1324839242174992386 2020-11-07 06:21:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I wonder if the Guinness book of world records has a record for most masks worn at once?
1324838893938769921 2020-11-07 06:19:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> For years to come, every garage sale will have masks for sale
1324838253137199104 2020-11-07 06:17:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> What are we gonna do with all these masks lying around when they admit it's unnecessary? Can't burn them it will cause climate change and kill baby dolphins
1324837640307433472 2020-11-07 06:14:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Two or three years from now kids trick or treating will be wearing those masks as scary costumes
1324837222043029507 2020-11-07 06:13:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> People laughed when I said it but it's true, those paper masks work amazing cutting onions. I have used the same one 30 times at least. Follow me for more tips on masks
1324836682668122114 2020-11-07 06:10:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If I could get a mask like Darth Vader and talk like James Earl Jones, I might wear it a couple of days.
1324836180366688262 2020-11-07 06:08:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When they first said wear the mask for two weeks my daughter bought a box of the toilet paper masks. She brought them to my house wanting me to wear one so Chyna Flu didn't kill me.We put one on and busted out laughing. Still have them for sale cheap
1324835226670026753 2020-11-07 06:05:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> That wearing masks for two weeks was the longest two weeks of my life.
1324834913858789381 2020-11-07 06:03:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm selling invisible masks, been wearing one 8 mths. 100% warranty it works
1324834119780618241 2020-11-07 06:00:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Masks made the Democrat voters dumber due to a lack of oxygen
1324833722156359683 2020-11-07 05:59:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Two weeks ago when they wanted us to wear masks to flatten the curve.  That was over 7 mths ago
1324833162023866368 2020-11-07 05:56:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Masks make perfect sense now in hindsight, if you're a Democrat trying to steal an election
1324832759936880640 2020-11-07 05:55:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Masks started this, stand six feet apart to protect grandma. Wear your mask!
1324832471410712576 2020-11-07 05:54:10 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If I wear a mask while tweeting, they probably wouldn't censor me.
1324832222709534721 2020-11-07 05:53:10 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Do I need to get permission from social media before tweeting a thought?
1324831982224875525 2020-11-07 05:52:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Is this America? This sounds like Russia or China type of elections? Wear your masks two weeks so you won't see the democrats stealing your country

1324790492635238403 2020-11-07 03:07:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @murphy_marita Yea, I shared it last night, disgusting
1324789658652475392 2020-11-07 03:04:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I posted that last video tweet I immediately lost over 500 followers. I'm not validating the tweet, I don't know if it's true. It was shared to me and I RT to see others opinions. Many believe it's possible and many don't. I hope it is, I just want truth.
1324786960712519680 2020-11-07 02:53:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I live were people haven't shutdown or wore masks. I went to a big grocery store to get ribs and coffee. Their was at least 50 dems with Biden masks on. First time in my area.
1324783254382301185 2020-11-07 02:38:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @mrhigginsmom That's why I shared it, but anyone who would be involved wouldn't say anything if it is true. Which I have no idea, it was sent to me by someone else.i hope it's true, but I have no idea if it is, could be bs.

I don't know if it's true, I heard they set the dems up to catch them in the fake ballots. They have tons of stuff on Bidens criminal activity. National guard have been deployed.🙏
1324752038924865539 2020-11-07 00:34:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I saw a video on the war room about it, a supposed intelligence agent said it was a sting operation. Also said the national guard is deployed in many states.
1324745282169569280 2020-11-07 00:07:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrat voters are gullible beyond belief. They fact check and say this  isn't true, they don't realize who is validating their checking, another Democrat is. This crowd of uninformed voters is disturbing, the idea you can trust their sources is ludicrous
1324743906198695936 2020-11-07 00:02:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> MSM is frantically pushing the agenda out to the democrats uninformed voters  https://t.co/i4HsbA8eh3

1324530148767576064 2020-11-06 09:52:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I saw a tweet by one of the hollywierdos, Mark Ruffalo, he said Potus had already lost 3 court cases on the election. He told us to move on with our lives and quit trying to cheat. Do you think they believe we're the cheaters. They are crazy
1324528027653517312 2020-11-06 09:44:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Idrinklibtears1 @SenTedCruz @RepDanCrenshaw @JohnCornyn I emailed him, and left a phone message. I talked with Louie Gohmert on the phone.
1324527409941651457 2020-11-06 09:41:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @DanCrenshawTX Sir, Texas conservatives are disappointed in your lack of public support for Potus. The democrats are destroying our country with a fraudulent election. We expect you to speak out for Potus, Remind the pack we will remember.

1324525327893364736 2020-11-06 09:33:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My friend in the secret service brought me a Christmas ornament off the Clinton's family Christmas tree, with Bill thanking me for my support and signed it. I haven't looked at it in 20 yrs, it's probably cursed.
1324523492327460867 2020-11-06 09:26:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I had a friend who was in the secret service working with Bill Clinton as president. He told me back then that the politicians fighting on TV, we're actually friends off camera. He said both sides were buddies. I'm sure Don and Nancy don't hang.
1324520027060621313 2020-11-06 09:12:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> How do you feel about our voter fraud situation? One of the judges looking is that asshat keeping Flynn tied up. Judge Sullivan, he's not an impartial judge. The cheating is so obvious it's disgraceful for all Americans.
1324518205956775942 2020-11-06 09:05:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @DuckdogWI I actually got the county election official who is conservative to report it. She told me they were told to use paper ballots and sharpie by PA Gov.

1324489531698143239 2020-11-06 07:11:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @flatscreentv She basically eulogized Potus as president
1324489201308569600 2020-11-06 07:10:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @NicolePetrinoSa Basically gave a Trump eulogy
1324485729699901444 2020-11-06 06:56:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @mcvietvet She was on talking and thanking Potus for his work while he was president. Acting as if it was his obituary, no mention of voter fraud, just paying respects
1324484663012954116 2020-11-06 06:52:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Remember their plan went into action when they said wear the masks for 2 weeks to flatten the curve. Ever since they gained control of the people, it all went as planned. A mentally ill man got over 70 MIL votes that hid in a basement.
1324482774938636291 2020-11-06 06:44:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @gr8ful4Liberty Thanked Potus for his past service without mention of what's going on. Acting like it's over
1324482086267441152 2020-11-06 06:41:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The reason we don't trust the election process anymore, is the Democrats changed it to attempt to steal an election.Mail in ballots  and fake pandemics, making healthy Americans wear masks which are unnecessary. All to cover their fraudulent votes

1324387617610354689 2020-11-06 00:26:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They're talking on msm that we need to unite as one. I don't want to unite as one , they're cheating still. We need this election straightened out asap. Honest counts of legitimate votes. Then I will unite, until then we need to fight their criminal activity.
1324386412087726082 2020-11-06 00:21:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrats have nothing but billionaires and the mentally ill. The corruption in this election is criminal.

1324384515595390976 2020-11-06 00:14:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> McConnells staff has said the senate would work with Biden on centrist judges but not radical extremists. If that's true I wish McConnell would've lost, these Republicans are  mostly democrats as well. Only a few are worth a crap.

1324176826982420481 2020-11-05 10:28:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This, my grandkids first day of school pic, caused by Democrats is unforgivable. America is looked up to around the world because of us, the American people. We cannot stand by without being seen and heard. God Bless America and Donald Trump.  https://t.co/noc2YcAc0D
1324175865580822528 2020-11-05 10:25:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's just begun,  fight for justice and a fair election. We must demand it, get other people talking about it. Don't let it go, no complacency, hopefully by Gods  Grace we will overturn their crime against us, And get Potus the 4 yrs they're trying to steal
1324174964744966145 2020-11-05 10:21:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I promise you they were giddy with joy to tell us to wear a mask or else. Most people obeyed, that allowed them to lie about covid for the very scheme they pulled off. Mail in ballots, mailing them out randomly, anyone could fill one out. They did that
1324174192573558784 2020-11-05 10:18:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm not the kind of guy to let someone take my vote away by cheating and not fight back. We're a small portion of the people who were robbed of our votes. They talked about cheating, they openly did it. It's our job to make sure justice is served
1324172359008485376 2020-11-05 10:11:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Tag Potus, let him know we're  still here, we're sticking with him. I will go to the capital and peacefully protest for justice. We need to be seen and heard, I'm getting active tommorow. Let me know if you have ideas for me. I'm not giving. You?
1324171232552591360 2020-11-05 10:06:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They started this plot with the covid crap, then they masked us up like animals and told us what we could and could not do. They plotted the mail in ballots, they're not hiding it, they don't think we will hold them accountable.
1324170309033955328 2020-11-05 10:02:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We got knocked around a little bit, Potus is still fighting. I intend on fighting with him as long as it takes. We can't let this stand, justice has to prevail. If Biden could win a fair election I wouldn't like it, but I would  accept it. He didn't tho
1324169509037629440 2020-11-05 09:59:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm contacting my local republican party office tomorrow. I'm ready for peaceful protest, keep it in the news. All across America, people had their vote not count due to cheating. We can't allow that to stand, we are many, together we are loud.
1324168345692852225 2020-11-05 09:55:10 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Just because these politicians have been acting like gods doesn't make them one. We the people expect fairness and transparency. This plandemic created the opportunity for them to pull this ballot crap off. We're aware of that, lying sacks of crap
1324167246042857472 2020-11-05 09:50:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It aint over unless we let it be over. We're not like them, they start looting and burning. We have rights and our govt owes us a fair election. We must demand justice, nothing less. Keep the story alive, other wise they've won.
1324166277028601857 2020-11-05 09:46:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Let's not sit around and think we can't do anything. Tens of millions of Americans votes were not counted due to cheating. Many are upset, we need to be loud in our demands. We obeyed the law and voted peacefully. I can't let their theft go unchallenged
1324165222173728769 2020-11-05 09:42:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We got cheated on by a party in our govt. It's our duty to bring it all out in the open for all to see. A party that has done more damage to our nation than anything. I'm not forgiving about treasonous acts by govt official from either party.
1324164264832180228 2020-11-05 09:38:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Call, tweet, email, every Republican, let them know what you expect. Most people are in shock, I understand that. We didn't fight this hard to give up now. They want that, Masks make people submissive, we're not weak, we're United for America and Potus.
1324163102045339648 2020-11-05 09:34:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm not gonna just sit here and do nothing, I'm gonna hound every republican politician, till they get off their butts and speak out. Everybody, even the libtards no Potus wins in an honest election.
1324162189633163264 2020-11-05 09:30:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We got time and truth on our side, let's take our election back. No one could complain about a loss in a fair election. These weasels planned and enacted a theft of our election. Americans don't put up with that crap, we have to prevail
1324161268035555329 2020-11-05 09:27:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We didn't lose, they stole it, We need the courts and republican politicians involved. I have messaged 8 Republicans today telling them I expect them to get loud, And call the democrats out for their crime against Americans.
1324160541154299906 2020-11-05 09:24:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I Ain't giving up for nothing, we got involved to make a difference. We still can make a difference, I'm willing to do what I need to support Potus. We will get our election back from these thieves and get Potus 4 yrs more
1324159772262912001 2020-11-05 09:21:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Their will be people who saw the cheating come forward. Guarantee if they just look at the votes the fraud will be huge.
1324159210943356930 2020-11-05 09:18:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We know for certain the democrats cheated, it's so obvious even a liberal Judge could see it. Potus has got the ball rolling, we need justice to start working. If they throw our the fake and multiple votes, Potus will win
1324130743354826753 2020-11-05 07:25:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @CaesarisSum That's what I'm thinking

1324128430888202240 2020-11-05 07:16:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I haven't gave up the fight on here, I'm hanging in till the end. I'm sticking with Potus, I have been busy today trying to replace my daughters hot water heater. It's in the attic, dragging the old out and new in, is an all day job.

1324095161538891781 2020-11-05 05:04:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @TopSportsMind I stated what Newsmax posted, not my opinion theirs. I showed the numbers in Michigan were Trump is ahead

1324081183886626816 2020-11-05 04:08:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> From what I can see without a court getting involved, or cheating being revealed. Biden is gonna hit 270

1323740108336599041 2020-11-04 05:33:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The cure for racism is a clear conservative win. The democrats have kept Americans divided by skin color, beliefs, long enough. It's time to bring America back to one people looking out for each other. God Bless America.

1323434306648375297 2020-11-03 09:18:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ my savior. You?

1323430734539988993 2020-11-03 09:04:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @LindaNDanny @SgWildstyle Pelosi and fienstien both have family on the electoral
1323427194052485120 2020-11-03 08:50:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Pray for America, may God forgive us for allowing our land to murder a fetus as a common daily act. Then we sell their body parts for money to fund more unholy practices. You're either for Christ or you're against him. You decide when you vote.
1323425732228489216 2020-11-03 08:44:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> VA Gov Democrat, stated, we will deliver the baby then wrap it up to keep it comfortable. Then we will talk to the mother to determine if she wishes to abort it at this time. If so they procede to abort a born baby that breathed the air. Vote Trump
1323424352734449668 2020-11-03 08:38:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Any person who claims Jesus Christ as their lord and savior and votes Democrat, has mocked the blood of Christ on the cross. No follower of Christ could support the murder of babies and selling their organs for profit. God Bless America!
1323421175649869826 2020-11-03 08:26:10 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Biden crime spree

1323419499253633024 2020-11-03 08:19:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> 👇👇Magic word, economy.
1323419220403695617 2020-11-03 08:18:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Who elected all these deviants from Hollywood to advise us on how to live. They keep threatening to move, we all sure hope they do. These democrats will start eating each other after Potus gets reelected. Guarantee you these a holes aren't masking.
1323403538832281612 2020-11-03 07:16:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Masks are on the ballot tommorow, masks symbolizes control and division. Vote to be free, never let them take our freedoms again. Vote Trump for freedom.
1323400794671108097 2020-11-03 07:05:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This time tomorrow my daughter and I will be voting Donald Trump to keep America great. The world is watching and counting on us.

1323390204875546624 2020-11-03 06:23:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Masks are unnecessary for covid flu. The flu is real, it is every year. It's another climate change Hoax. The masks are not for covid, they're to create fear and division. They've ( dems &amp; media) have devised our country over an unnecessary mask  https://t.co/U0gKo02vZC
1323388304516128770 2020-11-03 06:15:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> PA folks, do something. A once great state decimated by Democrat regulations. Stop your union alliance crap and vote to make PA great again.

1323376425978732546 2020-11-03 05:28:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Start calling people who are sitting on the sidelines
1323376224475979777 2020-11-03 05:27:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> These very words were spoken by Biden running for dictator of America. Vote
1323374017512955907 2020-11-03 05:18:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The commies are blowing hot air
1323354426648731649 2020-11-03 04:00:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Tens of thousands die every year from the flu, do you remember being afraid of catching it?
1323353651298131968 2020-11-03 03:57:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> From now on every flu season you will be wearing a mask. Unless we take our country back, we've been lazy. Nationwide numbers show democrats vote a much higher number than conservatives on local and state elections. We allowed this to happen
1323351080290426880 2020-11-03 03:47:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Didn't cdc say over 70% of the people who tested positive wore masks at all times.?
1323349855012589570 2020-11-03 03:42:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I haven't seen any bodies lying around. Has your Walmart closed down due to a lack of employees who died of the flu?If masks are working why are they worried about higher positive test numbers. It makes the death rate lower is why. Masks are fear!
1323348153261850626 2020-11-03 03:36:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's simple, the flu is real, just like every flu is. And just like every flu, masks are unnecessary. Why is Bill Gates a climate, one world looney advising us on anything. He gets more air time than the President of America.
1323346484797071366 2020-11-03 03:29:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Remember 3 million are gonna be dead in months from the flu. Masks don't work only for medical people, then they changed it to everyone. Two weeks wear your mask to slow the curve, save grandma. It wouldn't surprise me if they planned the nursing home deaths.
1323345302666072064 2020-11-03 03:24:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When you hear a man running for president talk about kids in elementary school choosing their gender. What person who isn't mentally ill would not be shocked by that? Teaching kids about maturation and anal sex in school.
1323344314852921344 2020-11-03 03:20:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I feel certain Potus is gonna win, it's natural to be nervous due to dealing with corrupt democrats. They're above the law, because they've infiltrated our govt with mentally ill people. I stand behind my mental illness claims. This country is full of them
1323341498268737536 2020-11-03 03:09:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @nhssabine Don't know, it was on Twitter
1323339836141588482 2020-11-03 03:02:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I don't know if any of you saw the video of the lady crying about voting Democrat. She said they sent us a ballot and told us to vote immediately. She then after seeing Biden and learning more info wanted to vote Trump.
1323337554637344770 2020-11-03 02:53:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter and I watched an internet t.v. Show last week that was about tracking and tracing people with a virus. It was a special secret govt force who kidnapped infected people then tracked anyone they had contact with. Believable?
1323328621122113537 2020-11-03 02:18:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I watched a video last night that was like a hypnotic type message. It flashed thousands of faces with masks on, all saying, I wear the mask because. Over and over, all races and ages, it was demonic as you could get.
1323326304788295681 2020-11-03 02:09:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm not ashamed to admit, I voted for Potus in 2016 for tax cuts. I like keeping the money I worked for. I love Texas, no state Tax, and people who live here complain about any tax. I lived in PA and had to pay a tax for having a job.
1323322413933842432 2020-11-03 01:53:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Biden even running with his extremely obvious mental illness is an insult to our country. The fact someone would vote for someone like that is unbelievable. I wouldn't even ride in a car with him driving, yet people are voting for him.
1323320561418862599 2020-11-03 01:46:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Bidens only plan is to kill our energy business, the very thing they used to say was our biggest security threat, dependence on foreign oil. We finally reached energy indepence and they talk about destroying it. We know they can't, the green stuff don't work.
1323319266897264640 2020-11-03 01:41:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's hard to imagine a decent human being voting democrat. I have learned they are the easiest people to manipulate, gang mentality. Uninformed, no free thinkers all run by manipulaters influencing them. Voting for someone with Dimentia.

1323313566435475456 2020-11-03 01:18:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I talked to a small business owner in PA about how Trump tax cuts help him keep more money. He said it wasn't worth it to allow Russia to run our govt. He believes Schiff &amp; Pelosi were threatened by Russia during dem impeachment.

That's a vote against our freedom. All his platforms he's running on are summed up in the mask. Trump2020
1323302196499369990 2020-11-03 00:33:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I followed back someone and naked pics started popping up all over the place. Crazy world

They all have agendas, both sides get the same propaganda pitched to them. I'm voting Trump because I paid less taxes, he creates jobs, he supports all Americans and proved it.
1323120136937680896 2020-11-02 12:29:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's great knowing his last words were reelect Donald Trump.

1323109321056702469 2020-11-02 11:46:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I just saw a Biden commercial stating tax cuts for the middle class. Showed a bunch of busy factory workers, all Hispanic. The democrats will do anything to create division. They hate the idea we might all get along. Tax cuts, Biden lol
1323098494975021056 2020-11-02 11:03:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's getting comedic their reporting it, the fact that they do and people belive them is the part we want to know about. Their in on the mask scare 24/7, talking about killing Grandma. Their trying to divide America, many believe them.

No masks in the building, people picking pizza off the buffet, it hit me that most people aren't doing that. I took a pic and posted it. I haven't went thru that, I don't like seeing it happen.

1322391757997383680 2020-10-31 12:15:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My town the cooks in your restaurant and the waiters don't wear masks. That sounds scary to most people who live in this new normal. Someone cooking and touching your food? Talking face to face, but it is normal and needs to come back.
1322388648948600834 2020-10-31 12:03:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm not trying to force my beliefs on another person's views. I just don't want my govt to pay for Abortions or facilitate it in anyway.Thats why I vote conservative. Plus less taxes,lower crime and jobs.

1322225017481035777 2020-10-31 01:13:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My County, never a mask mandate, no restaurants closed, buffets open. Workers no mask mandate. Today they issued their first covid mandate. No candy for trick or treat can be passed out unless packaged. Lol
1322224121724502016 2020-10-31 01:09:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Just met a women in my daughters store who introduced me to her 39 th month daughter.
1322223481963089920 2020-10-31 01:06:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The part they don't want to mention is, they're not Sick. Now that we know for certain it's no more deadly than any other flu. Silence until people say no more.  https://t.co/w8acGYF2z3
1322217894038654977 2020-10-31 00:44:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @janaforjustice Yes
1322217797976494080 2020-10-31 00:44:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @guitarlots Just normal deaths
1322217579428106246 2020-10-31 00:43:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @BigLuke24 just like any flu, you still catch the flu you're vaccinated for. Supposedly less of a sickness. Immunity to a virus like covid last month's, the same as a flu vaccination. That's why people with existing wait till end of Nov for flu shot, so it lasts
1322215955150364672 2020-10-31 00:37:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @SendHamburgers interesting bio, I'm a hamburger aficionado but yet to juggle chainsaws. You never know tho
1322178439919636483 2020-10-30 22:07:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Watch this if you haven't  they know, Potus knows it's true. Democrats are pushing this for the weak minded to follow.
1322176674243530753 2020-10-30 22:00:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They're no longer conspiracies, they're reality. Masks are to keep us busy so we don't think about the crimes they've committed. If you catch Chyna Flu you can catch it again. Can't you catch any flu again? Nothing else kills anymore, just Chyna Flu.
1322170692729712644 2020-10-30 21:37:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @wolfblitzer He's not a journalist anymore, he's following the information allotted him. Good job, you will get a ribbon to wear on your jacket
1322029363198599169 2020-10-30 12:15:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all you wonderful Patriots. My daughter and I are heading out fishing, it's warming up tonight. Jesus Saved me completely and he will you, Goodnight and pray for America. God Bless you all!
1322028235165782016 2020-10-30 12:11:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @BigLuke24 Of course, these are meant to provoke thought and we all see things differently.
1322027815248736256 2020-10-30 12:09:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If we don't change things, the next election supporting conservatives could be illegal. Masks just seem like the tool to keep us from getting together. It works like a curfew, can't go in or if you can you have to. Sounds like dog training. Masks started it.
1322024784612478976 2020-10-30 11:57:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Remember this is a new idea for 2021 to get newborns acclimated to wearing masks.  https://t.co/OjT8PJOqgp
1322023592843005955 2020-10-30 11:52:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I like going wherever I want, eating out, listening to live music. Talking to people anywhere, going to events. Masks are keeping us from doing that, they're just the symbol that we obey orders. Causes fear and makes you stay home.
1322022553356034048 2020-10-30 11:48:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's believable if we continue on with the unnecessary masks, that we could be buying them for gifts for years. What's the next freedom they want, or do they want them all. If masks was a test run, we're in trouble.
1322021489177223168 2020-10-30 11:44:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We are living in Mad Maxx, Terminator 2, Godzilla type of world right now. Freedom is being challenged worldwide, the world is looking at us. If we fail the world falls, masks will be on your school supply list forever.
1322020215752957952 2020-10-30 11:39:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Last January it wouldn't have entered my mind that people would be told to wear a mask. Told how many people can come to their home for holidays, not allowed to go places. Can't open your business, talk thru plexiglass. Sounds like freedom left
1322018531253329920 2020-10-30 11:32:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Whenever I hear green new deal, that's code for money to these deep state criminals. I wonder if anyone is getting kickback on masks and sanitizer. I would love a half cent on every mask sold wouldn't you.
1322016424903221253 2020-10-30 11:24:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Makes sense to anyone
1322015601234247681 2020-10-30 11:20:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Pandemics are the new climate change.
1322012026059792384 2020-10-30 11:06:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @JanC1776 I'm talking about our top leaders, people who like war, and work with big tech companies to create new weapons.
1322010221405941760 2020-10-30 10:59:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> These deep state people are everywhere. Don't you think covid lies and masks are part of it? I don't trust a large part of our military leaders, they knew this stuff was going on and said nothing. I fear the number of honorable people is a minority
1322006609187475456 2020-10-30 10:45:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Creepy dude and dumb or extremely smart. He did mastermind worldwide money grabs while vice president.
1321989340067696640 2020-10-30 09:36:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @c_r_y__o_u_t I figure he wins, if not look up Jesus is coming.
1321989045422071808 2020-10-30 09:35:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This is true, there is nothing normal about living in fear of the flu. Masks aren't necessary
1321988672787521539 2020-10-30 09:33:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm prepared, as should all people. Pray for peace first

1321969847044104193 2020-10-30 08:19:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The overwhelming answer on whether you're nervous about the election. More worried about the dems cheating, in a fair election a Potus landslide win. And if they pull off that cheat we're having to make decisions on what to do.
1321960762072596482 2020-10-30 07:43:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> All the dem big social media influencers and many dem politicians, are posting. I wear my mask because, then they list the same old Fauci crap

1321944273487626242 2020-10-30 06:37:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm concerned about our youth as well. I'm gonna do me till death no matter what. Our young people need help, this mask wearing is detrimental to their well being

1321917494743871489 2020-10-30 04:51:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They won't be delayed, enough numbers will be in election night to secure the electoral college
1321916594373668867 2020-10-30 04:47:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The Election is about freedom, Freedom to work and live as you chose in a energy independent  America. Remember they always said the biggest threat to our country was dependence on other countries resources. Biden wants to destroy that. Why?

1321884151340011520 2020-10-30 02:38:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Not only no masks, no plexiglass either. You know why? Our county has conservative health officials. They know masks and plexiglass aren't necessary. That's the way they say it here, Not necessary. Instead of they don't work, they're not necessary

1321879177960787968 2020-10-30 02:18:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have lived no mask the whole event. Chinese buffet 2 days a go, today cicis pizza. No workers, no customers with masks. This is a city of 200,000. No mask mandate ever.
1321878516871405570 2020-10-30 02:16:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Some people are letting fear control them. The mask causes fear to spread

1321655706446123009 2020-10-29 11:30:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Living a normal life and sending our kids to school is what we need immediately. To many adults and children are being taught fear.  Masks are bad for everyones mental health, our youth can't take it. Masks aren't necessary.

1321626726972215296 2020-10-29 09:35:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I don't want to die, but I'm not afraid of death. I never wanted to be sick, but it's  part of life and strengthens our immune systems. We need to get sick, it creates warriors in your body to fight more serious sicknesses. Masks don't change anything
1321625435877318658 2020-10-29 09:30:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Masks have to go away, fear has spread so badly that people are afraid if they cough. In the past if you coughed, you said crap I'm getting a cold and went on with your life. People are becoming afraid to be sick, Vaccines are next

1321560646547312644 2020-10-29 05:13:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Wonder why cdc said the majority of people with covid always wore a mask, Then Fauci and democrats want to make it a multi yr mandate to wear a mask. Bill gates said the world population needs cut in half. Culling the herd?

I had to stop at Starbucks, my daughter wanted a pumpkin latte. 8 bucks, I'm not doing that for coffee, I could buy a Democrat politician for that

1321548043582349315 2020-10-29 04:23:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm being punished by Twitter for calling a speaker of the house a turd sucking pig yesterday.
1321547742032863234 2020-10-29 04:21:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm a little disappointed, with millions of people dying from Chyna Flu everyday I still had to park a half mile away from the lumber yard. Maybe it just hasn't reached me yet. It could be that no one wears a mask here. The mask is the killer.
1321546395371917314 2020-10-29 04:16:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I agree
1321498744970498048 2020-10-29 01:07:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Rjrohrbaugh But aren't they given certain protection from liability by our govt. If they're using their pre agreed terms of use only on subjects they disagree with, shouldn't they lose that protective liability. Not following their own rules to manipulate an election.
1321492389261942784 2020-10-29 00:41:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I feel like Twitter separated us pretty good. My feed looks like a ghost town. It could be everyone died from Chyna Flu and we're all that's left. I declare I'm in charge of this part of Texas. Nevermind, I just looked outside, everyone isn't dead

1321269956525379585 2020-10-28 09:58:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I did wear a mask last week to cut onions. Something it actually worked on.

1321268652402970625 2020-10-28 09:52:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @oldriccid I never wear a mask
1321268470974156802 2020-10-28 09:52:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Wearing a mask to stop a virus from getting you, is the same as putting toilet paper in your trunk in case you crap yourself driving your car. It makes no sense, to many people are attached to it like a baby is to a pacifier. We just have to say No.
1321267558729818112 2020-10-28 09:48:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> After the election will we then have the courage to tell them NO more masks. We're, us, The American people are being manipulated like children. When do we stop it, when will we just not do it? Why are we doing it now, it doesn't work
1321265762963726337 2020-10-28 09:41:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Doesn't seem like the land of the free in America today. Hopefully we're still the home of the brave. Stop masking! A dipshit like Chris Cuomo has sway over the weak minded, and he's a punk. Don Lemon is dishing out political advice, unsure he's a man.
1321264129718603779 2020-10-28 09:34:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Now we know why the democrats like masks. Their all robbing us and stealing our money.
1321263481006555138 2020-10-28 09:32:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The idea that a mask prevents a virus from spreading is ridiculous, and they know it. Maybe it's just the initial stage, goggles&amp; mask, face shields, then what? Permission to leave your assigned location. Tracking your every move, the phone in your hand

1321240393015590916 2020-10-28 08:00:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The numbers on covid deaths get lower every day. More people die from the common cold than Chyna Flu
1321238899738480641 2020-10-28 07:54:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> People ain't dying from Chyna Flu! The deaths coming from this failed policy is the real pandemic.  I'm gonna say 220,000 people dying from a fake pandemic is nothing.  No more people died than the yr before. Masks don't work, control does. Obey!

1321227711130574848 2020-10-28 07:10:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> What's next, diapers on our heads. Gloves  are coming soon, no more than 2 per car, one in the back seat. Plexiglass in between, both wearing a mask.
1321226483688497152 2020-10-28 07:05:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Remember, city, county, state, federal are elected by us, we the people. I don't see anything wrong with getting in your local politicians face and reminding him that. If enough people want it they will have to do it. How long are we gonna wait?
1321225088222584835 2020-10-28 06:59:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> History rears it's ugly side
1321224617491660805 2020-10-28 06:57:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I don't want them sending checks out unless they open up the country. Open up, then give folks some help. Don't force us to wear your stinking masks and pay us to go along with it.
1321224075981803523 2020-10-28 06:55:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Facts are right her👇comrade Pelosi killed the deal
1321223410983325698 2020-10-28 06:53:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Why isn't everyone in prison dead?With all the dead bodies lying around how does Walmart stay open? You would think anyone working at a pharmacy would be dead. I forgot, The plexiglass kills the virus. Stop wearing masks.

1321220824028860416 2020-10-28 06:42:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Is Tennessee doing the mask scam? Every year around Thanksgiving I drive to  Nashville to the Opryland hotel to see the Christmas lights and decorations.

1321219082914586626 2020-10-28 06:35:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Remember masks were to protect grandma and grandpa. They don't want you wearing a mask. After the election if your in an area near me that makes you wear masks, invite me, I will come fight the mask war with you
1321217716741677057 2020-10-28 06:30:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Stop saying it's normal now to wear a mask. I understand people wear them at work all day. Never say it feels normal, that's what they want. Hate every second you have to wear that stinking mask!
1321216983548002305 2020-10-28 06:27:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> After the election and Potus wins, I hope we see a revolt on masks. If we don't stop it now, they will have you doing it forever.

1321170393743372292 2020-10-28 03:22:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Just like all of you, we know they're lying in the polls. But we're uncertain of them, they're acting insane. They have committed so many crimes against America. No one's doing anything, I'm not losing hope. Just stating the obvious
1321168733365293060 2020-10-28 03:15:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Pray for America and Potus and all the people of good hearts to rise up.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
1321168326605885442 2020-10-28 03:14:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> After Potus wins, you will not be forced to wear these masks anymore. If you believe in God, cry out to him. Pray that this evil Democrat party is vanquished from any power. Jesus loves his people and hears their cries. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
1321167473962614791 2020-10-28 03:10:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> November 3 rd is our only hope to save this country. Jobs are coming back, opportunity exists like the old days. The democrats will destroy everything, we need the whole ball to lead this country to greatness for all

1320932429511774209 2020-10-27 11:36:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I wonder if the democrats are celebrating a qualified woman being sworn into the supreme court. A woman replaced a woman on the court which is what they wanted. I don't think her being man or woman should be relevant.

1320386369009713152 2020-10-25 23:26:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @SusieGiggles63 Good morning
1320215655824674817 2020-10-25 12:08:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America, and all of you who are fighting for America. Allergies are bad for folks right now. I never had them till I got an immune disease. It's just an annoyance,  Goodnight and pray for America and it's people. Bidens Senile. Sniff sniff
1320214543558184966 2020-10-25 12:04:10 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's supposed to get down to 57 tonight, that's way below Normal. My daughter and I are going to walk around and check the livestock out. Close things up  and keep the wind that's blowing this cold front in. It's gusting 40 right now.
1320211646711795712 2020-10-25 11:52:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Yesterday my daughter and I ate at a Chinese buffet. We talked to a couple laid off from Michigan. They were loving not wearing a mask and eating out with no restrictions. They're visiting kinfolk who moved here. Independents  voting Trump.
1320210415876526080 2020-10-25 11:47:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Agree, Potus loves America and Is  working for everyone. I want everyone to have opportunity and make a living wage. Creating jobs in America is the way to do it. Not thru Democrat handouts. Potus knows how to do it.
1320208316170121217 2020-10-25 11:39:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Yep, we need to get involved in limiting mayors and govenors powers to taking away our rights.
1320203971504578560 2020-10-25 11:22:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Dudes criminal all the way, these people will make our streets dangerous.
1320203300252340225 2020-10-25 11:19:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I forgot he said that, know surprise he's got dimentia.
1320198948817076226 2020-10-25 11:02:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @NancySpinelli9 I wish I had a gas stove for cooking
1320197938002468864 2020-10-25 10:58:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Cmon Man, sniff sniff. You ain't white if you don't vote for corn pop.
1320194349129519104 2020-10-25 10:43:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's a good thing I helped them move in, it had a gas furnace and hot water heater. They was thinking they needed plugged in. Not many homes have gas, electricity is cheap and you don't use a furnace much in Texas. Had a gas fireplace, I unhooked it.
1320192913536667648 2020-10-25 10:38:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @SenSchumer I wish you would stop the politics and work for all Americans to have a better life. I used to be a Democrat 40 yrs, you don't do anything you promise. You just cause obstruction to prevent things that would help all Americans.
1320191893217705989 2020-10-25 10:34:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Just got back from helping a couple move into a house. Had to fix a few things for them, nice home but empty a few years. Their first home, their in the 20 yr range. They gave me this for helping.  https://t.co/wqxBNo3oak
1320033493250957314 2020-10-25 00:04:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I will be busy today, I'm helping a family move. A young couple getting their first home.

1320018531531083777 2020-10-24 23:05:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's no more relevant to me than what size shoes I wear
1320016020552167429 2020-10-24 22:55:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Cmon man

1319842800373010433 2020-10-24 11:26:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Before I leave I want to share the perspective of folks where I live. We never closed, it's increased work in manufacturing significantly. People are working overtime while they can. They will be  big spenders then, money is being made.
1319831996135329797 2020-10-24 10:44:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all you amazing Patriots. My daughter and I are headed to my flooded pasture. It's full of fish, Jesus Saves completely. Goodnight, Pray for America, We're strong United people,We're gonna win!Cmon Man sniff sniff,Bidens Senile.
1319817944092868608 2020-10-24 09:48:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @frenchivory I raise cattle, so I buy lobster
1319813990181179392 2020-10-24 09:32:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Amen
1319813706256179201 2020-10-24 09:31:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I survived covid in April, immune disease and kidney cancer. At 68, I know the flu, that's what it was. I had symptoms and worked my livestock everyday. Not afraid then or now, everytime someones sick they're afraid now.
1319811233277747206 2020-10-24 09:21:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Noelle_Michaels NW

1319810042464526336 2020-10-24 09:16:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Biden supporters are all mentally ill. Cmon man
1319809463382134789 2020-10-24 09:14:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Good for her, I wouldn't want to work for such a sleazy organization.
1319808555218862081 2020-10-24 09:10:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We're gonna win, many of those early voters registered as democrats are voting red. I already ordered a 160. Lobster to celebrate the win. I don't spend money like that for a meal often.
1319807362052558849 2020-10-24 09:06:10 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm going on a 20 state vacation next summer and end up in P A to see my grandkids. Hopefully I will get to meet some of you Patriots.
1319806929703755779 2020-10-24 09:04:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @robin_cashio Yes he is
1319806534201868288 2020-10-24 09:02:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Biden won't ever be my president. I live in Texas, he would be irrelevant. Every time they run they're going to do this n that. Remember they never do those things like green deal, because it won't work and they know it. Dems be lying
1319801864519639041 2020-10-24 08:44:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Yep
1319800024126062593 2020-10-24 08:37:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This is my other acct I got from my daughter in PA. I probably will say stuff in the next few days to lose this one.  https://t.co/k5ZfP4PmMm
1319799163903758336 2020-10-24 08:33:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Flu numbers down, lies about covid. Science shows death rate is nothing, it never was. 220,000 out of 330,000,000. Get your calculator out and do the math. 480,000 die in America every year from cigarettes, didn't shut down for it.
1319798414306136069 2020-10-24 08:30:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Cmon Man, Biden has no skill to lead this country, even Obama stated Joe was a moron. He didn't get anything done in 47 yrs, and now with dimentia, he has it all figured out. So does my 6 yr old grandson, I trust him more than Biden
1319797409413738497 2020-10-24 08:26:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> He’s lying dog faced butt licking pony riding jackass
1319796151894290438 2020-10-24 08:21:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> He's not been right once, I trust a chimp more than him. All the democrats including Biden said we should work with W.H.O. They say open up your country.
1319794969616535552 2020-10-24 08:16:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> He showed his colors
1319794337715281920 2020-10-24 08:14:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I pray to God ALMIGHTY that black Americans join us. Stop the democrats from preaching division. We're all one America  and need to reach out to each other in respect and kindness
1319792878261096448 2020-10-24 08:08:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> People listen to this mans statement. If this continues there will be no jobs. The folks who need govt assistance will be screwed. Democrats will rob your social security for their failed ideas. Wake up, vote for opportunities.
1319784479246909440 2020-10-24 07:35:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Heading to my daughters shop for internet, I'm running out of data and I have a lot to say
1319784083040468993 2020-10-24 07:33:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @debriley1997 11 or 12
1319782041140056064 2020-10-24 07:25:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I lost a lot of followers today, don't know if they got suspended or what happened.
1319781629578141696 2020-10-24 07:23:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrats stop listening to the covid numbers. All science shows it to have a low death rate. Statistically you have a better chance winning a lottery. How's that working. The msm is lying to keep you in line. We're all Americans join us for  jobs
1319780613071699968 2020-10-24 07:19:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrats voting out of hatred for Trump, how can you hate someone you don't know. Because democrats and MSM convinced you to. Remember they all loved and endorsed him to run one day. They didn't know he would expose their crimes
1319778961140887553 2020-10-24 07:13:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrat voters need to stop the anti Trump vote. A vote for Biden puts us back into the Obama Biden yrs. No jobs, no opportunities, regulations that will destroy jobs we have now and cause more to move to China. Vote for jobs, vote Trump
1319777489732894728 2020-10-24 07:07:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The stream that runs thru my pasture into the lake is over the banks. They're fish in my pasture, tonight's fishing will be easy.
1319776581393502208 2020-10-24 07:03:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's winter weather in Texas today, it got down to 67 during these storms. Folks are wearing jackets, I love it.
1319775518242312192 2020-10-24 06:59:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm gonna give respect to the rapper fifty cents. Don't know anything about him or his music. His reason for voting for  Trump is valid. I voted in 2016 for tax cuts, he's voting in 2020 for the same reason. That's American
1319764074188636160 2020-10-24 06:14:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Totally is, Americans in both parties need to wake up.. They're destroying our country. Quit voting against someone and vote for all America. Vote Trump for jobs.
1319759904576516099 2020-10-24 05:57:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm in storms my internet is in and out.
1319759738507317248 2020-10-24 05:56:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Bidens a lying pig faced dog licking  pony rider
1319758691768258560 2020-10-24 05:52:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Biden and the criminal democrats are trying to steal an election. More Patriots than commies, we will make their tears flow. Trump landslide
1319757218615615488 2020-10-24 05:46:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Good question, Because the God less democrats will lie about anything to scare Americans. All science shows covid is weak, 99% survivability for the elderly. Wake up America the news and democrats are lying to you
1319756096815435780 2020-10-24 05:42:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @PMC08040943 12
1319745622052900864 2020-10-24 05:00:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Thank you sir, we must win to save Americans, the left has went socialist
1319745187753721857 2020-10-24 04:59:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Agree, tell the people we have to open up the country. Your welfare checks won't be coming if we're not working
1319744728154443776 2020-10-24 04:57:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrats are committing crimes daily. We will prosecute them after a Trump landslide
1319744203337891841 2020-10-24 04:55:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I am not okay, people aren't dying from it. Democrats are trying to scare people before the election. They're destroying our country and stealing our freedom

1319704418686742534 2020-10-24 02:17:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> All MSM is showing is new covid cases. Their whole strategy is to ramp up the fear. They no Bidens  nuts, it's non stop covid fear. Experts on advising what to do. Chyna Flu.

1319695699718668296 2020-10-24 01:42:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Dishonest? He was a lying dog faced pony soldier. Sniff sniff
1319691120088129536 2020-10-24 01:24:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Biden after the debate: Did I do good? Can I have that cookie now? Who was that guy I was talking to. He made me feel dumb, we going back to the basement. I'm telling my sister Jill that corn pop touched me. Cmon Man!
1319685513599660036 2020-10-24 01:01:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Cmon man

1319678887178194944 2020-10-24 00:35:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It was so obvious Joe ran out of gas
1319647500618399750 2020-10-23 22:30:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's obvious  to anyone with a half a brain  Biden lacks cognitive speech still. I'm sure they juice him up, I'm 68 and I'm listening to him thinking he reminds me of people in their 90s in a nursing home.
1319646523576049664 2020-10-23 22:27:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Nope

Fill him with your healing spirit and mercy and love. Hold all involved in your love, bring peace and wellness. In Jesus name, Amen
1319497292269998081 2020-10-23 12:34:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @gotcha83429259 You live that close to it, you might as well use it. We both love to fish and talk. Sometimes we listen to libtard streamers while fishing  or talk about Jesus.  https://t.co/p7dtWvItnL
1319496325805858816 2020-10-23 12:30:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @john316stonec90 I know the area, same as California, plenty of Patriots. Every state has plenty of Patriots. Texas as a state has split, most big cities are dems. My County 500,000, 1 elected dem County official. Drive 100 miles, it's opposite.
1319495209273655297 2020-10-23 12:25:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America! Glad that biased debate is over. My daughter and I are going fishing for crappie around the boathouse. Jesus Saves completely,it's easy to do. Goodnight and God Bless you all, Bidens Evil, plus he's cray cray.
1319493360458104835 2020-10-23 12:18:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Bidens a scumbag, we know it, he knows, the whole honest normal thinking world knows it.
1319492569819189248 2020-10-23 12:15:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @john316stonec90 Always ready for bbq
1319491560627732480 2020-10-23 12:11:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> He was disingenuous
1319490675419848705 2020-10-23 12:07:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I liked Trump bringing up Bidens family crime syndicate. Both opponents should stick to the truth. Joe did something wrong and he knows he's caught.
1319489716983631873 2020-10-23 12:03:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If you didnt watch Laura Ingraham Wednesday night do it. Listen to that doctor, he had more validity than anyone. Trump won, Bidens lying and killing our energy industry. I can't wait for Pelosi to not be speaker.
1319488218975342593 2020-10-23 11:58:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Yes, awful moderator, she was bias. Why can't democrats be honest. Stop wearing a mask, the libs won't stop first. They're brainwashed. More than you suspect would join you.
1319487362305527810 2020-10-23 11:54:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Alyssa_Milano Nobody that plays the market except the fake green energy companies agree. All run by the Dumbcrats.
1319479066496479233 2020-10-23 11:21:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Truth, dems destroy jobs
1319458591053664256 2020-10-23 10:00:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Agreef
1319443398005227526 2020-10-23 08:59:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Do you think if Biden gets questioned on criminal activity, he will then admit Dimentia and can't remember. Or possibly say he was I'll then and lacked mental capacity for good decisions. Or act like nothing happened.
1319442511962755073 2020-10-23 08:56:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Think they already injected Joe with juice so he can talk during debate.
1319440187567517697 2020-10-23 08:47:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> True

1319046776150773761 2020-10-22 06:43:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> After watching Obama talking in PA, I forgot what a divider he is. He's trying to act knowledgeable by screaming. I'm sure glad he's gone to live with all the rich white folks.
1319045910853275650 2020-10-22 06:40:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Will mask wearing children wear a mask under their trick or treating masks? Will people give out masks for trick or treat? Will people be afraid to answer the door, people are becoming more fearful due to the plandemic. This mask has to stop!
1319034797872787457 2020-10-22 05:56:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @SusieGiggles63 What trial
1319034659280474113 2020-10-22 05:55:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I agree, I loved him and kept waiting &amp; waiting. Still waiting, my opinion of him has changed. They're all trying to cover something except Potus.
1319032283299483649 2020-10-22 05:46:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @JohnSmi52322821 It was scary enough to the point were it got close to a shooting
1319029325509906436 2020-10-22 05:34:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm trying to be careful on posts, many I used to follow are shut down. I badly want to be on here till the election is over. We've all put up with stuff we normally wouldn't due to the election.After the election I'm taking no crap from tards
1319027940882087936 2020-10-22 05:29:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @curtan_john When she gets them carved I will post
1319022732772769793 2020-10-22 05:08:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Got back from Dallas, my daughter put this up at her store. And we're not doing pumpkins. We're doing Trumpkins, she's carving our pumpkins to look like Potus.  https://t.co/48dtJizyUG
1319014456622538760 2020-10-22 04:35:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @murphy_marita These are everywhere  https://t.co/1iy5NzpIwH
1319013480431783937 2020-10-22 04:31:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Truth
1318943660256448512 2020-10-21 23:54:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> On my way to Dallas TX at least 100 vendors on the side of the road selling Trump flags, not a single Biden flag to been seen.
1318774580660428800 2020-10-21 12:42:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Before I go, is anyone else excited they may try to utilize the asteroid story to scare folks. Probably just a day or two so they can deny it. It will still spread fear on those in fear now. Kinda sadistic  isn't it.
1318772677000167424 2020-10-21 12:34:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Most popular sign in my area 3 days running. I guess some people are upset that a vice president helped foreign Govts for money.  https://t.co/sPtbvyMQ7V
1318771604965425152 2020-10-21 12:30:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Remember cdc said mouthwash kills 99.9 % of covid virus. Tommorow the toilet paper wars change to mouthwash. New goggle face shield anticipated release tomorrow by MIT. Can't wait to see that beauty, I read it's a game changer. Supposed to last thru 2021.
1318768200822214656 2020-10-21 12:16:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America, and Thank you amazing Patriots for working for America. My daughter and I are going to play video games tonight. Jesus Saved me completely and he will you,it's easy to do. Goodnight and God Bless, no fishing tonight 😩
1318766945940983809 2020-10-21 12:11:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The democrats remind you of the old Mafia movies. Their more of a Saturday night live type, most of the time. In other words, not funny anymore. They hate anything good, decent, patriotic, kind, generous and especially honesty. Dangerous times
1318765629827067904 2020-10-21 12:06:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @SubduedRadical I'm salivating over it
1318765345071599616 2020-10-21 12:05:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If you would've told me 3 yrs ago the stuff the dems have done to hurt America, I wouldn't have believed it. Today it's the new normal, nothing to see here or anywhere. These folks will do or say anything, organized crime?
1318763603139416064 2020-10-21 11:58:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Won't it be amazing if they lose the house. Pelosi would get so drunk and go on TV saying crazy stuff like she normally does. I laugh everytime I see someone thanking her for working for America. How much do they pay someone to say that about Pelosi.
1318762321246883840 2020-10-21 11:53:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @JessRabid @DeeGeene I agree, I'm certainly not happy she died. Just wasn't a constitutional jurist.
1318759152278188032 2020-10-21 11:40:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @SubduedRadical I agree
1318758813105881089 2020-10-21 11:39:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @DWPatrick831 No, he has worked with him. My son was a huge streamer got married last yr, not big anymore. Manages a Cheesecake factory restaurant.  Half the money he made streaming. It's a 24 hr a day job to prepare, I was on 9 yrs ago on a video with over 5 MIL views.
1318756981121961989 2020-10-21 11:32:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I love small business owners, that covers a kid  mowing lawns to store owners. People who have the skills to turn something into an income. A lot do what they dreamed, others do what works for their situation. That's were I like to buy.
1318755712558878721 2020-10-21 11:27:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I agree, my son is a big streamer. It's a broad spectrum of people and pewdiepie is huge.
1318755067122585601 2020-10-21 11:24:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If I had to chose between firing Pelosi or Schiff, only option one or the other. I would have to think about it. They both are traitors, sneaky in their own ways. They both lie naturally, they're both willing to pull off an outlandish event. Scarves&amp;kneeling
1318753537862586368 2020-10-21 11:18:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It was a patriotic night, God Bless America!
1318751925530169344 2020-10-21 11:12:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Busy day today, had to go to Louisiana for a tractor part. Saw a person masked with multiple masks with rubber bands around their head holding them in place. It's a zoo out there, Democrats trespassed in my yard, mouthwash kills Covid. Bidens Senile.
1318732892520984576 2020-10-21 09:56:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I know it sound callous, I'm glad RBG isn't on the supreme court anymore. She wasn't a hero to me.
1318732065802682368 2020-10-21 09:53:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Think how many things the democrats have ruined. States, cities, police dept,sports, movies, music,The news, TV, Entertainment, Childrens normal lives, stores, restaurant industry, theme parks the family unit, churches, holidays. On &amp; on
1318727359240032257 2020-10-21 09:34:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> AL capone and Bonnie and Clyde were sissies next to the crimes the democrats have committed.
1318726224844292096 2020-10-21 09:30:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Tara Reade deserves justice. They know he assaulted her, they don't care. Hair sniffing, treasonous mentally ill guy. And he's their best for president.
1318725349195321351 2020-10-21 09:26:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's true
1318724365224189952 2020-10-21 09:22:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The reason I have my yard posted no trespassing is when I'm not home I have a German Shepherd in the yard. He was a trained police dog, I keep my baby critters there. You would have a better chance with a crocodile than the dog if I'm not home
1318723382184128512 2020-10-21 09:18:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Asoulfirst Yes, liberal college students
1318720275186319365 2020-10-21 09:06:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm stumped
1318718305700630530 2020-10-21 08:58:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1>  https://t.co/IZ3csID9TY

1318697729728675840 2020-10-21 07:36:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The local democrats were given 24 hrs to gather up their flyers or be fined. They should've fined them, it's against the law for a pizza place to stick flyers on doors. They do it because people throw them down and litter. Texas doesn't mess with litter.
1318696875088924674 2020-10-21 07:33:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Update on the democrats trespassing on my land. Sheriff called says it's a young girl from out of state who trespassed. I started to feel bad until he told me she's from a University in Colorado. I pressed charges, fine 500. Or 3 days in jail.
1318695854333693963 2020-10-21 07:29:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I went to Walmart first time since July. Their is a young lady out front who has the job of offering you a mask. I said good evening to you young lady, she said I'm guessing you don't want a mask. We both laughed, nice girl.shitty job pushing masks here
1318630836917456896 2020-10-21 03:11:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @GreenHammer4 It is the local Democrat party. It's against the law here to put unsolicited flyers on doors. Creates trash, they fine you 100. For everyone they pickup. I'm pressing trespassing chg. They opened my gate, sign, no trespassing. Walked to my door
1318621974562787328 2020-10-21 02:35:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1>  https://t.co/xhMlL4ZSHw
1318612768157728773 2020-10-21 01:59:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have baby goats in my yard. Since democrats trespassed on my property. I want to make sure they didn't molest my goats. They are democrats
1318611319956918275 2020-10-21 01:53:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @JohnBer08534390 I just pressed charges on them for trespassing. They opened my gate and came up to my door and stuck it in my door. 6 neighbors did the same
1318610886689492998 2020-10-21 01:51:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm gonna be busy this afternoon repairing my other tractor. The democrats who opened my gate to come on my property, to put a commie vote sign on my door. 6 of us just pressed charges for trespassing. 2000. Per house fine. Lol
1318609814411501568 2020-10-21 01:47:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> San Antonio is a cesspool, destroyed by a Democrat Mayor. Just go to your local Crack house, same thing. Save money
1318607285749415938 2020-10-21 01:37:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @porche_angel I called the sheriff, I'm pressing charges. They opened my gate and came in my yard. No trespassing on my gate. I got 5 neighbors pressing charges
1318601672407605249 2020-10-21 01:15:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @lynnriley14 They opened the gate to my property which is posted. Just called the sheriffs dept. I'm pressing trespassing charges
1318600480696782848 2020-10-21 01:10:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> , some commie put this on my house.  https://t.co/vLb9NEXrFX
1318576288244944904 2020-10-20 23:34:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I just saw my first 3 masker, I was gonna take a pic. Couldn't stop laughing, had a rubber band around his head to hold all 3 together. Every day is an adventure. I'm in Louisiana
1318400755146100737 2020-10-20 11:56:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all you wonderful Patriots. My daughter and I are going fishing, nght crawlers tonight. She caught a 15 lb last night. Jesus Saves completely,it's easy to do. Goodnight and God Bless. No,to  Masks and shutdowns
1318399848593428480 2020-10-20 11:53:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Anyone that has a bunch of paper masks, in case you missed my earlier post. They work great cutting onions, the juice sucks right in the mask, not your eyes. You can taste the onion, probably sucks any virus up the same way. It isn't waterproof.
1318398865851244544 2020-10-20 11:49:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Wear a mask if it gives you a feeling of safety. The vast majority, except Democrat scientist, say they do not work. It's obvious when cdc said 70% of cases always wore the mask. Strangely, the number of nicotine users was very low.
1318397779958505474 2020-10-20 11:45:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The testing has always been flawed, every week the advice changes. Dems criticized Potus for not following W.H.O. Advice. Now that WHO is saying lock down doesn't work, dems go back to shut down Fauci. Cdc says less than 10,000 covid deaths. Mask?
1318396709584670722 2020-10-20 11:40:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm not being a hot head,I'm not having some one tell me I got to wear a mask. If a store wants to make that their policy, I would shop elsewhere . If the covid wasnt just a flu, and masks actually worked, their could've been a situation I chose to wear it.
1318395443521478658 2020-10-20 11:35:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Ordering us to wear masks is were they crossed the line. Present the facts, which they still haven't, and let us react our own way. Shutting down peoples livelihoods, dems supporting rioting and looting. Attacking police, pandemic bs
1318393705884155907 2020-10-20 11:28:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Voting is a good way to end the mask crap. Democrat states closing down are in financial trouble. People are moving away, they will turn into 3 rd world dumps without help. According to the expert dems and msm, millions should've died already.
1318389929240571906 2020-10-20 11:13:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Dimeolas I know in my part of Texas it's just positive cases. Hospitals have a few in them. No one falling dead in the streets
1318366444736802816 2020-10-20 09:40:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm at my daughters little boutique, I got to help close up. We have signs outside to bring in and tie things down. Every Texan knows a wind storm can come out of nowhere fast. Back later, God Bless.
1318365267735564288 2020-10-20 09:35:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @ArleySpillane He's definitely a commie
1318364942844780546 2020-10-20 09:34:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Give some follows
1318364310855426049 2020-10-20 09:32:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's important that everyone gets to have an opinion in America. Even if I disagree with it, we all don't think alike. But we cannot consider ideas that violate our constitution and Bill of rights. Law and order, respect for others makes America great
1318362860678975490 2020-10-20 09:26:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The dems worked a long term ground game when we weren't paying attention. They got on school boards, city councils, mayors, DAS, any rat hole that they could sneak into. We have to be diligent from now on, every govt position at all levels matter.
1318361624634380290 2020-10-20 09:21:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @JohnBer08534390 Thank you, might be disappointed
1318361068981358593 2020-10-20 09:19:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @minaserrano8 Lol
1318360817365143556 2020-10-20 09:18:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The American spirit is alive again, we're on the right path. Bringing our jobs back is key, I operated a store in PA next to a college 2008 to 2012 taking care of my dying parents. The youth at the college had no hope. 5 suicides of kids I knew.
1318358325646577665 2020-10-20 09:08:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Truth
1318355585423843330 2020-10-20 08:57:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Since Trump became president I could see opportunity coming back to America. You could open a small business in that atmosphere, work hard and make it work. People have pride in America again. Others in the world are rooting for us and Potus.
1318354203832668161 2020-10-20 08:51:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @izzyforAmerica I used one to cut onions, it worked
1318353743356755968 2020-10-20 08:50:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @45Tranquility I saw an agriculture report that China was the biggest importer of American rice.
1318353039867203584 2020-10-20 08:47:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> During Obama Biden administration, I felt like America has seen its better days, I saw steady decline in opportunity and morality. The family as a whole was under attack. Potus has got the plans to bring America back to greatness.
1318351781294899206 2020-10-20 08:42:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Can you believe we sell rice to China? I'm excited we're energy independent. That seems to be a strong national security issue, plus all the jobs for Americans. Potus has done things I didn't think possible. God Bless America!
1318350854596984837 2020-10-20 08:38:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When I attack masks, I'm attacking the fact that the govt doesn't have the right to tell us to wear them. They don't have the right to shut down private business. I'm not attacking those who chose to wear a mask. It's your choice.

1318338058325024768 2020-10-20 07:47:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I try to share as many people's tweets as I can. I remember when I had 200 followers, I was tweeting all day to an empty space. I followed a lot of folks today and I follow back folks who follow me. If you followed me and I haven't FB hit me up.
1318336514519171072 2020-10-20 07:41:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @dougk_sea I agree
1318334119227555840 2020-10-20 07:32:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I watched a video of a Californian asking how the shutdown has affected them. sad stories, very heart breaking. A Biden Harris rich lady was then asked how shutdown affected her. She answered that the hot food bar at whole foods has been closed. In tears
1318332495520256000 2020-10-20 07:25:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> wouldn't it be great if we were all connected for election night. I am so excited to read peoples tweets and hear about celebrations. We have to share everything so we can all enjoy and spread the joy

1318328005677273090 2020-10-20 07:07:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Enough there for a bowling team
1318326170635689984 2020-10-20 07:00:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The democrats try to make it personal when you disagree with any of their psychophants. I don't know Dr Fauci, never shared a pizza with him. I just look at his history and he's wrong about a lot of things. We need better advice from many sources.
1318325103248220160 2020-10-20 06:56:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Maybe it's time to trade in the old car. Remember as the party of science, you should be open to new ideas.
1318323570938961922 2020-10-20 06:50:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This pic was meant to be funny, sadly it shows the truth of how Democrat politicians view our freedoms. The arrogance they have when speaking to their citizens. Do as I tell you,  yet they don't practice what they preach. Cuomo and Deblasio are a disgrace.  https://t.co/HDlfWVpa3s
1318322183937163272 2020-10-20 06:44:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrats support chaos, we know they supported the rioters. Many dem mayors rioted alongside the anarchists. They allowed them to destroy small businesses, a families livelihood. I never thought I would see elected officials rioting in America.
1318317596383629312 2020-10-20 06:26:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I will never support a group who attacks the Blue. I sleep better at night knowing they're out there doing their jobs. I like seeing them patrol my neighborhood. They save lives daily regardless of your belief about them. God Bless Law Enforcement
1318311228004048897 2020-10-20 06:01:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> With my immune disease I was used as a prop to teach new Drs how to diagnose rare immune diseases. If I went to a hospital, it was a circus. I noticed the affluent drs had little interest in learning. A top pitt university  Dr told me American Drs are lazy.
1318309777861128193 2020-10-20 05:55:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> 7 yrs ago I was fighting cdc and fda over my immune disease caused by a medicine. I wasn't after money, I was trying to get them to take action. Some of the top Drs in the world were involved. I learned then that most American Drs quit educating on new info.

1318308191579537414 2020-10-20 05:49:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I remember when you kept your politics to yourself. When I was young in a rural community, politicians came to town and talked with the people. My dad would take all of us kids, he asked them questions. Each person voted without influence

1318280036684910592 2020-10-20 03:57:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The climate gods will be angry for being smart enough to clear your forests. Sssshhhhhrrrriiiieeeeekkkkkkkk!
1318277997460393991 2020-10-20 03:49:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> At any other time in our history, the events the democrats have orchestrated and treasonous crimes they committed  would be a Nuclear bomb of Crime. Today, it's just the democrats.

1318266478559436802 2020-10-20 03:03:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's about Democrats

1318263834675728387 2020-10-20 02:52:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @dianne772agent My County only has 1 Democrat elected official.
1318261942050562050 2020-10-20 02:45:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If we learn anything from Chyna Flu, Learn to not elect Govenors who are eager to take your rights away. I'm advocating my state pass a law forbidding it to happen. Speak to your local representative, It's a priority voting issue!
1318260188051329025 2020-10-20 02:38:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> What's gonna happen to all those masks they're Making? I say each community has a bonfire and burns them. Sing our national anthem as they burn. We will then celebrate our freedom from Tyrannical Govenors. God Bless America!

1318225743231524866 2020-10-20 00:21:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Callling Dr Fauci! The flu has been cured by covid. The 480,000 Americans who die every year from cigarettes have been saved. Covid is better than penicillin for curing sickness.

1317981734827425793 2020-10-19 08:11:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I am close friends with many black conservatives. Most had to leave their church, are their other black conservatives who experience harassment for turning conservative on here?

Living in freedom and safety of Texas all their lives. Big house, kids all went to college. Voting Biden. It makes no sense

1317923968448385024 2020-10-19 04:22:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I forgot to share this shield, designed for executives. It empowers you and sets you apart with the look of confidence and prosperity?  https://t.co/sgcizQfVw4

1317916499294695424 2020-10-19 03:52:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Republicanmama2 It worked well
1317915440715280385 2020-10-19 03:48:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's not just masks, they hate us because we love freedom. We love America and what it stands for. They don't, and they despise us and want our way of life gone. Masks are the beginning, I fear after the election many dem states will continue.
1317913962764263425 2020-10-19 03:42:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @1CowboyUnderGod I can't mention, I did once and we got visited by crazies. Fortunately I go no where without my 44. My daughter is armed and a Crack shooter as well

1317907101629489152 2020-10-19 03:15:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughters small boutique is hurting for sales. We could make ladies jeweled masks. We're not going to, I'm a capitalist. My daughter and I are not helping the agenda.
1317906165158785024 2020-10-19 03:11:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I understand some of you live in areas of nazi dem mask  enforcement. I live 100 miles from Dallas our stores are packed with Dallas shoppers not wearing mask. Walmart tryed it here 1 day, empty building. Next day no mask, business was back
1317904401009463297 2020-10-19 03:04:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My whole point of all these images is simple. They are never gonna say to stop wearing something. Only we can stop it, I don't wear one ever, no intentions. How about you?
1317903624912146435 2020-10-19 03:01:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> You can order family matching shields or mix it up for fun  https://t.co/YliiprsDuw

1317892907752357895 2020-10-19 02:18:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> All the new push is shields, in case people believe masks don't work. Plan 2 shields work, let's try shields for 15 days to slow the spread
1317892368327151616 2020-10-19 02:16:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I watched a video of a couple with shields on that said happy New year 2021, kissing by rubbing shields together. Only 15 days
1317891790847041537 2020-10-19 02:14:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Every company has face masks and shields for sale. Every pro sport&amp; college sports, toy makers. If it's going away why are Easter and memorial day masks on sale  https://t.co/tjB2ZKea7G

1317887664041971713 2020-10-19 01:57:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Obamas involved he's a traitor, he knows about all of the crimes. He will spin it all over media that it's all desperate conspiracies by Russia to keep honest Joe out of office. Democrats will be building altars to worship him.
1317886595538821121 2020-10-19 01:53:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> No way Is Biden debating Potus after his son pointed out that papa Joe Biden is a traitor.
1317886158425280512 2020-10-19 01:51:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Obama is going to be out parading around reminding everyone it's racist to disagree with him.
1317884742973427713 2020-10-19 01:46:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I found a new use for the mask, I wore one last night cutting onions. No eye burn, check back for more tips on things the mask actually work on. Masks don't stop viruses, only idiots and brainwashed, or  people afraid due to nazi msm Gaslighting.
1317883580396281863 2020-10-19 01:41:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm a proud American who supports anyones right to vote for whoever they want. This time is different, all truth is censored by MSM, media,foreign money. The Democrat party is now willingly selling our election to those hoping to destroy our freedoms.
1317881282945220613 2020-10-19 01:32:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When this is over and Potus wins, we will come to investigate the criminal media and dem politicians will be exposed for being traitors against America
1317880305164890114 2020-10-19 01:28:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They've sold out America, Any other time in history they would've been dragged thru the streets to prison as traitors
1317846563042066435 2020-10-18 23:14:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have been listening to liberal streamers for awhile. They're starting to say things about Antifa that sounds like build up to saying Antifa are Trump supporters. It's not shocking for them to say it, they say what ever and libtards believe it.
1317839128961089536 2020-10-18 22:45:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Yep
1317680253783937024 2020-10-18 12:13:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Goodnight, don't forget the dems will try anything. They have zero shame of their actions. Their plans are obvious and dumb. You got to give them credit on their acting skills. Wear scarves and kneel, that's my favorite one.
1317679410275901440 2020-10-18 12:10:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Before I leave, my daughter said maybe Bidens faking or being drugged to look like he has dimentia. That way they won't prosecute him if he loses. But if he wins he will throw it all away and be an evil dictator. Possible?
1317677944488271877 2020-10-18 12:04:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all you wonderful Patriots.

1317638286790316047 2020-10-18 09:27:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I will make a list soon of some of the libtard streamers we listen to. Most is comedy at its best, last night one was yelling, mom when's supper gonna be ready. He's 33, some of them are crazy, others dangerous, I like to keep up with their thinking.
1317636454470852608 2020-10-18 09:19:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @hecate5points I remember as well
1317636014526050309 2020-10-18 09:18:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I shared that info because I'm always with my daughter. I'm at her shop right now waiting to go eat. I'm a man of faith and live a wonderful life. I go fishing 300 nights a yr, my daughter and I play video games. We listen to libtard streamers at night.

I'm eating there tommorow, tonight we're going to the parks and eat off the food trucks. These food trucks have chefs and make crazy food. Eat in the park with over a thousand folks.

1317627512734797824 2020-10-18 08:44:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Do you think these Democrat politicians shutting business down and making you wear a mask are obeying their rules? I don't, they're sipping champagne in celebration of gaining control. Free America, vote out a Democrat, it's that easy.

1317614154660958209 2020-10-18 07:51:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Living in Texas I always felt our neighbors from Mexico were welcome to come work. My experience has been positive, hard working folks trying to feed families just like us. In my area many businesses are Mexican ran and owned. I don't support open borders.

Destroy the country from within. Put your mask on, then think about it. Every country has emp to knock out the grid.
1317611598031323137 2020-10-18 07:40:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We need smaller govt, less politicians. We the people should vote for our states laws. Federal govt shouldn't regulate states.  The constitution are the rules and should not be violated.
1317610685472309249 2020-10-18 07:37:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @hecate5points They can't beat us in a war, we have nukes in bombers all around them. Their people won't fight either, just like Iraq. People oppressed want their regimes overthrown. Chinese people want freedom, they know we will fight
1317608477993349123 2020-10-18 07:28:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Energy independent for the first time. That means security and keeps are work and money at home. Democrats don't like that, they will kill the jobs and back to buying oil from enemies.
1317607294306340867 2020-10-18 07:23:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @hecate5points Easy fix, everyone ate. Going out to clean stalls later
1317606823374082048 2020-10-18 07:22:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Barr chickened out, to long we've been saying give him time. Times up, Do something now.
1317606222246404096 2020-10-18 07:19:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Obama is coming out to remind black folks he's in charge. He's not running for president, lying crooked Joe Biden is. The party of racism, Obama will be preaching division and racism. America would be one if these democrats didn't manipulate folks.
1317605163327229952 2020-10-18 07:15:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Share the truth, Wake up to the mask scam. It's the flu
1317604811483787264 2020-10-18 07:14:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrat politicians encouraged lawlessness.
1317604326550941696 2020-10-18 07:12:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They she'd their blood for America and freedom
1317552830379708416 2020-10-18 03:47:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have livestock to tend to and more fence repair. I had a breakout last night on my Angus. God Bless, back later.
1317552151078502401 2020-10-18 03:44:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrats controlled the chaos till they saw the negative. Then they shut it down
1317548762923995136 2020-10-18 03:31:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @icecube May our lord and savior guide you in your decisions. Fight on Brother!
1317546072315744256 2020-10-18 03:20:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Remember this song? Red, yellow, black or white. They are precious in his sight. Jesus loves the children of the world. Racism is not of God, it is Satans work. Division as the democrats promote is the work of Satan. God bless America!
1317543650574929922 2020-10-18 03:10:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The word of God says, you're either for him? Or you are for Satan. You must decide whose side you're on. If you hate Trump, you still no what the Democrats stand for. And it isn't God!
1317542292429901824 2020-10-18 03:05:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Heavenly Father I pray for all who have seen your word this day. That they would open their hearts and see what Jesus did for all who call on his name. I Pray that all followers of Jesus would rise up and see the truth of the Democrat agenda. Amen
1317536485126569984 2020-10-18 02:42:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I am not ashamed of the Gospel, for it is the power of God to salvation for all who believe. Democrats despise Christianity, they mock Jesus on TV, movies. They have taken gods word from our children. A vote for Biden is a vote against Jesus. Truth!
1317533603362897922 2020-10-18 02:31:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Who took God out of our schools? Who mocks God and his word? Who is allowing children in California to be sexual? Biden left God out of our pledge of allegiance. Democrats mock God and his followers. They laugh at and hate Christians!
1317532212162629632 2020-10-18 02:25:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Christian Brothers and sisters, I implore you, Search the word of God before you vote. Do you support the slaughter of babies? Is pedophilia okay? Is allowing children to choose a gender okay? Churches are closed by Democrats, Gods house!
1317530472008851457 2020-10-18 02:18:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This election to a true follower of Jesus our savior, is between Satan and our lord. Your vote shows your faith, Biden stated on TV an 8 yr old could determine gender? Does that sound like Jesus or Satan. Ask yourself that question.
1317528444767436800 2020-10-18 02:10:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @SaneSeeker I'm saying those who fear man above God lack faith

1317527096038752267 2020-10-18 02:05:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If you are a believer in Jesus as your lord and savior, Why are you afraid and wearing a mask? Aren't the hairs on your head counted, won't he take care of you as he does the sparrow? Did he go to prepare a place for you? Who are you trusting in?
1317525815215738882 2020-10-18 02:00:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> No Christian who knows the word of God. I repeat, knows gods word, Could vote Democrat. To do so would go against everything they profess about our savior. Does any Christian believe Jesus would support killing babies, if not, you can't vote Democrat
1317524885330104321 2020-10-18 01:56:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm buying life jackets, The liberal tears are gonna be deep. No thinking rationale adult could vote for a Democrat. Unfortunately we have a lot of mentally ill people in our country.
1317523851320778757 2020-10-18 01:52:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If this mask crap keeps going on, toilet paper is going to be more valuable than gold. If I were a Democrat, an sure Biden is going to win. I would sell everything I own and invest in toilet paper.
1317523026154487809 2020-10-18 01:49:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We have a bunch of criminals in the Democrat party including Biden and his mob family. The dem voter is blinded by their hate for Trump. It's up to us to save our country, The whole world supports us.Trump landslide 2020

1317312481019166721 2020-10-17 11:52:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I got gas an hour ago, I'm pumping gas and see the guy beside me pumping gas. So I give him a Texas howdy, he looks over, he's probably 30s, suit, worked out. Biden mask on, I busted up laughing. Salesman from Kentucky. He said Louisville, looked scared.

1317309111835512832 2020-10-17 11:39:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's insane the amount of masks for sale online. Every clothing designer has fancy ones. These morons are definitely counting on masks being the new normal. All over the world people are making them and selling them. Great Christmas gifts?
1317307735076163584 2020-10-17 11:33:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The mask and goggles is what they're suggesting. You can get them in a package deal. Order early, libtards will buy them up.
1317307040692424707 2020-10-17 11:30:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Last one, they're are millions of masks for sell. In January will get to see all the 2021 masks  https://t.co/xZLpyk3q7o

Maybe 2 more years, cancel Thanksgiving, small groups kill, wait for vaccine. CDC, mask more effective than a vaccine?

1316891904303198208 2020-10-16 08:01:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Don't forget to turn on NBC to help Potus ratings beat sleepy Joe.
1316888303476637697 2020-10-16 07:46:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Check your follows, I unfollowed people mysteriously. I lost followers as well.
1316886656134369282 2020-10-16 07:40:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I watched Emperor Fauci on a video saying small gatherings are the reason for covid surge. Check liberal news,all saying small gatherings. What next, isolation. These people are nuts. Open up America, stop wearing toilet paper on your face. It don't work.
1316885582887477248 2020-10-16 07:36:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Do you know why black American population isn't growing? Planned parenthood is why.
1316884793083219969 2020-10-16 07:32:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> a black man I spoke to two months ago. A California liberal who moved to Texas. Nice guy, only knew dem lies.

1316883346899816454 2020-10-16 07:27:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Bidens hiding, Trumps thumping on the campaign trail. Potus is working his butt off to get the message out. I wish I could go to a rally, the energy seems amazing.

1316588975952408581 2020-10-15 11:57:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Someone on her attacked me months ago for attacking mask mandates. They said the chinese people have been wearing them for years and they're okay. That's messed up thinking
1316587703736119296 2020-10-15 11:52:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @wizzy_roman Their are a lot of people making big money from covid. Walmart and Amazon don't want it to end. All social media ad revenue is thru the roof. Wall Street is playing money games, businesses got money and still open. Don't have to pay money back.
1316586086794227715 2020-10-15 11:45:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I know many people who come in my daughters shop who work in medical. Most say I'm used to it and can even sleep wearing it. They say it's just normal now. I hate hearing that, don't you? It's disturbing how fast we get brain washed.
1316585209018671104 2020-10-15 11:42:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Dallas TX still has a mask thing going on. Democrat mayor, last time I was there most people had them around their chin. So they're getting tired of it.
1316583750772371458 2020-10-15 11:36:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Talking to my brother today, he works in the medical field with special needs. During this whole covid event he received an extra 8. Per hr plus 4000.00 a month extra pay. He likes the shut down, got a new Harley and car out of it.
1316582164171980802 2020-10-15 11:30:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Went to Walmart this evening, I needed a Halloween mask. Went in and no one was there. Covid killed them all, they're around covid every day. Just kidding they didn't know anyone either.
1316554128051654659 2020-10-15 09:38:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Think face masks will be over after the election?
1316532815153033218 2020-10-15 08:14:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's hard to believe no dems in congress have spoke up about Biden being incompetent. They're many ex military in the dem congress, you would think love of country would come in to play.

1316519910059671556 2020-10-15 07:23:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Crazy times indeed, A party, the democrats committed a crime.

No consequences for democrats, they committed a crime then impeached the president for the crime they did.

1316419944863723522 2020-10-15 00:45:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This morning driving to home depot I saw about 100 cars with giant Trump flags on them. They were Latinos for Trump.
1316419181512986627 2020-10-15 00:42:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The buffets were open, most served you may thru July. That ended and you serve yourself again. Corporate businesses doing a nationwide mask mandate learned immediately that their business would lose its customers. They quit enforcing long ago
1316418006076055552 2020-10-15 00:38:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My County also had 155 deaths labeled as covid. This week they announced 6 people were actual covid deaths. My County is over 400,000 people.
1316417313701343232 2020-10-15 00:35:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My County never had a mask mandate or a shutdown. The people working in stores protected by the virus killing plexiglass had to wear masks. That was lifted today.

Not staying late, unless they're biting. Goodnight, Jesus Saves completely,it's easy to do.  Caught 3 small ones last night. Tasted good at supper.
1316230477896876033 2020-10-14 12:12:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @TX_Justus Thanks, hadn't been paying attention. If I post like I used to, they shut me down partially 3 days everytime. I want to be on here election night.
1316229675425898497 2020-10-14 12:09:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> According to the cdc 36 million smoke cigarettes. They say also 16 million of them suffer from a smoking illness. The kinda illness that shortens your life drastically. You never hear that on the news, 200,000 dead, cigarettes killed 480,000
1316226697814044672 2020-10-14 11:57:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We're all just ready to get this election over with. The house and the senate. I don't know the house and senate seat battles very well. To many scenarios could be coming. Except Potus, and I want both houses.
1316224935631650816 2020-10-14 11:50:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Agreed
1316220911478018048 2020-10-14 11:34:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> people telling you what you can and cannot do is getting old fast. Most people I fear are just used to it and ignore it. I don't listen but it's still irratating. That cannot be a new normal, I hate that term as well. I'm tired of being told anything,
1316219076491071488 2020-10-14 11:27:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My neighbor posted this sign months ago. Now he see hundreds of them.  https://t.co/C0rYFb0zdN
1316217506948841472 2020-10-14 11:21:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If the stuff the democrats have done wasn't happening to us, it would make a heck of a movie. We got Treason, people without any morals or decency in them. People who thirst for complete power, they hate anyone who disagrees. TDS is real.
1316215898093563905 2020-10-14 11:14:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Every time I  get upset by the dems, I always think back to when they wore those scarves and kneeled. That makes me laugh every time I think it f it. Nadler couldn't kneel, just stood there like  boob. They're so full of you know  https://t.co/0pqZUPmQqS
1316212807604543488 2020-10-14 11:02:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I can't get it out of my head the way these Democrat politicians treat us like children. At least 10 ass hole democrats a day post on Twitter, wear your mask. I wish I could tell them face to face my answer. We need to stop that crap.
1316208374837633024 2020-10-14 10:45:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @RayPendergast01 It was my opinion that we need to get there somehow. But I posted it to here other opinions. Thanks for sharing yours, and I agree with the validity of it. It's the power positions that concern me. Look what Schiff did
1316206153148362752 2020-10-14 10:36:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The Democrat politicians were always goofy, They're totally insane right now. We need term limits so badly to save our way of life. Govenors have way to much power over the people and business. We should be voting on our states laws for emergency powers.
1316153098252046337 2020-10-14 07:05:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @wolfblitzer finally a display of journalism questioning speaker Pelosi. Sadly she dismissed you as a lackey for daring to question her. Good job none the less, first honest questioning you've done since you sold out to fake news

1316141414137372673 2020-10-14 06:19:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Nope, and I'm sick of seeing him giving advice.

1316134697580322817 2020-10-14 05:52:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Me either, we the people need these Democrat deviants removed from advisory of any kind. We know they're selling out our freedoms
1316131332372787216 2020-10-14 05:38:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Going to be worse next year

1316099000781733889 2020-10-14 03:30:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Govenors acting like dictators, they, and we forgot we elect them to work for us. Govenors powers need to be limited. I want to vote on any decions my govt makes. Govenors are just like us, when did politicians become gods?

1316043682278244354 2020-10-13 23:50:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I will be working at the homeless camp again today. Yesterday the kids beat me on a mud pie throwing contest. Today I brought 2 totes of water balloons. Back later, God Bless America
1315879240081039360 2020-10-13 12:57:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all you amazing Patriots. My daughter and I are fishing  now, she caught a small one I'm striking out. Jesus Saves completely,it's easy to do. Tommorow I work the homeless camp again. Goodnight, Bidens Senile!
1315857156806250496 2020-10-13 11:29:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When I was a Democrat I didn't know what was going on with govt corruption. both parties are guilty, Trump isn't. That's what dem voters missed, he's not part of the govt insiders. He isn't messing up their little scams. He's for us, why they hate him
1315831894441971712 2020-10-13 09:49:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The msm wearing their little diapers on their faces while on TV. Afterwards laughing about it, I don't believe Chris Cuomo had covid. How could he? He was an obedient mask wearer.
1315829724153815041 2020-10-13 09:40:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm trying to be careful on my posts. I don't like it at all, I have a lot to say. The democrats are a party of criminals, pedophiles and traitors. That's not an untrue statement. Every type of perversion and deviant supports their Anti America policies.
1315828545839681536 2020-10-13 09:35:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> He's so full of crap, go home, we don't want you in Texas
1315825921006473221 2020-10-13 09:25:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I wonder if the people voting for Biden know or care that he has dimentia. Do they believe he threatened foriegn Govts to get money for his son and other family members. Do they care about his documented racist past. Or just msm sheep.
1315824024107196416 2020-10-13 09:17:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @CountryWga Research showed nicotine users had a way lower instance with covid. Nicotine prevented the bonding of covid with your T cells
1315822675386937345 2020-10-13 09:12:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Why would they? 200,000 is all that died. 480,000 cigarette smokers died in the same time. We didn't wear masks or shutdown. Thanks to democrats dependency on the tobacco tax money. Take Cuomo &amp; wolf's nursing home murders out, it's less.

1315388126559432712 2020-10-12 04:25:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Do you think these Democrat politicians are the ones who were standing at airports in the 60s&amp;70s calling troops coming home baby killers?  Remember that?
1315386592706654208 2020-10-12 04:19:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Is it just me or does the two weeks to slow the spread seem like years ago. If I had to wear a mask I would've went crazier by now. I'm so upset by kids wearing masks and being taught to be afraid of people. I despise democrats using children.

1315383778169192454 2020-10-12 04:08:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I remember months ago, my daughter in PA wasn't allowed to be out at night without proof she was coming from work.
1315382523833221126 2020-10-12 04:03:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When did it happen that govenors of states could break federal law. Has it always been in their power to shut down private business? Have they always had the authority to make you stay home? I can't remember this happening before, can you?

1315319807672283137 2020-10-11 23:54:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> So, positive cases means nothing. Only a little over 200,000 people died of covid related deaths. Less than 10,000 died of covid. Stop lying you piece of crap. Open up America!

1315110007155888133 2020-10-11 10:00:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm going out with my daughter to  the park to hit up the food trucks. I want to try a sandwich that uses two big portabellas as a bun. I saw it the other night stuffed with spinach, ham and Feta cheese. God Bless, back later
1315108486456520704 2020-10-11 09:54:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm not trying to preach, I'm ready and prepared for the next step. I want to vote in an honest election and trust we will win. If we win, Americans win. Our families, kids, grandkids and those not born yet. Our country needs us to get out the vote.
1315107420297981954 2020-10-11 09:50:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> There is rioting in many places in America tonight. Democrats, athletes, celebrities, are threatening civil war if Potus wins. Democrat politicians have done the most treasonous acts in our history. We the people will win the day, God willing.
1315106054099947522 2020-10-11 09:44:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I love this country and what it stands for, America is the land of liberty. I don't want to give up anyone of my liberties, I want less govt interference. I want safety and opportunity for all. We  are a  generous people, God has she'd his grace upon us.
1315103298207256576 2020-10-11 09:33:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This is the most important election in the history of the world. The globalist like our Democrat party, are active worldwide. It's not happening just here, the world is under siege.  The world is watching America.
1315101874551427072 2020-10-11 09:28:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I will cast my vote for the future of America and the free world on election night for Donald Trump. We must take control of the house and keep the senate. God willing,enough Patriots vote overwhelmingly to send a message to the world.
1315100897735737344 2020-10-11 09:24:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrats are beyond corruption, they hate America and those who love our country. It's not the same old political party games we've seen for years. This is different, it's demonic,full of hate for anything good. They want us to fail as a country.
1315099622017302531 2020-10-11 09:19:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Americans acting hateful, full of evil, lacking empathy. Have you noticed these people have no care about their fellow Americans. They truly hoped the president would die of covid. Pelosi and dem congress are not acting anymore, theyre full of hate.
1315098257463406597 2020-10-11 09:13:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> America as a country will not be the same if Potus isn't re elected. I don't think the Democrat voter realizes what their party has turned into. All MSM is lies and propaganda influencing division amongst Americans. Traitorous!
1315097160283754496 2020-10-11 09:09:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have been reflecting on the last 4 yrs and find myself not recognizing America anymore. We've watched democrats burn businesses and police stations. Democrat mayors along with rioters attacking police. Politicians encouraging it.

1315003520807034880 2020-10-11 02:57:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Every December my dad would get my family together and tell us about pearl harbor. He worked in a tire factory, he told us how the day after, that people left there jobs and families to go defend America. I can see his face as tho it was yesterday.
1315001893689720840 2020-10-11 02:50:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They're many Democrats who follow me. We comment on each other's posts. They're telling me their belief and I'm sharing mine. Every night I talk in dm to Democrat voters. Am I winning any over? I don't know, I'm gonna keep trying

1314996906490310656 2020-10-11 02:31:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Truth
1314996734263791620 2020-10-11 02:30:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When we as conservatives disagree with each other respectfully, that's what makes America great. Democrats tend to shout you down or make excuses for their actions. Every person is responsible for their actions. We know right from wrong.
1314995174146273282 2020-10-11 02:24:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I never block anyone for a different opinion than mine. I thank everybody every day for listening to my ramblings. I don't expect everyone to agree with me. That doesn't mean we're on opposite teams. Many conservatives attack me, that's okay, respect!
1314993418410614790 2020-10-11 02:17:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @SekcjaSzyfrow I agree
1314991460840865792 2020-10-11 02:09:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @RuskyDusky58 @vickie_lock I disagree, the excuse of being uninformed doesn't justify making the wrong choices.  I never block another opinion, Your arrogance is more on display than an opinion.
1314988056395554816 2020-10-11 01:55:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Texas a red state, no income taxes. Texas is the cornerstone of conservatism. Jobs everywhere, opportunity for all. Democrat mayors in our cities shut down big economies. Our govenor is in danger of losing his job. Because he didn't stop it.
1314985933297639424 2020-10-11 01:47:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The greatest American presidents in my life were JFK, Reagan, Trump. They all put America first, All Americans. They created equal opportunity for all Americans.  They love this country and that's what makes everyone in the world want to come here. Freedom!
1314984646975918088 2020-10-11 01:42:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Untrue! We're not supporters of commie bush, A disgrace to Texas is what he is. He's a Democrat, always was. His dad was a globalist, part of the one world order. We're  conservatives who believe in opportunity for all. Safety, America first!
1314983365054001153 2020-10-11 01:37:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Have you ever heard a Democrat scream, over a half million Americans die every year from cigarettes. No, because they make billions of revenue off those deaths.  We've murdered enough black babies to create Los Angeles. Democrats support this.
1314981943885418497 2020-10-11 01:31:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Your death is determined by the lack of your heart beating. Life begins when a heart starts beating. You can spin it anyway you want, womens rights, her body. It's still murder, abortion is a racist agenda. The majority of Abortions are black Americans
1314976249773776897 2020-10-11 01:09:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Open America up! The damage the democrats have caused mentally to Americans is a crime. They did it in attempt to destroy our nations economy for election purposes. Our nation will suffer decades for their crime against Americans.
1314974925879377920 2020-10-11 01:03:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The fact that only 200,000 died of covid related illness makes it a minor cause of death. Cigarettes kill 480,000 Americans every year, you can buy them everywhere. You don't even need a mask to buy them. Open America!
1314972960185352193 2020-10-11 00:55:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They're just positive cases, let me straighten it out for you. Only a little over 200,000 people died from covid related deaths. That's amazing considering millions were supposed to die immediately. We kicked covid butt. Open America
1314971787055243264 2020-10-11 00:51:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @NBA we will not have a bunch of rich people lecture us. Your sport will die due to your political stance. We don't watch sports to be involved in your players personal political views.
1314970833463451649 2020-10-11 00:47:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Imagine this incompetent man is the best the democrats have.
1314970562830237696 2020-10-11 00:46:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @NYGovCuomo You are a bad govenor who made poor decisions causing the death of nursing home patients. You should be fired, I hope your voters wake up and get rid of you. You lack intelligence proven by your policies.
1314969636430118914 2020-10-11 00:42:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If the democrats plans work, why are the blue states the highest welfare states. When you have jobs, democrats over tax and steal your money. I'm complaining in a Red state that gas is 1.62. How much in your blue state. We have no state income tax
1314968634884788227 2020-10-11 00:38:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Biden running for president is the biggest Hoax ever. How could anyone vote for someone who is clearly suffering mental illness. The democrats mock our country by running him and our whole system of govt. It's a disgrace and abusive to him
1314964480397377536 2020-10-11 00:22:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Anyone voting Democrat is either uninformed, watching msm for daily lies, mentally ill, criminals or stupid. Vote for jobs and lower taxes not chaos and no jobs with higher taxes. Biden Harris sets our prosperity back decades.
1314963666459078656 2020-10-11 00:19:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The mayors in these Democrat cities allowing their towns to be terrorized should be in jail. The mayors either encouraged the destruction or participated in the destruction. Law and order everywhere is necessary for a society to survive. Walk away
1314962696962551808 2020-10-11 00:15:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I was a Democrat till 2013, Obama, Biden policies of regulation and shipping our jobs to other countries woke me up. Taxes, job killers thru over regulations, create racism for political power. Lies &amp; deceit is their platform.
1314961668653428736 2020-10-11 00:11:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Praise God for opening the eyes of these Americans
1314960742538506240 2020-10-11 00:07:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Biden is the epitome of racism
1314764575296942081 2020-10-10 11:07:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @CanteevS I know, my neighbor of 35 yrs told me his church 95% same. Typical divisional policies. Thanks for pointing that out.
1314758420432670720 2020-10-10 10:43:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter and I are at the park. Food truck night, roasted corn and shrimp on a stick . we're living fancy tonight, I might even get a bottled water. Back later, God Bless.
1314741822099513345 2020-10-10 09:37:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Glescagal74 Yep
1314740167379488768 2020-10-10 09:30:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm Proud to be American, people worldwide want to come to our nation for freedom. Our freedom is under attack by this Democrat party more than anytime in our history.
1314739581225439232 2020-10-10 09:28:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm a believer in Jesus Christ as my lord and savior. When I hear someone claim Christianity and are voting Democrat, what Bible do they read?
1314739113090846720 2020-10-10 09:26:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I worked in tactical air assault, medivac, sea air rescue. I think of the wounded and dead vets I saw daily. I wonder how they would feel about these American hating democrats.
1314738432070094849 2020-10-10 09:24:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Veteran brothers and sisters, What say you about Veterans supporting an Anti America Democrat party?
1314737699325124608 2020-10-10 09:21:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> There is no truth in the media or the Democrat party. All our forms of media speech is controlled by socialists. All our information and our education system is controlled by socialists. They all hate Donald Trump and America.
1314736695313563648 2020-10-10 09:17:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The supposed party of science keeps spewing 200,000 dead from covid. Deaths are down compared to last year, cdc says less than 10,000 died of covid. They're convinced a piece of toilet paper on your face will save them.
1314734954451030017 2020-10-10 09:10:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Our country is being overrun by evil twisted people. Is this the new normal? Dem voters aren't voting on issues just hate fueled by fake news and evil dem politicians.
1314734109210677258 2020-10-10 09:06:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Sleazy Hollywood pedos, racist rich athletes, tech giants, rioters, mentally ill people. This is the majority of their party, it's true. People who hate America and what it stands for, they're weak and easily controlled.
1314733319041560577 2020-10-10 09:03:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I saw another traitor vet with vets against Trump  jump on my post before I blocked him. I wish they would not tell anyone they are veterans. To vote for a party that gave over 100 bil to Iran doesn't sound very patriotic.
1314732526846521346 2020-10-10 09:00:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The dems pool of talent must be poor, or people without a record of crime don't exist in their party. A weaker person than Joe Biden would be hard to find. Ask Corn pop or the little girls who got sniffed. Or the ones he's coming for in 4 yrs.
1314731513548865537 2020-10-10 08:56:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> No one even knows what the Democrat party is running on. They declare something one day then deny it the next day. They have nothing to offer and people are going to vote for them. American voters supporting dems have to be nuts.
1314730805621596161 2020-10-10 08:53:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Pelosi and Schiff are poster children for mental illness. Yet they hold two of our top govt positions. Scarier yet is that people support them. These folks are messed up, we're living in bizzare times my friends.
1314730055696867328 2020-10-10 08:50:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Do you think Biden wears a diaper? I bet he does. All them drugs they inject into him to get a few cognitive minutes out of him can't be good. What's his wife up to? Shouldn't she be protecting him from this abuse.
1314729200352481283 2020-10-10 08:47:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> What are the democrats doing running someone who is Senile for president? It's excepted now, it's the new norm that someone who can't put together a cognitive thought can run for president. The world knows, even dem voters know.
1314728491439579136 2020-10-10 08:44:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Does anything these insane democrats do seem even the slightest bit in the best interest of America?
1314723812185985024 2020-10-10 08:25:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @AirPrepper I'm in a big Texas refinery area  it just went up an hour ago.
1314723592798691328 2020-10-10 08:25:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @marycjoyce2 @Cointuckeywind1 We don't have a winter blend in Texas
1314720482701312015 2020-10-10 08:12:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Gasoline is up today $1.62 per gal. That's a good sign that Texas oil is pumping again.
1314705882886926336 2020-10-10 07:14:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @bobbr177 @IHearTheShofar You will be okay, I had it with an immune disease and cancer. Don't let the fear take over, I had breathing issues for 7 days, praying for you. Stay strong.
1314698723465850882 2020-10-10 06:46:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @EnochMann5 @Cointuckeywind1 Just because we have a different opinion brother doesn't make it a lie.
1314697912836816897 2020-10-10 06:43:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @bigmack600 @tshoe12 My area 115 deaths, but they're saying only 6 covid. Population 240,000.
1314680602709426181 2020-10-10 05:34:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They're 33 people excited about Biden Harris coming to town lol
1314678879697723398 2020-10-10 05:27:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Agreed
1314678724709830659 2020-10-10 05:26:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Ha,ha a drive in event? Is there room for 4 cars
1314648696613732352 2020-10-10 03:27:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @LindaK5165 I'm in East Texas
1314632550468464642 2020-10-10 02:23:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @phil_denton I'm prepared for that one, and hauling 26 voters to the polls. Folks who didn't vote in 2016
1314631351417688066 2020-10-10 02:18:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My feed all day has maybe 35 posts on it. I'm seeing very little, if I try to tweet it says try again over and over. It won't let me retweet hardly anything.
1314629127270469638 2020-10-10 02:09:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Busy most of the day preparing for the storm coming. It's going to be 100 miles east of me it seems. I learned long ago to never trust the weatherman on these type storms. Katrina cost me a barn and large property damage.
1314620248033816577 2020-10-10 01:34:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @ChristensonSher @liquidlaugh Me to
1314611314304655361 2020-10-10 00:58:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's not near that close, We don't take polls. I have done 3, I always say I'm voting Biden. My daughter searches for polls all day to say she's voting Biden. Texas will stay Red.
1314609449500323842 2020-10-10 00:51:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Pelosi must go! She's done more damage to our country than any speaker of the house in my life. Her own district she represents has enough crap on the streets to start a fertilizer business. #PelosiMustGo
1314607901974069248 2020-10-10 00:45:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @suspendthis13 @OcrazioCornPop That would be great
1314412076765454336 2020-10-09 11:47:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all you wonderful Patriots. Storms are coming, so my daughter and I are going fishing early. Jesus Saves completely,it's easy. Goodnight, Pray for America and all Americans. Trump landslide 2020, lib tears!

1314364564302106626 2020-10-09 08:38:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Agreed, I want to vote
1314364417795121152 2020-10-09 08:37:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I agree, no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus

1314340458244513800 2020-10-09 07:02:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Sailor02011957 Had it in a back holster
1314339397169565696 2020-10-09 06:58:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I was in Louisiana this morning picking up a starter for one of my tractors. A man walked up to me angrily and said by not wearing a mask I was endangering others. I was 20 ft away from anyone, I told him he's endangering his self coming near me. Triggered
1314336849251442689 2020-10-09 06:48:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If they were the majority, this country would be broken in 4 yrs. Democrats love China money coming their way. They would send more money to Iran, a country who has sworn to destroy us. No Christian could vote Democrat. Only the godless.
1314334759796060162 2020-10-09 06:40:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Potus knows if we had a honest media it would be praising all hes  done for America and the world.They truly hoped he would die from covid, they're angry he had a speedy recovery.  There is no love in them, just evil and hatred with a lust for power.
1314332739924037633 2020-10-09 06:31:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Tech giants, MSM, deep state, pedophiles and sex traffickers, democrats, anarchists, mentally ill, evil,criminals,uninformed, easily manipulated. This is what the Democrat parties weapons are. Our votes in mass numbers must out weigh these deviants.
1314331254461018113 2020-10-09 06:26:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I saw a post earlier from a woman who was a former Bernie supporter. She also followed and believed msm until she went to a Trump rally. She realized the lies and deceit they spew. She's now voting Trump2020!
1314330367655059458 2020-10-09 06:22:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> MSM is full of hateful UnAmerican people, it's like they're from another dimension. Satan most assuredly is their God, there is no good in them. Lies, deceit, contempt for the truth and their viewers. Journalism on msm is dead.
1314329389186908160 2020-10-09 06:18:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If you followed me and I didn't follow back, please let me know.
1314328911484944386 2020-10-09 06:16:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When you look at msm it's disgusting, they're not a news channel at all. Their whole existence is centered around attacking the president with lies and misinformation.Nothing else is on but Trump attacks, it should be called Democrat party news&amp; lies.
1314268957965254657 2020-10-09 02:18:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Yep
1314268662493306880 2020-10-09 02:17:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Ohh Jimmy you commie, we want criminal politicians from either party to be brought to trial
1314067640319606787 2020-10-08 12:58:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Daveon79060069 @JoeBiden Democrat govenors and mayors are not protecting their citizens. Good point, they should be arrested. Let's hope they get voted out for the safety of their citizens
1314066777870082048 2020-10-08 12:55:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @chameul13 BLM is not a racial issue, it's strictly a Democrat strong arm to promote racism. You know to keep the nation divided.
1314065032909590528 2020-10-08 12:48:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @rebob7 @Aloha2Trump @realDonaldTrump Makes sense to me, keep local and state out of it.
1314064540695498755 2020-10-08 12:46:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @sweetmak @CathyMAGA1 Congrats, a dependable employee is the most valuable employee.
1314063405783842819 2020-10-08 12:41:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @hamp2879 I'm a movie nut for sure, I'm not watching anything from elitist ass holes telling me how to live. They hate America and disrespect our president, let alone pedophilia. I don't watch their shows for them to have a public platform for their politics.

Fracking isn't what it was 20 yrs ago. I always believe in enforcing expectations.  I have many years in the industry, it's climate change talk.

Look what that Democrat mayor has done to Dallas, all the businesses that will be lost. Plano is a beautiful place. It used to be farm land
1314044562273374214 2020-10-08 11:26:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @WilliamsHcq What was your opinion on the debate?
1314044182512762880 2020-10-08 11:25:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @JayInslee What a pompous failed politician you are, this is hideous. Surely a blind chimp would be more suitable for your position.
1314017648460664835 2020-10-08 09:39:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> That statement is what makes our vote more important. Trust the American people
1314014121390735360 2020-10-08 09:25:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @PinkLemAde1 You know I disagree, but you also know I support your right to vote as you feel is best for you.

1314012342435434501 2020-10-08 09:18:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Pence just laid it out, we trust the American people to make their own decisions. That's what I want to hear.
1314011477058125824 2020-10-08 09:15:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> There is a famous sweet onion called a Noonday onion. Grown in a rural Texas area, nothing but farms in soil we call black gumbo. People worldwide bought those onions. The last farm 135 yrs old is now a housing development.

1313998053418954757 2020-10-08 08:22:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Unfortunately more liberals came than conservatives, especially Houston which is a TX dem stronghold. All conservatives are welcome, we don't need the others.

1313993167373570048 2020-10-08 08:02:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I spoke to a real estate friend of mine at the coffee shop this morning, he told me every realtor in the county is flooded with west coasters trying to move here. My friend sold his farm for 13 MIL to a California home developer. 28 acres land on a lake
1313991041398321161 2020-10-08 07:54:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They're no elected democrats in my County.
1313989043135315970 2020-10-08 07:46:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Texas made it unconstitutional to have a state income tax. And people will vote for democrats?

1313980656121196553 2020-10-08 07:12:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's a disgrace, that people living in socialist countries are warning us about what the Democrats offer. People are dumb enough to vote for the chaos and moral depravity the democrats offer.

1313977349264871424 2020-10-08 06:59:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Last night I was watching news all over the world. I suggest you check it out. People all over the world are having their lives destroyed by socialist,just like our democrats. They are protesting holding our flag, chanting for Trump.
1313975983482040320 2020-10-08 06:54:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Joe Biden is a lying pony faced dog licker.

1313972537903247360 2020-10-08 06:40:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Because people who love America and Potus want to hear from him.
1313972091977445378 2020-10-08 06:38:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If you could ask Potus one question, what would you ask him?  A lady just asked me that, I can't narrow down to one.

1313890428547207174 2020-10-08 01:14:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Do you think Pence Harris debate has any relevance to the election?
1313889822474407942 2020-10-08 01:11:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @RayPendergast01 True, they believe conservatives are making it up. I talked to a wonderful older black couple the other night. They believe all the rioting is caused by Trump supporters attacking peaceful protesters. I tryed to educate, mind already made up.
1313888646618062848 2020-10-08 01:07:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @RayPendergast01 It's odd in my area, extremely high average incomes compared to the cost of living. Mostly everyone is prosperous, they are taking for granted where they live. They don't conceive or believe that dem controlled areas are different.
1313883930790113281 2020-10-08 00:48:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm still talking to young people about voting in my area, but I'm singing to the choir. In my part of Texas the only Biden Harris supporters is in the black community. Way less Biden signs than any other dem election.
1313881587017232390 2020-10-08 00:39:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> As a believer in Jesus Christ as my lord and savior, if the dems would win. Look up for thy redemption draweth nigh.

1313863635500961793 2020-10-07 23:27:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have been way less aggressive on my posts the last two weeks. They were shutting me down every other day, so I post less and stay away from hot topics. It's to close to the election, I want to be on here election night to celebrate liberal tears.
1313862631204311042 2020-10-07 23:23:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Most of my posts from yesterday were taken down. They were all truthful, I did suffer a larger than usual libtard attacks. If you put up truth they will take it down quicker than speculation tweets. What an odd way to run a media site.

1313636215296528385 2020-10-07 08:24:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The democrats lack any shred of decency. They're smarter than us, just ask them. They know everyone is a racist, uneducated, we're cultish, deplorable hillbillies and are not capable of making our own decisions. They're a godless lying group of socialists.
1313632485373358081 2020-10-07 08:09:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My whole point on bringing up race is,its not an issue with Americans. They're bad people in all groups of folks, that doesn't effect the way you view other people. The democrats would have you believe we all hate each other. Not True!
1313631249429340160 2020-10-07 08:04:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @DianeGunty @Shelzy33 Sorry about that.
1313630875645603841 2020-10-07 08:03:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I wish Mark Cuban would leave Texas and go back to PA were he came from.
1313629239795683329 2020-10-07 07:56:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> 90% of everything I buy is from family businesses. I know them, I make it a habit to know them. I haven't been in Walmart more than 2 times in the last year. I go to a local coffee shop everyday, I buy my groceries from a local grocery store.
1313627307576373250 2020-10-07 07:48:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @SandraD16296927 Amen
1313626723095896066 2020-10-07 07:46:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I want to thank all women for being women. We need their perspective on issues and decisions. I thank all the grandmas, mothers, daughters, wives, sisters for all they do. Which is anything in America, shelf stocker, nurse, Dr, teacher and mothers.
1313625245656514560 2020-10-07 07:40:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm afraid to mention the Mexican man who helps me with my rose business. Or my black neighbor who helps me cut firewood. And I frequent a Chinese sushi house run by migrants from Cambodia. He thinks and preaches division. We're alright without you joe
1313623801117241346 2020-10-07 07:34:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> What is it with Biden always mentioning black people in a demeaning way. Does he not realize no matter what color your skin is we all have jobs in all fields of work. My kidney Dr is black, My mechanic is Hispanic. Is that what he wants?
1313616895829061632 2020-10-07 07:07:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I would personally like to thank all the Black women for stocking shelves. I want to thank all the Hispanic women for  making tortillas and all the Asian women for making sushi. Thanks to all the white women for? Biden got in my head.

1313554836495962113 2020-10-07 03:00:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Today will be spent insulating my palm trees. Took a break, time to get back to work.

1313288792497893376 2020-10-06 09:23:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> You sir are full of horse poop, we can read 200, 000 people died, do the math.480,000 die in America yrly from smoking. Dems are tax collectors of death for big tobacco.
1313287857512099841 2020-10-06 09:19:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Amen
1313286548893380608 2020-10-06 09:14:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Remember when everyone was just Americans? Now we got black Americans, Mexican Americans, Hispanic Americans, Chinese Americans and on and on. How bout just Americans, why do you put down your skin color on everything? So dems can use you.
1313285256863244288 2020-10-06 09:09:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Read that, Chinas rise isn't our demise. That tells you everything you need to know. Chopsticks Joe is sushi cheffing money back to the family. What an UnAmerican thing to say.
1313284185537343488 2020-10-06 09:05:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Listen to this freak
1313284037377695747 2020-10-06 09:04:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Great entertainment tho, they know they have lost the election.
1313283766740299776 2020-10-06 09:03:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Mr Fake news loves being a Loooser. His tears bring me joy, how bout you? Tool of the year award goes toooo. You guessed it Jimmy the tool man Acosta. AKA douchebag
1313280282980745217 2020-10-06 08:49:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Let's break that 200,000 deaths down. 10 % of 330 MIL = 33 MIL. 5% would be 16.5 MIL. 2.5 % = 8 MIL. 1% 4 MIL.half a percent = 2 MIL. You know the rest. The chance of dying from the fake 200,000 is mighty slim. I'm buying a lottery ticket, better chance
1313278242237878274 2020-10-06 08:41:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Potus kicked Covids Butt! So did I with an immune disease and cancer. 200,000 deaths from covid is small. Millions dead by June, remember, and because it didn't happen they claim masks. Any lie that keeps the story afloat. Open America fully!

1313272018104651776 2020-10-06 08:17:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Biden is the scarecrow, Pelosi the witch, Schumer the tin man and Schiff is a flying monkey with Nadler being Toto.
1313271500091334657 2020-10-06 08:14:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The democrats are running on nothing, no plans other than the earth is flat and climate change. Conservatives offer shutting China down and bringing our manufacturing jobs home. It makes you wonder if democrats have jobs
1313269093844295680 2020-10-06 08:05:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Pelosi, Schiff, Schumer, Biden, msm all lying traitors. any other time in our history they would at least be in jail. I'm also sick of seeing veterans for Biden, PTSD? No one who served and loved this country would vote for him. Traitors attract traitors
1313267532996935682 2020-10-06 07:59:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Think when the libtards say 200,000 of your friends and family died from covid. Over 90 % of America don't know anyone who died from covid. 480,000 die every year from cigarettes. Don't hear dem tobacco tax collectors mention that.
1313266868896051207 2020-10-06 07:56:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When Biden said he was able to stay home due to black women working so he could. What a retarded thing to say, to bring race up in every issue  is insulting. How bout hard working Americans are getting the job done.
1313265857922035712 2020-10-06 07:52:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I don't like the idea that the democrats who are not in power have any say in anything. We don't need hearings on supreme court justice, let's have a senate vote. Let us all remember to message the rhinos before voting.
1313262774731059202 2020-10-06 07:40:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We wish you wouldn't report at all. We prefer the truth not fake news. Get an honest job

1312784649991659521 2020-10-05 00:00:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm against abortion and because of that I don't want my tax money going to abortion. It's a free country for you to decide for yourself, just don't expect me to pay for it. Govt should not be in the abortion business, it's become a money maker for dems.
1312778827337261056 2020-10-04 23:37:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Any believer in Jesus Christ as their lord and savior, who studies the word of God, knows the democrats are possessed by evil spirits. They're so godless that they hate Christians and the word of God. Anyone claiming Jesus&amp; voting for abortion is lost.

1312566711854551040 2020-10-04 09:34:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Fauci says we have to hunker down till late spring. He's talking shutting down in a sneaky tone. I say No! Each person is responsible for themselves. Stay home locked up if you choose.

1312544053871902722 2020-10-04 08:04:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrat run cities and states are purposely turning their areas into 3rd world looking countries. And people in those states still vote Democrat. They hate Texas, jobs everywhere, safety, except in dem run cities. There is a pattern of what they offer, Chaos

1312511381225177088 2020-10-04 05:54:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When I got involved with the ecig shop owners to help them fight fake news. You learn American heart, lungs, cancer, AMA are all for sale. They all supported ecigs till Bloomberg donated money to buy ads attacking ecigs. Why? He has an ecig coming to market
1312508890672631808 2020-10-04 05:44:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Think of the irony of covid, cigarettes killed more than twice the amount of people in America than covid. You can buy them everywhere, that's okay because dem states make big money off cigarettes. You will never hear them condemn cigarettes.
1312507713587343360 2020-10-04 05:39:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm a supporter, it saved my life. It's all fake news on ecigs paid for by tobacco and pharma. All our charaties are sleazy as well, they all supported ecigs until tobacco and pharma paid them off.
1312506114810896386 2020-10-04 05:33:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @dosepoet Quit smoking cigs 9 yrs ago using one. Everyone I know I got to use them. They work, I know they do and most drs support them privately. Not publicly because all our health orgs are funded by big tobacco and pharma.
1312505055635927040 2020-10-04 05:29:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Tobacco kills more than twice the Americans every yr than covid. Fact check me, 480,000 in America alone die yearly from cigarettes. Ecigs help stop cigarette smoking. Every dem including Biden said no to ecigs. Big tobacco money funds them&amp; cdc&amp; fda
1312504115293904896 2020-10-04 05:25:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When my daughter and I got our positive covid tests, we were over it before we got the results. We waited 12 days from when I got headaches and shortness of breath, went back for test. Took 9 days to get negative results.
1312495095984189440 2020-10-04 04:49:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> And deaths on these killers dropped drastically during covid🤔could our dems and media be lying? Yes they are.
1312494392318464001 2020-10-04 04:47:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> covid bs, it killed people. Just like the flu, pneumonia, emphysema, asthma, diabetes, heart disease and cigarettes kill 480,000 Americans every year.  Cigarettes kill more people in America and worldwide than covid. Deaths down to last yr.

1312108945406750721 2020-10-03 03:15:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I stopped at a man's house yesterday, he was in a lawn chair in his front yard. I got out to ask him for an address I was looking for. He stopped me 30 yrs away and told me he didn't want covid from me. He had a Biden Harris bumper sticker.
1312106684009988096 2020-10-03 03:06:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> By electing Trump we voted in a person who was not a career politician. If the dem voters would wake up, they would realize it.  The establishment dems and rhinos want to discredit anyone that's not part of their system. They lose power and can be replaced.

1311760235682504705 2020-10-02 04:09:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The problem with covid is everyone has been manipulated into thinking death when they hear positive test numbers. It still has above a 99% survivability. Is this the future for flu and cold season. Or after the election back to normal?

1311496624057720833 2020-10-01 10:42:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Potus deserves the house and the senate. Then we can wean out the rhinos. We got to many weasels in the hen house.

1311433043157151745 2020-10-01 06:29:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @JayleneMarie7 When you're used to it being over a hundred degrees and it drops to the 60s. It's the same effect as a kid growing up in PA going from 70s to 30s. The trees start changing colors in the low 80S. If it's a bad winter we could get 10 days around 40
1311428453653241856 2020-10-01 06:11:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Busy today getting everything on the farm ready for winter. It got down in the 60s last nite, todays high was only 84. In another couple weeks it will be in the mid 70s in the day and low 60s at night. Seeding cereal grass all day today.

1310434884071157761 2020-09-28 12:23:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all you wonderful Americans. My daughter and I are going fishing, we did good last night. Jesus Saves, I say it every night because it's true, and easy. Goodnight, the next couple days are intense. Goodnight and Bidens lying
1310425641616113664 2020-09-28 11:46:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm so proud of my daughter. She told me yesterday in Dallas that she could tell the difference between a conservative and a Democrat. Back home we only know 2 democrats. It was the anger and supeority complex they have. It's True.
1310423099817549824 2020-09-28 11:36:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I am really happy I quit watching or checking scores on any pro sport. It's less stressful, most folks get a little irritated if the team is sucking. I have had more time to do chores and fishing. I don't miss it at all
1310421599741509632 2020-09-28 11:30:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Busy day today, has some neighbors over for supper and gossip. Cool day today 86 high, leaves are starting to change on many of the trees. Grass still growing daily, dems are still going crazy over ACB. Big debate coming up, probably watch the NBA
1310389337943683072 2020-09-28 09:22:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I hate all the bad reps the Democrat party and Biden speak to endanger our police. People that protect us from criminals and save lives daily while putting their lives on the line. Takes special people to do it. #DefendTheBlue
1310367663860920323 2020-09-28 07:56:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> No, it's the opposite of this guy's thinking  https://t.co/ffoZ2h4CFn
1310367235463053313 2020-09-28 07:54:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Bam pow!
1310366169694703616 2020-09-28 07:50:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Tonipatriotbabe @paulsperry_ @SantaSurfing17 @VincentCrypt46 @cjtruth @JuliansRum @DWUSA2020 @MajorPatriot I don't have any secret advice, if you tag me I will try to share
1310323353216049152 2020-09-28 05:00:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm getting the off for a little bit, I have 8 kids from the neighborhood who want to pet my horses. Maybe I can trick them into cleaning out their stalls.
1310317893595340802 2020-09-28 04:38:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> As an older country guy I'm really tired of hearing how racist I am by liberals.
1310311436590120961 2020-09-28 04:12:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm never going to stop talking about racism. My grandkids didn't know about it till the democrats forced it down their throats.
1310309311093104640 2020-09-28 04:04:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I listen to white radical liberals who stream, mostly for laughs. They were so crazy over Aunt Jemima and uncle Ben, They would've tryed to harm them if they could've. The white liberal is a dangerous godless beast.
1310306575169576962 2020-09-28 03:53:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm sitting with my neighbor of 35 yrs showing him this cancel culture crap on aunt Jemima and uncle Ben. He's black, he said he missed the racism part. He's conservative and laughing very hard about it, as am I. Sadly it's true
1310305087546429440 2020-09-28 03:47:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Do you think black Americans are upset about Aunt Jemima being on a box? I don't, the democrats just told people they should be offended. I don't know about you, but uncle Ben looked like the kinda guy you would like to talk to.
1310301860885037056 2020-09-28 03:34:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Aunt Jemima was a comforting picture on a box. She looked like someones grandma who made good food. Now she's the symbolism of hatred and injustice. I used to eat frosted flakes because of Tony the Tiger, have they canceled him yet?
1310300427540459522 2020-09-28 03:29:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @AC_Classof86 Yep, Racism, division,control. It's all they have.

1310294287234596864 2020-09-28 03:04:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When will most Americans wake up to the term systemic racism. It's not true, if you believe it you're guilty of it. The dems have been telling black and Hispanic Americans that their whole lives. Say it enough it must be true,
1310286273706364930 2020-09-28 02:32:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> ACB, the use of these initials are forbidden by liberals. They're going crazy over it. RBG I'm guessing copyrighted using initials in the supreme court. Or was that her 2 ND dying wish? Say her name, #ACBreplacesRBG
1310285108637827076 2020-09-28 02:28:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Uncle Bens Rice! Say his name!

1310278234504921091 2020-09-28 02:00:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Who cares what she wished, I wished for a whale as a pet once. Stop lying she didn't say that.
1310268872449294336 2020-09-28 01:23:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Have you noticed every crime committed by a white person is labeled a white supremacist
1310266872592560128 2020-09-28 01:15:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Alyssa_Milano Thank you for always speaking out. People with common sense realize it's best for America to believe the opposite of you. You've done a lot to secure Potus win, thank you.
1310266142024437762 2020-09-28 01:12:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @NFL Americans don't watch sports that attack our nation. Move to China

1310074068113199118 2020-09-27 12:29:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @ewarren Yes sound deranged when you lie, which is quite often. Remember how you lied claiming to be American native and used it to get jobs. Then you admitted that lie, let's admit it again. You can do it.
1310063380099727361 2020-09-27 11:47:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Dems after Barr, you know Barr did nothing illegal. They know he's onto their game. He's accused them of a coup  https://t.co/OzyOaUwCB2

We're heading to a situation were black Americans are being taught there is no consequences to actions. If a black person robs you it's okay? Black Americans don't think that, dems do.

1309342034642296834 2020-09-25 12:00:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The people who follow the dems are troubled people and uninformed people. They keep themselves in a hateful environment and lack empathy. If only they knew we want it to be better for all Americans. They've been indoctrinated for hatred.

1309337296324431875 2020-09-25 11:41:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The whole BLM movement,along with systemic racism is a democrat tool to manipulate chaos.The democrats have never kept a promise or had a good idea since Potus took office. They just want absolute power and they rob and steal.
1309336150578991104 2020-09-25 11:37:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's no longer different ideas, it's senseless damage and attacks. Demands that aren't near reasonable. We want peace and safety for all Americans. We all support protest and different ideas. Not Anarchy and chaos created by a crumbling democrat party.
1309334472098304000 2020-09-25 11:30:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have never been a fan of very many of the so called career politicians. A lot of them start out good, then start to stink. Schiff was a late bloomer to fame, his fake impeachment got his name out there. Potus isn't a politician, he loves America

1308916414892388354 2020-09-24 07:49:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Anyone know why Potus had to leave news conference in a hurry for an emergency phone call?
1308899711684878336 2020-09-24 06:43:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm being polite in my posts,so that I don't draw attention  to the fact that Joe Biden is corrupt and senile. Other than that he needs to be taken care of respectfully by his family. They have enough china money.
1308898249017888769 2020-09-24 06:37:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @miles_commodore That's old school feels, he could run like no other man. He was so fluid and natural at running. He was a work of art.
1308860997273255936 2020-09-24 04:09:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Facebook and Twitter have basically made it a crime to share a pic of a person shooting someone, and you commenting let's help the police find this guy. Their new censorship eliminates quotes on any person such as hunter Biden and any crime he's implicated in
1308859873824780289 2020-09-24 04:04:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Nadler seems in bad health
1308859044224999424 2020-09-24 04:01:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This in Twitter rules is a blanket censorship of anything  https://t.co/yip3n4T34n
1308856668332195846 2020-09-24 03:52:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> How long before we're gone
1308840392096452611 2020-09-24 02:47:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> All the media giants, Facebook, Twitter etc all agreed together to censor harmful content effective now. Are conservatives harmful content to them? Shouldn't they release guidelines on what they deem harmful? I don't think we will be here much longer. Do you?
1308812687472816129 2020-09-24 00:57:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The topics 6 for the debate was released yesterday. Has topics for a debate been released before? Sounds manipulated to me.Biden knows all 6 topics.  https://t.co/RYMIxWIxIe
1308807335423422465 2020-09-24 00:35:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @SoniaBa21698643 They took down over 50 of my posts. I can tweet about 8 times a day, share 8, like 4. Follow back 1 every 8 hrs. It's the 4 th time
1308806057733521410 2020-09-24 00:30:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm obviously not off suspension yet, 72 hrs is 5 pm today. I will be back after then
1308796475044962310 2020-09-23 23:52:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @PaulaSaidWhaaat I got a conservative congress woman involved. She organized 509 parents. No more body shields, masks only when walking in hallway, not in class rooms.
1308795855185510401 2020-09-23 23:50:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Their whole plan of attack on the upcoming supreme court nominee will be an assault on Christianity. Good VS Evil, even if you're not a Christian, it is the foundation this country was built on. Without Christianity socialism wins.
1308794687281680384 2020-09-23 23:45:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We're going back to covid again, riots are getting old, voter fraud is the end game. Focus on supreme court and covid. No election fraud going on here.
1308793989760536576 2020-09-23 23:42:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Should Biden, who was clearly involved as a vice president,and used his position to bring wealth to his family. Be even allowed to run for president?
1308793371562041345 2020-09-23 23:40:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Biden and his son Hunter and his brother conspired together. To use Bidens vice presidency to force companies and govt to give them wealth. We all know that, a known law breaker and traitor is running for office.
1308792535956021250 2020-09-23 23:37:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> John McCain was a traitor

1308787191838015491 2020-09-23 23:15:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Can a criminal father like Joe Biden share a cell with criminal son Hunter?  https://t.co/buMdR3uREd

1308624864484491264 2020-09-23 12:30:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Last night of suspension. God Bless America and all you amazing Patriots,  my daughter and I are going fishing.  She's been doing good,me no. Jesus Saves completely, He does it all, anyone can do it. Goodnight and God Bless. Bidens cray cray
1308601726879051776 2020-09-23 10:58:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Think Schumer, Pelosi, Schiff all sit in  a room and chant? I wonder, They seem like monsters,or they could just be liars.Imagine the anger and chaos in  their meetings. Plenty of devious thinking, same old stuff.
1308600399390269440 2020-09-23 10:53:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Any rioting going on? It's the end of the month. The rioters would be broke till they get their govt checks. Look at these people, crazies, Drug Addicts, psycho and spoiled punk kids. Dems draft choices ain't looking to good.
1308599186363944960 2020-09-23 10:48:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This should be my last night of standing in the corner for my insolence. I get it, they have the right to refuse service. Every business has a customer they would love to kick out. My son says it's the name that triggers them. Mission accomplished!
1308574950618472449 2020-09-23 09:12:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Win a free trip traveling in a car, staying in the fanciest hotels. Eating anything you want, seeing shows, all free. Riding with Biden, The prize is Biden driving you and your family in a limo across country. Would you feel safe?
1308573916793798669 2020-09-23 09:08:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's great comedy, I get all giddy waiting for the next outlandish lie. I remember yrs ago Saturday night live used to be that funny.
1308571289733476353 2020-09-23 08:58:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> 1,300 people still die every day in America from tobacco related illness. 200, 000 covid deaths  compared to 340,000 tobacco related deaths in the same time period. Since covid no tobacco deaths, cdc less than ten thou covid. Rest tobacco deaths?
1308570004301000704 2020-09-23 08:52:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My mother was 87 when she passed away. She had onset of dimentia 3 yrs prior. In all seriousness, she was more cognitive than Joe Biden. And I wouldn't have let her drive a car. Think Joe can drive a car?  Could he find the Whitehouse on his own?
1308568733187801088 2020-09-23 08:47:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Good idea, why would we give assistance to people committing crimes. You would've thought that already was a law
1308565778589941760 2020-09-23 08:36:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Everything the democrats have done and said in the last 6 mths has been ridiculous. My favorite is still when they wore the scarves and kneeled, that was hilarious. Ginsbergs last dying words, Let the next president pick the next justice lol
1308549710941216769 2020-09-23 07:32:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> How can you not laugh when you read this? If it wasn't such a serious issue, I would laugh hysterically.

1308503753075634177 2020-09-23 04:29:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I hope Biden debates Potus, he will probably fall down the basement steps he's hiding in before the election.
1308499043144867840 2020-09-23 04:10:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> What a wonderful example of the Democrat party.
1308498111573172225 2020-09-23 04:07:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> What is that?
1308490939133030403 2020-09-23 03:38:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Most people still don't realize cdc I a private non profit.associated with many special interest groups, that don't have our best interests at heart.  https://t.co/Y5pdZpbg6P
1308433336256344064 2020-09-22 23:49:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This should be my last day of suspension. Yesterday I was allowed 6 tweets, 8 RT, 8 shares and 4 likes. And 5 follow backs. Libtards are going crazy over  court appointee. Check out Don Lemon last night, he said we need to blow the whole system up.
1308247948418068480 2020-09-22 11:33:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Stopped raining, my daughter and I are going fishing. God Bless America, Thank you amazing people for fighting for America for our kids. Jesus Saved me completely over 30 yrs ago, it's easy. Goodnight, I hope I catch some, God Bless

1307715994228609025 2020-09-21 00:19:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This one needs to be shared, think about it when you read it. I believe they're  going to cut the covid scam short. For what reason? And to help whom? Is my question. How bout you?

1307124116261163010 2020-09-19 09:07:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> These dems gonna lose their minds even more. Justice Ginsberg death will cause them to go berserk. Out of respect for her service and her family, I will wait a period to allow mourning before I say anything..... Times up!

1306405040467447809 2020-09-17 09:30:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I was looking at the top 5 questions asked about China flu. We're a stupid people, or folks are having fun asking dumb questions. Does covid effect  your testicle, is it safe to bite your toe nails, should you wash your hands after using a public bathroom
1306402778449838081 2020-09-17 09:21:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @TopCat4647 Should be a wanted poster with his pic on it
1306401711465156609 2020-09-17 09:16:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We got to make sure to teach our young folks to never let this happen to them. Bill Gates is trying to dictate climate and vaccines for the world. The democrats are turning our country into a pit of anarchists.

1306396715856080896 2020-09-17 08:57:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The democrats manipulated us with saving grandma &amp; grandpa, wear the masks 2 weeks to slow the spread. Everyday we find out how much we have been lied to. Yes people died, people die every day. Everyones afraid now, this is not normal
1306390966044168194 2020-09-17 08:34:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I live where we never shut down, we don't have to wear masks, I wouldn't anyhow. I eat in restaurants and I don't wear a mask in to sit down. The movies have been open. Buffets are open. We're not dying
1306389113470357505 2020-09-17 08:26:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We all know what they're doing, we're honest law abiding citizens. We're waiting for justice, as we should. After the election I don't want to be as nice as I am now. I don't want any children or anyone living in fear of looters and rioters. Do you?

1306383341722243073 2020-09-17 08:03:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Our children have to deal with these commies in the future if we don't vote them out of positions of power. We need the house and all the rest so Potus can drain this swamp.

I'm not speaking as a conservative, I'm speaking as an American with 5 young grandchildren.BillGates is involved calling out the validity of  a vaccine. He creates people to be wary, why's he involved?
1306339795401142272 2020-09-17 05:10:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They're all involved, why even come to the briefing. Just Tell the brainwashed liberals what they want to hear.

1306330399845609473 2020-09-17 04:33:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Watch this 👇
1306329876367052813 2020-09-17 04:31:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> 👇👇Watch this Tucker  it's important. If it works they will overthrow our elected president. We won't know, msm won't show it. Hillary is pushing all the social media platforms to censor more, Twitter will disconnect us.
1306316253594898434 2020-09-17 03:37:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If you haven't watched the Tucker show with the guy explaining the dems are using the same plan to overthrow Potus,as we use to overthrow other countrys Govts. If it occurs after the election we will be disconnected.
1306315222156795904 2020-09-17 03:33:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Now they're going to question Comey,Clapper and Brennan. Why didn't Durham get them? Are they all covering each other's burrs. Sure seems that way doesn't it. Potus is the only one really working for us. The rest are trying to move up the ladder.

1306297529877790727 2020-09-17 02:22:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The democrats are creating, funding, organizing these riots in a attempt to steal our election. Why aren't the Republicans doing something to counter other than grandstanding. That's all they're doing is talking. Why aren't we arresting people

1306286374702718976 2020-09-17 01:38:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Stop listening to your govenors if they are restricting your freedom. They cannot override the constitution. Their emergency powers acts are unconstitutional. Open up your businesses, go out, stop hiding.
1306285715966361600 2020-09-17 01:35:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I know this to be a fact, and those who have heard of it believe it's a myth. Many Democrats are in the circles of people who teach this.  https://t.co/b2Pnabi5Pj

1306279529795776513 2020-09-17 01:11:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If you believe in demonic actions, our Democrat party is proof Satan is in their midst.

1306248763028185088 2020-09-16 23:09:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Not gonna happen, Biden is not gonna debate Potus. We know that, if he did it should be a pay per view event. The money goes to covid business relief  https://t.co/zYN8w51KWd

I was raised a simple country guy, after college I realized I had a natural ability to re structure companies and increase their profits. I always ask questions about things I don't know, that's how I learn.

1306079947539255297 2020-09-16 11:58:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Bidens staff posted that they're advising Biden not to debate Trump because he goes out of control and fact checking will slow the process down. He's posted similar posts all day. They're fixing to cancel debate. This guy had Biden Harris in June on his page.
1306077865201618945 2020-09-16 11:50:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I just saw a Democrat influencer post Biden is missing, like he's not were he's supposed to be. Probably locked in a bathroom
1306076453738512384 2020-09-16 11:44:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My diversity question came from a county report telling all these percentages of people in your county. One was pacific islander at 1 &amp; 1/4. That made me think of my neighborhood which is rural. Cities seem to be divided by income levels.
1306075160722788352 2020-09-16 11:39:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @EllieLovesUSA I asked the question because the census posted a county breakdown by race. I started thinking in my neighborhood. I was interested in the fact we had 1  1/4 pacific islanders. Did one f them get cut up. lol
1306072749341802496 2020-09-16 11:29:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @RegularRefiller @MustangMan_TX I'm thinking the 2nd

1306062894136725511 2020-09-16 10:50:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @AlbertS42767723 I hate all the labeling, in the city near me there are parts of town segregated by income more than skin color. I grew up in NW PA never met a black man till I got drafted.
1306061909905543170 2020-09-16 10:46:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @PAPPYL0VELL I have 36 acres

1306053373070901250 2020-09-16 10:12:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> they're 16 homes in my neighborhood. 5 are blackfolks,2 Mexican Americans, the rest European I assume. Most have lived in this area and built their home up to 35 yrs ago. Few sold and moved, I was the only house 37 yrs ago. Is your neighborhoods diverse.
1306050786162626560 2020-09-16 10:02:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Liz88233601 Me as well, I stayed there 21 days free, we held the MLB winter meetings there. Went back many times to stay a night or two. Very pricey but worth it.

1306036569183342592 2020-09-16 09:05:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Remember when all our heroes weren't rapist and criminals. And our sports stars loved the game, instead of attacking the country that made their ungrateful butt rich. All Hollywood wasn't pedos, and most news were fair. President was respected
1306034082728611840 2020-09-16 08:56:04 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Isn't it odd to you that bill gates is undermining the Fda saying it can no longer be trusted. I don't know about you, the Fda just moved up in my list.
1306033094173040640 2020-09-16 08:52:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have to say when I read Bill Gates had died, I wasn't sad. Then I saw it said SR. Probably a conservative.
1306032493527785472 2020-09-16 08:49:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Bloomberg is a dangerous piece of dung. Most people hate him, they don't know how much media he controls.  https://t.co/1H3m40o9fI

1306030928398082049 2020-09-16 08:43:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The middle east peace deals being signed are historic. No mention on msm, if Obama could've done that they would've sacrificed a commoner to kick off the award ceremonies. Every pervert in Hollywood would've showed up in their limos

We allowed this to happen, globalist are thinking we can end disease and climate change if we control the people. We know these people are looney, Gates and many dems and other nutbags.

They're are many that still have a chance to be saved. Others are taking their last breaths. We must get loud on this now!
1306013800621981696 2020-09-16 07:35:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @SheliaRaineyKno A beautiful pic, what a wonderful memory.
1306013586356080642 2020-09-16 07:34:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> You can't destroy our country under the falsehood everyones grandma and grandpa is gonna die. I'm a grandpa with an immune disease, I'm mad you're not out working and doing things. You and your families need interaction. End the masks, do it.
1306012667514159110 2020-09-16 07:30:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We have to get all businesses open everywhere. The dems are intentionally destroying our jobs. The numbers of unemployed are going to be overwhelming. Any small business owner would know the magnitude this has on them and our restaurants
1306004235822211078 2020-09-16 06:57:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @mountainlady15 @USATODAY Surely you're not implying msm would be lying to American citizens

1305952214696034321 2020-09-16 03:30:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> That they did  Open up Americans, we don't need their approval. Open your businesses up, let adults decide for themselves. The people trying to guilt you into the mask are violating your rights. They have a right to wear it, and you not to. Goes both ways
1305948401654259712 2020-09-16 03:15:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @NowMaga I have learned after the tech bubble to never trust the market. It's strong because they feel secure in a Trump victory. Remember they're investing in invented futures
1305937157144670213 2020-09-16 02:30:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have got a pasture to mow, thanks for reading my ramblings. It's okay if you disagree, we're Americans, it's okay to disagree.

1305934068312350723 2020-09-16 02:18:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @gkirila Commie lol
1305925159774285825 2020-09-16 01:43:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The democrats are creating hysteria for a bigger shut down coming soon. It will be the nail in the coffin for our service industry. We can't let it happen again.
1305924490891845638 2020-09-16 01:40:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> As fast as our companies go under, China is buying them up. Democrats love suckling the China  teet. More money in their pockets and their supporters. LeBron James is supporting China against Trump, not BLM. Don't be fooled by these corporations.
1305923467938799622 2020-09-16 01:36:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Truth👇👇
1305923199214006280 2020-09-16 01:35:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Everyday we stand idly by as democrats commit the greatest Hoax, covid 19. They have shut down small businesses, they've closed your indoor restaurants all big employers. At least half are gone before years end, to late. Amazon&amp; walmart&amp; tech growing.
1305921948820615169 2020-09-16 01:30:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @GGalvas @PlaneAndSimple2 I agree
1305921897876656131 2020-09-16 01:30:17 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The issue of race, climate, free this n that, entitlements, it's all as we would say, throw shit against the wall hoping some will stick. That is the democrats platform, they have nothing  to surpass Trumps agenda. Just destruction to gain power
1305920401420288000 2020-09-16 01:24:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Don't forget before covid 1,300 Americans died everyday, 480,000 a year in the USA from Tobacco related illness. Since covid have you heard that number? How bout over 600,000 die every year of heart disease. Don't hear that anymore
1305918837896945665 2020-09-16 01:18:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @DMolbeck @PrayingActress Lol, forgot all about that classic
1305917826474168320 2020-09-16 01:14:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I support and follow this guy here, he's a black conservative. He's talking on the way I view life, so I can relate to his posts. He's conservative but fed up with the leftist b.s. Just like me.
1305916616543277063 2020-09-16 01:09:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I was born with natural abilities that specialized in making big corporations profitable. I mention I worked here or there, I have been the CEO of big corps. And owned many businesses. This shut down is gonna destroy our jobs, we can't continue.
1305914481336254470 2020-09-16 01:00:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Support the black conservatives running for office. At least follow them and share. Follow everyday black conservatives on here, we can help them reach more imprisoned blacks away from the democrats. We all want opportunity and safety.
1305911806259605511 2020-09-16 00:50:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My point on black Americans, They're discovering the crimes of the democrats. It's everyday normal black citizens saying, wait, Trump is doing this and that. They're seeing results effecting their lives, Spread the word. Support our black conservatives.
1305909993863028739 2020-09-16 00:42:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @austduchess1 91 % of black voters voted Hillary
1305909643131187200 2020-09-16 00:41:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @austduchess1 My point was with Obama, take out black vote completely. Obama still wins
1305908990631645186 2020-09-16 00:39:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The big voting block to the dems is not the black vote. It's the unions that vote Democrat, the poor trapped in a system. Take skin color out of the equation, they all fit in these other boxes. Govt jobs, welfare, housing, drugs, poor schools
1305906973632868352 2020-09-16 00:30:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @austduchess1 90% for Hillary as well
1305906818741346304 2020-09-16 00:30:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @austduchess1 The black vote was irrelevant in Obama  and Trump. In both elections if all black voters voted against the winner. Both Obama and Trump would've won
1305906245329711105 2020-09-16 00:28:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The black vote had no impact on  Obama or Trumps win. The fact that a group of people are expected to vote  Democrat because of their skin color is insulting. Biden said you ain't black if you're not voting for him. What black person would agree with that?
1305901492348555267 2020-09-16 00:09:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I promise you most Democrat black Americans have no idea they're a small minority of our population. They also believe their vote will determine the election outcome. Why? Democrats have forced black people to depend on hand outs
1305899658737324032 2020-09-16 00:01:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrats have made honoring our police and military a bad punishable offense. Showing support for the president of United States is not allowed in many businesses. Worshiping a rapist who is a criminal, but since he's black it's our fault. Democrats did this
1305897308035440641 2020-09-15 23:52:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I fear next year we will be looking back thinking why didnt we step up and do something. All these jobs are soon to be gone. It won't be long if we don't act now, job loss is going to be to big to recover. Open up Save America now!
1305896267088830464 2020-09-15 23:48:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Indoor dining restaurants are a great job for millions of Americans. They're in trouble, my son manages a cheesecake factory. Before covid cash surplus, covid starts and Forbes says if anyone survives cheesecake would be first. Soon closing
1305895066800713729 2020-09-15 23:43:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> This shutdown has to end now, if not we are going to lose to many jobs. Many companies will be closed soon, we're on the verge of millions of jobs lost forever. We could lose over 40% of our service industry jobs by December.
1305894073451057152 2020-09-15 23:39:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> the smug elitists democrats  and their billionaire tech buddies already are controlling our lives. We have to watch what we say on here, you're gone if it doesn't fit their agenda.  A small group of Anti American people control all our communicating.
1305886333508911104 2020-09-15 23:08:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Here is the problem, democrats are releasing the arson the same day they're arrested. The arson are Democrat supported obviously, in a red state they wouldn't be back out starting fires again  https://t.co/iZkF5EX1sC
1305884938777038849 2020-09-15 23:03:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @carl_alston1557 I heard that at university of Texas in 74
1305882433523462144 2020-09-15 22:53:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> What does it matter what the Bill gates &amp; Bill Nye the science guy say. They're not elected, appointed or qualified for anything
1305874501863964677 2020-09-15 22:21:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> 100%
1305874398214262790 2020-09-15 22:21:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Not our suburbs, only Democrat controlled states seem to suffer these flood &amp; fires from fake climate change. They need a party change, conservatives will fix it for the voters.
1305724245301919749 2020-09-15 12:24:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The Democras are the party of Billionaires and  China collaborating corporate CEOs who hate Trumps China policy.
1305723343820263424 2020-09-15 12:21:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Agreed
1305721438800941058 2020-09-15 12:13:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @SheliaRaineyKno I have 3 daughters and a son. One of my daughters lives beside me, she lost her husband in a work accident a couple years ago. We hang out together 7 days a week.
1305719476055310338 2020-09-15 12:05:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It been along day and I'm grateful for all of your thoughts and prayers. God Bless America and all you patriotic folks. My daughter and I continue our fishing quest for that big nite  coming. Jesus Saves completely, Goodnight &amp; God Bless you all.
1305716897783123969 2020-09-15 11:55:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Bls1022 @deplorableRobT I was born there, the people have changed, they've accepted defeat. There is so little opportunity or hope in PA for a future. Wolf is a dumb person, I met him once, just dumb.
1305715144375316480 2020-09-15 11:48:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It is true tho, Mr Biden is sadly suffering From dimentia. Disturbing you support the abuse to Mr Biden.
1305713465391185920 2020-09-15 11:42:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Maricristy I am, Thank you for the kind words.
1305712706280980480 2020-09-15 11:39:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I don't mean to rant about stuff we've all talked about. The problem is people are okay without talking about it anymore. Masks, shutting our country down, the violence diverted us away. Are people getting used to the new normal? We can't fall down that hole.
1305710727811002371 2020-09-15 11:31:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @frozenorthfarm These democrats would sacrifices anything for power, so sad.
1305709174383407105 2020-09-15 11:25:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Everyone knows covids real and people died. A small percentage of people died, the compromised with mostly comorbidities. I'm in that group of high risk. I don't want you or anyone else to lose there livelihood because the flu is here.
1305707091198242816 2020-09-15 11:16:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @SandiMay18 @Magirly9 Almost the drs exact words

1305701635243626500 2020-09-15 10:55:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @tomfinnell I agree with you but the flu every year does the same indiscriminate death dance. We don't go into rants or hysteria, because msm media manipulated the covid it's changed everyone's safety zone. And it shouldn't
1305686269012447232 2020-09-15 09:53:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @tomfinnell I disagree completely, total deaths are  down in our country. Prior to covid 1,300 people died of tobacco related deaths daily alone. fat or skinny is irrelevant. People are dying of normal diseases that kill them.
1305684879703670786 2020-09-15 09:48:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @topgolf46 Yep
1305684493991317504 2020-09-15 09:46:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Anyone attacks you in your vehicle you run them over. Defend your family and yourself
1305682437851185153 2020-09-15 09:38:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Globalist are defeating our country thru controlling us. Test 1 got us to hide and wear masks for a flu. Don't forget almost 50% of deaths in NY &amp; PA nursing homes. Cdc said less Than 10,000 died from covid. The rest died from what was going to kill them
1305681398825660416 2020-09-15 09:34:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> From now on every flu season they're wanting us to wear masks. Fauci changed it until we get a global universal vaccine. We don't need it, our bodies know what to do. If you don't  make a stand, kids will always grow up wearing masks . its a flu
1305680505640230920 2020-09-15 09:31:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> No matter if everyone in a store is wearing a mask, go in without one. Most or a good amount will take theirs off.  You can stay a safe distance from people if it makes you feel better. How many years are you gonna be afraid?
1305679155976187904 2020-09-15 09:25:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We have to stop giving up our freedoms, If you don't think this was all orchestrated, I got swamp land to sell you. They never have the authority to violate the constitution. It would be unconstitutional to do that, they're gonna keep pushing.
1305677935584702469 2020-09-15 09:20:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm never wearing a mask,  they know it doesn't work. The states that had the toughest restrictions on masks had a higher death rate. You're gonna touch your face, it's the flu, you're making your chance of catching higher wearing a mask
1305677022178562049 2020-09-15 09:17:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Pervert for president, hide your children, it's true he has dimentia and is in appropriate with children.
1305673233497194496 2020-09-15 09:02:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I didn't wear a mask at the hospital. The drs in the room with me didn't either.All the receptionist people had no masks on. Nurses and drs walking the halls all had there masks below their noses.
1305672213073461248 2020-09-15 08:58:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Wheeler and dem govenors allowing these terrorists in their streets should all be tarred and feathered.

1305325448247865344 2020-09-14 10:00:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Earlier today when I mentioned Potus needing money. My intention were to strictly remind those who have extra money, not lay an obligation on anyone. I'm feeling rich so I have an extra 50, I only give when I can afford it.

1305282960636235777 2020-09-14 07:11:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> For those of you who don't know, I had stage 3 kidney cancer. I quit all sugar and processed flour. 6 weeks ago I went in for pre surgery scan. My 2 tumors at 2 cm each, 1 gone, the other down to half a cm. I know I'm cancer free, tomorrow confirms it
1305277919154130944 2020-09-14 06:51:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Not much to say today, the day before you go back to the hospital to get your cancer results is stressful. I'm not afraid, I'm optimistic, I know my kids are  concerned. I don't want them worried, I just want it to be over with so I can mow my pasture.

1305183456280838144 2020-09-14 00:35:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Potus doesn't need money when he can hold his big rallys, but he can't. The dems made sure of that. I'm not asking you to donate money. I stated a fact, you don't have to agree, it's still the truth.

Florida is in play, as are many states. Texas is as close as I like to say, we have 3 of the ten biggest cities in America run by dems and shut down still.

1304860645247135746 2020-09-13 03:13:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have mentored youth thru small business for over 20 yrs. I teach them how to make a business plan, set goals and how to obtain them. I also teach it takes hard work and dedication. I teach honesty and acceptance of all as core values. I pray with them
1304859023364296705 2020-09-13 03:06:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @TenorTerrific I live on a lake and a stream runs thru my farm into the lake. This time of yr the big fish come to that stream to feed at night. Mostly channel cats and schools of crappie. As soon as the weather changes the sand bass will spawn up that stream.
1304857784383680512 2020-09-13 03:01:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Govt officials and school teachers involved in rioting and destruction. This is a time for all people of all races and beliefs to join together for freedom. The very existence of our way of life is on the line.
1304856547584094208 2020-09-13 02:56:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The dems count on the fact that we're not animals, just law abiding citizens. The incidents are happening in areas full of liberal minded adults. A mayor on t. V. Calling police pigs in Minnesota. They're ramping up any division between people for any reason
1304855185139920903 2020-09-13 02:51:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I almost expect another 9/11 type disaster orchestrated by the radical left. They're willing to do anything to overthrow our election.
1304853674951348230 2020-09-13 02:45:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They're ramping up the covid scare again, it's everywhere on msm. They are pushing a total shutdown till end of 2021.Some backoff and say till next summer, but they don't mean it. Many say shut down can't open till All are Vaccinated. Mandatory is implied
1304851645935878145 2020-09-13 02:37:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I listen to a lot of young liberal streamers while fishing at night. Curiosity drove me to try to understand their thinking. They always end up promoting violence and a lot are anti semitic, which is confusing. They have large followings listening to them.

1304844988522459137 2020-09-13 02:11:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My neighbor is a older black man, he's a conservative. He told me the Democrat party is in their churches indoctrinating their youth.The democrats fund many church events in his community. Are their any black conservatives that experience that on here?
1304840192054960129 2020-09-13 01:51:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Our youth are in trouble, the world teaches them that values and empathy aren't reality. Parents today are losing their kids to the information highway, and none of it's good.All of their questions are answered by Google or a streamer. They're confused
1304838627671838725 2020-09-13 01:45:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have a lot of young people 16 to 21 that come hang out and talk to me. They're very confused in this world, they have so much information they can't process it all. They're at an age where they should be dreaming of a future. Not worrying about life
1304837484556234753 2020-09-13 01:41:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @leathelioness2 It's true
1304835354483191809 2020-09-13 01:32:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I don't like to get angry at other people, you don't know what battles they're fighting in their lives.When I ran a store next to a university I realized so many horrific things. Most girls have experienced some type of sexual assault. It breaks my heart
1304830568987754496 2020-09-13 01:13:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We live in a time were anyone displaying a flag or anything patriotic, We know they're conservatives. Didn't used to be that way.

1304817889195765761 2020-09-13 00:23:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Sorry about soap box earlier.Went to a neighborhood assoc. Meeting, a developer from CA is trying to buy land next to us to relocate Californians. My suggestion is let's get a lawyer and fight him. Many others are thinking after election dems will change.

1304808995358732294 2020-09-12 23:48:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We can't  assume  level heads in the Democrat party,or their voters will prevail. Their isn't any, anyone who hasn't drank the kool-aid is already gone. After rioting, the congress of our country kneeling about the deaths of criminals and attacking  police.
1304807409681084417 2020-09-12 23:41:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Trumps middle east deal is the biggest news in the world. Know one really knows or cares here. They have successfully indoctrinated our youth and older people caught up in msm. I guarantee you, the majority hate us as evil despicable scum bags
1304806451265916930 2020-09-12 23:37:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If a Democrat politician says something, even if absurd, you don't dare question them. If you do you're a white supremacist  Trump loving piece of crap.  Sadly their voters are fallen inline  with these ideas. Not all, but the majority have.
1304805166928015361 2020-09-12 23:32:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> New pools show NEARLY 2 Of 3 people think Ted Wheeler,Portland Mayor is acting incorrectly. It would a big unanimous for me, Dems like him and Pelosi, Deblasio,  inslee, they don't care what voters think. They're in chg, they know whats best not you.
1304803501944590337 2020-09-12 23:26:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The mayors and govenors in these protest cities are Anarchists. They are still encouraging these domestic terrorists to appease Democrat party leaders. They are above our Govts law, The people who live there must be Anarchists to?

1304794941936238594 2020-09-12 22:52:10 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm old enough to remember that managing forests by cutting them out created new growth. Allowing us to create an industry from a  product that grows back. Eliminates forest fires by clearing out dead trees and undergrowth. Today that's a NO, save the tree.
1304793576371519491 2020-09-12 22:46:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The lies told by the democrats are so  absurd and completely false. I promise you even in our conservative group, the indoctrination of climate change has many believers. Even tho their is no fact to prove it. Say it enough, people believe it.
1304788048496996352 2020-09-12 22:24:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @the2afamily If we don't win all executive branches?

1304626402009010177 2020-09-12 11:42:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The LeBron James part to me is disturbing. I got my 16 yr old grandson into watching him and telling him what an example he was to kids. How he came from nothing, worked hard and made it to the NBA. Played in his hometown team, now he knows,he's no good.
1304624645556011008 2020-09-12 11:35:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Did you folks see Pelosi rambling on like a maniacal  witch about mother earth being angry. Lol, reminded me of when the morons wore them scarves and kneeled, cept Nadler. They're like a comedy horror show, these people are crazy. Lol

The unity and love the whole country had was amazing. I'm going out with my daughter to eat Alligator, and be thankful for America and Potus.
1304595419851296768 2020-09-12 09:39:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Do you wonder like I do, what are the democrats going to do next. They've lied against our president, held fake impeachment. Support rioting and many dems participated attacking police. They're capable of any godless act.
1304592950316462080 2020-09-12 09:29:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm sick and tired of the democrats dividing Americans into little groups for their political gain. They control the media portraying us as right wing white supremacist. They manipulate black Americans with a sense of entitlements. Democrats destroy lives.
1304590196244180994 2020-09-12 09:18:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I never thought our country would get to a place were things that are moral and decent are wrong. We celebrate perversion and abuse of people and power. A singer or sports star is more honored than our president.God Bless America land that I love!
1304588338301734912 2020-09-12 09:11:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> President Trump has done more for America than any president in my life. He loves this country and all of its people. He's fighting for all of us, to bring our jobs back. To create a safe peaceful country for all to live in. Democrats hate it!
1304587014558429184 2020-09-12 09:05:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The coming together of all Americans lasted for many years after 9/11.Obama actually with Biden &amp; Hillary &amp; Traitor John Kerry turned it all off. They kicked into overdrive dividing America by skin color, belief and any other issue.

1304260665952145409 2020-09-11 11:29:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> To be honest I just  heard this stuff in the last  month. I thought we were one people, I'm not the kinda guy to judge folks because we're a different color. The democrats promote this to create division, many black Americans aware
1304237773180858370 2020-09-11 09:58:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> No disrespect meant, what is the black national anthem? When did we get it? Do you know it? Is the real one now considered white, brown, red anthem, or are we including in the black national anthem? Just wondering, I thought it stood for all.
1304233094560575489 2020-09-11 09:39:35 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I enjoy interacting with a group of like minded folks.We might be deplorable to them, But we love this country and what it stands for.I like standing for my country, I like singing the anthem at sports, it's part of the event.
1304231165436588033 2020-09-11 09:31:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The past few days have kept me busy, I miss being on more, but I'm caught up. Tractor fixed, puppies in shelter, hot water heater replaced, roof leak fixed. Fishing later tonight, lite drizzle 88 deg, no wind, big minnows. Hope the NFL numbers are low tonight

1304129350300729344 2020-09-11 02:47:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They have blocked me from following, I have only followed 15 since 6 am. So I will follow back asap. Someone is noticing the NFL boycott hash tag and they don't want it.

I have been shut down for hours, just got back on the last few minutes. If individuals hash tag boycott NFL it works. If I RT a bunch of the hash tag they shut me down
1304124605553090561 2020-09-11 02:28:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I believe in RT people who respond to my Posts. If a post gets a lot of RTS they have been shutting me down. The other day when I tweeted that I'm beating kidney cancer, it was RT a bunch. They shut me off the whole day.
1304123588568649730 2020-09-11 02:24:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I guess they took down 1 or more of my tweets or RT. In my opinion there was nothing false or threatening on anything I posted.  I believe the boycott the NFL was trending and I was involved. Or other posts I made on the vaccine or Schiff.

That's  a little over 200,000 folks who die every 5 mths from tobacco related death. Same 5 mths covid been here

He had emphysema for years and in his mid 90s, his wife fought the covid death on him. They said cdc orders and they would straighten it out later

1303542228493762560 2020-09-09 11:54:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @luuu_ted @topgolf46 We all have to protect our families. It's a reasonable thing to do, stay safe brother.
1303541482578677761 2020-09-09 11:51:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @NancySpinelli9 I ate at a sushi buffet this evening. It's a fancy one, they keep sending coupons so I keep coming. My daughter and I laughed, they're probably scamming us with the coupon.
1303540763045892098 2020-09-09 11:48:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @grl_lopez Can't say on here, said something in July that put my one daughter in danger.
1303540046197403650 2020-09-09 11:45:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @StellarRevolts Whole County 35 deaths, our death rate for illnesses is half compared to last year. Covid cured everything here.
1303539530390220801 2020-09-09 11:43:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @luuu_ted @topgolf46 I got threats back in July on my one daughter, I slipped up and said the wrong thing. These people are crazy, almost had to send a couple to Jesus.
1303538815857033218 2020-09-09 11:40:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Young democrats grow up to be Pelosi, Schiff, Bidens, not a good thing. It's like a 3 headed cat, useless and a pain in the butt. I don't want to ever hear that this Democrat isn't like that,he's conservative. To risky in todays world.
1303537142178684928 2020-09-09 11:34:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My area never shut down, in Texas the governor orders masks. The counties and cities decide whether to enforce it or not. Mine did not, we have no democrats in authority in my County. We vote straight red, it's the only way to stay safe.
1303534594487201793 2020-09-09 11:24:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @luuu_ted @topgolf46 I shared the post, I got 5 grandkids to protect there. Can't give much more, learned that the hard way.
1303533968709558272 2020-09-09 11:21:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Great job governor, We love you and support you. Open the whole state up, Texas is red all over. Make these democrat mayors do it the right way, or hold up their money.
1303512500256886784 2020-09-09 09:56:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Sir, I'm glad we have you on Americas Team. Keep on fighting, it's very encouraging to hear you speak. Thank you, God Bless.
1303511704047939584 2020-09-09 09:53:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We all know we have what seems like an eternity till the election. Many crazy things are probably coming our way, I'm ready.  It doesn't hurt to celebrate every now and then does it? We know our jobs, we just got to do it Trump 2020

1303509834193612801 2020-09-09 09:45:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My post tonight was not meant to downplay the crimes the Democrat party has committed against America. Covid, rioting, attempts to destroy our economy. Spying on Potus, hiding in a basement for a fake impeachment. So many crimes against America
1303508488296058880 2020-09-09 09:40:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @doberman_wi_USA @DoriMuetz I posted part of the post, I scratched out the town. I have 5 grandchildren there.  https://t.co/FKbw4V4Rih
1303507920357937152 2020-09-09 09:38:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I so badly want to watch Pelosi slither out of that speaker of the house position. Schiff a traitor, be kicked off the intelligence committee.
1303504945300353024 2020-09-09 09:26:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> After the election I expect to see these criminals in our govt in jail. Just like you I'm tired of govt officials breaking our laws and escaping punishment. We need something in place to never allow these govenors to take our people's freedoms away again.
1303503678079410176 2020-09-09 09:21:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Biden choosing Harris was a gift to conservatives. She has alienated so many people, she's like a scarecrow to voters.  Potus is always a few steps ahead of them. We still have to do our part, I'm still working getting people who quit voting back  https://t.co/1IiX0BoPro

1303488877110460420 2020-09-09 08:22:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm so excited to see the poll numbers, I believe the vote will be so overwhelming that mail in ballots will be irrelevant. I'm taking 23 people to vote and my daughter here is taking 17. Liberal tears and conservative joy make a good drink.
1303487498988007425 2020-09-09 08:16:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter in PA, her town has a community Facebook page. A Democrat working her County for Biden made a post on the community page. He said it's obvious this  is  an area of uneducated  people due to all the Trump signs. Not worthy of victory lol
1303480640747298817 2020-09-09 07:49:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I just watched msm to see what they had to say about Potus speech. Saying Biden still leading but Trump drew closer in a few states.  If they're saying that, Potus surely is way ahead. What do you think?
1303450677339922432 2020-09-09 05:50:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Haven't been on much today, it's been raining and I have found my   garage is leaking. I'm trying to get tarps up on the roof in the rain. Back later

I live in a farm community that has become infested with city folks, building houses on top of houses.These roads are narrow back roads, joggers everywhere, women joggers pushing babies. Like cockroaches lol

I know for a fact that the democrats have  tryed to manipulate every minority to believe it. Rich White people telling other white people they're bad people

Jesus Saves completely, it's easy to do, He did it all. God Bless, Thank you all so much for encouragement, sorry to be negative. Tired of the hatred.
1303161893457211392 2020-09-08 10:43:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter and I are going fishing early tonight hoping to change our luck.
1303160231032221697 2020-09-08 10:36:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Forgive my ramblings, like you folks I worry about my kids and grandkids. The dems are so unhinged I expect anything from them. I have never seen such demonic actions. They're destroying small businesses, and their own cities and states
1303158403062288384 2020-09-08 10:29:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm sure all of us are thinking what's next? Is covid gonna end after the election? What's gonna happen with mail in voting? How long before we get final vote results? I'm voting in person, some can't, those that can will go out and vote.
1303156800699674630 2020-09-08 10:22:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Detailman5 They're videos on some of these streams, obvious acting, yet it's still out there.  These people spread their propaganda on streams. They're not on Twitter, still spreading false info. Sadly
1303155549505232896 2020-09-08 10:17:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The dems know Trump is a big landslide. I wish they would  stop going nuts about it  and do their jobs to help America. I know they're not going to do the right thing. Their party is falling into chaos and fracturing. That's the real war, my opinion
1303153949898346497 2020-09-08 10:11:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Everytime I watch BLM lately, I see nothing but white kids being morons. The streamer said the rural areas dominated by the uneducated,you see Trump signs. In the cities and around colleges you see Biden signs, these are your educated people.

I'm waiting to see if they will run the asteroid story for a day or two. Imagine flu, covid season, they're salivating over that.mail in ballots?
1303150672024662020 2020-09-08 09:58:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I was just watching a stream out of Portland with over 120,000 people listening. Interviewing rioters claiming to be in danger from Trump supporters. That Trump supporters are burning to make them look bad, rich white kids saying this.

It's funny in a twisted way, I don't think that the majority of dems even believe it.They could claim Biden was Jesus with a straight face, till they create a new story. Doesn't need any truth.
1303146270425600000 2020-09-08 09:40:56 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The democrats are trying to provoke a racial war. They're creating scenarios, for  a narrative that white people are hunting black people. LeBron James said that very thing, white people get guns to hunt black people. It's untrue as we know

1303015226812628995 2020-09-08 01:00:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I remember a while back the democrats were pushing for our capital to be occupied Sept 15 th till the election. I wonder if that's still a thing? I wish we could go occupy the capital, we have responsibilities. I hope it doesn't happen.
1303013443923042304 2020-09-08 00:53:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm fortunate to live in a part of Texas that's so red and full of Patriots who love God and country.

1303002134062002179 2020-09-08 00:08:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The crimes the democrats have committed against our children going to school,are abusive and unforgivable.  My grandkids in PA are wearing a mask and carrying a body shield to walk thru the school.  https://t.co/pp6W6iVNNN
1302998165059178496 2020-09-07 23:52:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> For days the democrats and Hollywood commies have been tweeting for people to follow Biden. Let's get him to 10 million before labor day. Just checked they failed 9.2 MIL. How much excitement for a candidate, when begging didn't work.
1302995936155758597 2020-09-07 23:43:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> the democrats that are filled with hatred toward us and our country.  Have know idea what wonderful caring people conservatives are. They have lost their love for their fellow Americans. They lack empathy, and are driven by hate fueled by the media.
1302993736847286273 2020-09-07 23:34:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When you see a person  blew up a house chasing a fly, you have to read that lol. A 90 yr old man was chasing a fly with a new electric fly swatter. He struck the fly near a gas leak.🤔🤔  https://t.co/Biz38JX1wd
1302991476675301376 2020-09-07 23:25:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm at my daughters boutique on the lake, I'm going to stay all day. To many out of state people on the road passing her store. Yesterday's traffic pass her shop was over 400,000 cars, normal is 75,000. Hoping to meet some nice folks today

1302968199311433729 2020-09-07 21:53:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter and I went fishing last night for the 12 th night in a row. We were out till 3:30 with minnows, we only caught 2. It was one of those nights that the fish pickup the bait, run with it and spit it out before you can set the hook. We just fed them.
1302965868071137281 2020-09-07 21:44:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm overwhelmed by the amount of people who responded to my kidney cancer announcement. I have been waiting to go back to the Dr. I couldn't keep quiet about it any longer. God Bless all of you for prayers and thoughts for me. Thank you from my heart to yours
1302819904534515712 2020-09-07 12:04:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter and I are going fishing again. That big night is soon, gotta keep going.God Bless America &amp; all you amazing Patriots. Goodnight, Jesus Saves, it's a gift of God, it's simple. Thank you for all kind gestures on my kidney cancer🙏

1302759980341309440 2020-09-07 08:05:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm positive I have beaten kidney cancer. I go back the 14th for them to try and figure out how 2 tumors both bigger than 2 cm. 1 gone, the other down to 1/2 a cm. I ate zero sugar, cut process flour out, exercised, vitamins and Prayer.
1302758633177075712 2020-09-07 08:00:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @OmaLinda50 @GovAbbott @WatchChad I agree, always supported Abbott, and still do. But I could change my mind, Hoping he will get on the right path asap
1302757473535881216 2020-09-07 07:56:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> A friend of mine was the first covid death in our county. I'm mad they called it Covid. It was in the early pretest days, he was 92 in intensive care with emphysema before covid.He was dying, they called it a covid death. Disgraceful medical practice
1302747753341165571 2020-09-07 07:17:22 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> A cold front has hit us, todays high only 91. Tomorrow high 83 and low of 78. 3 days coming in a row of a cold front. The Crappie will be biting in shallow water at night.I got minnows at the house and tonight is it. Last night No bites🙈

1302709335525593088 2020-09-07 04:44:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's rare to meet a Texan who doesn't carry at all times. I personally don't know anyone who is not armed. Don't need it, but that's probably why
1302705348571213824 2020-09-07 04:28:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @5JMW9 I watch a lot of these groups leaders streaming. They're getting mad that dems are hijacking their agenda. At first they helped, I think they've lost control and are trying to say it's against Trump in support of Biden. To manipulate, my opinion
1302704424381489152 2020-09-07 04:25:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> There is no race war, we know that. In my area just as many black  Patriots would stomp these punks as well. It's a globalist attack that's organization is falling a part, to cover those who funded it. We now have regular criminals working the streets
1302703082657247233 2020-09-07 04:19:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The dems are hoping to gain control but can't. In the end we will have to rescue them as well. After the election I'm sure Potus will stomp it out. It would take no time for our federal officers if unhindered to clean these rag tags up.
1302702210204213249 2020-09-07 04:16:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> When this crap started the dems claimed it as unrest for their cause. Then their own looney faction like Wheeler &amp; Deblasio tryed to be cool and join in. The rioters are enabled by dems. The dems are over their heads, they don't control this group.
1302701356885716993 2020-09-07 04:13:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> 2 days after Potus was elected Hillary was calling for rioting in the streets. She has no followers, she's irrelevant. She's trying to lay claim to what's happening for her own grandisement. The people on the streets would eat her up if she came near her.
1302700001907429376 2020-09-07 04:07:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The Democrat politicians are the ones doing the threatening towards us. No matter what Trump will not be in the White house, is it just rhetoric, or a warning. Rioters are okay, if we defend ourselves we're white supremacist.
1302666713322991616 2020-09-07 01:55:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I no longer deliver meals everyday, I miss my people. After 6 mths I found out my volunteering was keeping someone with disabilities from getting paid to do it. I'm the fill in guy now, if they're short handed.
1302664154348748800 2020-09-07 01:45:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I got a 90 yr old man who is on my meal delivery route his first smartphone. He was interested in keeping up with events. He just called me and he's out of data, told me he plays a golf game 10 hrs a day and he's on a team called Trump 2020 lol
1302659883595108355 2020-09-07 01:28:13 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The evil and hatred in the eyes and speech of Clinton&amp; Pelosi are demonic. CNN Cuomo, Trapper,Stelter, They're more like sick demented power hungry elitist who demand your respect and worship. Most of the rest are just habitual liars or TDS infected.
1302654912946491398 2020-09-07 01:08:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Lying media, we know better
1302652892881604609 2020-09-07 01:00:26 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter and I just went to a coffee shop and saw a lady with a paper mask and a cloth mask on top of it. Jokingly I said I see you're going for double strength. She looked all wild eyed and said I can't wait to get out of Texas and go home. Home is Co.
1302646396684824576 2020-09-07 00:34:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We can't trust most of our govt, medical, science, education,charaties media or our neighbors. The Democrat controlled media runs the minds of the weak and mentally ill.
1302645427867713536 2020-09-07 00:30:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> As long as the media is the enemy of the people we will never be one again.
1302644638403231750 2020-09-07 00:27:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Remember California when they had a republican governor. Back then most of the celebrities were patriotic and supported our police and military. Remember how we were all 1 with New York city after 9/11. I raised 10,000 in my area for people to go aid them.
1302630828724359169 2020-09-06 23:32:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> It's so disturbing to all of us when we see or hear a teacher who is teaching our children hate, and hate for law and order. I learned a lot when I ran a store beside a university, mental illness runs rampant in our youth. Does indoctrination cause it?

But a lot of the people who helped bush and Obama are there. Both globalist, our young officers are many indoctrinated.?
1302408964274040833 2020-09-06 08:51:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm going over to my daughters shop on the lake. Today they had thousands of Patriots turn out for boat Trump rally. Guest speakers, and tonight there will be music and food. To big a crowd for me, my daughter wants to go, so we're gonna stop in for a minute.
1302396191490150410 2020-09-06 08:00:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I wonder if most of the people watching CNN are conservatives. Their ratings are so low, the real enemy is Facebook, Google, Twitter.

1302339150159507457 2020-09-06 04:13:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> in rural America which is traditionally conservative. dems disguised as conservatives have snuck in and got elected. A lot of folks just voted for the republican, later finding out they're not conservative.I know it's true in PA were my daughter is.
1302334808853491712 2020-09-06 03:56:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I mentioned the other day my grandkids in PA wear masks to school, and have to carry a body shield in front of them. I called the local congresswoman, she has organized parents and over 500 are outside the school today protesting.
1302333926959185923 2020-09-06 03:52:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> 20 yrs ago I was on the board of an electric company Co op, gas company, water &amp; sewer and the phone company, all rural Co ops. We strictly voted and discussed financial issues for each Co op. I have friends on it today, they tell me it's now political.

1302328178300551170 2020-09-06 03:30:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> uncertain future for our country, when Potus gets re elected, we have to get them out of any position of authority. We must be active in school boards, city councils, mayors. We have allowed the dems to sneak in local positions that used to not matter
1302311901695803394 2020-09-06 02:25:27 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @No_to_NWO_belle It's that way in PA. People I have known my whole life quit talking to me. They think I'm dangerous because I support Potus.
1302311448576757760 2020-09-06 02:23:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Wray should be fired. Is their anyone Potus can trust in the fbi?
1302311065003405312 2020-09-06 02:22:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The insanity of this type of thinking. Do they really believe that?
1302310240394924034 2020-09-06 02:18:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @stephenllawson That's what I just completed and I'm up and running.
1302309837901041665 2020-09-06 02:17:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @brightlibra I did, she was polite and said science was leading her. I explained science is manipulated by those with an agenda. She has been taught her whole life to trust science. Didn't believe me, things I'm outdated
1302308733993865217 2020-09-06 02:12:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @stephenllawson I'm fighting water in my diesel
1302308550409105409 2020-09-06 02:12:08 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @brightlibra She's 18 from Nevada, went in this morning with intentions of triggering her. Talked to her, she really believes she's gonna die if everyone doesn't wear a mask. Her family watches and trusts msm
1302307050945470464 2020-09-06 02:06:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @stephenllawson Mine is the standard fuel, starter issue.
1302306805926825984 2020-09-06 02:05:12 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Were I live it's not split by ideology, is it were you live? Has the media, both sides manipulated us to believe we're that divided? Are we being pulled into the divisive belief? I know democrats, they're not like I see here or t.v. Are they were you live?
1302305444740968450 2020-09-06 01:59:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have been busy today fixing my tractor. If everyone including rich conservatives isn't involved in some conspiracy. Why wouldn't rich conservatives start social media? Why isn't half the news conservatives since the nation has split in half on issues?
1302243151126695936 2020-09-05 21:52:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The amount of people working against Potus and America is mind blowing. What do they all have to hide? Why would so many powerful people hate a president who has done more for America than any other
1302241517659193345 2020-09-05 21:45:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The media is a bigger threat to our national security than China
1302240511172935686 2020-09-05 21:41:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrats break the laws of our land, Treason, leaking intelligence info, encourage and participate in rioting. Lying, spying, on our own govt and people. When do they get held accountable?
1302237557737091072 2020-09-05 21:30:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @miles_commodore My name is Tonto
1302102591812374528 2020-09-05 12:33:44 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America, God bless all you amazing patriotic Americans. My daughter and  I are excited about  tonights fishing. We have 3 different baits, 6 poles and the weather is changing. Jesus Saves, it's a gift from God, it's so easy. Goodnight
1302101363749515264 2020-09-05 12:28:51 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Met some nice patriots at the event we went to. Their doing a boat parade around the lake Saturday &amp; Sunday.
1302085247576821768 2020-09-05 11:24:49 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @PAPPYL0VELL Agree
1302058708910866433 2020-09-05 09:39:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter and I just got invited to go eat at a big patriot event at the lake next to her store. BBQ brisket and fish, be back later. God bless America.
1302046837772349442 2020-09-05 08:52:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Most  people in our country are unaware of what's going on. They're like rabbits playing in a field surrounded by wolves. I get mad sometimes and want to grab them and say wake up. At the same time it makes me feel good to see them just going about their lives
1302040837413634048 2020-09-05 08:28:21 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I will not take the vaccine, I pray to God our children aren't forced to. We know covid 19 is a real flu. Just like any other flu compromised people die. Almost half the deaths NY&amp; PA nursing homes. Do you wonder if dems were intentional in these deaths?
1302039666112303104 2020-09-05 08:23:41 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> If the media was truthful, all Democrat politicians would be arrested. They wouldn't have a party, they would've been considered the communist party.Their so pompous and arrogant with their claims. When did our leaders all become gods
1302038314938236928 2020-09-05 08:18:19 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> What used to be considered outlandish crimes has become acceptable.Rioters, looters, burning businesses, attacking people is peaceful protesting. One of,if not the biggest enemy is the media. Everything is a manipulated lie.
1302035742273802240 2020-09-05 08:08:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> All this pedophile acceptance, trying to justify it or make it a minor crime. Are most of these powerful people pedophiles? Are they trying to make it normal, knowing they're going to get caught? It seems that way.
1302034829005987840 2020-09-05 08:04:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @SarahReam8 It's true
1302034520389095425 2020-09-05 08:03:14 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We know Potus is running on putting America first, Strong military, Defend the Blue, less Taxes, less regulations, creating jobs, strong borders,Better and cheaper medical, improve education, drain the swamp. Give the country back to the people Dems= chaos
1302032719694704645 2020-09-05 07:56:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @PollitoSu Lol, truth
1302032466291687424 2020-09-05 07:55:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I was talking to a 21 yr old, first time voter. I explained what Potus was doing for America, I told him he should investigate and get knowledgeable before voting. Then he asked what the dems were offering, I went blank. I said vote Trump, study next election
1302031330486751240 2020-09-05 07:50:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @SarahReam8 Lol, you got me, I forgot him
1302031199318179840 2020-09-05 07:50:03 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Is every Democrat politician unhinged? Are all Democrat voters that brainwashed or mentally ill. They flip flop from one lie to another in the same day, without blinking an eye They've changed positions so many times, what are they running on?
1302029114078003201 2020-09-05 07:41:45 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm beginning to wonder if they aren't that dumb
1301962736344223744 2020-09-05 03:18:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Got to go get a solenoid installed before it rains . Back later, God bless America
1301961071775842316 2020-09-05 03:11:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @HarryFagan5 I wanted to post a harsher criticism. His death is trending and the dems are feeding that on media. How Trump hates war hero. Just didn't want to give them any gasoline. So I did a mild slap.
1301958656301436928 2020-09-05 03:01:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @HarryFagan5 No, 69 Tactical air assault vet 69 to 72
1301958194600779783 2020-09-05 02:59:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @tesimsjr I can't stand Kerry either
1301957741519527937 2020-09-05 02:58:09 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @realiak1151 Agree, weak leader tho
1301957648045268992 2020-09-05 02:57:47 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The people who control our industries and media, medical, fake science,education. Most hate Potus and are flooding the dems bank accounts. They hate us as well when we challenge their ideas. They're challenged, we want control back.
1301956566162329600 2020-09-05 02:53:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Weakest presidents in my life, Jimmy Carter, Barrack Obama.
1301953971632906240 2020-09-05 02:43:10 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Just more elitist tools who hate the idea Potus is fighting for us to raise our standard of living
1301951633602088963 2020-09-05 02:33:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> They're consumed with hatred for anything good. Brainwashing really worked on them
1301950908318855172 2020-09-05 02:31:00 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @holtke123 She's done with it her machine the circuit broke
1301950039288410114 2020-09-05 02:27:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter made a thousand stickers and sold them all for 3 to  5 dollars. She raised and donated four thousand dollars. #SaveTheChildren  https://t.co/kzMnxlR24Q
1301947129913577472 2020-09-05 02:15:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm putting it out there, respected  McCain as a Veteran. As a politician, he was toilet paper.
1301945251372953603 2020-09-05 02:08:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @ChristensonSher @IvanTrowbridge @realDonaldTrump My heart goes out to you, I have a daughter and 5 grandkids under Democrat nazi ruler, Gov Wolf. The people in the dem states have to wake up and vote them out.
1301940811677028353 2020-09-05 01:50:53 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Karla83929684 I hope
1301938492948307973 2020-09-05 01:41:40 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I love Laura Loomer, She's a strong conservative woman who represents Americas values.Shes out in the trenches doing the work
1301937853820272646 2020-09-05 01:39:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I laugh everytime I see comrade Gates talking about saving the world. What a tool.
1301937577784729600 2020-09-05 01:38:02 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @realDonaldTrump Sir open up America. Let the Democrats stay closed if they choose. We don't want our taxpayer money going to their cities and states. Democrats have ruined their own economies.
1301921127200161792 2020-09-05 00:32:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Fauci is the weasel in the hen house for the dems. People trust him as nonpartisan, We know he's a libtard globalist
1301920729341079552 2020-09-05 00:31:05 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Karla83929684 Stop making me giddy
1301919357438767105 2020-09-05 00:25:37 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I knew I was going back to Dunkin donuts again, so I went prepared. In case the screecher girl would win today on the mask war. I brought a trigger mask. Didn't use it but I was ready  https://t.co/jIZOw3Q0JY
1301918145217781760 2020-09-05 00:20:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I have been weak on pointing out Camela Harris many weak points. I'm gathering as much info as I can on her, I just want to be fair and balanced. Lol. I hope everyone is getting out this weekend and breathing fresh air. God Bless America!
1301916183260803072 2020-09-05 00:13:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I don't know about you folks, but I thought Potus speech in PA last night was a grand slam. It sealed PA for us, it was honest and a strong msg, by a strong leader. Many dems in PA that were on the fence, they jumped over last night.
1301915065717796864 2020-09-05 00:08:34 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> My daughter and I caught 11 channel cats last night on night crawlers. Big pressure drop tonight, we're getting shad, chicken livers and night crawlers. 3 rods each with different bait on each. I can't wait, I'm due a big night.
1301913571660648448 2020-09-05 00:02:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> We're focused on Biden, He's already exposed. I feel like he's running like a blocker to protect the nominee Harris. She Appeases the radical side of the dems. Bidens affiliation makes her seem moderate to the other dems.she's  an unknown to the average voter
1301912355417337861 2020-09-04 23:57:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> dem voters know Bidens mind is bad, they don't know Kamala Harris. Many dem insiders informed me the parties hopes are her.We talk about her record as a prosecutor, many see her as tough on crime. We can't let her go unattacked, they're counting on that.
1301910995791761409 2020-09-04 23:52:24 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The Democrats are internally fighting, they're feasting on each other.  They have zero idea of what to do, they have no platform to run on. People don't care about the fake climate scam anymore. Jobs,law &amp; order are the issues today.
1301909815070019584 2020-09-04 23:47:42 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I had to go back to get more tractor parts, so I went back to the dunkin donuts. Walked in, no mask the same girl is there, she screams for the Mgr. Place is full today with maskers. Mgr comes out says LG coffee, yep. Girl stared at me with death looks. Lol
1301752446113460224 2020-09-04 13:22:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all you wonderful Patriots. My daughter and I are at the fishing hole tonight with nigh crawlers, we've been catching 2 to 6 a night. Due that big night soon,  Jesus Saves my friends, it's simple. Goodnight &amp; God bless
1301739310681665541 2020-09-04 12:30:11 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Yep
1301736469585956864 2020-09-04 12:18:54 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Sounds like fun at this point
1301732724579934209 2020-09-04 12:04:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Amen, pray for the blue now
1301732204272398336 2020-09-04 12:01:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I feel okay about that

1301698020527009793 2020-09-04 09:46:07 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Our young people need to be able to dream, have opportunity and hope in their futures. Potus will restore America back to greatness and opportunity for all people. We have seen what he's done under constant attack.4 more years and clean up govt
1301696430483148807 2020-09-04 09:39:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm still hyped. on Potus speech, PA once a great state has turned into a bed of govt assistance. It's a struggle to make a life in most of the state. Under Democrat policies they've been losing so long, it's the norm. Many dem places the same
1301694428688584707 2020-09-04 09:31:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @ReadMoreBible Planting seeds prayerfully
1301683391356694528 2020-09-04 08:47:59 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Potus blew it out of the water in PA. He makes you proud to be supporting him. He truly loves and cares about everyone in America. What a time to be alive, all the destruction to our country by Democrats. Potus will fix it with our help. God bless America
1301663251063865345 2020-09-04 07:27:57 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @chessie1963 @Melrc1971 We got rain and wind up to 60, just a windy thunderstorm. Power out for a day
1301649016221040641 2020-09-04 06:31:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I so badly want all this racial division fueled by the democrats to end.I also want all these criminals in our streets rounded up, no exceptions. I hope we can get term limits, Protect the integrity of our flag and history.And unite the country
1301647055790714881 2020-09-04 06:23:36 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @TheLeoTerrell I enjoy your honest tenacity on important issues. I watch everytime I know your on a show. Keep up the good work for America
1301646219505270784 2020-09-04 06:20:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @ricksheatcool @catturd2 My thinking exactly

1301633702175354880 2020-09-04 05:30:32 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Cdc, AHA, ALA, AMA are all phony organizations. The charaties are all fake, dig in and check it out. Their money comes from pharmaceutical, Big Tobacco and Gates, Bloomberg. These people direct a liberal agenda thru these groups
1301632447835185152 2020-09-04 05:25:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The democrats are losing badly and continuing the fear mongering. Now they're threatening violence if Biden doesn't win. They're already encouraging violence. After the election,we the people will not tolerate their threats anymore.
1301628729001742336 2020-09-04 05:10:46 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Read every word

1301575006422536194 2020-09-04 01:37:18 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I bet the people in the face shield business didn't see this coming. Probably had warehouses of shields, and now can't keep up with demand. I'm working on designing full body shields now just in case.😎
1301573799394111488 2020-09-04 01:32:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @Melrc1971 We don't wear them in my County, buffets open, theater open

1301566128192466947 2020-09-04 01:02:01 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I was in a town 30 miles from me to pick up a tractor part. I went to a dunking donuts to get coffee, a young girl screeched, you have to have a mask. The Mgr came out, I said may I have a LG coffee, he said sure. She's in tears, says why did I move to Texas
1301553257601536000 2020-09-04 00:10:52 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @NYCMayor @realDonaldTrump America is not paying for your poor leadership. The people of New York should hunt you down and run you our of town. Wilhelm
1301546451407863808 2020-09-03 23:43:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @tedwheeler We're not paying for your poor performance as a do nothing mayor. Hopefully your voters will pick someone more intelligent. You should resign or be run out of town
1301545834065035265 2020-09-03 23:41:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrat politicians have repeatedly threatened the president. But anyone going to New York would need an armed guard under nazi coumos kingship
1301545228638334979 2020-09-03 23:38:58 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Really good summary of the situation
1301544584326111234 2020-09-03 23:36:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrats seem to enjoy this life. They vote for politicians who give them want
1301509429444194304 2020-09-03 21:16:43 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Pro sports are a disgrace to America
1301508702722293760 2020-09-03 21:13:50 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I agree, I was fortunate enough to have met him. What heroes ball players used to be. Willie Mayes was my hero as a kid. Got to eat dinner with him as an adult. Todays sports are dead played by mostly entitled stooges
1301375485297991680 2020-09-03 12:24:28 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @tedwheeler That's because you poorly handled the situation. Why should we pay for your poor leadership. If you worked a real job, you would be fired.
1301374959613345799 2020-09-03 12:22:23 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> God bless America and all you wonderful people. It rained a little today, the creeks up. My daughter and I are walking to the fishing hole. We got chicken livers  to feed the fish. Jesus Saves completely, it's easy. Goodnight God bless

1301325103939162112 2020-09-03 09:04:16 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> democrats are desperate, everything they've tryed has back fired.The shutdown has to end, Govenors are playing it safe for political reasons.

1301010691206402049 2020-09-02 12:14:55 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Once the insurance money runs out, you gotta pay till your savings is gone. If you own anything they put judgements on it. Got that all covered and living a blessed wonderful life. Active 7 days a week. This election is for my grandkids.
1301009812281536514 2020-09-02 12:11:25 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Back in April my wife lost her mind, didn't know me anymore. It had been going on 10 yrs, I was ready for it. No need for sadness, it happens and I'm happy. Had to put my stuff in my daughters name or lose my home to a nursing home.
1301007719466442752 2020-09-02 12:03:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> The market is inflated, traditionally means big money thinks Trumps gonna win. That's what's driving our market, rich folks betting on the election. If you understand it, a good time to make money. I don't gamble anymore or have the money
1301006825719029760 2020-09-02 11:59:33 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> In my professional career costs and overheads, profit margins. A complete understanding of every aspect of that business.

1300995930397847555 2020-09-02 11:16:15 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I want to vote on everything govt does. My area is closing down a beautiful park of 80 yrs. It has an outdoor theater stage, benches carved in rocks, movie screen, tennis courts. We have 16 parks and want to build another one. We should vote
1300989733502365696 2020-09-02 10:51:38 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I'm thinking of running in 2024, I'm 68 and I would be 72. Probably slightly Senile, who cares. Biden running has been a poster child for us older folks. What did I say? Nevermind. That's how I perceive Biden running for President.

1300863013768044546 2020-09-02 02:28:06 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> @LindaNDanny Democrats put in a regulation for ecigs to be in a category with cigarettes. Ecigs contain no tobacco. Dem states reap billions off cigarette sales. That regulation takes effect next Tuesday.

1300861853795581955 2020-09-02 02:23:29 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Democrats have shown us what they offer. Dem mayors Wheeler &amp; Deblasio rioting in the streets, while the other dems encouraged burning and looting. All in Democrat cities and states, no red states in chaos. Over 50% of all covid deaths were in 5 dem states

Biden Harris means a loss of your freedoms. Democrats have betrayed there own voters encouraging violence in dem cities and states.

1300849565550211072 2020-09-02 01:34:39 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Many ecigs are already approved. Owned by big tobacco and rich dems. Small business Americans started it in 2007. Zero deaths from ecigs.all American made. Dems rigged it for big tobacco to control it. Voters are out there on this.
1300848731395444736 2020-09-02 01:31:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> 13,000 adult ecig shops with over 20 million users are closing next week due to a dem regulation.

1300847975221133312 2020-09-02 01:28:20 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Bloomberg put up 50 MIL to discredit American ecig industry. Then he developed his own ecig to sell. Potus,all republican congress supports ecigs. The info put out on them was dem lies. I'm mentioning it because TX, FL CA, and  swing state votes are in it
1300846833179283458 2020-09-02 01:23:48 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> I quit cigarettes 9 yrs ago using ecigs. Any of you? Before you criticize ecigs, remember the same lying dems and there people created the false info on ecigs. Dem states make billions off cigs which kills 1300 in America daily

1300837447115452425 2020-09-02 00:46:30 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Joe Biden and the entire Democrat party encouraged the rioters to continue. 40 yrs I listened to your lies. Democrat cities and states are in turmoil. No republican states are. You can't create jobs just chaos #WalkAway
1300836697232551936 2020-09-02 00:43:31 +0800 <USATRUMPMAN1> Lying piece of crap. Your party which I left after 40 yrs has turned anti American.
