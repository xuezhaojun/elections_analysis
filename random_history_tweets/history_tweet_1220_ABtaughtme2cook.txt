What I mean:  "I'm going to ignore all DMs -- fair warning. When I enforce that on my non-to-minorly creepy followers, don't be surprised (and don't unfollow/@ me)."

Many GOP in leg *have* let down USA &amp; misled POTUS by keeping silent, allowing him to inflict his "fraud" fantasy beyond mid-Nov.

Not just b/c he's stubborn, but b/c he believes he has evidence &amp; facts on his side.  This is how twisted his mind is: - FACT: I'm the best at everything. - FACT: It's impossible for me to lose. - EVIDENCE: Vote counts say Biden won. - CONCLUSION: Rigged.

1332955323242606592 2020-11-29 15:51:28 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> To my knowledge, he always signed his pics with the "is" in there.  And I believe that consistent "branding" succeeded in making *everyone* aware of who was really under that mask  ... regardless of the voice you heard or the face you saw.  R.I.P. David Prowse

1332928149961715713 2020-11-29 14:03:30 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @ashleyroybal Ash -- I know what you meant.  I'm literally having fun with your words here. Not "making" fun "of" them.  You could let it take your mind off things, as you choose. ‚úåÔ∏è
1332926615865659392 2020-11-29 13:57:24 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> We lost another one...
1332925760638754816 2020-11-29 13:54:00 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> And I'm sure he does not like this, Sam-I-Am! hehehe, good!
1332925428969955328 2020-11-29 13:52:41 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @AOC says it all!
1332925340713414656 2020-11-29 13:52:20 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> I retweeted it anyway!  muhahahahahahahahaaaaaaa
1332924886243807232 2020-11-29 13:50:32 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @VoteBH_2020 this also just got you another follower
1332923939400658947 2020-11-29 13:46:46 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> I think, deep down -- even if we didn't think about it -- we knew this was coming...
1332923566824837122 2020-11-29 13:45:17 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @ashleyroybal Time for Fun with Words and Punctuation ...  People are more "often" than "not good."  Makes no sense. That's the fun of it!
1332922470064590848 2020-11-29 13:40:56 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @ashleyroybal Ignoring your fun tangent FTM... You've hit upon a good distinction. Loss is loss, like water is wet. Just is. Rejection is only used to make something personal ... about you. And usually a choice to use it.  ergo, let's see if we can convert all perceived "rejection" into "loss"
1332920108432363522 2020-11-29 13:31:32 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @pixienic Nah. They out there. They in here.  Except in here they can pretend to be other-than, and duplicate their presence.  Still comes out to 1 pathological person in the chair.
1332912516603719682 2020-11-29 13:01:22 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @nukedukem82 BTW, while I have your attention, I just gotta say -- as a casual old gamer -- I just love the Duke Nukem references you use. üéÆ‚úåÔ∏è  https://t.co/KvgEVLJfLd
1332911335642894341 2020-11-29 12:56:41 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @ashleyroybal Ash, at this moment you have 5,082 followers on Twitter.  You were already, at minimum, almost famous.  That said, though I'm in the east and had never heard of him before now, I totally get what you're sayin' here.
1332907605640048642 2020-11-29 12:41:52 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @ashleyroybal I'm sure lots do.
1332907036397473793 2020-11-29 12:39:36 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @ashleyroybal Deal, hon! (BTW, that's a local term of any level of endearment where I'm from.)
1332905990753296388 2020-11-29 12:35:27 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Donny52291554 Or ~2600 shouts.  Hippo-Bird-Day!
1332905846410518531 2020-11-29 12:34:52 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @staceys5551 Buckle up, but you'll get through this. We'll do whatever we can from here.
1332905720698855424 2020-11-29 12:34:22 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Good vibes needed here...
1332887312263503872 2020-11-29 11:21:13 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @nukedukem82 üëçüëç
1332886811283247105 2020-11-29 11:19:14 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @EricTrump Yup ... millions of us. Your father is just that hated that people who NEVER voted before did their part to defeat him (that means "make him a LOSER," Eric).  Heh, "hardly campaigning" ... imagine how much worse your fathers LOSS would have been had Biden campaigned more. (duh)

1332880985420148738 2020-11-29 10:56:05 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @DenDonally Good luck! See ya back here, soon!
1331840131100274688 2020-11-26 14:00:06 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @CherryDank Funny, I had to explain this to the kids just a few hours ago.  Was showing them Apollo 13.  There's a scene where "Ken" the cancelled 'naut (Gary Sinese) has had it with the TV coverage (pre-"problems") and does this to the phone on the way to bed.
1331834346056134661 2020-11-26 13:37:07 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @princessamiira Right there with ya, so I'm going to go with:  Not weird -- normal.  ü§™ü§™ü§™
1331834006749450243 2020-11-26 13:35:46 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Good one!
1331833561826152453 2020-11-26 13:34:00 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @princessamiira And I just *now* noticed you just followed me @princessamiira so you are in fact #1600 for me.  Thank you.
1331833181918605312 2020-11-26 13:32:29 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @princessamiira Hey, wow, (since you brought this up) I just noticed I'm exactly at 1,600 followers rn.  For me, that's pretty good. Nice.
1331832800157298691 2020-11-26 13:30:58 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @KristenM777 Not just "yay" but "yahooo!"  In fact, I'm making it from practically all from scratch in an iron skillet within a few hours.  That's my favorite version.
1331832098299260931 2020-11-26 13:28:11 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @princessamiira I'd guess: concerns about their tweets getting buried and reaching anyone and/or concerns over getting shadow-banned.  I suppose if I had a large following and a decent number of my posts got practically zero response/RT/likes, I'd wonder if they were being displayed in feeds.
1331830887386910721 2020-11-26 13:23:22 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> My answer is: not a thing
1331830621660999680 2020-11-26 13:22:19 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @darafaye In fact, I hear this in my head in a British accent for some reason.  "I just had an week bit of an ice roller on my face, when I looked up and saw Blanche and Nigel semi-casually ambling in my direction. Had they seen me?"
1331829038541844480 2020-11-26 13:16:01 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @JaceHood__ ahhhhhhhhh, no.  https://t.co/lNTf2L6lYl

1331828290030592000 2020-11-26 13:13:03 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @trschmidt85 I think we're going pieless this year.
1331827864421998593 2020-11-26 13:11:21 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @darafaye I swear -- 100% honesty -- upon 1st read, I thought "an ice roller on my face" was a colorful (or possibly even "international") way of saying...  "I just slipped on ice, face-first, but rolled out of it."  And I'm still giggling at that interpretation.
1331823498663170048 2020-11-26 12:54:00 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @PrncplExtrovert Good luck! Wise choice.

1331095732170973184 2020-11-24 12:42:07 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Well, at least she was correct once.  Now she is what she despised. And doesn't act like she sees that.
1331094807738011649 2020-11-24 12:38:27 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @TerryMeggins @Brasilmagic @TrumperWavin I ALMOST wrote a real reply to this, as if "RTM" is a real normal person. But data says otherwise  I tweet fairly regular; get 11%. To get a 70% here, you gotta hit it like a job prob WITH bot help. +This was the most human on this thread.

1331089301766107138 2020-11-24 12:16:34 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> well put
1331084776434962432 2020-11-24 11:58:35 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> About time something felt awesome in 2020...
1331033988568379392 2020-11-24 08:36:46 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Year 2020 is the Apollo 13 of years.  Only with a fvck-ton more death.  Just don't ask, "What else could go..."  ... well, you know.
1331033155214700545 2020-11-24 08:33:28 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Got that right, Mooch!
1331031632250368004 2020-11-24 08:27:25 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @wineaintsweeter Ah, I see, thanks! Also, I didn't realize he was such a dick.
1331030761412104192 2020-11-24 08:23:57 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @TEBC_inPA Yeah, I've seen. Thanks for the clarify. I just can't stomach it. :)
1331029699577962508 2020-11-24 08:19:44 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @wineaintsweeter I can tell I've missed something in my (brief) absence.

1331028865863585793 2020-11-24 08:16:25 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> _I_ heard it here FIRST!  Wowsie-wow-wow! I did NOT see that coming!
1331004901229473795 2020-11-24 06:41:11 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> On a lighter note, I came across this one. Glad to see I'm not the only one who wants a few breaths to absorb a movie, listen to the music, and watch though to the actual end.  Plus, the creators deserve it.  https://t.co/JyfGpzxJOu
1331001650237018115 2020-11-24 06:28:16 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @whollyfool Well, it's not everyone.  Followers is the only "currency" one can even make up exists on this platform.  It just exposes the depth of the human needs of some to have a currency, any currency, or perceived power to lord over others.
1331000681185087490 2020-11-24 06:24:25 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Julius_Kim Thank goodness!  Since everyone appears to be "OK," now I recommend y'all go see a chiropractor. Best thing I've ever done after an accident (sans major injuries, of course). Never had the predicted post-accident-morning aches &amp; pains.

1330791651011399681 2020-11-23 16:33:49 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> This is a very, VERY good point. (also, Sarah is awesome *and* very funny)
1330791398212333569 2020-11-23 16:32:48 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @MysterySolvent Um ... no.  That much seems fairly obvious.  To feel those things: 1) you have to be able to feel something 2) you have to realize you've done something "wrong"  Both of those criteria are beyond is capabilities.

1330783534139764737 2020-11-23 16:01:33 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Tachyon100 @UROCKlive1 By definition, if one is still his follower, after everything publicly presented for 4+ years, that answer would be a hard "no."
1330782491825889280 2020-11-23 15:57:25 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @BoomerOtis I think we have other more obvious things to worry about 1st. But appropriately prioritizing it isn't necessarily a political tactic nor "letting it go."  We'll deal w/ the crazies eventually, but doesn't have to be Day 1.

1327516886955855873 2020-11-14 15:41:04 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> I might lose followers over this, but it needs to be said. I find it extremely disrespectful when people don't stand for the national anthem. As soon as you hear, "A modern-day warrior, mean-mean stride..." you need to be on your feet.
1327516146120220673 2020-11-14 15:38:07 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @KBlackDesigns Went with "irony" on that one?  Once saw Def Lepard, 2nd row, in the round. Love their music. But they ain't my fave either, and that one in particular isn't my fave DF anyway (Photograph is).

1327492048887443456 2020-11-14 14:02:22 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @RagsII A woman in full labor gets wheeled onto the ward shouting, "Shouldn't! Couldn't! Wouldn't! Can't! Won't! Don't!"  The first nurse to see her shouts, "This one's having contractions!"
1327488924508413952 2020-11-14 13:49:57 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @darafaye Buzz ain't bad ... he's only "drawn that way" (Jessica Rabbit ref) üòÅ  But seriously, the awesomeness of the character is in how he's written, and most of the awesomeness of the performance came from the animators.
1327488161031860224 2020-11-14 13:46:55 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @darafaye Hey, just don't let it.  Buzz is a character, not the man.  Buzz is awesome.  At least it's not like my childhood entertainment hero, who's comedy albums I owned in total, saw him live, and was so proud for everyone to finally see his genius via his hit TV show: Bill Cosby. ü§¨
1327487237852983296 2020-11-14 13:43:15 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @darafaye @Martyha1 I guess you didn't catch the controversy a few years back about networks dropping his latest TV show because he plays a conservative/Republican ... until some network picked it up &amp; kept it.  That's when I caught on.  Bright Side: Never seen him be like a James Woods about it.
1327485761197838339 2020-11-14 13:37:23 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @KBlackDesigns @KatMeanJean @SandiDeMita I'm so sorry you had to live through this. I'm so sorry for your loss ... of your childhood. It shouldn't be allowed to happen to any child, much less with it being known/in the open.

1327476712398086146 2020-11-14 13:01:26 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Look, y'all, today's presser was the beginning of this plan. Show the public they have a gift-wrapped vaccine that is supposedly safe &amp; effective. Here's the rest of the trump's plan to make Biden look worse than him (don't fall for it when it drops):  https://t.co/ztpc01Cfwa
1327375118071443457 2020-11-14 06:17:44 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> There is definitely such a thing as hanging onto something too long...
1327374640612773889 2020-11-14 06:15:50 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> I've only now just realized:  donald j. trump can be correctly called a "passive serial killer."  Strange phrase, I know.  An "active" serial killer, you know, goes out and kills people.  trump sets up / allows conditions that lead to mass casualties and then just watches.
1327373622013546499 2020-11-14 06:11:47 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Maddog4Biden It's over now, but I never thought he would anyway.

1327020865695997958 2020-11-13 06:50:03 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Cozy1950 Depends on how his base feels about that &amp; how many "true" supporters there really are. I have a feeling we'll have to wait until the next GOP Primaries to prove to the GOP sissies that trump's base isn't that strong.  I mean, a total of 4 protesters in DC to Stop the Steal.

1325639762506608640 2020-11-09 11:22:03 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> See, here‚Äôs the thing: the voters in KY &amp; NC do largely vote GOP. IIWII.

I don't want him out on insanity defense  I'd go w/ unfeeling, amoral, arrogant, basically lacking everything that makes one human beyond bodily functions  But he knows exactly how to lie &amp; cheat; he knows it's wrong and just doesn't care. He was taught to "win" @ any cost
1324856813678972928 2020-11-07 07:30:53 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> trump couldn't even cheat his way out of this one ... but the a-hole sure tried as hard as possible
1324852346548047874 2020-11-07 07:13:08 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @SharesTruth Eye-opener for me was this theory:  pro-Joes voted COVID based on controlling it 1st; pro-trumps voted COVID based on fear of shutting down economy &amp; their livelihoods  Each side consumed their favored media, and I'd say "they" didn't look at, think about, or trust anything else
1324845877958160391 2020-11-07 06:47:26 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @SharesTruth Well, a few million less than half, so that's a bit heartening.  But, yeah, it should have been at least 80/20 against trump.
1324813809920462850 2020-11-07 04:40:00 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Maddog4Biden I wouldn't teach my kid to do this to his bro, say over vidgames, but given the grief we got FROM ADULTS for 4yrs of fake inaugural pics, misleading 2016 maps, WWE smackdowns, LIBERATE, snowflakes &amp; Cry more, libs  .. you're never gonna reconcile w/ this dick, so I say GO FOR IT!

1324756362866380807 2020-11-07 00:51:44 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Why TF does any Republican feel the need to cater to trump supporters?

1324505045619122181 2020-11-06 08:13:05 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Purported WH staff pro-democracy Republicans say (during trumps presser):
1324502059727675392 2020-11-06 08:01:13 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> #SpankyMcDumbass / trump says "miraculously" the mail-in votes are largely for Biden. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  The only "miracle" is how he's still in office after politicizing a deadly pandemic and telling his people that mail-in voting is bad, both of which OBVIOUSLY CAUSED that exact condition.
1324497869831897090 2020-11-06 07:44:34 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> trump will say/do ANYTHING to win. We all know this much by now. Let's see if trump mentions unrest at his (now late) presser.

1324465400835383297 2020-11-06 05:35:33 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Meanwhile @kaitlancollins reports that trump is being practically physically "restrained" from speaking publicly. The only reason he appears "restrained."  The lawyers know he will blow up their cases with anything he wants to say.  So I say, LET THE PRESIDENT SPEAK!
1324464054740680708 2020-11-06 05:30:12 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Rick Santorum thinks that "for donald trump, he's being very restrained" right now.  Like, yay?  Yeah, he tweets, too, yadda yadda.

1324425403424034820 2020-11-06 02:56:37 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @imkarenb Yeah, I didn't think that speaker would make a partisan statement. I was hoping he indicated what type or other clue &amp; news would analyze that.  I'm off today so I can pan around. Sorry to keep you away from work. :)
1324424844717494272 2020-11-06 02:54:24 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @libum_populi @EclecticRadical @peterdaou Mostly true enough. But the pandemic barely played a part, except as far as it kept Joe off the campaign trail &amp; elevated mail-in voting.  As an issue, we are so polarized, Dems voted based on trump botched COVID, but GOP voted based on fear of Biden botching economic recovery.
1324423758652809222 2020-11-06 02:50:05 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @libum_populi @EclecticRadical @peterdaou TBH Bernie shot the entire progressive movement in the foot when he allowed the use of "socialism" as a term to in any way describe what he was up to.  He should have squashed that right from the get-go and insisted on calling it "progressive" (or literally anything else)
1324422124208050177 2020-11-06 02:43:35 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Hey, @imkarenb (putting you on the spot), did you listen keenly enough to get what happened w/ the double-counted votes?   And when corrected, do we know if that correction helped or hurt Biden? He probably didn't say that much but I don't see the news covering it rn.
1324420830756032513 2020-11-06 02:38:27 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @libum_populi @EclecticRadical @peterdaou Case in point: Cubans voting against Biden, obviously not b/c they know &amp; love his helpful policies, but b/c trump painted Biden as "Socialist" by assoc w/ AOC &amp; Bernie ... that was enough.
1324420070429306880 2020-11-06 02:35:25 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @libum_populi @EclecticRadical @peterdaou Seeing what's happening rn, if you think the ppl vote based on policies, I don't know what to tell you. That's the reality disconnect here.  These votes were based on fear &amp; liking a "strong leader." Ppl have long voted for ppl they "like" who vote against their self-interests.
1324418048040800261 2020-11-06 02:27:23 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> He literally just told someone to "look at the website for that" ... politically correct equivalent of "Google it!"  hehe ... ask him things you can't get from your phone
1324417743806976001 2020-11-06 02:26:11 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @imkarenb "I would have thought you would have taken down the information I'm providing" (or something close to that)

Men who recognize emotions and forgive faults are apparently Biden voters.

1324213178583179264 2020-11-05 12:53:19 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> On TV, Kaitlan said trump was calling &amp; yelling at these Governors re: the vote.  Upon hearing this, my grade school kid told me, "If trump played baseball and flied-out to the outfield, he would probably go out &amp; yell at the outfielder for wrecking his game  Even the kids get it
1324206365120827395 2020-11-05 12:26:14 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> .@jaketapper trump is filing frivolous lawsuits because he's trying to "run out the clock" &amp; get this election decided by another body (contingencies). he doesn't have to win them; just tie up certifications.

I was thinking of, say, 10 Republicans, but a few have a backbone  Given one of the core tenets of conservatism appears to be "machismo," that doesn't work well in groups.

1324189356609970176 2020-11-05 11:18:39 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @RCownie @Cozy1950 @RoguePOTUSStaff True enough. My fear makes The McConnell Assumption: that all GOP lawmakers will put Party over Country, just as they've done for 4 years. A Dem win in that scenario requires an entire GOP Delegation w/backbone.  Maybe GOP House members are significantly different? But in groups?
1324188362568327168 2020-11-05 11:14:42 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @AustinFoustCPA @Cozy1950 @RoguePOTUSStaff Exactly. Dems have more Representatives but fewer states represented in the House.  This is a special rule just for "throwing a POTUS election to the House"

1324165596003577856 2020-11-05 09:44:14 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @RUB1G @RoguePOTUSStaff trump totally would. he doesn‚Äôt care. Not his $$ (as usual). And no one in Congress or DOJ can/will do anything about it.

1323993811048140800 2020-11-04 22:21:37 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @RandiLittle20 I don‚Äôt count OAN or talk radio (long been around). Everyone getting the same message is partly addressed in that dock.  But not getting through to them starts with a POTUS who immediately discredited all media that doesn‚Äôt agree with him. Then we‚Äôre powerless to agree on facts.
1323992167761825794 2020-11-04 22:15:06 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @jeneuhausphoto Loki was right (sadly)  In every fighting video game, the big bad guy has 1000s of faceless minions who don‚Äôt think for themselves or question their leader.  That didn‚Äôt seem real to me... until the last 11 hours or so. I was so sure of trump rejection after seeing him do the job

He actually thinks he is CEO of USA. So everyone in it answers to him or they're fired. His power is "absolute" (he's said).  Ever notice the way he says "your president"?  He did it again tonight.

1323888032014098434 2020-11-04 15:21:18 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Oh, God ... here come the trumps ...
1323887528752152577 2020-11-04 15:19:18 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @RandiLittle20 I gotcha. But you ended on a completely separate issue. I don‚Äôt consider Fox vs. CNN,MSNBC,ABC,CBS,NBC as ‚Äúdivided‚Äù ... but how ppl get info thru their phones is just where life is.  Seen ‚ÄúThe Social Dilemma‚Äù? We only get what we agree with. THAT‚ÄôS the impossible news issue.

1323882102883000320 2020-11-04 14:57:44 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @PreetBharara That IS the question. (NOT to be or not to be)
1323880446313332736 2020-11-04 14:51:09 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @RandiLittle20 Comment &amp; Question: For one thing, a ripe population with a moral leader does not become fascist.  So, that helps + virus gets some control.  Q: By "division in media" do you mean Fox vs. everyone else?
1323879232741744640 2020-11-04 14:46:20 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> OF COURSE this isn't a morally-sound, easy blow-out, early night!  OF COURSE this will likely be won in court over days+!  BECAUSE  ........  2020!
1323875202330185730 2020-11-04 14:30:19 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> üö® If trump wins, it means there are A LOT of ppl, distributed throughout the USA, who are just plain gullible. They will believe anything they're told, from what they *think* is a trusted source, if it plays to their set world view &amp; fears.  And that is a crowd ripe for fascism.

1323871800133066757 2020-11-04 14:16:48 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @imkarenb @RoguePOTUSStaff I think someone else had to correct it FOR him. he would just type, stick his nose up and walk away like he's busting through other world leaders.  Then when the media gets hold of it, his servants have to clean up after him (like usual).
1323869899475877894 2020-11-04 14:09:15 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> This is the point. he says whatever helps him in the moment, damn the inconsistencies with previous statements, proving he doesn't have any position at all beyond instant gratification

1323867479828029440 2020-11-04 13:59:38 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> THIS is the obvious fact that seems to escape the stable genius (in his own mind)
1323867310386499585 2020-11-04 13:58:57 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @nycsouthpaw Favor? Willing to snapshot his tweets instead?  Not only would that be impervious to deletion, but then it doesn't add to his RT count (and possibly his Like count if I like yours, or his RT count if I RT) ... and we know he uses these #s to claim ppl agree w/ him, feel good,etc
1323866235663167489 2020-11-04 13:54:41 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @AndrewFeinberg @SpiroAgnewGhost Funny!  I would have RT it if you only had the pix, but you RT'd him directly, so I just can't (it adds to his numbers and creates evidence that ppl like what he said)

1323854348733030400 2020-11-04 13:07:27 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @thesismum @RoguePOTUSStaff From ANY SANE POV, Biden is mod-left.  Only from an extreme Right position does he look like the Far Left from there.  And I won't even say "trump's position" b/c that is just: say literally any syllables that will produce "win"
1323853465748185089 2020-11-04 13:03:56 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @RoguePOTUSStaff CNN finally just now agreed

1323851055952789504 2020-11-04 12:54:22 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @theamazingtif @RoguePOTUSStaff Sadly true.  But to borrow from the GOP position on healthcare, I don't deserve what a large group of Kool-Aid drunk covidiots have to dish out.

I've manged to organize my tech to have CNN, MSNBC, Fox, and Univision all up at the same time, with CNN audio louder and MSNBC soft.  Glad to see McSally losing, BTW.

1323839230561427456 2020-11-04 12:07:22 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @ValentinaEmarti @RoguePOTUSStaff I still remember Tim Russert with a mini-white board for the 2000 election.  John King is the modern version of that, with much better tech.  And that makes me respect Tim Russert even more for doing everything in his head (but unable to go county-level minute-by-minute).

1323549192690769920 2020-11-03 16:54:52 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @JoJoFromJerz I started to feel more optimistic after midnight.  O justification or idea why.  https://t.co/TgREc07lgP
1323548113055920129 2020-11-03 16:50:35 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @LVaddict618 Well, I didn't say it SUCCESSFULLY humanized him. üòä

1323547018376216576 2020-11-03 16:46:14 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @AMikofsky Oh, it's the pic across the top of your Profile page. Above the circular avatar pic.
1323546475180285952 2020-11-03 16:44:04 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @LVaddict618 I think his handlers want to humanize him, and this is the closest thing to emotion they've been able to record of him for the last 20 years.

Joe's Juniors makes me think of a minty candy for some reason.  &lt;I hope you know I'm kidding around with you here, BB. Keeping it all light rn. No offense intended &gt;
1323538359147548672 2020-11-03 16:11:49 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @peaceful09 This has an "wow, why didn't I think of that?" ring to it.   The #Persistence ... I have to say that's my favorite answer so far ... out of only 3 replies, but I think it has staying power...
1323535253865177093 2020-11-03 15:59:29 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @BrenBreithaupt "Capacitors" sounds electrifying! I'm all a-shudder now.  The People ... is that like The Village People but, you know, missing something? Something I need to raise my child, maybe?

Well, here's a new one I saw last night... the trump's campaign may be doing this on purpose to create a shared experience that bonds those people together stronger (and then I suppose that's transferrable to him)  Crazy idea, but really, what's NOT possible with trump?

1323485209577295873 2020-11-03 12:40:37 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> ... right after Trudeau lets the Chinese declare them innocent, sends them home, and claims credit for it.  OH! That's right. Justin is a good human who would never do that! Sorry, after 4 years of trump, I almost forgot some 1st-world leaders actually have values &amp; integrity.

1323482891419082753 2020-11-03 12:31:25 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @OllieMathews14 @_AyaHijazi_ Speaking of reality, you're not "real" ... not a real person, at least.  I mean, I guess a computer program is "real" as far as that goes.  But, you weren't a good enough program to be believable.  Maybe your programmer will do better next time. #BlockTheBots  https://t.co/X3mBBSoiBf

Do you like to being told by the ER doc, "*I* saved your life, you know. Not the EMTs who brought you in or the nurses who watched you round the clock. Me, got it?"  I like being thanked for doing my job WITHOUT asking for it or pointing out the speck in someone else's eye

YOU: "I left the tip. Not the rest of my party." "I taught you, not your previous teacher."  But why would we be surprised? That's par for someone who can only manage to act human 34% of the time. #BlockTheBots  https://t.co/t4vnQzEEDf

No one ever imagined the complicity of Senators &amp; powerful biased ‚Äúnews‚Äù channel.

He's diplomatic enough not to act like a typical trump supporter.  He didn't give me a hard time about not attending Father's Day. Instead of arguing about the virus, he only offered: no one knows what to believe anymore
1323373661370437632 2020-11-03 05:17:22 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> TRUTH! Don't underestimate this! Party in power draws the strangest lines to sufficiently splinter the opposing voters, making it near-impossible for their party to lose a state election ever again. THAT is NOT democracy.
1323373049819893761 2020-11-03 05:14:56 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> On the eve of Election, I'm sitting here wondering, if #BidenHarris2020 wins, how quickly things will go back to normal and I end up unfollowing some former resisters b/c we disagree on something more benign?  But for now, a common enemy is a powerful thing. Is it common enough?

If the 2nd coming of Adolf Hitler rose through Party X, and trafficked in lies &amp; getting ppl to believe Party Y is the end of their country (for the sake of Party X's power)..  ..wouldn't MSM call out lies, expose corruption, &amp; look like Party Y?

That ALL those ppl suddenly decided to go against their party/principles/family b/c they are disgruntled (many retired w/commendations) &amp; want fame (already have) &amp; sell books? OR, is it more likely all of those people are telling the truth about trump?
1323357854263316482 2020-11-03 04:14:33 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Culper_Lady56 @colleenjenk @ByTimReid @gabriellaborter @michaelvmartina Here's a hint:  There's a VERY LONG LINE of people of all stripes, from former business contacts &amp; gov't workers, to generals, to his own dang family that says he's a liar, only cares about himself, and is unfit for this job.    You seem to like proof... call that actual evidence

The entire MSM spontaneously &amp; radically changed into a partisan machine? OR A long-known liar/con-man/grifter/charlatan lies to  and everyone else?  [Make no mistake, his "successful businessman" persona has ALWAYS been a facade.]
1323356873236631558 2020-11-03 04:10:40 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Culper_Lady56 @colleenjenk @ByTimReid @gabriellaborter @michaelvmartina - MSM spent far too long trying *not* to call trump's statements "outright lies" until it became "enough is enough" - When 1 side traffics in lies for sake of power, truth merely looks partisan  I strongly suggest you ask yourself a critical question, and be honest with yourself:
1323356766525116416 2020-11-03 04:10:14 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Culper_Lady56 @colleenjenk @ByTimReid @gabriellaborter @michaelvmartina - trump has a LONG history of lying to the media to benefit himself (look it up)  - When a POTUS lies constantly, and his own party doesn't self-correct him, MSM must stand on the side of the truth.  Blatant lies cannot be treated like a legit "other side."
1323356662233735168 2020-11-03 04:09:49 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Culper_Lady56 @colleenjenk @ByTimReid @gabriellaborter @michaelvmartina - MSM in all its history has NEVER been overtly partisan ... granted! We agree! *air-hugs* - "now it is" is your opinion ... not fact - Now it only LOOKS TO YOU like it's partisan, b/c trump told you it was fake right away (it's not) -- reportedly exactly so he could discredit it
1323356585679310854 2020-11-03 04:09:31 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Culper_Lady56 @colleenjenk @ByTimReid @gabriellaborter @michaelvmartina Yes, opening minds would help, starting with your own.  By experience, this is usually a waste of time, but what the heck! I'll give this a try b/c you started with something we can agree on (which is rare now in itself) ...  Your "proof" is not proof b/c of a flaw in your logic:

Please have a look at my current pinned tweet thread?  I know it won't make any real difference -- it was a cathartic/busy effort to let me feel I'm contributing somehow -- but I do want to feel like someone saw it. thx!

1323152818266660864 2020-11-02 14:39:49 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> 3) Van Jones tried to express to whites (what POC already knew) the foreboding of trump's election  This is years before George Floyd's death drove it home for a lot more of us who just didn't get it (&amp; can't ever truly get it)  ..and days B4 some realized how vile trump truly is  https://t.co/owkt4NKe8U
1323152713149022209 2020-11-02 14:39:24 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> 2) TV trump supporters are CRAP judges of character.  How did THESE (in-video) forecasts pan out?  e.g.,  McEnany: he's "going to be a voice for all the people."  Lord: "he will make it his 1st objective to bring people together. I have not the slightest doubt about it."  https://t.co/bVY4cgTH0j

The only flawed logic I can see is that communism is further Left than Dem, so Cubans stay as far Right as possible to keep away from Leftists.  Except that one can go so far Right, it becomes like communism, just under a different name.

White vehicle being attacked was flagless. The "drivers-side flag" I cited was an illusion. Actually a tailgate flag from the vehicle in front.  Because: Facts matter. (to some of us)

I'd first thought those were Biden flags, an entourage behind the bus.  Now that I see it clearly, while the white car (w/ a drivers-side flag) straddled the white line, the dark pickup was not SS. Has a blue line flag. Not cool.

I believe this is a committed group of GOP staffers who have gone out of their way to: be moles; not get caught; help Muller; and inform to trusted sources in the FBI.

Do your part; get tested; get the flu vax.  Plus, given horrible circumstances, we're not doing awful. Here's the start of that thread.  https://t.co/6kiv8CjKCa

1319560897182969856 2020-10-23 16:46:48 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> I just spent some time -- too much -- watching a decent chunk of trump's 60 Minutes unedited video.  How he thinks makes my head hurt. Eyebrow now twitching. Energy sucked outta me.  But the problem is the # of ppl who think just like him. They will lap this up. Total victimhood.
1319547720319799296 2020-10-23 15:54:27 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> I was stunned when this was live ... it's just weirder seeing it again ...
1319545607653122049 2020-10-23 15:46:03 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @kylegriffin1 trumps lacks so little imagination, he is literally trying to exactly recreate 2016, where Comey announced an investigation into HRC right about now.  he thinks 2020 is, eh, close enough to 2016 that simply recreating conditions will be his ticket to winning.  he. so. STOOPID!
1319544128661749760 2020-10-23 15:40:10 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @BreeNewsome @debette_goldry You're not going to see less imagination than from a trump supporter.  They can't even figure out when trump has said -- with his own mouth; not through no fault/spin of any "fake news" -- contradictory things, false things, and inadvertently admitted his true character.
1319516225211420673 2020-10-23 13:49:18 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @cupidzclozet @PapaHoff1 Not this one.  But then, neither I nor anyone in my family ever worked in oil country.  And Biden could really, really use Pennsylvania.

Prob barely know who‚Äôs POTUS at a given moment. Cramming for the exam now.+those are only the ones who may bother to vote. They might have been reminded on YT or something.

I got as far as a repudiation/vindication of Joe by his own spokesperson. That, on its own, doesn‚Äôt amount to much.  Call me jaded after these past 4 years.

1319458925637472256 2020-10-23 10:01:36 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @19Dumptrump He really truly thinks he‚Äôs the best at everything (he‚Äôs often told so), so anything negative reported about him must be made up. He truly thinks what little he‚Äôs done is way more than anyone else and deserves praise he isn‚Äôt getting. At least he continuously tells himself that.

1319455070258421760 2020-10-23 09:46:17 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> There could have been some pluses to having a non-politician running things.  But that would have required said individual to be competent at SOMETHING! And to care ... about anyone else beyond his ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù  trump not only lacked pluses, but brought minuses.

1319359851412246529 2020-10-23 03:27:55 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Too true.  When the Right-wing tries too hard -- as they are doing consistently these days -- Cardillo is the result.  Don't be a John Cardillo.
1319357649343885312 2020-10-23 03:19:10 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Straight-up: The first time I read this, I thought it said "apologizes" instead of "agonizes" ...
1319172189518766081 2020-10-22 15:02:13 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump Hey, Murray -- I think you meant "less than $400K" here.
1319171995175702528 2020-10-22 15:01:27 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @23funshine @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump Surely, you don't understand how lying works, if you've believed anything trump's said for 4 years.  Also, I seriously doubt any "holistic therapist" makes enough to be getting any noticeable benefit from trump's tax breaks for the rich.
1319170803779457025 2020-10-22 14:56:43 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @SynnChronicle @murray_nyc @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I think you don't know how taxing works. This may help (not just you but all).  https://t.co/LisyobfbvU  Also, leave America &amp; go where? Most Richie Riches don't like POC across the world, and THIS is the place to enjoy all that $$. Every1 making Big Coin leaving is not plausible
1319165100708737026 2020-10-22 14:34:03 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> The sleeper big thing about the FBI PC on Wed: A) On its face, it hurts the targets: potential Biden voters &amp; Biden/Harris. B) Revealing a spoof, spoofers aim to "damage" the Proud Boys.  DNI Ratcliffe's assertion that this could damage trump is tacit ack that Proud Boys = trump
1319162163697770496 2020-10-22 14:22:23 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Looks VERY familiar ...

1318645394038050819 2020-10-21 04:08:55 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> ABSOLUTELY CORRECT!  One message I want everyone to get: given our Electoral College, this only comes down to the swing voters in the swing states.  If we could poll what they'd do, and they actually follow-through, we could have a clear sense.

He's sticking by impractical principles in that annoying way Bolton does. He's from that time.  BETTER: Make Spanky fire him and raise the hate against the dumbass-in-chief.
1318269558873034752 2020-10-20 03:15:29 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @jaketapper @jaketapper Just asked a guest "why? why? why?" would trump attack Fauci?  The answer is very, very simple. trump watched 60 Minutes last night. didn't like what Fauci said.  So now trump has to discredit him to continue his narrative (and not answer why he contradicts an expert)

1318023465681735680 2020-10-19 10:57:36 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> This is a good answer to a lot of things about trump...

1318015571838062592 2020-10-19 10:26:14 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> The choice is clear as day. Vote for Joe Biden. Pass it on.
1318015362546487296 2020-10-19 10:25:24 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Jules9800 Not me. And I pushed her with a barrage of thoughts (you know, since she doesn‚Äôt bother to think they for herself).  Though I was a bit late to the party.

She‚Äôs apparently in CA, which is a locked-in blue POTUS state.  So, Breaking News: a former entertainer‚Äôs vote doesn‚Äôt move any needles. That‚Äôs nice. Let‚Äôs move on, shall we?
1317666330741493761 2020-10-18 11:18:28 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @kirstiealley @realDonaldTrump I have to say, this is as embarrassing as the time our class had a mock vote and I voted for Ted Kennedy ... AFTER the Primaries were over.  This shows the same lack of attention to U.S. politics.
1317665176808787968 2020-10-18 11:13:53 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @kirstiealley @realDonaldTrump I get things done quickly! I‚Äôm also NOT a politician.  But the things I get done are not turning economies around - which trump has also never done - and the difference is: I know I have no business being POTUS so I stay out of the way of those who do.

1317662178997129216 2020-10-18 11:01:59 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @kirstiealley @realDonaldTrump So, I take it you‚Äôre impressed with how he used his Prez powers very early to boldly order multiple companies to make PPE in a coordinated manner before the virus spread out of control. *whew* We dodged a bullet there, eh?
1317661450668834816 2020-10-18 10:59:05 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @kirstiealley @realDonaldTrump So, I take it grabbing you by the pussy us not a deal-breaker?

1317336024918392834 2020-10-17 13:25:57 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> So, what a 6yo might do w/a massive disappointment is what you're going to see right after he officially loses. This is my main worry rn.  He(+Barr) are gonna order gov't lawyers to fight the shit out of any/all perceived/dug-up/created-of-thin-air unfairness. This gonna be fugly
1317336022829641728 2020-10-17 13:25:57 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> If that's so, he still thinking like a 6yr old ... still inexcusable for a 70+ man.  Sure he hopes supporters will fight (w/guns) for him. But the core for him is still "it's unfair." In fair game, he thinks he wins 100%.
1317336020879347712 2020-10-17 13:25:56 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> "I only lose if it's rigged" = this 'unfairness' to him (only that) will cause some voters to turn against him &amp; ballots to be counted unfairly.  It's simple math for him: they liked me last time + I haven't changed + I did shit + I'm running the same campaign as 2016 = I win
1317336018232762368 2020-10-17 13:25:56 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Most Generous Possible Take on trump: he actually believes he's awesome, misunderstood by his lessers (~everyone), and treated unfairly by anyone who sees things differently  NOTE: he expects hate/anything goes from his enemies; same as he to them ... that's the game for him

Similar to time limits on ‚Äúacting‚Äù gov‚Äôt positions, we see there needs to be time limits on how long seats can be left unfilled.

But, for some reason, they weren't my thing. I could never figure out what to do with so many pieces. I could never visualize something and create it, and randomly joining them was boring. ADHD?

Heard local conservative radio guy today praising Joe Biden‚Äôs leadership in praying for POTUS w/o an IToldYouSo or Karma &amp; encouraging masks.  He unknowingly admitted that trump doesn‚Äôt show leadership, b/c we all know trump never woulda said either (&amp; meant it).
1312174679264694272 2020-10-03 07:36:37 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @nytimes Technically, he said FLOTUS *is* doing very well and he *thinks* he is doing very well.  He didn‚Äôt address himself and his wife as being in the same condition.  Little bit of a tell there.

But clearly dropboxes being open this week means officials expected these to be in our hands well before now.  Makes me wonder re: specific parameters elsewhere &amp; whether anyone received a ballot they can now only trust USPS to deliver on time.

Closer look: Seems RealB (whom I followed &amp; quite respect BTW) saw fit to block me, presumably over my comment here? No idea. If anyone wants to fill me in on her comment up there, I'm open  https://t.co/KD92dsHOfJ

We all know they have to guess at the right mix each year, then wait to see what comes around. Some years it's a complete miss.

Probably no new bots on you to purge.  They did do a new security check on me today.  Probably others failed it (bots or not).

1308825766495506440 2020-09-24 01:49:14 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Rand Paul has always been a worthless blowhard who caves to the GOP‚Äôs most radical agenda. Pass it on.
1308821414728925185 2020-09-24 01:31:56 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Marina_Sirtis @SusanSarandon That entirely depends on what state @SusanSarandon voted in. If it was CA (an assumption,I know), then her 3rd party vote did not help Dolt45, b/c all CA electoral votes went to HRC anyway.  But if she's in, or influenced others in, swing states to do same, the anger is justified
1308820866554306561 2020-09-24 01:29:45 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Homeoffree61 No. But might consider it late in season. 2 reasons:  1) We are so quarantined from COVID, we have way more chance of catching aerisolized COVID than flu.  2) Effectiveness. Whatever the # each year, it's not "very high" so it's a gamble for an injection. If good this year: maybe
1308819049317625856 2020-09-24 01:22:32 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Homeoffree61 Honestly, so do I.  But mine is just tremors.  Also, I think that's why trump drinks water with 2 hands.

Just found a video that matched his already-Fox-Entertained views and trolled on about it.

That was carefully cut from a speech stating he doesn‚Äôt pledge allegiance to trump‚Äôs idols or Dem party,whatever, but rather makes allusions to parts of The Pledge ... to be POTUS for all.

That's all they need.

When you first shared that, I believe I said that I didn't know you but I don't have to.  That still holds.  We share this planet, you are in pain, and I share some of it with you. Keep hanging in there.
1307115635634311168 2020-09-19 08:33:47 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @RoguePOTUSStaff Only because trump inflamed literally everyone who's been paying any attention for the last 4 years, raising the stakes of this election over perhaps any other in U.S. history.  That and the fact that we can't have confidence in a Sen. Leader to not be a hypocrite.
1307114415288913921 2020-09-19 08:28:56 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Liz_Wheeler Spoken like a true partisan.  I can see you playing a board game with the family.  "No, no, that rule does not apply when _I_ am holding the dice, only when you are."  Because, even a 5 year old knows how fair that is ... and you clearly would fist pump in his face and not GAF.
1307113671315853315 2020-09-19 08:25:58 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @DevinCow @SenatorRomney Quite right.  Call upon the ones who at least have a decent chance to make a difference here.  It is so sad and unfortunate that Americans keep voting in people who have no base integrity, only partisanship.

I remember you had to say good-bye to your daughter recently (right?).  I hope my memory about you is correct here ... I'm a bit emotional right now.
1307111464457719811 2020-09-19 08:17:12 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @DWUhlfelderLaw and please DO NOT threaten any bodily harm to anyone in the process ...  Let's not do anything stupid in an emotional moment here.

1306869317259145217 2020-09-18 16:15:00 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @CNNPolitics Case in point, anyone could cut the video of this tweet to make it seem like Biden said, ‚ÄúIt really, really offended me, when he volunteered to go there‚Äù making Biden sound anti-troops ...

Watch everything around that claim.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äù was something like ‚Äúthat COVID19 is a crisis‚Äù or ‚Äúsaying my handling of it is bad‚Äù ... but in that speech he acknowledges it exists.  I mean still #TrumpIsALoser

1306862149025828864 2020-09-18 15:46:31 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @EricaResists45 @CNNPolitics Now, his base then did run off and take away the same thing .. that the virus itself is a hoax.  But since when does trump correct any of the ‚Äúfine people‚Äù in his base?
1306861301315047427 2020-09-18 15:43:09 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @EricaResists45 @CNNPolitics Notice that nearly every video of that speech cuts off at ‚Äúhoax.‚Äù  That doesn‚Äôt provide a complete context. Sorry, just facts.  But none of this changes that #TrumpIsALoser

1305944780233412609 2020-09-16 03:01:13 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Truth. In context, anyone would use this in place of ‚ÄúWhere am I going to be tomorrow?‚Äù  Meanwhile, trump slurs saying the United Shtates and that‚Äôs good?
1305942373961207808 2020-09-16 02:51:39 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @chrislhayes And .... this happened??

This is the best &amp; brightest that his personality can attract.  Anyone with a high IQ and/or self-esteem is working for someone, anyone, much better.

Thinking he can actually out-Putin Putin?  I mean, it‚Äôs all certifiably stupid.  Imagine if we got stuck with a pathologically evil smart guy.
1305769398020513793 2020-09-15 15:24:19 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Jeff424V @SiegelAtty He did the same thing with Venezuela. Said a few of the right words ‚Äî that don‚Äôt actually matter to him ‚Äî in support of ‚Äúthe other guy.‚Äù  Same with recognizing Jerusalem.  It‚Äôs all based on Big Data for votes.  What happens if he wins and then doesn‚Äôt have to care about votes?

Our super-friendly neighbor also hates our weak, pathetic, Made in the 9th level of Hell figurehead.  The more, the merrier?  Actually we just get to jealously enjoy witnessing the freedom of someone who feels as we do, but doesn‚Äôt have to live with him.
1305761293916397569 2020-09-15 14:52:06 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @jilevin Wasn‚Äôt Newsweek (which was equal with Time, once upon) spewing other pro-Trump propaganda recently?  I thought their credibility was already zero.
1305760320548409344 2020-09-15 14:48:14 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> THIS! THIS is the actual question.  And I think the answer is: these are the people who prefer that over the fear of socialism.
1305759373629812736 2020-09-15 14:44:29 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @PrncplExtrovert @DrumLifeUSA Excellent point.  Senate is our failsafe in any case.  Even if he wins, if both houses on Congress are blue, he loses.

That HE‚Äôs fine at all these rallies b/c podium &amp; distance. And he looked uncomfortable about how close the reporter was.  Everyone else be damned. And, ironically, the damned say the exact same things in interviews: I‚ÄôM fine!
1305683355133005825 2020-09-15 09:42:24 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @divamac @BayesianLeif @RoguePOTUSStaff But also, yeah, probably less about education itself. I imagine every prep school bully who grows up smart/knowledge enough to, say, manage successful financial portfolios is still a trump Republican.
1305682505782177793 2020-09-15 09:39:02 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @divamac @BayesianLeif @RoguePOTUSStaff I came to the theory long ago that USA liberals &amp; conservatives are most fundamentally different in their answer to:  ‚ÄúAm I my brother‚Äôs keeper?‚Äù and how broadly they define ‚Äúbrother.‚Äù  So, I‚Äôd say both tweets above are correct; the empathy at the core of the parties.
1305428358361231361 2020-09-14 16:49:08 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @BillMcJesus @NatSecMulligan You spelled "preventable causes" wrong.
1305428007310561280 2020-09-14 16:47:45 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @BillMcJesus @NatSecMulligan Herd Immunity is most likely reachable the same way it is reached for several other diseases.  Vaccine.  And a safe &amp; reliable one is likely in 2021.  Doesn't sound like 10 years to me, "genius."
1305427579663507456 2020-09-14 16:46:03 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @BillMcJesus @NatSecMulligan And how many of the 5,846 deaths were preventable?  If, say, they had shut down, slowed the spread, did all the things the U.S. experts now recommend?  Your smoke screen doesn't change the fact that those who lived through your graphic came out the other end saying: Don't Copy Us
1305291461215358976 2020-09-14 07:45:10 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @pgroshon @RoguePOTUSStaff You mean, like Benghazi? And like "Barry" - and now Biden - both wanting Communist revolution? (which didn't happen then &amp; won't now)  These aren't actual fears except for the dumbest &amp; most gullible among us -- and the numbers of those is astounding. To others these are tactics.
1305288250454663168 2020-09-14 07:32:24 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @BillMcJesus @NatSecMulligan Or, better stated ...  https://t.co/YIjU79rfDI
1305286836919640064 2020-09-14 07:26:47 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @BillMcJesus @NatSecMulligan So, no. "the only way to move on" was already stated here ... perhaps you missed it: "Well-worn masks. BUT certain ppl just won't do it, so oh well!"  https://t.co/h7pZIRfnH5
1305286238019162117 2020-09-14 07:24:24 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @BillMcJesus @NatSecMulligan If you want to know the true effects of natural herd immunity with COVID, look at Sweden.  You know, the ppl who say: "Don't do what we did!"  We're not managing an ant colony where we can lose 200K+ and just say, "it is what it is" ... these are PREVENTABLE ppl's lives, &amp; deaths

Just as much as trump‚Äôs tenure has cemented his place in my mind as a weak, selfish, strictly self-serving, callous, pompous, vindictive, psychotic, lying LOSER!

But on the good side, when I didn't show for Father's Day, we talked and he went with, "nobody knows what to believe anymore" (COVID)  I know he thinks he's right and that was disingenuous, but he tried.

It's unhealthy to believe there must be someone to blame for every wrong. Unhealthy to be told repeatedly the source of all that ailes are ppl who want Marxism, want disorder/riots, want pedophiles, etc.

The medium that makes it possible; that's the game-changer.  For all the good we thought it could do at the start, and that it does in fact, some have become expert in taking advantage of it ... and before a saturation of tech savvy

Most likely due to lack of testing available everywhere to prove whether the deceased had it; no proof = not listed as COVID.

Bot programmers are aiming at the 50/50 mark more. they're getting better/more dangerous.  Also, 2nd account tonight with lots of nums saying this stuff w/ last name "Reagan" #BlockTheBots  https://t.co/f0AtwE05cx

Seen this same defense used by accounts that rate worse as bots.  Most likely, this is one as well. Either way, this info is crap. #BlockTheBots  https://t.co/5GyjqwYsO7

Smart enough never to get caught or do/say any incriminating things? Could ACTUALLY manipulate Putin, Un, Canada, GB, etc.? And with this GOP?  We‚Äôd have been SO (much more) screwed!

Thinks he needs the same Peace Prize his ‚Äúlesser‚Äù got.  Jus‚Äô sayin‚Äô ‚Äî this is miles beyond ‚Äúpetty.‚Äù (see Cohen‚Äôs book)

1303949031232675845 2020-09-10 14:50:49 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @IonaLeepoetry The Exorcist. Around 8-10? Watched some on the console TV from a hiding place after bedtime. Escaped back to bed to not sleep much.  Also, later (11?), Raiders of the Lost Ark. Couldn‚Äôt deal with melting &amp; exploding heads ... for days.

Showing your true emotions is your core strength.  And I‚Äôm so very sorry for your loss.

1303813577166389248 2020-09-10 05:52:35 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @pantherdraws @JasonToe "publishing" is way too generous here.  John Barron was one of his favorite names to use to pretend to be someone else, say, an "everyman" on radio shows to laud donald trump, or to get his way with others.  So, whenever he says "people say" ... he's talking about John Barron.

1302841288748916740 2020-09-07 13:29:03 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @RealBitchIsBack @birchmorecraig @lisagatzby Found it (yes, that's all it says, folks). Well played, Jack.  Always liked him.  https://t.co/qwtm1xuatX
1302832079600836608 2020-09-07 12:52:27 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Hate Sunday nights. Cable news only has pre-taped "specialty" shows. Need my nightly "what's happening right now in trump's America" fix.  WTF is going on out there? Under these circumstances, I hate not knowing.  What's live? Where I can I find it?
1302829982960570368 2020-09-07 12:44:08 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @murphydan617 Thanks!  Ima gonna check that out.
1302828756130836486 2020-09-07 12:39:15 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Homeoffree61 You didn't ask, but lemme take a stab at what's going thru their minds, as a male (but not to justify)  "Pretty woman look sad. She like me if I make happy. Plus she look prettier = me feel stuff. I know! She need me tell her what to do: Smile! There,that make her hap... uh-oh!"
1302825405922127872 2020-09-07 12:25:56 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @ashleyroybal @Bigtommystyle You may be surprised what you find on Twitter if you go looking.  ... or if certain racy tweets sometimes just show up for you b/c the system must have figured out you are male.
1302824714705006592 2020-09-07 12:23:11 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @ashleyroybal @Bigtommystyle My take is he called you a modern version of "tease."  As such, I hope you are secure in the knowledge that he has all the issues here, not you.  He doesn't have to take any rent-free space in your life starting now.
1302823946656636930 2020-09-07 12:20:08 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @ashleyroybal @Bigtommystyle Think I'm getting this better now. Not knowing all that preceded, guessing this is related to your recent divorce + your bikini pic. Dude thinks he can pick you up on Twitter. You prob well know, when females don't "satisfy" such advances, a-holes like that will call names.
1302820789692116992 2020-09-07 12:07:36 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @ashleyroybal @Bigtommystyle But now we‚Äôre clear the dude didn‚Äôt mistype ‚Äúsexpot‚Äù (inconceivable!) and intentionally called you whatever he meant by that.
1302820166791843840 2020-09-07 12:05:07 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @ashleyroybal @Bigtommystyle That it does, Ash. ... That it does.
1302819804030603266 2020-09-07 12:03:41 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @PrncplExtrovert It‚Äôll be better tomorrow. :)
1302819576355393536 2020-09-07 12:02:46 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @ashleyroybal @Bigtommystyle But since you‚Äôre young, I hadn‚Äôt considered maybe you don‚Äôt know the 60s-70s term ‚Äúsexpot‚Äù
1302817608949997568 2020-09-07 11:54:57 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @ashleyroybal @Bigtommystyle I‚Äôm talking about what that dude called you, of course.
1302817328405635073 2020-09-07 11:53:50 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @ashleyroybal Good thing you can‚Äôt say that in 100% emojis.
1302817147488436224 2020-09-07 11:53:07 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @ashleyroybal If I had only known I was before now!
1302816897465974788 2020-09-07 11:52:08 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @PrncplExtrovert I hear ya. So sorry.  So then you‚Äôve done 19/20. Clear. Good job!!

1302815695168851968 2020-09-07 11:47:21 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @ashleyroybal @Bigtommystyle I was gonna call ‚Äútypo?‚Äù but the B is nowhere near the P.

1302812810976600064 2020-09-07 11:35:53 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @PrncplExtrovert Thanks for the chuckle, Misadventure. Awesome.  But you should either have a 16 or a 4. Unless you aren‚Äôt counting ‚Äúsort of‚Äùs?
1302812021029851136 2020-09-07 11:32:45 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @mistergeezy 15.  And, no, I didn‚Äôt read it wrong. Haven‚Äôt done.

1302811694247350273 2020-09-07 11:31:27 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @RightIsRay @mistergeezy I think you read it wrong.  HAVEN‚ÄôT done.
1302810827037306881 2020-09-07 11:28:00 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Jayemcee2 @EscapeGoat2020 @Amy_Siskind After I get past even having text#s for registered voters, I have seen that some Latino FL voters are pro-trump b/c they are (apparently) shallow, 1-issue voters, e.g., VZ expats feel trump did SOMEthing against Meduro (vs. Obama), etc.
1302807270061936640 2020-09-07 11:13:52 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Siobhan99 @Amy_Siskind @votefwd And put it in trump‚Äôs now-controlled USPS. This is beyond crazy. Aren‚Äôt there checks &amp; balances for this?
1302806728107593728 2020-09-07 11:11:43 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @MeliBarrientes @cclamshelli @Amy_Siskind Sounds like you‚Äôre describing Mitch McConnell. Seriously.  Sorry, I can‚Äôt hear you over all those WH admins and former trump confidants testifying consistently to his lies.  Dems are fine. Traditional GOP are even fine. But anyone still aligned with trump has broken with reality.
1302805028458070016 2020-09-07 11:04:58 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Jayemcee2 @EscapeGoat2020 @Amy_Siskind Dems in FL specifically? Do they say why?
1302803637840818177 2020-09-07 10:59:26 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Been repeating that for years now.
1302802758358249472 2020-09-07 10:55:57 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @realDonaldTrump Such projection.  trump colluding w/ Putin for money &amp; elections, suppressing COVID #s b/c they look bad, disparaging military he never served in, spiking USPS, etc. is all WAY more believable than Dems+MSM+Tech getting away with a coordinated dissa campaign.  You. Imperil. Us.
1302800206916919301 2020-09-07 10:45:48 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @RealHeatherK That‚Äôs cool ... and sad at the same time.

1302797591097290752 2020-09-07 10:35:25 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @RealBitchIsBack I‚Äôm a Mid-Atlantic guy. Had a friend grow up here, move to CA, then later report that it was ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù there .. it was 55F.  Where we come from, water freezes at 32F. (and does so fairly often here)
1302796851490574339 2020-09-07 10:32:28 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @CherylAbernath1 True that. Family who won‚Äôt message you on your birthday represents a major problem with their ability to put family before righteousness (much like country before party).  https://t.co/RGjCkpAnGr

1302782075821592579 2020-09-07 09:33:46 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Just found out ... this one could never get enough retweets
1302781187224633349 2020-09-07 09:30:14 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @chipfranklin Just, no.  His blind support of trump sours all of his work.  He can no longer be seen as a reasonable person.

Which I now think led to it not being aired often in the 70s/80s. I‚Äôd blame the Execs for that.

1302746398811660296 2020-09-07 07:11:59 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Homeoffree61 Yes
1302746289252302850 2020-09-07 07:11:33 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @MaryPrier1 @lisagatzby My kids like the terrible live action movie they made years back. It‚Äôs the only reason they know who these 2 are, so I‚Äôm thankful for it.
1302745909814493186 2020-09-07 07:10:03 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @lisagatzby I liked this one for a time, too. Had the toys, which were pretty cool toys, BTW.  This is the only GIF I could find .. was called M.A.S.K.  which is not easy to type on a mobile device, BTW.)  https://t.co/KDwdIx8jYT

1302743941561942019 2020-09-07 07:02:14 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @simplyatomic @lisagatzby Amazingly, the same org did a dog + human show on Nick, I think. Not too long ago. Couldn‚Äôt believe it when I saw the credits.
1302743074599309312 2020-09-07 06:58:47 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @LadyOni70 @RivasSergio @lisagatzby After my own heart. Thought I might be the only one to post this answer.  I got Season 1 DVD long ago; didn‚Äôt expect to steam back then. Had to reconcile the real show vs. 7Zark7.  But this led directly (later) into a similar love of Robotech.

Mo Willems‚Äô ‚ÄúElephant &amp; Piggy‚Äù books. There‚Äôs a costume party w/ a duck wearing racing goggles &amp; helmet ... with a number ‚Äú5‚Äù on the side.

A very well-known online retailer, who makes a big deal re:how virus-safe they are in TV ads, is actually only as safe as the local supervisors who may/may not bother to enforce masks. Which is mostly not.  So,I‚Äôm fine having limited access to people
1302512888691687424 2020-09-06 15:44:06 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @ReallyAmerican1 Trump doesn‚Äôt effin care. (only as far as it could affect his re-election)
1302510238499844096 2020-09-06 15:33:34 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @mmpadellan In the end, it turns out that all this time we‚Äôve been calling him President Bone Spurs (and the like) as an insult, he‚Äôs been regarding that as a badge of honor. Think about that for a minute. #TrumpHatesOurVeterans  Of course he is. What else did we expect? Wow.
1302433511358500865 2020-09-06 10:28:41 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> So true ...

1301674296285167618 2020-09-04 08:11:50 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @spookyboibtw @nowthisnews Your turn: Take the dubious timing of the following, IN TOTAL  * COVID-19 * POTUS election year * mail-in voting desired * new, non-USPS Postmaster General * scrapping of machines &amp; mailboxes * bald-faced lies re:"dangers" of mail-in voting  POTUS-caused fraud doesn't bother you?
1301671847700832257 2020-09-04 08:02:07 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @spookyboibtw @nowthisnews This video is 1 small (amusing, a rarity) piece of a very large puzzle. The piece itself isn't deep  If all you can see (or write here) is the (subjective) good you can identify trump has done,you will never see (or acknowledge) how this 1 small piece fits into the entire picture
1301671086447235072 2020-09-04 07:59:05 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @spookyboibtw @nowthisnews Then you either have an agenda here or are willfully ignorant, donning rose-colored glasses on purpose.  Others look at the whole picture, the entire man, everything he has done &amp; said vs. known facts.  Signing off on some (not his) $$ does not make up for all the lying.

1301669072073940993 2020-09-04 07:51:05 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> Watching a segment on the way COVID-19 disproportionally affects POC and realizing:  trump knows some of his base will die from the virus, but he's also likely playing a numbers game, hoping this exact disproportionality will take more POC voters than his base voters.  It tracks.

With an honest eye, evolutionarily-speaking, humans weren‚Äôt ideally built for that social construct. It‚Äôs do-able, but not natural.  I‚Äôm also with the guy who said: no 1 wants me, so it‚Äôs easy

Not looking at it deeply enough.  This is just yet another consistent aspect of this man that paints a picture of who he really is. As does every tell-all writing, taken together.
1301607645481111553 2020-09-04 03:47:00 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @spookyboibtw @nowthisnews Policies are not enough. The man &amp; intent must be judged. The few times he has enacted,the right way,policies most could agree are good,he still comes off as some1 who doesn't care,just wants these things to get reelected.  So what happens when "reelection" is no longer his goal?
1301594822290018304 2020-09-04 02:56:02 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @spookyboibtw @nowthisnews That many times?  Some of them he hired himself.  No, bruh.  Nice try.

What do you believe is more likely?  1)AntiFa/BLM, both anti-trump, taking actions that help trump politically? 2)trump allies taking actions that help trump politically? 3)random unaffiliated acts  Me: 2
1301196451368718336 2020-09-03 00:33:03 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Darji @thedailybeast Also this:  https://t.co/t5E1Xe5VSV
1301196420192415745 2020-09-03 00:32:56 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Darji @thedailybeast Evidence that "far left extremists" caused that? Sham.  Much more likely: callous rioters taking advantage of protesting. Not even a looting gain there. Since this action only hurts the Dems (+ these innocents), more likely like that RW guy on taped starting a previous riot fire.

"What's going on right now" are legit protesters, few locales, protesting cop brutality that HAS TO STOP somehow.  +a POTUS with a Nixon approach who ONLY wants to "win."  "Safe and Stay at home" -- Always‚òÆÔ∏è

If you understand English &amp; follow a thread (+follow ACCURATE news), obviously trump.  + still don't get what BLM is.  More likely: You are racists yourself &amp; only have an agenda here. #skinhead
1301189391407181824 2020-09-03 00:05:00 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Darji @thedailybeast You're clearly confused &amp; misinformed here.  BLM isn't the problem. AntiFa barely exists.  + In your construct, if ppl condemn these THEN trump will win (not either/or). You meant: either ppl condemn trump OR not(trump wins).  But it's only really about a few 100 in swing states.

Common man me would be out there peaceful w/BLM if I could.
1301185786256138243 2020-09-02 23:50:40 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> @Darji @thedailybeast Bottom Line:  BLM are protesting, not rioting. Rioters/looters are taking advantage; some are verifiably RW/trump supporters. +See pic for how MLK was portrayed in the 60s.  Antifa is a tiny group that barely exists. Simply what trump wants ppl to believe are behind everything.  https://t.co/cf0EXQcCMn

That is what makes these men the same. Intent.  Intelligence, internal structure, chance of success are irrelevant points.  You said he should have used tanks against protesters. Says a lot about you.

It's easier for Erdogan b/c of the existing situation.  These men have similar goals; trump sees them as mentors.  Inability to use military has more to do with existing structure, and that our boys hopefully wouldn't follow an illegal order

That's his aim, whatever you call it. And for him to be a nationalist, he's have to 1st care about the country itself ... and he does not. Not 1 bit. 2/2

1301012449827729409 2020-09-02 12:21:54 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> WANTED: A recent "truth about trump" tweet -- preferably an "in-his-own-words" tweet -- to bring my Pinned Tweet up-to-date.  I mean, I love what I've got, but POTUS has done SO MUCH MORE since then.  Whatcha got, Twitter?
1301011018253062145 2020-09-02 12:16:13 +0800 <ABtaughtme2cook> This one deserves a boost. Fascinating reading.  Also shows how the "poorly educated" can continue to think this way. These defenses require no actual facts, knowledge, and only enough intelligence to be creative.
