1320669449477828608 2020-10-26 18:11:48 +0800 <trcq2u> @JoyAnnReid This is a baby "man" that runs away from anything that has any effort required. He makes mistakes and screws things up then runs. A conman put in charge that has failed at so many things then files for bankruptcy to run away from responsibilities.

I was appalled that a conman was put in office, an incompetent one who ran businesses into ground and filed bankruptcy to run away from responsibilities. WTF did people think he was going to do differently 4 US

I updated my voter registration for the 2016 election because the republican party chose an incompetent oaf to run as their candidate. I remember learning the electoral college was in control of who won and the citizens votes didn't matter, ...
