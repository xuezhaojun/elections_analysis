How much did it cost us again for his little jaunt outside and to bad for his secret service stuck in the car with him. Maybe one last look around at his supporters....the ones that are left anyway.

1304383066971017218 2020-09-11 19:35:32 +0800 <Lisa64320548> @GasperChimes @realDonaldTrump I agree. It didnt help when his press secretary defended him by saying his rallies are peaceful demonstrations so there are 1st amendment rights not wearing a mask....good message to send out..idiots..WEAR YOUR DAMN MASK SO WE CAN GET ON WITH OUR LIVES ONE DAY!!!!!!!
