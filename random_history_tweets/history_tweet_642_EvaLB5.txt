1341712842777620485 2020-12-23 19:50:44 +0800 <EvaLB5> A LAW should be passed limiting size &amp; scope of Bills. They should stay with subject at hand, and not "throw in" zillion of other bs items.

1338465679348031491 2020-12-14 20:47:40 +0800 <EvaLB5> As an Ordained Minister in mainline Protestant Religion, and a Theology Doctorate, I use my "titles" in written &amp; professional venues. Not one of my friends etc.. call me Doctor. I am proud of my accomplishments, and in no way degrade myself or others, but let's keep it real!
1338465248915951616 2020-12-14 20:45:57 +0800 <EvaLB5> Right off the bat, I detested Jill because of her elitist, pompous attitude &amp; insistence of being called Dr.  She's completely wrong as her degree is Ed.D, and only used in writings &amp; professional compacity; period. Every day life, she is Mrs. Joe "Relic" Biden
1338464796082139138 2020-12-14 20:44:09 +0800 <EvaLB5> Titles earned in higher education are only used in professional or written settings (minus M.D. &amp; a few others).  Every day use of "titles" is unnecessary. The only people I regularly call Doctor are my medical personnel.

1338452403776069634 2020-12-14 19:54:54 +0800 <EvaLB5> @WatchChad PERIOD.
1338448406604296192 2020-12-14 19:39:01 +0800 <EvaLB5> We've been saying it for years that all this chaos, division and other nefarious activity had started &amp; continues by BHO's &amp; gang.  There's zero doubt about it. And here he is popping up to prepare for his 3rd term; disgusting!
1338447942869524480 2020-12-14 19:37:11 +0800 <EvaLB5> I thought today's  Electoral College votes wear NOT released until later date 🤔
1338447306815909889 2020-12-14 19:34:39 +0800 <EvaLB5> Crazy world making a big deal of a relic liar "addressing the Nation". That's utter bs and he is NOT President-elect nor anything else except FORMER VP. It's beyond insulting and outrageous; but, that's propaganda media!
1338444191177773061 2020-12-14 19:22:16 +0800 <EvaLB5> @TrnNews007 I've been calling her the reincarnated "Ma Barker"
1338441752441655298 2020-12-14 19:12:35 +0800 <EvaLB5> @Raiklin Mine too.
1338302196568494088 2020-12-14 09:58:02 +0800 <EvaLB5> Untill tomorrow God willing 🙏
1338286453848150016 2020-12-14 08:55:29 +0800 <EvaLB5> I'll just say I've detested Jill since her attitude when 2d lady; and Ma Barker needs not be reincarnated!

1338124385970864138 2020-12-13 22:11:29 +0800 <EvaLB5> I'm tired of constantly hearing @GOPLeader on TV, but we've seen zero action fighting back against Pelosi's craziness. IMHO, he'll be weak as Speaker

1338095348905021440 2020-12-13 20:16:06 +0800 <EvaLB5> Not sure when they'll realize the level of hatred displayed is unhealthy and certainly, not normal. Obsession, hysteria and delusion comes to mind...
1338082531242106880 2020-12-13 19:25:10 +0800 <EvaLB5> Most of the time, you can tell who has read a "profile bio" and who has not. Many times, it makes a difference in understanding IMHO

1338077680126865408 2020-12-13 19:05:53 +0800 <EvaLB5> @UMightGetMauled hummmm I don't read it as "a mind is terrible", but rather not using your mind is a terrible waste 🤔 Also, if I remember, it was a slogan to "combat" drugs; which we all know makes your mind mush  Interesting perspective, thank you.

1337360550653726720 2020-12-11 19:36:16 +0800 <EvaLB5> Anyone who believes Creepy Joe is clean and "innocent" of all this is sadly mistaken and naïve; that includes obnoxious jill.
1337360186676277248 2020-12-11 19:34:50 +0800 <EvaLB5> Nancy sure has a lot of "power" for someone so squeaky clean 🤦
1337359867397468160 2020-12-11 19:33:33 +0800 <EvaLB5> @francklyspoken @Sabrina67408695 @tbaker1968 @JonDStrange1 @RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump It's entitlement thinking, just as trophies for everyone. I study &amp; work hard and get A's; someone next to me does nothing and gets F's. But, somehow the studious ones are at fault, and must accept "sharing" your grade with the "lazy"; hence, all get A's and are applauded 🙄
1337358999856041995 2020-12-11 19:30:07 +0800 <EvaLB5> And, here we are 🐏
1337358720028831746 2020-12-11 19:29:00 +0800 <EvaLB5> And we spend millions, if not billions, trying to develop vaccines and/or medicines for major diseases; why?  If each year we can receive a shot for current strain of flu, then why aren't medical researchers ready for diseases?  Of course, I'm not a medical doctor, but it's odd
1337358040744550403 2020-12-11 19:26:18 +0800 <EvaLB5> Medicine sure is mind-boggling, isn't it 😑
1337357908137349120 2020-12-11 19:25:46 +0800 <EvaLB5> If the creators of this virus strain knew &amp; understood it's implications, then it would appear the cure was out there as the virus was released? It was clear a vaccine was manufactured in advance, or quickly thereafter. Same country, same people, and same "victims" of the sell
1337357502309130243 2020-12-11 19:24:10 +0800 <EvaLB5> We're celebrating a vaccine for China Virus manufactured within months. Yet, we marvel how quickly it's being distributed?
1337357038477864960 2020-12-11 19:22:19 +0800 <EvaLB5> Therefore, it appears science can move quickly if it so desires. Current, yearly flu shots are usually available by SEP of each year. How do they know which strain, how can it be developed so quickly?
1337356730796285952 2020-12-11 19:21:06 +0800 <EvaLB5> Always fascinated me that it's well known Seasonal Flu is a different strain each year; yet, there is ALWAYS a FLU SHOT available to combat current strain 🤔 Question is when do they know the year's strain, and when do they start developing current flu vaccine? HOW?

They seemed very afraid, especially the Dems citing the SecofState constantly. Denial &amp; dismissive they were despite knowing full well they were on camera.  We'll keep 🙏🙏

1334667539792752641 2020-12-04 09:15:13 +0800 <EvaLB5> After today, I sincerely believe Jan 5th run off will be a sham as well. The @GASenateGOP allowed the fraud to continue &amp; their Sen Judiciary Cmte dismissed the proof and Constitutional Duties of the Legislators. A sad day for Georgia voters.
1334666957774319616 2020-12-04 09:12:54 +0800 <EvaLB5> Was very troubling and we feel for the voters in Georgia after listening to the Senate Judiciary Cmte @GASenateGOP  Sad how low GA has fallen.
1334666163461246976 2020-12-04 09:09:44 +0800 <EvaLB5> I was surprised to read that tweet even before anything was shown. Her hostility revealed a lot. I cc'd The Mayor, but glad Jenna felt similar.  The GA Senate Judiciary Cmte was very troubling to hear today. Sad for Georgia
1334651773512978432 2020-12-04 08:12:34 +0800 <EvaLB5> WOW Unhinged and/or triggered  She entered with dismissive attitude
1334647231237017600 2020-12-04 07:54:31 +0800 <EvaLB5> Georgia State Senator thoughts. This morning @RudyGiuliani was accused of conspiracy (as below) &amp; spreading "garbage" (by a different Senator). So much evidence presented &amp; it's been dismissed before it's begun 👀 That's the "sad sham" #Georgia #ElectionIntegrity
1334642459880656896 2020-12-04 07:35:33 +0800 <EvaLB5> Minus a few, these Legislators won't do anything. Glad Trump layer will prepare Court papers tonight

1334632371472257024 2020-12-04 06:55:28 +0800 <EvaLB5> They've given SecofState power over them  WOW  Sorry Georgia

1334631544804298752 2020-12-04 06:52:11 +0800 <EvaLB5> Legislators seem afraid of Georgia SecofState  Now, that's scary folks!
1334631317628211200 2020-12-04 06:51:17 +0800 <EvaLB5> She doesn't want to do her duty, but wants Courts to decide. She didn't see evidence. It was shown all day!  She's not tracking at all!  She's going by AG Barr statement &amp; what SecofState says.  WOW

1334509276115705860 2020-12-03 22:46:20 +0800 <EvaLB5> It's ending at 1230 in Georgia for another hearing at 1. General Counsel for SecofState speaking now.  I don't expect anything will change by the tone of this Senate hearing in Georgia 😳
1334508674295934979 2020-12-03 22:43:56 +0800 <EvaLB5> It's obvious watching these States, we need uniform Federal Election laws followed by all States/Commonwealths in USA. Not this &amp; that &amp; more as we're witnessing 🤬

1334339233956450304 2020-12-03 11:30:38 +0800 <EvaLB5> Censure her @MI_Republicans  It's been appalling
1334338612842926082 2020-12-03 11:28:10 +0800 <EvaLB5> How embarrassing and disheartening watching the @MI_Republicans &amp; Dems on House Oversight Cmte not know Election laws &amp; procedures or Constitutional Duties. Many Michiganders are not happy we've been dismissed &amp; cheated: openly by our Elected Officials 🤬 So sad.
1334336993518641155 2020-12-03 11:21:44 +0800 <EvaLB5> NO  MI House Oversight committee -  you need a forensic audit , not hand re- counts @MI_Republicans @MISenate  It's your Legislative Branch duty to do something!

1334327540861825024 2020-12-03 10:44:11 +0800 <EvaLB5> Why do majority of Dems attack, badger, and intimidate people who don't agree with them 👀

1334324633877815298 2020-12-03 10:32:37 +0800 <EvaLB5> A FORENSIC AUDIT is needed in Michigan to ascertain legal votes @MISenate @MI_Republicans it's clear some fraud &amp; irregularities took place @LeeChatfield @SenMikeShirkey   Many of us in Michigan do not believe our votes were counted or mattered to State Officials!
1334323604482355207 2020-12-03 10:28:32 +0800 <EvaLB5> @DavidWaddell5 @maga4trumpUSA BTW it's MI House Oversight committee which are Dems &amp; Republicans
1334323383320911872 2020-12-03 10:27:39 +0800 <EvaLB5> @DavidWaddell5 @maga4trumpUSA They had no intention of helping in THIS past Election from the get go!

1334317971968315392 2020-12-03 10:06:09 +0800 <EvaLB5> Yes All she would do is attack them &amp; called last witnesses a liar! That's what @MI_Republicans oversight committee treated Michiganders who came forward &amp; they were told clearly, each witness had sworn affidavits 🤬 Disgraceful
1334317384476356608 2020-12-03 10:03:49 +0800 <EvaLB5> Sorry @kayleighmcenany we don't believe one word from CNN and certainly not Anderson
1334295740621987840 2020-12-03 08:37:49 +0800 <EvaLB5> What a rude bunch of representatives we're witnessing in @MI_Republicans Oversight committee
1334295048964464640 2020-12-03 08:35:04 +0800 <EvaLB5> Here in Berrien County we're required to show ID when we vote @MI_Republicans not sure why a Grand Rapids Rep said it's not required in MI. And then mocked witness for thinking it's required. @MISenate
1334290421829218308 2020-12-03 08:16:41 +0800 <EvaLB5> @mgriffithshow The mask when they're taking isn't needed. They should have placed time limit in witness, like the Senate did. Can't spend an hour on one when there's only 3 hours total.
1334288360265887746 2020-12-03 08:08:29 +0800 <EvaLB5> An hour for one person. Can't be this long....get to the point
1334286719785570304 2020-12-03 08:01:58 +0800 <EvaLB5> @JennaEllisEsq too long on one person &amp; confusing. Please try to highlight points &amp; hand WRITTEN copies to Legislators or something. Can't spend an hour on one person
1334275660651454466 2020-12-03 07:18:01 +0800 <EvaLB5> Whitmer patsy disrupts hearing right off the bat.
1334274375319769092 2020-12-03 07:12:55 +0800 <EvaLB5> There was no audit done on votes. They found problems, but nothing done yet. Not good to start with excuses IMHO
1334273274495250435 2020-12-03 07:08:32 +0800 <EvaLB5> @tiogamom1 @RudyGiuliani Oh we have. They're spineless
1334273201011105793 2020-12-03 07:08:15 +0800 <EvaLB5> @KelemenCari @RudyGiuliani That part is true.  The Speaker of House said it's a hearing but won't change anything 🤷‍♀️  We've been calling &amp; fighting but they're weak. Let's hope they need Jenna's info on Constitution.
1334271223954550785 2020-12-03 07:00:24 +0800 <EvaLB5> It's great @RudyGiuliani will present to MI House Oversight committee but they'll be just as useless as yesterday &amp; I'd be surprised if anything gets done. Spineless lot!
1334270413464100864 2020-12-03 06:57:10 +0800 <EvaLB5> Oh, it's the House Oversight committee in MI. Can't expect much from them, unfortunately
1334269854061383681 2020-12-03 06:54:57 +0800 <EvaLB5> Someone said nothing can be done by MI Legislators. That's wrong. The Constitution covers all States &amp; there are things that can be done. Tune in at 6 when @RudyGiuliani @JennaEllisEsq are there in MI. I'll watch on @RSBNetwork

1333918190997532673 2020-12-02 07:37:34 +0800 <EvaLB5> Michigan is a beautiful State. But it's becoming horrible with current"leadership" and it's beyond disturbing
1333917925271613443 2020-12-02 07:36:31 +0800 <EvaLB5> @JoyceEScott1 👍👍

1333917633687793664 2020-12-02 07:35:21 +0800 <EvaLB5> @dlnarch Yes. But, originally Durham was definitely going to bring Indictments, nit report. That's changed and we can expect nothing. It's unbelievable what's going on
1333916941174583297 2020-12-02 07:32:36 +0800 <EvaLB5> @Wizard_Predicts And the coup goes onwards
1333916711389716480 2020-12-02 07:31:41 +0800 <EvaLB5> Durham became irrelevant thanks to Barr 🤦
1333908121333477381 2020-12-02 06:57:33 +0800 <EvaLB5> @BmoreRight @smalltownandrew That's what I said.... I never rely on what news tells me either; they always leave parts out.

1333886020044156932 2020-12-02 05:29:44 +0800 <EvaLB5> Again video switched from @RSBNetwork to NTD 2d time
1333883225530277888 2020-12-02 05:18:37 +0800 <EvaLB5> What's with the cell phone by Senate Lisetio (?) No reason to take pictures or video; everything is recorded visually and audio @MISenate @SenEdMcBroom this hearing is beyond disturbing &amp; we have right to hear the witnesses in full. @MIGOP we have serious problems!

1333861770545524738 2020-12-02 03:53:22 +0800 <EvaLB5> If everyone had a mask on, social distancing is a lame excuse @MISenate @SenEdMcBroom we're tired if politicizing COVID
1333861585358610439 2020-12-02 03:52:38 +0800 <EvaLB5> @NCPatriotMom @rianne22497716 Constitution should, but it's a coup for certain. Very disappointing in lack of Accountability and Justice
1333861028648652802 2020-12-02 03:50:25 +0800 <EvaLB5> @Media__Ferret @Draw33 Betrayal is forever
1333860818753101829 2020-12-02 03:49:35 +0800 <EvaLB5> @texasGSDgirl His distinctions are truly think. I also wanted to believe him, but since zero has been done, DOJ has become worse &amp; worse. It's sad indeed
1333859229225127938 2020-12-02 03:43:16 +0800 <EvaLB5> We have no Justice in our Nation. No Accountability, responsibility or Indictments. Fear has taken over  It's appalling
1333856505964191745 2020-12-02 03:32:27 +0800 <EvaLB5> Wooohooo Exactly how we feel 👏👏👏
1333854644829818885 2020-12-02 03:25:03 +0800 <EvaLB5> COVID is excuse for not allowing observers to see ballots 🙄
1333854486092275714 2020-12-02 03:24:25 +0800 <EvaLB5> That was a troubling statement &amp; proved they don't know their Constitutional Duties
1333854089617281025 2020-12-02 03:22:51 +0800 <EvaLB5> These citizens took time from their lives to speak out and they're given 3 minutes! It's outrageous. We don't believe they'll read anything, nor do anything #MichiganHearing
1333852387161874436 2020-12-02 03:16:05 +0800 <EvaLB5> @DineshDSouza @2600Khz It was intriguing to watch.

1333849493297631232 2020-12-02 03:04:35 +0800 <EvaLB5> Agreed. The Cmte is vicious, rude and dismissive of witnesses @RSBNetwork  It's disgraceful what we're seeing @MISenate Oversight committee is wasting time &amp; disheartening to watch @SenEdMcBroom #MichiganHearing  Let them tell their testimony &amp; not be silenced.
1333831169562042370 2020-12-02 01:51:46 +0800 <EvaLB5> No wonder we have so many serious issues in Michigan. This is troubling on several levels #MichiganHearing Harassment of witnesses and rudeness is unacceptable 🤬

1333827526423142402 2020-12-02 01:37:18 +0800 <EvaLB5> Well, now lasieto (?) Looks gravely concerned 🤔 Could be? This is reprehensible! Dems mock &amp; rude to witness. #MichiganHearing
1333824611688062977 2020-12-02 01:25:43 +0800 <EvaLB5> Lasieto thinks he's a Judge and acts like a prosecutor Not an elected official who works for Michiganders
1333823210652131329 2020-12-02 01:20:09 +0800 <EvaLB5> What is tomorrow? Hopefully, not like this Oversight committee 🤨
1333820209157857281 2020-12-02 01:08:13 +0800 <EvaLB5> This Lasito doesn't realize what Legislators have to do as opposed to criminal complaints to AG. This is awful and he believes the Senators have no Constitutional Duties 🤔 &amp; is arrogantly dismissive. This is horrid &amp; troubling for Michigan cc @MIGOP @MIGOPChair @MISenate
1333818683068715010 2020-12-02 01:02:09 +0800 <EvaLB5> Please remember you have Constitutional Duties not just policy making. Actually, you're Legislators @SenEdMcBroom the rudeness is unacceptable on your Cmte. #MichiganHearing @MISenate you're obligated to help your Constituents, not bash them!
1333817158372093955 2020-12-02 00:56:06 +0800 <EvaLB5> Either wear your mask properly or take it off #MichiganHearing
1333816656087441411 2020-12-02 00:54:06 +0800 <EvaLB5> Disgraceful watching this mockery. They think they're only policy makers. Guess their Constitutional Duties don't matter?? Michigan is lost with these rude, spineless Legislators
1333815584082038785 2020-12-02 00:49:50 +0800 <EvaLB5> They're answer is take it to State AG and DOJ 🤔 #MichiganElection #MichiganHearing  Disgraceful. You have Constitutional Duties Senators, not just policy 🤬  what a farce @MISenate we're seeing they don't care
1333814985475186688 2020-12-02 00:47:28 +0800 <EvaLB5> They're not going to do anything to fix anything
1333814824942366721 2020-12-02 00:46:50 +0800 <EvaLB5> This moron expects Citizens to do their work 🤨😳
1333814436663095298 2020-12-02 00:45:17 +0800 <EvaLB5> @MAGAGwen @wvufanagent99 @SenEdMcBroom They're not able to give detailed report in 3 minutes &amp; they know it. We're not able to hear their testimony in full 🤬 #MichiganHearing
1333813349709193219 2020-12-02 00:40:58 +0800 <EvaLB5> I have to figure out how to put OANN on my tv, not my pc  Will figure it out.

1333812372285296641 2020-12-02 00:37:05 +0800 <EvaLB5> Not at all. It's outrageous what's going on. It's not Oversight, it's mockery of our system #MichiganHearing

1333811591045926912 2020-12-02 00:33:58 +0800 <EvaLB5> My goodness, witnesses are not allowed to speak a decent amount of time for us to hear what they've seen  #MichiganHearing @MISenate disgraceful &amp; disheartening listening to this Oversight committee @MIGOP
1333810754001252354 2020-12-02 00:30:39 +0800 <EvaLB5> @thebruce_robert I said he sounds like Schifff. This is State hearing not Washington DC I'm watching @RSBNetwork
1333810553563836419 2020-12-02 00:29:51 +0800 <EvaLB5> Now we see why Whitmer gets away with everything
1333808022800510976 2020-12-02 00:19:48 +0800 <EvaLB5> They're asking witnesses for name, address &amp; phone number of those they saw with suspicious activity 🙄🙄  This Cmte is a joke &amp; that one heavy set guy thinks he's in Court &amp; the Judge  #MichiganHearing  What a mess!
1333807564463747077 2020-12-02 00:17:58 +0800 <EvaLB5> @JackySinAZ @MIGOPChair @MIGOP @MISenate Absolutely
1333807322796322816 2020-12-02 00:17:01 +0800 <EvaLB5> lol Giving 3 minutes to each witness. Must be like Schiff running this bogus, show Cmte #MichiganHearing

1333806361306664969 2020-12-02 00:13:12 +0800 <EvaLB5> @JackySinAZ @MIGOPChair @MIGOP @MISenate Hummmm, I sit corrected then. Thank you. Yes, it's oversight committee and would explain nasty attacks against witnesses. Let's hope Republicans stay strong.
1333805730646937604 2020-12-02 00:10:41 +0800 <EvaLB5> @JackySinAZ @MIGOPChair @MIGOP @MISenate They're REPUBLICANS State Senators  Why it's annoying &amp; disgraceful attacking witness!
1333804905098833925 2020-12-02 00:07:24 +0800 <EvaLB5> This Cmte is disgraceful. Attacking the witnesses 😳 That's @MIGOPChair @MIGOP @MISenate quite the contrast after listening to AZ &amp; PA. Spineless Oversight committee attacking witnesses!
1333800907339751427 2020-12-01 23:51:31 +0800 <EvaLB5> These Republican Senators will do nothing; cowards #MichiganHearing excuses they'll make to justify their spinless inaction
1333800419869433863 2020-12-01 23:49:35 +0800 <EvaLB5> Live showing of @MISenate Oversight committee on Election Integrity on @RSBNetwork in entirety. Again, it's a hearing, not a trial!  Legislators must investigate quickly. We're hearing excuses from the get go #MichiganHearing
1333799667314814985 2020-12-01 23:46:36 +0800 <EvaLB5> Cowards

1333793710094487557 2020-12-01 23:22:55 +0800 <EvaLB5> Spineless MI Republicans  Hope I'm wrong, but so far that's been the case. Good talk game &amp; that's about it 🤨
1333793461770756096 2020-12-01 23:21:56 +0800 <EvaLB5> Fantastic We can see all the Trump people gathered outside #MichiganHearing 👍🇺🇸👍 thank you Patriots and @RSBNetwork showing in entirety

1333742700592574468 2020-12-01 20:00:14 +0800 <EvaLB5> Biden, literally, "getting the boot" 🙃
1333741283031064576 2020-12-01 19:54:36 +0800 <EvaLB5> @Rushgurl Guess he missed the point - Jesus didn't come to save the Saints, but to Save the sinners!    We'll pray for David &amp; others who "don't get it" and staying closed, will never be able to understand us and our Love for others.
1333736054835322881 2020-12-01 19:33:49 +0800 <EvaLB5> @MaeWunder @JohnJamesMI Agreed. I was surprised as well; thought he'd stay until the end. Disappointing for future consideration of any seat.

1333230689983016960 2020-11-30 10:05:41 +0800 <EvaLB5> What privilege to be able to go to an Orthopedist clinic on Sunday and receive treatment.  Us little people go to ER or some clinic if it's open on Sunday, and slim chance of seeing an Orthopedic Dr. for a sprained ankle.

1333024742153080834 2020-11-29 20:27:19 +0800 <EvaLB5> So, a law written that is not challenged immediately after it's passed into law, cannot be challenged any time afterwards by anyone who believes the law was broken at a later date🤦‍♀️  Is that right? IDK, I'm not a lawyer, but that seems odd for a State Supreme Court. SMH

Checked Bank and NO check showed up. FIRST time ever IRS mailing didn't arrive. Maybe it was shredded with the Trump votes 🤷‍♀️ BTW, we're in MI!

1332318792253386753 2020-11-27 21:42:08 +0800 <EvaLB5> There is NO  "MSM" It's propaganda media &amp; complicit in corruption; it appears more and more clearly each day. It's the media spewing hatred, lies, disrespect &amp; threats to those who disagree &amp; it's been 4 years &amp; counting!   There is NO "press" any longer; only political hacks!

Our 1st Amendment matters &amp; signaling out Religious Bodies is plainly biased.
1331909605430071296 2020-11-26 18:36:10 +0800 <EvaLB5> Great thread. The deceit by propaganda media seems to vilify anyone who disagrees with them. Rather than reporting merits of cases, they attack. Sad indeed. Everyone knows what's been happening in NYC, and I for one, am glad Religious Freedom has been preserved!

1331213321727586304 2020-11-24 20:29:23 +0800 <EvaLB5> @Tombstone1954 And after opening statement, it was constant "post-Trump" this and that. I turned off after trying to listen to her logic. I won't bothering tuning in again! BUT, it ain't over despite what these corrupt politicians say &amp; our "conservative" media. I won't quit until Trump does!
1331212653646274565 2020-11-24 20:26:44 +0800 <EvaLB5> Magical &amp; marvelous :)
1331205999164841993 2020-11-24 20:00:17 +0800 <EvaLB5> Doesn't it seem odd how we see social media manipulate accounts, yet many deny "machines" can be set up to cheat 🤔 Social media itself PROVES it most certainly can be manipulated and set for specific outcomes!   Strange evidence indeed.

1331201565038874624 2020-11-24 19:42:40 +0800 <EvaLB5> It's not about popularity, it's how this "system" operates. Amazing when you see the inconsistencies and obvious manipulations.  Just a short rant this am, thanks for reading.
1331201229863723014 2020-11-24 19:41:20 +0800 <EvaLB5> I've been on Twitter for over 10 years, took 4 years off due to circumstances beyond my control, and here we are! Came back, and cannot receive interactions as before. A few likes, fewer RT's, and a few replies. I haven't changed, but somehow, deep hatred has filled the venue.
1331200549375635462 2020-11-24 19:38:38 +0800 <EvaLB5> Too many say "this is not about Trump".  Well, let me be clear:  IT IS ABOUT TRUMP &amp; his consistent fight for our CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC, LAW &amp; ORDER, and AMERICA FIRST.  That is what we support &amp; fight for, and to say differently perpetuates the corruption we've endured!
1331194732865859584 2020-11-24 19:15:31 +0800 <EvaLB5> It is much too early to start hearing, let alone saying, post-Trump.....  I was appalled at hearing that, and will not give up until it's over. I will never side with tyranny, corruption, and sedition!  NEVER!

1330997021541605377 2020-11-24 06:09:53 +0800 <EvaLB5> I guess threats are ok now in MI since it's all from Dems. Evidently, Republican members are cowards! It's beyond disheartening @MIGOPChair
1330975415347916801 2020-11-24 04:44:02 +0800 <EvaLB5> Honestly don't understand why any GOVERNOR would want to hurt their States/Commonwealth so badly. Ruining lives, small businesses, restaurants and tourism 💰. It's not hurting Trump, it's hurting the "little people" 🤬

1330855113389469699 2020-11-23 20:45:59 +0800 <EvaLB5> It's easier to be a critic than a seeker.
1330854869733961730 2020-11-23 20:45:01 +0800 <EvaLB5> Long ago on Lipton tea bag tags, they used to have sayings and this one always stuck with me as it proved true:  "It's not so important to be serious, as it is to be serious about the important"! #WeThePeople #HoldTheLine
1330854528556687362 2020-11-23 20:43:40 +0800 <EvaLB5> Spot on. I've always believed: No one is more important than me, and I'm not more important than anyone else! Such an important concept.
1330850521104658437 2020-11-23 20:27:44 +0800 <EvaLB5> huh? Intimidation doxing, and threats are ok? The 3 top officials in MI are beyond words!

1330822301747720194 2020-11-23 18:35:36 +0800 <EvaLB5> It seems to me we truly won/flipped the House, but there appears to be some "glitches" 🤔 #FightBack
1330822077771821057 2020-11-23 18:34:43 +0800 <EvaLB5> Good morning #MAGA and Trumplicans.  It's another day to be blessed or to bless others; courage remains!
1330821571154423808 2020-11-23 18:32:42 +0800 <EvaLB5> @ChatChristi @steph93065 So true!
1330820777306968066 2020-11-23 18:29:33 +0800 <EvaLB5> @steph93065 We drove around yesterday in SW MI and yes, many have their Trump out &amp; signs still up, and Trump flags waving. #WeThePeople
1330814491462946818 2020-11-23 18:04:34 +0800 <EvaLB5> Sidney Powell represents me.  KEEP IT GOING   #TeamSidney  #WeThePeople (use the hashtags)

1330813223868755968 2020-11-23 17:59:32 +0800 <EvaLB5> @FKUJAK1 Yes. What's happening in our Nation, mainly by Dems &amp; their propaganda media is a complete disgrace to all who have fought &amp; served this great Country for our freedoms, liberty and peace. Truth will prevail!

1330674571800932357 2020-11-23 08:48:35 +0800 <EvaLB5> Period.
1330674240845180929 2020-11-23 08:47:16 +0800 <EvaLB5> @DentyLinda As Trump's personal lawyer, yes
1330673461434458118 2020-11-23 08:44:10 +0800 <EvaLB5> Exactly.
1330669369073012737 2020-11-23 08:27:54 +0800 <EvaLB5> Clarification @DineshDSouza nothing more
1330668446418423808 2020-11-23 08:24:14 +0800 <EvaLB5> Sidney is a lawyer. Sidney never said she represented PRESIDENT Trump, or a member of Trump's legal team. Sidney did say she's #FightingBack and fighting for Election Integrity &amp; the steal from the American people!  #HoldTheLine
1330667707205869568 2020-11-23 08:21:18 +0800 <EvaLB5> @GoJackFlynn An outstanding lawyer!

1330661430933196805 2020-11-23 07:56:22 +0800 <EvaLB5> @sofka_juyne Oh, I've learned that, painfully 😊
1330661061301776386 2020-11-23 07:54:54 +0800 <EvaLB5> @RealJohnSandor @JennaEllisEsq Agreed
1330660636293001216 2020-11-23 07:53:12 +0800 <EvaLB5> @sofka_juyne Not necessarily; can't name what it is, but something off. It's not judgement, just a sense.
1330660034112614401 2020-11-23 07:50:49 +0800 <EvaLB5> @DineshDSouza Clarification Nothing else!
1330659753970847748 2020-11-23 07:49:42 +0800 <EvaLB5> I watch Jenna carefully bcs while I believe she's seen the light since her CNN days, there's still something off IMHO

1330655929126293506 2020-11-23 07:34:30 +0800 <EvaLB5> **of**
1330655836981620738 2020-11-23 07:34:08 +0800 <EvaLB5> And Sidney gets it clearly what's going on, and the workings of the Swamp &amp; Deep State!
1330655600229949443 2020-11-23 07:33:12 +0800 <EvaLB5> @TallStoneMason 🤔  We'll certainly see in the near future!
1330655316787204097 2020-11-23 07:32:04 +0800 <EvaLB5> WOW @PBS is showing "A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving" tonight at 7:30 pm est. Nice if them 😊
1330652543245037569 2020-11-23 07:21:03 +0800 <EvaLB5> @TallStoneMason @realDonaldTrump @SidneyPowell1 Agreed that it could have been written in a more clearly stated fashion. We also have to remember there are accusations that taxpayers money is paying her and others when it is not the case. As we understand it, much of the $$ is from Team Trump Campaign.
1330651519289610240 2020-11-23 07:16:59 +0800 <EvaLB5> Again, many of us believe Sidney wouldn't put her reputation on the line in a very public way if there wasn't a HUGE there to begin with.  And, she certainly wouldn't be GEN Flynn's lawyer if she wasn't great at what she does!
1330650926567354370 2020-11-23 07:14:37 +0800 <EvaLB5> @DentyLinda IDK for sure, but it does NOT seem they are throwing her under the bus, but rather plain old clarification of roles &amp; official titles (which to many seem important).   We move onwards.
1330650621087715333 2020-11-23 07:13:25 +0800 <EvaLB5> Exactly. Sidney never claimed to be a member or personal lawyer for President Trump. But, she is working diligently on this entire past election fiasco/chaos. Clarification is more for those who aren't paying attention as the propaganda media spins their bs daily!
1330649855727968258 2020-11-23 07:10:22 +0800 <EvaLB5> Please stay calm as we carry on and seek to PROVE the truth that this past election was indeed fraud &amp; cheating on a large scale.  Pay attention to who is involved, and always FOLLOW the money IMHO
1330649488260788225 2020-11-23 07:08:54 +0800 <EvaLB5> @TallStoneMason Don't think so, and highly doubt it. It's the lies &amp; bs being spread by propaganda media accusing them of lies &amp; deceit.  It's more role clarification and plain explanation for media that doesn't pay attention or do their own investigations!
1330649013679501318 2020-11-23 07:07:01 +0800 <EvaLB5> Same old bull$h!t, different day when it comes to the propaganda media which are in fact, the enemy of the people!
1330648826663886850 2020-11-23 07:06:17 +0800 <EvaLB5> Clarification of roles &amp; official titles do not negate the fact that several lawyers @SidneyPowell1 @LLinWood @PamBondi @VicToensing &amp; hubby Joe DiGenova are working on fraud &amp; irregularities in this past election.  It's bcs propaganda media trying to discredit folks etc...
1330647895322882049 2020-11-23 07:02:35 +0800 <EvaLB5> @SidneyPowell1 is working on voter fraud case in support of President @realDonaldTrump legal case, as are other lawyers as well.. She was at news conference with @JennaEllisEsq @RudyGiuliani who are indeed lawyers working for Trump. It's a clarification for propaganda media.
1330601953857048577 2020-11-23 04:00:01 +0800 <EvaLB5> And yet she didn't bcs she knew the sham she would unleash. And why would she want to be caught? After all, Trump knows!

1329562010070245377 2020-11-20 07:07:39 +0800 <EvaLB5> Wtheck He's not PRESIDENT-Elect! And if Kamala believes she's VP-ELECT then vacate her SENATE Seat now!

1329554431688503300 2020-11-20 06:37:33 +0800 <EvaLB5> gorgeous day again today and mild temps - was great getting out while we can enjoy the beautiful sunshine  now, back to the grudges, threats and exposing them all  ROFL
1329554109767290880 2020-11-20 06:36:16 +0800 <EvaLB5> @JackySinAZ Just when I thought she was OK, the past few days leave many questions.... I'm actually enjoying the evening shows on @newsmax as well
1329552804118192129 2020-11-20 06:31:05 +0800 <EvaLB5> He is beyond pathetic and hate filled old frigggin___________!
1329552585196531717 2020-11-20 06:30:12 +0800 <EvaLB5> Before she was red pilled and worked on cnn with their mind trips, so it's all good. She's been nothing but outright supportive and we MAGA have forgiveness in our hearts! No room to talk Laura!
1329435444447154177 2020-11-19 22:44:44 +0800 <EvaLB5> @Phyllis94584953 he's in quarantine having contacted COVID
1329416157246394368 2020-11-19 21:28:05 +0800 <EvaLB5> WHEN do new members of HOUSE &amp; SENATE get Sworn IN? I don't believe they have YET. But, votes for "leaders" still went onwards; why? They complained about SCOTUS pick, but promote voting for themselves. SMH
1329404811364720640 2020-11-19 20:43:00 +0800 <EvaLB5> @DeanBrowningPA The one I've said for months now. Not perfect, but reasonable!

1329400699273228288 2020-11-19 20:26:40 +0800 <EvaLB5> He sure has a lot of successes for being "inadequate". These people...

1329388865145229314 2020-11-19 19:39:38 +0800 <EvaLB5> The instant attacks against elected officials is mind boggling. To state disagreement, so be it, but vile name calling, and blatant threats are a no go, aren't they? Good example - MICHIGAN
1329382776001409025 2020-11-19 19:15:27 +0800 <EvaLB5> Let's hope this is true! Her tweet and appearance on MSNBC right after initial vote by R in MI was threatening and virtual signaling others to act as they did. SoS needs to go as well!
1329232918905032711 2020-11-19 09:19:58 +0800 <EvaLB5> @izzysroses @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani Doesn't appear true But nowadays, who knows

1329199949091893249 2020-11-19 07:08:57 +0800 <EvaLB5> Obviously, there's a plan and it won't be rapid. We're more than equipped to give a rapid response to any attack, anywhere. It's disturbing that too many want to stay at war. Twenty years us enough &amp; large presence there is no longer needed.
1329196286684385281 2020-11-19 06:54:24 +0800 <EvaLB5> Why does Cuomo have to be on TV every day....

1329148671116648448 2020-11-19 03:45:12 +0800 <EvaLB5> Yes @TheLeoTerrell should be seated in Kamala Harris vacated seat ASAP

1329117865224581126 2020-11-19 01:42:47 +0800 <EvaLB5> Stop watching F &amp; F on weekends also @newsmax @CarlHigbie instead  But, please expand morning live news/programs, Thank you

1329101225724403715 2020-11-19 00:36:40 +0800 <EvaLB5> What? Are observers there just to watch people? Then yes, it's pointless. But, they're there to view the ballots &amp; they're legit or not.  Wtheck is wrong with the Judiciary 🤷

1329098097230811140 2020-11-19 00:24:14 +0800 <EvaLB5> GOP is weak &amp; cowards!
1329098027332739075 2020-11-19 00:23:57 +0800 <EvaLB5> Propaganda media are indeed the enermy of the people and are causing chaos, division and deeper hatred. It's appalling
1329097743814496256 2020-11-19 00:22:50 +0800 <EvaLB5> No data supports this shutdown and it hurts a great deal of business and people!  As I've said, consistently matters &amp; there's nothing to warrant shutting down restaurants again; it's killing their businesses

1329056758749388802 2020-11-18 21:39:58 +0800 <EvaLB5> @1Untergrund @ChatChristi @JedediahBila a dumb attempt at trolling &amp; obvious disregard for any viewers
1329054858637434884 2020-11-18 21:32:25 +0800 <EvaLB5> @ChatChristi I tried but stopped watching F&amp; F after a few week-ends.  And haven't watch any FNC during weekends at all for over a year. But, she's one of  the absolute worse &amp; unwatchable.
1329054399696695298 2020-11-18 21:30:36 +0800 <EvaLB5> We have ZERO faith in the Governor, SoS and AG; they are clearly Trump haters and blatant partisan operatives. It's disheartening what's going on!
1329053960745914369 2020-11-18 21:28:51 +0800 <EvaLB5> @ChatChristi @realDonaldTrump I'm there 10000%
1329052357133553664 2020-11-18 21:22:29 +0800 <EvaLB5> Arrogance usually follows ignorance Yea, I said it!
1329048358372184064 2020-11-18 21:06:35 +0800 <EvaLB5> She'll do nothing to restore Integrity in MI Votes   The 3 at "top" are full pledged partisan players &amp; Trump haters.
1329047712130617344 2020-11-18 21:04:01 +0800 <EvaLB5> Golden Girls
1329046832782188545 2020-11-18 21:00:32 +0800 <EvaLB5> Consistency matters
1329046285903671299 2020-11-18 20:58:21 +0800 <EvaLB5> 🔥🔥
1329045990297448448 2020-11-18 20:57:11 +0800 <EvaLB5> Nothing will change. Wayne County is a stronghold for D &amp; have been under their control for decades
1329039402404884480 2020-11-18 20:31:00 +0800 <EvaLB5> There's public knowledge and then there's intimidation &amp; virtual threats, aren't there? All this after Governor's tweet; there's NO coincidences!
1329036545194647553 2020-11-18 20:19:39 +0800 <EvaLB5> I trust @SidneyPowell1 @LLinWood @RudyGiuliani @JaySekulow are aware of MI &amp;  other State's tactics and intimidation?
1329036134874288129 2020-11-18 20:18:01 +0800 <EvaLB5> ⚠️⚠️⚠️
1329035863863517185 2020-11-18 20:16:56 +0800 <EvaLB5> CORRECT. But how we witnessed the vote was quite appalling &amp; an eye opener how threatening &amp; destructive D's are.
1329035685588766720 2020-11-18 20:16:14 +0800 <EvaLB5> INDEPENDENT AUDIT not the MI SoS who will do nothing to have an honest audit.
1329035369623531528 2020-11-18 20:14:59 +0800 <EvaLB5> It happened AFTER Governor's intimidation and virtual signaling via tweet &amp; immediate appearance on MSNBC. Within an hour votes were changed to unanimous! Not too long after, SoS rejoiced via tweet. @MISenate how can you let these tactics stand @SenMikeShirkey @matthewmaddock
1329033675024068608 2020-11-18 20:08:15 +0800 <EvaLB5> And here is MI SoS celebrating the cheat. She'll do nothing to legitimize the votes. It's truly disheartening to see such hatred &amp; partisanship from all 3 "top" officials in MI.
1329032915825651716 2020-11-18 20:05:14 +0800 <EvaLB5> She virtual signaled the "mob", went on MSNBC, threats against R began, and poof - the vote was changed to unanimous. Nothing to see there, let's move on SMH
1329026241576521735 2020-11-18 19:38:42 +0800 <EvaLB5> As I've been saying - those 3 at the "top" are the worst &amp; I don't trust anything from them. MI is a bad example of Identity politics. It seems people just voted for (female) with no idea who they are SMH
1329023549902884866 2020-11-18 19:28:01 +0800 <EvaLB5> @JoshuaBevier @MIGOPChair @matthewmaddock No, you're not confused. That appears to be what happened

1328908974889066497 2020-11-18 11:52:44 +0800 <EvaLB5> We can't and don't  SoS will do nothing.

1328905988402012163 2020-11-18 11:40:52 +0800 <EvaLB5> @KMurrayCoach @MISenate I don't think that's true since many more areas, districts have encountered descrepencies. It's not about race, it's about power.

1328897268573941760 2020-11-18 11:06:13 +0800 <EvaLB5> @AuditDir_Jay First vote was because votes didn't match numbers who signed in to vote. And then they changed votes &amp; left audit to Benson. That's a waste of time. I didn't say anything about corruption btw.
1328896310917951491 2020-11-18 11:02:24 +0800 <EvaLB5> @BLUNTFRANKHACKS Well in Wayne County case, they felt afraid and changed votes.  You should investigate before vote, nit after
1328895824537989123 2020-11-18 11:00:28 +0800 <EvaLB5> @barbedwirebarb @HeidiLMartin @MISenate Sigh
1328895618463522817 2020-11-18 10:59:39 +0800 <EvaLB5> We can't jump to conclusions
1328895561634893824 2020-11-18 10:59:26 +0800 <EvaLB5> And poof, Wayne County in MI vote unanimous &amp; certified. Governor's appearance on msnbc right after signaled &amp; poof, threats came rushing in. It's disgusting  @MIGOPChair @matthewmaddock please stop this partisan abuser if power!
1328895016429871106 2020-11-18 10:57:16 +0800 <EvaLB5> @Lisa77720 @CNN @fox @MSNBC @nbc Nope They changed
1328894919444992000 2020-11-18 10:56:53 +0800 <EvaLB5> Well GOVERNOR accomplished her mission running to MSNBC and signaling Republicans were partisan etc...and immediately threats came pouring in! It's reprehensible @MIGOPChair @MISenate @matthewmaddock we're 🤬
1328893426893533185 2020-11-18 10:50:57 +0800 <EvaLB5> @KipperSkidller Yes. She should be impeached
1328893298883309571 2020-11-18 10:50:26 +0800 <EvaLB5> Reports are bcs of intimidation &amp; threats they changed course &amp; certified votes in Wayne County now. This is crazy President @realDonaldTrump &amp; @MIGOPChair
1328892476535562241 2020-11-18 10:47:10 +0800 <EvaLB5> What?  Was this because of Governor's statement of intimidation and signaling threats against the two Republicans? And running to TV to repeat signaling?  This us an outrage @MIGOPChair @MISenate
1328891133867520000 2020-11-18 10:41:50 +0800 <EvaLB5> @KipperSkidller That may be our only option
1328889242559406089 2020-11-18 10:34:19 +0800 <EvaLB5> @SonyaSkelton @MISenate Awful and  ignores Judges and Legislators. Now she attacks election officials bcs they're Republicans
1328888838639513605 2020-11-18 10:32:43 +0800 <EvaLB5> @WomenForKAG @realDonaldTrump And common sense 🙄
1328888513136390145 2020-11-18 10:31:25 +0800 <EvaLB5> There were descrepencies with number if votes in the County. The Canvassers should not be shamed or attacked bcs of their votes as witnessed by Governor's statement. It's disgraceful!
1328887718143811584 2020-11-18 10:28:16 +0800 <EvaLB5> The Wayne County Canvassers found votes didn't match numbers who signed. Actually, the 2 Republicans voted based on discrepancies they couldn't validate the votes. But, MI Gov ran to MSNBC &amp; made accusations and intimidating statements against them; it's disgraceful @MISenate
1328885970377314305 2020-11-18 10:21:19 +0800 <EvaLB5> And the Governor has already issued a statement that appeared intimidating, partisan attack, and interfering in County Canvassers. And then she said it on TV. It's disgraceful!
1328883465530519553 2020-11-18 10:11:22 +0800 <EvaLB5> @MIRedState @realDonaldTrump She's appalling 🤬
1328883358030569474 2020-11-18 10:10:56 +0800 <EvaLB5> Disgraceful from Governor Whitmer. Slandering anyone for doing their duty is  signalling to Board of Canvassers &amp; it's intimidation.Partisan, hate filled rhetoric by her is troubling @MISenate @SenMikeShirkey enough of her abuse of power, accusing officials bcs their Republican
1328881921649217536 2020-11-18 10:05:14 +0800 <EvaLB5> Intimidation &amp; partisan politics are from you Governor, nit the officials who are voting their hands on visual process. Accusing them of anything different is beyond reprehensible. @MISenate @SenMikeShirkey When will this blatant abuse of power end @matthewmaddock @DetmerMike
1328881113838850050 2020-11-18 10:02:01 +0800 <EvaLB5> This us outrageous @MISenate and her partisan bias is interference in voting process. The members fulfilled their duty based on votes &amp; problems encountered. Her virtual signalling should not intimated any other officials in MI. And she runs right to TV cameras! @SenMikeShirkey
1328880125262389248 2020-11-18 09:58:05 +0800 <EvaLB5> @MIRedState @GovWhitmer @realDonaldTrump @MIGOP Her statement seems like interference in an election process. To accuse people  doing their duty of being partisan is beyond anything decent. Equally, her signalling is revolting. She's the partisan element as she refuses to work with Legislators. @DetmerMike  @MISenate

1328678630399090688 2020-11-17 20:37:25 +0800 <EvaLB5> An audit should include districts for "squad" members, especially Talib (MI) &amp; Omar (MN). It's difficult to believe anyone would vote for these hate filled persons to be in Congress.
1328678083021434881 2020-11-17 20:35:15 +0800 <EvaLB5> I've been asking that for years - elected officials from Congress &amp; Senate should not speak out against America and millions of US Citizens.

1328676926458826753 2020-11-17 20:30:39 +0800 <EvaLB5> Why is this hate speech tolerated by an "elected official" in our Congress?

1328284582274330624 2020-11-16 18:31:37 +0800 <EvaLB5> YOU cannot control any disease or virus by locking people down and removing their freedoms &amp; liberties. It's been 10 months, and despite all the control, the virus lives!  duh!
1328271248992907265 2020-11-16 17:38:38 +0800 <EvaLB5> Good Morning Reading the comments under Michiganders, and it's mind boggling how they're just about ALL in favor of being controlled.  Blatant lies and vulgarity towards the MI GOP Led Legislative Branch,  right under their charts of china virus actions. IT'S POLITICAL 100%
1328270470265905154 2020-11-16 17:35:32 +0800 <EvaLB5> every tweet (minus a very few) from our President @realDonaldTrump has this false warning (censorship). It's lovely how they're providing their own evidence for Congress change to 230 :) @HawleyMO @SenTedCruz  They're beyond disgraceful!

1328123476704686081 2020-11-16 07:51:26 +0800 <EvaLB5> I don't believe 100 are dying each week from COVID-19 in Michigan as Governor claims. These restrictions are power grabs &amp; wrong. Is she above the law, does she not have to abide by Judicial Branch either? Are there 3 Governing Branches in MI? Wtheck. People are hurting 🤬
1328122549889355776 2020-11-16 07:47:45 +0800 <EvaLB5> @SenMikeShirkey @MISenate The MI Supreme Court voted these orders unlawful since EXECUTIVE BRANCH is not working with LEGISLATIVE BRANCH.

1328120398031040516 2020-11-16 07:39:12 +0800 <EvaLB5> She just refuses to work with MI Legislative Branch &amp; is mandating from Executive Branch exclusively. Does MI Supreme Court ruling not matter; is she above the law? @MISenate @MIGOP @MIGOPChair enough already
1328119896035749890 2020-11-16 07:37:13 +0800 <EvaLB5> So she can ignore the MI Supreme Court?
1328119364516786176 2020-11-16 07:35:06 +0800 <EvaLB5> And she vetoes it. She's using HHS &amp; that's wrong to have this go on 10 months now. So many hurting &amp; loss of income &amp; business. It's insufferable

Masks, hans washing &amp; social distancing should be enough. We have more knowledge now &amp; treatments. It's control at this point &amp; too many applaud her 🤷
1328098915720245248 2020-11-16 06:13:51 +0800 <EvaLB5> Please do something to stop Governor from using HHS for her mandates, and it's been 10 months of restrictions; enough. Too many have lost their businesses and income - Michiganders are hurting. With treatment available &amp; vaccines soon, there's no reason for more "NO's"!
1328097205761302528 2020-11-16 06:07:03 +0800 <EvaLB5> She ignores data and goes along with other Democrat Governor to keep us restricted; to include our Holidays. Since Supreme Court ruling, she's been using HHS which is wrong. It's 10 months now &amp; we do not want to live in fear and loss of our businesses - it's wrong!
1328096772946845697 2020-11-16 06:05:20 +0800 <EvaLB5> She has people believe MI Legislature has done nothing, when the opposite is true and she's vetoed everything. She's using HHS to deliver her mandates and never backs it up with current data. Theraputics are readily available &amp; vaccines soon; so why the continued restrictions?
1328095281523650563 2020-11-16 05:59:24 +0800 <EvaLB5> How long will she enforce restrictions using HHS. Why does HHS have unlimited restrictions without @MISenate &amp; MIHouse input? This is obviously the Governor using HHS for her mandates . After 10 months and we're still going despite all the restrictions! Poor businesses.
1328082982456975366 2020-11-16 05:10:32 +0800 <EvaLB5> Same bs pitch for the scam - deny words, spew a spin and repeat consistently 🥴 #DemocratsAreCorrupt

DO YOUR JOB! Stop playing politics NY AG! DISGRACEFUL RHETORIC consistently! Hello AG Barr?
1327927998063005698 2020-11-15 18:54:41 +0800 <EvaLB5> @MrsDriscoll @realDonaldTrump No doubt it's maddening.
1327924378739355648 2020-11-15 18:40:18 +0800 <EvaLB5> @MrsDriscoll @zillaah707 @realDonaldTrump We agree!

1327924088262828032 2020-11-15 18:39:08 +0800 <EvaLB5> Serious issue remains - we no longer have honest media who calls out violence (without bias), and we no longer are protected. Main reason is Dems &amp; their mob condone violence, complicit by hate filled rhetoric etc.. We are trying to be peaceful, but won't tolerate violence
1327923371116556290 2020-11-15 18:36:17 +0800 <EvaLB5> @zillaah707 @MrsDriscoll @realDonaldTrump I saw it as a criticism of the police not protecting MAGA, but allowing the domestic terr-oists to roam freely (overall).
1327923093378109440 2020-11-15 18:35:11 +0800 <EvaLB5> @MrsDriscoll @realDonaldTrump I saw the videos at nighttime. As a large group/crowd, it was verbal. At night, deadly assualts. I didn't feel he was criticizing the proud boys at all.
1327922864083914752 2020-11-15 18:34:17 +0800 <EvaLB5> @MrsDriscoll @realDonaldTrump I read it as during the day the crowd was huge and therefore able to fend off domestic terrorists. Once nightfall, then the assaults happened when MAGA was alone or eating dinner. I read it as a condemnation of DC Mayor &amp; her police force not protecting innocent people
1327919223872610304 2020-11-15 18:19:49 +0800 <EvaLB5> @MrsDriscoll @realDonaldTrump I don't think you read it correctly

Just because I'm ill (without a contagious disease), does NOT mean I should be "mandated" to stay home. Hopefully, this will be resolved soon. Going on 10 months already! Thank you for your input:)
1327229231336722432 2020-11-13 20:38:02 +0800 <EvaLB5> @RealLady_H YES indeed. We can walk away but there are some who enjoy supporting small business, and we can't enter without a mask; wtheck.

1325121144018657280 2020-11-08 01:01:14 +0800 <EvaLB5> They're not PRESIDENT-Elect or VP-elect until States sign off on validation and the Electoral college. Of course you'd jump at what you fought so hard for, but it'll backfire! What a disgrace

1325113327383699458 2020-11-08 00:30:11 +0800 <EvaLB5> Just because CNN and nbc called race for Biden shows they're complicit in steal. Votes aren't done being counted.  Irresponsible as usual. Press doesn't name the President-elect; it's useless except to further doubt &amp; division

1325057710677749761 2020-11-07 20:49:11 +0800 <EvaLB5> I know a little boy who will be 6 in January. He has autism and still does not speak among other things.  What can I get for him for Christmas and his birthday that would be helpful? Anyone have experience with this?
1325057346717028353 2020-11-07 20:47:44 +0800 <EvaLB5> @ilovecrows28 How silly. Yes, here is Michigan also, but few do.  Even so, getting fresh air is vital for sanity!
1325048926123253761 2020-11-07 20:14:16 +0800 <EvaLB5> Those of you able to be at your State/Commonwealth's Capitol, please stay vigilante and let our voices be heard loud and clearly.    I physically am unable to drive 3 hours each way, but will be with you all in spirit &amp; prayer. God's speed to you warriors &amp; patriots.
1325048158896992256 2020-11-07 20:11:13 +0800 <EvaLB5> GO outside today &amp; enjoy Nature &amp; your surroundings. Talk a walk, look up, sit on a bench etc.. Take a rest.  It'll be another nice day here in MI, and I'm going to enjoy it, because winter is surely on her way!
1325046697114955776 2020-11-07 20:05:25 +0800 <EvaLB5> If I understand correctly, machines can't program themselves, or can they? I'm not a tech genius.  Anyways, how can we accept other tight races besides President?   Talib, Peters, Omar ($$$), Maxine etc...
1325046694929719297 2020-11-07 20:05:24 +0800 <EvaLB5> Rephrasing my question:   IF the machines suffered a "glitche" wouldn't it affect all votes (Congress&amp;Senate etc...) on ballots?  Wouldn't their numbers be skewed as well? Or, did the machine "know" it was just choice for President (Trump/Biden), and if so HOW?  Programmed?
1325045525473873921 2020-11-07 20:00:46 +0800 <EvaLB5> @KVenturo Would seem Investigators would check all, not just President.  LOL, I wish I had the power indeed!

1325044752002277376 2020-11-07 19:57:41 +0800 <EvaLB5> And Peters, Omar, and Pressley?
1325044540206669824 2020-11-07 19:56:51 +0800 <EvaLB5> @DonnaWR8 That's the problem: accountability and arrests.
1325044099636977665 2020-11-07 19:55:06 +0800 <EvaLB5> Would the illegal machine &amp; officials also have been responsible for votes received for Talib? I believe so. Worth a check, no? #Michigan
1325043214076813314 2020-11-07 19:51:35 +0800 <EvaLB5> @buzzman888 @JoeBiden Proven liar &amp; corrupt politician. He'll do anything to make Jill 1st Lady - how utterly sad is that.
1325041778794311680 2020-11-07 19:45:52 +0800 <EvaLB5> @carolmswain Each State legislative branch makes the rules, not a random State official. Currently it applies to ALL elections, but I've always believed FEDERAL should be FEDERAL rules! Maybe Congress can change that
1325041334571438080 2020-11-07 19:44:06 +0800 <EvaLB5> @EricTrump bing, bing, bing They truly thought we're stupid!
1325041100650930176 2020-11-07 19:43:11 +0800 <EvaLB5> @m_keenum @Georgerovian I understand totally. Would seem he'd be better at the withdrawal symptoms then. May want to check back with Dr. &amp; bcs as u know, getting upset may be worse than a small cup of coffee, since it elevates bp more IMHO. God's peace to you.
1325039264250343425 2020-11-07 19:35:53 +0800 <EvaLB5> @m_keenum @Georgerovian I also have CHF and a cup of coffee (decaf) is not harmful, according to my cardiologist. Excessive caffeine, yes, is a problem. Just my opinion, but you'd be better off letting him have ONE cup of coffee (decaf has minimal amount of caffeine).

1324120983507263489 2020-11-05 06:46:58 +0800 <EvaLB5> Why wouldn't a corrupt politician not be privy to cheat his way in? He's a proven liar and hasn't accomplished anything in 47 years. What's different now? Socialism agenda &amp; he's their puppet
1324120303354679296 2020-11-05 06:44:15 +0800 <EvaLB5> @ChicalinaT 😶
1324120127701397506 2020-11-05 06:43:34 +0800 <EvaLB5> Amazing how Creepy could get so much more than Crooked
1324116978789961729 2020-11-05 06:31:03 +0800 <EvaLB5> Remember @newsmax is mainly Conservative, but as all media, they have those few. We are learning who they are &amp; we can chose not to watch. That simple. Meanwhile they're overall, much better than @foxnews
1324116587557933056 2020-11-05 06:29:30 +0800 <EvaLB5> @tkmceachin @realDonaldTrump They projected MI yes, but it's far from over because no one, I mean no one finds 120,000 ballots and ALL are for one person; that's impossible. We stand by &amp; ready &amp; holding the line #ProtectTheVote
1324108022680031272 2020-11-05 05:55:28 +0800 <EvaLB5> Now @newsmax calling MI for Biden also  WTH

1324105619884879872 2020-11-05 05:45:55 +0800 <EvaLB5> Something very seriously WRONG
1324105521637527552 2020-11-05 05:45:31 +0800 <EvaLB5> How did Fox give Biden Michigan when Trump was way ahead on SecofState stats 🤔
1324105345648742400 2020-11-05 05:44:49 +0800 <EvaLB5> @KickinBrass1 Sigh
1324105262756712449 2020-11-05 05:44:29 +0800 <EvaLB5> @FoxNews gave MI to Biden
1324101879605973004 2020-11-05 05:31:03 +0800 <EvaLB5> Wtheck Pelosi &amp; Schumer yapping  It's all planned, isn't it!
1324101753445535745 2020-11-05 05:30:33 +0800 <EvaLB5> How do you prove a coup?

1324098594799079425 2020-11-05 05:18:00 +0800 <EvaLB5> @mskixs3 @newsmax Normally, it's Conservative &amp; comments aren't as hateful. Especially 5-6 Chris Salcedo and 7-8 @gregkellyusa are excellent
1324098285418807298 2020-11-05 05:16:46 +0800 <EvaLB5> Oh my how disgusting &amp; insincere  No questions from press  Walks off
1324098116551909379 2020-11-05 05:16:06 +0800 <EvaLB5> He's confident he'll be victorious
1324098028765171714 2020-11-05 05:15:45 +0800 <EvaLB5> "I will govern as an American President" Biden Threatening again, but basically platitudes how he'll care for all!
1324097701336723457 2020-11-05 05:14:27 +0800 <EvaLB5> He's lying as usual 🤭 He's basically saying he's winning! AZ, PA &amp; majority of American people. Unbelievable, he says he has 70 million popular vote 🤔 And few who've beat incumbent President. He's basically claiming victory &amp; preaching platitudes 🤬  People, people please
1324096834072125440 2020-11-05 05:11:00 +0800 <EvaLB5> @la_cates @realDonaldTrump Weird isn't it 🤭
1324096544413491204 2020-11-05 05:09:51 +0800 <EvaLB5> @HLAurora63 @newsmax It's mainly that program. Usually their commentators aren't hateful like those they just had on. The host was over tired I believe, and us an appeaser. Oh well, liking the station doesn't mean every single program 🤔
1324096031886290948 2020-11-05 05:07:49 +0800 <EvaLB5> Michigan SecofState is more hateful tham Whit-nitwit
1324095280418050055 2020-11-05 05:04:50 +0800 <EvaLB5> lol fact checking @DonaldJTrumpJr my goodness 😑
1324094958643589125 2020-11-05 05:03:33 +0800 <EvaLB5> Hope not bcs we don't deserve the Judicial Branch replacing American Citizens votes @senatemajldr @SenateGOP @HouseGOP it's an outrage &amp; we can only blame the Dems &amp; their cheating!
1324094082818445318 2020-11-05 05:00:04 +0800 <EvaLB5> @ChatChristi @newsmax Yes.  I've heard him before as well. He's a typical appeaser, kinda like Bret. Was just surprised at the comments and blatant hatred for Trump. Oh well, other channels exist 🤭
1324093094858469385 2020-11-05 04:56:08 +0800 <EvaLB5> Kinda surprised how negative guests &amp; anchor is in @newsmax now. I've heard different views, but these comments are no different than any other network; especially that Christine person (typical hatful Dem).  Media is media 😑

1324021516498096131 2020-11-05 00:11:43 +0800 <EvaLB5> Good points - why aren't States updating their voting process to 21st Century. There should not be paper ballots @FEC time to update
1324021078340022278 2020-11-05 00:09:58 +0800 <EvaLB5> @gracesmilegive Perhaps. Yet I would hope adults can live their lives without Gov't control. Freedom and liberty matter a lot!
1324020828212727809 2020-11-05 00:08:59 +0800 <EvaLB5> Absolutely @newsmax better than FNC
1324020124710567937 2020-11-05 00:06:11 +0800 <EvaLB5> @g_c313 True. But it's difficult to believe that many as reported nit only hate Trump, but hate our Nation. There's a lot at stake
1324019594965692417 2020-11-05 00:04:05 +0800 <EvaLB5> Justice is for little people; unforgotten in USA. Dems are above the law it appears

1323989739851206659 2020-11-04 22:05:27 +0800 <EvaLB5> Exactly what we asked this morning 🤭
1323989307280003072 2020-11-04 22:03:44 +0800 <EvaLB5> Absolutely
1323987568795504643 2020-11-04 21:56:49 +0800 <EvaLB5> @FCC @AjitPaiFCC why us bigotry/hate speech, racial slurs allowed on the airwaves? Is it bcs it's against our President? We hope nit! We've had enough of this hateful rhetoric spewed by propaganda media
1323984456890331138 2020-11-04 21:44:27 +0800 <EvaLB5> Never, ever followed them anyways
1323984253101760513 2020-11-04 21:43:39 +0800 <EvaLB5> The Michigan SecofState gleefully repeating be MI will take it's sweet time counting votes 😑

1323963300892299267 2020-11-04 20:20:23 +0800 <EvaLB5> @LeterEddie @JakeCorman yup
1323948923170508801 2020-11-04 19:23:15 +0800 <EvaLB5> Call my cynical, but I no longer trust our SCOTUS  I pray I am wrong!
1323943483334381568 2020-11-04 19:01:38 +0800 <EvaLB5> @lpalmquist_lynn @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump It indeed is a plan, or in other words a C O U P
1323938666033651712 2020-11-04 18:42:30 +0800 <EvaLB5> Riddle me this:   I, an American Citizen and Retired Veteran, must vote in person on ELECTION DAY.   But, other unknown persons can cast their ballot days after and no check on postmark or signatures?       Forgive my ignorance, but I do not understand how that can be legal
1323938015778082816 2020-11-04 18:39:55 +0800 <EvaLB5> @SeanCordanon @halfpint1556 AMEN!
1323936586917203974 2020-11-04 18:34:14 +0800 <EvaLB5> It's a mockery to our electoral system!
1323933267314331648 2020-11-04 18:21:03 +0800 <EvaLB5> No surrender! Hold the line  Pray for strength. What seems lost, is always found; always!
1323930959864057862 2020-11-04 18:11:52 +0800 <EvaLB5> @BarryRChapman @NoqReport I made the switch months ago, and yes, @newsmax is great. I no longer watch FNC
1323930525858439169 2020-11-04 18:10:09 +0800 <EvaLB5> @MOPatriot45 I remain hopefully, but I can't stand how they treat our hard working President, and IT MUST STOP&gt;
1323930268453998593 2020-11-04 18:09:08 +0800 <EvaLB5> Our Judicial Branch is compromised   What once was revered, is no longer trusted.   I'm very saddened by that, but we must face reality; too many Judges (and Justice's) are compromised and seem to use emotion/pressure to cast judgment. RETURN to LAW &amp; ORDER!
1323929742035374082 2020-11-04 18:07:02 +0800 <EvaLB5> We've already found that out &amp; CLEARLY
1323929420021833728 2020-11-04 18:05:45 +0800 <EvaLB5> I am angry!
1323929228065341440 2020-11-04 18:05:00 +0800 <EvaLB5> These gangs/mobs that gather must be stopped. They are NOT conducting a peaceful protest.    There are millions of Americans who still love this land and want to remain a Constitutional Republic.
1323928709091545088 2020-11-04 18:02:56 +0800 <EvaLB5> BAM! Exactly!
1323928366475583489 2020-11-04 18:01:34 +0800 <EvaLB5> IF anyone shows up in tactical gear &amp; uniform to "protest" they should be arrested. It's clearly trouble
1323927791927234560 2020-11-04 17:59:17 +0800 <EvaLB5> There is NO justice left in USA. No accountability or consequences for actions that undermine our Constitutional Republic.     I wondered why Pelosi was so smug in her threats; now we know.  BUT, we have power from on high and shall indeed prevail
1323927403241025536 2020-11-04 17:57:44 +0800 <EvaLB5> Got a few hours sleep and I wake up to discover Election Day and States counting our votes have STOPPED .  I decades, I have never witnessed stopping the count. It has always been completed by election night (or early morning of next day, 0100-0300).  This is an outrage!
1323925019106357248 2020-11-04 17:48:16 +0800 <EvaLB5> President is not on trial! He was legit in voicing deep concerns that millions of American Citizens do as well.    The danger is to our Constitution Republic &amp; democratic process we elect our officials. Your rhetoric is a perfect example of the hate &amp; lies spewed daily!
1323835073586700290 2020-11-04 11:50:51 +0800 <EvaLB5> @kimmiintx @newsmax No worries at all
1323834293093883904 2020-11-04 11:47:45 +0800 <EvaLB5> It's an ELECTION  No reason to protest and/or be violent. Why aren't Dems condemning the viol, but rather encouraging it!
1323833926041915392 2020-11-04 11:46:18 +0800 <EvaLB5> @kimmiintx @newsmax Huh? I was replying they called Florida for Trump

1321615986823471108 2020-10-29 08:53:00 +0800 <EvaLB5> Would seem documents disappeared in nyc. If they sent it from there, loaded on truck (driver doesn't go thru mail) &amp; dropped at next point where they discovered empty envelope. It was emptied before it was thrown in truck IMHO

1321263587814449152 2020-10-28 09:32:41 +0800 <EvaLB5> Running for office does not excuse you, or protect you, from indictments &amp; arrests!

1321254696850497541 2020-10-28 08:57:22 +0800 <EvaLB5> Joe &amp; Biden family is compromised &amp; Tony B. Is very concerned.  We are we 🤬
1321253662602219520 2020-10-28 08:53:15 +0800 <EvaLB5> WHOA  Why aren't they arrested?  or a Grand Jury immediately!  Gen Flynn has been persecuted for 4 years &amp; we're learning this piece of the puzzle? Wtheck  More pieces coming together to form a clear picture!
1321252908680306688 2020-10-28 08:50:15 +0800 <EvaLB5> Well, well, well  Could it be Schifff, V-jerkman devised a distraction,or the actual attempt to impeach Trump was to cover this all up🤔
1321251718852726786 2020-10-28 08:45:32 +0800 <EvaLB5> @MajorPatriot @J4Trump2020 And Schiffty broke the straw....with his constant russia hysteria

1321248850573754368 2020-10-28 08:34:08 +0800 <EvaLB5> Slimy Schittt's lies drove him over the edge and he told a rep of Biden family, if Schiff doesn't retract statement, he'd go public. His family was being accused of Treason &amp; he wasn't going to tolerate that. He has facts! He wants the public to decide.

1319619874478587904 2020-10-23 20:41:10 +0800 <EvaLB5> Joe looks so ridiculous in that mask and sunglasses.

1319618381356650497 2020-10-23 20:35:14 +0800 <EvaLB5> Even simple words are too much for some people
1319618236229496833 2020-10-23 20:34:39 +0800 <EvaLB5> And if you have NO positive legacy after years &amp; years...….move on and rest
1319617929579798529 2020-10-23 20:33:26 +0800 <EvaLB5> "you gotta know when to fold 'em"  Too many folks have surpassed their "legacy", and remain on as they decline badly; only to have their "legacy" almost nullified.  Get, retire, when you're legacy is solid; don't stick around &amp; destroy it.  MYHO
1319613630263054339 2020-10-23 20:16:21 +0800 <EvaLB5> @thebruce_robert sounds about right  sadly, there's a lot of ill informed, or uninformed people out there
1319610956314443776 2020-10-23 20:05:43 +0800 <EvaLB5> Trump and Biden give new meaning to - "fight or flight"
1319610232667099137 2020-10-23 20:02:51 +0800 <EvaLB5> Charlie Chaplin was so spot on: "Six best doctors in the world...: 1. The sun, 2. Rest, 3. Exercise, 4. Diet, 5. Self-respect 6. Friends."

1319588974302822402 2020-10-23 18:38:22 +0800 <EvaLB5> The so called media now seems to have "Trump is a liar" as their # 1 mantra. It's highly offensive, since everything Trump says can be proven true. It's obvious too many don't know difference between lies &amp; hyperbole SMH
1319587302562291713 2020-10-23 18:31:44 +0800 <EvaLB5> OH MY GOODNESS  Unbelievable
1319586286714474496 2020-10-23 18:27:42 +0800 <EvaLB5> All I can say this morning is Biden is worse than I thought. I've never liked him (decades) because he is a loud mouth &amp; does nothing. We now know why. He may be more corrupt than Clintons; and that is insufferable.  He builds zero confidence in his ability to LEAD
1319581503475666951 2020-10-23 18:08:41 +0800 <EvaLB5> 🤣

1319468609027084291 2020-10-23 10:40:05 +0800 <EvaLB5> "Decency, respect, honesty"  says biden bcs we haven't had it from "him" meaning Trump. I believe those words will come back as a big old lie from Biden
1319467956577964035 2020-10-23 10:37:30 +0800 <EvaLB5> Glad there's no more debates. It's not helpful &amp; it's sad watching demented joe lash out!

1318246690462273537 2020-10-20 01:44:37 +0800 <EvaLB5> Again, very confusing: Trump website says MT time for RALLIES at 12 and 3 MT. Which means 2 and 5 EDT  Yet many outlets are saying PDT which is incorrect for those 2 cities in AZ 🤔

1318159315598008322 2020-10-19 19:57:25 +0800 <EvaLB5> When we see Harris/Biden sign, we say a quick prayer for the people in that house for an awakening. We right off say: ill informed voters, aka STUPID!  LOL  of course, then we pray for us to not hate SMH
1318158998399574017 2020-10-19 19:56:10 +0800 <EvaLB5> Traveled quite a bit around Michigan within past month, except Eastern part, and there are a lot, a lot, of Trump/Pence signs, and less than 20 total Harris/Biden

1317936362063101952 2020-10-19 05:11:29 +0800 <EvaLB5> @colvinj rightly so; they've spewed enough hatred these past 4 years.

1317920141808644096 2020-10-19 04:07:02 +0800 <EvaLB5> Just got home from being at Lake Michigan And I see Whitmer signaled "8645" I am appalled beyond measure right now; she's crossed a serious line cc @TimMurtaugh @PressSec 7 months of lock downs &amp; restrictions is ENOUGH; that's why they chanted! They didn't wish her death!
1317919102783152128 2020-10-19 04:02:54 +0800 <EvaLB5> @judyannaggie YES!
1317918978010992644 2020-10-19 04:02:24 +0800 <EvaLB5> YES she did. Over President Trump saying to open the State and many chanted "lock her up" because she's hated by more than liked. 7 months of restrictions is enough! President NEVER advocated violence, ever. It's all from the left!
1317917607329173504 2020-10-19 03:56:57 +0800 <EvaLB5> @judyannaggie She IS one of the most disrespectful among the WH Press Corps, so President is correct!
1317917150527524865 2020-10-19 03:55:09 +0800 <EvaLB5> @TrumpWarRoom Her hatred for President @realDonaldTrump has gone beyond anything civil. He said NOTHING about her, except open the State. People chanted because they're tired of her dictator ways, period. Didn't warrant her signaling to kill the President.
1317916511282089988 2020-10-19 03:52:36 +0800 <EvaLB5> @TRUMP45ISMYPRES @GovWhitmer @FBI @SecretService @realDonaldTrump Those of us in the military, or anyone near the military, knows darn well what "86" is and this is inexcusable from the Gov. President @realDonaldTrump said nothing personal about her, just to open up the State - which MANY want, hence the chant. She is beyond anything civil
1317915813525991425 2020-10-19 03:49:50 +0800 <EvaLB5> @LeeChatfield @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Anyone that has been in the military, or around the military, knows exactly what "86" means, and that is plainly wrong. A binary chant is far from signaling "take 'em out". I get Gov. doesn't like him, but this is beyond the pale &amp; unwarranted.
1317914700697473025 2020-10-19 03:45:24 +0800 <EvaLB5> @LeeChatfield President @realDonaldTrump said zero personal about Gov., just to open up the State (as he's done before) &amp; the crowd started the chant. When he replied "lock them all up" he was referencing the corruption he had been speaking about prior. @POTUS does NOT advocate violence EVER

1317633396466647040 2020-10-18 09:07:36 +0800 <EvaLB5> @TreasurySpox @stevenmnuchin1 @SpeakerPelosi Thought @POTUS said to stop negotiations with her 🤔
1317633191692427264 2020-10-18 09:06:47 +0800 <EvaLB5> Whitmer twisting President's words. When he said lock them all up, he was referring to the corruption &amp; not her. He had zero to do with anarchist plotting kidnapping of her. It's all about the election &amp; her blaming Trump for everything. She ruined lives w/her unlawful EO's.
1317617835330457600 2020-10-18 08:05:46 +0800 <EvaLB5> @MomJar1 Agreed She's hurt a lot of families

1317601978755801092 2020-10-18 07:02:46 +0800 <EvaLB5> Packed, large crowd in WI also
1317601080465903617 2020-10-18 06:59:12 +0800 <EvaLB5> Agree with whomever said the crowd should stand and dance as we used to the YMCA with hand motions and all. 😂😂😂
1317600724180664320 2020-10-18 06:57:47 +0800 <EvaLB5> President Trump had nothing to do with the crazy plot by anti-Trumpers to kidnap WHITMER. And she needs to stop the lie and hateful rhetoric to mislead voters; disgraceful remarks by Governor.
1317593445142196225 2020-10-18 06:28:51 +0800 <EvaLB5> Whitmer is such a political hack &amp; hateful person towards GOP &amp; President Trump. She outright lied about her "attackers"; they were extreme ANTI-TRUMP &amp; not alt-right at all. But, she won't say that.

1317447479131066370 2020-10-17 20:48:50 +0800 <EvaLB5> As suspected @COMCAST @XFINITY still scrambling @foxnews channel  Agent sent signal, waited over 20 minutes &amp; it's exactly the same - scrambled and audio skips. It's outrageous that it's ONLY Fox 😡    Why?
1317437952809730050 2020-10-17 20:10:59 +0800 <EvaLB5> well, we'll see what I come up with
1317437854990147584 2020-10-17 20:10:36 +0800 <EvaLB5> comcast is only show in town, except for AT&amp;T which I'll never do business with. Each are horrible. It's terrible because they shouldn't be able to dominate an area; we should have access to other cable networks @FCC  And, it's extremely expensive
1317437475741196288 2020-10-17 20:09:05 +0800 <EvaLB5> still have to pay for wifi and then a few channels we like, but may be time. we lose the convenience of just turning it on, turn to channel and done. Also DVR etc....but I guess on demand may work. I have @Roku , so I'll have to explore more how it works. I can't stand comcast
1317437075667488768 2020-10-17 20:07:30 +0800 <EvaLB5> OK, chat with @comcast and sent a signal to FNC &amp; waiting 20 MINUTES (sheesh).  Dealing with them is not the easiest endeavor. I am seriously contemplating cutting the cable
1317426846091403265 2020-10-17 19:26:51 +0800 <EvaLB5> Seriously @comcast  @Xfinity  why is @FOXNEWS channel still scrambled and unwatchable? It's the 2d day?  Sadly, you're the only show in town, but with the high price, this shouldn't be? We hope you haven't removed that channel! Fix it already!
1317422864044359680 2020-10-17 19:11:01 +0800 <EvaLB5> AS I've said - people will sell their souls for MONEY &amp; power.  NOT ALL, but most!

1317421752964743174 2020-10-17 19:06:37 +0800 <EvaLB5> Sad truth is that people, loose term for WH press corps (not all) &amp; propaganda media, value MONEY &amp; position OVER TRUTH, corruption, and decimating our great NATION.   Thankfully, there are a few who do actual research &amp; show facts; but then attacked viciously.  IT's NOT OK!

1317413733988245504 2020-10-17 18:34:45 +0800 <EvaLB5> @breeadail @saminhim @realDonaldTrump In this hostile environment, that's a brave question.  Civility &amp; respect for the Office of the Presidency has been compromised by propaganda media. I can see no reason for such hateful conduct except MONEY.   It's been 4 years of constant attacks &amp; ALL have proven to be a lie.
1317412513693224964 2020-10-17 18:29:54 +0800 <EvaLB5> After 4 years of constant attacks by media, now they have the nerve to insist a PROVEN release of Biden corruption is labeled false and all the MSM sticks together. What a bunch of propaganda hypocrites
1317412183815475200 2020-10-17 18:28:35 +0800 <EvaLB5> Good morning  Reading "paula" trend and it's unbelievable the comments. Joe attacks a reporter for daring to ask him about reality, and BAM, it's turned around to bash President Trump

1317077024226316288 2020-10-16 20:16:47 +0800 <EvaLB5> It is crystal clear the left/dems have done nothing but obstruct, resist &amp; spread lies 4 years now; it is them that are vile &amp; hate filled causing the unrest in this Country. Of course propaganda media gladly spews talking points &amp; disrespect daily. It's beyond anything civil

1315993557149380609 2020-10-13 20:31:28 +0800 <EvaLB5> @AndrewPollackFL @realDonaldTrump So far....   Next term he may have 1-2 more for SCOTUS
1315991496496214017 2020-10-13 20:23:17 +0800 <EvaLB5> @MarshaBlackburn @senjudiciary Schumer threatened two Justices, nothing happened. He makes threats quite often against GOP, and nothing is done with his vile rhetoric. Equally with Pelosi. It's outrageous to witness, and we the people are tired of it!
1315981882887155715 2020-10-13 19:45:05 +0800 <EvaLB5> IMHO @cspan is the best for Senate Confirmation hearing - uninterrupted, no commentary, and clear picture &amp; audio. They show the proceedings and we watch &amp; listen.   Imagine, we get to think for ourselves 🤦‍♀️
1315980689653870592 2020-10-13 19:40:20 +0800 <EvaLB5> @realDonaldTrump @NBA @FoxNews Yes Sir Many of us are at @OANN @newsmax and @RSBNetwork who cover all your rallies in entirety, no interruptions, AND show the pre-rally Speakers &amp; crowd. It's wonderful.
1315979932846129152 2020-10-13 19:37:20 +0800 <EvaLB5> @kksheld @rac80 @TheDemocrats No Dr., you got it right!  It's a mockery to our election process!
1315979658085761030 2020-10-13 19:36:14 +0800 <EvaLB5> OH Maybe why we don't see #CreepyJoe children 🤔👀
1315975428289503234 2020-10-13 19:19:26 +0800 <EvaLB5> I'll ask again - where is #CreepyJoe children; why don't we see ANY of them - ever?  And seriously, who cares wtheck Jill says - she should be ashamed of herself for condoning the use of her husband who clearly has issues  SMH
1315973646809210881 2020-10-13 19:12:21 +0800 <EvaLB5> @newsmax He's one of the best! We love his show!
1315973484477059074 2020-10-13 19:11:42 +0800 <EvaLB5> @KatrinaPierson Like last time...
1315970566055231489 2020-10-13 19:00:07 +0800 <EvaLB5> @marabutler67 I've been following and do you follow back?
1315970317798576128 2020-10-13 18:59:07 +0800 <EvaLB5> When I was stationed in Korea, we were always amazed how many people would wear masks, especially in Seoul. Especially, the police and soldiers patrolling areas. It was a bit scary.  I don't want USA to become that scene!
1315966245104164864 2020-10-13 18:42:56 +0800 <EvaLB5> @TheBabylonBee @realDonaldTrump 😅😅🤦‍♀️
1315966046524911617 2020-10-13 18:42:09 +0800 <EvaLB5> @GenMhayden What a disgrace for a general officer - it's appalling! Great example, huh  SMH

1315964511120166913 2020-10-13 18:36:03 +0800 <EvaLB5> @realDonaldTrump Haven't watched in over 2 years and refused to watch him; we knew from the get go it would be a disaster of a debate with him moderating - he craves spotlight too much! AN elitist bore he is!
1315963772591394816 2020-10-13 18:33:07 +0800 <EvaLB5> @LeeSmithDC @KarrieFleetwood EXACTLY!
1315963643121537026 2020-10-13 18:32:36 +0800 <EvaLB5> @pnjaban @McAdooGordon Unbelievable bias towards an exceptional nominee. Judge ACB is NOT IN COURT. When she was vetted for 7th Fed District, media didn't obsess about her attire; what changed?  It's 2020 and we have to listen to this biased bs, and from another women - shameful!
1315961972135952384 2020-10-13 18:25:58 +0800 <EvaLB5> Reading comments from MI folks &amp; it's easy to see what's happening. They buy the "Alt-Right" label, cheer the lockdown &amp; zealous restrictions &amp; praise Gov for saving them - yes, saving them. And, we wonder why ALL Dems talk crazy  It's truly heartbreaking what media has done!
1315960473322426369 2020-10-13 18:20:00 +0800 <EvaLB5> @gr8tjude_08 Agreed!   And Lindsey wonders why he's not doing well in SC; he's been nothing but talk, talk, talk. Despite that, we hope SC votes him back in bcs we can't turn it blue.
1315959607601303552 2020-10-13 18:16:34 +0800 <EvaLB5> @RedDragonFly19 @sugamel @realDonaldTrump Truly sad how people have bought the hatred that Dems &amp; their media have spewed; it's truly anti-American
1315959279699066881 2020-10-13 18:15:16 +0800 <EvaLB5> @MSMsDirtyLies Many believed that from the onset... It's the media fear mongering and spreading hysteria that has helped create a worse situation that need be
1315956654748446720 2020-10-13 18:04:50 +0800 <EvaLB5> @DavidJHarrisJr I said that from the beginning - it doesn't add up.
1315955637264801792 2020-10-13 18:00:47 +0800 <EvaLB5> @Twig_76 @prayingmedic @momof3not4 Hopefully, they won't succeed!  By the way, do you follow back? I've been following you &amp; just noticed you're not following. Thanks
1315954845736722432 2020-10-13 17:57:39 +0800 <EvaLB5> @cvpayne What a beautiful tribute and remembrance of the ultimate gift of life and blessings. God bless Sami and her family, and may God continue to bless you, your wife and your family. God is good...

1315832943022047234 2020-10-13 09:53:15 +0800 <EvaLB5> @DJ_Lena @LeeChatfield The question will remain the same as for the Governor's orders; using COVID for 7-8 months us wrong without Legislators involvement. We'll see what happens. Can't keep State so tightly restricted hurting a lot of people's income &amp; lives. No point arguing on here Hagn

1315765988793749504 2020-10-13 05:27:12 +0800 <EvaLB5> @0Heretic3 @LeeChatfield And the AG won't prosecute. I doubt that if Dr. Gordon issues exact same mandates as Gov will fly. Hopefully @MISenate will get on this and open our State up completely!

1315758780878147585 2020-10-13 04:58:33 +0800 <EvaLB5> If Health Dept falls under Executive Branch, wouldn't it follow it's illegal as an order or punishable. It's, at best, guidelines, and Executive Branch must work with Legislative Branch to mandate Michiganders 🤔 @MISenate @MI_Republicans clarification how Dr. Gordon's "orders"
1315757527435444229 2020-10-13 04:53:34 +0800 <EvaLB5> Huge huge rally in FL  Wow
1315756003095392261 2020-10-13 04:47:31 +0800 <EvaLB5> @0Heretic3 @LeeChatfield Thank you.  What I thought, Health Dept can issue guidelines, but it's not law &amp; punishable. Executive Branch must work with Legislative Branch and then it's law. We must open &amp; stop these rules! AG already said she won't prosecute
1315755376181157892 2020-10-13 04:45:01 +0800 <EvaLB5> @DJ_Lena @LeeChatfield Thank you. I wondered about Health Dept, Dr. Gordon orders. However, those are guidelines, not law either. Legislative Branch and Executive Branch must get together.

1315750352701005828 2020-10-13 04:25:04 +0800 <EvaLB5> @LeeChatfield Where can we read ruling? Are we finally free or does Dr Gordon's orders apply?

HHS has zero authority to mandate us either. ENOUGH already. #OPENMichigan and et us get to work! @MIGOP @MIGOPChair we didn't see this from PA Governor?
1313242461045743617 2020-10-06 06:19:36 +0800 <EvaLB5> HHS can offer guidelines, but not mandates or laws that cannot be held up in Court @MISenate @MI_Republicans @MIGOP

Seems illegal to me and tyranny @MI_Republicans @MIGOP  What is going on &amp; is HHS orders don't seem legal?  #OpenMichigan
1313239554116255749 2020-10-06 06:08:03 +0800 <EvaLB5> Michigan is not the outlier in COVID "lockdown" and constant mandates; Pennsylvania gov also was shut down. No one appreciates tyranny. @GovWhitmer  Is she above the law @MIGOP @MIGOPChair @MI_Republicans @MISenate

1312928583476809728 2020-10-05 09:32:21 +0800 <EvaLB5> I've never seen such a whiny bunch of politicians as today's Democrats.
1312927721400471559 2020-10-05 09:28:56 +0800 <EvaLB5> Wrong! Doesn't matter what other agencies say, the issue was she acted in place of working with MI Legislative Branch &amp; her mandates/orders are null now. She's harmed so many people financially, it's shameful. She's an outright liar @MIGOP @MISenate
1312926015019253760 2020-10-05 09:22:09 +0800 <EvaLB5> "protective pool" give it a rest @whca you've done enough damage to press corps integrity,which for most part is zero. @POTUS doesn't answer to you and has @PressSec NOTHING states media has right to unlimited access. You're a disgraceful organization!
1312924603786899457 2020-10-05 09:16:33 +0800 <EvaLB5> Uh huh she thought on CNN she could get away with it and score points; despicable

1312787911973261314 2020-10-05 00:13:23 +0800 <EvaLB5> Impeach Whitmer @MISenate for her abuse of power and harming hundreds of Michiganders financially
1312787449932926977 2020-10-05 00:11:33 +0800 <EvaLB5> FYI @greta "Full Court Press" is on @newsmax and we have our DVR set  Greta gets it!

1312783456401842176 2020-10-04 23:55:41 +0800 <EvaLB5> The @WhiteHouse Chief Dr. Should know how to speak to media! Conley doesn't speak clearly &amp; propaganda media gets excited &amp; spread lies.  @PressSec @MarkMeadows
1312783130416353280 2020-10-04 23:54:23 +0800 <EvaLB5> The media, most, are truly the enermy of the people.   They're incapable of giving news, only political hack talking points 🤬  Useless

1312782246911397890 2020-10-04 23:50:52 +0800 <EvaLB5> When @POTUS is alone, he doesn't need to wear a mask.

1312734699790495744 2020-10-04 20:41:56 +0800 <EvaLB5> We've repeatedly said masks do not protect YOU from ANY virus. It protects others to an extent, but the contant touching, removing and then placing back on face spreads more germs than anything. STOP it already -
1312734196327161859 2020-10-04 20:39:56 +0800 <EvaLB5> @DetmerMike @GovWhitmer THANK YOU.  No one would answer why Whitmer, in her statement, said it's effective for 21 days. I believed it was immediately rescinded. How will businesses stop the mask and COVID announcements incessantly ? WHY are they afraid? #OPENMICHIGAN

1312692434539868162 2020-10-04 17:53:59 +0800 <EvaLB5> Why are businesses and people still REQUIRING masks when the Gov's "orders" have been UNCONSTITUTIONAL?  You want to wear one, do it. BUT don't 'force' me to wear a mask.  STOP it MICHIGAN #OPENMICHIGANNOW
1312689677359607808 2020-10-04 17:43:02 +0800 <EvaLB5> We demand @TeamPelosi get tested for COVID immediately!  As she so often touts: she's 2d in line to the Presidency and Speaker of House.  WE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW! Make it happen Congress M.D. @GOPLeader @SteveScalise

1312349016299130882 2020-10-03 19:09:22 +0800 <EvaLB5> Americans will NEVER allow the continuation of crazy, hate filled, violent Dems takeover of our Country. We will remain a Constitutional Republic &amp; bring back our pride, dignity, and FREEDOM that Dems have stolen for years.  "We're angry &amp; we're not taking it any longer"

Most are all talk - if you believe what you're typing - TURN THEM OFF!
1311978247836631040 2020-10-02 18:36:04 +0800 <EvaLB5> @KelemenCari Yes. My Niece and family have it as well, and it's more than half savings (after adding certain channels).

1311976135685795840 2020-10-02 18:27:40 +0800 <EvaLB5> For me, Chris Wallace would have had more Integrity if indeed he REVIEWED the debate tape, and found the things he missed or could have improved upon.  He clearly states in article, he did not and will not, review the debate tape.   So, there's that!
1311969596790968321 2020-10-02 18:01:41 +0800 <EvaLB5> Should be - during their quarantine, not "during their illness"... since neither show or have symptoms

1311967659550932992 2020-10-02 17:53:59 +0800 <EvaLB5> Boris Johnson came thru "it"; Trump shall as well.
1311966833776488450 2020-10-02 17:50:42 +0800 <EvaLB5> And we present the Foreign Press....   Never showing the entire story as to how this happened, just twisting to show President Trump in bad way...  Almost kinda like election interference at this point SMH
1311966220892155904 2020-10-02 17:48:16 +0800 <EvaLB5> All the places our President has been, and now they test positive? After being around the creep's crew?  Calling me crazy, but that's notable to me.
1311965882797752320 2020-10-02 17:46:56 +0800 <EvaLB5> @NanHayworth @lesmagrittes It's beyond a shadow of the doubt, the propaganda media is largely responsible for the vile hatred we hear every single day. And this harassment of Press Sec was beyond the pale; I don't care who it was who "started it". Elitist crybabies when called out!
1311964419732262913 2020-10-02 17:41:07 +0800 <EvaLB5> Article 25 DOES NOT apply here - he's not "incapacitated" at all. Stay focused  @GOPLeader @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SenTedCruz @Jim_Jordan
1311964071466590211 2020-10-02 17:39:44 +0800 <EvaLB5> One thing for certain: Our President won't cower in the "basement" and tremble with fear!

Better yet, some need a Military Tribunal and GITMO.   Either way Congress is useless with endless Committees, and it's overdue Indictments &amp; Arrests begin.    Enough of the mockery of Justice!

But, I'm still holding out hope there is a sliver of Justice left in our Nation.  Either way, at some point, Justice will be served &amp; accountability becomes alive again.
1311608414938824705 2020-10-01 18:06:29 +0800 <EvaLB5> @DiamondandSilk AT this point, forget about calling them in - present evidence and arrest them, let them fight it out in the Judicial System. Let a JURY decide!  After all, they have been persecuting GEN Flynn 4+ years now 🤬

1311289699001143298 2020-09-30 21:00:01 +0800 <EvaLB5> A voter who is determining who to chose for POTUS, we have a right to know what was Joe wearing; wire, IV and if so, what meds etc..what was on his wrist &amp; the wire?

1311279808375128065 2020-09-30 20:20:43 +0800 <EvaLB5> NON-MEDIA types should Moderate Presidential Debates, and there should be, at a minimum, 3 Moderators and time given to each Nominee to answer in DETAIL ( @ 5 minutes each question). Or, townhall format only.  #Debates2020
1311278330218414080 2020-09-30 20:14:50 +0800 <EvaLB5> Bad day for an appointment with Cardiologist  LOL
1311276493478203392 2020-09-30 20:07:33 +0800 <EvaLB5> I can't stomach Jill, but I noticed last night how she walks; like a woman 10+ years her age.  Who wants a couple that looks half dead running the USA?
1311273034406297600 2020-09-30 19:53:48 +0800 <EvaLB5> "Biden lost because he is lost" - @LLinWood exactly!
1311271224442589185 2020-09-30 19:46:36 +0800 <EvaLB5> Kinda like Judge Sullivan, hummmm 🙃
1311262722370285569 2020-09-30 19:12:49 +0800 <EvaLB5> Trump has never said a word about Beau Biden, not one word.   It's pathetic how old Saint Joe brings it up to deflect away from Jill's son, Hunter.  Where is Hunter?
1311261453152813057 2020-09-30 19:07:47 +0800 <EvaLB5> I missed seeing President's aide remove any papers from his podium after the debate?   I did see Biden aide removed papers from podium?
1311258023399219201 2020-09-30 18:54:09 +0800 <EvaLB5> Millions of us did NOT join FNC, but we were forced to listen to your portion of the debate and your bias against our President. Worst debate moderator I've ever witnessed

1311256401642229761 2020-09-30 18:47:42 +0800 <EvaLB5> Debate format was awful No proper introduction, not enough time for opening statements, too many topics for such a short time frame. Biased Moderator who clearly couldn't steer the debate. Moderator became part of debate and "covered" for Biden.    Never have ONE moderator!
1311255260988669956 2020-09-30 18:43:10 +0800 <EvaLB5> @georgiapeach904 @BarbaraRedgate Sad truth indeed
1311253960125280256 2020-09-30 18:38:00 +0800 <EvaLB5> Should have been countered with: Now yes, but you're running to be President of the USA; How can we know what YOU would do?

1311245420052525058 2020-09-30 18:04:04 +0800 <EvaLB5> Chris Wallace was a complete failure as a moderator.  He had too many topics for a short Debate, and 2 minutes was not enough time to answer questions in detail.   He was rude to @POTUS but helpful to Creepy Joe. It was the worst debate I've ever witnessed
1311244971723419648 2020-09-30 18:02:17 +0800 <EvaLB5> Good Morning

1311136222736199680 2020-09-30 10:50:09 +0800 <EvaLB5> Sadly, I probably will not watch other 2 debates
1311136130000195585 2020-09-30 10:49:47 +0800 <EvaLB5> I still can't say any of Biden's policies are except hatred &amp; medications
1311135280104189953 2020-09-30 10:46:25 +0800 <EvaLB5> Worst debate
1311133633193930752 2020-09-30 10:39:52 +0800 <EvaLB5> I don't remember ever having ballots counted up to 14 days after election day??
1311131640937230336 2020-09-30 10:31:57 +0800 <EvaLB5> ⏬⏬⏬ @FoxNews Chris Wallace was a disaster . Too many other options available!
1311131202552823809 2020-09-30 10:30:12 +0800 <EvaLB5> Biden said he's the leader of the Dem party &amp; he showed it by his attacks &amp; hatred which is indeed today's Dems  #Debates2020
1311130969995436032 2020-09-30 10:29:17 +0800 <EvaLB5> Biden has only attacked  Hate It's the Dems

1311129769803743232 2020-09-30 10:24:31 +0800 <EvaLB5> Biden has notes and a contraption on his left chest he keeps reaching in his coat adjusting
1311128887309594624 2020-09-30 10:21:00 +0800 <EvaLB5> @FoxNews should be embarrassed by Chris Wallace and his blatant disrespect  towards @POTUS and didn't challenge Biden  It's been awful. He let Biden attack &amp; not say what he's going to do! #Debates2020

1311124736429174786 2020-09-30 10:04:31 +0800 <EvaLB5> Wallace isn't a moderator, he's defending Biden and debating Trump
1311122587163004928 2020-09-30 09:55:58 +0800 <EvaLB5> Hope you're happy @FoxNews having a moderator defending Biden
1311122024841043968 2020-09-30 09:53:44 +0800 <EvaLB5> Only attacking Trump, not saying what he'll do to fix things and how. #Debates2020

1305812001063657474 2020-09-15 18:13:36 +0800 <EvaLB5> Call me old fashioned, but I don't view campaigning as a 10-20 minutes speech (irrelevant at that), and then scurrying away. No interaction with "common little people", no crowd of average citizens, only media and a few chosen". Complete mockery condoned by propaganda media!

1305663775538851840 2020-09-15 08:24:36 +0800 <EvaLB5> Few take the time to read BLM's website which clearly states their agenda. Yet, as usual, they conflate BLM with social justice! And social justice sounds so worthy that everyone runs to join in, not realizing they're contributing to the violence &amp; hatred!
1305662722768539648 2020-09-15 08:20:25 +0800 <EvaLB5> "BLM is a marxist organization that wants government overturned"...most who support them haven't a clue @BernardKerik on @TuckerCarlson how very true!  And the wonder why many boo 🤦

1305470623255269376 2020-09-14 19:37:05 +0800 <EvaLB5> Was anyone who attended the rally last night forced to enter the venue?  I saw majority wearing masks. Aren't we told the mask is our protection?  #Hypocrites
1305456948339519493 2020-09-14 18:42:45 +0800 <EvaLB5> The hatred, misinformation, blatant lies from majority under that trend is eye popping  It's all hatred against President Trump and "MAGA idiots".
1305456695062204416 2020-09-14 18:41:44 +0800 <EvaLB5> Saw Lancaster trending and went to check what's up
1305456615685005312 2020-09-14 18:41:26 +0800 <EvaLB5> Good morning
1305310700097671169 2020-09-14 09:01:37 +0800 <EvaLB5> @lizpeek Fact!
1305310547781578752 2020-09-14 09:01:00 +0800 <EvaLB5> @BlueStarMomDT @RSBNetwork I don't, I'll watch at 10 ☺️ I just switched to watch @masterpiecepbs and I always DVR it, so I'll finish it tomorrow.
1305310193367027712 2020-09-14 08:59:36 +0800 <EvaLB5> Switched to @PBS to watch "Van der Call" on @masterpiecepbs until rally begins &amp; tape rest if show 🤨
1305309512841261057 2020-09-14 08:56:53 +0800 <EvaLB5> @Metal_Heath You sound like a nice lefty Bye-bye
1305309300424937473 2020-09-14 08:56:03 +0800 <EvaLB5> @BlueStarMomDT @RSBNetwork They can't air the music bcs of yourube  copyright laws except they do play "God Bless the USA when Trump comes out.   They gave the speakers too early because now it's just the reporters speaking now until it begins (unless a surprise happens). Oh well
1305305314821111808 2020-09-14 08:40:13 +0800 <EvaLB5> @StoneZoda @cspan @RSBNetwork lol It's tough being neurotic 😂😂😂

1305301786920652801 2020-09-14 08:26:11 +0800 <EvaLB5> Trolls out in full force
1305300949272072193 2020-09-14 08:22:52 +0800 <EvaLB5> @StoneZoda @cspan We can always felt on @RSBNetwork who are already there and they also said, as did Trump website, rally is at 10 eastern, 7 pacific time
1305300647085047808 2020-09-14 08:21:40 +0800 <EvaLB5> @StoneZoda I watched it also and they clearly said that at 9:35 they're reshowing Latino Roundtable. Again, rally in LV starts at 10 eastern time  But hopefully, at 10 they'll show it. But @cspan hasn't shown or said it yet
1305300102194573313 2020-09-14 08:19:30 +0800 <EvaLB5> @AlorelaiA @rrw315 @lizpeek Cover? Lol, they're facts as per COVID team &amp; live video. And of course, good little leftist like you, you name call &amp; use hatred. That's all you got!  Wake up!
1305298228145983488 2020-09-14 08:12:03 +0800 <EvaLB5> @rrw315 @lizpeek You're the one who believes lies, nit me. I watched daily COVID team briefings and just an FYI: President Trump called out#JumbledBiden lies, nit blame. Lastly, Governors determine their States mandates, not President. Try &amp; stay awake. Bye-bye
1305296645404397571 2020-09-14 08:05:46 +0800 <EvaLB5> @StoneZoda No, they're showing the earlier Latino Roundtable. No mention of rally. But, hey they might. Rally starts at 10 EDT
1305295518365560833 2020-09-14 08:01:17 +0800 <EvaLB5> 9:35 @cspan showing repeat of Latino Roundtable President Trump had earlier today
1305293801502789632 2020-09-14 07:54:28 +0800 <EvaLB5> I don't see Trump rally on schedule tonight @cspan guess weekends, late night is not good?
1305289595354058753 2020-09-14 07:37:45 +0800 <EvaLB5> @lizpeek Don't know who he is, but his ignorance is stunning 🥴

1305133254626942976 2020-09-13 21:16:30 +0800 <EvaLB5> The @NFL @nflcommish support and encourage violence. And we're suppose to cheer for them and celebrate and be proud football is BACK?  I don't think so. It's outrageous that politics have overtaken the field of play and especially one that engages in violence &amp; hatred!

1305092180021829632 2020-09-13 18:33:17 +0800 <EvaLB5> Seriously  if a mask works and is so vital, why do you need "social distancing" , and vice versa 🤔
1305091719898304513 2020-09-13 18:31:28 +0800 <EvaLB5> Why do you need a teleprompter or notes to speak about YOUR OWN thoughts, decisions, views, or stand on a topic - that's troubling if you cannot articulate your own thoughts
1305090663915098112 2020-09-13 18:27:16 +0800 <EvaLB5> The Senate is wouldn't be required to general election because the Majority Leader is NOT so close to possibly sliding into the Presidency!
1305090662296170496 2020-09-13 18:27:15 +0800 <EvaLB5> It is not "democracy" to have someone like Pelosi ever again who dictates how OUR House and even OUR Country is handled. Her ineptitude is only surpassed by her hubris!  #NeverAgain
1305090660698124288 2020-09-13 18:27:15 +0800 <EvaLB5> After general election, have  HofR majority select 2-4 people and place a special ballot for ALL American Citizens to vote within one month later. By Mid-December, everyone would know who THE PEOPLE selected as Speaker of OUR House
1305090658949115904 2020-09-13 18:27:15 +0800 <EvaLB5> Judging by Pelosi's behavior, I feel we should have a public vote on who becomes Speaker of OUR House.  That one party, or one district, can determine who is 2d in line for POTUS is abhorrent!
1305088924755398657 2020-09-13 18:20:21 +0800 <EvaLB5> Nothing gives you the right to try and kill anyone.

1304758717624262659 2020-09-12 20:28:14 +0800 <EvaLB5> President @realDonaldTrump gave AG Barr the authority to declassify ALL documents marked "classified".    Did I miss seeing any yet?

1304546586983313410 2020-09-12 06:25:18 +0800 <EvaLB5> It's sad that MAJ PAYNE is trending when it clearly states SGT MAJOR PAYNE.... I'm not sure why Twitter does that but it makes a big difference in identifying SGM Payne  Also, some outlets can't bother identifying him correctly, it's plain disrespect

1302963386943143936 2020-09-07 21:34:13 +0800 <EvaLB5> Word for today: LIBERTY - "the state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one's way of life, behavior, or political views."  It does NOT mean you can infringe on anyone else’s right to live their life, peaceful, and abide by laws.

1302226946017972224 2020-09-05 20:47:52 +0800 <EvaLB5> @HoneyWest25 @FoxNews Remember when Jan got upset because President Trump marked a weather map, and her vile tweets against him; yeah that! It's incredulous hypocrisy!
1302225148431478784 2020-09-05 20:40:44 +0800 <EvaLB5> And us little people are at the bottom of the tier of Justice; we're immediately punished with no serious recourse. Best example is GEN Flynn's case - it's reprehensible!
1302224723481329664 2020-09-05 20:39:02 +0800 <EvaLB5> Four years and NO accountability, no arrests, no responsibility and no justice.  Difficult to believe there isn't a rigged, three tier justice system
1302223310563028992 2020-09-05 20:33:26 +0800 <EvaLB5> @MrVeritas Exactly. And President Trump made that clear.
1302222957956263937 2020-09-05 20:32:01 +0800 <EvaLB5> That's a good question many are asking:   why didn't the Atlantic hit piece come out right after "it" happened? 🥴

1302212331758333953 2020-09-05 19:49:48 +0800 <EvaLB5> @MrVeritas I remember President telling the story how the weather so bad they couldn't get to other place to honor our fallen. He said, he even asked them to DRIVE there (which quite lengthy), but Security wouldn't approve. Actions speak louder than words, and no one has done more for us

1301897381223395329 2020-09-04 22:58:18 +0800 <EvaLB5> @muzicmaniack @JHoganGidley @AmericaFirstPAC Because he's the President. Check facts not gossip
1301894886418010112 2020-09-04 22:48:23 +0800 <EvaLB5> @dlnarch So true!
1301890588204294146 2020-09-04 22:31:18 +0800 <EvaLB5> Whew, a lot of vile people this morning. Must have been triggered by something that happened
1301869102219358208 2020-09-04 21:05:56 +0800 <EvaLB5> @LLinWood @logback Amen 🙏🙏
1301859993243848704 2020-09-04 20:29:44 +0800 <EvaLB5> "Do I look rattled"?
1301850093369413632 2020-09-04 19:50:24 +0800 <EvaLB5> @_Duckman_ @JHoganGidley @AmericaFirstPAC Gosh, you're a moron. Bye-bye
1301849941678198785 2020-09-04 19:49:47 +0800 <EvaLB5> 5 Civic duties - "Civic responsibilities include paying taxes, voting, registering for military service, serving on a jury &amp; obeying the law. The power of the USA government comes from the people, so it is important for people to understand their civic duties &amp; responsibilities."
1301849438923755521 2020-09-04 19:47:48 +0800 <EvaLB5> Another word you may want to learn -    CIVICS - the study of the rights and duties of citizens and of how government works
1301847910271856641 2020-09-04 19:41:43 +0800 <EvaLB5> @Doodisgirl 👏👏
1301847636299972608 2020-09-04 19:40:38 +0800 <EvaLB5> @DrEtiquette Beyond a shadow of doubt, YES!
1301847336017158144 2020-09-04 19:39:26 +0800 <EvaLB5> I have put the energy out to receive 100K in very near future  Of course, I'll wait 👀💐
1301846947691667457 2020-09-04 19:37:54 +0800 <EvaLB5> Sources believe something BIGLY will happen today that will rock the Nation 🤔
1301846685409259528 2020-09-04 19:36:51 +0800 <EvaLB5> Of course that doesn't apply to their single digit followers  SMH
1301846455964106753 2020-09-04 19:35:56 +0800 <EvaLB5> Usually I don't block but when vile or name calling (ugly) then there's no writing with you, so bye bye.
1301845394444431368 2020-09-04 19:31:43 +0800 <EvaLB5> Please learn this word and understand when &amp; how it's used, thank you.                    HYPERBOLE - NOUN: "exaggerated statements or claims not meant to be taken literally."
1301844716288344065 2020-09-04 19:29:02 +0800 <EvaLB5> It was not the tweet, it was the interview  Amazing how that works - SMH
1301842903434760194 2020-09-04 19:21:49 +0800 <EvaLB5> These "sources" aka Generals, should be ashamed of themselves if acknowledgments are true.

1301819785127309313 2020-09-04 17:49:58 +0800 <EvaLB5> wonder why #chokermitt is in the R party; acts like a D.
1301817864387809280 2020-09-04 17:42:20 +0800 <EvaLB5> It was the interview, not the tweet
1301813878402277377 2020-09-04 17:26:29 +0800 <EvaLB5> Oh, I forgot:  Good Morning 😅
1301813752199811073 2020-09-04 17:25:59 +0800 <EvaLB5> I instantly block haters &amp; uninformed for 2 reason: they're vile and after 1st tweet "zillions" follow. It's sad to watch but it will only get worse.  Most fall for whatever they hear on CNN, MSNBC or their buddies in print. Few think on their own.
1301812228035956736 2020-09-04 17:19:56 +0800 <EvaLB5> Our President has been outright honest, even at personal expense, with how he feels.   We clearly are  aware &amp; his actions speak louder than his tweets!
1301811847721615361 2020-09-04 17:18:25 +0800 <EvaLB5> IMHO the intensified hatred &amp; violence is spread by the #DisaesedMedia in this Country and their counterparts, social media.   It's reprehensible what's going on and blatant election interference led by Obama's, Clinton's and their ilk, IMHO.
1301811352953122816 2020-09-04 17:16:27 +0800 <EvaLB5> Of course the killing of suspected murderer is caused by Trump's tweet (SMH).  It couldn't be because of his open interview on Vice News, oh no, that couldn't be.  Law Enforcement is not stupid and the US Marshalls are beyond reproach in their duties.
1301808575904387072 2020-09-04 17:05:25 +0800 <EvaLB5> Wake up to a flood of anger and lies. The media, this time led by The Atlantic, is actively engaged in election interference and spreading vicious lies based on Trump's open dislike for John McCain and John Kelly ; they are separate issues.
1301684111992598529 2020-09-04 08:50:51 +0800 <EvaLB5> Until tomorrow God willing 🙏 Stay safe and don't waste energy on hate 🙂
1301683499699769344 2020-09-04 08:48:25 +0800 <EvaLB5> @BlueStarMomDT Uplifting counts

1301652049952735234 2020-09-04 06:43:26 +0800 <EvaLB5> How people twist things to make them sound vicious is beyond reprehensible.

1301648079221858304 2020-09-04 06:27:40 +0800 <EvaLB5> Be careful Virginia voters....read all mail carefully as fake group sending out fake voter forms. And surprisingly they have all your info on the forms🤬 Call voting officials if you're needing assistance.  Vote in person if possible!

1301631832337911816 2020-09-04 05:23:06 +0800 <EvaLB5> @Lakecrazy @VP Oh absolutely, political left. I was Ordained UCC &amp; they've become unhinged left. I'm glad I'm retired.  I was just saying back in the day, they cared &amp; helped many without ulterior motives &amp; agendas.  And they wonder why so many left church 🥴
1301629778429120512 2020-09-04 05:14:56 +0800 <EvaLB5> @Lakecrazy @VP They definitely do now &amp; changed into a political arm, sadly.   But, in fairness, they helped my family in 1956  as we escaped Hungary &amp; Communism.
