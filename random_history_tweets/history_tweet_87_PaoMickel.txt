1343797344232501248 2020-12-29 13:53:48 +0800 <PaoMickel> Any dreams had of being President have evaporated with his 🤡 worship.
1343760390623121408 2020-12-29 11:26:57 +0800 <PaoMickel> Hi everyone, I am unable to follow anyone for 3 days.  Am guessing this is what’s called Twitmo! If you do follow me hang in there I will follow you as soon as I can. 👍😷  https://t.co/4KqlQyBGPD
1343756966779265024 2020-12-29 11:13:21 +0800 <PaoMickel> Drop pure vinegar and salt, that should do the trick. Bonus is that the grass won’t grow for a loooooong time!😂😂😂😂😂
1343680530164850688 2020-12-29 06:09:37 +0800 <PaoMickel> Go Amy. Holidays can be depressing for those who are not recovering so you should be super proud of yourself. Your followers are here for you. 💕😷

1343375661080068097 2020-12-28 09:58:10 +0800 <PaoMickel> Should save his energy and money he has cooked his goose over the last year while at the same time quoting verses from the Bible. He is a ball less hypocrite.
1343374198270398464 2020-12-28 09:52:22 +0800 <PaoMickel> Been following a Joe since he declared he was running, throughout the primary’s and have followed Kamala since she was chosen as VP. Cannot wait for Jan 20th 2021. Must win Georgia.  https://t.co/EuONM7Qqlg
1343373227175755776 2020-12-28 09:48:30 +0800 <PaoMickel> Applaud hi. For what he should have done days ago. Hell no. He probably blackmailed them.
1343360856315154432 2020-12-28 08:59:21 +0800 <PaoMickel> GOP have failed their party and America. Shame on them.

1343030494678507526 2020-12-27 11:06:36 +0800 <PaoMickel> Yes, he’s a coward.

1342992988473937920 2020-12-27 08:37:34 +0800 <PaoMickel> Thanks for including me on your list Jay.🙏🏻😷
1342941568324390912 2020-12-27 05:13:15 +0800 <PaoMickel> Trump is playing a political game. The $2000 is a gag so when he is no longer POTUS he will say he tried to get $2000 and Congress rejected it. WHe knows he could have spoken up earlier but deliberately chose not to so he can look like a defeated hero. Con man always in action.
1342897582922551296 2020-12-27 02:18:28 +0800 <PaoMickel> Thanks Nathalie. Stuck on list 3 did all the others and will finish one at a time when I am allowed. Would 💙 to be on one of your lists.                              Go Warnock and Ossoff.

1342700645606780929 2020-12-26 13:15:54 +0800 <PaoMickel> No kidding.🤨
1342699485470703616 2020-12-26 13:11:18 +0800 <PaoMickel> Mind blowing. Anyone that thinks this is acceptable police behaviour have their heads in the sand. This is abuse of power and police brutality.
1342477795528638464 2020-12-25 22:30:23 +0800 <PaoMickel> This is a tough year emotionally and financially and time for us to reach out to those in need of solace.🙏🏻  https://t.co/HwS1N0Gw3c

1342265323874000896 2020-12-25 08:26:05 +0800 <PaoMickel> Thanks Jay. Followed all new and retweeted. Go Georgia.
1342175282824794112 2020-12-25 02:28:18 +0800 <PaoMickel> Makes me want to get on a flight right now and visit my birthplace. 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
1342172732088184832 2020-12-25 02:18:10 +0800 <PaoMickel> He learned from the 🤡

1342001527049732096 2020-12-24 14:57:51 +0800 <PaoMickel> Thanks for the list Dave and love the double spacing. Makes it a lot easier for my fingers and 👀. Have followed all new to me and retweeted.
1341999322901069824 2020-12-24 14:49:06 +0800 <PaoMickel> but you can conspire against the USA and get a pardon. Kill innocent people and get a pardon and the list goes on. POTUS powers of pardon need to be changed.
1341998411097128961 2020-12-24 14:45:28 +0800 <PaoMickel> A 4 years of stress and misery a bit of humour cannot come soon enough.
1341991614609178624 2020-12-24 14:18:28 +0800 <PaoMickel> A recycled tablecloth.
1341983606336409600 2020-12-24 13:46:39 +0800 <PaoMickel> Warlock and Ossoff. Go Blue Georgia
1341820511530016769 2020-12-24 02:58:34 +0800 <PaoMickel> Stimulus money should go to stimulating the buying power and survival of Americans hit hard economically by coronavirus. The other fluff insisted on by the GOP and used as a bargaining chip is icing on the cake for the wealthy and elected representatives. It’s a disgrace.
1341806307913842688 2020-12-24 02:02:08 +0800 <PaoMickel> Call me crazy, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the whole trump/ stimulus/McConnell/ conflict is a charade so trump looks like Santa!  https://t.co/tNWFXPA4U1

1341570407405551620 2020-12-23 10:24:44 +0800 <PaoMickel> Another awesome list Grandpa. And a big thank you for including me on your list. Go Georgia,😷
1341564850145644544 2020-12-23 10:02:40 +0800 <PaoMickel> Probably looking for a hiding place right about now!
1341564545773420545 2020-12-23 10:01:27 +0800 <PaoMickel> Won’t be a minute too soon. She made a big mistake carrying trumps water.
1341563968934932480 2020-12-23 09:59:09 +0800 <PaoMickel> Looks to me as if he is planning to establish a personal militia. Hope I am wrong.
1341553369719062529 2020-12-23 09:17:02 +0800 <PaoMickel> and the alternative is O’Toole? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1341550129338175488 2020-12-23 09:04:10 +0800 <PaoMickel> Hope it doesn’t drag you down and you can enjoy a peaceful Christmas. Stay safe. 😷
1341547272379613186 2020-12-23 08:52:49 +0800 <PaoMickel> They have no morals, despicable people who only care about themselves.
1341482739942342656 2020-12-23 04:36:23 +0800 <PaoMickel> Awesome.💙🙏🏻😷

1341237523775774720 2020-12-22 12:21:59 +0800 <PaoMickel> OMG keep us updated on his condition. One of the early signs of covid was conjunctivitis, wonder if this is what it can potentially develop into. Praying for a full recovery for your Brother.
1341235665703292930 2020-12-22 12:14:36 +0800 <PaoMickel> 2 want to rip some faces off!
1341233279328894977 2020-12-22 12:05:07 +0800 <PaoMickel> He’s right.
1341232949899927553 2020-12-22 12:03:48 +0800 <PaoMickel> Watching a 3rd World Country vote on a national disgrace relief package. The rich get richer on the backs of the middle class and the poor. Shameful.
1341232337980334080 2020-12-22 12:01:22 +0800 <PaoMickel> Better reschedule to January 20th and yes I a definately going to celebrate, bigly. 🥳🥂
1341229996405231618 2020-12-22 11:52:04 +0800 <PaoMickel> Pigs at the trough.🐷

1341080411120627714 2020-12-22 01:57:40 +0800 <PaoMickel> No point, they are too stupid to understand.

1340706831102971904 2020-12-21 01:13:12 +0800 <PaoMickel> Question is why, what’s in it for him?
1340706123897131008 2020-12-21 01:10:23 +0800 <PaoMickel> How on earth was he re-elected.
1340481051789934592 2020-12-20 10:16:02 +0800 <PaoMickel> They have no shame.
1340471555109781504 2020-12-20 09:38:18 +0800 <PaoMickel> “Only the best people!”
1340350904277450753 2020-12-20 01:38:52 +0800 <PaoMickel> Caught up with a few more lists. Thanks Curley. Have followed all new to me.  https://t.co/OIOCjDLm3l
1340187716172959746 2020-12-19 14:50:25 +0800 <PaoMickel> They don’t think, that’s the problem. Neither do they care. I am all right Jack is their motto and screw everyone else.
1340187303587639296 2020-12-19 14:48:47 +0800 <PaoMickel> Yes, anything to save his own skin. He is also genetically pre disposed to being an a—h—-!
1340185170352033795 2020-12-19 14:40:18 +0800 <PaoMickel> He is a Russian asset and therefor a traitor.
1340173128568205315 2020-12-19 13:52:27 +0800 <PaoMickel> You are very brave to speak up a will give others strength. 🙏🏻

1340133117600751617 2020-12-19 11:13:28 +0800 <PaoMickel> A national embarrassment with unimaginable consequences for millions of Americans trying to hang on. To add to the misery, a healthcare system that works for 1% . The other 99% an illness away from potential bankruptcy in what was the richest most powerful country in the world.
1340050198467244032 2020-12-19 05:43:58 +0800 <PaoMickel> This is a blatant attack on what should be a recovery of the economy in favour of bringing America and its residents to total collapse. What kind of elected representatives undermine the government that they took an oath to protect? SCUM
1339987835525292032 2020-12-19 01:36:10 +0800 <PaoMickel> The law thinks they are above the law. Appalling and hope charges are forthcoming.
1339899571619549186 2020-12-18 19:45:26 +0800 <PaoMickel> Interesting  How these 'sinks' regulate the climate  https://t.co/Fz2pt2iPWX
1339834281372254208 2020-12-18 15:26:00 +0800 <PaoMickel> Problem for them is what country would take them?😂😂😂😂😂no one wants their country to be populated with misogynists, racists and homophobes.
1339831767813931008 2020-12-18 15:16:00 +0800 <PaoMickel> A must listen.
1339825494120779788 2020-12-18 14:51:05 +0800 <PaoMickel> She had a good life with you, was blessed being your companion just as you were blessed being hers. 🙏🏻
1339823044823412738 2020-12-18 14:41:21 +0800 <PaoMickel> Excellent!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1339821743679008768 2020-12-18 14:36:11 +0800 <PaoMickel> OMG they must all be very afraid of what is likely to happen post Jan 2021.
1339820922417545216 2020-12-18 14:32:55 +0800 <PaoMickel> Absolutely.
1339771684170027008 2020-12-18 11:17:15 +0800 <PaoMickel> Sounds like he made an accurate description of Republicans in Congress you included. You’re are a Bible punching hypocrite.

1339758103676391425 2020-12-18 10:23:18 +0800 <PaoMickel> You area sad little man trying to be the “big” guy defending trumps nonsense. History will not be kind to you and your co conspirators. Shame on you.

1339623118021697536 2020-12-18 01:26:54 +0800 <PaoMickel> This is crazy, who on earth came up with the brainless idea of a lottery. The frontline workers must be first and whoever is responsible for the decision should be fired.
1339534903403114496 2020-12-17 19:36:22 +0800 <PaoMickel> Good job on all the lists Hennessy. Found some new to me resisters and retweeted all lists. Hope you are well soon and back to full steam ahead for Georgia. 🎄😷

1339429604667269122 2020-12-17 12:37:57 +0800 <PaoMickel> Azar is a criminal snd should be charged and prosecuted for causing thousands of unnecessary deaths.

1339274613419720704 2020-12-17 02:22:05 +0800 <PaoMickel> Back very carefully. 😂
1339273395960074240 2020-12-17 02:17:14 +0800 <PaoMickel> I am in awe of how someone like Ron Johnson was ever elected. 2022 can’t come soon enough.
1339273091197718528 2020-12-17 02:16:02 +0800 <PaoMickel> No doubt a “dear leader” pat me on the back election 2024 visual!
1339112209985617920 2020-12-16 15:36:45 +0800 <PaoMickel> He’s going to need a lot more than blessings to get him through the next 6 chapter of his life.😂😂😂😂
1339073448413294593 2020-12-16 13:02:43 +0800 <PaoMickel> Excellent choice.
1339029396988948481 2020-12-16 10:07:40 +0800 <PaoMickel> If laws were broken yes he should be prosecuted. No one should be above the law.
1339027041853718528 2020-12-16 09:58:19 +0800 <PaoMickel> ✋
1339026358064705536 2020-12-16 09:55:36 +0800 <PaoMickel> Not a big Tom Cruise fan but give him big kudos for calling it like it is, saying what needs to be said and looking out for his workers. Holding those who are irresponsible to account is what we need to battle the monster virus. 👏🙏🏻
1338974900740976641 2020-12-16 06:31:07 +0800 <PaoMickel> What an idiot. Guess he figures God will protect him!
1338902585927847936 2020-12-16 01:43:46 +0800 <PaoMickel> When will they learn trump is only interested in himself. His presidency is over, that con is finished so now he is moving into the next con and needs money. Sadly there are millions of fools out there willing to line his pockets.
1338670341627887616 2020-12-15 10:20:55 +0800 <PaoMickel> Like the sound of inmate Loeffler.

1338663596398501890 2020-12-15 09:54:07 +0800 <PaoMickel> You are absolutely right. These morons are “all about me” people. Funny how these anti mask anti science GOP swamp scum suddenly changed their tune to save themselves.

1338341191083913217 2020-12-14 12:32:59 +0800 <PaoMickel> I’d say he has overindulged in something! Would love a close up of his nose.
1338336079212998660 2020-12-14 12:12:41 +0800 <PaoMickel> The only staff in the White House to be vaccinated should be the Domestic staff. No political staff should be vaccinated, that would be a slap in the face to all the families who have lost loved ones. Any house staff working anywhere near trump and his spawn should be in full PPE
1338333557513617408 2020-12-14 12:02:39 +0800 <PaoMickel> Was disgusted by this piece in the WSJ. This had better not be the beginning of years of journalists looking to nit pick Dems. After the last 4 years of GOP mayhem it’s time to heal and get on with the business of governing. To Dr. Jill, January 20th cannot come soon enough.
1338302176788054019 2020-12-14 09:57:58 +0800 <PaoMickel> I agree.

Makes me sick. trump has wakened a violent racist segment of the American population and has at no time condemned their behavior. As usual the Dems will have to clean up all the ugly messes.

1337808737730318336 2020-12-13 01:17:13 +0800 <PaoMickel> what about the peculiar wins in Kentucky and SC. Those States should be investigated for voter fraud.

1337518279292715008 2020-12-12 06:03:02 +0800 <PaoMickel> @IvankaTrump you can run but you can’t hide. Residing in a secure private enclave in Florida will not erase the damage you and your family have done to America. Running for office in the future? Save your time, you history will make you the second biggest loser after your father.
1337455215428026368 2020-12-12 01:52:26 +0800 <PaoMickel> Yes very angry and massively disappointed.
1337449293670621186 2020-12-12 01:28:54 +0800 <PaoMickel> Thanks for the lists Alexa. Always find new interesting people to follow. Followed and retweeted. 🙏🏻😷
1337445344670404609 2020-12-12 01:13:13 +0800 <PaoMickel> I agree. Biden is a good man but he is certainly not stupid.
1337298074952060929 2020-12-11 15:28:01 +0800 <PaoMickel> Not surprised, they are all brainwashed crazed trumpers.
1337297618716672000 2020-12-11 15:26:12 +0800 <PaoMickel> 👏👏👏👏👏
1337256313726795776 2020-12-11 12:42:04 +0800 <PaoMickel> You do know Biden won the 2020 election that trump is the worst POTUS in the history of the US and that he will be held to account for the crimes he has committed? Most notable the avoidable deaths of almost 300,000 Americans. trump virus is spreading, looks like you caught it.
1337245729119584256 2020-12-11 12:00:01 +0800 <PaoMickel> Wish we would sue to overturn Kentucky and SC.
1337231553286402048 2020-12-11 11:03:41 +0800 <PaoMickel> What a joke this pot stirring trump ass kisser I want a pardon covidiot he is!
1337216673149898752 2020-12-11 10:04:33 +0800 <PaoMickel> Guess the GOP can’t grasp the concept that they picked an all  time loser. Only thing trump won in his life was 2016 and that was stolen with the help of Putin. Did Putin guarantee Mitch and Lady G a win in 2020? Investigate Kentucky and SC.
1337214181943115777 2020-12-11 09:54:39 +0800 <PaoMickel> This list of 106 elected GOP representatives will go down in history as  attempting to seize control of the Government and then install a Dictator. Such is their desperation to protect themselves against possible legal charges, keep their positions and worship the orange 🤡.

1336883653721276416 2020-12-10 12:01:15 +0800 <PaoMickel> So now trump is going to complete the re branding of the Republican Party which is now dead. Only loyalists will be allowed in.

1334020742971682819 2020-12-02 14:25:04 +0800 <PaoMickel> Goodness gracious. A man with the balls to call it like it is.👏👏👏👏👏
1334020024969826304 2020-12-02 14:22:13 +0800 <PaoMickel> She is an ignorant ass. She should check out how Scotland develops the minds of their youth. Yes free University if you are Scottish. Your success is not based on your social background but based on your brain! What a concept!
1333984131286331393 2020-12-02 11:59:35 +0800 <PaoMickel> @JohnCornyn  once thought you were a reasonable man. Now I can see clearly and realize that you are a hypocrite and an opportunist. No different all the other GOG lapdogs.
1333980519827030016 2020-12-02 11:45:14 +0800 <PaoMickel> Hi followers, if you use disposable masks, please cut off the ear elastics before throwing them in the garbage. Don’t want to see any of our creatures strangled by a mask. 🙏🏻Please pads it on.
1333978819888234497 2020-12-02 11:38:29 +0800 <PaoMickel> Love this video. Rescues are the best pets ever. 💕💕💕💕💕
1333929106618994688 2020-12-02 08:20:56 +0800 <PaoMickel> Just like the whiners complaining about Neena Tanden and her tweets. Rules for GOP and other rules for everyone else.
1333927962563944448 2020-12-02 08:16:24 +0800 <PaoMickel> Looks like I will too!
1333848277674979328 2020-12-02 02:59:45 +0800 <PaoMickel> 100% agree.
1333847107371876353 2020-12-02 02:55:06 +0800 <PaoMickel> Time for her to move to FOX News. We can see clearly now that she too is a Libertarian Republican!
1333845680763203584 2020-12-02 02:49:26 +0800 <PaoMickel> Completely agree. Not a fan and recall her making many eye popping statements.
1333843281944268800 2020-12-02 02:39:54 +0800 <PaoMickel> Says everything about Sabatini. He most definitely should not hold elected office.
1333636939447091207 2020-12-01 12:59:58 +0800 <PaoMickel> Yes.
1333627547477704705 2020-12-01 12:22:39 +0800 <PaoMickel> If there was a State that should be investigated for voter fraud, it’s Kentucky.

1333383109505478659 2020-11-30 20:11:21 +0800 <PaoMickel> Completely nuts, talking a load of rubbish. Anyone can stand up and spout and gesticulate. Poor souls who follow her are equally as stupid. No doubt throwing lots of money at her in the hope they will be “saved”!
1333369128208400385 2020-11-30 19:15:47 +0800 <PaoMickel> Yes
1333368455886635013 2020-11-30 19:13:07 +0800 <PaoMickel> Don’t care how Birx tries to justify her behaviour, she failed at every turn to help those she was supposed to provide with correct scientific information. Instead she drank the Kool Aid.
1333364423017152512 2020-11-30 18:57:05 +0800 <PaoMickel> Sounds trumpish!

1333188619893305344 2020-11-30 07:18:31 +0800 <PaoMickel> Awe. Beautiful pup. 💕💕💕💕💕
1333186436892266497 2020-11-30 07:09:50 +0800 <PaoMickel> I agree. She sat on the sidelines saying nothing to dispute the ridiculous statements made by trump and by her silence was complicit. I don’t care how smart she is, for months she chose to toe the trump line. I am disgusted by her.
1333132741689233408 2020-11-30 03:36:28 +0800 <PaoMickel> Love this visual.💕👍👏
1333132316688859136 2020-11-30 03:34:47 +0800 <PaoMickel> I already though she was stupid, looks like she has stupid friends too!🥺

1333128893822164992 2020-11-30 03:21:11 +0800 <PaoMickel> Me too. I would like him impeached again well. Give him something else to “brag” about. Only POTUS in history to be impeached twice!
1333125273320005633 2020-11-30 03:06:48 +0800 <PaoMickel> Great, by 2024 he will have 2 great Presidents to moan about. 😂😂
1333123132417220608 2020-11-30 02:58:17 +0800 <PaoMickel> Self serving scum bag.

1332933940424818688 2020-11-29 14:26:30 +0800 <PaoMickel> If it was the only wine on the planet, wouldn’t buy it.  Would not  put a penny in your corrupt charity raiding hands.
1332919702251737088 2020-11-29 13:29:56 +0800 <PaoMickel> If their futures are on the line I put my money on all of them.

1332907770727723008 2020-11-29 12:42:31 +0800 <PaoMickel> Totally believable. Shows how desperate America wants to get rid of your Pater.
1332863925021392896 2020-11-29 09:48:17 +0800 <PaoMickel> They’re working on it while you have your head in the sand.

1332045888613617665 2020-11-27 03:37:42 +0800 <PaoMickel> There should be no official portrait either. Instead they can hang a picture of a mango or a pumpkin.

1331575881278447617 2020-11-25 20:30:04 +0800 <PaoMickel> Simple. Moscow Mitch rigged the Kentucky election.

1331571858659975168 2020-11-25 20:14:05 +0800 <PaoMickel> If you support American Greatness you must therefor support Biden’s picks! You have lost all credibility and have destroyed your long term political future.
1331570705863831552 2020-11-25 20:09:30 +0800 <PaoMickel> Thinking of you and your Dad. Sending positive vibes and know many are out there praying for you.

1331442970457825280 2020-11-25 11:41:55 +0800 <PaoMickel> Yes, absolutely. We have already seen the benefits of mask wearing with the reduction in flu cases so far this year. I have been travelling regularly around Asia for 45 years and mask wearing is accepted as normal and am baffled by the anti maskers.
1331384873844498438 2020-11-25 07:51:04 +0800 <PaoMickel> That # dorky can be directly attributed to the markets rejoicing over the Biden win.
1331302025498279937 2020-11-25 02:21:51 +0800 <PaoMickel> Your eyes will then fall on a true leader. JOE BIDEN!
1331301810229809157 2020-11-25 02:21:00 +0800 <PaoMickel> So you’d rather continue to follow the path of destruction and hypocrisy you and your GOP lapdogs have been on for 4 years. Quoting the Bible while supporting trumpy shows what you really are.  A useless self serving.
1331299665959026695 2020-11-25 02:12:29 +0800 <PaoMickel> 100%. trumps lackeys have probably planted bugs everywhere.

1331127872472322048 2020-11-24 14:49:50 +0800 <PaoMickel> So where were they during impeachment? They are cowards who have placed America at risk for personal gain. Patriotism be damned. They are complicit in every single one of trumps dastardly schemes.

1330597339250126848 2020-11-23 03:41:41 +0800 <PaoMickel> By his actions he is giving America the middle finger.

1330365497985011712 2020-11-22 12:20:26 +0800 <PaoMickel> Can’t believe it’s 57 years. Can remember that awful day as if it was yesterday.
1330364606078922753 2020-11-22 12:16:53 +0800 <PaoMickel> Thinking of you and your Mom and glad you can see her. You never know she may pull through and seeing you will give her strength. 🙏🏻
1330363536984264704 2020-11-22 12:12:38 +0800 <PaoMickel> 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1330335056267767810 2020-11-22 10:19:28 +0800 <PaoMickel> No she will get what she deserves one day for obstructing the transition and placing America at possible risk.
1330333979262685184 2020-11-22 10:15:11 +0800 <PaoMickel> Let him, hopefully he will be behind bars or living in exile.

1329846332580773888 2020-11-21 01:57:27 +0800 <PaoMickel> How can so many people bow to the whims of orange moron? They must be getting paid a pile of money for them to destroy their reputations for ever. Either that or they are all as rotten to core as trump and his personal lapdogs.
1329845245844996097 2020-11-21 01:53:08 +0800 <PaoMickel> What a joke.
1329690449024483328 2020-11-20 15:38:02 +0800 <PaoMickel> What does trump have on Graham?
1329659953330601985 2020-11-20 13:36:51 +0800 <PaoMickel> @realDonaldTrump what a small insecure little man you are. Every day you dig your hole deeper and make a bigger fool of yourself. You once said “Maybe I’ll have to leave the Country if I  lose the election”. I’d say the sooner the better.

1329227548853616640 2020-11-19 08:58:38 +0800 <PaoMickel> Hopefully they are identified and charged.
1329225728886329344 2020-11-19 08:51:24 +0800 <PaoMickel> Because he is likely being blackmailed and received orders.

1328907004488740865 2020-11-18 11:44:54 +0800 <PaoMickel> That’s a question a few hundred thousand voters would like the answer to.
1328905899436507136 2020-11-18 11:40:30 +0800 <PaoMickel> What a heartless moron.

1328849705997012992 2020-11-18 07:57:13 +0800 <PaoMickel> 🤮what a tool he is!
1328848903358169088 2020-11-18 07:54:02 +0800 <PaoMickel> I don’t read this as nothing will be done about trump’s crimes while in office but rather Biden will not initiate anything. .eave i5 up to Congress and the civil courts.
1328848417380986885 2020-11-18 07:52:06 +0800 <PaoMickel> Absolutely yes.
1328848319989235714 2020-11-18 07:51:42 +0800 <PaoMickel> 😂😂😂😂😷
1328847779930673152 2020-11-18 07:49:34 +0800 <PaoMickel> I think he is very wise to stay out of any potential charges and prosecutions. Doing otherwise would tarnish his reputation and would be used by the GOP as a sign of vengeance.
1328842810074644480 2020-11-18 07:29:49 +0800 <PaoMickel> He looks totally weird. Satan must be taking over his body.
1328571192438091776 2020-11-17 13:30:30 +0800 <PaoMickel> Absolutely yes. It’s a crime no matter what election we are talking about. You do not ever put in a fix in an election and get away with it.
1328570072424648704 2020-11-17 13:26:03 +0800 <PaoMickel> Too late to recount the ballots for Jaime are likely destroyed by now. Lindsay Graham should be removed from his position and an election held to replace him.
1328560397822042113 2020-11-17 12:47:36 +0800 <PaoMickel> 🤞🤞🤞🤞hope beautiful boy finds a loving forever home.
1328549060827987971 2020-11-17 12:02:34 +0800 <PaoMickel> So Graham’s suggestion was unsuccessful with Raffensperger wonder how many took him up on his suggestion. And what about the 1/2 million he offered trump after he spent months crying on national TV about having no money. Was he paid by someone?  I smell a rat.
1328547618280992769 2020-11-17 11:56:50 +0800 <PaoMickel> 100% agree. An investigation is warranted.

1328391339017261058 2020-11-17 01:35:50 +0800 <PaoMickel> Atlas should have his medical credentials revoked. He has obviously slipped into the “quack” zone.

1327874103412285441 2020-11-15 15:20:31 +0800 <PaoMickel> She should also not receive a paycheque until such time as she does her job. Where does trump and his cohorts find so many people willing to do their bidding?
1327873262869565440 2020-11-15 15:17:11 +0800 <PaoMickel> Guess trump and his merry little men and women are getting desperate. Good, let them sweat and suffer for the crimes they have committed.
1327853939056726017 2020-11-15 14:00:24 +0800 <PaoMickel> WOW and the spin on the “assault” on this guy is mind blowing. I know we have the right to counter protest but until the moron is out of the WH and this hatred is under control if that is even possible we should stay far away from all Trumpers. Don’t be baited.
1327809526196621312 2020-11-15 11:03:55 +0800 <PaoMickel> Here here.
1327674966406414336 2020-11-15 02:09:13 +0800 <PaoMickel> Not surprised. The only life trump values is his own. Just reaffirms the monster he is by sanctioning the slaughter of beautiful animals.
1327667029801717760 2020-11-15 01:37:41 +0800 <PaoMickel> Beautiful and yes you do need the tissues. ❤️

1327628332058374150 2020-11-14 23:03:55 +0800 <PaoMickel> They were obviously confused and will not make the same mistake again. Texas will turn blue and your ineptitude is helping that change.
1327627822408450048 2020-11-14 23:01:53 +0800 <PaoMickel> Too late for all the people already dead or dying due to your irresponsible leadership or lack thereof. You have blood on your hands.
1327512396185751552 2020-11-14 15:23:13 +0800 <PaoMickel> and sniffing.
1327511794026389504 2020-11-14 15:20:50 +0800 <PaoMickel> If there is to be a trump portrait it should be hung in the bunker.

1327461514530287617 2020-11-14 12:01:02 +0800 <PaoMickel> How do these idiots garner the vote. They are empty vessels.
1327460402733621253 2020-11-14 11:56:37 +0800 <PaoMickel> Cancel the celebration dinner. Looks bad and makes no sense. Why do you think new representatives should be treated differently than my Mother, Grandmother or other relatives. Give your heads a shake. This is what turns people off politicians. Double standard.
1327459542150516736 2020-11-14 11:53:12 +0800 <PaoMickel> I think the optics of this gathering is really bad and more to the point dangerous and not in the best interests of the country. Can’t send mixed messages and expect a positive response.
1327457121772863495 2020-11-14 11:43:35 +0800 <PaoMickel> Too little too late.
1327456464684740610 2020-11-14 11:40:58 +0800 <PaoMickel> Seems crazy to me. There are around 80 million people in the US who likely agree with him.

1327159939773591553 2020-11-13 16:02:41 +0800 <PaoMickel> That will be tough as trumps #’s are growing daily. Goodness knows why anyone would follow him. Am hoping he has a massive meltdown so that Twitter can ban him for life. Joe started around 6 million and now over 18 million so moving along well but we have keep going. 😷

1326005130630627328 2020-11-10 11:33:53 +0800 <PaoMickel> “Rumour” has it that were thousands upon thousands of insurance votes floated into Kentucky and South Carolina by the GOP election campaign. Wonder why. Lady Linds and Moscow Mitch would be the benefactors. Makes total sense.
1326003205352816640 2020-11-10 11:26:14 +0800 <PaoMickel> What a disgrace you have become and for what, the support and golf games with the worst president in American history.
1326002655731183616 2020-11-10 11:24:03 +0800 <PaoMickel> Best news I’ve heard all day. Looking forward to the day you are no longer in an elected position. Who knows once investigations into all of the GOP lapdogs is concluded you’ll be looking for another job.
1325971278918922240 2020-11-10 09:19:22 +0800 <PaoMickel> Great story of much needed help. 💕 How a tweet led Ryan Reynolds to donate parkas to this Nunavut community  https://t.co/ILseOWCXzs  https://t.co/cfdAYVHRHT

1325101249440612352 2020-11-07 23:42:11 +0800 <PaoMickel> @ziyatong @MrJohnSimpson20 So true,😂😂😂
1324966164234072065 2020-11-07 14:45:24 +0800 <PaoMickel> Ooooh yes! No masks👏👏👏👏👏
1324965882225860608 2020-11-07 14:44:17 +0800 <PaoMickel> To see Steve Bannon, offer his services.😂😂😂😂 or out on a hunt to find Bill Barr.
1324964914805366786 2020-11-07 14:40:27 +0800 <PaoMickel> Ha ha. Who will he find to plead his case? Rudy?😂😂😂😂😂
1324964498151677954 2020-11-07 14:38:47 +0800 <PaoMickel> By 2024 trump’s cognitive abilities will be too depleted. He may also get covid-19, yes I know he “supposedly”  already had it but I don’t think so. It was all a con like everything else he does and staged to get the sympathy and strong man recovering vote.
1324956467770785792 2020-11-07 14:06:53 +0800 <PaoMickel> Nope, are you deaf and blind?  He is rotten to the core and the Chief Engineer along with trump of the evil actions of the trump administration.
1324943953863483397 2020-11-07 13:17:09 +0800 <PaoMickel> No, they are cheering Joe and Kamala and RBG will be there too.
1324921372695384065 2020-11-07 11:47:25 +0800 <PaoMickel> @RepMattGaetz You mean like “on” the floor. Can’t wait to see who takes you down. 😂😂😂😂😂  https://t.co/ABsC4LZAiR

1324837327508656129 2020-11-07 06:13:27 +0800 <PaoMickel> Yes, first day the process must be started.
1324790476478713857 2020-11-07 03:07:17 +0800 <PaoMickel> Hope this young msn us invited to the inauguration.
1324790155958382592 2020-11-07 03:06:01 +0800 <PaoMickel> Not much. Nobody likes to hire a liar.
1324789123551428609 2020-11-07 03:01:55 +0800 <PaoMickel> Add to that the President-elect served with the first Black President and now he will serve as the President to the fist 👇🏻
1324774823344570368 2020-11-07 02:05:05 +0800 <PaoMickel> So rumour has it you have deleted your tweets. If you are so proud of yourself why would you do that? You have effectively destroyed your future by being the mouthpiece for the worst president in US history. ‘Bye ‘bye.
1324770734435004418 2020-11-07 01:48:50 +0800 <PaoMickel> Happy Birthday Grandpa. Will raise a glass to your good health tonight.🥂🎂🎉❤️  https://t.co/fLKjGBTc2E

1324731338952372224 2020-11-06 23:12:18 +0800 <PaoMickel> What I cannot understand is why you still support the man who insulted your Wife and Father. Methinks you are even worse than trump if that is possible. Can’t wait for your reelection bid. 😂😂😂😂😂😷
1324727844329512960 2020-11-06 22:58:24 +0800 <PaoMickel> A massive  shoutout going to you Stacy. You were the inspiration that will bring Georgia over the finish line. John is looking down with a huge smile on his face and likely dancing too. 💙
1324725498170142720 2020-11-06 22:49:05 +0800 <PaoMickel> You are a lying turd just like your father. Go away.
1324724582700384256 2020-11-06 22:45:27 +0800 <PaoMickel> 😂😂😂😂😂
1324724472939597826 2020-11-06 22:45:01 +0800 <PaoMickel> Oh yes it is and trump had better start packing a “small” bag. Not much room in a jail cell for toiletries and “stuff”.
1324723624406773760 2020-11-06 22:41:38 +0800 <PaoMickel> They are all going to hurt because the gravy train they were on has returned to the station. All the GOP enablers will go straight to hell. 😷

1324554539966451713 2020-11-06 11:29:46 +0800 <PaoMickel> All smoke and mirrors.
1324552336279175168 2020-11-06 11:21:00 +0800 <PaoMickel> Precisely. Guaranteed income for 6 years while they make others suffer. 😷

1324523034019946497 2020-11-06 09:24:34 +0800 <PaoMickel> WOW and just imagine how many Americans would have voted if there was not heightened voter suppression. Last time I looked all the swamp elites are REPUBLICANS. trump and his GOP lapdogs  created the division and he thrives on it. He should be locked up for his crimes. 😷
1324521492537724928 2020-11-06 09:18:26 +0800 <PaoMickel> Not surprised, he is probably starting to strategize for 2024 Presidential election.
1324520984855019525 2020-11-06 09:16:25 +0800 <PaoMickel> Good, about time. Trump should be next.

1322759154239299585 2020-11-01 12:35:32 +0800 <PaoMickel> Where in the World is Bill Barr? 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1322755701870010368 2020-11-01 12:21:49 +0800 <PaoMickel> And the offspring are not much better.
1322755589231927296 2020-11-01 12:21:22 +0800 <PaoMickel> It’s called brainwashing. Not going to happen.🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1322665840181878788 2020-11-01 06:24:44 +0800 <PaoMickel> More than 600 dogs and cats are airlifted out of Hawaii for new homes on the US mainland  https://t.co/s3GIOVqG4t
1322591364257701888 2020-11-01 01:28:48 +0800 <PaoMickel> but it just fine to sentence to death 230000 Americans who already walked on this earth, who loved, worked and raised families. You are some special kind of hypocrite.
1322590519801782272 2020-11-01 01:25:27 +0800 <PaoMickel> Desperation has many outlets, this is one of them. When Joe wins we had better be prepared for more of this type of behaviour. Trump has brought out the worst in America. 🌊😷
1322589071265288192 2020-11-01 01:19:41 +0800 <PaoMickel> My heart aches for the desperation, helplessness and fear of the unknown these humans have to endure in an attempt to have a better life. This election is about good over evil. Joe  absolutely must win. VOTE🌊💙
1322585533738962950 2020-11-01 01:05:38 +0800 <PaoMickel> Why isn’t there a security detail with Biden? Clearly he needs one with these crazies on the loose.
1322583440261148672 2020-11-01 00:57:19 +0800 <PaoMickel> @danakay64 one more for you.🌊😷

1322545722919510016 2020-10-31 22:27:26 +0800 <PaoMickel> He was trashing him until a couple of days ago and then started to gush about what a kind person Barr is. Somethings up for sure.
1322543772975030272 2020-10-31 22:19:41 +0800 <PaoMickel> I agree, I think he is plotting trumps illegal take over of the USA. Biden will win but trump can’t lose!!!🌊🌊🌊😷

1322039358401122304 2020-10-30 12:55:20 +0800 <PaoMickel> Yes but which Country that doesn’t have an extradition treaty with the US will take him in? Saudi Arabia?🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1321975907108577280 2020-10-30 08:43:12 +0800 <PaoMickel> Yeah right!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🌊😷
1321866846732079104 2020-10-30 01:29:50 +0800 <PaoMickel> Wrong, trump is going down and if then UK has any sense the’ll do the same with you. Bury the Brexit party and you along with it.
1321866335068975105 2020-10-30 01:27:48 +0800 <PaoMickel> You are in a single word a “dangerous”. A pig of a man just like trump who is into dividing and not uniting. A sorry mess you’ve made of the UK with your “deplorable” Brexit party.
1321862040080719873 2020-10-30 01:10:44 +0800 <PaoMickel> Between Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson, they have done to the UK what trump has done to America. A take down of the political system.

1321676219427905536 2020-10-29 12:52:20 +0800 <PaoMickel> This is like something out of a crackpot 3rd world country playbook. The man has completely lost the plot! Lock him up.

1321670685798772736 2020-10-29 12:30:21 +0800 <PaoMickel> You are entitled to your opinion, however no comments can end a life, lock a child in a cage, attempt to deny a black person the right to due process and the list goes on. It is a wise man who believes he will be judged by the company he keeps. Jack Nicklaus is not a wise man.
1321669409589534721 2020-10-29 12:25:17 +0800 <PaoMickel> Yup, thought so. All about the almighty buck!🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷

1321654795980058624 2020-10-29 11:27:13 +0800 <PaoMickel> @jacknicklaus You have to be talking about someone else. You are a golfing icon yet you are promoting the most dangerous man in the World. Says a lot about a person when he approves of a monster like trump. Guess it is always about money. Trump belongs in jail. 🌊🌊🌊😷
1321645804583444481 2020-10-29 10:51:29 +0800 <PaoMickel> Impeach Kavanaugh.

1321492484325732354 2020-10-29 00:42:15 +0800 <PaoMickel> By now I hope he is locked up.
1321327644932071424 2020-10-28 13:47:14 +0800 <PaoMickel> Hope this guy is identified and fired. If self employed good luck, he just shut down his business.
1321327160292827140 2020-10-28 13:45:18 +0800 <PaoMickel> and then he left them all to freeze! Typical

1321282812972916737 2020-10-28 10:49:05 +0800 <PaoMickel> AMEN.  But we do have Joe and just as there is always a Good Woman behind a Great Man and vice versa so is the case of a great VP. For 8 years Joe was Obama’s right hand and should also be credited with Obama’s success as President just as Kamala will be Joe’s right hand.  🌊😷
1321256968976097280 2020-10-28 09:06:23 +0800 <PaoMickel> Thanks Grandpa. 6days🤞🌊😷
1321234643543228416 2020-10-28 07:37:41 +0800 <PaoMickel> Desperation pushes people to do crazy things. When trump loses the election we had better brace ourselves for a series of catastrophes. Need a monster blue tsunami.🌊🌊🌊🌊😷

1320162398716608512 2020-10-25 08:36:57 +0800 <PaoMickel> So now the question is, can the NYPD with theft? If you try to do the right thing your property is stolen. I am at a loss for words other than to say I don’t think this behaviour instills confidence and security I the citizenry!
1320148403397914624 2020-10-25 07:41:21 +0800 <PaoMickel> Is this ever going to stop? These cops should either not be cops or need more training. This is just not right.

1319464930588831745 2020-10-23 10:25:28 +0800 <PaoMickel> @realDonaldTrump only one solution to deal with up you and that is to lock you and your family snd throw away the keys. You are the greatest threat to democracy in America. Traitor.

1318763509128196096 2020-10-21 11:58:16 +0800 <PaoMickel> I keep asking myself, are there any ethical Republicans? Think the answer is no, they are mostly just as evil and corrupt as trump. Birds of a feather.🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1318736161142046721 2020-10-21 10:09:36 +0800 <PaoMickel> Coming from him that’s rich. 🌊🌊🌊🌊😷

1318673201384230912 2020-10-21 05:59:25 +0800 <PaoMickel> I hope he has legal representation. He was doing exactly what he was supposed be doing and sad that a few Americans have lost their common sense, compassion and personal dignity. I hold on the the thought they are a minority and most people are good. 🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1318671024708227072 2020-10-21 05:50:46 +0800 <PaoMickel> Hope he is back soon. Lot to do for the next 14 Days.🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷

1318670009787281408 2020-10-21 05:46:44 +0800 <PaoMickel> So did Meadows know this when he was still in Congress? They are all liars and crooks. Makes me sick.🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1318666092491862016 2020-10-21 05:31:10 +0800 <PaoMickel> Someone is holding something over their heads. Blackmail. These two have always been useless and need to be voted out in 2023 and 2022 respectively. Never too soon to start planning their ousters.🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷

1318454446590812160 2020-10-20 15:30:10 +0800 <PaoMickel> Why on earth would Isaac think it is OK to hand over a copy of a supposed Hunter Biden hard drive. I should think many laws have be3n broken by Isaac and Guiliani who received stolen goods.
1318453216376352769 2020-10-20 15:25:17 +0800 <PaoMickel> Great news👍🌊😷

1318443014868463616 2020-10-20 14:44:44 +0800 <PaoMickel> What a load of bollocks. The last thing trump would tolerate is someone anyone questioning him unless it is blonde.🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1318441149774745603 2020-10-20 14:37:20 +0800 <PaoMickel> Is there anything worse than a nightmare? If there is that would be what trump is giving many of us with his out of his mind presidency! He’s lost it.🌊😷
1318382244415696896 2020-10-20 10:43:16 +0800 <PaoMickel> I have a feeling come January 3 2021 things will start to move. Trump should most definitely be held accountable for the deaths from Covid-19, children and adults held in custody. HE IS 100% RESPONSIBLE. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1318381006915731460 2020-10-20 10:38:21 +0800 <PaoMickel> 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1318380739402944512 2020-10-20 10:37:17 +0800 <PaoMickel> Lying piece of it. 🌊😷
1318380486868094977 2020-10-20 10:36:17 +0800 <PaoMickel> The only condition to qualify for Health Care coverage is Birth at which time you are issued an ID Health # which stays with you until you meet your Maker. No questions no bills just Health Care. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1318378222568894465 2020-10-20 10:27:17 +0800 <PaoMickel> I’d like to know too. Seems that everyone is singing from trumps song book. The only thing we can hope for is immediately post election when the Dems hold  2/3 in the house and hopefully the same in the Senate, they can remove him and charge him with Treason.🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1318301766035722240 2020-10-20 05:23:28 +0800 <PaoMickel> Bit late to follow for the boost to 4000 but have followed for , like your tweets, best reason to follow.
1318287211574423552 2020-10-20 04:25:38 +0800 <PaoMickel> Yup he’s scared of having to answer the tough questions.  RE ELECT DOUG JONES🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1318233008365662208 2020-10-20 00:50:15 +0800 <PaoMickel> You and all other GOP spineless lapdogs have enabled the worst POTUS in history. That tells me you are just like him and that is time for a change.  Mary J Hegar will be a great Senator for Texas. 🌊😷

1318023424720076801 2020-10-19 10:57:26 +0800 <PaoMickel> Heartbreaking. This should be the a priority of a Biden administration to reunite all the children separated from their children. I look at my 3 year old Granddaughter and know what separation would do to her. These children will suffer for the rest of their lives.
1317860671854276609 2020-10-19 00:10:43 +0800 <PaoMickel> They’re too stupid.🌊😷
1317860455352725504 2020-10-19 00:09:51 +0800 <PaoMickel> Bla bla bla.
1317860246073663488 2020-10-19 00:09:01 +0800 <PaoMickel> Robbing a children’s charity is ok by you then? The trumps are  all morally bankrupt yet you support them. I only have to check who you have worked for and support to realize you fall into the same category. Morally bankrupt. The Brits must be thankful you’re distracted. 🌊😷
1317856156392452099 2020-10-18 23:52:46 +0800 <PaoMickel> #TrumpTheSnake will be ushered out of the WH Jan 20 2021. ‘Bye donny.🌊🌊🌊🌊😷

1317696061750718464 2020-10-18 13:16:37 +0800 <PaoMickel> No politician? He is a hateful piece of human garbage. Turn the economy in which direction? He already tanked it and doesn’t have the grey matter to turn it around. Thinking about it you are a bit lacking in that department too!Go away 🌊😷
1317694752603611136 2020-10-18 13:11:25 +0800 <PaoMickel> 👍💕
1317687491311202304 2020-10-18 12:42:34 +0800 <PaoMickel> Try the truth. Trump will be gone Jan 2021 and your already tarnished image will be irretrievable. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

1317684750799101952 2020-10-18 12:31:40 +0800 <PaoMickel> He should be charged with inciting violence. Lock HIM up.  🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1317681441665216512 2020-10-18 12:18:31 +0800 <PaoMickel> Mind blowing. Is this really America?🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1317652560526729216 2020-10-18 10:23:45 +0800 <PaoMickel> Totally agree. All animals have been rescues including our pups cats, bunnies, hamsters and guinea pigs. No bad animals just too many rotten humans and puppy mills should not exist. Shem them down.
1317568922594340864 2020-10-18 04:51:25 +0800 <PaoMickel> Check my tweets, I have said from day 2 he never had Covid-19. It was the Con of 2020
1317539506912784384 2020-10-18 02:54:31 +0800 <PaoMickel> Nay, finely chopped green onion. Celery in tuna salad. Yum
1317516109998825474 2020-10-18 01:21:33 +0800 <PaoMickel> Happy to see they are all masked up. Intelligence and concern for others on full display unlike trump rallies, ignorance and blatant disregard for the health of others. 🌊😷
1317498484459671552 2020-10-18 00:11:31 +0800 <PaoMickel> add to that criminal activity by his supporters. We have to vigilant🌊🌊🌊🌊😷.

1317348374778060802 2020-10-17 14:15:02 +0800 <PaoMickel> Is Hunter Biden running  for office? You really would be wise not to go down that rabbit hole considering the trump siblings, spouses and all the connected  offspring  with cushy jobs in the WH! Trump is a criminal and will be prosecuted one day for his crimes against America. 🌊
1317346592190464001 2020-10-17 14:07:57 +0800 <PaoMickel> But where can he run to? Doubt that any Country would want a morally and financially broke albatross. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1317344247780052992 2020-10-17 13:58:38 +0800 <PaoMickel> Fat cat who doesn’t give a shit about anyone but himself. All need to go and if they can be charged once trump is out of office better still. Strong message needs to be sent to any future political criminals that this behaviour is not OK and justice will be served.  🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷

1316882936868659201 2020-10-16 07:25:33 +0800 <PaoMickel> Is this some kind of reverse physiology? Seriously Feinstein has lost her mind unless she was attending another hearing that I wasn’t watching! Time to move over and move out.

1316798632100679681 2020-10-16 01:50:33 +0800 <PaoMickel> trumps are afraid of the truth and the reality that they are in deep trouble.🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷

1316617665344016384 2020-10-15 13:51:27 +0800 <PaoMickel> What on earth is going on in the heads of these malicious idiots?  No wonder people are down on the cops. If they have to be taught right from wrong after they are hired, they shouldn’t have been hired in the first place.🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1316615681031327745 2020-10-15 13:43:34 +0800 <PaoMickel> What a handsome young man and so lucky to have a Dad who is open and supportive. I loved reading your thread.💕💕💕💕💕

1316606890936135681 2020-10-15 13:08:38 +0800 <PaoMickel> A decisive victory is a must. For the interim period Nov 3 to inauguration trump should be put on notice to behave or suffer the consequences of his actions.🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1316576674910093313 2020-10-15 11:08:34 +0800 <PaoMickel> @realDonaldTrump so according to you all the kids should be back in school. What you forgot to mention is all children except your Son Barron. Hypocrite.🌊🌊🌊🌊😷

1316564750319247361 2020-10-15 10:21:11 +0800 <PaoMickel> Deport the bastard. There must be an immigration law provision whereby an immigrant can be deported if they are found  to be guilty of crimes against their adopted Country.

1316422214716059648 2020-10-15 00:54:48 +0800 <PaoMickel> This is an example of an expression having a double meaning depending on what corner of the planet you hail from. Having followed Martin for a long time cannot imagine his intention was the sexual use of the phrase. Let’s stick together and win this election.🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😂
1316419498090459136 2020-10-15 00:44:00 +0800 <PaoMickel> Maybe he thinks he is the second coming of John Travolta!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1316417694556549121 2020-10-15 00:36:50 +0800 <PaoMickel> Trump should be checked for a wire. He is mentally incapable of responding to substantive questions on policy or anything for that matter.

1316190219171885056 2020-10-14 09:32:56 +0800 <PaoMickel> I agree. I discussed the grilling with my husband and suggested his camouflaged GOP leanings were on full display. It was shocking and wouldn’t let her finish a sentence.

1314626975646904320 2020-10-10 02:01:10 +0800 <PaoMickel> WOW arrogance and disdain on full display. Guess he “has no words” to justify his failures to his constituents. Vote him out and VOTE FOR PHIL ARBALLO. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1314625922633527296 2020-10-10 01:56:59 +0800 <PaoMickel> Me too. 🌊🌊🌊😷
1314625614930825216 2020-10-10 01:55:45 +0800 <PaoMickel> I think he is a snake. He who made the separating of children even worse than Sessions. They should all be tried for Human Rights abuses.

1314415749058891777 2020-10-09 12:01:49 +0800 <PaoMickel> Dear gawd! Get out the straight jacket. Noticed Javanka and the rest of the crime family have been quiet lately. Probably trying to figure out what will be left if daddy’s estate once he is forced to settle his debts with the Russian mob. 🌊🌊🌊😷
1314409957459066880 2020-10-09 11:38:49 +0800 <PaoMickel> 💆🏼🙋‍♀️🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1314409391362244608 2020-10-09 11:36:34 +0800 <PaoMickel> What on earth is he talking about? His rush to get back to the WH is probably because he needed his stash. Makes sense when you consider locks doors etc.  🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1314405375001600001 2020-10-09 11:20:36 +0800 <PaoMickel> Thanks Temecula. Have followed.  all not on my list retweeted and 💙blue 🌊😷

1314399969139281921 2020-10-09 10:59:07 +0800 <PaoMickel> Everyone should know the names of these rotten bastards by heart and make them pay.
1314399768601227265 2020-10-09 10:58:19 +0800 <PaoMickel> They should all be charged with human rights abuses. What kind of humans would do this to children and their parents. My heart 💔and pray that all will be reunited. This should be a top priority when Joe takes office. He will have thousands of volunteers willing to help.🌊🌊😷
1314398193333891072 2020-10-09 10:52:04 +0800 <PaoMickel> and then morons like this piece of garbage will quote the Bible. The hypocrisy of the GOP is disgusting.
1314395284005220352 2020-10-09 10:40:30 +0800 <PaoMickel> Good he should be fired and never work again. 🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1314393911129903105 2020-10-09 10:35:03 +0800 <PaoMickel> but can he pardon himself? Dreaming of a calm organized America respected once again around the World. Joe can do this but really sad that the Dems have to spend so many terms cleaning up after the GOP when they could be moving us all forward with Dem policies. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🤣
1314388597726822405 2020-10-09 10:13:56 +0800 <PaoMickel> Why on earth does she have to disclose her race. This is shocking. Are we really in the year 2020? There has to be a complete overhaul in our thinking at every level on every issue. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1314373573264326656 2020-10-09 09:14:14 +0800 <PaoMickel> Go Jamie. You can win. Get rid of the vermin and start the healing of America at every level of Government.🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷

1314031510794637312 2020-10-08 10:35:00 +0800 <PaoMickel> This moderator was not effective and showed way too much deference to Pence. Pence is sick his eyes are oozing and he looks awful.
1314028867049279488 2020-10-08 10:24:30 +0800 <PaoMickel> That looks like pink eye a possible covid-19 symptom, I am not kidding.  Conjunctivitis.

1313941730475925504 2020-10-08 04:38:15 +0800 <PaoMickel> Possible that is his strategy but it’s a losing one. He is showing the Country and the World how vindictive he is and I don’t think America can remain on this roller coaster ride for another 4 years. Everyone is skittish and exhausted. 🌊🌊🌊🌊😷

1313584894442840065 2020-10-07 05:00:18 +0800 <PaoMickel> Pence as Chair of the Coronavirus Task Force shows how incapable he is of being non partisan and taking seriously the wellbeing of Kamala Harris. He and his cohorts have only one thing in mind, self preservation. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷VOTE

1313257981203472384 2020-10-06 07:21:16 +0800 <PaoMickel> Someone needs to create a meme with trump riding a horse with a bare fat belly. He is trying to show how tough he is just a carbon copy his Russian ufol!😂😂😂😂
1313205182608539648 2020-10-06 03:51:28 +0800 <PaoMickel> Thanks to trumps recent tweets the anti maskers and trump are going to infect all of us. He is without a doubt the most dangerous man in the world and doesn’t have to fire a shot. Just stay in his bubble and unleash the pandemic on the population. VOTE your life depends on it.😷
1313200627418198016 2020-10-06 03:33:22 +0800 <PaoMickel> Totally.
1313199968602091520 2020-10-06 03:30:45 +0800 <PaoMickel> Put money on it that trump never had covid. He saw an opportunity with a Hicks infection and saw an opportunity. Now Walter Reed staff is covering for him. Never forget trump is the “king of the con”. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1313198623723671552 2020-10-06 03:25:24 +0800 <PaoMickel> Dr. Sean Conley’s career should be over. I wouldn’t trust him for a mild sinus infection or anything else for that matter.  🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷

1313127745447026690 2020-10-05 22:43:45 +0800 <PaoMickel> trump has conned America yet again. Put money on it that he is virus free and just another of his campaign strategies. Albeit a cruel one when you think of the 214000 who died and those who survived who will live with the consequences for years. He is sick, yes, but in the head.
1313126581196316673 2020-10-05 22:39:08 +0800 <PaoMickel> Checked all lists but had everyone already but retweeted for all on my list. Have a wonderful day.🌞

1312954062304800768 2020-10-05 11:13:36 +0800 <PaoMickel> @IvankaTrump For you to make this statement is proof that you are as stupid as your pater.

1312884073124167680 2020-10-05 06:35:29 +0800 <PaoMickel> Why is Jason Miller on CNN now? He a useless turd and getting more air time than God. Telling us trump has had an epiphany now trump knows how bad it is. Load of garbage, he is lying and Trump cannot recover that quickly I don’t care who is looking after him. We are being played.

1312605775504633857 2020-10-04 12:09:38 +0800 <PaoMickel> First of all trump doesn’t work and secondly all the idiots are now wearing masks.

He is only interested in the radical right that includes the proud  boys and his base. Mind blowing that in 2020 we are facing the end of democracy. VOTE, YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT.🌊🌊🌊😷

1312406444000460800 2020-10-03 22:57:34 +0800 <PaoMickel> My fingers are crossed for Stephen Miller too.

1312257505175629824 2020-10-03 13:05:44 +0800 <PaoMickel> GOP is running out of campaign money so what better way is there keep trump in the news 24/7. Free campaigning. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1312256849408749569 2020-10-03 13:03:08 +0800 <PaoMickel> and the Senate.🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷

1312116115091329025 2020-10-03 03:43:54 +0800 <PaoMickel> Thanks Petra, found a few not on my list.👍Have followed retweeted and 💙. Looking forward to new followers and their interesting tweets.
1312070333172604928 2020-10-03 00:41:59 +0800 <PaoMickel> It’s a hoax. Until a medical professional representing the US government makes a public statement  on firming that  trump is tested positive I will continue to believe it is a hoax. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1312069562767007744 2020-10-03 00:38:55 +0800 <PaoMickel> Heartbreaking to lose a beloved pet. 💔🙏🏻🌈
1312068065236934656 2020-10-03 00:32:58 +0800 <PaoMickel> Sorry, can’t think of anything. Will just have to meet my maker! 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷

1312062685358374912 2020-10-03 00:11:35 +0800 <PaoMickel> Until a Doctor declares trump has COBID-19  I will stick to my belief that it is fakes news and a hoax. He wants sympathy and he doesn’t want to debate so is killing two birds with one stone. He is nothing but a low life con man and liar. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1312021811748466688 2020-10-02 21:29:10 +0800 <PaoMickel> Good morning all are we ready for another fun filled day? We can all start by following Kamala she is almost at 6 million.

1312020466182189056 2020-10-02 21:23:49 +0800 <PaoMickel> Shameful but no one will be surprised. As we all know he only cares about himself. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1312019177343836160 2020-10-02 21:18:42 +0800 <PaoMickel> What a bastard. He just has to blame someone else and takes no responsibility for his own irresponsible actions. 🐷 of a man. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1312015662575837185 2020-10-02 21:04:44 +0800 <PaoMickel> Totally love the list that is comprised of some of the worst in GOP party.

1312008193384439813 2020-10-02 20:35:03 +0800 <PaoMickel> Exactly. Better to admit to a mistake than to repeat it. trump had a lot of people fooled and hopefully most now recognize him for the cheap con man that he is. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1311916225149071361 2020-10-02 14:29:36 +0800 <PaoMickel> Like the way you think! 🤔 wouldn’t put it past him. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷

1311547863755681793 2020-10-01 14:05:52 +0800 <PaoMickel> I’d say and lacking serious grooming. Looked like he just climbed out of bed or from under a rock.,🤣
1311545950733647872 2020-10-01 13:58:16 +0800 <PaoMickel> Fire Paul Crews. Blatant racism does not belong anywhere in our society and certainly not in our classrooms. To be promoted by a teacher is an abomination. Spread the word tweeters.  🌊🌊🌊🌊😷

1311218730634936322 2020-09-30 16:18:01 +0800 <PaoMickel> Probably a processing device like an external brain. Boy does he ever need one of those! 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷

1311216659303002112 2020-09-30 16:09:47 +0800 <PaoMickel> I completely agree, no point nothing constructive or informative will be forthcoming. Just more bullying. I’d like Joe to take him out behind the gym!🤣🌊😷
1311216215688318977 2020-09-30 16:08:01 +0800 <PaoMickel> Go Grandma. Love 💕it when you talk dirty! Seriously though that was without a doubt the most disgraceful display of human trump trash yet. He has to go.🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1311171801892839424 2020-09-30 13:11:32 +0800 <PaoMickel> Agreed. No point, all trump did was verbally stalk Biden and spew complete rubbish with the moderator unable to regain any control. Was nothing but a. All yo arms for trump and more debates will set the groundwork for more hate.🌊👏

1311120207704858625 2020-09-30 09:46:31 +0800 <PaoMickel> Chris Wallace is a big disappointment. He is allowing trump to interrupt and ramble.
1311119413223931904 2020-09-30 09:43:22 +0800 <PaoMickel> Yup, oozing out his nose soon.

1310790904827899905 2020-09-29 11:57:59 +0800 <PaoMickel> What’s to stop trump selling America’s secrets once he is out of office? He is desperate for money and am sure many foreign powers would pay big bucks for information he likely has.  LOCK HIM UP

1310759204915830785 2020-09-29 09:52:01 +0800 <PaoMickel> They are probably raking in tax free dollars from God knows where and scared shI—-ss they are going to get caught.

1307380719354748931 2020-09-20 02:07:08 +0800 <PaoMickel> So where is Barr when election rules are violated? Of forgot he is enabling this behaviour.🌊😷
1307354574613700608 2020-09-20 00:23:14 +0800 <PaoMickel> Guess you’ll be praying for trump 24 x 7 until your dying day for lives he has deliberately taken.
1307233599821815809 2020-09-19 16:22:32 +0800 <PaoMickel> Cold hearted hypocrite.  Your days as as a Senator are numbered.🌊😷

1307172205411708930 2020-09-19 12:18:34 +0800 <PaoMickel> This move by McConnell makes me physically ill. He is the most disgusting example of a human being.
1307102324805042180 2020-09-19 07:40:53 +0800 <PaoMickel> To all my followers, this is a n organization promoting the importance of our youth vote. Please retweet. There will be other notices sent out regularly. 🙏🏻

1307063666714521604 2020-09-19 05:07:16 +0800 <PaoMickel> He looks like one of those rubber blow up horror room mannequins.
1307063175339282432 2020-09-19 05:05:19 +0800 <PaoMickel> So trump stood by and watched Puerto Rican’s suffer unimaginable hardship since 2017 and is now trying to buy votes. Soooo transparent and not going to work. 🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1307040539414532098 2020-09-19 03:35:22 +0800 <PaoMickel> Every day trump shows his ignorance. 🌊😷

1307025692068962305 2020-09-19 02:36:23 +0800 <PaoMickel> So now the election is around the corner you are rolling out what you think will help your reelection. Voters are not that stupid. You have had 23 years to make improvements in Maine, now you are too late. GO SARA🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1306809439274414080 2020-09-18 12:17:04 +0800 <PaoMickel> Another an narcissistic monster.
1306797692689948672 2020-09-18 11:30:23 +0800 <PaoMickel> You are ineffective. Resign.
1306783389240954880 2020-09-18 10:33:33 +0800 <PaoMickel> Let’s face reality here, he doesn’t have a strategy on anything. Too busy trying to stay out of jail!🌊😷💙
1306772411006640128 2020-09-18 09:49:56 +0800 <PaoMickel> 355 million people.🌊
1306772043073875968 2020-09-18 09:48:28 +0800 <PaoMickel> Pretty soon there may be almost no red states at the rate he is going. 😂🌊😷
1306770623130025986 2020-09-18 09:42:49 +0800 <PaoMickel> Go away ditsy. 🌊😷
1306752581029384192 2020-09-18 08:31:08 +0800 <PaoMickel> So guess they get sick, some will die. In the meantime we will have an approved vaccine and wear our masks to protect us from the magat ignoramuses. How can they be this stupid?
1306749817696079872 2020-09-18 08:20:09 +0800 <PaoMickel> Hope it’s not too late. DeJoy should be charged and held accountable.
1306748958882971650 2020-09-18 08:16:44 +0800 <PaoMickel> Will add he has extended medical through his former workplace but no claim necessary. All covered by what is known as BC Medical. Until January of 2020 it cost a senior couple $70 per month now there is no charge.🇨🇦
1306748255749853184 2020-09-18 08:13:57 +0800 <PaoMickel> Friend in BC age 86 found unconscious in his condo. Called 911 ambulance rushed to emergency had a stone in his bile duct. Non invasive laser procedure to remove stone monitored in hospital for 5 days. All well and will have day surgery to remove gall bladder. No charge.

1306664550796726272 2020-09-18 02:41:20 +0800 <PaoMickel> Makes no sense. I am guessing they must be happily wallowing in the poverty that Moscow Mitch has manage to lock them in for the last 36 years in the Senate. 🌊😷
1306656539390877696 2020-09-18 02:09:30 +0800 <PaoMickel> 👍unfortunately we all know that isn’t going to happen.🌊😷
1306656208426688514 2020-09-18 02:08:11 +0800 <PaoMickel> Is that all the green backs that trump has stolen from American taxpayers? All knows is how to take. Drain the swamp, lock him up rebuild America. Bydon! 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1306643006557020161 2020-09-18 01:15:43 +0800 <PaoMickel> Thanks Grandpa, followed all resisters not on my list, retweeted and 💙. Look forward to Follow backs.💫🌊😷
1306641402046996481 2020-09-18 01:09:21 +0800 <PaoMickel> Congress is Blue, Senate is Red as we all know. For Congress to take legal action now would likely make not one iota of difference just provide trump with more ammunition on how his administration is being persecuted  by the Dems. Crimes will still be crimes after January 20 2021
1306553665142972418 2020-09-17 19:20:43 +0800 <PaoMickel> The world is watching and laughing at this 🤡.VOTE💙🌊😷
1306550977248415745 2020-09-17 19:10:02 +0800 <PaoMickel> You’re correct. Mind blowing the corruption in the WH.

1306546553046228992 2020-09-17 18:52:27 +0800 <PaoMickel> Nor I. Sometimes I run through his tweets to see if there is one that needs a blasting but over my dead body would I follow him.
1306546029282562049 2020-09-17 18:50:22 +0800 <PaoMickel> And Keirsten whatever her name is. Do none of them get how “not good” this is?

1306530106072944640 2020-09-17 17:47:06 +0800 <PaoMickel> Pro covid vaccine but anti vaxer. Guess vaccines are a good idea if they prop up his political agenda. Not so long ago he was railing about how some vaccines affect children. This piece of human garbage has to go.
1306529294030573569 2020-09-17 17:43:52 +0800 <PaoMickel> Robert Redfield.
1306455912429707264 2020-09-17 12:52:16 +0800 <PaoMickel> The three goons.
1306434920504422400 2020-09-17 11:28:52 +0800 <PaoMickel> He”s too ignorant to grasp even the simplest piece of information. Dumbest man in the USA bailed out repeatedly  by a Father who knew how stupid he is but propped him up to save face. Doesn’t say much for the grey matter occupying the brain cells of his offspring.
1306429762080894977 2020-09-17 11:08:22 +0800 <PaoMickel> Yup, me too..🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1306428709860114432 2020-09-17 11:04:11 +0800 <PaoMickel> Doubt it, that is on the wrong side of the political argument. They just like to argue against abortion.🌊😷
1306428160087523328 2020-09-17 11:02:00 +0800 <PaoMickel> The upside is that trump does like the colour orange.🤣🤣🤣🤣
1306399377598996481 2020-09-17 09:07:38 +0800 <PaoMickel> 😂😂😂bring it on sooner than later! 🥳🌊😷

1306388857001189377 2020-09-17 08:25:49 +0800 <PaoMickel> They’ll say he was joking, wanting to make people feel optimistic!😂😂😂🌊😷
1306388585684168706 2020-09-17 08:24:45 +0800 <PaoMickel> He’ll force Redfield out just watch. Not sure how but trump will find a way and replace him with a drooling lapdog. 🌊😷
1306385426458976256 2020-09-17 08:12:11 +0800 <PaoMickel> Hopefully the DEMs have a plan on how to deal with Barr after the inauguration.🌊😷
1306384316272750592 2020-09-17 08:07:47 +0800 <PaoMickel> This is all trump. The presidential enabler of bad behaviour.
1306379824789729280 2020-09-17 07:49:56 +0800 <PaoMickel> OMG call the Doctor. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1306369204094824448 2020-09-17 07:07:44 +0800 <PaoMickel> Yup he embraces bad behaviour. The worse it is the better he likes it and enables his followers to do the same. My heart aches for America. VOTE for JOE and KAMALA🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
1306285718730203142 2020-09-17 01:35:59 +0800 <PaoMickel> Everyone has their eye on the prize. JOE AND KAMALA 2020👍🌊😷

1306089010553528320 2020-09-16 12:34:20 +0800 <PaoMickel> Poetic justice.  Natures way.🌊😷
1306084067343958018 2020-09-16 12:14:42 +0800 <PaoMickel> If Dems win they should bide their time until pardons cannot be given. Wait it out and then slam the whole miserable gang top to bottom across the board. All of the enablers, cheats, liars and traitors. 🌊😷
1306083101685112832 2020-09-16 12:10:51 +0800 <PaoMickel> Why is trump tested everyday if he believes in herd immunity (trumps word mentality] not sure what on earth he is talking about. If he believes in this why is he hiding in his bubble. He is a lying hypocrite. 🌊😷
1306041927083544577 2020-09-16 09:27:15 +0800 <PaoMickel> WOW crazy article. Goes to show this group is a single issue organization. They don’t care trump doesn’t know one end of a Bible to the other he breaks all commandments just by existing flaunts his foul behaviour as badge of honour. Their organization is a sham to collect $’s.
1306033862745575428 2020-09-16 08:55:12 +0800 <PaoMickel> That person is a monster and not fit to enter a church never mind preach in one. If he still has a congregation when they read his tweet they are showing their true colours and racism.
1306016898455400450 2020-09-16 07:47:47 +0800 <PaoMickel> She should use the word unhinged and apply it to herself too.
1306004504119181312 2020-09-16 06:58:32 +0800 <PaoMickel> Done and dusted #FBRParty 2. Thanks Grandpa🙏🏻retweeted and 💙

1305998955679940608 2020-09-16 06:36:29 +0800 <PaoMickel> He should be fired. I used to watch him years ago but se3ms to be completely off the rails these days.
1305996138760212480 2020-09-16 06:25:18 +0800 <PaoMickel> Nothing and no one could scare me more than trump. If he is re-elected the US will end up having a civil war. We are halfway there already. He and his cronies are just getting started.
1305981879380713472 2020-09-16 05:28:38 +0800 <PaoMickel> He never looks alpha with anyone except Lady G.😂
1305981349241659392 2020-09-16 05:26:32 +0800 <PaoMickel> and then there are the Palestinian people who have lived as refugees for generation.
1305979424668413952 2020-09-16 05:18:53 +0800 <PaoMickel> Yup  #TrumpIsAPedo

1305977797098176513 2020-09-16 05:12:25 +0800 <PaoMickel> at “least”  5 hours in 24. He is an isolated empty shell.
1305974298163646464 2020-09-16 04:58:31 +0800 <PaoMickel> Followed all. 💙Asking my followers to do the same please🙏 we can do this.🌊😷
1305959488009060352 2020-09-16 03:59:40 +0800 <PaoMickel> Looks to me as if Trudeau has done a good job as have the provincial leaders.
1305955414098419713 2020-09-16 03:43:28 +0800 <PaoMickel> whoever said “it’s an  embarrassment” is right however sadly I think she was referring to the cops who were doing their job. Guy had a racist jab too. Another ignorant anti masker until someone in his orbit gets sick, then he’ll be screaming for a Doc. Misguided and brainwashed.
1305929153036922882 2020-09-16 01:59:07 +0800 <PaoMickel> Probably his ads are farmed out to Putin.
1305928961247997953 2020-09-16 01:58:22 +0800 <PaoMickel> Agreed. They had better have surveillance on Ghislaine Maxwell.
1305926762673569792 2020-09-16 01:49:37 +0800 <PaoMickel> Nothing less than a televised hearing of 11 hours for each of them.🌊😷
1305926258463617025 2020-09-16 01:47:37 +0800 <PaoMickel> ✋
1305925990153990146 2020-09-16 01:46:33 +0800 <PaoMickel> What I see is a poorly groomed man in a poorly tailored suit hunched over standing in front of a bunch of women who mostly look the same with all their bling on trying to impress. Poor misguided souls. One has a look on her face that says “not sure I believe you”!🤣
1305910663198334976 2020-09-16 00:45:39 +0800 <PaoMickel> You are so right. Terrifying.

1305900089810935808 2020-09-16 00:03:38 +0800 <PaoMickel> Another misogynist pig who has an ego the size of a mountain.
1305896906564886530 2020-09-15 23:50:59 +0800 <PaoMickel> Now will go online and buy your book and follow you so I know when others are published. To avid readers I enjoy the easy reading of Wendy Roberts armchair sleuth particularly the Bodies of Evidence and Grounds to kill books.
1305877142589157377 2020-09-15 22:32:27 +0800 <PaoMickel> When did he learn to read?🤣
1305875102580400128 2020-09-15 22:24:21 +0800 <PaoMickel> “I’m on stage and it is very far away” says trump again thinking only of himself not of those packed in to a covid-19 hot pot.
1305873179651571712 2020-09-15 22:16:42 +0800 <PaoMickel> This is sick. Read the whole thread. Trump is a clear and present danger but then we all know that. Scary.🌊😷

1305734347861811200 2020-09-15 13:05:02 +0800 <PaoMickel> So if Putin doesn’t get trump re-elected his back up plan is to kill us all with COVID-19.
1305733794964500481 2020-09-15 13:02:50 +0800 <PaoMickel> Liking the look of that map.👍🇨🇦💙🌊😷

1305687296583163906 2020-09-15 09:58:04 +0800 <PaoMickel> How can this be happening? The Doctors involved should be charged with malpractice.
1305686930235875329 2020-09-15 09:56:37 +0800 <PaoMickel> and mass human rights violations of the entire population of the USA!
1305686663503343616 2020-09-15 09:55:33 +0800 <PaoMickel> Maybe Russia is secretly building that bridge to Alaska!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🌊😷

1305670533028012032 2020-09-15 08:51:27 +0800 <PaoMickel> 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Trump pay? He never pays. There are venues all over the US still trying to collect money for historic rallies.
1305670147831545856 2020-09-15 08:49:56 +0800 <PaoMickel> What about all the idiots that are going to get sick end up in hospital and place a strain on the medical facilities. The 🤡 is basically say rules don’t apply to me. What a surprise.
1305654896897609728 2020-09-15 07:49:19 +0800 <PaoMickel> Go away Lady G time for you to retire. All you do is kiss trumps butt and that will soon be out of reach unless you occupy the same jail cell. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

1305643294513274881 2020-09-15 07:03:13 +0800 <PaoMickel> Can’t wait! I am sure there is a treasure trove of horrendous tapes out there collected by many over trumps lifetime. Once trash always trash and he cannot be redeemed. Don’t care how many pastors put their hands on him he is not going to change.  BOTE JOE and KAMALA🌊🌊🌊🌊😷
1305641940042489857 2020-09-15 06:57:50 +0800 <PaoMickel> Awe!💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
1305624016309219328 2020-09-15 05:46:37 +0800 <PaoMickel> How Hugh did you pay these seniors to make fools of themselves? If you keep this up half of them if not all of them will get covid-19 before this is over. Some may not survive. Use your common sense and put politics aside your lives and the lives of your loved ones depend on it.
1305617444094976000 2020-09-15 05:20:30 +0800 <PaoMickel> He looks bored and lost, mentally and physically impaired.🤣😷

1305556612052971521 2020-09-15 01:18:47 +0800 <PaoMickel> What is it about these #’s that trump doesn’t understand?  https://t.co/QUK9kyTFJH
1305545551639789568 2020-09-15 00:34:50 +0800 <PaoMickel> The new Mantra should be “if Joe Biden loses the election it is because trump rigged it.” This would actually be the truth unlike trumps wild accusations.  Vote Blue🌊😷
1305540159958523905 2020-09-15 00:13:24 +0800 <PaoMickel> I guess your “calmness” is the way you continue to support a sexual predator, liar, misogynist and ignoramus to use only a few descriptive words to describe trump. Are you also blind and stupid?
1305537474144268288 2020-09-15 00:02:44 +0800 <PaoMickel> Don’t worry, Gymmy your trail will for aiding and abetting sexual abuse will be much faster. Pretty sure all the evidence is prepared already. 🤣🤣🤣
1305535455509708801 2020-09-14 23:54:42 +0800 <PaoMickel> Too late, they already drank the Kool Aid! VOTE BLUE🌊😷

1305217578965454848 2020-09-14 02:51:35 +0800 <PaoMickel> That’s how it looks with these super spreader rallies. He doesn’t even respect his supposed supporters. Still think a lot of those in attendance are there for the 🤡show. 🌊😷
1305216502228856833 2020-09-14 02:47:18 +0800 <PaoMickel> Should be a hashtag #trumputinrig2020
1305210456252899328 2020-09-14 02:23:17 +0800 <PaoMickel> What a pathetic way to run and election. Pay stand ins! If Biden had done this it would be all over the news. 🌊😷
1305209131662336000 2020-09-14 02:18:01 +0800 <PaoMickel> Well done to Jake. Moving forward more interviews should be ended when trump surrogates try to change the narrative. 🌊😷
1305180764900749312 2020-09-14 00:25:18 +0800 <PaoMickel> Can’t wait to see a motorcade like this haul you off to jail. 🌊😷

1305170368101904385 2020-09-13 23:43:59 +0800 <PaoMickel> Maybe it’s because McConnell is also a bottom feeder.🦞🌊😷

1305010517396860929 2020-09-13 13:08:47 +0800 <PaoMickel> Guess they are trying to reduce the population in Florida.
1304985299139747844 2020-09-13 11:28:35 +0800 <PaoMickel> A swarm of morons without masks pushing past a man with his assist dog. Typical trump supporters.🌊😷
1304982094284685312 2020-09-13 11:15:51 +0800 <PaoMickel> via @NYTimes  We must never forget the cruelty of the trump administration. An innocent life cut short by hate racism and ignorance. Too late for this little girl but not too late for the others locked in cages and separated from their parents.🙏🏻  https://t.co/aFC6ATAWXt
1304876256790339585 2020-09-13 04:15:17 +0800 <PaoMickel> No doubt trump supports the dictator and if trump this will be the new America.  VOTE🌊😷
1304828743765037056 2020-09-13 01:06:29 +0800 <PaoMickel> Trump is a cornered animal right now and he and his comrades will stop at nothing to win. Shout VOTE BLUE from the rooftops.  🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊😷

1304606481162014720 2020-09-12 10:23:18 +0800 <PaoMickel> Looks like he is sleeping.
1304603474357698560 2020-09-12 10:11:21 +0800 <PaoMickel> That should’ve been “stay” off Twitter!
1304597398786891779 2020-09-12 09:47:12 +0800 <PaoMickel> Sending prayers and positive vibes. Dysgenic off Twitter otherwise your BP will go up. 🙏
1304596706428936193 2020-09-12 09:44:27 +0800 <PaoMickel> Guess the orange moron who cannot function without drugs and a teleprompter can’t comprehend Joe Biden can actually compose and deliver sentences without any help. They had better check trump for wires during the debates. 🌊😷
1304595128082812928 2020-09-12 09:38:11 +0800 <PaoMickel> Cruz is Putin’s eunuch.
1304593978994507777 2020-09-12 09:33:37 +0800 <PaoMickel> Have to take out the garbage first. All the corrupt SOB’s need to locked up and prevented from ever holding public office again .
1304593099415457792 2020-09-12 09:30:07 +0800 <PaoMickel> Bet trump never recognizes or thanks them so I say a big thank you and please stay safe.🙏
1304592502553362433 2020-09-12 09:27:45 +0800 <PaoMickel> @StefanoChase If looks could kill!😂🌊😷
1304590759799136256 2020-09-12 09:20:49 +0800 <PaoMickel> I cannot think of anyone that I have known ever that is as despicable and ignorant as trump. He is now ranting like Gaddafi, same character flaws put sons in Gov. Yup America has their own Gaddafi now.
1304580037513945088 2020-09-12 08:38:13 +0800 <PaoMickel> LOCK THEM UP.
1304579917166702592 2020-09-12 08:37:44 +0800 <PaoMickel> They aren’t listening to Biden. He has made it very clear that he is a bridge to the future. Interpret that as we may but I believe he will be a mentor for up and coming young people. 🌊😷
1304578556329033728 2020-09-12 08:32:20 +0800 <PaoMickel> You’re totally right problem is he just keeps on going. They should shut off his mike until he stops ranting and answers.🌊😷

1304281228984512512 2020-09-11 12:50:52 +0800 <PaoMickel> This is unbelievable. They are making a mockery of all  icons in dire need of help.
1304267252141785088 2020-09-11 11:55:19 +0800 <PaoMickel> What is the matter with this lunatic encouraging supporters to potentially get covid-19. He is showing blatant disregard for their health and as President is the opposite to what he should be doing. He took an oath to preserve and protect. He is a dangerous failure.
1304258328177119238 2020-09-11 11:19:52 +0800 <PaoMickel> When will  #TrumpTheRapist be brought to account?

1304229181824233472 2020-09-11 09:24:03 +0800 <PaoMickel> Is there anyone on my stream with SC-7 connections to give Melissa a boost online, donations and campaign help?🙏
1304210910676877312 2020-09-11 08:11:26 +0800 <PaoMickel> I am sure many Families and friendships have ended as a result of trumps presidency. He is a master divider.🌊😷
1304209411599077376 2020-09-11 08:05:29 +0800 <PaoMickel> That was supposed to be Awesome!😂😂😂😂

1304170413157543936 2020-09-11 05:30:31 +0800 <PaoMickel> Thought the same thing. He’s hoping to persuade older Judges to retire and praying that RBG will be forced to leave for health reasons. POS.
1304169295572729858 2020-09-11 05:26:05 +0800 <PaoMickel> Thanks Jonathan. Great list👍Followed and retweeted.🌊😷
1304163338201391104 2020-09-11 05:02:24 +0800 <PaoMickel> Every reporter should be asking why, when he knows the virus  is airborne is he not mandating masks? He is deliberately risking the lives of his supporters.
1304155473071894529 2020-09-11 04:31:09 +0800 <PaoMickel> Boy oh boy you are opening one hell of big can of trump worms! Doing a great job 👍encouraging voters to choose 💙Joe and Kamala💙. 🌊😷
1304154320414240768 2020-09-11 04:26:34 +0800 <PaoMickel> Well said🌊😷
1304147323040096262 2020-09-11 03:58:46 +0800 <PaoMickel> USA rated 9th in the world for deaths per capita and rising at approximately 1000+ per day. Soon will be second or 3 in deaths. Supposedly the most powerful country in the World has failed to keep Americans safe. Instead we have a conspiracy theorist in the WH. Shameful.
1304145946930896896 2020-09-11 03:53:18 +0800 <PaoMickel> Now the cat is out of the bag and we know that trump was fully aware that the coronavirus is airborne what’s next? You would expect a normal person to act and insist on masks, social distancing and hand washing. 200,000 have died because of his negligence. This is murder.
1304144228327370752 2020-09-11 03:46:28 +0800 <PaoMickel> Oooooh love it. They are beginning  to eat their own!👍🌊😷

1303842446854381568 2020-09-10 07:47:18 +0800 <PaoMickel> I think most of the GOP knew. They are complicit in causing the deaths of almost 200,000 Americans. All should be put through the ringer post Jan 20th 2021. Can’t wait to watch them squirm and whine. Convinced Putin has bought them all.

1303797621073403904 2020-09-10 04:49:10 +0800 <PaoMickel> Agreed. An honourable man who cares about those under his command removed from his post by the orange moron who continues to wreak havoc. Something wrong with our system of governance.🌊😷
1303751757328048128 2020-09-10 01:46:56 +0800 <PaoMickel> Too stupid and besides he will lie, probably say it was someone else’s voice. I want to see him prosecuted and questioned under oath for as long as it takes to find him guilty of crimes against America and locked up.

1303359465882710016 2020-09-08 23:48:06 +0800 <PaoMickel> It’s time to acknowledge that if trump has another 4 years it possibly will be our last vote for any party other than the party of trump. Much work needs to be done but we have to preserve the only avenue we have to make that possible. Get rid of trump.

1302764756957192192 2020-09-07 08:24:56 +0800 <PaoMickel> Just watched Dana Bash on the Kamala Harris take on if masks would be mandated under a Biden presidency. It went the rounds with Axelrod and 2 others but Bash had to have the last word intimating Harris’s inconsistency with the Biden position. Is she trying to get trump elected?

1302640510163533825 2020-09-07 00:11:14 +0800 <PaoMickel> Is he literate? He strikes me as being as having slow brain function very hesitant and confused. 🌊😷

1300828052629282821 2020-09-02 00:09:10 +0800 <PaoMickel> Trump re-election paid by the US government? Sounds like a Trump/Miller plan for glory. Pigs 🐖

1300662027472363520 2020-09-01 13:09:27 +0800 <PaoMickel> What is amazing about killing 2 people and injuring 1? Is this the America we  have to live in now with the trump regime? Sorry but my vote is for Biden a man who knows what Law and Order means. Trump is the Lawless and Disorderly POTUS.
