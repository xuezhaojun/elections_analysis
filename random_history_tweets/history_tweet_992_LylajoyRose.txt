1341467694571212801 2020-12-23 03:36:36 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @CNN And Ossoff looks like an idiot.

1341466457570304000 2020-12-23 03:31:41 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RepMGS And you Democrats want that to be permanent. Be ware people starvation is coming.

1341460442003066883 2020-12-23 03:07:47 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @MaddowBlog So what crime is the SDNY investigating? They don‚Äôt have the right to get a warrant o. Someone without a crime.
1341458844170391552 2020-12-23 03:01:26 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @kylegriffin1 If they are doing thus without a crime then the SDNY has committed a crime and must be arrested. Curious they want the communication while Rudy is working on voter fraud. This proves voter fraud.
1341458369777815552 2020-12-23 02:59:33 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @JohnWDean What crime are they investigating or are the prosecutors fishing for evidence which is against the law.

1341350998552453122 2020-12-22 19:52:53 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RepBonnie @AyannaPressley Absolutely not. Once you take a life and it‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt self defence, you forfeit your own.
1341350821473243136 2020-12-22 19:52:11 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RepKClark @AyannaPressley Yet those sand people decided the death penalty for their victims and you don‚Äôt have a problem with that.

1338143169385394177 2020-12-13 23:26:07 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @TerranWoolley @Stephen04627315 @WalshFreedom Yes they did. And you know the only way Biden or the democrats were going to win was by cheating. But you now have a dictatorship, so enjoy the hell you helped to bring on America.
1338142759266349057 2020-12-13 23:24:29 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @NeuSummits @BulwarkOnline Look in the mirror, you have far more character deficiencies than President Trump and you just helped put a bunch of people in power that hate Christians. Congratulations.
1338142211851001862 2020-12-13 23:22:19 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @ea_fuzz Why are these people still on the air?
1338141426073313280 2020-12-13 23:19:12 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @ClayTravis That is just awful the way the airline treated this family. United needs to be boycotted and out out of business, enough is enough.
1338139023362035714 2020-12-13 23:09:39 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @JohnDePetroshow @kellyalex1024 @ClayTravis You are a failure where were you when your democrat Gods were running around without masks partying and they were grownups and yet you want a two year to behave better than a democrat adult. Heinous.
1338138457269399555 2020-12-13 23:07:24 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @JohnDePetroshow @energyburrito @ClayTravis Yes your children need to be taken away from you and given to nice honest people.
1338138303837601792 2020-12-13 23:06:47 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @JohnDePetroshow @ClayTravis While democrat politicians are partying in Restaurants and traveling around the world without masks or social distancing? Give me a break.
1338137921287671811 2020-12-13 23:05:16 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @JohnDePetroshow @ClayTravis So a two year old acts like a democrat and you are having a hissy fit?
1338137526670790658 2020-12-13 23:03:42 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @cityofcalgary @kensingtonYYC What roaming? We are in a lock down. Do try and keep up.
1338137316154470400 2020-12-13 23:02:52 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @cityofcalgary @CalgaryParking What good is that when all businesses are locked down.
1338137065217617920 2020-12-13 23:01:52 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @WalshFreedom You know the election was stolen. You have probably orchestrated the end of freedom in America. Congratulations you have destroyed not only your fellow Americans but your own family as well. Look at history, dictators get rid of those who helped topple a government first.
1338136564170326016 2020-12-13 22:59:52 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Stephen04627315 @WalshFreedom Most of those votes were fraudulent votes and you know that.

1337744488224059392 2020-12-12 21:01:54 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Purehea59120075 @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Enjoy the dictatorship that you are now supporting.
1337744318174437378 2020-12-12 21:01:14 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @kromexstylez @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity The death toll is only on the democrats when they issued executive orders forcing long term care facilities to take people who were infected with coronavirus and thousands died.  https://t.co/I3C2CfwPx2
1337743979484336128 2020-12-12 20:59:53 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity The Supreme Court just threw the American people under the bus. They should be ashamed of themselves.
1337616649726259201 2020-12-12 12:33:55 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Rosenlaw @ryanstruyk Time to get the Democrats out of government, they are out of control.
1337616390841233408 2020-12-12 12:32:53 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @ryanstruyk Thus tweet confirms voter fraud. America rise up and get these Democrats out of office.
1337616254866100224 2020-12-12 12:32:21 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @SethAbramson That‚Äôs over turning the will of the people. It will also prove voter fraud.
1337615467679154178 2020-12-12 12:29:13 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @orlandosentinel What did seeking the truth? I guess that would threaten liars.
1337605956918636546 2020-12-12 11:51:26 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RepSwalwell @GOPLeader McCarthy isn‚Äôt the one who betrayed his country, you are.

1337595711202811905 2020-12-12 11:10:43 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @w_terrence @realDonaldTrump Why aren‚Äôt you guys marching in the streets, picking up,the phones and calling, gif you started going after the democrats you can still get them out. Screaming on Twitter isn‚Äôt going to do it.
1337595310369959937 2020-12-12 11:09:07 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @robbystarbuck You guys waved the white flag a long time ago.

1337594864070918145 2020-12-12 11:07:21 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @AOC So who did this guy murder? Sorry if you murder you deserve execution.
1337594633136656384 2020-12-12 11:06:26 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @nypost Unbelievable and Biden will give fatso a top job.
1337594492174536705 2020-12-12 11:05:52 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @JaniceDean Abd he will kill even more people.  https://t.co/DfMtfVLbSH
1337594310888366081 2020-12-12 11:05:09 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @chuckwoolery Terrific. Enjoy dictatorship, you guys chose not to fight for freedom.
1337594016519520256 2020-12-12 11:03:59 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @HeyTammyBruce So where are the American people, they aren‚Äôt exactly fighting back are they.

1337593546551877634 2020-12-12 11:02:07 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @SenSchumer And freedom will end on that day.
1337593121631170560 2020-12-12 11:00:26 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @WendyRogersAZ Oh you‚Äôve been fighting, never noticed, the silence has been deafening.
1337592945600462850 2020-12-12 10:59:44 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @kylegriffin1 Your freedoms are now gone and you were so stupid you helped make it happen.
1337592670189887488 2020-12-12 10:58:38 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Acosta It‚Äôs not a bad idea.
1337592551008661504 2020-12-12 10:58:10 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @toddstarnes For breaking news on the vaccine.
1337592447640035330 2020-12-12 10:57:45 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden The kids are going to school in republicans states and the vaccine will be given out before you take office, so don‚Äôt tout it that you and Biden stopped the pandemic.
1337591934039121920 2020-12-12 10:55:42 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @JaniceDean That‚Äôs dictatorship. Do you really think Democrats are going be content with killing people in long term care? More will follow if no June stops the democrats like the American people.
1337591505469362176 2020-12-12 10:54:00 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @WendyRogersAZ What fight?
1337591434870865921 2020-12-12 10:53:43 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @jaketapper You are so stupid that you don‚Äôt realize that you Americans just lost big time. What a fool you are.
1337591067810562049 2020-12-12 10:52:16 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @SpeakerPelosi You know you democrats committed voter fraud. How did you get scouts to look the other way? Did you threaten them?
1337590682706345984 2020-12-12 10:50:44 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @EBraeden Your democracy is dead, but you are going to have to figure that out for yourself.
1337563758391042048 2020-12-12 09:03:45 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @blargains @CNN Don‚Äôt count on it.
1337563435127635968 2020-12-12 09:02:28 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @hwinkler4real Enjoy dictatorship and Biden doesn‚Äôt like Jews. Enjoy have fun.
1337563202431827968 2020-12-12 09:01:32 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @PattyArquette @ChristopherHahn @tedcruz Cruz does understand the constitution. However, you now have the dictatorship you fought so hard for. Enjoy. Now you have no rights at all.
1337562901163331584 2020-12-12 09:00:21 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @natsechobbyist @ChristopherHahn Enjoy dictatorship and enjoy telling your kids why you fought so hard to get rid of their rights.

1337561046240784385 2020-12-12 08:52:58 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @dbrossman @CNN Guess you will enjoy inflicting hell on your neighbours.

1337558825180700673 2020-12-12 08:44:09 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @ACTBrigitte Why are you so surprised? Could have told you that.
1337558658738077697 2020-12-12 08:43:29 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Qris_P @danhill2011 @cydruc Boy you just don‚Äôt get it. Well stay as naive as long as possible and get plenty of rest.

1337557469556482049 2020-12-12 08:38:46 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @tracybeanz @WendyRogersAZ You haven‚Äôt even fought in any battles, you guys just sat on your assets and did absolutely nothing to stop the Democrats and now you have lost everything.
1337557165838495746 2020-12-12 08:37:33 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Well now you get to hook up with your Chinese girlfriend. Enjoy.
1337556981314306048 2020-12-12 08:36:49 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @julieroginsky If congress decides Trump wins.

1337556533706571776 2020-12-12 08:35:02 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @clairecmc @PreetBharara And you will be stripping every American of their rights, enjoy.
1337555634124804096 2020-12-12 08:31:28 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @realDonaldTrump Well they didn‚Äôt they folded like a tent. Get yourself and your family out of the US now and get to safety. Canada won‚Äôt be safe. Pull as much of your savings that you can out of your accounts and leave America.
1337555128417566721 2020-12-12 08:29:27 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @ChristianWalk1r @HerschelWalker Just like Trump‚Äôs base who sat in there asses and did nothing except complain.

1337554694298734592 2020-12-12 08:27:44 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @SenWhitehouse You Democrats are the ones who use dark money.
1337554509246001153 2020-12-12 08:27:00 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @GlobalCalgary How many are not vivid but are the flu instead Hinshaw.
1337554365893132289 2020-12-12 08:26:26 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @CNN Hell is coming.
1337554154638647296 2020-12-12 08:25:35 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @LeahR77 That might be your only hope. You guys needed to organize, march, sue and raise holy hell and all you guys did was sit on your asses and do nothing. Your rights are now gone.
1337552322650488833 2020-12-12 08:18:18 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @WendyRogersAZ Could have told you that was going to happen. Enjoy your dictatorship. You guys were in a war and you guys lost without even firing a shot.
1337551996560142336 2020-12-12 08:17:01 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @danhill2011 @cydruc Apparently it‚Äôs ok for you Americans because you guys just sat on your asses and did nothing to stop the Democrats. Explain that to your kids.
1337551653906485249 2020-12-12 08:15:39 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RashidaTlaib Have fun going after your fellow Americans and making their lives a living hell.
1337545078152151040 2020-12-12 07:49:31 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @AndrewYang No people will blame everything on the Democrats.
1337544903350312961 2020-12-12 07:48:49 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @DuncanIsRight @ChristianWalk1r You know that‚Äôs not true.
1337544806013157378 2020-12-12 07:48:26 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @marklevinshow What makes you think that‚Äôs going to work. You are now in a dictatorship, no one listened and no one cared. Get yourself and your family out of America and find some place safe to live before it is too late.
1337542721020391425 2020-12-12 07:40:09 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @ChristianWalk1r That didn‚Äôt surprise me at all. Evil times are upon us.

1337411293423136771 2020-12-11 22:57:54 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @robbystarbuck @TulsiGabbard I agree with the bill as well. Boys do not need to play with girls and ruin their futures, it‚Äôs just plain wrong. Teach the kids to be happy with who they are and sports is not the end all to be all in most people‚Äôs lives.
1337243662040793088 2020-12-11 11:51:48 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @DailyCaller @tedcruz That is the correct thing to do for women.

1337186341587578881 2020-12-11 08:04:02 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @CNN So the vaccine has to wear a mask too?
1337177639136632832 2020-12-11 07:29:27 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @donnabrazile @AmbassadorRice So a pathological liar is going to be apart of the coronavirus task force. Not a good choice.

Do you really want the Democrats in power or do you march and demand the election be over turned. Voter fraud.

1333241486087913472 2020-11-30 10:48:35 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @AlexVita9 @ksorbs Masks didn‚Äôt become the great coronavirus cure until Pelosi slapped one on her dry old hide and then the mainstream media  jumped on mask wearing along with left leaning governments. Doctors for months said masks didn‚Äôt worked a d then over night they changed Pelosi masked up.
1333240655502483456 2020-11-30 10:45:17 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @captiveww @ksorbs News flash, the coronavirus  germs are just as small as oxygen molecules. Nothing gets stopped especially if you are breathing.
1333240052067962880 2020-11-30 10:42:53 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @ksorbs You‚Äôd think we would learn to think for ourselves after Nazis and the German sheeple who went along with hating the Jews because the news media told them to hate Jews. Frightening.
1333237690595086337 2020-11-30 10:33:30 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Imminentpoop @ABC @MarthaRaddatz Yeah right.

1333234230235590657 2020-11-30 10:19:45 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @prairiemum88 @RachelNotley If you can breath through a mask you can get covid which is the same size as oxygen molecules.

1333231089612066816 2020-11-30 10:07:16 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @hhwyfe @NBeesax @GlobalCalgary Actually it does.

1333229211599847424 2020-11-30 09:59:48 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @TheDemocrats And you have to live in the constituencies where the run off elections are occurring.

1333226353290723329 2020-11-30 09:48:27 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @eren_salyer @KGETnews Yeah actually Jill‚Äôs ex has spoken out about her affair with Joe Biden and Melanie did the nude pictures when she was young.  If Jill tried doing any nudes at any age people would barf when they looked them.
1333225557434064896 2020-11-30 09:45:17 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @DJT_Washington @catturd2 @realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo @FoxNews The rich family sued Fox over Hannity‚Äôs story and Fox just settled with the family. Makes you wonder if the family was in on Seth‚Äôs death but the lawsuit is why Hannity had to stop.
1333222565397970945 2020-11-30 09:33:24 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @DJT_Washington @catturd2 @realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo @FoxNews I was mad at their coverage but I wasn‚Äôt surprised by it because Fox used all lefty‚Äôs to cover the election, they didn‚Äôt disappoint. I still watch Tucker, Hannity, Ingram, Levin, Watters, Piero and Gutfeld. Just like always did and pretty well ignored everyone else.
1333220242902794242 2020-11-30 09:24:10 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @DJT_Washington @catturd2 @realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo @FoxNews I guess what confuses me is Fox has always said they were fair and balanced and they always had their left leaning shows and their right leaning shows at night and they have been doing this since they started up. I watched the right wing shows and ignored everything else.
1333218934309277696 2020-11-30 09:18:58 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @DJT_Washington @catturd2 @realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo @FoxNews And Fox actually hasn‚Äôt gone way left. The shows that were left still are and get ignored.
1333218609481482240 2020-11-30 09:17:41 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @DJT_Washington @catturd2 @realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo @FoxNews Fox always had Trump haters , that‚Äôs nothing new, calling Arizona early would not have changed any votes and because a wife spewed didn‚Äôt mean Fox did anything because no one watched the left leaning shows anyways. Their ratings were always low. The right wing shows had ratings.

1333214981869821953 2020-11-30 09:03:16 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @hhwyfe @NBeesax @GlobalCalgary No she hasn‚Äôt. Ling term care was the last to be picked down and the first to open up and that was done on Hinshaw‚Äôs instructions.
1333214746082832385 2020-11-30 09:02:20 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RachelNotley Thank you for confirming you want a lockdown which would destroy Albertans province wide along with the economy. Your cure is worse than the virus.

1333205253748006913 2020-11-30 08:24:36 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @deenie7940 Of course they are.
1333203204788523008 2020-11-30 08:16:28 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @AriFleischer Because the guys hitting him are bigger than he is.

1333201376147431425 2020-11-30 08:09:12 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @DJT_Washington @catturd2 @realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo @FoxNews The consequences is they no longer have jobs. Why did it take you guys so long to figure out that Fox News had lefty‚Äôs working for them, I figured them out the first month after getting Fox. I just watched the shows I liked on Fox and ignored the rest. No big deal.
1333200641640960000 2020-11-30 08:06:17 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RachelNotley Your plan would bankrupt Alberta.
1333199020357865472 2020-11-30 07:59:50 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @hhwyfe @GlobalCalgary Ask Notley and Rutherford they both cut funding to long term care.

1333196020012916739 2020-11-30 07:47:55 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @oilersdave1 @CMOH_Alberta Then you watch all of the small business owners lose everything they have trying to keep someone like you from getting a virus that can be treated if Hinshaw would allow life saving medicine to be used.
1333195121915949056 2020-11-30 07:44:21 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @CMOH_Alberta @jkenney Why don‚Äôt you let the doctors treat the people with all available coronavirus treatments and open up Alberta.
1333194839714787328 2020-11-30 07:43:14 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @MariaTCardona Oh by the way, Biden will take a paycheck and huge payoffs fro foreign governments and do their will not America‚Äôs will. President Trump didn‚Äôt do any of those things and President Trump donated his paycheck to charity.
1333194187764686848 2020-11-30 07:40:38 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @MariaTCardona Boy you can‚Äôt even keep with your own lies, you guys are the ones who call everyone you hate racist not President Trump.
1333193775695286272 2020-11-30 07:39:00 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @ReverendWarnock Your into anything together with anybody except yourself.

1333192798103715842 2020-11-30 07:35:07 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @intheMatrixxx This man needs to be thrown out of America like his own country Hungary threw Soros out, after you appropriate all of his assets to pay for all of the burned down and destroyed businesses.
1333191990255644674 2020-11-30 07:31:54 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @MariaTCardona @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris If Democrats get all three houses, you won‚Äôt have long to wait to find out, then you will be in a world of hurt and regrets.
1333191588529377281 2020-11-30 07:30:18 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @DJT_Washington @catturd2 @realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo @FoxNews Yeah you can do that. I watched what the President had to say this morning about his case of voter fraud. It was a very good interview. Blanketing hating everyone that is now on a particular channel is what the Democrats do, are you now following the democrat handbook of hate?
1333190334390562817 2020-11-30 07:25:19 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @rgoalierob @IlhanMN Everyone, except for Alberta unfortunately, pays for healthcare. So where is the money going to come from?
1333190058040455171 2020-11-30 07:24:13 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @eren_salyer @KGETnews Of course you do, Jill fooled around in her then husband because she believed Joe was going to make her a rich woman, which in a way he did. Now Jill will be First Lady because of fraud which, I guess, best describes Jill, she‚Äôs a fraud in every sense of the word.
1333188893043134467 2020-11-30 07:19:36 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @mgtower64 @RachelNotley Think about this one. The coronavirus is the same size as oxygen molecules and you breath through those masks. Now tell me what stops the coronavirus?

1333074846985584641 2020-11-29 23:46:25 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @kaitlancollins Because anyone with half a brain knows there‚Äôs massive voter fraud.

1333072232227082241 2020-11-29 23:36:02 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Trump_Team_1_NV It is a strange spat isn‚Äôt it.
1333070422300975105 2020-11-29 23:28:50 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Trump_Team_1_NV I can still see Catturd on Parlor and asked him there why he blocked me, hasn‚Äôt answered me and hasn‚Äôt blocked me. I took down the original question because I did make a mistake in the wording.
1333070024202801154 2020-11-29 23:27:15 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Trump_Team_1_NV I was blocked by catturd.  Asked him a question didn‚Äôt word it the best way, but Catturd was mad thaT President Trump had tweeted he was on Maria Bartiromo‚Äôs show this morning. I asked if we are to get mad at President Trump now because he‚Äôs on Fox giving an interview.
1333067754958516224 2020-11-29 23:18:14 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @TaylerUSA @LWilsonDarlene To the Democrats Diamond and Silk are white supremacists just like Candace Owens.

But President Trump is on Maria Bartoloma this morning abd now it seems like you are all mad at him for doing that. Are we supposed to be so full of hate that we can‚Äôt listen to Trump anymore because he‚Äôs on Fox. I‚Äôm not a democrat, they paint everyone same
1333063358384259073 2020-11-29 23:00:46 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @DeanBrowningPA @KevinBooker212 Because he doesn‚Äôt like anyone else but himself.

Isn‚Äôt that how Democrats behave by hating everyone who doesn‚Äôt think like they do? Watch the President on Fox thus morning I dare you to. Catturd blocked me for asking the same question. Are we about hate?
1333055890577002502 2020-11-29 22:31:05 +0800 <LylajoyRose> Catturd just blocked for asking a question. Isn‚Äôt that what Democrats do?

1332995565534187520 2020-11-29 18:31:23 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @MaxGail @BillKristol They went after Flynn because he would not back Hillary. Even the FBI came out publicly and said he didn‚Äôt lie. Flynn pled guilty because he was bankrupt and his wife and Son were being threatened. Flynn would have Ben left alone if he had supported Hillary?
1332993456147365888 2020-11-29 18:23:00 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @MaxGail @BillKristol Open up your eyes and unstop your ears and take a long look around because it is not propaganda, just step out of line once Mr. Gail and see how fast you are pounced on attacked and death threatened for not towing the democrat and left way of thinking.

Besides the Democrats and the left want to end freedom of speech for everyone they disagree with. What the left doesn‚Äôt realize is they are ending freedom of speech for themselves as well.

1332840509983780864 2020-11-29 08:15:15 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @LLinWood @BrianKempGA You need to do that 24/7 until the election fraud is over turned.
1332833255385493504 2020-11-29 07:46:25 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @carlbernstein All you do is lie. Maybe we need to revisit Watergate.

1332820299604103168 2020-11-29 06:54:56 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @SportsCenter @SECNetwork Not very classy woman.

1331435812219588613 2020-11-25 11:13:29 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RachelNotley So you do want a total lockdown and you don‚Äôt give a da,n about Albertans, you just want them under total control. Thank goodness you aren‚Äôt in charge.

The Last Supper was Jesus celebrating the Passover and Jesus give us Communion and thus was the night before His crucifixion, where Jesus died on the cross to save us all from our sins.

Trump‚Äôs legal team made a huge mistake by giving a press conference and all they have are talking heads and no other proof at this point in time. They have seen this kind and stuff that goes nowhere for decades.
1331242228786708480 2020-11-24 22:24:15 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @catturd2 @American1299 They aren‚Äôt throwing Trump under the bus they are throwing the courts under the bus.

1331102216145387520 2020-11-24 13:07:53 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @nypost What medications was she given?
1331101523154149377 2020-11-24 13:05:08 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @CNN While he goes. Out and meets with his family and has thanksgiving, just like a typical democrat authoritarian.
1331101124170944512 2020-11-24 13:03:33 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @CNN So they all got sick that got together which was 12 people who turned around and gave it to 3 other family members, but the mother who just got out of the hospital is isolating. Doesn‚Äôt make sense.
1331092380812935169 2020-11-24 12:28:48 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @ananavarro @JoeBiden Enjoy dictatorship, the American people will not forget your part in destroying democracy in America.

1331080669980549123 2020-11-24 11:42:16 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @influx_Divine Unfortunately the Democrats own the courts, President Trump won‚Äôt be in charge and Democrats want to destroy Trump and family because they stood up against the Democrats while you guys slowly fiddled away your rights by doing nothing and staying silent.

1331042283626479620 2020-11-24 09:09:44 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @grizatlcp @MattLeinartQB The democrats were the ones who didn‚Äôt want to do anything and they still don‚Äôt, and democrats were the ones who killed thousands in long term care.  https://t.co/cDYqm67Y5F

1331039121804992513 2020-11-24 08:57:10 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @EricLevitz @brianefallon So Schumer bullied a senior, that‚Äôs great, kill them in long term care and then bully the rest and this was because she hugged Graham.  https://t.co/Xoq6y8lSYz

1331038088101994497 2020-11-24 08:53:04 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @jordanhk92 @SenBillCassidy Oh yeah that‚Äôs brilliant, give the Democrats all three houses, they pack the Supreme Court who will then strip you of all of your rights and end democracy in America. You idiots are becoming as stupid as Democrats.
1331037659414728707 2020-11-24 08:51:22 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @LisaRPrice2 @SenBillCassidy @Gloria4Educ Democrats issued executive orders forcing long term care facilities to take people who were infected with coronavirus and thousands died. Research this yourself and you will find out who has actually killed thousands. Here‚Äôs a start.  https://t.co/jdShmwcmO4
1331037133260300289 2020-11-24 08:49:16 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Chicago1Ray Where‚Äôs the evidence, which would help the current court cases now. Why is Ms. Powell waiting two weeks? Why didn‚Äôt she share with the rest of the team? What Ms. Powell claims she has would have put it over the top in all of the states, why two weeks? Ask questions always.
1331036512603947009 2020-11-24 08:46:48 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @jcasper11 @catturd2 That‚Äôs who‚Äôs benefiting from this boycott. Are the liars. What gets me is you just discovered Fox had left leaning people on it‚Äôs station, I figured out who was who within a month and picked the shows and I wanted to watch and I‚Äôm behind Tucker all the way.
1331035852823117825 2020-11-24 08:44:11 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @CallMeEsQ @catturd2 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @LouDobbs So now do you hate President Trump for firing Ms. Powell? Tucker was dead on right to ask Powell for evidence and she blew up at him and I have the feeling Giuliani asked for the same evidence and she blew up at him. The court cases are now, why is Powell waiting 2 weeks?
1331021937225601024 2020-11-24 07:48:53 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @rickhenry1775 @XArmandKleinX Now you want to act?

1330968194069065729 2020-11-24 04:15:20 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @lesliejmarshall @RealJamesWoods Why not? The criminal element of the Black community has nothing to be afraid of, because the democrats have the need to hide their racism and thuggery helps the democrats to get what they want, a terrorized population that the democrats can control, through dictatorship.
1330967513283194880 2020-11-24 04:12:38 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RealJamesWoods It will get worse now that the criminals know they can do anything they want to. This thanks to the democrats and yet people still voted for them. There are a lot of really stupid people out there.
1330967156150865920 2020-11-24 04:11:12 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @NYGovCuomo You killed thousands in long term care, now you want to bankrupt and financially destroy your victim‚Äôs families, you are nothing but a cold ass thug.  https://t.co/1l8Zmm11Dh

1330867731646693378 2020-11-23 21:36:08 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RachelNotley Why were the doctors saying that masks didn‚Äôt work for minted until Pelosi slapped one on her face and then all of a sudden the masks work. That is not science.

1330763819316961281 2020-11-23 14:43:13 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @catturd2 I hope Ms. Powell can back everything she has been saying, but Trump and Giuliani don‚Äôt kick people out of their orbit on a whim.

1330742361731727362 2020-11-23 13:17:57 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @CNN Yet if churches are allowed to open up, they aren‚Äôt allowed to sing or do much of anything but if you are a stupid ass liberal you have different rules. Disgusting.

1329897970624413697 2020-11-21 05:22:39 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @alexweprin Time to raise holy hell and boycott Hollywood in mass.
1329897641942024193 2020-11-21 05:21:20 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @HRipley7 @seanhannity Cuomo has no class. Boycott Hollywood
1329897498614267904 2020-11-21 05:20:46 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @hardcor_saiyan @seanhannity Time for America to raise holy hell against Cuomo and boycott all things Hollywood and watch old reruns from the days when Hollywood actually had a certain amount of morals.
1329897148301754373 2020-11-21 05:19:23 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @seanhannity Definitely a reason to boycott Hollywood. I vote we watch old reruns and watch people who actually had morals and hated people who killed seniors by the thousands. Now‚Äôs the time to raise holy hell everyone.  https://t.co/g0isJFz2Vt

1329794234656854016 2020-11-20 22:30:26 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @AmyKremer @SidneyPowell1 Since when?
1329794031962918913 2020-11-20 22:29:38 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Scaramucci Panicked?
1329793778748583938 2020-11-20 22:28:37 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @catturd2 Turds are extremely powerful.
1329789001834713089 2020-11-20 22:09:38 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @mollyday15 Tucker was right to ask.
1329788105197453315 2020-11-20 22:06:05 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @BoSnerdley Tucker asked for some sort of evidence from Powell. If you throw out a huge bombshell you have to stairs a little bit if what you have.
1329787745317707776 2020-11-20 22:04:39 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @DennisseLisseth No he didn‚Äôt. Powell can give a little bit of what she has and should.
1329787587418939400 2020-11-20 22:04:01 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @SouthArthur Powell didn‚Äôt even say she has a server. Powell didn‚Äôt say she had evidence like her colleagues and that is disquieting. As Tucker says he hopes she does have evidence.
1329784907866931201 2020-11-20 21:53:22 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @SouthArthur Guilliani and the rest told us what they had to back up their case without tipping their hand. Powell never did.
1329784598058868736 2020-11-20 21:52:09 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @JDRucker @FoxNews Just on Powell‚Äôs claim, not anybody else‚Äôs because everyone else gave a  little bit of evidence.  If Powell had evidence she would have said she did but couldn‚Äôt share until it goes to court, why didn‚Äôt she?
1329784159410159616 2020-11-20 21:50:24 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @SouthArthur No he‚Äôs not. Tucker is doing his job. Powell needs to give the American people something if she should not have said anything at all, that‚Äôs his it works.
1329783719784194049 2020-11-20 21:48:39 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @TheUnsilentMaj3 @wvufanagent99 @SidneyPowell1 Tucker had the right to ask for evidence. Giuliani gave us a little bit, Powell has given nothing.
1329783399867813890 2020-11-20 21:47:23 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @SexCounseling @TuckerCarlson @SidneyPowell1 Tucker had the right to ask and why hasn‚Äôt anybody else seen any evidence either? It‚Äôs a legitimate question and Powell needs to answer. Powell does not have to give all she has is anything but a little bit would help.
1329782873423970307 2020-11-20 21:45:17 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @DailyCaller That doesn‚Äôt look you‚Äôd for Powell does it? If you have proof then shoe done over it like Gulliani did.
1329781378154590208 2020-11-20 21:39:21 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @TheMikeClayton8 @DJT_Washington Sounds like a great idea.

1329632811532226561 2020-11-20 11:49:00 +0800 <LylajoyRose> Can anyone name one democrat or liberal who has said, do a complete audit on all ballots cast, and count them by hand?
1329632313521569792 2020-11-20 11:47:01 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @CNN Thus us a man that is panicking out if him mind such as it is.
1329632040514318339 2020-11-20 11:45:56 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @WalshFreedom Mitt Romney is a pathological liar like your are so it‚Äôs completely toothless.
1329623552673255424 2020-11-20 11:12:12 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @BobIverach The reporter after Kristin Fisher debunked her completely.

1329622436275396610 2020-11-20 11:07:46 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @SenJeffMerkley But you Democrats have never come to the table.  https://t.co/slLtWmaWpS

1329621313376247808 2020-11-20 11:03:18 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @BobIverach If Powell doesn‚Äôt have proof her career is over and out and Tucker is right to ask about proof.
1329621104923529216 2020-11-20 11:02:29 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @MajorPatriot @BobIverach Tucker was still number one. Stop acting like a democrat.
1329620967845367808 2020-11-20 11:01:56 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RachelNotley They didn‚Äôt open up schools for almost six months so why are the costs mounting? They were still getting money, where did the money go?

1329618040908959744 2020-11-20 10:50:18 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @BobIverach I don‚Äôt know why they have Kristen Fisher do the White House all she did was lie, the next reporter totally debunked everything she said.

1329539155261485056 2020-11-20 05:36:50 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @tomselliott This is the guy Americans chose to lead them? My advice is to find as much voter fraud you can and get this guy out before he even realizes something happened.
1329503581783740416 2020-11-20 03:15:29 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @maggieNYT You‚Äôre needing to use more deodorant than normal aren‚Äôt you.
1329503223087030274 2020-11-20 03:14:04 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @samstein You do as well.
1329502758760693761 2020-11-20 03:12:13 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN Thank you for confirming voter fraud.

1329501892334866432 2020-11-20 03:08:46 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @WalshFreedom Boy are you panicking. Is Trump‚Äôs legal team getting to close?
1329499116582227969 2020-11-20 02:57:44 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @jaketapper You Democrats did that when you committed voter fraud.
1329498851460321280 2020-11-20 02:56:41 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Jim_Jordan Because they know voter fraud occurred.
1329498773676982272 2020-11-20 02:56:23 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @nypost While they travel and get together with family.
1329498631548747776 2020-11-20 02:55:49 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RepGutierrez Looks like you taught them voter fraud real well.
1329498474635661312 2020-11-20 02:55:11 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @NewYorkStateAG You make so much money your gesture is cosmetic only.
1329498267789398016 2020-11-20 02:54:22 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @thebradfordfile @catturd2 Well Biden is on video saying that the democrat party had a huge voter fraud network in place. Someone needs to find away to get that to Trump‚Äôs legal team and out Biden under oath, along with Obama.
1329497845813047297 2020-11-20 02:52:41 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @cenkuygur Now tell the truth if you remember how to do that.

1329233739507924993 2020-11-19 09:23:14 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RepDonBeyer You Democrats filibustered an aud bill in the senate to prevent it from being passed and then blame it on the republicans.

1329232900802297863 2020-11-19 09:19:54 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @BernieSanders A whole raft of lies again from a card caring communist who honeymooned in Russia.
1329213776583745537 2020-11-19 08:03:54 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RepThomasMassie What an awful jerk. Dictatorship handbook, keep everyone in extreme poverty and you stay in power, you also stop educating the masses, all they get is your propaganda.
1329213406113513473 2020-11-19 08:02:26 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @LiegeoisCathy @ReverendWarnock Bet you can‚Äôt wait to lose all your freedoms.

1329058778197549063 2020-11-18 21:48:00 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @SenQuezada29 @RashidaTlaib This story is so false. Twice as many people are shot by police than black people. In most of the cases it was stop defence.  The exception is George Floyd. Criminals want the police gone so they can continue to be criminals and they are all races.

1328474772926132224 2020-11-17 07:07:22 +0800 <LylajoyRose> They just found uncounted ballots for Trump in Georgia. Not sure how many. Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if it gives Georgia to Trump.

Worried he‚Äôs finding the voter fraud that you guys used to win the election?
1328354331217723393 2020-11-16 23:08:46 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @marklevinshow Strange isn‚Äôt it. They would rather kill people than announce they have a vaccine.

1327608082747117568 2020-11-14 21:43:27 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @samanthamarika1 Because people keep thinking if they go down the same old path they will get a different outcome and that never happens until real change comes from the electorate.

1325670152977854464 2020-11-09 13:22:48 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @ACTBrigitte Fox hasn‚Äôt changed all that much since I started watching them, but they really botched the election by having only the left doing the election, they all act like lemmings and will all run off the cliff together. I watch,  Levin, the next revolution, Tucker, Hannity, Ingram, Greg

1325666745374265345 2020-11-09 13:09:16 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @nypost They need to stop laying the victim, they are committing voter fraud.

1325516118270767104 2020-11-09 03:10:44 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RachelNotley They are covered by disaster relief.  Insurance companies need to step and pay for everything they agreed to cover.
1325514344398876673 2020-11-09 03:03:41 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @brianstelter Now tell the truth if you remember how.

1325469985636970497 2020-11-09 00:07:25 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RachelNotley @jkenney You have the dammed nerve to ask for another lockdown that will destroy lives without condemning the Biden supporters celebrating? You and those doctors are horrible hypocrites. Open up the province and replace these liberal doctors.
1325468740956246016 2020-11-09 00:02:28 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RachelNotley Don‚Äôt worry it will happen but the province needs to open up all the way. Except for long term care.

1324075567692476417 2020-11-05 03:46:30 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @stabenow In other words voter fraud is working well.

1324074697235951616 2020-11-05 03:43:02 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @UncleCornPop @Cernovich You have to do a hell of a lot more than vote to have saved your democracy. You guys didn‚Äôt do that did you. You still aren‚Äôt.
1324073998771089408 2020-11-05 03:40:16 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @MoveOn Biden will be removed as President using the 25th amendment and Harris will be president and hell will be visited on the land. So enjoy you helped out people in office who hate you for the colour of your skin. Brilliant.
1324073364521062400 2020-11-05 03:37:44 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @UncleCornPop @Cernovich Doesn‚Äôt really matter does it. No one got off their collective asses to fight back and you still won‚Äôt. Welcome to the dictatorship your silence has won for you.
1324072702148182016 2020-11-05 03:35:06 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @thechrisbuskirk @SebGorka Sharpies never work for anything. What were you guys thinking when you used them?
1324072381946556417 2020-11-05 03:33:50 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @paulkrugman Actually you idiots just out a racist and an anti semite in office along with other people who are anti Semitic. You were so busy lying for these people you actually ended up cooking your own goose.
1324071512454787072 2020-11-05 03:30:23 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @benshapiro @RichardGrenell They all win and you couldn‚Äôt wait to join them.
1324071321244893185 2020-11-05 03:29:37 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @thechrisbuskirk @SebGorka What good would that do? Trunk needs to get himself and his family out of North America as quick as possible and save their lives. No one ever stood up with them and now you are in a dictatorship. How did the silence thing work out for you?
1324070585941458944 2020-11-05 03:26:42 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @AlbertaFFA @RachelNotley Do you really think she gives a damned about any of you? If the NDP gets back in she will won‚Äôt even acknowledge you exist as she destroys Alberta. But please don‚Äôt Poe up your eyes and actually check out everything she spews.
1324069960683974656 2020-11-05 03:24:13 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @dbongino It‚Äôs finished.

1324069439722020865 2020-11-05 03:22:09 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @SenGillibrand Yes the voter fraud machine Biden bragged about is working great for Democrats.

1324067421192253440 2020-11-05 03:14:07 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @KimStrassel If they are saying that then they know voter fraud is I place but no one cares.

1324066661075279872 2020-11-05 03:11:06 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @seanhannity It will get worse. President Trump isn‚Äôt going to win and America is no longer a safe place for you abd your family. Get out while you can a d find a safe haven as far away as you can.
1324066275195117569 2020-11-05 03:09:34 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @AbbyJohnson Who care won‚Äôt make any difference the dying will continue.
1324065765427875840 2020-11-05 03:07:33 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @AntonioSabatoJr They will go up against a democrat appointed Judge that will rule in favour of the democrat party and. who knows what the Supreme Court will do. Take your family and leave the US it won‚Äôt be safe anymore. Canada won‚Äôt be safe either.
1324065348702728192 2020-11-05 03:05:53 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @realDonaldTrump @catturd2 Yep and you will suddenly find yourself out of the Whitehouse. Leave as soon as you can and save yourself and your family and get as far away from America as you can. You tried and no one gave a damn enough to fight back. If you and your family stays you will be destroyed.
1324064768106270720 2020-11-05 03:03:35 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @ttocs35 @BobIverach Of course they were but do you see anyone on the streets raising holy hell ti stop voter fraud. It‚Äôs the silent majority for a reason. Trump as lost and it is only a matter of time before he is killed along with his family.
1324064287485120513 2020-11-05 03:01:40 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Project_Veritas Don‚Äôt bother, won‚Äôt make a damned big of difference. You are catering to people who sit on their collective asses and do absolutely nothing. Save yourselves you are now in a dictatorship. The senate won‚Äôt save you they will all roll over and play did like they always do.
1324063784206434306 2020-11-05 02:59:40 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @GarysheffieldJr @catturd2 Because it was cancelled and they probably cancelled thousands of votes so Biden could get the state.
1324025572998086656 2020-11-05 00:27:50 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RubinReport @BlazeTV Nope.

1324013922937004032 2020-11-04 23:41:32 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @DLoesch @VirginiaNeill1 Won‚Äôt happen. You are about to lose your 2nd amendment rights. How is silence working out for everyone?

1323969421690298368 2020-11-04 20:44:42 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @LBC @mrjamesob It was two o‚Äôclock in the morning and polls close at 7 pm. Democrats have tried to bring in unexplained new ballots after voting before. People marched and stopped it in Florida in 2918.
1323969087597281281 2020-11-04 20:43:23 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @PoliticalShort @RealSaavedra Per Alveda King Democrat poll workers are accepting unsigned ballots, they are telling people they don‚Äôt have to sign the ballots. That‚Äôs voter fraud. Time to rise up and stop the Democrats.
1323968525229174784 2020-11-04 20:41:09 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @TVNewsHQ @GriffJenkins Or voter fraud will. Democrats are accepting and counting ballots without signatures.
1323968013112991744 2020-11-04 20:39:07 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @peterclik @catturd2 Looks ver suspicious
1323967932209135619 2020-11-04 20:38:47 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @WvTrump @catturd2 @bennyjohnson Democrats are accepting unsigned ballots. Per Alveda King her friend was tons they didn‚Äôt have to sign their ballot or show ID. Voter fraud is occurring as we tweet and must be stopped. Stop being silent.
1323967539626434560 2020-11-04 20:37:14 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @nowthisnews @RashidaTlaib @AOC @IlhanMN @AyannaPressley @CoriBush @JamaalBowmanNY The people who voted for the squad should be ashamed of themselves.
1323967420692750337 2020-11-04 20:36:45 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RashidaTlaib Why are there ballots being accepted unsigned? Poll workers are yelling people they don‚Äôt have to sign the ballots. Clearly it‚Äôs voter fraud.
1323967208544825345 2020-11-04 20:35:55 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @LBC @NickFerrariLBC Creep
1323966930487660544 2020-11-04 20:34:49 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @AntonioSabatoJr No you don‚Äôt, the cheating by Democrats is already occurring. They are accepting unsigned Ballots per Alveda King.
1323966559266787328 2020-11-04 20:33:20 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @jackmjenkins @MoveOn But are they cheating?
1323966460083937281 2020-11-04 20:32:56 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @catturd2 So where is everyone. The streets should be full of a angry Americans do everything they can to stop the voter fraud. Per Elveda King Democrats have excepting votes without signatures. A democrat poll worker told Elveda‚Äôs friend he didn‚Äôt have to sign the ballot. ALARM BELLS.
1323965788198326274 2020-11-04 20:30:16 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @catturd2 And somehow the lead evaporated over night in Wisconsin and now favours Biden and thus after Democrats sat in counting ballots for hours.
1323965533046272001 2020-11-04 20:29:15 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @marklevinshow @catturd2 Looks like voter fraud is occurring. Go and talk to Alveda King she has witnessed it first hand.
1323965347330838530 2020-11-04 20:28:31 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @ryanmatsumoto1 Voter fraud is occurring already, Alveda King is confirming that, Democrats are telling people they don‚Äôt have to sign ballots and people do. Time to listen to the alarm bells and stop the Democrats.
1323964029811843074 2020-11-04 20:23:17 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @ReaganBattalion @BonginoReport @JoyAnnReid Joy Reid is also homophobic as well, she keeps her job because she is will to spew the horrible lies if the left. The lies that is destroying the country.
1323963630396694528 2020-11-04 20:21:42 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @LBC This guy needs to be thrown out and out under criminal investigation.
1323963112211410946 2020-11-04 20:19:38 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Cernovich That in itself is voter fraud.
1323962979012915200 2020-11-04 20:19:06 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @LibertarianBlue @BonginoReport Time to march against the Democrats. You know Democrats will cheat and must be stopped. The leaders of Pennsylvania are already confirming voter fraud with their rhetoric.
1323962600086884352 2020-11-04 20:17:36 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @tomselliott @DonnyDeutsch @JoeNBC @JamesCarville Time for honest and freedom loving Americans to rise up against the Democrats and stop them from committing voter fraud.

1323962108271230977 2020-11-04 20:15:39 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @christina_bobb @realDonaldTrump It is time for freedom loving and honest Americans to rise up against the Democrats and out a stop to Democrats dishonesty.
1323892830205403138 2020-11-04 15:40:22 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @benshapiro He is leading in all of those states and they needed an extension where no other stated needed it and have their ballots counted including California who sent out how many mail in ballots? Very suspicious. Very suspicious.
1323892265140461568 2020-11-04 15:38:07 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @FoxNews Stop bring outraged over what President Trump said. You know Democrats have committed voter fraud in the past and 2018 in Florida I believe it was broward, county, Patriots showed up and stopped new ballots from entering the building. Ballots that Democrats miraculously found.
1323891513848291328 2020-11-04 15:35:08 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @MarkDice @catturd2 Patriots now is the time to march on these states and stop the voter fraud and make sure Democrats can‚Äôt bring in new ballots.
1323883999601717249 2020-11-04 15:05:16 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @CNN Why could every other state count all of their ballots by tonight? This smells.
1323882843928342529 2020-11-04 15:00:41 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @VanJones68 Boy you do a lot of lying don‚Äôt you.

1323881100486193153 2020-11-04 14:53:45 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @thebradfordfile @catturd2 They want to commit voter fraud and Justice Roberts ruled in favour of voter fraud. Roberts must be impeached.

1323874455429410817 2020-11-04 14:27:21 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RepMGS But you Democrats will do everything you can to commit voter fraud. JFK won because the dead voted for him per CNN.
1323874022124187648 2020-11-04 14:25:37 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RealEricCarmen @catturd2 @FoxNews @newsmax So they can find more votes. In other wards voter fraud.

1323873745543421952 2020-11-04 14:24:31 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @EmeraldRobinson @catturd2 Then there‚Äôs voter fraud by the Democrats.
1323873637464600576 2020-11-04 14:24:06 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @catturd2 Voter fraud is going to happen if struts don‚Äôt show up to supervise the counting.

1323873166339448832 2020-11-04 14:22:13 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @lsferguson They are looking to commit voter fraud. Time for patriots ti get their eyes on the counting. Fraud cannot happen when many people are watching.
1323872910872903680 2020-11-04 14:21:12 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RonnieLouise2 @KathyAd17344699 They should all be ashamed of themselves.
1323872764919377921 2020-11-04 14:20:38 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @ImLookgBackAtU @grykon This after Fox said the Pelosi was still going to be speaker of the house earlier tonight.
1323872549923553281 2020-11-04 14:19:46 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @catturd2 @JJDJ1187 What about the senate?
1323872295346003969 2020-11-04 14:18:46 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @mchooyah @RichardGrenell Democrats will find a way to commit voter fraud in the outstanding states and must be stopped. Fraud cannot happen if many eyes show up to watch.
1323871741995753472 2020-11-04 14:16:34 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @donnabrazile Except you Democrats are working in voter fraud in the out standing states which is why you Democrats wanted the deadlines extended way past tonight. Heinous. Patriots please stop the Democrats from committing voter fraud.
1323871411035758592 2020-11-04 14:15:15 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RichardGrenell @catturd2 There will be a lot of voter fraud going on in these unless Patriots show up by the thousands and prevent it from happening.
1323869830550712321 2020-11-04 14:08:58 +0800 <LylajoyRose> Why hasn‚Äôt Fox called main for Susan Collins she is way up by 7 points with a little over 70% votes counted. These people in the Fox panel must never cover an election again.
1323869197399568384 2020-11-04 14:06:27 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @JoeBiden @AlBawabaEnglish Only if you cheat.

1319489240716070912 2020-10-23 12:02:04 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @IlhanMN Biden‚Äôs problem isn‚Äôt stuttering, it‚Äôs Hunter‚Äôs hard drive and Hunter‚Äôs flipping business partners.
1319488708228251649 2020-10-23 11:59:57 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @TomiLahren @jjauthor Why are these lying jerks still on the air? Per Donna Brazile lying is not protected speech.
1319488385296203777 2020-10-23 11:58:40 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @JohnAvlon @brianstelter @CNN Biden lost the debate the minute Hunter‚Äôs laptop became an issue.

1319485186652786688 2020-10-23 11:45:58 +0800 <LylajoyRose> Then you had better get Joe Biden to drop out of the race before he makes another racist statement.

1319472294364729345 2020-10-23 10:54:44 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @robreiner Yes Biden did lie a lot.
1319472241881460736 2020-10-23 10:54:31 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Sifill_LDF @AmbassadorRice President Trump never said that.

1319470124550688768 2020-10-23 10:46:06 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @IlhanMN @JoeBiden @BernieSanders @EdMarkey The Democrats want to shut down the use of giddily fuels, how are you going to heat your home this winter if they get in?
1319469883889909760 2020-10-23 10:45:09 +0800 <LylajoyRose> Dana Perrino the bar is high for both candidates, they are running for President.
1319469629035536384 2020-10-23 10:44:08 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @ddale8 @WalshFreedom So when Biden lied he was imperfect and made false misleading statements. Give America a break.

1319468551355465729 2020-10-23 10:39:51 +0800 <LylajoyRose> With Hunter‚Äôs hard drive in play and money being taken by his family and Jill shows up on stage with a mask matching her dress, how much did a new dress and mask cost her. The ordinary American can‚Äôt afford to have masks match each of their outfits. Bad look. #Debates2020
1319467825249931264 2020-10-23 10:36:58 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Norma4Congress No it‚Äôs not America look at the last tax cuts.

1319466897885151232 2020-10-23 10:33:17 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @CelesteKatzNYC Biden and Harris have both said they are going to do everything they can to stop fracking.
1319466710282375168 2020-10-23 10:32:32 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RepBrendanBoyle @JoeBiden So thus us what you are proud to support and thousands died. Shame on you.  https://t.co/ib4awMPGUZ
1319466377791467520 2020-10-23 10:31:13 +0800 <LylajoyRose> Joe Biden you said you were going to end fracking period. Google it America. #Debates2020
1319466113709699073 2020-10-23 10:30:10 +0800 <LylajoyRose> Biden came out and said he was going to stop fracking so has Harris.  #Debates2020
1319465817948393473 2020-10-23 10:29:00 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @CelesteKatzNYC And the home owner has to pay for it out of their own pockets. Read the green new deal, Biden just quoted it.
1319465639388434437 2020-10-23 10:28:17 +0800 <LylajoyRose> Name alm if these groups that are endorsing your plans Joseph. #Debates2020

1319464967666454528 2020-10-23 10:25:37 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @JenniferJJacobs You forgot the part that drug dealers and human traffickers kidnapped those kids.
1319464717497217025 2020-10-23 10:24:37 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @KamalaHarris Actually President Trump did and has for years denounced white supremacy and his family never owned slaves like your family did.
1319464377670459395 2020-10-23 10:23:16 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @ron_fournier @JoeBiden Joe Biden has never come out of the basement.
1319464050883883008 2020-10-23 10:21:58 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @nytdavidbrooks What moral core? Biden has taken millions of dollars of foreign money. The Biden bank a bounty must be criminally investigated.
1319463728547389440 2020-10-23 10:20:41 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @amybwang You lie for a living that‚Äôs why you are terrified of the truth.
1319463571042885633 2020-10-23 10:20:04 +0800 <LylajoyRose> So Biden has to lie again, President Trump said that Mexico send there worst and they are rapist and murders. Biden just called Mexicans rapists and Murderers with his lies. Biden has a a racist. #Debates2020
1319463094238601216 2020-10-23 10:18:10 +0800 <LylajoyRose> Black lives matter and Antifa are burning American cities and has no place in this debate. #Debates2020
1319462871512748033 2020-10-23 10:17:17 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @burgessev When did Biden try to over turn the crime bill he supported that incarcerated thousands of African Americans?
1319462481828343814 2020-10-23 10:15:44 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @katiecouric @CapehartJ Jonathan is a liar
1319462007368609797 2020-10-23 10:13:51 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Yamiche President Trump has, record low unemployment for the African American community and billions of dollars given to traditionally Black Colleges, Obama and Biden never did that did they.
1319461583378993152 2020-10-23 10:12:10 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @JonahDispatch Trump never did use the cages. The kids are very well looked after, the pictures mainstream media used were from 2014, who was President and Vice President during that time?
1319461314234740736 2020-10-23 10:11:06 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @vgescobar @realDonaldTrump Those kids were kidnapped. Glad you didn‚Äôt give a damned about that.
1319461113025605632 2020-10-23 10:10:18 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @LloydDoggettTX This is democrat health policy. Thousands died.  https://t.co/DU4vdhVX5x
1319460870053789696 2020-10-23 10:09:20 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @alexwagner No he‚Äôs not. You don‚Äôt lie about kidnapped children.
1319460755737985024 2020-10-23 10:08:53 +0800 <LylajoyRose> Biden and the democrat moderator didn‚Äôt even care that those 500 hundred kids were kidnapped, they flat out didn‚Äôt give a damn. #Debates2020
1319460375620841472 2020-10-23 10:07:22 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @DarrenSoto @JoeBiden And destroy small business so these people will lose their jobs.
1319460184012419073 2020-10-23 10:06:36 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @dberrygannett Nope
1319460134968463370 2020-10-23 10:06:25 +0800 <LylajoyRose> All this moderator keeps cut off President Trump #Debates2020
1319459848690388993 2020-10-23 10:05:16 +0800 <LylajoyRose> No child was ever ripped from their parents arms except by drug dealers and human traffickers people Democrats support. #Debates2020
1319459602430226433 2020-10-23 10:04:18 +0800 <LylajoyRose> Biden‚Äôs nose is getting longer. #Debates2020
1319459496989581315 2020-10-23 10:03:53 +0800 <LylajoyRose> Kidnapped Kids are brought in by drug dealers and human smugglers so it is hard to reunite these kids, some of them are pretty young.  #Debates2020
1319459042599661570 2020-10-23 10:02:04 +0800 <LylajoyRose> So I guess that‚Äôs why President Trump gave traditionally Black Colleges Billions of dollars. Obama didn‚Äôt even do that for African Americans.
1319458475357786112 2020-10-23 09:59:49 +0800 <LylajoyRose> RememberBiden raised his hand saying he was going to give free medical to illegal immigrants. #Debates2020
1319458295115964417 2020-10-23 09:59:06 +0800 <LylajoyRose> The so called heroes act wants to give stimulus money to illegal immigrants and give a tax cut to the rich. #Debates2020
1319458023245369346 2020-10-23 09:58:01 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Lynda_Tran @JoeBiden No he‚Äôs not, lying doesn‚Äôt set anything on fire. America read what Joe and Bernie have agreed to for America and it shows what a liar Biden is. Read the green new deal.
1319457624950145025 2020-10-23 09:56:26 +0800 <LylajoyRose> America take a look at the combined manifesto that Bernie and Joe have come up with and look at the green new deal.  #Debates2020
1319456730523160576 2020-10-23 09:52:53 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @AmeshiaCross That never happened with Obamacare and the labour unions haven‚Äôt endorsed anything.
1319456509114212353 2020-10-23 09:52:00 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @EdMarkey No one wants Obamacare.
1319456389580738560 2020-10-23 09:51:32 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @ksorbs It certainly will. Biden‚Äôs nose is getting longer.
1319455711814766593 2020-10-23 09:48:50 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @AmeshiaCross Biden will just get North Korea to give Hunter money and he will take his cut.
1319455266660732930 2020-10-23 09:47:04 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RubenGallego Guess that‚Äôs why Obama walked away from North !korea without a deal the last time they met.
1319455031997788161 2020-10-23 09:46:08 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @scottwongDC So what they have been discussing doesn‚Äôt matter to Joe Biden, what does? The money that Hunter gave him?
1319454214414692352 2020-10-23 09:42:53 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @JoyceKohTV Joe Biden hides in his basement and talks to 6 cars at his rallies that is lockdown.
1319453720338288640 2020-10-23 09:40:55 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @JonahDispatch Bubble this.

1319451743122436097 2020-10-23 09:33:04 +0800 <LylajoyRose> Obviously tax returns didn‚Äôt cover everything you have, that‚Äôs tax evasion isn‚Äôt it. #Debates2020
1319451359419068416 2020-10-23 09:31:32 +0800 <LylajoyRose> Thank you for confirming that Joe Biden is guilty up to his eyeballs. What happened to the 1.5 Billion dollars China gave to Biden.
1319450846573195264 2020-10-23 09:29:30 +0800 <LylajoyRose> A Russian pawn Joe, thank you for confirming your guilt. You and your family colluded with Russia and China. #Debates2020

1319450101559881729 2020-10-23 09:26:33 +0800 <LylajoyRose> So Joe Biden quotes the lying New York Times to try and back up his lies. #Debates2020
1319449834827309058 2020-10-23 09:25:29 +0800 <LylajoyRose> Look at the Democrat. Rallies they are in a lockdown. #Debates2020

The only announcement you make tonight is your are dropping pout off the race along with Kamala because she‚Äôs tied to all of this as well.

Liberals are also BLM and Antifa and they are burning businesses at the behest of Democrats.

1314537746640248837 2020-10-09 20:06:36 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Barnesville17 @SpeakerPelosi Speaker Pelosi, President Trump‚Äôs last negative test was the morning. Of October 1, 2020. I live in Canada, you are speaker of the house and I know way more than you do and President Trump is supposed to be the one with the problems?
1314537005334753282 2020-10-09 20:03:39 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @JoyAnnReid Whitmer was the one who politicized a crime and called President Trump horrible names, which makes one wonder if she wasn‚Äôt in on it in order to try and get President Trump.

1314029071521599488 2020-10-08 10:25:18 +0800 <LylajoyRose> Another dumb ass lying question. This moderator is such a disgrace to women every where. All liberal women seem to have gong for them is nothing but lies. #VPDebate
1314028814582730753 2020-10-08 10:24:17 +0800 <LylajoyRose> Kamala while you were Attorney General you had someone death row who was discovered to be innocent and you were going to ignore the evidence until you were taken to court forcing you to free the innocent person. #VPDebate

1314027559206547457 2020-10-08 10:19:18 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @aaronlmorrison The boyfriend fired in the police to try and kill them, of course the police are going to defend themselves.
1314027337134952449 2020-10-08 10:18:25 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @alexi Why? She chose a drug dealer as her friend and toon in his mail and packages. A big no no. Then her boyfriend tried to kill police officers.
1314026982032773120 2020-10-08 10:17:00 +0800 <LylajoyRose> #VPDebate this is a racial discussion and Kamala just brought up drugs. Speaks volumes about which party is racist.
1314026685784748035 2020-10-08 10:15:49 +0800 <LylajoyRose> The ex police officer who killed George Floyd will be in jail for the rest of his life   #VPDebate

1314026037873766400 2020-10-08 10:13:15 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @alivitali Because she is lying so as a woman I don‚Äôt have a problem with him cutting her off. It‚Äôs the consequences of lying.
1314025762060550144 2020-10-08 10:12:09 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @brianefallon She confirmed they are going to pack the court and end freedom in America.

1314025250271625222 2020-10-08 10:10:07 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @LorenaSGonzalez @KamalaHarris That‚Äôs because Harris is telling horrible lies about President Trump. Do women really like liars because they are women. Are we that desperate as woman. We can do better than Kamala.
1314024896498868225 2020-10-08 10:08:43 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @katiecouric That is a great job.

1313967596866215937 2020-10-08 06:21:02 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RoKhanna Lying once more. The only time any child was taken away is when the adult bringing that child across the border was not the parent but a kidnapper or if the parent was smuggling extra into the country, such as drugs.
1313967107172777984 2020-10-08 06:19:05 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RealJamesWoods I don‚Äôt know.

1313966062497538048 2020-10-08 06:14:56 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @EBraeden So Cuomo is great is he? Is this great? Personally I think it‚Äôs murder. Thousands died. Cuomo isn‚Äôt a great guy.  https://t.co/h5ORuRnOBm
1313965591368142848 2020-10-08 06:13:03 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @EBraeden So telling people to fight back and hopefully win is irresponsible. The opposite is to roll over and die if you get COVID. I thought you were a better person. So disappointed in you.
1313965002286460928 2020-10-08 06:10:43 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RealJamesWoods It‚Äôs also really really scary.

1313960891096858624 2020-10-08 05:54:23 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @EBraeden Except Trump isn‚Äôt going to do that. You will be covered for pre existing conditions. Obama was way too expensive for most Americans except for the rich.

1313839474896367617 2020-10-07 21:51:55 +0800 <LylajoyRose> Absolutely not.

1311910675145355264 2020-10-02 14:07:33 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @IsaacDovere Then Joe Biden isn‚Äôt fit to be President because he will be at high risk for dying from a cold or the flu.

You that live in a Democrat city or state won‚Äôt be able to get Hydroxychloroquine, because the Democrats in charge have made it illegal, which means if you guys get it you may die

1311241788464611329 2020-09-30 17:49:38 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @donnabrazile Actually the Democratic Party has the white supremacy vote because you guys support anti semitism. Richard Spencer and David Dukes both endorse their Democratic Party because of Democrat support of anti semitism and anti Semitics.

1309910442173583360 2020-09-27 01:39:21 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @RealJamesWoods These parents need to be identified and charged with child abuse.

1309898313169162240 2020-09-27 00:51:09 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @LBC That looks real good. Better lift the lockdown.

1309898114237489152 2020-09-27 00:50:21 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @CNN The ballots being found in ditches, garbage dumpsters and warehouses are casting doubt on the election. Vote in person, Joe and Jill Biden did. They know voter fraud was occurring.

1309897129221971968 2020-09-27 00:46:26 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @watchenu2 @marklevinshow Judge Sullivan must be brought to justice along with Obama and his administration. Obama is behind all of the violence that is occurring in America.
1309896705664450560 2020-09-27 00:44:45 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @marklevinshow Obama and his administration must he arrested immediately along with the members of the FBI who participated in the attack on General Flynn and President Trump. This was also an attack on the American people. Another reason all Democrats must be removed from government.

1309817468450344961 2020-09-26 19:29:54 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @WalshFreedom The police knocked and announced they were the police several times per witnesses. Guess truth doesn‚Äôt matter when you want egg on violent rioters.

Did he come out in a rage against the 5 Governors who issued executive orders to force long term care facilities to take people who were infected with coronavirus? Thousands died.  Or did Doug Jones stay silent and cover it up.  https://t.co/BwsD8GrIIb

Donald Trump has been under investigation years before he even ran for President nothing found.  You are trying to get Eric Trump in a perjury trap. Little children are being shot dead on New York streets and you are doing a witch hunt.

Not to mention the pain and suffering caused by watching the looting and rioting. Sue people Sue.

Soros is doing everything he can to destroy everything America stands for.  Soros was doing the same thing in Hungary and they kicked him out, The US must also.
1306917064985124864 2020-09-18 19:24:44 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @justinbaragona This is not a good enough apology. You and the hosts stifled the truth and you tried to give a very weak explanation for what happened. If you can no longer tell the truth have the good sense to move on and do something else. Do you punish your children for lying?
1306916431934578688 2020-09-18 19:22:13 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @MightyBusterBro @HARRISFAULKNER @MelissaAFrancis That was a very disgrace segment and sorry Harris your statement from yesterday has fallen woefully short. There must be massive am apologies and resignations, you stifled the truth and that is unforgivable. Soros is destroying your country call him out for it.

1306643649275375616 2020-09-18 01:18:16 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @MayorJenny Your failure to protect the people of Seattle got people killed, so of course you must be brought up on charges.

We need to bring back jobs to Calgary and fill up our existing office space with thriving businesses. We have empty office buildings before the Pandemic and while Notley and company were in office. The mess needs to be fixed.

1302934065608228865 2020-09-07 19:37:43 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @AttorneyCrump Hey Benjamin you might be in trouble, sounds like Jacob maybe growing up and starting to hold himself accountable. Instead of going after the police why don‚Äôt you actually help this young man to go forward instead of backwards. Help him get an education regardless of where he is.

America it‚Äôs time to fight back all lives matter needs to be the chant and Antifa and BLM and their supporters need to be stopped and turned over to the police. Along with elected Democrats. Fight back.

1302276834596323333 2020-09-06 00:06:07 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @thehill Except she didn‚Äôt back up a dammed thing. Where are these so called sources, why are they so afraid. My guess is there are no sources. Griffin must be fired.

1302275134259040261 2020-09-05 23:59:21 +0800 <LylajoyRose> Jennifer Griffin is a damned liar and she knows it.  President Trump even has paperwork to back it up and witnesses coming forward to say it never happened. Where‚Äôs her sources and who are they? My guess she doesn‚Äôt have a source and neither does the Atlantic.
1302274620679102464 2020-09-05 23:57:19 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Ky_Gill28 Except she hasn‚Äôt confirmed the story in any way shape or form.

1301879037954940928 2020-09-04 21:45:25 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @kylegriffin1 So I guess that‚Äôs why he signed orders for his funeral, for lying on state and adding John McCain‚Äôs name to the John McCain, joining his Grandfather and Father. President Trump said it once after McCain bashed his base and then called McCain‚Äôs policies loser policies.

1301870809435140097 2020-09-04 21:12:43 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @kylegriffin1 Guess that‚Äôs why President allowed McCain to lie in state on the hill and added his name to the John McCain. The ship is now named after Grandfather, Father and Son all named John McCain.
1301870409902518276 2020-09-04 21:11:07 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @Anthony There are too many eye witnesses that were on the trip and they are debunking your damned lies. You should be ashamed of yourself.

1301869576527912960 2020-09-04 21:07:49 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @LaurieRoberts So why did the pilots cancel the trip because of bad weather. You are a damned liar and God will deal with you.

1301868356237025286 2020-09-04 21:02:58 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @TheAtlantic So I guess that‚Äôs why President signed the order to let McCain lie in state at the capital. President Trump wasn‚Äôt invited and McCain‚Äôs loser family bashed him. Turned out per Cindy McCain they knew what Jeffery Epstein was doing and they said nothing.
1301867935875489793 2020-09-04 21:01:18 +0800 <LylajoyRose> @TheAtlantic @JeffreyGoldberg This is just me horrible pack of lies.
