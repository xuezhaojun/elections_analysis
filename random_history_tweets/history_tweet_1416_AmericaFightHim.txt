Otherwise, it's a little too late.

We should ask our leaders to primary someone against them. We should not vote for them when their time comes.

1343045911132430339 2020-12-27 12:07:52 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Is this how Trump pays all Americans that didn't vote for him? Not signing the bill even if his own supporters are hungry, evicted in his  need to spite the world?
1343044240956383233 2020-12-27 12:01:14 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @ReplicantX6 It gives his petty ass satisfaction.

1343036195241156608 2020-12-27 11:29:16 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @philippeinchina Yes!
1343036049090633728 2020-12-27 11:28:41 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @bluebeargirl20 It would be losing to Trump, even though a lot of people are depending on the bill.

1343033044723245056 2020-12-27 11:16:44 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Trump just Tweeted again about the $2000 payment. I don't think he signs this bill.
1343032242969444354 2020-12-27 11:13:33 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @OHhoneyBadgerIO Its a thought that crossed my mind because of the White HouseMeetings Trump had with those people I described.
1343028099060015105 2020-12-27 10:57:05 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @jbradye4344 Absolutely.  I'm ready like a lot of people here.

1343026551705784320 2020-12-27 10:50:56 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> I deleted my tweet about Erik Prince and rewrote it because I don't want anyone to believe I have any sources on this thought. It is a thought that crossed my mind due to the circumstances that I described. It can't be a coincidence.
1343024009890435072 2020-12-27 10:40:50 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @KerryDa34884235 So do I. I'm just putting out what I believe is going to happen because of unusual circumstances.

1343020200522821635 2020-12-27 10:25:42 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> I believe that Trump plans to use Erik Prince's mercenaries to incite unrest. Erik Prince met with Trump then he pardoned the mercs Trump also met with the head of the 'Proud boys' and later denied it. They have discussed disguising themselves as Biden supporters on Jan 20
1343005365395484672 2020-12-27 09:26:45 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @SonOfPepilepew Yep
1343005273737351168 2020-12-27 09:26:23 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @wildflowersees Damn right. I know they won't be successful.
1343005145374871557 2020-12-27 09:25:53 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @SonOfPepilepew And its ridiculous that they follow this cowardly bullshitter Trump who tells them, i'll see you in Washington on Jan 6 but has no intention of bringing his punk ass to any conflict. Instead he has these idiots that have been waiting all their live for a stupid end die for him.
1343004248905277440 2020-12-27 09:22:19 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @SonOfPepilepew Stupid is as stupid does. Let them go out in a whimper

Are you afraid to make the call? Or is this another film flam operation in a long line of bullshit attention seeking nothingburgers.

1342980180512542720 2020-12-27 07:46:41 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> I believe that a good compromise between Trump, the GOP and the Democrats for them all to accept a 1200 dollar check if that will save unemployment for so many.
1342978752263946241 2020-12-27 07:41:00 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @APGsMom Me either.
1342978583883608064 2020-12-27 07:40:20 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> How many Americans would $2000 help survive the pain they face. Is it just cruelty or indifference that motivates the Republicans.  They post pictures of food while people starve. They pretend to worry about the future of children but they deny them sustenance. Parasites!

I know Trump is a coward and he's never fought his own fights. Remember also he met with the Proud boys leader at the White House.  I hope the FBI sees this.
1342965696720994308 2020-12-27 06:49:07 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> If Trump signs the bill then he'll be a chump but it'll save unemployment for millions. I would forgo the $2000  and settle for the 600 if those people wouldn't lose their benefits. If he doesn't and the GOP doesn't change the amount then they are chumps. Trump, Be a chump.

I believe It'll cost them dearly in the Georgia Senate runoffs.

1342921057594986497 2020-12-27 03:51:45 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Even if Trump signs the bill today. He has proposed giving the American people 2000 dollars to help them in these tough times.  Not that he really cares. But this should show ALL Americans that the Republican Senate denied this aid to struggling Americans.  VOTE THEM OUT.

1341852201573072897 2020-12-24 05:04:29 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @LA_Karma1 Trump will probably fold and sign the bill but anything can happen.

1341851773506625538 2020-12-24 05:02:47 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @LA_Karma1 The onus now is really on the GOP and even weasel Graham said they should give out 2000.
1341851506455293952 2020-12-24 05:01:44 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @LA_Karma1 No, but now Trump has let the genie out of the bottle with his $2000 proclamation.  His followers heard it too. Trump just vetoed the defense bill so now they have to get in session to override him. Pelosi can take the vote for $2000 with the house.
1341849065374543877 2020-12-24 04:52:02 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @SpeakerPelosi The vote tomorrow for $2000 will be denied by the Republicans and thus just rendering it Theater. If Pelosi really wants to present it/pass it she should put it out there in a full session for a REAL vote.

1341761505323343872 2020-12-23 23:04:06 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> A full pardon provides absolution; it ends and/or preempts any punishment for an act. A commutation merely mitigates the punishment; it leaves a criminal conviction in place but reduces the consequences. ... Both were freed, but they are still convicted felons

1341563689535762432 2020-12-23 09:58:03 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Now Trump wants to stick his head out of the bunker and to pretend to care about struggling Americans?  We should ALL get $2000 a month for 6 months and it still would be a fraction of the TaxCut the GOP gave to the Wealthy. Trump is full of it. He is desperate.

1341227948733546497 2020-12-22 11:43:56 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> I don't know. Its usual to me that the Military would out of the blue release a statement saying they would not interfere in an election,  unless Trump had already crossed that bridge.

Uneasy that Everyone is just waiting for 30 days to pass when you have people in Congress calling for sedition. I'm on edge.

1341220913803636736 2020-12-22 11:15:59 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Those Republicans in Congress who have called for sedition against this country should not be seated by Nancy Pelosi. They have given up their right to serve the American people.
1341220436328259584 2020-12-22 11:14:05 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> If Trump tries to call the Military to impose martial law and they refuse can Trump be arrested?
1341220129741434880 2020-12-22 11:12:52 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> The reason Trump is contemplating martial law is because the House didn't impeach him for election interference.

The 'proud' boys😆have said they would disguise themselves as Biden supporters on that day to start a riot. Thats probably why Trump invited their leader to the White House.

1340529676779986944 2020-12-20 13:29:15 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @BarbaraKJanik I don't think so. General Miley said the Military doesn't serve a dictator, but he also marched through peaceful protestors after they were gassed. He apologized afterwards but it made me uneasy then.

1340509019392401413 2020-12-20 12:07:10 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @MBloodrust I heard that the "proud boys" were planning to disguise themselves as Biden supporters on inauguration day and cause a riot.

1340508415278407681 2020-12-20 12:04:46 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @MBloodrust This is where it gets funny. He can't live at Margo lago for more than 7 days at a time or 4 weeks in a year because of an agreement he has with that city. He's gotten away with it while President but his neighbors are already objecting because Trump is renovating to live there.

1340475815046356992 2020-12-20 09:55:13 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> If Mike Pence was at the oval office when Trump asked about declaring martial law and hasn't invoked the 25th amendment, does that mean he's okay with that insane premise?
1340474872045182976 2020-12-20 09:51:28 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Michael Flynn talks about declaring martial law, then all of a sudden he's in a meeting with Trump where Trump actually brings this up. Do you think Trump is about to promote Flynn to lead the Military?

1339305825899323392 2020-12-17 04:26:06 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Curious, will a pardon from Pence to Trump now cover any espionage charges? If Trump allowed Russian intelligence to access our systems, would a pardon still cover those crimes?

1339287853302427649 2020-12-17 03:14:41 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @FishinBarrelDoc If Joe Biden both allows an independent AG like @glennkirschner2 or @PreetBharara  and allows a special committe to investigate all the crimes that have been buried, we won't have to wait a lifetime.
1339287140312690692 2020-12-17 03:11:51 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @JustinLawGuy No, the intrusion into our systems was launched months ago not the assault.
1339286825416921090 2020-12-17 03:10:36 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @LilacsxGirl Thank you for the follow
1339286646945165312 2020-12-17 03:09:54 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @David747Heavy And Trumpsheep are still keeping their eyes closed, to said bullshit.😁
1339286261283123202 2020-12-17 03:08:22 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @uDraft520 The intrusion was 9 months ago.
1339282686171602952 2020-12-17 02:54:09 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @kathrynpra @AnneMarieKinnin Except the part about Krebs. I don't believe in coincidence
1339282506655346689 2020-12-17 02:53:26 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @kathrynpra @AnneMarieKinnin I agree wholeheartedly with that. We have to wait till Biden is in control and he can get at the facts.
1339281836548165635 2020-12-17 02:50:47 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @PezJohnny I'm just asking you to think about that.
1339281731648675842 2020-12-17 02:50:22 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @PezJohnny Really?
1339279611952328707 2020-12-17 02:41:56 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @kathrynpra @AnneMarieKinnin I just find this oops discovery story a tad bit to digest. Chris Krebs said this was the safest election we had in history which means we were checking everything.
1339277313515675650 2020-12-17 02:32:48 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @JaneJannievic @Trish5_Here Oh, I believe he's still selling us out.

1339269134136307719 2020-12-17 02:00:18 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @windblaster62 No, the intrusion was in March. We only found out about the large-scale attack after Chris Krebs was fired.

1339265976492314626 2020-12-17 01:47:45 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @45_lies They were in the system. We found out about this massive attack after Chris Krebs was fired.
1339263587823611907 2020-12-17 01:38:16 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @C5Heavy Yes
1339263026357284867 2020-12-17 01:36:02 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @Amusedandhappy He paid off his debts
1339262567886315525 2020-12-17 01:34:13 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @Sydfish They said this was the safest election in American history. We were watching.

1339259227072647169 2020-12-17 01:20:56 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @JohnCahoon2 They got into our systems months ago. We don't know when they launched an attack.
1339255020869595138 2020-12-17 01:04:13 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @Sydfish We dodn't hear about major intrusion till he was fired.
1339254427878830083 2020-12-17 01:01:52 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> To everyone that keeps saying they were in the system since last March. True. But I don't believe they launched any major cyber attack till Chris Krebs was gone because shortly after that was when we found the extent of the intrusion and what they may have taken.
1339253522534195206 2020-12-17 00:58:16 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @GayNLewis2 You should hate evil. You should hate Trump.

1339251537089073154 2020-12-17 00:50:23 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @Keauhou @leftypatriot We don't really know when it was launched.
1339251086314643458 2020-12-17 00:48:35 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @JennySa10054023 Yes
1339250860153573376 2020-12-17 00:47:41 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @ojailola The severity of the attack comes out shortly after he's fired? Sounds fishy to me.
1339250583862206466 2020-12-17 00:46:35 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @ojailola We don't know.

1339088790820966400 2020-12-16 14:03:41 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> The real question is, how many times has Trump sold us out to Russia?

1339059656845561857 2020-12-16 12:07:55 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @JjacksonReal Yes, my point to make people think. I don't believe this has been going for that long with the most secure election IN HISTORY. Its just a cover story. They fired Chris Krebs for a reason and it wasn't because Trump got his feelings hurt.
1339058633208893441 2020-12-16 12:03:51 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @KGJM They wouldn't cover up the real reason? Listen to yourself.

1339056970268020736 2020-12-16 11:57:14 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @CzekajPeter @califtotex Right. Its not like Hillary didn't warn us.
1339056660774596608 2020-12-16 11:56:01 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @danzingnumbers I don't buy it. It was all of a sudden out in the open and their story is they were hacked as far back as March. Sounds like a made up story.
1339056072334712832 2020-12-16 11:53:40 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @BeckyFSinWA @sveltstuff Thats my point, Krebs gets fired and all of a sudden all this coming out and its pushed back to March as if someone's trying to change the narrative.

1338968207001071616 2020-12-16 06:04:32 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> I don't think it was a coincidence that Trump removed Cyber specialist Chris Krebs just before the Russian cyber attack was launched. Trump is a Russian Asset.

1338943923146862594 2020-12-16 04:28:02 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @FrankSowa1 @MBloodrust Don't you think it ridiculous to even have a challenge to the electoral college if it is based on "misspellings?" The electoral college has declared who the President is and it can be delayed or overturned because of misspelling? That a flaw.
1338943132185059328 2020-12-16 04:24:53 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @FrankSowa1 @MBloodrust I think you're mistaken as far a challenge. In order for there to be a challenge from either the house or senate, there must be one congressperson AND a Senator that submit an objection from each body if they are to retire to discuss the objection.

1338940730631450624 2020-12-16 04:15:21 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @FrankSowa1 @MBloodrust Once the electoral college declares a person President, it is a public declaration and should not be contested for clerical errors.

1338921929558913026 2020-12-16 03:00:38 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @FrankSowa1 Here's my reasoning Frank. If the Senate and the House had been Republican, they could have overturned the will of the peoples vote by both bodies objecting to the electors. There in my opinion is something flawed if after the electoral college votes, it can be changed.
1338920550098472966 2020-12-16 02:55:09 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @pereztogo @scott_squires You mean Trump lost right?

You would need both the House and the Senate to approve the objection to the electoral vote and thats not going to happen with a Democratic House. But it does show a vulnerability in our electoral processes.

1338319394372530177 2020-12-14 11:06:23 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @Brindlepooch Wouldn't you love to see Trump grabbed at an airport trying to flee an indictment and perpwalked through the terminal while people shout, "LOCK HIM UP, LOCK HIM UP!!"
1338318788157116421 2020-12-14 11:03:58 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Its so true. Once you accept the fact that Trump is working for Russian interests, all the damage he has done to this country is explained.
1338318079131086852 2020-12-14 11:01:09 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @joyceePAeeee272 Agreed
1338317989603663873 2020-12-14 11:00:48 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @TrueBlueResists He'll also be in court a lot. We don't know what eventually will be uncovered that may implicate Trump once the protection of the Presidency is gone. I believe he will flee the country.

1338312283651510274 2020-12-14 10:38:07 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @BbOgdn If he quits after the Democrats take the Senate, we could confirm a person who won't pardon him.
1338311592954507265 2020-12-14 10:35:23 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> I hear some say Trump will start a media company or Trump will run for office in 2024 but in reality Trump will be running to stay out of jail. The Manhattan DA and SDNY will be waiting and we don't know the scope or reach of what they are investigating. Trump probably will flee.
1338311351714852865 2020-12-14 10:34:25 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @PeaceTrumps @owlkeller Having said that, I believe the Democrats have to change how they go about business. Save the decorum for your house and your loved ones and handle the business of the American people with iron gloves.

1338286062498672641 2020-12-14 08:53:56 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> I may be in the minority but I truly believe that once Trump isn't President and it dawns on his rabid followers that his word means nothing, Trump will fade away. The GOP who have debased themselves will have lost EVERYTHING for a con man. They will be empty shells.

1336483446219223042 2020-12-09 09:30:58 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @MBloodrust I think Biden is trying to put it all behind him. His choice of AG will determine if he weaponizes the AG and DOJ like Trump did. Even if there is an independent council, the AG has to be willing to prosecute crimes he finds committed by the past administration.

1336449496595750913 2020-12-09 07:16:04 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> So if Trump didn't buy enough vaccines for Americans from Pfizer, why is he buying from Moderna or the other vaccine makers? Could there be profit in it for Trump or his people? Or any Public official? Getting the vaccine as quickly as he could should have been Trumps goal.
1336447912977510400 2020-12-09 07:09:47 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> So a company Trump used to build the wall brought over Mexican nationals from Mexico to do work that American workers should have been doing? So I guess putting Americans to work was another lie from Trump.
1336434716376002568 2020-12-09 06:17:20 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Remember that Doug Jones voted to appoint Bill Barr for Attorney General crossing party lines to do so. He should not be Attorney General.

The Republican Senate had the power to stop him but they are complicit. Some tied to him through politics, some tied by corruption. The wrong people at the worst possible time in charge of oversight.

1335359825593716742 2020-12-06 07:06:06 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Trump called Gov Kemp from Georgia and asked him to illegally overturn the results of the Georgia certification for Joe Biden. Its blatant election interference.  Congress should impeach Trump for his abuse of power.

1334987517603491846 2020-12-05 06:26:41 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @DeniseGriewisch I blame this all on her. She had to be pushed to impeach Trump and did it when it was too late. She should have impeached him EVERY TIME Trump committed an impeachable act because if the GOP could they do it, they do it every time. She was feckless and are weaker for it
1334985890876301314 2020-12-05 06:20:13 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @kniggej Again I put this question out. What won't Trump do to avoid rotting in prison?
1334985675754643458 2020-12-05 06:19:22 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @kniggej The problem with that is that the people he is installing are not stupid and know how the government works.

1334984341466845188 2020-12-05 06:14:04 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @kniggej True, but I believe his efforts are towards his greatest fear. To stay out of prison. While he's President he enjoys protection for his grift and atrocities but when he's not, he knows he will face ruin and jail for a long time. What would he do to avoid that?
1334983366878388235 2020-12-05 06:10:12 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @MBloodrust @FrankSowa1 @Sentinel103 @DrBear88020735 @semperdiced @amvetsupport @rtmcclure Hmmm, I hadn't thought of that.
1334982942997831680 2020-12-05 06:08:31 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @dragonbait205 I agree with you there. If Trump has done anything that would be called a plus It was to take the mask off of those Republicans that were once thought to have integrity. They are a cowardly, craven lot, just like the White Supremist they dance for.
1334982134591877121 2020-12-05 06:05:18 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @MBloodrust I'm not disagreeing with you. I'm just saying, up till now, Trump has gotten away with things we NEVER imagined a President would do unchallenged.  The challenge by the House itself regardless of what the Senate does is a check, a barrier on these types of actions.
1334981271806685185 2020-12-05 06:01:52 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @dragonbait205 He should be impeached EVERYTIME he commits an impeachable crime, an abuse of power because we can't allow that behavior to become a normal avenue for a President. Calling it out is the job of the House. The Senate is corrupt and diminished and a separate governing body.

1334978856588107776 2020-12-05 05:52:16 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @MBloodrust When has Trump followed the norms?  He is President right now and is surrounding himself with yes people in the Pentagon.  Whether the military will follow is doubtful. But never doubt his intent.
1334978158261641218 2020-12-05 05:49:30 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @DeniseGriewisch Forget about the Senate at this point, with less than 50 days left. We need to impeach because we can't allow this behavior to stand. To become normal for the next Autocrat wannabe or for the Republicans in General.

You impeach him because you have to stop Trump from normalizing this behavior. You don't care what the Senate will do because you are a separate governing body.

1334050417630715904 2020-12-02 16:22:59 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> What Ted Cruz, Mark Rubio and all those Presidential wannabes who ride the Trump coat as he slithers out don't realize is that most of Trumps base doesn't like them either so basically, they gave up any respect they may have garnered in the past, for nothing.

1334043706790453248 2020-12-02 15:56:19 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @bblock29 The way I see it, Bill Barr threw out that bone to the media about their being no election fraud, then went to a 2 hour meeting with Trump where he probably told him about the pay for pardon court documents, how fukd he was, and how he'd better pardon him😆

1334025064459669504 2020-12-02 14:42:15 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> I get so frustrated when confronted with Trumps crimes the Democratic lawmakers talk about putting laws to stop those crimes from happening again instead of dealing with his crimes now. This is why they are always punching bags.

1333979652650659840 2020-12-02 11:41:47 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> I think Chief Judge Beryl Howell is ringing the pardon alarm bell.

1333974447213187073 2020-12-02 11:21:06 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Do you think Barr told Trump about the judge unsealing the documents showing a Presidential pardon for pay when he went to meet with him today? Cloaking his visit with a prior announcement telling the media there was no election interference? Did that judge ring an alarm bell?
1333972674238885891 2020-12-02 11:14:04 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> I guess we know why Trump isn't conceding yet. In between fundraising for his retirement from his foolish sheep, he's trying to cover his tracks preparing to pardon anyone who has benefitted from his corrupt 4 years in office.

1333964333198532609 2020-12-02 10:40:55 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @COVIDNorthEast Thank you, but does that apply to a President?

1333962740478717952 2020-12-02 10:34:35 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @JillyAW And what I would ask myself if where does it go from here?
1333962323346808832 2020-12-02 10:32:56 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @Ihatetosayit Not for a Presidential pardon me thinks?
1333961908416864258 2020-12-02 10:31:17 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @EtcNavy @glennkirschner2 That was nuts, now we multiply that by Trump supporters around the country.😆
1333961287391465473 2020-12-02 10:28:49 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> How much money was offered to Donald Trump to pardon someone who was locked up? Did Trump pardon someone for money? Everyone who Trump pardoned should have their bank accounts checked to see if any money was diverted to Trump or his properties.
1333961196123418625 2020-12-02 10:28:27 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @realDonaldTrump @RealDrGina @RealAmVoice How much money was offered to Donald Trump to pardon someone who was locked up?

1333956651561463808 2020-12-02 10:10:24 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Why is Trump seeking to pardon Jared, Ivanka, Don jr, Eric if they have not committed crimes? How is it possible that if there is this much corruption in an administration that a corrupt President can pardon it all away. Are there any remedies?
1333955439697006593 2020-12-02 10:05:35 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @EtcNavy @glennkirschner2 Makes me antsy
1333953144859074560 2020-12-02 09:56:28 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @EtcNavy @glennkirschner2 I was reading about how Congress and the Senate could challenge the electoral college Biden wins if they wished to. In normal times we wouldn't have to worry but in these partisan times, anything can happen.

You can't because you have no evidence of fraud. You have helped Guliani destroy your career.

When you let Bush get away with his crimes, you helped create Trump. Bidens AG and DOJ should be independent. You can kumbaya later.

Could it be because Jon Ossoff asked him about the trades he made after he was informed of the severity of the Pandemic? Instead of Perdue letting his constituents know to protect their families, he protected his stocks.

A majority wins. Its time to have a candidate that really represents us.
1333129762320035843 2020-11-30 03:24:38 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @JoeBiden No one even a President is above the law. Trump must be held accountable.

1332977836555182080 2020-11-29 17:20:56 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @realDonaldTrump The House has to investigate and impeach Trump for abuse of power for interfering in the election. What he has done needs consequences.

1332923787239694338 2020-11-29 13:46:10 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> I wish I could be part of, in the smallest way, of the effort to bring Trump and his accomplices to justice, to pay for their crimes, but I will have to leave that to better men and women who have prepared for this task and hope that Biden allows them to do it.

1332330792345886721 2020-11-27 22:29:49 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> I understand Trump fatigue. People just want it to be over. At the same time I believe that if Trump or his accomplices are allowed to stroll away without consequence, then in 2024 we will be going through a worse situation with an emboldened, smarter autocrat wannabe.
1332328490499190785 2020-11-27 22:20:40 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> History has shown us that when crimes by public officials are allowed to fade away without consequence by an incoming administration, it only emboldens the same behavior or worst from the next administration if they are corrupt or compromised like Trump became. Investigate Trump.
1332321443342938112 2020-11-27 21:52:40 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @realDonaldTrump You were a chump years ago when you refused to serve in the military to serve your country, you were a chump in New York when you stiffed contractors who did work for you. You're a chump and a loser now that you've lost the election. Grow a pair Donald.

1332315533774118914 2020-11-27 21:29:11 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @JoeBiden Biden has to separate his attempt to heal the divisions in this country with his obligation to allow justice to proceed by appointing an independent Attorney General, He must have a DOJ that will not be subject to the whim of a President.

If you allow him to threaten you with chaos and capitulate to his demands to leave office without facing charges, then you are a coward and have weaponized the DOJ just like Trump did. We can't heal that way.

Congress would be awakened and those bills you mention would be one of many. We cannot heal if there is no rule of law for the average person and a President(Trump). The dam would break.
1332116755171463173 2020-11-27 08:19:18 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @glennkirschner2 Then send Mnuchin to prison.

1332116452204285952 2020-11-27 08:18:06 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @glennkirschner2 I believe that. I hope Biden separates his kumbaya policy from the DOJ. The AG must be independent from any Presidential influence. In the end I believe Biden will do great things for this country but we cannot heal if a President (Trump)is above the law.

1332072404059820037 2020-11-27 05:23:04 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> If you allow Trump to escape the consequences of his actions, you are protecting the wealthy, the rule of law remains only for those of us who have no office or wealth. You become as bad as Trump. NO ONE should be above the law if you want to restore the rule of law.

1332054007578304512 2020-11-27 04:09:58 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> So Biden will be able to see into that secret vault where Trump has hidden his conversations. If he sees an example of treason or crimes committed by Trump or anyone in his administration, should he sound the alarm? Can he sound the alarm if our country's security is in danger?

1332046443721465862 2020-11-27 03:39:55 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @DeniseGriewisch Pence is a Vice President not a President. What I meant was that Trump would be, even for a day, sharing his place in history with another Republican President if he were to resign and Pence would be sworn in as President.

1332023769137811459 2020-11-27 02:09:49 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> I still remember when there were 5 coronavirus deaths and Trump stated it would all go away. Today the deaths top 263,000.
1332011253926080512 2020-11-27 01:20:05 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> The International Court in Hague should bring charges, prosecute and convict and jail Donald J Trump and his accomplices for Crimes against Humanity for torturing, and in some cases killing people seeking asylum from persecution from countries they fled from.

1331894919963828226 2020-11-26 17:37:48 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @MajesticResists @SpeakerPelosi It certainly will be interesting.  Hopefully very painful for Trump. I want to see Trump stripped of all his properties, his children stripped of their wealth and for them to serve hard time.
1331891457603547138 2020-11-26 17:24:03 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @MajesticResists @SpeakerPelosi They are 2 separate governing bodies. The actions of the House shouldn't predicate on the cowardice of the Senate. You impeach Trump so you don't normalize his behavior for a future autocrat wannabe.  You follow the law.

1331881515068829696 2020-11-26 16:44:33 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @MajesticResists @SpeakerPelosi After the Senate acquitted Trump, he committed various impeachable acts and crimes she should have acted on. Her silence only emboldened him. It seemed like she was beaten back into her safe space. I only hope that she sees the moment and acts on it now that Trump is down.
1331880773444644865 2020-11-26 16:41:36 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @MajesticResists @SpeakerPelosi She impeached him. Too late. She should have done it when the Special Counsel was investigating Trump. Combined the efforts of Congress and the Special counsel to prevent Trump from hiding the truth the way he did. She gave up after that.
1331878661386067968 2020-11-26 16:33:12 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @Peacekeeper876 @SpeakerPelosi They must have a two pronged attack, one to educate the youth in red states, take away the ignorant right wing influence through investment in the rural communities.  They must also bring to consequences those who have defiled this government and its people so it'll never repeat.
1331876939804631040 2020-11-26 16:26:22 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @Ben__Sanderson @SpeakerPelosi Trump should have been impeached EVERY TIME he committed an impeachable crime and maybe he wouldn't have been so emboldened to continue to break norm after norm because he felt no pressure, no consequence.
1331875152334901248 2020-11-26 16:19:16 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @Peacekeeper876 @SpeakerPelosi I see it a little differently. I think Nancy Pelosi is effective but she is politically inclined to keep the waters calm, even when the storm approaches. But sometimes the storm is in charge.

1331858832725782528 2020-11-26 15:14:25 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @Ben__Sanderson @virginia_true I believe it is an open question as to whether he can pardon himself. I mean, he's not a king and our founding fathers never intended a President to be able to function as a king. Just my opinion.

1331848661198917634 2020-11-26 14:34:00 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @virginia_true I'm referring to Federal crimes.
1331847985999863813 2020-11-26 14:31:19 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @QueenPhillippa It has been speculated that Trump might pardon his children from Federal Charges. There must be something hidden.
1331847476383539200 2020-11-26 14:29:17 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Biden has to separate his attempt to heal the divisions in this country with his obligation to allow justice to proceed by an independent Attorney General and a DOJ that will uncover crimes against our country that should never be ignored or allowed to fade.

1331843316170764288 2020-11-26 14:12:45 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Once Flynn accepts that pardon, all of Trumps crimes can be uncovered if Flynn were to be forced to testify against Trump because if he accepts the pardon Flynn can't plead the fifth.

Biden has to allow the AG and DOJ to do their jobs to restore trust in the government and this guy would do his job, without fear of public opinion.

1331796765054554113 2020-11-26 11:07:47 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @nomore8digits He should be in the DOJ.
1331794558410059776 2020-11-26 10:59:00 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Donald Trump pardons Flynn and he will probably pardon Manafort and Biden talks about healing but we cannot heal if you don't restore the rule of law by establishing that no one even a President is above the law.

At least we know McConnell plan for the future. To impede Bidens agenda. Pelosi got her speakership and is on vacation. Trumps election interference is not on her mind.
1330964416188309505 2020-11-24 04:00:19 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @yurkiddingme @tb_terry Bex, i get your point. I'm actually looking forward to that. Congress should have impeached Trump everytime he committed an impeachable offense so as to not normalize that behavior but instead they hid and waited as they always do and they always hurt themselves.
1330962461848166403 2020-11-24 03:52:33 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @beauxb2003 🤣🤣I love it
1330962224114962436 2020-11-24 03:51:36 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @yurkiddingme @tb_terry Congress does not impeach a President because they are balancing the budget, they impeach a President when he has committed crimes. Of course we need a relief package but one thing has nothing to do with the other. We can't allow that type of intent to become normal.

I have kids also and my kids learned there were consequences in life to bad behavior. If they did something they weren't supposed you they got sent to their rooms, had their phones taken away. Consequences.
1330949061126590466 2020-11-24 02:59:18 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @MIDIWerks Not symbolic. You stop this behavior from being normalized.

The only way to shed the stain is for them to call him out, cut the cord but a lot of them have been uncovered to be just like Trump. No masks anymore.
1330310188902060032 2020-11-22 08:40:39 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @AndrewDorony It could very well be true. But why are we here? Because a President is interfering in an election and we can't stand back and watch that and hope all is well. We can't normalize abhorrent criminal behavior for the next Trumplike person in power .

1330011335225208832 2020-11-21 12:53:07 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @EtcNavy @jack_rubye Impeachment should not predicate on political gains rather on the rule of law. Again, I respect your opinion. Just don't agree.
1330011052252205057 2020-11-21 12:51:59 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @EtcNavy @jack_rubye I respect your opinion but I believe the race in Georgia will come down to turn out. 700,00 people have requested mail-in ballots. I like our chances there and the people who will win it won't mind if Trump is impeached again.

1330009056853934080 2020-11-21 12:44:04 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @EtcNavy @jack_rubye Regardless, to attempt to impeach is what they should do if only to show that this behavior isn't normal. They should have impeached him EVERYTIME he committed impeachable acts and the next autocratic wannabe would had seen the consequences of that type if behavior.
1330006548790325255 2020-11-21 12:34:06 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @EtcNavy @jack_rubye Then they should impeach.

Not by race but maybe the amount of cultists in our respective areas.  I was shocked to see the ignorant metamorphosis of certain areas of Scranton when Trump took over.

1329633508600504320 2020-11-20 11:51:46 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @EtcNavy @Cherylynne7 Then the Democrats have to toughen up and try to reach these cultists through policies that help them. They also have to play hardball with the GOP.  What would the GOP be doing if the roles were reversed.

Its used for impeachable offenses and as far as civil unrest. Those 12,000 people at Trumps "million dollar march" are the extent of his civil disobedience.

1329621053669249030 2020-11-20 11:02:17 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @AllisonNeedHope @pghdrew Exactly. Even if those canvassers changing their vote is not going to happen, the impropriety of Trump calling these Republicans who had a duty to the American people not Trump is election interference.

1329608784763875328 2020-11-20 10:13:31 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @DebN_inMI But this is just one of many small instances of Trumps election interference.
1329608547911540736 2020-11-20 10:12:35 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @DebN_inMI Yes
1329608205882814466 2020-11-20 10:11:13 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @AlexDLevin No problem brother✊✊
1329608104812679170 2020-11-20 10:10:49 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @AlexDLevin I called them electors because essentially thats what they do, certify the county votes. But they are canvassers. I should have used canvasser.
1329607196565512194 2020-11-20 10:07:13 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @Leslie64993617 @Wacipi That is the point of my tweet. That Trump has committed an impeachable act.
1329606056151035906 2020-11-20 10:02:41 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @sleepingkoala45 His vote was to confirm to county vote and at first he voted no with the other Republican but the public outcry forced them to change it back to yes. Then Trump calls them and they file an affidavit to change their vote back to no. Its too late but its election interference.
1329605414099546113 2020-11-20 10:00:08 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @AlexDLevin Move ahead to today and Trump calls the canvassers who reversed there no vote and all of a sudden they file an affidavit to again vote no. My point is that Trumps intent is to interfere in the election which I believe to be impeachable.
1329604902167965697 2020-11-20 09:58:06 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @AlexDLevin I've explained before. I'll do it again.  The canvassers certified the vote at the county level. Different name same job. Thats my I called them electors. You know that in the beginning they voted no to certify the county but later reversed because of the outcry.
1329604111034179584 2020-11-20 09:54:57 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @b_b_baconator @SCee57 Exactly canvassers that certify at a county level. Trumps intent is my point.
1329603655868305413 2020-11-20 09:53:09 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @odelllynch9 @JayKilgore7 Trumps intent at election interference is my point.

1329594966398672896 2020-11-20 09:18:37 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @Puahashopgirl @realDonaldTrump Apples, oranges. The Canvassers do the same job as electors at a smaller scale. My point is the intent by Trump to interfere in an election.
1329593247824535557 2020-11-20 09:11:47 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @joshvam @love2golf They are canvassers. They are in effect electors at a smaller scale by county

1329592488886226945 2020-11-20 09:08:46 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @TellUsWhy2017 Trump had a conversation with them and they changed their votes. Though its a symbolic reversal, Trumps intent is criminal and impeachable.

1329586019814019072 2020-11-20 08:43:04 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @SpeakerPelosi Nancy Pelosi. Is it ok for a President to call Republican canvansrs to try to get them to change their vote, which they have tried to? It's the intent to interfere that is impeachable. His abuse of power become High Crimes when he tries to subvert the will of the people.  Impeach

1329574022724677632 2020-11-20 07:55:23 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @ConradBain4 Its the intent by Trump thats the impeachable offense. He had a phone call with them and even though their vote is cast. They filed an affidavit to reverse their decision.

1329542939803082759 2020-11-20 05:51:53 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @13vixen @LisaMoraitis1 Because the Senate is corrupt and cowardly does not explain Congress not doing what's right.  And if they hadn't impeached Trump, wouldn't he have stolen the election. Wouldn't he still been emboldened. No you can't normalize that behavior, you call it out.

How is that not election interference?  how is that not impeachable? It doesn't matter that its symbolic on the electors part because its too late to change their votes.

You shouldn't have the job if you are afraid to speak out. To impeach a corrupt President.

1329212135352786947 2020-11-19 07:57:23 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @JoeBiden Biden doesn't have the authority to put anything behind him and clear Trump of all his crimes, unless he wants to weaponize the AG and the DOJ to do his bidding like Trump did. Biden should let the AG be an independent appointment and let them follow the law.

1329205069284315136 2020-11-19 07:29:18 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Biden's AG and DOJ have to make their own call if they decide to investigate and prosecute Trump.  Biden can't make that call or he will  weaponize the AG and DOJ like Trump did. No one is above the law. Biden shouldn't even be commenting on putting anything behind him.

We have been a witness to the putrification of a party, the Republican party.  People who know what they do is wrong and do it anyway. A cult.
1328975934431629312 2020-11-18 16:18:48 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Or this can be what happens when you live too long without a soul. Your body eventually rots from the inside/out.
1328975151774523393 2020-11-18 16:15:42 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> The reason I ask is because even though Trump is an poor excuse of for a primate, dumb as a rock, what is his end game if he plans to live abroad. Sending Guliani to delay the transition because real lawyers cost money.  Biden cannot let him leave without scrutiny.

1328616902143438848 2020-11-17 16:32:08 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Perhaps a different Republican Senator each chose a different AG or Republican involved with the vote of tough states for Trump or those Senators who were in a race to suggest ballots be thrown out.  Lindsey got Georgia. Who got south Carolina? Who got Kentucky?

Dead inside, devoid of empathy, missing the basic feelings that make us human beings. Consumed with hatred and ignorance, waiting for their savior of racist views to save them. They are truly dead.

1326714200341811200 2020-11-12 10:31:29 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @GiantsOfSF_NY It seems that these racist fuks all fell into public office at the same time and then Trump triggered their true natures.

1326712223406968834 2020-11-12 10:23:37 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Look at the governors of certain red states acting like they're prepared to declare Trump President, recounting by hand a vote count that isn't even close and acting like they're prepared to secede from the union. Its crazy.
1326712029663596544 2020-11-12 10:22:51 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @GiantsOfSF_NY Correct

1326709778123517952 2020-11-12 10:13:54 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Trump just said he easily won Pennsylvania and Michigan. This after changing the leadership in the Pentagon. This is not a person who needs time to adjust to his loss, this is a person who wants to stay in power and we don't know what he's planning. The GOP is on board.

They've become empty headed cult members of a barricaded suspect in the White House. They've thrown away any semblance of humanity for a charlatan.

1326669131547086855 2020-11-12 07:32:23 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @kathrynresister I agree.

1326667932622073859 2020-11-12 07:27:38 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> I understand when people say, we have rules in this country that stop dictators from taking control and the Military takes an oath to protect this country and would never follow him.I want to believe in right and wrong in this twisted reality. I'll be calm when Trump is out.

Having said that, I believe Biden will be our next President. These are the scenarios that run through my head.
1326655814350872578 2020-11-12 06:39:28 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @BrenBreithaupt I'd like to believe that. A lot of people have shown their true faces. I believe in the end Biden will be President. I just don't trust the process in this abnormal administration.
1326653723196739589 2020-11-12 06:31:10 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @8maggiemay That could be it.
1326651866235727872 2020-11-12 06:23:47 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Of course you and I as distant observers can tell that Trump is definitely considering a coup. He's weighing his options and being pushed by those scared to face imprisonment like Jared and Miller as he changes the power structure to the Military.
1326650778094886913 2020-11-12 06:19:28 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Donald Trump will not be running for President in 2024. He'll spend the first couple of years fighting in court and the next 20 fighting off Bubba in prison. His children will be in court for years possibly prison. Their fortunes seized. As they deserve.

1326615125411983363 2020-11-12 03:57:47 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @DNinnymuggins @EstelCooper I betcha right.
1326614334999556096 2020-11-12 03:54:39 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @crzyfkinworld I think he wants to. He looks at Putin and Kim and he wants that power. Possibly what will save us is the caliber of people around him. Yes people usually can't think straight. It would take participation of the military to seize control though we should remember his S.S. DHS.
1326613475720916993 2020-11-12 03:51:14 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @smc429 Yes.

1326612601002921990 2020-11-12 03:47:46 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @Arkansas_72701 I'm talking about now. I'm sure all dictators started from some point and they seized power by bypassing the norms. Can it happen here? Probably not, but ask yourself why is he's putting yes people in positions of power? At this stage what's the point in that?
1326610472779587584 2020-11-12 03:39:18 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @Billy76786977 Wouldn't that be lovely.

1326608228885598208 2020-11-12 03:30:23 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Just food for thought but Trump builds a castle wall around the White House and then calls for a march on Washington by his supporters?

1326604261350907904 2020-11-12 03:14:37 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> If Trump decides to go full blown dictator, does the secret service still recognize him as President or are they allowed to arrest him?
1326603751675801605 2020-11-12 03:12:36 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Trump is either preparing for a full blown coup or destroying any evidence of criminal activities before Biden is allowed access to the government infrastructure.

1326444051344855042 2020-11-11 16:38:00 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @l78lancer @Ravnik68 What if the debt isn't real rather a reflection of the illegal money Trump has laundered?
1326443119747936257 2020-11-11 16:34:18 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @l78lancer @Ravnik68 And those loans were suspect in the first place. Oligarch money? I've never seen a bank so willing to write off debt.

1326412224441802768 2020-11-11 14:31:32 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> 71 million people voted for Trump and instead of helping those people, he plays golf. Disappears from the coronavirus briefings, Trump followers pay attention! Don't donate your hard earned money to his slush fund. Don't vote for another Republican. They don't care.
1326410245200076807 2020-11-11 14:23:40 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> If this is a Grift, another con job by Trump to create a slush fund on the back of his Trumpsheep, What does Pompeo get out of it? He can't run for President. What does Lindsey Graham get out of this?

1326209975765626882 2020-11-11 01:07:52 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @KwikWarren Trump is instructing his people not to cooperate. This is why there must be investigations into those who have broken the law or acted in inappropriate ways. Without investigations we can't restore the rule of law because we must establish that no one is above the law.

1326037584351518721 2020-11-10 13:42:51 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Perhaps the reason Trump want to wait to the last possible moment to begin the transation period is because he's destroying evidence against him or changing incriminating records.

1326034654126886912 2020-11-10 13:31:12 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> If Biden is given access to the government, would he be able to peek into those secret digital vaults Trump has hidden his conversations with world leaders?
1326033640963321857 2020-11-10 13:27:11 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> The reason Trump doesn't want to give Biden access to the government is because Biden or his people will probably find all manner of corruption, treasonous acts especially where all the taxpayer money has been funneled to and who in his family or administration is involved.

You can't forget how the GOP have acted for 4 years. They just voted for a judge who will take away Healthcare from millions. We need to play hardball now that we've won. They will.

Interference.

1324834613039169538 2020-11-07 06:02:40 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @ClaudiaWheatley I agree with your tweet. There is far too many different categories of crimes to just lump them all into one investigation.
1324829886041776132 2020-11-07 05:43:53 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @BrenBreithaupt Dennis Quaid, Scott Baio, James Woods. Who else? They are a lot more.

We need to fight to remove every Republican we can who enabled Trump and his racist agenda.  Those who committed crimes have to pay, then we can heal.
1324820413466234883 2020-11-07 05:06:15 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> They can get rid of their flags, their weapons, their balloons, their bullhorns or their racist mothers but they can't no longer put back on their fake human faces and pretend they never acted the way they did. We saw who you really are and we should never forget.

Unrepentant sycophants who were chosen not because of their expertise but rather their propensity to submit to better their own situations.

1324147684941451266 2020-11-05 08:33:04 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> My older daughter just called me, she said she voted for Biden yesterday. Thats 5 votes from my family for Joe Biden in PA.
1324146830666596352 2020-11-05 08:29:40 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Yesterday Biden was behind in PA by over 600,000 votes. As the votes have come in it has cut that lead to a little over 200,000 with a million votes being counted and about to be added to the total from Democratic leaning counties. I like our chances to take PA.

How could any Hispanic vote for a man who put Hispanic Children in cages? You are not exempt from Trumps or his followers racism.  You are a disgrace to your ancestors.

Trumps kids came out first like they'd robbed a bank and then a weak ass or high looking Trump came out and they tried to bullshit the nation by pretending to have a victory celebration for an election that wasn't over.  Pathetic

1324070059053096960 2020-11-05 03:24:36 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Because the Postal service was slowed down by eliminating sorting machines and hiding ballots in post offices by Louis Dejoy, the courts should rule that those ballots affected by this election interference should be allowed to be counted. And Louis Dejoy should be arrested.

1324065478394802177 2020-11-05 03:06:24 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Sullivan should jail Louis Dejoy.  US Postal Service blows court-ordered deadline to check for missing ballots. About 300,000 can't be traced  https://t.co/aXBj9wUVPk #SmartNews

1324046436342865920 2020-11-05 01:50:44 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> I was just doing the math in my head(math was never my strong suit) and it looks to me that if Biden keeps the states he's ahead on which is likely, because the ballots that are being counted are mail-in ballots and generally favor Democrats. He'll get to 270. Without PA.

Record any voter intimidation or inaction by police.  You have the RIGHT to cast your vote. VOTE FOR BIDEN/HARRIS If you can, go early. Plan your vote.

When Trump had emboldened these white supremacist, all of a sudden I started to see the signs. Quiet people who reverted to their worst versions. One even put up a confederate flag. At least now we know. They can never put on their fake human face.

1320129945436291072 2020-10-25 06:28:00 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @NancyLeeGrahn @lisamurkowski I was never interested, in politics.  I didn't see the importance of knowing who you were voting for. Not just a President, but the House, the Senate. We've gotten to see the best and the worst in our public servants under Trump. I will pay attention for the rest of my life.
1320127853950849030 2020-10-25 06:19:41 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> I like Bidens description "poor boys" instead of "proud boys." It describes them more accurately 😆😆

1319393347904196609 2020-10-23 05:41:01 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> In the last debate I wanted Biden to scream at Trump and berate him, in essence behave just like him in defending himself But that isn't Presidential or mature or worthy of someone who will lead this country. I'm just going to listen to Bidens message.and laugh at Trumps nonsense
1319391730744152068 2020-10-23 05:34:36 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> What i wouldn't give for one hug or kiss from my father who died years ago. Trump and his family has tried to mutate the meaning of love and affection to match their experiences. Their lifestyle. I doubt if any of them ever got a fatherly kiss or a hug from Donald Trump.

1319068376606658562 2020-10-22 08:09:42 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> The FBI gave the American public Trumps announcement that Russia is not really attacking our election process as much as Iran.

1318316828419121152 2020-10-20 06:23:19 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @JoeBiden If Trump mentions Hunter Biden's laptop, you ask him if he is spreading Russian disinformation to interfere in an election and if he knows its an impeachable offense?

1318302078977085440 2020-10-20 05:24:43 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> When Trump tries to press Joe Biden on Hunter Bidens laptop, Biden should ask him why he is using Russian disinformation to interfere in a Presidential election and does he know that it is an impeachable offence?

1316913513550520320 2020-10-16 09:27:03 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @LA_Karma1 I think after the mental abuse he suffered with Trumps rant, he started off a little gun shy but as it continued he got so strong and you can feel his emphathy when he speaks. I am so glad I missed Trumps rant. I am so optimistic right now hearing a real President speak.

1315448016896176129 2020-10-12 08:23:41 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> What the GOP Senators running for office should consider, is the McConnell has made his millions and will be taken care by the Federalist society so he can deny healthcare to us but they will lose their elections. To save themselves they must vote no to judge Barrett

1313288606803525632 2020-10-06 09:22:58 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> This is the type of President we have now, A petulant child who argues with his doctors to get a joyride to hear the cheers from his followers. An irresponsible adult who leaves the hospital though infected by a virus that has infected and killed 211,000 people.

1313286826975780866 2020-10-06 09:15:53 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> So Trump went back to the white House and instead of hiding his obvious sickness he had to stand outside to get the cheers that sustain him. Problem with that is that he was gasping for air.(Rachel Maddow) Trump is putting more people in danger by not staying in the hospital.

1312624436063993857 2020-10-04 13:23:47 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Do you think Ted Cruz has been promised a run at the White House or a V.P. position in 2024? It would explain his prostrating himself on his knees at the feet of the person who insulted his wife, his dad and his character. What else could explain his total debasement?

1312613152308310017 2020-10-04 12:38:57 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> When Trump is gone. These people who have taken off their human faces and showed their true nature of racism, ignorance, violence. What will they do? As the cover is peeled off of the deception that was fed to them and they will see what they're left with and what they became.

1311888197555814402 2020-10-02 12:38:14 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> So Hope Hicks traveled in tight spaces with all the Trumps children, Jared, Steven Miller and the rest of that evil lot. People ask me how can you be so cruel, so happy that they were exposed to it? I think about the 208,000 people that died because he played it down.

1311382603006644229 2020-10-01 03:09:11 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Trump believes that the American people are stupid and will believe any lie he might utter. Who believes he doesn't know who the 'proud boys' are?

1311140213566078976 2020-09-30 11:06:01 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @LA_Karma1 I was so angry.
1311139926105354242 2020-09-30 11:04:52 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @DharmaBum62 I guess you're right
1311139444561522688 2020-09-30 11:02:58 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> I kinda enjoyed when Biden asked," do you know what this clown is talking about?"

1311135620518031362 2020-09-30 10:47:46 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> @ToniaJohns18 And he let Trump cut Bidens time in half.
1311134057569361921 2020-09-30 10:41:33 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Chris Wallace sucks
1311131828598824961 2020-09-30 10:32:42 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> If Biden thinks Trump is going to let him speak, then he might as well not show up at the next debate.  He needs to have some fire and counter Trump with facts.
1311127931624751105 2020-09-30 10:17:13 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Biden should talk over Trump.

1311126849846759424 2020-09-30 10:12:55 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Inspite of Biden being interrupted by Trump all the time this is not good for Trump. He looks insane.

1311122135654576130 2020-09-30 09:54:11 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Why is Biden letting Trump get away with this shit!!!
1311118123987337220 2020-09-30 09:38:14 +0800 <AmericaFightHim> Is Chris Wallace going to let Biden speak? Is he going to stop Trump from interrupting Biden?
