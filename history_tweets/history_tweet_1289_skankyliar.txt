1344018492312481794 2020-12-30 04:32:33 +0800 <skankyliar> @seangrinyer @1RichieAllen Yeah 2000 Nhs beds cut last year, 17000 in the last 10yrs under the Tories. Over 30k beds cut the previous 10yrs under Labour. So our population increases yearly, every year the nhs struggles during the winter, yet they reduce bed numbers. Well that makes sense.

I know 2 people, myself included, the other being a recovering cancer patient who were told they would be held on covid wards, even though they didn't have covid! But they soon would.
1343842954977406978 2020-12-29 16:55:02 +0800 <skankyliar> @ClareCraigPath Why are they just not being honest and say the issue is due to staff shortages. But then I guess that would show Matt Wankcock for the liar he is, after making such a public dance about how he achieved to 're sign up thousands of x nhs staff.

1341494193412255747 2020-12-23 05:21:54 +0800 <skankyliar> @conservegently @NeilDotObrien That's why they were so quiet when I went in August. Now they are trying to play catch up but they've put the fear of God in people. I had 7 nurses waiting on me they were that quiet. Said they had been quiet all through the peak, they don't understand what's going on.

He needed a scan, he was meant to stop overnight (don't know why) but he was told he would be held on a ward with covid patients. He cancelled his scan.

1341488826087292928 2020-12-23 05:00:34 +0800 <skankyliar> @NeilDotObrien NHS was practically shut back in April. How many of these now covid cases aren't even in hospital for covid related illness? How many caught covid whilst in hospital, because I know 2 people who were meant to go in bit were told they would be put on a ward with covid patients.

Carehome residents weren't even worthy of taking into hospital. Over 30k people left dying at home. So not a great comparison there. But less that this time last year.

It was a shock but it shows how common it is for people to be walking around not knowing they are a ticking bomb. So  I'm sceptical at these covid deaths with no co morbities. I don't believe for one second that any healthy person died of covid.

Loads of cases, no hospital visits, in fact 90% didn't have any symptoms, of those that did, cold/flu like symptoms.
1340383875818766336 2020-12-20 03:49:53 +0800 <skankyliar> @Linda611 @droidinio @ToniaBuxton Yes he was tested! It came back positive, he had cold/flu like symptoms.
1340383709850169344 2020-12-20 03:49:14 +0800 <skankyliar> @Linda611 @droidinio @ToniaBuxton So if we can go back to your original post, before you add countless more friends. Your friend and her son's who had to quarentine. What symptoms dud they have?
1340382602398740483 2020-12-20 03:44:50 +0800 <skankyliar> @Linda611 @droidinio @ToniaBuxton Apparently his cold symptoms were  corona.
1340382392461213699 2020-12-20 03:44:00 +0800 <skankyliar> @Linda611 @droidinio @ToniaBuxton So you are adding another friend to the tale now. Originally it was one friend and her son's quarantining. Now we are at a friend of a friend üôÑ
1340381344539488260 2020-12-20 03:39:50 +0800 <skankyliar> @realDonaldTrump Wish you would tell Doris that!
1340381106017886210 2020-12-20 03:38:53 +0800 <skankyliar> @davefielding33 No but I will go and look.
1340380270869012482 2020-12-20 03:35:34 +0800 <skankyliar> @davefielding33 Of course.
1340380127306395649 2020-12-20 03:35:00 +0800 <skankyliar> @Linda611 @droidinio @ToniaBuxton Tell me how many were hospitalised?
1340380007441555462 2020-12-20 03:34:31 +0800 <skankyliar> @davefielding33 Yes, we know that, they know that. Bit it's not stopped this shit show thus far.
1340379581275115521 2020-12-20 03:32:49 +0800 <skankyliar> @davefielding33 For what? It's a health emergency. They can do whatever they want under the guise.
1340378978960465926 2020-12-20 03:30:26 +0800 <skankyliar> @davefielding33 Some of us won't be. Over 500.000 people die every year. Me or you could be within that figure, so I will live for today.

1340377631271874562 2020-12-20 03:25:04 +0800 <skankyliar> @davefielding33 Fully intend too. None of us might be here next year. But we are here now!

1340376440920018945 2020-12-20 03:20:21 +0800 <skankyliar> @BorisJohnson Care to share this evidence Boris. Maybe you could seek out the evidence of the original virus whilst your at it. Maybe then I will take note. Highly unlikely mind. You don't get to decide my life for me. I've managed on my own for 50+ years.

1340372829842378755 2020-12-20 03:06:00 +0800 <skankyliar> @Miodio2168 That's the spirit. This army needs as many foot soldiers it can get. But together we will get through this. Once you've clicked that this isn't about a virus, the safer you will be. üëç

1340337818330144768 2020-12-20 00:46:52 +0800 <skankyliar> @sineaddb1 I think so too.

1340337218578239489 2020-12-20 00:44:29 +0800 <skankyliar> @sineaddb1 Same here. Anyone of us might not be here to celebrate the next one. That's if all future Christmases aren't cancelled of course. Which I can see. All religious holidays scrapped.

1340307937705791488 2020-12-19 22:48:08 +0800 <skankyliar> @TheFreds Difference between Wuhan and  Britain is the Chinese already control their population numbers. This is what we are now witnessing, depopulation and population control.
1340306897132531712 2020-12-19 22:44:00 +0800 <skankyliar> @IVOTEDLEAVE3 Never was about a virus. Lockdowns kill and they know it, so we can only presume this to be a depopulation exercise.

1339494986052714500 2020-12-17 16:57:45 +0800 <skankyliar> @APK_musicreview @FatEmperor So you have no actual data on that üëç Your 1700 daily is not quite accurate. We have an average of between 8-10k weekly deaths during the Summer and between 11-13k weekly in the winter. Although we have seen it as high as 16k during the winter.

1339235905505271808 2020-12-16 23:48:16 +0800 <skankyliar> @SaVampiress People seem to think it's just the elderly are most at risk to dying. The parents of the seemingly fit  14yr old that died of a heart attack would say different. There is no pecking order with death. So embrace here &amp; now.

Who's to say they still aren't waiting to be paid. That's a long time to be fighting for compensation. Would suggest that if you are injured, you need to jump through a ring of fire to compensated.

But what we also need to take into consideration is that the NHS was operating below 50% from around April- September.

They are rising now, higher than the last 5yrs, but we still don't know how many have been from a direct result of lockdown, restrictions. Fear/stess being one of the biggest causes of heart attacks.

What if the test was a false positive? Which I'm convinced my hubbies was. He had a cold 100%. So the plasma would be useless, or is it more smoke &amp; mirrors?

1330220113962934276 2020-11-22 02:42:44 +0800 <skankyliar> My local news has urged people to go get tested for covid flu, if showing symptoms. Such as a runny nose. RUNNY NOSE!  In the winter. When was runny nose thrown into the mix? Everyone with a cold will be rushing for a test. Or should I say the brain dead will ü§¨

I also think you are being blinded to think that the constant drip of fear porn, had no effect on the deaths. I remember reading that suicides were around 30 a week, increasing to 30 a day. Then we had the care home managers

A trashed economy increases crime, poverty, less taxes results in cuts in the likes of the NHS. The Tories have cut over 17000 NHS beds, since being in power. All of which, increase deaths. Then there's the health damage caused from wearing a mask.

We are facing a double recession and thousands more deaths to boot.

1322591386068201472 2020-11-01 01:28:53 +0800 <skankyliar> @Reeben18 So you would refuse to wear one inside a hospital? Which is full of sick people?
1322585910874198022 2020-11-01 01:07:08 +0800 <skankyliar> @Reeben18 No. I was there recently and a mask is advised. I'm totally against masks but I wouldn't argue at wearing one when entering a building full of sick people. Who in the right mind would?

Because those I've spoken to have had enough. Then of course there are those that don't need to commute  because they have no job to commute to. Not sure they share your optimism.

Working from home is not all it's cracked up to be. It might have been fun for the first couple of months, but even those are struggling now. Struggling from isolation, distractions. Not

Do you think he will be thanked or even listened to, if he spoke out, based on his own experiences with covid. Just look at the crap we've endured trying to wake people up.

1319652771990208513 2020-10-23 22:51:53 +0800 <skankyliar> @ChrisWickNews I've heard this countless times. Mostly from the younger generation  Try wearing one all day when you reach 50, how forbid 70+ see if it's still not a problem.
1319652319936548864 2020-10-23 22:50:05 +0800 <skankyliar> @Walkabout24 Hard to sympathise. Who told anyone to walk the streets masked up? Who in the right mind thinks that is in anyway healthy.

1319648688092925952 2020-10-23 22:35:39 +0800 <skankyliar> So hubs doctor suggested he have a covid test. He went to docs for a pain in his side, yes he's showing cold like symptoms.

How can you be auto be a covid death after 28 days of testing positive, if there is no record of you seeking medical assistance for covi after a positive test. Most that test positive are just told to stay home no med assistance needed.

I would have expected further investigation, a prescription to avoid the virus worsening. But all I hear is, you've tested positive to a deadly virus, off you tottle home. That's  unheard of for a deadly disease
1316124708501323779 2020-10-14 05:12:37 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo He shut down 23rd or 25th. You say infection rates are worse now, not sure how that can be determined as we weren't testing on this scale back then. Judging by the over 200k now reported to have been infected, I find it odd that there's no meds given, no x rays or further doc
1316123977547481093 2020-10-14 05:09:43 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo That's what I said, not all those that died, died after 3 weeks like you suggested, some may have not made the night. Death has a very varied timescale.
1316123605311401984 2020-10-14 05:08:14 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo So you are suggesting that all normal care home deaths stopped during March-July and they all become covid deaths? How would that work then?
1316122996013248513 2020-10-14 05:05:49 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo No, the order was cancelled because they weren't needed. Nothing to do with how complex they are. Dyson was ready to go.the order was cancelled.
1316122726738939904 2020-10-14 05:04:45 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo But not every patient lasted 3 weeks, that's what I'm saying. Deaths started to rise 2 weeks after we locked down. According to ONS anyway.
1316122396596867072 2020-10-14 05:03:26 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo My sister had pnemonia late last year, she was struggling to breath, which is very much a obvious symptom of covid, so easily to confuse the two. Both leave similar long term damage I believe?
1316121929481412612 2020-10-14 05:01:35 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo 60k but then you've to remove the low end of 21k, then the 12 or 17k care home deaths, so it's already greatly reduced.
1316121143678570497 2020-10-14 04:58:27 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo Strange that because a whistleblowing nurse in USA stated that was very much the case. Not something many would want to admit, because it then falls under negligence. The orders the hundreds of ventilators were dropped pretty quickly weren't they.

1316119606625435653 2020-10-14 04:52:21 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo So why were so many practically empty.
1316119197957656578 2020-10-14 04:50:43 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo Not everyone dies in 2-3 weeks. The already weak would die much quicker. Then of course we have those that were ventilated, which we now know, was killing covid patients. So your original 60k is getting smaller. What with lockdiwn, care homes, ventilators.
1316118539812704265 2020-10-14 04:48:06 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo I'm sure it was horrific, working in ITU is horrific. But there were plenty of other beds vacant that could have been used for other than covid.
1316118151910879234 2020-10-14 04:46:34 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo Hospitals did close down, cancer treatments, everything else stopped. People were told to avoid going to hospital because they were bursting, which wasn't true.
1316117692315774982 2020-10-14 04:44:44 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo Apparently not! Previously you saud decisions have to be made, so some people were denied. How can you say he left it too late if the death figures before lock down were normal?
1316117126919393280 2020-10-14 04:42:29 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo So I will go back to my original point, which was that 60k dud not die from covid. Around 12k elderly were left to die, low end of 21k died from the lockdown, over 50% more people died at home, over 50% more people took their own lives!
1316116485727752193 2020-10-14 04:39:57 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo Because ive heard from so many that were left with little to do, taking in games, playing on phones. I'm now curious on what hospital you work at, and how you witnessed something different.
1316116042213732353 2020-10-14 04:38:11 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo Not at all. I never mentioned those being kicked out of hospital, I'm talking about hospitals closing it's doors, those in care homes not worthy of being transferred into hospital when they needed medical attention.Those at home being left fearful from the non stop fear mongering
1316114991846772736 2020-10-14 04:34:00 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo My point was that before we locked down, no more people than the average weekly were dying. So something went very wrong after we locked down. And we know what that was, hospitals shut their doors.
1316114351192002560 2020-10-14 04:31:28 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo So you're going to ignore my question? Not everyone in a care home is over 90. I'm talking about the blanket DNR put on them. They weren't worthy of taking to hospital to save!
1316113351018270722 2020-10-14 04:27:29 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo What hospital was that?

1316112467404169216 2020-10-14 04:23:59 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo So by putting a blanket DNR on all those in care homes, was that not sending thousands into graves?
1316110974815023104 2020-10-14 04:18:03 +0800 <skankyliar> @WarriorBrexit @thecommonmanuk @therealmissjo No it's not a hard call, if there's data to show that over 21k died as a direct result of lockdown in 4 months, you don't make that mistake again! .

Your not gonna have a heart attack, go to hospital, get tested and refused help because you've tested positive. Some could even be day cases. Stop trying to scare people.

Spain introduced masks all out doors, cases still increased. But flu kills thousands more, do they not count? Wouldn't you want to protect those too?
1314964550492532737 2020-10-11 00:22:34 +0800 <skankyliar> @AlistairHaimes Same where I live. Never known so many people to be off work during early Feb with a flu like virus.

1313784732812013568 2020-10-07 18:14:23 +0800 <skankyliar> @DrCharlesL @IVOTEDLEAVE3 Because the NHS has been closes again and the media are terrifying people to get medical help when needed, others are taking their own lives because of the constant scaremongering.

1313734077040783364 2020-10-07 14:53:06 +0800 <skankyliar> @grizzlefizzle @emmakennytv Deaths. Summer months we average between 9-10k each week. That's remained the same. We actually had 3 months below average. But come Nov that will increase from anything between 10-13k a week. It happens every year. The only spike we saw was during lockdown, which is no surprise

The great majority of deaths were over 70-80, most of which who were already on their way, some helped along by throwing the Kung Flu into their care homes.

You should be first in line for the vaccine. Those of without the mask will waiver our rights to one to ensure there's enough to go round.

1312066847672541184 2020-10-03 00:28:08 +0800 <skankyliar> @AlistairHaimes Imagine how many people were literally scared to death because of the graph they showed. What was the point of it when it's not factual. Project fear, as if people hadn't had enough. ü§¨
1312065999454298113 2020-10-03 00:24:45 +0800 <skankyliar> @vrw123 @Anshul__K Maybe Londoners have more sense and only go when they've got symptoms. Our test station  looks like it's there for a while, it not a pop up one.

1312062641913946113 2020-10-03 00:11:25 +0800 <skankyliar> @MBreeg @nicolawitch I'm sure the peak was dreadful when over 21k were dying from non covid. Your uncle was already in a weakened position, normal flu or MRSA could have pushed him over the edge. The point is that many hospitals were close to empty whilst people were dying at home.
1312061932355104768 2020-10-03 00:08:36 +0800 <skankyliar> @nicolawitch I had 7 nurses waiting on me a month ago. They said they didn't understand what was going on either.

1312060208034783240 2020-10-03 00:01:45 +0800 <skankyliar> @Anshul__K But thousands commute through London. I still think if they were testing to this scale, back then we would see similar figures.

The vaccine is not the silver bullet. Patrick Vallance saud this 2 wks ago. It's going to be like the flu vaccine, only works on 14%, so you are going to be disappointed if you think normal will resume.
1312046319947649030 2020-10-02 23:06:33 +0800 <skankyliar> @TraceyC20373474 I think its a scam. Question is why?

Excess deaths are registered at year end, as we not quite there, you can only calculate to date. To date, no country is likely to be seeing a significant rise, to show a deadly pandemic.

1312042646467235840 2020-10-02 22:51:58 +0800 <skankyliar> @matthewfreer @frasier89 @blablue86 @AlisonBlunt It to be right. Time will tell, like I had said. You haven't proven me wrong regards experts because I have not checked up on that. But I will. So..

What do you mean phemonia? I said that 2 nurses told me they had seen a rise in bacterial pnemonia recently, and they have put it down to masks. You've not proven me wrong and I've not proven
1312041736336822273 2020-10-02 22:48:21 +0800 <skankyliar> @matthewfreer @frasier89 @blablue86 @AlisonBlunt It was originally printed in the Daily Telegraph. They claimed to have seen data. But we were told that 50% more people were dying at home, well obviously if your going to shut down the NHS and fill people with fear to go seek help.

1312040985766113280 2020-10-02 22:45:22 +0800 <skankyliar> @matthewfreer @frasier89 @blablue86 @AlisonBlunt This year. Same with UK, we had 3 months with below average weekly deaths, because the virus killed them a little sooner, but they still would have likely died this year. This happens every year. That's why excess deaths should be calculated  year end.

But I still fail to understand how you can have a killer virus, yet see no more  deaths than usual. Of course it could have seen people die a little sooner, but still likely to have died

One shop, one mask if you are going to remove it. 90% mask wearers shouldn't bother.

They are constantly playing the Hokey Cokey with the thing, and then they are fiddling with the fruit &amp; veg. Mask wearers are most likely to be contaminating things. Watch them.

I've told you Sweden has an average of 90.000 deaths yearly, they are currently under 70.000. Other causes of death haven't stopped. The UK saw over 21k deaths in 4 months. All from the lockdown, nothing to do with covid. All avoidable.

If we are talking hand to mouth, mask wearers are a bigger threat. Masks on chins, constantly fiddling with a already contaminated mask you've spent 20mins breathing into.
1312032175034859523 2020-10-02 22:10:21 +0800 <skankyliar> @matthewfreer @frasier89 @blablue86 @AlisonBlunt No not wearing them for a ten min trip to the shops and then throwing them, but people aren't throwing them away. They are reusing them over &amp; over. But I would imagine the higher risk is amongst those wearing them in the street.

Some have even challenged the Goverment on-air.  Yet the Goverment haven't taken them up. Surely you can't have to many experts. God knows the ones they are listening too have got it so wrong so far.
1312030535695425543 2020-10-02 22:03:50 +0800 <skankyliar> @matthewfreer @frasier89 @blablue86 @AlisonBlunt So maybe you could run me through the " I wear a mask to protect you"  so if your wearing a mask and your droplets are contained within that mask. If I'm not wearing one, how do my droplets penetrate your mask? So it works one way, but not another ü§£ü§£

1312029251856674816 2020-10-02 21:58:44 +0800 <skankyliar> @matthewfreer @frasier89 @blablue86 @AlisonBlunt I would suggest it was longer, because we artificially supressed it.

If my car breaks down and I'm quoted thousands that would hit me financially. I would get a second opinion. Surely doing something as serious as destroying our economy would warrant a 2nd opinion.

Toxins our body doesn't want. You are containing them toxins within your mask, inhaling them all over again. Not to mention the cross contamination from handling the thing.
1312027574508359680 2020-10-02 21:52:04 +0800 <skankyliar> @matthewfreer @frasier89 @blablue86 @AlisonBlunt But a cough/sneeze can be as spontaneous as a fart. Not only that, you are containing warm exhaled air in a mask, obviously bacteria is going to grow as it becomes more warm/moist.

You can't compare monthly or weekly because flu season can start later or earlier, end later or earlier. That is why excess deaths are calculated at end of year. Summer can kill just as many elderly.

When (for instance) Pro J Van Tam saud that he didn't recommend the wearing of masks amongst healthy people.  15yrs expert knowledge. Did you believe him? Did you believe Jenny Harris when she also advised against, saying it could be more risky?

You can not calculate excess deaths in the first few months of a year, and certainly not during flu season. Excess deaths can only be calculated at end of year.

1309528953510653954 2020-09-26 00:23:27 +0800 <skankyliar> @HSJEditor Why are you trying to scare people? Have other causes of death dropped significantly then, because deaths have either been below average (for some 3 mths) or the average. You're not helping people with their anxiety.

1309525939240525824 2020-09-26 00:11:28 +0800 <skankyliar> @HSJEditor What's the norm for this time of year? At least put something to compare. Is the reason you're not, because those figures are normal for the time of year. Or maybe because it's lower. A bid more transparency will go along way. üëç Failing to do so, is scaremongering!

1309501181710999552 2020-09-25 22:33:05 +0800 <skankyliar> @HSJEditor Would help if the tests were more reliable. These people might have tested positive but be in hospital for something totally different. Hospitals have been operating at less than half normal capacity, if course admissions will rise as the catch up begins, deaths have been below

So who are we actually saving?

It's not the poor buggers in the care homes, it's not those waiting for life saving cancer treatment, it's not the business owners who are set to lose everything they've built, it's not those constantly being left fearful from the constant

1308144819525607424 2020-09-22 04:43:23 +0800 <skankyliar> @robinjescott @janekin24 You say that because you're not that sitting duck inside a care home, isolated 24/7 denied those you love. To do that, you might aswell kill them now!

1308144317349924875 2020-09-22 04:41:24 +0800 <skankyliar> @robinjescott @janekin24 We are already gambling with lives, from other illnesses, from poverty from fear from isolation.

A vaccine isn't coming soon, if it came too soon, that could be more depremental, so we need to live along side it.
1308143292845088768 2020-09-22 04:37:19 +0800 <skankyliar> @robinjescott @janekin24 I wish there was so much concern for all other causes of death. We do not need another lockdown, I guarantee you, if we do, we will see far more deaths. At some point we need to take responsibility for our own mortality. If I'm in the vulnerable group, I take precautions needed.

1308141300684906498 2020-09-22 04:29:24 +0800 <skankyliar> @robinjescott @janekin24 Then let's stop wasting money and spend that money shielding the vulnerable. If that's what they wish. People want a life, not an existence.

There is so much more to this than bloody covid!

Pensioners afraid to turn the heating on. This goes much bigger than just a virus with a lower fatality rate if that of flu.

We never went into a lockdown, the virus was still circulating, yet still deaths are low in comparison. So we ignore all the biggest causes of deaths to protect others from covid. Is that what your

1307988864435445762 2020-09-21 18:23:41 +0800 <skankyliar> Of course hospital admissions are rising since April. More than half of the NHS was shut down back then, as it reopens, more admissions. More and more BULSHIT!!

1307982222616649728 2020-09-21 17:57:17 +0800 <skankyliar> @GwynneThomson @theblogmire @ClarkeMicah You could say we saw more excess deaths in 2018 than those in 2016.
1307981560382193664 2020-09-21 17:54:39 +0800 <skankyliar> @GwynneThomson @theblogmire @ClarkeMicah I have the weekly figures for the last 5yrs in front of me! No same week is the same each year. This is why you can not calculate excess deaths until the year end. Yes we do know what was causing the deaths. Lockdown. Lockdown killed more than the virus.
1307977914810609665 2020-09-21 17:40:10 +0800 <skankyliar> @GwynneThomson @theblogmire @ClarkeMicah Flu season can drag out until May on a bad year.
1307977776713142272 2020-09-21 17:39:37 +0800 <skankyliar> @GwynneThomson @theblogmire @ClarkeMicah Nope! I used flu season as an example. Flu season can be shorter or longer, it can start sooner/later.  The point is, that we  will see no more deaths than previous years, such as 2018.
1307976319775453186 2020-09-21 17:33:50 +0800 <skankyliar> @GwynneThomson @theblogmire @ClarkeMicah Nope! It's how many deaths occurred from week one until 7th Sept the last 5 yrs. 2020 excess deaths are lowering each month. That's why excess deaths shouldn't be calculated until year end. Because flu season may start earlier some years compared to others, it might last longer.

But if you look at my pinned tweet, we are on the same projection as 2018, had those 21k hadn't died unnecessarily from lockdown, we could have been lower than the flu epidemic in 2018.

1307717699800363017 2020-09-21 00:26:10 +0800 <skankyliar> @RogervandeVelde @BreesAnna Probably because evidence was lacking. We had no dead bodies to step over here.

1307667074748231680 2020-09-20 21:05:00 +0800 <skankyliar> @JamieKay22 Well you would, I'm white. My niece is married to a lovely black man. They have 2 beautiful children. He too is a teacher, he's a head teacher in fact. He's also managed to do well for himself.

It's really not as exclusive to the black communities as you might think. Bit I'm more interested I  how you managed to defy the odds, and I'm sure the white privileges to be a teacher.

1307663171839315968 2020-09-20 20:49:30 +0800 <skankyliar> @JamieKay22 So you can't explain why you consider people racists. I see you're a teacher. Dud you get that job because you are black, or because you studied hard, regardless of the white resistance I'm sure you experienced.
1307662328230535168 2020-09-20 20:46:08 +0800 <skankyliar> @JamieKay22 No I'm genuinely interested.

And your evidence to support just one life being saved? Deaths outside hospital rose 50% as did suicide. So no, no lives were saved!

Thousands were still working, packing out the parks, beaches. But what we did do was kill over 21000 in 4 months from closing the hospitals and filling people with fear. https://t.co/1smW7eqbFM
1306969119326076928 2020-09-18 22:51:35 +0800 <skankyliar> @Dust_Foot @ClarkeMicah Actually, we saw lower deaths at the point of lockdown in 2018, 15000 less. So unsure as to why we even locked down. Deaths only rose after locking down and started to fall 8 wks later as we began easing out. Since then deaths have fallen. So that's very much what happened.
1306968234252537858 2020-09-18 22:48:03 +0800 <skankyliar> @ClarkeMicah Hospitals were running at below 40% of course admissions are increasing. üòÇ

1306966851948359680 2020-09-18 22:42:34 +0800 <skankyliar> @Dust_Foot @ClarkeMicah But if you've any logical explanation as to why we have been experiencing lower than average deaths for over 3 mths, during a deadly pandemic, or no more deaths seen in 2018 when covid wasn't invented, I would like to hear that.
1306966411709952003 2020-09-18 22:40:49 +0800 <skankyliar> @Dust_Foot @ClarkeMicah Very few were actually ill with covid in March. Hence why hospitals were empty and nurses furloughed or put on short time work. But over 21k did die from lockdown over 4 months. Who's to say if we weren't testing to this scale back in March that case figures wouldn't be this high
1306965138520629249 2020-09-18 22:35:45 +0800 <skankyliar> I would have more respect for @MattHancock And @BorisJohnson If they cut out the bullshit and told us what's really going on. Until that happens, I will not be complying with any future restrictions. Fine me, I won't pay.
1306961823976042498 2020-09-18 22:22:35 +0800 <skankyliar> @Dust_Foot @ClarkeMicah Still might not be in hospital with covid related illness, just that they've tested positive. I read about a clinician that tested positive 2 mths after having the virus, he wasn't aware he had.
1306960924289400833 2020-09-18 22:19:01 +0800 <skankyliar> @Dust_Foot @ClarkeMicah But we also need to remember that people are testing positive, even though they are showing no symptoms and also from having the virus weeks, if not before. So they might still not be in hospital for covid related illness, but they still need to be tested, as I had to before op.

1306955591793991687 2020-09-18 21:57:49 +0800 <skankyliar> @Dust_Foot @ClarkeMicah Who saying cases are rising, they could have been this high if we were testing to this scale back in April. Death figures are below average, have been for months.

Maybe ask yourself if so few are actually ill out if these new cases, if we were to have tested to this scale in April, would we have same figures.

1306923864459444226 2020-09-18 19:51:45 +0800 <skankyliar> @ClarkeMicah Let's not forget that the hospitals haven't been working at full capacity for 6 mths, think it was around 40%, so as heads towards normal admissions will increase.

But it gives you an idea, but that 37k figure lowers each month, and we also need to take into account data seen by the Telegraph that claimed between April-July we saw over 21k non covid

1303719987530563586 2020-09-09 23:40:41 +0800 <skankyliar> @ViolaGreenwood @BenIrvineAuthor Ever thought that maybe what happened in China was total fakery. Why would the Chinese population shout FAKE, ITS ALL FAKE from the tower blocks they were locked into. The pictures of people dropping dead in the street were most definitely faked. Why would they need to do that?
1303717285371228160 2020-09-09 23:29:57 +0800 <skankyliar> @ViolaGreenwood @BenIrvineAuthor Or maybe you have a reasonable explanation as to why they have chosen to ignore valid points that have been raised. They can hardly be classed as a oversight. Why did they not just follow Sweden? Might have saved a few thousand lives. Whatever is going on, China in involved.
1303715891050405888 2020-09-09 23:24:24 +0800 <skankyliar> @ViolaGreenwood @BenIrvineAuthor How can I say no, after all we've witnessed. Either they are totally incompetent or they are following orders. That's why the opposition &amp; msm remain so silent. More interested in whipping up racial hatred.
1303715272046579712 2020-09-09 23:21:57 +0800 <skankyliar> @ViolaGreenwood @BenIrvineAuthor Whilst hospitals are lay, pretty much empty. Or maybe the amount of new cases are not being represented in hospital admissions. Or maybe, why were death certificates being falsified?
1303714857515130881 2020-09-09 23:20:18 +0800 <skankyliar> @ViolaGreenwood @BenIrvineAuthor So any ideas as to why they would totally chose to ignore the lack of reliability of the tests, or the fact that we aren't really seeing more deaths than previous years.  Not really the outcome expected from a deadly virus outbreak. Or maybe why is vital treatment being stopped.
1303713618614259712 2020-09-09 23:15:23 +0800 <skankyliar> @RealCarlVernon I'm surprised Katie Price hasn't had it. There's still time I guess.

1303711219493285889 2020-09-09 23:05:51 +0800 <skankyliar> @ViolaGreenwood @BenIrvineAuthor You think! You shut down the hospitals and fill people with fear 24/7. I would suggest it's at least 30k avoidable deaths .
1303709837012987906 2020-09-09 23:00:21 +0800 <skankyliar> @BenIrvineAuthor I'm not convinced on a Chinese  bioterror act at all. The whole thing was staged &amp; fake imo. Even the Chinese citizens said it was. China set the scene of fakery. That is blatantly clear.
1303709214309789698 2020-09-09 22:57:53 +0800 <skankyliar> @ViolaGreenwood @BenIrvineAuthor Surely the low end of 21000 avoidable deaths during lockdown would signal what a catastrophic disaster their strategy was. The 21000 is also outdated now, possibly closer to 30k. Then we've the impact of those still waiting for life saving treatment denied.
1303691345006129158 2020-09-09 21:46:52 +0800 <skankyliar> @BenIrvineAuthor Do You still believe they buckled under pressure. At some point months ago when all us "Conspiracy Theorists" were pointing out things not adding up. They were alerted to the discrepancies, so could have changed course at any point and got us  out if it. They didn't! They know.
1303688815207485440 2020-09-09 21:36:49 +0800 <skankyliar> @simondolan Why were they getting tested without symptoms in the bleeding first place. Total morons!

1303633196517658625 2020-09-09 17:55:49 +0800 <skankyliar> @AlistairHaimes It still won't make any difference. Most of us know there is a issue with test results. Just as I'm sure the Goverment do. They are in control mode and nothing is going to stop it, until we stand together and say ENOUGH!
1303632749975285762 2020-09-09 17:54:02 +0800 <skankyliar> @RealDeniseWelch Saddened to hear, but totally understandable. If more people stepped back from social media and the msm. Their mood will lift &amp; lighten. Hope you're back soon. X
