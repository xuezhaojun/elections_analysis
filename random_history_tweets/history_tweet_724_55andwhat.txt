Loeffler private jet worth $25 million who paid for it GA tax payers.

We lost seats &amp; did not regain the senate.  I  am black mother and I get it I want better tomorrow but I don't want our words to make it harder to reach.

1325047308602499074 2020-11-07 20:07:51 +0800 <55andwhat> @keithedwards @ProjectLincoln She doesn't speak for the majority of the us,  we say thank you. Until she understands deep blue state she represents is not representative of the country,  she will continue this part. she help cost Dem  seats nationwide.
1325046391035539458 2020-11-07 20:04:12 +0800 <55andwhat> @AOC How many Purple or Red State have you helped flipped to Blue?

She will not win in purple states she doesn't get it, she is overrated. Again I like her, but she's just full of herself. Someone tell her New York is different from the rest of the country,  she will only win in New York.
1325038286994362369 2020-11-07 19:32:00 +0800 <55andwhat> @NYinLA2121 @AOC @ProjectLincoln She thinks New York is like the rest of the country.  Some of her talking point was used against majority of the Dems that ran in Texas and it cost us seats,  she needs to shut up this is not about her. I like but she beyond herself.
1325037524134342661 2020-11-07 19:28:58 +0800 <55andwhat> @AOC @ProjectLincoln WTH is wrong with you girl are you ok?

The socialist take over and defund the police hurt us in the house and even in some senate  seats that we were suppose to win. Dem need to focus on 50 state messaging  each state needs are different.

It even hurt people that was running for the 1st time with due respect @SpeakerPelosi those two issues cost us sits.

1324436207904894977 2020-11-06 03:39:33 +0800 <55andwhat> @BlueElection @AOC AOC will not win in Texas that is true, the Latinos here support more Republicans than Democrats or they don't vote.
1324435787308535815 2020-11-06 03:37:53 +0800 <55andwhat> @AOC We need unity we just won the WH. Dem will not win the deep South as long as we still have all that thinks American belongs to them.
