1334553049810022405 2020-12-04 01:40:16 +0800 <XRDRN_ORG> @jackbrookes PS we've been speaking to some researchers who have been exploring how to survey users inside Unity (VR). Is that something you plan on extending the UXF into?
1334521265911189506 2020-12-03 23:33:58 +0800 <XRDRN_ORG> @jackbrookes I'm a big fan of that project. It certainly feels like it should be discussed!

1334484470234304514 2020-12-03 21:07:45 +0800 <XRDRN_ORG> @Louise_Bryce That would be great! I imagine home hardware and conditions could be real concerns for remote listening.
1334474765705359360 2020-12-03 20:29:12 +0800 <XRDRN_ORG> Hello, we're looking for researchers to help run a CHI workshop discussion on how to run XR experiments with remote participants (we want to broaden the organisers beyond academics from one institution).  Please share, and reply to this message/DM if you would be interested.
