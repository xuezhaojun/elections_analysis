But these are leftist arseholes, who moan about "Western Imperialism," and things we did centuries ago. There is slavery going on in Libya yet no one is moaning about this. And as for "Britain`s wealth is built on slavery," that is absolute bullshit..

1301124068679319559 2020-09-02 19:45:26 +0800 <Ratillathehun> @kercle Obviously no one wants to deal with the worse pandemic for over a 100 years, but he`s also found out being PM isn`t what he thought it would be..
