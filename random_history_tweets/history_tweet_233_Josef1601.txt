The prophet

In my house we come together and share as it’s one of the few days everyone has off.   We celebrate the birth.   We do each day and we’ll do it that day.    Don’t lose the forest for the trees.
1342475696183062530 2020-12-25 22:22:02 +0800 <Josef1601> @InNotOfTheWorld Think opposite.   The fact that the whole world celebrates the birth of man born 2000 years ago in insignificant Bethlehem is a testament of God's power. Every KNEE will bow and confess Jesus is Lord to the glory of God, the father.  Philippians 2:10-11.  They're beginning now.
1342314106523701248 2020-12-25 11:39:56 +0800 <Josef1601> No one hates Christmas more than Satan and his synagogue.    Think about that.

1342291826984837121 2020-12-25 10:11:24 +0800 <Josef1601> @thisizwhack We were pagans until we were baptized.     Now, we celebrate the birth of Christ everyday and we will celebrate it today, tomorrow and the next day.   For the Gentiles, everyday before Christ was a pagan day.   After Christ, we went WOKE and broke the statutes.  The cross won.

1342145668299816963 2020-12-25 00:30:37 +0800 <Josef1601> Christmas is about a birth and not about a day.  Celebrate the birth that brought life to the dead, freedom to the slave, light to the lost, healing to the sick.  Thus, have a blessed CHRISTmore, Christmas.

1341850806413373447 2020-12-24 04:58:57 +0800 <Josef1601> Lindsey wanted to send $25,000,000 to Pakistan to promote the LBGTQ agenda.   Lindsey has been living in an open closet for decades.

Maranatha is still the best as many of their songs come straight from Scripture.  Bethel and Hillsong like to say we rise from the ashes of defeat...nonsense.  Thats pure occultism.  Ashes in the Bible are for repentance and repentance only.

It’s a good song...just doesn’t mention Jesus or God (on purpose) but it’s nice.     Don’t need to disagree further.   I’m not talking about exceptions but about the main.

Wish nothing more than not to have to call out ministries for deception.  Poor people.    Our lifespan is short but eternity is forever.    All we can do is pray for the lost and keep preaching.
1341575557344088064 2020-12-23 10:45:12 +0800 <Josef1601> @LifeToDryBones Preachers were still preaching then.     If you weren’t right, you get to church and get a good whooping in the word.    Those days are gone.  We’re in the age of gospel sugar.
1341574151669202949 2020-12-23 10:39:37 +0800 <Josef1601> Q is so blasphemous and occultic that I never bothered to deal with it.    This👇 is one of his most famous “drops”.  “Sheep no more” = we don’t follow Christ.    Why?  “The Lord is my SHEPHERD; I shall not want.” Psalms 23:1 KJV  Deception is subtle but deadly.

The Eagle secretly warred against God and His people and was supported by those who claimed to follow God.   A great multitude led by the Lion of Judah will destroy the Eagle.   The whole world will be in shock.

It is not to be accepted, followed or endured on the basis of money.   Should be simple to understand, correct?   Or do is there a point you want to make that I’m missing?

We are the living miracle of the work completed at the cross.    Many people go astray seeking “miracles”.  Be grateful for the one already given.

The greatest miracle was received at baptism when we went from death to life, sickness to health, defeat to victory.   Everyday and every breath is a miracle.    Just be grateful.   That’s the gospel.   That’s faith.
1339376533434150914 2020-12-17 09:07:04 +0800 <Josef1601> The gospel is not about money.   All we needed was provided at the cross.    Be grateful in all things.   Don’t give expecting to receive.     Be happy in just giving.

So, we can’t blame the old saints for something God kept hidden.   You take any passage w Henry and you will have an education as to what that text is really all about.
1339183179660480513 2020-12-16 20:18:45 +0800 <Josef1601> @LifeToDryBones @1YAHSTL Well, commentaries went downhill after Matthew Henry’s.   It’s one of the only ones I use and it’s from 1708!  Jesuits infiltrated and corrupted most theological colleges after the 1800s.   So, to get right, we have to go wayyyyy back.

1337800610851270665 2020-12-13 00:44:55 +0800 <Josef1601> If you think about it, an imperial presidency (dictatorship) needs to:  a.  Isolate the press as an enemy of the people;  b.  destroy the power of the legislative branch (they’re all corrupt), and;  c  reign in the power of the courts (the courts don’t work).   Those elements

1337583130891390976 2020-12-12 10:20:44 +0800 <Josef1601> @stevendenoon Just one ruling—ballot cutoff date or signature verification for example—will clear 90% of the outstanding grievances.    Also, the Court’s concern with its own legitimacy will be weighed against the public’s insistence of ensuring that only “legal” votes be counted.   65%.
1337581843470819329 2020-12-12 10:15:37 +0800 <Josef1601> @stevendenoon The lawsuits are already pending.    The Supremes have been extremely reluctant to intervene in elections since Bush v Gore.    Will they take up this case in light of the facts?   Don’t see how they don’t do something as the nation depends on the illusion of fair elections.

1336831697225211904 2020-12-10 08:34:48 +0800 <Josef1601> So, the easy and correct way, would be for the Supremes to say, the interests of the state are protected and no state can intervene in the internal affairs of another.   With Trump intervening in another case, the Supremes will consolidate the Trump filings like  Bush v Gore and
1336830491924815872 2020-12-10 08:30:01 +0800 <Josef1601> Standing has to do with the affected party’s right to redress.   Here, we have states stating that the electoral procedures in another state affect their citizens.   The problem is that in a constitutional republic, the interests of the state are protected by its representatives.
1336829887206871040 2020-12-10 08:27:36 +0800 <Josef1601> @Lulu57396823 The SC will accept the document. Standing will not be addressed at the filing stage.     Now, Trump intervened as a matter of right, so that, will cure that flaw.    All the other suits might cause the SC to deal with it, no matter how reluctant it might be.    Interesting stuff.

The only solid version remains the KJV.    You can also get an interliniar Bible to read the Greek/Hebrew text.

The New Testament was widely published and we have copies going back to the 1st-2nd Century.

Not to mention praying in the name of anyone else except the name of Jesus.

That curse is found in Deuteronomy 28:15-68.   That curse can apply to no other except the Black race.    So, we know that a primary cause for judgment of

Some historians documented that when he died, his body was filled with open sores that emitted pus.  Others wrote that he was poisoned.   Both groups agree that it was horrible.   His death gave rise to his son, the vile and wicked Caligula.

Not so in the US, where we enslaved and imported populations and 98% are not native to the land.   Thus, our culture and history is shallow and will not stand.

1332422625499504640 2020-11-28 04:34:43 +0800 <Josef1601> @semper_vincit US has been pushing for a war against Iran for sometime.  Sickening.
1332333291790356482 2020-11-27 22:39:44 +0800 <Josef1601> Israeli terrorism in real time.    What would happen if its scientists and top people suffer the same fate?     After all, what’s good for the goose....
1332330521993633794 2020-11-27 22:28:44 +0800 <Josef1601> Do the Iranían security services understand they’re in a war?
1332327272586616833 2020-11-27 22:15:49 +0800 <Josef1601> False flags come in all forms, shapes and sizes.  Most of the nation will rally behind the President’s “righteous cause”, that is after all, the intended effect.    Not many will ask:  “what if they set the election up to play out that way”?  Many see but few understand.

When the US begins to prosecute high executives of the CIA for drug trafficking, then it can demand other nations follow the example.   Brookings’ blind hypocrisy.

What punishment do you think this guy would propose for those families?   Gulag?  Re-education centers?  Prison?  Death?  Raging tyrants literally HATE their neighbors.  Sad people indeed.

My refusal to drink and speaking about ministry  became an irritant.  It ended up in a hellish rage...  Now, we pray and communicate  but keep our distance.  It is what it is.
1332126555309559810 2020-11-27 08:58:15 +0800 <Josef1601> @2_BEAST_SYSTEMS Proud of you and your wife.  My real brother and sister in Christ.

For example, during Halloween they got a lesson on the day (Martin Luther, the Reformation, the anti-Reformation, etc).   We celebrate Christ and His triumph over all.  So, it’s a great time for us.

Much of the population will be petrified and will demand all get vaccinated. Those that don’t, will be hated and treated as existential threats.    The will kill and think they’re saving humanity.

1331573431175958528 2020-11-25 20:20:20 +0800 <Josef1601> If true, we are in worse shape than previously thought.   It basically means that the military will enforce our election laws. Perhaps that’s why they’re pushing the Chavez angle, to justify the war/military rhetoric.   They’re calling for dictatorship.

Nevertheless, there’s only one last great power that was called the “hammer of the earth”, the “hindermost” of nations.    Babylon’s pulpits would be corrupted and her people deceived until the Great slaughter.    Knowing is our red pill.

One of the primary points is understanding the criticism, I.e., is not America and how the Bible clearly refutes it.     Now, let’s concede that Babylon also has a spiritual component-Rome and
1330131205841424384 2020-11-21 20:49:26 +0800 <Josef1601> To accomplish that, we have to spend time studying the subject.  Unfortunately, there’s a dearth of scholarship on the issue as for decades, ALL “Christian” publishing in the US has been under the influence of those who hate Christ.

One of the primary failures is not to teach on the role of America in the end times.  We must understand how the scriptures were interpreted historically.

1329101724947243010 2020-11-19 00:38:39 +0800 <Josef1601> @Eyes4theProfane Had to block that guy.  Incessant  arguments over basic stuff.
1329097703486337029 2020-11-19 00:22:40 +0800 <Josef1601> @FinalEvangelist Ok brother.   We see things differently and I’m not spending my time debating basic issues with you.  We can agree to disagree.
1329097349944270850 2020-11-19 00:21:16 +0800 <Josef1601> @FinalEvangelist @Eyes4theProfane Stop using verses out of context.  There’s a big difference between someone being restrained by the power of government from working and someone not willing to work.
1329094966820429825 2020-11-19 00:11:48 +0800 <Josef1601> Because Jesus said, pick up your M16 and go after them.

And even if He would not supply on earth, He has already supplied through the cross.  By faith, we already have more than we need.   I don’t know what’s going with you but your tone and combativeness is uncalled for.

1328762223385305088 2020-11-18 02:09:35 +0800 <Josef1601> Old saying “Pigs get slaughtered”.    Meaning:   In negotiations, sometimes it’s better to be flexible than to walk away with less than what it was proposed.    Many attorneys fall into this trap during litigation.   It’s the failure of an honest assessment.   With God also.

Paul was inspired to address this generation.    “Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,” Romans 1:22 KJV  Hang in there...we all have family just like that.

1328086127870357507 2020-11-16 05:23:02 +0800 <Josef1601> @longinus2020 After the flood, the corruption continued that’s why we have “sons of Belial”, “sons of Satan”,  “serpents”, “wheat and tares”, “sons of perdition”, etc.     So are ALL descendants of Eden?   Yes to most.   But the corrupted seed of Satan still exists, thrives and conspires.
1328085087246823425 2020-11-16 05:18:54 +0800 <Josef1601> @longinus2020 BUT before and after the flood, the seed of man was corrupted.     Before the flood, with fallen angels:  “That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.” Genesis 6:2 KJV
1328084542444482562 2020-11-16 05:16:44 +0800 <Josef1601> @longinus2020 that every one that findeth me shall slay me.” Genesis 4:14 KJV  So, we are clear that Adam/Eve were first but the Bible is SILENT as to the possibility that God created others upon the earth.    Thus, it accounts for Cain’s concern that “every one” will slay him.
1328083956886073346 2020-11-16 05:14:24 +0800 <Josef1601> @longinus2020 in chapter 4, after he slew Able, Cain is concerned about those who find him:  “Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass,

First the authority:  “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.” Genesis 1:27 KJV  “Created he them”.  Plural.    Was it only one couple?  That’s interesting because

1327433640956071938 2020-11-14 10:10:17 +0800 <Josef1601> @narrowgate23 Race is all over the Bible.   Racists are excluded from grace.  Very different.

1327427767546355712 2020-11-14 09:46:56 +0800 <Josef1601> @aprilhendrix9 Jerusalem was rightfully destroyed in 70 ad.  The population that remained Hebrew/Christian evolved into what we now know/Palestine.  The White Jewish settlers, are from East Europe, Bolsheviks, communists, from the land of Gog/Magog. They invaded the land. They’re Satan’s army.
1327425993825509386 2020-11-14 09:39:53 +0800 <Josef1601> Done posting tonight.   My family says that speaking my mind is why I hardly have friends.   Yeah.   Sorry we read.  Sorry we study. Sorry we think.   We just don’t belong in Babylon.    “Now then we are ambassadors for Christ.. 2 Cor.  5:20 KJV  We don’t belong.
1327422263570919425 2020-11-14 09:25:04 +0800 <Josef1601> Posted historical evidence 10 times now.   Not doing it again. They can go down my posts and get it but I realize that many have done a better job documenting these facts.    We’re gonna laugh at all those who look down at others because of the color of their skin.  Fools.
1327422262635532288 2020-11-14 09:25:04 +0800 <Josef1601> Don’t delete your dumb statement before I get to respond.   Jesus was Black, the prophets were Black, the apostles were Black and all you racists need to repent.   Those are historical FACTS and application to such!    Is that clear?  https://t.co/lrjyWtlaWR
1327419507154046976 2020-11-14 09:14:07 +0800 <Josef1601> Send me a pic with a metro sexual sweet thing of a Jesus and be blocked instantly.  I’ve posted HISTORICAL documentation of what he looked like.    All say he was BLACK.   You can’t get to heaven being with pride or a proud boy.   We have to be humble and repent.  Get it?  https://t.co/8GbRZuEP0u
1327418548868812800 2020-11-14 09:10:18 +0800 <Josef1601> Nothing, and I mean nothing, gets more reaction than the historical fact that the Amiens Hebrews and Jesus were Black.    I mean, we have the Bible, right?  Don’t people open it?  Open and study your Bible, you blind fool.   Your prejudice will get you a ticket to hell.  https://t.co/V01WDJzzcu

1327411730054606856 2020-11-14 08:43:13 +0800 <Josef1601> @SBlovd Yeah. Just because you say so.  You know better than Josephus and the historical documents.  And the BIBLE tells you so.   You stiff necked blind people.  Everything you’ve learned is a lie.  You live in an lie and embrace a lie.    What does God has to do with you?
1327407096111960065 2020-11-14 08:24:48 +0800 <Josef1601> @KellyHanna1 Yeap. I’m not here for those that know it all.  I’m here for those that want to learn.    Yehoshua was Black.  That’s a historical fact.    Anything else?
1327406294496669696 2020-11-14 08:21:37 +0800 <Josef1601> Yeah.   Just in case we have forgotten.   The Bible was never a White man’s book.  It was always a Black man’s book for the salvation of the world.   What you going to do when you find out it’s all about our Black neighbors?  Don’t stay stupid. Study and see what’s up.
1327405032938082309 2020-11-14 08:16:36 +0800 <Josef1601> @JonahofNinevah @LinkerBkb Absolutely!  But it’s too subtle for most.   There were some close ups of the handshake/grip on the internet but I can no longer find them!
1327404334754246658 2020-11-14 08:13:50 +0800 <Josef1601> Y’all better be nice to your Black neighbor.   Better study folks.  Bible is of the Blacks for Blacks.   Jesus, Peter, Paul, Steven, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Isaiah, Moses were BLACK.   Just saying.  You racist might kill them. They don’t care.  They passing through.   U KKKep it all.
1327401619655421952 2020-11-14 08:03:02 +0800 <Josef1601> @KellyHanna1 Jesus was and is a Hebrew. But do you know who were and are the Hebrews?👇   Better be nice to your Black neighbor!

Well, I’m a bit older and traveled to various nations as a child.   It became evident really early that not everything was as it was taught.    I’ve been called a conspiracy theorist for decades.  Now, thankfully, the empire has been exposed to all.   We all know.

1326932702415753218 2020-11-13 00:59:44 +0800 <Josef1601> @3rd_abraham Like in the days of Noah:  And God looked upon the earth and saw that it was CORRUPT; for all living creatures on the earth had corrupted their ways.… Gen. 6:11  "Corrupt" is also the word for "ruined".   Messing with God's DNA, creation is to RUIN His perfect work.

Leaders who sincerely want a good relationship, stay silent.   Those that congratulate are purposefully destabilizing the US.
1325397878316130304 2020-11-08 19:20:53 +0800 <Josef1601> What makes this so abominable is that Netanyahu is the welfare queen who gets everything he wants from Rabbi Trump.  Should TRUMP prevail, there will be hell to pay.

It's a cartoon presenting the current and future state of affairs through symbolism and occultic themes.     You will need to see a few videos decoding it to grasp some of the meaning.

1325378405479686144 2020-11-08 18:03:30 +0800 <Josef1601> The list can go on for a page or two as Trump can’t say a sentence without lying.    He presided over the biggest wealth transfer from the poor to the rich and the destruction of the US economy (we haven’t felt full effects).  Still, they won’t steal his throne.

1325362463538352128 2020-11-08 17:00:10 +0800 <Josef1601> For two decades now, NATO’s war on Christianity was engaged covertly in the Middle East.  Largely successful there, it now openly rises against Armenia.    Thus, Turkey has been given the green light to continue the genocide of 1914-1923.
1325291324598345729 2020-11-08 12:17:29 +0800 <Josef1601> @JarmanPhilip They forget Trump is still a sitting president with all the powers of the executive branch.   Wrong man to double cross.

Why?   Because they will bury him as soon as they get in power.   It will be tax/fraud/corruption case after case.  He won’t make it.

1325055408059392008 2020-11-07 20:40:02 +0800 <Josef1601> As predicted, the foundation of fraud has been laid and established.    That’s all that’s needed to ensure audits and forensic analysis of the ballots.   Effect: Trump resurrection.  Radical left revolts with extreme violence.  Martial law invoked.   US becomes war zone.
1324955366334099457 2020-11-07 14:02:30 +0800 <Josef1601> Don’t forget, the real powers all sit at the table and divide the spoils.  They’re not Democrats nor Republicans, they’re just predators.     We’re the meal.   When those with means and ability say they’re seeking depopulation, it’s not a joke.

1324891053007179782 2020-11-07 09:46:56 +0800 <Josef1601> State by state:  Step one:  segregate ballots.  Step two:  physical verification of physical ballots.  Step three:  verification of eligibility.   Tedious and exhausting work NEEDED to legitimize the (se)election.

The fact you feel that way is clear evidence that God is working in you and the enemy wants to defeat you.   The closer you get to God, the harder the battle.
1324860458256527360 2020-11-07 07:45:22 +0800 <Josef1601> @Reptoid_Hunter Beautiful!   I fell from grace Paul.  My worst enemy was guilt and shame.   Do t give up.  Get up tomorrow, pray, thank God for His son and for His grace and do it all over again.   And when you’re down, remember how he suffered for us.   He suffered because He loves us.
1324860061416640513 2020-11-07 07:43:48 +0800 <Josef1601> @Reptoid_Hunter The same God who created the heavens and the earth made a path of forgiveness though faith in His son.    Believe, repent and be baptized.  That’s all it takes.    “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.” Mark 16:16 KJV
1324859505008664580 2020-11-07 07:41:35 +0800 <Josef1601> @Reptoid_Hunter Paul felt the same despair:  “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” Romans 7:24 KJV  Remember: “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;” Romans 3:23 KJV  It’s not by what we do, accept forgiveness by His grace.

Tough, tough days ahead for sure.   This is our color revolution.    The problem for all of us is that we don't want a desperate US.   Many people will die.
1324717604645281794 2020-11-06 22:17:43 +0800 <Josef1601> to fight back.     Expect evidence of fraud, court filings, reluctant state judges and cases moving to federal jurisdiction.   Once in federal, the argument is simple:  ineligible voters disfranchise legal votes and permeate the proceedings with fraud and illegitimacy. The end.
1324717603848441856 2020-11-06 22:17:43 +0800 <Josef1601> Today's world is different.   Presidents will not just bow out graciously like Nixon in Watergate.   The Watergate lesson was to fight until the end.  So, if there is evidence of fraud, and there will be, then expect the sitting president to utilize all of levers of power.
1324714753156145156 2020-11-06 22:06:23 +0800 <Josef1601> @sofinique1 Trump is not going away.   We can speculate as to how it will go down but it will go down.     They can't commit fraud against a SITTING president.  The man has all the levers of power.   It's not going to end well.   Just as intended.

Daniel also describes as the “god if fortresses” or the god of arms, armaments, force.    Interesting that that US military is so dear to DJT.   That’s all loves, military might, force.
1324091383100170240 2020-11-05 04:49:20 +0800 <Josef1601> @FinalRegulator @Whoyagottatweet The Hebrew word means “regard, respect, honor.” Not gay.  Further, the “Jewish” requirement is not clearly biblical.   Even if it is, there’s plenty of documentation attesting to Trump’s Jewish lineage through his mother, which meets the requieren-they refer 2 DJT as “messiah”.

1323289506620035072 2020-11-02 23:42:58 +0800 <Josef1601> @Mr_JayHood7 Sometime the Devil needs a good butt whooping.
1323288653976797185 2020-11-02 23:39:35 +0800 <Josef1601> Trump worshippers blaspheme and have no shame in doubling down.  If they can't tell the difference between King David and Trump, then we can't help them.
1323279687624220672 2020-11-02 23:03:57 +0800 <Josef1601> @tomkwill Exactly.   People will be selling their sons and daughters to the perversity of the Satanic rich.
1323256990446030850 2020-11-02 21:33:46 +0800 <Josef1601> Maybe because they were injected with viruses, cancers, and poisons since the birth of modern medicine!  Begin the research with the Tuskegee syphilis experiments and continue to Dr. Cornelius Rhodas.     They have NO reason to trust this poison.    https://t.co/J4LvNgiG04
1323243584116674560 2020-11-02 20:40:29 +0800 <Josef1601> The more we suffer, the more they make.   Satanic to the core.
1323239595291611138 2020-11-02 20:24:38 +0800 <Josef1601> @ForeignPolicy @jshermcyber You guys are a bunch of hypocrites.
1323239528086331392 2020-11-02 20:24:22 +0800 <Josef1601> As Twitter, YT, Facebook, Patreon, Bichute, Reddit shut down thousands of channels...  And the MSM suppresses truth about war, Covid, the real economy, the apartheid state, FP 👇 blames other countries.    Hypocrisy 101.
1323237973601771520 2020-11-02 20:18:12 +0800 <Josef1601> The American church is drowning in false theology, pride and arrogance.   It thinks that it will be “saved” from the judgment this nation richly deserves.    Not happening.    Most of the judgment coming is BECAUSE of the apostate American church.
1323235491706187776 2020-11-02 20:08:20 +0800 <Josef1601> Most have never heard of Dimitri Dudaman, a Romanian pastor who suffered tremendously under communism.  God brought him to America to warn the American people in 1980s.  Most large churches are led by Masons and members of SS.  They buried his warning.      https://t.co/fG8FvKPsZd
1323235490078871552 2020-11-02 20:08:20 +0800 <Josef1601> Some of you like the Prophesy Club.  Here is their take.👇  https://t.co/Folwtno8FL  Not gonna post things from other religions like Louis Farrakhan who has been saying this for decades (children of the world wiser than children of the light).
1323233081071984642 2020-11-02 19:58:45 +0800 <Josef1601> *disputes*.   Arrrrg!   Typos!     Ok sorry about that!   Here is a 2 part sermon from Independent Baptist Pastor Adams.   https://t.co/g9zaYfvfkp  Must understand that America’s purpose was known to men of God also.  They USED to preach about it before modern heresy took over.
1323231651892256769 2020-11-02 19:53:04 +0800 <Josef1601> Getting some requests and dilutes on why America is or is not the Daughter of Babylon.   Posted numerous things on issue but here is a comprehensive 2 hour Bible study on it.   America was founded for the purpose of bringing in the NWO.  Study!  https://t.co/4XKq8UmGxe
1323226698486304768 2020-11-02 19:33:23 +0800 <Josef1601> @Ai_intolerant @BeauxAn Great source!  Tavares has been sounding the alarm for decades.   She’s a walking encyclopedia of documented facts.
1323142531568336896 2020-11-02 13:58:56 +0800 <Josef1601> @timesoftrouble Well said!🔥
1323142356649070598 2020-11-02 13:58:15 +0800 <Josef1601> @mandy_sesco He’s the Man of Sin, the one long awaited to bring the Reset (NWO).   Many will worship him.   But he brings chaos, poverty, death and destruction.
1323128370566234112 2020-11-02 13:02:40 +0800 <Josef1601> @richseng Blasphemous for you to compare the two.   Check yourself.
1323092766914682882 2020-11-02 10:41:12 +0800 <Josef1601> The man of sin revealing who he truly is and what he has and will do to America.
1323038824432345089 2020-11-02 07:06:51 +0800 <Josef1601> @FinalRegulator Film is specific at to America The Babylon and its role in brining in the NWO.   Watch it then we can talk.
1323037477851025408 2020-11-02 07:01:30 +0800 <Josef1601> Still a strong recommendation.   They make a ton of $$ from conservative Evangelicals so they lead you up to the point but chicken out and don't mention Messiah Trump.
1323036673077366786 2020-11-02 06:58:18 +0800 <Josef1601> @geewhzz Sad but true.🤦‍♂️
1323036418248232961 2020-11-02 06:57:17 +0800 <Josef1601> Just watched the film.   Excellent information on the New Atlantis (America) and its role in bringing in the NWO.    It mentions Clinton, Bush, Obama, Hillary and even Podesta.     But guess who is not mentioned?   Yeap!  Osiris Trump,  King of Fake Israel and the world!
1323007595280519170 2020-11-02 05:02:45 +0800 <Josef1601> Never fails to amaze me how many people vote despite knowing the game is rigged.    No wonder the powerful despise them.
1322905029804728322 2020-11-01 22:15:12 +0800 <Josef1601> @Jeannie127 @YouTube They did a fantastic job.   Secrets we never knew are being revealed.     Babylon is truly being exposed.
1322892847658553344 2020-11-01 21:26:47 +0800 <Josef1601> When you’re no longer useful.

1322735201773080577 2020-11-01 11:00:21 +0800 <Josef1601> @Michael38488947 We’ve been lied to so much we longer know truth from falsehood.    That’s why we can’t “vouch” for anyone we don’t know intimately.
1322731379680051201 2020-11-01 10:45:10 +0800 <Josef1601> @theflowernurse If they do not support our wars.....  Wow

1322719352848863232 2020-11-01 09:57:23 +0800 <Josef1601> England just became prison island.     We will soon join them.
1322650566254878720 2020-11-01 05:24:03 +0800 <Josef1601> @Jeannie127 That surname from Kansas?
1322649861880270849 2020-11-01 05:21:15 +0800 <Josef1601> @spriter99880 Let’s see how many Jihadist Erdogan can send from Idlib now.   Take them out in Idlib and end TR’s adventures everywhere.
1322648675722633222 2020-11-01 05:16:32 +0800 <Josef1601> @erinschmitt66 99% are 501(c)(3).     Hostages to Babylon.
1322648440590028801 2020-11-01 05:15:36 +0800 <Josef1601> @YahsTroll4Truth That’s a beautiful thing!
1322646684472627203 2020-11-01 05:08:37 +0800 <Josef1601> Just heard the World Series ended......  Without going to google...  a.   Do you know who played? b.   Know who won?  I didn’t know....there’s 50 people in the stands and I wasn’t one of them.     The end of sports came during the reign of the Beast, Trump, King of Fake Israel.
1322645360297336832 2020-11-01 05:03:22 +0800 <Josef1601> *they’re”.   Sick of autocorrect!
1322633387421687809 2020-11-01 04:15:47 +0800 <Josef1601> Costumes give an inside look at reverse demon possession.      It’s not demons possessing humans, it’s humans acting like (this possessing) demons.
1322631718839484418 2020-11-01 04:09:09 +0800 <Josef1601> Greenwald was there to bury the Snowden documents and the Assange saga.    Read what he writes but know the agenda.     They’re all CIA/Pentagon/etc.     All of them.
1322630757660168193 2020-11-01 04:05:20 +0800 <Josef1601> @YahsTroll4Truth 😂.  Love your perspective!🔥👊✊.  Maybe more right than many of the educated fools know.
1322600177216163840 2020-11-01 02:03:49 +0800 <Josef1601> @Obamasshadow 🤣😂  Pleading to Antichrist Trump to oppose the antichrist canal and antichrist system.
1322535373386506240 2020-10-31 21:46:19 +0800 <Josef1601> Good article detailing the cooperation between US and British special forces and terrorists in Syria.   The purpose is to cause chaos to justify the continued occupation of the oil fields.   Twitter is actively censoring news about our bad actions around the world.  Find it👇  https://t.co/mh1g8Qsy7s
1322534267252019209 2020-10-31 21:41:55 +0800 <Josef1601> @Mattskilletguy @stevendenoon Something like that.  Foolish to follow any of them.
1322524105535590401 2020-10-31 21:01:32 +0800 <Josef1601> Hezbollah is hated because it’s an effective force against the terrorists groups recruited, trained and financed by NATO/Israel/Turkey.    To our eternal shame, we’re the terrorists.
1322434059402883072 2020-10-31 15:03:44 +0800 <Josef1601> Just when you thought 2020 brought enough conflict.
1322432266166063105 2020-10-31 14:56:36 +0800 <Josef1601> @theflowernurse Yes it does!!!

1322416813028839425 2020-10-31 13:55:12 +0800 <Josef1601> 100% correct.
1322416011124056064 2020-10-31 13:52:01 +0800 <Josef1601> An articulate creep.
1322414995502751745 2020-10-31 13:47:58 +0800 <Josef1601> I thought it was Evangelicals believing Trump will save the US.
1322412885004427264 2020-10-31 13:39:35 +0800 <Josef1601> Greenwald was just fine with the Intercept’s decision to bury the Snowden papers.  But he now becomes offended because a child of one the elites is corrupt?  They have dirt on the ENTIRE political class.  They keep the secrets.   So read but don’t buy the drama.
1322409789050204162 2020-10-31 13:27:17 +0800 <Josef1601> Poor wording.    The news the Empire’s MSM do not want us to hear!  Or the news the Zionist puppeteers don’t want us to know.   There....fixed.
1322408731393609728 2020-10-31 13:23:05 +0800 <Josef1601> @theflowernurse They took it down already.   Any other links?
1322338650659655685 2020-10-31 08:44:36 +0800 <Josef1601> October 31, 1517  The day Luther sent his theses to Albert.  The day the Reformation was born.    The Jesuit army mocks Protestantism knowing many believers were sacrificed for revenge on the anniversary of that date.    Know your history.  Be set free from this wicked age.
1322327625558347776 2020-10-31 08:00:48 +0800 <Josef1601> Killing innocents and beheading Christians will come to an end.    God can send an earthquake or a flood or something like it.    Many nations deserve it including US/UK/Israel/France/NATO/Saudi Arabia and feel free to add to the list.
1322324847909867522 2020-10-31 07:49:46 +0800 <Josef1601> And now....the news we don’t get to hear.
1322322591416258560 2020-10-31 07:40:48 +0800 <Josef1601> @wisermann Trump will say this in a rally and the crowd will cheer.
1322312874300231685 2020-10-31 07:02:11 +0800 <Josef1601> @Lulu72181560 Crazy indeed.

1322263886528192513 2020-10-31 03:47:31 +0800 <Josef1601> The pastor thought Trump was 'evil.' So he quit his conservative church  It costs to stand against the Beast.    https://t.co/CuFyj5I5zJ
1322185755205242880 2020-10-30 22:37:03 +0800 <Josef1601> Wondered if anyone would mention this:  They can’t pull that hoax now.  We got a ton of people capable of seeing, filming it.   Government couldn’t control narrative today.
1322184883846946816 2020-10-30 22:33:35 +0800 <Josef1601> @pufpufpafpaf Yes.   Biggest bunch of nonsense ever!🤣🔥.

This is one of the only times in history where we will not be able to travel, work, buy or sell without governmental approval.  Sounds like a mark to me.    “Worship” in the Greek also means honor, revere, obey.    What else we need?
1321635559832473600 2020-10-29 10:10:46 +0800 <Josef1601> @Jabbok13 @YouTube I’ve spoken against dispensationalism 100 times.   There are many schools of thought.   Preterism is just as wrong as dispensationalism.
1321628131569078273 2020-10-29 09:41:15 +0800 <Josef1601> Criticizing Trump the King of Israel is now antisemetic.

And I wasn’t raised that way.    My momma whooped the stupid out of me.  Many today need to have the stupid whopped right out of them.   But it’s all good. 🙏

1321226394941198337 2020-10-28 07:04:54 +0800 <Josef1601> @Berns12060 My tone?     Ok.  Would you pretty please do what’s right and follow the Bible?  Please?  It ain’t my tone.  Most people go to a church with an emasculated minister.   Tell them to put sugar on things. Judgment is here bro.  You know how many around you are going to die?
1321225243617316866 2020-10-28 07:00:19 +0800 <Josef1601> @JeffSco94248741 No. As a believer I would say that anyone stealing your home and land is a thief.  You ok with stealing?
1321224930621640705 2020-10-28 06:59:05 +0800 <Josef1601> @JeffSco94248741 Ok boss. Pick up a history book and we can talk.  Jerusalem was destroyed (by righteous judgment in 70 ad) the land after the destruction of Jerusalem was called Palestine.  Thanks a Yam ways.
1321188992084303873 2020-10-28 04:36:16 +0800 <Josef1601> Don’t follow me or anyone else.    Open your Bibles and follow Christ.

1321177324541431808 2020-10-28 03:49:55 +0800 <Josef1601> Question:  Is oppression, land theft, injustice and violence acceptable to God?  Then why do think Rothschild’s Israel is above the basics?    I’ve been to Israel.  I love all people but I am Palestinian.     We’re all Palestinian.  Or we blind!

1321171958998990851 2020-10-28 03:28:35 +0800 <Josef1601> Did you know?  The best thing you can do for a wayward Christian is to...  tell them to repent.    Tell them to repent.  They’re a heathen. Repent.   That’s true love.  To confront your friend towards salvation.    That’s real love.

1320923980946092033 2020-10-27 11:03:13 +0800 <Josef1601> Jesús said:  “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.” Mark 16:16 KJV  What says you all lying apostates, did Jesus misspeak or is baptism necessary for salvation?
1320916441311387649 2020-10-27 10:33:15 +0800 <Josef1601> @FinalRegulator Well, Mother Theresa ain’t the Bible.  The Bible is the Bible.  Just follow the Bible.  It’s so simple.

1320895055071236096 2020-10-27 09:08:16 +0800 <Josef1601> @rothanwalker No.  They’re either lying or lazy and fail to study.   They’ll have to account for their malfeasance.

1320877303174516738 2020-10-27 07:57:44 +0800 <Josef1601> ANY “minister” who says voting Trump is voting “pro-life” is a just another lying devil.

We’ve struggled with things as well.  Broken homes, addictions, abuse.....we’ve been there.    Love you brother.   You are my brother.
1320875601759264768 2020-10-27 07:50:58 +0800 <Josef1601> “It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.” Hebrews 10:31 KJV  A curse be upon you ministers.   For coddling sin.  For telling your people that voting for Trump is better than...  Curse you false prophets of Babylon.    You ain’t no brother of mine.
1320874606631112704 2020-10-27 07:47:01 +0800 <Josef1601> The pro-life savior is not saving too much at all.   All you Christian ministers who tweet nonsense and “follow” me or whatever, you a hypocrite.    Lying SOB.  Step down that pulpit lest and escape the judgment to come.

1320835476891328515 2020-10-27 05:11:32 +0800 <Josef1601> Psych-op.  Action:  Everyone the people hate announces they’re voting for Biden.   Reaction:  Most will enthusiastically vote for Trump.     Child’s play.
1320510334269116416 2020-10-26 07:39:32 +0800 <Josef1601> @FrymanMyloe ALL over Florida as well.
1320507778985873411 2020-10-26 07:29:23 +0800 <Josef1601> @FinalRegulator @YorubaOfYahudah I copied and pasted the verse.   1 Peter, Jude and Revelations say the same thing.

1320410740126265344 2020-10-26 01:03:47 +0800 <Josef1601> @samkia22 If you think Trump or Biden will bring salvation, we’re not on the same page at all as that’s a totally different gospel.
1320410277570031619 2020-10-26 01:01:56 +0800 <Josef1601> @CharlesMorriz Nah.   People vote for the beast system because they refuse to heed Christ’s words to come out of her.   People defend these wicked Luciferians because they have replaced God with man.     But peace be unto you.  We don’t have to think alike.
1320366896399732736 2020-10-25 22:09:33 +0800 <Josef1601> @CharlesMorriz I'm not here to help.   I'm here to tell the truth as I've studied, researched and discerned.   BOTH of these candidates have allegations of sexual improprieties.  It ain't my fault most choose to cover things under the rug.
1320366310015094785 2020-10-25 22:07:14 +0800 <Josef1601> @Ojutuongar Amen.   I've posted the same thread and went down every single conversion in the NT.  All who believed were baptized.   Period.
1320311539610619905 2020-10-25 18:29:35 +0800 <Josef1601> Amen!   This what the Bible says.   Not men....the Bible.

We are saying that it is time for Christians to come out of Babylon and stop voting for the lesser of two evils.   God ain’t into choosing lesser evils.   That’s what we’re saying.  What say you?

1320188030683054081 2020-10-25 10:18:49 +0800 <Josef1601> @blondenfun1 Yes.  We all know it’s a scam.  ALL governments act in unison because the script has been written.  Many spend their time looking for answers while they’re getting our jails ready.    It’s too late. People are way too docile.
1320186184467886080 2020-10-25 10:11:28 +0800 <Josef1601> Any Christian voting for Trump because “Trump is pro-life” is a darn liar.    They vote for Trump because they vote for Trump.  Morality has nothing to do with it as they KNOW Trump is pro-abortion!  Go to church tomorrow, hear some pastors lie and tell you Trump is pro-life.
1320181085108637697 2020-10-25 09:51:13 +0800 <Josef1601> Trump worshippers still get all upset when we call out that lawless scoundrel for the antichrist he truly is.   And Biden supporters?  Well, first, I met but a handful, and all know Zombie Pedo Joe ain’t winning.   Trump will win. He’s the Beast, chosen to bring destruction.
1320179901085995015 2020-10-25 09:46:30 +0800 <Josef1601> @Geno_JTM No.   I got it right.     Trump declared a national emergency on March 13, 2020.   That has a legal effect throughout the nation.   Study that first, then holler at me.
1320179619883061248 2020-10-25 09:45:23 +0800 <Josef1601> @FinalRegulator Yeap.  That’s one of these false prophets.   Guy has so many dreams I wonder if he’s ever awake.
1320177820648210432 2020-10-25 09:38:14 +0800 <Josef1601> Freemasons use “dreams” or “visions” or “words” to let out clues about what’s to come.   Then they wrap their speech with “church” and claim to be prophets.    Bunch of fools then follow them on YY, Twitter, church, etc.   That’s how they prop all that’s evil.
1320176680586104833 2020-10-25 09:33:43 +0800 <Josef1601> YouTube keeps deleting channels that mention:   Zionist NWO  Netanyahu is a demon  WHO Vax = 666  Trump is the Beast  Biden Hunter = creep  Joe Biden = zombie  Israel wants WWIII  Trump shoes👇  Can’t have opinions now.    Trump’s administration killed free speech.  https://t.co/D9DT4PME2y

1319992979273252865 2020-10-24 21:23:45 +0800 <Josef1601> @BashurshLife The world thinks America is a Christian nation.  It stopped being so decades ago.   It replaced God with men and celebrities.   So, most follow men as they think they can change the world through politics.  They’re 💯% blind.

Stop looking for men as most have been corrupted.   Especially these false political prophets like Clement, Taylor and such—more wrong than not.   The Word is ALWAYS right.

Want to know what He says or thinks?   Open the Bible.   Want a “word”?  Open the Bible.   Careful...  Someone says “thus sayeth the Lord” better be quoting Scripture.

1317526668878237696 2020-10-18 02:03:30 +0800 <Josef1601> @GospelGal1Cor15 All of that was done by the apostles.  Scripture does not contradict itself.    Baptism is not a work of the flesh.  Discipleship is not a work of the flesh.  Bearing fruit is not a work of the flesh.   It’s all by and through grace.   No contradiction.
1317519940690345989 2020-10-18 01:36:46 +0800 <Josef1601> @GospelGal1Cor15 I don’t follow.  Salvation has always been by faith, that’s what Hebrews 11 is all about.    But, even though it was ALWAYS by faith, faith was evident by obedience and fruits.   Nothing different.
1317515706452279299 2020-10-18 01:19:57 +0800 <Josef1601> The Mark of the Beast will not come with a warning label.   That alone will doom many.

1317513586994970625 2020-10-18 01:11:32 +0800 <Josef1601> @Kdawg0_0 Amen!   My girls were baptized at 12 and 13.  Great and awesome deal.  Congratulations dad!👊✊🔥🎉🎊
1317513353594621952 2020-10-18 01:10:36 +0800 <Josef1601> @KLouie70 No.  Because your position skirts around the fact that in the book of Acts, they were not considered believers until they were baptized. That’s just a fact.   Scripture does not contradict itself.  Biblically there’s no such thing as an unbaptized believe.
1317512543703830529 2020-10-18 01:07:23 +0800 <Josef1601> What happens in baptism?  “Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.” Romans 6:4 KJV  We’re just buried and rise with Christ.  That’s all.
1317509891444101121 2020-10-18 00:56:50 +0800 <Josef1601> @KLouie70 We’re good.  The doctrine you’re speaking about arose from the 1800s from the Baptist, Anabaptist, Reformation debate.    I agree with the early fathers and just do what the Bible says to do.    “Where the Bible speaks, we speak. Where the Bible is silent, we are silent.”
1317509272419393541 2020-10-18 00:54:23 +0800 <Josef1601> @Kdawg0_0 I’ll take that!
1317509050263867392 2020-10-18 00:53:30 +0800 <Josef1601> @Jesusis53688620 Yeap!  It has all the elements:  mandatory, used to travel, work, buy or sell but because it doesn’t have a warning label saying:  “this is the mark and taking it damns you”, they can’t see it.   Religious leaders missed Jesus despite the signs.  They’ve always been BLIND!  https://t.co/OWqqhdnMpo
1317508105387806722 2020-10-18 00:49:45 +0800 <Josef1601> @Kdawg0_0 Romans 13 is the same idea.   We follow God and obey earthly leaders. We give to man what is due as citizens-honor, respect, taxes, etc.    BUT in heavenly things, we follow God.  Just like Daniel defied the king and John the Baptist called out Herod, we follow God over all men.
1317507304665776135 2020-10-18 00:46:34 +0800 <Josef1601> @KLouie70 Jesus last sermon was Mark 16:16.    “He that believes and is baptized shall be saved...”  As an attorney, we look for elements.  Jesus is the las, he gave the elements.  Let people do as they may, I’ll do the elements.
1317506417960562689 2020-10-18 00:43:02 +0800 <Josef1601> Yeap!   Ministers that you thought were right are pushing submission to leaders by misapplying Hebrews 13:17.   Hebrews 13:17, goes with 13:7.  We are to submit to faithful church leaders and not some Luciferian government official or a Freemason minister.
1317505752584671232 2020-10-18 00:40:24 +0800 <Josef1601> @KLouie70 *would not*
1317505210638569472 2020-10-18 00:38:14 +0800 <Josef1601> @KLouie70 Well, I used to believe your way but I’ve become a bit more hesitant since the Scriptures don’t say otherwise and we know the sinner’s prayer is 💯% heretical.    So, for me, I wouldn’t risk it and would advise anyone else to disregard scripture.
1317504760648519681 2020-10-18 00:36:27 +0800 <Josef1601> @GospelGal1Cor15 JESUS said:  “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.” Mark 16:16 KJV  Belief, baptism, discipleship and faithfulness.  All by grace.
1317504263548010498 2020-10-18 00:34:29 +0800 <Josef1601> @KLouie70 We don’t argue by exception as Jesus did as He had the power to do.    We do know that EVERY believer in the book of Acts was baptized.    So, unless we’re the thief on the cross, we should do what JESUS told us to do in Mark 16:16.
1317503794633199620 2020-10-18 00:32:37 +0800 <Josef1601> Churches today diminish element of baptism.     Why?   Cause a prayer is easier than an action.   It’s fast food Christianity/-salvation to go with no study or effort.   Very different than the real deal.
1317503339718971393 2020-10-18 00:30:48 +0800 <Josef1601> “What shall we do to be saved?   Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.” Acts 2:37-38 KJV  Heretical sinner’s prayer eliminated baptism.
1317502328845537282 2020-10-18 00:26:47 +0800 <Josef1601> @GospelGal1Cor15 Prior to Christ, it was the same:  Faith  Repentance  Discipleship  Hebrews 9, 10 and 11.   These chapters are key in understanding that there has been no change in the plan of God and gift of salvation.

The warmongering supporters of the apartheid state paid for the conference.  So, those that support those who HATE Christ and his people are holding the event.  Oh ok!  Lack of a backbone leading many to hell.
1317457097068511234 2020-10-17 21:27:03 +0800 <Josef1601> @theflowernurse All who came to Christ in the New Testament history of the early church (ACTS) were immediately baptized.  To this day, Satanists and Luciferians KNOW that the seal of God is placed on baptism.  Once you're baptized, you're sealed with the Spirit.     KNOW WHAT'S REAL.
1317456562022121472 2020-10-17 21:24:56 +0800 <Josef1601> @theflowernurse Further, their prayers are filled with Luciferian language "turn from dark to light", "walk in the light", "seek the light", etc.    BUT the main point, is that he encourages all to say the "sinners prayer" without mentioning baptism and discipleship.   They took baptism out.
1317455794871455757 2020-10-17 21:21:53 +0800 <Josef1601> @theflowernurse In their purpose statement, they mention the "Messiah" but not ONE time do they mention the name of Jesus.  No Jesus, no Yehoshua, nothing....just Messiah.   Getting them ready for one who comes in his own name.    Jonathan Cahn and all those leaders of the Return are anathema.
1317454467038650368 2020-10-17 21:16:36 +0800 <Josef1601> @theflowernurse Anything with Jonathan Cahn is anathema.   Notice how he rises the "Vulcan" sign as he is "praying" in Hebrew.   Of course, the sheep don't know that he is invoking a Kabbalic curse upon them all.    Amazing.  Mainline Christianity led and thus cursed by Luciferians.

That’s how Americans feel and that’s what we know.    Don’t get confused.  Our government is one thing. The people is another.  We know.  AQ is an Israeli project.   That’s why it’s leaders are all Mossad.

Or are you a Zionist or Ankara paid troll who wants to bring chaos and more bloodshed?  I’ve seen your profile.    Got u.    I don’t comment on your posts, don’t comment on mine.

1316412227403087872 2020-10-15 00:15:07 +0800 <Josef1601> @sddowdy Basic stuff but super important.   They’ve corrupted the basics to fit their agenda.
1316411667882872834 2020-10-15 00:12:54 +0800 <Josef1601> What makes a grown man act like this?  There’s no one near his vehicle, no threat to his person but he feels compelled to confront people expressing a point of view he doesn’t like.   This is the spirit of the age.   The love of many gone cold.   AntiChrist army is ready.
1316406697229987840 2020-10-14 23:53:08 +0800 <Josef1601> @oli4 @Borstich “Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,” Romans 1:22 KJV  It’s the great apostasy (falling away).  It’s the antichrist spirit of the age. 🤷🏻‍♂️  Bible prophecy being fulfilled right here, right now.

Remember Heb. 13:7 when they pound Heb. 13:17. 👇  They’ve used this verse out of context for CENTURIES!  Millions deceived.    Truth = freedom.  https://t.co/8AozcIYunQ
1316379464096518150 2020-10-14 22:04:56 +0800 <Josef1601> @Borstich @oli4 Denying the obvious is foolishness.     Most people know there’s a God.  Many refuse Him because acceptance of His existence requires acknowledgement of a higher power and accountability.    It’s not a belief thing, it’s a pride thing and rebellion thing.  “Nobody gonna tell me.”
1316378742323908608 2020-10-14 22:02:03 +0800 <Josef1601> @Borstich @oli4 God is self evident.   There’s love, beauty and order in nature.

1316376588682960898 2020-10-14 21:53:30 +0800 <Josef1601> The selfish inhumanity of the Covid task force and gang.   Social distancing, masks, protect me, me, me and then me.

1316344662345609216 2020-10-14 19:46:38 +0800 <Josef1601> Being with the devil costs more than they realize.   Supporting the devil costs more than they realize.   That’s what all these Christians who supported change through politics are about to find out.   Trump and Biden are on the same team.  Their goal is 💯% control over is.
1316343238723358720 2020-10-14 19:40:59 +0800 <Josef1601> @BrngnItAllTgthr I don’t know what you mean by fruition.   We know he’s paid over $30 million in past 2 decades to settle sexual abuse claims, many of them with minors.

1315742761535053834 2020-10-13 03:54:54 +0800 <Josef1601> @FinalRegulator Amen to that.    Plus, we got a bunch of weaklings that would rather escape (rapture) before they suffer anything.    Lord help if they break a nail for the gospel.    Bunch of yellow bellies Christians who don’t stand for anything and do anything except barbecue.
1315740644867018754 2020-10-13 03:46:29 +0800 <Josef1601> For the Christian, there is no greater honor than to suffer for Christ.    “And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.” Acts 5:41 KJV  Rapture people will not know the joy of suffering for Christ.  🤷🏻‍♂️

Check out his YT channel.  I learned a lot myself.
1315689544117821441 2020-10-13 00:23:26 +0800 <Josef1601> Two things we don’t see in Central Florida:  1. Birds 2. Biden/Harris lawn signs.    Yeap.  The Beast will remain in power.    The birds were our sign to flee Babylon before it’s too late.    Trump is the Beast, The Man of Sin, AC, King of the Daughter of Babylon.

The crying and wailing will be so loud that’s all we would hear!  It would then be used as a pretext for occupation, sanctions and war.    Apartheid state is out of control.

1315634571959046144 2020-10-12 20:44:59 +0800 <Josef1601> @Pinam27Maria Super important.  For a Christian, a good interlinear Bible with Hebrew &amp; Greek, Strong’s Concordance and Matthew Henry’s commentary.    ALL commentaries and most modern translations have been corrupted by Jesuit owned/controlled publishing companies.

1315624799583047681 2020-10-12 20:06:10 +0800 <Josef1601> @3rd_abraham @Tweetie08665082 Babylon USA:  “...for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols.” Jeremiah 50:38 KJV  They are crazy about their graven images.  Watch the Evangelical brigade rise to the defense of idols.
1315621195555975168 2020-10-12 19:51:50 +0800 <Josef1601> @Qudsn_en Admitting that ancient Egyptians, and this ancient Hebrews, were Black.  They surely don’t look like the white Israelis in the apartheid state.
1315618532051365888 2020-10-12 19:41:15 +0800 <Josef1601> @hbomb197977 I like Matthew Henry’s commentary in the issue.  https://t.co/OGAeqYxM5C  At the time, the pagan Roman Empire was firmly in place.  With Constantine, church and state merged to form the office of the Papal antichrist.  No doubt the Pope is antichrist to this day.
1315616120649457665 2020-10-12 19:31:40 +0800 <Josef1601> Stop saying that Trump was not involved in the sexual abuse of minors!

1315601511012065280 2020-10-12 18:33:37 +0800 <Josef1601> @hbomb197977 There have been antichrists since the early church.  Nero being the first one who killed tens of thousands of Christians.   Popish Rome is responsible for the death of millions of Christians who did not submit to the authority of Rome.    So, we’ve been slaughtered since day one.

1315382112908972033 2020-10-12 04:01:48 +0800 <Josef1601> Rapture folks:  What you gonna do in 5 years when you’re still here and our liberties are gone?  When you can’t go to church?  When you’re a chemical zombie?  In 10 years, when you’re a robot slave?  Wished you resisted now instead of waiting to vanish and leave problems behind.
1315378296373366786 2020-10-12 03:46:39 +0800 <Josef1601> And...  “Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.” Galatians 5:1 KJV  STAY FREE!
1315377842901995527 2020-10-12 03:44:50 +0800 <Josef1601> Jerusalem in Israel = bondage.   Jerusalem above = freedom.  “For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.” Gal.  4:25-26 KJV  BE FREE!

1315293413328252928 2020-10-11 22:09:21 +0800 <Josef1601> @SolaScriptura99 That’s one act.  Not two.  That’s simultaneous.  There’s no delay between one and the other.  That’s the second coming.  No secret rapture there.
1315293095970451457 2020-10-11 22:08:05 +0800 <Josef1601> @SolaScriptura99 The quotes are OUT OF CONTEXT and the BIBLE says Jesus will come back ONE time.    There’s no mention of a secret rapture.  There’s no such thing.    Show us BIBLICALLY the secret rapture versus the passages of Jesus coming back ONE time.
1315284538034204672 2020-10-11 21:34:05 +0800 <Josef1601> @SolaScriptura99 Jesus is coming back ONE time.  That’s the biblical model.  That’s what the early church believed.  That’s what’s written.   ONE time.  There will be no mulligans.
1315284148802801664 2020-10-11 21:32:32 +0800 <Josef1601> @SolaScriptura99 We’ve been suffering judgment for 2,000 years.   God has judged nations all throughout history and didn’t “rapture” believers out of them.   Many massacres, natural disasters, and acts of wrath have occurred.   Millions of Christians have died.  We are not better than them.
1315283435381026816 2020-10-11 21:29:42 +0800 <Josef1601> @SolaScriptura99 One thing you haven’t done is study the occultic history if the rapture doctrine.   Tell me again how God revealed his truth to a 13 year old girl from a spiritualist background.     Heresies today are prevalent.  People hearing what their itching ears want to hear.
1315282745841651712 2020-10-11 21:26:58 +0800 <Josef1601> @SolaScriptura99 Millions of Christians have suffered throughout the ages but rich, lukewarm American Christians think they will not suffer because they are special and they will escape prosecution.
1315282141316624384 2020-10-11 21:24:33 +0800 <Josef1601> @SolaScriptura99 I’ve done a ton of research.  Don’t confuse modern rapture with the angles separating the what from the tares.    Further, the rapture is wholly inconsistent with Christ’s words that we, like him, will suffer unto death and inconsistent with the history of the church.

1315272318369902592 2020-10-11 20:45:31 +0800 <Josef1601> Apologetics 101  God is the only way to escape the grim eternity our satanic leaders have planned for us.     You can’t be “woke” by just knowing what they’re doing.  That’s called being a spectator.     You’re only “woke” by taking actions to oppose and escape their evil plans.

God is the informed choice for those that are truly woke.  He is the only way to escape what Satan and his servants (fallen angles, Illuminati, aliens, demons, etc) have worked to create.  All their efforts is for your soul.   You have that

An invitation to what?  To depart from the path of suffering our Satanic leaders have created and have peace and life.  A path to overcome this filthy world.    He came that we might have

I’ve found that much of the objections to belief in God are based on wrong beliefs as to what that entails.    Because God is truth and life, there can be none without Him.   Men might perverted it

Nevertheless, we admit that evil in its pure form exist, then we must also admit that good in its pure form also exists.

Only one with a written history of acts demonstrating his power and only one providing man with a form of life to lead to salvation.    The God of the Bible.

Now, assume that you are right and there are many “gods” which one is superior?   Which one shall we follow?     See, now that the premise is that there could be many, then it begs the question: which is right?

1315087127986790401 2020-10-11 08:29:39 +0800 <Josef1601> @KellyHanna1 Unfortunately, the evidence supports this conclusion.  When Jesus said narrow and difficult is the way, he wasn’t joking.
1315086596241321984 2020-10-11 08:27:32 +0800 <Josef1601> Contend for the faith once delivered to the saints.  Jude 1:3.    “But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.” Galatians 1:8 KJV  Don’t follow false prophets.  They are accursed.

1315081454532071424 2020-10-11 08:07:06 +0800 <Josef1601> @KellyHanna1 Badly worded:    "will be considered legally dead upon the realization of certain conditions."  Better
1315081088436494337 2020-10-11 08:05:39 +0800 <Josef1601> @Jeannie127 @RoystonPotter He did a nice little video on an interview where Trump basically said the same thing!  So, all his defenders have a mouth full of pie as the man proclaimed basically the same thing.  Been saying it for a long time (and it has cost me) that Trump is the Beast.
1315080407004729345 2020-10-11 08:02:56 +0800 <Josef1601> @RoystonPotter @JonahofNinevah @0ctoberReignz Perfect!  Trump says the same thing 2-3 times.  So, while there might a dispute as to the Tweet, he basically said the same thing in an interview when spoke about donating his plasma!  The man does believe his blood has healing power.
1315079598913327109 2020-10-11 07:59:44 +0800 <Josef1601> @KellyHanna1 Legally speaking, every insurance policy has stipulations in which a disappeared person will be considered legally dead.  IF the raptured occurred, the correct position is that the person is alive and no benefits will be due.    Old ministers held the rapture to be a deception.
1315078803165716485 2020-10-11 07:56:34 +0800 <Josef1601> @KellyHanna1 The Rapture doctrine is a Jesuit (not a Biblical) concept.  👇 The rapture was never part of the church until the late 19th century much thanks to occultist John Nelson Darby and his "progeny" C.I. Scofield.   https://t.co/qP9U1lLhSv

All believers in the NT were baptized.    As to “outward expression of inner grace” is a nice explanation as what happens in the act itself.

Read Romans 6:3-4 and related verses on baptism.   No such thing as an unbaptized believer.    As to your father, those things are left to God.  Who are we to Q?
1314599868116197376 2020-10-10 00:13:27 +0800 <Josef1601> @Texas11970367 Here’s a brief summary of baptism in the early church.   We must remember that it was Freemason and Catholic apostate Billy Graham who popularized the unbiblical “praying Jesus into your heart”.    Ever since the early church, believers were baptized by immersion.
1314586901819666437 2020-10-09 23:21:55 +0800 <Josef1601> @TechiyahY This is what Jesus said:  “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.” Mark 16:16 KJV  Belief and baptism go hand in hand.  That’s the command.    EVERY believer was baptized.    Your statement disregards Christ and the NT.

1312808898106134531 2020-10-05 01:36:46 +0800 <Josef1601> This is a must study that 501(c)(3) Freemason/Jesuit led churches (that’s 💯% of the big ones) NEVER EVER teach.     The US is the HINDERMOST of nations identified by Jeremiah the prophet.   We are the only nation that fits.    👇
1312805896913854471 2020-10-05 01:24:51 +0800 <Josef1601> Jeremiah called the American Empire as the “hindermost” of nations.   Modern bible versions changed this word for a reason.    Hindermost opens the door for us to discern who the prophet is referring to.     The Beast comes from the HINDERMOST of nations.

1312796829935906816 2020-10-05 00:48:49 +0800 <Josef1601> Tellingly, Trump here called Covid the “plague”.   Covid, the deadly plague, which the Beast survived.     Now, with miracle cures, medications, vaccines (signs and wonders) he will deceive the world into accepting his mark (vax).    None will travel, work, buy or sell w/out it.
1312773741689155586 2020-10-04 23:17:04 +0800 <Josef1601> @JonahofNinevah They’re so foul mouthed.   It does show the intellectual laziness to resort to insults without attempting to articulate a position.    Like the “Christian” Trumpist who cursed me out while quoting scripture. 🤦🏻   The ironic blasphemy didn’t even faze him.
1312594142346850305 2020-10-04 11:23:25 +0800 <Josef1601> Post debate poll numbers made POTUS sick.     After 14 days, we will see a kind, composed clone of a man for the 2nd debate.    Watch poll numbers rise enough.   But better yet, watch people clamor for masks and vaccines.   It’s pure Hegel and now his mark is near.

1312400513992986625 2020-10-03 22:34:00 +0800 <Josef1601> Question:  Can you vote and support the antichrist and be saved?
1312396194853924866 2020-10-03 22:16:50 +0800 <Josef1601> Voting for Trump?  Then you’re voting for the antichrist.     Voting for Biden?  Then you’re part of the Beast system.   Safer not to vote than to repent for voting.
1312363557594509313 2020-10-03 20:07:09 +0800 <Josef1601> @LarStoltz @JonahofNinevah Oh no.   Many ministers, scholars, and researchers point to Trump as the final Beast, the man of sin.   I’ve posted tons of tweets on subject.   Got more flack and lost more followers than many know but I am convinced this is so.

It's coming.  The day is near when they will use our posts to come after us.   It's fine with me.   It's an honor to finally join the saints who suffered for Christ.   We've had it easy while OUR government waged war against Christians all over the world.  It's time.

1311303552577437696 2020-09-30 21:55:04 +0800 <Josef1601> @America71005572 I agree that's the choice purposefully given to the people.  For the first time ever, I refuse it.  I'm exercising my right to dissent by no partaking in this wicked system that forces me to choose evil in degrees.  I'm coming out of her Lord!  I'm finally coming out!
1311271551279431680 2020-09-30 19:47:54 +0800 <Josef1601> The American people lost.    That’s the debate summary no one speaks about.
1311268717217673216 2020-09-30 19:36:39 +0800 <Josef1601> She’s 💯% correct.     America the Babylon is falling for her sins have reached to heaven and her judgment has been pronounced.     “Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a man.” Isaiah 47:3
1311125240546816002 2020-09-30 10:06:31 +0800 <Josef1601> This debate is a national embarrassment.  But do you know why?  It's judgment time for modern Babylon.   For her, truly the worst is yet to come.  People will see you naked; they will see you humbled and shamed. I will take vengeance, and no one will stop me.” Isaiah 47:3

There’s also cross references and historical documents from the Intertestamental period and the early church fathers staying the same.    Line upon line.    Plus, you first stated that the name has to do with a goddess, which it does not.
1311096995805835264 2020-09-30 08:14:17 +0800 <Josef1601> Saying Jesus defeated Lucifer seems to annoy some people.    Ok.  Jesus defeated Lucifer.   The main battle was won, all we have is a few clean up scrimmages left.

1311087785504374786 2020-09-30 07:37:41 +0800 <Josef1601> @NorthernSerb The West continues to prod and accost Russia and insult Putin.  It doesn’t know that Putin is one of the more reasonable leaders left.  After him, there’s a line of hardcore leaders who feel like Russia has suffered enough embarrassment from the West.     Don’t poke the bear!

1311007569821995010 2020-09-30 02:18:56 +0800 <Josef1601> “Tongues” in the New Testament was “dialektos” where we get dialects or languages.     Charismatics and Pentecostal might mean well, but they ain’t speaking in biblical tongues.    Don’t change the Bible, change your practices.
1311006636748800006 2020-09-30 02:15:14 +0800 <Josef1601> @Impurebred1 Don’t worry.  I’ve been in church all my life and I’ve never heard ANYONE speak in “tongues.”  Know why?  Because in the Bible the word for “tongues” is dialektos which is a “local language”.   A language with all the grammatical rules therewith.   Look in Acts, it was LANGUAGES
1310983745361645569 2020-09-30 00:44:16 +0800 <Josef1601> @BibiWhatThe As Trump’s lord tells his followers, “do [and believe] as thou [or Satanic Q] wilt”.    Peace.

1310650157445378050 2020-09-29 02:38:42 +0800 <Josef1601> Jesus, God’s perfect lamb, is our atonement.    “But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.” Isaiah 53:5 KJV  https://t.co/j2ezrxGXGN

1310570344927895552 2020-09-28 21:21:34 +0800 <Josef1601> The Trump tax story is scary for the entire world.

1310387454478868486 2020-09-28 09:14:49 +0800 <Josef1601> That’s why so called Christians daring to say that Trump is answered prayer, get this fundamental truth wrong.    Trump is indeed answered prayer.  The prayer of those we’ve oppressed, killed and starved overseas for God to judge America.    God gave the nation to the wicked.
1310387453396647936 2020-09-28 09:14:49 +0800 <Josef1601> to continuous lies and blasphemies.     Don’t say God Bless America while America oppressed the poor and steals FOR the rich.  Kills innocents overseas, deprives justice at home, perpetuates wars for profit.    God ain’t blessing those who do evil, who lie and call it “politics”.
1310387452134162432 2020-09-28 09:14:49 +0800 <Josef1601>  https://t.co/Gao7hLk5zE  The world knows that DC was designed to attract spirit entities to further the agenda of the “Light Bearer”, Lucifer.    Real Christians would have repented, cried and wailed for their nation.  They would have demanded truth, transparency and an end
1310387451035365378 2020-09-28 09:14:48 +0800 <Josef1601> Besides the obvious phallic symbol of the Washington Monument, the service occurred before the Lincoln Temple.   Savior of the Union "In this temple, as in the hearts of the people for whom he saved the Union, the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever."
1310380804002975746 2020-09-28 08:48:24 +0800 <Josef1601> @_leolionheart_ @Khayah_144k “Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.” Jeremiah 50:12 KJV  Babylon is falling and my soul rejoices witnessing the fulfillment of His Word.  Repay her Lord!
1310377650775613440 2020-09-28 08:35:52 +0800 <Josef1601> Lost a bunch of Babylonian Christians yesterday by saying the obvious:  “in vain they pray”.    Repentance is the key to forgiveness and healing.   There’s a long list of sins the American “Church/Christian” must atone for so praying for/to an idol is just par for the course.
1310362977191825409 2020-09-28 07:37:33 +0800 <Josef1601> @santiagomayer_ Puebla is calling!🎉🇲🇽

1310208988794019840 2020-09-27 21:25:40 +0800 <Josef1601> Babylon (the hindermost of empires) acted wickedly from its inception.    Judgment pronounced:  “Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.” Jeremiah 50:12 KJV
1310200881401528320 2020-09-27 20:53:27 +0800 <Josef1601> Did #Turkey just pushed #Azerbaijan into starting WW3?  #Erdogan’s dream of a Neo Ottoman Empire has to come to an end.
1310193483198722049 2020-09-27 20:24:03 +0800 <Josef1601> 2020 is not done.
1310192795106324480 2020-09-27 20:21:19 +0800 <Josef1601> The Office of the Presidency is the Throne of the Beast.    No other way to describe the mass genocide it commits while receiving the support of so many.  Truly diabolical.
1310189000758525952 2020-09-27 20:06:14 +0800 <Josef1601> @EGarca8 The vast majority of American mainline Christianity is surely blind.    Where are they on racism, brutality, endless wars, injustice and so many issues affecting their own community.   Where are they when Trump lies, blasphemes, tramples the law, etc?  The cheer and approve.
1310187857131089921 2020-09-27 20:01:41 +0800 <Josef1601> @renegade_times I like it!   Creative and 💯% correct!
1310026150496940032 2020-09-27 09:19:08 +0800 <Josef1601> Forgot to add the most important:  Sin filled and unrepentant.

1310010963001856005 2020-09-27 08:18:47 +0800 <Josef1601> Antichrist is here.    Voting for the antichrist means casting your lots (support) for his agenda.    Value eternity and see things through spiritual eyes.
1310009773589516289 2020-09-27 08:14:03 +0800 <Josef1601> New perspective:  What if Trump is the mirrored image of American Evangelicals?  What if American Evanglicals and Trump are one and the same?  Arrogant, proud and self-righteous, truly in vain they pray.   Well deserved judgment is here.

In reality, the US runs the UN-that's why its headquarters are in NY.    Under Trump, the US is failing in all aspects.  That's the occultic  "winning".
1307679711305379841 2020-09-20 21:55:13 +0800 <Josef1601> Trump's is the master of deception.  On one hand he claims a desire to withdraw from the ME, while on the other, he sends more troops.   Claims to want to leave Syria, then sends more troops.   Trump ignores the constitution and all laws.  That's why he's the lawless one.

1307275976058064897 2020-09-19 19:10:55 +0800 <Josef1601> Learn about them.   Begin to practice them.  Little by little.
1307275975336636420 2020-09-19 19:10:55 +0800 <Josef1601> in our churches as they preached that the "old" was nailed to the cross.  BUT, they celebrate NEW festivals many of which have 100% pagan origins.  So, we exchanged God's days for those dedicated to false idols.  God's holidays are beautiful and full of messianic symbolism.
1307275974665535488 2020-09-19 19:10:55 +0800 <Josef1601> Remember to get right with God during these days leading up to Yon Kippur (Sept. 27-28).  Yon Kippur was God's way for His people to look forward to the atoning sacrifice of His Son, whose precious blood cleanses us from all sins.    They never taught us about God's holidays
1307272299012390917 2020-09-19 18:56:18 +0800 <Josef1601> @Luvjbms @theflowernurse If the city people behaved more like MOST Country people, we wouldn't have 98% of our problems.  Country folks are the salt of the earth....that's why there's been a war against them.

Grand juries hear EVIDENCE and for manslaughter, what counts are the actions causing the death.  All other matters, comments, views, etc., are irrelevant and not taken into account for that charge.

1302779504302096386 2020-09-07 09:23:32 +0800 <Josef1601> @michae1c1 @SamParkerSenate No.   You were triggered by a small part of a larger story.    I’m only questioning this because people on both sides are quick to jump to conclusions.     On BOTH sides.     Judge carefully, equally and righteously.
1302776262163943425 2020-09-07 09:10:39 +0800 <Josef1601> @PrendieC @SamParkerSenate He did.

1302776025122824196 2020-09-07 09:09:43 +0800 <Josef1601> @Ham__On__Rye @SamParkerSenate Clear as day.  Thank you.
1302775805697822721 2020-09-07 09:08:51 +0800 <Josef1601> @Callme_Marie_ Nope.  The poster wanted an emotional response to cast this Black man in the worst possible light possible.   The edited video raises a number of questions and I’ve seen enough to surmise that this was the result of a great provocation.
1302774973833056256 2020-09-07 09:05:32 +0800 <Josef1601> We’re headed for absolute pre/post-election chaos.       Don’t fall into the traps of division.  Love your neighbor, repent and get ready.    https://t.co/ShEp0ehGOi
1302772833026813952 2020-09-07 08:57:02 +0800 <Josef1601> Keep this in mind👇 https://t.co/Fm9SZ767vy  It is a Republican governor who opened the camps.
1302772294700470272 2020-09-07 08:54:54 +0800 <Josef1601> @entefuhrer @SamParkerSenate Where did you read that?
1302772146545012741 2020-09-07 08:54:18 +0800 <Josef1601> @lowryrf @SamParkerSenate Oh the entire clip matters.  There might be great provocations/threats there.
1302770494400335873 2020-09-07 08:47:44 +0800 <Josef1601> Ohio’s governor just activated FEMA concentration camps to house asymptomatic and symptomatic Covid exposes persons.    This is the lie that a Republican governor used to activate FEMA concentration camps.
1302769374718287873 2020-09-07 08:43:17 +0800 <Josef1601> @amaninthewild @SamParkerSenate I don’t know what in my tweet caused you to respond like this but ok then.    By the way, many “looters” are agent provocateurs and white communists who have suffered ZERO discrimation their entire lives.
1302767931571531776 2020-09-07 08:37:33 +0800 <Josef1601> @shantyire @SamParkerSenate What?   You’re answering the wrong tweet.
1302767761110822912 2020-09-07 08:36:53 +0800 <Josef1601> @copeland_cody @SamParkerSenate Thanks but issuing judgment on a small part is not what I’m into.   Why edit things?   Let’s see the evidence.
1302760752797945858 2020-09-07 08:09:02 +0800 <Josef1601> @844y @SamParkerSenate ???   Ok.   I’m just calling for the whole clip as this was obviously edited.
1302759212074893312 2020-09-07 08:02:54 +0800 <Josef1601> @SamParkerSenate Yeap.   Replayed this many times.     “Coon” Hit “Told your ass”  The video was edited to hide what I suspect is a provocation.     In this day and age, weigh things carefully before judging even what’s before you.    Everything is upside down—don’t fall for deception.
1302759074241671175 2020-09-07 08:02:22 +0800 <Josef1601> Yeap.   Replayed this many times.     “Coon” Hit “Told your ass”  The video was edited to hide what I suspect is a provocation.

1302752905376788480 2020-09-07 07:37:51 +0800 <Josef1601> @SamParkerSenate Did he say “coon” before leveled?   No excuse but that’s super provocative.  Would like to see the entire shot as this can be manipulated to show an “unprovoked” attack.
1302660486459199488 2020-09-07 01:30:36 +0800 <Josef1601> @JoeSmithMean @JonahofNinevah @jan46631185 One of the many anti-Christs for sure.    But he holds the office of the King of the Daughter of Babylon, the Beast, the Lawless One.    And NO doubt Babylon America, the hindermost of nations, has been adjudicated and its judgment is here.
1302647210341994496 2020-09-07 00:37:51 +0800 <Josef1601> @TheFlatEartherr Just came off a vacation.  Turned off phone and internet for a few days.   It was truly marvelous.

Thank God and keep on preaching!     Preach even if you’re left with one follower.  Preach!
1302605003270610944 2020-09-06 21:50:08 +0800 <Josef1601> I do follow for follow.  I’ll get to you!👊✊🔥
1302601966040870913 2020-09-06 21:38:04 +0800 <Josef1601> He’s right.👇
1302601823321305089 2020-09-06 21:37:30 +0800 <Josef1601> 🤣😂👇  Grew up in politics and supported Republicans and Democrats.  Met a ton of who’s who.    The higher ups have nothing but contempt for evangelicals.    Evangelical leaders know this as they’re in on it.  Many just preach for profit but hate their people.    Sick indeed.
1302600139123691526 2020-09-06 21:30:48 +0800 <Josef1601> @T_Sidd Exactly.

1302595362960572418 2020-09-06 21:11:50 +0800 <Josef1601> The prophet Daniel saw these deals and wrote: “by peace he shall destroy many.”  Daniel 8:25  Trump is the Beast.  His peace deals will destroy and oppress the weak and the poor while enriching the greedy and vile.    The Beast System = compliance through coercion.
1302590020419596290 2020-09-06 20:50:36 +0800 <Josef1601> Who is NOT voting this election?
1302589471897063424 2020-09-06 20:48:25 +0800 <Josef1601> @theflowernurse Same here.  I realized my mistake right after the election when he appointed all the Bush gang into positions of power and came out so strong for Zionist Israel.   Knew then it was a mistake.   Many many like us.

1302012057248825346 2020-09-05 06:33:59 +0800 <Josef1601> @BibiWhatThe I remember Reagan.   Trump is no Reagan.
1301949113949253632 2020-09-05 02:23:52 +0800 <Josef1601> @BibiWhatThe Trump is the master of deceit prophesied long ago.    His army of worshippers will defend the indefensible, calling evil good and good evil.    That’s why they will suffer the same judgment.
1301913319381532672 2020-09-05 00:01:38 +0800 <Josef1601> @maria_totus Así es!
1301905033739431937 2020-09-04 23:28:42 +0800 <Josef1601> 🤣😂  What say you now Evangelicals?  The Man of Sin will deceive even the elect!
1301726028423933952 2020-09-04 11:37:24 +0800 <Josef1601> What’s up with this group and other people’s identities?  Surnames, nationalities, cultures, land, Biblical promises...never ends.
1301723216260534274 2020-09-04 11:26:14 +0800 <Josef1601> @2_BEAST_SYSTEMS Just another blasphemer.  Block and move on.
1301707776230674432 2020-09-04 10:24:53 +0800 <Josef1601> Ohio is a RED state.    Followers of Christ, real patriots, and constitutionalists will ALL have Covid.    This 👇 will be their medicine.  https://t.co/s1PR2ZLN4F
1301704452311838722 2020-09-04 10:11:40 +0800 <Josef1601> But Trump will win.   He’s the Chosen One that will send millions of “losers” to their grave.    The Man of Sin, The Lawless One...  To him, life and all that’s sacred has ZERO value.   Remain blind...you’ll get it soon.     Your end is near.

God grants nations the leaders they deserve.    “And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings... Daniel 2:21 KJV  Trump heralds the judgment of Babylon.  That’s why he’s the chosen one—for judgment.
