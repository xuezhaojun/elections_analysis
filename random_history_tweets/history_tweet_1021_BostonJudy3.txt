1339763593001185280 2020-12-18 10:45:06 +0800 <BostonJudy3> 🔥What is known, is the Trump administration is delaying distribution of Pfizer vaccines, while over 3000 Americans die of Covid each day. It’s not known if the reduced allotments signal that those doses were sent elsewhere; Putin, the black market, or Trump friends. Thoughts?
1339763591935877120 2020-12-18 10:45:06 +0800 <BostonJudy3> 🔥2. Earlier, reporting said that the US inexplicably declined to order more vaccines, when Pfizer offered. The US Govt did not fund the Pfizer vaccine. It is not known if any of the Trump family or associates have a financial interest in other vaccine companies. Contd👇
1339763590467825665 2020-12-18 10:45:06 +0800 <BostonJudy3> 🔥1. Trump administration has cut the vaccine allotments to many states by 30-40%.

By starting 25th discussions, starting impeachment again, whatever we need to do. What we can’t do is passively sit by while he burns down the house.

The Cabinet and leadership need to be pressured to do their jobs. Will it succeed? Probably not. But a conversation needs to be started. We cannot ignore the fact that he’s burning down the house.

1324453485002240002 2020-11-06 04:48:12 +0800 <BostonJudy3> Trump is now apparently making accusations about the Nevada vote. So the strategy is what? Any time Biden is ahead, he refutes the result? Because that is an abuse of voters. I’m not just not ok with that. Mr. Trump. Don’t make me stop this car.
1324401976864608265 2020-11-06 01:23:32 +0800 <BostonJudy3> When this is over we need better leadership at the DNC and DCCC. Period. This is on them .    https://t.co/5kRyjyLniK

But that doesn’t stop me from using my critical thinking skills to figure out how Dem voters are best served. It’s about them, not Nancy.

It is not a one reason answer, and I don’t have enough characters. But Pelosi and Schumer were not on top of it, and so I blame them. But most of all I blame the DCCC and DNC ...we need new leadership there. Pronto.
1324397601689657349 2020-11-06 01:06:09 +0800 <BostonJudy3> @rons_mkay @robinandriver @alissakmclean @hshaban I am not a huge fan of AOC. I am not a fan of restricting Dem Candidates from running against incumbents. This is not a union, and the voters should be able to be represented by who they prefer. This is about voters, not politicians.
1324397089644752898 2020-11-06 01:04:06 +0800 <BostonJudy3> @SpeakerPelosi This Dem House rule is unfair to Dem voters who may actually want a choice between two Dems in a primary. If you make Dem voters angry and disenfranchise them, you lose them. You are wrong on the Madame Speaker. I’m a moderate btw.

I’ve lost a bit of respect for him. I love Nancy. But to have lost seats right now is ridiculous. Also, not happy with no stimulus. We need to be tough on our own leaders too.

1323401105670361088 2020-11-03 07:06:25 +0800 <BostonJudy3> Biden: "Everyone should have access to healthcare. We will protect the ACA &amp; improve it to give Americans more choice; reduce costs, &amp; be easier to navigate."  #BidenHarris #BH003  https://t.co/SD7s9IvhQr
1323401072686280704 2020-11-03 07:06:17 +0800 <BostonJudy3> Biden opposes privatizing Social Security. He has a plan for removing penalties; long-term fund solvency, &amp; higher benefits for the oldest/most vulnerable people.  #BidenHarris #BH005  https://t.co/ZfcXuOXTq3
1323401034694299649 2020-11-03 07:06:08 +0800 <BostonJudy3> Biden is committed to reducing gun violence. He will hold mfgrs. accountable, get assault weapons off our streets, enact universal bkground cks &amp; reduce stockpiling.  #BidenHarris #BH006  https://t.co/a70Ybjjgob
1323400996039569408 2020-11-03 07:05:59 +0800 <BostonJudy3> Biden's Racial &amp; Social Justice Proposals will expand access for families of color to affordable housing, higher ed, fair compensation &amp; clean energy.  #BidenHarris #BH007  https://t.co/X0YgEd9DuU
1323400958928424960 2020-11-03 07:05:50 +0800 <BostonJudy3> In his 1st 100 days, Biden will reverse the cruelty 45 enforced on immigrant families.

1323400927701803014 2020-11-03 07:05:43 +0800 <BostonJudy3> Biden’s clean energy plan will create millions of construction, skilled trades, &amp; engineering jobs to build a new American infrastructure &amp; clean energy economy.

1323400628794740737 2020-11-03 07:04:32 +0800 <BostonJudy3> A candidate running for office does not get to decide when the election is called.   That is up to the state election officials. NO election has been certified the night of the election.   It takes time to #CountEveryVote #VotersDecide  https://t.co/jsHnBfpjuF
1323400437131845633 2020-11-03 07:03:46 +0800 <BostonJudy3> Voting should be easy.   It hasn't been, but we have persevered. We've voted by mail, early in person, or we have a plan to vote on election day.  Now we have to make sure that every single vote is counted.  #CountEveryVote #DemCast  https://t.co/xaGBBlALRb
1323400371218325504 2020-11-03 07:03:30 +0800 <BostonJudy3> Voting is the most impactful, non-violent tool we have.  The will of the people will not be denied.

1323400194260668416 2020-11-03 07:02:48 +0800 <BostonJudy3> We need to vote and then be ready to WAIT for all the votes to be counted. A delay in the results is normal to allow election workers time to count all the absentee ballots.   #CountEveryVote #DemCast  https://t.co/RmIndzMpZL
1323400132029800448 2020-11-03 07:02:33 +0800 <BostonJudy3> There are checks and balances in place to make sure the ballot counting process is secure and ballots are counted accurately. Even though we may not know the winner of the election on election night we need to be patient and #CountEveryVote.  #VotersDecide  https://t.co/hHTl6ZesJM
1323400037049733120 2020-11-03 07:02:11 +0800 <BostonJudy3> With higher numbers of mail ballots, it takes time to count all the votes. We may not know the final results on election night.  Ensuring we #CountEveryVote is more important than quick results. #VotersDecide  https://t.co/GIWUHEjUir
1323399981685002241 2020-11-03 07:01:57 +0800 <BostonJudy3> Who gets to decide an election outcome?  The voters.  Be patient and let's #CountEveryVote.  #DemCast  https://t.co/kA735xeX7r
1323399910742511619 2020-11-03 07:01:40 +0800 <BostonJudy3> 72 million ballots are expected to be sent by mail.  This includes armed service members overseas, citizens abroad, and voters here in the States voting safely from the comfort of their own home.  Let's count 'em all.  #CountEveryVote #DemCast  https://t.co/4F4q3WipHQ

1322685621660430336 2020-11-01 07:43:21 +0800 <BostonJudy3> This is misleading. The predictor is the average of several polls. They are still tied. Less experienced people are on the desk on weekends. Fact check everything. I’m disappointed in Politico.

1321510471942479872 2020-10-29 01:53:43 +0800 <BostonJudy3> 3. We need vision, bold ideas and a willingness to try new things. We don’t need Senators wedded to the 1960s-1970s, and unwilling to hear the voices of all Americans. Because the Chairs affect all of us, not just one state.

Should the Committee Chairs be selected by a bipartisan group based on talent, ability knowledge of the area, not same-old? Maybe they would do a better job and try harder? 👇  #DemCast  #wtpBlue  #ONEV1  https://t.co/0d4ml2O8Tx

1320750614557696000 2020-10-26 23:34:19 +0800 <BostonJudy3> The Wisconsin Republican legislature has suppressed the vote, stacked the state Supreme Court, ignored Covid, and stripped the Dem Governor of powers. Can we all spare $10 today to help save Wisconsin? #DemCastWI  #wtpBlue  #ONEV1
1320749692263768066 2020-10-26 23:30:39 +0800 <BostonJudy3> The Wisconsin Legislature has suppressed the vote and taken away the Dem Governors’  powers. Can you donate $10 to help?  https://t.co/2eiXdTQyVG

He likes to give money to Corporations and rich people. He won’t listen to you, but you can answer with your vote for @AmyMcGrathKY who will help you.  #DemCast #wtpBlue  #ONEV1  https://t.co/vhrrwX1gXl
1317614700075548672 2020-10-18 07:53:19 +0800 <BostonJudy3> 2. To blame Dems. Here’s the thing. Trump, Pelosi and Democrats want to pass a bigger bill to help you. McConnell is refusing. (Trump thinks it will win him votes). When Dems vote against it, it will be because they want to help families first(Contd)  #DemCast  #ONEV1  #wtpBlue  https://t.co/FlR1YaibdJ
1317614694824349697 2020-10-18 07:53:18 +0800 <BostonJudy3> 🚨1.Kentucky! Your Senator is playing a political game next week at YOUR expense. He’s betting you won’t see through it. He doesn’t want to give you much stimulus money, so he is pushing a bill to help small businesses, knowing it will fail.  (Contd) #DemCast  #ONEV1  #wtpSenate  https://t.co/ISgAyus7sz

1314647287247900672 2020-10-10 03:21:52 +0800 <BostonJudy3> It’s hypocritical for the GOP to make an issue of a possible extramarital affair, when Trump himself has such a horrid history with women. They hope it will win them a Senate seat. Maybe they should focus on doing a good job, instead. #DemCastMI  #wtpSenate  #ONEV1  https://t.co/yrFgWLSFQd

An antibody test may not show if you have a current COVID-19 infection because it can take 1–3 weeks after infection for your body to make antibodies  Trump had antibodies on Sun/Mon.

1313490226845806594 2020-10-06 22:44:08 +0800 <BostonJudy3> I’m sure every MD and most RNs across the country wish they could sound an alarm about Trump’s bizarre behavior.  The Dexamethasone he is on is inducing a sense of euphoria and artificial well-being, which in Trump is manifested by grandiosity.

1312972045441957888 2020-10-05 12:25:04 +0800 <BostonJudy3> It was the responsibility of the Physician to not let Trump go out and spread Covid .

1312801076769415171 2020-10-05 01:05:42 +0800 <BostonJudy3> @jennobenno I think he has had Covid for a week. My own guess, but thats my thought. He is a bit further along in the disease process. I suppose they are hoping to save him because he is POTUS. I think he was contagious on Tuesday.
1312799568833245184 2020-10-05 00:59:42 +0800 <BostonJudy3> @JoeBiden @DrBiden please replace Symone Sanders as spokesperson (just was on MSNBC). Comes across as defensive, angry/belligerent  with even friendly journalists. Does you no favors. Tapper is annoying too, today, but that’s a different Tweet.

1312792612500320257 2020-10-05 00:32:03 +0800 <BostonJudy3> @peterbakernyt @williamgibbard He is worse than they say, reading between the lines. I guarantee you that if he goes back to the WH, tomorrow, it will after the Docs caution him to stay in the hospital. They should keep him, if only to protect everyone from him, since he won’t wear a mask.

1312789259934404608 2020-10-05 00:18:44 +0800 <BostonJudy3> @JohnCornyn The reason that Texas may turn blue is that Texans are sick and tired of being lied to by party hacks. I’m looking at you John.
1312788774632468481 2020-10-05 00:16:48 +0800 <BostonJudy3> Not surprisingly, we have been lied to since Trump became infected. About the timeline, symptoms, treatments and general condition. But, then again, that’s how dictators roll.  Bizarre country right now, run by clowns.  @JoeBiden Restore sanity.

1311137624451616768 2020-09-30 10:55:44 +0800 <BostonJudy3> South Carolina, you saw it. He is out of control. He cannot even do a debate. The choice is between a megalomaniac who intends to stay in power regardless of the vote, and asked the Proud Boys to stand by. @JoeBiden is the only choice. #DemCastSC #ONEV1  #wtpGOTV

1311124978260152323 2020-09-30 10:05:28 +0800 <BostonJudy3> For the next debate there has to be  a loud buzzer, fact checking and mics shut off. That being said Joe is doing great under ridiculous circumstances.

That’s why just this year, good Republicans are not voting with a bad party.

1303710541362401281 2020-09-09 23:03:09 +0800 <BostonJudy3> It all depends upon the suburbs and the Black voters in Michigan.

1301203860158058496 2020-09-03 01:02:30 +0800 <BostonJudy3> Here’s a comical post from Micro. As if he is unaware that nothing has been done about Russian bounties and election interference with Republican collusion. I guess he wants Twitter to take care of it.
1301202997486268419 2020-09-03 00:59:04 +0800 <BostonJudy3> @marcorubio Marco, maybe it’s time the Republicans stopped working with the Russian disinformation election interference? Just a thought.
1301197880787689477 2020-09-03 00:38:44 +0800 <BostonJudy3> @SueWagnerWhite @realDonaldTrump Susan your comments are not helpful. Unless you are supporting Trump’s pressuring the FDA to approve a vaccine prior to Stage three approvals. Not discussing this with you anymore.

They don’t wave a flag, they just roll up their sleeves and get to work. In October and November, they will do it again. Vote early @JoeBiden   #DemCastMI  #DemCast  https://t.co/KaPcw1eEE4

1300960520388960256 2020-09-02 08:55:33 +0800 <BostonJudy3> @SueWagnerWhite @realDonaldTrump Correct. So if you want to take a vaccine that may further damage you, go ahead.

1300822030259032065 2020-09-01 23:45:14 +0800 <BostonJudy3> Steve Daines only talks with Chinese.  Not Montanans. What would he say about Trump allowing Russians to put a bounty on American soldiers heads? 6 Million infections and 183,000 dead?   @stevebullockmt  talks to Montana!  #DemCastMT  #ONEV1  #DemCast   https://t.co/u3F51GSdFe
1300815136018628609 2020-09-01 23:17:51 +0800 <BostonJudy3> @TiffanyATrump Tiffany, Attorneys need to be very, very careful about telling lies to the public. Bar Associations don’t like that.
1300813794030104580 2020-09-01 23:12:31 +0800 <BostonJudy3> Covid Vaccine This was the result when a drug (Thalidomide) was approved and widely used without thorough testing and research. Wear a mask until vaccines are vetted and approved by physicians, not @realDonaldTrump .   #DemCast  #ONEV1  https://t.co/78YGDeRZYZ
1300809920258945024 2020-09-01 22:57:07 +0800 <BostonJudy3> From the man suggesting we inject bleach If true, @AmerMedicalAssn will weigh in on whether a vaccine should be released before Stage 3 trials are complete. They will say no, it is not safe. That the risk outweighs the possible benefit. Listen to them.  #DemCast  #ONEV1
1300806836908687360 2020-09-01 22:44:52 +0800 <BostonJudy3> CAUTION VOTERS Does your state use poll books to sign voters in? Check below. If so, know that they’re hackable, and request that your state provide paper backups! They caused problems in past elections resulting in 8 hour waits to vote #DemCast  #ONEV1    https://t.co/IzMHXsFXE4
