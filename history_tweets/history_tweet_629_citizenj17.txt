1342934668690092034 2020-12-27 04:45:50 +0800 <citizenj17> @TheMarinaTimes so where‚Äôs @chesaboudin getting his stats from? He swears crime is down in #SanFrancisco. I guess having daddy issues can impair your judgement.
1342934342469734401 2020-12-27 04:44:32 +0800 <citizenj17> @DellDurant4 I noticed that people who are against racism makes it all about race and make decisions based on race.

1339673714548383746 2020-12-18 04:47:58 +0800 <citizenj17> @hknightsf as usual, no enforcement. also, so many rules and lockdowns and we have more deaths and cases than other states. It makes you question if destroying livelihoods and the economy was worth it. #California #SanFrancisco #COVID19

1339469195247927296 2020-12-17 15:15:16 +0800 <citizenj17> @bettersoma what an interesting article: ‚Äú#Tenderloin has drug prices that are low because prosecution pressure is low. ‚Äú Thus, @chesaboudin should be held liable for the 300+ deaths from #Fentanyl

1329533359291133953 2020-11-20 05:13:49 +0800 <citizenj17> @SanFranDamn 1/2 I don't know, sorry. He's and a white BMW were Ellis in opposite directions. He smashed the windows of the BMW, which took off. Then he started smashing the windows of the parked black car when the cops yelled at him and then he took off. Road rage?

1324397685885988865 2020-11-06 01:06:29 +0800 <citizenj17> @michelletandler I am not a Republican but voted for Trump because I live in San Francisco and saw in the past few years how San Francisco's Democrats have turned the city into filthy streets, open drug dealing/use, sanctioned crime. That's why I am scared of Democrats.

1324188191222505473 2020-11-05 11:14:01 +0800 <citizenj17> @SanFranDamn agreed. I voted for Hillary on 2016. I voted for Trump in 2020 ONLY because I see how #Democrat rule have destroyed #SanFrancisco.

1324109293075927040 2020-11-05 06:00:30 +0800 <citizenj17> @SanFranDamn @sfbos @LondonBreed correct. People of #Oregon just have to scroll through #SanFrancisco on twitter to see their future. No crystal ball needed.

1324108130599333889 2020-11-05 05:55:53 +0800 <citizenj17> @SanFranDamn @richieSF2016 for the business tax overhaul, it was sold to voters like helping small business  with a lower threshold of $2M to pay gross receipts tax but the tax rates will change. At end end, if business pay higher taxes, the consumers pay higher prices.

You see @chesaboudin, shoplifting is not a victimless crime or simple wealth distribution. #SanFrancisco. Citizens do pay for the @sfgov allowing shoplifting.

1308424104018456577 2020-09-22 23:13:10 +0800 <citizenj17> @JohnSungKim @PatrickDlesk_SF Agreed. I always suspect true cost is a lot higher. Besides ER, ambulances, think of other indirect costs: broken meters (when they try to pull coins), power washing the streets, turd pick up by DPW, cleaning up debris, etc...

1303420388043489280 2020-09-09 03:50:11 +0800 <citizenj17> @sfchronicle As I started reading the article, I thought it was another language police piece. I agree with the last part of the article that existing wine language should not be restricted or vilified but expanded.

I don't see that in other cities but this shithole (#SanFrancisco)! When I see them, I daydreaming of picking those speaks and smashing them on the street. But you don't that won't end well for me :(

1300820142297808898 2020-09-01 23:37:44 +0800 <citizenj17> @BastionoftheBay also, article says ‚Äúthe remaining six declined services and left the area.‚Äù Translation: Those 6 junkies don‚Äôt want help and will open a junkie tent somewhere else in #SanFrancisco #abc7now #ktvu #California

1300813205166460929 2020-09-01 23:10:10 +0800 <citizenj17> @sfmta_muni will start enforcing residential parking permits 9/14. When are you allowing small business to reopen @LondonBreed? If the city can make money, small businesses should too #SanFrancisco #COVID19  https://t.co/z9oW5R17EB

1300632954398322688 2020-09-01 11:13:55 +0800 <citizenj17> @SanFranDamn I agree with the article mainly that white liberals have run cities for decades where minorities are suffering and live in bad parts or town. Also, Joe Biden wanted to pick any woman of color as VP to get minorities‚Äô votes. That‚Äôs insulting.
1300590157406457859 2020-09-01 08:23:51 +0800 <citizenj17> lol... that‚Äôs a freeloader I can support
