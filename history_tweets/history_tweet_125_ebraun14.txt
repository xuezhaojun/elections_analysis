In October we will  have support for more scale for select users who want to try it out"
1305824420532031488 2020-09-15 19:02:57 +0800 <ebraun14> @frame_vr Excellent addition! Ts could keep single user on for Ss to explore content, then just hit The Switch when it's time to meet up and discuss! Come Oct. when 30 users at once = reality, this is top of my list to share with my Ts! Keep up the good work @frame_vr @gabrieljbaker !!!
