I’ve never seen Trump supporters beating up people burning buildings &amp;looting but democrats have. The difference is when we say war is a war of ideas &amp;dems mean physical war

I predict you will hear fake results amplified by the media and when Trump disputes , they will scream he’s destroying democracy and refuses to concede.

1324000108141289481 2020-11-04 22:46:39 +0800 <BVR58915778> @DrShayPhD The @FoxNews channel is the biggest enemy to conservatives. At least CNN doesn’t make money from our viewership. But Fox makes money and stabs us in the back
1323999498415362050 2020-11-04 22:44:13 +0800 <BVR58915778> @DrShayPhD Coincidentally, I remember Fox called the election early for democrats and many people leaving work didn’t even show up to vote bec they thought it was over. Guess who was in charge of that? Chris Stirewalt yep the same fat obnoxious piece of excrement in charge this time
1323998345925451776 2020-11-04 22:39:39 +0800 <BVR58915778> Mark my words. The hatred and thirst for blood &amp;revenge will be disproportionate. If communism takes this country it’s all over. We really have no place to go. Once they fully take a grip, nobody’s safe. This is a global effort to take down capitalism IT WILL GET UGLY quickly
