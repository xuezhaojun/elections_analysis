1344051054485372936 2020-12-30 06:41:57 +0800 <Skel531> @girlsreallyrule I Robot cringeworthy.
1344049081358962689 2020-12-30 06:34:06 +0800 <Skel531> @grantstern Looks rediculous. You know McConnell mentioned stupid Space Force in his speech today.  Billions dollar budget for an Administrstive Staff.  If tRump can take Military bucks for wall, Biden can take to feed people!  Scrap the Stupid Space Force!
1344048076881862661 2020-12-30 06:30:07 +0800 <Skel531> @JoyceWhiteVance Have @USPS tracked items that have just stalled since Dec.14th. All it says is received &amp; arriving late.  Doesn’t even say where it’s at.  @UPS pretty much is in same boat - nothing has moved on tracking since before Xmas.  Thank God it wasn’t meds or much needed kitty treats!
1343983724594159619 2020-12-30 02:14:24 +0800 <Skel531> @ChrisMurphyCT @GeorgeTakei @SenSchumer @BernieSanders What McConnell’s going to do is try &amp; add 230 Repeal. It’s his play to say ‘I am all Power’.  If Dems say no, they look bad. If Dems agree with change adding 230 issue, he gets back in djt good graces.  Come on Dems, think hard, there’s a work around. Play out all the scenarios!
1343978784412852226 2020-12-30 01:54:46 +0800 <Skel531> @yashar I’m telling you, the hotel knows who she is. She’d stayed there 3 days prior.   Also, she retrieved cell phone from front desk where Uber driver dropped it off. It was there at the time this incident took place.  Further proof they have her name.
1343976612669366272 2020-12-30 01:46:08 +0800 <Skel531> @IAmSophiaNelson You need to consider the source of this poll release. Reading person who released is ?able.

There are stills out there with her unmasked, can’t believe she hasn’t been identified.  However, there were lot of false ids floated this a.m.-really hurt some innocent people.

Only thing in common is worship of djt. Could they be reforming into new grp?  Political motive - to force Marshall Law (i.e., Gen. Nutball Flynn)?

1342640969783586822 2020-12-26 09:18:46 +0800 <Skel531> @waltshaub Don’t understand that aspect of @TwitterSupport @Twitter that isn’t listed anywhere in their how to or rules.  Used to happen all the time to me, now I can’t respond as much as I’d like.  Very unnerving.
1342583202465112066 2020-12-26 05:29:14 +0800 <Skel531> @AymanM Good one!
1342560987354951680 2020-12-26 04:00:57 +0800 <Skel531> @BeschlossDC Is this when the airplanes landed?  tRump history.
1342553618726195209 2020-12-26 03:31:40 +0800 <Skel531> @kaitlancollins ‘Is praying’.  Yeah right!
1342552694989451264 2020-12-26 03:28:00 +0800 <Skel531> @donwinslow I believe any other president would have stayed by phone, gotten updates, been briefed on how to proceed, and definitely come out with a statement to the American people to reassure them.  I’ll bet he never addresses the American people, unless it’s a Stone setup to blame Aunt T!
1342551491505221633 2020-12-26 03:23:13 +0800 <Skel531> @donwinslow It happened around 6:30 a.m. which would be 5:30 a.m. eastern.  Is he up that early?
1342549087913189379 2020-12-26 03:13:40 +0800 <Skel531> @GeoRebekah That’s a great gingerbread man. Do those happen to be smarties?
1342542477417459712 2020-12-26 02:47:24 +0800 <Skel531> @yashar Who said we can’t say? I know clerks in stores were told to say Happy Holidays instead, but that was years ago.  I like stores that tell their clerks to say what holiday they celebrate- mutual respect for everyone’s beliefs.
1342541519698407430 2020-12-26 02:43:36 +0800 <Skel531> @MusicCityMissy @grantstern Subsequently found out you are correct., police confirmed on the news.  I have deleted my tweet.  Thanks
1342527318703693825 2020-12-26 01:47:10 +0800 <Skel531> @KFILE So sorry for your loss.  Bean fought the good fight, as did her parents.  Saying prayers for all of you.
1342509343539924993 2020-12-26 00:35:44 +0800 <Skel531> @GeoffRBennett We’re up to foot and half and still coming down.  It’s beautiful. Nothing beats snow on Christmas.  And mama nature works well sometimes 40 deg. next 2 days.  Merry Christmas Geoff, thanks for your insightful coverage all year.
1342461104568619014 2020-12-25 21:24:03 +0800 <Skel531> @girlsreallyrule Lovely. Merry Christmas.
1342460696009859074 2020-12-25 21:22:26 +0800 <Skel531> @TheRickyDavila After hanging Obama’s Portrait, and rehanging the ones they shoved in a closet...replace those god-awful gold curtains in Oval Office.

1342357644875591681 2020-12-25 14:32:56 +0800 <Skel531> @OhNoSheTwitnt Dreamed I was @ WH. I stood there trying to hand out masks. No one would take one. Then it got more and more crowded. I got nervous.  Went outside. Asked a woman at a table to wear one. She said, ‘oh, I suppose. My sister died last month of Covid so maybe.’  Woke up &amp; said F this
1342331063499190273 2020-12-25 12:47:19 +0800 <Skel531> @TM_Sarakham @donwinslow Wrong. They may have antibodies, but the immunity doesn’t last, and even if they are, they can still be carrying it.  Won’t effect them but can still spread to others.  Listen to science!
1342328896725917696 2020-12-25 12:38:42 +0800 <Skel531> @mikepompeo No you just used OUR money to pay for them, &amp; no one wore masks, socially distanced.  For God’s sake, there were young children in there.! Only one wearing a mask was Santa!  Lavish parties when millions starve, losing jobs &amp; homes.  You are a shameless pig.  Glad your leaving!

1342282242312306688 2020-12-25 09:33:19 +0800 <Skel531> @DrPhilGoff Ditto with jalapeños- I wear gloves.
1342268953377320960 2020-12-25 08:40:31 +0800 <Skel531> @IlhanMN They will start with the kids and the detentions, and ICE shipping asylum seekers back or to Mexico day one.  .@JoeBiden will do it. It’s a mighty big mess to untangle.  At same time there’s a lot of Boarder Patrol and ICE new-Nazis he has to get rid of.  Give him a chance.
1342251778444812288 2020-12-25 07:32:16 +0800 <Skel531> @GeorgeTakei How many years has this been the modus operandi for GOP?  I remember this crap from Nixon days (when I was a baby).  Mama always said think before you speak, then think again.
1342250883489427458 2020-12-25 07:28:43 +0800 <Skel531> @realDonaldTrump How about @twitter solves the problem.  Let’s have them cut you off this account and give the World a rest.  You really are Deplorable!
1342250491502358530 2020-12-25 07:27:09 +0800 <Skel531> @realDonaldTrump Conclusion, your a bigger POS than they are.  But your all still a POS.
1342250072168411141 2020-12-25 07:25:29 +0800 <Skel531> @ltgrusselhonore @USArmy @usairforce @USMC @USNavy @USCG Merry Christmas to you and yours Sir.  Thank you for never losing for a moment your Oath of Service. You are an inspiration.
1342249355332481026 2020-12-25 07:22:38 +0800 <Skel531> @yashar And since they don’t encourage Mask wearing in the State, the parents thought this was okay.  A lot of those children have other probs. That make them them high risk.  So all the parents have relinquished common sense to others.  So wrong!

1342137378484449281 2020-12-24 23:57:41 +0800 <Skel531> @waltshaub Like to say, Karma’s a Bitch. I may not be around to see the come-uppence, but it will happen, maybe not in this life, but it will.  I then move on to help others when I can, cause light trumps darkness, goodness trumps evil.

He’s over on Parker insighting violence, etc. against @Weinsteinlaw and @DavidCornDC and I don’t know whom else.  You can see all this crap at @parlertakes so you don’t have to go on Parker.
1341968846022987777 2020-12-24 12:48:00 +0800 <Skel531> @yashar Been covering since March and will continued.
1341966526287642624 2020-12-24 12:38:47 +0800 <Skel531> @donwinslow With Stone pardoned, please watch your back a little more.  We all should.  His and his goons will now become part of the plan.  White Supremacist Domestic Terrorists had (have) plans to take down the Power Grid to keep tRump in office.
1341963424092327937 2020-12-24 12:26:27 +0800 <Skel531> @donwinslow The GOP Bubble is fast approaching the ‘cannibalistic stage’; quickly followed by final demise of a self-corrupting, out-of-control party.  Commence feeding frenzy!
1341961264327766017 2020-12-24 12:17:52 +0800 <Skel531> Never forget👇. Do not thank @BenSasse for his statement on Pardons.  The entire @HouseGOP @SenateGOP have been enabling for 4 years.  This is on all of them.  .@GOP =&gt;Party of Un-American Fascist Seditionists  Prove me wrong.
1341953711338369024 2020-12-24 11:47:51 +0800 <Skel531> @CoriBush Oh yeah.
1341952793133920257 2020-12-24 11:44:12 +0800 <Skel531> .@robportman - this is what supporting tRump gets you.  Good Job!  We shall not forget, and 2022 will be here before you know it.  Yes, by your sycophant behavior, this IS on you.
1341950900567470082 2020-12-24 11:36:41 +0800 <Skel531> #EverybodyIsTurningOnTrump because he’s an Outright CRIMINAL.  His Pardoning of Thieves, Murderers, Liars only proves he’s DESPICABLE.

1341943647227543552 2020-12-24 11:07:52 +0800 <Skel531> @glennkirschner2 The DOJ can do something if it turns out these Pardons were ‘In Exchange’ for something.
1341943064605175814 2020-12-24 11:05:33 +0800 <Skel531> And yet, not a single @GOP Republican has said a word about these Egregious Pardons of criminals, thieves, and murderers.  By its silence the @GOP has become the party endorsing destruction of Democracy, a National Security, Constitution   GOP=&gt;Un-American Seditionists
1341941098609045504 2020-12-24 10:57:44 +0800 <Skel531> @IAmSophiaNelson Of course he will.  Only good thing I’ve heard so far is that Manafort does not get the seized millions of dollars back.
1341940312294514688 2020-12-24 10:54:37 +0800 <Skel531> @mmpadellan The scariest of which is Roger Stone.  He will now feel free to activate his goons.  What he doesn’t realize is this does not protect him from future crimes!

1341884873301225473 2020-12-24 07:14:19 +0800 <Skel531> @yashar After years of toxicity with some members of family, made decision to abandon the notions of ‘family first; yeah, but their family so you have to love them; and I’m my brother’s keeper.’  It wasn’t hurt they had done me, but to innocent others who had only tried to help them.

1341512964185206784 2020-12-23 06:36:29 +0800 <Skel531> @JRubinBlogger Policy for what, for what end purpose?  They can’t be a 501c3, maybe another kind, but not C3 cause that’s for charities.  Let’s have them have Rudy, Jenna and Sydney do the incorporation papers.  Sounds like a money laundering shell to me.
1341509622037884932 2020-12-23 06:23:12 +0800 <Skel531> @PattyArquette @donwinslow It looks so staged, just like his hair.  This and photos of Airport crowd surges are really, really, disheartening health care workers.  Many are so burned out, then add this insult, their ready to quit?
1341508904996450312 2020-12-23 06:20:21 +0800 <Skel531> @ccadelago @yashar Just rewatched. He said it exactly TWICE.    Each time he said a merry Christmas and Happy Holidays  So what!

1341496579816087553 2020-12-23 05:31:23 +0800 <Skel531> @atrupar He said it right  Merry Christmas Happy Holidays Happy New Year  What’s the big deal?  Covered all the basics.
1341496080417087488 2020-12-23 05:29:24 +0800 <Skel531> .@AmbassadorRice @jrpsaki - you all need to review everything Joe Biden has said &amp; get on same page.  Ambassador, sometimes its what you don’t say that you should have, like reversing Child Seperation,etc. will end immediately.   Because this is the major BS that results👇
1341493727538372608 2020-12-23 05:20:03 +0800 <Skel531> @NickMiroff @HelloAndrew .@JoeBiden never said he would open boarders Day 1.  He did say would stop Seperation Policy Day 1 (which continues).  It probable more fucked up than we imagine!  You phrasing as a Broken promise is a DISSERVICE to journalism.  You need talk w/ @jayrosen_nyu   Stop the Crap!

Saw this day coming from GOP since Nixon....building ever election cycle; increased incompetence &amp; criminal behavior in GOP Electors.  Begs reflection on MSM in role they’ve played.

You can sense when they’re struggling, so I have cashier hold my card indicating which ones I’m also paying - very quietly.

Which means America, over last 400 yrs, has just gotten better at not overtly saying it’s about Race.  However, it’s still about RACE.

I think it will help many people remember goodness, kindness, and that it’s the little things that make the biggest difference!

Can’t stand Durbin movies usually but this one had a lot of classic bad guys.  His best bad guy role  Watch on the Rhine  Wacky to think he was like a completely different personality in Mr. Skeffington!

You are first one to respond.  WE NEED COLLECTIVE VOICE OF House &amp; Senate right now to squash this. NOW, LOUDLY!  Please, you must all speak out, or it will be too late!
1340452692632715270 2020-12-20 08:23:20 +0800 <Skel531> @jimsciutto No. GOP will back it.  The Military issued their statement today.  They don’t talk much, but what they say speaks volumes.  And GOP will ignore the quiet, but loud call Military is sending to get this stopped.

It wouldn’t actually detonated tRump casino,  but they could time explosion to this &amp; show on wide screen.  How about it @marty_small? Make extra $ for your project - we’ll fund.

Sorry, I don’t believe it was he.  With Moderna getting approved, tRump, Warp-Spead Guy, and many GOP Legislators gained $ on their Moderna stock holdings.

I offered a mask, she took,  and as I started my spiel, said “oh, my brother just died of this, so okay, I’ll wear it.”  I woke up then saying ‘shite’  True story. NoMoreSleep 2/2

I dreamed I was at the WH with a handful of blue masks. There was a party and I kept asking people to take and wear a mask. Few did, and the crowd kept growing.  (1/2)

1339252985491283970 2020-12-17 00:56:08 +0800 <Skel531> Speech by @SenGaryPeters is a must listen to. He hits nail on the head.  This hearing is a joke and a waste of our money when millions are now sick, homeless, and starving.  Shame on @SenRonJohnson!  Everything you accused Sen. Peters of calling you is true. America agrees w/him!
1339249468106043392 2020-12-17 00:42:09 +0800 <Skel531> @iAmTheWarax @jaketapper Now can they self-reflect and Publicly acknowledge that giving the someone that caused much of the mess mega-bucks in donations was a bad idea?  Deleted them from phone long ago, only buy from local Mom and Pops!

1339050543424167936 2020-12-16 11:31:42 +0800 <Skel531> @brhodes And we got to pay for it anyhow.  I’m sure they’ll still be billing for 900.  I’m sick seeing all those kids without masks on.

Having served on juries, times when we (all jurors) knew court-assigned attorney were not representing their client’s best interest.  Not asking pertinent?’s we wanted asked to reach a fair verdict.  This case smacks of many injustices and needs to be re-opened.

I truly believe (she/tRump) think they will overthrow election with this by saying ‘see, we would have won’.  Reminds me of Billy Beer.

1338264022051909633 2020-12-14 07:26:21 +0800 <Skel531> @HelenFeathers23 You can be immune from receiving 2 doses of vaccine, come in contact w/Covid, &amp; still spread it to those who are not vaccinated.  Remember, 16 &amp; under will be last (don’t even have one for that age yet).  Immunity doesn’t negate mask &amp; other safety guidelines.(1/2)

During Nixon, escalating w/Regan, &amp; blown up more &amp; more with each Bush.  Suddenly Dems became:  Nasty, Radical, Baby-killing, Lefty Communist, etc.  GOP &amp; Conservs. made it personal/nasty. They allowed a tRump to gain power.

Fact that you all care enough to make sure every sporting event has part of band &amp; cheer section there to root for USC - too cool!  I mean, how many schools have the band at a Hockey Game?  Welcome to Democracy, you are the future!

1336440709415657477 2020-12-09 06:41:09 +0800 <Skel531> @TheRickyDavila One down at SCOTUS, one to go - that criminal from Texas asking to invalidate other States votes.  I may be wrong, but you want it to get on docket so it can be dismissed similar to today’s ruling, instead of rejected?  If rejected may end up in lower courts.
1336438054941306881 2020-12-09 06:30:36 +0800 <Skel531> @yashar Problem is who gets to assign her seat - it will be DeWine, and then we’ll have lost another seat to a GOP Seditionist.

Important is that we are still talking about needing sweeping changes, no matter what it’s called.  As a side note, every city in America should love this version.  Defund Police Unions.

1333854797347368966 2020-12-02 03:25:40 +0800 <Skel531> @TheRickyDavila Deborah Brix is the person that pushed for the hospital, City, State Numbers to be moved from CDC to private firm so WH could manipulate and screw up.  Not sure it can be fixed when @JoeBiden takes over.  Another reason to not let her anywhere near the new Covid Task Force.

1332383607801995264 2020-11-28 01:59:41 +0800 <Skel531> @glennkirschner2 Are we done with this Sheit now or can they appeal this again? With this loss and judicial ruling do they have cause to go anywhere with this, like SCOTUS?  Or is it just too absurd?  Can this ruling be used as president to toss other outstanding crap suits filed in other states?

Effect would be huge in bringing back compassion &amp; empathy.  Yep, local news - how little they cover, yet so many people watch &amp; think that’s all that’s going on in the world - OK.
1331612271487938567 2020-11-25 22:54:40 +0800 <Skel531> @DavidPepper The cruelty is the point.  And the @GOP is A-OK with Firing Squads and Electric Chairs.  A world-wide reckoning of you as the 21st Century Nazi Party is justified.
1331608760717107203 2020-11-25 22:40:43 +0800 <Skel531> @ossoff Jon. Everyone talks like @JoeBiden and Dems. will be 1 term.  Let’s start on your candidacy for 2024 NOW!  I will fully support.  Your laser focus on the subject at hand and speaking truth plainly with common sense is a rare quality.

1330299477505273857 2020-11-22 07:58:05 +0800 <Skel531> @DavidPepper They are truly hurting Democracy.  The cleanup on isle 7 is going to take years.
1330295858005487623 2020-11-22 07:43:42 +0800 <Skel531> @neal_katyal Well, would like to have seen ‘with prejudice’.  But I’ll take it.
1330294514330836993 2020-11-22 07:38:22 +0800 <Skel531> @RandyRainbow LOL.  Oh, I thank God for you every day!
1330293615562805254 2020-11-22 07:34:48 +0800 <Skel531> @CraigDMauger @michpoligal Uh, 990’s are very explicit about reporting this kind of thing!
1330293105199902722 2020-11-22 07:32:46 +0800 <Skel531> .@cnnbrk - ‘Appears’?  Do better!
1330289325452439562 2020-11-22 07:17:45 +0800 <Skel531> @VoteWarnock @MeidasTouch @J_Mei21 Wow, on the ground reviews. So good!  Really need to get one about not being a native Georgian up and running.  Sending more bucks now!
1330288648261079040 2020-11-22 07:15:03 +0800 <Skel531> @ZekeJMiller Calm down, calm down.  Making a Federal Case out of nothing.  Can’t you handle this more like adults. Maybe send his team or him a note and discuss like adults?  I know you’re all used to tRump antics after 4 years, BUT TRULY IT DOESNT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY!  cc: @JoeBiden
1330284472026226691 2020-11-22 06:58:28 +0800 <Skel531> @BMeiselas She hasn’t been exonerated- so start her commercial off with a lie?  She’s counting on #Georgians gullibility- prove her wrong.  Vote for @ReverendWarnock - he truly cares about you.
1330283449253589005 2020-11-22 06:54:24 +0800 <Skel531> @FacesOfCOVID Spending your entire family my prayers.
1330279600363089927 2020-11-22 06:39:06 +0800 <Skel531> @GregJaffe @jaketapper @sgreports Isn’t the tRump family negotiating with the Taliban?  Could have sworn a month or so ago I read this - so all good.  (not)
1330199264786583556 2020-11-22 01:19:53 +0800 <Skel531> @DavidPepper Was there a Democrat running against Householder?  Article said there were write-ins?  Just asking since all downticket races matter.  If not, Dems need better program to seek out good worthy candidates. Maybe? - just saying!
1330189793020489729 2020-11-22 00:42:15 +0800 <Skel531> @jaketapper @Kevinliptakcnn Is anyone from U.S. listed as even attending?
1330188546653753346 2020-11-22 00:37:17 +0800 <Skel531> @MeidasTouch @meiselasb This definitely needs to run on GA tv.  What we learned in Maine tells all - Gideon was not native Mainer.
1330185652198133768 2020-11-22 00:25:47 +0800 <Skel531> @Redistrict @GlennKesslerWP Same-Cleveland.  People in inner-cities - jobless, fear eviction, scared-rampant violence, starving-food deserts, WiFi deserts - EBC (even before Covid).  No way to even get to agencies that can help.  What do you think is foremost on their minds?   Both parties have failed them.
1330182393156734976 2020-11-22 00:12:50 +0800 <Skel531> @VinGuptaMD Don’t mind if she stays on at CDC, however, NO position in Biden Admin. at all.  Appeasement is not the best course of action when lives and Constitution are on the line.  Her Oath of Service was to the Constitution.   Her Oath of Do No Harm as a Dr. was to Humanity.  She failed.
1330171926405328897 2020-11-21 23:31:15 +0800 <Skel531> @jreganwilliams Thank you#, I can arrange that.
1330168159236743170 2020-11-21 23:16:17 +0800 <Skel531> @michpoligal @detroitnews Very poorly worded headline @detroitnews - Do Better.
1330164632888205318 2020-11-21 23:02:16 +0800 <Skel531> This is an INSULT to every Healthcare Worker in America.  America’s Cracks are exposed by these Assholes!
1330155063747227652 2020-11-21 22:24:14 +0800 <Skel531> @jreganwilliams Besides practicing guidelines how can we tell healthcare workers in our area that we care, how else can we help or at least let them know we appreciate?  God Bless you all.
1330000673350569988 2020-11-21 12:10:45 +0800 <Skel531> @clairecmc 3rd person to ask Claire, what’s second win?  Only heard of one.

1329978252656594946 2020-11-21 10:41:39 +0800 <Skel531> @GeorgeTakei Mayor of a city in TX said they haven’t ruled out Civil War.  I’m torn between saying Good God and bring it on asshats!  Think option 2 is GOPbs stress!
1329976622464856065 2020-11-21 10:35:11 +0800 <Skel531> @brahmresnik So did the State of Az Certify?  Is it over in AZ?  Can we stop worrying about it now?
1329975507883061248 2020-11-21 10:30:45 +0800 <Skel531> @AmyEGardner Nope, not yet, don’t trust MI Repubs. - wait for certification.  PA hasn’t certified either, tRump going to try same shit as in MI and their Repubs aren’t half as ethical as MI.  AZ - Maricopa Cty certifying- need State to certified.  GA only one over today.  Keep praying!
1329974087242878976 2020-11-21 10:25:06 +0800 <Skel531> @MiaDM18 Be very careful with it - just do third of pill first time, even if low dose.  I took less than 5mg first night, slept okay, not great, next day kept falling asleep, felt bad. Glad I didn’t have to drive anywhere.  Next time took 1/3 of pill, better, but still groggy entire day.
1329973130610274305 2020-11-21 10:21:18 +0800 <Skel531> @edgallekfox8 @ClevelandScene Sorry, believe that is low.  Remember, everyone resigned in City Health Dept., system overwhelmed.

1329943214606983169 2020-11-21 08:22:26 +0800 <Skel531> @donwinslow Big Congratulations.  My sister and bro-in-Law - favorite book.  Ordering now!

1329938896411635712 2020-11-21 08:05:16 +0800 <Skel531> @AriBerman I don’t trust them, there going to pull some kinda shit!
1329938326808367105 2020-11-21 08:03:00 +0800 <Skel531> @katheln2 @mmpadellan Nope needed to. Right thing to do.  Don’t mind Humanity checks, such a shitty day, forgot myself.
1329936459034484737 2020-11-21 07:55:35 +0800 <Skel531> @mmpadellan I take it back about caring - forgot about all people that this will be spread to who don’t have a choice, and people who will be infected because of no contact tracing ,etc.  So, yes I care!
1329935680340942853 2020-11-21 07:52:29 +0800 <Skel531> @katheln2 @mmpadellan Good point, I apologize.  Forgot there will be no contact tracing and staffers won’t were masks and tell others they have (exposed).
1329934946820042758 2020-11-21 07:49:34 +0800 <Skel531> @lizazzzl All my prayers are with you.

1329920239958716422 2020-11-21 06:51:08 +0800 <Skel531> @CongressmanRaja Why do you give this fool ‘air’.  We Democrats need a different strategy going forward.

1329914265764040708 2020-11-21 06:27:24 +0800 <Skel531> @grantstern @SpeakerPelosi I’m afraid it’s going to have to get bad, really, really bad on many fronts before Republicans yell Uncle.  However, America will be in shambles like never before.   Will we be able to recover?
1329911685793140737 2020-11-21 06:17:09 +0800 <Skel531> @GSlutkin @Laurie_Garrett Just so these asshats realize, there’s no vaccine that will be out in time to save you or your families from getting Covid over Thanksgiving, over Christmas, over New Year.  My heart goes out to all healthcare workers in America.  (Vaccines prevent, they don’t cure!)
1329909144258826244 2020-11-21 06:07:03 +0800 <Skel531> Crappy Journalism is correct @washingtonpost - do better for God’s sake.  Democracy is on the line, and what goes first when that’s lost?  You.
1329908219372838913 2020-11-21 06:03:22 +0800 <Skel531> @DataDrivenMD @OliviaTroye @Transition46 Nope, too much trying to appease a psychopath.  She’s a doctor, I’m sure she could diagnose crazy, just as average American did.  She can stay at CDC, but not part of Biden Covid team, sorry.
1329904649093177347 2020-11-21 05:49:11 +0800 <Skel531> @yashar Murderers.

1329902228438720514 2020-11-21 05:39:34 +0800 <Skel531> @Weinsteinlaw This is making me pretty sick!
1329901711402692616 2020-11-21 05:37:31 +0800 <Skel531> @yashar Since when is bail an option to murders?

1329867536691847170 2020-11-21 03:21:43 +0800 <Skel531> @jaketapper @kaitlancollins Man, I didn’t even have the sound on this and it was just pure snarky, mean girl crap.  What an unprofessional pissant!  Good for you Kaitie, sticking up for truth.
1329865293078913025 2020-11-21 03:12:48 +0800 <Skel531> @JoeBiden Happy Birthday Mr. President.

1329858407839522817 2020-11-21 02:45:26 +0800 <Skel531> @DavidPepper Oh holy sheit! Even the thought of Gym Jordan running for Gov. has me sick.  David, when do we start and who are your potentials?  I’m all in like I said, as long as not from Mason/Fitz group!
1329838365726945284 2020-11-21 01:25:48 +0800 <Skel531> @Laurie_Garrett I keep seeing it mentioned being used in hospitals across U.S.  So whose getting the kickback? Doctors or Hospitals?  My coin right now is on Hospitals.  Not fair when patient can’t tell you no ‘cause they have a tube down their throat.
1329835873567973377 2020-11-21 01:15:54 +0800 <Skel531> @BarackObama So great!
1329835576070180869 2020-11-21 01:14:43 +0800 <Skel531> @Laurie_Garrett Contractor from OH went to Chicago for Halloween Party - 12 guests.  All got Covid.  3 hospital - bad.  Rest still in CHI trying to recover.  Has successful business, but hands on, cost dr/meds (self-insured), cost of stay in CHI.  Cost of stupidity is getting high!

1329821227322650625 2020-11-21 00:17:42 +0800 <Skel531> “djt is a genius- that’s what the J stands for.”  Wow, wow, wow.
1329819842870992898 2020-11-21 00:12:12 +0800 <Skel531> @JohnCornyn How about passing House Bill - out there since May.  But you continue to waste taxpayers money pushing HCQ because you stockpiled, on our dime!  And how much did that sham hearing yesterday slamming one of the best Doctor’s out there @ashishkjha cost taxpayers?  Wastrel Cronyn!
1329816408604151810 2020-11-20 23:58:33 +0800 <Skel531> @Weinsteinlaw Sad that this is necessary.  Just donated again.  Hope others will join this fight for Democracy.
1329792218933161987 2020-11-20 22:22:25 +0800 <Skel531> @ClevelandScene So sad, so sorry to hear.
1329640933168734211 2020-11-20 12:21:16 +0800 <Skel531> @IlhanMN @WajahatAli Never said better.
1329639738182148097 2020-11-20 12:16:31 +0800 <Skel531> @tedlieu @JoeBiden Just learned that they could ask for another re-count before certification tomorrow. Sure hope GA does it nice and early tomorrow.
1329638881877241856 2020-11-20 12:13:07 +0800 <Skel531> @Weinsteinlaw @BarackObama @MBK_Alliance @MSNBC The young men were outstanding.  Their sense of self was great. Their acceptance of others without judgement came through strong, as did their ability to express that no one is hopeless and should be given a chance to live, learn, and not be condemned for mistakes along the way.
1329622041172070405 2020-11-20 11:06:12 +0800 <Skel531> @johnpavlovitz I’d like to revisit with @MichelleObama on this issue.  I believe even she and Barack didn’t think it would go as dark as it has.  We need to discuss what you do with out-and-out Evil.
1329618786551558145 2020-11-20 10:53:16 +0800 <Skel531> @LarrySabato Think military going to advise Secret Service, but not involved.  Statement by Gen. Milley abt Oath to Constitution was signal.  Also, comment back in June abt Colin Powell working on something with Biden.  That’s why you know who gutted Pentagon, but won’t help him.  He’s going!
1329613744779964417 2020-11-20 10:33:14 +0800 <Skel531> @dontlickchalk I’d offer to trade the buck for the hat.  Then I’d throw the hat away.  Haven’t decided if I’d do it in front of him or not.
1329567917403484166 2020-11-20 07:31:08 +0800 <Skel531> @VeePrincipal @woozleweasels @ChrisMurphyCT @GeorgeTakei Doesn’t stop you from contacting them!  They can do Press Conference or issue press release from anywhere.
1329557070526500864 2020-11-20 06:48:02 +0800 <Skel531> @ShannonFreshour No words.   Used to admire the man, shows you how little we know about people.

Could you ask them?

Inside BOEs did everything to keep things clean, separated &amp; quick.  Do you have any stats on demonstrations?  Only ones I saw were that majority wore masks, etc. &amp; that no significant spikes seen.

1327751544356413441 2020-11-15 07:13:31 +0800 <Skel531> @IlhanMN I agree.  Start with DACA - just give them all citizenship, unconditionally.   It’s not fair for them to be on a roller coaster every 4 years.  They pay taxes, run businesses, own homes, pay property taxes.  Then overhaul the system to be fair, and meet needs of asylum seekers.
1327749560723267584 2020-11-15 07:05:38 +0800 <Skel531> @PeteSouza Based on Park Service, 11K, counting themselves and MPD ho shamelessly marched with them.  So that’s like 22% more have died of Covid.

1327444681622491136 2020-11-14 10:54:09 +0800 <Skel531> @KamalaHarris I truly believe that people with private or employer insurance don’t realize that they too will be affected by the loss of protection for pre-existing conditions if the ACA is lost.  Big Time!  The only people happy are McConnell &amp; Repubs. that make $ off insurance lobbyists!

1327401099716943872 2020-11-14 08:00:58 +0800 <Skel531> This is disrespectful to people who have lost loved ones; over 10M Americans who now have pre-existing conditions; health care workers who are running on empty; and the rest of America who are not having Thanksgiving and Christmas with family.  Shame on @SpeakerPelosi   Bad Form!

Your legacy will be in KILLING Millions of Americans by this choice and not standing up to a psychopath for your own power gains.  This will be your rotten legacy that will live in infamy as you rot in Hell.

Only way you have even a slight chance is if you vote NAY for illegal SCOTUS selection and get 10 other GOP Senators to vote NAY with you.  You decide.
1320203186502774784 2020-10-25 11:19:02 +0800 <Skel531> Not 10 miles from Field Hospital State had to put up because hospitals full of Covid patients...  At least they won’t have to travel far...  Criminal Behavior.

1320172204894683137 2020-10-25 09:15:55 +0800 <Skel531> @DavidCornDC Oh, he tops this. The Wisconsin rally tonight is less than 10 miles from the field hospital that had to be setup when hospitals ran out of beds for Covid patients.  The CRUELTY is the point!

1320155470997409792 2020-10-25 08:09:26 +0800 <Skel531> #PleaseSaveTheseChildren - Hey #MAGA you okay with this?  This was done by your bastard leader and his Administration.  Cruely is the point. F**K all that great economy talk!
1320154846121570304 2020-10-25 08:06:57 +0800 <Skel531> @donwinslow Thanks Don. This is all I will be tweeting in reply to any GOP crap - it says it all.  By the way, I cried for a half hour.

1319431230950178819 2020-10-23 08:11:33 +0800 <Skel531> The GOP has been doing this for years. Thousands of hours, thousands of dollars.

Why don’t you want Americans to exercise their rights?  Why do you constantly contest, thwart, and openly commit illegal acts to keep people from Voting?

1317143590825578496 2020-10-17 00:41:18 +0800 <Skel531> @realDonaldTrump Fact Checkers conclude you are wrong O Damaged Goods.
1317143255797108741 2020-10-17 00:39:58 +0800 <Skel531> @donwinslow In Ohio it is illegal to carry a gun (open or concealed) into any goverment, school, or church building. That would cover majority of polling locations.  In addition no Poll Observer is allowed to carry a gun.  Outside the grounds of the Poll Location-call the local police.
1317110215008026625 2020-10-16 22:28:40 +0800 <Skel531> @jaketapper What a Dick!  Comment and move on @LarryHogan is a DISTRACTION, and like all the GOP a Disserver to Democracy!

1316947378658811905 2020-10-16 11:41:37 +0800 <Skel531> @DanRather This is so not right!
1316945130583109632 2020-10-16 11:32:41 +0800 <Skel531> @MichaelSteele @JoeBiden So tell me, are you all going to let the sycophants back in when you rebuild or (I’m hoping) say NOPE.

1316942390360494081 2020-10-16 11:21:48 +0800 <Skel531> @BillOReilly Well, when a credible Journalist &amp; former litigator Guthrie has to babysit a lunatic, tantrum-throwing blowhard, versus having a grown-up decent, constructive conversation with people...  Yeah sure, blame the woman for being hostile....  and you know a lot about that don’t you?

1316935484053032961 2020-10-16 10:54:21 +0800 <Skel531> @donwinslow @Twitter Yeah, I noted that when it came back suddenly ByeTiffany wasn’t even trending and it was at number 2....but the CrookedJoeBiden was still up- is still up now.  What do you think @Twitter @TwitterSafety @jack   Don’t we have a right to know?  Something is mighty squirrelly.

His claim to fame in the SCOTUS Hearings was when he talked about religion...  ‘...and a lot of religions believe a lot of weird things, like Virgin Birth..’  That must have been a big hit with Catholics!

1315851767637250048 2020-10-13 11:08:03 +0800 <Skel531> @grantstern So when Florida goes to Polls on 11/3, the armed tRump army will be meeting his supporters? That could be interesting.
1315849845622661124 2020-10-13 11:00:25 +0800 <Skel531> @ananavarro @KBirkenfeld Cruelty is the point.

1315826283121700865 2020-10-13 09:26:47 +0800 <Skel531> @RobertMaguire_ Correction, it is a Federal Holiday.  However, many city/county/state govs do not observ, they use alternate like Veterans Day, and now in Columbus OH (city), will use Nov Election Day.

For the GOP to use religion for political gain is beyond reprehensible.    Derision and Division have no place in a true religion.

1314720045755441152 2020-10-10 08:10:59 +0800 <Skel531> @RepAdamSchiff Think again. Stop treating tRump like he has an ounce of caring for anyone but himself.  When you adjust your thinking to the truth, you can play hardball with this Bully.  Diplomacy he knows not!
1314714670347976704 2020-10-10 07:49:38 +0800 <Skel531> @vanitaguptaCR So we have one choice, Vote, help everyone vote or be prepared to march like Belarus.

1314711557473959937 2020-10-10 07:37:16 +0800 <Skel531> @clairecmc @chrislhayes @allinwithchris You might suggest that MSM and Journalists really stop softballing these people when they agree to come on their shows (I.e., Hallie Jackson w/Ted Cruz this a.m.)  If they lie, they need to be shut down!
1314709254629142533 2020-10-10 07:28:07 +0800 <Skel531> Just think about it 👇
1314708977779961856 2020-10-10 07:27:01 +0800 <Skel531> @Twitter @jack - really, this is wrong. You need to take this down. Even the SOS came out and said it was an error they corrected.  Please take action NOW!  Thank you.

When they try and deny us our right to vote...we say ‘I’ll show you’!  Why don’t they want people to vote? - only question you need to ask people.
1314671115290247170 2020-10-10 04:56:33 +0800 <Skel531> @DrPhilGoff Please tell me you report this kind of crap.

Very reckless, especially after tRump recondemned her tonight and there are thousands of these Domestic Terrorist Malitias in America.  Like FBI said it only takes one miss!

1312526468878987265 2020-10-04 06:54:30 +0800 <Skel531> @AnaCabrera @DanaBashCNN Spin, spin, spin....  GOP are the antithesis of Lie, Lie, Lie.  And that’s why they are all complicit in the death of 215K who  Died, Died, Died.
1312524007523053570 2020-10-04 06:44:43 +0800 <Skel531> @AndrewFeinberg Could it be that no one at the WH knows what an anesthesiologist does?  That would be my take!

1312514631739473920 2020-10-04 06:07:28 +0800 <Skel531> Hey @FBI , there right around the corner.  Are you going to do anything.  I believe it’s not legal to have guns in front of a Military Installation.

If Jake is referring to tRump, his Administration &amp; entire GOP, then say so, because they were &amp; still are unwilling &amp; unable to control. Brazenly.

1311847336268697601 2020-10-02 09:55:52 +0800 <Skel531> @girlsreallyrule Thanks for the important update!  So much for the river in MN, that turned into a ditch in WI, that turned into NO ballots.
1311842326139015170 2020-10-02 09:35:58 +0800 <Skel531> @DerekCressman 🚨ALERT  I’m watching @maddow right now and it’s not over yet.  If you know anyone in PA, get them on the phone and tell them what’s going on and call their State legislators and say NO to this BS plan!
1311840605862060032 2020-10-02 09:29:07 +0800 <Skel531> This is where everyone’s focus needs to be - @JoeBiden knows, joe knows.. . No more DISTRACTIONS - okay their racist, their deplorable, but their killing us.  This is what we need to concentrate on👇
1311837750275059722 2020-10-02 09:17:47 +0800 <Skel531> @meiselasb So, can we pump Covid and it’s fallout with food, family, jobs, businesses, etc?  Covid issues are our strongest card to win the election for @JoeBiden   Supreme Court pick would be #2.  Polls are dropping, not much time.  Careful of staying on DISTRACTIONS for too long.  thanks

1311315178470940672 2020-09-30 22:41:16 +0800 <Skel531> @VABVOX @unique2be Wow, same thought we had👇 Thanks for your great thread.   https://t.co/0w4Ff99Ow8
1311314429624160258 2020-09-30 22:38:17 +0800 <Skel531> @ClevelandScene I never thought I’d say cell phones are a good thing, but now they are completely redeemed in my mind.  These little devices have exposed the underbelly of what is wrong with America, which is hard to believe, but necessary, if we are to move forward with integrity as a society.
1311186149420007426 2020-09-30 14:08:33 +0800 <Skel531> @donwinslow @waltshaub   I think I figured it out 👇
1311185868955308032 2020-09-30 14:07:26 +0800 <Skel531> Last Thought.  tRump is in an International Pedophile Ring.  Following that will lead you to big $   Big $ was needed to impress Ps - lead him to Putin  Putin exploits/blackmails for own purposes w/$ and tapes  all else follows w/Putin Instructing  Voting in # our only salvation!

1311182436676571137 2020-09-30 13:53:48 +0800 <Skel531> @JoeNBC I want you to book him on your show for 8am tomorrow morning.  Why, every time tRump cut into Biden’s time or answer, did Wallace let tRump continue his rant and not go back and let Biden finish his answer?  I call BULLSHIT, he stinks as a moderator from a Propaganda Outlet!
1311181560012574721 2020-09-30 13:50:19 +0800 <Skel531> @Jillbiden46 @JoeBiden Very Proud.
1311180369815842816 2020-09-30 13:45:35 +0800 <Skel531> @Twitter @TwitterSupport @jack NEEDS TO TAKE DOWN EVERY ONE OF THEIR FEEDS - PERMANENTLY.  THEY ARE INCITING VIOLENCE.  AND TAKE DOWN tRUMP also.  HE’s INCITING CIVIL WAR!
1311178756795650050 2020-09-30 13:39:10 +0800 <Skel531> @wiczipedia Agreed, worked enough Polls to know each party gets maybe 1 Observer - each Poll location, who is pre-approved by the party and BOE with set rules of conduct, must check in/out w/poll supervisor, etc.  This is the thread of what really happened in Philly.   https://t.co/nksPeY1xeU
1311176488948035584 2020-09-30 13:30:10 +0800 <Skel531> @AlexBNewhouse @GlennKesslerWP They already have backpacks and shit printed with those words.
1311175407589351424 2020-09-30 13:25:52 +0800 <Skel531> America is being Bullied by tRump and the GOP.  How do you handle a Bully?  and👇
1311174489636569088 2020-09-30 13:22:13 +0800 <Skel531> @Kasparov63 @anneapplebaum My hubby and I were trying to figure it out - he got it in a nutshell.  tRump supporters are like people in an abussive relationship who don’t realize that what is happening to them is wrong, and won’t leave their abuser.  We need abuse councilors to guide them out of mayhem.
1311170763668549634 2020-09-30 13:07:25 +0800 <Skel531> @RandyRainbow What did he say, ‘cause I can’t break my vow of never listening to him!
1311170016360964097 2020-09-30 13:04:26 +0800 <Skel531> @karenkasler @ClevelandScene @SpeakerCupp She’s as F**ked up as DeWine.  Turn Blue Ohio before it’s too late, the GOP supports White Supremacists, disrespects the Rule of Law, and help needlessly kill 210K Americans.
1311168676507324419 2020-09-30 12:59:07 +0800 <Skel531> @Weinsteinlaw @donwinslow @JoeBiden @BarackObama @KamalaHarris Done for 2nd time today.  And to downticket blue candidates all over U.S.
1311166750034141184 2020-09-30 12:51:28 +0800 <Skel531> Okay. We know tRump &amp; followers are lunatics &amp; will say bad things about @joeBiden and others.  I’m begging with you to ignore them instead of giving into their DISTRACTION and BAITING.  We have important work to do quickly to get every VOTE out as early as possible for BlueWave!
1311161464938520578 2020-09-30 12:30:28 +0800 <Skel531> @waltshaub Baileys in coffee is great.  Without it I would have gone screaming into the street!

1311147551865876482 2020-09-30 11:35:10 +0800 <Skel531> @AriBerman @GlennKesslerWP No, I can prove everything tRump said was a Lie.
1311145587778228225 2020-09-30 11:27:22 +0800 <Skel531> We’re with you 100% Joe.  BLUE WAVE 2020.  The GOP DOESNT EXIST ANYMORE.
1311145034058731528 2020-09-30 11:25:10 +0800 <Skel531> Hey OHIO, this is the most disgusting thing ever. 👇
1311144742412079104 2020-09-30 11:24:01 +0800 <Skel531> @MikeDeWine You have got to be kidding!  I now have lost the last modicum of respect I had for you.  You call that ranting, rude, interrupting, logorrhea from tRump Good?  What’s wrong with you man, have you no sense of decency- he embarrassed us to the World!  Shame on you!
1311143504031223808 2020-09-30 11:19:05 +0800 <Skel531> @brikeilarcnn @RickSantorum Bri- it should have been YOU on @CNN   van Jones sucks and is a traitor to his race and America and Rick Santorum is not a journalist or an expert on anything.  Sadly, I bet CNNs ratings tanked, just like ABC.
1311142492562165761 2020-09-30 11:15:04 +0800 <Skel531> @girlsreallyrule 👍  Thank god I put Baileys in my coffee or I would have been screaming on the front porch.

1311132784799477760 2020-09-30 10:36:30 +0800 <Skel531> Jesus, it’s like I’m at a family dinner with all 11 of my siblings talking at the same time.  I can’t stand the noise!  CHRIS WALLACE SUCKS!
1311130304501997569 2020-09-30 10:26:38 +0800 <Skel531> Why does that POS Chris Wallace when tRump interrupts on Biden’s time let tRump finish his rant and Biden loses his time?
1311128218280374272 2020-09-30 10:18:21 +0800 <Skel531> It’s like Rudy is up there drunk.  Man Chris Wallace is a POS!

What a joke, but it’s easy for that phony Christie - everything is ‘Fake News’.  and another major network falls for tRumpism crap.  Thank God for MSNBC.
1311101756454117376 2020-09-30 08:33:12 +0800 <Skel531> @TheRickyDavila Not really, the debate site is surrounded by national guard trucks and mounted police, but this is near enough.

1311098387639525377 2020-09-30 08:19:49 +0800 <Skel531> @grynbaum @Lawrence @ABC That makes me laugh.  Sorry I watch @MSNBC exclusively except when Chris Todd is on, then I watch @brikeilarcnn on CNN.

1311096394384637953 2020-09-30 08:11:54 +0800 <Skel531> @girlsreallyrule But, there is nothing to stop Joe Biden from mentioning the 210K.

1311082724413911040 2020-09-30 07:17:34 +0800 <Skel531> @donwinslow I know, I thought that would turn them, maybe food pantry lines and homeless will do it.  I’ll never forget that guy at the Tulsa rally when asked abt Covid saying ‘we’ll, my neighbor and his little daughter died, but I didn’t know them, so....’
1311081005852356608 2020-09-30 07:10:45 +0800 <Skel531> I’m lying &amp; sending this out hours before the debate hoping you won’t watch me make a true asshat of myself.  That way you’ll still vote w/out knowing 210K people died f/Covid,  &amp; your a sucker/loser ‘cause I only pay $750 in INCOME Tax and steal from you. @realdonaldtrump

1310600610971095041 2020-09-28 23:21:50 +0800 <Skel531> @MeidasTouch As we all know from @Lawrence   Notice how they don’t say ‘INCOME TAXES’.  That’s what we’re talking about here.  There is no such thing as ‘Personal Taxes’.  All the other Taxes these people mention are part of the cost of doing business and not part of the discussion.
1310599089885769729 2020-09-28 23:15:47 +0800 <Skel531> @realDonaldTrump Because you say so?  PROVE IT.  You are truly Damaged Goods.

1310574957957656576 2020-09-28 21:39:53 +0800 <Skel531> @girlsreallyrule I peaked at their video.  They had a bunch of sealed envelopes on dashboard of car driving down the road.  The GOP Cult will never question the fact that the envelopes were the wrong size and completely blank on outside.  So sad.
1310573670314790914 2020-09-28 21:34:46 +0800 <Skel531> @girlsreallyrule Do you think the essentially ‘broke’ RNC will come after the likes of him?

It exposes how little they pay in taxes - bad, get rid of him and lay low.  It exposes how little they pay in taxes - must keep him in office.

1309623081330245632 2020-09-26 06:37:28 +0800 <Skel531> @girlsreallyrule The Catholic Group she is in was Condemned by Pope John Paul in 90s.  They have extreme priests, Latin Masses, and the wife is to stay home - like in 1950s, they are not allowed in reg. churches.  I’m surprised she has a job.  Separation of Church/State (NOT).
1309621296272150529 2020-09-26 06:30:23 +0800 <Skel531> @soledadobrien So, easy to fix ... everyone stop tweeting and retweeting anything from these asshats.
1309620690212081665 2020-09-26 06:27:58 +0800 <Skel531> @chrislhayes Sorry, not trusting the number (would like to but can’t).  The sources I use suddenly stop reporting 2 days ago, all I can get are trends.  They’re messing with the numbers.

1309618465196695557 2020-09-26 06:19:08 +0800 <Skel531> @Renew_Democracy @MaxBoot Problem is, he won’t respect it, he respects nothing.
1309618105572823040 2020-09-26 06:17:42 +0800 <Skel531> @ReallyAmerican1 1️⃣They were from PRIMARY 2️⃣as of 9/17, PA has not mailed out Ballots yet for General 3️⃣we’re not in ditch, in dumpster, by Temp employee - now gone!  This was a DISTRACTION.  Pass it on &amp; Vote, help others Vote.
1309617314560643074 2020-09-26 06:14:33 +0800 <Skel531> @PPact Dem Senate can hold off the vote until after election, 2 Senate seats could be immed. occupied by Dems &amp; that could change vote.  Support @CaptMarkKelly @ReverendWarnock   @SpeakerPelosi can start impeachment for Treason on tRump.. All other bus. in both houses stops.
1309613952310153220 2020-09-26 06:01:12 +0800 <Skel531> @billscher He understands, but he knows they’ll do it anyhow.
1309613658633314304 2020-09-26 06:00:02 +0800 <Skel531> @brianschatz @maddow Hold the floor until after the election. Then there’s a good chance the GOP won’t have the votes, i.e., Mark Kelly and 1 other seat right away.
1309612751971659777 2020-09-26 05:56:26 +0800 <Skel531> @maddow and the Governor will lie again, call this chart a lie, say hospitals are empty like DeathSantis, and shoot another bird.
1309612356813684737 2020-09-26 05:54:51 +0800 <Skel531> @SenateDems @SenSherrodBrown Hold the floor. Don’t let it proceed.
1309612065833848833 2020-09-26 05:53:42 +0800 <Skel531> @fred_guttenberg @JoeBiden We need to push @SpeakerPelosi to impeach Barr or tRump again. Once she announces, nothing can go forward in house or senate until after all hearings.
1309611565843468291 2020-09-26 05:51:43 +0800 <Skel531> @donwinslow If he says anything, he’ll say ‘people’.

1309601523073249292 2020-09-26 05:11:48 +0800 <Skel531> @donwinslow Also, they were from the PRIMARY.  As of Sept 17, PA has not yet mailed General Election Ballots to anyone.  Scam, double scam.  and PA said that it was the fault of a Temp employee who has been dismissed.
1309600660770488322 2020-09-26 05:08:23 +0800 <Skel531> @SenSherrodBrown - I trust you will vote NO to any SCOTUS candidate put forward before the election if it comes to a vote.  Would be nice to see it in writing.  Thank you.

1309567856842072065 2020-09-26 02:58:02 +0800 <Skel531> @maddow @pbump Could you all point out that the PA Seven Ballot Scandal was for PRIMARY ballots?  To not say so is very miss-leading.  PA has still not mailed out their General Election ballots -per 9/17/20 - order.
1309535546235064322 2020-09-26 00:49:38 +0800 <Skel531> @EricTrump Fred, it’s been debunked as BUNK days ago.  What, you just wake up at 3-day Coke binge?  Great way to prep for next Tuesday when you get your ass handed to you and your scum family in NY.  Do another line and STFO.

1309527958663688192 2020-09-26 00:19:29 +0800 <Skel531> @girlsreallyrule Also, very few are pointing out these are from the PRIMARY.  PA HAS NOT mailed out General Election Ballots yet. (Last writeup on this was 9/17/20 that says no County has permission to mail yet.  These things NEED to be pointed out.

When are States like Virginia @GovernorVA going to realize how much money this will actually cost them in the long run.  Money that the Feds are not giving the States for  Covid.  Don’t be Bullied!

1309286982057635841 2020-09-25 08:21:56 +0800 <Skel531> @KrisRuffo @AdamParkhomenko So how much is 200 going to help? And for how long?

There are groups of Catholics so right-type extreme that even Pope John Paul condemned them back in the 80-90s.  I know some of them. They do not mix with regular congregations. Separate services in Latin and wives believe they need to be 1950s housewives, etc.
1309269171897806848 2020-09-25 07:11:10 +0800 <Skel531> @JoyAnnReid just said what we’re all thinking.  The GOP Senate cannot be trusted even though they said they would accept the outcome of vote and uphold the Constitution.

1308828543581933574 2020-09-24 02:00:16 +0800 <Skel531> @BarbMcQuade Broken bullshit, over, and over, and over again.  Same crap with Tamir Rice.  It also speaks to Prosecutors and State AGs having no backbone to do the hard work and passing the buck to BS Grand Juries.
1308826140421873664 2020-09-24 01:50:43 +0800 <Skel531> @MSNBC your loss of audio and loss of picture at critical moments today is disturbing.  Not the first time.

It is not TikToks responsibility, and no one wants them teaching any American History  He is trying to undermine the teaching of 1619 Project and true history of Slavery and Racism in American History.

Then, in my own town, I saw people yelling/cursing at people they deemed ‘Muslim’.  It ripped opened the wound of 9/11, every time.

1304438680656982019 2020-09-11 23:16:31 +0800 <Skel531> @AmyMcGrathKY @mmpadellan I remember silence, even the birds had stopped singing.  The memory that plays over in my mind - an F-18 piercing that silence, on its way to PA.  I realized then why my Dad had to go fly in WWII,  &amp; renewed my vow to always support our Military, Democracy, our Country.

On Labor Day?  nothing about the front line workers, or labor in America, or how it’s the backbone of America.  Guess you have to have a backbone to recognize it in others.

He couldn’t see who fired because suddenly there was tear gas in the air.  Who had tear-gas?  I know it wasn’t Protesters.
1301267911038898176 2020-09-03 05:17:01 +0800 <Skel531> @maddow When will someone yell ‘the emperor has no clothes’?  No one.   Wonder why?  He’s prostituted and destroyed every area of Government.  tRump/Putin’s New World Order Plan will make every Democide, Genocide, and Holocaust in the history of man, look like child’s play.

Are they building a ‘secret army’?  There are good cops and bad.  With the call for police reform, the bad, backed by White Supremacist-leaning Unions, fight change.  https://t.co/YpApXRRjQU

Do you ever wonder if people are contacting their GOP Legislators and expressing concern?    Notice how quiet majority GOP Legislstors are right now?  Lemmings headed for deep water.

The third man lost his arm. Has any journalist contacted him or his family?  Has any journalist spent much time trying to contact the families of or comment on the 2 men who were killed?
