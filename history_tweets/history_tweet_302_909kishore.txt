His supporters will think it‚Äôs a conspiracy and take actions. The US will be even more vulnerable. We don‚Äôt need more chaos right now.
1311912463663800321 2020-10-02 14:14:40 +0800 <909kishore> ABC News is saying no one on Air Force One wears masks except the press :(  I guess epidemiologists will have a solid case study of how Covid may spread on planes soon.
1311903244474617856 2020-10-02 13:38:02 +0800 <909kishore> Remember when 15 people had Covid and it was going to ‚Äújust disappear‚Äù ?    7 months later...

1310991385525354498 2020-09-30 01:14:38 +0800 <909kishore> Instagram just added hair segmentation and a bunch of Creators are rolling out new filters to take advantage of it. Here‚Äôs a nice simple one you can try:  https://t.co/dI9cHk3FdK  #AugmentedReality  https://t.co/X9EoQJpXmH
1310982749063438340 2020-09-30 00:40:18 +0800 <909kishore> Perhaps this was a large part of Facebook‚Äôs motivation to unify Facebook and Oculus logins. Anyone who bought a game on Oculus has their credit card payment stored and can soon easily buy stuff on Instagram with that stored credit card.
