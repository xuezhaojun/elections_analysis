Two of those people died the ending of March because we were never told the truth about this virus.  He knew how deadly it was and that is was transmitted through the air and kept silent

1337083590962782209 2020-12-11 01:15:44 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Jim_Jordan Again, Hunter Biden is not our president.  Besides, please explain how it is ok for Diaper Don's kids to steal from a children's cancer charity?

1337070380205404164 2020-12-11 00:23:14 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DianeBernaerts Let's see.  I tweeted on his post and I am pretty sure he will block me too.  He is an idiot who is promoting the death cult.  Makes me sick.
1337070144275746824 2020-12-11 00:22:18 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @SebGorka The souls who have died with covid are not the winners and yet their deaths or the suffering of their families are never mentioned.  It is all about him and we all know it.

1337028359222685696 2020-12-10 21:36:16 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @GeraldoRivera Gerry, I thought your pal Diaper Donnie said we wee rounding the corner and the number of deaths were very low??  You should separate yourself now from him and redeem yourself if you want to save any kind of career you have.
1337025773971103746 2020-12-10 21:25:59 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @GeraldoRivera @JoeBiden Gerry, think before your speak. First , he isn't our president.  Second, let's not forget diaper Don's kids.  You remember the charity for cancer incident?  SDNY is going to have a field day with the little brats and many, many of us can not wait.  Long time coming.

We are on Staten Island and it seems as thought those Proud Boys are here and starting major shit along with the rest of the tRupsters.  My son and I are stuck in here indefinitely.  This sucks for those of us who are responsible.

He when he was backed into a corner and on his lie about knowing he said he did not want to cause panic.  Bullshit, he knew it was transmitted through the air and deadly and he should have told us to wear a fucking mask.
1333942019287343106 2020-12-02 09:12:15 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @hashesofbarger When he bragged that he can grab woman by the p#$%y was that religious??  Is his 26 sexual assaults religious???  Not only is not religious but it is also threatening.  Keep giving him more money you are fools.
1333934566252351489 2020-12-02 08:42:38 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Aimushroamer It doesn't surprise me in the least.  I wonder what they will call their new cult??
1333874828668002310 2020-12-02 04:45:16 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @GretaKae I kind of liked that one  a real lot.
1333874605182869506 2020-12-02 04:44:22 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Ladybellesfic Happy birthday!
1333851099237920768 2020-12-02 03:10:58 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @seanhannity Fuck the hat.  What about all the people who suffered and died from covid.  I am going to make sure anyone I know that watches you boycotts you now.
1333850194803351555 2020-12-02 03:07:22 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr What about a moral obligation on not lying to us about covid like daddy did
1333848433975844866 2020-12-02 03:00:23 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @MarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump We won't forget how you left us all to die either, asshole.
1333847986657513472 2020-12-02 02:58:36 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Megawatts55 @fuckcancer56 I it like pre-ordering XBox to them.
1333847625360171009 2020-12-02 02:57:10 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Bill_Maxwell_ Dirty diapers.
1333843803216744449 2020-12-02 02:41:58 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @dukewindsor388 Kind of like the last 4 years for America
1333842760743399429 2020-12-02 02:37:50 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr You and your family are human excrement.
1333842148043657216 2020-12-02 02:35:24 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @ResisterDude I am too much a lady to answer, but that was a great question.
1333841628646285318 2020-12-02 02:33:20 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TomiLahren Please give me your version of "socialism".  This should be a good one.
1333839784712810497 2020-12-02 02:26:00 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realTuckFrumper I want whatever they are taking
1333833778607886338 2020-12-02 02:02:08 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @RexChapman Many, many, many stupid and selfish out there.  Mind blowing that a moron like tRump could convince so many people into joining a death cult.
1333832039926288385 2020-12-02 01:55:14 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @lanechanged @DeVos1990 That was a good one!!!  Cracking up!!!
1333831863387951106 2020-12-02 01:54:32 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @GeraBadillo @DonaldJTrumpJr No one likes to lose, but my goodness what sore losers.
1333831565953167363 2020-12-02 01:53:21 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @CitizenMom1996 @DonaldJTrumpJr I guess all his followers think all the news media, doctors and nurses are in on this "plot".  Sickening.
1333831078373683203 2020-12-02 01:51:25 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @CitizenMom1996 @DonaldJTrumpJr Makes me so angry.  Even if I supported someone I would still do research and question things.  I can not associate with anyone who supports him anymore.  It is a matter or life or death for my family
1333830604333469701 2020-12-02 01:49:32 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @CitizenMom1996 @DonaldJTrumpJr I am on Staten Island and most insist this virus is made to look deadly by the liberal media.  Seriously want to move out of here.
1333829885824036866 2020-12-02 01:46:40 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @arnet_nichol @ManosPaulette @DonaldJTrumpJr Thank you.  I thought I was nuts.  I never knew how many insane and irrational people there were  before this virus.
1333815682434297856 2020-12-02 00:50:14 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @santiagomayer_ No!!!   Can this year get any stranger!!!
1333814991728861184 2020-12-02 00:47:29 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @ProjectLincoln You guys are the best!!!
1333803769742684165 2020-12-02 00:02:54 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @chipfranklin He terrifies me and angers me to get passed that.
1333802419629670405 2020-12-01 23:57:32 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> Qanon person actually told me that coivd helps cure cancer and hear disease.  I thought it was a joke at first.   Chilling!!
1333800630637400065 2020-12-01 23:50:25 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @AlRenshaw3 @DonaldJTrumpJr I am a nurse but I guess you know better.   Let me know how you it goes when you get covid.  Take care
1333797931980185600 2020-12-01 23:39:42 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @dagerc08 @DonaldJTrumpJr What ??? People  wanting a heads up about a deadly virus makes them dumb founded?
1333797400754851852 2020-12-01 23:37:35 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @RVing2016 @DonaldJTrumpJr He knew this was deadly and transmitted through the air and could have at least told us to wear a fucking mask!  He made fun of masks and downplayed this virus and played into delusional people's minds.  By delusional person.
1333796450799554562 2020-12-01 23:33:49 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @ManosPaulette @DonaldJTrumpJr He knew months ahead of us that this was deadly and transmitted through the air.   He could have at least told us to wear a fucking mask. This could have been avoided.  This did not have to be.  Take it easy delusional person
1333790136702619654 2020-12-01 23:08:43 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @CliffW08950229 Stunning. Also, you would think that they should be worried about the virus instead of being petty.  Oh, wait they are not concerned about our lives and don't care how many have died and suffered.
1333788231465201665 2020-12-01 23:01:09 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @grantstern @BrianKarem She will be gone soon and hopefully she will start her community service on the side of a major freeway when an oil tanker looses control.
1333782397863735297 2020-12-01 22:37:58 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @EthanRa74405057 @DonaldJTrumpJr The grift that keeps on grifting...
1333768624847327233 2020-12-01 21:43:15 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @yogi35898 @ShaneGoldmacher I agree.  Grifting has a nice ring to it.
1333767567396265984 2020-12-01 21:39:02 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Strandjunker No doubt in my mind.  They are sick POS!
1333759298984349697 2020-12-01 21:06:11 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @PBarnabyG @BillTzamaras I second the weight watchers.
1333758863561158656 2020-12-01 21:04:27 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @BillTzamaras He needs a striaght jacket
1333756406646902786 2020-12-01 20:54:41 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @phon_zone @DonaldJTrumpJr He knew the virus was deadly and was transmitted through the air and never told us.  If we fucking knew about this fucking virus then I am sure we would have thought for our fucking selves.  Can't argue with thick heads who are fucking stupid
1333755005598220289 2020-12-01 20:49:07 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @AHappyHourHero Agreed!
1333680580173631488 2020-12-01 15:53:23 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Myrddn @DougAndres @JohnCornyn It is sickening and chilling
1333680185019863041 2020-12-01 15:51:49 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DeVos1990 @ResistProfessor I have wood and brass also.  Love the sound although my neighbor complains at times.
1333676394811977729 2020-12-01 15:36:45 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @KaybeAway I am so sorry.  It is good to vent because he has harmed and ruined so many lives and it is very traumatic.
1333623196147462146 2020-12-01 12:05:22 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @faridghalili No, I couldn't
1333622443961880577 2020-12-01 12:02:22 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @shannonrwatts You are not alone in this.  We are in this together.
1333620759579725826 2020-12-01 11:55:41 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @cl1ppr @DonaldJTrumpJr Trump was our president and we were under his watch.  Bottom line.  Did you listen to the Woodward recordings//  I suggest you do your fact checking.
1333620042802589696 2020-12-01 11:52:50 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @LauraP_Love @cl1ppr @DonaldJTrumpJr He is a stable genius just like his dad.
1333604660222054400 2020-12-01 10:51:42 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr What did daddy do Junior when he found out about this deadly virus???  Oh, wait I know he kept it from us and lied and still lies to us.
1333599288211988481 2020-12-01 10:30:22 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @grantstern Those Twitter rants are getting old.  They need to sticky glue his fingers together.
1333598730872877057 2020-12-01 10:28:09 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @SweetFnLucifer Just laughed so a big thank you!!!  They will be gone soon!
1333590066611032065 2020-12-01 09:53:43 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TheRickWilson @JoeyGomezSantos @Mediaite Rick, I have been with Project Lincoln for a while now and I have been called a "Fucking Jane Fonda traitor" because I am brainwashed by the evil "Project Lincoln Foundation".
1333588225659711490 2020-12-01 09:46:24 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @FrankFigliuzzi1 @GablerStan How they all keep getting away with this criminal behavior is disgusting.
1333587923967602695 2020-12-01 09:45:12 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @pozvibes4u Praying for you

1333542446282797064 2020-12-01 06:44:29 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @classicalricky Ingest disinfectant.
1333542225360392193 2020-12-01 06:43:37 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @AdmiralGou @kenolin1 @realDonaldTrump Still the fool will be screaming.  Hopefully this time in a mental institution.
1333539204710723589 2020-12-01 06:31:37 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Fran79434361 You are not alone.
1333538991883374594 2020-12-01 06:30:46 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TheRickWilson Again!!! Thanks, Rick.  Everyday I hope we can all breathe a little easier.
1333538320824086528 2020-12-01 06:28:06 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TheRickWilson @LetsTurnFLBlue @thedailybeast So many suffered and it didn't have to be that way.  This  is something many of us will never, never forget.
1333537352560545794 2020-12-01 06:24:15 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @LSD122070 All kidding aside this has been hell for everyone.  Tough times.
1333520443718897667 2020-12-01 05:17:04 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @EricTrump Another grift so soon???  Maybe daddy can advertise for Depends.
1333519293514911745 2020-12-01 05:12:29 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @LSD122070 I usually hide my computer too.  I still manage to get into trouble though.
1333514625514672128 2020-12-01 04:53:56 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @LSD122070 Same here.  When I drink I must hide my phone.
1333503884954902533 2020-12-01 04:11:16 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @LeftofLeftEye We have to be very careful.
1333482263238078464 2020-12-01 02:45:21 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @CliffW08950229 Praying that he will be.
1333480346621501440 2020-12-01 02:37:44 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> If only thick headed conspiracy believers would listen.  Many I know on  Staten Island still think that this virus is bullshit and it is sickening.
1333478629599272962 2020-12-01 02:30:54 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @B52Malmet Also a leader who can actually read.
1333478512444010496 2020-12-01 02:30:26 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @mmpadellan Yes, I was relieved to learn that Joe Biden really can read.  It is really refreshing.
1333344123735191554 2020-11-30 17:36:26 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @EricTrump Yes, because Joe Biden is smart and compassionate which are qualities that you father lacks.
1333289383630430208 2020-11-30 13:58:55 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JennaEllisEsq Maybe it is the smell of tRump's diaper
1333256214017437697 2020-11-30 11:47:06 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @AndyOstroy Deadly
1333255615553155078 2020-11-30 11:44:44 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @AdamParkhomenko Thank goodness he didn't hurt his foot slipping on Donnie's dirty Diaper.  Donnie diaper needs to go!!!
1333235258939105280 2020-11-30 10:23:50 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @VickyisGrateful That whole team's idea of friendship bracelets it seems are ankle monitors.
1333233826336829440 2020-11-30 10:18:09 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JennaEllisEsq That is because the only thing he would slip on is ketchup from his cheeseburger.
1333230510840143874 2020-11-30 10:04:58 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @CliffW08950229 @kkreitman Thank goodness there were some people that realized he was trying to kill them.
1333228911640055808 2020-11-30 09:58:37 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @WalshFreedom I hear that from his supporters too.  He is a coward who hides in his bunker.
1333206566271594498 2020-11-30 08:29:49 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @pozvibes4u Prayers to your family and your community.
1333204362114555905 2020-11-30 08:21:04 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JennaEllisEsq How many times did you have to spell check America before you got it right??
1333203639658307590 2020-11-30 08:18:12 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Julius_Kim American lives.
1333202685051465730 2020-11-30 08:14:24 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @VickyisGrateful This is such a hard time.  So sorry that you can not see your grand children.
1333190333258194947 2020-11-30 07:25:19 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @blakecouch @GeoffRBennett @gtconway3d I think we may be able to be proud to be American again.
1333189460142542853 2020-11-30 07:21:51 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @koolkaryn I can not stop laughing.  This guy is bonkers.
1333188740009910272 2020-11-30 07:18:59 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @dontlickchalk @camoxendale Great idea!!!
1333186475333214208 2020-11-30 07:09:59 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @GeoffRBennett @gtconway3d What???  People with actual educations who don't have to wear ankle bracelets???
1333185993625759750 2020-11-30 07:08:04 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @ejeancarroll @donwinslow @realDonaldTrump You are inspiring!!!
1333182784794484736 2020-11-30 06:55:19 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @mmpadellan I am going to use that phrase.  You summed it up perfectly.
1333181006644473857 2020-11-30 06:48:15 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Angry_Staffer @TheAdvocate2020 He is completely insane and now anyone who still supports I stay very far from because they are also insane.
1333179707517521921 2020-11-30 06:43:06 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @fuckcancer56 The sick part of this is people still worship him.  That scares the hell out of me.
1333178433879363584 2020-11-30 06:38:02 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @fuckcancer56 Yes!!!  It was like a burning oil tanker truck crashing into a nuclear power plant!!

1333115065214660614 2020-11-30 02:26:14 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @PalmerReport I needed that laugh, thank you!!!  Hopefully we can all start laughing a little more and start to heal after these last horrific 4 years!!

1332797420334411782 2020-11-29 05:24:01 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @atrupar After Giuliani and co. made fools of themselves and we laughed the tRump supporters that I know are certain tRump will serve another 4 years.  So I laughed more.
1332796216837615620 2020-11-29 05:19:14 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DrjimPhifer I am sorry.  Praying for your family.

1332686465252331522 2020-11-28 22:03:08 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @EricTrump Yes, because Joe Biden did the right thing and did not have super spreader rallies and respected human life.  Most of us with common sense knew exposing people to the virus for and ego trip is just deranged.

She along a Jeremy Herrell  who it seems has a podcast are trying to get people to gear up and rally up for Georgia.  Do I take this serious?

1332465829036830722 2020-11-28 07:26:24 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Tdwhy1 All we do here is stay in our pjs and eat.  When this is all over I will need an intervention
1332459943560159233 2020-11-28 07:03:01 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @ksorbs I am a Republican but when a man brags about grabbing woman by their p$%%y, lies to us about a deadly pandemic (ant his is all for starters) I know e is not a man of good moral fiber.  If you condone that disgusting behavior then that is on you buddy.
1332403910498283526 2020-11-28 03:20:21 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump Thank you!!!  I needed this today!
1332402346018672642 2020-11-28 03:14:08 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @B52Malmet These jerks are so exhausting
1332401614871818244 2020-11-28 03:11:14 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @REDGRRRL1 I actually lost my partner of 8 years.  This whole thing is so insane.  I would watch  documentaries on Jonestown or Heaven's Gate but now I feel like I am living it.  I am sorry about your parents.
1332384412982456321 2020-11-28 02:02:53 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @B52Malmet @ABC Everyday more terrible news comes out.  When are we going to all wake up from this nightmare?

1332371700105809920 2020-11-28 01:12:22 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @donwinslow When the hell is  this tornado going to stop???
1332371195640033282 2020-11-28 01:10:21 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> DiaperDon's meltdown have my teenage son in stitches because he is such a moron.
1332370723617247234 2020-11-28 01:08:29 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @BMeiselas You guys are doing great things!!
1332370151614898176 2020-11-28 01:06:13 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @B52Malmet Very bad gene pool.
1332369748286435333 2020-11-28 01:04:36 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @hugoandalice I did go off the deep end the other night.  A family member laughed at me because I have my son learn remotely and they said I am holding him hostage and stopping him from living his childhood.
1332339335052619776 2020-11-27 23:03:45 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @kylegriffin1 He is surely going to have a nervous breakdown now.
1332332113711009792 2020-11-27 22:35:04 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @lynnemurphy1 @briantylercohen @realDonaldTrump I think he may have soiled it.
1332331427938136070 2020-11-27 22:32:20 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @burton6361 @realDonaldTrump I can't stop laughing.  Thank you!!  It has been a long 8 months!
1332329049453195267 2020-11-27 22:22:53 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @BaddCompani That blew my mind.  Even the Pope isn't  having none of their bullshit.
1332328525035171840 2020-11-27 22:20:48 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @KylaInTheBurgh The most ridiculous thing is that tRump pissed off even the Pope.  It seems the Pope isn't having any of his bullshit and urged people to follow science.
1332322791086043137 2020-11-27 21:58:01 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump And the Pope thinks you are a dick for doing this.  You know you are pretty bad when you have pissed off the Pope!!!
1332322148174749698 2020-11-27 21:55:28 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump No one likes you.  Get over it.
1332319576382640128 2020-11-27 21:45:14 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @RepsForBiden Praying that idiot doesn't do anything outlandish today.  We need at least one day of peace from Donnie Diapers.
1332311522891206657 2020-11-27 21:13:14 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @KoltchakAlex There is always some new and ridiculous way he will degrade himself.
1332309412879405056 2020-11-27 21:04:51 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @archer_rs @SusanRow91249 Same here.  I never was much into politics but this was so alarming my teen son and I both became very involved into getting as many people to vote as possible.  I will never take my freedom for granted ever again.
1332302043961290756 2020-11-27 20:35:34 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @atrupar You missed a good night.  Many laughs.
1332300624457854976 2020-11-27 20:29:56 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @respectLost58 @ImSoConfused225 Love it!!!  My teen son and I have been in lock down since this started and this will be a great stress reliever.  Thank you!
1332298874308980736 2020-11-27 20:22:59 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @ImSoConfused225 I hope you did get some laughs.  This is my place to go to also because people can be very witty and very kind.  Please get better soon.
1332282191057997825 2020-11-27 19:16:41 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Julius_Kim Same here.  I didn't feel crazy  anymore for disliking asshole because there are so many logical people here that gave a voice of reason.  Nice to meet you Julius.  Better days are to come!
1332243621458882560 2020-11-27 16:43:25 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> Get another doctor.  He is a quack.
1332213371735830528 2020-11-27 14:43:13 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @NightlyPolitics In isolation with my son on Thanksgiving Eve.  This made me laugh so had I cried.
1332103332803072008 2020-11-27 07:25:58 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @NathanMackBrown @Sskinddad1931 My son and I stayed home and really understood the meaning of Thanksgiving today.  We zoomed with Grandmother and that was priceless.
1332102578541391873 2020-11-27 07:22:58 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @dukewindsor388 @AmyAThatcher I have cut  off so many people because they still think this virus is not real
1332101547833110537 2020-11-27 07:18:52 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @B52Malmet It boggles my mind how delusional people are
1332075091987980295 2020-11-27 05:33:45 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JennaEllisEsq Your are crazy
1332016023525076992 2020-11-27 01:39:02 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> I am so upset with the new justice ( I can't even speak her name without  getting sick).  This is trump land here and we have had huge spikes and now these idiots will further spread this virus.
1332010464985964544 2020-11-27 01:16:57 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @B52Malmet Over here in Staten Island is trump land so people are not following rules.   We have had such a huge spike here. Our schools have closed and now no more indoor  dining. People are losing their businesses here all because of idiots refusing to wear masks
1331991227173117953 2020-11-27 00:00:30 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @GrandpaSnarky @WShmeeps That put such on my face today.  Thank you for sharing.
1331990561386078209 2020-11-26 23:57:51 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @GrandpaSnarky @WShmeeps LOVE IT!!!
1331990235266363393 2020-11-26 23:56:33 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @kylegriffin1 I wish some of his cult would come to their senses.  They believe it was "rigged" and it pisses me off because of all the hard work deadly virus and long hours the poll workers had to endure as  well as all the voters (whom I am so proud of) that fought all the odds and voted.
1331988469237821441 2020-11-26 23:49:32 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TheRickWilson @DetroitDeeDee Happy Thanksgiving Rick.
1331987956568125441 2020-11-26 23:47:30 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @chalkypj I will also say that I did put my two cents in and said that I do not believe the election was "rigged". I am on Staten Island and it is tRump land here so the people in the store all wanted to beat me up.  Insane.
1331987235625955330 2020-11-26 23:44:38 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @chalkypj Oh God no!!!  I was told last night that I am a left wing extremist who promotes criminal behavior because I had a mask while shopping.
1331986887200944134 2020-11-26 23:43:15 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @MamaTriedHoney Never.
1331986335297638403 2020-11-26 23:41:04 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @BeschlossDC @LetsTurnFLBlue Same here.  It was very scary how close we were to loosing our freedom.
1331986116203917313 2020-11-26 23:40:11 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @manhattan_liz I would choose death
1331932254860439552 2020-11-26 20:06:10 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @AlexandraChalup My heart is sickened by all of this.
1331931790236332036 2020-11-26 20:04:19 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @SenDuckworth Tammy, I stand with you.
1331931192837464064 2020-11-26 20:01:57 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @B52Malmet @USATODAY I can not understand how people are not taking this virus seriously.  There are many friends and relatives I will not talk to because they still think the virus is a hoax.  As you said "they are dead to me".  This virus is real.
1331929965504438272 2020-11-26 19:57:04 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @briantylercohen @CindisPLace Last night I was called ignorant and criminal because I do not believe the voting was "rigged" and was told that I support left wing extremists.  The very idea of supporting tRump, stomping on our constitution and allowing his criminal behavior blows my  mind.
1331442087959683075 2020-11-25 11:38:25 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TheDemCoalition For the first time in four years we actually have a president who can read!
1331441879389515776 2020-11-25 11:37:35 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JennaEllisEsq @RudyGiuliani Sweetie, make sure he keeps his hands on the table and not down his pants.

1331440421478805505 2020-11-25 11:31:48 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @fuckcancer56 @JennaEllisEsq I will have the popcorn ready at my house.  Can't wait till they all go off to prison.
1331438470770913280 2020-11-25 11:24:03 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @B52Malmet Hopefully poison
1331438339686326272 2020-11-25 11:23:31 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @itsJeffTiedrich @JennaEllisEsq He is truly a warrior.  He can barley stand with those burn spurs.

1331357189634715654 2020-11-25 06:01:04 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @PattyArquette @ponytail122 Good.  I hope they all rot in prison.
1331093534871597056 2020-11-24 12:33:23 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @mmpadellan Can't wait for Ms. James to make him wet his depends.  Just think a woman of color putting him where he belongs and that is in jail.
1331090140798840833 2020-11-24 12:19:54 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @LeonaLioness6 I needed that laugh!
1331089991930437632 2020-11-24 12:19:19 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump Go away already.  You are boring now. Can't even laugh at you anymore.
1331089649230635015 2020-11-24 12:17:57 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump Maybe Rudy has a trick not up his sleeve but down his pants.  Oh wait, he was just tucking in his shirt.
1331084127911751682 2020-11-24 11:56:01 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @SuzieHanks My prayers.  I am so sorry.

1325965403663855616 2020-11-10 08:56:02 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @GeraldoRivera Guiliani should play Renfield, Barr play Quasimodo and you haven't been relevant for over 20 years so......

1323065034155720705 2020-11-02 08:51:00 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @jonathanskip @TeamTrump tRump is a liar. Biden distinctly said he would not ban fracking.  These guys need to fact check all of his nonsense and lies because nothing that comes out of his mouth is the truth
1323045709835370498 2020-11-02 07:34:12 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @kgreene90 @GOP @realDonaldTrump He is a liar. We can not see our families because many are elderly.  My son has not seen his grandmother in 8 months.

1322993967009615872 2020-11-02 04:08:36 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @RepsForBiden Yes, but maybe today would be  better.  The dangerous lunatic has to go.
1322989201378414592 2020-11-02 03:49:40 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> This is so disgusting.  It is most inconsiderate of and most importantly a danger.  What if an ambulance has to get through???
1322982751868473347 2020-11-02 03:24:02 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump Are ya going to leave those poor people out in the cold waiting for shuttles just to freeze???
1322982592937922562 2020-11-02 03:23:24 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You are the one with the poor debate performance.  A lot of us really like Chris Wallace because he speaks truth and points our your bullshit.
1322981842648289280 2020-11-02 03:20:25 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @AndreaR9Md @csbriers This is so dangerous!!!  How can they get away with this??
1322981596140654600 2020-11-02 03:19:26 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @GOP @realDonaldTrump Guess what we are not enjoying the holidays coming up because most of us don't want to kill our mothers and fathers or grandparents.  Please, wake up!
1322981340913012737 2020-11-02 03:18:26 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump What about hundreds of thousands of people who have died and are suffering now from covid???  Your son lied and said there was hardly anyone dying anymore. You have lied over and over and soon you will be packing your bags
1322978952529498118 2020-11-02 03:08:56 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @chuckwoolery We were lied to about this virus from tRump.  there is no justification for that.
1322977743055761409 2020-11-02 03:04:08 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @sandibox4 @CurtisHouck I don't know if you checked lately they are not in charge.  It is tRump that is.  They can not implement a plan through the democrats in congress.  That is not how this goes.  Are you even from this country?
1322815851121299457 2020-11-01 16:20:50 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @HalstonA @BlackUm79770994 @donwinslow What country published it?
1322774825480425472 2020-11-01 13:37:49 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @donmoyn @SimplotTracy She is out of her mind!!
1322712473271717893 2020-11-01 09:30:03 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @StephenKing So sickened by this.
1322711600227377153 2020-11-01 09:26:34 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @yogi35898 @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump I am thinking she may also go to prison.  At least a gril can dream.
1322691034648842240 2020-11-01 08:04:51 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump The world knows who you all really are.
1322664367708581893 2020-11-01 06:18:53 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TheDemCoalition What a nice "christian" man
1322660420130361346 2020-11-01 06:03:12 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @rmcough @donwinslow This is very scary.  I do believe this to be true also.
1322656946114174976 2020-11-01 05:49:24 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TinaMPerry4 @realDonaldTrump Exactly!!!  I have a very close friend who believed that covid was a "hoax".  Now she has it and is sick.  Too many people that listen to him are either sick or will be sick.  Very sad.
1322645124854222852 2020-11-01 05:02:25 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TinaMPerry4 @realDonaldTrump He is a monster and doesn't care if we live or die as long as his pockets get lined.  Sadly, his supporters do not see this.
1322642537748877312 2020-11-01 04:52:09 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @dinsdk @realDonaldTrump We have to keep the faith and pray.
1322641989523939330 2020-11-01 04:49:58 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @CurtisIngraham1 @jrzgrlnsunshine @IngrahamAngle Thank you for your honesty and integrity
1322641596794523657 2020-11-01 04:48:24 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DianeBernaerts @chuckwoolery Well, we know he is nuts.
1322641061685141511 2020-11-01 04:46:17 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @ddale8 We want him out!!  The man has no shame nor pride.
1322640898811985920 2020-11-01 04:45:38 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @dinsdk @realDonaldTrump Karen, it is crazy here!  There are so many nuts not listening.   Those nuts are calling themselves the "red army" and it is very alarming.  I heard many say we will only get covid if we have no God in our lives.  They say they follow tRump who is God fearing so they are safe.
1322638744659415042 2020-11-01 04:37:04 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @davidmweissman Scared.
1322638507454713856 2020-11-01 04:36:08 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @donwinslow The crazier he gets the crazier his cult gets.
1322638341704220673 2020-11-01 04:35:28 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @dinsdk @realDonaldTrump The world is either laughing for us or terrified for us.
1322638153342210048 2020-11-01 04:34:43 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Teresa69482955 @EricTrump @claudiatenney @realDonaldTrump That is just my point.  We should not be divided and this is what is happening.  We have a deadly disease killing us, job loss and health care that is going to be stripped from us and you are bragging about a red army???  This disease doesn't give shit what color any army is.
1322635968046862339 2020-11-01 04:26:02 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @ddale8 Wow, just wow.  He is an idiot.
1322468608480522242 2020-10-31 17:21:01 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @LizForTX8 I watched that one.  Nothing is going to sell me on his innocence.  I think he is reckless in his behavior and I will not change my mind.  For three years I was a big cheerleader but when you lie and people die that is when you lost me
1322467414823604229 2020-10-31 17:16:16 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @LizForTX8 When she went to China Town it was Feb., 24th and none of us knew that this was transmitted through the air.  Even when things closed up on March 13th we all did not want to touch boxes because we thought it was from touch and didn't know about air transmission.
1322466776861577216 2020-10-31 17:13:44 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @LizForTX8 tRump knew about this in Jan., 2020 and chose not to us.  He spoke on Bob Woodward's recordings and told him threat it was very deadly and transmitted through the air.  At the time he and only he knew about this.
1322463272587636736 2020-10-31 16:59:49 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @LizForTX8 My point is that if tRump didn't withhold such crucial information from us for almost 2 months so many more people would be alive today.
1322462545932931072 2020-10-31 16:56:55 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @LizForTX8 The issue is that so many people have underlying conditions and could live but since this virus is deadly and spreads like wildfire it is a concern.  His words are very misleading.  My nephew was diabetic and it was being managed and then he was hit with covid
1322461911032733697 2020-10-31 16:54:24 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @LizForTX8 Alot of cases could have been managed but since their immune system was low covid killed them.
1322460894413131776 2020-10-31 16:50:22 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @LizForTX8 So why would all these doctors all over the country lie????
1322459433826439169 2020-10-31 16:44:33 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @LizForTX8 I hear him say that doctors get etxra money to say that a patient died because of covid.
1322456933778018304 2020-10-31 16:34:37 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @LizForTX8 Yes, finally!!!  I stink at this.
1322455872170299402 2020-10-31 16:30:24 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @LizForTX8 It is the first clip on my profile page.  I can not figure out how to send it to you.  I can't copy and paste it.  I will just tweet it out again and I guess it will go to your feed?
1322455410591342593 2020-10-31 16:28:34 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @realDonaldTrump @Timcast I think that is the way it should be.  Sometimes a person just has such strong character no matter what party.
1322454630249467904 2020-10-31 16:25:28 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @realDonaldTrump @Timcast The misinformation he spews out is damaging and people listen to him.  It is just reckless.
1322453431248949248 2020-10-31 16:20:42 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @ShuriResists Did you see the video clip yet of the Michigan rally?
1322452310807760896 2020-10-31 16:16:15 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @LizForTX8 The picture proves nothing.  Did you see the video clip of the Michigan rally yet???  I would be interested in your thoughts on tRumps horrific comments abut frontliners
1322449111791161344 2020-10-31 16:03:32 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @realDonaldTrump Ok, I get your point but I am not sure if you got my DM??  My point with tRump is that he gives out misinformation and people listen and that is reckless.
1322448718839402497 2020-10-31 16:01:59 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @realDonaldTrump I think all across the board.  Groceries, electric, heat are expensive pretty much everywhere.
1322446215892639744 2020-10-31 15:52:02 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @realDonaldTrump My computer is screwed up and it won't allow me to copy and paste.  I think I sent you a DM.  I am not to functional on Twitter.  It was covered on Fox news by a guy named Sean Hannity
1322443853643866112 2020-10-31 15:42:39 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @realDonaldTrump I have the video clip on my main page and I don't know how to send it to you.  It was covered on Fox and it was at his Michigan rally.
1322434976823103488 2020-10-31 15:07:22 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TinaMPerry4 @realDonaldTrump He is just like gum under my shoe at this point.  He just keeps repeating these insane lies all the time
1322434454024048643 2020-10-31 15:05:18 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @realDonaldTrump He just said that frontliners get a financial incentive to say that people died from covid.  That was not only insane but so disrespectful to all of the people risking their lives everyday to save others.  The man is a lunatic
1322432469140934656 2020-10-31 14:57:24 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @genej101 @ou812nun @realDonaldTrump I just watched this and I cried too.  I lost my nephew 14 years, a cousin 48 and an aunt 76 all to covid.  I am sickened that the monster in charge is still killing people and it is just happening right in front of our eyes.
1322429167640653824 2020-10-31 14:44:17 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @realDonaldTrump I am disgusted by the rioting.  We need responsible leadership all the way around.  How DeBlasio handled the riots here was disgusting.  The lack of common sense from both parties is amazing.
1322428666408828929 2020-10-31 14:42:18 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @realDonaldTrump But people listen to tRump and he doesn't lead by example.  He has been reckless and careless and it is troubling
1322421106452692992 2020-10-31 14:12:15 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @realDonaldTrump Well, Fox is all propaganda.  Also, I was talking about New Zealand.  The Prime Minister Jacinda Arden  has done great over there
1322409117428973568 2020-10-31 13:24:37 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @realDonaldTrump Then I guess we can only hope for the best.
1322407519055237120 2020-10-31 13:18:16 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @realDonaldTrump Also, I don't believe in lock downs.  I believe in giving people credible, scientific information.  Encouraging masks and social distancing.
1322407042775162880 2020-10-31 13:16:22 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @realDonaldTrump Have you checked out New Zealand???
1322403616997675008 2020-10-31 13:02:46 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @realDonaldTrump I actually have recently.  We had both thought maybe an idea?  Did you see that by them using herd immunity cases have surged.  I don't know what o think anymore
1322403007426895872 2020-10-31 13:00:20 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Donnalee711 My thoughts exactly.  What he has gone through truly, truly is heartbreaking.  If anyone can relish in someone else suffering are very, very sick people.  So sad.
1322401298260631552 2020-10-31 12:53:33 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump So many people have died and suffered and still have no national plan and show not once ounce of empathy for the suffering
1322392056472440832 2020-10-31 12:16:49 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Nora_Evans___ I didn't really see you but I did see most without masks so it seems you are ok with that??  I do not live in fear but respect my boundaries and social distance.  As far as Jesus, please tell  me how tRump who paid off porn stars a Godly leader
1322390767520927745 2020-10-31 12:11:42 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump What great American comeback???  We are going to be dead thanks to covid and assholes like you
1322390321624420355 2020-10-31 12:09:56 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Nora_Evans___ Do you not see how many are dying and suffering???  It is horrible to hear you brag about the turn out because by not distancing and not wearing masks someone may get  sick and god forbid die or infect someone else and that person dies.  WTF is wrong with you people?
1322389196087152640 2020-10-31 12:05:27 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @CurtisHouck Is that all ya got???  What about the 230,000 people that died and more are still dying.
1322387900873510913 2020-10-31 12:00:19 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @pastorlocke Is it Christian for a married man to pay off porn stars???  Get real.
1322373899749937152 2020-10-31 11:04:40 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JasonMillerinDC You should all start packing
1322371430756110336 2020-10-31 10:54:52 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @Google @CNN You are a coward
1322370281118322688 2020-10-31 10:50:18 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr Really reaching now.  You people are desperate and the world sees it.
1322367811008765952 2020-10-31 10:40:29 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr Why did you lie on tv and say that the deaths from covid are very low???  The world knows that you are all liars
1322354754173997056 2020-10-31 09:48:36 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @bridget_joy_ Amazingly I do know some that did.
1322323470714392576 2020-10-31 07:44:17 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump You are a monster and the world knows it.
1322322716201013248 2020-10-31 07:41:17 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump Work, is that what you people call stealing?
1322321626281771008 2020-10-31 07:36:57 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump I can smell your desperation through my computer screen.
1322320509007220736 2020-10-31 07:32:31 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump Have some pride for once.  If no one wanted me around I would just go.  You are the gum on everyone's shoe
1322319487752937473 2020-10-31 07:28:28 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump Mikey boy, you still do not talk of all of those who have suffered and died and the numbers keep climbing.  You call yourself a christian and I call you a fucking coward with no backbone. Stand up and say the truth
1322317923541803010 2020-10-31 07:22:15 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump The world is laughing at you and you know it but you have no pride and no shame
1322317684097376265 2020-10-31 07:21:18 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @KLF @LaraLeaTrump @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump You people are like gum on everyone's shoe.
1322317161977782273 2020-10-31 07:19:13 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Are you still begging for money???
1322316659948998657 2020-10-31 07:17:13 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump Fuck the wall asshole.  What about all the people dying and suffering from this deadly virus
1322315414383321096 2020-10-31 07:12:16 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @laurie_ohio Praying for you.
1322315042772180994 2020-10-31 07:10:48 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @EricTrump You and Junior are the "dunce brothers".  I can not take credit for that but when I heard that I laughed so hard I pissed my pants.  Kind of like you are doing right now.
1322310848099045376 2020-10-31 06:54:08 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump He will kill the American dream???  But wait, wasn't it you that is responsible for 225,000 deaths and still counting??
1322310264755281922 2020-10-31 06:51:49 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr Like any of us gives a shit of what the Home Depot guy says.  You are all so pathetic
1322302909493710848 2020-10-31 06:22:35 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump You are a fucking lunatic and the world knows it.  You know how other countries laugh at you, let's not prretend.
1322302575409070083 2020-10-31 06:21:15 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse When he paid off the porn star was that a "conservative ideal"?
1322298428727152647 2020-10-31 06:04:47 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump What about you killing 225,000 Americans.  The world knows who you are.
1322297826072797191 2020-10-31 06:02:23 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @4everNeverTrump Desperate.  When they are gone we will all be able to breathe easier.
1322297440356192256 2020-10-31 06:00:51 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Bill43111 @realDonaldTrump I love the "dunce sons".  Couldn't have summed it better myself.
1322296410054819840 2020-10-31 05:56:45 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump You repeat yourself over and over.  Have some pride man and move along
1322295137855221762 2020-10-31 05:51:42 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump You should be in jail and the world knows it.  We can all smell the desperation seeping out of you.
1322287150860275715 2020-10-31 05:19:58 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @AZGOP @Mike_Pence Pence, go and FUCK yourself.  Remember, we see everyday all the death and suffering.
1322286961059651584 2020-10-31 05:19:13 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump You are a domestic terrorist.  You let over 225,000 people die and the numbers are still growing.
1322286160773828609 2020-10-31 05:16:02 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @KarenPence Must be nice while so much suffering and death is going on.  Shame on you
1322285968976728065 2020-10-31 05:15:16 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @ddale8 I hate to say this but after all of this and he is in jail and then dead history will remember him I think only second to Hitler.  So in that sense I think he will be "famous"
1322272362092503041 2020-10-31 04:21:12 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump SDNY and then Rikers Island for you.
1322270198129434625 2020-10-31 04:12:36 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @kirstiealley Honey, I do not watch CNN and did vote for tRump and I can telll you this virus is real.  I lost my 14 year old nephhew, a cousin who was 48 and an aunt 76 all to covid.
1322269075209392130 2020-10-31 04:08:08 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump Get a job and stop mooching off of us.
1322268632244781056 2020-10-31 04:06:23 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump Interesting to see what happens when a rat is cornered.
1322268149128044544 2020-10-31 04:04:27 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump You sacrificed over 225,000 lives all for your gain and the world knows it.
1322267920752365569 2020-10-31 04:03:33 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You are the fucking liar and the world knows.  Don't you have an ounce of pride???  You and your family have mooched off of us long enough.  Everyone knows you are broke
1322267300318367752 2020-10-31 04:01:05 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump We are tired of your lies, your shitty hair, your being a draft dodger and a moocher on our dime.  Have some pride and just go away.
1322264709874307073 2020-10-31 03:50:47 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @EricTrump @claudiatenney @realDonaldTrump You didn't start packing yet???  My whole family voted Biden.  The world knows who you all are.
1322246614141095936 2020-10-31 02:38:53 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump The world knows what a fucking monster you are.  Start packing and getting that U-Haul.
1322244869235089414 2020-10-31 02:31:57 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @AHappyHourHero @kirstiealley I think she is beyond help.
1322241641223278592 2020-10-31 02:19:07 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr If you are having trouble paying for your daddy's U-Haul to get him the fuck out of the People's House then I am sure we all can chip.  It's time to go.
1322237570466668545 2020-10-31 02:02:57 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @charliekirk11 Most would call tRump a wee bit desperate.
1322234899584159746 2020-10-31 01:52:20 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @KarenPence @realDonaldTrump @Mike_Pence @TeamTrump Sweetie, you should start packing and getting your U-Haul truck ready
1322234525313867778 2020-10-31 01:50:51 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @NeilfanVegas @wickedwone Funny you mention this because for some reason it really set in for me today that he really is that sick and demented even more then I thought before and did this for all as a ploy.
1322231536683548678 2020-10-31 01:38:58 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @funder Please let this be the case.  Thank you for giving some of us hope that thee may be some justice.
1322084811704586245 2020-10-30 15:55:56 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr We are dying and suffering!!!  What has your daddy done for us.  Start packing fucking asshole.
1322083672078647296 2020-10-30 15:51:25 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @katalva3 @koolkaryn They are murderers!
1322083293693726722 2020-10-30 15:49:54 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr Start packing Junior.  The world knows who you are and the rest of your clan
1322081869782011904 2020-10-30 15:44:15 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Please just fucking stop.
1322076605666217984 2020-10-30 15:23:20 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump Go to bed already.  The world knows who you are and is laughing at you.  So stop.
1322075756151902208 2020-10-30 15:19:57 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @CNNPolitics @donwinslow Lady, you have to go and you will
1322059433594281986 2020-10-30 14:15:06 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @CheriJacobus @SnickOld I am so sorry.  Keeping your nephew in my prayers.
1321958876649017344 2020-10-30 07:35:31 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @suzzetteCam I hear they are super absorbent for those long golf outings.
1321958669177790464 2020-10-30 07:34:42 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump You are trying to steal the election.  Please, just go because many, many of us do not want you living in the People's House anymore.
1321938529967132673 2020-10-30 06:14:40 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @RyanAFournier You are rally stupid.  Fact check and do some homework
1321929543540744192 2020-10-30 05:38:58 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @mmpadellan I am in Brooklyn too.  Still doing a costume thing but staying home, eating candy and doing create your own hot chocolate "masterpiece" night.
1321925436759302147 2020-10-30 05:22:38 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump Another super spreader.  What the hell is wrong with you???
1321888239255539712 2020-10-30 02:54:50 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @MilesTaylorUSA @wickedwone He needs prison.
1321851423030726656 2020-10-30 00:28:32 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump Everyone knows you are a liar.
1321848988203704320 2020-10-30 00:18:52 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @chuckwoolery Many of us can think 226,000 reasons
1321807696585175041 2020-10-29 21:34:47 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @IvankaTrump The world sees who you all are.  Start getting that U-Haul ready
1321806546553155592 2020-10-29 21:30:13 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @EricTrump Do you often talk back to yourself on Twitter??
1321805767515742209 2020-10-29 21:27:07 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr The world knows just who you all are.  Most of us have voted already and you are all done.  Start packing Junior.
1321805190664753152 2020-10-29 21:24:50 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @thekjohnston Disgusting that they can dance and look like asses while hundreds of thousands have died and are still suffering.
1321804224259334145 2020-10-29 21:20:59 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr All my family members who are republican voted for Joe.  Junior, we all know you lied and so does the world.
1321802554716684288 2020-10-29 21:14:21 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump I am a republican and I blame tRump.  He knew the virus was deadly and transmitted through the air and lied to us.  He still is not taking this serious.  Everyone knows he lied and that is why we have gone out in droves to vote.  He is done.
1321799986200403969 2020-10-29 21:04:09 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @IngrahamAngle I will curse about him for nothing!!  Fuck tRump.
1321799654556733444 2020-10-29 21:02:50 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @MsShannonFisher @fred_guttenberg He is a liar and only has a self interest.  There should not be all this death, there shouldn't be 17 year olds allowed to carry assault weapons. Nothing you say will change my mind.  He is a self serving jerk
1321798752559128576 2020-10-29 20:59:15 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @GeraldoRivera @wickedwone @POTUS Trust me we Republicans here in NY blame him for lying to us and still not taking this seriously..We have come out in droves and hie is done.
1321797814243000320 2020-10-29 20:55:31 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump You knew how deadly the disease was and that it was transmitted through the air and never told us.  My whole family already voted for Biden.  The world knows who you really are.
1321793711362183169 2020-10-29 20:39:13 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @MsShannonFisher @fred_guttenberg There was no empathy.  He couldn't wait to say for us to get back out there for the economy.
1321776507694522373 2020-10-29 19:30:51 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @MsShannonFisher @fred_guttenberg That guy just spews hate and division.  He makes no big deal about loss of life, only cares about his ratings.  Not an ounce of empathy for anyone.
1321719203175555072 2020-10-29 15:43:09 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> This is why the scum endorsed tRump.
1321718683954270209 2020-10-29 15:41:05 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JoshOlsen14 @Jessicam6946 I decided to keep my son home and learn remotely.  Luckily I am in NY and we were given a choice from early on.  Although I did not care if the truant police would come because trump and betsy devos were trying to force schools to fully open.  Sickening.
1321715624905768961 2020-10-29 15:28:55 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @NancyLeeGrahn Same here.  A lot of cursing and some crying in between
1321714830185738241 2020-10-29 15:25:46 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @RZarrinnam @realDonaldTrump I think so.
1321714610563649544 2020-10-29 15:24:54 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JoshOlsen14 @Jessicam6946 Two kids in mys son's school have covid and the school had to shut down.  Sadly, last April a classmate of my son passed away.  I think about that little boy and his family everyday.
1321710219869757442 2020-10-29 15:07:27 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @thehill The problem is he is not a man
1321709316265648131 2020-10-29 15:03:51 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Jessicam6946 @JoshOlsen14 This is so heartbreaking.
1321708728274571267 2020-10-29 15:01:31 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Mike_Pence Does "mother" have the Hunter Biden documents or are they in tRump's diaper???
1321701462653734912 2020-10-29 14:32:39 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @jeremynewberger @camoxendale I think we got our dry cleaning mixed up.  I found the documents with my dry cleaning pickup but left them on the subway during rush hour and now they are gone.
1321671450198200320 2020-10-29 12:33:23 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump Why no holidays if Biden wins????
1321670812483620866 2020-10-29 12:30:51 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump @DonnaShalala It's late for you.  Go to sleep now sweetie.
1321669755544240129 2020-10-29 12:26:39 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump You are all liars and the world knows it.
1321654150086742016 2020-10-29 11:24:39 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @SeanPenn Rikers Island for the whole clan.
1321653726780792835 2020-10-29 11:22:58 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @bryanbehar @wickedwone Hang on because it isn't even Thursday yet.
1321653502515564545 2020-10-29 11:22:04 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @mspoint1106 @wickedwone They are murderers.  They  need to be put in prison.
1321653183920381953 2020-10-29 11:20:48 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @kurteichenwald Count me in.
1321651943022972928 2020-10-29 11:15:52 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Amy_Siskind She is kick ass!!!  We need her!!!
1321647470330499072 2020-10-29 10:58:06 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump You are done!!!
1321640040456486913 2020-10-29 10:28:35 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @KarenPence You should start getting that U-Haul ready sweetie.
1321639398379835393 2020-10-29 10:26:02 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @FoxNews I will curse him out for nothing.  FUCK HIM!
1321634236701544448 2020-10-29 10:05:31 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr So when Junior says his daddy is more isolated now, does that mean n more porn stars?
1321633387615014913 2020-10-29 10:02:09 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr Your a dick.  You all knew about this disease and lied to us.  The world knows what dicks you all are.
1321633149764489217 2020-10-29 10:01:12 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @AC360 @bestgiftpurpose They are all murderers.  The killer clown and his clan all need prison
1321630370333368320 2020-10-29 09:50:09 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Amy_Siskind Looks like he has that old "lock jaw" going on.  Sucks that we even have to pay for his drug habits.
1321629817020829696 2020-10-29 09:47:57 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @AHappyHourHero @realDonaldTrump Chris, you just put the biggest smile on my face!!!  They all need to rot in prison!
1321619598169513985 2020-10-29 09:07:21 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TheRickWilson Love it!!!!
1321583151777546242 2020-10-29 06:42:31 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DanScavino Yay, another super spreader!!!  Jerkoffs!
1321582906326863872 2020-10-29 06:41:33 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @itsJeffTiedrich @elis_lady @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @Google @CNN Jeff, how can that be???  The clown said he didn't know the guy!!!!  He has to be the stupidest ass hat out there.  His lies are off the chart!!
1321582399805935621 2020-10-29 06:39:32 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump You have to be FUCKING kidding me????  People are dying and suffering!!!  You  are a monster and the world knows it!!!
1321581630608297990 2020-10-29 06:36:29 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump Fake News???  Your Fake News and the world knows it.
1321580094192865284 2020-10-29 06:30:22 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TaraLV_7451 @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @Google @CNN Same shit different day with that clown.
1321579354019844097 2020-10-29 06:27:26 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @Google @CNN How you lie!!!  There is a list of people that you say you don't know but thee are videos, pictures audio out there to prove otherwise.  Your an asshole and the world knows it!
1321563793634267140 2020-10-29 05:25:36 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JoyAnnReid Exactly!!!  Our world is like living haywire so you really have to stop and think what is real and what is not
1321562823214964737 2020-10-29 05:21:45 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @B52Malmet It was 30 people?!?!  He is trying to kill us anyway he can!
1321561626223562753 2020-10-29 05:16:59 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @MaryLTrump @natsechobbyist @blaireerskine Mary, same here.  Everything in this country is so insane right now we don't know what is satire or what is real.
1321542125339713537 2020-10-29 03:59:30 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr Stop it! , Junior!!  You are all liars and the world knows
1321537046285082627 2020-10-29 03:39:19 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr @JoeBiden Your all done and the world knows it.
1321535155257880576 2020-10-29 03:31:48 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @whiskeylegsn5th @LynnMcCown Wow!!!!  Everyday has been a coaster ride for all of us!!!
1321534754685132801 2020-10-29 03:30:13 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @whiskeylegsn5th @LynnMcCown Oh crap!!!
1321533872958558208 2020-10-29 03:26:42 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump Your done and the world knows it.
1321533769774485505 2020-10-29 03:26:18 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> Insane!!
1321533620306219008 2020-10-29 03:25:42 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @whiskeylegsn5th @LynnMcCown Thank you for the info.  Maybe some good news for a change!!!
1321531116944314371 2020-10-29 03:15:45 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @LynnMcCown David, I and so many others are hoping for this nightmare to end.  Maybe it is wishful thinking, but I do hope there is an announcement today and that somehow the clown is gone
1321527904392650755 2020-10-29 03:02:59 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump My family all have already voted for Biden.  Now go take your nap sweetie.
1321443060346216448 2020-10-28 21:25:51 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @IvankaTrump You are all liars and the world knows it
1321408887464071169 2020-10-28 19:10:04 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @AnitaFinlay That is the problem because while a lot of us will be responsible some are plain fools and I have seen in my area alone a few "catch the covid virus" parties.   I have come to realize common sense is not so common.
1321408393781936128 2020-10-28 19:08:06 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @AnitaFinlay I am actually very interested in a lot of nordic ways and I also thought that was something to consider.  Sometimes we get trapped in our Western way of thinking.
1321407121360125953 2020-10-28 19:03:02 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @AnitaFinlay I didn't care if who  to was a democrat or a republican my son was not going school back until it was safe. My son has close to 6,000 kids in his school.  My 14 year old nephew suffered and my sister will never be the same so this is very personal for me.
1321405821775945730 2020-10-28 18:57:53 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @AnitaFinlay My feelings is that it didn't have to be that way.  If we were told the truth from the very start we would have been able to better protect ourselves.  I liked tRump up until I realized he kept the truth from us.
1321405414244831232 2020-10-28 18:56:15 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @AnitaFinlay Why I know the specifics is on March 12th my nephew got very ill at school.  It was later confirmed that he had covid and the school shut down  but all the rest of the damn schools in NYC were still open.  Trust me that is on DeBlasio and Cuomo.  My nephew died three weeks later.
1321404463471611904 2020-10-28 18:52:29 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @AnitaFinlay When he did put a ban on travel to and from Europe that as on March 13th at 12 am.  By then it was already too late because the virus was here.
1321404122646695936 2020-10-28 18:51:07 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @AnitaFinlay He also did not ban travel from China but only put restrictions and at the time most people did not know how infectious it was so people thought he was nuts.  Again, misinformation for the public.  When he did put he restrictions no one was tested or quarantined.
1321403449318268928 2020-10-28 18:48:27 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @AnitaFinlay Also, tRump did know about this virus well in advance and knew it was transmitted through the air and never told us.  When he gave his State of the Union address he never said it was transmitted through the air and knew about this virus at least a month in advance.
1321402933183995904 2020-10-28 18:46:24 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @AnitaFinlay The problem I see with the narrative is that WHO did not encourage masks on Feb. 27th but Pelosi get scritisized on Feb. 24th for not wearing a mask in China Town.
1321393960653328387 2020-10-28 18:10:45 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @AnitaFinlay I agree with the marches as well, I don't think crowds are a safe bet.  I also agree that lock downs make you go bonkers.  Although, if tRump would encourage masks, and social distancing people would listen and it would truly make a difference.
1321390788161474560 2020-10-28 17:58:08 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @AnitaFinlay So many covid cases have been traced back to his rallies.  I may be over cautious but again remember we are over populated here where I live.  I have friends upstate who think I am nuts but they live in farm area and live far apart.
1321386829548081153 2020-10-28 17:42:25 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @SBfut3 @liliumrossa I am so sorry.  You are right because it did not have to be this way.
1321386489587113984 2020-10-28 17:41:03 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @VoteBH_2020 He did say that he would hold back funding for any precinct who did not comply with reform.  He wants better training and more mental health counselors in the precincts so when a crisis arises they can help the police deal with dangerous and crazy situations.
1321381507328548864 2020-10-28 17:21:16 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @JoeBiden I appreciated that video.  What that guy said is what I hoped others would.  There should not be hate either way.  In the This angry divide bothers me because the world is watching and we need to find what unites us and not divides us.
1321379598689570816 2020-10-28 17:13:41 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @VoteBH_2020 I could not imagine what the cops see or go through.  There should be more access to mental health and grief counselors for them for starters.  More funding so that they may have  more staff so that they can have some more time off and not work double shifts and burn out.
1321368308629803008 2020-10-28 16:28:49 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @VoteBH_2020 I am sure everything on the internet is true
1321353129967964162 2020-10-28 15:28:30 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @brianklaas I am seeing that most politicians are full of shit.  It is scary.
1321352929215995906 2020-10-28 15:27:42 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @brianklaas I don't watch CNN.  I try to stay neutral and make up my own mind without bias from Fox or CNN.
1321352545307164673 2020-10-28 15:26:11 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @brianklaas His former partner and others speak of Trump's project buildings and his ties to Brighton Beach.  As I said before the buildings were dumps and most of us here considered him as a slum lord.
1321352017474949123 2020-10-28 15:24:05 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @brianklaas Amazon has a series Trump*Russia (yes it is biased) but interesting for me because his former partner Felix Seter who speaks of Brighton Beach, Sheapshead Bay and Coney Island.  How he described the places was so accurate.
1321349403626668032 2020-10-28 15:13:41 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @brianklaas I have seen that too.  He can be a little intimidating to me.  But I do enjoy his show.
1321342720628187137 2020-10-28 14:47:08 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @brianklaas Bannon is credible.  Is he on house arrest??

1321319520498339840 2020-10-28 13:14:57 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC How is the covid thing going????  You are all liars and the world knows it.
1321316970256605185 2020-10-28 13:04:49 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump You brag about your covid super spreaders.  You are bat shit crazy and the world knows it.
1321312644872155137 2020-10-28 12:47:37 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump You are the liar and a thief and the world knows
1321302461198512134 2020-10-28 12:07:10 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump It's past bedtime..do your diaper change and go to sleep
1321277085189656577 2020-10-28 10:26:19 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @IvankaTrump Rikers Island have really nice accommodations waiting for you
1321276065898180608 2020-10-28 10:22:16 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump I see you are not done yet with your super spreaders.  Wouldn't it be more beneficial if you kept your supporters alive??
1321275592537481217 2020-10-28 10:20:24 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump You are a fool and the world knows it.
1321275052873158657 2020-10-28 10:18:15 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump Great job, I guess you are not done yet killing people with your covid super spreader.
1321274395646664706 2020-10-28 10:15:38 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump You are a quack and the world is laughing at you.
1321254967747989504 2020-10-28 08:58:26 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr How about you all do your fucking jobs????   Daddy watches tv all day and rage tweets.
1321254660787834880 2020-10-28 08:57:13 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump Make sure to spread as much covid as you can sweetie.  You know how much "mother" likes dead things since she is married to you.
1321254413235834881 2020-10-28 08:56:14 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr Yikes Junior  You are and idiot and the world knows it.
1321210037319176192 2020-10-28 05:59:54 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr I know because your daddy is tough.  He hides in his bunker after provoking violence.  He is a coward and the world knows it.
1321208535464771585 2020-10-28 05:53:56 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @AHappyHourHero @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump I think it could be Donnie's baby.
1321208442820923394 2020-10-28 05:53:34 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Why bother.  We will all be dead because of daddy's coivd fuck up.
1321208067535548416 2020-10-28 05:52:04 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @chester_burl @Ruimmar @bravoaddict3 @MercifulCathol1 @TeamTrump Man Woman Person Camera TV.  What more can we say about the moron.
1321207686864736259 2020-10-28 05:50:34 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @bigcubes427 @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump It surely was but not a deadly.  Sadly people did die but the number of people who passed away was 12,000 as opposed to covid where we have lost close to 227,000 lives since march.  I lost a 14 yearold nephew and this is real and it is deadly.
1321200827323789312 2020-10-28 05:23:18 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr So is your boy Rudy with his hands down his pants.  I threw up in my mouth twice and then twice more before contemplating running away.  But wait, no other countries want us because  of your daddy's covid fuck up .
1321199852349464577 2020-10-28 05:19:26 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @HarveyWilms @IvankaTrump I already looked at you blog and can not wait to read it tonight.  Everyone here is so worried and loosing sleep and I was looking for a good read.  Than you and be safe!
1321198741295157251 2020-10-28 05:15:01 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @HarveyWilms @IvankaTrump Yes , would be interested to read..  Can you sen the link???
1321196136535887872 2020-10-28 05:04:40 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @HarveyWilms @IvankaTrump I am sorry you can  not come to visit but in the state we are in it is probably the safest for you.  I believe the fool, will be voted out because he can not spin and lie about a deadly disease.  Most seem too smart for that.
1321193199113768961 2020-10-28 04:52:59 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @HarveyWilms @IvankaTrump Hello from Brooklyn, NY.
1321191725864493058 2020-10-28 04:47:08 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @HarveyWilms @IvankaTrump Thanks for that.  The image made me smile!!
1321189120039919617 2020-10-28 04:36:47 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @megdad @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Rikers is waiting for him
1321188795505672194 2020-10-28 04:35:30 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @IvankaTrump I hear the rooms at Rikers are very comfy sweetie.
1321188589338808324 2020-10-28 04:34:40 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr You are all liars and the world knows.
1321188235293458434 2020-10-28 04:33:16 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Rikers is waiting for you sweetie
1321184823843688457 2020-10-28 04:19:43 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @lorlh @TeamTrump I will say I wasn't a big Biden fan but tRumps handling of this pandemic has been horrific
1321184316836188160 2020-10-28 04:17:42 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Staciopathic @TeamTrump That would be some crazy shit because my dad died 20 years ago.
1321183825590996993 2020-10-28 04:15:45 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @lennox1231 @robreiner Can you answer why if tRump knew about how deadly this virus was and that it was transmitted through the air how come he did not tell us???
1321183140753408005 2020-10-28 04:13:01 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @doncorboni @Jimbr11 @TeamTrump Where is there that you speak of??
1321181779756199937 2020-10-28 04:07:37 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @chester_burl @Ruimmar @bravoaddict3 @MercifulCathol1 @TeamTrump Let's not forget he is quite intelligent also.  His suggestion that we ingest disinfectant was genius.  Who else can say Man Woman Person Camera TV without skipping a beat.  The cult leader is off the charts.
1321141697447895040 2020-10-28 01:28:20 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Mike_Pence Your such a gem.  Having another super spreader to make sure more people suffer and die.  You keep outdoing yourself sweetie.
1321141293746130946 2020-10-28 01:26:44 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @kgreene90 @first2find @theroadhoarier @MercifulCathol1 @TeamTrump I still think people will follow him and make excuses that the Deep State actually did that or some crazy bull crap.  It is quite frightening.
1321140675879067649 2020-10-28 01:24:17 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TeaPainUSA He is a busy guy.  This morning alone his rage tweets and watching Obama kept him very  busy.  Now this evening with his Kovid Klux Klan super spreader he will probably have killed a few people with covid and had some other people set on fire by the Klan and it is only Tuesday
1321139409786462212 2020-10-28 01:19:15 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @itsJeffTiedrich @ponytail122 @realDonaldTrump I am hoping the only time that idiot returns to NY is when  he is shipped to Rikers
1321139121851682817 2020-10-28 01:18:06 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @EricTrump Is our taxpaying dollars putting your ass up there???
1321130510920404992 2020-10-28 00:43:53 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump Oh you delusion boy.  I am sure you will settle in at Rikers Island nicely
1321127313803747328 2020-10-28 00:31:11 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You are so jelly of Obama.  By the way don't you have any work to do or watching tv all fucking day your job?
1321123785391693825 2020-10-28 00:17:10 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @AHappyHourHero Hopefully the only pimping being done after the election is when he is behind bars and one of his cellmates wants to pimp his diapered ass out.
1321123198767943680 2020-10-28 00:14:50 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JoyousPanther @DonaldJTrumpJr The guy is a nut.
1321122909360893953 2020-10-28 00:13:41 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @LinkHogbrow @realDonaldTrump I hear Rikers Island and the tombs have lovely accommodations. If he is lucky he may even get a little boyfriend there.
1321122122220134403 2020-10-28 00:10:33 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr You guys sink so fucking low.  You do know that rag is FAKE NEWS as daddy calls the media.  That rag is known not to be a credible source.
1321121142107766788 2020-10-28 00:06:40 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump Do you have any idea of what you agree to???  You are stupid and the world knows it and is laughing at you
1321120854906933249 2020-10-28 00:05:31 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr When you say lit would it be like when you and your girl were lit at the RNC???  Just asking for a friend.
1321120468150198275 2020-10-28 00:03:59 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JoshOlsen14 @ponytail122 @realDonaldTrump Let's not forget he suggested we ingest disinfectant, windmills causes cancer and if Biden wins elder Floridians will not have anymore air conditioning.  Josh, you gave me a good laugh!!  I am hoping they come out with a coffee table book of all his stupid nonsense.
1321119051129802752 2020-10-27 23:58:21 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @InTheMiddleWit2 @ponytail122 @realDonaldTrump I'm sure Patsy Cline had him in mind,  no doubt.  That song sums up his unhinged behavior perfectly
1321116341701672961 2020-10-27 23:47:35 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Bill43111 @realDonaldTrump There was n doubt in my mind that his diaper needed changing.
1321115822996230144 2020-10-27 23:45:32 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Bill43111 @realDonaldTrump Good one!!!  Although my brain is burning with that image of his fat ass running away.
1321114743164338181 2020-10-27 23:41:14 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump You are the laughing stock of the world.
1321114432429346816 2020-10-27 23:40:00 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @gtconway3d George, love it!!!  I can not stop laughing .
1321111070128431105 2020-10-27 23:26:38 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Your nose is growing again Pinocchio.
1321110367909695489 2020-10-27 23:23:51 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Rosie @heartsandroses9 I am so very proud of Ms. Carroll for her courage to stand up to her rapist.
1321110047473176576 2020-10-27 23:22:35 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump Yes, along with another covid wave.  You are such a little shit.
1321109077548769280 2020-10-27 23:18:43 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @peppelaar_media @billjac2 @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump I was on Staten Island the day of that rally and steered clear of that.  Those sheep are going to jump off the cliff soon.
1321108300314877955 2020-10-27 23:15:38 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @biannagolodryga @Santa_Claus_007 What a nasty little man
1321106780974469122 2020-10-27 23:09:36 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump Everything you do and say is to divide us.  Never before have I ever heard a president look down on a blue state or a red state or call people that don't have the same ideals as radical  https://t.co/ZdyP48RqGb have no hame in your game.
1321105913755873282 2020-10-27 23:06:09 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realKevinLeleu @TeamTrump Kevin, thank you.  I think that is why I have so much tunnel vision.  I can not see past the loss. Again, thank you so much for your kind words. It is people like you that I admire because we may not agree on everything but in the end we are all Americans.
1321104410316021760 2020-10-27 23:00:11 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump How is that going with covid.  He has lied and has done nothing to keep us safe.  He is the super spreader.  Shame on you dear.
1321104045482909696 2020-10-27 22:58:44 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump @MSNBC You knew about this virus and chose to lie to us and did nothing.  You still lie and do nothing.
1321102837275832326 2020-10-27 22:53:55 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump I had friend's living in the tRump buildings in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn and I can say those  building were dumps.  He and his daddy were slum lords.
1321101983294590982 2020-10-27 22:50:32 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realKevinLeleu @TeamTrump That is really wonderful.  Most front line  workers are amazing.  My point is that he knew in Jan., 2020 about this virus and did nothing and told no one.   I lost a 14 year old nephew in mid March due to covid. He had an obligation to us.
1321099877422637056 2020-10-27 22:42:10 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TaraLV_7451 @TeamTrump I am so sorry to hear that.  It is horrific that on top of all of this suffering we have to be terrified to have our insurance taken away.
1321099549235183618 2020-10-27 22:40:52 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @AshleyLovely85 @TeamTrump I will not even justify myself because your comment is really stupid.  Good luck to ya
1321099183227572225 2020-10-27 22:39:24 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @American_Gigi @texanforev @TeamTrump To me who is a republican I do not put party before family or country.  We are all in this together.  This disease is deadly and we have to all have each other's back.  My neighbor is a Bernie fan and another a tRump fan.  Does not matter to me and we all do for each other.
1321097643163111425 2020-10-27 22:33:17 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @American_Gigi @TeamTrump I agree.  He can spin it all he wants and I will not believe his horseshit.  Although, he has come through now and I will take that over tRump lying each and everyday to us.  He knew this was deadly, he knew this was transmitted through the air and did nothing.
1321096835121975297 2020-10-27 22:30:04 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TYJFYM @TeamTrump You see that is a fucked up attitude.  We all should be united and not divided.  The division is tearing this country apart because of fucked up thinkinglike yours.
1321096507395874818 2020-10-27 22:28:46 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @chester_burl @bravoaddict3 @MercifulCathol1 @TeamTrump I find that they can not prove you wrong but will blame it on Fake news or  the deep state thing.  Common sense isn't so common when it comes to his followers.
1321096122635530241 2020-10-27 22:27:15 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @American_Gigi @TeamTrump Think back....people were coming and going to Europe and we did not know anything about his virus, but tRump did.  We have JFK, Newark, LaGuardia and a few  smaller airports.  tRump did not stop grave until March 13th at 12 am.  By then it was too late.
1321095548699594753 2020-10-27 22:24:58 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @American_Gigi @TeamTrump I voted for him and supported him up until covid.  He knew about this deadly disease and did not tell us.  I lost 3 family  members in mid March and early April.  My nephew was only 14 and his death could have been avoided if we knew the truth
1321094528451940352 2020-10-27 22:20:54 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @texanforev @American_Gigi @TeamTrump I know we are in a very populated area and I lost a nephew 14, a cousin 48 and an aunt 76 t covid.  We needed to be told the truth early on and not lied to.
1321094085185331202 2020-10-27 22:19:09 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @SuperComicFun @TeamTrump Yeah, a man bragging to grab women by the "blank" is a class act.
1321093886899556355 2020-10-27 22:18:22 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DrWrunakas @TeamTrump Of course, but I live in a populated area and have lost 3 family members since March to Covid.  My nephew was 14, my cousin was 48 and my aunt was 76.
1321093509487755266 2020-10-27 22:16:52 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @chester_burl @MercifulCathol1 @TeamTrump I boggles my mind that people take what he will say at face value without even fact checking.
1321093006410264581 2020-10-27 22:14:52 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @chester_burl @MercifulCathol1 @TeamTrump I do blame him.  It scares me that people still listen to him and still do not take this virus serious.  That is why when he says that he had the best economy I want to puke.  So much suffering going on out there
1321091309034217472 2020-10-27 22:08:07 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @chester_burl @MercifulCathol1 @TeamTrump I am mostly speaking as a mom and his handling of covid is disturbing.  I live in a very populated area so I understand numbers will be high, but we lost 3 family members in 8 months because of covid.
1321087594575417345 2020-10-27 21:53:21 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump That is 3% up more then the hookers you have been with
1321087270552772613 2020-10-27 21:52:04 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @American_Gigi @TeamTrump I can see how well the building of that wall is going.  Ironic that Mexico will not allow us there because of the raging covid.
1321086809397465088 2020-10-27 21:50:14 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @American_Gigi @TeamTrump Cuomo is doing an amazing job with covid.  My family and I did not vote for him and are Republicans but he is a smart man.  Don the Con on the other hand is dumb as a box of rocks.

1320810791315144707 2020-10-27 03:33:26 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @atrupar He is a creep.
1320810349411635200 2020-10-27 03:31:41 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JoeNBC He and the rest of the clan sickens me to my very core.
1320810154078707713 2020-10-27 03:30:54 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TeamTrump You are a big mouth coward and the world knows it.

1320807372336582656 2020-10-27 03:19:51 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @HillaryClinton @TheDemCoalition Dear God, this has been a haunting nightmare for so many.  I am hoping that one day our grandkids can say that this country is great and he will be erased from our thoughts.
1320806845221580802 2020-10-27 03:17:45 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @mmpadellan There are no words for what I am feeling right now.  Well, at least I can't express it on twitter.  The killer clown and his posse sickens my soul
1320806499493597184 2020-10-27 03:16:23 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump The world sees who you really are.
1320806333201948680 2020-10-27 03:15:43 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 I just talked with an old friend who remembers "shoot the freak".  He who is a big tRump fan said it did remind him of days gone on Coney Island.  I want us to concentrate on what unites us and not divides us.
1320768840993804289 2020-10-27 00:46:45 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TheRickWilson Like the coward he is he can only use his platform to spew his nonsense.  He knows he is stupid and can not spar with you.
1320767858129969153 2020-10-27 00:42:50 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @EllenBarkin What astounds me is that woman I have spoken to think that is ok for hi to speak that way.
1320767427240710150 2020-10-27 00:41:07 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TeamTrump The world sees you and your clan members for what you really are.  Your con is over.
1320767226086100994 2020-10-27 00:40:20 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Mike_Pence Spreading more death I see.  The world knows you have already lost this election and they are laughing at you.
1320764133403480066 2020-10-27 00:28:02 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 This just proves to me that they are all pieces of garbage who are vindictive.  There is a saying "the weaker the man, the stronger the prey" and this just tells me all I need to know about how weak they are.  They preyed on someone's son who has lost gone through so much trauma.
1320762970306187265 2020-10-27 00:23:25 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 I am not sure if I was Biden's son and loosing my mom and sister where he and his brother almost died as well in a  horrific car accident I probably would be a basket case.  Also, his brother then did pass away from cancer.  There is so much loss and grief.
1320762518697115651 2020-10-27 00:21:37 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 Steve Bannon in my eyes is a major slime ball.  It isckened me how low down and dirty people can get.  First of all, as a parent kids at any age are off limits.  Secondly, I wish I can say we are all perfect but the truth is addiction and depression is very real.
1320680869389021184 2020-10-26 18:57:10 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @YouTube I respect your opinion.  I wish I could say the same here.  The man terrifies me.  I think he is unhinged and desperate.  Nothing worse then a cornered rat.
1320680366055763968 2020-10-26 18:55:10 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @YouTube Common sense which isn't so common.We have a restaurant around the corner from us and they have had covid parties.  You can hear them cheering in the parking lot.  They don't believe this virus is real and the asshole owner promotes this.  That is what I mean by common sense.
1320678252986466305 2020-10-26 18:46:47 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @YouTube Yes, I know.  It is  just that there is so much we still do not know about this virus and my choices for my son can have serious consequences  and that is a heavy load t carry.  I would rather be over cautious at this point.
1320677519201390592 2020-10-26 18:43:52 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @YouTube I will also mention that I thought tRump was an asshole way back in the 80's.  I had a few friends living in his Trump apartment  buildings in Brighton Beach  in Brooklyn and the halls had mice and roaches.  He was a slum lord and just couldn't stand him then.
1320676394104463364 2020-10-26 18:39:23 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @YouTube I have always respected cops.   They put their lives on the line and that is something that I could never do.  I admit I do not have the gumption nor the character to do what they do.
1320675745358819330 2020-10-26 18:36:49 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @YouTube Coney Island was quite the experience.  I have seen junkies, homeless people, rats the size of puppies so I get what you are saying.  Things need to change and I just don't think tRump is up for it.  He had a life of privilege and his reality is not most people's reality.
1320674138588094465 2020-10-26 18:30:26 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @YouTube It took 7 days for the two children at my son's school to get an answer that they tested positive for covid.  I am sick for their families and sick for the teachers an their families.  In those 7 days s many more people probably has gotten infected.
1320673546759229441 2020-10-26 18:28:05 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @YouTube Oh yes!!!  That was a big deal for us growing up there.  But that was a game and this is real life.  I just see those two as freakish clowns.  I am so pissed about this pandemic that I will admit I have tunnel vision.
1320672099430735874 2020-10-26 18:22:20 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @YouTube Years ago on Coney Island they had something that was called "shoot the freak".  If you look it up that is how I picture tRump and Rudy handling things in this country.
1320669415545995266 2020-10-26 18:11:40 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @YouTube Simon, I not a betting person.  I am also not a fan of Biden either.  It is just that tRump is a liar and just with how he has mishandled this pandemic I am sick to my stomach.  At least Rudy may be able to sell knishes on the boardwalk but tRump is not even capable of that.
1320668263706095617 2020-10-26 18:07:05 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @YouTube My problem with tRump he talks tough but in the end he is  just a coward. It is the military, the front line workers, the cops that deserve respect.  He gets shit from me.  I have seen assholes like him before and they either end up dead or in jail.  He is a punk.
1320665996277985280 2020-10-26 17:58:04 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @YouTube That is why I am not president because I don't have any class much like tRump.  We need a strong leader who has empathy and will pull us together instead of dividing us.  He is weak and a coward.  I can say I probably took more punches then he has.  He is all talk and no action.
1320663485915779072 2020-10-26 17:48:06 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @YouTube When I saw Rudy laugh and called people animals it just told me how not qualified he is to deal with the public. It was total provocation. Maybe he should get a job at the Coney Island freak show.  That is more his speed, or selling knishes on the boardwalk.
1320662867524362241 2020-10-26 17:45:39 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @YouTube I did see one instigator who did disgust me and some feeble minded idiots followed.  I do no take sides.  Violent acts on either side is not acceptable.  tRumps clan (rudy) just laughed in one of the videos and called the people animals.
1320661329464696833 2020-10-26 17:39:32 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @YouTube I hate any kind of violence.  Never in my lifetime do I remember a president that pits red states against blue states.  This is how he divides us.  We are all humans and Americans.
1320648388438855680 2020-10-26 16:48:06 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @YouTube The division that the trump clan is creating is sickening.  We are all of different races and creed and instead of uniting us they just try to divide and conquer.  Rudy is tRump's bitch plain and simple.
1320647636886704129 2020-10-26 16:45:07 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @YouTube I am an Italian American and I can say that he is a disgrace.  Most of my family and friends came from Italy and they can not stand him. This country was built on many cultures and races and he has sold his black soul to the devil.  He is a dirty dealer.

I have to drive through there and could not because of all the nonsense.  It is simple, wear the damn mask and follow some rules.  This is a  matter of life and death.
1320580056343810048 2020-10-26 12:16:35 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @mmpadellan I try to be pen minded and I will say because I live in Brooklyn that what went on in the Jewish community was not called for.  I hate wearing a mask but if it means keeping people safe and just wear the damn thing.

1320559395802152965 2020-10-26 10:54:29 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @jawillick @DonaldJTrumpJr Jesus Christ, imagine if daddy and the rest of your clan got fact checked.  Your clan are liars and the world knows it.
1320557412051488768 2020-10-26 10:46:36 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @GeorgeTakei Just when I thought I couldn't get any more disgusted with trump and his clan something more screwed up happens.
1320556952435462147 2020-10-26 10:44:46 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @RadioFreeTom I have many friends and relatives on Staten Island and I can say first hand that they are not liked at all and would not get such a warm welcome.  Only a few lunatics still want that Koolaid.
1320556292927332353 2020-10-26 10:42:09 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @meiselasb The killer clown is afraid of strong intelligent women.

I could have sworn that the pages were blank, just like the blank piece of paper he pretended to sign when he was sick.
1320555062964424705 2020-10-26 10:37:16 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump @cindyhydesmith The world is laughing at you.  Putin made it very clear that you are no longer his useful idiot anymore.
1320554384871358465 2020-10-26 10:34:34 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr The world is laughing at you.  Even Putin knows that daddy isn't his useful idiot anymore.  Daddy is just an idiot.
1320553955261247489 2020-10-26 10:32:52 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @AdamParkhomenko There is no doubt in my mind that Pence had to change tRumps diaper.

All he could say was "it is what it is" about all the  https://t.co/yv38tdEWkz my eyes he has a black soul.

This little boy got violently ill in school and there was mass panic with the students.  Many kids have had to have counseling and a lot of us parents and teachers as well.

My son's school notified us tonight that two students tested positive and the school will be closed for now.  This roller coaster deadly ride is taking a toll on everyone.

1320518656489594885 2020-10-26 08:12:36 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Rosie The killer clown should not be given anymore air time.
1320507273022709762 2020-10-26 07:27:22 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @thehill @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Killer clown needs no costume.
1320491387297714176 2020-10-26 06:24:14 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump David, I voted for the killer clown also.  Here is hoping to a great turn out for Biden so that we can all finally get some sleep.
1320485186371522561 2020-10-26 05:59:36 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @WHNSC By the way buddy boy, I have managed to have family and friends from Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island vote for Biden.  Somehow people don't like killer clowns for presidents.  Go figure.
1320484788931878913 2020-10-26 05:58:01 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @WHNSC The world is laughing at you .
1320484278434713600 2020-10-26 05:56:00 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TeaPainUSA The killer clown  stated that covid attacks mostly seniors with heart conditions.  I guess that is why the piece of shit didn't die when he had covid, because he doesn't have a heart.
1320483732483133442 2020-10-26 05:53:49 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @IvankaTrump Yes, good christians your clan members are.  I am sure all the souls lost to covid and their families would agree that your clan members are pieces of shit
1320482020712194048 2020-10-26 05:47:01 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump You are a clown and the world knows it.  Your boy Putin basically made it clear that you are an asshole.
1320481804697088001 2020-10-26 05:46:10 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @briantylercohen I think Putin is returning his rabid puppy back to the pound.
1320481214680174593 2020-10-26 05:43:49 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump The killer clown and his clan are at it again.
1320466422326321153 2020-10-26 04:45:02 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TheDemCoalition @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump Now there is a man with character!!!
1320466158525534210 2020-10-26 04:43:59 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @briantylercohen thank goodness four family members came to their senses.    tRump could not put a spin on this deadly virus and unfortunately it hit home for our family
1320457770907406336 2020-10-26 04:10:40 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @EricTrump That is a death trap.  You guys are assholes.
1320432000625483776 2020-10-26 02:28:16 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr Your clan are all con artists
1320424821134643201 2020-10-26 01:59:44 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @IvankaTrump Your clan are a bunch of fucking cons
1320422834347364361 2020-10-26 01:51:50 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Amy_Siskind The world laughs at him and yet he has no shame in his game.
1320422216442531843 2020-10-26 01:49:23 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @meiselasb Amazing, she can be on camera and still keep her clothes on.  Melania's claim to fame is her porn shots and marrying a killer clown
1320421492895735808 2020-10-26 01:46:30 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @mmpadellan This is plain out murder.  That whole clan needs jail time.
1320421278998822918 2020-10-26 01:45:39 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @AdamParkhomenko If you mean mentally then the answer is a def. yes!
1320421025377562627 2020-10-26 01:44:39 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @itsJeffTiedrich I am sure "mother" won't get close to that shithead either.  He makes my skin crawl
1320420704001642496 2020-10-26 01:43:22 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @MeidasTouch The whole tRump clan are homicidal maniacs.
1320420280846716930 2020-10-26 01:41:41 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @BillKristol There are no words to describe these pieces of garbage.  When they are gone my home wil never speak of them again.
1320347310522572800 2020-10-25 20:51:44 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump @SeanParnellUSA @TheJusticeDept He is stupid and a lunatic.  That makes him scary as hell.  That shithead has got to go.
1320346758921265152 2020-10-25 20:49:32 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @BenjaminPD23 @simonTh81904985 Was the porn star who was paid $130,000 for sale????
1320346450811867136 2020-10-25 20:48:19 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @funder @TheRickWilson Rick, my family are huge fans of you and The Lincoln Project.  We are all republicans but we know a con artist lunatic every time the shithead opens his mouth
1320344897099042817 2020-10-25 20:42:08 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @RudyGiuliani @simonTh81904985 This coming from a pervert who was just fixing his shirt.  What the fuck happened to you.  I am a New Yorker and was proud of you at one time.  Now you just disgust me.
1320344490197061632 2020-10-25 20:40:31 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @HerschelWalker @DonaldJTrumpJr @JoeBiden Actually chump is being way to kind.  I have other choice words but for public reading I will just call your clan cons, grifters and shitheads
1320343429004611589 2020-10-25 20:36:18 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @1776Stonewall @simonTh81904985 Thanks for the heads up.  I will let all my family and friends who live there to shop somewhere else.
1320342808675389440 2020-10-25 20:33:51 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr How the fuck would you like  it if people went after you or your kids.  Your clan is such a disgrace and the world knows it.
1320342488125681664 2020-10-25 20:32:34 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @KellyannePolls @DonaldJTrumpJr @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @Forbes @AOC @SenSanders @SenWarren So Don the Con isn't liked by many around the world.  What a shocker.  I wouldn't give him a wooden nickel.   Junior, if you were smart (which we know you are not) get out while you still can.  Your lunatic father acting like a cornered rat.
1320341457279111170 2020-10-25 20:28:28 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 We as a nation have a lot of work ahead of us and a lot of healing.  I would just like to start with having not so many people die from covid because of misinformation and then we can right a lot of wrongs.
1320339396370026497 2020-10-25 20:20:17 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @J_Mei21 I guess stupidity is hereditary.
1320337905001336832 2020-10-25 20:14:21 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @MeidasTouch @joncoopertweets He is so hateful.  Such a sick POS.
1320337172931727361 2020-10-25 20:11:27 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @B52Malmet Same here.  My son's grandmother is 92 and it breaks my heart that our loved ones are deprived. of being with one another.  So much hurt and suffering because of him.  I loathe that lunatic sociopath.
1320321563669954566 2020-10-25 19:09:25 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @RealJamesWoods @winsorharmon I guess a president that pays $130,000 to shut up a porn star is a class act to you.  Obviously the 220,000 souls dying on his watch doesn't matter.  You probably admire a man who pays off porn stars.  I am sure you have been there as well.
1320320786603933696 2020-10-25 19:06:20 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @SwissTriple_M @joncoopertweets Don't know if I want to laugh or cry.  They are lunatics
1320320232683163648 2020-10-25 19:04:08 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 Antifa, the KKK, the proud boys  and such are all lunatics.  Things are so out of control.  The video of those people agitating that woman was very sad.  Provocation can lead to some pretty serious problems.
1320313423658364929 2020-10-25 18:37:05 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @SwissTriple_M I am a Brooklynite and those people make me proud!
1320312838603288582 2020-10-25 18:34:45 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 Sad times.  I agreed with her but she did put hands on another person.

1320262725893849089 2020-10-25 15:15:37 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @thehill So glad he is leading the covid task force.
1320247021798854656 2020-10-25 14:13:13 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @RealJamesWoods @simonTh81904985 Shouldn't you be working or something  like that???
1320246129997512704 2020-10-25 14:09:41 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 I thought so.  You do seem to be a gentleman
1320243752972201985 2020-10-25 14:00:14 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @meiselasb Well that was not nice to say to me.
1320238510989856768 2020-10-25 13:39:24 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @TheRickWilson Just when I thought he couldn't sound more stupid but he goes and out does himself again
1320237369086431232 2020-10-25 13:34:52 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 he def. needs charm school and maybe a shock collar
1320201804093718528 2020-10-25 11:13:32 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 The video makes sense,  Maybe he really wasn't mocking the man.  One thing he can not back peddle from is when he bragged about grabbing woman by the "blank".  He to me is a pig.  Oh, wait that is what he called  Rosie O'Donnel.  He def. needs charm school.
1320197600872640512 2020-10-25 10:56:50 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 I would not do that.  You are actually a very intelligent person and we may not agree on things, but that is what makes this country great.  Ok, maybe not the rats the size of puppies but all the rest is ok.
1320197278049718273 2020-10-25 10:55:33 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 He was on national tv making fun at a reporter with a disability.  As fr Cruz, tRump called his wife ugly and said that Cruz's father had a hand in killing Kennedy.   The guy is nuts.  Man Woman Person Camera TV.
1320196746203586560 2020-10-25 10:53:27 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 Scary but I live on Coney Island in NYC and most of that crap has already happened.  We have rats the size of puppies.  I actually have a emergency to go bag and have friends upstate in the woods and that is my escape plan.
1320196234934689792 2020-10-25 10:51:25 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @tonyjones435 @simonTh81904985 My thoughts exactly.
1320193223873171457 2020-10-25 10:39:27 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 Although I see tRump as a little man who makes fun at people with disabilities and people with addiction problems.  Disgraceful.
1320192409570054144 2020-10-25 10:36:13 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 I think he mentioned he wants more park rangers.  He may have been watching to much of Yogi bear and BooBoo
1320192089750110208 2020-10-25 10:34:56 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 I think they are leaving because the whole friggin state is burning.  tRump had an obligation of 60% to manage the forest.  Although on national tv he said he does not believe in science nor climate change.
1320191437858897920 2020-10-25 10:32:21 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 His golfing alone more then covers his salary.  But hey nothing like a man inn power wearing diapers and sucks at his golf swing
1320190333901262848 2020-10-25 10:27:58 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @itsJeffTiedrich @bees_marty The diaper probably got stuck up his ass
1320189745989931009 2020-10-25 10:25:38 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr Didn't your daddy call his son a coke head at the debate.  Let's not talk crass junior.
1320189383358763009 2020-10-25 10:24:11 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 Knowing some things now it is horrific.  I feel for future generations.
1320188270014287873 2020-10-25 10:19:46 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> They are garbage and showed not one ounce of compassion
1320187855164067840 2020-10-25 10:18:07 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 I was not on Twitter then.  If I were I probably would have tweeted, but not rage tweet.  Trust me I am a lady and what comes out f my mouth would not be proper in print
1320187198415712259 2020-10-25 10:15:30 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 Honestly, I would have vote for Joe Exotic if he weren't in jail.  Let's face it they are all crooks
1320186618842697729 2020-10-25 10:13:12 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 People die everyday but this virus could have been preventable.
1320184970841829377 2020-10-25 10:06:39 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @RobinSMessing @ReallyAmerican1 I guess it didn't effect tRump much because he does not have a heart
1320179918353977345 2020-10-25 09:46:34 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 Sadly, yes peple did die of the Swine flu.  Although, if you look and see it was around 13,000 deaths in one year.  This covid has killed 220,000 since March!!!  Any death is sad, but this is something horror movies are made of.  Sadly still close to 1000 are still dying everyday
1320179406523011072 2020-10-25 09:44:32 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @killgoardamus @No1Trump2020 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Exactly!!!  That is why I am astounded that tRump didn't take action with travel to and fro Europe until March 13th at 12 am.
1320179131393466369 2020-10-25 09:43:27 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @JordanSchachtel @DonaldJTrumpJr Ok, maybe a little hypocritical but as a woman he is cute so I will give him pass.  Just kidding.  The rules should apply to everyone.  I am a big supporter of those damn masks
1320178485491531781 2020-10-25 09:40:53 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump Hells yeah!!!  My nephew was 14 years old and passed due to this virus.  None of us knew about it and we all went about our business.  tRump is a public servant and had a duty to be straight with us.  Nothing will every change my mind on him.
1320178026609520642 2020-10-25 09:39:03 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @KamalaHarris Yes, Obama did have those stupid cages.  Although, the children were put there when their parents had court appearances.  The parents were slapped with minor charge charge and then the families were united.  tRump tk it to the very extreme.
1320177400215457792 2020-10-25 09:36:34 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @JordanSchachtel @DonaldJTrumpJr Of course, I agree with that.  Also, it was March 12th or 13th that most places closed down.  In Feb., 2020 I remember people speaking of this virus but none of us had a clue a to how deadly this was.  tRump should told us the truth.  Although I don't think he knows what truth is
1320168518566973440 2020-10-25 09:01:17 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @killgoardamus @No1Trump2020 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Not tying to change anyone's opinion.  I personally can not stand tRump.
1320168274282369024 2020-10-25 09:00:18 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @JordanSchachtel @DonaldJTrumpJr Oh, you mean Gulliani???  The guy is a creep.  I would not want to be in a dark ally with him.
1320168017314152450 2020-10-25 08:59:17 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @RyanPeter502 @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr None of us knew how deadly this virus was and that it was transmitted through the air.  tRump knew and chose not to tell us.  Listen to the Woodward tapes.  Asshole just can't help himself.
1320167622080712706 2020-10-25 08:57:43 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @BlindedByLyrics @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr Look at India.  They have well over a billion people and their death rate is much lower then us.  tRum lied to us.  Scary when idiot boy still wants to build the wall and Mexico does not want us going there.  Do you see the irony???
1320167181125095426 2020-10-25 08:55:58 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump The idiot spends more on golf so how can you say he "funded" our military.  You and I and other tax payers have funded our military.  tRump has not paid taxes and is a draft dodger.  I think he dodged the draft 5 times because of bone spurs.  He is a loser and a coward.
1320166686570545159 2020-10-25 08:54:00 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @ThereWiIlbBlood @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr Do you actually do yur homework????  Have you not listened to the Woodward recordings.  In Jan., 2020 China knew and alerted tRump.  He bragged that he was in the know and he and i were just on the phone speaking of this virus.  Please, do not listen to him.  He is a con.
1320166170335608840 2020-10-25 08:51:57 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @ThereWiIlbBlood @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr No one knew in Jan., 2020 how deadly this virus was.  tRump himself admitted it on the Woodward recordings.  He bragged that he was in the know.  He is beyond shameful.  I am trying to be a lady but you get the drift.
1320165679325171712 2020-10-25 08:50:00 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @ThereWiIlbBlood @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr I am a Republican but I put my family and my country before party.  Yes, there should be a deal made.  So many people are hurting in so many ways,  It is heartbreaking.
1320165377507315713 2020-10-25 08:48:48 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump I did and regret that decision.  I knew he was crude but I never pegged him to be a murderer.
1320165150574497792 2020-10-25 08:47:54 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @JordanSchachtel @DonaldJTrumpJr i normally would agree but this could have been somewhat prevented had tRup told us the truth.  I am a firm believer in social distancing and masks.  Trust me I am freaking out because I miss my lady friends and our dinner nights but I think keeping my son alive is key
1320164576017731589 2020-10-25 08:45:37 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @JordanSchachtel @DonaldJTrumpJr Funny, because he takes medical advice from Fox news.  He has often said that is his go to.  The man is a moron who suggested we ingest disinfectant to cure this virus.  I think that is very telling.  Don't you agree???
1320164001779748865 2020-10-25 08:43:20 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @BlindedByLyrics @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr He knew back in Jan., 2020 and did not ban flights to and from Europe until March 13th at 12 am.  He only put restrictions on China.  Please, do your homework and don't listen to him.  The guy is stupid and a con man.
1320163612271497216 2020-10-25 08:41:47 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump I am sorry but kids are off limits.  tRump and his clan are dirty dealers.  So much could be said about his clan but why fight dirty.  He is a desperate little man
1320163211484737538 2020-10-25 08:40:11 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump tRump knew way back in Jan., 2020 and said nothing.  It is simple...social distance and mask up.  We don't need scientists to pound it into our brains.
1320162896115126278 2020-10-25 08:38:56 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump The topic of abortion is very emotional.  With that aside don't you think by tRump not telling us about this deadly virus that he murdered all those people.  So how is that so different then the abortion that you oppose???
1320162319842803712 2020-10-25 08:36:39 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump He hasn't fought for anything in his whole life.  He is a coward who dodged the draft.  He knew how deadly this disease was and chose not to tell us.  The people who died suffered and could not even had a chance to hold their loved ones hands.  The guy is a monster.
1320161807194066944 2020-10-25 08:34:36 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @BlindedByLyrics @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr Did you listen to the Woodward recordings???  tRump himself admitted he told Woodward and also was briefed 5 times about this deadly virus.  Look up Woodward and listen to tRump in his own words.
1320161202820030464 2020-10-25 08:32:12 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump Maybe she would have told us to social distance and mask up.  There is no excuse for tRump the liar.  He knew fr months how deadly this virus was and never said anything to us.  When he looses I hope his fat ass goes to jail.
1320160838649511937 2020-10-25 08:30:45 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @BlindedByLyrics @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr I am sure Biden would have encouraged social distancing and mask wearing.  My son was in school and than God this hasn't effected kids as much.  He had a duty to tell us and to keep our families safe.  He is a coward.
1320160345969856512 2020-10-25 08:28:48 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Joseph19147 @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr No one knew how deadly  this virus was and that it was transmitted through the air.  My son was in school until mid March all the while jerk off knew about  this virus for months.  To me he is a coward and a murderer.
1320159665330802688 2020-10-25 08:26:06 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Joseph19147 @ThereWiIlbBlood @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr My  story is straight.  Asshole knew the virus was deadly and was air borne and said nothing to any of us.  He is a murderer in my eyes.    If he told us so many lives would have been saved.  He is a piece of shit.
1320159142523305985 2020-10-25 08:24:01 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @KamalaHarris In my eyes tRum is a monster.  He does not care abut the thousands who have died on his watch with covid.  He does not care about the little kids in cages and still have not been reunited with their families.  Hopfully he will be in a cage soon with Bubba as his cellmate.
1320158439402819585 2020-10-25 08:21:13 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @KamalaHarris I agree.  I have not gone out for 8 months except for essentials and my son is home schooled now.  People need to take this serious because this virus does not care what party you are.
1320157989035298816 2020-10-25 08:19:26 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @ThereWiIlbBlood @Joseph19147 @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr I guess to you that is far worse then putting little children in cages.  Hundreds of children still are not with their moms.  Anyone who does that is a monster and a coward.
1319821978866536448 2020-10-24 10:04:15 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JoyAnnReid As per tRump...they seem ilke very fine people.

I must say their hats are very white and bright.  I can not even get my socks that white.  They get a A+ or laundry skills.
1318736630803476482 2020-10-21 10:11:28 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @ThereWiIlbBlood @Joseph19147 @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr I am not looking to argue.  We can agree to disagree.  You feel one way and I feel another.  That is why we are free Americans with our own thoughts and minds.  I titally repect your ideas.
1318736248207441921 2020-10-21 10:09:57 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @KamalaHarris That is why it is a pleasure to speak with you.  We can not all think alike and that is what makes this country great.
1318735955906396160 2020-10-21 10:08:47 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @itsJeffTiedrich Crazy when I speak to people and they think he is a tough talking guy.  All I see is a coward who dodged the draft and hides in a bunker.  I am a woman and I think I took more shots to the face then him.
1318717108235231233 2020-10-21 08:53:53 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @KamalaHarris It is a personal choice no doubt.  We live in NYC and my family avoids crowds.  Just look at what happened at the Rose Garden.  To each his own.  I am a single mother and an attorney and my children's safety come before anything.
1318623450475487235 2020-10-21 02:41:44 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Joseph19147 @ThereWiIlbBlood @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr SO then go out without a mask, pack in like sardines and then tell me how your theory is correct???? But if you want to drink the Kooaid and follow the rest off the cliff that is your choice.  My 14 year old nephew who suffered did not have a choice.
1318622538889658370 2020-10-21 02:38:06 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Joseph19147 @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr This bad flu season is deadly and people die alone without their family members.  My 14 year old nephew died alone with out his mother holding his hand.  Now tell me your asshole sham of statistics because our family lived it.
1318621727841308680 2020-10-21 02:34:53 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Joseph19147 @ThereWiIlbBlood @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr My story is straight.  My nephew was not in a nursing home, my aunt was not in a nursing home and my cousin wh was a journalist or the NY post was in a nursing home.   Get your facts straight.  You can listen to bullshit but my family lived it.  I pity the poorly educated.
1318621100138528769 2020-10-21 02:32:23 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonnaLeanneGwin This virus spreads like wild fire.  I am in NYC and see how fast it spreads.  Dispute me on that one.

1317960930572062722 2020-10-19 06:49:07 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @BlindedByLyrics @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr His recording with Bob Woodward  admitting he knew this was carried through the air and 5 times more deadly then you average virus. Navarro said that he was briefed 5 times in Jan. and did nothing.
1317959993228972033 2020-10-19 06:45:23 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump Actually I am not torn.  Anti abortion beliefs I respect.  215,000 souls dying and they are claiming to be pro life I do not respect.
1317959543868018688 2020-10-19 06:43:36 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @MeidasTouch She is an entitled pos!!!  No shame in her game.
1317959053956579328 2020-10-19 06:41:39 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DrEricDing @MeidasTouch Disgraceful.  There is no shame in his game.
1317958618994585600 2020-10-19 06:39:55 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump I just feel if he fought for American he would not have dodged the draft 5 times.  Many in my family fought world war ll and one uncle never came back.  My two uncles fought in Nam and never have been the same since.  I have no respect for a draft dodger.
1317958091258892289 2020-10-19 06:37:50 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DebraMessing Another super spreader event.
1317957582020104197 2020-10-19 06:35:48 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump You as well.  Stay safe.
1317956071886114816 2020-10-19 06:29:48 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump I am far from liberal but the man is a walking contradiction.  I do not respect how he dodged the draft 5 times and has not paid his fair share of taxes.  We can agree to disagree and that is why we are in the greatest country in the world.
1317955446532079617 2020-10-19 06:27:19 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump I just don't think he tries to unite us, just divide us.  No other President has pitted Dems against Republican the way  he has.  We need to be united and not divided.
1317954639334092800 2020-10-19 06:24:07 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump I am a Republican but can not vote for tRump.  I look at the character of the man and not by his party.
1317952875813797889 2020-10-19 06:17:06 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @AngrierWHStaff Rudy is a crackpot.
1317952496413872128 2020-10-19 06:15:36 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @MeidasTouch I feel he is dancing upon the graves of those wh have suffered.
1317952377824120833 2020-10-19 06:15:07 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @thehill He isn't even a good reality showman.  Maybe a clown, but that is about it.
1317952070029369346 2020-10-19 06:13:54 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @HarveyWilms Greeting to you and Australia.  We are before anything else humans and all want the best for our families.
1317951833885782020 2020-10-19 06:12:58 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump I am a woman and abortion is such a heart wrenching topic.  My fear is that if it is abolished there will be so many back ally abortions and many woman can and will die.  we are faced with so many human issues and that is why fighting will not solve anything.  Unity will prevail

1317948527767674882 2020-10-19 05:59:49 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump I meant to type "united" not untied.  My typing skills suck.
1317948323257634818 2020-10-19 05:59:01 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @MollyJongFast I couldn't agree more.  All this fighting is not doing our country any good.  The division that tRump is creating is very damaging.
1317947948832088067 2020-10-19 05:57:31 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump I am not on a team.  My feelings is that divided we will loose, but untied we can be a force.
1317947589266898946 2020-10-19 05:56:06 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump I agree.  The information keeps on changing and it makes one's head spin.  All I can do is what I think is best for my family.  I pray everyone stays safe.
1317947260609662976 2020-10-19 05:54:47 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump I am actually a Republican.  My goal is to put family and country above party.  We are all in this together.  We are all Americans.
1317941331516338176 2020-10-19 05:31:14 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump Further more I am not about fighting.  We are all in this together.  We can disagree on a candidate, but in the end we are all Americans and just want our families to be safe.
1317941139178139648 2020-10-19 05:30:28 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump I don't have feelings when it comes to this shit.  My skin is tough.  I just do not like a President that should have told us the truth about this deadly virus from the start.
1317940263466184706 2020-10-19 05:26:59 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @BlindedByLyrics @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr He knew about this virus in Jan., 2020 and did not close travel to and from Europe until March 13th at 12am.  So many more lives could have been saved.

1317932387460915200 2020-10-19 04:55:41 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonaldJTrumpJr What about covid????  Instead of dividing all of us let's make a plan and beat this virus, shit head.

Look, we are not enemies but fellow Americans and I do not look at anyone's party because this deadly disease does not discriminate.  We as Americans can not divide if we want to conquer this virus.
1317931621698469888 2020-10-19 04:52:39 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump Sadly, it is true.  I did vote for the clown.  I am not proud of it.  I should have done my homework but I didn't.

This virus is deadly and I don't think we will ever fully recover.  I hope I am wrong as I have been so many other times.  Mostly I was wrong when I voted for tRump.

1317902026421010434 2020-10-19 02:55:03 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @mmpadellan It is still early.  Maybe he will be struck down by lightning before sun down.

1317898476009783296 2020-10-19 02:40:56 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Lol72064102 @TeamTrump @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump Agreed!!!  When I see the death numbers still rising it is scary.  I pray that people stay safe and this country can heal.

1317897186089238533 2020-10-19 02:35:49 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @fred_guttenberg @JoeBiden I pray everyday for this guy to get the hell out of the people's house.  He has squatted long enough.
1317896881549332481 2020-10-19 02:34:36 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @realDonaldTrump What is your plan for covid???  Right you don't have one.  Go take a nap.
1317894873970839555 2020-10-19 02:26:37 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Lol72064102 @TeamTrump @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump I agree about China.  Although, again tRump lied to us also.  He still continues to do so.  Instead of addressing the issue he just slams Biden's son.  He called Biden's son a coke head at the debate.  To me tRump is trash and must be thrown out.
1317894146527514625 2020-10-19 02:23:44 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump In my eyes he has not paid taxes so I do not consider him as funding our military.  He dodged the draft 5 times as well.  He is a cheat and he is weak.
1317893800883310593 2020-10-19 02:22:22 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump He and his family are attacking Joe Biden's son and it sickens my stomach.  He is as low as they go.

1317891158501167109 2020-10-19 02:11:52 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @BorisEP @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Another super spreader.

1317890109686108161 2020-10-19 02:07:42 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @NYinLA2121 Where to begin???  He is stupid beyond words. I  am Italian and I am not a fan of Kristofour.  This idiot has got to go!

1317889332473192449 2020-10-19 02:04:36 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @StephenKing He is a racist.  He is homophobic.  He is a liar.  He is a murderer.
1317888565083312131 2020-10-19 02:01:33 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @ProjectLincoln Gotta love the hair!!!  I wonder if they have Aquanet in prison?

Instead tRump pretends that it is nothing to worry about.  My nephew at 14 years old passed away from this virus and I tend to believe the doctors and not some failed reality show asshole.
1317886269108736001 2020-10-19 01:52:26 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @DonnaLeanneGwin Great, more super spreaders.  Haven't enough people died already???
1317886050019278850 2020-10-19 01:51:34 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @JohnBooks13 @TeamTrump He does not address anything that would keep us safe.  He only knows how to degrade people's children.  I voted for him last time but he is a low down dirty player when yu attack people's children.
1317885554533502977 2020-10-19 01:49:35 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @simonTh81904985 @JordanSchachtel @DonaldJTrumpJr I agree.  I just know what this deadly virus took from my family. It was here and my son and his cousin went to school as usual.  Thank God my son is fine.  As for my 14 year old nephew he passed in early April.  This will forever haunt us.
1317884617383383041 2020-10-19 01:45:52 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @ThereWiIlbBlood @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr When we were encouraged to go to China Town no one knew how deadly this disease was.  Well, there was one person and it was tRump.  Also, he only put restrictions on travel with China knowing all the while what the truth was.
1317883850559787008 2020-10-19 01:42:49 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @RyanPeter502 @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr When Nancy encouraged people to go to China Town it was to stimulate the small business owners.  Let's also be clear that when she did encourage people it was very early on and she like the rest of us did not know what tRump knew.  tRump likes blaming and China Town was hurting.
1317883286035857411 2020-10-19 01:40:35 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @BlindedByLyrics @adamhousley @DonaldJTrumpJr He never told us when he knew it was deadly and traveled through the air.  He could have saved tens of thousands of lives but he chose to lie.

He knew this virus was deadly and did not tell the American people.  He lost my vote.  So many deaths could have been prevented.  Unforgivable.

Although, from a personal stand point how tRump handled this virus has sickened me and there is not turning back.  Everyday I think about my 14 year old nephew and pray that his mom and dad can one day find some sort of peace.
1317656239170555904 2020-10-18 10:38:22 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Lol72064102 @TeamTrump @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump Again, I don't g by party but by person and character.  tRump and DeBlasio are vile in my eyes.  I would rather have the Tiger Kind (Joe Exotic) in office then those two jerks.
1317655516315848704 2020-10-18 10:35:30 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Lol72064102 @TeamTrump @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump See, we can agree to disagree or even agree.  I am mad at so many because this is a deadly disease and none of them should have been playing politics with our families lives.  DeBlasio should not even be handing out tokens at a country fair.
1317655121862549509 2020-10-18 10:33:56 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Lol72064102 @TeamTrump @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump It was March 12th  in NYC and a student fell violently ill due to covid and that one school closed down.  At that point all the schools should have been closed.  This virus doesn't care what party you are on.  DeBlasio needed to act sooner and so did rump.
1317654432822317062 2020-10-18 10:31:12 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Lol72064102 @TeamTrump @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump Rump only put restrictions n late Jan and finally put a ban on Europe on March 13th at 12am.  It was already too late by then.  As for the  NYC Mayor I am pissed at him as well.  Our schools should have been closed earlier.
1317653742439878656 2020-10-18 10:28:27 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Lol72064102 @TeamTrump @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump I am not disputing that China had a huge part in all of this but the fact is we were on rump's watch and he lied to us.  He knew how deadly this was and never told us to take precautions.  My 14 year old nephew was in school, got the virus and then passed late March.
1317652856753823745 2020-10-18 10:24:56 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Lol72064102 @TeamTrump @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump Did you happen to listen to the Woodward recordings????  Trump said he knew and that was in Jan., 2020 that the virus was deadly and traveled through the air and did not let us Americans know.  We all went about our business and people suffered and died.
1317652238756696066 2020-10-18 10:22:29 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @Lol72064102 @TeamTrump @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump We could agree to disagree but I will never change my mind.  My family saw the suffering first hand and we Americans needed to know facts from the start.

So, if Biden and Jesus Christ himself said something in the beginning I can not hold them accountable for it.  Trump lied.  Period!

1317650347033300992 2020-10-18 10:14:58 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @kylegriffin1 I can answer that in one word.  ASSHOLE

Now I see that even if Xi "played" him then he is incompetent at best.  He knew this virus was spread through the air and never told us to wear masks or to distance.  We lost two family members in early April because of his bullshit.
1317646831032172544 2020-10-18 10:00:59 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @KevinMKruse The Trump clan are full of spineless cowards.

Many of the covid deaths could have been prevented had asshole told us the truth from the start.  No excuse.  He is either unfit or just plain evil.

He did not address the issue of covid from the beginning and now so many souls have been lost.  He knew the disease was deadly and chose not to address the matter same as the bounties.  He is not fit for office.
1317636623325155336 2020-10-18 09:20:26 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @sharenell @DonaldJTrumpJr The big question is why did Donnie lie about this deadly disease.  He knew it was deadly and chose not to say anything to us Americans.  No other way to spin that one.

1317634978398744576 2020-10-18 09:13:53 +0800 <AlekaRichmond> @zanzotl @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Trump for prison.  Let's not forget about the bounties put on our military and asshole never addressed it.  He is Putin's puppy.
