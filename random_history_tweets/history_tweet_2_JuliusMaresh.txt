1344011755199078402 2020-12-30 04:05:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Some people just can’t get their priorities right or together.
1343957871885750274 2020-12-30 00:31:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> So very true!
1343948363931254784 2020-12-29 23:53:53 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Government isn’t about POWER OVER THE PEOPLE.  Government governs at the CONSENT of the people. DEMOCRATS/RINOS EXHIBIT THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THOSE TWO STATEMENTS. That is basically what is wrong with our government.
1343932934055723010 2020-12-29 22:52:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gailsline Thank you; someone better versed than I could amplify with the theme “On the Powers if Government.” God knows that far too many do not understand government’s role. They are too quick to look to government for assistance.
1343925151793086464 2020-12-29 22:21:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> And today’s Nazis are the social media companies plus MSM.
1343708056228651009 2020-12-29 07:59:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SarahLhl Thanks taking All those plus.....   I’m feeling much better already with just the vitamin/mineral supplements. Took acetaminophen for the fever and it’s only been 100.5. If I feel too tired I’ll lie down for an hour or so. Remember magnesium as well - important.
1343694992611618818 2020-12-29 07:07:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SarahLhl We need less government intrusion - not more.
1343694727955288070 2020-12-29 07:06:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SarahLhl Thank you; the only other kind thing government SHOULD get involved in is such things ensuring that businesses have a level playing field and that they do so in the LEAST intrusive manner. BTW wife &amp; I at home recuperating at from Covid.
1343692265345134600 2020-12-29 06:56:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Government’s primary or number one function is the defense of our nation. It is not to get involved in our everyday issues but to stay out of the way &amp; allow US to resolve those issues.
1343692264493735941 2020-12-29 06:56:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It is not about taxing working people and redistributing their earnings. It isn’t about an amoralistic society that defies God’s laws AND the basics of nature (biology). It is about loving your neighbor and individuals (not gov’t.) being charitable.
1343692262161715205 2020-12-29 06:56:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Reading the chain of comments following your tweet, it is obvious to me that far too many people in both parties don’t begin to understand true conservatism. It begins as follows:  1. GOD FIRST 2. Family second 3. Country third 4. Self last (very important)
1343566847485095937 2020-12-28 22:37:53 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @scotty_kiker Great illustration of China’s puppets. One has to ask - why is George Soros so bent on destroying our country?
1342966703983095809 2020-12-27 06:53:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The math simply doesn’t support Bidens numbers vs Obama’s.
1342862794753011712 2020-12-27 00:00:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> of the level of education or work each employee is doing? Would it be OK with you if you are a doctor but your pay was the same as the person sweeping the floors? Those are essentially what socialism amounts to. From those who have (earned) to those who have not (didn't earn).
1342862793779851265 2020-12-27 00:00:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Question to all those supporting the Socialist Democrat Agenda. Would think it's fair for a professor in college to give everyone the same grade regardless of what kind of work he did? Additionally, would you like your employer to give all employees the same salary regardless
1342281274464104448 2020-12-25 09:29:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @nwgoboating @JoyLinPark Sounds exactly like witness tampering and intimidation.
1342228137392934916 2020-12-25 05:58:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This is a treatment everyone should ask their doctor about if and as soon you test positive.   Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Authorizes Monoclonal Antibodies for Treatment of COVID-19  https://t.co/rtfYhpg7Mc
1342211485435572231 2020-12-25 04:52:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @scotty_kiker Beautiful!!!
1342114029775548423 2020-12-24 22:24:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @the_lorean @TheRightMelissa Oh yes like the price Marc Rich paid Clinton for his pardon.
1342113751831613446 2020-12-24 22:23:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @rbray61 @TheRightMelissa You are the epitome of a RACIST.
1342113569622601728 2020-12-24 22:23:04 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @rbray61 @TheRightMelissa That is the most despicable comment I’ve seen since I’ve been on twitter. Perhaps you are looking in a mirror and it applies to you. DISGUSTING!!!
1341936340716449792 2020-12-24 10:38:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @1776_son Congress just doesn’t understand setting priorities. Their bills show a marked lack of ability to focus. Perhaps they’re all suffering from ADD -attention deficit disorder.  We need to clean house and start from scratch. Throw the bums out - both parties.
1341930908123860993 2020-12-24 10:17:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KDuffySr @realDonaldTrump Go back and check the list of real criminals Bill Clinton pardoned. Those are the ones I remember most.
1341899472079622146 2020-12-24 08:12:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> By the way, I’ve been in close contact immediately prior to her positive test. Kept distance and wear mask when around her. Got my results today and I tested negative. God bless everyone.
1341899471190446080 2020-12-24 08:12:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Wife’s case is apparently mild and our doc got her immediately  scheduled for the infusion this morning. It takes 3 hr total time for Ck in, iv of med followed by saline and ck out. I waited in my vehicle. ASK YOUR DOCTOR TO DO THIS FOR YOU IF YOU TEST POSITIVE.
1341899469810520065 2020-12-24 08:12:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Methodist Hosp   Systems has set up Infusion centers in Sugar Land &amp; Katy, Tx. My wife tested + Sat. morn. &amp; yesterday our doc put in order; she rec’d it this morning. WHY AREN’T OTHERS??? Low Demand For Antibody Drugs Against COVID-19  https://t.co/94QT6hy2qN
1341893542311059456 2020-12-24 07:48:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @catholicthing @Stephen_P_White This was a great perspective on the innkeeper. I love the more positive perspective on him and his wife.
1341885957755334659 2020-12-24 07:18:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> IS THERE ANY REAL RESPONSIBILITY LEFT IN CONGRESS? Being responsible means making HARD TOUGH CHOICES and putting constituents ahead of ALL OTHERS. It’s all about setting PRIORITIES, something Congress seems incapable of. Foreign aid is way down that line of priorities.
1341884919157579777 2020-12-24 07:14:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JMcCollum06 @newsmax You can create a new life free of “arbitrary edicts” elsewhere. When you do leave, be SURE to leave any Democrat/leftist/progressive etc ideologies behind. Otherwise your move will be futile; you will just CONTAMINATE your new home with those destructive policies.
1341867972449738752 2020-12-24 06:07:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Congress calls the bill one thing which sounds appealing to constituents but THEN LOADS IT UP WITH SPECIAL INTEREST FUNDING. That is the ULTIMATE DECEIT!!! That’s why Trump should veto the bill or any other with garbage in it.
1341866955960184833 2020-12-24 06:03:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @tlw10500 @StappElizabeth @newsmax They just don’t learn!
1341866509061255168 2020-12-24 06:01:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That’s a great idea. Then we could screen anyone wanting to come here regarding their values/politics. After all, we were once an independent Republic before Voluntarily joining the USA.
1341804356451131395 2020-12-24 01:54:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> What an amazing change of attitude. They don’t care if it somehow benefits them.
1341764634295083015 2020-12-23 23:16:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Edit out the word eats in my reply. Twitter auto correct somehow added that. lol
1341762952496603139 2020-12-23 23:09:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Nancy doesn’t give a damn about her own constituents; much less about anyone’s else. Those who voted her in and keep doing so deserve what they got - she really has them bamboozled.
1341762392301121538 2020-12-23 23:07:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Who can blame them with IDIOTS like Cuomo and de Blasio running the state. Just leave those NY politics/policies behind.  Census: More People Left New York Than Any Other State  https://t.co/hrKOyJcuNR #Newsmax via @Newsmax
1341740549783564288 2020-12-23 21:40:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Have the guts to stand up for a legitimate STAND ALONE Covid relief bill. Let all those domestic interest eats and the foreign “aid” inclusions be voted on separately to see if they can stand in their own merits.
1341739776739856384 2020-12-23 21:37:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @RPDOTCOMPAGE @KDuffySr Very bad/poor legislation. You should all feel totally embarrassed. Compromise for the sake of compromise is always a disaster.
1341739082377015296 2020-12-23 21:35:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That bill is pathetic! It’s a complete embarrassment to anyone who voted for it.
1341734402557169666 2020-12-23 21:16:24 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I’d call it GRAND THEFT! I didn’t even like the way they were going to determine who would get the $600. It wasn’t need based but on $75,000 for individuals or $150,000 for couples. It should be based on whether you are employed or not similar to how unemployment benefits are.
1341733355629518854 2020-12-23 21:12:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I doubt any constituents - Democrat or Republican - would agree with what is in that bill.
1341712511868014593 2020-12-23 19:49:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 This is not about “playing ball” or compromising with Democrats; it is ALL about formulating logical, FOCUSED &amp; fair/reasonable legislation. Stick to common interests and that is Covid relief WITHOUT special interest inclusions. THAT’S BLACKMAILING our citizens.
1341567354048811008 2020-12-23 10:12:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 With all the pork that was in that bill, there must be a lot of dead pigs in DC. Guess you could say DJT roasted all that pork. It was a terrible bill.
1341548876415836166 2020-12-23 08:59:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Nope! Mutations occur randomly anywhere.
1341510070824296451 2020-12-23 06:24:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @TrumpJeBrigade Once again, politicians (especially Democrats) add unnecessary items to an important bill. We need to revise our system to have monk stand alone issue voting - NO PET PROJECT FUNDING.
1341509510230396934 2020-12-23 06:22:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I stand with you.
1341399648779558915 2020-12-22 23:06:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> And many who get the $600 don’t need it. It should have been structured to help those whose lost jobs or had to close their businesses. Why the hell are $$$$$ being included to go to foreign entities. It should be going to REAL victims.
1341382839535874049 2020-12-22 21:59:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MishaOBrien18 Thank you.
1341382681532231680 2020-12-22 21:58:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It appears they just may have done so.
1341382278920990721 2020-12-22 21:57:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Among many issues that defy all logic.
1341358001039552514 2020-12-22 20:20:43 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @marybeth05 @FortuneUSNews @eatshitcommies I would agree with you with an exception which I’ll put in the form of a question. Why do democrats in both houses walk in “lock-step” w/Pelosi (house) or Schumer (Senate). Also look at all the pork in this “so-called” aid bill. Including Pakistan &amp; Dali Lama???
1341208328517672960 2020-12-22 10:25:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MishaOBrien18 We were but my wife tested positive on Sat. morning so we had to go home. We always celebrate our sides family Christmas a week or so before Christmas. Fortunately she seems to have a light case.
1341188798726754304 2020-12-22 09:08:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Pelosi is clearly the worst speaker of the house in our history. Paul Ryan is a pretty close second for lack of support of President Trump.
1341188266494713857 2020-12-22 09:06:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Assistance should be based on who lost businesses or jobs and not on their income tax returns. If someone is gainfully employed and suffered no ill effects from this crisis, there is little or no reason to include them.
1341106328895406085 2020-12-22 03:40:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> What a beautiful picture (click on link) and accompanying words from Bishop Strickland.
1341104090475061251 2020-12-22 03:31:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Love that song by Simon &amp; Garfunkel. I also like “Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” They were always one of my favorites in my younger days.
1341101514656460800 2020-12-22 03:21:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That is pathetic. Democrats only see things thru their “special glasses.” They act like a prism changing the truth.
1341093672646012930 2020-12-22 02:50:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> How could he possible gotten elected. 133,000,000 registered voters; 74,000,000voted Trump. That only leaves 54,000,000 but “they” say Biden got 81,000,000. Where did the other 27,000,000 come from? That’s FUZZY MATH!!! Cheating???
1340874280461086720 2020-12-21 12:18:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @jamiecstanfield @bologzown You have our deepest sympathy. May God be with him and at your side.
1340871450060877824 2020-12-21 12:07:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @BLUEBOYGEO Right on!!! You got it; why can't California understand?
1340826207286341632 2020-12-21 09:07:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @loroli951402 @gailsline @DGPurser @catholicthing I can remember before Nixon (yes, a Republican) created the EPA. It was well structured and served its intended purpose in cleaning up our environment. It created a level playing field for ALL manufacturing including mining, refining etc. then Dems got involved &amp; “overzealous.”
1340794430928932864 2020-12-21 07:01:17 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Those numbers; registered voters versus total votes cast are verifiable. It's a point well made!!!
1340793970570498053 2020-12-21 06:59:27 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That's what analysis is all about - pointing out these "anomalies" and not just brushing them off. Nothing about this election passes the smell test. It's completely illogical.
1340786467283628033 2020-12-21 06:29:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @loroli951402 @gailsline @DGPurser @catholicthing You might want to look into.   https://t.co/CPECW7yqqt  - this org is putting out a movie called Climate Hustle 2 which gives a more realistic view/side of the issues.
1340785600706842624 2020-12-21 06:26:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @loroli951402 @gailsline @DGPurser @catholicthing That 5% is very likely correct. Too much “relating” to science in all its spheres has been POLLUTED by being politicized. Government grants were given to those “scientists” who were willing to push the environmental (CC) narrative. Sadly they’ve sold their souls to SATAN.
1340310810657234944 2020-12-19 22:59:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Nor is the government our “Mommy.”
1340310304832544770 2020-12-19 22:57:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I agree completely. We are adults and only need real facts so that we can make our own decisions. We don’t need government making those decisions for us.
1340309203156668417 2020-12-19 22:53:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That’s the kind of thinking that makes people believe there is medical rationing. My wife &amp; I will not take the vaccine due to the use of fetal tissue in its development.
1340306194024558592 2020-12-19 22:41:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @CaringAngel_1 Hard to imagine that those few counties could determine the president of the US.
1339746343628234752 2020-12-18 09:36:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Mor about those “infamous Paris Accords” that placed undue burdens on the USA while giving China free rein.   China's big fat climate lie:  https://t.co/nlhBvZRJ3i
1339561902993788929 2020-12-17 21:23:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Check out full story on:  https://t.co/FDHlYVvO4I
1339560624095965187 2020-12-17 21:18:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Joe Biden gave zero to cancer charity while spending $$$ on admin salaries and travel.
1339553855844052994 2020-12-17 20:51:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gailsline @catholicthing Check out the Milankovitch Cycles. Just copy and paste into Google or safari &amp; you can see what it is. It’s true science by a geophysicist &amp; astronomer.
1339552116453609473 2020-12-17 20:44:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I am constantly amazed by those stating “ follow the science” who don’t actually do so. TRUE SCIENCE evaluates all aspects regarding a hypothesis. Neither the “doctors” about Covid nor the “greenies” on Climate Change want to evaluate ALL THE FACTS. Both are highly politicized!
1339549861998419972 2020-12-17 20:35:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I left out the part that Milutin Milankovitch was also an astronomer. Anyone truly interested in climate change facts can easily look up “Milankovitch Cycles” on the internet. Also volcanic activity &amp; solar flare activity impact climate periodically. Together it can be drastic.
1339548396126932992 2020-12-17 20:29:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @loroli951402 @gailsline @DGPurser @catholicthing Great reply to my original comment. I elaborated a little on your reply. People are making comments w/o ever looking into facts. You did and I compliment you.
1339547995994529795 2020-12-17 20:28:24 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The Milankovitch Cycle named after a Serbian geophysicist describes this process in detail. It involves not only changes in the ovality of earth’s orbit around the sun but variations in its tilt on its axis - about 7.5 degrees.
1339545474555109377 2020-12-17 20:18:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> AND that is just one of many climate change FEAR MONGERS’ predictions that never came to fruition. UNBELIEVABLE AGENDA!!!
1339386504150470657 2020-12-17 09:46:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KDuffySr @realDonaldTrump Fauci s anti family unity.
1339386144874766337 2020-12-17 09:45:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gailsline @realMikeLindell Shapiro is sick!!! His illness is a warped mind.
1339385674064138242 2020-12-17 09:43:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> So very true.
1339377413961248770 2020-12-17 09:10:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gailsline @catholicthing In addition, that same "scientific" community and their fellow politicians try to ostracize or even condemn anyone who may disagree with their premise on CC. Man being the primary cause of CC is not even close to a proven fact. Climate fluctuates over time.
1339374903838031879 2020-12-17 09:00:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gailsline @catholicthing Great commentary!
1339374820425920512 2020-12-17 09:00:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gailsline @catholicthing Exactly what the Catholic Thing article was pointing out.
1339345484318732288 2020-12-17 07:03:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Oh my gosh! I really butchered my 1st sentence. It should have read: “You are in the company of a large group of people.” Anyway you got the gist of it.
1339241087223861249 2020-12-17 00:08:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Same here. We need a  new party - The Patriots Party.
1339186440006209538 2020-12-16 20:31:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It was all an ANTI-TRUMP action.
1339182672514519046 2020-12-16 20:16:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> THOUGHTS ABOUT RIGHTS &amp; VALUES. GREAT READ  Rights Talk vs. Dialogue  https://t.co/7Ml4v84dUk via @CatholicThing

1339019388155006976 2020-12-16 09:27:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The MSM and social media - Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and Google are all guilty of VOTER SUPPRESSION by virtue of not covering the negative stories about Joe Biden and his son Hunter &amp; the Hunter Biden laptop. In fact they made misleading comments.
1339011703590313984 2020-12-16 08:57:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Everyone should read “Confessions of St. Augustine.”  It really is insightful but a heavy read.
1339011098687778816 2020-12-16 08:54:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Beautiful prayer.
1339010447102660608 2020-12-16 08:52:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I just read Bishop Strickland’s book “Light and Leaven” and recommend it to all. I interrupted my reading of “Churchill -Walking with Destiny” when the book arrived. It is highly instructive and an easy read. Conversational style. +++
1338981840368115714 2020-12-16 06:58:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Climate Changers push their narrative as though it was unanimously agreed upon by the scientific community when in fact there is much dissension amongst some of the top scientists in the world. CO2 is something that plant life thrives on absorbing CO2 &amp; producING O2 (oxygen).
1338978875058102277 2020-12-16 06:46:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> They did this garbage for 4 years and Biden has the AUDACITY to say "we need to come together." What goes around, comes around; he can expect opposition at every turn other than when a bill is STAND ALONE (no fluff) and clearly in the interests of the people.
1338978142606815244 2020-12-16 06:44:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Biden doesn't want to know the true will of the people. If he was honest, he would have supported an in depth audit of all the votes given the lack of confidence in the Dominion voting systems.
1338977428446851077 2020-12-16 06:41:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Democrats always take care of those who can line their pockets first and then if there are tidbits left, the pass it on to the masses. That's the Democrat way.
1338977007955218432 2020-12-16 06:39:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @amyklobuchar I think a better fit is cheated his way to victory. Does anyone believe old Joe got 15,000,000 more votes than either Obama or Hillary Clinton? That really takes a stretch. I'll hand one thing to them; they did a hell of a job with how they perpetrated the fraud.
1338976435671887876 2020-12-16 06:37:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The way they got around showing old Joe receiving any monies was to pass the bills to Hunter and he paid them. That way the only money passing was shown as going to him and no ties to Joe. Then they both lie about knowledge of what was going on. Plausible TRUTH!!!Not Denial!!!

1338929964062814210 2020-12-16 03:32:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Oh yes, I haven't seen one in many years who even had a smattering of either.
1338927914205786112 2020-12-16 03:24:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Very RATIONAL  article on CC The Magical World of “Climate Change”  https://t.co/8bMIn0Gskq via @CatholicThing
1338925339179954178 2020-12-16 03:14:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> There is not a better example to follow in the footsteps of -  The Footsteps of Jesus.
1338837492611551234 2020-12-15 21:25:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The fraud was very sinister; it didn’t affect down ballot races but targeted the vote for president.
1338826701082652672 2020-12-15 20:42:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We must re-establish trust in our election system.
1338826350770212864 2020-12-15 20:40:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> God be with AG Barr. He has left Durham to continue investigating by naming him a special prosecutor. Let’s not sell Barr short so quickly.
1338825797541507083 2020-12-15 20:38:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This will be hard for Biden and his MAFIA to stop.
1338825548764766208 2020-12-15 20:37:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Yes, and he will probably just get a slap on the wrist as he is a DEMOCRAT.
1338825224872202243 2020-12-15 20:36:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Spread this far and wide. Soros’ tentacles are just too much into virtually every issue.
1338824345997758465 2020-12-15 20:32:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Gov. Cuomo is clearly the playground bully. I’m all for waiting for ALL the facts but his general GESTAPO TACTIC behavior observed publicly gives support that he would be abusive privately. What we see suggests a domineering nature not even aware of his own actions.
1338635391214219264 2020-12-15 08:02:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> You tell’em Lauren!  I suppose there is no evidence if you refuse to allow any to be presented.
1338590658861412352 2020-12-15 05:04:17 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Biden doesn't remember what he says from one day to the next. It's either senility or onset of Alzheimer's. It could also be simply dementia.
1338583923442544641 2020-12-15 04:37:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> When you look at the tabulations in Table 3, the very first line lists Flu. So if someone got very sick from Flu they likely contracted Covid as well and died. But what really CAUSED the death.
1338583922553262083 2020-12-15 04:37:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Table 3 comment copied directly from the CDC report: "Table 3 shows the types of health conditions and contributing causes mentioned in conjunction with deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). For 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned."
1338580282883137541 2020-12-15 04:23:03 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Let us keep up our HOPE!
1338574942305185794 2020-12-15 04:01:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Why is it that we are not seeing any reports of Flu deaths? Perhaps that's because virtually every death report is being linked to Covid. There is a 99.8% overall recovery rate. They report everything as Covid deaths to scare the populace. I hear of more recoveries than deaths.
1338574004144234496 2020-12-15 03:58:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This is misleading information as the CDC reports themselves lists these deaths as "Covid involved deaths" as opposed to Covid caused deaths which they claim are 6% of the 300,000.  U.S. crosses 300,000 COVID-19 deaths as vaccine rollout begins  https://t.co/drogWMUHWU

1338304678954754049 2020-12-14 10:07:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Takes courage to come forward.
1338304208005713920 2020-12-14 10:06:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JamieSemprucci Should be spontaneous all over the country. Multiple demonstrations.
1338303884234813441 2020-12-14 10:04:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @LoveHerMo @JulieReichwein1 We need hard evidence.
1338286856585228288 2020-12-14 08:57:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Is it time to hold a mass mask burning demonstration?  More land more information coming out contraindicating effectiveness of masks. Some note that masks actually cause infection in many. It even bothers peoples eyes where the mask touched the edges of the eye.
1338286001400197120 2020-12-14 08:53:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Perfect way to address tyranny.
1338250508147052547 2020-12-14 06:32:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @nypost and I forgot, DISGUSTING!
1338250380375887874 2020-12-14 06:32:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Someone has to stand in the gap.
1338240522973016069 2020-12-14 05:52:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @nypost HORRIBLE AND UTTERLY TASTELESS!
1338201696665817103 2020-12-14 03:18:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We have an obligation to educate those around us and especially our offspring because they are being indoctrinated subtly via our education system.
1338177255621746691 2020-12-14 01:41:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> True but many of us refuse to take the vaccine for a variety of reasons. Primarily is the fact that most were developed using aborted fetal tissue at some point in development/testing. Also why vaccinate for a virus that has a 99.8% recovery rate?
1338173600306749443 2020-12-14 01:27:03 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> They have already laundered the money to cover the money trail. Does anyone actually trust the BIDENS?
1338173020691640325 2020-12-14 01:24:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> They cannot be allowed to get away Scott free. MSM &amp; social media should not be able to shape the minds of the electorate by withholding pertinent information. It’s up to the reader/listener to make up his mind regarding facts presented.
1338172031108517888 2020-12-14 01:20:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I understand why Barr withheld information but don’t agree with that philosophy. It may well have led to a criminal being elected.
1338171457139073024 2020-12-14 01:18:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> No doubt about it. There should be some way to charge MSM &amp; social media with withholding very important material information that resulted in at the least swaying votes to Biden. It likely changed the result and was obviously intentional.
1338164319930953729 2020-12-14 00:50:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Quite a demo on a cello! Carol of the Bells (for 12 cellos) - The Piano Guys  https://t.co/6TaJnzygLg via @YouTube
1338149772084064258 2020-12-13 23:52:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Pure fabricator of facts.
1338146904077549569 2020-12-13 23:40:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It’s just like how the MSM wouldn’t dig into the “allegations” regarding the Hunter Biden laptop mess but instead TRIED TO NEGATE IT ALL. Now that Hunter admitted he’s being investigated &amp; election is past they can’t escape the TRUTH. Selective news coverage!!! BIASED!!!
1338145893036470272 2020-12-13 23:36:57 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @TheTrumpParty @CurtisHebert @TheHayride I also do not agree w/turning our flag upside down tho I did agree w/message.
1338141173903405059 2020-12-13 23:18:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Is this the Quantum Voting System?  https://t.co/XxAIUEVYGu
1338140293959397377 2020-12-13 23:14:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> And consider that Trump got more votes than any previous sitting president.
1338139376342196225 2020-12-13 23:11:03 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> They love the President.
1338096784523096064 2020-12-13 20:21:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> When virtually all deaths today are labeled as Covid deaths, it’s no wonder the numbers keep going up. Charlie Pride just died at 86 &amp; his death was listed as from complications with Covid. He could have just as easily dies from flu complications at age 86. Not heartless -factual
1338094669482369026 2020-12-13 20:13:24 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I think given the info that has been released, it’s time for Barr to appoint a special prosector to investigate Jo Biden AND his crime family.
1338094104954146818 2020-12-13 20:11:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump But now all are jumping on the story as Hunter admitted he is being investigated.
1338093767753134080 2020-12-13 20:09:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @TimRunsHisMouth Apparently we/they have become too much a nation of SHEEP. They have already bought in to the virus that has a 99.8% survival rate.
1337873072402132992 2020-12-13 05:32:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This is part 2 of the video.

1337791561405493253 2020-12-13 00:08:57 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @DonaIdQTrump Perhaps we shouldn’t be spreading this as spreading it could be detrimental. As one who server in the U. S. Army, we don’t need to give our enemies any information. That is not good military strategy.

1337432302884958208 2020-12-12 00:21:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ItIsWhatItIsGuy @elonmusk @SenTedCruz What you really mean is the green revolution myth. It amazes me at how little the greenies understand about the environmental destruction done to perpetuate their myths.
1337431379483762693 2020-12-12 00:17:43 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ZheeZhee916 @elonmusk I would surmise that is because your “assumptions” are purely a matter of opinion. Twenty % of the people of this country pay 80% of the taxes. Overtaxation is a disincentive to business investment. Poor people don’t create jobs. FACTS MATTER.
1337430452483874820 2020-12-12 00:14:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Texas is pro business; help us keep it that way. Say no to liberal -left wing politics.
1337430148421914625 2020-12-12 00:12:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Beautiful sight.
1337429949653913601 2020-12-12 00:12:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @elonmusk Now that you’ve said you have moved to Texas, remember those radical ideologies that created the problems facing Calif. and don’t bring those liberal politics with you. We must keep Texas red or you’ll be wanting to move again.
1337424749161549829 2020-12-11 23:51:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> To Republican citizens of Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Do not allow your Democrat bureaucrats to steal your votes. Force them to follow the US constitution and have your legislature take back their legitimate power.
1337423588496969730 2020-12-11 23:46:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I’m with you David. I only wear one when/where I have to to enter.

1337190375744737281 2020-12-11 08:20:04 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ConspiracyGran Everyone needs to realize that computers which are used for tabulating (counting/summarizing) our votes can be programed to give the desired results.  You enter the exact same number of votes for each candidate but somehow one comes up with more votes - that's programed in.
1337181265280327680 2020-12-11 07:43:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> No one will ever see fraud if they close their eyes to it.
1337125613505753089 2020-12-11 04:02:43 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @thetoyman1 Really? Isn’t it a cabinet level position?

1337021584209539076 2020-12-10 21:09:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Now up to 18 states. Once they read the filing, several states’ AGs joined the lawsuit as they recognized the actions of the “4” states sued also affected their residents. Voters were disenfranchised by virtue of those actions.
1337019818516635651 2020-12-10 21:02:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> People better open their eyes.
1337019258006548480 2020-12-10 21:00:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Rparkerscience @gatewaypundit Everyone should take the time to read this. Why isn’t this front page news?

1336838938783342594 2020-12-10 09:03:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @whobedannyd @FoxNews Watching Newsmax now.
1336827366509834244 2020-12-10 08:17:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @whobedannyd Fantastic! Thanks Danny. I’m flipping between OANN, NEWSMAX and Fox. Yes certain ones on Fox are reasonable. It depends on when you watch Fox.
1336826632091426821 2020-12-10 08:14:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Latest news from OANN: 17 states now have joined Texas in the lawsuit against Those 4 states.
1336764197103865861 2020-12-10 04:06:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Now the "hate tweets" start coming out from those who know they cheated in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin &amp; Georgia. The case is 170 pages well documented so b4 anyone start throwing darts at the suit, consider that the SCOTUS has already ordered those states to respond to it.
1336760546742374407 2020-12-10 03:52:04 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Agree
1336712137008422913 2020-12-10 00:39:43 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 The problem as 1 of your other responders noted is getting together enough monetary backing. Ross Perot tried that (as an independent) and cost George H. W. Bush the whitehouse. That’s what gave Bill Clinton the presidency. Unfortunately libs cont. following like sheep.
1336661923673350147 2020-12-09 21:20:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @steve_vladeck Your prejudices are reflected in your “legal opinion”. Even as a layman, who has server on many juries, I see holes in your reasoning in particular that you missed the essence of this Texas lawsuit. That is the disenfranchisement of voters in states other than those 4.
1336660786287087621 2020-12-09 21:15:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @steve_vladeck I find your commentary ridiculous. Your comparison of a constitutional voting issue in the 4 states to Vermont suing Texas over oil drilling is illogical. There is nothing in the constitution regulation the oil industry; there is however about voting.
1336659553954521088 2020-12-09 21:10:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> You will find extensive prejudice against anything favorable to President Trump in the MSM. If they even cover it, they put a negative twist into the report.

1336642886272737284 2020-12-09 20:04:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Omer_Causey Same here but only saw reports on Fox &amp; also on OANN. Paxton discussed the case again briefly on Fox &amp; Friends this morning. Interesting case.

1336642054609395712 2020-12-09 20:01:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Omer_Causey @RAHarrisonPA @ProfMJCleveland @Isabellex333 @NoChromeHD That was all discussed by Jordan Sekulow on Newsmax along with the fact that the lawsuit had solid basis/standing. In any event, this is a very important case.
1336641143333908486 2020-12-09 19:57:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Dutchman1450 @Scotus Let’s hope their FINAL rulings are favorable to our cause.
1336529036261150723 2020-12-09 12:32:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Omer_Causey Fox &amp; Newsmax
1336528909450571777 2020-12-09 12:31:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Omer_Causey I watched the interviews of AG Paxton on Hannity (Fox) and Jordan Sekulow on Newsmax commenting on the status. I’ll take their word over yours.
1336527835972980737 2020-12-09 12:27:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Omer_Causey Don’t have access to it but it’s been all over the news about SCOTUS ordering the 4 states to respond. I’ll wait &amp; see what happens next as they were given until 3 PM Thursday to file their responses.
1336515769287512066 2020-12-09 11:39:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Update: hearing 10 more states joining Texas lawsuit along with Louisiana.
1336511339288793091 2020-12-09 11:21:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @RetOfTheMack619 @disclosetv You are obviously no lawyer or a very poor one. The way the lawsuit was structured, it was allowed to go directly to the SCOTUS.
1336510599853969410 2020-12-09 11:18:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Allen West: Seven States Will Join Texas in SCOTUS Lawsuit Against Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania  https://t.co/fHjW88MtMv
1336508497505169408 2020-12-09 11:10:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @kevinwhyte87 @disclosetv They already ordered responses from the respondent states.
1336508208731615233 2020-12-09 11:09:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @RetOfTheMack619 @disclosetv They’ve already accepted it by ordering those 4 other states to respond.
1336507747655933952 2020-12-09 11:07:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @sickendun2death @alanbdavis10 @disclosetv You apparently miss the point. Texas and/or any other state does have the right to ensure that another state is in COMPLIANCE with the US constitution. It isn’t about one state telling another how to run its election but that it must follow the constitution.
1336506181993586688 2020-12-09 11:01:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Lauraslifeonink @disclosetv If he truly didn’t cheat, so be it. However there has been too much evidence that has been ignored without fully hearing the evidence.
1336504707116900352 2020-12-09 10:55:27 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @TheRISEofROD I just heard it in Hannity and he had AG Paxton on his show.
1336501597489213440 2020-12-09 10:43:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Supreme Court orders Georgia,  Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to respond to Texas lawsuit over 2020 election irregularities. Essentially lawsuit claims Texas voters disenfranchised by specific actions by those states officials re US constitution.
1336490204585218049 2020-12-09 09:57:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Merry Christmas Justin.
1336489844520980481 2020-12-09 09:56:24 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It is time to start looking at the 2022 mid-term elections to take control of both houses of Congress. This has to be our contingency plan in light of what we se happening.
1336489842469908480 2020-12-09 09:56:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It seems that FRW ARE INTERESTED IN TRUTH.   “They” are only interested in maintaining the status quo. When the masses finally wake up and see what voted in, it will be too late. We can only try to stop them in the Senate for now.
1336472904729579521 2020-12-09 08:49:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Jennyjen010 It's only controversial to twitter @jack.
1336362355442257927 2020-12-09 01:29:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Rayesunraye One more thing, Mothers have to ALLOW our young men to BE men and not keep trying to feminize them.
1336362150185603076 2020-12-09 01:28:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Rayesunraye Agree fully!
1336354906257678342 2020-12-09 01:00:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Population control, environmental control, gun control - all  have one thing in common; it's all about CONTROL OF US!!! It isn't about making this country a better place to live; it is all about control of the masses by a few elitists. Control is the signature of communism.
1336348645252325377 2020-12-09 00:35:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It's all leftwing rhetoric. Unification requires that the left give up on their outlandish policy aims like gun control &amp; the green new deal. For anyone with half a brain, they would look at the facts/science &amp; recognize that guns are not the problem &amp; CC is not a one sided issue
1336300269718691841 2020-12-08 21:23:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> And we lose another of our great men. Sadly though, we are here for only a few short years; let us all take this moment to remember to make the most of our lives AND that LIFE IS NOT WITHOUT RISKS. Yeager took those risks in stride as we all should.
1336101109652480005 2020-12-08 08:11:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> All of the items.
1336089423960748032 2020-12-08 07:25:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @DrEstella @realDonaldTrump I do not hate as they did as hate tends to destroy even the hater. I do understand your sentiment though. We must be above hatred. That doesn’t mean we cooperate with anything they propose.
1336084029024694272 2020-12-08 07:03:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Any privilege that came to us was EARNED by us and Not BESTOWED on UN by any other person or our government. All we ever asked was for our governments to stay the hell out of the way. AND don’t tax us into poverty.
1336032387566882820 2020-12-08 03:38:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Very much so.
1336009844894150658 2020-12-08 02:09:03 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Be there! If you can.
1336004425001930753 2020-12-08 01:47:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 @YouWantedABeast 😌It's useful for certain concoctions.
1336002467868381184 2020-12-08 01:39:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We need this out ASAP.
1335999194226683905 2020-12-08 01:26:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This purchase should not have been allowed under National security concerns.
1335998294473011208 2020-12-08 01:23:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We will not be controlled!
1335992779126808579 2020-12-08 01:01:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> WE SHALL NOT BE SHEEP!
1335987083727482882 2020-12-08 00:38:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @catholicthing @ABradfordMiner Hey Brad, the article failed to post. Was that intended? I retweeted it and then sent it to someone via a dm so that's how I noticed. I had read it in my email.
1335986734589501443 2020-12-08 00:37:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Nice expression; I think we are all a bit weary at this point. And though we may be weary, We are not beaten!
1335985930650480644 2020-12-08 00:34:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 @YouWantedABeast How about a touch of Kahlua in that hot cocoa? It adds a nice touch.
1335935928485941250 2020-12-07 21:15:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> A very touching story.
1335771132360847362 2020-12-07 10:20:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> God be with you, Ray.
1335746788289077256 2020-12-07 08:43:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The PUPPET in action.
1335746463591231488 2020-12-07 08:42:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The time to take to the forests and streets of America is upon us to stop the menace trying to destroy American Ideals and Greatness. We cannot allow it to persist - it is a CANCER growing in our nation.
1335743366571716610 2020-12-07 08:30:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JBAmericanPNW @Rob_Noorollah Unfortunately too many have been “feminized” by their radical feminist mothers.
1335735679297400832 2020-12-07 07:59:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> No matter who is president we must ALL ALWAYS work to KAG - Keep America Great! Whatever it takes, we must be willing to make that sacrifice for our country. That is how we won our freedoms  in the first place.
1335734169503223808 2020-12-07 07:53:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @AllisonJennin17 Same with the Pope regarding Cardinal Zen and Chinese Catholics. We’ve been guilty of placating in the interest of “getting along” to avoid persecution. No more!!!
1335671213960597504 2020-12-07 03:43:27 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Another astute Dodie tweet. Too bad Democrats can’t seem to understand that.
1335632722316976129 2020-12-07 01:10:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> John 6 is my favorite and within that chapter, “The Bread of Life Discourse.” Straightforward and reiterated - not to be “ interpreted” as some do adding the word symbol.
1335631694758617091 2020-12-07 01:06:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We need more Bishops like you and Archbishop Chaput to speak out boldly as he has done. TOO MANY OF OUR BISHOPS HAVE BEEN MISLEADING OUR FLOCK WITH DUPLICITOUS TEACHING/COMMENTARY. The Church needs FIRM AND UNAMBIGUOUS LEADERSHIP. We don’t have that consistency today. Pax Christi
1335552333263085568 2020-12-06 19:51:04 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @LauraWesterberg Woman??? I’m a man; wife is a woman. Had to clarify that given today’s society. 😀
1335400547457839104 2020-12-06 09:47:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It certainly doesn’t add up. Total statistical anomaly!
1335267809794908162 2020-12-06 01:00:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> When you really read through the CDC statistical data and get down to table 3, there is an introductory notation STATING THAT DEATHS CAUSED BY COVID ARE ONLY 6% of the total cases you keep seeing in the MSM. Total cases are those where Covid is/may have been involved.
1335266710404952064 2020-12-06 00:56:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Apparently @RENEEWEATHERS2 was there and administered a breathalyzer test to the witness. Otherwise her contention is total BS!
1335265957263052800 2020-12-06 00:53:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Time to start a new party which will draw HONEST PEOPLE from both Republican and Democrat Parties.  We can name our new party THE PATRIOTS PARTY. It seems that both of our current parties are more interested in placating our enemies than standing up to the. MAGA - AMERICA FIRST!
1335264981600727041 2020-12-06 00:49:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The seasonal flu is BURRIED in and obscured by calling everything Covid-19. You  know that disease with a 99.8% overall recovery rate.
1335239391678238721 2020-12-05 23:07:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump @EricTrump Unfortunately, it's not easy to find past tweets on twitter.
1335239019857326083 2020-12-05 23:06:04 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SirDave01 That's a very good question. I did hear about the priest who died after getting the vaccine.
1335238233068875778 2020-12-05 23:02:56 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump @EricTrump There is also the story of the person (woman) who was about to lose her home and property and he paid it off for her to avoid her losing it. Can't find the details or link on that anymore though.
1335199836174479360 2020-12-05 20:30:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Twitter “disputes” ANYTHING that is/might be favorable to Trump. Take it w/a grain of salt.
1335196234408226819 2020-12-05 20:16:03 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That number is probably closer to 75 million. Many of the others simply have on blinders like a plow mule. For those too young to know what those are, they kept the mules focused straight ahead. Don’t allow facts to distract - stay narrow minded.
1335194788107313154 2020-12-05 20:10:18 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> FBI is corrupt! Even Barr has difficulty knowing who to trust in FBI AND CIA.
1335190926478684160 2020-12-05 19:54:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Good questions.
1335190686812020736 2020-12-05 19:54:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @scotty_kiker @Perduesenate @sendavidperdue We have to be rational and not merely reactive. Working with Democrats on issues we MAY agree with isn’t a bad thing. We meet to pick our battles
1335053550469124096 2020-12-05 10:49:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Nancy flip flops more than a fish out of water.
1335052816432435200 2020-12-05 10:46:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Burgess I picked cotton alongside my black brothers and Mexicans in the early 1950’s. Finally got a degree in 1988 while raising 6 children. Al of them now have college degrees the easy way. We made it possible for them but they earned them.
1335052095964246016 2020-12-05 10:43:18 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @AOC Poor baby; you don’t have the slightest idea of what many if not most of us had to go through to attain a measure of success. Learn something from your elders and others who have gone before you. STOP WHINING!!!
1335051306080346117 2020-12-05 10:40:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MattWalshBlog @AOC LOL
1335041456529137667 2020-12-05 10:01:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Spread the word. If this item is real, why isn’t in Sidney Powell’s bag of evidence? They could call this woman and her “baby” and confront them making them testify under oath. Otherwise, anyone could have fabricated this.
1334911419884720131 2020-12-05 01:24:18 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We stand with President Trump!
1334876930357727232 2020-12-04 23:07:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @annettets1 @UlsterFryNI @BorisJohnson @MattHancock Very nice!
1334849749560782852 2020-12-04 21:19:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We don’t need to be bringing in outside workers who will work for lower wages while we have so many still not working. @SenMikeLee  haven’t you ever heard of govt sponsored training programs thru tax benefits? Even JFK did that &amp; it works.
1334842602080890881 2020-12-04 20:50:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It won’t change anything.
1334655386746572808 2020-12-04 08:26:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @FordhamLawTX @HiltonHouston @HoustonFirst @nonsequiteuse @indivisibleHOU @unitehere You’re sick, vulgar and have no idea what you’re talking about. You are being reported and blocked.
1334654055113744384 2020-12-04 08:21:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Withalacoochi Good question; she certainly isn’t a typical Democrat. She isn’t just another sheep; she thinks for herself.
1334653068328177666 2020-12-04 08:17:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @FordhamLawTX @HiltonHouston @HoustonFirst @nonsequiteuse @indivisibleHOU @unitehere Zero and FYI, Covid-19 has an overall recovery rate of 98.8%. And that number includes all the deaths caused by Democrat governors sending infected elderly w/co-morbidities BACK TO NURSING HOMES in at least 4 states. Those have highest death count. Facts count!!!
1334590227013398539 2020-12-04 04:08:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @CoachLouHoltz88 I add my congrats to Lou Holtz. Thank you Lou for your great coaching and service to our nation.
1334534512395636736 2020-12-04 00:26:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ScottAPatient @TulsiGabbard @realDonaldTrump If those 7 million votes were honestly cast, no one would be challenging. Apparently you haven't watched/listened to sworn testimony (under oath w/penalties for perjury) of vote counting issues in several major cities. I suppose some of you have no interest in knowing the truth.
1334534022098276352 2020-12-04 00:24:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MRains @TulsiGabbard @realDonaldTrump Apparently your ideas of "freedom" is the freedom to manipulate elections to determine the winner. If that is allowed regardless of which party benefits, our nation loses.
1334533632229306375 2020-12-04 00:23:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @mdnaidu @TulsiGabbard @realDonaldTrump Trump is one of the few who truly do have an interest in our country. Not only did he give his presidential salary to charities, but he has not enriched himself at the expense of taxpayers as Biden, Pelosi, Waters, Feinstein, Schumer and many other career Democrats have done.
1334533153499865088 2020-12-04 00:21:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Though I may not agree with many of your political views I can see that  you are an honorable woman. These "investigations" into the election "anomalies" should be a bi-partisan action. WHY WOULD ANYONE NOT WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? Clearly there are ISSUES WITH IT.
1334529360305541120 2020-12-04 00:06:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Barr's special counsel move could tie up his successor  https://t.co/whiroOmCeq
1334487644210933760 2020-12-03 21:20:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @VeronicaTalbot9 @flyftrs102 @yojudenz Would be nice to know but I don’t need to know the author to appreciate the message.
1334479588198649857 2020-12-03 20:48:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I totally disagree with Lindsey Graham and Obama regarding AOC. THERE IS NO PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR SOCIALISM. Too many of our forefathers and many of us fought to keep our country free. SAY NO TO SOCIALISM!!!
1334313631316586496 2020-12-03 09:48:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Most definitely; Obama could not hold a candle to Walter Williams. He was an honorable and wise man.
1334313178767962122 2020-12-03 09:47:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @TheRealWNK @michaeljohns @gbroh10 Amen to that. He had such great insight and understanding of the facts.
1334312939608797185 2020-12-03 09:46:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I can only echo the words of Michael Johns; Walter Williams was a wise and highly rational economist and MAN.
1334312397864120323 2020-12-03 09:44:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> My condolences to the Williams family. For several years I would not only read but save his articles. I hold Walter E. Williams in the highest esteem. Tremendous wisdom.
1334261794458755077 2020-12-03 06:22:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 I'll be on the lookout.
1334259065342619649 2020-12-03 06:12:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Hope you have a great show tonight. I'm sure you will; you never do anything halfway.
1334254918077657089 2020-12-03 05:55:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JennieKoo @GOP Amen to that.
1334225303976243203 2020-12-03 03:57:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> In any case it is a big concern. I think that everyone involved in/with the Mueller “investigation” needs to be charged and put on trial.
1334224732523274241 2020-12-03 03:55:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The reports about Barr was from AP (all propaganda). Did anyone see him actually make that statement.
1333806634058002432 2020-12-02 00:14:17 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Hang tough Matt!
1333751897132576776 2020-12-01 20:36:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> First freeze of the season and coldest temps since last February for Houston area. Temps flirting w/freezing at my home where present temp is 34 degrees. Freeze warnings for entire Houston area.
1333595078166777857 2020-12-01 10:13:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Take up the chant!
1333562483290861568 2020-12-01 08:04:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Very likely what happened.
1333500457440972801 2020-12-01 03:57:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Not only our POTUS but his followers as well with derogatory comments. i.e. “If you have to think about who to vote for, you ain’t black.” Democrats want it both ways but it doesn’t work like that.
1333499718199107586 2020-12-01 03:54:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JoeBiden Are you suffering so badly from dementia that you have forgotten all the hatred and disrespect both you &amp; Democrats in general directed toward President Trump and anyone following him? NO WAY JOSE!!! No bipartisanship in the offering.
1333498771678896129 2020-12-01 03:50:57 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Your funds may not be safe in a Biden-Harris administration.
1333210473861439488 2020-11-30 08:45:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> COMMUNIST NEWS NETWORK. Propaganda machine!  https://t.co/HxD6M0BSMX
1333210025427406848 2020-11-30 08:43:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Gone the way of Covid.  https://t.co/6UC0JAq6hI
1333172069606055943 2020-11-30 06:12:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> If you haven’t listened to this, you’re missing out. Fr. Pavone DISSECTS the election and makes the case for Trump.
1333085270510538752 2020-11-30 00:27:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Democrats want to take away our guns so that they and all their criminal elements will be the only ones with them. That will then allow them to run roughshod over law abiding citizens and control them as they want.
1333084807249719297 2020-11-30 00:26:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It's called cheating - corruption!
1333083606969954304 2020-11-30 00:21:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @TheLeoTerrell Leftists are taking over the Democrat Party. (note that I DON'T use the word Democratic which is an adjective - the noun is Democrat). Joe Biden if he ever actually gets into office is beholden to many factions including the CCP (Chinese Communist Party).
1333029379840954370 2020-11-29 20:45:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Where are the people who brought the story up in the first place? There has been virtually no mention of it anywhere except for the Australian newspaper headline.
1333025131048865792 2020-11-29 20:28:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I trust the UN LESS THAN DEMOCRATS whom I DON’T trust AT ALL.
1332848854023221250 2020-11-29 08:48:24 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @NoTrumpians @PWheeled @TuckerCarlson He put the election in the hands of the state legislature - obvious voter issues.
1332848482504351745 2020-11-29 08:46:56 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @NoTrumpians @PWheeled @TuckerCarlson Look it up!
1332846269316861952 2020-11-29 08:38:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> And this is from a Democrat; I thought there were no honest ones left but maybe there is.
1332834407896518657 2020-11-29 07:51:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @PWheeled @NoTrumpians @TuckerCarlson That “right...” guy has a terminal case of TDS.
1332834097790668801 2020-11-29 07:49:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @NoTrumpians @PWheeled @TuckerCarlson I choose to reserve judgement. From your “supreme confidence” though, I wonder if you were involved along with other Trump haters in the cheating. It wouldn’t surprise me. A state judge in Pa. just ruled in Trump’s favor.
1332826574136225793 2020-11-29 07:19:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @PWheeled @NoTrumpians @TuckerCarlson I definitely donated. Legal proceedings do cost.
1332690802426908673 2020-11-28 22:20:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Let’s hope they get to the bottom of this fiasco.
1332688542691192834 2020-11-28 22:11:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> And how many arrests were made for damage to@public property???
1332673505033400323 2020-11-28 21:11:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> You look for any tidbit f good news at this point.
1332669547111993345 2020-11-28 20:55:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> John has been solidly consistent.
1332502985629425664 2020-11-28 09:54:03 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JoeBiden Yes, she said “deplorable actions” but didn’t call you or your group deplorables as Hillary called Trump supporters 4 years ago. Remember, what goes around comes around. We don’t stoop to that low level; we attack the actions and not the person. Your actions will fail.
1332461078404542464 2020-11-28 07:07:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Going to go to Supreme Court.
1332450562110001154 2020-11-28 06:25:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> DON'T JUST READ THIS; THINK YOUR WAY THROUGH IT! Freedom and Spiritual Inheritance  https://t.co/VflleVRA9q via @CatholicThing
1332419456530853904 2020-11-28 04:22:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Bishopoftyler Ah if only we had more like you!
1332419243913191425 2020-11-28 04:21:17 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The Church is bigger than any Priest, Bishop or Pope because we have the Eucharist - the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. We as Catholics have a RESPONSIBILITY to call out any one who desecrates the good name of our Church.
1332369678837182473 2020-11-28 01:04:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @TuckerCarlson  Hey Tucker, any comments on the 104 page document in Sidney Powell’s law suit in Georgia. She filed a separate one in Michigan. The documents likely contain much of the evidence you were seeking. How about a follow-up on your FOX talk show?
1332363612430757893 2020-11-28 00:40:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We no longer have a REAL PRESS We have a lot of imposters masquerading as journalists. Real journalists SEEK TRUTH and are NOT BIASED, RUDE and otherwise contemptible. Real journalists don’t allow their EMOTIONS to TAINT THEIR PERSPECTIVE; w/Trump there is no hidden agenda!!!
1332312280374112257 2020-11-27 21:16:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JohnBat45131194 Are you by chance the same John Bates who went to Strake Jesuit?
1332311780392103936 2020-11-27 21:14:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Kerri88313965 I have been “bitten” more than once by the twitter autocorrect snake.
1332310201362489345 2020-11-27 21:07:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Check out what a real man - Governor DeSantis did in Florida. No enforcement of mask wearing.
1332305368857382912 2020-11-27 20:48:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> You can’t have MORE VOTES COUNTED THAN CAST.
1332297184763662336 2020-11-27 20:16:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Who was that low life impersonating an honest journalist? Oh I forgot, there aren’t any honest journalists left worthy of that name/title.
1332296709880295424 2020-11-27 20:14:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MishaOBrien18 Another point, join NRA; they do a lot to protect honest citizen gun owners.
1332296308628074496 2020-11-27 20:12:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Check out Colion Noir, he helps out people wanting details about gun ownership. There are a few papers you will need to fill out. They do an FBI background check and depending on the state/gun, you may have a waiting period b4 picking it up at the retailer. Ck out @MrColionNoir
1332295059656597507 2020-11-27 20:07:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> God bless him.
1332294740990185472 2020-11-27 20:06:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Amen!!!
1332294407157116928 2020-11-27 20:05:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SarahLhl Our churches must be defended. Regardless, in the end those attacking God and His Houses of worship or Icons/statues will pay a price they never imagined. Meanwhile it’s up to us to stop them.
1332140597084368896 2020-11-27 09:54:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Kerri88313965 O ??? Guess I’m a bit naive
1332133685144018956 2020-11-27 09:26:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Kerri88313965 Perhaps a mass exodus from twitter to Parker would send a message.
1332127223747391490 2020-11-27 09:00:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JohnBat45131194 @RobW1_ @TomFitton @Twitter LOL
1332127082277707777 2020-11-27 09:00:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Good comment, John.
1332087399778824192 2020-11-27 06:22:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @crlord14 @KDuffySr Always.
1331944450826833920 2020-11-26 20:54:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> So now, Cuomo shows his ANTI-SEMITISM. What can you expect from a FAKE CATHOLIC?  He would be a complete DICTATOR if he thought he could get away with it.
1331935269830975494 2020-11-26 20:18:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL. LET US ALL PUT ASIDE POLITICS FOR THIS ONE DAY.  https://t.co/NNFhXjPhhi
1331767281899216898 2020-11-26 09:10:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ArielDelMar6 @RSBNetwork Is RSBN on direcTV or only via internet?
1331764258233868290 2020-11-26 08:58:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Super meeting and I believe it OPENED SOME EYES. Too bad only OANN carried it w/o interruption.
1331754653659385857 2020-11-26 08:20:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It’s about time!
1331745969818525696 2020-11-26 07:45:56 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Great news!!!
1331709530670059522 2020-11-26 05:21:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> WAY PAST TIME TO GIVE CREDIT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR THIS ACCOMPLISHMENT.
1331709234501783554 2020-11-26 05:19:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @XArmandKleinX @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Beautiful meme.
1331708386971422724 2020-11-26 05:16:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Very true; as people testify many more eyes are opening.
1331707028050505732 2020-11-26 05:11:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Everyone should have watched the conference led by Penn State Senators. They let Giuliani present several witnesses and listened to the testimony that the judge wouldn’t even allow the team to present.
1331705306112544768 2020-11-26 05:04:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 😀
1331627719143124993 2020-11-25 23:56:03 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Yep, just like a bad dream - A NIGHTMARE!
1331578851953156096 2020-11-25 20:41:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Biden is bringing back the “status quo” and those closely associated with the deep state.
1331341149513060358 2020-11-25 04:57:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> There is just too much smoke for there not to be a fire burning below.
1331302494371188742 2020-11-25 02:23:43 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JoeBiden Your party started the demonizing 4 years by calling those of us voting/supporting President Trump a “BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.” That kind of talk doesn’t go down as something leading to bi-partisanship. Combined w/your policy proposals it’s a recipe for FAILURE.
1331301668319793152 2020-11-25 02:20:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JoeBiden Sorry Joe, it’s nothing personal; it’s your and the Democrat proposed policies that scare the hell out of many of us who are TRUE AMERICANS. We will do everything in our power to stop your RADICAL AGENDA. You should start by CALLING OFF YOUR ANTIFA/BLM THUGS.
1331272953087070210 2020-11-25 00:26:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @CaringAngel_1 Hey @jack - if you are truly a responsible American, you can’t just block that kind or overt threat. You must turn over ALL INFORMATION on that individual and ANTIFA to authorities starting with the FBI.
1331221173540188162 2020-11-24 21:00:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dbongino Thus far it’s all been swept under the rug by both MSM and authorities.
1331217961256939524 2020-11-24 20:47:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Allowing transition process to proceed is NOT certifying the election. That can’t be done before electoral college casts their votes.
1331216327772663815 2020-11-24 20:41:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KurtSchlichter @dodiewill2 Check out the video clip from 2005 on CNN no less about voting machines and Venezuela.
1330904667862261760 2020-11-24 00:02:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> She wasn’t “fired” but they clarified that she wasn’t on the Trump or Campaign payroll. She hasn’t billed them for either services or expenses.
1330903074500698115 2020-11-23 23:56:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I agree wholeheartedly. BTW, I believe SP stepped on some toes when she mentioned that some Republican politicians/congressmen may be involved in the vote altering/switching.
1330900113745715207 2020-11-23 23:44:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Definitely human intervention/manipulation.
1330898112236429316 2020-11-23 23:36:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Terrible - draconian tactics and violating rights.
1330864461356412930 2020-11-23 21:23:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dianeh15285 This is further supportive of Sidney Powell’s allegations.
1330864148603953153 2020-11-23 21:21:53 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This is very supportive of Sidney Powell’s allegations.
1330860553183645696 2020-11-23 21:07:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Very good; I read her story elsewhere last night and believe it is completely legitimate. I’m sure there are others who just got “sucked in” by all the leftist &amp; MSM lies.
1330855943693885441 2020-11-23 20:49:17 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We really need to get to the bottom of this. It’s causing division not only amongst the electorate but also within the team.
1330681300399910912 2020-11-23 09:15:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Does not compute!
1330668851533647874 2020-11-23 08:25:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That may be the sentiments of many.
1330668036458749952 2020-11-23 08:22:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 @SaveOur1st @whobedannyd That comment almost went right past me; a look at the meme made it very clear. lol
1330664540439195649 2020-11-23 08:08:43 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @TheRISEofROD Her position is to first ensure the integrity of our voting process. That should be a BIPARTISAN ISSUE and big concern. In the process of doing so she’s uncovered gross discrepancies in favor of Biden that gave him votes.
1330662146376654848 2020-11-23 07:59:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Many smaller businesses will be forced to close. It’s expensive enough as it is today to go out to eat and it’s mostly due to high labor costs. Those jobs used to be filled by students and not primary wage earners.
1330648808737353733 2020-11-23 07:06:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> HOW TO BE A GOOD DEMOCRAT. Vote in as many locations as possible and as frequently as possible. If Democrats are/were honest, they would be joining Sidney Powell to ensure the integrity of the election process.
1330627410849648644 2020-11-23 05:41:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 @whobedannyd I think we all need some lighthearted interaction. Things have been a bit heavy lately.
1330625384275128320 2020-11-23 05:33:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 @whobedannyd That looks more like a blow torch than a flame thrower.
1330625146021957635 2020-11-23 05:32:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 @whobedannyd With Danny of the left and me on the right and you in the middle with that flame thrower, who would want to mess with us?
1330624578046078976 2020-11-23 05:29:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 @whobedannyd Hey, just be glad you have friends like us.
1330622061920866312 2020-11-23 05:19:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @whobedannyd @dodiewill2 Ha, ha, ha; you too know Dodie very well.
1330621872602574849 2020-11-23 05:19:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Gotta burn that underbrush.
1330621647708184579 2020-11-23 05:18:17 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Imagination!!! A good one!
1330617917835186177 2020-11-23 05:03:27 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SidneyPowell1 Please keep us posted on how the fundraising is going. I’ve donated $100 plus have been promoting the cause.
1330617461104930826 2020-11-23 05:01:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @thetoyman1 @SidneyPowell1 @LLinWood @RudyGiuliani @JennaEllisEsq @realDonaldTrump I’ve added my money in place of my mouth (tweets).
1330616624630657025 2020-11-23 04:58:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Go get’em  girl!  I think I sense some flames building. 🔥🔥🔥
1330614260007919617 2020-11-23 04:48:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> All hands on deck. Doughboys to the front. Get AND stay prepared.
1330612755045507075 2020-11-23 04:42:57 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Both very good questions.
1330612625999351808 2020-11-23 04:42:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That’s far bigger than any Russian influence.
1330612197458898945 2020-11-23 04:40:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @TrumpJeBrigade Please follow back and retweet pertinent tweets for broader distribution.
1330549932386816001 2020-11-23 00:33:18 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Thanks! My challenge to all - donate whatever you can and let your conscience be your guide. I just donated $100 plus a $3.30 processing fee. Help as you are able.
1330547232936955911 2020-11-23 00:22:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ByronYork @sm00_smith I replied in a retweet quote.
1330547089898676231 2020-11-23 00:22:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I respectfully disagree with you Brit. The MSM has clearly demonstrated an agenda refusing to even acknowledge the possibility that Sidney Powell’s case has merit. When fractional votes in tallies are found, that alone is evidence of manipulation. That’s a fact!
1330546162319888386 2020-11-23 00:18:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I love it! Thanks for all your support and all you do Senator Cruz. STAND STRONG!! We need to take our country back from the elitist “ruling class” cabal.
1330540188905451521 2020-11-22 23:54:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It’s time for all of us to take to the streets around the country and DEMAND this election be COMPLETELY audited. Without special programming of the entering or counting process, there is NO WAY THAT A COMPUTER SUMMATION CAN YIELD FRACTIONAL VOTES. THATS an INDISPUTABLE fact!!!
1330538323279044616 2020-11-22 23:47:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We are all praying that enough proof is there. We already believe based on all the circumstantial evidence and affidavits giving sworn testimony of wrongdoing.
1330537712810680323 2020-11-22 23:44:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Very much due to President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed. Give credit where credit is due!
1330537238925611009 2020-11-22 23:42:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> There is overwhelming anecdotal evidence based on many doctors reports on the efficacy of the hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and zinc “cocktail” in early treatment of CV-19. Also we cannot dismiss the low # of cases in Africa where HCQ is commonly used to treat malaria.
1330494382605266944 2020-11-22 20:52:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Let’s make this go viral. Twitter should not be blocking this material even if someone’s opinion.
1330492432585269248 2020-11-22 20:44:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Time for citizens to stand up for our rights. It is supposed to be a government of the people, for the people , by the people. NOT a government AGAINST or to CONTROL the people. STAND IN THE GAP!
1330162992609185801 2020-11-21 22:55:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This is how Democrats operate. When they don’t get their way, they threaten even families and children.
1330162552513454084 2020-11-21 22:54:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We must stop the Biden agenda of SOCIALISM or we will soon become a communist country.

1329888917726834688 2020-11-21 04:46:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Democrats think they are dictators.
1329771072133214210 2020-11-20 20:58:24 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Interesting but since I live in Texas, not many here willing to say they voted for the loser (at least in this state).

1329608585458937857 2020-11-20 10:12:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I’ve always watched and liked Tucker but realistically he can’t expect Sidney Powell or any lawyer to give out evidence on a talk show. That is reserved for court when that evidence is presented. I’m amazed that Tucker thought she would. You’re losing your fans, Tucker!

1329586221866217472 2020-11-20 08:43:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Good point.
1329585438949044228 2020-11-20 08:40:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @iamrobineublind @JennaEllisEsq You are obviously unaware of how one sided our national MSM (Main Stream Media like CNN, MSNBC, etc). Today the MSM is primarily a propaganda sheet for the Democrat party. They operate like PRAVDA - the official old USSR Communist Party mouthpiece.
1329584382257082368 2020-11-20 08:36:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SkyNews What a ridiculous waste of reporting time!  That is what is COMMONLY KNOWN AS PETTY!
1329573868558807041 2020-11-20 07:54:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @scotty_kiker I found this video to be truthful and substantiated by several other sources v
1329573619949776899 2020-11-20 07:53:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @scotty_kiker Only twitter and some Democrats are disputing this. Again, who and on what basis is this being disputed. Twitter owes it to its users (who bring advertising revenue) to state a REAL BASIS if any. Otherwise drop the ARBITRARY DISPUTE CLAIM.
1329562813745033219 2020-11-20 07:10:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Those are communist tactics but it’s what you can expect from Democrats.
1329531678914715649 2020-11-20 05:07:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> THIS IS NOT VOTER SUPPRESSION, THIS IS ENSURING THE INTEGRITY OF OUR VOTING.
1329531432784498688 2020-11-20 05:06:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Businessmen can rearrange their schedules to vote in early voting. The same for doctors, lawyers etc. THE INTEGRITY OF OUR VOTING SYSTEMS DEPEND ON IT.
1329531431626870785 2020-11-20 05:06:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> With early voting available to all, there is no reason for anyone other than military personnel stationed away from their home of record to vote absentee. Politicians need to come home fm DC and see constituents anyway - they can time visits for early voting.
1329531430569979911 2020-11-20 05:06:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> HOW TO CURE OUR ELECTION ILLS: 1. Mandatory voter ID 2. Voting in person w/each voter fingerprinted &amp; vote stamped. 3. Only military personnel allowed absentee vote - ballot to have fingerprint on it. 4. Absolutely no voter harvesting. 5. All votes verified/counted by bi-partisan
1329523818868695042 2020-11-20 04:35:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Time to tell the TRUTH and give this man his due credit.

1329482218272681984 2020-11-20 01:50:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @loraperu @Bishopoftyler AGREE 100%!!!
1329482077855756292 2020-11-20 01:50:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @david24261 @Bishopoftyler No, the Trump supported Catholic teaching in THE most IMPORTANT WAY. Unfortunately, some Bishops don't seem to understand the PRIORITIES. Bishop Strickland has it right; there are some non-negotiables. Immigration is purely a choice; the unborn don't get to choose.
1329481268090826754 2020-11-20 01:46:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Thank You!  Interestingly, some people cannot get it through their heads that ABORTION IS taking the life of a HUMAN BEING - it is not JUST A CLUMP OF CELLS - it is the very beginning of a human life. THAT IS A BIOLOGICAL FACT!!!
1329480648877371396 2020-11-20 01:44:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @musicman495 @Bishopoftyler You sir, are grossly misinformed; for example, 66%+ of the bishops said that Abortion was the pre-imminent issue of our time. Your opinion is being formed by the fact that only a few bishops and priests speak out firmly on this subject.
1329480096705622017 2020-11-20 01:42:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Thank  you; you are more kind that I am on this.
1329479944183951364 2020-11-20 01:41:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @PauGonzalez323 @Bishopoftyler If  you honestly believe Trump bears responsibility for those 250,000 deaths, you are grossly misinformed. Please go to the CDC reports and also check out NY, NJ and a few other states where the governors ordered the hospitals to send elderly back to nursing homes.
1329479331026972678 2020-11-20 01:39:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @PauGonzalez323 @Bishopoftyler You mean in the cages built by Obama/Biden administration in 2014? That practice was ordered stopped by Trump not long after he became president.
1329478946153508866 2020-11-20 01:37:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Truthtodiefor @Bishopoftyler Yes, Joe Biden has OPENLY sinned against the teachings of the Catholic Church w/o asking for forgiveness and repenting. Those sins are supporting abortion and performing gay marriages for starters. I have no idea what others but those are clearly in the open.
1329477958017323009 2020-11-20 01:33:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @amybabs511 @Bishopoftyler We won't accept an election tainted by cheating. If you are honest about your comment, ask Biden to join in the recounting and investigation of cheating so that we eliminate any question over it. Otherwise, please look at all the evidence of cheating/corruption in the voting.
1329477438317993992 2020-11-20 01:31:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Donna33406503 @Bishopoftyler Go back and read the 1st Amendment; it says that government must stay out of the church; NOWHERE does it say that the church MUST not exert influence over government. Read it carefully!
1329477005168025601 2020-11-20 01:29:53 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Donna33406503 @Bishopoftyler WRONG! There is just too much evidence of tampering and fraud in this election to call it over. Further, it isn't over until the electors do their job on December 14.
1329476596487622658 2020-11-20 01:28:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Thank you Bishop Strickland. We need more Bishops like you to stand up for out TRUE Catholic Faith. Many Catholics today question the leadership of the Church. NOTE; not questioning the Church but much of the leadership.
1329473588412428288 2020-11-20 01:16:18 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Today's Democrat Party has become like sheep. In the 1940's &amp; 50s, Texas was essentially a one party state. There were Conservative Democrats and Liberal Democrats so it worked reasonably well. Today, there seem to be ONLY LIBERAL DEMOCRATS; there ALL walk in LOCK-STEP.
1329472784184078336 2020-11-20 01:13:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Anything less is SHEER PROPAGANDA which of course is what the Democrat Party along with MSM has become - ONE GIANT PROPAGANDA MACHINE. YES, one since they walk in "lock-step" just like Hitler's NAZI's.

1329404347533451264 2020-11-19 20:41:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Yes, same here.
1329404227383386115 2020-11-19 20:40:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> NM Sheriffs met and swore allegiance to the constitution basically telling that governor they wouldn’t enforce her rules. I saw some NY sheriffs going the same.
1329134896200159233 2020-11-19 02:50:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MargaretJCofer Operation “Warp Speed” had much to do with the rapid development of the vaccine. Don’t forget Trump’s getting all those companies to produce ventilators for NY and sent the  Navy hospital ship to assist yet Cuomo bad- mouths him.
1329051256808157185 2020-11-18 21:18:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This is really big if the details are substantiated. Let’s hope &amp; pray that it proves out.
1329047350124433414 2020-11-18 21:02:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Is it time for a class action suit against big tech and specifically twitter? @tedcruz  @LLinWood  @SidneyPowell1  I’m sure there are many lawyers whose accounts have been censored/restricted in some way by twitter.  Please make screen shot &amp; re-tweet.
1329043080725602307 2020-11-18 20:45:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I agree with you about Fox News in general, but I have found that “Fox &amp;  Friends” in the early mornings has been supportive of Trumps challenge of the election results. Re - Tucker, I haven’t seen what you referred to in you r earlier tweet. He’s always supt’d when I’m watching
1329033658305536001 2020-11-18 20:08:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> There was/is corruption through this election.
1329031730087538690 2020-11-18 20:00:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That’s BS; he knew exactly what he was doing but thinks he’s above the rest.
1329031267426447361 2020-11-18 19:58:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Well said!  And appropriate.
1328868401142505472 2020-11-18 09:11:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Begin with Pelosi.
1328865198325764096 2020-11-18 08:58:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The more I see, the more I think much of this election should be thrown out. Radical? Yes but may well be best solution.
1328775890088714242 2020-11-18 03:03:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> THE PERSECUTION has started!!! You can see what extent the "CABAL" will go to silence/punish whistleblowers. Where the hell are the whistleblower protection laws? I guess those only apply to a DEMOCRAT who then gets special protection.
1328774173552992257 2020-11-18 02:57:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I'm comfortable standing with Candace. She is spot on.
1328743653007876097 2020-11-18 00:55:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @chic_savage @DNC That’s also the 2nd time Obama jumped to conclusion to pre-judge the police before all the facts were in. As I recall the officer involved went thru hell b4 being exonerated.
1328740388564295682 2020-11-18 00:42:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This is the kind of hatred inspired/instigated by Democrats in their unrelentless   attacks against President Trump &amp; his supporters. Pelosi, Maxine Waters and former AG Holder come to mind over the past 4 years.
1328738835472265218 2020-11-18 00:36:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Time for DC police to arrest this woman. She should be charged with domestic terrorism based on her observed actions. The evidence has been captured.
1328737906580729858 2020-11-18 00:32:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Time for action!!!
1328683912625856512 2020-11-17 20:58:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ONSEC_PTY_LTD Amazing! But if they died of old age they couldn’t list it as a Covidvirus death.

1328681511776874497 2020-11-17 20:48:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Jesse18957642 @CTruthforTrump The sad issue is that so@many ignorant Americans listen to MSM and really don’t understand what has been happening. They actually BELIEVE all the MSM misinformation and half-truths. Half-truths are worse than outright lies as they distort the truth.
1328679456043651072 2020-11-17 20:40:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> TRANSLATED Obama’s comments do not mean “inform better” but DO MEAN INDOCTRINATE BETTER.
1328676094787145728 2020-11-17 20:27:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That is what the Great Reset is!  It isn’t about making this a better world; IT IS about taking away people’s ringgit and making everyone a “slave” of the state. DON’T BE DECEIVED! Be informed!
1328675384020389888 2020-11-17 20:24:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This is the forerunner of a ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT under which the ELITISTS rule and all personal rights will be taken away. It is being done so gradually that you won’t notice. Trump got in the way and that’s why WEALTHY ELITISTS hate him. They WANT CONTROL!
1328673616909754375 2020-11-17 20:17:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This says it all.    https://t.co/f0BS4VEOzK
1328486226010263552 2020-11-17 07:52:53 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KrisNoel65 @LaraLeaTrump The "lies" are what is produced by the DNC in collusion with MSM feed to people like you who will believe anything. Trump was given hardball questions while Biden was asked what flavor ice cream he bought when he did actually present himself in front of the press.
1328485667068850183 2020-11-17 07:50:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KrisNoel65 @LaraLeaTrump There you go resorting to vulgarity. That always happens with leftists. H1N1 policy was a failure by Obama's white house staffer even said they did everything wrong. They were lucky in that H1N1 wasn't as lethal as CV-19.
1328484429552115713 2020-11-17 07:45:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KrisNoel65 @LaraLeaTrump Your arguments are all EMOTION! It's a waste of my time to argue with someone who isn't capable of recognizing truth or seeking it.
1328484176522326027 2020-11-17 07:44:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KrisNoel65 @LaraLeaTrump I'll say this for you; you make a "good" democrat. You simply espouse all the twisted rhetoric you hear on all your left wing media. I would take you on for a battle of wits but I can already see you are unarmed with real facts.
1328483766126436354 2020-11-17 07:43:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KrisNoel65 @LaraLeaTrump I give as much credit to "Mother Jones" as I do to CNN (Communist News Network). No wonder your thinking is so WARPED! You've been listening to all the communist oriented propaganda machines. Exactly what PRAVDA did in the 1950's for the old Soviet Socialists Republic.
1328483125203177479 2020-11-17 07:40:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KrisNoel65 @LaraLeaTrump You need to check your facts. The CDC report even states that no more than 6% of the deaths were solely caused by Covid. All of the rest involved various co-morbidities. Stick to REAL facts if you want to try to discuss things.
1328482692757860357 2020-11-17 07:38:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KrisNoel65 @LaraLeaTrump No one bows down to him; most of his followers stand for the flag and bow down to Jesus AND kneel before Him. It is totally ridiculous to blame any Covid deaths on Trump. The governors of 4 states ARE directly responsible for sending 1/2 of those who died back into nursing homes.
1328482045727805442 2020-11-17 07:36:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KrisNoel65 @LaraLeaTrump Gee, it sounds to me that you might actually living under Sharia Law.
1328481887027949569 2020-11-17 07:35:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KrisNoel65 @LaraLeaTrump Yes, he did initially use the cages BUILT IN 2014 AND HEAVILY UTILIZED BY OBAMA AND HIS HENCHMEN. Note that Obama deported Mexicans at the rate of about 2,000,000/year. Trump got the Mexican gov't to stop the migrations b4 they got to our border.
1328480933033467909 2020-11-17 07:31:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KamalaHarris You mean picking your own choice of "experts." The best Doctors I know seek second opinions and recommend others do the same. What you want in reality is to try to have COMUINISTIC CONTROL of the population. YOUR VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT IS A VOTE TO GIVE UP YOUR FREEDOMS.
1328478407328477184 2020-11-17 07:21:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KrisNoel65 @LaraLeaTrump With your limited understanding of facts, you might do well to stick to serving soup. I judge Trump on what he has done in his recent past much as Jesus judged Paul on what he saw in him and not on what he had done persecuting Christians. Trump doesn't advocate killing babies!
1328477532451115011 2020-11-17 07:18:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KrisNoel65 @LaraLeaTrump Good for you but I suggest you read the history of the Apostles that Jesus Himself chose. One was a hated tax collector, another a thief who ultimately betrayed him. Then there is Paul who persecuted Christians. I respect those who FOLLOW THE TENETS of their professed belief.
1328475669777551367 2020-11-17 07:10:56 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Urbanpatriot1 @JennieKoo Thanks, I was hoping someone out there could further confirm what my information is.
1328472993639575569 2020-11-17 07:00:18 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KrisNoel65 @LaraLeaTrump Most TRUE Catholics consider Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and Andrew Cuomo to be CINO's - Catholic In Name Only. They do not follow the teachings of the True Catholic Church.
1328472691611901952 2020-11-17 06:59:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KrisNoel65 @LaraLeaTrump So! That is just his personal opinion and the opinion of many  other TRUE Catholics. Contrary to popular opinions, the Pope doesn't speak for all Catholics when he gives his personal opinions on political issues. Yes, I did say opinions (plural intentional).
1328471143792177156 2020-11-17 06:52:57 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SteelhorseQ They are already using the Covid crisis to do just that.  Turn people into sheep; hence the word sheeple.
1328470022222655489 2020-11-17 06:48:29 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It's all about the NWO - New World Order. Translated, it means making every country a SOCIALIST COUNTRY.
1328469776176394245 2020-11-17 06:47:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Good question; sounds a lot like "hope and change." We know what that meant NOW.
1328469111488311296 2020-11-17 06:44:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Open the doors and books!
1328469018840281088 2020-11-17 06:44:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> What is Georgia trying to hide? What happened to transparency?
1328439329077735426 2020-11-17 04:46:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @tommcintyre1947 Cuomo must GO!
1328438105691611137 2020-11-17 04:41:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gailsline Hope you watched all of the videos.
1328433675369897986 2020-11-17 04:24:03 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MAGAawe @GovMikeDeWine @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity Unless Biden joins in to clarify this election there will always be a black cloud of doubt hanging overhead.
1328433418221314049 2020-11-17 04:23:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> How can anyone endorse Biden as president elect in the face of so much evidence of voter fraud. Biden himself should be calling for and cooperating with a full investigation to eliminate any specter of a fraudulent election. If he had an OUNCE of HONESTY, HE WOULD.
1328410639174430724 2020-11-17 02:52:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @seanmdav You might want to verify your facts before tweeting. That's the kind of stuff we have seen too much of from CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS ET AL.
1328408921443348489 2020-11-17 02:45:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Climate change activists refuse to look at ALL THE FACTS &amp; focus on influence of man's activities on the climate - that is the miniscule part. All the others noted above have far more influence and we have no control over them. We should not take be taking extreme measures.
1328406634574606337 2020-11-17 02:36:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ChelseaClinton Hey hon, it's your "mommy" that never got over 2016. They may be shouting "Lock Her UP" but they aren't throwing bricks or setting her house on fire like ANTIFA AND BLM did in Portland and Seattle plus other locations.
1328406160450392067 2020-11-17 02:34:43 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Where is twitter's "disputed story" tag on this one?
1328405629585797120 2020-11-17 02:32:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @richiecastaldo @MattWalshBlog I'm sure that Matt is happy to know that you no longer follow him.
1328405370017112067 2020-11-17 02:31:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I stand with Matt Walsh and Candace Owens. It's high time we did away with TOXIC FEMINISTS who are complicit in the demise of our great country. Candace sums it up very well.
1328404883205197824 2020-11-17 02:29:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE TEXAN AND GREAT AMERICAN. Just sorry that I couldn't have joined my fellow Texan and the others there in DC. Another veteran for Trump!
1328399290532847616 2020-11-17 02:07:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The truth shall set us free!!!
1328399073880256516 2020-11-17 02:06:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Freedom to practice one's religious belief shall not be denied nor shall government endorse any form of religious practice. IT MUST BE ALLOWED!
1328397719350743040 2020-11-17 02:01:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> What has happened to Tony Bobulinski and Hunter Biden? It seems that both Hunter Biden and Tony Bobulinski have vanished.
1328395515055251456 2020-11-17 01:52:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Good question???
1328395155590754311 2020-11-17 01:51:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @rachellepavlova @ericmetaxas Another Globalist organization.
1328395042696933376 2020-11-17 01:50:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @VF_Dean @ericmetaxas The facts say it isn't false witness. Evidence exists in too many places to deny Soros involvement.
1328394749502513155 2020-11-17 01:49:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The TENTACLES OF GEORGE SOROS extend virtually everywhere. Otherwise, why did the the Fox interview get cut short when Newt Gingrich started to mention his name?
1328393075429924864 2020-11-17 01:42:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Guess that's what happens when you have a serious case of TDS?
1328392193669730309 2020-11-17 01:39:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> No more need be said; she has indicted herself about her hatred. And they say they want UNITY??? Does their LYING NEVER STOP?
1328327775875440640 2020-11-16 21:23:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We better hope like hell that they do. Otherwise we are all finished. PEOPLE I KNOW DO CARE AND ARE WILLING TO FIGHT FOR WHAT IS RIGHT.
1328326883503706113 2020-11-16 21:19:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> With the police union endorsements plus the large increase in Jewish, Hispanic and Black votes over previous, the “lead” being “given” to Biden is totally unbelievable.
1328326139132194816 2020-11-16 21:16:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Is that EGG I see all over Vittert’s face? What a loser!!!
1328319470750871552 2020-11-16 20:50:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I must say we have not experienced this abdication of duty here in Texas. Perhaps that is because perpetrators meet resistance IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER should they try their destruction here. DC, Portland &amp; Seattle are the most prominent areas where it happened.
1328318548863750144 2020-11-16 20:46:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The Dominion system was rejected by Texas as UNSTABLE and subject to hacking in October, 2019 (posted earlier w/headline of actual report). Combine that w/Hammer &amp; Scorecard used by CIA, does anyone NOT BELIEVE this election was compromised? DISPUTED OR NOT!!!
1328308062680195073 2020-11-16 20:04:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gene_sury Thank you for following up on my point. I should have actually  noted the entire remaining portion of The Bread of Life Discourse. I usually make note that Jesus spoke literally here while he spoke in parables (analogy) elsewhere like The Prodigal son.
1328168408773488645 2020-11-16 10:49:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Healing can start when the Democrat operatives start to crack down on these domestic terrorists and stop them from all the violence THEY perpetrate. It's very clear from the videos who is doing the antagonizing and it must stop.
1328168407351562246 2020-11-16 10:49:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> PATHETIC EXCUSE FOR NEWS MEDIA. I've seen the videos of attacks on the marchers for Trump in DC by both ANTIFA/BLM and they were brutal. It's time for our peaceful Republican marchers to appropriately arm themselves against these domestic terrorists. Lets call them what they are.
1328040666807607302 2020-11-16 02:22:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 2. In fact in the Bread of Life Discourse, Jesus refers to the bread and wine as his body and blood (no mere symbol as in when He speaks in parables when teaching). In fact, He REITERATES it in John 6: 51 "I am the living bread....." This is Jesus SPEAKING LITERALLY - NO SYMBOLS.
1328040665838706689 2020-11-16 02:22:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 1. Apostolic succession lesson: Priest's power to Forgive sins ; Jesus words are clear in  John 20: 20-23 - and Matt 18: 18 Regarding the real presence of Jesus in the Eucharist: Read John 6; 22-70 Bread of Life Discourse. There is no reference to the bread and wine as symbols.
1328031419336167425 2020-11-16 01:45:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We need to eliminate the Confucius Institutes from all our universities.
1328028545206149120 2020-11-16 01:34:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KrisNoel65 @LaraLeaTrump And I will judge you for your lack of knowing who you voted for. You haven't looked into your candidate, Joe Biden deeply enough. He met with his present wife for example before she was divorced from her husband at the time. (His statement). Just wait until the hammer drops.
1328027582722428928 2020-11-16 01:30:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Bassfishing221 @LaraLeaTrump You did see them; they were the ones attacking old ladies carrying a Trump or American flag or sucker punching an old grey haired man from BEHIND or otherwise those voicing their rights in a peaceful march.
1328026778502303745 2020-11-16 01:27:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @haylo64 @LaraLeaTrump It isn't over until at least Dec. 14 when the electoral college meets to cast their votes.
1328026592791171072 2020-11-16 01:26:27 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @FrankAmari2 @LaraLeaTrump @PressSec Hey, @jack - where is your comment about this being not only a disputed statement but a VERY STRONGLY DISPUTED STATEMENT.  Frank Amari just insulted over half (yes over half) of the American population. Over half because the REAL VOTE for Trump would have been that w/o cheating.
1328025772561469444 2020-11-16 01:23:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @FrankAmari2 @LaraLeaTrump @PressSec All I can say is that you are one VERY, VERY SICK MAN - MENTALLY. Those you describe are your FELLOW DEMOCRATS who lie, cheat, a nd otherwise DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO REMAIN IN  POWER. You don't know the meaning of the work HONESTY!
1328025217826951170 2020-11-16 01:21:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> AND THERE ARE MANY, MANY MORE WHO COULD NOT MAKE IT THERE.
1328024632444792835 2020-11-16 01:18:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @shimoda_don @Chrisssmustang Absolutely, we cannot allow them to be over run by thugs of any description. We cannot be concerned about Peace in the WORLD when we can't even have peace in our cities.
1328022555203080192 2020-11-16 01:10:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @social_media_sm @Bishopoftyler You judge where you don't know/understand. There are maladjusted people in every walk of life. Don't judge the whole Catholic Church by the actions of a few bad priests/bishops. The Houston Chronicle once had a full half front page of Baptist perpetrators; I don't judge Baptists.
1328021603842666497 2020-11-16 01:06:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Amen to that; we need those like Bishop Strickland and Father Altman to STAND IN THE GAP.
1328021312074379264 2020-11-16 01:05:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> There are many CINO's -Catholics in Name Only - today. For a true picture of what Catholicism is and what it is meant to be, listen to Bishop Strickland, Tyler, TX or Father Altman. The truth sometimes stings but we don't need a "Feel Good" church. That's fake Christianity.
1328020397057581057 2020-11-16 01:01:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Nor is our Church a "Feel Good" church. We cannot accept the teaching of those who treat our Church as a smorgasbord religion to pick and choose as Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and Andrew Cuomo do. You can't call yourself a golfer if you don't adhere to the rules of golfing.
1328019101743247363 2020-11-16 00:56:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> And the time is passing rapidly.
1328018764823203840 2020-11-16 00:55:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Bishopoftyler Our current Pope would do well to listen to that advice rather than the advice he has apparently been listening to.
1328018528419672069 2020-11-16 00:54:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> All should heed this advice.
1328017599570079746 2020-11-16 00:50:43 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I like our Governor Abbott in Texas but I think I may even like Ron DeSantis even more. I generally agree with what he says when on the news.
1328016228506624002 2020-11-16 00:45:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @beki007s Stand strong and stand together and be prepared to defend ourselves wherever we are.
1328012170844655618 2020-11-16 00:29:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Call for throwing out ALL ballots in Philadelphia and a revote with OUTSIDE SUPERVISION not from anyone in Philadelphia.
1328011583327514627 2020-11-16 00:26:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> A thorough OUTSIDE investigation of the Mayor of Philadelphia and everything that went on at those vote counting locations is mandatory.
1328008480205262848 2020-11-16 00:14:29 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Update; approximately 700 in attendance; Tim Tebow's mother was the featured speaker and what a story she told about being told to abort Tim when she was pregnant with him. How anyone can agree to have an abortion is way beyond anything I can imagine. It is a most GRUESOME ACT.
1328005973018112002 2020-11-16 00:04:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This evidence needs to be brought out into the open.
1328005521086025728 2020-11-16 00:02:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> New Yorkers, you are no longer free Americans. You are under the dictatorship of Andrew Cuomo and Bill de Blasio living in a SOCIALIST DICTATOR SUB-COUNTRY. You  have allowed these two Nazis to take total control of your city and state.
1327959000101625856 2020-11-15 20:57:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Bricklebear1 @PrideNews1 We will be peaceful unless/until harassed or outright attacked. If attacked, WE WILL RETALIATE WITH FULL FORCE in defending ourselves. We do not instigate and prefer to be peaceful but our views/demands WILL BE HEARD.
1327956582777442305 2020-11-15 20:48:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Fox is like an aggressive dog that gets challenged and turns &amp; tucks his tail while running away. They have lost it.
1327955877589098497 2020-11-15 20:45:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gailsline Most definitely.
1327955725755224066 2020-11-15 20:44:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Update; we had 700 people with majority over their 60’s.
1327945846038597643 2020-11-15 20:05:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> There are a couple of others as well. I watched Lou Dobbs interview of Sidney Powell and he was very supportive.

1327707145475928065 2020-11-15 04:17:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Amen to that!
1327671446840242176 2020-11-15 01:55:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> What better evidence than an eye witness?

1327380995901956096 2020-11-14 06:41:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> He is not president elect until the votes are certified and the electoral college make the selection on Dec. 14.
1327361572889571328 2020-11-14 05:23:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @RyanAFournier @TrumpinOn2020 “Young lady” you need to take off the blinders and open your eyes. If you believe in God ask him to take control of your life and guide you and your thoughts. Figure it out!!!
1327338807214157829 2020-11-14 03:53:27 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @scotty_kiker @gatewaypundit Ultimately the courts are going to decide and they may or may not accept these allegations as evidence.
1327322440280764418 2020-11-14 02:48:24 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @thetoyman1 Sorry to hear that David. I've been having neck pain on the left back side and my GP said she thinks it's a pinched nerve. Also having lower back pain on either side of where I had surgery &amp;hardware inserted 2 years ago. Sometimes growing old means pain so we have to deal w/it.
1327318488810205187 2020-11-14 02:32:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Hey, ck out your dm. I sent a more private message there that I think you’ll like/appreciate.
1327314923102363649 2020-11-14 02:18:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Come on Dodie; you know there is nothing good about Joe. He isn’t even a genuine Catholic; he’s only a CINO. (for political purposes - but many of see through him.)
1327313282672320512 2020-11-14 02:12:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Fox doesn’t need a PR company; they need to clean house starting with Rupert Murdoch’s son &amp; his wife and following w/Chris Wallace, Juan Williams, Donna Brazile and Lisa Kennedy Montgomery. Those 6 are BRAZENLY &amp; clearly anti-Trump. HUGE BIAS!!!
1327302784543318017 2020-11-14 01:30:18 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Round 1; now on to the next rounds.
1327302606423781376 2020-11-14 01:29:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> He tried to come into Texas too but were STILL RED! His name is George Soros but he has some assistants.
1327289836160622592 2020-11-14 00:38:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Thanks Dodie, you lit that🔥under me again.
1327289676579876871 2020-11-14 00:38:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> He was outdone by the Chinese using HAMMER &amp; SCORECARD on the Dominion Voting System which was REJECTED BY TEXAS in reviewing their system in Oct. 2019. There is a whole story behind this.
1327239281962782726 2020-11-13 21:17:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Better_4_US @SLT20201 @AOC They tried that in Texas flooding Ted Cruz’s opponent, Beto, 2 years ago but were REJECTED. Georgia voters should do the same. DON’T LET OUTSIDERS DETERMINE WHO YOUR SENATORS WILL BE.
1327236213787549697 2020-11-13 21:05:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Yes, definitely.
1327235075575066624 2020-11-13 21:01:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ScottWalker Scott, you did a nice factual summary of just a few of the good things Trump accomplished. Unfortunately, Democrats have sown so much hate and distortion assisted by MSM that people rather believe the lies than look at facts. Those who did switched and voted for Trump.
1327234268708429830 2020-11-13 20:58:03 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Kristenmaybe @ScottWalker Wrong, we’re nowhere near that 100k number and we definitely saw our taxes go down. Perhaps you live in a state with a high state income tax. My state does not have a state income tax.
1327233500429357057 2020-11-13 20:54:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @HereToResist @ScottWalker Everything you list is conjecture. You cannot legitimately the coronavirus RELATED dearth’s on Trump. For the rest of your comments, the exact opposite is true.
1327232895296081921 2020-11-13 20:52:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Thank you Aly; you were much nicer than I was. It’s a long shot but Trump still could win.
1327232578055794689 2020-11-13 20:51:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MFreisberg @ScottWalker We are a divided country because of those like you who apparently support the far left and late term abortions, socialism, radical environmentalism. 72+ million people supported Trump &amp; if the Dominion system wasn’t used he would have won already. Audits will determine.
1327066637674172416 2020-11-13 09:51:56 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Eye opening information! During review/testing of:  Voting System Examination Dominion Voting Systems Democracy Suite 5.5-A Prepared for the Secretary of State of Texas James Sneeringer, Ph.D. Designee of the Attorney General Recommendation: Certification  should be denied.
1327060713479806976 2020-11-13 09:28:24 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That alone raises the level of suspicion.
1327059299688968193 2020-11-13 09:22:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Just like now “they” are saying there is no evidence all while computer experts are saying what happened in Michigan and is being called a “glitch” had to be actually intervention w/respect to the counting votes. No computer program would ARBITRARILY FLIP VOTES  from A to B.
1327027157420433408 2020-11-13 07:15:03 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Keep in mind that virtually every case that goes before a judge in court is "disputed" by one party or the other. In criminal cases, the defendant pleads either guilty or not guilty. If he pleads not guilty, it's disputed and resolved before a judge and jury. Twitter is NEITHER!
1327026593081024514 2020-11-13 07:12:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It seems Twitter and MSM think that by simply calling allegations "disputed" they will just go away &amp; make readers think they aren't true. True or not, they need to be thoroughly investigated which both entities appear to want to discourage. All we want is clean/fair elections.
1327023954503069697 2020-11-13 07:02:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Passing a law is just one step; it has to have TEETH in the enforcement mechanism.
1326919468950429698 2020-11-13 00:07:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gailsline @Bud_Doggin @realDonaldTrump Neat!!!
1326874384007651329 2020-11-12 21:07:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @mpredli @ScottFishman No, he is a professor at MIT but does not buy into lift wing policies so gets labeled as a conspiracy theorist. He has detailed his findings.
1326873852786454528 2020-11-12 21:05:53 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @DSimpsonswfl @ScottFishman I posted the video yesterday and it should still be available on my homepage @JuliusMaresh
1326722898611105794 2020-11-12 11:06:03 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @loraperu Be sure to retweet my commentaries. I’m only one person but when we retweet, our views get spread far and wide.
1326719438385803265 2020-11-12 10:52:18 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The press, MSM, is complicit in perpetuating the Biden crime family. They will eventually be fully exposed. BTW what has happened to Tony Bobulinski? The press should be asking/investigating.
1326718573616783364 2020-11-12 10:48:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I’m calling out @jack to explain WHY and on what basis twitter is disputing this claim. Let’s see something equal to Dr. Shiva’s assertions. Anything less is empty disputing and valueless. Just a smokescreen.
1326700752438501377 2020-11-12 09:38:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We have a new name for Gov. Cuomo, it’s “Little Hitler!” He is little (mentally) &amp; Hitleresque in his draconian edicts. He’s worse than Scrooge!
1326698172719243265 2020-11-12 09:27:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I love it!  We could add “DON’T MESS WITH TEXAS.”
1326695822571016194 2020-11-12 09:18:27 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Felicitas4Truth My wife just made the same comment noting that we know some Californians that moved here but brought their (at least some) liberal ideology with them. You would think they would understand but perhaps they were transferred here and didn’t come of their own volition.
1326693782839025665 2020-11-12 09:10:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Time to move the stock exchanges to Texas where we appreciate businesses AND DON’T TAX THEM TO DEATH. There is also NO STATE INCOME TAX. We do have a sales tax but you’re only taxed IF YOU SPEND and not before. That puts YOU in control. Just leave your liberal ideology behind.
1326691992303247363 2020-11-12 09:03:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Wish we could be there in person but since we can’t, we will be with you in spirit and prayers.
1326691280303386624 2020-11-12 09:00:24 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We love it, Kelly. Our prayers are with you. Don’t let those OUTSIDERS determine what happens in your state. They tried it in Texas 2 years ago with “Beto” bringing in huge sums of outside money but Ted Cruz prevailed.
1326688006087041024 2020-11-12 08:47:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Mistimoonbeam @DawnYaeger_01 @FLOTUS @USMC You are vile!
1326687762188300293 2020-11-12 08:46:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @DawnYaeger_01 @FLOTUS @USMC You, Dawn are disgusting and don’t have an ounce of class. As a matter of fact, o doubt you even know what class is. SAD!
1326685752382660608 2020-11-12 08:38:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> When we stand up for each other, we are in essence standing up for ourselves. We must be willing to give up our lives for our friends as Jesus did. Many already have - 400,000 died in WWII.
1326623649332400128 2020-11-12 04:31:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I presume all the switched votes and lost votes were in favor of Biden and against Trump. Correct?
1326621995665068032 2020-11-12 04:25:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I think we see a clear link to some manipulators with a motive here.
1326612312099352583 2020-11-12 03:46:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Not exactly you would expect for someone losing an election. EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FOR A WINNER (TRUMP).
1326595844003549185 2020-11-12 02:41:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Economic realities are even quite different from county to county in bigger states like Texas where $30,000/yr is a good living wage in a rural county but may require $70,000 in Harris, Dallas counties &amp; other large metropolitan city/areas. GET LOGICAL AND PRACTICAL.
1326595840002166784 2020-11-12 02:41:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 1. OPEN LETTER TO ALL HOUSE &amp; SENATE MEMBERS: leave the minimum wage decision to the states to decide for themselves. What May bee appropriate for HIGH COST STATES like NY &amp; California is not appropriate for many other states. LET EACH STATES ECONOMIC REALITY DETERMINE MIN WAGES.
1326593092103892995 2020-11-12 02:30:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I forgot to say 400 years ago TODAY!
1326592780257398793 2020-11-12 02:29:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> You can read whatever you want into that statement.
1326592507623387136 2020-11-12 02:27:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Democrats seem to forget the cry of many of our forefathers - GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH!  Without LIBERTY/FREEDOM the will to live soon dies.
1326589842868891648 2020-11-12 02:17:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gailsline Wow!
1326588989026021377 2020-11-12 02:13:56 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Without a thorough recount AND verification of every ballot in at least these contested states we have a MOCKERY of everything our forefathers fought so hard for. Not emotion, just FACT!
1326583355303997441 2020-11-12 01:51:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Hold on to OUR SENATE!!!
1326580480599330816 2020-11-12 01:40:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 3. Before you can legitimately call for unity, you must begin by SUPPORTING A FULL AUDIT AND RECOUNT OF VOTES IN ALL CONTESTED STATES. Voices of 75,000,000 American voters demand this. THEN &amp; ONLY THEN can you even begin to think of a call for unity.
1326580477164138496 2020-11-12 01:40:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 2. Your party members called for harassment of  his staff AND FAMILIES at every turn. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders &amp; Senator Ted Cruz were unable to have a peaceful meal in any DC restaurant. Several Democrat “LEADERS” including Maxine Waters called for harassment.
1326580472554655744 2020-11-12 01:40:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 1. @JoeBiden  Your calls for unity after both you and your Democrat (UN-DEMOCRATIC) party did everything in your power to thwart &amp; UNDERMINE President Trump in everything he worked so hard for RINGS HOLLOW.
1326574936476037121 2020-11-12 01:18:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> FOUR HUNDRED years ago the Mayflower landed at Plymouth Rock. On board was Stephen Hopkins, my wife’s 11th great grandfather. He was also one of the Mayflower pact.
1326559540867969025 2020-11-12 00:16:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Every Legal Vote  https://t.co/h33CZvTnHL
1326518543081500672 2020-11-11 21:34:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> To my followers, if you like my tweet, please re-tweet. Otherwise it dies on the vine
1326516372638142464 2020-11-11 21:25:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> OPEN LETTER TO THOSE MOVING TO TEXAS: When you move here, remember what makes Texas so great for businesses AND individuals. Leave your liberal Democrat ideology behind. If you bring that ideology with you, your move would be FUTILE. KEEP TEXAS RED!!!
1326514489215361024 2020-11-11 21:17:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Gov. Abbott invites Wall Street Stock Markets to move to Texas. Although there would big costs involved, those cost would be recovered in short order via much lower taxes. Individuals moving would also benefit greatly as Texas has no state income tax.
1326512907417477122 2020-11-11 21:11:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Thanks Danny.
1326512755394965504 2020-11-11 21:11:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> GOD BLESS AMERICA AND OUR VETERANS. SOME GAVE SOME; SOME GAVE ALL (their lives).
1326510173888851969 2020-11-11 21:00:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Let’s get the verifications in and end twitters “in dispute” claim. Time to verify and end dispute.
1326509445082451971 2020-11-11 20:57:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> OPEN LETTER TO ALL REPUBLICAN HOUSE &amp; SENATE MEMBERS: Remember what Democrats did to undermine President Trump. We cannot have a $15/hr min wage, NO Green New Deal initiatives, no repeal of Trump tax cuts. Remember at least 75,000,000 voted in support of Trump.
1326508312150634497 2020-11-11 20:53:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Time for Judge Jeanine, Hannity, Carlson &amp; Ingraham to switch to either OANN or Newsmax. That kind of move would TANK Fox News. Perhaps we could also get the Fox &amp; Friends team to move as well. It would be goodbye to Fox.
1326506940617330688 2020-11-11 20:47:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @HoToddi @JennieKoo The BIG QUESTION is why is Fox and MSM REFUSING to keep Americans informed regarding this information. Also what about the claims about Blockchain and watermarked ballots vs invalid non-watermarked ballots. How can anyone have ANY confidence in this election?  ZERO!!!
1326504634341584896 2020-11-11 20:38:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @realDonaldTrump Need confirmation to the following question. We’re ALL mail-in ballots required to be printed on water-marked paper? We know that paper currency is often counterfeited. That raises the specter of ballots being counterfeit.
1326497924323418112 2020-11-11 20:12:04 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Looks like this will be the first Veterans Day without all the celebrations on behalf of all of our veterans.
1326497484777132037 2020-11-11 20:10:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Thanks for the supporting info. Now for an actual verification of what I posted earlier.
1326497076977471488 2020-11-11 20:08:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I would like to see this independently verified but on the surface find it completely believable.
1326496558897127424 2020-11-11 20:06:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Can anyone verify this?
1326496089646751745 2020-11-11 20:04:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> My sentiments exactly. If it was an honest &amp; fair election, they have nothing to hide so should be encouraging the investigations.
1326327769224114182 2020-11-11 08:55:56 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @DudaPhillis @FLOTUS We just need someone to independently verify the information in my tweet. It seems plausible but I like verification by an independent source.
1326309190609084417 2020-11-11 07:42:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> And it appears that Fox just censored you. You should move to OANN or Newsmax. They would appreciate you there.
1326299992953409543 2020-11-11 07:05:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @VetApologist @gailsline I’ve sent an open request for someone to confirm it. Meanwhile, it’s very plausible.
1326279238111145985 2020-11-11 05:43:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The Church must be consistent in dealing with these situations.
1326255907232165888 2020-11-11 04:10:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @VoteRed53 @tommcintyre1947 That would be the next step if anyone can substantiate what is in the article.
1326252872548446208 2020-11-11 03:58:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Trump Win Validated by Quantum Blockchain System Recount of Votes  | Politics | Before It's News  https://t.co/5o6U9fRLaa
1326239776207499267 2020-11-11 03:06:17 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Very appropriate question.
1326239186295414792 2020-11-11 03:03:57 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> TWITTER Censors Announcement for MASSIVE PRO-TRUMP RALLY Saturday in Washington DC  https://t.co/9IokNYh5g9 via @gatewaypundit
1326237223273029633 2020-11-11 02:56:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Every state where discrepancies are found should be subject to a supervised recount.
1326226827006914568 2020-11-11 02:14:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That’s because the cheating occurred on the Democrat side.
1326226150889299970 2020-11-11 02:12:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Very suspicious behavior.
1326224804249264130 2020-11-11 02:06:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Total bias on their part.
1326150822917496833 2020-11-10 21:12:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Trump deserves credit for the rapid development of the CV-19 vaccine. Trump’s Operation Warp Speed led to competition between pharmaceutical companies leading to this short time to develop.
1326150018701660160 2020-11-10 21:09:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JoeBiden  It’s very easy for you to spout rhetoric about “coming together.” Thats all very noble but you seem to forget what you, Hillary &amp; Obama did for 4 years TO UNDERMINE President Trump who was LEGITIMATELY ELECTED. So no, you cannot expect our support.
1326149183116619776 2020-11-10 21:06:18 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @enolamsamoht @SharikaSoal84 Sorry, though you can “self identify” as whichever you choose, the BIOLOGICAL fact is that you are bi-racial and deserving of the same respect. As an American of Czech ancestry, I was made fun of by my WASP “friends.” You just live with it as a fact of life.
1326148218879668224 2020-11-10 21:02:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @BennySeattle @SharikaSoal84 Precisely; they are both bi-racial. I can only assume that they both felt it was politically advantageous to self identify as black in order to appeal to the black vote. If I was black, I would feel insulted by their identity politics. I prefer honesty like Vernon Jones shows.
1326147524785213443 2020-11-10 20:59:43 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @GelyVladimir @SharikaSoal84 I have one simple question for you to think about. If you are a police officer and a crime is reported to you, is it not important (as part of the perpetrator’s description) to know the color/ethnicity the same as height, weight and/or hair color? It narrows who it was.
1326145276625768448 2020-11-10 20:50:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @AnnikaSkywalker @SharikaSoal84 Agreed
1326145188805439491 2020-11-10 20:50:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pas_De_Ce_M0nde @SharikaSoal84 It’s no different in my opinion than describing someone by their hair color, height or body size. I’m thinking of having to accurately describe someone who commits a crime for example. If the suspect had red hair, you wouldn’t want to arrest someone with some other color.
1326144142330781697 2020-11-10 20:46:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gkiel @SharikaSoal84 I fully agree; Obama emphasized race to the point of making it divisive. While in the Army from 1960-1963, I shared quarters with both Hispanic and black AMERICANS. We lived like brothers which we all are in God’s eyes.
1326143264592982016 2020-11-10 20:42:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JoshuaLedford14 @SharikaSoal84 I agree; I am an American of Czech descent and never think of myself as Czech-American. Only when the conversation involves ancestry does it come up. If everyone simply calls themselves American AND reflects allegiance to this country, we will all be better off.
1326134411788742656 2020-11-10 20:07:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Democrats behavior makes perfect sense. They knew that their actions during the vote counting and mail in voting was ripe for fraud. Their actions of refusing to allow Republican observers alone raises the level of distrust.
1325979750117093377 2020-11-10 09:53:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Scaramucci @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump You are totally ridiculous. Development happened due to Trump’s Operation Warp Speed. You know that but you are simply vindictive over being FIRED as press secretary after only 2 weeks in the job. I can see why he fired you; you are a real loser!
1325978241149132801 2020-11-10 09:47:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh>  https://t.co/0dPdoGVthU
1325967059390492672 2020-11-10 09:02:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @fiatshredder @3days3nights There was no mass mail in voting so was much harder to cheat in 2016.
1325889035353649153 2020-11-10 03:52:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @kvwatchtay7 Don’t be too quick to rush to judgement. Remember, Trump put in place operation warp speed. He also motivated corporations to build ventilators w/o invoking the “War Powers Act” and not eliminated shortages but also provided them to other countries in need.
1325888230357676032 2020-11-10 03:49:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It’s entirely possible for Pfizer to have done this. Remember, flu vaccines are re-formulated to protect against the flu strain anticipated. Pfizer’s vaccine was developed for a very specific virus - CV-19.  I choose to reserve judgement.
1325887314787241990 2020-11-10 03:45:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Support the President as strongly as he supported all of us and MAGA!
1325851872515796996 2020-11-10 01:24:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Never ever give up; never ever give in!
1325851652189020166 2020-11-10 01:24:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> And it’s largely due to President Trump’s warp speed initiative. It’s beyond time to give Trump the CREDIT DUE HIM.
1325834529601441795 2020-11-10 00:15:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Definitely.
1325820179742416897 2020-11-09 23:18:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That isn’t the only evidence and MSM &amp; social media cover up trying to mislead voting public. They are only interested in pushing their narrative and NOT IN THE TRUTH.
1325804781676490752 2020-11-09 22:17:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> None of these facts translate into a Biden-Harris victory.
1325804778199392258 2020-11-09 22:17:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> FACTS: 1. Police unions endorsed &amp; voted for Trump.  2. Record numbers of Hispanics voted for Trump.  3. Record numbers of Blacks voted for Trump. 4. Very large crowds @ Trump rallies.  5. Economy was outstanding b4 Covid &amp; recovering strongly currently.
1325803395446353921 2020-11-09 22:12:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The ONLY way that public confidence will be restored on the election process is to have a thorough/transparent investigation of ALL the allegations of irregularities/fraud. NOTHING LESS WILL SATISFY VOTERS.
1325794516683673602 2020-11-09 21:36:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I think we all need some laughter. It’s time to start laughing at Biden-Harris &amp; the Democrats. They don’t know what we have in store for them.
1325794057143144449 2020-11-09 21:35:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 @JarlBlitzen That’s “ I be smart.”
1325776218902376448 2020-11-09 20:24:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Then there are the 450,000 votes with ONLY Biden’s name on the ballot. Again, not logical.

1325625266161541121 2020-11-09 10:24:27 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Sounds like some solid evidence to me.
1325623444596256768 2020-11-09 10:17:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It’s politics pure &amp; simple.
1325623305718673409 2020-11-09 10:16:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Agreed
1325623084095823872 2020-11-09 10:15:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Very sad!!!
1325567430928838658 2020-11-09 06:34:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I’m with you on this one Megyn. You are spot on. Democrats want to have it both ways.
1325567126132969472 2020-11-09 06:33:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MelAR05 @Austan_Goolsbee @megynkelly Democrats have been the most intolerant of all while preaching tolerance. ITS LIKE BIDEN &amp; PELOSI PROFESSING TO BE CATHOLICS BUT VIOLATING TWO OF THE MOST BASIC CATHOLIC BELIEFS. HYPOCRITES!!!
1325566544173281280 2020-11-09 06:31:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @horacelowe6 @RussellHoppy @Austan_Goolsbee @megynkelly Where was the peace &amp; unity when Democrats were doing all the sham attacks on Trump?  They certainly never offered to work together to CREATE UNITY on any of the issues needing resolution. So no, Dems can expect what they dished out in return. Republicans gave in for too long.
1325565147205824513 2020-11-09 06:25:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @USSANews People shouldn’t be jumping the gun. You would think EVERYONE would want this situation cleared up removing any reason for doubts.
1325564725409816577 2020-11-09 06:23:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> You are so right.
1325554062650191880 2020-11-09 05:41:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> You don’t spend 4 years bashing the President and his supporters and then ask them to not now resist you and your shenanigans.

I knew that NM was left leaning but Arizona &amp; Nevada are another story. Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and possibly Georgia appear to reflect the most irregularities.

1325470696370278402 2020-11-09 00:10:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @FoxNews You have lost all respect by your LACK OF OBJECTIVITY in this election.

1325224560749318145 2020-11-08 07:52:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Remember 1948. Newspapers published with headline “Dewey Defeats Truman” and we all know how that turned out. The way the vote counts changed for Biden defies all mathematical probabilities. It does not pass the smell test.
1325187400159555587 2020-11-08 05:24:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 I can imagine. I’m trying not to watch the developments but that’s virtually impossible. Watching college football today. I’m still contemplating what action I can take.

1325102468217311234 2020-11-07 23:47:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> As I stated elsewhere, we need a bi-partisan audit (auditors side by side) of ALL states where the vote was very close and especially in those states going heavily for Trump but flipped once mail-in votes were counted. Also any state using the software used in Michigan.
1325065027754352640 2020-11-07 21:18:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This isn’t an isolated case. Voting machine errors in not recording votes for Trump.

1325055569904930816 2020-11-07 20:40:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Additionally, more blacks, gays &amp; Hispanics in historic numbers voted for Trump. That can be &amp; has been verified. That alone leads to suspicion when Trump had significant leads that suddenly evaporated after mail-in votes began to be counted.
1325055567530962944 2020-11-07 20:40:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Trump voters didn’t resort to blocking observers in any Republican run counties. There are “ballot counters” who have come forward and signed affidavits stating they were ordered to change (back date) ballots.
1325053530193977345 2020-11-07 20:32:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It is also totally inconsistent with the “in-person” voting results. It smells worse than a hog pen. Phewww!
1324808855935766539 2020-11-07 04:20:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> How is it likely that the overwhelming ballots found are/were for Biden? That simply is illogical given the pattern of voting b4 THOSE WERE FOUND.

1324402650583048192 2020-11-06 01:26:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Follow the threads; there are other postings showing how many votes were not recorded in the tallies. The tally was compared to actual ballots processed and in one c'ty in Michigan only two Republican votes were recorded. A congressman stated he had 6 family members in that c'ty.
1324401659620007938 2020-11-06 01:22:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> There has been a lot of this kind of thing - INVALID BALLOTS - plus outright FRAUD. Unfortunately, fraud is very hard to prove but that doesn't prevent those fraudulent ballots from being thrown out.
1324400828724203520 2020-11-06 01:18:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This is precisely why we need an immediate investigation (FBI) and extensive audit of EVERYTHING that went on in Michigan. There is obvious voter irregularity going on there if not outright fraud. I suspect it's outright fraud.
1324333848004419584 2020-11-05 20:52:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JoeBiden Joe, you LIE so much that you don’t even remember your last lie.

1324325946703446017 2020-11-05 20:21:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Can we verify this?  I love it especially after the rather obvious 200,000 dump increasing Biden’s number while Trump’s didn’t move at all.
1324325012732600325 2020-11-05 20:17:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Amazing that it was after this that Biden’s numbers suddenly goes up 200,000 while Trump’s remain static (exactly unchanged).  That isn’t statistically logical!
1324320520259719169 2020-11-05 19:59:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> What REALLY STANDS OUT is that Joe goes up by 200,000 while Trump goes up -0-!!! That is statistically UNBELIEVABLE. Calls for detailed examination of ALL Michigan ballots; ALL unless it’s possible to isolate those last 200,000.
1324078594193264648 2020-11-05 03:58:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I understand, my neck has been giving me pain as well. Doc says she thinks it's a pinched nerve in my upper spine. Fortunately, my pain is at a lower level.
1323968281754144769 2020-11-04 20:40:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Why did Democrat states stop counting when Trump was ahead in those states? Specifically Pennsylvania &amp; Georgia? Story is they are counting “mail-in/absentee” votes - COULD IT BE HARVESTING/SCREENING FOR BIDEN VOTES? It doesn’t pass the smell test.
1323617609221287936 2020-11-03 21:26:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @realDonaldTrump  I suggest that Trump request Archbishop Carlo Vigano be his spiritual advisor. Since by Canon law clergy is not allowed to be DIRECTLY involved in politics, Vigano CAN be Trump’s SPIRITUAL ADVISOR. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!

Its the leftist radicals who have been burning buildings, looting and otherwise behaving in an uncivil manner including killing a Trump supporter. Just the facts, ma’am.
1323454714139332608 2020-11-03 10:39:27 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JoannaMMeyer @OxfordDiplomat So just how is the electoral college system flawed? What system would you propose that would not allow highly populated areas to take control of the entire nation? We are a country of varied interests by geographical area. NY interests differ from Wyoming’s etc.
1323438658591084544 2020-11-03 09:35:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Agree fully.
1323437657918234625 2020-11-03 09:31:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> You only hear the left report about Covid in the most negative way. Of the total deaths involving CV-19, only 6% were CAUSED solely by CV-19. All the others had various co-morbidities. It’s all about HOW you present the facts. Your survival rate is correct!
1323254648824844296 2020-11-02 21:24:27 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 2. Don’t let Democrats lead you down that primrose path to communism. Whether you believe it or not, that is their ultimate goal - total control of you and your life.

Most restaurants here in Texas are open at least @ 3/4 capacity while many have adapted w/plastic panels allowing full occupancy &amp; they ARE FULL.
1323250117785358337 2020-11-02 21:06:27 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Amen; I’m spite of what internet news &amp; their national news echoes say.
1323249784904450048 2020-11-02 21:05:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gailsline We won our INDEPENDENCE once before (1936) and we’ll do so again if necessary. REMEMBER THE ALAMO - battle cry of the Texians at San Jacinto when Sam Houston took a rag-tag group of frontiersmen and routed a “superior” Mexican army.
1323245376925741058 2020-11-02 20:47:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Thanks for clarifying &amp; pointing out it was the white car that FIRST tried to squeeze that pickup out of position. Unfortunately the internet news report conveniently left out those DETAILS.
1323237110325874688 2020-11-02 20:14:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Not that unusual; I’m 77 so remember Hildago county in Texas when many dead Mexican Americans rose from the dead to vote for LBJ.
1323236149826125825 2020-11-02 20:10:57 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This sounds EXACTLY what the Biden-Harris ticket (and Democrat Platform) preaches/espouses.
1323117238078025728 2020-11-02 12:18:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gailsline Actually, that was the first report. They only surrounded the bus between San Antonio and Austin. Austin is our capital and unfortunately liberal - the surrounding area is not though.

They are CONFUSED; 1A says gov’t CAN’T IMPOSE any religious belief. It doesn’t prevent us fm basing our political belief on religion.

Im surprised that my posting didn’t get blocked. Sic Tucker Carlson after them; he’s getting to be a real bulldog - tenacious.

1322311967554547714 2020-10-31 06:58:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Trump is a doer; he does while Biden thinks about it without doing anything but flap his lips.

1322230448605548544 2020-10-31 01:34:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @NHBullmoose @boatingdoc_ While all religious leaders refrain from endorsing candidates, ALL RELIGIOUS LEADERS HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO GOD TO INFORM THEIR FLOCKS OF THE SINS INHERENT IN TODAYS DEMOCRAT PLATFORM OF WHICH PROMOTING ABORTION IS NUMBER ONE.  Read Carefully the 1st Amendment.
1322228250798661633 2020-10-31 01:25:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @kathywhiting1 @NHBullmoose You must be talking about those CAGES BUILT BY YOUR “ANOINTED ONE,” OBAMA IN 2014, a full 2 1/2+ years b4 Trump took office in Jan. 2017. Trump actually ended that practice not long after taking office. FUNNY HOW THE MSM IGNORED IT UNDER OBAMA.
1321995745415831558 2020-10-30 10:02:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> These nuns exemplify what a REAL CATHOLIC IS. People like Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and Andrew Cuomo are CINO's -Catholic In Name Only or in other words fake Catholics or Catholic for POLITICAL PURPOSES.
1321990295135916035 2020-10-30 09:40:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> But Democrats said there isn't any evidence of fraud! Then what is this?

1321877816837890050 2020-10-30 02:13:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The ABORTION INDUSTRY - specifically PLANNED PARENTHOOD would have you believe that a newly conceived baby is nothing but a GLOB OF TISSUE to dehumanize it. The TRUTH is that it is the BEGINNING OF A NEW HUMAN LIFE.
1321877815848062976 2020-10-30 02:13:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This article attempts to "Soft Pedal" the abortion issue. THE FACT REMAINS - THE CATHOLIC POSITION IS AGAINST ABORTION AT ANY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT!  False abortion memes are spreading among religious Latinos. It's no accident, experts say.  https://t.co/gdeIda2mEX via @YahooNews

1321785793166385154 2020-10-29 20:07:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @WPatriot2 Thanks, I was not aware of this.
1321784966909468672 2020-10-29 20:04:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 2. Wallace, Montgomery, Brazile &amp; Williams reflect STRONG BIAS in favor of Biden w/o strong substantiating facts. Carlson, Hannity &amp;  Ingraham STATE their bias BUT STILL bring in the opposing views with their guests. The 1st don’t need to because it’s so BRAZEN in their “shows.”
1321784962186727424 2020-10-29 20:04:27 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 1. Fox News needs to review 4 of their newscasters/interviewers. I understand that Fox wants to be seen as Fair/Balanced but that doesn’t mean DISMISSING significant information in the interest of supporting Joe Biden. These 4 pretend to be fair but clearly are not.
1321639774915014657 2020-10-29 10:27:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That is the absolute truth. Hard to believe all the energy he has/shows.
1321622416896962561 2020-10-29 09:18:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It’s really a sad reflection of human values FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY VOTE FOR CORRUPT JOE BIDEN. They act like blind sheep being led to the slaughter.
1321617985912688640 2020-10-29 09:00:56 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> In contrast, watching Tucker Carlson interview Tony Bobulinski, he came across as very professional and asked good questions without ACCUSING Tony. Consequently the viewer was informed and ALLOWED TO FORM HIS OWN OPINION. I can only conclude that Lisa had an agenda.

1321571828230488067 2020-10-29 05:57:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The Obama administration benefited by PURE LUCK that swine flu wasn’t particularly deadly. Trump has done everything reasonably possible to contain the virus and minimize the effects. It’s a matter of record.
1321570573407948805 2020-10-29 05:52:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Just the facts.
1321561914858737664 2020-10-29 05:18:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @steveno88 @NitaDry Well, we do have to go through the legal process. I do understand your frustrations - I feel the same way.
1321561683773558785 2020-10-29 05:17:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 I would say that the "fracking issue" more than anything else has exposed Biden AND Harris for the liars they are. The evidence of it is absolutely clean and clear.
1321557933755371521 2020-10-29 05:02:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Last year, my wife and I did apply for and get the vote by mail ballots (for those over 65) but got concerned that our vote wouldn't be counted so didn't use them. When we went to the voting place to vote in person, we had to sign affidavits stating that we had not used them.
1321557248779390977 2020-10-29 04:59:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 I know of several whom I know to be basically conservative but may vote for Biden because they don't see Trump as compassionate. For me it's like rejecting the best doctor available because you don't like his "bedside" manner. Give me the best doctor and no BS.
1321556249188720640 2020-10-29 04:55:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 I have found using Microsoft Edge to be a pretty good search engine. I don't like their very slanted/biased news postings however.
1321555829254955009 2020-10-29 04:53:57 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I loved Ted Cruz's comment to Jack Dorsey - "Who the hell gave you the right to censor." (my paraphrased summary)
1321555408624955395 2020-10-29 04:52:17 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Just posted the others.

Can I change my vote? — Quartz -  https://t.co/mL0Q0QIO3J  https://t.co/0piyLRxZRu 1 day ago · The states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Alaska, and some counties in Connecticut, explicitly allow voters to change their absentee ballot choice after the vote has been cast.
1321554979417690117 2020-10-29 04:50:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 I only saw Wisconsin listed in the article.
1321554750073176067 2020-10-29 04:49:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Great job summarizing WHAT ALL  Trump has done/accomplished in those short 46 months. Now for others out there to get up-to-date and educate themselves BEFORE voting.
1321553943932080136 2020-10-29 04:46:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I checked and it's "officially" allowed in 7 states. It also stated that you can change your vote up to 3 times in Wisconsin.  I never needed that as I have stayed abreast of the issues and the policy proposals so it's been a very easy choice for me and my wife.
1321553371845853194 2020-10-29 04:44:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Well said!
1321539049467924480 2020-10-29 03:47:17 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @drunkpepe_afc @Bishopoftyler You just described what will happen if Biden is elected. His roll back of Trump tax cuts, re-instating repressive Obama regs and EXPANDED ABORTION (UNBORN BABY KILLINGS) will destroy our rebounding nation.
1321538203418005504 2020-10-29 03:43:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> God bless you Your Excellency AND God Bless America. Now to get Trump - re-elected.
1321447766468472833 2020-10-28 21:44:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> WHERE IS THE TRANSPARENCY IN THE MSM? They talk a big battle but when the war is at hand, they hide everything/anything that might expose the Bidens for what they are. THEY HAVE NO INTEGRITY! No Transparency - No integrity.
1321447262380269568 2020-10-28 21:42:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> There has been a CONCERTED EFFORT  by Mass Media to undermine anything and everything related to President Trump and his admin. The most recent is the refusal of MSM to thoroughly investigate the Hunter Biden laptop emails and corroborating texts and emails from T. Bobulinski.
1321446480364867584 2020-10-28 21:39:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> BUT Fauci and company still are in denial even though many doctors are using the regimen of HC, Zinc and Azithromycin or Doxycycline. Check out Frontline Doctors for more information.
1321444141855870985 2020-10-28 21:30:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @1MadKatt1 Yes, they call it "PLAUSIBLE DENIAL." Fancy wording for big fat lies. Remember how Clinton was known as "Slick Willie?" We need a similar name for Old Joe. Maybe Lyin' Biden.
1321443140012789760 2020-10-28 21:26:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I believe the answer is that too many people in HIGH PLACES are afraid of being exposed for what they are if/when Trump is re-elected. That WOULD EXPLAIN why so many WEALTHY ELITISTS donated to the Biden campaign. A BIDEN PRESIDENCY WOULD CRIPPLE OUR ECONOMY IRREPARABLY.
1321442330247835651 2020-10-28 21:22:57 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> News media (even in Fox News interview) now trying to discredit Rudy Giuliani re. the Hunter Biden laptop IN SPITE OF COROBORRATING EVIDENCE FURNISHED BY TONY BOBULINSKI. Refer to Tuesday, Oct. 27 interview of Bobulinski by Tucker Carlson. The QUESTION is why BIG cover the up?
1321414632570048514 2020-10-28 19:32:53 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> PHILADELPHIA RIOTS PURELY EXCUSE TO DESTROY/LOOT.

POLICE ACTED CORRECTLY.
1321271560594927616 2020-10-28 10:04:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> BEIJING BIDEN - name change for old Joe. Hey, it fits!
1321269559312207874 2020-10-28 09:56:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gene_sury We could call them the Clinton-Biden crime families. Very much like the Mafia of the 1920’s,30’s &amp; 40’s. Is Old Joe The Godfather there?
1321265921927819271 2020-10-28 09:41:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Great, very informative interview. Don’t hold your breath on those other news outlets.
1321264983783690248 2020-10-28 09:38:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Joe wins the prize for Biggest Liar and most corrupt person ever.

1321227130672418819 2020-10-28 07:07:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Claiming to be Catholic doesn’t make you a Catholic anymore than saying you are a donkey. Come to think of it, it does make  you that other name for a donkey (jackass).
1321226484778995715 2020-10-28 07:05:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Joe double talks so much that even his professed religious belief comes into question. He will say and USE anything AND ANYBODY to get elected. He only seeks power.
1321225208095670274 2020-10-28 07:00:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This priests speaks clearly - no obfuscation here.   https://t.co/5rtDPBUh3n
1321144929389813760 2020-10-28 01:41:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Trump also promoted peace agreements between Israel and UAE, Bahrain &amp; Sudan. Wife and I both voted for Trump - initially w/reservations, but have been happy that we did and voted for him again this time around.

1321060098983239680 2020-10-27 20:04:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @realDonaldTrump -VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO CONSIDER &amp; POINT OUT.
1321059621889626114 2020-10-27 20:02:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Biden/MSM refuses to acknowledge these facts.
1321059339386408962 2020-10-27 20:01:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> ABSOLUTELY - No question about it.
1321058446075187200 2020-10-27 19:57:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> MANUFACTURING ON FIRE IN TEXAS (Fox News) This reflects  REPUBLICAN POLICIES IN TEXAS. Remember, the oil/gas industry got slammed during early CV-19 issues &amp; lockdowns. TEXAS’ BOOMING MANUFACTURING IN SPITE OF CORONAVIRUS. You’re welcome here but leave your BLUE Politics behind!
1321057154011418626 2020-10-27 19:52:24 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> MORE BIDEN LIES! If you Really want to know when Biden lied, ALL YOU NEED FO IS LOOK BACK AT WHAT HE SAID DURING THE PRIMARIES - it’s all there on various video clips of those primaries and post primary interviews.
1321055648797331456 2020-10-27 19:46:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> CHRISTIANS (all persuasions) TAKE NOTE: 1. Abortion IS killing a BABY -FACT! 2. ENVIRONMENTALISM - an UNPROVEN “science.” ZERO PREDICTIONS came true over past 50 YEARS!!! 3. ECONOMY - raising taxes, re-instating Obama regs.,killing oil/gas industry. WILL DESTROY ECONOMY.
1320915690371637249 2020-10-27 10:30:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> After watching Senator Hirono make a fool of herself, I’d be voting for Trump too. I would also be looking for the earliest opportunity to replace Hirono.
1320914057327710210 2020-10-27 10:23:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> In time, Senator Collins will come to regret her decision not to vote for Amy Barrett. It made me decide NOT to send any money to her campaign.
1320913067727880194 2020-10-27 10:19:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> God bless this action by our Senate.

1320902482147614727 2020-10-27 09:37:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @livelovethinkex I recall talking to old farmer relatives from the 1940-1950’s; they would tell you that you can expect a period of roughly 7 years of rainy weather followed be roughly the same period of dry/drought years. Not scientific but experience based.
1320803926174801925 2020-10-27 03:06:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @livelovethinkex @Electroversenet Climate change is real BUT IT’S CYCLICAL (sometimes temporarily as in the case of a major volcanic eruption) for a variety of reasons. Climate change proponents don’t like to look at ALL THE INFLUENCERS. that doesn’t fit their narrative of man’s activity being 1st &amp; foremost.
1320554188741447681 2020-10-26 10:33:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex this was intended for your information. Abortion is the pre-eminent issue of our time far exceeding environment in our time.
1320553632580993026 2020-10-26 10:31:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Perhaps you should speak more on the horrors of Abortion.
1320553423339769856 2020-10-26 10:30:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex FYI - you may want to learn more about environmental “scientists” making judgements/predictions.

1320536699131334656 2020-10-26 09:24:18 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Bricklebear1 Be sure to open and read the article. It was interesting to me that although I input: “environmental predictions since 1970,” I only got a bomber of listings similar to the pic I posted.
1320531814272933898 2020-10-26 09:04:53 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Democrats list ENVIRONMENT as one of their most important issues, yet “0” predictions have come true over past 50 YEARS!!!

1320521044143329281 2020-10-26 08:22:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Oops!  Most not mist but I suppose most could describe Biden’s brain today - kind of misty/foggy.
1320487917207388161 2020-10-26 06:10:27 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> IF BIDEN CAN’T GET OUT AND CAMPAIGN, how will he be able to run the country?
1320487579544965122 2020-10-26 06:09:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Very sad what a few in “leadership” positions did to disgrace the organization. It’s that group that hurt the FBI reputation and NOT President Trump; he simply exposed.

1320321816355872769 2020-10-25 19:10:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Joe makes his “latest” home town wherever it’s to his perceived political advantage. Joe says whatever he thinks  his present audience wants to hear. He says one thing one time and something opposite on another. DUPLICITY!!!
1320189347505766402 2020-10-25 10:24:03 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Obama definitely mist corrupt.
1320077679350190081 2020-10-25 03:00:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @tbgstephen @SArchibald Good job, Stephen. I added another fact supporting yours.
1320074018213474304 2020-10-25 02:45:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That is just one issue Trump was referring to in the debate when he said the "Cure must not be worse than the pandemic." People need to better educate themselves to the real facts. Just because Fauci is consider an "expert" by some doesn't mean he is GOD; he isn't INFALLIBLE.
1320073287846797314 2020-10-25 02:42:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Bricklebear1 Todays "climate change" activists need to better educate themselves to the real facts. Most have never heard of the Milankovich cycle (available on Google) or understand the impacts or solar flares or volcanic eruptions on our atmosphere versus man-made impacts.
1320072776376602624 2020-10-25 02:40:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I was in the Engr. &amp; Constr. bus. for 50+ years where we designed/built these plants for various oil/gas corps. As far back as 1968, (before EPA) we were designing ways to minimize/eliminate pollutants from getting into the atmosphere. Trump is correct about our clean atmos.
1320062373017931780 2020-10-25 01:59:29 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @BryanDeanWright @dodiewill2 And now there is corroborating evidence from Tony Bobulinski. The fire grows hotter- someone is going to get burned.
1320061096133275655 2020-10-25 01:54:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Trump in North Carina shows video clip of Biden stating he would reduce social security. The clip was of Bernie Sanders challenging Biden as he tries to deny it. Video flashes back to Biden’s earlier statements. What a liar Joe Biden is!!!
1320059567439532033 2020-10-25 01:48:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> You are so right. It doesn’t matter if you’re Black, White or Purple, Protestant, Muslim, Jew or Catholic, if you support AND love America, you have to recognize those facts.
1320058132278747136 2020-10-25 01:42:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 4. RE-IMPOSE Obama era stifling small businesses.  These are just a few of the items proposed but alone or together kill many jobs and make most things we use daily unaffordable. These are very basic economic impacts w/o even getting into the details. THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS
1320058128231268353 2020-10-25 01:42:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> VOTERS BEWARE!!! 1, Proposed Democrat policies that would contribute to destruction of the economy: 1. End fracking- kill oil/gas industry 2. IMPOSE $15/hr min wage - kill small businesses 3. Subsidize wind/solar energy - unreliable &amp; significantly increase heating/cooling costs
1320055814804078594 2020-10-25 01:33:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gailsline That is the ESSENCE of the Democrat policy. Their MISSION STATEMENT could be: Create more programs that result in people’s DEPENDENCY ON GOVERNMENT.
1320054749597749249 2020-10-25 01:29:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Who really thinks he reported ANY UNDER TABLE money he received from Hunter or anyone else. JOE KNOWS WHERE THE GRATF IS.
1320053471371034625 2020-10-25 01:24:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Good job, but you left out Senators Schumer, Blumenthal,Coons plus.....
1320049892581138434 2020-10-25 01:09:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Important information in this short video.   https://t.co/uB4CEyOOKt
1320024692397383681 2020-10-24 23:29:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 2. Democrats talk a good battle about standing up for the most deprived in society but INSTITUTE POLICIES HURTING THEM THE MOST. Due to their lack of understanding the most basic economics or “stepping on them,” they continue down the path of destruction of our country.
1320024688911912960 2020-10-24 23:29:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 1. HYPOCRISY AND BIGOTRY DEFINED —-DEMOCRAT e.g. Killing fracking &amp; the oil &amp; gas industry will HURT THE POOREST in our society the most by drastically increasing transportation and heating/cooling costs. Finally it will impact production costs &amp; EVERYTHING WE USE DAILY.
1320011322210291714 2020-10-24 22:36:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @bricerl California is a great example of how not to run a State or for that matter over regulate an economy.
1319987420239155202 2020-10-24 21:01:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @bricerl Thank you;; that’s the basis of where I’m coming from. I pay $1.65/gal here in Texas near Houston.
1319985511356911616 2020-10-24 20:54:04 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> “EXPOSED - TRUTH”
1319985023198646272 2020-10-24 20:52:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Want $5.00/gallon gasoline?  That is what a Biden administration would bring when he KILLS THE OIL/GAS INDUSTRY.  CONSIDER the impact on your DRIVING cost AND the OVERALL TRANSPORTATION COSTS. That would IMPACT of EVERYTHING you buy wherever you buy it. THINK B4 VOTING!!!
1319736618815803396 2020-10-24 04:25:04 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SenSchumer Hey Chuck, you seem to forget how your old pal Harry Reid rammed things through the Senate and even changed the vote for appellate court judges to a simple majority to help Obama put liberal judges on those courts. You didn't seem to have any objections then. GROW UP!!!
1319735905758957571 2020-10-24 04:22:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Trump is racking up the foreign policy wins.
1319729388028645381 2020-10-24 03:56:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @atensnut @DonWeldy Sure do.
1319729262031765505 2020-10-24 03:55:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> You can always tell when Biden is lying. His mouth is open and he begins to speak.
1319713042079338497 2020-10-24 02:51:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Breaking out what many see as her special interests would allow the bill to be passed quickly. She could then try to SELL her remaining desires on their own merit. DON’T LOAD WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY W/things that are questionable/controversial.
1319713039831257091 2020-10-24 02:51:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Pelosi is the OBSTACLE to passing a straightforward bill to help: Unemployed Small businesses Assistance to schools  These 3 are clearly Covid related.  Pelosi can float a SEPARATE BILL to assist those states that have financial problems not directly covid related.
1319710060415680514 2020-10-24 02:39:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> True and kind of obvious to those paying attention. Maybe Biden needs to be investigated for hiding income funneled to him thru Hunter.
1319709440334008320 2020-10-24 02:37:04 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SteelhorseQ Not sure which one came first but Hunter IS A PRODUCT OF HIS ENVIRONMENT (home life or lack thereof). Maybe Joe should have spent less time “politicking” and more attention to his personal life. Don’t know but sure could be.
1319708264548925444 2020-10-24 02:32:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This has not gone unnoticed. Congress will be taking action on the actions by these companies. THEY CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO CENSOR ANY POLITICAL COMMENTS. They are not investigator, judge and jury!
1319707296621072384 2020-10-24 02:28:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> President Trump is building great partnerships especially w/Mid-East countries. He has also gotten our NATO allies to commit to paying their fair share of NATO expenses. That is something they were not doing.
1319681866207735810 2020-10-24 00:47:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Why isn’t this information ever in the MASS MEDIA NEWS. We have to find out by our own digging.
1319678473544368128 2020-10-24 00:34:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Crime eventually catches up with criminals one way or another.
1319673521002455042 2020-10-24 00:14:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Very good description of the Joe Biden we all know. He CAN NOT BE TRUSTED.
1319670867337596930 2020-10-24 00:03:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This is something every college student (and their leftist professors) should read.

1319668900934651911 2020-10-23 23:55:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Yup spelled it out well.
1319668536353148928 2020-10-23 23:54:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @IWasntHere4 @pwjuarez I had forgotten about that one but I do remember what a pain Harry Reid was when he was Senate Majority Leader. Democrats forget that and don’t like it when the shoe is on the other foot.
1319614564888158209 2020-10-23 20:20:04 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> And this morning Trump has posted the proof in Joe’s own words plus his running mate reinforcing it.
1319613887222775809 2020-10-23 20:17:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We’ve all seen Joe say he was against fracking and showed animus toward the oil/gas industry. We now know about his involvement w/Ukraine &amp; China. He may not have DIRECTLY rec’d funds fm China but very likely did thru his son Hunter. Joe lives w/LIES!
1319612381148909568 2020-10-23 20:11:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> WHEN DOES JOE BIDEN LIE? Whenever he opens his mouth. He lied several times in the debate last night but moderator never called him out.
1319611768025513986 2020-10-23 20:08:57 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @jtblogs @CIG_KingJames @YouTube Unfortunately, none of the MSM is covering any of this story.
1319611220878643203 2020-10-23 20:06:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Please retweet b4 voting.
1319611046194270209 2020-10-23 20:06:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Reading people’s comments regarding promoting wind/solar energy, it is apparent that they don’t understand the limitations of them. The oil/gas industry has not done an adequate job of EDUCATING people re the industry.  Comments clearly reflect a lack of understanding the facts.
1319609871944290305 2020-10-23 20:01:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @rachellerfav @energycitizens Please educate yourself about this subject -talk w/experts IN THE INDUSTRY b4 drawing conclusions.
1319609436730724352 2020-10-23 19:59:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @DaleBai2723 @energycitizens Shows total lack of understanding regarding these two methods of electricity generation. Both are unreliable for variety of reasons. Talk to an electrical engineer b4 you spout off about something you don’t really understand.
1319608739608121345 2020-10-23 19:56:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @cor3yf @energycitizens What you picture can be minimized thru proper forest management. Forest fires are not caused by “climate change” but by people doing stupid things like setting fires and sometime by lightening strikes. Proper forest management minimizes/stops the spread of fires.
1319607905663000576 2020-10-23 19:53:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Spockout1 @energycitizens That’s really an intelligent statement! Reflects total propaganda and no factual basis.
1319607602628726785 2020-10-23 19:52:24 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Definitely!
1319607523515731968 2020-10-23 19:52:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @mustangsandbox @energycitizens Kill the oil/gas industry &amp; you kill the airlines cruise industry and adversely affect the operation cost of transportation &amp; all businesses affected by that increased cost.
1319606746302828544 2020-10-23 19:49:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ChomskyisBae @funtimz1 @energycitizens Viable only if heavily subsidized by the government. The only “subsidy” the oil/gas receives is the depletion allowance which is much like any real estate investor gets thru depreciation.
1319605890106986498 2020-10-23 19:45:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @funtimz1 @energycitizens Dream on.
1319605798603980800 2020-10-23 19:45:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @blushybloo @energycitizens We already have the technology but what you fail to realize is that it is not economical w/o govt subsidies. There are distribution problems plus there are pollutants as by products of manufacture of the components. Killing the oil industry would kill 10,000,000 jobs.
1319604866013155329 2020-10-23 19:41:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @kenyoung2020 @energycitizens Yes, it’s possible but everyone seems to ignore the pollutants from mining of the lithium &amp; other “rare-earth-metals” used in high capacity batteries.  I’m not impressed when I see fields of solar panels blocking the sun or a field of huge windmills while driving across Texas.
1319603800575979521 2020-10-23 19:37:17 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JCoinen @energycitizens “Renewable” energy is unreliable due to weather chgs - no wind, overcast skies or location suitable for wind driven generators or solar panels not near population centers. If you understand anything about power distribution, that’s a big problem. Windmills &amp; solar panels r ugly.
1319602235312046091 2020-10-23 19:31:04 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @sharelan @energycitizens Your comment sounds like it was based on the unfulfilled predictions of the Jimmy Carter - Al Gore predictions. The dinosaur theory has long ago been superseded. Logic should have never allowed it to even develop as a theory. Suggest you learn more about up-to-date information.
1319601192058716160 2020-10-23 19:26:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @rockergrldz @energycitizens FYI, climate has been changing since the beginning of time. B4 making comments, I suggest you inform yourself of the following: 1. Milankovich cycle 2. Impact of solar flares 3. Volcano eruptions  4. No past predictions have happened.  Keep in mind, CC is not a settled science

1319379185274638337 2020-10-23 04:44:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @FloridaSharkman I hope these witnesses are being given adequate protection. Remember what happened to Jeffrey Epstein.
1319376186724831232 2020-10-23 04:32:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Wray still hasn’t answered why the FBI has sat on Hunter Biden’s laptop. The citizens of this country need that question answered.

1319340625775513602 2020-10-23 02:11:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Typical of Democrats to MISREPRESENT FACTS OR OUTRIGHT LIE.  Then they “crawfish” when they get caught with their pants down.
1319336990475771911 2020-10-23 01:57:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I believe you got it right.
1319326953762074624 2020-10-23 01:17:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> You have to ASK- HOW IS IT THAT SO MANY DEMOCRATS BECOME VERY RICH WHILE IN PUBLIC OFFICE. COULD IT BE JUST LIKE THE BIDENS???

1319320357078290433 2020-10-23 00:50:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> If you Nancy Pelosi were not so OBSTINATE AND HATE FILLED, you could have worked a rational package with President Trump w/o all the LARD you tried to include. The American people are not blind. THIS IS ON YOU!!! You behaved like a PETULANT CHILD.
1319319253137448962 2020-10-23 00:46:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We need more Priests, Bishops and Cardinals to speak out of ALL issues. Too many of our Catholic families do not understand what CATHOLIC TEACHING is anymore. We all need to be reminded periodically. I once left but came back w/better understanding.
1319318439908003840 2020-10-23 00:43:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Our Church is bigger than any of the recent smoke surrounding it. Thank you Your Excellency for your commentary. Our Church is centered on Jesus &amp; The Holy Eucharist and not an opinion of the Pope not given invoking Ex Cathedra.
1319314130097012736 2020-10-23 00:26:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Democrats are quick to condemn Republicans for moving forward with confirming Amy Barrett. REMEMBER WHEN THE DEMOCRAT HOUSE RAMMED THE ACA (Obamacare) thru when they controlled the House &amp; Senate under Obama’s 1st 2 years. The shoe is on Republicans foot now!!!
1319311406139887616 2020-10-23 00:15:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> At the least, the Biden’s are a very dysfunctional family. If Old Joe didn’t know what his son Hunter was doing, he was in the least negligent.
1319310071092989959 2020-10-23 00:10:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> These are the kinds of people supporting Biden. It speaks for itself.

1319256521537093640 2020-10-22 20:37:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Good comment Peggy.
1319253224000507906 2020-10-22 20:24:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @bigfoots0169 That is the attitude of someone who doesn’t care about or simply doesn’t understand the implications of voting for Biden. Many of your brothers have seen the light and are leaving the Plantation. Not my words, theirs. But you’re free to make a bad decision.

1319248180429598720 2020-10-22 20:04:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This is the big step to CONTROL THE AMERICAN POPULACE. Read the story carefully and look at the players. Remember Bill Gates established a MONOPOLY with Microsoft software. Now he wants to take TOTAL control of everyone.

1319234148859523074 2020-10-22 19:08:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @FrankAmari2 @PressSec @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You are trying to DECEIVE THE AMERICAN VOTERS. FRANKLIN GRAHAM has already spoken on this lie and CLEARLY SUPPORTS PRESIDENT TRUMP.
1319233740246233088 2020-10-22 19:06:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @FrankAmari2 @PressSec @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP You, Frank, DO NOT SPEAK FOR MOST AMERICANS. Most Americans are MATURE ENOUGH to look and see the ACTUAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS and not judge his performance on anything but results. He has faced more obstacles than any recent president. GROW UP!!!
1319232727640641539 2020-10-22 19:02:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I read the article first but twitter still gave me the question again. I seriously believe that 60 Mins interview by Leslie Stahl will be another attempt to do a hatchet job on Trump. His followers &amp; anyone else who has stayed informed will see thru these attempts.
1319090094096175106 2020-10-22 09:36:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KevinLarchmont @Scotus 64% say yes while 33% say no so what are you talking about? Confirm Amy Barrett now!!!
1319089661294366723 2020-10-22 09:34:17 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Looks like it’s 2 to 1 in favor of confirming Amy Barrett.  What’s with the comments saying otherwise?
1319083439451181057 2020-10-22 09:09:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I’m more concerned about the Chinese - CCP.
1319082092903489537 2020-10-22 09:04:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Joe Biden also lies when he said he was endorsed by the Boilermakers Union. A boilermakers spokesperson was on Fox last night not only denying it but stating that the Boilermakers endorsed President Trump.
1319079499791826945 2020-10-22 08:53:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That laptop and emails are Hunter Biden’s. This is not disinformation.
1319072599843000322 2020-10-22 08:26:29 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Do we have a smoke screen going on to deflect attention   from the Hunter Biden laptop and associated emails? Interesting timing on F-B-I news release on Iran &amp; Russia attempting to interfere in our current election
1318967456417878022 2020-10-22 01:28:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Pelosi doesn’t want to help ordinary working Americans and the businesses that EMPLOY THEM. She ONLY wants to send GRAFT to her SPECIAL INTEREST groups.  SHE &amp; Schumer are HOLDING UP MUCH NEEDED AID.
1318963291226517508 2020-10-22 01:12:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Politics as usual.
1318951383312289792 2020-10-22 00:24:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @kippkipperme REAL WOMEN who are capable of thinking for themselves and not simply voting on “personality” support Trump. The others supporting Biden are radical feminists, socialists and the uninformed or vote simply because they “like the guy.”
1318948200955478016 2020-10-22 00:12:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> How long can we allow MSM to look the other way regarding the criminal activities and unethical Biden behavior? We must demand open reporting.
1318714064407826432 2020-10-21 08:41:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Why did Joe Biden LIE about boiler makers endorsement? Joe told GS that they endorsed him but the BOILER MAKERS SPOKESMAN SAID ON FOX NEWS TODAY THEY ENDORSED TRUMP.

He couldn’t hold a candle in a debate with the highly intelligent AND educated Amy Barrett. He either didn’t watch the grilling by Democrats that she withstood with class.

1318234455602040835 2020-10-20 00:56:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Biden can't just keep saying he doesn't know anything about Hunter's "escapades." There is too much information/evidence to the contrary. There is far more evidence here now than there ever was of any conspiracy by Trump.
1318233211089149952 2020-10-20 00:51:03 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SpeakerPelosi If you really cared about anyone/anything but lining your own purse, you would drop all the extras you have in the bill and make it a bill to help the working people and businesses that employ these people. We don't need your pet projects or bail-outs of mismanaged states.

They either don't know what it is to be Catholic or they are cafeteria christians. (lower case intentional!) They want the "benefits" of belonging w/o following.

1317851468716773378 2020-10-18 23:34:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Attended a wedding yesterday in a small town about 100 miles southwest of Houston and NO MASKS WERE REQUIRED IN THAT COUNTY. A few people including the priest at the Mass wore masks &amp; that’s fine - their choice. Few cases reported in that county. About 300 attendees there.

1317848154847518722 2020-10-18 23:20:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Pelosi doesn’t like it when she is challenged on a REAL ISSUE. For once I thought Wolf Blitzer was spot on. Nancy literally went ballistic on Wolf.
1317795366817980417 2020-10-18 19:51:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @judie14454344 Everything Biden proposed like re-enacting the full Obamacare including forcing orgs like “Little Sisters of The Poor,” penalties for not buying insurance, kill fracking &amp; highly restrict oil/gas drilling &amp; subsidies for Green New Deal will destroy the economy.
1317789716998225920 2020-10-18 19:28:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Now let’s see a congressional investigation and it has to be no-partisan like the way Pelosi did the impeachment. No, really Republicans don’t take to lynchings like the Democrats have tried doing to Trump for 4 years.
1317672299911413762 2020-10-18 11:42:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @cathyob1 @realDonaldTrump Tell me how great a job Whitmer did here. A U.S. city is facing a public health crisis, after years of denying that it had a problem with lead in its drinking water supply. In 2016, that city was Flint, Michigan.
1317668938302488577 2020-10-18 11:28:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @cathyob1 @realDonaldTrump I never referred to race so apparently it’s you who are racist by injecting it into the discussion. My opinion it based on an objective observer of their draconian (Whitmer) or radical (Omar)actions. Just facts I could care less about race or gender of either.
1317667481721462784 2020-10-18 11:23:03 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @jackedmayhem @realDonaldTrump Sorry but have it backwards; it’s the Biden’s who are more like both Chinese AND Russian assets. There has been too much evidence not to at least do a THOROUGH INVESTIGATION of the Biden activities in Ukraine and China. Did you just get off the turnip truck?
1317666661772689409 2020-10-18 11:19:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @cathyob1 @realDonaldTrump Do you REALLY look up to Whitmer and Omar? If you do, I suggest you go see a psychiatrist.
1317665991757910016 2020-10-18 11:17:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MeidasTouch @realDonaldTrump LMAO!!! Obama-Biden gave us the flattest recovery on record for 8 years. Trump had the economy running like a fine tuned engine until it was SABOTAGED by Covid. AND in spite of Covid the economy is already recovering nicely as businesses reopen after the lockdowns.
1317663980786245632 2020-10-18 11:09:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @thetoyman1 My wife and I voted for Trump and all the Republicans in the other races on Thursday. Lines were too long on Wednesday in our county just west of Houston (Harris Cty) at our regulator polling place. I’m 77 w/back issues and my wife is 70. If we can vote in person, anyone can.

1317447304727638020 2020-10-17 20:48:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Why is Washington Post lying to cover for the Biden’s? There is simply too much evidence implicating then to not have a thorough independent investigation.
1317436886378565632 2020-10-17 20:06:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It’s very obvious even in news stories like Huffpost on AOL that these social media support Democrats. That’s a conflict of interest.

1317170184860405763 2020-10-17 02:26:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We never hear that the overall recovery rate is around 99%. The way Covid cases/deaths is being reported to the public DISTORTS the truth about this serious pandemic. We need real truth in reporting.
1317169365582860289 2020-10-17 02:23:43 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @CDCgov   NEEDED: a clean and clear report that shows the number of deaths (not a % of total INVOLVING Covid) CAUSED solely by Covid-19. Table 3 says 6% but Mass Media never states that. ALL THE OTHER 94% COULD have been caused by one of their other co- morbidities. IMPORTANT!!’
1317157504976097281 2020-10-17 01:36:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 2. CDC estimates that influenza has resulted in between 9 million – 45 million illnesses, between 140,000 – 810,000 hospitalizations and between 12,000 – 61,000 deaths annually since 2010.” (Note that these are included in CV-19 deaths being reported. My comment)
1317157500454604800 2020-10-17 01:36:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> PUTTING COVID INTO PERSPECTIVE - many of the Covid deaths INCLUDE flu deaths which would have occurred regardless.   1. “Disease Burden of Influenza - CDC While the impact of flu varies, it places a substantial burden on the health of people in the United States each year.
1317153497909964804 2020-10-17 01:20:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @DanF86980147 @Rparkerscience I was talking about Biden never being questioned by GS on the ABC town hall last night. Ukraine was never mentioned and there is a lot of smoke there.
1317148449440206848 2020-10-17 01:00:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The one who was nasty &amp; very rude was Savannah Guthrie   She was very obviously pursuing an agent and trying to trip up Trump. He was actually very nice to Savannah considering all of her badgering.
1317147626777858049 2020-10-17 00:57:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 We do have certain issues that are a priority but review ALL the pertinent issues such as the abortion/economy etc. I’m amazed at how many people have little/no understanding about what affects our economy. If they understood, there is no way they could justify voting for Biden.
1317139677057552385 2020-10-17 00:25:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @alpstwt @acadianbelle Good point; she acted more like a plant and didn’t even “pretend” to be neutral.
1317139210659418113 2020-10-17 00:23:53 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 I fully understand generalizing.
1317139098176491520 2020-10-17 00:23:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 My wife has told me that she won’t even vote for women. She’s pointed out those who ran as conservative who went left once elected. I totally agree with you about those on the left. Why do so many women seem to vote on the basis of liking/not liking a person instead of  issues.
1317137580840898561 2020-10-17 00:17:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @freedomisnojoke @bobsnee AGREED!!!
1317137349252448257 2020-10-17 00:16:29 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Nor have I and I’m more than twice your age.
1317136972536811521 2020-10-17 00:15:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MarkMetts3 LOL, you have to ask? Ha, ha, ha
1317136666440749056 2020-10-17 00:13:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> If anything, Trump showed some frustration with being asked the same questions he’s on record as already answering. Only the left could see it any other way. Guthrie behaved like an attack dog - not impressive and no class.
1317133963333406720 2020-10-17 00:03:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Bishopoftyler May God bless you abundantly Your Excellency. So many of today’s Catholics are ignorant of TRUE CATHOLIC teaching. Non-Catholics are even more so but who can blame them; they don’t want to understand. Those who have truly researched frequently convert.
1317133169267789827 2020-10-16 23:59:53 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @rowing_bee @Bishopoftyler Your reply/comments reflect Thea you are totally ignorant of Catholic teaching in the catechism. The catechism I know teaches faith , hope , charity and above all LOVE. Your comments reflect none of these.
1317130530098450438 2020-10-16 23:49:24 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 There is an obvious anti Jew/Christian bias and it’s even coming from those who preach tolerance. Very hypocritical!
1317128044428099584 2020-10-16 23:39:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Madison133Patti @thetoyman1 I also doubt she was as well  which says she was making a Biden pitch knowing he had answered that question many times.
1317127563664384002 2020-10-16 23:37:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Guthrie even looks like the attack dog she behaved like. Terrible performance.
1317127215314849792 2020-10-16 23:36:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Guthrie’s “performance” makes you ask how she could have been a news anchor since 2012.  Overly and unnecessarily aggressive and contentious.
1317126459681636354 2020-10-16 23:33:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That is truly religious persecution. It’s even worse in California where the Catholic Church  is not permitted to have singing in church.
1317125087422795777 2020-10-16 23:27:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Biden gets a FULL PASS on Ukraine email scandal while President Trump gets BADGERED over renouncing white supremacists &amp; David Duke. Trump is on record renouncing these groups/individuals repeatedly. Obviously Guthrie was either totally ignorant or trying to make it an issue.
1317115271979696132 2020-10-16 22:48:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It sure looks like the Biden’s are up to their posteriors in this Ukraine &amp; China mess. Where there’s smoke, there’s fire and we can almost see the smoldering.

1317079476036112384 2020-10-16 20:26:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @tedthorne @yojudenz Compare her aggressive and classless manner to the poised and extremely intelligent, classy and poised Amy Coney Barrett. No comparison; Guthrie doesn’t even belong in the same sentence.
1317078849075675136 2020-10-16 20:24:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I agree fully.
1317078450633662465 2020-10-16 20:22:27 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That’s why so many are seeing very long lines at the polling places around the country.
1317076893301178368 2020-10-16 20:16:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We who have time will ensure you get the “ notoriety” you should. Wisdom is always welcome.

1317071869976170496 2020-10-16 19:56:18 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I thought this was supposed to be a town hall meeting. Instead it turned out to be primarily a GRILLING of Trump by Guthrie. Even the few questions from the gallery appeared to be scripted and given to PRESELECTED people to ask.
1317068971250692096 2020-10-16 19:44:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @BeccaCalifornia Absolutely!

1316917456536018945 2020-10-16 09:42:43 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @fxlozano Gotta love it!  Too bad there wasn’t a good judge on the scene.
1316917113639096321 2020-10-16 09:41:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gailsline I flipped briefly but saw what you described so watched NBC   mostly.
1316915732245000195 2020-10-16 09:35:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @thetoyman1 @realDonaldTrump Which time was Joe lying? He either lied when he said he would roll back the Trump tax cuts or he lied when he said he wouldn’t raise taxes for anyone making less than $400,000. WHY WASN’T HE ASKED THAT QUESTION?

1316912492996710402 2020-10-16 09:23:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @goteamkirk Thanks; I would add “badgering the witness” with her line of questioning.
1316912272694968321 2020-10-16 09:22:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @match_scratch @kippkipperme Thanks for the feedback.
1316912100518879233 2020-10-16 09:21:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @jenscloset @thetoyman1 She approached this “show” in a very condescending accusatory manner rather than straightforward questions asking Trump to clarify his position.
1316909638852530178 2020-10-16 09:11:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Savannah Guthrie functioned more like some interrogator in a communist questions while George Stephanopoulos gave Biden softball questions. Example is the ? to Trump about renouncing White supremacists. He is on record renouncing them as well as David Duke as far back as 2016.
1316906474535292929 2020-10-16 08:59:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Savannah did not appear to be seeking answers. Her manner of questioning was more like a prosecuting attorney in a courtroom. This whole charade is like a set-up and conductive in a very negative manner. She showed extreme bias playing the role of prosecutor.
1316906470953439232 2020-10-16 08:59:04 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Savannah is not conducting herself in a professional manner. She constantly interrupts and appears to be on an agenda. She is clearly on the attack attempting to put the president on the defensive. She is behaving as an “ATTACK DOG.” Not impressed.
1316826371528761345 2020-10-16 03:40:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SheldonRothMD1 Trump without a doubt.
1316822245906493442 2020-10-16 03:24:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> And that is from the mouth/pen of a Psychiatrist.
1316790335008276484 2020-10-16 01:17:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Tedcruz   Thought you would like to see this.
1316789829804470273 2020-10-16 01:15:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @WPatriot2 Now I remember her and tend to agree.
1316788720868225030 2020-10-16 01:11:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Vital news release.   https://t.co/KusFy5iz3Z
1316788303358758915 2020-10-16 01:09:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> MSM needs to follow up on this story ASAP before this election.   https://t.co/IijqyOdSl7
1316778527191109633 2020-10-16 00:30:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> What evidence does she have other than her word?
1316777462005731329 2020-10-16 00:26:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That would result in Sharia law.
1316777273706545157 2020-10-16 00:25:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It’s way past time that the MSM do their jobs and investigate and bring to the fore ALL the issues related to the Biden’s. It’s pretty obvious they are not clean.
1316776390306549765 2020-10-16 00:22:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It is clear that social media is using their platforms to restrict free speech. They promote a far left wing agenda and obstruct free flow of center-right information.
1316774832491696128 2020-10-16 00:15:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Those are my sentiments as well. When we voted to elect President Trump in 2016, we elected him for 4 years, not 31/2. Further in 2028, we voted in a Republican majority in the Senate. The American people HAVE SPOKEN.
1316714917945368578 2020-10-15 20:17:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Make this go viral!
1316713499964432384 2020-10-15 20:12:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That may be a gross understatement.
1316713325800181760 2020-10-15 20:11:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That story should be a headline alongside the Hunter Biden laptop/email story from the NY POST.
1316711330716549120 2020-10-15 20:03:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> A vote for Biden is a vote for criminalizing the presidency and for socialism/communism.
1316710645711204352 2020-10-15 20:00:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> People in the trenches know and understand what Trump has done for Americans.

1316707684205420544 2020-10-15 19:49:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @icebergz99 Disgusting display; absolutely no class or sense of propriety.
1316707498045378560 2020-10-15 19:48:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Hirono has absolutely no class. Those “sex” questions were totally unnecessary and to do so in front of Judge Barrett’s children made it worse.
1316706779703771137 2020-10-15 19:45:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 2.Again, so where is MSM getting the 210,000+ number they were reporting last week?

1316520646382321664 2020-10-15 07:25:56 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @LindaLiberty9 @gailsline CORRECTION; Trump wants to fix all the bad parts in Obamacare. That may require a COMPLETE OVERHAUL.

NO ENERGY TO HIT THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL! That’s why he’s been kept mostly hidden.
1316347396784377860 2020-10-14 19:57:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Eyeswid22663829 Compare the facts/ accomplishments and don’t be misled by MSM rhetoric. Don’t let personalities get in the way of straight thinking. FIFTY-SIX PERCENT of Americans recognize they are better off after 3 1/3 years of Trump than after 8 years under Obama.
1316346781517729792 2020-10-14 19:55:03 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> How can Democrats or for that matter BE SO BLIND not to see thru Joe Biden. Anyone paying attention can easily see how incompetent he is and making one faux pas after another. He doesn’t emend know what office he’s running for stating he’s running for Senator - on record.
1316345390137044992 2020-10-14 19:49:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Democrats have done nothing but SCARE TACTICS in their commentaries &amp; the few actual questions they have for Judge Amy Barrett. They ask repetitive questions disguising them trying to trap her. She is simply TOO INTELLIGENT to fall for Democrats game. When Amy wins, America wins
1316343704072978433 2020-10-14 19:42:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SenBooker You really showed the American people just how RACIST YOU ARE. Asking Judge Barrett how she felt when she saw the policeman’s knee on GF’s neck knowing she has 2 black children was enough. Then you added does she condemn white supremacy. That’s RACIST!
1316335190411804672 2020-10-14 19:09:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @thetoyman1 Senators Cruz and Crapo destroyed those Democrat senators when he showed data reflecting that Democrats got 3/4 of all the so called dark money. I only wish that they had been able to state who those contributes are. (Not were but ARE)
1316208934676561921 2020-10-14 10:47:18 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Sinai18890266 Thank you.
1316166526249074689 2020-10-14 07:58:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @amyklobuchar the people DID choose when we elected Trump in 2016 and a Republican Senate in 2018 so Amy Coney Barrett IS the people’s choice. You had your 8 years under Obama; that era is over!
1316164372918607872 2020-10-14 07:50:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Sinai18890266 What is worse than outright lies is the HALF-TRUTHS they pass on. Half-truths are half believable so people get taken in.
1316162857734737921 2020-10-14 07:44:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Brilliant woman; very impressive and unruffled.
1316120859325726720 2020-10-14 04:57:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Democrat senators are using the Barrett confirmation hearing as a soap box for political posturing on the ACA (Obamacare). They are trying to get Barrett to commit on how she would rule on hypothetical case.
1316069245432856577 2020-10-14 01:32:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The polls admittedly tend to be heavy on the Democrat side.
1316068899994165255 2020-10-14 01:30:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 That’s the only part I heard. I think she will be a strict constitutionalist. That’s why Democrats don’t like her. They want a fluid constitution.
1315988866642382849 2020-10-13 20:12:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 We shopped at Sam’s last week &amp; my wife forgot her mask in the suv but no one challenged her although she was the only one w/o a mask.
1315986290131771394 2020-10-13 20:02:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 I only wear a mask when entering an establishment requiring it to enter. Otherwise, I don’t wear one.
1315972606290427904 2020-10-13 19:08:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Just real life facts.
1315849596200013830 2020-10-13 10:59:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We out in flyover country and anyone else watching her antics would vote no, not fit for office.

1315831333457997829 2020-10-13 09:46:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Take note black America; this is who supports the Democrat party. They don’t care about you; they only care about maintaining power.

1315822437641195521 2020-10-13 09:11:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Shnrch33 @POTUS We cannot be overconfident as that can lead to apathy on the part of our voters.
1315822105691328513 2020-10-13 09:10:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We don’t need to just win, we need a RED TSUNAMI - A LANDSLIDE.
1315811361226657792 2020-10-13 08:27:29 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Joe Biden doesn’t even seem to be cognizant that it’s president he’s running for and not the Senate. How many of you caught that faux pas today! Has he had a mental medical exam?  He needs one; he’s barely lucid.
1315808209798680576 2020-10-13 08:14:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> How can Joe Biden, spend 47 years in capital hill &amp; not know/understand our constitution?  Joe doesn’t understand that : 1. President is elected for 4 years.  2. President has responsibility to fill court vacancies.  3.  Senate approves/rejects nomination.  NOT UNCONSTITUTIONAL!
1315801563164741632 2020-10-13 07:48:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I think you just hit the nail on the head regarding those polls.
1315795066208870400 2020-10-13 07:22:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Cynthia33246529 Thank you; if there were any TRUE JOURNALISTS out there, that is what they would be doing instead of spreading fear and hatred of Trump.
1315791502635937792 2020-10-13 07:08:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Covid-29 is not a hoax but the way it’s being reported leaves much to be desired. Sweden got it right in not doing a total shutdown of their entire country. Simply take appropriate precautions as with any highly contagious disease. Trump is right; DON’T CREATE PANIC!
1315783849859780611 2020-10-13 06:38:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 4. Source for above is:  https://t.co/jynASe6wtK “Weekly Updates by Select Demographic and Geographic Characteristics.”
1315783847582281728 2020-10-13 06:38:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 3. Clearly ALL of our mass media choose to MISREPORT facts regarding CV-19 cases and deaths. One can only assume that they want to continue to instill fear into the populace. The question is WHY???
1315783845241905153 2020-10-13 06:38:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 2.  Following quote is in explanations before Table 3: “For 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death. “
1315783840783380481 2020-10-13 06:38:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 1. MEDIA @foxnews, @cnn CONTINUES MISREPORTING CORONAVIRUS caused DEATHS. CDC notes in its weekly report in Table-3 that Deaths SOLELY CAUSED BY CV-19 are 6% of the total INVOLVING CV-19 which is 198,809 as of 10/7/20.
1315776015222923265 2020-10-13 06:07:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @PressSec @JillDarrah Our prayers are with you.
1315775602910257162 2020-10-13 06:05:24 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We need more doctors with the courage to speak out. It has become obvious to anyone closely following the CV-19 cases/deaths that the data reported be MEDIA is misleading at best. At worst it may be outright lying by virtue of how data is presented.
1315761218183929859 2020-10-13 05:08:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @thetoyman1 @BarackObama Not to mention the penalty for not buying insurance. That really made sense. Fine someone that can’t afford the health ins. B4 Trump got it changed many people paid fines of $2000 or more because that was less than the cost of insurance. Our ins premiums incr’d by $250/mo.
1315725622702993411 2020-10-13 02:46:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> What has become very apparent to me in watching the Barrett hearings is that Democrats must feel that Obamacare is on very shaky legal ground. That is almost all they have talked about this morning.
1315724825269350402 2020-10-13 02:43:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Democrats are trying to use this Amy Barrett hearing as a platform to campaign for keeping Obamacare. If Obamacare is on such solid legal ground, why are Democrats so concerned?  Barrett is a fundamental law advocate and not an activist judge.
1315722370531946499 2020-10-13 02:33:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> One of my grown sons was faced with exorbitant health care costs or being penalized by the Obamacare “fine” for not having insurance after a job loss. Trump got that penalty removed from Obamacare.
1315721488822083585 2020-10-13 02:30:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Abortion is an act of violence particularly if you are the PERSON being killed.
1315718926844784641 2020-10-13 02:20:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The real reason Democrats want to prevent her nomination &amp; confirmation is in hope that Biden will win the election and they can then nominate a very liberal activist person. Despite Democrats posturing, it is a completely legitimate process.
1315718924600782849 2020-10-13 02:20:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Watching the Amy Barrett hearing this morning the ONE THING THAT STANDS OUT is Democrat commentators are NOT INTERESTED IN her qualifications but only their pet interests. It is OBVIOUS that both her qualifications &amp; character are impeccable.
1315702365559848960 2020-10-13 01:14:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Kamala Harris not talking about qualifications but about Covid and the AFC (affordable care act). W/so many Democrats talking only about the ACA, it leads me to believe that it is fundamentally flawed and not on solid legal ground.
1315700124094529538 2020-10-13 01:05:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> WHY ARE DEMOCRATS SO AFRAID OF HAVING A JUDGE WHO RULES BASED ON WHAT THE LAW SAYS?  It seems they want a judge who will act politically but politically based on their personal philosophy regardless of what the law says.
1315698746395627521 2020-10-13 01:00:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Senator Crapo (R-ID) giving a history lesson ripping up comments made this morning by various Democrats. He is presenting FACTS vs EMOTIONAL STATEMENTS by Democrats.
1315696461066182657 2020-10-13 00:50:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SenBooker Watching you at the hearing today, you speak of planning. If a woman “plans” her sexual encounter, she doesn’t have to get pregnant. What you propose is in essence using abortion as a form of birth control. That is irresponsible behavior.
1315692319765659650 2020-10-13 00:34:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It seems they are only making arguments for the ACA and their fear that abortion might be challenged.
1315691810220650497 2020-10-13 00:32:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Very good comment.
1315691438911389696 2020-10-13 00:30:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Ken_J_Aber @gailsline Good point. Typical Democrat narrative. Religion is always a problem when it doesn’t fit. That narrative.
1315682095046500352 2020-10-12 23:53:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Trump had a constitutional duty to nominate a replacement for Judge Ginsberg. Not doing so would violate the constitution. The Senate can chose to confirm or reject. Democrats are trying to politicize this.
1315679873894096899 2020-10-12 23:45:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Democrats must feel that the Affordable Care Act must be on very shaky legal ground based on their opening comments at the Amy Barrett hearings. They have only made emotion based comments and nothing in the way of legal issues.
1315677407936905216 2020-10-12 23:35:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Di Blasio is doing to Jews what Newsome is doing to Catholics in San Francisco &amp; The rest of California. Both are in violation of our constitution by virtue of interfering with people’s right to practice their religion.
1315672781271465985 2020-10-12 23:16:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gailsline There has been a clear bigoted attack against not only the Catholic Church and ANYONE associated with it. We are seeing it today with Chris Coons comments at the Amy Barrett confirmation hearings.
1315670091464351745 2020-10-12 23:06:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Senator Sasse gave a great opening statement defining the 3 separate gov’t.  offices &amp; responsibilities. Senator Coon gave his response which was entirely a political commentary.
1315624724505001984 2020-10-12 20:05:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That’s because we have been much better off. If not for Covid, we would be seeing record low unemployment.
1315623927461355521 2020-10-12 20:02:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Those are examples of Biden-Harris supporters.
1315623504126115840 2020-10-12 20:01:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Could they be grasping for straws?  WHAT KINDS OF PEOPLE COULD SUPPORT/VOTE FOR THE BIDEN-HARRIS TICKET? I can only assume they don’t love their country or are Blind &amp; Deaf.
1315620349141188608 2020-10-12 19:48:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Help if you can.
1315620137945399296 2020-10-12 19:47:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Don’t disclose our silent majority.
1315422233062498304 2020-10-12 06:41:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @edcbm @DrEstella @KeithOlbermann @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Never heard of him before. To me he’s a nobody spouting off.
1315421123811700737 2020-10-12 06:36:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @stillgray @IDFWUMF That’s ludicrous! No more need be said.
1315392666289541127 2020-10-12 04:43:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We cannot allow this group to lull us into thinking they have our best interests at heart. It is the laying of a foundation for a ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT.
1315391802615238657 2020-10-12 04:40:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JustinToney13 @michaeljohns @TeaPartyHub A vote for Biden-Harris is a vote for socialism/communism.
1315391573228695552 2020-10-12 04:39:24 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Biden’s proposed tax hikes alone would tank the economy and reinstating Obama era regulations would further destroy it. Many people will suffer.
1315388649253593089 2020-10-12 04:27:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @TimJackowski Joe Biden does not want voters to know his true position on anything.
1315388323632951296 2020-10-12 04:26:29 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @TimJackowski Keep in mind for example in the case of Roe vs Wade, the court did not rule on a law enacted by congress but ENACTED/CREATED a law not in our constitution. There is no right to abortion in the constitution. Think about that; it’s a stretch at best.
1315357399755223040 2020-10-12 02:23:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @digwarrior4kids @FloridaSharkman The Catholic Church is bigger than Jo Biden, Nancy Pelosi or the present Pope. The gates of hell shall not prevail against it no matter how many times it is attacked. It has been under attack for roughly 2000 years and still exists today.

1315351202226470912 2020-10-12 01:58:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex And the Lords example was to put to death those murderous vinedressers.
1315350835996569600 2020-10-12 01:57:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex How about ALL Christians and people of good will being called to END ABORTION? Please be as concrete on abortion as you are on the death penalty. Babies in the womb committed no crime; murderers who receive the death penalty did commit a crime. Think about that!
1315350171094482946 2020-10-12 01:54:53 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 3. Further, note that no socialist/communist nations are listed amongst the upper rankings of GIVING. Greed has many forms and it is not exclusively a capitalist trait.
1315350168687071232 2020-10-12 01:54:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 2.  America, New Zealand and Canada top ... - The Independent | US  https://t.co/WwfnOQdUne... Charitable giving by individuals as a percentage of GDP in America was recorded at 1.44%, in New Zealand at 0.79%, in Canada at.77% and in the UK – which came fourth globally – at 0.54%.
1315350163506987008 2020-10-12 01:54:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 1. @Pontifex With respect to your continued bashing of Capitalism, note the following: 1. Indonesia 2. Australia 3. New Zealand 4. United States 5. Ireland Note that all 5 of these countries lead in the order listed in charitable giving and all are Capitalist nations.
1315347316040232966 2020-10-12 01:43:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex I do believe in Prayer but prayer without action is like James said in the Bible about faith. "Demonstrate your faith to me without works, and I will demonstrate my faith to you from my works." Faith (prayer alone) without works is dead. PRAY AND DO!!!
1315345333690474498 2020-10-12 01:35:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex I must also add that the Lord gave us intelligence to know how to manage forest areas in such a way as to minimize forest fires. They cannot be totally eliminated but CAN be minimized through proper scientific forest management. Cut major fire lanes and remove deadwood to start.
1315344763927830531 2020-10-12 01:33:24 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex In no way do I intend disrespect for the office of the Pope who is the "Vicar of Christ" on earth. I believe firmly in the Church's teaching. However, I also feel compelled to call out any Priest, Bishop and/or our Pope on issues which are more political than religious.

1315319620811841538 2020-10-11 23:53:29 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We need straight answers from Biden and Harris and no more double talk. They either don't give an answer of answer the opposite of what they are on RECORD saying.
1315306582285017091 2020-10-11 23:01:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @jaketapper In 2009, we had 60,000,000 million cases of swine flu. Fortunately it was less lethal. You,Jake Tapper, are instilling fear by your reporting. WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS that 99+% of all who get CV-19 recover. STOP THE PANIC MONGERING! Report the FULL TRUTH, NOT SELECTIVE.

1315259010367524864 2020-10-11 19:52:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Monday is Columbus Day. Don’t be misled by those history revisionists who misrepresent what Columbus did for their own interests. The TRUTH is available but some elements of our our society choose to distort it.
1315258282345476096 2020-10-11 19:49:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> CAPITALISM GIVES PEOPLE HOPE. SOCIALISM DRAGS EVERYONE DOWN AND DESTROYS INDIVIDUAL  INCENTIVE. With socialism, government takes from those who produce/create &amp; GIVE it to those who won’t put forth the effort to produce/create.
1315257140869836807 2020-10-11 19:45:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Joe Biden states openly in front of cameras that VOTERS DON’T NEED TO KNOW WHERE HE STANDS. I guess he prefers to continue spreading lies or refusing to answer tough questions. I KNOW WHERE TRUMP STANDS ON ALL ISSUES - he’s got my vote.
1315255667616145409 2020-10-11 19:39:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @marfin58 @Kenny_Sowellfan @realDonaldTrump @FloridaChiefs The media has sensationalized reporting by using that 200,000+ number. Our media lives to instill fear into the populace. Be careful what you believe or buy into.
1315255072230641664 2020-10-11 19:37:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @marfin58 @Kenny_Sowellfan @realDonaldTrump @FloridaChiefs I suggest that you take a deep look into the CDC reports. In Table 3 of their weekly report, only 6% (about 12,000) of those deaths are caused only from Covid-19. ALL others had various co-morbidities that either caused or contributed to their deaths. Just the FACTS.
1315245741758087168 2020-10-11 18:59:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @DrEstella @KeithOlbermann @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Olberman comes off sounding like a total sicko or idiot. He absolutely doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
1315104804419637248 2020-10-11 09:39:53 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Oct. 7, 2020 CDC report, table 1 lists 198,809 (all deaths INVOLVING Covid-19).  Table 3 introduction states 6% of those  list ONLY COVID-19. That equates to 11,929 deaths SPECIFICALLY caused by Covid-19; ALL others had CO-MORBIDITIES. LET’S see some HONEST MEDIA REPORTING.
1315045023696785412 2020-10-11 05:42:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex Beautiful dream but there are people in our world who for whatever reason choose to antagonize others and a good example is the action of abortionists. Perhaps you can reason with those who take innocent lives to the tune of over 60,000,000 in the US alone since 1973.
1315043824192966656 2020-10-11 05:37:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex If one's son or daughter commits murder, you still love that person but recognize that that person deserves appropriate punishment. The same is true if a son or daughter does homosexual behavior. You love your offspring but don't approve of their actions any more than murder.
1315043180488937472 2020-10-11 05:35:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex So does this mean that you are approving of homosexual activities - actions including homosexual unions and even deranged abortionists? Just wanting to hear you really clarify your positions on this.
1315042724266082308 2020-10-11 05:33:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex Those in prisons in most cases are there because they deprived someone of their freedom in some form or fashion. How would you propose to treat those who murdered others in cold blood?
1315038232195805186 2020-10-11 05:15:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @drdavidsamadi @johnpecco1 Old Joe is easily confused.

1315036196100337668 2020-10-11 05:07:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @CattHarmony @TBeansprout Biden doesn't want voters to know the truth.

1315035232647684096 2020-10-11 05:03:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @McKaylaRoseJ Great and accurate observation.
1315032664894779392 2020-10-11 04:53:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> And this is the man the Democrats have picked to lead their party. Will Democrats really act like ZOMBIES or SHEEP and follow this liar and vote for him? SAD!
1315032149981044740 2020-10-11 04:51:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @DebHaslam @andy_legault That is pure racism!!!
1315031838738571265 2020-10-11 04:49:57 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> By now, everyone should recognize Joe Biden's true colors and lies.

1315030436549197825 2020-10-11 04:44:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> So who is in collusion with the Russians/Putin? Looks awful cozy to me especially knowing the connection of the $3.5 million given to Hunter Biden.
1315002866076180481 2020-10-11 02:54:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @AngelWarrior321 @partytime1776 That's what happens when you lose perspective of what your business and product is all about. NOBODY WANTS TO PAY TO SEE A BUNCH OF OVERPAID ATHLETES DISRESPECT OUR COUNTRY - ESPECIALLY ANYONE WHO SERVED IN THE MILITARY.

1314987811209183232 2020-10-11 01:55:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 2. Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi fail on at least two of the three listed. I'll let you decide which they are. I can't comment on their loyalty or lack thereof to their families.
1314987810290630659 2020-10-11 01:54:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 1. If we can't trust people like Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi to be faithful to their PROFESSED RELIGIOUS BELIEF and thereby to GOD, how can we possibly trust them to act in the best interests of our country. REMEMBER THE PRIORITIES; GOD FIRST, FAMILY NEXT AND THEN COUNTRY.
1314982425848578050 2020-10-11 01:33:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @haveaconcern @DoriMuetz If true, that’s heresy, Pure and simple.
1314981741464088580 2020-10-11 01:30:53 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 3. Individual effort is disincentivized under socialism whereas under capitalism that effort is rewarded giving workers an incentive to strive to do their best. Capitalism allows &amp; encourages people to rise above their present condition/situation.
1314981738859368450 2020-10-11 01:30:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 2.  Under Socialism, the government owns/controls the means of production and tends to heavily restrict freedoms of both business &amp; individuals. With Capitalism private business/investors become the means of production with minimal regulation. Regs for = playing field only.
1314981734048559104 2020-10-11 01:30:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 1. @Pontifex Apparently some religious leaders don’t truly understand basic capitalism vs socialism. They seem to see greed only in capitalism but fail to see/acknowledge greed in socialism. GREED EXISTS IN ALL ECONOMIC SYSTEMS.
1314976631648391169 2020-10-11 01:10:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi denigrate Catholicism by their very public actions

1314909118856081409 2020-10-10 20:42:18 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> FOR THE RECORD! President Trump has condemned ALL radical groups on BOTH the left AND right. He was specific so when Biden/Harris say he hasn’t, THEY ARE OUTRIGHT LYING.  Biden/Harris refuse to condemn ANTIFA &amp; the BLM ORGANIZATION or stacking the Supreme Court.

1314755452899557376 2020-10-10 10:31:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ETheFriendly @JSEIFERT10 Very good summary. I have been posting part of table 1 focusing on those 24 and under - school/college age students in making the argument for opening up our schools. Unfortunately the MSM has been pushing the numbers INVOLVING vs due to Covid-19.
1314707068985765889 2020-10-10 07:19:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 I agree with this choice wholeheartedly.
1314659924404776960 2020-10-10 04:12:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Twitter seems awfully quiet today.
1314622743346925568 2020-10-10 01:44:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 This is just more Nancy muddying up the water with her delusional thinking. What actually needs to happen is to remove her from office for incompetency. She obviously is operating with a few loose screws.
1314542010381021185 2020-10-09 20:23:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SenTedCruz @bekind4america Biden is on record stating he would end fracking. Calling attention to that as Hannity dod by replaying the video clip is telling the truth.
1314541444946956290 2020-10-09 20:21:18 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @DonaldJTrumpJr @hrenee80 How about getting some more neutral to moderate the next debate if there is such a thing.
1314541095297130497 2020-10-09 20:19:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gbril9 I believe it is a poll of CNN, MSNBC etc listeners/watchers. Those listeners don’t take the effort to look beneath what they are being presented.
1314540189683978241 2020-10-09 20:16:18 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @martingeddes @Bebebird5 The trick is in how you ensure neutral factual news. Perhaps some means of holding news reporters to a much higher standard. It has to have some teeth. Very hard to eliminate bias in reporting.
1314538167706550272 2020-10-09 20:08:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex That does not mean looking away from those supporting atrocities like abortion and homosexual BEHAVIOR. Both of which go against basic Catholic teaching. SIN MUST BE CALLED OUT - love the sinner but hate the sin.
1314537294410416134 2020-10-09 20:04:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JackPosobiec @Herhealthynews So much for Putin supporting Trump. Putin can see that Biden is now a closet socialist.

1314533754380201984 2020-10-09 19:50:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Eyeswid22663829 These are FACTS and should put things into proper perspective. We don’t need all the hysteria.
1314532457690136576 2020-10-09 19:45:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MrAndyNgo And now you know the rest of the story.
1314522107066408960 2020-10-09 19:04:27 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @rsultzba Typical obstructionism. That seems to be the only thing the Democrats want to do.

1314381408148893698 2020-10-09 09:45:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JoeBiden Joe, you need to go do your homework. Trump is in record as condemning the few “white supremacist” groups plus David Dukes. You get an “F” here. Stop LYING!!!

1314301188498763776 2020-10-09 04:26:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 I doubt that many on capitol hill understand what fracking really is. They don't realize that fracking has been going on since at least the 1050s. It's 3D seismic imaging and horizontal/directional drilling that is more recent and even that's been with us for some time.
1314188506391085058 2020-10-08 20:58:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @mspdcali @AngelWarrior321 So very true. Unless you start flipping channels (Fox, OANN Newsmax, you will only get indoctrinated by MSM.

1314176549881552896 2020-10-08 20:11:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @mpukita Rather elementary.

1314168895960502272 2020-10-08 19:40:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Pence definitely the winner of last night’s debate. Kamala’s squirming and facial expressions reflected how uncomfortable she was. Review of video clips from previous (primary) debates and interviews showed her lying about fracking &amp; Green New Deal.

1313906019316228096 2020-10-08 02:16:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ValSantosOnAir @Bishopoftyler No one forced “that woman” to choose to have sex and allow herself to get pregnant. What you’re really saying is you want a society with free sex and no consequences. Be responsible!!!
1313904955519107073 2020-10-08 02:12:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pappa_dan @Bishopoftyler There is a whole treatise on that subject. I believe it is called “Humana Vitae.” It’s based on the belief that we are ALL God’s creation and to interfere with that process is inherently wrong. It isn’t about “logic” but about TRUE faith in God.

1313815476775116801 2020-10-07 20:16:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump No, Pelosi tried to add a lot of special unrelated items into the bill. Trump &amp; the Senate proposed a bill helping workers &amp; small businesses w/o any FLUFF and Pelosi wouldn’t even consider it. Please look at the facts &amp; WHOLE picture.
1313814730365075456 2020-10-07 20:13:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Responsible Americans don’t want to see bailouts of MISMANAGED Democrat OR Republican states. If your state has a management problem like New York &amp; California, VOTE IM SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO MANAGE YOUR STATE. WE DID IN TEXAS which was once Democrat.
1313813805474996224 2020-10-07 20:09:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump Look at the junk Pelosi wants to put into any aid package. KEEP IT CLEAN AND LEAN - help for working Americans AND small businesses who EMPLOY THEM. THINK!!!
1313813264573313024 2020-10-07 20:07:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Kenny_Sowellfan @realDonaldTrump Black Supremacy doesn’t want to lift EVERYONE but only CERTAIN blacks. Therefore THAT is a truly RACIST perspective. It must be acknowledged.
1313812794446426112 2020-10-07 20:05:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @real_defender @realDonaldTrump So true!
1313812729657004033 2020-10-07 20:05:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I suppose that’s why the really big money -Soros, Bloomberg, Gates , Buffet etc spend so much supporting the Democratic Party. TAKE YOUR BLINDERS OFF BOTH YOUR EYES AND YOUR BRAIN (if you even have one.)
1313812065178525697 2020-10-07 20:03:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Kenny_Sowellfan @realDonaldTrump Thomas Sowell - he is always so perceptive in his observations.
1313811302377295873 2020-10-07 19:59:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @realDonaldTrump Pelosi &amp; company are more interested in HER SPECIAL INTERESTS than American working people or small business owners. She &amp; other Democrats get PAID by ELITIST BILLIONAIRES - just look who are Democrat supporters, SOROS, BLOOMBERG, GATES and you can add your own list.
1313804756008173569 2020-10-07 19:33:57 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Terrenc43516485 @yoakumgirl923 And no shots were even fired; they were only trying to protect their home from potential intruders.
1313804399664410626 2020-10-07 19:32:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @swamp_nugget @CIG_KingJames That is how communists operate. Voting for Biden could very well result in similar actions here. Just look back at the Obama years and all the unnecessary regulations implemented.
1313803783378526209 2020-10-07 19:30:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @tryingtobecivil @johannaramm @RepLeeZeldin Very well said my friend. Totally logical AND PERCEPTIVE comment.
1313803325016551425 2020-10-07 19:28:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @johannaramm @RepLeeZeldin Totally illogical!  My wife (70 years old) and I (77) VOTED IN PERSON in the primaries during the peak of this crisis and more than adequate precautions were in place. There was little or no risk to us or others to vote IN PERSON. Mail-in voting isn’t necessary.
1313632720942256128 2020-10-07 08:10:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dawalf Biden &amp; Pelosi are CINO’s - Catholic In Name Only.

1313502518295621633 2020-10-06 23:32:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @mike_hamm @toddstarnes What I see from the chart is that even tho the US has had almost 3x the number of cases as the closest, our death rate per 100k is less than all but 4 of the three countries on the list, all w/ far lower total populations.
1313500693303615490 2020-10-06 23:25:43 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @toddstarnes Chris is entitled to his OPINION but he should not present himself as an unbiased moderator when he is a REGISTERED DEMOCRAT WITH PRETTY OBVIOUS BIAS.

1313250555993694209 2020-10-06 06:51:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @catholicthing  Robert Royal does a nice job in todays "The Catholic Thing" article "Breathing Fire" regarding the Pope's recent encyclical "Fratelli Tutti."  One wonders exactly what the Pope's intention is as he once again writes in a confusing manner.
1313246528270733322 2020-10-06 06:35:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @kippkipperme Could there be something going on here that we're all missing? It does seem odd.
1313241148400586753 2020-10-06 06:14:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> It seems that every day, we read about another problem with these mail-in ballots. Yet, Democrats keep saying there isn't any issue with voter fraud.
1313238603275866112 2020-10-06 06:04:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> May God bless you and your family Abundantly. He selects those worthy of His graces and I know that He favors the Pro-Religious Freedom and Pro-life stance the President had shown. We are all sinners but GOD forgives those who repent.
1313231506173820929 2020-10-06 05:36:04 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @kippkipperme What is it about anti-gun people that prevents them from understanding that it's deranged people who kill and not the gun. The gun is an inanimate object incapable of doing anything without a user; it's the user not the object that's at fault.

1313219089343688705 2020-10-06 04:46:43 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex Instilling the desire to share what one has worked hard for with others is noble. Instilling the desire to learn and educate oneself is better. Give a man a fish, you feed him a meal; teach a man to fish and you feed him (and his family) for life.
1313218482360770563 2020-10-06 04:44:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex Injustice can also be taking from those who put forth effort to create and giving it or part of it to those who do not put forth efforts. That is the problem with socialism - idealistic but demoralizing and destroys incentive to work and put forth effort.
1313217719752429568 2020-10-06 04:41:17 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex The primary degraders of the environment today are China and India. Others in that sector of the world also need to show much improvement. Additional restrictions in the US would yield only incremental reduction and at exceptionally high cost and likely do more harm than good.
1313215839638880263 2020-10-06 04:33:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex I know that your HEART is in the right place but your words make us seriously wonder about your political leanings. They appear to be seriously communistic. Please explain so that we can better understand the basis for your writings/commentaries.
1313215135587106822 2020-10-06 04:31:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex One cannot begin to help others until he has taken care of himself and his family. Please look at statistics of which countries and individuals in which countries contribute most in the way of charitable help to less fortunate.
1313214693373349888 2020-10-06 04:29:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex NOTE THAT IT WAS THE INDIVIDUAL AND NOT A POLITICAL SYSTEM AT PLAY HERE. It's what is in the heart of the individual regardless of the economic system; Capitalism allows one to rise above his background; socialism keeps everyone down as a subsistence level or lower.
1313214066652053505 2020-10-06 04:26:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> You would do better to stick to purely religious philosophy. We should take care of those less fortunate than we but that should never be imposed on us by our governments or a political system. That would be tyranny. Are you in favor of communism? Greed is there in all systems.
1313214065615933441 2020-10-06 04:26:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex - It seems that you have been indoctrinated by the socialists/communists/globalists regarding economic systems and the environment. There is too much evidence contrary to what you espouse on those subjects. Please look at the evidence that is contrary to propaganda.
1313093896575037442 2020-10-05 20:29:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @FriendlyJMC @InfidelAngela I stood at the Berlin Wall in 1961 and saw first hand what East Berlin was like - STARK AND DARK!
1313091460212850689 2020-10-05 20:19:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex Capitalism has done more to lift people from poverty than any other economic system. I am a personal example of how capitalism allowed me to rise from poverty through my efforts. Abuses exist in ALL economic systems but socialism pulls all down.
1313090629879115782 2020-10-05 20:16:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex Note also that the US has done far more to advance environmental improvement than other nations. You bash Capitalism but say nothing of all the human suffering in China (communism) India, Iran &amp; so many who KEEP their people in poverty.
1313089436033392644 2020-10-05 20:11:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex Thank you, your Excellency because you noted it was the Samaritan that helped. It was not the Priest or Levite. It is what is in the heart of the individual and not the system. Note that the US (Capitalist country) gives far more in foreign aid than any other nation on earth.
1312908573668671488 2020-10-05 08:12:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @AnaJuliaG8 @realDonaldTrump That Biden-20 would be the worst virus in history.

1312536515830931456 2020-10-04 07:34:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @EpochTimes @PrideNews1 This reflects the respect from foreign leaders that OUR President Trump has. Unfortunately many Democrats are too hate filled to put aside their differences and show similar compassion.
1312388103567441929 2020-10-03 21:44:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @wrestlerkw7 Very good observation and description of the left. You only left out self interested (conceited).
1312387448681443328 2020-10-03 21:42:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @wrestlerkw7 @esq_mom And the problem with lying is that you have to tell another bigger lie to try to cover the first one.
1312386372754432000 2020-10-03 21:37:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @seanhannity If it wasn't for Ilhan Omar, AOC and the other 2 of the four, Pelosi would rank as the MOST VILE WOMAN ON EARTH. She is so HATE FILLED THAT SHE has no compassion for anything other than what furthers her PERSONAL DESIRES. She &amp; Democrats could CARE LESS about our country.
1312385524028641280 2020-10-03 21:34:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @IlhanMN Yes Ilhan, YOU REALLY need to get it together. You are the most UNGRATEFUL person I've ever heard of. You continuously SPIT IN THE FACE of the country of the very people who gave you and other Somalians REFUGE during your time of crisis. That is UNGRATEFUL/SPITEFUL!
1312384763513241601 2020-10-03 21:31:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Jennyjen010 I've been watching Newsmax as well. I usually watch Fox and Friends each morning and Tucker, Hannity and Laura Ingraham but flip over to 349 (DirecTV) depending on what's being reported/discussed.
1312128109827616768 2020-10-03 04:31:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 She is also on record as stating in 2016 when Obama was in his lame duck year that the president serves for 4 years and not 3 1/2.
1312124877294333952 2020-10-03 04:18:43 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 @JoeBiden My sentiments as well, our country has been too divided for far too long. We need more compassion and less hatred.

1312123140479221760 2020-10-03 04:11:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 @dbongino My prayers as well are with you and your family.
1312107318008446976 2020-10-03 03:08:57 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Far more TRUTH in that statement than we would like to admit. An astute observation
1312105959838248960 2020-10-03 03:03:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex On this we agree.
1312105852149526529 2020-10-03 03:03:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex Common as in the purely “Catholic/Christian” is one thing but as a political system of governance, it equates to communism. Is the Catholic Church now pushing communism?  That isn’t the Catholic Church I know and love.
1312105207749197824 2020-10-03 03:00:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex That sounds a lot like Marxism/communism. That system has been a failure everywhere and instead of helping people rise from poverty, it impoverishes the masses. Only the Elitist “politburo bureau” do well in that system at everyone else’s expense
1312098808667336705 2020-10-03 02:35:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @BeSmartnMatter And THIS IS THE PERSON who could become president if Biden is elected. IT’S DOUBTFUL that Biden will last more than 6 months to a year.

1312066895089205255 2020-10-03 00:28:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @chic_savage My reference to Elitists wan in how THEY think of themselves. I agree with you that we don't see them that way.
1312065839299006464 2020-10-03 00:24:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @LiberatedCit @gailsline Most definitely; they spend so much time obsessing over and attacking Trump that they don't take time to really look at and question (with substantiating information) Biden. They simply let him off the hook when he claims something is a lie all the while lying himself.

1312062074646867969 2020-10-03 00:09:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @derekmaltz_sr All the more reason why we need to re-elect Trump.
1312061697381851138 2020-10-03 00:07:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Actually what Trump did was reiterate what he had said previously more than once.

You are right calling it BS.
1312053347646607361 2020-10-02 23:34:29 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Most liberals don't even have the decency to do what Tulsi Gabbard did in her tweet this morning wishing the best to President Trump and Melania. She didn't pass any of the typical leftist BS. Some were downright hateful which isn't surprising given their demeanor.

I suggest you get a lot more educated about Trump's taxes than that NYT report. You just might want to study up a bit about advantages of investing in real estate.

1311688845596004352 2020-10-01 23:26:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @michaeljohns @realDonaldTrump Because Trump speaks to SPECIFIC SITUATIONS, he is sometimes misunderstood.  When a question is asked such as the "White Supremacy" thing, many of us simply do not agree with the basic premise any more than we believe in SYSTEMIC racism. Individual racism is there but that's it.

1311641782732689409 2020-10-01 20:19:04 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SharonM72464800 Yes but sometimes, we need to STATE THE OBVIOUS for those too blind to see it.
1311641542357127171 2020-10-01 20:18:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> FEMINISTS ARE HYPOCRITES; look at how quickly they jumped on accusations of Kavanaugh (unverified) but brushed accusations (verified) of Biden. VERY HYPOCRITICAL!!! What happened to “she’s a woman; you have to believe her?” No consistency in philosophy.
1311640428857483265 2020-10-01 20:13:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> ARE THERE ANY TRUE SUPPORTERS OF ALL WOMEN’S advancement? NO! Democrat women feminists show their true colors when they bash Amy Barrett in particular about her being the mother of 7 and a PRACTICING CATHOLIC. They ONLY support those who think as they do.
1311638085831139330 2020-10-01 20:04:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Breaking911 BTW, slavery is going on today in Africa and the Middle East.

Note that people of ALL RACES have enslaved others. Not saying it’s ok but it IS FACT. WHO’s going to find decedents of African chieftains that sold their own people into slavery.

Pope Francis should insist that not only Catholic Priests be INDEPENDENT of the CCP AND that ALL religions there are free to practice their belief w/o CCP PERSECUTION. NOT GOOD!!!
1311628291170807809 2020-10-01 19:25:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JmsPatriot In that case, Pope Francis should refrain from making any remarks regarding US policy on environment and immigration.
1311627383502516226 2020-10-01 19:21:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @tommcintyre1947 @JoeBiden A public figure is guilty of unethical behavior when he calls Kyle Rittenhouse a “white supremacist” while that person is or will be going on trial. It’s called prejudicing the case unfavorably.
1311506957509877761 2020-10-01 11:23:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @abigailmarone Telemundo poll was even higher at 69%+ for Trump. Read a post calling it fake and that CNN had Biden winning. Not surprising as CNN is the official Democrat mouthpiece so their followers would likely vote for Biden. They don't get to hear the TRUTH on CNN.
1311505440799252481 2020-10-01 11:17:18 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @michaeljohns @SpokespersonCHN Great set of thoughts clearly spelled out.

1311503227351822336 2020-10-01 11:08:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @BuckSexton @joebiden - Those Trump supporters were having a peaceful march but were attacked by a BLM activist. If you are honest with YOURSELF, you have to acknowledge that of all the protestors, it is the ANTIFA &amp; BLM people who are doing the bulk of the destruction - NOT PEACEFUL.
1311501680920289280 2020-10-01 11:02:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @RepGosar Exactly, so that's another lie by Joe Biden.
1311501289356836864 2020-10-01 11:00:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @TheBabylonBee Obvious bias!
1311501176752414720 2020-10-01 11:00:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Trump was right when he said that he was debating Chris Wallace as well as Biden.

FOLLOW THOSE MONEY TRAILS.
1311498259924353024 2020-10-01 10:48:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @proudtigerlsu @JoeBiden Facts came out in the recent Senate hearings about the $3.5 million that your son Hunter received from the wife of the former Mayor of Moscow. You tried to deny it but facts are substantiated and a matter of record.
1311497818402553856 2020-10-01 10:47:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JoeBiden You Joe, refused to answer that you would or would not try to pack the Supreme Court or bring back the Filibuster in the Senate. You also lied about ANTIFA or you don't know what the heck is going on. It's very clear to those of us who follow closely that ANTIFA is a threat.
1311496708644204544 2020-10-01 10:42:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @WPatriot2 That is reason enough not to trust Chris Wray. Trust nothing that Comey is associated with or supports.
1311496457590112256 2020-10-01 10:41:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @WPatriot2 @Cradcliff The only way they will admit ANTIFA is a terrorist organization is when they directly attack one of their homes or businesses and get arrested and the proof is undeniable.
1311496014633734150 2020-10-01 10:39:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @abigailmarone Telemundo poll showed 68%+ favoring Trump. Read a comment saying that their twitter poll of 10,000 respondents was bogus because CNN &amp; CBS both showed Biden winning. That isn't surprising as primarily anti-Trumpers watch those channels. CNN = Communist News Network and CBS👎

HE IS SIMPLY DOING THE JOB HE WAS ELECTED TO DO. It's up to the Senate to consider the nomination and vote to or not to confirm. Now it's their job to do just that.
1311432791297531905 2020-10-01 06:28:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @tommcintyre1947 Biden is astonishingly ignorant of the facts of what is really going on.
1311432507661918220 2020-10-01 06:27:29 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @tommcintyre1947 Biden has no credibility with respect to facts.

We choose to vote in person no matter what- it's like the old story of the postman delivering the mail come rain, snow or whatever. We have had checks lost in the mail more than a few times.
1311426851940769798 2020-10-01 06:05:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @TwitterMoments Is that why all those ballots were found in a ditch in Pennsylvania and the expose that James O'Keefe did of the voter harvesting in Minnesota? These aren't isolated instances.
1311425823296061441 2020-10-01 06:00:56 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @thetoyman1 @JoeBiden Unfortunately, the format for these debates does not present itself for challenging lies with real facts (substantiated.)
1311423811892449281 2020-10-01 05:52:56 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @thetoyman1 @JoeBiden I just wish Trump had been able to present the back-up for the things he said about and to Biden last night. We know they were true because we've been following developments and the entire Mueller investigation hoax perpetrated by Hillary Clinton (and Obama?)
1311423277039058947 2020-10-01 05:50:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @CattHarmony That's all she's got; she has no solid foundation in any kind of ethics. I doubt she even knows the meaning of the word.
1311423000693149696 2020-10-01 05:49:43 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @thetoyman1 @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump That seems to be the only way Hillary can get any kind of traction. That is until she is caught.
1311422540062101510 2020-10-01 05:47:53 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @AndrewHClark @realDonaldTrump I would be very interested at seeing the total number of responders who voted in this poll. I like it but would like to know that figure. A CSPAN poll showed trump winning with 64+% with approximately 180,000+ voting.
1311421584842907648 2020-10-01 05:44:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MelanieSpell @cspan @Bellatrixx2020 Too many people look at the personality or "good looks" of a candidate rather than actual policy proposals or performance. Know the candidates policies and what he/she stands for. Performance can be hampered by many factors such as a highly partisan congress and/or a pandemic.
1311421011091390465 2020-10-01 05:41:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @DiscoTempoJazz @cspan @DevinCow The ONLY thing regarding Black Lives that matters to Democrats is GETTING YOUR VOTE.  Just for your information, check out what Lyndon Johnson said when he was pushing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He said "I'll have those n*****s voting Democratic for 200 years."
1311280936416423939 2020-09-30 20:25:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @joepolitics4 @cspan @DevinCow How about Biden refusing to acknowledge ANTIFA as a terrorist organization or radical BLM elements. Anyone watching what is going on can see who has been destroying &amp; burning property.
1311280269601705986 2020-09-30 20:22:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @2MyQuietPlace @cspan Your allegations have been totally disproven.
1311279806663864321 2020-09-30 20:20:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Thank you for that astute observation. It is REFRESHING to see someone looking beneath personality characteristics. Trump is a bulldog while Biden is a dachshund.
1311279283915165703 2020-09-30 20:18:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @CologeroGetz @cspan That was rather obvious; it looked like Trump was debating Wallace as much as Biden.
1311279029543153664 2020-09-30 20:17:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MelanieSpell @cspan @Bellatrixx2020 Are you not capable of looking beyond personalities? I suggest you research the facts to see how much Biden lied.
1311278223221821440 2020-09-30 20:14:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @DiscoTempoJazz @cspan @DevinCow Go read the recently unclassified letter that clearly shows it was Hillary Clinton who was involved with the Russians. No Russian bots but citizens who are capable of looking beyond mannerisms.
1311277405676466176 2020-09-30 20:11:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @thechefcarolyn @cspan Since when is it disgraceful to call out your opponents clear lies. There is evidence on Trumps claims against Biden. I just wish he had cited that evidence but unfortunately the format doesn’t give either candidate to present that evidence.
1311276591587049479 2020-09-30 20:07:56 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @FSTR_2008 @cspan That is a good point. Anyone who has been closely following what has been going on and understands underlying facts could see through Biden’s lies. It isn’t unethical to take full advantage of out tax laws. I agree that the moderator should have clear facts - not allegations.
1311275614608003073 2020-09-30 20:04:03 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @WillisNonie @cspan People who answered know how much Joe Biden lies such as saying he doesn’t support The Green New Deal. Some of us are capable of looking past personalities and into underlying facts.
1311275001056817152 2020-09-30 20:01:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @starbalt @cspan It did look like it but who really knows.
1311274849374031878 2020-09-30 20:01:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @RachaelWood10 @cspan Having closely followed investigations by both John Durham and recent Senate investigations I was flabbergasted at how Biden could lie about so much and refused to answer questions.
1311274224779231234 2020-09-30 19:58:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @weneedlesslaws @cspan @realTrumpshaker Good observation. I was watching and paying particular attention to Biden’s lies. You have to be aware of all the info recently declassified to see them though.
1311273636427378688 2020-09-30 19:56:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @RachaelWood10 @cspan Hmmm, looks like you aren’t aware of the lies Old Joe told. There is documentation of the $3,500,000 his son received from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. I suggest you do some homework so that you can look beneath the surface.
1311272538195062784 2020-09-30 19:51:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @cspan Joe Biden resorted to way too much lying. Anyone following developments knows the story &amp; facts regarding Hunter. He is also on record as supporting AOC’s Green New Deal even naming her to head up environmental issues.
1310985095738687491 2020-09-30 00:49:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @proudtigerlsu Biden and Pelosi are CINO’ s. They don’t practice the faith they claim to.
1310900443783073799 2020-09-29 19:13:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @mb4hope @Poetvix @IllinoisJack85 Remember that Neville Chamberlain wanted appeasement (1938)with Germany before WWII. Germany took advantage of Britain. Churchill came in at beginning of WWII and stood strong against overwhelming odds. Hmmm, kind of like how Trump is doing today. Verifiable FACTS!!!
1310898527648784385 2020-09-29 19:05:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @WPatriot2 Remember, Obummer left over 140 judgeships unfilled. Those plus about 40 more have been now filled by Trump. All those prosecuting attorneys around the country, elected w/Soros money can only do so much. We saw the backlash over the handling of the Jesse Smollet case.
1310781150818971653 2020-09-29 11:19:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @WPatriot2 Seventh circuit ct already overturned one lower ct ruling favoring extending mail in voting deadlines. I suspect that will set precedent.
1310779901155446784 2020-09-29 11:14:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> James O’Keefe was on Fox News with more information on this story w/interviews (video) of people involved.
1310777577880072192 2020-09-29 11:05:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @michaeljohns @LookingAmerica Great/interesting podcast.
1310775448725606401 2020-09-29 10:56:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ePearce4Q @JamesMAGA70 Not quite none but it is very low.
1310771909529919489 2020-09-29 10:42:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Poetvix LOL
1310770167195017216 2020-09-29 10:35:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Poetvix I know; I was being sarcastic.
1310770015730364417 2020-09-29 10:34:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Poetvix True
1310769881147727872 2020-09-29 10:34:27 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Poetvix Also, we can’t overlook all those infected patients back to nursing homes in NY, NJ, MASS, MI and a couple of others. A huge % of the deaths occurred there.
1310769259522461696 2020-09-29 10:31:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Poetvix A good example is the hydroxychloroquine, zinc, azithromycin treatment was rejected so readily. Many who have been treated early in the illness have had less difficulty and recovered fully. Interestingly Africa, where HCQ is commonly used has had a relatively low infection rate.
1310768052296912898 2020-09-29 10:27:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Poetvix Thanks, maybe we should jus go stick our heads in the sand.

1310766126272598024 2020-09-29 10:19:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @connienotagirl @leesa_fl @pavadore_rich @trish_regan More like bought by George Soros. AOC doesn’t know hard work. She’s a radical left winger who tossed ill thought out proposals like that Green New Deal with no thought of real impact to economy. She didn’t learn a thing or was asleep if she studied economics.
1310761020990857216 2020-09-29 09:59:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @LadyLoveMAGA We need NOW!!!
1310759272406491136 2020-09-29 09:52:17 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @leesa_fl @connienotagirl @pavadore_rich @trish_regan AOC is simply an airhead. How can anyone not see through her BS. She was a bartender b4 someone saw her “acting talent.” Most of us see through her. No logic there; she must have failed/blown off those classes.
1310758672272969733 2020-09-29 09:49:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @connienotagirl @leesa_fl @pavadore_rich @trish_regan That’ll an illogical comment as you have no idea of any additional study and/or personal experience Trish Regan has. Some people are self educated in areas of personal interest.
1310757928652152832 2020-09-29 09:46:57 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @leesa_fl @connienotagirl @pavadore_rich @trish_regan Anyone who does investing particularly in real estate that you can generate positive cash flow while showing negative income due to tax laws on depreciation. You can get burned though when you sell (if there is a profit) and “recapture” comes into play. Suggest talking to a CPA.

1310750289406889990 2020-09-29 09:16:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @realMikeLindell Needs to go viral! People need to have the facts.
1310747507232845824 2020-09-29 09:05:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JamesOKeefeIII @Ilhan INVESTIGATION AND FULL REVIEW OF ALL BALLOTS REQUIRED.
1310747141640462339 2020-09-29 09:04:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @DomoLJub45 Vote for Lindsey Graham.
1310745986575273985 2020-09-29 08:59:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @rsultzba @JustthefactsAn How about addressing any “religious” question as INADMISSIBLE similar to how certain “ill obtained evidence” is not allowed in a criminal trial.
1310745332649799682 2020-09-29 08:56:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> How ridiculous!
1310745121579765761 2020-09-29 08:56:04 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @thetoyman1 @BarackObama @JoeBiden Any plan that includes penalties (removed by the courts) for those who can’t afford insurance has a lot wrong with its basic premise. Many people who lost jobs got penalized when they could no longer afford health insurance previously provided in part by their employer.
1310744238150356992 2020-09-29 08:52:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @thetoyman1 @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump IT ISN’T CRIMINAL NOR UNETHICAL TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT TAX LAWS ALLOW. IT IS STUPID not to.
1310743873015238659 2020-09-29 08:51:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @thetoyman1 @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Same here PLUS I took a special class that detailed how to generate “positive cash flow” in real estate investing while doing residential real estate during the mid-late 1980’s. It was a part of my GRI - Graduate Real Estate Institute. I was also getting my degree in business.
1310741795475787776 2020-09-29 08:42:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Only a fool would not take advantage of what the tax laws offer to reduce what you pay in taxes. This latest NY Times story about Trump is JUST ONE MORE HIT JOB attempt on Trump. It’s trying to make a mountain out of nothing - not even a mole hill.
1310740689446150144 2020-09-29 08:38:27 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @cgauthier592 @scotty_kiker Remember also that Onassis wanted to build a refinery in New England during the shortage plus other facilities. People there opposed saying they could import oil &amp; gas products via pipelines from Texas, Louisiana &amp; Oklahoma. They want the benefits w/o any risks.
1310739122034741255 2020-09-29 08:32:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @mb4hope @Poetvix @IllinoisJack85 Our motto needs to be what Winston Churchill once stated; “ NEVER, NEVER - in nothing, great or small... NEVER GIVE IN.”
1310737859402366976 2020-09-29 08:27:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Love your logic; reminds me of my course in logic called “STRAIGHT THINKING” that I took in my 40s.
1310737253648355328 2020-09-29 08:24:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Poetvix BTW, looking at the updated numbers, Covid-19 INVOLVED deaths are LESS than 10% of ALL deaths. SO WHAT ARE WE DOING TO PREVENT THOSE OTHER 90+%???  I guess we better lockdown everyone&amp; everything and throw in the towel.
1310736224043372546 2020-09-29 08:20:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Poetvix Therefore it’s up to us to analyze these reports, do any additional research &amp; present the TRUTH to those who otherwise don’t either have time or “whatever” other reason (excuse) they have to be UNINFORMED. GET INFORMED BEFORE VOTING!!! What is the data not telling us/them?
1310664526619193345 2020-09-29 03:35:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @tommcintyre1947 We must be and will be prepared.
1310645706504450050 2020-09-29 02:21:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Another note of importance is that total deaths INVOLVING COVID-19 are less than 10% of DEATHS FROM ALL CAUSES INCLUDING Covid-19. IT'S TIME TO START PUTTING THESE THINGS INTO PROPER PERSPECTIVE.
1310645184376508418 2020-09-29 02:18:57 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @kippkipperme Hey, any lawyers want to jump on this as an invasion of privacy. Just because schooling is online in many areas, doesn't mean people have to rearrange their homes to eliminate backgrounds that may contain political messages/slogans. It isn't like they are on school property.
1310643213598945282 2020-09-29 02:11:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @kippkipperme It was just a matter of time until the online teaching became online intrusion into our homes.
1310630378282135552 2020-09-29 01:20:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MccarthyNeelie @Shadow_Golem_ Thanks for the support.
1310629769524977666 2020-09-29 01:17:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @scotty_kiker That is if you are even able to find gasoline. How many of you remember the long gas lines at the pumps back in Jimmy Carter's time in office? That was around 1979; he put in place many restrictions that resulted in gasoline shortages, increased prices and an economic downturn.

1310553343069245440 2020-09-28 20:14:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @icebergz99 Because the bulk of Trump’s investments are in the real estate business, tax laws give a huge break via depreciation etc. It is all within our tax law structure.
1310552792990449668 2020-09-28 20:11:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @icebergz99 Anyone who has had real estate investments (most of Trumps) understands that due to deprecation, maintenance etc in accounting, it can result in little federal income tax due even though it produced a positive cash flow. That’s how our tax laws work.
1310549800614596609 2020-09-28 19:59:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @WPatriot2 @CharlesSawyer7 @thetoyman1 @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump Those figures were from the June report but the pattern continues thru the Sept 23 report that I posted.
1310548635239804928 2020-09-28 19:55:18 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dg_phelps @SPL4USA Hopefully; I’m afraid it may be weeks before we have a clear picture of the election results.
1310548139519225857 2020-09-28 19:53:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MccarthyNeelie @Shadow_Golem_ That’s what you only learn by digging into CDC report details &amp; spending time looking into how other countries report. Unfortunately our mass media is not interested in truth in reporting. Where is Paul Harvey when you need him??? Now you know the rest of the story.
1310547861080281088 2020-09-28 19:52:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MccarthyNeelie @Shadow_Golem_ That’s what you only learn by digging into CDC report details &amp; spending time looking into how other countries report.

1310545632751423489 2020-09-28 19:43:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Poetvix In addition to that, has anyone NOTICED that there were 1,834,467 deaths IN THE US from all other causes? That means that only (yes, I said only) 10% of ALL deaths during the same report period even INVOLVED Covid-19. Let’s put this into proper perspective.
1310398475625005057 2020-09-28 09:58:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @electapres @chuckwoolery But it’s Democrats who are insane. Republicans are the only rational ones in DC.
1310394241949093888 2020-09-28 09:41:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ewarren You’re condemning someone for using a system you helped to build. Give me a break!!! We see him as someone who is giving of himself and his wealth to help re-establish transparency in our country.
1310374725705707523 2020-09-28 08:24:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @kat2020maga Thank you! President Trump is helping blacks to make their lives matter AND BETTER.
1310325009089527809 2020-09-28 05:06:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @CharlesSawyer7 @thetoyman1 @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump Hearings are intended to inform and bring out unknown facts. It is not the purpose of “hearings” to allow personal attacks as were done in the Kavanaugh hearings. Democrats have shown their colors. That’s why I left that party years ago.
1310324084908208128 2020-09-28 05:03:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @CharlesSawyer7 @thetoyman1 @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump But hearings are not a requirement. Only a vote is. There will be hearings if the Democrats show up. They will be more like ATTACKS than hearings though.
1310322028017221634 2020-09-28 04:54:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Best political ad of this election season.

Senate has duty to confirm OR REJECT. they simply rejected Obama’s nomination by virtue of not even bringing him up for discussion. There is no DUTY to hold hearings; that’s courtesy.

1310311830028509185 2020-09-28 04:14:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Lazy48682419 @thetoyman1 The key word is INVOLVED; note it never shows Covid-19 as THE cause. Deaths nationwide specifically caused by Covid-19 alone are closer to 10,000.  The others involve various co-morbidities.
1310268294482538497 2020-09-28 01:21:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Note that Joe Biden and others are perpetuating this LIE!!!

1309919507151024136 2020-09-27 02:15:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ewarren Funny how you supported Obama when he made a nomination during his TRULY LAME DUCK YEAR. President isn't a true lame duck president as HE IS SUBJECT TO BEING RE-ELECTED ON NOVEMBER 3 FOR FOUR MORE YEARS.

1309885578230534145 2020-09-27 00:00:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @TeamCavuto When allowing Justice’s former clerk to state her “last wishes,” why didn’t you bring up her on record comment from 2016 when essentially the same situation existed? That would have made the “interview” more balanced. The public needs to know her position then.
1309875787152216065 2020-09-26 23:21:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex @UN I totally disagree with your perspective.
1309875569908224000 2020-09-26 23:20:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex @UN The mentality you abhore has little or nothing to do with guns or other armaments. It has EVERYTHING to do with a socialist view presented as positive when in fact history shows socialism results in OPPRESSION &amp; greater poverty. It fosters an attitude of what’s yours is mine.

1309090611048386563 2020-09-24 19:21:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @H1Tch7 Add mine.
1309090058608291845 2020-09-24 19:19:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This goes right along with the items I posted regarding how cases are being reported by the cdc.
1309088094172348419 2020-09-24 19:11:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @WPatriot2 @jsolomonReports That is typical of Democrats and particularly Gov. Newsom. They never think things thru before shooting from the hip. Never a well thought out targeted response.

1308925546437451776 2020-09-24 08:25:43 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Bishopoftyler I believe that this presidential election presents with a clear choice who to vote for. One candidate is pro-family and pro-life and the other is pro-homosexual marriage and pro-choice/abortion. I need not name the candidates; their positions define them.
1308921681373810691 2020-09-24 08:10:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Involved and caused are not the same thing. That 200,000 number we keep hearing today includes all the co-morbidities including flu in that number. I have found no listing in the CDC documents purely for deaths caused by flu. They are lumping those with Covid.
1308921680476151810 2020-09-24 08:10:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Can anyone truthfully tell me why the news media constantly leave out the key word "involved" when reporting the Covid-19 death count? When you look at the source CDC document in Table 1, it clearly states "Covid involved deaths" at the top of the column listing the numbers.
1308920467030327296 2020-09-24 08:05:32 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @thetoyman1 There is no inherent right to resist arrest even if you think you are not guilty. This is true regardless of race or any other factor. Policemen can not judge your intent when you resist in any way. Live to fight another way another day.
1308917303564791809 2020-09-24 07:52:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @BarbaraThayer1 I'm just exasperated at all the misinformation that most people simply accept without digging into it for the source information. What's there that they aren't telling us? We have to question everything.
1308916776454033410 2020-09-24 07:50:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @LadyLoveMAGA Electing Biden to the presidency would be akin to putting the Mafia in the office.
1308916549147910144 2020-09-24 07:49:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @derekmaltz_sr @ChadHastyRadio Not to mention all the drug recalls due to "contamination" in Chinese factories producing many of our drugs. I personally have had 2 recalled; one, valsartan, was for blood pressure and the other, metformin, for control of my type 2 diabetes.
1308915095901216768 2020-09-24 07:44:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Democrats always try to have it both ways. They love the laws when it favors them but hate them when it favors the other side.
1308914925650227205 2020-09-24 07:43:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That alone is double talk; follow the unverified dying wish but don't follow her 2016 statement when it was Obama's choice to nominate nor Dodie's comment about RBG being against packing the court. Typical Democrat double talk.
1308894452581314562 2020-09-24 06:22:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @RoseDC11 @lovescatahoulas This comment by RBG we know is true.

Apparently she doesn't know Joe and what he is proposing for the US should he become president. His proposals are a recipe for economic disaster.
1308810392169316352 2020-09-24 00:48:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @buybk @Grav1 Try taking the issues and throw any party issue out and then argue the issue solely on the merits of the issue/issues. That's where I see things falling apart in our 2 party system.
1308810080570298371 2020-09-24 00:46:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @buybk @Grav1 That's your opinion to which you're entitled. I see it the complete opposite and I was once a voting Democrat. The failure of so many cities/states in our country led by Democrats is proof of the pudding.
1308809609591783428 2020-09-24 00:45:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @buybk @Grav1 Can't argue with that. In particular, the US Supreme Court has been guilty of reading into the constitution and creating laws which is not their purview. Creating laws is the job of congress (House &amp; Senate) with approval/veto by the President.
1308808971600506881 2020-09-24 00:42:29 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Due to the tendency of newscasters giving short sound bites, they don't take time to refer watchers/listeners to dig into the resources such as  https://t.co/jynASe6wtK to find the whole truth. Baier didn't lie in reporting the 200,000 CV-19 deaths but stopped short of details.
1308808970778431488 2020-09-24 00:42:29 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We have a serious problem with ALL of our news media for someone truly seeking truth. One must sift through anything stated even on a network you generally trust. I just had to do this with a misleading report on Fox News by Bret Baier regarding Covid deaths.
1308807401869651969 2020-09-24 00:36:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @buybk @Grav1 It is made political by those who want it to be a fluid document. The Constitution was written in a way that made change to it very difficult - requires 75% of all states to buy in and not a simple or "super" majority (66%). We need to stick to what our constitution says.
1308803692230062083 2020-09-24 00:21:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @brandy1137 @Shadow_Golem_ You can find more details by going to  https://t.co/jynASe6wtK, and locate "Weekly Updates by Select Demographic and Geographic Characteristics." Locate table one and I think you'll find some of what you're looking for.
1308802800571351045 2020-09-24 00:17:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Democrat governors particularly in NY and NJ caused the death tolls there to be much higher than necessary.
1308802593129484293 2020-09-24 00:17:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SpeakerPelosi The facts are that not all of those 200,000 died because of CV-19. Go look at the details of the  https://t.co/jynASe6wtK reports especially table 1 which breaks down all the co-morbidities any of which could have been the actual cause of death. They were lumped together!
1308802046288703489 2020-09-24 00:14:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> To those fleeing NY, leave your Democrat politics behind you or you will end up electing someone just as bad in your new locale.
1308801723679600642 2020-09-24 00:13:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @buybk @Grav1 Things are said in the heat of campaigns such as Kamala Harris calling Biden a racist amongst other things but now she is his running mate; that's politics. On the issues, Cruz has been consistent regarding the constitution.
1308801306082127872 2020-09-24 00:12:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @kimmypills @vickib501 @Grav1 @tedcruz You missed my point; that isn't proof.
1308801118949048321 2020-09-24 00:11:17 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @brandy1137 @Shadow_Golem_ The reason you haven't seen them (regular flu numbers) is they have been included with the covid-19 numbers. There is a column listing flu but it is lists covid present. What we don't know is which disease those people got first. You can go to the  https://t.co/jynASe6wtK site.
1308794235215323136 2020-09-23 23:43:56 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @represhmode @greenbunny7 @Grav1 @tedcruz We have a constitution; Republicans believe in it and attempt to abide by it. Democrats trample it and want it to be a fluid document. If something is fluid, it can flow anywhere and be changed willy-nilly. That's like building a house on shifting sands - like your Fl. beach.
1308793382341410816 2020-09-23 23:40:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @represhmode @greenbunny7 @Grav1 @tedcruz When one party (Democrats - I used to be one)  descends to the depths of immorality, there is no room for compromise. Example: 1st they got the Supreme Ct to rule for Abortion and there were limits to when. Not they want to even kill the baby after it is born!

Oh and while you're at it, read Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr i. Solzhenitsyn. Maybe then you might understand better about the 1619 project.
1308789846933147648 2020-09-23 23:26:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump WOW! You really misunderstood what the president was talking about.
1308789522403123202 2020-09-23 23:25:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump You nailed it; too many people want to have it all without putting forth the effort and keeping clean. (Crime free)
1308789244236881920 2020-09-23 23:24:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Thanks for your clarification in simple English.

1308787438526046209 2020-09-23 23:16:56 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @buybk @Grav1 Perhaps Democrats; remember Ted is still an active Senator. Republicans respect him for his honesty and consistency.
1308787032009969666 2020-09-23 23:15:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @kimmypills @vickib501 @Grav1 @tedcruz The difference is that no one tried to say Scalia gave any "dying words" on what to or not to do.  What proof has even been submitted that she actually said what is alleged? Democrats have politicized everything in particular for the past 3+ years. They can't be trusted at all.
1308785773412528128 2020-09-23 23:10:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @greenbunny7 @Grav1 @tedcruz With the performance or should I say lack of performance of their legislative duties, NO DEMOCRAT can talk about looking out for the country's wellbeing. This has been the most partisan Democrat congress in history. Gingrich (Rep) worked with Bill Clinton to get things done.
1308785083587985413 2020-09-23 23:07:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KitterleCathy @Grav1 @BGHeaven @tedcruz Judge not lest you be judged. This isn't about Judge Ginsberg but a typical Democrat power play. Obama nominated a replacement for Judge Scalia when he was in his lame duck year. Trump is highly likely to be reelected.

Maybe @TuckerCarlson could do that on one of his upcoming segments. In fact, maybe he should do it for all the social media networks. Then we'd see who is behind them.

1308534273008377858 2020-09-23 06:30:56 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JonLemire @BretBaier Get it right; that number is CV-19 INVOLVED deaths. That isn’t the same as CV-19 CAUSED deaths. It is “All deaths involving COVID-19 (U07.1)(1Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD–10 code U07.1) copied fm  https://t.co/jynASe6wtK table 1.  KEY WORD - PRESUMED.
1308532702283542529 2020-09-23 06:24:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @axios @BretBaier Those are Coronavirus INVOLVED/RELATED deaths. Let’s get the wording correct. This is precisely why the public is questioning the reporting. READ the  https://t.co/jynASe6wtK details in weekly Updates by Select Demographics &amp; Geographic Characteristics - table 1.

1308530229456109568 2020-09-23 06:14:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JoeConchaTV @BretBaier That is a prime example of how to waste police effort.
1308529927168430082 2020-09-23 06:13:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> I know that you are interested in TRUTH &amp; the truth is that flu deaths &amp; co-morbidities are included in that 200,000 number. Deaths specifically CAUSED by Covid are closer to 10,000. The recovery rate of those infected is above 99%. Misleading reporting just causes needless fear.
1308529924379205632 2020-09-23 06:13:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @BretBaier - Why do you choose to present the number of Covid INVOLVED deaths simply as Covid deaths. That is misleading to the viewership. There is a huge difference if you look at the  https://t.co/ixBS5PsKyD “Weekly Updates by Select Demographic &amp; Geographic Characteristics.”

It's a fiction based on fact and we are now seeing much of what he predicted radical environmentalists would be willing to do in his book. Think ALL THE ARSONS IN THE WESTERN HALF OF US.

1308462884238831619 2020-09-23 01:47:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 3. Let's see more of PURE NEWS and less News w/opinion inserted. I'm very disappointed in Newsmax in this article. The OPINION doesn't belong within the news article but in a SEPARATE OPINION SECTION LIKE THE OP-ED section of newspapers. KEEP NEWS &amp; OPINIONS SEPARATE &amp; CLEAR.
1308462883249033217 2020-09-23 01:47:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 2. From what I see from postings on Twitter by people in foreign nations, most view Trump favorably &amp; even state that they wish they had someone like Trump leading their nations. The US is no longer seen as as a paper tiger as it was under the 8 years of the Obama administration.
1308462882204643333 2020-09-23 01:47:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 1. Today's Newsmax article about President Trump's prerecorded message to the UN while accurate regarding what he recorded, is filled with the author's OPINION regarding how Trump is perceived on the world stage. Even if not liked by some, he is respected and admired.
1308450718941163520 2020-09-23 00:58:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @oatney @Bishopoftyler @SFArchdiocese AMEN! Now if we could just get other Bishops around this nation to BE TRUE TO THEIR PROFESSED CATHOLIC FAITH. It isn't rocket science; the TENETS are very clear so that no one need be a PHD to understand.
1308450286000910338 2020-09-23 00:57:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> A handful of Bishops have spoken out about the "Deposit of Faith" and Catholics responsibility to vote accordingly. Still, there are "rogue" priests and at least one Cardinal who openly support the Democrat Party platform of killing babies in the womb and homosexual practice. SIN
1308450284771971072 2020-09-23 00:57:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Now if we could just get Dan Cardinal DiNardo to take a "gutsy" stand on issues such as Archbishop Cordileone &amp; Father Altman (Wisconsin) have done. A few priests are speaking about Abortion &amp; Homosexual practice &amp; the recent attacks toward OUR Church. Bishops support them!!

Has anyone else wondered why deaths from seasonal flu are not being SEPARATELY REPORTED BY CDC?  They are lumped together under Covid related cases. We need TRUTH IN REPORTING!

1307786632834228225 2020-09-21 05:00:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @michaeljohns Excellent comment. The GOP needs to clearly define to the general uninformed public exactly what is at stake and the ramifications of a Biden-Harris presidency. That message hasn't gotten thru to too many people who only watch MSM.
1307785558597529600 2020-09-21 04:55:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @proudtigerlsu @SenateGOP @senatemajldr No, it's called doing your job in the Senate when you are of the same party and the president is very likely to be re-elected. This is unlike when Obama was truly a "lame duck" president. One way or another, someone else was going to be the next president.
1307729000039624705 2020-09-21 01:11:04 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @proudtigerlsu @LindseyGrahamSC @senatemajldr Well I hate to tell you MRS. Pelosi but you have an empty quiver in this case. The president nominates and the SENATE confirms. All you can do is jawbone.
1307728292225613824 2020-09-21 01:08:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @nytimes This is where you can go to get indoctrinated in leftist PROPAGANDA. The old Soviet Union official newspaper was called "PRAVADA" which means truth in the Slavic languages. We all know though that in reality it was the Communist propaganda network. That's what NYT is now.
1307726678102343682 2020-09-21 01:01:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> What news media does he own BEHIND THE SCENES? Maybe that is why they don't want to discuss where all his tentacles extend; and I do mean tentacles.
1307724319049555975 2020-09-21 00:52:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Shnrch33 @dougducey @MayorNicholls Ditch the masks!
1307724232957341696 2020-09-21 00:52:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @AALIVESMATTER @DNC So true, I recall a lot of conservatives voicing disagreement with Obama era policies &amp;him but never did any stoop to the hatred &amp; violent demonstrations that we see today. When you disagree with a liberal and they begin to see they're wrong, they start name calling and cursing.
1307723030928543745 2020-09-21 00:47:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Shnrch33 @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump Many people everywhere including thinking blacks are coming to the same conclusion.
1307720744428859392 2020-09-21 00:38:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Herschel Walker &amp;many others have learned. They now see what BLM stands for so it does help if we post TRUE &amp; INFORMATIVE information. Many people watch too much MSM so never hear the other side. That's what I feel I am here for. If they get nasty/argumentative, block them.
1307698850853982209 2020-09-20 23:11:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Your comments show either a misunderstanding of the two different situations or a deliberate attempt to deceive your listeners. Precisely many of us do not watch MSNBC.
1307698106822262786 2020-09-20 23:08:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @maddow As I saw your comments this morning, I see that you don’t understand the difference between the 2016 Obama nomination (he truly was a lame duck w/inability to run again). Trump in contrast is not in a lame duck term but very likely to be elected to a second term.
1307697033176903682 2020-09-20 23:04:03 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 3. That would go a long way to restore peoples faith in our great Catholic Church. We are losing our flock because our Church has become like a ship without a rudder adrift in a sea of revisionism and away from basic Catholic belief. Stick to areas where you should be expert.
1307697032119947264 2020-09-20 23:04:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 2. Unlike Martin Luther, we choose to correct what we strongly is the wrong direction that some of our leadership has taken. I don’t need to spell out the details but you, Your Excellency, could start by cleaning out the homosexual priests in our church that have so tainted us.
1307697030723178496 2020-09-20 23:04:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 1. @Pontifex If you read my tweet, it may seem that I am fighting against authority within OUR CHURCH. That couldn’t be further from the TRUTH. I seek to RESTORE our Church to its former glory for honoring Jesus Christ. Consider it REFORM from within.
1307693431947436040 2020-09-20 22:49:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MarkMetts3 So very true!
1307693260249456641 2020-09-20 22:49:03 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MarkMetts3 GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!
1307692450954215428 2020-09-20 22:45:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Dbargen I just don’t want to be “preaching to the choir.”
1307692246456827906 2020-09-20 22:45:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Not sure we want to “limit” our comments to like minded followers unless I’m misunderstanding the intent here but I want the opposition to see and even challenge my tweets. That gives me the opportunity to answers their challenge intelligently and not emotionally.
1307657184419995650 2020-09-20 20:25:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This teacher while having a right to her opinion, does not have the right to attempt to indoctrinate her students. Further things she states as fact ARE HIGHLY DISPUTABLE. What she calls a bad job by Trump, MANY OF US think are VERY GOOD. We can state very solid reasons why.
1307648960203456512 2020-09-20 19:53:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @bpolitics Senator Collins has a right to her OPINION on this issue but she is SIMPLY WRONG.  Trump is and will be President until at least Jan. 19; that’s a full 4 months and adequate time for confirmation hearings. The president’s duties don’t end because an election may be in process.
1307642330539851776 2020-09-20 19:26:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @WPatriot2 @SenatorCollins Yes he is clearly President not just until Nov. 3 BUT AT KEAST UNTIL JAN. 19, 2021. We expect him to be president until Jan. 19, 2025. MAGA, KAG!!!
1307641584612245504 2020-09-20 19:23:43 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Shnrch33 The truth DOES SET YOU FREE. We need more TRUTH and LESS PROPAGANDA and over reaction.
1307511841879457792 2020-09-20 10:48:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JulietteAkinyi @RealCandaceO Hey, at least Candace could handle her beer. Who knows? Maybe Amy was changing Candace’s diaper so of course she touched her butt cleaning it. Dems will always make mountains out of molehills.
1307510351647383552 2020-09-20 10:42:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @RealCandaceO @truthsus I love it. LOL
1307510041180856322 2020-09-20 10:41:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Kenny_Sowellfan @RealCandaceO So true, but leftists aren’t interested in truth - they’re only interested in propaganda &amp; indoctrination. Tell a lie big enough and long enough and you begin to believe it yourself. That defines leftists - facts &amp; truth don’t matter to them.
1307508887252279296 2020-09-20 10:36:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @RealCandaceO @debrasmith48 lol
1307508606628229123 2020-09-20 10:35:18 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JoeBiden @scotty_kiker You must lose in order to preserve our country. The policies you and the Democrat party propose would be disastrous. Anyone with an ounce of understanding of economics knows that your policy proposals would lead to immense job losses. It would be worse than Covid.
1307507215696355331 2020-09-20 10:29:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex I don’t judge your motives. I WANT TO BELIEVE that your heart is in the right place but it has become increasingly difficult to do so for me and MANY other Catholics. Too many comments regarding political issues leave us wondering. We expect you to be the ship’s rudder.
1307505351579893762 2020-09-20 10:22:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex Meanwhile, China &amp; India would be allowed to continue with minimal environmental restrictions. The US already has very low pollution and has taken appropriate steps to control it further. You seem to beat animosity toward the US, why?
1307504542494461953 2020-09-20 10:19:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex The US has been a leader in the area having created the EPA (The law was enacted on January 1, 1970.) It wasn’t until 20 years later that the UK created similar laws. China &amp; India are far behind in this area. The Paris Accords were a fiasco - imposing heavy burdens on the US.
1307502650020298752 2020-09-20 10:11:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Pontifex I suggest Your Excellency that you become far more enlightened in the subject of environmentalism. The SCIENCE is not so one sided. Keep in mind Peter’s vision when he declined eating animals created by God.
1307501590522335233 2020-09-20 10:07:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 3. Further, Your Excellency, you seem to have bought in to the radical elements of ENVIRONMENTALISM. The US was on the forefront with the EPA (Env. Protection Act) but it has been hijacked by radical elements. Please look deeper into both sides of this issue and reconsider.
1307501589666684928 2020-09-20 10:07:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 2.  How can any Catholic who believes in the tenets (Deposit of Faith) trust you and these Bishops? It appears to many Catholics that many of our present Catholic hierarchy have abandoned the flock in favor of a”SOCIAL AGENDA.”
1307501588345499654 2020-09-20 10:07:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 1. @Pontifex How can you and many of the Bishops support Joe Biden &amp; the American Democrat party for president of the USA. The Democrat party promotes late term abortion plus homosexual practice &amp; marriage. Those issues alone are bad enough but the platform is very anti family.
1307494135440564225 2020-09-20 09:37:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Brocktooon @parscale @SteveGuest The House has been under Democrat control since 2018. All those cites where riots are happening have Democrats in charge. They have been derelict in their duties. THEY CIULD request federal help but are TOO PROUD to do that. They’d rather fail as they’re doing.
1307493356591706112 2020-09-20 09:34:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @QisRussianlies @parscale You also don’t seem to understand that virtually all the riots/looting/fires are happening in states/cities under Democrat control. It’s time they accept responsibility and take control. Federal help must be requested by the mayor/governor.
1307492682990841857 2020-09-20 09:32:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @parscale Good job Brad. Perhaps you need to explain who controls the national guard and the process to bring in federal peace officers. Apparently too many people don’t understand that Trump can’t simply send help. It must be requested by state officials - mayor and/or governor.
1307491904431550464 2020-09-20 09:28:56 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @cancelsurvivor @Professing_Prof @parscale You are correct. It amazes me how a “professor” doesn’t understand something as basic as that. The military can only activate an NG or Military reserve unit for foreign action. The governor of a state is who activates an NG unit to assist in controlling domestic riots etc.
1307490980812251136 2020-09-20 09:25:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Professing_Prof @parscale Most people understand clearly he a mayor or governor must request federal help to control riots. Trump or any president can not send in help without that request. Sorry Prof. these riots/burning/looting is clearly on those Democrat mayors &amp; governors. Don’t mislead people!
1307490058748989440 2020-09-20 09:21:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ChicalinaT @Brocktooon @parscale @SteveGuest Amazing that those criticizing Trump over the riots don’t understand the law. Presidents do have limits on their powers.
1307489725326950401 2020-09-20 09:20:17 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @AhNow2 @parscale Check the laws. Presidents have no authority to send in troops/national guard or other fed law enforcement unless to protect federal property. The mayor of a city or governor control the NG &amp; the president can only respond if REQUESTED.  DEM run cities won’t ask for help.
1307488196666830855 2020-09-20 09:14:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @rsultzba Great job posting that last.

1307427834764365825 2020-09-20 05:14:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Rparkerscience Susan Collins is not a TRUE Republican. We need to get the right person to replace Justice Ginsberg ASAP. I see no valid reason to wait.

Add one hour/day and ensure that ALL relevant subjects are studied. They spend too much time on various “humanities” courses. Get back to essentials &amp; MAGA!
1307412351352799234 2020-09-20 04:12:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @2020TrumpUSA @tommcintyre1947 @Corbelious Unfortunately none of this is all that simple but neither is politics/civics rocket science. One should have a solid foundation in economics as well as civics. Accounting is based on math and economics.
1307411693182619648 2020-09-20 04:10:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @2020TrumpUSA @tommcintyre1947 @Corbelious I would agree with you for the most part but mathematics is essential. You can’t be an engineer or physicist w/o a solid foundation in math &amp; sciences. It’s the lawyers that we have an excess of. That’s why they try to litigate everything &amp; create nothing.
1307337016879853570 2020-09-19 23:13:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @chic_savage I share your sentiments Chic, but I also remember what Jesus said: “love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven.” We could even say she was a Hitler regarding the unborn.

1307328599427612672 2020-09-19 22:40:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Lots of nasty comments about Justice Ginsburg this morning. While I agree with some regarding her rulings/opinions (disagreeing with her rulings), I can’t agree with making nasty comments about her death. I could never agree with most of her opinions.
1307326043292868610 2020-09-19 22:29:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @chic_savage I understand your feelings but we as Christians should pray for her soul.
1307325352491077632 2020-09-19 22:27:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @no_silenced In fact, that’s all the news seems to be talking about.
1307325004548317189 2020-09-19 22:25:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @no_silenced It’s fact; got a WSJ newsflash last night plus all over the news this morning.
1307323915598008320 2020-09-19 22:21:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Happy Rosh Hashanah to you as well. That table setting looks sumptuous.

1307065690470391810 2020-09-19 05:15:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Yep and then the Dems tried to blame Trump saying he withheld funds.

Think about the things we are being called - Toxic masculinity, white supremacy and being referred to as racist of homophobic if we disagree with the left's narrative. Things are topsy-turvy.

1306280523409559552 2020-09-17 01:15:20 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @TNSociallyMissy Definitely not as that would allow a very few states with very highly populated cities to impose their will on the other 40-43 states which have vastly different situations there.

1305903399838375938 2020-09-16 00:16:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @inittowinit007 @realDonaldTrump This needs to go VIRAL! Obama has been given a pass by the media his entire time in office and before &amp; after. It's time to EXPOSE him for what he really was - A CROOK.

1305900049679945730 2020-09-16 00:03:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Rparkerscience @gatewaypundit ALWAYS LOOK BENEATH THE SURFACE OF ANY ORGANIZATION. What's in the book isn't always what the cover depicts.
1305899807278600193 2020-09-16 00:02:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @RougePatriotOne These people want to take away the ability of law officers to do their job and/or defend themselves. What kinds of idiots are they? What are they thinking?
1305899339164905473 2020-09-16 00:00:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @realDonaldTrump We must all be aware; the ayatollahs in Iran bear no good will toward any American of America.
1305892999726067712 2020-09-15 23:35:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @EMastrro Serves him right; that was totally stupid and unlawful behavior. He’s lucky he wasn’t seriously injured or even killed
1305892387391234053 2020-09-15 23:33:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @telb77 @BreitbartNews These are our real HEROES and not the various sports figures. Those sports figures (athletes???) are taking all of the money from all those with FAR LESS MONEY and laughing all the way to the bank. Few of them put back into society vs what they received from society.
1305890667797897216 2020-09-15 23:26:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @sjorolan @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov @TheJusticeDept They (ANTIFA) are being investigated &amp; I’m sure the money trail will be followed. Much of the money supporting them is being laundered to hide the actual donors.
1305889849153552386 2020-09-15 23:22:56 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 So very true. This election cycle many Democrats are acting like SHEEP led to the slaughter. What amazes me is that otherwise intelligent people can not seem to know or understand what the Dems platform says. They need to inform themselves &amp; understand the consequences.
1305888826771025920 2020-09-15 23:18:53 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Rparkerscience Guess we could refer to him as : HIDIN,  LYIN, BIDEN.  That pretty well sums it up.
1305846666831028227 2020-09-15 20:31:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @GSMNP_Hiker In 2013, my wife &amp; I spent 26 days touring some major cities in Europe. Seven of those days were spent hiking the Camino de Santiago - 108 miles from O’Cebriero to Santiago. I was 70 &amp; she 63 at the time.
1305836629731483655 2020-09-15 19:51:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @tommcintyre1947 Many of these fires could have been controlled if proper management had been practiced. That means fire breaks and removal of most deadwood from the areas subject to fires.
1305835266297524225 2020-09-15 19:46:03 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> ALERT ALL TRUMP SUPPORTERS!!! Twitter is making more noise about censoring Trumps tweets particularly on election night. Be prepared to retweet anything supportive of Trump on both Election Day and the evening before.
1305686645883236353 2020-09-15 09:55:29 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @scotty_kiker Yes,why not? He was murdered by his black neighbor in cold blood.
1305665729778397184 2020-09-15 08:32:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @blaze0497 Follow the money.
1305660478803320833 2020-09-15 08:11:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JmsPatriot Can we find a cell for her there?
1305653039328628736 2020-09-15 07:41:57 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @thetoyman1 And you people still plan on voting for Biden?!!! He's telling you he is going to steal you blind and you don't even realize it.
1305617358598307845 2020-09-15 05:20:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @no_silenced That sets precedent against all those other Governors and Mayors who have tried to shut things down in their states/cities.
1305614336254246916 2020-09-15 05:08:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @XArmandKleinX Texas style rally for Trump.
1305603147893739522 2020-09-15 04:23:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Old timers (like me) and all retirees take note. If you vote for Biden, you are throwing your money away.
1305573639618785280 2020-09-15 02:26:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @P4tR10tBoo To BP, keep up the good work.
1305569762072842241 2020-09-15 02:11:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 I traded comments w/3 people yesterday defending the reporter arrested while “covering” the demonstration at the emergency room where the 2 police who were shot in the head were taken. Mine showed concern for the woman officer who has a 6 year old son
1305564839234985985 2020-09-15 01:51:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Quoimio @NFL And we still have people worrying about a reporter who was arrested at the scene. My concern is for this mother and her 6 year old boy.
1305483232226541568 2020-09-14 20:27:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Jali_Cat @polishprincessh That was clearly inciting violence.
1305482658818949120 2020-09-14 20:24:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @DrShayPhD @LindaHeartofTX Thank you for your courage. Perhaps those attacking police over these various incidents should LOOK AT STATS OF POLICE MURDERED during the same time frame to put things into proper perspective. It’s far less than thugs being killed by police.
1305481828556582913 2020-09-14 20:21:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @freedragonfly17 @ReneeCarrollAZ @realDonaldTrump Obama is the essence of EVIL. How can people not see this?
1305480139267084288 2020-09-14 20:14:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Storm86447440 I add my sympathies to that. May God be at her side.
1305478143235555329 2020-09-14 20:06:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @vic777212718 @zeusFanHouse @POTUS @RudyGiuliani Unfortunately, this is happening in many other universities as well.
1305476058964209669 2020-09-14 19:58:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @currie14_kelly But will Joe “Hiden” Biden?
1305475842009698305 2020-09-14 19:57:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @WPatriot2 @stillgray Either people are going crazy or are just plain stupid. Never approach a police officer making an arrest particularly if you have ANYTHING in your hand. When told/asked, obey the officer’s instruction. THAT will keep you from possibly getting killed.
1305467913781096448 2020-09-14 19:26:19 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @vladimirchylik @realDonaldTrump I hope people understand just how IMPORTANT preventing PANIC and instead keeping people CALM in a time of crisis.
1305467099297517568 2020-09-14 19:23:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @PsychoMetalHed Very important choice of words.
1305466855553982464 2020-09-14 19:22:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Shnrch33 NOW THAT IS SUPPORTING A POSITIVE CAUSE.
1305466214475616256 2020-09-14 19:19:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @scotty_kiker Our prayers are with her for a fast and full recovery
1305465359969980416 2020-09-14 19:16:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @proudtigerlsu More poor judgement by Democrats.
1305333011542675457 2020-09-14 10:30:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SRepasky Definitely agree.
1305332702586064897 2020-09-14 10:29:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SavvyMom428 @Humancrazy2 @LASDHQ I can see by your tone that you are becoming excessively emotional. If you can’t discuss the issue rationally I will be forced to block you.
1305332249861279750 2020-09-14 10:27:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SavvyMom428 @Humancrazy2 @LASDHQ I’m not opposed to getting rid of bad police anymore than any other criminal. I’m simply saying everyone deserves a fair trial in our system if justice. What doesn’t work is overreacting to every incident. Call for an outside investigation. There are solutions.
1305310077281284097 2020-09-14 08:59:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Humancrazy2 @SavvyMom428 @LASDHQ BTW, you're the one who brought up race in the first place. Or did you forget?
1305309817230290946 2020-09-14 08:58:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Humancrazy2 @SavvyMom428 @LASDHQ All I can say at this point is I hope you never sit on a jury. Given the thought processes you have displayed, you would would convict someone without listening to ALL the evidence. Yes, there is almost always more than one side to an issue. You sound very upset.
1305309106551631873 2020-09-14 08:55:17 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @BoDenver5 I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
1305305210844319751 2020-09-14 08:39:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Humancrazy2 @SavvyMom428 @LASDHQ I never mentioned race. Why does "your side" constantly have to bring race into everything. You don't even know what race I am. It really isn't about race; its far more about criminal behavior.
1305301673074712577 2020-09-14 08:25:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Humancrazy2 @SavvyMom428 @LASDHQ The next time someone attacks you or breaks into your home, please call a news reporter instead of dialing 911 for the police.
1305301474868592640 2020-09-14 08:24:57 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Humancrazy2 @SavvyMom428 @LASDHQ Not high and might at all but I certainly believe that rarely are ALL the facts known or available. Think, if you were accused of a crime, who would you want on your jury? Someone whose mind was made up before or someone who listened to both sides of the argument?  Your choice.
1305300904279789573 2020-09-14 08:22:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ThirtyOneMKs @Humancrazy2 @SavvyMom428 @LASDHQ We saw how everyone and especially Obama jumped to conclusions when the Ferguson issue happened. Before all investigations were done, other video surfaced from other angles showing the officer acted properly. He was found not guilty but his life had been ruined by conjecture.
1305300325398708230 2020-09-14 08:20:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ThirtyOneMKs @Humancrazy2 @SavvyMom428 @LASDHQ No, I believe in following the laws of the land. If the officer(s) are proven guilty in a fair trial after having been indicted by a grand jury, then they need to serve time as anyone else. RESISTING ARREST or INTEREFERING WITH entry to an emergency room is breaking the law.
1305299633749532672 2020-09-14 08:17:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @proudtigerlsu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump You have a point. Still my opinion is that we should do more boycotting of those businesses who work against the good of the US. And yes, disrespecting the Flag and National Anthem is working against the good of the US. It sends a bad image of our country to our enemies.
1305299009742008324 2020-09-14 08:15:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SavvyMom428 @Humancrazy2 @LASDHQ You seem to forget that there were two police officers who were ambushed and therefore that was attempted murder if they survive. What the hell was a crowd doing blocking access to that emergency room in the first place. They should all be put in jail.
1305298377173803008 2020-09-14 08:12:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SavvyMom428 @Humancrazy2 @LASDHQ Stop the criminal activity and you won't even have to address these issues. When I'm stopped, I show total respect for the police officer and obey his orders. Yes, I said orders. That's the safe, intelligent thing to do. Never interfere with what's going on.
1305297462660411392 2020-09-14 08:09:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SavvyMom428 @Humancrazy2 @LASDHQ Conveniently, virtually all of those involved in these actions have had a criminal record. Floyd was pumped up on Fentanyl plus other drugs. No one wants to admit that these killings would never have taken place if the person had not put himself in that situation in the first pl.
1305296829169401859 2020-09-14 08:06:29 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ThirtyOneMKs @Humancrazy2 @SavvyMom428 @LASDHQ So now you're going to be prosecutor, judge and jury. That's really the American spirit.
1305289618380787713 2020-09-14 07:37:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @donaldrusso994 @PillLlc Regardless of the details reporters need to keep a safe distance from any police action. When you get too close you are apt to be mistaken for another criminal protestor.
1305287440983261184 2020-09-14 07:29:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Humancrazy2 @SavvyMom428 @LASDHQ We’re you there at the location the WHOLE time? Videos don’t always show everything nor every angle. It’s wise not to judge beforehand. That’s why we have a court system with a jury to whom ALL the facts are presented by BOTH sides.
1305280507047968768 2020-09-14 07:01:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @NeelyJudi @LASDHQ My sentiments as well. She have gotten the hell out of the way.
1305280212314271745 2020-09-14 07:00:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @thk311 @LASDHQ @frankjtristan @josie_huang Regardless, she should have moved back when ordered to do so by police in the act of making an arrest. No excuses are valid in these instances.
1305279656720060417 2020-09-14 06:58:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @rehashingverse @CShadegg @LASDHQ I would take the word of the police based purely on what I have personally witnessed. Reporters have a tendency to get too close frequently interfering with an arrest whether intentional or not.
1305275507525799936 2020-09-14 06:41:46 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Geopilot @Rparkerscience @gatewaypundit OAN is ch 347 on DirecTV and Newsmax is ch 349. Both are good alternates to Fox News.
1305212365818994688 2020-09-14 02:30:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @CIG_KingJames Most BIASED and distorted “reporting” ever.
1305211132689485832 2020-09-14 02:25:58 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @sophialdeluca @ShawnScanlon3 @firelooker If you are so blind as to vote for Biden, an empty suit who accomplished nothing in over 40 years, you deserve him. His &amp; Democrats proposed policies  are a recipe for economic disaster. Anyone understanding economics knows raising taxes &amp; adding regs will stifle the economy
1305187491121631232 2020-09-14 00:52:01 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Rich55ard5 @CIG_KingJames @awlatlanta @POTUS I agree with you but I guess some people are such SLAVES OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY that they can’t see the forest (big picture) for the trees (little picture).
1305186708200321027 2020-09-14 00:48:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @CIG_KingJames @JennyCone81 @POTUS If you’ve had enough of the “POLITICAL CORRECTNESS BS,” you should love Donald Trump. You may or may not like him or what he says BUT HE STANDS BEHIND HIS EVERY WORD. Others try to twist what he says to fit their denigrating narrative.
1305185657799741441 2020-09-14 00:44:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MarkMetts3 @SpartacusLives Please publish and publicize the list. There are CONSEQUENCES to those companies’ AND PRO/SPORTS actions. ITS CALLED LOSS OF REVENUE.
1305184936236810241 2020-09-14 00:41:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @PJMedia_com @Corbelious All CPS need to be THROUGHLY investigated.
1305183460697481216 2020-09-14 00:36:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MarkMetts3 There is only ONE US FLAG &amp; ONE NATIONAL ANTHEM.  To NFL &amp; players:  STOP TRYING TO STOKE THE FIRES AND DIVIDING OUR COUNTRY! That is a losing proposition; NO ONE WANTS TO PAY TO SEE YOU DEMONSTRATE!!! I love football but this isn’t football; this is BS!!!
1305183169600258048 2020-09-14 00:34:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @MarkMetts3 There is only ONE US FLAG &amp; ONE NATIONAL ANTHEM.  To NFL &amp; players:  STOP TRYING TO STOKE THE FIRES AND DIVIDING OUR COUNTRY! That is a losing proposition; NO ONE WANTS TO PAY TO SEE YOU DEMONSTRATE!!!
1305181226245001216 2020-09-14 00:27:08 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JudicialWatch @TomFitton We need to hammer this like a nail.  The Biden’s need to be TRULY exposed for what they are.
1305179093231689728 2020-09-14 00:18:39 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @michaeljohns @realDonaldTrump @bbcbrasil We all need to spread the word about all the positives about President Trump.
1305178897412222986 2020-09-14 00:17:52 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> So true but GROSSLY UNDER REPORTED by MSM. IF Trump &amp; his team don’t TOOT THEIR OWN HORN, all those he has helped won’t even realize what he has actually done. Unfortunately, MSM also tries to bash OUR President rarely giving him recognition for all his accomplishments.
1305177650382725131 2020-09-14 00:12:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @LindaHale8006 @Jali_Cat @POTUS That is absolutely what is needed today. Too many have bought in to the “me first” or simply me, me,me way of thinking. Think about others first and we won’t have to worry so much about BIG government trying to do everything for everyone whose is impossible.
1305176680152084481 2020-09-14 00:09:04 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Time4aNapNow @DomoLJub45 Politically correctness. LOL
1305176555593834496 2020-09-14 00:08:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @DomoLJub45 That would be the coup de grâce.
1305175250980798466 2020-09-14 00:03:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JTrentkemp1 We always need to look beneath the surface; what we see needs to be confirmed by what we cannot see. Don’t jump to conclusions.
1305174702202277891 2020-09-14 00:01:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SpotdogWright That is what happens when voters are uninformed. Look beneath the surface left wing news reporting and propaganda. VOTE RED!!!
1305121800335101952 2020-09-13 20:30:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @drea_ams @SenTedCruz @netflix @TheJusticeDept It is so typical if Hollywood pushing the envelope. Not a fan of regulation but this needs to be reigned in. Hollywood has shown they have no morals nor sense of propriety.
1305121010870616065 2020-09-13 20:27:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SenTedCruz @netflix @TheJusticeDept If not pornography, it’s definitely promoting child sexual behavior and a form of child abuse. What about the parents of the kids performing those moves? Abuse???
1305116493680607232 2020-09-13 20:09:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @sophialdeluca @ShawnScanlon3 @firelooker Apparently he no longer claims you as his official (non - DC) residence is now in Florida, the sunshine state instead of the “gloom &amp; doom” state.
1305115820239065088 2020-09-13 20:07:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @michaeljohns @realDonaldTrump Those are the real heroes.

1305114514891866112 2020-09-13 20:02:02 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @michaeljohns Essentially what I wrote about a couple of days ago plus longer ago. Very little attention paid to it though. Thanks for highlighting this issue.

He is not a politician spouting empty words. His way is for government to get out of peoples’ way to the maximum possible. We gladly claim him because we know his heart.
1305109620751556614 2020-09-13 19:42:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @ShawnScanlon3 @firelooker Trump does what he says. Democrats have been an obstacle virtually all the way. They have become total obstructionists.

He has cow-towed to the radicals &amp; mismanaged the California forests. When you fail to clear cut areas of forest, you promote the spread of fires &amp; impede the ability if firefighters to contain.

1304860803233910784 2020-09-13 03:13:53 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @PatriotPirate74 I have no reason to believe otherwise. There is much evidence however regarding hatred by some Radical Islamic factions toward the US.

1304842901369827329 2020-09-13 02:02:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @LadyLoveMAGA @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @POTUS He’s been trying to help but Democrats keep trying to add non related JUNK/pork into the bills proposed by Republicans or simply block Rep. proposed bills.
1304842282944942082 2020-09-13 02:00:17 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @CIG_KingJames Maybe there is one bright spot in the Democrat party. Tulsi Gabbard.
1304832368943955969 2020-09-13 01:20:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> My 9000+ figure has to be extrapolated from the co-morbidities since the ACTUAL number due specifically/only to Covid-19 is nowhere to be found. CDC does list all the other causes involved with a covid-19 listed death though in those 175,866 Covid involved deaths.
1304829181877006337 2020-09-13 01:08:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 3. Numbers alone without UNDERLYING FACTS can be extremely misleading. I can only conclude that the MSM and in particular CNN, MSNBC and a few others purposely mislead the public in order to malign President Trump.
1304829181054902274 2020-09-13 01:08:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 2. Approximately 9000+ deaths are listed as directly CAUSED by Covid-19.  Many of the deaths listed as Covid-19 involved would have happened regardless. Further a large no was due to the actions of Governors of NY, NJ, Mass. &amp; Michigan returning patients to nursing homes.
1304829180140552193 2020-09-13 01:08:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 1. Mass media is still trying to scare people by over-reporting the death numbers RELATED to Covid-19. YES, I did say related. A check of the CDC ( https://t.co/eJYgnhnZNw) Updated Sep. 9, shows 175,866 deaths INVOLVING Covid-19 against 1,894,447 from all causes.
1304817254555623427 2020-09-13 00:20:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Remember, Florida's police union who never endorsed a presidential candidate before also endorsed Trump.
1304816918952632320 2020-09-13 00:19:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The "stuff" may soon hit the fan! If she has evidence as stated, it could blow things wide open. Virologist claims coronavirus is manmade   https://t.co/YwrdKd7kf8 via @Femail
1304816513174704128 2020-09-13 00:17:53 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @FloridaSharkman @gatewaypundit Reallu unbelievable is that there are enough SUPPOSEDLY INTELLIGENT people out there who will still vote for the Harris-Biden (no mistake-intentional) ticket. How can anyone be for KILLING unborn, IRRATIONAL Green New Deal, RAISING TAXES and reinstating the draconian Obama regs.
1304812583279525890 2020-09-13 00:02:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @BobRmhenry1 @StevenRCorey1 Keep in mind though, some wildfires will still be unpreventable; Good management will help minimize their spread though.
1304812225408962562 2020-09-13 00:00:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @FloridaSharkman @gatewaypundit Ha, ha, ha! More than laughable, it's unbelievable.
1304811377136144384 2020-09-12 23:57:29 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @DrEstella @BernieSanders @RashidaTlaib That picture should tell you a lot!
1304811001926291463 2020-09-12 23:55:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @BobRmhenry1 @StevenRCorey1 There was a similar problem with the pine bark beetle in the heavy pine forests of East Texas.  Removing most of the deadwood and clear-cutting strips of pine forest reduced/eliminated the problem for the most part.
1304810525717655552 2020-09-12 23:54:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @BobRmhenry1 @StevenRCorey1 Refer to: Prescribed Burning - Texas Parks and Wildlife -  https://t.co/3xRP87vxjV for more on this management technique.
1304809212623585281 2020-09-12 23:48:53 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @BobRmhenry1 @StevenRCorey1 Also cutting large swaths, sometimes called fire lanes or breaks help to prevent the spread of wildfires. Additionally, they allow firefighters better access to control the spread of these frequent fires. California environmentalists have stood in the way of these practices.
1304808764198080515 2020-09-12 23:47:06 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @BobRmhenry1 @StevenRCorey1 Clear cutting and removal of deadwood from the forests helps to control the bark beetle. Controlled fires/burns are a way of managing and renewal of both forests and grasslands. In Texas, "prescribed burning" is done usually between Late Nov. &amp; Feb. by Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife.

1304770939369009154 2020-09-12 21:16:48 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @reallyjoebiden Total misinformation; there has been no dismantling of any of the USPS. That is misinformation that Pelosi was spreading around.
1304766993011273729 2020-09-12 21:01:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JoanneRixon It seems that you need to wake up and pull your head out of the sand. Have you not been keeping up with just who is behind ANTIFA AND BLM? Perhaps you should read the BLM "manifesto," "What We Believe." There is clearly a plot to destroy the US from inside.
1304766263894454272 2020-09-12 20:58:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This is exactly what Michael Crichton depicted in hid book "State of Fear." He predicted (in fact gave examples in his story which is fiction but based of factual data) that the radical environmentalists would go to extremes to create events/situations that might appear natural.
1304425987812347911 2020-09-11 22:26:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Corbelious But he isn’t bowing like Obama did to foreign leaders.

1304377051189858304 2020-09-11 19:11:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 DISGUSTING!!!
1304376940598525957 2020-09-11 19:11:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> You can also attribute much of the violence in society today to both Hollywood and the video game industry for promoting/glorifying violence via movies and video games. Again, parents share some of the blame as well.
1304376916040876034 2020-09-11 19:11:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> What is wrong is that we have the movie industry promoting things like Netflix’s new movie “Cuties.” Tucker Carlson showed a clip last night. AND what about the Moms &amp; Dads” who allowed their 11 year old children to participate.
1304209843759263744 2020-09-11 08:07:12 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @hightide172 Very wise statements by Booker T Washington.

1304128051673001987 2020-09-11 02:42:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @thetoyman1 Hang in there and do what you can for the pain.
1304127902921957376 2020-09-11 02:41:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 5. The Church is bigger than all the priests, bishops or the Pope and will survive any and all. Remember that even of those directly selected by Jesus Himself, one (Judas 8+%) betrayed Him. How can we expect a successor to be more perfect than those Jesus Himself selected.
1304127902032834564 2020-09-11 02:41:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 4. Priests and other church leaders are still human beings and subject to sin as anyone. Papal infallibility as it's used in the church does not apply to any and all decisions by a Pope; it only applies in very special and limited cases. Seldom has it ever been invoked.
1304127901063839745 2020-09-11 02:41:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 3. There wasn't a REFORMATION; it was desertion. A study of history shows the Catholic Church came directly from Jesus through Peter and the Apostles. The "reformers" simply didn't have the courage/strength to make those corrupt leaders in the church be accountable. They left!
1304127900174688261 2020-09-11 02:41:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 2.  Unfortunately, too many have been too FEARFUL and have caused many faithful to leave the Church. Many of us however choose to stay and fight for OUR CHURCH unlike those like Martin Luther who left the church to start their own religion. Today more than ever, we need to do it.
1304127899323297798 2020-09-11 02:41:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 1. There are a few really good priests and bishops like Fr. James Altman and Bishop Strickland who are not afraid to state what Catholic (AND BIBLICAL) teaching is about abortion and homosexual activity. Too many have fallen in line with "cultural changes" re: sexual issues.
1304121367122644992 2020-09-11 02:15:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 @whobedannyd I've had that happen with my Chevron card when I filled up my wife's vehicle and went right back to fill my truck. They denied my card that I had just used. It was mostly my fault as they did text me but I never saw the text.
1304120149172158464 2020-09-11 02:10:47 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @whobedannyd @dodiewill2 Very Good!!! Didn't know you had it in you, lol
1304107651169689600 2020-09-11 01:21:07 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @marklutchman I agree with you because rioters are not "Peaceful Demonstrators."
1304107015162265600 2020-09-11 01:18:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @realDonaldTrump Bob Woodward's book is being released now less than 60 days b4 the elections in order to create distrust in President Trump. The President acted correctly in avoiding panic and most intelligent people recognize that that is the correct position to take. Fauci downplayed it too.
1304104475511193606 2020-09-11 01:08:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @scotty_kiker Yes but he was a White criminal; you could actually call him a domestic terrorist - a twisted mind.
1304103466072264710 2020-09-11 01:04:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Brian Stelter apparently lives in his own ALTERNATE REALITY.  Either that or he is simply nothing more than a Democrat mouthpiece. His show "Reliable Sources" should be named "UNRELIABLE SOURCES" as that is a much more accurate label for it.

1304092059511459845 2020-09-11 00:19:10 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @CIG_KingJames A leader must consider all the facts. Fauci and other political leaders advising Trump were downplaying the virus. If Trump had made strong statements openly as confided to Bob, he would have been ridiculed by all. Rem. ,Pelosi on 2/14/20 @ Chinese NY celebration?!!!
1304082010533703681 2020-09-10 23:39:14 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @CIG_KingJames The virus is bad but MSM still “over hyped” it &amp; is now trying to attack Trump. He did downplay it but that was like a military general trying to prevent fear from overwhelming his troops. Apparently Woodward &amp; the MSM don’t understand that. His presentation is a hatchet job.

Altman stated that you can’t be Catholic &amp; vote Democrat because of the Democrat party platform regarding moral issues. MORALS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CHURCHES.
1304018910946226177 2020-09-10 19:28:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gailsline The Catholic Church has been under attack from all directions both from within &amp; from outside.

1303437163745419266 2020-09-09 04:56:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @realDonaldTrump   We will both be proudly voting for President Trump. TURN EVERY STATE RED from mayor, governor, US Representatives, US Senators to and including President Trump!!! He is entitled to Representatives and Senators willing to work with instead of against him.
1303437162902441984 2020-09-09 04:56:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Today, my wife (70) &amp; I (77) received our Absentee Ballot request forms in the mail. I just shredded them so that they couldn't fall into the wrong hands.  We feel STRONGLY THAT THE PRIVILEGE TO VOTE IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE WILLING TO TAKE ANY RISK TO VOTE IN PERSON.
1303435533364924416 2020-09-09 04:50:22 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @HillaryClinton @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Joe Biden has a HISTORY OF FAILURE IN HIS 40+ years in Washington. A vote for Joe is a vote for the OLD GUARD/ELETISTS who think they know how to run your life better than you do AND how to spend your money better than you do via higher taxes and more regulations.
1303434933902475264 2020-09-09 04:47:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @HillaryClinton @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Once again, you have FRAMED THE CHOICES ERRONEOUSLY. The choice is between FREEDOM, LOW TAXES, REASONABLE REGULATIONS, A STRONG ECONOMY (DONALD TRUMP) &amp; the opposite - HIGHER TAXES, REVERT TO OBAMA ERA REGS AND A TANKING ECONOMY (Joe Biden). Clear difference - choose wisely!

1303393161096695810 2020-09-09 02:02:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JohnHP8220 Anyone thinking black on white crime doesn't exist has never bothered to check the statistics. MSM seldom reports it bc it's so common. Black on black is probably most prevalent though. Obama filled blacks with his hope and change message but left them hanging. Obama instigated!
1303391777378963456 2020-09-09 01:56:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JohnHP8220 ABSOLUTELY!!! And it's much harder to cheat too.
1303391551238922240 2020-09-09 01:55:36 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @JohnHP8220 This shows just how desperate Democrats are. They have no principles! That is what happens when you don't give God His due. Remember the pledge of Allegiance at the DNC; they removed Under God from it. The bible clearly says what happens to those who don't acknowledge HIM.

They know how easy it is to cheat and that's why they are pushing vote by mail so hard. They are afraid that Trump will trounce them in the general elect.
1303390080757903361 2020-09-09 01:49:45 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @tommcintyre1947 Apparently American Airlines has not read "What We Believe" posted/published by BLM. If they have, their are either:  1.

1303388655336263680 2020-09-09 01:44:05 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> The following Washington Post article under "Microsoft News" is the most BIASED article and is an example of YELLOW JOURNALISM.

I feel sorry for the renters if Covid was the cause, but the property owners expenses continue as well. Ultimately, someone has to pay. Perhaps a rent relief assistance program is needed - temporary.

1303037316055916544 2020-09-08 02:28:00 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That statement by Khrushchev was posted in the Orlando Sentinel on July 16, 2018 but made in the 1956. Our fear should be of those within our country who have forsaken our founding fathers’ ideals. That is  why Khrushchev made his statement.
1303037313539334146 2020-09-08 02:27:59 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We can’t afford to allow China to amass military strength unchallenged. Communists have always wanted and tried to take over the world. Go back and look up the words of Khrushchev. Letters: Nikita Khrushchev's chilling prediction: 'We will take America without firing a shot'

I had three older brothers in Korea at the same time. Superior numbers of foot soldiers don’t equate to superior forces. We lost 36,516  personnel in that war.

1301981039292641280 2020-09-05 04:30:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> General Correction. The CDC table 1 has not been reformatted. Viewing it on my iPhone, I was unable to see the whole chart at once.

1301928444473741313 2020-09-05 01:01:44 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @archerenemy I would agree with that. Democrat operatives are lurking everywhere.

How long will it take for people to realize just what BLM is?  It is not an organization with the best interests of black people but one that wants to destroy society, not improve it.
1301926595687452672 2020-09-05 00:54:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @archerenemy Interesting that as of this morning, the table 1 that I copied just yesterday has been revised making it much harder to decipher.
1301901429859254272 2020-09-04 23:14:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Bishopoftyler This is especially true in this time when so many irrationally fear Covid. It is a nasty virus but deaths “related” to it need to be put into proper perspective.

1301860804497612801 2020-09-04 20:32:57 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @AALIVESMATTER By the way, it’s Chris Wallace. I wouldn’t trust Donna Brazile with anything.
1301859116642496513 2020-09-04 20:26:15 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @PamSimson @LindaHale8006 Table 3 of the report gives much of the detail that you were talking about. I’m perplexed that since I posted the excerpt of table 1, CDC has changed the format only 1 day after they initially posted it. It’s much harder to draw any conclusions from it now.
1301856165295390722 2020-09-04 20:14:31 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @PamSimson @LindaHale8006 If you go to the full table, you will see a somewhat detailed list of the other causes of death. I too would like to see how many deaths came from various drug overdoses. Too much information is “filtered” before we see it. Trump pushed for more transparent reporting.
1301708196516519937 2020-09-04 10:26:33 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Rparkerscience @Deplorable4Trum @gatewaypundit But “they” say there’s no evidence of voter fraud. That’s why we need voter ID AND in person voting. Mail in ballots only sent to those specifically requesting and not sent out  in mass mailings. There is no means of verification.
1301706393922146304 2020-09-04 10:19:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @pnjkrull The mail-in votes are too easily doctored or destroyed.

He professes to be Catholic but supports abortion w/o limits and gay marriage. Both opposite if Catholic and Biblical teaching. He is a total phony. Yes Trump has a past just like King David but Trump didn’t murder anyone.
1301702933654904832 2020-09-04 10:05:38 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @SannaFitzler @gailsline @RL9631 @realDonaldTrump That’s the result of one party’s operatives trying to sway voters &amp; inflate Covid numbers. The majority of deaths were elderly (65 &amp; older) AND w/compromised immune systems due to underlying cond’s. That and the governors in 4 states sent infected elderly back to nursing homes.
1301693357349957634 2020-09-04 09:27:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @pnjkrull Makes perfect sense if you’re a Democrat wanting your harvest votes.
1301691992234102785 2020-09-04 09:22:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> That is a disgusting mess.
1301691679569711106 2020-09-04 09:20:55 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gailsline @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump Actually that is exactly Jo Biden &amp; Democrats America. Those are all Democrat mayors &amp; governors in the cities with “peaceful protestors” pillaging, burning and otherwise destroying others property and lives. The Democrat party has been instigating &amp; supporting these RIOTERS.
1301690401737175040 2020-09-04 09:15:50 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Chris Wallace is a HORRIBLE CHOICE to moderate a debate between Trump and Biden. He has REPEATEDLY shown animosity toward Trump in both interviews and reporting. Chris pretends to be neutral but his bias shows through.

1301662675945033728 2020-09-04 07:25:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> Jury Duty Summons.   Last year 449,163 Calif’s rec’d a jury duty summons to which they declined,using the "I am not a citizen, therefore I cannot sit on a jury” provision    Source for jury duty summons is the VOTER REGISTRATION-list. Say what???   Think about that for a minute.

1301142622522597378 2020-09-02 20:59:09 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Geopilot @dodiewill2 @yitzgood That business of burning people at the stake has been debunked by more updated research. The Spanish inquisitions were just that - trials. Some civil authorities did burn people at the stake. Protestant reformers put forth that line to disparage the Catholic Church.

There is no duplicity about the man. What you see/hear is what you get and he GETS THINGS DONE.

They are in fact failing their constituents by following Pelosi. The may well regret it in November.
1300955504651370496 2020-09-02 08:35:37 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @CatsTalkBack1 @moonlite_DTL I don’t know of a single city with a Republican mayor having these problems. Having a Republican Governor as we do in Texas helps too as he isn’t reluctant to send in the NG or accept federal help.

1300932053848875010 2020-09-02 07:02:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 @Geopilot The same is true about Catholicism. In my latter years I’ve had time to study treatises and books refuting it’s clarifying many false charges. In doing so, it also gave me insight to many practices that derive directly from ancient Jewish practices. After all, Jesus was a Jew!
1300929998560194564 2020-09-02 06:54:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 @Geopilot I would like to see chapter &amp; verse of what he was referring to. I’ve read the entire Bible (Catholic version) which includes 7 books that many protestant Bibles don’t include. I don’t recall anything that I would define as pedophilia.
1300928588015837184 2020-09-02 06:48:40 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Geopilot You just defined today’s Democrat party. Just look at their number of career politicians; that isn’t exactly being a government by the people FOR the people. Trump on the other hand has been in office 3+ years and gives his salary to charities. No personal monetary benefit.
1300922227299246080 2020-09-02 06:23:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> This is how all things should be clearly defined CFACT weighs in on species habitats:  https://t.co/wCvkhLhWBb

1300909722929778688 2020-09-02 05:33:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Geopilot @dodiewill2 That’s purely a Luis Farrakhan and Anti-Semitic inference. People all too often put their own interpretations on it. If you want an expert on the Talmud, ask a Rabbi. If you want an expert on Catholicism, ask a Priest or Bishop.
1300908178343784448 2020-09-02 05:27:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> A New Yorker &amp; Texan went to call God and the operator said that will be $10,000 for the New Yorker as it’s long distance. Meanwhile the Texan placed the same call &amp; it was only 25 cents. In Texas, it’s a local call.
1300906733905174528 2020-09-02 05:21:49 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @PressSec @donna_viestenz @realDonaldTrump Democrats are always a day late and many $$$$$ short. That’s because they always want to spend others’ money.
1300906149785419777 2020-09-02 05:19:30 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @HoToddi We will support you with our prayers from Texas.
1300905664647061504 2020-09-02 05:17:34 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @proudtigerlsu When you talk straight; you run the risk of offending some. Those truly interested in truth/facts realize that President Trump May be guilty of “puffery” but that is considered acceptable in marketing and is not lying. It’s common practice in marketing &amp; advertising.
1300904586840924160 2020-09-02 05:13:17 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> We have experienced TOO MANY “politically correct” presidents &amp; other office holders. They tell people “WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR RATHER THAN WHAT THEY NEED TO HEAR.” Combine that with a highly BIASED MEDIA making molehills into mountains blowing things out of proportion.
1300884436750184448 2020-09-02 03:53:13 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @gailsline @RogerMarshallMD @Texaswild7 Very well said AND verifiable.
1300882916294049792 2020-09-02 03:47:11 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 @Geopilot I would too; sexual mores have changed in that regard within all major religions EXCEPT the Islamic. Typically women married at age 15 in most historic info other than Islam. Islam permitted child brides.
1300880954018258945 2020-09-02 03:39:23 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 @Geopilot I second your reply.

1300879689263710208 2020-09-02 03:34:21 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @CIG_KingJames @POTUS Perhaps we are a “well armed and regulated (self) militia” as the second amendment clearly allows. It does not state WHO regulates this militia. We stand UNITED; divided they fall.
1300878964081135616 2020-09-02 03:31:28 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @tommcintyre1947 These are ALL FACTS!  Don’t let Democrats DECEIVE you any longer.
1300877483332390913 2020-09-02 03:25:35 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @FrankAmari2 @WhiteHouse Evidence of result? Otherwise, it’s just empty accusations like about fracking. The greenies once even faked a gas leak into a persons water well in Oklahoma &amp; lit the supposed gas to make it look like fracking caused gas to seep into water wells. It was later debunked.

1300825810874462208 2020-09-02 00:00:16 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @RogerMarshallMD @Texaswild7 Old Joe has joined and is gleefully supporting all the far left wing elements of the Democrat party. He has forsaken his professed religious belief and sold out to Satan. There is complete DUPLICITY on his “character.”
1300815653671071745 2020-09-01 23:19:54 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Hey the Talmud/Pentateuch or Old Testament has some pretty good ways of dealing with bad people.
1300815032943407104 2020-09-01 23:17:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 4. Biden would not only raise taxes and institute more regulation but would stop much oil/gas production by ending fracking. This action would significantly raise energy costs and double or triple peoples’ utility costs. THINK BEFORE YOU VOTE!!!
1300815031831949312 2020-09-01 23:17:26 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 3. Forcing green systems would raise utility rates unnecessarily. Part of the Dem platform is to stop fracking. Fracking has been in use over 50-60 years; it is directional/horizontal drilling that is more recent and has resulted in making the US the #1 producer and net exporter.
1300815029898375168 2020-09-01 23:17:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 2. Maximize electricity generation by hydro-electric plants wherever feasible/practical. Solar &amp; Wind turbine generators have obvious limitations &amp; require back-up generation systems. Battery storage is inadequate at this time.
1300815027151056897 2020-09-01 23:17:25 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> 1. Green energy is not a bad idea to help prolong the reserves of fossil fuel products. Gov’t mandates are not the way to go though. Allow competition to drive down their costs w/o gov’t. subsidy other than depreciation as w/any capital investment. Also recognize limitations.
1300801798559555592 2020-09-01 22:24:51 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @dodiewill2 Not as sure of how I would punish a woman for those same abuses. I’m sure I could think of something. The Bible speaks of tying a millstone around someone’s neck &amp; throwing them into the sea. Maybe it’s time to reconstitute some of those punishments.  Re: Matt. 18:6 (paraphrased)
1300800506269376514 2020-09-01 22:19:43 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @KarenRenePryor @gailsline Yes but that bag is full to overflowing and he uses them all.
1300800249028517890 2020-09-01 22:18:41 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Rparkerscience @gatewaypundit BTW, you may need a Catholic Bible to find the book of Daniel. It’s full of wisdom.
1300800000704692224 2020-09-01 22:17:42 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @Rparkerscience @gatewaypundit Let the legal system do its job BUT ENSURE HE GETS A FAIR TRIAL. There is video BUT also eyewitnesses.  I suggest doing what Daniel did in the case against Susanna. Daniel separated the 2 “witnesses” &amp; asked each to describe what happened. Each one lied and was punished duly.
1300798536062128128 2020-09-01 22:11:53 +0800 <JuliusMaresh> @vladimirchylik @andersoncooper @Trevornoah You stated it so well!  If the US is so terrible, why are so many willing to risk their very lives to come here. It’s because in spite of our faults, the US is the best &amp; most free nation in the world. Those who are unhappy here are FREE TO LEAVE for SA or wherever they choose.
