1344067282683748354 2020-12-30 07:46:26 +0800 <nismolivia> @Ka1ash_Offdog This is such an insane piece of redneck engineering I want it
1343955534639222785 2020-12-30 00:22:23 +0800 <nismolivia> Ok I actually did it and it was a lot harder than I thought because I found a bunch of good music this year.  https://t.co/REUntMyp1f
1343932921602826243 2020-12-29 22:52:32 +0800 <nismolivia> I should actually do a top albums of 2020 thing. It‚Äôd be a lot of fun to go back and see what I‚Äôve discovered
1343931082526388228 2020-12-29 22:45:13 +0800 <nismolivia> The outro song on megachurch is fucking incredible. Like it‚Äôs probably one of my favorite tracks I‚Äôve found in 2020
1343929850713825281 2020-12-29 22:40:20 +0800 <nismolivia> This album showed up on my discover weekly last week and I‚Äôve probably listened to it all the way through 6-7 times. It‚Äôs fucking fantastic.  https://t.co/limok4Qobz
1343926138716958721 2020-12-29 22:25:35 +0800 <nismolivia> Being an adult is getting a job you can‚Äôt call in sick too because you feel too much responsibility

1343676854448902150 2020-12-29 05:55:01 +0800 <nismolivia> I like to think I‚Äôm tough but some paper shifting on my desk just scared me

1343274547139792897 2020-12-28 03:16:23 +0800 <nismolivia> It‚Äôs really hard for me to say this since it‚Äôs so personal. But I feel like this is a safe space where I can talk about issues like this I finally went through with it and got SRS. As a trans person this really feels like the pinnacle of my journey.  https://t.co/sKFie00zUe
1342885164905598977 2020-12-27 01:29:07 +0800 <nismolivia> My favorite selfie on my camera roll is when I was complete drunk off wine in my apartment Jojo posing in front of a mirror in nothing but a bathrobe

1342349661349306368 2020-12-25 14:01:13 +0800 <nismolivia> @Rynyaa I‚Äôve been doing a exercise where I try to take a mythological creature and translate it into natural phenomenea.
1342349135916236802 2020-12-25 13:59:08 +0800 <nismolivia> @Rynyaa Big same, I‚Äôve drawn like 3 monsters outside of work and even then I‚Äôm still like bleh
1342271373310390274 2020-12-25 08:50:08 +0800 <nismolivia> @Rynyaa Fair, I just wanted to slide and a car that‚Äôs closer to stock is easier to fix. Plus emptying my savings on an lsd is rough
1342199511222022146 2020-12-25 04:04:34 +0800 <nismolivia> I miss my integra

1342189836971749378 2020-12-25 03:26:08 +0800 <nismolivia> When I got the g the intention was to make the equivalent of an hpde car for drifting. I understand now.
1342189661276545024 2020-12-25 03:25:26 +0800 <nismolivia> I remember when I was smol, naive, and thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show all those people you can build a dailyable, comfortable drift car‚Äù that was like 5 months ago.
1342188201549697026 2020-12-25 03:19:38 +0800 <nismolivia> @AlexVsFox I bought mine pre welded and was a dumbass and didn‚Äôt check to see if it was plate welded before I put it in. It was in a z that made way more power. So far it‚Äôs held up great after 5 months of daily driving. About 10k miles
1342185751824523265 2020-12-25 03:09:54 +0800 <nismolivia> @AlexVsFox I know your pain. I can feel mine on it‚Äôs way out.

1342120655588888578 2020-12-24 22:51:14 +0800 <nismolivia> @reefer_x They‚Äôve shown up on my disco weekly, ill give them a shot!

1341837614865911814 2020-12-24 04:06:32 +0800 <nismolivia> @HimikoTsuhane Volvos get as pass too. I‚Äôd put up with the effort to drive one of the nicer ones.
1341823792469962758 2020-12-24 03:11:36 +0800 <nismolivia> @HimikoTsuhane They‚Äôre not unreliable, but they‚Äôre impossible to fix at home. Unless you have the money to take it to a shop and have a pro do everything for you, fuck getting a modern euro car
1341818971977334785 2020-12-24 02:52:27 +0800 <nismolivia> @HimikoTsuhane No way I‚Äôm touching anything German post 2000. But the vk56 just makes any car good. Those motors slap so heavy. I was looking at the m45 cause they‚Äôre dropping in price. Seem like it would make a nice comfy cruiser
1341816834723614720 2020-12-24 02:43:57 +0800 <nismolivia> @HimikoTsuhane It‚Äôs cause Nissan doesn‚Äôt know how to make a good auto trans. Every single one feels like you have to file a request to get it to upshift. I haven‚Äôt driven a g37 yet but I bet you‚Äôre right. Im curious how the boatier m chassis drive
1341805228828598275 2020-12-24 01:57:50 +0800 <nismolivia> Anyway enough sad sappy shit here‚Äôs a video of me drifting  https://t.co/huuFmhxYHr
1341804032017444869 2020-12-24 01:53:05 +0800 <nismolivia> I just feel bad for who I was ya know, some of these people may have Been looking for a community or a safe space to be and I was a huge piece of shit to them
1341803225574457344 2020-12-24 01:49:53 +0800 <nismolivia> I would talk down to other trans folks who may not have been as lucky as I was with the genetics as of this is something they could easily change.
1341803059513618435 2020-12-24 01:49:13 +0800 <nismolivia> I spent so much of my time and energy trying to make my outward appearance ‚Äúperfect‚Äù and put so much importance on ‚Äúpassing‚Äù i really lost myself in the vanity of it all.
1341802078780469250 2020-12-24 01:45:19 +0800 <nismolivia> Honestly really happy I got off places like /lgbt/, /cd/, and other queer internet spaces. I feel like I would‚Äôve devolved into a vain, toxic person if I had stayed
1341801081458876423 2020-12-24 01:41:21 +0800 <nismolivia> @HimikoTsuhane In stock form they‚Äôre kinda lifeless. They have super sloppy suspension  and the auto trans really takes all life out of them. But poly bushings and coils woke it right up tbh
1341761539053916160 2020-12-23 23:04:14 +0800 <nismolivia> Still obsessed with this album. Brutal and industrial it‚Äôs one of my absolute favorites   https://t.co/otLHfmrPPd
1341741046687010817 2020-12-23 21:42:48 +0800 <nismolivia> Honestly this would be my idea little drift track. Something modular with a bunch of different layouts but still small enough that‚Äôs it‚Äôs technical  https://t.co/lSYQXpnft4

1339651902997454848 2020-12-18 03:21:17 +0800 <nismolivia> Another day another part breaks on my Nissan
1339598673332736000 2020-12-17 23:49:46 +0800 <nismolivia> I normally kill a strong cup of tea to help jump start my adhd meds but I think that was a bad idea with adderall

1339191652225789956 2020-12-16 20:52:25 +0800 <nismolivia> @Ka1ash_Offdog That looks terrifying. like something out of Chernobyl.

1337405211888021509 2020-12-11 22:33:44 +0800 <nismolivia> @Zaynay I had a gold bull ring before and that was my absolute favorite.

1335809661170315265 2020-12-07 12:53:36 +0800 <nismolivia> I‚Äôm about to sink my life and soul into muse dash
1330917563161841667 2020-11-24 00:54:08 +0800 <nismolivia> So yeah, that‚Äôs the thing im most proud of. Dumb artist obsessed with spinosaurus got something right about her favorite dinosaur
1330916768701952001 2020-11-24 00:50:59 +0800 <nismolivia> My theory was that spinosaurus was an aquatic ambush predator that would submerge itself in rivers and wait for larger prey to come by then drag them in and drown them.
1330916429059776513 2020-11-24 00:49:38 +0800 <nismolivia> Then the ibriham 2020 paler came out along with the new tail bones and I‚Äôm just like Oh fuck I was right
1330916221370454019 2020-11-24 00:48:49 +0800 <nismolivia> I stated spinosaurus was a the midpoint of a theropod evolving to an aquatic lifestyle and cited crocodilians skulls and body shape as evidence.
1330915993619750917 2020-11-24 00:47:54 +0800 <nismolivia> Still thinking about the time that the research paper I wrote in an introductory paleontology class about how spinosaurus was done dirty turned out to be correct.

1322268487402868741 2020-10-31 04:05:48 +0800 <nismolivia> @JoshLeeKwai Year of commander has been horrible for the format. I miss when wizards didn‚Äôt acknowledge it and we had to make cards designed for standard work in commander.
1319601182772514816 2020-10-23 19:26:53 +0800 <nismolivia> Thinking about the white on white g35. Probably gonna end up doing this to my g later on down the road with a set of 18 inch carbynes. I kinda wanna keep my trend of white nissans going  https://t.co/kAxpGSI72b

1310423545416167424 2020-09-28 11:38:14 +0800 <nismolivia> I love my g35 so much. She survived basically five straight hours of drifting
1310423340914532354 2020-09-28 11:37:25 +0800 <nismolivia> Idk if anything is more fun or addictive than drifting

1306947089218392072 2020-09-18 21:24:02 +0800 <nismolivia> I wanna get my car corner balanced
1306677547317571584 2020-09-18 03:32:58 +0800 <nismolivia> I loved world, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to play more of it.
1306677156349698051 2020-09-18 03:31:25 +0800 <nismolivia> YES THEYRE PUTTING MONSTER HUNTER BACK ON HANDHELD WHERE IT BELONGS
1305994561953685506 2020-09-16 06:19:02 +0800 <nismolivia> Man...I‚Äôm glad some things in life are just a phase
1305992183560929281 2020-09-16 06:09:35 +0800 <nismolivia> The poster in question. I had to remove the text from the Thai version and remake the text from the Japanese version  https://t.co/iX0OGGHGSQ
1305991197010337792 2020-09-16 06:05:40 +0800 <nismolivia> I‚Äôve heard of learning language through osmosis, but it‚Äôs wild that Im actually starting to relearn my japanese by making bootleg movie posters
1305703705564545026 2020-09-15 11:03:16 +0800 <nismolivia> Big shoutout to my Roomate for bringing me my spares after my dumbass thout it would be a good idea to hoon old ass tires
1305703008047632385 2020-09-15 11:00:30 +0800 <nismolivia> The welded is working goooood  https://t.co/ididRh06bR
1305702929559687168 2020-09-15 11:00:11 +0800 <nismolivia> Hey guys is this normal? Y‚Äôall think I can get it patched  https://t.co/WbHD6qM0M7

1305473593220964352 2020-09-14 19:48:53 +0800 <nismolivia> Why do I have to pay rent why can‚Äôt I get poly bushings, new tires, and a diff brace
1305473196292964352 2020-09-14 19:47:19 +0800 <nismolivia> Honestly I was not expecting how terrifying it is to drive on the highway with a welded diff in the rain.
1304084534988886017 2020-09-10 23:49:16 +0800 <nismolivia> I love my g35 and I don‚Äôt want her to die. I figure when the motor goes in a few years. I‚Äôll have the money saved up to put a built vq or v8 in it. For now it‚Äôs just babying her around town then wring her out at the track
1304064083881320450 2020-09-10 22:28:00 +0800 <nismolivia> @wakablockaflame They‚Äôre worth it. Like it‚Äôs one of those things that makes it just a step better.
1304062636976472065 2020-09-10 22:22:15 +0800 <nismolivia> I also bought a set of enkei nt03+m‚Äôs for $200 yesterday. They need to be cleaned and polished but they‚Äôre not bad at all. I‚Äôll post a pic once I‚Äôm off work
1304062337259839489 2020-09-10 22:21:04 +0800 <nismolivia> welded differentials are cool until you realize the stress it puts on your drivetrain is going to age everything so fast. I was gonna use the money from my next paycheck for more tires but looks like I need to get poly bushings üò≠
1304058757408862210 2020-09-10 22:06:50 +0800 <nismolivia> I put the welded diff in my car on Saturday and by Tuesday I blew the carrier bushing. Now it sounds like it‚Äôs dying when I‚Äôm in a parking lot
1303323051057131521 2020-09-08 21:23:24 +0800 <nismolivia>  https://t.co/3dJkiRFK9n  Morning jam
