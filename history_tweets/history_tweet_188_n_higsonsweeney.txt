1339579355589038093 2020-12-17 22:33:01 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> Had a catch-up and study date this morning with @charlton_k before Christmas, and I feel incredibly lucky and grateful to have found a PhD buddy to share my journey with 😌

1333790891572568065 2020-12-01 23:11:43 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> Exciting post today!  https://t.co/Bu4AC83hig
1333359375617060865 2020-11-30 18:37:02 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> I’m still trying to go into the office every now and then, but it’s strange how accustomed I’ve become to working from home and sitting at a desk in front of a window and natural light. My office has no windows and the lights make my eyes water 🥲
1332353184677945345 2020-11-27 23:58:47 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @BethanyJCliffe Yaaaas, smashing it!! 🤩
1332249889695293442 2020-11-27 17:08:20 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @jltil19 I can imagine! You’ll get it though and you’re going to be such a brilliant clinical psychologist! The PhD is going well thank you, just finished my first attempt at marking and am taking a day off to recover 😂 xx
1332072361307336709 2020-11-27 05:22:54 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @jltil19 I won’t lie, I was more tech support than teaching! 😅 but hoping to help out again next year when I have a bit more knowledge. How are you finding training Jacque?
1332035093712560130 2020-11-27 02:54:49 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> I had the absolute pleasure helping @MariaLoades to deliver some online teaching for Bath’s DClinPsy programme today! Encouraged and impressed by the current trainees and the next generation of clinical psychologists 😌
1331624879322492928 2020-11-25 23:44:46 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @SenselessPsych @UniofBath @BathPsychology Congrats! Website looks fantastic 🙌🏽
1331314953165418506 2020-11-25 03:13:14 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> I can guarantee you that I’m going to spend way too much time creating a mediocre Christmas card 🤶 looking forward to this!
1329860932265185282 2020-11-21 02:55:28 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @Jo_Higson To update to your title is getting me 😂
1329705336832462849 2020-11-20 16:37:11 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @vanessa123lloyd @_SWDTP I’m pretty sure it was recorded! Might be worth emailing or DMing the SWDTP to see how you could access it?
1329452296888086530 2020-11-19 23:51:42 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @C_Poku93 This is iconic! Congrats to all three of you!  https://t.co/NUgv4ATRsA

1328811324432932866 2020-11-18 05:24:42 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> There is a 13.3% gap between White students and BAME students receiving a 2:1 or above. There is a 22.6% gap between White students and Black students receiving a 2:1 or above.

1328650325163716608 2020-11-17 18:44:57 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> #CITEBLACKWOMEN  What a way to perpetuate the cycle you're trying to shed light on @BBCNewsnight. An apology and revisions are needed asap!
1328394671756873729 2020-11-17 01:49:04 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @BethanyJCliffe @discoverphds Aw, thank you Beth! ☺️
1328341423104675840 2020-11-16 22:17:29 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @abbiejones86 Thank you so much Abbie! Your reassurance always means a lot. I hadn't considered it as a forum topic but definitely think that would be worthwhile! Will suggest to Rosie and Steve :D
1328341091498815491 2020-11-16 22:16:10 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> If anyone is interested in learning a bit more about my PhD research plans, check out this overview on the UKRI gateway:  https://t.co/YFq4rZTS0H
1328314920618905606 2020-11-16 20:32:10 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> This is the first time I have ever marked essays and it's proving to be quite challenging! But it is getting easier as I go along (and I've also found a great marking playlist on spotify with all the best instrumental pieces from my favourite films)
1327336530801807361 2020-11-14 03:44:24 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @DrJaneMeyrick Oh my god yay!!!! Congrats 🥳

1326239359469752322 2020-11-11 03:04:38 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> Excited to be listening to Erika Forbes' talk 'Not feeling it: Adolescent depression and reward procesing gone awry' hosted by the Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation
1326134427999752194 2020-11-10 20:07:40 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @CharlotteJD Quick question - what are you using to annotate those papers? Looks good!
1326134130237698048 2020-11-10 20:06:29 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @liannabannister @HowlettGemma @fayehatcher @treventoured @drcoconnell Hi Lianna! I’m good thank you, how are you getting on? ☺️
1326099340339908608 2020-11-10 17:48:15 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @Dr_SJRennalls Congrats on the double doctorate, the new job, new house and your engagement! 🥳 I hope I will be able to say the same sort of thing in 5 years time 😌 you’re honestly an inspiration
1325391779659735041 2020-11-08 18:56:39 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> Come and join our book club for black women (inc. trans women, non binary &amp; gender non-conforming)! Book a free place here:  https://t.co/QDMKkASoet
1325115458320818177 2020-11-08 00:38:39 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> So pleased for everyone in the US! What a win 😄
1324759479834058753 2020-11-07 01:04:07 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> Cannot wait for this series! Would encourage all doctoral research students to sign up
1322597571668443139 2020-11-01 01:53:28 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> I’m learning that time management is vital during a PhD, and that it will look very bad if you schedule a meeting for 4pm, rearrange it for 5pm, and intend to actually do it at 6.30pm 👀
1322272501913821189 2020-10-31 04:21:45 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> Trigger warnings for self harm❗️  If you feel comfortable sharing your experiences (anonymously or in an interview) please reach out to Beth 😊
1322216789724565506 2020-10-31 00:40:22 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> Excited to see that the report I worked on during my research internship within the Equality, Diversity &amp; Inclusivity team @UWEBristol is available to read via the research repository:  https://t.co/QMhYgwfC2r Really hoping our findings translate into real-world change!
1322200055047073793 2020-10-30 23:33:53 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> Crossing my fingers and toes for my supervisor @MariaLoades 🤞🏽 she inspires me to do the best research that I can and I am so grateful to be in a position to learn from her. Good luck to all the nominees! 🌟
1321449519054233603 2020-10-28 21:51:31 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @EmmaCollis11 I felt really nervous returning too (I have OCD, so my anxiety around hygiene sky-rocketed) but now that I’ve gone a few times I’ve settled into a routine with myself. Hopefully your gym has a website with some information about the changes so you’ve got a chance to prepare 😊
1320779780791349249 2020-10-27 01:30:13 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> Home working means attending a meeting with your partner in the room off-screen and everyone looking confused when there’s a loud sneeze but no one moved 🤧😅
1320058581614460936 2020-10-25 01:44:26 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @DJROE95 This is such a mood
1319934495496327169 2020-10-24 17:31:21 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @chlo_e_b20 She’s so gorgeous 🥺
1319634950883299329 2020-10-23 21:41:04 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> Amazing webinar by @ithinkwellHugh this morning! Feeling equal parts reassured and motivated to make some changes. Time to try and get in 2 golden hours of focused work every day 💪🏽
1319323999005016066 2020-10-23 01:05:27 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @blackinthelab Amazing, thank you! Will make a note and hopefully get back to you ☺️
1319305219575087104 2020-10-22 23:50:50 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @liannabannister I’m so pleased people are enthusiastic for this! And go for it - if you want any tips or an eye to look over an application, just let me know 😊
1319206489563762688 2020-10-22 17:18:31 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @luciebd @divhealthpsych @DIMAH_UK Thank you Lucie! It’s great to know that other organisations are starting to take action in this area too 😊
1319206176698105857 2020-10-22 17:17:16 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @abbiejones86 This is really encouraging to hear! Thank you for sharing and retweeting Abbie ☺️
1319197781240721408 2020-10-22 16:43:55 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> So what does everyone think? Please retweet this as widely as possible, I really want to hear thoughts (4/4)  #AcademicChatter #AcademicTwitter #BlackAcademics #BlackLivesMatter
1319197780200574976 2020-10-22 16:43:54 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> I'm really enthusiastic about this idea but want an indication of interest. Even if interest is small, I still think it's important. If it got enough interest, I'd want to explore funding sources too because I'm tired of black people being expected to do these things free (3/4)
1319197779093299202 2020-10-22 16:43:54 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> And I'm talking about trainee doctors in every discipline - medicine, engineering, literature, psychology, history, etc. The podcasts could be fortnightly or monthly depending on interest, and could either be structured or relatively relaxed and flexible (2/4)
1319197778006953985 2020-10-22 16:43:54 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> #AcademicTwitter #BlackTwitter I want to hear your thoughts!  As a new PhD student, I want to use my platform to encourage other young black people in the UK to pursue doctorates. I'm thinking of starting a podcast, where black trainee doctors share their experiences (1/4)
1319172522768764931 2020-10-22 15:03:33 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> I’m researching (and hoping to improve) something that I went through as a kid. So probably Neville 🤓  (Also a friendly reminder that I do NOT support JKR. HP is more than its creator)
1318130428465860615 2020-10-19 18:02:38 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> Encourage any UWE Health Psych students to apply! I worked within the EDI team last year in a different intern role and it was brilliant, made a real difference to my masters experience @UWEHealthPsy
1318124859529039873 2020-10-19 17:40:30 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @annayahprosser Woo! 🥳 congrats Annayah!
1317136046434516993 2020-10-17 00:11:19 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> This event looks brilliant, I can't wait!  https://t.co/czp7A2qUUR
1316655085145993217 2020-10-15 16:20:09 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> Are PhD students also early career researchers? My gut says yes but the internet is divided 🤔  #AcademicTwitter #AcademicChatter
1316058342599557120 2020-10-14 00:48:54 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @maddi_pow This looks so interesting! Looking forward to reading it 😊
1316057710765510658 2020-10-14 00:46:24 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @annayahprosser I dread to think of it! I think that’s a brilliant idea tbh - I think there’s one run by the doctoral college, but maybe one within the psych department could be really good?
1316028851873488896 2020-10-13 22:51:43 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @chlo_e_b20 Yes please! 😂 I am that dog right now
1316028775394500617 2020-10-13 22:51:25 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @annayahprosser Thank you for the encouragement Annayah 😌 I think I’ll end up drafting something out and then seeing what happens!
1316028532401664001 2020-10-13 22:50:27 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @abbiejones86 Thank you Abbie, I will! Also I might pick your brain about NHS ethics if that’s alright (because I think you’ve done them? 👀) x
1315988634248544258 2020-10-13 20:11:54 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> Starting to draft a protocol today, and the jump from my research proposal on my PhD application to this feels huge 🤯
1315561462765678592 2020-10-12 15:54:29 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> It’s a confirmation of some people’s worst fears - that your pain won’t be taken seriously, that it’s nothing more than an “experience” indicating that you need to change your behaviours. I wish it was that simple.
1315561461259870213 2020-10-12 15:54:28 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> I would have loved to see a document that presented a holistic view of depression, coproduced with individuals with the condition. This was a fantastic opportunity to raise awareness, but I think it will have the opposite effect and make people feel less able to seek help.
1315561460072935425 2020-10-12 15:54:28 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> It reads as if depression is something that can be controlled and is a choice, which is a major oversimplification. I’m saying this not just as a researcher, but as someone who has had depression for 10 years and who can see both sides of the coin.
1315561457375948801 2020-10-12 15:54:28 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> I get that this document is supposed to be written in an “accessible” way to get people thinking of depression as more than just a medical condition, but I feel like the authors have tried so hard to provide this alternative view that they actually trivialise it.
1314568121110466560 2020-10-09 22:07:18 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @NorthcoteMatt @_SWDTP @FosteratBristol @FiSpotswood @richpulsford @profdavidevans Looks good! 😄
1314131732141150208 2020-10-08 17:13:14 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @DrS_Reynolds Thank you! 😁
1314096481792557057 2020-10-08 14:53:10 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @MariaLoades Thank you Maria 😄
1314096228007895042 2020-10-08 14:52:10 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @kevinvestig8s Thank you so much Kevin ☺️ I’ll definitely be taking some time this weekend to chill and celebrate. I hope everything is going well with your research!
1314095725802909696 2020-10-08 14:50:10 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @UWEHealthPsy Thank you Liz! I feel quite sad actually, it feels like an end of an era 😂
1314095530650337281 2020-10-08 14:49:23 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @jltil19 Thank you Jacqui! I hope you’re settling into life as a trainee clinical psychologist well 😊
1314095340920934401 2020-10-08 14:48:38 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @drnikkihayfield Thank you Nikki ☺️

1313801656807686144 2020-10-07 19:21:38 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @abbiejones86 Thank you Abbie! I haven’t read much yet and have been focusing on induction and training, but feel like reading should be taking more of a forefront 🤔
1313801473805946880 2020-10-07 19:20:55 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @Jo_Higson And I’m so proud of you 💕 look at us with MASTERS degrees
1313779697201815552 2020-10-07 17:54:23 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @DrJaneMeyrick Couldn’t have asked for a better supervisor 😊 guess we’ve got to crack on and get it published then?
1313779540473319424 2020-10-07 17:53:45 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @0404am Thank you Max 😊
1313767409791184896 2020-10-07 17:05:33 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> How many hours per week do people put aside for reading for their PhD? Starting to realise how important it will be to make time for this #AcademicTwitter #AcademicChatter
1313755098619707393 2020-10-07 16:16:38 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @Hales_Samuel Thank you! 😄

1311602570176143361 2020-10-01 17:43:15 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> #AcademicTwitter, please work your magic:  I’m a new psychology PhD student and am keen to learn about current research in child and adolescent mental health. Does anyone know of online conferences happening over this next year in this field?😁  #AcademicChatter @AcademicChatter
1311601541338595328 2020-10-01 17:39:10 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @MahmoodRaqeeb Office buds 💪🏽
1311233477199753216 2020-09-30 17:16:37 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> After a little bit of trial and error, I now have an office! 🙌🏽  https://t.co/0ZrPODYNKZ

1310622970700877826 2020-09-29 00:50:41 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> The face of someone who has finished their first day as a PhD student 🤗  https://t.co/MjOww3a9Lr
1310260360402923522 2020-09-28 00:49:48 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @byz_pd Does anyone know of any good tutorials for using Zotero?
1309789995859935233 2020-09-26 17:40:44 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @charlton_k @NorthcoteMatt Jumping in on this - I was planning to work from home for 3 days and work in the office for 2 days because my productivity at home sucks 😬 but I feel apprehensive about going in
1309126964305956872 2020-09-24 21:46:05 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @abbiejones86 Thank you Abbie, I appreciate you saying that! 😊 I’ll definitely take you up on your offer, I could use someone to go to for advice 😅
1309105652598550533 2020-09-24 20:21:24 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> Had my PhD welcome induction this morning, and it was strange going onto campus and seeing how different it is than when I was there in 2017/18. Everyone has done a fantastic job of setting everything up to be as Covid safe as possible, but still so weird 🤯
1308431730567716864 2020-09-22 23:43:28 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @EllieCowles1 Not covering your nose with a mask is like poking a hole in a condom
1308071204096552962 2020-09-21 23:50:52 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> After 7 years, I’m finally saying goodbye to my old laptop and welcoming my new one! My laptop has seen me through my A Levels, undergraduate degree and my masters, but I didn’t think it could cope with a PhD too 😬  https://t.co/KYQW7PEtax
1308035432538660864 2020-09-21 21:28:43 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @SciGunn Congrats Dr Gunn! 🥳

1307980334810771456 2020-09-21 17:49:47 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> Hi, I’m Nina 👋🏽 I have a BSc in Psychology, have just finished my MSc in Health Psychology, and am about to start a PhD exploring fatigue in adolescent depression 😴 I’m #BlackInMH because of my research, my work for mental health charities, and my lived experience #BIMHRollCall  https://t.co/cYdUuleu4p

1306615135646216192 2020-09-17 23:24:58 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> If you’d told me at the start of my undergrad degree that in 5 years time I’d be helping with teaching and marking at undergrad level, I wouldn’t have believed you 😅 excited to get started, share some knowledge, and help others get the most out of their psychology degree
1305880684867747841 2020-09-15 22:46:32 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> @JadeSouthron Doing pretty well to only have 99 breakdowns through all of that 😉 so proud of you, you absolutely smashed it!!! Now go and relax 💕
1304094153547153409 2020-09-11 00:27:29 +0800 <n_higsonsweeney> Well deserved 👏🏽
