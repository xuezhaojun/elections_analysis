1341749315476307969 2020-12-23 22:15:39 +0800 <robertsondcang1> @IsabelOakeshott @NicolaSturgeon You have no idea what life has become living under the SNP.Fake history and propaganda being fed to our kids through the education system, vile sex education peddled  in schools,boycott of non-SNP supporting businesses. We are depressed and demoralised. Our country is ruined.
1341130022225121280 2020-12-22 05:14:48 +0800 <robertsondcang1> @toryboypierce @BorisJohnson @NicolaSturgeon We are all sick of her here in Scotland. She depresses the hell out of us. Instead of pontificating on her platform, she should be doing the job she gets paid more than Boris for. Worst drug deaths in Europe,15000 businesses waiting for Covid grants. List of failures is endless.

1338601484347387904 2020-12-15 05:47:18 +0800 <robertsondcang1> @blondiesup Yes, she tends to have that effect on you and I used to be such a mild-mannered person!
1335695817231962113 2020-12-07 05:21:13 +0800 <robertsondcang1> @kmacbean123 NO! Nationalism is destructive.

1334635543473303559 2020-12-04 07:08:04 +0800 <robertsondcang1> @scotfax Toe-curling stuff. I am mortified for him but more so for the people of Scotland!

1330993503439097857 2020-11-24 05:55:54 +0800 <robertsondcang1> @ChaplinLorra @queentilli @Ianblackford_MP I agree. A large part of the UK are oblivious to the Nationalists' vile behaviour and that includes many Scots!
1330970905367994371 2020-11-24 04:26:06 +0800 <robertsondcang1> @ChaplinLorra @queentilli @Ianblackford_MP He publicly called out a photographer on Twitter for travelling to the North of Scotland from England during lockdown to take a photo of the borealis. Turns out photographer lives in Scotland now! Blackford has since deleted his tweet and made an apology "of sorts".

1321911525339205632 2020-10-30 04:27:22 +0800 <robertsondcang1> @mummylion_36 @Brackens1 Wouldn't put anything past them!
1317511910217101314 2020-10-18 01:04:52 +0800 <robertsondcang1> @RupertMyers @bbcnickrobinson The highlight so far of a hellish year! More of this please!
