The Senate is still at 48-48, and after the two Georgia runoff elections, it could be 52 - 48 against (future former Senate majority leader) McConnell, leaving him with NO POWER to affect the confirmations.

1321473749967753216 2020-10-28 23:27:48 +0800 <DanJBalkwill> @WizConservative @Mikel_Jollett States are SUPPOSED to follow that law.

1303762233004969984 2020-09-10 02:28:33 +0800 <DanJBalkwill> @RoArquette The nomination process allows any government official to nominate anyone. Trump has now been nominated twice (2018 and 2020) by an ultra-right wing Norwegian official. Maybe whatever Norwegian citizens that voted for that official could be blamed.
