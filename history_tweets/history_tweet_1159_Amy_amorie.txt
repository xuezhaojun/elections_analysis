1342999660089274368 2020-12-27 09:04:05 +0800 <Amy_amorie> I was raised to accept everyone, to be kind, empathetic &amp; accepting of others &amp; I lived by that.

Maybe we could make one ourselves that tells the true story. The urgency of building our own communities and working for white wellbeing is  becoming clearer the more I understand.

1338777256014045186 2020-12-15 17:25:45 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @JohnsonBullion For the sake of the argument: it will eventually be African, whites will no longer exist but mass immigration from black countries will continue, all 'mixed' people will continue  to reproduce with blacks thus ever reducing the white mix .. white erasure.
1338775867229519873 2020-12-15 17:20:14 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @JohnsonBullion I would say that your hypothesis of his meaning is based more on your penchant for using miscegenation to insult white people than any real interpretation.. given the content of your feed.

To say it doesn't matter if an entire race of people ceases to exist and then imply it would be a positive!  It appears BLM but not white lives. Please explain how you think this is acceptable?
1338627846210633728 2020-12-15 07:32:03 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BarryNiet @Europinion_ It is seductive and also insidious as its packaged as good, promoting love and tolerance manipulating good people into following it who genuinely believe they are on the right side.

1335515503339646977 2020-12-06 17:24:43 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @thisislaurat This has an even greater effect when the harm is shown to affect one of the protected categories, race, gender, religion etc. MP's, corporations &amp; the media will be falling over themselves to score points. This protection of course doesnt extend to white people only  harm them.
1335513796421570570 2020-12-06 17:17:56 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @thisislaurat I see it as manipulation of good intention. Theres a group or opinion you want to remove, label it in the negative, escalate that negative to harmful/heinous through 'virtuous' groups hope not hate etc and MSM, then pass laws to silence said group good has been done.. right? ü§îüôÉ

1335508149776896000 2020-12-06 16:55:30 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @thisislaurat .. to beat the state we need to have the support of the masses so it's a battle for hearts &amp; minds, we need to rekindle the love for who we are  as an antidote for the poison we've been fed for so long. We do that through community and rejoining in wholesome ways. IMO of course‚ù§
1335506922204782592 2020-12-06 16:50:37 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @thisislaurat I have been looking at Patriotic Alternative after I followed Laura theres lots of information on the site, I may even try Laura's tea! :) Building our community and connecting is the key to turning this around i believe so its something I could get behind and support..

It wouldn't end well :(

Using violence will just give them all the propaganda they need to disenfranchise us completely &amp; outlaw any &amp; all narrative against this madness
1335158577850413057 2020-12-05 17:46:25 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BrigantiaRegina Handsome gentleman!

I intend to have a family and I want my children to have a bright and happy future not be part of a subjugated hated minority who are treated as a sub-class or worse.

They are calling for literal genocide. I can scarcely take this in.
1335032638080430080 2020-12-05 09:25:59 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @Prime_Time_100 @mojogringo I understand, twitter is a toxic forum and you are defending your position and your people I'm part of that so without wishing to appearing conceited you're defending me .. thank you :)

I was living happy in a world of rainbows and sunshine but I noticed a crack and when I slipped though I was in a nightmare but it's real.. I now understand the red pill blue pill thing!
1335016218399559680 2020-12-05 08:20:44 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @Prime_Time_100 @mojogringo I agree and I'm ashamed to admit I'm frightened, if this trend doesnt change the future looks very bleak and one i do not want to see come to fruition. We need to come together, a united people again and speak up for ourselves instead of advocating for our own demise.

We need to keep opening peoples eyes and building back OUR communities teach people it's not a crime or hate to live you're own and get them onside
1335013178598711297 2020-12-05 08:08:39 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Europinion_ @Prime_Time_100 @mojogringo To do anything which allows them to paint us in a negative light.

What's worse is how they get a free pass from the state who turn a blind eye while the media spin it. Which is why we can't afford ..
1335010840685244416 2020-12-05 07:59:22 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Norny666 @leastimnotu I shall take a look .. thank you üå∫

I'm not suggesting that we now down and just accept it not ever! We just have to be smart about it.
1335007315762819080 2020-12-05 07:45:21 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Norny666 @leastimnotu Yes, if I recall my history did the Male children not have to leave their village at around 8 or 9 and survive in the wilderness and if they returned after killing a wolf or something they were then a man?

I'm not being confrontational I just see violence as giving them everything they need to completely outlaw any resistance to the this insanity that I've been woken up too.

You cannot fight an overwhelming force with brute strength.

It seems there's extremism on both sides and one is simply the flip side of the other. Perhaps the balance lies in the centre.

Not only does it often pass on morality and life lessons but also gives us an insight into our ancestors, a bridge through time allowing us a greater connection to our ancestry.

These articles are hateful and divisive far worse than the leaflet yet they stand as promotions of virtue. This flies in the face of what I believe &amp; in all good conscience I cant defend this.

I feel that anyone has the freedom to have children with whomever they like. Your statement wasn't supremacist unless your meaning was white people should only have white children because they are superior. I'm sorry you experienced that.

I can't say I've noticed a daily regime of hatred against white people in the media nor films I also have no idea of who would be behind such a programme.

1327661752419553282 2020-11-15 01:16:43 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @amk262 @boblister_poole @lizzywales You cannot blame modern industrialisation and economics on western colonisation it's far more complex then that. preserving the environment and ecology is a human issue and we must come together to solve it. It is unhelpful to turn it into a  a racial issue.
1327655149981020163 2020-11-15 00:50:29 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ While I see your point on indigenous citizens benefiting more from the systems of their nation I don't think it's fair. Everyone should be treated equally if they have paid into the system. It's wrong to treat people differently based on race, sexuality, or religion etc.

I'm sorry she experienced that!
1327621549613068292 2020-11-14 22:36:58 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ It depends what you mean by most important. If you mean they should remain the majority I actually kind of agree there but if you mean they should be treated better or receive preferential treatment then no as we are all people.

We must keep channels open to everyone if we are going to resolve these problems. Hatred is not the way.
1327596817840652291 2020-11-14 20:58:41 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BritannicBysta1 @MikeStuchbery_ I have and lots were abusive .. while I while I appreciate this is a sensitive issue I find it much more helpful and conducive to debate if people remain polite‚ù§
1327595041452404736 2020-11-14 20:51:38 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ I would say you have been very respectful and open! I don't know why Mike would have chosen to hide your replies .. are you sure it may just be another Twitter glitch?
1327594324767469568 2020-11-14 20:48:47 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @BritannicBysta1 @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ I do believe it was heavy handed policing to arrest him .. poor thing must have been terrified, do you know what he was actually arrested for?
1327593699195428864 2020-11-14 20:46:18 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ We certainly have common ground on our distaste for global finance and economic power. So, if our population is in decline but bringing in more people allegedly leads to the erosion of the ethnic English what is the answer?
1327587087672102912 2020-11-14 20:20:01 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @basedhp @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ Thank you Howard. That is interesting reading those figures are a lot higher than I was expecting. That's not say I agree with the sentiments of the leaflets or Patriotic Alternative. However if they are facts they have a right to Express them maybe just worded differently üôÇ
1327585051081646080 2020-11-14 20:11:56 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ Firstly, thank you for your calm demeanor and not screaming snowflake leftie at me! But surely population growth must include  everyone not just immigrants, also having other cultures here doesn't erase or lessen our own.
1327578116898877442 2020-11-14 19:44:22 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ Even if true I do believe its divisive and even inciteful. It directly blames such things as traffic congestion and NHS waiting lists on immigration when these are complicated issues with multiple reasons. May I ask why you feel having other cultures here a bad thing?
1327570831682232320 2020-11-14 19:15:26 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ I have to disagree that it's not controversial, however I'm surprised  it does appear to be accurate statistically though i will look more into this. While I don't agree with the sentiment I don't see a reason it shouldn't be allowed and I think being arrested for it is wrong.
1327563821121146880 2020-11-14 18:47:34 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Mrkrinkle11 @MikeStuchbery_ Thank you MrKrinkle. Whilst I wouldn't want this put through my door I personally think its divisive. More to the point is it even accurate?
1327562244931153920 2020-11-14 18:41:18 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @leastimnotu @boblister_poole A heartfelt, emotive video from this man and I echo a lot of his sentiments. The corporate machine cares nothing for the spirit of the planet or our need to be connected to it. Their driving force is financial gain and economic growth but to what end!?üòî Thank you for posting ‚ù§
1327558643429105664 2020-11-14 18:27:00 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @amk262 @boblister_poole @lizzywales Mr Khan, with respect the loss of our environment and ancient sites is an issue we ALL need to support. Racially divisive language will only hinder our efforts at cohesive activism I'm sure you will agree üôÇ

1327549924679028736 2020-11-14 17:52:21 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @MikeStuchbery_ Hello Mike :)  If these leaflets did contain racially hateful material then I agree it should be stopped. But I feel open debate is a better medium to stop radicalisation as opposed to gagging IMO. Does anyone have a link to or copy of said leaflets?
1327255644240482305 2020-11-13 22:22:59 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @DaveZ_uk Oh York is beautiful isn't! I have been several times. The shambles is just so quaint and well, English ‚ù§
1327151921963159553 2020-11-13 15:30:50 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @Tyr_7777 Oh this is so very sad. All the time financial gain is the driving force for humankind then the importance of deeper things like human rights and the environment will always come second :(..
1327148397120413696 2020-11-13 15:16:49 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @boblister_poole Omg this is so very heartbreaking. This was more than just a tree it was a monument. So sad and wrongüò≠
1326612907052978179 2020-11-12 03:48:58 +0800 <Amy_amorie> @thewhitebfly This is great! But surely anyone can care for the land the more helping the better yes? üôÇ
