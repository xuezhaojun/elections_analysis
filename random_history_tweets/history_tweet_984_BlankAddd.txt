Then 300 ended after 2 months.  Still people list the checks and never mention the unemployment as part of the stimulus.  This country spent way more then any other country by far

1341554008830267392 2020-12-23 09:19:35 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC I mean it‚Äôs so easy cause of course the American people want money and don‚Äôt want it sent to all these countries and special interest.  But the Congress is just so corrupt.  They have to balance the political appetite and them getting rich off backroom deals.

1341199310663241728 2020-12-22 09:50:08 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC Fed government isn‚Äôt supposed to be doing all this anyways.  It‚Äôs like the EU making blanket laws for all the countries.  Insane.  The fed was created for defense and to facilitate trade.  That‚Äôs it!  States should be making the laws and taxing.
1341192767565750272 2020-12-22 09:24:08 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC Corporations can‚Äôt use force.  Governments can use force.  Switzerland a great government.  That‚Äôs a model to follow
1341191015449784322 2020-12-22 09:17:10 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC Switzerland has the best government IMO.  They do it right.  That‚Äôs a model to follow
1341190867197968384 2020-12-22 09:16:35 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC Haha that‚Äôs what every socialist has ever said.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just THIS government is evil.‚Äù  Government is an inherently evil institution and should be as limited and small as possible.  The 20th century proved that and believing otherwise is akin to flat earthism at this point.
1341189900012462080 2020-12-22 09:12:44 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC I guess it‚Äôs not exactly a knock on socialism(government owning the means of production) but it‚Äôs definitely a knock on government and therefore a reason not to have socialism...Why would you want the government to run everything?
1341189584860790787 2020-12-22 09:11:29 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC Government spending and rules is a form of socialism.  Telling bussinesses they can‚Äôt operate is the governments fault.  Not capitalism.  Government bailouts of the rich etc etc and giving pennies to the poor.  That has nothing to do with capitalism.
1341180528066613248 2020-12-22 08:35:30 +0800 <BlankAddd> @HayaBusta @KyleKulinski Ya so you two are employees.  You‚Äôd till get money.  I know people where it was just one person and they got money

1341175896783212544 2020-12-22 08:17:06 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC The government shutting bussinesses down and then handing out pennies has nothing to Do with a capitalist system...

1339571597384896512 2020-12-17 22:02:11 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC Lol $600 is a such a joke when they are doling out trillions.  Trump should go full scored earth.  He should call publicly for $25k checks to all Americans.  Pardon Assange Snowden Veto NDAA patriot act.  Call for Antifa and proud boys to unite against chuck and Nancy etc etc
1339515812944748545 2020-12-17 18:20:31 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC Ya it‚Äôs not severe for most people
1339515384802603010 2020-12-17 18:18:49 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC If you vaccinated the entire planet you would only have 1/10nth the cases then if you didn‚Äôt.  Well maybe 1/9th cause 10% probably already had it
1339495447090528257 2020-12-17 16:59:35 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC I mean does*
1339495381625794560 2020-12-17 16:59:20 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC Ya mandatory is bs.  But 8 cases out of 20,000 instead of 86 is a big deal.  It doesn‚Äôt reduce the cases by 90%
1339471572797571077 2020-12-17 15:24:43 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC 8/86 is 93%.  So you should basically get around 93% less cases.  Their number is is weird.  But ya eveyone having to get side effects kinda sucks.
1339469171382476801 2020-12-17 15:15:11 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC It reduced 86 cases to 8 cases.  It‚Äôs still kinda like 90%.  Vaccine will divide total world cases ever by 10 basically
1339403661928136706 2020-12-17 10:54:52 +0800 <BlankAddd> @RaoulGMI Lol you must have never been through any of the previous BTC bubbles before.  You can stream youtube watching the price go up and you will get thousands of subscribers right now

Because he is the co-founder of Ethereum and this is pretty much worthless if you don‚Äôt get his input.  Also the fork to Ethereum classic.  Does it touch on that?  That was a big deal.

1333182137592209408 2020-11-30 06:52:45 +0800 <BlankAddd> @808constituent @cameron8digi There is video evidence.  We don‚Äôt need theories....
1333180701122863104 2020-11-30 06:47:03 +0800 <BlankAddd> @808constituent @cameron8digi He was chased before he shot the first person.  Did you know that?  He was being chased by 5-10 people one of which shot a gun in the air while chasing him before he shot anyone.  He then turned around and and was lunged at by a guy and he shot him.  That was the first one.
1333178041598578689 2020-11-30 06:36:29 +0800 <BlankAddd> @808constituent @cameron8digi They weren‚Äôt being chased by mobs with guns
1333176277373657088 2020-11-30 06:29:28 +0800 <BlankAddd> @808constituent @cameron8digi Sure but he shouldn‚Äôt be called a mass shooter.  You don‚Äôt realize that?  It‚Äôs literally propaganda level language.  Ya I don‚Äôt agree with playing vigilante hero etc etc but that‚Äôs not the point.
1333174808465469441 2020-11-30 06:23:38 +0800 <BlankAddd> @cameron8digi @808constituent Yes it was clearly self defense
1333174645944586241 2020-11-30 06:22:59 +0800 <BlankAddd> @808constituent @cameron8digi Just because you do something illegal( carry under age bring gun across state etc etc) doesn‚Äôt make your self defense a mass shooter.  That‚Äôs propaganda leavel smears.  Same things intelligence agencies do to Assange and stuff.  Language wars
1333172952607510528 2020-11-30 06:16:15 +0800 <BlankAddd> @808constituent @cameron8digi Ya because he‚Äôs being persecuted for self defense.  People should stand up for him and I‚Äôm no maga person
1333171903834378241 2020-11-30 06:12:05 +0800 <BlankAddd> @808constituent @cameron8digi Antifa was celebrating it right after.  Republicans don‚Äôt celebrate mass shooters.  Antifa calls Teump supporters Nazis so that it makes ok for them to be killed.  Nothing wrong with killing a Nazi right?
1333109923199078400 2020-11-30 02:05:48 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC Their police also don‚Äôt have guns lol

1332860370361303040 2020-11-29 09:34:10 +0800 <BlankAddd> Honestly I think this is a big opportunity.  Any stop the steal or MAGA people need go down and join these BLM protestors in front of @ericgarcetti house.  Fight the police with them.  Anti lockdown and BLM should join together at this moment in time.  Fight about culture after

1330974933615136768 2020-11-24 04:42:07 +0800 <BlankAddd> @caitoz Electoral system is fine.  You must not understand the history of state sovereignty.  It would be like a popular vote in all the European nations combined to elect EU leadership to do it differently.  The problem is the fed shouldn‚Äôt have soo much control of the states

1330325657423933442 2020-11-22 09:42:07 +0800 <BlankAddd> This really does sum it up. Betting odds at this point also had trump priced at -910 to win meaning he was over 90% to win.

1324896574032338944 2020-11-07 10:08:53 +0800 <BlankAddd> @aaronjmate Biden didn‚Äôt win yet.  Stop with the spook propaganda.  You more then anyone should know how dangerous parroting intelligence talking points can be.
1324895348792328198 2020-11-07 10:04:01 +0800 <BlankAddd> @BretWeinstein Do more people get bombed under this administration or Trumps.  I say Biden‚Äôs (intelligence agencies basically).

1324850377167044608 2020-11-07 07:05:19 +0800 <BlankAddd> @JesseBWatters You need to call out the coup
1324837912349798401 2020-11-07 06:15:47 +0800 <BlankAddd> @joelockhart Dead people voting is evidence
1324837105298628608 2020-11-07 06:12:34 +0800 <BlankAddd> @Wizard_Predicts They are trying to make the coup legitimate.  ‚ÄúWe did all we could fairly.‚Äù

1324798731347087360 2020-11-07 03:40:05 +0800 <BlankAddd> @senat0rvillegas Their grift is up yes.  Now they can just be operatives or bagmen or whatever for the neocon deep state.  Rubin will continue to be a propagandist.
1324798189799497728 2020-11-07 03:37:56 +0800 <BlankAddd> @caitoz Oh and they were already stacking the pentagon with the right people.
1324797836169412608 2020-11-07 03:36:32 +0800 <BlankAddd> @caitoz This was an intelligence and neocon coup.  This administration will be run by the intelligence agencies.  I just hope they don‚Äôt destroy too many countries.  They are pent up after 4 years.
1324797305975963653 2020-11-07 03:34:25 +0800 <BlankAddd> @senat0rvillegas Rubin and the Lincoln Project did their job.  They will be rewarded for that

1324780577304711168 2020-11-07 02:27:57 +0800 <BlankAddd> @ImaCruzn @killa_cam214 True.  The crackdown on social media will start first.  And if anyone takes to the streets then the ‚Äúwhite supremacist terrorist‚Äù will be dealt with swiftly and forcefully.
1324778397470371840 2020-11-07 02:19:17 +0800 <BlankAddd> @killa_cam214 The intelligence agencies and the neocons pulled off this coup.  The will have full control in this administration.  Socialist will have no power.  I just hope they don‚Äôt bomb and massacre too many brown people overseas
1324775656601743360 2020-11-07 02:08:24 +0800 <BlankAddd> @gummibear737 Statistical anomalies are proof.  Every state and county except for 7 finished their election on time.  Trump over performs.  In those 7 cities you have massive overperfomance by Biden that doesn‚Äôt match anywhere else in the country.. The coup is so obvious

1324570839065391104 2020-11-06 12:34:32 +0800 <BlankAddd> @DraftTulsi It‚Äôs all making sense now.  They played the socialist like a fiddle.  Bernie and Trump should have joined forces.  Instead they got them to hate each other.
1324568433875279873 2020-11-06 12:24:58 +0800 <BlankAddd> @DraftTulsi Yep and they rigged an election.  Disgusting.  Neocons are back in charge.  Biden and Harris are basically irrelevant.  Intelligence is running things now.  Just hope they don‚Äôt bomb and massacre too many brown children.

1324554603124305921 2020-11-06 11:30:01 +0800 <BlankAddd> @mtracey You don‚Äôt get it. This is the establishment taking the reigns of power back.  This is an intelligence coup.  After the media announces Biden winning tommorrow there will be a full court press to get Trump to give up.  And eventually Some GOP senators will join in.
1324551793875955713 2020-11-06 11:18:51 +0800 <BlankAddd> @yopasta Trump was going to win in a landslide and the intelligence agencies still pulled off this coup easily.  Scary.

1324502687023390720 2020-11-06 08:03:43 +0800 <BlankAddd> @DougPolkVids Maybe cause fraud everywhere
1324501977615589377 2020-11-06 08:00:54 +0800 <BlankAddd> @BretWeinstein You are so wrong on this.  Obviously fraud.  Open your eyes.

1324495290640998400 2020-11-06 07:34:19 +0800 <BlankAddd> @RyanMeese @DougPolkVids Because they are doing it hastily and sloppily.  Everyone can see the obvious fraud with just a high school level knowledge of statistics.
1324495015167451136 2020-11-06 07:33:14 +0800 <BlankAddd> @DougPolkVids I thought poker players were good at statistics.  92% Turnout in WI.  Average election is 50%.  This election nationally.  74%.  Also 6 figure ballot dumps of 100% Biden.  Also he overperformed 2016 in every state where ballots were counted on time.

But Trump Barry loses by a razor thin margin in PA or something you are hardly vindicated.  In fact the data crunchers you have been talking shit to would still be more correct

1316115934864498688 2020-10-14 04:37:45 +0800 <BlankAddd> @HumanistReport That‚Äôs not court packing lol.  You can say it‚Äôs bad or whatever but it‚Äôs not expanding the court beyond 9 justices.  That‚Äôs a different thing.  Why do liberals have to change the definition of words.  Is their vocabulary that bad?
1316114741706678272 2020-10-14 04:33:01 +0800 <BlankAddd> @Hindsworth1 @mtracey They literally got arrested for chatting about hypothetical situations.  That‚Äôs insane

1315104871582842880 2020-10-11 09:40:09 +0800 <BlankAddd> Antifa are just killing conservatives now.  If you are on the left you have a responsibility to speak up.

In a free market the oil companies would go bankrupt if managed badly and more competent people who could manage them correctly would buy them out.  Or the bad management would get fired early.  Can‚Äôt you see how those market checks are missing?

1314447897509859328 2020-10-09 14:09:34 +0800 <BlankAddd> @gummibear737 @Brentwoody11 The fact that there is 114 red leans vs only 46 blue leans would mean Biden is still a decent favorite.  Say leans are all 60/40..
1314437838222417920 2020-10-09 13:29:36 +0800 <BlankAddd> @808constituent They were already an oil rich country.  But they were literally the richest country in South America before Chavez.

1314437452170366978 2020-10-09 13:28:04 +0800 <BlankAddd> @808constituent The first sanctions we enacted in 2014. Venezuela was already going through a complete collapse caused by Chavez by 2010. Hyperinflation, starvation, protests and chaos in the streets.Then the regimes became more authoritarian to control that and we put sanctions making it worse

And this was 2 months ago. You don‚Äôt know what you are talking about.

1313336600412053504 2020-10-06 12:33:40 +0800 <BlankAddd> @KyleKulinski @JoeBiden They will vote for him anyways.  The left is the most pathetic voting bloc in modern history and that‚Äôs why nobody gives a shit about them.  They will never vote for Trump and everyone knows it including Biden.

All they do is get shit on by them no matter what while the candidate cheats primaries and panders to republicans.  But the truth is the 99% of the left vote democrat.  Maybe 1% vote green.  0% vote gop.  They take your votes for granted

1311583456896270336 2020-10-01 16:27:18 +0800 <BlankAddd> @RobByrneDC Of course he did.  Do you morons not understand how this works?  The left is going to vote for Biden anyways.  So he can cheat them and shit on them all he wants.  He‚Äôs trying to get republicans and independents.  He doesn‚Äôt respect the left because they will already vote for him
1311576699738353665 2020-10-01 16:00:27 +0800 <BlankAddd> @808constituent Trump saying stand ‚Äúby‚Äù was completely irresponsible and idiotic.  But TBH that‚Äôs the diversion. The bigger picture is the left not calling out the radical left for 4 months now! And now the right will follow suite.  It‚Äôs possible trump just bumbled and doesn‚Äôt know who they are
1311573301077049344 2020-10-01 15:46:57 +0800 <BlankAddd> @808constituent What‚Äôs swelling numbers is the left not calling out Antifa and the radical left.  Now as a counteraction the right will be less likely to call out their radical elements and so on and on.  The obvious feedback loop.  Jordan Peterson warns exactly this.   https://t.co/XdVYnm6d3N
1311570078966530048 2020-10-01 15:34:09 +0800 <BlankAddd> @808constituent Trump probably doesn‚Äôt even who they are.  Proud boys are like 40 incels up in Oregon that use to fight with Antifa before Antifa got big.  This is so stupid.

He can cheat and suck up to republicans all he wants because he knows the left will never vote for Trump.  That‚Äôs the problem with being an ideologue.  You get fucked

Stop being dumb
1310248681795330051 2020-09-28 00:03:23 +0800 <BlankAddd> @HumanistReport So your point is they can shame your mom and she will still vote for Biden....Why would they ever stop?  They have your votes anyways

1307709380452728832 2020-09-20 23:53:07 +0800 <BlankAddd> @gelliottmorris States are sovereign.  You don‚Äôt like our constitution?  Popular vote has zero importance.  You sound like an idiot bringing it up or using it as a metric for anything that‚Äôs ‚Äúfair‚Äù
1307707906058452992 2020-09-20 23:47:15 +0800 <BlankAddd> @Thunda_munk @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump He would literally lose for sure if he didn‚Äôt confirm lol...
1307706538832793601 2020-09-20 23:41:49 +0800 <BlankAddd> @washingtonpost Then the GOP can just pack 20 judges next time....
1307636825326985216 2020-09-20 19:04:48 +0800 <BlankAddd> @AbbyMartin Fighting who?
1307625051005411328 2020-09-20 18:18:01 +0800 <BlankAddd> @Thunda_munk @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump How are you so bad at politics.  His state is super red.  If he didn‚Äôt confirm all the republicans would bail on him and he would lose.  If he confirms then they all back him and he wins.  Why should he give a fuck about the dems.  The literally aren‚Äôt enough in his state.
1307599991884587010 2020-09-20 16:38:26 +0800 <BlankAddd> @KittyLists lol she hated that shit.  https://t.co/dVyV2UQVXP
1307599578720477185 2020-09-20 16:36:48 +0800 <BlankAddd> @ellencarmichael Exactly.  We aren‚Äôt supposed to care.  But we do because the federal government has soo much power now and everyone can feel it.
1307599098749399042 2020-09-20 16:34:53 +0800 <BlankAddd> @RonPlacone But progressives want to give these people more power?
1307554399921696769 2020-09-20 13:37:16 +0800 <BlankAddd> What is @thehill up to?
1307552973833121793 2020-09-20 13:31:36 +0800 <BlankAddd> @raesanni You are still voting dem?  POC have been moving towards Trump is droves.  Get with the times
1307551188452167681 2020-09-20 13:24:31 +0800 <BlankAddd> @ggreenwald @WajahatAli You are allowed to call republicans faggots.  You didn‚Äôt know that?  It‚Äôs only oppressive when targeting democrats
1307546620779585537 2020-09-20 13:06:22 +0800 <BlankAddd> @JillFilipovic A lawyer is saying anyone who didn‚Äôt vote for Hillary Clinton is going to Hell.  Save this tweet on the off chance you face her in trial.

1307496976292823040 2020-09-20 09:49:05 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC It‚Äôs possible she was legit racist
1307496223671156736 2020-09-20 09:46:06 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC Gop was for sending aid during pandemic.  Just not bailing out the state governments.  Dems wouldn‚Äôt do the deal unless states got money.  That‚Äôs why Trump had to sign the executive order to give the extra $400 and stop evictions and what not.

1307447164293980161 2020-09-20 06:31:09 +0800 <BlankAddd> @salemlawyer @JeffreyToobin @NewYorker Then gop just adds 20 next time.  Stop being dumb.
1307446982554783744 2020-09-20 06:30:26 +0800 <BlankAddd> @DrDiamondGurl @JeffreyToobin @NewYorker They could also just add 10 judges next time.  Split Texas in 3 states for 6 senators etc etc.  we don‚Äôt wanna go down this feedback loop path
1307446714932973568 2020-09-20 06:29:22 +0800 <BlankAddd> @subrettt @DrWutt @JeffreyToobin @NewYorker No he didn‚Äôt
1307446607655256064 2020-09-20 06:28:57 +0800 <BlankAddd> @RealJeffanator @JeffreyToobin @NewYorker So short sighted.  Then gop just adds 100 judges next time.  System would implode.
1307446323415666688 2020-09-20 06:27:49 +0800 <BlankAddd> @denisewu @JeffreyToobin @NewYorker Split Texas in 3!  You idiots don‚Äôt understand foodback loops

1307443846041624576 2020-09-20 06:17:58 +0800 <BlankAddd> @fostymama @mattklewis @Jennmc55 There is no rule
1307439379044954112 2020-09-20 06:00:13 +0800 <BlankAddd> @marklevinshow So they are just letting the democrats extort them?  They could just pull out the pack the court stuff whenever they want something then.  They can‚Äôt let them do that.
1307438275913687041 2020-09-20 05:55:50 +0800 <BlankAddd> Would you really preemptively drop an atomic bomb on the Republicans?
1307437174694969344 2020-09-20 05:51:28 +0800 <BlankAddd> @SenBlumenthal So your going to preemptively Nuke the Republicans?
1307436008573513729 2020-09-20 05:46:50 +0800 <BlankAddd> @fleccas I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad and I hate Antifa
1307435677634584577 2020-09-20 05:45:31 +0800 <BlankAddd> @808constituent Remember when everyone was screaming about not abandoning the Kurds...

1307424797899419649 2020-09-20 05:02:17 +0800 <BlankAddd> @curablefury You probably like ketchup on your pizza
1307424047026696192 2020-09-20 04:59:18 +0800 <BlankAddd> @ggreenwald Graham would get crushed if voted Not to confirm.  That‚Äôs easy.  Collins I‚Äôm not sure.  I don‚Äôt see how any republicans would vote for her if she didn‚Äôt vote to confirm but maybe she picks up a bunch of dems?
1307412873379942400 2020-09-20 04:14:54 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC I would say tax cuts are the only difference there.  Other stuff would happen under both parties.  And spending is still the same so tax cuts don‚Äôt even really matter cause they just print the money which is an ‚Äúinflation tax.‚Äù
1307412071449899008 2020-09-20 04:11:43 +0800 <BlankAddd> @hrtablaze Her voice is terrible.  Probably pick someone else
1307409969122140160 2020-09-20 04:03:21 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC Both parties are very similar.  What has team red really got.  I can argue team blue has had more their policies passed over the last 40 years or whatever
1307409463763021824 2020-09-20 04:01:21 +0800 <BlankAddd> @DonovanFarley Nobody believes your threats anymore
1307406374167429120 2020-09-20 03:49:04 +0800 <BlankAddd> @nedryun I honestly don‚Äôt see how Romney can vote against.
1307406200745517056 2020-09-20 03:48:23 +0800 <BlankAddd> @stillgray Clarence Thomas should just have a dying wish ‚Äúthat a Republican President pick my replacement.‚Äù  Like it‚Äôs so stupid.
1307403297658204171 2020-09-20 03:36:51 +0800 <BlankAddd> @RealCandaceO They will just add more judges...Don‚Äôt underestimate Marxists
1307401176673996800 2020-09-20 03:28:25 +0800 <BlankAddd> @atrupar Hahah WTF are you talking about.
1307394012806959104 2020-09-20 02:59:57 +0800 <BlankAddd> @chrislhayes Stop ruining the word ‚Äúfascist.‚Äù
1307387611665715200 2020-09-20 02:34:31 +0800 <BlankAddd> @NYCAntifa Your tactics are getting too stupid.  Go back to the mom wall thing.  That seemed to work best
1307387175843979264 2020-09-20 02:32:47 +0800 <BlankAddd> @megynkelly Mitch said opposite parties...
1307384385541349376 2020-09-20 02:21:42 +0800 <BlankAddd> @NateSilver538 Adding seats is so stupid.  Next time gop gets prez and senate why don‚Äôt they just add 100 seats. That talk has to hurt them with independents.  Also just because gop has an advantage doesn‚Äôt mean you change it.  ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we just split Texas in 3 states.‚Äù  That‚Äôs how you sound.
1307383296905474048 2020-09-20 02:17:22 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC States are sovereign.  The federal government isn‚Äôt supposed to be so big.  Supposed to be more like the EU but with an army.  The popular vote talk is stupid.  States are supposed to be sovereign.
1307310768807837700 2020-09-19 21:29:10 +0800 <BlankAddd> @Tedpinson @DraftTulsi Yes he‚Äôs not good.  But I don‚Äôt think him and Biden are equal.  Biden is just a shell and Neocons are behind for a reason.  And they are viscously going after Trump for a reason.
1307309401779261441 2020-09-19 21:23:44 +0800 <BlankAddd> @Tedpinson @DraftTulsi Ya he‚Äôs not good by my standards but better then the last 4 presidents for sure.  You can‚Äôt see that the Neocons hate him?  Lincoln Project.  The Atlantic.  All the old Bush/Cheney operatives are backing Biden.
1307306696339939329 2020-09-19 21:12:59 +0800 <BlankAddd> @Autarkh @danielsgoldman @TrinityResists Fuck that.  500 justices minimum!n don‚Äôt let them ever catch up!
1307305241667203073 2020-09-19 21:07:12 +0800 <BlankAddd> @Tedpinson @DraftTulsi Neocons are all backing Biden and hate Trump.

1307302765983539202 2020-09-19 20:57:22 +0800 <BlankAddd> @Tedpinson @DraftTulsi An argument for murdering more brown people?

1307258711069487104 2020-09-19 18:02:19 +0800 <BlankAddd> @gummibear737 @marklevinshow And Graham
1307176566279958528 2020-09-19 12:35:54 +0800 <BlankAddd> @NateSilver538 Wow you finally endorsed a political party.  Very unprofessional
1307162829145874432 2020-09-19 11:41:19 +0800 <BlankAddd> @alexsalvinews I bet grassley votes to confirm
1307162073554591745 2020-09-19 11:38:18 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PetiteNicoco Ya it‚Äôs weird.  Emotional instability?
1307157695326121984 2020-09-19 11:20:55 +0800 <BlankAddd> Beautiful cinematography.  Oscar for best score also.
1307157383974547456 2020-09-19 11:19:40 +0800 <BlankAddd> @BeauWillimon Please don‚Äôt.  You are scaring my children
1307156774823239680 2020-09-19 11:17:15 +0800 <BlankAddd> @808constituent Ya he‚Äôs playing it right.  Like I‚Äôm not sure how much empathy Trump actually has but at least he‚Äôs not talking about it the seat should be filled yet.  At least wait a day.  Like Biden Schumer and even Mitch already said their political take.
1307153795491663872 2020-09-19 11:05:25 +0800 <BlankAddd> @808constituent How perfect was that music.  And the camera zoom.  Trump really got lucky with that perfect shot.  Probably won‚Äôt get any airtime now to be honest.
1307150313741152256 2020-09-19 10:51:35 +0800 <BlankAddd> @KyleKulinski He said ‚Äúopposite party‚Äù
1307147743798976512 2020-09-19 10:41:22 +0800 <BlankAddd> @Philosophi_Cat @JulieBorowski MAybe like 3 states or something and it would be challenged at every federal court for years.  Like they already have a 5-4 majority and nothing has changed.  Calm down
1307146932133851136 2020-09-19 10:38:08 +0800 <BlankAddd> @LEBassett You need some emotional maturity.  Therapy would help.  I‚Äôm being sincere

1307145247709786112 2020-09-19 10:31:27 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC How was that song playing so perfectly.  Also the camera zoom.  Haha WTF.  Maybe Trump really is a Luckbox.  No way that clip gets played on MSM now.  It was too perfect
1307132573060079620 2020-09-19 09:41:05 +0800 <BlankAddd> @CRLady2016 Wow no Green Party
1307130341262585856 2020-09-19 09:32:13 +0800 <BlankAddd> @nikoCSFB The gop had the majority.  They didn‚Äôt block anything.  They just didn‚Äôt vote to confirm.  If dems had the majority they would confirm every time.
1307129851573399552 2020-09-19 09:30:16 +0800 <BlankAddd> @TianaTheFirst Why would any gop vote against?
1307125399399419906 2020-09-19 09:12:35 +0800 <BlankAddd> @HumanistReport Dude nothings going to change.  The government is a criminal cartel.  Stop believing their stupid game

1307069667417231363 2020-09-19 05:31:07 +0800 <BlankAddd> @treasoncheeto @davidlparsons About what?  You didn't know people were so starving that they ate children?

1307037362216734720 2020-09-19 03:22:45 +0800 <BlankAddd> @PoliticalBetsWC That‚Äôs what I think.  This is has to be fake to make people like Biden more

1306797888542973952 2020-09-18 11:31:10 +0800 <BlankAddd> @RonPlacone The obvious backlash to critics race theory and 1619 crap.  That‚Äôs why the left needs to call out their own or else you get these feedback loops and backlashes.
1306796078906273792 2020-09-18 11:23:58 +0800 <BlankAddd> @HumanistReport No it shouldn‚Äôt.  Keep politics out of education.  You want Trump whatever flags he likes up.

Our green house gas emissions are down 2.5% year over year for the last few years since we have ramped up fracking.  Stop contributing to climate change please.  It‚Äôs serious.
1304590357821227008 2020-09-12 09:19:14 +0800 <BlankAddd> @LorianaPatterso @RonPlacone Yes but Most the times it doesn‚Äôt release methane or enough methane to offset the gains.  The times that it does release that much methane is NOT the norm.

Therefore REDUCING climate change.  We aren‚Äôt in your utopia.  In the actual world today, if we stop fracking then we make climate change worse.  Fact.

1304294471719251968 2020-09-11 13:43:29 +0800 <BlankAddd> @LorianaPatterso @RonPlacone Fracking is a technique used to get oil or natural gas.  But since we started fracking we have accumulated a LOT more natural gas then we would have without fracking.  Therefore we can use more natural gas and less oil.  This isn‚Äôt my opinion.  Fracking is good for climate change
1304292470180573184 2020-09-11 13:35:32 +0800 <BlankAddd> @LorianaPatterso @RonPlacone It can release methane but doesn‚Äôt always.  And it doesn‚Äôt release ‚Äúa ton.‚Äù  And all the natural gas it produces is much better for climate change then burning coal or crude oil.  It‚Äôs not even close.  It‚Äôs literally better for the climate to frack then not to frack.  Thats fact.

1303264225897267200 2020-09-08 17:29:39 +0800 <BlankAddd> @notsofiacoppola Literal Neocons.  He has to go...Pull the band aid off quickly

You downgrade us women to using the shity word ‚Äúwomxn‚Äù but you leave men alone.  Always fucking with us.  Just treat us as equals.  We women deserve it!
1303230670240542720 2020-09-08 15:16:19 +0800 <BlankAddd> @KyleKulinski This chart makes you look like an idiot...
1303229008805470208 2020-09-08 15:09:43 +0800 <BlankAddd> @RonPlacone @ProudSocialist Why is it shit?  Progressives will never vote for Trump so Biden doesn‚Äôt have to worry about them.  Maybe if they all voted gop and crushed then Dems one year that might change.  But right now Biden doesn‚Äôt have to worry about them.
1303223848871944192 2020-09-08 14:49:12 +0800 <BlankAddd> @KyleKulinski They won‚Äôt give us $10 million each.  Like WTF!  Just print that shit and give it to us...

1303077977190621184 2020-09-08 05:09:34 +0800 <BlankAddd> @iamcardib Isn‚Äôt he looking down with eyes closed.  Is this photoshopped?
1303074535399325697 2020-09-08 04:55:53 +0800 <BlankAddd> @kayrosef That was actually a huge statement by Trump.  First President to take on the Pentagon since Eisenhower

1302589450006872065 2020-09-06 20:48:20 +0800 <BlankAddd> @Dissensual Anyone who uses the word comrade in some sort of Marxist fetish way is an idiot...
1302531415909703680 2020-09-06 16:57:44 +0800 <BlankAddd> @marwilliamson You telling people to vote for a mass murdering rapist.  You sound ridiculous
1302454780049022976 2020-09-06 11:53:12 +0800 <BlankAddd> @nikoCSFB Exactly.  He literally said he was going to vote him already.  So Biden doesn‚Äôt give a shit what he says because he already has his vote..
1302454474879807488 2020-09-06 11:51:59 +0800 <BlankAddd> @MMFlint You already said you are going to vote him.  He doesn‚Äôt have to shit sucker...

1302419760244637696 2020-09-06 09:34:03 +0800 <BlankAddd> @LisaJ4Liberty @RonPlacone A homeless person dying is totally different then someone going into a hospital and literally getting turned down because they are 65 or over (Italy &amp; Spain) or waiting and dying on the hallway floor if they do choose to see you.  Nothing close to that happened in U.S.

1302383267136458755 2020-09-06 07:09:02 +0800 <BlankAddd> @spatial_anomaly Ya if amazon provides a good convenient product why not give them the $1.95.  The owner of blockbuster was rich too.  Would you not rent movies back then?

1302338537090551808 2020-09-06 04:11:18 +0800 <BlankAddd> @RonPlacone I wish we had Italy‚Äôs and Spain‚Äôs system with old people denied care and people dying on the hospital floors...
1302333953274073088 2020-09-06 03:53:05 +0800 <BlankAddd> @ABC This was a terrible retelling of the night.  You left out soooo many details.  Like when he was attacked on the ground.  Jump kicked inbred face and hit with a skateboard.  Or when he was chased before the first shooting somebody shot a gun before he did.  Ridiculous reporting
1302332511087857664 2020-09-06 03:47:21 +0800 <BlankAddd> @mtracey They have to know the media hates Trump

1301303793615740928 2020-09-03 07:39:36 +0800 <BlankAddd> @DruciferTurak @killa_cam214 @JoeBiden They know who he is but no arrests.  The prosecutors probably won‚Äôt bring charges cause Portland has Antifa sympathizers high up the chain.  Judges, prosecutors etc etc..
1301286117459722240 2020-09-03 06:29:21 +0800 <BlankAddd> @Chronolxgical I thought you were news about coronavirus lol.  You are really an Antifa organizer?
1301285683915415552 2020-09-03 06:27:38 +0800 <BlankAddd> @GnashvilleCat @BenjaminPDixon I like your analysis but where are you getting more dead bodies with fascism?
1301282303759454209 2020-09-03 06:14:12 +0800 <BlankAddd> @BenjaminPDixon @GnashvilleCat Communism has killed way more then fascism.  Just a fact.  I mean both bottom of the barrel evil.  Doesn‚Äôt really matter what you choose
1301281736496734209 2020-09-03 06:11:57 +0800 <BlankAddd> @bariweiss @NPRCodeSwitch Antifa hates Asian and Jews because they are successful...
1301258827648569344 2020-09-03 04:40:55 +0800 <BlankAddd> @ProudSocialist Communist have killed more and created more misery.  USSR has concentration camps that lasted 50 years.  I mean they are both the evilest of the most evil ideologies.  Doesn‚Äôt matter which you choose.
1301229777521537025 2020-09-03 02:45:29 +0800 <BlankAddd> @KyleKulinski Thank god the DNC is a criminal organization and can stop the issues from even having a chance.  But #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 let‚Äôs go!!
1301228122428174337 2020-09-03 02:38:54 +0800 <BlankAddd> @KyleKulinski Yes cause states are sovereign.  Federal government is not suppose to run the country.  Would be like the EU running all the countries and Europe
1301225244129067008 2020-09-03 02:27:28 +0800 <BlankAddd> @sepeku @barimanalow @laralogan So what?  Even if what you said is all true that doesn‚Äôt change the shootings from self defense to murder.  That‚Äôs what people don‚Äôt get for some reason.  Doesn‚Äôt matter if he was doing stupid shit earlier.
1301209413890514944 2020-09-03 01:24:34 +0800 <BlankAddd> @sepeku @barimanalow @laralogan Video evidence please?  And you still can‚Äôt chase people down and try to steal their weapon.
1301209106221608960 2020-09-03 01:23:20 +0800 <BlankAddd> @HanaRunning @MrAndyNgo @tedwheeler Trump offered to send national guard and he keeps denying the help..
1301208727715016704 2020-09-03 01:21:50 +0800 <BlankAddd> @sepeku @barimanalow @laralogan The were chasing him the first time and shot a pistol while chasing him.  I don‚Äôt know why people argue against video evidence...
1301207225625501696 2020-09-03 01:15:52 +0800 <BlankAddd> @sepeku @laralogan He was chasing the guy....
1301205758298578944 2020-09-03 01:10:02 +0800 <BlankAddd> @inhabitedgarden @eb4prez @charles270 Reprogram the propaganda out of your brain...
1301205531030241281 2020-09-03 01:09:08 +0800 <BlankAddd> @eb4prez Why would you want to live in a racist country when there so many other options?
1301196126754807808 2020-09-03 00:31:46 +0800 <BlankAddd> @LouieBear9 @spekulation Can you tell me how to get exactly 1 follower?  That seems hard to do
1301194669909397505 2020-09-03 00:25:58 +0800 <BlankAddd> @LouieBear9 @spekulation He banned me
1301194239448100865 2020-09-03 00:24:16 +0800 <BlankAddd> @ryanmederATL @Politics_Polls But Biden should have also got a bounce right?
1301193982655963136 2020-09-03 00:23:15 +0800 <BlankAddd> @LouieBear9 @spekulation Somehow the tweet still got me a ban ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1301192292888276992 2020-09-03 00:16:32 +0800 <BlankAddd> @spekulation Imaging..now go home to mommy
1301176250292031488 2020-09-02 23:12:47 +0800 <BlankAddd> @The_Jory14 @MonmouthPoll @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump lol what‚Äôs wrong with 400.  That‚Äôs fine
1301174831694491652 2020-09-02 23:07:09 +0800 <BlankAddd> @elliottyoungpdx @tedwheeler What about the stress fireworks cause to dog and cats.  Or are we not conflating people with dogs?
1301128364070068224 2020-09-02 20:02:30 +0800 <BlankAddd> @tonib @IiJagiellow On murder charges?
1301127866092986370 2020-09-02 20:00:31 +0800 <BlankAddd> @IiJagiellow @tonib Ya why hasn‚Äôt that guy been arrested yet?
1301026757324058624 2020-09-02 13:18:45 +0800 <BlankAddd> @jasonrantz Those are trump supporters
1301023315608219648 2020-09-02 13:05:04 +0800 <BlankAddd> @MrAndyNgo @SeattlePD I thought those were Trumps white supremacist?
1301000058213556225 2020-09-02 11:32:39 +0800 <BlankAddd> @esaagar Not even close.  By far the most dishonest
1300981238170152960 2020-09-02 10:17:52 +0800 <BlankAddd> @RonPlacone That‚Äôs for libertarians not socialist.  We can‚Äôt get free healthcare off the grid!  What‚Äôs wrong with you.  We would actually have to survive without government!
1300917939546148864 2020-09-02 06:06:21 +0800 <BlankAddd> @TheDiDiDelgado Can you send me a picture of the smile I'm so supposed to to do.  I am reading white fragility and learning to be anti-racist and its so awesome how good i will be for you black people once i learn everything.  Stay safe sista    #BidenHarris2020
1300849604607393792 2020-09-02 01:34:49 +0800 <BlankAddd> @Marys_Wall411 @mistahbiggtime @NPR Not relevant to whether the shootings were in self defense...
1300849453415317509 2020-09-02 01:34:12 +0800 <BlankAddd> @NPR Video footage is not evidence?
1300844714569035776 2020-09-02 01:15:23 +0800 <BlankAddd> @gatewaypundit They want a new AG
1300821414795046912 2020-09-01 23:42:48 +0800 <BlankAddd> @MSNBC @JoyAnnReid So all those bail funds I do donated to were  bailing out Trump supporters?  Wait why are Trump supporters looting?  I am so confused.  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
1300688798422949888 2020-09-01 14:55:49 +0800 <BlankAddd> @duder_esque @TimRunsHisMouth @tariqnasheed He didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúhe suspects‚Äù he said he is ‚Äúa suspected.‚Äù  And I don‚Äôt think there is any evidence of that.  So it‚Äôs slander
1300688368724922369 2020-09-01 14:54:07 +0800 <BlankAddd> @tariqnasheed The cop is Mexican you sick disturbed demon.
1300686843315331072 2020-09-01 14:48:03 +0800 <BlankAddd> @808constituent It was a self proclaimed Antifa with a BLM fist tattooed on his neck.  Probably a Bernie or Bust type.
1300681433166610434 2020-09-01 14:26:33 +0800 <BlankAddd> @killa_cam214 China‚Äôs government really is evil dude.  I‚Äôm a super Ron Paul anti interventionist but China is bad.  They should be called out more.
1300672535583891456 2020-09-01 13:51:12 +0800 <BlankAddd> @Latinos4Lib And choosing people to live on it based on race.  Replace the word black with white in the headline
1300651473173323776 2020-09-01 12:27:30 +0800 <BlankAddd> @RepJoeKennedy Did you see the video footage?  Are you blind?
1300651393250852865 2020-09-01 12:27:11 +0800 <BlankAddd> @EliStokols Did you see the video footage?  Are you blind?
1300649512508125184 2020-09-01 12:19:43 +0800 <BlankAddd> @igorbobic Did you watch the videos?
1300632353258127360 2020-09-01 11:11:32 +0800 <BlankAddd> @RonPlacone Why?
1300625673095008256 2020-09-01 10:44:59 +0800 <BlankAddd> @BernieSanders So the bail funds were for white supremacist?  Why did you tell me to donate to bail funds if it‚Äôs to bail out white supremacist doing the looting?  I‚Äôm so confused...
1300617276089982976 2020-09-01 10:11:37 +0800 <BlankAddd> @NateSilver538 I mean dow over 30k could be huge
1300616920048177154 2020-09-01 10:10:12 +0800 <BlankAddd> @808constituent It‚Äôs more from Antifa destroying cities...I can‚Äôt stand Kamala but that is just the truth
1300610418574942208 2020-09-01 09:44:22 +0800 <BlankAddd> @gelliottmorris The crime...
1300593208758476800 2020-09-01 08:35:59 +0800 <BlankAddd> @KyleKulinski Depends on what the benefits are
