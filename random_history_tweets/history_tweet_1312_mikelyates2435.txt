Which means any increase in your income will be erased and you revert back to what you were paying before cuts.  Which would mean tax increases for all.

1316111246270312450 2020-10-14 04:19:07 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @JoeConchaTV I made the mistake of getting on an elevator in Vegas with this man.  He was yelling , cursing and waving his arms at the heavens.   It was highly entertaining.   Of course I don't speak or make eye contact with these types.  Learned that defense at the Boston Commons, Mass.

The U.S. should defund immediately and reclaim the property it is located on.    All visas should be cancelled and representatives expelled.  Diplomacy should be one on one.

The longer he worked with the President and saw his dream for all Americans I think he got on board with the administration agenda.  I could be mistaken.  Only God and V. P. Pence know for sure.

I get a pneumonia vaccination, a shingles vax and a flu vax.  The flu vax is never 100% but sometimes they get it right.   Nothing is 100% except death.  God is also a 100% er.

Bad juju.

1311650185144143873 2020-10-01 20:52:28 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @FrankKurt8 @DollyParton No shame here.   God bless you.
1311493953997492226 2020-10-01 10:31:39 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @DollyParton He was a strong , talented, beautiful man.  I met him when I was taking care of his brother.  He was always caring and generous.  He purchased a new van for us so we could provide trips and entertainment for his brother and fellow patients.  God comfort and bless his loved ones.

1311430797652619265 2020-10-01 06:20:42 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @greta It was the moderator not the format.
1311430537605787649 2020-10-01 06:19:40 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @JoeConchaTV I will put it this way: if Wallace was a telemarketer I would hang up on him immediately.  He is just as annoying.

Mac would visit often.  He donated a van so his brother and fellow patients could go on outings.  God bless and comfort his loved ones.

1311410511804805120 2020-10-01 05:00:05 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @SenFeinstein It took you 20 years to fire the Chinese spy who was your driver.   How much damage to our country are you personally responsible for???

1311369546239016962 2020-10-01 02:17:18 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @alexsalvinews Bullshit !
1311369081208164352 2020-10-01 02:15:27 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @drawandstrike It is because of Nunes insight that this info has come to light.  The nation owes him a great debt of gratitude.
1311367833650110467 2020-10-01 02:10:30 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @ItsTJChang When he descended the golden escalators with Melania at his side.  He was a breath of fresh air for a nation trapped in the web of crooked political parties.

1311365337535971329 2020-10-01 02:00:35 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @AlexBerenson Trump will win overwhelmingly.  There will be no more lockdowns in America.  Can't say that for the rest of the civilized world.  Look at Israel and United Kingdom.
1311364515183955968 2020-10-01 01:57:19 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @RealSLokhova Selective memory.  All politicians have it.
1311363144162344962 2020-10-01 01:51:52 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @DmitriyMolla I agree with you 100%.  They should be designated a terrorist organization and rigorously pursued.  Director Wray is incorrect in his characterisation.  That along with other stonewalling is why he should be fired.

Republicans will retake the House and hold the Senate.  There will probably be 2 Supreme Court vacancies during Trumps second term and they will be overwhelmingly confirmed.  GOD WINS !

I was with the same man for 38 years but only have 3 photos of us together.  We lived a good life but didn't document with photos.  Now that he is deceased I regret not keeping a camera handy.  We were too busy living life.

1307799769197293576 2020-09-21 05:52:17 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @HeyTammyBruce It's a crying shame that Claire and her Democrat acquaintances have cheapened the real estate market value of this home and all property in Democrat run cities.   Riots, fire, vandalism , rising crimes against citizens, graffiti ,  all courtesy of the democrats.  The mass exodus.

1307776683211190274 2020-09-21 04:20:33 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @SharylAttkisson Is the current preferred word label  queer or is it gay?.  I'm gay and prefer gay but am not up to date on trends.
1307759772461133826 2020-09-21 03:13:21 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @catturd2 It was to honor you of course.    Could also relate to the up and coming Senate interviews of whomever he nominated for Supreme Court...remember the questioning of Kavanaugh about his yearbook or calendar entries about farting.  I forget the word Kav used.

The worst part is that we are there for their viewing pleasure permanently unknowingly enslaved.  President Trump was/ is the INTERRUPTOR.  We've caught a glimpse of the reality of it all.God help

President nominates then  they vote.  It has happened many times including successfully voting on the same day they are nominated.

We must protect our country, our constitution, our freedoms our God given rights.   Never let your guard down.   Faith in God,   Family ,  Country in that order.    Good v. Evil. Light v Darkness

She had the most joyful spirit and lived each day to the fullest.  We laughed a lot.  Her photos of family retrieved after the war were documentation of a good and happy life in Germany pre Nazi.
1306281791565836289 2020-09-17 01:20:23 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @PaulObrienUSA Another friend who was in a camp shared stories of how it happened so quickly, they were caught off guard.  Loyal German citizens of many generations living a good life one day and vermin to be annihilated the next day.  I reverently touched her tattooed if number.
1306280463993102336 2020-09-17 01:15:06 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @PaulObrienUSA It should be a requirement in our educational system to address these issues.  I've known Germans who were there who deny it happened.  Post WW2 war brides that married Amer. soldiers.  As recent as 5 years ago my friend is 38 years and passed at age  97 said Hitler was wonderful
1306278694344851463 2020-09-17 01:08:04 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @PaulObrienUSA In the sixties a cohort of Simon Wiesenthal came to our church and spoke.   He was a holaucaust survivor.  He spoke for an hour and then showed seized Nazi footage from the death camps.   I was probably 13.  I will never forget the experience.  It is seared into my soul.

He has spoken in the United Nations about protecting our rights and protecting LBTQ  lives around the world.  No other world leader has been so outspoken.

Also religious services were in Latin which the common man could not interpret.  Simplification is the best mode of communication.  God Bless !

What you see in Venezuela and Cuba is our gate of they succeed.  Hope all cease to be.   God sent an imperfect man at a momentous time to lead us away from that destruction

They want to continue murdering millions of unborn children without restrictions.   They want to take from those who work hard to provide for their families and give it away to freeloaders.  They want to seize houses and property.

The ugliness being repeated on the streets everyday is not what our country is about.   We want everyone to succeed in life.   We strive to lift everyone up.

They will permanently change our constitution our laws our freedoms that have set us apart from the rest of the world.   We are still the beacon of light ..

1305956439979110401 2020-09-16 03:47:33 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @Ronflight400 These relationships are worth every bit of effort good and bad.   The same with people.  It's hard seeing them fade.  My mom's 88, my cats 22, one of my dogs 12 , a yellow nape Amazon 35.   They have enriched my life and I theirs. God's creatures all.

They got away with it.  They have now dived head first into the waters full force, nothing held back,  sink or swim with support of Democrat party and the deep state actors

And results in loss of life of our soldiers and innocent civilians.  It's all about status quo cash machine for those types.  Ex.: Bush administration and weapons of mass destruction.

Knowing early voting was happening.   They should hang their fucking heads in shame .   Those loudest should resign from Congress and the Military reduced in rank.

1305612340260491265 2020-09-15 05:00:13 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @laralogan Just pick another person from the picture attached to the article.   Pin the tail on the donkey with a missile anyone.   It has been done effectively before and can be repeated.   I don't think the Iranians want to go that route.  I know we dont.
1305602381237956608 2020-09-15 04:20:39 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @KarluskaP I love u Karli.  Your humor and joy is infectious .

1305598482967859200 2020-09-15 04:05:09 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @ArchitectureTud An inspirational photo..  Even abandoned you can feel God's presence.  Think of all the prayers sent to God when it was active.  Births, funerals, marriages, baptisms.....God is good !
1305597500498366470 2020-09-15 04:01:15 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @KendallGAGOP Thank you all for your hard work.  Where do I get a sign in Augusta ?  American Flags everywhere but no Trump signs on my street.

1305524126946394112 2020-09-14 23:09:41 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @ArchitectureTud Suite not sweet.  Although that could be apropos.
1305522882500493312 2020-09-14 23:04:45 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @RoscoeBDavis1 The gait and splayed legs  suggests a "little person " ( midget, dwarf).  No offense intended.
1305521929944739840 2020-09-14 23:00:58 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @kristofergpitts That calls for detention hall.  Will meet you after class.

1305517932747816967 2020-09-14 22:45:05 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @ArchitectureTud I designed a massive master bedroom sweet for a married couple in black against my personal convictions.  They desired it.   It was beautiful.   Three years later she had a mental breakdown and they divorced.   Follow your instincts..

These 2 and others like them are the reason we are facing the problems we have now.   It's time for a new crop of politicians that prioritize America and the American people.  We need 4 more years of Trump as we reorganize andfocus

1305189054896631808 2020-09-14 00:58:14 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @RichardGrenell And I used to think Jeremy was so cute and intelligent.  Every time he has lied on behalf of his Masters he loses credibility and "cuteness".   To be honest he's just another toad in a pond of swamp creatures.

I have my own and prefer never to hear God used in conjunction with damn.  Language like that was never used in our household, in any friendly conversations I was involved in .

1305171400773206016 2020-09-13 23:48:05 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @JoeBiden A vote in support for Biden/Harris and anyone on the Democrat Party ticket is a vote for the execution of the Men and Women in Blue.  The Democrat Party is the party of anarchy and chaos.   God save America.
1305163282391728129 2020-09-13 23:15:49 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @NYCMayor It is clear to all freedom living Americans now.  A vote for Biden/Harris and anyone connected to the Democrat Party is a vote for the execution of all the Men and Women in Blue.   God save America.  The Democrat Party is the party of anarchy and chaos.
1305161417448882180 2020-09-13 23:08:25 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @BryanDeanWright The future is clear now.  If someone supports Biden/ Harris they are advocating for the execution of the Men and women in Blue.  There is no middle ground anymore.   Our way of life is on the line this election cycle.

No one allowed on the streets after dark.  No excuses.  These are not protests after dark.  They are riotous acts of insurrection.  Screw civil liberties.  Enough is enough.   SAVE OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM.

No one is lending absolute power to the Democrat  mayors, governors or states attorney generals.  They have seized control unconstitutionally and are not yielding it .   One onerous election cycle can destroy our nation.

1304532613298819072 2020-09-12 05:29:46 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @molmccann @N3lson1769 This was in the 70's.   His quest was treatment or vaccine.   Idiot couldn't even name the disease for years. I took care of dozens of acquaintances through the years because of ignorance and fear.  God was in my heart and mind always holding my hand as I held theirs.
1304531267841601537 2020-09-12 05:24:25 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @molmccann @N3lson1769 I remember taking care of a friend dying from aids in the hospital.   The nursing staff would only enter the room for vitals.   I would change his sheets, wash him, feed him clean his bottom.  They thought it was airborne and through contact.  False info put out by Fauci ites.

Just tell your boss you may have been exposed to corona thru a boyfriend.  You can use my name.  It's not implausible we live in close proximity.   Call a friend or counselor.   Help is available.

1304137771100106753 2020-09-11 03:20:48 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @TimTebow No it does not.   God is always there.   In the stillness of the night, the babble of a brook, the rustling of leaves,  the deterioration in an  abandoned cathedral,  the reflection of a childs eyes or even the eyes of a feral animal when you give them food. I feel him always.
1304064751849418752 2020-09-10 22:30:39 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @kristofergpitts Thank you for your testimony.

1303679581908545536 2020-09-09 21:00:08 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @PaulObrienUSA I know that feeling of pure unadulterated joy they experience when they see you.   As part of my job as an activity therapist years ago I would pull up to my building at a nursing care facility and yell " bus ride" !  I could clear out the building via stampede in minutes.
1303509614160470016 2020-09-09 09:44:44 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @IanMCallander True that. For an inspirational story read about the founder of Publix.  He was a giver from the get go.   The company has kept his legacy going.

While waiting in post op hallway I awakened from sedation. I groggy as I was requested paper and pencil and requested them to remove it ASAP.  They did.  Only meant for shortest terms possible . Not weeks.

1303356539869241349 2020-09-08 23:36:28 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @Mrmikeus I like the blue cabinets.  Maybe do a draft with blue on the bottom and white cabs on the top.   The layout is functional and uses every inch of available space.   Good lighting will be key.  Combo of recessed cans, under cabinet  and pendulum over island.   Excited for you .
1303353229116420096 2020-09-08 23:23:19 +0800 <mikelyates2435> @gatewaypundit Unacceptable!  They are either part of the problem, the problem, or part of the solution, or the solution.

Repeat offender.
