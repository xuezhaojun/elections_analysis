1330976604693073921 2020-11-24 04:48:45 +0800 <AllForeverPeace> Lol🙄Obama signed in 2015 the executive order that sentenced Venezuela as "an extraordinary menace to national security" with Biden as VP. Nothing new. Both parties have the same criminal policy for the State Department: Turn arms of any country that does not want to be a colony.

A project for peace did not get "go ahead" and our entire team is pretty much disappointed. So, we are all taken a break but we shall come back. In the mean time, my solidarity to all in #DiaDeLaResistenciaIndigena

I took a break from too much work and came for a few minutes to write and rt about #October12 that it is wrongly labeled #DiadelaHispanidad when in reality is how the people of brave Venezuela calls it #DiaDeLaResistenciaIndígena
1312823666347061250 2020-10-05 02:35:27 +0800 <AllForeverPeace> @spatial_anomaly You and a lot more like us. Biden does not represent the left at all. Far from it. Unfortunately, we are all still orfands of a real left party. One day...🧐

1311043178674429953 2020-09-30 04:40:26 +0800 <AllForeverPeace> @smartass_girl Surely a lot of people will tune in for the #Debates2020 #PresidentialDebate2020.  However, the entire world is kind of too much...🙄Continues to be an error to think that, we, the USA, is the center of the world.
1311040688021213185 2020-09-30 04:30:32 +0800 <AllForeverPeace> Pick. Neither one will work for PEACE to everyone in the entire WORLD #Debates2020  https://t.co/fan2GJ17Qi

1311038244306522113 2020-09-30 04:20:50 +0800 <AllForeverPeace> @pryor_notices Shameful. How can it be? Simple. We all allow it. Shame on us as well.
1311037127241732098 2020-09-30 04:16:23 +0800 <AllForeverPeace> @pryor_notices Exactly. Just add both will certainly lie.
