1344048979756142592 2020-12-30 06:33:42 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I have grown to appreciate solitude for this reason. Community is important and I enjoy it, but it also can reach a point where the conversation is held back because everything must be watered down in such a way that the whole group understands it. I enjoy being unbound
1344042916780638214 2020-12-30 06:09:37 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I find that when talking to most people you're essentially having the same 2-3 conversations over and over. They don't seem to add anything new to their lives, whether in knowledge or experiences, and thus rehash the same thing. Wonder if this is modern or if was always this way
1344025565720956928 2020-12-30 05:00:40 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @AmericanThad Yeah we don't need anything this complex or horrifying. If people stopped supporting businesses that use factory farming they would be forced to adapt or die. Grass fed meat is more expensive but if you cut out like, one or two bags of Doritos from your shopping list you're good
1344023394497527813 2020-12-30 04:52:02 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> took its place as master. The only difference in the dialectic now is that the master is now an ambiguous collective entity, oftentimes not even understood by the people who comprise it, as opposed to a rigidly defined monarch or aristocratic class.
1344023393700605960 2020-12-30 04:52:02 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> "world citizen" living under the guidance of the State. What came after(Cold War) was merely a political squabble on the best way to enact the same philosophy. Obviously the dialectic was not in the least bit overcome. The State, market, or whatever you wish to call it merely
1344023392647868418 2020-12-30 04:52:02 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Many see capitalism vs communism as the great duality of the modern epoch, but I think that was only true due to the elimination of fascism from the equation. The greater ideological battle was won by those attempting a transcendence of master-slave in the form of a
1344023391603470336 2020-12-30 04:52:01 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I sometimes feel as if WW2 can partially be summarized as a struggle between the former viewpoint (backed by capitalism/communism) and the latter (fascism).
1344023390684901378 2020-12-30 04:52:01 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> The largely Marxist interpretation of Hegelian master-slave dialectic as something to be overcome and transcended, rather than adapted to as part of the natural order, has permeated nearly all of postmodern society at this point.
1344021989820919808 2020-12-30 04:46:27 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @HerrRintfleisch That's why I prefer Evola to him, and wouldn't recommend most people read Nietzsche. Dangerous path to walk on for those without the Will to overcome it. Taking his word as gospel will make you like him. Have to take what was good from him while also reading between the lines
1344020446212214784 2020-12-30 04:40:19 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @HerrRintfleisch Rather, I would take Evola's stance that Nietzsche didn't really go far enough into his own ideology. He didn't pursue the will to power and instead got hung up on the abyss, and it consumed him. Nietzsche was unable to Ride the Tiger and was thus devoured.
1344019249405292545 2020-12-30 04:35:34 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @HerrRintfleisch He was essentially the discoverer of the underlying madness of postmodernity, the "death of God", as he put it. The trauma of being among the first ones to throw that curtain back would probably cause most men to go mad. I don't think that his madness is a refutation of his ideas
1343892181740900354 2020-12-29 20:10:39 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> The more I think about it, Macedonia could be example of Hegel's thesis-antithesis-synthesis. Greek state arises, splits up into various states each with their own merits and downfalls, Macedonia admires all of it from the outside, creates new empire with values from all states
1343890417012645889 2020-12-29 20:03:38 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral Oh yeah, the lifestyle and character of the individual citizen was unmatched. They also did female empowerment the right way, or at least much better than most

1343852658713636866 2020-12-29 17:33:36 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral I think Alexander's Macedonia was just the improved sequel to Greece
1343852468376121345 2020-12-29 17:32:50 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral Sparta was a bit too collectivist and ascetic for my taste. Best Greek state, much better than the decadent Athens, but they were definitely missing something that Athens had. Thebes too, dudes kinda wrecked Sparta because they were more athletic and Sparta fought em too much
1343850795784167424 2020-12-29 17:26:11 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Does Twitter cause you to unfollow people at times? Have had several occasions of having to refollow people lately

1343718477828390912 2020-12-29 08:40:24 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> It's crazy how unified our entire media establishment is in desperately wanting you to see 2020 as a terrible year with little to no positives. Can't relate, I had insane growth this year against adversity. 2021 will be even better. In fact I may just ascend.
1343717293705076739 2020-12-29 08:35:42 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @barbarianage Yeah that was almost assuredly slander produced by Phillip and Clement to weaken the Templars' massive popularity. Their leader was forced to confess under torture but later denied all accusations in front of the crowd knowing it would get him burned to death immediately
1343715504184242178 2020-12-29 08:28:35 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @barbarianage We must bring this back. Knights' Templar was also great in its emphasis on warriors' discipline and strength, which I believe is part of the reason it was stamped out. The bugmen are everywhere...we need to create barriers of every everywhere to keep them out
1343714623455981568 2020-12-29 08:25:05 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> a more visceral and physical practice, where adherents are held accountable for what they put in their bodies. The best we ever get is "Your body is a temple" as a vague support for good health practices. Need concrete things that infuse bodily health with spiritual significance
1343713911204425728 2020-12-29 08:22:16 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> etc. So your spirituality is intrinsically linked to physical health at least in certain areas. Christianity only has physical rituals in the form of Sacraments like Communion or Baptism, which are certainly good. But I think that the Christianity of the future must incorporate
1343713508958105601 2020-12-29 08:20:40 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> One of the biggest disadvantages Christianity has is a lack of physical health practices as sacred ritual. Eastern spirituality has pranayama, Taoist breathing, etc. If you truly follow these faiths you will breathe well. Paganism glorifies things like physical health, hunting

1343367894701322242 2020-12-28 09:27:19 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @elfnostate I partially agree in that I think the Demiurge is clearly real (Nietzsche knew about him as well) but I also believe there are other benevolent deities to vindicate other religions as well. Or perhaps they are all merely different aspects of the same Being

1343029407619932160 2020-12-27 11:02:17 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Pick up a book. Go for a walk. Play a video game. Idc, just do something that will at least add a genuine experience to your life.
1343028842320048129 2020-12-27 11:00:02 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @WineUncle Precisely, literally nothing of value in Zuccworld. Just a massive abyss for people to dump free time into with no ROI

1343027146198044672 2020-12-27 10:53:18 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Scrolling Facebook or Instagram is one of the lowest forms of entertainment in human history
1342643967284948992 2020-12-26 09:30:41 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Pro tip for competition: Get angry at your opponent. Remember how bad you felt last time you lost, and realize this person is trying to make you feel that way again, to destroy your happiness. Understand what an awful human being he must be to do such a thing, punish him for it
1342337451029889024 2020-12-25 13:12:42 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Sleep is very important but can become addiction like any other good thing. Can get to a point where you never get enough and you never get anything done and/or screw up circadian rhythms. Be careful!

1341791124860653571 2020-12-24 01:01:48 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Even if shows like South Park or Rick&amp;Morty were that funny or had anything worthwhile to say, I still wouldn't watch because of how aesthetically hideous they are. I guarantee looking at ugly things for hours on end has an effect on you.

1341531330312613889 2020-12-23 07:49:28 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> You're already seeing the Pepe KFC and the "Return to Monke" Devour ad. They can consumerize anything. Unless you can transcend the memes those ads will be the only change the far right brings to society. Another advertising fad blowing by in the wind
1341530751704154118 2020-12-23 07:47:10 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I get that memes are just the way of the world nowadays and you have to use them to spread ideas, but if you reach a point where you have nothing deeper than that your movement becomes a glorified club that serves as nothing more than another media distraction.
1341530096172187648 2020-12-23 07:44:34 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Many in the RWBB community get salty when I point this out, sorry but not all of us in the far-right want to just meme all the time. If you're going to troll and push normies to constantly get better you have to be able to take it yourself. I'm not here to be a yes man!
1341529645691383809 2020-12-23 07:42:46 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> If you want to bodybuild that's fine. It's more productive than what 99% of people do. Nothing wrong with wanting a good physique, in fact I think it should be a goal for everyone. But overall athleticism is what we are going to need much more in the upcoming strife.

But Bronze Age man saw prowess in war as the height of human physicality and that involves functionality more than looksmaxxing

1341523586906005505 2020-12-23 07:18:42 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @stoneagedirtbag @LandsharkRides It's not even about that. It's the fact that doing highly constrained and predictable movements with the end goal of maximizing looks will not give you much functionality in real life situations. Spartan soldiers were not bodybuilding

1341242652860268544 2020-12-22 12:42:22 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Physique is obviously important, but it should be more of an added benefit of your fitness than the goal itself. If all you do is highly constrained and predictable movements (i.e gym exercises) that's the only place where your physical prowess will be impressive
1341241064003407874 2020-12-22 12:36:03 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Movement training is key to being athletic in real life situations outside of the gym. Things such as the lizard crawl or kong will make you feel like a weakling regardless of what your bench press or squat max is.

1341175899597774854 2020-12-22 08:17:06 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @AmericanThad Yep, and most of the art hoes are just getting carried by good genetics in their youth, the whimsical hedonism will catch up to them when they hit the wall in their 30s
1341175298902155265 2020-12-22 08:14:43 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @YoungEmissary Don't let your dreams be dreams
1341175049009700864 2020-12-22 08:13:44 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @EbowEnnis Ahhh, and now the picture becomes that much clearer
1341162693345079298 2020-12-22 07:24:38 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Highly recommend reading this man's works, much wisdom on the psychology of the mob hive mind...
1341162340713173000 2020-12-22 07:23:14 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Twitter @_major_williams GTFO with these lame sponsored tweets unless you're willing to fight me
1341161769566400512 2020-12-22 07:20:58 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @sellyourcloaka1 I do only more jacked, equal feats of heroism and strength tho
1341161010804248578 2020-12-22 07:17:57 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @anonhegemon U.S giving out those Dolly Parton relief packages-top heavy. What a shocker
1341160137650810881 2020-12-22 07:14:29 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Approximately 6,000 movie theaters exist in the U.S. meaning an average of 2.5 million was doled out to each theater. $600 per citizen though. Do you get it yet?  https://t.co/yHRZVUOUIa
1340861159977705473 2020-12-21 11:26:27 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Cyberpunk 2077? Why do I need that when I have Ion Fury?  https://t.co/wxtjMijGJV
1340858414835109889 2020-12-21 11:15:32 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @hrgsprgz And I don't even like stoners or coomers btw lol, just the hypocrisy is what gets me
1340858307167313921 2020-12-21 11:15:07 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @hrgsprgz I think could be fine if used from clean source in moderation (and obviously alongside a healthy lifestyle). I just think the amount of cope where dudes diss stoners or coomers for being "addicted" is ridiculous lol. It all boils down to truly mastering oneself, not LARP memeing
1340857279420248065 2020-12-21 11:11:01 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> "Dude this stuff is actually really good for you, in fact it's a COVID vaccine! I mean...if I were to stop using it I'd have physical withdrawal symptoms and feel like garbage for the next few days, but dude it's perfectly healthy no side effects!"
1340855344239702016 2020-12-21 11:03:20 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> It's nice to be someone who doesn't need any kind of buzz every day to function, but also doesn't have to be hyper-ascetic and prude just to prove I have self-discipline.
1340854894463512576 2020-12-21 11:01:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Cigarette guys on here be like "Umm ACKSHUALLY stoners ARE addicted because they need to smoke to unwind every day." Right, so that makes them just as dependent on a substance as you are. You're just as bad as them. It's called projection
1340854335421501446 2020-12-21 10:59:20 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Even if cigarettes and dip had zero negative side effects, it's still pretty weak being physically unable to go a day without a buzz to get you through. Like an adult pacifier.

1340514814335053827 2020-12-20 12:30:11 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @HerrRintfleisch Literally what I am reading now and what inspired this tweet lmao
1340514237190443008 2020-12-20 12:27:54 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> When the Christians were attempting to convert the Saxons they had a hard time conveying the concept of humility to them. Not because their philosophy was simply at odds with the Saxons' but because the Saxons literally did not have a word in their language to even describe it

1340488380820447233 2020-12-20 10:45:09 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @WineUncle Yeah, I think it's kinda the default model for life outside of work. Once you get home it's considered the norm to just veg out. Takes willpower to break out of the mold and rewire. I've just never been that way I guess, if anything I've had to make sure I sleep enough lol
1340487181379354625 2020-12-20 10:40:23 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I've never been able to process how people just lay around or sleep all day on a regular basis lmao
1340458817637785605 2020-12-20 08:47:41 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> St Boniface chopping down Donar's Oak is one of the most deplorable acts in Christian history, hands down. I have little to no respect for Boniface
1340434189158658054 2020-12-20 07:09:49 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> The idea that "women are two years more mature than men their age" is the most hilarious and false meme that the mainstream crowd has spread.

1340400207708696576 2020-12-20 04:54:47 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I think that when you are kind to animals they, through their deep connections with nature, place protective magic over you. Is obvious to anyone who interacts with animals often

1340150188992806912 2020-12-19 12:21:18 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I'm very interested in the primordial gods of Greek myth such as Chaos, Gaia, Erebus etc. Much less known about them, very mysterious and powerful. Chaos very reminiscent of Tao
1340146731330187264 2020-12-19 12:07:34 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @bronzeagemantis Should I block all womon account to be safe

1340011250323959809 2020-12-19 03:09:12 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Atheist arguments consist of just going down the list of logical fallacies from their college Speech class textbook and throwing it out as a deus ex machina

1339770742477627392 2020-12-18 11:13:31 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Hilarious how atheists are so out of touch with their own inner experience that they perceive anything short of God physically descending from Heaven to give them explicitly-stated life advice as "silence."

1339411064535080960 2020-12-17 11:24:17 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> If you spend any extended period of time scrolling on social media daily, but can't read 10 pages a day from a good book, you really gotta reevaluate your life's direction.
1339402173982142464 2020-12-17 10:48:57 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> When asked how far Sparta's borders reached, Agesilaus threw his spear and said "As far as this can reach." Unbelievably powerful.

1339379194728427520 2020-12-17 09:17:39 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Dudes keep buying from AAA devs like Bioware, Ubisoft or Bethesda and wonder why they keep getting scammed. Stop supporting garbage lmao. I rarely get disappointed because I only trust company that earn it.
1339378742158831625 2020-12-17 09:15:51 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> People take the Cyberpunk criticism to an excess when they say that the whole industry is like this. Have you ever tried maybe...buying from good companies. Nintendo, Platinum, Capcom, plenty of companies release quality products on a consistent basis.
1339370695453761542 2020-12-17 08:43:52 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I have little to no respect for 90% of professional athletes. NBA players who get paid millions to work out and play a game showing up to preseason fat. That tells me that you have the soul of a typical American citizen and wouldn't even be in shape if you weren't in the league.

1339066501446430720 2020-12-16 12:35:07 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I really think many people just read Evola promoting "Tradition" and then built their whole philosophy around it without actually reading further to see what he meant by that word.
1339066254062219264 2020-12-16 12:34:08 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Many people in the FR love Evola/BAP, but also tell people to "just get married" as a Band-Aid solution to postmodern existential angst. Completely ignoring that both BAP and Evola have whole sections of their book stating that marriage does not inherently confer purpose to life.
1339064787834167297 2020-12-16 12:28:18 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> The only real usefulness in reading Kant is to resolve the common modern existential crisis of "nothing existing outside the human mind," or just as an exercise for your analytical thinking. After that, it's probably time to get better quality material.

1338983219174248452 2020-12-16 07:04:11 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> If I'm able to translate "The Fight as Inner Experience" by Jünger I may end up publishing it so that others can read as well. Depends how much it costs, I'm really just doing it so I can read it, but it would be cool to make it available for others as well.
1338863723235065859 2020-12-15 23:09:21 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> It's that time of year again where people urge others not to post any pics of presents under the tree because it might "make others who can't afford them feel bad about themselves." Have you ever tried just not looking at social media?
1338859435544825860 2020-12-15 22:52:18 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Much less read or meditate daily. It isn't hard, you're just unmotivated.
1338754259387625472 2020-12-15 15:54:22 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @MavrosArkouda Nah, I just watched videos and such but tbh I kinda lost hype for it a while before release
1338685851497328646 2020-12-15 11:22:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @matthewross22 For me it's Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday of intense training. Wednesday normally a true rest day for a mid-week recharge although I usually foam roll or acupressure. Saturday very light active recovery, sometimes true rest day, and then Sunday is yoga day
1338684856482533379 2020-12-15 11:18:36 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @matthewross22 But yeah, a whole 7 days of rest is unnecessary, I don't think the body needs that long to recover barring extreme circumstances. You could accomplish that in 3-4 days tops
1338684429586358272 2020-12-15 11:16:54 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @matthewross22 You should definitely be taking at least 1-2 rest days a week otherwise you're losing gains. Unless you're basically just doing active recovery on some of those days which is just as good as straight up rest. 7 days of hard training a week not efficient though
1338683013677391872 2020-12-15 11:11:16 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @matthewross22 Depends, I typically do like 5 days off after race but any other time I just do a deload week every 4-5 weeks to let my recovery catch up
1338669559964954625 2020-12-15 10:17:49 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @goldeneramindst Agreed. A lot of people sperg out about losing muscle but it would take several weeks of inactivity to get to that point unless you're just not eating lol
1338661972917751819 2020-12-15 09:47:40 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @TIME Stop promoting this to me, first and final warning.
1338654634827804674 2020-12-15 09:18:30 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Which do you prefer for workout recovery?
1338649528669515780 2020-12-15 08:58:13 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @swanabaddie Trads are just normal Instathot simps if you take away the cornfield pics
1338647630377873409 2020-12-15 08:50:40 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @RavageCaproate If I do get Cyberpunk it'll be later on when price drops but tbh after seeing the gay sex scene I kinda don't wanna. Will likely just wait for their next game
1338647208112087040 2020-12-15 08:48:59 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @RavageCaproate Yeah I'm not gonna just relegate them to the Bethesda/Bioware tier. You're allowed to have blunders and you're right this is a different style of project. Witcher had some small bugs but nothing major and it was overall a  really solid game so they're still better than most devs.
1338645464925802498 2020-12-15 08:42:04 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> There are some devs like Nintendo or Platinum that still hold their products to a high standard, but overall most major companies should not be given benefit of the doubt anymore. Stop pre-ordering until the industry can prove it deserves your trust.
1338645036557340675 2020-12-15 08:40:22 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Projekt Red defenders have a point that other big games did the same thing without getting criticized like this, and that's valid. They should all be blasted. When you're a AAA dev with millions of dollars to throw into a project, there's no reason you can't make a masterpiece.
1338644413350883331 2020-12-15 08:37:53 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> The issue with the Cyberpunk release isn't that it needed to be perfect. It's that when a game has been delayed since 2014 and costs $60, there's no excuse to not release a finished product that doesn't need a large day one patch to run properly.
1338643325272862721 2020-12-15 08:33:34 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Also the fact that it's trendy to call anything visually appealing "_____ Porn" is very telling on how perverted our general population has become. If you use "porn" as a synonym for "things I like to look at" you're already gone.
1338638350241107970 2020-12-15 08:13:48 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @LandsharkRides He was ahead of his time philosophically but he came at the wrong time for Egypt
1338628658404204549 2020-12-15 07:35:17 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> People don't realize that willpower, intelligence, confidence, etc work the same as muscles. No matter how weak yours may be, you can strengthen it through training, and it's no one's fault but your own if you don't. Too many people think the mind is a fixed, unchangeable thing.
1338627174039957504 2020-12-15 07:29:23 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Introduced a friend to anon Twitter to give a better alternative to the Facebook normie sphere, but he has slowly gravitated back there regardless. You can lead a horse to water!
1338621840357552128 2020-12-15 07:08:11 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @HerrRintfleisch Can be good as a supplementary thing maybe but anyone who labels themselves as a Stoic as their primary identity is cringe
1338615712831696897 2020-12-15 06:43:50 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @chhardman Recommend throwing a lot of dead hangs, farmers carries, etc into upper body days. Will help you annihilate the hanging obstacles
1338292091907149825 2020-12-14 09:17:53 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @leonesople @DanielHarshman8 @alejandrof283 @PromoMike_ @BronzeAgeBot Projection
1338285474343956480 2020-12-14 08:51:35 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> If taking too much magnesium or liver is the worst health habit you have, I think you're gonna be pretty well off. Fixing the glaring holes first
1338281101593354240 2020-12-14 08:34:13 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @DanielHarshman8 @alejandrof283 @PromoMike_ @BronzeAgeBot To most people (the weak) yes
1338280895086727171 2020-12-14 08:33:24 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @saltfleet3 @BronzeAgeBot Yeah, it won't change people loving this quote but unfortunately is false
1338279989855350784 2020-12-14 08:29:48 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Cracks me up when people express concerns about "overdosing" when it cones magnesium, liver pills, and other supplements. Meanwhile they're smoking cigarettes, dipping, eating trash food, or some other toxic nonsense. I think you're worried about the wrong thing lmao
1338202715688734722 2020-12-14 03:22:44 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @bronzeagemantis This lockdown business is their ace in the hole. They are not going to relinquish the leverage that COVID hysteria has given them without a fight. We will either finish them off or live in mask Hell forever
1338198454229753856 2020-12-14 03:05:48 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @HerrRintfleisch Pain
1337894252156739586 2020-12-13 06:57:01 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I would never advise my followers to learn to build EMP devices to combat drones in case of a 1984-style crackdown. But it would definitely be crazy if I did
1337832544419647489 2020-12-13 02:51:48 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Ancient Nordic myth was not being watered down to appeal to a spiritually castrated population. It was the spirit of a people/tradition distilled into stories. So she's onto something but misses the mark entirely in her conclusion
1337831992638005250 2020-12-13 02:49:37 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> The reality is that she isn't wrong with the first bit. Humans project the mythological contents of their unconscious onto everything. But she's also not realizing that comics are a product of consumerism and the purity of their myth is muddled by the shallow goal of profit
1337829928948158464 2020-12-13 02:41:25 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @cerberus399bc Still something uniquely powerful about fighter pilots, mortar shellings etc though. The Biblical rain of fire brought to life. The clash of human wills being fought at inconceivable speeds, very thrilling but I have some futurist tendencies
1337829391473258497 2020-12-13 02:39:17 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @cerberus399bc I think overall you can only remove so much of war's aristocratic nature. Even with guns when both sides have them it will still often come down to which side shows more valor and grit. Though I concur that ancient melee combat was the "purest" and most manly
1337824430576312324 2020-12-13 02:19:34 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @718Tv @EntrepreneurVyl @sixthreeirl Ah I can't remember which one but it involved a pop star who had a virtual avatar with millions of viewers, and somebody just killed her and commandeered the avatar without her fans knowing
1337824094167977984 2020-12-13 02:18:14 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @LandsharkRides Conquering the entire world
1337822891702964224 2020-12-13 02:13:27 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @EntrepreneurVyl Especially ironic that many people in the dissident right love Evola and BAP but totally ignore the sections of their book saying that marriage doesn't inherently provide purpose anymore
1337822448880934918 2020-12-13 02:11:42 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @718Tv @EntrepreneurVyl @sixthreeirl This is just Psycho Pass
1337636396593524736 2020-12-12 13:52:23 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @punishedllama @it_CHUD I definitely could be. But I just don't care to go to tournaments
1337600845387608064 2020-12-12 11:31:07 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @EntrepreneurVyl Trads still be like "Dude just get a wife. It's that simple."
1337585064603955200 2020-12-12 10:28:25 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @BoomerReinhard @TL_TERRORIST_ I was track guy for a while in college(sprinting and long distance) left that and got into college triathlon for more all around fitness, then left that and dedicated to OCR for truly all around fitness lol. Less well known but much better than just running, although running good
1337582449925165060 2020-12-12 10:18:01 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Pius_Vindex Yes exactly this, and I think that his arrogant, high energy personality was amazing for the culture. Having that in office has already broken the mold of leaders having to be the timid, dispassionate "professional" type. He is already a net positive but may have run his course
1337578028717797396 2020-12-12 10:00:27 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> If you plan to stop fighting and accept defeat if Trump leaves the White House, you might as well unfollow me now and go back to the Fox News Republican sphere
1337577781299982337 2020-12-12 09:59:28 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> If you think that a loss in the Supreme Court, or even a loss for Trump altogether, means that your ideals have been defeated, YOU are the blackpiller. The struggle was always bigger than this. Trump was, at best, going to buy us 4 more years of stagnacy.

1337573398017437703 2020-12-12 09:42:03 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @anonhegemon Never said I was stoner tho, it's not like I chronically use it anyway lmao, but it does have less downsides than pretty much everything the RW Twitter sphere promotes

1337571814957002756 2020-12-12 09:35:46 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I'm rooting for Trump as much as all of you, but some of the cope on here makes me almost (keyword:ALMOST) want these lawsuits to keep getting denied so that you guys will finally get angry enough to take action. They are not going to hand you anything.
1337568510478856193 2020-12-12 09:22:38 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @TL_TERRORIST_ @LicenseToVril Do what you want lmao, your lungs to destroy. At least get American spirits if you can't control your addiction
1337568101513179138 2020-12-12 09:21:00 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I'm not trying to blackpill but guys Trump is not gonna win fairly via the justice system. He never was. Otherwise this election never would have been rigged in the first place. I'm not saying he can't but it's going to take him breaking some rules, which I hope he does

1337562587446317057 2020-12-12 08:59:06 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @TL_TERRORIST_ @LicenseToVril Am not in environment where I can take fresh pic but sure, I will post when I get to gym. We all know you will still cope your way back into your addiction when I do though lmao
1337562101653655555 2020-12-12 08:57:10 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @LicenseToVril Too late, you got it anyway!
1337560593222545413 2020-12-12 08:51:10 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @it_CHUD How are athletes automatically twinks lmao, you cannot truly believe bodybuilding is optimal fitness
1337559749940944902 2020-12-12 08:47:49 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @LicenseToVril Nah, you're just retards who somehow thought the system wasn't going to do corrupt things like it always does lmao
1337558772743614470 2020-12-12 08:43:56 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @TL_TERRORIST_ I'm not a bodybuilder I'm an athlete. I actually do things with my body other than pose because that's the real "warrior spirit" that you people LARP about. Does that disqualify me or can I point out obvious truths without being a glorified mannequin?
1337555489794764801 2020-12-12 08:30:54 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @TL_TERRORIST_ If I posted the body I've competed in national championships with, would it even change your mind? Or would you continue to blindly ingest poison like the good little consoomer you are?
1337553071950475264 2020-12-12 08:21:17 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @TL_TERRORIST_ Not impressed tbh. And even if you were impressive you're still going to pay for your unhealthiness down the road

1337531609508155393 2020-12-12 06:56:00 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Many people forget that at the grassroots level, fascism in Europe was inspired by futurism, not traditionalism.
1337453822835384324 2020-12-12 01:46:54 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Mosghos @Azazel90715652 @not_devy Yeah I don't use nic but from everything I've read it isn't the real culprit for pretty much all of the horrific side effects of cigs, dip, etc. I wouldn't really have an issue with people using that alone
1337301848752009216 2020-12-11 15:43:01 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @elfnostate I never said "moving forward into contemporary woke Hollywood culture"
1337301594426236928 2020-12-11 15:42:00 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @elfnostate merely living in their shadows for eternity as many trads would have us do. That is what our ancestors did as well
1337301419452461056 2020-12-11 15:41:18 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @elfnostate Lmao you are putting words into my mouth because you are unwilling to look at this as more complex than just two extreme opposites. There is much I want to bring back from older cultures. I just want to forge it into a new culture on par with that of our ancestors', instead of
1337298129046134785 2020-12-11 15:28:14 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @elfnostate Anything past a certain time period. That is escapism
1337298046116388864 2020-12-11 15:27:54 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @elfnostate You say that like they're aren't plenty of people who do those things today lmao. Either way I get your point and believe modernity has issues, our culture is broken rn. But the answer it to confront these issues and move forward into a new age rather than simply reject
1337292021975887872 2020-12-11 15:03:58 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @elfnostate When did I say any of that was wrong? You don't have to halt a civilizational advancement to do such things. I enjoy many of those
1337291426372214784 2020-12-11 15:01:36 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @elfnostate If some want to do that fine but humanity is not meant to do only that
1337280353841647617 2020-12-11 14:17:36 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @anonhegemon Big mad
1337274341667516417 2020-12-11 13:53:43 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @hrgsprgz @anonhegemon Neil Armstrong and early Cold War space race aesthetic was not like this lol. That is a result of leftie bug culture not space travel itself
1337273406878871553 2020-12-11 13:50:00 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @hrgsprgz @anonhegemon Nothing more than the desire to "own the libs" because media tends to portray space in a Reddit fashion. But I think it's dangerous when we reject everything the Left touches instead of taking it back from them.
1337272874323890176 2020-12-11 13:47:53 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @hrgsprgz @anonhegemon I just think it's a slippery slope to confine things to immediacy or necessity because that gets into utilitarian territory where unless something is right within our reach we don't think it necessary to strive towards it. And on the whole this anti-space sentiment arose from
1337271869582569479 2020-12-11 13:43:53 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @anonhegemon @hrgsprgz So then just don't explore anything? How do you even know there isn't more than just the sea floor down there? Don't you believe in Atlantis?
1337271340009730048 2020-12-11 13:41:47 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @hrgsprgz @anonhegemon We have the ability to go. Just not very far as of now. But I don't really see why that means we can't aspire to go as far as we can.
1337270922923954176 2020-12-11 13:40:07 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @anonhegemon @hrgsprgz I hate NASA as well. But I don't choose to reject organic foods just be a Whole Foods is cringe
1337270755793530883 2020-12-11 13:39:28 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @hrgsprgz @anonhegemon Well by the logic presented here we shouldn't explore the deep ocean because we currently have no tech available to withstand the pressure down there. I suppose God confined us to the land for a reason too
1337270414045802498 2020-12-11 13:38:06 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @hrgsprgz @anonhegemon So then we are embracing defeatism in anticipation of a collapse that has not yet happened or been fought over?
1337270210299092992 2020-12-11 13:37:18 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @anonhegemon @hrgsprgz Then you support entropy and I have nothing to discuss on the eternal spirit of the adventurer with you be a you think the adventure is a means to an end, not the end itself
1337269879012024323 2020-12-11 13:35:59 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @anonhegemon @hrgsprgz I mean it wasn't that far-fetched of a comparison back when medicine and food preservation weren't what they are today. And no one even knew whether the New World existed or not so they all entered that ship with the knowledge that they may never see their destination
1337269324852191233 2020-12-11 13:33:46 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @hrgsprgz @anonhegemon So if we were to explore every continent, comb the ocean floor, etc would that be it? No more exploring? Let's just pack it up, chill at home and celebrate what our ancestors did without trying to go beyond?
1337269013630623746 2020-12-11 13:32:32 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @anonhegemon @hrgsprgz I think if you told them that in their efforts they would pave the way for their descendants to go even further many would still do it
1337268780758671362 2020-12-11 13:31:37 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @anonhegemon @hrgsprgz Many men traveling to America were dead before arrival as well but were glad to die striving
1337268573165727744 2020-12-11 13:30:47 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @hrgsprgz Story of Icarus was a cautionary tale against excess arrogance not a warning to limit the spirit of exploration
1337267505061097472 2020-12-11 13:26:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I'm just saying, if you were to pitch the idea to the ancient Greeks, Romans, Christians, etc of boldly traveling to the skies to see the heavenly bodies in their full majesty, they'd be all in. Should I trust them or a bunch of anons on a phone app?
1337266652698783744 2020-12-11 13:23:09 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @westernbrahmin The virgin science vs the chad natural philosophy
1337266264507551745 2020-12-11 13:21:37 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @anonhegemon @Augustu69731916 @Pius_Vindex Fair
1337264990764544001 2020-12-11 13:16:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @anonhegemon @Augustu69731916 @Pius_Vindex And space travel would quite possibly stimulate the production of such technologies because there would a be a concrete reason to strive for such goals. Shipmaking advanced rapidly from the race to colonize new lands
1337264636945715201 2020-12-11 13:15:09 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @anonhegemon @Augustu69731916 @Pius_Vindex The robotic probes cannot see very far at all much less explore planets in that much detail. We have little to no idea what secrets even Mars may hold. There could very well be ruins of an entire civilization under the surface
1337264193121234949 2020-12-11 13:13:23 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @anonhegemon @Augustu69731916 @Pius_Vindex Not to mention the drive to push further and further into space would also drive the advancement in things such as energy sources, transportation, warfare etc which would also have huge benefits to our culture. War and exploration imbue their culture with a drive to evolve.
1337263642627215362 2020-12-11 13:11:12 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @anonhegemon @Augustu69731916 @Pius_Vindex possible then you're missing the point of what makes Western civilization great. We do it because it's who we are, not hide in fear of the unknown.
1337263429908893700 2020-12-11 13:10:21 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @anonhegemon @Augustu69731916 @Pius_Vindex The spirit of adventure doesn't need a reason to explore unknown territory. We don't have to be utilitarians that only do what's "efficient" or guarantees material results. If you explore continents just to gain resources instead of just to push the boundaries of what we think is
1337262697344274432 2020-12-11 13:07:26 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @anonhegemon @Augustu69731916 @Pius_Vindex "We don't currently have the means to efficiently sail the ocean. Who gives a fuck what the land across the oceans is like lmao God confined us to this continent for a reason."
1337257836569653249 2020-12-11 12:48:07 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @HeathenDharma Yes, unfortunately any group is inevitably going to have a majority of sycophants that contribute no original content or ideas it seems
1337255930363322369 2020-12-11 12:40:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> So why has it become obligatory for movies/games to always include gratuitous sex scenes? 10 minutes that could have gone into advancing the plot, meaningful world-building, etc wasted on a soft pornography scene. Pointless and disgusting
1337250901375979523 2020-12-11 12:20:34 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @EntrepreneurVyl Hades deserved it

1337244170583478272 2020-12-11 11:53:49 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Augustu69731916 @Pius_Vindex that the universe is infinite but it did seem pretty vast. Those are totally beyond our reach as of now but people said the same about other continents at one point
1337243938013458432 2020-12-11 11:52:54 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Augustu69731916 @Pius_Vindex I mean I can't really prove or disprove that but I can say that I worked alongside my college's head of astronomy and observed faraway galaxies myself. They were there but you really couldn't see anything aside from dots of light due to how distant they were. That's not to say
1337243524815876096 2020-12-11 11:51:15 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> "All the big corporations are run by bugmen that put poison in our products to make us sick. Except for Big Tobacco and cigarette companies, those guys are totally looking out for our best interests!"-Most right-wingers
1337242391393275904 2020-12-11 11:46:45 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Augustu69731916 @Pius_Vindex They were fascinated by the celestial bodies they observed which includes the Moon, Mars, Saturn, etc. Dante romanticized them in Paradiso as well. Obviously the Reddit nihilist view of space is dumb but that reflects their own nature, not the nature of space itself.
1337238061843931137 2020-12-11 11:29:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> The Left could start embracing monarchy, weightlifting, organ meat, you name it, and a large chunk of right-wingers would start promoting the opposite just to be contrarian. Most people on both sides are stuck in meme logic and cannot look at anything with more nuance than that.
1337237152313319424 2020-12-11 11:25:56 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> For all the posturing that the Right does about refusing to be controlled by the Left, the Left still has complete indirect control over most right-winger's beliefs. All the Left has to do is promote or enjoy something and the Right will reject it entirely out of spite.
1337236175283773440 2020-12-11 11:22:03 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @BushWarFighter @iEatOrganMeat Nah, just hollow memeing

1337191594517270529 2020-12-11 08:24:54 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @DrDynamis This guy's ego has gotten to where he just says anyone who disagrees with him is "malnourished"
1337190728225656832 2020-12-11 08:21:28 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @DeVoCompagnie Yep, Machiavelli as well. Order does not exist unless you have the power to enforce it
1337188143578165248 2020-12-11 08:11:11 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I think the common theme in fiction of the hero choosing not to kill someone who murdered his family/friends because "revenge is never the answer" is propaganda meant to pacify you and make you more ok with being abused. Justice is important and it's up to us to enact it.
1337180133137002497 2020-12-11 07:39:22 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @MMAnarchist @not_devy Imagine needing a substance to have fun

1337163183233044481 2020-12-11 06:32:00 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Imagine being unable to criticize government power grabs with anything more original than "That's exactly what da NAZIS did when they took power!"
1337159990386302976 2020-12-11 06:19:19 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Augustu69731916 @not_devy Caffeine does not cause withdrawal to that extent, I take no caffeine days/weeks all the time, but it is true that caffeine is a bad addiction for many people, must be done in moderation
1337159485396295681 2020-12-11 06:17:19 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Augustu69731916 @not_devy Nah, big corporations do big corporation things. When something is so addictive that people get withdrawals from going a day without it, I'm gonna say that's a red flag

1337146176836169731 2020-12-11 05:24:26 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @not_devy Have fun with lung cancer and chemical additives
1336879992245022720 2020-12-10 11:46:42 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Kinda disturbing that there are Souls players who level up Vitality
1336869363962540033 2020-12-10 11:04:28 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Augustu69731916 That's true, my point is just that we clearly cannot submit to the Church in the way that our tradition has mandated in the past. Because that era is long gone. Now is the era of the individual, not the collective, as Nietzsche would say
1336868987938992133 2020-12-10 11:02:59 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @WulfHaller You don't have to support the Culture industry to also see the good in space, technology, etc. It's a matter of reclaiming those fields from the anti-life cult that hijacked them.
1336868419661160450 2020-12-10 11:00:43 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Pius_Vindex Yes exactly, it is Man's duty to leave no unknown territory unexplored. We need unique feats of bravery and ingenuity to give our era its own identity among the rest. It would take thousands of years to get there if we forfeit all the knowledge we've gained up to this point
1336852636692320257 2020-12-10 09:58:00 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> So assuming we "go back," be it to medieval times, hunter-gatherer days, or Bronze Age, then what? Do we simply spend the rest of human existence LARPing a bygone era? Permanently stymie all innovation or technology in fear of becoming "modern" again? Do you support entropy?
1336787471565262852 2020-12-10 05:39:04 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Lmao
1336595197065633797 2020-12-09 16:55:02 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @WineUncle Yeah I'm not one of the "Trump is Caesar" people. I like the guys personality in contrast to 99% of politicians but what I fight for lies outside democracy altogether
1336594380434644997 2020-12-09 16:51:47 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Keepitsolar1 @westernbrahmin The Church actually elevated Mary's status in large part to fulfill the pagan converts' needs for a feminine fertility figure
1336524198320234496 2020-12-09 12:12:54 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> At some point you guys are going to need to stop being surprised when corrupt courts do corrupt court things. You really thought you were going to win this through the system? Until you choose to fight Trump will leave the WH in January, lockdowns will never end, the list goes on
1336521220813156352 2020-12-09 12:01:05 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @westernbrahmin Biggest downfall of the Christian mind is the unwillingness to acknowledge the Divine in natural processes, heavenly bodies, etc. Much neglected knowledge there caused by top much transcendentalism
1336520269272330246 2020-12-09 11:57:18 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> This is the most accurate political compass by far.  https://t.co/KNattUb5yu
1336519061195411456 2020-12-09 11:52:30 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @bronzeagemantis No and I'm pretty sure Ares would respect me more for fighting him on it even if I couldn't win
1336515969603268608 2020-12-09 11:40:13 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @wristsnapper Every day my man
1336515898627256320 2020-12-09 11:39:56 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @HerrRintfleisch I've been hearing a lot about blue lotus for sleep, allergies, etc. May need to give that a try tbh
1336514325004115975 2020-12-09 11:33:40 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> It's unhealthy to never have dreams. You need to do something to improve sleep quality if you experience this issue
1336468826490351616 2020-12-09 08:32:53 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @EternalSean @sellyourcloaka1 Yup, the gay pedo scandal is very real but...well you know how that goes
1336467451501043713 2020-12-09 08:27:25 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @sellyourcloaka1 @EternalSean I like Ortho and actually am part of the Church but they can sometimes go too far in trying to demonize Catholics over being salty about the Great Schism
1336467194516004865 2020-12-09 08:26:24 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @sellyourcloaka1 @EternalSean But at the same time Catholic pedo scandal is mostly a nonfactor. There are more teachers abusing students and at least as much Baptist preachers doing the same. It's the age old issue of bad people in power taking advantage of vulnerable subjects. Nothing exclusive to Catholics
1336466719288795137 2020-12-09 08:24:30 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @sellyourcloaka1 @EternalSean I would say that the Augustinian idea of celibacy being the best possible life is very dangerous and rejects Eros as a crucial part of human consciousness. So it's not too far off the mark
1336465895594602497 2020-12-09 08:21:14 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @ZoomerBronzeage Exactly. People get blackpilled over 5g, pollution etc, and the concerns are valid. But many also forget that the human body has adapted to ice ages, deserts, you name it. You are always capable of tapping into that adaptability
1336465174249807872 2020-12-09 08:18:22 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @ZoomerBronzeage Biohacking is very real and a yuge whitepill
1336460498888519682 2020-12-09 07:59:47 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> The idea that literally everything modernity has produced is devoid of spirit,and therefore to be rejected, is pathetic and assumes that God is not always working to bring opportunities for growth even in the darkest of times.
1336324648795951113 2020-12-08 22:59:58 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Not sure if Junger's intention was to make me wish I could fight in WW1 but it's working either way
1336323498701033477 2020-12-08 22:55:24 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @spriggan2000 Great choice, I love Symposium
1336279266200346627 2020-12-08 19:59:38 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @bdomenech I favor China-level restrictions on US citizens.
1336232044926562305 2020-12-08 16:52:00 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Modern people: Dude modern money is so dumb lol. It's just like, paper! That stuff is worthless without the value we give it!  Lycurgus:*doses red-hot iron currency with vinegar to make it useless for anything but denoting value*
1336230814875574276 2020-12-08 16:47:06 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @DrutangAtHome Even if the vaccine is 100% safe idc, it's about the principle. You can't force me to put something in my body, especially over a disease with no real threat to 99.9% of the population that you literally ruined people's lives over.
1336154513657524226 2020-12-08 11:43:55 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Many such cases. Get better philosophers!  https://t.co/id8zLH5lYW

1336124165590544386 2020-12-08 09:43:19 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Any updates on Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's connections, Notre Dame fires, etc? Or do we retire media issues that don't get resolved before the next Netflix premiere?
1336102625805299712 2020-12-08 08:17:44 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @_forest_seeker_ Yes exactly, as with anything the inability to let things go is ground zero for neurosis
1336101704660561920 2020-12-08 08:14:04 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> This has always been the true agenda of the widespread "mental health" rhetoric. You saw it with Kanye. These people want to lock you up and pump you full of sedatives for wrongthink under the guise of benevolence and compassion.
1336093930195214341 2020-12-08 07:43:11 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> But in today's world, where art has been commoditized,drained of spirit, we are not given a proper canvas on which to project our inner contents. We do not have a culture imbued with vital spirit like Bach, Michaelangelo, etc did. But we must find a way to overcome the entropy.
1336093326571950081 2020-12-08 07:40:47 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I feel that this is what every artist experiences when he gets a wave of inspiration. He comes into contact with a Platonic Form in the aether within himself and thus sets out to pull it into the "real" world, in as close to that perfect condition as possible.
1336092832323473409 2020-12-08 07:38:49 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I find it difficult at times to finish my musics because deep within me I feel as if I am grasping for something never heard before. I want to make something aristocratic and revolutionary just as the likes of Bach did in their time. But actualizing this in reality is hard
1336091375624970248 2020-12-08 07:33:01 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Spinachbrah Is not bad when sauted with some coco oil and garlic tho
1336090651977519104 2020-12-08 07:30:09 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @sellyourcloaka1 Oh it definitely is. I literally make rap style music so I have to like it lmao. Most of the hate for it is a reactionary thing because lefties like it
1336089923481444354 2020-12-08 07:27:15 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @sellyourcloaka1 Tbh lyrically it has the most poetic potential out of any genre, it's just misused 99% of the time
1336088215560843273 2020-12-08 07:20:28 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Same goes for using the gym yoga class white girls to discredit Eastern spirituality. Be better than that, life is more than just memes
1336087936580907008 2020-12-08 07:19:22 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Using the soy-faced neopagan LARPers to discredit paganism as a whole is no better than using Joel Osteen/Hillsong to discredit Christianity.
1336087034667159552 2020-12-08 07:15:47 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @_forest_seeker_ Yes, seems hatred can be just a general feeling towards someone in a vacuum, whereas resentment is hating someone and letting that hate seep into other areas of your life, letting it negatively affect you as a person
1335800107229384705 2020-12-07 12:15:38 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Finally beat Hades for the first time last night and I am even firmer in stanning it for GOTY. Highly recommend, excellent indie game with endless replayability
1335777272108867584 2020-12-07 10:44:53 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Augustu69731916 Like the Hard mode of kegels
1335777070530650113 2020-12-07 10:44:05 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral A lot of stuff, much of it over my head since I'm not a huge econ guy, but a lot to do w/ central banks always bailing out countries by issuing more currency instead of actually addressing the sources of economic strife,slapping band aids on an increasingly infected wound
1335775764407607298 2020-12-07 10:38:54 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @limitlessbur I really can't tell with any of these people anymore
1335775402980225024 2020-12-07 10:37:28 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral 100%. You have to read him to understand the mind in any sort of scientific fashion. He was impactful for a reason. I hate George Soros but that doesn't mean I can't admit he was mostly correct about where our economy was headed
1335774938867896321 2020-12-07 10:35:37 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral Absolutely, it's funny how somehow modernity found a way to build a whole field of psychoanalysis with Freud as the foundation, yet still managed to leave out how all neurosis arises from some form of personal trauma/insecurity that was to be dealt with, not numbed up with SSRIs
1335773900840562693 2020-12-07 10:31:30 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral Was correct in a lot of his theories and in many ways unearthed the unconscious side of the mind to the public. But interpretation of those truths tended to be kinda pathetic. I feel Jung took most of the good in his theories while omitting most of the materialism and other tripe
1335773200668618752 2020-12-07 10:28:43 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral Yeah but Freud was the biggest figure in advancing that movement on the psychological front
1335768637769134082 2020-12-07 10:10:35 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @KolonialBarbar Dedicate to the theme at least 😂

1335743432623611906 2020-12-07 08:30:25 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @LandsharkRides I literally wouldn't have sex if I were at war. Death is my mistress and she is very jealous
1335743130658869250 2020-12-07 08:29:13 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Most overlooked parts of fitness: -Grip strength -Single leg/single arm strength  -Isometrics, especially overcoming and ballistic  -Pliability   Many others but those are a few that immediately come to mind.
1335736967489859590 2020-12-07 08:04:44 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> This sport is such a joke lmao
1335734686707027968 2020-12-07 07:55:40 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Warriormonk_01 @princetidus_ That's very good. Lifting is also crucial imo but I think it's better to lift more for functionality and athleticism than physique. If you only do gym movements you'll only be good in the gym. You'll rarely be in perfect form bench press position on the battlefield

1335047918521380864 2020-12-05 10:26:42 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Currently plotting a way to translate Der Kampf als inneres Erlebnis by Jünger into English. I know German but not quite fluidly enough to just sit down and read a whole book. Really want to read this one though.

1335008578076291073 2020-12-05 07:50:22 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Tried kava last night. Interesting substance. Very mild yet noticeable buzz. Could be a good alcoholic substitute for those who want to similate having a couple drinks without the health downsides. Tastes awful though
1335001689460510721 2020-12-05 07:23:00 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Grimhood What about sprouted grains particularly? I've cut most grains out of my life but read good things about sprouted. Do those have the same issues?
1334988641320513536 2020-12-05 06:31:09 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I'm immune to the bans. My nimbleness is beyond questioning at this point. I will always be here fighting the good fight!
1334887677380988928 2020-12-04 23:49:57 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Also the birds still singing in the trees amidst mortar shellings. Deep, powerful messages in the smallest things. Jünger had a great talent for identifying and describing them

Nature showing total indifference even to an earth-shattering conflict

But I won't do that until I've learned more about it because I really just don't know much about it to be honest lol. I kinda wrote it off back when it first started getting big
1334786132337422336 2020-12-04 17:06:27 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @PierreDeChimpo Been seeing that one a lot, I think I'll give that one a look, thanks friend!
1334745562474819584 2020-12-04 14:25:15 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @AlbionBard glorification of human reason gave way to the nihilistic sense of isolation that the West is still grappling with
1334745373152321536 2020-12-04 14:24:29 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @AlbionBard toxic effects were kept in check to an extent. Whereas your post-Descartes era was a full culmination of those problems Plato and the like stirred up, albeit unintentionally in my opinion. And if course then the curtain was thrown off by the likes of Nietzsche and the optimistic
1334744944481865733 2020-12-04 14:22:47 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @AlbionBard Definitely true. The minute human reason was discovered the seeds for that great disconnect were planted. It was even more apparent in the likes of the Atomists, Sophists, etc back then. But I think that the Greeks as a whole had more mythological vitalism so that most of the

1334739875673890816 2020-12-04 14:02:39 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @AlbionBard Much of 19th-century philosophy is to blame unfortunately. The prevailing idea of the supremacy of material science and human logic leaked into areas it never belonged. Your Humes, Kants and the like, though Kant at least was trying to keep the idea you're expressing alive.
1334738946375507969 2020-12-04 13:58:57 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Pius_Vindex @wineandammo They just equate living anywhere on or near the African continent as being "black" which is ironically really ignorant and, dare I say, racist itself. Same reason they will die on the hill that ancient Egyptians were black despite blonde/red haired mummies and other things

1334736303624253441 2020-12-04 13:48:27 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Twitter friends-what is the best site for blogging nowadays? I did WordPress way back when but it seems like the "trap" option with how popular it is.
1334736022308057088 2020-12-04 13:47:20 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Warriormonk_01 Nah, I really should do that, but honestly I don't do a whole lot of big threads, usually just tweets or small ones comprising like 2-3 tweets. But I will likely start a blog or something soon so I can have my thoughts out there in a more organized way
1334735664143880192 2020-12-04 13:45:55 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Warriormonk_01 @alt1na1 in response to the shakiness of things like stocks, gold, etc. But I really am undereducated on it rn and need to research more. I was a huge skeptic in the past but may have been very wrong about it
1334735388800393219 2020-12-04 13:44:49 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Warriormonk_01 @alt1na1 some of the things I've read about the sheer mystery of market behavior (recommend Alchemy of Finance by Soros) just makes me wary of putting a whole lot into it now. I'm starting to get more interest in crypto as it's a more international form of currency and has risen

I only ever did/do long term holds, I don't like gambling with things like day trading. But the uncertainty of our country as a whole going forward and

1334721182143287308 2020-12-04 12:48:22 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I have organically undergone the same spiritual journey as Zarathustra, and did so long before I even read his words.
1334720875212451841 2020-12-04 12:47:09 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Same goes with watering down my message to make others feel more comfortable. If you can't understand it or feel it's too "harsh" then it isn't meant for you. Tired of leading horses to water only to watch them die of thirst our of sheer stubbornness.
1334720474224484352 2020-12-04 12:45:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I've long since given up on expending any significant amount of effort trying to convince normies to take the very simple steps required to reach greatness. You can follow my advice and become a demigod or wallow in your own dirt bed for the rest of your life. Doesn't affect me!

1334696437322571776 2020-12-04 11:10:02 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> At this point anyone who lets their children watch mainstream television is committing child abuse. A lot of "conservatives" out there guilty of this.

1334642898831335424 2020-12-04 07:37:18 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @rahkonihr Obviously not. At least not until they converted. The point is that their rape and pillaging of Christians infused their good genes with the greater population of mainland Europe, which proved crucial in the Europeans' ability to stave off invasion of the various Eastern hordes
1334639594743230464 2020-12-04 07:24:10 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @BasedPhilostrat @_purepoison @nemomihinomen Socrates is a character invented by Plato

1334621949113356288 2020-12-04 06:14:03 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> If this were universally true I never would have reached the physical shape I'm in, read as much as I do, meditated daily, etc. Free will is stronger than environment when used properly, it's just that 99% of people don't do it.
1334617840834523137 2020-12-04 05:57:43 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @thad_aescendent But that also goes to say, free will can be stronger than environment for a select few, like me.
1334617666175332353 2020-12-04 05:57:02 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @thad_aescendent Unfortunately for many people the only solution is to get in a room by yourself and grind, because you have to be extremely lucky to be surrounded by people motivated to achieve their full potential in body, mind and spirit.

1334338373079736321 2020-12-03 11:27:13 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Say whatever you want about the rape&amp;pillaging side of war, but had the Vikings not done it, Christianity would have been eradicated by the Muslims. You don't have to like war but don't try to scrutinize it with a decadent moral system created by pedophilic sociopaths
1334337567517454336 2020-12-03 11:24:01 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @hyperboriankiwi The chemical imbalance thing has literally never been proven, and was originally propagated by antidepressant companies. It's bunk. Chemical imbalance is the symptom not the cause

1334319562758778881 2020-12-03 10:12:28 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @botfrances_ Actually yeah those things will go a long way to helping it. Cry more
1334294041958211586 2020-12-03 08:31:04 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> But tbf even in my dream I felt guilty due to PUFAs, read the ingredients list on the back, and threw it away after having a couple. So that was pretty cool
1334293832230383619 2020-12-03 08:30:14 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Had a dream last night that they made a new flavor of Doritos and I was curious enough to open a bag and try a few. Damn that was terrifying.
1334286185636769794 2020-12-03 07:59:51 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Not saying that any of those things can't be safely used in moderation, but any reason you have for hating weed also necessitates rejecting those other things as well.
1334285851174563840 2020-12-03 07:58:31 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Call it Reddit all you want but nicotine and tobacco are far more addictive. Dip and cigs DO cause lung and mouth cancer. They're far more regulated by govt and big corporations, and thus have way more chemical additives. Excess alcohol causes far more health issues as well.
1334285288827478019 2020-12-03 07:56:17 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Much of the far right likes to take the reactionary response to anything remotely associated with the Left, including a Reagan/Nixon-era take on marijuana. Using too much of it is bad news, as with any mind-altering substance. But sorry, nicotine, tobacco and alcohol are worse.
1334278921647480832 2020-12-03 07:30:59 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @sovereignfamily That generation directly presided over the erosion of cultural values which made marriage much less practical. So both sides have a point, sorry.
1334268944295866375 2020-12-03 06:51:20 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Gonna venture to say I'm likely the only one in America with this  https://t.co/Yb3ubZqM4w

1334235824125321216 2020-12-03 04:39:44 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral leached away by bureaucrats because they cling to the hope of "voting them out" instead of taking action. They'd have no such delusions under an emperor, and would actually do the job they claimed to be doing with democracy.
1334235252999540738 2020-12-03 04:37:27 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral Whereas in a democratic state of today's variety, people are sedated with a false sense of power via the voting system, courts, etc. Even though those things have proven to be just as corrupt as the worst monarchs were. Thus they continue to allow more and more freedoms to be
1334234745610366977 2020-12-03 04:35:26 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral There's no reliance on the law, because legally the king holds all the leverage and can't be "voted out." Hence why many a king has met his end at the hands of an angry mob.
1334234369398018054 2020-12-03 04:33:57 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral True. I've begun to come around to a theory that when you give people less power, they actually end up having more. In a monarchy or any system where the ruler holds most of the power, the citizens know that if they get a Nero, the only recourse will be to stop him by force.
1334073047767257088 2020-12-02 17:52:55 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Augustu69731916 Hell, at this point I think I'd take the mob back. Al Capone was kinda based

1334070397633957893 2020-12-02 17:42:23 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Augustu69731916 I can get on board with that, the oceans are less explored than space at this point
1334060396957872128 2020-12-02 17:02:38 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @memeticide @LandsharkRides We already have the Futurist Manifesto
1333989333913776130 2020-12-02 12:20:16 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Be extremely wary of any major theory that was made in the 19th century
1333974554167881739 2020-12-02 11:21:32 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Highly recommend stinging nettle for those who suffer from allergies and want to avoid all the negative effects of synthetic medications. I've found it more potent when brewed as a tea

1333971603684724736 2020-12-02 11:09:48 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Pius_Vindex We have to boldly march into the Void
1333969575126441984 2020-12-02 11:01:45 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> This extends to other fields with social elements, such as economics and, to a lesser extent, ecology. These cannot be reliably understood by the scientific method
1333968912166375424 2020-12-02 10:59:07 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Social science is not a real field. The name itself is an oxymoron
1333945725370183682 2020-12-02 09:26:59 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> At this point I'm fully convinced that the minute you get into the Hollywood elite class you're practically forced to consume pharmaceuticals and a variety of drugs until you're all but lobotomize
1333942495840006146 2020-12-02 09:14:09 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral Democracy can work with a healthy dose of monarchy/aristocracy, but in a vacuum it denies natural hierarchies and pays dearly for it. I basically share Plato's Five Regimes take more or less
1333942022370185223 2020-12-02 09:12:16 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral I suppose it depends what type of democracy for me. If we're talking  ancient Greek democracy with an emperor and an aristocracy based on noble ideals then yes. But what we have defined as democracy from the Magna Carta onward was destined to fail imo. Mob rule waiting to happen
1333941406558253057 2020-12-02 09:09:49 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @LegacyFuel Welcome to women
1333916530367664130 2020-12-02 07:30:58 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Thanks, I hate it
1333913439224422405 2020-12-02 07:18:41 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @AOC if you're gonna stream do a real game and face me in Smash Bros. Don't be a coward, this is your chance to stick it to the far right
1333912890739404800 2020-12-02 07:16:30 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Plutarch is next but I changed my mind on the other book, going to read Storm of Steel as well
1333887898261852161 2020-12-02 05:37:12 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Never understood why people lie about reading, working out, or eating healthy. Really sad to value others' opinions of you over your own development. Either get better or be real about who you are.
1333872285225201672 2020-12-02 04:35:09 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @bartsimsonreal Well that is true, they don't want you to see that as a possibility, they want to sedate not empower
1333871852779933699 2020-12-02 04:33:26 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @bartsimsonreal I get where you're coming from but I'd say people fighting against the stagnacy of our culture to become physically, mentally or spiritually healthy and finding purpose is "feel good." There's always something to strive for
1333869392355061760 2020-12-02 04:23:39 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @DejaRu22 Nah, I was never a coomer to that extent, I had sport to train for but also just a deeper motivation to be as powerful as I could possibly be. But hey whatever gets people exercising, as long as they eventually find a better reason than "It'll get me laid."
1333868244621430784 2020-12-02 04:19:06 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Gespenstlin Ah you're right, my bad lol
1333867198528577536 2020-12-02 04:14:56 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> You want to "retvrn to monke" yet monke is trying to move forward and evolve. Even your beloved animal mascot thinks you're an escapist!
1333866713637658624 2020-12-02 04:13:01 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Gespenstlin Hate to be that guy but Evola didn't want to "retvrn" to anything
1333695163047276544 2020-12-01 16:51:20 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> It's kinda crazy how Jaws memed multiple generations into an irrational fear of giant sea monsters attacking them at the beach  https://t.co/DjVg9Ms26u
1333614961843691521 2020-12-01 11:32:38 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Augustu69731916 It was likely gonna happen even without the poll, got Sparta ready to go and will be ordering more in near future
1333613158108450823 2020-12-01 11:25:28 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @AmericanThad Blueberry
1333582804773445632 2020-12-01 09:24:52 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Finished Urth last weekend, wrapping up Alchemy of Finance this week, what should I read next? Will probably choose two at a time.
1333580694543626240 2020-12-01 09:16:28 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @HerrRintfleisch I'm currently in my late 20s, close to 30, and am better physically than I've ever been. Feel like I'm not even close to slowing down either. Age is just an excuse until you're at least in upper 30s lol
1333565919189229568 2020-12-01 08:17:46 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral Tbh I believe multiverse theory in that every possibility truly exists in its own reality even if we don't physically experience it as more than a thought.
1333565262185066497 2020-12-01 08:15:09 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> It's simple: either you're reading and filling your brain with information of your choosing, or you're allowing the herd to fill your brain for you. You will just turn into a product of your surroundings unless you give yourself something more.
1333563671549718528 2020-12-01 08:08:50 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> At some point conservatives are going to have to find something better than "That's exactly what the NAZIS did when they took power!" to criticize the Left's actions. Gross oversimplification &amp; it also implies the Right is incapable of forming a point outside of the MSM narrative
1333548015982882824 2020-12-01 07:06:37 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> As the temperature starts to drop, it's a great idea to continue meditating outside with minimal clothing. Great way to improve the body's resistance to the cold, and to teach yourself to sit with discomfort.
1333540508904415233 2020-12-01 06:36:47 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Not all "dictators" are equal. Modern oligarchs wish for a population too weak/stupid/apathetic to challenge them. Emperors like Hadrian, Caesar etc wanted a population full of vitality that only lets the worthy rule. They didn't fear competition. Huge gap in virtue there.
1333537530835329026 2020-12-01 06:24:57 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> If I were someone who wanted to seize power and enslave the people, the last thing I'd do is let the leverage that COVID brings slip away. I promise you the lockdowns, mask laws, curfews etc will never stop unless we make them stop.
1333534188688052224 2020-12-01 06:11:41 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Honestly people being on autopilot is probably my biggest pet peeve nowadays.
1333516422329327617 2020-12-01 05:01:05 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> It at least takes a solid 30 min of discipline to do a workout, but if you can't turn autopilot off long enough to just breathe deeply for a few minutes, just admit you aren't trying
1333513531111641089 2020-12-01 04:49:35 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Make excuses not to eat healthy, exercise, etc all you want, but there's literally zero reason not to work on breathing properly at least. You can literally practice that anywhere.
1333251083095990273 2020-11-30 11:26:43 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> If they're allowed to double down on  this big of a blunder, what can't they double down on going forward?
1333250586591055872 2020-11-30 11:24:45 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Insane that so many people think it's as simple as "The lockdown failed to stop COVID because people didn't lock down or wear masks enough." Most of the population did those things, so why would cases still go up? Hubris prevents them from admitting lockdowns were proven useless
1333219154892103682 2020-11-30 09:19:51 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @ellobosalvaje Dude has a pretty strict diet and training regimen
1333212821908303878 2020-11-30 08:54:41 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @ellobosalvaje Eh, false. This was true maybe in older time periods but in today's age just avoiding most of the poison is going to qualify as a "strict diet." You may be able to avoid the downsides while young but it will catch up to you. Happens to most pro athletes as well
1333208586873344000 2020-11-30 08:37:51 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Easiest way to lose my respect is to prove you have no fight in you. Fight is what we will need the most to get through what's coming.
1333207303944855555 2020-11-30 08:32:45 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @gaitanalyst I had a dream I was at a serpent festival, there were anacondas literally everywhere. At one point there was a tree just covered in them. Powerful omens
1333205714886676480 2020-11-30 08:26:26 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @DeVoCompagnie @east_indie_t I've noticed that in cerebral games like that sometimes a break works wonders. Allows whatever you've learned to "soak in"
1333205403648331783 2020-11-30 08:25:12 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Idc what anyone says, I'm rooting for Hades to win GOTY. Excellent game, insane that it's actually nominated
1332902222104027136 2020-11-29 12:20:28 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> My ideology has resulted in a strong body, high IQ, and endless motivation. Why would I ever give one that hasn't any serious consideration?
1332546018454495233 2020-11-28 12:45:02 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Dippers: "Daily tobacco raises testosterone bro."  Also dippers: *get mouth cancer*
1332544148042342400 2020-11-28 12:37:37 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> If you can sit on your bed/chair and phone scroll, nap and veg all day, you can do the same and read a book. 10 pages a day to start, it really isn't hard.
1332543478904053760 2020-11-28 12:34:57 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I try to keep a rule to not use my bedroom for anything except sleeping. I do my studying, gaming, etc in other spaces. Can become too easy to just hide away in my room and be lazy. Plus I find it improves the energy of the room.
1332440124580392962 2020-11-28 05:44:15 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @bull_leaper Yes
1332433203819376643 2020-11-28 05:16:45 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> It's astonishing how much of the population is nihilist, even if not in name. Many have no line in the sand to draw when it comes to freedom, and will fall in line for their media overlords no matter how godless and depraved they prove to be.
1332189332963258368 2020-11-27 13:07:42 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> They don't want you together with family for Thanksgiving but they still want you Black Friday shopping
1332099979805077505 2020-11-27 07:12:39 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @SolBrah I often use maca with lemon juice, turmeric and black pepper for this, potent stuff
1332099498701705225 2020-11-27 07:10:44 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Daily_Benoist Unfortunately many Christians use the Tower of Babel story to imply that racial/cultural divisions are to be seen in a negative light as a punishment for Man's hubris. This makes it much easier to make globohomo melting pot politics as a heroic "redemption" for Man
1332079234769149960 2020-11-27 05:50:13 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Oh, well that settles it folks! Pro-life has been destroyed.
1332078984784474117 2020-11-27 05:49:13 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @an_angel_named My cat gets nothing but organ meat from the farmer's market like the alpha predator he is
1332067491435180033 2020-11-27 05:03:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @GirthyHagen The same reason these dudes want a gf so badly is the same reason they can't get one
1332056239493304324 2020-11-27 04:18:50 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> "I'm not a sheep but other people are and I don't wanna shatter their illusion."
1332056092046716935 2020-11-27 04:18:15 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> "I wear a mask because other people are really scared and I just don't want to upset them." Imagine structuring your life around what the most media-indoctrinated people do lmao
1332045936646893570 2020-11-27 03:37:54 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @LindyFit One armed bent press for supreme chads
1332033878031171585 2020-11-27 02:49:59 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> It seems to be a very mainstream Christian thing to substitute discipline for morality.
1331828510034440192 2020-11-26 13:13:55 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> "Do you know what it is to train your will until it is like a bar of iron? To drive your spirit before you like a slave? To toil ceaselessly for an end that may never come, a prize so remote that it seems it will never come?"
1331824697860886528 2020-11-26 12:58:46 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @MunkusMonkey It just seems like such a weird waste of energy. Probably a misery loves company thing
1331824563248918529 2020-11-26 12:58:14 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @MunkusMonkey What's even the point of people doing these things? Like even if you don't enjoy the food that much what is there to gain in ruining it for others?
1331822547151822849 2020-11-26 12:50:13 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Pablo could have made Columbia great again
1331820867186208773 2020-11-26 12:43:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Mandela was nearly identical in his life path to Pablo Escobar. The only difference is how the global narrative painted him.
1331809313980096519 2020-11-26 11:57:38 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @hrgsprgz Coding very good, you can do a lot with it, could result in a source of income that makes 4HL unnecessary
1331775486360424448 2020-11-26 09:43:13 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Uhhh Big Sean based??
1331696295514402816 2020-11-26 04:28:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @YoungEmissary They nominated it for like 10 categories lmao
1331696170591252484 2020-11-26 04:28:03 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @YoungEmissary I dont even get how it was nominated for anything, didn't they literally have to disable reviews because of how much negative press they got? Totally manufactured buzz for a game more than I've ever seen
1331695453210103812 2020-11-26 04:25:12 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @YoungEmissary Hades needs to win GOTY
1331513740961968128 2020-11-25 16:23:08 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @spriggan2000 @euphoricsikkunt Thats actually one of the things that made me start thinking this
1331508517052833793 2020-11-25 16:02:23 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> These people have become so devoid of feeling that they revel in their inability to experience life without deconstructing it into a materialist void. Plus science shows animals feel MUCH more than we thought due to early scientists' anthrocentric standards for intelligence.
1331504821287972864 2020-11-25 15:47:42 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Very strong chance that outer space is the realm of the dead. The river Styx itself, this is the conclusion I am coming around to.
1331457099403042821 2020-11-25 12:38:04 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Augustu69731916 Thanks a lot man! Good to see you are recovering, was wondering what happened with that wreck. How is that going?
1331448120253747200 2020-11-25 12:02:23 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Finally did the 6x20 squats as part of leg&amp;core day. B L O W N  U P
1331447407276650497 2020-11-25 11:59:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @kobegatsby For me I always appreciated nervousness because with sufficient prowess in inner alchemy one can convert the raw nervous energy into intensity to perform
1331444768795217920 2020-11-25 11:49:04 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @an_angel_named Isabelle is the breed of canine best adapted to live in the modern world and hold an office job
1331444524485402626 2020-11-25 11:48:06 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @TheBodhisattva4 Many such cases, we are a dying breed but will resurrect soon...

1331383538067910656 2020-11-25 07:45:46 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> There is no reason the average citizen shouldn't be able to: -Exercise 3-5x a week -Read 10 books a year  -Meditate daily -Go a week without eating/drinking unhealthy garbage  None of these are hard, you're just lazy.
1331363658807566336 2020-11-25 06:26:46 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @LandsharkRides Depends how often you do it. If you're constantly around people who give you bad food you should either get better friends or refuse it sometimes, but once in a while is fine
1331354290460438539 2020-11-25 05:49:32 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @realDonaldTrump (!) Sources dispute this claim
1330976436434456580 2020-11-24 04:48:05 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> The true face of the blackpilling on this side of the political spectrum is that many of you aren't as willing to rebel as you pretend to be. You still watch porn, use Tinder, take pharmaceuticals like Adderall, eat garbage food, watch lamestream TV, etc, and it affects you.
1330975687520423941 2020-11-24 04:45:06 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> "There's nothing we can do." Actually you can do a lot. Get/keep yourself in good shape. Learn to shoot a gun and stock up on ammo. Get your kids out of public schools. Form your own community as separate from mainstream culture as possible and be ready to defend if necessary
1330973174956240896 2020-11-24 04:35:07 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> This kind of defeatist rhetoric is what keeps the right wing down. There should be no place for this in our corner.
1330970557161017352 2020-11-24 04:24:43 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Unconditional love is not the same as unconditional respect. Respect has to be earned, it cannot be given.
1330969900974809090 2020-11-24 04:22:07 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @BasedPhilostrat Halfway through Urth of the New Sun then I'll be finished. Might be new favorite fantasy series
1330968925455126532 2020-11-24 04:18:14 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @BasedPhilostrat Book of the New Sun for fiction
1330697263270793218 2020-11-23 10:18:45 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> The sheet banality and dispassion of "normal" discourse is more radicalizing than anything else.
1330696647484076038 2020-11-23 10:16:18 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> What's funny is I didn't make this account with any intentions of posting far-right content. I just tweeted my opinions on things like fitness/nutrition, aesthetic beauty, tradition, history, etc. The far right is simply the only group those topics resonate with. Says a lot!
1330613785510424577 2020-11-23 04:47:02 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @HaveBigPenis Yeah, there's really nothing wrong with using it for fun in moderation, in fact it does have less adverse effects than alcohol, cigs etc. But acting like smoking a joint is some kind of brain boosting Limitless pill is cringe
1330607260842795010 2020-11-23 04:21:07 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @1_beresheet Nicotine and tobacco too
1330606962518732800 2020-11-23 04:19:56 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @hyperboriankiwi Many such cases, but those who can't go without nicotine for a week are pretty weak too
1330367495614701571 2020-11-22 12:28:22 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> At some point you guys are gonna need to stop being surprised when mainstream media personalities end up being turncoats.
1330267265930027013 2020-11-22 05:50:06 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Pretty much everyone complaining about 2020 has done nothing to ensure 2021 will be better for them
1330000723938062336 2020-11-21 12:10:57 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Something very symbolically powerful about  lifting the heavy weight off your shoulders and feeling like gravity has weakened as you do your regular exercises. Allows you to do what was once difficult with ease because it no longer intimidates you.
1329999811693645832 2020-11-21 12:07:19 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Combining sources of weighted resistance,such as weight vest+sandbag, might be the best overall body workout you can do. Teaches many noble lessons.
1329990727351341057 2020-11-21 11:31:14 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Even if the Democrats hadn't cheated this election (which they did), it wouldn't change what I want Trump to do at all. I hate the Hollywood cult, and I want to see them lose. It's that simple, I don't care what the rules are.
1329919255085805579 2020-11-21 06:47:13 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> How does it take you 30 hrs per month to cook your own meals lmao

1329876937628655621 2020-11-21 03:59:04 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @edannunziata Wish they used a healthier model.
1329873771403112454 2020-11-21 03:46:29 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> You talking mad sh🐺t for someone within Poppy distance  https://t.co/qjGoSv0S7B
1329860889248469000 2020-11-21 02:55:18 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Yes it is. I'd wipe the entire concept of democracy from history to stroke my own ego and I won't apologize for this.
1329860403917107203 2020-11-21 02:53:22 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Winning with style is as important as winning itself. Anything can be a work of art when done aesthetically
1329854797466525697 2020-11-21 02:31:05 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @AetiusRF The army didn't deserve my athleticism and willpower. I'm premium goods and will only be used for noble conflicts
1329853580598276099 2020-11-21 02:26:15 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @hyperboriankiwi Pit mains rise up
1329833948378173442 2020-11-21 01:08:15 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Interesting coincidence that these people will give you moral lectures on your politics and philosophy, but they also can't go a week without announcing how existentially miserable they are. Maybe I'll give your opinions a second thought when you don't want to die.
1329825881204854784 2020-11-21 00:36:11 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Normies automatically assume that anyone with above average intelligence got it from podcasts
1329690870447284224 2020-11-20 15:39:42 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> It's pointless to discount intelligence over its misuse in today's era. Intelligence is its own virtue with it own pros and cons, and there's no reason one cannot pursue it while also embodying the courage, discipline, etc of the old heroes &amp; warriors.
1329654723234979841 2020-11-20 13:16:04 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> So where are my Tucker 2024 people at?
1329653360446803968 2020-11-20 13:10:39 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @mayconcmY @jairbolsonaro He's a great man, respect him
1329627486259474432 2020-11-20 11:27:50 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> It's really simple when you think about it: I'm jacked, I'm handsome, I'm intelligent, my charisma is through the roof, and I cannot be contained by anyone. Try to see things my way!

1329537831837065216 2020-11-20 05:31:35 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Any Christian who doubles down on the "logic/individualism/anything outside the Church is bad" dogmatism is repeating the behavior that led to the Enlightenment in the first place. It will be your fault if the faith is not restored.

1329260052922986498 2020-11-19 11:07:47 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> It likely won't be immediate. At first people will simply celebrate their cancelled debt and possibly not see any consequences for the next few years. But it will come. Maybe gas prices spike, maybe taxes increase, either way at some point the bankers will have to equalize it.
1329248062091517952 2020-11-19 10:20:08 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I know this is kinda beating a dead horse but if Biden does "cancel student debt" that's likely going to require a bailout of some sort, probably from a central bank, and that toll will come due at some point. Anyone with a brain knows that toll will be paid by the citizens.
1329224346045452296 2020-11-19 08:45:54 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @kaschuta The influence of Sethianism and its ilk throughout Western history, and its culmination in the "secularist" transhumanism agenda
1329223326066225159 2020-11-19 08:41:51 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> You could say this about many "man-made" systems though. Did we really "make" these things or did they influence us from the aether to actualize them?
1329222850952241154 2020-11-19 08:39:58 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> The history of finance in the world is in large part a story of cunning men trying to assert control over various factors in an attempt to bend the flow of currency to their will, and realizing it's more complex than anyone realizes. Soros' discourses on reflexivity show this
1329222283811041280 2020-11-19 08:37:42 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> The behavior of currency is so apocryphal the more you learn about it. I believe it's an entity with a life of its own. There is no man/men who totally control things like credit, stock market, currency values, etc. They react to it more than they influence it at this point.
1329205487913619466 2020-11-19 07:30:58 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Adaption is the biggest factor in survival/evolution, and we are at the top of the food chain for a reason. Trust in what got is this far.
1329205224196743181 2020-11-19 07:29:55 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Take an organ complex and a magnesium supplement. Get sunlight daily. Exercise. Manage stress via meditation. Turn off all blue lights before bed or wear protective goggles (they're $10). It's really not hard. Your body will take care of you if you take care of it.
1329204459042430977 2020-11-19 07:26:53 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Grimhood Also have dabbled in light progesterone supplementation due to its balancing effects on the thyroid. Usually only do so in response to higher cortisol though
1329203773345030144 2020-11-19 07:24:09 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> The possibility of EMF/Wifi/5G interfering with your body's processes shouldn't really change anything you're doing (assuming you're living a properly healthy lifestyle) nor should it blackpill you. The body's ability to adapt is superhuman when properly fueled
1329203166253035520 2020-11-19 07:21:44 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Grimhood To this point though, do you believe that with a diet rich in all the necessary nutrients, proper exercise, sunlight, hormonal therapy etc one can cancel out the detrimental effects of EMF entirely? I believe in the body's ability to adapt if given proper fuel to do so
1329202740514459652 2020-11-19 07:20:03 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Grimhood This is one of many reasons I have been overdosing on things like magnesium, organ complex etc in addition to the possibility of our bodies' nutrient absorption being hindered by a myriad of other factors.
1329160625386377216 2020-11-19 04:32:42 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @JoseppeFranzese He could really capture one of the most archetypal journeys of our era if so, just needs to walk that path and document the experience
1329160130370433027 2020-11-19 04:30:44 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @JoseppeFranzese Will need to read Wright letters though, seems very interesting and I've really neglected his work despite hearing great things
1329159444555571207 2020-11-19 04:28:00 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @JoseppeFranzese Agreed, especially in postmodern age where the only contemporary examples you have are the hornt jesters you mentioned, he's talented on the base level but he's a victim of this era to the extreme. No one sanctified to look up to
1329156294943645697 2020-11-19 04:15:29 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @JoseppeFranzese Yeah that's the one thing I'll give him, at least he recognizes that his current nature is deplorable enough to be self-loathing. Perhaps one day he will summon the will to pull himself out of it
1329154879722549255 2020-11-19 04:09:52 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @JoseppeFranzese Blocked him, his writings are possibly the worst I've ever seen an adult male compose. Coomer whining that completely go against any far right ideals
1329152395067199488 2020-11-19 04:00:00 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> If you reject the exploration of space then you reject the same spirit that drove Columbus to sail to the west, Alexander to conquer the world, etc. You are a servant of entropy attempting to shackle humanity to what is already known. Sad!
1328917267543961602 2020-11-18 12:25:41 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Seen insane strength and endurance gains since I increased the frequency of deload weeks in my routine. I'm telling you guys, rest more if you are training intensely
1328912767424794626 2020-11-18 12:07:48 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @GirthyHagen Likely due at least in part to increased blood flow and stimulation

1328888258525351936 2020-11-18 10:30:25 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @YouTube @OsopePatrisse Don't ever promote this on my timeline again. My patience wears thin
1328870420058157059 2020-11-18 09:19:32 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @armstrrng But yeah I get decent quality pasture raised/organic eggs for like $6-$7 for a pack of 18. Doubt I'd do it if it were 10 a dozen
1328870138456760320 2020-11-18 09:18:24 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @armstrrng with good carbs
1328870106454257669 2020-11-18 09:18:17 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @armstrrng I do it as a way to add more quality calories to my diet in an attempt to gain a bit more bulk. Cheaper than the meal replacement shake I used to drink. I also use the eggs with orange juice which is crucial imo. Protein can deplete blood sugar so you gotta replenish and balance
1328866519074410498 2020-11-18 09:04:01 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @armstrrng I'll be honest, some days when I'm less hungry I'll bump it down by just not doing my 6 at the end of the day. But the idea that eating even 1 egg a day is fundamentally bad for you is ridiculous. Many strong peoples ate eggs all the time, they're a superfood
1328863947496284161 2020-11-18 08:53:48 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I know this is unpopular to say but Hardy's Bane was at least just as good as Ledger's Joker. People just identify with Joker as a character more for some reason.

1328859340103688192 2020-11-18 08:35:30 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> If you cut out PUFAs, refined sugar, etc in an attempt to reduce carcinogens but still use cigs or dip daily, you aren't eating healthy to get better. You're eating healthy to cancel out your other bad habits. Not much different from someone who works out so he can eat unhealthy
1328856432918360067 2020-11-18 08:23:57 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> You cannot obtain the same results as someone else by just watching and copying them. "Monkey see, monkey do" doesn't work except for the most basic things. Not enough people realize this.
1328839854680141826 2020-11-18 07:18:04 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Been eating 12 eggs a day, no diabetes yet. How strange!
1328818333320409090 2020-11-18 05:52:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I keep saying this. You get a better, more natural physique when you stop lifting for physique altogether and focus on athleticism

1328555407585972224 2020-11-17 12:27:47 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @MavrosArkouda Leftist coworker was arguing with me over p*litics last weekend, towarda the end of the night he said, and I quote "You're trying to fuel your body, I'm trying to poison mine." All I need to know about someone
1328555099082338305 2020-11-17 12:26:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @MavrosArkouda Yeah, I tried to resist that conclusion but have begun to think that most people we see today indeed have no soul. And true, can't really talk to a leftie without having them casually mention how miserable they are. God is already punishing them.
1328531643301306369 2020-11-17 10:53:21 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @MavrosArkouda "See how ugly/weak/unmotivated I am,and realize I'm still your master. How does that make you feel?"  Their hubris will cost them in the end when real conflict erupts

1328490029325410307 2020-11-17 08:07:59 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Ask yourself if you truly add to the atmosphere of a room when you're in it. You don't have to be the center of attention, but would the vibe be different if you weren't there? If the answer is no, you can change it. Start doing things. Become more interesting. Don't be a NPC.
1328489107048247301 2020-11-17 08:04:19 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> If you don't read or learn regularly, have no hobbies, etc you become really boring. No new ideas to contribute to yourself or others, nothing of substance to add to a conversation, no real presence of your own. Awful fate, I highly recommend avoiding it.
1328478049730441219 2020-11-17 07:20:23 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I say this to illustrate how dire our cultural situation is. People pretend that we're still on the edge, and that we just need a few corrections to fix this culture. We've been far over the edge for a long time now. This isn't the time for baby steps or moderate solutions.
1328477021131972608 2020-11-17 07:16:18 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> People fail to realize (or choose to overlook) that the West hasn't been Christian, or spiritual at all for that matter, for 100s of years. The days of Kant and Hume being the primary philosophical voices of Europe were way back in the 1700s. We've been atheistic for a while.

1327403824890437632 2020-11-14 08:11:48 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Just learned there's a rather large group of people into "shifting," where they allegedly use visualization to transport themselves to a fictional world such as Harry Potter and lead double lives there.

1327018096016695296 2020-11-13 06:39:03 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @westernbrahmin Same. I do it because I'm afraid that they'll die due to lack of food but I may just let them stay and feed on pests like roaches, mosquitoes, flys etc
1327015400815595521 2020-11-13 06:28:20 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Interesting, never knew this. Always been my favorite beer even before I learned to hate h*ps. Crazy how I orient myself towards greatness even unconsciously

1326645651577450498 2020-11-12 05:59:05 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Only a society that has descended to historically unprecedented depths of weakness would create, much less accept, something like this.
1326598684553916416 2020-11-12 02:52:28 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @AlthusserHIVcum Fair enough!
1326597197228630017 2020-11-12 02:46:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @AlthusserHIVcum regardless of what conclusions he came to after advancing past his own "camel" stage. Plus, not very Nietzschian to dogmatize his philosophy to the point where we aren't allowed to criticize and reinterpret it to try and find something better.
1326596673703976969 2020-11-12 02:44:28 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @AlthusserHIVcum Nietzsche grew up in a highly religious environment, and himself was very devout for a while. If you read his camel-&gt;lion-&gt;child allegory he clearly considers the discipline and sense of responsibility instilled him by religion to be indispensable to his discovery of the Overman,

1326377126585659393 2020-11-11 12:12:04 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @armstrrng I do like Ortho church the best due to its plurality of beliefs one can have as long as they acknowledge the Sacraments. But...there is a lot of stagnacy in it unfortunately. I believe the Eastern church was also opposed to Charlemagne when he first took power
1326376485310099457 2020-11-11 12:09:31 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @armstrrng Yeah...I strongly dislike Rose for that reason. Read his Religion of the Future book and could barely finish it because of how ignorant most of it was. I actually attend an Ortho church but I run into conflict with a lot of the dogmas of some of the Fathers
1326375351442927617 2020-11-11 12:05:01 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Remember when that Centipede dubstep song was the theme song for the Trump meme brigade?
1326374033210929157 2020-11-11 11:59:47 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @armstrrng should definitely incorporate it. Renaissance culture was a great example of the two working hand in hand.
1326373834124107777 2020-11-11 11:58:59 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @armstrrng Either way I've heard that argument also used for Constantine, which is fair. But either way they managed to practice the Christian faith while also keeping the Hellenstic vitalism alive, which I think is crucial. Paganism suffers from the problems I mentioned much less so we

1326368825491775489 2020-11-11 11:39:05 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral Much appreciated friend!
1326323010614267904 2020-11-11 08:37:02 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @PhocaeanD True, always said that the John Lennon secularized hippie religion is basically just copying Christianity without any of the discipline, judgement, objective morality etc. Nihilism disguised as tolerance and compassion
1326321767900729345 2020-11-11 08:32:05 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> The Odyssey's sirens were trying to warn us of this, as well as many of modern society's amenities
1326306647514488833 2020-11-11 07:32:01 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Lmao
1326297406342881284 2020-11-11 06:55:17 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Totally possible that the coming of the Overman and the Second Coming are the same phenomenon interpreted in radically different ways.
1326297079212355593 2020-11-11 06:53:59 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> But that does not mean Christianity is fundamentally like this at its core, and that's where Nietzsche was off the mark. Jesus encouraged action in his followers. Charlemagne, Charles Martel, etc were men of power and action. The problems come from bad interpretation.
1326296594766049282 2020-11-11 06:52:04 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> There is a dangerous tendency within folllwers of Abrahamic religion to turn to escapism and put all their stock in an abstract realm separate from the here and now. That is a totally fair criticism. St Augustine himself was a Manichean before joining the Church.
1326296146793345024 2020-11-11 06:50:17 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> When you bring up issues that we need to fight against they will just say that the world is supposed to get worse before Jesus returns, but Christians have been saying that since the beginning. Many in ancient Rome thought Revelation would happen in their lifetime.
1326295616755011584 2020-11-11 06:48:11 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I see many Christians who neglect proper exercise/diet because "the flesh is temporary but the soul is eternal." I see them passively accept subjugation by a draconian government/media establishment because "we don't live for this world, we live for the next one."
1326294909607944192 2020-11-11 06:45:22 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Nietzsche's criticisms of Christianity become much more agreeable when you apply it to Christianity as most of the average population defines it, not to Christian theology as a whole.

1325305122692403201 2020-11-08 13:12:18 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Physique is very important, but it's better to train for functionality and athleticism, and take the physique that comes along with that as a bonus. Know a lot of ripped dudes who still eat garbage food and are unathletic

1325123910329794561 2020-11-08 01:12:14 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> This is an age of dissolution and chaos whether you like it or not, thus a certain level of spiritual fluidity is needed. Those too rigid in past dogma, be it Christian, pagan or anything else, won't make it to the other side.

1324103045307944961 2020-11-05 05:35:41 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Rooting for Trump but Biden is honestly the figurehead this country deserves rn. More representative of what it's become and this whole election proves it.
1324058820755279873 2020-11-05 02:39:57 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> For the record, I never wanted a "vote"  in the first place. I want my rightful seat as conquering Emperor and have since birth. This was a just a means to an end. Let the collapse come! The conqueror will rise again.
1324056493264637959 2020-11-05 02:30:42 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Honestly whatever. If Dems cheat their way to the WH it just exposes democracy for the sham it has long since become, and the inevitable fight will come sooner. Trump was here to buy 4 more yrs of stagnant normalcy but he was never fixing this. No one can.
1323891399268442113 2020-11-04 15:34:40 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Johnnyskooks @restitutordivi It's like they only have one insult

1323832008569704450 2020-11-04 11:38:41 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @BasedPhilostrat Yeah it's a little weird to see everyone getting this hype about the el*ction when most acknowledge that democracy is trash overall. I view Trump winning as a nice way to buy more time, but ot isn't going to fix any of our problems
1323831563633729539 2020-11-04 11:36:55 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @comoesestojusto I think it's part of All Saints Day in Spain but it's more of its own tradition outside of Catholicism in Mexico. Even though most Mexican citizens are Catholic regardless lol
1323487855059107841 2020-11-03 12:51:08 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Mexico's Day of the Dead is a great tradition. We really should have something similar in America/Europe.

Man's duty is to be able to do what must be done without the need for constant emotional gratification, and life trains him for this. The woman is meant to be emotionally sated more in her role, nothing wrong w/that
1323062369048793089 2020-11-02 08:40:24 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @0x49fa98 experiences can often be  separated  periods of uncertainty and, as you said, a feeling of indifference. I often feel the moments of powerful guidance and affirmation come after I have "earned" them, as it were, through acts of striving and effort amidst apathy.
1323061551834763265 2020-11-02 08:37:09 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @0x49fa98 Not quite sure I'd go this far as to ascribe an all-encompassing indifference to the universe. As a man I would say I definitely feel plenty of times where I recieve a sort of affirmation that things are guided by a plan, and that powerful forces are in my corner. But such

1321920286611148802 2020-10-30 05:02:11 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @restitutordivi It's a tough game. On one hand maybe one of us should just stand up, but unless others choose to wake up with us, we will just be devoured by the mob and media will use it as a green light to arrest anyone who shares our ideals.

The question is why are you still letting them do this? How many more immigrants need to behead your people? How many more churches need to burn?

1321917456949104642 2020-10-30 04:50:56 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @hyper_high @SolBrah Yep. But maybe you're a libertarian who thinks things shouldn't be regulated. Do you think porn should be legal?
1321893780426051584 2020-10-30 03:16:51 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Highly recommend adding bent press to your routine. Very underrated lift  https://t.co/o3X13QTiuH
1321889790975946753 2020-10-30 03:01:00 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @hyper_high @SolBrah Kinda different when corporations are bombing you with marketing for these things since birth. I managed to free myself from it but it's definitely putting people at a disadvantage
1321884215789670401 2020-10-30 02:38:51 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Really tried to get into Malazan but the author's cucked political and religious views were too much. Shame because it really is one of the more interesting fantasy worlds I've seen
1321695098850185216 2020-10-29 14:07:22 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Drank two glasses of kefir tonight and feel extreme powerful, will repeat tomorrow
1321693586421911553 2020-10-29 14:01:21 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> It's cringe like this that has pushed me to rock the shaven look more often.
1321643902047309827 2020-10-29 10:43:55 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Pop-science nihilists will say that because planets and stars are so large, that makes us insignificant. What's funny is that such logic doesn't even make sense scientifically because particles are just as materially significant as the things they make up.
1321642788748972033 2020-10-29 10:39:30 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Doonvorcannon One of my highest aspirations. Will not rest till they swim freely
1321642591016914944 2020-10-29 10:38:43 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Doonvorcannon One of the few animals that I can truly say may be smarter than us
1321642490580115463 2020-10-29 10:38:19 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Doonvorcannon Favorite animal (all dolphins are). Different pods have different cultures where they will literally eat only one food for no logical reason. And yes, zero human attaqs in wild. Only by the ones in captivity who are severely brain damaged from abuse and even then usually accident
1321641465991364608 2020-10-29 10:34:15 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Nice 16 hour fast today after carrot salad detox last night. Feels good to hit the reset button at times
1321603841570340866 2020-10-29 08:04:44 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Most cases of anxiety come from lack of mental stimulation. If you don't tire your brain out it's going to use that unspent energy in ways you probably won't like.
1321595035457126404 2020-10-29 07:29:45 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Nietzsche had no respect for the modern nihilist who avoids any sense of duty. In fact he pretty much says the only way to the Superman is to let yourself be conditioned into virtue by religious duty while avoiding the pitfalls of dogmatism.
1321594523596836865 2020-10-29 07:27:43 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Modern Nietzschians love to bash religious dedication, but if you read Zarathustra's allegory of the camel-&gt;lion-&gt; child transformation you'd realize his only problem with dogma is when one doesn't use it as a means for higher growth. He hated stagnant order, not order itself.
1321592355682734080 2020-10-29 07:19:06 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @GRITCULT Meh, you're oversimplifying this just as much as the people you're complaining about. Just about every group of people has recognized the existence of universal forms. This goes back to even before Plato. Midwits misuse the concept but you can say that about anything
1321588919553695746 2020-10-29 07:05:27 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @gvlovelady I wanna say "At least he's promoting Christianity" but...I just can't do it
1321588225585065984 2020-10-29 07:02:41 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> "Fake it till you make it" is a high risk-high reward strategy. If you can eventually live up to your act, you essentially spoke your superego into reality. If not, you're just a poser. Use it very carefully!
1321584907353755649 2020-10-29 06:49:30 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> This is not the Kanye Christian revival we want.
1321584025400758275 2020-10-29 06:46:00 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Live look at me waiting for an answer to my perfectly reasonable question on StackOverflow  https://t.co/p1C75VvgQE
1321572624607137794 2020-10-29 06:00:41 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @ivystyleprimacy Completely true bro, in many other time periods it was normal to be good at many things. Renaissance, ancient Greece, and others considered polymathy the norm. This idea of hyperspecialization in one thing is very recent. Likely pushed by....them....to make good obedient workers
1321570693419511808 2020-10-29 05:53:01 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @ritter_goetz @_forest_seeker_ Vermont has the right idea with banning billboards. They're an abomination
1321564124938227712 2020-10-29 05:26:55 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @LandsharkRides If I ever become famous and am subsequently cancelled in the US(very likely) I will probably just bring a good sum of US dollars to some 3rd world country, buy a militia and try to become a dictatorial warlord in the vein of Saddam or Gaddafi. Would be extremely thrilling
1321562020211269633 2020-10-29 05:18:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> As arrogant as I may be, I refuse to believe I'm some natural born superhuman for being able to do this. I'm just a normal guy who decided he wanted more for himself. And I still have much more work to do.
1321561656590258176 2020-10-29 05:17:07 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> It's not really that hard to workout 3-4x a week, while also reading and meditating a bit each day. I do all of these things even when working full time and playing video games most days. You just have to know your "why" and commit to improvement.
1321559912221151233 2020-10-29 05:10:11 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> If you can hang with me in fitness, but can't touch me intellectually, you aren't my rival. If you can do both but eat like crap, not my rival. If you can do all 3 but are anxious and unconfident all the time...you know the rest. We aren't made to choose one area to be great in.
1321551721336885249 2020-10-29 04:37:38 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @MunkusMonkey I would recommend something like dessicated liver pills or organ complex for vit D supplementation. Standard supplements don't absorb well and have other toxic chemicals added in
1321289574128209921 2020-10-28 11:15:57 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @sellyourcloaka1 It can be impactful for those who use properly and sparingly, but completely pointless and cringe to try articulating the experience for others. Some things don't need to and shouldn't be shared
1321288832285892614 2020-10-28 11:13:00 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @MonkeyLifter Blue lives matter
1321288707027148805 2020-10-28 11:12:30 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Have you ever considered that maybe, instead of some past trauma or life in general, the reason you feel depressed/unsure of yourself is because you're deficient in multiple key nutrients and don't exercise?
1321226979358724098 2020-10-28 07:07:13 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> When you truly make the decision to break away from the toxic aspects of mainstream culture it's almost dissociating to interact with people who live "normal" lives. Basically like interacting with a different culture altogether.
1321225475088355330 2020-10-28 07:01:15 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @YoungEmissary Only way it works it when you essentially design it to run on the older system but have the newer version just look a bit shinier. Like Breath of the Wild did
1321225032828391430 2020-10-28 06:59:29 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @DamuOrb @bronzeagemantis Nope, never attended CF gym and never will. There's some good foundational stuff there but mostly garbage
1321214905798844416 2020-10-28 06:19:15 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Doonvorcannon Not to discount books, painting, etc. Just that vidya or manga doesn't have to compete with the Virgils, Michaelangelos, etc of history. Very young mediums
1321214548762894338 2020-10-28 06:17:50 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Doonvorcannon I think that manga/anime/video games have a great chance to be what leads to high art in our own era. They are all mediums that are total products of this epoch and culture. Very popular but still underrated in how powerful they can be artistically
1321204404461150209 2020-10-28 05:37:31 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @sellyourcloaka1 100%. I don't even like to abuse fast travel in games
1321202322266095616 2020-10-28 05:29:15 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @KolonialBarbar Cheap materialist cop out for having good character and deeds
1321187459791728641 2020-10-28 04:30:11 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @gvlovelady But again, maybe it's still best for me to vote because at least Trump can buy us a bit more time to prepare for what comes next. But I can't see anyone ever running later that I'll care enough to vote for. I share much of Plato's views on democracy, I think it's run its course
1321186849885474816 2020-10-28 04:27:46 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @gvlovelady going to be solved through it. Some kind of conflict is inevitable. Even if I'm not going to vote Biden it's still humiliating to have him as one of two candidates to be our "leader" and I don't feel like it's my moral duty to participate in that
1321186462105325568 2020-10-28 04:26:13 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @gvlovelady I do like Trump and think he's the better candidate, so I do have some motivation to support him in that maybe he can at least buy us 4 more years of shaky normalcy, but I think our whole election system is an embarrassment at this point and none of our problems are ultimately
1321168340174385161 2020-10-28 03:14:13 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I feel absolutely zero moral obligation to vote if we're being honest. If I do it'll literally be just to appease loved ones and even then, it'll be the last time.
1320980712644841477 2020-10-27 14:48:39 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @bronzeagemantis Blessed that the sport I do now allows me to be almost naked.
1320952410521698305 2020-10-27 12:56:11 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> They're ceremonial, and they look cool. That's reason enough when you aren't a utilitarian cuck.
1320877687385198598 2020-10-27 07:59:16 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @ritter_goetz I'm gonna say positive due to how toxic office culture is. Ability to gain money while still keeping things in order at home has been great for me personally. But depends on the person or industry I suppose
1320868386616782848 2020-10-27 07:22:18 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Even the fitness companies. This is not acceptable.  https://t.co/JKtClNbVIo
1319714633771585536 2020-10-24 02:57:42 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> "As an atheist, I'm quite the smart guy. Due to how smart I am, I disagree with you. Blocking you now out of sheer intelligence."  https://t.co/sOmDBvIi76
1319713400516206592 2020-10-24 02:52:48 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @SleepinEyes @FlightAstral 3Logical5Me
1319712403198717955 2020-10-24 02:48:50 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @SleepinEyes @FlightAstral Found the atheist
1319710217223999488 2020-10-24 02:40:09 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Don't just play *that* mission in MW2 guys. Make it a reality.  https://t.co/WWhXuDbVPe
1319705922579693568 2020-10-24 02:23:05 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @ritter_goetz some fresh air lol
1319705880846360577 2020-10-24 02:22:55 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @ritter_goetz Agreed. I think this definitely has a "real" quality to it given that at least most of us are real people with the same issues of dissociation. I've found a nice camaraderie here which helps me not get too autistic in the normie sphere. Just gotta know when to log off and get
1319704891808485379 2020-10-24 02:18:59 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @ritter_goetz Like the philosophical/political/schizophrenic convos I can have here simply don't make sense to pretty much anyone I talk to IRL lmao
1319704679950000129 2020-10-24 02:18:09 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @ritter_goetz It's a complicated game. Personally I feel like IRL connections obviously have higher innate quality to them but, like most of us, I find myself surrounded with people I can't really relate to on a deeper level. So this provides an outlet for that, no matter how incomplete.
1319470385834983425 2020-10-23 10:47:09 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Watching reactions to the debates really betrays how much of an act most of the far right's personality is tbh. Just as pacified by MSM as anyone else
1319466427951292419 2020-10-23 10:31:25 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @CentroLeaks What are Galarian Slowking's stats
1319462121239883777 2020-10-23 10:14:18 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I honestly think one of the most mortal sins no one talks about is being boring.
1319446259648876545 2020-10-23 09:11:17 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Absolutely pointless to devote an entire evening to these debates. Again, you guys are just turning into Boomers.
1319414049797476352 2020-10-23 07:03:17 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Another friendly reminder that the ancient Egyptians were white.
1319343890579816448 2020-10-23 02:24:30 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @SolBrah "B-b-but VANITY!!"
1319343653756805123 2020-10-23 02:23:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Anyone who denies the very obvious benefits of steady-state running is just bad at it, or doesn't have the discipline to stick to it
1319066396412813315 2020-10-22 08:01:50 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Schopenhauer, whom I honestly find very overrated, was misguided when he said that the pleasure a predator gains from a kill is outweighed by the suffering of its prey. Maybe he identified more with a prey animal, would explain all his angst and defeatism.
1319065692239519744 2020-10-22 07:59:02 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @CentroLeaks You realize what you've done?
1319058399829647366 2020-10-22 07:30:04 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> You honestly love to see this. Always satisfying to see them try to force something on us with incessant marketing/celebrity endorsements and have it still fail.
1319031716670066688 2020-10-22 05:44:02 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @PhocaeanD Ok but what if I run with my head down and arms behind my back
1319027326097604608 2020-10-22 05:26:35 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @_soggycrouton Right
1319026924103094280 2020-10-22 05:24:59 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @_soggycrouton That this is your attempt to rationalize having a heretical pope
1319025022221144064 2020-10-22 05:17:26 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Cope
1319019455926669313 2020-10-22 04:55:19 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @hyperboriankiwi Yeah but they paved the way for Imagine Dragons
1318986602060914689 2020-10-22 02:44:46 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FritzInTheWoods I do go outside and get a quick meditation to start the day and get some sun, and mosquitoes are usually bad because of the dew. I try my best to just let them be so I'm not so taken away by slight discomfort. Have gotten much better at it
1318986282425516032 2020-10-22 02:43:29 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FritzInTheWoods Nahh I'm just shotposting this time. But it may be a good idea...
1318981941899808768 2020-10-22 02:26:15 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I know dudes who use nicotine literally right before bed and then pretend they don't know why they need naps to function after work everyday. Might as well have a pre-bed coffee while you're at it lmao
1318751462621663234 2020-10-21 11:10:24 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> In a sense, what determines whether or not a toxic substance is made illegal is how quickly it kills you. For example, meth is illegal because it can destroy your body in a matter of months. Seed oils, on the other hand, are legal because they take a few decades to do it.
1318749144597647360 2020-10-21 11:01:11 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Tried bugbathing tonight. Slathered myself in local honey and laid outside after a rainstorm. The mosquitoes were relentless but it was a great test of discipline and my immune system
1318746989459365891 2020-10-21 10:52:38 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @LegacyFuel Weed only makes you that way if you were that way to begin with tbh. Addy and moda are crutches you shouldn't need
1318745936500264960 2020-10-21 10:48:27 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> In hindsight, what was ever the point of underwear? Honest question
1318745485772001280 2020-10-21 10:46:39 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @restitutordivi I think we can grow it back
1318744419303100416 2020-10-21 10:42:25 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I'm significantly more athletic than nearly all of you.

1318379469527199745 2020-10-20 10:32:14 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @AmericanThad Gotta love the cliche pop beat with trumpets to let you know how victorious the video is supposed to feel
1318377627070193670 2020-10-20 10:24:55 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Thinking about Gaddafi and his fate tonight. Am I willing to undergo what he did if my ambitions fail? If I am not...I must change that
1318377128853987328 2020-10-20 10:22:56 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> This civilization is obnoxiously loud about how dead it is

1318011092396900354 2020-10-19 10:08:26 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> If you're getting adequate sleep throughout the week you won't have to sleep all day on the weekends and waste your free days
1318009974753234945 2020-10-19 10:04:00 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @PhocaeanD But the book is right in that blindly throwing "hard work" at everything can do more harm than good. Many take this approach unfortunately
1318009733085843457 2020-10-19 10:03:02 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @PhocaeanD I agree, but I also think the book, as basic and cringe as it is, does have a point about the Protestant work ethic being a trap. You should certainly find a way to work smarter and get the most returns per effort, then give it your all.

1317620487317540870 2020-10-18 08:16:19 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I really wish I knew how easy HTML was long ago
1317610385969729537 2020-10-18 07:36:10 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Can confidently say after finishing the post-game that Odyssey is the best 3D Mario
1317561677114757126 2020-10-18 04:22:37 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral I figure that it's a reactionary thing against the current narrative as a whole, which includes cigs being unhealthy
1317560166259298308 2020-10-18 04:16:37 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @_forest_seeker_ Perhaps so, if you could not do it daily in the amounts most do it and live healthy in other areas, plus I'd venture to say using more pure or natural stuff would be much better than, say, a can of Grizzly which may have more additives
1317559432688132097 2020-10-18 04:13:42 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral Tbh I would bet money that's at least a big factor. We've been doing that on an archetypal level especially from the modern era onward. Science has been on some crusade to desanctify every past era ever since it became secular. Maybe that's why things like the nuke happened
1317558423966404608 2020-10-18 04:09:41 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral Lol that does sound nuts too though, gonna need to look into it. I actually haven't seen the show but probably should, I just loved the classic arcade game as a child. Was ridiculously hard tho

1317153065028517889 2020-10-17 01:18:56 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Say what you will but No Doubt had some absolute bangers in the early 2000s.
1317125387978231809 2020-10-16 23:28:58 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> You have had multiple generations to watch and see how tobacco and nicotine can destroy the body. If you still do it knowing these things, at least be real enough to admit you don't care about your health

1316235776569507841 2020-10-14 12:33:58 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @trooperdeleon @Doonvorcannon The setting itself is sci-fi but the protagonist only understands it in medieval terms. So a lot of things he describes as "tower" or "spear" are often spaceships or some futuristic weapon but you have to read between the lines at the subtle hints he gives
1316222938543271937 2020-10-14 11:42:57 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @trooperdeleon @Doonvorcannon It's one of those really unique series where you either love it or don't. Might be my favorite but I also can see why others wouldn't like it. It's not like LotR where you almost expect everyone to like it to some extent
1316219580981948416 2020-10-14 11:29:36 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Doonvorcannon is telling the story. I will eventually check Knight as well but from most fans it seems the consensus is that Wizard Knight is Wolfe's take on the generic high fantasy/boy hero adventure whereas New Sun is...kinda its own thing lol
1316219238395379713 2020-10-14 11:28:15 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Doonvorcannon I haven't read any of The Wizard Knight series but from what I've heard it's got a lot less depth than BotNS. The protagonist/narrator, being a teenager, seems to be a much more simple person than BotNS so the prose is much simpler. Gene tends to mold his writing style around who

1313934781240037379 2020-10-08 04:10:38 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Like it or not we live in a technological age. You need to be able to work with it to get anything done. Even if you hate this society and want to change it from the ground up, you will need tech to do it. Adapt or be left behind in the dustbin of history.
1313931706609659912 2020-10-08 03:58:25 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> There really is no good excuse for anyone under 60 to not be somewhat technologically adept, unless you're willing to go live with the Amish. I know the "return to monke" crowd won't like this but sorry, life is about adapting.

1313538436884762625 2020-10-07 01:55:42 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @RBayes14 True. I've always heard it said that you should try not to give them "Bulletin board material". Some opponents feed off trash talk and you're helping them by doing it. For me personally I do like to add some flair and swagger when appropriate. Usually I try to stay quiet and
1313535479866896385 2020-10-07 01:43:57 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @OUTLAW_PRIME Lot to unpack here  https://t.co/dl81AOHuPA
1313303055757172736 2020-10-06 10:20:23 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> My "politics" literally boil down to this one statement: I want to conquer the world and rule it as king. I'm not memeing, I'm not exaggerating, that's it. Any stance that I take on today's issues stems from that.
1312103009736818688 2020-10-03 02:51:49 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @RBayes14 I'm more speaking on the common idea that giving yourself compliments or expecting greatness from yourself is "arrogant." You have to speak it into existence if you want to achieve it. No one will believe in you if you don't. Need a balance between humility and cockiness
1312102440024506368 2020-10-03 02:49:34 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @RBayes14 Or if someone says "Do you think you're gonna do good." I'm not gonna say "W-well gee I hope I do," like most would. If I put the work in I expect to do well, and I will be fully upfront about it
1312102130111504384 2020-10-03 02:48:20 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @RBayes14 For sure. I rarely say anything when I, for example, show up to a competition. Usually very quiet and let my performance do the talking. But if someone asks me if I'm good I'm not gonna be like "Ehhh I'm OK I guess." Because that's just self-deprecating to me
1312095860755509251 2020-10-03 02:23:25 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> False humility is the most common weakness masked as a virtue in this society. If I'm a badass at something, I'm not gonna pretend I'm not. I worked for it, so I'm going to fully enjoy the fruits of my labors. You reap what you sow, no?
1312092298281463813 2020-10-03 02:09:16 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @YoungEmissary Is this proof RW bodybuilders need leftist art hoes?
1312059528054177793 2020-10-02 23:59:03 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral Agreed. Definitely a ceiling somewhere out in the aether. The big question is if we as a species are even capable of hitting it in our lifetime, or if we will go extinct first. Perhaps God prevents us from ever getting that far, so thar we always have something to strive for.
1312056103019122689 2020-10-02 23:45:26 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral humans. I do agree that the speed of technology has an unnatural effect on us that can be detrimental, but I think it may also be because we have achieved a level of tech we weren't spiritually prepared for (thanks Enlightenment)
1312055716333662211 2020-10-02 23:43:54 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral But I suppose I'd have to read that to understand his argument more in depth. I'm just giving an initial impression of it based on my own thoughts but idk what all he's using to form that point. I did see his thoughts on fear and how the instant speed of computers causes it in
1312053438776213509 2020-10-02 23:34:51 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral the right pace. Hard to know this for sure but I think that with every advancing age, the bar for what limits we could or should achieve gets a bit higher.
1312052567162187780 2020-10-02 23:31:23 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral I suppose I mean both, but I would also agree with that point in the context of a single time period. There is always a law of diminishing returns with speed, go too fast all at once and you crash. But I'm also not sure if there's a set upper limit to speed if we accelerate at

So wouldnt surprise me if Nietzsche didn't get a similar mythological treatment. Oh well, myth is realer than material anyway
1311728013420134401 2020-10-02 02:01:43 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FlightAstral Nietzsche was the sacrificial figure that kicked off postmodernity just as Socrates was for Greek Philosophical Revolution, Christ for Christian era, Galileo for Enl*ghtenment era, etc

1311431820467204096 2020-10-01 06:24:45 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @LegacyFuel Main benefit of it is improving your cold resistance mechanisms, so sure people in hot climates should definitely do it, but dudes in Minnesota are already getting that lmao
1311427193063571457 2020-10-01 06:06:22 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Lmao, clown world.  https://t.co/n4Hbt3mWHz
1311407780679610369 2020-10-01 04:49:14 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Every single movement, no matter how awful, has arisen in the collective conscious has a valid reason behind it. A lesson we must learn going forward. This even includes things such as the Enlightenment or Sexual Revolution.
1311406327902736390 2020-10-01 04:43:27 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @DeVoCompagnie She may be a freak but she got bangers 🤷‍♂️
1311406019105480711 2020-10-01 04:42:14 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @428a2f98 Ah, that makes sense. Wonder if dude really agrees with the pasta or is just trying to satirize it. Either way not gonna help him get matches lmao
1311405349153509382 2020-10-01 04:39:34 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @DrutangAtHome Still remember getting Last Turn on the first pack where it was the cover card. Been my signature card since then, idc if it's banned
1311404975617081345 2020-10-01 04:38:05 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Gonna be real here. While I totally agree with Jake's point, dude is the biggest clown in this exchange. You're bashing Tinder...on your Tinder account. Delete your account or just admit you're thirsty enough to feed into the system you claim to hate.
1311404102547632128 2020-10-01 04:34:37 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> First and probably only competition of the year coming up next weekend. Haven't raced since before I completely revamped diet, exercise, etc. Excited to see the improvement!
1311065686857449475 2020-09-30 06:09:52 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Imagine wanting to be lead around like a puppy dog your whole life just to fulfill "gf's" whims for entertainment.

1310990902165467136 2020-09-30 01:12:42 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Also have had great interactions with my anima. Very wholesome encounters. My power is growing!
1310990745424334849 2020-09-30 01:12:05 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Common theme in my dreams has become running from/fighting the FBI. Had a savage fight with them last night. Went full animal mode and shredded them with my claws. What mean?
1310734679453163520 2020-09-29 08:14:34 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Once you are past age 23-25, who you are is mostly a result of your lifestyle and decisions. The torch has been passed from your genetics/upbringing and you can now blame only yourself.

1310647125596925967 2020-09-29 02:26:40 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Or, like many in this corner, you're addicted to stimulants and need to stop overloading your body.
1310646779566845954 2020-09-29 02:25:17 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> It's just as easy to overdo sleep as it is to not get enough. If you're getting 7-9 hrs a night and still needing lengthy naps, feeling tired throughout the day, etc, you probably have some hormonal issues you need to look into.
1310631437511675905 2020-09-29 01:24:19 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> -Philosophy is a valuable field, you're just too mentally lazy to understand it.
1310631043138048001 2020-09-29 01:22:45 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> -Steroid use is a shortcut, and shortcuts almost always have consequences. Your ancestors were more athletic than any modern steroid user.  -Steady state cardio is just as important as weightlifting  -Reading books and exercising your brain is as important as weightlifting.
1310630229040398340 2020-09-29 01:19:31 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> -There is no cool way to use Tinder or Bumble. -You cannot "retvrn" to an era you never lived in, and trying to do so is cope for lack of creativity. -The reason you want a "gf" so bad is the same reason you can't get one.
1310629677271322626 2020-09-29 01:17:20 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Hard truths for the far right to accept: -Science/space are great when used properly, and space travel is the future. -It would actually be better to smoke weed everyday than to use nicotine/tabacco even once a week (not that I recommend either one.)
1310624781872566275 2020-09-29 00:57:52 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @BronzeAgeBot This is false btw. Chimps in both captivity and nature rarely ever do. It's likely because they don't have the capacity or desire to create erotic fantasies in their heads. Only humans do
1310623653613142016 2020-09-29 00:53:23 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @itouchanabomb Yes
1310622122411266048 2020-09-29 00:47:18 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Yes. And we still want it.
1310364900343119878 2020-09-28 07:45:12 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Just from a mechanistic standpoint, taking something that is a stimulant (increases heart rate ) while also being a vasoconstrictor (narrows the blood vessels to impede blood flow) seems like a pretty dangerous game to me.
1309985347900760067 2020-09-27 06:36:59 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @collnsmith But they did, and their lead singer was a wife beating atheist scumbag

1309904714767757317 2020-09-27 01:16:35 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Cope. I've been broke and still turned out insanely impressive

1309650870045495296 2020-09-26 08:27:54 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @ZoomerBronzeage One of the few things that makes me physically sick and filled with bloodlust anytime I think of it. They will all burn
1309648200064806912 2020-09-26 08:17:17 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @ZoomerBronzeage Yeah, for me it's an ethical thing more than anything else. I just refuse to contribute to factory farms. But it's clearly also a huge health benefit as well lol
1309647322465406976 2020-09-26 08:13:48 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Reject the Divine Feminine all you want but we will only achieve the next level of cultural vitality through integrating both sides of the spectrum, male and female. The cosmic marriage has already begun, now we have to refine it. We will never "retvrn" to any dead epoch.
1309644057929486336 2020-09-26 08:00:50 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @ZoomerBronzeage I won't buy anything non pasture raised and organic personally

1309599171381526530 2020-09-26 05:02:28 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> "Bro you can still pay for Netflix just ignore the bad stuff."  But you're still willingly giving money to pedophiles and zoophiles. Why does your desire for entertainment outweigh your principles?
1309594977559814146 2020-09-26 04:45:48 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Imagine still paying for Netflix
1309566419848355842 2020-09-26 02:52:19 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Thank you for this Kanye and I agree that bowl
1309537108231680004 2020-09-26 00:55:51 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @GreenShootsS @techceopepe But this is another debate entirely, OP was saying athletic performance declines after 25 in the context of sports and I just said that's false
1309536599223476225 2020-09-26 00:53:49 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @GreenShootsS @techceopepe It's not far off. But I don't really live a typical lifestyle. I'm fully in agreement that the modern 4HL lifestyle is awful, but I'm also not a primitivist who thinks that everything post-hunter gatherer is unnatural. Not sure that's the only way a back is "supposed to look"
1309515030765936641 2020-09-25 23:28:07 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @GreenShootsS @techceopepe There are also pro-athletes that perform just as good if not better well into their 30s, some even beyond that.
1309514451117395970 2020-09-25 23:25:49 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @GreenShootsS @techceopepe Sounds like cope to me. I've already proven this wrong in my own life. Blame yourself bruh
1309509547267104769 2020-09-25 23:06:20 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @techceopepe False if you take care of your body

1309495940324225024 2020-09-25 22:12:16 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Not sure why we still let moneytwitter and these shallow "hustle" bros in this community at all. It's all underpinned by soulless postmodern materialism

1309196104798535686 2020-09-25 02:20:49 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Funny how anytime I comment on a normie post about body positivity or BLM, the people who argue with me are overwhelmingly women with CashApp links in their bio. Any ideas as to why?

1309154090547642369 2020-09-24 23:33:52 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @ritter_goetz Forgot this guy blocked me LMAO I can't even remember why
1309134361950908418 2020-09-24 22:15:29 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> This is an impressive level of cope.
1308939534646870017 2020-09-24 09:21:18 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @orapronobisdeum I agree. It's more the intention to me. Feels like he's doing this as a character of "The Catholic priest on Ninja Warrior." Might feel differently if he seemed to be sincerely blessing the ground, calling God to bless him in the competition. But his body language says otherwise
1308935460543180809 2020-09-24 09:05:07 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FritzInTheWoods @PierreDeChimpo Not saying it will come to that, I doubt it will, I guess I'm just speaking in a more hypothetical sense
1308935334210789376 2020-09-24 09:04:37 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FritzInTheWoods @PierreDeChimpo way to start a family without forfeiting my own ambitions or goals, I would gladly forgego it and wouldn't consider my life a failure

1308934795947388929 2020-09-24 09:02:28 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @FritzInTheWoods @PierreDeChimpo I get what you're saying. I definitely plan to have kids in the future. My point is that pretty much everyone I know has settled into a life where they have time for work, family and not much else. But they'll rationalize a that away with "Well family is what's important."
1308933803432386565 2020-09-24 08:58:32 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @MixOMadness @Work_Schmurk @TreySongz Yes it does. And blacks are not oppressed in this country. In fact they're privileged, as are women.
1308933366524391430 2020-09-24 08:56:48 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Sports news? What sport did Breonna Taylor play?? I didn't know she was an athlete.  https://t.co/OdYjnHBe3K
1308920210209075203 2020-09-24 08:04:31 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I really don't feel comfortable bringing a kid into a world I did nothing to try and fix. No disrespect to those with kids, raising a family is beautiful. But I simply cannot forfeit my path for the sake of stability or "normalcy".

1308845681835212807 2020-09-24 03:08:22 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Still blows my mind how normal it is for women, no matter what their profession is, to put their CashApp in their bio just in case someone wants to send them money for no reason. The Willendorf goddess has returned.

Effective but I'd like some formal technique in that area
1308825149731299328 2020-09-24 01:46:47 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @ritter_goetz Yeah I did Taekwondo as a kid, got black belt. I don't necessarily use everything I learned now but it did instill a lot of good foundations at an early age which I'm thankful for. Thinking about possibly picking up kung fu, muy thai or judo

1308480014472577025 2020-09-23 02:55:20 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> If you work a normal M-F job you really can't afford to be leaving the house and messing around every weekend. That's valuable time to be planning and working towards your goals. Not saying you can't chill and have fun but being unable to stay home for a weekend is a time sink.

I'd say the supps probably absorb fine since it is real dessicated meat, but obviously just eating it straight up is likely still the best. I still eat a small bit of raw liver before workouts some days

The experiences of life don't fade if you preserve your youth in body, mind and spirit. Those who claim they don't feel things like they did as children have let themselves grow old.
1305703126163390465 2020-09-15 11:00:58 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Deload week is extremely rewarding. Get to experience the endorphin buzz of training without the stress of fatigue
1305654356319010817 2020-09-15 07:47:11 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @margaritaevna95 Ok, and in return I demand your unquestioned obedience
1305653516824965120 2020-09-15 07:43:50 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Wait until they find out that the old Aryan caste system still exists in Bollywood.
1305653083620478976 2020-09-15 07:42:07 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I've noticed that the neo-Cathar philosophy of hating the body/material world almost never comes from people with healthy or attractive bodies.
1305552393564819456 2020-09-15 01:02:01 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> People who practically live their lives on auto-pilot are the most annoying to interact with.
1304980229925072897 2020-09-13 11:08:26 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @YoungEmissary Visions of a better age
1304946100474871808 2020-09-13 08:52:49 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @YoungEmissary If you are a guy who only plays things like shooters or character action and doesn't like turn based combat I get that, but if not I would say it's a must-play, nothing else like it out there
1304945708534059008 2020-09-13 08:51:16 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @YoungEmissary Its style/aesthetic is incredibly strong though, probably its biggest strength. Very unique art style, soundtrack is god-tier, kinda a funky jazz-type OST themed around youthful rebellion against stagnant authority
1304945266705956866 2020-09-13 08:49:30 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @YoungEmissary It's a top 5 game for me. But depends what kind of game you like. It's very anime, completely based around Jungian psychology. Has turn based combat similar to a Final Fantasy, with some Pokemon style raising mechanics, except it's with mythological gods, demons, heroes, etc
1304925468584443904 2020-09-13 07:30:50 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Ending of P5 Royal was one of the best I've seen in games. Can't recommend it enough.
1304708920817188864 2020-09-12 17:10:21 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @KolonialBarbar Just what I was thinking
1304593723582545921 2020-09-12 09:32:36 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> OR maybe don't import a ton of flammable eucalyptus trees into your state.
1304571193190682625 2020-09-12 08:03:04 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> The West died long ago. We are living in its corpse.
1304454380498964480 2020-09-12 00:18:54 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Done.  https://t.co/oJAr7nQTJT
1304242211853414401 2020-09-11 10:15:49 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @sellyourcloaka1 Hypertrophy yes, bodybuilding no
1304239595152957440 2020-09-11 10:05:25 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @echo_chamberz @annakhachiyan No, never
1304140271005978627 2020-09-11 03:30:45 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @restitutordivi Both can be good, I prefer dumbell because it forces you to use stability muscles more to keep the dumbells in the right position
1304099741421244417 2020-09-11 00:49:42 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Reporting all the hard-hitting news  https://t.co/5tYtKIsC38
1304092411019366401 2020-09-11 00:20:34 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @DeVoCompagnie Yes give me moneys
1303917824017141762 2020-09-10 12:46:49 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> So yeah, pretty sure a lust demon attacked me in my dreams last night. Perhaps the battle resumes tonight?
1303836730584375296 2020-09-10 07:24:35 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @AmericanThad My last playthrough was naked Great Club run where I immediately skipped to end of Blighttown and killed Quelaag before touching the Undead Parish. Not a single point in Vitality, just Endurance and Strength. Was pretty epic
1303807331503935488 2020-09-10 05:27:46 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @AmericanThad I saved them
1303798949443252225 2020-09-10 04:54:27 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @arirechovah Exactly, much like you would challenge each other to level up in physical fitness
1303791731574476800 2020-09-10 04:25:46 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @arirechovah I'm thinking that's what I'm gonna do going forward. I try to give time to read and soak in the material, but no one takes a year to do that if they're actually reading lmao. Now I see why libraries have return dates.
1303783535199879169 2020-09-10 03:53:12 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Huge pet peeve is when people borrow a book from you and then just hold it forever without reading it. If you don't wanna read and exercise your brain, that's your prerogative. But if you borrow a book, then read it and give it back. I don't loan my books out to be decorations.
1303752098190946305 2020-09-10 01:48:17 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @RBayes14 Vitruvian cookbook coming next week, 20 recipes for only $50!
1303747890213466113 2020-09-10 01:31:34 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @LindyFit I just do both, unbelievable athleticism coursing through me
1303526537807921153 2020-09-09 10:51:59 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Everybody gangsta till they attempt a quasi-isometric pull up
1303477856043925509 2020-09-09 07:38:32 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Grimhood Noted. you caught me at store so I picked up some glycinate and will throw out the citrate when I get home. Knew there was a reason citrate was everywhere...much appreciated friend!
1303473244020846592 2020-09-09 07:20:13 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Grimhood So no magnesium citrate? Whats the best alternative?
1303473052257320966 2020-09-09 07:19:27 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I'm quite possibly the most authentic guy on this side of Twitter  in terms of pursuing heroic ideals. 99% of y'all are just memeing. The irony-poisoning of this culture has prevented you from taking anything seriously.
1303090010854391814 2020-09-08 05:57:23 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Which is the biggest object of cope in FR Twitter?
1303079329044353025 2020-09-08 05:14:56 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Pain.
1303075769783123970 2020-09-08 05:00:48 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Facebook showed me a photo from 10 years ago today. Crazy to think about how long I've been attractive
1303046262544105478 2020-09-08 03:03:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> It's simple: If you aren't taking a magnesium supplement, you're almost assuredly deficient. Magnesium supplements are easy to find at the store for a decent price. You literally just have to buy it and start taking. So what's the holdup?
1303043336878673922 2020-09-08 02:51:55 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> You gotta learn to stop needing your food to entertain you. Gonna be a lot harder to reach your health goals if you can't handle eating "boring" or repetitive meals on a regular basis. Very modern and decadent to need variety all the time. Grow up and look at the bigger picture!
1303031093533249536 2020-09-08 02:03:16 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @restitutordivi That you're a misogynist
1302394073303724032 2020-09-06 07:51:59 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> JUST SAW A BOLT OF LIGHTNING LET'S GOOOOOOOO
1302393227631304706 2020-09-06 07:48:37 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Would you?  https://t.co/Ec6CZq5mLW
1302375523151228928 2020-09-06 06:38:16 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Mixing ballistic and overcoming isometrics together is deep esoteric fitness knowledge allowing you to unlock secret muscle fibers...few realize this.
1302280670027358209 2020-09-06 00:21:21 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @YOJIMBO_KING Which one gives cancer?
1302035724229914626 2020-09-05 08:08:01 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I legit feel like I would destroy any leftist in the world at physical combat
1301984149297823749 2020-09-05 04:43:05 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @Artsymarxist @palante_palante Being a woman you might as well not bother, as your "fascists" are overwhelmingly men and thus biologically hardwired to be stronger
1301961350084788224 2020-09-05 03:12:29 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @YoungEmissary I can't wait for this. Retvrn to Sunshine
1301961047490920450 2020-09-05 03:11:17 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @LacedNewport Interesting, where would you get just terpenes? I assume that's different than just strains of herb since it's without thc
1301951738681929728 2020-09-05 02:34:18 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> This includes fitness as well. Much of fitness involves learning proper form, new exercises, how the body works, etc. So if you can't be bothered to read and improve your brain, your physical prowess will suffer.
1301950638415392771 2020-09-05 02:29:55 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Are you pushing yourself to improve in intelligence, sleep quality, charisma, etc as hard as you do in fitness? No? Then you are barring yourself from reaching your full potential in anything.
1301946035162558465 2020-09-05 02:11:38 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> It's astounding where this culture has gone in just 10-20 yrs. I was getting Toy Story and Pokemon Happy Meals. Kids today are getting Travis Scott.
1301945602503249920 2020-09-05 02:09:55 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @PharoahMelvin Dude what the fuck is this world I was getting Toy Story and Power Rangers meals when I was a kid
1301945285178994688 2020-09-05 02:08:39 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @LindyFit Curly hair is Lindy
1301942994430504962 2020-09-05 01:59:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @ivystyleprimacy Man this kid's face angers me more than it should
1301941177172791298 2020-09-05 01:52:20 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @sunlightsabre @restitutordivi Yeah that's what he said, a faggot
1301940994426966021 2020-09-05 01:51:36 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @LacedNewport That's a good point, it pretty much is lol, CBD is too popular rn so the sellers know they can overcharge for it...typical
1301940195571437569 2020-09-05 01:48:26 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Been picking up a ton of new exercises and I've become very fond of depth jumps. Improving your ability to absorb impact and transfer it into the next movement is crucial.
1301934811116908545 2020-09-05 01:27:02 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @sellyourcloaka1 @static_surfer The only labor they should be doing
1301933486039859200 2020-09-05 01:21:46 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> This video is an archetypal encapsulation of American politics. Wimpy virtue-signaling leftoid attacks a dispassionate conservative redneck, who puts up no fight as he gets put on the ground. Anyone who refuses to fight deserves anything they get.
1301925500579913729 2020-09-05 00:50:02 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @ColonialBarbar What kind of retard just lets you hit them like that??
1301743977054388230 2020-09-04 12:48:44 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @LacedNewport I'd say so very cheap. But men should take lower doses and less often. I usually do it once a week or so. Or after a hard cardio workout or lifts where I'm going to failure, if I eat zog chow, etc. Basically just like to use it as protection against rising cortisol
1301743429542703104 2020-09-04 12:46:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @YoungEmissary I didn't think about that but...he is very reminiscent
1301724557301239809 2020-09-04 11:31:33 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> I want to be great more than I want to live. None of this is a game to me.
1301616269054169089 2020-09-04 04:21:16 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Are you waiting for the next Alexander? Or are you working to become him? I know my answer. I am closer than you think!
1301606809078304778 2020-09-04 03:43:40 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @KBULTRA0 You're wrong most of the time bruh
1301606061691019266 2020-09-04 03:40:42 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @PastorMark_____ Finally someone said it
1301605283328921605 2020-09-04 03:37:36 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> @restitutordivi Yeah, regardless of any election I'm still here working underneath the radar. And I won't be relying on votes
1301589018753331201 2020-09-04 02:32:59 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> You know what? F*ck it...face dox.  https://t.co/3FjVxSzWpa
1301568085971828739 2020-09-04 01:09:48 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Perhaps it's time to start putting butter in my coffee along with local honey
1301381016528072705 2020-09-03 12:46:27 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> Unbelievably based
1300945317345591299 2020-09-02 07:55:08 +0800 <ZephyrAugustus> You say you're an based trad warrior alpha male, yet here you are on the TL, crying about "not having GF" all day. How curious...do you need another person to give your existence meaning?
