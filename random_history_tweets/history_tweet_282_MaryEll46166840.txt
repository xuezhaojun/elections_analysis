1343471219778183168 2020-12-28 16:17:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Happy Birthday Diana!
1343471083551404032 2020-12-28 16:17:21 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I have a different take. I agree with everything you said.  However, I believe there is no limit for his capacity for evil, and that we still have to live thru his last days - anything is possible.  After that, there will still be more.
1343469541372866561 2020-12-28 16:11:13 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @Used_To_Be_GOP @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Donald Trump is a con artist.  The fact that you voted for him only means he "conned you"  Just think of it as a learning experience and move on.  There is nothing wrong with your character.
1343468969781563393 2020-12-28 16:08:57 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> That is, indeed, stunning.  We have many more deaths ahead of us, even with the vaccine - which we needed from day one.
1343468315482746881 2020-12-28 16:06:21 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Even worse, KNOWINGLY knowing what would happen.
1343092121373388805 2020-12-27 15:11:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> what   a   bunch   of   jerks
1343049995033989120 2020-12-27 12:24:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I hope someone lets him know he needs a shower and a haircut.
1343049086598049793 2020-12-27 12:20:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Politics may have had nothing to do with it - so I am waiting for this to play out a little more.
1343035899555291136 2020-12-27 11:28:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> "Let them eat cake"  That attitude did not work out too well ...
1343035402156965889 2020-12-27 11:26:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @yashar Northeast United States
1343029990149992451 2020-12-27 11:04:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I got divorced
1342749805014102016 2020-12-26 16:31:15 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> NEVER AGAIN
1342743711495704576 2020-12-26 16:07:02 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Thank God...
1342743325196095491 2020-12-26 16:05:30 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> For Donald Trump...
1342743172284354560 2020-12-26 16:04:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Quality, not quantity...
1342740744608616451 2020-12-26 15:55:15 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> OK - this is VERY interesting
1342740357268828161 2020-12-26 15:53:42 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> What is wrong with Mitch??? What a stupid thing to say.
1342740182324404224 2020-12-26 15:53:01 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> What a great crowd to hang out with...
1342739569737916417 2020-12-26 15:50:34 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> There are several American Zoos that have them.
1342734311854845953 2020-12-26 15:29:41 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I bet you are right...
1342733904474730496 2020-12-26 15:28:04 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes,  and I would bet money he still has more destruction in mind. Did anyone really think he would just walk out the door?  More to come, News at 5 -
1342577980745404416 2020-12-26 05:08:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Merry Christmas from Massachusetts
1342577447989030912 2020-12-26 05:06:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Peace and Joy to you as well.  THANK YOU for everything you have done to keep our Democracy and our people safe!
1342577188059680769 2020-12-26 05:05:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?

1341635328478687233 2020-12-23 14:42:43 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> OBNOXIOUS
1341305100480987137 2020-12-22 16:50:30 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is so true.  I feel the same way.
1341304401995177985 2020-12-22 16:47:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Purgatory is a great description - time is suspended in a world that is begging for a future.
1341293070239887360 2020-12-22 16:02:42 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Will they still live there?

1341291286343643137 2020-12-22 15:55:37 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Very sorry about your Mom.  Deepest sympathy.
1341290497210527746 2020-12-22 15:52:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @PeteButtigieg A tax deduction for electric vehicles would be an incentive.  I live in MA, worked at a major medical center, they had a charging station in the main parking garage for electric vehicles. My concern in MA: Can the car hold the charge if stuck in a blizzard?
1340911116533313536 2020-12-21 14:44:57 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The "Trump Trash Trot"
1340910730460196864 2020-12-21 14:43:25 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> What about the people??? Or, are you just in it for yourself...
1340909872091676672 2020-12-21 14:40:01 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is the heart and soul of a true hero - the doctors and nurses have born the brunt of this
1340906828633391105 2020-12-21 14:27:55 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Glad to see there are real people on the inside looking out for us - thanks!
1340905194016616448 2020-12-21 14:21:25 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> W...T...F...???????
1340904452904120320 2020-12-21 14:18:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Moms - do not give up - grandma's are behind you xxxx
1340904092399525893 2020-12-21 14:17:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Hands down - the best
1340903586939678720 2020-12-21 14:15:02 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> If you are anxious about Trump's next move - watch this - the troops are coming!!!!!!!!
1340903232500064256 2020-12-21 14:13:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> And I love the sunglasses - he should wear them whenever he talks to TRUMP.  POWER GLASSES.
1340902900332195840 2020-12-21 14:12:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Joe, longest month of my life.  Many of us have such faith in you.  Be aware - Trump is scheming every minute of the day with the worst people on earth - but you already know that.  Behind you all the way.
1340902415164432384 2020-12-21 14:10:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> An ER doctor is about as tough as it gets - All medical personnel before politicians PLEASE - this is infuriating. I carried my grandson into an ER in my arms - It was the Doctors who saved him - what would Marco Rubio do???
1340901584419614720 2020-12-21 14:07:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I am one person.  I had to stock my pantry as I cannot leave my home as I am so high risk.  I figured I spent $430 - (not a big meat eater or desserts or junk food)   I can't even begin to discuss what I have spent on INSULIN-
1340900978921529346 2020-12-21 14:04:40 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Mitch - try to feed a family for $600.
1340900812701229056 2020-12-21 14:04:01 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> $600 is a joke.  Have then been to the supermarkert?  The rents in my small town are outrageous.
1340900511608954880 2020-12-21 14:02:49 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Now that the Mar Largo community is fighting to keep Trump from returning there full time, he will fight harder and deeper and dirtier to stay in the White House.  Head's up folks, this is far, far from over (silent scream)
1340899538152939523 2020-12-21 13:58:57 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Thank you Donald Trump - you fool - for all your help and inspiration - you disowned all responsibility - on Live TV - for the crisis you could have averted.
1340899055392743424 2020-12-21 13:57:02 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> $600 will be a drop in the bucket in New England in the winter.
1340898897909170179 2020-12-21 13:56:24 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We do have a big problem - and he is still in White House scheming away - we are so not out of the woods yet - My hope is that Biden has a lot of political pull.
1340898400716398592 2020-12-21 13:54:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> White House officials - we the people know this - what are YOU going to do about it?  Step up to the plate and DO THE RIGHT THING -
1340898074013667329 2020-12-21 13:53:08 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Please read - this is from before the 2016 election
1340897100788359170 2020-12-21 13:49:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Dangerous mix
1340896826187280386 2020-12-21 13:48:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump will work this as long as he can, do anything - even glue himself to the chair.
1340895198495338499 2020-12-21 13:41:42 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @SolNataMD It's almost over. It is tragic - we will survive - it is like being at war - it will end - please hang in there - history is written to give us all hope -

1340892529290604547 2020-12-21 13:31:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> My favorite President
1340885110313390081 2020-12-21 13:01:37 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Fox News needs to get real.  Buttigieg is going to do a great job!
1340884744305831937 2020-12-21 13:00:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> HOPE IS ON THE WAY!
1339509487598755840 2020-12-17 17:55:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes, they are, indeed, a bunch of cowardly fuckers.  Many regrets will come to the surface as they lives their lives after "HIM"
1339507521183211520 2020-12-17 17:47:34 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> 900 people is not a Christmas Party,  It is a COVID party.
1339507328589160450 2020-12-17 17:46:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I hope he recovers quickly and without much suffering and pain.
1339506955912667136 2020-12-17 17:45:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Seriously, they need to get a life.
1339506251521257475 2020-12-17 17:42:31 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The hope is that once he loses his presidential immunity, The NYC DA will have enough to keep him tied up in court for years.
1339018071634284545 2020-12-16 09:22:40 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> blood lust is a good description -
1339017467633541122 2020-12-16 09:20:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I buy pocket copies of the Constitution and leave them all over and give them away.
1339016918221672449 2020-12-16 09:18:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Thank you!  He will be wonderful - you are making great choices.  The world will be a better place!
1339016732606914560 2020-12-16 09:17:21 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Congratulations! Thrilled to see you in this job.!!!  Pls take a look at Massachusetts. Getting into Boston can be a 4-hr commute &amp;, underserved by train and bus service in the state. Roads are shot in many places. More cars than road. Winter is deadly.
1339013484097527808 2020-12-16 09:04:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Nothing is perfect.  There are still many people who are fighting to make Trump the President. However, the majority of people who voted, voted for Biden.  Clear simple, proven facts: Biden won.  Trump lost. At this point, anything else is crybaby material.
1339011948273426435 2020-12-16 08:58:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Putin called Biden to congratulate him and to speculate on working on problems of mutual interest.   Eat your heart out Donald...
1339010717903691778 2020-12-16 08:53:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Righ there with ya on that

1338634242943840259 2020-12-15 07:57:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Ok - passing on
1338620151567163392 2020-12-15 07:01:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes, Where is Mr. Big Bucks?  He should be doing everything he can to help this man.
1338612217311342593 2020-12-15 06:29:57 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> yep
1338611675390423048 2020-12-15 06:27:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I have seen some categorizing in the states - medical folk first.

1338425511719170049 2020-12-14 18:08:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Because he is not so bright and doesn't understand science

1338420251306958849 2020-12-14 17:47:09 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> why did they do that?  They are dangerous.
1338418901680590848 2020-12-14 17:41:47 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Why Mitch?   Why?
1338418762282897409 2020-12-14 17:41:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I think Massachusetts is on board with this.  Our Governor trained us well. We have a current curfew now, home by 9:30 pm and up at 5:30 am. He opened up the Centrum in Worcester, a very large auditorium for hospital covid overflow beds. We are all in masks.
1338305653903912961 2020-12-14 10:11:47 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> THIS IS TERRIBLE

1338303127154548741 2020-12-14 10:01:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Someone needs to do something about this- these are "hate crimes" and Trump has opened the gates...

1338300901463830530 2020-12-14 09:52:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> President Trump: If you won the election, can you explain why almost every judge but 1 - including the supreme court has rejected your case?  I would like to see the data you are basing this on.   If you can not, please stop running around willy nilly -
1338299447848161285 2020-12-14 09:47:07 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump LOST - Biden WON - I totally agree with you - He will spin it for as long as he can -

1336176833465815040 2020-12-08 13:12:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He is so annoying and crass
1336176482805309441 2020-12-08 13:11:13 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> A tremendous loss for all of us.
1336174692470829058 2020-12-08 13:04:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I think you are correct.
1336174500799520768 2020-12-08 13:03:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes, He is a real student of History...
1335787746560970753 2020-12-07 11:26:31 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> TRUTH
1335787165482180608 2020-12-07 11:24:12 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Who are you trying to kid??? His neglect of his resonsobilty CAUSED the pandemic to spread.  He stood at a press conference and said "I take no responsibility"  Get out while you can you little fool.
1335786332078153728 2020-12-07 11:20:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> There is no plan in place, never has been, and Biden is going to have to start cold - he is up to it for sure, but how COULD Trump just leave us all out here from the get-go to figure this out ourselves and then dump a pandemic on us.  Biden can do this.
1335785446870310913 2020-12-07 11:17:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> LOL
1335773330415214594 2020-12-07 10:29:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Lesson learned?  Pick your friends well...
1335772853191536641 2020-12-07 10:27:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is a big deal - a dangerous, harmful assault on our diplomats.
1335772426148454403 2020-12-07 10:25:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He never was, never will be, history will not be kind and when he loses his presidential immunity - the legal system is going to step up.  Watch NYC DA.
1335770619275841538 2020-12-07 10:18:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The thing is, some portion of them are going to test positive. Trump will not be attending their funeral.
1335770337380798467 2020-12-07 10:17:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He is a fool.  Not a VIP. Should be charged with assault for all the people he exposed himself to.
1335769701562060801 2020-12-07 10:14:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Massachusetts curfew (9:30 pm - 5:30 am) Didn't have to happen - Trump did not care, lied, did not act.  Biden people asked for the plan, were told "There is none"
1335769131136802816 2020-12-07 10:12:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We are all hunkering down in Massachusetts.  People have to wear the mask, wash hands, curfew from 9:30 PM to 5:30 AM.  Very stressful but we ARE going to come out of this. Winter will be difficult for many.
1335766523076546560 2020-12-07 10:02:11 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Only a matter of time now...He will not be able to  hide forever - NYC DA's office waiting for Day 1.
1335759788366499842 2020-12-07 09:35:25 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I had botox injections for several years for migraine.  Helped enormously.  I have aged out of the migraines now and do not need the botox - but it was a miracle cure for me.
1335758660329467904 2020-12-07 09:30:56 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Wow - so not just the flu - hang in there
1335758108283588611 2020-12-07 09:28:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Seeing my family and friends, taking walks, going to Art Museums, Parks, and Eating Out.
1335701576116285440 2020-12-07 05:44:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I have been thinking about this.  Is really fair to hold grades against the kids who are in very challenging educational situation? Can we create reasonable options?
1335699725660598272 2020-12-07 05:36:45 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> OHHHHHHH   HOW DID SHE NOT THROW UP
1335699447771226115 2020-12-07 05:35:39 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It was gross - I saw that
1335698981469495296 2020-12-07 05:33:47 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> OK - that's a biggie - do our tax dollars cover his care?
1335698424793096198 2020-12-07 05:31:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Oh yes, then there is that - at some point, this issue will escalate to the courts.
1335697903680163843 2020-12-07 05:29:30 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Well said
1335697397641584641 2020-12-07 05:27:30 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Well, she's with the right crowd...
1335697197522964481 2020-12-07 05:26:42 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> OMG!  U caught me!
1335696600346357760 2020-12-07 05:24:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Nicely stated!
1335696309387456517 2020-12-07 05:23:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Somewhere along the line, this issue may progress to a charge some level of public danger for not wearing a mask and potentially spreading the plague even further.
1335695734411243520 2020-12-07 05:20:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Eventually, the die-hards will be forced to wear masks or be dead. Not wearing a mask does not mean you are smart, free, patriotic, or brave. It means you are in a cult of stupid, useless, aggressive defiance addressing a world-wide plague.
1335454108283756547 2020-12-06 13:20:45 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I have looked at this photo and another one - a long shot - All these people - no masks!  Are they really this stupid????
1335446477619990531 2020-12-06 12:50:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> You will be very unhappy when you catch it.
1335445943571902464 2020-12-06 12:48:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Dr. Yes
1335444024795271168 2020-12-06 12:40:41 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Good Idea
1335443949423652864 2020-12-06 12:40:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> They  have Oppositional Defiance Disorder
1335360550566580227 2020-12-06 07:08:59 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> No - They are totally dedicated to their endeavor.
1335360265240637443 2020-12-06 07:07:51 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He is attempting to do what he has always done - pull off a "Con" He cons himself first, then in full belief, he tries it on us.
1335359835710369793 2020-12-06 07:06:09 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> So bad
1335359733046407171 2020-12-06 07:05:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Madness
1335359311938277381 2020-12-06 07:04:04 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> You will not see me, only a sea of fools.
1335359195982548993 2020-12-06 07:03:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I was able to vote, in person, early in my town, for BIDEN
1335359031549059080 2020-12-06 07:02:57 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Disgusting and Delusional
1335355420353900545 2020-12-06 06:48:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> gross
1335355351097610242 2020-12-06 06:48:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Truly eternal, in Oh so many ways.
1335354271353753607 2020-12-06 06:44:02 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I do believe the Governor said NO - If this is not illegal - it should be -
1335353430009913344 2020-12-06 06:40:42 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> TOTAL TRUTH
1335352137589682180 2020-12-06 06:35:33 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> There always is a profit motive for him.
1335352012997791745 2020-12-06 06:35:04 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I just checked - every senator and congressperson representing my state of Massachusetts is a Democrat. I am going to continue to check other states.
1335350951872507906 2020-12-06 06:30:51 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I am going to check to see if any are from my state.
1335350629053722624 2020-12-06 06:29:34 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I hope so because it is on them for letting Trump DO NOTHING.
1335350311498747905 2020-12-06 06:28:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Why are you not back in DC helping to fight the virus???  A frigging ego feeding rally????
1335350012889468931 2020-12-06 06:27:07 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> 5,356 new Covid cases in Massachusetts today.  We are all in masks, most are at home, hospitals are working incredibly hard, we have excellent government leadership and still it is growing.  Donald Trump, this is on you.
1335347524790587392 2020-12-06 06:17:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Wimps
1335345530747154434 2020-12-06 06:09:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> So sorry and you are so right.
1335344834085855234 2020-12-06 06:06:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He truly does not care and that is the WORST part. He KNEW from the get-go -
1335343707067920384 2020-12-06 06:02:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He may still have some sort of presidential immunity.  However, on Day 1 of the Biden administration - I believe NYC and a long line of others will be waiting as he will not have Presidential (what a joke) immunity.  PEOPLE  ARE DEAD.
1335342919188885505 2020-12-06 05:58:56 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> You would think so &amp; he is still trying to shake people down.  Remember though, once he is out of office, that presidential protection is gone the NYC DA is waiting for him.
1335342482796785665 2020-12-06 05:57:12 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The more rope he gets, the more he hangs himself.  His absence from the Oval Office &amp; presence on the Golf Course during the pandemic says a lot about NEGLIGENCE in prevention&amp;management. I hope he will be legally challenged on this. How many more must die???
1335339723016056836 2020-12-06 05:46:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> absolutely
1335137268965797890 2020-12-05 16:21:45 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> In addition to all of t hat, I visited my PCP today - who was wearing a full face see-thru mask.  I want one - he thinks that would be a great idea.
1335136955961585665 2020-12-05 16:20:30 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> HE DOES NOT CARE
1335136537563066369 2020-12-05 16:18:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes - and he suckered all those people who think he is going to use the money to "Make America Great Again"
1335135806474903555 2020-12-05 16:15:56 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> At the same age, the nun and the nurse had to chase me thru the school to give me that shot!  We were the first one!  I hope they have my name on the Covid list - will take it as soon as it is my turn!
1335135226704564225 2020-12-05 16:13:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Jim, when you start to wear a jacket, we may take you more seriously.
1335135016855203842 2020-12-05 16:12:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trumpland is a strange place, filled with delusions, lies, and plastic surgery.
1335134816065433601 2020-12-05 16:12:00 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Interesting
1335134676508348417 2020-12-05 16:11:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes!  Remember the press conference when he declared "15 cases and declining" - He knew, that was another lie, and he had no plan, never did - never will.
1335134139926896648 2020-12-05 16:09:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Dude, you do not look tough, you look crazy
1335133928177459201 2020-12-05 16:08:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I am really looking forward to the day when we can actually begin to solve problems and move forward as a nation instead of pondering what to do about the latest Trump wrench in the works.
1334727636443160576 2020-12-04 13:14:01 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Thank you Twitter!
1334727394855415811 2020-12-04 13:13:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> My mother was a waitress.
1334725706287362049 2020-12-04 13:06:21 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We voted you out.
1334704891256836105 2020-12-04 11:43:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It is part of his "Con"
1334704803398774787 2020-12-04 11:43:17 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> March 13, 2020 - When asked if he took responsibility for the growth of the virus, Donald stated "I take no responsibility."
1334702258647396353 2020-12-04 11:33:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> yes he is fundraising - the "Con is ON"
1334396929673990144 2020-12-03 15:19:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> PEOPLE!  He KNEW!
1334396550433398785 2020-12-03 15:18:24 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> FOR DONALD "NOT MY RESPONSIBILTY TRUMP
1334395563836628992 2020-12-03 15:14:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @Hi_ItsMeMel Can you check with the Autism society?  What does your state offer?  Can you try a Go Fund Me Page - deepest compasion on this one -
1334395119714377729 2020-12-03 15:12:43 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The most important speech Trump ever could have given was to tell the Nation the truth about the virus as he knew wayyyy back how bad it was - he was too arrogant to speak about it.  He knew it was coming - he was briefed.
1334393286681878529 2020-12-03 15:05:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He gave a great speech
1334393102082170880 2020-12-03 15:04:42 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> A nightmare
1334391400222355457 2020-12-03 14:57:56 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> AMEN!
1334391333868494849 2020-12-03 14:57:40 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Has he talked about anything else but himself for months?
1334390178866196480 2020-12-03 14:53:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> A few at best - it is a cult -
1334389875987132416 2020-12-03 14:51:52 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Great article.
1334388556043853825 2020-12-03 14:46:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He will never stop spinning his "Con"
1334388344051146752 2020-12-03 14:45:47 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Fools
1334386999357284353 2020-12-03 14:40:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is a crime against humanity
1334384272698990592 2020-12-03 14:29:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The "Emperor" is truly naked -
1334383631754780673 2020-12-03 14:27:04 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Congratulations!
1333746278010904576 2020-12-01 20:14:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> That's a whole history
1333746032086233089 2020-12-01 20:13:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Right!  How dare he conceal the details of that meeting, remove the transcriber. etc.  Who doe he think he i?,
1333744436182999047 2020-12-01 20:07:08 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Someone is having fun
1333743738481483776 2020-12-01 20:04:21 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He was self-serving renegade with no finesse.
1333742410753585152 2020-12-01 19:59:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Proud Boys AGAIN?? Another Rally?  You mean you don't feel stupid yet?
1333238705348349952 2020-11-30 10:37:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I just started getting into  it!
1333238178766069760 2020-11-30 10:35:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The courts may sort him out before history does.
1333237806374789120 2020-11-30 10:33:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Congratulations!
1333237719217090567 2020-11-30 10:33:37 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I followed you when I was doing theater back in the day - You are the best there ever was!
1333237003794714624 2020-11-30 10:30:46 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Being open is not the same as safe.
1333236474028945408 2020-11-30 10:28:40 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The boot is not fun.
1333236187423789057 2020-11-30 10:27:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump knew - The Obama transition time tried to prep him for the possibility - he blew them off.  Trump is responsible for this whole thing.
1333235635226861569 2020-11-30 10:25:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> No Senator Rand, it is not interesting. I suggest you get with the program and acknowledge the voice of Americans who stood in countless lines for countless hours to vote Trump &amp; his minions out...Democracy carries more weight than conspiracy theories.
1333233279332474883 2020-11-30 10:15:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Thank you!
1333230359199281154 2020-11-30 10:04:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He also charges the Secret Service if they have to stay in one of his hotels.
1333228372902768640 2020-11-30 09:56:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> IT MULTIPLEXES OUT REAPIDLY
1333225554355613696 2020-11-30 09:45:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> too funny!
1333225149613674498 2020-11-30 09:43:40 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I agree
1332930870781603842 2020-11-29 14:14:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Head's Up America - We need to fix this.
1332930485048238080 2020-11-29 14:12:46 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I think there is more to this.  It is not about his winning as much as it is about what is going to happen to him when he loses.
1332919811093966849 2020-11-29 13:30:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Head's up - stay home, please
1332910172189184002 2020-11-29 12:52:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Truth  https://t.co/0saPD6Wi03
1332909815828525056 2020-11-29 12:50:39 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Important
1332909015421030402 2020-11-29 12:47:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> If he wanted to preserve his legacy, he would congratulate Biden and go to the inauguration.   If he does not do that, he will be forever remembered as the big baby sitting at the tiny desk.
1332907660149133313 2020-11-29 12:42:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes - NYC DA is waiting
1332906866322657280 2020-11-29 12:38:55 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Sending
1332905997342478337 2020-11-29 12:35:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> They all had to go to a special class on how not to cheat charities. Fact.
1332905754647474177 2020-11-29 12:34:30 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He also knows that Biden is not stupid...
1332905013094526978 2020-11-29 12:31:33 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The Northeast got it first - learn from what happened here and what worked and what did not - Every second now counts - Our Governor and Medical folks saved many, many lives - action now!
1332904393897877504 2020-11-29 12:29:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Totally agree -
1332904001596235776 2020-11-29 12:27:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is such a big deal!  Where is the help and focus on the unfortunate people who will be homeless, and hungry and sick and dying?  Trump is useless and this will be his legacy.
1332903471176183808 2020-11-29 12:25:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This will end up being what he is remembered for - so many have suffered and died -
1332902173525553154 2020-11-29 12:20:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I wondered who approved this or if he just impulsively put it all out there himself.
1332901627196542977 2020-11-29 12:18:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Maybe he is worried about his massive debt and the NYC district attorney.
1332898750428221440 2020-11-29 12:06:40 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is very funny!  Thanks LOL
1332898015594614785 2020-11-29 12:03:45 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I love dog guilt
1332897840964784133 2020-11-29 12:03:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes and now what next???
1332897208946057217 2020-11-29 12:00:33 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes, I periodically take a vacation day from worry. It really helps.
1332896874081214464 2020-11-29 11:59:13 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @MARCIAN2003 @NickKnudsenUS done
1332896776035176448 2020-11-29 11:58:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Let us know when you win again sparky.  At the moment you seem to be having a fantasy.
1332896119593050119 2020-11-29 11:56:13 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes, it would mean Trump is a liar and you are surprised because...?
1332895856857669633 2020-11-29 11:55:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I will not be evicted - however, the thought of it is horrifying.  We need to provide coverage for these folks asap.  Winter is upon us and we have a PLAGUE that is spreading like wildfire across the nation. Forget politics, focus on the homeless.
1332709850053308417 2020-11-28 23:36:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Was he looking in the mirror?
1332707903871053826 2020-11-28 23:28:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> A "stinging rejection"
1332707422574698497 2020-11-28 23:26:24 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I wonder if he will carve his name into the oval office desk when he leaves...
1332706884718120961 2020-11-28 23:24:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> LOL
1332706586716999681 2020-11-28 23:23:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Biden is the President - Take it or leave it.
1332706408333185025 2020-11-28 23:22:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> OK - you keep believing that and spend all your time and money doing it too. Biden is the President.
1332705919810068483 2020-11-28 23:20:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> FACTS: No one is going to ask you to recant your religion. We have separation of Church &amp; State in this country for a reason. Stop trying to tie the two together. Atheists &amp; non-Christians are also Americans. You can believe in the man in the moon in America.
1332697133376557056 2020-11-28 22:45:31 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I got mine - I always get one.
1332696809014222848 2020-11-28 22:44:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I made french toast yesterday and added chopped kale to the egg mix - it worked !
1331037607841701888 2020-11-24 08:51:09 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> done  now -
1331037516036714499 2020-11-24 08:50:47 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I agree.  He does not have the skill to write this.
1331037252684832769 2020-11-24 08:49:45 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> hmmmm
1331036664106545156 2020-11-24 08:47:24 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I'm waiting for someone (smarter than me) to give us an assessment of the damage done by Trump because he delayed delivering the White House to Pres. Biden.
1331033634049052676 2020-11-24 08:35:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> What is wrong with them?
1331033238001815554 2020-11-24 08:33:47 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Good - needed to be done.  Thanks.
1331032527952199681 2020-11-24 08:30:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> YES IT DID!!!!!!
1331032320615313408 2020-11-24 08:30:09 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Finally!
1331032238029500416 2020-11-24 08:29:49 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Thank you!  Very Funny!
1331031422203736067 2020-11-24 08:26:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It was critical that as many as possible do so!
1331030522970206209 2020-11-24 08:23:00 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Do you remember when you joined Twitter? I do! #MyTwitterAnniversary  https://t.co/16VjDlH4qa
1330739234525863944 2020-11-23 13:05:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> No Lindsey, I respected you for a long time.  However, you threw the dice and we lost.
1330738719561834497 2020-11-23 13:03:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It is dangerous to our national security to let him do this - Biden needs the intel right away.
1330738191071145987 2020-11-23 13:01:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Totally Agree
1330737860761280512 2020-11-23 13:00:04 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> No, you will not win.
1330737453217550338 2020-11-23 12:58:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Like Emperor Nero who fiddled while Rome burned...Well, we will not burn, but boy, are we pissed off.
1330736657939697664 2020-11-23 12:55:17 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes, I do love this.
1330736343186612228 2020-11-23 12:54:02 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> OMG
1330733304249724930 2020-11-23 12:41:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Donald Trump cares not for our country but for himself.  If he was a true patriot, he would graciously step aside. Obama team tried to brief him on Pandemics - he could not be bothered.
1330728764683251712 2020-11-23 12:23:55 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes, he does that -
1330727016103079937 2020-11-23 12:16:59 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> How can this not be illegal?????
1330726603031187457 2020-11-23 12:15:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I just thought I would mention that I despise what Trump is doing with this election. Selfish, unpatriotic and dangerous to put our Democracy to this test.  We will win, but who needs this -
1330725584788402178 2020-11-23 12:11:17 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump devious evil
1330724924231704582 2020-11-23 12:08:40 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> JUST GIVE IT UP DUDE!
1330724616092966913 2020-11-23 12:07:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Love ThiS!
1330722872214609920 2020-11-23 12:00:31 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It was a cult
1330721785751498752 2020-11-23 11:56:11 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> aI have that concern, but I am high risk so anxious to see how this all turns out.
1330721532499423241 2020-11-23 11:55:11 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> ME too
1330720700206886913 2020-11-23 11:51:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> No one is immune to Covid.  Do us all a favor and stay home.
1330720225478717443 2020-11-23 11:49:59 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Totally agree but hundreds of thousands are in transit as we speak.  Fools.
1330719320473825281 2020-11-23 11:46:24 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Good!  That was dangerous and disgusting!
1330718369029484544 2020-11-23 11:42:37 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> What is it about this being a death virus do people not get?
1330716886917640197 2020-11-23 11:36:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> #DeactivateTrump
1330716767962935296 2020-11-23 11:36:15 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It is scary to see what he is doing.
1330716320107728899 2020-11-23 11:34:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Perfect!
1330716052116877312 2020-11-23 11:33:24 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> That is my biggest fear - or that he drops a bomb - he has been itching to do that -
1330715570522697737 2020-11-23 11:31:30 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> THIS IS SO FUNNY!  Thank you.
1330714576044908544 2020-11-23 11:27:33 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> MA&gt;  Dem or Rep, we have great faith in our Rep. Gov, Charlie Baker.  We were 3rd worst in the USA  he brought our numbers way down.  We are on curfew now - home 10 pm to 5:30 AM. We have excellent medical care in this state. We ALL wear masks. Team effort.
1329567646401126405 2020-11-20 07:30:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> THIS&gt;&gt;IS&gt;&gt;SO&gt; FUNNY
1328893261369516035 2020-11-18 10:50:17 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> You would think there would be grounds - but he may be provocative on purpose for some horrible reason.
1328892869151698945 2020-11-18 10:48:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> jerks
1328892181944414208 2020-11-18 10:46:00 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We don't believe you Donald.  Go away.
1328892039241617408 2020-11-18 10:45:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> How unfortunate for the Republicans - not a very American way for our society to progress.
1328891248288149506 2020-11-18 10:42:17 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> no thanks
1328891119304925185 2020-11-18 10:41:47 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> great idea
1328890946067501058 2020-11-18 10:41:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He is running out of lawyers.  I really wish that someone would step up and challenge him - But yet, he still has a lot of obsessed supporters. I have to wonder what it is going to take - It seems every day he throws out a new "I dare you".
1328889242660073478 2020-11-18 10:34:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> History will not like Donald
1328888886160990212 2020-11-18 10:32:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> scary on both sides
1328888628731408385 2020-11-18 10:31:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Hang in there
1328888266960084994 2020-11-18 10:30:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Why is Donald messing with the Mafia?
1328887083004551168 2020-11-18 10:25:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Good thing Biden has been there before and is assembling a team of good, trusted people.  Donald Trump will go down in infamy and will be lucky if he escapes the NYC District Attorney.
1328886765873225728 2020-11-18 10:24:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I don't understand why someone in authority does not confront him - he is not the emperor. Presidents have been removed before...
1328845501903613960 2020-11-18 07:40:31 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Well, the people are going to have to speak up, write letters.
1328844597380976640 2020-11-18 07:36:55 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Is there a list of people who refuse to wear their masks?
1328843989437607936 2020-11-18 07:34:30 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> History is watching and taking names.
1328843608003399688 2020-11-18 07:32:59 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This round will be worse than round one.  Everyone must take care, dig in and not blow this off.  The hope will be in the vaccines and self-confinement.
1328842945362079745 2020-11-18 07:30:21 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> At some point, sooner rather than later, wouldn't an intevention be appropriate?  Just saying...
1328842614142021636 2020-11-18 07:29:02 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Someday, someone, is going to spill the beans.
1328841706595377154 2020-11-18 07:25:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Hear!  Hear!
1328631357313081344 2020-11-17 17:29:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Lower end of the range
1327862514999304192 2020-11-15 14:34:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> HAHAHAHAHA
1327862426633728008 2020-11-15 14:34:07 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Should be very entertaining
1327860871855546368 2020-11-15 14:27:56 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This helps when I do it
1327860771762614273 2020-11-15 14:27:33 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> 10 mobile morgues - more to come
1327859958172577793 2020-11-15 14:24:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Lies lies and more lies sigh
1327859334332739589 2020-11-15 14:21:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> THIS IS NOT THE FLU THIS IS A PLAGUE
1327858845587283969 2020-11-15 14:19:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Let's hear it for the Manhattan DA's Office - In January, they get to strut their stuff.  Should be almost as good as the Superbowl.
1327858151669063680 2020-11-15 14:17:08 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> If you want to live, you will wear a mask.  This is a PLAGUE not the flu.
1327857929123483653 2020-11-15 14:16:15 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> MASSACHUSETTS HERE - we were 3rd worst in the country.  Everyone masked up - obeyed everything the state asked us to do.  Masks really, really do make a difference. The "Wear Your Mask" team is the winning team.
1327856898742378497 2020-11-15 14:12:09 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This former old Bronx girl thanks you for working so hard to save NY.  I will always be from the BRONX - I am in MA now - we have a great gov. up here - we all wear masks.
1327856204375273473 2020-11-15 14:09:24 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Uh, maybe because they make some people happy - like puppies and kittens?
1327855511228837888 2020-11-15 14:06:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Chemistry.  Actually, high school. Opening a whole universe of new concepts, it just made perfect sense. Gave me a new sense of wonderment about the world. I knew every test answer.  The nuns were dumbfounded.  I have never been the same.
1327850058809749510 2020-11-15 13:44:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> NAZIS   THEY ARE NAZIS  TRUMP LOVES NAZIS HE LOVE THE PROUD BOYS REPEAT THE PROUD BOYS ARE NAZIS
1327849523675344897 2020-11-15 13:42:51 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Imagine all the other lies that will come to the surface - this is just the beginning - of the end for the Trump Regime.
1327848951253524481 2020-11-15 13:40:34 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> My trust in science has not faded.  Science was ridiculed, defamed and denied by TRUMP.  Finally, with the help of science and the heroes and heroines in hospitals and labs, we will have a fighting chance.
1327848326826487809 2020-11-15 13:38:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Because Trump loves those Nazi wannabes
1327847930192125952 2020-11-15 13:36:31 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Wow!  Maybe they will be uninvited to the MET Gala as well!!  They will be pariahs...
1327847626608349184 2020-11-15 13:35:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Proud Boys are NAZIS - THINK ABOUT THAT PEOPLE
1327846699532955649 2020-11-15 13:31:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Great comment - thanks!
1327846438139736064 2020-11-15 13:30:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> EVRY SINGLE CASE THROW OUT BY THE COURTS
1327845940787601408 2020-11-15 13:28:37 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Hell on Earth is not written up in any penal code
1327845769865547776 2020-11-15 13:27:56 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> TO MIKE PENCE:  ARE YOU PLANNING ON ANOTHER "EVERYTHING IS  FINE" speech?
1327845069798379521 2020-11-15 13:25:09 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He died of complications of Covid.  Be sure to run this by your patron saint in the White House.
1327844259047874560 2020-11-15 13:21:56 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> FYI - Step aside Donald Trump so the country can get this done asap.
1327843669672669189 2020-11-15 13:19:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> To TWITTER:  Do we not hold the Proud boys to be nothing more than modern Nazis?  Since when has Nazism become defensible free speech? A sitting President FAWNS on them and does nothing to stop them?  Excuse me...
1327843032989913089 2020-11-15 13:17:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Especially in NYC, where people suffered greatly.  I can assure you, many people will speak their minds.
1327842627874643970 2020-11-15 13:15:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Plan what you can in the meantime.  In the next few months, thousands more will suffer and die BECAUSE, that, apparently, is part of the Trump revenge agenda.
1327842135383662593 2020-11-15 13:13:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes, imagine the human suffering that will occur there!  Donald Trump could change that but he would rather withhold the "keys to the kingdom" for his own selfish reasons.  History will judge.
1327841443499679744 2020-11-15 13:10:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> To Trump and followers: The nation is held hostage. Making it difficult for Biden to plot out the plan is not acceptable. Shame on you for supporting this- it is not patriotic to be complicit in the death of THOUSANDS from the virus. SHAME...
1326834654469632001 2020-11-12 18:30:07 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Dr. Fauci is right. Listen up America - there is a plague out there and it is coming for all of us.
1326834251262783488 2020-11-12 18:28:31 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> by the time he gets there thousands and thousands will be dead
1326833568446902273 2020-11-12 18:25:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It's not funny at all - how out of touch and moronic.
1326833071577067520 2020-11-12 18:23:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump knew about the virus early on and did nothing
1326832876525121536 2020-11-12 18:23:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It will only get worse
1326832538564882432 2020-11-12 18:21:43 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Dr. Pate - from Massachusetts. We were 3rd worst in the US. Our Gov. mandated masks &amp; total shutdown. Thousand died daily across the state. It is a plague. Keep people home w masks. no gatherings of any kind, Wash hands. Stock up food. Dr. Fauci is right.
1326745789134200833 2020-11-12 12:37:00 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Better late than never, I hope, thank you to all those brave souls who faced the horrors of war.
1325928766443491328 2020-11-10 06:30:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Is anybody having a problem accessing the Internet or Facebook - asking for a friend...
1325653448126308352 2020-11-09 12:16:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> 70 million people were deceived by world-class CON ARTIST
1325652656514326528 2020-11-09 12:13:17 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> no mask
1325652261717102592 2020-11-09 12:11:43 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This was the worst
1325651122544119810 2020-11-09 12:07:11 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This was DISGUSTING
1325649798918234112 2020-11-09 12:01:56 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> WHY would anyone hate Project Lincoln
1325356054746632192 2020-11-08 16:34:42 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The story of "The Virus" will be written in History and Donald Trump will be at the core of this history.  He knew, he blew it off, he thought no one would care, he thought no one would blame him.  Define War Crime...
1325355024877293568 2020-11-08 16:30:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He is "willing" to concede?  The Generals will escort him out if he doesn't leave.
1325354484160212992 2020-11-08 16:28:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is true!
1325353538546003969 2020-11-08 16:24:42 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Take a look at the stats in Massachusetts and know that our Governor has done an incredible job of controlling it.  The fact is - it is a Plague.
1325353107652546560 2020-11-08 16:22:59 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Please people, wear your masks, practice safe distancing - it is not forever - but the alternative is.
1325352532550553600 2020-11-08 16:20:42 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I have a big concern about that but I bet the Generals quietly change them,
1325352132476809216 2020-11-08 16:19:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is not good
1325351443629559808 2020-11-08 16:16:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Right?  I  have expended more energy on him then my housekeeping and I now may actually clean this place. Whew!
1325351063894044672 2020-11-08 16:14:52 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Well, I hope someone is watching him.
1325350924391489536 2020-11-08 16:14:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I read that if he refuses to leave, the generals will politely escort him out.
1325350449579515905 2020-11-08 16:12:25 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I stopped following him a while back - could not handle his hateful self.
1325350272173043712 2020-11-08 16:11:43 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Ah, No, never...
1325349993285349376 2020-11-08 16:10:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I am concerned about this, as well.
1325349228642766849 2020-11-08 16:07:34 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> me too
1325349049814446080 2020-11-08 16:06:51 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I actually feel my shoulders dropping from my ears - job well done!

1325348613892038657 2020-11-08 16:05:07 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It is a great relief to know we have not lost our beautiful Democracy - the whole world rejoices!
1325237868730658816 2020-11-08 08:45:04 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> For his golf dues?
1325209494427742208 2020-11-08 06:52:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> That is a lot of money for nothing
1325208764333649920 2020-11-08 06:49:25 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He did a great job - well thought out measured comments and responses.  An adult is back in the White House.
1325206345356816384 2020-11-08 06:39:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Curious:  Where is Pence?
1325205105709232128 2020-11-08 06:34:52 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> No kidding - I am sure there will surprises and lies ahead of us.
1325204925928902657 2020-11-08 06:34:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We can all discuss suggestions for how to rebuild the economy, fix the environment, keep restoring civil rights for one and all, repair the justice system, etc.  Endless - also - cute kitten and puppy pictures. Every now and then...

1325191253898584066 2020-11-08 05:39:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> And congratulations to Governor Baker who has been getting us thru the whole virus experience   Best Governor ever..
1325190337422372864 2020-11-08 05:36:11 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It's fun already

1324599167910555650 2020-11-06 14:27:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Thank you Stacey Abrams!
1324597745999618048 2020-11-06 14:21:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It is very inspirational - like people did when they worked in the factories during WW2
1324597496820174849 2020-11-06 14:20:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is another great national nightmare brought to you by the King of"TV's "The Apprentice"
1324596030936129536 2020-11-06 14:14:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The Canadians are always so calming.   Thanks!
1324224700277493760 2020-11-05 13:39:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> She is such a pain
1324224024818388999 2020-11-05 13:36:25 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE

1324219881093537798 2020-11-05 13:19:57 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> very tired, but still positive for Biden - though Trump's behavior at 3 am - I was live for that - was outrageous and SCARY. Biden's positivity is catching.
1324219249846607872 2020-11-05 13:17:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> exactly
1324219197455519744 2020-11-05 13:17:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> go to sleep early tonight
1323915758578053121 2020-11-04 17:11:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> That's great because my friends and I are confessing that we are up all night on twitter and - God help us - we are not taking regular showers any more - Freaking out at 4 am -
1323914793535840257 2020-11-04 17:07:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It's like being forced to sit in a dark movie house and watch some horrible horror movie for DAYS - not to mention we now how curfews because everyone has COVID- However, I am sure it will all be fine in the morning - (sure)
1323913958219284481 2020-11-04 17:04:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Thank you meow
1323913737124929536 2020-11-04 17:03:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> GOD, are you sure?  He just did a 3 am press conference and announced he was calling the election off or something like that and was taking it to the Supreme Court - You have no idea....(silent scream)
1323911246190727169 2020-11-04 16:53:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I could use one about now!
1323898379945070592 2020-11-04 16:02:25 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Treason?  An attempted coup?
1323898265084055552 2020-11-04 16:01:57 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes - I would call it an attempt to take over the Government.  Wonder if that ultimately could be call TREASON.  hmmmm.  He had it planned - THAT is why he build the fence.
1323897762988105734 2020-11-04 15:59:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Ohhh no wonder Donald had a twinkie and wanted them to retract that.
1323897576404430849 2020-11-04 15:59:13 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> But clearly we do - Please come together with like-minded people and save us.
1323897357747032064 2020-11-04 15:58:21 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> You can buy copies of the Constitution on line for One Dollar at Amazon... A little book of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.  $1 - I buy them in bunches when I have the cash and hand them out.
1323896845588975616 2020-11-04 15:56:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Of course he will. That's why he forced the appointment of the new judge.  He thinks he is just going to buy and manipulate his way all the way thru.  The Constitution will protect us.
1323896383376707584 2020-11-04 15:54:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes, I hope everyone got to vote before they died of COVID.
1323896240795459585 2020-11-04 15:53:55 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Right on.
1323896133001846790 2020-11-04 15:53:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump's press conference right now was an attempt to perform a takeover.
1323895656537378816 2020-11-04 15:51:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> You speak the Truth.  He is reinventing reality in real-time.
1323895433568100354 2020-11-04 15:50:42 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Same here.  And BTW, my friend was screamed at today because he voted for Biden.  They are getting worked up and feeling more powerful.  A lot of history being written here.  The Constitution is still intact.
1323894748021694466 2020-11-04 15:47:59 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Donald?  Lying? "Alternative Facts"
1323894449085308929 2020-11-04 15:46:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Except the person in charge thinks he is a KING.
1323894241869877248 2020-11-04 15:45:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I happen to agree with you. Donald Trump has just attempted to take over the election and declare himself the winner.  As usual, he is threatening to take it to the Supreme Court.
1323872473931276290 2020-11-04 14:19:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Watch the electoral college - Biden is still pulling ahead and closer to the 270 - then it is all over -
1323871576295702528 2020-11-04 14:15:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump doesn't do math - but we do!
1323870719642619904 2020-11-04 14:12:30 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The morning will bring more.
1323870523420561409 2020-11-04 14:11:43 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is one race Trump isn't even interested in...
1323869671834198022 2020-11-04 14:08:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Thank you twitter!
1323869487293222913 2020-11-04 14:07:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Biden has 215 electoral votes leading

1323867757251874816 2020-11-04 14:00:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Spoken like a normal person.
1323867402908717059 2020-11-04 13:59:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We need this man to be President
1323867271941492738 2020-11-04 13:58:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes, and he will scream all night, and give an acceptance speech, and sue everyone around him for years.  https://t.co/usjWtVcU5R
1323867003757756416 2020-11-04 13:57:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The only Thief in this equation is Trump.
1323866839877849089 2020-11-04 13:57:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Typical - if he does this someone needs to follow it with a correction.
1323866263198801920 2020-11-04 13:54:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Paper votes being counted dum-dum
1323864185386815489 2020-11-04 13:46:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> hmmmm
1323864002993266688 2020-11-04 13:45:49 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes, I am 72 and this is REALLY a good one - can you imagine the background screaming and cursing going on in the White House on this one?
1323863056535986176 2020-11-04 13:42:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Only the beginning of the Trump attack
1323862194812030977 2020-11-04 13:38:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Not a productive comment under the circumstances - think positive.
1323861540701954048 2020-11-04 13:36:02 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump must be raging
1323860985044754433 2020-11-04 13:33:49 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes - people are susceptible to cults and think that hatred is empowering and somehow ok.
1323860727380267008 2020-11-04 13:32:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Interesting
1323860410106261504 2020-11-04 13:31:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Thank you Minnesota
1323859840603705344 2020-11-04 13:29:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Turn on the TV
1323859290885672961 2020-11-04 13:27:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Thank you Minnesota!
1323858653452128256 2020-11-04 13:24:33 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I agree
1323858508962516994 2020-11-04 13:23:59 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I am not sure that is a really good idea - maybe they should have a sit-down talk with NYC who survived drug hell back in the 60's and early 70's.  Heroin and meth wiped out lots of people.  Not the right way to solve the problem unless they set up drug rehabs all over the place.
1323857425867354114 2020-11-04 13:19:41 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Think of how many people voted by mail - MANY
1323856711074123777 2020-11-04 13:16:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Don't despair there is still time to mail your ballot...
1323855865196253187 2020-11-04 13:13:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> that''s ok - wait until they get hit by a big hurricane or tornado and he sends them paper towels.
1323855033830658049 2020-11-04 13:10:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Ok - that's great!
1323840135759278080 2020-11-04 12:10:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I hope so.
1323840021170933760 2020-11-04 12:10:31 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It ain't over 'till it's over- it going to take a few days to get to the bottom of the vote count.  I am watching the electoral college because that is where the winning numbers are. I had a glass of red wine, and I am going to just chill out.
1323838158010753024 2020-11-04 12:03:07 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Worse yet, he doesn't care and his lies got us here.
1323838002146254854 2020-11-04 12:02:30 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Maybe the water is tainted in those places
1323831933047025667 2020-11-04 11:38:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Project Lincoln
1323831846652837890 2020-11-04 11:38:02 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> They have been courageous, inspirational, and patriotic. I am very grateful to all of them.

1323828399132102657 2020-11-04 11:24:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Apprehensive but hopeful - there are a lot of ballots outside of the norm that will take a while to get to.
1323825384497045504 2020-11-04 11:12:21 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We are here
1323744483259912194 2020-11-04 05:50:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> EVERY TIME TRUMP SAYS COVID - ANOTHER PERSON DIES...
1323744088756228098 2020-11-04 05:49:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> done!
1323743838654107650 2020-11-04 05:48:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I feel the same way - thanks Lisa!
1323743696739803137 2020-11-04 05:47:45 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Let the games begin...
1323743280006369280 2020-11-04 05:46:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Heads up on the scammer info here
1323742830242734081 2020-11-04 05:44:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> How beautiful - There is a bird sanctuary in NY on Long Island and Central Park in NYC has a area as well.
1323741968896319489 2020-11-04 05:40:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> That is for sure!
1323741792815194112 2020-11-04 05:40:11 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Hooray for PA!!!!!
1323741442519478273 2020-11-04 05:38:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Very intense evening ahead
1323741147622199298 2020-11-04 05:37:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Encouraging
1323740778762539008 2020-11-04 05:36:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yeah, but if he loses, there are more of us on the same side to call him out and stop him legally - the courts have been rejecting some last-minute pushes by him to get stuff thru under the wire.  Fingers crossed!
1323739864353902592 2020-11-04 05:32:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Why is this not called out as criminal?
1323739501848649728 2020-11-04 05:31:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Truth - it is a perversion of religion
1323738561439563778 2020-11-04 05:27:21 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Another con
1323737184130764800 2020-11-04 05:21:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The voting booth, the spoken word, and the pen is mightier than the sword.
1323736864570953735 2020-11-04 05:20:37 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Anyone with a conscience could not keep reinforcing his actions.  Good for them = also, they may know a sinking ship when they see one - we can only hope - fingers crossed.
1323469661225320448 2020-11-03 11:38:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Lindsey - he is desperate to be relected
1323468243164635136 2020-11-03 11:33:12 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The judges have really been reeling him in
1323467607501082626 2020-11-03 11:30:41 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Me too!  Let's win this thing!

1323466668945924098 2020-11-03 11:26:57 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Great Comparison
1323466437583921152 2020-11-03 11:26:02 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is disgusting that he is letting this happen
1323466319837147143 2020-11-03 11:25:34 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Donald Trump does not get to decide Make every Vote count
1323465853556396033 2020-11-03 11:23:42 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> And he may leave the country because of the NYC DA
1323465708873912321 2020-11-03 11:23:08 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Maybe both - Oh the horror

1323461202551386112 2020-11-03 11:05:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> they have been at this for a few days - is it to keep him or to keep us out-
1323460615193636864 2020-11-03 11:02:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Let's see who can save their soul and speak out
1323459172139237378 2020-11-03 10:57:09 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> So - the White House is now filled with Medical Experts???
1323458446117789697 2020-11-03 10:54:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> PEOPLE PLEASE DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN - We must vote, vote, vote, drive your friends, your neighbors - help each other
1323457889122570241 2020-11-03 10:52:04 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> A CAT 4 is a tragedy
1323457222488268801 2020-11-03 10:49:25 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I have done all I can and will keep trying
1323456255445389313 2020-11-03 10:45:34 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Hang in there!
1323455251530350592 2020-11-03 10:41:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> If Trump follows thru on this outrageous order -  fires all the employees who did not vote for him - he will be sabotaging Biden.  The courts will have to step in on this one.
1323452280297918466 2020-11-03 10:29:46 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> voting - done in  person - at town hall check

1323423108439678980 2020-11-03 08:33:51 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> it is true, it is true he would not discuss it at all and the Obama team could not get him to discuss this in the transition - they had it all prepped for him.
1323422750627844098 2020-11-03 08:32:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes!   knew It! Researched it.  When he was elected and being briefed by the Obama team, they tried and tried to go over Pandemics and he would not listen - didn't have the bandwidth.
1323412813507944448 2020-11-03 07:52:57 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It really says a lot when Republican organizations and Republican politicians are giving public statements about why they are voting for Biden.
1323412348951023617 2020-11-03 07:51:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> If he loses, he may be spending a lot of time with the NYC District Attorney
1323412190477602824 2020-11-03 07:50:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Know your rights

1323405740971872260 2020-11-03 07:24:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Sorry to hear this - it is more contagious than anyone can imagine. No parties.
1323405477418541056 2020-11-03 07:23:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Umm because he is a liar and a conman and will say and do anything without giving any consideration to truth and justice?  That?
1323405067567927299 2020-11-03 07:22:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I certainly do
1323404974534074369 2020-11-03 07:21:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> That is the TRUTH
1323398772207067136 2020-11-03 06:57:09 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Thanks Bob!  I actually voted in person at my town hall - early voting - whew!  You are so right - Imperative it is!  I am haunting all my friends and posting.  My son has voted as well. Most important election in my lifetime -
1323341983520358402 2020-11-03 03:11:30 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @UcantBserious11 Hey Bob, I am usually not personally confrontational-I can't find my tweet but if it was strongly worded, it had to be I was directing it at  Trump asI am not a fan of his.I do respect a person's opinions if not the same as mine-sorry if that was not clear.
1323340246122143745 2020-11-03 03:04:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Be Proud Scranton - of your native son.

1323339100712218625 2020-11-03 03:00:02 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> May God bless the White Helmets
1323338725061992448 2020-11-03 02:58:33 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> THANK GOODNESS SOMEONE IS SHOUTY _ THIS  IS A VERY SHOUTY ISSUE - STAY SHOUTY UNTIL WE KNOW - I VOTED
1323338467183599618 2020-11-03 02:57:31 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I lived thru this as a kid and it was not fun going to sleep in the winter with your coat and boots on.
1323338161146236929 2020-11-03 02:56:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Maybe you borrowed millions of dollars
1323337759440949248 2020-11-03 02:54:42 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It was very slimy not to grant this woman her dying wish - she knew the devil in the room.
1323336978012770313 2020-11-03 02:51:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The most important thing is that you vote.  We cannot build our country or restore it if we just sit back and not vote. I do believe you are a patriot who is following his path to get us out of this.
1323336359231262720 2020-11-03 02:49:09 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> TRUTH
1323336280969777153 2020-11-03 02:48:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Please - if you have not voted - try as hard as you can to do so.  At 72, I can say this is the most important election of my life.  Make it yours because the option is horrific.
1323335925083099137 2020-11-03 02:47:25 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump lies
1323335542306648065 2020-11-03 02:45:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yeah - you guys are great.
1323335248642514947 2020-11-03 02:44:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yeah - he says he did a lot of things ...
1323335130136649728 2020-11-03 02:44:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Great description and soooo true
1323334823910510592 2020-11-03 02:43:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes indeed - what are you waiting for! Oh, I forgot - did you say the NY DA had them?
1323334606406459393 2020-11-03 02:42:11 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> good one!
1323334528895733761 2020-11-03 02:41:52 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Dr. Fauci - I ordered an "I stand with Dr. Fauci" pin online and wear it proudly.
1323334308099215360 2020-11-03 02:41:00 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Bravo!  What happened with the bus was horrifying, criminal, and totally intentional. Those drivers in the cars should be arrested.  I can't believe they can get away with that.  What next?
1323333573773008900 2020-11-03 02:38:04 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Hang in there!
1323333310072954885 2020-11-03 02:37:02 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We have to - the other option is non-negotiable
1323333040987320320 2020-11-03 02:35:57 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Dr. Fauci, I totally respect you.
1323329777793642496 2020-11-03 02:22:59 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I am sure
1323329675108732931 2020-11-03 02:22:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> No kings in America - except in Rock and Roll
1323329474306412545 2020-11-03 02:21:47 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I do like the idea of Obama back in someplace
1323328249745866754 2020-11-03 02:16:55 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Not good
1323328156699365380 2020-11-03 02:16:33 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> If this is the truth - then he is responsible for even more death.
1323327336700403712 2020-11-03 02:13:17 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Ha! got it right!
1323327180546412544 2020-11-03 02:12:40 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Isn't this the truth...
1323326905412734982 2020-11-03 02:11:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> If  you have not mailed  your ballot back:
1323326362694914048 2020-11-03 02:09:25 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> What a jerk he is - that was such a dangerous action and had to be traumatizing to those people on the bus.  This is out of control - Trump is not the bully sheriff of some town in a movie - and Rubio is a punk for doing this.
1323286779143819264 2020-11-02 23:32:08 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> If he does do that, it should not stop the count from proceeding.  If the first count shows him losing, then he is going to declare the election invalid and start screaming it is fixed and drag out the whole thing with lawsuits - seems to be his pattern.
1323286243912855554 2020-11-02 23:30:00 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> And he is also building intense fencing all around the White House. Once and if it is determined that he has lost, this could take a while, the plan as I read it, is for the Generals to escort him out.  If he wins, then 4 more years of torment.
1323285743628918784 2020-11-02 23:28:01 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I voted early, for you
1323285212818771970 2020-11-02 23:25:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Dr. Fauci has been right all along
1323284998334697472 2020-11-02 23:25:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Dr. Fauci has been spot-on thru this whole thing
1323165719006162945 2020-11-02 15:31:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is so outrageous
1323165245087637504 2020-11-02 15:29:12 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Doctors cry over patients
1323165003961290752 2020-11-02 15:28:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Agreed
1323160327970791426 2020-11-02 15:09:39 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Because, among other things, win or lose - he has no plans of leaving.
1323160122307366913 2020-11-02 15:08:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He is the doctor, he is the expert, and he is the one who knows what he is talking about.
1323159809391296515 2020-11-02 15:07:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Snot
1323159613018198017 2020-11-02 15:06:49 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It will get worse unless severe containment measures are taken.
1323158504962772993 2020-11-02 15:02:25 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Tragedy averted - Trump thinks there was nothing wrong with this - did he ever see a bus full of people turn over?
1323157715837964293 2020-11-02 14:59:17 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> In1776, an idea was born. Democracy. If we do not get it right this time, think beyond that and remember - "WE THE PEOPLE..." We are stronger together than apart. Reject divisiveness, begin anew, fix what we can. Do not forsake Hope or - Democracy. VOTE.
1323152598506053633 2020-11-02 14:38:57 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Pete, Thank you for your courageous voice thru all of this.
1323042459950157824 2020-11-02 07:21:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> jerk
1323042287539101696 2020-11-02 07:20:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I understand it will be the Generals who escort him out if he refuses to leave.
1323042018558357508 2020-11-02 07:19:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We love Dr. Fauci - he is speaking the truth
1323041604802891785 2020-11-02 07:17:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I hope this does not go unpunished - this is not free speech-this is a dangerous criminal action.
1323040695679098884 2020-11-02 07:14:17 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> TRUTH
1323040624187199488 2020-11-02 07:14:00 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Good one - pure, honest TRUTH.
1323040477575290880 2020-11-02 07:13:25 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He would love this crap
1323040199719473154 2020-11-02 07:12:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The horror
1323039889676505089 2020-11-02 07:11:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I worked w someone who could not get his parents out.  One day, I held his hand &amp; we said nothing &amp; cried together.  I do not know the ending to his story &amp; it will haunt me forever.  War is truly hell.
1323039029219201028 2020-11-02 07:07:40 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Reassuring, thanks
1323038817046138880 2020-11-02 07:06:49 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Pjeennie - Totally agree.  What about the babies, the kids, the pregnant women, the elderly. the diabetics, etc. that are now stuck in cars on a scary bridge. In the rain. In the cold. With screaming crazy people waving flags. Yes, &amp; OMG Ambulances.
1323037899714121729 2020-11-02 07:03:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I agree - I voted early as I anticipated something like this.
1323037739051343872 2020-11-02 07:02:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> good one
1323037659250495489 2020-11-02 07:02:13 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Asking:  Does the NYPD have a plan for this?????
1323037502450655233 2020-11-02 07:01:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Agreed,wholeheartedly
1323037191623348226 2020-11-02 07:00:21 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Than  you for speaking out.
1323037034152415238 2020-11-02 06:59:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is a PLAGUE. We will lose many more. Trump will wear a badge of shame in history for not listening in the transition to the Obama advisors who tried to school him on epidemics then lying when he did know.  The next few months will be hell for all of us.
1323034849985339395 2020-11-02 06:51:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> More and more Republicans are disassociating themselves from Trump.
1323034271930589185 2020-11-02 06:48:45 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> OUR LIVES DO DEPEND ON IT - WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PLAGUE THAT DID NOT HAVE TO HAPPEN BECAUSE TRUMP SAT ON IT.
1323034072004919297 2020-11-02 06:47:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> OF COURSE - IT IS NEVER HIS FAULT
1323033967830978560 2020-11-02 06:47:33 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> WE WILL NEED OUR ENERGY
1323033751698497536 2020-11-02 06:46:41 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> YET ANOTHER LIE
1323033208594833409 2020-11-02 06:44:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> THIS IS CRIMINAL - HEADS UP POLICE START TAKING PLATE NUMBERS
1323032202574237698 2020-11-02 06:40:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> WHAT A BUNCH OF DANGEROUS PUNKS - THERE ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN STUCK IN THIS
1323031971459665923 2020-11-02 06:39:37 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> WHICH BRIDGE IS THIS????
1323031479379763208 2020-11-02 06:37:40 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> THAT IS WHAT THEY SHOULD DO
1323031184922857472 2020-11-02 06:36:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> BECAUSE TRUMP HAS PERVERTED LAW AND ORDER
1323030910523052032 2020-11-02 06:35:24 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> DON'T BE SURPRISED IF IT GETS WORSE - THEY ARE JERKS
1323030622080819203 2020-11-02 06:34:15 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> THIS IS SO OUTRAGEOUS AND DANGEROUS FOR THEM TO DO THIS
1323030151458918401 2020-11-02 06:32:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> WELL, IF  YOU WERE IN A CAR OUT THERE WITH A SICK KID OR TRYING TO GET YOUR WIFE TO THE ER BECAUSE IS IN LABOR - THE NATIONAL GUARD AND aRMORED VEHICLES DO SEEM APPROPRIATE
1323029831538397184 2020-11-02 06:31:07 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> i HOPE THEY ALL GET ARRESTED
1323029528059564037 2020-11-02 06:29:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> i DOUBT IT - BUT WE WILL AVOID THE CIVIL WAR - CIVIL UNREST PERHAPS BUT NO WAR.
1323029309154623495 2020-11-02 06:29:02 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> WHAT IF YOU WERE PREGNANT OR TRYING TO GET A SICK CHILD TO A HOSPITAL - THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS..;.
1323029131433517056 2020-11-02 06:28:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> REALLY PRODUCTIVE - JERKS - SHOWS YOU WHAT HIS SUPPORTERS ACTUALLY THINK OF "LAW AND ORDER"
1323026079548874752 2020-11-02 06:16:12 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @gregolear This is so dangerous - it is criminal - people could die because of this - it is not a political "stunt" it is a "political" crime.
1323025486415613952 2020-11-02 06:13:51 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Thanks for this post - yes, deprive him of his "audience".
1323023709284818945 2020-11-02 06:06:47 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He is a kind man.
1323023603517005829 2020-11-02 06:06:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He lies, and worse, yet he believes his own lies.
1323023238486700034 2020-11-02 06:04:55 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Where is Melania?
1323023005979729926 2020-11-02 06:03:59 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He lies.  About everything.  All the time.
1323022814358720512 2020-11-02 06:03:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This may go down in history as his most notorious lie ever!
1323022033043816448 2020-11-02 06:00:07 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> There is a film of the aggression that was directed at the Biden caravan. There were no "victims" in that Trump caravan - they were there by choice to harass and intimidate - at the very least.
1323021478590369792 2020-11-02 05:57:55 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We had a multi-party system for a reason.  This is not what our forefathers wanted.
1323021206149386248 2020-11-02 05:56:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Great Post
1323021018135482368 2020-11-02 05:56:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I would do something else other than sit in that chair.  There is nothing about Putin to admire.  Does she know he is former KGB?  Does she know what the KGB under Putin did to Russians?  Would she care? I do, and it was horrible.
1323020123888881664 2020-11-02 05:52:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Come on Florida!  You can do this!
1323019872922701824 2020-11-02 05:51:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Go Sam, Go!  Thanks!!!!
1323019428804628482 2020-11-02 05:49:46 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Good one!
1323019325490536448 2020-11-02 05:49:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We made an agreement in the beginning to disagree and we just stay off the topic - Losing our friendship is not going to make a difference.  I am in sync with just about everyone else.
1323018990558564357 2020-11-02 05:48:02 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Thank you for your humanity Dr. Stanford
1323018805094875136 2020-11-02 05:47:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> How bad is this - The Party of Trump is out of control
1323016959051603968 2020-11-02 05:39:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> You are so right!  Thank you Bernie!
1323016823437201408 2020-11-02 05:39:25 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Liar Liar pants on Fire...
1323016055401402377 2020-11-02 05:36:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> To date, almost 10,000 deaths in Massachusetts
1323015445209862146 2020-11-02 05:33:57 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Informative, thanks
1323015132117688333 2020-11-02 05:32:42 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Do they not realize when they are being conned????
1323014934062682113 2020-11-02 05:31:55 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Thanks Andrew!
1323014789694660608 2020-11-02 05:31:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Most important election in my lifetime.
1323014603878637569 2020-11-02 05:30:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Looks like the current administration is running SUCH a tight ship...
1323014261136871425 2020-11-02 05:29:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Oh yes - he delivered the Plague...does that count?
1323014010590167040 2020-11-02 05:28:15 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Really, what have you gotten except ulcers and anxiety under Trump.
1323013691701403648 2020-11-02 05:26:59 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Most impactful election I can remember.
1323013353221070859 2020-11-02 05:25:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> - Remember what he did/didnot do for Puerto Rico - he abandoned them after the hurricane and finally appeared, with PAPER TOWELS. Disgraceful is one of his favorite words - he defines it...
1323012530676109318 2020-11-02 05:22:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> If he loses, he may flee the country.
1323012253420015626 2020-11-02 05:21:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Covid is real.  So sorry this has happened to your family.
1323011906681081862 2020-11-02 05:19:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Texas, the illegal &amp; dangerous action taken by some Trump supporters to harass Biden's staffer campaign bus was dangerous &amp; illegal. If yr license plates are visible, the Feds will nab you all. Technology will find you even if you removed the plates.
1323009390178377729 2020-11-02 05:09:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> If you are wondering just how bad this election is, find the film online of some Texan Trump Supporters in pickups attempting to run the Biden Bus of staffers off the road.  Ugly to see.  I found it on the  https://t.co/uwNsfNnn3D
1322380326807703552 2020-10-31 11:30:13 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The people who were closest to him are all saying the same thing...
1322379967401963525 2020-10-31 11:28:47 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> If you have not sent in you ballot in PA read this
1322379531437703168 2020-10-31 11:27:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The poor creatures of the earth...
1322378965160497152 2020-10-31 11:24:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The corner isn't even in sight for Covid.
1322378728807215104 2020-10-31 11:23:52 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> very interesting
1322378537991622658 2020-10-31 11:23:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Good catch!
1322378334874013698 2020-10-31 11:22:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Go Pete!
1322377965808820224 2020-10-31 11:20:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We have the power
1322377747314991104 2020-10-31 11:19:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Come on PA - hit a home run!
1322377517555191810 2020-10-31 11:19:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I believe
1322377046870339584 2020-10-31 11:17:11 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Please, Please, Please
1322376808877199363 2020-10-31 11:16:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Did they think he would make them immune?
1322376432643903490 2020-10-31 11:14:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Was he invited as an "Expert Speaker"?
1322375561008828418 2020-10-31 11:11:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> THE SHAME OF THE CENTURY
1322375375452835842 2020-10-31 11:10:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> WHERE IS PENCE?
1322375283387883523 2020-10-31 11:10:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> THIS IS IMPORTANT
1322374828507209728 2020-10-31 11:08:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Only Trump would say that
1322374063310938118 2020-10-31 11:05:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is a world problem
1322373787040571394 2020-10-31 11:04:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> "No Plan" is the most incredible part
1322371897422716929 2020-10-31 10:56:43 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> See my previous post to you. Remember, there are a lot of people who are not voting for him. You will not be alone in this.
1322371308152410114 2020-10-31 10:54:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> IF he wins, and he could, those of us who will feel bad will have to be sure we resist his worst impulses every step of the way. Write letters to every person in Washington who counts.  Make phone calls, support the free press. Keep voting.
1322360706763808773 2020-10-31 10:12:15 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He was the "disgraceful" one who ignored the people of Puerto Rico.
1322360407928045568 2020-10-31 10:11:04 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Well desesrved
1322360182685470722 2020-10-31 10:10:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> So inspiring!
1322360065089773568 2020-10-31 10:09:42 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Good one
1322359860659392512 2020-10-31 10:08:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Are they going to do something about that?
1322359352011927552 2020-10-31 10:06:52 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Would you marry this guy????
1322356396395028482 2020-10-31 09:55:07 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Great question - I think a lot of us know the answer - thanks!
1322354754366939138 2020-10-31 09:48:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Because she loathes being First Lady - and when she caught the virus they had to come up with something.
1322068659884490752 2020-10-30 14:51:46 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Donald Trump, you have already done great harm to our country.  Many are dead who did not have to be.  This is ON YOU...
1322068325871083520 2020-10-30 14:50:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Do we really care about this?
1322067979404804096 2020-10-30 14:49:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> me too
1322066589185904642 2020-10-30 14:43:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Obviously, he can't read or he would be reading and understanding the rising rates for Covid.
1322066316891770880 2020-10-30 14:42:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Double Please
1322065745300344833 2020-10-30 14:40:11 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The creatures of the earth are a gift to humanity
1322063730063085569 2020-10-30 14:32:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Head's Up
1322063578703237121 2020-10-30 14:31:34 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is like a horror movie - glad they were able to get him out.
1322061741849796608 2020-10-30 14:24:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Call in medical teams from your National Guard or put a plea out to other states for volunteers. Specifically - Send a list out for who and what you ASAP need. You must get this information out to other governors, The Red Cross and concerned citizens.
1322060882919235584 2020-10-30 14:20:51 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> No wonder he can't focus -
1322060614836117504 2020-10-30 14:19:47 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> So sorry to hear your news. Send you much care and hope for a good outcome.  Hang in there, and hope he does well.
1322060022449360897 2020-10-30 14:17:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> A giant Covid party...
1322059216048312321 2020-10-30 14:14:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It's infuriating that they do it on purpose too...
1322058841685696512 2020-10-30 14:12:45 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> ATTENTION:  TRUMP NOW SEIZING PRIVATE LAND
1322058516778131462 2020-10-30 14:11:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> America's sweetheart...
1322057692677087233 2020-10-30 14:08:11 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> From one Mom to another "Ladies - you need to get OVER YOURSELVES"  We are all different in many ways.  So what?
1322056325124268033 2020-10-30 14:02:45 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Not pathetic - Outrageous and Unpatriotic - Poor Leadership - the "President" should be all over this.
1322055135003115522 2020-10-30 13:58:01 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I do
1321694917131984897 2020-10-29 14:06:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> And he is truly sincere.
1321687833514512384 2020-10-29 13:38:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> good to know
1321687551774785536 2020-10-29 13:37:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> They did it - we can too!
1321686295123472384 2020-10-29 13:32:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It is far worse than the flu- it is a plague
1321685394312859650 2020-10-29 13:28:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is TRUTH:  He doesn't care that people are freezing at his rallies and needing ambulances.  He doesn't see them as people - he only sees dollar signs.
1321684766748540930 2020-10-29 13:26:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Love this
1321684598514995200 2020-10-29 13:25:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> So sorry to hear this - This is a terrible, horrible thing for you to go thru.  I early voted for Biden - We have to change the direction of this.
1321683519660318721 2020-10-29 13:21:21 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @UcantBserious11 Gosh - not YOU - Trump - sorry about that -
1321682486699634689 2020-10-29 13:17:15 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Even if that was true, it does not erase the "ORIGINAL SIN" of separating them.
1321681495124299776 2020-10-29 13:13:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It is possible
1321681135152336899 2020-10-29 13:11:52 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> They are egomaniacs
1321680707253579776 2020-10-29 13:10:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Early voted in person for Biden and so glad Pres. Obama crushed Trump in this speech.
1321680236518514688 2020-10-29 13:08:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Kindness is winning with this man.
1321679923111710722 2020-10-29 13:07:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We can only hope.
1321677121379536896 2020-10-29 12:55:55 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump's correlation of more positive tests being due to more testing is flawed and illogical.  More people are getting sick from contagion bur he clearly doesn't understand that.  Dufus.
1321676180160958465 2020-10-29 12:52:11 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Well, that would be completly outrageous - Excuse me, Generals???  Comments please...
1321675535865565184 2020-10-29 12:49:37 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> ✋
1321675307720544256 2020-10-29 12:48:43 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Well, dufus, what does it matter if they are all dead of the virus you refused to own?
1321675145417760768 2020-10-29 12:48:04 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> My mailperson is hanging in there -
1321670698172096512 2020-10-29 12:30:24 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I early voted - my town held early voting
1321670444198580224 2020-10-29 12:29:24 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> That would be EXTREMELY helpful on many levels.
1321670285762940928 2020-10-29 12:28:46 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Indeed - make note if you are holding your breath and take some deep breaths.  We are giving birth to a new future.
1321669916035080192 2020-10-29 12:27:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> And you have my vote.
1321669776620617729 2020-10-29 12:26:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The Power of Positive Thinking is not a myth
1321669582638190593 2020-10-29 12:25:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I made the decision to vote early and in person - I could not stand in the rain for hours to vote.
1321669243767803905 2020-10-29 12:24:37 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> My physician told me many people are seen for Trump Anxiety - you are not alone - I have to consciously resist it, sometimes I lose.  We have to remember that "We The People" founded this country and stick together.
1321293857498271749 2020-10-28 11:32:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @Frodo60 @mmpadellan I see the darkness - and I hope the Constitution and brave patriots will protect us.  He is a dark force.
1321292076894572547 2020-10-28 11:25:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> You are only human.  Somewhere in our lives, I think we have felt the same way. Live with it, forgive yourself if possible.  They may gift you with forgiveness.
1321291517361868801 2020-10-28 11:23:40 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> If you think you will have to wait on line for a long time to vote:  Bring a snack, water, tissues, an easy-to-read book, Earbuds, a notebook, and a pen for your to-do list.  Maybe business cards in case you make a friend. Stretch inconspicuously.
1321285001779044356 2020-10-28 10:57:47 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> true - just what they will do
1321284879393398784 2020-10-28 10:57:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It would be very nice if you would stay out of the "Peoples' Election"  Thank you very much, but please keep your ideas to yourself.
1321284103849824256 2020-10-28 10:54:13 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Well, interestingly enough, it seems that is President-imposter seems to know "jack" about what the law actually states.
1321283783950245888 2020-10-28 10:52:57 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> That's very funny and I do think it is possible he is keeping track over which issues are getting the most publicity =
1321283500931244035 2020-10-28 10:51:49 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> good one
1321282346490994689 2020-10-28 10:47:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> already voted
1321281389287919616 2020-10-28 10:43:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Art frees us!
1321280717075161088 2020-10-28 10:40:45 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> So he will have to appear as a "perp" in a court of law - nice.
1321280259396931585 2020-10-28 10:38:56 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> never again
1321279905523507200 2020-10-28 10:37:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I remember
1321279630909857793 2020-10-28 10:36:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Good one
1321279493353492482 2020-10-28 10:35:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He does, does he...
1321279300927193090 2020-10-28 10:35:08 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Oh, he hears what they say - he is not ignoring it - he just doesn't care.
1321278362548142083 2020-10-28 10:31:24 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I know of an outstanding "Community" theater group that put together a series of play readings online. Creativity has only lost the opportunity to be shared - it is still there.  Think of all the plays yet to be written!
1321277596517224449 2020-10-28 10:28:21 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Mother Earth gifts us again
1321277238281703425 2020-10-28 10:26:56 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I voted at my town hall - last week
1321275996876775424 2020-10-28 10:22:00 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> So can I.
1321275834573983745 2020-10-28 10:21:21 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> boring
1321275666206236672 2020-10-28 10:20:41 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Voting - done - last week at my town hall.
1321274317439717376 2020-10-28 10:15:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> absolutely possible and the con man part is for sure
1321170704952414208 2020-10-28 03:23:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Among other reasons. yep.  Biden is right.
1321168460190285831 2020-10-28 03:14:41 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I am horrified at the number of people who do believe his lies and those who know he is lying but still will vote for him anyway.
1321166738067783688 2020-10-28 03:07:51 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Agree
1321166676570841089 2020-10-28 03:07:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I voted early last week, at my Town Hall. There were only 3 others and myself. In and out in a few minutes, and it felt great!
1321166113833652224 2020-10-28 03:05:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> And. so far,  it is about as bad as it can get - I am sure there will be more to come.
1321153521639739392 2020-10-28 02:15:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He is still out there and I am sure he is behind quite a bit.
1321152835975827456 2020-10-28 02:12:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I already did!  Go Biden!
1321152158209855488 2020-10-28 02:09:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> No kidding - they are overrun with them
1321151880228196352 2020-10-28 02:08:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> good one
1321151788892987400 2020-10-28 02:08:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes, this can't be over soon enough...
1321149871445991428 2020-10-28 02:00:49 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I agree with everything you have said.
1321149444394491907 2020-10-28 01:59:07 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Russia
1321142091402121218 2020-10-28 01:29:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> No, he will not - but his vocabulary and sentence structures have clearly degraded - his ability to articulate is greatly diminished today.
1321141106847948804 2020-10-28 01:26:00 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> AND all the people who died because of that.
1321140416482299904 2020-10-28 01:23:15 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I think that will lower my blood pressure, as well
1321140169861455874 2020-10-28 01:22:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I agree it should be a national holiday.  When I was working, I either had to take a requested vacation day in advance, get there online by 530 am 6 am, or be there after work until the polls closed. In the cold, in the snow, or in the rain.
1321139530511122433 2020-10-28 01:19:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Go Joe, Go!!!
1320222091258593280 2020-10-25 12:34:09 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I wear mine every day - In my area - everyone wears a  mask.
1320220761097969667 2020-10-25 12:28:52 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Lindsey, did u not see this coming?  He dumped you.
1320220413058797570 2020-10-25 12:27:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It is like a war crime
1320220176441368578 2020-10-25 12:26:33 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Who believes that?
1320219841958207488 2020-10-25 12:25:13 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is criminal - when will these families get justice?
1320219314537070592 2020-10-25 12:23:07 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Just one more lie
1320218675438379008 2020-10-25 12:20:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Most significant election in many, many years - so happy to see so many people coming out like this.
1320218342771351557 2020-10-25 12:19:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Cool

1320213792761008129 2020-10-25 12:01:11 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He is our worst nightmare.
1320213053867216896 2020-10-25 11:58:15 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> She does not look like that when she smiles.
1320212625238654976 2020-10-25 11:56:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> THE KIND OF COUNTRY THAT ELECTED DONALD TRUMP.  I WOULD LOVE TO READ HISTORY 10 YEARS FROM NOW...
1319853074186383360 2020-10-24 12:07:49 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I early voted  - it really helped me feel better.
1319852746061811712 2020-10-24 12:06:30 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Sinful
1319852617728745474 2020-10-24 12:06:00 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Maybe someone should have told them you don't have to catch Covid to get into heaven...
1319850717805424640 2020-10-24 11:58:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> THANK YOU - I have been all over that one - it is true - the Obama team tried to pin him down during the transition and he did not have the attention span or interest to sit with them and go over the pandemic plans and materials - "Just in case" -
1319850232004464642 2020-10-24 11:56:31 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Sexist comment ALERT
1319850107701952517 2020-10-24 11:56:01 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Because Trump has a cult following - however, there are still a lot of "freedom fighters" here doing our best to take it back.
1319849813991690241 2020-10-24 11:54:51 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We are heading into the home stretch - I voted early - do it while you have to energy - I went to my town hall.  No waiting - no lines - much satisfaction!
1319848686751449088 2020-10-24 11:50:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Hang in there Dr. Fauci -I just got my "I Support Dr. Fauci" Button today and will proudly wear it everywhere I go.
1319848031769022464 2020-10-24 11:47:47 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I am very high risk - now in mask and gloves if I have to go out - no one even blinks - people are all in masks and I am seeing more gloves now as well.
1319847707826061312 2020-10-24 11:46:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Go Jaime!

1319847349859110913 2020-10-24 11:45:04 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The storm will be over soon  https://t.co/BrTidpwG3D

1319843132750630913 2020-10-24 11:28:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> If you can vote early, you will avoid lines.  In addition - not sure about this - but I think it will show up as a "trend"
1319842722405036032 2020-10-24 11:26:41 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I voted in my town hall - for the Biden Team!
1319842208300912640 2020-10-24 11:24:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> "Disloyal"???  To the "King"????

1319100158148182016 2020-10-22 10:16:00 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> All the way, from Day One - I grew up in NYC - Trump could NEVER get my vote.
1319099892967432193 2020-10-22 10:14:56 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> All the way, from Day One
1319099047580454912 2020-10-22 10:11:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Is that opinion truly representative of what our curlture of sex looks like in modern America?
1319098569610190848 2020-10-22 10:09:41 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Right there with the no
1318872067039690753 2020-10-21 19:09:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Never again
1318865973244547072 2020-10-21 18:45:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Absolutely correct.
1318865727164698624 2020-10-21 18:44:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I don't think Biden has been under investigation by the Attorney General of NYC for years now...
1318865353770962945 2020-10-21 18:42:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Let them eat cake Mitch?  The times they are a"changing...
1318864942339182595 2020-10-21 18:41:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Oh yes - is he worried they will freeze his Chinese bank accounts?
1318864708401844231 2020-10-21 18:40:24 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> You mean Trump's trying to kiss up to China did not work as they perceive him to be a "fool" and have total disregard and disdain for anything he says? Don't blame it on the Dems - Trump blew it. So, yada yada yada Kev.  He is in over his head.
1318857742027808768 2020-10-21 18:12:43 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> and humiliation
1318857325625704450 2020-10-21 18:11:04 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump needs a course in vocabulary.  Very limited, very limited.
1318856902676197377 2020-10-21 18:09:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Not necessary
1318856371358531584 2020-10-21 18:07:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> What is your point?
1318855591952060427 2020-10-21 18:04:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He loves to spend money - other people's money
1318852923712065537 2020-10-21 17:53:34 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Great. I just got mine, slept for hours, and had no idea where I had been today for quite some time.
1318852472857894914 2020-10-21 17:51:47 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I wonder if they still have more faith in Donald Trump than in medical facts.  If God gave us a brain, I would think they would want to honor that by using theirs.
1318851861055721472 2020-10-21 17:49:21 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Well, that is where their brains are, right?
1318851572672155650 2020-10-21 17:48:12 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Uh, I bet they think he is a fool.
1318851159168266240 2020-10-21 17:46:34 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I never got past it.  Even wrote to the Pope. spent days on the phone calling DC offices. A crime against humanity.  I feel the same way.
1318848628144865281 2020-10-21 17:36:30 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> She knows what she is doing and does not care.  Let them eat cake.
1318757375592091648 2020-10-21 11:33:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Tell us you are not a Russian Bot
1318755989076742150 2020-10-21 11:28:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Because he is a very experienced liar and con man.

1318754914672234497 2020-10-21 11:24:07 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Because he is terrified of them.  He knows how old he is, and it terrifies him because when he sees older people, he knows he is one of them.  He is afraid to get old because is afraid to die of a senior related illness or issue.
1318753947893510144 2020-10-21 11:20:17 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We know who you are, and we know what you did.
1318753663695937536 2020-10-21 11:19:09 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> A con artist crybaby about to be revealed before the whole world.
1318593165281120258 2020-10-21 00:41:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes🙋
1318592661931151362 2020-10-21 00:39:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes indeed.  I try not to engage with them in person as they become loud and obnoxious and angry.  If they are a close friend, we have agreed to disagree and take it no further and stay off-topic.
1318588027057410049 2020-10-21 00:20:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> VACATION. I WONDER HOW MANY DIED DURING THEIR "VACATION" - BUT WORSE - WHAT IS HE LAUGHING AT???
1318049587815395330 2020-10-19 12:41:24 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> 97 percent - I took an evening course in auto mechanics for women several years ago.
1318049336429846528 2020-10-19 12:40:24 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> 97 percent - not bad
1318037177784324096 2020-10-19 11:52:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Not likely, but she is a victim of a con artist.
1318036899357986817 2020-10-19 11:50:59 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> One of my friends is a Trumper.   We simply stay off the topic. Trump will be long gone, we will have voted our separate ways, &amp; I will have my friend when all is said and done.  The truth will win out in the end. People make mistakes.  She has been conned.
1318033646629146632 2020-10-19 11:38:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I am a senior and if I have to be carried in to vote. I will cast my vote for Biden.
1318033415241859072 2020-10-19 11:37:08 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is very important
1317147222660833284 2020-10-17 00:55:43 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Because he is medically clueless

1317145628955344897 2020-10-17 00:49:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Indeed.  The issue of the codes weighs heavily on my mind.
1317145065626734594 2020-10-17 00:47:09 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I hope this tragic issue will be resolved   https://t.co/5iPSNPkff4
1316956133169500162 2020-10-16 12:16:24 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He really engendered confidence - dare to hope again!

1316953453671972864 2020-10-16 12:05:45 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It was just about impossible for me
1316952531365396482 2020-10-16 12:02:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I can buy into this

1316836435350228999 2020-10-16 04:20:46 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> What a DISGUSTING thing for a President of the United States to say - if you are a supporter, how can you justify this????

1316620140239355912 2020-10-15 14:01:17 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> You made a really poor choice.
1316619716711133184 2020-10-15 13:59:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Addiction is a medical disease.  You fought long and had to survive it. It physically occurs in the brain and many are inherited. I congratulate you. The person who released your records was an ignorant jerk. Shame is not a medical response.
1316615487535677441 2020-10-15 13:42:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Me too.  I am bringing a cane a small little stool.

1316096171333619713 2020-10-14 03:19:13 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Truth!  Our beloved country is at high risk under this president.  Vote like it matters, because it is imperative.  Thank you Lt. Gen. James Clapper.

1316078377384673283 2020-10-14 02:08:31 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Ship of fools
1316078004787961856 2020-10-14 02:07:02 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Why not??? The rest of us do - does she read his tweets?
1316076042805825536 2020-10-14 01:59:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> What a joke
1315884357605883906 2020-10-13 13:17:33 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> wHAT A HEAD TRIP
1315880806930358272 2020-10-13 13:03:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @AuschwitzMuseum never again
1315534533551325185 2020-10-12 14:07:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> yES, LIKE ASK HIM HOW HE MANAGED TO  HOLD A RALLY AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHEN HE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT
1315533862894796800 2020-10-12 14:04:49 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> how are they getting away with this ?????
1315516237154340864 2020-10-12 12:54:46 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @BunnysMomm @soloyochapin @candle_boutique @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump @MarshaBlackburn @WhiteHouse @GOP @POTUS I have not seen it - and I am a senior.
1315514963449065473 2020-10-12 12:49:43 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @JoJoFromJerz @ProjectLincoln Oh, I do believe you. Notice how she asks for more and more money.
1315514723509698560 2020-10-12 12:48:45 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> What happened to the separation of Church and State?
1315514299964588033 2020-10-12 12:47:04 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes!  It went downhill really fast and it was ugly. Whew.
1315513925476196357 2020-10-12 12:45:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @nottherealdavey Good for you!  Hopefully, she will survive this jerk and have a reawakening and return to her senses.  The important thing is that the toxic part is no longer a part of your life.
1315513223316213762 2020-10-12 12:42:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The deception just continues - how could he be so selfish????
1315512914107928576 2020-10-12 12:41:34 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He is not a president
1315511585381773312 2020-10-12 12:36:17 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> UH, 90,000 people in a stadium is NOT a good idea.
1315511352543281152 2020-10-12 12:35:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Great suggestion!
1315511000293142528 2020-10-12 12:33:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Hang in there - wear your mask, wash your hands, avoid crowds etc.  that is all you can do.  I wish you well.
1315510288716836871 2020-10-12 12:31:08 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Massachusetts sends out a daily report on the current numbers there, and where the trend is going.
1315510025109078018 2020-10-12 12:30:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I absolutely believe that is a definite possibility.
1315509721160445953 2020-10-12 12:28:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Because he is a Trump kiss up - History will not be kind to him - and I hope someone steps up soon to help the people of Florida.
1315508339028049920 2020-10-12 12:23:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> HE IS SICK ON SO MANY LEVELS...
1315508051240255488 2020-10-12 12:22:15 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Covid is ramping up again - no one needs to put thousands of people at risk.  You are a warrior - thank you for fighting back!
1315505797045067777 2020-10-12 12:13:17 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @nottherealdavey Yes - I would advise you to not get sucked into this.  She needs to seek professional help. Hopefully, she will come to her senses.
1315504841406513153 2020-10-12 12:09:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @nottherealdavey I gave up on the keyboard as more keys kept failing.  Bit the bullet and have a new keyboard!  Thanks so much for your help and advice. Stay well -
1315143650968588289 2020-10-11 12:14:15 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Are you kidding??? He is KILLING us out  here...
1315143493485047808 2020-10-11 12:13:37 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> How presidential = We are just wrapping up the fourth year of "The Trump Presidential Reality Show"!
1314431004061429767 2020-10-09 13:02:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Blame Blame Blame
1314430854576439296 2020-10-09 13:01:51 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> COVID seems to be like a medieval plague.  How is this possible in our modern age?  This is a biggie. We were not prepared and even when warned our Executive Branch blew it.
1314429931435286530 2020-10-09 12:58:11 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Not only did they steal from the charity, the court made them take classes to understand that you can't do what they did.
1314419965152432129 2020-10-09 12:18:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Truman
1314419262061191168 2020-10-09 12:15:47 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I resist - I am not an Athiest
1314419004057038851 2020-10-09 12:14:45 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> What a joke -- Trump's mishandling of Covid has contributed to the death of hundreds of thousands of people.
1314386031173685249 2020-10-09 10:03:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> THAT should be a criminal act - they can store that or come up with a better plan - the oceans are already struggling - Mother Nature is not going to be happy with humans.
1314384960330104832 2020-10-09 09:59:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @mmpadellan He is on his sixth day of hospitalization for Covid -
1314297023043117065 2020-10-09 04:10:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @SteveSchmidtSES @realDonaldTrump @ProjectLincoln You are one of the best spot-on commentators out there -truly a national hero. History will reflect this.  Please keep doing all you can, you are saving people all over America.  You give me hope - senior citizen here - seen a lot - keep up the good fight!
1314296018213707782 2020-10-09 04:06:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump THINKS he is fighting with Steve S. - in reality, he probably can't even pronounce or understand half of Steve's stunning vocabulary and fantastic comments.  Go Steve!
1314295056510128133 2020-10-09 04:02:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @DailyCaller This is sooooo funny
1313674768437129218 2020-10-07 10:57:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> There are no words...
1313670242896351232 2020-10-07 10:39:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> If he is still infected at that time, it may be a moot point.  The worst days are days 7-10 when many patients relapse - considering the way he ripped his face mask off, that is a possibility.
1313669350512037889 2020-10-07 10:35:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The best yet
1313665641551978496 2020-10-07 10:21:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> good one!
1313660886775730177 2020-10-07 10:02:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Because his suck ego is more important to him than the lives and well-being of men, women and children.
1313660119843041280 2020-10-07 09:59:13 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I STATE THAT I AM RAISING MY HAND (BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO INSERT THE HAND)
1313659738417180674 2020-10-07 09:57:42 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> An intervention is needed
1313659580187017216 2020-10-07 09:57:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I agree - we have already seen enough of Trump to know who and what he is. It was disturbing.
1311148696810270725 2020-09-30 11:39:43 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Clearly your judgement is defective and crass - you may have to look that word up....
1311147454260281351 2020-09-30 11:34:47 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Absolutely.  Thank you so much.
1311119764576759813 2020-09-30 09:44:45 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump is vomiting lies
1311118322340106240 2020-09-30 09:39:02 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> good idea - this is mayhem inflicted by a  madman
1311117825889767427 2020-09-30 09:37:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Sounds like a plan - he is a disturbed unleased adolescent.
1311116195001757698 2020-09-30 09:30:34 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Donald Trump is an adolescent psycho.  Plain and Simple.
1310807162357248000 2020-09-29 13:02:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> and puts them in the front seat
1310800372080967680 2020-09-29 12:35:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> When did Putin meet Donald for the first time? Was it in private life? How many private/political meetings have been undocumented?  Why?  Does anyone in the White House know the reason/contents of those meetings? Is it unusual if there is no documentation?
1310799132680957952 2020-09-29 12:30:41 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> You got that right
1310798581524201472 2020-09-29 12:28:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Vladamir
1310798177612836864 2020-09-29 12:26:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> So, they would rather fire all the teachers rather than do everything they can do to make the classroom safe or do the classes online - someone needs a tune-up on their problem-solving skills.
1310797424622006273 2020-09-29 12:23:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> BINGO!
1310452181695373313 2020-09-28 13:32:01 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This, by far, is his worst act.  He did not speak the truth about the virus, look back - I screamed it from the rooftops - The Obama team tried to brief him regarding pandemics and he blew them off - they were relentless, and he refused to participate.
1310451287679524865 2020-09-28 13:28:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> he doesn't want to be president to "Help" us - he despises us. He just wants to stay out of jail.
1310451056174862336 2020-09-28 13:27:33 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I think this is part of the reason he is trying to mess with the election and is floating that he may not resign.  He may have more immunity in office from all of this than if he is voted out.
1310448535305949184 2020-09-28 13:17:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I voted for her and for four years, I have thought "What would Hillary have done?"
1310446477525823488 2020-09-28 13:09:21 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Hello my good friend Vladimir
1310446197660942336 2020-09-28 13:08:15 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Maybe he realized he sold his soul to the devil and helped to put the wrong person in the white house.  He may now regret that he helped him take over America and is horrified.
1310445702108110848 2020-09-28 13:06:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> So what were the felonies they were convicted of?
1310444598343471104 2020-09-28 13:01:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Never Again
1310441396407611393 2020-09-28 12:49:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> How about what we are paying for insulin even when carrying a fortune in medical insurance - wiped out my retirement cash and more.
1310440056902029313 2020-09-28 12:43:51 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> His biggest conjob yet --Being President
1310439515845206016 2020-09-28 12:41:42 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I have said from the get-go, he is a Con Man
1310431658047410176 2020-09-28 12:10:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Being very, very high risk, I survived another day without Covid so can cast my vote against Trump in November.
1310430583068262401 2020-09-28 12:06:12 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I bet he will be fed responses from wires.
1310428805962620928 2020-09-28 11:59:08 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> And so is the relentless team in the Manhattan DA's office.
1310428087658704897 2020-09-28 11:56:17 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The rest of us are too exhausted to even think about it.
1310426931519787008 2020-09-28 11:51:41 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @B52Malmet I do not know this?  Who is that?  Can you say or send a link?  Thanks for your posts - but I missed this story.
1310425337944313856 2020-09-28 11:45:21 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We have paid as a nation for this truth and everyone deserves the satisfaction of seeing him NOT get away with it.
1310425056347074561 2020-09-28 11:44:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I am physically voting at the poll - I want to experience the rush in real time.
1310424065178509312 2020-09-28 11:40:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Vladimir
1310423930654556161 2020-09-28 11:39:46 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Not sure but at some point, his bromance with Putin may be explained.
1310423278255828993 2020-09-28 11:37:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Great use of language
1310423114199769088 2020-09-28 11:36:31 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Lindsey Graham who for whatever reason, sold his soul to Trump.
1310025551676092418 2020-09-27 09:16:45 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> wHAT A JOKE HE IS
1310023247820447750 2020-09-27 09:07:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I remember when this happened - so tragic
1310022269901692930 2020-09-27 09:03:42 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @eugenegu Ignore them, block them - some of them are computer generated and not real
1310009783970340864 2020-09-27 08:14:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The Proud Boys are an intense hate group.  They hate A LOT of people. They tried to do their thing in NYC, and even little old ladies beat them with their umbrellas.
1309623972393291776 2020-09-26 06:41:01 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> me
1309622542353797121 2020-09-26 06:35:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I had that same thought
1309621952185851906 2020-09-26 06:32:59 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Completly mishandled this and let people die hoping it would go away
1309621697579024385 2020-09-26 06:31:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Horrible
1309621590976593923 2020-09-26 06:31:33 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> ?????
1309621427113426945 2020-09-26 06:30:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> No.  I am voting for Biden. End of story.
1309621162717188098 2020-09-26 06:29:51 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> great point
1309621041753358336 2020-09-26 06:29:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It was entertaining...
1309620471500017665 2020-09-26 06:27:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Do Tell - sharing with you is always a hopeful experience and a reality check- thanks for everything you have done!!!
1309619095617273857 2020-09-26 06:21:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I am wondering why they did not go
1309618666846158859 2020-09-26 06:19:56 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> ?
1309612603719680004 2020-09-26 05:55:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Because thrives on other people's pain
1309612164869742592 2020-09-26 05:54:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> perfect!
1309600304619491328 2020-09-26 05:06:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He is doing it on purpose - red alert - there will be worse to come.
1309600056190869504 2020-09-26 05:05:59 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Tracked it from the get-go in Jan. in China. I am high risk&amp;paid attention. Not like a survivalist, but alert to the dangers when it began to unfold in China. China should have told us.  We were woefully underserved by our Federal Government.
1309595461620322304 2020-09-26 04:47:43 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I was raised Catholic but have deep experience then immersed in a lot of Jewish culture thru friends and relationships.  Previous post, I ask for the proper etiquette as I do not know. If someone made the sign of the cross it was a prayer of deep respect.
1309593529971335170 2020-09-26 04:40:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> See previous post.  I am not Jewish but sang in a Jewish Choir (in Hebrew), attended services, &amp; celebrated Passover with friends. However, I do not know what you do at a Jewish wake but have sat shiva. Rabbi, What is the right thing to do?  At some point, I will need to know.
1309592240776515588 2020-09-26 04:34:55 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Well, in a  Christian religious moment, it is a way to evokes the help and blessing of God for the person who passed. Many people who are not Jewish do not know what to do and they mean no harm or offense in any way.
1309385917690503169 2020-09-25 14:55:04 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Which version?

1309383402953605123 2020-09-25 14:45:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I think he did.
1309383185399255040 2020-09-25 14:44:13 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> if you want to see appalling, watch reruns of everything he did and said the border. Watch him throw paper towels at survivors in Puerto Rico. I could write a page of appalling, but it is late now.
1309381762490011649 2020-09-25 14:38:33 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We love our vaginas and they resent that they do not have a penis.
1309381271538339840 2020-09-25 14:36:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I'll make a note of that when I shell out $6,000 for insulin pens next month because I am in the donut hole.  Yes, I have Medicare, Yes I have Insurance - they do not cover it once you land in the hole. Of course I do not have the money.
1309379952597495810 2020-09-25 14:31:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Corrupt
1309379792085626880 2020-09-25 14:30:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Maybe u should ck with yr buddy Mr. Golden Toilet Trump.
1309249256209907712 2020-09-25 05:52:02 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Think about this. It is significant.  It is a warning.  It is coming from 489 people who know more about National Security than we can imagine.    A very significant public announcement.
1309248793779593217 2020-09-25 05:50:11 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is VERY Powerful -
1309247632087363587 2020-09-25 05:45:34 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He will be very busy defending the cases brought against him by the NYC DA
1309246550204469248 2020-09-25 05:41:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Matt, as Deputy Director for communications for the Elect Trump Committee or whatever - is the BEST you could come up with?
1309246148771819526 2020-09-25 05:39:41 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> MattWolking is a Trump Plant
1309244573672243201 2020-09-25 05:33:25 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes especially if they made it up  or made it happen.
1309244310911619075 2020-09-25 05:32:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I like this explanation the best.
1309243051752202240 2020-09-25 05:27:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> How do we know it was the Democrats and not some mouse looking for fodder for his bed for the winter?    Not everthing in life is politics.
1309242023417966593 2020-09-25 05:23:17 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Sorry, but this tooooo funny - I just laughed again.
1309241233492107265 2020-09-25 05:20:09 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Being a city kid - I never met a sheriff - However, I can tell you my life was saved more than once by a cop on the beat - lived in a harsh inner city area - when the sun went down - the horror began.
1309239316133093376 2020-09-25 05:12:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> REALLY good one...
1309193624467447808 2020-09-25 02:10:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It is important for you to remember that the most violent speech and nefarious planning is coming from the Putin puppet.
1309191935089954817 2020-09-25 02:04:15 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Born and lived in the Bronx for many years - it hit the fan under our elite Mayor Lindsey. Way before this - He was interested in looking good in a Tux.
1309189439919468544 2020-09-25 01:54:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> She stays - you can go sit on a cactus and ponder what is really go own in an obvious attempt by Trump/Valdimir to take over the country.
1309188878520246272 2020-09-25 01:52:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is wrong -
1309188578870800387 2020-09-25 01:50:55 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The ability to demonstrate is a gift of our democracy - hurting each other is not. Both sides need to pull back on the violence.  It is creating fuel for the fire that Trump is lighting to incinerate our constitutional right and establish himself as a dictator.
1309178625837629444 2020-09-25 01:11:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Boy, I will have read more about that one -
1309176032059158530 2020-09-25 01:01:04 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> You may need to spend more time living it
1308986085184282625 2020-09-24 12:26:17 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He was not joking when he implied an endless term.
1308983539443077122 2020-09-24 12:16:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yep, a TrumpPunk
1308983290087518208 2020-09-24 12:15:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He is a con man - he has been doing this stuff for years - he knows how to assault the truth and manipulate the mark - he will continue to insert this into the conversation.
1308982503252819970 2020-09-24 12:12:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Agreed - The takeover is in progress- He has been planing this - I am sure with his leader - Putin -
1308980972667445254 2020-09-24 12:05:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is America
1308975145927806976 2020-09-24 11:42:49 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> HE...WAS...NOT...JOKING...HE...ALREADY...HAS A...PLAN...AND IT IS UGLY
1308972675512045570 2020-09-24 11:33:00 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> There better be a plan because he will do it come hell or high water...
1308969500642095104 2020-09-24 11:20:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> he will fight it in the courts for years, as he does with everything else.
1308960149252571137 2020-09-24 10:43:13 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Shooting Cops like this is nonproductive.
1308959149527576577 2020-09-24 10:39:15 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> "Trump Virus" works
1308956683285286919 2020-09-24 10:29:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Sure, really normal healthy response. NOT   We need a president not a dictator.
1308956246981128195 2020-09-24 10:27:43 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It was a bunch of "crazy" libs who defeated the English and established the greatest democracy on the planet.  It was a corrupt racist who brought us to our knees.  It will be a quilt of many colors, ages, and beliefs who will help us rise again.
1308953764313919488 2020-09-24 10:17:51 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @joncoopertweets @thomaskaine5 I think when I threw a twitter nutty yesterday, my underlying concern was and is RUSSIA.  If DT has to choose between jail and Russia - he is going to Russia to spill the beans.
1308496401308037120 2020-09-23 04:00:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes, and he and Our fake President, Donald Trump, LOVE each other...Good luck with 4 more years of our Shadow President, Vladamir Putin.
1308494310082523138 2020-09-23 03:52:08 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I hear you loud and clear and agree - I am forwarding out all tweets on #BountyGate and the draftdodger in chief.
1308493873698799617 2020-09-23 03:50:24 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> She lost the Presidency&amp;we got a man who knew hundreds of thousands of people would die of COVID and said NOTHING.  You have over 66,000 cases in Colorado and almost 3,000 dead - check out your own damn backyard first.  THAT is today. Wear your mask and be quiet.
1308492479155572738 2020-09-23 03:44:52 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Bountygate- if that is not treason - what is?
1308492275861909508 2020-09-23 03:44:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @lauferlaw @realDonaldTrump Attorney Laufer, You are doing a GREAT job!  Thanks!
1308491636121505793 2020-09-23 03:41:31 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He is smart enough to know a set-up when he sees one
1308490870489047041 2020-09-23 03:38:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Please get another job before it is too late.
1308490146753523712 2020-09-23 03:35:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> When it comes to what Putin may have on Trump, the possibilities will fuel multiple books.  When all is said and done, I believe he move out of this country.
1308489873767174150 2020-09-23 03:34:31 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Put it to the vote
1308489731974537223 2020-09-23 03:33:57 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> What other offensive things can he do or say??? Well, tomorrow is another day and I am sure he will think of something - I haven't checked today yet.
1308489352771665925 2020-09-23 03:32:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Disgraceful
1308489245879828480 2020-09-23 03:32:01 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Because he is Putin's lapdog
1308453038840053760 2020-09-23 01:08:08 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> boooooo
1308452023705186304 2020-09-23 01:04:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> nd it has only just begun - Round 2 will be worse.
1308451439904161792 2020-09-23 01:01:47 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> As you suggested Lindsey, using your words against you.
1308448658115956740 2020-09-23 00:50:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump contradicts himself in his own words.  Does he think we are as oblivious as he is?
1308447960427098114 2020-09-23 00:47:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> HE IS SELF SERVING AND TRUMP WAS HIS FOOT IN THE DOOR
1308446842217263109 2020-09-23 00:43:31 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> IF YOU THINK THE VIRUS IS A MADE UP DEMOCRATIC SCAM, THEN YOU WILL BE SINGING ANOTHER TUNE IN 6 MONTHS.  WEAR A MASK AND BE PREPARED AND CAREFUL.
1308446511232151558 2020-09-23 00:42:12 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> EVERYONE NEEDS TO GO HOME, PUT YOUR LIFE IN ORDER AND WEAR A MASK. THE WORST IS YET TO COME AND WE NEED HONEST, EDUCATED LEADERSHIP TO GET US THRU  AND HONEST TO GOODNESS PLAGUE.
1308446076010196994 2020-09-23 00:40:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Barack OBAMA WAS NOT PERFECT.  HOWEVER, HE DID NOT PUT BABIES IN CAGES OR NOT DO ANYTHING EXCEPT LIE ABOUT AN EPIDEMIC THAT WILL KILL HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS - AT THE VERY LEAST.
1308445095201570816 2020-09-23 00:36:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> "All women lie"  ?????  And babies in cages was ok too, right Mitch?
1308444677805355008 2020-09-23 00:34:55 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> That woman had a right to be heard. It was not a liberal mob, it was a moral issue.  FYI - did you think babies in cages was ok?  Somethings come before politics.  Morality is overlooked in this administration. Fill your conscience.
1308440753656532993 2020-09-23 00:19:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Hey James, were you on board with babies in cages?
1308440050955415552 2020-09-23 00:16:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> So Keith, I bet you felt real good about babies in cages.
1308439829760401408 2020-09-23 00:15:39 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @AngelaBelcamino @BarackObama count me in
1308438981042999307 2020-09-23 00:12:17 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump will be infringed eventually.  The Constitution was written to protect us and the office.  Why don't you go to Amazon where you buy a copy for $1 - you may find it enlightening.
1308438451520524288 2020-09-23 00:10:11 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This assumes Trump is a valid President to begin with.  NOT.
1308435936225775618 2020-09-23 00:00:11 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @krichardknight @BarackObama Eventually, there will be a new wave of Democracy.  Trumpism will go down in History as a perverted political movement.  The Constitution will prevail.  We will get a new president who does not follow a Nazi or fascist handbook.
1308435139236704263 2020-09-22 23:57:01 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Warriors for Democracy
1308426318455996416 2020-09-22 23:21:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> “perpetual-motion mania of totalitarian movements [that] remain in power only so long as they keep moving and set everything around them in motion.”    Sound familiar?  That was one of the ways the Nazis gained power.
1308203689199439873 2020-09-22 08:37:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump thinks Putin likes him.  Putin does not "Like" people - Putin imprisons, tortures and kills people.  If you are lucky Donald, he will only send you to the Gulag when he is done with you.  Putin thinks Trump is a fool.
1308203014461759490 2020-09-22 08:34:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Putin doesn't like anyone you fool.  He is using you.
1308202701289918477 2020-09-22 08:33:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> WEAR YOUR MASK
1308202193636524038 2020-09-22 08:31:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> If you are in the government, Now is the time to speak up.  If Trump wins, he will be an official dictator.  You will not be needed, you will not have a job. This is the most important time of your life.  Speak out for the rest of us.
1308199810642726913 2020-09-22 08:21:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Please prosecute asap

1308199037825409025 2020-09-22 08:18:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> How does it feel to have sold your soul?
1308198529836421121 2020-09-22 08:16:49 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> THIS!  HOW CAN  YOU VOTE FOR THIS CREATURE AGAIN??????
1308198220108107778 2020-09-22 08:15:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Putin's Puppet
1308197527548723207 2020-09-22 08:12:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> What he is doing is a distraction and he is playing with tormenting everyone as he enjoys upsetting and degrading people.  He is the consummate bully.
1308196152857198596 2020-09-22 08:07:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump's comments only cement his reputation as idiot in chief.
1308195816444776449 2020-09-22 08:06:02 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> History will judge Donald Trump for what he is - and it not a good picture at all. Hang tough America. I am a senior, seen a lot of history - and this is as close as we have gotten to a takeover - resist and VOTE.
1308195013315170304 2020-09-22 08:02:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Donald Trump is a disturbed adolescent
1308194820125528064 2020-09-22 08:02:04 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Thank you, thank you, thank you - I have read it several times - they do not care - they are forging ahead in what will eventually manifest in a serious attemped take over of the United States by Donald Trump.
1307566185240813573 2020-09-20 14:24:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Knowledge is POWERFUL
1307565959843065858 2020-09-20 14:23:12 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Wow - This is powerful.  If you are pro-life, start by wearing a mask.
1307565262078705669 2020-09-20 14:20:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Lindsey, whatever it is they have on you - do you not realize how many of us want to love you??? Please leave the dark side.
1307563777332785153 2020-09-20 14:14:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> She is a national heroine
1307563619887054848 2020-09-20 14:13:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I am in MA so no of them are here but I do beseech you to get them out if they are in your state.
1307563238662569987 2020-09-20 14:12:24 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The Lincoln Party has been heroic and I send them my $5 every month - it is all I can afford and I am staying with them.
1307562623555248128 2020-09-20 14:09:57 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> There are so many things and people that he has conspired with, including the Russians, that it will be years before it is all sorted out.
1307562188605923329 2020-09-20 14:08:13 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> ✋
1307561906773864449 2020-09-20 14:07:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Please wear your masks - the virus is rising again - and we will not have enough vaccines in time to save us all.
1307561376534192128 2020-09-20 14:05:00 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I do not mean to be sarcastic or cruel, but if you do not believe COVID can take you out,  you may be too incapacitated by November to vote.  The virus is rising again.  Wear your mask  Dem or Rep, please don't die.  Wear your masks.
1307559464229318656 2020-09-20 13:57:24 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @tribelaw @TheLatinoArabJD @BarackObama Her dying request and they will not honor it?
1307559251125174272 2020-09-20 13:56:33 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Massachusetts.  We are all working as a team on the virus. No kidding. Our Governor, a Republican, is loved by all Dems and Republicans and has been our strength. This is not  hoax.   https://t.co/wtuqowtoKk.
1307557050151514112 2020-09-20 13:47:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I have a lifelong friend living in Washington State.  My friend is for Trump - that's ok -it is their right - not my guy - but my friend thinks the whole COVID thing is completely exaggerated and thinks it is a  hoax.  Anyone? Feeling Desperate over this.
1307143689240752135 2020-09-19 10:25:15 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Good One - Thanks Mayor Bloomberg!!!
1307140737956548608 2020-09-19 10:13:32 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Why is that???? Mitch DENIED this to Obama.  History will judge one and all.  You should think about that.
1307139959841849347 2020-09-19 10:10:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Mitch, why is this ok to do for the worst president ever when you denied this to Obama?????
1307138645665689603 2020-09-19 10:05:13 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Right - he shut down Obama's nominee
1307138294648647681 2020-09-19 10:03:49 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Unkind - how about RIP?
1307137150593490945 2020-09-19 09:59:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> RIP Justice Ginsburg
1307136990383665157 2020-09-19 09:58:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> outrageous
1307121749159555077 2020-09-19 08:58:04 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is not surprising
1307117236335902720 2020-09-19 08:40:08 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> WELL SAID!!!!!
1306481751825494016 2020-09-17 14:34:57 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> And he will give you nothing in return except death from the coronovirus
1306481000864780289 2020-09-17 14:31:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Dumb is Dumb - Wear the Mask or Die
1306479551170699264 2020-09-17 14:26:12 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Learned at 3 in my Bronx neighborhood of surviviors. Never forget.
1306475763907129345 2020-09-17 14:11:09 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump can't wait to hurt people - He himself is  a PUNK
1306475437149822976 2020-09-17 14:09:52 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He has no clue
1306474962153336833 2020-09-17 14:07:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Lincoln Project
1306472131392401408 2020-09-17 13:56:43 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Donald Trump does not wear a mask because he is emotionally stuck in sullen adolescence.
1306471598719983616 2020-09-17 13:54:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We have the wrong president in place - he is not just a climate denier, he is a climate destroyer.
1306470041446166531 2020-09-17 13:48:25 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Because he is divisive
1306469762717945858 2020-09-17 13:47:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes he is and it is getting worse every time he opens his mouth.
1306468752507232257 2020-09-17 13:43:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> TRUTH - He shut down the program
1306468373551878144 2020-09-17 13:41:47 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Right there with you - she is making some poor choices
1306468127421669376 2020-09-17 13:40:49 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Maybe to some souless people, but for those of us who are raging against the darkness - every life counts.  Do not give up.
1306467707060129792 2020-09-17 13:39:09 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> So bad
1306467452101029895 2020-09-17 13:38:08 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Her moment of realization
1305017327751180288 2020-09-13 13:35:51 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is NOT A SOLUTION
1305016561070153728 2020-09-13 13:32:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Thank you for doing that
1305015759521886208 2020-09-13 13:29:37 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> puke
1305011195519303680 2020-09-13 13:11:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Is this not a crime against humanity?  What have we sunk to as a people if we do not speak out and punish those responsible for initiating this order?  Does anyone remember the ship of Jewish children we sent back to the Nazis? Please read the history books.
1305009677521039360 2020-09-13 13:05:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I have said this from the get-go - read about the build-up to 1939 in Nazi Germany.
1305009398604091394 2020-09-13 13:04:21 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> BECAUSE THEY DRANK THE KOOL AID
1305009119045324800 2020-09-13 13:03:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Great idea - he will shiver with withdrawal
1305008906486378496 2020-09-13 13:02:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Worth noting this - take precautions and be prepared.
1305008759354224640 2020-09-13 13:01:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Maybe he should make some hospital visits to the poor asthma and burn patients.
1305008572158402573 2020-09-13 13:01:04 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> And your point is what?  Are you afraid she could actually do a better job than you????? YES    SHE    CAN
1305008075934502912 2020-09-13 12:59:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I am waiting to see if someone published the corona virus stats in a week or so after them.
1305007815443058688 2020-09-13 12:58:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> You were conned. When it is over, get therapy, see a priest or reflect, and join the rest of us to rebuild the county.  We know you drank the kool - aid but welcome back - we are all Americans again.
1305007236645875712 2020-09-13 12:55:45 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> and the cult is eating it up.
1305007004260405249 2020-09-13 12:54:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I have been saying this from the get-go - the generals are going to have to get him out - win or lose.
1305005005242535936 2020-09-13 12:46:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> hahahah - good one thanks
1305004711007879169 2020-09-13 12:45:43 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> define the terms
1305004526567653376 2020-09-13 12:44:59 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> she nails him
1305001881345888265 2020-09-13 12:34:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> His father did - psychologically.  I have read his mother was horrified at his behaviours. They had to send him away to military school as he was too much of a bully for several other schools.  They hoped the military could manage him.
1305000999212519424 2020-09-13 12:30:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Biden voters are thoughtful people - Trump voters are cultists.
1304998390967791616 2020-09-13 12:20:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @Joann10446924 @stevin42 @JoyceWhiteVance Pardon, but I am afraid I do not know what you are talking about - can you tell me what stream this is ?
1304332522705350658 2020-09-11 16:14:41 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> WE CAN ONLY HOPE
1304332427305906176 2020-09-11 16:14:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> WHEN DONALD TRUMP IS OUT OF OFFICE
1304332261710594048 2020-09-11 16:13:39 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> IS THIS IS ALL PART OF A RUSSIAN BACKED ATTEMPT TO STEAL THE ELECTION AND SOME FOLKS IN DC ARE GOING TO HAVE TO STEP UP AND STEP IN -
1304331214128664576 2020-09-11 16:09:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> DONALD TRUMP IS IN CAHOOTS WITH RUSSIAN PLAIN AND SIMPLE

1304330745352278016 2020-09-11 16:07:37 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> ABSOLUTELY - THE SCARY PART IS THAT HE IS ACTING IN A MANER THAT SEEMS TO INDICATE HE THINKS OR WORSE- KNOWS THERE WILL BE NO LEGAL RECOURSE.
1304330393341001728 2020-09-11 16:06:13 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> THIS - THIS DISGRACEFUL MAN - IS THE BEST WE COULD COME UP WITH FOR PRESIDENT??? - TIME FOR A CHANGE AND INVESTIGATION.
1304330071294042112 2020-09-11 16:04:56 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> THAT IS A NAZI TACTIC - HE THINKS HE IS A DICTATOR
1304329861536808961 2020-09-11 16:04:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> NOT GOOD - AND SYMPATHIES TO HER FAMILY AND LOVED ONES
1304329640635498496 2020-09-11 16:03:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> DR, FAUCI - HANG IN THERE - WE WILL NEED YOU MORE THAN EVER.
1304329397705543680 2020-09-11 16:02:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> THANK GOD FOR THE FREE PRESS
1304329248564486144 2020-09-11 16:01:40 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> BEYOND INCOMPETENT
1304329121850437632 2020-09-11 16:01:10 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> ANYONE WHO DOES NOT WANT TO GET THE VIRUS, OR LOST SOMEONE TO IT, OR HAD IT THEMSELVES SHOULD BE SPEAKING OUT OR RESOLVING NOT TO VOTE HIM IN TO KEEP IGNORING DEATH AND SUFFERING IN AMERICA.  THIS IS LIKE A WAR CRIME.
1304328531065831424 2020-09-11 15:58:49 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> IT WAS NOT ON WOODWARD - THAT WAS SAID TO DEFLECT THAT TRUMP COMMITED THE WORST DERILECTION OF PRESIDENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE HISTORY OR OUR COUNTRY.
1304328006698258432 2020-09-11 15:56:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> MAYBE BECAUSE HE WANT MORE OF A NAZI APPROACH AND THAT REQUIRES THAT THE SOLDIERS BE WHAT  HE CONSIDERS A PURE RACE - HE IS A DISGRACE - ONE OF HIS FAVORITE TERMS - HE IS THE DEFINITION OF THE WORD.
1304327539607982080 2020-09-11 15:54:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> tHIS IS IMPORTANT, FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE FAKE WALL - WHICH IS ALREADY FALLING DOWN.
1304325724485160960 2020-09-11 15:47:40 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> INHUMANE
1304325231327219712 2020-09-11 15:45:42 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> THIS IS CORRECT. HE WILLFULLY TOOK NO ACTION, DENIED RESPONSIBILITY, LIED FOR MONTHS IN THE FACE OF MOUNTING STATISTICS OF DEATH AND HORRIBLE ILLNESS, &amp; WITHHELD AID TO THE STATES. HE DENIGRATED THE MASK. HE SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE ASAP.
1304323994162810881 2020-09-11 15:40:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> ANTHROPOLOGISTS ARE SEARCHING THRU THE ASH OF THE WESTERN FIRE, TO HELP IDENTIFY REMAINS.  WHAT IS DONALD TRUMP DOING ASIDE FROM REVEALING HIS BRILLIANT DECISION TO NOT ACT THE VIRUS?
1304323371921018880 2020-09-11 15:38:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> oK - what is trump doing about this
1304323196108365824 2020-09-11 15:37:37 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> WHAT IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOING TO HELP CONTAIN THE FIRE, SAVE THE PEOPLE AND THEIR HOMES, AND RESCUE WILDLIFE.
1304298081966534656 2020-09-11 13:57:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump Lied, People Died
1304297188013551622 2020-09-11 13:54:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Well, I cannot vote for Trump.
1304295090286927873 2020-09-11 13:45:56 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He did tell the truth because as a con artist, he was trying to figure all the angles and see how he could make it work for him.
1304294805128835078 2020-09-11 13:44:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Ok,, this is funny
1304294157024923648 2020-09-11 13:42:14 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We do indeed
1304293978666393601 2020-09-11 13:41:31 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Liar.  You love chaos - you feed on it like a vampire
1304293315085561856 2020-09-11 13:38:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump lied, people died
1304293173703958538 2020-09-11 13:38:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> and the masks?
1304292865682669568 2020-09-11 13:37:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He is so disgusting
1304292719372664833 2020-09-11 13:36:31 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> A psychic vampire
1304292277972602881 2020-09-11 13:34:46 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> GOOD question
1304292190827548672 2020-09-11 13:34:25 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> No masks - a culling
1304292056643371010 2020-09-11 13:33:53 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yeah, you heard the man-  - SHUT UP PLEASE
1304290743855480832 2020-09-11 13:28:40 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> They drank the kool aid
1304289751080591360 2020-09-11 13:24:43 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Of course not - they live in an alternative reality
1304289601780056067 2020-09-11 13:24:08 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> maybe they got the virus
1304289435924733952 2020-09-11 13:23:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He knew and he really did not care
1304289299911913473 2020-09-11 13:22:56 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> A Fanatical Cult
1304213085708787715 2020-09-11 08:20:05 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He is a very defective person.
1304212334034989057 2020-09-11 08:17:06 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Black lives have had a heavy burden since we kidnapped them, brought them here in chains, threw them overboard to right the boats in storms, raped, sold&amp;destroyed their family units. I am white. I am offended that you are offended.
1304209681087332352 2020-09-11 08:06:33 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> RIGHT!!!!! What is waiting for???? Or is still at the "What's in this for me?" stage????
1304209501122428930 2020-09-11 08:05:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I get this...
1304209409879531520 2020-09-11 08:05:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING
1304209281634504704 2020-09-11 08:04:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Great point - We know the answer - because he is a con-man who loves the "con"
1304208992328200198 2020-09-11 08:03:49 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Portland is going to need all hands on deck to fight the fire - where is the plan?  The focus must move to the fire.
1304208635690717185 2020-09-11 08:02:24 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> His famous line from his corrupt lawyer before Michael Cohen: "Deny, Deny, Deny"  - Michael Cohen was deceived and duped.  An American tragedy.
1304207891122053120 2020-09-11 07:59:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> And indirectly, murdered thru neglect and deception - a heavy charge, I know.  What else could you say about someone who did not give the public and the medical community the information they needed to formulate a plan that he should have already had...
1304207454331437056 2020-09-11 07:57:42 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> WOW
1304207362601947136 2020-09-11 07:57:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I seriously hope so - I think she can do it - I saw her go to town on TV
1304207139154599936 2020-09-11 07:56:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He has been working him since before the election - he also is reported to think him a fool. What a surprise.
1304206626480685056 2020-09-11 07:54:25 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> You've got that right!
1304206458364596225 2020-09-11 07:53:45 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He has got to be kidding - HE IS A SCAM ARTIST
1304206137001115648 2020-09-11 07:52:28 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Is there a federal plan in place to help with the fires on the West Coat?  California is in flames as in Oregon.  Washington State is on the edge - What is going to stop the fires and help these people???
1304205122449309702 2020-09-11 07:48:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He completely disowned the process KNOWING just how bad it was.
1304204952550731776 2020-09-11 07:47:46 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> And many blindless followers took him at his word - where are they now?
1304204793074847746 2020-09-11 07:47:08 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I am convinced Russia is in cahoots
1304204547217293312 2020-09-11 07:46:09 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Maybe he thinks this can be another escape pod
1304204146741055488 2020-09-11 07:44:34 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> incredibly stupid
1303945297001959424 2020-09-10 14:35:59 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This photo is a little too erie  for me...
1303943627366948866 2020-09-10 14:29:21 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> HE    DOES    NOT    CARE
1303943407895826432 2020-09-10 14:28:29 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> corruption at so many levels
1303943196842569729 2020-09-10 14:27:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @JamesFallows Nixon was not a gangster
1303942582066712576 2020-09-10 14:25:12 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> WTF?
1303940735897669633 2020-09-10 14:17:52 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I am not like Trump - He is not like ME - He is not a good human
1303938580260286465 2020-09-10 14:09:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Contact the Red Cross and the State Police - Hope for the best outcome.
1303864582251966465 2020-09-10 09:15:15 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Ship of fools
1303864176629231616 2020-09-10 09:13:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He was gambling. With people's lives. He got off on the power.
1303859540132270081 2020-09-10 08:55:13 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> good one
1303859238687715328 2020-09-10 08:54:01 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yes, he did, and he lies to you, and then you lie to us.  But I am not sure you have processed yet just how much he lies.
1303858808024903687 2020-09-10 08:52:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> #PretendPresident
1303858695525281793 2020-09-10 08:51:52 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I hope there is a trial.
1303858603988848643 2020-09-10 08:51:30 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Is there a name for this person's obvious mental disorder?
1303858174391451651 2020-09-10 08:49:47 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Well to be sure there are many who lacked the courage to speak out.  Romney stood alone - with courage and morality.  Others are beginning to speak up and the Generals are solid in their convictions to stand their ground against harm to our nation.
1303857688879783938 2020-09-10 08:47:52 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is horrible - and it is spreading as we speak.
1303857540858613760 2020-09-10 08:47:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Great answer.
1303857453751250944 2020-09-10 08:46:56 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Dear Sen. Romney,  your courage, and comments-have been greatly appreciated by many of us.
1303857063811055618 2020-09-10 08:45:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> What is still going on!  We have not yet hit the second wave, but we will.
1303856814765879296 2020-09-10 08:44:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> One morning, we will wake up, and the White House will be empty.  Russia will be emptying a plane of the former inhabitants.
1303856161645637639 2020-09-10 08:41:48 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I seriously hope the Generals are waiting in the wings on this one.
1303855947262107648 2020-09-10 08:40:56 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Yep
1303855836620632064 2020-09-10 08:40:30 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I am sure -as he is without conscience - that he does not perceive himself guilty of anything -
1303855547549188097 2020-09-10 08:39:21 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> They may be grooming him now to run
1303855321950179329 2020-09-10 08:38:27 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> fanatic
1303734227184349187 2020-09-10 00:37:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> "Play it Down"  Code words for?  "I Take No Responsibility"  Hmm- look where that delay and investment of resources to combat the spread got us...
1303733485094547459 2020-09-10 00:34:19 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I do believe she kept her underclothing from that incident and that is where the DNA is.
1303733163311669256 2020-09-10 00:33:02 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This is an incredibly important read.
1302672640600158208 2020-09-07 02:18:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Justice?
1302455489876430849 2020-09-06 11:56:01 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The calvary is organizing and coming to save us...
1302452906394824704 2020-09-06 11:45:45 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Made me cry - love does not leave without a fight -
1302450755945869313 2020-09-06 11:37:13 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The is so obsessive-that he had to go to great expense to live out his fantasy of hate is extremely ugly and questions his mental health.  Very not cool, at all.
1302448403171999747 2020-09-06 11:27:52 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Obsessively ill with hatred
1302448282753433600 2020-09-06 11:27:23 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump is obsessively ill with hatred towards President Obama
1302447538063147009 2020-09-06 11:24:26 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Run Joe!  Run!  Great work!
1302374353494048768 2020-09-06 06:33:37 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I do remember that he did that...
1302373658443292680 2020-09-06 06:30:51 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I was disgusted with the way Donald Trump, a sitting President reacted - and only, only did he react after he was severely criticized.
1301756781169905665 2020-09-04 13:39:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Please read this

1301754830550175744 2020-09-04 13:31:51 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> From 2018 - Remember this whole thing?  https://t.co/8ojpTaQe0Y
1301754273764700160 2020-09-04 13:29:38 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> What is your explanation for why he did dragged around in Europe when the others stood in the rain ?  https://t.co/8ojpTaQe0Y
1301752764406657025 2020-09-04 13:23:39 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Because Trump is a cheat
1301751929480114178 2020-09-04 13:20:20 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> We are the "Losers and Suckers" if we buy into him and re-elect him- How dare he -when he calls some of the bravest, self-sacrificing people on the earth - our military - "Losers and Suckers" - he is not morally fit to be president.
1301415384516526080 2020-09-03 15:03:01 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> This refusal to deny them is OUTRAGEOUS
1301415175095037952 2020-09-03 15:02:11 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I put my money on Cuomo
1301414443058855937 2020-09-03 14:59:16 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> No surprise at this one - encouraging cheating?
1301414110731603968 2020-09-03 14:57:57 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I think that is why he made Florida his permanent address. NYC is wise to him and Florida is full of his suck-ups who live nearby in his mini-kingdom. He will be in for a surprise when his castle is washed away due to climate change.
1301412318941773825 2020-09-03 14:50:50 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Once we get past the crisis of saving our Democracy, we are going to have to back track to saving the planet.
1301411429061406720 2020-09-03 14:47:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Exactly what is it this dude is after?  VP? More Control?  WHAT ARE IS MOTIVES?  Anyone?
1301336737357148161 2020-09-03 09:50:30 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @MollyJongFast Spicer
1301333777088684032 2020-09-03 09:38:44 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Because she has been working diligently to undo the damage Trump is doing to our country.
1301333293082832896 2020-09-03 09:36:49 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> I can't imagine what will be left of America if we do 4 more years of Trump
1301332321954660352 2020-09-03 09:32:57 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Would this action by Trump be classified as election interference?  We all need to pitch in to save our Democracy and replace him.
1301331357856079873 2020-09-03 09:29:07 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @ec_homey @ariesjill @essenviews sooo sorry to hear this - I wish you well and will think of you.
1301330867823017984 2020-09-03 09:27:11 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Outrageous, as expected from the incompetent elitist...
1301328222609694722 2020-09-03 09:16:40 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Totally Agree
1301327795210145793 2020-09-03 09:14:58 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Russia did it
1301327403105562624 2020-09-03 09:13:25 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> dream on
1301325294759030785 2020-09-03 09:05:02 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Trump is the cause and reason for the urban issues and he KNOWS he is not welcome in NYC.
1301322759591649280 2020-09-03 08:54:57 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Perhaps in his lie-infested brain
1301322413632892930 2020-09-03 08:53:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> He is trying to de-cult her
1301322159755874307 2020-09-03 08:52:34 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> yes I am✋
1301321654589632512 2020-09-03 08:50:34 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Great Information
1300924023606579201 2020-09-02 06:30:31 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> No Jay.  Everyone has the right to vote.  We should all respect our differences.  Your freedom and my freedom are a gift from our Democracy.  Vote your choice.  If we disagree - that is AOK --it creates dialog and discussion - you have freedom speech!
1300922960983846925 2020-09-02 06:26:18 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> @TRUMPGETGO PUKE
1300921407791149056 2020-09-02 06:20:08 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> So it's just plain old dementia?
1300918330027540481 2020-09-02 06:07:54 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> GO BIDEN!!!!!!!
1300917750181789711 2020-09-02 06:05:36 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Terrible
1300917480316116993 2020-09-02 06:04:31 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> It's a mix of things - including his obsession to build Trump hotels in Russia - big ones - with his name on them.
1300917108847640578 2020-09-02 06:03:03 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> The thing I find that is difficult is that it is hard to have a reasonable discussion w/o them going hostile right away - what happened to agree to disagree - or have a civil discussion of differences.
1300916487310409728 2020-09-02 06:00:35 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Really good one - Thanks!
1300915965681692672 2020-09-02 05:58:30 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Example:  Talking out of both sides of your mouth".
1300915177752330241 2020-09-02 05:55:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Hmm, who owns stock in Quest?
1300915024278544385 2020-09-02 05:54:46 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> "Only I can do this..."
1300914671101317121 2020-09-02 05:53:22 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Thousands and Thousand of LIES that continue to come out of Trump's nasty mouth
1300914378280259584 2020-09-02 05:52:12 +0800 <MaryEll46166840> Give it up already and focus on the problem at hand - STOP TRUMP
