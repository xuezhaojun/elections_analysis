Since WW2 the numbers of immigrants have soared. At first mainly West Indians, and they are now part and parcel of everyday life They integrated. Africans &amp; Pakistanis have not.

She is on so many programmes and has obviously taken over from the unfunny comedian Sue Perkins as the girl of the moment. Just as Jermaine Jenas is the latest go to boy for the public to ‘like’.

1343569956038991872 2020-12-28 22:50:14 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I suggestedthat the Prime Ministers Salary be increased to a level higher than the highest paid Public Servant. Back in1937 we find that Neville Chamberlains entitlement was £10.000. A proper salary for the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom 2021 should be £650.000 (1937 level)  https://t.co/xhAJd6yc5k

Cabinet members could be on a scale going up in stages. MP’s should get a basic salary increasing in stages.

1343238371259383810 2020-12-28 00:52:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @PhilPhi1a Well we agree to disagree.
1343233850034556929 2020-12-28 00:34:40 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @LewtonSerena5 But he has convinced you on rumour and nonsense. I would not waste a second listening to false prophets. Very surprised that you have.
1343232944488513536 2020-12-28 00:31:04 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @PhilPhi1a We shall see. But your negativity will only bring hope to the Remainers.
1343232475431133189 2020-12-28 00:29:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @LewtonSerena5 So this Jeff Taylor is the font of all knowledge ? I notice the video you refer to is was put on YouTube 22 hours ago. So he has not seen the trade deal documentation. Amazed that you felt empowered by this nonsense.
1343230067166609409 2020-12-28 00:19:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @LewtonSerena5 Have you got those details please?

1343229146865004544 2020-12-28 00:15:59 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @PhilPhi1a Money will be invested for the fishing community are well prepared for five and a half years time when the fishing transition comes to an end. New Facilities and new trawlers. Boris told us what it was.  It is a positive.

1343215108454051841 2020-12-27 23:20:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> People putting faith in the ERG. They will bluster, boring all make observations then say they will support the Gvt. Mainly because their constituents back Boris.

1343199047042146307 2020-12-27 22:16:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @StevePersonally @LewtonSerena5 Have you read the proposed deal? If not you are just trying to cause trouble. The number of political correspondents, politicians and Nigel Farage, who are backing it suggests your assessment is way off beam. Time to accept it warts and all. We are out. That is what Matters.
1343197192429953025 2020-12-27 22:09:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Boris the one to come and promise Brexit. He listened.He has brought in a new immigration system. BUT He has to reduce the numbers here already, essentially the illegals. Our traditions and way of life is under threat. Listen to the people. Photo/iris recognition ID essential

1343150865843154946 2020-12-27 19:04:55 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn Perhaps in looking for defenders Olly should concentrate on Uruguayan players and send a task force out there.
1343149849332625408 2020-12-27 19:00:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn He slouched, he shows little interest. He should be forced to watch Edison Cavani’s industry during his games, attacking, providing great passes, in defence he is all over the field. Just as that other Great Uraguagian Diego Forlan he Was a fan favourite.
1343148085942300673 2020-12-27 18:53:52 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Annlacy7 Exactly.
1343137770814930945 2020-12-27 18:12:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MartinDaubney @Emu52May @Shanefarrow2 @Unlocked_UK_ He should explain how we could fish with such a small number of trawlers had we taken back 100%. The five years six months, with the investment the Industry will be getting, gives them the time to prepare with modern facilities and new trawlers. You are just a rabble rouser.
1343135226306981890 2020-12-27 18:02:46 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn  Convince me John that Martial is a Utd player or better playing for Salzburg?

1343128833705304069 2020-12-27 17:37:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Annlacy7 Well said Ann.

1343127481675620352 2020-12-27 17:32:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BadEvilDick Actually, you may have a point. Perhaps the grandmother should consider her own beliefs. Could that be the problem?
1343124002118770694 2020-12-27 17:18:10 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Stop the programme. The Service from Llandaff Cathedral, Cardiff on BBC1 now has an ALL WHITE CHOIR. No doubt the BBC will get a call from that grandmother.
1343122376226123777 2020-12-27 17:11:43 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GrahamH87468748 Thank you Graham. It would help to level the country and move away from the Westminster bubble.
1343121409036464131 2020-12-27 17:07:52 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Someone, who because she has mixed race grandchildren, complained to the BBC that The Choir from Kings College was ALL WHITE? Did people complain about the London Tabernacle Choir being all black or similarly the excellent Kingdom Choir singing at Harry &amp; Megan’s wedding?
1343114687701987328 2020-12-27 16:41:10 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> A fair article with a sting in the tail. But very welcome.  https://t.co/hGNKKle41F
1343114030567796736 2020-12-27 16:38:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Much praise for Boris Johnson in the papers. Wouldn’t it be good if all living Former Prime Ministers who said that a deal could not and would not happen, Signed a joint letter to  @BorisJohnson , apologising for their hopelessness and negativity. And promised to zip it too!
1343112130812325888 2020-12-27 16:31:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MarkDrakeford @NhswalesW @NHSWalesDU  Have the Welsh NHS started vaccinating? Just asking. Which hospitals and Health Centres are administrating it? How many have taken place in South Wales and in North Wales? We are being treated as mushrooms. Kept in the dark etc.
1343078339779698688 2020-12-27 14:16:44 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Consider this statement. Does it not highlight the problem of why MP’s are so distrusted by the people. They listen to lobby groups in preference to their constituents. Now let us have legally binding referendums to “level up” on Immigration, Death Penalty, Abortion, Defence etc.  https://t.co/ql9GuqexYr

Unless you have read the whole deal, the full 500 Pages I suggest you hold your views. You could end up with eggs on your face.

Mr Mainer likes wearing ridiculous hats and is known for supporting lost causes. Mrs Mainer is a sad case. Once a junior Minister in government, now a social outcaste for total hypocrisy.
1342887829651783683 2020-12-27 01:39:42 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Netflix’s have a period series called ‘Bridgerton’ set it appears in the 17th Century England. Where the population, as featured, is 50/50% Black/White.The acting is so poor but it is hilarious. It is not meant to be but it is.

Your commitment to BREXIT eas solid before and after the a referendum. There are so many unsung heroes of Brexit. You are one. Thanks.
1342517840180609032 2020-12-26 01:09:30 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @DevonshireDanUK @BorisJohnson Excellent suggestion.
1342397329752653824 2020-12-25 17:10:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @TLS_Traffic_Law That was a sin!
1342397216028286976 2020-12-25 17:10:11 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn I wish you and your family, especially those in North Wales, the warmest regards this Christmas time plus a wish that 2021 sees your Lettuce Empire succeed. “Vegan Dreams” is a wonderful title. Congratulations. Hope the Nut roast and lettuce goes down well.

1342387956888313856 2020-12-25 16:33:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> This predicted text annoys me Twitter. We are NOT The United FULL STOP Kingdom FULL STOP. (U.K.) WE are the United Kingdom (UK). Please amend this insult.
1342384081322074120 2020-12-25 16:17:59 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Perhaps Mrs May Will acknowledge that she was so wrong by stating her deal was the ONLY deal in town! It wasn’t was it, but it certainly held us back. She should apologise.
1342376783690276864 2020-12-25 15:49:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ShedHender @Betty06417439 @tesssummers98 Jacob Reece Mogg stated that MP’s where Essential Workers. So why did a majority hide at home. Get back to work at the House of Commons.
1342375928115179520 2020-12-25 15:45:36 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @LordAshcroft @pam30301 Yes the BBC World Service was on full flow Remainer duty at 3am!
1342375454611828737 2020-12-25 15:43:43 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @TheresaMayMP  IT turns out there WAS another “deal in town”. I do believe you owe David Davis and his team, your party and the people of the United Kingdom an apology for your doomed attempt, plus a congratulatory speech in the House of Commons to Boris Johnson.
1342374367045554176 2020-12-25 15:39:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @sarahisitme He is in a Nunnery.
1342374039214583808 2020-12-25 15:38:05 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Listening to the BBC World Service at 3am proclaiming to the world about the EU trade deal was so Anti British. A damned disgrace, the male presenter did not obviously want to be associated with being British. @BorisJohnson  Our mouthpiece to the World needs a BORIS BOOT!
1342230710380277762 2020-12-25 06:08:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> IF Starmer and his party votes FOR the treaty and it goes wrong. HE will be as culpable as Boris.

Get behind Boris you will be amazed how well such an intervention by you will be received. Come on now. We are out, we have a deal. Give credit where credit is due.
1342180774729158660 2020-12-25 02:50:07 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> My cynicism in the past weeks was a lack of belief in our negotiators. May killed any ambition or hope for the future. I wanted @BorisJohnson to succeed. His choice of Lord FROST was a supreme choice. I have no doubt there will be moans. BUT I say it is a brilliant outcome.

1342148550965293056 2020-12-25 00:42:05 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The Treaty with the EU is much better than many people, including me, thought we would achieve. BUT if I may just remind those moaning SNP’s in Scotland, You have failed your Health Service, Policing, Prisons &amp; Education. independence without our cash would cripple you.

1342023078851858432 2020-12-24 16:23:30 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> A simple Q, but WHAT have the lorry OWNERS done for their employees trapped in their lorries in an awful situation? No toilets, no washing facilities. Basic human needs. Surely they could install a commode, a shower unit? That cannot be beyond the wit of man. @roadhaulage1 ???

1342016816982466560 2020-12-24 15:58:37 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn What a goal. But what a contribution Cavani makes. He is everywhere, in defence, attack, terrific passing. Young players should try to emulate his obvious love of the game. Rashford especially. What a goal.
1342015805110824961 2020-12-24 15:54:36 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ifneedsmust Thank you Robert.
1342000881101918208 2020-12-24 14:55:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> It does look from what we can read and listen to that the Deal is a success for @BorisJohnson and I congratulate him, Lord Frost &amp;  Micheal Gove , the whole negotiating team. It was obvious that some concession on Fishing would have to be accepted. I was wrong and I apologise.
1341856407193325571 2020-12-24 05:21:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Those that support taking to the streets play right into the old “Fascists” argument. Reform will want to attract the decent people, older people who always vote and whom voted to leave. They do not appreciate or support ridiculous marching which always attracts troublemakers.
1341853448174710787 2020-12-24 05:09:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Rob_Patriot52 @BadEvilDick True, but you take that into account from the beginning.
1341852883332030471 2020-12-24 05:07:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @PhilPhi1a @BadEvilDick I disagree. Marching on Parliament, Lobbying Parliamentarians, Stopping traffic throughout Westminster does change one MP’s mind. Local activity at their ‘surgeries’, writing to them, letters to local papers. That works. Just being organised and constant. No bad behaviour. Polite
1341844798932742145 2020-12-24 04:35:04 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BadEvilDick The streets will not help. The answer is to get behind Farage and really mean it. Every election vote Reform and never vote Conservative or Labour. Revenge is best served cold. Kick out the appeasers, the Lords.
1341828419982684161 2020-12-24 03:29:59 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I suppose Number 10 will be a hive of industry. Getting Editors of friendly papers on board so that they can give great support. If it was a true Brexit he would be shouting from the rooftops. Are they trying to make a silk purse from a sows ear? I seriously hope not.

1341770376058187777 2020-12-23 23:39:21 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @albertcurrie4 Albert, there is something going on I cannot understand. Most conspiracy theories appear, to me, to have greater sense than the ‘truth’ we have daily from the combined media and press. Same headlines, same fears, everything has little hope but the Vaccination!  “The Holy Grail”.
1341737320513482757 2020-12-23 21:28:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Tony Blair in charge of the Vaccination roll out??? I suppose he will have Alistair Campbell as his Chief of Staff and an office of toadies. I do not want this prick in charge of the pricks thank you.
1341734386677538816 2020-12-23 21:16:20 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The NHS is NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE? After all the billions put into it, it cannot help sick people with serious conditions whilst we have a pandemic. There is need for a quick root and branch reform. Contingency planning a disaster, too many cooks, Urgent streamlining required .
1341729050218393601 2020-12-23 20:55:08 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bear44willis It certainly looks like it Andrew.
1341722432579788800 2020-12-23 20:28:50 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The news that our Prime Minister is constantly phoning the German President of the EU is rather demeaning. IT is shaping up as a possible deal at any price. That price largely paid by our fishing industry. @BorisJohnson is transforming  into a combination of Chamberlain and Heath
1341714167837974528 2020-12-23 19:56:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @kelvmackenzie This is a common sense proposal. But @BorisJohnson will still be calling them “Friends and colleagues”. But please refer to any speech in which Sir Winston Churchill used such soppy language constantly.

1341708542278025222 2020-12-23 19:33:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> IT IS disgraceful that I can get a fairer representation of news in the U.K. &amp; the World from foreign news programmes than the biased anti UK stations on home soil. The Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport select Committee need to urgently enquire into the state of UK news reporting.

But, wait a Minute, didn’t the Labour Party, Lib Dem Party and The Conservative Party promise a restructure of the House of Lords. Politicians Lie Is the irrefutable truth. As for The Reform Party, I think it is being reformed.
1341664620591898625 2020-12-23 16:39:07 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @billarcher Bill, Second homes should not be allowed. In Devon and Cornwall and I suspect in many places, local people cannot afford to buy properties in their home towns and villages. With the acute shortage of housing it is time that 2nd/3rd  Homes should be seized by local Authorities.
1341659376738840577 2020-12-23 16:18:16 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I do find the announcement of MORE appointments of new Lords.The House of Lords is an over populated building and why should more public money be wasted? Boris has proved he is very good at spending tax payers money. We will be broke shortly.
1341658567498194945 2020-12-23 16:15:03 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @kelvmackenzie Balding should be dropped. As should Lineker. Bill Bailey should present it with Alex Scott. Enough. When you consider that the BBC hardly presents much sport, Wimbledon excepted, this is a programme best hosted by SKY and BT.

Like he never mentions Muslim/ Islam/ terrorism. @BorisJohnson For goodness sake call it for what it is.

1341340166783442952 2020-12-22 19:09:51 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Duggery4 Yes I do agree with Starmer, The Labour Party does need strong and decisive leadership, they certainly are not getting it from him. IF he were to be PM He will be just another Establishment man doing what the Establishment want. We need a revolution where new parties take over.
1341338702598074369 2020-12-22 19:04:02 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> HAVE @TiceRichard and @Nigel_Farage got their act in order. They must make an immediate intervention. The PM has effectively closed down Democracy to impose an almost total lockdown and to announce a very flawed deal with the EU kicking our fishing industry yet again.
1341337136625278978 2020-12-22 18:57:48 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Most days @KeyserSosse records the deaths on the day of Brave young men &amp; women of our Magnificent armed Services, accounts of soldiers blown up by awful IED Bombs. Sent out on foot or vehicle patrol knowing of the great dangers they face with every step. Such courage. FOR WHAT?
1341328620208463872 2020-12-22 18:23:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> IS Boris about to join a long list of Prime Ministers who have bowed to the EU. Heath, Wilson, Callaghan, Thatcher (sadly), Major, Blair, Brown, Cameron and May. Their photographs should be thrown out of Number Ten into a skip brought in to clear out NO.10. With Boris on top.
1341325907999547393 2020-12-22 18:13:11 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @KeyserSosse R.I.P. Tommy. A brave young man serving Queen and Country in the The Parachute Regiment. Killed by an insidious IED Bomb blast whilst Tommy was on foot patrol on this day in 2009 at Helmand Province, Afghanistan. WHY so many sent to their deaths in this Hell on Earth? Enquiry ?
1341323591514730498 2020-12-22 18:03:59 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Rob_Kimbell I think it is coming.
1341314764614602752 2020-12-22 17:28:54 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @KeyserSosse @3112Mel R.I.P. Tom. A truly brave young man, serving Queen and Country with the Royal Marines and SBS. Killed whilst on a covert mission in Kabul, Afghanistan. I salute you Captain Tom.

1341310292362469378 2020-12-22 17:11:08 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @kelvmackenzie He WILL be gone in January.
1341307473127477248 2020-12-22 16:59:56 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> You would think @BorisJohnson would speak to the Nation before any deal is signed off and before Parliament is recalled to fully inform the people. The reasoning about his eleventh hour backdown on fishing And ANY agreement that ties us to the EU.
1341299007948251136 2020-12-22 16:26:18 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> So @BorisJohnson has backed down on fishing. The EU will still continue to fish far more than we can. Nothing about banning that Dutch super trawler. Nothing about payment of their catches. This could have been sorted many months ago. We have been played by the EU and our PM.
1341296938591924224 2020-12-22 16:18:04 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn @SpammyFritter That is what a diet of lettuce leaves leads to.
1341296568792715264 2020-12-22 16:16:36 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> A letter to the DT from a Cornish man  complaining of the loss of village life due to visitors and local people have been taken advantage of. Nothing like the advantage taken by Westminster in housing millions of aliens in The midlands and North of England. Redress @BorisJohnson  https://t.co/40XpIxrWHd

Like  you I was so impressed by the strength of character shown by Darren with his battle with the Electoral Commission. But recently he has joined ‘The BLOB’ those that cry, moan, hate @BorisJohnson for him trying to help people avoid the Virus.

1341046029920198657 2020-12-21 23:41:03 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn Lettuce be serious John. I cannot abide lettuce, much prefer dandelion leaves. Cauliflower, Asparagus, Mushrooms, carrots and any veg other than Lettuce.
1341034846710358016 2020-12-21 22:56:37 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Conservative MP’s should demand, by signing a letter a urgent recall to Parliament to discuss this lockdown. Conservative AM’s in Wales should follow suit &amp; call for a No Confidence debate in Mark Drakeford. It is time LOCAL Conservatives stood up for their constituents.
1341023442167091200 2020-12-21 22:11:18 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Jacob Rees Mogg said that Members of Parliament are ESSENTIAL WORKERS and have a duty to attend Parliament in person to represent their Constituencies. Therefore we should all contact our MP’s and DEMAND they return to Parliament and call for an Urgent debate On the Lockdown.

1340959474090209280 2020-12-21 17:57:07 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson Concerned about Matt Hancock. Three times recently he has broken down. He could be heading towards a breakdown. I believe you should move him to another department to help him regain his strength. Replace him with a compassionate woman. Bring back Andrea Leadsom.
1340952810372915200 2020-12-21 17:30:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Hamilton relies on the brilliance of the whole team. He does not fix the car, decides on which tyres if &amp; when to change them. The pit team, the highly trained mechanics and computer whizzes SO MANY new innovations. Hamilton &amp; Co. Should truly have been in the Sports team award?
1340947665383731201 2020-12-21 17:10:11 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GiannaMarriotta @BorisJohnson Truth? What are you on about. Insulting people is your game. Go away.
1340943450963910656 2020-12-21 16:53:26 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Stuart Broad was the only TRUE sports personality. A man who has given so much to English County and Test Cricket. An incredible bowler and a very good batsman as well. Well spoken Son of a former English Test Cricketer. Well liked by friend and foe. A gentle Englishman.
1340941494375636993 2020-12-21 16:45:40 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GiannaMarriotta @BorisJohnson I never TELL anyone. Tis a suggestion. If you ignore it so be it but it does suggest you need help.

Killed by the insidious IED Bomb whilst assessing an earlier IED Blast. Again in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.  WHY were so many men and women allowed to be killed?
1340933586367725568 2020-12-21 16:14:14 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @IoanAnthony I have not suggested what you say I am. I find your statistics interesting and further proof of the necessity of wearing a mask outside ones Home. I have sent your mail to my voice coach.

1340925103895420928 2020-12-21 15:40:32 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> How many people are not wearing masks? Keeping their distance? WE spread this pandemic. NOT the Government. I despair. It is time that we each look at ourselves and not take individual decisions which could adversely affect others.
1340922507713503234 2020-12-21 15:30:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MichaelHollist3 Are you a Scientist? Where is this interesting page from? Actually it is meaningless and adds nothing whatsoever to the present situation.
1340921528104472576 2020-12-21 15:26:20 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> WHERE is The Stiff Upper Lip ? has it now been replaced by The Blame Culture. Pointing the finger, Someone to hate. This can only end badly. When some nutcase will try to physically harm @BorisJohnson. The vast majority understand AND support the need for the lockdown. CALM DOWN.
1340919718472015873 2020-12-21 15:19:08 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I appreciate the difficulties ending the provisions of jail for non payment of the BBC Licence tax. It would result in Bailiffs knocking on doors which would create more anger.The answer @BorisJohnson is to ABOLISH the licence &amp; direct the BBC to create  a subscription service.
1340916829154369538 2020-12-21 15:07:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> A woman breaks down on Nick Ferrari on LBC. The newspapers are FULL of negativity. The measures have, without doubt, affected all families in different ways family members barred on Christmas Day is extremely upsetting. But, come on, the pandemic is spread by US not BORIS!

But I am amazed how  Normally sane people are blaming Boris for TRYING to keep us safe. Perhaps Mr Neil would tell us what HE would do?

Bill Bailey started Christmas well for us. We have seen him live and I truly recommend him. A great entertainer. Take care.
1340578217095258112 2020-12-20 16:42:08 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn Both of them, brilliant. I am, I think I have said before, a great fan of Bill Bailey. Naturally funny but I do not think there is an instrument he cannot play. Underused by the TV Companies because he is an entertainer not a ‘Stand Up’. And he does not do politics.
1340577217538109440 2020-12-20 16:38:10 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @TimMadigan9 Yes, stop ALL Movement. Total lockdown for two years.

1340565366477602816 2020-12-20 15:51:04 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @billarcher When you consider how difficult it has been to discover names etc of rapists, the way they are released after a contemptuous short time of their sentence, allowed to return to the scenes of their crimes. We need a Armed Services coup against weak politicians.
1340564440811450368 2020-12-20 15:47:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ricskinner Ronald, could you be a little more explicit?

1340562782325002240 2020-12-20 15:40:48 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Seriously concerned. Did Boris make the decision cancelling Christmas prior to sending his MP’s home? Will he now agree a Brexit trade deal which will keep us entwined with the EU and therefore a BRINO? With MP’s unable to attend Westminster to check the details carefully?

1340409630682472448 2020-12-20 05:32:14 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Katieleighxox WHY? For protecting us? Do you have any evidence he and his scientists are incorrect? I mean scientific evidence? I certainly moan about him over BREXIT, but, tell me, what should he have done?

1340391216559603720 2020-12-20 04:19:03 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bbccomedy if anything highlights the state of comedy On the BBC (renowned for the total absence of any alleged comic supporting Brexit or @BorisJohnson. Left wingers all! ) BUT the brain dead decision to renew for FIVE YEARS ‘Mrs Browns Boys’ defies logic. Heads should roll.

A inhuman way to die, like far too many young men and women in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. WHAT WAS/is the point of foot patrols? An enquiry must discover WHY?

1339929081949925376 2020-12-18 21:42:42 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> It will be very interesting to see how many SENIOR officers, especially the Chief Constable will be sacked. The force being placed in special measures. If junior officers had done what has been done they would, undoubtably been sacked.  We shall see....moved to other top jobs?

1339869218716733440 2020-12-18 17:44:49 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @petemorristwit Just ask a colleague to check it then.
1339868655677521922 2020-12-18 17:42:35 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @paulkemp2121 Happy Birthday. Soon in one short year, you will enter the time of fruition. All dreams come true. You find yourself to be very attractive to the ladies. You will wonder why you never wanted to reach 60. Dreams come true this time next year!
1339862171757502464 2020-12-18 17:16:49 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> It appears that today’s replacement for Kay Burley is moulded in her style. This kind of interviewing is so old hat and just antagonises viewers. Stephen Dixon/Gillian Joseph are the two who get the best from interviewees.

But you will allow that Dutch Super Trawler to continue netting millions of fish, daily? Will Boris ban them and also ban fishing on Dogger Bank. We need to replenish fish stocks. That was one of the reasons Boris said we must control our seas.

This show of force, that is what it is, should be a warning. But whilst Parliament sits hundreds of miles away nobody notices, nobody cares. Until the blue paper is lit.
1339842526883291137 2020-12-18 15:58:46 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @carjengland @BorisJohnson Caroline. It will give time, necessary time, for the fish stocks to replenish. Do you really want that Dutch super trawler as large as a football pitch netting massive catches ?
1339837593480007681 2020-12-18 15:39:09 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Debbi_W_artist Exactly.
1339829140627832833 2020-12-18 15:05:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson  Have you warned the Dutch that we will ban the use of their super trawler which is netting massive catches. If it continues from 1.1.21 It will be impounded, the catch confiscated and the owners fined punitive damages. Or said nothing to “friends and partners”?
1339827671455428608 2020-12-18 14:59:44 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @LordBarnbrook In short, Micheal, Yes.
1339827384799866880 2020-12-18 14:58:35 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Can you believe that @BorisJohnson has proposed the EU can continue to fish as normal for three years. They want ten and it is thought the UK could offer SEVEN years. WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT FIRM PROMISE? Do not kick the Fishing Industry NOW. Unbelievable.
1339826199749652481 2020-12-18 14:53:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Can anyone tell me WHY? What has this individual done for this Country?  https://t.co/t4dkcze2iO
1339825338512191488 2020-12-18 14:50:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Calls for Tobias Ellwood MP to be fined for breaching the Covid Regs. He should be fined AS MUST the @SKY Hypocrites Kay Burley and Beth Rigby. The lack of any action by Police, or condemnation from the Government suggests fines are just for we little people?

But no he boots the ball back to Henderson whilst Sheffield had players close to the keeper.

1339616772169850884 2020-12-18 01:01:42 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I cannot be alone in finding the boring, inane ‘helpful not’ comments of the awful left wing (of course) Arthur Smith in  BBC’s ‘Money for Nothing’  This treating of older viewers with Blue Peter type commentary is totally Insulting. Sarah Moore’s programme is ruined by Smith.

1339488138041974784 2020-12-17 16:30:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Consider Gordon Brown’s direction for police to ignore the young girls, successive Home Secretaries, Prime Ministers, police Chief Constables, Detective Chiefs, local Authorities, The report mentions nothing. This is why it is a WHITEWASH, @pritipatelmp Do white lives NOT matter?
1339485594276294656 2020-12-17 16:20:26 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn Back to dreaming John!  Fingers crossed.
1339484751590207489 2020-12-17 16:17:05 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Henry33395719 Spot on Henry.
1339468196349394944 2020-12-17 15:11:18 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GowTolson Congratulations Micheal. I wish you and your wife a Happy Anniversary.
1339467362173632513 2020-12-17 15:07:59 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @tomhunt1988  FYI
1339467140563386368 2020-12-17 15:07:07 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Rape gangs whitewash. The Petitions Committee have a debate on Monday 18 January 2021 at 4.30pm in Westminster Hall. Tom Hunt MP, will open. The Home Office will send a Minister. NOTE not PritiPatel! Please send YOUR comments and observations to tom.hunt.mp@parliament.U.K.
1339465295585570817 2020-12-17 14:59:47 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @johns00000 Suggestion. Cut ALL BBC salaries by 50%. That would provide quite a sum. Also ban first class, Business etc Travel. Perks which normal public service workers do not receive.
1339462520185249792 2020-12-17 14:48:45 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Perhaps when the Rape GangsWhitewash is debated in Parliament the Home Secretary could be asked by an MP WHY Maggie Oliver that remarkable former WPC who resigned because her senior officers would not Act against the rape gangs and has great knowledge was not part of the ERG?

1339460643032862720 2020-12-17 14:41:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Child Rape Gangs. Members: Labour MP  Sarah Champion, Conservative MP Imran Ahmad Khan, survivor and campaigner Sammy Woodhouse, Simon Bailey, Police Chief. NO MAGGIE OLIVER! Who are the “Independent experts on child sexual exploitation” names please.@pritipatelmp   Whitewash.
1339458873460219905 2020-12-17 14:34:16 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> W H I T E W A S H! @pritipatelmp paper on CHILD Rape Gangs. “Some studies have indicated an over-representation of Asian and Black offenders. However, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the ethnicity of offenders as existing research is limited and data collection is poor”
1339457099202490369 2020-12-17 14:27:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @rising_serpent @KulTamaraJensen Did you ever think that we BRITS could be ordered around, meekly accepting lockdowns, pubs, cinemas, restaurants, swimming pools, health centres, barbers hairdressers etc CLOSED by dictac?  Businesses bankrupted, jobs lost?? So we have sleepwalked into total subservience.
1339455787744301058 2020-12-17 14:22:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @PatrioticSocia1 Word has it...He didn’t......
1339455501210427397 2020-12-17 14:20:52 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @mosiestearn Maureen,  why not have historical dramas of medieval  Britain with all Black or Asian actors? Why not have all Television announcers, newsreaders (that is what they do..paid for reading from an autocue) from the Black community?
1339453175003291654 2020-12-17 14:11:37 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @charlottemilne0 I agree Charlotte. She has brought great discredit to @SKY alongwith the equally vile and hypocritical Burley and Boulton, who should have been sacked for bullying, @SkyNews is sick. That none have been sacked proves that. Sam Coates is another heading for a fall.
1339451918037495809 2020-12-17 14:06:37 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Reading yesterday that MAY cancelled the planes that spotted illegal fishing in OUR waters. What other decisions by this incompetent anti British PM will be revealed. She was a disaster. WHY is she still an MP?
1339450859541946369 2020-12-17 14:02:25 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> You would think the Business Secretary would be questioning Vodafone. President Trump got American Companies who had set up HQ’s and production outside the USA to return. We need proactive Business Secretaries. Getting jobs for Brits.
1339299062252761088 2020-12-17 03:59:14 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn Great news John. Big smiles.  https://t.co/wOANYHEZnP

1339264023045484547 2020-12-17 01:40:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @WinstonChu1945 Thank you Winston. Welcome back.
1339263925054017536 2020-12-17 01:39:36 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @whosydnigel Thank you Nigel.
1339199350631751681 2020-12-16 21:23:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> In view of the Coroners decision that AIR POLLUTION contributed to the death of 9 year old Ella Kissi-Debrah. A lovely black girl. There must be urgent enquiries on housing &amp; schools on or being built next to Busy roads, The danger for our children must be tackled. No slacking.
1339128815927308288 2020-12-16 16:42:44 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Biden must never be given a Royal Visit. Treated as badly as we treated President Trump.
1339128536943235072 2020-12-16 16:41:37 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The problem here is that Southern based MP’s DO NOT see this. If they had to see this day in day out in our Northern Towns and Cities they may PINDER of what they have done. No attempt to join in with the White Community, to enjoy our traditions. MP’s should visit the North.
1339122666079477764 2020-12-16 16:18:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @TimMadigan9 So do I😂😂😂
1339121953307832320 2020-12-16 16:15:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GowTolson We too Micheal. Merry Christmas.
1339121530333179905 2020-12-16 16:13:47 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> As the old men and women carry on in America. WHY don’t representatives of both houses have a COMPULSORY retirement age, or like Presidents, only allowed two terms. They are holding up younger, more progressive, dynamic people. There is no such thing as an indispensable person.
1339119302562222082 2020-12-16 16:04:56 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn Good luck to your wife. You too. Keep positive for her matey.
1339108771503755265 2020-12-16 15:23:05 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Probably the best option, but the mood music is changing and I am concerned. Talk about a hurried treaty to be Rushed through Parliament, suggests to me that he has agreed to changes to his negotiating stance we may not appreciate or support.
1339107985335922688 2020-12-16 15:19:57 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Hope you have a peaceful Christmas.  Let us pray that as we enter 2021 those that govern us will be more responsive to us, less inclined to rely totally on Scientists, rid themselves of the hundreds of advisers AND Get CamperVans and follow YOUR glorious example. Simples
1339104970063417347 2020-12-16 15:07:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The noise about a possible deal with a truncated Westminster fudge. In the manner of Maastricht, Lisbon Has @BorisJohnson  decided to follow the disastrous path of others. To hide parts of a deal we may find unpalatable? A course of action for which he could pay a heavy price.
1339102428038385666 2020-12-16 14:57:52 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Letter to the DT made me chuckle.  https://t.co/WqTZkW4i0P
1338951793146023937 2020-12-16 04:59:18 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @geoffreyMyers1 @MailOnline I read this. If I did not have respect for Andrew Neil I would say I found it full of supposition and half truths. Indeed I wondered if this could be written by a New A Neil?  Still it takes all sorts and perhaps the early stages of depression. One I will ignore, completely.

1338373753701535744 2020-12-14 14:42:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @billarcher It is right that he has done so much as you highlight. BUT I have had enough of Politicians preaching to us. I do not want a future King to do the same. The Queen is highly respected for the way she has conducted herself.
1338372408475066368 2020-12-14 14:37:02 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson Surely the activity of that awful Dutch super trawler MUST be stopped today. You should flex your muscles and remind the Dutch IF they wish to fish our waters. They will never be allowed to use that trawler in our waters. STOP NOW.
1338371605714657281 2020-12-14 14:33:51 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Well said.
1338371464181985280 2020-12-14 14:33:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Am I the only one of the view that Prince Charles should step aside for William and Kate. He cannot erase the fact that he &amp; the Duchess of Cornwall will always be remembered for Diana’s remark “There were three of us in the marriage”. William is not tainted. A fresh approach.
1338369790755418112 2020-12-14 14:26:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> With Princess Beatrice ignoring the COVID regulations it is time the Establishment figures are fined and humiliated.OR @BorisJohnson IT looks like one law for them and one for us. They need stamping on. The Queen must bring her in for a dressing down at the very least.
1338362975321776132 2020-12-14 13:59:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ANDIBABY8 Surely such action, which is unlawful, is insurrection. We could call in the Military to arrest ALL the SNP Cabinet. Now wouldn’t that be absolutely wonderful.
1338360951901483009 2020-12-14 13:51:31 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I do know that the great Barry Took has passed. But that is my point about @BBC comedy. It is dead, deceased, lifeless and certainly in no way funny.
1338359269914193922 2020-12-14 13:44:50 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn Wish Mrs Spinnerjohn well John.
1338358911741681666 2020-12-14 13:43:24 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Perhaps the @BBC Chairman and Director General (surely these two roles could be combined into one job?) should ask Barry Took to help them sort out BBC Comedy.  The Commissioning Editor and team should be removed and a new team &amp; Editor appointed FROM OUTSIDE the BBC.
1338357073361375232 2020-12-14 13:36:06 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @DamotwoT Good luck. Hope it works out for you.
1338356780762587137 2020-12-14 13:34:56 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Watching the Ed Milliband interview yesterday. It was a pantomime act  highlighting why Labour are unelectable, then consider Lisa Nandy’s quite amazing Interview days  before in which it was a Deal at any price White Flag approach. How can anyone trust this lot to run anything?
1338355542025252864 2020-12-14 13:30:01 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SKY Burley is, allegedly, getting ‘friends’ at SKY to find out who are the whistleblowers on her breaking of COVID Regulations. IF, as alleged, Burley was boasting about her intention to breach the regulations, that comes into the realms of a Conspiracy? Far more serious surely!
1338195734118756352 2020-12-14 02:55:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @61Geordie Excellent suggestion Geordie, I will suggest it to Mackerel / sorry Macron.

1338111546929590276 2020-12-13 21:20:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @DavidBlakeman13 If that was the case I would applaud but I will not hold my breath.
1338109281963548672 2020-12-13 21:11:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Neatly put.
1338109051939459072 2020-12-13 21:10:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson  YOU are a man of straw. A modern Chamberlain being played by Merkel and Co. For goodness sake get a backbone, phone the EU and call the talks off now.
1338108388052492288 2020-12-13 21:07:55 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @RuleBrexitannia Did we really expect anything from him?
1338105522407563266 2020-12-13 20:56:31 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @AdrianCroome I am of that view. It turns out he is weak.
1338104447269015552 2020-12-13 20:52:15 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Excellent.
1338104142406021122 2020-12-13 20:51:02 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @DavidBlakeman13 David, it would be nice to think that. I believe it was the opposite scenario. I am now convinced he WILL get a deal Which will tie us to the EU . He is more concerned about Remainers than the majority.
1338102629466054656 2020-12-13 20:45:02 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson THIS is a bloody farce. the time was right to say we have reached the end of the road, the UK will not take any more of this charade. You have insulted the UK for the last time. Goodbye. Boris , I thought you were a lion, more like a pussy
1338078690962526212 2020-12-13 19:09:54 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @IAmBulldog74 Take care. Much rest, much liquid, much food, much tender loving care and understanding of your very serious ailment. DO NOT overdo it or you may find yourself in hospital alongside COVID-19 patients.
1338056203952328704 2020-12-13 17:40:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The red wall was helped the other day by the ridiculous Lisa Tandy, today the end of Labour UpT’North was helped by the hysterical Ed Milliband. Ignored the Referendum, the General election last year, the 80 majority in the HofC. No it IS the Brexiteers in Parliament. BUFFOON.
1338046114336018432 2020-12-13 17:00:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BigAlMercury I think the time has come to close down the Lords and close it down. Start afresh with an upper chamber of 200 people nominated by local  people.  NOT OAP former politicians

But their leaders are generally anti UK. By giving in to the EU and having Customs checks in Belfast. We are hastening the drive for a United Ireland.

1337821171673411590 2020-12-13 02:06:37 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Lord Patten failed MP. His mate, Major gave him the governor of Hong Kong to deal with the handover then given by MAJOR , A job as a Commissioner on the EU gravy train. He is in receipt of  a large pension and has to speak up for them. So we ignore this bloated Lord.

1337792177599090691 2020-12-13 00:11:24 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @truemagic68 I agree but if the suggestion, in the Express, the PM wants to pay UK fishermen so to allow French fishermen to continue fishing in our waters. Such an action, now, would be the open door for Nigel Farage and, if approved, The Reform Party. I doubt Boris could survive such a move

1337757922114363393 2020-12-12 21:55:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @KeyserSosse R.I.P. Steven ‘Jamie’ Fellows Serving Queen and Country in The Royal Marines. Slaughtered by a bomb (IED) on vehicle patrol Helman River Wadi, Afghanistan. Jamie I salute you.  WHY were we there?
1337756261295808517 2020-12-12 21:48:41 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @KeyserSosse R.I.P. Marc, Damian and John . Brave men serving The Queen and Country in The Royal Marines. Murdered by a suicide bomber in hell on earth. Helmand Province, Afghanistan. I salute each of you.  WHY were we there?  One dat the truth will be revealed.
1337742341826899968 2020-12-12 20:53:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn John, If your wife has had an endoscopy before she will know the drill. If not just  tell her to relax. She can have sedation.
1337704582449868808 2020-12-12 18:23:20 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> ANY British company NOT prepared for 1.1.21 for NO DEAL is, frankly, a disgrace. FOUR YEARS they have had to prepare, test their plans and have oven ready plans for both A Deal or No Deal scenarios. The complaining companies need to rid themselves of their woeful management.
1337698406333100032 2020-12-12 17:58:47 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @WendyPuerto Thank you.
1337697042680975360 2020-12-12 17:53:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @WendyPuerto . Wendy did you get my tweet. It appears that I cannot retweet now. Did you discover why?
1337696687758991361 2020-12-12 17:51:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> We will remember.
1337696588890845185 2020-12-12 17:51:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @oflynnsocial Mr Ellwood. I thought on some of your interviews, over the months on television, that you were heading for a mental breakdown. This, I fear is yet greater evidence that you MUST seek help. The whip should be withdrawn from this, now, rogue MP. He needs help.
1337688334907404288 2020-12-12 17:18:46 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BaqueHime @SileER Such people should be treated as Traitors. Charged and if found guilty all their assets taken into public control.
1337687727031115776 2020-12-12 17:16:21 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> To be fair, WHY is Assange being detained in Belmarsh? This is a stain on Britain. Why cannot he be bailed. We hold his passport etc. Treat him with respect. This is awful.
1337686074882134018 2020-12-12 17:09:47 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I wish this new party every success.
1337685538036387841 2020-12-12 17:07:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SkyNews correspondent in Belgium...”The UK HURTLING towards no deal”. Who the hell in Editorial allowed such ridiculous language. This is the Burley speak I hoped would be eliminated. One hoped that @Sky had learned their lesson. But no THEY are HURTLING out of this home.
1337672497903366144 2020-12-12 16:15:50 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Quite brilliant editing. HOW can @SKY keep these two in employment?
1337671565320839168 2020-12-12 16:12:08 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Does this gentleman, in his letter to the DT, speak for many? I doubt it. But I praise the DT for printing it. It is right that ALL opinions be aired.  https://t.co/iTzZZ0N343
1337668151027388416 2020-12-12 15:58:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I have to admit that I watched @SkyNews yesterday and Thursday to see how they filled the Burley programme. I was delighted to find that Stephen Dixon, the nicest, politest presenter at SKY was in charge. His interview yesterday with Oliver Dowden was excellent.
1337666311602778112 2020-12-12 15:51:15 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bruce_bwkm  I was being honest yesterday suggesting you join a Hospital Radio Group. You have a quick wit, like music, can chat as long as you have a mug of coffee. Join up and cheer the patients.
1337665890675019776 2020-12-12 15:49:35 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The BBC is an obvious public body in URGENT need for a root and branch spring clean. It is still in an Establishment, untouchable, world of their own. @BorisJohnson Should constitute a Committee of people from OUTSIDE broadcasting, yes US the viewers/listeners,  to create change.
1337664550741684224 2020-12-12 15:44:16 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I am heartily sick of the CBI constantly waving the EU flag and since the Referendum have done absolutely nothing to ensure their members are prepared for A deal or No Deal. This organisation, which receives monies from the EU  need to remove the word BRITISH from its title.
1337663910250487808 2020-12-12 15:41:43 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bruce_bwkm @kvnbhrly1 I agree Bruce. Notice Tis the BBC. Who are in full Remainer mode hoping for Boris to sell us down the river.
1337663574345314306 2020-12-12 15:40:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> DM critical on people who took a gamble to supply urgently needed Masks, ventilators, etc for the Chinese Pandemic. They made fortunes. I say WELL DONE &amp; THANK YOU. What about the incompetence of the old Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt NOT ensuring we had stocks for ANY health event
1337660956760018945 2020-12-12 15:29:59 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @cwsmith1 You must take your place in the queue. The NHS can never be brought into the 21st Century whilst we constantly praise them, whilst scandals like Shrewsbury, Staffordshire etc are swept under the carpet. Another public body in need of root and branch reorganisation!
1337659059823140865 2020-12-12 15:22:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> It appears to me that the Home Office needs a root and branch removal of Civil Servants. A further allegation of bullying by a Minister leads me to that conclusion.  Civil Servants appear to have declared war on their political masters. So a complete Spring Cleaning is essential.

1337511983550238723 2020-12-12 05:38:01 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> BUY BRITISH.
1337511521652518918 2020-12-12 05:36:11 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Can we be assured that we have not and will not pay the £60billion allegedly promised by May.
1337511305436164098 2020-12-12 05:35:19 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Macron &amp; Merkel REFUSED to talk to our Prime Minister on the telephone. They will come crawling back asking to allow their cars etc into the UK, To fish in our waters, for us to buy their produce. We must bring back all our troops and hardware from ALL parts of the EU.
1337508358979538947 2020-12-12 05:23:37 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BrexitHome He will lose to Le Penn  will pull France out of the EU and form a relationship with the UK. The EU will lose, Italy, Poland and Hungary next year.
1337507051430440960 2020-12-12 05:18:25 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I think once we drag these trawlers into our ports and confiscate their catch then fine the owners an enormous amount or we keep the boat. That might be a help.
1337503004212289539 2020-12-12 05:02:20 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bigstrongmo They believe Biden will end the ‘Special relationship’ and bring riches to the EU. Ireland believes that Biden will (try) to force us back into the EU. They think we will be alone. They believe we will be on our knees. Boris must pull up the drawbridge.

1337491128657080322 2020-12-12 04:15:09 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @WendyPuerto  when they stopped you retweeting. What was their reasoning and how long where you on the naughty step?
1337488702608732172 2020-12-12 04:05:30 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @DaveAtherton20 It is having a succession of mediocre Prime Ministers after one towering politician, Margaret Thatcher. Major the deceiver, Blair the warmonger, Brown the incompetent, Cameron the lightweight, May the Disaster, The jury is out on Boris. The UK has not sung as one since Thatcher.

They, like lapdogs to the Germans &amp; French,  kicked constantly the UK position. Now your wonderful Country and, mostly, lovely people are going to have to tighten your belts. They were stupid.
1337411315938320385 2020-12-11 22:58:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Debbi_W_artist Bring back journalism! Honest, fair, hard hitting, well researched. Journalists with reputable editors. ,m
1337404064997511169 2020-12-11 22:29:11 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I wrote yesterday, following the statement from SKY That I believed that was a sign they wanted Burley back. Although weakened, compromised and certainly unable to maintain her aggressive style (as with Rigby) The pair should be sacked.

1337400632119062529 2020-12-11 22:15:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Exactly. How has OFCOM allowed a foreign company to have a licence to browbeat us daily with lies.?

1337367727170842624 2020-12-11 20:04:47 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @corporal_frank Google it!
1337341335825764354 2020-12-11 18:19:55 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @canadiancarol1 @sky That is news beneficial to the UK Do not expect the Democratic Party USA owned SKY TV to mention that. Uncle Joe would not be happy. WHY did OFCOM allow this foreign owned TV Company to provide “skewed partial news” to the UK?   There has to be an enquiry.
1337339771761422337 2020-12-11 18:13:42 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bruce_bwkm I think you should consider offering your services to your local hospital radio service. “Bruce’s F’n Coffee Morning Show” music to recover from.
1337316029777711105 2020-12-11 16:39:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> We are very lucky in having two formidable female Secretaries of State doing an excellent job. @PennyMordaunt and @trussliz will pose an interesting battle for the top job when that time comes,sooner or later.
1337315049468268544 2020-12-11 16:35:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @PennyMordaunt was absolutely first class yesterday. Having to answer another, ridiculous anti Brexit, Urgent Q on the Negotiations. Labour ARE being Anti Brit. The law of the land IS we leave with a Deal or No Deal. Rachel Reeves with her Estuary lingo does her Party no favours.
1337311468623163393 2020-12-11 16:21:14 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> EU want EU boats access to UK fish stocks until Dec2021 or until a separate agreement has been reached.  “in order to guarantee the sustainability of fisheries and in light of the importance of fisheries for the economic livelihood of many communities”. DID THEY CARE FOR OURS?
1337289320764493827 2020-12-11 14:53:14 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Remainers are out in full The media are showing their full Support the EU (certainly not the UK) tired and predictable views.The Labour Party telling @BorisJohnson to resign for a failure in Statesmanship! (Do any of them show any kind of that quality?) Time to get behind the UK!
1337157060232929281 2020-12-11 06:07:40 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Sam Coates, saliva almost dripping from his lips, mad staring eyes talking as if Canada style/Australian Style NO DEAL had never been discussed. NO this was a Remainer rant from a Remainer News channel, noted for hypocrisy.  I want British newscasters to start backing BRITAIN.

1337093293524574209 2020-12-11 01:54:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Now we must all look forward. Get behind the Country. Be proud and just pray Boris and his ministers are up to the job.

1337090319175782401 2020-12-11 01:42:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson please deliver a barnstormer of a speech. Telling the EU they have wasted time and ended with A NO DEAL.  There will be No arrangement for EU Trawlers to fish in UK waters from 1st January 2021. Our free ports will attract the World. We invite Ireland to join us.
1337079285807521793 2020-12-11 00:58:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Remember the bullying behaviour of Adam Boulton  towards  Beth Rigby. No action taken whereas most male employees elsewhere would be disciplined AT LEAST. Then this and one must ask if SKY are just upset they were caught? Management?  https://t.co/rtrlWxcn1R
1337075099393007619 2020-12-11 00:42:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @abline11 Simple really @BorisJohnson replies quoting Macron and says THAT is what WE are doing. Defending OUR sovereignty! Against the Aggressive and disgraceful tactics of the EU. Whatever happens Great Britain will never forget nor forgive this episode.
1337003999241904128 2020-12-10 19:59:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Today @Skynews still showed #Burley and at the bottom KayBurley.... proof that they have no intention of Ridding themselves of the hypocrite. Also, more importantly, it was most unfair on Stephen Dixon HE ran the programme in his usual  well mannered way. No credit given to him.

1336946769570263042 2020-12-10 16:12:03 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Was @BorisJohnson aware of what @michealgovemp agreed? Working against everything Boris said and why he brought his Bill to the HofC. It was disingenuous of Gove to say it was in the Manifesto HE voted to change that to safeguard Ulster. I am sick of this duplicitous behaviour.

1336891024002732032 2020-12-10 12:30:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I must say that @BorisJohnson surprised me last evening. I genuinely thought he would do anything to get a deal. I apologise for doubting him. YET, yet, WHY wait till Sunday to draw a line. THEY expect the UK to buckle. Draw the line today. Get the Navy in the English Channel.

1336708541575524352 2020-12-10 00:25:25 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SkyNews Messrs Burley &amp; Rigby have badly weakened their positions for interviewing. The interviewee will easily turn the argument against them over this disgraceful breaking of the COVID-19 regulations. They have neutered themselves. Time for respectful, fairer correspondents.
1336705136895340548 2020-12-10 00:11:54 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @johnopen1 @BorisJohnson John. Careful, you will be suspect number 62,998,967.
1336606553147928580 2020-12-09 17:40:09 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @PonderousTomes @BorisJohnson Well I am not. It matters to our sovereignty it matters to a return to what was. You are, I presume a Remainer, a anti UK individual. As you dislike fish you must be a vegan. You come across as a sad individual. Cheer up go out and buy fish and chips.
1336600844591095808 2020-12-09 17:17:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I fear a @BorisJohnson climb down for his beloved deal. IF, as I fear, he gives the EU the rights for years to come to fish the UK waters, (they want 10 years). He will lose so much support and The Reform Party will be gearing up. But, Boris,  I hope and pray I am proved wrong.
1336599677257588736 2020-12-09 17:12:50 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bruce_bwkm Please play. “For those in trouble on the sea” on the way home. To prepare you for the day ahead.
1336596732587761664 2020-12-09 17:01:08 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> As @BorisJohnson flies ( in a Green flying machine?) to Brussels for Dinner with the head of the EC. Having sold Ulster down the Irish Sea. You can bet he will allow fishing by EU states to carry on.

1336590685936513026 2020-12-09 16:37:06 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn De Gea was poor, especially the 3rd goal. Scholes was right he chickened out.
1336589244706541570 2020-12-09 16:31:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn Well John. McTominey proved yet again the man who gives his all. Pity the others did not follow his example. I am afraid there are few ‘team’ players. Olly has much work to do. Bring in Roy Keen. The trainers are voiceless. Olly sits quietly, Carrick and the others hardly a peep.
1336577915698507776 2020-12-09 15:46:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Sky says NO Sky employees have been suspended over the Burley Party. WHY NOT? SKY operates head in sand believing it will all blow over. What are the Police doing? Blatant breaking of the regulations. Unforgivable. @pritipatelmp  https://t.co/mUcEUXeXDS

1336395447447982081 2020-12-09 03:41:18 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Gove has installed a customs post down the Irish Sea. He has lost the chance of ever becoming Prime Minister and has weakened the position of the Prime Minister when he enters the spiders den tomorrow. No doubt fishing rules will be relaxed and we will be tied to the EU FOR EVER.
1336393170750410755 2020-12-09 03:32:15 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @KeyserSosse Murdered. You mean decapitated a child. And a life term Minimum time to serve EIGHT BLOODY YEARS. Justice is sick. Not blind sick. Deportation Order? I give up. Who chooses the judges. I want to know the racial breakdown of Judges.

They cannot nor should not escape this penalty. The Home Secretary should also remind them that they have demanded people resign for far less than this party did.
1336370237067890690 2020-12-09 02:01:07 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Re Burley/Rigby are they getting a £10.000 fixed penalty ticket, along with all others who attended this party? They applied that penalty on Jeremy Corbyn’s brother and the lad who had a house party both got £10.000 fines. @pritipatelmp Get these two fined immediately.

1336215355266641922 2020-12-08 15:45:41 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Yesterday, Rachel Reeves MP On the EU Trade talks. “A failure of statesmanship” (Gosh how that must have hurt statesMANship) but her ridiculous estuary speak with the speech obviously written to deal with a NoDeal scenario. This was a failure in political nous. A real lightweight
1336071261768851463 2020-12-08 06:13:06 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Nigel Farage in an interview this morning on TalkRadio with JHB. Said he was convinced that Boris wants a deal and will betray the UK.  But going like a naughty schoolboy to the head mistress’s office is weakness. He had better be very careful or HE could be out by Christmas.
1336043107897454593 2020-12-08 04:21:14 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson has fallen for it. “Come into my parlour said the spider to the fly” He will get there &amp; probably face EC President Ursula von der Leyen , Merkel &amp; Macron.

1335492418179887104 2020-12-06 15:52:59 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn John, We are all in the same boat. This is very difficult for lots of people. But I do feel for the elderly on their own. I am 76 and lucky to have my wife, but it would be quite difficult on my own. Also one parent families living in tower blocks etc. That must be hell.
1335491235205836800 2020-12-06 15:48:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Frankly I find it laughable, at this late stage, to read ‘The cabinet back NO DEAL’  Really. I would have thought such an eventuality would have been a pre requisite to serving in the cabinet in the first place. Then cowardly  nameless cabinet ministers back no deal. It’s a farce

1335342070727368705 2020-12-06 05:55:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn Yes three great English blokes.
1335340728235356161 2020-12-06 05:50:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn I was only talking about the over supper. Saw them live.
1335340433334030339 2020-12-06 05:49:03 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn I think that reply will be transferred to great put downs. Thank you. I meant Cavanni.

1335337503323254784 2020-12-06 05:37:24 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @truemagic68 The Invitation from Middlesex Cricket Club is in the post. They need a keeper with a Godfrey Evans physique, a good eye for detail (who could not agree that your forensic scouring of the financial papers is such) and the ability to hold a catch. The job, Dear David, is yours.
1335335817808646159 2020-12-06 05:30:42 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Sadly obvious that @BorisJohnson is no negotiator. We will be told some nonsense that he was very tough with the EU. He should have closed the talks forthwith and announced A NO DEAL.
1335335301267513354 2020-12-06 05:28:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The EU demanded that the talks continue. Of course they would, believing @BorisJohnson is so DESPERATE for a trade deal he will bend. How else can his agreement to carry on talking when the blocks to a deal are all on our side. IF he bends he is toast. He will have lied to us all
1335221851581280257 2020-12-05 21:57:51 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @NelsonChurchil3 I agree Nelson.
1335217398866178051 2020-12-05 21:40:09 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> WELL DONE Farmer Price Who cleared the  River Lugg of debris. houses were flooded last Feb: ) 14! Officials from Environmental Agency The Wildlife Trust,Forestry Commission, Police, Herefordshire Council. @BorisJohnson  YOU must say people’s homes MUST BE PROTECTED FROM FLOODING.
1335199147083915265 2020-12-05 20:27:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SeanAKehoe Please write to the Home Secretary to outlaw dual passport holders. Then find Annie and send her packing to her beloved Ireland. Why should we put up with people that hate this Country?
1335198543515164672 2020-12-05 20:25:14 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @petemorristwit My body clock has never let me down.
1335120164917043200 2020-12-05 15:13:47 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Whilst Barnier is the negotiator. He is answerable to the leaders of the EU and, it transpires, Macron and Merkel. He, I believe,  has ambitions to lead the EU and so his contribution in these trade talks must be to tie the UK to EU requirements. NO DEAL is the best deal.
1335118679734882304 2020-12-05 15:07:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @truemagic68 @mdbuckley Blair/Brown Oh happy days - who will ever forget 🎶🎶Things can only get better🎶🎶. They didn’t! Afghanistan / Iraq. Dodgy Dossier.
1334986736506707969 2020-12-05 06:23:35 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The EU want a 10 year agreement on fishing. No doubt along the lines of the quotas they fish now. So Boris is speaking tomorrow with Von der Layen.  If he drops his guard and allows anything which is NOT what  HE  Promised. He is toast. NO DEAL is better than a BAD DEAL.

1334900577311072257 2020-12-05 00:41:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Come on Welsh pubs, restaurants,hotels etc. Mark Drakeford the hopeless 4th rate politicians running Wales like a Dickensian Beagle in charge of the Workhouse. 100 pubs have barred him from ever using their premises. Lets have a All Wales ban. Is this the end of Labour in Wales?
1334841432247562243 2020-12-04 20:46:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @KeyserSosse Horrifying. Simply horrifying. Fair trial?
1334840440902782976 2020-12-04 20:42:15 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> So many people here do not read at all. Boris advised the UN that HE was committed to the Charter on Migrants. Directly to the UN. That is as good as a signature.
1334839398110801920 2020-12-04 20:38:07 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @OuseMoor @BorisJohnson He signed it THREE weeks ago.
1334838751554641922 2020-12-04 20:35:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @jfdta @BorisJohnson So did Boris three weeks ago.
1334838604389027841 2020-12-04 20:34:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @JohnTay20995736 @BorisJohnson He gave his agreement TWO WEEKS ago to extend it.  I realise you are one of the dwindling number of people who think the sun shines from his posterior. But before you criticise best get your facts right.
1334818968993996802 2020-12-04 19:16:56 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Will @borisjohnson please explain when he will be returning the illegal migrants to wherever they came from ? Also as he has signed the UN Migrants charter without ANY authority from WE the people. Will he arrange a referendum on immigration.
1334799870578880512 2020-12-04 18:01:03 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Talk today of a reshuffle. From the latest ConHome survey Boris, Jenrick, Hancock,Williamson, Alister Jack, Micheal Gove, Brandon Lewis plus a few more could be moved on. Liz Truss a very hard working minister rightly tops the poll.  https://t.co/gFVx3Coojb

1334766185590759425 2020-12-04 15:47:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> As we wait and read of the duplicity displayed by the EU. WHY are we still talking? Time to end this charade now. Legal texts, quotas for fish, demands to keep us locked into the ECHR and the EU. THEY just do not accept it. @BorisJohnson show LEADERSHIPclose down the talks today.
1334764945473478657 2020-12-04 15:42:16 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @KeyserSosse R.I.P. Jack. A proud young man,serving Queen and Country in the Honourable Artillery Company killed whilst on vehicle patrol By a roadside bomb. In Hell on earth, Helmand Province, Afghanistan. One day someone will write of the utter waste of good young men and women. For what?
1334763446957641728 2020-12-04 15:36:19 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson would you request your Law Officers to review the sentence given to the yob who climbed onto the Cenotaph and tried to burn our Union Flag, during the Black Lives Matter disturbance. Judge Christopher Hehir at Southwark Crown Court? Do our War Dead mean nothing?
1334740730376581120 2020-12-04 14:06:03 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SeanAKehoe Good morning Sean, how is the President Elect today?

1334738819455840259 2020-12-04 13:58:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> What Boris up to now?  (Actually Actor Marek Larwood in I want my hat back.)  https://t.co/Y7BqgG6lqB
1334736159256301568 2020-12-04 13:47:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @DevonshireDanUK Devolution is hopeless. But @BorisJohnson loves it because he does not have to make decisions.
1334735143408459776 2020-12-04 13:43:51 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> WHO APPOINTS THESE PEOPLE TO BE JUDGES. Remember that yob who claimed onto the Cenotaph and tried to set fire to The Union Jack. He appeared yesterday at Southwark Crown Court and got A TWO YEAR CONDITIONAL DISCHARGE. Now consider the words of the Judge Christopher Hehir.  https://t.co/hEU6DoRax0
1334495827285467137 2020-12-03 21:52:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Stephen90182822 Yes, or start a reply with “Now”, or “Well” &amp; “you know” scattered throughout the answer (or even the question)
1334447255831638016 2020-12-03 18:39:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn I read that Aston Villa have placed a £100m price on Grealish.  Woodward could have bought him for £50m. How many times has this happened to the man running the club?
1334442313347690498 2020-12-03 18:20:14 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn  Olly was really poor last night! Do you agree?
1334441383105585153 2020-12-03 18:16:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bruce_bwkm THAT is the Question!  OR in the case of Peston it could be a rhetorical question, me thinks.
1334440610082811905 2020-12-03 18:13:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Is this week all the agonising wait, since the 2016 Referendum on Membership of the EU, are brought to an end? With A) A deal which ties us to the EU? B) A deal such as the Canada deal? C) No deal. B or C for me! What say you?
1334439330027343873 2020-12-03 18:08:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @mosiestearn No. The Devil will be allowed to get America to dance to his tune. New alliances will need to be made with former foes, rather quickly.
1334437834770538497 2020-12-03 18:02:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> TV. Advertisements are obviously aimed at the BAME market, why then do they invariably have a black male with a white female. Hardly ever a white male with a black female. @BorisJohnson is this a Gvt directive? A NEW IDEA for advertisers try a White female with a White male!
1334420235768696832 2020-12-03 16:52:31 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Attention @dailymail @femail Perhaps tomorrow you will display “PJ’s that are a dream to wear” from Next, Matalan, M&amp;S, Aldi, Lidle, Primark, Newlook, Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury??? Why feature Top end shops only? Cater for ALL your readers.

1334136577887449091 2020-12-02 22:05:21 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> May I suggest a vote for Stuart Broad a great cricketing hero, a sound sportsman, a nice guy and a very articulate individual. A constant presence in the England Cricket team.   Stuart Broad deserves your support. He is A credit to the Country.
1334131539689484289 2020-12-02 21:45:20 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Scifiscreen Thank You Allan.
1334116336893628418 2020-12-02 20:44:56 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn Except picking Pogba.
1334116056361803777 2020-12-02 20:43:49 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bruce_bwkm It all depends on what music you play.
1334115112848863245 2020-12-02 20:40:04 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn But it does not help when the Vaccine Minister s starts his role frightening people. The man is over promoted and should be sent back to the back benches.
1334114654428270601 2020-12-02 20:38:14 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn I am having it.
1334114091523248128 2020-12-02 20:36:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @oliviakitface Yes they have been arriving daily on rubber dinghies.
1334102506104827906 2020-12-02 19:49:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn God forbid, that means Pogba is back.

1334033751718957057 2020-12-02 15:16:46 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Goodness. @BorisJohnson gets kicked up the backside yesterday. Now the vaccine is approved. Something that normally takes years is suddenly approved. Goodness, I will not be rushing for it.
1334015531192623104 2020-12-02 14:04:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Listening to some Conservative MP’s yesterday trying to justify why they were supporting @BorisJohnson in a further episode of bringing the Country and the people down further, in quite pathetic speeches. One woman asking “if we throw it out what do we do then” God help us.

1334010823245762562 2020-12-02 13:45:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Those suggesting sinister reasons for the COVID-19 vaccination, were given a boost by the idiotic words from the Vaccination Minister Nadhim Zahawi  (Proving to be a prick) suggesting that we will need proof of having had the vaccine to fly, attend concerts, sporting events etc

1333895977388957698 2020-12-02 06:09:18 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @djc547 Play it down David. This is, as well you know, a major kick up the backside to this Prime Minister. He now knows he is not as safe as he was one year ago. A poor Brexit now will be his Swansong. He is seriously out of favour by the public.
1333894889956892672 2020-12-02 06:04:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @DCBMEP BUT, David, Johnson has agreed to stay within the ECHR.

I do not envy people who earn high wages and act as an MP. they have been elected and must have impressed the voters. We are not as yet a Communist Country.
1333857661427871747 2020-12-02 03:37:03 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @oflynnsocial Gove was not there. The man sitting by the PM is from the Leader of the House Office, an MP obviously.
1333852457437437954 2020-12-02 03:16:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I would think that any reasonable minded court of law would rule that by allowing the boat migrants into the Country hosting them in expensive hotels was tantamount to welcoming them to the UK and they must be allowed to stay. AM I WRONG? The Q must be WHY allow them to stay?
1333833443550121984 2020-12-02 02:00:49 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @WendyPuerto @BorisJohnson I agree with you Wendy. The smirking Hancock alongside the  Terrible Prime Minister. Then this new appointment of the Vaccination Minister issuing those insidious threats to free speech and movement. This lot have got to go.

Possibly someone going to A&amp;E with symptoms of the virus which affected the staff at one and for safety this has happened. Obvious to me Ambulances will still take cases in to A&amp;E.
1333814160140931072 2020-12-02 00:44:11 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @WendyPuerto @SeanAKehoe @Roxyferry I missed the post. What is this about please.
1333784865905340417 2020-12-01 22:47:47 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Roydini25 But they could be redeveloped into excellent apartments with in house facilities for migrants! surely?
1333783582855155715 2020-12-01 22:42:41 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Hancock is an arrogant, boastful man. I always judge men on one criteria. If I was in some kind of physical danger, would I want this man alongside me. Hancock would be of no use whatsoever.
1333782568378875911 2020-12-01 22:38:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @DCBMEP @talarana89 Very interesting indeed. Sadly I am at the stage with this administration that I do not trust them or believe what they say. We shall see what transpires.
1333744530831642630 2020-12-01 20:07:30 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Bigdogdigs Shout ITS A NORMAL CHRISTMAS AFTER ALL!
1333744364485570561 2020-12-01 20:06:50 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> JUST KEEP ALERT....this day could be a good day to issue a press release on Brexit that slips under the radar....JUST SAYING.
1333725539761328129 2020-12-01 18:52:02 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> When the truth of this Chinese Pandemic and the vaccination are eventually revealed. Any scientist, politician involved in any small way will face an extremely angry mob.
1333725014424760322 2020-12-01 18:49:57 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SeanAKehoe And terribly obese.
1333724829384585216 2020-12-01 18:49:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SeanAKehoe President elect you forgot that pimple Ireland.
1333718370529796096 2020-12-01 18:23:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @JohnBro18028263 @BorisJohnson He will probably try to lie and tell us it only applies to a certain issue! My reply would be Foot in the door. We are either Out or Not Out. This PM needs to get a backbone.
1333715312966045696 2020-12-01 18:11:24 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Appalling, @BorisJohnson the terrible effect YOUR measures have on schools &amp; pupils missing lessons. Since March my grandson has lost 150 school days,including four weeks of isolation since September as a result of a contact on the school bus &amp; in his year group. Get a grip man.
1333713023618473984 2020-12-01 18:02:18 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Britain was bombed, during the war. Did that stop us working? WE have had outbreaks of Polio, Foot and Mouth disease, Mad Cow, Measles, Chicken Pox, Fevers, all manners of viruses and diseases! NO LOCKDOWNS. What makes this virus so bad we close down the country? @BorisJohnson
1333710180161380352 2020-12-01 17:51:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @OirishPatrick I find the weekly Mail fair on Brexit, from my point of view. It is the Weekend Mail which are rather watery. Wish you and yours  well for the Christmas like no others.
1333709265585000448 2020-12-01 17:47:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @OirishPatrick Page 10. James Franey. John Stevens.
1333702923470172160 2020-12-01 17:22:10 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Just asking, if we are still tied to the ECHR could French fishermen take us to that court for depriving them of their living?
1333702670784360450 2020-12-01 17:21:10 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @JohnBro18028263 @BorisJohnson John, we shall see in the final deal. But it will take days to carefully sift through the legal jargon, if ever we are allowed to see it in full, to know just how Brexit this Brexit is going to be. But if they have their claws in us through the ECHR we are in for a constant fight
1333701820221419520 2020-12-01 17:17:47 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> What did Esther Rantzen call them “JOBSWORTH”  https://t.co/9qZenF6uD0
1333699475991359488 2020-12-01 17:08:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @OirishPatrick The Daily Mail. I did not realise I had cut it.
1333689155159797760 2020-12-01 16:27:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> DID you know the Gvt had told us that we would be tied to the ECHR? the Court we were promised we would not be tied to? So we will never rid this country of illegals then! Another disastrous decision but this awful Prime Minister.  https://t.co/hxra0qJU62

1333682322340786178 2020-12-01 16:00:18 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @dinglette1972 @keith_bloke It is not. You can quite easily see it is a kick to the back of the leg which had a delayed reaction. To call him a cheat is wrong. I have never seen a player kicked so many times as he was last night. It was a definite plan by West Ham. Grealish should be protected.
1333681298410450944 2020-12-01 15:56:14 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bruce_bwkm Guido will publish the list of those that vote against the measures. That list should be passed along every week to remind people whom they can trust. Not on the list is for the chop.
1333677495095341057 2020-12-01 15:41:08 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Sajid Javid has written an excellent article on Islamist terrorism and the start of the project ‘Understanding Islamism’ an initiative by Policy Exchange. Javid as Home Secretary would, I have no doubt, have published the report of the rape gangs. He should replace Priti Patel.

1333532270012096517 2020-12-01 06:04:03 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @johnredwood This prime minister has lied on so many occasions. Has sat back and done nothing as the country degenerates into a Mob Controlled Country. The mob being what was once a proud highly respected police force I gave thirty years of my life to. This Prime Minister needs to be sacked.

1333505539960090628 2020-12-01 04:17:50 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @zero_to_here_oh What has gone wrong with the Metropolitan Police. They should be taken over by the County forces surrounding the once great Met. Kent, Surrey, Essex, Hertfordshire, etc. The City of London Police should take over Westminster and central London. The Met are unfit for purpose.
1333500633555619843 2020-12-01 03:58:20 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Michael Gove is a real and present danger to our democracy. I fear he is working against a No Deal Brexit to push @BorisJohnson out of the door. On lock downs he is a hardliner. Sorry Gove is the Trotsky in number 10.
1333478889939734530 2020-12-01 02:31:56 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @wemustleave1 She will try anything. But I get so annoyed watching Blackford spitting out his vile anti English diatribe.

1333351144521936896 2020-11-30 18:04:19 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bruce_bwkm still paying the Italian, USA based judge? Bringing back that shouting unintelligible judge from Germany? Giving more points to their favourite than that dance deserved? The bitchy comment from the OZ judge trying to put down Anton Du Beke? Or the two charisma less presenters?
1333347302841479170 2020-11-30 17:49:04 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @yjdhillhead @BorisJohnson @pritipatelmp @DominicRaab @KeirStarmerPM @Nigel_Farage @ClarkeMicah Good for you. Are you an expert witness on such matters, a professional photographer or just your opinion.
1333346536491769862 2020-11-30 17:46:01 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BillEtheridgeuk Well said Bill. Too little too late say I.
1333346350717677568 2020-11-30 17:45:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I hope the Speaker will just state that on the COVID-19 regulations, to be discussed on Tuesday, only English Members can participate and vote. This is a devolved matter. I also hope That each MP for an English Constituency makes that point too.
1333345343950479360 2020-11-30 17:41:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Most papers articulate what the public are saying or thinking. Those goor rather SHOULD be governing us, ignore any suggestions made. This week @BorisJohnson  MUST listen to the cries for help from small businesses, pubs etc we want them OPEN not closed down.
1333329254818471940 2020-11-30 16:37:21 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Stephen Glover, writing in the DM. Takes apart Micheal Goves mammoth article. In which Gove argued in favour of COVID tiers. Gove turning from a deeply thoughtful man into the hard man of The cabinet. Similarly the once fighter for fishermen is urging Boris to get a EU trade deal
1333158818319130628 2020-11-30 05:20:05 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Green Issues. No petrol, No diesel, obviously No coal. So what happens to the Steam Trains and the volunteers running these railroads. Another Question to @BorisJohnson which will be ignored.
1333153835125264390 2020-11-30 05:00:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson was going to sort out the swamp. He is proving to be the worst. Imprisoning us on the say so of a small cabal of scientists causing unemployment etc. The army is going after those raising genuine fears of the vaccine! GS4 policing our streets. This is 30’s Germany.

Policing what was a peaceful demonstration and being attacked by yobs in uniform, WHO changed the law?
1333140026440495106 2020-11-30 04:05:25 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SeanAKehoe @metpoliceuk They will have been sworn in as Special Constables. But, surely, this has to be an order signed in the Privy Council. Otherwise someone who authorised this will be in serious trouble. I am amazed the Police Federation is not shouting from the rooftops at this. @polfedchair

Johnson should be given the roasting of his lifetime. The people deserve every MP of ALL Party’s to stand as one for their constituents and tell the Prime Minister to scrap these communistic rules.
1332790512718385163 2020-11-29 04:56:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The police today, marching in columns, reminded me of 1930 Germany. Soon someone will organise these protestors, unless the Home Sec &amp; @BorisJohnson wake up to what THEY have created. I do pray that Conservative MP’s stamp their authority and change PM’s mind.

1332583058097270784 2020-11-28 15:12:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The Labour Party is almost certain to back the Governments COVID Tier system (Lockdown)! And also support whatever trade deal at whatever cost with the EU. Boris will have turned his great majority into a disastrous coalition with the Labour Party.
1332572585129861120 2020-11-28 14:30:36 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> BAD news this morning. @BorisJohnson is stepping into the EU Trade Talks. It is reported he cowardly slipped into the Spending Review the scrapping of his firm promise on Superfast broadband to every home by 2025, his pledge to honour the UN Migrants concord. He is a loose cannon
1332445950980329486 2020-11-28 06:07:25 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> After endorsing the United Nations Migrants accord. We can expect @BorisJohnson to put a bill to Parliament Giving an Amnesty to ALL illegal migrants. This will not be greeted by a vast majority of the indigenous British people. Any politician voting for this will lose their seat
1332441193083441161 2020-11-28 05:48:30 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Hghoda @si_talopram Another nail in his Premiership. Contrary to all his promises on Immigration.  Global Migration / World Government. Who, what is this man Boris Johnson?

1332431268924043269 2020-11-28 05:09:04 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I cannot believe that Sky News is most trusted news organisation. Utterly ridiculous. Kay Burley and Adam Boulton are ghastly creatures. So left wing they NEVER turn right!

1332243426633523200 2020-11-27 16:42:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GeoffreyDonald7 @BorisJohnson Read my first tweet on Hancock.
1332243272115294208 2020-11-27 16:42:02 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Geoffrey_Cox  The House of Commons needs someone with Gravitas and a commanding presence to knock some sense into the Master of the SS United Kingdom, which is heading into a maelstrom. Someone to put the case of the people, who are being ignored, Boris is v wary of you.
1332240489463083008 2020-11-27 16:30:59 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SeanAKehoe The Court of Public Opinion has decided by 250.000.000. Votes to back you.
1332240104539172865 2020-11-27 16:29:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> If @BorisJohnson, to get a deal, bows under pressure, And changes his long term pledge to have our own State Aid rules to align with the EU. That will be the end of his Premiership. In less than twelve months he has plummeted from Hero to almost Zero.
1332238824504758272 2020-11-27 16:24:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GeoffreyDonald7 @BorisJohnson But she can be made Secretary of State for Health.
1332238259817164802 2020-11-27 16:22:07 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SeanAKehoe You will be at the bottom of the queue.
1332236206961258496 2020-11-27 16:13:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GeoffreyDonald7 @BorisJohnson The saintly Virginia Bottomley.
1332236064711380992 2020-11-27 16:13:24 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> “Have I got News for You” tonight has Jo Brand in the Chair. She is not impartial, she is not funny, she swears constantly....This programme should have been shelved when Angus Deayton was sacked. @bbcDirectorGeneral @bbcChairman do your duty.
1332234704125366272 2020-11-27 16:07:59 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spcb @RuthLeaEcon Prime Cuts..methinks you are watching too many cookery programmes.
1332234373953949696 2020-11-27 16:06:41 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson  YOU MUST change the Secretary of State for Health. He is positively loving his role and just angers people daily. Appoint a person who can calm the situation. A person with gravitas and certainly not HUNT. A woman is needed urgently. Bring back Virginia!
1332233233514303491 2020-11-27 16:02:09 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SeanAKehoe Goodness me, are you now Uncle Joe?
1332232492988985344 2020-11-27 15:59:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SeanAKehoe Congratulations President Elect.
1332231936526479360 2020-11-27 15:56:59 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spcb @RuthLeaEcon I am astounded that the BBC have not signed up Valance and Whitty as the new Two Ronnies, they fit perfectly into the BBC model of comics (Unfunny) but with canned laughter they could make these two hilarious. Boris Johnson is the new Harry Worth?
1332229717634715650 2020-11-27 15:48:10 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson @DominicRaab  The arrogance of this Gvt. Faced with the disgust and anger that so much Foreign Aid money goes to Countries such as China. Dominic Raab has said he will still be sending money to CHINA! They do not give two figs to what the taxpayers say. IT MUST STOP
1332227341997780992 2020-11-27 15:38:44 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Will the UK Government place the Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish Offices in those countries. To ensure monies from the central purse is spent on what it has been given for. Giving these Offices powers to oversee and authority to check the books etc.
1332225750188093441 2020-11-27 15:32:25 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> So @BorisJohnson has announced a former top civil servant to be the successor to Dominic Cummings. Dan Rosenfield. So the Civil Service can carry on regardless. A shake up will not happen. What a total let down this Prime Minister has become. U Turn Man.
1332224829932630016 2020-11-27 15:28:45 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GrahamJ18821678 @aliceclara69 That is an unknown. They may have allowed life to carry on regardless! The desperation to keep this lot in power is quite extraordinary.  2021 we are a truly independent Country I want a dynamic forward thinking government and will vote for the party who have the team to do that.
1332222468279373824 2020-11-27 15:19:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> During the campaign for the Devolved Administrations and London Mayor, one hopes there will be a very strict watch on the news media and in Voting Stations. Especially in Wales where 16year olds and Foreign Nationals can vote. The scope for voting irregularities could be high.
1332221028102189056 2020-11-27 15:13:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Will the Welsh Assembly now wasting taxpayers money on an enquiry into links with slavery on any public monument, street names etc also look at similar links to the Communist Party of street names, statues too? Or politicians honoured by street names, any suspicious links?
1332083736003948546 2020-11-27 06:08:06 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn See you at Zolos .
1332080409518157825 2020-11-27 05:54:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @JennaEllisEsq @Norwayhornet Well said Jenna. We are under attack by the Devils Disciples No doubt about it. Stand firm.
1332012714055639043 2020-11-27 01:25:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Would the Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford who said re the tv programme ‘Get me out of here’ releasing foreign cockroaches, spiders, maggots and worms could pose a danger to human health and wildlife. Would he say the same about Migrants bringing an Alien way of life to Wales?
1332010810156199948 2020-11-27 01:18:19 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The answer to the tier nonsense is that the Lockdown either Did not work OR the weak Prime Minister desperate to give us Christmas bowed to the pressure from the Experts &amp; Bancock. So the refrain to Referees “You don’t know what you’re doing” Has to be directed at @BorisJohnson
1331956093438881794 2020-11-26 21:40:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Time to stop broadcasting Politics Today, Question Time, Newsnight, Religious, Cookery, BBC News. ALL ‘Comedy’ Shows. Then de-commission the commissioning departments for all these programmes. Advertise for fresh blood from outside the BBC to revitalise and create POPULAR  progs.
1331904189895733248 2020-11-26 18:14:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SeanAKehoe Sean, What is truth? What is right or wrong? When billionaires can control countries, when corrupt politicians can get elected by dubious means, when those we once trusted are more corrupt than the ones they are supposed to be catching, What can we, the herd do?
1331895951385038849 2020-11-26 17:41:54 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Robbietheranger Robbie, how kind. Yes I am a young 76 year old! Thanks.

1331893741481824256 2020-11-26 17:33:08 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @mikeyonman What in the House of Commons, with the Saintly Virginia? Never,sir, Never!!!
1331892071641337856 2020-11-26 17:26:29 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Can I ask just what ‘Father of the House’ Peter Bottomley MP. Has achieved during his too many years as an MP?
1331891537987444738 2020-11-26 17:24:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SeanAKehoe Indeed, but after we are all dragged screaming and the vaccination forced into us. You Sean will be the last.
1331885988889718789 2020-11-26 17:02:19 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SeanAKehoe Sean, You will be the subject of a book. “The man who did not get vaccinated”
1331884877675945986 2020-11-26 16:57:54 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> MP’s are, surely, civil staff and as such must have their pay frozen too. I wish to see a far more OPEN and stringent test on expenses for both Houses of Parliament. They MUST tighten their belts too.
1331884306105561089 2020-11-26 16:55:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I welcomed the Chancellors statement yesterday. It is obvious to most, except former prime ministers and MP’s, that we shall have to face tax increases to pay off our debt. IF I have to pay more tax I insist the overseas aid budget MUST END COMPLETELY.
1331882344945479680 2020-11-26 16:47:50 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @RamshawJanice Like we English, wherever we go.  The Yorkshire dialect is part Norman too. They can never understand some words, such as “Your turn to get a round in”.
1331881409401720833 2020-11-26 16:44:07 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I do agree with the Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford who told the producers of ‘Get me out of here’ that releasing foreign cockroaches, spiders, maggots and worms could pose a danger to human health and wildlife. Goodness the stupidity of people. ITN should demand answers.
1331695343285768193 2020-11-26 04:24:46 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SeanAKehoe Employers could make it a condition of employment. “For the health and well being of colleagues”.
1331661313160974337 2020-11-26 02:09:32 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @markinneswilli Good. They live in a cosseted world.  I always think of the scene in Frost/Nixon when President Nixon, after the programme, at home wakes to a recording of  Hail to the Chief. They still think they are relevant. They are not. ZIP IT XPM’s, Gone and best ignored.

1331590641474809860 2020-11-25 21:28:43 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I welcome @BorisJohnson ‘s reply at PMQ’s That “We will not budge on our seas and fishing and they (the EU) had better accept it”. But the devil is in the detail so I shall wait and see the Trade Deal , if there is one, and see if ground (seas) have been given before apologising.
1331572495565139968 2020-11-25 20:16:37 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Let us never forget that the charmless snob Jeremy HUNT was a long serving Secretary of State for Health. What did he do to ensure the NHS has sufficient stocks to deal with any Pandemic this country may face, He should figure largely in any enquiry as he was woeful and lazy.
1331570855541936128 2020-11-25 20:10:06 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @KevinJAlderton1 👍👀
1331570778547122176 2020-11-25 20:09:47 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @t5monkey Indeed On June 18, 1812, President James Madison signed a declaration of war against Great Britain, marking the beginning of the War of 1812. The strength of the British army proved too great for U.S. forces. Both on land and at sea, U.S. troops suffered great losses.

1331521862883545088 2020-11-25 16:55:25 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @KevinJAlderton1 Indeed. We should bring it back. When the Queen sadly dies there should be a fight between Charles and the leader of the Stuarts for the throne. Best of three fights. Sword, Wrestling and trial by torture. That will get the crowds into the O2. Live on box office.

ON this day in 1120, William Adelin, son and heir of Henry I of England (b. 1104) dies in White Ship tragedy trying to save his illegitimate half-sister Countess of Perche while crossing the English Channel. Read The White Ship by Charles Spencer. Brilliant book.

In Wales we know the Puritan in charge will certainly Keep us locked into something. We must kick them all out come the Assembly Election.

1331363060565602304 2020-11-25 06:24:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The Democrats have ALWAYS hated The United Kingdom. The ‘Special Arrangement’ is totally one sided. Now look away from The USA. They are trying to stoke up the hatred of the IRA with their total nonsense on Brexit. Remember It was the Democrats who had a plan to declare war on us

1331318170804752388 2020-11-25 03:26:01 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bruce_bwkm According to Ancient stones, found on a small South Sea island, on which, in an ancient language is a prophecy.

1331192793071554561 2020-11-24 19:07:48 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Interesting to discover which MP’s haveNOT returned to Parliament since The Chinese Pandemic Started?  We should be told. JRM did say it was the Lawful duty of ALL MP’s to take their places within Parliament. Frankly to see so few in attendance makes a mockery of our Democracy.
1331162373537882112 2020-11-24 17:06:56 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MaryLou4559 @RishiSunak How can these figures be justified? @BorisJohnson must speak to the Nation. It may be a drop in the ocean to politicians/mandarins BUT think what the £90million to India (who are in the Space race) could do for small UK charities! Charity begins at home PM.
1331161534584774656 2020-11-24 17:03:36 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MaryLou4559 @RishiSunak And here was me thinking Pakistan had moved TO the UK !
1331155895439462401 2020-11-24 16:41:11 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @RishiSunak We are in great debt BUT How can we, in all honesty, continue to pour money into International aid? £81 million to China is ridiculous as is the profligacy within Whitehall Departments. IF WE are going to have to pay more in tax GVT  Departments must feel the pinch.
1331151105280126976 2020-11-24 16:22:09 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Christi40330644 Totally agree. But the Aid Industry, you know the charities with overpaid executives living off our taxes etc.

1331149645054173184 2020-11-24 16:16:21 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @DevonshireDanUK Yes, but how do we attain such perfection. This lot ares as bad as the last lot. Perhaps a Military take over....but that is why politicians want to reduce their numbers. They FEAR that.
1331146452861669378 2020-11-24 16:03:40 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SeanAKehoe I believe Sean lays it out with great clarity.
1331145837389488128 2020-11-24 16:01:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn No but two May!
1331145737678315523 2020-11-24 16:00:50 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Will this Government @BorisJohnson do anything they promised. How can £81 Million to CHINA in overseas AID be justified? This &amp; further revelations by DM of Whitehall’s profligacy with Tax Payers money has to stop. Will any MP demand action? Real Cuts to Overseas Aid Badly Needed
1330968052570222592 2020-11-24 04:14:46 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @martinof_martin I reckon you could be spot on.

1330799772710678528 2020-11-23 17:06:05 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Our public finances are in a dire state &amp; we really need responsible &amp; fiscally prudent people in charge of the Country. With @BorisJohnson’s record I ask a Q Is he the Right person to be First Lord of the Treasury? Never forget His Bridge (£40Billion) + HS2 £120B &amp; rising.
1330793667217534976 2020-11-23 16:41:49 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> ⁦@BorisJohnson⁩ Please, this week especially, remember our Fishermen and the Fishing Industry. Do not betray them, and us.

YOU must stop use of ‘Gold credit Cards’ BAN using expensive Chic Restaurants and TakeAways. CHARGE individuals. This money cannot be written off.
1330787851185876993 2020-11-23 16:18:43 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> 1. The Taxpayers Alliance have produced a devastating report on waste of OUR TAXES by Whitehall. £.5,577,988.036.64. To be exact. 1st class Airtravel. Luxury Restaurants, A day at Bristol Zoo. (£500K spent by Health Dept for ‘Bong Bongs Manila Kanteen’ takeaways, during lockdown)

1330491789141299204 2020-11-22 20:42:16 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @truemagic68 I do agree. He was very firm in not announcing anything until the House of Commons receive the report first. I do admire the man.
1330490926645567488 2020-11-22 20:38:50 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @CarolineHutt @montie @BorisJohnson On Lord David Frost, I suspect that if Boris does agree a UTurn (a speciality of his) Lord Frost will resign.

You are suffering from a rare kind of dementia called ‘ Mancutdsillybugger ‘ first seen in Van Louis Van Gaal. It means that you do things you know you should not do. Such as put your hand/s👏in boiling water or shower in cold water.
1330425351051374595 2020-11-22 16:18:16 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @WatchMoron @BorisJohnson Sadly the Trust ship is slowly sinking. @BorisJohnson should remember what happened to Mrs May’s “deal”. And subsequently to her. Losing Cummings andCo. Was disastrous.
1330424471086358541 2020-11-22 16:14:46 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @WilliamNaughto3 As a member of The Free Speech Union. Freedom of speech is paramount. I am a fair minded man but I remember well the death of Princess Diana and the terrible reaction from the Royal Family. It was so bad the people were angry. To try to airbrush it would be an error of judgement.
1330416853903155200 2020-11-22 15:44:30 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Who disagrees?  https://t.co/iUAk7FARAs
1330412440358703108 2020-11-22 15:26:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> THE CROWN is extremely interesting and the actors/actresses (I am old fashioned) perform their roles brilliantly. The BLOB are demanding Netflix say scenes are fiction is ridiculous. Is it ‘friends’ of Prince Charles trying to airbrush his role? in this very dysfunctional family.

1330394448308662273 2020-11-22 14:15:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson  must speak, publicly to the British People, and stress that his promises on Brexit made in the Conservative Manifesto and many times since HAVE NOT and WILL NOT change. We will be master of the seas and our own destiny. Do not be cavalier on your promises. SPEAK UP
1330392913155682317 2020-11-22 14:09:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Bill Gates has joined the Archbishop of Canterbury, David Cameron and Bliar in demanding our overseas aid budget NOT to be cut. WHO does this billionaire Gates think he is? He has no right whatsoever to say anything As for Cameron &amp; Blair. Members of the ExPM Club Please ZIP IT.
1330391295907520513 2020-11-22 14:02:57 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> There is real fear that @BorisJohnson will cave in over fishing rights. I hope that Conservative MP’s will understand that blind obedience to Boris and voting through such a deal will ensure The ‘Red Wall’ will collapse. But it will prove once and for all that we Cannot trust him
1330387539761442816 2020-11-22 13:48:01 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I asked the Archbishop of Canterbury speak up for Christians to tell Gvt must respect our Christian Beliefs &amp; allow Christmas Services. Nothing forthcoming from Lambeth Palace but he has warned Overseas Aid must not be cut AND he is taking a Sabbatical. May I suggest he resigns!
1330275652046639104 2020-11-22 06:23:25 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn What is your verdict John. I did not see the game but if they can only get one goal against WBA something is not right. Who starred and who did not?
1330259622070988801 2020-11-22 05:19:43 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @lindawestmore He has lost Cummings. He has surrounded himself or should I say PM Carrie has surrounded him with her kitchen cabinet. We shall see what she has decided on the EU trade deal. But if he does sell us out, if Fishing is no longer a red line etc I do feel his end will be nigh.

1330080792979058691 2020-11-21 17:29:07 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MuffettDavid Hate is such a negative term. To use such you must prove this hate. So I await your evidence. You may have missed it. But Priti Patel has apologised. People do not apologise for nothing. YOU should be asking what is the point of a Ministerial Code? I would have been sacked.

1330049230606622720 2020-11-21 15:23:42 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The famous Red Box contains State Secrets, which all Ministers carry proudly. Now we learn the PM uses ‘What’sApp’  for such matters, aided it is alleged By PMCarrie. I would have thought such a method would be so easy for our enemies to learn much. Rather Daft, don’t you think?

1330045698532904961 2020-11-21 15:09:40 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> White, British and Proud. We took our Democracy, our Religion, our skills in farming, engineering, education, and inventions helping many Nations to grow. We did much good, for both our Nation and theirs. Be proud.
1330044275132870657 2020-11-21 15:04:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The Football Association of Ireland has opened an enquiry into the manager of their National team. He is said to have shown a ‘anti English’ video to his player to prepare them for the recent game against England. Does Stephen Kenny deserve to keep his job?  I bet he will keep it
1329881486330392584 2020-11-21 04:17:09 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn John, I fear the Rooney bank account is going to take a big hit. These sort of Court cases are extremely costly. Whoever wins will get their costs paid by the loser. Wayne will have to work longer. Probably still be playing in his late forties.

Killed by the insidious IED bomb. In Helmand Province, Afghanistan. So many men and women killed here. One day the truth will emerge as to Why?

1329748387059601411 2020-11-20 19:28:15 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @JoanRigby8 The full report has not been released and I doubt that it will. The Labour Party have demanded it be released. The fact that so many MP’s and Ministers are writing their support on Twitter etc, without reading the full report will end with you writing along similar lines to them?
1329747641916329986 2020-11-20 19:25:18 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @JoanRigby8 But, it is still bullying. People did lost of things ‘years ago’ we have to get away from that mindset. She does not need to be sacked but she has to be given her first warning. I truly worry when I see Twitter full of her Party friends saying how good she is. That does not help.
1329739403527380992 2020-11-20 18:52:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @truemagic68 David,give us your Desert Island Diss. Mine: Erik Satie,  Gymnopédies (any 1 of the 3). Dream Lover Bobby Darin.

1329708487870476289 2020-11-20 16:49:42 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I have been an admirer of Priti Patel and when she was appointed Home Secretary I was pleased. However bullying in any shape or form is not conducive with a Cabinet Minister. I do understand the utter frustration she must have felt, but it does not take away that she was wrong.
1329705814517538816 2020-11-20 16:39:05 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @KeyserSosse R.I.P. Lee and John. Two of the bravest of the brave, Elite soldiers killed in a helicopter crash. Serving Queen and Country. I salute both men

1329491800038526982 2020-11-20 02:28:40 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Frightening people with such stupid terms as Have a Merry Christmas then bury them in January. Dr. Gabriel Scally deserves to be kicked out immediately, but he gets his ideas, I reckon, from Dr. Death himself Matt Hancock. @BorisJohnson Major Trouble  If this continues.
1329388402144399360 2020-11-19 19:37:48 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Is @BorisJohnson ‘s next wheeze decriminalisation of illegal migrants and giving them all British Citizenship?
1329387914103549954 2020-11-19 19:35:52 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @DavidBlakeman13 I read your comment on Mr Bannermans tweet praising Boris.

The measures to contain the Plague were obviously the blue print to deal with COVID (Chinese Pandemic). Highly recommend.

1329325987960659974 2020-11-19 15:29:47 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GillianCadwall1 I cannot speak for ALL but my view is that we will have a number of popular new or newish political parties. The Hard left will have their own, the middle ground will have a number of parties, The Reform Party and others on the right. ALL will favour  Proportional Representation.
1329314890062979073 2020-11-19 14:45:41 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Will @BorisJohnson create a new Ministry for Green Issues. Secretary of State Zak Goldsmith, Green Minister Caroline Lucas. The shape of things to come!
1329314127089704962 2020-11-19 14:42:40 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I think the Tory party will never recover from COVID-19 (The Chinese Pandemic) the largesse shown to Tory friends over PPE, but the total disaster called BORIS. The man who without a debate changed the direction and amalgamated with the Green Party.

1329282898093027329 2020-11-19 12:38:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Will Caractacus become a fashionable name now after Jacob Rees Mogg mentioned him as a great British hero?

1329105943636955136 2020-11-19 00:55:25 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @DrTeckKhong It simply shows the power an unelected person with no Official position, having not been elected, can determine policy.

Exporting energy intensive jobs to India and China where both are building a coal fired power station every week producing relatively cheap electricity
1329059776660185089 2020-11-18 21:51:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> London, 18 November: The Global Warming Policy Forum (GWPF) today described the Prime Minister’s 10 Point Plan for a 'Green Industrial Revolution' as shallow gesture politics, but a gesture with severely negative economic implications from day one into the foreseeable future.

I have had been anti the EU following John Major didn’t  give us a referendum on Maastricht. UKIP/BREXIT did extremely well in the EU Parliament elections. They got our referendum.

1328974414671736832 2020-11-18 16:12:46 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Will space flights be banned from the UK. Or will they have to be electrically powered and rely on solar energy as they fly through space. There again is this the end of jumbo jets? Who would fly on pure electric.

1328971670774800384 2020-11-18 16:01:52 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> All the headlines are, rightly, on the nine years till sales of new Diesel/petrol cars but also quoted was central heating/hot water boilers for homes. The end of Gas/oil boilers who pays? Massive proposals which will create great financial difficulties for a great many families.

This government is a closed shop

1328962510570057733 2020-11-18 15:25:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The amount of money thrown at companies linked to friends of Ministers, MP’s and advisers for PFP is shocking. Panic may have been a contributing factor but on what basis was the money awarded arrived at? It stinks and they will tax us to pay for their largesse.
1328959962735923202 2020-11-18 15:15:20 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> IN this new Green revolution, which no Tory or others voted for, can we be told, please, what plans are afoot for second hand cars? What is the lifetime for them?
1328951298364936196 2020-11-18 14:40:54 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The DM has details of the companies given eye watering contracts for PPE and other Government work, and their connections to people at the heart of the Tory party. Frankly it stinks. This will not go away. Forensic Starmer   has been given ample evidence to alarm the public.
1328948740359671808 2020-11-18 14:30:45 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ClaraWSparkles @BorisJohnson Excellent points. But in nine years time, I expect it will have changed. PM @BorisJohnson may well have been replaced. I can see a major re-think of this hastily cobbled together policy.
1328946969365065730 2020-11-18 14:23:42 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The EU trade talks show all the signs of a cobbled together deal with the mighty EU trampling over a weak UK! The talks, due to have finished months ago, but every ending date is ignored. It is about time @BorisJohnson got a backbone and called his team home. For a No deal.

1328943141592895489 2020-11-18 14:08:30 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ClaraWSparkles In nine years this will happen says @BorisJohnson  says It will help ‘even out’ the UK. He is on another planet. I do agree with you. The joy of seeing classic cars on the road will be lost. But what about the poorer people who rely on their ‘old bangers’ to get to and from work.
1328937593728282626 2020-11-18 13:46:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Yesterday, in praising Marcus Rashford’s latest pledge to get more young children reading books and for parents to read bedtime stories. I reminded him &amp; parents of the benefits of Public Libraries. PM @BorisJohnson praises Marcus but fails to mention this local resource Of books
1328935295761469441 2020-11-18 13:37:19 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> “Banning on NEW petrol and Diesel cars in the U.K. from 2030”. A part of what PM Carrie calls a “green industrial revolution”. The question has to be what restrictions will be placed on OLD petrol/diesel cars? A policy to hit the Poorer people. IS this making a fairer society.

1328797486882951170 2020-11-18 04:29:43 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The appointment of Allegra Stratton  must be reviewed we cannot have an Appointments Commission recommend a person for a job and the Prime Minister overrule that decision. IF Appointments Commission is not fit for purpose the PM should replace. The appointment must be reviewed.
1328795254619828226 2020-11-18 04:20:51 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @petemorristwit PM Carrie must have decided this policy.

1328713836900257792 2020-11-17 22:57:19 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @louhaley @paulwaugh @BorisJohnson It suggests to me that @borisjohnson is now in hiding. He is avoiding people and that is not what I expect from a leader.  If he has been declared Clear he should be at his desk. That is what we the Common People are told to do. This is quite extraordinary behaviour.

But when young school age children still wear nappies, we have a major problem in child care. Some parents are just useless at child care. Domestic Science for ALL students must return.

1328625897809776642 2020-11-17 17:07:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @because_other Indeed. I had spelyng tests every night.
1328624500825534464 2020-11-17 17:02:20 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @because_other Well said. But we had parents who could read. I am shocked by the number of adults , young adults, who cannot read. That could be one of the problems.
1328623619073863680 2020-11-17 16:58:50 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MikeAaronhall Governments should institute local research into illiteracy in adults.

Slaughtered by a IED Bomb whilst on vehicle patrol in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. When will there be a enquiry into our tactics, sending out brave men/women Into death traps?
1328618074484985857 2020-11-17 16:36:48 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MikeAaronhall Well Wrexham has thriving libraries throughout its bailiwick. I just cannot understand people like yourself that did nothing to stop such closures.

1328615828477063168 2020-11-17 16:27:52 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> SAD that Marcus Rashford does not tell children and their parents about Public Libraries. Unless parents cannot read, and that is not, sadly, unknown. Couldn’t Libraries hold reading lessons for parents. So they can read books to their children. That would be a win win, surely.

1328612403978887169 2020-11-17 16:14:16 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Blair brought in devolution as it was a big step towards EU regions. England would have disappeared, and Major Blair and Brown agreed that fact. it being split into regions whilst Wales, Ulster and Scotland remained regions. To keep devolution now would be Anti Brexit.
1328610497546113024 2020-11-17 16:06:41 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Marcus Rashford did not have any books as a child. His mother could not afford them. He is now on another crusade to open the joy of reading to children.  Surely now is the time for. Councils to ADVERTISE the great benefits of FREE Public Libraries.
1328605062541832193 2020-11-17 15:45:05 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> It is about time The @ArchbishopofCanterbury, who is no favourite of mine, and all his woke Bishops and vicars etc. Got their act together.

You cannot turn your back on our fishing industry. BREXIT means regaining our waters and independence. GET OUT VISITING and learning. Before you make a disastrous decision.

A birth surely is a Celebration. That is what Christmas is to me. SHOPS that make advertisements which have no bearing on a Christian Christmas will not get my money.
1328594608763363334 2020-11-17 15:03:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Christmas is our Christian Festival. If they try to ruin Christmas they will rue the day. Do they really think families will ignore family, friends &amp; Church Services? This experiment on people control is now beyond sinister! Time to call a halt. FILL the Churches at Christmas!

Everyone should start today,  brighten up their front windows, bring happiness to children on their way to school and back. Give hope to us all. Leave Mad Hancock in his dark cell of hopelessness, we must live and celebrate, in our way, the birth of Christ.
1328590806610046976 2020-11-17 14:48:26 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Rishi Sunak &amp; Alok Sharma are urging Boris to “compromise” to bind the UK to EU rules and allow greater access to fish than even our fishing industry. Those two best visit Grimsby, The South West PDQ &amp; LEARN! To ruin Brexit would not be good for their future.
1328581421011709952 2020-11-17 14:11:09 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> AT LAST some sense from @10DowningStreet  “Devolution was the worst decision of Tony Blair” says Boris. He was talking about Scotland. Devolution period has to be brought to an end. A costly and another tier of officialdom and fourth rate politicians. Parliament should end it.
1328580313342152704 2020-11-17 14:06:45 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> As followers will know I admire Richard Littlejohn. A fearless Writer, who speaks for millions.

1328339520685809666 2020-11-16 22:09:55 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @martin_tidd Thank you Martin.  Appreciated.
1328339345812697092 2020-11-16 22:09:14 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Rossva1189 Thank you Ross. Appreciated.
1328282902573035525 2020-11-16 18:24:56 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Hancock says it is NOT Mandatory to take the vaccine BUT he may have to make it mandatory. I am heartily sick of this ridiculous,publicity seeking arrogant man who is creating F E A R throughout Britain.
1328282322349793280 2020-11-16 18:22:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The question which the Prime Minister has to answer is WHY did you ignore the recommendation of the Appointments Committee for the individual to resent the Governments position on Daily televised Briefings.
1328272533150425089 2020-11-16 17:43:44 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @johnsmethurst Join the queue. But it is a terrific film (series).
1328271107049336838 2020-11-16 17:38:04 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @IsabelOakeshott Breathing Space?
1328270414867550209 2020-11-16 17:35:19 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @johnsmethurst Actually I read his article on the excellent film, on Netflix’s, “The Queen’s Gambit” and to discover that he is Chairman of the British Chess Association.
1328269625725947904 2020-11-16 17:32:11 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @johnsmethurst John, living in North Wales and the hundreds of windmills in the sea, and the hills (mountains),  are commonplace. but they do not amount enough to provide all the energy we require. But if they are a subtle plot to stop the daily migrant excursions, fair enough.
1328267922121379845 2020-11-16 17:25:25 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @KeyserSosse R.I.P. Peter. A brave young man Proud member of 2 Rifles. Slaughtered by the insidious IED bomb. In Helmand Province, Afghanistan. I hope Antony Beevor decides to write a book on Afghanistan and why Generals continued to place soldiers in such obvious danger.
1328266621727682560 2020-11-16 17:20:15 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GiannaMarriotta Celeste, And you a lady of the cloth!
1328266400964730882 2020-11-16 17:19:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @johnsmethurst John, Trouble is will those bills be Green Issues and other woke nonsense OR the promised Immigration, Levelling up of our society etc?
1328261330726510598 2020-11-16 16:59:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @slim_douglas @BorisJohnson Have a lovely day in Cyprus.
1328260182250561536 2020-11-16 16:54:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @slim_douglas @BorisJohnson I love Cyprus and Cypriots.
1328260004718272512 2020-11-16 16:53:57 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @slim_douglas @BorisJohnson He is the Prime Minister. It is going on under his watch. He has said, many times, the Buck stops with him, so I am directing my criticism to him. I am not alone. We voted for him. I thought he was Churchill Mark2 but he has turned into Jim Hacker.
1328259096454246400 2020-11-16 16:50:21 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @KingBobIIV @JenFullick @zarahsultana Years ago in Limehouse E14, prior to the redevelopment, there was a small but very interesting museum of the Labour Party. Created to speak for the downtrodden working class, who suffered great deprivations &amp; lived in very poor conditions. Now they are a woke party for the rich.
1328256255580889090 2020-11-16 16:39:03 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson  You have created a country ruled by FEAR, Fear of a virus. We have had viruses throughout the ages. But nothing like this where EVERYONE who dies,strangely dies from it. We do not die from natural causes anymore.The truth will out.
1328250989099487235 2020-11-16 16:18:08 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Lady Churchill didn’t interfere with the work of her husband, nor Mrs Attlee, Mrs MacMillan, Mrs Alec Douglas-Home, Mrs Wilson, Mrs Eden, Mrs Callaghan,  Mr Thatcher,Mrs Major, Mrs Blair?! Mrs Brown, Mrs Cameron, Mr May. Why the change now @BorisJohnson
1328248394423300097 2020-11-16 16:07:49 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Major is suggesting two referendums for the Scots. Typical from this hypocrite who refused the British people a referendum on the Maastricht Treaty. Another “I know best” useless politician.
1328246666907021314 2020-11-16 16:00:57 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Patrick70633049 Islam’s big mistake is that they do not accept the British. BUT weak politicians have given in to them far too much. The media do not help, they perpetuate the lie that ALL whites are racist. The BBC is fast becoming the Black Broadcasting Corporation.
1328244812793909248 2020-11-16 15:53:35 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @HaineSharan It is grey again today..
1328244463978885120 2020-11-16 15:52:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> WHO ,of the present cabinet should be removed? One choice.....mine being Hancock.  and one to bring back (They are talking of big beasts) My choice Geoffrey Cox. He frightens Boris because of his towering intellect and presence.
1328243395660312577 2020-11-16 15:47:57 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @honey1962 That was good to read.
1328243227225436161 2020-11-16 15:47:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @johnsmethurst Probably, although if the man had any guts he would have scrapped most quangos by now. We thought we were voting for Churchill Mark2 but have got Jim Hacker instead.
1328242658251247621 2020-11-16 15:45:01 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @vadim59955932 Yes. I think someone else’s  plug will be pulled soon. We did not vote for Woke or Green issues. If @BorisJohnson wants more Windmills he could buy a toy one for his new child.
1328242123922173958 2020-11-16 15:42:54 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> RULES Government have created for COVID are plainly disgusting. Families unable to be with elderly relatives in care homes. Disabled children in care homes are denied visits by parents. Funerals policed by jobsworths, Lonely people / One parent families. WHERE is the compassion?
1328240230969843712 2020-11-16 15:35:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @DavidBlakeman13 He has not conceded! He said Biden wine by cheating.
1328240003026219009 2020-11-16 15:34:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SeanAKehoe Positive thinking Sean,
1328239695160078337 2020-11-16 15:33:15 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @johnsmethurst So, another untrustworthy MP who hides behind his staff.
1328239242087198720 2020-11-16 15:31:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MalcolmCowing Malcolm, have to wear them when visiting the surgery, dentist, certain shops. But generally I don’t. I have amazed myself how compliant I have become. But thank you for your advice.
1328237648134156288 2020-11-16 15:25:07 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MalcolmCowing Malcolm, being a spectacle wearer, wearing the masks I find I am walking in a perpetual fog, also wearing hearing aids is, for me, impossible as the elastic flicks the aids out. I cannot be the only one. So if I wear a mask I leave my hearing aids at home plus my spectacles.
1328236674598494209 2020-11-16 15:21:15 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @vadim59955932 You are right. But I just cannot understand who and why he is being touted for a comeback. The only truth is he is close to PM Carrie?
1328226545371066369 2020-11-16 14:41:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Whilst wishing @BorisJohnson well whilst self isolating. I must say the photograph of him standing next to Lee Anderson MP, who later was diagnosed having the virus, Was not good. Neither wearing masks. This just feeds those that believe that masks are useless.
1328225740647751682 2020-11-16 14:37:48 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Sajid Javid is being pushed to be returned to the cabinet. He was turning out to be an excellent Home Secretary. It was he that set up the enquiry into the rape gangs. No doubt if he returned to that post HE will publish the full report?
1328225148126842881 2020-11-16 14:35:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> THE appointments panel, after interviews, recommended one person to be the daily representative of the Government, in the daily TV briefings on policy. WHY did the PM ignore that and choose Allegra Stratton? If correct what is the point of the panel?
1328092768770662400 2020-11-16 05:49:25 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Brink_Thinker Hello.
1328069601167601666 2020-11-16 04:17:21 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @robertwlk Some with me and Penny. Penny less.
1328006867730259968 2020-11-16 00:08:05 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Startinglifeag1 Spot on.
1328006659621482503 2020-11-16 00:07:15 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SeanAKehoe Of course. Start back at Gordon Brown directing police not to believe the young girls, then Home Secretaries who ignored the girls, Chief Constables, Children’s Homes staff,who knew, police officers who ignored the plight of the girls, that’s why they will not release that report
1328004633047031813 2020-11-15 23:59:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn Yes superb.
1327999732942303234 2020-11-15 23:39:44 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @joymorrissey @BorisJohnson Well it is good to see a nice comment from a totally independent person.

1327998628594671618 2020-11-15 23:35:20 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn You are a kind heart John.
1327973791662747648 2020-11-15 21:56:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bear44willis Andrew. I respect your opinion but I prefer to look at how they operate in Government. Wherever he has been he did and does a sterling job. I support workers who do things not the others. Anyway I reckon Gove’s time May be up.
1327972650908594176 2020-11-15 21:52:07 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @wilkinson1ps @BorisJohnson Yes, Boris and he can swop notes on talent.
1327970246448324608 2020-11-15 21:42:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @wilkinson1ps @BorisJohnson You have got to be joking.
1327970079615705088 2020-11-15 21:41:54 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bgir So you do not know if it is true or not?
1327969670448680961 2020-11-15 21:40:16 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson @LewisHamilton How much tax does he pay into our tax system? I am certainly not proud of him.
1327968487831121920 2020-11-15 21:35:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bear44willis What, MAY and Co? And dear cuddly Boris?
1327968192766095360 2020-11-15 21:34:24 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Has Micheal Gove been sidelined? George Eustace on all the airways this morning doing the Gove stuff.Could It be the Siren (of Greek Mythology) luring the PM into making yet another bad decision and, subsequently, to his doom. We must be told.
1327965619774484480 2020-11-15 21:24:10 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ClarkeMicah Peter, have you noticed the bully boys wearing police fluorescent jackets are older in the main men. Not the young ones quivering on the pavement. ARE they indeed police or  employees of Security Companies? Just asking.
1327964546812809216 2020-11-15 21:19:55 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson You cannot, in your usual style, ignore the problems you have caused. You owe it, not least to those that voted for you to apologise for the mess you have created. Assure us that your fiancée does not see Top Secret documents? &amp; promise not to budge in the EU talks.
1327962804079501317 2020-11-15 21:12:59 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @1Fubar Jimmy, You are doing an essential public service. Keep it up.
1327911934054764544 2020-11-15 17:50:51 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @cwjdavis @BorisJohnson Well, we have been duped.
1327893417133830145 2020-11-15 16:37:16 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @leckston If you ever have the opportunity to go to one of his shows GO. He is excellent. Great musician. I think he can play most instruments. Terrific entertainment and very funny too.
1327892500812591104 2020-11-15 16:33:37 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Micheal Gove is, so it is reported, the man Cummings and Co went to for authority to proceed on issues. Will PM Carrie try to remove him. But that would create a real alternative leader on the back-benches. Boris has got to stop ANY interference from his fiancée in Gvt business.
1327889043196153857 2020-11-15 16:19:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @kelvmackenzie He has caved in. That is why I am asking WHO is Boris Johnson. By the way your tweet relating to PM Carrie Has been poo pooed in an article by Dan Hodges in the DM. Keep up the good work Kelvin.
1327886834781876224 2020-11-15 16:11:07 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> WE watched, for the first time this year,Strictly. Now that the wokeness had been removed and that screaming judge, because of COVID. Anton Du Beke was a superb judge. Being positive and any criticism given was constructive. Bill Bailey, a brilliant musician &amp; comedian, impressed

1327883983770804224 2020-11-15 15:59:47 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @LewtonSerena5 Thank you Elizabeth. Spoken from your heart and, I suspect agreed by many, including me.
1327883604479930374 2020-11-15 15:58:16 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SeanAKehoe @SaraHaboubi1 Sean, you are right. I thank them personally if I receive a good service, like I thank delivery people, refuse collectors etc.
1327883102321078272 2020-11-15 15:56:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I just wonder, Did the team that helped @BorisJohnson  Gain the Mayoral role in London, twice, the leadership of the Tory Party &amp; the Premiership create a Boris Johnson which has no bearing on the real Boris Johnson? The Question today! who is Boris Johnson?
1327881782293884929 2020-11-15 15:51:02 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @lostmylist True.
1327881488793268225 2020-11-15 15:49:52 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bgir So what is your truth Brian?
1327879864188350465 2020-11-15 15:43:25 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Allegra Stratton (The new daily face of Government) was in tears, THRICE threatened to resign! PM Carrie disagreed with a plan for the future, put to Boris at Chequers by his Senior people, so he binned it. THIS is, in the middle of a lockdown, politics at No.10. BORIS  WAKE UP.
1327864171023708162 2020-11-15 14:41:03 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> A man whose razor sharp political antenna showed was on the Excellent @afneil Weekly political show. Micheal “Choo Choo” Portillo. He would offer a more rounded view and not a blinkered one dimensional view on issues. A good man.
1327863143129821189 2020-11-15 14:36:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @notadoomster Have you ever listened to her. She made a glorious speech in the Lords pointing out to the Lordships their hypocrisy over Brexit and many things. She is a free thinker, on the Moral Maze i first enjoyed her logic on many subjects. A great Brexiteer.
1327707418088837122 2020-11-15 04:18:10 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @WendyPuerto @BorisJohnson Wendy, you have lost trust in everyone lately. You are using far too much black and grey paint. But I respect your view.
1327702373507227649 2020-11-15 03:58:08 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Sheilaw_57 @BorisJohnson Sheila, he was also very strong on our seas and fish, something Johnson has been disgracefully quiet on.
1327697851514806276 2020-11-15 03:40:09 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> After  @BorisJohnson ‘s ridiculous sacking of His two Vote Leave colleagues. Now only Micheal Gove lasts whom Brexiteers trust. We cannot afford this soap opera Gvt. Fiancée deciding policy &amp; whose in and out. Bloody ridiculous. Tis A return of the Brian Rix Westminster Farces.

1327672971171868672 2020-11-15 02:01:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Don’t get me wrong but Arthur Edwards has taken many magnificent photographs of the Royal Family. But why is he the go to for a statement on any Royal? Likewise Paul Burrell is wheeled out whenever Princess Di is discussed.

They wait for the WokeDom to declare then they blindly follow.  Journalism you entered, investigating stories, ensuring facts were backed up then writing it up. Journalists are just readers of twitter, lazy.

1327648407012438016 2020-11-15 00:23:41 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BrianoNazereth good luck in your so necessary work.
1327648238086852614 2020-11-15 00:23:01 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @CUrquhart3  Thank you.
1327643317006458880 2020-11-15 00:03:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @DickRichins Well for the interview wear some trans clothes. How could they refuse you then?
1327643083580780547 2020-11-15 00:02:32 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @davbladesblood Dr. Martin Clutterbuck of the WTO suggests eating comfort food but a bowl of fresh salad, with Pickled onions, eggs, red cabbage. A small 2kg Pork and Egg pie, Ready Salted Crisps, steamed Steak and Kidney puddings with extra thick gravy. Ending with Rice Pudding &amp; Apple Tart.
1327640938961891328 2020-11-14 23:54:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @petuniasforever @BorisJohnson Brilliant Mo, brilliant.
1327612843403960322 2020-11-14 22:02:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @T21Jan Janet, Claire a prominent member of the Brexit Party in the EU. She by the way is a Communist. Both Stuart and Hooey were prominent in the Referendum campaign. Both are trustworthy. But they could provide an alternative viewpoint.
1327608149558366208 2020-11-14 21:43:43 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Jeff48023215 Jeff, I think the programme you are thinking of is Three in a bed?
1327606784681537538 2020-11-14 21:38:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @DickRichins I agree, but it was his choice...or seeing what is happening, perhaps not. What a weak foolish man.
1327606539415392257 2020-11-14 21:37:19 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> If there is a reshuffle let it be dynamic and bring back the big beasts....err....err..Cannot think of any just now give me a few days.
1327606125454352384 2020-11-14 21:35:40 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bashersi Simon, she is the PM. Wake up at the back.
1327605322425503744 2020-11-14 21:32:29 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Again on the cabinet reshuffle. Hancock, if you listen to the people, should be sacked. Keep Gove where he is, to even suggest moving him will create greater trouble. He may resign and the backbenchers will have their PM in waiting.
1327604708681379840 2020-11-14 21:30:02 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Re the proposed Cabinet Reshuffle. Included in a article in which Boris is urged to listen to the people. So here goes. Ridiculous to move M.Gove to The Dept of Health. Again the NHS IS run mainly by women. It need a strong woman...Andrea Ledsom would be brilliant.
1327602867583246337 2020-11-14 21:22:43 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> RE taking over from DC, all I read is MALE names. As the pendulum of power has shifted to women. I believe it needs a strong woman in charge of Boris’s affairs. May I suggest one of Andrea Ledsom MP,  Baroness Claire Fox,  Baroness Kate Hoey,   Baroness Gisela Stuart, Amanda Rudd
1327585977926377474 2020-11-14 20:15:37 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SallyPresto Sally that question must be asked of ALL Conservative MP’s now.  By the way whatever happened to the billions of trees to be planted?

1327583733625532416 2020-11-14 20:06:42 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> IF PM Carrie appoints her former boss, Sajid Javid, into Dom Cummings old job, Tis the end of all those ambitions we voted for. What a mess Boris has created. He should have had strict RED lines between home life and Work. “There are two people sitting on the PM’s chair now”.

1327553478818979841 2020-11-14 18:06:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Annbull64 I do agree Ann. A few people here just want to follow Boris and ignore what he has done. Sacking Cain and Cummings could well prove fateful. Everything comes in three’s! Those of us who are desperate for Brexit must be on guard.

But such, at times, leads to a bigger story emerging. Purchase the DT. BUT the fact is that two loyal people have lost their jobs. THAT &amp; what comes next is the story.
1327548536339259392 2020-11-14 17:46:50 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @swanage123 @GeoffreyDonald7 Why would ‘they’ say that. Linda what do you mean? Along with The Sun, &amp; The Daily Express The DT have been an advocate for Brexit for years. But the story, written by the PolEd, can easily be denied with proof.
1327541030678302721 2020-11-14 17:17:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GeoffreyDonald7 How many times has Boris driven over his red lines on ending the negotiations?  Being a great supporter of our shipping industry, almost killed off by Heath, I am seriously concerned. One prays it is not to be a deal, at any price.
1327539234115379200 2020-11-14 17:09:52 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GeoffreyDonald7 I wrote the DT. They never quote their sources, but they are very reliable.
1327538878098644993 2020-11-14 17:08:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Norm272  I note you write in your bio that you support Free Speech......strange. I am a member of the FSU and it cuts both ways, obviously. I would revaluate your support for freedom of speech and thought.
1327538041842507778 2020-11-14 17:05:08 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I find the alleged revelation in the DT that PM Carrie bombards Boris with texts setting out her opinions on policy 25 times per hour! Truly astounding. No wonder The poor chap looks bewitched, bothered and bewildered.
1327533861379727360 2020-11-14 16:48:31 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Norm272 Norm, you have your view, I have mine. I will continue to say what I think as you continue to fire from behind your barricade. One does not require a “conduit to No.10” as you so vividly described, it is now an open book. I have been against the EU for over 30 years.
1327524521386053632 2020-11-14 16:11:24 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ColinJMorgan @3Heckmonwyke Good for you Colin. The salaries awarded to the staff of this charity is a damned disgrace, not forgetting their financial gift the the Communistic BLM.

1327360331618848768 2020-11-14 05:18:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @vadim59955932 A good title. Now the synopsis please.

1327332379351015428 2020-11-14 03:27:54 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Christmas a festival when Christians relive the birth of Jesus Christ, attend Midnight Mass and sing carols. We used to have Carol Singers come door to door. TODAY we have Major store adverts which bear no link to our festival. Carol singers come who only know, if lucky, one line
1327331263334801411 2020-11-14 03:23:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @kelvmackenzie What is the name of Mr Fox’s agent. I would like to send him a message.
1327329900802560002 2020-11-14 03:18:03 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Sajid David is top of the list for being appointed Chief of Staff, and Guido Fawkes says he wants the job. Now by pure coincidence PM Carrie used to work for him. This is getting rather worrying. How can she be allowed to control our Government?
1327328688908677121 2020-11-14 03:13:14 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Mike_Fabricant Can you remember him, kicked out of a safe Conservative seat. A Remainer as weak as dishwater. A Uriah Heep type character. Goodness I loathed him.
1327326775844745216 2020-11-14 03:05:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I read yesterday that Lord David Frost was very close tO Dominic Cummings. They speculated that he could well resign. I believe Boris, under instructions from PM Carrie, has thrown in the towel with the EU.
1327312992501985281 2020-11-14 02:10:52 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Who will PM Carrie choose as Chief of Staff now? @BorisJohnson has made a monstrous decision. Brexit is now in doubt. I admire and respect people who stand by friends and colleagues. Johnson ditches people or is directed to cull them? Weak man, weakened by this crass decision.
1327236706333028354 2020-11-13 21:07:44 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Sadiq Khan tells how much money he got from Government, &amp;  tells the Met Police they must ensure 40%  of all recruits be from Ethnic Minorities. Nor overlook the fact over 50% of the Met are women. BLAME THE CONSERVATIVES who brought in Elected Mayors and P&amp;CC’s.
1327211208118849538 2020-11-13 19:26:25 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> How many Brexit deadlines has @BorisJohnson ignored. So it will be easy for him to ignore the 1.1.21 deadline. He has a cavalier approach to loyalty and to Brexit. I would like @TiceRichard and @Nigel_Farage to start the opposition to any extension to leaving the EU.

1327143958078689281 2020-11-13 14:59:11 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GowTolson Our system does have its flaws doesn’t it. A politician makes a few popular speeches, appears on the trendy programmes on radio and TV. Then becomes a popular leader of the party. Then becomes PM. And we expect him/her to have all the answers. They have none. They are controlled!
1327139670677975041 2020-11-13 14:42:09 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @theospeek Correct then, correct today. Tomorrow?
1327130989060042759 2020-11-13 14:07:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Conservative MP’s and disloyal cabinet members are being rather stupid, greeting the demise of Dominic Cummings as a good move. They owe their seats to his planning and great support to @BorisJohnson . That many of these people talk to the awful @bbclaura shows they have no sense
1327125836386988035 2020-11-13 13:47:10 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MartinDaubney @milliedrane With the departure of Dominic Cummings a 12month extension of Brexit is very much on the cards. Our Fishing Industry kicked in the teeth again. Remainers will take this as open season for a fresh onslaught against Brexit. “Time for a Re-think” Joe Biden will be all for a re-Union
1327124836955656195 2020-11-13 13:43:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Dominic Cummings is leaving. @BorisJohnson will rue the day. It is the end of cleaning up the Civil Service &amp; the Westminster bog. The moves of Ministries to the North? I doubt it. Boris is turning into David Cameron. Now for a major climb down on Brexit. Boris wants to be loved.

1326941131356172294 2020-11-13 01:33:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> IS Brexit under threat. I think Carrie, our new unelected Prime Minister, does not approve of Brexit. Not long before Dominic Cummings leaves now. @BorisJohnson  has shown such weakness. Controlled by Whitty, Vallance and Hancock. Now PM Carrie steps in.Talks will drift into 2021

1326793837067587586 2020-11-12 15:47:56 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GrahamJ18821678 Let us see. The truth will emerge.

We have given up on our freedoms for which hundreds of thousands of armed services and others gave their lives to protect. Never forget it was a Conservative Gvt aided and abetted by the Labour Party and the lies of Scientists that frightened us all.
1326791777832083456 2020-11-12 15:39:45 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson  YOU say you are ending freedom of movement. You did promise us that ALL ILLEGAL MIGRANTS will be sent back.....is that promise still a valid one...Just asking?
1326791116063182848 2020-11-12 15:37:07 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Did that fool in military garb, who desecrated the Cenotaph on behalf of the Extinction Juveniles, commit any offence against Army legislation whereby pensions could be forfeited?  Just asking.
1326645678882365445 2020-11-12 05:59:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson ‘s fiancée Ms Symonds got him, allegedly, to contribute to a Green Issue. Lee Caine the No10 Director of Communications has resigned, leaving at the end of the year, as it is reported, Ms Symonds was opposed to him becoming the No10 Chief of Staff. WHO runs Britain?

Breathing between words, just ghastly. Sorry. Why not The London Tabernacle Choir?

1326222405367369731 2020-11-11 01:57:16 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @AssetVigilante So the ridiculous situation where a player gets a injury and has to leave the field. He can be replaced but that player cannot bowl or bat. Wrong in so many ways.
1326215146432303105 2020-11-11 01:28:25 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I do think the Cricket Authorities should allow substitutes. If players are having a poor game the ability to change would be good. A batsman holding up play could be replaced.

1326129650985218048 2020-11-10 19:48:41 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> We need a referendum on one Question. Should Former Prime Minister who weakened the UK,by signing Treaties, without seeking the people to agree or not.  Have all honours removed and be barred from involvement, in anyway, in elections.
1326117637852721152 2020-11-10 19:00:57 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I suggest that @Boris Johnson orders EVERY public building from Local Authority HQ, libraries, Schools, Universities, everywhere to fly the Union Flag on 1.1.21 for ever!! People asked to fly the Union Flag outside, from,their homes. Let us set sail with millions of flags.

What a brilliant mind and her speech tearing into the hypocritical Lords who objected to The Brexit Withdrawal Bill was magnificent. She must have greater prominence in Independent UK.

1326043991050231816 2020-11-10 14:08:18 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Sir John Major in yet another bitter anti Brexit speech  said the U.K. was no longer “A great power, and will never be so again” we would “be a top second rank power” THIS man reduced the status of our Country by signing the Maastricht Treaty deserves nothing but our contempt.
1325872113689964544 2020-11-10 02:45:20 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @afneil Not necessarily so. He may have sought advice if he could stand again for a 3rd term.

The Commissioner of Public Appointments and his team must be changed. When you read that STILL the majority of appointments go to Left wing candidates. This must be stopped.

1325709925490810882 2020-11-09 16:00:51 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> We may find the American voting system odd. But we cannot forget that the abuse of our system has been with us with many cases of electoral fraud. Our system for postal voting has been abused. The Electoral Commission must act and look at tighter security at polling stations.

Proud men (mainly in those days) who were loyal to their Country despite having different political views. Yesterday, not a medal in sight. Sad reflection
1325692249359998977 2020-11-09 14:50:37 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The two Speakers of both Houses of Parliament attend the Cenotaph Service of Remembrance on behalf of ALL MP’s and Lords. Why former PM’s leaders of opposition Parties invited? The Prime Minister yes but no others. Politicians a plenty, Two fingers to the Veterans. Time for less.
1325688246773420032 2020-11-09 14:34:42 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Our U turning Prime Minister is worrying me. He must realise that people lose Trust with politicians who show inconsistencies. Trust gone means loss of votes. His attempt to get a deal, has seen UTurns on the date to end the talks.  HE looks desperate. Will he U Turn On fishing?
1325683332953354243 2020-11-09 14:15:11 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Quite laughable that the Foreign Office are seriously concerned that the UK may be down the pecking order on Bidens list of leaders to call and invite to the White House. I hope we just place the ‘Special Relationship’ In the British Museum. I want a proud independent UK
1325682157768077312 2020-11-09 14:10:31 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Tired of my Country being constantly insulted during our Trade talks with the EU, after 40 odd years being the Major contributor, we deserve greater respect. Then along comes Paddy Biden with threats. He must be told to take a jump and told that Obama tried to tell us what to do.

1325379585022828547 2020-11-08 18:08:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @viesvies1 @BorisJohnson What a total hypocrite. For the first time in 100 years under your Prime Ministerial ship. Veterans are BANNED from marching and honouring their colleagues who died for the very freedoms YOU are denying the Veterans and us all.
1325378222939394049 2020-11-08 18:02:47 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Today think of Veterans who have been BANNED attending the Cenotaph Service of Remembrance. For the first time in 100 years are refused the absolute RIGHT to show respect to their fallen comrades. A quite disgraceful decision. Especially for those who may not make it next year.
1325376063531257858 2020-11-08 17:54:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> For eight years I proudly stood by the Cenotaph, having a very small part, in the Service of Remembrance. Driving down on gloomy days which always just before and throughout the dark clouds would allow the Sun to shine through. I cannot remember it ever raining during the Service

NOW, a phone call with Marcus Rashford, a footballer, he has pledged to do what he instructed his party to prevent. Time to call for the men in suits?

1324977116199391232 2020-11-07 15:28:56 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson has made a monstrous decision to call this lockdown on false evidence. He should urgently call it off and return to his tier system, which appeared to be winning. The case for sacking Whitty, Vallance &amp; Hancock is overwhelming. Be sensible. This lockdown is  OTT.

Many people will be hoping that the PM gets a deal BUT not a bad deal. No Deal is far far better than a bad deal. Do not sell out fishing industry, like Heath did! Do not, in anyway tie us to the EU.

Whilst in Britain the Government have a real fight to gain support. As America May change their Leader, we in Blighty May well have to follow.

Women openly told who to vote for and show their votes to the man with them. The Official in charge ignored it and my complaint. So do not lecture me on the safety of the polling booth. Ridiculous.

1324234474570293248 2020-11-05 14:17:56 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Dr.Julian Lewis was sacked by @BorisJohnson  for defying a three line whip. Yesterday over 16 Tory MP’s Defied the three line whip (for which I personally thank them). The PM must be consistent, surely, and either reinstate Dr Lewis or sack those who ‘rebelled’ yesterday.
1324223869310377986 2020-11-05 13:35:47 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Postal Voting has been a scandal in the UK for years. But has anything changed? Why can’t we all vote online, using Security such as finger print or eye scan. Those that do not have the technology can still vote in person.
1324212620480557057 2020-11-05 12:51:06 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Theresa May spoke for millions.

Or call the whole election Null and Void. President Trump stays on as President  until the Senate can arrange a new Election.

1324040224738021381 2020-11-05 01:26:03 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> AS it looks possible, that Donald Trump loses the Presidency.

HE must  Announce NO countrywide lockdown, a return to tiers which appear to work and SACK Gove, Hancock &amp; the two messengers of doom.

1323570573285482498 2020-11-03 18:19:50 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I supported @BorisJohnson for the London Mayor, for the leadership of the Tory Party and for PM because I thought he was a fighter. But I am afraid that due to this sell out over fishing rights he is now damaged goods. No doubt he will dress it up as a win win. Do not believe him
1323569306479792131 2020-11-03 18:14:48 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @borisjohnson  UKIP then The Brexit Party &amp; the majority who voted to Leave the EU in 2016 have suffered four years of delay, false promises and now it appears will still be tied to the EU for at least three more years. We need a strong party with a leader putting the UK1st

But that all fish would have to be paid for. All manner of tough words. The Fishing Industry kicked again. @BorisJohnson has lost the plot and  has lost Many supporters.
1323522834812018690 2020-11-03 15:10:08 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> That @borisjohnson has bent his knee to the EU and surrendered on fishing rights. And the issue put back for three years, with our PM begging that our fishermen/women must now be allowed greater quotas. Surely this demands an urgent question in HofC today? This is not BREXIT.

1323514361932062722 2020-11-03 14:36:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> This article speaks for me. Littlejohn at his best. ⁦@BorisJohnson⁩  Should read this but I suppose his bunker boys will not allow any criticism reach his eyes. MP’s cannot , must not give him Carte Blanche. This IS madness.  https://t.co/m9P6ZbaJ6c
1323493442329206786 2020-11-03 13:13:20 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> ANOTHER U TURN BY @BorisJohnson  in The Sun this morning! Does it read to you as a WIN? It appears, to me, the EU have won as they are deciding the quotas, NOT THE UK.  Putting the full decision off for Three Years is madness.  ARE the EU going to pay the U.K. for their catch?  https://t.co/RvAXLOon2r
1323337219243974656 2020-11-03 02:52:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MadyWaterer @cmackinlay Well done. Wish you well. Take care.

1323320170975236099 2020-11-03 01:44:49 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I salute these Conservative MP’s who are going to vote against Lockdown. Graham Brady Esther McVey Philip Davies Charles Walker Desmond Swayne John Redwood Robert Syms Andrew Rosindell William Wragg Chris Green Mike Penning  Marcus Fysh  Richard Drax. Is your MP here?
1323315059486064640 2020-11-03 01:24:30 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @kelvmackenzie When @BorisJohnson turned down that and other reasonable requests. He came across as a middle manager who cannot make decisions. Saturday, the end, David Wooding asked if Premiership could go ahead. BJ said “Undoubtably” then glanced at the two doomsayers. They control him.
1323287937690357767 2020-11-02 23:36:44 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @LordBarnbrook In our day, though I had the greatest of respect for their role and dedication, To read Women Police account for over 50% of officers. This, no doubt, will be the direction of the Armed Services. Also, back then your family HAD to be British &amp; you had to apply to get married.
1323240334260867072 2020-11-02 20:27:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Never forget that Gove heads the Brexit EU negotiations. He wants to weaken @BorisJohnson so the proposal on fishing will have come from him.
1323239916269117440 2020-11-02 20:25:55 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @AndrewRosindell @vickylittlewood Well said Mr Rosindell. To rely on an inner cabal of scientists and the Sage scientists looking in one direction. Their forecasts have ALL been wrong. SAGE should be disbanded. Boris must sack Gove &amp; Hancock. We Carry on with our lives, looking after the elderly. Enough is Enough

Arrested yesterday by a gang of police officers at Speakers Corner. The way he is being harassed (a criminal offence) by the Police is seriously disturbing. I do not share his political views.
1323178108317540352 2020-11-02 16:20:19 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SteveLaws_ @HappilyUnwoke But, I read he was NOT speaking out.
1323176572556398593 2020-11-02 16:14:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> An ode for Prime Minister @BorisJohnson   They said it was the job ‘That could not be done’ So he wanted the job ‘That could not be done’ He got the job ‘That could not be done’ He rolled up his sleeves to tackle the job ‘That could not be done. But found he could not do it!!

1323173474119176201 2020-11-02 16:01:54 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Bill4Brexit The time has come for the BBC to be renamed. TBABB. Totally Biased Against Britain Broadcasting. The new DG @TonyHallBBCDG has found the job far to big for him to handle. To ignore Remembrance Day respect by Football teams for the ridiculous ‘taking the knee’ is a damned disgrace
1323170425782915074 2020-11-02 15:49:47 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @kelvmackenzie Farage for PM?
1323170198766161920 2020-11-02 15:48:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @pennyone Will @BorisJohnson ever say this? You can bet your life he won’t.

1323152549894041600 2020-11-02 14:38:45 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn John. Sadly I did not hear Roy Keane’s diatribe against the team, after the match. Olly should invite Keane into the dressing room. I just cannot see any of the present Management team doing what is really needed. He could do worse by employing Keane as Adviser on team affairs.
1323149462169112578 2020-11-02 14:26:29 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Former Minister, Steve Baker MP, having attended a meeting at No. 10, of why a lockdown is necessary ‘to save the NHS’ he came out saying he would support the lockdown. Now many Conservative MP’s are against it. Baker is now ‘considering his position’ He is a maybe /never man.
1323144269616582657 2020-11-02 14:05:51 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @IsabelOakeshott She would be a great capture for your new party.
1323140614066720768 2020-11-02 13:51:19 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ifneedsmust Robert, of course you are right. My concern is that this will be put across as a win win? If they fish they must pay for those catches.
1323140102705524736 2020-11-02 13:49:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @IsabelOakeshott If the report I read last night is correct, that Fishing is going to be kicked into the long grass and EU boats allowed to continue. So Boris can do a Chamberlain wave a paper “We have a deal”. That will be a kicking for our Fishing Industry again. UKIP/Brexit Party have warned.
1323138787090812929 2020-11-02 13:44:04 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @IsabelOakeshott Hopefully this revitalised party takes politics by the scruff of its neck. The total waste of taxpayers money, the reliance on a cabal of “experts” ignoring others with opposing views. Calling for the sacking of Gove and Hancock, Say the cabinet is a group of weak nodding donkeys
1323136598771458050 2020-11-02 13:35:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Jacob Rees-Mogg said in Parliament that MP’s were “essential workers” and as such are bound to attend PArliament to properly represent their constituents. THIS WEEK more than ever Parliament MUST hold this Government to account on Lockdown. Demanding answers.
1323135246242586624 2020-11-02 13:30:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @TiceRichard  Richard, May I suggest, with your new rebranded party, your policy on Police and Crime Commissioners is SCRAP them. Put Chief Constables / Commissioners back in charge reporting directly to the Home Secretary. Or even follow Police Scotland by having Police England?
1323132044021506049 2020-11-02 13:17:16 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @LordBarnbrook @metpoliceuk Micheal, Me too. Goodness there is a real lack of leadership. I like to believe that Constables to Chief Inspectors want to do the job of policing properly, but the Conservative idea of elected Mayors / P&amp;CC  has, in the case of London, proved to be an absolute disaster.
1323020153622319104 2020-11-02 05:52:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @KEdge23 @christopherhope Kevin, if the news tonight, That they are going to kick the issue of the EU fishing in our water into the long grass to get a deal done, if correct The Reform Party will well and truly take off. That sell out will never be forgiven.
1323015763461103620 2020-11-02 05:35:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @T45Mark @BorisJohnson Indeed.
1323015457809551365 2020-11-02 05:34:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @T45Mark @BorisJohnson Well I fundamentally disagree.

1323014388530466824 2020-11-02 05:29:45 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @T45Mark @BorisJohnson That is why the water has chlorine put in.
1323013708709351429 2020-11-02 05:27:03 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @nickgutteridge @Sunpoches @IanWishart Fishing Industry sell out. For Long Grass read they can fish with impunity.
1323013472272211968 2020-11-02 05:26:06 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @nickgutteridge @Sunpoches @IanWishart That is not BREXIT . This goes against the red lines painted by @BorisJohnson, interesting that Lord Frost has not said anything for weeks. Prime Minister this will be a total deceit on the British People. We do not breed strong Prime Ministers able to speak up for the UK anymore
1323011651759755264 2020-11-02 05:18:52 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn Yes, the good news is that you will live to see Manchester United win this season.
1323009890068107267 2020-11-02 05:11:52 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson  I cannot understand why sporting pursuits, golf, tennis, swimming, anything really which allows people to enjoy fresh air and helping in their personal fitness. If these are banned WHY is premiership football/rugby etc allowed?
1323007946398322692 2020-11-02 05:04:09 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @HHepplewhite Well they are disgusting, self serving morons. They should all be sacked.
1322995189498208256 2020-11-02 04:13:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Just turned on BBC2 for top  https://t.co/rdyeLE9Hh7 time to see Jacki Smith given the boot. But the set and the whole thing gave the impression of the ‘End of the Pier Show’. It is on its last legs. A new ballroom dancing show featuring BRITISH DANCERS &amp; British Judges is RQD.
1322986251843153923 2020-11-02 03:37:56 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Perhaps @skysports can answer me this. Why can Viewersbin Australia get all Sky-games on Optus Sport including Box Office games, like Spurs this evening?
1322966397807460352 2020-11-02 02:19:03 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn He was substituted!
1322965119295459336 2020-11-02 02:13:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn Very sad news indeed. Great player.
1322964276659867651 2020-11-02 02:10:37 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ArtedLight @AngelaPower7 The question should be WHO would you like to be Prime Minister?
1322963418488463367 2020-11-02 02:07:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn Can Pogba play in goal? He is totally in the wrong piece of the jigsaw to me. I would have pulled him. They are missing a captain, a leader Maguire is neither.
1322962221589241858 2020-11-02 02:02:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @VickiPMcKellar I certainly agree it looks like that.
1322961699822075909 2020-11-02 02:00:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @VickiPMcKellar Well said Vicki, not about at the French Embassy where they? Sat in vans!
1322952074657779713 2020-11-02 01:22:08 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn It is a disjointed side today.
1322932907875459073 2020-11-02 00:05:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn Indeed it is!

1322886708241833984 2020-11-01 21:02:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GeoffreyDonald7 @BorisJohnson you are acting  “Holier than the rest”  I think of the people who could lose their jobs, the elderly! whose are now banned from seeing grandkids.The country broke. A mess which could and should have been avoided and the virus ignored, like the flu virus, which has killed far more
1322883815568756736 2020-11-01 20:50:54 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GeoffreyDonald7 But, I did everything you mentioned, plus stay indoors mostly since March. So tell me why I should not criticise @BorisJohnson and then tell me what makes you so holier than all the rest?

1322808941286465536 2020-11-01 15:53:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> On Jacob Rees Mogg, my apologies . The great man did say that MP’s by their very nature ARE essential workers and should therefore attend in person. (Westminster Hall could easily be adapted to allow for spacing).
1322806242927136768 2020-11-01 15:42:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MeadowsLord Good point, well made.
1322806018741555202 2020-11-01 15:41:46 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Jacob Rees Mogg MP answering a question on why MP’s should ALL attend debates in the House of Commons pointed out that it was the lawful duty of MP’s to attend in person. They must ALL attend this coming Wednesday. They must stop this Gang of Four ruining the Country.
1322804919359967232 2020-11-01 15:37:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> “I suppose”is now a definitive. As is ‘Might be’ , ‘Could be’ etc.  Fairness is a Committee of Four,  three of whom Are slaves ‘to the science’ ‘to save the NHS’ One is not! Rishi Sunak The Chancellor of the Exchequer speaks for millions. The PM is in a very vulnerable position.
1322802689403736065 2020-11-01 15:28:32 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I suggested weeks ago that @BorisJohnson got together with the Scientists and others who have put cogent and a well argued view to look into alternatives. HE has failed to even consider that, to have an open mind, to really understand the great damage lockdowns etc do to the UK .
1322801619541598208 2020-11-01 15:24:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> A total farce. DID you see the very distressed lady at her greengrocers shop in Great Torrington, Devon. The lady’s tears were genuine and she wept for ALL small businesses. We have a cabal of four ruining this Country. ALL MP’s MUST Attend in person this Wednesday’s debate.
1322661980738650114 2020-11-01 06:09:24 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spinnerjohn John, Will a box of Monopoly Money do?
1322642059023523841 2020-11-01 04:50:15 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @robynegee Why, Robyne, why?
1322626830508138497 2020-11-01 03:49:44 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Lockdown back. Based on supposition/theories which proved incorrect before. The same threat the NHS would fail to cope, yet  Nightingale Hospitals hardly used.  The Sun asked if the Premier League was safe, BJ said categorically yes but glanced at scientists. He is NOT in charge!
1322620986257190915 2020-11-01 03:26:30 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @truemagic68 And the cabinet agreed this course of action? Goodness what foolish people. Frit. I hope this gets thrown out by Parliament. I noted Sweden was not mentioned. Totally scare tactics. Boris has made a major mistake. Did you notice, this time, he never mentioned “places of worship”
1322619587788234758 2020-11-01 03:20:57 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @truemagic68 David, what concerns, especially from Vallance’s evidence. “Might” “Could be” “Perhaps”. They are just putting the finger in the air. I am more sceptical than ever.
1322608908490473472 2020-11-01 02:38:31 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @oflynnsocial I can see resignations.
1322608245178011648 2020-11-01 02:35:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson has form for keeping the public waiting. Today is was well advertised for 4pm, then 5pm, then 6.30pm. Which suggests confusion and flapping in Number 10. Are we going to see resignations? Something has upset the Apple cart. Showing contempt to the people is Bad.

1322547112551321602 2020-10-31 22:32:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> If @BorisJohnson calls another lockdown, after promising he wouldn’t, what is next? Fishing climb down to get a Brexit deal? Will he now face a challenge for the leadership? The report that serious polls in Scotland (DT) suggest they HATE him and will lead to a break up of the UK
1322541716256206849 2020-10-31 22:11:31 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @delboy993 @BorisJohnson It surely does.
1322525667905458177 2020-10-31 21:07:45 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @djc547 @BorisJohnson Well said David. We were sold a pup at the General Election. Not even told, by him, he was a Globalist, and what that meant. I supported him, wanted him to succeed. But sorry to say, I feel I was duped.

1322523841831280643 2020-10-31 21:00:29 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> When, at 4pm, @BorisJohnson comes to the Rostrum. He must do it alone. No propaganda from the ‘experts’. But the PM MUST in banning groups etc this time address events like yesterday where Muslims ignored the Covid rules. They must Be held to account. When in Rome etc.

An enactment is enhanced by good actors. BBC2 had a compilation of Dickens which had Black actors, the recent David Copperfield film is excellent.

The Tory Party brought in these ever so powerful Mayors. I believe firmly the PM of the UK has responsibility for what happens in our capital.

As Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are under the scourge of Devolution? What does PM do?
1322080984678936577 2020-10-30 15:40:44 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @LSadler16861851 Linda he often talks about his Muslim Great Grandfather, who was Turkish. Could he be looking at the Modern Muslims through rose tinted spectacles and ignoring the evidence.
1322077405935226880 2020-10-30 15:26:31 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Listening to Times Radio earlier they were talking about the Orsen Welles Radio play of War of the Worlds, which caused many terrified Americans to drive into the hills. TR had a guest from America on who simply did not know what he was talking about.
1322076417157435392 2020-10-30 15:22:35 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The Prime Minister has said he stands with the French over the ghastly murders yesterday. That so has he done anything to STOP the proposed march on the French Embassy by Muslims in London today? This should not be allowed to continue. £10.000 fines for all attending?

That could be construed as Treason.

1321151490942271488 2020-10-28 02:07:15 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @afneil I asked WHO is advising Boris Johnson? YET another own goal, another fine mess he has been placed in. I agree this monstrous fee and if one totalled up the monies paid for all  “advisors” that could easily pay for free school meals for all,  all year.  @BorisJohnson  Kick arse.
1321148830604087296 2020-10-28 01:56:41 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @JohnCaveAusten I really miss the Little Chef All Day English Breakfast.

1321003449740386305 2020-10-27 16:19:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @cwsmith1 Perhaps @TonyHallBBCDG could answer that Q for you.
1320994103748927495 2020-10-27 15:41:51 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @imsitservian @EverywhereInOne @10DowningStreet @BorisJohnson Ian, we are supposed to be free from 1.1.21. You tell me we are tied on this until 2023. We are then saying that the EU can decide what weapons we use! What fighter planes we use! This is not a free society. If you are happy with that so be it. BUT I am not.
1320990364640137216 2020-10-27 15:27:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MickGreenhough @MigrationWatch Mick, how can France, Germany and other countries throw out undesirables whilst in the EU.? But the real question must be WILL on 1.1.21 The UK be free from the EU? Or is @BorisJohnson keeping the door ajar to rejoin?
1320988793009283073 2020-10-27 15:20:45 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MigrationWatch @MickGreenhough Come on now. WHO trusts Priti Patel to throw these criminals out?
1320987642503319557 2020-10-27 15:16:11 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @EverywhereInOne @10DowningStreet @BorisJohnson How many knew of this betrayal? No doubt we will be part of the EU Army. Are we IN or OUT @BorisJohnson  YOU are now on that slippery slope.
1320987086934204416 2020-10-27 15:13:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @StmCh_ @rentonMagaUK Quite brilliant. And so true. Trump has and will continue to make the USA great again. Here in my beloved Britain. We await a leader who will make Great Britain again. We need a Trump.
1320985282829758465 2020-10-27 15:06:48 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @tricia713 BUT, Will we gat it?
1320985098729172992 2020-10-27 15:06:04 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> RECALL the promises on BBC TV Licenses, Immigration, The Lords, Even Brexit. What dynamic plans have been laid down? Too difficult to remove the threat of imprisonment on BBC license, THE Laws on immigration too difficult, Appoint more Lords, Stand by for a Brexit BAD DEAL.
1320983452125192194 2020-10-27 14:59:32 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson proved by appointing more people to the Lords recently that he has NO PLANS to end this unelected chamber and create a fully elected Assembly. Ensuring that former MP’s cannot stand for election to this forum. Assembly Members would be regional representatives.
1320981393950855170 2020-10-27 14:51:21 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Drayford ignored calls to scrap Supermarket restrictions. Gething, Welsh Health Minister, now says Supermarkets use discretion &amp; sell to those in “genuine need” HE broke COVID-19 restrictions and also pronounced that ‘Hen Nights’ should be banned. Labour love bossing us about.
1320975048631603200 2020-10-27 14:26:08 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Football players have proved, by ‘taking the knee’ in their carefully choreographed positioning and down as one when the whistle is blown, they can can kneel alone. Very interested how they are going to deal with Remembrance Day?  What comes first. BLM or the Poppy.

1320636864072736768 2020-10-26 16:02:19 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Why did this photograph make me instantly think of Matt Hancock?  @truemagic68 @spcb @BorisJohnson  https://t.co/JCdwrW9MuJ
1320635570259959808 2020-10-26 15:57:10 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Can I ask just WHO is advising @BorisJohnson ? Far too many own goals at the minute. Call a halt on the negativity, time to bring hope and joy back to the Nation. Just ASK people to look after themselves and think of others. End the restrictions today. END DEVOLVEMENT. ONE UK.

1320376251350196224 2020-10-25 22:46:44 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @wilkinson1ps Wrexham to Barnsley 87 miles (to Cardiff 139miles)  Wrexham must join the Northern Powerhouse. Bring jobs to North Wales.
1320374852184870912 2020-10-25 22:41:10 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> What IF the conspiracy theory relating to Bill Gates, Vaccination for all the world, collapse of economies, countries conspiring against their own people was True? What wil we do and WHO do we turn to ?
1320368511781392390 2020-10-25 22:15:59 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The hub Cities of Liverpool/Manchester/Leeds&amp; Sheffield have everything North Wales needs. ‘The Northern Powerhouse’ Wrexham should lead the way by joining them. (Cardiff. 139miles). Leeds 96. Liverpool 41. Manchester 54. Sheffield 91 miles. Preston 69. Makes sense.
1320347773154299909 2020-10-25 20:53:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Is the BBC News in particular, still irrationally anti Donald Trump? Have ANY of the Socialist anti capitalist (champagne socialists ) left our screens? Has @LauraKuensberg  changed her anti Brexit, Boris etc. Rants as yet?  Has @TonyHallBBCDG  made any difference whatsoever?

1320294279298928640 2020-10-25 17:21:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> “Do not resuscitate” is, surely, totally against the Hippocratic Oath? My father in law was scared witless,whilst in hospital during the first part of the Virus, heard two nurses telling a patient in the next bed that they would NOT resuscitate. FiL was terrified.

1320263339700793344 2020-10-25 15:18:04 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson Should end Devolution if he wants a United Kingdom or consider a system like the USA. Four Federal States, a system of government in which the states form a unity but remain independent in internal affairs. With an elected President/ or Monarchy.
1320261221845733376 2020-10-25 15:09:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I honestly thought, once elected and back in Numberv10 with a large majority,@BorisJohnson would tear up the Withdrawal Agreement. But no he endorses it! He should tear it up today because the EU will make sure we stand by every dot and comma.
1320260137152663554 2020-10-25 15:05:20 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Exp_Sec_Prof @WendyPuerto May is a disgrace. WHY the Conservative Party allowed her to stand for Parliament again confuses me. Why she has not had the Whip removed amazes me. The Conservative Party need to wake up quickly.
1320254716870299648 2020-10-25 14:43:48 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson  I copy a tweet. “WHY Cannot ‘Children in Need’ step in and pay for School Meals for Starving Children”? BUT I want The Government who pay ‘consultants’ thousands and waste millions, to turn the clock back &amp; provide FREE school meals for ALL pupils.

1319996137294757893 2020-10-24 21:36:18 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> In the 60’s / 70’s Police Women controlled all problem families in their Sub Division. They knew every problem family. Now in more enlightened times. Where Social Workers have proven, time and again, wanting in so many cases. Child Protection must be restored to the Police.
1319993318646947842 2020-10-24 21:25:06 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> THE Government MUST demand Police investigate ALL allegations of children not being fed. This is cruelty and The Children and Young People’s Act is the legislation for them to act. ALL Children MUST be taken into care in EVERY case.

1319912115088535552 2020-10-24 16:02:25 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The BIG BREXIT GAMESHOW.... You could win a Free Trade Agreement or walk away empty, but proud. See who stands up to promises made to their people and who does not? Will you be watching?
1319907452465434626 2020-10-24 15:43:54 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Just remember that all these £Trillions spent on the Chinese Virus (Notice only @realDonaldTrump calls it for what it is) is borrowed money which our children / grandchildren will be paying back. IT IS OUR MONEY they have filtered away. Look at the salaries and pay offs! Obscene.
1319906056705921025 2020-10-24 15:38:21 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MarkDrakeford I note that Swansea City FC travel to Bristol today, Middlesbrough FC to Cardiff, Newport FC to Bradford, Barnet FC to Wrexham. HOW and WHY are you allowing Welsh teams to play football when they should all be in lockdown in their homes? The people cannot attend!
1319903108957376512 2020-10-24 15:26:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Just a Question. IS Sir Mark Sedwell, once our top man in Security of our State, being charged with a breach of the Official Secrets Act by telling on our work keeping Russia and China at bay?
1319885192107069440 2020-10-24 14:15:26 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I never thought I would say this. I would prefer Macron to be in charge here. The passion he shows for France is something NOT ONE of our elected politicians show for England, Wales, Northern Ireland or Scotland. @BorisJohnson sits and watches whilst devolution kills off the UK!
1319883723203117056 2020-10-24 14:09:36 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bobscartoons @3Heckmonwyke @BorisJohnson  “Proper Honour” banning the right of Veterans to proudly wear their medals and march with friends and colleagues past the Cenotaph to honour the fallen. It is insulting to them and the British people that you have not spoken against the first time ever cancellation

1319880208158232576 2020-10-24 13:55:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @PaulMer53 @Memyselfandvan In the 50’s/60’s both Conservative and Labour benches were filled with people who has served their country, with distinction, in the Army during the War. One MP who loved our Country and would have made a brilliant PM was Enoch Powell.
1319878193004896257 2020-10-24 13:47:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Total silence from @BorisJohnson over The Cenotaph Service of Remembrance being cancelled FOR veterans WHO FOUGHT for freedom. Represented by politicians, who have NOT served in any of the Armed Services is a total sham. What if Veterans just turned up to honour the fallen?

1319874100702203905 2020-10-24 13:31:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson Police stop people driving from England into Wales. Police turn back those leaving Wales into England. Police Scotland will copy. Supermarkets banned from selling unessential goods. cameras repositioned to spy on pedestrians! People WILL revolt!  Under your watch.

This is overbearing and totally out of order. Someone should resign. OR order a uniform because we are now in a bloody police state

1319638124901924864 2020-10-23 21:53:41 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson a whisper in your ear. This cannot go on forever. We have a vaccine for flu, we take it every year. But people still die from flu. We are not immortal, We all die. Let us live whilst we are alive, Boris, Let us live IN spite of the virus.

IT IS about Sovereignty, it is about Our Country and pride and any watering down on @BorisJohnson ‘s commitment on fishing will be seen as a sell out. YES arrange quotas WE ARRANGE NOT THE EU! They pay UK for fishing. I did see the EU/CBI/&amp; Co. behind this.

1319535437933875200 2020-10-23 15:05:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> ODD that the newspaper that fought for Brexit/ Fishing Industry, has a Save the City article Citing the fishing industry as 0.1%.  what was the % before Heath killed it off?

1319166500717142016 2020-10-22 14:39:37 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Has @BorisJohnson told Lord Frost and @michealgovemp “don’t come back without a deal”. Well I do not believe I will be alone in wanting to see the full details of any deal published. The DEVIL is in the detail. I am beginning to fear the worst again. Hope I am wrong.

1319163679976423426 2020-10-22 14:28:24 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Lord Frost &amp; Boris caved in following a  speech in which Barnier said the EU must accept that the UK will be an independent nation and both sides must begin “compromising”! Then said settled quotas on fishing.(Set by them?) Boris be very careful. NO deal is better than a BAD DEAL

Chief Whip needs to sack HER NOT Mr Rosindell who you sacked for not voting for COVID. After supporting you so much. Bad move.

1318861185664618496 2020-10-21 18:26:24 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Six PMQ questions from The Leader of the Opposition is far too many. Two for the SNP is far too many. IF the other party leaders are limited to One Question surely that must be the same for all. The Labour MP’s just reiterate what Starmer said, as the SNP mirror their man. Cut it

1318417724121427968 2020-10-20 13:04:15 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Years ago, in another life, a young Nurse asked me to read her dissertation. It concluded after excellent research that Smoking would be a good treatment for Parkinson’s Disease. I submitted to London. But at the time banning smoking was uppermost in priority.

1318413048164589571 2020-10-20 12:45:40 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The Chief Whip, Mark Spencer, must tell Mrs May that she was a disaster as PM. Her behaviour yesterday was out of order Attempting to undermine Micheal Gove. She has taken over, from Heath, as the great sulk. IF she cannot support the government she must consider her position.
1318394823695622153 2020-10-20 11:33:15 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Rob_Kimbell Well said Robert. Mind you I thought Gove’s ever so polite retort was brilliant. “I agree with you, No deal is better than a bad deal”

Deportation with British Citizenship revoked and passports removed. The Home Secretary must have the right by law to order the deportation of any migrant who breaks the law.

1318216509915791363 2020-10-19 23:44:41 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Macron should be declared a terrorist and a Warrant for his arrest issued. Making threats to the British People, (who with the Americans saved them from the Nazis). Is childish. WHY no condemnation from @BorisJohnson or  @realDonaldTrump ? This, surely, must mean NO DEAL.
1318205221529669632 2020-10-19 22:59:50 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @The_Fogeys @BorisJohnson IF, at the end of all this, there is a deal. WE maintaining control of our seas and fish, having sustainable agreements with France, for which they must pay. Do not EVER invite Macron and the other ‘leaders’ , who tried to kick us constantly, on a State Visit.

1318170205097439232 2020-10-19 20:40:41 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Can Mr Drayford @WelshAssembly_  publish the Evidence that made him make the statement that THEY KNOW  a lockdown Will slow down Covid19. A very important question especially as he and other have demanded the Evidence from the UK Government. We await.
1318168662180769792 2020-10-19 20:34:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The @WelshAssembly..  must have had Mystic Meg sitting with them. Mr Drayford tells we in Wales that “WE KNOW” that a short lockdown “WILL” slow down the number of infections. (Note: Not STOP the virus,just slow down) Just another Labour ploy to embarrass the real UK Government.

We are fragmenting as a United Kingdom. Now Boris may like Devolvement &amp; more power for Mayors. BUT, not in your manifesto. Kill Devolvement &amp; let the U.K. GVT. Govern.
1318142144348065792 2020-10-19 18:49:11 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @LordBarnbrook Indeed. A very thoughtful, kind, even Christian observation to all Tottenham Hotspur fans. You must be a Chelsea supporter.

1317756120740646912 2020-10-18 17:15:16 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The BANNING of veterans to march, with friends and colleagues, proudly wearing their medals, passing the Cenotaph to honour the fallen, is a decision which has to be carefully watched. I believe some Establishment figures want this annual service brought to an end.
1317754418700365824 2020-10-18 17:08:30 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Whilst the message of Christmas celebrated by Christians, (a reminder UK is a Christian land), The birth of Jesus has been lost. Here we have a Union Chief saying we have a ‘perverse obsession’ ! This will be pushed Mark my words.  https://t.co/7UM7AYWIKf
1317752817495539712 2020-10-18 17:02:09 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I noticed that Andy Burnham had no makeup on this morning. Still looking to be the Leader of the Labour Party. Chosen the wrong battlefield.

1317544035087716354 2020-10-18 03:12:31 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BarbuUn The arrogance of the EU. They think we need them. They need us far more. The French sell us more than we sell them, likewise Germany etc. There will be a deal. Macron will get his Fisherman on our seasBUT They will have to pay for the privilege. Fish landed at our ports.

1317485801240993797 2020-10-17 23:21:07 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @TonyHallBBCDG  one hopes the Marr Show THIS Sunday Morning will be checked so that any Anti Brexit guest gets the same time as the Pro Brexit guest. Would hate the BBC to be attacked for flying the flag for the EU.

1317442711423799298 2020-10-17 20:29:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ChristineEasda1 Christine, I was apologising because he proved me wrong. If it is just game play he has played a very good hand. Boris has gained the upper hand. IF the EU act in their belligerent manner, we move to No Deal. But with Mrs Merkel calling for a good deal for both, Boris has won.

1317369576657735680 2020-10-17 15:39:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> DO ALL the membership of the CBI, especially the “Non Members”accept the anti Government pro EU rhetoric from the CBI? If you reading this, and a member of any of these organisations you should ask them that Question.  How can any public body be allowed to be part of this org?
1317364966182293504 2020-10-17 15:20:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> It would be refreshing to read of some, if not all, members of the CBI. To announce they have resigned as they cannot agree with the constant government bashing.
1317364289221611521 2020-10-17 15:18:16 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @philiprichards5 Love that, Philip.

1317341448451346432 2020-10-17 13:47:30 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MattSmithWales @Cragggssyy The way they cosy up to the fourth rate politicians makes me laugh. But there again the whole set up of both the BBC and ITN local news is so cosy, very twee and almost like a soap opera. But their reports are very shallow.
1317333486240399360 2020-10-17 13:15:52 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @katiemelua Sorry to read of Your divorce. A quite brilliant song writer and singer. I find every song so emotive. I wish you well and more success.
1317327242268184577 2020-10-17 12:51:03 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @HHepplewhite @DavidGHFrost Lord Frost please. He is definitely a great BRIT. It has highlighted the real weakness of Heath, Wilson, Callaghan, Thatcher, Major, Blair, Brown, Cameron and May ALL kept us in the EU. Only Thatcher tried to fight them but was knifed. Shame on them ALL. Onwards and Upwards.
1317325060911337474 2020-10-17 12:42:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Am I the only one sick and tired of the CBI mouthing off, at every opportunity, against the British Government? They receive financial support from the EU, as do the BBC. And any statement from these two organisations should declare a financial interest. Proscribe the Anti UK CBI
1317324262630477824 2020-10-17 12:39:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> What I admired of the French politicians yesterday, after the ghastly beheading of the teacher, from Macron down they called it Islamic Terrorism. The difference between the French and British establishment way of trying to minimise every attack on us.
1317320904070803456 2020-10-17 12:25:52 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The BBC’s reporting of @BorisJohnson ending trade talks was biased in favour of the EU.. This has to end. Its political bias has to end. Impartiality must be it’s cornerstone. It needs a complete new structure. A Royal Commission on the future of the BBC is the best way forward.
1317301607890124800 2020-10-17 11:09:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I cannot believe that George Osborne is in the running to become the BBC Chairman. The man who will inherit a Baronetcy is a member of the establishment. He cannot be trusted to bring in the changes desperately needed in the BBC. A case of No George No! Rod Liddle is the man.
1317208011094609920 2020-10-17 04:57:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Well he did what he said he would do. I honestly believed he would buckle. He didn’t and our Prime Minister @BorisJohnson  Deserves my apology and also praise from every Brexiteer. The EU have shown they are a bunch of conniving vagabonds. Keep to your guns PM. Congratulations.
1317194740400607237 2020-10-17 04:04:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @AppelbeWootton My respect to you Jonathon. I salute you.

1317131112783761408 2020-10-16 23:51:43 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> That wide boy Andy Burnham, the man who would be King, but nobody wanted him. Has had his fortune read. The United Kingdom Government can step in at anytime. It can be declared a National Problem and Messrs Drayford, Sturgeon and Foster should sit up.
1317129936197554177 2020-10-16 23:47:02 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @JHA111316 I note “some” not exactly a commendation? But, come on, there are good and bad everywhere. My ire is directed at the fourth rate politicians running the Welsh Assembly. Never forgetting that, as I live in Wales, we have to pay for them. End Devolution.

They are treating you as a Patsy. Tell them to forget coming here next week. Enough.
1317081993658642434 2020-10-16 20:36:32 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Bull_Spotter Yes, in a gentle loving manner.
1317081843800395776 2020-10-16 20:35:56 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @VinceLe79180734 I know. But we need a laugh. Let’s face it Plaid Cymru are revolting and Mark Drayford has to be the worst “leader”!?!? In politics anywhere. He should consider the consequences if the English decided not to visit Wales at all

Many deaths, great many losing limbs. Our Islands raided men, women and children taken into slavery. Do not lecture us on White Privilege.
1316963367358169088 2020-10-16 12:45:09 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson  do not fall for the plea from Angela Merkel. She is no friend of the UK. EU Leaders do not believe you will break off the talks and tear up the Working Agreement. As I say, NO DEAL Stop all Covid lockdowns. We need all back in their jobs. Ready for Take Off.
1316848271369920518 2020-10-16 05:07:48 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> That chancer Andy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester has lots of experience of making people’s lives a bloody misery. Ask him about Stafford/Stoke hospitals. The man is a charlatan. Interviewed today in his Lenin man of the people garb, political opportunism at its worst.

We will succeed.  Forget about lockdowns. You need young fit people to prepare. Just request the elderly to stay safe. Ban EU Cars.

1316626008666189831 2020-10-15 14:24:36 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> PMQ’s yesterday. Not one question on the cancellation of the National Cenotaph Service of Remembrance. “We will remember them” Now “WHO will remember them?” Will the Service be cancelled forever now?
1316623556348870656 2020-10-15 14:14:52 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @robert_sympson A very serious Establishment Scandal. One which cannot be brushed under the carpet. Criminal Offences have been committed and they must go to a Criminal Court. The Home Office are Complicit by not publishing it. Was This decision agreed by @PritiPatelMP1  and  @BorisJohnson
1316617611095019520 2020-10-15 13:51:14 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson  @10DowningStreet  I read some time ago that Dominic Cummings will leave Number 10 when Brexit is fulfilled. If that is the case I can think of no finer man to be appointed Chairman of the BBC.

1316613845943812096 2020-10-15 13:36:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> As many expected another red line date will be ignored by @BorisJohnson over the EU trade talks. Barnier has been proved right. “He has made broken two fixed dates to move to No Deal, he will again” Sad to see! Boris is being played.I hope he reads the DM editorial.  https://t.co/kZVp3Ktl0c
1316612425618264064 2020-10-15 13:30:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> WHO disagrees withProfessor Dalgleish? Matt Hancock has to be replaced. @BorisJohnson The Country needs a Health Secretary who is Objective and not Subjective. He is not part of the problem. He IS the problem.  https://t.co/s3gIr8TK6z
1316611333270507521 2020-10-15 13:26:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Oliver Dowden stalls on decriminalising the BBC Licence fee. “There are major challenges around decriminalisation” So if he does not want it to become a civil offence HE must SCRAP the licence fee. The BBC must become a subscription only service. Dowden is a major disappointment.

1316432440932564992 2020-10-15 01:35:26 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> It is right Parliament discusses racism in any forms BUT why NO debate on the shocking and disgusting rapes and serious sexual offences of Under aged white girls by mainly Pakistani Gangs. WHEN will the Home Office release the unexpurgated report into these rapes? @BorisJohnson
1316424836001001478 2020-10-15 01:05:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @JohnCaveAusten I disagree with you. “Misguided” is a rather soft description for Murder.

1316274707625390080 2020-10-14 15:08:40 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I am not against abortion but believe there must be safeguards. Do not support abortion as another Method of birth control. How can we entertain having a trade agreement with New Zealand who have allowed just made law abortion at any stage of the pregnancy including the birth.

1316226919847940096 2020-10-14 11:58:46 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson  MUST be congratulated. It appears he Is moving away from the the Gloomy two and SAGE. Perhaps he will now invite other scientists etc in to give him alternative views. AND he will not budge over negotiations with the EU. No Deal Is on the cards. I praise him.

Just do a little research and you will be much the wiser. Sexual exploitation o children by priests goes back to the Middle Ages. Come back when you have wised up.
1316069240118620160 2020-10-14 01:32:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Barnier is correct.3 times Boris threatened the UK would walk away. Twice backed off. So they expect him to do it again this Week. Barnier convinced fishing is used by Boris to get a good deal. Boris spoke to Macron last weekend. Trade off on the cards? Can WE trust @BorisJohnson

1315902675775631360 2020-10-13 14:30:20 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Will the Prime Minister be asked by any MO at PMQ’s tomorrow.   1. Will you ensure that the National Cenotaph Service takes place this year?  2. As first Lord of the Treasury, What happens if the virus is still around in 2021/2 How will the bankrupt UK manage?

1315885131970867200 2020-10-13 13:20:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson  You have surrounded yourself with blinkered thinking scientists and others. Ignoring advice coming from many, a great many, scientists and health workers with contrary views. Before being forced into a full lockdown, Bring in those scientists etc and LISTEN to them

We ignore the plight that have put their lives on the line for us. Contemptible.

1315561919017881600 2020-10-12 15:56:18 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SurferObserver @actiontiff @MailOnline What about shopping lists?
1315551322675073024 2020-10-12 15:14:11 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spcb @NicolaSturgeon It does appear to me that the 60% are frightened to express an opinion. I was in Glasgow a week before the referendum. Plenty of Independence stickers etc. Very few of pro UK! The SNP have created this disgraceful state of affairs. They must be eradicated.
1315527156982788099 2020-10-12 13:38:10 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Can you believe it. Theresa May has been asked by @BorisJohnson to head up the COP21 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November 2021.. I would have thought this was a job for the Prime Minister. He should be speaking for the UK , not a discredited former PM.
1315522475434934272 2020-10-12 13:19:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The British media,  desperate to try to influence the Presidential election, are still placing their stories on opinion polls which proved to be hopelessly wrong last time. When will opinion polls during election campaigns be banned? They are just left wing attempts to influence.
1315518951812718592 2020-10-12 13:05:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @JulieBe50174159 @BorisJohnson Well good luck. Please let us know how you get on.
1315516829864022016 2020-10-12 12:57:08 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @JulieBe50174159 @BorisJohnson Madge, They have banned 70’s from having the scan.
1315509570098417665 2020-10-12 12:28:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> HOW can any government countenance withholding breast cancer mammogram scans from women aged 70? But this government has removed all adverts which allowed that age group to have that scan.These ladies have paid into the NHS all their working lives. WHY @BorisJohnson  WHY?

All clothes shops to close. Pubs restaurants &amp; take always closed. Authority must be given to leave home. People advised to sell their cars to pay the COVID-19 tax.

1315315734508118018 2020-10-11 23:38:03 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @PatrioticSocia1 The South will break away from the North. President Trump will be made The President of Southern States of America. President Trump will have the Armed Services behind him.
1315313339959062529 2020-10-11 23:28:32 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Robert Jenrick has to be demoted. He is sly, sails very close to the wind and is a politician you just know you cannot trust him. Answering Marr, who was surprisingly fair and well briefed he showed Jenrick up for what he is..a snake oil salesman.
1315308583794479105 2020-10-11 23:09:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MickboatyMike Thank you Mike.
1315293265613201409 2020-10-11 22:08:46 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Lisa Tandy MP is trying her hardest to re-create the North South divide. @BorisJohnson must reassure the North that he means business. Labour Mayors and MP’s are not helping the fight against Covid19 . Tandy has been nothing less than disgraceful. She is inciting nothing less.
1315259907671719936 2020-10-11 19:56:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ClarkeMicah @biogranjan I do think this selected sentence from the article, which I appreciate you have attached, is taken out of context. The article is Furious with Government and that sentence was addressed to them as part of this excellent and hard hitting article. Please read the article in full.

1315207385884037122 2020-10-11 16:27:30 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The people in the North, in Wales &amp; I suspect Scotland are crying out for @BorisJohnson to lead. To cast aside experts and make HIS mind up. Lockdowns do NOT stop the virus. Lockdowns create unemployment, closures of businesses and Total frustration with a PM who is not listening
1315204540245962755 2020-10-11 16:16:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Congratulations to Hugh Pym,the BBC Health Correspondent, For winning the Charles Wheeler award for outstanding contribution to British Journalism. Goodness me. I apologise but I thought he was bore of the year.
1315176978887176192 2020-10-11 14:26:41 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson Without evidence will continue with more loss of our freedoms. Probably closing pubs and restaurants, hairdressers &amp; Barbers, probably because he never uses them. If Starmer moves to opposing lockdowns etc he will be pushing an open door. People are fed up.
1315173958560382976 2020-10-11 14:14:41 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The Sunday DM not good reading for @BorisJohnson  Serialising Tom Bowers book. Boris comes across as a cad. Peter Hitchens, writes “Did we vote Conservative as we wanted more Windmills?  Dan Hodges suggests wind farms became policy because Ms Symonds wants them. No good news here

1314875795672911873 2020-10-10 18:29:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Darren Grimes Made a podcast with David Starkey. He has been ordered to attend New Scotland Yard to be interviewed over the content and a statement made by Mr Starkey. Any prosecution has immense problems for journalists etc. @BorisJohnson THIS is on your watch. Do you agree?
1314871470028447746 2020-10-10 18:12:42 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I do hope the North Welsh Councils join The Northern Power House. The Welsh Assembly only caters for South Wales.
1314871087042265088 2020-10-10 18:11:10 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> One sentence, in an article in the DT by Charles Hymas. In which these ‘Marshals’ will have body cameras.  @BorisJohnson you have created a STASI State. You will never get it back to what it was. England my England, what thousands of men and women gave their lives? GONE FOREVER?  https://t.co/jLQraHkOTM
1314867702780092420 2020-10-10 17:57:44 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson  You never answer the question on EVIDENCE for the measures. You are considering closing hairdressers, barbers &amp; leisure businesses. Provide EVIDENCE of the numbers who got the virus after attending any of those. Is the percentage higher than 0.01%
1314864592061952000 2020-10-10 17:45:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @VickiPMcKellar @BorisJohnson Very, Vicki, Very!!
1314842287063564289 2020-10-10 16:16:44 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @alb353 @LSadler16861851 Nice to see the new @BBCDirectorGeneral  has hit the ground and stumbled.
1314838311765188614 2020-10-10 16:00:56 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Is lockdown a measure @BorisJohnson will use to prevent any crowd trouble if he gives in to EU demands. To get his deal?
1314837807957970944 2020-10-10 15:58:56 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @pennyone But @BorisJohnson wants a deal, he will do anything to get a deal. It is now suggested by Lord Frost that Boris is “softening” his stance on red lines. Look for an agreement tying the UK to the EU rules on State Aid and a major concession on Fishing.
1314834108850286592 2020-10-10 15:44:14 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MalcolmCowing Totally agree Malcolm.
1314824441872998400 2020-10-10 15:05:49 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> If,as it is suggested, @BorisJohnson is softening his approach to get a deal with the EU and by doing so will allow EU Rules to have “a small effect” over the UK. “Setting us free” was his clarion call. State Aid and Free Ports essential. ANY ‘small’ EU control is NOT FREE BREXIT
1314820874877403136 2020-10-10 14:51:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Did you read that David Dimbleby is “considering” putting his name forward to be the next BBC Chairman. He is upset that Number 10 wants to put an anti BBC man in the chair! The 81 year old has had his day and  David there is no such thing as the irreplaceable man!
1314813612842790912 2020-10-10 14:22:48 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> IF @BorisJohnson goes ahead, taking more of our freedoms away, ignoring the many eminent scientists who contradicted the two sitting on the PM’s shoulders, ignoring the evidence mini lockdowns do not work &amp; the time for a complete re-think NOW is essential. PM we need LEADERSHIP.
1314613856807907329 2020-10-10 01:09:02 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @PaulaBrexiteer The election of Theresa May.

1314595019848904704 2020-10-09 23:54:11 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MichaelYeadon3 @Michell82065319 It is a beautiful building. Llandudno is lovely too. WHAT #goes through the head of Drayford. North Wales should wake up, the Welsh Assembly only helps South Wales. North Wales Councils should create an alliance with the English Cities bordering them IF they want great prosperity
1314591551205576704 2020-10-09 23:40:24 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @dominiquetaegon @worrell_len What kind of person does this? Sorry we must demand that all candidates have an independent intelligence test prior to being officially adopted by the party.

1314514531696115713 2020-10-09 18:34:21 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @reporterboy Giles, I am so sorry for you and for your father. I wish him well and will pray for him. You are a caring man and I stand with you. Families come first. Be strong.

There comes a time when, frankly, for some enough is enough. We have a very diligent Chancellor. A very spur of the moment PM who is the first Lord of the Treasury.

1314475589877850112 2020-10-09 15:59:37 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I read that former Prime Minister Theresa May supported by members of her cabinet, Hunt, Green, Grayling,Hinds, Bradley and Nokes tore into the awful Robert Jenrick over planning &amp; green belt. I have this vision of May holding non cabinet meetings and still being addressed as PM.

He obviously thought he was the one for the job. I have met Allegra twice and was impressed. I do wish her well, but if Walker’s view isn’t shared, it may start off bumpy but she will do a good job.

1314448003453915137 2020-10-09 14:09:59 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Goodness, how the mighty has fallen. Conservative Home have a monthly survey of Conservatives view of the cabinet. The September survey is extremely interesting as it shows @BorisJohnson has a negative Of minus 10.3! He is not as popular as he and others would have us believe.  https://t.co/pkxSjADOtu
1314432575151247360 2020-10-09 13:08:41 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Days ago I asked  @BorisJohnson call a seminar involving scientists and others with differing views to Whitty and Vallance. The DM Editorial today says that ALL views on COVID-19 should be listened too. Boris owes it to the people, who are confused, to listen to those views.
1314314350019182598 2020-10-09 05:18:54 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @itv Watching the start of the Wales v England game. The players and officials went down on one knee. The TV commentator expressed that the players were doing it TO SUPPORT BLM. Do these people exactly what BLM is? When crowds return they will stop the knee nonsense. ALM

1314177378160201728 2020-10-08 20:14:37 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ClareWills9 I am sorry but I support Dr. Habeeb. I consider his letter extremely polite and explanatory. I could possibly understand it if the wanted to give her a vaccine, but that is just not the case. The health , indeed rights, of other patients must be taken into consideration.
1314175428270206977 2020-10-08 20:06:52 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @titch37322943 Of course Titch.
1314157632169574400 2020-10-08 18:56:10 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @dan63uk Well, you must admit, that it is a great issue within those towns and cities which have been changed into a Foreign land. Where white children are the minority in Schools. If must mind the fact that Whites will be the minority by the 2050’s
1314156445341036545 2020-10-08 18:51:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> That Brain of Britain,  Robert Edward Jenrick said the 10 0’clock was “Commonsensical”. No scientific basis then, can we be assured that ALL the Gentlemen’s Clubs etc are similarly controlled. The Houses of Parliament Building is not fit for purpose. It should be closed down.

1314084868649873413 2020-10-08 14:07:01 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> IF @BorisJohnson gives in on Fishing rights and kicks our Shipping Industry in the teeth, after all the assurances. Will all the fighting for Brexit be worth it?
1314084381678538755 2020-10-08 14:05:05 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> If we stay in The European Court of Human Rights Act all plans to have a new immigration bill will end. The UK will not be able to deport and, thus, Boris’s long held view to have an amnesty for ALL illegal migrants will become policy. Was all the fighting for Brexit worth this?
1314082983280881666 2020-10-08 13:59:32 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> A charlatan (also called a swindler or mountebank) is a person practising quackery or some similar confidence trick or deception in order to obtain money, fame or other advantages via some form of pretence or deception. Synonyms include shyster, quack, or faker. Sounds like err?
1314073939195371520 2020-10-08 13:23:36 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ClaireH38655873 I very much hope so too, Claire.
1314073246556467202 2020-10-08 13:20:50 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> One of the many complaints about @BorisJohnson is that he is NOT a Conservative. IF the reports that he has agreed to stay in the European Court of Human Rights are correct,That will prove that particular complaint and he should cross the floor of the House of Commons.
1314069585793085441 2020-10-08 13:06:18 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Remember @BorisJohnson promised to WALK AWAY if the proposed deal did not reflect what the British people Voted for. It appears Boris is yet another PM as weak as dishwater when dealing with the EU.  https://t.co/aVkm1tJSBF
1314068781036077062 2020-10-08 13:03:06 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> It looks as though PM @BorisJohnson wants a EU Trade deal at any price. He pledged to get out of the European Court of Human Rights...well Johnson’s keeping us in! Remember the pledge on Our Seas and Fishing Rights it looks like he is bending over on that as well. Capitulation!

1313898142518128640 2020-10-08 01:45:02 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I do hope Kelvin McKenzie is appointed Chairman of the BBC. A former  Editor of the most, popular Newspaper of the Country. Rough, brash just like a former Chairman Greg Dyke. Just what the vast majority of the populace requires to sort out the BBC. Keep Eton out of this job.
1313889790497038343 2020-10-08 01:11:51 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I hoped that the actions of Scotland and Wales over covic told @BorisJohnson devolution is a disaster for the United Kingdom. He must have a UK wide referendum on devolution to scrap it or to keep it. Although the UK Parliament has the power to scrap it, has Boris the backbone?

1313872189494620160 2020-10-08 00:01:55 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> No government has ever grasped the nettle BUT I find it both odd and disrespectful to the UK that students studying to be doctors, dentists etc in our Universities do not sign an agreement that they will dedicate five+ years to the National Health Service.
1313865364204335104 2020-10-07 23:34:47 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Many highly respected individuals are giving conflicting advice to @BorisJohnson over Covid 19. Perhaps the PM should call a seminar of top scientists etc at the O2. Such eminence cannot be ignored. A Compromise for a new way forward.  Ask Andrew Neil to facilitate.

That is unbelievable and unforgivable. The man thinks he is above criticism. You must do the right thing and sack Hancock this day.

1312797709703753730 2020-10-05 00:52:19 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> May I wish the President of the United States @realDonaldTrump and his wife the First Lady a return to good health. They have many friends in the United Kingdom. Good luck, my prayers are with you both.

1312715547642130432 2020-10-04 19:25:50 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Erictheowl1 @DanielJHannan Exactly, Eric, exactly.
1312715377458188289 2020-10-04 19:25:09 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @DanielJHannan @EileenBuck13 So that means we should ditch all mathematics thought by White, Black, Brown, Yellow and Pink mathematicians. All computers must be scrapped anything produced by humans as they, therefore, inherently carry human biases. Politicians &amp; Economists to be ditched unceremoniously.
1312667448194236416 2020-10-04 16:14:42 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Dan Hodges suggests in the MOS that four people are running the Country, not Boris. Cummings, Rikki, Gove &amp; Carrie Symonds. But the more interesting part is his suggestion that senior Civil Servants have a secret plan to upstage the Government. Sounds like a treasonous plot to me
1312665542554251264 2020-10-04 16:07:08 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> If you actually trusted the press and media you would think President Trump infected everybody. Ghastly one sided. Marr spreading the unfounded ‘rumour’ this morning.

1312433675448070146 2020-10-04 00:45:46 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @kenpopekpz As they chant in football stadia “What a load of rubbish” Group think is no real test of public opinion.

1312415982334480385 2020-10-03 23:35:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Living in North Wales. The Welsh Assembly have stopped people living in the Wrexham area leaving. Or people from outside entering. Wrexham FC are playing Boreham Wood FC in Wrexham today. I am not opposed to the game being played just showing the total futility of local measures.
1312368889607729152 2020-10-03 20:28:20 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @hanbulance But joking aside, you must be very proud. Congratulations.

1312353710102794240 2020-10-03 19:28:01 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Thank you Robert. It shows that the Conservative Party Are a clear and present danger to the United Kingdom. Will John Major apologise for allowing us to be reduced to a third world country. Time for us to ditch Agenda 21.

1312346274386018305 2020-10-03 18:58:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Like in so many years past I will be taking the Flu jab next week. So I will be having the flu some days later.

1312344391667912705 2020-10-03 18:50:59 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson  “Those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty or safety”  A favourite quote of Boris Johnson, quoting Benjamin Franklin.
1312340014345457665 2020-10-03 18:33:36 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Anorakian The family are ever so woke.

Endangering passengers and officials on the railway, Twice, taxi’s to and from Parliament and hotel, shops she may have visited both in Glasgow and London. To be frank to attempt to equate like with like is, frankly,  Outrageous.
1312336745300623361 2020-10-03 18:20:36 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @rdevitoboutin Robert, So this Global Government is being foisted on us. Did May agree this? Many people have expressed to me that Churchill would probably be saying  we have elected a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma!
1312275171663900672 2020-10-03 14:15:56 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Can members of the Royal Family do anything without their courtiers approval. The hold the late Private Secretary, Sir Alan Frederick "Tommy" Lascelles, GCB, GCVO, CMG, MC Had over King George V1 &amp; Queen Elizabeth was extraordinary. He, it appeared, made their decisions for them.
1312271071232622592 2020-10-03 13:59:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @michaeljohnbad1 @WendyPuerto I do hope it is true today. We will need the Brits to make a united stand soon to ensure this country we love, our customs and way of life survive.
1312269166079078400 2020-10-03 13:52:04 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Are we retreating into a Medieval mind set. As people are confined to stay within the curtilage of their Towns or Cities. Will City Walls be rebuilt? Will we have guard posts on roads leading from and to our towns? CCTV ensuring no strangers enter or residents leave with no pass.
1312266855432806400 2020-10-03 13:42:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Why doesn’t this autocratic government, controlled by scientists with dodgy forecasts, allow sports to have HOME spectators only. It may ensure survival of  local sports teams. @BorisJohnson  you used to have an uncanny feel for the common view. Time to re-think.
1312263545694883841 2020-10-03 13:29:44 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The anger against Covid restrictions is growing in all forms. NO singing in pubs, YET the Royal Choral Society can sing @ the RAH. Before an audience of 5K! Such an attendance at football clubs would be a lifesaver. @BorisJohnson  says we have become complacent. He must re-think.
1312240778832498693 2020-10-03 11:59:16 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @paulrey99 It is about time the TV investigative journalists to report on these killings. But they are all so wrapped up pushing the BLM nonsense that they ignore these brutal killings. White lives do not matter to the news outlets.

It would be good if @BorisJohnson paid tribute to present British Taxpayers who helped pay for the end of Slavery. But you can bet he will not.
1312085201368084482 2020-10-03 01:41:04 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @willcarling @GwendolineSper1 Excellent interview. It is just so concerning. We are being led by a Prime Minister into a World Government without any mandate whatsoever. Unless someone can show me where it is hidden in their manifesto.
1312083163842215936 2020-10-03 01:32:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @mspdcali @JenniferMostre1 Wallace should wear a mask permanently. The man was a very bad choice.i find his ‘interviews’ always about Wallace. Time for some truth in the American Media. If they carry on they will end up with a Communist Dictator ship and Civil War.
1312081367627444224 2020-10-03 01:25:49 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @talkRADIO @milliedrane Well he is allowed his opinion. I believe firmly in free speech. It was the rock on which our democracy grew. I do not agree with him and should President Trump get re-elected he will find Hollywood / Netflix’s / Prime will not be looking in his direction.

1312065103035015168 2020-10-03 00:21:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @mr_squeege Well perhaps your ‘guys at work’ can explain how the UK will fare with a Democratic Party President. Or are they just led by the nose group think?
1312064165687721984 2020-10-03 00:17:28 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Did the cabinet approve the statement @BorisJohnson gave to the UN? Do they support his standing shoulder to shoulder with Bill Gates?! Do the Parliamentary Conservative Party support both statements from the Prime Minister. OR, as I am of the opinion, he did NOT consult anyone.
1312027919800205315 2020-10-02 21:53:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @VickiPMcKellar Are you applying for Holy Orders Vicki? That said you are so right and May I applaud you.
1312024625954598912 2020-10-02 21:40:21 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> We have had very poor Home Secretaries. @pritipatel has lowered the bar greatly. I expect her shortly to announce the illegal migrants will be given an amnesty and that will ensure they are no longer a problem. Simples. householders in Buckinghamshire will host the new British.
1312017872349278209 2020-10-02 21:13:31 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @DMMosullivan Donna, Of course you can eat it all it is a matter you. Best advice. But you could purchase a Frey Bentos pie for each. Settled. Cheapest Home Bargains! Sadly Waitrose do not sell them.

1311964445028085760 2020-10-02 17:41:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ExWren How about celebrating a Chinese History Month. They have much history to celebrate and much not too. We could have a Celebrate a Dictator month ending with a popular vote as to whom is the favoured Dictator of the Month. Entries based on numbers killed by or on orders.

1311940622618628097 2020-10-02 16:06:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @afneil There are many that fit that category, including myself, and some who have not reached President Trumps age. If the cap fits!

1311712750087876610 2020-10-02 01:01:04 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ClaraWSparkles I found in my past lives that if a man suddenly started growing a beard he had problems at home. Likewise if a woman changed her hairstyle. Not always but it occurred too often to be ignored.
1311704656540770304 2020-10-02 00:28:55 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ClaraWSparkles Thank you Clara. Jolly interesting. What a subject to bring up at a dinner party.
1311639534317207552 2020-10-01 20:10:08 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson  Call back our troops, the navy and RAF. prepare for any eventuality. Speak to the USA. we cannot trust the EU. How much more do you have to be told. Stand up for The United Kingdom.
1311637767051513856 2020-10-01 20:03:07 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> So the EU are taking Little Britain to The European Court of Justice created by the EU. So we can expect NO JUSTICE from that Star Chamber. @BorisJohnson should ask Parliament to agree to break off trade talks Announce we are now a free country and We will not recognise the ECJ.

Such is needed for people smuggling and all forms of slavery. That would definitely have an immediate effect on criminals indulging in such acts. Obviously ALL Murders must carry the death sentence.

1311577831957200896 2020-10-01 16:04:57 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> IS @BorisJohnson the sole arbiter? HS2 is a case in point. The financial estimates keep increasing. But Boris brushes aside any criticism. It really does demand an urgent re-assessment and a full debate in Parliament.  But we now live in a dictatorship where one man controls.

Now you &amp; your two scientific gloomsters, are at it and letting the pocket dictators in the Devolved Councils localise the fear. It will rebound Boris. Mark my words.

1311193306227970052 2020-09-30 14:36:59 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I am not a Fulham fan, like @truemagic68  and @richardosman but I have great respect for their manager, Scott Parker. who publicly criticised the co owner,  Tony Khan who had publicly apologised for the defeat. Parker stood by his players. He is to be applauded.  https://t.co/WYD28BJLBC

1311187460068642816 2020-09-30 14:13:45 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ChrisFraser1 Sarah, I think @BorisJohnson should read this a student of Churchill who has , so far, displayed NO Churchillian qualities.
1311187047441408001 2020-09-30 14:12:07 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @VickiPMcKellar Vicki, you are ON FIRE! Well said.
1311186541646094337 2020-09-30 14:10:06 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> BBC who NEVER give a fair assessment of President Trump, asked their North American editor Jon Sople for his assessment on the debate. That was like asking Theresa May to give an assessment on Boris Johnson. The BBC should, but won’t, keep out of this election. DG step in please.
1311184715790069760 2020-09-30 14:02:51 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Is Chris Wallace the Democrats Presidential Candidate? It was Trump v Wallace &amp; Biden.
1311183955299897346 2020-09-30 13:59:50 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @PritiPatel is out of her depth. She talks a good fight but stops there. When telling Parliament and the Country she would stop the channel illegals. She allows them to stay, hosting them in hotels etc. She must resign or be sacked. @BorisJohnson Needs a fresh STRONG cabinet.

1311176945493831680 2020-09-30 13:31:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I have to say that the Fox presenter Chris Wallace was next to useless last night. The test of a good Chairman is to allow a debate, stop interruptions, do not ask long unintelligible questions AND  show any bias for or against any participant. Wallace ruined last nights debacle.
1311175058530992128 2020-09-30 13:24:29 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> We shall see if Boris Johnson has got any backbone. Will he remove the whip from Theresa May MP? If not she will continue, within the Tory benches, of undermining his authority. He cannot avoid this. It is either sack her or a white feather for him.
1311173572413583360 2020-09-30 13:18:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @55in2020 Good luck to you. Fingers crossed.
1311172744080486402 2020-09-30 13:15:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I read that Prince Andrew, who fought in the Falklands War &amp; who holds Royal military titles will not attend the Cenotaph Remembrance Service. Do the Palace know more about the friendship with Jeffrey Epstein? It does appear that to be the case. A coverup will hurt the Monarchy.

1310940831717744643 2020-09-29 21:53:45 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson at his Press Conference in Exeter. Sticking to the script he was fine. But then came the rude awakening. He must have known he would be asked about the total confusion over the latest crackdown. He confused the confusion even more. It was a disgrace. He has lost it
1310868255788150785 2020-09-29 17:05:21 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Monsmoy1 @BorisJohnson She picked a cabinet consisting of a big majority of Remainers. The agitators were Leave supporters. Of course it created a complete mess as they were standing up for the majority who voted leave. I fear Boris will give in to the EU he has proved to be as weak as dish water.

1310792576962879489 2020-09-29 12:04:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @afneil is critical of the two names being suggested as  Chairman of the BBC and OFCOM. One having no broadcasting experience, No organising ability. That is a intriguing path. Do politicians have experience in running a Country? Will we ever get round pegs in round holes?
1310789891253571584 2020-09-29 11:53:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @IronicEnoch @Majeh19 Can you nominate your choice please.
1310788947971379200 2020-09-29 11:50:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SimonJonesNews So, continuing to do nothing.
1310787986800467969 2020-09-29 11:46:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ournickyintheuk Sir Desmond is absolutely correct. You cannot ever have the tail wagging the dog.
1310787223638470657 2020-09-29 11:43:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson has a cabinet of nodding donkeys. He must bring in people who would challenge him. Cummings must be curtailed. And I believe Hancock, Patel, Williamson, Jenrick, Shapps, Lewis, Milling and Braverman. Must make room for bigger beasts.
1310785216328486912 2020-09-29 11:35:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson can do no better than sacking Witty, Vallance and Hancock. He must bring in much needed experience into his cabinet. Especially those who would challenge him and protect him from the series of self made gaffs. A new approach is badly needed. Announce a Reshuffle.
1310689710638010375 2020-09-29 05:15:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @afneil some years ago Sky had a programme in which Lord Tebbitt and Austin Mitchell questioned a guest it was called Target. (I was a guest twice). Perhaps Mr Neil could consider Choo Choo Portillo and Alan ‘Postie’Johnson for a similar programme.

1309967532359639041 2020-09-27 05:26:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Where does @BorisJohnson find the money? I ask when he throws so much money around since elected. Billions there, millions here, trillions next no doubt. The trees he promised to plant must all be money trees. I am concerned that soon we will be facing great increases in taxation

1309823065988136961 2020-09-26 19:52:08 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Yesterday was not terror related, said  Commissioner Dick of the Yard. So it is quite normal to walk around with a revolver tucked in your trousers. Of course it was a terror incident in anyone’s definition. I do hope an MP has the guts to call this statement by Dick outrageous.
1309821630311522305 2020-09-26 19:46:26 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bluenobby @MailOnline Neil Basu the police officer who wants to join BLM.
1309820991716184065 2020-09-26 19:43:54 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Interesting in the DT on the murderer  The man was known to the authorities having been referred to a de-radicalisation programme!  Following further investigation it was deemed he did not pose a terror threat. I’ve heard that before. By the way yesterday was not terror related!
1309819434035564550 2020-09-26 19:37:42 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> All we get from @Priti Patel are words and promises to the future. In 1839 and 1842 politicians cared greatly for law and order. But Stop and SEARCH meant that. What frightens me is the thought that far more officers could have been killed yesterday.  Patel better ACT this week.

1309568623799922690 2020-09-26 03:01:05 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Well the Huddersfield Town and Nottingham Forest Football Clubs ignored the murder of a Police Officer but preferred to bend their knee for a criminal in the United States and the Comministic BLM. I switched off. If this continues over the weekend I will cancel Sky Sports.
1309556293137510400 2020-09-26 02:12:05 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @IanKop1 Yes and sometimes they were better than the film.

A sentence that it is very difficult is just treating the people with utter contempt.We need a full explanation &amp; when will they leave our Country?
1309543161396686852 2020-09-26 01:19:54 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> If the Premier League and Football League do not ban the bending the knee this weekend, after the murder of a Police Sergeant I, for one will be disgusted. As for Sky Sports No doubt they will still be telling us about the Criminal in America.  ALL LIVES MATTER.

1308685785118502913 2020-09-23 16:33:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Yesterday the Prime Minister gave the situation and measures to Parliament. As this was a health measure and he only speaks for England. WHY did the Speaker allow contributions from Scotland, Ireland and Wales? It is nonsensical.

Once he is allowed into the Venerable Society of Clowns, I will call him by his Official Clown name and picture his distinctive Clown sign which cannot , apart from his himself, be copied. Until that day it is Sir Keir.  I try to be polite.

But reading that they are trying to ban Wordsworth as his BROTHER sailed a ship to China is bordering on the insane. Advice: CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIPS.
1308635242408878081 2020-09-23 13:12:09 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Will @pritipatel publish the unabridged report on Pakistani gangs raping vulnerable white underaged girls throughout the United Kingdom. Identify those behind the decision NOT to arrest and also WHY the perpetrators have not been thrown out of the Country.
1308632352466313217 2020-09-23 13:00:40 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> What happens if and when the new proposals fail. The Army are on the streets, illegal migrants are still pouring into the Country, millions of jobs lost, businesses closed down, High Streets empty. What measures then?
1308631586691317760 2020-09-23 12:57:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @acblaauboer Yet, according to an opinion poll issued last evening, the majority support Boris. Work that one out.

1308630948737679360 2020-09-23 12:55:06 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Absolutehero69 R.I.P. ERNEST. A proud and brave member of the finest Police Force, The Royal Ulster Constabulary GM. Murdered whilst off duty by cowards given immunity from prosecution by Blair. And the proud name Royal Ulster Constabulary GM thrown in the dustbin to appease.
1308628605795262464 2020-09-23 12:45:47 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Sir Keir Starmer  in his leaders speech, brought into the political game his record as Director of Public Prosecutions. Didn’t mention his inaction over the Pakistani gangs and the abductions, rapes and sexual assaults of White underaged vulnerable girls? He refused to prosecute.
1308624379950116864 2020-09-23 12:28:59 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @susannareid100 Well perhaps the Government should call in Brain of Brixton Ms Susanna Reid to advise them.

1308510675698933761 2020-09-23 04:57:10 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @lucyallan @andy_Brexit @BorisJohnson Well first of all ask your constituents what they think. Not the Conservative Party members etc but others who voted Tory for the first time.this is just plain and simple ingratiating yourself.
1308509616679067648 2020-09-23 04:52:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @gardinea4 Pat I do appreciate what you say. I welcome your comment and accept that I cannot expect support for everything I write. Thank you.
1308475587779010563 2020-09-23 02:37:45 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Boris was seen leaving Deal beach in a dingy heading towards France.
1308467397150552071 2020-09-23 02:05:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @RitchieJune @BorisJohnson Grow up. The protesters were mainly white. I saw one Blackman. Just get a life. It is people like you that have created this hatred.
1308454282715373569 2020-09-23 01:13:05 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GowTolson Well my late turn shift of 2pm to 10pm ended on most nights have a pint of bitter in the local pub with colleagues and friends. Think of those that work shifts please. The 3pm to 11pm shift means a dry end. It is quite ridiculous.
1308452721092165633 2020-09-23 01:06:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Well I would hate to be in the Chitty or Vallance shoes if their scaremongering proves to be very wide of the Mark. So many jobs will have been lost, businesses closed down. NO Gvt will ever listen to experts again. But Boris and Hancock will feel the real anger from the people.
1308373019769921538 2020-09-22 19:50:10 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Can anyone tell my friend the viewing figures for Kay Burley?
1308372675476312071 2020-09-22 19:48:48 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I believed in @BorisJohnson  thinking he was the Lionheart to take us forward, bravely, yes taking risks, but fighting for the UK. Today he has turned into The cowardly lion. Hemmed in by Remainers &amp; experts denounced by other experts. Boris you have lost it Let us see who obeys.

1308358902535393281 2020-09-22 18:54:05 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Has Kay Burley been sacked yet? Just asking for a friend.
1308357744546717696 2020-09-22 18:49:29 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GowTolson @bbclaurak Right. You can be incredibly tough talking down a camera.
1308356910807224320 2020-09-22 18:46:10 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The lack of Common Sense in the cabinet, the willingness to be led by the nose by “experts” who were wrong last time. Plus the ridiculous Hancock.We are heading for an economic disaster. When Common Sense tells us to drop all this nonsense and let us get on with our lives.
1308355917453328390 2020-09-22 18:42:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> It is beginning to be one of two things. 1. A last concerted effort by the Remainers (I include Gove as one) to discredit @BorisJohnson @10DowningStreet Yesterday’s nonsense by the two ( Remember “we do not get involved in politics”). Gove on the radio today. WAKE UP BORIS.
1308331826445012992 2020-09-22 17:06:29 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Mr_W_Carpenter Patriotic to who? EU. BLM, Russia, North Korea, etc. Or the UK?  UK Not in a million years.

They will not get any help from those two party’s.
1308307592335286272 2020-09-22 15:30:11 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @JoanRigby8 @BorisJohnson Back in the day, 40’s/50’s etc, people did talk to strangers. Children were told not to, but the art of conversation &amp; Christin values were encouraged. But I was brought up UptNorth. I still talk to strangers, I say Good Morning, etc when passing ‘Strangers’. We need to talk more
1308303209962696704 2020-09-22 15:12:47 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bashersi @BorisJohnson As we all should be.
1308302636605612034 2020-09-22 15:10:30 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> It was no shock that The EU loving former PM told Parliament she will not be supporting Boris’s Bill. She was an embarrassment to the Country, now the Conservative Party. If she and other backbenchers vote against a three line whip, that whip must be withdrawn to ALL immediately.

1308293868031340551 2020-09-22 14:35:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I wish Sir Graham Brady MP and his many colleagues every success, seriously concerned about this authoritarian government dictating by Decree. Are we a DEMOCRATIC country? BUT  it  appears two health professionals are running the Gvt &amp; country. WE NEED leadership @BorisJohnson.
1308289905278234624 2020-09-22 14:19:54 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> By allowing the two apostles of doom, Twitty and Vallance, to hold a press conference @BorisJohnson lost any hold he had on political control of the Chinese Pandemic. Why no alternative Press Conference by Scientists who disagree, to give balance? Sorry we are being conned.

1307923211984818176 2020-09-21 14:02:48 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bry1050 Calm down. I said what an excellent suggestion it was to sell a work of art to save people’s jobs. If you believe a sculpture, which only members of the Royal Academy can view, presumably, is far more important than we little people, then I must disagree.

1307914311180918784 2020-09-21 13:27:26 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I will be called a Philistine but I believe, reading The Royal Academy are considering selling Michelangelo’s sculpture ‘Taddel Tondo’ to save 150 jobs. What a noble suggestion. The State has many fine art works locked away in vaults. Why not sell those off to help the Treasury?  https://t.co/wH0Nu8BMEH

MAY I suggest just asking us all to take care, Keep Calm &amp; Carry On. No partial lockdown. Leave it to us to be responsible for our family.

I would suggest joining @Nigel_Farage when he starts again. THAT would be enough to scare all Westminster. Just think 50 million join up to get behind him. Just cannot be ignored. No pipe dream. Common Sense.

1307238505396023296 2020-09-19 16:42:01 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @JuliaHB1 Matt Hancock told me on @talkRADIO that the False Positive Rate of Covid tests in the community is "under 1%". Sounds good, doesn't it? WRONG!  An FPR of 0.8% when the virus prevalence is so low means that at least 91% of "Covid cases" are FALSE POSITIVES.
1307230658398429188 2020-09-19 16:10:50 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @politicshome TYPICAL NOT complaining about the non publication of the rapes, beatings, and serious sexual assaults on white girls, minors and highly vulnerable by mainly Pakistani GANGS. Of course that would have heavily implicated the Labour Party. But no they overlook them again. DISGUSTING

I suggest YOU CANCEL all the lockdowns and other measures and support the Swedish solution and in true British style (once) IGNORE the pandemic and CARRY ON regardless.

How would it be structured, elected President or Royal Family, opposition party’s allowed or not?  Membership, who or what system to choose representatives. Based on the USA with Two houses. Republicans and Democrats etc. Jolly interesting thought.

This Cabinet is full of yes men/women and people you would not trust with a brush and pan. Start again @BorisJohnson WE DID have confidence in you. START AGAIN.
1306895557013712896 2020-09-18 17:59:16 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @PritiPatel you have told the people (indigenous)of the U.K. that you will not implement the full border control until June 2021.  We have ZERO confidence in you. RESIGN or @BorisJohnson put someone in charge who WILL man the barricades. The present situation is a damned disgrace

1306859899431854080 2020-09-18 15:37:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> For years Executive Vice Chairman, Ed Woodward, has promised a Director of Football to control the buying and selling of players for Manchester United. Each year he continues to show his expertise in getting players. But if things go wrong, he sacks the manager! Nice!!!  https://t.co/IQtS5rOxfa
1306850567088738304 2020-09-18 15:00:29 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @HappilyUnwoke I have signed the petition. But when you realise the scale of the problem, the need for a stand alone Immigration Service run by the police or Armed Services. We cannot trust the Civil Service obviously. We also need a new Aliens Act.
1306849242712092672 2020-09-18 14:55:14 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> We cannot go on like this, from the Public Accounts Committee, The Home Office is certainly NOT fit for purpose. Immigration must be controlled by the Police. Also we need a mandatory National Identity Card which must be issued under strict supervision, to avoid Impersonation.  https://t.co/P874WRQ20e
1306835029281181697 2020-09-18 13:58:45 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @DevonshireDanUK It certainly appears that way. @BorisJohnson is a major disappointment. The row over the WA showed that he never read it. He ignored the Ulster Unionists who warned that it was a trap. But he brought it to the Commons saying it was oven ready!!  A fine mess he has got us into.
1306834039752593408 2020-09-18 13:54:49 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @photomikeyhere Well 1/10 suggests they have done something well.WHAT? Precisely.

1306664111770677248 2020-09-18 02:39:35 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson  sit back in a park bench. Just breath in the fresh air of Green Park, then consider a sensible way out of the mess you have created. (You told Parliament that the WA was a good bill). Walk away from the talks we do not trust the EU. WTO and move on. No fish.
1306661657150738436 2020-09-18 02:29:50 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I cannot believe it. Guido reports that @BorisJohnson is considering Proroguing Parliament again to get his bill through the Lords. I do believe we are heading towards a Constitutional Crisis with that House of Lords packed as it is with QC’s and Remainers.
1306650958257160199 2020-09-18 01:47:19 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Who are QC’s / Lawyers/Solicitors responsible too? If Law officers are answerable to the Courts, how, in all honesty, can they represent their electorate when their judgement Is based on their position as a Lawyer etc. How can they stand for Parliament? Or appointed to the Lords?

Our beloved Country invaded silently by Aliens who speak in a foreign tongue &amp; changed whole towns &amp; cities into carbon copies of places from whence they came. Respecting our Customs? Of course not. Will we ever  Have Paradise Regained?
1306575740633321473 2020-09-17 20:48:26 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson Boris has certainly been drained of all  energy and drive. WHY did he not STAND UP for the enraged population over the nasty and ridiculous BLM. Taking the knee  reminds me of the England Football Team giving the Nazi salute in 1930 Germany. Boris wake up.
1306574196152119297 2020-09-17 20:42:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MikeSwadling @toadmeister @FraserNelson  1)Thanks Mike for hat tip to two articles in The Spectator Toby Young explains why he has lost confidence in @BorisJohnson and Fraser Nelson asks the Question WHERE is Boris? both are, for Boris supporters, sobering pieces.

1306487252118315013 2020-09-17 14:56:48 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @lisa_melvin I will take that in hand and get back to you.
1306487047423750144 2020-09-17 14:56:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I do hope the BBC in their drive for inclusivity do not overlook Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan, South Sea Islanders, South American people, Canadian, non EU Europeans. Russian. Australian, NZ, &amp; French who all in large and small numbers live in the UK.
1306485971169554433 2020-09-17 14:51:43 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GowTolson @BBCNews They are just raising the finger to the new Director General. There has to be a mass clear out of back room producers, directors who influence the presenters obviously. The people who employ them. The hold they have is extremely worrying. Cut down the number of Presenters.

I find the rhetoric from both the EU,  Biden, Pelosi in the USA plus Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Calum Eastwood MP (no relation) extremely worrying.@BorisJohnson must send out the message that they are all playing with fire! And must desist.
1306462005386190848 2020-09-17 13:16:29 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Can @BorisJohnson explain the difference between the threats from Barnier + President of the EU AND the threats of Joe Biden, Pelosi and more Democratic Party, IRA supporters. I have never trusted the EU. I have never trusted the Democrats in America. Please explain?

Can we have some backbone from @BorisJohnson please.
1306137407620866048 2020-09-16 15:46:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I have never forgiven the USA collecting money for the IRA.  “ Our greatest Ally” was indirectly pulling the trigger of the weapons that killed our brave servicemen and women and so many from the bravest Police Force, The Royal Ulster Constabulary. GM.

1305778145707126784 2020-09-15 15:59:04 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> IMPORTANT: MASSIVE CLEARANCE!  Number 10. Have a large number of discontents who are using dubious, allegedly “moral” issues to deny their constituents a true Brexit. They are going cheap, although future expenses may prove costly. Time to show that this Tory Gvt WILL BACK BREXIT
1305763377852100610 2020-09-15 15:00:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @richardtgarland @SimonPearson961 This was an excellent speech.
1305762919720906752 2020-09-15 14:58:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Did Sir Roger Gale and Sir Bob Neil support Blair’s Iraqi War in contravention to a UN resolution?  please explain the difference between the killing of so many British and Iraqi lives against the UN resolution or ensuring Northern Ireland remains within the United Kingdom.
1305761139318558721 2020-09-15 14:51:30 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> How many of those Tories claiming the Moral High Ground voted to support the Blair Iraqi War in contravention to a UN charter? Conveniently forgotten!

This Undemocratic “unnamed” nonsense must stop. NAME AND SHAME.

1305756762486734849 2020-09-15 14:34:06 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The Labour Party without their leader, still have not understood that their former supporters will never return to this Pro EU Party. They conveniently forget their past record, under Blair, for breaking International  Charters, declaring war on Iraq. British blood on their Hands
1305754071308152832 2020-09-15 14:23:24 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The ReBorn Brexit Party now has many names and constituencies to work on over the next four years. The full Tory ‘opposition’ citing a bogus moral cause ‘International Law’ will be identified next week. They will not escape the anger of the voters. Nigel Farage will ensure that.
1305749375512125442 2020-09-15 14:04:45 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @danielmgmoylan @WendyPuerto Well if these lawyers were influenced by the heads of chambers, more fool them. They answer to their electorate, not their chambers. This just shows how the establishment acts, behind the scenes and totally undemocratic. Such chambers should be ostracised.
1305597832813072384 2020-09-15 04:02:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The Barnett Formula puts Scots, Welsh and Ulster better off per man woman and child than the English. HOW can this injustice be allowed. The English are sick of the vile Insults from the SNP And their supporters. As in Wales. But the take OUR money.  Time to end it.

May I say the arrogance and insulting SNP politicians are nauseating and hypocritical. I want an English Parliament to put a stop to the  Barnett Formula.
1305578253000888325 2020-09-15 02:44:46 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> WHY has no Conservative mentioned to the Labour Hypocrites about breaking International Law. Breaking the UN resolution not to declare war on Iraq?  They have the blood of good British Soldiers on their hands sending the to a ILLEGAL WAR. Hypocrites ALL.

But in your report of the Christening of Wilfred Johnson. You referred to Boris and Carrie as “The first Couple” The first Couple in the UK are The Queen and Prince Philip!

1305371683805593600 2020-09-14 13:03:56 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Much as I admire @SirGeoffreyCox PC QC MP , I know him as a good man. He is also no fool and is a superb Lawyer. I accept that. But the EU are now threatening us. The answer has to be to accept that the WA is a danger to us, End negotiating, Cancel the WA and leave with No Deal.

1305099974271799296 2020-09-13 19:04:16 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Major+Blair and the two parties under them and successors, Brown, Cameron &amp; MAY All sang from the same EU Hymn sheet. NEVER forget Nigel Farage, UKIP &amp; the Brexit Party brought the downfall of Cameron &amp; May. @BorisJohnson is trying to get Brexit done. I am backing him this week.
1305097916051324928 2020-09-13 18:56:05 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @britishtisbest5 Thank You Tom.
1305069870082555904 2020-09-13 17:04:38 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @KeyserSosse R.I.P. Jason. A brave young man from Liverpool, Serving Queen and Country who whilst fighting the Taliban in that hellhole, Helmand Province, Afghanistan. Was killed. Any soldier on foot patrol there earns my total respect, they knowing what has gone on before. HEROES ALL.
1305068592585740288 2020-09-13 16:59:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Justice Minister Robert Buckland QC MP was extremely good. I wish him well. Actually Marr was, throughout, fair. More like that and. May watch him regularly. Testing the awful Irish Minister,toying with lightweight Rachel Reeves.
1305062299405778945 2020-09-13 16:34:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Rachel Reeves MP had memorised he speech for tomorrow’s debate. Twice mentioned ‘tonight’ meaning, I guess, tomorrow. She has shown herself to be rather brain dead when appearing with Andrew Neil and Micheal Choo Choo Portillo.
1305060291412144128 2020-09-13 16:26:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bruce_bwkm Change the Station. @Classicsfm for you dear Bruce. To calm you. To restore a less hastily and rushed existence. Nothing is better for you than classical music.
1305034952858316800 2020-09-13 14:45:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Instead of pleading to Academics to back the latest attack on our freedoms. May I suggest to @BorisJohnson he adopts his once famous Common Sense approach &amp; SCRAP all these draconian clampdowns. Elderly and sick people will take precautions. Time to TRUST THE PEOPLE not experts.
1305026099244654594 2020-09-13 14:10:42 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @MickGreenhough @WendyPuerto Yes Mick. We have had some really bad ones in recent years. Not one of stature to be sure. Major, Blair, Brown,  Cameron and May each one putting the EU first and UK last. MP’s too busy with their noses in the expenses trough, not doing anything to stop them.
1305024727719841793 2020-09-13 14:05:15 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @NotPooey @psychicpenny @enuffsa1d You say you are “Not sure” yet when people here suggest Drugs, Drink, Loan Sharks you say  https://t.co/KpPw2Cav8F. my advice to you is to First stop defending him. He is a thief. He will do it again. Change your cards and give him HELL.
1305011941811916801 2020-09-13 13:14:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @spikedonline Surely it is being a Christian. Thousands of men, women &amp; Children Christians killed in Africa by Muslim terrorists as in Syria. I admire Tony Abbott who stands by his beliefs. Sadly the CofE has not! By not fighting those who decry Christian beliefs.
1304889668786425862 2020-09-13 05:08:35 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The Stasi tactics apparently are coming here!  “SHOP THE NEIGHBOUR LINE”,  iF TRUE..The mad Hancock has truly taken over. This madness must stop. Today. The police and the Army could not contain mass protests. Stop now for Goodness Sake.

1304803578318651392 2020-09-12 23:26:29 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Ruthowe33470575 The withdrawal act was originally negotiated with the EU by former Prime Minister Theresa MAY. You cannot blame, sadly, the EU. MAY AGREED EVERY WORD, by your “we Brexiteers” are you suggesting I am not?
1304800437736964097 2020-09-12 23:14:01 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @AndrewRosindell @Ruthowe33470575 We got behind Boris to become leader,  to win the General Election. He now tells the Great British people the Withdrawal Agreement was agreed when NOBODY? knew then or until last January of the pitfalls. I agree we must pass the emergency bill. But I’m disgusted with MP’s frankly
1304792967857803264 2020-09-12 22:44:20 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @robertwlk Life was a gas until then!
1304792484921389058 2020-09-12 22:42:24 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @philiprichards5 Philip, The BBC do not acknowledge our history. They abuse it by changing facts into fiction. But you, as usual, are correct. Let’s not facts, the truth, get in the way of lies.
1304791529878360073 2020-09-12 22:38:37 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @philiprichards5 Blair broke International Law when he took us unto the Iraq War, broke A UN declaration and also Lied to the House of Commons and took us into that war.  But the Remainers and the left wing BBC/SKY etc never mention that fact. May neither.
1304789277977567234 2020-09-12 22:29:40 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @oflynnsocial Goodness. I remember the very narrow away supporters stand behind the goal. The long walk across the fields from the car park. Happy memories. Good luck. I suppose I should return to Oldham Athletic

Present ones are brilliant. Up North my team Wigan Athletic decimated by Chinese &amp; V poor EfL supervision. players snapped up bargain basement prices. So sad.

1304671602785824768 2020-09-12 14:42:04 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @reporterboy @bruce_bwkm I thought that you would make an ideal Covic Marshall Giles. Dressed in Stetson, Cowboy Boots,  Jeans and a plastic Marshal’s badge on a leather waistcoat over a  Check shirt. Plus the obligatory leather string with metal clip tie. You could have a belt and a holster for effect?
1304670227427459072 2020-09-12 14:36:36 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @KeyserSosse R.I.P.  Jason. A brave young hero. Yet another young man fighting for Queen and Country in that hell hole Helmand Province.
1304669647057362944 2020-09-12 14:34:18 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Betty06417439 I agree Betty. Some people ignore the simple solutions and complicate everything. Unless of course it is all a clumsy tactic to get the deal that @BorisJohnson  is so Desperate to achieve.
1304668863225901057 2020-09-12 14:31:11 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I read that Gvt was ‘warned’ in January of the danger to the UK written in to the Withdrawal Agreement.  This deceitful and anti democratic document was another of May’s tactics to keep us tied to the EU. It must be scrapped in total. What other nasty surprises does it hold?
1304667519739928579 2020-09-12 14:25:50 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Alongwith cancelling the Withdrawal Act Government must have another Bill Closing down the Supreme Court. Restoring Law Lords as the final Court of Appeal after the Appeals Court.
1304666694913269761 2020-09-12 14:22:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Why doesn’t the Government just walk away from the trade talks. Prepare a bill cancelling the Withdrawal Agreement,  and refuse to give the EU another penny. Their threat to take us to their EU Friendly Court is insulting. Just walk away now. WTO rules apply.

1304475300382871553 2020-09-12 01:42:02 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Rob_Kimbell I agree but the real fault is @BorisJohnson it was he that believed the battle was won &amp; allowed those he had removed the whip from, back into the party. Allowed them to stand in the General Election &amp; to crown it all places Hammond in the Lords. You cannot excuse such stupidity.

1304366586715869184 2020-09-11 18:30:02 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson  They won’t go away. Saying voting against the motion to change the Withdrawal Agreement is not a sacking offence SHOWS REAL WEAKNESS. It is essential you call a THREE LINE WHIP and those that abstain or vote against LOSE THE party whip.Independent UK is the prize.

1304326113628430336 2020-09-11 15:49:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> May is organising, no doubt about it. She can see that @BorisJohnson is on the ropes. His backbenchers are revolting, he is or even HAS lost his grip. He being controlled by “experts” again.  IS May eyeing the crown again? To finish the job and stay in her beloved EU? God help us
1304319023707041797 2020-09-11 15:21:02 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> So the majority of the Corona (Chinese Pandemic) Committee were AGAINST the “Rule of 6” Let that sink in. Hancock got his way!  Fear takes hold of @BorisJohnson &amp; Co. cowards. Liberty has a petition people may find of  interest.   https://t.co/1AwD6lWxYF
1304079026294792192 2020-09-10 23:27:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I watched Hancock give his account to the Commons. He is so full of himself, cocky and smug. The worst kind of leader. The sooner this weak individual is confined to the dustbin of history the sooner. @BorisJohnson has chose such a weak cabinet, which compliments his weakness.

1303946783383576577 2020-09-10 14:41:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Robt_O @BorisJohnson 🤷‍♂️🤷🏽‍♀️
1303942647745310720 2020-09-10 14:25:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @PJDarran200 @Captain34466242 @UKChange The election for the Mayor of London has to be for the whole United Kingdom to determine. It is our capital and we cannot allow anyone, such as Khan,  to create such damage to London. I hope that @BorisJohnson will bring in Legislation to that effect.
1303941907496816640 2020-09-10 14:22:31 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> One hopes that when, as his son has tweeted, President Trump orders his troops back home from Afghanistan and Iraq our Prime Minister @BorisJohnson  has already issued the same order. If not our troops will be in a very dangerous position indeed.
1303941030635540480 2020-09-10 14:19:02 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @stockportjr John, I disagree. So you want the Army on the streets? I want the Police to police the streets. The rank and file want to do the job but those that run the forces have no idea on policing. Marshals could be the final straw for the public. I hope I am wrong- we shall see.
1303940076263612418 2020-09-10 14:15:14 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson has hit a new low for me. These COVID Marshals are a disgraceful idea. SACK Whoever suggested them. POLICE are the ones to do this job and they have all the powers needed. YOU get more ex servicemen &amp; women into the police &amp; Get Police Chiefs who know about POLICING
1303938682366431232 2020-09-10 14:09:42 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson Do you REALLY CARE? This story in the DM. A simple question W H Y should 200 families have to wait longer to be reunited because YOUR Defence Secretary need a plane? You do not give a toss.  https://t.co/K6BsnwAxae
1303927831701979137 2020-09-10 13:26:35 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Just what powers will the new U.K. Marshals have? Will they have a uniform? Sadly I think this is a Communistic UNBRITISH idea and will not go down well with the people. The Marshals will be run off the streets and I fear for their safety.
1303925697619070976 2020-09-10 13:18:06 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Ministers or others who wish to remain “off the record” should either have some guts or just shut up. I believe in Freedom of Speech. Suppression of the person/s name making statements should not be allowed.
1303925003914805249 2020-09-10 13:15:21 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I am of the view that unattributable statements should not be used by newspapers and the media. The Financial Times, this morning, has a statement from an unnamed EUOfficial critical of @BorisJohnson it could have been a cleaner, a cook, anyone. Or worse made up for them story’

1303734535612502022 2020-09-10 00:38:30 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The speaker of the House (responding to a question from Desmond Swayne, Conservative, critical of Hancock)was extremely upset that the Gvt was not making policy announcements FIRST to the Commons. Must be annoyed by the Prime minister making his announcement on the TV today.

This was the one, if I am correct, when you tried tribal arts to rid the Country of Theresa May. It came to pass you should have Kissed his feet. But you could never keep your hands to yourself.
1303725978250809344 2020-09-10 00:04:29 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @pritipatel. You are in charge of the illegal migrants. You have allowed these migrants to be housed in City Centre hotels and in Birmingham close to a proud City of Birmingham Girls School. Now get your finger out and move them to a safe compound away from our young people. PDQ.

1303651705909915648 2020-09-09 19:09:22 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> There will be NO public support for the 6 rule until this rule applies to ALL people. Mosques MUST be closed. Homes used as Mosques must be closed. Street prayers Also must ge banned.

1303647636390588416 2020-09-09 18:53:11 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Groups of SIX but not in Mosques. Are we living in a Democracy or is this Government on their knees to the Muslim community?
1303646266832887809 2020-09-09 18:47:45 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I must say the tweet from @RobNicholls is extremely concerning. Does @BorisJohnson know the chaos building up in cities and towns caused by @pritipatel housing illegal migrants in Cities and towns. Detention Centres surely?  https://t.co/CeuQWLHDa1
1303635146030100482 2020-09-09 18:03:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Aldeanuk Will he wear his Queens Counsel Robes and Wig? That would give him greater authority than rag bag Johnson. Have we ever had a more scruffy individual as Prime Minister. I do not like Starmer but he always dresses very smartly. Boris?  I expect him to have string around his pants.
1303634129192353793 2020-09-09 17:59:31 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @robertwlk Great. I am positively negative.

Who made the decision for this hotel in close proximity to a girls school to be used by illegal migrants.  Are you wanting the White Population to RIOT?
1303628866259505152 2020-09-09 17:38:36 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Lasalvagie I love Singapore. I must look up my relatives next time I visit for a cheap holiday.

Now with so many unelected bods in their departments easy for matters to be leaked or given out because the PM /Minister wants gauge opinion. Politicians are at fault.

She may be lonely too, you having relocated. So she may not have friends yet. You both need something to enjoy away from your work./ children. Talk to your wife  Leigh.
1303599813594935296 2020-09-09 15:43:09 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Suffolklord @BorisJohnson Mark, Sad for your wife and for so many small businesses and concerns. I just do not get it at all. Are they trying to batter us into submission.  We should treat this as flu and go about life regardless.
1303586029396529153 2020-09-09 14:48:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Leigh__York Leigh, perhaps you are over sensitive. Your feelings are the same as so many people trapped in this surreal world created by a weak PM and a lover of self publicity Hancock.. (he is certainly no comedian). I admire your work ethic? just remember DONT LET THE BUGGERS GET YOU DOWN!
1303584062775463937 2020-09-09 14:40:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I do believe negative news journalists should be sent for re-education. Can anyone suggest the best  re-education establishment?

1303581204369866752 2020-09-09 14:29:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Whosaffeard Sorry, “eradicate” (destroy completely; put an end to.) farming. Yet ‘force grown, processed food for the world’. If there are no farms how will this be done?
1303580414796345344 2020-09-09 14:26:04 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Article1066 @WendyPuerto Good to see the EU getting a bit of their own medicine isn’t it?  By the way, MAY talked about the World not trusting Great Britain. Blair’s illegal war, led to the Foreign Office Senior Law Office resigned as she said it broke international law, That had no effect on Trust in GB
1303578588504096768 2020-09-09 14:18:49 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Robt_O @BorisJohnson Yes Robert, supposed is my omission. Alleged also. I will take the walk of shame. Sorry.

1303572200532959232 2020-09-09 13:53:26 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @The_RealTruth18 Yes English Cricket better consider if a crowd was in attendance what would be the reaction? I am afraid footballers will soon find out how much their supporters think of this foolish gesture.

1303563856728469504 2020-09-09 13:20:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The rule of 6. Who determined this figure? The same experts who predicted the end of the world as we know it, last time? It is about time @BorisJohnson started LEADING and not being played, as he is, by bloody experts.
1303563172763308033 2020-09-09 13:17:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @stoney632 They do not understand that if they are in prison, they have been found guilty of a crime/s. It is like the police, here, being criticised for stopping more black people than whites. If the person they are searching for is black do they now have to 🛑 stop Whites just for balance

1303561141499695104 2020-09-09 13:09:29 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Lasalvagie We are related to Westwood’s Geographically. Little woods are related to Forests or Forrests. Be careful about Rain Forests and even worse Jungles as you may find yourself playing Jumanji, that would cause chaos. But are we not all supposed to be related to each other?
1303439133818355712 2020-09-09 05:04:40 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GowTolson I think she will join the Green Party.

1303433217517780994 2020-09-09 04:41:10 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @GowTolson They are all saying it is a Treaty. Who am I to argue against it. But President Trump walked away from a Treaty and hell and damnation did not happen. That occurred recently when the son of Satan announced he was standing against Trump.

1303371159153541120 2020-09-09 00:34:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BrexitHome @WendyPuerto Still fighting the EU’s corner. What a ghastly woman.
1303370776855416838 2020-09-09 00:33:03 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @truemagic68 @DMcWilliams_UK Yes, I agree. Jolly good read.
1303370491512655872 2020-09-09 00:31:55 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @ColinDa19415235 @timothysturm2 But she is black and black lives mattered.
1303370304761352199 2020-09-09 00:31:10 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Have we got an Attorney General? Has she been silenced. Does she agree with the Prime Minister? One thing The Rt.Hon and Learned Sir Geoffrey Cox PC, QC, MP would have not hidden. We know that @BorisJohnson  only picked ministers who were malleable.
1303369042846191618 2020-09-09 00:26:09 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @DCBMEP Surely TRUST and THERESA MAY.  A CONTRADICTION of TERMS, a misnomer She tried her best to keep us in the EU. In bygone days she would have been tried for Treason and lost her head.
1303356023768576003 2020-09-08 23:34:25 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Teresa May asking whether the Government can be trusted? A Fine One to talk,  She and her acolytes shamelessly did the EU’s work for them. By passing cabinet. Secret talks, working against National Interest. She still does not get how angry the people are still with her.
1303309838664052736 2020-09-08 20:30:54 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @RazzZinger “Actually I am a confirmed carrier”.

1303302161380642818 2020-09-08 20:00:24 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> See Traitor May stood up defending her negotiations. She still believes she was correct. Goodness the Conservative Party need to get rid of her and ALL Remainers.
1303301752284999681 2020-09-08 19:58:46 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @SeanAKehoe Agreed Sean. Sadly not only London Midlands Cities and towns, Northern Towns and Cities the same. The Muslim communities control most councils. You tell me this was not planned.

1303298545185939459 2020-09-08 19:46:01 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Labour talking about TRUST. Nothing about the EU breaking their obligation to respect the UK as a Independent Free Nation. Labour still wants to be part of the EU. Incidentally the others who appear to be opposed to the change are State of Ireland Politicians and IRA supporters.
1303290250408669184 2020-09-08 19:13:04 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @robertwlk It was far more straight forward with a typewriter.
1303289642435870720 2020-09-08 19:10:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @robertwlk Strange I went on one on Decision Making. I cannot decide if I liked it or not.

1303274784269234182 2020-09-08 18:11:36 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @robinbull1 @PublicHealthW @PHE_uk As you live in the garden of England, Robin, I am not amazed at that price. But with us regaining our fishing waters that price will fall considerably and the size of fish be larger. But I would be surprised in many POOR areas of cities and towns fish and chips will cost far less
1303271665237995521 2020-09-08 17:59:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Rob_Kimbell Yes. Rest in Peace Jacob.
1303271432382750720 2020-09-08 17:58:17 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @PaulAndersonNE6 @WendyPuerto A conundrum!
1303271207224184832 2020-09-08 17:57:24 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Perhaps if @PublicHealthW @PHE_uk had any sense of the problem they would demand the Government reintroduces FREE school meals for ALL pupils. Goodness these people could pay for it out of their budget. Fresh hot meals with Vegs and a banana or yoghurt for lunch.
1303269058670931974 2020-09-08 17:48:51 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> What @PublicHealthW @PHE_uk just do not understand for many children &amp; adults. Fish and chips, Chicken and Chips etc may well be the only meal they get a day. Hence the reason for Breakfast Clubs at Schools. PHE too high/Middle class do gooders who know nothing about being poor.
1303246860409278464 2020-09-08 16:20:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BillEtheridgeuk It’s a TEN FOR ME.
1303245853734338561 2020-09-08 16:16:39 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The majority voted for  Brexit. The majority do not care about a trade deal with the lying, duplicitous EU. Sadly our politicians lack backbone and knowledge of governing. After over 4 years WE should be ready to go. Another delay? With this shower I will not hold my breath.

1303234356824211456 2020-09-08 15:30:58 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I thought Public Health England was abolished, or was that just another headline quickly forgotten by @BorisJohnson ? Now PHE is ordering Chip shops etc to cut the portions of chips by a quarter. Get rid of these troublesome nannies.

ANTI BRITISH , anti democratic he should have been consigned to the dustbin of history. Remove the whip from him.
1303213174288769026 2020-09-08 14:06:47 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Antipolluters Gordon Brown for instructing Police not to arrest the rape gangs of mainly Pakistani men raping underaged, girls throughout the Country. Arrest for Aiding and Abetting serious Sexual Assaults. Should get life imprisonment.

Much along the regional setups we have today. Scotland. Wales. N.Ireland would just meld into Ireland.England, English would be no more, we all would be Citizens of the United Regions of Europe.

This proves she is not. she should demand of the woke Police Chiefs to police ALL demonstrations equally. AS in Dover so in Westminster or Broxbourne. The laws are there. USE THEM.  https://t.co/Liw6DiaRS2
1302850157713784832 2020-09-07 14:04:18 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @WendyPuerto It looks that, they too, are waking up to the facts that our Police are NOT doing their job and this PM and cabinet have taken their eyes off the home front. @BorisJohnson must change the Home Secretary, &amp; place a heavyweight in that job who will take no nonsense from the Police.

1302844517805166592 2020-09-07 13:41:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Westminster Hour last evening on BBC R4.

When decent men and women objecting, as you do, to illegals, are set upon by yobs in uniform. Look at the videos. They look very old police officers. We’re they security men dressed as police? Very concerning.

Or as CIVITAS has the role of taking illegals to their luxury hotels, did they employ these security men and give them police caps and tops. @pritipatel has to identify them. yobs.

1302337821647220739 2020-09-06 04:08:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I will say it again. The Home Office is not fit for purpose. The PM @BorisJohnson  should now realise that he will have full on trouble from the White population who appear to be regarded as the punchbags by the police and security staff. @Pritipatel must go. Bring A new broom in

1302273571398602752 2020-09-05 23:53:09 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Another incredible blunder by the Home Office. Turning their storm troopers on unarmed veterans and Loyalists. Sorry,  this may well escalate now. Is this the straw that broke the back of the silent majority. @BorisJohnson what are you doing?
1302272894765019141 2020-09-05 23:50:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @oflynnsocial @JulieBishenden Patrick, My concern is, if true, Angela Merkel, Ursula Van de Leyon &amp; Charles Michel are going to take over the EU/GB Trade talks. I am sure they would demand that @BorisJohnson leads our team. Merkel will wrap him around her little finger.
1302266890195218432 2020-09-05 23:26:36 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Antipolluters @100Pringle Yes, a really good choice. His heart is in Great Britain.

1302208801160953857 2020-09-05 19:35:46 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Hoe long can the Guardian continue. The new DG must cancel all the Guardians plus ensuring that job vacancies for the BBC appear in the SUN, Daily Mail, DT, STAR, Times and ALL regional  newspapers. No BBC employee would want to be seen carrying a Guardian in to work now.
1302206869440811009 2020-09-05 19:28:06 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @chambers4447 Possibly but he is not house trained.,

1302204835157209089 2020-09-05 19:20:01 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Barnier to be sidelined. The EU negotiating team for deal with GB Will now be Angela Merkel, Ursula Van de Leyon &amp; Charles Michel. I betThey demand that Boris Johnson negotiates for GB. MERKEL will have him for breakfast. UTurn coming. (Did Merkel get a phone call from MAY?)
1302198941497331713 2020-09-05 18:56:35 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @Riccardo_Giovan No, it was Princess Di plus Rita Moreno, John Travalta, Andrew Neil, Kay Burley, Joan Collins and more.
1302197883551256576 2020-09-05 18:52:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Who would you want the BBC to part company with?
1302197715552604160 2020-09-05 18:51:43 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> With the DG’s UTurn. Allowing Lineker to continue abusing the majority. No doubt the DG can cancel the contract if thousands of us write to him complaining about the ridiculous caveat, as Lineker gets a monstrous fee from us he should get the boot. (football parlance)!

1302104563386785793 2020-09-05 12:41:34 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> On the the Afghan interpreters. WHO within the Home Office is making these disgraceful decisions?  which official/s. Which Minister? Has @pritipatel any authority? @BorisJohnson  send in a Rottweiler Minister to sort this Ministry out Top to Bottom. A job for Geoffrey Cox.QC. MP.
1302103297126543361 2020-09-05 12:36:32 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson You must sack @pritipatel. The DM’s editorial on the plight of Afghan interpreters who greatly assisted the Armed Services in that hellhole, Helmand Province, Afghanistan. WHO  Home Office say they cannot find Accommodation for them. Home Office needs a clear out.  https://t.co/z8cybLP8Qe

A two step regime, used in other countries is far preferable and will cut quarantine. Conservative backbenchers want it. Airline industry too. UTURN

1301948883484971008 2020-09-05 02:22:57 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @bluenobby @KayBurley It shows that NOBODY takes any notice of this awful woman. Goodness we should give her to the EU.

1301941738089709568 2020-09-05 01:54:33 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Goodness @BorisJohnson has made a decision. Tony Abbott confirmed as adviser to the Board of Trade. No salary. Why not. If you want the best pay them. Excellent decision. Now announce the end of Devolution.

1301788338664411138 2020-09-04 15:45:00 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @robertwlk I was, last week. Very spooky.
1301788198276866049 2020-09-04 15:44:27 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The problem we have is turf wars between Ministries. Goodness. Forget the Country. For goodness sake @BorisJohnson  Your cabinet is a disgrace. Get it sorted. Tests at Airports. FORGET Isolation. End Devolution. We want a UNITED Kingdom. OR if not an ENGLISH Parliament.

The woman has lied to us and whilst doing so her Home Office was booking all the hotel spaces they could. This was all pre planned. Are the government in charge of the Dingy service too?

1301767559654584320 2020-09-04 14:22:26 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The train services in Italy and Portugal are so efficient. What went wrong here? Bring in the experts from India To run our railways we will find them more efficient and reliable.

1301764983483756545 2020-09-04 14:12:12 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I truly was overjoyed when @BorisJohnson won the Conservative Party Leadership and thus became Prime Minister. His government is now a car smash. No leadership, no direction, UTURNS and nothing from Him, other than running on the spot. Jokes over now. Either get on or get out

This is utter madness. Our Country is now reached The Dogs. Perhaps that other tweet is best a carriage for wearing masks and one for not.
1301761841727766529 2020-09-04 13:59:43 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @KeyserSosse R.I.P. Justin a Brave young hero on foot patrol slaughtered by the ghastly, cowardly hidden bomb. Yet another soldier fighting, to keep our streets safe, In that God forsaken Helmand Province, Afghanistan.
1301760711274700800 2020-09-04 13:55:13 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> The PM @BorisJohnson obviously cannot make a decision. He faces this way, then that. But there is no argument that will convince the majority of people in keeping the politicians vanity project “Overseas Aid”.  You also need to stop, saving billions, HS2. Ask the people. On both.
1301759026913579009 2020-09-04 13:48:32 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> I went to Spain and other European countries prior to joining the Common Market. Their roads were like most of the U.K. roads today. Now they have really well made roads, we don’t. Their infrastructure is better than ours. What went wrong? We joined the Common Market.
1301757918736416768 2020-09-04 13:44:07 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson It is about time YOU reminded the EU of our once great Fishing Industry killed off by the Conservative PM, Edward Heath. The Common Market did not  and has not given a F*** about US or our fishermen since. I hope ALL our Navy will patrol our waters From 1.1.21.

1301755626390016000 2020-09-04 13:35:01 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Tony Abbott, former Australian Prime Minister, more Brexit than Nigel Farage. A great negotiator. YET the coward in charge, @BorisJohnson , Is thinking of NOT hiring him to assist the Board of Trade In negotiating trade agreements. BORIS are you a LEADER ? Hire this man today.
1301753689045114880 2020-09-04 13:27:19 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson can run on the spot! Great. But can he Govern?

I have tried those but they either flick my hearing aid away, which dislodges my spectacles etc. So I go without hearing aids and spectacles. Returning to my car and placing them back in their rightful places. I still think the masks are of little or no use.

1301503932909465600 2020-09-03 20:54:53 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> To protect these islands and the danger of White People being the minority by 2066, white couples must have at least two children. Migrants limited to one wife. IF they wish more they will return from whence they came. They will also be limited to have only one child.
1301502046026293251 2020-09-03 20:47:23 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> Barnier has now pronounced we “can have the waters but NOT the fish!” Prepare for the start of the new 100 years war. Call for the Archers of England. (No dear not the R4 Archers...bows and arrows)
1301499388230017025 2020-09-03 20:36:49 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> If schoolchildren have to wear masks, why do MP’s sitting in the House of Commons not? They must, surely,  set an example at all times. Plus they act like petulant scholars.

Patel has lied to Parliament and to the people by telling us she will send them back. They CAN Change the law on benefits to migrants but don’t.

You have not seen how towns &amp; Cities have been turned into Foreign lands, you are now going to raise taxes to pay for them. ARE we MAD or those we elected? NO Amnesty.
1301426304588361728 2020-09-03 15:46:25 +0800 <Eastwood1A1> @BorisJohnson A measure which will effectively STOP illegal migration. Emergency Legislation ensuring that ALL Migrants will NOT be entitled to Benefits for five years. AND only British Subjects will be able to vote in ANY election in England and Wales. We need a new Aliens Act.

Since Aged 15 whenever I went to a dance women danced with women. I wish her luck. BUT if a male dances with another male it will be Goodnight Vienna for me.

Then call in a reputable barber and have a really good style and trim. Ask Dominic Raab for his. Clothes make the the man. You are the PM. Have some pride in your appearance.  https://t.co/RfNyNROSB4

Sounds very much like the 13 week Cambridge Diet in the 80’s. The DM has pushed more diets down the throats of their readers than anyone, what success have they been.
