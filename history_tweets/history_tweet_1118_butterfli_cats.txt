1339254061338595329 2020-12-17 01:00:25 +0800 <butterfli_cats> This is what I keep saying.. I don't understand their fears !
1338912354046709760 2020-12-16 02:22:35 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @eir @eircare are you down? We are having issues with wifi connection in the house? No tv, no house phone. Can you help please?
1337739348096245760 2020-12-12 20:41:29 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @AineMcMahon Not the way I pour them ðŸ¤£
1337356536230895618 2020-12-11 19:20:19 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @JimIreland12 100% Yes. I think he is worried for his wife and her ill health and this is influencing his decisions.
1337053421816442880 2020-12-10 23:15:51 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @frillyflossy I read yesterday that An Post are handling 3 million packages up from 1 million at the same time last year... I think it must be manic at the moment!
1336395512627466242 2020-12-09 03:41:33 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @faslj19 @clare_eliza You are very tunnel visioned on this.
1336395114160250887 2020-12-09 03:39:58 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @faslj19 @clare_eliza The % of people who die from covid does not warrant them being vax'd. At that rate we would have to be vax'd for everything and would have no immune systems left. As there is a small % of mortality for many common diseases.
1336394630359867392 2020-12-09 03:38:03 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @faslj19 @clare_eliza You will find the stats show that the vast majority of those who died had underlying illnesses or were very old. Anyway you keep resorting to name calling and now cursing so ima leave it there. It's unfortunate people aren't open to debate anymore.
1336394054943338499 2020-12-09 03:35:46 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @faslj19 @clare_eliza Well no. If they are vax'd then they are protected? Those in high risk categories will most likely all want to receive the vax. So that leaves healthy people who might choose not to. Very very slim chance of a healthy person dying from it.
1336393326661165062 2020-12-09 03:32:52 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @faslj19 @clare_eliza But if those in high risk categories receive the vax then they should be protected... they don't need a healthy person to be vax'd to protect them surely? As the vax they received should do this no? Genuine question.
1336392460256284672 2020-12-09 03:29:26 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @faslj19 @clare_eliza Look maybe you've lost someone and are sensitive. And I am very sorry if you have. But I do wear my mask and I've already said I will probably take the vax as my personal health may require it but I don't think every single person needs to take it. And I do believe in pro choice
1336391924840865797 2020-12-09 03:27:18 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @faslj19 @clare_eliza I'm lost at this stage, who exactly did I target?
1336391485504315394 2020-12-09 03:25:33 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @faslj19 @clare_eliza Oh right I targeted someone by asking legitimate questions?
1336390997878706179 2020-12-09 03:23:37 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @faslj19 @clare_eliza 3.Also the risk to a healthy person dying from covid is alot smaller than that of a person not wearing a seatbelt and surviving a crash.
1336390881507741696 2020-12-09 03:23:09 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @faslj19 @clare_eliza 2.But I will emphasise yes you wear a seatbelt because if you don't you could kill someone else in the car. If you don't take the Vax you are not putting others at risk,especially if they have been vax'd.
1336390541362270221 2020-12-09 03:21:48 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @faslj19 @clare_eliza Seriously dude take a breath. There is no need for name calling. The one thing Covid has managed to do is turn people against each other.
1336389099352154116 2020-12-09 03:16:04 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @faslj19 @clare_eliza I answered your question. Can you read that yes below. Gosh this covid situation has made people very tetchy.  https://t.co/12orzargGc
1336379778371293186 2020-12-09 02:39:02 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @faslj19 @clare_eliza The car analogy is different. As if you wear your seatbelt in a car you can still be killed by a person not wearing theirs in the car!
1336379520107081735 2020-12-09 02:38:00 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @faslj19 @clare_eliza Yes. I know where you are going with this. So if you believe everyone should take or be made take the covid vax? Why is that not the case for the flu vax? Also if high risk people are vax'd and said vax works then they won't catch it from a positive person surely?
1336375660646969344 2020-12-09 02:22:40 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @faslj19 @clare_eliza I wear a mask.I will also possibly get the vax.I am not anti vax or anti mask. Im also pro choice + I don't believe everyone needs to receive the vaccine just like not everyone receives the flu vax but those at risk do. So hop on down off your high horse there.
1336361985223634952 2020-12-09 01:28:20 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @faslj19 @clare_eliza Rat lickers?
1336357179629113344 2020-12-09 01:09:14 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @Independent_ie It's not anti-vax it's anti forced tax, there is a very distinct difference!
1336281819591946243 2020-12-08 20:09:47 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @clare_eliza Are you frontline staff? Or in an at risk group?  If not then what is the need to vaccinate healthy people?
1335310647018577927 2020-12-06 03:50:41 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @ronan_glynn @HSEImm @RCPI_news The thing is the majority of these vaccines were administered to at risk groups not pushed upon whole populations like this covid one will be.
1335217230519349249 2020-12-05 21:39:29 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @adriancummins That's really shittt of those people.
1332764054746697728 2020-11-29 03:11:26 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @FergalBowers Does this not ring alarm bells?! All cases of flu/influenza are showing up as positive Covid cases with that over sensitive PCR test ðŸ™„
1332479178692849670 2020-11-28 08:19:27 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @CillianDeGascun Just give it a rest. You lot are relentless.
1332435458312314880 2020-11-28 05:25:43 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @Niall_Boylan @rtenews Lying through their teeth at this stage.
1332402678421463046 2020-11-28 03:15:28 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @IrishTimes This is completely ridiculous. Our case numbers do not negate this. Never mind the fact that this virus is nowhere near as deadly as was initially believed back in March.
1332045575940935684 2020-11-27 03:36:28 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @higginsdavidw Do you not think we need to start learning to live alongside this virus? The death rate does not warrant these continuous lockdown. Our ICU numbers were good even before level 5 as it is more younger people getting the virus and they rarely need ICU admission
1331140435088117761 2020-11-24 15:39:45 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @Independent_ie And what. It's not the killer disease the government and media want us to believe ðŸ˜¡
1328473509102841857 2020-11-17 07:02:21 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @EubanksRoburt @Niall_Boylan Well with English being my first language, I feel it's appropriate to spell correctly and not give up and spell any aul way as would seem to be the case with many many others. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ™„
1328380285092843522 2020-11-17 00:51:54 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @Niall_Boylan Robbing businesses of their lifeline to staying afloat during these ridiculous times.
1328379762050551809 2020-11-17 00:49:50 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @ClaireByrneLive Absolutely not. That would be a step further to this becoming a police state.
1328062992471166978 2020-11-16 03:51:06 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @Independent_ie Oh fook off.
1321155025503223808 2020-10-28 02:21:18 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @thejournal_ie And as soon as everything reopens the numbers will rise again. What we need to wake up to is that the death rate for this virus is alot lower than was first thought.
1321045571835224064 2020-10-27 19:06:22 +0800 <butterfli_cats> The world has gone mad. Brainwashed.
1320878581162123264 2020-10-27 08:02:49 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @Independent_ie Can't abide body shaming.
1320443363028574209 2020-10-26 03:13:25 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @rtenews This government has lost the run of themselves.
1320439336224067585 2020-10-26 02:57:24 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @thejournal_ie Very low death rate. Empty and underwhelmed hospitals according to @LeoVaradkar so why are we locked down? Complete farce.
1320290838308655104 2020-10-25 17:07:20 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @Niall_Boylan They are either open or they're not.. this is a load of nonsense.
1318644188532084743 2020-10-21 04:04:08 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @DavQuinn @higginsdavidw NPHET are full of shit.
1318307170082054146 2020-10-20 05:44:56 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @MikBurrows We need more of this.
1318288320737280004 2020-10-20 04:30:02 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @ShaneBeattyNews Vodka straight from the bottle.
1317582371722567680 2020-10-18 05:44:51 +0800 <butterfli_cats> Couldn't agree more!
1313839510959120388 2020-10-07 21:52:04 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @ShaneBeattyNews So flu vaccines were rolled out in Nursing homes in the last couple of weeks. Seems a coincidence that there is a spike in covid numbers. Perhaps the overly sensitive PCR test is picking up the general flu virus and not Covid-19.
1310168577182490624 2020-09-27 18:45:05 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @ShaneBeattyNews Ah I see you mean the 'island' of Ireland. I think this is misleading to report these numbers when this is not the figures usually reported. Scaremongering! The North have different Covid restrictions to us, you can't just lump their numbers in with ours!
1310161894230175745 2020-09-27 18:18:31 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @ShaneBeattyNews Where are you getting these numbers from? Is it not 1,802?
1309975250059309056 2020-09-27 05:56:52 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @StefPreissner Seriously... all out in the fresh air. You can't expect people to stay locked up in their homes for a virus who's death rate has severely dropped in the last few months... otherwise we're guna end up dealing with a soar in suicide deaths.
1309592693488656394 2020-09-26 04:36:43 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @rtenews ZERO deaths... wake up guys this is not as serious as was first believed !!!
1309463722168135680 2020-09-25 20:04:14 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @ShaneBeattyNews Those numbers are tiny. TBH I think young people need to get it to create some sort of immunity.Otherwise we will be forever hiding away.This virus is not going anywhere.Unfortunately those who are vulnerable have to take personal responsibility and protect themselves.
1309461924938121221 2020-09-25 19:57:06 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @ClaireByrneLive Yes please. The daily numbers and them repeated on the hour on every radio news segment is doing more damage to people's mental health than anything else. Weekly updates would be suffice.
1308497038712229888 2020-09-23 04:02:59 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @higginsdavidw @HSELive This does not surprise me in the slightest.
1307795938715619329 2020-09-21 05:37:04 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @Independent_ie So so sad ðŸ˜¥
1307775970934427649 2020-09-21 04:17:43 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @DavQuinn Tiny death rate.
1307061325160472576 2020-09-19 04:57:58 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @DonnellyStephen Go and shite.
1307035603465367554 2020-09-19 03:15:46 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @ShaneBeattyNews Brainwashed.
1306629503024848899 2020-09-18 00:22:04 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @GininaTeacup1 I don't think were being told the whole truth here. This is all part of their narrative so we don't try account the sharp rise in cases to the reopening of schools. They'd rather us believe people in their homes are the cause.
1305567446607245323 2020-09-15 02:01:50 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @MaiaDunphy I am this thin. I struggle to put on weight, I have always been tiny and when people comment on my "being too skinny" it is just as hurtful as telling someone they are too fat.
1305564492860981249 2020-09-15 01:50:05 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @thejournal_ie This rise in numbers is coming from all the extra testing since schools opened. Most positive cases are asymptomatic and wouldn't be picked up only for the school related contact tracing. Locking down again is pointless.
1304452490692374532 2020-09-12 00:11:23 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @Markf0879 @Independent_ie Maybe I should have worded that differently. The rise in numbers are coming since the school reopenings due to them testing everyone with a sniffle.
1304342334067310592 2020-09-11 16:53:40 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @Independent_ie The spread is coming from the schools! Stop trying to pass the blame!
1303796039846105093 2020-09-10 04:42:53 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @KellieSocialist So sorry for your loss. The same restrictions should be lifted for women labouring on their own and even worse miscarrying on their own ðŸ˜¥
1302644615695171585 2020-09-07 00:27:33 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @rtenews Are the for real. It's worse this country is getting. Maybe if the airport had better transport links we wouldn't need to be dropped off or picked up. ðŸ˜¡
1302343403766722561 2020-09-06 04:30:38 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @KellieSocialist @HSELive It's an awful test. Some adults, especially those with severe anxiety really struggle with it. I don't know why they have to practically swab your brain. Surely there's an easier test.
1301917407301324802 2020-09-05 00:17:53 +0800 <butterfli_cats> Yes please!!
1301917204267577345 2020-09-05 00:17:04 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @fionaisafenian @JamesKavanagh_ Utterly ridiculous statement.
1301916306955001856 2020-09-05 00:13:30 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @Niall_Boylan Yep. Unless there is a significant change in deaths or hospital admissions we don't need to be hearing the numbers every day.
1301622313151012872 2020-09-04 04:45:17 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @Niall_Boylan @DonnellyStephen Their rules get weirder by the day. Why on earth do they need to know what I eat? ðŸ¤¯
1301609228201844737 2020-09-04 03:53:17 +0800 <butterfli_cats> @MaiaDunphy I really don't understand why they want this information though. There has to be a reason? What is the reason?
