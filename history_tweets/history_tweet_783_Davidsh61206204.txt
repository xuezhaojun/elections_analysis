The rest of the hospital will be quite.  That's why we have not had the MSM in hospitals showing us scenes like they did back in March in France Italy Spain etc.

1303733263685615619 2020-09-10 00:33:26 +0800 <Davidsh61206204> @emilyhewertson Too many far left people in the civil service and advisory committees having to much influence over government policies. Never has a conservative government pandered to the opposition as this one 🙄
1303732514830331910 2020-09-10 00:30:28 +0800 <Davidsh61206204> @Ten10designs @SkyNews Answer two questions and I'll reconsider my opinion of you  Name a us president that walked into North Korea (other than the democratically elected president of the United States of America Donald Trump)  or Name a war pres D Trump started or sent us troops to for the first time?
1303728728741117957 2020-09-10 00:15:25 +0800 <Davidsh61206204> Anyone man fleeing so called war zones leaving behind their grandparents, mothers,wifes, sisters, daughters and aunts etc will NEVER get any sympathy from me. But 99.99% are not refugees just scammers conning idiots out of their money.

1302664871583068162 2020-09-07 01:48:02 +0800 <Davidsh61206204> Mass immigration has brought the UK Housing shortages Mass stabbings Mass rapes of young girls Terroism  Increased crime No go area's for women and white people More attacks on the LGBT community More attacks on emergency services But hey at least shallow idiots can virtue signal
1302576482766684160 2020-09-06 19:56:48 +0800 <Davidsh61206204> @SolEsco1 @CliffM60 @ukhomeoffice It comon knowledge that NGOs have been educating these ILLEGAL migrants on how to con the system to get the most rewards from sucker countries. Saying you are a refugee does not make you one.
1302574313577512960 2020-09-06 19:48:11 +0800 <Davidsh61206204> If far left strike it's bad,  schools, hospitals, kebab shops and dole qués will be hard hit. But if everyone the looney left call far right racists strike the whole country is fu*ked 🤣

1302078501437177856 2020-09-05 10:58:00 +0800 <Davidsh61206204> @RitaPanahi The 93% is selective and unreasonable to use as a stat. Like you could  have 1000 peaceful protests consisting of 3-10 people and and riot and looting rampage masquerading as a protest of 100,000 people but the stat would state only one out of 1000 was not peaceful, anti trump-

1301745105594994688 2020-09-04 12:53:13 +0800 <Davidsh61206204> The EU country with the most billionaires is Germany, the same country that wants masses of unskilled illegal migrants.  Many billionaires have seen their fortunes double in the last 7 year's. Don't for a second think this is a humanitarian issue.
