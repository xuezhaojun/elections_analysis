Our most successful minority groups, more successful than the majority, are deeply ethnocentric.
1341844351983316993 2020-12-24 04:33:18 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @EarlNoahBernsby This is the problem with building society around non-discrimination. Humans discriminate by nature.

It takes compassion, which is a true virtue, and  muddles it with sentimentalism. It quickly becomes the ‚Äúsuperior virtue of the oppressed‚Äù and lends itself to moral exhibitionism.

The ‚Äúuniversal brotherhood‚Äù beckons us to destroy ourselves as a People in the name of utopian morality and goals, to ignore that our interests and moral ideals do not often coincide.

I always had access to a Nintendo growing up and have generally kept up with the Zelda games.  I bought a PS3 to play BluRays in 2008 as I recall and have played maybe a half-dozen games since.
1338597783452884994 2020-12-15 05:32:36 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @Peter_Nimitz I agree. I play 2-3 console games per year.  The final editions are such a better deal and fix most issues.

Locke‚Äôs belief in the perfectability of humanity from a tabula rasa leads directly to this contemporary liberal behavior. Innate qualitative differences in humans, groups or individuals, punctures that idealism and is thus heretical.

Every major conservtaism sneering at skepticism, usually without engaging a single piece of evidence, is a lawyer.   Perhaps the law inures you to manipulation of the system?
1338558463354400769 2020-12-15 02:56:21 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @wil_da_beast630 It means that ‚Äòmoral‚Äò claims come before science for contemporary liberalism.  Liberalism has become indistinguishable from religious fundamentalism.

Here you are using the Woke term ‚Äúscientific racism‚Äù to disparage contemporary science.  Also typical of Woke hypocrisy, you actively use and condone non-white racial solidarity.

After all your denial, you just admitted that your brand of  ‚Äùequality‚Äù strips us of national self-determination. ‚ÄôAnti-racism‚Äò comes before basic sovereignty, the right to exclude for any reason we see fit, because it might hurt someone‚Äôs self-esteem.

That common statement on immigration presumes stable to shrinking native populations with relatively high workforce participation (i.e. like the US).

Truman allowed Communists to remain in his administration, despite his vaunted loyalty initiative until McCarthy blew the whistle on him.  His personal laxity with traitors like Harry Dexter White is egregious.  Truman was inept in response to the Korean War.

One problem with your position is that culture feeds into reproductive differences.  Chagnon showed that Yanomami who were more lethal had substantially more kids.
1334605162686468097 2020-12-04 05:07:21 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @PsychRabble You are also conflating classical (liberty-freedom) liberalism and modern (justice-internationalism) liberalism.   The later shares a core focus with Marxism and associated leftist thought.

Yes, appeasement of leftist terror began in Russia before the Revolution, then spread to the West after WWI.  The whole myth of McCarthyism is the liberal appeasement  of out-right treason in a nutshell.
1334602597328584704 2020-12-04 04:57:09 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @wil_da_beast630 Genetics also applies to populations that evolved apart for thousands of years.   Until you embrace that reality, your otherwise quality analysis is fundamentally lacking.

The preference for internationalism, the cultural relativism, the omnipresent racial double-standards,etc. that work against national sovereignty and the notion of  a  people.
1334578397247234048 2020-12-04 03:20:59 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @DIorioNathaniel @post_liberal No chance. A supermajority of Americans had colonial ancestry in 1976.

Neoliberal crony capitalism and defense industry excess has been grotesque.   1) Virtually all of that has been done lawfully, not by Executive Order.   2) Some vital industry support (e.g. farm subsidies) is warranted.

You‚Äôre not even curious to know if Democrats are, for example, by using ballot harvesting where illegal or otherwise exploiting mail-in voting.

1327452199727742976 2020-11-14 11:24:01 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @wil_da_beast630 The problem with the ‚Äúculturalist‚Äù position is that it is hard to reconcile with what we know of Evolution. Also culture and behavioral genetics beyond IQ will intertwine.

It‚Äôs amazing how people who don‚Äôt like Trump for aesthetic reasons are totally incurious about the possibility of fraud.
1327339913235161089 2020-11-14 03:57:50 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @wil_da_beast630 It‚Äôs not semantic.  It‚Äôs about fundamental truth claims.  You either accept genetic factors in disparate outcomes between populations or you do not.  The Gouldian orthodoxy is that no such group-level differences exist.

1327322062533234689 2020-11-14 02:46:54 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @wil_da_beast630 There is no ‚Äúit‚Äôs all genes camp.‚Äù  That‚Äôs a flagrantly dishonest strawman created by the ‚Äùit‚Äôs all racism‚Äù orthodoxy.

He barely got to do anything because of four years of being tied up in the Russia Collusion conspiracy, Ukrainegate plots, Federal judges trying to block his every move, and disloyalty by the NeoCon-neoliberal element of the GOP.

The claim Trump ‚Äúgot played‚Äù is childish, ignores the sequence of events, and insults the South Koreans.

Turkey is a treaty ally, has Sasse called to withdraw from that treaty?  Trump should be credited for trying to work with Kim, which brought praise from South Korea btw for his approach. It‚Äôs sad it failed, but he tried.
1324847205052641281 2020-11-07 06:52:42 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @Xeynon @EsotericCD The entire point of this discussion is to distinguish between policy and personality. Nothing about a more civic nationalist, anti-interventionist, pro-working class, and anti-Marxist social theory platform requires Trump‚Äôs personality, nor does basic wit and dunking.

He also had the childish ‚Äúkisses dictators butts‚Äù remark, which makes every President engaged in diplomacy guilty.  Ben should advocate total economic disengagement from China (or war) to match his purity posturing.

1324841864382459904 2020-11-07 06:31:29 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @EsotericCD Yes, of course.  In fact it will only get stronger without Trump, because an articulate, polite, and personally moral Trumpist would eviscerate most of the left‚Äôs strategy, which is running against Trump's personality. Trump has changed the Overton window.

I‚Äòm not saying it to be mean, just to be honest that he‚Äôs likely to be forced to resign at some point for health reasons outside his control. But, then again, the D powerplayers may just work around the problem.

Again this failure to use basic logic, which you are otherwise capable of, shows that my TDS remark is on the mark.

Everyone expected Trump to get crushed by Clinton, so they had no need to use any fraud apparatus.    Besides isn‚Äôt Trump a mortal threat to democracy, etc., are saying you wouldn‚Äôt cheat to save the U.S. from such a fate?
1324622135604621312 2020-11-06 15:58:22 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @GSpellchecker You are so venomous towards Trump, you would unlikely to be mature or honest enough to consider any evidence.

Like most New Atheists with TDS, your relentless arrogance blinds you to basic logic like that, which is why a breezy debunking thread full of weak man rebuttals or non-answers appeals to you.
1324543419264368640 2020-11-06 10:45:34 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @a_centrism It‚Äôs been bothering me the past 24 hours.  I think the GOP must have been embarrassed to expose such corruption during the Cold War and after the Civil Rights Act it became taboo to hit black racial demagogues too hard.
1324542414288158720 2020-11-06 10:41:35 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @HeadAsploding @varadmehta You spelled ‚Äúfighter‚Äù wrong.  Romney had only an emasculated response after Biden told, black voters, in bombastic racial demagoguery out of a farce, that Republicans would ‚Äúput y‚Äôall bald in chains.‚Äù  It‚Äôs about time some pushed back.
1324538192092000257 2020-11-06 10:24:48 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @a_centrism I‚Äôm glad Trump is fighting back. I don‚Äôt care about his rhetoric when my instinct is material fraud by the other party. If Nixon had fought in 1960, instead of playing by the Marquis of Queensbury rules, maybe Democratic urban machines could have been reformed.
1324508577680117760 2020-11-06 08:27:07 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @EliLake Your failure to address points made repeatedly in the comments, namely how polls impact donations and demoralize Trump voters speaks volumes.
1324506850344067072 2020-11-06 08:20:15 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @EliLake Very obvious reasons.   1. To demoralize Trump voters (this impacted me). 2. To create a bandwagon effect for Biden. 3. To provide cover for ballot stuffing.
1324492715959050241 2020-11-06 07:24:06 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @reluctantcentr5 No, because Republican voters don‚Äôt need their hand held to vote. Despite being ‚Äúthe party of stupid‚Äú our rank and file can follow simple rules and set themselves up to vote.   The mass mail out made fraud inevitable.  Reckless beyond belief.
1324472868114223104 2020-11-06 06:05:13 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @Inductivist I don't understand how a generation of Republicans, including Nixon, just took it lying down after 1960. You'd have though they would never allow urban ballot shenanigans again, but no this problem just has festered for sixty years after.

1324424699791642624 2020-11-06 02:53:49 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @reluctantcentr5 Now that I agree is a problem.  Nixon just stood there and took it in 1960.  He didn‚Äôt even force reform to prevent such misconduct when he became President.
1324424248710946817 2020-11-06 02:52:02 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @alimhaider Why have Republicans not done things to prevent this over the decades, especially after the 1960 election?  Democrats have been cheating like this since the 19th Century.
1324423598140919808 2020-11-06 02:49:27 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @reluctantcentr5 It‚Äôs not ‚Äútenuous.‚Äù  The Democrats have never had to implement voting reforms that prevent such abuses precisely because Republicans roll over and take it, no matter how obvious.

1324168650496987137 2020-11-05 09:56:22 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> Yep.  As middle finger to the IC, who seditiously conspired against hi‚Äôm for four years.
1324166330040266752 2020-11-05 09:47:09 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @DLaferson @MsMelChen Telling you are one of the BLM racial demagogues, while clapping over the worst warmonger this nation has seen in the last fifty years.
1324165984228274176 2020-11-05 09:45:47 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @MsMelChen You are such shallow, smug bitch at times.  McSally didn‚Äôt lose twice because of Orange Man Bad.  McCain was a horrible person and the sort of cheap labor, warmonger that the GOP should leave in the dust.

I hate seeing that mendacity succeed and it feels like a wind of justice than his gains among all minorities, plus Jews, offer an irreducible counter.
1324109386101399552 2020-11-05 06:00:53 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @KenGardner11 @Bombshell_Squad Weird. Apparently Bombshell blocked me at some point. I never had anything but pleasant interactions with her.  I somehow got unfollowed from her, then asked to follow her when she was only listed as protected (not blocked).
1323965415979020290 2020-11-04 20:28:47 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @Henderburn I‚Äôm partly Jewish, but your resort to that sort of slimy identity play shows exactly how cosmopolitanism is difficult for its own proponents to defend.
1323962791636598784 2020-11-04 20:18:22 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @Frances_Coppola Laughable hypocrisy given the blind vitriol in the initial post.  Bye.

1323961940322914304 2020-11-04 20:14:59 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @Frances_Coppola No, it‚Äôs a harsh dose of reality that cosmopolitanism and clientism politics do not allow for the loyalty and trust needed to maintain a nation.
1323961162485047298 2020-11-04 20:11:53 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @HBatakus Those white voters are the type who voted for Biden to be ‚Äúnot racist.‚Äù
1323960862579724289 2020-11-04 20:10:42 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @Frances_Coppola Because Democrats and leftism in general have no true, fundamental loyalty to the American People.  They are at best utopian idealists and more often just oligarchs using clientism politics based on racial demagoguery and pursuit of cheap labor.

1323929182015873024 2020-11-04 18:04:49 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> This quote just makes me so happy. Even if the Democrats yet steal the election in the coming days, they know that four years of racial demagoguery, unhinged accusations, and projection failed. The close result and demographic details deprive them of their Puritanical sanctimony.

1323849044712566784 2020-11-04 12:46:22 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @EdAsante77 It‚Äôs embarrassing. It‚Äôs like Paul Ryan‚Äôs animus being channeled by puppets.

To be clear, we needed as a collective Weatern civilization to not fight WWI at all.  Our elites turn against us in favor of utopian projects in its aftermath.

Ig Imperial Germany won WWI, then there would be no betrayal, which was my point.   The European powers were not worth a drop of American blood in any case.
1323773146751619072 2020-11-04 07:44:47 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @Pseudoplotinus @johnmilbank3 The world would likely be a far, far better place if Imperial Germany had won WWI.  No Nazis, no Holocaust, no crippling tyranny of Western guilt that has us on course to civilizational suicide.

A people create a nation.  The Preamble spells this out.   ‚ÄùPost-liberalism‚Äù is an ambiguous term and realism about human nature in the face of idealism is again a core founding element.

It means a loyalty rooted in time, place, and shared connection, not abstract idealism. America tries to meld conservative patriotism with secular liberal legal principles.

Franz Boas had already begun his crusade, for example, decades earlier.  Also, no group tried harder to assimilate than German Jews, including disproportionate sacrifice in WWI. Look how it ended.

1311727485969596416 2020-10-02 01:59:38 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @theoctopiehole @artistfuly The villa was not abandoned untouched in the 1st Century BC.  It's not a time-capsule like Pompeii.    The archaeological evidence does not back you up.

Their is a direct line between the Democratic leadership and the authoritarian and mob Woke groups, with Kamala's bail fund for rioters in Minneapolis a perfect example of how close she is to the radicalism.
1311726250390552576 2020-10-02 01:54:43 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @atheneblue False. I already cited the analysis of genetics of the Italian peninsula.  The overwhelming probability is them being light skinned based on their ancestry.  The burden of proof is on Woke propagandists to show they had non-European ancestry that would give rise to darker skin.  https://t.co/2kaR3ZRJ1Z

1311529371581116417 2020-10-01 12:52:23 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @theoctopiehole @artistfuly So why did you reference the poem, when you admit that the reference has nothing to do with race?  I might buy some MENA origin patricians with skin that dark from the later Empire, but not the late Republic when Catallus actually lived.

No one is arguing that there were no people with darker skin in the Roman world. That's just a dishonest strawman Woke ideologues use.

1311352815952912384 2020-10-01 01:10:49 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @theoctopiehole @artistfuly Are you really too stupid to understand a metaphor of ‚Äúblack and white‚Äù as non-racial terms?  The mere presence of darker skinned Mediterranean people in art (again you fixate on a purity strawman) in no way provides evidence on those specific men.
1311351173471903746 2020-10-01 01:04:18 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @theoctopiehole @artistfuly You thread is a running act of sophistry. Conspicuously unable to defend that choice of skin tone for those specific men in that time you try to obfuscate and deflect to a purity strawman (‚Äúlily-white‚Äù). Tryong to pass off North Africans and Egyptians as ‚ÄúBlackness‚Äù is shameless.

I‚Äôm sure there is skin tone research on North Africans of you are actual an intellectually ho east or curious individual. We both know you are neither.  You are Woke instead.
1311097647172788224 2020-09-30 08:16:52 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @VeneficusIpse 1. The burden of proof is on you claiming the dark skin tone used by the OP has a basis in reality for the men depicted You lot have utterly failed to provide that, which is why you keep attacking a strawman of ‚Äúlily-white‚Äú or trying to misrepresent other Mediterranean peoples.
1311087927540084736 2020-09-30 07:38:15 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @VeneficusIpse There‚Äôs so much dishonesty to unpack it would take an essay. The relentless conflation by contemporary racial zealots of black Africans with North Africans is shameless dishonesty. Even in North Africa few people have medium dark skin, let alone as dark as the OP used.
1311074977307717632 2020-09-30 06:46:47 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @VeneficusIpse Now you are just denying straight-forward scientific analysis because the religion of Wokeness takes precedence over fact, just like in most other faiths.  It's sad how academia is returning to its clerical roots.
1311074445163864064 2020-09-30 06:44:40 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @VeneficusIpse Sigh.  I specifically specified a "material" number.  Your churlish response just underscores your bad faith.
1311056786510635008 2020-09-30 05:34:30 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @VeneficusIpse The pigments used in that bust were carefully reconstructed. Your hand-waving dismissal is pure bad faith.  I have a strong rational. Mosaics cannot be blended, which is essential to skin tone, so it uses exaggerated differences, on top of the limitations of the colors available.
1311055607319785472 2020-09-30 05:29:49 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @VeneficusIpse They‚Äôre not ‚Äúclearly depicting‚Äú anything. Pigments are an art in and of themselves and would have been much more limited in that era as drawing and painting were much less developed overall.   There no evidence of any material presence of people with non-tanned skin that dark.
1311043306881572864 2020-09-30 04:40:57 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @VeneficusIpse Neither of those is as dark as the OP‚Äôs art. Mosaics are a poor comparison and if the darkest you have is a relatively crude fresco it shows how her choice is racial propaganda, signaling paternalism towards dark skin people and the omnipresent oikophobia of cosmopolitanism.  https://t.co/BU0Qtmjc1j

The 1986 illegal immigration amnesty was a major blow to the rule of law, a striking contrast with say Eisenhower‚Äôs policy, a sign that cheap labor costs would be paramount.

The 1986 Amnetsy was a prelude to the revocation of the social contract.

Reagan was not a conservative.  He was a neoliberal and much of our disintegration as a nation traces to him.   Jimmy Carter was the last truly American President.

There‚Äôs a very weird asymmetry in media and political support at the moment.

You immediately contradict yourself because both Vikings and Muslims are ‚Äúright wing‚Äù in a global perspective. In era of liberalism, European Christians have won probably 90% of wars except against one another.  You‚Äòre trying to simply a complex issue.

The issue is the ‚Äúright-wing‚Äù in this context are Burkean liberals and Christians.  They are restrained by nature and the Marxists now build their tactics around that restraint.

The definition was created to shield anti-white racial bigotry from being encapsulated by the term, to shield affirmative action, and to obscure in particular the cross-racial crime rate.
1303446900675235840 2020-09-09 05:35:32 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @EPoe187 Yet people take it literally all the time, and indeed most of the time.  It‚Äôs a phrase that has empowered radical egalitarianism at odds with biological reality since the French Revolution.  It‚Äôs catching up with us.  America may begin and end around that phrase.

1303444981823217666 2020-09-09 05:27:55 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @EPoe187 Not true.  Americans have overwhelmingly accepted anti-white racism for forty years.  Racial double standards in government policy became law.  Cross-racial crime disparities became taboo to discuss. ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù began to have a pejorative sense in media such as the NYT and CNN.

Thinking about it over lunch, I think linear algebra would be better taught in conjunction with programming matrix math and relating it to real-world situations. It was very tedious.

On top of conservative constraint and (small-r) republican virtues, a society has to be a steward for the natural environment and set rules for an otherwise market-based economy that allow the middle 80% of the populace to make a living wage and live with dignity.

1301024830569943041 2020-09-02 13:11:06 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @adashek @McFaul Since you admit his comment is completely in keeping with norms, it indicates the the malevolence lies with his detractors, not him.
1301021210172518402 2020-09-02 12:56:42 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @unseen1_unseen Agreed.  NeoCons exhibit these fundamentally un-conservative traits:  1) preference for novelty and ‚Äôthe Other‚Äô 2) utopian/unconstrained worldview 3) disavowal of hierarchy, yet elitist 4) avoidance of combat
1301017859410112512 2020-09-02 12:43:24 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> Superb thread end-to-end. This articulates why I consider myself a conservative, even though I am not a religious traditionalist.

It‚Äôs not ideal, but there were a lot of seventeen-year olds fighting in the Revolution at that agre and you, for example, can join the Marines at 17.

The cops in good faith had no reason to believe he was being truthful, even though he was in fact in the process of dying from a fentanyl overdose.
1300969907647963136 2020-09-02 09:32:51 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> @pspoole Sorry for your loss.   Ross is of the ‚Äòalways counsel defeat‚Äô school of conservatism.

1300920890742288384 2020-09-02 06:18:04 +0800 <la_chatte_verte> Wow. A 20:1 ratio. You don‚Äôt see that every day.   The NYT hates America.

Kyle defends her.  Even if she were not his sister, a man should defend a woman against any aggressor.  What sort of veteran are you exactly?

Kyle was fried on first      Hitting someone in the head with a skateboard is not ‚Äúapprehending them.‚Äù  The third man shot admitted to his friend that he intended to kill Kyle and regretted not doing so.
