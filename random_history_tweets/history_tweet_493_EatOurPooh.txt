1343669207922335746 2020-12-29 05:24:37 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @Cernovich Yeah imo they got destroyed only in the last 8 years, 2nd term of Obama they all adopted SJW shit and pressed it on kids. Always been bad but it‚Äôs gotten so much worse...
1343668751024214019 2020-12-29 05:22:49 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @Cernovich Look it‚Äôs not over til the 20th as far as pardons/taking action. But at the same time the writing is on the wall and people really need to be planning/organizing bc Biden admin will want revenge on trump supporters... also we must #EndTheLockdowns
1343632793134395399 2020-12-29 02:59:56 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @famjc20 @BoSnerdley Uh no Supreme Court is totally controlled they are still allowing lockdowns (unconstitutional) and the judges trump appointed won‚Äôt do shit... now we‚Äôre stuck with these cowards for 40+ years^
1343440939063377922 2020-12-28 14:17:34 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @JoseGananGlez @DC_Draino We had 4 + years to kick out RINOS, they always hide and then emerge from the shadows after riding others coattails... time for a new party #PatriotParty
1343439503810326528 2020-12-28 14:11:52 +0800 <EatOurPooh> Just need 1 in house and 1 in senate. As far as this is concerned to me it‚Äôs not over until Jan. 20th. And even then I don‚Äôt think Trump should concede at all. But he has to act and act fast...
1343434750753722368 2020-12-28 13:52:59 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @jacobbradley67 @TheAlexManasseh @Cernovich Like when you have power use it to change things, otherwise it will be used against you and when you‚Äôre out of power things will be way more unfair... he could still seize voting machines but I bet he won‚Äôt do it bc Mitch would get madüôÑ
1343434370863030274 2020-12-28 13:51:28 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @jacobbradley67 @TheAlexManasseh @Cernovich Could‚Äôve had DOJ investigate? Oh wait he appointed Barr a former bush official instead of Rudy or tom fitton from judicial watch, literally any conservative with a backbone...same thing with fbi and cia appointments just career officials no one with morals...
1343265444686422016 2020-12-28 02:40:13 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @sharonfeinstein @DrEricDing No not millions way less than 1% of people have long term effects. Hate when ppl hype up shit like this to make virus seem even more scary

1342208104944054285 2020-12-25 04:38:43 +0800 <EatOurPooh> Would be great to have Sidney Powell or Rudy as WH counsel someone with a backbone!

1341838442628599810 2020-12-24 04:09:49 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @yueqel @annaleehogan Lmao Biden‚Äôs not evil, just a puppet. And he was ‚Äúelected‚Äù with less counties than any president ever, losing 18/19 bell weather counties, and with close to zero signature rejections which is unheard of. If u run the vote totals thru 2016 sig rates trump wins every swing state...
1341703639098929152 2020-12-23 19:14:09 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @Isaac69132590 Ngl Durham investigation feels like slow walked coopted bs should have been released before election...

1341649425043697664 2020-12-23 15:38:44 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @PhiloctetesFoot @MikeSin86 @Cernovich Well ya but this year everyone should get it. We pay taxes not our gov they should give us the money back this year.
1341648977368891395 2020-12-23 15:36:57 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @Cernovich This guy gets it. Most important tweet I‚Äôve seen in ages. When u spend trillions on stimulus and only give 10% to the ppl it‚Äôs fucked. First stimulus could have given every man women and child 13,000$ but it all went to big corps
1341646385964314625 2020-12-23 15:26:39 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @e_h_n1 @RetroRadTV @AndrewYang Yupp love that channel. It‚Äôs always been my dream. Kinda feel like I missed out cuz I didn‚Äôt have enough money/time to do a run during corona n those records will most likely never be broken lol
1341637115298373632 2020-12-23 14:49:49 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @yueqel @annaleehogan And I‚Äôm open minded I‚Äôll even admit some trump supporters would blindly support him no matter what. I have my issues: if he got us into a pointless war, or if he flipped and supported amnesty, but he hasn‚Äôt done either of those thingsüòÇ so trump 2020üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
1341635658343981057 2020-12-23 14:44:01 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @yueqel @annaleehogan Okay no I‚Äôm genuinely interested what makes trump a fascist? And I want to hear by the dictionary definition of fascim? And I don‚Äôt think hurting libs feelings counts lmao
1341635128796344320 2020-12-23 14:41:55 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @yueqel @annaleehogan And no I was saying I have no moral qualms about this policy or enforcement of the law at our border. Partially because you would have to be on the darwin awards for sheer stupidity to make that journey with a child...
1341632940950908928 2020-12-23 14:33:14 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @yueqel @annaleehogan They (Obama) did at a rate of 20%. ‚ÄúSystematically‚Äù well I guess if it‚Äôs so bad you would be okay if hitler only killed 20% of what he did? I on the other hand think it‚Äôs extremely disrespectful to the memories of holocaust survivors to even compare this to fascism...
1341631870170218497 2020-12-23 14:28:58 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @yueqel @annaleehogan Look all I‚Äôm saying is morally this issue is a nonstarter for me. Anyone who makes that journey has already risked death and way worse and aren‚Äôt fit as parents. I‚Äôm asking you why you care about it? and if so do you also have an issue with separating 20% of families? (Obama)
1341630485517242368 2020-12-23 14:23:28 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @e_h_n1 @RetroRadTV @AndrewYang Love cross country road trips and that stretch is especially beautiful... you ever heard of the cannon ball run?
1341629705955532801 2020-12-23 14:20:22 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @yueqel @annaleehogan Yes it is a hoax in the way it was perpetuated disingenuously by media coverage. Do you approve of Obama separating 20% of kids or is it only fascism if they spend the money on enforcement to file cases for everyone?
1341628930302889986 2020-12-23 14:17:17 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @yueqel @annaleehogan Would a fascist/racist get more votes from minorities than any republican since 1960? I‚Äôm sorry but all of these arguments seem like fear mongering to me.
1341627460119638018 2020-12-23 14:11:27 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @yueqel @annaleehogan Yes logical fallacy because people use it to cry out ‚Äúohhh the fascism he‚Äôs hitler the worlds ending‚Äù when it‚Äôs literally the same as Obama policy just choosing to prosecute all cases instead of 1/5... I don‚Äôt think going from 20% to 100% is fascism do you?
1341626656415506432 2020-12-23 14:08:15 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @yueqel @annaleehogan People who bring kids on that trip would use them as props, and many times not even their own kids. If you are a parent who‚Äôs dumb/selfish enough to bring your kid on that trip around traffickers, murderers etc you are unfit to be a parent period...
1341625827243515904 2020-12-23 14:04:58 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @yueqel @annaleehogan 1/2 Crossing the border is a dumb idea, studies have found almost a majority of women who do are sexually assaulted, by coyotes. Many people are able to live normal lives in mexico it‚Äôs not a terrible place, it‚Äôs economic migration not refugees...
1341624715119632385 2020-12-23 14:00:32 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @yueqel @annaleehogan Okay so this is being pedantic but they were separated under every administration, the thing trump did was prosecute everyone crossing the border instead of 1/5 cases under obama. Every prosecution results in separation.
1341623875260563459 2020-12-23 13:57:12 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @e_h_n1 @RetroRadTV @AndrewYang Aye so is that your Vette lol? I drive a v8 bmw, Aside from the important stuff in politics I‚Äôve always wanted to raise the speed limits... but most ppl will never vote for itüôÑüôÑ
1341620953437134848 2020-12-23 13:45:36 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @e_h_n1 @RetroRadTV @AndrewYang Yeah it‚Äôs ridiculous. And yes there are some teachers who get treated badly by public schools, but they act like a mob fighting school districts with unions... their pay would be much higher in charter or private schools, but they don‚Äôt want that bc it means accountability...
1341619586651795456 2020-12-23 13:40:10 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @e_h_n1 @RetroRadTV @AndrewYang Yeah. Honestly I think it should be even more radical than that. Steve Jobs once said give parents 5k or whatever is spent on Edu per student per year to parents and they can use it for homeschool, private school or if they are suckers go to public school...
1341619033733537792 2020-12-23 13:37:58 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @yueqel @annaleehogan In 2014 we had ‚Äúkids in cages‚Äù and that is actually where the stock file photo comes from. President Obama that year actually used the detention as a deterrent from a migration wave that year... and did so publicly on TV telling immigrants not to come into our country...
1341617620072751105 2020-12-23 13:32:21 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @yueqel @annaleehogan So first off disregarding all the other stuff, and keeping an open mind, have you looked into the ‚Äúkids in cages‚Äù situation? Because I hear this fallacy/hoax from a lot of people who don‚Äôt know the full story, and it gets annoying having to explain it...
1341616327245574144 2020-12-23 13:27:13 +0800 <EatOurPooh> K now pardon Snowden, Assange and Ross
1341611690517999617 2020-12-23 13:08:47 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @e_h_n1 @RetroRadTV @AndrewYang Ehh teachers are paid okayish, but a lot of people are not cut out for teaching/dealing with kids so it turns into a shit job for them, which they begin to resent along with the pay... pub education is fucked tho private or homeschool is the way to go if you can afford it...
1341610094467887106 2020-12-23 13:02:27 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @annaleehogan @yueqel Just goes to show how leftists are a cult. Very hard to find one that will have a debate on the facts. Or even accept that others may have a different opinion. Funny thing is conservatives are the ones fighting for free speech right now AKA what used to be liberal dem values...
1341427122011852801 2020-12-23 00:55:23 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @OcrazioCornPop @Cernovich @HawleyMO He needs to act on Jan. 6th only way for these GOP senators to redeem themselves!
1340922062228041728 2020-12-21 15:28:27 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @realDonaldTrump pardon everyone and concede nothing! I am behind you and so are all 75 million of us! #StopTheSteaI #MAGA #GeorgeWashington
1340761751068045317 2020-12-21 04:51:26 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @ali every trump supporter that follows me should call their senator if you don‚Äôt want election stolen:  https://t.co/8keyHCQSbN
1340761248489680898 2020-12-21 04:49:26 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @realDonaldTrump Insurrection act! Trump supporters want martial law. And independents will support it too once there is criminal prosecution for voter fraud... no one wants a stolen election and majority of public believes it was stolen...
1340755505250258951 2020-12-21 04:26:37 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @jossjoking @LabdogEric @ChuckCallesto Honestly if trump declared martial law for a limited period of time and asked patriots to step up I‚Äôm sure they would in droves, even more than BLM etc there is a silent majority that stays silent until their country and freedoms are on the line...
1340448556268867593 2020-12-20 08:06:54 +0800 <EatOurPooh> Dear house + senate republicans, I will never vote for you again if you do not stand with our President on January 6th. Doesn‚Äôt matter what you say about so called ‚Äújudges‚Äù or anything else, you will have betrayed our country. 92% of Republicans feel the same way, so be warned...
1340030524023328769 2020-12-19 04:25:48 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @newtgingrich Then do something Newt! Sick of seeing conservative leaders sit back and do nothing while democrats riot, control the media and rig our elections...
1340012527611240449 2020-12-19 03:14:17 +0800 <EatOurPooh> Just gotta put this out there to people who think trumps done if he loses election appeals-Joe Biden‚Äôs 6 years older than him and medically more like 20. Trump is here to stay!!! #MAGA
1339979714606354432 2020-12-19 01:03:54 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @PoliticalBetsWC @JeremyH66390564 @Barnes_Law Protest works, look at how blm and pussy hats were able to push their crap on everyone thru protests... if GOP doesn‚Äôt get smart w stuff like that change is never gonna happen. And it needs to happen fast before they take away elections completely
1339978007231033349 2020-12-19 00:57:07 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @PoliticalBetsWC @JeremyH66390564 @Barnes_Law Needs to not just rally but encourage conservatives to get out and protest! For some reason republicans have a thing against protesting and it‚Äôs not just bc they have jobs/families. Look at how many show up at rallies... Imagine if they all went downtown w proud boys...
1339820605709955072 2020-12-18 14:31:39 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @JeremyH66390564 @PoliticalBetsWC @Barnes_Law Honestly at this point trump should just go 3rd party and tear down Mitch McConnell/Romney etc at all costs. To the ppl that say we need to support the GOP leadership imo they‚Äôve already sold out our country and will do it even more if there isn‚Äôt an alternative to stop them...
1339812950169804800 2020-12-18 14:01:14 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @irishxs @Kennykwh1120 @realDonaldTrump Of course texas is harmed by fraudulent voting of other states...
1339484380708941824 2020-12-17 16:15:37 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @misfit203 Still a good ad tho, we need more of them! Just don‚Äôt like people like Crenshaw co-opting and only voting for vanilla stuff while keeping in place policies that bleed our country dry. Lots of GOP do this üôÑüôÑ
1339483562651889665 2020-12-17 16:12:22 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @misfit203 Honestly I‚Äôd be wary of Crenshaw he‚Äôs not America first on a lot of issues(endless war, deep state funding, and he supports H1B and other visas aka take in more people to replace Americans even during an economic downturn)
1339481959689572352 2020-12-17 16:06:00 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @AssisT_styx @mason50289103 @LLinWood Not surprised Clarence Thomas is the only one with balls on SC. He grew up dirt poor in the south. Rest of em are all spoiled/entitled catholic prep school assholes used to falling in line and playing their role all for more money and power with zero morals #ACB #kavanaugh
1339480384514494465 2020-12-17 15:59:44 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @AssisT_styx @mason50289103 @LLinWood IMO probably would sell out his country for money/season tix and beer. Always wondered how Supreme Court decides their arguments -it‚Äôs a big club and you‚Äôre not in itüëÄ
1339455869134774272 2020-12-17 14:22:19 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @saynotopas @DAM0013 @cjtruth @SaraCarterDC @RandPaul Yeah Rand Paul is the most underrated senator, and probably the only one that truly respects the constitution. Ted Cruz is up there but I get a weird feeling from him and he supports endless war...
1339242580488445953 2020-12-17 00:14:47 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @realdonaldtrump please pardon Snowden, Assange and Ulbricht. Would be biggest accomplishment of your presidency, endear you to millions... and who knows they might just help you root out the corruption and voter fraud of deep state...
1339222121399148546 2020-12-16 22:53:29 +0800 <EatOurPooh> Yes do it! And one for election integrity!!! Now is essential to get these people in power while you still can! #maga #DrainTheSwamp  @realdonaldtrump
1339100868487081990 2020-12-16 14:51:40 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @NoWarChristian U know they could do it w guns next right? Square pay already did...

1339092789209018368 2020-12-16 14:19:34 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @realDonaldTrump @OANN DONT EVER CONCEDE!!! We are behind you 100%!
1338906654784573442 2020-12-16 01:59:56 +0800 <EatOurPooh> We need to impeach/primary Mcconell his only achievement is judges and they‚Äôve been a total failure look at the Supreme Court... courts never do shit for republicans because we pick corporatist cowards. And now we‚Äôre stuck with barrett, gorsuch and kavanaugh for years to come
1338904888529580033 2020-12-16 01:52:55 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @tcw5speed_ I‚Äôm really disappointed in republican donors and most activists they are not doing enough and allowed this shit to happen... 20 something James okeefe doing more to expose fraud than kochs, adelson, heritage etc. where is the leadership/money?
1338903871335305219 2020-12-16 01:48:53 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @tcw5speed_ Either way because of fraud and ballot stuffing, people were less enthusiastic for biden than they were for Hillary, and he ‚Äúreceived‚Äù 14 million more votes than her. If they can install biden they can install anyone...
1338902884537274371 2020-12-16 01:44:57 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @tcw5speed_ As long as he doesn‚Äôt concede there‚Äôs still a chance... if biden gets in Imo it‚Äôs time for trump to form a new party because the republicans have been so weak and full of traitors. He can do that too because reps will never win another election without him, and probably won‚Äôt
1338901926528880640 2020-12-16 01:41:09 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @tcw5speed_ Yeah all the media is shilling for China and biden it‚Äôs ridiculous, but not surprising they‚Äôve been selling out our country for years in more subtle ways. This year it‚Äôs just more obvious then ever...
1338689605596549123 2020-12-15 11:37:28 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @DiamondCraftV2 @TomFitton @JudicialWatch He called trump a ‚Äúdeposed king‚Äù and hid the active investigation into hunter biden... good riddance Barr. I can‚Äôt believe we didn‚Äôt know about the investigation during impeachment hearings... investigation involves burisna Ukraine and China exactly what trump said #firewray
1338434815671078912 2020-12-14 18:45:01 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @Waycooljr62 @jdhehejhs @fstonenyc @joncoopertweets @janestreet @NBCNews Well if signature matching is such a common mistake then wouldn‚Äôt it equally affect republican sigs? I don‚Äôt think they have a monopoly on good handwriting? ü§£ #voterfraud
1338433558969462784 2020-12-14 18:40:02 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @MountweisInfo @realDonaldTrump Or not even Rudy just anyone with a backbone that would be brave enough to do something, like fuck almost seems like someone else decides who gets inü§Ø? Obama and Bush put in loyalists everywhere idk why trump didn‚Äôt? #firebarr #firewray
1338432232260767744 2020-12-14 18:34:45 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @MountweisInfo @realDonaldTrump Yeah I was dumbfounded when he put barr as AG and Wray at fbi. Why even fire comey if you‚Äôre going to put in a dipshit like Wray? All seems controlled or influenced in some way... the two most powerful domestic agencies appointing people like that instead of Rudy...
1338420886429380609 2020-12-14 17:49:40 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @Andrew_King0 @hugolowell @Cernovich Like imagine for a second if Twitter/fb and the media censored and banned democrats accounts?.. And blacklisted their supporters? You‚Äôre still allowed to support biden in trump country and won‚Äôt be threatened/cancelled or have your property damaged...

Individual rights are what this country was founded on and if we lose all of that because of ‚Äúracism‚Äù or a virus we are done for.

Honestly democrats (with antifa) are closer to communism than russia...

That they are physically doing to us? And Trump sanctioned them, mostly because of the collusion BS... I don‚Äôt see why we couldn‚Äôt get along with russia like all the other european countries?

It would be like if the USPS wouldn‚Äôt deliver WAPO to its readers for having stories about trumps leaked taxes...

1316145632214577154 2020-10-14 06:35:46 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @CecchiniPeter Fed stimulus is enormous right now, is there any way to cut it back with out killing the economy though? Seems to me like low rates should continue unless major tax cuts or public works projects are passed?
1316144490248200192 2020-10-14 06:31:13 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @CecchiniPeter I think it‚Äôs fine as long as it‚Äôs not exposing at risk people,  we should have directed most of the stimulus to people that have underlying conditions and let everyone else get back to work, everything would be normal by now

I think it‚Äôs just anti cronyism... when you have people with guaranteed seats in power for 50 years that‚Äôs not democracy... trumps almost the same age as biden. Only difference is trump spent 50 years getting rich in business, biden did the same on tax payersüí∞üí∞üí∞

If you‚Äôre in sports it‚Äôs best not to get into politics, and if you do then don‚Äôt demonize the other side and definitely don‚Äôt kneel or strike from games that‚Äôs poor sportsmanship...
1312156181545148417 2020-10-03 06:23:07 +0800 <EatOurPooh> Why isn‚Äôt melania going with him she has it too... this is really fishy atleast we have a picture now
1312155709765632000 2020-10-03 06:21:14 +0800 <EatOurPooh> If no photos were allowed did he even board the helicopter???
1312110261583581184 2020-10-03 03:20:38 +0800 <EatOurPooh> It‚Äôs like protection money for the mob to leave them alone

1311489113896312832 2020-10-01 10:12:25 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @stayhugh6 @Patti1302 @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Biden was better? He told the sitting president to shut up and called him a clown... I‚Äôm sorry but anyone that pretends biden or antifa are civilized needs to shut up...
1311413777695350784 2020-10-01 05:13:04 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @Shafzhan_1 @cnni Yeah that‚Äôs thing with biden they keep him inside end his campaign days at 9 am and barely take any questions from the media. It‚Äôs on purpose because the guy isn‚Äôt all the way there üß†. Somehow he was able to go thru this debate but it all seemed so scripted...
1311252537371062272 2020-09-30 18:32:21 +0800 <EatOurPooh> Yeah trump dragged biden down in the shit. You‚Äôd think biden who‚Äôs tryna run as the ‚Äúdecency‚Äù candidate would know better than to disrespect the office... calling the President a clown too. This justifies anything Trump says against him now
1311250266579070989 2020-09-30 18:23:20 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @cernovich @scottadamssays maybe I‚Äôm in the minority but I feel like trump went easy on biden. He didn‚Äôt use any nicknames or have major verbal kill shots like with Hillary. He taunted Hillary, called her out and made her cackle insanely...
1311249311762538497 2020-09-30 18:19:32 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @Shafzhan_1 @cnni I feel like at first trump was trying to be civil and go easy on biden, he got way more speaking time so I think it is a close win for trump. Next debate if he wants to win he needs to get nastier on biden. Really tear him apart like he did to Hillary in 2016
1311247944532680705 2020-09-30 18:14:06 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @Shafzhan_1 @cnni If biden was supposed to be a talented debater like Hillary, it would be considered a win for trump. Biden was below average but that‚Äôs all he had to do was avoid huge mess ups. Then again trump held his own against Wallace so it‚Äôs kind of a toss up
1311239736091054085 2020-09-30 17:41:29 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @YoungBlackAndy1 @ReekTalince @steph_veras U know hunter slept with Beaus widow after his death then dumped her for a hooker on one of his crack binges? #truestory look it upüòÇ
1311238699472961536 2020-09-30 17:37:22 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @FrazzleDazzzled Shits scary for people workspaces like that especially because so many high paying jobs are dominated by leftist ideas. Not necessarily leftist people but leftist ideas. There‚Äôs more conservatives out there than you might think, but most are forced to be silent
1311221972433432578 2020-09-30 16:30:54 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @Cernovich Trump only mentioned coke. Hunters been caught smoking crack in a DC strip club. Joe loves to talk about beau, but after he passed hunter literally fucked his widow, then left her for a hooker. I don‚Äôt see why trump wouldn‚Äôt bring this up. Imagine if don jr did that??
1311221463572074496 2020-09-30 16:28:52 +0800 <EatOurPooh> @Cernovich Trump needed to rattle biden, get inside his head, verbally trap him and put him on the back foot... he did with the police endorsement line but needed to do this more. Ask biden to disavow. Seemed to me like Prez studied a lot for this debate, but was holding back on biden a bit
1311075458276941824 2020-09-30 06:48:42 +0800 <EatOurPooh> Chris Wallace is a registered DemocratüëÄ

1310295642518945792 2020-09-28 03:09:59 +0800 <EatOurPooh> Why would you need to do this if you are being peaceful? Not saying we don‚Äôt have a right to this, but why would you need to unless you are being violent, and is the ACLU encouraging political violence and hate?
1310014316632895488 2020-09-27 08:32:06 +0800 <EatOurPooh> This is so true, she is everything that democrats don‚Äôt want in women, she has an impressive career AND a family. Like it or not kids are not raised by government/society they are raised by families and family is crucial.
