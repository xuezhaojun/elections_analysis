If they did they'd quickly go out of business, consequently, private school pupils grow up believing they are untouchable and that conforming to convention is for other people.  https://t.co/XkHI6a4ZqE

Farage's ever presence on TV and Tory austerity policies coupled with the media barons' fear of the EU's tax avoidance crackdown is what led to 23 June 2016.

To Remainers like me, the Brexiters' real intent was glaring, however much they dressed it up.

Elements for bringing it about, like pockets of British Nazi sympathisers lingering from WWII, had been in plain sight for decades before the Referendum, not least 'reality TV'.   https://t.co/ri2sUG0403

Big Brother spawned a whole host of 'reality TV' shows, including The Apprentice, which gave us far-right monsters Kate Hopkins and Donald Trump.

Bazalgette Productions thought it could monetize this, hence their disgusting TV show Big Brother.
1337929686110720000 2020-12-13 09:17:49 +0800 <factgasm2> @boyceland @Tim_Pilcher Most reality TV shows have, at their core, elements of the Milgram Experiment and the Stanford Prison Experiment. These experiments were conducted to see how far ordinary people would take cruelty towards others. In that respect, Goggle Box is different.

From there I can get a MacBook Pro, write the app and - if it catches on - put a permanent end to demagoguery.
1332843878995542017 2020-11-29 08:28:38 +0800 <factgasm2> @JMPSimor The court is very quiet. There is little activity there so I could get a hearing very quickly and the session would be digital, namely it could be done over the internet - no need for judges to arrive from Jakarta - thereby making the process super quick.
1332843257269665792 2020-11-29 08:26:10 +0800 <factgasm2> @JMPSimor What does the PTUN do? It has only one function: To resolve disputes involving government departments, such as when staff aren't doing their jobs thus causing members of the public to suffer unnecessary delay.
1332842703218905088 2020-11-29 08:23:58 +0800 <factgasm2> @JMPSimor At the PTUN, an official appeared to suggest that its the Penetapan which is the date from which the Land Registry had 30 days to issue the new certificate to my wife and I.  In other words, it appears that we should have had the certificate no later than 10 June, six months ago.
1332842225324048387 2020-11-29 08:22:04 +0800 <factgasm2> @JMPSimor On Friday, furious at the intransigence of the primadonnas at the Land Registry, I visited a fourth court, the PTUN (Pengadilan Tata Usaha Negara).
1332841947354992645 2020-11-29 08:20:57 +0800 <factgasm2> @JMPSimor Which is the date of the ruling?

1332841727535714304 2020-11-29 08:20:05 +0800 <factgasm2> @JMPSimor In the original District Court ruling, the judges stated that the Land Registry here in Bali must issue the new property certificate to my wife and I no later than 30 days from the date of the ruling. The question is: What is the date of the ruling under Indonesian Law?
1332841229113954304 2020-11-29 08:18:06 +0800 <factgasm2> @JMPSimor I won my court case in Bali nearly three years ago( 12 December 2017) but it went to appeal at the Hugh Court, cassation at the Supreme Court and there have been several other events since then (Perberitahuan, Aanmaning and Penetapan).

1326429503598424064 2020-11-11 15:40:12 +0800 <factgasm2> @lucyallan To the ordinary man, on the face of it, egalitarianism in democracy sounds like a noble thing, but it's the oxygen on which populists thrive. If you can get the less educated majority to dismiss the more educated minority, you can get a nation to vote against its own interests.
1326429077679480837 2020-11-11 15:38:30 +0800 <factgasm2> @lucyallan When people get sick, why do they seek the advice of a doctor? Because when it's necessary to get things right, you rely on the best person. Adam Smith may well have enshrined this in his 'Division of Labour', but the principle has been understood since the dawn of civilization.

1325361302341029889 2020-11-08 16:55:33 +0800 <factgasm2> @mikegalsworthy Deluded by Britain's past imperial prowess, Brexiters fooled themselves into thinking the UK could simply ride roughshod over international norms and conventions. Remainers always knew this to be nonsense. Brexiters are about to learn these lessons the hard way.
1325360417317728262 2020-11-08 16:52:02 +0800 <factgasm2> @mikegalsworthy For anyone with an understanding of events and international agreement, Brexit was always doomed from start. The Good Friday agreement always meant there could never be a hard border separating Northern Ireland and Republic and for that reason alone, Brexit was always fantasy.
1325359941482373121 2020-11-08 16:50:08 +0800 <factgasm2> @mikegalsworthy The Brexiters should have known there was a chance that Trump might be out of power by late 2020. For Brexit not have damaged the UK, they should have worked back from that date, created  schedule of events that needed to happened, in particular agreement with the EU.
1325359428988788739 2020-11-08 16:48:06 +0800 <factgasm2> @mikegalsworthy The Brexiters brought failure upon themselves by failing to have a plan for leaving the EU. They had since January 2017 to make Brexit happen. Yes, the UK has left the EU - that was the easy bit - but their failure to plan has imperilled the UK's economy and much more.

He knows there are mail-in ballots still to be counted and they are likely to favour the Democrats - in which case he loses. Therefore, better prime peoples' minds now that he won't be conceding and there's going to be trouble ahead.
1323893321148878848 2020-11-04 15:42:19 +0800 <factgasm2> Is Trump claiming victory now simply so that later, after all the mail-in votes have been counted and Biden wins, he can "But, I already won! You can't take victory away from me now!" The suggestion is that he knows he has lost.

Honestly, what is the point of spending billions and billions of taxpayer money if you're not going to enforce basic public precautions: mask wearing, social distancing, minimal socializing etc.  It's just wasted money otherwise.

1317680098149949440 2020-10-18 12:13:11 +0800 <factgasm2> Note that the then Labour govt only drew down half the amount they requested (¬£1.1 billion) and was repaid by Spring 1979.  Also note: ¬£1.1bn in 1976 equates to ¬£9.3bn in today's money - meaning that the Tories have now spaffed more on COVID than Labour borrowed from the IMF.

However, as time has gone on, and Brexit has shown itself to be the disaster Remainers said, "Project Fear" has quietly disappeared.

Biden gave as good as he got, telling Trump to shut up and calling him a clown. Trump evaded condemning far-right extremist groups, instead worryingly telling them to 'stand-by'.

Given the enormous amounts of UK public funds being handed over to tiny UK companies, Brits should refer to the Johnson govt the same way - grifters.
1304298013251137536 2020-09-11 13:57:33 +0800 <factgasm2> @Takru5 @mikegalsworthy While it was a member of the EU, the UK indeed had more opt-outs than any other country. The trouble was that it wanted even more opt-outs again, such as ATAD. Essentially it wanted all the benefits of membership without the obligations and couldn't get them. Hence the referendum
